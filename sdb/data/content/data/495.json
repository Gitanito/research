There were also present :\nLord Charles Hope, Miss Ina Jephson, Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart.,\nMr W. H. Salter, Mrs W. H. Salter, Dr F. C, S. Schiller, Mr S. G.\nSoal, Admiral the Hon. A. C.

Their names and addresses are\ngiven above.\nThe Monthly Accounts for October were presented and taken as\nread.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE.\nGramophone Records of a Sitting with Mrs Osborne\nLeonard.\nStudents of trance mediumship have long felt that it is necessary\nto make a comparative study of the Controls of different mediums\nif the real nature of these Controls is to be understood. In the case\nof the mediumship of Mrs Leonard there is a still more important\ntask, the comparison of the different Personal Controls of this\nmedium, a task which might throw much light on the whole ques-\ntion of survival, communication, and the modus operandi of trance\nmediumship. The Society has devoted much attention to this\nsubject, but the work has been greatly hampered by the difficulty\nof studying these Controls at leisure, detached from the conditions\nof the actual sittings. It is clear that this can be achieved only by\nobtaining permanent and mechanical records of these sittings.\nThis objective has now been attained by the Society.\nWith the kind co-operation of the medium and of the Rev. W. S.\n\fJanuary 1933 Gramophone Records of a Sitting 3\nIrving, who allowed one of his sittings to be used for this purpose,\nan entire sitting with Mrs Leonard has been very successfully\nrecorded on twenty-three gramophone discs. Owing to the expen-\nsive nature of the experiment (which has cost nearly \u00a3100), only\nten of these discs have been converted by The Gramophone Com-\npany, Ltd., into permanent twelve-inch single-sided records. These,\nhowever, are quite sufficient for the purpose of the experiment.\nFinances permitting, it is hoped in time to make a series of records\nof the most important Personal Controls of Mrs Leonard and\nControls of other trance mediums. The present experiment has\nfully demonstrated that the technical difficulties can be successfully\novercome.\nThese ten private records, which are obtainable only from the\nSociety, preserve the entire Personal Control and the most interest-\ning portions of the Feda Control, including the beginning and the\nend, as well as examples of the so-called direct voice. As many\nstudents of psychical research will no doubt wish to possess these\nrecords, which give a graphic rendering of a sitting with Mrs\nLeonard, it has been decided to place them on sale to Members and\nAssociates of the Society at 5s. each or \u00a32 10s. for the complete set\nof ten records. This price is only a little above the actual cost of\nthe records to the Society.\nApplication for records should be made to the Secretary, The\nSociety for Psychical Research, 31 Tavistock Square, London,\nW.C. 1, not later than the end of February 1933.\nA VERIDICAL DREAM.\nWe have received through Miss E. B. Gibbes, a member of the\nSociety, the following report of an apparently veridical dream, the\ndreamer being Miss Geraldine Cummins, whose automatic writings\n(Paul in Athens, The Scripts of Cleophas, etc.) are well known. The\nnames and addresses of all persons concerned are known to the\nSociety, but, except in the case of Miss Gibbes and Miss Cummins,\npseudonyms are given here.\nThe first mention of the dream occurred in a postscript to a letter\nwritten by Miss Cummins, in County Cork, Ireland, to Miss Gibbes\nin England on the morning of 1 August 1932 as follows :\n\" Any news of Alice ? I had a very sad and vivid dream of her\nlast Tuesday night [2 August]. I won't seal this for fear it will\ndelay it.\"'\nDetails of the dream were noted by Miss Cummins on 3 August\n1932 as follows :\n\" Night of Tuesday August 2nd.\n\" I dreamt in the small hours of the morning that I saw Alice F.\n\u2014\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1933-\nin a dim room. She was dressed in the clothes in which I had last\nseen her in London in the spring\u2014a white silk blouse and dark\nskirt. Her face was ghastly pale and she looked terribly ill. She\ngreeted me brightly and at first I was very glad to see her, but felt\nso sorry she looked so ill. Then she came quite close to me until it\nseemed as if her forehead was about to touch mine. I shrank away\nin frantic terror, feeling that at all costs I mustn't let her touch me.\nShe smiled cheerily then and made a joke which I can't remember.\nBut I distinctly recalled her saying, '\nI'm quite all right.' After\nthat she disappeared and then I saw Edith [an intimate friend of\nAlice's] in another room in the same house. I went down a stair to\nit. I told Edith that Alice had said she was '\nquite all right '\nso I\nsupposed it meant she was going to get well again, that she seemed\nquite sure of it anyway. In fact at that moment I felt quite happy\nabout her. But Edith replied, '\nNo, it's hopeless,' became very\nupset, completely breaking down and weeping bitterly. I was\nawfully distressed then, feeling there was nothing I could say.\nAnd soon after I woke up. I was so saddened at Edith's distress\nI lit the lamp and read for a while. I didn't note the time, but there\nwas a glimmer of light coming through the curtain. So it was some\ntime in the early morning.\n\" Later I hoped that the dream might mean that Alice had taken\na-turn for the better and that she was going to get well after\nall.\"\nThe above statement was enclosed with a letter from Miss\nCummins to Miss Gibbes written on the evening of 4 August 1932\nas follows :\n\" You will note in the letter I sent you that I said I had a sad\nand vivid dream about Alice. I made a note of it as you will seer <_\nwhich I didn't enclose with the proofs as I was in a hurry to get to\nthe post office in case there was a letter from you by the second\npost with further corrections. I got quite a turn when I opened\nyour letter in the post office and read that poor Alice had died early\non Tuesday morning. I am most terribly sorry, for though I only\nknew her slightly I had a real affection for her, she was such a\ndelightful person.\n\" Do you think my dream was after her passing or was it when\nshe was unconscious ? The strange thing about the dream I had\nwas that I was quite certain she was alive. I made a note of it\nbecause I thought that if you wrote and told me that she had taken\na turn for the better and was going to get well, there would be\nsome truth in the remark she made in the dream that she was\n'\nquite all right.' and in the impression she conveyed that she was\n\fJanuary 1933 .4 Veridical Dream 5\ngoing to be quite well again. What upset me most in the dream was\nEdith's despair.\n*'\nAlso I don't understand why I was so terrified lest Alice should\ntouch me. There was some mark on her forehead, almost like a\nslight cut or breaking of the skin. Otherwise she was as I saw her\nlast except that she was so ghastly pale and looked so ill, yet at the\nsame time she was so cheery, and in this respect such a contrast to\nEdith. Alice gave me such a feeling of happiness after my terror\nhad passed.\"\nA few days after receiving this letter Miss Gibbes wrote to a friend\nof hers, Miss C, asking whether she could obtain from Edith answers\nto a number of questions. These questions and the replies received\nare given below\n:\n1. What was the actual time at which death occurred ?\nAnswer.\u2014To the best of our knowledge A. F. passed on between\n-9 and 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday morning.\n2. At what hour did she become quite unconscious I\nA nswer. \u2014Was never quite unconscious. Came out of the morphia\noccasionally. Presumably sank from 5 a.m.\n3. Is there any room in the home [i.e. the nursing home in which\nA. F. died] or elsewhere connected with Edith with a step leading\ndown to it ?\nAnswer.\u2014The matron's room, where Edith used to interview Dr\nor matron, has a step down to it.\ni. Has Edith said to you and to others\u2014if so. when\u2014\" No, it's\nhopeless\n:\n'\n?\nAnswer.\u2014A much used phrase since January.\n5. Can you explain the mark on the forehead ( 1 mean did\nAlice have an accident at any time which left a scar for a period ?\nAnswer.\u2014She had a scar on the forehead which she always\ncovered.\nOn 28 September 1932 the Hon. Editor. Mrs Salter, had an inter-\nview with Miss Gibbes in which a verbal account of this dream was\ngiven her. Mrs Salter suggested that it would be desirable to\nobtain further information about the scar, and in particular to\nascertain whether knowledge of its existence seemed to be confined\nto a few persons. On 29 September and again on 22 October 1932\nMiss Gibbes wrote to Mrs Salter to the following effect : Knowledge\nof the existence of the scar seems to have been confined to a few\nintimate friends and (presumably) A lice's relatives. The scar, which\nwas very slight, was received in the following circumstances : as a\nsmall child of three or four Alice was driving with her father, who\nwas Commissioner of Police in Ireland. A stone was thrown at\nhim and hit the child instead. Miss Gibbes has known Miss C. for\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt January 1933\na number of years, but has known Edith and Alice about three\nyears only. Miss Cummins has known all three for three years only.\nIn two letters to Miss Gibbes subsequent to the letter of 4 August\nMiss Cummins referred to her impression of the scar as follows :\n\"1. It is certainly remarkable about the scar on the forehead,\nfor I had no knowledge of it and was impressed by the sight of it\nin the dream of Alice's forehead.\n\" 2. One point more re dream. When I saw the scar on Alice's\nforehead during the dream, I thought it must be caused by the ill-\nness from which she was suffering, for she certainly had nothing,\nno mark, when I knew her. That was my dream thought and\nwaking thought, and so I was surprised to read in your first re\ndream that you had heard nothing about a mark or scar. For it\nhad made such a definite impression on my visual sense in the\ndream.\"\nIn view of the fact that at the time of her dream Miss Cummins\nhad some knowledge concerning the unsatisfactory condition of\nAlice's health, a further statement on this point is desirable.\nAbout a week before Christmas 1931 Miss Cummins underwent a\nsevere operation, and after a period of convalescence in England\nshe left for Ireland on 24 May. In a letter to Mrs Salter dated\n3 October 1932 Miss Gibbes writes :\n\" The only time I mentioned\nAlice [to Miss Cummins] between that date [24 May] and her death\nwas in a letter which would have been written about a month after\nMiss Cummins's departure. I only referred to her casually and\ngave no details, merely saying, as far as I can recollect, that Miss C.\nhad been here and that Alice seemed pretty bad. But I avoided\ntelling her that the case was hopeless.\"\nThe point is dealt with again in a letter from Miss Gibbes to Mrs\nSalter on 22 October 1932 :\n\" I quite agree that it would be a good point to state that Miss\nCummins was recovering from a severe operation and that I had\ndeliberately refrained from telling her how serious Alice's condition\nhad become. . . . Alice was also operated on . . . soon after Christ-\nmas. She recovered wonderfully and was out and about soon after-\nwards. Miss Cummins had seen Alice once only last autumn, before\nshe got so ill. and only met her once afterwards at Miss C.'s flat early\nin April last. Alice had been acting in some Sunday play and Miss\nCummins tells me that she so envied her being able to work so soon,\nwhen she [Miss Cummins] was feeling unfit to do anything. The\nlast Miss Cummins heard of Alice before she went to Ireland at the\nend of May. was that she (A.) had developed a bad cough. As I\nsay, I purposely gave Miss Cummins no details of the sudden serious\n\fJanuary 1933 7\ndevelopments . . . except in the one letter to which reference is\nalready made. I did not want to upset her as she was ordered to\nrest as much as possible.\"\nAn announcement of Alice's death on 2 August 1932 appeared in\na London paper of 3 August.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nNotes on Sittings.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014Having read Miss Dallas's letter in the November number\nof your Journal, I thought that the following facts might be found\ninteresting.\nAt a recent sitting with Mrs Leonard, Feda, having given me an\nunmistakable description of a friend, proceeded to spell out her\nsecond Christian name : not that by which she is called ; and\nremarked :\n\" He [the communicator] says it isn't the name you\nwould expect him to know her by.\"\nAt a sitting last April with another medium, the same communi-\ncator alluded to his sister-in-law by her second and more uncommon\nname.\nIs it not possible that these cases are due to an association in the\nmind of the medium with the name given, which would cause it to\nbe more easily brought to the surface ?\nYours, etc.,\nEnid de Kakucs.\nREVIEW.\nBernhard Bavink. The Anatomy of Modern Science, 8vo, pp. xiii.\n683, 87 ill. London : Bell & Sons, Ltd., 1932. Price 21s. net.\nAfter outlines, anatomies. Yet anatomy means for most of us\nstudy of internal structure. Does science grow that way ? Is it\nnot more like a tree which is most alive on the bark, less at the core,\nadvancing by its outer growing edge ? Certainly the chief signifi-\ncance of this book lies in its power of dealing with the latest revolu-\ntionary advances-\u2014one might almost say explosions\u2014of science. In\nform it almost deserves that favourite Teutonic word, colossal. A\nBibliography of some six hundred works, a \" Notary \" of four\nhundred and twenty cross references, comments and additional\nsuggestions back up a survey which sweeps through Force and\nMatter (Part I), Cosmos and Earth (Part II), Matter and Life (Part\nIII), and Nature and Man (Part IV). Who is equal to resurveying\nand checking up such a compass ? To readers of this Journal the\nfinal part, \" Nature and Man,\" will seem the most important, and\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1933\nat least they will not be provincial in so thinking, because the\nauthor shares their opinion, building up the whole vast structure of\nhis knowledge toward that climax, or perhaps it would be a juster\nsimile to say that this is the keystone with which he would lock\nthe gigantic arch which he hopes to throw across the gap which for\nmost explorers yawns between reality and the ideal. For he is an\nidealist and thinks that the time has come when, with the material\nthat is to hand, the bridge may be thrown. Up till now he thinks\nit has only been a rainbow bridge. Now the essential hard facts are\nquarried and are ready to take our weight if we fit them together.\nIn the first three parts we are shown how the old materialism is\nno longer adequate to explain the physical universe that science\nnow apprehends. There is not anything very original in this\npresentation but, to return to the bridge simile, the abutment from\nwhich an arch might be thrown is shown to be far larger and to\noffer far better purchase for the leap than twenty years ago would\nhave seemed possible, and we are also shown that the abutment\ngrows year by year. In consequence Part IV is the critical part of\nthe book. Everything is pointing to a bridge being a possibility if\nonly the stones could be found to build it . With the earliest chapters\nof this part we need not concern ourselves, save to point out that\nwhen discussing eoliths the conclusions could have been more\nsuccinct and definite if the work of Reid Moir, which has now been\naccepted not only here but by prehistorians in France, had been\nquoted. It is strange that our encyclopaedist is ignorant of it.\nThe chapter which matters most of all is the one dealing with\npsychical research. There, he believes, is to be found the material\nwhich shows how science is going to advance to a complete new\nconception of the universe. He divides his evidence into mental\nand physical phenomena. The case is well put and enough is found\nto substantiate the author's opinion, but here, too, the author\nmight have consulted more authorities than he has and found\nbetter evidence. He believes telepathy and clairvoyance .to be\nproved, but takes as his example of the latter The Gate of Remem-\nbrance and its companion volume. The case was, of course, of no\nlittle interest, but many members of the S.P.R., especially those\nwho combine with their taste for psychology one for archaeology,\nwill wish that he had chosen some other examples, say from the\nProceedings. When he comes to the physical phenomena his lack of\nrecords of the latest work done by Osty with Rudi Schneider is\neven more serious, for he feels bound to dismiss this whole side as\nunsubstantiated in any way\u2014a conclusion no one can blame a\nscientist arriving at until Osty's experiments were published.\nStill Dr Bavink owns that if only telepathy is accepted, and he\nfeels that no one who investigates the material now available can\n\fJanuary 1933 Review 9\nreject it, the bridge that will lead into a new world of apprehension\nis thrown, though it be to-day but one brick thick. Dr Bavink\"s\ncontention is that with telepathy we have a link that goes far to\nestablish the \" parapsychism \" of the universe. His argument for\nrejecting the common opinion that telepathy is akin to radio and\nshowing that it points much more validly to some sort of access to\nan underlying field of common consciousness is well put and impor-\ntant and should be studied.\nIn contrast to this part of the book the conclusion is disappoint-\ning. He attempts to sum up how the wise man is to regard the\nworld to-day and gets mixed up in discussions about race\u2014a pecu-\nliarly German danger\u2014and eugenics. His conclusion, too. that\nrevelation comes best through the three great Bs of music may be\ntrue but is not very scientific or original, while his comments on\nthe problem of pain and evil are not much above the average\ntheological level. It seems a pity, after the immense thoroughness\nof the first parts and the originality of the part on psychical research,\nthat the ending should be so tame as to be almost trite. The differ-\nence to life that the new theories about the world and consciousness\nwill make Dr Bavink does not seem to realise. He is still thinking\nin terms of pure science, and when that is over he goes back to the\nold world of politics, of Germany beaten unfairly in the War, of the\nless well-endowed classes outbreeding professors. He does not seem\nto realise that whereas the theories and experiments of a Faraday\nwhich entertained his cultured contemporaries now control and\nshape the lives of us all, so even more the researches to-day done\ninto the faculties of the human mind, though this year a drawing-\nroom amusement may have even more portentous effect on the\nworld to-morrow. It is a conclusion hard to realise, but when\nthought over harder to reject. And as the discovery of electricity\nmade many of the power and traction and lighting problems of the\npre-electric age irrelevant, so the discovery of other faculties and\napprehensions of the human mind, other than we have been able\nto employ up to the present in this civilisation, may make many of\nthe problems which seem so pressing and grave to-day insignificant\nto the next generation.\nGerald Heard.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nRevue Metapsychique, September-October 1932.\nDr E.

Her name and address are given\nabove.\nThe Report of the Council for 1932 was considered and adopted\nas amended.\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1932.\nThe Society's Jubilee. The year 1932 will be memorable in the\nannals of psychical research as that in which our Society celebrated\nits Jubilee. The Council were so fortunate as to persuade Sir\nOliver Lodge to undertake the Presidency during the Jubilee year.\nAlthough in this year the office was particularly onerous, Sir Oliver\nwas unsparing of his own comfort in carrying out the duties involved.\nThe Council also decided that it would be proper to the occasion to\nappoint as President of Honour for the year Mrs Sidgwick, the only\none of our Members who has been closely associated with the\nSociety's work throughout the whole of its existence. Mrs Sidgwick\nhad expressed her desire to relinquish the office of Hon. Secretary\nat the end of the previous year ; nevertheless she continued during\n1932 constantly to give the Society the benefit of her advice and help.\nThe Society completed its 50th year in February, but it was\nthought best to hold the Jubilee celebrations towards the end of\nJune. These took the form of a Council Dinner, followed by a\nReception by the President, to which all Members and Associates\nwere invited. Three public Meetings were also held, at which papers\nby the President, the President of Honour, and Dr William Brown,\nwere read ; these papers have since appeared in Parts 126 and 127\nof Proceedings.\nThe Society also invited to the Dinner and Reception several\nforeign psychical researchers of distinction, but owing to the general\neconomic depression none of them was able to be present in person ;\nbut they sent congratulations and good wishes, which were much\nappreciated.\nThe financial situation. The year has, of course, been one of\ngreat financial anxiety. Towards the end of 1931 the Council\nappointed a special Committee to advise on possible economies, and\nthe report of that Committee, which was accepted by the Council,\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1933\nwas summarized in the Journal for February 1932. As the result of\nthese economies, of several generous donations, and of two small\nlegacies which were received during the year, the Society was\nenabled to carry out its activities without serious hindrance, and its\nfinancial position at the end of the year was sounder than at the\nbeginning. The Council felt that in view of the financial position of\nthe Society it would not be proper that any part of the cost of the\nsocial festivities connected with the Jubilee should fall on the\nSociety's funds, and they are glad to report that the generosity of\nmembers and friends relieved the Society's funds (if any burden op\nthis account.\nStrict economy will be necessary in the immediate future if the\nSociety is to continue its work, and among other economies it may\nunfortunately be necessary to keep the amount of matter published\nin Proceedings somewhat below the average of recent years.\nThe past and the future. As was only natural, the conclusion of\nfifty years' work in psychical research raised in the minds of many\nof our Members and Associates the question whether the time had\nnot come when the Society might make some collective or corporate\nstatement as to the conclusions to be drawn from the work done, in\nparticular with regard to the question of survival and communica-\ntion, which has played such a large part in our studies. The Council\nare of opinion that the Society should continue to adhere to the\npolicy it has pursued since its foundation, that is, to decline to make\nany corporate pronouncement on survival and communication, or\non any of the many other questions which have arisen in the course\nof its researches. In adhering to this policy the Society will be\nfollowing the usual course pursued by learned Societies with regard\nto questions that are in any degree controversial.\nIn addition to this general principle, the Council think that the\nfollowing considerations are also relevant. The Society has from\nthe beginning included many varieties of opinion on the matters\ninvestigated, but on two important points there has been substantial\nagreement, first, that psychical research is a subject to which time,\ntrouble and money, should be devoted, and secondly, that the\nmethods of investigation laid down and followed by the Society are\nthe only sound ones.\nOn other questions, including that of survival, there has always\nbeen difference of opinion, and this is likely to continue as the\nproblems w il li w hich we deal are seen to be more complex the more\nclosely they are studied. The Council would deprecate any course\nwhich might impair the comprehensive character of the Society, or\nalternatively might give an exaggerated view of differences of\nopinion among our members.\nThe absence of a corporate pronouncement on any subject, it\n\fFebruary 1933 Annual Report of the Council for 1932 2]\nneed hardly be said, is due to impartiality and not indifference.\nIndividual members are always free to express their opinions, and\nsuch expressions, when they are the result of long and careful study\nof the problems of psychical research, may prove of great value.\nResearch. (1) Organisation. As announced in the Journal for\nFebruary 1932, Dr V. J. Woolley, then Hon. Research Officer, was\nnot in agreement with some of the recommendations with regard to\neconomy accepted by the Council, and in consequence resigned\nfrom the Society. The Council, considering the situation in the\nlight of recent experience, did not consider it desirable to make any\nimmediate appointment of another Research Officer. The Council\nwish to emphasise the point of view that every member of the\nSociety ought to assist in the work of research so far as his abilities\nand opportunities permit. The function of the Society is to further\nresearch among its members, to collect and coordinate the results,\nand to conduct investigations under its own auspices in cases where\nfor reasons of expense or otherwise individual research does not\nmeet the case. As a matter of historical fact much of the Society's\nmost important research has been done by members not holding\nany official position, but acting on their own initiative and authority.\nTo advise them in questions of research in the immediate future\nthe Council appointed a temporary Committee, consisting of the\nHon. Editor (Mrs Salter), Lord Charles Hope, Admiral the Hon.\nA. C. Strutt, and the Librarian and Editor (Mr Theodore Besterman).\n(2) Spontaneous phenomena. Lord Balfour and Mr Piddington\ninvestigated a case of haunting, which was reported in the Journal\nfor October 1932. Two other cases, one in South Wales and one in\nDevonshire, were investigated by friends of Sir Ernest Bennett,\nwho reported them to the Society. Mr Salter visited a house in\nLincolnshire, said to be haunted ; and Miss Newton a supposed\npoltergeist case in the South of London. Four places, one in London,\none in Shropshire, and two in the Home Counties, were similarly\nvisited by Mr Besterman. One of these inquiries was made in col-\nlaboration with Mr Gerald Heard and another with Lord Charles\nHope. Except for the first mentioned case, none has as yet proved\nof evidential interest. In one case inquiries are to be continued.\n(3) Other research work. In addition to the usual routine work,\nwhich included several sittings with mediums other than those\nspecified below, a number of special investigations were carried out.\nIn July Mr and Mrs Besterman went to Norway to have a series of\nsittings with a lady of mediumistic powers, which she uses non-\nprofessionalb\/, Fru Ingeborg Kober, nee Dahl. Some interesting\nresults were obtained, which were briefly reported in the Journal for\nDecember 1932. It is hoped that the Society may have the oppor-\ntunity of conducting a further investigation into this mediumship.\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1933\nMr Besterman continued his analysis of the records of sittings\nwith Mrs Leonard, with the object of making a comparative study\nof the characteristics of different Communicators. A preliminary\nexamination of the records of about 250 sittings was made during\nthe year. In view of the very large mass of material involved,\namounting to well over six million words, and the limited time\navailable for this work, it is not likely to be concluded for several\nyears. During the year Mr Besterman attended a number of\nsittings with Mrs Leonard with the same inquiry in view. In\nNovember the attempt was made, for the purpose of testing certain\npoints of interest in Mrs Leonard's trance, to record a sitting on\ngramophone records. The Gramophone Company, Ltd., was\nemployed for this purpose, and the attempt was completely success-\nful. An announcement on this subject was made in the Journal for\nJanuary 1933. Unfortunately experiments of this type, which are\nnowadays becoming more and more necessary, are expensive. The\npresent experiment cost the Society just on \u00a3100, of which a third\nwas supplied by special donations from a few members directly\ninterested in the sitting recorded. Even so, it has been possible to\nmake only ten permanent records of the twenty-three obtained at\nthe sitting. This experiment is intended, finance permitting, to be\nonly the first step of an important investigation which should mark\nan appreciable advance in the study of trance mediumship.\nThe experiment in long-distance telepathy between a group in\nAthens and a group meeting in the Society's Rooms was concluded\nand reported on in the Journal for April 1932. The results were\nunfortunately negative.\nMr Besterman organised, with the co-operation of Mr J. W.\nDunne, an inquiry into precognitive dreams. The experiment was\nconducted on a considerable scale with groups of members of the\nSociety and of Oxford undergraduates. A report has been com-\npleted and will, it is hoped, be published early in 1933.\nVarious attempts have been made, particularly in recent years,\nto put on a more solid footing the scoring, or evaluation, of the non-\nstatistical material obtained at sittings with trance mediums. An\nexperiment in this connection has been begun, with several objects\nin view. It is too early to say more at the moment, as the inquiry\nis still running its course.\nMr H. F. Saltmarsh has been engaged for some time past on an\nanalysis of the cases of apparent precognition recorded in our\nProceedings and Journal. This important work has now been com-\npleted, and Mr Saltmarsh has prepared a report which, it is hoped,\nwill soon be published in Proceedings.\nTwo members of the Society, Mr Fred Barlow and Major Rampling\nRose, both gentlemen with expert knowledge of photography, have\n\fFebruary 1933 Annual Report of the Council for 1932 23\nfor some time past been co-operating in the investigation of super-\nnormal photography, and have had a large number of sittings with\nthe best-known \" spirit-photography \" mediums. They have kindly\nkept the officers of the Society informed from time to time of the\nprogress of their researches, the result of which was embodied in a\npaper read to the Society, and shortly to be printed in the Pro-\nceedings. This thorough investigation is an important contribution\nto psychical research.\nAs it was considered important that further research should be\nconducted on the lines of Dr Eugene Osty's experiments with Rudi\nSchneider, a copy of his report was sent to Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S.,\na member of the Society, who was able to make a valuable sug-\ngestion of a fine of research which might throw light on the pheno-\nmena. This suggestion was embodied by Lord Rayleigh in a paper\nwhich will be printed at the beginning of 1933. Apparatus designed\non the fines suggested in Lord Rayleigh' s paper has been employed\nin a series of private sittings with Rudi Schneider arranged by Lord\nCharles Hope and a circle of friends.\nArrangements have also been made between the Society and the\nInstitut Metapsychique of Paris for a collaboration in the further\ninvestigation of Rudi Schneider in the New Year. The Council felt\nthat Dr Osty's methods marked a welcome departure in the in-\nvestigation of paraphysical phenomena and they are glad of the\nopportunity of collaboration with him that has arisen.\nThe Library. The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust's grant having\ncome to an end last year, the Society now earmarks an annual sum\nof \u00a350 for the purposes of the Library. This sum naturally allows\nonly the most necessary works to be added to it. The number of\nbooks and pamphlets in the Library now stands at 7,276, an increase\nof about 170 during the year.\nIn addition to the volumes consulted in the Library, 515 volumes\nwere borrowed by 72 Members. In addition 99 volumes were\nborrowed by the National Central Library. A few books were\nobtained for members from the National Central Library.\nThe Society was again represented by the Society's Librarian at\nthe Annual Conference (at Somerville College, Oxford) of the\nAssociation of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux, to which\nthe Society is affiliated.\nMyers Memorial Lecture. The Council have appointed Dr Osty\nto deliver the Third Frederic W. H. Myers Lecture in October 1933.\nDr Osty is a Corresponding Member of the Society and has a long\nrecord of distinguished work in psychical research. Tfie Council\nregard themselves as fortunate in securing him as Myers Lecturer.\nChanges in the Council. To fill the vacancy caused by Dr Woolley's\nresignation, the Council appointed Mr S. 6.

Lowes Dickinson (formerly a member of\nCouncil), Mrs W. E. Doane, Mr John S. Engall, Dr F. van Eeden\n(an Hon. Associate), Mrs J. B. Gaskell, Dr J. W. Graham, Mr\nCharles R. Johnson, and Miss M. E. Verrall. The total number\nof deaths was eleven Members, ten Associates, and one Hon.\nAssociate.\nMembership of tlie Society. Once again the general financial\ndepression is reflected in a decline in the total number of the Society's\nMembers and Associates, though fortunately the decline is not as\nserious as might have been anticipated, and the number of new\nMembers elected shows a slight increase over last year. During\n1932, 44 Members and 23 Associates resigned, and 15 Members\nand 3 Associates were removed for non-payment of their subscrip-\ntions.\nThe new Members elected number 45, as against 36 last year, and\nthe total membership of the Society, omitting Hon. and Corre-\nsponding Members and Hon. Associates, is now 474 Members and\n275 Associates.\nPublications. Six parts of Proceedings were published during the\nyear : Part 122 in January, Part 123 in April, Part 124 in May,\nPart 125 in June, Part 126 in July and Part 127 in October.\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to\n\u00a392 19s. 10d., an increase of nearly \u00a320 over the previous year. On\nthe other hand, the sales of the Proceedings and Journal to members\nof the Society, at half-price, amounted to \u00a323 16s. 5d., a consider-\nable decrease on last year's sales, due no doubt to the decline in\nthe Society's membership. The returns from the Society's agent\nin America amounted, after deduction of commission, to\n\u00a321 18s. 8d.\nMeetings.

Munich : F.\nBruckmann AG., 1932.\nThe object of this book, as Dr Driesch tells us in his foreword, is\nto offer some guidance to the psychical researcher, first in the\npractical observation of phenomena, and secondly in such theoretical\ndeductions as in the present state of our knowledge may legitimately\nbe made.\nIn his first two sections he discusses the conditions under which\nobservation of spontaneous or experimental phenomena\u2014both\nphysical and psychical\u2014should, as far as possible, be carried out,\nand the various kinds of malobservation or deception against which\nwe have to guard. We may consider it a matter for mutual con-\ngratulation that the methods Dr Driesh enjoins are generally speak-\ning those which this Society has tried to follow. Numerous appre-\nciative references to the Society and its publications will be found\nthroughout his book.\nDr Driesch next seeks to determine which amongst many alleged\nphenomena maybe considered \" basic\", that is phenomena whose\noccurrence and supernormal origin are sufficiently demonstrated to\nbe used as a foundation for scientific theory (p. 57).\nPride of place is here given to telepathy and thought-reading\n(Dr Driesch uses these terms alternatively according as the agent\nor the percipient is to be regarded as the active member in the\npartnership) ;\nin his subsequent theoretical discussion he makes it\nclear that he considers these phenomena of psychic origin and not\nto be accounted for by any hypothetical \" radiation \".\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 19.33\nTo clairvoyance Dr Driesch also assigns a place as a \" basic\n\"\nphenomenon (p. 64), although its occurrence is not so well attested\nas that of telepathy, partly on account of the difficulty of observing\nit under conditions which shall make certain that telepathy has\nbeen excluded. Precognition he leaves an open question, not yet\nsufficiently determined for theoretical discussion, and he doubts\nwhether psychometry can on the present evidence be considered\nclearly distinguishable from telepathy.\nIn his discussion of physical phenomena Dr Driesch agrees with\nother critical observers in finding the present position very un-\nsatisfactory. He draws attention (p. 26) to the great difficulty of\nadequate observation in darkness or in dim red light, and holds\nthat in the case of many alleged phenomena, e.g. \" direct voice\n\"\nand \" apports \", the evidence is unconvincing. He does not admit\nany physical phenomena to be strictly speaking \" basic \" as defined\nabove, but he considers that \" materialisation in association with\nthe body of a paraphysically gifted person \"\n(p. 80) is in a high\ndegree probable. He includes telekinesis in this definition and calls\nespecial attention to Dr Osty's recent experiments with Rudi\nSchneider ;\nexperiments of this kind, he suggests, afford the best\nprospect at present open to us of setting physical phenomena on a\nreally scientific footing.\nIn the theoretical discussion which occupies the second part of\nhis book, Dr Driesch, as might be expected from his work in other\nfields, expresses his firm conviction that a supernormal phenomenon\nsuch as telepathy cannot be explained on any purely physical and\nmaterialistic hypothesis, within the limit of spatial terms ; since\nthe phenomenon occurs, we must go \" beyond space \" into \" the\nunknown medium of communication \" ; this medium of com-\nmunication we shall not find in simple \" animism \", we must admit\nsome power in the soul of operating beyond the limits of the body.\nHaving made this admission, two further lines of advance are open\nto us : one towards a theory of \" world-consciousness \", the other\ntowards the spiritistic hypothesis, and as between these two solu-\ntions Dr Driesch inclines to the second.\nIn view of the author's long-established reputation it would be\nsuperfluous and impertinent to praise the scientific moderation with\nwhich he sets out his case. Let us hope his book may do something\nto overcome what Dr Driesch describes as the \" inexcusable\n\"\nnegligence of official science \" besonders in Deutchland \".\nH. de G.

Salter in the Chair.\nMr Fred Barlow and Major Rampling Rose read a paper\non \" Supernormal Photography \", which is published in Part 129\nof Proceedings.\nMr Besterman said that most students of the subject would\nagree that the paper they had just listened to had removed what\nlingering doubts some of them might have had left as to the fraudulent\nnature of spirit-photography. He felt that the only argument\nthat remained for the genuineness of the phenomena lay in the\nrecognition by relatives of the extras appearing on those photo-\ngraphs. He emphasised that such recognition was to all intents\nand purposes valueless, and illustrated this by describing the\ncases of the spirit-photographers Buguet and the Falconer brothers.\nThese two cases, one in France in 1875, the other in South Africa\nin 1931, showed conclusively that people had recognised extras\nwhere there was no shadow of doubt that these extras had been\nfraudulently produced, and that they continued to recognise\nthem even when the exact process of the fraud was laid bare. He\ndesired particularly to congratulate Mr Barlow on the courage\nhe had shown in coming forward in the way he had done, to explain\ncalmly and dispassionately that his previous convictions as to the\ngenuineness of spirit-photography had been mistaken.\n\fMarch 1933 Private Meetings 35\nDr Dingwall said that he wanted a sworn statement from the\nfriend of Mr Barlow's who had made the incriminating discovery\nin Hope's bag. He asked how it was that no-one had searched\nHope in order to find the flashlight . He thought that the evidence\nfor the genuineness of Mrs Deane's spirit-photographs was too\ncontemptible to be discussed.\nMrs De Crespigny said that she was in a position to confirm\nMr Barlow's statement about his friend's discovery, and she felt\nthat she ought to do so. She suggested that if physical phenomena\nbore certain aspects characteristic of the medium it was because\nthose phenomena were produced through the medium. She was\nsatisfied that Hope had produced genuine spirit-photographs.\nMr Marriott gave an account of various methods of fraud in\nproducing spirit-photographs. It was only astonishing that\nmediums were so stupid that they employed the crude methods\nthey did. He had been investigating this subject for a large\nnumber of years, and he was quite clear that every spirit-photograph\nhe had seen was unquestionably fraudulent.\nMr Feilding, Mr Hettinger and Mr Batehelor also took part in the\ndiscussion, to which Mr Barlow and Major Rose replied.\nPrecognittve Phenomena.\nThe 119th Private Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday,\n4 January 1933, at 3.30 p.m., Sir Lawrence Jones.

It is\nhoped to print both these papers in Proceedings.\nA short discussion followed, in which Mr Lauwerys, the Rev.

B. Rhine.\nDepartment of Psychology. Duke University.\nThis most important question has been very interestingly treated\nin the article by Mr Saltmarsh published in the Proceedings of your\nsociety (xl. 105 ff.), and in the discussion between Mr Saltmarsh\nand Sir Oliver Lodge which follows. I find myself largely in\nagreement with the critical evaluation there given of the alternate\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1933\nhypotheses and of the various types of evidence considered, as far\nas they are taken up. But I believe that some further pointing up\nof the question may be achieved by giving attention to certain\nspecial evidential possibilities not included in the article referred to.\nThat is, there are types of evidence which appear to me to discrimi-\nnate more sharply between the survival hypothesis and the present\nalternate hypotheses, than do those mentioned by Mr Saltmarsh.\nIf I am correct, such types would, of course, offer better assurance\nof survival and would bring the whole question to a more definite\nfocus.\nI shall continue on the working assumption of Mr Saltmarsh, that\neach type of evidence has been represented by an actual occurrence,\nsince this keeps the discussion on the same logical level.\nThe types of evidence to which I refer as offering superior proof-\nvalue to the survival theory are those which clearly show purposes\nthat are appropriate only to one individual, the supposed spirit\nidentified. The point in mind is that peculiar motivation is more\nidentificative of the \" agency \" involved than are data from the\npast life of the individual concerned, facts describing his personality,\nor physical manifestations claimed to be due to his efforts. I do\nnot mean merely that a show of appropriate motives has better\ndescriptive and identification value, though I do think this is so. The\ncase is more complex : I mean that we may take into account the\ncausation of these psychical occurrences, and we have to look for\nthis in terms of motives or purposes. If there are cases in which\nthese purposes cannot plausibly be ascribed to any of the living\nor the dead except the \" spirit \" identified, I believe we have a\nstronger type of evidence for survival than those reviewed in the\narticle mentioned above. Evidence of the peculiarity of motive,\nof its restriction to the particular individual identified, goes farthest,\nI think, to indicate the responsibility for psychical causation,\n\u2014\ni.e.\nfor the agency of the process.\nThis evidence of purpose peculiar to a given \" spirit \" has to be\nsuperimposed upon a basis of identifying information, which may\nconsist of facts drawn from the memory, personality traits, and\npossibly physical occurrences. Such identifying material docs not.\nas Mr Saltmarsh well points out, escape the explanatory reach of\nalternate hypotheses. A sensitive alone might conceivably assemble,\nthese facts. They serve merely to identify a deceased individual\nwho might be considered as the \" candidate \". Definite agency\nmust then be proved before the \" candidate \" can properly be\nregarded as a surviving \" spirit \". The function of proving this\nappears to me to lie with that evidence that shows the purposive\ncausation involved to be appropriate to the * candidate \", and of\nall persons, to him alone.\n\fMarch 1933 The Possibility of Proving Survival :!7\nThe best type of this general sort would be one in which a deceased\nindividual communicated a message pertaining to a situation in\ncurrent affairs in which he alone of all persons living or dead would\nbe expected to be actively concerned, but which would be of great\nsignificance to him. This message should come unsought and\nunexpected, and preferably, should be an intrusion into the com-\nmunication stream of another communicator. If, then, it is a\nmessage that is truly unexpected to those receiving or delivering\nit, and yet is clearly appropriate and evidential with respect to the\nsupposed spirit who is identified with it, it appears difficult to find\na plausible source for the purpose shown other than in a surviving\npersonality itself. It requires, of course, a basis of evidence of\nmere fact which will establish supernormality first and identify the\npersonality as well. Then upon this basis, if the purpose revealed\nis appropriate and peculiar to the identified individual, is one that\nhas arisen since death, and is not appropriate to the state of mind\nof anyone among the living, it makes a relatively strong case for\nthe agency of the person identified.\nLet us suppose the following case in order to illustrate the type\nmore specifically. A woman, whose husband has died, and who has\nnever gone to a medium, receives a message purporting to be from\nher dead husband telling her to go to a physician, and specifying\nthat something is wrong with her breast on the right side. The\nmessage does not come directly to the wife, but comes in the course\nof a sitting which a friend is having with a sensitive, under good\n\u2022conditions of precaution, and represents an interruption to the\ncommunication which the sitter has been receiving and of course\ndesires to have continue. The invading communicator, however,\nseems urgent and, after \" taking control \" and identifying himself\nadequately, asks that the message be passed on to his wife. Now,\nno one else knows of any trouble such as this in the woman's health,\nand she does not, herself, know of it. There is, therefore, no\nreason for anyone living to express the purpose shown in the\nmessage\u2014no one has the knowledge essential to forming such a\nmotive. The interest and expectation both of the medium and\nthe sitter are directed toward the affairs of the sitter. The message\nthat is forced through is foreign and could hardly be supposed to\nbe motivated by them. And the wife finds, after consultation with\nthe physician, that she has an incipient tumour in the place indi-\ncated, which later becomes a menace to her health.\nIn the illustration given we may well suppose that it is possible\nfor the sensitive to obtain clairvoyantly such information regarding\nthe health of this woman living, and in other extra-sensory ways to\ncognize the appropriate facts relating to her dead husband. We\nmay even allow that he might be taken by the medium as a supposed\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1933\nsource of the message merely as a matter of technique, or as a simple\nmatter of traditional belief on her part. But we cannot thus\naccount for the motive that thrusts this message in as a disturbance\nto the medium's regular work and best interest. Causation is as\nimportant in mental process as it is in the known physical processes,\nand we have here a definite set of conditions in which the living\nagencies are pretty clearly incapable of a purpose adequate to\nexplain it, as far as our knowledge goes.\nThis type can also occur quite as evidentially under spontaneous\nor semi-spontaneous circumstances. Suppose an individual to\nhave a dream or waking hallucination in which she experiences the\npresence of a man she does not know, but who is clearly identifiable\nlater, from her description. The person who thus appears is\nmuch agitated and begs that someone be sent to his cottage to\nrescue his dog companion that has been left to starve by the master's\ndeath. No one has yet learned of the man's sudden death. The\nsensitive individual who has the spontaneous psychical experience\nhad not acquaintance with the situation concerned, but feels an\nunusual urge to carry out the request. This type of case does, if\nit is adequately veridical, reveal a purpose that is not only most\nappropriate to the man who purports to communicate the message,\nbut is, we may almost say, peculiar to him. Again it is true that\nmere extra-sensory cognition of the clairvoyant and telepathic\nvarieties might supply the facts, but can it supply the causally,\neffective motive or purpose ? To suppose that this hungry dog is,\nin itself, enough to evoke a supernormal experience in the distant\nsleeping individual, is simply to make equally eligible \" potential\nagents \" of all the thousands of hungry or mistreated dogs, cats,\nand other pet animals around the globe. Rather would the mind\nturn to the more plausible supposition, that the mind of the dead\nowner of the dog is in some way still active and is naturally con-\ncerned to help his living companion out of his suffering. If the\nman died suddenly, the argument from the chain hypothesis, that\nhe may have anticipated his dog's predicament while still alive and\nhave telepathically communicated the appeal to someone else, who\nre-transmitted it to the later percipient, is not tenable. Rather,\nwe have here a post-mortem purpose, and one that is also clearly\nan intrusion into the purposive system of another. This would\nappear to me as highly evidential of the agency of surviving per-\nsonality.\nSuch a case might well be semi-spontaneous, also, and arise in the\ncasual performance of the Ouija-board or in incidental efforts at\nautomatic writing. When the feature of unanticipated intrusion is\nclear, and the peculiar appropriateness of the motive to the one\nindividual identified is established, I believe we have the telepathic\n\fMarch 1933 The Possibility of Proving Survival\nand clairvoyant theories pretty plausibly excluded in favour of a\nsurvival theory. One can, of course, always cook up a hypothesis\nof supernormal deception, in which purposes might be concocted\nby a malicious or trick-loving spirit agent of some sort. But if one\nhas to deal seriously with such strange and remote alternatives, no\nscientific conclusion can as yet be taken as established.\nAnother type of evidence of peculiar purposiveness might be\nadded which, I believe, goes beyond the types considered by Mr\nSaltmarsh. It can best be given by illustration : A close friend\nof a family dies suddenly and for some time thereafter there are\napparitions of him witnessed independently by different surviving\nmembers of the household. Most noteworthy are the unmistakable\nsigns that the very young children and even the dog, recognize the\nfamiliar figure of the apparitional friend. Now, after a time mutual\nconfession reveals that the \" haunting \" has been witnessed hy\nseveral members, and one of the parents decides to consult an\nauthority about it. This resolve is kept entirely secret. The\nconsulted authority suggests a visit to a good sensitive, and with\nproper precautions this member of the family holds a sitting with\nher. Through the medium, who has no normally acquired know-\nledge of the home situation, there purports to converse the friend\nwhose apparition has been frequently seen. He confesses that he\nhas been much in the home lately, and explains that he is drawn\nand held by love for the family. He expresses especially his love\nfor the little daughter who had most appealed to him in life. But\nwhen he is told that it is not good for the children, he at once\nagrees to leave. Now, although the children know nothing about\nthe sitting or its results, the apparitions cease from that time on.\nAll the family-members, except the parent who attended the\nsitting, are likewise kept in strict ignorance ;\nyet the apparitions\ncome no more. A year later the parent goes again to the medium\nand again converses with the supposed spirit of the friend. The\nlatter refers to the earlier disturbances and gives assurance that\nthe restraint has been wholesome to him as well, and that there is\nno further danger of disturbance through him.\nThe salient features of this type of case are : Assuming that the\nexperiences of the family were not brought on as a consequence of\ngrief and auto-suggestion (easy to suppose for the children and\ndog), but were effects that call for an external source of activation ;\nand assuming that the parent did not want his children to be thus\nmolested, but was sincere in his effort to rid the home of this dis-\nturbance (also rather easy to suppose in a sane parent), we have a\nfairly plausible picture of agency characterized by the strong\npurpose of the friend to satisfy his sentiment of love for the little\ngirl and her family, both in motivating his apparitional \" return \",\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1933\nand later in motivating his departure. The entire series of events\nand their purposive explanation fit well around the friend whose\napparition was recognized. He, and he alone, could be expected\nto have the purposes leading up to such a chain of happenings.\n(That is, not considering demon-tricksters, insane parents, and\nother fanciful additions to the already ramifying and attenuated\ntelepathy-clairvoyance-subconscious-\" latent memory \" hypothesis.)\nThe type of evidence just described might be given a sub-type by\nhaving the apparitions occur to unsuspecting strangers. Suppose\nthat a woman dies who was deeply attached to her house and a\ncollection of beautiful furnishings. These she has bequeathed to\na relative, with the wish that they be kept under certain conditions\nspecified. Some time after her death the house and its contents\nare sold and a purchaser moves in who is entirely strange to the\nsituation and who knows nothing of the former owner. Then an\napparition of an old woman begins to disturb the household,\nincluding different members of the family, servants, and visitors.\nA medium is quietly brought to the house, without being informed\nof the purpose or the past events. The former owner purports\nto communicate, identifies herself, and protests against the violation\nof her trust. She is informed that the present occupants are being\nmade to suffer, without being in any way guilty, and is prayed\nfor her own good to harbour no resentment even toward the erring\nrelative. After a period of exhortation and explanation the\n\" ghost \" consents to be \" laid \", and the disturbances cease from\nthe point on. Subsequent investigation reveals that the facts given\nwere true, and also that the relative who had sold the house had\nnot given much thought to the whimsical and impractical aspect of\nher bequest, and had had no serious concern or remorse whatever\nover the sale of the house.\nIn this type of case the purpose is specific and peculiar enough\nto satisfy us. A question arises as to whether the old lady might\nnot have produced thoughts of a threatening type before she died,\nand through the chain-process these might not later circulate around\nto the occupants. But if she had fears for her plans, she would\nhardly have left them as she did. If she died suddenly, unprepared\nas to her plans, the chain-hypothesis is not adequate. If we raise\nthe question as to whether her beloved objects might not themselves\nhave stored up a charge of her presence which they could emanate\noff through time in the form of subjective reproductions of the\noriginal woman, we must remember that the mediumistic experi-\nment put a stop to them, rather as if they were a personality,\ninstead of continuously acting physical emanations. One can go\non to suppose that the medium helped the occupants, through\nsuggestion to stop sensing the emanations, even though the latter\n\fMarch 1933 The Possibility of Proving Survival 41\nmay have continued. However, this still does not explain the\ncomplete cessation of the apparitions, to servants and visitors who\ndo not know of the medium's visit. Let us spare ourselves further\ncomminution of these fine points ! To me this sub-type would do\nmuch to assure the agency and hence the survival of the \" candidate\n;\n'.\nStill a further addition, making another sub-type, would be the\ninclusion of some clear-cut physical phenomena, recorded from\nthe witnessing of more than one person. The opening of latched\ndoors which have no defect, the movement of objects, and other\nsuch material changes, would come in this class. (Even the ex-\nperiencing of sounds, odours, and sights by a number of persons at\nonce, presses hard upon our credence to be ranked as \" physical\n\"\nall the more since the word is becoming so hard to define in view\nof modern theory.) In this sub-type we would get further beyond\nthe extra-sensory cognition theories, and require more definite\nagency. That is, it appears still more difficult to suppose the\n\" emanations \" from the treasures of the old lady are capable of\nopening doors and jerking pictures off their hooks, or to suppose\nthat the absent relative, who has sold the house and has more\nor less forgotten about it, is actually in some unknown way moving\nboxes about the attic several miles distant from him. In fact, in\nthe face of such suppositions as to the manner of telekinetic causa-\ntion the hypothesis of \" spirit causation \" would be preferable to\nmost of us in the present state of the facts upon which the different\nhypotheses are based.\nUnfortunately, the most common purpose of the supposed spirits,\nthat of bringing reassurance of continued existence and happiness,\nis close to what we might suppose would be the medium's own\nprofessional purpose to be of great proof-value. The mere will-to-\ncommunicate is hard to separate evidentially from the will-to-please\non the part of the sensitive, even the non-commercial one. Also,\nthis desire of the medium is too much in accord with the desire for\nmessages on the part of the living, for its use in distinguishing\nbetween spirit and non-spirit theories. Thus we cannot draw\nupon the most widespread motivating factors that we find and we\nhave to seek for the special and unexpected purposes, which are\npeculiar to one deceased individual\u2014such purposes as these illustra-\ntions given above have instanced.\nBut there is at least one more type of case worthy of mention,\nwhich would afford high verification-value to the spirit hypothesis\nif established ;\nand again the basis is peculiarity of purpose. But\nin this we are dealing with the design or plan-aspect of purpose,\nrather than the motive,\u2014a type in which the design that the motive\ntakes on is not attributable to any but to the supposed communi-\ncator.\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1933\nI refer now to a complex but unitary procedure in which there is\na promise or intention expressed clearly through a sensitive by a\nsupposed spirit personality, referring to a forthcoming event of a\nphysical character which is presumably to be caused by the spirit\nindividual. This physical event is then referred to later by the\nsupposed spirit through another sensitive and the agency in its\nproduction laid claim to. (If the *'\nphysical event \" consists of a\nsensory experience shared by a number of individuals who were not\nanticipating it, at once, I think we should have to accept it as\nphysical without requiring that it leave \" objectively \" enduring\ntraces. But for most critics the latter criterion of the \" physical\n\"\nwould be preferable.)\nSuppose, as an illustration, that a sitter's principal communicator\nhas been adequately identified, and has shown definite awareness\nof his current affairs. Now comes the statement that the com-\nmunicator intends to being about some event, physical in nature,\nand of peculiar importance to their joint relation. For example :\nthat the clock would be stopped on the anniversary of the com-\nmunicator's death, at the minute and hour of that event. Later\non, through another sensitive the communicator refers to the\ncircumstance, claiming credit for the causation of the event, and\nrefers to the earlier promise. The whole series is repeated with\naltered circumstances but with similar outline.\nThe design shown in this series of related occurrences was not\nthat of the sitter or of his friends, since it had not previously taken\nshape in their minds. And to suppose that the series was designed\nby one or both of the sensitives is to suppose also that they are\nable telekinetically to carry out the physical performance at a\ndistance of miles from the scene. It is probable that to suppose\nsuch capacity resident in the sensitive herself is no harder for many\nof us than to suppose it to be a function of the spirit world. But\ngranting both as conceivable possibilities, the design as a whole\nwould be appropriate to the spirit comnnmicator's interest in proving\nher survival and continued happiness, and would suggest intelligent\nagency,\u2014all of primary importance to her. On the other hand,\nthe design as a whole is inappropriate and far-fetched to the sensitive\nwho without spirit intervention possesses such powers as this. It\nwould be an uneconomical way of practising her gifts, a wasteful\nmanner of exerting her influence, and a perilous fashion of gaining\nfame from her powers, since it assumes deception. Such a strange\nmasking of her real gifts\u2014if they be hers in her own right\u2014under\nthe play-acting of spirit communication should hardly appeal as\nit does to all such sensitives, however eccentric we may suppose the\nprofession to be. Wealth and power coiild be gained in a score\nof better ways with such abilities. The multiplication of such\n\fMarch 1933 The PossibUitji of Proving Survival 4:;\nexamples, then, say to the number of the good book-tests thus\nfar reported, would strain one's doubts to the breaking point and\noffer proof-value of considerable weight. The inappropriateness\nto the living of such designs, and their appropriateness to the\nsupposed communicator associated with them, again presents a\nstrong discrimination in favour of the spirit hypothesis.\nI am disposed to think that a more persistent attack upon the\n\" purposive possibilities \" might offer a still larger range of types\nof evidence that surpass in verification-value those surveyed by\nMr Saltmarsh. At any rate I submit these few as material for\nconsideration and debate. It is very probable that others may\nfind weaknesses in the types proposed of which I am not yet aware.\nSome of these I may be able to patch up and some perhaps not . But\nI feel that the importance of this stage of the scientific method in\nPsychical Research is becoming especially great in view of the fast\naccumulating evidence seeming to bear upon the hypothesis of\nsurvival, and in view of the introduction of new types of evidence.\nIt would appear that definite logical criteria are wanting in the\nminds of most, and many just allow themselves to grow, or totter,\nor drift into convictions pro or con.\nOf most value, perhaps, would be the directive aid such sugges-\ntions might give to the experimenters themselves ;\nsuggestions,\nfor instance, that appear to be in harmony with the general types of\nphenomena occurring, yet which add features that enormously\nincrease the proof-value. And (if we may assume the spirit theory\nfor the moment) we might be able to furnish suggestions of value\nto the \" communicating minds \" themselves, especially since a\nconsiderable share in the burden of invention of improvements has\nbeen claimed by supposed communicators. Furthermore, the\nlogical establishment of the verification value of various types of\nevidence will serve not only to guide one in his degree of acceptance,\nbut will help perhaps, by furnishing standard values of evidence, to\nfree him from the uncomfortable criticism of those who believe a\nlittle more or a little less than he. And such logical relations as\nwe can thus establish will help decidedly to elevate and coordinate\nthe hypotheses and the evidence into a higher and more systematic\nscience.\nI shall not go far to anticipate objections that may be raised to\nthe proof-value of these types, since such conjectures can easily be\ncarried too far. Certain general objections, however, ought to be\nconsidered briefly. For example, some people may not be willing\nto assume that such cases as those described may be expected to\noccur in reality. To this I will say that the elements of these\nsupposed cases have been reported by serious witnesses, and in the\nmain are common psychic occurrences. The special arrangements\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt March 1933\nsuggested would not appear to offer insurmountable difficulty to\nthe agencies at work, so far as we can judge. There have even been\nclose approximations to these types among the reported cases ;\nand,\nit may be well to add, among the more respectable psychic literature.\nPerhaps the most common objection is likely to be, that purposes,\ntoo, can be \" faked \" or \" acted \". This we have in part met already\nin the statement of the suppositional cases. This point is granted to\nthe extent that, where a plausible purpose can be found for \" faking\n\"\na purpose, the purpose in question could not be used as evidence.\nOnly those purposes which apparently would not fit into any other\npersonality setting or motivational picture than that of the identified\n\" communicator \", would be given weight. It is upon such cases\nof purpose, definitely shown, that the above recommendations are\noffered\u2014cases, we may say, in which the \" purpose-to-fake-the-\npurpose \" seems to be wanting.\nAnother question we should expect pertains to the large responsi-\nbility apparently placed upon the supposed communicator's side\nof the relationship. The feature of spontaneity (from the observer's\nviewpoint) in the phenomena, that of intrusion into the normal\npurposive setting of another, of planning beyond the expectations\nand the knowledge of the living, and the like, all put the burden of\nactive agency upon the communicating forces, if there are such.\nThe answer to this is in two parts : First, it is upon that side of the\nproblem that we need to have the responsibility placed in order to\nget. if possible, the evidence of independent agency that is crucial\nto decision. And second, there have been frequent claims of such\nagency by the \" communicating \" side, and a strong appearance\nof a \" will to devise newer and better ways \" of settling the question.\nOn the assumption of the spirit theory, then, these proposals could\nonly be helpful suggestions to the communicators for the improve-\nment of their technique. It is entirely conceivable that such\nco-operation in the logical consideration might be very important.\nThe purposive aspect of psychical evidence bearing on the question\nof survival has already received considerable attention, and has\nplayed an even greater role than we realize perhaps. The sitter or\ninvestigator is more struck, I believe, by the thought, That is just\nwhat X. would have done (or said) !\n\", than by anything else in the\nevidential scale. The evidence for the purpose (or \" will \") to\ncommunicate has been made much of. The question of the purpose\ninvolved in the assembling and organizing of facts that come from\nthe medium's trance has been uppermost in the minds of many.\nBut it is worth while, I feel, to go further, and to plan definitely\naround the purposive aspect just what we can make out of it in the\nway of more clear-cut verification of what is for many \" the Great\nHypothesis \".\n\fMarch 1933 Correspondence 45\nJust as Professor William McDougall has said that there is nothing\nmore fundamental to mind in general than its purposive character,\nso also I think it might be said almost as a corollary, that nothing is\nmore indicative of a particular mind or personality than the peculiar\npurposes or motives that are known to be characteristic of it. And\nwe might point to the great part which \" motives \" play in the\nthinking of those who deal with the various angles of crime, as a\npractical illustration of this importance of purpose in identifying the\nagency involved in a situation. The good detective commonly\nfollows a thread of purpose or motives through his maze of facts.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nSPIRIT-PHOTOGRAPHY.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014With reference to Messrs Rose and Barlow's very complete\nexposure of the fraudulent methods of certain mediums who\nspecialise in \" spirit-photography \", are there not other considera-\ntions which, prima facie, would seem definitely to preclude the\npossibility of any genuine \" spirit-photography \" at all\u2014at least\nwhen the experiment is made using the ordinary commercial dry-\nplates and camera lenses ?\nThe spirit \" image that is registered on the plate and developed\nat the same time and with the same chemicals as the normal image\nmust have registered itself through the energy of light waves\nbrought to a focus on the plane of the plate by the same lens that\nhas correlated the light waves forming the normal image. To\nsuppose otherwise\u2014to take refuge in the vague term\n'\n' supernormal\nwithout analysing the conditions at all\u2014is to make the whole use\nof camera, lens and plate sensitized with silver bromide, simply\nnonsense. If the \" spirits \" do not really use these things why\nbother with the paraphernalia at all ?\nBut the \" spirit image \" light waves do not affect normal vision\n\u2014otherwise they would register on the retinas of the eyes of the\nobservers just as surely as they register on the photographic plate,\nand the \" spirits \" would be seen. That is, the \" spirit \" light\nwaves must be outside the visible spectrum. Now they cannot\nbe of longer wave-length (infra-red) for, unless specially treated,\nphotographic plates are insensitive to them. They must therefore\nbe of shorter wave-length, i.e. ultra-violet.\nNow the crown glass used in part of the components of the\nordinary photographic lens is opaque to ultra-violet radiation.\nThere is a definite cut-off quite close to the edge of the visible\n\f4G Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1933\nspectrum. The flint glass portion of the lens extends the cut-off\npoint a little further in the ultra-violet direction, but the lens as a\nwhole would not, I believe, pass any appreciable portion of the\nultra-violet radiation. How does the \" spirit \" image, therefore,\ncome to a focus on the plate at all ? To all intents and purposes\nthe lens is never \" uncapped \" for ultra-violet rays.\nThere is also another point. In some of the photographs pub-\nlished by Messrs Rose and Barlow the \" spirit \" image is commendably\nsharply focussed. Even the stipple marks of the half-tone blocks\n\" imitated \" by the spirits are clearly to be seen. The normal\nimage on the same plate is also sharply focussed. But ultra-violet\nrays, presuming they could pass through the same lens would focus\nat quite a different plane compared with the rays of the visible\nspectrum. That is. the two images, normal and \" spirit \" could\nnot both be sharply defined in the same photograph, unless, of\ncourse, the \"spirit\" possessed information of the characteristics of\nthe lens used and a sufficient knowledge of optics to enable him to\ncalculate the right distance at which he must manifest himself from\nthe camera in order to correct the focal distortion. Perhaps that\nis why so many of the \" spirit \" photographs are fuzzy\u2014such\n\" spirits \" simply do not appreciate the necessity of hovering\nconsiderably nearer to the lens than they do in order to compensate\nfor the different wave-length of their reflection.\nYours, etc.,\nG. W. Fisk.\nTHE \" ARTHUR GRAHAM \"\"\nCASE.\nT<> the Editor u\/The Jouhnai,.\nSir, \u2014On pages 239, 240 of a book called The Truth about Spiritual-\nism by Mr Bechhofer Roberts, there appears an account of evidence\nof \" spirit communication from the dead \" received through Mrs\nDowden and sent to the S.P.R. in March 1932. Mr Roberts writes\nof this evidence, \" Excellent, convincing, even unanswerable as\nthis case appears at first sight to be, its value as evidence suffers\nfrom a- fundamental defect, which it shares with every other such\ncase : it is published without the slightest corroborative evidence \".\nI took down word for word the entire sitting at which this\nevidence was given through Mrs Dowden at the ouija board. It\nwas a very private matter of great concern to important people\nand the information gained at this meeting was accepted and\nverified by the lawyers and afterwards used in this most important\nlaw case.\n\fMarch 1933 Correspondence 47\nI am not in a position myself to give the names of the parties\nconcerned as I promised to consider the matter as entirely confi-\ndential. But if Mr Roberts is still unable to accept the evidence\nfurnished in this case he should apply to Mrs Dowden herself.\nYours, etc..\nMarion Dawson.\n[We gladly print the above letter, which has reached us through\nMiss\" Cummins, though we of course take no responsibility for Mr\nRoberts's book. Mr Roberts's account of this case is based, he\ninforms us, on Miss Gibbes's letter in the Journal for March 1932\n(xxvii. 223-4) and on the editorial note to that letter. The editorial\nnote stated that \" it has unfortunately proved impossible to obtain\ncorroborative details of the above case \", and was written after\nunsuccessful inquiries had been addressed both to Miss Dawson\nand to Mrs Dowden. Miss Dawson's present letter merely advances\nthe case to the extent that it is now known that she was herself\npresent at the sitting in question. Ed.]\nREVIEWS.\nP. Thomas Bret.

He has a section on dream-psychology\nin which he shows himself to be in the main a follower of Freud, but\nwith certain reservations ; he thinks Freud mistaken, for instance,\nin turning his back so completely on hvpnotism, to which Dr Bret\nattributes considerable curative importance. Another section is\ndevoted to a discussion of the various types of secondary personality.\nAs he has already shown in the earlier sections of his work (see\nreview in Journ. S.P.R., xxvii. 225-6). Dr Bret is a firm believer in\nectoplasmic phenomena ; on p. 62 ff. he discusses the theoretical\nimplications of \" complete materialisations\n;\n'\nof the human form.\nTo some of his readers it will appear that he has fallen into the\nmistake of seeking to explain a supposed event before establishing\nits occurrence.

The style also is diffuse, vague and over-loaded. The\nauthor's convictions lead him to minimise and even neglect adverse\nevidence : Hope, the spirit-photographer, and Eva C, for example,\nare \" nothing blown upon \" in his account. A few extracts bearing\non these criticisms are taken at random :\n\" theoretically everyone\nis more or less psychic \"\n(p. 107), \" such phenomena appear to be\nmore or less common \"\n(p. 36), \" in many cases the [phantasm] is\nseen to open doors, lift curtains, etc., so we may assume that a real\nphantom exists \"\n(p. 55), their objectivity is also proved by photo-\ngraphs which have been taken of them (p. 64),\n\" it is now thought\nthat both magnets and crystals give off noticeable auras \"\n(p. 92),\n'\n' various magnetic centres in the human body have been shewn to\nexist \"\n(p. 113).\nThe whole subject is covered, but not with \" proportional repre-\nsentation \" ; the human aura has two and a half pages, cross-\ncorrespondences and classical knowledge tests one page together,\noriental magic one page, physical phenomena 23 pages of de-\nscription. Sir W. Crookes's experiences with Home are interestingly\nset out, and the chapter on mediumship is well-balanced and the\nbest in the book.

Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E., in the Chair.\nThe following Members were present : Mrs Ball, Mr Theodore\nBesterman, Mrs Theodore Besterman. Miss Carruthers, Dr E. J.\nDingwall, Mr J. W. Findlater, Mr G. W. Fisk, Mrs Goldney, Miss\nIsabel Newton, Mr W. H. Salter, Mrs W. H. Salter, Mr W. S.\nMontgomery Smith, Mr S. G. Soal, Admiral the Hon. A. C. Strutt,\nMiss Nea Walker, and Miss Margaret Wallace.\nThe Secretary having read the notice convening the Meeting,\nMr Salter referred to the delayed circulation of the February Journal\ncontaining the Report of the Council, which it was hoped would\nhave reached Members at least a week before the Annual General\nMeeting. He explained that the delay had been caused by dis-\nlocation of work owing to the prevalence of influenza at the printers.\nAs some Members who were present had not received the Report,\nMr Salter read the greater part of it, omitting only the paragraphs\nrelating to the routine work of the Society.\nReferring to the accounts for 1932 Mr Salter pointed out that\nthe Society started the year with a nominal balance of \u00a329 and\nended it with an actual balance of \u00a364. It was necessary, however,\nto look beyond these figures. The balance at the beginning of\nthe year was only a nominal one, as the Society had overdrawn\nits Bank account to the extent of \u00a3111 and had borrowed, in\naddition. \u00a360 from the Endowment Fund. Instead therefore of a real\nbalance of \u00a329 the Society started the year with a deficit of \u00a3142.\nTo have wiped off this deficit and ended the year with a surplus\nwould in a year like 1932 have been almost a miracle ; it could not\nhave been done if the Society had not during the year received\nand used as income two legacies amounting to \u00a3337. In the par-\nticular circumstances of 1932 the Council were well advised not to\nattempt to place any part of these legacies to capital.\nLooking to the future. Members might hopefully observe that\nsome of the expenses of 1932 were of a non-recurrent kind. Mr\nSalter dealt in some detail with the Society's financial relations\nwith Mrs Piper, and mentioned that under arrangements recently\nconcluded, part of the Piper Trust Funds had, at Mrs Piper's request,\nbeen transferred to her, while the Society was no longer under the\nobligation of making her any annual Grant. Before the new arrange-\nment took effect Mrs Piper had received during 1932 a sum of \u00a352\nfrom the Society's funds which the Society would not have to pay\nagain in the future. The Society had always recognised the great\n\fApril 1933 Annual General Meeting 51\nservices which Mrs Piper had rendered to psychical research, and\nthe Council were very glad to fall in with her wishes as regards the\ntransference of the Trust Funds.\nIt would be seen then that while the Society applied legacies\namounting to \u00a3337 as income, it at the same time converted a debt\nof \u00a3142 into a balance of \u00a364, and made a non-recurrent payment\nof \u00a352. This must in all the circumstances be considered not at all\nunsatisfactory, and could only have been done with the help of the\ngenerosity of several Members. For instance, as the result of hand-\nsome donations towards the Jubilee celebrations, not a penny of\nthe cost of the festivities fell upon the Society. In fact, the Society\nfound itself at the end with the balance of a few pounds over, which\nhad been expended on a badly needed clock with a Jubilee in-\nscription.\nThe Society received during the year a special donation of \u00a330\ntowards the printing expenses, and has since received from various\nmembers substantial promises of further contributions to the\nprinting. If it were not for these gifts and promises, we should have\nhad last year and this year to cut the amount of printed material\nvery substantially.\nEven more generous have been the donations available for re-\nsearch, amounting altogether to upwards of \u00a3155 during 1932. With\nthese donations the Council have felt justified in embarking on a\nforward policy in research, and it might interest the Meeting to\nhear some of the research work to be undertaken in the near future.\nThe most important would be the further investigation of Rudi\nSchneider by Dr Osty and our Society in collaboration. It was\nintended that this medium, whose phenomena had attracted great\nattention, should be studied continuously for several months under\nthe best conditions and with the assistance of the most up-to-date\napparatus. The Society was entitled to have a representative\npresent at all the sittings ; it would not probably be one and the\nsame representative for the whole period. This joint investigation\nhad been made possible partly by donations to the Society from\nmembers, and partly by a grant by the trustees of the Myers Me-\nmorial Fund.\nFru Ingeborg Kober (nee Dahl) had kindly consented to pav us\na visit during the course of the year, and this was another piece of\nwork, of a quite different kind, which should prove of great interest.\nIn the last few days a further experiment had been conducted with\nregard to Mrs Leonard. For the purpose of comparing the voices\nof the different Personal Controls at sittings with various sitters,\nMr Drayton Thomas had kindly permitted gramophone records to\nbe taken of one of his sittings in the same way as at Mr Irving's\nsitting, but in the Gramophone Company's studio, Mrs Leonard\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Aphil 1983\nkindly coming to London for the purpose. In addition, the Gramo-\nphone Company kindly permitted their studio to be used for a\nsimultaneous experiment to ascertain from what part of space the\ndirect voice at Mrs Leonard's sittings proceeds. This piece of work\nbadly needed doing, and of course it could not be done without some\nexpense. As soon as arrangements had been made for the experi-\nment, Mr Salter had written to the retiring President, Sir Oliver\nLodge, telling him of what was intended and that further funds\nfor this and other research work were needed, and Sir Oliver had\npromptly replied with a cheque. Mr Drayton Thomas had also\ngenerously contributed \u00a310.\nThe Society was actively engaged on research, including work of\na kind not being done by any other organisation, and such work\ncould not be undertaken unless the Society's ordinary income,\nreduced by heavy taxation and failure of some investments to pay\ntheir dividends, was supplemented by gifts from our members.\nIt was not perhaps an auspicious time to try to collect money for\nany purpose whatsoever, and he would not venture to make an\nappeal to our members in general to contribute to the best of their\nability were it not that the Council had definite projects in hand,\nwhich would more than absorb all the funds available for research\nand that our retiring President and other members had already\nshown such a good example.\nThe general financial position of the Society might fairly be\nconsidered hopeful. The loss of members owing to general poverty\nwas regrettable, but not a matter for panic. The Economy Com-\nmittee appointed a year ago estimated that a loss of income in\n1932, owing to the reduction in membership, of \u00a3194 was to be\nanticipated, but in fact, the loss was \u00a368 less than the estimate.\nThere was an increase last year in the number of new Members\nelected, and up to date there was a further increase over last year.\nAny member who could not himself contribute to the Research\nFund would help materially to improve the Society's position by\nintroducing new Members.\nA discussion followed in which the following Members took part :\nDr E. J. Dingwall, Mr G. W. Fisk, Mr W. H. Salter, and Admiral\nthe Hon. A. C. Strutt.\nThe Chairman announced that there were no candidates for\nelection to membership of the Council other than the six members\nwho retired by rotation, and she declared those six members\nre-elected accordingly. Their names are : The Rt Hon. The Earl\nof Balfour, Sir Ernest Bennett, M.P., Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart.,\nSir Oliver Lodge. F.R.S., Professor W. McDougall, and Mr S. G. Soal.\nMessrs Hartleys, Wilkins, Avery and Flew were re-elected\nAuditors for the forthcoming year.\n\fApril 1933 Private Meetings 53\nPRIVATE MEETINGS\nCommunications of a Personal Kind.\nThe 120th Private Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday,\n25 January 1933, at 5.30 p.m., Mr W. H. Salter in the Chair.\nMiss E. B. Gibbes read a paper on \" Some Communications of\na personal kind received through Miss Geraldine Cummins.\"'\nMiss Gibbes first expressed her compunction at revealing certain\naspects of family history. She pointed out that the best evidence\nfor the survival of human personality was generally of too intimate\na character to be published. In the interests of psychical research,\nhowever, she felt that it would be wrong to suppress a case which was,\nto her, so evidential of survival. Miss Gibbes went on to explain\nthat, though her case contained 19 statements made in automatic\nwriting at the sittings, which were unknown to her and to the\nautomatist at the time of writing, but which were subsequently\nverified, it was more from the point of view of the reproduction\nof personality that the Communications should be judged.\nThe Communications read purported to emanate from her two\ndeceased elder sisters and from T. M., a friend of one of them.\nT. M. had died three weeks after the death of her eldest sister,\nNorah. These three Communicators were entirely unknown to\nMiss Cummins and T. M. was a stranger to Miss Gibbes. \" Into\nthese Communications,\" Miss Gibbes remarked, \" is woven great\naccuracy of memory of early family feuds, and of controversies\nbetween her two elder sisters.\" It seemed that this ill-feeling\npersisted in the sphere in which these Communicators appeared\nnow to exist. The differences of opinion between these two sisters\nmust have originated at least twenty years before Miss Cummins\nwas born. In the scripts subsequently read by Miss Gibbes it was\nnoticeable that \" the old arguments and antagonisms were resusci-\ntated, the old petty grievances, quarrels and jealousies, recapitulated.\nAll the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of these two sisters were\nreproduced on paper by a woman who had met neither of them in\nlife, nor knew anything of their histories or characteristics.\"\nSoon after her death in 1925, Miss Gibbes's second sister, Evelyn,\npurported to write through Miss Cummins. Though Miss Gibbes\nbelieved the surviving consciousness\u2014or part of it\u2014was com-\nmunicating at the time, her distinctive personality did not fully\ndevelop until the alleged meeting in the beyond with the eldest\nsister, Norah, who died in 1928. Miss Gibbes explained that she was\nnever particularly interested in her elder sisters, and she did not\ndiscuss their peculiarities with Miss Cummins. Moreover, Miss\nGibbes and Miss Cummins were exceedingly occupied at that time\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1933\nwith the production of further portions of the Cleophas scripts and\nother matters. Very little thought, therefore, was given to the two\nsisters in question. In fact, Evelyn had died before Miss Cummins\nand she became at all intimate. She only visited her eldest sister,\nNorah, about once a year for two or three nights, and this at a time\nwhen Miss Cummins was away in Ireland. Therefore no details\nconcerning her would have been freshly in Miss Gibbes's mind and\nat once mentioned to Miss Cummins. All the latter knew concerning\nNorah was her name and the fact that she lived in the country :\nthat she had two sons : that she was trying to sell her house and\nthat she had a dog of which she was very fond. Miss Cummins\nknew nothing of the family history, its quarrels and peculiarities.\nIn fact, the characterisation of all the personalities referred to in\nthe scripts went far beyond the small amount of knowledge in the\nmind of the automatist.\nThere was also the unexpected introduction of T. M.. whose\npersonality and politeness were in strange contrast to the familiari-\nties of the two sisters. T. M. lived near Norah, but, so far as she\ncould recollect, Miss Gibbes had never met him. Neither did she\nknow anything about him beyond the following facts, which were\nalso known to Miss Cummins. They knew that he was a contributor\nto a leading Sunday newspaper, in which he frequently reviewed\nbooks, and that he was a friend of Norah and of her husband.\nThey saw the announcement of his sudden death in the papers,\nbut neither Miss Cummins nor Miss Gibbes knew anything of his\npersonality or of his affairs.\nThe death of Norah took place in a small, unattractive nursing-\nhome in Harrogate in the early hours of Thursday, 11 October 1928.\nMiss Gibbes had been wired for on the morning of the 10th and left\nLondon immediately. During the morning of 11th, Miss Gibbes\nsent a few lines to Miss Cummins asking her to endeavour to get\ninto touch with her sister Evelyn. The request to Miss Cummins\nin the south of Ireland, was as follows :\n\" Please ask Astor [one of\nMiss Cummins's Controls ]\nto find my elderly sister who died some\ntime ago and was spoken through you before. Tell her that the\nsister named Norah has just died and perhaps she can get the sister\ncalled Audrey to go to her.\" (Audrey is Miss Gibbes's third sister\nwho died at the age of 21 in 1894. She and Norah had been very\nfond of one another in their earth-life.) No further information\nwas given to Miss Cummins and Miss Gibbes knew neither when\nMiss Cummins would receive her letter nor when she would endeavour\nto get into touch. Owing to necessary business very little further\nthought was, in fact, given to the letter sent to Ireland.\nOn the morning of the 15th, Miss Gibbes received a script from\nMiss Cummins purporting to come from her sister Evelyn and dated\n\fAprtl 1933 Private Meetings 55\nthe evening of 12 October. This script contained many details\nwhich were quite unknown to Miss Cummins. The alleged Com-\nmunicator displayed a considerable knowledge of the affairs of the\nfamily and indicated that she recollected at least one dispute with\nNorah of which Miss Cummins was entirely unaware. Moreover,\nin characteristic fashion, Evelyn referred to the fact that Norah,\nin her young married days, used to \"go about and ride and was so\nproud and pleased with herself.\" Further, Evelyn wrote that Norah\nwould not want her to go to her, which would be quite in order\nseeing that, on earth, they continually quarrelled. She referred\nto the fact that Norah''s mind was so restless before her death. This\nwas also in order, for Norah was extremely worried prior to her\ndecease. Evelyn mentioned that Audrey was \" gentle and kind,\"\nwhich was also correct. In addition to this, Evelyn clearly indicated\nthat she was fully aware of the characteristics of the sister who, she\ndeclared, had just passed over to her vicinity.\nRealising that this script contained interesting evidence of sur-\nvival and displayed certain characteristics connected with her two\nelder sisters which were quite unknown to Miss Cummins, Miss\nGibbes refrained from making any allusion to the automatist\nconcerning either the communication or the recent death.\nOn Miss Cummins's return from Ireland sittings were resumed with\nMiss Gibbes. The first of these took place one month after the\ndeath of Norah on 10 November. On this occasion Evelyn again\npurported to write. She stated that she \" had actually talked\nwith Norah \" who was very anxious about her husband. She went\non to say that \" Norah, had such a pain in her chest before she died\n\"\n(correct), that \" she wasn't able to tell you \" (correct). She then\nproceeded to relate the fact that \" some old friend came to her just\nas I was talking, a man who brought her news. She was so sur-\nprised to see him. He broke into our conversation. There was\nsomething about a little dog. I know she mentioned a dog. Then\nwhen this other spirit came, he took up the point where I left off.\nHe seemed to be connected with some dog or dogs, for he started\nby saying, '\nAs the astounding fact is true that I am alive Mrs\nForbes it may well be that our dogs will follow us.' He talked then\nabout her husband and I was cut off.\"\nEvelyn stated that this friend seemed to \" have a lot to do with\nwriting and that he had left a half-finished article.\"\nThe friend turned out to be T. M., whose death had occurred\nthree weeks after that of Norah. He was devoted to dogs, a fact\nof which both Miss Cummins and Miss Gibbes were unaware. In\na later script Evelyn indicated that Major Forbes (Miss Gibbes's\nbrother-in-law) had given him one of their dogs. Major Forbes\ninformed Miss Gibbes that he and T. M. often discussed the possible\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1933\nsurvival of animals\u2014a fact also unknown to both sitter and medium.\nThe statement that T. M. left a half-finished book was afterwards\nverified.\nAt this same sitting Norah also purported to write. She intimated\nthat she was cognisant of the fact that Miss Gibbes was alone at\nHarrogate when she (Norah) died. \" Sitting by yourself in that\nhorrible place.\" and she made further statements which were\ncorrect and which were unknown to the automatist. The natural\nassumption on the part of Miss Cummins would be that others were\npresent. Norah wrote of how worried she was before her death\nand displayed anxiety as to the financial affairs of her husband.\nShe then sent the following message to her husband. \" Tell Austen\nthat we have met. I mean T. M. Tell him he is all right. Says\nhe saw him at his grave, and wanted to say, '\nCheer up, old chap.\nDon't pull such a long face.' \" Commenting later on this remark,\nMajor Forbes wrote :\n\" It is just what I should have expected him\nto say.\" Miss Cummins was unaware that Major Forbes had\nattended the funeral of T. M. In this communication Norah also re-\nferred to her two sons, making some characteristic allusions to\nthem. After this the pencil was again controlled by Evelyn, who\ngave details of the meeting between them. She stated that Norah\nhad immediately expressed to her her disapproval of the manner\nin which she (Evelyn) had arranged her will. This matter Norah had\nfrequently discussed with Miss Gibbes. Evelyn further stated that\nNorah had always been so \" domineering \" and displayed a vivid\nrecollection of the incessant disputes which used to take place\nbetween her and her sister when on earth.\nAmong other veridical statements made by T. M. was the following\ncontained in a message which he asked should be delivered to his\nfriend Major Forbes. \" Tell him I was right. We do survive whole\u2014\nnot piece-meal.'' In reply to Miss Gibbes, Major Forbes wrote,\n\" I remember T. M. in a talk we had about the future state, making\nuse of practically these words.\" Many other statements were made\nby T. M. which were unknown to Miss Cummins and to Miss Gibbes,\nbut which were subsequently verified by his widow or by Major\nForbes. For instance, the widow of T. M. verified the following\nremarks : It was stated that T. M. wore glasses, that he \" seemed\nworried about his glasses \" ; that \" he was wondering if dogs had\nsurvived,\" and had remarked that \" it would be most unfair if\nthey didn't \" ; that he was fond of the country and hated having\nto work in the city. Mrs T. M. wrote that \" he always worried over\nhis glasses \" and that he had often said in life that it would be most\nunfair if he survived and dogs did not. He also mentioned that he\nhad another child by a former marriage, a fact known only to very\nfew and certainly not to Miss Cummins or to Miss Gibbes. Other\n\fApril 1933 Private Meetings\ndetails unknown to them both were verified by Miss Gibbes's\nbrother-in-law.\nIn a few brief remarks Miss Gibbes endeavoured to analyse these\nwritings, pointing out that Miss Cummins was the writer also of\nThe Scripts of Cleophos and of Paul in Athens, and more recently of\nThe Road to Immortality, a series of automatic scripts purporting\nto be communicated by the late F. W, H. Myers. All of these, Miss\nGibbes remarked, were produced in precisely the same manner yet\nthe contrast in style was remarkable. She said that it must be\nadmitted that the scripts just read were extraordinarily human.\nShe claimed that neither telepathy nor latent telepathy would seem\nto account for these communications nor any of the other theories\nconnected with psychical research. She said that, in her opinion,\nthey were only explicable on the assumption that her sisters sur-\nvived death. She added that she herself came to this conclusion\nbecause of the convincing display of psychological traits exhibited\nin these writings rather than through the considerable number of\ncorrect statements made in them which were unknown to the\nautomatist.\nA discussion then followed in which Mr Mead, Miss Macklin,\nMiss Cummins, Mr Findlater and Mr Lambert took part.\nImplications of Telepathy\nThe 121st Private Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday,\n22 February 1933, at 5.30 p.m., The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton,\nG.B.E., in the Chair.\nMr W. Whately Carington's paper on \" Positive Implications\nof Telepathy \" was read by Mr W. H. Salter ; the following is an\nabridgment of it.\nIt may well be felt that some apology is needed for presenting to\nthe Society yet another paper on a subject which has already figured\nso largely in its activities. There is, however, at least one aspect\nof telepathy which seems to have been strangely neglected, namely,\nthat of the positive inferences which may reasonably be made if its\noccurrence as a fact in Nature be conceded.\nInterest in telepathy has, almost exclusively, taken the form\nof invoking it as a means of evading the plain implications of other\nphenomena ; in particular, it is constantly called upon as an\nexplanation alternative to that of communication by discarnate\nintelligences, which is the primafacie interpretation of most medium-\nistic utterances.\nOutside of a small body of instructed students, views about\ntelepathy appear to reduce to one or more of the following erroneous\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1933\npropositions :\n(1) Telepathy is an accepted fact of Science ; (2)\nTelepathy does not occur at all ; (3) Telepathy is in some way like,\nor akin to, \" wireless \"\n; (4) Telepathy is of no great importance\nanyway, except for dodging the supposed evidence for survival\nand communication. I most cordially dissent from each and all of\nthese views.\nIt is well known to members of this Society that not a few in-\ndividual men of science, including some of outstanding eminence,\nhave accepted telepathy as a vera causa ; and this is probably true\nof all who have seriously studied the evidence as a whole. But they\nthemselves would be the first to admit that telepathy does not\nenjoy, in the scientific world, a status in any way comparable with\nthat of orthodox physical phenomena even of the rarest types.\nIt would not be fair to attribute this attitude unreservedly to\nprejudice and apathy. On the contrary, it seems reasonable to\nsuppose that it results from a very proper, if often unwitting,\nsuspicion to the effect that once telepathy were conceded the whole\nmaterialistic apple cart would be irretrievably upset.\nThe main object of this paper is to show that this suspicion is\nperfectly correct ; in short, that no materialistic philosophy is at\nall compatible with the acceptance of telepathy as a genuine pheno-\nmenon. But deviations from the classical laws which appeared\nfinal and immutable a bare generation ago have become the rule\nrather than the exception, whenever extreme cases\u2014of distance,\nof temperature, of velocity or what-not\u2014are encountered ; so that\nwe ought to expect rather than to resent corresponding deviations\nfrom biological law when we intimately study Man\u2014the extreme\ncase of biological complexity known to us.\nUnfortunately, in addition to violating classical law, telepathy\nis severely handicapped by its unpredictability.\nBut we shall be seriously underrating the evidence if we suppose,\nas is too commonly the case, that it is limited to a few sets of de-\nbatably successful experiments supported by a relatively large\nnumber of dreams, monitions, coincidental impressions and the like,\nwhich may be persuasive but are certainly unassessable.\nThe all-important feature which telepathy shares with practically\nall the so-called \" mental \" phenomena of psychical research is\nthat of \" paragnosis.\" The percipient, that is to say, betrays an\nacquisition of knowledge (gnosis) which is beyond (para) what can\nbe ascribed to normal causes and the operation of classical law.\nBut it is precisely this feature which characterises the greater\nand by far the more important part of the evidence for survival\nand communication. Thus, unless we are prepared to take the rather\nunusual view that survival and communication are more probable\na priori than is telepathy, and to attribute all apparently telepathic\n\fApril 1933 Private Meetings\nphenomena to spiritistic intervention, we are perfectly entitled to\nclaim practically the whole of the evidence for survival as evidence\nfor telepathy, even though it may later prove to be evidence for\nsomething more.\nIn other words ; so long as we can concern ourselves with the\nlimited objective of paragnosis, we can throw into hotch-potch a\ngreat quantity of evidential material relevant to very diverse\nphenomena possessed of this common feature, including most of\nthose ostensibly of spiritistic origin. But if, by so doing, we success-\nfully break the ring fence of classical law, we can then re-marshal\nour evidence under its original headings and consider the claims\nof telepathy, psychometry, spiritistic communication and so forth\nseparately and on their individual merits.\nSo far is telepathy from strengthening the hands of sceptics in\ngeneral, that its concession as a fact necessarily destroys for ever\nthe materialistic position, imposes a radically different type of\nphilosophy and, so to say, makes the world safe for survival.\nIf telepathy had anything whatever to do with wireless, other\nthan lacking the wires so abundant in radio apparatus, if there\nwere any possibility of explaining it by any extrapolation of electro-\nmagnetic theory whatsoever, it would automatically lose all philo-\nsophic interest and drop to the level of a mere biological oddity.\nFortunately this does not appear to be the case for reasons which I\nwill now briefly indicate.\nThe most elementary point which arises is that as a matter of\nplain anatomical fact there exists no bodily organ, whether a part\nof the nervous system or not, of which the structure even remotely\nsuggests that it could in any circumstances act as a generator of\nelectro-magnetic radiation having the intensity and penetrative\npower required.\nMore important is the consideration that all free radiation must\nconform to the Law of Inverse Squares. That is to say, if you\ndouble your distance from the source the \" signal strength \" is\nreduced to one quarter of its original value ; at five times the distance\nit is one twenty-fifth and so forth. Now, although we know all too\nlittle about telepathy, one thing does seem clear, and that is that\ndistance has nothing whatever to do with it. Spontaneous and\nexperimental phenomena alike indicate pretty plainly that tele-\npathic paragnosis is as likely\u2014or unlikely\u2014to take place over a\ndistance of a thousand miles as over ten feet. This alone would be\nsufficient to knock the bottom out of any radiation theory, unless\nwe complicate it by postulating some directive mechanism to con-\ncentrate the radiation into a beam. But I do not think that any\nintelligent student would take such a suggestion seriously.\nMuch more important, however, are considerations relevant to\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1933\nthe underlying principles of the whole process supposed to be in-\nvolved, which must be essentially the same as that of all other\nforms of mundane communication.\nThe essential feature of every normal method of communication\nwhatsoever is the use of signs, signals or symbols, of one kind or\nanother, in accordance with an explicitly or implicitly recognised\ncode.\nThis is easily realised in the case of the transmission of messages\nby means of an artificially constructed code, such as Morse, or the\nelaborate letter and number codes used for commercial, diplomatic\nand military purposes, and it is equally true, if not quite so evident,\nof the ordinary processes of speech and writing.\nIt would appear, therefore, that if we are to accept the radiation\ntheory of telepathy, or, indeed, any physical theory whatsoever,\nwe must suppose that some process of encoding and decoding goes\non\n\u2014\nautomatically, unconsciously and with respect to an unknown\ncode. This seems fantastic to the point of incredibility and any\ntheory involving such suppositions should be regarded as a most\ndesperate pis alter to be adopted only if we find ourselves incapable\nof fitting telepathy into a more rational philosophic scheme.\nThe combined effect of these objections to physical theories of\ntelepathy is overwhelming and I wish to emphasise with all the force\nat my command that, if this be so, we have but two alternatives\nopen to us : either we must discard as spurious the whole of the\nevidence for paragnostic phenomena in general and telepathy in\nparticular, or\u2014conceding telepathy\u2014we must admit that we have\nsmashed for ever the limitations of matter and energy by which\nmaterialistic science once sought to confine us.\nThus so far from the fact of telepathy serving to explain away\nthe evidence for survival it serves rather to put the whole realm\nof non-physical phenomena on the map, even though we must\nat present mark it as largely unexplored.\nThe foregoing remarks may appear discouragingly negative to\nmany minds. I hope, in the remainder of this paper, to make\namends for my iconoclasm by showing three things, namely : first,\nthat the problem which has imposed the wireless analogy on us is a\nfalse problem ; second that once the true problem is envisaged a\nsimple solution presents itself ;\nthird, that this solution is congruent\nwith philosophic concepts which are not only impeccable in them-\nselves, but conform to important tendencies of modern thought.\nI suppose that to the man in the street, if he thinks about telepathy\nat all, the problem presents itself somewhat thus : How is it that\nan \" idea \" in the mind of A, at some particular place, gets trans-\nferred to the mind of B, at some other place ? Members of this\nSociety would presumably do better and would replace the conception\n\fApril 1933 Private Meetings 61\nof \" ideas \" floating about \" in \" minds, like goldfish in bowls,\nby something more sophisticated. Still, at the level of ordinarily\nintelligent discourse, we may fairly state the problem in the\nterms :\nHow is it that one mind, or consciousness, can act on another,\nregardless of the intervening distance, otherwise than by materially\nor quasi-materially transmitted signals or symbols ?\nMy contention is that this separation of minds is no more than\nsuperficially warrantable and that the conception of distance is\nessentially a logical fiction.\nFalse, or rather, superficial, distinctions between space and matter,\nbetween one object and another, between mind and mind\u2014arise\nfrom a too naive interpretation of experience. Most of us accept\nwithout question the superficial antithesis of the self and the not-\nself, of the consciousness of each and that of which each is conscious :\nand we do not ordinarily doubt that there exists a real external\nworld of \" things-in-themselves,\" which have properties, exert\ninfluences, are acted on by forces and so forth. But actually, as\nhas been pointed out often enough, all this is a pure fiction\u2014\na\nconvenient construct which happens to enable us to order our ex-\nperience in a manipulable kind of way. All we really know at first\nhand is the flux of our own states of mind\u2014the modulations of our\nown consciousness. Thus the localisation of \" things \" in particular\n'\"'\nplaces \" ; the subsequent view that \" A thing acts only where it\nis \" and the resulting problems concerning the mechanism whereby\nthings contrive to act on each other in final analysis to mere arti-\nficialities. If there is any sense at all in talking about \" things,\"\nexcept for engineering and allied purposes, it is more reasonable\nto say that a thing is where it acts than that it acts where it is.\nIn precisely the same way, I contend, it is absurd arbitrarily\nto localise consciousness somewhere and then to puzzle ourselves\nas to how it manages to act somewhere else.\nIf the mind of A acts upon the mind of B, it is because they are\ncoincident. Bisking a somewhat violent compression, I submit the\nview that : Telepathy comes about, not by transmission of ideas\nbut by community of consciousness ; not by the transference of\na Thought but by an identity of the Thinkers.\nThe general conception of an underlying community of conscious-\nness is far from discordant with modern thought in this field.\nHowever strongly we may agree with William James that \" The\npassing thought is the only Thinker that the facts require,\" we\nmust none the less admit that mental phenomena occur as if the\nmomentary content of consciousness were but a fraction of an\nindefinitely larger whole. This conception, largely due to Myers\nin its early stages is, I suppose, as firmly consolidated as any that\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1933\ncan be found in psychological science, and it would be no more than\na matter of prejudice to seek to deny on a priori grounds that\nsubliminal or subconscious strata may coalesce, as it were, or\nbecome continuous at a sufficiently recondite level, somewhat as\nthe islands of an archipelago find a common basis in the depths\nof the sea.\nIndications of such a view are common enough in psychological\nliterature.\n[Mr Whately Carington then quoted two passages from Dr\nTischner's Telepathy and Clairvoyance illustrating this point of view,\nand referred to the phenomena of multiple personality, the apparent\ncorporate consciousness of certain insects and the psychology of\ncrowds.]\nThere is one more line of thought which I should like to consider\nbriefly, the general character of all that is commonly referred to as\nmystical experience.\nIf there is really anything in the nature of a fundamental unity\nof consciousness in which we all live and move and have our being,\nso that our apparent isolation as individuals is only superficial,\nthen we may reasonably expect to find this unity occasionally\nrealised and the isolation transcended.\nNow, if we look at Mysticism in the large, ignoring the major\ndifferences between the Eastern and Western branches no less than\nthe smaller divergences of the various schools within these, we find\nas a cardinal principle common to all varieties of mystic, the con-\nviction, based on inner experience, that there exists a Greater\nConsciousness\u2014a Universal or Cosmic Consciousness\u2014with which\nthe aspirant, in rare moments at least, not only comes in contact\nbut is identified.\nSo long as he keeps to a recital of his own experiences, the mystic's\nevidence is as valid as your own account of falling off a 'bus. You\nmay disagree with his interpretations, you may even use the ter-\nminology of mysticism to define insanity ; but if a mystic says\nthat he has enjoyed a certain experience of enlarged consciousness,\nyou must either accept it qua experience or put him down as a\ndeliberate liar. Your quarrel with him legitimately begins only if\nhe is unwise enough to deny to your mundane experiences the\nvalidity which he claims for his own, or to talk\u2014as some have been\nso rash as to do\u2014about the \" unreality \" of matter.\nWhen we are thinking about telepathy we cannot ignore philo-\nsophy and, which is even more important, when we are thinking\nabout philosophy we cannot afford to ignore telepathy.\nThere can be little doubt that at the present time a notable\nchange is gradually making itself felt in philosophic thought. The\nold antithetic Materialism and Idealism are alike, being superseded\n\fApril 1933 Private Meetings 63\nsave in the minds of a few diehards. That is to say, the contention\nthat Mind alone is \" real \" and Matter only an illusion is gradually\nappearing as antiquated as the view that Matter alone is \" real\n\"\nand Consciousness a mere epiphenomenon. Even less tenable,\nof course, is the self-contradictory system which seeks to represent\nMind and Matter as radically distinct yet contriving, in some\nmagical fashion, to interact. I fancy that it would be difficult to\nreconcile the facts of telepathy with any of these naive views.\nOn the other hand, a standpoint which might fairly be called\nthat of psychological rationafism seems steadily to be gaining favour.\nIt connects up with telepathy and other conceptions introduced\nin the course of this paper somewhat as follows :\nIt is recognised that each of us has direct knowledge or experience\nonly of the changes in his own mental content\u2014which I term \" mod-\nulations of consciousness.\" When certain varieties or groups of\nthese are related to each other in particular ways it is our habit to\nsay that we are dealing with material objects forming a \" real\n\"\nworld external to ourselves. A different set of relationships, or\nslightly different groups of modulations related in a slightly different\nway leads us to judge that we are dealing with something unreal\nor illusory.\nThis kind of thing is, it seems to me, all that can reasonably be\nsaid about our knowledge of the External World, which is solely\na matter of formulating the relationships which subsist between\ncertain modulations of consciousness.\nIf this view is broadly correct, it becomes at once apparent that\nthe \" things-in-themselves,\" which we commonly think of as\nenjoying an autonomous existence and supporting the properties\nwhich we claim to observe, are no more than useful fictions created\nby ourselves for the more convenient ordering of our thought.\nBut this conclusion in turn at once requires us to account for\nwhat I may colloquially call the unanimity of experience. Broadly\nspeaking, a number of people looking at the same thing, as we say,\nwill report on it in similar terms and there seems no reason to doubt\nthat the modulations of their consciousness are in the main corres-\npondingly similar.\nNormally we take this unanimity for granted, but the moment\nwe begin to inquire into its origin an alternative of considerable\ninterest presents itself. The question is whether we are to locate it\noutside or inside ourselves, so to speak\u2014as a feature of the external\nworld or of our own consciousness. The former is the alternative\ninvariably adopted by the plain man and it is a perfectly sound\nprocedure for everyday life. But it is easy enough to show that the\nontological status of the supposed external world is not worth a\nmoment's purchase.\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Aphil 193$\nIt is, therefore, eminently reasonable to adopt the alternative\nview, namely, that the reason for the unanimity of experience is\nto be sought in Consciousness rather than in these supposititious\n\" things ;\" and thus this philosophical divagation brings us back\nagain to the conception of an underlying community of conscious-\nness to which my suggested view of telepathy led us. It is signi-\nficant that such diverse lines of thought should begin to form a\ntolerably coherent pattern so soon as such a conception is introduced.\nThe stability of the general view I have advocated lies not so\nmuch in the strength of individual contentions\u2014though all, I\nbelieve, are sound enough\u2014as in the coherence and reciprocal\nsupport of its several parts. Whether we begin with the possible\nmechanism of telepathy as such ; or with phenomena of a purely\npsychological character ; or with those of an important tract of\nreligious experience ; or with strictly metaphysical inquiry, we are\nled to very much the same kind of conclusion\u2014namely, the con-\nception of an underlying community of consciousness far more\nfundamental and far more important than the apparent segregations\nsuggested by superficial inspection or introspection.\nI venture to affirm that telepathy is destined to play a far more\nimportant part in moulding the thought of the future than it does at\nthe present time. There can be little doubt that the bridge between\nthe Rational and the Mystical, the Material and the Psychical, is\nnot only being built, but is nearing some kind of completion ; and\nI am by no means sure that telepathy will not prove to be the key-\nstone assuring continuity between the two approaches.\nIn the discussion which followed, Mr Hettinger, Dr Dingwall.\nRev. C. Drayton Thomas, Mr Mead, Mr Findlater, Mr Besterman\nand Mr Salter took part. In closing the discussion Mr Salter said\nthat he felt sure he would be justified in conveying to Mr Whately\nCarington, the best wishes of all members of the Society ;\nalthough\nMr Whately Carmgton was now, for business reasons, living abroad,\nhe continued to take a very lively interest in the Society's work\nand an active part in the work of the Committee of Reference.\nNOTICE.\nMr Walter Whateley Smith desires it to be known that he has\nresumed, as from 1 January 1933, the original surname of his\nfamily, and that he will henceforth be known as Walter Whately\nCarington.\n\fNo. 495.\u2014Vol. XXVIII May 1933\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nNOTICE OF MEETING\nA Private Meeting of the Society\nWILL BE HELD IN\nTHE SOCIETY'S LIBRARY\n31 TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON, W.C. 1\nON\nWEDNESDAY, 31 May 1933, at 5.30 p.m.\nWHEN A PAPER ON\n\"WHY I DO NOT BELIEVE IN\nSURVIVAL\"\nWILL BE READ BY\nProfessor E.

It was there stated that the exact time of Lady\n\fMay lf)33 Case 67\nRonald's death was not known. Further inquiries have since been\nmade, and it has been ascertained (by the kindness of the Coroner,\nMr Ingleby Oddie) that Lady Ronald was found unconscious at 7.20\non the morning of 25 July 1932, remaining so until her death at\n5.30 p.m. the following day. It will thus be seen that Mme de Lara's\nimpression almost synchronised with the finding of Lady Ronald.\nPROPHECY VERSUS PERSPICACITY.\nBy Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nLittle inclined as I am to believe in precognition and premonitions\nof future events, I admit that there do nevertheless exist in that\nsphere a few (very few !) puzzling cases. Let us here take one of the\nmost puzzling, analyse it and see if it is not susceptible of a normal\nexplanation. We are indebted for it to our highly esteemed\nCorresponding Member Professor Max Dessoir of Berlin, and I will\nreproduce it here from his book Vom Jenseits der Seek (1931),\npp. 145-6. with slight abbreviations.\nOn 3 August 1914 (let us note the date) Major Guido von Gill-\nhausen (Berlin) of the 3rd regiment of the Guards sent, we are told,\nin a registered letter to Prince Frederic-William of Prussia, at\nCamenz, a description of a vision (apparently) seen at 2 a.m. on the\nsame day. The vision\u2014it seems rather to have been a series of\nvisions\u2014deals with the coming war. Von Gillhausen sees passing\nbefore him \" many enemies \"\n;\namong them he recognises Belgium\nwith particular distinctness. Next to France he sees also England\nas Germany's chief enemy, which, he asserts, pushes forward,\ntramples upon and brutally dominates France. In Africa, von\nGillhausen further says, \" we shall also have to fight heavily \", and\nthere seem to be whites there who attempt to annihilate the Germans.\nBetween the two hemispheres von Gillhausen sees an indistinct\nform, as to the identity of which he is not certain (Spain ?). Italy\nhastens to join England, Russia and France. In the Balkans von\nGillhausen sees Serbia and Rumania. He tries to \" stiffen himself\nagainst Rumania \", but it \" remains \". Russia gives Germany\nmuch trouble, but finally succumbs, though helped by Japan,\nwhilst America helps England. Here von Gillhausen sees [Theo-\ndore] Roosevelt hand bread and wine to the King of England, pat\nhim on the shoulder and provide him with money, a powder-flask, a\ndagger and bullets. \" And yet was not Roosevelt our friend ?\n\"\nThe war will be fearful and will last many years. New enemies\nincessantly appear hurrying towards England from all parts of the\nearth. The Germans will have to fight over enormous distances\nand nearly all the peoples of the earth will take part in the fighting.\nVon Gillhausen sees the war extending from North America to\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1933\nAustralia and from Serbia and Japan to Cape Horn. England is\neverywhere. She is firmly entrenched in all the ministries of\nGermany's enemies and rules brutally and selfishly, all bowing down\nbefore her, without a single exception. Germany is in a dreadful\nstate and the year 1918 will be the worst. Only in 1920 does the\nwar seem to end\n\u2014\" or is it only an armistice ? so it seems to be.\"\n\" Will the Kaiser still live in 1921 ?\n\" Von Gillhausen sees him in an\nermine mantle with a crown on his head sawing off the legs of his\nown throne ; the ermine mantle grows more and more gray and\ndusty, gradually falling to pieces, whilst the crown gets smaller and\nsmaller and at last the Kaiser vanishes {in Nichts zerrann).\n\" It seems to me as if England received the death-blow in Egypt\nand India. I see there movement as in an ant-hill. Germany is\nterribly weakened by the war and wants thirty years to recover ;\nRussia wakes up and struggles with America for the possession of\nthe future. God be with us.\"\nAs stated above this remarkable prediction was sent early on the\nsame day to Prince Frederic-William, a covering letter requesting\nhim to keep the prophecy. Apparently the Prince took cognizance\nof it, but in Autumn 1915 returned it to the Major, in whose writing-\ndesk the prophecy was discovered by von Gillhausen's executors\nafter his death on 10 May 1918. We are told that that young officer\nhad never cared for politics, but had often experienced trances and\nseen visions foretelling the future in a remarkable way.\nAs Professor Dessoir nowhere implies that he has doubts as to the\nauthenticity of the von Gillhausen prediction, and as it is absolutely\ninconceivable that he should have reproduced it in his work if he\nhad such doubts, without stating them, we are bound to regard it\nas genuine. The question then arises whether we are therefore also\ncompelled to conclude that it implies foreknowledge of the future\nin the strict sense of the word.\nThe first obvious objection to occur to us will be that the World\nWar most undoubtedly engendered thousands of predictions. No\nless undoubtedly the great majority of these proved utterly ground-\nless. The von Gillhausen prophecy may have been one of the very,\nvery few relatively exact ones which have survived. I am personally\nacquainted with a case when the war was predicted (in 1917) at a\nspiritistic sitting to end on Sunday, 10 November ; as a matter of\nfact it ended on a Monday, 11 November. 1\nThe coincidence is very\nstriking, but how can we attach to this episode any decisive im-\nportance in the positive sense in view of the great number of pre-\ndictions most certainly made in the same sphere and subsequently\nbelied by the events ? Cannot chance, pure and simple\u2014too often\n1\nZeitschrift fur kritischen Olckultismus (1928), iii. 126.\n\fMay 1933 Prophecy versus Perspicacity 69\ninsufficiently taken into account\u2014-bring about at times the most\namazing coincidences ? The same argument could, I suppose, with\nequal force be applied to von Gillhausen's vision.\nI do not however wish to press it unduly. For we have here at\nhand another tentative explanation, at least as\u2014and possibly much\nmore\u2014satisfactory. Will not perspicacity explain the bulk of the\nvon Gillhausen \" prophecy %\n\" We are told, it is true, by Dr\nDessoir (on the authority of von Gillhausen's brother) that that\nyoung officer did not care for politics at all. But he was in any case\na cultivated man. Can we not therefore postulate unconscious\nperspicacity, perhaps manifesting itself with peculiar intensity m\nthe abnormal state in which von Gillhausen must have been m\nthe night from 2 August to 3 August, an unconscious perspicacity\nnot excluding perhaps lucky hits ?\nWe know in any case that conscious perspicacity can occasionally\nachieve in the same domain results at least equal if not more striking.\nI say \" We know,\" because we have happily in our possession a\ndocument of very great interest which proves this beyond the\npossibility of cavil. To the examination of that document we shall\nnow turn.\nM. Peter Dournovo had been under Alexander 111 (.Nicholas 11 s\nfather) director of the Russian Police Department, and under\nthe last of the Romanovs he was for rather a short time (1905-1906)\nMinister of the Interior. On his resignation he was appointed by\nthe Tsar member of the Council of the Empire (the House of Lords\nof Imperial Russia), where he was one of the leaders of the Right\nwing. Throughout his political career he had been a thorough\n;<\ndie-hard\" and a staunch enemy of the revolutionists. In\nFebruary 1914 he submitted to his Sovereign a memorandum on\nthe political situation. The memorandum began with the assertion\nthat Anglo-German rivalry was the \" central factor of the period\nwe are living in \" and that this rivalry will unavoidably result m an\narmed conflict between these two Powers, a conflict the issues of\nwhich will probably be \" mortal \" for the vanquished side. M.\nDournovo then attempted to prove that the then anglophile ten-\ndency of Russian diplomacy was erroneous ;\nthat Russia would\nderive no benefit from her rapprochement with England ;\nthat she\nhad no interest whatever in being estranged from Germany ;\nand\nthat on the contrary her interest lay in an agreement with that\ncountry, an agreement from which M. Dournovo did not exclude\nFrance and which he wished to see completed by a defensive alliance\nwith Japan. M. Dournovo then insisted on the tremendous\ndifficulties inherent for his country in a war with Germany, on the\ninadequacy in some respects of the Russian armaments, on the\nimpossibility of recuperating the gigantic expenses incurred m such\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1933\na war, even in the case of eventual victory, and on the fact that a\nsocial revolution of a most radical character would be inevitable in\nRussia should that country be defeated (he added that the same\nwould happen to Germany if vanquished).\nThe chief interest of the Dournovo memorandum lies however\nelsewhere : in his analysis of the positions to be occupied by different\nStates, should a war break out. It is to him \" obvious \" that\nRussia, France and England will form one \" basic \" group, whilst\nGermany, Austria and Turkey will make another. It is \" more\nthan probable \" that other Powers too will take part in the conflict.\nItaly, if she understands ever so little her interests, will not join\nGermany. More than this : the possibility of her joining the\nanti-German coalition if the war should take a turn favourable to\nthe latter, is not excluded. Her position is similar to that of\nRumania, who will probably remain neutral until the fortune of war\nhas favoured this or that side : then \" led by a healthy political\negotism \" Rumania will join the victors in order to be rewarded\nat the expense either of Russia or of Austria[-Hungary]. Serbia\nand Montenegro will most certainly side with the enemies of Austria,\nwhilst Bulgaria and Albania\n\u2014\" supposing the latter to have\nformed at the time if only an embryonic State \"\n\u2014will be among\nthe enemies of Serbia. Greece will probably remain neutral or will\njoin the enemies of Turkey, but only after the issue of the war has\nbecome more or less clear. The participation of Sweden in the war\nis to be apprehended, \" of course \" on the side of Russia's enemies.\nM. Dournovo is further of opinion that the main burden of war\nwith Germany will fall on Russia, \" since England is hardly able to\ntake part in a continental war on a large scale,\" whilst France which\nis poor so far as \" human material \" is concerned \" will probably\npursue strictly defensive tactics.\" Russia will therefore have to\nplay the chief part notwithstanding so many hostile factors. From\nthese factors the [Far] East is however to be excluded. America\nand Japan are both hostile to Germany, the former from its very\nnature, the latter \" in view of the present political orientation.\"\nRussia's rear is therefore completely secured so far as the Far East\nis concerned : at most she will have to pay for a benevolent neutra-\nlity with some economic concessions. More than this, it is con-\nceivable that America and Japan will side with the enemies of\nGermany, but of course will content themselves with seizing badly\nprotected German colonies. On the other hand a new explosion\nof hostility to Russia in Persia will undoubtedly occur, troubles\namong the Moslems of the Caucasus and of Turkestan are possible\nand an intervention of Afghanistan against Russia in connection\nwith these troubles is not excluded. Finally, very unpleasant\ncomplications in Poland and in Finland are to be foreseen ; in the\n\fMat 1933 Prophecy versus Perspicacity 71\nlatter country an insurrection will unavoidably break out if Sweden\nhappens to be among Russia's enemies. As for Poland it is to be\nexpected that Russia will be unable to keep that country in her\nhands during the whole war : therefore when in the enemy's hands\nthe latter will most certainly attempt to provoke an insurrection :\nanother unfavourable if not very dangerous factor. Apart from\nthis \" the influence of our allies may well induce us in the sphere of\nour relations with Poland to acts more dangerous for us than any\nopen insurrection.\" In the last sentence the Russian \" die-hard\n\"\nspeaks out distinctly.\nWe shall now proceed to an analysis of both documents leaving\naside in the von Gillhausen prophecy such statements as still await\nfulfilment, such as England receiving the death-blow in India and\nEgypt, Germany needing thirty years to recover, etc.\nWhat strikes us most first of all in this prophecy, is the categorical\nstatement that the war will last a long time. Of course Lord\nKitchener stated later in the same year (1914) that it would last\nthree years at least ; but then it was Lord Kitchener ! That the\ngreat majority of the German officers thought otherwise and ex-\npected a campaign of a few months' duration may well be presumed.\nAnother point to be noted is the extension in space assigned by\nvon Gillhausen to the war, which, he says, he sees raging from North\nAmerica to Australia and from Japan and Serbia to Cape Horn. Of\ncourse something of the kind was likely to occur once Great Britain\nand her Dominions and Colonies, not to mention her Allies, were to\nfight not only the German Empire but also its Colonies, but the\npicture is impressive. Less impressive is the fact that France,\nBelgium and Great Britain are emphatically stated to be Germany's\nenemies early in the morning of 3 August, whilst war was declared\nby Germany on France on that day, but some hours later, and whilst\nBelgium and England declared war only on the 4th. It is to be\nexpected that in von Gillhausen's milieu Germany's plan of invading\nBelgium (though not of course Belgium's refusal to let the German\narmy pass !) was already known on 2 August ; as for England\nmaking war it was not an unreasonable deduction (though not a\ncertain one) from the whole international situation. A Franco-\nGerman war on the other hand became inevitable after Germany\nhad declared war on Russia on 1 August. Whether Belgium did\nreally inflict on Germany, as von Gillhausen's prophecy asserts,\n''frightful wounds in boundless cruelty\" might perhaps be\nquestioned.\nNo mention of Belgium appears in the Dournovo memorandum,\nbut the part to be played by England in the future conflagration is\nthere specified not one or two days before 4 August but months\nbefore.\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1933\nWe now pass to other items figuring either in both documents or\nintone of them :\nItaly. Von Gillhausen says positively that Italy will \" hasten\n\"\nto join England, Russia and France (the word \" hasten \" is hardly\nexact since Italy declared war on Austria only at the end of May\n1915). Dournovo is less explicit. As is well known, some clair-\nvoyant Germans and Austrians had long foreseen the part Italy\nwould play in a European war ; whether many Austro-German\ndiplomatists were among these clairvoyant people may well be\ndoubted (Dournovo, by the way, had never been a diplomatist).\nRumania. The passage dealing with Rumania in the von Gill-\nhausen prophecy is very remarkable : he cannot understand, he\nsays, why Rumania is there and tries to get rid of her (\" stiffens\nhimself against her \"), but without success. This insistence is\nstriking, though it is not expressly stated that Rumania will be\namong German's enemies. Dournovo rightly foresees that Rumania\nis very likely not to adhere to the Austro-German coalition but does\nnot go further. He sees however Rumania obtaining territorial\nadvantages at the expense of either Austria-Hungary or Russia.\nAs a matter of fact Rumania has obtained such advantages from\nboth sides by annexing both Bessarabia (Russia) and Bukovina,\nTransylvania and the Banat (Austria-Hungary).\nTurkey. It will be remembered that Turkey declared war on\nRussia only in October 1914, several months after the hostilities\nhad begun. It is conceivable that it would not have sided with\nGermany and Austria-Hungary at all if the Entente had behaved\nmore energetically\u2014and more intelligently ; in particular if the\ncruisers Goben and Breslau sent by the Kaiser to Constantinople had\nbeen prevented from entering the Dardanelles. Therefore its\nparticipation in the war was not a foregone conclusion.\nBulgaria. That country had been liberated by Russia from the\nTurkish yoke in 1877-1878, streams of Russian blood being shed.\nTo many Russians the idea of Bulgaria joining in a European war\nan anti-Russian coalition would therefore have appeared before\n1914, in spite of the second Balkan War of 1913 (Bulgaria against\nSerbia, Greece and Rumania), as almost preposterous. Not so to\nDournovo.\nGreece. That country remained in fact more or less neutral\nthrough almost the whole war, joining the Entente only in 1917\nafter King Constantine's forced abdication.\nAs neither Turkey, nor Greece, nor Bulgaria are mentioned in von\nGillhausen's vision whilst their future positions in the war are quite\ncorrectly delineated by Dournovo, the Russian statesman here\nscores heavily over the Prussian officer and seer.\nThe latter takes a revanche so far as Russia is concerned, which\n\fMay 1933 Prophecy versus Perspicacity 73\ncountry he rightly sees \" succumbing, \" whilst Dournovo thinks\npossible both a victory and a defeat of the Russian Empire and does\nnot commit himself.\nSo far as America and Japan are concerned, both the Russian and\nthe German are positive that these two countries will not join\nGermany, but von Gillhausen states categorically that they will help\nrespectively England and Russia whilst Dournovo is not so explicit :\nhe simply admits the possibility of their siding with the Entente.\nIn the part of his memorandum dealing with Poland (not men-\ntioned by von Gillhausen at all), there are some statements more or\nless corresponding with future events. As a matter of fact Russian\nPoland passed in 1915 from Russian into German hands, though\nthere was no \" insurrection \" strictly speaking. And in August\n1914 already some promises were given to Poland in a manifesto\nsigned by the Grand Duke Nicholas, Commander-in-Chief, which\npromises were undoubtedly in accordance with the wishes of\nRussia's allies.\nThe Kaiser. The von Gillhausen prophecy contains a very\nstriking and picturesque passage which must be interpreted as\nsignifying that William II will vanish from the scene. No mention\nof the Kaiser's probable fate occurs in the Dournovo memorandum,\nthough in another part its author contemplates the possibility of a\nsocial revolution in Germany, which he even thinks (wrongly it\nappears) is likely to assume proportions as frightful as the Russian\nupheaval.\nWe shall now pass to the erroneous statements which both docu-\nments contain. Von Gillhausen throws out tentatively the date\nof 1920 as that of the Peace or Armistice and that of 1921 as possibly\nconnected with the Kaiser's death. Both are wrong, and this\ncircumstance deprives of much of its value the mention of the year\n1918 as a year of particular hardship for Germany, which would\notherwise have been very impressive. It is also to be presumed that\nvon Gillhausen's statements as to the character of the Anglo-French\nrelations during the war will appear quite incorrect if not ludicrous\nto most Englishmen. Two of Dournovo's mistakes the Anglo-Saxon\nreader will have already noticed : one deals with Great Britain's\nsupposed incapacity to lead a war on the continent ; the other\nconsists in asserting that America, if she declares war on Germany,\nwill content herself with seizing some ill-defended German colonies.\nIn estimating other mistaken statements we are somewhat ham-\npered by the fact that they are sometimes formulated in a dubitative\nform, e.g., Sweden will be found among Russia's enemies if it takes\npart in the war and Finland will then revolt ; Albania will side\nwith the enemies of Serbia if Albania has already become an em-\nbryonic State. Still, it is definitely asserted that an explosion of\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1933\nanti-Russian feeling will \" undoubtedly \" take place in Persia (most\nprobably a prediction unconfirmed by fact) and there are other\nmistaken assertions. Dournovo is therefore not infallible. But\nvon Gillhausen is not infallible either and it is curious that he is-\nsilent on the most crucial point, viz., whether his country will\nvanquish or be defeated. (Is not his account of his vision purposely\nincomplete on that point ?) On the whole, it is pretty safe to assert\nthat the Russian statesman's foreknowledge as displayed in his\nmemorandum to the Tsar is by no means inferior to that of the\nPrussian officer\u2014to say the least.\nIt must not be forgotten that the von Gillhausen prophecy is one\nof the most extraordinary\u2014if not the most extraordinary\u2014political\nprophecies we know of. By the way, though not free from mistakes,\nit well exemplifies a typical weakness inherent in that class of\nalleged supernormal \" phenomena \" : the more extraordinary a\nprophecy, prediction or premonition, the more we are inclined, after\nits fulfilment, to doubt its genuineness ! It is pretty sure that the\nvon Gillhausen vision will prove no exception to that sinister rule,\nand that many people on becoming acquainted with it will say. now\nthat it has been partly fulfilled : it is a hoax !\nTo this objection (unfounded, I think) the Dournovo case is not\nopen. The memorandum was published in a Soviet review (the\nKrasnaia Nov) as far back as 1922 and about that time I read an\nextract from it, which impressed me greatly, in a Russian daily\nthen published in Berlin. Still, though it was difficult to understand\nwhy the bolsheviks should have forged a document so much to the\ncredit of the intellectual faculties of a statesman who had invariably\nshowed himself a fierce opponent of the enemies of the Tsarist\nregime, a very slight doubt as to the authenticity of the memoran-\ndum may have lingered in my mind. Quite recently however I\nwas lent a typewritten copy of it by a friend of mine and former\ncolleague at the Russian Imperial Foreign Office, which copy that\nfriend made as far back as August or September 1914. It is this\ncopy I have used for my present paper. Needless to say that\nsource has nothing in common with bolshevist sources. The\ngenuineness of the Dournovo memorandum seems to me therefore\nalmost or quite beyond question and that document may be con-\nfidently used as a basis for speculation.\nWe are therefore justified in concluding that : Perspicacity\n{political perspicacity at least) may occasionally bring about results at\nleast as bewildering as so-called prophecy or premonition. We are not\nbound therefore to postulate a supernormal explanation, seeing that a\nnormal one is proved to be perfectly legitimate\u2014especially if we keep\nin view the possibility of lucky chance-coincidence besides.\n\fMat 1933 Correspondence 75\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nSupernormal Occurrences in Classical Antiquity.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014My thanks are due to Professor E.

I did not attempt to criticise his discussion\nof the relation of spiritualism and Neoplatonism ; for I have not\nstudied either of those subjects\u2014the little I know about spiritualism\nhas been taught me by the S.P.R. But in so far as his previous paper\ntook account in general of Greek thought about immortality, there\nseemed to me to be no irrelevance about calling attention to what\nanother great scholar has advanced on the subject, especially as\nFriedlander prefaces his remarks with the observation that belief\nin an inner connection of the spirit world with the world of the\nliving and a constant invasion of the latter by the former was, among\nboth Greeks and Romans, both widespread and very old.\nYours, etc.,\nH.

Price 6s.\nnet.\nMiss Cummins is a non-professional automatic writer, the daughter\nof the late Professor Ashley Cummins, M.D., of Cork. She is already\nknown to readers of psychic books through her volume entitled\nThe Scripts of Cleophas and other writings. In the volume under\nreview she presents some communications purporting to come from\nthe late F. W. H. Myers. She had not read Human Personality and\nits Survival of Bodily Death, and knew very little about him. The\nwriting was done at great speed, sometimes at the rate of two thou-\nsand words in an hour and a quarter. The sensitive's state was one\nof abstraction or semi-trance, and her friend Miss Gibbes changed\nthe sheets of paper as required.\nThe matter consists mainly of descriptions of after-death states,\nand these are something like the scheme of the Theosophists, though\nin slightly different terminology. There is Hades, which is a place\nof quiet rest ; Illusion-land or Summerland, where the soul lives in\nits memories, the plane of colour ; the plane of flame ; the plane of\nlight ; and the plane of timelessness. There is reincarnation, at\nleast for some souls, and some of these reincarnations occur on other\nplanets ; the soul can choose whether it will go up or down, and its\nnext incarnation will depend as to its conditions on the desires of\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat 1933\nof each soul. Spiritual evolution is the purpose of creation, and the\nend appears to be the attainment of oneness with God. This goes\nsomewhat beyond the aims and objects of our Society, but it is an\ninteresting scheme of existence, and there is much in it that is worth\npondering. It is to be noted that Miss Cummins had not studied\nTheosophic literature, and that she had practically no knowledge\nof the work of Myers.\nAs some indication that Miss Cummins's scripts often contain\ndefinitely evidential matter, Miss Gibbes gives condensed accounts\nof messages from people quite unknown to her or to her friend ;\nfacts appear to have been given which cannot be attributed to\nnormally acquired knowledge or to telepathy from the sitter.\nAs to the authenticity of the Myers communications, we cannot\nfeel sure, either one way or the other. But Sir Oliver Lodge tells\nus, in his Foreword, that the scripts seem to him a genuine attempt\nto describe the conditions of the after-life, and that the ideas are\nin many ways characteristic of Myers. And Sir Oliver is probably\nthe best living judge, for he knew Myers intimately. Miss Gibbes\nis a careful and critical investigator, and the book may be com-\nmended to the attention of all students of psychical research\nliterature.\nJ A H\nDas Ratsel von Konnersreuth im Lichte eines neuen Falles von Stigma-\ntisation. Von Dr. med. Alfred Lechler. Elberfeld, Licht\nunci Ze&en-Verlag.\nOne of the chief arguments used by Roman Catholics who believe\nin the supernatural character of so-called stigmatisation is, as is well\nknown, the assertion that hitherto no one has been able to produce\nstigmata by suggestion. From this standpoint the little book (53\npages) just published by Dr. Lechler deserves attention, and its\nauthor may well have been a bahnbrecher.\nElisabeth K., Dr. Lechler's patient, entered his service in Febru-\nary 1929 (she was born in 1902). She had been suffering from various\nailments from which he cured her by hypnotism. He found her\neminently suggestible. On Good Friday 1932 she felt pains in her\nhands and feet (she had been present at a Lichtbilderabend on the\nsufferings and death of Christ). Dr. Lechler suggested to her in the\nhypnotic state that she should have wounds where she felt pain ;\nand this suggestion was carried out next morning. He then sug-\ngested to her in the waking state that the wounds should become\ndeeper, also that Elisabeth should have tears of blood : again with\nfull success. Then, also in accordance with a suggestion made, the\ntears of blood disappeared and the wounds on the hands and feet\nclosed.\nThese suggestions were repeated several times later on. They\n\fMay 1933 Reviews 77\nsometimes failed, apparently when Elisabeth was unable to con-\ncentrate her thoughts adequately on the results expected. At other\ntimes they were completely successful. Besides the stigmata on the\nhands and feet and the \" blood tears,\" Dr. Lechler was also able to\ninduce artificially the appearance on Elisabeth's forehead of traces\nleft as by a \" crown of thorns.\" He also made her see visions of the\nPassion, she viewing them with such an intensity that she thought\nherself to be crucified (p. 17). Elisabeth did not \" fast \" d la Therese\nNeumann, but Dr. Lechler mentions that on several occasions he\nsucceeded in increasing by suggestion his patient's weight. On other\noccasions, however, suggestions not to lose weight, though Elisabeth\nate little or nothing, failed.\nThe hypothesis of fraud the author thinks completely excluded\nbecause of Elisabeth's straightforward character in which he firmly\nbelieves. Needless to say that by themselves such subjective im-\npressions have very little value. Still some of the observations bear-\ning on the stigmata appear to have been made under good conditions\nof control (pp. 15, 16) ; whether these conditions made elaborate\npreliminary manipulations of a fraudulent character impossible is.\nof course, another question, as to which I do not feel competent to\njudge.\nFrom Elisabeth K. Dr. Lechler passes to Therese Neumann ; he\nsees much analogy between both cases, as there undoubtedly is, and\nattempts a \" natural \" explanation of the Konnersreuth happenings.\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nZeitschrift fur metapsychiscJie Forschung, 1932.\nJanuary.

Jones, Bart, (later\nMr G. W. Lambert) in the Chair.\nMrs W. H. Salter read a paper on \" Some Unprinted Cases\nillustrating Difficulties of Investigation \". Mrs Salter described\na number of cases investigated by the Society's officials in recent\nyears, explaining in each case the various reasons why they had\nbeen found unsuitable for printing.\nA discussion then followed in which Mr G. W. Lambert, Mr\nHettinger, Dr Dingwall, Mr Findlater, the Kev. C. Drayton\nThomas, Lady Dewar and Miss Fleming took part.\nNOTICE.\nFurther Gramophone Records.\nIn the Journal for January 1933 (xxviii. 2-3) it was announced that\nthe Society had caused gramophone records of a sitting with Mrs\nLeonard to be made. These records permanently preserve for\nleisured study adequate specimens of the Feda Control, including\nexamples of the so-called direct voice, and the whole of a feminin 3\nPersonal Control, that of \" Dora \" (Mrs Irving). These records\nwere offered for sale to Members and Associates of the Society and\na considerable number has been bought.\nAn addition to this series of records has now been made, with\nthe generous co-operation of the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas. The\nnew record gives an excellent rendering of part of a male Personal\nControl, that of \" Mr John \" (the Rev. John Thomas). It is of\nconsiderable interest when compared with the \" Dora \" records.\nAnother new record of a different kind has been made by Lord\nCharles Hope and kindly put by him at the disposal of the Society.\nThis records typical specimens of the breathing of Rudi Schneider\nwhen in trance. It is well known that this breathing, at an average\nrate of 200 per minute, forms one of the most unusual aspects of\nthis medium's trance and one of which no adequate explanation\nhas yet been found.\nBoth these new records are on sale to Members and Associates\nat 5s. each, a price which is only a little above the actual cost of\nthe records to the Society (quite apart from the cost of the original\nrecording)\n.\nApplication for records should be made to the Secretary, the\nSociety for Psychical Research, 31 Tavistock Square, London,\nW.C. 1, not later than 31 July 1933. A few copies of the\noriginal ten records are still available.\n\f8-4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1933\nNOTE ON AN ATTEMPT TO LOCATE IN SPACE THE\nALLEGED DIRECT VOICE OBSERVED IN SITTINGS\nWITH MRS LEONARD.\nAs the result obtained was not a positive one this note is kept as\nbrief as possible and is restricted to essentials.\nThe method employed was an adaptation of the well-known\ndouble-tube method. It was suggested by Dr Irons, through the\nintermediary of Mr Soal. Two pairs of microphones, as shown on\nthe following diagram, were used. Each pair of microphones was\nconnected with a pair of ear-phones in a distant room, each micro-\nphone being connected by a different channel with its appropriate\near-phone. The sensitiveness, etc., of the microphones was care-\nfully balanced, slight inequalities in the ear-phones being com-\npensated by appropriate balancing of the microphones.1\nMr Heard and Mr Besterman acted as observers ;\nby careful\npreliminary calibration on two occasions, once immediately before\nthe sittings, they succeeded in distinguishing displacements in\nspace from the normal position, i.e. that of the medium, of some-\nthing less than six inches in any horizontal direction. It was found,\nhowever, that this method would be unsuitable for the observation\nof sounds liable to be produced from different and alternating\nsources, owing to the serious lag in localising such sounds. Again,\nit was found that fatigue supervened fairly rapidly and produced\nserious errors.\nThe sitting was held on 16 January 1933, with the Rev. C.\nDrayton Thomas as sitter, gramophone records being taken simul-\ntaneously. The notes made by the two observers exactly agreed.\nA supposed direct voice was heard four times, as follows (approxi-\nmately corrected times) :\na.m.\n11.211 \u00ab peter\n\"\n11.34. \" sure to be\n\"\n11.341. \"verified\"\n11.35. \"considerable\"\nOn none of these occasions was the voice found to be displaced\nin space, i.e. to emanate from a source in space other than the posi-\ntion occupied by the medium.\n1\nThis work was carried out by the Gramophone Co.'s technical recording\nstaff, to whose efficient and willing help we are much indebted.\n\fJune 1933 Note on Attempt to Locate Alleged Direct Voice 85\nGramoplione Co.'s studio, Abbey Road, N.W. 8.\no o\nScale\n:\nr=i ft.\nO = microphones.\nX = centre of medium's position.\nNote : two separate microphones, placed between the pairs shown above, were\nnsed for the gramophone recording.\nTHEODORE BESTERMAN.\nGERALD HEARD.\nCASE.\nL. 1298. A Dream of an Explosion.\nWe have received the following case from the Baroness de Kakucs,\na Member of the Society :\n\"During the night of the llth-12th 1\nFebruary I had a most\nvivid dream. I thought I was standing on the verandah of a\nforeign type of house, looking over a hilly and wooded country.\nA heavy black cloud was hanging over everything, and the sky and\nthe look of the atmosphere frightened me. I thought the end of\nthe world was coming. I saw a terrible flash of light, and heard\na loud explosion ; the ground rocked, and thinking the house was\ngoing to fall in I rushed out, calling to the other people in it to get\nclear. I shouted so loud that I woke myself up, and thought that\nthere must have been an earthquake. My bed seemed to rock\nviolently. I do not know what the time was. I told my sister-in-\nlaw about it in the morning, before I had seen a newspaper, or\n1\n[In reply to an inquiry Baroness de Kakucs explains (16 and 19. ii. 33)\nthat this is a clerical mistake for 10th- 11th, and as this letter is dated the\n11th (received the 13th, the 12th being a Sunday) this is no doubt the case].\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June 1933;\nheard of the Saar explosion ; and said :\n'\nI bet we shall hear\nthere has been an earthquake somewhere '.\nI don't remember ever having had a dream of this description\nbefore -\n[Signed] G. H. S. Crofton.\"\n\"Major Crofton told me about his dream, on the morning of\nFeb. 11th before he or anyone in the house had seen a newspaper.\nWe never get our papers here until about 11.30 a.m. and on this\nparticular morning they did not come until 12.45. I met the\nboy at the gate with them. I remember that Major Crofton said\nthat it was a foreign type of house, and that he was sure we should\nhear of an earthquake. He seemed much impressed with his\nfeeling of terror and panic. [Signed] Enid D. Kakucs.\"\nIn answer to a question Baroness de Kakucs states (19. ii. 33)\nthat the wireless in the house had been disconnected for six months\nbefore the date in question. Explosions are not, of course, parti-\ncularly infrequent, nor was the dream very specific, but as this\nappears to have been the first time that Major Crofton dreamed of\nan explosion, the incident is worth recording. The explosion in\nthe Saar occurred at 6 p.m. on 10 February 1933, according to\nthe reports in The Times.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nOn the Possibility op Proving Survival.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I have studied with much interest the extremely interesting\narticle contributed by Dr J. B. Rhine to the March number of the\nJournal, wherein he discusses certain types of evidence for survival\nin the light of my paper published in Proceedings, xl. He suggests\nthat \" peculiar motivation is more indentificative of the agency\ninvolved than are data from the past life of the individual con-\ncerned, facts describing his personality or physical manifestations\nclaimed to be due to his efforts \". I agree. On page 115 of the\npaper in question I said, referring to the reproduction of psycho-\nlogical characteristics, which, of course, include \" peculiar motiva-\ntion \", that \" it was here that we might hope to find the most con-\nvincing . . . evidence for survival,\" and again on page 117, \" Habitual\nforms of thought and association of ideas are one of the most in-\ndividual characteristics of any person and it seems to me that if a\nlarge number of instances of reproductions of this nature . . . could\nbe collected, a fairly strong presumptive case for survival might\nbe established \". I think that \" peculiar motivation \" may fairly be\nincluded under \" habitual forms of thought and association of ideas \".\n\fJune 1933 Correspondence 87\nFurther, Dr Rhine claims no more than that cases of the type\nwhich he suggests \" offer better assurance of survival \" ; he does\nnot claim that alternative explanations are completely excluded.\nHe would admit, I take it, that the necessity of verification, implying\nas it does the existence of knowledge in the possession of some\nliving person, or of some other form of record, must provide a\ntheoretically possible alternative in all conceivable cases.\nSo far, therefore, it seems that Dr Rhine and myself are in sub-\nstantial agreement. But when we come to cases, it is possible that\nin spite of our agreement on general principles, our estimates of the\nplausibility of the survival hypothesis might show very large\ndivergence. The main thesis which I endeavour to establish in my\npaper is that conviction of the truth or otherwise of the survival\nhypothesis must always be a matter of individual idiosyncracy. It\nis a function of two independent variables, both of which rest on\nindividual opinion. The first is the antecedent acceptability of\nsurvival and this is determined to a large extent by factors entirely\noutside the province of psychical research. On it will depend\nwhether the evidence from any particular case will find a relatively\nopen road or encounter grave obstacles in its path. It seems\nreasonable that I should demand a higher degree of probability in\nthe evidence before accepting an hypothesis which is antecedently\ninacceptable than one towards which I am already favourably dis-\nposed. Whether reasonable or not, the fact remains that we all do\nmake this demand.\nThe second variable is the estimate of probability of the survival\nhypothesis in any particular case against that of the alternatives.\nAs regards the first I have no means of comparing Dr Rhine's posi-\ntion with my own, but in the matter of the relative probabilities\nof the evidence for survival in his hypothetical cases I think that\nthere might, very likely, be considerable differences between us.\nFor example, take the first case, that of the woman whose deceased\nhusband purports to send a message telling her to consult a doctor.\nI cannot agree that the \" motivation \" is so clearly that of the\nhusband. The woman herself might have just as powerful a motive,\nor her children, her relatives or friends. It is not unknown for a\nhusband to be comparatively callous concerning the health of his\nwife.\nMoreover, though the woman ex hypothesi does not consciously\nknow of her impending trouble, we have so much evidence of the\nwider knowledge of the state of the subject's organism possessed\nby the sublimiiial, that it is not unreasonable to suppose that she\nmight have been subconsciously aware of the tumour ; in fact, I\nshould be inclined to think that she would be the most likely person\nto possess that knowledge.\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1933\nOn the other side, of course, the intrusion into an alien sitting\nand the impersonation of the husband by the alleged communicator,\nhave to be explained. This, undoubtedly, presents difficulty, but\nI think might be overcome by a little ingenuity.\nI do not desire to overdo my self-imposed role of advocatus\nDiaboli. I admit that such a case would be a good one. What I\nwant to make clear is the number of points on which differences of\nopinion, more or less serious, could arise between two impartial\nand unprejudiced persons whereby the degree of plausibility of the\nsurvival hypothesis would be materially affected. And this was\nthe main purpose of my paper. Apodeictic proof is impossible, con-\nviction or plausibility is subjective.\nI do not think it necessary to trespass further on your space by\ndiscussing in detail the other suppositious cases put forward by\nDr Rhine. They each have their peculiar features of strength and\neach has its own inherent weaknesses, hence the same general\nprinciples of criticism would apply to all. I would, however, beg\npermission to put forward a suggestion which is, I think, relevant to\nthis matter.\nIn my experience, so far as it goes, it is very unusual for an\nostensible communicator to get a clear, coherent message through\nthe medium at his first appearance. As a rule the earlier communi-\ncations are confused, fumbling and scrappy. It is only after con-\nsiderable experience that clear and definite information is trans-\nmitted.\nWhen a novelist is writing a book he gradually builds up the\ncharacters in his mind until they become almost independent\nentities whose reactions in any situation will be consistent with\nthe psychological characteristics with which he has endowed them ;\nat least that is the ideal towards which he should strive. As a case\nin point, we have been told how Mrs Gamp used to speak to Dickens\nat all sort of odd moments. I imagine that a similar process takes\nplace in the mind of a biographer, only in such case the material\nfrom which the character is built up is derived from historical\nsources.\nI suggest that in the case of mediumistic communication some-\nthing of a very like nature occurs. In the mind either of the medium\nor the sitter a character is gradually built up and behaves in a\nmanner analogous to that in which the characters of the novelist\nor biographer behave. The greater the knowledge possessed by the\nsitter, derived either from his own memory or by telepathy from\nanother source, the nearer will the behaviour of this character\napproximate to good biography. Now if a good biographical char-\nacter of a deceased person be thus built up, we may reasonably\nexpect it to exhibit the motivation as well as the other types of\n\fJune 1933 Correspondence 89\nhabitual forms of thought and association of ideas peculiar to the\noriginal.\nIn the matter of the possibility of communication from the sur-\nviving consciousness of a deceased person, I preserve an open mind,\nI neither deny nor affirm, though perhaps I lean a little towards\nacceptance, but I think that there are many very serious difficulties\nin the way of regarding the ostensible communicator as being the\nsurvivor actually there, speaking either to the Control or directly\nthrough the Medium.\nI suggest, however, that where the \" biographical character\n\"\nwhich has been built up is a true and sympathetic portrait, telepathy\nfrom the survivor (if such exist) will be much facilitated owing to\nthe psychological parallelism existing between the two. It seems\nnot unreasonable to suppose that when there is already in existence\na familiar psychological structure the passage of telepathic messages\nwill be easier and distortion less liable to occur. I put forward this\nsuggestion in the rough as it seems to me that some of the difficulties\nexperienced in the interpretation and explanation of mediumistic\nphenomena may be resolved thereby, and in the hope that it may\nbe subjected to such criticism as may effectively destroy it, if\nvalueless or refine and amplify it if valuable.\nYours, etc.,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\nREVIEW.\nErnest Bozzano, Polyglot Mediumship (Xenoglossy). Translated\nby Isabel Emerson. 8vo, pp. 191. London : Rider and Co.,\n1932. Price 5s. net.\nThe term '\nXenoglossy \" was apparently first used by Prof.\nRichet to denote the phenomenon of speaking with tongues, and\nSignor E. Bozzano defines it as follows on page 57 of this book :\n\" By phenomena of xenoglossy we mean the cases in which the\nmedium not only speaks and writes in languages unknown to him,\nbut does so by making original observations, or conversing with\nthose present, thus proving that the phrases spoken were created\nfor the occasion.\" This book is a collection of thirty-five cases\nin which Signor Bozzano asserts that the phenomenon was exhi-\nbited, and which he divides into four categories, namely cases\nobtained by speaking automatism and clairaudient mediumship,\nby automatic writing, by the direct voice, and by direct writing.\nIncidentally, rather a curious position would appear to arise from\nthe inclusion of the last two categories, as it is usually claimed by\nbelievers in these two forms of mediumship that the speaking or\nwriting is certainly not done by the medium, in which case of course\nSignor Bozzano's definition would not apply.\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1933\nThe author considers that through this phenomenon of speaking\nwith tongues, the spirit-hypothesis is proved, and discusses and\ndismisses various alternatives, including cryptomnesia, telepathic\nclairvoyance, telesthesia (reading at a distance in closed books), and\nancestral memory.\nThe cases, which vary greatly in evidential value, are taken from\nmany different books and periodicals, ranging from the Proceedings\nof this Society to books by Mr Dennis Bradley and Mr Florizel Von\nReuter. They date from as far back as 1857 to 1931\n.\nThe case from our Proceedings is that from volume xvii, in which\na few words of Dutch were spoken in Dr van Eeden's sitting with\nMrs Thompson. This of course is included in the first category,\ntogether with (among others) the case of Laura Edmonds (taken at\nsecond-hand from Prof. Richet's Traite de Metapsychique) and that\nof Ninfa Filiberto, an account of which appeared in this Journal in\nDecember 1900. Ninfa Filiberto was said to speak fluent English\nduring phases of somnambulism, and to have conversed at length\nin that language (though having no normal knowledge of it), with\ntwo Englishmen. Signor Bozzano concludes his summary of this\ncase by stating that \" the English critic of the '\nJournal of the\nS.P.R.' . . . considers that the fact of the somnambulist who spoke\nEnglish fluently, is not sufficiently conclusive for lack of particulars,\n.\nseeing that her English dialogues were not written down \",\u2014with\nwhich criticism I heartily agree.\nAn interesting case in the second category (\" writing auto-\nmatism \") is that of Mrs Laura Finch, who wrote in Prof. Richet's\npresence about twenty lines of Greek, the sentences she wrote\nhaving afterwards been found to exist in print in various works..\nNevertheless the Greek phrases often corresponded to actual\ncircumstances and were used for giving appropriate replies to\nProf. Richet's questions.\nCase fourteen, taken from The Two Worlds of 19 June 1931,\nconcerns the medium Mrs Estelle Roberts, and seems to me doubt-\nful, to say the least, but is worthy of note as being the only example\ngiven of an English medium at present practising in London. The\nsitting, which was for the direct voice, took place on 30 January\n1931, in total darkness with eight sitters, among whom were a\nDutch father and son. No control of the medium is mentioned,\nbut the extract from The Two Worlds states that \"Red Cloud\"\n(Control) then announced that he had placed the right foot of the\nmedium on that of the sitter to the right, where it remained through-\nout the sitting (p. 71). Among other voices which manifested was.\none speaking in a foreign tongue, which the father and son recognised\nas being Dutch. After finding some difficulty in speaking, the\nCommunicator said he would write a message on the blackboard\n\fJune 1933 Review Itl\n(outside the circle), which was evidently at hand for use, and after\nthe close of the sitting a message was found there. Now Signor\nBozzano places this case in the second category (writing auto-\nmatism), thus implying that the medium wrote it herself automati-\ncally. But what was she doing outside the circle, and how, if her\nright foot was on that of the sitter to her right all the time, did she\nget there ?\nThe last two categories, direct voice and direct writing, might\nsurely have been omitted altogether, as the evidence for the latter\n(as a phenomenon in itself) is practically non-existent, and as\nexamples of \" xenoglossy \" in the former are nearly all taken from\nthe mediumship of George Valiantine, whose entire phenomena\nmust be held suspect.\nIn his conclusion the author considers the various hypotheses\nmentioned above and decides that the spirit-hypothesis is the only\none that fits the facts. There are, however, two hypotheses that\nSignor Bozzano scarcely seems to have taken into account at all,\nthose of fraud on the part of the medium and suggestibility on the\npart of the sitters. These two, however unattractive they are,\nhave surely as much right to be considered as the others.\nMrs Salter put much of the difficulty of estimating the evidence\nfor xenoglossy in a nutshell when she said in her paper \" The\nHistory of George Valiantine \" (Proc. S.P.R., xl), \"... It is very\nmuch easier to discover that a man does not know a language\nwhen he is pretending that he does, than to discover that he does\nknow it, when he is pretending that he does not.\"\nS. R.

This discussion is supported\nfurther on in the Bulletin (p. 45) by Illustrations of Illegitimate\nTypes of Controversy, mainly though not entirely quotations\nselected from one book. The principal article of the Bulletin is the\nsecond, entitled \" Impossible and Supernormal \". This begins with\nan amusing account of replies to an inquiry into opinions on the\npossibility under given conditions of an apparently impossible, but\nactually feasible and easy mechanical performance without trickery.\nDr Prince follows this illustration of misplaced incredulity with\naccounts given in more or less detail of forty cases in which the\nperformances of various mediums, having been described by in-\nvestigators as impossible by normal means (or similar words) were\nsubsequently shown to be actually done by trickery. Many other\ninstances could be given of similar credulity and Dr Prince's dis-\ncussion of the subject will be found interesting.\nSome notes on articles published elsewhere in relation to the pre-\nceding Bulletin XVIII will be found on pp. 40-5, and the present\nBulletin ends with a reply by Lord Charles Hope to certain criti-\ncisms in Bulletin XVIII on Mr Harry Price's experiments with\nRudi Schneider ; and with a short report by Mrs Hemenway of\nwhat seems to have been a striking sitting with Mrs Piper some\nsixteen years ago.\nE.

H. Salter in the Chair.\nMr Stephen Chant read a paper on \" Psychical Research and the\nWritten Word \", which is printed below, considerably abridged.\nProbably a large proportion of my listeners have at one time or\nanother enjoyed some practical experience of psychical research and\nit is certain that some at least have had very considerable experience\nof it. Now I have to my credit so very little that it is not worthy of\nmention ; so little that I am not qualified to discuss psychical re-\nsearch at all, except as a literature : and this I have to do before an\naudience who have arrived here as it were straight from the labora-\ntory. I can only hope that a merely bookish view is not entirely\nwithout interest.\nFor every research worker the time comes when, in making a\nwritten report of his labours, he goes one step further than the actual\nfacts ; when he reaches the implications of those facts ; collates\nthem or edits them ; when he betrays his own distinctive preconcep-\ntions, his unwitting beliefs or\u2014at the worst\u2014his inadvertent question-\nbegging ; when he tries to elucidate his material or to illustrate by\nmeans of it some favoured philosophic system ; then is the time when\nthe mere reader, if he bends his mind to it, may come into his own.\nI am not concerned with the whole body of the literature of\npsychical research. Let me limit myself to the more sober and\nrespectable part of the output on psychical research proper. I am\nimmediately struck by a difference between the more recent matter\nand all that went before it. This difference is a little hard to put\ninto words which will not bear an unfavourable implication. This is,\nhowever, due to the almost universal presumptions which give to\nsome neutral term a sound either derogatory or the reverse and\ndeprive one, if one is attacking these presumptions themselves, of\nthe very words with which one needs to do it. Put it, if the epithets\nwill not be misunderstood, that the work of a generation ago when\ncompared with the work of to-day has a most disarming appearance\nof simple-mindedness ; or say that it was then superficially more\namateurish and is now superficially more scientific, and you describe\na change which in a small way I cannot help but deplore. For such\nsimplicity, as it appears at first glance, does very commonly hide\na great deal more preliminary hard thinking than has preceded the\nwriting's of official psychologists.\nThere is no novelty in remarking that the whole history of science\ndisplays two great tendencies : (1) the experimental, that is, the\ntendency to record and to measure, and (2) the theoretical and\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1933\nabstract. It is precisely my case that the more impressive pieces of\npsychical research have always exemplified the first and are now\nincreasingly and regrettably showing signs of the second. The\ndelight in class names and abstract nouns is often excused on the\nground that they save circumlocution ; but they cannot be a sub-\nstitute for thought. One cannot get more out of words than one puts\ninto them.\nEvery field of human inquiry seems to have lent itself, even if\nsomewhat stubbornly, to those processes of abstraction which, in\none of its aspects at least, is science. Till now there has always\napparently been some set of qualities chosen more or less to taste\nwhich could be withdrawn from the complete wholes before us and\nbuilt into a skeleton or scheme, a kind of map of the objects of our\nstudies, bearing much the same relation to that object as a map\nitself bears to the undulating living stretch of forest, tilth and pasture\nwhich it represents. But in psychology we are no longer dealing\nwith the world without, but with the world within ; our problem is\nno longer objective, it is subjective ; we are not now attacking\nthings we can touch, see, weigh, taste, and measure, and so in the\nlast resort we have to accept what the victims of our inquiries tell us\nof their experiences and then argue as best we may about what we\nhave been told.\nIf a person becomes possessed of information in some fashion\nunintelligible to me, why must I invent a something inside him\nwhich did the trick and name that something \" cryptaesthesia \" ?\nMust there be a god in the machine to make the wheels go round ?\nHow are we any nearer to understanding the unintelligible by form-\ning names for imaginary causes ? And why is the \" secret \" or\n\" hidden feeling \" in Greek any less a confession of ignorance than\nsecond-sight in English or clairvoyance in French ? For myself, I\nwould rest quite content with the older names, finding little to\ngrumble at in \"ghosts\", \"phantoms\", \"second-sight\", \"clair-\nvoyance \", and the rest ; since they generally beg the question not\nmore\u2014as has often been asserted\u2014but less than many later coinages.\nAll that seems to me essential is that everyone should always re-\nmember that each name\u2014however quaint-sounding a collection of\nsyllables\u2014is merely a name for a set of events or happenings and\nnot the name of a separate something, a mysterious power which\ncan be advanced as the cause or explanation of these events. In the\nclassic example one must not suppose that glass can be seen through\nbecause it is transparent.\nIt is pretty generally admitted, and I would be the first to concur,\nthat the greatest achievement due to this Society has been the\ndemonstration that telepathic phenomena of all kinds do occasion-\nally but veritably occur. This, in itself, is a tremendous advance on\n\fJuly 1933 Private Meeting 101\nthe position two generations ago, and it is an advance we owe to\nthe earlier activities of the Society. Earlier members were, perhaps,\nfortunate in that mediiuns of the first rank at that time seem to have\nbeen predominantly mental and it is our misfortune that a difference\nin those available to-day seem to be turning the attention of psy-\nchical research workers all over the world towards physical pheno-\nmena. These are matters which, so far as their purely physical\nproblems are concerned, one may safely prophesy will be settled ;\nsince not only the technique of 200 years of physical and chemical\nexperiment, but the ideational technique of science as a whole\nprovides methods of attack. But it seems regrettable that the\nproblem of mental phenomena\u2014the two-fold problem, whether they\nhappen and how they happen\u2014already half solved, should not\nengage all the efforts of research until it is finally elucidated.\nThere has been no lack of fresh labours to consolidate the territory\nalready won, but we would, each of us, agree. I suppose, that all such\nhappenings remain as profoundly incomprehensible to-day as they\ndid twenty years ago. I hope it will have been observed that when,\njust now, I referred to telepathy, I did so by means of the expression\n\" telepathic phenomena of all kinds \". I intended not merely to\ncover by that phrase mediumistic communications ; for that these\nare telepathic in the proper sense of the word as Myers defined it is\nobvious. My intention was to avoid the implications which the\nword telepathy so often has to-day. I do not wish to deny that\nthere are such things as telepathic phenomena, but when we have\nrecorded a number of such cases to my mind telepathy is no more\nthan the word with which we head our list. It is the chapter-head\nto a chapter which contains accounts of a number of mysterious\nhappenings having sufficient points in common to allow of them\nbeing grouped together ; it is the title of a collection ; and this is\nwhat I mean when I say it is simply a summational term.\nWe are not, therefore, justified in using it for the name of a power\nor faculty, at least until we have isolated and experimented with a\npower able to produce the phenomena. Such a power has never\nbeen isolated ;\nindeed, many of the characteristics of the phenomena\nmake the existence of such a power improbable. We are not, while\nthis is the case, even justified in imagining that such a power may be\npossessed by anyone. Yet, since we do so, we are saved the labour\nof searching for a cause more consistent with the nature of our\nmaterial and so the second part of the problem, how these things\nhappen, remains very much where it has been for many years.\nWe know nothing of the causes of all kinds of telepathy ; not even\nwhether they be one or many. That the cause should be, as is often\nassumed, some kind of faculty possessed by the persons to whom\nthese events occur seems to me very improbable to say the least.\ng2\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1933\nThe statistical experiments lately undertaken by certain members\nof this Society have demonstrated pretty conclusively that there is\nno such faculty shared by all and sundry to any perceptible degree.\nNow, we are all, from the bodily point of view, of the same genus ;\nno one of us is the happy possessor of an organ not shared by the\nrest, and it is surely not excessive to suppose that our minds have a\nsimilar likeness. Differences of degree there certainly are\u2014even\nenormous differences of degree\u2014but we should not expect a flat\ndifference of kind whereby one could produce examples of telepathy,\nand another no such thing even to the smallest extent.\nIt is extraordinary that such things should come to a few of us for\na short time and, after we have briefly experimented, should fade\naway not to return ; that to quite a number of others they should\ncome but once in a lifetime ; that to the vast majority they should\ncome not at all ; and that\u2014as we know when through a medium we\n\" consult the dead upon the things that were \", they come to a very\nvery few as part of the everyday business of life. This does not\nsquare with the notion of a faculty ; it does not even square very\nwell with the notion of a Cosmic Consciousness, or why such in-\nconstancy of access to its reservoirs ? It is almost as if telepathy\nwere an event that happened to people or due to something done to,\nor for them, rather than due to something they themselves did. It is\nalmost as if you caught telepathy roughly as you catch a cold, and\nalso as if most of us were immunised from birth.\nAs I have said there cannot, for our present needs, be too much\nhypothesis-making, and it seems to me that any person who has had\nexperiences leading them to form a new guess at the modus operandi\nhas a plain duty to give it what publicity he or she can.\nA discussion followed, in which Miss Reutiner, Dr E. J. Ding-\nwall, the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas, Mr J. Hettinger, Mr G. W. Fisk,\nand Mr W. H. Salter took part.\nNOTES ON SITTINGS.\nBy Illit Grondahl.\nThe following is an account of a series of sittings with the Norwegian\nmedium Fru Sophie Wereide and with the English medium Mrs\nOsborne Leonard. A full report has been deposited with the\nS.P.R., but I should like to emphasize and enlarge a little on the\npoints that to me seem the most significant.\nMy mother died suddenly in her 72nd year on 15 January 1927,\nmy father after about a year's illness on 31 March of the same year.\nOn 5 April I had a table and planchette-sitting with Dr Th. Wereide,\nReader in Physics at the University of Oslo, and his wife, Fru\n\fJuly 1933 Notes on Sittings 103\nSophie Wereide, who is a non-professional medium. We sat in the\nusual way round a small varnished wooden three-legged table, which\nimmediately began tilting out the following (in English) :\n\" Illit your parents hand in hand with wandering steps and slow\nthrough our silence to[From this point the planchette was used, all\nthree resting a hand on the planchette]ok their wandering way. 1\nDon't call them back they [sic] happy ones that have fullfilled [sic]\ntheir shadow lives. (Question : Who is communicating ?) Your\nold friend D. H., Your earlier guide in this, of course \". D. H. had\nfrequently appeared with communications, in English, to the\nWereides.\nD. H. here continued in Norwegian, dissuading one from seeking\nthe departed in this way\u2014by mechanical means\u2014because it binds\nthem to the \" shadows \", their \" doubles \", and recommending\n\" spiritual experience \".\nTrying again with the table, the movements were jerky, as\nthough impatient, and we were told, in Norwegian :\n\" No, do not\ntear at the veil. (Question : Who is speaking 1) Annabetha.\"\nAfter this the small table waltzed about under our hands and fell\nover.\nAt a sitting with Dr and Mrs Wereide on 20 April, in which my\nsister Mrs Birgit Grondahl Bekker also took part, a communicator\nG. M. J. styled himself \" the old dean \" and thereby clearly identified\nhimself as Gustav M. J., a prominent divine in Norway, who died\nsome years ago. He referred to an incident in the life of my father\n\u2014his presence at the opening of a Scandinavian Seamen's Church\nat Liverpool (1 December 1884)\u2014which was then unknown to me\nand which I was afterwards able to verify from the records of the\nNorwegian Seamen's Mission of which my father was pastor in\nLondon 1881-1894.\nMy subsequent planchette sittings with the Wereides have been\nmarked by the insistent appearance of a late professor of History\nand Ethnography, under whom I studied some 20 years previously,\nand of my father's only sister. It is the latter personality, who by\nher continual appearance, in connection with names of relatives\npartly dead and partly still living, seems to me to constitute the\ncentre of interest in the following sittings, and especially by per-\nsisting\u2014in the same associations\u2014under the mediumship of Mrs\nOsborne Leonard.\nLater in April 1927\u2014with the same sitters\u2014the following was\nspelt out through the planchette (in Norwegian) :\n\" Johannes is\nmore ill than his nearest are aware of. Anna. He is mostly con-\n1\nIt was only a year and a half later that I recognized this as a modified\nquotation of the last lines in Paradise Lost.\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1933\ncerned about Kristoffer : he is not suited to be more alone than\nhe already is \". There were at the time two of my relatives by\nname Johannes who were ill, and I thought first of my uncle\nJohannes\u2014my father's brother\u2014who was about to have an opera-\ntion on his leg. But the planchette continued :\n\" You are on\nthe wrong track with regard to the identity of Johannes. Julie.\"\nA cousin of mine, Johannes, was ill at the time, and it became clear\nfrom the connection that he was the person thought of. His\nbrother Kristoffer (or Christopher) was becoming increasingly deaf\nand \" more alone \". His wife Julie died at the birth of their only\nchild, a daughter, in 1916. [\" Julie \" was mentioned by Mrs\nBrittain in trance, 7 April 1919.] A planchette-sitting with Dr\nand Mrs Wereide at my brother-in-law's and sister's flat 14 January\n1928 opened with the words :\n\" Julie does not come in this way.\nIt will be difficult, a difficult time for Kristoffer. He has tendencies\nto isolation also. Anna.\"\nOn 10 May 1928 I had a sitting with Mrs Osborne Leonard. At\nan earlier sitting with Mrs Leonard, 11 October 1927 (when my\nname was not given), nothing recognizable occurred except the\nname Anna. This was also the case during the first half of my\nsecond sitting, when the name Margaret and Anna cropped up in\nconnection with Johannes. Particular significance was added by\nthe declaration that \" Mrs Grethe wanted to give that name in\nthe writing \". Grethe was the name by which my father's only\nsister, christened Anna Margrethe\u2014the mother of Johannes and\nChristopher\u2014was known. Further the name Borger was men-\ntioned in connection with her, Borger being Grethe's and my father's\nelder brother, who died in March 1927. Grethe, who had in her\nlarge and hospitable house outside Christiania been a kind of social\ncentre of the larger Grondahl family, died about 60 years of age\nin the late autumn of 1909. A very fair though brief description\nof her house and the view from it over a bay \" like the mouth\nof a river, flowing in from the sea, like a basin, a kind of town and\nships coming up \" formed the conclusion of my second, and to me\nmost interesting, sitting with Mrs Osborne Leonard. The signi-\nficance of it is much enhanced by its position as an interpolation\nin the series of the Wereide sittings. That (Mar)grethe, who has\nconstantly occurred in connection with her still living sons Johannes\nand Christopher at the Wereide sittings, should appear in connection\nwith Johannes and her brother Borger at the Osborne Leonard\nsitting seemed to me to constitute at least a small psychic case,\nworthy of being followed up.\n\fJuly 1933 Notes on Sittings 105\nTHE INVESTIGATIONS OF ROBERT CHAMBERS.\nThe name of Robert Chambers (1802-71) is well known as that of a\nmember of the publishing firm of W. and R. Chambers. He was\nthe author or compiler of many works of a semi-popular nature, and\nhe also acquired some reputation as a geologist, and in particular as\nthe author of the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1813-6).\nHe is known to have interested himself towards the end of his life\nin the subject of spiritualism, which was then at the height of its\npopularity in England. Curiosity has consequently been felt as to\nthe nature of the material referred to in the Dictionary of National\nBiography, the writer in which states that among Chambers's\n\" unpublished works are an extensive inquiry into spiritualistic and\npsychical research. . .\n.\"\nBy the kindness of Mrs Edward Fitzgerald, one of Robert Cham-\nbers's granddaughters, and of Mr Trethewy, who acted as inter-\nmediary, four documents in Robert Chambers's hand and relating\nto his researches into supernormal phenomena, have come into the\nSociety's possession as a much appreciated gift from Mrs Fitzgerald.\nThese documents, which probably form a part or perhaps even the\nwhole of the works alluded to in D.N.B., are as follows :\n1. A report dated 9 May 1853 of a sitting on the previous evening\nwith Mrs Hayden, during which spirit-cornmumcations were\nreceived by means of raps. This lady had arrived in England a\nfew months earlier and was the first medium to give sittings in\nthis country.\n2. A diary kept during 2-23 May 1855, consisting largely of accounts\nof sittings for raps and the like with a Miss Powell. This diary also\nrecords conversations with Mrs De Morgan and with Sir Edward\nBulwer Lytton (afterwards Baron Lytton). The latter, among\nother things, is reported to have described his \" intercourse with a\nMr Hume, a young man from America, but of Scottish extraction\n\u2014\nwhose family, he says, had some gift of the second sight. Mr Hume\nis a medium of extraordinary power\u2014if power be the right word to\nuse in the case. At Nebworth [sic for Knebworth] where Sir E.\nhad him on a visit, he caused a table to rise off the floor, and a\nguitar placed below a table where the party was seated, was touched\nby an invisible hand. He also caused an invisible hand to touch the\nindividuals in the company. Sir Edward is assured that the ghostly\nhand is even in some circumstances made visible, as proceeding from\nthe muffled up arm of one of the party.\" The meaning of the last\nsentence is obscure.\n3. A long account of a sitting with D. D. Home on 21 May 1860.\nThis is reproduced below.\n4. A fairly long diary, kept during a visit to the United States,\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1933\n22 September- 16 October 1860. The following mediums are\nreferred to, chiefly from personal investigation : J. R. Newton\n(pp. 4, 16-24), a healing medium ; Mrs Conant (pp. 4-5, 24), a trance\nmedium ; J. V. Mansfield (pp. 5-12), a billet-reader, of whom\nRobert Chambers says that \" he has been exclusively occupied\ngiving responses to sealed notes, charging a dollar for each.\nHe has now read about 120,000 \" [in eight years, making\nover forty a day!].; Lizzie Doten (pp. 15-17), a trance medium;\nMrs French (pp. 25-7), a medical clairvoyante ; the well-\nknown medium Charles Foster (pp. 28-46), whose versatile\nphenomena included raps, skin-writing, billet-reading, and various\nphysical phenomena ; one Colchester (pp. 46-8), another billet-\nreader, whom Chambers suspected, and whose phenomena led him\nto wonder about Foster ; Mrs Staats (pp. 49-52), a spirit-seer ;\nHenry C. Gordon (pp. 56-62, 64-7), who used a kind of planchette\nand produced physical phenomena ; a blind medium called Paist\n(pp. 62-4), who \" can even drive a carriage\u2014by the help of the\nspiritual sight or seership \" ; Laura Edmonds, the daughter of\nJudge Edmonds (pp. 68-74), with whom he had a conversation only ;\nand finally Katherine Fox and Mrs Underhill (pp. 74-8), two of the\nFox sisters, who showed him various physical phenomena. In this\ndiary Robert Chambers also describes an apparition seen by Dr\nJoseph G. Gogswell (pp. 52-6).\nThese documents clearly contain material of much historical\ninterest to psychical research, and students of the subject are much\nindebted to Mrs Fitzgerald for having so generously presented them\nto the Society.\n^ -g\nA Sitting with D. D. Home in 1860.\n[The most interesting of the papers by Robert Chambers, pre-\nsented to the Society by his grand-daughter Mrs Edward Fitzgerald,\nis undoubtedly his detailed account of a sitting with D. D. Home,\nwhich is reproduced in full below. The sitting was held in Mrs\nMilner Gibson's house, and it will be seen that the report dates from\nthe day after the sitting. This particular sitting does not appear\nto have been previously reported, unless it can be identified, as\nseems not improbable, with the sitting described by Robert Bell\nin his Cornhill article of August 1860 and afterwards by Dr Gully.\n(It is characteristic of the records of this period that it should be\nimpossible to determine with certainty, from a comparison of two\nindependent records, whether or not they relate to the same sitting.)\nFor sittings in the same place at about the same time, see, for instance,\nD. D. Home, Incidents in my Life 2\n(1864), pp. 141 ff., and Mme\nHome, D. D. Home, his Life and Mission (1888), pp. 137 ff., and\n\fJuly 1933 Notes on Sittings 107\nThe Gift ofD. D. Home (1890), pp. 143 ff. The Society's D. D. Home\nCollection contains a number of letters to Home from both Sirs\nMilner Gibson and Robert Chambers. These show that the former\nwas on terms of the closest friendship with Home ; and that\nthe latter, though never so close an intimate, was in friendly\ncorrespondence with him. Not long before the sitting, for instance,\non 7 March 1860, Chambers wrote to Home to ask him, on behalf of\na Miss Douglas, to wear a pair of gloves for a short time and then to\nreturn them.\nThis account is printed for its historical interest, and no attempt is\nmade critically to evaluate it. Ed.]\nOn the evening of the 21st May 1860, at Mrs Milner Gibson's house,\nNo. 3 Hyde Park Terrace, 1\na small party met to witness some of the\nphenomena alleged to be produced under an influence which attends\nMr D. D. Hume. The party sat down at a round table in the back\ndrawing-room, which was well heated and lighted. At Mr Hume's\nleft hand was Mrs Milner Gibson ; next her, Lady Shelley ;\nthen,\nin succession, Mrs R. Chambers, Dr Gully, Mr Robert Bell, Mr R.\nChambers, Mademoiselle Gallere,2\nand Sir Ashurst ;\nbeing nine\npersons in all. All having placed their hands on the table, knockings\nwere soon heard at different parts of the surface, some in a different\ntone and force from others. The table also tilted in various direc-\ntions ; slid laterally several times ; and finally rose about a foot into\nthe air, but quickly came down again. In the course of the evening,\nit rose in the same way five or six times ; on one occasion, fully\neighteen inches. Mr Hume told us that if we could have sat quite\nstill when the table rose, it would have continued longer off the\nground. We almost unavoidably shifted back a little to allow it\nfreedom of motion and clear ourselves of it ; and this, he said,\ninterfered with or marred the influence at work. It may be re-\nmarked that, while one person could doubtless have tilted up the\ntable a little on one side with hand or foot, there was no visible means\nof raising it equably on all sides to such a height, unless most of the\ncompany had combined to raise it, the fact being that all sat\nperfectly still, with their hands laid lightly on the surface, where no\nsuch agency of course could be exercised.\nAmongst the earliest particulars observed was a trembling of the\ntable, which gradually extended to the floor and consequently to\nthe chairs on which we were seated. All declared themselves\nsensible of this tremulation of the floor and chairs. There was also\n1\n[Sic, read Hyde Park Place.]\n2\n[This name is spelt Galeer \" in Mme Home's The Gift of D. D. Home\n(1890), p. 143.]\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, July 1933\nat this early stage a general experience of the gentle blowing of a\ncool aura ; the more remarkable as the room was very warm.\nAfter perhaps half an hour spent in listening to rappings, &c.\nMrs Milner Gibson asked in an endearing tone if \" Nolly \" was\npresent, meaning the spirit of a son of hers not long ago deceased at\neight years old. Taking a twice-round black-bead bracelet from her\narm, and holding it half under the cover of the table, she asked if\nNolly would take it from her ; and presently it was taken away\nfrom her, and carried about under the table, rattling, slapping\non the fluted pillar, and dancing about, as if some playful child were\namusing himself with it. Finally, it was laid on a sofa behind the\ncompany, on the side farthest away from Mrs Milner Gibson.\nActing under directions from Mr Hume, Mrs Chambers held a\nhand-bell half under the hanging table-cover, and it was in like\nmanner taken out of her hand, and carried round under the table\nringing ; all hands keeping meanwhile on the surface, as before.\nThe spirit was asked to bring the bell to Mr Chambers, who presently\nputting his right hand under the table received it, as from an\nintelligent messenger, and brought it up to the surface. He then\nheld it under the table cover again, and asked that it might be taken\nfrom his hand ; and presently it was received and carried off. The\nspirit was asked to give back the bell to Mrs Chambers, and she soon\nfelt it at her knees ; but she failed to receive it rightly into her\nhand, and it was heard to fall with a clash upon the floor.\nThe end of the room formed a bow, with three windows, all\nclosed and curtained. The curtain of the central window being\nnow opened, and the lights all put out, we had the table removed\nclose to the recess, and all sat down again as before, excepting that\nthe part towards the recess was empty, Mr Ashurst having for this\nreason to take a seat behind Lady Shelley. The faint light which\ncame through the window from the sky was presently lessened by\nthe slow descent under invisible agency of the blind ; after which\nwe might be said to be sitting in the dark. It was now expected\nthat spiritual hands would become visible between the table and\nrecess ; but we were warned against expecting any such thing too\nintently, as such expectations were apt to mar the influence.\nWe were at the same time desired to go on chatting, however gaily,\nas remarkable phenomena were most likely to take place under such\ncircumstances. No one besides Mr Hume professed to see any\nspiritual hand during the evening ;\nbut, while we continued seated\nat the window, the sense of touch repeatedly bore witness to the\npresence of what were understood to be spiritual hands. I was\nfrequently touched by what seemed to be a hand, both pattingly on\nthe front of the leg, and with the palm laid on the knee.\nMrs Chambers asked if the spirit of her child Margaret was\n\fJuly 1933 Notes on Sittings 109\npresent, and received an answer in the affirmative, expressed in the\nusual manner by three raps on the table. She asked if the spirit\nwould touch her, and presently she felt a couple of little hands\nfondling her knees, scratching on her moire silk dress, and patting\nbehind the hanging table cover. A communication was spelt out\nby the alphabet (conducted by Mr Hume), to the effect, \" My dear\nmother, I am near you.\" On a suggestion by Mr Hume, Mrs\nChambers enveloped her hand in her handkerchief, and held it under\nthe table, with a request that the spirit would take it. She felt as\nif a dog's nose touched her hand, and presently the handkerchief\nwas drawn away from her. Mr Hume declared he saw it thrown\nacross the table behind Mr Chambers, and there it was immediately\nafter found on the floor by Mr Ashurst. It was impossible for Mr\nHume to have dropped it close behind one thus sitting on the\nopposite side of the table. Mr Chambers then took the same means\nfor having the same experience, but found, instead of a child's hand,\na man's, which, after a vain effort on his part to grasp it, withdrew.\nA communication by the alphabet explained that this was his\nfather's spirit. On a second time putting forward his hand within\nthe handkerchief, the seeming hand came forward, nibbled at it a\nlittle, till it seemed to get a sufficient hold of the handkerchief, then\ndrew off the handkerchief, which was next instant thrown in Mrs\nChambers's face. In the course of these experiments, Mrs Chambers\nfelt a hand placed upon her head thrice at intervals.\nNow and then in the course of the evening, the accordion was\nheld by Mr Hume with one hand under the table, and tunes were\nplayed upon it by invisible agency. While light lasted, we could\nsee his one hand lying on the table, as the other held the instrument\nby the valve end, with the keys hanging downwards. It was then\nclearly impossible that he could be the player. Mr Chambers held\nit for a short time, during which a few bars of tunes were played.\nAt a subsequent stage, while the instrument lay on the floor in the\nrecess of the window, it was played on without any one holding it,\ngiving forth the most beautiful strains imaginable, such as I could\nhardly suppose producible by any mortal musician. On my asking\nif the spirit of my father would play some of his favourite airs, the\nhigh notes were called into play, as in imitation of a quick tune\non the flute, which was his instrument. The accordion several times\nwas pushed up in the recess till it came and lay upon the table.\nAfterwards, it seemed to be carried entirely away from amongst us,\nand on our asking where it was, it was heard to give out a few notes\nfrom a point high in the air at a distant part of the room, as in\nanswer to our enquiry. I may remark that amongst the strains\nwhich issued from it in its independent evolutions, there were some\nof the finest attenuation, as we thought\u2014so fine, as to recall to me\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1933\nthe Shakespearian expression \" nought lives 'twixt it and silence \"\n;\nyet after an interval these were followed by an echo finer still, yet\ndistinctly audible. On one occasion, there was a second echo\u2014an\necho of an echo, as it were.\nWe had now sat for about three hours. Latterly, the curtains of\nthe one open window were drawn by invisible agency close together,\nso as to produce perfect darkness ; but now these were in the same\nmysterious manner opened, so as to allow of our seeing the dim\nblind. Mr Hume rose and told us that a hand had taken his and\nwas leading him into the middle of the room. Presently we heard\nhim speaking there. \" Oh,\" said he, \" they are raising me up off\nthe ground.\" Amidst breathless wonder, we heard him during the\nnext two or three minutes speaking from midway up to the ceiling,\nand so apparently getting carried about through the room, till he\nseemed to be brought over us, and placed on the table, where I felt\nhis feet and legs. The missing accordion came into his grasp as he\nsailed about, and played beautifully ;\nafterwards, it was disengaged\nfrom him, and went about of itself, playing music that seemed to\nme quite heavenly. After he had rested a minute on the table,\nhe was raised again, but not high, and we saw him crossing in front\nof the dim light. I then felt his feet resting on my shoulders, with\nabout a third or fourth of his natural weight, so as not to be in the\nleast inconvenient to me ; and next minute or so he alighted gently\non the sofa behind me. It was of course to be regretted that we\ncould not see his figure fairly suspended in the air ; but beyond\nquestion no one could have come upon the table by ordinary means\nwithout disturbing some one of our close circle, and so being detected\nin imposture. We were not left the least room to doubt that he was\ncarried through the air and let down upon the table.\nThe only remaining manifestation was one very interesting to\nMrs Chambers. A communication from her child spirit came as an\nenquiry, \" May Margaret break the roses ?\n\" referring, it was under-\nstood^] to a rose-bush with two blown roses upon it, which stood\non a stand at one of the side windows. Mrs Milner Gibson gave a\ncordial assent, and immediately some of the company heard a rose\nbroken off, and this was next instant placed on Mrs Chambers's\nshoulder. The same spirit asked leave to make a hole in her\nmother's lace cuff, and on leave being granted Mrs Chambers felt a\ncouple of little hands working at her lace, in which a small gap was\nmade at the edge.\nIt was now midnight, and most of the company were beginning\nto feel weary. It seemed to be quite a proper time that the spirits\nproposed to give us a good night on the accordion. With a beautiful\nlullaby-like air, the proceedings closed.\nLondon, May 22, 1860.\n\fJuly 1933 Correspondence 111\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThe Spirit-Photographer William Hope.\nTo the Editor of The, Journal.\nSir, \u2014Since the publication in Proceedings of the \" Report of an\nInvestigation into Spirit-Photography \" by Major W. Rampling\nRose and myself, further evidence in regard to this matter is available\nwhich it is perhaps advisable to place on record.\nOn one or two occasions Mr William Hope asked me to obtain for\nhim a chemical known as calcium sulphide. This I thought he\nwanted for painting a seance trumpet or the like. A month or so ago,\non going through some of Hope's correspondence, I was surprised to\ndiscover a letter to me from his private address at Oakley Street,\nCrewe. Almost without exception Hope's letters were addressed\nfrom 144 Market Street, Crewe, the home of Mrs Buxton. This\nparticular letter, among other things, contained the following\nrequest\n:\n\" Will you paint me a card with that luminous paint. Give it a\ncoat or two and let me have it this week if you can, or tell me where\nI can get it for I cannot get it in Crewe. We are due at the College\nnext week. Let me have the card early and I will do as much for you\nsome day. Write me to my own address which is, 50 Oakley Street,\nCrewe.\"\nIn my enlightened frame of mind, it occurred to me that he\nwanted this sent to Oakley Street so that Mrs Buxton would know\nnothing of it and that he perhaps wanted it to prepare a stock of\nextras for his visit to London. I immediately tried this luminous\npaint and was surprised at the result. I do not for a moment suggest\nthat Hope used it for all his fakes\u2014he had doubtless many methods\n\u2014\nbut an examination shows that he could have used it for numerous\neffects. All one has to do is to paint a little of this on a small\npositive (or place the positive in front of a card that has been\npainted), press it in contact with the surface of the plate and it gives\na perfect image. A small flash light can be hidden in the pocket and\nif the luminous positives are enlivened by this a few minutes before\nthey are used, they are sufficiently actinic to print an image instan-\ntaneously. Calcium sulphide is economical, safe and simple, and the\nirony of it all is that I provided Hope myself with sufficient of this\nstuff to fake thousands of extras. Both the \" sitter \" and the\n\" extras \" on the illustration herewith, were printed on the photo-\ngraphic plate by means of luminous paint.\nIn my paper, as originally read, I referred to a discovery of fake\nmaterials in Hope's bag but did not then feel at liberty to give any\ndetails. Mrs Barbara McKenzie in the issue of Light dated 2 June\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1933\nlast, has now made public the fact that while at the British College\nher husband, Mr Hewat McKenzie, made a secret examination of\nHope's bag and found in it a flash lamp with bulb attachment, some\ncut out photographic heads and some hair. In a discussion after the\ndiscovery, Mr McKenzie and myself were in no doubt whatever that\nHope had been using similar apparatus for the production of his\nresults, although Mr McKenzie was still definitely of the opinion\nthat Hope had at times produced genuine psychic effects.\nMr McKenzie's suspicions were aroused by the fact that after the\nPrice-Hope case of 1922, all the extras secured by Hope at the\nBritish College, on their specially marked plates, were of the\n\" switch \" or flash-light type. The use of a flash lamp had been\ndiscussed on many occasions and it was to settle his doubts that Mr\nMcKenzie made an examination of Hope's bag. Certain other events\nhad tended to increase Mr McKenzie's suspicions, such as the fact\nthat Hope's bag was always locked and specially placed. My view\nis that it was only right for this examination to have been made and\nfor the facts to be placed before the public.\nIt would appear from my discussion with some of Hope's most\nstrenuous supporters that even they believe he deceived. My own\nconsidered opinion is that in no single instance did I obtain with\nHope a genuine psychic effect.\nYours, etc.,\nFeed Barlow.\nREVIEWS\nT. Brailsford Robertson, Ph.D., D.Sc, A Note Book. 8vo,pp. viii.\n39, 2 ill. Adelaide : The Hassell Press, 1932.\nThis little book consists of notes made by the late Prof. T. B.\nRobertson, in which he recorded for his own use certain experiences\nand certain speculations to which they had given rise in his mind.\nProf. Robertson, who was a bio-chemist of distinction and the author\nof The Physical Chemistry of the Proteins (1912), The Principles of\nBio-Chemistry (1918), and The Chemical Basis of Growth and Sene-\nscence (1923), died in January 1930 at the age of forty-five. This\nnote-book is now published by his wife, Mrs Jane W. Robertson.\nThe book is divided into three parts. The second, which deals\nwith a visit to Pavlov's laboratory in St Petersburg in 1914, is of no\nspecial interest from the point of view of psychical research. The\nfirst records eight cases of apparent telepathy, mostly between\nProf. Robertson and his wife, which took place in the latter part of\n1913 and the earlier part of 1914. None of them separately is par-\nticularly striking, but Prof. Robertson says in Part III that the\ncontinual accumulation of such experiences persuaded him that\n\fBoth the figure and the \" extras \" were produced by\ncontact with a luminous positive.\n\f\fJuly 1933 Rev lews 113\ntelepathy is a fact. Sometimes these coincidences would occur\nalmost hourly for days at a time, and then weeks would elapse\nwithout an instance being noticed.\nIn connection with these apparently telepathic phenomena, Prof.\nRobertson generally recorded the train of thought in his own mind\nwhich had led up to his share in the coincidence. Unfortunately in\nmost cases he did not investigate, or at any rate did not record, the\ntrain of thought in Mrs Robertson's mind which had led up to her\nshare in the coincidence.\nIn Part III Prof. Robertson states that repeated personal ex-\nperience has convinced him that premonition, as well as telepathy,\nis a fact. His account of his own premonitory experiences is ex-\ntremely interesting. They always took place during sleep, and they\nwere nearly always forewarnings of disagreeable events. The few\nexceptions to the latter rule were, he says, \"of an indescribably\ndifferent character.\" The events foreseen were of three kinds, viz.\n(a) trivial personal misfortunes, (b) serious personal dangers, and\n(c) public disasters. The previsions of serious events, both private\nand public, were a combination of two radically different kinds of\nexperience. One of these was a vague foreboding of danger or\ndisaster ; the other was an extremely vivid visual image of certain\ndetails in the future situation. Prof. Robertson's statements are not\nabsolutely unambiguous, but I understand him to say that the vague\nforeboding and the definite visual image would both recur many\ntimes and would not necessarily be connected by him. But finally a\nsituation would arise which was dangerous or disastrous, and in\nwhich there was some outstanding detail of a quite characteristic\nkind corresponding to the visual image. Afterwards this visual\nimage would not recur. He makes the important remark that the\nemotional tone (apprehension, anger, etc.) of his premonitions was\nproportional, not to the objective danger or inconvenience of the\nforeseen event, but to the degree of emotion which the latter aroused\nin him when it actually took place. Thus the prevision of an event\nwhich was not really dangerous, but which aroused great fear when\nit happened, would be an experience of strong apprehension. And\nthe prevision of an event which was really dangerous, but which\naroused no great fear when it happened, would be an emotionally\nunimpressive experience. The vividness of visual factor was,\nhowever, quite independent of these conditions.\nTwo interesting examples are given. One was an apprehension\nof grave personal danger associated with a vivid visual image of a\nlong strip of sand and a struggle to escape from something. In\nSeptember 1915 he nearly lost his life while bathing at Bolinas,\nCalifornia ; and he identified the visual image with the sand-pit at\nBolinas. Just before starting for Bolinas he had handed a folded\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1933\npaper to Mrs Robertson, asking her not to read it till they had re-\nturned. She put it into a sealed envelope. After the adventure she\nread it, and found that he had written that they would both be in\ngreat danger at Bolinas, and would nearly lose their lives. Mrs\nRobertson was swimming with him when he was nearly drowned by\na strong current, though it is not quite clear from her statement that\nthey were both in danger.\nThe other example refers to the war of 1914 to 1918. He had had\nan intense and prolonged but vague premonition of impending public\ndisaster, accompanied by a vivid visual image of the arrival of an\narmy at a certain village. And, in connection with this visual\nimage, he had a terrifying impression of \" absolutely ruthless and\nbrutal assertion of power \". He claims that he afterwards identified\nhis visual image with photographs of Dinant. He admits that he\nhad not beforehand connected the vague presentiment of public\ndisaster with the vivid visual image. This being so, it would seem\nthat the only part of the story which is of much importance as\nevidence for prevision is the identification of the vivid visual image\nof a town being entered by a hostile army with the photographs of\nDinant. The vague expectation of a great public disaster may well\nhave been quite irrelevant. For Prof. Robertson was constantly\nhaving vague apprehensions of unpleasant events, and the contem-\nporary political situation in 1914 was (and has been ever since) such\nas to provide ample cause for apprehending grave public disaster in\nthe near future.\nAccepting telepathy and prevision as facts, Prof. Robertson\nmade and recorded certain speculations to account for them. These\nare too briefly stated to be easily grasped or profitably discussed in\ndetail. He appears to have held that the physiological basis of\ntelepathic experiences is oxidation-processes in the brain ;\nthat such\na process in one brain can set up a corresponding process in another\nbrain by some kind of disturbance which travels through an inter-\nvening medium ; that we might discover the nature of these\nchemical processes, and make artificial chemical systems in which\nthey could be induced ; and that such artificial systems could then\nbe used to record and to experiment with the telepathic influence.\nHe had proposed to carry out experiments on these lines, but he\nwould appear not to have done so. It is difficult to see that this\nsuggestion, even if it were found to be useful as a hypothesis for\nguiding investigations on telepathy, could throw any light on\nprevision.\nC. D. Broad.\n\fJuly 1933 Rev lews 115\nA. Von Schrenck-Notzing, Die Entwicklung des Okhdtismus zur\nParapsychologie in Deutschland. 8vo, pp. 124. Leipzig\n:\nVerlag 0. Mutze, 1932.\nThe present work has been published by his widow from Schrenck-\nNotzing's literary remains. It was his aim to survey in it the\ndevelopment of psychical research in Germany since 1882, the\nyear of the foundation of the S.P.R. and of the death of Zollner.\nSchrenck-Notzing was of the opinion that the appearance of Pro-\nfessors Driesch and Oesterreich as supporters of psychical research\nmarked the taking by psychical research of its place in official\nscience (p. 24). I agree that official science will never again wholly\nignore the study of supernormal phenomena, but serious setbacks\nmay yet occur ; for more than once famous University Professors,\nsuch as Fechner and Weber, and earlier Fichte and Eschenmayer,\npronounced themselves in favour of the genuineness of these pheno-\nmena, without thereby causing psychical research to become an\nofficially recognised department of science.\nSchrenck's book falls into several parts. He deals first of all with\nthe investigation of paraphysical phenomena and with the con-\ntroversies aroused by them ; then he discusses the parapsychical\nphenomena and finally hauntings. He deals in detail with the\ncriticisms of opponents, and it must be recognised that in doing so\nhe adopts a courteous tone (pp. 75-6) and expressly dissociates him-\nself from the polemical manners of Professor Schroder. Schrenck\nadmits that the critical works of Lehmann, Dessoir and Moll (p. 69)\ngreatly contributed to the scientific advancement of our subject, in\nthat they impressed on psychical researchers the necessity for a\nmore thorough examination of sources of error, for the improvement\nof method of investigation, and for greater reserve in the theoretical\ntreatment of the results obtained.\nIn a substantial section are described the works which discuss our\nsubject theoretically and philosophically, in particular the works of\nDacque and Mattiesen, and finally Schrenck discusses the attitude\ntowards psychical research of both Roman Catholic and Protestant\ntheologians. The book discusses foreign investigations only in so far\nas they are known in Germany by translations or exhaustive reviews.\nOn the whole the book is a readable survey of the most important\nexperiments and theoretical discussions ; a vivid impression is given\nof many little-known works, Schrenck's exposition gaining from the\nfact that he personally knew not only contemporary investigators,\nbut also such earlier writers as Du Prel, Hellenbach, and Eduard\nvon Hartmann. Schrenck describes himself as in a sense a pupil of\nDu Prel (p. 6), but he differed from him in supporting a more strictly\nscientific procedure ; in the campaign of Hartmann against the\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1933\nspiritualists, Aksakov and Du Prel, he supported Hartmann in his\nanimistic interpretation of supernormal phenomena.\nA considerable amount of space is naturally taken up by the\ndescription and defence of Schrenck's own investigations ;\nthis is\nquite proper, since nothing would remain in Germany in the field\nof paraphysical phenomena if Schrenck's results had to be put aside.\nIn his efforts to find ever new support for his own results Schrenck-\nNotzing does not hesitate to put forward highly doubtful investiga-\ntions, such as those of Dr Schwab with the Berlin medium Frau\nVollhardt (p. 63). He is also of the opinion that Dr Imoda's in-\nvestigations of Linda Gazerra (p. 14) marked an important advance\nin the investigation of paraphysical mediumship, although elsewhere\nhe had written of them {Psych. Stud., 1912, p. 172), that \" the\ndamage which is done by such unsatisfactory publications is very\ngreat \". In general, Schrenck is much too ready in this book to\naccept very improbable phenomena without adequate justification.\nThis is particularly notable in his treatment of the Eva C. medium-\nship, in which he seriously misrepresents the conclusion of the\nS.P.R. Committee (p. 21).\nStill more remarkable is the presentation of the Kraus case. Kraus\nwas a medium with whom Schrenck made telekinetic experiments in\n1924. These so impressed him that he gave a glowing account of\nthem at the Paris Congress in 1927, although in the meanwhile\nKraus had been exposed in Vienna and had confessed that he had\nalways deceived Schrenck-Notzing.\nThese and similar passages show that the present work fulfils a\npropagandist rather than a purely scientific aim. If, however, the\ninvestigations by Dr Osty and the S.P.R. of Rudi Schneider finally\ndemonstrate that paraphysical phenomena really exist, the life-\nwork of Schrenck-Notzing will have been justified, even though he\nsometimes confused the attitude of a partisan with that of a scientific\ninvestigator.\n(Translated by Th.

The book suffers from\nits very variety ; its range is wide but rarely do the letters go far\nbelow or above the surface of things. Mr Hill says, \"It is hoped\nthat this volume may serve as a sort of appendix to Sir Oliver's\nAutobiography \", and this is exactly how the volume strikes one.\nThe letters are often interesting, and they do, to quote Mr Hill\nagain, \" show aspects of his character which are not likely to appear\nin what he writes about himself ;\ngenerosity, kindliness, and other\ngood qualities of which he is perhaps unconscious \". His friends\nknow these things about him and enjoy their display in intimate\nletters, but I am not sure if the public will see his character emerge\nmore plainly than in his published works.\nThere is a most interesting account on p. 47 of his connection\nwith the invention of wireless telegraphy, which it is well to have\nrecorded in his own words, for there has been a great deal of mis-\nconception on the matter. Although the invention was the product\nof many minds, and notably, as Sir Oliver says, of Herz, yet Sir\nOliver's own large share has never received sufficient recognition,\nat any rate from the outside world.\nThere are many comments, too, on psychical affairs which demon-\nstrate the care with which he experimented and investigated, and\non p. 120 ff. the general question of telepathy and its implications is\ndealt with in a masterly way.\nLike everything which Sir Oliver writes and says, his nobility of\npurpose, his essential humility, his constant pre-occupation with\nscientific statement, and his fearless pronouncements when he is\nconvinced, shine through the pages of this book. He is, it seems,\nacutely aware that his psychical opinions have injured his standing\nas a scientist, but to be convinced of a truth means to a man of Sir\nOliver's temper to proclaim it and take the consequences. The\nconsequences in his case may well mean an even greater post-\nhumous reputation as a man of science than his living fame, great\nthough that be. E. Lyttelton.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nNational Laboratory of Psychical Research, Bulletin V.\nMr Price has followed up his Bulletin IV, in which he charged\nRudi Schneider with fraud, with Bulletin V, which chiefly refers to\nsome sittings with Rudi Schneider held in Vienna in 1924. If\nreaders of Mr Price's Bulletin IV should happen to turn to this addi-\ntional Bulletin in the hope that it may throw some light on the\nobscurer portions of his former production, they are likely to be dis-\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1933\nappointed. Rather is it likely to create a feeling of wonder in the\nminds of readers that Mr Price should have thought it worth while\nto have printed it at all. Except that it concerns the same medium\nand another charge of fraud, even vaguer and less well substantiated\nthan that made in his Bulletin IV, with which I have already dealt\nin Proceedings, it cannot be said to be of any relevant interest.\nIt seems that Mr Price is seeking to justify the charges brought\nby him against this medium in Bulletin IV by raking up some very\ndoubtful evidence of fraud, said to have been obtained nine years\nago under dissimilar conditions and in regard to a different type of\nphenomena. If Mr Price attaches such importance to the suspicions\nof Professor Meyer and Przibram why did he not include their\ntestimony in his book Rudi Schneider published in 1930 ?\nThe only specific charge made against Rudi in connection with the\nVienna sittings of 1924 is that of Professor Przibram when he says,\nin a letter written to Mr Price, and dated 28 April 1933, that while\nProfessor Meyer was controlling, he found that the medium had\nfreed his right hand for a short time. Unlike the procedure at all\nthe sittings held in London with this medium, the controller was\nattempting to control with one hand both the medium's hands and\nthose of the second controller, who, we are also told, the Professors\nconsidered to be unreliable. \" In this situation \", writes Professor\nPrzibram, \" he [Professor Meyer] noticed by feel that the medium\nhad got the right hand free ; after reinsertion, the hand was notice-\nably cooler \".\nWhat exact theories the two professors were able to formulate\nafter this experience we are not told, nor is it stated whether any\n\" phenomenon \" was recorded as having happened while the hand\nwas free. One hopes, too, that Professor Przibram, in his letter of\n28 April 1933, is quoting from contemporary notes and not from\nmemory. If this constitutes the best support Mr Price can find for\nhis newly acquired theory that Rudi can free a hand at will, when\nheld in the manner obtaining at the 1932 sittings, then Mr Price is\nbetraying the weakness of his own position.\nThe first part of the Bulletin consists of a foreword by Mr Price,\nincluding two recent letters from Professor Przibram, referring to\nthe Vienna sittings of 1924, and some comments by Mr Price,\nreferring chiefly to the sittings held by him with Rudi at his Labora-\ntory in 1932 and some subsequent correspondence with that medium ;\nthe second part is devoted to a translation of some articles which\nappeared in Vienna newspapers of 1924, giving, at second-hand, the\nimpressions of Professors Meyer and Przibram gained at four sittings\nwith Rudi, and an account of a pseudo-sitting at which Professor\nPrzibram deputised as the medium and succeeded in impressing\nfourteen high-school teachers, barristers, medical men, etc. We are\n\fJuly 1933 Notes on Periodicals 119\nnot told how many of these distinguished gentlemen had previously\nattended the real sittings with Rudi. The articles end by making\nno definite accusation of fraud, but maintain that satisfactory\nnormal explanations of the phenomena had been furnished by the\ntwo professors, a conclusion for which there seems to have been\nlittle or no evidence.\nIn his comments in the first part of this Bulletin, Mr Price tries\nfurther to strengthen his case against Rudi by statements of equally\ndoubtful relevance. In referring to Rudi's \" trance \" breathing\nand the possibility of its being duplicated by someone in a normal\nstate, Mr Price says the medium's fast breathing rarely lasts longer\nthan for one minute without its being interrupted by him speaking,\nand in support of this theory includes a portion of the notes taken\nat one sitting. In the example given, the medium spoke much oftener\nthan he usually does, and even so, two periods of four minutes or\nmore of breathing uninterrupted by speech are included.\nMr Price also reminds us that he already recorded some years ago\nhow he \" ... simulated Rudi's breathing continuously for 6J\nminutes \". I am not surprised to hear that Mr Price then felt\n\" exhausted \"\u2014indeed I am very surprised to hear he was able to\ncontinue for so long a period without a break. Mr Price, who is so\naccurate in giving us the length of his experiment to the nearest\nquarter minute, does not tell us his own rate of breathing, so we are\nunable to judge how it compared with the original in that important\ndetail.\nOn p. 19 Mr Price states that Rudi wrote to him on 7 March 1933,\naccepting an invitation to return to him in the coming autumn\n\" after he had seen Bulletin IV \", thereby implying that Rudi\nrecognised his own guilt. Mr Price should quote his authority when\nmaking statements of that kind. Actually Rudi, to whom Mr Price\nhad not sent a copy of his Bulletin IV, was not informed of its\ncontents until 9 March, when he was in Paris. On 8 March, Mr Price,\nwriting to Dr Gerda Walther, said, \" I heard from Rudi this\nmorning and he did not mention the report, although Osty must\nhave had his copy by then. I expect they are keeping it from him.\n'\n'\n1\nI have quoted this to show the value of Mr Price's statements. In\nanother statement, previously made by him in the public press, Mr\nPrice says on p. 11, when referring to the conditions under which\nRudi had agreed to sit at his Laboratory in 1932, \" Unfortunately\nwe were compelled to have this person, as Rudi would neither visit\nthe National Laboratory nor hold a seance without her.\" If by this\nMr Price means merely that Rudi had asked that his fiancee should\nI\nI regret that Mr Price's methods make it necessary to quote a personal letter\nin this way. Actually Mr Price's report was shown to Rudi by Mr Besterman and\nDr Osty the day after its receipt in Paris.\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1933\nbe invited to London, he is deliberately trying to mislead us, but if\nhe means Rudi made her presence at the sittings a condition of his\nvisit, then Mr Price should quote his authority by publishing the\nletter in which this condition was laid down. Until he does so, I shall\nrefuse to believe a statement so contrary to my own experience.\nMr Price includes a questionnaire to Dr Osty entitled \" Vital\nquestions concerning Dr Osty's Report \", and in that and some\nsubsequent remarks he attempts to belittle that Report. It may be\ndoubted whether Mr Price is really much concerned that \" Dr Osty\nmust expect his report to be mercilessly criticised \" and a suspicion\nwill no doubt cross the mind of the reader of this Bulletin V that\nMr Price feels more than a little put out that Dr Osty's more con-\nvincing methods have succeeded in arousing that scientific interest\nin the case of Rudi Schneider which his own reports so signally\nfailed to achieve.

For over 30 years he pub-\nlished (first in Hungarian, later in German and English) papers on\nthe phenomena of mental energy expressing itself in physical forms,\nthe expression of instinctual longings in alterations of physiological\nstates. The factors which lead to the employment of unusual\nphysical means of expression were on the whole of less interest to\nhim than the mechanisms of such \" conversions from psychical\nto somatic \" spheres, so he stood midway between the group of\nworkers whose main interest is the effect of anxiety and guilt in\nmental life (the present-day tendency in psycho-analysis) and those\nwhose work lies more especially in the descriptive field of psychical\nresearch.\nHis most important contributions bearing on psychical research\nlay in his stimulating papers on \" The Development of the Sense of\nReality \", in which he showed how the child's developing perception\nof the external world is a slow relinquishing of phantasies and again\nhow these phantasies are based on the child's notion of himself. In\nline with these researches are his penetrating observations on the\nway in which the mind, to conceal from itself its own defenceless-\nness in the presence of what is felt to be overwhelming and disrup-\ntive internal excitement, either attributes to the external world\nwhat really belongs within itself or attributes to itself what is\nreally external. His two most distinguished pupils have carried\nhis main contributions into fields which every psychologist has\nsooner or later to master ; Dr Geza Roheim now works on the magical\nbeliefs of aborigines, Mrs Melanie Klein on similar beliefs in civilized\nchildren.\nAfter Prof. Freud himself no one has contributed more to the\npsycho-analytical instruments of thought used in the critical\nanalysis of psychical research ; he stood second to none in his\nenthusiasm for new ideas. To the neurologist the notion of tele-\npathy must be accounted a new idea ; he hailed the notion as an\nimportant one to study. Although he did not publish observations\nof a kind usually classed as supranormal, it is well known that he\nhad been collecting data for years, but he had not sufficient evidence\nto warrant a paper. If anyone scouted the notion of telepathy being\nother than coincidence, jamais raconte or other obvious explanation,\nhe reprimanded the unscientific attitude shown and warned the\nscoffer of the almost unceasing error that scientific people fall into\nwhen they dogmatise, and pointed out that even wish-fulfillments\nserving a personal neurotic advantage might be objectively true.\n\fOctober 1933 Obituary 125\nWhen asked for the evidence of the supranormal phenomena that\nhe was so ready to welcome, he regretted that even a welcome did\nnot always bring the guest.\nSuch is the scientist we have all lost ; a smaller number mourn\nthe passing of a personal friend. His endowments in science sprang\nfrom his gift for friendship, his capacity to accept and thoroughly\nenjoy whatever was before him without being easily fooled. By his\ninsight he saw what was genial, productive and solid in everyone\nhe met, as he saw what was useful in a scientific theory of an old\nwives' tale. His life was a rare unity of mind and heart working\ntogether. Eager and romantic in temperament he maintained his\nyouthfulness even through the years of suffering, and his kindliness\neven when bitterly opposed and misunderstood.\nJohn Rickman.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nOn the Possibility of Proving Survival\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I have to thank Mr Saltmarsh for his comments in the June\nnumber of the Journal on my suggestions presented in the March\nnumber relative to the \" Possibility of Proof of Survival \" question.\nIt will be remembered we are indebted to him for raising the question\nin his article contained in Proceedings, vol. xl. But since I think the\nquestion is among the most important we have to discuss in this\nfield and since I represent a different viewpoint from that held by Mr\nSaltmarsh, I wish to consider further Mr Saltmarsh's comments.\nThe first point is a very general one. Mr Saltmarsh urges that\n\" conviction of the truth or otherwise of the survival hypothesis\nmust always be a matter of individual idiosyncrasy \" . It seems to me\nthat this condemns this problem (if not the whole field of psychical\nresearch) everlastingly as a matter of unscientific beliefs. If, on\nthe other hand, Mr Saltmarsh means only that there is at present a\nlarge element of \" individual idiosyncrasy \" involved in conviction on\nthe question, we can fully agree. This is, however, so very different\nthat we cannot infer it reliably from his own words. We could, of\ncourse, agree that the element of personal attitude on the survival\nquestion is far greater than in many questions arising in scientific\nstudy. I take this to mean, however, that the facts and techniques\nand principles are as yet quite inadequate for impersonal judgment.\nBut need we then predict that conviction \" must always \" be a\nmatter of individual idiosyncrasy, or even that it must ever remain\nto such a partial extent as it is today ? May we not say rather that,\nin as far as the study of psychical research becomes scientifically\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1033\ndeveloped the role of mere individual idiosyncrasy will be reduced ?\nThis change has occurred in other fields of inquiry and probably\nin every branch of science.\nMr Saltmarsh mentions two variables that, he believes, make\nindividual idiosyncrasy the determining factor in belief. The first\nis the \" antecedent acceptability of survival \". Surely he does not\nallow this to be a determining variable in any truly scientific inquiry !\nScience knows no \" impossibilities \", and lack of \" antecedent\nacceptability \" is no serious condition to a genuinely scientific\ndecision. The fact that most people are not truly scientific does not,\nat this point, concern us. In those who approach nearest to the\nattitude and method of science we find least of this variable.\nThe second variable Mr Saltmarsh mentions is the \" estimate of\nthe probability of the survival hypothesis in any particular case\nagainst that of the alternatives\". Now if this must always be a\nmatter of individual idiosyncrasy as he would maintain, I think\nmost critical and scientific psychical research students would give up\nat once, if convinced of this. It is to reduce the variability and\nunreliability of the personal judgment that, in any science, we try\nto establish criteria, techniques and safeguards. What a pity indeed,\nif this must be forever impossible in the field we are studying !\nRather, I doubt if any problem can be said to be \" always a matter\nof personal idiosyncrasy\n'\n'\n.\nThe second point is merely a psychological distinction. But\nit is very vital both in theoretical psychology and in this practical\nquestion of identification of agencies. The point is that Mr Saltmarsh\nattempts in the first paragraph of his letter to you, to include my\npoint of emphasis on the special identificative value of \" peculiar\npurposes \" and \" motivation \" under his expression \" habitual\nforms of thought and association of ideas \" . It is more than mere\nquibbling to discriminate here, as Dr McDougall and all the purpo-\nsive psychologists would emphatically maintain. The \" habitual\nforms \" and \" associations \" of a deceased individual are old\nestablished relations at the time of the trance experiment (i.e., if\nthey exist at all). It seems to be theoretically possible to explain\nrecall of them by the clairvoyant-telepathic-latent Memory-hypo-\nthesis ! But the intrusion of a new purpose, never before produced,\nis considerably different. It points to some purposive factor still at\nwork in a new and conative way, but which is more identifiable as\nthe purported deceased agent than as any other, living or dead. In\nthe personal recognition itself, the \" habitual forms \" and \" associa-\ntion of ideas \" play a large part, but they do not constitute the\ndynamic factor which indicates the peculiar agency, and helps to\nexclude other possible agencies. They are rather the more static\ncomponents of the mental system. In making my point, I referred\n\fOctober 1933 Correspondence 127\nto the much greater identification value of the actual functional\npeculiarity in novel situations. It is a most fundamental distinc-\ntion, and whole psychological systems have been founded on this\nvery discrimination. I think its practical value to our problem is\nvery considerable.\nA third and last point is still more important, and deals with\nthe specific illustration I used and which Mr Saltmarsh discussed.\nThe case referred to is that in which a deceased husband seems to\nintrude into an unrelated sitting a message for his wife who has an\nimpending illness of which no one living is cognizant, telling her to\nconsult a physician. The message is forced in upon a trance experi-\nment conducted for another person, to whom the sensitive is at the\ntime supposedly devoted. The most important point, that of the\nintrusion of the \" spirit \" agent concerned into the records intended\nby the sensitive and her controls for another, was not commented\non by Mr Saltmarsh other than to say, \" This, undoubtedly, presents\ndifficulty, but I think might be overcome by a little ingenuity \" . I\nraise a question here of justice to the point before us : Surely we\nmust agree that in discussing the interpretation of cases, the case\nas a whole must be considered. One part may be explainable by\nhypothesis A, another by hypothesis B, and so on. This is the\npiecemeal way in which Mr Saltmarsh deals with my case. But in\naddition to this failing to supply an alternative hypothesis for the\nmost important part of the case, the intrusion feature, he does not\neven consider the case-as-a-whole. I regard the logical seriousness\nof this failure as very great indeed.\nFinally, Mr Saltmarsh states that in this matter, \" Apodeictic\nproof is quite impossible; conviction or plausibility is subjective \".\nI agree. In quite the same way (though not the same degree) the\nremark applies to the question of Lamarckian inheritance, the\nplanetesimal hypothesis, localization of function in cortical areas\nof the brain, or the corpuscular theory of light. But the fact that\nconviction is, and must be, subjective does not mean that psychical\nresearch must forever be a matter of individual prejudice and\nidiosyncrasy. Biologists will determine the value of the Lamarckian\nhypothesis, not by \" individual idiosyncrasy \" but by improved\nmethods and experiments, and accumulated results of varied\ncharacter and condition. And psychic research students will\ndetermine the value of the survival hypothesis by the same general\nmeans. If Mr Saltmarsh were to persuade me of his essential\nrightness, I shall despair for science, not only in the field we are\ndiscussing, but in every field in which such subjective factors as\n\"antecedent acceptability\", \"plausibility\", \"individual idiosyn-\ncrasy \", and the like are possibly present in any degree. And in what\nfield are they not ?\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1933\nI believe that most critical students of psychical research will\nagree with me that the subject has its full opportunity to become\nscientific, and that final judgment on all its hypothesis, free from\nantecedent prejudice and idiosyncrasy, is an ultimate possibility and\nan objective. How long this may require and how difficult it may be,\nare aside from the point. How large a factor of personal prejudice\nwe have to deal with is also not our point. There is no reason why\nwe cannot progress here as in other fields\u2014and ultimately reach the\nrelative clarity and security obtained in other scientific advances.\nThus alone can we progress beyond the blind faith and \" individual\nidiosyncrasy \u00bb of our fathers. Yours, etc., j B Rhine.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014Mr Saltmarsh suggests, in his interesting letter to the\nJournal (xxviii. 86ff.), that in the case of mediumistic communica-\ntions, a character is built up in the mind of the medium or the sitter\nwhich behaves in a manner analogous to that in which the characters\nof a novelist or biographer behave. In support of this theory, Mr\nSaltmarsh suggests that \"it is very unusual for an ostensible\ncommunicator to get a clear, coherent message through the medium\nat his first appearance \". This has not been my experience, nor, so\nfar as I know, is it that of some of my friends who take sittings :\nthe complaint is, rather, that first sittings are often good, and are\nnot followed up by sittings equally good. My personal experience is\nas follows : At my first sitting with Mrs Leonard, my Communicator,\n\"Dora*', gave evidence not only of personal identity, but of the\nability to give test material that is, I think, in no way inferior to\nthat of the material she has given at later sittings, though there is\nrather less in the way of quantity. My first sitting with Mrs Brittain\n(which was my first with any professional medium), and my first\nsitting with Miss V. Ortner (Mrs Warren Elliott) were, also, I think,\nwell up to the average that one gets with these mediums. These\ncommunications contain material that is quite definite and veridical,\nand the sittings were both striking in certain respects.\nI understand from Mr Besterman that this is one of the points he\nis examining in his study of the Leonard records, and that he is\nprovisionally of the same opinion as myself in regard to it.\nYours, etc.,\nW_ g_ iRVING.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014When I read Mr Saltmarsh's able letter in the June issue\nof our journal it occurred to me that it might be worth while to\nreport three experiences I have had which bear on the point men-\n\fOctober 1933 Correspondence 129\ntioned in that letter. He refers to the fact that the introduction of\nan \"alien\" influence into a mediumistic sitting requires to be\nexplained. On one occasion I had a sitting made by appointment\nwith Mrs Brittain, with the object of getting some evidence for a\nman (I knew only by correspondence) concerning his wife who had\ndied. The medium knew this was my object in this proxy sitting.\nAt the outset, however, she said that someone wished to speak to me.\nA name was given, and whilst I was considering to whom it might\nbelong, details were added which identified the man who claimed to\nbe communicating, and who said he wished to thank me for helping\nhis wife. I was then surprised by the additional statement that he\nhad been an unkind husband ; in forcible language he intimated\nthat he had been miserable but was now happy.\nI had become acquainted with the wife of this man some time\nafter she had become a widow, and as she rarely mentioned her\nhusband I had never asked anything about him. Our corres-\npondence was chiefly connected with psychical research and the\nevidence for survival. I shrank from telling her about this unex-\npected experience as I thought it might be a mistake and therefore\npainful, but I felt that I must not withhold it, as, if it were true, it\nmight comfort her. I discovered that it was quite true. This lady\nhad once had a sitting with Mrs Brittain but she assured me that on\nthat occasion her husband was not mentioned.\nWhose subliminal consciousness could be responsible for this\n\"alien\" influence with its intensely human quality, and wholly\nunexpected introduction ?\nMr Saltmarsh refers to a case in which a husband appeared to be\naware of the fact that his wife had a tumour, and he thinks it quite\npossible that the subconscious knowledge of the wife could account\nfor this message she received.\nIn 1920 I had a trance sitting with Miss Naomi Bacon. Before\npassing out of the trance she pointed to her breast and said :\n\" You\nwill be healed of the trouble here \". This seemed so irrelevant that\nit rather annoyed me. The preceding interview had been so im-\npressive that I regretted that it should close with a statement which\nseemed meaningless. I was not aware of having any \" trouble \" in\nthe region indicated. Six years later, however, I was hurried into\nhospital for a very serious operation at that spot, which was quite\nsuccessful.\nIf my subconscious mind can be held responsible for this know-\nledge of my condition, can it also have known that I should be\nhealed of the trouble \\ No one could normally predict that.\nThe third point in Mr Saltmarsh's letter to which I would like to\nrefer is his statement that the first manifestation at a sitting was\nusually weak and that the personality may therefore be gradually\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1933\nbuilt, so to speak, out of the memories of the sitter telepathetically\nimparted to the medium.\nI have been successful in many proxy sittings in which I had no\nmemories of the person who claimed to communicate. In one\nparticular instance, I had never seen the widow on whose behalf I\nhad the sitting and I practically knew nothing about her. The\nresult of the first sitting was, however, very impressive to her and\nher step-father, who had asked me to help her ; the second was also\nvery full of evidential matter, though she thought the first the best.\nThe third sitting was almost a failure (the medium was fatigued).\nWhen I held the third sitting I knew much more about the widow\nas I had corresponded with her at some length and yet the person-\nality manifested very indistinctly on that occasion.\nI agree with Mr Saltmarsh that, on whatever theory, one would\nexpect communications to be easier in subsequent sittings, but this\nhas not generally been my experience. My best sittings have been\nwhen the medium's mind was a tabula rasa, i.e., she or he were\nentirely ignorant of the personality purporting to control and in\nsome instances, when I also was nearly equally ignorant.\nYours, etc.,\nHelen Alex. Dallas.\nCommunications of a Personal Kind.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014In the summary appearing in the April number of the\nJournal dealing with the paper read by me on 25 January last, I\nnotice a rather unfortunate omission. Particular importance\nattaches to the fact that, in this case, corroborative testimony was\nobtained concerning the accuracy with which these scripts repro-\nduced the personalities of the alleged communicators.\nI read a statement from my brother-in-law testifying to his\nbelief in the authenticity of these scripts. The statement is as\nfollows :\n\" Marvellous ! The script is the most wonderful thing I\nhave ever read. The personality of everyone is unmistakable. I\nhave read and re-read it many times.\"\nThis case is one in which it has fortunately been proved possible\nto obtain corroborative details from an individual intimately\nconnected with the alleged communicators. The particular interest\nthat attaches to this corroboration is that Major Forbes testifies to\nthe accurate reproduction of the personalities of deceased persons.\nClearly, the reproduction of personality furnishes the most con-\nvincing of all evidence of survival. Latent telepathy or any other\ntheory of a like nature can hardly be considered to account for it.\nYours, etc.,\nE B gibbes .\n\fOctober 1933 Reviews 131\nEEVIEWS.\nWhately Carington, The Death of Materialism, 8vo, pp. 256.\nLondon : George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1933. Price 10s. net.\nMr Whately Carington sets out to slay the dragon Materialism\nand it must be admitted that, even if that obstinate creature be\nso disobliging as to remain alive, he delivers it some pretty hard\nknocks.\nThe opening chapters are devoted to an examination of the\nunderlying non-logical foundations of belief, a matter which it is\nwell to emphasise yet one to which too much importance may be\nattached. It is laid down that sentiment of all kinds must be\nrigorously excluded. As an ideal to be striven for this is justifiable,\nbut it is surely unattainable. In a matter such as this, where the\ndeepest concerns and the most powerful emotions are involved, it\nis asking too much that the cold impersonal attitude of the mathe-\nmatician should be maintained. Conclusions can only be tentative\nseeing that they are based on the estimation of evidence, much of\nwhich is of a general and highly nebulous character. These estima-\ntions are bound to be influenced by sentiment, preconceived ideas\nand the whole past history of the estimator.\nThe case for the materialist from the physical point of view is\nfairly stated and the author has little difficulty in showing it to be\nwithout foundation. He discusses the bearing of Heisenberg's\nPrinciple and rightly, as I think, pours cold water on the enthusiasm\nof those who have claimed it as a powerful ally for idealism.\nI think that Mr Carington is undoubtedly well advised to reserve\nhis heavy artillery for the biologist and psychologist ; the physicist,\nas such, is hardly interested in the question and if he be an active\nprotagonist of materialism it is when he is operating outside his\nown province. But for those whose subject is life in any form it is\na matter of the highest import.\nThe attack on the mechanistic biologist opens with a somewhat\nelaborate argument, based on mathematical probability formulas,\nby which it is sought to show that consciousness is a \" public fact\n\"\nin the sense that it is \" a common belief in which all can share \".\nAs directly experienced it is, of course, private. It is in Chapter IV\nthat the author really gets to grips with the problem, viz., whether\nall behaviour is ultimately explicable in terms of reflexes.\nWhile accepting the teaching of the mechanistic biologists as\nregards conditioned reflexes in cases of relatively simple behaviour\nsuch as that of Pavlov's dogs, he suggests that the laws they have\ndeduced therefrom break down with the increase of complexity.\nHe draws an analogy with the failure of Newtonian law to cover\ncases involving very high velocities or temperature and very great or\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1933\nvery small distances. He distinguishes these characteristics as\n\" predicates \", contrasting them with properties of objects. Roughly,\na predicate is whatever can be said about an object which has nothing\nto do with the kind of object it is. Further, public predicates are\ndistinguished from those which are matters of private judgment.\nClassical law, under which term he includes the laws deduced\nby the mechanistic biologists, fails in cases where some public\npredicate is present in a very high degree.\nFrom these considerations the following formula is evolved.\n\" Consciousness is a correlate of that public predicate known as\ncomplexity of organisation.\"\nOn this basis it is claimed that the opinion that consciousness\nmay play a part in the determination of behaviour may be held\nwithout discontinuity with the laws derived from the study of con-\nditioned reflexes.\nPart II deals with the problem from the metaphysical standpoint.\nThe consciousness-matter antithesis is discussed and the author\ncuts the Gordian knot by denying the reality of matter\u2014the \" Ding\nan sich \". Consciousness is real, matter is only a \" fiction \", \"a\nprovisional auxiliary construct \", useful, in fact indispensable for\nour ordinary commerce with life, but possessing no metaphysical\nvalidity of its own. He accepts the philosophy of Vaihinger as\npropounded in that writer's well known work, \" The philosophy of\nas if \".\nThe next part of the book opens with a useful discussion of the\nnature of proof based on evidence and this serves as an introduction\nto the subject of Paragnosis, a term which covers practically all\nsupernormal psychical phenomena. The term is selected, or perhaps\nI should say coined, for the sake of its wide generality. For this\nspecial purpose Mr Carington requires only that knowledge should be\nacquired in a supernormal manner, whether it be by telepathy,\nclairvoyance, etc., does not matter. He takes telepathy, however,\nas his example for demonstration purposes. The point at issue is\nhow one mind can act on another regardless of intervening distance.\nThe wave theory is discussed and rejected and \" action at a distance\"\nin general is examined. The conclusion arrived at is that \" location\nin itself \" shares the fate of non-existence with the \" Ding an sich \".\n*\"\nTelepathy comes about, not by the transmission of ideas, but by\ncommunity of consciousness.\"\nHere we reach the culminating point of the enquiry, from com-\nmunity of consciousness \" we must infer a Universal Consciousness\nof which individual consciousnesses are fragments, off shoots, local\ncentres ...\" and thus we are led into the very heart of mysticism.\nThe whole argument is admirably summed up by the author\nhimself in four points which he claims to have established.\n\fOctober 1933 Reviews 133\n1 . the liability of classical law to breakdown.\n2. the elimination of the Thing-in-itself.\n3. the recognition of the fundamental unity of consciousness.\n4. the insistence that the conception of an external world acting\non consciousness must be replaced by that of mutations of con-\nsciousness as the only reality.\nIf these things be so it seems that all that is left for materialism\nis to choose a fitting epitaph and get itself buried with all convenient\nrapidity.\nBut an uneasy doubt remains in my mind. I cannot help feeling\nthat even if materialism be dead, some of its offsprings, more dan-\ngerous because more insidious and plausible, may survive. Mr\nCarington is an avowed determinist and I cannot see that there is\nmuch to choose between a deterministic system from which gross\nmatter has been eliminated and one based solely on matter.\nI can hardly agree with him that the libertarian view which\naccepts some measure of freewill is \"no more than the product of\nvanity\". One need only mention the name of Henri Bergson to\nrefute this opinion. Although it cannot be said that the controversy\nis by any means settled, there is undoubtedly a strong case in favour\nof freewill as is shown, for example, in Mr Charles A. Campbell's\nScepticism and Construction.\nIt is, I take it, no part of the business of the reviewer to indulge\nin detailed criticism, but I cannot refrain from the remark that if\nthe Ding-an-sich be eliminated and mutations of consciousness be\nthe only reality, it is somewhat hard to see how consciousness can be\nthe correlate of complexity of organisation. What is it that is or-\nganised complexly ? Consciousness cannot be the correlate of itself.\nThe final conclusion is frankly mystical and as such will not be\nassimilable by a good many readers, among whom I fear that\nI must count myself. This is not a criticism. The fault lies, not with\nthe author, but with those who cannot apprehend mystical ideas.\nStill, however this may be, Mr Whately Carington has made a\nvaluable contribution towards the solution of the controversy,\nfor, granted his fundamental assumptions and from his individual\nstandpoint, he has put up a very strong case.\nThe book possesses a greater degree of lucidity than is usually\nfound in works of this character ; it is easy and pleasant to read,\nthere are copious illustrations which assist the comprehension of the\narguments and if the \" verbal caracoles \" in which he indulges so\nfreely may possibly be distasteful to some of his ultra-serious\nreaders, I, at least, appreciate a little leavening of mild flippancies\nas a welcome lightening of an otherwise rather indigestible meal.\nThey are the raisins in the duff, the jam with the powder.\nH.

Berlin, Leipzig\n:\nVerlag Walter de Gruyter and Co., 1933.\nIt is satisfactory that the long awaited records of Baron von\nSchrenck-Notzing's sittings with Rudi Schneider have at last been\npublished. Unfortunately, however, they have been published in\na most inadequate manner. Of the eighty-eight sittings held with\nRudi Schneider by the Baron, records of only thirty-four are here\npublished. And even these records are clearly printed only in\npart (cp. pp. iv-v), without indication of the portions omitted and\nwithout commentary. This seems to be neither here nor there.\nEither the entire records should have been printed as left by Baron\nvon Schrenck-Notzing or a competent person should have been\ncommissioned to compile an independent account of the sittings\nbased on the original records. In short, while the material we have\nnow been given is better than nothing, it adds little material of a\ndefinite nature to our knowledge of Rudi Schneider's mediumship.\nWe venture to hope that the Baroness von Schrenck-Notzing, in\nview of the importance this mediumship has attained since the\nBaron's death, may yet be persuaded to give adequate publication\nto her husband's records. And we venture further to extend this\nappeal to the documents relating to other mediums also left un-\npublished by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing.\nTh. B.\nFox-Taylor Automatic Writings 1869-1892. Unabridged record.\nEdited by Sarah E. L. Taylor. Preface by W. G. Longworthy\nTaylor. 4to, pp. x. 400, 6 facsimiles and ill. Privately\nprinted 1932.\nThis substantial volume reproduces in full the text of automatic\nmirror-writing done by Katie Fox (Mrs Jencken) in sittings with\nthe Taylor family from 1869 to 1892. The script does not appear\nto contain any evidential material, but it is at least free from the\npretentiously didactic matter that fills so many volumes of this\nkind : the communications nearly all purport to come from deceased\nmembers of the family. Their chief interest for the student\nnaturally lies in their production by a medium who is so important\nin the history of psychical research as Katie Fox.\nThe book is unfortunately a mere reprint of the original transcript,\nand no attempt has been made to edit and index it. It may be of\ninterest, therefore, to note that physical phenomena are constantly\nrecorded. Such phenomena as raps, fights, the pulling of garments,\ndirect writing, apports, occurred. More unusual incidents were the\n\fOctober 1933 Reviews 135\nproduction of direct drawings. No information is given as to the\nconditions in which the sittings were held, but it is clear from\nincidental remarks (as on pp. 9, 18, 21) that they took place in the\ndark. Suspicious incidents, unfortunately, are not lacking : such\nare the constant movements the sitters were instructed to make\nabout the room. Such again is the loss of Frankie's portrait shortly\nbefore a supernormal picture of him was obtained (p. 24).\nTh. B.\nLa Tombe Parle. Le Genie Hugolien ressucite. Edited by Henri\nAzam. 8vo, pp. 429. Paris : J. Peyronnet et Cie., 1932.\nThis bulky volume contains automatic writings by a Mme D.,\npurporting to come from a spirit called Symbole, who claims to\nhave been the inspirer of Victor Hugo. The content of the com-\nmunications is of little interest, but the form of those in verse does\nfrom time to time echo the rhythms of Hugo. The reflection often\noccurs to one, however, in reading automatic verse, that if such\nverse often resembles the writings of certain poets, it is perhaps\nbecause many of those writings are themselves to all intents and\npurposes automatic (cp. Aldous Huxley, Texts and Pretexts, p. 9).\nIn the present case, as we are told next to nothing of the medium,\nnot even her name, it is not possible to form an opinion.\nTh.

An independent investigation\nby Mr Besterman and myself (as yet unpublished) appears to con-\nfirm this finding.\nAnticipating a full discussion of these results, I wish to suggest\nthat a substantially crucial extension of the technique would\nconsist of testing the (ostensibly) same Control working through two\nor more different mediums. If significant resemblances were found\nbetween two such versions of the Control, it would be scarcely\npossible to regard either as a secondary personality of the medium\nconcerned, and the Control's status as an autonomous entity would\nbe established to a very high degree of probability.\nYours, etc.,\nWhately Carington.\nREVIEWS.\nE. Osty, \" Telepathie Spontanee et Transmission de Pensee experi-\nmentale \", Revue Metapsychique, July\/August 1932-January\/\nFebruary 1933.\nIn the January-February number of the Revue Metapsychique Dr\nOsty concludes an admirable survey of our present knowledge of\ntelepathy in all its varying modes and aspects of manifestation.\nThis brilliant and fascinating study by one of the leading psychical\nresearchers of our time should be read by all who desire to know\nwhat fight the best French experimentation in recent years has\nthrown upon the problem of supernormal knowledge.\nWe, in England, as Osty repeatedly points out, are perpetually\nhampered in our study of sensitives by tne spiritualistic atmosphere\nin which most of our work is carried out. With the spiritualistic\nmedium the true significance of the process of supernormal cognition\nis often obscured by his inveterate tendency to dramatise fragments\nof information received probably from a living mind in the form of\nconversations with the departed. Dr Osty has had the advantage\nof studying excellent subjects, like Mme Morel, who have never\ncome under the influence of spiritualistic ideas. When a sitter is\n1\nBulletin No. 1 of The American Psychical Institute.\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1933\ntaken to Mme Morel she will often give very accurate and detailed\ninformation about the sitter's past and present affairs and sometimes\ndetailed descriptions of the sitter's friends and relatives who are\nstill living. Give Mme Morel a handkerchief belonging to a living\nfriend and she will describe the personal appearance, habits, occu-\npation, etc., of this absent living person just as precisely as our best\nEnglish mediums will do when they claim to communicate with a\ndead person's spirit. But let Mme Morel handle an object associated\nwith someone who is dead, and she will describe that dead person\nwith exactly the same sort of detail as if he were living except that\nshe will see no future for him. But, it is important to observe, she\nwill make no claims to be in communication with the departed\nperson ; she will have no message for his relatives, nor anything to\nsay about his present state. She will simply describe him objectively\nas a person who has once lived but is now dead.\nA long and persevering study of Mme Morel and other sensitives\nleads Osty to the inevitable conclusion that whether the medium\nreceives information about a dead person or a living person, the\nunderlying supernormal processes are essentially the same. The\ndramatic conversations with the spirits, the Controls, Guides, etc.,\nare so much subconscious window-dressing which the mind of the\nmedium creates in order to satisfy her sitters, the majority of whom\nvisit her with the express purpose of talking with their dead friends.\nDr Osty devotes his first article to a brief historical resume of\npast experiments in the voluntary transmission of thought from one\nperson to another. He gives an account of the various individual\nand mass experiments that have been undertaken in America,\nEngland and France in attempts to demonstrate the direct trans-\nmission of thought, including those of Warcollier, Gardner Murphy,\nand myself, and he concludes with perfect justice that the power to\nreceive telepathically a thought which an agent tries voluntarily to\ntransfer is not possessed by the generality of mankind. Neverthe-\nless this kind of telepathic perception is possible in the case of a few\nrare persons like Mme Kahl or (we may add) Mrs Upton Sinclair,\nwho seem indubitably capable of reading thoughts which an agent\nis holding in his mind or has been thinking about a moment or two\nago. Osty describes several interesting and irreproachable experi-\nments with Mme Kahl, and his testimony, added to that of Mr\nBesterman and M. Warcollier, leaves little doubt that Mme Kahl at\nany rate really possesses such a faculty. Dr Osty, however, points\nout that apparently only those subjects can exercise the faculty who\nare capable of putting themselves into some kind of trance or slight\nself-hypnosis.\nOsty says that some spiritualistic writers have \" travestied my\nthought \" by seeing in my recent failure to transmit ideas \" under\n\fNovember 1933 Reviews 141\nthe worst possible \" conditions to 600 people, an argument in favour\nof the theory that mediums obtain their information from the\nspirits of the dead and not from the minds of the living. I agree\nwith Osty that this argument, which has been used by at least one\nwriter of repute, is entirely fallacious. All that my experiments\nshow is that the voluntary transmission of thought is rare, but it is\nthe involuntary transfer of ideas that we are concerned with in our\nstudies of mediums. Because the masses of mankind show no evi-\ndence of receiving telepathic impressions from their fellows, it does\nnot follow that when we meet with individuals like Mrs Leonard,\nwho possess undoubted supernormal powers, these rare individuals\nonly succeed by the aid of the discarnate or derive their knowledge\nfrom the minds of the dead. For the experiments of Dr Osty\ndemonstrate in the clearest possible manner that sensitives of non-\nspiritualistic culture like Mme Morel and S. Ossowiecki in the vast\nmajority of instances actually do derive their supernormal indica-\ntions from the minds of living people, either present or at a distance.\nIn the case of Ossowiecki, Osty shows that the evidence strongly\nfavours the view that when this sensitive divines the contents of a\nsealed envelope, it is not by any kind of X-ray clairvoyance of the\nconcealed material that he obtains his supernormal cognitions, but\nthat he proceeds by using the envelope as a \" rapport \" object to put\nhim into touch with the mind of the distant writer, who probably is\nnot thinking of the subject at the moment. Apart from Ossowiecki's\nsubjective sensations about the way in which his faculty works, the\nproofs that the above view is the correct one are twofold. Osso-\nwiecki often adds to his vision of the contents of the envelope a\ndetailed description of the personal appearance and environment of\nthe absent writer, and on occasion he has been known correctly to\ndivine, not the actual message inside the envelope, but another\nmessage which the writer had first intended to enclose but had after-\nwards discarded. In the second place, M. Ossowiecki persistently\nfails to read the envelopes prepared by certain individuals, but\ngenerally succeeds with other persons. It has always seemed to me\nthat this last argument is peculiarly fatal when applied to the claims\nof spiritualistic mediums that they obtain the bulk of their informa-\ntion from the spirits of the dead. If it were merely a question of a\nspirit communicating information to the subconscious mind of a\nmedium, why is it that sitter A., who is as well provided with\ndeceased friends as sitter B., is yet entirely unable to obtain any\nsatisfactory evidence of their existence, no matter what medium\nhe visits, while sitter B. can get abundant evidence ? Is not Osty's\nexplanation the true one. namely that the bulk of the supernormal\ninformation received by B. is the result of an inter-mental colla-\nboration between his mind and that of the psychic, and that B.\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1933\nsucceeds because certain strata of his mind are more permeable than is\nthe case with A. ? I conjecture that A. would fail equally with a non-\nspiritualistic sensitive like Mme Morel and B. would probably succeed.\nThe third article [November-December 1932] is the most infor-\nmative and illuminating part of Osty's notable memoir, embodying\nas it does a large number of really first-rate cases taken from Osty's\nlong and varied experience with French sensitives such as Mme\nMorel, Mile Laplace and Mile de Berly. Certain of these cases we\nwere already familiar with in the Supernormal Faculties in Man,\nbut there are here published a number of new studies which seem to\nbe no less striking and conclusive. Many of these recitals are of\ndramatic and absorbing human interest. They show, in the first\nplace, how unsafe it is for persons who have mislaid their jewels or\ntheir friends, and for detectives in the pursuit of missing husbands\nor daughters, to put their trust in the pronouncements of even the\nbest mediums. For it seems that sensitives only rarely get into\ntouch with the real unknown facts of the case, but are much more\nprone to reflect, sometimes with startling verisimilitude, the mental\nconjectures of the persons who come to consult them. Thus a lady\nwho suspected that her jewel had been stolen, was told by the\nsensitive (who had no reason to suspect even that there was a jewel\nin question) that the jewel had been stolen ; an exact description\nwas given of the trinket and of the circumstances of its disappearance,\nthe persons whom the lady suspected, etc. ; but a year or two later\nthe lady found that she had merely mislaid her jewel and that there\nhad been no robbery. But though the actual statements about the\nfate of the missing object or friend proved in the last analysis to be\ntotally false, the consultants were invariably deceived in the early\nstages of the inquiry by the ease with which the medium took up\nthe scent and by the wealth of detailed knowledge which she dis-\nplayed concerning the circumstances of the disappearance and the\npersons involved.\nThe story of the countess on whose behalf Dr Osty consulted Mme\nMorel with regard to the claims of a girl who pretended to be the\nGrand Duchess Anastasie, and who claimed to have escaped the\nmassacre of the Russian Imperial family, is of absorbing interest.\nIn this case Mme Morel described with astonishing detail not what\nactually happened at the massacre, but what the impostor wished\npeople to believe had happened. It would appear that the mere\nhandling of a dried flower which had belonged to the pretended\nGrand Duchess sufficed in order to put Mme Morel into mental\nrapport with the mind of the distant impostor, who must have been\ntotally unaware that she was ventilating her case in this unexpected\nway through a Paris medium.\nVery rare indeed are the cases studied by Osty in which it is\n\fNovember 1933 Reviews 143\nnecessary to suppose that the source of the information given was\nthe memory of a dead person. He does, however, mention one such\nexperience\u2014that which led to the finding of the dead body of an old\nman who was lost in a wood\u2014but as this case is fully described in\nhis book, Supernormal Faculties in Man, most readers will be already\nfamiliar with it. To account for such rare experiences as this, is it\nnecessary to suppose like E. Bozzano that the surviving spirit of the\ndead man himself communicated the information to the medium,\nsince, so far as we know, the facts were within the knowledge of no\nliving person ? I do not think so. Because a person ceases to five\nwe must not assume that his past mental states cease to exist or to\nbe accessible to a psychic sensitive. Psychical research is slowly\nteaching us that from the plane on which the sensitive works, the\npresent moment has less significance than either the past or the\nfuture moments of an individual life. We believe the present to be\nreal because in it we enjoy and suffer and make contact with life,\nand most men believe that their past mental states must exist some-\nwhere because they can to some extent be evoked by memory. Why\nthen does it become difficult to beheve that a man's past mental\nstates continue to exist after he is dead ? Chiefly, I think, because\nmost men have not yet freed themselves from the theory that\nmemory is merely a faint resuscitation of impressions made upon\nthe nervous matter of the brain. But the moment we abandon this\nmaterialistic hypothesis, for which there seems very little evidence,\nwe ought to have no difficulty in supposing that a man's past mental\nstates exist even when he, as a personality, has ceased to five. A\npsychic medium may have access to these unconscious mental\nstates of a hving person. Those of us who, like myself, accept pre-\nvision of the individual fife by sensitives as a fact, must go further\nand suppose that a man's future mental states are as truly existent\nat any present moment as his past mental states. From this stand-\npoint our mental life is like a dark road mapped out along its length\nwith innumerable details along which our consciousness moves like\na car with only a rear fight. But on the dark track that lies ahead\npsychic sensitives occasionally flash their spotlights, giving us frag-\nmentary ghmpses tantalising and uncertain.\nIn the last section of his paper Osty rejects the naive beliefs of\nordinary spiritualism with its anthropomorphic hereafter, but he\ndoes not rule out the possibility that the transcendental conscious-\nness in man, which is unfettered by time or space, may not exist _\nin\nan eternal present. The puny individual self of everyday life which\ncan be extinguished by drugs or alcohol, or radically changed by\ndisease, is, Osty believes, doomed to perish. Personally I agree\nwith Osty in this, and I for one have not sufficient vanity or self-love\nto wish to preserve what H. G. Wells calls \" this sharp-witted\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1933\nferret \". At the same time I recognise that if the power of forming\nmental images is not dependent on the structural integrity of the\nbrain, there seems no reason why we should not go on having mental\nrepresentations after physical death, and these images would neces-\nsarily be memory images of the objects we had seen in life. Such a\nmental existence, divorced from the stimulation of the senses, would\npartake of the nature of a pointless and passionless dream. It would,\nI imagine, be very much like an ordinary dream from which there\nwas no awakening to reality. You can only give reality to the\nordinary spiritualist's conception of the future life by making all\nsorts of hypothetical assumptions about the existence of an \" etheric\n\"\nbody, and until the spiritualists can produce some serious evidence\nof the existence of such an entity I am afraid the after-death de-\nscriptions of their seers will leave Dr Osty unconvinced.\nI am not quite sure how far future research will justify Osty's\nmain contention that the production of supernormal knowledge is\nthe result of an inter-mental collaboration of an intelligent kind\nbetween two human beings on some supernormal plane of thought.\nThat the great majority of cases can be explained on this assumption\nis certainly true. It seems to be true in the case of Ossowiecki, but\nwhat about the recent book-tests of Th. Besterman obtained by Mrs\nLeonard and Judge Dahl's daughter ?\nI am generally sceptical about book-tests, but these recent experi-\nments, I must admit, have shaken my scepticism. The results go\nfar beyond what chance coincidence could be expected to produce,\nand I think it extremely improbable that Besterman was tricked in\nany way. What is the source of the medium's information in such\ncases ? Is it the mind of someone who has read the book ? If so,\nhow can the book serve as a rapport \" object to put the psychic\ninto touch with this mind ? I can understand a personal article,\nsuch as a glove or a jewel, serving as a link, but a book, new from the\nprinting-press, and which may not have been read by anyone who\nhas handled it, is another matter. And yet, when we consider the\nproblem, is the role played by the book really more complex than\nthe role of the empty chair which in Osty's famous experiment\nserved to link up Pascal Forthuny with the distant person who was\nhalf an hour later to occupy that same chair ? In the latter case the\nsource of the information was undoubtedly the mind of the future\noccupant of the chair, and if this is so it seems quite possible that\nthe book does serve in some mysterious way as a rapport object\nlinking the medium to the memory of some reader.\nI could continue writing about Dr Osty's stimulating and thought-\nprovoking memoir, but I trust I have said sufficient to induce my\nfellow-members to read for themselves the rich records of observa-\ntion and experiment which it contains. S. G. Soal.\n\fNovember 1933 Reviews 145\nSir Oliver Lodge, My Philosophy. 8vo, pp. 318. London\n:\nErnest Benn, Ltd., 1933. Price 21s. net.\nThis book, which the author describes as \" probably my final\npronouncement ... as to what I think of things in general \", will\nappeal chiefly to those who like a good strong substantial peg on\nwhich to hang their thinking.\nSir Oliver is, of course, well known as the staunchest and most\neminent\u2014as he is likely to be the last\u2014upholder of the doctrine of\nan objective Ether of Space. This, he tells us, has been his life\nstudy, and some two-thirds of the book are devoted to a defence of\nthe doctrine. He is equally well known as a convinced survivalist,\nand he believes that in the Ether is to be found the common factor,\nas it were, of the material and spiritual worlds. His view is that the\nmaterial body which serves \" the psychical or mental need ... is\nmade of matter and used by soul. So also the pneumatical body is\none used by spirit and made of X. My hypothesis is that partially\nand approximately X = Ether. This view . . . does not . . . claim\nany direct association of mind with matter : it claims association\nwith an intermediate substance. My hypothesis is that spirit\nprimarily inhabits the ether, uses it, and acts on it. . . . Thus\nthrough the intervention of ether, spirit can be brought into relation\nwith matter, indirectly : and the intervening mechanism ... is the\netheric or spiritual body \"\n(pp. 221-2).\nThis sounds very lucid and encouraging. Spirit, Ether, Matter ;\nX : Y : : Y : Z ;\nSpirit is to Ether as Ether is to Matter, or some-\nthing very like this. The trouble begins when we ask what Spirit,\nEther and Matter are\u2014and answer comes there none.\nIt distresses me that I, whose knowledge of physics is relatively\nnegligible, should be compelled by a harsh editorial decree to cross\nswords with Sir Oliver Lodge on a point like this ; but honesty\ncompels me to say frankly that I do not believe in a substantial\nEther and, a fortiori, do not believe that the view quoted above is\nthe proper way of representing the relation between what we call\nmind or spirit and what we call matter. Such a remark would be a\nmere impertinence if it were left unexpanded and unjustified, but it\nfortunately seems possible to indicate where the trouble has arisen\nand to suggest an alternative view not wholly incompatible with Sir\nOliver's own.\nThe key to the deadlock seems to lie in a passage (pp. 122 et seqq.)\nin which Sir Oliver takes Sir James Jeans to task for supporting the\nview that \" the only proper objects of study (are) the sensations that\nthe objects of the external universe produce on our senses \". I\nshould not put it quite like this myself, partly because there are\nother constituents of our mental content besides sensations which are\nhighly important, e.g., memories, and partly because it begs the\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1933\nquestion by assuming that there really are \" objects of the external\nworld \", which is the whole point at issue. This Sir Oliver clearly\nsees, for he instantly asks how, in this case, \" can we gain a know-\nledge of the external world ?\n\" The strict answer is that we don't.\nThe external world is created by us to account for the sensations,\netc., and to enable us to deal with them in an orderly manner. I\nknow that this is a difficult conception to grasp, but it seems to be\ninescapable, and I am sure that Sir Oliver would readily admit that,\nstrictly, neither he nor anyone else has ever experienced or can\nexperience anything directly except variations in his own conscious\ncontent, and that, consequently, everything else is to some extent\nderivative. Speaking for myself, I feel that Ether must be a\nremoter derivative than matter\u2014a kind of second order fiction, so\nto speak\u2014but I should be sorry to have to justify this ; so perhaps\nwe can meet on the ground that Ether is no less and no more \" real\n\"\nthan Matter. The hope seems rather slender, however, for the only\nmeaning reasonably attachable to the word \" real \" seems to be\n\" conforming to definition \". We may compare Bosanquet's\ndictum here that \" Everything is real provided you do not take it\nfor more than it is \", and may illustrate by observing that a real pond\nis the kind of thing you can get wet in, while a real mirage is not.\nA \" real \" Ether, then, is merely one which conforms to definition\n\u2014\nof Ether. It certainly does not conform to any accepted definition\nof substance, and if we are to call it substantial we must find another\nterm for the class which includes cheese and ivory and platinum.\nI see no reason myself why you should not postulate an entity\nhaving any properties you please, provided they are not logically\nincompatible, and those about which we usually complain where the\nEther is concerned, such as enormous density combined with im-\nperceptibility, or the like, are not so ;\nthey are merely contrary to\nexperience. So far as this is concerned, the Ether seems to be very\nmuch on a par with non-Euclidean Space or non-commutative\nalgebra, and it is a handy enough fictional tool to work with up to a\npoint. But the mere fact that most physicists nowadays have\ndiscarded it in favour of less concrete conceptions does seem to\nsuggest that it has its limitations.\nMy own, alternative, view may be very briefly indicated as follows\n:\nSir Arthur Eddington, discussing what he calls Relation Structure\n{The Nature of the Physical World, Chapter XI), describes how the\nfundamental entities of field physics may be derived from raw\nmaterial no more specialised than \" relata \", \" relations \" and\n\" some kind of relation of likeness between some of the relations \",\nthe last being necessary because \" otherwise there would be nothing\nmore to be said about the world than that everything in it was\nutterly unlike everything else \".\n\fNovember 1933 Reviews 147\nI think it undeniable that no more general starting point could\nbe conceived ; for whether we are dealing with Energy, Momentum\nand Stress or with the Persons of the Trinity, we must have relata of\nsome kind and relations of a sort between them. I think it follows\nthat, if anything at all is derivable from such material\u2014as it is,\nsince the entities of physics are\u2014then everything whatsoever must\nbe, in principle at least. That is to say, it is not inherent in the\nnature of things, but the result of our lack of skill, that we cannot\nderive from the same so general material the fundamental entities of\nworlds other than physical, if these exist. In this connection it is\nsuggestive that in the physical application of the technique only one\nof various possible methods of manipulation is adopted and, even so,\na good deal of what Eddington calls \" lumber \" has to be discarded\nas irrelevant\u2014to the physical world.\nIt seems to me helpful to think that the physical world consists\nof those \" modulations of consciousness \" which are linked together\n(related) in a particular way, namely that described by the laws of\nphysics, while the spiritual world consists of those which are linked\nin another way, equally specifiable in principle although as yet\nundetermined, but forming part of the same network.\nI am inclined to think that thought along these lines is likely to\nlead to more permanent results than Athanasian attempts to devise\nsome ambivalent intermediary between two mutually exclusive\ncategories.\nBut this is aiming very high, and it is probable that most people\nwill feel that the comparative imaginableness of Sir Oliver's\nview more than compensates for any logical peccadilloes it may\ninvolve.\nWhately Carington.\nHerbert Thurston, S.J., The Church and Spiritualism. 8vo,\npp. xxi. 384. Milwaukee : The Bruce Publishing Co., 1933.\nPrice \u00a72.75.\nFather Thurston's writings on psychical research and spiritualism\nhave been notable, as coming from a Roman Catholic and a Jesuit,\nfor their broad tolerance and their wide familiarity with the facts.\nIn this volume he has reprinted a series of his most valuable papers,\nchiefly from The Month. Father Thurston maintains (p. xi), first,\n\" that genuine and inexplicable phenomena, even of the physical\norder, do occur in the presence of certain exceptionally constituted\npersons called '\nmediums '\n;\nsecondly, that for the most of mankind,\nand notably for Catholics, spiritualistic practices, quite apart from\nthe Church's prohibition, are dangerous and altogether undesirable ;\nand thirdly, that people have learned nothing from their attempted\nintercourse with the spirits of the departed . . .\n.\" It may be\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1933\ndoubted whether anybody outside the Roman Catholic Church will\nfully accept all three of these propositions ; but any book from a\nwriter of Father Thurston's erudition deserves to be read with the\nclosest attention.\nTh.

The authors tell the story by use of the\ncorrespondence which has survived, with narrative to link up and\nexplain the letters, and preliminary sketches of the lives and beliefs\nof Houdini and Doyle. The strain of Houdini's attacks on the\nmediums and phenomena in which Doyle believed so strongly\nfinally brought the friendship to an end.\nHoudini was a magician especially noted for his escapes from\nlocked rooms and from all types of bonds. These he held to be due\nto skill and physical strength alone, but Conan Doyle was convinced\nthat they were done by the aid of supernatural powers. The sitting\ngiven by Lady Doyle to Houdini, and his subsequent attempts at\nautomatic writing are fully described. It was the difference in their\nversions and interpretations of this sitting which brought about a\ncoolness between Doyle and Houdini, and ultimately led to the end\nof their friendship.\nThe second book, written by a prominent American magician,\nis intended to warn the general public against dealings with so-\ncalled fortune-tellers, clairvoyants, astrologers, and mediums.\nMany stories are told of men and women who were ruined or driven\nto suicide, after having paid large sums of money for the consolation\nand communications received, or having entrusted their savings to\n\" mediums \" who were to invest it according to the advice of the\n\" spirits \". Needless to say, they found that the money and the\nmediums vanished together. In each case the mechanism of the\ncommunications and answers to questions is revealed, the explana-\ntions being made clear by the use of diagrams, drawn by James and\nHoward Savage. Most of the methods described must already be\nfamiliar to readers of the Journal ;\nsimple substitutions of blanks for\npapers on which questions are written, the use of \" roller-slates \",\nfake writing-boards, fire-eating and handling tricks, invisible inks,\nspirit-photography and other similar devices.\n\fNovember 1933 Reviews 149\nThe author writes to expose fraudulent and imitation mediums.\nHe is not concerned with those genuine ones who do not give advice\non investments or profess to be able to read the whole future, and he\nbelieves that \" there have been inexplicable phenomena \" at\nsittings with real spiritualists.\nK.

The\nsittings were held in the dark, in which Mr Duncan took very full\nnotes. Mr Duncan, his wife, and their friends who attended these\nsittings, appear to have found them extremely satisfactory, both as\nto voice and content. They all received perfect messages on every\noccasion from many relatives and friends. Trumpets moved, ecto-\nplasm appeared, perfume filled the air.

Mead.\nFor some years past Mr Mead had been a familiar figure at meetings\nof the S.P.R. He often took part in the discussions, especially\nwhen present problems could be illuminated by reference to the\npast.\nHe will best be remembered by the Quest, a quarterly review of\ncomparative religion, philosophy and mysticism, which he founded\nand edited during its twenty-one years of existence. Having been\nfor many years closely associated with Madame Blavatsky and Mrs\nBesant in their theosophical work, he was well acquainted with the\nphenomena with which our Society deals.\nIt is no secret that since the death of his wife in 1921, Mr Mead\nhad had a long series of sittings with more than one private medium.\nNo record has been kept of these sittings, indeed he has stated that\nconversation was so varied that note-taking was impossible at the\ntime, and he did not trust his memory for a subsequent record. But\nin his opinion he had obtained ample evidence, not only of survival\nof contemporaries, but of the possibility, under certain conditions,\nof entering into communication with philosophers and divines of\nother ages and distant countries. The thesis of a \" Group Soul\n\"\nset out in The Road to Immortality seemed to him to throw much\nlight on these experiences.\nL. J. J.\nMrs C. B. Fernald.\nWe regret to record the death on 10 November of Mrs Fernald,\nafter a long and painful illness. Until eighteen months ago, when\nshe became too ill to attend, she was seldom absent from the meet-\nings of the Society.\nMrs Fernald was elected a Member in 1920 and at once became\nkeenly and actively interested in the work of the Society, contri-\nbuting valuable evidence from time to time, and participating in\nvarious experiments. In particular, she was one of the most impor-\ntant sitters in the Warren-Elliott investigation, and she also placed\nat the Society's disposal all the evidence obtained at her Leonard\nsittings. In her keenness to help the Society she did much useful\nwork in the Library for Mr Besterman during the last year or two\nbefore her illness began.\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1933\nMrs Fernald suffered greatly but her fortitude and gay courage,\nand her interest in others never failed. She will be remembered by\nher many friends as \" a very gallant gentlewoman \". t vr\nCASE.\nA Telepathic Impression.\nL. 1299.\nThe following case of a telepathic impression, received by two\npersons in the same room, was reported to Sir Oliver Lodge by Mr\nPaul B. Statham, 444 Bulwer Street, Maritzburg, South Africa, who\nwas himself one of the percipients. The other percipient was Henry\nSchietekat, a boy of thirteen who was staying with Mr Statham\nfor the week-end and sharing his room. It appears from the\ncorrespondence that Henry often spent his week-ends with Mr\nStatham so that they could boat together on the river.\nMr Statham's account of the incident is as follows :\n\" 14 August, 1933.\n\"... Last Saturday night he [Henry] and I had been in bed for\nsome time. I was reading awhile but he had apparently gone fast\nasleep. After I had switched out the light and was composing\nmyself for slumber, an inexplicable feeling came over me, a feeling\nthat somebody wanted Henry. I tried to throw it off, but it persisted.\n\" After a few minutes of this, judge my astonishment when\nHenry suddenly turned over in bed and sat up wide awake.\n'\nBunny,' he said to me, '\nI don't know how it is but I feel certain\nthat Mother wants me. I wonder if anything has gone wrong.'\n\" I replied that I had had much the same impression and suggested\nthat he should go home [a distance of nearly two miles] and see.\nIt was a cold night, but that didn't deter Henry (who adores his\nmother). Out of the warm bed he sprang, dressed hurriedly . . .\nand went off post-haste on his push-bike, 11 p.m. He didn't\nreturn that night, so in the morning I rode up to his parents' place\nto investigate. I found that there was nothing wrong with his\nmother, but that her favourite uncle, living close by, had been\ntaken seriously ill. She was alone in the house (save for two small\ngirls, Henry's sisters) and had nobody to send out for the doctor.\nHenry turned up unexpectedly in the nick of time, consequent on\nhis mental impression, and was able to summon medical help.\n\" Now I can understand perhaps Henry's receiving the telepathic\nmessage from his well-loved mother, but it was remarkable that\nI also should have got the impression,\u2014being no relation. His\nmother was aware that he was sleeping at my place. . . .\n\" [Signed] Paul B. Statham.\"\n\fDecember 1933 Case 157\nLater we received a statement from Henry who, after explaining\nabout the boating parties, and that he is not at all \" spooky \", gives\nthe following account\n:\n\" 31 Oct. 1933.\n\" On the twelfth of August we had both gone to sleep, when I felt\nin some way which [I] can't explain that Mummy wanted me for\nsomething badly. I sat up and told Bunny [Mr Statham], and he\nsaid he thought the same. So I got up, dressed, and went home\non my push-bike. When I got home I found that Mummy really\ndid want me because her uncle had been taken very ill, she was all by\nherself in the house, and she wanted to send me for the doctor.\nThe next day was Sunday, at 12 o'clock Mummy's uncle died.\n\" [Signed] Henry Schietekat.\"\nMrs Schietekat wrote :\n\" 24 Pietermaritzburg Street,\nMaritzburg, South Africa,\n31 Oct. 1933.\n\" It was on the 12th of August when my uncle took ill suddenly\nand I was wishing that Henry was home all the time, so as we could\nsend him for the doctor. Strange to say, a little afterwards Henry\nreturned home on his bicycle. I was very pleased, also surprised,\nwhen he came back and told me what a feeling both him and our\nfriend Mr Statham had.\n\" [Signed] A. Schietekat.\"\nTHE KONNERSREUTH CASE.\nSome little time since Dr Josef Deutsch, of Lippstadt, Westphalia,\nsent Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo, who had reviewed a\nbooklet of his on Konnersreuth {Proceedings, xli. 250), an article\nfrom his pen on the same subject. The article in question was very\nunfavourable to the stigniatica's claim. Count Perovsky then wrote\nto Professor G. Wunderle, of Wiirzburg University, a Catholic\npriest, with whom he had previously been in correspondence, asking\nhim to express his view of the present state of the Konnersreuth\ncase. A translation of Professor Wunderle's answer follows.\n\" I willingly answer your friendly letter of 27.10.33.\n\" Dr Deutsch has also sent to me his article '\nAllerlei iiber Konners-\nreuth '\n(Die Hochwarte, 13.10.33, no. 9). As in his other writings he\nthere discusses the '\nKonnersreuth case '\nfrom a purely medical\npoint of view. He has always admitted, however, that this cannot\nbe the sole method of treatment. Seeing that even from the\nmedical standpoint alone such serious, I will even say conclusive\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1933\ndoubts, must be expressed against Konnersreuth, scepticism\nregarding the supernatural nature of the case is well-founded. As\nyou know I have constantly raised yet other objections. These\nhave not been meanwhile disposed of, at any rate so far as I know.\nTherese Neumann, in my opinion also, should certainly have allowed\nherself to be scientifically investigated. From this view I cannot\ndepart, and I regret that this has not been done. The circumstances\nwhich led to the neglect or the prevention of the investigation are\ncertainly very regrettable. When we asked for the verdict of\nscience we were all animated by the most honorable motives.\nThe severe insults heaped upon us did not induce us to renounce\nour wishes. We acted in the interest of the Church, and Therese\nNeumann ought also to have complied with the Bishops' desire in\nthe Church's interest. As she did not do so she certainly did not\nimprove the Konnersreuth situation scientifically speaking. She\nhas not had good advisers. Now everything is quiet at Konners-\nreuth ; one hardly hears of it, and it is well that it should be so.\nIn Catholic life there are things infinitely more weighty than\nKonnersreuth. May that quiet persist !\n\"\nProfessor Wunderle adds that he has no objection to the printing\nof his letter.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nTelepathy and Survival.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014Dr Osty's researches in the field of metagnomy published\nin his \" Telepathie spontanee et transmission de pensee experi-\nmentale \", so ably and interestingly reviewed by Mr Soal in the\nNovember Journal, clearly justifies the cautious attitude of the\nS.P.R. in recent years towards mediumistic communications pur-\nporting to come from discarnate sources. At the same time it is\nobvious that no positive evidence of the falseness of all discarnate\ncommunications has been adduced. In fact the proof that the\nliving mind can have access to memories, in seeming to point to\nthe survival of memories (as Mr Soal shows), suggests that minds\nmust survive to make use of them, and not only of them, otherwise\nlife and survival would both be farcical. It is hard to believe (to\nparaphrase Professor William James) that BUNK is written in large\nletters across one of the most deep-seated and wide-spread beliefs\nof the human race.\nYours, etc.,\nErnest S. Thomas.\n\fDecember 1933 Revieiv 159\nREVIEW.\nProf. Hans Driesch, Psychical Research. Translated by Theodore\nBesterman. 8vo, pp. xvi. 175. London : G. Bell and Sons,\nLtd., 1933. Price 5s. net.\nProfessor Driesch has written a book which, despite certain\nlimitations, should be read by all who wish to take psychical\nresearch seriously.\nAs a philosopher he is naturally and rightly interested in the\nmethodology of the subject and a great part of the work is occupied\nwith an attempt to exhibit the logical framework within which, as\nit were, the pieces of the puzzle must be fitted together, and with\nconsidering what fundamentally new concepts would be involved\nby the admission of this or that alleged phenomenon to the status\nof fact. Such work is of fundamental importance.\nOn the interpretative side, Professor Driesch is non-committal,\nthough his avowed support of \" vitalism \" (growing more respectable\nalmost daily) naturally predisposes him to animistic views. Accept-\ning telepathy at least as irrefutably proven, he appears to hesitate,\nas regards supernormal communications from ostensibly discarnate\nentities, between a peculiar version of the Cosmic Consciousness\nhypothesis and true \" spiritism \", or \" monadism \" as he prefers to\ncall it. The former view, which I find very repellent, appears to\npostulate a \" cosmic subject \" independent of the incarnate con-\nsciousness we know and equipped with an indefinitely large number\nof \" catalogues \" and \" plans \" to which clairvoyants and \" meta-\ngnomes \" (Professor Driesch's word for mediums) have access.\nThis may appeal to those who like to think in terms of akashic\nrecords, but otherwise (if the word is applicable) it would seem\nto have few merits. As I have explained elsewhere, I find it almost\nimperative and not at all difficult to suppose that all consciousnesses\nshare a common \" subterconsciousness \" (to coin yet another term)\nby virtue of which some measure of inter-communication may take\nplace, but the idea of this detached cosmic encyclopaedia seems in\nthe last degree fantastic and uncalled for by the facts.\nIt is not quite clear whether \" The Impossibility of a Definite\nConclusion \" as regards these two hypotheses is regarded as being\ninherent in the problem or as referring only to the present state of\nour knowledge. If the former is intended, then the possibility of\napplying to self-styled spirits the psychological equivalents of\nBertillon measurements, as Mr Hereward Carrington has recently\nessayed to do, has been overlooked.\nProfessor Driesch seems to have been singularly well served by\nhis translator, who has infused lucidity into an originally difficult\npiece of work ; but an index of subjects as well as of names would\nnave been valuable. Whately Carington.\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1933\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nProceedings of the American Society for Psychical Research, vols, xx-\nxxi.\n[In earlier times a juryman was such for the very reason that he\nwas a neighbour to and had much personal knowledge of the facts\nof the case. This is the position of the writer. While he cannot\nconceive that, had his knowledge been derived only from the books\nnamed above, his opinion of them would have differed materially,\nundoubtedly that opinion is fortified by a multitude of facts known\nto him but not revealed in the volumes and quite unknown to the\ninterested public. But there will here be made no use of these facts,\nexcept for brief references to certain documents of which the writer\nhas copies, the originals being in the possession of those responsible\nfor the books which are to be criticized.\nThe titlepages announce the books (comprising all the Proceedings\nfrom 1926 to 1933) both as Volumes XX-XXI and as Volumes (not\nparts) 1-2. They are \" for the years 1926-1927 \", yet a third of\nVol. 2 concerns 1928-1929. The preface of Vol. 1 says that they\nwill constitute \" a complete record \", but they do not, since the\nmassive material relating to the thumb prints is postponed for\nsome future volume. Other matter promised by Bird will be\nsought in Vol. 2 in vain, such as the mysterious \" open references\n\"\nand the promised Appendix (15 n.). The list of authors of the\nchapters in Vol. 2 forgets that Dr Hamilton wrote Chapter 48 (492).\nAny one who desires to refer conveniently to plates must make his\nown list. Such samples of inexactitude are of interest, since those\nresponsible for them also edited the case material (492) and were\nconspicuous in the actual investigation.\nVolume 1 was wholly edited and mostly written by J. Malcolm\nBird. His book of 1924, My Psychic Adventures, shows no lack of\nearnestness and confidence, but in the Banner of Life, 8 August\n1925, he admitted that it was merely \" a human document, with\nno scientific implications \". In 1925 appeared his Margery the\nMedium, written with an unsurpassable tone of authority and\nassumption of ability to detect the mental and moral delinquencies\nof every man with whose opinions he was in conflict. But in\nVol. 1 under consideration criticism forces him to admit that\nMargery the Medium was \" written from a journalistic viewpoint . . .\nand judged from severe scientific standards has certain obvious\nshortcomings \" (1). Since, aside from a somewhat more orderly\narrangement and the disuse of melodramatic chapter-titles, the\n\" obvious shortcomings \" continue, it was expected that Bird would\nin Vol. 2 ask leniency for Vol. 1. But two years ere that appeared\nhe had resigned as Research Officer, with an eloquent philippic of\n\fDecember 1933 Notes on Periodicals 161\nprotest against what he pronounced lay and determined spiritualistic\ndomination. It remained for the \" general editorial supervision\n\"\n(492) of Vol. 2 not to plead for leniency to him, but to denounce\nhim for such qualities as must by necessary implication, if they\nexisted, have laid all his previous writing on the case under sus-\npicion. More than three years before his resignation Bird observed,\nas he believed, indications of fraud, which he ignored in Vol. 1,\nprinted a year later. The report embodying these observations\nwas not suffered to be printed in Vol. 2 until it had been edited and\ndeodorized by another hand. Aside from this, the long paper which\nhe furnished for Vol. 2, exhibiting what he called \" the oblique\naspects of the mediumship \", was rejected with loathing. \" Bird's\nopinion and conclusions were rejected as unsound and impossible\nand the article as biassed and unworthy of publication \" (651 n.).\nThe very fact that he professed to find a factor of fraud from the\nbeginning up to the thumb-prints, which he thought genuine (!),\nwas suppressed. But will it be credited that a man who could in\n1929 write some sixty pages of \" unsound and impossible \" material,\n\" biassed and unworthy of publication \", was quite free from such\ntendencies earlier, when he wrote Vol. 1 ? Considering that in 1929\nhe cited in his support critics of the case (just so far as their testi-\nmony supported his altered views) whose evidence he had earlier\nderided and condemned, it seems probable that his biasses had but\nchanged their direction.\nVolume 1 is saturated with two major faults. The first may be\nintroduced by Bird's own statement :\n\" My mental life revolves\nmuch more about words than does that of the average person. . . .\nI am constantly doing mental tricks with them \" (Psychic Research,\nxxii. 273). And that habit accompanies all his writing on psychic\nresearch. Such is his wizardry with words that he would (110-13)\npersuade the unwary reader that the pamphlet Margery-Harvard-\nVeritas was not anonymous and that it did truly allege that the\nrecords of the Harvard Group were exactly reprinted therein. But\nsuch verbiage will not stand analysis (see Bulletin XIX, B.S.P.R.,\n60-61).\nThere are many instances of insinuation, favourable or derogatory.\nWe may not agree to the proposition (141) that if 95 per cent, of a\nmediumship is open to no conceivable attack \" we are logically\ncompelled to concede that the suspicious 5 per cent, is genuine\n\"\n(apply that formula to chemical analysis !). But the insinuation is\nthat this is the status of the Margery case, and it is an untrue one.\nAnd here is an example of the insinuation derogatory : \"Of course,\nPrince insists . . . that his inability to get on with the Crandons is\nentirely their fault \" (143 n.). The reader is left with the notion\nthat Prince had had friction with the Crandons during the sittings\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1933\nand admitted this, but denied that he was responsible, whereas\nthere was never a shadow of a single such incident nor ever one\ncharged. He simply could not continue sittings because of pro-\nhibitive conditions (Bulletin XIX, B.S.P.R., 55).\nThe second major fault is the almost unprecedented ingenuity\nand persistency of attack upon the mental and moral character of\npersons whose judgments were unpleasing. I here but quote one\nsentence from Bulletin XIX, B.S.P.R. :\n\" That all of a certain\nman's express forensic opponents, irrespective of previous rank,\nstation and reputation, should be subject to condemnation, and\nthat it should be possible to determine that all others who murmur\ndissent from his opinion bear the like stamp of malignity or mental\nimpotence is quite incredible.\"\nVolume 2 is a curiously syndicated and stratified piece of work.\nBird declares that he had edited approximately all the material\nsupposed to enter it, rewriting parts on demand. Yet no credit\nwhatever is given him (492). It is probable that the chapters\nascribed to Dudley have been so effectually done over as to be justly\ncalled his, aside from such alterations as the \" general editorial\nsupervision \" saw fit to make without consulting him. His chapters\nare devoid of personal detraction, insinuation and verbal tortuosity,\nthe material is mainly record and description, and, if at times too\ntrustful of appearances, there are also certain reticences which\nwould escape the careless reader and perhaps escaped the \" general\neditorial supervision \" itself. Chapter 46, said to be by Walton\n(a trustee of the A.S.P.R.), is like Bird in its abuse of investigators\nand its verbal ingenuity. The chapters by Richardson are highly\nunsatisfactory in spite of their superficial appearance, either\nbecause of tenuous connections between facts and conclusions or of\nlarge gaps in the evidence, particularly as to the conditions of the\nexperiments.\nRemarks about phenomena must be very brief because of the\nsmall space allotted and are chosen almost at random from 840\npages. Chapter 3 on \" Walter's '\nTalking Head ' \" may be interest-\ning, but it is scientifically valueless. It concerns certain luminous\neffects with which imagination could play. Dr Crandon said there\nwas presented \" a definite skull with jaws open \" and that \" all\nsaw it \", Bird less clearly. Bird says he saw no skull at all, \" nothing\nmore than vague striations in the faintly luminous mass.\" Nor did\nthe head talk. The subsequent \" talking head \" (which also was\nnot proved to talk) is certainly not a skull and the reader can judge\nfrom the plates (nos. 14-19) how much like a head it is. The\nphotographs would present the same appearance whether the\n\" appendage \" had issued from or was, as Bird perhaps inadvertently\nputs it on plate 14, \" thrust up into the nose \", nor do they show\n\fDecember 1933 Notes on Periodicals 163\nwhether the smaller extension is a \" psychic cord \" or a thread stout\nenough to bear the weight of the \" mass \" as in plate 19.\nThe \" Teleplasmic Hand,\" Chapter 5, is equally worthless, partly\nbecause apparently founded solely on accounts by Crandon, who\nBird admits is not reliable (282), and who in fact is capable of much\nembroidery or even of compounding the unimpressive events of\nseven dates into one stupendous evening (Bulletin XIX, B.S.P.R.,\n63-4). But the Doctor describes the \" hand \" as \" closely re-\nsembling the hands of the Dingwall sittings \", the same which two\nHarvard experts said were undoubtedly cut out of the lung tissue\nof some animal. The Doctor adds that \" it was very lovely\n\"\nand the reader can see how beautiful it was from the plates in\nProceedings S.P.R., xxxvi, showing the closely resembling earlier\nhand.\nThe \" Voice Machine \" (Chapters 20, 21, etc.), upon which the\nmedium had months of opportunity to practise before it was brought\ninto seance use, is not convincing. The writer invented a little trick\nwith his fingers which no one can perform without the weeks of\npractice it cost him. He spoke several words at the only moment\nhe ever tried the machine (282) and another man did better at a\nlater date, both talking and whistling (275). How much of the\ninterval between the latter date and that of exhibiting an improved\nmouthpiece to pose beginners was employed in practice we do not\nknow. But we do know that Crandon has steadily refused to allow\na stethoscope to be placed on the medium's throat or breast-bone,\nalthough besought to do so by a then believing agent of the A.S.P.R.\nWhat possible reason for this refusal except that the stethoscope\nwould tell the source of the \" independent voice \" ?\nThere are a number of pleasant nuances to be found, as the state-\nment (79) that on a certain occasion Walter's voice, not in connection\nwith the machine, had \" all its habitual effect of coming from the\nimmediate vicinity of the Psychic's head \" [italics sic]. Another is\nin the caption to plate 13, \" showing mass of teleplasm upstanding\nfrom the psychic's head, apparently supported in normal fashion at\ntop of cabinet \" [my italics]. Another concerns sittings when Car-\ntheuser, the shady physical medium, was present, his phenomena\nmingling with Margery's, and Walter's voice \" seemed more like a\nmale voice than at any other seance \" (552). Still another is found\nin Bird's observation that of all investigators, \" I am in the unique\nposition of not having any urge toward the rapid promulgation of\nfinal views of some sort.\" The humour of this can be appreciated\nin the light of his statement in Margery the Medium (438) that he\nbecame utterly convinced by the time he had reached his twelfth\nsitting and by his admission in the Scientific American of August\n1924, written when he had had 22 more sittings, that \" mani-\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1933\nfestations have not yet occurred in our presence under full test\nconditions \".\nChapter 47 manifests as much confidence in Cartheuser's pheno-\nmena as in those of Margery. Yet the \" general editorial super-\nvision \" knew that their own agent caught Cartheuser in fraud and\nforced him to make confession before one of the writers of Vol. 2.\nLater Cartheuser was \" available \" for sittings in the rooms of\nthe A.S.P.K. (Psychic Research, November 1930).\nMuch could be said regarding the glass cabinet, bell-box and\nreading-in-the-dark tests. But is it not enough to quote Professor\nMcComas, for six months or more (in 1926) a salaried agent of the\nA.S.P.R. ? So much impressed that he offered to bet Code that he\ncould not reproduce the Margery phenomena, the latter scorned\nthe mercenary factor but invited him to see what could be done.\nAnd \" Professor Grant H. Code, of the University of Delaware,\nreproduced the levitation effects excellently ; he also reproduced\nthe bell-box effect and the reading of the cards in the dark \" (743).\nMcComas similarly lashed Code in an essentially similar cabinet.\nConsequently McComas declared that he would bet the same sum\nthat anything done in the Margery circle could be done by Code,\nwith no takers.\nWalton, in Chapter 56, continues the attack of Chapter 31 upon\nWood, a leading physicist, and his two psychologist colleagues,\nforming an A.S.P.R. commission for investigation. His first and\nprolonged complaint is that Professor Dunlap had previously\nwritten books expressing opinions unfavourable to Spiritualism\nand he laments that, mindful of the maxim caveat emptor (717), the\npsychologist's career had not been antecedently scrutinized to\nmake sure it was untainted. But, then, even McComas turned\nheretic.\nLet us sample the oddities of this chapter. Wood is reproached\n(727-9) for violating on 30 January the preliminary stipulation that\n\" no psychic structure shall be touched or interfered with in any\nway \" when he \" pinched \" the solid rod and discovered that it was\nheld in the psychic's mouth. But the record of that evening shows\nthat it was the medium herself who brought the hand of every\ninvestigator into contact with the rod (380), that when McComas\nreported that he had squeezed it gently and there was no complaint,\nWood squeezed it harder, that there was still no complaint and\nthat phenomena went merrily on. Crandon charged that \" cata-\nmenia came at once after the sitting \", with the implication that\nWood's brutal squeeze caused it, and yet there is printed (724) the\nstenographer's statement that the medium was unwell before the\nsitting and Crandon knew it (382). Walton, evidently crediting\nthe disastrous consequences of the \" pinch \", after a visit to Boston\n\fDecember 1933 Notes on Periodicals 165\nreported to McComas that the medium had \" been ill in bed for the\nlast two weeks \" immediately following the crime (729). And he\nreiterates in the book that she \" in the meantime was seriously ill\ntwo weeks \" (728). Yet it is an incontrovertible fact that she had\nthree lively sittings on February 3, 4 and 6, when she was con-\nstructively ill in bed or at least seriously ill ! Dr Crandon indeed\nsays in one place that she was in bed four days, but insists upon her\nprotracted illness (732). Still further to emphasize the tragedy\nof 30 January, it is alleged by Crandon that before the medium\ncould leave the room she vomited on the floor. The three university\nprofessors declare that after the medium, as they believed, simulated\nvomiting and left the room they examined the floor and there was\nnothing on it. Both Bird (384) and Walton (746-7) expect the\nreader to believe that Crandon, whose dramatizing talents are well-\nknown to them, is the only honest man of the four. The signing\nby the Commissioners at a later date of the record ending with the\nstatement, \" There was nausea and vomiting of the Psychic after\nthe sitting \", is of no consequence. They doubtless supposed an\nevent after their departure was meant and that it was understood\nthat this statement rested on the word of the Crandons, exactly\nas did the immediately previous statement upon that of the steno-\ngrapher. Other of the efforts in Chapters 31 and 56 by officers of\nthe A.S.P.R. to impeach their own Commissioners are as rickety\nas Bird's evidence that Code never could have had an alleged solus\nsitting with Margery ;\nnamely, the affidavit of a woman that he\ndid not have such a sitting on a date which she does not remember\nand, therefore, cannot know is the date which he names (103).\nChapter 57 is reprinted as it stood in Psychic Research, without\nnoticing Besterman's drastic remarks on the futility of the attempt\nto demonstrate the independence of the Walter mentality by\nhypnosis and on the suspicious character of the \" dead horse\n\"\ncross-correspondence (see Proceedings S.P.R., Part 110). The\nother \" cross-correspondences \", whether with Valiantine of shady\nreputation, or others, are liable to similar criticism.

F. Johnston, in Psychic Science (April 1929), declared\nthat it could not be from Confucius or of ancient origin, that it\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1933\nconsisted in fact of quotations from a book familiar to Chinese of\nany education, etc. A reply in the same issue disclaimed holding\nthat Confucius had anything to do with the writing and modestly\ndeclared :\n\" We have presented no claims in connection with these\nscripts other than the fact of their production under controlled con-\nditions, which, we believe, establish their supernormality.\" Such\nbeing the only claim left and the guarantors having asserted with\nmore emphasis that the Walter thumb prints, since demonstrated\nto be those of a living man, were also secured against fraud by the\nstrict conditions, what assurance is there that there was not sub-\nstitution of previously prepared sheets for those scribbled upon\nduring the sittings ? A Chinaman could have detected the differ-\nence but no Chinaman assisted, except after sittings to make\ninexpert translations. One evening a sheaf of sheets was marked\nby Richardson for identification and he thought (many have\nerroneously thus thought) that he by this means was able to identify\nthem. But how were they marked ? In any way difficult to\nimitate ? Did Richardson obtain them in the Crandon house % If\nnot, were they furnished in advance of the sitting, giving time to\nprocure other like sheets ? These are a few out of the questions\nwhich have had no answers. For some reason, on this particular\nevening, whatever was done to the sheets was done in the dark.\nWhy ?\nThe book reprints the original Chinese material, as though Sir R.\nJohnston never existed, leaves the reader under the impression that\nConfucius (815) and other ancients (811) actually communicated,\nfails to admit that the quotations are from a very well-known\nChinese book and reiterates that its \" ideas . . . bear the hall-mark\nof '\noriginal ' Chinese literature which is accessible only in one or\ntwo libraries in this country \" (818).\nThe Margery case has boxed the entire compass of types of\nphysical and mental mediumship, genuine or spurious, and has added\nnew types. This does not necessarily imply remarkable human\npersistence and ingenuity ; it might imply that Walter is the most\nversatile spirit genius who has ever manifested. But such a gifted\nspirit ought to know that truth does not walk with cautious tread\nand does not hide from the face of any man, but demands inspection,\neven by the doubtful and the yet unbelieving. Such a spirit should\nbe quite aware that by screening out all but believing or subsidized\nobservers, by screening out, so far as possible, all but complaisant\ntestimony and affirmative documents, a good impression is not\nproduced upon logical human minds. Such a spirit would be\nexpected to shun the conventions and taboos which were originally\ninvented to protect fraud, to consent gladly to every test suggested\nby common-sense and generally to react in as rational a fashion\n\fDecember 193.\"?

M. White\nThe ceremony of \" Fire Walking \" which I saw took place at a\nspot on the outskirts of the town of Suva, Viti Levu, Fiji Islands,\non a Sunday afternoon early in July 1932. On the Sunday morning\nI saw a notice, posted in the Indian quarter of the town, that a\ntheatrical performance would be given, by the Madrassi people from\nSouthern India, on the Saturday evening, and that a \" Fire Walk-\ning \" ceremony would take place on the Sunday afternoon. On\nenquiry I found that the ceremony would take place near a tenqole\nwhich stood some distance down the road towards Nausori on the\nRewa river.\n\fJanuary L934 A \"Fire Walking\" Ceremony 171\nI was shown the way to the temple by two Indians, both of the\npoorer class : an old Brahmin, and a young Indian who spoke\nEnglish. The temple was very hard to reach, except by taking a\nfootpath across the golf links, and at the entrance to each footpath\na Fijian police constable was stationed, who prevented my Indian\ncompanions from passing. They were very indignant and said to\nme, \" You see how we are treated when we are going to a most\nimportant religious ceremony \" . I mention this because the remark\nseems to make it clear that they looked on the whole affair as a\nreligious ceremony and not as a show.\nWe eventually reached the place where the ceremony was held,\nafter scrambling through bushes and along tracks which were\ntrampled into deep soft mud. The slipperiness and the mud show\nthat there had been fairly heavy rain not very long before, but on\nthe actual day of the ceremony there was not, so far as I can re-\nmember, any rain, or at the most one or two light showers in the\nmorning and no rain in the afternoon. The sky was rather overcast,\nand I do not think that there was any bright sunshine during the\nceremony.\nThe spot where the \" Fire Walking \" ceremony took place stood\non the opposite side of a ravine from an Indian village, and the pit\ncontaining the fire stood nearly between an open-air stage, on which\nthe theatrical performance had taken place the previous day, and a\nsmall wooden temple, or rather shrine, which I was allowed to look\ninto but not to enter.\nThe \" Fire Walking \" took place in a large pit, which was, I\nshould say, about fifteen feet wide by forty-five feet long, and which\nwas filled to within a few inches of the top with wood ashes. The\npit stood in a roped-off enclosure, of such a size that there was\nperhaps three or four yards' width of turf on either side of the pit,\nabout double that width at one end where the \" Fire Walkers\n\"\nentered, and a space five or six times as large at the other end.\nFijian and Indian spectators, both men and women, were standing\ntwo or three deep all around the enclosure, except at the entrance,\nand where there was a rough shelter, opposite the middle of the pit.\nThis shelter, which was just a roof on four posts, held several rows\nof chairs, occupied by Indian spectators, and by the few white people\nwho were present, half a dozen sailors from a warship, and six or\nseven other white men and women. I myself squeezed on to a chair\nat the end of the second row, next to a prosperous-looking Brahmin\ngentleman, who told me that the ceremony took place only once a\nyear, and that I was thus very fortunate to see it. He explained to\nme that the bed of ashes had been prepared by kindling in the pit\nten tons of wood (formerly twenty tons were used, but now, owing\nto the depression, the amount was reduced). The wood was lighted\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1934\nat such, a time before the ceremony that it would just have burned\nto ashes before the \" Fire Walking \" took place. The timing must\nhave been judged fairly accurately, as, just before the ceremony,\nalthough the greatest part of the wood had been reduced to ashes,\nthere were still a few small logs left, which, it is interesting to notice,\nwere carefully raked out of the pit before the ceremony began.\nENTRANCE\nI\nI\n1\nI\nENCLOSURE\nTEMPLE\nI\n~~\ni\nj\nSTAND\n]\n1 I\nWhilst we were waiting, the Brahmin explained to me that pre-\nparation was essential if one' was to walk across the pit unharmed.\nHe said that anyone could do the \" Fire Walking \" if they went\nthrough the proper ritual, but that no one could walk across unless\nthey had done so. I do not think, however, that he meant that the\npreparation was purely mechanical ; one had, I imagine, got to have\na good deal of faith in the ritual. The preparation consisted of a fast\nof fourteen days, with, I think, religious rites, during which the\nparticipants lived at the temple, and at the conclusion of which they\nhad to walk down to the sea, here about three miles away, bathe in\nit, and then walk back again. I understood that both the fast and\nthe bathe in the sea were essential.\nBefore the return of the \" Fire Walkers \" there came out two men\nwearing masks, and with their bodies painted, otherwise naked\nexcept for a girdle, who danced beside the pit, dancing with the\nmost furious energy, so that the perspiration streamed off them.\nThese men did not, however, so far as I saw, walk through the pit.\nThen there was a stir of excitement round the entrance ; some\n\fJanuary 1934 A \"Fire Walking\" Ceremony 173\nattendants ran to thrust back the people to make room for the\n\" Fire Walkers \" to enter, another ran with a pole and hooked out\nof the pit a small log which still lay burning there.\nA minute or two later the procession of the \" Fire Walkers\n\"\nappeared, led by a priest in a tall round pointed brown hat (like a\nfool's cap), and carrying a brass dish on which there was some\nfruit and a pile of brown powder. The other \" Fire Walkers \" came\nstraggling in behind him, most of them looking very exhausted, and\nsupported by a man on either side ; but even the most exhausted\nof them seemed to regain their strength at the sight of the pit, and\nwere able to leave their helpers and to walk steadily and firmly.\nThey did not walk through the pit one by one, but in irregular order,\nand it was interesting to notice that at the beginning the priest and\nthree or four others came up to the edge of the pit at the same time,\nand that when they got there, there was a most marked moment of\nhesitation until the priest took his courage into his hands and\nstepped on to the ashes, after which the others all seemed to lose\ntheir nervousness. All those participating walked through the pit\nat least once, and some of them turned at the other end and\nwalked back again, a good many walking through three or\nmore times. They walked quite slowly, and did not show any\nsign of discomfort or pain, or any apparent wish to hurry. Most of\nthem walked in the ordinary way on the surface of the ashes, into\nwhich their feet sank as they would have sunk into any other bed of\nsoft wood ashes, but I particularly remember seeing one man, who\nhad already walked through once, walking through again in a state\nof seeming ecstasy, ploughing his feet down into the ashes as deeply\nas he could at each step, so that his feet were covered over.\nThe men who walked through the pit wore only a cotton loin\ncloth each, arranged in the ordinary Indian manner, and coming\npart of the way down their thighs. The loin cloths appeared to be\nwet from the sea bathing, and did not show any noticeable signs of\nscorching when I saw some of the men at close quarters afterwards.\nI think, though I do not remember very distinctly, that the priest\nwore a brown coat as well as a loin cloth.\nDuring the ceremony I noticed a number of men who had silver\nskewers stuck through their cheeks and other fleshy parts of their\nbodies, the wounds from which did not bleed or appear to cause them\nany discomfort. I think that these men were some of those who\nwalked through the pit, and had undergone the preparation.\nAt the end of the ceremony, a man came round with the brass\ntray which the priest had carried, and gave pinches of the brown\npowder to those Hindus who asked for it. A portion was given to\nthe Brahmin next to me, and he put it carefully away in a little box,\nand seemed to look on it as precious. A small and not very happy-\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1934\nlooking little girl was also led, or rather almost dragged, round the\npit ; I am not sure why this was done, though one man did tell me\nthat she had been ill, and that it was to make her better.\nAfter the \" Fire Walking \" was over, I was able to look at the\npit from close at hand ; the ashes were white on the surface, and did\nnot glow red, though this may be accounted for in part by the fact\nthat it was fairly bright daylight, though there was no direct sun-\nlight. They were certainly exceedingly hot. To stand down-wind\nfrom the pit was like standing near a furnace. Standing on the up-\nwind side, at the edge, I found that if I held out my bare hand over\nthe pit, at about the level of my chin (that is about five feet nine\ninches above the level of the ashes), I was only able to keep it there\nmomentarily before the heat began to burn it. I also tried dropping\nbits of paper into the pit. Scraps of newspaper burst into flames as\nsoon as they touched the ashes, and bits of brown wrapping paper\nturned black, smouldered and shrivelled up, without actually burst-\ning into flames.\nI also saw some of the people who had passed through the pit.\nThe feet of the first man whom I saw were covered with mud, but\nhis legs did not appear to be in any way injured.\nTwo other men whom I saw had washed their feet and I was able\nto look at them closely. Their legs and feet did not show any signs\nof burns or blisters, and the delicate skin about the base of the toes,\non the upper surface of the foot, which would certainly have been\nin contact with the ashes into which their feet had sunk, seemed\nquite normal. The under surface of the feet was rather white in\ncolour, though perhaps not more so than I had noticed with Fijian\nporters, after they had walked long distances through rivers and\nalong muddy bush tracks. The under surface of the feet seemed also\nto have a somewhat softened appearance, such as one may notice\nwith one's own feet after fairly prolonged bathing in very hot water.\nNone of them seemed to suffer any inconvenience in walking, or to\nshow any signs of discomfort or distress. It was also noticeable\nthat though the \" Fire Walkers \" had looked very exhausted\nwhen they reached the pit after walking up from the sea, yet\nwhen I saw them after the ceremony they did not seem to be\nparticularly exhausted.\nThe Fijian people present seemed to have a very great respect for\nthe heat of the pit. One six feet tall young man was standing beside\nme at the edge of the pit, and I indicated to him that he should walk\ninto it. He stepped back hastily, and gave me to understand by\ngestures that he was most certainly not going to do so.\nLooking back on the ceremony, I feel convinced that the events\nhappened as I have described, and that they cannot be explained\naway by any suggestion of mass hypnotism. I think, too, that the\n\fJanuary 1934 Correspondence 175\nheat of the pit was so great that no ordinary man could have stepped\ninto it without being badly burned. An iron bar or a piece of coke\nwhich is hot enough to cause a piece of newspaper to burst into\nflames is certainly far above the lowest temperature which would\ncause a serious burn even with only momentary contact, whilst,\nalthough wood ash has probably a low thermal conductivity, the\n\" Fire Walkers \" were in the pit for half a minute or more at a time.\nIn view of the length of time that they were in the pit, I do not\nthink that the result was affected by the fact that their feet were\nwet from walking over muddy paths, and that their bodies may have\nbeen damp with perspiration. In any case it was pure chance that\nthere had been rain recently enough to leave the paths wet.\nIt may perhaps not be out of place here to mention that the\nnatives of one of the islands of the Fiji group give shows in which\nthey walk about on hot stones. This is only a show, and I under-\nstand that it has no religious significance. I have not seen it, but\nI have been told that it does not in any way compare with the \" Fire\nWalking \" described above. I have also been told, though this\nis pure hearsay, that the Fijians protect themselves by painting\ntheir feet with some decoction of their own.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nOn the Possibility of Proving Survival\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014I fear that I must beg leave again to trespass on your space\nto thank Dr Rhine and your other correspondents for their com-\nments on my letter in the issue for June last.\nMay I say, first of all, that I sincerely hope that Dr Rhine is right\nand that I am wrong, although at the present moment I am not\nconvinced that it is so. As regards Dr Rhine's first point, viz. my\nview that conviction on the matter of survival must always depend\non individual idiosyncrasy, he is willing to admit that there is at\npresent a large element of this involved. Where we differ is in our\nestimation of the relative size of that element and the hopes of\nreducing it. From the fact that I have devoted, and still continue\nto devote, a good deal of time and labour to the study of psychical\nresearch it is obvious that I do not hold the view that no advance in\nscientific knowledge is possible in this sphere, but I very much fear\nthat that advance must be so slow and small that conviction one\nway or the other will continue for as long as it is possible for us to\nforesee to be determined by other factors.\nTouching the two variables which, as I believe, determine con-\nviction, antecedent acceptability or otherwise need not and in fact\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1934\nin many cases is not a matter of unscientific belief. There are many\nfor whom the antecedent inacceptability of survival is based mainly\non physiological considerations. Were psychical research the sole\nscientific factor we should doubtless be constrained to do our utmost\nto permit it to determine our conviction without let or hindrance\nfrom any other source ; but it is not so : psychology, physiology,\netc., insist on being heard, in fact sometimes claim superiority of\nauthority. Moreover, even those entirely unscientific hopes and\nfears of which I spoke are not altogether to be neglected by the most\naustere scientist ;\nthey themselves may be susceptible of scientific\ntreatment.\nThe second variable arises from the fact that up to now no\nevidence has been forthcoming which is not susceptible of alternative\nexplanations, at least that is my opinion. My main thesis was that,\nso far as one could judge, unequivocal evidence of survival was\nextremely unlikely to occur. I agree with Dr Rhine in rejecting the\nword \" impossible \" ; if I have unwittingly given the impression\nthat I consider impossibilities to be possible I most humbly apologise.\nI regard dogmatism as the unforgivable sin. It may be that the\nperfect case will be found at some future date, when the matter will\nbe settled one way or the other once and for all. It may be so, but\nI doubt it.\nIn my reply to Sir Oliver Lodge I sketched my idea of the nearest\napproach to such a case of which I could think, yet it was full of\nloopholes. Of course it is possible that some entirely new type of\nevidence may be found ; it may also be that as the result of further\nresearch we shall be able to discover the conditions of occurrence, the\nlimitations and scope of action of telepathy, clairvoyance, etc., and\nthus be able to estimate more accurately the relative probabilities\nof the alternative explanations. It may be so\u2014I hope it will be so\n\u2014\nbut I am rather doubtful. However, until this has been done I\nconsider that evaluation of the relative probabilities is and must be\na matter of individual idiosyncrasy. As I have said, I wish that\nI could think otherwise. As regards Dr Rhine's second point\nI need say little. I agree that if we can find evidence of new\nconative activity it is of the highest importance because it\ngoes to disprove all theories based on persistence of memory\nor mnemic fragments. I laid stress on this point in my report\non the Warren Elliott sittings. But as evidence of identity this\nnew purpose must be recognisable as being appropriate to the\nostensible communicator, and how else may this be done than by\nshowing it to be all of a piece with his character as manifested in his\nhabitual forms of thought and associations of ideas ? Dr Rhine, in\nhis original article, says, page 37, \" It requires, of course, a basis of\nevidence of mere fact which will establish supernormality first and\n\fJandaht 1934 Correspondence 111\nidentify the personality as well \". I take it we are in agreement\nhere ;\nhowever, I think it possible that he puts a considerably narrower\nmeaning on my phrase than I do myself. Under habitual forms of\nthought I would include practically the whole mental and moral\ncharacter, all that mentation which precedes and largely determines\naction.\nThe third point whereon controversy arises is my treatment of his\nimaginary case. Perhaps I did dismiss it with rather scant courtesy,\nbut I can plead the most honourable motives for doing so, to wit, the\ndesire to keep as short as possible an already too lengthy letter and\na diffidence to parade my views too extensively before your readers.\nUnder the circumstances which have now arisen, however, I must\novercome my natural modesty and attempt to analyse the case in a\nmanner which will not bear the reproach of \" piecemeal \".\nIt is not stated whether the wife was supposed to know that the\nsitting was to take place at that time. If one assumes that she did\nknow, it is quite conceivable that she might unconsciously convey\nby telepathy either to the medium or the sitter the knowledge of her\ncondition, which knowledge was in her subconscious mind. The\ntendency to dramatise which is so often exhibited might lead the\nmedium to produce this knowledge as a message from the deceased\nhusband. Given that the medium shared the ordinary spiritualistic\nbeliefs, this would be quite likely to happen. The \" adequate identi-\nfication \" which is given is, on this hypothesis, presumably derived\nfrom the same source, viz. the subconscious mind, of the wife.\nIf the wife was normally in ignorance of the sitting being held, we\nmust further postulate that she became subconsciously aware of\nthe fact either by telepathy from the sitter or the medium or else by\nclairvoyance on her own behalf.\nI admit that these suppositions may require an effort to swallow,\nbut they are not theoretically impossible. However, as I said in my\nprevious letter, the case is a good one and some ingenuity would be\nrequired to explain it away.\nThis tentative analysis, which I do not, of course, claim to be the\nonly one possible or even the most plausible, illustrates the im-\nportance of the question of what I have called linkage. It is on the\nmatter of the probability of the requisite linkages that individual\nopinion is liable so much to differ, at least this has been my experi-\nence.\nIt occurs to me that perhaps the root of the matter between us\nlies in my use of the word \" idiosyncrasy \", and this idea is streng-\nthened by the tone of Dr Ehine's concluding paragraphs and the\nfact that he associates the word \" prejudice \" with idiosyncrasy.\nNothing was further from my mind than any such association. I\nnever intended to suggest\u2014and I hope that the language which I\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1934\nused gave no hint of any such suggestion\u2014that conviction on this\nmatter was largely determined by prejudice. One would hardly\ndescribe the antecedent inacceptability of the survival hypothesis\nfelt by a convinced Behaviourist or a materialistic physiologist as\nprejudice. I should hesitate so to describe Prof. Dodds on the\none side (see his paper \" Why I do not believe in Survival \") and Sir\nOliver Lodge on the other.\nDr Rhine cites various scientific problems, viz. Lamarckian in-\nheritance, the corpuscular theory of light, etc., to which he says my\nremark that apodeictic proof is impossible applies \" in quite the same\nway but not in the same degree \" as it does to the problem of survival.\nI quite agree, but would point out that in all such problems the\nevidence is in the main confined to one branch of science, for example\nthe physicist in discussing the corpuscular theory is not subject to\nobjections from psychology or ethics, whereas on the matter of\nsurvival psychical research is only one among a number of relevant\nsciences. The problem of survival appears to me to partake more\nof the nature of metaphysics than of science proper.\nMoreover, in the case of most scientific problems there is an almost\ncomplete absence of personal feeling ; whether light be corpuscular\nor not may be of the highest interest, but the question hardly\ntouches our emotional nature, whereas our attitude towards survival\nhas repercussions on all our vital activities and interests. It is true\nthat emotion should not influence scientific judgment, but I think\nthat that is a counsel of perfection impossible of complete attain-\nment.\nAs I remarked at the outset, though Dr Rhine and I take rather\ndifferent views in the matter, my sympathies and desires are\nentirely with him and against myself.\nI am much obliged to Mr Irving for his letter. I now see that I\ndid not make it sufficiently clear what type of case I had in mind\nwhen propounding my very tentative suggestion as to the manner\nin which the personality of an ostensible communicator might be\nbuilt up. I was thinking of cases of the type of George Pelham in the\nPiper sittings.\nIt is quite obvious that in the case of Mr Irving's communicator\n\" Dora \", any process of synthetic construction would be unneces-\nsary, in fact impossible, seeing the character already existed fully\nformed in his mind.\nI am greatly indebted to him and Miss Dallas for bringing out this\npoint and thus showing a limitation of the possible scope of my\nsuggested hypothesis. I am by no means convinced that it has any\napplication at all ; it seemed to me to have a certain plausibility and\nI ventured to put it forward in order that it might be discussed and\nthereby either rejected or refined. It is therefore gratifying that\n\fJanuary 1934 Reviews 179\nthe process of refinement or rejection, whichever it turns out to be\nin the long run, has commenced.\nAs Miss Dallas acutely observes, one would expect practice to\nmake perfect in communicating as elsewhere, and it seems that\nabsence of this factor of gradual improvement in performance is\nrather a point against the spirit communication theory, though, in\nour ignorance of the conditions, it cannot have much weight.\nIn the second case cited by Miss Dallas it is possible that there\nwas already subconscious knowledge of the \" trouble \" which\ndeveloped six years later, though it seems rather a long shot. But\nthe foreknowledge exhibited in predicting a cure is \" a horse of quite\na different colour \". For some time past I have been making a close\nstudy of the phenomena of precognition and have arrived at certain\ntentative conclusions and formulated a rather speculative hypo-\nthesis. My report is now before the Reference Committee, so that\nfor the moment I must beg permission to refrain from making any\ncomment on this point.\nMay I conclude by again thanking all my correspondents. It is\nmainly by open discussion of topics such as these that we may hope\nto obtain progress.\nYours, etc.,\nH. F.

W. Graham had been made President of the Friends' Historical\nSociety for the year 1932-3, but did not live to complete his year of\noffice, or to deliver his Address at the Annual Meeting. This booklet\ncontains the material which he had collected for his Presidential\nAddress, and the manuscript, obviously unfinished, has been\nprinted with no more than the necessary minimum of editing. In\nan interesting Introduction Mr F. E. Pollard speaks of Graham's\nlongstanding interest in the S.P.R., his studies in the history of\nQuakerism and his profound concern for the quality of the Quaker\nministry, as shown in his two most notable books, The Faith of a\nQuaker and The Divinity in Man. In the latter book, George Fox's\nremarkable experiences are described and are not repeated here.\nIt is a curious fact that all the material that could be found came\nfrom a period before 1850, and mostly from the eighteenth century,\nand nearly all of it comes from America, from the Eastern seaboard\nStates, which was the Quaker America of those days. \" The final\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1934\ndate (writes Graham) roughly coincides with, the change in ministry\nfrom the quietist type, where the instrument handed himself over to\nan unseen inspirer and shunned the use of his own powers or his own\ninitiative, to the easier standards, the more conversational and more\nmentally prepared ministry of to-day. This drives me to the thought\nthat though we have gained something intellectually, in consecutive\ntreatment and width of interest, in genuine grappling with our needs\nand in simple helpfulness, we have also lost something in penetrating\npower, in Divine endowment, in the strength that comes from for-\ngetting ourselves \".\nThe telepathic and other phenomena \" are plainly connected with\nthe rest of the ministerial endowment of the seers, and that endow-\nment is a function of a keen and pervasive spiritual life, peculiar\namong men, and carried out as part of the service of . . . the travel-\nling ministry of the Society of Friends to which, indeed, the\nSociety owed its origin in 1654. During the seventeenth century the\npreachers were revivalists, and later they, like the early Wesleyans,\nwere constantly travelling about the country. It is noteworthy\nthat among the early Wesleyans, as among the Friends, women had\nan equal share with men in the ministry ; but while the Friends\nhave always maintained this principle, it was abandoned by the\nWesleyans. There was also much travelling between England and\nAmerica, especially during the period 1770 to 1830, and the visiting\nministers, who depended chiefly on \" inner guidance \" as to where\nand when they went, were often away from their own homes for\nseveral years at a time. Their advice on all sorts of affairs, secular\nor religious, was sought and much valued.\nThere seems to have been \" a continuous sequence of religious\nexperience, beginning with the simple consciousness of fellowship\namong worshippers . . . going on . . . to the faculty on the human\nside of '\nspeaking to states '\n[i.e. giving messages especially appro-\npriate to the state of mind of individuals present] in family visiting or\nin meeting . . . then to comprehension of distant states of spirit,\nparticularly of dangerous and needy situations, and, on the Divine\nside, on to the visions of ineffable glory out of the body.\"\nGraham does not maintain that the stories are up to the standards\nof evidence of the S.P.R. But he says :\n\" They are generally taken\nfrom the journals of the Friend to whom they occurred, and I choose\nto believe them, being already convinced of the existence of the type\nto which they belong, and of the care and honesty of the narrators,\nwith whom meticulous caution in assertion was a kind of passion.\"\nWe find similar phenomena recorded in The Acts of the Apostles ; for\ninstance, telepathic cases\u2014to use the word \"telepathic \" in its widest\nsense\u2014in chaps, v. 3 ; ix. 10-16 ; x. 3-20 (a reciprocal case) ; and the\nprophecies of Agabus, chaps, xi. 28 ; xxi. 11. As Graham implies,\n\fJanuary 1!)34 Reviews 181\nthe evidence collected by the S.P.R. for the existence of the type\nmust make these reports more credible than they might otherwise\nbe. The same may be said of many incidents recorded of St Francis\nin the Fioretti and in the Speculum Perfectionis. He seemed to have\npossessed to an extraordinary degree the power of \" reading\n\"\npeople's minds, and many other religious leaders have shown signs\nof the same power,\u2014connected, perhaps, with the intense sympa-\nthetic interest that they, like St Francis, felt for individuals.\nOne of the most remarkable cases described by Graham is that of\nThomas Say, of Philadelphia, who, while in a state of coma, had\ntelepathic impressions afterwards verified. The case occurred in\nabout 1725 and the account written by the percipient was published\nin his Life, written by his son in 1796. The account, copied from this\nbook, was sent to us by Mr Graham in 1907, and was printed at length\nin the Journal, xiii. 87-90.\nI do not attempt here to summarise any of the cases, since they\nmust be read in detail to be appreciated ; but the booklet as a whole\ncan be strongly recommended to any one who is interested in the\nrelation between religion and psychical research.\nAlICE Johnson\nG.

Price 7s. 6d. net.\nMr Barnard in this book begins with science and, passing many\naspects of psychical research on the way, finally arrives at trans-\ncendental consciousness and Oriental mysticism. The book presents\nthe facts in a straightforward way and many of the well-known\ncases and the usual authorities are quoted.\nIn his opening chapter on \" Science and the Supernormal \" Mr\nBarnard gives a very fair definition of the word \" supernormal \",\nwhich he considers \" does not imply any more than that the pheno-\nmena in question are highly unusual, and take place under con-\nditions and through agencies of whose nature we are ignorant\n\"\n(pp. 15-16). On the other hand, he tells us on p. 15, after describing\nwhat he considers fraudproof methods of examining mediums, con-\ntrolling conditions and recording phenomena, that the \" evidence\nfor the analysis of water into Oxygen and Hydrogen is no stronger\nthan Schrenck-Notzing's evidence for the production of ectoplasm.\"\nThis remark is not only rather surprising to find in a \" Critical\nIntroduction to Psychic Science \", but throws some light on Mr-\nBarnard's notions of what are \" reliable authorities \". Moreover,\nare we to understand that the production of \" ectoplasm \" is not\nsupernormal ?

The type in question is that in which a group\nof sitters receive from professing communicators unknown to them\ndetails of facts, such as dates and names, which can afterwards be\nverified by reference to sources of information such as tombstones,\nobituaries, etc. The criticism is that inadequate care is not taken\nin the records of such cases to make it certain that the knowledge\nshown was not already in the mind or memory, conscious or un-\nconscious, of any member of the group, medium or sitters, before\nverification. Various facts revealed in the records make this ex-\nplanation plausible. Among others it appears that the supposed\n\fJanuary 1934 Notes on Periodicals 183\ncommunicator\u2014a stranger to the circle\u2014is not as a rule asked for\nor selected by any member of the experimenting group, but offers\nhimself through a member acting the part of medium.

These reports form as it\nwere the text for Dr Prince's paper, and he has added to its value by\ncomparing the New York series with others previously published\nelsewhere. This comparison reveals as I understand some interest-\ning points. But space forbids my going further into details here\nand I will only add that investigators desiring to study communi-\ncations of the type here spoken of would do well to study Dr Prince's\ncriticism with care.\nThe second half of Bulletin XXI is occupied by reviews of four\nimportant works on Spiritualism by Father Thurston, Mr Whately\nCarington, Professor Driesch and Mr George Lawton.]\nE.

During the year the Society has been able to carry\non a great deal of work of various kinds, of which an account will be\nfound below. This work would have been impossible, in the present\nfinancial situation, had it not been for the great generosity of our\nmembers ; the year is in fact notable for the number of donations\nwhich the Society has received towards research, towards the print-\ning expenses, and towards the General Fund. Notwithstanding\nthese donations the financial position of the Society, reflecting as it\ndoes the general economic depression, continues to give some cause\nfor anxiety. It is inevitable that the continued depression should\nresult in resignations, but we are glad to report these are fewer than\nfor several years. On the other hand, notwithstanding the depres-\nsion, there is an increase of applications for membership, a welcome\nsign of greater interest in the Society's work. Viewing the situation\nbroadly, the Council feel justified in taking a hopeful view of the\nSociety's future and in continuing an active policy of research of all\nkinds.\nResearch. For several years recently the Council has had occasion\nto regret the decline in the number of spontaneous cases reported,\nboth mental and physical. They are accordingly all the more glad\nto observe that during the latter part of the year there are signs of\nan increase, which they hope will continue. Visits have been paid\nby Mr Besterman and Miss Newton to several places in London and\nthe provinces from which reports have been received, and the\nCouncil wish to thank those members of the Society who have drawn\ntheir attention to cases worth investigation.\nThe past year has been an exceptionally busy one. Last year Mr\nBesterman took over the investigation of the Hacking case from\nMrs Sidgwick and Mr J. Arthur Hill, who had accumulated a con-\nsiderable amount of evidence in regard to it (see Journ. xxvi. 4).\nThis is the case in which communications have been obtained in Mr\nBarwelFs private circle at Sheffield, with no professional medium\npresent, purporting to come from Mr Hacking, a deceased school-\nmaster of Bury in Lancashire ; these communications contain a\nconsiderable amount of detailed information. In December 1932\nand January of this year Mr Besterman systematically examined and\narranged all the documents relating to the case, now numbering\nabout 400, including some of considerable length. He then entered\ninto communication with the persons chiefly concerned in the case,\nmade the personal acquaintance of several of them, and visited a\nnumber of the towns involved. As a result of these investigations\nhe came to certain tentative conclusions, dependent upon the obtain-\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcfi February 1934\ning of a particular piece of information. It is at present impossible\nto obtain this, and it is, therefore, still impossible to come to any\ndefinite conclusion about this case, which, nevertheless, remains one\nof the most unusual and interesting in the history of psychical\nresearch. The details, unfortunately, remain too private for a\nreport.\nIn connection with the same investigation it may be noted with\nsatisfaction that Mr Barwell has generously promised to bequeath\nto the Society all the original records of his circle, including those\nrelating to the Hacking case.\nDuring the course of the journey mentioned above, Mr Besterman\ninquired into two cases of haunted houses, one at Stafford and the\nother near Rugby. Later in the year he visited Leicester in con-\nnection with an unusual case of poltergeist type, in which water in\nconsiderable quantities appeared, it is alleged in a supernormal\nmanner, at various points in the house. In the first two cases no\nevidence of anything supernormal could be obtained. In the\nLeicester case inquiries are still proceeding.\nMembers will recollect in the last Annual Report an announcement\nthat arrangements had been made between the Society and the\nInstitut Metapsychique of Paris for collaboration in the further\ninvestigation of Rudi Schneider, as the Council felt that Dr Osty's\nmethods marked a welcome departure in the investigation of para-\nphysical phenomena. Mr Besterman, accompanied by Mrs Bester-\nman, accordingly went to Paris at the end of February to take part,\non behalf of the Society, in a new series of sittings with Rudi\nSchneider. Unfortunately the medium appeared to have temporarily\nlost his powers, and accordingly the series had to be cut short after\ntwo months. Rudi Schneider returned to Braunau, his native town,\nand was followed there by Mr Besterman, in the hope that super-\nnormal phenomena might be encouraged by the familiar atmosphere\nof the medium's home. This hope was realised to a slight extent,\nbut not sufficiently so to render advisable a return to Paris. Accord-\ningly Rudi Schneider was left to have a thorough rest, with a view\nto giving a series of sittings to the S.P.R. in the autumn. In\nSeptember a party of members of the Society, consisting of Miss\nReutiner, Lord Charles Hope, Mr John Evelyn, Captain Cochrane-\nBaillie, and Mr Besterman, went to Weyer, where the medium\nresides since his marriage to Fraulein Mitzi Mangl. The object of\nthis visit was to see whether the medium's powers had returned\nsufficiently to justify the projected visit to London. Several sittings\nwere held, and considerable and impressive phenomena, mainly of a\ntelekinetic kind, were witnessed. Rudi Schneider accordingly came\nto London, and has been giving sittings regularly in the Society's\nseance-room since the beginning of October. The sittings will con-\n\fFebruary 1934 Annual Report of the Council for 1988 189\ntinue for six months, and it is therefore too early to say anything\nconcerning them at the moment.\nThe collaboration with the Institut Metapsychique was a com-\nparatively costly matter for both bodies. It would consequently\nnave been impossible for the Society to continue the investigation\nbut for the generous financal help given by Lord Charles Hope and\nseveral of his friends, as well as a grant from the Myers Memorial\nFund. From the technical point of view, difficulties would have been\nexperienced but for the continuous and very able assistance given\nby Mr Oliver Gatty, who has also undertaken to find a considerable\nsum of money to permit of the continuation of the sittings into the\nNew Year. These facts again illustrate the extent to which the\nSociety is dependent on the assistance of its members for the proper\ncarrying out of its functions.\nWhile abroad, in connection with the investigation of Rudi Sch-\nneider, Mr Besterman was enabled, by the generosity of Mr Christo-\npher Wood, to proceed to Warsaw in company with Dr Osty, for\nthe purpose of having sittings with various mediums. From this\npoint of view the journey was unfruitful, the phenomena of the new\nmedium, with whom it had been hoped principally to experiment,\nnot proving satisfactory. Mr Besterman was able, however, to make\nthe personal acquaintance of a considerable number of Poles con-\ncerned in psychical research. The first fruit of this is the report on\nan experiment with M. Ossowiecki, published in Proceedings, xli.\n345-351.\nFurther gramophone records of Mrs Leonard's trance were made\nduring the year, with the kind co-operation of the Rev. C. Drayton\nThomas. One of these records, illustrating the communicating per-\nsonality of the \" Rev. John Thomas\", is available for purchase by\nmembers. At the same time as these records were made there was an\nattempt by Mr Gerald Heard and Mr Besterman to investigate the\ndirect voice alleged to occur in sittings with Mrs Leonard, by means\nof a method suggested by Dr Irons and Mr Soal and with the co-\noperation of the Gramophone Company's technical staff. This has\nbeen reported on in the Journal, xxviii. 84.\nLord Charles Hope has also kindly allowed a record made for him\nof the trance breathing of Rudi Schneider to be reproduced for sale\nto members.\nOwing to the various activities described above and to the con-\nsiderable amount of routine work, on some of which it is hoped to\nreport later on, Mr Besterman made comparatively little progress\nwith his investigation of records of Mrs Leonard's mediumship.\nNor has he yet been able to write his report on the experiment\nin the evaluation of free material obtained in trance medium-\nship.\n\fcs o o c OS = c m o 5 c OS CM 1-1 ITS c\ns _ CO to 00 o \u00b0 \u00ab5\n\u2014 OS 00 OS 00 3 \u2014 c rH CO X [ - rH 00 \u2014\n'\n\u2014 X C 5\n1\nOS\nrH\no o o to\n00 1\u20141\nOS\nCO\ncm X\nCO\nCO\n-t-\nN\nI\u2014i\nif5 cs\nfi t\nc CM\n1 - CO CO\nOS ifl\nrH\n1\n-\nCO\ns 5C 00 lO\nrH\n\u2014j\nC CO\nCM\nCM CO CM\nc\n00\nCO\nI - OS\nOS OS\n: i\nv. 3 C\n!\u00ab\u00ab\n<J \u00b0 CD\n5 -gi\n\" CD\nlo\n13\n\u00ab?\nSi\nft?\n^ r\/-'\nO\n.. da \"\nI\n\u2014\n1\n.5 x\nS !\nft. ,\nto\nS \u00a9\n42 ^\n1\no o\nO 00\nO CD\nO CO\nCO ^\n.\u00a7 \u00a7,.2\nS \"8 rS\ncq ft, \u00a3\n00.\nto \u00ab!\n&3\n\"jr.\n.Si i5\n*- 2?\n\u00a9 s\n\u00a3 |\n*~\nS3\nI\na\n^ \u00a9>\n' - & '\n1 a;\n53 Si ,\ns>\nC O O t\n\u2022> U >- ii\n\u20225\"- ft, ,\n\u2022\u00bb? \u00ab -s &\n14 \u00a71\nc a s; a; o tij fc, &5 \u00bbj a\nS 5\na *;\n5 \u00a7\n11\nS|\n\"<s>\n: 1\n:\ns ^ g s w\nr-( CM O O\nr- O O rH\nCI O\n00 if)\nrH\n00 O\nn c t c \"t\nCO O r-i L':\n\u00bb-o o o o\noo ir: i-h ci\nIII 1\n-\no cs 1\n- o 1 <\n0 CM ' o OS to iiii oo CM\no o CO = CO c 00 rs\no\nt+1\no\nl>\no LC5 CO\nCM\nCO CO CM o CM\nITS\nCM\nGO\nUO\nCl CO ^ CO CO\nC: Q Q O\nP.\nX\nK\nj= .s\n\u00a3 \u00a7 6\nS \u00a3 \u00b0\nX \u2014\nCO ^\nIs\ni\no\ns\n6-i ?\n2 g\ns\n\u2022S S s\nI\n^ ^ .2\nS S \u00a3Q Q\no ^\n\u00a7 3\ni ^\nj; .2\nCD 0) ^ \u2022\noo oo Ph\n3 '\u00ab\n-\nSot,\n\u00a9 HO\n<a g ts\nftj 5 tg o ft)\n\fa CO\n~ 00 C5 o\nto\ntH \u2014\nH\n<n 00 1^\nCO 1 ^\nCM CO\n00\n\u2014\n:~ CO\n<N\nB\n\"to'\n1'\n\u20222 S -2\n13\n\u00b0\ni 1\nIn? ,\nSi x\n-\u00ab s\n1\ne\nu p\ns o\nH\nO\no\n02\nla 5\nQj a Ct \u00a3\nO\no\n1\u2014\nt\nO r -H o\nH\nlO\n\u00a9 Cs\n; i\nTH\n\u00a3377\n00 01\nLO\n-\n0) Q\n'\n23 3\nCi \u00ab)\nrH <1>\na ri oi\nSI'S\nr-H o <0\nM < >.\n\"\u00a7 -B H\nS\u00a3 c \u00bb\nSI'S O i\n=5 \u00bb\n\u00a9 \u2014\n\u00ab P\n\u2022\n1\n1\n^ Q 3\nCo w\n1\n^ P CD\n\u20221 -i\n5^\n; s O\ni S\n6q cq co K?\nso o <o\nM O ifl\nf- o o\n01 O\n5*1\no\nOS\n-\n2\u00ab\n\fCO\nTO\n??\ni\u2014\ni\n\u00a7\nft?\na?\n\u2014\ni\ns.\nSi\n8\nft?\nfen\nSo\nC\nr\no\nA\np\n1-3\n<\n\u2014\nP?\nc\n-\no\nI\u2014\nI\nM\nW\nQ\nW\np?\no o = c\nc\nCO c \u2022*\no c\nCO to\n3\nO\nS a) \u00ab\n^ \u00a3, o\n\u2022S H -2\nCO CJ\n- _\n, CD\nT\u2014\nI\nCO &\n\u00ab .5\nS'a *s\n\u20228 &\na\nSi\nPCI\nin c 00 \u2014 o\no\no o I-H\nCO -t-\nlO \u00a9\nOS c\nSO C\nrH 00\ns 6;\n\u00a3 < <\n5 n\no o\n1\u00ab\u00ab\na?\nft?\nS\n>\nft?\ng\nEh\n><\ns;\nI\nto o\n04 O\no o\nttf CO\n.. 3\nco O\nCO\n2 O\n:\n\u00a7 \u00a7 g\nj\nco \u00a7\ns \u00ab \u00ab\n- S w\na ,\u00a7 >.\no . o\n'4 .\u00a7 n\nOS\nts>\ns\nSs\n| 3\n.S\na\nCO\nCO CO CO\nCO\nCO 0\nCM CO\nc+i c+i\n\" 3\nIN O\na\n-\n\fO\nSo\ng s\n1\u20141\nIO\nO 5?\n|\nl\u00a35 ,3\nO\n03\nJ3 C\nS *\n- \u00ab -g\nft\n^ - :3\na 5?\nop 2\nco n x:\nj u to i3\no o o -3 O\nCO \"g -W fe\n^\n3 \u00ab=\n? -c\ne3 03\nz\n_\n:\n2l|\nM H ft\n| | 5 |\n2 I a a \u00a7\n3 2 ^\nb o & fi\n\"\n5 o\n5 p w\n^ 3\n1\na a\no \u2014 o o c\no o o o o o o o o o\no X o o 00 -t o o\ns o o CR o \u2014 - \"O\n-\no r CM r -\n-< =*! =+1\n\u2022-i\no\nCO\nc\nS\u00b00\nia CO\no o\no o\nO O\nl\u00a3S ICS\n1^ CM\n\u2022 8 o\ny\u00a3 O c\nO CO\ns \u00ab \u00ab\n~ -S g\no - ^ o\n3 cj S O\n'lJ .3 ^\no o \u00a3 CO\n3 \u00ab S \u00a3\n1 * a? 1\n\u00a3>.>.\u00a3>,\n^ CS d V \u00b1>\nca -\nO H\ntea\no s.:\na\n2i\n-\nK\nS 1\n05 cc\n3 05 05\nO o\nS -a\n\u00ab 3 ft S\n5 I\n< z.\no ^\n2 P=\n5 5\n\u00ab 03 CO\n> 5 xf -a\n\"\nso d C2\n1\n^ S ce\nas \"O 13\n\"S 3 c\nQJ cS\na 3j a oi 05\nft 3\nO \"3\n_ \u00a3' x =\no _ c3 ^\n\u00a71^3\n^ \u00a9 >>'\u00a7\n\"\n7 i.'-\n~ 3 3 m\nCM CM CO 00\noj o c~ o\n!s o o\n3 = T3\n3 3 3\nCOO\nCO >-? h-1\nCO C7 O\nia o\n\u00bb oi\n5+1\no o\no o\no o\nO O O f~ CM\nO O O CO so\nX CM Ol OS LO\no o\nc o\no o\n** 01\nIO \u00bb-o\n4)\noo 3 co w\nO S \u00b0 \u00bb\n5 O g\na -3 ct\nP-l \u00ab -3\ng CO\n\u00b0 -o 73\n33 u\nO O b\nrj uo o\nCM C\nCI CO\n\f194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1934\nA series of experiments, which seem likely to prove of consider-\nable importance, has been initiated by Mr Whately Carington.\nThese consist in applying Word Association tests, including whenever\npossible observation of the psycho-galvanic reflex, to mediums (a)\nin their normal state and (b) under control. If mediumistic Controls\nand Communicators are really secondary personalities of the medium\nthen the responses to the tests in the two states might be expected\nto be substantially identical, while Mr Carington showed {Proc,\nxxxi. 401) as long ago as 1921, that tests of this kind are capable of\ndistinguishing normal individuals from each other. The results\nobtained should accordingly throw considerable light on the psy-\nchological status of the personalities concerned.\nA series of sittings has been held with Mrs Garrett and her Control\n\" Uvani\", and another series is in progress with Rudi Schneider and\n\" Olga\". In both these cases the data have been collected by Mr\nBesterman for analysis by Mr Carington.\nA third series of tests (with Mrs Leonard) has been rendered poss-\nible through the kind co-operation of Mr Drayton Thomas, who has\nnot only generously placed a number of his sittings at the disposal\nof the research, but is himself collecting the data, and has enlisted\nthe very valuable co-operation of two of the Communicators who\nhabitually control at his Sittings. In this case, therefore, no fewer\nthan four different personalities (counting Feda) of three different\ntypes are under observation, and it is hoped that results of great\ncomparative interest may be obtained.\nThe data obtained in these investigations are in process of a most\nlaborious analysis, but it is hoped that results will be available for\npublication in the course of the next two or three months.\nLibrary. The number of books, pamphlets, and volumes of peri-\nodicals in the library now stands at 7368, an increase of 92 during\nthe year. In addition to the volumes consulted in the library, 78\nmembers borrowed 479 volumes ; 55 volumes were borrowed by\nthe National Central Library. Several books were obtained for\nmembers through that library.\nMyers Memorial Lecture. As mentioned in the Annual Eeport for\n1932, the Council invited Dr Osty to deliver the Third Myers Memor-\nial Lecture in 1933, and were fortunate enough to receive his accept-\nance. Dr Osty visited England towards the end of October and\ndelivered his lecture, illustrated with lantern slides, and entitled\n\" Les Aspects supranormaux de l'energie et de la matiere\", on\n25 October. An English translation of the Lecture, which aroused\ngreat interest, has been printed and can be obtained from the\nSociety, price 2s. Many of our members were very glad to have\nthis opportunity of meeting Dr Osty, whose work has always been\nfollowed with close interest in England.\n\fFebruary 1931 Annual Report of the Council for 1933 195\nPresidency. The Council elected the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton,\nG.B.E., as President of the Society for the year, and she delivered\nher Presidential Address on 27 September. It has been published\nin Part 132 of Proceedings.\nChanges among the Officers and Council. Mr Fletcher having re-\nsigned his seat on the Council and also the office of Hon. Treasurer,\nMrs Lyttelton was appointed an elected member of Council in his\nplace, and Mr Salter became Acting Hon. Treasurer.\nIn view of the large amount of research work which the Society\nis doing abroad and with foreign mediums, in all of which Mr Bester-\nman has played an important part, the Council considered that it\nwould be desirable, without making any change in Mr Besterman's\nposition as Librarian and Editor, to give him also some title which\nshould recognise his connection with research. They accordingly,\nin September, appointed him Investigation Officer, and also ap-\npointed Lord Charles Hope and Mrs Salter as Consultant Investi-\ngators. The Council wish to re-affirm what they have said on\nprevious occasions, that they hope and expect that every member\nof the Society will engage actively in research so far as he or she\ncan, and that one of the main functions of the Officers of the\nSociety is to promote and co-ordinate research among non-official\nmembers.\nObituary. During the past year the Society has lost by death\nmany members who by long membership or active work have\nsupported the Society. These include Mrs Abernethy, Mrs W. W.\nBaggally, Mr A. R. Bonus, Lady Conway, Katharine Countess of\nCromer, Miss A. V. Dutton, Dr S. Ferenczi, Mrs C. B. Fernald, Mr\nC. H. Homan, Mr G. R. S. Mead, Mr E. T. Nisbet, the Rev. H.\nNorthcote and Mr 0. S. Tudor. The total number of deaths was\neleven Members, and eight Associates.\nMembership of the Society. During the year 49 new Members\nwere elected and one Associate became a Member. The total loss in\nnumbers from deaths, resignations and other causes was 45 Members\nand 21 Associates, leaving a net increase of four Members and a de-\ncrease of 21 Associates. The total membership of the Society now\nstands at 759.\nStudent Associates. While the Council are unable for financial\nreasons to rescind entirely the Resolution they passed several years\nago declining to elect new Associates, they have thought it desirable,\nin order to stimulate interest in the Society's work among the\nyounger generation, particularly students at Universities, to relax\nthis rule so as to entertain applications for election as Associates\nfrom persons not less than 18 years of age, who shall undertake on\nattaining 25 either to become full Members or to resign.

Stefan Ossowiecki,\" by Mr\nTheodore Besterman.\n\fFebruary 1934 Correspondence 197\nCORRESPONDENCE\nSpeculations about Telepathy.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I have rarely seen in the Society's publications as able,\nlucid and illuminating an utterance as that by Mr W. Whately\nCarington entitled \" Implications of Telepathy \" (Journal, xxviii.\n57-64). It seems to me to clarify thought on the whole subject.\nIt is an excellent example of the advantage of applying methods of\ncommon-sense and logical reasoning to vague and loose current\nideas.\nNevertheless, with entire humility, and claiming, as will, I fear,\nbe but too apparent, no special knowledge, I venture to offer a few\ncomments upon Mr Carington's observations. Among the pro-\npositions which Mr Carington describes as \" erroneous \", he cites\nfirst that \" Telepathy is an accepted fact of Science \". Now if\nhe means no more than that telepathy has not yet attained the\nstatus of being accepted as a fact by the whole body of science, like\ngravity, or the revolution of the Earth on its axis, I suppose this\nremark is true enough. But if telepathy is not in that full sense\nan accepted fact of \" science \", I suggest that it is, notwithstanding,\na familiar fact of daily existence about which many scientists have\nnot, and none need have, any doubt as a fact, as a phenomenon,\nhowever doubtful they be as to its real nature, as to the laws of its\noperation, and as to the suitability of the name by which it is at\npresent known. Erom personal everyday experience, I myself\nhave no doubt of it at all. I have seen it in obvious operation on\nmore occasions than I could remember or count. I once made a\nfriend sitting opposite me in a railway carriage commence whistling\ntwo tunes, one after another, by merely thinking about them with\nthat object. I once\u2014I am headmaster of a school\u2014demonstrated\nto a member of my staff, from three or four human subjects taken at\nrandom on the spot, how easy it is mentally to influence the mind\nof a child to give or not to give a certain answer in certain circum-\nstances. I use this knowledge daily, as a commonplace, as I use\nblackboard chalk. Animals provide plenty of instances of tele-\npathy. I have had at least one clear instance of a thought of mine\nbeing mentally read and verbally answered by the control of a\nmedium. (And yet, repeated attempts to influence a medium by\nthought have invariably produced no apparent result !\n)\nMyers, on page 207 of Human Personality (abridged edition),\nsays, \" It has now . . . been actually proved that the hypnotic\ntrance can be induced from a distance so great, and with precautions\nso complete, that Telepathy, or some similar supernormal influence\nis the only efficient cause which can be conceived.\"' On page 539\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1934\nhe says, \" The subject's power of response to a question \" (by a\nperson not the hypnotist) \" was shown to be under the control of\nthe unspoken will of the hypnotist.\" In Dr Milne Bramwell's\nwork on hypnotism, experiments are described in which a patient\nin one room answered questions mentally put to him by the operator\nin another room, and another in which the operator, sitting in his\nown house, willed his subject, sitting in another house, to rise, leave\nhis house, and come to that of the operator, competent witnesses\nhaving been pre-arranged in both houses. So much for \" science \" !\nIt seems to be a case of \" Sae much the warse for the coo !\n\"\nThe third disputed proposition is that \" Telepathy is in some way\nlike, or akin to, '\nWireless ' \". Well, is the \" akin-to-wireless\n\"\nhypothesis quite as absurd as it appears to be after Mr Carington\nhas destructively dealt with it ?\nMr Carington says that \"... as a matter of plain anatomical\nfact, there exists no bodily organ, whether a part of the nervous\nsystem or not, of which the striicture even remotely suggests that\nit could in any circumstances act as a generator of electro-magnetic\nradiation having the intensity and penetrative power required.\"\nWhy intensity ? What is to be penetrated ? We do not know.\nBesides\u2014structure . . . perhaps not ; but how about functions ?\nI was informed recently by a medical man that it has now been\ndefinitely proved that nerve currents are electrical in their nature.\nAnd very natural too, for it seems as if few things in Nature are\nanything else. It would therefore seem that a muscular contraction\nis due to chemico-electric energy generated in the muscular tissues\nwhich is evoked or induced by an electrical nerve current generated\nby the brain or the spinal cord.\nIf I understand the general process of wireless aright, it is this :\nthat certain waves (admittedly at their source very powerful) are\ndistributed by the broadcasting aerials ; these radiate concentrically\nand doubtless in accordance with the Law of Inverse Squares to\nwhich Mr Carington alludes. But there is no limit to the distance\nof their radiation. There is no one point at which they cease.\nThey presumably reach Mars, or Pluto, or, for that matter, the stars\nof Orion, unless intercepted or deflected, as really, however attenu-\nated and faint, as they do Brighton or Capetown or Yokohama.\nTheir capability of being \" picked up \" is limited only by the\nlimitations of sensitiveness of any instruments designed to receive\nthem. But\u2014this is an important point\u2014the loud speaker is not\ncaused to vibrate by these picked-up waves from the Ether, which\nare themselves far too weak to do such work, but by variations or\noscillations induced by these faint waves in the much more powerful\ncurrent supplied locally to the set by the battery or the domestic\nsource of electric supply.\n\fFebruary 1934 Correspondence 199\nNow if the brain can generate nerve-currents which, in their\nturn, evoke such a formidable quantity of energy as that involved\nin raising a sack of wheat on the shoulders, is it so absurd to suppose\nthat it may be capable of producing induced intensifications, not\nnecessarily at all powerful, of currents, waves, vibrations, call\nthem what you will, which have first been picked up by some more\nrefined and delicate sensitiveness in some more obscure stratum\nof our personality 1 Is it quite absurd to postulate that thought-\nimpulses are . . . shall I coin a word, to be on the safe side, and\nsay electroform ?\nMr Carington uses a rather powerful argument when he says,\n<;\nThe essential feature of every normal method of communication\nwhatsoever is the use of signs, signals or symbols ... in accordance\nwith an explicitly or implicitly recognised code.\" He goes on to\nsay that the radiation theory, or any physical theory, requires\nsome process of encoding and decoding automatically, uncon-\nsciously, and with respect to an unknown code, and this he calls\n\" fantastic to the point of incredibility \". But it is exactly these\nthings which we, so entirely ignorant as we are of all strata of the\npersonality outside the physically conscious, are not entitled to assert.\nMoreover, I suggest that we only really need signs and symbols\nwhen we require to communicate by word of mouth, by writing,\nby signalling, or by other physical means, with beings whose\nconscious reception of our ideas is limited to similar means. We\nthink, chiefly though not wholly, in unspoken words : but is not\nthis because we are so used to expressing our thoughts aloud in\nwords or to writing them ? Would Mr Carington suggest that an\nuntaught deaf-and-dumb person does not think because he has\nlearnt no sounds or symbols ? But if he does think, how does he\ndo it ? AVithout such sounds and symbols, of course.\nIf we believe in the existence of any non-material aspect or phase\nor stratum of personality, and I think Mr Carington does, we must\npostulate thought without signs, symbols and codes, without\ntongues, ears, or fingers\u2014thought which is just as real as if it were\nspoken, thought which, in a non-material state of existence, not\nonly can be but must be communicable and understandable without\nthese physical aids, or perhaps I should say obstacles.\nFinally, it has often been asked, why the mind of A should be\ncapable of receiving telepathic impressions and not that of B ?\nWhy can X receive them from Y and not from Z ? Again the\n\" wireless \" analogy seems to hint an explanation. Is not the\ntruth quite possibly that while A, B, and X all receive them equally,\nA's instrument is more capable than B's of reproducing them in\nthe conscious part of his brain, and that X can do this better in\nthe case of impulses received from Y than he can in the case of\n\f200 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Fbbruart 1934\nthose received from Z ? Transmitters, or Agents, may vary in their\npowers of transmission, just as receivers, or Percipients may vary,\nnot in their powers of reception but in those of intensification and\nof transfer to the Conscious.\nYours, etc.,\nAlan Howgrave-Graham.\nOn the Possibility of Proving Survival.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014May I make a brief comment on Mr Saltmarsh's suggestion\nthat the absence of gradual improvement is \"a point against\n\"\nspirit communications ? This might be so if it was a universal\nexperience, which it is not. That my later proxy sittings for the\nsame person produced less evidential matter than the first and\nsecond may be due to the fact that the medium's mind was no longer\na tabula rasa. In the particular case I have in mind at first both the\nmedium and I were totally ignorant of the person whose communica-\ntion was desired and almost equally ignorant of the recipient\u2014a lady\nin Canada I had never met. After success had been obtained there\nwas more scope for inferences, which experience shows are liable to\nbe made by the medium or the sitter. These inferences are unin-\ntentionally misleading, they are frequently erroneous and thus con-\nfuse the issue. If the passivity of the medium is disturbed by her\nown marginal thoughts the communicator finds obstruction in his\nway.\nYours, etc.,\nHelen Alex. Dallas.\n\fNo. 503.\u2014Vol. XXVIII.

The President in the Chair.\nThe following Members were present : Mrs Ball, Mr Theodore\nBesterman, Mrs Theodore Besterman, Miss Carruthers, Mrs Goldnev\nMiss G. Hvnes, Miss S. Boucher James, Dr Eva Morton, Miss I.\nNewton, Mr W. S. Rowntree, Mr W. H. Salter, Mrs W. H. Salter,\nAdmiral the Hon. A. C. Strutt. Rev. C. Drayton Thomas. Mr G. N.\nTyrrell, and Miss Nea Walker.\nThe Secretary having read the notice convening the Meeting, the\nPresident invited discussion on the Report of the Council, which,\nwith the audited statement of Accounts, had already been cir-\nculated to members. There being no response, Mr W. H. Salter,\nActing Hon. Treasurer, made his financial statement.\nIn presenting the accounts for the year, Mr Salter drew attention\nto two passages in the Annual Report, (1) the paragraph showing\nthat for the first time for several years the new Members elected\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Makch ui34\nexceeded the loss of Members by resignation and death, and (2) the\nreference to the donations received by the Society during 1938 for\nprinting, for apparatus, for research, and for general purposes.\nSince the Report had been printed the Society had received from\na member who wished to remain anonymous an extremely generous\ndonation of \u00a31,000, to be applied for particular objects of research,\nincluding both parapsychical and paraphysical phenomena. With\nthis donation the Society could confidently continue an active policy\nof research. Mr Salter reminded Members that the Society's lease\nexpired in 1937, so that it might then be necessary to make a general\nappeal to meet the expenses that would arise. If that should be\nnecessary, he hoped that Members would bear in mind the generosity\nwith which the needs of research had been met, and respond to the\nappeal in the same spirit of liberality.\nThe Chairman announced that there were no candidates for\nelection to membership of the Council other than the six members\nwho retired by rotation. The following six members were re-elected\naccordingly : Mr. G. W. Lambert, Dr T. W. Mitchell, Mr W. H.\nSalter, Mrs W. H. Salter, Mr Sydney C. Scott, and Mrs Henry\nSidgwick.\nMessrs Hartleys, Wilkins, Avery and Flew were re-elected\nAuditors for the forthcoming year.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nPrecognition and Psychoanalysis\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir. \u2014Reading Mr Saltmarsh 's interesting and able \" Report on\nCases of Apparent Precognition,\" I was led to wonder, not for the\nfirst time, why the psychical researcher and the psychoanalyst pay\nso little heed to each other's work. Mr Saltmarsh does mention\nFreud at least twice. But in more than one respect he fails, as it\nseems to me, to appreciate the bearing of Freud's findings upon the\nevidence under discussion.\nArguing against the view that apparent precognitions are due to\ncoincidence, Mr Saltmarsh states (p. 69) that \" the number of\nsubjects which may be dreamed about is practically infinite \", and\ndraws the inference that \" the chances that any particular subject\nwill enter into the dream on any particular night are very small.\"\nThe statement is true ; the inference, for anyone who accepts the\nmain results of Freud's work, is as a universal assertion false. The\ndream is not a card drawn at random from a practically infinite pack.\n\fMarch 1934 Correspondence 205\nIt is a symbolic drama, determined as to its latent content by a\nfundamental emotional situation. The number of such fundamental\nsituations is, as every habitual novel reader knows, severely limited ;\nand analysis has shown that thousands of dreamers use the same\nsymbols to express essentially similar situations. Failure to allow\nfor this may be a serious source of error in estimating the evidential\nforce of particular dreams which are claimed as supernormal. Thus\nin discussing Mrs C's dream about the monkey (P. xi. 488), Mr Salt-\nmarsh observes that \" dreams of being followed by a monkey are\nsurely very rare, at any rate for persons living in this country.\"\nI have no statistics on the question ; but I nevertheless venture to\ncontradict Mr Saltmarsh flatly. Analysis shows that dreams sym-\nbolising sexual assault are exceedingly common in women ;\npursuit\nby an animal is among the symbols most often employed in such\ndreams ; and a monkey is for obvious reasons a peculiarly appro-\npriate animal to choose. My own guess would be that on the night\nof Mrs C's dream at least a hundred women in London dreamed of\nbeing chased by monkeys. If this were accepted, the coincidence\ninvolved would be reduced to the fact that the real monkey, finding\nhimself at liberty, followed one of these hundred or more women.\nThis, though still rather remarkable, would be far less so than many\nevents which are known to have been produced by pure chance\u2014e.g.\nthe case, recorded in the press a year or two ago, of a man who\nbought at random one ticket in each of three successive \" Irish\nsweeps and with each ticket won a prize. (It is irrelevant to the\nabove argument whether we assume that Mrs C's dream was in fact\ndetermined by the \" sexual assault \" motif. It may not have been,\nthough the excessive fear by which it was accompanied strongly\nsuggests that it was.)\nSimilar criticism might be applied to some of the other cases\nquoted by Mr Saltmarsh. And the evidential value of one whole\nclass of dreams\u2014viz., those which appear to exhibit supernormal\nknowledge of the contemporary or future death of a friend or relative\n\u2014seems to be in some measure weakened by the fact that dreams\ndirectly expressive of a \" repressed death-wish \" towards beloved\npersons are now recognised to be relatively common. This fact may\nalso serve to explain, at least in part, the strikingly high percentage\nof death-coincidences among the total number of cases adduced as\nevidence of precognition. If I dream, or day-dream, more often of\nX's death than of, let us say, his appointment to a professorial chair.\nI have on the coincidence theory a better chance of \" precognising\n\"\nthe former event ; while on the precognition theory the information\nsupernormally acquired by my subconsciousness has probably a\nbetter chance of reaching my conscious self if it happens to fulfil a\nsubconscious wish. In saying this I do not overlook Mr Saltmarsh's\n\f20G Journal of Society for Psychical Research March i\u00abJ34\nobservation that the proportion of death-precognitions to other\nprecognitions is significantly higher in hallucination cases than it is\neven in dreams. This fact is, I think, quite simply grounded in the\nnature of hallucinations as such. Hallucinations ot inanimate ob-\njects, of complex events or of complex situations are comparatively\nrare : most hallucinations take the form of a phantasmal figure or a\nphantasmal voice. If the figure or voice is identified as that of a\nperson X, and X dies within a short time, this is claimed as a pre-\ncognition. If some other event happens to X. such as marrying or\nobtaining an appointment, no precognition will as a rule be claimed\nexcept (a) in the rare case of the hallucination including an explicit\nreference to the event, (6) in certain \" arrival \" cases. Hence we\nshould expect in hallucinations the exceptionally high proportion\nof death precognitions which Mr Saltmarsh finds. We should also\nexpect an exceptionally high proportion of \" arrival \" cases ; and\nthis too we find (14-5 % in hallucinations, against 4-4% in other\nmodes of apprehension, according to the table on p. 55).\nLastly, Mr Saltmarsh expresses surprise that the amount of sym-\nbolism in his precognitive cases is not greater (p. 58). But one may\nsuspect that in such cases the event precognised has itself within the\ndream or phantasy the function of a symbol. In normal dreams the\n\" latent content \" which is expressed symbolically is connected with\nthe personal situation of the dreamer ; and Freud 1\nfinds that this\nis equally true of telepathic dreams, telepathy determining not the\nlatent content but the choice of a symbol to express it. Similarly\nin precognitive dreams, if precognition be a reality, I should expect\nthe manifest content of the dream to bear a symbolic relation to the\ndreamer's personal situation, and a direct relation to the event pre-\ncognised. Mr Saltmarsh would thus be looking for symbolism in the\nwrong place.\nYours, etc..\nE. R. Dodds.\n1\nNew Introductory Lectures on Psycho- Analysis, p. 53.\n\fMarch 193} Reviews 207\nREVIEWS\nNandor Fodor, Encyclopaedia of Psychic Science. Preface by Sir\nOliver Lodge. 4to, pp. lv. 416. London : Arthurs Press,\nLimited [1934].\nDr Fodor is to be congratulated on having produced a work of\nreference which must have cost an immense amount of patient\nlabour, and is likely for many years to come to be of great assistance\nto students of psychical research, especially to those who use the\nwork primarily as a means of increasing their information by con-\nsulting the original sources.\nThe articles may be roughly classified under two headings, one,\nhistorical, including biographies of psychical researchers and\nmediums, and also accounts of the different Societies and publica-\ntions which deal or have dealt with psychical research and spiritual-\nism, and, two, theoretical. In his Preface Sir Oliver Lodge says\n\" though his [Dr Fodor's] scepticism does not come quite up to\nS.P.R. standard, it may be said that he has not excluded hostile\nopinion, and on the whole has surveyed the whole subject with\nfairness and ability.\" After reading fairly widely in the Encyclo-\npaedia we are prepared to endorse this cautious judgment with\ncertain reservations. It would be impossible to write biogmphies of\nmediums that every student of psychical research and spiritualism\nwould accept as impartial ; it is no mean feat on Dr Fodor's part\nto have produced several biographies that would meet with general\nacceptance, but occasionally in dealing with particular mediums he\nerrs on the side of leniency in just the same way as in dealing with\nsome of the critics of physical phenomena, and especially critics\nbelonging to our Society, he seems to suffer from a hostile bias.\nAs examples of undue leniency we may mention the articles on\nMrs Crandon, Eva O, and the late William Hope. Mrs Crandon has\na long article in which adequate mention is made of Mr Dudley's\ndiscovery of the Kerwin \" thumbprints \", but mention should in\nthis connexion also have been made of the print of the medium's\nown thumb made on a piece of wax in the Society's seance-room\nwhile she was supposed to be so controlled as to be out of reach of\nthe wax : see Proceedings, xxxix. 358-368. Nor should Dr Fodor\ntalk of the Margery \" cross-correspondences \" as \" less vulnerable \",\ni.e., than the thumbprints, owing to their \" fraud-proof technique\n\",'\nwithout referring to the demonstration in Proceedings, xxxviii.\n399-408, that the alleged\n' ;\nfraud-proofness \" was illusory.\nUnder Eva O, Dr Fodor's treatment of the charges of fraud during\nher Algerian period is unsatisfactory ;\nthey were much more serious\nthan could possibly be gathered from Dr Richet's reference which is\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1934\nall that Dr Fodor quotes : see Proceedings, xxvii. 333-369. In this\ninstance, and in several others, the reader may justly complain that\nhe has not been brought into direct touch with the original and\nauthoritative sources. Mention should also be made of the photo-\ngraphs discovered among Dr Geley's papers at the Paris Institut\nafter his death. Although these have never been published their\nexistence, and their significance, are matters of common knowledge.\nWilliam Hope also gets off far too easily. Dr Fodor admits that\nthe 1922 exposure was \" on the surface damning for Hope \". (Inci-\ndentally this exposure was printed in the Joumal for that year and\nnot in Proceedings, as stated by Dr Fodor.) In order, however, to\nremove this slur on Hope, Dr Fodor endorses one of the misstate-\nments made at the time by Hope's defenders, namely, that the\npacket containing the plates \" was lying about for four weeks in the\noffices of the S.P.R.\" The author could easily have ascertained the\nuntruth of this statement if he had enquired, as he should have done,\nof the Society's officials. Nor is it fair to speak of Major Rose's and\nMr Barlow's case against Hope {Proceedings, xli.) as \" largely built\non surmise and suspicion and not on facts \", as any of our readers\ncan judge for themselves by reading the paper in question.\nThe biographies of psychical researchers are mostly shorter and\nshould prove useful. If some important researchers receive little or\nno biographical notice, that is perhaps due to their own modesty\nrather than to any fault of Dr Fodor's.\nTurning to the accounts of Societies, we naturally look first to see\nwhat the author has to say of the S.P.R. The first few paragraphs\nare favourable to the Society's work, but are followed by four para-\ngraphs of intemperate hostility, in which quotations from Sir Oliver\nLodge and Mr E. T. Bennett are torn from their contexts to bolster\nup an attack on the Society's work with regard to physical pheno-\nmena. So far from the Society having any reason to be apologetic,\nas the author would suggest, with regard to its record in this branch\nof our subject, we may reasonably claim that the Society was the\npioneer in investigating the causes of errors of observation, and, on\nthe basis of the knowledge so acquired, in setting up and maintaining\na standard of technique, departure from which renders valueless\nresults, however sensational, obtained by investigators however\neminent or well advertised.\nDr Fodor's failure to obtain authentic statements from the\nofficers of our Society has also lead him into a stupid gaffe about the\nresult of Conan Doyle's attack on the Society at the time of his\nresignation. Dr Fodor suggests that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's\nattack was successful to the extent of inducing 84 members of the\nSociety to resign. The facts are stated in the Council's Annual\nReport for 1930 {Journal, xxvii. 24) :\n\" The Council are glad to say\n\fMahoi I 1934 Reviews 209\nthat this attack on the Society failed almost completely, only six\nMembers and one Associate, none of whom had ever taken an active\npart in the Society's work, resigning on the grounds of agreement\nwith this [Sir A. Conan Doyle's] circular \".\nWe should not, however, wish it to be supposed that the whole of\nthe historical matter is infected with the faults indicated above, and\nthere are numerous articles on the theoretical side of psychical\nresearch in which different representative points of view are stated.\nW. H. S.\nProblemy Metapsychologie. Les ProbUmes de la Metapsychique.\nResultats de Venquete internationale du \" Pestry Tyden \" d\nPrague. 8vo, pp. 110, 9 portraits. Prague 1933.\nThis volume, which is dedicated to the memory of Sir William\nCrookers on the occasion of his centenary in June 1932, is the result\nof an enquiry undertaken by the Prague weekly paper, Pestry\nTyden, as to the state of psychical research in the different countries\nof Europe. The paper addressed to leading psychical researchers\nand spiritualists in most of the European countries the following\nfive questions :\n1. What is the attitude nowadays of the general public in your\ncountry towards the problems of psychical research ?\n2. Why does official science up to the present time for the most\npart display hostility towards these problems ?\n3. Are the results obtained by psychical research up to the present\ntime of a kind to influence our views on the spiritual nature of man ?\n4. Do you attach more importance to \" subjective \" psychical\nresearch, which deals with parapsychical phenomena, or to objective\npsychical research which deals with paraphysical phenomena ?\n5. On the basis of the knowledge obtained to date is it possible\nto prove scientifically the personal survival of man after bodily\ndeath \\\nThirty-four persons in about a dozen countries replied to this\nquestionnaire at more or less length, and the contributors would\nappear to be ou the whole a group fairly representative of opinion\namong psychical researchers in Europe, although one notes with\nregret the absence of several important names. The answers are\nprinted in English, French, German or Czech, according to the\nnationality of the contributor, the Czech contributions being also\ntranslated into French, and the English, French, and German con-\ntributions into Czech. The enquiry was under the personal direction\nof Dr Karel Kuchynka, the Editor of the psychical section of Pestry\nTyden, and a member of the Committee of Moral Hygiene at the\n\f210 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1934\nMinistry of Public Health in Prague ; Dr Kuchynka is to be con-\ngratulated on having presented his readers with a book of very great\ninterest.\nIt is impossible to summarise the opinions of all the contributors\nin a short notice. English readers may perhaps be surprised to find\nthat many of our Continental confreres (though by no means all)\ndraw a sharp distinction between what they call \" the English\nschool \" of psychical research, based mainly on the study of spon-\ntaneous psychical phenomena and tending, it is suggested, to a\nspiritualist conclusion, and a \" Erench school \" pursuing the experi-\nmental study of physical phenomena and reaching thereby animistic\nconclusions. I do not think that any of our leading members, or for\nthat matter Dr Richet or Dr Osty in Erance, would quite accept that\nview of the position.\nOn the question of survival a few of the contributors, like Sir\nOliver Lodge, say definitely '\nyes ', and a few others definitely '\nno '.\nThere seems however to be a general tendency, if one may say so\nwithout disrespect, to \" hedge \" on this question, and a very common\nview seems to be that there is some sort of evidence, if not amounting\nto scientific certainty, for the survival of what M. Ch. Quartier calls\na \" quid \", which may or may not be of a personal nature.\nIt is to be hoped that many of our members will read this book.\nI do not know of any other which gives so full and handy an account\nof the state of opinion among leading psychical researchers on the\nmain questions which arise in our work.\nW. H. S.\nThe Complete Works of H. P. Blavatsky. Edited by A. Trevor\nBarker. Vol. i (1874-1879) ; vol. ii (1879-1881). London :\nRider and Co., 1933. 15s. net each.\nThe edition of Mme Blavatsky's complete writings, of which these\nare the two first volumes, will doubtless give much pleasure to her\nTheosophical disciples all over the world, but it is doubtful if they\nwill increase her reputation among other readers. They reveal too\nmuch. The first letters in the first volume, for example, demonstrate\nher enthusiasm as a Spiritualist in her first years in America : she\ndescribes herself as \" a Spiritualist of many years' standing \" and\nannounces that \" for the sake of Spiritualism I have left my home,\nan easy life among a civilized society, and have become a wanderer\nupon the face of the earth.\" Later on Mr Barker will doubtless print\nher denials that she was or had been a Spiritualist ; even in these\ntwo volumes she is shown gradually attempting to establish herself\nas a hostile critic of the creed for which she claimed (when it suited\n\fMarch 1934 Reviews 211\nher) to have abandoned luxury and ease. Mr Barker and his assis-\ntants do not seem to have unearthed any new materials of value.\nAmong matter familiar to students one notes with amusement the\ntwo letters to the editor of the New York World, written in 1877, in\nwhich Mme Blavatsky showed an uncritical loyalty to her native\ncountry (e.g. \" The Sublime Porte has had the sublime effrontery to\nask the American people to execrate Russian barbarity,\" and\n\" during the emeute in Odessa, which was caused by some Jewish\nchildren throwing dirt into the church on Easter night, and which\nlasted more than a week, the Russian soldiers shot and bayonetted\ntwelve Christian Russians and not a single Jew \") and some spirited\ninvective directed at anybody who had the audacity to disagree with\nthe writer, no matter on what topic and with what authority. On\nthe whole, however, these pages are dull reading : Mme Blavatsky\nis more interesting as a psychological study than as a collected\nwriter.\nC. E. Bechhofer Roberts.\nProfessor Charles Richet, La Grande Esperance. 8vo, pp. 293.\nParis : Editions Montaigne, 1933.\nProfessor Richet's book, written with his usual charm and lucidity\nof style, opens with some general philosophical considerations of\nwhich a cardinal point is found in his conclusion that the whole\nprocess of terrestrial evolution has been directed towards intellectual\ndevelopment. In considering where this development\u2014which is still\nin its infancy\u2014may lead us, Professor Richet finds \" the great hope\n\"\nof the future in metapsychical science. Great as the achievements\nof \" classical science \" have been and are likely to be. he sees no\nreason to expect that they will profoundly influence our mental and\nmoral attitude towards life. But in those wide unknown fields of\nwhose existence psychical phenomena give us evidence Professor\nRichet believes that the human intellect of the future will find its\ngreat adventure.\nHe passes briefly in review various types of psychical phenomena,\nand readers of his earlier books will not need to be told that he\naccepts as established cryptaesthesia (including telepathy), ecto-\nplasmic phenomena and telekinesis. It is of interest to note that\nalthough the spiritistic hypothesis, especially in its cruder forms, is\nstill unacceptable to Professor Richet, he does not find it possible\nto reject it unconditionally :\n\" it is legitimate to say that in certain\ncases the spiritistic explanation is the least open to objection \".\nH. de G.

Williams, Willcott, Wood-\nwarde Road, Dulwich (also a Cornish Quaker), sent to that journal an\naccount of a dream of his own. This was published in The Wayfarer\nfor February 1934 (xiii. 4) x, and is reproduced below as it was\noriginally written by Mr Williams :\n\" On reading recently in ' The Wayfarer' an article under the above\nheading I was reminded that I ought to also place on record the\nfollowing facts.\n\" Although of comparatively minor importance the underlying\nprinciple of premonition in a dream is clearly evidence but appar-\nently inexplicable.\n\" On the morning of the '\nDerby Day', 31st May last, having been\nfor some time not in the best of health (an octogenarian) I was re-\nquested at 8.15 to remain in bed for a few minutes whilst my break-\nfast was being prepared, as the dining-room was being rearranged.\n\" I am an ardent opponent of betting and gambling, was not\nthinking of the 'Derby', am not interested in racing and did not\nknow the names of any horses in the race which was to be run at\nabout 2 p.m.\n\"I fell asleep at 8.20, and at 8.35 was aroused from a dream in\nwhich I heard a detailed account of the race as by radio and the\nnames of the first four winners\u2014Hyperion, King Salmon and two\nothers which I failed to remember (not being acquainted with the\nnames) and was suddenly '\ncut off' by the knock at my door with\nbreakfast.\n\" I had dreamt of listening in on 'phones from a rather ancient\ncrystal receiver and hearing the whole of the race from the start to\n'around Tattenham Corner', and, in excited tones, how Hyperion\ngained the lead and won, when I was disturbed.\n\" I knew the Crystal set was out of order, but was so impressed\nwith the seeming reality of the account that I resolved to put the\nset right and listen at 2 p.m. This I did and when the race was pro-\nceeding heard the identical expressions and names as in the dream !\n\" Can this be explained ?\n\" In confirmation of the above to remove any natural doubt by\nreaders of this, it may be well to mention that the same morning, at\n11 o'clock, having to make a short journey by 'bus I met a neighbour\nin it to whom I related my morning's experience and asked him to\nnote the result of the race. I also told it to another person in\nPeckham to whom I went on business matters at 11.20 a.m.\n\fApril 1934 Case 217\n\" The neighbour referred to was also heard to relate in a restaurant\nlong before the race, what I had told him at 11 a.m.\n\" The two persons to whom I spoke in the morning hereby certify\nto the fact by their signatures, viz. :\n(Signed) C. A. Young, 71 Court Lane, Dulwich\nRetired Civil Servant\nW. E. Roland Doughty, 7 Camomile Street,\nE.G. 3. Certified Accountant\nJohn H. Williams, (Also a Cornish Quaker).\n30th November 1933.\"\nMr Saltmarsh wrote to the two witnesses, and Mr. Doughty replied\nas follows (2 March 1934) :\n\" With great pleasure, I accede to your request for permission to\npublish my signature certifying that Mr John H. Williams related\nthe story of his dream to me.\n\" On the morning of Derby Day I was working at the address of a\nclient in Rye Lane, Peckham, when an elderly gentleman called and\nagreed to wait for the return of my client who had just gone out. He\nsat down in the office with me and we chatted together when the\nsubject of betting came under discussion and the credulity of those\nwho bet in signs and omens. In the course of conversation Mr\nWilliams told me that he had had a dream to which backers of horses\nwould attach much significance.\n\" Mr Williams stated that his daughter had requested him to\nremain in bed a little longer that morning because she wished to\nclean up the dining room. During the interval of my first awakening\nand getting up. I fell asleep again, said Mr Williams, and dreamt that\nI was listening in to a wireless account of the Derby : the progress\nof the race was described by the Announcer, and at last I heard him\nsay 'Hyperion has won'.\"\n\" My client returned during the morning, and when Mr Williams\nhad gone, I repeated to him the story Mr Williams had told to me,\nand ascertained the name and profession of his caller.\"\nMr Young replied as follows (3 March 1934) :\n\" I am quite willing that you should publish my name as verifying\nthe narrative of Mr William's dream.\n\"The main facts are incontestable. On the morning of last\n'Derby Day' I boarded a 'bus for about 15 minutes run and Mr\nWilliams whom I knew as a casual acquaintance got on the same\nbus. We settled down to a chat. The time being about 11.30 or a\nlittle earlier.\n\"Mr Williams then related to me the incident he has described.\nO 2\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1934\nAs I have the elderly man's failing of not being quite certain of re-\nmembering all the remarks that passed I will give what I am certain of.\n\" After commenting on the usual topic\u2014the weather\u2014Mr Williams\nsaid I had a curious thing happen to me this morning. My daughter\nwas busy with household duties and suggested that I should stay in\nlied until after I had had my breakfast so as to be out of the way.\n\" I had my breakfast and then snuggled down and dropped off and\nI heard quite clearly the result of the Derby come through on the\nwireless and the shouts of ' Hyperion first ' or ' Hyperion wins ' (I can-\nnot be certain which and I don't remember whether he told me he\nalso heard the other placed horses).\n\" As Mr Williams is the last person in the world to suggest an\ninterest in racing I observed to him that he must have uncon-\nsciously read the names of the Derby horses in the morning paper\nbut he assured me that he had not then seen the daily paper.\n\" I was so impressed and interested by his dream that I mentioned\nit to several persons\u2014a clerk in my Local Bank, a Bank Manager I\nmet at a monthly Lunch at a 'Settlement' at 12.30 and this last\nrelation was heard by other visitors at that luncheon.\n\" I may perhaps add that the first time I saw Mr Williams after-\nwards, he told me that the wireless announcement which he had the\ncuriosity to listen to was exactly as he had heard it in his dream.\"\nIt will be seen that both Mr Young and Mr Doughty speak of only\none horse. They were questioned further on this point by Mr Bester-\nman and confirmed (in letters dated respectively 17 and 20 March\n1934) the fact that Mr Williams mentioned only the winner to them.\nMr Besterman has interviewed Mr Williams, who, notwithstanding\nhis age, is an excellent witness, and who is quite clear that he did\ndefinitely dream of the first four horses in the race. Even though\nthere is unfortunately no independent evidence of this except in\nregard to the winner, the case is a good one. It has two points of\nspecial interest. The first is that Mr Williams, who is opposed to\nhorse-racing and was at one time the secretary of an anti-betting\norganisation, should have dreamed of the result of the race. Here\na psycho-analytical interpretation might be introduced, on the\nassumption that Mr Williams's strong and yet repressed interest, as\nan opponent, in racing may have emerged in this form. The second\npoint of interest is the fact that normally Mr Williams would not\nhave listened to the description of a horse race, and on that day\ncould not have done so, as his wireless set was out of order and he\nhad no immediate intention of repairing it. Thus the dream in a\nsense brought about its own fulfilment.\nWe are greatly obliged to Mr Williams, and also to Messrs Young\nand Doughty, for the trouble they have kindly taken in this matter.\n\fApril 1934 Correspondence 219\nCORRESPONDENCE\nPrecognition and Psychoanalysis\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014I am obliged to Prof. Dodds for his letter to you in the\nMarch issue. I am so far in agreement with him that I consider that\nit would be highly profitable to psychical research if the methods and\ntechnique of psycho-analysis could be utilised. But I will not sail\nunder false colours. I confess that I do not accept Freud's theories\nin their entirety. Doubtless this will seem heretical to Prof. Dodds.\nbut I am by nature an heretic. I like being an heretic, particularly\nso when, as in this case. I have good companions in my heresy.\nProf. Dodds's \"flat contradiction\n1\n'\ndoes not disturb me ; neither\nhe nor I have any data whatsoever upon which to go. so I do not\npropose to argue the point. I should have thought, however, that\nfor persons living in this country where monkeys are not common\nobjects the tendency would be for some less exotic symbol to be\nemployed. Even if his figures be correct it means that only one out\nof ten or fifteen thousand women in London would have this parti-\ncular dream on any one night and one in ten or fifteen thousand may\nbe considered, if not extremely rare, at least comparatively so. He\ndoes not, however, consider the other side of the matter ; the event\nof being followed by a monkey in London is, I am sure, not one that\nhappens every day. Again I have no statistics, but a fairly long\nacquaintance with life in that city leads me to believe that such a\nthing must be \" extremely rare \"'. Let us suppose that it happens to\none woman once a year. I claim that the probability of it happening\nto one of the hundred women on the day following her having the\ndream is so small that the hypothesis of chance is practically ex-\ncluded.\nIt is true that these unlikely events do occur, as for example in the\ninstance which Prof. Dodds cites, and if the case stood alone we\nshould be justified in putting it down as merely a curious coinci-\ndence. But when we have a large number of instances which agree\nin respect of being cases of apparent precognition, though differing\nin all other respects, I consider that we are bound to assume that\nchance alone could not be responsible for them. If then something\nother than chance is involved we must admit a causal nexus between\nthe two events. Obviously the dream could not be the cause of the\nfulfilling event and it seems to me to be a quite plausible hypothesis\nthat, even if the dream, as Prof. Dodds suggests, symbolised a sexual\nassault, the choice of the symbol was influenced by precognition of an\nactual event.\nI am fortified in this view by the fact that there are many cases in\nwhich, in my unrepentant opinion, even the most extravagant em-\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1934\nployment of Freudian symbolism could not account for the dreams.\nI am aware that the thoroughgoing disciple of Freud's doctrines will\nnot agree, for the resources of the device are so wide that I have no\ndoubt that the financial column of The Times could be construed as a\nsexual article.\nConcerning his next point, viz. the frequency of death precogni-\ntions, I fancy that the matter is not quite so simple as Prof. Dodds\nsupposes. I think that he must have overlooked a remark which I\nmade on page 51. I there said, \" I have classed as Vague those cases\nwhere there was . . . nothing conclusively to connect the event\nwhich is reported as fulfilling the prediction with the alleged precog-\nnition.\" It follows that an hallucination case which consisted solely\nof a phantasmal appearance with no added details to indicate the\nnature of the event, that is to say, whether death, illness, arrival,\nmarriage and so on, would be classed as vague and would not there-\nfore enter into the statistics.\nI do not know whether there is any recognised psychoanalytic\ndoctrine concerning the appearance of repressed death wishes in\nhallucination, but if such wishes are as common as Prof. Dodds\nasserts I maintain that dreams should show at least as high a per-\ncentage of death cases as any of the other types.\nAnd finally as regards symbolism. Seeing that I do not accept\nFreud's doctrine of symbolism to its full extent it seems obvious that\nthe symbols of which I spoke are not Freudian symbols. Where a\ndream depicts in all its details a quite ordinary event which happens\nshortly afterwards, I consider that it is absurd to insist that it is all\nsymbolic.\nAnd anyhow if, as Freud himself admits, telepathy may determine\nthe choice of symbols, the same may be true of precognition, so that\neven if the dream have a symbolic meaning in the Freudian sense it\nmay be, none the less, a true precognition.\nYours, etc.,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014With regard to Professor Dodds's interesting letter in\nthe March Journal under this title\u2014I have always found it difficult\nto believe that the dreams of normal people, who are courageous\nenough to face squarely the facts and consequences of their own\nacts, should be determined by this Freudian dissimulative Fear-\nComplex machinery under the direction of an apprehensive though\nwell-intentioned Censor. The post would be a sinecure.\nIn the case of telepathic dreams their object would clearly be\ndefeated by such an unintelligent use of symbolism.\n\fApril 1934 Correspondence 221\nMrs Stone's famous Train dream (Human Personality (short)\np. 108), the numerous reciprocal dreams recorded passim in Journal\nand Proceedings, and precognitive dreams such as of ducks buried\nup to the neck in sand, are surely outside the category of dreams\namenable to Freudian treatment. Does the Subconscious '\nrout up\n'\nan emotion to fit the symbol of (say) ducks-buried-up-to-the-neck, or\nis a correlative emotion aroused in the Subconscious by the precog-\nnitive impact I There seems to be no reason whatever, except on\nFreudian assumptions, why Subconscious emotions of this kind\nshould play any part in the production of such dreams.\nYours, etc.\nErnest S. Thomas.\nTime and Precognition\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014With reference to Mr H. F. Saltmarsh's most interesting\nand valuable paper on \" Cases of Apparent Precognition\", there are\ntwo points which I should like to raise, both in connection with the\ntheory.\n( 1 ) The first is a minor point . If we adopt any of the symmetrical\narrangements of the line representing the threshold of consciousness,\neither as shown in Fig. 11 or in Fig. 13 or that in which it is asymp-\ntotic, we should expect on the face of it to find cases of precognitive\nsupernormal knowledge and cases of supernormal knowledge of past\nevents appearing in about equal numbers. There are no doubt in-\nstances of the latter\u2014retro or post-cognitions\u2014but I think that they\nare rare in comparison with the number of precognitions. It might\nbe of course that for some reason it is more difficult for subliminal\nknowledge of a past than of a future event to rise into supraliminal\nconsciousness, but one would rather have expected it to be the other\nway about. By post-cognition I here mean periodical accounts of\npast events which never lay within the normal knowledge of the\npercipient.\n(2) The second point concerns the theory of time* which Mr Salt-\nmarsh puts forward. He illustrates this theory on p. 89 by a world-\nstructure represented by a bundle of wires lying more or less parallel\nto one another, which the observer views through a slit moving in a\ndirection parallel with their general length. Now, on this view,\nneither time nor change is a property of the world-structure itself.\nBoth arise out of the cognitive relation which subsists between the\nobserver and the external world. This word is given to him in\nsuccession of specious presents, and it is merely the succession of a\nnumber of sensuous experiences, correlated in a particular way,\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1934\nwhich gives rise in the observer's mind to the idea that change,\nendurance and becoming are characteristics of the external world.\nThis view of time is as subjective a view as is the ordinary, causal\ntheory which science puts forward of the (so-called) '\nsecondary\n'\nqualities of matter. For example, a pillar-box, which common sense\nregards as being itself literally characterised by the quality of red-\nness, is not, according to the scientific view, red in this sense at all.\nIt possesses certain causal properties, in particular the property of\nreflecting electro-magnetic radiation of a certain wave-length, and\nthis, passing into the eye, stimulating the retina and optic nerve and\nso on, ultimately gives rise to the sensation of redness in the mind of\nthe observer. \"Redness\"' on this view, is something which charac-\nterises the observer's experience and is not a quality which is in-\nherent in the pillar-box.\nIf one adopts this scientific view of the nature of redness, one can-\nnot also adopt the common-sense view, which holds, in a naively\nrealistic sense, that redness inheres in the pillar-box, without com-\nmitting a logical inconsistency.\nBut this kind of inconsistency is just what Mr Saltmarsh appears\nto have introduced into his theory of time by postulating movable\nwires in his otherwise fixed world-structure. One or more of the\nwires, he says, (in respect of the whole of its length which lies in the\nfuture of the present moment) may be \"moved\" by a free-will act\non the part of the observer and actor.\nWhat are we to understand by \" motion\"' on the part of the wire ?\nMotion has been implicitly defined, on the theory already adopted,\nas a peculiarity of the observer's mode of cognition of the external\nworld. The observer himself (presumably) endures and is conscious\nof his own enduring. (There is a difference between felt endurance\nand physical time, which latter is divisible into measurable portions.\nMr Saltmarsh himself points this out : he calls them \" psychological\n\"\nand \"mathematician's\" time.) The observer senses successive\ncross-sectional blocks of this external world, which in itself is in some\nway existent but timeless. He senses these blocks in successive\nspecious presents, and this gives him the idea that there is a physical\ntime in which the external world is enduring and changing, and its\nelements are \" moving \". But all the while, time is a subjective affair\nof his own, arising out of a combination of his own sense of enduring\nwith the differences presented by his sense-data.\nNow, if Mr Saltmarsh adopts the subjective view of time, I do\nnot see how he can also, without logical inconsistency, introduce the\nview that his world-fibres (or some of them) exist in a time of their\nown in which they can move. For, clearly if a certain world-fibre,\nin respect of the whole of its future length, is, at the observer's\npresent moment t related to the other world-fibres by a relation R,\n\fApril 1934 Correspondence 223\nand at the observer's present moment t' is related to them by a\ndifferent relation R', then it has undergone a change of relationship\nin a time of its own, which has nothing to do with the purely subjec-\ntive time which is the only time the observer knows of. Mr Salt-\nmarsh, in fact, reverts from a time which arises out of the observer's\ncognitive relation to the external world (shall we call it \" epistemo-\nlogical time \" ?) to a quite different kind of time which has nothing\nto do with any cognitive relation, but is assigned as an inherent\ncharacteristic to that external world itself. (Shall we call this \" onto-\nlogical time\" ? )\nMy contention is that if Mr Saltmarsh is talking about a single\ntime in which the events of the external world occur, then he is\nlogically inconsistent in introducing both epistemological and onto-\nlogical time into his theory. The theory of a \"plastic\" future\nwould therefore seem to be irreconcilable with the view that physical\ntime arises out of a cognitive relation between the observer and the\nexternal world.\nWhether or not it would be possible to avoid this inconsistency by\nasserting that epistemological and ontological time both exist, I do\nnot know. The resulting theory would, I am afraid, be rather dis-\ntressingly complicated and would need a good deal of working out.\nYours, etc.,\nG. N. W. Tyrrell.\n[In regard to Mr Tyrrell's first point, the phenomena of crypto-\nmnesia are by no means rare, far more common, at any rate,\nthan those of precognition ; they are particularly frequent in\nscrying. It might be most convenient to reserve the term retro-\ncognition for paranormal knowledge of past events, that is, of events\nnever known to the percipient. \u2014Ed.]\nImmunity to Fire\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014Much apparently trustworthy evidence about fire walk-\ning has recently been forthcoming from Sir Bindon Blood and others.\nI write to point out the close relation between this and some pheno-\nmena observed by Crookes and others with D. D. Home. In\nProceedings S.P.R., vi. 103 (1890) we read \"Mr Home went to the\nfire and after stirring the hot coal about with his hand, took out a\nred hot piece nearly as big as an orange and putting it on his right\nhand covered it over with his left hand so as to almost completely\nenclose it, and then blew into the small furnace thus extemporised\nuntil the lump of charcoal was nearly white hot, and then drew my\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1934\nattention to the lambent flame which was flickering over the coal\nand licking round his fingers.\"\nIn some respects this is more remarkable than the fire walking\nceremony. On the other hand, the hot coal was not pressed against\nMr Home's hand by the whole weight of a human body.\nYours, etc.\nRayleigh.\nREVIEWS\nSigmund Freud, New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis.\nTranslated by W. J. H. Sprott. 8vo, pp. 240. London : The\nHogarth Press, 1933. Price 10s. 6d. net.\nThese lectures are supplementary to and a continuation of Profes-\nsor Freud's first Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis, some\nbeing critical revisions of past work, whilst others break new ground.\nThe now wide public which follows the development of Professor\nFreud's thought will read these lectures with great interest, but there\nis included in this volume one lecture of especial interest and import-\nance to students of psychical research, that is, Lecture X, on \" Dreams\nand the Occult\".\nHere, for the first time at some length, Professor Freud deals with\nthe thorny subject of the occult, admitting and elucidating the\nreasons for a considerable modification of his earlier views. That he\ndoes so modify them is yet another corroboration of Professor\nFreud's scientific willingness to revise his opinions when he observes\nnew facts ; and these facts, even to those people who do not fully\naccept the psycho-analytic interpretation, are of great interest and\nimportance to the study of telepathy and kindred phenomena.\nAfter summarising his instinctive disinclination towards occult\nmatters, Professor Freud, who evidently addresses an audience even\nmore averse to the subject than he is himself, outlines the difficulties\nof investigation, and explains his particular approach through\npsycho-analysis. Physical phenomena, he decides, with the neces-\nsary modern methods of control, are best left to experts and their\nreport awaited. He chooses, therefore, the dreams of his patients,\nand the analysis of the dream contents, as his field for observation,\nfor it was his experience with these which led him to entertain the\npossibility of telepathy. The results of analysis suggested that occa-\nsionally, in the patient's associations, a residue was arrived at that\ncould best be accounted for on the hypothesis that it was the direct\nimpression from another mind. In Professor Freud's words, \" If\nthen one comes across a so-called telepathic dream, one can convince\noneself by its analysis that the telepathic message has played the\n\fApril 1931 Reviews 225\nsame role as any other residue of waking life, and as such has been\naltered by the dream work and made to serve its purpose.\"\nSeveral interesting illustrations of such analysis are given and\nProfessor Freud proceeds to another group of experiences wherein\nhe finds admirable opportunities for making observations on thought\ntransference, that is, in the experiences of his patients with profes-\nsional clairvoyants. In this group of cases analysis strongly suggests\nthat it is the unconscious wishes of the sitter which are telepathically\nreceived by the clairvoyant, and expressed in the form of prophecy.\nThere is this case, for instance. A patient of Professor Freud's\nrelated how. on consulting an astrologer, he was told that his brother-\nin-law would die in a few months of poisoning from crabs or lobsters.\nThe prophecy was not fulfilled, but the brother-in-law did become\nill from this cause. The importance given by the patient to this\ncoincidence confirmed the findings of analysis that he was suffering\nfrom repressed hatred of his brother-in-law. and this hatred had pro-\nvoked the wish that the taste for shell-fish might some day prove\nfatal. Professor Freud suggests that it was this repressed wish\nwhich had been telepathically received by the astrologer, and given\nout again in the form of prophecy. He remarks, with some dryness,\nand with characteristic economy of emphasis, that he prefers this\nexplanation to the belief that one can calculate the onset of shell-fish\npoisoning by consulting astrological tables.\nTo quote one case can give little idea of the suggestiveness of\nProfessor Freud's observations, but those who in the course of\nresearch work have sat often with clairvoyants, and who have\nattained a measure of self-analysis will, from their own experiences,\nwarmly corroborate this view.\nSome of the cases quoted by Professor Freud suffer admittedly\nfrom omissions which have to be made for reasons of professional\nsecrecy, and the critical reader will probably differ as to the impres-\nsiveness of some cases as they are presented, and will ask whether\nperhaps enough allowance has been made for coincidence, or for\naccidentally acquired knowledge. Strangely enough it is especially\nin the case of Dr Forsyth (page 66), which seems to have made a great\nimpression on Professor Freud, where these doubts will arise most\nstrongly. However, as Professor Freud is the last person to claim\nany evidential weight from one case alone, these criticisms are per-\nhaps of small importance in comparison with the value of Professor\nFreud's suggestive contribution to the study of the occult.\nHe will not be tempted very far into speculation, perhaps that is\nnot possible in the scope of a lecture, and such speculations as he\nmakes, in a brief summary of his views, suggest that thought-\ntransference favours a mechanistic view of the \" elusive world of the\nmind\". \"What lies between two mental acts, (i.e. between agent and\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1934\npercipient) may well be a physical process. His thought here (or\nperhaps the thought has eluded the skill of the translator) is a little\ndifficult to follow, and we are not quite clear what is meant when\nhe says \" by inserting the unconscious between the physical and\nwhat has hitherto been regarded as the mental, psycho-analysis\nhas prepared the way for the acceptance of such processes as tele-\npathy.\"\nIt is clear, however, that his interpretation is mechanistic, and\nhowever widely the reader may differ, in interpretation, he cannot\nfail to be grateful for the encouragement given to the study of the\noccult due to Professor Freud's valuable suggestions. The facts of\ntelepathy will gain in reality when they are seen to take place natur-\nally and in accordance with the habits of the rest of the personality,\nand the student of the occult must be entirely conscious of the wish\nthat Professor Freud will have the opportunity to observe some of\nthe most puzzling occult phenomena, such as are presented by\nmediumistic controls, and to subject them to his fruitful analytic\ntreatment.\nMeanwhile, that Professor Freud should plead that his readers\n\"should think more kindly of the objective possibility of thought-\ntransference, and therefore also of telepathy ''\nwill encourage those\nwho are already at work on the problems, and perhaps also make\nnew recruits from the ranks of the sceptics.\nIna Jephson.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS\nJournal of the American Society for Psychical Research .\nFebruary 1934.

H. Salter in the Chair.\nThe Rev. C. Drayton Thomas read a paper entitled \" A Proxy\nCase extending over Twelve Sittings with Mrs Leonard.\"' Lantern\nslides were shown illustrating many of the items touched upon.\nThe following account, by Mr Thomas, is considerably abridged.\nIn September 1932 there came an appeal from a family in the\nnorth of England asking if I would attempt to obtain information\nfrom a boy of ten who had recently died from diphtheria . The family\nwere not Spiritualists and had no strong expectation that I should\nsucceed. They apparently wrote to me owing to their having read\nof my having taken proxy sittings.\nIn such proxy attempts I had rarely continued beyond a second\nor third sitting. In the present case there emerged a special feature\nwhich decided me to persevere, and this paper gives a summary of\nthe result from twelve sittings.\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1934\nBeyond the letter of appeal I knew nothing of the applicants, and\nthey gave away no unnecessary information. From the beginning\nthe evidential matter received rose far beyond the reach of chance\ncoincidence. For example, in one of the earlier sittings it was\nstated that his people had a photograph of the boy, Bobbie, standing\nfull-faced, with a board in front of him. Also that he had been fond\nof wearing on his head something in the nature of a joke, a cap with\nno peak to it, and which the boy considered rather important.\nThe family replied, \" This is certainly remarkable. The last\nphotograph we have of Bobbie is in fancy-dress. He is the Jack\nof Hearts with boards back and front like a sandwich-man. On\nhis head is a crown as in a pack of cards. He was so fond of putting\nit on that his mother had to check him lest it should be worn out.\"\nThe boy also told of an important engagement which his mother\nhad made for a Saturday afternoon and said he believed that his\nbeing taken ill must have interfered with this engagement.\nBobbie's mother reported that such an engagement had been fixed\nfor the Saturday after Bobbie's death. It was with the Brownies,\nof which she was an officer. The boy knew that his mother was to\nhave spent that afternoon with the Brownies. He was taken ill on\nthe previous Sunday. Directly his illness became serious his mother\npostponed the engagement, so that Bobbie's death on the Thursday\ndid in fact prevent her taking the Saturday engagement.\nBobbie also stated that some foods that most boys liked he\nobjected to, and there was one particular food which he was very\ndifficult about, and yet it had been given him only a little while\nbefore he passed over. It was one of his pet aversions although\nquite an ordinary food which most boys would have liked.\nThis statement was correct. The boy had been funny about food.\nHe never touched jam, nor even a cake that had jam in it. He also\ndisliked milk. But his pet aversion was the white of egg. His\nmother writes, \" Bobbie hated it and always left it but I was\nbeginning to insist that he should try to eat it.\"\nBobbie also stated that he had been interested in going to some-\nthing like a chemist's shop, although it was not really a shop but a\nplace with bottles and weighing things, instruments and such-like.\nIt was described as \" a clean, white place with bottles and measuring\nthings.\"\nOne of the family replied, \" This is very good. I had much to\ndo with a laboratory in the town and Bobbie liked to go there with\nme. The reference to the taps, bottles and weighing things is quite\ncorrect.\"\nThere are more than fifty successful evidential items of like\nnature in addition to descriptions of the locality. So long a list\nwould be tedious if given in detail. It is sufficient to have shown\n\fMai 1934 Private Meetings 231\nthat references to the child's home and personal interests pass far\nbeyond the longest reach of chance coincidence.\nShortly after the sittings commenced the family sent three\nquestions, and subsequently added a further two. In my mind I\nsettled what the probable answers would be, but only one of my\nguesses was correct and it happened that that was the question to\nwhich Bobbie attempted no answer. Detailed information was\ngiven in reply to the remaining four, and close examination showed\nthat my thoughts on the matter had not influenced the replies.\nHere, as always, I failed to find any hint of telepathy between me\nand the medium.\nA conspicuous feature of these communications was the detailed\ndescription of the neighbourhood from the boy's point of view. It\nwas not the sort of information which would have been picked up\nfrom map or guide-book but exactly the kind which would result\nfrom a boy's memory of favourite walks. The first of these descrip-\ntions had ten points, all given with accuracy except one, which\nreferred to a broken stile. But that in itself was particularly inter-\nesting because the broken stile had been there during the boy s\nlifetime and had been removed before the date of the sitting. This\nalone should incline us to think that the description was given from\nthe memory of one who had known the facts in Bobbie's lifetime,\nrather than by any clairvoyance whether of medium or control.\nThe latter hypothesis would lead us into the difficulty of having to\nsuggest how clairvoyance was directed to the right town, and was\nthen able to trace, amidst its many scores of streets and paths, the\nparticular route which had been the favourite walk of the family.\nNeither to Mrs Leonard in her normal state, nor to the control\nduring the sitting did I give any clue as to the town in which Bobbie\nhad lived.\nThe description of a broken stile which no longer exists, but\nwhich did exist in the communicator's lifetime, was paralleled in\none of my previous proxy sittings where was given a detailed and\nminutely accurate description of a garden. But that description,\nin its most striking features, was correct only for the summer time,\nwhereas it was received in the winter. In that case, as in the above,\nclairvoyance seems to be ruled out.\nI have previously said that a special feature decided me to per-\nsevere with this case and we now come to consider this ; it might\nbe termed the mystery of the pipes. My regular communicators,\n\u2014\nmy father and my sister, \u2014usually assist strangers who come to give\nevidence. At the beginning of this case they told me they had dis-\ncussed matters with Bobbie and helped him to select suitable\nevidence.\nQuite early in the series my father stated that although the boy\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research mat 1934\nhad died suddenly from diphtheria something had happened nine\nweeks before which in a sense led up to it. My sister and Bobbie\non different occasions repeated this assertion, and, when I asked if\nthey could give some clue to this, I was told that the word \" pipes\n\"\nshould be sufficient.\nThe family replied that this conveyed nothing to them, and that,\nso far as they could recollect, there had been no event nine weeks\nbefore the boy's death which could in any sense be thought to\nconnect with it.\nOwing to this expression of opinion, and to the family's failure\nto realise what pipes were meant, I thought it important to discover\nwhat and where these pipes might be. This finally led to the dis-\ncovery of something quite unknown to the family, namely the\nexistence of pipes in a remote spot where Bobbie had frequently\nplayed.\nSix months elapsed before the existence of these pipes was dis-\ncovered, and meanwhile the communicators at almost every sitting\nwere giving clue after clue, thus leading us finally to the spot where\nthe pipes were found. ;\nfj\nThe whole story centres round the fact that Bobbie and a boy\nfriend had formed themselves into a secret society which they called\n\" the Gang,\" and in the early summer had begun to frequent a place\ncalled \" The Heights \" for play and adventure. Being a secret\nsociety they did not divulge the exact whereabouts of the playing\nground..\nAmong the clues that were given was a perfect and explicit de-\nscription of the route from Bobbie's home up to the Heights. This\ndescription included the name of the street where the boy's school\nwas situated and a reference to the Stocks one would pass on the way.\nIt was three months after the broaching of this mystery that the\nfamily discovered the general direction of the place where the\n\" Gang \" had played : but the area was large and unfamiliar to the\nfamily and they remained quite oblivious of the fact that two pipes\nwere there through which water issued from springs.\nNo local maps are to be had, whether in guide-book or directory,\nand it was not until these sittings were over that I inspected an\nordnance survey map, both the large scale and the small. I found\nthat springs are indicated but that there is no mention of the pipes.\nIt was not until six months after the first mention of the pipes\nthat I visited Bobbie's home. While I was being shown some of the\narticles mentioned in these sittings, I discovered that the child had\nkept a diary. I asked to see this, and turning to the date nine weeks\nbefore his death on August 10th I scanned that and the next page,\nlooking for anything that might connect with illness. I had in my\nmind the sitting of the previous December which I here quote :\n\fMat 1934 Private Meetings 233\n\" Nine weeks before Bobbie passed over there was something that\nought to have been very significant in the face of his passing, some-\nthing that in a sense led up to it.\" Now Feda gave that as from my\nfather, and fifteen years' experience of Mrs Leonard assured me that\nanything he said through her would be based on fact. Nine weeks\nbefore August 10th would be June 8th. Nothing relevant appeared\nthere, but on turning the page I was arrested by two entries, \" June\n16. Had some toffee and two ice-creams \" and \" June 17. Joined\nthe Gang.\" Certainly ice-creams would be a possible source of in-\nfection, but mention of the Gang aroused my curiosity, and I then\nlearned for the first time about the secret society and the place\nselected by Bobbie and his friend for their escapades and adventures\nin the summer. It seemed desirable that we should explore that\nneighbourhood, and accordingly we started forth, taking the route\nwhich had been so clearly indicated in the proxy communications.\nI found it a wild, romantic spot, and for a while we wandered on\nwithout definite aim, looking round for anything which might match\nwith the clues given in the sittings of the last six months. The\nground was rough and it was necessary to look where one stepped.\nWhile doing this I suddenly caught sight of hoof marks in the soil.\nOne of the clues had been \" Animals will be the best clue \"\u2014these\nwords flashed across my mind. Clearly animals had been here.\nFrom whence had they come ? None were in sight and I looked\nround wondering. As I looked, I saw, over the rough stone wall\nabove me, the roof of a shed. \" Barn or stables \" was another of the\nclues. It had been given thus :\nFeda :\n\" They are showing me like stables now, barns or stables,\nand straw in big bundles. I have to call it a barn : on\none side nearly or all open, more like a shelter place.\nIt was not all built at the same time. There was some-\nthing built on afterwards.\"\nHurriedly clambering over the stone walls, so characteristic of\nthat neighbourhood, we came to the near end of the shed. A glance\nsufficed to show that this part of the shed was used as a stable.\nEmerging from the stable we examined the shed. It had appar-\nently been added to from time to time, and that was another clue.\nThe further end of the shed was open and showed bundles of straw.\nThat made two more clues verified.\nThere was no doubt that we were hot on the track of the pipes.\nSo many clues had been verified that we might well expect that the\nobject to which they were intended to lead us was now close at hand.\nYet nothing in the way of pipes was visible, look where we would.\nAs I stood there discussing matters with the family the unex-\npected happened. It began with the sight of a woman carrying a\nbucket and walking towards us. At this point it is necessary to\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mai 1934\nrevert to what, at the time it was given, seemed an attempt to\nforecast the future.\nMy communicators were speaking about Bobbie's connection\nwith the pipes. They said :\n\" We know we are right and that if inquiries are quietly persisted\nin it may eventually come to light. Bobbie himself is wishful that\nthis might be so, and two or three friends of his who have passed\nover are also helping, so that sooner or later the matter will be\nbrought to light in what will appear to be an accidental and yet per-\nfectly natural manner.\"\nNeither then nor later could one form the least idea as to how\nthis could come about, but now, in a manner apparently accidental,\nand yet perfectly natural, we were to find one of those pipes within\nthe next few minutes.\nAs the woman with the bucket approached it struck me that in\nall probability we were trespassing ; for we had climbed over more\nthan one wall to reach the shed. I therefore greeted her with a\nremark upon the beauty and extent of the view from where we were\nstanding. She responded suitably and we were soon in the midst of\nconversation. With the puzzle of the pipes revolving in my mind,\nI inquired whether children came to play there. She replied with\nsome animation that they certainly did, and not only so, but that\nthey often did mischief to the property ; for instance, they had\nrecently broken her pipe.\nThis mention of a pipe, while we were standing on the very spot\nto which the clues had led us, awakened the hope that the end of\nour quest was near. And so it was. For further inquiries elicited\nthe information that partway down the hill there was a spring from\nwhich water issued through a pipe.\nWe proceeded down the hillside and presently came to a spring.\nWater gushed from the earth by the side of the displaced pipe.\nIt was an iron pipe several feet in length, and, before its breakage,\nthe water had flowed through it. We had found one pipe, and it\nwas in the place to which the clues had led us. The discovery was\ndue to the apparently accidental meeting with the woman ; for' it\nis distinctly unlikely that we could have found the spring and its\npipe but for her chance remark. Indeed we had not suspected its\nexistence when visiting the place a few days earlier. The pipe is\nquite inconspicuous and not visible until one comes near, being\nhidden by the formation of the ground.\nI was now at a loss to understand why the word had always been\nused in the plural. But further exploration discovered a second pipe,\na little further on, through which water was issuing from a spring.\nThe mystery of the pipes was at length solved. They were water\npipes.\n\fMat 1034 Private Meetings 235\nThis spring water is quite pure, but it is otherwise with the pools\nformed where it flows upon the soil. These would be visited by\nrats, wild birds, poultry, and other animals, and contaminated by\nthem. The drinking of such contaminated water by a child like\nBobbie, whose constitution had always been delicate, would be\nlikely to induce a condition of blood which might not readily reveal\nitself but which would put him at a disadvantage when attacked\nby illness. Such a sub-acute condition of infection might continue\nfor some time without manifesting itself. We are certain that Bobbie\nfrequently played by these pipes for several weeks. Then came the\nillness which began with tonsilitis, turned to quinsy, and then to\ndiphtheria, which overcame him.\nI have before me a report from the local Medical Officer of Health\nsaying that if a child drank from the water in these pools it would\nbe decidedly injurious to him.\nThis outline would be unduly lengthened by the inclusion of all\nthe references to Bobbie's death being traceable to infection from\nthe pipes. They were numerous, they were explicit, and, although\nnot verified for half a year, were proved ultimately to be accurate.\nAnalysis gives the following results. In the twelve sittings there\nwere 216 evidential items, and of these only 12 were definitely\nwrong. Examining these we find that one was Etta's opinion about\nBobbie's general health. Feda was twice wrong while describing\nwhat communicators \" showed \" her\u2014apparently defective clair-\nvoyance on her part. The boy made nine errors ; 3 were his\nexpressions of opinion about happenings in the home since his\ndeath ; other 3 were either defective recollection or blurred trans-\nmission ; while the remaining 3 were attempts at proper names\n\u2014and Feda is often uncertain when trying to catch names.\nBesides the above errors, there were 12 items too vague to count,\nand 24 which remain doubtful.\nThe astonishing thing is that no less than 1 68 items were correct\n;\nin other words, in every nine statements seven have proved true to\nfact. Such a proportion of success discredits any criticism based\nupon the possibilities of chance coincidence.\nI close with a remark of Feda's, \" Some of the things I have got\nfrom them I didn't understand ; and just a little bit of a twist\nwould give them a wrong meaning.\"\nA discussion followed, in which Mrs Lyttelton, Miss Candler, The\nRev. J. W. Hayes, Mr Theodore Besterman, Dr. E. S. Dingwall,\nMr Hettinger, Mrs Adlercron, and Lady Barrett took part. It\ncentred round the question of the pipes : the quality of the water\nin them ; whether the boy-friend who would know of the pipes had\nbeen interrogated (this had been impossible owing to the effect of\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat 1934\nthe shock of Bobby's death) ; whether the communicator might\nhave had water suggested to him as the source of his illness when\nstill alive ;\nand, finally, round the question as to whether chance\ncoincidence could account for the references to pipes. In regard to\nthis, Dr. Dingwall and Mr Besterman agreed that they thought that\nchance coincidence might account for the references to pipes ; and\nMr Besterman pointed out that everything in that connexion de-\npended upon whether the pipes were in fact the cause of Bobby's\ndeath. If they were, it was most important, and chance coin-\ncidence was ruled out ; if not, there was no link between the death\nand the pipes.\nTelepathy and the Listener-In\nThe 128th Private Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday,\n28 March 1934, at 5.30 p.m., The President in the Chair.\nMrs W. H. Salter read a paper entitled \" Telepathy and the\nListener-in,\" in which she reviewed the correspondence she had\nreceived after her B.B.C. talk on telepathy, and related several\ncases that had been reported to her, some of which, it is hoped,\nwill be printed in the Journal.\nA discussion followed, Mr Hettinger, Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart.,\nand the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas taking part.\nCASES\nDream of a Monkey\nL. 1300.\nMiss Hertha B. C. Sollas, Southwell, 85 South End Road, London,\nN.W. 3, wrote as follows to Professor Broad in a letter dated 23\nMarch 1934 :\n\" I enclose herewith an account of two dreams which seem to be\ntelepathic. When I have a dream or impression which seems\nsignificant I report them at once to my friend, in order to have a\nwitness, but do not write them down. I have collected these two\nexperiences because the subjects are unusual.\n\" [Signed] H. Sollas.\"\nOne of the two dreams described is a little too vague to be repro-\nduced. The other is thus described by Miss Sollas :\n\" A vivid dream that a small monkey was running about on the\nhedge along our garden path. I told my friend this dream at\nbreakfast. In the afternoon I visited a friend who asked me if she\nmight bring someone to tea who had a small monkey. When the\nmonkey came it ran about in some trellis work parallel to the\nhedge.\"\n\fMay 1934 Cases 237\nIn reply to some questions sent to her by Mr Besterman, Miss\nSollas writes, in a letter dated 15 April 1934 :\n\" In reply to your letter of the 12th April, it is difficult at this\ntime to fix the exact date of my dream about the monkey. (1) The\nyear was definitely 1928 and the month must have been early June.\nPlace, above address.\n\" (2) I enclose an independent statement by Miss Parry.\"\n[In the next two paragraphs Miss Sollas gives the names and\naddresses of the friend who came to tea and of her friend whom\nshe brought with her and who owned the monkey.]\n\" (5) I did not know of the existence of the monkey until I had\ntea with Miss B.\n\" In my dream I was particularly struck by the quick movements\nof the monkey, and observed it more keenly than I should in life.\nThe colour of the dream monkey was slightly greyer and paler than\nthat of the real monkey.\"\nThe enclosed statement, from the same address_and dated 15\nApril 1934, reads as follows :\n\" I beg to corroborate Miss Sollas' story of her dream about the\nmonkey. She told me this story at breakfast before we knew of\nthe existence of the monkey. A few days later Miss F. brought\nher monkey to tea. It ran about on the trellis and refused to\ncome in.\n\" [Signed] G. M. Parry.\"\nIn a further letter Miss Sollas kindly stated that she had no\nobjection to the printing of this account. Both she and Miss Parry\nare former students of Newnham College. In view of the recent\ndiscussion in the Journal about dreams of monkeys, it is interesting\nso soon to have another to record. Although it is admittedly not a\nvery rare thing for women to dream of monkeys, the correspondence\nin time and situation between the dream and the event in the\npresent case is sufficiently close to make a telepathic explanation\nnot improbable.\nAn Impression coinciding with an Illness subsequently\nFatal\nL. 1301.\n[The following is one of the cases sent to Mrs Salter as a result\nof her broadcast request for supernormal experiences, a report of\nwhich was read to the Society at a Private Meeting on 28 March\n1934. All the documents involved are in Mrs Salter's possession,\nand permission was given to use the name of the percipient, \u2014Mrs\nHumphries,\u2014who wrote :\n]\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1934\n\" Strangely enough I had a telepathic experience impression\nfrom my brother in Australia two years ago. . . . He was taken\nsuddenly ill and to a Nursing Home there. He had some great\ndomestic trouble and his nerves gave way. I seemed to feel all\nhe did. I went out walking and when I came home I was so un-\nstrung that my husband who had never seen me like this before\nwas at a loss what to do for me. I said I knew something was\nvery wrong and wrote to a sister there [in Australia] at once to\nenquire. Date was Oct. 23rd [1931]. Before there was time to\nreceive her reply a cable came telling of his death, Nov. 13 ; cable\nsaid '\nafter exactly three weeks illness.' The subsequent letter\nconfirmed everything. He was calling me at the time too and\nthought his nurse was I. . .\n.\"\nIn reply Mrs Salter wrote to Mrs Humphries putting the following\nquestions :\n1. Could she send a corroborative statement from her husband ?\n2. Could Mrs Salter see the letter she had received from her sister\nin Australia ?\n3. As she referred to her brother having had \" great domestic\ntrouble \" and apparently had known of this at the time of\nher experience, had she any special reason to be anxious at\nthat time.\nIn reply to this last question, Mrs Humphries wrote :\n\" His\ndomestic trouble was of two years standing and I was not worrying\nabout him at the time, but it came to a climax suddenly, which\nmade him so ill. He was taken suddenly ill enough to make it\nnecessary to be taken to a Nursing Home on the date Oct 23rd.\"\nMrs Humphries then went on to describe the nature of the crisis\nwhich occurred in her brother's life\n1\nand suggested that the state\nof nervous collapse which this caused may have contributed to her\nexperience,\n\u2014\" this awful chaos of his mind which he conveyed\nto me.\"\nWith Mrs. Humphries' second letter was enclosed a corroborative\nstatement from her husband as follows :\n\" I wish to testify to my wife's declaration concerning her\nexperience on October 23rd 1931, which subsequently proved\nto be the beginning of her brother's illness.\n\" I arrived home and found her in a most alarming state of\nemotion. I have never seen her in any way so upset before.\nShe is a very level-headed woman.\"\n1\n1 do not think it necessary to print Mrs Humphries' statement as to the\nnature of her brother's trouble : it seems clear that she had no special reason\nto be anxious about him at the time of her experience. H. de G. S.\n\fMay 1934 Cases 239\nAs further confirmatory evidence Mrs Humphries sent two\ndocuments :\n1. The cable received from her sister in Australia announcing her\nbrother's death. It was a \" weekend telegram \" from Perth,\nreceived in London on November 16, 1931, addressed to Humphries\nat the address from which the percipient wrote to Mrs Salter, and\nread as follows :\n\" Jim passed away Friday evening [Nov. 13] after three weeks\nillness from heart failure Eva.\"\nThree weeks from November 13 brings us to October 24th. Mrs\nHumphries' impression was on October 23rd, so that, allowing for\nthe fact that Australian time is about ten hours in advance of ours,\nthe coincidence is very close.\n2. The other document sent to Mrs Salter by Mrs Humphries was\na photograph of her brother's grave in Australia upon which the\ninscription was clearly legible :\nC. J.

Williams's\ndream of Hyperion winning the Derby, and Mr Saltmarsh's and\nMr Thomas's letters in the Journal for April, I fell asleep and dreamt\nthat I wrote what follows in the form of an Editorial comment on\nMr Williams's dream :\n\" In view of the familiar association between Hyperion and a\nSatyr, '\na psycho-analytical interpretation might '\n\u2014indeed, must\u2014\n'\nbe introduced.' It is clear that the dreamer is, unhappily, not one\nof those '\nnormal people who are courageous enough to face squarely\nthe facts and consequences of their own acts,' and that his '\nstrong\nand yet repressed interest ' in Satyrs emerged in the form\n'\nHyperion.'\n\" It has been objected that the resources of the device employed\nin the Freudian method of dream-analysis are '\nso wide that the\nfinancial column of The Times could be construed as a sexual\narticle ;\n'\nbut the explanation here offered of the true inwardness\nof Mr Williams's dream is so simple and straightforward, and so\ncompletely ignores the coincidence between the dream and the result\nof the race, that it can hardly be said to involve the use of any\ndevice at all.\"\nThen, in the way in which events in dreams get telescoped, I\nfound myself arguing with the Editor of the Journal, who had\nrefused to accept my contribution on the ground that it might\ncause offence to Mr Williams, and also deter others from sending\n\fMat 1934 Correspondence \u2022241\nin accounts of their dreams. I was saying in reply, \" Well, what\nabout the psycho-analytical interpretation of Mrs C.'s dream about\na monkey that you printed in the March Journal 1\n\" when the\nEditor banged the door, and this woke me up.\nYours, etc.\nj Q Piddington.\nP.S.\u2014I should add, perhaps, that I have no objection to anyone\nintroducing a psycho-analytical interpretation of my dream,\nalthough, I fear, it may bear some discreditable\u2014and undreamt\nof\u2014significance.\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014With reference to the Dodds-Saltmarsh \" Woman\nchased by Monkey Dream Controversy \" I would suggest that\nthe widespread popularity of Mr Burrough's \" Tarzan \" series of\nnovels must have raised enormously the number of the occurrences\nof that particular type of dream. Tarzan is a man-ape whose\nadventures are mainly of an amatory character\u2014pursuing, or being\npursued by, a heroine of a supposedly higher evolutionary status\nthan himself.\nIs it also possible that our controversialists have overlooked the\nsignificance of King Kong ? Yours, etc.,\nQ w -pisK\nDream of the Result of a Race\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014Far be it from me to seem to underestimate the un-\nusualness of a Quaker's dreaming correctly the result of a race (see\nthe Journal, April 1934, pp. 216-8) but I would venture to suggest\nto your readers that the significance of his dream was not perhaps\nas great as people might suppose who have no interest in horse-\nracing. If I am not mistaken, Hyperion started a firm favourite\nfor last year's Derby, with King Salmon equally firmly established\nas second favourite. Statisticians will be able to show that the\nodds against their finishing first and second were considerable, but,\non the other hand, the odds against any other two horses finishing\nin those positions were greater still. In other words, if any Quaker\nwas going to dream the result of the Derby on the morning of the\nrace, he might reasonably forecast it in the way in which the gentle-\nman did to whom you refer. Had the result of the race been a\nsurprise, or had he dreamed the correct result some time before the\nrace, the phenomenon would be of greater interest to both psychical\nresearchers and lay backers. Yours truly,\nC. E. Bechhofer Roberts.\n\f24*2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 193'4\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014In reference to the very interesting Dream Case reported\nin the April Journal : though it is, I think, clearly inferred that the\ndream was right, would it not have made the account somewhat\nmore clinching if the result of the race had been stated ? A search\nof Whitakers Almanack reveals that it was won by a horse named\n\" Hyperion,\" but the name of the second is not mentioned\nthere.\nFrom the above you will gather that, like the dreamer in this case,\nI take no interest in horseracing. And it so happens that, a year\nor two ago, when this particular race was imminent, I had a similar\ndream, but a much less clear one, or, at least, much less clearly\nremembered. It appears, however, that, in the morning I said to\nmy wife (who takes a slight annual interest in this race) that I\nthought it might be won by a horse whose name began with \" A \"\nand ended with \" th,\" and that she searched the list for a name\nsomething like \" Ardath.\" The name of the winner that year was\n\" April the Fifth.\" My wife says now that, when I, in turn, looked\ndown the list, I picked out this name ; but I rather feel she is\nsubconsciously improving a hesitating suggestion, one among others.\nAt anyrate, she admits that she did not \" put anything on it,\"\nthough she adds that she can \" never forgive herself !\n\"\nYours, etc.,\nHubert Wales.\n[The result of the 1933 Derby was 1. Hyperion, 2. King Salmon,\n3. Statesman, 4. Scarlet Tiger.\n\u2014\nHon. Ed.]\nTime and Precognition\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014I am grateful to Mr Tyrrell for his interesting comments\non my paper on Precognitions.\nAs regards his first point I need add little to your own remarks.\nI think that besides cryptomnesia, properly speaking, there are\nnumerous examples of retrocognition in the sense in which you use\nthat term, viz., paranormal knowledge of past events. If Mr\nTyrrell will refer to my report on the Warren Elliott sittings he will\nfind that I there suggested an hypothesis to account for the function\nof the relic which was based on an extension of the subliminal\nspecious present of the medium.\nAlthough it lies outside the proper sphere of psychical research I\nmay be permitted to add that it seems possible to me that a plausible\ntheory of normal memory might be constructed on a similar basis.\n\fMat 1934 Correspondence 243\nMr Tyrrell's second point raises matters of great interest but I\nfear that the pages of the Journal are hardly a suitable arena for\nany gladiatorial combats on abstruse metaphysical & epistemo-\nlogical questions. As I know from experience such discussions\nare apt to be, in fact can hardly help being, very long drawn out.\nI think, therefore, my reply to this point must be to extend to\nMr Tyrrell a most hearty invitation \" to step outside & take his\ncoat off \" when I am sure we shall both enjoy ourselves immensely.\nHowever, lest it be thought that I am simply shirking the issue, I\nwill briefly sketch the lines on which I should conduct my defence.\nMr Tyrrell accuses me of logical inconsistency. I cheerfully admit\nthe charge. Had my suggested hypothesis exhibited perfect logical\nconsistency throughout I should have regarded it with the gravest\nsuspicion, because I hold that true time, being an abstraction from\nreal change, i.e. the coming into existence of something entirely\nnew, & hence undetermined, is necessarily non-rational or, as\nCampbell puts it, suprarational. It violates the fundamental\nprinciples of logic.\nMy position in the matter is briefly as follows. If the universe\nis completely determined I hold that there is no true time, though\nevents are subject to temporal order or location. But seeing that\nevents are presented to us as a series I hold that we, as conscious\nbeings, are subject to true time, & that there must therefore be a\nstrand of indetermination somewhere running through the whole\nsystem. The existence of this strand of indetermination does not\nimply that we possess freewill, though the converse is true, that is\nto say, freewill implies indetermination.\nAs to whether we do possess freewill or not I am, theoretically,\ncompletely uncertain, though practically I suppose that, like most\npeople, I accept the libertarian view, at anyrate, I act as though\nI did.\nBut whether the necessitarian or libertarian view be correct, the\nexistence of this strand of indetermination renders it impossible to\nhold that the universe is rational through & through. By this I\nmean that the course of events is such that the processes of logical\nreasoning are not properly applicable to all of it. I can see no\nsufficient reason for holding that the universe must be rational\nthroughout & I think that I can see good reasons for holding the\nopposite opinion.\nIt is not surprising therefore, that any hypothesis dealing with\ntrue time, indetermination or freewill should exhibit logical\ninconsistencies.\nYours, etc.,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1934\nOn Cases of Precognition\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014I would like to add a word on the subject of \" Pre-\ncognition,\" since I cannot suppose Mr Saltmarsh to be serious.\nIt is true, of course, that women are not followed by monkeys\nevery day in London. But how many women have children who\nhabitually walk down a lane on one side of which a pet monkey\nresides ? For this is what happened in the case under discussion.\nWe merely have a woman dreaming she is pursued by a monkey\nand then going for a walk past a house where one is living and from\nwhich it has escaped !\nAs to the case of Mr Williams printed on pp. 216-218 of the April\nJournal, I see that we are told that \" the case is a good one.\" I\nconfess I do not understand the standards of evidence now accepted\nby the Society. Hyperion was one of the fancied horses. Capt.\nHeath of the News Chronicle was \" committed to Hyperion \" on\nMay 30th 1933 (cf. the issue of May 26, where the words occur, \" I\nanticipate the success of Hyperion \"), and a photo of the animal was\nprinted on May 30th. Other journals also dealt with the possi-\nbility of success, but apparently the normal sources of Mr Williams's\nknowledge were not investigated. If this be \" precognition \" then\nit is indeed common !\nYours, etc.,\nE. J. Dingwall.\n[In regard to neither of the cases to which he refers do Mr Ding-\nwall's comments seem to us quite fair : (1) Most people will agree\nwith Mr Saltmarsh that it is an \" extremely rare \" incident for a\nwoman to be followed by a monkey in a London street ; (2) Mr\nDingwall entirely ignores the fact that Mr Williams, who appears\nto be \" a good witness,\" dreamt according to his own statement of\nthe first two horses, Hyperion and King Salmon, in the right order.\nMr Dingwall also ignores the editorial comment (xxviii. 218), which\nmakes it clear that the interest of the case was considered to be\npartly psychological.\n\u2014\nHon.

Port Sunlight, wrote as\nfollows to the President in a letter dated 23 February 1934 :\n\" Having heard your talk . . . thought I would write to you about\na dream I had at Christmas twelve months back. I will not go\ninto details, the dream came true, sorry to say. I dreamt that my\nchum who live[d] next door was killed. That was Christmas Eve.\nHe was crossing the road two days later, & was knocked down by\na large lorry & killed. It was a terrible dream. I told my wife &\ndaughter about the dream, but they thought it a joke. I rather\nblamed myself for not telling him, but did not wish to upset him.\"\nMr Besterman asked for fuller particulars and for corroborative\nstatements from Mr Moore's wife and daughter. In reply he re-\nceived the following letter, dated 20 March 1934 :\n\". . . I had no thoughts of my friend because my mind was full\nof Christmas, but at about 2 p.m. in the morning I dreamt that I\nsaw my friend and next door neighbour\u2014whose name was Cecil\nHaughton\u2014run over and killed. I awoke perspiring and imme-\ndiately told my wife of the dream. I mentioned it the next morning\nto my daughter who remarked that it was a horrible thing to dream.\nAs Mr Haughton had been away from business suffering from\nneurasthenia I hesitated to tell him of the dream, but did mention\nthat I had been dreaming of him.\nOn December 30th he was killed when crossing the road a few\nyards from his own house. I told his widow of course that this\nwas my dream.\nSo that my wife and daughter may bear out these statements I\nhave asked them to sign the letter below. \/ri . T \u00ab -\u00bb\u00ab\n(Signed) J. C. Moore\nA. Moore\nP. Moore\"\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1934\nMr Besterman then inquired whether Mr Moore had had any\nreason to suppose that his friend might meet with an accident,\nas from weakness following his illness ; he also asked for inde-\npendent evidence of Mr Haughton's death. In reply, Mr Moore\nwrote as follows, in a letter dated 4 April 1934 :\n\" Mr Haughton had been working a lot of overtime, and this\ntold upon his nerves, which were not too strong after his having\nbeen buried with a shell in the war. In spite of that he was a jolly\nfellow, and the last man to have an accident of the kind. Even\nwhen I had my dream I could not believe that that would be his\nend.\nHe was 41 years of age. We used to swim and cycle together.\nHe was, in fact, getting better and was going to Southport for two\nweeks' final recuperation before returning to work. On the day of\nhis accident he had packed his bag for Southport, and was running\nup to the Doctor's to get some papers before he went away for the\nfortnight. I can only imagine that his mind was occupied when he\ncrossed the road. In fact, on such a road as New Chester Road\na man has to have his wits about him when crossing. Curiously\nenough, he had been round to the Doctor's the previous evening,\nbut the Doctor had been called out, and it was therefore necessary\nfor Mr Haughton to go again the following morning, which he did\nnot intend doing.\nAt the inquest a verdict of '\nAccidental death '\nwas returned.\"\nMr Moore also sent a copy of the issue of Port Sunlight News for\n11 January 1933, in which (p. 23) appears the following obituary\nnotice :\n\" 29th December, Cecil Maurice William Haughton, 126,\nNew Chester Road, Port Sunlight. Aged 41 years ;\nservice, 27\nyears. While away ill from business, suffering from neurasthenia,\nwas accidently killed on New Chester Road.\"\nIt will be seen that there is some slight discrepancy as to the date\nof the accident ; but there seems to be no doubt about the main\nfact that Mr Moore dreamed of his friend's death in a road accident\na few days before this actually occurred. The dangerous nature of\nthe road and the nervous illness of Mr Haughton certainly tend to\nsuggest a normal explanation. Nevertheless, the fairly close\napproximation in time of the dream and of the death remains note-\nworthy.\nVeridical Dream of a Present\nP. 304.\nIn a letter dated 15 March [1934] Mrs M. Feuerheerd, of Illereichen,\nPost Altenstadt in Schwaben, Bavaria, wrote as follows to Professor\nBroad, from 140 Westbourne Grove, London, W. 11 :\n\fJune 1934 Cases 251\n\"... Perhaps the following would interest you, which happened\nto me on Feb. 27th this year. I am staying with my mother whose\nbirthday was on Feb. 27. The evg. before, the postman brought a\nregistered parcel for her which I took in & signed for. This was\nput away for the next morning. That night I dreamt about the\nparcel & saw that an old-fashioned flat gold bracelet was taken out\nof it, of a byegone shape with little flat gold flowers on it. I was\nsurprised, as I had never seen such a bracelet. When I came to\nbreakfast the parcel was on the table still unpacked. I said to my\nmother\u2014I dreamt last night that an old-fashioned flat bracelet\nwas being sent in that parcel for you\u2014She opened the parcel &\ntook out the exact bracelet which I had dreamt about, a gold flat\none with small gold flowers on it. It is quite impossible to explain\nhow I should have known about the bracelet ; I had never seen it\nbefore.\nI may add that I have had a great many queer dreams in the last\nyears. ...\"\nMr Besterman wrote to ask for an independent statement from\nMrs Feuerheerd's mother, who wrote as follows from 140 West-\nbourne Grove, in a letter dated 24 March 1934, Mrs Feuerheerd\nhaving in the meanwhile returned to Germany :\n\" A small packet was brought to me by my daughter on Feb.\n26th which had just been delivered by the last post, 9 p.m. It\nwas not opened until next morning\u2014my birthday.\u2014As she came\ninto the room she said\n1\nI dreamt that I watched you open the\nparcel which came last evening & saw you take out an old-fashioned\nflat gold bracelet '. I then opened packet and much to our surprise\nfound its contents as she had described. She said it made her feel\nquite queer as the pattern of the bracelet in every detail was exactly\nwhat she had seen in her dream. Its former owner has been dead\nmany years & my daughter did not know of its existence.\n(Signed) Florence Shackleford \"\nThe most obvious explanation of this experience is clearly tele-\npathy, and the question therefore arises whether there exists any\nlink between the donor of the bracelet and the percipient. On this\npoint Mrs Shackleford writes, in reply to a question :\n\" I do not\nthink that my daughter's dream could be explained by telepathy\nas she knew very little of my friend who sent the bracelet & had\nnot seen her for over twenty years.\"\nA Collective Visual Hallucination\nG. 297.\nThe following letter was addressed to Professor CD. Broad. It\nis dated 27 March 1934, from 165 Deerpark Road, Cliftonville,\nBelfast\n:\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1934\n\". . . In the year 1920, 1 was serving in the Royal Navy\u2014my ship'\nwas based at Portland, Dorset. In consequence of being a married\nman I had a temporary home in that place for my wife and small\nbaby son.\nMy mother-in-law resided at Londonderry, Ireland, and when I\nwas given '\nLeave '\n\u2014both myself, wife and family frequently\nreturned to Londonderry to spend our holidays in her home. It\nwas during one of these visits that the following covenant was\ndrawn up between my wife's mother and I.\n'\nShould I die before her I would come back and visit her if\npossible '\n\u2014and the same was to apply in her case. \u2014This was agreed\nin my wife's presence.\nWe returned to Portland in due course and I quite forgot the\nincident, but the other partner to this strange agreement was in\nthe meanwhile unexpectedly called to the place of many '\nMansions\n'\nbut had not forgotten her part in the play of this strange drama.\nAbout six months after this incident, whilst the clocks were\nchiming the midnight hour, there appeared by the bedside occupied\nby my wife and myself the spiritual form of my wife's mother.\n\u2014\nShe looked beautiful in her Angelic state, as she stood there quite\nclose to Baby's cot, which was in close proximity to our bed. Her\nearthly stay only occupied a few seconds\u2014but quite long enough to\nconvince us that she had kept her promise.\nThis was witnessed by myself & wife simultaneously and ap-\nparently by Baby who gave a slight shout as if he was also aware\nof her presence.\nWe the undersigned are prepared to make an oath as to the\naccuracy of this statement. ,, T f-,\n,,\nJ\n(Signed) J.

Moore\nMarjorie Moore \"\nIn reply to questions addressed to them by Mr Besterman, Mr\nand Mrs Moore added in a letter dated 17 April 1934 that the name\nof Mrs Moore's mother was Annie Jane Elliot, that she died on\n21 December 1921 at Moss Cottage, Collan Lane, Londonderry,\nthat the date on which the apparition was seen was about March\n1922 and the address 22 Grove Road, Portland. Asked for a more\ndetailed description of the apparition Mr and Mrs Moore write in\nthe same letter :\n\" Her spirit appeared to be enveloped in a very\ntransparent mist, which acted as a shroud for the spirit body\u2014yet\ngiving a very clear outline. Her face shone with a heavenly ex-\npression\u2014beautiful indeed. We were too much taken by surprise\nto speak\u2014and her stay so short it did not afford us much time to-\ndo so.\"\nIt will be seen that there is here no question of telepathy, since\nthe apparition occurred when the death was already known to the\n\fJune 1934 Cases 253\npercipients. Nevertheless, any hallucination experienced by two,\nand possibly three, persons simultaneously, is sufficiently interesting\nto be worthy of record. The compact can be regarded as some\nevidence that the apparition may really have been due to some\nactivity on the part of the dead woman ; on the other hand it may\nequally well be regarded as a sufficient cause for a self-suggested\nhallucination.\n[From among interesting material received as a result of her\nrecent broadcast talk, and prepared by herself for future publica-\ntion, Mrs Salter very kindly allows the four following to appear in\nthe Journal together with her comments. All names and addresses\nare known, though not all may be printed :\n\u2014\nHon. Ed.]\nA Death-Coincidence\nL. 1303.\nMiss Margaret Jones, the percipient, wrote as follows :\n\" I have to go into details to explain the circumstances : I was\non night duty (as a professional nurse), which explains why I was\nasleep in the day-time. One evening, May 19, 1931, I was startled\nout of my sleep by a voice which called out my name distinctly,\n'Margaret, Margaret'. I felt positive that someone had been in\nmy room by my bed and rushed out again. I was never called by\nmy Christian name at the hospital ;\nhowever, I did not pay much\nattention to that, as I was asleep. I thought it must have been\nthe maid calling the night-nurses, and she had not switched my\nlight on. I got out of bed and looked down the corridor. I did not\nhear or see anybody. I looked at my clock ; it was 5.30 p.m. This\nwas quite early, as we were not called until 7.30 p.m. I sat up in\nbed, thinking over the strangeness of the situation. However, I\ndropped off to sleep again.\nAt breakfast that night I told some of my colleagues about my\nstrange experience and they just joked about it. I went on duty\nat 10.30 p.m. The night-sister came to me and called me to one\nside and asked me did I know anyone living at . I said, '\nYes,\nmy sister lives there '. '\nWell, Nurse,' she said, '\nI am afraid there is\nbad news for you '.\nShe handed me a telegram which said,\u2014\n'\nDarling Peggy passed away at 5.30 p.m.'. The telegram had been\nopened by Sister, as there were five Nurse Jones's in that particular\nhospital. Peggy was my little niece, age, eight years. We were\ngreat friends. She was taken suddenly ill and an immediate opera-\ntion was performed, but she only lived a few hours. When I met\nmy sister I told her what I had experienced and she told me that\nthe child called out '\nMargaret ', and. she remarked to her husband,\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June i\u00ab34\n'\nIs she calling herself, or Aunty Margaret ? '. It is a strange fact\nthat the stated time of the child's death on the wire was 5.30 p.m.,\njust about the time that I was disturbed from my sleep. I did not\nknow the child was ill ; it was very sudden. I cannot describe my\nfeelings as I read the telegram, which reminded me of my strange\nexperience at 5.30 p.m.\"\nThe following corroborative statement was sent by the child's\nmother :\n\" This is to certify that my husband and I were present at the\ndeath of my little daughter on May 19, 1931. It is true that she\ncalled out '\nMargaret ' and that at the time I remarked to my\nhusband, '\nIs she calling out her own name or Aunty's 1\n'\nand that\ntwo days afterwards I learnt from my sister that she had been dis-\nturbed from her sleep by a voice calling out Margaret (twice), and\nthat the same evening she received a telegram from us, informing\nher of the death of our child.\"\nOne of Miss Jones's colleagues, to whom, as stated above, she\nmentioned her experience at the time, has also sent a corroborative\nstatement, as follows :\n\" This is to certify I was present in May 1931 when Margaret\nJones related her dream with reference to her niece calling.\"\nA Death-Coincidence\nL. 1304.\nThe following case was sent to me immediately after my broad-\ncast talk on February 16th 1933, the experience having occurred\nduring the night of February 14th- 15th. The percipient, Mr\nBertram (pseudonym), wrote as follows :\n\" The following details of a dream I had on Thursday and its\nfulfilment may be worth recording :\nOn waking I could recall that I had been standing in a room\nwith a number of other people ; it seemed to be a social affair,\nalthough this impression was indefinite. Suddenly I saw an old\nman just in front of me ; we smiled at one another in recognition\nand at the same instant he dropped to the floor. He was literally\nin a heap, as it were,\u2014head, legs, arms at unnatural angles, all\nmixed up with his black clothes.\nAs he fell, I picked him up from the floor in one movement\nand put him over my shoulder, and as I did so, I had a feeling of\nterror. The body was featherweight and everything about it was\nloose and soft. I carried it to a seat and sat it beside me. Then the\nface looked at me again and smiled. The dream then faded, and\nI woke.\n\fJune 1934 Cases 255\nThe sequence of events detailed in the last two paragraphs was\nextraordinarily vivid and clear, standing out from the surroundings.\nThe central point was the fall of the old man and then my picking\nhim up quickly.\nI related all this to my family and told them that the old man\nof my dream appeared to me to be one of the directors of the firm\nwith whom I am employed, although I felt hazy on this point.\nThe whole thing made a great impression on me. I went to my\noffice as usual and again related my dream to a business friend. I\nfelt anxious\u2014my dream meant something, but I did not know what.\nI returned home and then received a message from a brother\nliving at C ,\nsaying that my father had collapsed and died\nearlier in the day at \u2014 - Home Hospital, where he had been lying\nfor over a year.\"\nIn reply to this statement I wrote to Mr Bertram asking whether\nhe could send me a corroborative statement from one of the people\nto whom he had mentioned his dream before he heard of his father's\ndeath, and also whether he had any reason to anticipate that the\ndeath might occur at that particular time. In reply to this second\nquestion Mr Bertram informed me that he had no reason to expect\nhis father's death at the time of his dream, as he had neither seen\nhim, nor had news of him for several months. His illness was of a\nchronic nature.\nIn reply to the first question, Mr Bertram sent a corroborative\nstatement from his wife, as follows :\n\" I have seen the letter sent to you and I certify that the parti-\nculars of my husband's dream were related to me by him on the\nmorning of 15th February 1934, about eight hours before we re-\nceived information from his brother that their father W. B. had\npassed away at the Home.\"\nWith regard to the interpretation of Mr Bertram's dream there\nare three points to which attention may be called : (1) it was evi-\ndently an unusually vivid dream and made a great impression on\nMr Bertram before he had any reason to consider it veridical ;\n(2) although he did not consciously realise in his dream that the\nold man was dead, his feeling of terror, when he lifted the body,\nsuggests that the idea of death may have been subconsciously\npresent in his mind ; (3) it is a commonplace of psycho-analytical\ninterpretation that the father is often concealed in dreams under\nthe symbol of some person in authority over the dreamer. This\nseems to me to increase the probability that Mr Bertram's dream\nabout an old man whom he identified (rather dubiously) with one\nof the directors of the firm by whom he is employed, was in fact a\ndream about his father.\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June l'jai\nj \u201e\u201eg A Death-Coincidence\nHere is another dream, almost as recent as the last, and also\nconnected with a death. Mr Taylor, the dreamer, wrote as follows :\n\" In 1912 I was '\nbest man '\nto a friend who has not seen much of\nme since, but I did know he was laid up with a severe cold. On\nSunday night last (the night between February 1 1 and February 12)\nI dreamt we met with a few other men at an open grave ; he turned\nto me and said, '\nI am going to be buried '\n; then after a short pause\nhe turned away and said, '\nNo, I would rather have my dinner '.\nThe dream then faded out. Next day I learnt that he had died\nabout twenty-four hours previous to my dream. I was astonished,\nbecause I had never dreamed of him before.\"\nI wrote to Mr Taylor putting three questions :\n(1) Could he give\nthe name of any person to whom he had mentioned his dream\neither before or immediately after hearing of his friend's death ?\n(2) How long before the dream had he heard of the illness and had\nhe any reason to think it was likely to be fatal ? (3) Would he in con-\nfidence give his friend's name? Mr Taylor wrote in reply, as follows :\n\" My dream occurred in the early hours of Monday (February\n12th). On going to town that morning I called at my brother's\noffice and before I had time to tell him anything, he remarked, '\nI\nsuppose you know that K\u2014 - is dead ', and I replied, '\nWell, that is\nremarkable. I was just going to tell you I dreamt of him last night '.\nThis was the first time I had mentioned the dream to anyone.\nMy brother had seen more of Mr K than I had of late years.\nHis illness was known to me perhaps a week or fortnight before he\npassed on. I don't remember thinking of him at all on the days\npreceding.\"\nI then wrote again to Mr Taylor, asking for his brother's corro-\nboration, and received in reply a statement from Mr W. C. Taylor\nto the effect that Mr Taylor had told him of his dream immediately\non his announcing the fact of Mr K 's death.\nThe evidential value of this case is to some extent weakened by\nthe fact that Mr Taylor knew of the illness ; on the other hand it\nseems clear from his statement that the matter was not at all on his\nmind. Moreover, the dream was perfectly definite and explicit, and\nit coincided closely in time with Mr K\u2014 -'s death.\n-j-\n~t ~> r f~*\nA Ca.se Coinciding with Illness\nL. 1.30b.\nMrs McCutcheon, the percipient, wrote as follows :\n\" I do not know what name to give it, but I have a gift of what\nI call '\nvision '. I describe things to my daughter before they come\n\fJunk 1934 Cases 257\nto pass, I get mental pictures, and I '\nfeel '.\nHere is a very good\nexample of what I mean. Last year on the 23rd of May at 2 o'clock\nin the morning I wakened suddenly as if someone had touched me\n(I sleep alone) and I saw a '\nvision '\nin my bedroom of what I took\nto be my brother who lives in Edinburgh lying very ill and low,\nlooking tremendously sad. In the morning I told my daughter\nabout it and I wrote down the date at the time, because I knew I\nwould hear about this later on. I heard after some time that my\nbrother in Edinburgh was well ;\nstill I knew I had not seen that\n'\nvision '\nfor nothing and decided to wait.\nMy brother from Canada arrived in July last year. He had\nnever been in the habit of writing to me, so that I knew nothing\nabout his circumstances. When I went to meet him at the boat.\nI noticed how ill he was. We got into conversation and it transpired\nthat he had been moved to hospital in Canada exactly on the 23rd\nof May. These '\nvisions '\nare not sometimes so clear as to correctly\ndistinguish faces, and as my brothers are much alike, I easily mis-\ntook one brother for the other.\"\nI wrote in reply to ask Mrs McCutcheon whether she could let\nme have corroborative statements from her daughter and her\nbrother ; I also asked whether it was in a diary that she had noted\nthe date of her vision. This was her reply :\n\" My brother is still with me and has enclosed to you a statement\nwhich will speak for itself. I have an out-of-date calendar at the\nside of my dining-room mantelpiece, on which I put addresses and\n'phone numbers at the back, so that I can quickly refer to them\nat a moment's notice. In the midst of all these jottings I have\nplainly written down '\n2 o'c in morning of 23rd May '.\nMany\naddresses were added since that morning I jotted down my vision\nand I still have the calendar hanging on the wall.\"\nWith this letter were enclosed statements from Mrs McCutcheon's\ndaughter and from her brother, as follows :\n(1)\n\" My mother has asked me to confirm her vision on 23rd\nMay 1933. In the morning when she came down to breakfast she\ntold me about it and she said she was going to take a note of it,,\nwhich she did in my presence.\"\n(2)\n\" My sister, Mrs. McCutcheon, has been corresponding with\nyou with regard to a vision she saw of me in Canada, when I was ill\nlast year, and you have asked her, I believe, to procure a statement\nfrom me regarding my mental state at the time. When I entered\nthe hospital on May 23, 1933, I was only thinking of my condition,\nmy health being very poor ; I was not thinking of any of my rela-\ntives, as I had no intention at that time of coming to this country.\"\n\f258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1934\nTaking into account the fact that in the part of Canada in which\nMrs McCutcheon's brother was living the time is about 7 hours\nbehind English time, 2 a.m. on May 23, 1933, in England was about\n9 p.m. on May 22, 1933, in Canada, that is, the evening before he\nwent to hospital. The weak point in this case is the confusion\nbetween the two brothers, but this seems to me just the kind of\nmistake which is likely to happen. The vision conveyed to Mrs.\nMcCutcheon the idea of a sick man, who was her brother, and her\nconscious mind misinterpreted it.\nTelepathy or Coincidence ?\nIn a letter dated 26 February 1934, Mrs M. Evans, Pakenham\nHouse, Edgbaston, Birmingham, wrote as follows to the President\n:\n\" In the summer of 1921, returning from a stay in Normandy, I\nwas waiting on the pier at Dieppe for my boat's departure. At the\nsame time my son was making his way down the west coast of France\non a business trip to Bordeaux, where he was due that same evening.\nMy friend and I were chatting, when suddenly I opened my note-\ncase and took out a fifty-franc note (worth at that time about\ntwenty-five shillings) and said, '\nI must post this to B. at Bordeaux '.\nMy friend tried to dissuade me ; there was no reason to think my\nson was short of funds, but I made for the nearest post-office, and\nregistered him the note. Almost at that identical time, having\ntaken out his note-case to buy his tickets, his movements were\nwatched, and when he got into the train, he found his pocket-book\nhad been stolen, he had only a few francs wherewith to arrive in a\nstrange town late on Friday evening, with no hope of getting funds\neven by wire till Monday or Tuesday. You can imagine his surprise\nat getting the registered letter from myself, first thing next morning.\nThe utter truth of this can be vouched for.\"\nAt Mr Besterman's request Mrs Evans kindly supplied the names\nand addresses of her son and of the friend referred to in her state-\nment. The latter did not reply to an inquiry, but Mr Burke A.\nEvans, c\/o Agard and Co. Ltd., Warwick Chambers, Birmingham,\nwrote as follows in a letter dated 25 March 1934 :\n\" In reply to your letter of March 20th I have pleasure in enclosing\nan account of the incident to which you refer.\nIn fairness, however, I must say that I have always regarded\nthe matter as a coincidence, albeit a fortunate one ; the circum-\nstances lend themselves fully as well to a material explanation as to\ntelepathic theory.\nIn support of the one you have the very natural circumstance of\n\fJune 1934 Cases 259\na lady, finding herself with a small sum in francs left over from her\nholiday, sending it on to her son in the same country ; for the other,\nyou have a boy in great distress of mind, possibly conveying a sense\nof need to a sympathic mind.\n(Signed) Burke A. Evans,\nB.Sc. (Birm.), M.Sc. (McGill).\"\nThe enclosed statement reads as follows :\n\" One afternoon in August 1921, upon arrival in Nantes, I dis-\ncovered that my pocket-book had been stolen on the journey, leaving\nme in a strange town with but a few francs. The house at home was\nclosed ;\nmy father was travelling in Switzerland, with address un-\ncertain ; and my mother would be crossing that afternoon from\nher holiday resort in Normandy and would be out of reach by wire\nfor two days.\nI was considerably worried and it was a great relief to receive\nthe next morning a 50 fr. note, from my mother, posted on the\nprevious afternoon from Dieppe ; it was accompanied by a short\nnote, saying that instead of changing the French money, she was\nsending it on to me.\nIt may be relevant to state that my mother and myself have\nalways been exceptionally sympathetic ; and that neither previously\nnor subsequently, have I received money from her in this way,\nexcept on the occasions of Christmas, birthday, etc.\"\nMr Burke Evans has very well stated the arguments for and\nagainst regarding this as a paranormal experience, and there is\nnothing to add to his observations.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nPrecognition.\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nMadam,\u2014Mr Saltmarsh's paper on Precognitions (Proc. xlii. 134)\nwhich gives a digest of fifty years' accumulation of evidence on one\nof the most important subjects on which Psychical Research is\nengaged, is a document which should surely receive a very thorough\ndiscussion at the hands of leading members of the Society, especially\nof those who realise how far-reaching from a philosophical point\nof view is any evidence bearing on the question of the nature of\nTime. It might have been hoped that a careful and comprehensive\ncriticism would have been put forward, if not of the whole mass of\nthe evidence, at least of the best and most typical cases : and if a\ndiscussion of Mr Saltmarsh's theory is out of place in the Journal of\n\f260 Correspondence Junk I !)34\nsuch, a Society as ours, a criticism of thefacts would at any rate have\ngiven the generality of members an idea of what the evidence may\nfairly be considered to have established. One might have hoped to\ndiscover from this whether we are in a position to say that there are\ncases on actual record for which no explanation other than pre-\ncognition can be reasonably put forward.\nBut as such a general criticism does not seem to have been\nprovoked, may an indistinguished member of the Society be\npermitted to ask one or two pertinent questions ?\n( 1 ) Is anyone prepared to put forward a theory (or theories)\nalternative to that of genuine precognition which will apply to, say,\nthe group of cases quoted on pp. 60-63 of Mr Saltmarsh's report ?\n(2) Does anyone think, in view of the evidence of the whole 281\ncases here collected, that prevision is less likely to be a fact than not\nto be a fact ?\nAttention seems to have been concentrated so far on a single\ncase, viz. the \" monkey \" case, with the result that the main issue\nhas been obscured. Professor Dodds has suggested that the\nFreudian view of dreams increases the probability that any given\ndream will be fulfilled by chance, because dreams do not take place\nat random but are apt to follow selected routes along certain lines\nof symbolism. Even granting that allowance must be made for\nthis in estimating the chance-factor, I suggest that the principle is\nirrelevant in many of the cases, particularly in those dreams which\nwere fulfilled in detail. Take for example case P. xi. 577\u2014a dream\nthree times repeated. What bearing has any theory of dreams on\nthis case and on the other cases like it ? A concatenation of details\nis dreamed and these details afterwards occur. The only question\nto be decided (provided the story be accepted as true) is whether\nthe coincidence between the dream and the incidents which after-\nwards occurred was due to chance or not. Whether we can trace\nsymbolism, or indeed what psychological dream-processes were\ninvolved, does not matter in the least : it is totally irrelevant.\nIt would be of real interest to know, even in the case of this single\nexample, (1) how many critics believe that this dream, as reported,\nnever occurred, (2) how many believe that the dream did occur\nas reported, but that its fulfilment was due to chance, (3) how many\nbelieve that it did occur and that it was a genuine case of pre-\ncognition. I venture to think that an outspoken expression of\nopinion by experienced members of the Society on such points as\nthese would be of immense value, for it would give to everybody\ninterested in the Society's work a gauge of what has been achieved\nduring fifty years on one of the main issues\u2014possibly even the\nmost important issue\u2014on which psychical research is engaged :\nthat is to say, whether or not a ray of light of an empirical kind\n\fJune 1934 Correspondence 261\nhas been shed on that group of central problems which cluster round\nthe meanings of such words as \" existence,\" \" becoming,\" \" the\nactual,\" '.'\nthe potential \" and the like.\nPrecognition does no doubt seem a bizarre suggestion when set\nin the context of the common-sense world ; but we cannot too often\nremind ourselves that in the realm of speculative thought, no sober\nworld of common sense exists. That comfortable refuge was\ndestroyed long ago by the philosophers ; and I think it is safe to say\nthat the problem of Time has already been rendered so paradoxical\nand obscure by the different schools of philosophical thought that\nprecognition, even if proved, would add but little to the bizarre\nnature of the situation which already exists. We have to bear in\nmind that the problems presented by normal sense-perception lead\nlogically to situations which are not a whit less otitre and extra-\nordinary than the so-called \" supernormal \" problems of clair-\nvoyance and telepathy. As Mr Bertrand Russell once remarked :\n\" Common sense leaves us completely in the dark as to the true\nintrinsic nature of physical objects. . . . The truth about physical\nobjects must be strange. It may be unattainable, but if any\nphilosopher believes that he has attained it, the fact that what he\noffers as the truth is strange ought not to be made a ground of\nobjection to his opinion.\"\nIs it too much to hope that some members of this Society who\nthink that the evidence collected in Mr Saltmarsh's paper has\nbrought to light cases which cannot reasonably be explained except\non the hypothesis of precognition will candidly say so : and, on the\nother hand, that some of those who think that all these cases can\nmore reasonably be explained on alternative hypotheses will\ndemonstrate their view ? Otherwise it looks as if much of the\ncareful work of our predecessors would be left in the lumber-room.\nYours, etc.,\nG. N. W.

Nevertheless, the narrator being clearly a good\nwitness and the incidents of much interest, they should, we think,\nbe placed on record.\nIn a letter dated 23 February 1934, Mr Arnold G. Hansard, Hel-\nford, Luscombe Road, Parkstone, Dorset, wrote to the President\nas follows :\n\" I was much interested in your broadcast on telepathy : and I\nthink that the following experience may interest you and is worth\nrecording : the explanation of the actions of my wife seems to be\ndue to some kind of telepathy.\nMy wife has been subject to '\nsleep-walking '\nfrom time to time\nfor many years. The following incidents took place in Nairobi.\nOn account of her sleep-walking I have made it a rule to lock\nthe outer doors and put the keys away where I thought she would\nbe unable to find them.\nExpce. 1 . There were 3 keys to doors leading out of the bungalow.\nBefore going to bed I hid these keys and from time to time changed\nthe place of hiding. One night I was just coming from my bath\n\u2014my wife having gone to bed a little previously\u2014when I heard\nthe door from the dining-room on to the verandah close , and hasten-\ning out was just in time to catch her walking out fast asleep. I had\nhidden the keys under a writing pad, which lay on the writing\ntable. I did not wake her up\u2014but next day she told me that she\ndreamt I had told her that she would find the keys under the writing\npad (and that the right hand one was the key of the dining-room\ndoor. This last statement is very difficult to understand\u2014because\nactually I put the keys down at random, and had to examine them\nin the morning to tell which was which before replacing them :\nsee No. 4).\n2. In a different bungalow I had hidden the two keys, one in\nthe dining-room under a gramophone and the other on the top of\nsome books in a book-case in the back-passage. This time I had\nnot gone to bed and I saw her come into the dining-room and go\nstraight to the gramophone table and take the key and go with it\nto the door on to the verandah. I took the key out of her hand\nas she was putting [it] into the door : this seemed to puzzle her,\nbut she went straight into the passage, felt along the top of the\nbooks and found the back-door key, then I led her back to bed.\nNext morning she again told me that she had dreamt I told her\nwhere to find the keys.\nb2\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 19:h\n3. In the same bungalow as (2) I had adopted as a hiding place\na brass^pot shaped like a large glass tumbler which contained a\nnumber of porcupine quills. I used to think as I put them in '\nshe\nwill never go feeling for them here, as she would prick her hands\non the quills !\n'\nOne night I found she had got out of the house\nand found her about 200 yds away ! I got her back without waking\nher : and next morning she told me she dreamt I told her she\nwould find the keys in the pot with the porcupine quills '\nand mind\nyou don't prick your fingers '\n!\nSince then I have always placed the keys under the mattress\nof our bed so that she would have to disturb me to get them\n\u2014\nshe\nhas never tried to get them.\n4. This experience has no telepathic interest, but seems to\nhave some bearing on her knowing the right key in (1) and thinking\nthat I had told her which it was (which otherwise I should have\nthought was mere coincidence). When we came to this house,\nI used to take the front and back door keys away, and one night\njust as I was coming from my bath I heard my wife on the stairs :\ncoming to her I found her in great distress : she had gone out\nasleep into the road, had scared a passer by who screamed and woke\nher up. She told me she had dreamed that I had told her that\nthe key of the door from the kitchen into the scullery would open the\nback door. Now altho this proved to be quite true I was quite\nunaware of it, and the keys were apparently quite unlike\u2014the\nkitchen key being a little short one and the back door a long one.\nSo here as in ( 1 ) she seems to have in some way received knowledge\nabout the keys and wrongly attributed it to my information.\nI am afraid I have made a very long letter about a small matter.\nBut I think that (1), (2) and (3) are really good cases of telepathy\n\u2014because I would always be thinking about my wife when hiding\nthe keys, and there has always been very close mental intimacy\nbetween us.\"\nMr Besterman put a series of questions to Mr Hansard in regard\nto the following points : (1) Was it at all possible for Mrs Hansard\nto have seen or to have heard him hiding the keys ? (2) Could he\nhave unconsciously given the information by talking in his sleep ?\n(3) What were the dates of the incidents described and the ad-\ndresses where they occurred ? Mr Hansard very kindly answered\nthese questions in letters dated 18 and 23 March and 10 and 26 April,\nfrom which the following extracts are taken :\n\" As the object of hiding the keys was to prevent any chance of\nmy wife finding them I always took the greatest care, hiding them\nafter she had gone to the bedroom, and collecting them in the\n\fJuly 1934 Telepathy and Sleep-walking 267\nmorning before she got up. I can say positively that in none of\nthe cases described could she have possibly obtained knowledge\nof the hiding places in the normal way.\"\n\" The possibility of my wife's hearing where I hid the keys was\nalways in my mind when hiding them\u2014of course it would have\nbeen unconscious observation on her part because she was as anxious\nas I was to be protected from the danger of her sleep-walking.\nYou will realise my anxiety when I tell you that once I found her\na good 200 yards from our house just where our private track\nacross the veldt joined one of the main roads into Nairobi\u2014where\nshe might easily have been run down by a car, or even attacked\nby wild animals ! (This was I believe on the '\nporcupine quill\n'\noccasion.) I even had to go to the trouble of putting iron bars\non all the windows of at least three houses we lived in to prevent\nthe possibility of her getting thro them.\"\n\" Case (1).

Two or three sets of a hundred or so trials, from a given\nindividual, are therefore unlikely to be useful and volunteers should\naccordingly be prepared to continue their efforts over a period of\nsome weeks, working a set of 120 guesses either daily or as near this\nas is practicable.\nI shall be most grateful if those interested will write to me at\nCalandstraat 64, Rotterdam.\nI am, etc.,\nWhately Carington.\nREVIEW\nJ. W. Dunne, An Experiment with Time. Pp. 288. Faber and\nFaber, Ltd. Price 5s. net.\nThe first edition of this book was reviewed by Mr S. G. Soal in the\nJournal in 1927,1\nand with regard to the main portions of the present\nvolume there remains little to add to what was then said. The\nauthor introduces his subject by recounting some eight precognitive\ndreams of a vivid and interesting kind which were experienced by\nhim at intervals and afterwards fulfilled in considerable detail.\nThese suggested to him the idea of experimenting with his ordinary\ndreams, recording them at the moment of waking and carefully\nx\nSee Journal, xxiv. 119.\n\fJuly 1U34 Review 27]\nwatching subsequent events for the emergence of possible pre-\ncognitive details ; and the next section of the book goes on to\ndescribe these experiments and the successes which the author\nclaims to have attained with his own dreams and those of his friends.\nSome thirteen examples of such successes are quoted, but they are\nnot corroborated or given with sufficient accuracy of detail to\nconstitute first class evidence. This fact is a disappointment to the\nreader whose interest has been stimulated, and it is still more dis-\nconcerting to be told on pp. 58 and 91 that\nLi\nthese records are not\nevidence, or intended to be regarded as such\". The value of the\nbook is thereby reduced and the author's position seriously weakened.\nMr Dunne's experiences led him to believe that precognition is an\nelement in all normal dreaming, and he wished to try a larger-scale\nexperiment in order to test this theory. With this in view he\napproached the S.P.R., and after considerable correspondence a\nseries of experiments was carried out in 1932 in which 20 members\nof the S.P.R. sent in a total of 265 dreams to be analysed for pre-\ncognition. 1\nThese experiments are not mentioned in the author's\nbook as the result was disappointing, only two dreams showing\nevidence of what was sought for. Mr Dunne then suggested that\nyounger subjects should be tried, and an experiment was jointly\norganised by himself and the S.P.R. in which 22 Oxford under-\ngraduates acted as the subjects. Their dreams, noted and examined\nin accordance with careful instructions, were forwarded to the\nS.P.R. by Mr H. H. Price, Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and\nLecturer in Philosophy. Mr Dunne added to these cases 17 dreams\nof his own, and in his present book he deals with the Oxford results\nand his own in one group. An independent report of these experi-\nments will be found in Proc. S.P.R. XLI, 195.\nWhen considering the section of the book which deals with these\ncollective experiments, the reader should bear several points in\nmind. In the first place the author has approached his problem\nfrom a peculiar point of view. He has been mainly concerned to\nprove that precognition is a \" normal \" and not a \" supernormal\n\"\nphenomenon, and he has dealt with the results in such a way as to\nmake this point appear. The treatment is in fact such that the\nincautious reader may be easily misled. The contrast between\n\" supernormal \" and \" normal \" would seem to be in point of fact\nmore verbal than real. Most thinking people now recognise that\nthe faculties of sensitives differ from those of ordinary people in\ndegree rather than in kind, so that \" supernormal \" would seem to\nmean no more than \" uncommon \". But Mr Dunne regards the\ndifference as vital, and this view colours his attitude towards the\nwhole subject.\n1\nSee Proceedings, sli. 18(3.\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1934\nSecondly, the author believes, in pursuance of this view, that\ndream-incidents must be drawn about equally from actual past and\nfuture events, and his table of results on p. 280 is drawn up solely\nwith a view to demonstrating this theory, some of the dreams being\nselected because they refer to past events alone. Now the question\nof the correspondence of dreams with past events opens a difficult\nproblem. Numbers of dreams are undoubtedly based on 'memories\nof past events, but it is a question whether or not there is a class of\ndreams which reach directly back to past events themselves. If there\nis, this class alone would be the genuine counterpart of precognitive\ndreams, and until this difficult point has been cleared up, figures on\nthe subject are not much use.\nA third point is that these experiments do not only test the pre-\ncognitive faculties of the subjects but test their power of capturing\ntheir dreams and noting correspondences at the same time. If the\nlatter powers are weak, they may mask cases of genuine pre-\ncognition.\nAgain, whether mediocre cases should be put down to precognition\nor to chance is a matter of personal judgment, and this is a very\nvariable quantity. Hence the final figures can only be regarded as\na rough guide. Unfortunately many people are unduly impressed\nby statistical tables merely on account of their business-like air.\nThe author gives a rule for making such judgments which seems to\nbe quite a fair one. Suppose the waking event in question had\noccurred before the dream instead of after it ; would you then have\nlinked the dream causally with the event ? If so, it must be counted\nas precognitive : a priori ideas about causality must not be allowed\nto influence the judgment.\nAt the end of the book Mr Dunne summarises the Oxford group\nexperiments together with his own, the experiments in all com-\nprising 165 records, 148 of which were sent in by 22 Oxford under-\ngraduates and 17 by the author himself. His statistical summary of\nthese on p. 280 is most peculiar and misleading. He has given\ndescriptions of 48 of the dreams, but in tabulating the results he has\nignored 16 of the participating subjects altogether and has quoted\nthe total of the dreams as 88 provided by the remaining 7 subjects.\nFrom this total of 88 he has taken 34, 14 of which he classifies as\nreferring to the past and 20 to the future. This arbitrary mode of\nprocedure is designed to show that the successful dreams contain\nreferences to past and future events in more or less equal proportions,\nand hence to vindicate his theory about the content of dreams. But\nthe difficulty of dealing with dreams referring to the past has already\nbeen mentioned, and with regard to the 20 which refer to the future,\nit is evident that if we use these results to estimate what proportion\nof the total contain precognition we shall be seriously misled. They\n\fJuly 1934 Review 273\nmust be referred to the total of 165, and not to the author's arbitrary\ntotal of 88. The percentage of precognitive dreams is then about\n12 per cent as against 22.7 per cent according to the author's\nfigures. This lack of scientific accuracy is a characteristic feature of\nthe whole book.\nSince the author attaches great importance to his theory of pre-\ncognition it is necessary to mention it here. Mr Soal in his review\nof the earlier edition has pointed out a flaw in the geometrical\nscheme ; but the theory appears also to rest on a radical mis-\nconception of a philosophical kind. The author adopts from Physics\nthe conception of a four-dimensional Space-time continuum, and his\nwhole theory is based upon the assumption that a human observer\nis in some way able to travel in a literal sense along the fourth or\nTime-dimension. Now this travelling is Space-travelling, for the\nauthor makes it literally a motion ; so that the question arises as to\nwhat it is which travels and gives rise to the appearance of a flux of\ntemporal events. In his diagrams the author makes his traveller a\nplane or diaphragm which moves along the Time-dimension ; but\nobviously this moving plane must be related in some way to the\nobserver's consciousness, since it is to consciousness that events\nappear as a flux ; and it is the nature of this relationship which is the\ncrux of the whole theory.\nAnything which can travel in Space must necessarily be capable\nof standing in spatial relations and of changing these relations ; but\nthe observer's perceptual consciousness does not fulfil these con-\nditions. It cannot stand in spatial relation to anything. Faced\nwith this difficulty, the author has fallen into dire confusion. He\nhas first confused the observer's consciousness with his \" field of\npresentation \", and has then gone on to state that the two together\nare spatially coincident with the observer's brain !\n\" According to\nthe theory of psychoneural parallelism \", he says, \" it [the '\nfield of\npresentation '] occupies the same spatial position as does that\nportion of the observer's cerebrum which is in the state of apparent\nactivity associated with the production of observable psychical\nphenomena \" (p. 163). By \" field of presentation \" Mr Dunne\nobviously means here what is known in philosophy as a \" sense-\nfield \". Now the relation of extended sense-data and of sense-fields\nto physical space is a difficult point in the theory of Perception,\nwhich cannot be entered into here : but it must be abundantly\nevident that the sense-field belonging to a sentient cannot be\nspatially coincident with his own brain ! And the theory would\nseem to collapse on this initial confusion.\nIn its later stages the theory enriches the universe with Time-\ndimension after Time-dimension, each of which, as soon as it is\nadded, turns into a dimension of Space. Along these the indefati-\n\f274: Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1934\ngable \" observer \" pursues his way, at each stage demanding a new\nTime to travel in. In the end, the external world becomes an\ninfinitely complicated geometrical regress with the problem of Time\nas much unsolved at the end as it was at the beginning.\nApart however from the theory, students of psychical research\nshould be glad to find someone ready to spend time and energy on a\nsubject so generally neglected, yet one which is unescapable if we\nare to attain either a thorough understanding of this world or a\nrational conception of another.\nG.

Thomas read a paper on \" The Fire Walk \", which\nwill, it is hoped, be published later in the Proceedings.\nThe 131st Private Meeting of the Society was held at 31 Tavistock\nSquare on Wednesday, 25 July 1934, at 5.30 p.m., The Rev. C.\nDrayton Thomas in the Chair.\nA paper by Dr Carl Bruck on \" Experiences in Reciprocal\nTelepathy \" was read by Mr W. H. Salter.\nMr Salter prefaced Dr Brack's Paper with a reminder that Dr\nBrack, who practised as a Doctor in Berlin, had in 1922-1923\ncarried out a series of experiments with a small group of percipients,\nsometimes under hypnosis, sometimes not. The results of these\nexperiments had been recorded in a book (Experimentelle Telepathie)\npublished in 1925, and reviewed by Dr Schiller in Proceedings.\nLater Dr Brack had conceived of the valuable idea of keeping a\ndiary of occurrences in his own household which seemed to him to\nindicate the possible presence of some paragnostic element. The\noccurrences were mostly correspondences of idea and expression\nbetween himself and his housekeeper, a country-woman of no very\nhigh education. The paper recorded thirty such correspondences,\nmany of which Dr Bruck frankly admitted were not far outside the\nrange of chance-coincidence. One of his points in fact was that some\nfactor in the external situation stimulated the exercise of telepathic\nfaculties, so that the resulting compound was not wholly fortuitous,\nnor wholly telepathic. In the concluding section of the paper Dr\nBrack lent the weight of his opinion against the belief in a corporeal\nlocalisation of a parapsychical receiving or transmitting organ.\nAt both meetings an interesting discussion followed the paper.\nOBITUARY\nArthur Prince Chattock, Emeritus Professor of Physics in the\nUniversity of Bristol, died on 1 July last in his 74th year. He\nbecame an Associate of the Society in 1890, eight years after its\nfoundation, a Life Associate in 1898 and a Life Member in 1905.\nHis record as an experimental physicist has recently been outlined\nin the columns of Nature, and a full account of his work on that\nsubject will shortly appear in an obituary notice in the Proceedings\nof the Royal Society.\n\fOctober 1934 Obituary 279\nSuffice it to say here that his work was that of a real pioneer,\nembracing important advances in electrical discharge phenomena,'\nmagnetism and the measurement of minute pressure differences.'\nHe was from the first interested in telepathy. It appeared to him\nas a new mode of communication between observers, and as such a\nphenomenon which was exciting whether propagation took place by\nsome type of electromagnetic wave falling directly under the realm\nof physics, or whether it could be traced to an entirely different\nagency. He formed one of a band of professional scientists, including\nsome physicists, who felt strongly that the difficulties of the work\nor the possibilities of failure should not deter scientific men from\nattempting to elucidate psychic phenomena.\nAfter many tests he found, to his regret, that he himself did not\npossess any special telepathic powers. But he stimulated a number\nof his students to experiment with him on simple thought trans-\nference or the ouija board. One set of observations initiated in this\nway by him is recorded in the Journal of the Society (Vol. VIII, p. 302,\n1898) and one by Usher and Burt in the Annals of Psychical Science\nVol. VIII (1909), p. 561.\nOn several occasions in his earlier days when prejudice against\nthese phenomena was rife, he took up cudgels in public lectures on\nbehalf of the activities of the Society, and he also showed a practical\ninterest m its work by frequent donations to the general fund.\nHe will be remembered by a generation of students as a brilliant\nteacher, and by all who knew him as a man who invariably placed\nthe interests of others before his own.\nThough his extreme modesty and retirement led him to shun\nformal scientific and social gatherings, admission to an inner circle\nrevealed a rare and engaging personality of simple tastes, wide\nculture and great liberality of thought.\nHe was a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers a\nDoctor of Science of the University of Bristol honoris causa, and a\n.bellow of the Royal Society. He was married in 1906, and his wife\nsurvives him.\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1934\nREPORT OF A PICTURE-TEST OBTAINED ON\n21 SEPTEMBER 1933\nBy the Rev. W. S. Irving\nIntroductory Note\n:\nIn order that chance coincidence in picture-tests might as far as\npossible be eliminated, it was suggested to me by Mrs Salter that I\nshould ask my Communicator if she would try to always get her\npicture-tests from the same newspaper, instead of from many various\nsources.\nOn 18 September 1933, therefore, during the Personal Control, I\ntold Dora of this suggestion, and asked her to try always to get tests\nfrom next day's London Evening News, to eliminate chance. Dora\nreplied, \" Yes, dear, but I have taken them from that \". This would\nseem to be true as regards several of her tests. \" Stick to the one,\"\nI replied, and she said that she would try to do so. In view of the\nfact that the following tests, which were given three days later, were\nnot from the London Evening News, but were found in the Daily\nMail, I must mention, that, when in town, I generally see three daily\npapers, the Daily Express, the Daily Mail, and the London Evening\nNews. The two latter, I buy regularly.\nExtractfrom a sitting with Mrs Leonard on Thursday, 21 Septem-\nber 1933, about 11 a.m. Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Re-\ncorder : Miss E. M. Horsell.\n[Feda].

H. Salter\nThe fact that the relevant pictures were not found in the Evening\nNews, as had been suggested, but in the Daily Mail, one of three\npapers Mr Irving sees when in London, obviously increases the\nopportunity for chance-coincidence, and it seemed to me desirable\nto form some kind of estimate of what results chance was likely to\ngive. Mr Irving procured for me twelve issues of the Daily Mail\nfrom 19 October to 1 November inclusive. The picture page at the\nback of each of these (afterwards called the experimental pages) have\nbeen carefully compared with the statements at the sitting and with\nthe test-page. I give below the conclusions I should draw from this\ncomparison.\n(1 )\nBy far the best single point given at the sitting is the reference\nto a figure lying down on the ground with the knees up and the head\ntwisted a little. This was accurately and conspicuously fulfilled on\nthe test-page, the only mistake made being as to the sex of the\nfigure, which, as Mr Irving points out, is not immediately obvious\n(see sketch plan). I found nothing in any way corresponding to this\non any of the experimental pages.\n(2) The reference to a fruit-tree, given also as \" fruit \" and \" a\ntree \" is better fulfilled on the test-page than elsewhere, for there we\nhave an actual drawing of a tree coupled with the words \" cherry-\nblossom \" which suggest a fruit-tree. On the back page of the issue\nof 28 October there was another advertisement of Cherry Blossom\nBoot-Polish, but it included no drawing of a tree ; several issues had\npictures which included trees and advertisements which included\nreferences to fruit, but nowhere else were these two things conjoined.\n(3) The reference to liquid is well-fulfilled on the test-page, but\nunfortunately Feda weakened this point by suggesting that verifica-\ntion might be found in some reference to water, \" lake \", \" river \",\nor \" sea \". In no fewer than ten of the twelve experimental pages I\nfound something that could be described as a reference to liquid in\nthe wide sense admitted by Feda. I conclude therefore that no\nevidential value attaches to this point.\n(4)\n\" Nautical allusions \" and \" the sea \" are also of frequent\noccurrence. I found them on eight of the twelve experimental pages.\nBut in only one of these eight cases was the picture coupled with\nanything that could be regarded as a forecast, something that\n\" could or would most probably happen \". It is therefore to these\nwords only that any evidential value can be given in this part of the\ntest.\n\fOctober 1934 An Experimental Test 285\n(5) The allusion to an arch is well-furnished on the test-page (see\nsketch plan), but here again Feda weakened her case by adding the\nwords \" or bridge-way \". Only one of the experimental pages has\nan arch corresponding in shape to the curve described by Feda, but\ntwo others have bridge-ways.\n(6) The reference to flags is well fulfilled on the test-page, but\nflags, partly for their decorative value, and partly on account of\ntheir connexion with ships appear to be a fairly frequent subject of\nnewspaper pictures. I found them on three of the twelve experi-\nmental pages.\nFor purposes of comparison I adopted a system of marking based\non what might be called the scarcity-value of the various statements\nmade at the sitting, as follows :\nSome one lying down - - 5\nKnees up------ -2\nFruit-tree - -4\nArch or bridge-way - -4\nFlags ------ . 3\nConsequences ------- 3\nIt should be clearly understood that these marks are only a rough\nestimate ; for accurate results one would need to work with a much\nlarger amount of material.\nTotal score for sitting : 5x2 x4x4x3 x3 = 1440.\nI do not think it necessary to give in detail the marks obtained\nby the experimental pages ; the only result running into double\nfigures was obtained on 25 October, namely 24. There is, therefore,\na prima facie case for supposing that the relation between the state-\nments made at the sitting of 21 September 1933 and the illustration\nappearing on the back page of the Daily Mail is due to something\nmore than chance.\nWe also obtained through the courtesy of the Editorial Depart-\nment of the Daily Mail a statement as to the time of day on 21 Sep-\ntember 1933 when the various items appearing on the picture page\nof 22 September were chosen. It appears from this statement that\nthe photograph of the launching of the lifeboat was taken at about\n3.15 p.m. ;\nthe final selection of the various relevant items appear-\ning on the page was made at various times between 6 and 7.30\np.m. The relevant part of Mr. Irving's sitting, as appears from his\nrecord, took place between 11 and 11.30 a.m. on 21 September 1933.\n[We hope shortly to print two more tests of the same type. Hon.\nEd.]\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October it*34\nCORRESPONDENCE\nExperiments in Precognition\nMadam.\u2014 A number of Members volunteered to help in the experi-\nments referred to in my letter appearing in the July Journal (p. 270),\nand the outcome so far is distinctly encouraging. The present indi-\ncations, however, are to the effect that a greater number of partici-\npants, rather than intensive work by individuals, will be necessary\nin order to obtain significant results.\nI accordingly venture to repeat my appeal for volunteers, with\nthe encouragement that a somewhat smaller number of trials will be\nneeded in each case than was at first expected.\nMy address is, Calandstraat 64, Rotterdam, Holland.\nI am, etc.,\nWhately Carington.\nThe Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities\nMadam,\u2014In my recent paper on this subject (Proc. S.P.R. Part 136)\nI adopted the view (e.g., in sections 4 and 33) that the finding of\nsignificant differences as regards reaction times or reproduction test\nbetween two personalities was to be taken as positive evidence of\ntheir not possessing a common subconscious and, therefore, of their\n\" autonomy \".\nThis view was t ased partly on the stress laid by Jung and others\non the importance of the part played by unconscious factors in\ndetermining these reactions, and partly on the work of Prince and\nPeterson with the psychogalvanic reflex in the BCA case, taken in\nconjunction with the known correlation between reflex and reaction\ntime in certain respects.\nA recent experiment by MM. Besterman and Gatty shows, how-\never, that this conclusion is almost certainly erroneous. Mr Gatty\nacted as subject and, by merely adopting two different \" orienta-\ntions \" of mind alternately (and without, of course, any question of\nintervention ab extra arising) found he could produce differences\nbetween the two states, as regards both reaction times and repro-\nduction, of the same order as those I found in the analysis of Mrs\nGarrett and Uvani and of the Leonard-Feda-Thomas group. Full\ndetails will be reported in due course.\nThe result of this experiment does not, of course, account for the\nvery remarkable phenomenon of the apparent \" centrality \" or\n\" dominance \" of John, nor does it destroy any claim to autonomy\nthat might be advanced on other grounds, as would be the case, I\nthink, if I had found similarities where I actually found differences.\n\fOctober 1934 Gorresjpo n dence 287\nBut it does make it illegitimate to argue that the personalities con-\ncerned must be autonomous because they give significantly different\nsets of reaction times or reproductions.\nI am, etc.,\nWhately Carington.\nIntensive Investigation of Telepathy\nMadame,\u2014I have just read Professor Dodds' article in the May\nissue of the Proceedings of the S.P.R., a superbly concise piece of\nargument which, I venture to think, demolishes the case for spiri-\ntualism so far as is humanly possible. May I suggest that it leaves\nthe S.P.R. with the duty now of conducting an intensive investiga-\ntion of telepathy ? It may be that the telepathic explanation of\nmediumistic communications will some day prove to be as scientifi-\ncally groundless a hypothesis as spiritualism : I don't think so,\nbecause I cannot see the alternative, though, just possibly, the\nnotion of hyper-aesthesia (curiously exemplified by Professor\nGilbert Murray's supposed inability to reveal a subject suggested to\nhim by people in another room unless they at least whisper it to each\nother) may be a clue. In any case, while I should not want the\nS.P.R. to abandon all work in other directions, I do definitely hope\nthat it will now turn its main attention to investigating the tele-\npathic hypothesis and the phenomena which appear to be related\nto this.\nYours.\nC. E. Bechhofer Roberts.\n[Most of our readers, though they may not concur in Mr Bechhofer\nRoberts' conclusion that the case for spiritualism is humanly\nspeaking demolished, will probably agree with him as to the im-\nportance of studying telepathy.\nWe may, however, remind Mr Roberts that ever since its founda-\ntion the S.P.R. has constantly pursued this line of enquiry, and it is\npossibly easier to suggest that an \" intensive investigation \" is\ndesirable than to carry one out ! But if Mr Bechhofer Roberts, or\nany other of our Members, has suggestions to make, we will gladly\nconsider them. Hon. Ed.]\nBelief in Survival\nMadam,\u2014Professor Dodds' most able, interesting, and valuable\npaper (Proc. Part 135) entitled \" Why I do not believe in Survival\n\"\nhas not affected my own belief in it, mainly because his treatment of\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1934\nthe cross-correspondence evidence is not only (admittedly) super-\nficial, but (unintentionally) misleading : the strong points are not\ngiven. Further, some very significant elements of evidence pointing\nto survival appeared in experiments and episodes shortly afterwards,\nand these Professor Dodds does not consider.\nThe chipping of a large collection of flints, collected from a sea-\nshore, might be dismissed by a geologist as the result of purely\nnatural operations\u2014the pounding and battering they had undergone\nfrom rocks and pebbles under wave action. A general but most\nrational and straightforward explanation. Yet a connoisseur might\npick out a small percentage of them which showed such strong\nevidence of purpose and intelligence in the chipping as to point to\ntheir being artifacts, putting the geologist's generalisation out of\ncourt.\nProfessor Pigou truly in 1909 pointed out the complementariness\nin the Verrall experiment (p. 168). But it was an experiment, inten-\ntionally and consciously tried, as Sir Oliver Lodge pointed out at the\ntime. This applies also to the Murray incident mentioned.\nSuch a note, in a script, as \" seek elsewhere for this \"\n(p. 168),\nseems to show a consciousness of the cross-correspondence idea.\nIf the scribe was ignorant of the scheme we must posit an experi-\nment deliberately planned if not \" consciously \" carried out by Mrs\nVerrall's subconsciousness. Mrs Holland's remarkable \" There\nshould be ... if possible seven\u2014the lady and the learned lady\nand the maiden of the crystal and the scribe and the professed scribe\n\u2014and the two newcomers ...\" would be a further example of this\noperation, and Mrs Willett's dramatic \" who selects friend Pidding-\nton . . . who selects ?\n\" another.\nThen there is the Lethe incident with its suggestion, deliberately\nmade, that Mr Dorr was mistaken in thinking that the communi-\ncator was unaware of the obvious connotation of \" Lethe \".\nClearly on this hypothesis the subconsciousness is capable de tout,\nand all will agree that, if it is well-founded, Jeremiah spoke truer\nthan he knew when he said \" the heart is deceitful above all things\nand desperately wicked : who can know it \".\nYours, etc.,\nPitt Rivers Museum, Oxford. Ernest S. Thomas.\nThe Word Association Test in the Garrett-Uvani Mediumship\nMadam,\u2014Jf I may be permitted, I should like to make a comment\nor two on Mr Whately Carington's review of Bulletin I (the Garrett-\nUvani mediumship) of the American Psychical Institute\u2014which\nreview appeared in the Proceedings of recent date.\n\fOctober 1934 Correspondence 289\nMy first is by way of correction\u2014for, although I gave full credit\nin the report to rny wife, Marie Sweet Carrington, your reviewer does\nnot do so. Since the experimentation, as well as the preparation of\nthe report, was undertaken and completed by us jointly, I feel that\nin all fairness she should share in whatever \" credit \" is granted\u2014\nand I have written this letter primarily to correct this oversight.\nThen I should like to suggest that, while the review as a whole\nwas most fairly and generously handled, there seems in our opinion\nto have been too little attention given and emphasis placed upon\nthe \" third entity \" portion of the experiments\u2014which in the last\nanalysis turned out to be the most striking of all the material.\nIf carried to sufficient lengths, this procedure would seem to be\na test which would solve the question of multiple personality vs.\nspirit control\u2014and be, therefore, a very significant and profitable\nfield of enquiry.\nMr Carington seems to have neglected to realize that our Report\nwas an original attempt, and therefore naturally subject to improve-\nments in method, technique, etc., in subsequent work along these\nlines ; nor does he seem to have followed out this \" third entity\n\"\nline of attack in his late experiments.\nIt is quite certain that two or more mediums could not possibly\nhave the same series of secondary or multiple personalities, and it\nwould seem that this test would be the logical step in determining\nthe origin of these so-called entities.\nThis association-word method may also be employed, we believe,\nin securing proper names, often so difficult to obtain otherwise.\nFor instance, in some recent tests, a Christian name was given the\nalleged communicator, and the correct surname given as a reaction\nword, and vice versa. These names were of course quite unknown\nto the medium. In another instance, the name of a person was given\nas the stimulus word, and the reaction word was the name of a town\nwhere this person formerly resided (in life). This type of material\nseems very striking, and capable of being elicited easily by this\nmethod.\nMay we hope that this procedure will be pursued by those having\nthe opportunity to experiment along these lines ? I conclude by\nthanking Mr Whately Carington for his painstaking and judicial\nreview of our Report.\nSincerely yours,\nHereward Carrington.\n\f290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 193\n1\nREVIEWS\nTheodore Besterman, Mrs Annie Besant, A Modern Prophet.\nKegan Paul. Price 10s. 6d.\nMr Besterman has been fortunate in his subject, and he has done\nfull justice to it. The brilliance of Mrs Besant's intellect, superficial\nthough it may have been compared with that of really great thinkers,\nher sincerity and courage, the tempestuous ardour of her activity,\nher unselfish devotion to the causes which she espoused, her great\ngift of eloquence and, beyond all, her almost miraculous capacity for\nwork, all these alone would have made her an interesting and out-\nstanding figure. But it is not these characteristics, admirable\nthough they are, which render her so entrancing a subject for the\nbiographer. It is rather the spectacular nature of the numerous\nchanges in her mental outlook, the completeness of these changes,\nfor Mrs Besant was what is described in the vernacular as a \" whole\nhogger \", and the psychological causes of them which Mr Besterman\nacutely lays bare.\n1\n1'\nI iii.iv use ;i n, nit ical metaphor. Mrs Besanl appears to me as a\nvessel which is heavily over canvased for her draught and weight of\nballast. She will \" sail like a train \", but she cannot hold her course.\nShe is too much for even the most skilful helmsman and some of her\nhelmsmen were not over skilful.\nUnder the guidance of Charles Bradlaugh her work as a social\nreformer was, to continue the metaphor, an example of good plain\nsailing on a well laid course. Though she might have attained to\nhonour and a certain recognition among a limited circle had she held\nthis course, it would not have made her the world-known figure\nwhich she eventually became.\nBut Bradlaugh could not hold her ; a change of wind put her about\nand she heads for socialism. The Pabians take the helm, but again\nshe is too much for them.\nAnother shift in the wind and off she goes with every sail drawing,\nreeling off the knots towards Theosophy.\nIt is perhaps too much to say that Mme Blavatsky or Leadbeater\never took the helm, though they undoubtedly exercised a great\ninfluence over her. I fancy that in this stage of her career she was\nto a great extent her own pilot, and the course she steered was\nlargely her own devising.\nAs Mr Besterman points out, though she claimed to be guided by\ncold reason she was actually swayed by every emotion.\nHer life exhibits several examples of inconsistency towards the\nguiding principles which she adopted, yet one cannot doubt her\nintegrity of purpose in even the most glaring of these, viz. her\nobstinate espousal of Mr Leadbeater's cause. Her emotions entirely\noverpowered her reason.\n\fOCTOBEK 11)34 Reviews 291\nMr Besterman remarks on her utter self-confidence. \" She always\nknew \", and for one who always knows anything is possible and\nanything is right. It is, however, Mr Besterrnan's account of her\nconnection with, and work for the Theosophical Society which will\nbe of special interest for readers of the Journal. Though founded\nby Mme Blavatsky and acknowledging her as a sort of high priest,\nTheosophy is to a great extent the work of Mrs Besant. It could\nhardly have had even the moderate amount of success which it has\nachieved had it not been for her energy and inspiration\u2014in fact I\ndoubt whether it would have continued long in existence at all.\nMr Besterman is most commendably moderate in his references to\nthe alleged occult phenomena which bulk so largely in Theosophy.\nHe accepts, as will, I imagine, all S.P.R. readers, Dr Hodgson's\nhostile report on Mme Blavatsky and her performances.\nHe gives an excellent, if highly condensed, account of the theo-\nsophical teachings and a brief resume of the history of the \" ego\n\"\nwhich became Annie Besant from the time when it animated the\nmineral kingdom on \" the fourth globe of the first round \". a history,\nby the way, which we have to take entirely on trust.\nOne is tempted to wonder how so complicated and fantastic a\nsystem of cosmology, backed by no evidence but even more fantastic\nstories, can be accepted by so many educated people, yet, as Mr\nBesterman says, \" A view held sincerely and with conviction by Mrs\nBesant about herself and embodied in a series of volumes, while it-\nneed not necessarily be accepted, does at least deserve to be fully\ndescribed in a biography of her \".\nI think that there is no reasonable doubt that Mrs Besant did\nundergo supernormal psychical experiences of some sort, but her\nunquestioning acceptance of them at their most superficial face\nvalue, her utter disregard of any rules of evidence or canons of\ncriticism, is sufficient completely to discount their value in the eyes\nof any accustomed to the more scientific outlook of psychical\nresearch.\nTheosophy, Mr Besterman says, is authoritarian : you must take it\nor leave it ; that some highly intelligent persons have taken it is,\nperhaps, a minor psychological puzzle. There is, however, a basis\nof reputable philosophy behind it all, derived for the most part from\nthe Vedantic and Buddhistic systems, and I think that it is this\nphilosophy which has attracted many thoughtful people to study it.\nThe fact that the Theosophical Society continues to gain new\nadherents while at the same time it loses an almost equal number of\nolder members, rather tends to support this view.\nWhether it will continue to flourish , if so stormy a mode of exist-\nence can be described as flourishing, now that Mrs Besant is no\nlonger here to infuse into it her energy and enthusiasm, is a matter\nwhich time alone can show.\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1934\nWhether a new prophet will arise to continue her work or whether\nthe whole structure collapses, Mrs Annie Besant will remain as an\noutstanding and remarkable figure in the history of modern thought\n;\nand Mr Besterman has done good service by his most interesting and\njudicial record of her life and work, a record which will appeal not\nonly to the student of psychical research but also to the general\nreading public.

(Rider.) 5s.\nUnfortunately the only interest these four books from Rider can\npossibly have for students of either psychical research or spiritual-\nism, lies in the fact that each of them is an excellent example of the\nway not to write about either of these subjects.\nAll are uncritical and disconnected, and the first three contain\ndescriptions of physical and direct voice phenomena, with very\nlittle attempt to describe the conditions under which they took place,\nor at times to give even the number, let alone the names, of those\nwho were present.\nIn The Trumpet Shall Sound, Mr Maurice Barbanell describes\ndirect voice sittings with Mrs Estelle Roberts, at which numerous\nwell-known people such as Sir Henry Segrave, Edgar Wallace, Sir\nArthur Conan Doyle, and others, purported to speak. Communi-\ncator's names at these sittings seem to be announced in the direct\nvoice with a clearness and decision which is indeed rare. It seems,\nhowever, that many of those who took part in the seances had\nprivate sittings with Mrs Roberts first.\nDeath's Door Ajar, by J. V. H., and A Witness Through the\nCenturies, by Reginald Hegy, are both about spiritualism in South\nAfrica.\nThe quality of the former can perhaps best be illustrated by a\nquotation from page 67. \" Promiscuous seances seem to be the\nhappy hunting-ground of playful spirits who delight in impersona-\ntions, in masquerades, and in all kinds of deceptions. They can\nread the secret thoughts of sitters as easily as an open book, and they\nuse this clandestine knowledge to pretend they are relatives or\nfriends, giving '\nproofs '\nwhich are absolutely convincing.\"\nMuch of A Witness Through the Centuries consists of descriptions\nof life after death, and messages containing a great deal of what\nAmericans call \" uplift \", said to emanate from the sitters' angel\nguide \" John \".\n\fOctober 1934 Revie ws 293\nMr. Wallis Mansford, author of Bridging Two Worlds, believes that\nhe holds spirit communion with the two deceased poets.

Price 12s. 6d. net.\nIt is difficult to summarise shortly the argument which Mr Grant,\na member of the Society, elaborates in this book, but the main points\nappear to be : that a large number of the phenomena of Psychical\nResearch, both mental and physical, are genuine : that these\nphenomena are not only supernormal but supernatural, and accord-\ningly not reducible to any general laws or principles : that from\nsuch supernatural events the existence of a single cause may be\ninferred, which cause may be named God, and that this implies\nsurvival.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS\nJournal of the British Society of Dowsers, September 1933-June 1934.\nThe four numbers that have so far appeared of this new journal\ntestify to the wide interest in the problems of dowsing. Our know-\nledge of the processes by which the dowser obtains his knowledge\nmay be said to be in inverse ratio to the volume of the evidence that\nhe does in fact find water. It is therefore with some regret that we\nobserve the British Society of Dowsers more and more committing\nthemselves to a physical theory of dowsing, or to what they call\nradiation-perception \". It cannot be too strongly urged that until\nthe rationale of dowsing is better understood it is highly desirable to\nkeep to a non-committal term like dowsing.\nThe articles contained in these four numbers are all quite brief\nand elementary. The outstanding impression they leave is of far\ntoo great a readiness uncritically to accept purely hearsay evidence.\nIt is important that dowsing should be systematically investigated,\nand the British Society of Dowsers, under the able and energetic\ndirection of its President. Colonel A. H. Bell, is in a good position to\nundertake such work. But only if it adheres to the critical methods of\nscientific investigation is it likely to achieve results ofpermanent value.\n\f294 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Octobkr 1934\nThe Hibbert Journal, July 1934.\nHarold P.

W. S. Irving\nIntroductory Note :\nThis is Dora's fourth attempt to give a series of picture-tests\nfrom one of next day's newspapers\u2014following upon Mrs Salter's\nsuggestion that she should be asked to do this. In this case, we\nhad asked her to take her tests from the Evening News. The request\nwas made on 23 January 1934.\nExtract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard on Tuesday, April 24, 1934.\nSitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr Theodore Besterman.\n[Feda]. ... [1] Now, Mr Bill!\nWhat you showing me ? A\nlake, is it ? A lake ? A pool ?\nI think it's a picture test she's\nshowing me, Mr Bill ! Look !\nI think it must be a pool she's\nshowing me. I think I'd better\nuse the word \" pool \". That's\nwhat she showing me. You see,\nI see like ripples\u2014that what\nshe showing me. I see like\nripples, & something that looks\nas if intended to be round-\nshaped\u2014like water. And, what's\nthat ? It isn't ! A long-shaped\nthing, like a long pillow. Look !\nI see a long-shaped thing, like\nthat shape, [Feda draws in the\nair, and Sitter copies her actions\nin his note-book] :\n[1.] On Wednesday, April 25,\n1934, the day after this Sitting,\nI found, on the right hand\nmiddle page of the Evening\nNews, a picture described as\n'\nA Home in London\u2014In a\nLifeboat [sic] On a Park Lake.'\n. . .\n'\nNesting-place of a coot\non a lake at South Norwood, a\nfew yards from the bank. The\nduckling in the picture is an\nintruder.' It will be seen from\nthe sketch that the bird is\nsitting on a round straggly-\nlooking nest made of small\nbranches and twigs of wood.\nThe nest is on a white life-buoy,\nand the life-buoy is floating on\nthe water of the lake.\nwhich seemed to be above the\npool\u2014above it. You know, If\nyou get an egg, & pull it out a\nbit\u2014like that shape !\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1934\n[2.] Then Dora says these\ntwo words :\n\" Grotesque clothes\n\u2014grotesque clothes.\"\n[3.] Narrow ? A narrow way,\nDora? Mr Bill! She's not\nsure if this is in the picture, or\nwhether its just above, or below\nit, but very close to the picture\nis something to do with narrow\nturnings\u2014narrow streets or\nturnings. She seemed to get\nthe word \" narrow \"\n\u2014the word\n\" narrow \"\u2014so will you re-\nmember that ? (Yes.) Em\n\u2014\nShe sure that so close to it that\nwhen you see it, you'll say, \" Oh\nwell ! If that's not part of\nthis picture, can see why she\nthought it was.\"\n[2.] There is only one other\ngroup of pictures, on this page,\nforming an advertisement of\n'\nThis week in London.' 1\nThese\npictures begin about 9 inches\nfrom the first Test-picture, to-\nwards 8 o'clock, and include\ntwo men and a woman in\nGeorgian costumes with old-\nfashioned coach, and lacqueys\n;\na Bow Street runner ; and a\nman riding a bicycle in silk hat,\nand top boots.\n[3.] Six inches below the first\nTest-picture is an article en-\ntitled '\nRunaway Horse in the\nCity.' It says, '\nA horse attached\nto a milk float ran away through\nthe narrow thoroughfare of Little\nBrittain, City, today and bolted\nalong Newgate-street into Bar-\ntholomew-close. . .\n.'\n[4.] What a huge sum of\nmoney, too, is mentioned, a\nlarge sum of money is men-\ntioned, or referred to, or sug-\ngested. She didn't see a picture\nof money\u2014she got the idea of\na large sum of money, but\nagain its connected with the\npicture. It may be that words\nor figures representing money\nare incorporated in the picture.\n[4.] Immediately below the\nfirst Test-picture is an article\nheaded, in large type, '\nStock-\nbroker's \u00a32,500 Libel Damages.'\nIt says, '\nDamages of \u00a32,500\nwere awarded today to Mr. . . .\na stockbroker. . .\n.'\nThis article extends down the\npage till it conies to '\nRunaway\nHorse '\nwhich is immediately\nbelow.\n1\nThere is another illustrated advertisement. \u2014N.

Not\na round dish, but roundish !\nAnd another rather more elon-\ngated object. That's better !\nGrotesque clothes. A large sum\nof money. And a narrow turn-\ning, or turnings. You notice ?\nYes, I do notice. Do you\nnotice, she says, that I've\nreversed the order of the last,\nthe last two items ? (Yes,\nI had noticed.) Keep it that\nway, she says, I think that's\nbetter\u2014I think that's better.\nThat what she says. Yes. She\njust trying to think, Mr Bill,\nwhether she got that as she\nwanted it, Mr Bill, & she think\nshe has. Now, Mr Bill ! Keep\nall that as it is. . . .\n[5.] It will be noticed that by\nreversing the order of the last\ntwo items, Dora has placed\nthem in their correct order as\nyou read down the page from\nCoot's nest.\nA NOTE ON THE ABOVE RECORD AS EVIDENCE OF\nPRECOGNITION\nBy Nea Walker\nThe plan to take the test from the Evening News of the day following\nthe Sitting, was this time carried out. It will be remembered that\nthe corroboration of the previous test published was found in the\nDaily Mail instead {Journal, Vol. 28, p. 280).\nI obtained half a dozen copies of the Evening News. The dates\nof my issues were May 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, and 26, 1934. There appears\nto be in this paper an average of between and 6-|- illustrations\nof one kind and another per page ; this estimate includes topical\nphotographs, illustrations to advertisements, cartoons, crossword\ndiagrams, anything in fact which might serve to fit in with a test of\nthe type under discussion. Seldom is there a page without some\npicture, and I studied these six copies carefully with a view to\nfitting in the details of the test.\n\fNovember 1934 Evidence of Precognition 303\nLet us take the points of the test for the moment as,\n\u2014\n(a) \" a pool . . . ripples, & something that looks as if intended\nto be round-shaped, like water. And ... a long-shaped\nthing, like a long pillow . . . which seemed to be above the\npool, above it. . . . (Feda proceeds to describe this object\nas shaped like an egg '\npulled out a bit ').\"\n(b) \" Grotesque clothes.\"\n(c)\n4i\nA huge sum of money, a large sum of money . . . connected\nwith the picture.\"\n(d) \"A narrow way, the word '\nnarrow ' \".\nIllustrating what my search revealed, I may mention that, the\nfirst number of the newspaper, 17th May, had on page 12, a picture\nof Rickmanswortk aquadrome ;\nthis fitted the test in respect of\n(\u00ab). for sun-umbrellas, showing in perspective as '\nabove '\nthe pool,\nare '\nintended to be round-shaped '\nbut, again owing to perspective,\ngive a more egg-shaped effect, \u2014no less like an elongated egg than the\ntest picture. (6) is not as well matched as on Mr Irving's page ;.\nonly pictures of people in bathing attire being available, (c) the\n'\nhuge '\nor '\nlarge '\nsum of money, is better matched, in an article\nprinted round and relating to the picture, the sums mentioned being\n\u00a312,000 and \u00a310,000. (d) the '\nnarrow '\nitem I did not find.\nThe next number, for 19th May, did not fit (a) as well as did the\nCoot's Nest in the test. However, in regard to (b), in the column\nnext but one, 2| inches away, but level with part of the picture,,\nis the headline,\u2014' To Hospital in her Court Gown ', and these are\n'\ngrotesque clothes '\nin which to go to hospital. As to (c),\u2014-next\nto the picture, is the headline, in heavy type, '\n\u00a3500,000 Girl to\nMarry '.\n(d) Did not appear.\nThe issue of May 21st (p. 8) yielded a photograph very similar\nto that of the test-picture, except for the absence of the life-buoy.\nIn this case the base of the nest looks egg-shaped. And for (c) we\nfind, below the picture, at 7 o\"clock, and directly below the article\nwhich the picture illustrates, writ very large,\u2014 '\n\u00a38,000,000 un-\nclaimed '. This is more prominent on the page than the sum\nmentioned on the test page, and it is '\na huge sum '.\n(6) fails.\nRegarding (d) there was not even the word '\nnarrow '\non the page.\nOf the supposedly subsidiary points, (c) the money item might\nhave proved evidentially negligible as far as this paper is concerned\n(finding a page without something of the kind is less likely than\nfinding one with it) were it not for the interesting reversal of the\norder of (c) and (d) by the communicator, (b) was I think perhaps\nbest fitted on the test page ;\nthough I feel that '\nTo Hospital in\nher Court Gown '\nis quite good.\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1934\nBut (d) proves to be the distinctive point of the test. I searched\ncarefully and laboriously, and I did not find even the word '\nnarrow\n'\non any of the pages where the rest of the points might have fitted.\nTherefore, it will be seen that in no paper studied was there any-\nthing approaching to the sequence of the references which were\noffered as the test.\nI ascertained, a propos of nothing, from Mrs Leonard, that the\npapers she sees regularly are the following,\n\u2014\nDaily Express, Daily\nHerald, Evening Standard, Sunday Express, Radio Times, '\nLady '\nQuarterly Pattern Book. She says that she \" can't take any news-\npapers like Tlie Times or Telegraph for fear of spoiling evidence\nthrough reading births and deaths column.\"\n\fNovember 1!)34 Report of a Picture Test 305\nREPORT OF A PICTURE-TEST\nFROM NEXT DAY'S DAILY MAIL\nBy the Rev. W. S. Irving\nIntroductory Note :\nHaving received two Picture-tests from the next day's Evening\nNews, I asked Dora, in the Personal Control on 24 April 1934, to\ngo back to the Daily Mail for her Picture-tests. The following is\nthe second that she has given since then. This picture, which is de-\nscribed in detail, below, was on the middle page (number 10) of the\nDaily Mail for Friday, 27 July 1934. It was to the right of the\nLeading Article for the day, and it illustrated an article entitled\n\" King John's is not our only lost treasure.\" The description below\nthe picture runs as follows :\n\" Loch Arkaig, Scotland, where Prince Charles is reported to have\nburied treasure worth \u00a330,000 after Culloden. (Inset) Miss Margaret\nNaylor, who made several descents as a diver in Tobermory Bay,\nwhere she attempted to locate a sunken Spanish galleon laden with\ngold.\"\nThe Sitting began at 10.43 a.m., and the Picture-test immediately\nfollowed Feda's greetings, so that the whole must have been given\nbefore 11.0 a.m. on 26 July 1934.\nExtract from a Sitting with ,\n1934. Sitter: Rev.W.SA\n[Feda]. . . .[1] Dora's here, and\nshe says, First of all, may she\nplease give you a Picture-test ?\n(Yes\u2014good.)

Only the part covering\nthe head and neck are shown in\nthe picture . The round glass that\nshould cover the face has not been\nscrewed on, so her face is visible\nthrough the opening.\n[2] Part of the lowering rope\nis visible attached to the neck of\nthe diving costume, and it is\nheld in place by a piece of nar-\nrower rope. This forms a loop\nbetween two sections of rope.\n[3] As stated above, Miss\nNaylor is wearing the diver's\nhead-dress.\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1934\nOUTLINE SKETCH OF THE PAGE OF THE \"\nDAILY MAIL\" REFERRED\nTO IN THIS REPORT\n10 fridav, tjffte SaiIyiEa.it julv27, 1934\nKING JOHN'S Is NOT our\nl\n^t-W] ONLY LOST TREASURE\n* Sentences suggesting quantities as stated in text and annotations.\nf The area enclosed within the dotted lines shows the position of the\nwords in heavy type which appear on the reverse side of the page\nand contain an account of 'Life-saving.'\n\fNovember 1934 Report of a Picture Test 307\n[4] She sees a head\u2014she\ndoesn't know whether its a man\nor woman\u2014a person's head.\nWhen you see it, you'll have to\nlook at it to see which you think\nit is.

Although the face is\nclear, and you can see that there\nis a smile on the face, the circular\nopening is too small for the sex of\nthe diver to be determined.\n[5] There is a round black\nprotuberance near the top, on\neach side of the globular head-\ndress, about the size of a Brussel-\nsprout.\n[6] In addition to the words\nfrom the description of the pic-\nture, \"... buried treasure worth\n\u00a330,000 ... a sunken Spanish\ngalleon laden with gold ...\"\nthere are a number of other sen-\ntences in this article that also\nsuggest \" quantities.\" For ex-\nample :\n\"... legends of great wealth\nhidden in the soil. . .\n.\n'\n\"... gold and plate, worth\nseveral millions of pounds. . . .\n\"\n\"... gems and silver plate\nwere strewn about. ...\" *\n[7] The foreground of the pic-\nture is light.

Lawton and myself appearing in the Journal\nof the A.S.P.R. for May 1934 and adverted to by you in a Note on\np. 294 of your October issue of the S.P.R. Journal just to hand.\nI have merely to say that all my notes of the Debate were handed\nto Dr Lawton who was invited to amplify to a fuller extent his\n\" negative \" contribution ; as I felt it to be scanty. But Dr Lawton,\nin a very cordial rejoinder, declined to supplement this further,\nindicating that he felt the strength of the argument lay upon the\naffirmative side. The Report is therefore admittedly a fair one and\nentirely satisfactory to my opponent in debate.\nYours very truly,\nFredk.

Pp. 142. London. Methuen. 1934. Price 3s. 6d.\nIn organising last winter a series of talks on psychical research by\naccredited investigators the B.B.C. did a real service both to science\nand to the British public. That service is now enhanced by the\npublication of the talks in a cheap and attractive form.\nThe difficulties confronting the promoters of such a scheme are\nconsiderable. As in all wireless talks on scientific subjects, the\nspeakers must make their points in a minimum of time, and make\nthem without lapsing into jargon or into vagueness. And in a matter\nso controversial as psychical research the public has a right to\nexpect that two further conditions shall be observed : the sym-\nposiasts must represent between them as many as possible of the\ndivergent points of view current among educated researchers ; and\nin urging their case they must scrupulously avoid overstatement,\nsensationalism, the confusion of fact with hypothesis\u2014on survival,\nespecially, the man who makes a pronouncement before a million\nof his fellows assumes a very serious responsibility.\nIn the present series a praiseworthy, if not completely successful,\nattempt has been made to satisfy these requirements. The attitudes\nrepresented range from the orthodoxy of Prof. Seligman, who keeps\nthroughout to the safe ground of suggestion and dissociation, to the\ndecidedly \" left-wing \" views of Dame Edith Lyttelton, Sir Ernest\nBennett and Sir Oliver Lodge. Personally, had I been picking a\nteam, I should have tried to include a more explicit sceptic than\nProf. Seligman, and also a champion of the hypothesis\u2014increasingly\ninfluential on the continent\u2014which explains the supernormal\nelement in mediumistic phenomena solely by the medium's own\npowers. Room might have been found for these by omitting the\ndiscussion on the fire-walk, which, though interesting in itself, fills\nrelatively too much space and is too loosely linked with the central\ntopics.\nMost of the speakers handle with skill and discretion the themes\nassigned to them. Mr Heard's introductory remarks could scarcely\nbe bettered ; Mr Besterman is sound and interesting on \" How\nPsychical Research is done \" ; Lord Charles Hope on Physical\nMediumship and Mrs Salter on Telepathy provide admirable sum-\nmaries of evidence ; and the concluding talk by Prof. Broad might\nstand as a model of concise, lucid, and dispassionate exposition.\nI was disappointed that Dame Edith Lyttelton concerned herself less\nwith the evidential status of the belief in precognition than with its\nmetaphysical implications ; and I found myself quarrelling more\nthan once with Sir Ernest Bennett, as when he called deferred\n\fNovember 1934 Revieivs 311\ntelepathy a \" strange \" hypothesis, \" unverified and unverifiable \".\nUnverified possibly, though evidence slowly accumulates in its\nfavour. But why unverifiable ? And why strange ? If, as most of\nus believe for good reasons (cf. Mrs Salter, p. 68), telepathic messages\nare first apprehended subconsciously, it would be a deal stranger\nthat they should always penetrate to consciousness on the instant.\nIn the next paragraph Sir Ernest appears (doubtless by an over-\nsight) to confuse phantasms of the dead with those of the dying ;\nand a little further on I am left gasping by the importance he\nattaches to hallucinations experienced by moribund children\n(\" surely these little ones knew nothing of death and its problems \").\nBut it takes all sorts to make a symposium ; and if sentiment here\nand there seeps in through the gaps in the logic, we can turn for a\ncorrective to Prof. Broad, who will be \" slightly more annoyed than\nsurprised \" if he finds himself surviving the death of his present bodv.\nE. B. D.'\nMes W. H. Salter, Evidence for Telepathy : the Response to a\nBroadcast Request for Cases. Pp. 87. London, Sidgwick and\nJackson. 1934.\nMrs Salter appealed in her broadcast talk for reports by listeners\nof apparently telepathic experiences : she received as a result about\n400 letters, and these when sifted revealed 58 cases which appeared\nto merit closer examination. This little book (which can be had for\n2s. of the Secretary, S.P.R.) contains an analysis of the 58 stories,\nand reproduces about 40 of them either verbatim or in a summarised\nform. In most of them, as Mrs Salter recognises, it would be easy\nfor a sceptic to pick holes : only 6 cases are placed by her in \" Grade\nI \", as being both recent (within the last three years) and fully\ncorroborated ; in only one of these six, which are all of them death\n\u2014\nor illness\u2014coincidences, was the identity of the presumed agent\ndefinitely and correctly apprehended by the percipient at the time\nof his experience ; and in that one case (a dream occurring 24 hours\nafter agent's death) the agent was already known to be ill. The\nreally impressive coincidences are to be found, alas, in \" Grade II\n,;\n.\nNevertheless the book as a whole does afford some answer to those\npersons who assert that in our enlightened age spontaneous telepathy\nno longer occurs ; and it may be hoped that a perusal of it will\ninduce future percipients to record their experiences promptly and\nsend them to the S.P.R. with the fullest corroboration available.\nI must add that the curious will find in \" Grade II \" at least one\ndelightfully entertaining narrative ; also an instructive example of\nthe way in which material of apparently telepathic origin may be\ncasually used to embellish the symbolic details of a disguised sex\ndream.

In the report which was\nfirst sent to us it appeared that the impression coincided in time\nwith the onset of the illness, in which case the incident should be\nclassified as telepathic ;\nsubsequently the percipient, Mrs Prior,\nwas inclined to think that the impression had occurred at an earlier\ndate, in which case it must be regarded as previsional. It appears\ncertain that the impression was received and told to more than one\nwitness before Mrs Prior had any normal knowledge of the illness, j\nThe first report of the^case was contained in a letter sent to the\nSecretary, Miss Newton, in response to the request for evidence of\ntelepathy broadcast by Mrs Salter on 16 February 1934. Mrs\nGarrett, of Teignmouth, wrote as follows on 17 February 1934 :\n\" Listening to Mrs W. H. Salter's talk over the wireless last night\non telepathy and hearing her ask any one listening in who had\nanything evidential to send and let you know, so am sending an\nexperience my sister in West Australia had.\nMy husband had been in indifferent health for some time, but\nnot really ill, and we did not anticipate there was anything serious\nwrong, had not seen his doctor for 9 months. He was taken very\nill on the 8th July (Saturday) and the next day asked a nurse to\ncome in and see him. (She had previously given him treatment.)\nShe came at about 2.30 and almost at once he was taken worse.\nShe said, '\nThis is serious, we must have a doctor at once. Dr D.\n(our own doctor) is away for the day. Who shall I fetch ?\n'\nI said,\n'\nDr K.', who lives just opposite. He came at once. After examina-\ntion he told me it was a growth and most likely my husband would\nonly last about 24 hours. Our own doctor came about 6 p.m. and\nverified this ; also a specialist who came about 10.30 p.m. My\nhusband rallied a little and then passed away on the 18th July.\nI sent my sister a cable the same morning which she received the\nnext day. Then she wrote telling me her experience.\"\n\fDecember 1934 Case 317\nMrs Garrett then proceeded to give an account of her sister,\nMrs Prior's experience, but as she afterwards sent us the letter she\nhad from Mrs Prior and we have also heard from Mrs Prior herself, it\nis not necessary to give Mrs Garrett's statement. On 13 August\n1934 Mrs Prior, who lives in Swanbourne, West Australia, wrote a\nletter to Mrs Garrett from which we give the following extract :\n\" You will remember the Sunday you sent by 'phone for M. On\nthe day previous, Saturday, at about 6.30 a.m. to 6.45 a.m., with\nyou summer time (1.30 p.m. to 1.45 p.m. here), were you watching\nHerbert specially, was he particularly bad just then ? Has your\ndoctor (or one of the doctors who attended) two rather deep furrows\ndown side of nose and cheek, so ) ( (He was dark.) My explanation\nis rather crude. But can you understand my description ? Because\nI think it may comfort you to know that I got your strong thought-\nwave, or whatever it was that came to me. Whilst wide awake,\nbut resting on a chair in our dining-room for a few minutes, just\nbefore removing the dinner dishes after Saturday's midday meal, I\nhad my eyes closed, but it was all as clear to me as looking at a\n'\npicture screen '. Many figures came and went, then the one man\nI have tried to describe to you occupied the whole screen. He went,\nand beyond him, or where he had stood, I distinctly saw Herbert,\njust the face, apparently asleep. In astonishment I looked, till I\nrecognised who it was, then jumped up, ran to Harry in our bed-\nroom, where he was busy changing his suit, ready for his Saturday\nafternoon's work about the house, and described it all, adding, '\nI\nhope nothing is wrong. I'm afraid Herbert may be ill '. I then\nsaid to Harry, '\nI shall forget all about this, but I want you to\nremember I am not dreaming '.\nAll day after your cable came I kept saying '\nThere's something\nI've got to remember in connexion with this. What is it 1\nJust before we fell asleep that night I suddenly remembered that\nstrange vision, which I believe was a most intense thought-wave\nsent by you and because I happened to be '\nreceptive '\nat that\nparticular moment I got it, because we were '\ntuned in '\nas it were.\"\nHaving seen the above letter from Mrs Prior to Mrs Garrett,\nMiss Newton wrote to Mrs Prior asking if she could send us a cor-\nroborative statement from her husband and from any other person\nto whom she had mentioned her experience before she knew of\nMr Garrett's illness. In reply she received the following statement\nfrom Mrs Prior, dated 31 March 1934 :\n\" Having had the following very strange experience some months\nago, I have decided to write it in detail that I may not forget the\nfacts. Unfortunately at the time I did not make a note of the date,\nbut I am absolutely certain that it was on a Saturday afternoon,\nsomewhere about 1.30 p.m., towards the end of June or early part\nof July 1933.\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1934\nMy husband and I had just finished dinner on that particular\nSaturday, and I left the table, to sit quietly in an easy chair by\nthe dining-room window to rest for a few minutes, before removing\nthe dishes, whilst my husband sat silently reading the newspaper.\nI closed my eyes, but did not sleep. In a very short time I saw (as\non a picture screen) people coming and going in great haste ;\nso\nquickly did they cross the vision of my screen that I could not\nrecognise them or describe them. I was interested, but did not\nmove, though I knew my husband had just left the table and had\ngone into the bedroom. I sat perfectly still with my eyes closed.\nThe hurrying to and fro of people I could not recognise ceased, and\nthe whole screen of my vision was taken up by a man, who was\nquite still, as in a photograph. He was shown full-face, head,\nshoulders and chest. He looked straight ahead with a very sad\nand grave expression. I would call him dark and rather muscular,\nand thickset (from the general appearance of head and shoulders).\nHe wore dark clothing ; the suit or gown, or coat, being of some\nrough, or rather coarsely-woven material. But what I noticed\nabove all was the deep lines, like furrows, in either side of his face,\nso :\n) ( As I looked he left the screen, as instantaneously as he had\nappeared, and away in the background of my field of vision I saw\nwhat I took to be a man lying ill in bed. Here again I only saw the\nface, very, very thin, apparently asleep on his back. There was a\nrim of light round his head. As I looked I thought, '\nI know you.\nWho are you ?\n'\nThen I knew without a doubt it was Herbert,\nmy brother-in-law, and I recognised him then. I hurried to the\nbedroom to tell my husband this strange experience. I said, '\nI'm\nafraid there is something wrong in Teignmouth (Eng.). Herbert is\nill '. Then I detailed what I had seen, exactly as I have described\nit here, adding, '\nYou'll believe me, won't you ? I was not asleep,\nand I know I shall forget all about it, so that if there is anything\nwrong, will you remember that I told you all about it and that I\ndid not dream it ?\n'\n. . . For some days this strange event was very\nmuch in my mind and I recounted it in every detail to a friend, Mrs W.\nI am almost sure it was on the following Monday morning I told Mrs W.\nI knew that Herbert was in poor health and that my sister was\nworrying about it, and yet the weekly letters from my sister told me\nregularly of the work Herbert was doing in his orchard or home. As\na matter of fact my sister was far from being in the best of health at\nthis time, and my thoughts were so much on her condition that Her-\nbert's state of health had not worried me to any considerable extent.\nOn Wednesday morning July 19th I received a cable from my\nsister in England, telling me that Herbert had passed away on the\nTuesday, July 18th. All that day I kept saying, '\nI've known all\nabout this. What is it I have to remember in connexion with this ?\n'\nNever once that day did my memory recall my strange experience,\n\fDkckmbek 1934 Case 319\nthough I asked my husband to help me. He too had forgotten.\nThen like a flash at midnight it came to me and I knew I had seen\nHerbert as he lay ill, though we were in body thousands of miles\naway. I wish to make it quite clear that my husband and I had\nforgotten everything, which must help to prove my statement that\nI had this prevision some weeks before the events occurred.\nMy sister now tells me that I have described the doctor she had\nto call in. I have never seen him. She believes the marks I called\nfurrows are '\nwar-wounds '.\nThe events as I saw them apparently happened on a Sunday\n(2.30 p.m.) in Devonshire, England. . . .\nWhat was the band or rim of light I saw around Herbert's face\nand head, following the contour perfectly ? I did not imagine that\nlight any more than I imagined those very deep lines on the doctor's\nface and the very earnest, sad expression. It is more than surprising\nto myself that I so quickly dismissed this strange experience from\nmy mind, and I think maybe the following reasons may have had a\nbearing on it : (1) the letters from my sister in England that reached\nme after the prevision and before the cable came told me of the\nwork Herbert was doing in his orchard, digging out some old apple-\ntrees and replacing them with others he had reared himself. . . .\n(2) I told myself I should forget it and my mind obeyed. I did.\n(3) It was my sister's health that was troubling me and not to any\ngreat extent that of Herbert. He was so active, assisting the man\nto plant the trees, that I could not think of him as being seriously ill.\nA letter from England to me in Australia takes four weeks. My\nbrother-in-law was only seriously ill 10 days, so that the first inti-\nmation I had was the cable that told of his '\npassing '.\n(Signed) Florence Prior.\"\nWith this letter Mrs Prior enclosed two corroborative statements,\nfrom her husband and from the friend in Australia to whom she\nmentioned her experience at the time. These statements, both of\nwhich are dated 31 March 1934, were as follows :\n(1) \"I have read the report of the extraordinary incident recorded\nby my wife which accompanies this letter and can assure you that it\nis accurate in detail, only unfortunately the exact period of time\nof its occurrence cannot be given owing to its not being written at\nthe time, but I am certain that some weeks elapsed between the\nvision and the event which it previsioned ; also I can definitely tell\nyou my wife was not sleeping when she saw what she had related.\"\n(2)\n\" Mrs Prior has asked me to verify her statement. I wish to\nstate that one Saturday evening she came to my house and related\nthe experience she had had that afternoon, particularly mentioning\nthat she was not sleeping at the time, only resting. I cannot\nremember the date, but recollect her coming over on the following\nMonday and referring to the incident again.\"\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1934\nWe have also received a corroborative statement from the nurse\nin England to the effect that she was called in to see Mr Garrett at\n2.30 p.m. on 9 July 1933 and went immediately to fetch Dr K.\nWith regard to Mrs Prior's impression of the doctor's appearance\nand especially of the lines on his face, Mrs Garrett informed us in\nher original letter of 17 February 1934 that Dr K. \" has lines or\nridges, sort of lines one side of his face, I believe through war service\n'\n'\n.\nShe subsequently told us that Mrs Prior had never seen Dr K., and al-\nthough she had seen him herself before he was called in on 9 July 1933,\nhis appearance had never made any great impression on her mind.\nWith regard to the question of whether this incident is to be\nregarded as affording evidence of prevision, the following points\nmay be noted :\n(1) The most nearly contemporary evidence we have as to the\ndate of Mrs Prior's experience is contained in her letter to Mrs\nGarrett of 13 August 1933. At this time she appears to have thought\nthat her vision occurred on the Saturday upon which Mr Garrett's\nfatal illness began. Subsequently she came to the conclusion that\nit had occurred earlier, \" some weeks before the events occurred \".\nIt should, however, be remembered that even supposing that Mrs\nPrior's experience took place as late as 8 July, eleven days elapsed\nbefore she had a cable on 19 July informing her of Mr Garrett's\ndeath. Mrs Prior's chief reason for putting the vision to an earlier\ndate seems to be that it had faded from her conscious mind so com-\npletely when she heard of the death. But Mrs Prior herself gives\na possible explanation of this, and perhaps does not realise how apt\nimpressions, subconsciously received, are to fade from consciousness.\n(2) Assuming that Mrs Prior's experience occurred on 8 July, it\nstill contains a previsional element, if we can be sure that her\nimpression of Dr. K.'s appearance was veridical, for Dr K. was not\ncalled in to see Mr Garrett until 9 July, and on 8 July there was no\nintention on anybody's part to call him in, since he was not Mr\nGarrett's regular doctor.\nREVIEWS\nJ. Arthur Hill, Experiences with Mediums. 8vo. Pp. 221. Lon-\ndon, Rider & Co. 1934. Price 7s. 6d.\nThe aim of this book is to show that Psychical Research presents\nproblems that cannot be explained by telepathy from the sitter nor,\nin some cases, by even \" link \" telepathy.\nThe author begins by making clear the frame of mind in which\nhe first approached the subject of Psychical Research and then pro-\nceeds to narrate experiments he made with the medium Aaron\nWilkinson. He first gives cases where evidential details known to\nhim about himself and others are mixed with details he did not\n\fDeckmbkr l'J34 Reviews 321\nknow consciously and which he feels sure he did not know sub-\nconsciously. He then goes on to re-tell the \" Napier Lund \" case\nwhich, he contends, rules out not only telepathy from the sitter but\nalso \" link \" telepathy, leaving only the possibility of telepathy\nfrom some unknown, \" unlinked \" mind ; a possibility which he\ndeclines to entertain.\nAn interesting section of the book is that composed of evidential\ndetails concerning deceased persons whom the author knew only\nthrough correspondence over psychical research. Another interest-\ning case concerns details, given through two different mediums, of an\nunidentified \" communicator \" named Slater. Mr Hill has inserted\nit in the hope that some reader may be able to clear up the mystery.\nAs the book is largely composed of accounts of the author's\nsittings with \"Wilkinson, he introduces, as corroborative evidence,\nthe experiences with the same medium of three other sitters, one of\nwhom. Canon Freeman of Bristol Cathedral, contributes to the book\na \" Confirmatory Letter \". There is also an interesting and useful\nchapter on Wilkinson himself.\nThe book is well planned, lucidly written and free from dogmatism.\nThe records are taken from notes made verbatim during the sittings,\nand this is as much as can be expected of any experimenter at\npresent. Some day we may be able to listen to and watch a repro-\nduction of a sitting, for even verbatim notes leave unrecorded many\ndetails of vital importance. Much may depend, for instance, on the\ndegree of hesitation or decision with which a sitter makes a remark\nor even on the intonation of his voice.\nMany critics, however, would consider that the evidence in this\nbook is such as to dispose of doubt on this score ; and so there\nremains for final consideration the question of the medium's honesty.\nThis is the crux of the problem presented by the book, and the\ndifficulty is, of course, realised by the author, who refers to it many\ntimes. He, however, has an advantage over the reader :\n\" I dismiss\nordinary fraud, for I knew Wilkinson for twenty years and never\nfound him out in any deviation from complete honesty \"\n(p. 102).\nAnd, indeed, many investigators who have experimented with one\nparticular medium over a number of years could use similar lan-\nguage ; but there remains the difficulty, inseparable from Psychical\nEesearch at its present stage, of inspiring the reader with the same\nconfidence. J. W. F.\nShaw Desmond, We do not Die. Arthur Barker, Ltd. 1934.\nPrice, 8s. 6d.\nThe promise of the somewhat flamboyant title which Mr Shaw\nDesmond has chosen for his book is amply fulfilled in the text. He\nwrites in what the publisher's advertisement would probably call\na \" vivid and arresting \" style. It is a style which, though possibly\n\f322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1934\nsuitable for the more sensational crime stories, is hardly adapted for\nserious discussion of a very serious subject. Let me quote a couple\nof passages taken more or less at random as a sample. Page 67 :\n\" But when you were told these things you laughed at the sayers\n\u2014\ncalled them, forsooth !\n'\nsoothsayers '.\nThe men of science turned\na deaf ear to them and with a scientific grin and perfunctory examina-\ntion turned them down\u2014until recently, when the accumulated\nevidence broke through even the leaden sarcophagi of science \".\nAnd page 239 :\n\" For there is a vulgarity of science as well as of\nsociety, and the grinning materialist's blah-blah inside or outside\nthe seance room is the belch of the ill-bred man in the face of de-\ncency \". However, an unpleasing and unsuitable style is, after all,\nonly a surface defect ; in a book like this it is what the author has\nto say that matters, rather than how he says it.\nI regret that I find the contents as little satisfactory as the style.\nWhile Mr Desmond claims a very extensive personal experience of\nsupernormal phenomena, of evidence, in the sense in which psychical\nresearch uses that word, there is practically none given, nor is there\nany reasoned discussion.\nWe are told a great deal about \" the other side \" and those\nacquainted with theosophical literature will recognise much as\nfamiliar. The conditions of life after death are described with a\nwealth of detail, but we have to take Mr Desmond's word for the\naccuracy of the description.\nAs fanciful speculations they may be of interest to those who\ncare for that sort of thing, but as serious contributions to knowledge\nthey seem to me to be of little value.\nMr Desmond hits out right and left with astonishing vigour, in\nfact he spends a large part of his time in doing so. While he trounces\nthe poor scientist very thoroughly, he does at least allow him some\nvirtues. He finds very little good to say about those whom he calls\nthe \" osophists \". I do not imagine that the scientific world will be\nseriously disturbed by his strictures ; the work will probably go on\nvery much as before.\nMr Desmond is evidently a man of varied accomplishments ; he\nhas travelled widely, he can play cricket and the piano, dance,\nwrite novels and grow roses, etc., etc. He is an expert at jiu-jitsu\nand, as a crowning achievement, he has made a voyage round the\nHorn on a windjammer. I have some personal knowledge of life\nat sea myself, though, I confess, not in sail, but I cannot see that it is\nlikely to induce any special aptitude for psychical research.\nMy advice to those interested in psychical research proper who\nfeel inclined to read this book is this. First read through one\nchapter as a sample, say Chap. XXIX on Ghosts. Then if you like\nthat, go ahead and wade through the rest. You may be amused ; I\nfear you will not be instructed. H. F.
