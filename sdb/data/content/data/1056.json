It is possible that the journal as a monthly began publishing in May 1931, running through July, and then was begun again in February 1932, since Liberation  in several 1933 issues regularly tried to sell back issues with those dates.  In March 1934 the journal was called Journal of the Silver Shirts of America, and the Journal of the Silver Legion of America.  Suspended April 1934-1936 after Pelley was indicted in North Carolina under the Blue Sky Laws for selling unregistered stock in his publishing enterprise and its place taken by Pelley's\/Pelley's Weekly.  In 1936 publication was begun again as Liberation.  The journal when it first appeared as a monthly followed the same spiritualist\/occult themes as its predecessors:  There is no death, reincarnation, planned rebirth, prophecy, etc., but increasingly, especially after the change to weekly presentation and becoming the organ of Pelley's Silver Shirts, the journal commented on political matters and began to give unbridled vent to gross anti-Semitism, anti-communism, opposition to the Federal Reserve and all international banks, Jewish or not, conspiracies surrounding Lincoln's assassination, \"The Truth About American History,\" etc., and to call for the establishment of a Christian Democracy in the United States.
