STATEMENT AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE COMMITTEE.\nIn May, 1884, the Council of the Society for Psychical Research\nappointed a Committee for the purpose of taking such evidence as to\nthe alleged phenomena connected with the Theosophical Society as\nmight be offert'd by members of that body at the time in England, or\nas could be collected elsewhere.\nThe Committee consisted of the following members, witl) power to\nadd to their number :-Messrs. E. Gurney, F. W. H. Myers, F. Podmore.\nH. Sidgwick, and J. H. Stack. They have since added Mr. R. Hodgson\nand Mrs. H. Sidgwick 10 their number.\nFor the convenience of Members who may not have followed the\nprogress of the Theosophical Society, 0. few words of preliminary\nexplanation may be added here.\n(The Theosophical Society was founded in New York, in 1875, by\nColonel Olcott and Madame Blavatsky, ostensibly for certain philan-\nthropic and literary purposes. Its headquarters were removl'd to Indiain\n1878, and it made considerable progress among the Hindus a.nd other\n\u2022 As this Committee bad carried out a large portion of its work before the appoint.\nment of the Committee of Reference, its Report hllll, by exception, not been nbmitted\nthat body.\nP\nDigitized by Google\n\f202 8t\u00abirmellt of tile Committee\neducated natives.)\"The Occult WorId,\" by Mr.Sinnett,at that time editor\nof the Pioneer, introduced the Society to English readers, and that work,\nwhich dealt mainly with phenomena, was succeeded by \"Esoteric\nBuddhism,\" in which some tenets of the Occult doctrine, or so-called\n\"Wisdom-rehgion,\" were set forth. But with these doctrines the\nCommittee have, of course, no concern.\nThe Committee had the opportunity of examining Colonel Olcott\nalld Madame Blavatsky, who spent some months in England in\nthe summer of 1884, and Mr. Mohini M. ChatteIji, a Brahmin\ngraduate of the University of Calcutta, who accompanied them. Mr.\nSinnett also gave evidence before the Committee; and(they have\n11ad before them oral and written testimony from numerous other\nmembers of the Theosophical Society in England, India, and other\ncountriesJ besides the accounts of phenomena published in \"The\nOccult World,\" \"Hints on Esoteric Theosophy,\" TIle TlleoBopltist,\nand elsewhere.\n( According to this evidence, there exists in Thibet a brotherhood\n~ose members have acquired a power over nature which enables them\nto perform wonders beyond the reach of ordinary men. Madame\nBlavatsky asserts herself to be a Cltela, or disciple of these Brothers\n(spoken of also as Adepts and as .lIalwtmas), and they are alleged to have\ninterested themselves in a special way in the Theosophical Society, and\nto have performed many marvels in connection with it. They are said\nto be able to cause apparitions of themselves in places where theil\"\nbodies are not, and not only to appear, but to communicate intelligently\nwith those whom they thus visit, and themselves to perceivewhat is going\non where their phantasm appears. This phantasmal appearance has\nbeen called by Theosophists the projection of the \"astral form.\"\nThe evidence before the Committee includes several cases of such\nalleged appearances of two Mahatmas, Koot Hoomi and Morya. It is\nfurther alleged that their Chelas, or disciples, are gradually taught this\nart, and that Mr. Damoda.r K. Mavalankar in particular, a Theosophist\nresiding at the headquarters of t~ Society, has acquired it, and has\npractised it on several occasions.)It may be observed that these\nalleged voluntary apparitions, though carrying us considerably beyond\nany evidence that has been collected from other sources, still have\nmuch analogy with some cases that have come undel\" the notice of the\nLiterary Committee.\n(But we cannot separate the evidence offered by the Theosophists\nfor projections of the\" astral form,\" from the evidence which they also\noffer for a different class of phenomena, similar to some which are said\nby Spiritualists to occur through the agp.Dcy of mediums, and which\ninvolve the action of \"psychical\" energies on ponderable matter; since\nsuch phenomena are usually described either as (1) accompanying\nDigitized by Google\n\f203\napparitions of the Mahatmas or their disciples, 01' (2) at auy rate as\ncarrying with them a manifest reference to their agency.\nThe alleged phenomena which come under this head consist-so far\nas we need at present take them into account-in the transportation,\neven through solid matter, of ponderable objects, including letters,\nand of what the Theosophists regard as their dupliclOtion; together\nwith what is called \"precipitation\" of handwriting and drawings on\npreviously blank pa~r. The evocation of sound without pllysical means\nis also said to occur. j\nIn December, 1884, the Committee considered that the time had\ncome to issue a preliminary and provisional Report. This Report, on\naccount of its provisional character, and for other reasons, was circu-\nlated among Members and Associates of the Society for Psychical\nResearch only, and not published. In drawing up the present Report,\ntherefore, the Committee have not assumed that their readers will be\nacquainted with the former one. The conclusion then come to was\nexpressed as follows: \"On the whole (though with soma serious\nreserves), it seems undeniable that there is a prima facie case, for some\npart, at least, of the claim made, which, at the point which the investi\u00b7\ngations of the Society for Psychical Research have now reached, calUlot,\nwith consistency, be ignored. And it seems plain that an actual\nresidence for some months in India of some trusted observer-his actual\nintercourse with the persons concerned, Hindu and European, so far\nas may be permitted to him-is all almost necessary pre-requisite of\nany more definite judgment.\"\nIn accordance with this view, a member of the Committet.', Mr. R.\nHod~n, B.A., Scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge,-~\u00ad\nceeded to India in November, 1884, and, after carrying 011 his\ninvestigations for three months, returned in April, 1~_\n! In the Madras Clu-utian College Magazine for September and\nOctober, 1884, portions of certain letters were published which pur-\nported to have been written by Madame Blavatsky to a M. and\nMadame Coulomb, who had occupied positions of trust at the head-\nquarters of the TheOsophical Society for some years,but had been expelled\nfrom it in May, 1884, by the Geneml Council of that Society eluring\nthe absence of Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott in Europe. These\nletters, if genuine, unquestionably implicated Madame Blavatsky in a\nconspiracy to produce marvellous phenomena fraudulently; but they were\ndeclared by her to be, in whole or in part, forgeries. Oneimportant object\nof Mr. Hodgson's visit to India was to ascertain, if possible, by examining\nthe letters, and by verifying facts implied or stated in them, and tho\nexplanations of the Coulombs concerning them, whether the letters\nwere genuine or not. The editor'of the Cl,ristian College Maga::.ine\nhad already, as Mr. Hodgson found, taken considerable pains to\np 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f20-1 Statemellt of tile Oommittee\nascertaiu this; but he had not been able to obtain the judgment of\na recognised expert in handwriting. Accordingly lip selection of the\nletters, amply sufficient to prove the conspiracy, was entrusted by the\neditor, (in whose charge Madame Coulomb had placed them,) to Mr.\nHodgson, who sent it home before his own return. These, together\nwith some letters undoubtedly written by Madame Blavatsky, were\nsubmitted to the well-known expert in handwriting, Mr. Netherclift,\nand also to Mr. Sims, of the British Museum. These gentlemen came\nindependently to the conclusion that the letters were written by\nMadame Blavatsky. This opinion is entirely in accordance with the im-\npression produced on the Committee by the general aspect of the letters,\nas well as by their characteristic style, and much of their contents.\nThe Committee further desired that Mr. Hodgson should, by cross\u00b7\nexamination and otherwise, obtain evidence tbat might assist them iu\njudging of the value to be attached to the testimony of some of the\nprincipal ,vitnesses; that he should examine localities where pheno-\nmena had occurred, with a view to ascertaining whether the explanations\nby trickery, that suggested themselves to the Committee, or any other\nsuch explanations, were possible; and iu particular, as already said,\nthat he should, as far as possible, verify the statements of the Coulombs\nwith a view to judging whether their explanations of the phenomena\nwere plausible. For it is obvious that no value for the purposes of\npsychical research call be attached to phenomena where persons like\nthe Coulombs have been concerned, if it can be plausibly shown that\nthey might themselves have produced them: while, at the same time,\ntheir unsupported assertion that they did produce them, cannot be\n~en by itself as evidence. ..\n( After hearing what Mr. Hodgson had to say on these points, and\nafter carefully weighing all the evidence before them, the Committee\nunanimously arrived at the following conclusions :-\n(1) That of the letters put forward by Madame Coulomb, all those,\nat lfl8.8t, which the Committee have had the opportunity of\nthemselves examining, and of submitting to the judgment of\nexperts, are undoubtedly written by Madame Blavatsky; and\nsuffice to prove that she has been engaged in a long-continued\ncombination with other persons to produce by ordinary means\na series of apparent marvels for the support of the Theosophic\nmovement.\n(2) That, in particular, the Shrine at Adyar, through which letters\npurporting to come from Mahatmas were received, was embo-\nratelyarranged with a view to the secret insertion of letters and\nother objects through a sliding panel at the back, and regularly\nused for this purpose by Madame Blavatsky or her agent-s.\n(3) l'hat there is consequently a very strong general presumption\nDigitized by Google\n\f01, Pl,enOmCllQ cOImecfetl trill, Theosophy. 205\nthat all the marvellous narratives put forward as evidence of\nthe existence and occult power of the ~Iahatmas are to be\nexplained as due either (a) to deliberate deception carried out\nby or at the instigation of Madame Blavatsky, or (6) to spon-\ntaneous illusion, or hallucination, or unconscious misrepl'esen-\nta.t!.on or invention on the part of the witnesses.\n(4) rIilttafter examining Mr. Hodgson's report of the results of his\npersonal inquiries, they are of opinion that the testimony to\nthese marvels is in no case sufficient, taking amount and\ncharacter together, to resist the force of the general presump-\ntion above mentioned.\nAccordingly, they think that it would be a waste of time to prolong\nthe investigation.\nAs to the correctness of Mr. Hodg'lOn's explanation of particular\nmarvels, they do not feel co.lled upon to express any definite conclusion;\nsince on the one hand, they are not in a position to endorse every detail\nof this explanation, and on the other hand they have satisfied them-\nselves t\\s to the thorougbness of Mr. Hodgson's investigation, and l\\ave\ncomplete reliance on his impartiality, and they recognise that his means\nof arriving at a correct conclusion are far beyond any to which they call\nlay claim.\nThere is only one special point on which the Committee think\nthemselves bound to state explicitly a modification of their original\nview. They said in effect in their First Report that if certain phenomena\nwere not genuine it was very difficult to suppose that Colonel Olcott\nwas not implicated in the fraud. But after considering the evidence that\nMr. Hodgson has laid before them as to Colonel Olcott's extraordinary\ncredulity, and inaccuracy in observation and inference, they desire to\ndisclaim any intention of imputing wilful deception to that gentleman.\nThe Committee have no desire that their conclusion should be\naccepted without examination, and wish to afford the reader every\nopportunity of forming a judgment for himself. They therefore append\nlIr. Hodgson's account of his investigation, which will be found to form\nby far the largest and most important part of the present Report. In\nit, and the appendices to it, is incorporated enough of the evidence\ngiven by members of the Theosophical Society to afford the reader ample\nopportunity of judging of both its quantity and quality.\nThere is, however, evidence for certain phenomena which did not\noccur in India, and are not directly dealt with in Mr. Hodgson's Report.\nAccounts of these will be found at p. 382, with some remarks on them\nJ'y Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nThe report of Mr. Netherclift 011 the handwriting of the Blavo.tsky-\nCoulomb letters will be found at p. 381. Extracts from the letters\nthemselves are given in Mr. Hodgson's Report, pp. 211-216.\nDigitized by Google\n\f206 Statemcllt of tlte Oommittee\nThe authorship of the letters attributed to Koot Hoomi, which\nare nry numerous, and many of them very long, is fully discussed in\nMr. Hodgson's Report. It may be mentioned here that it is maintained\nby some that the contents of these letters are such as to preclude the\npossibility of their having been written by Madame Blavatsky. This\nhas never bren the opinion of the Committee, either as regards the\npublished letters or those that have been privately shown to them in\nmanust:lript. Those who wish to form an independent opinion on the\nsu~jeci are referred to \"The Occult World\" and\" Esoteric Buddhism,\"\nwhich contain many of the letters thenlselV'E:'s, and much matter derived\nfrom others.\n,. , \/Tn- this connection may be conveniently mentioned what the Com-\n-\/mittee, in theil\u00b7 First Report, called the most serious blot which had then\nbeen pointed out in the Theosophic evidence. A certain letter, in the\nKoot Hoomi handwriting, and addressed avowedly by Koot Hoolni,\nfrom Thibet, to lIr. Sinnett, in 1880, was proved by Mr. H. KiddIe,\nof New York, to contain a long passage apparently plagiarised from a\nspeech of Ml.. KiddIe's, made at Lake Pleasant, August 15th, 1880,\nand reported in the BantlM' oj Light some two months or more previous\nto the date of Koot Hoomi's letter. Koot Hoomi replied (some'\nmonths later) that the passages were no doubt quotations from Mr.\nKiddIe's speech, which he had become cognisant of in some occult\nmanner, and which he had stored up in his mind, but that the appear-\nance of plagiarism was due to the imperfect precipitation of the letter\nby the Chela, or disciple, charged with the task. Koot Hoomi then\ngave what he asserted to be the true version of the letter as dictated\nand recovered by his own scrutiny apparently from the blurred pre-\ncipitation. In this fuller version the quoted passages were given a.~\nquotations, and mixed with controversial matter. Koot Hoomi\nexplained the peculiar form which the error of precipitation had\nassumed by saying that the quoted passages had been more distinctly\nimpressed on his own mind, by an effort of memory, than his own\ninterposed remarks; and, that inasmuch as the whole composition hacl\nbeen feebly and inadequately projected, owing to his own physical\nfatigue at the time, the high lights only, so to speak, had come out;\nthere had been many illegible passages, which the Chela had omitted.\nThe Chela, he said, wished to submit the letter to Koot Hoomi for\nrevision, but Koot Hoomi declined for want of time.\nThe weakness of this explanation was pointed out (in Ligllt) by 1\\11-.\nMassey, who showed (among other points) that the quoted sentences\nseemed to have been ingeniously twisted into a polemical sense, precisely\nopposite to that in which they were written.\nAnd more lately (in LigM, September 20tll, 1884) Mr. KiddIe lias\nshown tha.t the passage thus restored by no means comprises the whole\nDigitized by Google\n\f011 PMnomena connected 1&itI~ Theosopl,y. 207\nof the unackllowledged quotations; and, moreover, that these newly-\nindicated quotations are antecedent to those already admitted by Koot\nHoomi, and described as forming the introduction to a fresh topic of\ncriticism. The proof of a deliberate plagiarism aggravated by a.\nfictitious defence, is therefore irresistible.\nIn conclusion, it is necessary to sta.te that this is not the only\ne,idence of fraud in connection with the Theosophical Society and\nMadame Blavatsky, which the Committee had before them, priOlO to, or\nindependently of, the pUblication of the Blavatsky-Ooulomb corre-\nspondence. Mr. C. C. Massey had brought before them evidence\nwhich convinced both him and them that Madame Blavatsky had, in\n1879, arranged with a medium, then in London, to cause a \" Mahatma\"\nletter to reach him in an apparently\" mysterious\" way.) The par-\nticulars will be found at p. 397.\nIt fOl'ms no part of our duty to follow Madame Blavatsky into other\nfields. But with reference to the somewhat varied lines of activity\nwhich Mr. Hodgson's Report suggests for her, we may say that we\ncannot consider any of these as beyond the range of her powers. The\nhomage which her immediate friends have paid to her abilities has been\nfor the most part of an unconscious kind; and some of them may still be\nunwilling to credit her with mental resources which they have hitherto\nbeen so far from suspectink. For our own part, we regard her neither\nas the mouthpiece of hidden seers, nor as a mere vulgar ad~\u00b7enturess ;\nwe think that she has achieved a title to permanent remembrance as one\nof the most accomplished, ingenious, and interesting impostors in history.\n2. ACCOUNT OF PERSONAL INVESTIGATIONS IN INDIA,\nAND DISCUSSION OF THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE\n\"KOOT HOOMI\" LETTERS.\nBy RICHARD HODGSOS.\nPART I.\nIn No,\u00b7ember of last year I proceeded to India for the purpose of\ninvestigating on the spot the evidence of the phenomena connected with\nthe Theosophical Society.\nItwill be known to most of my readers that M. and Madame Coulomb,\nwho had been attached to the Theosophical Society for several years in\npositions of tlllSt, had charged Madame Blavatsky with fraud, and had\nadduct'd in support of their cbarge various letters and other documents\nalleged by them to have bep,n written by Madame Blayatsky. Some of\nthese documents were published in the Madras Christian Collp.ge\nJ\/a:Ja::illf! uf September and October, 1884, and, if genuine, ullquestion-\nDigitized by Google\n\f208 Mr. Hodgson'8 Report\nably implicated Madame Blavatsky in trickery. Madame Blavatsky,\nhowever, asserted that they were to a great extent forgeries, that at\nany rate the incriminating portions were. One of the most important\npoints, therefore, in the investigation was the determination of the\ngenuineness of these disputed documents.\nIt was also highly important to determine the competency of the\nwitnesses to phenomena, and to ascertain, if possible, the trustworthiness\nin particular of three primary witnesses, viz., Mr. Damodar K.\nMava.lankar, Mr. Babajee D. Nath, and Colonel Olcott, upon whose\ntrustworthiness the validity of the evidence which in our First Report\nwe considered pl-imA facie important, mainly depended.\nBefore proceeding it may be well for me to state that the general\nattitude which I have for years maintained with respect to \"arious\nclasses of alleged phenomena. which form the subje.!t of investigation\nby our Society enabled me, as I believe, to approach the task I bad\nbefore me with complete impartiaJity; while the conclusions which I\nheld and still hold concerning the important positive results achieved by\nour Society in connection with the phenomena of Telepathy,-of which,\nmoreover, I have had instances in my own experience, both spontaneous\nand experimental, and both as agent and percipient,-formed a further\nsafeguard of my readiness to deal with the evidence set before me\nwithout any prejudice as to the principles involved. Indeed, whatever\nprepossessions I may ha\\'e had were distinctly in favour of Occulti,;m\nand Madame Rlavatsky-a fact which, I think I may venture to say, is\nwell known to several leading Theosophists.\nDuring my three months' investigation I. was treated with\nperfect courtesy, both at the headquarters of the Theosophical Society\nand by the gentlemen connected with the Jladra8 Cltristian College\n.JIagazine. I 'thus had every opportunity of examining the witnesses\nfor the Theosophical phenomena, and of comparing in detail the disputed\ndocuments with the undoubted handwriting of Madame Blavatsky.\nAfter 0. very careful examination of the most important of these\ndocuments, and after considering the circumstantial evidence offered by\nTheosophists in proof of their being forgeries, I have come to the\nassured condusion that they are genuine.\nAnd it seems desirable here t:> mention a fact to which attelltion\nhas already been drawn by the editor of the Jfadras Christian College\n.Magazine, in his reply to an unfounded charge brought against him hy\nTheosophists, who accused the authorities of the magazine of haYIng\npublished the disputed documents without any guarantee of theil'\ngenuineness. So far was this from being the case that prior. to their\npublication of the documents they obtained the best evidence procurable\nat Madras as to the genuineness of the handwriting. There was indeed\nno professional expert in handwriting to be consulted, but the judgll1mts\nDigitized by Goo\n\f0\" PileI\/omena cOl\/nect(d lI:ith The080p1'1l. 209\nwhich were obtained included, among others, the opinions of gentlemen\n(!ualified by many years' banking experience.\nFrom these Blavatsky-Coulomb documents it a}'pears that Mahatma\nletters were prepared and sent by Madame Blavatsky, that Koot Hoomi\nis a fictitious personage, that supposed \"astral forms\" of the Mahatmas\nwere confederates of Madame Blavatsky in disguise-generally the\nCoulombs; that alleged transportation of cigarettes and other objects,\n\"integration\" of letters, and allied phenomena.-some of them in con-\nnection with the sCHl811~d Shrine at Adyar-were ingenious trickeries,\ncarried out by Mo.dame Blavatsky, with the assists.nce chiefly of the\nCoulombs.\nBut further investigations were required. Other apparently im-\nportant phenomena had come before us which were not directly\ndiscredited by the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters. Among these phenomena,\nfor example, were some appearances of Mahatmas, many instances of\nthe alleged precipits.tion of writing independently of Madame Blavatsky\nand the Coulombs; and there were alio the\" astral\" journeys of Mr.\nDamodar. Not only did these and other phenomena. require special\ninvestigation, but it was desira.ble that some confirmation should be\nobtained of the genuineness of the disputed letters-that any con-\nclusions concerning them should not depend merely and exclusively\nupon questions of style and handwriting. To this end it was necessary\nthat I should examine the important witnesses involved in the inci-\ndents mentioned in these documents. It may be added that additional\nlight was required on some of the phenomena. mentioned in \"The Occult\n'Vorld,\" and that the authorship of the K. H. letters could 110t be put\naside as not in some degree bearing on our research.\nI may now express in brief the conclusions to which I was gradually\nforced, o.fter what I believe to be a thorough survey of the evidence\nfor Theosophical phenomena.\nThe conclusion which I formet1, that as a question of handwriting\nthe disputed letters were written by Madame Blavatsky, is corrobora.ted\n1>y the results of my inquiries into the details of the related incidents.\nFor Mr. Damodar'll \"astral\" journeys I could find no additional\nevidence which rendered pre-arrangement ill any way more difficult than\nH appeared to be under the circumsts.nces narrated to us at the time of\nour First Report, when we considered that collusion between Madame\nBlavatsky and Mr. Damodar was not precluded. On the contral\u00b7Y.\nmy inquiries have revealed that pre-arrangement between ~ladame\nBlavatsky and MI'. Damodar was much easier than we then supposed.\nThe accounts gh-en by those witnesses who, we thought, might contri-\nbute valuable corroborative evidence in the way of showing that such\npre-arrangement was not possible, tended rather to show the reverse.\nThe cases, therefore, rested entirely upon the evidence of Mr.\nDigitized by Google\n\f210 M,\u00b7. Hodg8on'8 Rl'pol't\nDamodar and Madame Blavatsky. But early ill my investigation events\noccurred which impelled me towards the belief that no reliance could be\nplaced on Mr. Damodar, and after disco\\'ering the unmistakable false-\nhoods which marked hisown evidence, I could come to no other conclusion\nthan that he had co-operated with Madame Bla.vatsky in tile production\nof spurious marvels.\nI was also, for reasons that will hereafter appear, compelled to dis-\ncard altogether the evidence of Mr. Babajee D. Nath, who appeared to\nus at the time of our First Report to be a primary witness for the\nordinary physical existence of the Mahatmas.\nThe testimony of Colonel Olcott himself I found to be funda,..\nmentally at variance with fact in so many important points that it\nbecame impossible for me to place the slightest value upon the evidence\nhe had offered. ~ut in saying this I do not mean to suggest any doubt\nas to Colonel Olcott's honesty of purpose.\nIn short, my lengthy examinations of the numerous array of\nwitnesses to the phenomena showed that they were, as a body,\nexcessively credulous, excessively deficient in the powers of common\nobservation,-a.nd too many of them prone to supplement that deficiency\nby culpable exaggeration.\nNevertheless, I refrained as long as possible from pronouncing even\nto myself any definite conclusion on the subject, but after giving the\nfullest consideration to the statements made by the Theosophic witnesses,\nafter a careful inRpection both of the present headquarters of the Theo-\nsophical Society in l\\Iadras and of the old headquarters in Bombay,\nwhel't! so many of the alleged phenomena occurred, I finally had no\ndoubt whatever that the phenomena. connected with the Theosophical\nSociety were part of a huge fraudulent system worked by Madame\nBlavatsky with the assistance of the Coulombs and several other\nconfederates, and that not a single genuine phenomenon could be found\namong them all. And I may add that though, of course, I have not,\nin coming to this conclusion, trusted to any unverified statements of\nthe Coulombs, still neither by fl'6<}uent cross-examination nor by inde-\npendent invest.igation of their statements wherever circumstances per-\nmitted, have I been able to break down any allegatiol1s of theirs which\nwere in any way material.\nIt is needless for me to enter into all the minutire of so complicated\nII.n im\u00b7estigation. It would in truth be impossible either to reproduce\nall the palterings and equivocations in the evidence offered to me, or to\ndescribe with any approach to adequacy how my personal impressions\nof many of the witnesses deepened my conviction of the dishonesty\nwoven throughout their testimony. What follows, however, will, I\nthink, be more than enough to convince any impartial inquirer of the\njustice of the conclusion which I have reached.\nDigitized by Google\n\f0\" Phenomena connected witl, The08oph!l. 211\nI begin by giving some extracts from the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters\nwhich will justify the assertions which I have made above concerning\nthe contents of these documents.

It\nseems clear from the second portion of the above extract that the Shrine\nwould not bear examination, that there was some secret construction ill\nconnection with it of which Oolonel Olcott was ignorant, and which he\nmust have no opportunity of discovering. Madame Ooulomb states that\n\" luna melanconica\" here means the opening at the 'btlck of the Shrinp.\nHence, in case Colonel O]cott should return to Madras before Machme\nBlavatsky, the key of the Shrine was to be concealed. The passage is a\nDigitized by Google\n\fOl~ Phenomena connected tcith Tlu08ophy. 217\ntestimonial to Colonel Olcott's honesty, though perhaps hardly to his\nperspicacity.\nOne of the first points to ascertain with regard to these letters is\nwhether Madame Blavatsky did treat M. and Madame Coulomb\nwith the complete confidence which their tone throughout implies.\nPlenty of evidence could he adduced to show that they were treated\nwith confidence both by Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, and\nthat they held positions of trust (M. Coulomb being Librarian and\nMadame Coulomb being Assistant Corresponding Secretary of the\nSociety); but it is, I think, sufficiently proved by the fact that when\nMadame Blavatsky was at Ootacamulld, in 1883, Madame Coulomb\nhad charge of the keys of the Shrine; and that when Madame\nBlavatsky and Colonel Olcott left Madras to come to Europe in\nFebruary, 1884, M. and Madame Coulomb were left in complete\ncha.rge of Madame Blavatsky's rooms. Further evidence may be found\nin a letter of Colonel Olcott, quoted (with some omissions not specified\nby Dr. Hartmann) in Dr. Hartmann's pamphlet, \"Report of observa-\ntiCAU\/ made during a nine months' stay at tlte Headquarters of the Theo-\nsophical Society,\" pp. 36, 37 ; and in anoth..r letter from Colonel Olcott,\nwhich I have seen, from which it appears that he had wished 1\\1.\nCoulomb to be a member of the Board of Control of the Theosophical\nSociety. Moreover, Madame Blavatsky herself spoke of Madame Cou-\nlomb in Indian newspapers, of 1880, as \"a lady guest of mine,\" and\nas \"an old friend of mine whom I had known 10 years ago at Cairo,\"\nand by admitting nearly all the non-incriminating portions of the\nBlavatsky-Coulomb documents to be in substance genuine, clearly proves\nthat she was in the habit of addressing Madame Coulomb in a very\nfamiliar tone.\nI may now procood to show, in one or two instances, what evidence\nthere is apart from the style and handwriting of the letters tending to\nestablish their genuineness.\nI will begin with number 1, relating to the Sassoon telegram. The\nmatter is rather complicated, and the details of my invpst!gation are\ngiven in Appendix I. Here I will briefly state the results. ( Firstly, it\nbecame clear to me from conversations with Messrs. A D. 'and M. D.\nEzekiel, who spent much time with Madame Blavatsky during her visit at.\nPoona in October, 1883, and from the written statement of Mr. N. D.\nKhandalmla., in whose house she stayed, that the actual circumstances\nduring her stay there were quite consistent with the letter. Secondly,\nI have been unahle to obtain any trustworthy evidence for the ex.istence\nof such a person as Ramalinga Deb, who was represented by Madam\u20ac'\nBlavatskyas a Chela, residing in Madras, of the Mahatma with wholll\nshe professed to be in occult communication. Thirdly, a careful COlll-\nparison of Madame Blavatsky's attempt to disprove the genuineness of\nQ\nDigitized by Goo\n\f218 Mr. Hodgson\" !lpport\nthis letter (see Appendix I.) with the statemElnts of Messrs. Ezekiel\nand Khandalvala appears to me to strengthen the case against her; for\nit IMds us to the conclusion that she must have made a I!pecific pre-\narrangement for a conversation, the whole point of which was that its\nsuqject should have arisen extempore.\nI proceed to extracts (2) (3) and (4).\nThe Coulombs assert that a certain saucer was, according to\nagreement between Madame Blavatsky and Madame Coulomb, to be\n\" accidentally\" broken and the pieces placed in the Shrine, arrangements\nbeing made.for the substitution, through the secret back of the Shrine,\nof another similar saucer, unbroken, in lieu of the broken pieces. (2)\n(3) and (4) they say, referred to this; letter (3) enclosed a slip pro-\nyided for the occasion, and (4) suggests that the phenomenon should\noccur for the edification of General Morgan.\nNow, it is not disputed that the so-called \"saucer phenomenon\"\ndid occur in the presence of General Morgan. The only question is\nwhether it was pre-a.rra.nged, and if so, how it was performed. Here is\nGeneral Morgan's own account of it, published in the Supplement to tho\nTheosophist for December, 1883.\nIn the month of August, having occasion to come to Madras in the\nabsence of Colonel Olcott and Madame Blavatsky, I visited the head-\nquarters ofthe TheoBOphical Society to see a wonderfulpainting of theltfahat-\nIna Koot Hoomi kept there in a Shrine and daily a.ttended to by the Chelaa.\nOn arrival at the hOUie I W88 told that the lady, Madame Coulomb, who had\ncharge of the keys of the Shrine, W88 absent, so I awaited her return. She\ncame home in about an hour, and we proceeded up stairs to open the Shrine\nand impect the picture. Madame Coulomb advanced quickly to unlock the\ndouble doors of the hanging cupboard, and hurriedly threw them open. In 80\ndoing she had failed to observe that a china tray inside was on the edge of\nthe Shrine and leaning againlli one of the doors, and when they were opened,\ndown fell the china tray, sm88tted to pieces on the hard 'chunam floor. Whilst\nMadame Coulomb W88 wringing her hands and lamenting this unfortunate\naccident to a val'uable article of Madame Blavatsky's, and her husband was\non his knees collecting the tUbri&, I remarked it would be neceuary to obtain\nsome china cement and thus try to restore the fragments. Thereupon\nM. Coulomb W88 despatched for the same. The broken pieceswere carefully\ncollected and placed, tied in a cloth,within the Shrine, and the doors locked.\nMr. DamodarK. Mavalankar, the Joint Recording Secretary of the Society,\nwas opposite the Shrine, seated on a chair, about 10 feet away from it,\nwhen, after BOme conversation, anidea occurred to me to which !immediately\ngave expression. I remarked that if the Brothers comidered it of sufficient\nimportance, they would ea.aily restore the broken article ; if not, they would\nleave it to the culprits to do so, t.he best way they could. Five minutes had\nscarcclyelapsed after this remark when l\\{r. Damodar, who during this timo\nBeemed wrapped in a roverie-exclaimed, \"I think there is an answer.\" The\ndoors were opened, and sure enough, 0. small note W88 found 011 the shelf\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Pllenomena connected fEitl. Theo8ophy. 219\nof the Shrin~n opening which we read' \"To the small audience present.\nMadame Coulomb has occasion to assure herself that the devil is neither so\nblack nor so wicked as he is generally represented; the mischief is easily\nrepaired.\"\nOn opening the cloth the china tray was found to be whole and perfect ;\nnot a trace of the breakage to be found on it! I at once wrote acroBB tho\nnote, stating that I was present when the tray was broken and immediately\nrestored, dated and signed it, so there should be no mistake in the matter.\nIt may be here observed that Madame Coulomb believes that the many things\nof a wonderful nature that occur at the headquarters, may be the work of the\ndevil-hence the playful remark of the Mahatma who came to her rescue.*\nIt will be seen that there is nothing in this account inconsistent\nwith \"Madame Coulomb's assertion. Moreover, it is a very suspicious\ncircumstance that the china tray should have been \"leaning against\none of the doors.\" This is not the position naturally assumed by a.\nsaucer put into a cupboard in the ordinary way through the doors.\nThe whole\" saucer\" found in the Shrine was shown to me at Adyar\nat my request. I examined it carefully, and I also examined carefully\nthe broken pieces of the saucer which Madame Coulomb exhibited as\nthose for which the whole saucer had been substituted. The two\n\"saucers .. manifestly formed a pai~ The incident happened in August,\n1883. Madame Coulomb alleged tluit she purchased the pair of so-called\n\" saucers .. at a shopt in Madras for 2 rupees 8 annaa each. On inquiry\nI found that\" two porcelain pin trays\" (words which properly describe\nthe so-called \"saucers \") were purchased at this shop by cash sale on\nJuly 3rd, 1883, and that Madame Coulomb had made purchases at\nthe shop on that date. If taken as referring to this purchase there was\none Blight inaccura.cy in Madame Coulomb's account; inasmuch as she\nsaid the \"trays\" cost 2 rupees 8 annnas each, instead of 2 rupees 8\nannaa the pair.\nAn incident somewhat similar to the foregoing is related in\nAppendix III. .\nIt will be seen that in order to explain the \"saucer phenomenon\"\nby ordinary human agency, we require to suppose that there was a.\nsecret opening at the back of the Shrine. It was important, therefore,\nto ascertain what ground there was for this supposition, apart from\nthe Blavatsky-Coulomb letters, in which its existence is clearly implied_\nI now proceed to give the result of my investigations in this direction_\nTHE SHRINE (se~ Plan, following p. 380).\nOn my a.rrival at the headquarters of the Theosophical Society, on\nDecember 18th, 188.4, I was info~ed by Mr. Damodar that he could\n\u2022 A later and longer account, intended by General Morgan to prove that\nthere could have been no deception, will be found in Appendix II.\nt M.

Colonel Olcott had left\nthe headquarters some days previously in order to meet Madame\nBlavatsky at Ceylo11 on her retunl from Europe. Two days later\nMadame Blavatsky had reached Adyar, and I again requested\npermission to examine the Shrine. Madame Blavatsky professed\nignorance on the subject, saying she had been unable to discover what\nhad been done with the Shrine. Mr. Damodar and Dr. Hartmann both\ndenied having any knowledge of it, and it was only after repeated\nand urgent requests to be told what had happened that I learnt\nfrom the halting account given by Mr. Damodar and Dr. Hartmann that\nthe Shrine bad been moved from the Occult Room (see Plan) into\nMr. Damodar's room at about mid-day of September 20th, that on the\nfollowing morning, at 9 o'clock, they found the Shrine had been taken\naway, and they had not seen it since. They threw out suggestions\nimplying that the Coulombs or the missionaries might have stolen it.\n}Ioreover, the Occult Room, when I first received permission to\ninspect it, had been considerably altered; its walls were covered with\nfresh plaster, and I was informed by Mr. Damodar that all traces of\nthe alleged \" machinations\" of the Coulombs in connection with the\nShrine had heen obliterated. This was not true, for the bricked frante and\nthe aperture iuto the recess still existed (see p. 228). However, under\nthe circumstances it was impossible for me to test the accuracy of\nmuch of the description given by Theosophists of the Occult Room and\nthe Shrine at the time of the \"exposure\" by the Coulombs. But by\nanalysing and comparing the evidence given by various witnesses, I\nwas able to put together the following history of the Shrine and its\nsurroundings.*\nOn December 19th, 1882, Adyar became the headquarters of the\nTheosophical Society. One large upper room of the main bungalow was\nused by l\\Iadame Blavatsky (see Plan). The Occult Roomwas built later.\nagainst the west side of Madame Blavatsky's room. The north window\non this side was removed, and a layer of bricks and plaster covered the\naperture on the side of the Occult Room-a recess about 15in. deep\nbeing left on the east side. The south window was transformed into 3\ndoorway leading from Mach.me BlaTatsky's room into the Occult Room_\nMadame Blavatsky's large room was divided into two by curtains and a\nscreen; that adjoining the Occult Room being used by Madame\nBlavatskyas her bedroom, and at the end of 1883 as her dining-room\nalso. The accompanying rough sketch made from measurements of my\n(IWU shows the positions, the Occult Room being about 2ft. lower\ntha.n Madame Blavatsky's room. The general entrance to the Occult\nto For the evidence on which this account is based, see Appendix n-.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOJ, Phenomena connected feif\/, Thc080pllll. 221\nRoom was through Madame Blavatsky's sitting-room. The Shrine, as\nI gather from comparing the accounts of different Theosophists, was a\nwooden cupboard between 3ft. and 4ft. in width and height,\nand 1ft. or 15in. in depth, with a drawer below the cupboard\nportion, and with comer brackets. The Shrine was made with\nthree sliding panels at the back.* It was placed against that\nportion of the wall in the Occult Room where the north window of\nMadame Blavatsky's room had previously existed (see Plan), covering\nmost of that portion, a most unfortunate position to choose for it if\nthere was no fraudulent intention. It rested below on a plank or shelf,\nbut its chief support consisted of two thick iron wires which\nwere attached to two hooks near the ceiling. A certain space round\nthe Shrine was enclosed by muslin curtains, which were drawn\naside from the front when anyone wished to approach the Shrine.\nThese curtains were about 7ft. high on the sides, but on the wall\nbP.hind the Shrine extended nearly to the ceiling. The wall immediately\nbehind the Shriue was covered by white glazed calico, tacked to the\nwall. Two widths Clf the calico met in a vertical line passing behind\nthe centre of the Shrine. The remaining part of the walls of the\nOccult Room was covered with red-a.nd-white striped calico tacked to\nthe wall. The upper part of the Shrine was as close to the wall itself\nas the muslin and calico behind it would allow. The lower part of the\nShrine was near to the wall, at a distance from it differently\nestimated by different witnesses, but which must have been some-\nwhere between lin. and liin., and was probably very little, if at\nall, more than iill. The Shrine aud its appurtenances were fixed\nin February or March, 1883. Shortly afterwards a four-panelled\nwooden boarding was placed in Madame Blavatsky's room, at the back\nof the recess. For some time an a1mirah (cupboard) stood in front\nof this recess. The exact dates of the placing of the boarding and\nalmirah and of the removal of the almirah I have not been able to\nascertain. The almirah, and afterwards the recess, were used by\nMadame Blavatsky as a closet for hanging clothes. The above is put\ntogether from the statements of Theosophic witnesses.\nM. Coulomb states that he removed the Shrine just aftel\u00b7 it\nwas originally placed against the wall, sawed the middle pallel in two,\nand attached a piece Qf leather behind to serve as a handle, so that the\ntop portion could be easily pulled up. The junction between the two\n\u2022 This was admitted to me by ?rIa.da.me Blantsky herself, who alleged that\nthe Shrine was 80 made in order that it might be more easily taken to pieces\nand packed in case of removal. But the rest of the Shrine appears to have\nbeen of solid construction, and it is difficult to see what great convenience\nfor travelling purposes there could have been in merely taking out portions of\nthe back.\nDigitized by Google\n\f222 Mr. Hoduao,.'a Report\nhalves of the panel was, he says, hidden from those looking at the\ninside of the Shrine, hy a mirror which just covered it. Behind this\nsliding panel a hole was made in the wall. A sliding panel was also\nmade in the wardrobe which stood in front of the recess in Madame Bla-\nvatsky's bedroom, and one of the panels of the teak-wood boarding was\nalso made to slide about 10 inches, so that easy communication existed\nbetween Madame Blavatsky's bedroom and the Shrine. The panels in\nthe wardrobe and in the teak-wood door were shown by M. Coulomb to\nthe Board of Oontrol when he gave up the keys of Madame Blavatsky's\nrooms in May, 1884. The hole in the wall, he said, had been blocked\nup in January, before Madame Blavatsky departed for Europe. He\nstates also that the two portions of the middltl panel of the Shrine were\nreplaced by a new single panel, and that these changes were made at the\nrequest of Madame Blavatsky, who was afraid that some examination\nmight be made of the Shrine during her absence in Europe. 1\\1.\nCoulomb's statement as to the half panel cannot of course be verified,\nand must be taken for what it is worth. What evidence there is in\nsupport of his other statements will be seen from the remainder of my\nnarrative, derived from other sources.\nAt the end of October or beginning of November, 1883, Madame\nBlavatsky, in consequence of a doubt expressed by Mr. G.--* con-\ncerning the panelled boarding connected with the Shrine, ordert'd\nit to be removed, t and the front part of the recess, that towards\nMadame Blavatsky's bedroom, to be blocked up. The panelled boarding\nwas placed on the outside of the north-east opening into Madame\nBlavatsky's drawing-room, and formed the back of a shelf, and there it\nwas certainly found to have a sliding panel in it when examined by the\nTheosophists in May, 1884. t A wooden frame of about 8ft. by 4ft.\nwas made, with cross-pieces, so as to fit the front of the recess.\nA single layer of half-size bricks was placed in this frame, a.nd\nthe front then covered with plaster, so that it was lIush with the\nadjoining wall. The hollow left in the wall between Madame Blavatsky's\nroom and the Occult Room, was about 1ft. deep. The whole wall was\nthen papered over, the work being completed about the middle of\nDecember, 1883, or Pflrhaps several days later. Directly afterwards a\nsidebo!lrd, about 3ft. high and 34m. wide, was placed close against the\nbricked frame forming part of t\u00b7he papered wall. It covered the lowest\nnorth partition of the frame, and it was found on the expulsion of tlle\nCoulombs in May, 1884,that the bricks from this partition had been taken\nout, so that there was communication through the sideboard (in the back\n\u2022 See Appendix Y.\nt See Mrs. Morgan's eddence in Appendix IY.\nt For a case where this panel seems to have been used in the new position.\nsee Appendix VI.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOla Pkenomena connected witl. Theosoph!l. 223\nof which was a. hinged panel) with the hollow space. M. Coulomb\nstates that he removed the bricks as .soon as the sideboard was in\nposition in December, 1883. However this may be, the sideboard\nremained there during the time of the anniversary celebration in 1883 ;\nand Shrin~phenomena, which were in abeyance during these alterations,\nbegan again immediately after their completion. They ceased altogether,\nwith two exceptions to be afterwards dealt with (see p. 248), about or\nshortly before the middle of January, 1884. On May 17th or 18th, M.\nCoulombgave up the keys, and the various contrivances for trickery were\ninvestigated. The sliding panel in the almirah, the sliding panel in\nthe boarding, the hinged panel at the back of the sideboard, the opening\nbehind it where the bricks had been removed, and the hollow space of\nthe recess were all inspected. Mr. St. George La.n~Fox then examined\nthe west side of the party-wall behind the Shrine, but was unable at\nthat time to find any traces of the hole which, according to M. Cou-\nlomb, had previously existed between the hollow space and tho Shrine.\nHe also examined the sideboard, and found that he could discover no\nsignsfrom without of the aperture which led into the hollow space, show-\ning that this aperture would remain undetected unless examination of the\nsideboard were made from within. The Theosophists contended that the\nstructures for trickery revealed by the Coulombs, who had had exclusive\ncharge of Madame Blavatsky's rooms during her absence, had been made\nafter she had left; that they had never been and could not be used in the\nproductionofphenomena;- that the hollowspace and the apertore leading\nto it were too small to be utilised in any connection with the Shrine, and\nmoreover that M. Coulomb's work was interrupted before he had time to\nmake a hole through the wall between the hollow space and the Shrine\nitself.\nTo establish these points, the Theosophical Board of Control sent\nround a circular inquiry in August, 1884, to various Theosophists who\nhad been at headquarters, requesting them to state what they knew of\nthe condition of the Shrine, adjoining walls, &c.,'prior to and after the\nexpUlsion of the Coulombs. I was allowed by Dr. Hartmann to read\nthe packet of replies to this inquiry. I also questioned in detail all the\nimportant witnesses who professed to have mooe an examination of the\nShrine and its surroundings ;-the result being that if we except\nMadame Blavatsky and the Coulombs, Madame Blavatsky's native\nservant Babula, and Colonel Olcott (whose statement on tllis point I\ndistrust for reasons given ~ Appendix IV. where it is quoted), there\n\u2022 One ground given for this opinion \"'as that the sliding panels worke(l\nstiftly, as if new and unused. Disuse for a few months, or a little pit, would, I\nhink, account for this fact. See comments on the evidence of Mr. J. D. B.\nGribble, Appendix IV.\nDigitized by Google\n\f224 M,'. IIodg8on'8 Report\nis no evidcnce to show that any person ever removed the Shrine from\nthe wall or saw it removed from the wall after it was first placed there,\nuntil the expUlsion of the Coulombs; that, therefore, no careful examina-\ntion could ever have been made of the Lack of the Shrine or of the wall\nin immediate juxtaposition. Further, that no such exawination was\never made of the east side of the party-wall as would have sufficed to\ndiscover the sliding panels and apertures. I must add that the\ntestimony offered appeared to me to be characterised by much mal-\nobserYation, sometimes implying a ludicrous lack of ordinary intelligence,\nand much equivocation sometimes amounting to absolute dishonesty.\nSeveral of the original statements of the witnesses are given in Appendix\nIV., together with modifications of their testimony produced by my\nquestioning, and further comments of my own.\nThe ultimate fa.te of the Shrine,according to a statement made by Dr.\nHartmann to Mr. and Mrs. Cooper-Oakley, Mr. Hume, and myself, was\nas follows. After the expulsion of the Coulombs, Mr. Judge, anAmerican\nTheosophist, then residing at the headquarters of the Society, was desirous\nof examining the Shrine. Mr. Damodar, who possessed the keys of the\nOccult Room, avoided this examination several times on one pretext or\nanother; but, eventually, a party of Theosophists proceeded to the inspec-\ntion of the Shrine. The Shrine was removed from the wall and its doors\nwere opened. Mr. T. Vigiaraghava Charloo, (commonly called Ananda)\na Theosophist residing in an official position at the headquarters, struck\nthe back of the Shrine with his hand, exclaiming, \"You see, the back\nis quite solid,\" when, to the surprise of most of those who were prp.sent,\nthe middle panel of the Shrine flew up. It seemed undesirable to some\nof the witnesses of this phenomenon that the discovery should be made\npublic, and they resolved accordingly to destroy the Shrine. To do\nthis they considered that the Shrine must be surreptitiously removed, but\nsuch removal was inconvenient from the Occult Room. The Shrine was\ntherefore first removed openly to Mr. Damodar's room, and, on the\nfollowing night, was thence remo,-ed secretly by three Theosophists,\nconce~led in the compound, afterwards broken up, and the frag-\nments burned piecemeal during the follo'wing week. Dr. Hartmann\nhad only retained two portions of the back of the Shrine,\nwhich he had enveloped in brown paper and kept carefully con-\ncealed in his room,-substantial pieces of cedar wood, black-\nlacked. It was of such wood, according to a previous statement of\nlI. Coulomb, that the back of the Shrine was made.\nDr. Hartmann has since furnished me with a statement in writing\nwhich is of interest as affording evidence respecting the hole between\nthe recess and thc Shrine. That this hole had manifestly\nexisted and had been blocked up, I had been assured by\nanother Theosophist who is particularly observant, and who discovered\nDigitized by Goo\n\fO\/~ Pnetlomena connected ,citn Thto8opliy. 225\nits traces independently of Dr. Hartmann. The following is an extract\nfrom Dr. Hartmann's written account:-\nAt what time the hole in the wall was made is as much a mystery to me\nas it is to you; but from a consideration of all the circumstances as laid down\nin my pamphlet, I came to the conclusion, and am atill of the opinwll, that\nthey were made by M. Coulomb after H. P. Blavatsky went to Europe,\nand I am now inclined to believe that M. Coulomb made them to ingratiate\nhimself with Madame Blavatsky to facilitate her supposed tricks. All the\ntraps are too clumsy, and it would tax the utmost credulity to believe\nthat such phenomena as I know of could have been made by their mean&\nIn fact I do not know of a single phenomena [sic] tiKIt happened ill my\npresence where they would have been of the slightest use.\nOf the existence of a movable back to the Shrine and a filled-up\naperture in the wall, none of us knew anything, and although superficial\nexaminations were made, they divulged nothing; because to make a\nthorough examination, it would have been neceBBBry to take the Shrine\ndown, and we were prevented from doing this by the superstitious awo with\nwhich Mr. Damodar K. Mavalankar regarded the Shrine, and who looked\nupon every European who dared to touch or handle the .. sacred\" Shrine as\na desecration.\nAt about the time when Major-General Morgan sent his in\\'itation to\nMr. Patterson to come to headquarters, that examination was made, and it;\nwas found that the back of the Shrine could be removed, and on 1110isten-\ning the wall behind the Shrine with a wet cloth, it was found that an aperture\nhad existed, which had been plastered up.\nWhy these discoveries should have thrown any discredit 011 Madame\nBlavatsky I cannot see, because they as well as the other traps were the\nwork of M. Coulomb, and there was no indication whatever that H. P.\nBlavatsky knew anything of their existence, and moreover the testimonials\nof such as claimed to have examined the Shrine went to show that they were\nof recent origin.\nNeverthelesa, I must cOllfesa that it seemed to me that if at that in\u00b7\nopportune moment this lIew discotle1\u00b7V, to which I then alluded in the papers\n(see MadrlU MaU), would have been made public, it would 11ave had a bad\neffect on the public mind. If I had been here as a delegate of the Society\nfor Psychical Research, or as a detective of the misaionaries, I would,\nperhaps, not have hesitated to state the exact nature of the neue discovery j\nbut in my position I had to look out for the interests of Madame Blavatsky,\nand I did not, therefore, consider it prudent to speak of this discovery;\nneither was I authorised to do so, neither did I (as I then stated) feel justified\nin letting the enemics of H. P. Blavatsky invade her private 1'00111S With-\nout her consent.\nA gentleman who was present, and who shared my opinions, was of the\nopinion that the Skritu: had been too much desecrated to be of any more use,\nand he burned the Shrine in my presence. . \u2022 . I never told Colonel\nOlcott nor Madame Blavatsky, nor any une else at headquarters up to that\ntime, what had become of the Shrine. But when you and MI'. Hume,\nbesides a lot of other absurd theories, also asserted your conviction, that\nMadame Blavatsky had sent her servant, Baboola, for the purpose of doing\nDigitized by Google\n\f226 MI\". Hodgson's R6port\naway with tbe Shrine, and that he had done 80 by her ordera, 1 thought it\nabout time to show you that even a member of the Society for Psychical\nResearch may err in his judgment.\nWe learn from Dr. Hartmann that any thorough examination of\nthe Shrine was prevented by the\" superstitious awe\" with which Mr.\nDamodar regarded it. Dr. Hartmann's assertion is corroborated by\nthe testimony of Mr. Lane-Fox, who has &lso very emphatically\nexpressed to me his conviction that no examination of the Shrine by\nnative witnesses can be considered as of the smallest v&lue, in\nconsequence of the exceeding reverence in which it was universally\nheld. But it will be observed that .in one part of his account Dr.\nHartmann appears to lay some stress on \"the testimonials of such\nas claimed to have examined the Shrine.\" Dr. Hartmann himself,\nindeed, was one of those\" who claimed to have examined the Shrine\"\nbefore the exposure; he gave me, on different occasions, accounts\nof his examinations, and these accounts, besides being inconsistent\nwith one another, are inconsistent with his final statements,--as he\nat once cheerfully admitted, retracting all his previous utterances\noo~~~ .\nIt seems clear from a.ll I have said (1) that the position\nselected for the Shrine was peculiarly convenient for obtaining secret\naccess to it from the back; and that none of the changes from time to\ntime made in Madame Blavatsky's bedroom behind the Shrine, though\nmade with the ostensible object of removing all suspicion of trickery,\ntended to diminish this convenience; (2) that there undoubtedly wertl all\nthe necessary apertures for access to the Shrine from the back, at some\nperiod before the Coulombs left; (3) that there is no trustworthy evi-\ndence whatever to show that this access did not exist during the whole\ntime from the moment the Shrine was put up till Madame Blavatsky\nleft for Europe, in February, 1884, except during the alterations con-\nnected with putting up the bricked frame, when Mrs. Morgan saw the\nwhole wall papered over; and there is no evidence of the occurrence of\nany Shrine phenomena during those alterations.\nThese results-altogether apa.rt from the Blavatsky-Coulomb\ncorrespondence-would prevent the whole mass of testimony to Shrine-\nmarvels from having any scientific value; taken along with this\ncorrespondence, they can, I think, leave no doubt in the mind of any\nimpartial reader, as to the mode of production of these marvels.\nMR. DAMoDAR's EVIDENCE.\nI now come to the question as to what weight can be attached to\nthe statements of Mr. Damodar K. Mavalankar. This is a fundamen-\ntally important question, not only because he is one of the few persons\nDigitized by Google\n\fOil PileI\/omena contlected 1&,111 Theosopli!l. 227\nbesides Madame Blavatsky who testify to having seen the Mahatmas in\nThibet, and in a way which precludes the possibility of his having been\ndeceived, but also because M:r. Damodar himself is said to have the\npower of travelling in the\" astral form,\" and the reality of these\nastral journeys of his depends mainly on his own statements. My own\nconclusion, as I have said, is decidedly unfavourable to the trust-\nworthiness of Mr. Damodar. It is not in my pOwer to reproduce here\nthe whole of my grounds for forming this conclusion, but I think that a\nmere analysis of his statements regarding the Shrine will go far to\njustify it.\nBabula, the native ilervant of Madame Blavatsky, had reached\nAdyar on his return from Europe at 9 p.m., on September 20th, as I\nfound from a written entry in the Visitors' Book. My original con-\njecture as to the disappearance of the Shrine was that Babula hacl\nconcealed or destroyed it in compliance with instructions from\nMadame Blavatsky, as it was on the night of September 20th that the\nremoval of the Shrine had been effected. This appears also to have\nbeen the opinion of Mr. Subba Row, pleader in the High Court of\nlIadras, at that time and still a leading Theosophist, who vainly\nquestioned and threatened Babula in the hope of inducing a confession.\nI am disposed to think that this was also the opinion of Mr. Damodar.\nand that it was in order to prevent me from drawing the same conclusion,\nthat in reply to my inquiries at an early stage of the investigation,\nhe endeavoured to conceal the fact that Babula had arrived on the\nevening of September 20th; saying that he had arrived on the\nmorning of September 21st, and had immediately requested that he\nmight inspect the rooms, when, to the surprise of all (not, apparently,\nexcluding the three Theosophists who, according to Dr. Hartmann,\u00b7\nhad been concerned in its removal), the Shrine could not be found.\nMr. Damodar also asserted that marks were discerned on the partition\nof the room where the Shrine had been placed, as though the Shrine\nhad been lifted over the side, and that statements to this effect were\nin the deposition made at the time by those Theosophists who discovered\nthat the Shrine had disappeared. Inquiring of another Theosophist\nwho had been present, I was assured by him that no such marks were\nobserved, and that in fact none had been looked for. The deposition,\nof which I have 0.. copy, contains not the slightest allusion to any such\nmarks.\n* Dr. Hartmann stated that }lr. Damodar was not one of these three.\nThat they should not take him into confidence in the matter is natural, as they\nprobably sincerely believed in the\" superstitious awe\" with which he regarded\nthe Shrine, and thought th\"t it would lead him to disapprove of their pro-\nceedings.\nDigitized by Google\n\f228 MI'. Hodg8on'8 Report\n( Turning now to the specific statements of Mr. Damodar, quoted in\nAppendix IV., we find that he makes the following assertions :-\n1. That the sideboard aperture leading to the recess, and the recess\nitself, were so small that he could enter the hole with diffi-\nculty, and when once insidt.>, \"could only stand abreast,\nwithout being able to move either wayan inch, or to lift up \"\nhis hand.\n2. That there was no sliding-panel to the frame of the Shrine.\n3. That he was present on several occasions when various witnesses\nto the phenomp.na \"had scrutinised carefully, in every\npossible way, the Shrine, and had satisfied themselves that it\nwas intact, and had no panels or anything of the kind.\"\n4. That he well remembers Mr. Subba Rowand himself\" very\ncarefully examining the Sllrineand the Wall,\" and that they\nwere\" both satisfied that they were intact.\"\n5. That the keys of the Shrine and the Occult Room were in his\ncharge while Madame Blavatsky was at Ootacamund, in.\n1883: and again\n6. That the keys of Madame Blavatsky's rooms and of the Shrine\nwere in the charge of Madame Coulomb, while Madl\u00a3Dle\nBlavatsky was at Oota.camund in 1883.\n7. That the sideboard did not come into existence till January,\n1884, wfen the phenomena were no longer produced in the\nShrine. )\n(1) Now, with respect to the sideboard aperture and the recess,\nthese were, as I afterwards found, still in existence when I arrived_\nat Adyar, though Mr. Damodar stated to me that the recess had\nbeen blocked up. This last statement of Mr. Damodar's I can\nregard only as 0. deliberate misrepresentation. Had I known that\nthe recess still existed, I should of course myself have endeavoured\nto enter, and should at once have discovered the untruth of\nJ-Ir. Damodar's account of his own entrance. I was afterwards\ninformed by another Theosophist that' he regarded the aperture\nand the recess as quite large enough to be used by 0. person of\nordinary size for the production of the Shrine phenomena., and\nin the meantime I had tested the accuracy, or rather, inaccuracy\nQf Mr. Damodar's account, by constructing for myself an aperture\n;md a recess smaller than those connected with the Shrine.\nDr. Hartmann, in his pamphlet, gave the dimensions of the\nnperture as 27in. high by I4in. wide, and these dimensions are as\nnearly as possible correct. This I was subsequently able to ascertain\nfor myself, as the frame had been stowed away in the compound,\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Phenomena connected ffith Theosoph!l. 229\nand was shown to me by another Theosophist. The recess was\nalleged by Dr. Hartmann to be about 12in. deep, and about\noft. high; the dE!pth given is about correct, but the height\nwas more nearly 8ft.-as I found by measurement. I have myself\nentered II. space through a hole the dimensions of both of\nwhich were at least an inch- less than the dimensions given by Dr.\nHartmann. The hole I made for the purpose measured less than\n13in. by 26in., and the space into which it led, and in which I stood\nupright, was less than lliu. in depth. In this space I could with ease\nlift my hand, manipulate objects, and utilise the position generally in\nthe way demanded for the production of the Shrine phenomena. l\\Ir.\nDamodar draws attention in his account to his own thinness and leanness~\nand certainly my own organism is considerably larger than Mr.\nDamodar's, and I believe also than M. Coulomb's or Babula's.\n(2) Mr. Damodar's next assertion, that there was no sliding pane)\nto the frame of the Shrine, we have already seen to be untrue. Had\nthis statement -stood alone, however, it could not ha\\-e been regarded\nas implicating Mr. Damodar in any falsehood, but would merely have-\nappeared to be a hasty inference from his experience, as the assertion\nwas made before the discovery of the sliding panel by Ananda, as\ndescribed above.\n(3) The careful scrutiny of the Shrine \"in every possible way,\"\nwhich he asserts was made in his presence, was never made. In n()\nsingle instance was the Shrine moved in the least degree from the wall\nby any of these various witnesses to whom he refers. Not only so, but\nMr. Damodar afterwards admitted that he never examined the back of\nthe Shrine himself, and was never present when any such examination\nwas made. This appeared in connection with his statement that Mr.\nSubba Rowand himself \"very carefully\" examined the Shrine and\nthe wall.\n(4) I took an opportunity in Mr. Damodar's presence of questioning\nMr. Subba Row concerning this alleged examination. Mr. Subba. Row\ndenied that he had ever made any examination of the Shrine. Mr.\nDamodar then made a similar denial, and both again united in\naffirming that they had never seen the Shrine removed. Yet this\nimaginary examination by Mr Subba Rowand himself, Mr. Damodar\ndeclal'ed in a. previous written statement that he well remembered.\n(5) and (6) The next marked contradiction in Mr. Damodar's state-<\nments, is that when Madame Blavatsky was at Oota.ca.mund in 1883.\nthe keys of the Shrine and the Occult Room were in his charge.\nand yet were in the charge of Madame Coulomb. This contra-\ndiction is not easily resolved, but an explanation of it can be-\nsuggested. The first statement was made on August 19th, 1884-,\nwhen Mr. Damodar probably deemed it to be of capital import-\nDigitized by Google\n\f230 Mr. Hodgson's Report\nance that he should prove that there was no panel in the Shrine\nbefore the middle of September, 1883. The second statement was\nmade on September 19th, 1884, and on September 10th the Madras\nChriseian College Magazine had appeared, in which various Blavatsky-\nCoulomb letters were published. An attempt was then made on the\nside of the Theosophists to show from circumstantial evidence that\nthese letters must be forgeries. Of these letters, two very import.a.nt\nones referred respectively to the Adyar Saucer and to a Shrine letter\nreceived by Mr. P. Sreenevas Rao. In General Morgan's previously\npublished account of the former, he had stated that Madame\nCoulomb had charge of the keys of the Shrine, and the strength\nof Mr. P. Sreenevas Rao's case for the genuineness of his phenomenon\nrested upon his statement that he had a9ked Madame Coulomb to\nbe allowed to see the Shrine, had managed to do so on the following\nevening, and that Madame Coulomb could not in 'the interval have\nwritten to Madame Blavatsky, and received a Mahatma letter in time\nfor his visit, which had occurred while Madame Blavatsky was at\nOotacamund; and it was impossible to give any consistent account of\nthese incidents without its clearly appearing that Madame Coulomb had\n(lharge of the keys during Madame Bla.vatsky's absence, as was no\ndoubt actually the case. It is difficult to suppose that the first of lIr.\nDamodar's conflicting written statements was not a wilful and deliberate\nfalsehood.\n(7) Mr. Damodarstates that the sideboarddid not come into existence\ntill January, 1884, when the phenomena were no longer produced in the\nShrine. Dr. Hartmann in his pamphlet of September, 1884, wrote\nthat on the suggestion of M. Coulomb \"a heavy cupboard WIIS con-\nstructed according to his [M. Coulomb's] plan, and under his super-\nvision, in the month of December, 1883, and the said cupboard was\nplaced against the said wall on the said side opposite to that on which\nhung the 'Shrine';\" and in reply to my inquiry he stated that this cup-\nboard [the sideboard] in which M. Coulomb showed the movable back,\nwas \"t,\"8.inst the east side of the wall behind the Shrine during the\nanniversary [December 27th]. Its presence at that time is also\n(lertified to by Mrs. Morgan, Mr. Subba Row, Judge P. Sreenevas Rao,\nand various other witnesses. (See Appendix IV.) Mr. Damodar\ntherefore is in disagreement with very important Theosophical witnesses,\nand his own statement looks as if it was made because he realised\nthe cardinal necessity of establishing the falsehood tha.t the sideboard\nwas not in its position during the anniversary celebration of December,\n1883 (when Shrine-phenomena occurred), if the allegations made by the\nCoulombs were to be disproved. I had reason to think that he\nforced the evidence of several minor witnesses on this point. I\nfound that in more than one instance he had instructed the witness\nDigitized by Google\n\f0\" Pll8nomena connected with Tke080p\"\/I. 231\nbeforeha.nd as to what replies should be given to my questions. I\nnaturally endeavoured to preclude this preliminary arrangement, and on\none occasion, having unexpectedly paid a visit to Mr. RathJlD.velu, a.\nwitness whose written statement had come into my possession, I was\ngreeted by the significant remark, \"Damodar didn't tell me you were\ncoming.\" This gentleman admitted, though with manifest reluctance,\nthat the sideboard was in its position at the time of tho anniversary in\n1883. The witnesses who state the contl-ary are all of them, I think,\npersons whom there are independent reasons for regarding as un-\nreliable. .\nThese contradictions and false assertions as regards the Shrine,\nconstitute by themselves, I think, a sufficient ground for regarding Mr.\nDamodar as for our purposes an untrustworthy witness.\nr-MR. DAllODAR'S \"AsTRAL\" JOURNEYS.\nI shall now proceed to show that there is nothing in the circum-\nstances connected with Mr. Damodar's \"astral\" journeys which renders\nit difficult to suppose a pre-arrangement between him and Madame\nBlavatsky to make it appear that he took them; and even that some\nof the circumstances suggest a suspicion of such an arrangement. Colonel\nOlcott is of opinion that such a pre-arrangement was not possible, but\nI do not think that any ODe who reads his evidence will agree with him,\nespecially if they take his statements in connec~ion with some addi-\ntional information which I have since acquired. The following is the\nevidence given by Colonel Olcott before the Committee as to one of\nthese Ie astral\" journeys :-\nAt Moradabad, N.W.P., India, being on an official tour from Bombay to\nCashmere and back, I was very strongly importuned by a gentleman named\nShankar Singh, a Government official, and not then 1\\ Theosophist, to under-\ntake the cure of two lads, aged 12and 14 years respectively, who had each on\narriving at the age of 10 years become paralysed. It is known, I believe.\nto many here that I have the poller of healing the sick by the voluntary\ntransferonce of vitality. I refused in this instance, having already within\nthe previous year done too much of it for my health. The gentleman\nurged me again. I again refused. He spent, perhaps, 10 or 15 minutes\nin trying to persuade me and endeavouring to shake my resolution; but, as\nI still refused, he went to Mr. Damodar, who was travelling Witll me in his\nofficial capacity. Shankar Singh represented the case, and appealed to Mr.\nDamodar's sympathies, and at last persuaded him to go in the double, or\nphantasm, to the headquarters of our Socie~ at Madras, and try to enlist\nthe goodwill of Madame Blavataky.\nMR.

All the elements are against any\nprocurement. To understand the present case, you must know that it is the\nrule in those Eastern schools of myatical research that the pupils are not\npermitted to seek intercourse with Teachers other than their own. Hence,\nlfr. Damodar, who is the pupil-the Sanskrit word ia chela-of the Mahatma\nKoot Hoomi, could not himself approach my own Teacher, who is another\nperson. (Colonel Olcott here exhibited the portrait of his own Teacher, but\npreferred to withhold the name from publicity, though he mentioned it to\nthe Committee.) Madame Blavatskyand I are pupils of the same Master,\nand hence she Wall at liberty to communicate with him on this subject. Mr.\nDamodar, preparatory to taking hiB aerial flight, then sent Mr. Shankar\nSingh out of the room and closed the door. A few minutes later he returned\nto his visitor, who was waiting just outside in the verandah. They came in\ntogether to the part of the house where I was sitting with a number of Hindu\ngentlemen and one European, and told me what hRd happened in consequence\nof my refusa.l to heal the boys. Mr. Damodar R&.id that he had been in the\ndouble to headquarters (Madras), and had talked with Madame Blavatsky,\nwho had refused to interfere. But while they were conversing together,\nboth heard a voice, which they recognised as that of my Teacher.\nMR. SUCK: Not of Mahatma Koot Hoomi 1\nCoLONEL OLCOTT: No, that of my own Teacher. Mahatma. Koot Hoomi\nll&d nothing to do with me in this affair. While they were talking they heard\nthis voice, which gave a message, and Mr. Damodar remarked that, if I\nwould take pencil and paper, he would dictate from memory the message. I\ndid so.\nMR. MYERS: You have the p8.1>er 1\nCOLO~'\"BL OLOOT1': Yes. Shankar Singh then, in the preaence of all,\n88.t down and wrote a brief statement of the circumstances, and it was en-\ndorsed by 12 persons, including myself.\u00b7\n*\nThe memQrandum states that Mr. Damodar added, after repeating the\nmessage which he had received from headquarters, that he had aIIked Madame\nBlavatsky to confirm the thing to me by sending a telegram repeating the\nmessage or iti subatance, either to himself or to Shankar Singh. The next\nmoming the expected telegram arrived.\n* * *\nMR. MYERS: You do not know whether Damodar Wall seen by Madame\nBlavatsky 1\nCOLONEL OLCOTT: She told me that she had seen hinl. At the head-\nquarters resides M. Alexis Coulomb, Librarian of the Society. He was at;\nthe time of Damodar's alleged visit engaged at some work in the room\nadjoining the writing bureau, where Madame Blavatsky was. Suddenly he\ncame into the room and asked Madame Blavatsky where Mr. Damodar was\nas he had heard his voice in conversation with her.\nMR. MyERS: From whom did you hear this 1\nDigitized by Google\n\f0\" Phenomena connected Wit\/I Theosophy. 233\nCOLONEL OLCOTT: From M. Coulomb himaeH. He said, .. I have just\nheard his voice distinctly... Madame Blavataky said, \"He haa not returned...\nM. Coulomb seemed surpriaeil : he thought Mr. Damodar had unexpectedly\nreturned, and could hardly be persuaded that he had not been in the room\ntalkiug to Madame Blavatakv.\nThe following is the message :-\nReceived by D.

Cajapati\noil to rub in three times daily to relieve sufferers. Karma cannot be\ninterfered with.\"\nThe evidence of various witnesses shown to us by Colonel Olcott\nestablishes the delivery of the message by Mr. Damodar, and .the\nreceipt of the genuine corresponding telegram from Madame\nBlavatsky.\nIn order to show the little probability there was of any conspiracy\nbetween Mr. Shankar Singh and Mr. Damodar, Colonel Olcott\nstated :-\nNotice had been put into The TMosophist BOrne months before that I was\ngoing to make such and such official tours throughout India, and that persons\nwho had sick friends to be treated might, within certain hours on the second\nday of my viait to each station, bring them to me to be healed. Shankar\nSingh had written to me long before my coming to Moradabad, asking me to\nundertake the curo of these boys, and offering to bring them to Madras to\nme. I refused to see anybody there, but told him that he could bring the\nboys to me when I came to Moradabad, in the course of my tour; and it was\nin pursuance of that authorisation that he came and importuned me so.\nHe saiel, .. Here ia BOmething that you are, in a way, pledged to undertake,\"\nand that ia what made him 80 urgent.\nNow in dealing with the real sequence of events, this last statement\nshould be considered first. It appears that before Colonel Olcott\nstarted on his tour it was known at headquarters that when he reached\nMoradabad, Mr. Shankar Singh would expect him to fulfil his promise\nand mesmerise the boys. But wha.t were the peculiar circumstances\nwhich would compel Colonel Olcott to resist the importuning of Mr.\nShankar Singh t Before starting on the tour, Colonel Olcott had\nendeayoured to heal certain sick persons at Poona \"by the voluntary\ntransference of vitality.\" I was informed by a Poona Theosophist that\nsome 200 patients were assembled, and that Colonel Olcott had\n\u2022 The use of the word .. parties It seems to me a lIu8piciou8 circumstance.\nWhy should thia general and rather odd word be u8ed if it were not to cover\npossible but unforeseen contingencies!

Notwithstanding this,\nhowever, Colonel Olcott might have been persuaded by Mr. Shallkal'\nHingh to the redeeming of his promise; it was, perhaps, for this reason\nthat a special injunction against his undertaking any cure was issued\nin the form of a Mahatma document, which reached him through lJr.\nDamodar.\n\"October 19th.-Through D. K. lI. got an order from the\nChohans not to heal any more until further orders.\"-(Colonel Olcott's\ndiary, 1883.)\nIn this way Colonel Olcott's refusal was ensured. It may be\nobserved that this important fact is not disclosed in Colonel Olcott's\ndeposition. Thc reason there given by him for his refusal was that he\nhad \"already within the pre\u00a5ious year done too much of it [healing]\nfor his health.\" That the order referred to in his diary was the cause\nof his refusal,whatever the alleged cause of the order itself, is confirmed\nby Mr. Brown's statement (Some E;qJerienCl.l8 in Ifldia, pp. 14, 15).\nColonel Olcott . . \u2022 had been ordered by his Gill\"!! to desist fl'OIll\ntreating patients until further notice, and, when application was made to him\nby Mr. Shankar Singh, of Morndabad, on behalf of two orphan children, he\nwas under the neceBBity ofrefueing the request. Damodar, however, became\nintere8ted in the matter, and said that he would ask for permission tv be\ngranted for this special case.\nBut the most crucial point of the incicltmt turne(l upon Madanle\nBlavatsky's ignorance or knowledge that the tra,'ellers were at\nlIoradabac1, and in reply to the definite question put by Mr. Myers,\nColonel Olcott declared that it was not known at headquarters that he\nwas at Moradabad. Now, some time after my arrival at Adyar, I took\nthe opportunity, when Colonel Olcott was examining his diary, of\nrequesting him to furnish me with the dates on which he visited the\nTarious towns included in his tour of 1883. He replied that I could\nget them from the programme of the tour antecedently published in TIl1\nTlleoBopltiBt, as the programme had been carried out. To my remark\nthat I had understood from his deposition that the previously settled\nprogramme was interrupted, he answered that it had been somewhat\nalteredinconsequence of his founding new l.ranches not anticipated, and\nhe then proceeded to quote the dates from his diary. I afterwards com-\npared .these with the previously published programme, which hears the\ndate of October 17th. Twelve towns were mentioned in the progrnmme,\nwhich extended over the dates from October 22nd to Nm'ember 18th,\nand the dat~s corresponded in e\u00a5ery case but one with those of Colonel\nDigitized by Google\n\fOJ, Phel\/omena cOianected ,citk Tlte080plt!l. 235\nOlcott's diary, the discrepancy in that case being probably apparent\nonly, and not real. (According to the diary Cawnpore was reached on\nNovember 2nd, and the time given in the programme was 12.24 a.m.\non November 3rd.)\nIt appeared from the programme, then, that Moradahad was to Le\nreached on No,-ember 9th, and left on Novemher 11th (and it appears\nfrom Colonel Olcott's diary that it was reached 011 November 9th, and\nleft on November 11th), so that it was known long previously at head-\nquarters that Colonel Olcott would be at Moradabad on November lOth,\nwhen the illcident occurred, if the programme were not interrupted.\nColollel Olcott's reason for asserting that it was not kllown at head-\nquarters that he was at Moradabad appears to be that, on the course\nof his tours generally, he was constantly obliged to interrupt the\npreviously-settled programme, and that therefore, apparently, no\ncertain reliance could be placed on the programme for this particular\ntour. This at least is the most favourable interpretation of the\nevidence which he gave before our Committee. I may note,\nhowever, that the following special proviso was attached to the\nlist antecedently published in Tlte Theosophist: \"This programme\nwill be as strictly adhered to as possible. Any change, necessitated by\nunforeseen contingencies, will he signified by telegram.\" (Thus in case\nof change of programme, Mr. Damodar would have had an adequate\nreason for visiting the telegraph office, and might have sent a warning\ntelegram to }Iadame Blavatsky without exciting any suspicion.) But\nthe programme, as we have seen above, was closely kept, and the:- \/\ncumstances throughout were admirably adapted for a pre-arrangement.\nYet Colonel Olcott, after il.sserting that it was not known at he -\nquarters that he was at Moradabad, and giving a general reasoll for\nsupposillg that it could not be kllown, adds: \"All the elements are\nagainSt any procurement.\" His promise to the waiting Shankar Singh,\nthc \" Chohans' \" emphatic prohibition hestowed upon him by Damodar,\nthe programme which pointed with a steady finger to Moradabacl on\nNovember lOth, the easy opportunity afforded to Mr. J;>amodar of\nguarding against afiasco in case of any unforeseen contingency-U all\nthe elements are against any procurement\" !\nI may notice here that M. Coulomb has stated to me that he told\nColonel Olcott a falsehood at the request of Madame Blavatsky; and\nI may recall the fact, which we felt bound to mention in our First\nReport (p. 40, note), that when Colonel Olcott quoted to us 1\\L\nCoulolllb's testimony as that of a trustworthy witness, he was aware\nthat M. Coulomb had been charged with making trap-doors and\nother apparatus fol' trick manifestations. Further, when Colonel Olcott\nreceived the proof-sheets of his deposition, he must have been aware\nth3t the Coulombs had been expelled from the Theosophical Society.\nR 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f236 MI'. Hodgson's Report\nColonel Olcott also refened to M. Coulomb as a witness in the only\nothel' instance of MI'. Damodar's alleged IIStral journeys which came\nwithin the scope of my investigations in India.*\nThis case Colonel Olcott described as follows :-\n\" TIle second case is one of a similar character On the night of the 17th\nof November, 1883-to wit, seven days later-I W&8 in the train on my way\nfrom Meerut, N.W.P., to Lahore. Two persons were in the carriage with\nme-Mr. Damodar, and another Hindu named Narain Swamy Naidu, who\nwere &8leep on their beds at either side of the sa.1oon compartment. I\nmyself W&8 reading a book by the light of the lamp. Damodar had been\nmoving upon his bed from time to time, showing that he W&8 not physically\nasleep, &8 the other one W&8. Presently Damodar came to me and &8ked\nwhat time it was. I told him that it W&8 a few minutes to 6 p.m. He said,\n\u2022 I have just been to headquarters'-meaning in the double-'and all\naccident has happened to Madame Blavatsky.' I inquired if it W&8 any-\nthing serious. He said that he could not tell me: but she had tripped her\nfoot in the carpet, he thought, and fa.11en heavily upon her right knee.\nI thereupon tore a piece of paper out of some book,\nand on the spot made a memorandum, which W&8 signed by myself and the\nsecond Hindu. \"\nThe memorandum runs as follows :-\n\"In train at Nagul Station, S.P. and D. Railway, at 5.55 p.m., 17\/11\/83.\nD. K. M. says he h&8 just been (inSukshma Sarirs) to headquarters. H.P.B.\nh&8 just tripped in carpet and hurt right knee. Had just taken K. H. 's\nportrait from Shrine. Heard her mention names of General and Mrs.\nMorgan. Thinks they are there. Saw nobody but H. P. B., butftlt several\nothers.\"\n\"The next station reached by the train was Saharanpur, where a ha.1t of\nhalf-an-hour for supper occurred. I went directly to the telegraph office,\nand sent a despatch to Madame Blavatsky &8 near &8 I can remember in the\nfollowing words: 'What accident happened at headquarters at about 6\no'clock. 1 Answtlr to Lahore.' \"\nTo this Madame Blavatsky telegraphed in reply :-\n.. Nearly broke right leg, tumbling from bishop's chair, dragging\nCoulomb, frightening Morgans. Damodar startled us.\"\nColonel Olcott added :-\n\"The presence of General and Mrs. Morgan at headquarters is confirmcll\nby this telegram, and before that we travellers had no knowledge of their\nllaving come down from the Nilgiris.\"\nAnd to this remark Madame Blavatsky made the following note\n* Some remarks on the a.11eged appearances of Mr. Damodar in London will\nbe found at p. 388.\nDigitized by Goo\n\f0\" P1tenomena cO\/meclea with Theo8opl,y. 237\nwhen she looked over Colonel Olcott's deposition before the Committee\nill proof:-\n\"They had just arrived from Nilgherry Hills.-H. P. BLAVATSKY.\"\nIt seemed, then, that in this case the testimony of General and\nMrs. Morgan might afford very important evidence disproving the possi-\nbility of pre-arrangement between Madame Blavatsky and Mr. Damodal'.\nFor it might have proved (1) that their presence at headquarters\ncould not be known to Mr. Damodar; and (2) that the accident to\n:Madame Blavatsky was a genuine one, and occurred at the hour named.\nI learnt, however, from General and Mrs. Morgan that they had been\nat headquarters a week; that they had been specially summoned thither\nby a Mahatma letter ; and el'en then were not direct witnesses of the\naccident. Thus every obstacle to a pre-arrangement vanishes. Indeed,\nthe summoning of the Morgans to headquarters, taken in connection\nwith the way their names are dragged into Madanle Blavatsky's tele-\ngram, and Madame Blavatsky's own note as to their having just arrived,\nbecomes a very suspicious circumstance.\nOn the whole, then, when I consider the probability from what we\notherwise know of Madame Blavatsky, that any marvel in which she\nplays a part is spurious rather than genuine; the untruthfulness of Mr.\nDamodar as displayed in his testimony about the Shrine; the absence\nof any evidence for these marvellous communications except that of\nMadame Blavatsky and Mr. Damooar; the circumstances favouring\npre-arrangement between the two; and the minor points that I have\nnoted which positively suggest such pre-arrangement; the conclusion\nthat these \" astral\" journeys were fabulous appears to me to be\nirresistible. And from this conclusion it further follows that no\nimportance can be attached to any other accounts of apparent marvels\nwhich can be explained by attributing them to the agency of Mr.\nDamodar. The full significance of this inference will be seen later on,\n,vhen I come to discuss the accounts of Mahatma letters received in\n:Mndame Blavatsky's absence.\nCOLOYEL OWOTT'S EVIDEYCE.\nI hal-e already dwelt more fully on Mr. Damodar's \"astral\"\njourneys.than was demanded merely to show how easy was pre-\narrangement between Madame Blavatsky and !Ir. Damodar. I have\ndone so partly in order to show how worthless Colonel Olcott's state-\nlllents and inferences are seen to lie when placed side by side with the\nrecord of events as they actually occurred. I will give another instance\nof the same unreliability.\nIn replying to a question put by Mr. Myers in connection with\nDigitized by Google\n\f238 MI'. Hodg8on'8 Report\nColonel Olcott's account of the alleged \"astral\" form of a Mahatma\nwhieh appeared to him in. New York, Colonel Olcott stated ;-\n\" I never saw a living Hindu before I arrived in London on nly way to\n\u2022India. I had had no correspondence with anybody until then, and had no\nknowledge of any Ih'ing Hindu who could have visited me in America.\"\nNow Colonel Olcott arrived in London on his way to India ill\n18i9. The Theosophical Society was founded in 18i5, and long before\nthis Colonel Olcott had travelled with Hindus from New York to\nLiverpooJ. He had made their acquaintance and obtained their portraits,\nwhich, as he tells one of them in a letter which I have seen, were\nbanging on his walls in 18H. During the years 18H and 18i8 he\nwrote many letters to one of them, Mr. M. T., who became a member\nof the Theosophical Society, and was intimate with Colonel Olcott ill\nBombay, but died several years ago.\nIt seems, then, that Colonel Olcott had been in familiar relations\nwith a Hindu, whom he first met on the passage from America to Eng-\nland, long before he reached London 011 his way to India, and even long\nbefore the \" astral figure\" in questioll appeared to him in New York.\nlloreover, it was M. T. who first began the Theosophical Society in\nBombay, antecedent to the removal of headquarters from America to\nIndia. 'Vhat, then, is the explanation of Colonel Olcott's\nstatement to the Committee in his deposition 1 After it had\nbeen pointed out to Colonel Olcott that this statement was\nquite irreconcilable with fact, as could be easily proved from letters\nof his which I had examined, he admitted that he had met M. T.\nlong previously, and he showed a remarkably clear recollection of tho\ncircumstances-at least of the circumstances which were referred to in\nhis letters to M. T. He accounted for his statement to the\nCommittee by urging that his attention at the time was\nbeing specially directed to the possibility of personation of\nthe Mahatma's \" astral form,\" and that he momentarily forgot\nhis experiences* with 1\\1. T. and other Hindus. I do not, of\ncourse, deny this to be the case, though part of Colonel Olcott's state-\nment in his deposition was quite uncalled for, and appeal'S to me to\nrender his lapse of memory somewhat singular. He seems to haw'\nvolunteered the odd remark that he \"had had no correspondence with\nanybody until then,\" whereas he had written numerous letters to\n1\\[. T. and other Hindus, and had started the Theosophical Societ.y\nof India by means of such correspondence. And it must be l'emem-\n* It may also be urged in Colonel Olcott's fa\\'our that his later experiences\nwith 1\\1. T. in Bombay would tend to obscure their earlier relationFl; but\nagainst this again we must place the fact that Colonel Olcott appears from\nhis letters to have regarded these earlier relations as \"ery specially memoraLle.\nDigitized by Google\n\f011 Phenomena connected. fCitl~ TheosopllY. 239\nbered that Colonel Olcott had the opportunity of cbrrecting his state-\nlUent in proof, when he could not have been affected by that momentary\nforgetfulness which overcame him in the presence of the pointed\nquestion propounded by Mr. Myers.\nOther instances of the unreliability of Colonel Olcott's statements,\ndue eit~er to peculiar lapses of memory or to extreme deficiency in the\nfaculty of observation, will be found on pp. 253, 309, and 365.\nI cannot, therefore, regard Colonel Olcott's testimony as of any\nscientific value. In particular, his testimony to the alleged \"astral\"\nappearance in New York proves,'in my opinion, no more than that he\nsaw some one in his room, who may have been an ordinary Hindu, or\nsome other person, disguised as a Mahatma for the purpose, and acting\nfor Madame Blavatsky. And the same may be said of all his testi\u00b7\nmony to apparitions of Mahatmas.\nEVIDENCE OF MR. MOOINI M. COATl'ERJEE.\nThe testimony of another gentleman, !\\lr. Mohini M. Chatterjee,\nwho gave evidence as to the apparitions of Mahatmas, is open to\n0. similar charge of Jamentable want of accuracy; but in his case\nit must be said that he always professed that he had never\npaid any great attention to phenomena. Moreover, his testimony\nnever appeared to us to be of special importance ill the way\nof establishing the genuineness of the supposed marvellous events\nrelated by him, because we never thought it impossible that he might\nIlaye been deceh-ecl. We thought, however, that a further acquaint-\nance with the localities where the apparitions occurred, and the exami\u00b7\nnation of other witnesses, might strengthen his evidence; but the\nreyerse has proved to be the case. (See Appendix VII.) After con\u00b7\nsidering the statements of the other witnesses, and examining the\nplaces where the alleged events occurred, the probability that the\nwitnesses were imposed upon becomes much more manifest than\nappears from a reading of Mr. Mohini's evidence alone. Indeed, Mr.\n!\\Iohini's description of the spots where the alleged\" astral\" apparitions\nappeared is more than merely imperfect; it is almost ludicrous.\nFor instlmce, in describing the second alleged \"astral\" apparition,\nMr. Mohini stated :-\n\"We were sitting on the ground-on the rock, outBide the house in\nBombay, when a figure appeared a short distance away.\"\nAll the other witnesses appear to be agreed that the party were sitting\nin the verandah, and not upon what some of them described as the ,\u00b7ock;\nthey gave this name to the irregular summit of the hill upon the side\nof which the house (Crow's Nest Bungalow) was situated. There are\nfiY6 terrace-fields or gardens on the side of the hill, and the verandah\nDigitized by Google\n\f\u2022\n240 M,'. Hodg8on'8 Report\nwhere the part.y wpre sitting was on the same level as the topmost of\nthese. Above and beyond rose the summit of the hill like a high\nbank, to which there was easy access from the farther side, not visible\nfrom the terrace-gal'den or the verandah; and it was upon this summit\nthat the \" figure\" appeared. Having pointed this out to Mr. Mohini\nin a personal interview, I learn that he attributes the inaccuracy of his\naccount to his defectin knowledge of the English language, and that\nby \"rock,\" he meant the ground of the top terrace just outside the\nbungalow; the use of the word \"rock\" in this sense is certainly\ninappropriate; the spot is elsewhere * described as the \"garden of the\nupper terrace.\" Mr. Mohini also pleads his defective knowledge of the\nEnglish language in explanation of certain other inconsistencies-to\nwhich I drew his attention-betwel'n his statements and those of the\nother witnesses.\nAgain, in the case of the first alleged \"astral n apparitio.l, we had\nbeen led by Mr. Mohini's deposition to suppose that not only himself\nbut the other witnesses bad recognised the figure. Being asked\nwhether all agreed that it could not be a real man walking in the way\ndescribed, Mr. Mohini replied :-\n\" Certainly. It seemed to us to bo the apparition of the original of the\nportrait in Colonel Olcott's room, and which is R880Ciated with ono of the\nMahatmas.\"\nIn reply to Mr. Stack's question, whether he could distinguish the\nfeatures, Mr. Mohini replied: \"Oh, yes, and the dress, the turban, and\neverything,\" but afterwards, in reply to Mr. Gurney's question whether,\nif he had seen the face, alone, he would have recognised it, he replil'd\nthat he did not know, that it was the whole thing taken together\nwhich produced on him the impression that it was the apparition of the\noriginal of the portrait in Colonel Olcott's room.\nNow, not one of the other witnesses whom I examined recognised\nthe features; they could not even tell whether the figure had a beard or\nnot, with the exception of Mr. Ghosal, who \"saw something like a\nbeard, but not very distinctly.\"\nNor are the witnesses by any means agreed about other points\nto which Mr. Mohini refers. For instance, Mr. Mohini said the figure\n\"seemed to melt away.\" Mr. Ghosal said, \"It appeared to me, and a\nfew of those present were of the same opinion, that the figure walked\nover one of the trees and suddenly disappeared.\" Mr. Mohini now\nexplains that when he said the figure seemed to melt away, he meant\nmerely that the figure disappeared. [In his deposition before the Com-\nmittee Mr. Mohini said that the figure disappeared, and when Mr.\n\u2022 \"Hints on ElIOteric Theof'Ophy,\" p. 00.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOil PhenomelUl cOlllJeCtea l~itll Tl,e080pll!l. 241\nMyers asked, \"In what way clid it disappear t\" Mr. Mohini\nreplied, \"It seemed to melt away.\"J Another witness described the\nfigure as walking to and fro below the balcony on the third terrace field)\nand appeared to think it could not have been an ordinary person,\nbecause it would have been difficult for a man to walk freely in that\nplace, which he alleged to be full of thorny trees. But I found when I\ninspected the old headquarters in Bombay that this description also was\ninaccurate, and that it was perfectly easy for anyone, even though\ndisguised in flowing. robes, to walk freely over any of the terraces.\nAnd I took care to ascertain that the terraces had not been altered in\nthe interval.\nIn short, after my examination of the locality, I was left without\nany doubt that th~ appearances might have been well produced by\nM. Coulomb in disguise. I have seenM. Coulomb disguised asa Mahatma,\nand can understand that the figure may have been very impressive.\nA dummy head (with shoulders), like that of a Hindu, with beard, kc.\nand feha., is worn on the top of the head of the person disguised. A\nlong flowing muslin garment falls down in front, and by holding the\nfolds very slightly apart, the wearer is enabled to see, and to speak also,\nif necessary. I do not think it in the least degree likely that any of the\nwitnesses in the above cases would have penetrated this disguise had\nthe figure been even lUuch nearer than it was, and the light much better.\nI was unable to estimate the precise distance of the figure in the\nsecond case, but in the first case the figure must, from an examination\nof the locality, have been certainly more than 40 yards from the spec-\ntators. We can hardly attach any importance to the supposed recog-\nnition, ,and from a portrait only, of a figure at this distance, even in\nbright moonlight. Moreover, a good view of the figure must have been\nalmost impossible in consequence of the trees and shrubs in the\nneighbourhood.\nThe third case mentioned by Mr. Mohini, that of an alleged \"astral \"\napparition at Adyar, possesses, if possible, still less evidential value\nthan the foregoing, especially after Mr. Mohini's later accounts to\nmyself. It appears from Mr. Mohini's deposition that the figure\ndisappeared on one side of the ba.lcony * [terrace], at the edge of the\nbalcony, above a flight of steps.\nr -\nMR.

There was a tree on the other side,\nand it was in order to prevent all suspicion that it might be something that\nhad got down the tni~ or anything of that kind, that we requested him to\ndisappear from the side where there was no exit. The figure went over to\nthat spot and then disappeared.\nMR. MYERS: You 81\\11' its disappearance 1\nMR.

There were several persons looking at\nthe moment, and my own idea is that it would have been perfectly impossible\nfor a person to have jumped down.\nMR. STACK: Why 1\nMR. MOBISI: There is a small flight of stl\/pS just below the balcony,\nand if a man had jumped from the balcony he must have fallen upon the\nsteps and broken his legs, When the figure passed and re-passed us we\nbeard nothing of any footsteps. Besides myself, Damodar and ~Iadame\nBlavatBky were in the room at the time.\nMr_ Damodar, whom I questioned, declared that the figure dis-\nappeared at a spot which he pointed out to me; this spot was not near\nthe edge of the balcony, and was just opposite and close to the dOOl'\nof the Occult Room which opens on the ba.lcony. (See Plan.) I\nthought, at the time, that the disagreement between this account\nand Mr. l\\Iohini's might be due to a desire on Mr. Damodar's part to\nconvince me that Madame Coulomb was not acquainted with the cir-\ncumstances of the case.\nMr_ lIohini, in the later account which he W've to me in our first\ninterview &ftet\u00b7 my return from India, described the figure as dis-\nappearing at a spot which to a great extent approxima.tes to that\npointed outby Mr. Damodar, but is nevertheless not quite in agreement;\nand I feel bound to say, after careful consideration, that had it been in\ncomplete agreement, Mr. Mohini's later account would have involved a.\nclear and absolute stultification of his earlier one; and even as it is,\n1\\11'. l\\Iohini's two accounts are fundamentally at variance. Instead of\nthe figure's disappealing, as was stated in his original deposition, on 0111J\nBide oj the balcony and abot'e ajligltt oj steps, the figure is now made to\ndisappear at a spot which should be described rather as the Irollt of\nthe bakony, and where there were no steps below. I cannot at.tribute\nDigitized by Google\n\fO\/~ Phenomena connected fcith Theosoph\/l. 243\nany evidential value to these conflicting statements: nor does the\ncase seem to me improved by the explanation given to me by\nMr. Mohini in our last interview, that he had not examined the\nplace to see whether there were any steps below, and that it was\nonly when the question was put by Mr. Stack as to why it was\nimpossible for the figure to have jumped down [Mr. Mohini having\nmade the statement, and Mr. Stack having asked wIlY?] that he\nthought he remembered there were steps under the balcony in that\nspot (i.e., the spot described..in his later account). In Mr. Mohini's\nearlier account the point of disappearance of the figure was determined\nby the side of the balcony, the position of the tree on the other\nside, the edge of the balcony, and the flight of steps. Mr. Mohini's\nlater account contradicts his earlier one in three out of theae four\ndctermining conditions.\nI may now say that the pa.l!SRgc quoted above from Mr. Mohini's\ndE'position to the Committee, which was made before anything was known\nbere publicly of the charges brought by the Coulombs, agrees entirely,\nso far as it goes, both as to the movements of tbe figure and as to the\nplace ot its disappearance, with the account furnished to me indepen-\ndently (that is, without any opportunity, as I believe, of knowing what\n.Mr. Mohini had said) by Madame Coulomb, who alleges that she acted\nas the Mahatma on this occasion. The spot where she described herself\nas finally escaping from view was at the edge of the balcony on one\nside of the balcony; a flight of steps was just below, and a tree was\nnear the other side of the balcony. Her account was that, after dis-\nguising herself as a :M:ahatma in the bath-room-now Mr. Damod!l.r\u00b7s\nroom (see Plan)-she passed through the cupboard with the secret\ndouble back into the Occult Room, and thence through the door leading\nout upon the terrace, where she passed along close to the wall in a\nst!>oping attitude until she came opposite the middle window of the\nsitting-room, when she slowly rose to full height (the dummy head an<l\nshoulders being added to her own stature). The spectators in the\nroom, she declared, Sl.luted with profound respect. She was provided,\nshe said, -.vith flowers, which were concealed in the folds of her muslin\nrobE', and which she threw over Mr. Mobini; and after walking up\nand down on the terrace several times, she finally passed away at the\neast side of the balcony, departing into the new room, which was\nthen in process of construction, and thence by the north side\nof the terrace back into the bath-room. She alleged also that she had\ntaken off' her shoes in order to move silently, and that it wPS.\nso da.rk that she hurt her feet against some nails on the terrace;\nshe said that she had reeeh\u00b7ed the flowers that she had thrown oYer Mr.\nl\\Iohmi from 1\\ certain Madame de Wailly, dressmaker, who had\nsince left lIadras and is now living in Colombo, in Ceylo~ I\nDigitized by Google\n\f244 Mr. Hodgso,,'s Report\ncalled upon Madame de Wailly in Colombo, and found tha.t she\nrecollected having received severa.l bunches of flowers near the\nbeginning of 1884, and having given some to lIadame Coulomb.\nThere was one slight difference, however, between the statement\nof Madame Coulomb and that of Madame de Wailly. The former\nwas under the impression that the flowers given to her by Madame\nde Wailly had come from Banga.Iore, a hill station, whereas\n:Madame de Wailly was inclined to think that she had received them\nfrom oil. friend living on the outskirts of Madras, who had presented\nher with a bouquet of magnificent roses. She believed that it was\nthese roses which she had given to Madame Coulomb.\nMadame Coulomb stated that the night was dark, and ill reply\nto my specilll inquiry, said that there was no moonlight. Mr. Mohini,\nhowever, had said in reply to a question put by Mr. Myers, that there\nwas moonlight on the balcony. On reference to the calendar it ap-\npeara that there was no moonlight. Mr. Mohini now conjectures\nthat he may have mi'lta.ken the \"fading lamp-light\" or. the limit of the\nbalcony for moonlight.\nT do not myself feel quite certain about the existence of much\nlamp-light on the balcony j but it may be desirable to add here that, in\nany case, large portions of the -terrace must have remained in darkness,\nand that although the reader of Mr. Mohini's evidence given to the\nCommittee might almost suppose that the only exit from the terrace\nwas by means of a \"tree, or anything of that kind,\" there are various\nways in which an ordinary person disguised might have made his\nescape. The spectators were in the sitting-room looking from the\nmiddle window, and a reference to the Plan will show that cert\/Un\nportions of the terrace on both sides, east and west, were entirely hidden\nfrom their observationo The terrace might have been easily left not\nonly by the help of trees, but by proceeding in the direction of the\nuow room, or by mounting the roof,-not to speak of the door of the\nOccult Room, and the double-backed cupboard; or, considering that it\nwas 11 p.m., and that there was no moonlight, by a ladder from the\nterrace to the ground. Indeed, I have myself often, as 1\\ lad, pel'-\nformed a greater \"drop\" feat than would b3 required for leaving the\nterrace without the help even of a ladder.\nI ought to mention that Mr. Mohini had not the opportunity of\n:seeing the proof-sheets of his deposition and correcting any errors that\nmight have been made in our First Report. On June Ist, 1885, he wrote\nto Mr. Myers remarking on this fact, and stating that he had been\nlooking over the record of hia testimony given before the Committee,\nand he makes a correction in one particular. I need hardly say that\nI have not used the statement which Mr. Mohini thus corrects in my\ncriticism of Mr. Mohini's evidence. Mr. Mohini, howe\\'er, omitted to\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn PIlenomelia connected 10itl, Theo8oph!l. 245\ncorrect another error, the discovery of which contributes to destroy\nthe interest of another marvel described by him (see Appendix VII.);\nnamely, the case of an alleged phenomenal letter which appeared on\nthe table of Mr. Keightley, a member of the Theosophical Society, ill\nParis, .and which referred to the \"\/riend8\" of Mr. Mohini. The\nquestion was asked by Mr. Myers :-\n\" Could the letter have been written sODie days before, and the al1usion\nas to taking your friends into the country inserted afterwards 1\"\nMr. Mohini is represented in the deposition as replying:-\n\"No, bel.'Souse Mr. Keightley and Mr. Oakley only came to the house by\naccident that morning.\"\nMr. Oakley has told me that he went frequently to the Palis\napartments and might be expected to call. Mr. Keigbtley has told me\nthat he was unaware that Mr. Oakley was even in Paris, and that Mr.\nOakley had called unexpectedly. But both Mr. Keightley and .MI\u00b7.\nOakley are agreed that Mr. Keightley himself was living in the rooms\nat the time with Mr. llohini. After this discrepancy had been pointed\nout, Mr. Mohini declared that the reply he is represented as giving\nhe did not give, and that the shorthand reporter, who took down\nthe evidence given before the Committee, must have made a.\nmistake. But the reader may himRelf compare Mr. Mohini's evidence\nwith that of the other witnesses (see Appendix VII.), and he will see\nhow much more marvellous the incidents in question have become\nunder the constructive and destructive action of Mr. Mohini's memory.\nFor example, in the case just referred to, of the letter found on Mr.\nKeightley's table, it would appear from Mr. Mohini's account thl\\t he\nhad gone with Mr. Keightley into Mr. Oakley's room, that Mr. Oakley\nand Babula were together, and that both Mr. Mohini and Babula were\nin Mr. Keightley's sight while the latter was absent from his room.\nUnder these circumatances it was not easy to see who could have placed\nthe letter orr the table in the interval; but when we find that, according\nto Mr. Oakley and Mr. Keigbtley, Mr. Mohini did not enter Mr.\nOakley's room at all, that Babula was not with Mr. Oakley, that\nthere was probably a short internl of time during which both Mr.\nMohini and Babula were out of the sight of Mr. Keightley, and also of\nMr. Oakley, the incident ceoses to present any difficulty in the way of\nan ordinary explanation.\nREMAINING EVIDENCE FOR ApPEARANCES OF MAHATMAS.\nI lleed not here say much 011 the other alleged appearances of\nMahatmas, in either their ordinary physical or their\" astral\" bodies. A\nconfederate ill disguise is generally an easy and sufficient explanation of\nthem. I have, I think, ShOWll, ill Appendix VIII., that there is no real\nDigitized by Google\n\f2-16 JIi.. HodgsOll'1l Report\ndifficulty in applying this explanation even to the case of )ll'. Rama-\nswamier, whose account of his experience has made somuch impression on\n1\\11'. Sinnett. I have dealt similal'ly with other appearances in Appen-\ndices IX. and X. The statements in 1[1'. Brown's pamphlet, Some\nExperiences in Inclia, concerning which he was unwilling to give me\nany further details, need not detain us long. The 0111y time he saw\n\" Mah!l.tma Koot Hoomi\" in broad daylight, the figure was at a\ndistance. Mr. Brown says: \"On the morning of t.he 20th he caDle\nto my tent, and said, ' Now you see me before you in the flesh ; look\nand assure yourself that it is I,' and left a letter of instructions and\nsilk handkerchief, both of which are now in my possession,\" This inci-\ndent happened, it appears, at about 2 a.m., and Mr. Brown's particular\nreason for thinking the figure was \" Koot Hoomi\" seemed to be only\nthat the letter given to him was in the same handwriting as that of\nletters\" phenomenally\" received at headquarters from \"Koot Hoomi\"-.\nThe chief persons who testify from personal experience to the actual\nexistence of the Brotherhood in Thibet are (besides Madame Blavatsky)\n)[1'. Damodar and Mr. Babajee Dharbagiri Natb. Of the value of Mr.\nDamodar's evidence I have already said enough. 'Vith regard to )[1'.\nBabajee D. Nath, it is shown in Appendix I. that he has inyolved him-\nself in the attempted attack by Madame Blavatsky on the \"Sassoon\nTelegram\" letter, and a reference to Appendix IV. ,viII show that he\nlias made statements which I cannot but rp.gard as wilfully false con-\ncerning matters connected with the Shrine. Again, he stated to me\nthat he had lived with the Brothers only during certain months out of\na specific period of two years which immediately followed his leaving,\nin 1878, the position of private secretary to a deputy-collector in\nthe Kurnool district, although he had previously stated to Mr. Sinnett\n(\" The Occult World.\" pp. 154, 155, Fourth Edition) that he had been\nliving with Koot Hoomifor ten years. Further, it was, he said, only a few\nmonths after the lapse of these two years that he joined the Theosophical\nSocicty in Bombay, and thenceforward he has been cont.inuously at the\nheadquarters of the Society, except when he paid two visits to the\nNortb, one to Thibet, a.nd the other to the borders of Thibet. Now, from\nthis account it is clear that Mr. Bab~iee must have joined t.he Theo-\ns\u00b7.lphical Society in Bombay at least as early as 1881, and remained\nsome time at the headquarters in that year. But he does not seem to\nhave made his first appearance as Babajee Dharbagiri Nath until\ntowards the end of 18R2, at about which timo he yisited :\\[1'. Sinnett.\nWhen, later, he joined the headquarters of the Society, he was recog-\nlIised by Theosophists as Gwala K. Deb, who had bef'1l there before.\nThe assertion made by Madame Coulomb in her pamphlet., * anel\n\u2022 \"SoDle Account of my Intercourse with lIadallle Bla\\\"atsky,\" I'P. 48-50.\nDigitized by Google\n\f01, Pllenomena connected lcitk TlIeo8opl,y. 247\nrepeated more explicitly to myself, tha.t Mr. Babajee D. Nath is the\nsame person who was previously known in the headquarters at Bombay\nas Gwala K. Deb, is confirmed by the testimony of Mr. A. O. Hume,\nj)Ir. Tookaram Tatyo., Mr. Hal Nilaji Pitale, and Mr. Ezekiel; a.nd it\nseems to ba the only explanation of the above statements made to me\nby Mr. Babajee himself. Mr. Babll:jee indeed affirms that he never\npassed under the name of Gwlila K. Deb, but it is by 110 meaDs\nlikely that all these witnesses should mistake another person for\nMr. Babajee, for he is very small, and his voice has a very peculiar\ntimbre. Moreover, he seerus to have no objection to assuming different\ncharacters, since at this very time he represents two persons in the last\nOfficial Annual Report issued by the Theosophical Society; that is to\nsay, he appears under two different names. On p. 8 he appears as the\ndelegate of the Vizianagram Branch under the name of Babajee D.\nNat\" (otherwise written on pp. 83, 117, 120, as Mr. Dltarbagiri Natll,\nin connection with the Anniversary Hall Committee), and on p. 131-\nAppendix A. of the Theosophical Society's Report-he appears as one\nof the Assistant Recording Secretaries under the name of S. KriBlma-\nswami. Yet Babajee Dharbagiri Nath is the same person as S. Krishna-\nswami, the latter being Mr. Babajee's real name, according to his own\naccount to myself. I think that all will agree that the mere assertion ofa\npersonwho has made false andcontradictory statements,and has appeared\nunder different aliaseB, is insufficient to prove him\" the Chela of Koot\nHoomi that he declares himself to be,\" though it is difficult to avoid\nthe conclusion that\" if he is anything else,\" to use Mr. Sinnett's words,\n\"he, of course, must be a false witness, invented to prop up Madame\nBlavatsky's vast imposture.\" Additional evidence of this will be found\nin Part II. I may add that Mr. Babajee, if I may judge from the account\n(perhaps not very reliable) which he has given me of his changeful life,\nappears to be almost isolated and entirely homeless apart from the\nTheosophical Society, and is, I think, eagerly ready, out of gratitude\nfor sheltering kindness received from Madame Blavatsky, to dispense on\nher behalf most freely with the truth.\nRamo. Sourindro Gargya Devo., from whose alleged l~tter to Madame\nBlavatsky, asserting his intimacy with the Masters (published ill TI,e\nTlu1oBopltiBt for December, 1883), an extract was quoted in our First\nReport, cannot be regarded as an independent witness; seeing that his\n~wn existence is even more problematical than that of the Mahatmas,\nthe only evidence for it being the statement of Madame Blavatsky,\nMr. Babajee, and Mr. Damodar, that they know him. And Mr. Mirza\nMoorad Alee Beg, whose assertions (published in TIle TIMoBoplliBt for\nAugust, 1881) committed him, as we thought, nearly as fully as\nMadame Blavatsky and Mr. Damodar are committed, to the existence\nand powers of the Mahatmas, turns out, according to the statemt'nta\nDigitized by Google\n\f248 Mr. Hodg8on'8 RejJort\nof various Theosophists, to be altogether untrustworthy and to have\nshown evident marks of insanity. He is said to have practised Black\nMagic [!] before his connection with the Theosophical Society, which\nhe left long ago, and became a Roman Catholic; he is now a Mussul-\nman. I muat conclude, then, that the strongest apparent evidence for\nthe existence of the Mahatmas comes to nothing at all.\nALLEGED PRECIPITATED WRITING, \u00abC.\nI now pass to the consideration of alleged phenomenal occur-\nrences other than apparitions, especially those connected with pheno-\nmenalletters and the alleged precipitated writing.\nI will first draw attention to the statement made by both Mr.\nDamodar and Mr. P. Sreenevas Roo, that Shrine phenomena occurred\neven after Madame Blavatsky left Madras, and therefore after the\nhole in the party wall had been blocked up, according to 1\\1. Coulomb'a\nown statements.\nIn reply to my inquiries it was admitted by Mr. Damodar and Mr.\nP. Sreenevas Rao, that the only instances of these later Shrine pheno-\nmena are the two given in Appendix XI. It will be noticed by the\nreader, on reference to the Appendix, that in the second case, where a\nletter apparently requiring a specific reply is placed in the Shrine, a\nconsiderable interval elapses, and is probably necessary, before the\nanswer appears. In the first case no letter is pla.ced in the Shrine, no\nspecific communication is required, and a Shrine letter can be, and is.\nproduced without delay. It will be obvious to the reader what part.\nMr. Damodar may have played in the proceedings; and that for these\nparticular phenomena an opening in the back of the Shrine would ha,'e\nbeen unnecessary.\nIt had been alleged, indeed, that when Ma.dame Blavatsky was at.\nMa.dras, instantaneous replies to mental queries ha.d been found in the\nShrine, that envelopes containing questions were returned absolutely\nintact to the senders, and that when they were opened replies were\nfound within in the handwriting of a Mahatma.. After numerous\ninquiries I found that in all the cases I could hear of, the mental query\nwas such as might easily have been anticipated by Madame Blavatsky;\nindeed, the quei'Y generally WI\\S whether the questioner would meet\nwith any success in his endeavour to become a pupil of the Mahatma,\nand the answer was frequently of the indefinite and oracular sort.\nIn some cases the envelope inserted in the Shrine was one which\nhad been previously sent to hea.dquarters for that purpose, so that the\nenvelope might have been opened and the answer written therein\nbefore it was placed in the Shrine at all. Where sufficient care was\ntaken in the preparation of the inquiry, either no specific answer was\nDigitized by Google\n\f01, Phenomena connected with TheosopllU. 249\ngiven or the answer was delayed. Mr. Ezekiel, Theosophist of Poon\",\nhas described to me the details of a case where he received a.\nMahatma communicil.tion intended to be a reply to a specific question\nwhich he had asked. These details entirely corroborate my conclusion\ncons:erning Madame Blavatsky, but Mr. Ezekiel is umvilling that they\nshould be published; he has given me permission, however, to state\nthat the following passage which occurs in Madame Coulomb's\npamphlet (p. 73) is quite justified.\nr.There is another phenomenon which I nluat mention, because it took\nplace in the presence of Mr. Ezekiel, whom I shall have to mention again\nlater. At the time of the Anniversary, among the many delegates that came\non this occasion was the above gentleman. He was in company with others\nin MadanIe's apartment when a letter fell from the ceiling. Mr. Ezekiel\nformed the natural supposition that it must have been pulled down by somo\ncontrivance, so he went and unburdened his heart to several Fellows of the\nSociety, giving t1rla as a great secret. However, although a secret, it came\nto Madame's ears and she immediately asked my husband to take out the\nscrew-rings through which tlte string had passed, and stop tlte holes witlt 0.\nlittle paint to remove all traces; this done, she called some one to show\nhow ridiculous the accusation had been.\"\nThis letter fell in Madame Blavatsky's sitting-room, and was probably\narranged in the same way as the\" phenomenal\" letter prepared for me\nby the Ooulombs, which was described in the April number of the\nJowrnal, in the words of a letter written by me from India, as\nfollows :-\nMadras, Jaullary 9th, 1885.\nThis morning I called upon the Coulombs, who are living at the house\nof :Mrs. Dyer in St. Thom~. I conversed a short time with M. Coulomb\nbefore Madame Coulomb appeared. In the course of the conversation tllat\nfollowed I remarked, concerning certain cases of premonition, that I had 110\nsatisfactory theory at present to account for them. At t1rla nloment some-\nthing white appeared, touching my hair, and fell on the 1100r. It was a\nletter. I picked it up. It was addre88ed to myseH. M. and Madame\nCoulomb were sitting near me and in front of me. I had observed no motion\non their part which could account for tlte appearance of tlte letter. Examin-\ning the ceiling as I stood I could detect no ftaw ; it appeared intact. 011\nopening the letter, I found it referred to the conversation which had JUSt;\ntaken place. I transcribe the words :-\n\"Because the existing cause of to-day foretells the effect of tN-morrow\n-0. bud aBSures us beforehand the full-blown rose of to-morrow; on seeing\na fine field of corn in which are buried eggs of locusts, we are to foresee that\nthat corn will never enter tlle granary; by tlte appearan~e of consumptive\nfatlter and scrofulous mother a sickly child can be foretold.. Now all these\ncauses, which bring to us these effects, have in their turn tlteir effects them-\ns\nDigitized by Google\n\f250 MI'.

Coulomb then described the origin of the letter.\nA large beam supported the ceiling, and resting on this, at right angles\nto it, was a series of small beams WIth spaces between them. These spaces\nwere filled with blocks of wood, with mortar to keep them in place. Part\nof this mortar had been scraped out on the top of the large beam and between\ntwo smaller ones, 80 that a letter could be inserted and lie flat on the top of\nthe large beam. Round the letter was twice passed a piece of thread of the\nBanle colour as the ceiling. One end of the thread remained loose on the\nletter, the other end was in the htmd of a person outside the room. The\nthread ran from the letter, close to the ceiling, passed outside and hunS\ndown. I was sitting under the main beam. The subject of conversation\nwas led up to, and at the given signal (a call to the dog) the confederate in\nthe verandah beyond pulled the thread and the letter fell. The confederate\ndrew the thread entirely away and left the spot. The crevice for the\nletter might, in a few moments, have been stopped up and covered with\ndust, 80 that no aperture whatever appeared in the neighbourhood of the\nceilin~l\nThe ceiling of Madame Blavatsky's sitting-room was constructed in\nthe same way as the one here described, and would, therefore, be suited\nfor the occurrence of similar phenomena. Besides the letter receh-ed\nby Mr. Ezekiel, the letter mentioned in Appendix V. also fell in this\nroom. I examined the beam, and observed a crevice well suited for the\nproduction of the phenomenon; this crevice was still in existence when\nI left Madras.\nIn connection with phenomenal incidents various envelopes have\nbeen shown to me by Theosophists which were supposed to have been\ncompletely fastened, but from all of these the contents might have heen\nin my opinion even more easily a.bstracted than from the sealed\nenvelope described in detail in Appendix V., which presented clear\ntraces of having been surreptitiously opened by the withdrawal of the\nright fiap, which had just esca.ped being securely held, if held at all,\nby the wu. In the case of one large sealed envelope shown to me by\na prominent native Theosophist, the wax held the upper and lower\nflaps only, and hardly came within a quarter of an inch of the side\nflaps; the crumpling suggested that the right fiap here also had heen\nwithdrawn.\nAfter :Madame Blavatsky's departure for Europe the Mahatma\ncommunications-with the two exceptions already mentioned-were\nfound, not in the Shrine, but in various other places about the house,\nchiefly the office-room. The accounts of many cases of this kind were\npublished in our First Report. I made careful inquiriC!S concerning\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Pllenomena connected trith 1'lle08ophg. 251\nall of them, and found that in every instance the letter might have been\neasily placed by Mr. Damodar.\nIn one case mentioned by Mr. Babajee, where he found a letter upon\nhis desk in the office-room, he wrote :-\n\" On approaching my desk, I saw diBtinctly an envelope and paper\nforming themselves.\" In his account to me, however, he says only that\n\" the letter appeared to increase in size as he approached his desk\" !\nThere are, I think, only two instances among those given in our\nFirst Report, where the modUlI operandi, if Mr. Damodar were the\nagent, will not be obvious, and I shall briefly describe these.\nOur evidence for them is an account written by Mr. Babajee and\nforwarded through Dr Hartmann to Mr. Myers for the Committee,\nand after what I have said as to the value of Mr. Babajee's evidence, it\nmay seem unnecessary to investigate them further. Still, as they seem\nto me-the second especially-to form an interesting sample of the\nkind of evidence which is apparently thought at the headquarters of\nthe Theosophical Society to be valuable, I will give them. The first is\nas follows:-\n.. On or about the 1st Augult, 1884, I was examining whether the wrap-\npers addTe888d to luhlcribers (to The TheoIophilt) were correct, sitting in the\nroom next to our office-room; on a large camp table were Ipread the\naddressed wrappen. With lOme noise fell a heavy packet (with a covering\nletter to me) 011 the wrapperl. The letter contained lome wholesome and\ntimely advice to me, and directed me to hand over the packet to Mr. St.\nGeorge Lane-Fox. I accordingly gave it, and found that in tho packet was a\nChinese envelope and letter addressed both to Dr. F. Hartmann and to Mr.\nLane-Fox. When the packet fell on my table, there was nobody then in the\nroom or in the office-room. I was alone. The letter and contents were in\nthe well-known handwritings of Mahatma Koot Hoomi and of B.D.S.\"\nI found from Mr. Babajee that 1\\lr. Damodar was reclining on a.\ncouch outside the office-room, and adjoining its door. Mr. Babajee was\nsittillg with his back turned partly towards the direction of the spot\noccupied by Mr. Damodar, ill such a position that 110 movement of\nMr. Damodar's nl'ed have been observed by him. The two rooms are\ndivided by a partition about seven feet high, the lower part 0 which\nis zinc, the upper part being formed of wire trellis-work. The rooms\nare twice as high as the partition. An object might easily be thrown\nfl\u00b7om the office-room entrance so as to fall 011 the table.\nThe othcr case is the following :-\n.. M. R. Ry. G. Sreenivas Row Garu, Sule Registrar of Cumbum,\nKurnool District, India, wrote a letter, dated 15th Jtmuary, 1884, to the\naddreSl of Damodar, who gave it to me for reply. Early in the morning, at\n'1 a.m., I arranged all the papers to be IUlIwered on my desk, with which\n8 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f252 J[I\". Hodgsoll's Report\nnobody ever interferes. I put this letter of Sreeniv88 Row in a prominent\nplace on the table, and then after locking the office-room and taking the key\nwith myself, I went out to take a bath; at about 8 a.m. I returned and\nopened the office door; on approaching my table, what do I find 7 Endorse-\nment on Sreeniv88 Row's letter in blue pencil, in the handwriting of\nMahatma K.B., ordering me to answer the letter. There is not the least\npossibility of doubt in this case.\"\nAfter reading this, what was my surprise to find that the room\nwhich I have just described, next to the office-room, and divided from\nit only by the partition reachmg half-way to the ceiling, was never\nlocked, and that there is no lock to the door, while a child might climb\nfrom the table over the partition into the office-room! Truly \"there is\nnot the least possibility of doubt in this case\" that the phenomenon\nmight have been produced by normal means.\nVarious other letter-phenomena which were mentioned in our First\nReport, had occurred at the headquarters in Bombay. Several letters\nhad fallen in the guest-chamber, which adjoined Madame. Blavatsky's\nbedroom, in Crow's Nest Bungalow. Among these were the phenomena\nrecounted by Professor Smith, Mr. Shroff, and Mr. Bal Nilaji Pitale\n(see \"Hints on Esoteric Theosophy\"), and that described by Mr.\nSinnett in \"The Occult World,\" fourth edition, p. 120. The ceiling of\nthis room is boarded, not plastered; and the remark which we made\nin our First Report, that all accounts of letters faIling in such\nplaces must be regarded with suspicion, I found to be quite justified.\nIn Mr. Shroff's account it is stated that the wooden ceiling of the\nroom was perfectly inwt. Mr. Shroff informed me that the account\nwas drawn up in the first instance by himself, and tbt afterwards\nsome passages were added and alterations made at the suggestion\nof others present. He did not appear to have made any \"examination\" ;\nhe said that he had \"looked up at the ceiling,\" that he had been posi-\ntive beforehand about the genuineness of the phenomena, and that he\ndid not care to scrutinise with the eye of a critic.\nM. Coulomb asserted, before I went to Bombay, tha.t in a garret\naboye this room a tra.p was fixed with a string running from it into\nanother room. The letter was placed in the trap just above one of the\ninterstices between the boards of the ceiling, and on a given signal, the\nstring was pulled and the letter fell. On one occasion, when Judge\nGadgill was present, the trap would not work, and M. Coulomb\nhad himself ascended the garret and pushed the letter down. He\ndescribed the garret particularly, the entrance to which is through a\n1;rap-door in the ceiling of Madame Blavatsky's bedroom. The trap, he\nasserted, was taken away when Judge Gadgill desired to inspect the\ngarret. The case where Judge Gadgill was present is mentioned by\nDigitized by Google\n\f011 Phenomena cOilnected fDitll 1'heo8ojJlIY. 253\nOolonel Olcott in his deposition, but as there given, is likely to be very\nmisleading. He said :-\n\"Judge Gadgill, and one or two others, knowing that they had to deal\nwith some very difficult sceptics at Baroda, who would demand if they had\ntaken the precaution to examine the premises and see if the letter could\nhave been delivered by any mechanical device, thereupon made a search of\nthe place, and even got a ladder and went upon the tiled roof. He will tell\nyou that the examination made then, and a subsequent and more careful one,\nwhich was made in my own presence and with my aaaistance-for I held the\nladder-left no ground for suspicion of bad faith.\"\nNow the tiled roof spoken of was above the garret, and there is not\nthe slightest trace of any suspicious circumstance discoverable from\nthere. Moreover, part of the hill very closely adjoins the bungalow, so\nthat it is but a short step from the bank to the tiled roof, and to speak\nof getting a ladder and going upon the tiled roof is quite as absurd as\nto speak of getting a ladder and going upon the sofa.\nAccording to M. Ooulomb, when Mr. Gadgill requested to examine\nthe garret Madame Bla.vatsky ordered the only available ladder to be\nhidden, so that Mr. Gadgill was unable to examine the garret at the\ntime; and before he made his \"subsequent and more careful\" exami-\nnation, having obtained a ladder for the purpose, M. Coulomb had\nremoved the trap, filled the interstices with bits of bamboo and stick\n~d dust, and endeavoured to make the garret look as though it had\nLeen entirely undisturbed for a long time.\nAfter my return from Bombay, Oolonel Olcott gave me another\naccount of the incident,. in which he said that he was not at Bombay\nwhen the letter fell; that he was told that Judge Gadgill went on the\ntiled roof; that it was a week or so later when Judge GadgiJI examined\nthe garret; that he (Oolonel Olcott) held the ladder to steady it, as it\nwas placed on a table to enable the trap-door to be reached, and that he\ntold Judge Gadgill to first look at the jowings of the boards and see if\nthey were not choked with cobwebs, dust, &c., thus showing that they\n\u2022 Another statement made by Colonel Olcott in his deposition concerning\nthe above incident is worthy of remark. He said: .. One of thOlle present\nsuddenly called attention to a collection of vapour that had that instant\nappeared in the air up towards the comer of the room ; and all present, looking,\nsaw this take the form of a letter.\" The letter which feU was addressed, \"To\nTookaram and Others,\" according to the account given to me by Mr. Tookaram\nTatya himself (\" merchant and commission'agent, and the active member\nworking at the Hommopathic Charitable Dispensary established at Bombay\nunder the auspices of the Theosophical Society, and practising mesmerism in\nits curative branch both at home and at the dispensary\"). Concerning the fall\nof the letter, Mr. Tookaram states: .. The grandson of Iyalu Naidu said he\nsaw a flash of light near the ceiling, which contracted into a letter, and fell\nfluttering on the floor. I saw the letter just as it struck the floor.\"\nHow a little dust can blind one's eyea !\nDigitized by Google\n\f254 Mr. Hodgson', Report\ncould not have been used for pushing letters through. I neglected to\nask Colonel Olcott whether this suggestion originated from himself or\nfrom Madame Blavatsky.\nI examined carefully, when I was at Bombay, the room and the\ngarret, the entrance to which is through a trap-door in the ceiling of\nwhat was Madame Blavatsky's bedroom. The appearance of the\ngarret corresponded so accurately with M. Coulomb's detailed descrip-\ntion as to convince me that he was familiar with it. Some of the\ninterstices in the ceiling were open; others had evidently been carefully\nfilled with bits of stick and dust, and I dropped severa1 pieces of\nbamboo which I found in the garret, and which were more than a\nquarter of an inch thick, through one of the interstices. A copy of our\nProceeding, might easily have been pushed through, and interstices\nwere plainly visible in the ceiling from oolow. I was unfortunately\nnnable to see Judge Gadgill himself, but after my examination of the\nroom I felt that he could probably have added little important evidence.\nThere were also instances of objects falling in a room roofed by a.\nceiling-cloth, which was occupied by Colonel Olcott in another house; one\nof these (from \"Hints on Esoteric Theosophy\") was given in our First\nReport. I did not see this room, but Colonel Olcott, in reply to my\ninquiries, informed me that no examination of the ceiling-cloth was made,\nso that Madame Coulomb's statement that the card which came fluttering\ndown was pushed from above througb a slit made in the ceiIing-cloth is\nvery probably correct.\n, _)3ut cases had occurred, not only of the appearance, but of the\ndisappearance of lettel'S. Chief among these was the disappearance of\nthe packet in the Vega. case. This incident is described in \"Hints on\nEsoteric Theosophy.\" It was alleged that a letter was conveyed by IL\nMahatma from Mr. Eglinton on the steanlship Vega., between Colombo\nand Aden, to Madame Blavatsky at Bombay, and again from Bombay\nto Mrs. Gordon at Howrah. It is clear from the account of this\noccurrence, as we pointed out in our First Report, that there was no\nproof whatever of identity between the letter received at Bombay and\nthat shown on the Vega.. The fall of the letter in Bombay is somewhat\nstrangelydescribed in the following certificate. (See\" Hints on Esoteric\nTheosophy.\")\n\" At 8 p.m. (Bombay time), on Friday, the 24tll March, 1882, we were\nspending our time with Madanle Blavatllky in the room as the wind was\nblowing powerfully outaide. )[adame told us that she felt that something\nwould occur. The whole party, consisting of 7 persons, then adjourned\non the terrace, and within a few minutes after our being there we saw a\nletter drop as if from under the roof above. Some of us saw the letter\ncoming slanting from one direction and drop quite opp<>aite to where it came\nfrom. The letter, on being opened, was found to contain a closed envelope\nDigitized by Google\n\f011 Phenomena cOJlnected witn 1'heoaoplly. 255\nto the address of Mrs. Gordon, Bowrah; on the reverse side were three\ncrosses ttt in pencil. The envelope was of bluish colour and thin. The open\nletter written in red pencil contained certain instructions to Madame\nBlavatsky, and accordingly she put the envelope, together with three visiting\ncards, and strung them all with a blue thread of silk and put the packet as\ndirected on a bookcase, and within 5 minutes after it was put there it\nevaporated, to our no small surprise.\n\"K.

Nagnath and Mr. Bhavani Shankar, whom I\nquestioned at Madras, could give but little additional information.\n:Mr. Martandrao said that he first saw the letter in the air at about\n10 feet from the door. Mr. Bhavani (concerning whom see p. 261 and\nAppendix IX.) said that he first saw the letter as it st\\-uck the door of\nthe verandah, that it contained an enclosure to Madame Blavatsky\nbeginning \" Old woman get up,\" and ordering her to get some cards\nof her own, and sew them up with the letter with green thread, and\nput the packet on the top of a large cupboard; that the packet was\nplaced there as directed, and in about one minute afterwards it had\ndisappeared. Mr. Shroff, whom I saw in Bombay, was unable at first\nto recollect the incident at all, and when he did recollect it, was unable\nto give me any details.\nMr. Dorab H. Bharucha, medical student, whom I also saw in\nBombay, said, in reply to my inquiries, that he saw the letter in the air,\nthat when he first saw the letter it was close to the branches of a\nneighbouring tree, and that it came in such a way that it might have\nbeen thrown from the tree. It should be noticed that no opportunity\nwas given to any of the witnesses to place any test marks on the packet.if.\n\u2022 Itis the more important to notice this, because in describing the incident\nin .. The Occult WorId,\" 4th ed., p. 132, Mr. Sinnett says the cards were\"written\non by them at the time,\" an exprelllion which certainly suggests that some one\nbesides Madame Blavatsky had written on them. That this was not the case\nmay be inferred from the above aecounts. Moreover, Mrs. Gordon describes the\nwriting on the cards received at Howrah, but makes no allusion to any except\nthat of Madame Blavatsky and llahatmas Koot Hoomi and 1\\1.. so that jf\nothers did write on them at Bombay there was .. want of correspondencebetween\nthe cards seen at Bombay, and those Reen at Howrah.\nDigitized by Google\n\f256 NI'. Hoagson'8 Report\nIt was to Madame Bla\u00a5&tsky herself that the instructions were given\nill \"the open letter written in red pencil.\" Mr. Bharucha has given me\nfurther details which throw some light upon the e\\'aporation of the\npacket. The whole party entered Madame BlaY80tsky's sitting-room\nafter the letter was taken up j and when Madame Blavatsky had ful\u00b7\nfilled ber (own) instructions, and placed the packet on the bookcase,\nthe whole party left the room. Several minutes elapsed before they\nreturned to the room, and when they returned the packet had dis-\nappeared. lIr. Bharucha described the position of the bookcase where\nthe letter was placed, giving me a pencil sketch of the room. He did\nnot know that any opening existed on that side of the room where the\nbookcase was situated, and was unaware that the bookcase stood im-\nmediately in front of a double venetianed door, which communicates\nwith a sort of alley, part of which formed Babula's room. That this\nwas so I had ascertained by my own examination of the room at Crow's\nNest Bungalow. Probably the top portion of the venetianed door may\nhave been by some means concealed from view. M. Coulomb asserts\nthat it was hidden by a piece of carpeting, and this would account fOI'\nMr. Bharucha's not noticing it. The venetian spaces of this door are\nvery wide and allow the hand and most of the forearm to be thrust\nthrough. I presume,therefore, that the evaporation which astonished the\nwitnesses-I should perhaps say the non-witnesses-was due not so\nmuch to the volatile nature of the packet itself, as to the protrusile\ncapacity of Babula's hand. As to the fall of what purported to be the\nsame letter at Howrah, in the presence of Colonel Olcott and Colonel\nand lIrs. Gordon, in the room which had been occupioo by llr.\nEglinton, it may of course have been accomplished by a confederate,\nin one of the ways already described.}\nOther instances of \" phenomenal\" letters will be found mentioned in\nAppendices XII., XIII. and XIV. It remains only to add here that in\nthose cases where the immediately previous subject of conversation waS\nreferred to in the Mahatma communication, there is no difficulty in\nsupposing that the special topic was led up to by Madame Blavatsky.\n\"TUE OCCULT 'YORLD\" PUENOllENA.\nThe phenomena described by Mr. Sinnettin .. The Occult 'Vorld\" now\ndemand consideration. And first I shall deal with several cases\nselected by Mr. Sinnett in his deposition to the Committee, as these\nwere presumably thought by him to be of special importance. The first\ncase described by Mr. Siunett to the Committee was that of a letter\nwhich he had written to Koot Hoomi.\n.. Having completed the note, I put it into an envelope, and took it t()\nMadame Blavataky, who was sitting in the drawing-room witll my wife. 1\nDigitized by Google\n\f011 Phenomena connected fritl, Theosoph!l. 257\nsaid to her, \u2022 'Will you get that taken, if you can, and get me an answer 7'\nShe put the letter into her pocket, and rose to go to her room. All the\nwindows were open, as is usual in India. As she paBBed out I walked to\nthe drawing-room door. She was out of my sight but for an instant of time~\nwhen she cried out, 'Oh, he has taken it from me now.' I will undertake\nto say that she was not out of my sight for 10 seconds. Having uttered\nthat exclamation, she returned to the drawing-room, and we then proceeded\ntogether to my office at the back of my house. I went on with what I was\ndoing, and she simply lay on the sofa in my full view. She remained there.\nperhaps, for between 5 or 10 minutes, when, suddenly lifting her head\nfrom the pillow, she pointed to it and said, \u2022There is your letter.' I should\nmention, as a little fact which may bear upon occult physics, that the moment\nbefore I distinctly heard a peculiar rushing sound through the air. It was, I\nthink, the only occasion on which I had heard such a sound, and she asked\nme afterwards if I had heard it. The letter lay on the pillow, the name-\nwhich I had written on the envelope being scratched out, and my own name\nwritten immediately above it. The envelope was unopened, and in precisely\nthe same state, with the difference I have mentioned, as when I gave it to\nMadame Blavatsky. I cut the envelope open, and found inside an answer\nto the question which I had asked the Mahatma.\"\nFrom this account it appears that Madame Blavatsky was not out\nof 1olr. Sinnett's sight for ten seconas, but in the account given in\n\"The Occult WorId\"(pp. 96-97) Mr. Sinnett undertakes to say only that\nshe had Dot been away to her own room t\/'irty seconds, admitting that\nshe was also out of his sight for a minute or two in Mrs. Sinnett's room.\n'After this I cannot feel certain that Madame Blavatsky may not ha\"e\nbeen absent in her own room considerably more than 30 seconds, nor\ndo I feel certain that Madame Blavatsky nlay not have retired to some\nother room during the interval of \"a few minutes II which Mr.\nSinnett assigns to her conversation with Mrs. Sinnett in the adjoining\nroom. Even apart from this uncertainty, I cannot attach any impor-\ntance to the case after finding that on my second trial I could open a.\nfinnly closed ordinary adhesive envelope under such conditions as are\ndescribed by Mr. Sinnett, read the enclosed note and reply to it, the\nquestion and the reply being as long as those of Mr. Sinnett's, and\nre-close the envelope, leaving it apparently in the same condition as\nbefore, in one minute; and it appears to me quite possible that Madame\nBIl\\vatsky, with her probably superior skill and practice, might have\neasily performed the task in 30 seconds. I do not suppose that Mr_\nSinnett would wish to maintain that the \"peculiar rushing sound\nthrough the air\" could not hale been produced by ordinary means at,\nthe disposal of Madame Blavatsky.\nThe next case mentioned by Mr. Sinnett was the fall of a letter in\nthe guest-room at Crow's Nest Bungalow, and is thus described in his\ndeposition.\nDigitized by Google\n\f268 Mr. Hodg8on'8 Report\n\" I had been expecting a letter from Keot Hoomi, but on my arrival at\nBombay I did not find one awaiting me at the headquarters of the Theo-\nsophical Society there. I had written, 88king him seversl questions. I bad\ngot in late at night, and on the following morning I WIIS walking about the\nverandah talking to Madame Blavatsky. We went into a room which I bad\noccupied 88 a bedroom during the night-a big room, with 1\\ large table ill the\nmiddle of it. I sat down while we were talking, and she occupied another\nchair at a considerable distance from me. I said, 'Why 011 earth have I\nnot had a letter in answer to mine l' She replied, 'Perhaps he will send it\nto you. Try to exercise your will-power; try to appeal to him. Ask him\nto lend it to you.I I retorted, ' No, I will wait his time ; he will send 800ner\n001' later, no doubt.' At that moment a packet fell beford me on the table.\nIt W88 a large envelope containing at It!88t 30 pages of manuscript--hea\\'Y\ndraft paper. The packet only came into view a few feet-two perhapa-\nabove the table, though I do not attach much importance to the precise\ndistance, 88 in a case of that sort the eye cannot be certain to 1\\ foot. The\nroom W88 brilliantly light, this being in the morning.\nMR. GL\"1UiBY: Did Madame Blavataky know that you bad written\na letter and were expecting an answer, before this conversation with her I\nMR. SINNETI' : Certainly ; but the point to which I attach importance in\nthis case is that the thing happened in broad daylight in a room which I had\nmyself occupied the previous night, and which I had been in and out of\nduring the whole of the morning. Everything occurred fully before my eyel.\nIt is impoaaible that Madame Blavatsky could have throWn the letter with\n)ler hand. All the circumstances are incompatible with that. I W88 not\nwriting at the time, but talking to her, 80 that the idea that abe could ha,-e\nthrown the letter islimply preposterous. (See\" The Occult World,\" p. 120.)\nIt might be suggested that the remarks made by Madame Blava.tsky\nwel\"e calculated to render this phenomenon more striking than it\nactually was if Mr. Sinnett could have been prevailed upon to \" exercise\nhis will power,\" and it is to be inferred from Mr. Sinnett's accounts that\nhe made no examination whatever of the ceiling either from the room\nbelow or from the garret above. According to M. Coulomb the packet had\nbeen arranged in the trap in the garret before the arrival of Mr. Sinnett\noOn the previous evening, but as Mr. Sinnett was late in arriving, the\nphenomenon was deferred until the following morning. The room where\nthe letter fell has already been described (p. 254), and the incident needs\nno further comment.\nThe third case was tha.t of a sealed envelope, a case which Mr.\nSinnett seems to have regarded as \"quite complete,\" in his deposi-\ntion to the Committee. (See \"The Occult World,\" pp. 95-96.) This\nenvelope, which contained n. letter for the Brothers, and which\nMr. Sinnett, after gumming and sealing,had given to Madame Blavatsky,\nwas in Madame Blavatsky's possession for several hours, and when it was\nreturned to Mr. Sinnett, he found it \"absolutely intact, its ,-ery complete\nfastenings ha,-ing l\"emained just as\" he had arranged them. Cutting\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Plumomella cOlmected feitll Theoaopllu. 259\ntl1e envelope open, Mr. Sinnett found inside, not only the lettel' it had\npreviously contained, but also another, from Koot Hoomi. ?tIr. Sinnett\nshowed nle the envelope. The fastenings were not by any means\nwhat I should mIl complete; so far was this from being the case, that\nowing to the length of the flap, which was only sealed at its lower\nextremity, the letter might have been abstracted, and re-inserted with\nother letters, without even steaming the envelope, or loosening the\nadhesion of the gum by any other process; and if the gum had been\nloosened, say by careful steaming, the abstraction and re-insertion would\nhave been superlatively easy.\nf'The last case given by Mr. Sinnett in his deposition to the Com-\nmittee, and emphasised by him as a \"phenomenal test,\" is the\nalleged instantaneous transportation of a. piece of plaster ploqu.e\nfrom Bombay to Allahabad. (\"The Occult World,\" pp. 126-131.) The\nimportant facts are briefly these. Colonel Olcott, accompanied by Mr.\nBhavani Rao (now Inspector of the N.W. Theosophical branches), was\non his way from Bombay to Calcutta, and was staying with Mr. Sinnett\nat Allahabad on the route. One evening, on his return home, ~fr.\nSinnett found, in one of several telegram envelopes awa.iting him, a note\nfrom Mahatma M., telling him to search in his writing-room for \"0.\nfragment of a plaster bas-relief that M. had just transported instan-\ntaneously from Bombay.\" Mr. Sinnett found the fragment in the\ndrawer of his writing-table. A document signed at Bombay shows that\nsomewhere about the same time as Mr. Sinnett got this note a loud\nnoise, as of something falling and breaking, was heard by several\npersons as they sat in the verandah adjoining Madame Blavatsky's\nwriting-room. A search was immediately made in this l'OOm, which\nproved to be empty, but a certain plaster mould was found lying in\npieces on the floor. On fitting the pieces together, it was found that\none fragment was missing. Shortly afterwards Madame Blavatsky\nwent into her other room and shut the door. After a minute's interva.l,\nshe called Mr. Tookaram Tatyo. and showed him a paper containing the\nhandwriting of \"Mahatma M.,\" which informed them that the\nmissing piece had been taken to Allahabad. The remaining pieces\nwere sent a few days later to Mr. Sinnett, and he found that his piece\n\"fitted in perfectly.\" Of course, the weak point of the case is that\nthere is no proof whatever that the piece of plastel' received by l\\fr.\nSinnett was in Bombay when the peculiar breakage OCCUl-red, for it\nappears from the statement of the witnesses at BombllY (shown to us\nby Mr.Sinnett, but not printed complete in \"The Occult World \") that\nthe only evidence for the previously unbroken condition of the plaster\nmould is that \"Madame Blavatsky on inquiry ascertained ['1 from the\nservants that 0.11 the furniture had been cleaned and dusted two clays\nbefore, and the port-mit was intact then.\"\nDigitized by Google\n\f260 Mr. Hodgso-n's Rtpol't\nWhat at'rangements would be necessary for the phenomenon if it was\n11. trick? 1\\I8.(1ameBlavatsky,we maysuppose,begins by breaking offa corner\nof the plaster mould,and in so doing breaks thE' mould into several pieces.\nAfter some difficulties, M. Ooulomb fits tht> pieces together-all but\none-and keeps them in place by a strip of cardboard frame fastened in\nsuch 1\\ manner that it can be jerked away by a string pulled from out-\nside the room where the mould was suspended. The cardboard strip\ncontaining the mould is arranged on the nail. As M. Ooulomb is going\nwith Madame Ooulomb to Poon&., he instructs Babula how to pull the\nstring.* The fragment of plaster withheld is given (or sent) to some\nconfederate to be placed in Mr. Sinnett's drawer, together with a note\nill the handwl'iting of \" Mahatma M.,\" which is to be placed, if possible,\nin some \"closed\" envelope at Mr. Sinnett's house; an hour is agreed\nupon, say 7 p.m., March 11th, Bombay time, and at the appointed\nhour, Babula pulls the string,the plaster falls with a crash, and witnesses\nare there to hear the noise and fit the fragments together. Madame\nBlavatsky enters her inner room alone and provides a Mahatma note.\n:Meanwhile, the confederate has succeeded in inserting the note in \"\ntelegram en\"elope (possibly by careful manipulation of the eyelets which\nare used to fasten telegram envelopes in India; possibly by substituting\neyelets S~ihtly larger, so as to cover any flaws made in the paper of the\nenvelo~ .\nTo t 1 same confederate may have been confided the two Koot\nHoomi notes received by Mr. Sinnett while Mr. Bhavani Rao was at\nAllahaba.cl. There is most assuredly nothing in those portions of the\nfirst of these which Mr. Sinnett quotes (\" Occult World,\" p. 130)\nwhich might not have been written beforehand, and the second might\nwell, so fat\u00b7 as appears from Mr. Sinnett's acCOWlt of its contents, have\nbeen prepared in anticipation of Mr. Sinnett's suggestioIlll. It simply\nsaid, Mt\u00b7. Sinnett tells us, \"that what I proposed was impossible, and\nthat he [Koot Hoomi] would write more fully through Bonlbay.\"t This\n\u2022 1.1. Coulomb declares that the arrangements were as here described.\nt From a contemporary account of the occurrence sent by Mr. Sinnett to\n:Mr. Hume, on llarch 14th, and from the copy of \"contemporary letter written\nI.)\" Colonel Olcott to Madame Blavatsky on March 12th, it would appear that on\nMarch 11th Mr. Sinnett put a note addressed to MaAatma M. into his drawer,\nfrom which on l.larch 12th it bad disappeared. But there is no mention of any\nnote to Koot Hoomi except the one given to Mr. Bha\"ani Rao on the 13th, and\nit i8 intpIied in a copy of a letter from Mr. Bhavani Rao to Mr. Damodar on\nMarch l..t1I, that this was the first letter which he had received for\" trans-\nD\\i~ion .. to a \"Brother.\" Is it possible that there is a nustake in \"The Occult\nWorld,\" and that by the first note to Koot Hoomi is really meant the note to\nM. put into the drawer! The documents which I have mentioned point clearly\nto this conclusion. '''nat see1Rs to have happened during Mr. Bha\"ani Roo's\n\"isit is that llr.

If it be objected to my\nexplanation of these Allahabad phenomena that the only possible con-\nfederate was Mr. Bhavani Ra.o himself, I must reply that I cannot\nregard this objection as an important one. I have already shown\ngrounds for believing that Madame Blavatsky has obtained sufficient\ninfluence over two educated young natives to induce them to join her\nin tricks, and from what I know of Mr. Bhava.ni Rao, or, as he is more\ngenerally called, Bhavani Shankar, whose acquaintance I made while I\nwas in India., I can find no improbability in the supposition of his being\na. third. I have given in Appendix IX., and in Part II., p. 29i, what\nI regard as instances of deliberate misrepresentation on his part.\nI pass now to the remaining phenomena mentioned by Mr. Sinnett\nin \"The Occult World.\" We may first take the \"raps\" and the \"astral\nbells,\" which Mr. Sinnett seems to regard as constituting important\ntest phenomena. I may here quote a passage from \"The Occult\nWorld,\" p. 35:-\n\"With such a mighty problem at stake as the trustworthineBB of\nthe fundamental theories of modern physical science, it is impossible\nonly dill lIe get no reply whatever at the time to this note, 1mt it lel1 to no\neommunieation of any sort at the time from MaAatma M.; he received, however,\na. K. H. communication. on March 12th, and on March 13th addreBSed a letter to\nKoot Hoomi in which he suggested that certain otherthings should be done, and\nwhich he gave to Mr. Bhavani Rao to be \"transmitted.\" On March 14th, he\nreceived from Mr. Bhavani Rao a K.H. communication which merely said,\n\"impoBBible; no power; will write through Bombay.\" The lateRt fonn of this\nincident as published by Mr. Sinnett occurs in the Appendix to the fourth edition\nof \"The Occult World,\" p.I55, where, referring to Mr. Bha,'ani Rao, he writes:\n.. During the visit I speak of, he was enabled to pass a letter of mine to the\nMaster, to receive back his reply, to get off a second note of mine, and to receive\nback a little note of a few words in reply again.\" I find it imposl'ible to reconcile\nthis account with the documents which I have mentioned, and it appears also to\ndiffer slightly from the account which Mr. Sinnett gives on p. 130, from which I\ninfer that the note which he says he wrote to Koot Hoomi and gave to Mr.\nBhavani Rao on March IIth, was not all8'Wered by the Koot Hoomi note presented\nby Mr. Bhavani Rao on March 12th. If I anI right in this inference I may\nventure to make another, and that is that Mr. Sinnett was himself dissatisfied\nat not receiving, in Koot Hoomi's communication of March 12th, a reply to hiB\nletter of March lith, and that when he wrote the words that he did, after all,\nexchl\\Jlge letters with Koot Hoomi, it was with the feeling that his dissatisfac-\ntion bad been partly if not altogether remo,'ed by the final Koot Hoomi note.\nDoes Mr. Sinnett think that this final note referred so specially to his own\nsuggestions that it could not have been prepared before his own letter was\n,,'ritten! In this ease it would be interesting to know the exaet words of\nboth documents, and to examine the handwriting of the Koot Hoollli reply.\nDigitized by Google\n\f262 MI'. Hodgson's Rt'port\nto proceed by any other but scientific modes of investigation. In any\nexperimenta I have tried I have always been careful to exclude, not\nmerely the probability, but the poBBibility of trickery; and where it has\nbeen impoBBible to secure the proper conditions, I have not allowed the\nresulta of the experimenta to enter into the sum total of my conclusions.\"\nThat Mr. Sinnett looks upon the cases we have just considered in\ndetail as instances of the passage of matter through matter or of its pre-\nprecipitation or reintegration, forces me to the opinion that his modes\nof investigation have not been what I should call \"scientific,\" and that\nthe same lack of due caution probably characterised his observation of\ntest-conditions in those instances which I have not been able to investi-\ngate personally, as in those instances where I have had the opportunity\nof examining the conditions applied. Thus, for example, I have not taken\npart in forming a pile of hands such as Mr. Sinnett describes on p. 33,\nbut I cannot attribute any importance to his confident statement\nconcerning this and similar incident&, now that I have examined some\nof the posaibilities in other cases about which he speaks with equal, if\nnot greater, confidence. The raps occurring when Madame Blavatsky\nplaces her hands upon the patient's head, I have, however, experienced,\n-though, as }Iadame Blavatsky sat behind me and placed ~her hands\nupon the back of my head, I was unable to watch her fingers.\nShe had not informed me what she intended doing, and I conjectured\nthat she was attempting to \"mesmerise\" me; the so-called \"shocks\"\nwhich I felt impressed me simply as movements of impatience on\nthe part of Madame Blavatsky. My attention being then drawn to them\nas \"phenomena,\" they were repeated, but I found them not at all like\nthe\" shocks\" experienced when taking offsparks from the conductor of\nan electrical machine, as Mr. Sinnett describes them. The sharp thrilling\nor tingling feeling was quite absent. Unfortunately, I am unable to\ngently crack any of the joints of my fingers, I can but clumsily and\nundisguisedly crack one of the joints of my thumbs, yet I find that the\nquality of the feeling produced when I thus crack my thumb-joint against\nmy head exactly resembles that which I perceived under the supple\nhandsofMadameBlavatsky. Theexplanationwhicha.ccountssatisfa.ctorily\nfor my own experience I do not pretend to offer as an assured explana.\ntion of the experiments made by Mr. Sinnett, though I do not by any\nmeans feel certain that it may not be sufficient. It is true that Mr.\nSinnett regards the hypothesis as \"idiotic\" (\"Occult World,\"p. 33) ; but\nthen he regarded the suggestion that the letter he described as\n\"materialised, or reintegrated in the air,\" was an outcome of any con-\ncealed apparatus, as \"grotesquely absurd\" (p. 120), notwithstanding\ntbe facts that tbe phenomenon occurred at the headquarters of the\nTbeosophical Society, tbat tbe ceiling of tbe room abounded with\ninterstices, and that the garret above might have heen crammed up to\nDigitized pyGoogle\n\fOil Phenomena connected fritll Theosophy_ 263\nthe tiled roof with all sorts of conjuring devices for aught he knew t()\nthe contrary. Mr. Sinnett treats with scorn the supposition that\nMadame Blavatsky could have produced either the II raps\" or the\nII astral bells\" by means of any machine concealed about her pe~on ;\nbut I cannot help thinking that the la.tter sounds at least might\nhaye been produced in this way. Madame Coulomb asserts that they\nwere actually so produced, by the use of a small musical-box,\nconstructed on the same principle as the machine employt'd in con-\nnection with the trick known under tbe name II Is your watch It\nrepeater?\" and she produced garments which she asserted had belonged\nto Madame Blavatsky, Itnd showed me stains resembling iron-mould on\nthe right side, slightly above the waist, wl1ich she affirmed had been\ncaused by contact with the metal of the machine. She declares als()\nthat the machine was sometimes carried by Babula, on the roof or\nin the various rooms of the house or outside, and when used by Madame\nBlavatsky herself was worked by a slight pressure of the arm agttinst the\nside, which would have been imperceptible to the persons present. I\nthink the II astral bells\" may be thus accounted for, and I must remind\nthe reader of an important consideration which Mr. Sinnett seems ro\nhave overlooked-namely, the great uncertainty in all localisation of\nsounds of which the cause and mode of production are unknown,especially\npure tones such as he describes the \"astral bell \" sound to be, and the\ngreat ease of inducing by trifling indications the adoption of an altogether\nerroneous opinion concerning the position where the sonorous disturbance\noriginates. Further, we may suppose, without any extravagance of\nhypothesis, that Madame Blavatsky may possess more than one of these\nmachines alluded to, so that the sounds may be heard in different\nplaces at the same time. Yet the possibility that if Madame Blavatsky\nhad one such machine she might haye had two does not seem to have\noccurred to Mr. Sinnett, if I may judge from his argument on p. 41.\nII Mltnaged a little better, the occurrence now to be dealt with\nwould haye been a beautiful test\" (\"Occult World,\" p. 43); for It certain\nclass or'readers it is told II not as a proof but as an incident,\" and it\nis worth a brief consideration from this point of view. Mrs. Sinnett\nII went one afternoon with Madame Blavatsky to the top of 0. neigh-\nbouring hill. They were only accompanied by one other friend.\" While\nthere Madame Blo.vatsky asked Mrs. Sinnett \"what was her heart's\ndesire.\" As Mr. Sinnett's correspondence with\" Koot Hoomi\" appears.\nto have begun about this time,* it is probable that much interest was\nexcited by the idea of receiving communications from the\" Adepts,\"\nand it cannot, therefore, be regarded as at all unlikely that Mrs. Sinnett\n\u2022 Whether he had received his first Koot Hoomi not~ is not manifest j h&\nhad certainly not received his second.\n\f26! J.1I,.. Hodg8on's Report\nshould ask as she did\" for a note from one of the Brothers.\" ~Ioreover,\nit does not appear that Madame Blavatsky guaranteed the fulfilment of\n.Mrs. Sinnett's \"heart's desire\" until she knew what the desire was,\nany more than she guaranteed the fulfilment of Mrs. Sinnett's wish\nthat the note should \"come fluttering down into her lap,\" and this\nlast wish was not granted. \"Some conversation ensued as to whether\nthis would be the best way to get it, and ultimately it was decided\nthat she should find it in a certain tree.\" Mr. Sinnett does not\nlay any stress upon the identity of the paper folded up by Madame\nHlavatsky with the paper of the pink note received by Mrs. Sinnett,\nnor will any person experienced in strawberry hunts, or familiar witb\nleafy trees, be in the least degree surprised that Mrs. Sinnett did not at\nonce perceive the\" little pink note\" upon the\" twig immediately before\niler face.\" The note was\" stuck on to the stalk of a leaf that had\nheen quite freshly torn off, for the stalk was still green and moist-not\nwithered as it would have been if the leaf had been tom off for any\nlength of time.\" \"Length of twe \" is vague.\nThe incident ought to be instructive. Colonel Olcott was the friend\nwho accompanied Mrs. Sinnett and l\\Iadame Blavatsky to the top of\nthe hill, where, according to his diary, they had seen on the previous\n<lay, \"through a field-glass, a man in white making signals\" to them.\nThe\" man in white\" may account for the expedition to the hill; he may\nalso account for the pin~ note in the tree. Weare unlikely to discover\nhow many of Madame Blavatsky's pre-arrangements were never carried\nout, owing to the complete failure of her anticipations; but the case\nbefore us clearly illustrates a partial failure. If Mrs. Sinnett had\nmade some other answer than the one she actually made to the question,\nput \"in a joking way\" by Madame Blavatsky, we should probably\nhave never heard of the conversation or the expedition at all. l!J-.\nSinnett has not told us definitely whether it was Madame Blavatsky\nor Colonel Olcott (whose name is not mentioned by Mr. Sumett at all\nin connection with the incident) who objected to MI\u00b7S. Sinnett's request\nthat the letter should\" come fluttering down into her lap,\" nor has he\ntold us what the exact objection was.* It is implied, however, that\n:Madame Blavatsky pointed out the tree supposed to be chosen by the\n41 Brother.\" Why did she first point out the wrong tree 1 Perhaps she\n:l.llticipated that Mrs. Sinnett might, for her own satisfaction, suggest\n* I have seen a newspaper account in which it was sai(l that Madame\nBlavatsky expressed the\" Adept's II opinion that if the note were to drop into\nMrs. Sinnett's lap, it might be urged afterwards that Madame Blavatsky had\nDlanaged the phenomenon by sleight of hand, and that therefore he (the Adept)\nproposed putting the note into a certain tree. This objection was not made in\ncases where the witnesses happened to be sitting under cre\\'iced beams or\nintersticed ceilings.\nDigitized by Goo\n\fOil PkenomellQ cOllnected witl, TI,eosophy. 265\nthe other tree; or perhaps there may have been a mistake between her-\nself and the \"man in white.\" The note said, \"I have been asked\nto leave a note here for you, what can I do for you 1\" The words are\nnot remarkably relevant; according to the account given by Mr. Sinnett,\nthe \" Brother\" had chosen the spot himself.\nWe \"come now to the incidents of a very remarkable day,\" (\"Occult\nWorld,\" pp. 44-59), that of the Simla picnic, October3rd,1880-the day\nof the cup and saucer, diploma, bottle of water, and Mrs. Hume's\nbrooch. The account given by Colonel Olcott, dated October 4th, 1880,\nand sent round at the time as a circular to the Fellows of the Theosophi-\ncal Society, throws a remarkable light upon Mr. Sinnett's narrative.\nThus, whereas from Mr. Sinnett's description of ~e events, it would\nseem that Madame Blavatsky had no share in the choice of the spot\nchosen for luncheon, almost the reverse of this appears from the\nopening sentences of Colonel Olcott's account :-\n..Grea.tday yesterday for Madame's phenomena. In the morning she,with\nMr. and Mrs. l:Iinnett, Major --, Mr. S. M., Mrs. R., and myself went on\na picnic. Although ahe had never been at Simla before, she directed us where\nto go, describing a certain small mill which the Sinnetts, Major -- and\neven the jalllpanis (palki-wallMa) affirmed, did not exist. She also\nmentioned a small Tibetan temple as being near it. We f'eached the .pot Bhe\nhad described and \/\u00abIund the miU at about 10 a.m. ; and sat in the shade and\nhad the servants sp~ a collation.\"\nI received from Colonel Olcott, not only a copy of the circular from\nwhich the above extract is taken, but a transcript from his diary-\naccount, and also further oral explanations. From these last it\nwould nppear that Madame Blavatsky and X. were in front of the\nothers, and that Madame Blavatsky described the road which they should\ntake; that it was Madame Blavatsky and X. who together chose pro.\nvisionally the spot for the picnic encampment; and that Mr. Sinnett\nand X. then walked on fllrther to see if a better spot could be chosen,\nand decided to remain at the place where the halt had already been\nmade.\nAs this place appears in Mr. Sinnett's account as a place they \"were\nnot likely to go to\" (p. 49) we cannot attach much weight to his opinion\nthat the cup and saucer were of a kind they\" were not likely to take.\"\nProbably Mada.me Blavatsky's native servant Babula, an active\nyoung fellow, who, I am assured 011 good authority, had formerly\nbeen in the service of a French conjurer, could throw even more light\nupon the day's proceedings than Colonel Olcott's account. The previous\nabstraction of the cup and saucer, their burial in the early morning, the\ndescription of the spot to Madame Blavatsky, the choice of the\nparticular service takcn, are deeds which lie easily within the accomplish-\nment of Babula's powers. Concerning a later period of the day, when\nT\nDigitized by Google\n\f266 MI'. llodgsol,'s Report\nthe party had shifted their quarters to another part of the wood, Mr.\nSinnett writes, on p. 51: \"X. Rnd one of the other gentlemen had\nwandered ow.\" From Colonel Olcott's accounts it appears that they had\ngone back to the previous' encampment in order t() ascertain if there\nwere any traces of a tunnel by which the cup and saucer might have\nbeen previously buried in an ordinary way, and that when they returned\nthey expressed their conviction that the cup and saucer might have\nbeen so buried, but that the ground about the spot had been so disturbed\nby the digging and throwing of earth, that evidence of such a tunnel\ncould not be found. Before the party returned from the picnic it. was\nknown that three of them, viz., Mrs. R., Mr. S. M., and Major - -\n(mentioned by Mr. Sinnett as X.), were dissatisfied with the\n\" phenomenon\"; the throe who came away believing, were Mr. and\nMrs. Sinnett and Colonel Olcott,-all of wliom seem to have previously\nfully attained the conviction of Madame Blavatsky's good faith. Shortly\nafterwards Major Henderson wrote a letter to the Ti'llUJ8 of India, in\nwhich he stated: \"On the day in question, 1 declared the saucer to be\nan incomplete and unsatisfactory manifestation, as not fulfilling proper\ntest conditions. My reasonable doubt was construed as a personal\ninsult, and I soon discovered that a sceptical frame of mind in the\ninquirer is not favourable to the manifestation of the marvels of\nTheosophy . . . . I am not a Theosophist nor a believer in the\nphenomena., which I entirely discredit, nor have .1 any intention of\nfurthering the objects of the Society in any way.\"\nThe concealment of the diploma and the management of the bottle\nof water would have been still easier tasks for Babula than the burying\nof the cup and saucer in the rooted bank. Against Mr. Sinnett's a.ccoflnt\nof the finding of the diploma by X., I have to set Colonel Olcott's state-\nment that the particular shrub where the diploma was found was\npointed out to X. by Madame Blavatsky, this statement being made in\nconnection with the passage in Colonel Olcott's diary: \"She points to\n1\\ bit of ground, and tells him to search there. He finds his diploma\n. . . under a low cedar-tree.\" In continuation Colonel Olcott\nwrites: \"Later, we are out of water, and she fills a bottle with pure\nwater by-putting the bottle up her sleeve.\" In connection with this\nincident Mr. Sinnett has much to suggest -about the abnormal\nstupidity of a certain coolie who had been sent with empty bottles to a\nbrewery with a pencil note asking for water, and who, finding no\nEuropean at the brewery to receive the note, had brought back the\n\" empty\" bottles. It was-apparently-one of these \"empty\" bottles\nthus brought hack that Madame Blavatsky took for her experiment.\nWho was this abnormally stupid coolie t Surely not Madame\nRlavatsky's personal servant Babula t It is difficult to suppose that\nMr. Sinnett would speak of (Babula as a coolie, and he could hardly\nDigitized by Google\n\f0\" Phel\/omella conllected with Theosol,hg. 267\nmake a greater mistake than to attribute abnormal stupidity to Babula\nrather than ~bnormal cleverness. And yet Babula was in some way\nconcerned. Colonel Olcott wrote, after saying that wanting some tea\nthey found they were out of water :-\n\" Servants were sent in various directions but could get none. While\nBabula was'oft'on a second search Madame quietly went to the lunch-baskots,\ntook an empty wat.er-bottle, put it in the loose sleeve of her gown, and came\nstraight to where we were sittillg on the grass. The bottle tOOIl full Qf ckarut\nand IlOftellt water, of which we all partook.\"\nGranted that Babula was present, the fact that all the bottles became\nempty, and that afterwards one of them became full, may be easily\naccounted for without the necessity of supposing that there was anything I\nmore substantial than a smile in Madame Blavatsky's sleeve. It is\ncurious how much Babula has been kept in the background of Mr.\nSinnett's account j carelessly, no doubt, and not carefully; but then, if\ncarelessly, Mr. Sinnett nlust be charged with a grievous lack of ordinary\nperspicacity.\nFinally, came the \"celebrated brooch incident.\" (\" Occult 'World,\"\npp. 54-59.) Of this it will suffice to say that the broocl, formed one of\nseveral articles of jewellery which Mrs. Hume had given to 0. person\nwho had again parted with them to another who had \"nllowec:l\nthem to pass out of their\u00b7 posse.ssion.\" It is an admitted fact\nthat many of these articles, parted with at the same time lIS the\nbrooch, did nctually pass through Colonel Olcott's bands very\nI\u00ab>On afterwards. Colonel Olcott does not remember seeing the brooch j\nbut that Madame Blavatsky may at that time have had an opportunity,\nwhich she seized, of obtaining possession of it, is obviouslyhighlyprobable,\nthough there is no absolute proof of this. It is at any rate certain that\nshe entrusted a brooch, which needed some slight repair, to Mr. Hormusji\nS. Seervai, of Bombay, who shortly afterwards returned it to Madame\nBlavatsky. When the \"brooch incident\" occurred later, and the\naccount of it was published containing a description of tbe brooch,\nMr. Hormusji found that the description exactly fitted the brooch which\nhlid been entrusted to him for repair by Madame Blavatsky. For these\nfacts I rely' chiefly on statements made to me personally by Mr.\nPlume and Mr. Hormusji, though, indeed, the first links of the chain had\nbeen previously published in various forms, and were ne,-er challenged,\nand I may add tha.t Mr. Hormusji's testimony is confirmed by that of\ntwo other witnesses who remember his immediate recognition of the\ndescription given in the account of the \" brooch incident\" as that of the\nbrooch Madame Blavatsky had given him to be repaired. The above\noutline is, I think, specific enough to lead the reader to a right conclu-\nsion. The fact that Mrs. Hume chose the lost brooch as the object to\nT 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f268 MI'. Hodgson's Report\nbe brought to her by the \"Brother,\" Mr. Hume is inclined to explain\nas a case of thought-transference to Mrs. Hume from MadalQe Blavatsky,\nwho was probably willing intensely that Mrs. Humeshould think ofthe\nbrooch. I do not dispute this opinion, though I cannot regard the\ncase as a proven instance of telepathy; Madame Blavatsky may hav!'\"\nhad enough knowledge of the history of the brooch and en~ugh prac-\ntical acquaintance with the laws of association, to make it l',88y for\nher to suggest that family relic to the thoughts of Mrs. Hume, without\nexciting the suspicion of the persons present, who, by Mr. Sinnett's\naccount, seem to have \"been as far as possible from attempting to\nrealise what a special chain of reminiscence may have been quickened\ninto vivid life by Madame Blavatsky's words.\nIt must not be forgotten, in dealing with these cases, that we do not\nknow how many \"phenomenal tests\" may have been arranged by\nMadame Blavatsky which did not succeed. She may have failed in\nleading to the needful topic of conversation; she may have been asked\nfor objects sho had not obtained, or could not obtain, and so refused on\none pretext or another to comply with some request made; I!he may\nhave offered an answer to a letter neither she nor any confederate was\nable to read, and failed in her Mahatma-reply to make any reference\nwhatever to the specific question asked in the undecipherable document;\nshe may have been requested to produce phenomena in a way dift'erent\nfrom that already prepared; she may not have provided for contingen-\ncies such as the absence of the persons required for the experiment, and\nso on. There are samples of these several kinds of failures, which would,\nI presume, be regarded by Mr. Sinnett merely as interesting \"incidents.\"\nA notable incident of this kind may be given as it is closely related to the\nnext group of \"proofs\" to which we pass in Mr. Sinnett's \"Occult\nWorld.\" Itappears that Madame Blavatsky, for the benefit of Oaptain\nMaitland, had professed to send a cigarette tied up with her hair to a\nplace under the hom of the unicorn on the coat of arms under the statue\nof the Prince of Wales, opposite Watson's Hotel in Bombay. Captain\nMaitland telegraphed (from Simla) to Mr. Grant in Bombay, asking him\nto look immediately for the cigarette. Mr. Grant found no cigarette in\nthe place described. MadameCoulomb asserts that she was the person who\nwas to ha.ve put the cigarette there, but that she \"never went near the\nplace.\" (\"Some Account,\"&c.,by Madame Coulomb,pp.16-18.) Hence the\nfailure,not mentioned byMr. Sinnett. TheBlavatsky-Coulomb documents\nsufficiently discredit the cigarette phenomena., and it can be seen at once\nthat those quoted by Mr. Sinnett might have been arranged with\nperfect ease by Madame Blavatsky. In the first case, that of Mrs.\nGordon, the .. place indicated\" as the place where the cigarettft would\nbe found is not stated. In the two other instances given, the\ncigarettes were f?und in places where they would probably remain un-\nDigitized by Google\n\f0\/1 Phellomena cOllnected with Theo8oph!l. 269\ndiscovered for some tinle, unless particular search for them were made,\nand Madame Blavatsky-or, by her instructions, Babula-might have\ndeposited them there pre\"iously. Mr. Sinnett says that \"for }>fIrsollS who\nhave not actually seen Madame Blavatsky do one of her cigarette feats it\nlDay be useless to point out that she does not do them as a conjurer\nwould,\" and cp.rtainly it is difficult for such persons t~ understand\nthe profound conviction which }Ir. Sinnett displays (\" Occult 'Vorld,\"\np. 63) concerning the identity of the comer of the paper torn off with\nthe comer given to the percipient, in the face of such sleight-of-hand\nperformances as he himself describes :-\n\"You take two pieces of paper, and tear oft' a comer of both together, so\nthat the jags of both are the same. You make a cigarette with one piece,\nand put it in the place where you mean to have it ultimately found. You\nthen hold the other piece underneath the one you tear in presence of the\nspectator, slip in one of the already torn comers into his hand instead of\nthat he sees you tear, make your cigarette with the other part of tho original\npiece, dispose of that anyhow you please, and allow the prepared cigarette to\nbe found. Other variations of the system may be readily imagined.\"\nMr. Sinnett's naive remark that the certainty of the spectator would\nlie enhanced by the pencil-marks drawn upon the cigarette paper before\nhis eyes, compels me to suppose that his experience in conjuring must be\nvery limited. For it appears that the pencil-marks were chosen and\ndrawn by Madame Blavatsky herself; she declined to let Captain Mait-\nland \"mark or tear the papers\"; otherwise there might have been no\napparent similarity between the paper marked and that which had\nalready been deftly rolled by Madame Blavatsky's fingers, and was\nlying snugly on a shelf inside the piano, or in the covered cup on the\nbracket.\nMr. Sinnett's confidence that the cigarette feats are not conjuring\nperformances will appear still more singular to persons who have\npractised palming, as I have myself done, and who read the following\nsentences from the accounts given on p. 62 :-\n\"The cigarettes being finished,Madame Blavatekystood up,and took them\nbetween her hands, which sho rubbed together. After about 20 or\n30 seconds, tho grating noise of the pa.per, a.t first distinctly audible,\nceased.\"\n\"With the remainder of the papershe prepared a cigarette ill the ordinary\nmanner, and in a few momenta caused this cigarette to disappear from her\nhanda.\"\nIn short, if Madame Blavatsky does not do ber cigarette feats as a\nconjurer would, the descriptions quoted by llr. Sinnett, pp. 60-63, must\n.be fundamentally erroneous.\nThe next case for our consideration is the Pillow Incident. (\" Occult\nDigitized by Google\n\f270 Mr. Hoag8oll'.s Report\n\"World,\" pp. 75-79..) Mr. Sinnett's\" subjective impressions\" of the\nprevious night appear to be in close relation with the incident, if not\nto form part of it; but as thEly are not exactly described, I am unable,\nof course, to deal with them. If they were neither hallucination nor\nextreme illusion suffered by Mr. Sinnett, they may have been due to\n~Iadame Blavatsky's boldness and cleverness, in which case the cushion\nmay have been manipulated before Mr. Sinnett spoke of his impres-\nsions that morning. And here again appears the invaluable Bahula,\nwho was probably the\" Brother\" who inserted the brooch and the note\nprovided by Madame Blavatsky, in the jampan cushion. Was it\na remarkable fact that this particular cushion was chosen 1\nThere may, indeed, have been a second object, and a note in\nsome adjoining tree in case a tree had beeu chosen, and there\nmay have been a third buried in the ground; though I think\nit unlikely that Madame Blavatsky would have taken any\ntrouble to provide for these contingencit)s, even if there were other\nobjects which might have \"hinged on\" to Mr. Sinnett's subjective\nimpressions. Simply because such places as the ground and the tree\nhad been chosen before, they were not likely to be chosen again; it\nwas not so exceedingly improbable that the finnly..made \" usual jampan\ncushion\" which Mrs. Sinnett might certainly be expected to take with\nher should be selected.. Madame Blavatsky's intimate acquaintance\nwith Mr. Sinnett may haye enabled her .to anticipate with considerable\nconfidence that he would choose the cushion. Besides, if it should\nunfortunately not be chosen, some cOIl\\'ersation might ensue as to\nwhethel' the place fixed upon was the best, and ultimately it might he\ndecided that they should look for it ill olle of the cushions. If any\nmistake were made about the cushion, Madame Blavatsky might again\nget into communication with Koot Hoomi, and a..-,;certain that it was in\nMrs. Sinnett's cushion that the object was being placed, as in the case\nof the \" incident\" discussed above, p. 264.\nBut ~h. Sinnett gaye a note to Madame Blamtsky, apparently just\nbefore starting out, for Koot Hoomi. This note is said to have dis-\nappeared when they were about half way to their destination, yet no\nreference to this was made in the Koot Hoomi note found in the\ncushion. Let us suppose, allowing the picnic-spot t~ be only half an\nhour's:distance, that this in\\'olved only a quarter of an hOUl\"S intenal\nbetweell the disappearance of the note and the choice of the cushion,\nfollowed by the preparation of the\" currents.\" 'Vhat happened during\nthis qual-ter of an hour 1 .'Ve read in other places of in8tantaneous\ntransportations of solid objects, instantaneous precipitations of answer\"\nto questions, &c. I suppose this quarter of an hour would be accounted\nfor by the blundering of a Chela, the Chela being Madame Blavatsky.\nIt will hardly be pleaded that\" tJle currents fOl' the production of the\nDigitized by Goo\n\fOn Phellomena connectedlrit\/~ TheolJophy. 271\npillow dak\" had been set ready some time before the pillow had been\nchosen, unless it is intended to take refuge in the surrejoinder that Koot\nHoomi knew that Mr. Sinnett would be certain to choose the pillow,\nand could, therefore, pre-arrange the \"currents,\" but that Koot Hoomi\ndid not know, when he thus pre-arranged the currents, what Mr.\nSinnett had written, 01' even that Mr. Sinnett had written a letter at\nall. All this ignorance on the part of Koot Hoomi, notwithstandipg\nthe fact that MI'. Sinnett's letter was in answer to a. Koot Hoomi note,\nand tha.t Koot Hoomi was supposed to be busy with phenomena for\nMr. Silmett's behoof! Mr. Sinnett's faith, however, does not seem to\nhave been affecteci by this little hiatus of time, though it seems to have\nbeen stimulated by the underlining of a \"k\" in the Koot Hoomi\ncushion note, as on the previous evening\" Madame Blavatsky had been\nsaying that Koot Hoomi's spelling of 'Skepticism' with a 'k' was\nnot an Americanism in his case, but due to a philological whim of his.\"\n(This \"philological whim\" is not always remembered; I have myself\nseen \" sceptic\" spelt with a \" c\" in a Koot Hoomi document.) That\nthe note found in the cushion bore reference throughout to the con-\n,'ersation (we will suppose, not led up to) of the previous evening, but\ncontained not the slightest allusion to Mr. Sinnett's note of the follow-\ning morning, leads me to the inference that the said Koot Hoomi note\nwas inserted in the cushion in the interval-and, as I have stated,\nby Babula.\nThe Jhelum telegram case might be explained in a variety of ways,\nbut Mr. Sinnett has not given us the detail necessary to enable us to\nfonn any conclusion. The incident was briefly as follows. (\" Occult\nWorld,\" pp. 80-83). Mr. Sinnett, before leaving Simla for Allahabad,\nwrote a letter to Koot Hoomi which he sent to Madame Blavatsky,\nwho was at Amritsur. This letter was written on October 24th,\n1880. The envelope of this letter was returned to Mr. Sinnett by\nMadame Blavatsky, and bore, as I understand, the afternoon postmark\nof October 27th. On October 27th, Mr. Sinnett, then at Allahabad,\nl'eceived a teiegl'am from Jhelum sent on October 27th, This telegram\ncontained a specific reply to his letter, Afterwards Mr. Sinnett was\nrequested, through :Madame Blavatsky, to see the original* of the Jhelum\n\u2022 I may here mention a curious document which was unintentionally lent to\nme for several days by Mr. Damodar. I had with 80me difficulty obtained\nse\\'eral 8pecimens of Mahatma writing, and in au envelope enclosinll: some of\nthese I afterwards found a 8lip of paper, which had not-as I concluded when\nlater I discovered that it WaH not enumerated among those lent to me-\nbeen observed in the envelope when Mr. Damodar gave me permission to\ntake the specimens away. This document was a single amall fragment of\nthin paper, undated and unsigned. On one side of it were written the following\nwords in red ink, and the writing resembles that attributed to l\\lahatma M. :\n0\"\n\f272 MI'. Hodg801J'8 Report\ntelegram. This he succeeded in doing, and found the writing to be that\nof Koot Hoomi.\nLet us suppose that Madame Blavatsky did not forge the \"evidential\"\npustmark; that post-office peons were none of them bribed to mark* or\ndeliver a letter otherwise than in due course; that the letter enclosed by\nMr.Sinnett in the envelope was actually despatched in that envelope; that\nprevious to its despatch the contents were known to no one but Mr.\nSinnett, and that no one acquired any knowledge of the contents before\nthe letter reached Madame Blavatsky's hands. Under these circum-\nstances it would still have been possible for Madame Blavatsky to have\nread the letter, and to have telegraphed the right reply to a confederate\nin Jhelum, who might then have penned or pencilled the telegram to Mr.\nSinnett in sufficiently close imitation of the Koot Hoomi handwriting\nordinarily produced by Madame Blavatsky, to have deceived Mr. Sinnett.\nI have made all the above suppositions for the purpose of drawing the\nreader's notice to the fact that, presuming that theJhelum telegram docu-\nment, afterwards inspected by Mr. Sinnett, was actually the document\nhanded in as the message to be despatched to him, we should require\nsome further evidence of the identity of its handwriting with that of Mr.\nSinnett's Koot Hoomi documents generally, than that furnished by the\nexamination of Mr. Sinnett himself, who appears not to have observed\nthe numerous traces of Madame Blavatsky's handiwork in the earliest\nKoot Hoomi letters he received.\nI think it probable, however, that the document in question was,\nas a matter of fact, written by Madame Blavatsky herself, and that Mr.\nSinnett's letter reached her, either in the envelope in which he enclosed\nit, or in Rnot\/IM, before the 27th. It surprised me considerably to find\nthat Amritsur was only 21 hourst from Simla, and Jhelum only 8 hours\nfrom Amritsur. Madame Blavatsky is said to have received Mr.\nSinnett's envelope not earlier than the afternoon of October 27th,so that,\nif the Amritsur postmark was bond foU, it probably left Simla. on\nOctober 26th. Mr. Sinnett's letter was written on October 24th. This\nla.rge hiatus of time is not alluded to in Mr. Sinnett's account, which\nis remarkable for the scantiness of its detail concerning the most impor-\n..

He does not\nmention the Simla post--mark, nor does Ae make any suggestion, for the\nbenefit of the English reader, as to the distances between Simla,\nAmritsur, and Jhelum. Yet Mr. Sinnett seems to have regarded this\nfragmentary evidence as likely to appeal to other mind!! besides his own\n(\"Occult 'Vorld,\" p. 80); no doubt it may do so if they take for\ngranted that the details neglected contribute to the malTellousness of\nthe phenomenon. .\nWith reference to the portraits drawn in Mr. Sinnett's house(\"Occult\nWorld,\" pp. 137-139), it is not necessary to say any more, considering\nthe exiguity of Mr. Sinnett's account, than that Madame Blayatsky is\nexceedingly skilful in the use of both pencil and brush. I have seen\nspecimens of her handiwork, not only in certain playing-cards, which\nColonel Olcott showed m~ach card being a clever, humorous sketch,\n-but in drawings, precisely similar to that mentioned by Mr. Sinnett,\nwhere the face on the white paper was defined by contrast with \"cloudy\nblue shading.\"*\nOn the whole, then, I think I am justified in saying that the\nphenomena. relied upon by Mr. Sinnett in \"The Occult 'Vorld\" can be\naccounted for much more satisfactorily than can the performances of\nany ordinary professional conjurer by the uninitiated obsen'er, howevel'\nacute; that the additional details which I have been enabled to furnish\nin connection with some of the incidents Mr. Sinnett has recorded,\nclearly show that he has not been in the habit of exercisingdue caution\nfor the exclusion of trickery; and that he has not proceeded in accordance\nwith those \"scientific modes of investigation\" which he explicitly\ndeclares (\"Occult World,\" p. 35) he regarded as necessary for the task\nhe attempted.\nEVIDENCE OF ME. A. O. HUME\n(Late Government Secretary of India).\nAs Mr. Hume took a prominent part in the early deyelopment of\nthe Theosophical Society in India, and even published two pamphlets\non the subject, \"Hints on Esoteric Theosophy,\" Nos. 1 and 2, it\nseems to me desirable to draw special attention to the considerable\nchange which has taken place in his opinion concerning the phenomena.\n\u2022 Blue pencil is a favoured instrument at the Theosophical headquarters.\nI poBII8888d a specially convenient form of a patent blue pencil, and having\nhanded this to Mr. Babajee for the purpose of enabling him to write a name\nand address which he wished to give me, he remarked, 11.8 he regarded it with\n8pontaneous admiration, ..

Hodgsoll's Report\nconnected with Ma.da.me Blavatsky. I enjoyed, while in India, the\nopportunity of having various long interviews with Mr. Hume, aud\nha.ve already referred to his conclusion (reached after a most careful\ninquiry) in connection with the incident of the recovery of Mrs. Hume's\nbrooch, that Madame Blavatsky may very well have obtained the brooch\npreviously by ordinary methods. Long before the publication of the\nBlavatsky-Coulomb letters in the Cl,ristian College Magazine, Mr.\nHume had discovered that some of Madame Blavatsky's phenomena\nwere fraudulent, and that some of the professed Mahatma writing was\nthe handiwork of Madame Blavatsky herself. Once or twice he had\nseen notes on some philosophic question which had been made by Mr.\nSubba Row (Va.kil of the High Court, Madras), 110 leading native\nTheosophist. The substance of these notes appeared afterwards worked\nup into a Mahatma document (received by either himself or ?tIl'.\nSinnett), and worsened in the working. I inquired of Mr. Subbl'\nRow, the ablest native Theosophist I have met, whether he was\na.ware of the episodes which Mr. Humc had described. He replied\nlaconically, \"It may be so.\" When the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters\nwere first published Mr. Hume expressed his opinion publicly tlJat\nMadame Blavatsky was too clever to have thus committed herself;\nlatterly, however, and partly in consequence of the evidence\nI was able to lay before him, he came to the conviction that\nthe letters in question were actually written by Madame Blavatsky.\nFurther, he had never placed the slightest credence in the Shrine-\nphenomena., which he had always supposed to be fraudulent. I may\nstate also that his conclusions, reached independently of my own and\nfrom different circumstances, concerning the untrustworthiness of\nMessrs. Damodar, Baba.jee, and Babula., entirely corroborated those\nto which I had been forced. Yet Mr. Hume was originally just as fully\ncommitted to the genuineness of certain phenomena as Mr. Sinnett him-\nself, as will be manifest from a perusal of his \"Hints on Esoteric\nTheosophy,\" from which some of the narratives quoted in our First\nReport were taken. His present attitude is an admirable testimony not\nonly to his readiness to accept the truth at the cost of negating so\nextensively his own past opinions, but also to the systematic pains be\nhas taken in sifting the antecedents of the apparently marvellous\nphenomena which occurred in close connection with himself. For\nexample, he received a Koot Hoomi communication in a letter coming\nfrom a person who had no connection with Theosophy. This may\nhave been the incident referred to by Mr. Sinnett (\" Occult World;'\np. 21), as follows:-\n\" When this Society [the Simla branch of the Theosophical Society] WIlS\nformed, many lette1'8 passed between Koot Hoomi and oU1'8elves, which were\ntlot in every cue transmitted through MacilUlle Blav8tsky. In one case, for\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Phenomena coHnectecl uitl, Theosoph!l. 276\n(,Dmple, 1\\11'. Hume, who became President for the first year CJf the new\nSociety . \u2022 \u2022 got a note from Koot Hoomi inside a letter receivell\nthrough the post from a person wholly unconnected with our occult pUI'\u00b7\nsuits, W]lO was writing to him in connection with BOrne municipal business.\"\n, '\nMr. Hume has informed me that he himself received the letter,\nwhich was large and peculiar in appearance, from the postman's hands.\nA long time afterwards, when reinvestigating a number of supposed\nphenomena (not published) which had occurred at- his house, he learnt\nincidentally from one of his servants that just such a. letter had been\ntaken by Babula from the postman early one morning, and carried oft~\nto Madame, and had been returned to the postman, when the postman\ncame by again, Babula, who said that it was not for Madame but for\n'Mr. Hume. The servant had wondered at the time why Babula had\nnot taken the letter to Mr. Hume himself, and he said that htt\nthought he remembered that Babula. had taken and returned\nletters in the same way on other occasions. We suggested a somewhat\nsimilar procedure on the part of Babula. in our First Report as an\nexplanation of instances analogous to that of Mr. Hume's. In varioUl>\ncases, which it is unnecessary to reproduce in this Report, it will be\nseen that Madame Blavatsky may have been enabled in a similar way\nto tamper with the letters before they actua.lIy reached the addressees.\nIt may be instructive here to quote Mr. Hume's testimony to the fact\nthat peculiar envelopes and paper, like those generally used by Madame\nBlava.tsky for the Mahatma communications, are procurable in the\nneighbourhood of DaIjeeling, that they were not used for the earliest\nMahatma documents, which appeared before Madame Blavatsky had\nvisited Darjeeling, but were first brought into requisition for that\npurpose at l\\ time which coincided with her visit to tha.t place. Mr.\nHume's position at present is that\" despite all the frauds perpetrated.\nthere have been genuine phenomena, and that, though of a low order.\nMadame [Blavatsky] really had and has Occultists of considerable\nthough limited powers behind her; that K.. H. is a real entity, but by\nno means the powerful a.nd godlike being he has been painted, and that\nhe has had some share, directly or indirectly-though what Mr. Hume\ndoes not pretend to say.-in the production of the K. H. letters.\" The-\nreader already knows that I cannot myself discover sufficient evidence\nfor the occurrence of any II occult phenomenon\" whatever in connection\nwith the Theosophical Society.\nI have thus far postponed the consideration of the handwriting\npurporting to have been \"precipitated.\" The specimens of such writing\nwhich canle under my notice in India were of three kinds, and were\nalleged to have emanated from :Mahatma Koot Hoomi, Mahatma M.,\nand the C\/lela, \"Bhola. Deva. Sarma,\" respectively. I made a minute\nDigitized by Google\n\f276 Mt'. Hodg8on'8 Report\nand prolonged examination of these and other manuscripts with a view\nto determining by whose hand the supposed \"precipitated\" communica-\ntiona were written. The conclusions I reached were such as fully to\n<confirm the results of my investigations in other directions, and they\nare generally and briefly as follow :-\nThat the one specimen of the Chela B. D. S. writing which I had\nthe opportunity of carefully examining was the handiwork of lIr.\nBabajee D. Nath: that the several specimens of Mahatma M. (M. C.)\nwriting which I had the opportunity of carefully examining were the\nhandiwork of Madame Blavatsky: and that of the several specimens of\nMahatma Koot Hoomi (K. H.) writing which I had the opportunity of\n<carefully examining, one was the handiwork of Mr. Damodar K.\nMava.la.nkar, the others were the handiwork of Madame Blavatsky.\nSince my return to England I have been strengthened in this last\n~onclusion by an examination of 0. large quantity of K. H. lISS.\nforwarded to nle by Mr. Hume,* a series of K. H. documents entrusted\nto us by Mr. Sinnett, and a K. H. document sent to us by Mr. Padshah\nfor comparison with other K. H. writings. The K. H. conlmunica-\ntion belonging to Mr. Padshab is, in my opinion, the handiwork of\nMr. Damodar, and the K. H. documents sent by Mr. Hume and lIr.\nSinnett the handiwork of Madame Blavatsky. !tis probable, therefore,\nthat various K. H. communications received in India. during Madante\nBlavatsky's absence in 1884 were written by Mr. Damodar. Many of\nthese were produced under circumstances which absolutely precluded\nthe possibility that Madame Blavatsky could have' written them,\nbut nnder which it would have been easy for Mr. Damodar to have\nwritten them. My justification for the conclusions I have expressed\nabove concerning the authorship of the handwriting will be found in\nPart II. of this Report, to which I now proceed.\nPART II.\nThe chief questions in which we are aided by caligraphic evidence\nconcern the authorship of the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters and the\nauthorship of the Mahatma documents. I do not propose to go into\nany detail in describing the similarities between Madame Blavatsky's\nundoubted handwriting and the handwriting of the Blavatsky-Coulomb\n\u2022 I have now in my hands numerous documents which are concerned with\nthe experiences of Mr. Hume and others in connection with Madame Blayatsky\nand the Theosophical Society. These documents, including the K. H. )lSR.\naboye referred to, did not reach me till August, Rnli my examination of them,\nparticularly of the K. H. lISS., hL'! inyol\\\"ed a cODsiderable delay in the produc-\ntion of this Report.\nDigitized by Google\n\f011 Pilenomenll connected ,fitlt TheoBO))li!l. 271\nletters.* These letters, before publication in the Cll1vtian College\nMagazine, were, as I havo laid, submitted by the editor to several\ngentlemen with experience in handwriting, who were unequivocally\nof opinion that they were written by Madame Blavatsky. The same\nopinion was also expressed by Mr. J. D. B. Gribble, of Madras, ill\n\"A Report of an Examination into the Blavatsky Correspondence,\npublished in the Christian College MagazinlJ.\" But the most im-\npolunt judgment on this point is that of the expert in handwriting.\nMr. F. G. Netherclift, who has no doubt whatever that the disputed\nletters which were submitted to him were written by Madame\nBlavatsky. His Report will be found on p. 381. Mr. Sims, of the\nBritish Museum, is also of the same opinion.\nUnder these circumstances I need say little more than that I\nexamined the whole of these documents, and throughout I found thoSE!'\ncharacteristics of Madame Blavatsky's handwriting which were\npresent in the document I used as my chief standard, viz., a lette.'\nfrom Madame Blavatsky to Dr. Hartmann, written from Elberfeld ill\nOctober, 1884.\nI had other undoubted writings t of Madame Blavatsky in my\npossession, which rendered me some assistance, but, as will appea.\"\npresently, I was unable to regard these as altogether trustworthy.\nFurther, I found no peouliarity whatever in the Blavatsky-Coulomb\nletters which is not present in Madame Blavatsky's undoubted hand-\n\u00b7writing. There were, indeed, a few forms which are not found very\noften in Madame Blavatsky's ordinary handwriting, and which are\nfound often in the Koot Hoomi writings j but this statement applies\njust as much to Madame Blavatsky's acknowledged handwriting as it\ndoes to the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters, and it appears to me to suggest\nan additional proof of the fact that the letters in question were one\nand all written by Madame Blavatsky.\nIn Part I. of this Report I have shown that the circumstantial e,-i-\ndence which I obtained in relation to these disputed letters, adds to the-\nstrength of the conclusion reached on grounds of handwriting, that\n:Madame Blavatsky wrote them. I shall show later that there is eYi-\ndence which confirms yet further the justice of this conclusion. In\n\u2022 Several of tbese letters were lent to me for my own examination by the\neditor of the Chrjatiall College MaglUine. The remaining letters I examined\nat the house of a gentleman in whose custody they were at the time. Some of\nthem which I selected myself were entrusted to me to he sent to England for\nthe judgment of the best experts obtainable, with the special request that they\nshould be returned &8 BOOn &8 possible. and I found upon my arrival in England\nthat they had already been returned.\nt I refer to the B.

Hodg.on'd Report\norder to appreciate the considerations which follow, we must first\nunderstand the circumstances under which several of the documents\ndemanding our attention appeared. I must therefore bl'iefty describe\nthe course of events at the headquarters of the Theosophical Society\nafter the departure of Madame Bla\\'atsky and Colonel Olcott for\nEurope in February, 1884.\nBefore this time, according to Dr. Hartmann, if Madame Coulomb\n., found a willing ear she would never hesitate a moment to insinuate\n-that the whole Society was a humbug, the phenomena pl'Oduced by\nfraud, and that' she could tell many things, if she only wanted to do\nso.''' After the departure of Afadarue Blavatsky she appal\u00b7tmtly began\n-to speak more freely to that effect, IMld it appeared, moreover, to the\nofficers of the Society, especially Mr. St. George Lane-Fox and Dr.\nHartmann, that the Coulombs were wasting its funds. Letters on the\nsubject were written from the headquarters to Madame Bla\\'atsky and\nColonel Olcott. In particular, MI'. Damodar wrote to l\\Iadame Blavatsky,\nprobably by the mail leaving India. 011 March 12th, which would\narrive in Paris about April 1st, informing her that l\\Iadame Coulomb\nwas spreading reports that the phenomena were fraudulent. In\nthe meantime Mr. Lane-Fox and Dr. Hartmann resoh'ed\" to impeach\nthem L\nthe Coulombs] in a formal manner,\" and began to draw up the\ncharges. At this stage Mr. Damodar produced a Koot Hoomi letter\nwhich he declared that he had receh'ed from the \"nstrnl form of a.\nChela,\" and which runs as follows :-\n\" So long as one has not developed a perfect sense of justice, he should\n}Jrefer to err rather on the side of mercy than commit the slightest act of\ninjustice. Madame Coulomb is a medium and as such irresponsible for many\nthings she may say or do. At the same time she is kind and charitable.\nOne must know how to act towards her to make her a very good friend.\nShe has her own weaknesses, but their bad effects can be minimised by\nexercising on her mind a moral influence by a friendly and kindly feeling.\nHer mediumistic nature is a help in this direction, if proper a<l\\'antage be\ntaken of the same.\n\u2022\u2022 It is my wish therefore that she shall continue in charge of tJle household\nbusiness, ilie Board of Control of COU1'8e exercising a prolICI' supervisory\ncontrol, and seeing, in consultation with her, that no unnecessary expendi-\nture is incurred.

Lane-Fox, and Mr. Damodar went \"for a change\" to Oota.ca.-\nmund. By this time the letters complaining of the Coulombs had\nreached Madame Blavatsky, who wr'?te to the Coulombs a letter which\nwith its threats and its pleadings* speaks for itself to the intelligent\nreader. Madame Blavatsky no doubt wrote also to Mr. Damodar.\nHer letters would reach Madras about April 24th, and Ootacamund\non April 26th, on which date Mr. Damodar produced a Mahatma M.\nletter, declaring that it had fallen in his room; it was addressed to\nDr. Hartmann, who has published the following portions of it::-\n..

The writer\nof the letter was evidently unaware that Mr. Lane-Fox was with\n:lIr. Damodar at Ootacamund, and that Dr. Hartmann was at Madras.\nlIr. Damodar, however, remedied the ignorance of \"Mahatma M.\",\nand showed the letter to Mr. Lane-Fox before forwarding it to Dr.\nHartmann.\nAs a consequence of these and other documents and the resulting\naltercations, immediate action was taken by Mr. Lane-Fox and Dr.\nHartmann,which led to the expulsion of Madame Coulomb on Ma.y 14th,\non the ground tha.t she had spoken evil of the Society. According\nto Dr. Hartmann, \"M. Coulomb was requested to resign, but as he\n\u2022 See Madame Conlomb'lI pamphlet\" Some Account,\" &0., pp.9-1-104.\nDigitized by Google\n\f280 NI'.

Coulomb gave up the keys of Madame Blavatsky's\nrooms on May 17th or 18th. Madame Coulomb showed me a telegram\nsent to her by lIadame Blavatsky on May 19th: \"What can be done 1\nTelegraph\"; and asserted that this telegram was in l\"eply to a lettet\u00b7\nwritten by her to Madame Blavatsky at the end of April (which would\nreach Paris about May 19th), threatening, in case of a rupture, to\nproduce incriminating letters written by the latter. M. Coulomb\ndeclal\"es that he showed tIlls telegram to Mr. Damodar, who refused to\ntake any notice of it, and therefore no reply was sent by the Coulombs\nto Madame Blavatsky.\nSome time later Colonel Olcott received, he says, in a \"cover post\nmarked Madras,\" a letter forged in the handwriting of Dr. Hartmann.\n\"Writing to Dr. Hartmann on July 10th, Colonel Olcott stated that he\nhad received this document \"some little time ago,\" and had laid it away\nin his despatch-box, but that in going through his papers that morning\n(July 10th), \"I noticed that the Master had been putting his hand upon\nthe document and while reading his endorsement I heard him tell me\nto send it to you by to-day's post.\"\nThe endorsement-by \"Mahatma M.\"-is in these words: \"A\nclumsy forgery, but good enough to show how much an enterprising\nenemy can do in this direction.

The evidence for this will appear\nlater. I must now describe the manner in which various documents\nused by me in my examination of handwriting in India came into my\npossession.\nSoon after my arrival at Adyar, I asked for a specimen of }Iadame\nBlavatsky's undoubted handwriting,-for the purpose of comparison\nwith the disputed documents. Mr. Damodar avoided giving me any\nbefore Madame Blavatskyand Colonel Olcott reached headquarters,\nand after I had had some conversation with them on the subject, Colonel\nOlcott said that Madame Blavatsky would write me a letter at once, if\nI wished, which I could use as a test document. I replied that it would\nbe desirable for me to have some manuscript that was written before\nthe appearance of the ChriB'ian College Magazine in September, where-\nupon Colonel Olcott said abruptly that he could take no action as to\ngiving me any handwriting of Madame Blavatsky's until their own\nCommittee had met and that Madame Blavatsky was in the hands of\nthe Theosophical Society.\nMy request, made at the same time, for Mahatma documents for the\npurpose of submitting them to a caligraphic expert was also refused.\nI was afterwards, however, enabled to obtain some documents in the\nfollowing manner. Mr. Damodar had recounted to me some of his\nprofessed experiences, and had shown me several Mahatma documents in\nconnection with them. Most of these, he alleged, were too plivate to be\nsubmitted for my reading throughout, but there were several to which\nthis objection did not apply, and aDlong these were some 161 pages\nof the K. H. writing in black ink, which had formed portions of\nthe reply by K. H. to questions which had been raised concerning\ncertain statements in \"Esoteric Buddhism.\" I pointed out to Mr.\nDamodar that there could be no possible objection to my having these\nfor examination, and he agreed, and allowed me to take them away for\na few days for my own inspection only. The 16jpp. referred to I shall\n.speak of as the K. H. 16ipp.\nI received also from Dr. Hartmann, for my own inspection only,\nthe letter from Madame Blavatsky, written to him from Elberfeld in\nOctober, 1884, the forged Hartmann document, and the K.H. (Y)\nletter already mentioned.\nFurther, I had been anxious to know what answer Madame\nBlavatsky bad to make to the pamphlet written by Madame\nCoulomb, entitled \"Some Account,\" \u00abc., and Madame Blavatsky\nbad taken the trouble to write out her replies to the first portion\nof this pamphlet, although I had not asked her for a written\nU\nDigitized by Google\n.-\n\f282 Mr. Hodgson's Report\nstatement, and although she made oral statements as well, the\nimportant points of which I took down at the time in writing. This\nwritten statement by Madame Blavatsky covers about Tipp. foolscap.\nI shall speak of it as the B. Replies. In addition, Madame Blavatsky\nwrote various statements in my copy of Madame Coulomb's pamphlet.\nThese I shall speak of as the B. Marginal.Notes. Other documents\ncame under my notice, which it will suffice to specify further on\nwhen I have occasion to refer to them.\nI now proceed to consider the authorship of the Mahatma.\nletters, and propose in the first place, and chiefly, to deal with the\nK. H. series of documents, these being by far the most abundant and\nthe most important of the Mahatma writings. It is upon the K. H.\nseries almost exclusively that Mr. Sinnett has relied for his volume on\n\"Esoteric BuddhillIn\" as well as for certain portions of \"The Occult\nWorld\" ; it is to the K. H. series that most of the Mahatma letters\nwritten to other persons also belong; and it is portions of the K. H.\nseries alone which we have been able to obtain for the purposes of\ncareful examination.\nWith the incriminating Blavatsky-Coulomb letters wlJich were\nsubmitted to Mr. Netherclift, were also submitted some specimens of\nthe K. H. writing, viz., several small slips which were forwarded\nfrom India. with the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters proper, a K. H.\ndocument in blue ink submitted by Mr. Massey, and a K. H.\ndocument in blue pencil submitted by Mr. Myers. Mr. Netherclift, in\nthe first instance, came to the conclusion that these K. H. documents\nwere not written by Madame Blavatsky. I had already expressed\nmy- own conclusion, reached after an investigation of K. H.\nwritings in India, that those I had examined were, with the\nexception of the K. H. (Y), written by Madame Blavatsky, and\non my arrival in England I was surprised to find that Mr. Netherclift\nwas of a different opinion concerning the K. H. writings submitted\nto him. The small slips I had already seen in India; and after\nexamining the K. H. writings submitted by Messrs. Massey and Myers,\nI concluded that these also were written by Madame Blavatsky. My\njudgment, however, was originally formed upon my examination of\nthe K. H. 16ipp., in which the marks of Madame Blavatsky's handi-\nwork were more patent than in the documents which Mr. Netherclift\nhad had an opportunity of examining. In the meantime we had\nobtained from Mr. Sinnett eight specimens of the K. H. writing, which\nrepresented, some of them at least, consecutive periods of time, beginning\nwith the earliest letter received by Mr. Sinnett. In this, which was\nreceived about October, 1880, the traces of Madame Blavatsky's\nhandiwork were numerous and conspicuous, and from th~ onwards\nthe gradual development of the K. H. conventional characteristics,\nDigitized by Google\n\f0\" PMnomena connected tcitll Theo8oph!\/. 283\nand the gradual elimination of many of Madame Blavatsky's pecu-\nliarities, were clearly manifest. The K. H. writings which had\nbeen submitted to Mr. Netherclift, were written after Madame\nBlavatsky had had years of practice. I therefore re-submitted to him\nthe K. H. writings belonging to l\\Iessrs. Massey and Myers, which\nwe still had in our possession, together with the series forwarded\nby :Mr. Sinnett. The result was that Mr. Netherclift came to the con-\nclusion that the whole of these documents were without doubt written\nby Madame Blavatsky. Mr. Sims, of the British Museum, who had\noriginally expressed the same conclusion as Mr. Netherclift, similarly\nchanged his opinion after inspection of the documents furnished by Mr.\nSinnett.\nI may now give some of the results of my own comparison of these\ndocuments with the undisputed handwriting of Madame Blavatsky.*\nAt first sight Madame Blavatsky's ordinary handwriting, for the\nmost part small and somewhat irregular, looks very different from the\n. large, bold, round, regular writing of the K. H. documents. It is only\nwhen we examine closely the formations of individual letters that the\nb'aces of the same handiwork in both become obvious. The little\nimportance that can be attached to the mere general appearance of a\nwritten document is well enough known to persons who are at all\nfamiliar with the comparisons of handwritings.\nI shall now endeavour to show-\nI. That there are clear signs of development in the K. H. writing,\nvarious strong resemblances to Madame Blavatsky's ordinary hand-\nwriting having been gradually eliminated.\nII. That special forms of letters propel' to Madame Blavatsky's\nordinary writing, and not proper to the K. H. writing, occasionally\nappear in the latter.\nIII. That there are certain very marked peculiarities of Madame\nBlavatsky's ordinary writing which occur throughout the K. H.\nwriting.\nI shall specify, undel' each of these -heads, the most important\ninstances that I have observed, but shall not attempt to place before\nthe reader any exhaustive statement of them, as this would be tedious.\nI. Facsimiles of the series of K. H. letters lent by Mr. Sinnett\nwould perhaps have been interesting and suggestive to the reader, and\nwould have clearly shown the development of the K. H. hand; but\n.. In addition to the manuscripts which I have already mentioned &8 pro\u00b7\nviding me with a knowledge of Madame Blavatsky's ordinary handwriting, I\nhave in my possession various undisputed writings of hers produced between\n1877 and 1885, among which are three letters written to a Hindu in 18i8, three\nwritings to )lr. Hume about the years 1881\u00b71882, and other more recent letters\nto Messrs. Massey and Myers.\nu 2\n\f284 HI'. HodgsOil's RrjJol't\nMr. Sinnett strongly emphasized his desire that no use whatever should\nbe made of the specimens he submitted except for comparison of\nhandwriting, and the facsimile production of portions of the\ndocuments was, of course, impossible without the publication, to\nsome rlxtent, of theil' substance. I have therefore chosen se\\'eral\nsmoll letters, j, g, k and 1\/, for the purpose of illustrating the\ndevelopment I have mentioned. The groups of individuol letters in\nPlate I. are copied from tracings of my own made from the original\ndocuments, and hence many of them exhibit a tremulous appearance\nwhich is not characteristic of the original 1188., and which might have\nbeen avoided if the work had been done entirely by the lithographic\nartist. The letters in the first row of each of the groups of\nthe j, g, k, 1\/ are taken from undisputed writings of Madame\nBlavatsky, those to Mr. Hume already mentioned. These letters I\nshall call (B). The remaining five rows of each group are taken from\nthe first five documents of the K. H. series lent by lIr. Sinnett.\nThese I shall speak of as K. H. No.1, K. H. No.2, &c. The numbers\ndo not mean that these were the first five letters receh'ed by lIr.\nSinnett from \"K. H.\" Mr. Sinnett describes them as follows :-\n\" No. 1 * * * is the first sheet of the first letter I eyer had from\nhim certainly through another hand.\n\" Nos. 2 and 3 selections from later letters of the old series written\nbefore the publication of \u2022 The Occult World.' *\n\"No. 4 was received by me in London about the time \u2022Esoteric\nBuddhism' was published\u00b7t\n\"No.5 * * is from a letter certainly in K. H.'s own handwriting.\"\nThe j, it will be observed, in Madame Blavatsky's ordina.ry hand-\nwriting (B), is commonly looped only below, and is usually\npreceded by an up-stroke. It is easy to see the close correspondence\nbetween the\/'8 in (B) and those in K. H. No 1. Compare, moreover,\nthe sec~nd.ff in (B) with the.lf in K. H. No.2; the formation is\npeculiar and the resemblance striking. The type of the\/soon changes.\nIn K. H. No. I, the forms are almost all looped below, but in K. H.\nNo.2 they are generally looped above, and as we go on through Nos. 3,\n4, and 5, Madame Bla.\"vatsky's ordinary\/ gradually disappears; though\nhere and there in later K. H. documents astray\/looped only below\nmay be discovered, sometimes the upper loop is found to have been\nadded by an afterstroke, and the tendency to make \/,8 with a loop\nbelow is manifest.\nThe g'8 in K. H. No.1. are very various, but yet suggest an effort\nto introduce a new type. Various as they a.re, however, I believe that\n\u2022 II The Occult World\" (first edition) was published June 2nd, 188].\nt II El!Oteric Buddhism\" (first edition) was published June 8th, 1883.\nDigitized by Google\n\f01, PkeMmenrl connected trUk TheolJophy. 285\nby a careful search I might match almost every form in K. H. No. 1\nby a corresponding form from Madame Blavatsky's acknowledged hand-\nwriting. Even from the specimens given in (B) it will be perceived\nthat her g's vary greatly, and that there are one or two curious forms\nthat find fairly close parallels in K. H. Nos. 1 and 2.\nThe characteristic K. H. k, which is formed quite differently from\nMadame Blavatsky's, first appears, I think, in K. H. No.2, but is\nsomewhat narrower in formation than the type it ultimately reaches.\nSome of the k's in the group represent capitals, the capital k being\nformed on the same type as the small k. :Madame Blavatsky's\nordinary k is frequently preceded by an upstroke and consists of\n1\\ main downstroke from the bottom of which the next stroke starts\nupwards, trending to the right, without the pen's having been\ntaken off the paper. The final stroke is frequently added separately\nand often not connected with the rest of the letter; but in many\ncases the whole of the letter appears to be made in one continuous\nmovement. All these habits, together with other little peculiarities of\ncurvature, are clearly visible in the k's of K. H. No.1, and in later\nK. H. documents the gap between the two last strokes of the k con-\ntinues to be common. The last of the ~s selected from K. H. No.3\nis particularly noteworthy as exhibiting a lap8U8 calami which has\nbeen partially covered with the cloak of the K. H. k curvature.\nThe '!I's in the early K. H. documents, most of which have a\nnearly straight downstroke, with a little curl to the right, are just as\nsuggestive of Madame Blavatsky as are the \/'s, and they begin to\ndevelop nearly as rapidly as the g's and in the same direction, the\ndownstroke of both eventually ending in a pronounced curling curve to\nthe left, with the concave side habitually upwards. The letter j has\ndeveloped similarly, and so also apparently has the letter z, aU of\nthese letters finally exhibiting a similar curve to the left.\nIn the group of letters (B\"), all of which are taken from Madame\nBlavatsky's ordinary writing, I have given various forms of her t.\nAll these forms are common in the earliest K. H. documents;\nthe first three forms are common in the developed K. H.\nwriting, the peculiarity in the third form being the very small curl to\nthe right at the end of the downstroke. The fourth form occurs\noccasionally even in some of the latest K. H. writings which I\nhave seen, but in these I have observed no specimen at all of the fifth\nand sixth forms. The fifth and sixth forms, with the curious loop at\nthe bottom before tho stroke runs on to the next letter, abound how-\never in a large portion of the K. H. MSS. in my possession, written about\n1880-1882. The sixth form is apparently an offshoot of the fourth form,\nthe fifth being intermediate. The downstroke of the first form of t\nis almost universally non-loo~d, as represented ill the Plate, ill\nDigitized by Goo\n\f286 Mr. Hodg8on'8 Report\nMadame Blavatsky's ordinary writings of 18i8; similarly in the\nearliest K. H. writing; and though in the developed K. H. writing\nthis t is commonly looped, the non-looped form is very frequent. The\nlong dashes through or over the fs, which are a marked feature of the\nK. H. writing; may be merely the expansion of a habit of Madame\nBlavatsky's, in whose ordinary writings these dashes are just as\npronounced as they are in the earliest K. H. documents.\nPreceding upstrokes, which are prevalent in Madame Blavatsky's\nordinary handwriting, are far more numerous in the earliest than in\nthe latest K. H. documents.\nThe German type of d may be mentioned as a letter which has heen\ngradually eliminated from the K. H. writing, but I shall have more to\nsay abou~ this further on.\nI havA now in my hands the Koot Hoomi letter, the greater part\nof which is quoted by Mr. Sinnett in \"The Occult 'Vorld,\" pp. 85-95.\nIt bears the date of November 1st (1880), and is signed in full, \"Koot\nHoomi Lal Sing,\" by which name it may be designated. The second\ngroup of capital letters in the Plate is taken from this document; the\nfirst group, which I will call (B'), is taken from undisputed writings of\nMadame Blavatsky-from the same documents whence the small\nletters (B) are taken. These capital letters, A, D, F, P, T, require but\nlittle comment. The D, F, and T, of the Koot Hoomi Lal Sing are\nespecially suggestive of Madame Blavatsky's handiwork, and they soon\ndisappear from the K. H. documents. The hook above, at the\nend of the roof-stroke of the first Koot Hoomi T, presents a similar\nappearance to that shown by a form of T which occurs in a letter of\nMadame Blavatsky's in I8i8. The common forms of F and T in the\nK. H. writings are quite different from Madame Blavatsky's usual forms;\nthe specimens in square brackets represent the type commonly found\nin the Koot IIoomi Lal Sing. The characteristic features which occur\nin the P's of (B') and those of R.oot Hoomi Lal Sing may be noted.\nThe long preliminary upstroke, the crook to the left at the end of the\ndownstroke, seen also in the F's and the T's, the downward curl which\nbegins the umbrella curvature above, the turn to the left which ends it,\nand the little final scrape downwards. Some of these. as also some of\nthe characteristics of the D, remain throughout the K. H. writing, but\nothers almost completely disappear.\nII. \\Ve are now to consider letters which are proper to l\\ladame\nBlavatsky's ordinarywriting, and not to the K. H. writing, but which yet\noccasionally appear in the latter-apparently by mistake. An !Attempt\nis often made to remedy the mistake by afterstrokes, transforming the\nletter into the K. H. type. Such additions, reformations, cloakings\nand erasures occur in the case both of small and of capital letters; they\nappear to me to be especially significant, and to place it almost beyond\nDigitized by Goo\n\f01' Pl1elUJmena connected fDith The08())}hu. 287\na doubt that the person who wrote the K. H. MSS. where they occur\nwas in the habit of produt::ing a different handwriting, and that that\nperson was Madame Blavatsky. I find numel\u00b7OUS instances throughout\nthe K. H. documents which I have examined, but especially in the\nearlier ones, and will mention a few of the letters in which these mistakes\nha\\\"e been made. \u2022\nThe letter 6 in Madame Blavatsky's ordinary writing is uniformly\nmade upon the common type which we are all taught in copybooks, but\nwhen it begins a word in the K. H. writing, it is formed on the same\ntype as Madame Blavatsky's capital E in her ordinary writing. Yet\nin the early K. H. documents there are many instances where the initial\nsmall 6 was at first well formed in the ordinary way, and then transformed\ninto the other type by the addition of a second curve at the top; there\nare instances also where the transformation was never made, and the\ninitial 6 of the ordinary type still remains.\nInstances occur in the K. H. writings of the form of Ie which is\nmost characteristic of Madame Blavatsky; sometimes the form bas\nbeen cloaked by an afterstroke, as in the case a1ready mentioned, and\nsometimes not.\nThe letter x in the K. H. writings is formed even from the\nfirst in an entirely different way from that used by Madame Blavatsky\nin her' ordinary writing; a different form would seem to bave been\ndeliberately and successfully adopted. Nevertheless, there are one or\ntwo cases where Madame Blavatsky's ordinary x was first made,\nand the K. H. x superposed; and I have also discovered,\nin the Koot Hoomi writings now in my hands, two instances-pure\nand free, undimmed by any cloakings, and untouched by any after\u00b7\nstrokes-of Madame Blavatsky's own x. One of these stray X'8 abides\nnear thesheltering presence of a capital Q beginning theword \"Quixottes\"\n(sic.), which is suggestive of Madame Blavatsky's peculiar form, and\nwhich is very different from the Q which I have found oftenest in the\nK. H. writing. Another Q which I bave found in the K. H.\nwriting bears a much closer resemblance to Madame Blavatsky's\nordinary Q.\nThere are several conspicuous instances of alterations in the K. H.\ncapital B, Madame Blavatsky's usual form having been first made\neither partially or entirely. I have observed two very notable and\nindubitable specimens of this; an a1tered capital B, which the reader\nwill find in Plate II., K. H. (I), I regard as a doubtful case.\nMadame Blavatsky uses two forms of capital P, the one illustrated\nin the Plate, and another, perhaps the commoner of the two, which\nshows a very different type. I have seen a specimen of the latter in the\nK. H. 16!pp., and there are several very closely resembling it in the\nK. H. lISS. in my possession.\nDigitized by Google\n\f288 Mr. HodgBOlI's Report\nMany other instances might be given under this head, and some-\nthing like the counterpart of what I have been pointing out is also\ntrue-viz., that forms of letters proper to the K. H. writing, and not to\nMadame Blavatsky's ordinary writing, occasionally appear in the latter.\nThis is pel'llaps the most convenient place to mention the stroke\n'over the m. This stroke, which is a peculiar and apparently meaning-\nless feature of the K. H. writing, occurs several times oyer\nletters which resemble an English m in some Russian writing\nwhich I have seen by ?tladame Blavatsky. There are two Russian\nletters which resemble the English 111, and these, I am informed\nby Mr. W. R. S. Ralston, \"being much alike when written carelessly,\nthey are sometimes, but rarely, written\" with a stroke above and below\nrespectively. This may suggest the origin of the stroke over the 'I1l in\nthe Koot Hoomi writings.\nHI. I shall now proceed to show that there are fundamental\npeculiarities in some of Madame Blavatsky's formations of certain\nsmall letters which are found throughout all tllS K. H. writin[\/s\n,c!licldlKlve examined, except those wl~ich tll6re are strong positive grounds\nfor Gtt1'ibuting to the aut\/,orship ofMr. DG11Iodar.\nThe e,idence which we arc now to consider is, in my \"iew, the\nmost important of all in proof of the fact that the K. H. writings\nin general are the handiwork of Madame Blavatsky. This evidence\ndepends on :Madame Blavatsky's formation of the group of letters G, d,\n!J, 0, and q. The peculiarities exhibited in these letters are very\nstriking; they are sufficiently shown in the specimens of G, d, 0, and q,\nwhich I have gi\"en in group B\" (all the letters in which are taken\nfrom the undoubted writings of Madame Blavatsky), and are apparent\nalso in the clifferent groups of g'B which I have given as mani-\nfesting the evolution of the characteristic K. H. g. A properly mllde\n\" 0 \"formation is uncommon both in Madame Blavatsky's ordinary\nhandwriting and in the K. H. writings. If the letter requiring such &\nformation is initial, or not connected with the preceding letter, the\ntendency in both handwritings is to produce a formation akin to those\nshown in the first four a'B, the first three English d'B, and the first four q'B.\nIf the letter is connected with the preceding letter, the tendency is either\nto begin the \"0\" formation high up with a loop, as happens. most\ncommonly in the case of the d, leaving a gap above,-or to begin it\nlow down, in which case the curve is rarely closed by a complete\nbackward stroke,-and a peculiar gap therefore remains on the left-\nhand side. This last method of formation, which I shall call the left-\ngap stroke, may be clearly seen in some of the q'B and 0'8, and is yet\nmore noticeable in the g's and a's, of which last especially it is\nIllS common, conspicuous, and mOBt ltigTtly characteristic feature. botlt in\nMadarlle Blavatsky'B ordinary writing and in tho8e K. 1I. W'I-itings\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Phenomena connected frill, TIIC080phy. 289\nttJlticl, I attribute to her.* It is so peculiar, that were it found but\nra.rely in both sets of writings, 01' commonly in one and rarely in\nthe other, it would still be a tolerably definite indication of identity\nof handiwork; but when we find, as we do, that it occurs constantly\nin both sets of writings, that any other fOl'm (except the initial\nforms spoken of) is comparatively rare, and that numerous varieties\nof the type in the one set of writings can be exactly paralleled\nin the other, there can, I think, be little doubt that one and the same\nperson wielded the pen throughout. Only a few specimens of these\npeculiar letters are given in the plate. Sometimes the stroke ends by\nrolling into the right-hand part of the curve, so that in the case of the\na the remaining part of the letter, which is commonly made\n';'ith a new stroke of the pen, appears to be ahnost or quite\ncontinuous with the first stroke. Frequently the second part\nof the letter is quite unconnected with the first part, and frequently it\nbegins in the heart of the space partially enclosed by the first stroke.\nSometimes, again, the first stroke travels farther back to the left than\nits origin, still leaving a gap, and sometimes, but seldom, it even joins\nits ongin, so as to form a complete enclosure. It must be difficult for\nany person to trace this lift-gap stroke throughout a series of Madame\nBla.vatsky's acknowledged writings, and throughout a set of what I\nbelieve to be her K. H. writings, comparing in detail all the\nswirling tricks and fantastic freaks of curvature which it adopts, and\nat the same time resist the impression that the same person executed\nthem all.\nThere are two types of d given in the plate, which I may speak of as\nthe German d (enclosed in square brackets) and the English d. It is the\nEnglish type which is ahnost universally assumed by the din all but the\nearliest writings; while the German type is now ahnost exclusively used\nby Madame Blavatsky in her ordinary writing. In the early Koot Hoomi\nwritings, however, there are many instances of the German d, and in\nMadame Blavatsky's writings of 1878 and 1879 the English d frequently\noccurs. The first part of the English d is formed like the initial a's, or with\na loop, and there is frequently a wide gap between the loop and the final\ndown stroke of the letter, which is often clipped short, as shown in some\nof the instances in the Group (B\"). This looped d with the wide gap and\nthe clipped down stroke 1 shall call the clipped loose d ; it is the character\u00b7\nistic form of the developed K. H. writing, and among the English d's\nof Madame Blavatsky's undoubted handwriting it is also of common\noccurrence. But some persons who possess writings of Madame\n.. Mr. Gribble, in his pamphlet, \"A Report of an Examination into the\nBltwatsky Correspondence,\" &c., has drawn special attention to this left gap-\nstroke in Madame Blavatsky's ordinary writing, and to the significance of it!S\nOI.'Cllrrence in some K. H. writing.\nDigitized by Goo\n\f290 JII'. Hodgson's Report\nBlavatsky may, perhaps, be unable to find any specimens at all of the\nEnglish cl in her writing; and this brings me to the additional evidence\nwhich I said at the beginning of this part of my report would be forth-\ncoming in proof of the fact that Madame Blavatsky wrote the Blavatsky-\nCoulomb letters.\nIn three letters written by Madame Blavatsky in 1878, the English\nd occurs about 80 times and the German d about 340 times. In a letter\nto Mr. Massey of July, 1879, the English d occurs about 130 times and\nthe German d about 525 times. In her three writings to Mr.\nHume, already mentioned, of about 1881-82, the English d occurs\n4 times and the German d about 674 times. In three letters (and two\nenvelopes) to Mr. Massey in 1884 the English d occurs 6 times and the\nGerman d about 1106 times. In four letters (and two em-elopes) to Mr:\nMyers in 1884 the English d occurs 5 times and the German d about\n400 times. In the Elberfeld letter to Dr. Hartmann, 1884, d occurs\n39 times, and is always of the German type.\nIn the B. ReplieB the English d occurs about 140 times and the\nGerman d about 220 times, and in B. Marginal Kotes the English d\noccurs 6 times and the German d about 89 times. These writings were\nproduced in the time covered by the last few days of 1884 and the\nfirst few days of 1885, the Marginal KoteB being for the most part\nslightly later than the Replies.\nNow, it can hardly fail to be regarded as singular that the English\nd being thus frequent (about 210 to 865) in Madame Blavatsky's\nordinary writings in 1878 and 1879, and being thus rare (15 to\nabout 2,200, and 7 out of these 15 occur on envelopes) in Madame\nBlavatsky's writings from 1881 to 1884, should suddenly be found in\nsuch abundance as appears in the B. Replies, and I have been\nable myself to account for this singular fact in only one way. Before\nMadame Blavatsky's arri\"al at Adyar at the end of 1884, l\\Ir. J. D. B.\nGribble, of Madras, had published\" A Report of an Examination\ninto the Blavatsky Correspondence Published in the Cl,riBtian\nCollege J\/agazine,\" and in that report he drew special attention,\nin connection with the Blavatsky-Coulomb letter dated .1st April,\n1884, to the uniformity of the small d of the German type. Now\nl\\Iadame Blavatsky knew that I was desirous of obtaining 1\\ specimen\nof her undoubted writing for the purpose of testing the Blayatsky-\nCoulomb letters; and she knew that I would not use a letter profeB8edly\nwritten to meet my requirement since I had already declined the offer\nmade by Colonel Olcott, I assume at her instigation, that she should\nwrite such a letter (see p. 281). Is it not possible that she hoped, neYer-\ntheless, that I might use as my standard a document written by her\nostensibly with quite another object 1 Had I used the B. Replie8, with\nits numerous English els, as a standard of reference for the Blavatsky-\nDigitized by Google\n\f0\" Phenomena connected Iritll Theosophy. 291\nCoulomb letters, I should have been compelled to conclude that the rarity\nof the English d in the disputed documents was certainly an argument\nin favour of their having been forged. But a comparison of the B. Replies\nin tills respect with other writings of Madame Blavatsky shows that\nunquestionably this frequency of the English d is foreign to Madamo\nBlavatsky's ordinary writing produced about the same time as the B.\nReplies, or during the four previous years. I cannot help thinking\ntherefore that the use of these English d's was deliberate, and that\nthey were inserted for the special purpose of misleading me in one of\nthe most important parts of my investigation. In one or two other\nminor points Madame Blavatsky has also, I think, in the B. Replies,\naltered her usual handwriting. If I am right in this conclusion it\nwould follow that Madame Blavatsky has resorted to a device which an\ninnocent person would scarcely be likely to adopt; and when I take all\nthe circumstances into consideration, remembering especially that\nl\\Iadame Blavatsky was entirely unaware, as I believe, that I intended\nto send some of the disputed documents to England for examination-\nthe manuscript in question affords, in my opinion, strong confirmatory\nevidence of her authorship of the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters.\nTo return to the K. H. writings, it is strongly suggested by the\nforegoing facts concerning Madame B,lavatsky's d's that, since the\nappearance of K. H. writing with the English d as the regular form,\nshe has aimed at eliminating the English type from her ordinary hand-\nwriting, and using there the German type; but what we ha~e especially\nto note here is that the very marked peculiarities which characterise\nthe formation of the English d in her acknowledged handwriting,\nalso characterise its formation in the K. H. manuscript which I\nattribute to her.\nThere are other minor peculiarities common to both sets of writings.\nOne of these, which occurs in the formation of the letter \" deserves\nspecial mention, and several specimens are given in the Plate (B'I\n). When\nfinal, it is frequently clipped very short; not only is the last upstroke\nfrequently wanting, but the main downstroke is often carried no further\nthan its junction with the first upstroke of the letter, so that the letter\nremains as a mere loop. Moreover, in the case of ll, the second l is\nnot only frequently clipped short, but it takes a different angle from\nthat of the previous l (compare also thejf), not rising so high, and pre-\nsenting the appearance of tumbling over to the right. These forms of\n1 are common both in Madame Blavatsky's undoubted writing, and in\nthe K. H. MSS. which I believe to have been written by her.\nThe peculiar formations in the group of letters a, a, g, 0\nand q, were entirely absent from the K. H. (Y), but they wero\npresent in the other K. H. documents which I had the opportunity\nof carefully examining in India. In some of these latter documents\nDigitized by Goo\n\f292 Mr. Hodg8on\" Report\nthere were further traces of Madame Blavatsky's handiwt'lrk-e.g.,\nin the K. H. 16ipp. there were various alterations, and the word\nor letters altered were usually crossed out, but in three places\nca.reful erasul\"es hOO been made, and these erasures were just where\nthe K. H. k had been afterwards formed. In two of these\ncases I was unable to determine what the previous formation had\nbeen, but in the third I could still trace the outline of Madame\nBillovatsky's characteristic k. In another place in the same MS., the\nword \"Buddhist\" had been inserted a.fterwards in faint lead-pencil;\nthis was written in Madame Blavatsky's ordinary handwriting; upon\nit had been written, in ink, the same word in the K. H. writing, but\nthe pencil marks had not been erased. In the K. H. document alleged\nby Madame Fadooff to have been received by her at Odessa from\" Ull\nmessager afigure asiatique, qui disparut BOUB nl.\"..8 yeux ni>2mes,\" Madame\nBlavatsky's characteristic (I formations were present, and there were\nalso many instances of the after stroke transforming a well-formed copy-\nbook e into the Greek type. These were the most noticeable of those\nfeatures of the document\u00b7 which struck me in the two or three minutes'\ninspection of it which I had the opportunity of making.\nI have, I think, said enough to justify my conclusion that Madame\nBlavatsky was the writer of nearly all the K. H. documents which I\nhave seen. And since those which I attribute to her include, among\nothers, the whole of the K. H. manuscript forwarded to me by Mr.\nHume, as well as every specimen of the series lent to us by Mr. Sinnett,\nI think I may assume that by far the greater portion of the K. H.\nlISS. is the handiwork of Madame Blavatsky. .\nDifferent specimens of Madame Blavatsky's ordinary writing and\n\u2022 I think it not improbalJle that this document was written by l\\Iadame\nBla\\'atsky in 18i9 or 1880 when the idea of corresponding with one of the\n\"Brothers\" appears to have been first mooted. In weighing the statement of\nMadame Fadealf that ahe received the document about the year 1870, we shouM\nremember that Rhe is a RUS8ian lady, and the aunt of Madame Blavatsky, and\nthat Madame Blavatsky may have been influenced by political motives in the\nfounding of the Theosophical Society (viti. p. 314). It may be mentioned here\nthat Madame Blavatsky, when she heard that Mr. HomlUsji had given e\\idence\nthat he had received a brooch from her for repair, which resembled the one\nafterwards produced at Simla for Mrs. Hwne, first allel,red (to Mr. Hume) that\nthe brooch Mr. Hormusji had seen was square, and a few days later (to myself)\nthat it was roltlld, and had, indeed, some resemblance to 1\\Irs. Hume's, that she\n(1\\Iadame Blavatsky) had pnrchMed it fOl' her niece, and that I could obtain\nconfinnation from Madame Fadealf. Considering Madame Blavatsky's con-\ntradictory statements abont the brooch, this ready reference to 1\\Iadame }o'adrelf,\nin connection with it, suggests that she WaM a convenient person to appeal\nto when no other corroboration of Madame Bla\\'atsky'\" assertions could b3\nobtained.\nDigitized by Google\n\f0\" Phenomena connected rcit!1 T1IeOBOphy. 293\nthe K. H. writing may be seen in the Plates which accompany this\nReport, and Mrs. Sidgwick's corroboration of my observations will be\nfound in Appendix XV.\nI shall now proceed to give the barest possible outline of the results\nof my examination of sundry other documents, and begin with the\nK. H. (Y). It was this letter to which Dr. Hartmann referred when\nhe wrote to us last year that it was \"handed to me by Damodar, who\nreceived it in my presence from the hands of the astral\/orm of a.\nChela.\" In his pamphlet, p. 33, he wrote also: \"we . . were engaged\nin drawing up the charges [against the Coulombs] in my room, when\nthe astral body of a Chela appeared, and handed the following letter\nto Damodar.\" Madame Blavatsky, in a letter to Mr. C. C. Massey, on\nMay 4th, 1884, wrote, apparently concerning this letter: \"When the\nCouncil assembled and the Board of Trustees were ready to lay the\nblack charges against her and ha.ve her expelled-there falls on the\ntable a letter of Mahatma K. H. to the Board, and de\/ending ller,\nspeaking with his Christ-like forgiveness and kindness, and saying that\nshe was a t1ictim and not a culprit, and that it would one day be\nproved.\" I asked Dr. Hartmann about this incident, and he told me\nthat Mr. Damodar had lift ti,e room (Dr. Hartmann's), where he had\nbeen talking with Dr. Hartmann, but had returned almost immediately\nwith the letter in question, saying that he had just received it from\nthe \"astral form of a Chela\"! Madame Coulomo alleges that she\npeeped through a small hole which she had previously bored through\nthe wooden partition whic~ formed one side of Mr. Damodar's room,\nand that she &aW him preparing this Mahatma letter; and I certainly\nfound a small hole such as\u00b7 Madame Coulomb described to me, which\nlooked as if it had been made on purpose to serve as a spy-hole.\nOn comparing the K. H. (Y), in India., with ether K. H. MSS. in my\nhands at the time, I noted that there was a close similarity as regards\nparticular characteristics of the K. H. writing, as in the curls to the left\nof the downstrokes of g, j and 1\/, the stroke over the m, the formation of\nthe initial small e, the z, p, &c. In short, those peculiar forms which\nI suppose Madame Blavatsky to have deliberately and successfully\nemployed ill the developed K. H. writing, and which she would\nnaturally teach as characteristics of the handwriting to any person\nwhom she wished to train in the art of writing it) were strongly marked\nin the K. H. (Y). There were, however, certain differences between\nthis document and the other K. H. writings with which I compared it.\n1. It contained not a ringle i1l8taw.:e qf the \"le.ft-gap Btroke,\" or of\nde clipped loose d.\n2. There was not a single upstroke preceding the words, 31 in\nnumber, beginning with m, n, or i.\nDigitized by Google\n\f294 Mr. Hodg8on's Report\n3. The abbreviated 4: was very different from any specimen in the\nother K. H. writings.\n4. The curl to the left o.t the end of the downstroke in g, j, and y,\nwas made stiffiy, starting abruptly from the end of the downstroke.\n5. It showed a habit of strongly looping the main downstrokes of\ncertain letters-a habit which appeared especially in the capital M and\nthe small d. This habit is, in the case of these letters, foreign to the\nordinary K. H. writings, but is eminently suggestive of Mr. Damodar's\nhandiwork.\n6. The capital D was different from either of the two forms usual\nin the K. H. writings. The final loop of the D touched without\npaasing to the left of the main downstroke. This D was a facsimile of\nsome which I found in Mr. Damodar's ordinary writing.\n7. There were six instances of a peculiar small a, of which I\ncould not find a single instance in the K. H. 16!pp., but which is\nvery common in Mr. DlI.modar's ordinary writing.\n8. The style was much less flowing than is usual in the K. H.\nhandwritings, but I do not attribute much importance to this fact.\nThere were other minor differences, and my examination of the\ndocument led me to the conclusion that it was certainly not written.\nby Madame Blavatsky, and that it was probably written by Mr.\nDamodar. This conclusion has been strengthened by my examination\nof a document, which I shall call K. H. (Z), submitted to us for\nexamination by Mr. B. J. Padshah, who receivfd it last year direct\nfrom Adyar, in reply to a letter which he had sent, and who thinks\nthat Madame Blavatsky could not have known anything about the\nletter, she being at the time in Europe. The let!er is about the same\nlength as K. H. (Y), nearly two pages of note-paper.\n1. It contains not a single insto.nce of the peculiarities which I\nhave described in the group of letters a, el, g, and o. (The letter q does\nnot occur.)\n2. There is only one case of a preceding upstroke in the 16 words\nbeginning with i, and only one very doubtful case of a preceding upstroke\nin the 18 words beginning with m or n.\n3. It contains an abbreviated tI: of the same formation as that\nnoted in the K. H. (Y).\n4. The turns to the left at the end of the downstroke in g, j, and '!I\nhave an angular corner, and the cUrYature of the stroke to the left is\nalways concave downwards, never concave upwards.\n5. Several of the 1\u00a38 have the main downstroke very strongly\nlooped.\n6. A capital L on the envelope is different from any L which I haye\nfound in what I may now call the Blavatsky K. H. writings.\n7. Mr. Damodar'a peculiar a formation, which I will describe\nDigitized by Google\n\f011 Phenomena connected frill, The080p\"!\/. 295\npresently, is obvious in two 0,'8, and there are clear traces of it in other\n0,'8, which are now somewhat blurred. A similar formation occurs in\nsix 0'8, and the tendency to this formation in other instances is\nmanifest.\n8. The style is less flowing than is usual in the K. H. handwritings.\n9. The main downstroke of the initial t [type of the first t in the\nB' group] of a word is invariably strongly looped; and that of the\nfinal t [type of the second t in the B\" group] is almost invariably\nlooped. .\n10. The main downstroke of the b and the'\" is invariably looped.\nBoth K. H. (Y) and K. H. (Z) are written in blue pencil, whert'as\nthe K. H. documents which I have hitherto discussed are chiefly written\nin ink. Lest it should be maintained that the differences noted are\ndue to this, I shall now compare this K. H. (Z) with another K. H.\nletter, also in blue pencil (Spp.), and written approximately at the\nsame tmle. It was received by Mr. Myers from the hands of Madame\nBlavatsky when she was in Cambridge last year, and. I find-\n1. That the Blavatskian peculiarities which I have described in the\ngroup of letters a, d, g and 0, abound throughout. .\n2. That of thefirst 16 words(excludingfour doubtful cases) beginning\nwith t, 10 have a preceding upstroke. and that of the first IS words\nbeginning with In or n, 9 ha.ve a preceding upstroke.\n3. The form of tI: is different from the form in K. H. (Z).\n4. The corners of the turns to the left at the end of the down-\nstrokes in g, j and 1\/ are almost invariably rounded and the curvature\nof the stroke to the left is almost invariably concave upwards.\n5. There is no instance of a d with its main downstroke strongly\nlooped.\n6. A capital L which occurs is different from tllat in K. H. (Z).\n7. There is one solitary instance (ill the Spp.) of an a formation\nwhich resembles those common in Mr. Damodar's writing, but the\nspecimen is somewhat doubtful. There is no tendency to this formation\nin other instances.\nS. The style of handwriting is much freer and swifter than that of\nthe K. H. (Z).\n9. The downstroke of the initial t is rarely 80 strongly looped as in\nK. H. (Z), and is frequently not looped at all; and that of the final t is\ncommonly not looped.\n10. The main downstroke of the band the'\" is frequently not looped.\nThere are other points of difference between the two documents,\nwhich, however, it is unnecessary to enumerate.\nOn the importance of (1) I need not dwell any further. The\ncontrast noted in (2) is also true to a certain extent in j, u and to. To\nnone of these letters when beginning a word is there any preceding up-\nDigitized by Google\n\f296 NI'. Hodg8on'8 Repo\"t\nstroke in K. H. (Z). Preceding upstrokes to the letters mentioned are\ncommon in Madame Blavatsky's ordinary writing, but except in the\ncases of m and n,* comparatively rare in Mr. Damodar's ordinary\nwriting. Thus in a letter of his, written last year, there are\n17 initial i's, and only two have the upstroke; there are 31 initial\nlIl'S, and not one has the upstroke, though there may be a slight doubt\nin two cases.\nThe strong looping of the main downstroke of the d is\ncharacteristic of Mr. Dl\\IDodar's writing, as may be seen from tIle\ninstances in Plate I., Group (D). The specimens in this Group are\ntaken from a letter written hy Mr. Damodar in August, 1884. The\nlast instance is especially peculiar, where the upstroke touches the\ninitial point of the letter and the main downstroke cuts the initial\nstroke, which thus divides the extraordinary loop of the d into two\nparts. There is a conspicuous example of exactly this form in the\nK. H. (Z). It is also particularly to be observed that not only is there\nno instance of the clipped loose d, but there is never the slightest\ntendency to such a fonnation. There is not a single instance where the\npreceding letter runs into the initial stroke of the d so as\nto form a. loop with it, and the structnre of the letter\nthroughout exactly conforms to the structure of the English\nd found in Mr. Damodar's ordinary writing. Mr. Damodar\nindeed frequently leaves a gap in his ordinary writing between the\nbeginning of the d and the main downstroke; this seems to be partly\ndue to rapid writing, but there is apparently one instance of it in the\nK. H. (Z), and two other instances may be considered doubtful, though\nI think myself, after careful examination with a lens, that the appear-\nance of a gap in these two cases is due simply to the attrition of the\nfirst part of the pencilled stroke. The other most important trace of\nMr. Damodar's handiwork in the K. H. (Z) is the presence of what I\nshall call the beaked a formation, of which several instances are given in\nthe Plate (Group D). The initial point of U.e letter is considerably farther\nto the right than the top of the straight downstroke of the letter, which,\nmoreover, does not reach so high as the upper curvature. It is this\nbeaked a formation to which I refer above in (7) ; it is yery common\nill Mr. Damodar's ordinary writing.\nMy own view is thatMr. Damodar unquestionablywrote the K. H. (Z)\nas well as the K. H. (Y). lIr. Netherclift has had no opportunity of\nseeingthe K. H. (Y), which was only lent to me for a short time in India.,\nl)ut the K. H. (Z) was submitted to him with the other K. H.\n\u2022 The initial curve beginning the tn or n strictly fonus part of the letter in\noniinary writing, but in the K. H. writing these letters are made on the\npattern of the letters i and ft, so that the absence of a first upstroke is les'S\ncurious than it would otherwise be.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Phenomena cOllntcfed \",ith TlIe08&pll!\/. 297\ndocuments upon which he was asked to give a second opinion, with the\nadditional light afforded by those lent to us by Mr. Sinnett. Mr.\nNetherclift, in his second report, stated as his opinion that it was \"quite\nimpossible that Damodar could have accommodated his usual style to\nsuit that of K. H.,\" and although he admitted that he was unable\nto find in it an instance of what I have called the le\/t-gap 8trok6, and\nthat it was less like Madame Blavatsky's than other of the K. H.\ndocuments, he appeared to think that this may have been due to the\nincreased wariness of Madame Blavatsky, and-placed it with the others as\nbeing unmistakably her handiwork. I then submitted to him my\nanalysis of the document, and he kindly undertook to make a further\nexamination, expressing his confidence that he would prove to me.that\nthe conclusion which I had reached was erroneous. The result, how-\never, of a prolonged comparison which he then made was that he frankly\nconfessed that my viewwas the correct one, saying that in the whole course\nof his many years' experience as an expert, he had \"never met a more\npuzzling case,\" but that he was at last\" thoroughly convinced that\" the\nK. H.(Z) \"was written by Damodar in close imitation ofthe style adopteel\nby Madame Blavatsky in tbe K. H. papers.\"\nSpecimens of the K. H. (Z) and the other K. H. letter with\nwhich I have compared it are given in Plate II., and it may be\nnoticed that the K. H. characteristics in the former are almost\nall rigidly of one variety, as we might expect to find in the work of a\ncopyist adhering to biB lesson.\nI may here make brief reference to a long account of the professed\nexperiences of a native witness, which was sent to the headquarters of\nthe Theosophical Society while I was in India. Mr. Bhavruri Shankar\nalleged that he was copying this account for me, and that he had\nalready copied a portion of it. At the time I thought it rather odd\nthat I never saw him actually engaged in the copying, and when after\nthe lapse of some days I found that the .document was not ready, I\ndoubted whether I should receive it at all. Eventually, however, I did\nreceive it, and with the explicit declaration of Mr. Bhavani Shankar\nthat it was his copy. The pointedness of his assurance that he had\nmade the copy caused me to wonder slightly why he was so anxious to\nlet me have what I should know was a specimen of his handwriting; and\nthe probable explanation did not occur to me till some time afterwards,\nwhen I was struck by observing, in the document in question, some\npeculiarities which I had noticed in the ordinary writing of Mr.\nDamodar. I then made a careful examination of the document,\nand found that it had every appearance of having been written by Mr.\nDamodar, beginning with an elaborate though clumsy attempt at\ndisguise, and ending with what can hardly be called any disguise at all.\nThis incident has confirmed me in my opinion of the untrustworthiness.\nv\nDigitized by Google\n\f298 J-llr. Eoagsol\/', Report\nof both Mr. Damodar ancl Mr. Bhavani Shankar. But Il.S to why Mr.\nBhavani Shankar should have made this attempt to deceivo me con-\ncerning the characteristics of his handwriting, I have only a conjectural\nTiew.\nMy examination of another document which I saw in India con-\nfirmed me in my opinion of the untrustworthiness of Mr. Babajee D.\nNath. This document was written in green ink, and purported to be\nthe work of a Chela B. D. S. (Bhola. Deva Sarma). The disguise seemed\nto me to be very puerile, most of the letters being of the copy-book\ntype; one or two of Mr. Babajee's habits being traceable throughout,\nwhile the name Datll, which occurred in it, was almost a facsimile of a\n\"No.th\" which I found in Mr. Babajee's ordinary signature.\nThe forged Hartmann document (see p. 280), which I believe to ha.ve\nbeen forged by Madame Bla.vatsky, for the purpose of attributing it to\nthe Coulombs, was alleged by some Theosophists to have been the work of\nthe Coulombs, on the ground that the sentence, \"Excu.se short letter. I\nam writing in the dark,\" suggested a peculiarity of Madame Coulomb's,\nthat \"writing in the dark\" meant \"writing in a hurry,\" and in proof\nof this an old letter of Madame Coulomb's, in which she used a similar\n. expression, was produced\/rom the possession 0\/Madam~ Blamtsky. I\nsaw this letter, and the expression there appeared to me to be meant\nliterally. The forged document may possibly have been intended to\nbear traces of its forgery on the face of it, though of this I cannot be\nsure. The imitation of Dr. Hartmann's characteristics is for the most\npart exceedingly close, and on this point I must differ entirely from\nMr. Gribble,* who was evidently unfamiliar with Dr. Hartmann's\nwriting; moreover, bad spelling is noticeable in the document, and bad\nspelling of a similar character is noticeable also in Dr. Hartmann's\nwritings; but Dr. Hartmann himself asserts that the letter is a forgery,\nand the fact that it contains fourteen remakings of letters is enough to\nconfirm his statement. Although there were 14 remakings of letters,\nthere was only one eraBUre; this was in the k of the word dark. Dr.\nHartmann's k is peculiar; so is Madame Blavatsky's; but the\nerasure had been so thoroughly made that I was unable to trace the\n\u2022 II A Report of an Examination into the Blavataky Correspondence,\" &c.,\np. 7. Mr. Gribble says :_CI The only instance in wIdch any resemblance to\nDr. Hartmann's writing ill to be found is in the formation of the capital H,\" and\nhe mentions the capital letters A and T, and no others, ~ exhibiting\npeculiarities which reminded him of \"similar letters to be found in Madame B.'8\nacknowledged writings.\" The A and T are, in my opinion, not more suggestive\nof Madame Blavataky than the A and T of Dr. Hartmann's undoubted ordinary\nwritings. I should say that Mr. Gribble had the opportunity of examining the\ndocument only very hastily during a short visit of an hour at the headquarters\nof the Theosophical Society, when he examined other documents also; and this\nDO d011bt accounts for the mistakes which he made in his examination of it.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Plumomella connected with Tlteosop\"g. 299\nshape of the letter first formed. I compared the document with\nwriting of M. and lIadame Coulomb, and could not find in it any\ntraces of their handiwork; but comparing it with Madame' Blavatsky's\nwritings, I found several, and these instances formed the only diver-\ngencies which I observed from Dr. Hartmann's formations. I attach\nimportance to the following :-\n1. The figure\" 8 \" in the dating of the letter was not Dr. Hartmann's,\nbut Madame Blavatsky's.\n2. A capital S was not Dr. Hartmann's, but Madame Blavatsky's.\n3. A small z was very differe~t from Dr. Hartmann's, and was\nalmost a facsimile of the careful z in the K. H. writings, which also\nshows exactly the same type as the careful z (very rare) in Madame\nBlavatsky's ordinary writing, except that the former terminates in the\nleftward curl, \",hile the latter terminates in the usual copy-book up-\nward stroke, trending to the right, cutting the lower part of the down-\nstroke, and thus forming a closed loop with it.\n4. Dr. Hartmann's small :I: is nearly of the common cory-book\ntype, the first half of the letter being formed like a reversed c; but it\nseems that he habitually keeps his pen upon the paper until he has com-\npleted the letter, so that from the end of the first part of the letter a\ndiagonal stroke runs up to the beginning of the second part, between the\nleft side of which and the right side of the first part there remains a gap,\nbridged by the cross stroke; at a first glance, the bridging stroke may\nescape notice, and the :I: appear to be of the copy-book form. Now:l:\noccurs three times in the forged Hartmann document. The first of these\nis formed without the bridge, and the two strokes of the letters touch\neach other. The second of them is formed like Dr. Hartmann's variety.\nThe third of them, however, which occurs in the last sentence of the\nletter, 'IDaIlfir8tformed as Madame Blavaes\",!!8 peculiar :1:, Dr.Hart1lUlnn'8\ntype beingformed over i' without any erfJ8Uri8 having been mark. On\ndose inspection this was clear even to the naked eye, and examination\nwith a lens rendered it absolutely unmistakable.\nLet us now consider the Maltatma M. endor8e1netU on the forged\nHartmann document.\n1. In five of the seven r's the upper loop has unmistakably been\nadded by an after stroke, and apparently in the other two also. Very\nheavily crowned r's are characteristic of the M. writing; but Madame\nBlavatsky in her ordinary writing is frequently obliged to twirl the top\nof the r with an afterstroke. (Mr. Gribble also regarded the r's of this\ndocument as suggestive of Madame Blavatsky.)\n2. The letter g in the words good and forgery exhibits the peculiar\nleft-gap stroke. The gap in the g of good has been partly filled by another\nstroke, and this also occasionally but rarely happens both in Madame\nv 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f300 HI'. Hodgson's Report\nBlavatsky's ordinary writing and in the K. H. writing. (See the final\naandoin the Plate, Group B\".)\n3. The letter following the t in the word \"enterprising\" was\nmanifestly first made as Madame Blavatsky's left-gap stroke Q. The\nword has apparently been first spelt \"entaprising,\" and the second\npart of the Q altered into an r by the addition of a very grotesque\nloop, awkwardly placed in consequence of the little room left for it.\nI suppose that Madame Blavatsky, having forged the document in\nDr. Hartmann's writing, and enclosed it in a \"cover postmarked Madras,\"\nin which Colonel Olcott might receive it, afterwards obtained it again\nsurreptitiously (on finding, as I conjecture, that Colonel Olcott was not.\nbringing forward the document and stating that he believed it to be I\\-\nforgery, as she had intended him to do), wrote the endorsement in het~\ndisguised M. handwriting and replaced it in Colonel Olcott's.\ndespatch.box. If she had little time at her disposal in which to write\nthe endorsement, this would account for the exceptionally glaring\nindications of her handiwork which it contains.\nEveryone will admit, I think, that the forged Hartmann document\nmust have originated either with the Coulombs or with Madame\nBlavatsky. If the Coulombs were the authors, it is difficult to see\nthe point of the last sentence about \"writing in the dark,\" and if the\nphrase really illustrates a peculiarity of Madame Coulomb's, an old\nletter of hers in the possession of Madame Blavatsky being adduced\nas proof, the Coulombs would seem to have committed the very\ncurious mistake of inserting a statement for what looks like the specific\npurpose of indicating themselves as the authors. That they should\nnot only have done this, but have also perpetrated the marvellously\nsubtle fraud of making several slips in the forged document which\nshould be characteristic of Madame Blavatsky's handiwork, is a sup-\nposition which, I think, appears in itself somewhat absurd, besides\nbeing incompatible with the hypothesis which has been put forward\nthat they forged the letter in order to make mischief between the\nfounders of the Society and Dr. Hartmann and Mr. Lane-Fox; and\nit is difficult to see what other motive they could possibly have had.\nIn short, the hypothesis that the Coulombs forged the document is\nfraught with so many great difficulties that I do not imagine any\nimpartial reader will entertain it for a moment, or have any doubt\nwhatever that Madame Blavatsky wrote both the forged document\nand the l\\fahatma M. endorsement. Her action in this respect is in\nharmony with her action throughout, and her object* is not far to\n\u2022 I have already referred to Madame Coulomb's allegation that at the end of\nApril she wrote to Madame Blavatsky threatening to produce incriminating\nletters written by the latter.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOIJ Phenomena connected foit\" The080pk!l. 301\nseek.

How would a person of Madame BlavatAlky's genius be\nlikely to parry such a thrust 1 Not by a mere asaertion, but by a proof that\nforgery is in the air-that attacks upon Theosophy are being made through\nthe forger's pen.\"\nShe therefore forged a IHtter which would indubitably be shown to\nbe a forgery, and which, at the same time, should contain evidence\napparently pointing to the Coulombs as the authors. This evidence\n(the aforesaid phrase about \"writing in the dark\") appears to me to\npoint on the contrary to Madame Blavatsky herself as the author.\nI have not had specimens of the M. writing which would\nhave enabled me to make such a full examination as I have made of\nthe K. H. writing, but I have no doubt that all of the few short\nspecimens which I have had the opportunity of carefully examining\nmay have been, and that some of them unquestionably were, written by\nl\\Iadame Blavatsky. It occurred to me that the first M. writing\nmay have been written by Madame Blavatsky with her left hand, a.nd\nthat she afterwards imitated with her right hand the characteristics\nthus displayed; and on trying the experiment, making some of Madame\nBlavatsky's characteristic strokes, I found that several of her peculiarities\ntook the roughened form which I have observed in some of the M.\nwriting. But whether all the M. writing was the handiwork of\nl\\Iadame Blavatsky, or whether some of the earliest specimens were\nwritten by Babula under the guidance of Madame Blavatsky-as\nMadame Coulomb asserts-:or whether some other person had some share\nin their production, my limited acquaintance with the )ISS. has not\nprovided me with any means of determining. I observed in some\nspecimens which Mr. Ramaswamier allowed me to see, an instance of\nMadame Blavatsky's characteristic Ie, with another Ie formed over it, an\ninstance of her terminal r, and an instance of her peculiar:c. In\nperusing the Mahatma M. document which Mr. Damodar alleged had\nfallen into his room at Ootacamund, on April 26th, 1884 (see p. 279),\nI observed the following peculiarities ;-\n1. There were a capital H and a capital P which were varieties of\ncertain Hand P types found both in the K. H. and in Madame\nBlavatsky's ordinary writings.\n2. Many of the lis exhibited a double stroke which, though not a\nfacsimile of Madame Blavatsky's, was very strongly suggestive of her\nhandiwork.\nDigitized by Google\n\f302 HI'.

(See Plate I.)\n5. In two words the initial tl had been first made in the common\ntype, and had afterwarda been altered into the Greek form.\n6. In at least four cases the top of the\" had been added by an.\nafter stroke.\nA complete examination of this document might have revealed more\nresemblances to Madame Blavatsky's ordinary handwriting, but I think\nthose above enumerated are, considering the circumstances of its ap-\npearance, enough to justify me in concluding that Madame Blavatsky\nwas the writer.* The substance of the document is certainly much more\nsuggestive of the cunning combined with the inevitable ignorance of\nMadame Blavatsky in Paris, than of any divine wisdom or knowledge\nof the supposed II Mahatma M.\" in India. The K.H. (Y) of March 22nd,\nand the Ootacamund M. letter of April 26th are not easily explained,\nexcept on the view that Mr. Damodar wrote the former and Madame\nBlavatsky the latter; for the documents absolutely contradict each\nother. But they admit of a satisfactory explanation when we fimt\nthat on March 22nd Mr. Damodar was doing his best to avoid a.\nrupture with the Coulombs, and that Madame Blavatsky, a week or so\nlater, ignorant of the change of position at headquarters, and ignorant\nthat Messrs. Lane-Fox and Damodar were at Ootacamund, while Dr.\nHartmann remained at Adyar, was preparing a Mahatma document\nto serve as a guard against the disclosure of the trick apparatus, just\nas she afterwards forged the Hartmann document to ward oft'the blow\nwhich fell in the publication of her own incriminating letters in the\nMadras Christian Col18g6 Magazine.\nEven greater ignorance, or a curious standard of morality, is\ndisplayed in another Mahatma document, written to Mr. Hume. It\ncontains a reference to a \"young man\" to whose rapid spiritual\ndevelopment II K.

H. letters received by Mr. Sinnett, upon which\n\"Esoteric Buddhism\" is confessedly founded, emanated from the brain\nof Madame Blantsky, how far she was assisted in their production by\nconfederates, how much of their substance was plagiarised from other\nwriters, are queBtions which lie somewhat out.side my present province.\nIn the light of the incident mentioned by Mr. Hume, where matter\nfurnished by an able native had been used in the preparation of\nl\\lahatma documents-we may regard it as not improbable that Madame\nBlavatsky has obtained some direct or indirect assistance from native\nlearning and native familiarity with Hindu Philosophy; and the\n\"Kiddie incident,\" where the charge of plagiarism has eventually\nbeen admitted, and the fraud attributed to a Chela.-is enough to\nshow that \"K. H.\" has not been above pilfering the very\nlanguage of a lecturer on Spiritualism. But apart altogether from\nsllch incidents as these, we must remember that Madame Blavatsky\nappeared in the last decade as the author of \" Isis Unveiled.\" It is not\ndenied that a similarity of style exists between a number of tbe K. H.\ndocuments and portions of \"Isis Unveiled\" ; the inference made by\nthose who accept tbe statements of Madame Blavatsky is that\nshe wrote neither; I think it much more probable that she wrote\nboth.\nMadame Blavatsky at times writes very strange English, or rather\n0. language which can hardly be ca.lled English. This, I believe, she\nfrequently does intentionally, and sometimes with good effect. Thus,\ntowards tbe close of a long passage in her ordinary handwriting, and in\nber good English style, she says that it was dictated to her by a \"greasy\nTibetan,\" and in wbat follows immediately afterwards, which of course\nwe are to notice is her own, she lapses into a markedly poorer form\n* It is noteworthy that in the same K.

Hodg8o\/l'8 Report\nof utterance. I have no doubt that she was fully aware* of the\nimportance of convincing adherents like Mr. Sinnett that she was\nunable to produce the K. H. writings, and that one of her devices\nto this end was the speaking and writing of purposely deteriorated\nEnglish. Her best English style appears to me to be essentially like\nthat of the K. H. writings, especially in the cumbrous and wordy form\nof sentence which so often appears, in the abundance of parenthetical\nphrases and in the occasional use of almost outre metaphors.\nThere are, indeed, certain oddities in Madame Blavatsky's English\nwhich are not feigned-in spelling, in the division of words at the end\nof a line, and in grammatical structure; but I find that these occur in\nthe K. H. writings also; where the frequency of dashes, underlinings,\nand expressions like \"please,\" \"permit me,\" &c., is further suggestive\nof Madame Blavatsky's work. I admit that some of the quotations\nwhich have been published by Mr. Sinnett, from the K. H. MSS.,\nattain a standard of style and reflective thought which I should not\nexpect Madame Blavatsky to maintain continuously through a long\nseries of documents, and I am accordingly not surprised to learn from\n!Ir. Hume, who received a large quantity of the K. H. MSS., and who\nbegan the writing of \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" that much of the K. H.\nwriting is considerably below the level of those fragments which have\nbeen published, and that the task of eliminating the vast mass of\nrubbish was exceedingly difficult. I conceive myself that it would be\nimpossible for the writer of the K. H. MSS. now in my possession to\nsubstantiate any claim to a familiarity with the principles of either\nScience or Philosophy, and-I see no reason why they should not have\nbeen written by Madame Blavatsky herself, without any assistance\nwhatever. To speak about \"a bacteria,\" !I.S K. H. does in one of these\ndocuments, is to show a knowledge neither of Biology nor of Philology;\nand to say, as K. H. does in another of these documents, \"that man has\na better prospect for him after death than that of turning into carbolic\n(sic) acid, water and ammonia\" t shows a lamentable ignorance of the\nconstitution of the Rupa, the ordinary human organism, the first of\nthe \"seven principles.\"\nIt would, however, be a tedious and a useless task to analyse these\nK. H. documents at length, and I shall now simply give a few instances\nof those points which admit of a brief illustration. I take the following\n.. This appears, e.g., in the following sentence of hers in a letter to Mr.\nHume, of 1882: \"You have either to show me as a champion liar, but ell\/willg,\nlogical and 'Yith a most phenomenal memory (instead of my poor failing brains),\nor admit the theory of the Brothers.\"\nt This reminded me of a passage in the CQ1ltemporary Review for September,\nISi6, p. 545: \"The man resolves into carbonic acid, water and ammonia, and\nhas no more personal future existence than a consumed candle.\"\n\fOIJ Phenomena connected fcitn Tlle080phl\/. 305\nfrom the Koot Hoomi Lal SiIng: \"Whatever helps restore\" [= what-\n,ever helps eo restore]. Also,\" You and your colleagues may help\nfurnish the materials.\" Similarly Madame Blavatsky writes, \"to help\nhim publish.\" The Koot Boomi Lal Sing, as I have already men-\ntioned, is quoted almost in its entirety by Mr. Sinnett, on pp. 85-95 of\n4' The Occult World.\" But the reader will find that the word to is\ninserted before its verb in Mr. Sinnett's version. I was certainly sur-\nprised on finding this, as Mr. Sinnett had written (\" The Occult\nWorId,\" p. 69);-\n\"I shall, of COUl'88, throughout my quotationa from Koot Hoomi'a letters\nleave out pauagea which, apecially addreaaed to myself, have no immediate\nbearing on the public argument. The reader must be careful to remember,\nhowever, as I now moat unequivocally affirm, that I shall in no case alt~1'\none ayllable of the paBll8g8s actually quoted. It is important to make this\ndeclaration very emphatically, because the \u00a5lore my readers may be acquainted\nwith India, the le88 they will be willing to believe, except on the moatpositive\ntestimony, that the letters from Koot Hoomi, sa I now publiah them, have\nbeen written by a native of India.\"\nYet on comparing the original document, Koot Hoomi Lal Sing,\nwith \"The Occult World,\" I find that there are more than ~t'JJ differ-\nences between the two (excluding mistakes of apelling-1Ult\". and\n1'emarqmd-and excluding also omisaion of underlinings, changes of\npunctuation, &c.). Many of these differences consist of words omitted\nor 'inserted, others of words changed, and although some of these\ndifferences may be resolved into misprints or mis-copies, by no\nmeans all of them can be explained in this way. For example, in\nthe original document I read; \"the difference between the modes of\nphysical (called exact often out of mere politeneu) and metaphysical\nsciences\" ; but in \"The Ocoult World\" (p. 88), politemll appears as\ncompliment. Again;\" Education enthrones skeptioism, but imprisons\nspiritualism \"; spiritualism in \"The Ocoult World\" (p. 94) appears\nas spirituality. Remarqued and politeness appear to me to be more\nsuggestive of Madame Blavatsky than of the K. H. desoribed to us,\nwhose peculiarities ought to be German rather than Frenoh;* and it is\ncurious that Madame Blavatsky, in a letter of last year to Mr. Myers,\nshould have drawn a contrast \"between spiritualism and materialism,\"\nwhere spiritualism is olearly intended to bear the same meaning as in\nthe passage quoted from the K. H. document. I do not suppose that\nMr. Sinnett himself knew anything of these and other alterations, but\n\u2022 Other mistakes suggesting that the writer wsa accustomed to Frenoh\nmay be found in different K.

H. documents that K. H. actually\nendeavoured to incite the recipient to what I think every honour-\nable Englishman would regard as a falsehood. The moral is toler-\naLly obvious, and the reader will perhaps rather expect the advanced\nChelas of \"Mahatmas\" to be, by virtue of that very position,\nuntrustworthy individuals. That there are persons whose actions\nare marked by the highest integrity, and who have devoutly\nand sincerely believed themselves to be acting under the tutelage\nof a \"l\\lahatma,\" I do not for a moment question; though there\nan be little doubt that there are also instances where Madame\nBlavatsky has endeavoured to persuade natives to pretend falsely\nthat they were Chelas, and in some cases, as I think I have shown,\nhas succeeded, but in other cases has failed. Mr. Hume has stated\nto me his conviction, founded on their own confessions, that certain\nnatives hOO been instigated by Madame Blavatsky to fraudulent\nassertion of their Chelaship, and to the conveyance of \"Mahatma\"\nmessages in the guise of Chelas; this would appear also from some\nof the documents forwarded to me by Mr. Hume ; and, quite indepen-\ndentlyof this evidence, I was assured by an educated native with whom\nI had a personal interview, that Madame Blavatsky had used her\npowers-not only of persuasioll, but of threatening-to induce him\nto further her objects, as explained to him, and to play the rfjle of\na dawning Adept. It is, in short, quite certain that there are\nnatives who have charged Madame Blavatsky with inciting them to\nthe fraudulent personation of Chelas of \"Mahatmas,\" and she seems\nto have worked upon patriotic feeling for the purpose of securing\n.heir assistance.\nI have now dealt with the main points of the evidence for the\nalleged marvellous phenomena in connection with the Theosophical\nSociety which were directly associated with my im'estigations in\nIndia, and I regard the details which I have given as sufficient to\nwarrant the conclusion which I expressed at the beginning of my\nReport, that these alleged marvellous phenomena have been fraudulent\nthroughout. The force of the evidence leading to this conclusion will\nhardly be appreciated except by those who have followed the accounts\ngiven in the Appendices, and it certainly cannot be conveyed in a\nmere summary. Yet I think it well that the reader should be reminded\nof the most important considerations which have arisen in the course\nDigitized by Google\n\f0,. PkenomellCl connected Itt'tll Tkeo8opl,y_ 309.\nof the inquiry, and I shall therefore suggest these once more-in as\nfew words as possible. But, before doing so, there are one ,or twO'\ncollater~1 questions which demand some brief reference.\nAt thfl time of our First Report, it appeared to us a serious difficulty\nin the way of adopting the hypothesis of fraud that we should have to-\nsuppose Mr. Damodar to have exchanged, within a comparatively short\ntime, the character of a confiding dupe for that of a thorough-going\nconspirator. This difficulty was impressed upon us all the more\u00b7\nstt'Ongly by the account of Mr. Damodar which we received from\u00b7\nColonel Olcott, who stated :- .\n.. His father was a wealthy gentleman occupying a high position in the-\nGovernment eecretariat at Bombay; and the son, besides the paternal\nexpectatiOnB, had, in his own right, about 50,000 or 60,000 rupees. The-\nfather at first gave his coneent to the BOn's breaking cute-a mOlt seriou\nstep in India.--so aB to take up our work. But lubBequently, on his death-\nbed, his orthodox family influenced his mind, and he demanded that his BOn\nIhould revert to his CaBte, making the uaual degrading penance required in\nluch C&B88. Mr. Damodar, however, refuaed, saying that he WaB fully\ncommitted to the work, which he considered mOlt important for his country\nand the world; and he ultimately relinquished his entire property, so that\nhe might be ablolutely free.\"\nThe impressiveness of this, however, was considerably reduced by\nfurther investigation, which revealed that Colonel Olcott's statement\ncom-eyed utterly erroneous ideas concerning the actual facts of the\ncase. From evidence I obtained in Bombay from several witnesses.\n6.nd from a. series of documents which I was allowed to peruse by\nan uncle of Mr. Damodar, and which consisted partly of letters\nwdtten by }lr. Damodar, it appeared that his father had been a.\nmember of the Theosophical Society, but that he had resigned all\nconnection with it in consequence of the conclusion he had reached that.\nthe founders of the Society were untrustworthy. It was also in\nconsequence of this conclusion that he so earnestly entreated his son\n(not to !' revert to his caste,\" but) to give up his connection with\nMadame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, or at least to live no longer in\nthe same house with them. It was, moreover, in consequence of the\nopinion which prevailed among some of Mr. Damodar's acquaintances.\nin Bomhay to the effect that Madame Blavatskyand Colonel Olcott\nhad sought to gain power over Mr. Damodar for the purpose of\nohtaining his money-that Mr. Damodar had expressed his desire to\nrelinquish his \u00b7property. And, according to the provisions of his.\nfa.ther's will, he may yet receh\u00b7e the property on certain conditions, of\nwhich the primary one is the severance of his connection with the\nTheosophical Society. I muat add that the correspondence to which\nI refer, which lasted over some months, afforded ample evidence that\nDigitized by Google\n\f310 Mr. DOOg801\"8 Report\n)Ir. Damodar's father had been painfully impressed hy his want of\ntruthfulness and honourable dealing.\nAt the time when Mr. Damodar desired to give up all claims to the\nproperty, he was, I think, not a confederate. When he first began to\nsuspect fraud, I have no means of ascertaining; but as regards the\ntransition from being a dupe to becoming himself a conspirator, there\nis this to be said.-There can he little doubt that patriotic feeling-\nwhich, I believe, has much more to do with the underworking of the\nTheosophical Society than the followers of Madame Bla.vatsky in\nEngland commonly imagine-was one of the strongest influences which\nattrs.llwd him to the Society, and which afterwards kept him an active\nworker in the movement. His bitter antipathy to the \"conquering\nrace\" was sufficiently obvious in those letters of his which I had the\nopportunity of perusing. To this we must add the fact that he had\nespoused the Theosophical cause and the claims of Madame Blavatsky\nwith a burning intensity of antagonism to those who alleged that these\nclaims rested on a foundation of dishonesty. Itwas not easy to confess\nto the world that the flaming ardour which resisted the tender and wise\nadvice of his father, and perhaps was fed by the importunate cautions\nand scoffings of his friends, was but the folly of an aspiring youth, who\n,vas not quite clever enough for Madame Blavatsky. And, after all,\nl1e might have the honour of posing as a Chela., with rapidly-developing\npowers, and receiving reverence and glory, not only fl'om his native\nassociates, but from Englishmen themselves. In the face of such\nconsiderations as these, the psychological revolution in which Mr.\nDamodar was transformed from a dupe, capable of deceh'ing his father,\nto an impostor in the supposed interests of his country, is perhaps not\nvery difficult to understand. There is no necessity for me to give all the\nresults of my inquiries concerning the personal charactel's and ante-\ncedents of those persons whom I regard as confederates of Madame\nBlavatsky. As Mr. Damodar is the only one of her followers who has\ndeprived himself of any substantial property by his action in connection\nwith the Theosophical Society, or who, in my opinion, can be said to\nl1a.ve sacrificed his worldly prospects, I have thought it desirable to\ndraw special a.ttention to the circumstances under which the sacrifice\nwas made.\nAfter reviewing the instances I have given of the unreliability of\nColonel Olcott's testimony, some readers may be inclined to think that\nColonel Olcott must himself have taken an active and deliberate part\nin the fraud, and have been a partner with Madame Blava.tsky in the\nconspiracy. Such, I must emphatically state, is not my own opinion,\nthough I should be unwilling to affirm that Colonel Olcott may not,\nby ca.rrying out supposed injunctions of his \"Mastel',\" haT'e improperly\ncontributed, either by word or action, to the marvellousness of certain\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn PlloJlomena connected fcith Tlte08opll!l. 311\nphenomena. It is clear, for example, from (locuments in my posses-\nsion, that the influence of \"K. H.\" has been exerted unsuccessfully\nin the case of another gentleman, fO&\" the purpose of strengthening the\nevidence for an alleged\" occult\" phenomenon, and I can well undel'lrtand\nthat Colonel Olcott may have been induced by the solemn asseverations\nof his \"l\\Iaster\" that certain events occurred, to remember incidents\nwhich never happened a.t all; and how much may have been exacted\nfrom his blind obedience it is impossible to determine. Further,\nhis capacity for estimating evidence, which could never have been very\ngreat, was probably seriously injured before the outset of his Theoso-\nphical career by his faith in Madame Blav&tsky, who herself regarded\nhim as the chief of those \"domestic imbeciles\" and \"familiar muffs\"\nto whom she refers in her letters to Madame Coulomb; and writing\nabout him from America to a Hindu in Bombay, she characterised him\nas a \"psychologised baby,\" sa.ying that the Yankees thought themselves\nvery smart, and that Oolonel Olcott thought he was particularly smart,\neven for a Yankee, but that he would have to get up much earlier in the\nmorning to be as smart as she was. His candour was shown by his\nreadiness in providing me with extracts from his own diary, and the\nfreedom with which he allowed me to inspect important document.\"I in\nhis possession; and he rendered me every assistance in his power\nin the way of my acquiring the evidence of the native witnesses. Not\nonly so, but observing, as I thought, that Mr. Damodar was unduly\nendeavouring to take part in my examination of a witness shortly after I\narrived in India, he desired me not to hesitate in taking the witnesses\napart for my private examination, and he made special arrangements\nfor my convenience. Not unmindful of the opportunities afforded me\nfor investigation by most of the Theosophists themselves, it is with all\nthe more regret that I now find myself expressing conclusions which\nmust give pain to so many of them. But Colonel Olcott himself would\nbe among the first to admit that the interests of truth must not be\nstopped or stayed by any merely personal feelings, and although in a\nletter to Madame Coulomb, he implied that his mind could not \"be\nunsettled by any trivial things \"-such as, among others, the making\nof trap-doors and other apparatus for trick-manifestations by Madame\nBlavatsky-he wrote also :-\n\"I do flot think it right or fair that YOli should continue to be a member\nof a Society which you thought flourishing by the aid of trickery and false\nrepresentation. If I thought my Society th\u00abt I would leave it, and wash my\nhands of it for ever.\"\nThis, however, is a course which probably Colonel Olcott's mind\nwill never be \"unsettled\" enough to take, and he still apparently\ncontinues to believe in the genuineness of the alleged occultphenomena.\nDigitized by Google\n\f312 Nr. Hodg8on's Report\nCONCLUSION.\nI may now draw attention to the main points involved in the fore-\ngoing inquiry.\nIn the first place, a large number of letters produced by M. and\nMadame Coulomb, formerly Librarian and Assistant Corresponding-\nSecretary respectively of the Theosophical Society, were, in the opinion-\nof the best expens in handwriting, written by Madame Blavatsky. These-\nletters, which extend over the years 1880-1883 inclusive, and some of\nwhich were published in the MadrtJIJ Christian College Magazine fol\"\nSeptember, 1884, prove that Madame Blavatsky has been engaged in.\nthe production of a varied and long-continued series of fraudulent\nphenomena, in which she has been assisted by the Coulombs. The\ncircumstantial evidence which I was able to obtain concerning the-\nincidents referred to in these letters, corroborates the judgment of the\nexperts in handwriting.\nIn the second place, apart altogether from either these letters or the\nstatements of the Coulombs, who themselves allege that they were\nconfederates of Madame Bla.vatsky, it appears from my own inquiries\nconcerning the existence and the powers of the supposed Adepts or\nMalwtmas, and the marvellous phenomena. a.1leged to have occurred in\nconnection with the Theosophical Society,\n1. Tha.t the primary witnesses to the existence of a Brother-\nhood with occult powers,-viz., Madame Blavatsky, Mr_\nDamodar K. Mavalankar, Mr. Bhavani Shankar, and Mr.\nBaba.jee D. Nath,- have in other matters deliberately made\nstatements which they must have known to be false, and that\ntherefore their asst'Irtions cannot establish the existence of tlla-\nBrotherhood in question.\n2. That the comparison of handwritings further tends to show that\nKoot Hoomi La! Sing and Mahatma. Morya are fictitious\npersonages, and that most of tho documents purporting to\nhave emanated from these \"personages,\" and especially from\n\" K. H.\" (Koot Hoomi Lal Sing), are in the disguised hand-\nwriting of Madame Blava.tsky herself, who originated the\nstyle of the K. H. handwriting; and that some of the\nK. H. writing is the handiwork of Mr. Damodar in\nimitation of the writing developed by Madame Bla.vatsky.\n3. That in no single phenomenon which came within the scope\nof my investigation in Indio., was the evidence such as would\nentitle it to be regarded as genuine, the witnesses for the most\npart being exceedingly inaccurate in observation or memory,\nand having neglected to exercise due care for the exclusion of\nfraud; while in the case of some of the witnesses there h8.8\nbeen much conscious exaggeration and culpable misstatement.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Phenomena connected fcitll Theosopll!l. 313\n4. Tbat not only was the evidence insufficient to establish the\ngenuineness of the a.lleged marvels, but that evidence furnished\npartly by my own inspection, and partly by a large number of\nwitnesses, most of them Theosophists, concerning the structure,\nposition, and environment of the Shrine, concerning \"Mahat-\nrna\" communications received independently of the Shrine,\nand concerning various other incidents, including many of the\nphenomena mentioned in \"The Occult World,\" besides the\nnumerous additional suspicious circumstances which I have\nnoted in the course of dealing in detail with the cases con-\nsidered, renders the conclusion unavoidable that the pheno-\nmena in question were actually due to fraudulent arrange-\nment.\nThe question whicb will now inevitably arise is-what has induced\nMadame Blavatsky to live so many laborious days in such a fantastic\nwork of imposture' And although I conceive that my instructions did\nnot require me to make this particular 'luestion a province of my\ninvestigation, and to explore the hidden motives of Madame Blavatsky,\nI should consider this Report to be incomplete unless I suggest what I\nmyself believe to be an adequate explanation of her ten years' toil on be-\nhalf of the Theosophical Society. It may be supposed by some who are\nunfamiliar with her deficiencies and capacities that the Theosophical\nSociety is but the a.loe-blossom of a woman's monomania, and that the\nstrange, wild, passionate, unconventional Madame Blavatsky has been\n\"finding her epos\" in the establishment of some incipient world-\nreligion. But a closer knowledge of her character would show such a\nsupposition to be quite untenable; not to speak of the positive\nqualities which she habitually manifested, there are certain varieties of\npersonal sacrifice and religious aspiration, the absence of which from\nMadame Blavatsky's conduct would alone suffice to remove her ineffably\nfar from the St. Theresa type.\nAs Madame Blavatsky in propria p~rl101U2, she can urge her\nfollowers to fraudulent impersonations; under the cloak of Koot\nHoomi she can incite \"her\" Chelas to dishonourable statements; and as\nan acc.omplished forger of other people's handwriting, she can strive to\nsave berself by blackening the reputation of her enemies. She is,\nindeed, a rare psychological study, almost as rare as a \"Mahatma\";\nshe was terrible exceedingly when she' expressed her overpowering\nthought that perhaps her \"twenty years'\" work might be spoiled\nthrough Madame Coulomb; and she developed a unique resentment\nfor the\" spiritualistic mediums,\" whose trickeries, she said, she\" could\nso easily expose,\" but who continued to draw their disciples, while\nher own more guarded and elaborate scheme was in danger of being\nturned inside out. Yet I must confess that the problem of her motives,\nx\nDigitized by Google\n\f314 MI'. Hodgson's Report\nwhen I found myself being forced to the conclusion that her\nclaims and her phenomena were fraudulent, caused me no ,little\nperplexity.\nIt appeared to me that, even should the assertions of Theosophists\nthat their Society has been partly dependent upon the gifts of Madame\nBlavatsky prove to be the reverse of truth, the sordid motive of\npecuniary gain would be a solution of the problem still less satisfactory\nthan the hypothesis of religious mania.. More might be said in support\nof the supposition that a morbid yearning for notoriety was the\ndominsnt emotion which has stimulated and sustained her energetic\nefforts in the singular channel which they have so long pursued. But\neven this hypothesis I was unable to adopt, and reconcile with my\nunderstanding of her character.\nAt last a casual conversation opened my eyes. I had taken no\ninterest in Central Asian perplexities, was entirely unaware of the\nalleged capacities of Russian intrigue, and had put aside as unworthy\nof consideration the idea-which for some time had currency in India-\nthat the objects of the Theosophical Society were political, and that\nMadame Blavatsky was a \"Russian spy.\" But a conversation with\nMadame Blavatsky, which arose out of her sudden and curious\nexcitement at the news of the recent Russian movement upon the\nAfghan frontier, compelled me to ask myself seriously whether it was\nnot possible that the task which she had set herself to perform in\nIndia was to foster and foment as widely as possible among the\nnatives a disaffection towards British rule.* Madame Blavatsky's\nmomentary emotional betrayal of her sympathies in the onset\nof her excitement was not rendered less significant by the\ntoo strongly-impressed \"afterstroke\" of a quite uncalled-for vitupera.-\ntion of the Russians, who, she said, \"would be the death-\nblow of the Society if they got into India.\" That she was ever seven\nyears in Thibet there is much reason for disbelieving. In a letter she\nwrote to a Hindu from America, she professed no more than that she\nhad acquired some occult knowledge from some wandering Siberian\nShamans, which, being interpreted, probably means, if her statement\nhas any foundation of truth at all, that she learnt their conjuring\nperformances. According to her own account, in one of the Blavatsky-\nCoulomb letters, it appears that before her acquaintance with Madame\nCoulomb at Cairo, in 1872, she had been filling a page which she wishes\n\u2022 There is a special rule in the Society providing for secret membel'l!hiJl.\nMadame Blavatsky's influence is felt, moreover, far beyond the limits of tbe\nSociety. When alle returned to India, at tbe end of last year, an addre88 of\nsympathy was presented to her by a large body of native students of Madras,\nof whom, apparently, only two or tbree were Theosopbists.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Pllellomena cOlUlected ,ritl, Theosoph!l. 315\nto be \"torn out of the book \"* of her life. This part of her history\ndoes not at present concern us, except that it proves the stary of her\nThibetan experiences to be fabulous. But the letter also refers to her\nsojourn at Cairo and her later adventures, and it appears that she and\na certain Madame Sebire bad eatablished a Society in Cairo, which was\nevidently\" spiritualistic,\" and which failed; that shortly after parting\nwith Madame Coulomb in Cairo, she went to Odessa, taking Madame\nSebire, who dragged her into an enterprise of \"making some extra-\nordinary inks,\" which proved a losing speculation; that from Odessa\nshe proceeded to India, where \"she remained over eight months, and\nthen returning by Odessa to Europe, went to Paris, and thence\nproceeded to America,\" where the Theosophical Society was established.\nThe same letter contains the following explanation to Madame\nCoulomb, clearly in order that the latter might understand that the\nnew Society was on a different basis from that which Madame Blavatsky\nhad countenanced, in 1872, in Egypt.\n\"We believe in nothing 81tpernat1.\u00a3'ral, and discard eyery miracle--those\nof the Jewish Bible especially. But we are believers in and students of\nphenomena, though we do not attribute every manifestation to 'spirits' of\ndisembodied people sololy, for we have found out that the spil\"it of the livillg\nfllan was far more powerful than the spirit of a dead person.

But I hope\nyou will answer me frankly, dear Mrs. Coulomb, and say what you think of\nit. And thus we may be able to elucidate more than one mystery before we\nmeot each other again.\"\nIt seems, then, that Madame Blavatsky, a. Russian lady, the\ndaughter of Colonel Hahn (of the Russian Horse Artillery), and\nquondam widow of General Blavatsky (Governor during the Crimean\n'Va.r, and for many years, of Erivan ill Armenia), assisted in starting\na. spiritualistic Society in Egypt, which failed; that she afterwards\nspent eight months in India., and' then. proceeded to America. for wha.t\n*Tllat thilllife-page was partly known to)Iadame Coulomb,and thaUIadame\nBlavatsky feared her in consequence, is bome out by the fact that, in a dispute\nwhich afOlle, in 1880, while Madame Blavo.tsky was at Ce~lon, between Madame\n('oulomb andanothermember of the Society at its headquarters, then in Bombay,\nlIatlame Coulomb boasted of her power. Her boast was apparently jUlltified\nupon lIadame Blavatsky's return. Madame Coulomb was supported by Madame\nntavataky, and therefore also by Colonel Olcott, and the dispute resulted in the\nwithdrawal from the Society of some of the most inJIuentialmembers at Bombay.\nwho regarded the action taken in the matter by the founders as wanting in\ntltraighUorwal'tlnlll'lI. I have had personal intef\\ieW8 with 80me of these ex-\nmembefll, who consider that the recent exposures of tile Coulombs lIave thrown\nlIlucllligllt on tile formerly mysterious behaviour of Madame Bla\"atl!ky and\nlladame Coulomb in connection with the Bombay episode.\nx 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f316 MI'.

She apparently\nmade the mistake in the first instance, of adopting CI an attitude of\nobtrusive sympathy with the natives of the soil as compared with the\nEuropea.ns,\" as Mr. Sinnett tells us (\" The Occult World,\" p. 25) j but\nahe soon remedied this error by obtaining the public adhesion to her\nfollowing of such men as Mr. A. 0, Hume (see p. 273) and Mr. Sinnett.\nAnd without attempting to show in detail how strongly the patriotic\nfeeling of the natives has been enlisted in connection with the\nTheosophical Society, or how well the procedure of Madame\nB~vatsky may be shown to comport with the view that her ultimate\nobject has been the ful'therance of Russian interests, I may quote\nseveral passages which, I think, suggest meanings which Madame\nBlavatsky would hardly dare to blazon on the banner of the Theosophical\nSociety. Thus Colonel Olcott wrote, and apparently italicised the\nsentence, in a letter from New York to a Hindu, in 18i8:-\n\"Whik 100 lmlX! flO political duigra8, yo\" una need no hiut to tmderlltatad\nthat our 8!Jmpatllie8 are tL-ith all tllollt tollo are deprired of the rigJlt ofgotremitl9\ntheir Otol~ lands for themBelves.

The above passages are from documents which came into\nmy hands quite independently of the Coulombs. Indeed, I am not\naware that the Coulombs even know of their existence. The\nfollowing passage is from a fragmentary script which forms one of\nthe Blavatsky-Coulomb documents; on one side of the paper are written\na few broken lines in Russian, the full significance of which is dubious\nwithout their context, and on the other side are written these words :-\nmilitary men, more than any other, must remember that tile approachlng\nact of the Eaatem dra.ma is to be the last and the decish'e one.

Be this as it may, I\ncannot profess myself, after my personal experiences of Madame\nBla.vatsky, to feel much doubt that her real object has been the\nfurtherance of Russian interests. But although I have felt bound to\nrefer to my own view on this point, I suggest it here only\nas a supposition which appears best to cover the known incidents\nof her career during the past 13 or 14 years. That she is a\nremarkably able woman will scarcely be questioned by any save\nthose of her followers whose very infatuation of beliE'f in her \"occult\nrelations\" is perhaps the most conspicuous proof of that ability\nwhich they deny; and it would be no venturesome prognostication to\nsay that, in spite of recent exposures, she will still retain a goodly\ngathering of disciples on whom she may continue to inculcate the ethics\nof a profound obedience to the behests of imaginary Mahatmas. The\nresources of Madame Blavatsky are great; and by the means of forged\nletters, fraudulent statements of Ohelas, and other false evidence,\ntogether with the hypothesis of Black Magicians, she may yet do much\nin the future for the benefit of human credulity.

Hodgsoll's Report\nAPPENDIX I.\nTHE SASSOON TELEGRAM (ride p. UiJ. ct-c.\nSome of the details which follow, and which seM'e to explain the\nextract quoted on p. 21I, I have learnt from the oral statements of\nMessrs. A. D. and M. D. Ezekiel, and the written statements of Mr.\nKhandalvala shown to me by Dr. Hartmann.\nMadame Blavatsky, on her way from Bombay to Madras, in Octo-\nber, 1883, stayed at Poona several days at the house of Mr. N. D.\nKhandalvala, a member of the Theosophical Society. On October 23rd\nshe dined at the house of Mr. Jacob Sassoon, who was desirous of seeing\nsome\" phenomenon.\" Madame Blayatsky despatched the letter from\nwhich the extract is taken, to Madame Coulomb on the moming\nof the 24th. While driving with Mr. A. D. Ezekiel on the afternoon of\nthe 24th, she expressed her desire to call upon Mr. Bassoon. Probably she\nintended, when she wrote to Madame Coulomb, to arrange for a con-\nversation with Mr. Bassoon on the afternoon of the 26th, when the sub-\nject of the telegram would be mentioned-only, of course, after much\nentreaty by 1tIr. Bassoon for some phenomenon j but, finding that llr.\nBassoon purposed leaving Poona on the 25th, she was compelled, if she\nwas to impress him at all, to take the needful action earlier than she\nbad anticipated. On this afternoon, then, of tbe 24th, after refusing\nto show Mr. Bassoon any phenomena, she professed, by some\"occult\"\nmental process, to get the opinion of Ramalinga's Master j but, having\nimperfectly heard his answer, she wished mentally, as she said, that\nRamalinga should communicate to her the words in writing, that she\nmight satisfy herself that she had heard aright. She wrote down at the\ntime the words she expected to receive, and said that Ramalinga would\nsend a telegram to her at once, or that she might not receive it tillaftel\"\na day or two. The telegram did not arrive till the 26th. Madame\nBlavatsky's explanation of the delay is that Ramalinga sent on the\nwords late to 1\\11'. Babajee D. Nath, who copied them and gave them to\nMadame Coulomb to be sent by telegram. This explanation was given\nto me by Madame Blavatsky, and appears also in the letter professedly\nwritten by her on October 26th to Colonel Olcott. Madame Blavatsky\nwas too shrewd openly to lay stress upon the telegram, but I have no\ndoubt, after conversations with Messrs. A. D. and M. D. Ezekiel,who were\npresent at Mr. Bassoon's on the 24th, and at Madame Blavatsky's receipt\nof the telegram on the 26th, that she wished the occurrence to\nbe regarded as \"phenomenal,\" notwithstanding Mr. A. D. Ezekiel's\nstatement to the contrary in his letter to the TinWl ofI1ldia.\nIt may be pointed out in passing that Mr. Babajee D. Nath lends\nhis sanction to 1tIadame Blavatsky's explanation, and thus, the\nDigitized by Google\n\f01' Phenomena com,ected fcifh Tlteosopl'l\/. 319\n.\nBlavatsky-Ooulomb letters being genuine, implicates himself in the\nfraud.\nThe statement made by Madame Blavatsky when the September\nnumber of the Cltristian College Hagazine appeared in Europe is as\nfollows :-\nTho third letter, supposed to be written lrom Poona, is an entire\nfabrication. I remember tho letter I wrote to her from Poona. It asked\nher to send me immediately the telegram contained in a note from Ramalinga\nif he brought or sent her one. I wrote to Colonel Olcott about the experi-\nment. He thinks he can find my letwr at Madras. I hope to either get\nback Ramalinga's note to me or obtain a statement of the whole matterfrom\nhim. How could 1 make a mistake in writing, however hurriedly, about\nthe name of one of my best friends? The forgers make me addre88 him-\n\"care of H. Khandalawalla \"-when there is no such man. The real name\nis N. D. Khandalawalla. .\nNow, in the first place, the H originally printed in the Christian\nCollege Magazine was a misprint or a miscopy for the N in the\noriginal document.\nAs for the letter supposed to have been written to Oolonel Olcott,\nit proves nothing, even were it written at the time it professes to have\nbeen written, viz., October 26th, 1883. Colonel Olcott alleges that he\nfound this letter among his papers at Madras on his return thither at\nthe end of last year, though he was unable to tell me how, when, or\nwhere he had originally received it. I was afterwards informed by Mr.\nDamodar that Madame Blavatsky had sent it through him to Colonel\nOlcott, whom he was accompanying on his tour in 1883. My opinion\nis tllat this letter, which was shown to me, is e:x; post jacto, and\nwas not written earlier than towards the end of last year. There\nare two statements in the letter which appear to me to point to\nits having been written at the later date. One of these is Madame\nBlavatsky's expression of her deep distrus~ of the Coulombs; the\nother is the following :-Madame Blavatsky, after writing that\nRamalinga objected to give the words to :Madame Coulomb, and gave\nthem to Babajee, who gave them to lfadame Coulomb to be sent as a\ntelegram, continues: \"I received the telegram to-day, but as it said,\nC Master hasjust heard your conversation '-when it was not 'just now'\nbut yesterday that the conversation took place-it was a glorious\nJailure \/\" Now the letter is dated October 26th, therefore\" y{lSterday\"\nwould be Ootober 25th. But the conversation took place on Ootober\n24th. If the letter was written a year after the events, the mistake is\nintelligible enough. It was probably concocted after the appearance of\nthe Christian College Magazine in Eul'ope, and then-if we are to regard\nColonel Olcott as a dupe in the matter-sent to Mr. Damodar for\ninsertion among Colonel Olcott's papers.\nDigitized by Google\n\f820 Appeudiccs to MI'. Hodgson's Beport\nI have also seen the letter alleged to ha,;e been written by\nRamalinga at the time, and it appeared to me to be written, in part at\nleast, in the disguised hand of Madame Blavatsky. It is curious, too,\nthat in this letter Rama.tinga. is represented as expressing a great dread\nof Madame Coulomb; and I may say here tha.t my inquiries have not\nenabled me to discover that Mr. Ramalinga Deb's existence has ever\nbeen other than imaginary.\nBut a more serious flaw in the attempted explanation by Madame\nBlavatsky yet remains. Messrs. Khandalvala and Ezekiel main-\ntain that Madame Blavatsky could not have written to Madame\nCoulomb on the 24th after the conversation took place at lIr.\nBassoon's in time for her letter to reach Madame Coulomb on the'\n26th. Bhe declo.res in her statement that she asked Madame Coulomb\nto send her \"immediately the telegram contained in a note from\nRamalinga. if he brought or sent her one,\" and from her sup-\nposed letter to Colonel Olcott it appears that this expected telegram\nrelated to the Bassoon conversation. Hence this alleged request must\nhave been made before the aforesaid conversation occurred; and it is\napparently not denied by Madame Blavatsky that she did write to\nMadanae Coulomb on the lIuwning of the 24th. On Madame Blavatsky's\nown showing, therefore-if Messrs. Ezekiel and Khandalva.la are right\nconcerning the time of the conversation and the subsequent events\nwhich prevented her afterwards writing a letter-a specific pre-arrange-\nment must have been made by her for a conversation, the whole point\nof which was that its subject should have arisen extempore.\nI may here notice some of Madame Blavatsky's allegations concerning\nother extracts which I have quoted. These allegations, among others, were\npublished in a pamphlet issued in 1884, by the Council of the London\nLodge of the Theosophical Society. AgaiU8t extract (9), p. 213, she said:\n\" There is no 'Maharajah of Lahore,' hence I could not have spoken of such\na person, nor have been attempting mock phenomena for his deception.\" I\ndo not suppose that anyone who is familiar with Madame Blavatsky would\nmaintain that she could not have written le8 Maharajah de Lahore u\" de\nBenaru simply because there was no Maharajah of Lahore but only of\nBenares.\nConcerning extract (7), p. 213, Madame Blavatsky said: \"All depends\nupon knowing who is ' Christopholo '-a little ridiculous figure ill rags, about\nthree inches high ; she wrote to say it had accidentally been destroyed. She\njoked over it, and I too.\" In reference to another extract (H)-where\n\" Christofolo\" occurred, she said: '\" Christopholo ' was a ruune by which\nshe [Madame Coulomb] called an absurd little figure, or image of hers. She\ngave nicknames to everything.\" And in B. Replies Bhe wrote a propo. of\nextract (7) (which occurs at the end of a letter about her intended movements\nfor the next few months, and other practical matters), \"I deny having\nwritten any such thing on that same letter. I remember her telling mo in a\nDigitized by Google\n\f011 Phenomena connected trith 1'Mo8op\"lI. 321\nletter her magic Christopholo 100 melted in the sun, and I may have answered .\nher BOmething to that effect. But that after the serious letter that precedes\nI should write such oo.A is impoBBible, not ill mYlltyle at all.\"\nConcerning extract (13), p. 215, she wrote : .. I could never, in writing to\nher who saw the man every day, use all his names and titles. I should\nsimply have said, 'Dewan Bahadur,' withl\\ut adding 'Rajanath Rao, the\nPresident of the Society,' as if introducing to her one she did not know.\nThe whole name is evidently put in now to make it clear who is meant.\" Now\nI think. it is probably true that Madame Blavatsky would not usually write\nthe full name and titles of Mr. Ragoonath Rao, and I account for her having\nwritten them in the present case by supposing that she had just written\nthem in the K. H. hand on the envelope of the Mahatma document\nshe had prepared, and that they were consequently running in her mind.\nAPPENDIX II..\nTHE ADYAR SAUCER (lee p. 118).\nThe subjoined account is that of l\\:fajor-General Morgan himself,*\nwho thinks it sufficiently proves that Madame Blavatsky could not\nhave written letter No.4 (p. 212)! It should be compared with his\nearlier accoWlt, quoted on p. 218.\nIn the month of August, 1883, I was obliged to go to Madras on\nbusineBB entirely unconnected with Adyar aft'airs. Madame Blavatsky was\nthen staying in my hOU4C, and urged me to stay at the Adyar during my visit\nto Madras. This I declined, as the place was too flU\" from my busineBB. She\nthen advised me to see the picture of the Mahatma in the Shrine, as it was a\nvery peculiar work. I replied that I should make a point of going to see the\npicture, but the day was not mentioned. Two or three days after my arrival\nat Madras I went to visit the headquarters, and found that the woman\nCoulomb was out, and was requested by Damodar to await her return. She\ncame in about one hour, baving been out shopping in Madras.

I Wall not then\naware, as I am now, of the fact that the astral electric current causes a sound\nexactly like that of the ordinary telegraph to be distinctly heard in the\nShrine; unaware of this, I resumed conversation with the Coulombs regard-\ning the accidellt, when I remarked that it would be well if he gotsome mastic\nor glue and tried to put the pieces together. On my saying this he started\nto get some, which he said he had in his bungalow, situated about 100 yards\nfrom the house, and I, turning to his wife, remarked, .. If tho matter is of\nsufficient importance the Mahatmas could cause its repair, if not you must\ndo the best you can.\" Hardly had I uttered this,*when Damodar said,\n.. There is a message,\" and he immediately opened the door of the Shrine and\ntook down the silver bowl (in which the letters are generally found), and sure\nenough there was a note, which on opening contained the following lines :-\n\"To the small audience present as witnesses. Now Madame Coulomb\nhas occasion to assure herself that the devil is neither as black nor as wicked\nas he is generslly represented. The mischief is easily repaired.-K.H.\"\nWe then opened the cloth containing the broken saucer, found it intact and\nwhole! Threet minutes had not elapsed since I had suggested the glue should\nbe procured! and shortly after Coulomb returned with the glue in his\nhand. If he could have gone all round the upper roollll, got behind the\nShrine, removed the broken saucer, tied up the parcel, having placed a\nwhole one in its stead, and written the note regarding the repair of the\nsaucer (my remark about which he had not heard), then I say his feat rivalled\nthat of the Masters! When I spoke to tho woman about the wonde11ul\nmanner in which the saucer had been restored, she replied, \"It must bo the\nwork of the devil.\" Here is her note on tho subject, written to Madame\nBlavatsky, then in Ootacamund.

Fh'e minutes had scarcely\nelapsed after this remark.\" This five \",inlites exhibits here a decided tendency\nto approximate to nothing.-R.H.\nt According to the earlier account this interval was considerably longer,\nbeing five miuutes, together with an uncertain interval spent partly in con-\nversation, partly in reading the note, &c.

The letter disappeared. It was afterwards returned to him with\nt.he seal apparently unbroken, and it contained the handwriting of a IID.-\nhatma in reply to his letter. Mr. G. was not completely satisfied that the\nletter might not have been taken out from the back of the Shrine and the\nletter opened without destroying the seal. Madame Blavataky hearing of\nthis, wished all doubts to be removed, and hence ordered the wall to be\nblocked up and covered with chunam.\nAfter this work was completed it was suggested by M. Coulomb that a\nsheH and sideboard should be made for the room adjoining the Occult Room\n88 a resting place for the dishes which might be passed through the upper\npart of a closed door i88uing from this adjoining room to the terrace. This\nproposal was madeto save the servants' pa88ing through the drawing-room with\nthe dishes, as this adjoining l\"OOm was at that time used byMadame Blavatsky\n.88 her dining-room. This suggestion was welcomed by MadameBlavatsky, who\nordered M. 'Coulomb to make the sideboard\" at once-at once.\" This Bide-\nboard was made and placed against the wall opposite to the Shrine. Whether\nit contained drawera or was opened by a door Mrs. Morgan is unable to\nrecollect. This sideboard remained in that place during the time of the\nanniversary. It was about three feet high.

Madame Blavatsky herself asked me on several occasions\nto examine, as she knew my relation to the gentleman. I was also present\non the day when Mr. Coulomb gave the charge of the upstairs to our party\nand when he exposed himself audaciously. I remember very well that, during\nthe last (VIII.)anniversary, lone day tapped well on the papered wall behind\nthe Shrine in various plaeea, and found, from the noise produced, that it\nwas a whole wall. I have tapped on the wall after Coulomb's contrivances,\nand found that there is a marked dift'erence between the portion of the\nwall where he has cut open and between other portions of it. Th~ former\nwhen tapped produces now the noise of a hollow, incomplete wall; while\nthe latter portion stands the test of tapp~. I know more of the\nphenomena, of Madame Blavatsky, and of the Coulombs than any outsider;\nI am in so iutimate relations at the headquarters that I have been treated\nwith matters of a confidential nature unreservedly. Even Madame Coulomb\nherself had been along treating me as a real friend, and telling much and\noften of what she said she would not tell others. I have, therefore, no\nhesitation at all in stating for a fact that any contrivances whatever, like\ntrap-doors, &c., that are now found had nothing at all to do with Madame\nBlavatsky, who had not the remotest idea of them. The Coulombs are the\ny\nDigitized by Google\n\f330 AppelUiice8 to MI'. HOOg801,'8 Report\nsole authors of the lliot. It is worth mentioning here that Mr. Coulomb\nworked up the walls, set up the doors, and did everything without allowing\"\na single carpenter, m&80n, or coolie, to go upstairs i and he W&8 furious if\nany of us went up to see. To prove that Madame Blavataky W&8 not a party\nto the scheme, I shall cite one fact. She allowed-nay, requested-1tlr. G.\nSubbiah Chetty Garu, F.T.S., to examine the work done. He went one day\nto see it. Coulomb W&8 furious, and did not allow him, but drove him out.\nand told Madame Blavataky that none of us should go there at all, since he\nlI&id he W&8 working without clothes alone. This W&8 a mere Pl'etext, &8 on\nthat occaaion he W&8 not so,*and as we have all seen him often with only a\npair of dirty trousers. Instances can be multiplied. I must conclude by\nlI&ying that the \"phenomena\" of the Mahatmas do not stand in need of\nCoulombian contrivances, &8 I have witnessed at different times and different\nplaces when and where there were no such trsp-doors, and I have seen and\nknow those exalted sages who are the authors of the \"phenomena.\" I can\ntherefore &88ure all my friends that the Coulombs had got Ull a \"Christian\nplot\" during Madame Blavataky's absence.\nII~ \"eply to my quMWIIS :-He had seen the boarding on the eaat side of\nthe Occult Room wall behind the Shrine i said it was not at alllike the four-\npanelled door now ill t.he north side of the sitting-roum.

Her explicit\ntestimony that it was placed in its position before the anniversary, and\nremained there during the anniversary, is confirmed by the statements of\nDr. Hartmann, Me88rB. Subba Row, P.

As to the four-panelled boarding in the side of Madame\nBlavatsky's sitting-room, Ananda and even Babula stated that it was that\nwhich had previously been at the back of the receu behind the Sllrine, and\nMr. Subba Row stated that it ,\u00b7uembled that boarding. The reason men-\ntioned by Mrs. Morgan, Mr. Subba Row, and Ananda for the removal of\ntile boarding from its original position in the rece88 behind the Shrine,\nagrees with that alleged by Madame Coulomb (\" Some A.ccount,\" &c., p.71),\nTi:., that Madame Blavatsky had \"heard that some one had hinted at tho\nexistence of sliding panels in this malBive sham door, which was at the back\nof the bricked-up window against which the Sbrine leant.\" Against this\nstatement, in my copy of Madame Coulomb's pamphlet, Madame Blavataky\nbas written the word \u2022\u2022NEVER\"! In reply to my very definite questioning\nas to the full significance of this word, Madame Blavataky &88ert-eti that no\none lU\\d hinted at panels, and that there never had been a boardirlt.

[The hollow of the receaa Babula was\nnot sure about; he appeared to be trying to get some cue from Babajee, who\nwas present; said first it had been filled up, but finally said he did not know,\nbut thinks it was filled up.] The sideboard was put against the wall for the\n.first time about the beginning of February. He saw the wall papered over\nsome time before the anniversary.\n[See comments on Mr. Babajee's evidence.]\nMR. P. RATHNAVELU (Editor of The Philosophic Inquirer), Madras.\n[He visited Adyar on 14th September, 1884, to inspect the rooms, &c.\nDr. Hartmann, Mr. Judge, and Mr. Damodar led him to the Shrine.]\nFrom 1\\ letter to the Editor of The T1wJsophist, 21st September, 1884.\nI examined it [the Shrine] carefully and with a critical eye of course some-\ntimes touching the several parts thereof with my own hand, to guard myself\nagainst any poBBible illusion ofthe sight. There was no opening or hole on this\nside of the cupboard (!;;hrine) forany one to reach his hand from behind it. It\nwas rather loosely but firmly fixed to the wall, so that one could paBB a stick\nthrough the space between the back board of the Shrine and the wall to\nwhich it is attached. On being satisfied with this portion of the Shrine, I\nwas led into the adjoining room to see the other side of the wall to which\nthe Shrine is attached, aml which is alleged to be connected with it by a trap-\ndoor or back door. Alas! I was shown an ingenious piece of furniture-\nlike apparatus, standing close to, or I might say even fixed to the mouth of\nthe Shrine, to which was fastened a sliding door which, when opened, led\ninto a small aperture in that wall nearly two by three feet. Inside of this\nagain there was a hollow space, sufficiently large for a lean lad to stand 011\nhis legs, if he could but creep into it through the aperture, and hold his\nbreath for a few seconds. I attempted in vain to creep through the opening\nin the wall myself, and simply stretched out my head with some difficulty\ninto the small hollow to see its internal condition and structure. It had no\ncommunication with the back board of the Shrine. At least there was\nnothing in it to show that there could have been any such thing. From\nwhich and other circumstances I thought within myself that the diabolical\nmachinery, for the invention of which the Society is greatly indebted to the\ngenius of Mr. Coulomb, the \"Engineer-in-Chief of the Devil,\" was not\nfinished, as was intended. I was shown also other similar inventions-such\nas sliding panels, sliding doors, &c., by the lIelfsame gentleman; all of which\nbore the stamp of the freshneBB of unfinished work.\n. . . . . ~\nWhen I had seen the Shrine and its surroundings on a previous occasion,\nas stated already, on the 1st April, 1883, there was a large a1mirah lltanding\nagainst the wall, just on the very spot where Mr. Coulomb has been pleased\nto put up his machinery trap-door ; and it was, if I remember aright, in the\nDigitized by Goo\n\fOn Pltentmtena. cotlflected UJith Tlte08opnv. 333\nbedroom of Madame Blavataky. On the occurrence of the phenomenon\nrecorded in TM Philolophic Inquirer of the 8th April, 1883, which waa\nntlither pre-arranged nor premeditated, aa will be seen from my report in that\njournal, I took great care to see that there 11'88 no trap-door or opening\nbehind the Shrine on either aide of the wall to which it ia fixed. The\nalmirah 11'114, at our request to Madame Blavataky, removed with lOme\ndifficulty from ita place, to allow of the wall on that aide being tapped and\naufficiently examined by me. I did 10, and waa then convinced thoroughly\nthat there 11'88 no attempt at deception on any one'a part.\n[Said he had not heard from Mr. Damodar that I waa coming.]\nIII n~ply to myqtwfiom :-Mr. Rathnavelu inspected the Shrine in April,\n1883. He did not move the Shrine from the wall. There was mualin\nbetween the Shrino and the wall, and there 11'88 just apace enough to paaa a\nstick up and down between the Shrine and the muslin, the Shrine being\nabout an inch from the wall. He paaaed the stick up and down in this man-\nner, and it moved freely. When the almirah or cupboard in the room\nadjoining the Occult Room waa removed, there 11'88 viaible a plaatered wall,\nwhich lOunded hollow. The plaater covered IOmo planking.\n[At first I understood that Mr. Rathnavelu clearly admitted that the\nplanking, or blocking door, waa visible behind the almirah, but he then\nstated, on my repeating the inquiry very definitely, that this blocking door\nwaa covered with chunam. On my aaking how he knew there was a door\nunderneath, he said he had been told 10 at the time.]\nMr. Rathnavelu also stated that he waa present at the anniversary, 27th\nDecember, in 1883, and admitted that the sideboard was then present\nagainst the waUl of the room adjoining the OccultRoom.\n[The marks of the naila used to keep the plank door in ita place are\nstill viaible in the receaa on the east aide of the wall, and it appears clearly\nthat the door waa never covered with chunam.

Ru.umuroAB (native doctor).\n[Extract from an account quoted in the Supplement to TM ThwIophilt for\nNovember, 1884.]\nI have known the Shrine at Adyar since Febuary, 1883. But it waa in\nSeptember, 1883, that I had actually an opportunity of closely examining\nthe structure of the Shrine, 10 aa to see whether the trickery, now pretended\nto be exposed, had ever any existence. I may say that I entered the room\ncontaining the Shrine with the mind of an out-and-out aceptic, indeed, all\nthia time, I may say 111'88 an unbeliever, though I had constantly met the\nfounders of the Theosophical Societ.y, and read much of their writing.\nWhat atruck me about the doings of the Th8OlOphiata was, CC What neceuity\nia there for these modern Theoaophista to perform their phenomena in a\nparticular locality, and that in ashrine, while our ancient aages did all we\nhave known in open places' \" I 11'88 BOOn quieted by an invitation on the\npart of Madame Blavataky to inspect the Shrine, and satisfy myaelf about\nit. .-\nI ahall now give a brief description of the Shrine and ita situation in\norder that\u00b7 the outside public may see whether it is poaaible that the en-\nDigitized by Google\n\f334 Appelldices to MI'. Hodg80n'8 Report\nlightened members of the Society could have been subjected to t.he trickery\nthat the Coulombs now boast of exposing.\nMadame Blavatsky had her sleeping apartment in the hall upstairs in the\nAdyar premises. There is a door-way leading from this hall to a room where\nthe Shrine is suspended, the Shrine itself (a cupboard as they call it) being\non the wall aboutfour feet above the ground. I opened the doors of this Shrine,\nand fOWld in it some photos and a silver cup and a few other things. I\nclearly eumined every portion of this Shrine from within, tapping with my\nhanda every part cf it, and nowhere could I find room for suspicion. Not\nsatisfied with this, I examined the outside of the Shrine, the front and the\nsidel, and the top ; and they ltood the telt. For fear of disarranging the\nthings, I did not move the Shrine about, but what was more satisfactory, I\nexamined the back portion of the wall on which rested the Shrine (which\nwas inside the hall containing Madame Blavatsky'l sleeping apartment) and\nfound that there could not be the slightest room for sUlpicion in any\ndirection, so far as the matter of the structure of the Shrine is concerned.\nAfter this Madame Blavatsky had the kindness to ask if any of 01 (we\nwerethen about five there) had any letter to send to Mahatmas. One of\n01 immediately produced a letter; I took up the cup from the Shrine, having\ncarefully examined it,and the gentleman dropped the letter into it. I placed\nthe cup with the letterin the Shrine, and closed it, as desired by the above\nlady. Two or three minutes after, Madame Blavatsky, who was standing\nabout two yards oft' from the Shrine, said she felt an answer came, and on\nopening the Shrine we found a letter addre88ed to the sender, containing four\npages with not le88 than 20 lines on each, which would occupy any mortal\nwriter, simply to copy it in, not le88 than half-an-hour. It must be remem-\nbered that there mOlt have been time for one to read the letter, and then to\nprepare an answer which may take up another 15 minutes. But all this\ntook place in the course of two or three minutes.\nI shall now give an acC(lunt of the so-called trap-door. I found this trap-\ndoor in an incomplete state for the first time in June, 1884, a few months\nafter the departure of the founders. It is so small a door that a thin, spare\nboy of 10 or 12 years could hardly enter through it. It is intended to\nbe understood the phenomenal letters were ushered into the Shrine through\nthis passage, but anyone seeing the passage for himself would be convinced\nof the imp088ibility of the thing being done.\nI must, therefore, take this occasion to represent what I know of these\nmatters to allow Truth to triumph; and I feel it specially neoo88&ry now\nthat every one of 01 should speak out h.is experience of the Theosophists and\ntheir doings, that they may fumish, however lightly it may be, answers to\nthe attacks of tlle Coulombs upon the conduct of persona too far away to\njustify themselves.\nIn reply to my qlltstio1l1 :--He had not removed the Shrine from the wall,\nnor had he examined the back of the Shrine from without or the face of\nthe wall juxtaposed. The wall he examined was in the other room, and\nwas bare and intact where it corresponded to the Shrine.\nThe letter produced was one which had been previously forwarded to\nMr. Damodar to be sent to the Mahatma, and Mr. Damodar placed it in the\nShrine.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Pl,enomena cOllneeted rcit\" 1'he08Op!l!l. 335\n[The statementa of Mr. Rajamiengar are curiously wide of the truth.\nHe (leacribes the wall behind the Shrine in Madame Blavataky's bedroom as\n\"bare and intact\" in September, 1883, whereas at that time the four-\npanelled boarding was certainly there. Mr. P.

Colonel Olcott declared that he had\nentirely forgotten the circumstances to which this note referred until finding\nit in his drawer. It ran as follows :-\n\"Henry, now that your fever is cured I want you perform something\nthat will cure it for ever. It would not do for you to have it at Ceylon.\nCall Babula and a cooly or two and lifting off the cupboard Shrine clean off\nthe wall (you can do so without taking it off ita wires or nail), write my sign\n-on that spot of the wall which corresponds with the centre and four corners\n.of the cupboard. The signs must be very small, and thus. [The letter con-\ntained a rough sketch of the positions of the marks.] When you return from\nCeylon the answers will be there. Copy them. You must not let tTpasika\naee what you have done, nor tell her. Especially keep this secret from the\nCoulombs.\"\nColonel Olcott then told me that the finding of this letter had recalled to\nhis mind the fact that he obeyed these instructions. He calculated the date\nto be December 17th, 1883. He declares that he looked again on a date\n-calculated by him to be February 13th, 1884, and found the wall in the same\ncf'lDdition as on December 17th. There was no mention of these eventa in\nhis diary. Colonel Olcott said there was muslin behind the Shrine, and\nBabula,-who was summoned by Madame Blavataky, !lot at my request,-\n:&aid that he remembered the incident, and that he moved the Shrine, &0.,\nvery carefully, because he was afraid Madame Blavataky would be angry.\nColonel Olcott, in reply to my inquiry made at the time when t,his note was\nfirst shown me, said that he thougbt he must have observed any panel or hollow\nif there had been such behind the muslin, which he said was moved at the\ndifferent positions BO as to allow him to write the initials. Colonel Olcott's\n.confidence, however, soon increased considerably, and in a later conversation\nhe aSBerted that he saw the whole bare wall at once after removing the\n.., stuff\" between it and the Shrine! The reader however may remember\nthat to see the whole bare wall at once it would have been needful to\nremove not only the muslin but the other fabric, which, according to the\nevidence of Mr. Lane-Fox, closely covered the wall immel\\iately behind the\nShrine.\nDigitized by Google\n\f336 Appendice8 to HI'. Ho\u00abg30n'3 Report\nExamination of Colonel Olcott's testimon1 in other cases (see Report,\npp. 231-239, analysis of his evidence given before the Committee), even with-\nout the discrepancy noted above, is enough to show the impossibility of\nplacing any reliance upon his isolated\" remembered\" indirect observation of\nthe wall behind the Shrine.\nMost probably this Mahatma note is an e:I: p<J8t jacto document foisted\nupon Colonel Olcott by Madame Blavatsky. Had it really been written at\nthe close of 1883, it should have been mentioned in Colonel Olcott's detailed\ndiary, and it should have been found by Colonel Olcott immediately on bis\narrival at Adyar from Europe at the end of 1884, when he professes to bave\nmade a careful search through his papers for documents of value as against\nthe Coulombs' charges; nothing, however, was heard of it till the moment\nwhen evidence for inspection of the Shrine wall was known to be lacking.\nMR. DAMODAR K. 1\\1AVALANKAl!..\nA1lfI1Ut 18th, 1884.\nFrom hisji,.,t reply to Cil'Clda,. inquiry:-As regards the hole [through the\nsideboard into the rece&II] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 in the presence of Dr. Hartmann and\nMr. Lane-Fox, I attempted to enter it. All who know me or have seen\nme areaware how thin and lean I am ; and although I was almost half naked at\nthe time, I could enter the \"hole\" with difficulty. And when once inside I\ncould only stand abreast without being able to move, either way, an inch, or\nto lift up my band. I was there hardly 10 seconds when I felt choked,\nand I am firmly persuaded to believe that if I had stopped there two minutes\nlonger I should have fainted on account of suft'ocation. And this when the\ncupboard attached to the hole was removed, and there was passage for air\nthrough it. How much more suft'ocating must it be when there is no such\nfree passage for air 1 Moreover, the piece of wall f)n which the \"Shrine\"\nwas hung is intact. Mr. Coulomb himself told us, on the evening of the 18th,\nthat there was no communication then between that \" wall\" and the\n\" Shrine.\" The frame of the \"Shrine\" was also intact, and there was no\nsliding panel to it. All this he himself admitted, adding, however, that he\nhad closed them up before Madame Blavatsky's departure from Madras. If\n80, there are several witne88es to show that the phenomena were witnessed\neven in the\" Shrine\" afteJ' Madame BlamtBky'8 deparltwe, and when, accord-\ning to Mr. Coulomb's own admission, the communication between the\n\" Shrine\" and the aperture was no longer existing.\nAuguat 19th, 1884.\nFrom his 86coml reply to cil'cular illquiry:-1 had not tnyaelj examined the\nwall, nor the Shrine for some time; but I was present on several occasions\nwhen the various witnesses to the \"occult phenomena\" had examined them.\nOne or two of these were themselves engineers, and had closely and minutely\nexamined the places. They luul scrutinised carefully, in every p088ible way,\nthe Shrine, and had satisfied themselves that it was intact, and had no lxUleiB\nor anything of the kind. I say all this because the several examinations in\nmypresence were completely satisfactory, and I had no reason to complain\nin any way. When some outsiders had made unfavourable observations, I\nmean these who had never been in the OCCltlt Room, Madame Blavataky\nhad asked me to examine the Shrine; and one day, in December or January\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Pkellome'lla conllected tnth Tke08opl'!I. 331\nlast, I well remember Mr. Subba Rowand myself very carefully examining\nthe Slu'i1l6 and the waU ; and we were both satisfied that they were intact.\nBut I must state something before that time. To the other side of the wall,\nbehind the Shrine, was put a wardrobe, which was sometjmes removed in the\npresence of several witnesses, and we had all every reason to be sure that the\nwall was intact. In July or August last year Madame Blavatsky went to\nOotacamund; andshortly afterwards Colonel Olcott, who was then visiting the\nSouth Indian Branches, joined her there. During their absence, the key of\nthe 81witle and of the Occult Room were in my charge, and every week, with-\nout fail, I used to take all the things out of the Shrine, and clean it myself\nwith a towel, many times in the presence of Madame Coulomb, and some-\ntimes when others were there I used to rub the frame hard with the towel,\nand if there were any workable panel at that time, it could not but have\nmoved under the pressure. But I noticed nothing of the kind. The whole\nframe was quite intact, and I can sayfrom positive knowledge that it was 60\ntill the middle of September last. Madame Blavatsky then returned to\nMadras, and I lumded the keys over to her. During that period of nearly\nthree months, I had put in several letters in the Shrine, the key being in\nmy possession, and invariably I received replies. It was then, during that\nperiod, that General Morgan saw the phenomenon of the broken saucer\nmentioned by him in The TheoBOphu,f. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThen he showed us three sliding paJlels to three pieces of furniture\nin Madame Blavatsky's room. These were evidently new. They\ncould not be moved without a great deal of effort and a great\nnoise. One of these, moreover, was to a shelf, to be worked from\noutside, i.e., the passage from the stairs to Madame Blavatsky's\nrooms. At all times the door of the stairs was open, and anyone going up\ncould easily see anyone working it. And, moroover, hardly any phenomena\nwere produced therein. Another of these panels also was to a shelf, to be\nworked from outside, so that anyone standing on the stairs could see what\nthe person was doing. Moreover, the difficulty and the great noise with\nwhich they could be moved distinctly showed their very recent origin and\nthe impracticability of their having been used before.\nFrom MR. DAllODAB.'s Statement concerning the BLAVAT8Ky-COULOMB\nLetters. (Printed in a pamphlet compiled by Dr. HartmallD.)\nSeptember 19th, 1884.\nBut I lUust say a few words in regard to the Shrine itself. As Mrs.\nCoulomb always promised to look after the books and furniture of Madame\nBlavatsky during her absence, the latter always entrusted her with the keys\nof her room, so that the former might be able to see that none of the books\nand furniture were damaged. Accordingly, when Madame Blavatsky went\nto Ootacamund, the keys of her rooms and of the Shrine were as usual\nlumded over to Mrs. Coulomb, with full permission, to all of 1\", to U4e her\nrooma and thing. when~r tee liked. It was oaly in January, 1884, when\nMadame Blavatsky began to dine in the room next to the Occult Room, that\nthe cupboard was put to the wall, so that dishes, plates, &c., might be put\nin it. But this piece of furniture came into existence after the phenomena\nwere nc longer produced ill the Bhrine.-[Yide pp. 228-231.].\nDigitized by Google\n\f338 .Appe\/Ulice8 to Hr.

For the last 12 years or more I have been a teacher\ninteT alia of Natural Science, and have also delivered public lectures on\nscientific subjects, supplemented and illustrated by experiments of various\nkinds. When I was in England in 1870, one of my fa\\'ourite places of resort\nwas the Polytechnic Institution, where. as is well-known, scientific lectures\nare delivered. One of these lectures, I may mention here, was on \"Raising\nGhosts,\" by Profeasor Pepper; and I may say that I am fully conversant\nwith the appliances and apparatus he used to illu8trate his lectures. As a\nhumble devotee of Natural Science, I have studied and lectured upon electric\n.and magnetic phenomena, and although it would be presumptuous-nay,\nabsurd-to say that I \"know all about it,\" yet I may say that J have SOUle\nexperience, theoretical and practical., in manipulating electrical and magnetic\napparatus, including the telephone and the microphone. It was but a few\ndays ago that I was established in this city under the patronage of the\nMaharaja. Besides these pursuits, I may be allowed to state that I have had\nconsiderable experience in \"Parlour Magic,\" \"Prestidigitation,\" &c., &c.,\nwhich, I have always been of opinion, are not only productive of innocent\namusement but also of instruction and Natural Science.\nAs this letter may be published, I hasten to assure y'>u that it is with\nvery great reluctance I make these personal statements to prove the claim\nI, in all humility, put forth to be looked upon as an \"Expert\" in the\ntechnical phraseology of the Law Courts.

Coulomb after Madame Blavatsky's departure. One of thesc is\non the outside of the so-called Occult Room, alld the other is on the outside\nof the sitting-room upstairs. Both of these have been made without the\nslightest attempt at concealment. The former is at the top of a back stair-\ncase and consists of two doors which open into a kind of book-shelf. This\ngives the idea of having been constructed so as to place food on the shelves\ninside without opening the door. The other contril'ance is a sliding panel\nwhich Jifts ur- and opens and shuts with some difficulty. It is evidently of\nrecent construction. Certainly in its present state it would be difficult to\ncarry out any phenomena by its means. In this case also there is no attempt\nat concealment. Neither of these two appliances cOlUmunicate with the\nShrine, which is situated on tlle cross-wall dividing the Occult Room from an\nadjoining bedroom. I was not allowed to see the Shrine.\"\n[Mr. Gribble is not a Theosophist. The preceding pl\\888ge refers to his\nvisit to the headquarters of the Society, on October 3rd, 1884,and tile Shrine\nhad by that time, according to Dr. Hartmann, been destroyed. It would\nappear from Mr. Gribble's account that the sideboard and the entrance to\nthe hollow space were not shown to him. His account of the \"two doors\nwhich open into a kind of book-shelf\" suggests, moreo\\'er, that the double-\nbacked cupboard (see Plan, No.8) had been altered in some way since the\ndismissal of the Coulombs, before it was shown to Mr. Gribble. Dr.\nHartmann (\" Report of Observations,\" &c., p. 43), after speaking of .. thrcu\nsecret openings and sliding panels,\" describes one of themM \" opening into tho\nback of another cupboaro or bookcase, whose front was co\\\"ered by a milTor\nand which was made acce88ible from the hall.\" This is the opening to which\nMr. Gribble must be supposed to refer, tIlough he was apparently not in-\nformed of the existence of the mirror, and had no opportunity of examining\nthe position from within the Occult Room.\nThe sliding-panel to which Mr. Gribble refers is that in the four-\npanelled boarding (plan, No.3). This I ha\\'e myself thoroughly examined,\nand certainly it could, when I saw it, be opened and shut only with consider,\nable difficulty.\n.After the boarding had been placed in its present exposed position, it had\nDigitized by Google\n\fa40 Appendice8 to Hr. Hodgson'8 BePOI\u00b7t\nbeen utilised only once, so far as I could ascertain, in the production of a\nphenomenon. This instance is given in Appendix VI., and it must have\noccurred very shortly after the boarding was placed in the side of the\nsitting-room. When we consider that the panel hadapparently nut been used\nfor about five months previous to the dismissal of the Coulombs, and that for\nseveral months afterwards the rooms were in the po88eaaion of Mr. Damodar,\nwe should be surprised if Mr. Gribble had found the panel in good working\norder. Indeed, a little accidental grit would account for the sti1fneu\nwhich we both observed, and there was a considerable amount of dirt re-\nllembling the dust of mortar in the hole in the terrace made for the panel to\naink into. The panel which slid was the lower east panel, and the wooden\nblock which, according to M. Coulomb, had kept it in its normal position,\nhad apparently been removed. 'l'he position of the panel when I saw it was,\ntherefore, perfectly obvious, in consequence of the hole manifest beneath it;\nbut no trace of its sliding capacity was noticeable in the panel itself when it.\nwas closed; it was, to 0.11 appearance, just as firmly fixed as the other\npanels. Further, the sliding panel did not seem to me to be of more recent\nconstruction than the rest of the boarding, but whether the whole board-\ning was only six months old or a year, or much longer, I could not\nhave told from my own inspection. The question, however, is decisively\nenough answered by Theosophists themselves. (See comments on Mr.\nBabajee's evidence.)\nI may here refer to some remarks made by Mr. Damodar (see his evidence\n(Juoted in this Appendix) concerning these two pieces of \" sliding\" apparatus\nmentioned by Mr. Gribble. According to Mr. Damodar, whose statement\non this point is correct;, they could be seen from the stairs; and he tells us\nfurther that \" at all times, the door of the stairs was open.\" He gives this\ninformation in ol-der to show that the apparatus in question could not have\nbeen used for the production of phenomena (tllOugh he scarcely strengthell8\nhis argument by adding ~hat \"hardly any phenomena were produced\ntherein\") ; but it would seem to show more strongly the impouibility of M.\nCoulomb's having prepared the apparatus at the time he is declared by\nThe080pllistsif to have prepared it;, 'IIi::., in the absence of Madame Blavataky\nat Wadwhan, in February, 1884, after she had left Adyar, but before she had\nleft India. The curiously suspicious incident told by Mr. Babajee (see p.\n330) OCCWTed while Madame Blavatsky was at headqusrters.\nNow it would appear that after Madame Blavataky's departure from\nheadquarters in 1884, the Occult Room and the Shrine were in charge of\nMr.Damodar (see Appendix Xl.); moreover it is apparently not denied by the\nThe080pllists that workmen were about on the terrace during the interval\nassigned to M. Coulomb for his secret work, and according to Mr. Damodar\nthe door of tile stairs was at all times open. If M. Coulomb under these\ncircUDlStancea could, without the knowledge of any persons at head-\nquarters, have constructed the double-backed cUl'boal-d, the panel in the\nboarding, tile sideboard panel, and the aperture into the receu, he would\nllave perfomled a feat which I should find much more difficult of explanation\nthan all Madame Blavatsky's phenomena together. And the discovery that\n-}lr Brown, member of the Board of Control, states that tllis was \"unanl-'\nmously decided\" by the .. gentJemen present\" at the\" disclosure.\"\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn PI,el\/omella COllllectecl\/Citll Theosoph!l. 341\na hole in the wall immediately behind the Shrine had previously existed, but\nhad been blocked up, and that the wall face in the Occult Room belUnd the\nShrine had been carefully whitewashed so as to conceal the traces of the\nhdle, would apparently compel the Theosophists to 88IIume that this hole was,\nunder the same circumstances, not only made but actually closed again, Rnd\nhidden so eWectually by 1\\1. Coulomb in the Occult Room, wlUch was always\nopen to Mr. Damodar, that it was very nearly never discovered at all. And\nof these alleged marvellous works we should have to suppose that Mr.\nDamodar, lUghly-developed Chela of Mahatma Koot Hoomi, remained\nentirely ignOl'&Jlt ! ! I think, therefore, that not only is there no evidence to\nestablish the non-existence of the aperturos and panels in question at\nt.h.e time when phenomena may have been produced by their means, but that\nan insunllountable difficulty lies in the way of supposing that they could\nhave been manufactured at the time to which their origin is attributed by\nthe Theosophists. and that there can be little doubt that they were made\nwhile Madame Bla\\\"atsky herself was at headquartel'B, and under bel' general\ninstructions.]\nAPPENDIX V.\nMR. G.'8 LETTER.\n[Mr. G. gave me an oral account of the followu~g circumstances, and after-\nwards kindly revised my written statement.]\nMr. G. had had several conversations with Madame Blavatsky concerning\nTheosophy before the occurrence of the following incident. He bad not,\nhowever, expretllled any intention of writing a letter to Koot Hoomi.\nOn October 14th, 1883, he wrote a letter addretllled to Mahatma Koot\nHoomi Lal Singh, and after gumming and sealing the envelope, in which\nhe placed the letter, visited the AdyarHeadquartel'B, accompanied by MrB. G.\nThe letter contained some inquiry as to the advisability of Mr. G.'s joining\nthe Theosophical Society. Having obtained pennisaion to place the letter in\nthe Shrine,Ml'. G., withMl'B. G.,Madame Blavatsky,Mr. SubbaRow,and Mr.\nMohini, entered the Occult Room. The Shrine was opened, and Mr. G. was\ninvited to inspect it, which he did from within. No opening of any kind\nwas visible in the back of the Shrine. Mr. G.'s impretlllion is that the\nShrine waspla.cedimmediately in front of a planked walloI' partition which\nseparated the Occult Room in this part from the adjoining room. The Shrine\nappeared to be ratting closely against the west side of this walloI' partition,\nbut the Shrine was not moved at all from its position.\nAfter the letter was placed in the Shrine by Mr. G. himself the door of the\nShrine was locked, and the key given to Mr. G. Shortly afterwards Madame\nBlavataky left the room for a few seconds, and upon returningshe asked Mr.\nG. to go round and examine the eastern side of the wall or partition behind\nthe Shrine. Mr. G. went into the adjoining room (used as a bedroom by\nMadame Blavatsky) and found that some clothes of Madame Blavataky were\nhanging upon the east aide of this partition. The partition consisted of teak\nplanking, and appeared to Mr. G., in the cursory examination to which he\n\u00b7submitted it, to be of solid construction, and he observed no sliding panels.\nDigitized by Google\n\f342 Appelldices to MI'. Hodg80n's Report\nIt was about 6.30 o'clock in the evening, and the light was good.\nMr. G. dol's not regard his examination as complete. The presence or\nMadame Blavatsky's clothes suspended on the partition, Inconveniently pre-\nvented him from scrutinising it ascarefullyas he would have liked to have done;\nand he felt this inconvenience even altho\\UCh Madame Blavatsky herself moved\nsome of the clothes apart and asked him to satisfy himself. They then\nreturned to the Occult Room, and Madame Blavatsky sat down with her back\nto the Shrine, and drummed with herfinger nails upon a small table in front of\nher. A curious, l\"apid ticking was also heard apparently from the Shrine,\nwhicll resembled the ticking heard inside .a watchmaker's shop. Madame\nBlavatsky suddenly asked if he had heard anything. Mrs. G. thought she\nhenrd a noise like the shutting of a door, but did not lI&y so at the time,\nthough she nfterwards told Mr. G. of this fact. Madame Blavataky remarked,\n\" I suspect the letter has gone.\" Mr. G. then opened the Shrine and found\nhis letter had disappeared.\nMr. G. waited some time at the headquarters for an answer t41 his letter,\nbut at last left without having received one. About two hours later, after\ndinner, Mr. }Iohini came over to Mr. G.'s house (which is about a mile from\nMadame Blavatsky's), bringing Mr. G.'sletter, upon the envelope of which\nwas written in blue pencil, \"M(lhini-forward immediately to G. Sahib.-\nK.H.\"\nMr. G. examined the envelope, which was scaled with his own signet\nring which he always wears on his left band, and the envelope appeared to\nhim at that time to be intact. He found no trace of the envelope's having\nbeen opened. Mr. Mohini said the letter fell in the midst of them at Madame\nBlavatsky's as they were talking, and that I\".e had immediately set off with it\nto Mr. G. Mr. G. opened the envelope by cutting the top edge. Upon\nthe lIy-leaf of his letter was written an answer to his question in blue\nllencil, signed K. H.\nMr. G. had previouslyhoped tltat he might receive an immediate answer to\nhis letter, nnd after reviewing the circumstances of the incident, he concluded\ntlmt there was a p088ibility that his letter might have been opened in some\nway or other, after having been taken surreptitiously from the Shrinc through\nthe teak-panelled door which he had so cursorily examined.\nHe therefore wrote another letter addre88ed to Koot Hoomi, and in it\nrequested that the answer to it might fall in the open air outside his (Mr.\nG.'s) own house. This letter he asked Mr. Mohiui to take, but Mr. Mohini\ndeclined to do so ; and Madame Blavatskyafterwards wrote to Mr. G.\u2022 offering\nreasons why Ius request could not be complied Witll.\nSince these occurrences, Mr. G. has had no communication with\nMadame Blavatsky.\nMr. G. kindly permitting me to examine tile envelope, I found certain\nnoteworthy peculiarities in the aeal-impre88ion. A portion of the wax bad\nadhered to the seal, so tltat the paper was visible at one point near the centre\nof the seal-imprcssion. This had been noted by Mr. G. at the time of his\nmaking the impre88ion, and the scsI at first glance appeared to be entirely\nintact. The right flap of the envelope, however, appeared crumpled, and a\nlens revealed a slight crack on the right side of the seal, and also a very\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn P\/lcuomCila cOllllcctcd ICit\/, Tlzcosqphy. 343\nminute fracture on the same side, at tile very edge of the wax, beyond th&\nlimits of the seal-impression. It seemed as tllough a very small fragment of\nwax had been broken away, and close inspection showed that the right\nflap of tli~ envel~~ welS 'lI~t held at all by the wax. Cutting down the side-\nedges of the envelope I found the rigllt flap llardly adllering at all to the rest.\nof the paper, and the part which had been covered with gum presented the\nappearance of having been steamed, or otherwise moisl;ened, though this is\nsomewhat difficult to determiue with any certainty. There was also a mark\nof gum extending c.msiderably beyond the limit of the flap. The appearanoo\nsuggested that the right flap had been withdrawn, that a small drop of gum\nhad been placed near tho edge of the withdrawn flap, and that part of this\ndrop had oozed out beyond the line of the flap when the envelope was pressed\nafter replacing the flap. The colour of this gum was somewhat different\nfrom the gum on the opposite flap, being yellower and dirtier than what\nappeared to he the original gum of the envelope. There was also, as I after-\nwards found, a mark of \\vhat appeared to be gum, in a corresponding position\nori the enclosed note itself.\nMr. G. llas on various occasions handled the envelope, and it may b&\nurged that the seal-impression held all the flap-joinings together when the\nletter was written Illorc than a year previously. This, of course, cannot be\ndisproved, but it is important to observe that Mr. G.'s attention had not\nbeen before given to the possibility that one of the under flaps might be\nwithdrawn as I have suggested, and he was unaware that the seal-impression\nsecured only three of the flaps. This is proved by the fact that he showed\nme the sealed letter which he had offered to Mr_ llohini, and which he still\nhad in his posse88ion. The right-hand flap of this envelope also was free\nfrom the seal-impression in precisely the same way as the flap of the\nntherenvelope.\nFrom the appearances described I infer that Madame Blavatsky probably\nopened the letter in the way implied above.\n[p.S.-I had given to Mr. Sinnett in conversation an account of the above\nincident, and shortly afterwards, at the General Meeting of May 29th, Mr.\nMohini informed me that he had heard a description of the case from Mr.\nSinnett. Mr. Mohini then proceeded to suggest that Mr. G. had omitted\nto mention an important circumstance to me, viz., that Mr. G. had\nattempted, when the letter in question was returned to him, to open it by\napplying a heated knife-blade to the seal. Mr. Mohini, I inferred, had not.\nheard every detail ofthe case as above given, and he apparently thought\nthat the disturbance of the seal and the crumpling of the envelope might be\naccounted for by the attempt which he alleged Mr. G. had made. They\ncould not, however, be thus accounted for, and I felt certain, from my\nexamination of the seal, that no person could have made any attempt to\nremove it by means of a heated knife-blade. Moreover, I thought it much\nmore probable that Mr. Mohini should have remembered an even~ which had\nnot occurred, than that Mr. G. should have omitted to inform me of the\ncircumatanceallegcd. Nevertheless, Mr. Mohini's statement was so explicit\nthat I considered myself bound to mention it at the meeting of June 26th.\nwhen I had occasion to refer to the incident. In the meantime I had taken\nthe tint opportunity of writing to Mr. G. on the subject, and the following is\nDigitized by Google\n\f314 .Appendices to MI', HOtl08011'8 Rrport\nhis reply of June 25th, which, so far as I am conccrned in it, is in exact\naccordance with my own recollectiolls:-\n\" Mohini's memory must either ha\"e failed him or elae he must have\nwilfully misrepresented the matter to you. I did NOT attempt to open the\nseal of the letter, whicll I put into the eabinet, with a heated knife, hut I\ndid take another Bimilar eR1Iewpe and the 88l1le sea.li.nf{-wax and seal that I\nhad used for sealing that letter, and having sealed the envelope I tried to\nsee if a heated knife-blade would lift the seal and found it would not do SQ.\nMy wife was present andsaw nle do this, and now confirms my statement.\n\"It is not likely that I would do anything to the seal of the original cover\nof the original letter, and if 1 had done so I should have told you of the fact\nand you yourself would have discovered where the wax had been melted by\nthe hot knife-blade.\n\" The original seal, being made of wax, dropped blazing on the envelope,\nburnt the papera little, that is, itsinged it brown,as you may remember I told\nyou j more()ver, a small piece stuck to my signet-ring and eaQ1e away with it,\nthus rendering it imp0&3ible to attempt any trifting with the seal by means of\nheat without my detecting it immediately, while any BUch attempt on my\npart would probablyhave defaced the impreaaion of the signet-ring, which you\nknow was intact and perfect.\"]\nAPPENDIX VI.\n{T\"aE \"lU.MASWA.VYS ..4.RM\" PHENOMENO.V.\nThe teak door in its new position (..Me p. 222), seems to have been\nutilised in connection with the following phenomenon.\nSupplement to The Thernoplti&t, February, 1884.\nIn these days of scepticism :md unbelief, the following testimony to a\nphenomenon, not eapable of being explained on any theory of trick or fraud,\nwill be not without use in exciting at le.ut a spirit of cairn inquiry in\nreasonable minds.\nOn the 24th of November, lIre S. Ramaawamier and myself both went\nto the Adya.r headqua.rters at about 9 p.m. We found Madame Blavatsky\nseated in the verandah in front of the main building conversing with General\nand Mrs. Morgan and Miss Flynn, then on a visit to the headqua.rters,\nand a number of Chew and officers of the Theosophical Society. After\nabout an hour's conversation there, Madame Blavatsky wished good-night\nto our European brethren and went upstairs to her own room, asking us\nto follow her thither. Accordingly we went up. There were seven in all in\nthe room, which was lighted. Madame Blavatsky seated herself facing west\non a chair near a window in the north\u00b7eastern corner of the room.\nS. Ramaawamier and myself sat on the floor, one behind the other, right in\nfront of and facing Madame Blavatsky, close by an open shelf in the wall on\nour left. Babu Mohini Mohun Chatterji, M.A., B.L., (solicitor, Calcutta)\nMe88rs. Babajee, Ananda, and Balai Chand Mallik, also seated on the floor\nnear us, opposite the wall-shelf and facing it. What bad originally been a.\nwindow was closed with a thick wooden plank, which on careful examination\nI found was immovably fixed to the window frame and thus converted into II.\nDigitized by Google\n\f011 Phellomena l'omU!ded teilA T\"e~op\"!I. 345\nwall-shelf with two craBB board~. The plank behind was hung and tho\nboards were covered and ornamented with black oil cloth and fringe. About\nhalf-an-hour after conversation began, while S. Ramaswamier was talking\nabout certain important matters concerning himself and the others were\nlistening, a slight rustle of the oil cloth, hanging in the back of the middle\neompartment of the wall-shelf, was observed by the four gentlemen\nseated opposite the same. From it, immediately after, was extruded a\nlarge hand more brown in complexion than white, dressed in a close fitting\nwhite sleeve, holding an envelope between the thumb and the forefinger.\nThe hand came just opposite my face and over the back of S. RanUUlwamier's\nhead, a distance of about two yards from the wall, and at a jerk dropped\nthe letter, which fell close by my side. All, except S. Ramaswamier, saw\nthe phantom hand drop the letter. It was visible for a few seconds, and\nthen vanished into air right before our eyes. I picked up the envelope,\nwhich was made of Chinese paper evidently, and inscribed with some\n(:haracters which 1 was told were Tibetan. 1 had seen the like before with\nS. Ramaswamier. Finding the envelope was addreBBed in English to\n.. Ramaswamy Iyer,\" 1 handed it over to him. He opened the envelope and\ndrew out a letter. Of the contents thereof I am not permitted to say more\nthan that they had immediate reference to what S.

As regardS the handwriting of the letter, it\nwas shown to me, and 1 readily recognised it as the same that 1 had seen in\nother letters shown me long before by S. Ramaswamier as having been\nreceived from his Guru (also Madame Blavatsky's master). 1 need hardly\nadd that immediately after 1 witneBSed the above phenomenon, I examined\nthe shelf wall, plank, boards, and all inside and outside with the help of a.\nlight, and was thoroughly satisfied that there was nothing in any of them\nto suggest the pOBBibility of the existence of any wire, spring, or any other\nmechanical contrivanCe by means of which the phenomenon could have been\nproduced. 1 M F T S\nV. COOPOOSWAMY YER, .A., ...,\nZlth Nor:ember, 1883.\nPleader, Madura.\nI\" reply to my questions :-1 first questioned Mr. Coopooswamy Iyer\nalone downstairs. He was very doubtful about the distance of the hand from\nthe wall, and seemed surprised that in his account the distance was given as\ntlDO yards. He said it might be a yard or a yard and a-half. He had not\nobserved anything beyond the hand and part of the ann, had not looked\nbeyond this,-could not say whether it ended in a stick, or in nothing at all.\nThe hand and arm appeared from behind the hangings of the shelf, dropped\nthe letter, and were immediately gone. His examination of the shelf antl\nplanks behind appears to have been very incomplete. I took him upstairs\nand asked him to describe the positions, and to hold Ilia finger at the point\nwhich the \"hand\" reached. Madame Blavatsky was in the room, and\nrequested me to get the tape and measure the distance. The measuring tape\nwas in another room. 1 observed closely the position of Mr. C. Iyer's\nfinger before I left for the tape. 1 was away about half-a-minute, leaving\nMadame Blavatsky talking with Mr. C. Iyer about the position. When I\nreturned the finger was at least \"foot further away from the wall. The\ndistance then measured was 4ft. Din.\nz\nDigitized by Google\n\f316 App('mlkes to MI'. Hodgsoll's R'port\n1 received two accounta within a few minutes from Mr. RalJla8wamier as\nto the respective positions of the sitters, and in his second account both be\nand Mr. C. Iyer were represented as sitting in placea quite two feet nearer\nthe shelf than as deSClibed ill bis first account. Moreover, the words in tbe-\nletter received by Mr. Ramaswamier were not more specific than might\neasily have been written before the conversation referred to took place.\nThey were a general injunction beginning \"Patience! Patience!\"\nMr. Babajee did not see the hand, he was not looking.in that direetion\n~t tile moment. He heard a sligbt noise and saw the letter on the floor.\nAnanda (Mr. T. Vijiaraghava Charloo) saw the curtain before the shelf\nstirring as though a wind was passing. He then saw a hand and arm come-\nout from behind the curtain. It came out about a foot ora foot and Ii-half,\nabout up to the elbow. The letter fell, and his attention was drawn to the-\nletter. Then hand and arm were gone.\nAfter the sliding panel was shown in the teak door, tbe defence made was.\nthat the arm had come from the right side of the shelf, whereas the slidiJlg\npanel was on the l#ft side. 1 found it perfectly easy, however, to thrust my\narm through the gap made when the panel slid, and to tunl it in the shelf\nrecess (which was concealed by tile curtains) so that it should appear beyond\nthe curtains in front of tbe right panel instead ofthe left, and as far forward\nas described by Ananda. 1 discussed the discrepancies in the different.\naccounta with Messrs. RalJla8wamier and CoopooswanlY Iyer i and Mr. Lane-\nFox, who afterwards heard of the different accounta, expressed his conviction\nof the worthlessness of the phenomenon as 1\\ test, and assured me thl\\.t in\na later conversation with Madame Blavataky she admitted that the\n\" phenomenon\" probably originated with and was carried out by the\nCoulombs for the purpose of enabling them afterward,. to discredit other\n\" pbenomenl\\ \" more easily. Yet Madame Blavataky had sbortly before been\nendeavouring to persuade me that the ann must have been \"astral,\" and\nurgmg how infinitely impossible it was for the\" phenomenon\" to have been\nother titan 1\\ genuine manifestation of the \"occult power,\" which the\ninitiates of the \"esoteric science\" are alleged to possess.\nAccording to M.

GURNEY: Going back to the first apparition, it soema somewhat\nBtartiing to be told that you could recognise the face at such a distance oft',\nand in moonlight. Do you feel sure that if you had seen the face alo.ne you\nwould Itave recognised it 1\nMR. MOHINI: I cannot answer that. I saw the whole thing, and the\nwhole thing. taken together, produced upon me the impression that it was\nthe apparition of the original of the portrait in Colonel Olcott's room. Had\nI Been the face alone, peering out of the dark, I do not know whether I\nshould have recognised it or not.\nMR. STAOK:: Do all the Mahatmas dress alike1\nMR.

R.uuswAlllBR (District Registrar, MAdura).\n1.\nAt the end of the following year (1882), at the headquarters at Bombay\u2022\n\u2022 veral of us were together on the upper balcony. I am unable to recollect\nany of the others. I suddenly saw, at the distance of abcut 15 pwes. a\ngleaming 8llbstance which aaaumed the figure of a man. It was not walking\non the ground, but appeared to be gliding through mid-air among the top-\nDigitized by Google\n\f0\" PI,enome,UJ eDlwected flJill\u2022.Theosophy. 349\nmost branches of the trees. It glided forwards and backwards four or five\ntimes. I could not recogniae the person, could not see whether it had a\nbeard or not, cannot say whether it was tall or not. The night was moon\u00b7\nlight. Time between eight and nine p.m.\n2.\nAbout the same time, at the end of 1882, I was sitting with Madame\nBlavatsky, Madame Coulomb, Norendra, Janaki, Nobin K. Bannerji, and\nothers in a verandah adjoining Madame Blavatsky's writing-room.\nOn one side was a hill gradually rising to a top. The hill was covered\nwith thorns. I saw something like a flash of light, and graduallyitassumed the\nfigure of a }M'rson about 20 feet distant. Time between 7 and 8 p.m.\nI cannot say whether it was moonlight or not. I did not recogniae the figure ;\ncannot say whether it had a beard or not; cannot say whether it had a\nturban or not. Madame went near the foot of the hill and exchanged somo\nsigns with the figure. Madame then went to her room by the path on our\nside, and the figure went in the direction of MadaDle's room by the other side.\nAfterwlU'da Madame came to us in great excitement and said that one of\nthe delegates had polluted the house, and it was for this reason the figure\ncould not come near UL Shortly after the figure again appeared on the hill.\nand suddenly vanished, leaving a brightness which gradually faded away.\nAccount by MR. NOBIN KJusHlfA BANKBJLJI (Deputy Magistrate and\nDeputy Collector, and Manager-General of Wards' Estates in Moorshe.\ndabad, Bengal).\n1.\nOn the occasion of the seventh anniversary. in 1882, one evening before the\nanniversary celebration, at Ilbout 7 p.m., I was sitting in the balcony of\nthe headquarters in Bombay, in company with Norendra Nath Sen, Mobini,\nMadame, Ramaswamier, and several others. We were talking when Madame\nsaid, \"Don't move from your seat until I say,\" or something to that eft\"ect.\nThis made us expect that something was about to happen. Some were\nstanding near the railing of the balcony, others were seated a little back.\nAfter a few moments those standing nearthe rails laW something, and made\nsome remarks which induced the rest of the party, excepting myself and\nNorendra, to get up and go to..wards the rails, and look at the object. We\ndidn't stir, as nothing further was said by Madame, but kept turning our\nheads in expectation of seeing something. But we didn't perceive anything.\nSome four or five minuteli after, we inferred from the remarks made,\nthat the others had seen some luminous astral figure walking to and fro\nbelow the balcony on tbe side of the hill. It was not pitch dark. Objects\ncould be seen at a distance, but not distinguished clearly.\n2.\nThe same party with the addition of Mr. Ghosal were sitting together OD\nthe Dortb. extremit.y of the bungalow facing the sea, at about 7.30 p.m.\u2022\nwhen some remark of Madame's made us expect to see something inlme\u00b7\ndiately. Shortly after we saw a form standing on a rock close to the\nadjoining bungalow, about 10 ylU'da distant. The light was about the sarna\nDigitized by Google\n\f350 .tl.ppelUlice, 10 Mr. Dodg8011'8 Report\nas on tlle previous occaaion. There Wl\\8 no tree near and the figure cuuld\nbe seen clearly. The figure Wl\\8 ,dreaaed in a white flowing garment, with\na lIght coloured turban, and a dark beard. The figure was that of a man\nof apparently ordinary size, but I,could not recognise who it was. From\nmy description Colonel Olcott recogni.Jed one of the Mahatmas. He men-\ntioned the name, which we afterwards found to be correct, l\\8\nMadame and Damodar corroborated it. The figure seemed faintly luminous,\nbut I am unable now to recollect any further details concerning its\ndf'.acription. The figure gradually \\-aniahed, and for a minute or two after-\nwards the place where it had been aeemed to be gleaming with a\nmilky brightness. The rock itself has IODle dH.te and other trees upon it,\nbu~ the spot where the figure appeared was bare. The figure was standing\natill when we saw it.\nAccount by MR. CHANDRA SEKHARA. (Teacher in High School, Bareilly,\nN.W.P.).\n1.\nIn 1882 I went to Bombay in November, reaching there on tJle morning\nC)f 26th inst. The anniversary was postponed from Noveluber 27th to\nD~ember 7th. On the evening of the 27th, about 8 p.m., we, i.e., about\n10 or 11 of us, including the delegates, were seated in the balcony with\nMadame B. and Colonel Olcott. Mohini M. Chatterji, Biahen Lall, and\nJanaki Nath GhOllaI were present. We were chatting together, and Madame\n'Blavatsky, with some other brethren, quickly rose up, and looked towards the\ngarden below the balcony. I rose up and looked out, but not in tJIe proper\ndirection. J. N. Ghoaal pointed me to the prol>er quarter, and I saw a\nluminous figure walking to and fro below the balcony, on the third terrace\nfield. [This was explained to mean that there were two fields and a portion\nof a third between the speaker and the figure.1 Each field is about 10 yards\nwide. The third field is full of thorny trees, 10 that it.is difficult for a man\nto walk freely. The trees varied in size, and the fQliage occupied a good\ndeal of space. Tho figure was upright. I saw him walk three times over\na distance of about 40 yards, and then disappear. There was no moonlight.\nThe figure appeared nearly 6ft. high, well\u00b7built, but I could not distin\u00b7\nguish the features. I could not tell whether he had a beard. My sight is\nordinary.\n2.\nThe following day we were seated in the verandah near the Occult\nRoom, when Madame said that she felt IOmething extraordinary. The tinle\nwas between 7 and 8 p.m. Suddenly we saw the luminous body of one\nwho was explained to DIe to be another Mahatma, on the high rock adjoin-\ning tJle Occult Room. The distance of tJIe figure was about 16 yards.\nMadame Coulomb was with us. I could not distinguish the features clearly,\nnut sufficient for recognition. I cannot say whether tJIe figure had a beard.\nAI& BOOn as we saw the figure, Madame Coulomb exclainted, in a nervous\nmanner, \"There! There!\" And in a minute Colonel Olcott said, \"Madame\n[Blavatsky1, go to the foot of tho roc~, and talk to the Mahatma.II Madame\nwent to the rock, and in a short time after she came back ahivering, and said\nDigitized by Google\n\fOil PltellomeWJ cOimeckd tcjfl, Tlte08oph!J. 351\nthe Mahatma would be willing to come forward to talk to the audience, but\nthere was some man in our company whose sin wAs so great that it would be\ndifficult for the Mahatma to approach, and therefore he had to go away.\nThe figure disappeared suddenly before Madame returned.\nAccount by MR. J. N. GROSAL (.Allahabad).\nOne evening, at the Bombay headquarters, on the 27th or 28th of\nNovember, 1882, about 9 or 10 p.m., Madame Blavatsky, Mobini, Chandra\nSekbara, Damodar, Nobin Krishna Bannerji, Norendra Nath Sen, and a\nfew others besides myself, were sitting in the balcony. Some of them had\nbeen called there by me, as I was then expecting that some phenomeno.\nwould take place. My attention was drawn by a sound among some trees\ndown below, about 10 yards from the balcony. The sound was like the\nstirring of leaves. Immediately after I saw the tall figure of a man\napparenUy more than 6ft. in height, clad in white, ncar the trees. It was\na clear moonlight night. The figure was well-built. I could not distinguish\nthe features very well, saw something like a beard, but not very distinctly.\nA white turban was on the head. The figure begall to walk backwards and\nforwards for two or three minutes. Madame Coulomb joined the group,\nand the figure disappeared, making the same kind of sound, like stirring of\nleaves, which I heard before the appearance of the figure. But it appeared to\nme, and a few of thOle present were of the same opinion, that the figure\nwalked over one of the trees and suddenly disappeared. Not being able to\n-distinguish the features, I inquired of Madame, and was told it was the\nastral appearance of her Master.\nNext morning I went to the spot where the figure appeared, and found\nthe spot so low that anyone walking on the ground could not haye been en\u00b7\ntirely scen from the balcony.\n[This is the only\" astral figure\" Mr. Ghow has seen.]\nAccount by MR. NORENDRA NATR SEN (Editor of the Indian Mirrtn', Calcutta).\nI saw the astral figure on the rock at the Bombay headquarters. It was\n, or 8 p.m., and the figure was about 20 yards distant. I recognised no more\nthan that it appeared to be the figure of a man, who came down fl\"(ml the\nrock and went with Madame Blavatsky into her room.\nTHIRD ALLEGED ASTRAL APPARITION.\nMR. MORINI: The third instance which I will describe was the last that\n.occurred just before my leaving India. We were sitting ill the drawing\u00b7\nroom on the first 1I00r of the house at Adyar. It was about 11 o'clock at\n!light. The window looks over a terrace or balcony. In one comer of the\nroom there appeared a thin vapoury substance of a shining white colour.\nGradually it took shape, and a few dark spots beCaDle visible, and after\na short time it was the fully-formed body of a man, apparently 8S solid M\nan ordinary human body. This figure Imssed and repassed us several times,\napproaching to within a distance of a yard or two from where we were\nstanding near the window. It approached so near that I think if I had Pll:t\nout my hand I might have touched it.\nDigitized by Google\n\f352 .Appendices to Jh', Hodg801l'8 Report\nMR. STACK: Did you see the face clearly 1\nMR. MOBINI: Oh, yes; very clearly.\nMR. MYEBB: And it was Mr. Sinnett's correspondent?\nMR. MOBINI: Yes.\nMR. STACK: How did you identify him as Koot Hoomi 1\nMR. MOBINI : Because I hsd seen his portrait several times before.\nMR. STACK: Had you ever seen him in the flesh 1\nMR. MOJluu: I cannot answer that, I explained to you the reason\nwhy I could not. Colonel Olcott can, but I cannot.\nMR. MYEBB: Are we to understand, then, that, \"'hen favours are\naccorded by a Mahatma for the sake of the Chela's own spiritual advance-\nment, there is a rule which forbids the Chela to describe them, with the\nview of preventing spiritual pride 1\nMR. MOJlINI: I have not been told the reason, but tJl8.t is, I believe, thl)\nreason.\nMR. MYEBB: Will you continue your account 1\nMR. MOBINI: After a while I said that as I should not see him for a long\ntime, on account of my going to Europe, I begged he would leave soma\ntangible mark of his visit. The figure tJlen raised his hands and seemed to\nthrow something at us. The next moment we found a shower of roses\nfalling over us in the room-roses of a kind that could not have been pro-\ncured on the premises. We requested the figure to disappea1' from that side\nof the balcony where there was no exit. There was a tree on the other side,\nand it was in order to prevent all suspicion that it might be something that.\nhad got down the tree, or anything of that kind, t.hat we requested hun to-\ndisappear from the side where there was no exit. The figure went over t<;\nthat spot and then disappeared.\nMR. MYEBB: You saw its disappearance 1\nMR. MOBINI: Oh yes, it passed us slowly until it came to the edge or\nthe balcony, and then it was not to be seen any more.\nMR, MYERS: The disappearance being sudden 1\nMR. MOBINI: Yea.\nMR. GURNEY: Was the height of tho balcony such that anyone could.\nhave jumped down from it 1\nMR. MOBINI: The height was 15 or 20 feet, ana, moreover, there were:\npeople downstairs and allover the house, so that it would have been impOBBi:\nble for a person to have jumped down without being noticed. Just below\ndie balcony thero is an open lawn. There were several persons looking at.\nthe moment, and my own idea is that it would have been perfectJy UnpOBBibl&\nfor a person to havo jumped down.\nMR. STACK: Why 1\nMR. MOBlNI: There is a SDlall flight of steps just below the balcony, and.\nif a Dlan had jumped from the balcony he must have fallen upon the steps.\nand broken his legs. When. the figure passed and re-passed us we heard\nnothing ofany footsteps. Besides myself, Damodar and Madame Blavatsky\nwere in the room at the time.\nMr. MYEBB: Did this figure speak?\nMR.

MOHINI: The mootdight, and the figuro came to wiUtin so short a.\ndistance that the light, which was streaming out of the window, fell upon\nit. This was at the Madras headquarters, about either the end of January\nor tho beginning of February last; in fact, just before I left Madras.\nMR. STACK: What kind of roses were they that they could not be grown\nat Madras?\nMR. MORINI: I said th'lt they could not have been procured 011 tha\npremises, though, indeed, I have not seen any such roBe8 at Madras.\nMR. STACK: What was the colour of the figure? Was it perfectly\nnatural?\nMR. MOHINI: When it came, it was just like a natJraI mall.\nMR. MyERS: Can you give any reason why this figure was, different in\ncolour and aspect from those which you saw on the fonner occasions?\nMR. MORINI : The luminosity* depends upon whether all the principles.\nwhich go to make up a double are there, without any gross particles being\nattracted. . ,\nl\\1R. MYERS: Groaa matter is present when the figure is non-luminous?\nMR. MORINI: YC8.\nMR. STACK: This figure looked like an ordinary man? If you had not\nbelieved that it was the Mahatma Koot Hoomi, you would have thought it.\nwas an ordinary man 1\nMR.

On that morning we were discuBBing as to\nwhether we should go into the country, to a place where Madame\nBlavatsky was then staying, and we decided upon doing 80.

Arriving\n\u2022 I have no doubt that what Mr. l\\Iohini terms the \"luminosity\" was\nmerely the moonlight reftected from the white robes of the figure.

On this particular morning he called at about\n:t,L30 a.m., and after some conversation as to what they should do, they\ndecided to go to Engbien. Mr. Oakley went into a sort of spare room [to\nshave]. Mr. Keightley went to his own room, and in 2 or 3 minutes\ncame in to Mr. Oakley, and asked if Mr. Oakley had called him. He had\nheard his name called-Bert. [Bertram.] Mr. Keightley then left Mr.\nOakley, and after a short interval returned, and asked him to come and look\nat something he had received. Mr. Oakley went back with him, and saw\nDigitized by Google\n\f856 Appl'Jldi(~e8 to Mr. HodUflOIl'8 Report\nupon a large round table, about 3 paces from the door of Mr. KeightIey'.\nroom, a letter.

Mr. KeightIey explained\nto Mr. Oakley that the letter was not on the table when he kft the room, as\nhe had been placing some articles on the table, &0., and must have obaerved\nit had it been there. Mr. Oakley remarked that he tIlought it poaaible for\nBabula to have slipped into the room immediately after Mr. KeightIey's leav-\ning it, and to have deposited the letter on tile table, and departed without.\nhaving been seen in the act.\n.Account by MR.

Mr.\nOakley had not been to the rooms previously. Mr. KeigbtIey heard his\nname called and left his own room to inquire if Mr. Oakley had called him.\nHe proceeded to the ro0111 where Mr. Oakley was engaged. There were\ntwo ways of entering this room after paBBing a short distance along the\npall8&ge upon which 1\\lr. Keightley's room opened.\nOne way \\\\'1\\11 through the corner of \u00b0a small drcB8ing-room between Mr.\nKeightIey's rool11 and the room where Mr. Oakley tIlen was; another way\nwas through the drawing-room where Mr. Mohlni was seated. 0 Mr.\nKeightIey is unable to recollect certainly which way was taken by him, and\nhe cannot be certain whether he actually went into Mr. Oakley's room, but\nthinks he went just inside. .After asking Mr. Oakley whether he had\ncalled his (Mr. Keightley's) name [Bert], and receiving Mr. Oakley's reply in\nthe ne~tive, he returned immediately to his own room, and Mr. Mohini\nfollowed him on his return. Mr. KeigbtIey on returning lUld entered his\nroom and bad not quite paBBed the table when Mr. Mohini, who was barely\ninside tile door, called out. He was about 3 paces from the table. Mr.\nKeightIey turned round and saw tile letter lying on the table, between him-\nself and the door, and at such a distance fro111 him that he could reach tlJe\nletter by leaning over. Mr. Mohini bad not touched tile letter, whieh was\nlying squarely 011 tile table as tIlough neatly placed there. The letter was\nbeyond the reach of Mr. Mohini.

Mr. Keightley\nthinks that Babula was in the dreaaing-room at the time. This dreaaing-\nroom opened into the comer room where Mr. Oakley WIUI, but not into Mr.\nKeightley's room.\nAfter I had read Mr. Oakley's account to him, Mr. Keightley thought he\noould negativft the poaaibility referred to by Mr. Oakley, that Babula could\nhave placed the letter on the table. Mr. Keightley thinks the time of his\nabsence was 80 short that Babula could not have escaped being seen by him,\n~omewhere in the room or in the paaaage, while ho was returning.\nAccount written by Ma. KBIOHTLBY, in June, 1884.\nOn the following day, [May 14th,] Madame Blavatsky and Mr. Judge\nbeing both at Enghien, whare they had gone the previous day, I was sitting\nabout 10.30 a.m., in the salon chatting with Mr. Oakley and Mr. Mohini.\nWe had decided not to go to Enghien, and the subject bad been dropped,\nwhen I felt a sudden impulse to go there, This suggestion of a change of\nplan was acceptA!d after a little hesitation, Mr. Mohini' having the same\nfeeling. I therefore went to our room to get ready, and WIUI engaged in\narranging my toilette when I thought I heard Mr. Oakley calling me. Going\n-out into the passage, just outside tht'door, I called to know what he wanted.\nFinding that he had not called me, I TO-entered th'l room, Mr. Moluni\nfollowing me from the sal!;n at a yard or two's distance. I had reached the\nmiddle of the room when I heard hinl ('.aIling me from the doorway, and\nturning round J aaw him standing on the threshold. I must here state that\nneeding a certain article which I thought was on the table, I had thoroughly\n.searched everything on it, and had cleared a space at the ond next the door\nto put my ring and glaaaea on.\nOn turning lound then, I at once noticed a Chinese envelope lying as if\narefully placed there, on the cleared end of the table next the door. This\nenvelope I at once recognised as being like those used by Mahatma K. H.,\nand also recognised his writing in the addreaa. Having called my friend Mr.\nOakley, llr. Mohini opened the envelope, which contained a long letter from\nhis Master K.H. (of 3pagea), and concluded with an order to him to take\nMr. Oakley and myself with him to Enghien for a few hours, thus showing\n.an acquaintance with the question previously under diacuaaion, and also the\nfact, known only to three or four persona in London, and about the same\nnumber in Paris, that my friend Mr. Oakley was then ill Paris and actually\n. in the house. Mr. Oakley was staying with BOrne friends about 20 minutes\nwalk distant, while he was in Paria.\nTIlE 8TRANGB VOI<:B.\n[The following passage from Mr. Mohini's delJOaitioll may alao be\nworthy of note.]\nMR.

BAMASWAMIER-\nAs considerable importance has been attached to the experiences of Mr.\nRamaswamier, it will be best to gh'e the reader full opportunity of judging\nfor himself what they come to. His first sight of a \"Mahatma\" is described\nas follows (\" Hints on Esoteric Theosophy,\" No. I, pp. 72\u00b773):-\n[,CERTIFICATE. ]\n\"Bombay, December 28th, 9 p.m., 1881.\n\"The undel'8igncd, returning a few moments since from a carriage ride\nwith Madame Blavat&ky, saw, as the ClUTiage approached the house, a man\nupon the balcony over the l)()IU cuche\"e, leaning against the balustrade, and\nwith the moonlight shining full upon hUll. He was dressod in white, and\nwore a white FeMa. on his head. His beard was black, and llis long black\nhair hung to his breast. Olcott and DamudaI' at once recognised him as the\n'Illustrious.'\u00b7 He raised his hand and dropped a letter to us. Olcott jumped\nfrom the can'iago and l'ecovered it. It was written in Tibetan charactel'8,\nand signed with his familiar cipher. It was a message to Ramaswamier, Ul\nreply to a letter (in a closed em'elope) which he had written to the BrotIler\n1\\ \"hort tune before we went out for the ride.

Jt is abridged from \"How A' CHBLA 'roUND.HI8 'GURU.'\"\n(Being extracts from a private letter to Damodal' K. Mavalankar, Joint\nRecording Secretary of the ThOOllOphical Society.)\n\" When we met last at Bombay I told you what had happened to me at.\nTinnevelly. My health having been disturbed by official work and worry, I\napplied for leave on medical certificate and it was duly granted. One day in\nSeptember last, while I was reading in my room, I was ordered by the audible\nvoice of my blessed Guru, M--- Maharsi, to leave all and proceed\nillllllediately to Bombay, whence I had to go in search of Madame\nBla\"atsky wherever I could find her and follow !ler wherever shG\nwent. Without losing a moment, I closed up all my affairs and left\u00b7 the\nstation.\" Mr. Ramaswamier then describes how after journeying about, he-\nat last found Madame Blavatsky at Chandernagore, and followed her to\nDarjeeling. \" The first days of her arrival Madame Blavatsky was living\nat the house of a Bengalee gentleman, a Theosophist, was refusing to see\nanyone; and preparing, as I thought, to go again somewhere 011 the borders\nof Tibet. To all our importunities we could get only this answer from her:\nthat we had no business to .tick to lind follow Mr, that she did not want us,\nand that she had no right to disturb tIle Mahatmas with all sorts of questioM\nthat concerned o~ly the questioners, for they knew their own business best.\nIn despair I determind, com8 tchat miflht, to cross the frontier, which is about\na dozen miles from here, and find the Mahatmas,or-DIB.\" He describea\nhow he started on October 5th, crossed the river\" which forms the boundary\nbetween the British and Sikkhim territories,\" walked o~ t~ll ,dark, spent.\nthe night in a wayside hut, and on the following morning continued his\njourney.\n.. It was, I think, between 8 and 9 a.m. and I was following the road\nto the to}Vn.of .Sikkhim whence, I was 888ured by the people J met on the.\nDigitized by Google ..'\n\f360 Appel\/dices to M,.. Hodgsol\/'s Rrport\nroad, I could cross over to Tibeteasily in my pilgrim's garb, when I suddenly\nsaw a 80litary horseman galloping towards me from the opposite direction.\nFrom his tall stature and the expert way he managed the animal, I thought\nhe WI\\8 some military officer of the Sikkhim Rajah. Now, I thought, am I\ncaught! He willl\\8k me- for my pass and what business I have on the inde-\npendent territory of Sikkhim, and, perhaps, have me arrested and_ent back,\nif not worse. But, 1\\8 he approached me, he reined the steed. I looked at\nand recognised him instantly. . . I WI\\8 in the awful presence of him, of\nthe same Mahatma, my own revered 011\"' whom I had soon before in his\nastral body, on the balcony of the Theosophicalheadquarters I ItWI\\8 he, the\n, Himalayan BROTHBR' of the ever memorable night of December last, who\nhad so kindly dropped a letter in answer to one I had given in a sealed\nenvelope to Madame Blavatsky-whom I had never for one mc>ment during\nthe interval lost sight of-but an hour or 80 before! The very same instant\nsaw me prostrated on the ground at his feet. I arose at his command and,\nleisurely looking into his face, I forgot myself entirely in the con-\ntemplation of the image I knew 80 well, having seen his llOrtrait (the one in\nColonel Olcott's possession) a number of times. I knew not what to say; joy\nand reverence tied my tongue. The majesty (If his countenance, which\nseemed to me to be the impe\"llQllation of power and thought, held me rapt in\nawe. I was at last face to face with 'the Mahatma of the Himavo.t' and he\nwas no myth, no \u2022creation of the imagination of a medium,' as 80me sceptics\nsuggested. It was no night dream; it is between nine and ten o'clock of the\nforenoon. There is the sun shining and silently witnessing the scene from\nabove. I see HIlII before me in flesh and blood; and he speaks to me is\naccents of kindness and gentleness. What more do I want? My excess of\nbappineu made me dumb. Nor was it until a few moments later that I was\ndrawn to utter a few words, encouraged by his gentle tone and speech. His\ncomplexion is not as fair as that of Mahatma Koot Hool'ni; but never have I\nlIeen a countenance so handsome, a stature 80 tall and 80 majestic. As in his\nportrait, he wears a IIhort black beard, and long black hair hanging down to\nhis breast; only his dress was dift'erent. Instead of a white, loose robe he wore\na yellow mantle lined with fur, and on his head, instead of a \"agN, Ii yellow\nTibetan felt cap, as I have seen 80me Bhootanese wear in this country. When\nthe first moments of rapture and surprise were over, and I calmly compre-\nhended the situation, I had a long talk with him. He told me to go no\nfurther, for I would come to grief. He said I should wait patiently if I\nwahted to become an accepted Ollela: that many were those who oft'ered\nthemselves as candidates, but tlmt only 0. very few were found worthy ; none\nwere rejected-but all of them tried, and most found to fail signally,\ne8pecially~d--. Borne, instead of being accepted and pledged this\nyear, were now thrown oft' for 0. year. . . \u2022 . . \u2022 The Mahatma,\nI found, speaks very little English~r at least it 80 seemed to me-antI\n.poke to me in my mother tong_Tamil. He told me that if the 0k0ll6n per-\nmitted Madame Blavatsky to go to Pari-jong next year, then I could come\nwith her. . . . The Beng.uee Theosophists who followed the' Upuika'\n(Madame Blavatsky) would see that she was right in trying to diaauade thelll\nfrom following her now. I asked the blessed Mahatma whether I could tell\nwhat I saw and heard to others. He replied in the affirmative, and that,\nmoreover, I would do well to write to you and describe all. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDigitized by Google\n\f011 Phenomena connected wit\/, TlIeosop\"lI. 36]\n., I must impret18 upon your mind tho whole situation and ask you to keep\nwell in view that what I Stnll was not the Dlere 'appearance' only, the astral\nbody of the Mahatma, as we saw him at Bombay, but the U\",ng man, il& hil,\nOWA physwal bod\". He was pleased to say when [ offered my farewell flamG8-\nkarams (prostration) that he approached the British Territory to see the\nUpasika. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Before he left me, two more men came on horseback, his\nattendants, I suppose, probably Chelal\/, for they were dressed like lama-\ngyUmgIf, and both, like himself, with long hair streaming down their backs.\nThey followed the Mahatma, as he left, at a gentle trot. For over an hour I\nstood gazing at the place that he had just quitted, and then 1 slowly retraced\nmy steps. Now it was that I found for the first time that my long boots 118<1\npinched me in my leg in several pIaces, that I had eaten nothing since the\nday before, and that 1 was too weak to walk further. My whole body was\naching in every limb. At a little distance I saw petty traders with country\nponies, taking burden. I hired one of these animals. In the afternoon I\neame to the Rungit River and crossed it. A bath in its cool waters renovate<l\nme. I purchased some fruits in the only bazaar there and ate them heartily.\nI took another horse immediately and reached Darjeeling late in tlle evening.\nI could neitller eat, norsit, nor stand. Every part of my body waa aching.\nMy absence had seemingly alarmed Madame Blavatsky. She scolded me for\nmy rash and mad attempt to try to go to Tibet after this fashion. When 1\nentered the house I found witll Madame Blal\"atsky, Babu Parbati Chum Roy,\nDeputy Collectorof Settlements and Superintendent of Dcarah Survey, and\nhis Assistant, Babu Kanty Bhushan Sen, both members of our Society. At\ntheir prayer and Madame Blavatsky's command, I recounte<l all that bad\nhappened to me, reserving, of course, my private conversation \\vith the\nMahatma. . . \u2022 They were all, to say the least, astounded! \u2022 \u2022 After\nall, she will not go this year to Tibet; for which I am sure she does not care,\nsince she saw om Masters, tllus effecting her only object.

Apart from this recognition,\npersonation through the agency of the Coulomba would appear to be\npeculiarly easy in this cue.\" Mr. Ramaawamier'a accountof it, in reply to\nmy queations, is u followa :....,.\n\" I had been a member of the Socioty about two montha, when I went to\nthe headquarters at Bombay. After being there 2 or 3 daya, Madame came\nIn to me line monung and said I wu thinking of IOmething apecial, and\nthat she had Muter'a orders to tell me to put it in writing and give it to her.\nI wrote a letter during the day. Madame uked me to accompany her for a\ndrive-llOlnewhere between 6 and 7 p.m. As we went downatairs to get\ninto the carriage, I gave her the letter. She put it into her pocket, and we\nimmediately got into the carriage. We got out at the telegraph-oftico, in\norder that a telegram might be sent to congratulate lOme friends who were\nbeing married. Either the Colonel or Damodar went alone to the te1egraph-\noffice, but not out of my aight.\n\" Madame then said ahe felt the preaence of the Maaters at headquarters,\nand wanted to go back directly. We usually walked up the road towards\nthe house, but on tllia occaaion Madame would not allow us to leave tile\ncarriage. As the carriage neared the portico, I 88W tile figure of a man\nleaning on the railing of the balcony Witll a letter between finger and\nthumb. We all remained motionl888 for a ahort time, the figure on the\nbalcony alao. The letter was then thrown down by the figure. It fell\nnear the carriage, on tlle ground. Colonel Olcott got out and took it up,\nand we all then ran up to the balcony. But no one waa thore. The night.\nwas bright moonlight. The figure wu tall, about 6ft., well-built, and the\nfnce very handsome. Tho eyea were very calm and motionlCII, giving an\naspect of aerenity. The hair wu dark and long, the board was ahort. He\nhad a fehta on his head, and did not apeak. I had never seen tho\nfigure before. Afterwards I recogniaed the reaemblance between thia figure\nand the portrait in poueuion of the Colonel, which I had not previously\naeen.\n\"The letter waa addre880d to me, and containlld words to the effect that.\nevery man mlllt havo his own deaerts, and that if I deserved well of tho\nMahatmaa they would &88ist me; alao that my desire to become a pupil had\nnot been long ill existence, and that I should wait to aoe whether it wa'S a\nmere paaaing thought or not. (In my letter I had exprelled a desire,\namong other things, to beoome a pupil.) This was the whole substance of\nthe letter, in my own word.. Time-betweon 7 and 8 p.m.\"\nDuring my examillation of Madanlo Blavataky, concerning some of the\nletters in Madante Coulomb'. pamphlet, Colonel Olcott gave an RCCOunt of\nthe letter which Mr. Ramuwamier had given to Madame Blavataky.\nDigitized by Google\n\f0\" Phellomella connected rei\/II. T!leo80}JhU. 363\nAcconling to his account, )OIr. RamasW&lUicr gave the letter to Madame\nBlavatsky in her own rooms, shortly before dinner. The letter was\npln.ced by her on the table, and in a few minutes, on looking for it, it could\nnot be found. Madame Blavatsky confirmed this account; Mr. Damodar\nalso Bl8ented to it. Madame Blavatsky was alone with Mr. Ramaswamier at\nthe time, but Colonel Olcott and Mr. Damodar professed to have heanl the\ndotails shortlyafter.\nI asked Madame Coulomb if she kllew anything of this letter. She said\nthat Madame Blavatsky retired to the bath-room, where she (Madame\nCoulomb) was; that Madame Blavatsky was in a great hurry, saying\n\" Quick! Quick! \" and wrote the reply in a few seconds, which she gave to\nMadame Coulomb, to be dropped by M. Coulomb disguised as a Mahatma.\nThere was ample time for M. Coulomb to have doffed. his disguise,\nand to be found reading \" a short distance from the balcony,\"\nand I may remark that an expression used by Mr. Ramaswamier\nseema to me especially applicable to the eyes of a dummy head, like that\nexhibited to me by M. Coulomb. \"The eyes were very calm and motion-\nless, giving an aspect of serenity.\" The\" Mahatma\" communication is\ndescribed as .. written in Thibetan characters,\" and Mr. Hume has informed\nme that he ascertained that Madame Blavatsky had some knowledge of\nThihetan, though how far her knowledge extends he was unable to say, not\nbeing himself a Thibetan scholar.\nI have had many conversations with Mr. Ramaswamier, and I questioned\nhim closely concenling the .. Mahatma\" he saw on the bonlers of Thibet.\nA loose robe covered most of the Mahatma's body. The feet and legs were\nnot bare. The foet were enveloped in a sort of leather used in that district.\nThe Mahatma talked to him for about half-an-hour, spoke to him of Chelas\nwho had failed, of the duties of a Chela,-told him he should work for the\nTheosophical Society, and gaye him certain communications by which per-\nIOns in high standing in thll Society could be Bl8ured he had seen the Master\nhin1self. Among these persons was Colonel Olcott, and I understood that the\nknowledge communicated implied something equivalent to a passwonl.\nMr. Ramaswamior could not describe the Chelas, who passed quickly on\nhorseback.\nI see no improbability in supposing that the Mahatma was personated by\none of Madame Blavatsky's confederates, and it is not impossible that Mr.\nBabajee and Mr. Casava PiUai may have been concerned in the scheme, as\nMadame Coulomb implies in her pamphlet. They are both familiar with\ndistricts where Tamil is commonly spoken. Mr. Babajee had not been\naccused of actually playing the Mahatma on that occasion, but he was\nnevertheless particularly anxious to prove to me how absunl it was that he,\nthe little Mr. Babajee, could be mistaken for a majestic Mahatma. Mt.\nCasava Pillai, who had been on a contemporaneous visit to the North, I\nhave not had an opportunity of cross-examining; but I obtained incidentally\nsome curious'infonnation from Mr. Muruganunthum Pillai, who was present\nwhen Madanle Blavatsky was conversing witll his brollier-in-law, Mr.\nCasava., after the latter's return from tho North and when he was on a visit\nto Madras. Madame Blavatsky had \"chaffed\" Mr. Casava Pillai 011 the\n1081 of his beard. t:pon inquiry I learnt that Mr. Casava Pillai habitually\n2 A !!\nDigitized by Google\n\f.Appendices to Mr. HOdg8M'8 Report\nwore no beard; he seeml, therefore, to have temporarily acquired a beard\nin the coune of hia joumey north! Mr. Damodar, who wall prelent when I\nwu queetioning Mr. Murugonunthum Pillai, wu evidently diaconcertecl\nwhen thia piece of luggeetive convereation wu innocently reproduced by the\nwitn811. It appeared to UI in our Fil'llt Report that\" hallucination\" would\nbe an euier hypotheeia to apply to Mr. Ramuwamier'l experience\nthan \"peJ'lOnation\"; but my acquaintance with Mr. Ramaewamier, taken\nwith the evidence for the reverence diaplayed by the nativee towarde the\n\"Mahatmu,\" which would interfere with any careful acrutiny, baa\nconvinced me that he might eaeily have been deceived by a confederate of\n. Madame Blavataky's in disguiae.\nAPPENDIX IX.\nEVIDENOE OF MR. MARTANDIU.O n. NAGNATH, d\"t'.\nFrom\" Hinta on Esoteric TheOl<lphy,\" No.1, p. 103.\n\"On another night a Brother came in hia own physical body, walking\nthrough the lower garden (attached to Colonel Olcott's bungalow) and stood\nquiet.

On a sudden, at about 10 or 11 at night;, a white\nclad figure was coming through the garden from the brow of the bill [down\nwhich, Colonel Olcott interposed, there was no path leading to the\ncommon road at the foot].\n\" The figure wore a fehta, seemed rather tall, and bad a beard. I could\nsee the man clearly, and could distinguish biB features, but did not know\nhim. He came fast walking towarda us. When he came within 6 or '1\nyarde of us, Madame went down the wooden staircaae, and met the figure\nand appeared to shake banda with him. I saw a packet delivered by the\nfigure to Madame. After BOmc minutes' talk with the figure Madame\nremounted the staircase with the packet in her band, and told us to go into\nthe bungalow and shut the door. We went inside, clOBed the door, and sat\non a couch close to the right of the door. We heard Madame talking oublide,\nbut we did not know the language. It was not French or Engliah. After\nlOme minutes Madame came in and showed us the packet. The packet was\nintact;, and bad three postal marks, Calcutta, Allahabad, and Bombay.\n[Interrupted by Colonel Olcott, who persuaded him there were only two\npostmarks.] One stamp was triangular,-Allahabad. These postmarks were\nof the same date. The letter was without anyaddreu. H WM opened in our\npresence. Madame read the letter. I believe it was from Mr. Sinnett. It\ncame from Allahabad.\"\nColonel Olcott, who WM pre8ent at this interview with Mr. Martandrao,\nsaid there was no path leading from the brow of the hill to the common road\nat the foot. I found, however,that therewere two such paths, which appeared\nto be very old, and which I definitely ascertained were in existence when\nCrow's Neat Bungalow formed the headquarters of the Society. Moreover,\nI found upon trial that the bill could be ascended where no path had\nbeen made.\nIn Mr. Martandrao's oral account there appears to be BODle confusion\nbetween the incident quoted above from .. Hint-. on Esoterio Theosophy,\"\nand a different incident, of which the account previously given by Mr.\nMartandrao in the same pamphlet, p. 1~, is as follows :-\n\"In the month of April, 1881, on one dark night, while talking in\ncompany with other Theosophist-. with Madame Blavataky about 10 p.m. in\nthe open verandah of the upper bungalow, a man, 6 feet in height;, clad in\na white robe, with a white roolHal or phetta on the head, made biB appuarance\non a sudden, walking towards us througb the garden adjacent to tbe bungalow\nfrom a point-a precipice-where there is no path for anyone to tread,\nMadame tben roae up and told us to go inside the bungalow. So we went\nin, but we heard Madame and he talking for a minute with each other in an\nEastern language unknown to us. Immediately after, we again went oue\ninto the verandah, as we were called, but the Brother bad disappeared.\"\nThe same abaurd statement that there was no path occurs in this account\nalso. Mr. Martandrao (Clerk in Examiner's Office of Public Acco\\mt-.~\nDigitized by Google\n\f366 Appmaice6 to Hr. Hoc\/U60,,'6 Report\nBombay,) is, I believe, a very honest witness, though not gifted with a great\namount of shrewdness, and not able to describe bis experiences with any\nfluency in English. It was quite impouible for him to have written the\naccount of his experiences, as it stands above his name in .. Hinte on Esoteric\nTheosophy.\" Colonel Olcott in my preaence has corrected\u00b7-as to absurd or\nfaulty expressions-the written accounte of witnesses; and he may have\nen'Oneously .. corrected\" Mr. Martandrao's account in the above particular\nconcerning the path, just as he made the addendum when Mr. HartandJ.'lV)\nwas giving the oral account to myself. The reader will see that either\naccount is perfectly valueless for proving that the figure was other than an\nordina.ry man,-unless the brow of the hill,acceuibJe without difficulty on the\nfarther side beyond the observation of the witn_, were first traneformed\nineo the sumlwt of R pathleu precipice. I may here say that the grounds\nwhich form the environment of Crow's Neat Bungalow, with their many\npaths and easy hiding-p1acea, formed all admirable stage for the display\nof \"astral figures,\" which appear to have been seen much more frequently at\nCrow's Neat Bungalow than elsewhere. The next account is interesting in\nthe \".ay of suggesting exactly how the .. astral figures\" were pre-arra.nged\nin that partioular cue for the purpose of enabling the witneB8eB to testify to\nthe existence of the \" Brothen.\"\nML MARTANDRAo'~ Aocount published in \"Hinte on Esoterio Theosophy,\"\np. 105. .\n\" Similarly, in a strong moonlight on another night, I, in company with\nthree Brother Theosophists, was convening with Madame Blavatsky.\nMadame Coulomb was also present. About 8 or 10 yards distant from\nthe open verandah in which we were sitting, we saw a Brother known to us\nas Koot Hoomi Lal Sing. He was wearing a white loose goWII or robe, with\nlong wavy hair and a beard ; and was gradually forming, lUI it were, in front\nof a shrub or a number of shrubs some 20 or 30 yards away from us.\nuntil he stood to a full height. Madame Coulomb was asked in our presence\nby Madame Blavateky: 'Is this good Brother a devil 1\u2022 as she used to think\nand say 80 when seeing the Brothen, and was afraid. She then answered:\n'No; tltis one is a man.' He then showed his full figure for about 2\nor 3 minutes, then gradually disappe3red, melting away into the shrub.\nOn the same night again. at about 11 p.m., we, about '1 or 8 in\nnumber, were hearing a letter read to us, addreued to the London Spiritual..\nabout our having seen Brotben, which one of our number had drafted, and\nwhich wa were ready to sign. At this instant Mr. and Madame Coulomb\ncalled out and said: 'Here is again our Brotlter.' This Brother (Koot\nHoomi Lal Sing again) was sometimes standing and walking in the garden\nhere and there, at other times floating in the air. He soon paased into and\nwas heard in Madame Blavateky's room talking with her. On this account,\nafter we had signed the letter to the London Spiritual\"t, we added a poetecript\nthat we had just seen him again while signing the letter. Koot Hoomi was\nin his Mayawi t'Upa on that evening.\"\nMr. Marta,&t.i.\"aO\" accot,nt in reply to my ilt'l\"irki :-\"At about '1 or 8\np.m., in Bombay headqusrten-it was eitlter in 1881 or 1882-we were\nsitting in the verandah upstain, Bhavani Shankar, Padsbah (elder brother\nof Padshah in England), Madame, Mulwarman NathwaI'mnn, and Damooar.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn Phenomena connected tC;t'~ ne080))\"!!. 367\nWe were talking together when Madame suddenly became abstracted. She\ngot up and went to the railing, and stood looking towards the sea. We\nthoughtsomething would happen. Madame told us to go on talking; then she\nsat down. Again we were talking. Again she stood up ; and at once we also\nstood up, and saw a figure in the garden among the shrubs, about 30 yards off,\non the brow of the hill. It was moonlight, and the moonlight shone upon the\nfigure. I saw first half a figure, and then a full figure approaching a few\nsteps, then standing. Then the figure seemed gradually to melt away.\nWhile this figure was standing, Madame sent for Madame Coulomb from\ndownstains, as she was always saying the place was haunted by devils.\nMadame Coulomb came, and was told to look at the figure, and Madame\nBlavataky &eked in a challenging tone, \u2022Is that the devil, 01' a man l'\nShe said quiatIy, 'This is a man, not a dovil.' The figure was very tall,\n51 or 6 feet. The figure had on a lOOle white gown, and wore a beard. I\ndo not now recollect whether tile figure had a turban, or not. I did not\nrecognise the person as one whom I had known before. The figure remained\n7 or 8 minutes.\n\"We went on again talking, alld at 9 or 9.30 we went into another\nverandall, and Damodar and Padahah drafted a reply to be sent to the news-\npaper Light. After about 10 or 12 lines of the draft were written, 3 or 4:\npersons signed. The reat were to sign, and as we were called to sign we\nwere told to read the draft. While reading, our attention was drawn by\nM. Coulomb, who had conle up, to a figure standing iD the garden. At that\ntime the moon had gone. We went from the table to the Vonetian\nwindows facing towards tile sea, and I saw a figure in the garden, while\nM. Coulomb and others were standing near me. The figure in the garden\nwas tall, about 6 feet, standing erect and majestically, with a gown on,\nwearing a. beard, but was not so robust as the previous figure, a.nd with a\nfehta on his head. Towards that figure I folded my hands in reverence,\nthinking it to be a Mahatma. The figure stood for 4: or 5 minutes, a.t\nabout 12 yards distance, a.nd I then began to talk with those near me, and\nsuddenly heard Madame's servant, Babula, shouting from the bungalow.\nMadame went in haste to the porch, and thence to her own room. I tIleIi\nheard Mada.me talking with somebody. When I heard Babula IIhout, 1\nlooked up again for the figure, and it was no longer there. Padahah and\nDamodar suggested that as we saw the figure while we were about to sign\nthe protest we should add a postscript to that effect. We accordingly\ndid BO.\"\nWith these accountB may be comp&l'ed the following :-\nAccount by MR, BHAVANI RAo (SHAlIo\"JtAR) printed in a compilation by Dr.\nHartmann in 1885.\n\" In a bright moonlight, on tJle night of the 13th July, 1881, we were\nengaged in a talk with Madame Blavataky as usual in the same verandall.\nM. Coulomb and Madame Ooulomb were present on the spot, as also\nall the persona of the house, and Madame BlavatBky's servant. While we\nwere conversing with Madame BlavatBky, the Mahatma, known as Mr.\nSinnett's correspondent and the Author of tIle letters published in \u2022TIle\nOccult World,' made Ilis appearance in his Mayari TlIpa or 'Double,'\nDigitized by Google\n\f368 .Ap?llcliccs to Mr. 9OOg80\/l'8 Rl'}Jort\nfor a few minutes. He was clad in the white dre88 of a 'Punjabee' and\nwore a white turban. All of those who were present at that time saw his\nhandsome features clearly and distinctly, as it was a bright moonlight night.\nOn the same night, a letter was drafted to the London Spiritttalilit about\nour having seen the Mahatmas. As we were reading the letter in question,\nthe same Mahatma showed himself again. TIle second time when he made\nhis appearance, he was very near us, say at the distance of a yard or two.\nAt that time, M. and Madame Ooulomb said, 'Here is our Brother,'\nmeaning the Mahatma. He then came into Madanle Blavatsky's room and\nwas heard t!Uking with her and then disappeared. M. Ooulomb and\nMadame Coulomb signed the letter drafted to the London Spiri.fAtalilt\ntestifying to the fact of their having seen the 'Mahatma.' Since Madame\nCoulomb now says that the Mahatmas are but 'cl'8fty arrangements of\nmualin and bladden,' and her husband represented the Mahatmas, how are\nwe to reconcile this statemont witIl the fact that in the London 8pirituali\"t\nof tlle 19th August, 1881, appeared a letter signed by five witn088es, in-\ncluding myself, testifying to the fact of their havingseen a Mahatma, while\nthey were writing that let~r; and that this document is signed by botIl the\nCoulombs 1 There is, t.herefore, no doubt that they were with the company\nwho signed the paper. Who was it then that appeared on that occasion as\na Mahatma 1 Surely neitIler M. and Madame Coulomb witll their\n'muslin and bladden,' nor Madame Blavatsky's servant, who was also\npresent, but the 'double' of a person living on the otIler side of the\nHimalayas. The figure in coming up to Madame Blavatsky's room was seen\nby us 'to float through the air,' and we also distinctly heard it talking to\nher, while all of us, inclu{liug her servant and tile Coulomb\", were at the\ntime, together, in e&eh other's presence.\"\nNow witIl regard to the statement of Mr. Bhavani, who apparently cama\nhis living as an official of the Theosophical Society, being Inspector of tlll~\nN. W. Theosophical branches, I may remark that the figure in question,\nalthough neither M. nor Madame Coulomb, nor Madanle Blavatsky'a\n8Orvant, may still have been a confederate in disguise. It does, illdee-l,\nappear somewhat odd that .. all tho persons of tIle house, and Madame\nBlavatsky's servant\" should be .. present on tIle spot\" with tIlose Theoso-\nphists who weN .. engaged in a talk witIl Madame Blavatsky,\" and it is\nrather unfortunate that tltis fact or fancy was 110t exhibited more clearly\neither in the document forwarded to 2'h~ Spiritllalilt or in the account given\nsoon afterwards (February, 1882) by Mr. Martandrao. A reference to The\nSpilittlaliat of August 19t11, 1881, will show that tlle Coulombs sigued Oldy\n'he poatacript, which runs as follows: \"As we were reading the foregoing\nover, a Brotller was witIl us. M. and Madame Coulomb, tlle latter\nAssistant Corresponding Secretary of the Central Theosophical Society, have\nseou him alld will testify to the same.\" Then comes tIle statement:\n., The above postscript is correct,\" which is signed by the Coulombs.\nObviously, this postscript proves only that the Coulombs were witIl the\nother witn088es when the alleged apparition was seen the ~cond time. But\nthis has never been denied by the Coulombs. M. Couloinb a88erts that he\nappeared fint disguised as a Mahatma, that then a letter was drafted to\nbe sent to The ~iritualist, and that afterwards Babula appeared disguised\nDigitized by Google\n\f\/\n011 PI,CIUJIIUma COllllccted with TI.eo80pk!l. 369\nas a Mahatma, fOl' the PUl\"}>ose of enabling botll tIle Coulombs to be pre-\nsent witIt the other witneasea, and to add tIteir testimony. These aasertions\nare entirely in harmony, not only with tIte document printed in The Spiri-\ntualist, but also with tIte detailed accounts of tIte two alleged .. astral ..\nappearances given by Mr. Martancirao, in whose earlier account it is\nplainly enough implied that M. Coulomb was not present with tile otIter\nwitnesses when the first figure was seen, and that Babula might have been\nabsent from the company the whole evenillg. His later account confirms\nhis earlier one in these particulars, and appears to me to be further cor-\nroborative of M. Coulomb's aasertions. I think it, tIterefore, highly probable\nthat tIte appearances were produced in the way .described by M. Coulomb,\nand I cannot myself resist the impreaaion that the important and palpable\ndiscrepancies between the accounts given by Mr. Bhavani and Mr. Mar-\ntandrao are due to deliberate falsification on the part of Mr. Bhavani.\nAPPENDIX X.\nALLEGED ASTRAL APPARITION WITNESSED BY MR. AND MRS.\nROSS SCOTT. REMARKABLE PORTRAITS\u2022\n.. Hints on Esoteric Theosophy,\" No.1, pp. 75, 76.\n\"The undersigned severally certify that, in each otIter's presence, tI10Y\nrecently saw at tIte headquarters of the Theosophical Society\" (at Bombay)\n.. a BrotIter of the Firat Section, known to tItem under a name which they\nare not at liberty to communicate to the public. The circumstances were of\na nature to exclude all idea of trickery or collusion, and were as follows:-\n\"We were sitting together in the moonlight about 9 o'clock upon the\nbalcony which projects from the front of tIte bungalow. Mr. Scott was\nsitting facing the house, so as to look through the intervening verandah and\nthe library, and into the room at the furtlter side. Tllia latter apartment\nwas brilliantly lighted.\n\"The library was in partial darkneaa, thus rendering objects in the\nfarther room more distinct. Mr. Scott suddenly saw tIte figure of a man\nstep into the space, opposite the door of the library; he was clad in tIte\nwhite dreaa of a Rajput, and wore a white turban. Mr. Scott at once recog-\nnised him from his resemblance to a portrait in Colonel Olcott's poaaeaaion.\nOur attention was tIten dmwn to him, and we all saw him most distinctly.\nHe walked towards a table, and afterwards turning his face towards u,\nwalked back out of our sight. We hurried forward to get a closer view, in\nthe hope that he nlight also speak ; but when we reached the room he was\ngone. We cannot say by what means he departed, but that he did not pass\nout by tile door which leads into the compound we can positively affirm ; for\nthat door was full in our view, and he did not go out by it. At tIte side of\nthe room towards which he walked there was no exit, the only door and the\ntwo windows in that direction having been boarded and closed up. Upon\nthe table, at the spot where he had been standing, lay a letter addressed to\none of our number. The handwriting was identical with tllat of sundry\nnotes and letters previously received from hun in divers ways-8uch as\nDigitized by Google\n\f370 Appf!Jldiccs to MI'. Hodgson's Rrpol't\ndropping down from the ceiling, &c. ; the signature was the same as that of\nthe other letters received, antI as that upon the portrait above described.\nHis long hair was black, and hung down upon his breast; his features and\ncomplexion were those of a Rajput.\n..

Personation does not seem impossible\nin this case, considering the distance, and that there may have been modes\nof ingress to the room known only to the Coulombs. Still lesa does it seem\nimp088ible that it can have been the real man in the flesh.\" That it was\na case of personation I have now no doubt.\nc\n)(\nv\n\\\nB\nThe accompanying rough skereh will\nexplain the position.\nM. Coulomb asserts that he played the\n:Mahatma on this occasion. He explained\ntl me that the door leading from the\nverandah (V) into the library (L) was an\nordinary double one, and so, likewise, was\nthe door leading from the library into\nColonel Olcott's office (0), where the figure\nappeared; but the door leading from the\noffice into the compound (C) was a quad.\nruple one. The line' of sight from the\nposition occupied by the party on the\nbalcony (B) did not permit the tohole of\nthe quadruple.door exit to be seen, and by\nthe time the party had reached such a\nposition as to see the whole space of ezit,\nM. Coulomb bad left the room by the\nfurther side part of the quadruple-door.\nOne side of the door leading from the\nlibrary into the office, M. Coulomb deelares\nbe had pushed partly to, in order to make\ncertain that bis departure should not he\nobserved.\nI perfonned this manreuvre myself ill\nBombay, and it succeeded admirably.\nWitb the door pushed partly to, as repre\u00b7\nsented in tbe diagram, it was not posaible\nfor the party, who were originally on the balcony, to have seen the llOint of\nM. Coulomb's alleged exit before reaching the spot marked P. I requested\na gentlelnan to walk in the direction indicated by the arro~ed line. and\nfound that the illusion was naturally produced that he had contmued to walk\n\fOil Pl,enomena cOlillected feifl. TlIeoaop\"!I. 371\ntowards X, and could not have passed into the compound. Walking thUI\ninto the compound myself, I found it especially convenient to keep my face\nturned towards the spectators, as this enabled me to tell exactly when I\nwas beyond their line of sight, and 80 make my exit unseen. And this just\nanswers to the peculiar description of the disappearance of the figure given\nin the aboloe account. \"He walked towards a table, and afterwards turning\nhis face towards us, walked back out of our sight.\" M. Coulomb's asser-\ntions, then, were so entirely corroborated by my inspection of the place, as\nto make it highly probable that he personsted the Mahatma in the manner\nhe alleges.\nMr. Sinnett, in giving some additional infonnation to Mr. Hume coli-\ncoming the above incident shortly after its occurrence, writes truly that\n\"the force of the incident tums on the arrangement of the rooms;\" and\nproceeds to give a sketch of the reoms. This sketch affords another illustra-\ntion of the remark which I have made in dealing with \"The Occult World\"\nphenomena-that Mr. Sinnett has not exerciseil by any means sufficient care\nin his inveatiption. The most important point in the arrangement of the\nrooms is entirely overlooked by him, the exit into the compound being\nrepresented as no wider than the doorway from the library into the office.\nIn Mr. Sinnett's sketch, the three doorways appear to be all of the same\n. ,\n8lZe. .\nI may here draw attention to a certificate, a copy of which was sent by\nColonel Olcott to Mr. Myers in October of last year:\n[Copy.]\n\"Colonel Olcott baving to-day shown us a portrait in oils, we at once\nrecognised it as a very good likeness of a form which, in January, 1882, we\nsaw at the headquarters of the Theosophical Society in Bombay, and !laid to\nbe that of one of the Mahatmas known as the teacher of Madame Bl~vatsky\nand Colonel Olcott. .\n\" (Sgd.) Ross SCOTT\n\"(Bengal Civil Service).\n\"(Sgd.) MARIA J. B. SCOTT.\n\" Bonn, Gennany, 21th September, 1884.\"\nThis refers to a portrait painted by Mr. Schmiechen from a photograph\nalleged to represent Mahatma M. The features of Malmtma M. originated,\nI believe, with an artist in America. It appears that this gentleman was ra-\nquested to draw a typical Hindu head. He did so, and Madame Blavatsky\ndeclared thatit was the portrait of Mahatma ll. It was Gilt.\u00b7 thi, occutn,1.U\nthat the figure whOle features resembled thOle of the \"fancy portrait,\"\nappllared to Colonel Olcott in New York. Photographs were taken from\nthis \"fancy portrait,\" and it was either from one of these\nphotographa, or from the original portrait tImt Mr. Schmiechen's\npainting was made. I have compared the photograph sid\" by lide with Mr.\nSchmiechen's painting, and must certaiuly l3y that there is a cloBe\nresemblance between the two. Considering then that the dummy head with\nits equipment of turban, &c., was made up to resemblo the early po,trait,\nit is no~ surprising that a painting made from the same original sh(\\uld seem\nDigitized by Google\n\f372 Appc-lIdice8 to Nr. Hodgson'8 Report\nto Mr. and Mrs. RoBS ScoU a good likeness of the diaguiaed figure which\nthey saw in Bombay between two and three years previoualy-and at a\ndistance from them which I concluded when I was at Crow's Nest Bungalow,\nwas probably about 20 paces.\nMr. Schmiechen has also painted a portrait of K. H.. which appeal'll\nto me to resemble his painting of Mahatma M. more nearly than\nit resembles the portrait of K. H. which was formerly kept in the\nShrine. The Shrine-portrait and Mr. Schmiechen's cannot both be\nstriking likeneBSea of K. H. ; they would probably be taken by any ordinary\nobserver to represent different persons. In the Shrine-portrait, which ia\nalleged, I think, to have been the work of some Chela(and if so, was pro-\nbably the work of Madame Blavatsky), the nOle is much more aquiline, and\nthe eyes more .almond-shaped than in Mr. Schmiechen's painting. The\nexpreBSion of the eyes, moreover, is very different from t!lat in Mr.\nSchmiechen's rendering, and the complexion is very much paler. Alao the\nhair is decidedly curly in the Shrine portrait, but is not curly in Mr.\nSchmiechen's. I drew Colonel Olcott's attention to the lack of resemblance\ndisplayed in some of these resll8Cts, and he admitted that tliere was a\ndifference, which he described as being such as one would expect between\nthe attempt of a schoolboy and that of a finished artist. As for the hair, he\nsaid that \"Hair gets much straighter when it is wet\" :\nIn connection with these portraits, 1 may refer to another, alleged to\nhave been prOOuced by Madame Blavatsky in leBS than a minute, in America.\nIt appeared to us, at the time of our Firat Report, that there was no proof\nthat the portrait, said to represent a Hindu Fakir, might not have been\nmade previously; but the case seemed to be of lome interest in consequence\nof the artistic merits of the picture attested to by Mr. O'Donovan and Mr.\nI.e Clear (vide\" Hints on Esoteric Theosophy,\" No.1, pp. 85, 86). Mr.\u00b7\nO'Donovan, in tho statement wlUch he made concerning the portrait, said\nthat \"the black tints seem to be all integral part of the paper upon which\nit is done.\" Mr. I.e Clear said: \"I first tllOUght it chalk, then pencil, then\nIndian ink; but a minute inspection leaves me quite unable to decide.\nCertainly it is neither of the above\" ; and also: ., The tint seems not to be\nlaid 011 the surface of the common writing-paper upon which the portrait is\nmade, but to be combined, as it were, with the fibres themselves.\" I think\nit is implied hy the statement of Mr. O'Donovan that the lighter tints\nappeared to have beell laid 011, and Ilot to fomi an integral part of the pal>er,\nand this apl>eared also to myself. Madame Coulomb alleged that Madame\nBlavatsky had told her that she had laid on the upper tints herself upon one\nof two l>hotographs of a Hindu Fakir which she poBSeBSed, and Madanle\nCoulomb further alleged that the other photograph was still in one of\nMadame Blavatsky's albums, and that I would, without doubt, be able to\nsee the portrait in the album, and reco2llise the likeneBS to the one s\"pposed\nto have been produced by occult methods. I fllund a portrait which I thought\nmight be the counterpart; it was different from an ordinary photograph, the\nsurface not presenting a polisho<1 appearance, and it seemed to me to\nresemble rather a mezzotint engraving. I had no opportunity of comparing\nit aide by side with the ., phenomenal\" portrait, which I had not seen for\nsome time previously ; and all I can say is that I noted a cOllsiderable\nDigitized by Google\n\fOil Phl'11011U'lia CO\/IJUJctcdlrith Theo8oph!l. 373\nt:esemblance about tlle eyes and forehead wllicll led me to think it quite\npossible that the .. phenomenal\" portrait may have been the result of\nMadame Blavateky's artistic skill exercised upon a portrait like the one I\nfound in her albl1\\u.\nAPPENDIX XI.-(Vide p. 248.)\n1\nOn tlle 4th Marcll, l~Madame Blavateky and Colonel Olcott were\nat this time on the ocean, having left Bombay on February 20tll for\nMarseilles)-I, owing to certain domestic a1Hictions, felt exceedingly\nmiserable ; could not take a morsel of food ; and remained in the most\nwretched condition of mind all that day. But ill the evening, between 5\nand 6 p.m., I proceeded to Adyar, in the hope of finding some consolation\nthere; and was seated in the office-room of the headquarters, talking to\nllr. Bawaji, without, however, mentioning to any body the circumstance of\nmy being in an unhappy condition. In the meantime, Mr. Damodar stepped\nill; and I at once expressed to him my desire to see the ,. Shrine.\" He very\nkindly conducted me to the Occult Room upalmira forthwitll; and unlocked\nthe \" Shrine.\" He and I were standing hardly five seconds looking at the\nMahatma K. H.'s portrait in the .. Shrine,\" when he (Mr. Damodu) told me\nthat he had orders to close the \" Shrine ;\" and did so immediately. This\ncourse was extremely disappointing to me, wllo, as the reader will have per-\nceived from the above, ,vas sorely in need of some consolation or other at\nthat time. But ere I could realise the pangs of tllis disappointment, Mr.\nDamodar re-opened in an instant the \"Shrine\" by orders. My eye imme-\ndiately fell upon a letter in a Thibetall envelope in the cup in the\" Shrine,\"\nwhich was quite empty before I I ran and took the letter, and finding that\nit was addressed to me by Mahatma K. H., I opened and read it. It con-\ntained very kind words conveying consolation to my aching heart; advising\nme to take courage; explaining how the laws of Karma were inevitable; and\nfinally referring me to Mr. Damodar for further explanation of certain\npassages in the letter.\nHow my presence before his portrait attracted the instantaneous notice\nof the Mahatma, being thousands of miles oft'; how the Mahatma divined\nthat I was miserable and was in need of comfort at Ilia hands ; how he pro-\njected his long and consoling letter from such great distance into the closed\ncabinet, within the twinkling of an eye j and, above all, how solicitous he,\nthe great Mahatma, is for the well-being of mankind, and more especially\nof persons devoted to him,-are pointe which I leave to the sensible reader\nto consider and profit by. Enough to say that this unmistakable sign of\nextraordinary kindness on the part of the great Master armed me with suffi-\ncient energy to shake oft' the miserable and gloomy thoughte, and filled my\nheart with unmixed comfort and excessive joy, coupled with feelings of the\nsincerest gratitude to the benevolent Mahatma for this blessing.\nP.

P. IYALOO NAIDU.\n(A reply to Mr. Myers' inquiry contained in his letter of 13th ultimo.)\nOn the 11th February last, I received a letter from Mr DanlOdar K.\nMavalankar, dated 8th idem, Adyar. In it there was a meuage in pencil by\nMahatma Koot Hoomi, regarding a very important point.\nOn the same day, viz., 11th February, I received another envelope by\nthe same post, \"From Bhola Deva Sarma,\" in which there was a Thibetan\nenvelope containing a measage in Teloogoo chamcters on a point very impor-\ntant to me, with the initials of our revered Guru Deva M.C.\nIn the llUlt mouth (August) I was anxious about my journey to this\ncountry from Hyderabad, and often thought of the Mahatma M. C. About\nthe 26th idem I examined my clothes, &c., at Hyderabad, and found the\ninitials of the Mahatma M. C. on a cap which I use during my meditation.\nP. lYALOO NAIDU, F.T.S.,\nPensd. Dep. Collector, Amee.\n19th September, 1884.\nIII reply IQ tny allql,iriu :-Mr. Naidu had sent a letter to Mahatma M.,\nthrough Damodar. About 10 days after, on February 11th, he received a\nletter from Damodar, who said he had\" missed\" the letter (i.e., that he had\nplaced it for the Mahatma to take, and that it had gone), that Mahatma M.\nhad taken it and would attend to it. On the same day Mr. Naidu received a\nletter from Mount Road (nearly four miles from the Theosophical head-\nquarters), .. From Bhola Deva Sanna.,\" 8uppo8ed Chela of Mahatma M.\nThe cap refelTCd to had been given to him by Colonel Olcott about 20\nmonth8 previously. The cap had been wonl several times during this\ninterval by Mr. Naidu, who had been staying at Hyderabad the whole time.\nThe initial8 appear as though marked with a blue pencil, and Mr. Naidu\nhimself 8Uggested that he should ask Colonel Olcot.t if the initials were there\nwhen he received the cap. He thought it poasible the initials might have\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn P\"tIlOnlCllfJ cOllllcclccl u:ith TllC08op\/1!\/. 375\nbeen there without his observing them. His sight is not good, and he had\nnever specially examined the cap, which Ulay bo described as a smoking-cap\nmade of white soft fabric. The colour of the initiala is not deep, and\nappears to have sufferdd the wearing away due to friction.\nWhen we issued our Firat Report, Mr. Naidu's written statement seemed\nto have some interest on account of the use of Teloogoo characters in th.\nMahatma document, but assuming that Madame Blavatsky has native con-\nfederates, it is obvious that no importance can be attributed to their usc.\nMr. Babajee, however, in reply to my questions, said that he did not think\nanyone at headquarters knew Teloogoo, \"except it be Damodar,\" but when\nI pushed my inquiry further, he said with SOUle hesitation that he thought\nthat Mr. Damodal' alao was ignorant of Teloogoo. The Teloogoo may have\nbeen written by Mr. Babajee hinllOlf. Some writing in English, alleged to\nhave been precipitated by \"Bhola Deva Sanna,\" showed clear traces ofMr.\nBabajee's handiwork. (See Part II. of Report.) Another instance had occurred\nwllere a Bombay Theosophist had received a phenomenal communication in\nthe Mahrathi language; but Mahrathi is Mr. Damodar's vernacular. Sanskrit\nknowledge could also be secured, but a question in Hebrew and Arabic\nproved rather too hard a knot fer the Mahatma Brotherhood. Mr.\nDanlodar, when conversing with Madame Blavataky, in my presence, let\nslip the remark-in reference to what he would do on his projected visit.\nto the North-Lhat he would ., first learn Thibetan and Urdu.\" Madame\nBlavataky's quick glance of wanling, Mr. Damodar's diaconcertion, and the\nspecdf change of subject did not lessen the suggestiveness of the utterance.\n-- -- --------\nAPPENDIX XIII.\nThe following accounts will serve to illustrate the quality of many of\nthe letter-phenomena. They were given in reply to my inquiries.\nFALL OF A CALENDAR.\nAccount by MR. T. VIJIARAGHAVA CHARWO (Ananda).\nIn May, 1882, Madame Blavatakyand others came to Nellore. There\nwere more than half-A-dozen of us upataira. No one could remember the\ndate. Madlldlle Blavataky said the Masters could give her a calendar if they\nliked. We were sitting in acircle or semi-circle in front of Madame. She\nshook violently, and a letter struck the wall behind. It was a calendar.\nAccount by MR. DORASWAMY NAIDU.\nWhen we were at Nellore, about midday, in May, 1882, we, Soubbaya\nChetty, myself, Anand&, Madame, and solDe others, were sitting in a room\ntogether ill an upper storey. Madame wanted to know the date. Soubbaya\nChetty gave one date, and another gave a different one. Madame said,\nj, Haven't you got any calendar 1\" The reply was No. Some one asked\nMadame to supply a calendar. Within two or three seconds something fell\nwith a noise on the floor. One of the brothers took the object up.

He wrote a long'letter of 5 or 6 big pages. I\ngave it to Damodar to give to Madame, who returned it to Damodar with\nthe words, \"Answer him as you please.\" Damodar left the letter on the\ntable. Goshi watched it, and answers came to his questions in the letter.\nGoshi was watching the letter all the time.\nAccount by MR. LUKHBMAN N. GOSHI (Pensioned Sub-Judge of Sind).\nI wrote a long letter of several foolscap pages, and gave it, through Mr.\nBrown, to Madame, who gave it to Damodar to get the Master's account.\nDamodar said he left it un the table, and found the writing of Mahatma\nKoot Hoomi in it. He returned it to me.\nMR. NORENDRANUB SEN, editor of the Indiall jIi,.,.o,., did not appear to\nme to have been much impressed by \"phenomena.\" One experience of his\nwas as follows :-\nAt the annh'ersary of 1883, Messrs. Damodar, Muhini, Mullick, BrO\\nl,\nand himself were sitting together wl'en )[r. Damudar asked him if he felt\nanything. The reply was No. Mr. Damudar then said that the Master\ntold Norendra to look in his pocket. He found nothing in his pocket, but\nfound a letter on the seat-from the Mahatma.\nMR. NOBIN KRIBHNA BANNERJEE received a \"phenomenal\" letter'while\nI was at Adyar, but not in my presence. He gave me an account of the\nincident almost immediately afterwards.\nHe had handed some folded manuscript of his own to Mr. Damodar, tAl be\nread through before i1l8ertion in The l'heo.ovhW. Mr. Damodar touk the\nmanuscript, turned over the sheets quickly, said he would read it directly,\nrefolded the manuscript, and placed it on the table. Taking up the manu-\nscript shortly after, it was found that a\" Tibetan\" envelope was lying in the\nfulds, addressed to Harisinghi Rupsinghi in the blue pencil \u00b7writing said tAt\nbe that of Mahatma Koot Hoomi.\nA TEST PHENOMENON!\n\" December 25th.-Grand phenomenon at Shrine: six or seven notes to\ndifferent pers01l8 simultaneously appear in the silver bowl-one in Mahrathi\nto Tookaram, in which his secret name was ,.ritten.\" (Colonel Olcott's diary\nfor 1883.) To the copy I possess of tllis extract, Colonel Olcott has\nappended the following note: \u2022\u2022 A Hindu receives from his Guru, at the\n\u2022 thread ceremony,' when 1\\ boy of about seven, 1\\ mystical name, and this\nlIe always keeps a secret. This test was therefore perfect.\" This note\nof Colonel Olcott's has been erossed through by a pencil by Mr. Danludar,\nwho read through the extracts from Colonel Olcott's diary before they\nwere given to me, and who has substituted the st;\\tement: \" It was a part of\nllia name, but never used by him in c.()rrespondence or anywhere else, and\nth~refore unknown to even his friends.\"\nMr. Tookaram Tatya informed me that the name was his \"surname\" or\n\"family name,\" and he told me at once what it was: Padl!ul.

Mahrathi, as already mentioned,\nis Mr. Damodar's vernacular, and Mr. Damodarhad lived in Bombay previous\nto the removal of the headquarters of the Society to Madras. But the mere\nfact that the knowledge of the family name of a prominent Hindu member\nof the Society has thus come to be chamcterised by Colonel Olcott as a\n.. perfect test,\" is enough in itself to betoken upon what a flimsy fabric of\nevidence his great convictions may rest\u2022\n.GpPENDIX XIV.\nPROFESSOR SMITH'S LETTER SEWN WITH SILK.\nColonel Olcott sta.ted in his deposition that a letter which had been\naddressed by Professor Smith, of Sydney University, to Mahatma M--,\n.. and sent enclosed in a letter to Madame Blavatsky, and which was sewed\nthrough and through many times with silk of different colours, had been\nremoved and another paper substituted inside without the threads having\nbeen broken.\" Madame Coulomb declared to me that it was she herself who,\nwith very great care, and after a long examination of the silk threads,\nunpicked the stitches on one side of the letter and sewed them back by\nmeans of a hair. The \"Mahatma\" enclosure had been inserted, she said, by\nMadame Blavatsky, who had previously read it over to Madame Coulomb,\nand the latter quoted some words which she said had formed part of Mahatma\n1I--'s reply. Madame Coulomb also said that in sewing the stitches back\nahe had pulled the silk somewhat \"tighter\" than it had previol1sly been, in\norder that she might have enough silk to tie the final knot, and as a con-\nsequence, after tying the knot, there were IJ\\)me small ends of silk to spare,\nwhich she cut off, and which she showed to me.\nHaving written to ProfeBBOr Smith on the subject, I received from him a\nletter in which he kindly sent the seWD up note for inspection, and made the\nfollowing statements concenling it:-\n\"It contains the enclosure with which it was returned. I slit\nup the side of the paper to get the enclosure out, after examining\nthe whole carefully with a magnifying glass. I could believe that\nMadame Coulomb unpicked the silk and restored it again only if I saw\nher do it. Observe how closely the ends were cut off so as to leave nothing\nto hold by. . \u2022 . . Madame Coulomb's partial knowledge of the writing\non the enclosure goes for little, as I described it all in a letter to Madame\nBlavatsky.\"\nI examined the sewn-up note, and observed that the threads on one side had\nbeenclearlypulled tighter than those of the other aide, and also that the silk of\nthe more tightly pulled stitches had been handled more than the silk of the\notherside, as was manifest by its peculiar frayed appearance. Apart from theBe\nsigna, my examination of the note left me without any doubt that the\nopening and reclosing of it, as described by Madame Coulomb, were far from\nbeing impossible. I was desirous, however, of clearly establishing whether\nthe note could be so opened and closed or not, but as the operation demanded\n2 B\nDigitized by Google\n\f378 .A.ppelUlice8 to Nr. Hodgson'8 Report\na certain 80rt of delicate care in which I might prove deficient, I ret{uested\nMrs. Sidgwick to undertake the task.\nAccount by Mas. SIDGWICL\nMr. Hodg80n brought me a let~er which Professor Smith of Sydney had\nsent to Madame Blavatsky to be delivered to Mahatma M--. This letter\nhad boen carefully folded up, and the edges doubled over I\\Ild sewn down\nwith red and yellow Hoas silk. It was returned by Madame Blavatsky\napparently intact, but on cutting opep one side, without interfering with the\nsilk, Profeaaor Smith found inside a note purporting to come from the\nMahatma. This note conld not, I think, have got there by natural\nmeans unleas the sewing had boen unpicked at one end. Madame Coulomb\naaaerted, 80 Mr. Hodgson told me, that she had unpicked the silk at one\nend, and sewn it up again by means of a hair. Profeaaor Smith did not\nthink this poasible, and Mr. Hodgson wished me to repeat tho operation,\nwhich Madame Coulomb aaaerted that she had performed, with a view to\nascertaining its poaaibility.\nI thought I could detect slight signa of Madame Coulomb's operations at\none end of the folded paper, and as she said that in sewing it up again she\nhad pulled the silk tighter than before in order to leave a margin for\nfastening, I selected what I thought was the other end, in order to\nsecure a margin for myself too. Before undoing the sewing I made careful\ndiagrR.ms of the way in which the stitches went, and of the relative poait~ons\nin each stitch of the two colours. The fastening knot was not quite easy\nto undo, but otherwise the unpicking atl'orded no difficulties. The difficul-\nties in sewing it up arose from the impossibility of using a needle in the\nordinary way owing to the shortneaa of the silk. Taking Madanie Coulomb's\nhint, however, I found no great difficulty, though the I,roceas was tedious,\nin pulling the silk through its old holes by means of a loop of hair. By\npulling the stitches tight I secured length enough for fastening at the end,\nand the lIuperO.uous fragments I then cut ott Before replacing the sewing\nI wrote initials inside to pro\\\"e that I had undone it.\nELBANOR MnDBBD SIDGWICK.\nI returned the letter afterwards to Profeaaor Smith, with statements by\nMra. Sidgwick and myself, and have received a reply from Mra. Smith on\nbehalf of her husband (who was too ill to be able to write himself), from\nwhich it appears that Professor and MI,.. Smith were quite satisfied, in con-\nsequence (If the operation performed by ?tlra. Sidgwick, tll&t the supposed\nevidence (.f \"occult\" agency was worthless.\nAPPENDIX XV. (VUk p. 293.)\nCONCERNING H.A.NDWRI!l'ING, d:c.\nEzamination by Mas. SIDGWICK.\nMr. Hodgson was anxious that his statements and conclusions, as regards\nthe handwriting of the Koot Hoomi documents and some other points,\nshould, as far as poasible, be verified in detail by lOme other perlOn, and I\nhave accordingly ezamined all the MSS. in question, which he has had in\nDigitized by Google\n\fOn PM,WI1Jenil cOIlIJected fcith Tkc08opl'!I. 379\nhis handa in England, with great care, with the result that I find myaelf in\ncomplete agreementwith him. His obeervations on documents which he saw\nonly in India I cannot, of course, verify.\nFirat, as regards the plates. The specimens of isolated lettera are, I\nthink,lO far as I have compared them with the originals (or in the case of\nthoae taken from Mr. Sinnett'a aeriea with tracings which I had previously\ncompared with the originala), aa nearly facaimilea as can be expected, with\nthe exception of a certain tremulousneas which they ought not to have, but\nwhich doea not affect them for our preaent purpose. I have thua compared\nthe larger number of the specimens, and where I have not compared the\ncopy with the particular letter from which it waa traced, I can teatify to ita\nstrong resemblance to many other specimens that might have been aelected.\nThe platea reIJreaenting abort paaaagea from diJrerent documenta give a good\ngeneral idea of the writing, but in lOme instancea fail in giving the\nindividual character of particular lettera. Still they are quite aufficiently\naccurate to help the reader to uJideratand the discuaaion. ThOBe copied\nfrom writing in blue pencil are, aa might be expected, leas cloae facaimiles\nthan the othera.\nI have carefully verified every atatement Mr. Hodgaon makea about the\nacknowledged handwriting of Madame Blavatsky, and about the K.H. MSS.\nin England which he attributea to her. I entirely agree with all he saya,\nand am myaelf atrongly convinced that the same pel'8On wrote both. The\ndevelopment of tho K.H. writing is very marked, and the gradual elimina-\ntion of Blavatskian forma is, to say the least of it, auggeative. The argument\nis greatly atrengthened by t.he occaaionalapaamodic appearance of Blavatakian\nforma-aeeminglyby accident-throughout the K.H. )(88. attributed to her\n-and that this is an accident, and an accident which the writer deaired to\navoid, is proved, I think, by the erasures and alterations. The last k\nselected from K.H. No.3 on Plate Ill., which oceura in the original in the\nword Greek, is a fair instance of theae alterations.\nBut convincing aa the two considerations already mentioned are, I think\nthe prevalence of certain peculiaritiea throughout both aeta of documents ia\nmore convincing atill, and in particular the very peculiar a and 9 constantly\noccurring in both. It 80 happened that when Mr. Gribble's pamphlet, men-\ntioned by Mr. Hodgaon, firat reached me, while Mr. Hodgson waa atill in\nIndia, I had in my handa Bome lettera of Madame Blavataky'a and a long\nK.H. document, and naturally turned to Madame Blavataky's handwriting\nto see if it poaaeaaed the characteristica mentioned by Mr. Gribble. There,\nwithout doubt, I found among othera this peculiar a, but it was with a ahock\nof aurprise that I found this same a, which I had never seen in any other\nhandwriting, occurring even more conspicuously in the K.H. document than\nin Madame Blavataky'a acknowledged writing. I have aeen a aomewhat\n. similar formation of a in the handwriting of a Rusaian gentleman.\nI think evidence that the K. H. handwriting is a disguised one may be\nfound in other variations of form besidea thOle which show development.\nThe variations I apeak of remain more or leas constant through a particular\ndocument, but do not appear in other documenta, and thus appear to me to\nsuggeat that the writer waa not using all the forma of lettera instinctively,\nand had not a perfectly clear and 118raiatent idea of what all the forma abould\n2 B 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f380 A.ppendicc.9 to Mr. Hodg80n'8 Report.\nbe. No doubt some variations might be found in every handwriting from\ndocument to document, due to a di1ference of IIpeed in the writing, to the\nkind of pen employed, &C. But those in the K. H. writing seem to me\nmore marked than this, and are the more noticeable all the writing is regular\nand very seldom gives one the impression of being carelessly done.\nI have counted the English and German d', in various writings of\nMadame Blaval:.eky. It is a matter of collsiderable difficulty to count\ncorrectly the number of timell a letter occurs in a long IlL'!. if it is at all\nfrequent j I am, therefore, not surprised to find that my numbers are slightly\ndifferent from Mr. Hodgsoll's. As, however, we in no ca8\/J diffel' by 10 m1u:li.\nas 5 per cent. it is evident that the difference is of no importance whatever\nto the argument, and I therefore considered that it would be Wallte of time\nto repeat the counting. The extreme rarity of the English d in all the\nacknowledged handwriting of Madame Blavatsky in our hands which baa\nbeen written since the K. H. correspondence began, except in the B. Replie.<J,\ncombined with its comparative abundance in the earlier lotters and in the\nB. Replie.<J, is very Btriking, and it is difficult to attribute it to accident.\nI have verified completely every statement about the letter called\nK. H. (Z) and about Mr. Damodar's ordinary writing, and have little doubt\nthat the K. H. (Z) Wall written by him.\nI have also examined the long document professedly in the handwriting\nof Mr.Bhavani Shankar. It appears to me to bear very evident indications of\nbeing written in a disguised hand, and to have enough of the marked\ncharacteristics of Mr. Damodar's handwriting to point to him all the writer.\nI have compared the letter which Mr. Hodgson has called the \"Koot Hoomi\nLal Sing\" with the quotations from it in Mr. Sinnott's\" Occult World,\"\nand find all Mr. Hodgson does, more than 60 di1ferences, without counting\nmis-spellings, changes in punctuation, &C.\nIt only remains to speak of the mis'lIpellings, faults of idiom, &c., quoted\nby Mr. Hodgson from the K.H. documents, and from Madame Blavatsky'a\nown letters. I have compared all these with the originals and believe them\nto be correctly transcribed.

HODGSON'S REPORT.\nBy MRS. H. SIDGWICK.\nThere are certain narratives of phenomena connected with the\nTheosophical Society which haye been brought to the notice of the\nCommittee,whichhave not comewithin the scope ofMr. Hodgson's investi-\ngations. The Committee think, however, that in forming a judgment of\nthe whole p,vidence the reader should have before hint as full an account\nas possible of all such phenomena as there seems to be a prima facie\ndifficulty in explaining by the recognised laws of nature, and they\nhal\"e, therefore, asked me to put together in the present note the residuum\nDigitized by Google\n\fDealt with i\/~ MI'. Hodg$M'S Report. .383\nof narratives with which Mr. Hodgson has not dealt, and to append such\nremarks as seem to me to throw light on them.\nI may observe that .0.11 to which there will be occasion for me to refer\nwere printed in our first report; the only partial exception being an\nincident described by Mr. Rudolph Gebhard (see p. 385), of which we\nhad received no written account when the first report was printed, and\nwhich we, therefore, there very briefly mentioned. No later phenomena\nhave come under our notice.\nThe phenomena I shall have to discuss consist of four cases of\nletters received in a mysterious manner, and four cases of supposed\n\" astral\" apparitions. The mysterious element can be easily eliminated\nin one of the letter-phenomena,and in the case of an apparition of which\nMadame Blavatsky was the alleged percipient. As regards the other\ncases of letters, it is difficult, I think, with our present knowledge, to\nsuggest a completely satisfactory explanation; but with the evidence\nbefore us of an elaborate combination, under Madame Blavatsky's\ndirection, to produce spurious marvels, I cannot attach much weight to\nthis difficulty. The remaining cases of apparitions are undoubtedly\ninteresting, but for reasons which I shall give later on, I do not think\nthat stress can be laid upon thc:a as evidence for the occult powers of\n\" Mahatma lI.\" and Mr. Damodar.\nThe followinll account is from Dr. HUbbe Schleiden, who is a well-\nknown German savant and publicist, author of\" Ethiopien,\" and other\nworks. Madame BlavatSky was in England at the time of the incident.\nElberfeld, Auguat, 1884.\nDear Madam,-You requested me to state to you the particular circum-\nstances under which I received my fi1'8t communication fronl Mahatma K.H.\nI have much pleasure in doing so.\nOn the moming of the 1st of this month Colonel Olcott and 1 were travel-\nling by an expreaa train from here to Dreaden. A few days before I had\nwritten a letter to the Mahatmas which Colonel Olcott had addreaaed and en-\nclosed to you, which, however, as I now hear, never reached you butwas taken\nby the Maate1'8 whilst it was in the hands of the post officials. At the time\nmentioned I was not thinking of this letter, but was relating to Colonel\nOlcott some eventa of my life, expreaaing also the fact that since my sixth or\nseventh year I had never known peace or joy, and asking Colonel Olcott's\nopinion on the meaning of some striking hardships I have gone Utrough. In\nthis converaation we were interrupted by the railway-guard demanding our\nticketa. When I moved forwards and raised myself partly from the seatin order\nto hand over the ticketa, Colonel Olcott noticed something white lying behind\nmy back on that side of me which was opposite to the one where he was sitting.\nWhen I took up that which had appeared there it turned out to be a Tibetan\nenvelope, in which I found a letter from Mahatma K. H., written with blue\npencil in his well-known and unmistakable handwriting. As there were\nseveral other persona unacquainted to us in the comlllU'tment, I SUPI)ose the\nDigitized by Google\n\f384. Note 011 Certain PlImDmelia flot\nMaster chose this place for depositing the letter near me where it wu the\nleast likely to attract the unwelcome attention and curiosity of outsiders.\nThe envelope was plainly addressed to me, and the communication contained\nin the letter was a consoling reflection on the opinion which I had five or ten\nminutes ago given on the dreary events of my past life. The Mahatma ex-\nplained that such events and the mental misery attached to it were beyond\nthe ordinary run of life, but that hardships of all kinds would be the lot of\none striving for higher spiritual development. He very kindly expressed\nhis opinion that I had already achieved some philanthropic work for the\ngood of the world. In this letter were also answered some of the questions\nwhich I had put in my firat-mentioned letter, and an assurance was given\nme that I was to receive aseistance and advice when I should be in need of it.\nI dare say it would be wmecessary for me to ask fou to inform the\nMahatma of the devoted thankfulness which I feel towards him for the great\nkindness shown to me, for the Master will know of my sentiments without\nmy forming them into more or less inadequate words.-I am, dear madam,\nin due respect, yours faithfully,\nHOBBE SCHLBIDEN.\nTo Madame Blavatsky, Elberfeld, Platzhoftitrasse, 12.\nElberfeld, 9\/11\/84.\nDear Sir,-In reply to your question about the letter from Mahatma.\nK. H., which I received in a railway carriage of an express train while in\nmotion, I beg to say that it appears to me absolutely impossible that the\nletter could have been brought into the train by any supposed agent of\nMadame Blavatsky's. It is true we had not changed carriages since leaving\nElberfeld, but the letter did not at all fall out of the air, but wu found\nbehind my back when I moved, and must, therefore, have been deposited\nbetween my back and the cushion of the seat against which I was lying.\nThere was no possibility of getting there for any matter in one of the three or\nfour aggregate states known to our Western science. Besides, Madame\nBlavatsky could have nothing to do with this letter, which was a reply to\nquestions which I had written on Tuesday, the 29th July, and which left\nElberfeld on that or the following day for London, addreB:led to Madame\nBlavatsky. Now, these questions could not have been delivered in London be-\nfore Thursday or Friday of that week, and a reply could, in the ordinary postal\nway, not have been in Elberfeld before Saturday or Sunday. The event of\nmy receiving the reply of the Mahatma, however, occurred on Friday morning,\nthe 1st August. I may mention here that Madame Blavatsky assured me\nshe never found my questions enclosed in the letter to her; these must have\nbeen taken out while in the hands of the post. My best proof of the\ngenuineness of this phenomenon, I find, though, is the contents of the letter,\nfor it was not only a reply to the said questions, but also referred to tile\nconversation I was just at that time having with Colonel Olcott. I cannot\ndoubt that this handwriting of the Mahatma must, therefore, have been\nprecipitated by him at that very instant and transmitted to me by a magic\nprocess which lies beyond the power of ordinary mell.-I am, dear sir, yours\nvery truly,\nHUBBE SCHLBIDEN.\nTo F. W. H. Myers, Esq., Cambridge.\nDigitized by Google\n\fDealt '\/cUn iI' Mr. HodU80I\"8 Repo-rf. 385\nA fewmonths earlier a letteris said to have fallen in a railwaycarriage\noccupied only by Colonel Olcott and Mr. Mohini, in the express train\nbetween Paris and London. But Madame Blavatsky and Babula were\nthen in Paris or its neighbourhood, and though Colonel Olcott and Mr.\nMohini both n'laintain that the letter could not have been placed in the\ncompartment before they started, in such a manner as to fall in the\ncourse of their journey, they have both shown themselves to be too\ninobservant and inaccurate as witnesses for their conviction on this\npoint to be of much value. But in Dr. Hiibbe Schleiden's case I do\nnot feel able to\u00b7 make a definite suggestion as to how the letter\nreached him by natural means ; for, as I have said, Madame Blavatsky\nwas in England, ancl we cannot point to any known agent of hers whom\nwe know to have been at Elberfeld at the time. Still, we- cannot say\nthat there were none, or even that one did not accompany Colonel\nOlcott and Dr. Hiibbe Schleiden in the railway carriage. The relevancy\nof the Koot Hoomi letter to (1) Dr. Hiibbe Schleiden's questions in his\nletter to Madame Blavatsky, and (2) to his conversation with Colonel\nOlcott, I am unable to treat as evidentially importsnt, without more\naccurate knowledge as to the contents of the two letters, since I cannot\nregard it as improbable beforehand that the conversation should take\nthe particular turn which rendered the Koot Hoomi letter appropriate.\nI do not profess, however, as I have said, to give a completely\nsatisfactory explanation of the phenomenon. I am merely suggesting\npossibilities and giving reasons why I cannot, under the circumstances,\nattach weight to it as evidence of occult agency. Other simpler-and\neasier explanations may suggest themselves to the reader's mind. It\nmust be borne in mind that the training for adeptship under Madame\nBlavatsky's supervision is not unlikely to include orders which must be\nblindly carried out, to convey letters mysteriously to other people.\nI give next Mr. Rudolf Gebhard's account of his experience, written\nout by him for Mr. Hodgson. This phenomenon also must, I think,\nremain without special explanation. It is unfortunate that Mr. Gebhard\ndid not write an account of it at the time it occurred, as it is of course\npossible that, after an interval of three months, some importsnt detail\nmay have escaped his memory.\nAdyar, December 31st, 1884.\nDEAR Sm,-Complying with your request I shall giveyou in the following\nan account of a phenomenon as witnessed by me in my father's house lOme\ncouple of months ago.\nBefore I describe what baa happened, allow me to say a few worda about\nmyself ; it will serve to show that I am better adapted than moat \"therpeople\nto advance an opinion on these subjects.\nSince my earliest boyhood I have always had a taste and a knack for\nconjuring tricks. When in London I took lllllOns there from a profeasional\nconjurer, Prof. C. E. Field, a man whom I consider to be one of the best\nDigitized by Google\n\f386 Note M Oertain Pltellotnf'lta not\nsleight-of-hand men 1 ever met. Later on 1 made the personal acquaintance\nof most o.f our leading performers in that line and exchanged tricks\nwith them; there is not a single line of conjuring 1 am not acquainted\nwith, may that be coin or card tricks, or the so-called anti -spiritualistic\ntricks in imitation of a spiritualistic seance. 1 then think that when such\na phenomenon takes place in my presence, it is quite a natural thing for\nme to keep my eyes wide open, in order not to be deceived by a trick, amI\nthis is the reason why 1 think myself especially qualified to advance an\nopinion about the matter on hand.\nAccotmt of a Phenomellon that occurred in Elberfeld (Germany), on\n&ptember -, 1884.\nAt 9 p.m. of the above named date a small circle of friends, Theosophist\nand non-Theosophist, were sitting in the drawing-room of my father's house\n(Platzhoffstrasse 12). Madame Blavatsky, who was one of the party, wsa\nseated on a couch in the middle of the room, and the rest were seated in\na semi-circle around her.\nWhilst the conversation was going on Madame Blavatsky suddenly\nlooked up, and taking a listening attitude said there was something going\non in the room. but that she could not then make out for certain whatit was.\nMrs. H., an American lady and a clairvoyante, said that she had\nfelt an influence since some time already, and Madame Blavatsky and Mrs.\nH. then saw like a ray of light going towards a large oil painting hanging\nover a piano in the same room.\nMy mother, sitting with her back to the piano and opposite a looking-\nglass, said that she had seen in the glass like a faint flash of lightning. After\na minute or so Madame Blavatsky asked the party what they would like\nto take place, as she now felt sure that the \"Master\" would do something\nfor us that night.\nDifferent requests were made, but finally it wsa unanimously resolved\n\"that CJ letter alwuld b. aakeil fOI', addre..ed to my father, atid treating\non II subject that he a1wuld mentaUy u;iah for.\" (I draw your attention to\nthe three points; nobody knew beforehand that the whole party would\nchoose a letter ; second, that my father should be the addre88ee ; third, what\nsubject my father might be thinking of. Madame Blavatsky did not\ninfluence our choice as she did not advance any suggestion.) Madame\nthen said she saw something going on with the picture above spoken of\nand that probably we should find something there. 1 accordingly got up\nand examined that picbure, but could not find anything. As the picture\nwas fastened to the wall in a slanting position, the top part hanging over,\n1 lifted it oft' the wall and examined carefully every inch of it. No\nletter! The space then between the wall and the back of the picture Willi\nfully eight inches and perfectly lit up, sa there was a gas bracket on each\nside of it. 1 let the picture fall back and said 1 could not find anything,\nbut Madame Blavatsky told nie to try again, and 1 repeated my examination\nin the same way. Not contented with that 1 got up on the piano (a.\ngrand,) and there again looked behind the picture and passed my hand\nalong the top of it, twice. Nothing! (I had been searching all this time\nfor a letter, not for another article where perhaps a slip of paper had\nDigitized by Google\n\fDealt trith ill Mr. Hodgson's lleport. 381\nescaped my attention.) I turned round to Madame Blavatsky, saying that\nI could find nothing, when she exclaimed, \"There it is!\" I turned\nsharply round and a lettw fell down from behind the picture on the piano.\nI picked it up. It was addressed to my father, (\" Herm Consul Gebhard \")\nand treated of the subject he had been thi'lking of.\nNow I wish to draw your attention to BOme important points.\n1. There was-no secret receptacle either in the frame or at the back of\nthe picture. 2. The letter was in size 5in. by 2iin. twt folded up into a\nsmaller compaBII. 3. I was the only one who came near the picture ; all the\nothers kept their seats except one gentleman, who got up, but whom I did\nnot allow to handle the picture. Madame Blavatsky, seated all the time on\nthe couch, distant four to five yards. 4. Between the time I last touched\nthe picture and the moment the letter put in an appearance there elapsed\nfrom 15 to 20 seconds. After Madame Blavatsky had said \"There it is,\" I\nturned round. The letter then had not appeared but came in view\nabout one second after that. How could Madame Blavatsky have seen\nit 1 5. The letter lay on the piano about fioe inehu off the waU! The\npicture frame at the bottom part touches the wall, because as I said\nbefore the top part hangs over. Now there may be space enough for a letter,\nbeing flat against the wall, to glide through, but then that letter, continuing\nits way, ought to drop behind the piano (i.e., between the wall and the\npiano and from there on to the floor), as the piano does not touch the wall.\nHow can it be found five inches oft'the wall 7 6. The subject my father had\nin his mind was known to me, because I knew he had that very morning\nreceived a letter from my brother in New York on BOme personal matter, and\nwhen the letter had been decided upon by the party I whispered to my\nfather, \"Ask for an answer on that letter, this morning,\" and he said he would.\nI consider this a most complete phenomenon, and I challenge any\nconjurer of to-day to repeat it, and I am willing to pay \u00a3100 to see it done\nby a conjurer under the Banle conditions. Perhaps Mr. Maskelyne (Messrs.\nMaskelyne and Cooke, Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly), who has done already so\nmuch to detect mediuntistic frauds (1), will take up this challenge.\nIf there is any further information you want, I anI entirely at your\nservice.-I remain, dear sir, your obedient servant,\nR. Hodgson, Esq., Adyar. RUD. GEBHARD.\nI learn from Mr. Hodgson that, in reply to his inquiries, Mr. Gebhard\nstated that he did not think that a confederate could have throWIl the\nletter without ita being observed, but he did not seem to have\npreviously contemplated the possibility of a confederate haling been\npresent.\nThe following is an account of another letter-phenomenon by a lady\nresident in London, and knoWIl to some members of the Committee :-\nOne morning in July, [1884,]1 was called by Madame Blavatsky to her room\nwhere she was still in bed. She desired me to open a drawer and give her\nout a letter which was lying there closed and addre88ed. I did BO. She\nasked me to notice that the letter was addre88ed in the handwriting of a\nperson whom I knew, that it was fastened, and apparently had not been\nDigitized by Google\n\u2022\n\f\u2022\n388 Note on Certain PMnomena flOt\nopened. She then took a match and having lighted it proceeded to burn the\nletter. I protested against this being done, but she answered .. It is the\nMaster's orden,\" and further added, \"You had better go to your room and\nmeditate.\" I went upstail'8 into my room and shut the door. I remained\nthere some time considering the whole aft'air. The window of the\nroom, which was at the top of the house, was wide open and looked out\ninto a garden. Before the window was a dre&8ing-table.oll which was a pink\ncloth ; there was no mirror on the table, only one or two small articles of\ntoilet, and the sun was shining full into the room. I went to the window\nwithout any definite reason,and as I approached the table I perceived on the\npink cover a large white envelope. I took it up, looked at it, and found that\nit was closed and evidentlycontained a letter, but there was no supel'llCription.\nI had the letter in my hand for a little while and then looked atit again. To\nmy JV9&t surprise I found that where, but a few moments previously, there\nhad been a blank space, there was distinctly visible a name and addre&8 written\nin purple ink, in a handwriting which I well knew as being that of one\nof the Mahatmas. The Dame and addre&8 was that of the writer of the letter\nI had previously Been burned.\nA phenomenon of tIlls kind may be, and in this case was, as I under-\nstand, very impressive to the witness, without carrying conviction to\nother people. For it is impossible for them to feel sure that it was\nadequately distinguished from what, I suppose, we are all constantly\nliable to, the mere non-observation of something which was there all the\ntime. It is possible also that some combination of substances may have\nbeen used instead of ink, which would become coloured (temporarily at\nany rate) by exposure for a few minutes to the air. A chemist, well\nqualified to give an opinion, tells me that he thinks such a combination\nmight be used; but we have never seen and have no access to the\nwriting in question, and without this it is of course impossible to obtain\nan expert's opinion of any value as to whether this particular writing\ncould have been so produced or not. I do not myself think it likely\nthat it was so produced.\nAs to a post-card received by Mr. Keightley in Paris, on which\nMahatma M.'sinitials were written, and a letterwhich Madame Blavatsky\nprofessed to read without opening, also in Paris, it is unnecessary to say\nmore than that Babula seems to have intervened between the postman\nand the recipient in both cases. The letters probably came by an earlier\ndelivery than that by which they appeared to arrive.\nI proceed to \"astral\" apparitions. In August, 1884, Mr. Myers\nreceived the following letter from Mr. PAdshAh, a young Parsee gentle-\nman and a Theosophist.\n77, Elgin Crescent, Notting Hill, W.\nSaturday, August 16th.\nDear Mr. MY(ll'l,-Madame has just told me that she saw Damodar last\nnight, quite distinctly, standing in a corner facing the chair in which she was\nDigitized by Google\n\fDealt with in Mr. Hodgson's Report. 389\nseated in the drawing-room. There were present.in the room, Mr. and Mrs.\nOakley, Mr. Gebhard, and othe1'8, who do not seem to have known or felt\nhis presence. Madame tells me that he had come to ask what it was she had\ntold him about some trunk the night before. It appearB she had told him\nthe previous night to take care in the Custom House of a certain trunk taken\nby Babula, who has proceeded to India to-day. Darnodar, unable, however,\nto make himself more distinct. as Madame desired, seems to have not under-\nstood her. So he appeared again this morning nlore than once, asking,\n\" Why do you not answer about the trunk \u00a5\" Madame tells me she related\nthe appearance the night before to Mrs. Z.,'\" Mrs. X.,... and Miss Z.... The\ncircumstance would have been thought of no more, but on my consulting\nMadame this afternoon about some articles about to appear in The TheOlOphiBt\nshe naturally spoke ofDamodar ;and among otherthings, very enthusiastically\nof his latest development. It occurred to me that this was a splendid chance\nfor the Society for Psychical Research ; you had repeatedly desired me to\ncommit to paper what I have seen or might see, and there are many friencIa\nin England and India who are ready to trust my word. I suggested I should\nwrite to you, and wait for Damodar's letter, where he might refer to his astral\npresence. But that would be no test. I suggested an immediate despatch\nof a telegram, and also a letter to you aigned by Mr. Keightley and Mr.\nGebhard, who had come some time before, and myself. Mr. Keightley made\nsome difficulties as to the value of the test, alleging that our word may not\nsuffice for the Society for Psychical Research. I prefer to think otherwise.\nAnd, accordingly, the telegram is decided upon. It is in these terms;-\nTo Damodar, Theoeophiat Office, Madras.\nTelegraph instantly what you told me last night. BLA.VA.T8KY.\nYou will see that I have suggested the telegram should be from Madame\nBlavatsky, to undo any difficulty Damodar might make to reply to otherB-\nfor instance, to the Society for Psychical Researt'h.\nMadanle is going to-day to Elberfeld, and I shall open the answer as soon\nas Damodar telegraphs it, and send you a copy.\nI hope Damodar will make no difficulties now, and the test will be, we\ntrust. if not complete, at least of considerable scientific value.-I remain,\ndear Mr. Mye1'8, youn sincerely, B. J. PA.D8BA.H.\nThe telegram received from Mr. Damodar in reply seemed distinctly\nirrelevant. It ran; \"Master wanta you here to-night don't fail look into\nyour pocket.\"\nOn August 30th Mr. Myers proceeded to Elberfeld and inquired of\nlIr. Keightley (a Theosophist and a graduate of Trinity College, Cam-\nbridge, who was staying at Mr.Gebhard's along with Madame Blavatsky,\n:Mr. Mohini, Colonel Olcott, doc.), whether he had received Mr. Damodar's\ntelegram and what he thought of it. He replied that the party had\nleft London on August 16th, and arrived at Elberfeld on the 17th. On\narriving they were met by a telegram from Mr. PAdshah, reporting Mr.\n\u2022 J.'ictitiou8 initials.\nDigitized by Google\n\f390 Note 01. Certain Phmomena not\nDamodar's reply. The whole party, said Mr. Keightley, were surprised\nand distressed at what seemed to them also the conspicuous failure of\nthe intended test. Madame Blavatsky said that she had in fact received\nsuch a message, and had found such a letter in her pocket; but, of\ncourse, recognised the inadequacy of such statement. It then occurred\nto her to consult her private note-book. This was said to be contained\nin a despatch-box which had been in Mr. Keightley's charge from the\ntime when it was packed and locked, just after the telegram had been\nsent to Damodar, and just before the party left London by an evening\ntrain, August 16th, for Elberfeld, viii Queenborough and Flushing. She\na.t once asked Mr. Keightley to go and fetch the despatch-box. In the\nnote-book was found the entry here translated, which was then seen by\nall present. It is written partly in Russia.n, partly in English. The\nwords in italics are in English in the original.\n\" I saw suddenly Damodar this August 15th. While looking on I called,\ntrying to find out some one near me to call attention to hinl. I was sitting\nunder the looking-glass, and tried to make myself heard by Mrs. Z., who was\nsitting near Mrs. Oakley. Upon seeing him, I said to him: DamodGt', can't\n!IOU make '!JO'Urle'j eiBible to aU ? Instead of answering, he says to me some-\nthing very strange, that he had 88en me the night before, and could not\nunderstand what I wanted from him. He 88id: You came to me about t11:'0.\nI could not utuUl'stand 1Vhat !IOU were aaking me for. I. it for a tMlnk ,ent\nher.? Then 1\\ few minutes later he again appeared and said: Maater 1eanu\nyou here to-night. Don't fail. Look into !lour pocket.\"\nOnWednesday,September10th,aletterfromMr. Damodarwasreceived\nat Elberfeld by Madame Blavatsky in the presence of Mr. Keightley,\nwho noted its registered envelope; * and believes that the letter had gone\nfirst to London and been forwarded to Elberfeld.\nThe letter-which all who have examined it believe to be in Mr.\nDamodar's handwriting-is as follows:-\nAdyar, Madras, 16th August, 1884.\nRespected Upaaika,-I could not make out what you wanted here when\nyou canle here on the morning of the 15th at about two or three of Madras\ntime. So in the night I attempted to come and ask you. It was between 10and\n11 in the night here; so it must be between five and six in the evening of\nLondon time. Who was that gentleman sitting near you under a big looking-\nglass and who was that sllort old lady about 1 I think there were several\nothers in the room at the time; but I could not make out how Dlany or who\n\u2022 Mr Keightley noticell that the envelope was registered, with Dalllodar, he\nbelieves, written in the corner, and that the letter was actually in the em'eiolle\n-the letter being in Damodar'lj hanllwriting. But Mr. KeightIey and Madame\nBlavatsky between them then lost the envelolle. 'Ve ha,'e, however, ascer\u00b7\ntained that a registered letter answering to the description of this one reachell\nLondon on September 7th.

Whether I succeeded\nor failed, I do not know. And in all this affair, the main object I came for was\nnot quite accomplished. I wanted to know exactly what you had come here\nfor 1 I heard something about a trunk; but whether you wanted me to take\ncare of something you had sent or whether you wanted me to send you\nsomething I do not quite remember.

I am sure Mr. Ewen\nand others would have done it, if I had not asked you privately to prevent\nthe publication of the fact of Mr. Ewen having seen me when I came to see\nyou and Colonel Olcott and committed a blunder. I hope I have not com-\nmitted a mistake in sending you the parcel.\nEver yours respectfully and sincerely,\nDAlIODAR K. MAVALANKAR.\nIt certainly cannot be said that the possibility of collusion between\nlIadame Blavatskyand Mr. Damodar is in this case excluded. But\nthough on the one hand it may seem strange that a planned imposture\nshould not have been better carried out, it must be observed on the\nother hand that there are points in the evidence which look decidedly\nSUSpICIOUS. Of course, if there was imposture--as, considering what we\nnow know about both Madame Blavatsky and Mr. Damodar, I cannot\nmyself profess to doubt-we cannot be sure of discovering the precise\nmodu8 operandi by merely reflecting on the phenomena intended to\nappear. But the following may be suggested as a possible course of\nevents.\nLet us suppose that some time in July, after she had begun her\nresidence at Elgin-crescent, and could therefore describe the looking-\nglass and the lady, Madame Blavatsky wrote to Mr. Damodar telling\nhim to post a letter on August 16th, such as that we have printed, and\nthat she would take care to make it correspond with events in London;\nand further, that when the day came she performed more or less\nimperfectly-or perhaps only spoke of-her part of the programme,\nbut forgot the \"Master-wants-you-here-to-night-look-in-your-pocket \"\npart. Let us further assume that the telegram to India was no\npart of the original plan, and that Mr. DamOdar was left to his own\ndeyices in replying to it. It would not be unnatural that he should\nreply as he did, that being, in fact, the only thing he was supposed to\nhave lold her; about the trunk he was supposed to have asked her. I\ncannot regard it as at all satisfactorily established that M8.C'lllme\nDigitized by Google\n\f31}2 Note on Oertain Phenomena 110t\nBIa.vatsky had no opportunity of obtaining access to her note-book\nbetween the time when the telegram wa.s sent to Mr. Damodar and the\ntime when the book wa.s shown to the party at Elberfeld; and I think\nthe entry may have been made, or, at any rate, the last sentence added,\nin that interval ;-either after Mr. Damodar's telegram wa.s received, or\nat some previous moment, when it recurred to her memory that he was\nto be supposed to have made that remark about the Ma.ster. Thus all\nthat occurred would be accounted for.\nIt is possible that the entry in Ma.da.me BIa.vatsky's note-book may\nhave been made much earlier-at the time when she first communicated\nthe pIa.n to Mr. Damodar-and corrected afterwards; for the names of\nthe persons present-Mrs. Z. and Mr. and Mrs. Oakley-are written in\nlead pencil over the original purple pencil, rendering what is underneath\nillegible. But I 80m not myself inclined to believe that the greater part\nof it\u00b7 wa.s written at this earlier date, because if it had been, I think that\nMadame Blavatsky's and Mr. Damodar's descriptions of the scene\nwould have agreed better than they do. Madame Blavatsky's phrases,\nCI I called, trying to find out some one near me\". \u2022 . CI tried to\nmake myself heard by Mrs. Z.,\" &c., do not correspond well with Mr.\nDamodar's question about the gentleman \"sitting near\" her.\nThere is another point which strikes me a.s somewhat suspicious\nabout Madame BIa.vatsky's entry in her'note-book, and which strengthens\nmy impression that it was made after the telegram was sent. For\nwhat purpose wa.s it made 1 Why, if it was merely as a record of an\nevent interesting to herself, and not for comparison with an expected\nletter from Mr Damodar, should she put in so uninteresting a fact as\nthat she was sitting under the looking-glass 7 But if it was intended for\nthis Ia.tter object, it would have been natural to show it to some one at\nthe time the sending of the telegram was being discussed, had it been\nthen in existence, and thus to improve the test. I think it probable,\ntherefore, that the entry was made after, the telegram was sent, though\nvery likely before the answer was received.\nThe allusion at the end of Mr. Damodar's letter is to an apparition\nof him seen by Mr. E. D. Ewen, of Che.ttisgarh, Central Provinces of\nIndia.. Mr. Ewen, who is a Scotch gentleman of honourable repute,\nwhose organisation is highly nervous, saw Mr. Damodar (with whom\nhe was acquainted) in \"astral\" form, a.s he supposed, on May 23rd,\n1884, in London. On his mentioning this at a meeting of our\nSociety, on May 28th, Mr. Damodar was at once telegraphed to by\nColonel Olcott (Mr. Myers being present) in the following words:\n\u2022 It is noticeable that the first sentence is written in blue pencil, and the rest\nin purple, with the exception of the correctionsin lead pencil. This8Uggeats that\nthe whole note was not written at the same time.\nDigitized by Google\n\fDealt with in Mr. Hodgson's Rl'1JOl't. 393\n.. Olcott to Damodar, Adyar, Madras. Have you visited London lq.telyf\nwrite Myers full details.\" To this telegram no reply was received, from\nwhich it is a natural inference that Mr. Damodar was unaware of the\nvision, though he may have had other reasons for his silence. His\nmentioning it in his letter of August 16th proves nothing, of course,\nsince there had then been more than time to acquaint him by post with\nthe facts. We are thus left without any evidence to distinguish Mr.\nEwen's experience from a merely subjective hallucination.\nTwo other visions I have to deal with. The first is an experience\nthat occurred to Mr. Vsevolod Solovioff, Page of Honour to the Czar,\nIlnd son of the tutor of the late Czar, and a Russian author of high\nrepute. He describes what occurred as follows :-\n.. 1 Octobre, 1884, Paris.\n\"Ayant reQu une lettre de ma compatriote, Mme.

SolovioW tells us tha.t he\ntried to persuade himself throughout the following day, till he received\nthe note, that it was a hallucination, but it was very unlike the\nhallucinations that are known to occur to sane and healthy persons.\nI do not myself think that there is the same difficulty in supposing it\nto have been an unusually vivid dream. It will be observed that no\nsatisfactory test of an objective origin is aWorded by the occurrences of\nthe next day. Madame Blavatsky's remark that the Master and one of\nhis pupils had been with him, was a perfectly safe one. \" The Master\"\nwould do either for Koot Hoomi or :M., and the Chela would cover a.\nconsiderable range of other possibilities; while, if Madame Blavatsky had\nbeen wrong in assuming that the question\" Vous n'avez rien ame dire7 \"\nindicated that there had been an experience of some sort, the non-seeing\nof the Master could be accounted for by a want of sufficient development\non the part of M. SolovioW; or in whatever way the non-seeing of the\nChela actually was accounted for. The contents of the note found in\nColonel Olcott's pocket added no confirmation, amI the note might\ncn.sily, it would seem, have found its way there by natural means with-\nout his knowledge. We have not the details of MellIe. A.'s experience,\nbut I believe it consisted in a dream or vision, more or less similar to M.\nSolovioft\"s. It is possible that, If we had the details, we might find it\nmore probable than not that the dreams were telepathically connected :\nbut thc similarity of circumstances and conditions, of trains of thought\nand emotions, before retiring to rest, might easily lead to similar\nnocturnal experiences.\nSince writing the above I have learnt that, owing to events which\nhave since occurred, M. Solovioft' no longer regards his experience as\naffording any evi(lence of occult ag~ncy.\nIf M. Solovioft\"s experience was a dream, we have no reason fl)J\nregArding the following experience of :Mrs. Gebhard, with which 1 will\nconclude, as anything but a waking one.\nMI'S: Gebharcl, of Elberfeld, well known to one member of the\nCommittee, writes as follows with regard to an incident which occurred\n2 c 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f396 Note by Mrs. H. Siaglcick.\nat a meeting of the London Lodge of the Theosophical Society, on\nApril 7th, 18~4. On that occasion, Madame Blavatsky, who had come\nin unexpectedly, and was sitting among the audience, suddenly called to\n?tIl'. Mobini, as though slle saw some one. Mr. Mohini joined her in a.\nlobby, and appeared also to perceive some one, whom he saluted with\nrespect. Col~mel Olcott's speech, however, was not interrupted, and\nnothing was said to show who it was that Madame Blavataky and Mr.\nMohini thus greeted. At the end of the meeting, they both stated that\nthey had seen Mahatma M.\n\" On the 7th of April last, being at a meeting of the Theosophical Society\nat Mr. Finch's rooms, Lincoln's Inn, I had a vision, in which I saw the\nl'tl'khatma M. At tho moment I was listeningattentivelytoColonelOlcott's open-\ning speech to the Society. I saw standing on my right side, a little in front, a\nvery tall, majestic-looking pel'BOn, whom I immediately recognised to be the\nMahatma, from a picture I had seen of hun in Mr. Sinnett's poBBeBsiOIl. He\nwas not clad in white, but it seemed to me to be some dark material with\ncoloured stripes, which was wound round his form. The vision lasted only a\nfow seconds. A. far as I could learn, the only pel'BOns besides myself who\nhad soen the Mahatma were Colonel Olcott, Mr. Mohini, and, of course,\nMadame BlavatBky. \"MARY GEBHARD.\"\nThis may have been 0. collective hallucination, and as such woul(l\nhave been very interesting; but we have not the contemporaneous and\nindependent accounts of Mr. Mohini and Colonel Olcott as to dress,\n\u00abc., nor the e~idence as to the time of the appearance, which would be\nrequired to prove this.\nWe have then, as I said at the beginning, three experiences, one of\nthem adapted to corroborate the assertion that Mr. Damodar can\nproject his\" astral form,\" and the other two apparently confirmatory\nof the existence of Mahatma M., and in two out of these three cases the\npercipient was probably completely awake. It must, howe\\'er, be\nremembered that one result of the investigations of the Literary Com-\nmittee is that merely subjective hallucinations occur to sane and healthy\npersons considerably more frequently than is generally supposed; and\nsecondly, that what makes these experiences available as evidence for\nMadame Blavatsky is her previous allegation that Mr. Damodar and\nMahatma M. were liable to appear, while the expectation caused by\nthis allegation may have operated in producing the hallucinations, or\ndetermining their form.\nIn any case, though the experiences are interesting and important in\nrelation to the general im'estigations of the Society-yet in the absence\nof other evidence for the existence of M., or for Mr. Damodar's power of\nvoluntarily appearing; and in the absence also of such evidence in each\ninstance as we should require, if it stood alone, to distinguish it from a\nmerely SUbjective experience-they cannot be held to pro\\'e any of the\npowers claimed for \" Adepts\" and their discipl~\nDigitized by Google\n\fDetaila qf ti,e Ecidelltc l'rfi:rrecl to OIJ Page 207. 397\n5. DETAILS OF THE EVIDENCE REFERRED TO ON PAGE 207.\nIn July, 1879; shortly after he had urgently represented to Madame\nBlaYll.tsky the desire of himself and other members of the Theosophical\nSociety, in London, for independent proof of the existence of\nCI Adepts,\" Mr. C. C. Massey found in the minute book of the Society\na lettel' addressed to him, and purporting to come from one of the\nAdept \"Brothers\"; Madame Blavatsky being then in India. This\ndiscovery was made at the lodgings of a member of the Society (who was\nat that time a non-professiona.l medium), and in whose custody the\nminute book then was. The book was brought to Mr. Massey by this\nmedium in connection with the business of the Society. The medium\nwill be here described as X., and the medium's \"control\" as Z.*\nIn May, 1882, Mr. Massey was shown a letter addressed to X. (who\nhad then ceased to reside in this country), apparently in Madame\nBlavatsky's handwriting, dated 28th June, 1879, and contained in\nan envelope bearing the l.'8gistered London post-mark, 21st July, 1879.\nHe took a copy of the first part of the letter, which was as follows :-\nMy DEAR GOOD FlUEND,-Do you remember what Z. told or rather\npromised to me 1 That whenever there is need for it, he will always be\nready to carry any message, leave it either on Massey's table, his pocket, or\nBOme other mysterious place 1 Well now there is the most important tlU(t\nfor such a show of his powers. Please ask him to take the enclosed letter\nand put it into M.'s pocket or in BOme other still more mysterious place.\nBut he mu.H twt know it's Z. Let him think what he likes, but he must not\nsuspect you had been near him with Z. at your orders. He doesllot distrust\nyou, but he does Z.\nAlso if he could treat L. L. with BOme Oriental token of love it would be\nright, but none of them must suspect Z. of it, therefore it is more difficult\nto make it to do it (6ic) than it would otherwise be were it to be produced at\none of your seances . . . &c.\nMr. Massey was not at that time at liberty to take the otherwise\nob,ious course of communicating on the subject with Madame Blavatsky\nor X. (with neither of whom, moreover, was he then in correspondence),\nand it was not till some months later-autumn of 1882-that, the\ncircumstances of the Society \u00a788ming to him to require the disclosure,\nhe communicated the facts privately to friends in it.\nIt is noteworthy that a letter written by Madame Blavatsky to Mr.\nMassey on July 2nd, 1879, four days after the date of the letter to X.,\nseems mainly written in order to say that the London Fellows of the\nTheosophical Society are not to have phenomena, and to explain why.\nShe says in it: \" I tell you as a fact that the desires of the London\n\u2022 The 8uppI'eIlIIion of these names is by requeHt of l\\lr.

But it has always ended in the unanimous\nconviction that to do this, would only degrade adeptship, and help the\nfalse theories of Spiritualism.\" Knowledge of the letter found in the\nminute book seems therefore to be implicitly denied. Mr. Massey\nendeavoured to obtain some explanation of it from Madame Blavatsky,\nbut without success.\nIt was pot until May, 1884, that on receiving a letter from Madame\nBlavatsky-the first for several years-on another matter, he sent her\na. copy of so much of the letter to X. as he had transcribed, amI\nobtained in reply all acknowledgment that she was the author of all\nthat pll.rt of it which concerned him.

That I saw nothing in it then, aa I do not see now, of 80\ndreadful, is only a proof that I have not received lily education in London\nand that our notions of the honourable and the dishonourable did'er. . \u2022 \u2022\nThere are three points which 111ay be specially noted in this letter.\nFirst, the part of the letter to X. acknowledged by Madame Blavatsky\nclearly indicates a plan of imposing on Mr. Massey as a manifesta\u00b7\ntion of the power of the Mahatmas a. phenomenon which she knew not\nto be due to any such agency. Secondly, the whole letter to X. as\nabove quoted suggests a strong suspicion that she intended the\nphenomenon to be produced by perfectly natural and normal a.gency.\nThis suspicion, however, would be most strongly suggested by the part\nof the letter which does not relate to ?rlr.

H. MYERS.\nTom ,mIlO\" fffW8iIlT'.S 8\"1 ffpotlllClJ\/HTu il\u00abMT'rOf.\n-ExPBoocLBS.\nAfter years of neglect, Mesmerism is once again, though in a tone\nless violent and defiant than heretofore, making a very distinct claim\nto serious attention. It has not, indeed, passed the stage of having its\nexistence widely doubted; but those who grant its existence are more\nand more impressed with a sense of its importance-not as a mere\nisolated group of marvels, but in virtue of its intimate relations with\npsychical research in general; and it is with this view of it that we are\nourselves concerned in the present paper. We have already dealt at\nsome length with the primary thesis of the reality of Mesmerism.* We\nhave considered adverse theories, and endeavoured to show that, beyond\nthe recognised effects of attention and inhibition which are broadly\nclassed under the name of Hypnotism, there is sufficient evidence for a\nspecific influence whereby certain individuals can originate in certain\nothers a well\u00b7marked group of physical and mental phenomena. The\ntopics with which we have further to deal are of wider scope, and\nstranger complexion. They are three in number, and may be briefly\ndesignated as (1) the mesmeric treatment of disease; (2) silent\n\" willing\" and \"willing\" at a distance; (3) clairvoyance.\nThe three classes differ among themselves in their relations both to\nscience and to mesmerism proper. In the first class-that of \"mesmeric\nhealing \"-a very large number of cases fall within (or at any rate not\nmuch beyond) the limits of admitted physiological law; and, so far,\nare not (like BOme of the effects discuased in former papers) crucial tests\nof a specific mesmeric influence. Some of them may be ascribed to the\nrecognised \"action of the mind on the body \"; others may be, at most,\nmerely \"1JP'fIOtic in origin-due, that is, to the profound nervous change\nwhich is now so widely admitted as a true effe..-t of monotonous sensory\nstimulation. It is possible, indeed, that in proportion as the student\nrealises the complexity and profundity of the changes induced, he will\nbe disinclined to assign rigid limits to the possible methods of inducing\nthem-and the more so if, mingled with the easily explicable csses, he\n\u2022 Proceedinf\/', Vol. I., p. 251, &0. ; Vol. II., P. 201, &0. ; and p. 289, &0.\nDigitized by Google\n\f402 Some Higher Aspects of Mesmerism.\nencounters others to which (as before) the theories of imagination and\nof hypnotism seem manifestly inappropriate. Yet even of these latter\ncases, where mesmeric influence has to be accepted, and orthodox\nphysiology is so far left behind, some sort of physiological picture of the\nevents is still conceivable. The same may be said of our 8econd class of\ncases, those of silent or distant \"willing.\" For the rapport here\nimplied may be represented as only a special extension of that\n\" telepathic\" sympathy between two organisms, the doctrine of which\nis slowly creeping within the circle of scientific acceptance, and may\nalmost be said to tremble on the confines of orthodoxy. With our\nthird class-clairvoyance-it is far otherwise; and this class is to hI.'\ndoubly distinguished from the others. On the one hand, it carries us\nat a bound beyond all conceivable limits of physiological explanation;\nwhile on the other hand it is not primAJacie suggestiTe of any mesmeric\ninfluence at all. Mesmerism, if that is indeed the means by which the\nclairvoyant state is induced, is here no more than the gate which intro-\nduces us to an unknown world; and the question of th~ method of\ninduction (hypnotic or mesmeric) sinks, one may say into insignificance,\nin comparison with the extraordinary problems presented hy the\ncondition itself.\nWe are fully aware of the difficulties which such language suggests,\nand of the a.ttitude of contemptuous disregard which it is apt to provoke.\nThat attitude is, indeed, one which, we think, admits here of special\nexcuse. For of all subjects Mesmerism is, perhaps, the one that has\nsuffered most from its own supporters; and he who attempts to form a\njudgment of it from its literature finds himself too often wading through\na morass of unstable theory, played over by the ignisJatuUB ofan ill-\ntrained imagination. Even attempts at more direct study are apt to\nlead the inquirer into dismal realms of credulity, ignorance, and im-\nposture; while the genuine facts, like other rare vital phenomena,\nhavc had no particular tendency to spring up among the persons best\nfitted to weigh or record them. It is comparatively seldom that a.\ncompetent eye has been rea.dy to note them as they arrived; and en-\nthusiasts have been wont to embroil what philosophers have declined to\ndisentangle. Such a statement is itself a lesson of caution; and in\nattempting here a somewhat more accurate treatment, it is ra.ther with\nthe facts than with their explanation that we shall be concerned. So\nfar from solving difficulties, our task will be rather to indicate\nwhere they lie, and to bring out their true Dlagnitude. But as regards\nthe facts themselves, we hope to show that insurmountable as the c\\\npriori objections to them may seem, and embedded as the record of\nthem too often is in futile and flighty speculation, the evidence is still\nsuch as no a priori o~iectiollB can suffice to invalidate. Considering\nhow often primdJacie contradictions in Nature have been a.fterwards\nDigitized by Goo\n\fSQme Higlltr ..A..8peCt8 oj Mesmerism. 403\nharmonised, it is too late in the day for positive testimony Qf the\nquantity and quality which is forthcoming on these matters to suffer a\npermanent eclipse; and it is beyond question that the confidence of\ndenunciation with which that testimony has been swept out of court\nhas been in inverse ratio to the care with which it has been examined.\nAs regards the first of our topics-mesmeric treatment of disease-\nthough it was here that the aim was most popular and the evidence\nmost abundant, there were special reasons why it never effected any\npermanent lodgment in the public mind. The first of these reasons\nlies in a single word-anathetics. At the very moment (1846) when\nmesmerism was being forced upon the profession by the cases of\npainless operations which wore recorded almost weekly, U animal\nmagnetism,\" in the Lancet'8 worda, was U superseded\" by the inhalation\nof ether. U Hurrah! Rejoice!\" wrote Mr. Liston in the North\nBritish Review, U mesmerism and its professors have met with a heavy\nblow, and great discouragement\" ; and although the exultation might\nperhaps have been better bestowed on the boon to sufferers than on the\nblow to rivals, the fact was beyond a doubt. For whereas curative\nmesmerism claims to possess two main powers, the power of rapidly\nant86tMtiaing and the power of gradually 'I1itGli.9ing-aasisting, that is\nto say, by some change in circulation or innervation the curative pro-\ncesses of Nature-it is pla.in that Ule frequent and familiar sight of\nthe fi\u00b7,.at of these powers is almost a necessary pre-requisite for the\npatience needed to await the slow operation of the ~ond. While\nEsdailt!' was constantly performing the most terrific operations without\nevoking a groan, the agency which he used received such an advertise-\nment as induced people to wait long, and try patiently, in order to\nfind out all that that agency could do. But the new anathetics-\nmore rapid and more certain than mesmerism in Europe has ever been\n-took from the mesmeriser's hands the very patients on whom he\nmight have proved his powers at a. stroke. When there ceased to be\nany brilliant and unmistakable achievements to which he could point\n-when no one any longer begged to try his art for the excision of a\ntumour or the removal of a limb-his merely restorative passes, 00\noften continued without obvious results for many a weary hour,\nseemed as devoid of reassuring potency as the Prophet's prescription,\n.. Wash in Jordan and be clean.\"\nNor are further reaBOnshard to find why mesmeric treatment should\nlanguish, when once the uniqueness cf its claim was gone. It was\ntedious to 1he patient, and it was notremunerative to any one else. Not\none, not even Mesmer himself, evermade a fortune by its aid. Nor has\nit those characteristics which sometimes make patients secretly cling to\nremedies that their medical advisers laugh at. The success of paten~\npills, for instance, depends either on capital or on cathartics. If th.\nDigitized by Google\n\f404 . \u00b7Some Higller .A.8pect8 of Me8meri8m.\nvendor can paint their name on every rock, in sight of every railway, in\nthe United States, he may make them of what he pleases. If he cannot\npush them thus, he must teach them to make their own way by produc-\ning BO~ manifest effect, though it may not be precisely the effect which\nhe claims for them. Now, mesmerism would never pay to advertise;\nand in a great majority of cases where it is tried on white men, it pro-\nduces no effect at all.\nSo far, then, the advocates of curative mesmerism might fairly com-\nplain of bad luck; but there were further sources of weakness in their\nown camp.\nWe have spoken of the quantity of evidence which they brought to\nbear; but the reception and the rejection of this evidence have, we\nthink, been equally uncritical. It seems to have been thought\nnecessary either to accept every reported case as conclusive of the\njustice of the mesmerist's claim, or to refuse to attach the slightest im-\nportance to a single one of them. Fairly regarded, the cases seem to\ndemand most careful distinction. The evidence of the mesmeric effects\non Bensibility, not only in the production of anresthesia but in the relief\nof chronic pain, seems prim4\/acie overwhelming; and in the same class\nwe may include the benefit accruing from the production of Bleep in\ncnses (such as chorea. and delirium tremens) where narcotics are\nunadvisable or useless. But it is far otherwise with the evidence for the\nactual curing of disease. It is easy to see beforehand how the testimony\nin these two classes is certain to differ. Pain is a. subjective fact, the\nattestation of which always has come and always must come from the\npatunt, and the value of such lay evidence was as great 40 years ago\nas it is now; nor do the facts of sleep, and the power of observing its\nbeneficial effects, belong more to one generation than another. But the\nvalue that can be attached to the evidence of the e:rpert~ of the past\ndiminishes, as time goes on, with the advance of diagnosis and treat-\nment; and the impression produced now on a. medical expert, as he\nturns over the 13 volumes of the Zoist, might probably be that, of\nthe cases competently observed at the time, the proportion is small\nindeed where the alle~ facts may notbe accounted for, either by a. mis-\ntaken diagnosis, or at any rate by a substitution of the laissez-faire\nsystem for the previous violent treatment by blistering, purging, and\nbleeding. Similar cures, he would say, are effected now without mes-\nmerism and without medicine. Moreover, the mesmeric cases, both at\nhome and abroad, are recorded-though often fairly cnough for the\npopulareye-with an exasperating lack of technical detail; and the area.\nfrom which confident conclusions can be drawn is thus much restricted.\nIt is disappointing, for instance, to have to pass over case after case of\nextremely rapid healing of violently inflamed knees, just because the\nreporter of them has neglected to state whether the limb had been\nDigitized by Google\n\f&me Higher A8pccts cif MC8meJ\u00b7i811l. 405\npreviously kept quiet, and so leaves it open to suppose that it had not,\nand that simple rest was the cause of the cure. Then the ipsisnma verba\nof the patient are given with rather too serious an air. However\nconscientiously a lady may have \"taken her .\u00a325 worth of Godbald's\nbalsam,\" we find it hard to believe that she ha.bitually \"brought up\nmore nourishment than she swallowed\"; \"leprosy\" is not likely to be\nproduced by drinking cold ~ter while hot; and\" having to walk with\ntwo sticks\" should not be too often a.ccepted as definitely diagnostic of\nrheumatism. It is only fair, however, to say that the circumstances\nwere such as to make certain defects of description almost unavoidable.\nCases which should have been among the best were those which doctors\nhad despaired of, and where naturally no professional opinion was taken\nimmediately before the new treatment began. Such cases were con-\ntributed to mesmeric records either by the successful CI magnetisers,\"\nwho, however honest and benevolent, were not sufficiently alive to the\nimportance of cross-examination; or by the patients themselves, whose\nstyle sometimes did more honour to their hearts than to their heads.\nBut if unfortunate phrases are sometimes used, this is a danger from\nwhich few are exempt when in contn.ct with facts which they know to be\ngenuine, but which they cannot understand; and where there is 0. back-\nbone of strong cases, to decide the more doubtful ones always against\nthe witness would clearly be quite unfair.\nThe canons of evidence which may reasonably be applied to thil'l\nclass of phenomena are such as even laymen may venture to indicate :-\n(1.) The case should be reported throughout by a medical man; or,\nat the very least, there should be a medical man's diagnosis and\nprognosis of the patient's malady before mesmerism is resorted to, and\nsatisfactory evidence of the restoration to health.\n(2.) The case should be reported, as nearly as may be, at the tirol',\nand publicly, so that objectioM may be taken to it before the circum-\nstances are forgotten.\n(3.) The case must be one in which no other form of medical treat-\nment has been concurrently employed.\n(4.) The recovery should be such as cannot reasonably be attributec:l\nto the vis medicatri:l: naturre.\n(5.) The influence of imagination should be, as far as possible,\nexcluded. This can sometimes be done with completeness: as when the\npasses are made upon a. person blind, asleep, delirious, comatose, or\ndemented; or upon an infant or brute beast; or even 011 a person who\nhas never heard of mesmerism, and pays no attention to what is being\ndone. It should be noted, however, that the exclusion is not one which\nthe logic of the case rigorously demands. Imagination is an ingredient\nwhich, though it does not figure in prescriptions, few practitioners would\ncare to see expunged from their list of remedies; and we may grant\nDigitized by Google\n\f406 Some Higller .Aspects Q\/ Mesmerism.\nthat it has often materially assisted mesmerism, just as it has materially\nassisted amulets, bread-pills, and the Pharmacopreia itself. But if the\nheneficial effects, in cases where the patient knew that mesmerism was\nbeing employed, are all to be ascribed to imagination, then mesmerism\nmay, at least, claim the power of evoking the imagination to a degree\nand in a manner in which nothing else has ever evoked it, from\nHolloway's ointment to fragments of the True Cross.\nNow, bearing the above canons in mind, and making every allowance\nfor exaggeration and inaccuracy, we do seem to find a residue of cases\nwhere the evidence of a specific in1luence is hard to controvert, and, at\nany rate, never ltas been controverted in a serious manner. Of this\nresidue we desire to be nothing more than remembrancers. 'Ve are\nfar, indeed, from the presumption of deciding where doctors disagree,\nor rushing in where surgeons fear to tread. Weare not going to say\na single word which either arrogates medical knowledge to ourr,elves,\nor reflects in the slightest degree on orthodox medical practice. We\nshall err, if we err at all, by an even exaggerated deference to the\ndicta of the Faculty. It is true, we know enough of the history of\nmedicine to recall instances, not a few, where novel remedies have run\naway with one and another sane practitioner, whom luck and en-\nthusiasm have enabled to report a list of cures that have somehow\nnever got confirmed by subsequent experience. But the group of\nthe \"mesmerists,\" here and on the Continent, was too large, and\ntheir evidence too concordant, to be easily dismissed on such analogies\nas this. And it does not seem rash to assert that, when a number\nof experienced physicians and surgeons agree in maintaining that in\ncertain cases they have found a certain method of treatment effective,\nwe are primd facie bound to attend to them-yes, even though a.\nstill larger number of physicians and surgeons should denounce the\nfirst set as fools and liars, on the ground that they themselves have\nnot tried the treatment in question, and are certain that if they had\ntried ~t they would have found it absolutely inert. So if some medical\ncontroversialist shall roundly charge us with impudent ignorance for\nholding that, among some thousands of inconJlusive cases, there may\nhe here and there a conclusive one, we shall console ourselves with\nthe re1lection that we are martyrs to our faith in the honour and\nveracity of valious eminent members of his own profession.\n'\"e confess, for instance, that we should \u00b7...ery much like to elicit\nsome serious criticism on the medical careers both of Mr. Braid and\nof Dr. Esdaile. The amount of their success seems to be just one of\nthose facts as to which a kind of \"collspiracy of silellce \" has really\nexisted; and this is the stranger in that Braid's name, as a scientific\ndiscoverer, is now widely celebrated; while Esdaile had the uniquo\ngood fortune to secure the favour of the Governor-Gt'neral of India., to\n\fSome Dig\/ler Aspectll of Mesmerism. 407\ncontrol a. large Government hospital, and to have his reports officia.lly\npublished. It is true that the tide of neglect is beginning to turn;\nbut among living Englishmen, capable of appreciating the significance\nof what these men did, how many could, at this moment, stand an\nexamination in the couple of small and unpretending volumes which\nrecord their work 7 It may, perhaps, be said in reply that Braid was a\nl~ypnotist, who disowned mesmerism; and that, though Esdaile was a\nprofessed mesmerist, yet, as his favourite method of treatment was\ngentle rubbing, his cases fell well within the hypnotic theory, and are\nvalueless in support of mesmerism proper. This excuse for neglecting\nthem, whatever it may be worth, could hardly be made by those-the\nmajority, we think, of the professed opponents of mesmerism even\nin our day-who have never distinguished hypnotic and mesmeric\nphenomena, but haye swept all alike under a common condemnation.\nBut the objection is still worth considering, inasmuch as it suggests\nwhat is really an important fact-that, next to ether and chloroform,\nBraid's great discovery must rank as the chief cause of the collapse of\nthe mesmeric crusade. Having ascertained the genuineness of that\nabnormal state into which sensitive \"subjects\" can be thrown by a\nstrained fixation of their eyes, and having rightly found the immediate\ncause of that state in a profound and peculiar nervous change, Braid\nhad a ready explanation for all his cures. His\" profound nervous\nchange\" was wide and vague enough to cover anything. And\nwhen, in addition to the physical peculiarities of the state, such as\ninsensibility and rigidity, it is observed that the mental condition of\nhypnotised \"subjects\" is often one of marked mono-ideism-of strong\nand one-sided attention-then many familiar experiences come in to\nthe assistance of the hypnotic theory. \"The influence of mind on\nbody \" is a medical common-place; and if there is a state in which the\nmind is abnormally concentrated on the bodily condition, it is in that\nstate that this influence is likely to be at its maximum of intensity. In\nthis way the influmce of attention and expectation, which Braid\nhimself most carefully distinguished from the curative influence of the\npurely nervous change, came after his time to bE an accepted part, and,\nindeed, chief feature, of the anti-mesmeric doctrine.\nBut while the point of Braid's work-the establishment of a unique\nnervous change-was thus, to a great extent, concealed and confused, a\npiece of simple fact, which might well have suggested a truer interpre-\ntation of his results, passed unnoticed and unrecorded; to wit, that\nthose results were not and could not be repeated, even by those who\nmost admired them. The power of fixation of the eye to initiate peculiar\nphysical and mental phenomena did not perish with Braid, and the\nmeans of inducing the hypnotic state have even been considerably\nextended since his death j but his series of cures-which on the hypnotic\n\f408 Some HigllCl' .A..8pt'CtlJ of Me~mlC\";8m.\ntheory, ought to have Leen equalled by any practitioner who chose to\ntake the minimum of pains for the maximum of effect-has not had\nha.lf-a.-dozen rivals in the last 40 years. Even apart from the ulterior\nmedica.l effects, his power of producing what he calls the II nervous\nsleep\" was altogether exceptional; and the number and certainty of his\nsuccesses must; be astounding to all who have had-what he himself\nseems to have lacked-the opportunity for comparing the results which\nhe obtained by what he im8.z:,<>ined to be purely hypnotic II means\" with\nthose of others. And inasmuch as he was careful to avoicl a dogmatic\ndenial of thc possibility of specific II mesmeric\" power, his memory will\nnot be wronged by suggestion that, if that power be a reality, he must\nunknowingly have possessed a considerable share ofit. We have more\nthan once pointed out how little the significance of the rarity of strong\noperative power has been realised, and how feeble have been the\nattempts to account, by such considerations as the temperature and\nmoisture of the hand, for the enormously different degrees in which\ndifferent persons can produce and control tim characteristic hypnotic\neffects. Ancl this argument for the reality of mesmerism will only be\nreinforced and extended if the further phenomena of healing be taken\ninto account. For so far as the evidence goes, it seems that persons of\nstrong curative power are exceptional, even among those in whom the\npower of sending persons into the II magnetic\" sleep is strongly\ndeveloped.\nThe case of Dr. Esdaile is, at first sight, different; inasmuch as he\nemployed many assistants, and found that, with care, they were all\nable to produce the trance\u00b7condition in almost any Hindoo who pre-\nsented himself. Still, the proof of the exceptional susceptibility of the\nIndian temperament to hypnotic manipulation cannot possibly affect\neither the fact that in England similar results can be produced by only\n&. small minority of persons, or the argument from that fact-that these\nexceptional persons possess an exceptional power. And fortunately in\nEsdaile's case such arguments can well be spared; for the proofs which\nhis pages supply, of the reality of the specific influence, are of a far\nmore direct !Iond crucial kind. We may quote a single instance.\nIt may be remembered that in a former paper we recounted some\nexperiments of our own, tending to show that inanimate objects could\nbe imbued with the operator's influence in such a manner as to be after-\nwards detected by a sensitive II subject.\" * Such a phenomenon is,\nindeed, in England, among the rarest that mesmerism presents; and\nthe attribution to the\" magnetisation of an object\" of effects which a\n\u2022 Proceeding', Vol. I., p. 261. The alternative explanation would be\nhyperreetbeaia of (we tbink we may say) a quite unexampled degree, in a\nperson who gave no otber sign of any abnormalities of sensation whatever.\nDigitized by Google\n\fSome Hight'l\" Aspects oj Mesmerism. 409\nfew precise experiments would at once show to be due to the imagina-\ntion of the person who handles it, is one of the commonest of mesmeric\nfallacies. We have seen the fingers of a \"subject\" suddenly cramped\nat the touch of a\" magnetised\" penny, so that he was unable to drop it\neven when offered five pounds to do so; we have seen his whole body\nconvulsed when his finger was dipped into 0. glass of \"magnetised\"\nwater; but the cramp and convulsions were quite equally violent when\nthe previous \" magnetisation \" was a fact having no existence except in\nhis own imagination. With the more sensitive Hindoos, however, the\ngenuine phenomenon appears to have been more readily obtained, and\nEsdaile gives the following account of his application of it to therapeutic\npurposes:-\nFrom multiplied experiments in six different hospitals, I should as 800n\ndoubt the power of fresh water to quench thirst 1\\8 that of mesmerised water to\ninduce sleep, in persons who have already felt the mesmeric influence. Here\nalso it will be said thatsmell and taste, suggestion and imagination, and no ex-\ntraneous influence, produced the result. I repeat that the only experiments\non which I rely were first trial; they were made, at intervals of months\nand years, in six different hospitals, and my test experiments were thus\nconducted: the mesmerised water was medicated with tincture of rhubarb,\ntincture of cardamoms, aromatic spirit of ammonia, &c., and given to the\npatients at their usual time of taking physic, so that it WI\\8 impoBBible to\nexcite suspicion or expectation of anything unusual in them. The result\nWI\\8 that a very large proportion of susceptible subjects were so profoundly\nentranced on the first occasion that they might have been operated on with-\nout pain ; and their unhealthy sores were frequently burned with undiluted\nnitric acid without their feeling it, when sleeping from the effects of mesmer-\nised water. What more effectual precautions could be taken by those who\ndeny any external influence, I cannot in my simplicity imagine.\nAnd here a comment suggests itJ;el\u00a3 for wInch we would specially\nbespeak attention. Why is Esdaile's word to be taken when he tells\nus that he produced anresthesia by hypnotic passes, and not when he\ntells us that he produced anresthesia by \" mesmerised water\" 1* Among\nthe more instructed portion of the medical world, hypnotic a'Tl\u20acfstheBia\nhas come, in recent years, to be an accepted fact. As yet it may be\nonly a few who realise the extent to which the phenomenon can be\ncarried; but the doctrine is finding its way into first-class medical\nhandbooks; and its scientific future is indicated by that clearest sign,\nthat those on whose minrls it has dawned mention it with a fine air of\nhaving known about it all along, and ev('n make use of its sober and\nThere is, however, another possible hypothesis which must not be lost\nflight of,-namely, that the effect, though a real one, was not due to the water,\nbut to the idea in Esdaile's own mind. The case would then be very simila.r to\nsome of the instances given up,low, of the production of the trance by the exercise\nof will\n2 D\nDigitized by Goo\n\f410 Some Higher .AspectB of J\u00a3eBml'l\"iBn1.\northodox character to point a moral against the heretical ,-agaries of\n\"mesmerism.\" Now, to ac<:ept the doctrine of hypnotic anresthesia is\nalmost synonymous with accepting Esdaile as one of the ablest and\nmost trustworthy of modem scientific discoverers: no doctrine coul<l\nwell be more intimately associated with the name of a single man.\nNor do instructed physicians shrink from acknowledging this: among\na skilled minority, the fame of Esdaile now ranks almost on a par with\nthat ot Braid\u00b7 But is it not a little curious that the laudatory notiCf'.8,\nin which he is beginning to figure as one of the great founders of\nhypnotic science, contain no hint of his strenuous and persistent\nadvocacy of mesmerism, still less of the experiments by which he\njustified the faith that was in him 1 Writers who now, for the sake of\ndiscrediting mesmerism, find it convenient to -take their stand on hyp1W-\ntum as an old-established science, with Esdaile for its comer-stone.\nshould at least remember (1) that he was the wamlest champion of the\ncause which they attack; (2) that his \"hypnotic\" and his \" mesmeric ,.\nwork stand exactly on a par as regards eyidence; (3) that for long\nyears even his\" hypnotic\" work received from the\" scientific world\"\nnothing but incredulity and scorn. Is it not, perhaps, easier to suppose\nthat this same scientific world may still faU short of infallibility, than\nthat there were ttvO Esdailes, performing experiments in the same place\nat the same time, one an investigator of extraordinary vigour and skill,\nthe other a credulous dupe, if not a wilful impostor 1\nIt must, however, be admitted that Esdaile's powers as a theorist and\nexpositor were by no means on a par with his courage and practical\nsagacity; and it is not clear that he ever himself distinguished the\ninstances which, like those above quoted, are distinct e\\-idences of\nmesmerism, from the ordinary run of his cases, where anresthesia was\nproduced by monotonous rubbings and passes. The phenomena are all\nmixed up together in his ra~dom talk about the out-flowing of a\n\" nervous fluid,\" which he seems to have regarded as always on tap in\nany healthy human body. Turning from him to his contemporaries in\nEngland, and especially to Dr. Elliotson, we find a similar want of dis-\ncrimination. The pages of the Zoist are permeated by the doctrine that\nthe mesmeric power is one which almost &11 possess in a very appreciable\ndegree; and it is probable that theviolent collision of this doctrine with\nmen's pre-conceptions and experiences did not a little to cast the reality\nof the power into discredit. The magnitude of the claim made could not\nbutbe contrasted with the smallness of the areawith in which it was even\npretended to be justified. In mesmeric hospitals it was not the patients\nbut the healers who were lacking; and though the militant party might\nmaintain that this was only because so fe,,' persons seriously attempted\n\u2022 We refer specially to Dr. Bastian's admirably judicious articles\n.. Braidiam\" and\" llesmemm,\" in Quain's Dictionary oj Medicille.\nDigitized by Google\n\f411\nthe art, yet it is certain tha.t the a.ttempt must have been made again\nand again in a small way, by persons who would only too gladly have\ngone on, had they detected the slightest symptoms of success.* And\nthe cause would have had a sounder basis had this been seen, and its\nmoral acknowledged.\nThe mention of Dr. ElliotBOn suggests a further drawback with\nwhich the mesmeric cause in England had to contend in its most\ncritical hour. The bitter and scornful tone which that fiery champion\nof strange discoveries adopted seems to us to have been as ill-adapted\nas any tone could be to ensure their reception. He should surely have\nremembered that any considerable disturbance of traditional views is\nalmost necessarily received at first with resentment; and that although\nthe man who is merely advertising his own merits may often gain by a\nlittle assumption, the disinterested advocate of new truths will find it\nessential to be almost apologetically urbane. But, nevertheless,\nthough Dr. Elliotson's tone was overbearing, he did most vigorously\nmarshal fact and argument to back it up; whereas his opponents,\nwhose rejoinders (thanks to the almost arrogant candour of the Zoist)\ncan be traced with ease through the medical journals of the time,\nhave certainly not produced counter-statements of a sufficiently\ndefinite kind to dissolve away the nucleus of solid evidence to which\nwe have above referred. The supposed exposure of the Okeys by Mr.\n'Vakley is not now worth discussion; on the Lancet', own showing\nit was one of the hastiest aud clumsiest of all the hasty and clumsy\nattempts which have been made to disprove new phenomena by men\nwho have never condescended to comprehend them. And the rest of the\nsolid opposition resolves itself into an attempt (which on our principle\nof not attempting to decide on any disputed medical point, we may\nreadily count as SUCCf:SSful) to show that in some of the minor cases\nrecorded in the Zoist the conditions which we have above numbered\nas third and fourth were not fulfilled-that is to say, that the patient's\ncure may have been owing to other remedies, or to the operation of\n\u2022 Such incidents as the following-mi\"u8 its happy termination-must have\noccurred often enough during the last forty years. One of the present writers,\nhavin, discovered that a boy with a bad poisoued finger was daily visiting an\namateur mellmerist to have the pain removed, undertook the office of healer,\nand invited the patient to come to his room at the usual time. Every means was\ntaken to impress him with a belief in the superior power and experience of his\nnew operator; and a considerable time was laboriously spent in making the\northodox passes over the inflamed member. Its owner's politeness, and his\nevident struggle to believe that he felt some dift'erenee, were a touching\nspectacle. But the pain was too real for the fiction to be kept up, or the sufferer\nkept waiting; and half-a\u00b7minute of light passes (without contact of any !!Ort)\nfrom his usual operator sent him away smiling, and safe from hie enemy for nt\nleast twelve hours to come.\n2 D 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f412 Some Higher Aspects oj Mesmt>l,;sm.\nnature. These substantive objections cover a small part indeed of the\nfield; but, on the other hand, we find plenty of llUlguage of a kind\nwhich reminds us that lUJat mnst sometimes rank as a very low form of\nenergy. We give a few samples below.*\nDid space permit, it would be easy to multiply indefinitely such\ninelegant extracts, and to show that, however successful the onslaught\non mesmerism in England may have been, there is little in its literature\nwhich can be appealed to with satisfaction by anti-mesmerists of a calmer\n\u2022 \"The mesmero\u00b7mania,\" says one doctor in the Medico-Chil'urgical Rcvieu',\n.. has nearly dwindled in the metropolis into anile fatuity; bnt lingem in BOme\nof the provinces with the gobemonchee and chaw-bacons, who, after gulping\ndown a ponnd of fat pork, wonld, with well-greased gullets, swallow down such\na lot of mesmeric mummery as would choke an alligator... \" We regard the\nabettom of mesmerism as quacks and impostom,\" says the La1ltJd; \"they :lught\nto be hooted ont of professional society.\" The \"subject,\" or, as Mr. Wakley\nmore graphically puts it, \"the patient, alias the victim, alias the particeps\nt:l'imiltu,\" is almost as bad as the operator; and even the man who reads about\nsnch pel-iormances h \" a leper (aie) who mnst be taken with his spots.\" The\nonly doubt seems to be whether we may exult, with the 88Jiguine Lancet, in the\nconviction that\" the brood of mesmerism must in no long time utterly destroy\ntheir own loathsome dam\"; or must tremble with the gentler spirit of Dr.\nRiadore, before the sofUy-fanning manipulator, as\n..

But some practitioners\nappear to have had access to an intuitive knowledge of a yet higher type. \"The\nstrong blasts from the Terrible One,\" says the Apothecary of the Middlesex\nHospital, \"which have swept over my BOllI, as I have read, seen, and heard\nrelated the varied deceptions which have been set forth by the disciples of mes-\nmerism, have fully convinced me that it is an infernal system, whose coming 6\nafter the working of Satan,\" &c., &c., and \"closely allied to that terrific and\nunpardonable sin-blasphemy against the Holy Ghost...\nWe may seem here to have reached a kind of climax. But there is yet one\nremark which deserves citation, as a warning of the perilous confnsion into\nwhich the mind of a professed healer may fall, in the desperate effort to save\nanwur-proprt: and mate an antagonist. Dr. --, objecting before the Medico-\nChirurgical Society to the confirmation of some minlltes which recorded that.\na certain paper had been read-which paper contained an allURion to an\noperation performed under mesmeric anresthesia-contended that, even if this\nlI.CCOunt were trne, \"the fact was unworthy of their consideration; because\npain is a wise provision of natnre, and patients ought to suffer pain while\nthe surgeon ia operating; they are all the better for it, aud recover better,'\"\nUnluckily for himself, Dr. -- ga\"e utterance to thill dogma on the very eve of\nthe discovery of chloroform.\nDigitized by Google\n\fSome Higher .A8pect8 of .LlIc8meri8m. 413\nage;, 'Ve think, indeed, that any unbiassed person who is at the pains\nto study the controversy in detail will feel that, whatever might hav\"\nbeen the effect of better strategy on the other side, and however\npopular, uncritical, and old-fashioned much of the n..esmeric testimony\nmay now look, Bertrand, Petetin, and Elliotson were, at any rate, left\nin possession of the field; and that the prim4jacie case is still in favout\u00b7\nof those who maintain that our sanative armoury has been enriched by\nan agent of singular, though uncertain and limited, power. And if it he\n~nly fitting that the vigour of the scrutiny should be jealously propor-\ntioned to the strangeness of the facts, we still fail to see why the\nresearches into mesmerism, which the general progress of science must\nundoubtedly extend and renew, should be vulgarised on any side by the\nslightest taint of acridity or scorn. In this problem, as in many others\nwhich concern life, it is possible that the final solution may not yet\nhave been surmised by anybody; but there is no reason why all parties\nshould not cordially unite in seeking it.\nIt would be impossible within the limits of this paper to cite\nverbatim 0. sufficient number of cases to give any fair idea of a class of\nevidence whose force must of necessity be cumulative. If only a few\nexamples be considered, however extreme the condition, and however\nrapid the improvement, it might be maintained as conceivable that\nnature had come to the rescue at that precise moment. The impressive\npoints are (1) the strong similarity of cases coming from so many\nindependent quarters, and (2) the perpetually recurring concomitance\nof amendment with the first application of the treatment, of relapse\nwith its casual intermittence, and of steady recovery with its regular\nemployment. The concomitance is far too marked to admit of being\nreferred -like the list of cures which have, from time to time, obtained\nfor a spurious remedy so~~ amount of professional vogue-to luck, to\nrest, or to mal-observation. A careful collation of testimony indicates\npretty distinctly the sort of maladies in which there was found to be\nan appreciable prospect of success. First, in simplicity, though not in\nnumber, come the cases where the benefit is due to the production of\nsleep-whether the benefit takes the negative form of anresthesia\nduring an operation, or the positive one of restoration and revival.\nHere, if we could forget the general argument for mesmerism, drawn\nfrom the rarity of the power to produce the effects, the hypnotic\nbypothesis has most to be said for it. The second class of cases includes\nthe relief and removal of pain of all sorts-whether the results of\naccident, as sprains or burns, or such morbid affections as tooth-ache,\nrheumatism, ani lum!Jn.go. Here, again, the hypnotist would probahly\nrefuse to recognise any special argument for the \"mesmeric\" influence.\nIn cases where both pain and treatment are restrictedly local, he\nmight represent the relief as an inhibitory effect, induced by the gentlo\nDigitized by Goo\n\f414 Bome Hiollel' Aspect8 qf Ne8mtJi8m.\ncutaneous stimulation; seeing that such stimulation is capable of\nthrowing muscles into violent spasms, he might conceive it as equ9.lly\ncapable of influencing the sensory centres. Even so, \"'e might remind\nhim that the relief of pain without loss of sensation is 0. very different\nthing from the production of insensibility, which is the common result\nof hypnotic manipulations. But it would be more difficult to describe\nas purely hypnotic phenomena, cases of relief in deeply-seated affections,\nwhere the treatment was applied neither at the seat of the pain, nor in\nsuch a way as to produce the genernl hypnotic condition. And the\ndifficulty is s~ill further increased in many of the cases of nervous\ndisturbance which form the third great class. That class includes\nneuralgia, chorea, hysteria, some paralyses, perhaps epilepsy, and chronic\nnervous exhaustion in its many perplexing and distressing forms.\nExperience seems to show that instability of nervous condition is itself\na sign of mesmeric susceptibility, the susceptibility ill many recorded\ncascs ceasing with recovery; and it is a satisfaction to think that in\nthis way the weak and hysterical may at any rate reap some benefit\nfrom their peculiarities. Now here, so far from necessary was it that\nthe patient should be \"hypnotised\" by the process adopted, that a.\nslight drowsiness was sometimes the utmost of which he or ahe was\nconscious, 'While on other occasions even this was absent; and Braid's\ntheory of a sudden and profound nervous change as the source of the\ncurative effects-a convenient one as long as insensibility, automatic\nobedience, the transition to coma, and the other striking features of\n11ypnotism, are present to bear wi~ness to its reality-ceases to be\nplausible when the effect perceptible at the time is no more than is\ninduced in scores of instances every day by the sound of the sea, or the\nvoice of the preacher.\nStill, however genuine, mesmerism is neither a panacea, nor (in\nthe medical sense) a specific; while even on the most enthusiastic view\nof its chances with the best-suited cases, the difficulty would remain of\nfinding any considerable number of reliable operators. But there seems\nat any rate no objection to making the search for these as wide as\npossible. The idea .of danget' from the process is supported only in\ncases where it has been most crudely and ignorantly applied. Ranked\non a par with nursing operations, which require sense and care, hut.\nnot talent or education, and performed under due professional superin-\ntendence, we think that it need give rise to no fear or hesitation what-\never. Eamestly, however, as we desire to see the experiment widely and\nsystematically made, we cannot pretend to pre-judge the issue. As far\na, the English race is concerned it may well be that even Dr. Bastian's\ntemperate forecast is over-sanguine; and that, beyond sporadic successes..\nthe curative effect isnot destined to rank as more than one among the\nvarious departments of a more general scientific problem. But on that.\nDigitized by Google\n\fSome Higllt1\u00b7 A.8peet8 of Me8mel'i8m. 415\nground alone it is entitled to 0. place in any discussion, however cursory,\nof mesmeric phenomena.\nWe now pass to our second main topic j the mesmeric effects which\nthe \"subject\" exhibits without any preliminary affection either of his\nsenses or of his ideas j as when the mesmerist, though in the company of\nthe \"subject,\" gives no sign or hint of his intention to exercise his\npower j or when the two are separated, either by a mel'e wall, or by\nthe interval of a few streett!, or by a longer distance. The effects in\nquestion embrace both (1) the definite indu~tion of the mesmeric state,\nand (2) the compulsory performance by the \"subject,\" while in that\nstate, of some act \"willed \" by his con~roller. It may be observed, by\nthe way, that if we examine the question as to the effica.cy of the will\nin cases of ordinary mesmerisation, we find a certain conflict of\ntestimony. Some operators have noted that their passes were in-\neffectual unless accompaniedby distinct intention and volition. The Rev.\nC. H. Townshend made this observation in an experiment with the cele-\nbrated naturalist, Agassiz, whom he was mesmerising while himself more\nor less distracted by the non-arrival of some expected letters. \"Although\nI was at the time engaged in the mesmeric processes to all outward\nappearances as actively as usual, my patient called out to me constantly\nand coincidentally with the remission of my thought, 'You influence\nme no longer j you are not exerting yourself.''' And Dr. Esdaile gives\nthe same account even of the very definite manipulations of his Hindoo\nassistants, where, if anywhere, the effects might have been naturally\nattributed to a purely physical influence. Elliotson, on the other hand,\nasserts that his owh manipulations were often successful, however\nmechanically and inattentively carried out j Bertrand (Du Magnetiame\nA?&imal, p. 241) makes a similar remark j and their view certainly\nseems the most natural one in respect of all cases of hypnotisation\nwhere there is no reason to suppose any specific influence to be at work.\nIn other cases, it would be a very possible al!sumption that the state of\nnervous activity which admits of influencing another nervous system is\none that normally corresponds to a sense of determined effort j and\nthis element, of course, assumes unique prominence in the \"willing\"\ncases which we are now to consider.\nOur first instance shall be from Esdaile (Natural and Nesmeric\nClairvoyance, pp. 227-8.)\nI had been looking for a blind man upon whom to test the imagination\ntheory, and one at last presented himself. I placed him on a stool without\nsaying a word to him, and entranced him in ten minutes without touching\nhim. This man beeam8 so susceptible that, by making him the object of my\nattention, I could entrance him in whatever occupation he was engaged, and\nat any distance within the hospital enclosure. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 My fir\" attempt to\nDigitized by Google\n\f416 Some Higher .A.Rptcts oj N{'smt1\u00b7~In.\ninfluence the blind man was made by gazing at him silently over a wall.\nwillIe he was engaged in the act of eating his solitary dinner, at a distance of\ntwenty yards. Be gradually ceased to eat, and in a quarter of an hour was\nprofoundly entranced and cataleptic. This was repeated at the most\nuntimely hours, when be could not pOBBibly know of my being in his\nneighbourhood, and always with like results.\nWith this case we might compare Reichenbach's account of\nrepeatedly waking a somnambulist by the mere exercise of will (Der\nSemitiw Mm8c'~, Vol. II., pp. 665-6); and another similar instance in\nthe Report of the Committee of the French Royal Academy of Medi.cine,\npublished in 1831. This Committee stated that they could not doubt\nthe reality of the effect produced on one of their subjects by an\ninHuence exercised II without his knowledge and at a certain distance\nfrom him.\" But the instances which they report are less striking\nthan the following. In the Eoiat for April, 1849, Mr. Adams, a\nsurgeon of Lymington (writing some four months after the incidents\noccurred), describes how a medical student, a guest in his own\nhouse, twice succeeded in mesmerising the man-servant of a common\nfriend at a distance of nearly 20 miles, the time when the attempt\nwas to be made having in each case been privately arranged with\nthe man's master. On the first occasion, the unwitting II subject \"\nfell at the time fixed, 7.30 p.m., into a state of profound coma not at\nall resembling natural sleep, from which he was with difficulty aroused.\nHe said that \" before he fell asleep he had lost the use of his legs ; he\nhad endeavoured to kick the cat away and could not do so.\" On the\nsecond occasion a similar fit was induced at 9.30 in the morning, while\nhe was in the .act of walking across 0. meadow to feed the pigs.\nAs regards the further class of cases, wherf' a definite action or\ncourse of action is producfld by silent or distant control, the first thing\nto remark is that many phenomena are popularly referredto this category\nwhich have not the slightest claim to a place in it. There is a popular\nidea that such cases are not rare, and depend merely on strength of will ;\nbut no reliance whatever can be placed on the alleged instances. Science\nhas often exposed-and will probably have often to expose again-the\nfallacy which at.tributes the ordinary successes in the II willing-game\" to\nanything mOl'e than an unconscious reading of lllight muscular hints.*\n\u2022 Even in the II willing\u00b7game,\" however, as we have more than once pointed\nout, exceptional cases occur by which this theory of unconscious guidance appellnl\nto be somewhat severely strained. For instance, in one case that has come to\nour knowledge, tbe blind\u00b7folded .. percipients\" who were willed to do the most\nunlikely things, QII lOon as they were lightly touched by the\" agents,\"\" would\nsuddenly dart off towards the object of the' willing,' passing round the \"arious\narticles of furniture as if seeing them; often 80 rapidly that we (the agentll) could\nnot keep up with them, and 80 detachillg them8elves from our touch. They\nl'tated that they had no' idea of what they were doing, but jelt, as it !!'ere, a\nDigitized by Google\n\fSome Higher '&8ptCt8 01 Me8merism. 417\nAgain, we have probably all of us heard someone claim to have made\nsomeone else look round, in church or theatre, by fixing an intent gaze\non him; but such cases must clearly be reckoned as mere illusions\nof post hoc propter hoc, of success('s noted and failures forgotten.\nEqually fallacious are most of the cases that are claimed as distinctively\n\"mesmeric.\" The common platform exhibition, where a profession is\nmade of \"willing\" a particular person to attend, and he rushes into\nthe room at the appointed moment, is not due to any influence then and\nthere exercised, but is the effect of the command or threat impressed on\nhis mind when in its wax-like condition of trance on a previous evening.\nNor, as a rule, do the cases where\"subjects\" are said to be drawn by their\ncontroller from house to house, or even to a distant towll, prove any\nspecific power of his will, or anything beyond the general influence\nand attraction whi;:h he has established, and which is liable every now\nand then to recrudesce in his absence, and to manifest itself in this\nstartling form.\nVery much rarer are the really crucial cases, where the intended\neffect-theorigination or inhibition of motor-impulses-is brought about\nat the moment by a delibt'rate exercise of volition; but for a certain\nnumber of them the evidence is such as it would be absurd in us-who\nhave ourselves witnessed the phenomena-to reject. Several sets of\nexperiments have been recorded in our Proceedings whereby the\n.. subject's\" power of response to a question was shown to be at the\nmercy of the unexpressed will of his controller-that will being directed,\nduring a long series of trials, in accordance with an arbitrary list of ye8e8\nand noes drawn up by ourselves.* One series of trials conducted by Pro-\nfessOI' Barrett, gave 43 successes without a single failure. In the\nlast six of these trials, the mesmerist, who was a complete stranger to the\n\" subject,\" was at a distance of seventeen feet from him, outside a door,\nthrough a narrow chink in which he received from Professor Barrett one\nor othel' of two cards, containing respectively the words yes and 110. The\nquestion, \"Do you hear me 7\" was every time addressed to the \" sub-\nblind force compelling them to M'taill tkfillite actiOIlB.\" Now, the interesting point\nof this case is that some lpBCific injlutmce seems really to have l..oeen exerted; the\npercipients being considerably exhausted by two or three minute!! of the perfor-\nmance, which also \" gave them a queer ~garl look afterwards.\" The moral,\nfrom a hygienic point of view, is the very one which we are persistently urging\nfrom a ecientific point of view-namely, that the \"willing-game\" should be\nplayed in Borne form which involvu ,uitAer contact nDr 1110t\u00b7tI1lUmt. I,et the\nco willer\" concentrate his thoughts on Borne object (card, name, number, scene,\ntaste, tune, or whatever it may be) which the subject is to name. Records of\n8uCC688ful experiments of this sort are gradually being accumulated; but the\ngeneral acceptation of thought\u00b7transference might be indefinitely hutene(} if we\ncould induce more people to make trials.\n\u2022 Procudillg8 Vol. I\" p, 256; Vol, II., pp. 13-17.\nDigitized by Google\n\f418 Some Higher .AspeCi8 of Me8mt'1\u00b718m.\nject\" by Professor Barrett. To ensure a neutral tone, he took care (after\nthe first 12 trials) not to know himself which of the two cards he\ngave to the mesmerist until a.fter the result, which. according to the will\nthat had been exerted, was either the answer II yes,\" or silence. We have\nnot been equally successful in trials directed to control of movements of\na more visible sort; but we occasionally meet with cases where attempts\nto make people look round, &c.-valueless in the casual form that they\nordinarily assume-have been made the subject of more, careful and\npersistent experiment. The Rev. J. Lawson Sisson, Rector of\nEdingthorpe, North Walsham (whose interest in mesmerism, like that of\n80 many otherl!, lw.gan with the discovery of his own power to aJlevili.te\npain), tells us that he has made several definite trials on sensitive\n\" subjects\" with complete success. When one of these \"subjects\" was\nwalking many yards in front of him, engaged in conversation and totally\nunaware of his attention, \"I could,\" he says, \"by raising my hand and\n10illing it, draw her head quite back.\" Quite recently, we are told, a.\nsimilar power was repeatedly exercised on a. patient by the house-\nphysician of a large London hospital. But it is, of course, far more\nsatisfactory if BOme more marked interference with normal conduct\nC&ll be induced. The following experiment. of Mr. Sisson's was\nperformed on an incredulous la.cly, whose first experience of the subject\nhad been a few moments' subjection to the slightest possible hypnotic\nprocess in the course of the evening.\nConverRation went on to other topics, and then followed a ligbt supper.\nSeveral of the gentlemen, myself among the number, were obliged to stand.\nI stood talking to a friend, against thewall, and at the back of Mias Cooke.\nBOme three or four feet oft' her.

At lilt I said, \"MiBB Cooke, why don't you drink your wine 1\" and\nher I\\DSwer WII at once, .. I will when you let me.\"\nThe Zoi.t contains several well-marked ca.sea of the same kind. Thus\nMr. Barth there records the case of a. patient of his own (Vol. VII.,\np.280).\nWhen she wished to leave the room, I could at any time prevent her by\nwilling that she should stay, and this silently. I could not arrest her pro-\ngrau whilat she WII in motion, but if she stood for a moment and I mentally\nsaid \" Stand,\" she stood unable to move from the spot. If she placed her\nhand on the table I could affix it by my will alone, and unfix it by will.\nIf she held a ruler or paper-knife in her closed hand, I could compel her by\nwill alone to unclose her hand and drop the article.

He\nwas not in the room with me, neitherhad I the slightest idea of his attempt-\ning the experiment. I felt an unaccountable desire to go in a certain\ndirection.\nThe Rev.

Peel. And more remarkable still are the cases of acts performed\nunder the silent control of Mr. H. S. Thompson, of Moorfields, York.\nof which we have elsewhere given one or two instances. The recorders\nof these experiments have unfortunately seldom recognised the need of\nmaking clear to the reader that a11 chance of physical indications was\nexcluded; and it is, we know, difficult to convince perilons not present\nat the time that adequate precautions have been taken. But after a\nlittle experience such precautions are not really difficult to take.\nIt will be observed that we have cited one case where mesmeric\nsleep was induced at the distance of fifty miles; but there is hardly any\nweU-attested record of the induction of acti01l8, when the\" willer\" and\nthe\" willed\" have been further removed from one &.nother than two\nneighbouring rooms. The liability to have definite acts compelled from\na distance, which figures in romance and in the popular imagination as\nthe natural and terrible result of mesmeric influence, is precisely the\nresult for which we can find least evidence. Our friend, Mr. B., how-\never, to whose powers of this kind we have elsewhere referred, ha.s sup-\nplied us with an instance where t.he impulse to action was transferred,\nthough imperfectly, over a distance of five miles. The case is worllt\nquoting, though the agency ca.nnot be shown to have been specifically\nmesmeric.\nOn Wednesday, July 26th, 1882, at 10.30 p.m., I willed very strongly\nthat Miss V., who was living at Clarence Road, Kew, .hould leave any part\nof that house in which she might happen to be at the time, that she should\ngo upatain to her bed-room, and remove a portl'8it from her dressing-table_\nOn the Friday following I received a letter, saying that on tIle above day.\nand at the time above mentioned, Mias V. experienced a strong influence to\ngo and remove 80mething from her dresaing-table, but ahe was not sure as to\nthe exact article. She obeyed the impulse, and removed something, but not\nthe portrait detennined upon by myself.\nAt the time of the experiment, I was at a distance of fiye miles (viz.,\nSouthall, Middlesex) from the lady in question.\nDigitized by Google\n\f420 SOlne Higher Aspect8 of Me8meri8m.\n[This account was drawn up for us in 1883, from an entry in a diary\nwritten immediately after the occurrence.]\nOn Thursday, July 27th, without having seen or had any communication\nwith Mr. B., Mias V. wrote to him lUI follows:-\n.. What were you doing between 10 and II o'clock on Wednesday\nevening 1 If you make me so rest1eBB, I shall begin to be afraid of you. I\np08itively cOllld flot stay in the dining-room, and I believe you meant me to\nbe upstairs, and to move something on my dreBBing-tablc. 1 want to see if\nyou know what it was. At any rate, I am .mre you were thinking some-\nthing about me.\"\nMr. B. then wrote and told MiBB V. that the object he had thought of\n,vas Mr. G.'s photograph. She answered:-\n.. I muat tell you it was not G.'s photo, but something on my table\nwhich, perhaps, you would never think of. However, it was really wonder-\nful how impoBBible I found it to tllitm or do anything until I came upstairs,\nand I 1mew for certain that your thoughts were 1~re; and in fact it seemed as\nif you were very near.\"\n[Miss V., whom we regard as a completely trustworthy witneBB, has since\ngiven an independent account, agreeing with the above in every detail, tQ\none of the present writers, who has also examined the original letters.]\nSimilarly there are a. few cases on record where lUJllucination8 have\nbeen induced by the will of a distant operator. And such exceptional\ncommand of the sensory faculties of another is, from our point of view,\nof even greater interest than the command of his actions; for it forms\na specially convenient link between the ordinary \"thought-trans-\nference,\" which deals wit-h simple and unemotional impressions, and\nthose strong invasions of the senses or the mind by the presence of\nfriends who are really dying or in some unusual state of excitation far\naway, of which we have already given some account (and hope soon to\ngive a much fuller one) under the title of \"Phantasms of the Living.\"\nThe examples which we have already published have heen unconnected\nwith mesmerism. But in the following case, if correctly described, the\n\"apport seems to have been distinctly due to previous mesmerisation.\nMr. John Moule, of Codicote, near Welwyn, who gives the account, is\npersonally known to one of us. He tells us that, as a young man, he\nhad considerable success in mesmerising his friends.\nIn the year 1855 I felt very anxious to try and affect the moat sellSith-e\nof my mesmeric subjects away from my house and unknown to them. I\nchose for this purpose a young lady, a MiBB Drasey, and stated that some\nday 1 intended to visit her, wherever she might be, although the pla.ce\nmight be unknown to me; and told her if a.nything particular ahould occur,\nto note the time, and when she called at my house aga.in, to state if anything\nbad occurred. Olle day, about two months after (I not hanng scen her in\nthe intel'T'al), 1 was by myself in my chemical fll.ctory, Redman'slWw, Mile\nEnd, London, all alone, and 1 determined to try the experiment, the lady\nboing in Dalston, about three miles oft'. 1 !!toad, raised my hands, and\nDigitized by Google\n\fSome Higher Aspects of Mesmerism. 421\nwilled to act on the lady. I soon felt that I had expended energy. I\nimmediately sat down in a chairand went to sleep. I then saw in a dream\nmy friend coming down the kitchen stairs, where I dreamt I was. She saw\nme, and suddenly exclained, .. Oh I Mr. Moule,\" and fainted away.. This I\ndreamt, and then awoke. I thought very little about it, supposing I had had\nan ordinary dream ; but about three weeks after she came to my house, and\nrelated to my wife the singular occurrence of her seeing me sitting in the\nkitchen, where she then was, and that she fainted away, and nearly dropped\nsome dishes she had in her hands. All this I saw exactly in my dream, 110\nthat I described the kitchen furniture and where I sat as perfectly as if 1\nhad been there, though I had never been in the house. I gave many details,\nand she said, \"It is just as if you had been there.\" After this she made\nme promise that I would never do it again, as she would never feel happy\nwith the idea of me appearing to her. Some time after this she left this\ncountry for Australia, and died a few years afterwards.\n[This case is, of course, somewhat weakened by the fact that the intended\ntrial had been mentioned-though some time before-to the \"subject.\"]\nSo much for our second head, which brings us nearly to the end of\nour space. Resen'ing our final topic-clairvoyance-for independen~\ntreatment, we may conclude with a brief summary of the ways in. '\nwhich our review of mesmerism, as so far published, appears to us to\nhave differed from former discussions of the subject. In the first place,\nwhile making a clear distinction between Hypnotism and Mesmerism,\nwe have maintained the independent reality of both sorts of phenomena.\nWe have thus, on the one hand, sep&l\"&ted ourselves from the writers\non mesmerism who, in ignorance of the work of Braid and his followers,\nand judging from purely superficial indications, have confused together\nall the phenomena at whick the ordinary uninstructed person will gape,\nand have attributed to some mysterious agency effects which science\nclearly perceh-es to be due to a peculiar nervous condition, induced by\na particular sort of stimulation. On the other hand, we have equally\nseparated ourselves from the party who find in this peculiar condition,\nand in the mono-ideism and automatic obedience which it entails, a.\nkey to the whole range of the phenomena. For we have both pointed\nout facts in the ordinary path of hypnotic experiment, which had\nnever been faced, or in any way explained by the hypnotic theorists;\nand we have further devised special experiments, as precise as theil-\nown, with the express view of eliminating the factors on which they\nrelied. The complete success of these experiments was too much in\naccordance with the testimony of previous observers to cause us much\nastonishment; our own claim is for the first time to have established\ntheir truly crucial character by carefully distinguishing them from the\ncases to which the hypnotic theory may be reasonably applied, and by\nemphasising which \"hypnotists\" have always seemed to themselves.\nable to refute \"mesmerists.\"\nDigitized by Google\n\f422 Some Higher ABptct8 oj Me8meri8m.\nWe then pointed out how, in many cases, mesmerism seems only to\ndetermine with special certainty events which are found also capable of\nspontaneous occurrence-that the power seems to be that of directing\nand controlling nervous conditions previously observed, or, at any rate,\npreviously existing. In the department of somnambulism the natural\nphenomena are as distinct as the induced, and have been as distinctly\nrecorded; but, as regards the sanative influence of one organism on\nanother, this, until specialised by mesmerism, was, by its very nature,\n80 vague and diffusive that we can, perhaps, point to no more exact\nrecord of it than is contained in the widely-spread popular belief in\nphysical sympathies and antipathies, and in the beneficial influence on\nthe old of contact with the young. The notion of mesmerism as\ndirecting and concentrating influences which yet may assert themselves\nin its absence, was again strongly suggested in the obvious relationship\nwhich the dODlination of an a~ent person by the specific power bears to\nthe experimental cases of thought-transference and \"willing,\" and to\nthe spontaneous cases of telepathic apparitions. And the same notion\nwill find further confirmation in connection with the topic of\nclairvoyance.\nBut our main objoot throughout has been to stimulate rather than\nto expound-to suggest questions rather than to resolt'e them. The\nimmediate need is a far larger body of contemporary evidence. The\nsubject is, no doubt, one which, on its practical side, demands care and\ncaution, but there is no reason why experiments should be confined to\nthe hospital, or even to the\" psycho-physical laboratory.\" Experiments,\nfor instance, in \"community of sensation\" or in \"silent willing\"\ndepend, in no way, 011 the presence of morbid or hysterical subjects,\nand a.re well worth trying by any patient observer who can induce the\nnecessary trance. Some experienced guidance is needed at the outset,\nand such guidance it is one of the objects of the Society for Psychical\nResearch to afford. But it would be 110 grave retardation of science were\nit assumed that this strange '1'11.6tapsychosis was a medical curiosity alone.\nn is much more than this. It is the key which seems likeliest to unlock\nthe mysteries of attention and memory; of sleep, dreams, and halluci-\nnation; of \"double consciousness\" and of religious ecstasy. It is by thus\nthrowing the mental machinery slightly out of gear that we discem the\nsecrets of its adjustment, or (to use 0. more fanciful metaphor) \" the\nsoul that rises in us, our life's star,\" acquires from this displacement a\nsensible parallax, and reveals laws of its motion which direct introspec-\ntion could net'er discover. Those who engage\" in this as in other\nbranches of psychical research must be prepared to face much wearisome\nfailure, much deceptive ambiguity. Yet thus, perhaps, may they with\nmost reason hope to lay the comer-stone of a valid experimental\npsychology. and to open up our deepest inlet into the inner man.\nDigitized by Google\n\fSome HigAer .&speCtB of NeBmm-iBm. 423\n[Since the above paper was written, the views therein expreued con-\ncerning the existence, limits, and varieties of mesmerism, 8.1 a thera-\npeutical agency, have received remarkable and unexpected corroboration from\nsome results which had not been made public in Englandat the time that we\nwrote. The origin of the important hypnotic work at the town of\nNancy, in France, dates from many yea.ra back, wben Dr. Li~bea.ult\nfirst established himself there in private practice. His labours have\nof late yea.ra received recognition from the authorities of the medical\nschool; and in the H3pita.1 Civil, for the first time since the daye of\nElliotaon and Eada.ile, hypnotism is now being practised on a large acaJe by\na physician of repute. Profe880r Bernheim is preparing a second edition\nof his book, \"La. Suggestion Hypnotique,\" in which his recent observa-\ntions on the therapeutical a.apect ot the subject will be included.\nThrough his kindnell, and that of Dr. Li~bea.ult, we have ourselves witnessed\ntheir methods ;and, in company witb Dr. A. T. Myers, have examined many\nof their patients. The conclusions to be drawn seem to be com-\npletely congruous with those which, in the foregoing article, we have\nderived from the earlier recorda. The succell attained hu, in the very large\nmajority of instances, consisted in the relief of pain and the removal of\nfunctional disturbances-that is to aa.y, in results which (8.1 we have pointed\nout) afFord little if any proof of a specific or \"mesmeric\" iniluence; and Dr.\nLi~bea.ult\u00b7s work,.\"Du Sommeil et des Etats Analogues,\" published in 1866, is\nin fact opposed to tbe \"mesmeric\" hypothesis. But further experiences,\nespecia.lly with very young children, have now convinced him that the\nhypothesis which we have advocated in respect of a certain residue of\nca.aes is fully justified, and that a specific influence is in some cases exer-\ncised; and this view he ha.a with great condour expreaaed in a recent\ntra.cta.te, \u2022\u2022 La ZoomagntStisme.I\nIn view of the Nancy record, it might seem that tbe prospects of this\nform of treatment were, after a.11, rather brighter than we have supposed.\nBut we are bound to add that the remarks made above in relation to Esdaile's\nHindOOl, 8.1 to di1l\"erences of susceptibility in di1l\"erent natiollll, appear to a.\nvery considerable extent to hold good of the French temperament, 8.1 com-\npared with the English. A far larger proportion of patients are distinctly\naffected ill the Nancy warda than our own English experience would have\nled us to anticipate. At the aame time, what we saw there cannot but\nincrea.a& our desire to see the aame line of experiment boldly entered upon,\nor at any rate fairly recognised, by English medical men. .No patient has\never been the worse for it; and the a.11eviation in certain ca.aea seema to be\nof a more pronounced kind than is wely attainable in any other way.]\nDigitized by Google\n\f","_id":531}
