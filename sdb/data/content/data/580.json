Schrenck-Notzing, M.D., Munich.\n(Translation revised by the Author. )\n\" The subtilty of Nature is many times greater than the subtilty of the senses\nand of the understanding.\"\u2014Bacon, Novum Organum, Bk. 1, 10.\nI.\u2014Introduction.\nIf it be true that one brain can impress another without the\nintervention of the known organs of sense, there is no doubt that a\ndiscovery of great and far-reaching importance has been made. And\nif, after the discovery of the chain of physical causation, at present\nunknown to us, but certainly existing, the centrifugal effects of vivid\nideas in one person produce in another, in exceptional cases, sense\nperceptions extending beyond the limits of our ordinary experience,\nour knowledge of the functions of the brain would thereby be much\nenlarged. It is possible also, however unlikely it may seem, that there\nis in the numerous and careful observations now being made some\nindication of a latent source of error, which has hitherto escaped us\nand all other investigators, and which would afford some quite simple\nexplanation of the occurrences in question. But if so, such a discovery\nwould be an important step forward, and would put an end to many\n,errors. In the time of Galvani, it would have been impossible to\nforetell that the present immense development of the application of\nelectricity would result from his observations on the twitching of a\nfrog's leg. And as little is it possible to foresee the future of our\nbranch of investigation, now in its earliest infancy; for the beginnings\nof a new science are often so trivial that they are easily underrated, or\neven rejected d. \"priori when they do not fit in with old systems. But\neven though the subject before us may seem at the first glance to have\nno connection with recognised branches of science, that is no reason for\nturning away from it. On the contrary, only serious critical examina\ntion of experiments made with suitable persons, and careful observation\nof the phenomena which occasionally present themselves spontaneously,\nwill enable us to distinguish truth from error, and to settle the question\n,as to the reality of the alleged facts; and, above all, to banish the\nthick fog of charlatanry and superstition with which human credulity\nand religious enthusiasm have enveloped the phenomena of thought-\ntransference, telepathy, clairvoyance, &c.\nWe certainly do not underrate the great difficulties which beset\nscientific investigation in this domain. Everywhere self-deception.\n\f4 Baron von Schrenck-N'otzing.\nneeds guarding against more carefully than in other branches of\nscience. Everywhere, besides the ordinary sources of human error,\nthere are some quite special to the subject. In order to advance the\nknowledge of psychical processes, in this direction, and to win a new\nand fruitful field for scientific work, we must, firstly, aim at the careful\nobservation and record of each individual case, with the utmost possible\nregard to known causal connections ; and, secondly, endeavour to assign\nto it its place among a large number of similar phenomena, arranged in\ngroups, where each individual case, whether it be an experiment or an\nobservation of a spontaneous event, must be classified with equal\nexactness.\nThe question of psychical action at a distance, apart from the\nexperience and conviction of individuals, appears to be still an open\none for science, in Germany at least. But if thought-transference,\nin the sense of the greater part of the observers, does not exist, there\nis certainly apparent thought-transference; and even so the duty\nof scientific investigation is clear. For in any case a careful study of the\nphenomena might greatly enlarge and enrich our knowledge of the\naction of the human mind.\nNow, in spite of careful consideration of all accompanying circum\nstances and possible sources of error, a number of cases of apparent-\nsuggestion mentale remain unexplained, as the excellent investigations\nof the Society for Psychical Research show. For the range of the\nsources of error has quite definite limits. If, for example, every kind\nof internal expression, of thought is accompanied, as Jackson and\nStrieker have both shown, by the execution of a definite movement ;\nif, further, we assume that the unintentional expressive movement, the\ninvoluntary unconscious suggestion, may sometimes, in spite of the\nmost careful precautions, betray a part of the mental wish; still the\nassumed operation of this factor in the reproduction of drawings when\nagent and percipient are in the same room, is not even an approximately\nadequate explanation of the occasionally striking agreement between\nreproduction and original ; and least of all is it so in those cases in\nwhich it is precisely the deviation from the original which proves the\nthought-transference. My experience, like that of Richet and others,\nshows that sometimes the half successful experiments\u2014those, for\nexample, in which only the fundamental principle or element, or only\nthe form of the original has been grasped\u2014are more instructive and\nconvincing than the completely successful ones. Take, as an instance,\nthe case where the original drawing is a star. The reproduction in\none, two, and three attempts gives the fundamental element of the star\n\u2014the form of a W. Can we suppose that the percipient, in such a case\nof successful transference, read the W in the expression of the agent,\nwho was thinking not of a W, but of a star ? Or should we suppose\n\fExperimental Studies in Thought-Transference, 5\nthat the percipient really perceived the star, but with refined and\ndeliberate artfulness did not reproduce the true figure, but only its\nmain lines slightly altered 1 One supposition is, in this case, as improb\nable as the other, and the second falls to the ground altogether, when\nthe same result is observed with several percipients unknown to each\nother. In general the psychical echo\u2014the transformation which the\nthought undergoes when reconstructed in the brain of a percipient\u2014\nis of great interest, and it may be quite decisive as to the evidential\nvalue of an experiment.\nA further and often neglected source of error, upon which the\nAmerican Society for Psychical Research has justly insisted, is a\n\"corresponding association of ideas in agent and percipient. But this\nalso has definite limits. It is of no importance in experiments in\nwhich the thing to be done is decided by lot. And it is also out of the\nquestion in cases in which it can be shown that the cause which\ndetermined the choice of the object to be thought of was not common\n,to the brains of both agent and percipient, or at least that the per\ncipient was not influenced by it. If, for example, I vividly imagine to\nmyself some object in my room, my attention may have been excited\nby the object itself, and the percipient, being in the same room, may\nguess what it is at the moment when I look at it, from some change in\nmy expression connected with its arresting my attention. But this\n,objection falls to the ground if the process in the mind of the agent\ntakes place as follows: I wish to choose some object in the room to be\nguessed; I keep my eyes fixed on a particular spot, and wander round the\nloom in imagination. My mental eye fixes itself on a basket on the\nwall behind me, in which there is an Indian handkerchief. The whole\nwall is covered with all sorts of things, a large bookcase stands against\nit, and many objects in daily use, pictures, and so on, are there. Now,\nI ask, how is it possible that the percipient should guess from my\nexpression that I am thinking of that Indian handkerchief 1 Even\nsupposing that I made some movement when I fixed on that idea, how\ncould the movement be rightly interpreted ? A movement involun\ntarily made, in spite of efforts to the contrary, could at most have\nbetrayed the neighbourhood of the object, the whole wall, that\nis, where there were hundreds of things besides the one thought\nof. Whence comes it, then, that from this supposed movement,\nunconscious, but perceived and rightly interpreted by the per\ncipient, she names exactly the right object out of hundreds ? It\nis impossible that she should divine the nature of the object to be\nguessed from a gesture only.\nI must, in the present state of knowledge, regard a successful\nexperiment of this kind as tending to prove thought-transference, till\nsome opponent has given experimental proof that the nature of a\n\f6 ,' Baron von Schrenck-Notzivg,\ndefinite object thought of can be recognised from expression or gesture\nalone. The same holds good of an experiment in which I think of\nsome person, and the percipient does not name that person, but another\nperson who lives in the same house, it being the image of the house\nthat first came before my mind's eye. Is it possible, I ask, that the\nexpression which accompanies the thought of a particular person or\na particular house has some special character, not belonging to other\ngestures, by which the percipient recognises the right idea? Such a\nspecial and recognisable character of gesture or expression is not known\nto exist, and is not an admissible explanation, so long as its possibility\nis not proved. Till then such coincidences are to be explained as\nthought-transference; and I therefore feel bound to relate these experi\nments, especially as they form an interesting parallel with experiments\nat a distance and under other conditions. And in experiments of\nwhich various explanations are possible it is just the observation and\nrecord of the little accessory circumstances which make the experiment\nworth anything, and leave the reader free to form a judgment and to\ndecide whether it is possible to relegate this or that experiment to the\nrealm of pseudo-thought-transference.\nThe problem of mental suggestion is for us an open question ; we\nhave no prejudice in favour of any hypothesis, and are accessible to any\ninformation that may throw light on the subject. In what follows we\nconscientiously communicate our observations, both positive and\nnegative, according to the records made in all cases during the experi\nments. If one or another of the cases could perhaps be explained\naccording to principles already known, there would still remain enough,\nwe think, to constitute unexceptionable evidence in favour of the reality\nof true psychical transference.\nII.\u2014Experiments in Thought-Transference with Drawings.\n1st Experiment.\u2014January 15th, 1890. Between 3 and 4 p.m.\nPlace, the author's room (see plan at the end of the paper). Agent,\nthe author. Percipient, Graf S., aged 20. While Graf S. is sitting in\nthe armchair (marked 4 on the ground-plan of my study), I go into the\nnext room, and, the door being closed, make the drawing marked 1 (see\nplates at the end of the paper) at the little table e. I then return\nto the study, where Graf S. is waiting. The drawing is held in\nsuch a manner that it was absolutely impossible for the percipient to\nsee anything of it. Graf S., completely awake, and sitting in the arm\nchair, has his back to the writing-table. I sit down at the writing-\ntable, on the chair marked 3, and think as vividly as possible of the\ndrawing I have made, but holding it so that Graf S. could have seen\nnothing of it, however he might have turned himself. Without giving\nhim any indication of what my drawing is, I ask him to draw. He\n\fExperimental Studies in Thought-Transference. ?\nmakes the reproduction marked 1 . My behaviour could not have given\nhim the least hint. Time of experiment, two minutes.\nThe original and reproduction have only the right angle in common.\nI put this experiment down as a failure.\n2nd Experiment.\u2014January 15th, 1890. Between 3 and 4 p.m.\nAgent, the author. Percipient, Graf S. Process and arrangement of\nexperiment exactly as in Experiment 1. I prepare the original in the\nnext room. I can answer for it that the percipient did not see my\ndrawing. No sort of hint was given. The percipient sat in the arm\nchair, the agent at the writing-table. Nothing was said. The experi\nment lasted about two minutes. Graf S. drew reproduction 2. In\nneither of these experiments did I look at the hand of the percipient.\nI consider the experiment successful. The percipient drew a\ncrescent-shaped segment of a circle, something like a moon. If the\npoint which I discussed in the introduction should be raised, whether\nsome unperceived cause may not have made both of Us think of a\ncircle, I would observe that this can hardly apply to the more thickly\ndrawn section of my circle, and only this was perceived. The point of\nthe crescent running upwards into a line shows that the crescent\ndoes not quite reproduce the whole figure. With regard to conditions I\nconsider this experiment unassailable. (Cf. original and reproduction 2. )\n3rd Experiment.\u2014January 21st, 1890. Between 4 and 5 p.m.\nPlace, my study. Agent, the author. Percipient, Graf S. Arrange\nments in every particular the same as in Experiments 1 and 2.\nJust as I am leaving the room to make the drawing, I think of a\nsquare, but draw a triangle. Baron v. Welden is present at this\nexperiment; the arrangements have been carefully explained to him,\nand he endeavours not to influence the proceedings. During the\nexperiment he sits on a lounge behind me, and looks at the drawing\nwith me. The percipient could see nothing, even if he turned, on\naccount of the way the paper is held. No hints are given. Graf S.\ndraws reproduction 3. Duration of the experiment, about two minutes.\nAlthough, on account of the presence of three persons, and the con\nsequently increased difficulty of control, I feel more hesitation about\nthis experiment, yet I do not at all believe that it was possible for the\npercipient to observe anything. We did not look at his paper while he\nwas drawing, and were quite silent. The experiment may be considered\na success. (Cf. original and reproduction 3.)\nith Experiment.\u2014January 21st. Circumstances and conditions the\nsame as in Experiment 3. Graf S. draws a cup instead of the number 1.\nThe experiment is a failure, in spite of a certain likeness\u2014a stem and\nsomething on it\u2014in both. But the kind of failure is interesting. (Cf.\noriginal and reproduction 4.)\n\f8 Sawn von Schrenck-Notzing.\n5th Experiment.\u2014January 21st. , The same circumstances and con\nditions as in the last, except that Baron v. Welden acts as agent. He\ndraws original 5 in the next room. He sits on the lounge and looks\nat the drawing, while the percipient draws, sitting in the armchair. I\nam a passive witness, know nothing of the original, and refrain from\nany participation. The conditions again appear to me strict. I could\ndiscover no hidden error, in spite of careful observation. Graf S.\ndrew reproduction 5, a comet. Although the experiment is a failure,\nstill the analogy of two small circles, with something larger attached\nto them in both cases (in one case the larger circle, in the other the\ntail), is striking. Duration of experiment, about three minutes. (Cf.\noriginal and reproduction 5.)\n6th Experiment.\u2014Time, place, and conditions as in Experiment 3.\nAgent, the author. I draw a 3 with thick lines in the next room.\nGraf S. says that he does not know what he has to draw. Even a\nhint from me, \" I am thinking of a number,\" does not put him on the\ntrack. This experiment fails completely.\n7th Experiment.\u2014January 20th, 1890. 4.30 p.m. Place, my study.\nPercipient, a patient of mine, Fraulein E., 24 years old, suffering from\nhysterical troubles. Conditions of experiment :\u2014I draw the original\non the table e in the next room, with closed doors, while the percipient,\nquite awake, is sitting in the armchair (4) in the study. I go back\nto my study and sit down at the writing-table, without showing the\ndrawing or giving any hint, and always holding the paper so that\nnothing can be seen. I do not look at the drawing Fraulein E. is\nmaking till she has finished. When she gives me the drawing she\nspontaneously makes the following remark, which I took down\nword for word. \" I see a cross which persists, and is sometimes\nsurrounded by a square, sometimes by a circle, sometimes by a\nborder or frame. The frames wavered, but the cross remained.\" I\nonly now show her the original. The experiment is to be regarded\nas successful, and the conditions seem to me strict ; unless I uncon\nsciously gave indications in spite of efforts to the contrary, which I do\nnot believe. (Cf. original and reproduction 6.) Duration, hardly one\nminute after my return from the next room.\n8th Experiment.\u2014January 20th, 1890. All the circumstances and\nconditions the same as in the previous experiment. In Experiments 8,\n9, and 10 the reproduction was begun directly I re-entered the room,\nall in the interval between 4.40 and 5.15 p.m. In this case, Fraulein E.\nbegan to draw as I opened the door, and I had hardly seated myself\nbefore she had finished the drawing, and believing it to be incorrect\nbegan the two others by it. It was absolutely impossible for her to\nhave seen anything of the original ; for she must have grasped the idea\n\fExperimental Studies in Thought-Transference. 9\nof a square as I was going to open the door. I cannot say whether\nsome hidden cause may not have called up in both our minds by\nassociation so common a figure as a square. But in this case there\nassuredly was apparent thought-transference.\nFraulein E. explained about her drawing\u2014\"After the square,\nwavering, changing figures came into my mind ; first intersecting\nsquares, then right angles, then circles,\" &c. (Cf. original and\nreproduction 7.)\n9th Experiment.\u2014January 20th, 1890. All circumstances as\nin the last experiment, with the difference that I stood behind the\narmchair while Fraulein E. tried to reproduce the figure I had drawn\nin the next room. When she had drawn reproduction 8a, I said\nit was wrong, and she had better try again. No other word was\nspoken. She now drew reproduction 86 under my eyes, and it is\npossible that I expressed my assent by unconscious gestures, when the\nfirst open circle was drawn. But certainly this circumstance could not\nhave indicated to her that she should put another open circle, in which\nthe reproduction shows a remarkable deviation from the original, upon\nthe first. If this experiment is not quite so strict as some of the\nprevious ones, the reproduction is too characteristic to be explained\nby any of the sources of error mentioned above. (Cf. original and\nreproduction 8.)\n10th Experiment.\u2014Conditions exactly the same as in the 9th. I\nstand behind the percipient's armchair, concentrate my thoughts on the\ndrawing I have made in the next room, and look from time to time at\nthe percipient's hand while she is drawing. To reproduction 9a I say\n\" Wrong.\" To reproduction 96 I say nothing. I leave the percipient\nto follow entirely the course of her own thoughts, and she adds\nreproductions 9c and 9<f. She says, \"I keep seeing something like a W;\nnow and then something I cannot recognise comes in.\" This experi\nment, like the previous one, lasted but a few minutes. I only showed\nthe percipient the original\u2014which represents a star composed of three\nW's\u2014after, without further remark from me, the five reproductions\nhad been finished. The reproduction, which is only partial, is, it is true,\nnot a success, but it is a kind of failure strongly indicative of the mode\nof transference. I do not venture to decide whether some hidden\nerrors, some unconscious suggestion on my part, had any share in it.\nI have here conscientiously related only what I believe that I observed.\nWth Experiment.\u2014August 31st, 1890. 9 p.m. Percipient, Fraulein\nA., a patient of rather hysterical temperament, fully awake. She has\nnever before taken part in such experiments. Agent, the author.\nPlace, my study. Conditions exactly the same as in the earlier experi\nments. In this and in all the succeeding experiments I made the\n\f10 Baron von Schrenclc-Notzing.\ndrawings on the table in the next room, with closed doors, and care\nfully concealed them from the percipient on my re-entrance. Percipient\nsits on chair 5, with her back to the door, and draws, while I sit in\nthe armchair opposite her, holding the paper on a book, the book held\nperpendicularly to the floor, with its back towards the percipient and\nthe paper towards me. It is absolutely impossible for her to see the-\ndrawing. Nothing is said. Fraulein A. draws a square, puts down\nthe pencil, and leaves off. Then only I look at her paper and see that\nthe figure is correct. I ask her to go on, saying that the figure is.\nright so far, but not finished. She now completes the figure by adding,\ndiagonal lines and draws a large dot, which is almost like a small\nsquare, in the middle. When she has put down the pencil I show her\nthe original; on the whole it agrees with the reproduction: both figures\nare squares, both enclose something\u2014the original another concentric\nsquare, the reproduction a large central dot with several clearly\nrectangular corners. I consider the experiment a success on the whole,\nand from the experimental procedure I do not think that any\nunobserved error is the cause of the remarkable coincidence. Duration,\ntwo minutes. (Cf. original and reproduction 10.)\n12th Experiment.\u2014August 31st, 1890. 9 p.m. Persons taking part,\nconditions, <tc, same as in the preceding experiment. Complete\nfailure. (Cf. original and reproduction 11.)\n13th Experiment.\u2014October 1st, 1890. 5.50 p.m. Place, my study.\nPercipient, Frau Eug., a Pole, aged 27 ; it was her first experiment of\nthe kind. I sit upon chair 4, the percipient on chair 5. As I\nwanted, in the first instance, to discover whether the patient was\na suitable subject for such experiments, I drew a 3 on a sheet of paper\nunder the table, which was covered with a large cloth. The lamp was\nalight. Frau Eug. could not possibly know what I had drawn. Nothing\nwas said. She made a B without any pause for reflection, and was\nastonished when she saw its likeness to the original. Although the\nconditions were not so strict as in some of the preceding - experiments,\nthe astonishing agreement of original and reproduction can hardly be\nexplained by chance or mistake. This was the only experiment in\nwhich the drawing was made in the same room. It hardly aimed at\nbeing a real experiment, but was made rather for my own information.\nIt lasted from 5.50 to 5.53 p.m. (Cf. original and reproduction 12.)\nlilh Experiment.\u2014October 1st, 1890. 5.55 p.m. Place, the\nauthor's study. Percipient, Frau Eug, sitting at the table on chair 5.\nAgent, the writer. The original (No. 13) was prepared in the next\nroom, with closed doors, and was carefully concealed from the per\ncipient. I sit upon chair 4, and hold the paper covered by a book as\nin the 11th experiment. Before we begin, I say to the percipient, \" It\n\fExperimental Studies in Thought-Transference. 11\nis not a number.\" That and no more was said. The percipient now\ndraws reproduction 13a. I look at her hand, and when she has done\nsay, \" Right, but it is not finished ; draw larger.\" The percipient\ndraws reproduction 136. I say nothing, but picture the original very\nclearly and vividly to myself. The percipient now draws reproduction\n13c, which completely corresponds to the original. Time, five minutes.\nIt is remarkable that the right idea came suddenly to IYau Eug., after\nfigure 136 had completely deviated from the original, in spite of my\nwords at reproduction 13a. I think the course of this experiment very\nworthy of notice, because it shows that in spite of confirmatory words\na wrong drawing may be made. As every detail of this experiment is\nrelated with exactness, I think I need not allude to explanations by\nchance or by hidden defects. (Cf. original and reproduction 13.)\n15<\/t Experiment.\u2014October 1st, 1890. 6.5 p.m. Same circum\nstances and conditions as in 14th experiment. The percipient says, \"I\nam restless ; I cannot do any more.\" \"While speaking she makes\nreproductions a, b, c, d, and then asks, \"Is it not a number, a zigzag,\na letter 1 \" It is possible that as this went on I made some negative\ngesture. Suddenly she says, \" It is a square.\" I say, \" Right.\" She\nnow draws unexpectedly under my eyes lie, which completely repro\nduces the original. She might have guessed the square. But it is\ncertain that there was absolutely nothing to suggest that the figure\nwas to be completed by 4 small squares at the corners. I am thoroughly\nconvinced that she could not have divined from my looks what com\npletion was desired, even if she really had perceived that the square\nwas not all that was wanted. The percipient exhibited the same\npeculiarity as in the last experiment\u2014the right thought came suddenly\nafter wrong guesses, and also the figure really reproduced the original\nexactly.\nIt is true that these experiments are not irreproachable, because\nsomething was said, and if they stood alone I should never think\nthem convincing. But one learns most from these half successes, for\nthey form a transition to the complete ones. (Cf. original and\nreproduction 14.)\n16th Experiment.\u2014October 14th, 1890. Place, my study. Time,\n5 p.m. Persons, conditions, and circumstances the same as in the 1 4th\nexperiment. Original drawing 15 made in next room, with the door\nshut. The percipient guesses, \"It is like a tower, square at the\nbottom\u2014a ball.\" She draws reproductions 15 a, b, c, d. \"It is like\na pedestal.\" She then draws reproduction 15e,\u2014which has a distant\nresemblance to the original. The expressions, \"like a tower,\" \"a ball\nunderneath,\" and \"like a pedestal,\" should be noticed. These descrip\ntions recall the ship's mast of the original, which sticks up like a\n\f12 Baron von Schrenclc-Notzing.\ntower or a pedestal. The ship itself might be thought of as half a\nball. In this way the words show some connection with the original.\nWhether my expression indicated dissent at reproductions 15a-e, or of\niissent at 15c?, I cannot say. This unconscious suggestion was, no\ndoubt, possible. I think this, in any case, an interesting failure. I\nlooked at the percipient's paper while she drew. Duration of the\n,experiment, about five minutes. (Cf. original and reproduction 15.)\n1lth Experiment.\u2014October 15th, 1890. From 10.12 to 10.14 p.m.\nPercipient, Fraulein A. Agent, the author. Place, my study. Con\nditions :\u2014Agent and percipient are in different rooms, separated by a\nwall and a closed door. The percipient is sitting on chair 5, in the\nstudy, quite awake, as are all the persons in all these experiments.\nPaper and pencil are on the table before her. She has her back\nto the door into the next room. I am at the table e in this\nnext room, with my back to the door of the study, and draw\non the table, standing, original 16, the staff of .\/Esculapius with\nthe serpent. Door of communication closed. I call \" Ready 1 \" The\npercipient says, \" Yes.\" We have been drawing at the same time in\ndifferent rooms. On returning to the study I compare the drawings\nand see with astonishment that Fraulein A. has drawn a serpent.\nEven the open mouth and the thickened end of the tail in the reproduc\ntion agree with the original. The experiment has succeeded in its\nessential part, and as regards strictness of conditions I think it quite\nunassailable. Unconscious suggestion is absolutely excluded, when\nagent and percipient are in different rooms. Any corresponding\n-association of ideas seems to me also impossible, for the idea of the\nstaff of j9\u00a3sculapius first occurred to me in the other room. In the\nstudy there is no object which could have led up to the idea,\u2014no\nindication which could have pointed out the way.\nThis experiment is one of my greatest successes. Any hidden\n,error is inconceivable ; the only alternatives are chance, or true thought-\ntransference. (Cf. original and reproduction 16.)\n18th Experiment.\u2014October 15th, 1890. From 10.18 to 10.20 p.m.\nSame persons, conditions, and circumstances as in 1 7. The experiment\nis a complete failure. The idea of a serpent-form seemed to persist in\nthe percipient's mind. Hence the serpentine line. (Cf. original 17\nand reproduction 17.) Only the arrow-like point of the reproduction\nat all recalls the original.\n19th Experiment.\u2014October 15th, 1890. 10.21 to 10.23 p.m.\nPersons, conditions, and circumstances as in 17. I draw the original\n18 on table e in the next room, with the door closed. The drawing\nwas done in the following way. I began with the triangle, and then\n,drew the perpendicular on the base. The idea that thereupon occurred\n\fExperimental Studies in Thought-Transference. 13\nto me, that the figure was too simple, induced me to add a circle and\nto prolong the perpendicular to the circumference ; finally I added the\nhorizontal diameter. The percipient was drawing at the same time at\ntable 5, sitting on chair 5, with her back to the closed door of\ncommunication. Question from the next room, \" Are you ready 1 \"\nAnswer, \"Stop,\" as I am about to open the door. Then, \"Now.\" I\nopen the door and enter the room. The two drawings agree except\nthat the circle and the horizontal diameter are wanting. Even the\nperpendicular of the triangle, which has become obtuse angled, is\nprolonged beyond the base, just as in the original. This prolongation\nand addition of the perpendicular cannot be explained by any tendency\nof ideas to recur (diagram-habit). Only the fact that a triangle was\ndrawn might, taken alone, be explained in some such way. I consider\nthis experiment also convincing as regards the strictness of its arrange\nment, and, on the whole, successful. (Cf. original and reproduction\n18.) The experiments 17 and 19 are the best of the whole series here\ngiven.\n20th Experiment.\u2014October loth, 1890. 10.25 to 10.30 p.m.\nSame conditions, persons, &c, as in Experiment 17. I draw a five of\ndiamonds in the next room ; reproductions 19a, b being drawn at the\nsame time, with the door closed. I look at them without showing the\noriginal to the percipient, say \" Wrong,\" and sit down on chair, con\ncentrating my thoughts on the original, which I hold as I did in Experi\nment 11. Without any hint from me, reproduction 19c is drawn. The\npercipient says, \"I can do no more,\" and makes an oval, I9d, which shows\nme that she has again been drawn from the right track. This experi\nment is a failure, but the mode of failure is noteworthy. The original\nwas a card with 5 pips [in the German stars], of which the centre one\nattracts the eye most. Reproductions 19a and 196 show that the idea\nof a star had come into the mind of the percipient, and been shaped by\nher imagination. Reproduction 1 9c shows two quadrangles with centres,\ndomino-like, which exhibit an unmistakable analogy with the original.\nFor the original is also a four-cornered figure with a centre ; only the\ncentre is four-cornered also, and there is, moreover, another diamond in\neach corner. All through there is some connection of ideas,\u2014a, a star,\nb, a star, c, 2 quadrangles with centres domino-like. Original a five of\ndiamonds. The experiment, unimportant by itself, forms, with Experi\nments 17 and 19, a remarkable group. Note particularly that Experi\nments 17 to 20 were done one after another in half an hour, with the\nsame percipient and under almost the same conditions throughout. It\nis hardly possible to express arithmetically the chances against the\nfortuitous correspondence of so many details in only 4 experiments,\nunder such strict conditions. It is only by comparing with this result\n^he infinite number of mere guesses required to produce the same\n\f14 Baron von Schvenck-Notzing.\namount of coincidence that one can estimate the importance of these\nexperiments. (Cf. original and reproduction 19.)\n21\u00bbt Experiment.\u2014October 17th, 1890. 11.10 a.m. Place, my\nstudy. Agent, the writer. Percipient, Graf S., as in Experiments\n1 and 2. Conditions for reproduction 20a the same as in Experi\nment 17. On re-entering the room I say \"Wrong,\" without show\ning the original. Graf S. now makes reproductions b, e, sitting at\nthe table, on the chair marked 5, I standing behind him looking at\nwhat he draws. A certain resemblance in the circular lines to the\nhandle and the upper rim of the mug cannot fail to be recognised.\nWhen I show the original to the percipient, he says (too late), \" I\nthought of crockery.\" I consider this experiment a failure. (Cf\noriginal and reproduction 20.) Duration, five minutes.\n2'2nd Experiment.\u2014October 17th. 11.15 a.m. Everything arranged\nas in Experiment 17. I draw in the next room an anchor. The per\ncipient draws as reproduction a, two concentric circles; after my return\nto the study he draws as reproduction b, a leaf, as reproduction c, three\nstraight lines meeting in a point, and as reproduction d, a very obtuse\nangled triangle, the obtuse angle pointing upwards, with a straight line\nperpendicular to the base extending downwards from its middle point,\nso that the figure has a distant resemblance to an umbrella, and a still\nmore remote one to an anchor. We spoke during this experiment.\nI regard it as in its course not convincing, and in its result a complete\nfailure. For this reason I considered it unnecessary to produce the\ndrawings ; all the more that they present nothing characteristic.\n23rd Experiment.\u2014October 23rd, 1890. 10.9 to 10.12. Agent, the\nwriter. Percipient, Fraulein A. (the same as in 17). Conditions\nin all details the same as in Experiment 17. Separate rooms. I say,\n\"It is an object which is to be drawn,\" and in the next room I draw a\nquart-pot (Literkrug). Question, \"Ready?\" Answer, \"Yes.\" I return\nto the study. The first reproduction represents a head, and on my\nsaying \" Wrong,\" a second reproduction representing a fish is drawn in\nmy presence, I standing behind chair 5. It was absolutely impossible\nfor the percipient to see the original. I now ask, \"What am I thinking\nof?\" Answer, \"An apple.\" \"Wrong.\" I repeat the question. Answer,\n\"A quart-pot.\" \"Right.\" The percipient says, \"I thought of that first,\nand did not believe it was right.\" Now, there certainly were quart-\npots standing on the table of the study, but I am sure that in asking\nthe question I did not look at them. The experiment must, neverthe\nless, be regarded as a failure. The conditions during the last part were\n.defective, and guesswork or unconscious suggestion may have produced\nthe result. I relate it, however, because it so often happens that the per\ncipients say when, it is too late, \" I thought of that first,\" and then.\n\fExperimental Studies in Thought-Transference. 15\nallow themselves to be led away by other images or sense impres\nsions ;\u2014-unless these supplementary explanations are the result of\nretro-active memory-illusions.\n21th Experiment.\u2014October 23rd, 1890. 10.19 to 10.22. Persons\nand conditions as in Experiment 17. Question (from the next room,\ndoor closed), \"Are you ready?\" Answer, \"I do not think of anything.\"\nI re-enter the study, and make the task easier for the percipient by\nsaying \" Letters,\" upon which she writes \" A, H,\" I standing behind\nthe chair. She then says, \"They are entwined,\" and makes reproduction\n216, then 21c, which approaches the original still more. This experi\nment is a half success, but with a probability of guessing right by\nchance alone of 1 in 24 ; and subject to the need of making due\nallowance for the natural association of ideas, since the percipient\nwould be likely to think first of the initial of her own name. As a\nfailure, this experiment is interesting and instructive ; regarded as a\nsuccess it would not prove thought-transference. (Cf. original 21 and\nreproductions 21, a, 6, c.)\n25th Experiment.\u2014November 1st, 1890. 4.30 to 4.35 p.m. Agent,\nthe writer. Percipient, Fraulein K., an easily hypnotisable patient\nof hysterical temperament. She sits in armchair 4, and the agent\nstands behind her. Original, a cup, which I drew in the next room.\nThe percipient makes several beginnings, and tries to draw an eye. This\nimage of an eye surged up in her mind at first and persisted. Three\nattempts at reproductions showing nothing characteristic, the attempt\nis given up. Complete failure.\n26th Experiment.\u2014November 1st, 1890. 4.48 to 4.51 p.m. Percipient,\nPraulein K., completely awake as in the previous experiment. Agent,\nthe author, draws original 22 on table e in the next room, with closed\ndoor. The percipient, sitting on chair 4 in the study, draws at the\nsame time reproduction 22a. On my return I look at her drawing,\nand say \" Wrong,\" and go on thinking intently of the original. She\nthen draws reproduction 226, I standing behind her chair and looking at\nher paper. I say, \" Wrong, try again.\" The percipient now draws a\ncircle. I say, \" Right, but not finished.\" She now draws reproduction\n22c, I keeping perfectly still, and giving her no further hint whatever.\nThis experiment is to a certain extent successful and even demonstra\ntive, though the plan laid down was not quite strictly adhered to.\nThe percipient might have guessed triangle, cross, and circle; but\nwhy does she attach to the circle a square placed so very unsym-\nmetrically, but so that when I look at that part only, ignoring the\ndiameter and the line which cuts the circle, the relation of the lower\nright-hand corner to the circle corresponds completely to the original ?\nIf mere association of ideas produced reproduction 22c, much more\n\f16 Baron von Schrenck-Notzing.\nnatural combinations of a circle and a square might have occurred to\nher. Thus, in spite of the less strict conditions, and the causes of error\nwhich we have taken into account, something remains which points to\nthought-transference when considered with the results of earlier experi\nments. Taken alone, this experiment would be unimportant, but it is\nsignificant in connection with the previous ones, (Cf. original and\nreproduction 22.)\nIII.\u2014Experiments in Guessing Objects, Persons, &c, Thought of.\nIt remains to add to these 26 experiments with drawings other\nexperiments in thought-transference of a different kind which were\ncarried out with the same percipients. My object in these experiments\nwas to study for myself the nature of communication of thoughts with\nout observable mediation of the senses ; in doing which I kept possible\nsources of error carefully in mind in each particular case. The follow\ning method recommends itself as both convenient and convincing. Let\nthe agent think of some object or person, and ask the subject, \" What\nam I thinking about]\" at the same time circumscribing the percipient's\ntask by words if desired. I made the following experiments in this\nmanner.\n1st Experiment.\u2014August 31st, 1890. 10.5 to 10.7 p.m. Agent, the\nwriter. Percipient, Fraulein A. We are sitting at the table and\ntalking. I say suddenly, \" I am thinking of a person we both know ;\nwho is it ? \"\n1st answer : \"HerrK.\" (Wrong.)\n2nd answer : \" Herr A.\" (Right.)\n2nd Experiment.\u2014August 31st, 1890. 10.8 p.m. Same conditions as\nin preceding experiment. The same question. I thought of a person\nwho lives in the same house as Fraulein A. She first mentions a person\nwho lives next door. The second answer was quite right. No hints were\ngiven. As we have probably about forty acquaintances in common,\nthe chances for a correct guess in Experiments 1 and 2 are 1 in 40.\nThat any latent excitation of the senses should have aroused the same\nthought in both brains twice running seems to me improbable. It is\na noteworthy circumstance that the percipient immediately followed\nme mentally to the neighbourhood where the person thought of is\nusually to be found. While I thought of the person, I had vividly\nbefore my eyes the image of the street in which that person lives.\nUnconscious suggestion is here excluded.\n3rd Experiment.\u2014August 31st, 1890. 10.10 p.m. Duration, a few\nseconds. All conditions and circumstances as in the previous experi\nment. \"I am thinking of an object in this room.\" Answer: \"Beer\ntankard.\" (Right.) I had purposely refrained from looking at the\n\fExperimental Studies in - Thought-Transference. 17\ntankards on the table, nor was my attention drawn to this idea uncon\nsciously, being the first presenting itself to me. On the contrary, I\nchose this out of several competing ideas because it was easy to picture\nto oneself. However, I do not object to this experiment being regarded\nas a case of pseudo-thought-transference.\n1th Experiment.\u2014August 31st, 1890. 10.13 p.m. Same circum\nstances as before. I should explain that my room is quite over\ncrowded with objects, pictures, pots, utensils, books, &c, so that\nI often do not know where to put a thing down. I now think of an\nIndian silk handkerchief, which, together with a pair of red Oriental\nslippers, is in a basket exactly behind me; 1\u00a3 yards away from it there\nis another Eastern handkerchief, hanging on a bookshelf. The two are\nalike in colour, pattern, and size. I am quite certain that in this\nchoice my gaze was not unconsciously attracted by this handkerchief.\nIn order to meet any objection as to association of ideas, or unconscious\nsuggestion, I purposely chose something behind my back. My question,\n\"What thing in this room am I thinking about?\" was answered at\nonce by the percipient. \"About the red Turkish slippers.\" I reply,\n\" Nearly.\" The second answer was, \" The Indian handkerchief.\"\n(Right.) No hint led her to this, though there are other things in the\nbasket. The first answer seems to me more important than the second.\nHow comes it that the percipient at once accompanies me mentally to\nthe place where the selected object was, just as in the 2nd experi\nment? The sources of error mentioned cannot explain it ; some\nunknown factor seems rather to be concerned.\nExperiments 5, 6, 7, in which, in spite of the percipient's fatigue, I\ntried to make her guess cards, failed completely. So did Experiment 8,\nin guessing an object.\nExperiment 9, in which Frau Eug.. tried to guess one of 10\nnumerals, also entirely failed.\n10th Experiment.\u2014October 15th, 1890. 8.30 p.m., with Eraulein A.r\nwho sat on chair 7. I sit on chair 8. A black fan is fastened, among\nother objects, to the wall of my study over the sofa. I think of it\nwithout looking at it. When choosing, I at first thought of taking\nFraulein A.'s hat as the object to be guessed. It lay upon a side table-\nQuestion, \" Of what thing in the room am I thinking?\" Answer, \"My\nhat.\" Wrong, but wrong in a noteworthy way, because at first I had really\nthought of choosing the hat. I may remark that, sitting on chair 8, I\nhad the fan in front of me, so that though unconscious suggestion by\nan unconscious glance would have been easy in this case, the guess was\nnevertheless wrong. I carried this experiment no further. At\n10 o'clock I was sitting by chance on chair No. 4, so that the fan was\nbehind me. The experiment occurs to me again and I ask, \" What did\nc\n\f18 Baron von Schrenck-Notzing.\nI think of?\" Answer, \"Fan.\" (Right.) The interesting 17th experi\nment of the diagram series now followed. On this evening with No.\n10 of the second series, and Nos. 17, 18, 19, 20 of the first series,\nthere was a quite inexplicable series of strikingly successful experi\nments, in spite of the greater strictness in the conditions. One is\ninclined to believe in a change in the receptivity of the percipients,\ndependent on some unknown factors ; as may be also concluded from\nthe experiments of Professors Richet and Sidgwick.\nllth Experiment.\u2014October 23rd, 1890. 8.50 to 8.53. Percipient,\nFraulein A. Agent, the writer. Percipient sits on chair 7, agent on\nchair 8. On the table marked b are a number of different objects : six\nbooks, two newspapers, a stethoscope, an induction coil, five electrodes,\nan ash-tray, gloves, a lamp, a hat, <fee. I think of one of the books,\nbound in red, which is on the table, and ask, \" What object in the\nroom am I thinking of?\" 1st answer, \"Hat\"; 2nd answer, \"Book\nwith red binding.\" Question, \" Which book ?\" The percipient points\nout a book which lies close to the one I had chosen, and which also has\na red binding. I do not believe that I drew Fraulein A.'s attention to\nthe table, or betrayed myself by involuntary indications ; but the\nobjection that there was some latent exciting cause for the brains of\nboth persons would have had some justification had the experiment\nsucceeded. I consider this experiment a failure, and that even had\nit succeeded it would not prove anything.\n12th Experiment.\u2014October 19th. 9.9 to 9.12. Same conditions\nand persons, &c, as in No. 11. On the cupboard in my study near\nthe entrance door there is a row of empty letter-paper boxes, with\nflowers and gilding outside. Again, without looking at the object, I\nask, \"What thing in the room ami thinking of?\" 1st answer, \" Of a\nboard painted with flowers.\" (The analogy is striking. There is such\na board hanging near the bow window in quite another part of the\nroom.) 2nd answer, \"Of the round table.\" 3rd answer, \"Of the\nblue box standing on it.\" This box is also gilded. The box and\nflowers agree ; the other points are wrong. I do not venture to decide\nwhether these 3 answers are the result of mere guessing. It is possible.\nIn any case I was careful to make no sign.\n13th Experiment.\u2014October 23rd. 10.35 to 10.40. Circumstances\nand conditions as in the last. Seven numbers of two digits, written\ndown by me with the necessary precautions, are to be guessed in\nsuccession.\nOriginals: 4, 23, 16, 55, 83, 30, 12.\nGuesses: 44, 68, 24, 50, 47, 18, 34.\nlith Experiment.\u2014October 23rd, 1890. 10.40 to 10.42. Same\nconditions.. Object thought of : the lamp shade. Four wrong answers.\n\fExperimental Studies in Thought-Transference. 19\n15th and l&th Experiments.\u2014November 9th. 8.50 p.m. The same\npersons and conditions as in the last experiments. A friend, E., is also\npresent. I think first of a cigarette. Three answers are made with\nout success. Then E. writes the word \" door handle \" in another part\nof the room. Three wrong answers.\n17th Experiment.\u2014November 1st, 1890, with my patient K., at\n5.30. Thought of\u201444 ; guessed\u20147 and 22.\nBesides these experiments I tried three, but without result, with\nanother person, who was hypnotised.\n18<\/& Experiment.\u2014Place, drawing-room of Frau K. Time, 7.19 to\n7.20 p.m. Percipient, the daughter of Frau K.,\u2014S., aged 17. Present,\nFrau K., two ladies, and myself. The daughter is in the next room. I\ntell the others that no one is to glance at the object touched and chosen\nby me, but each is to look at something else, thinking, however, of the\nthing I touch. I touch the sugar-tongs, lying on the sugar-basin,\namong 30 or 40 things on the table. No word is uttered. I call\nthe daughter in. In my opinion the conditions excluded the possibility\nof unconscious indications perceived by Fraulein K. While she was\nstill in the doorway she said, without stopping to think, \" Sugar-\ntongs.\" The success was very striking. I think this experiment con\nvincing, as I watched the persons present closely.\nThe 19th Experiment, under the same conditions, is a failure. The\nclock on the sideboard, the porcelain dial-plate was thought of, and\nthe answers were : (1) tray ; (2) sweetmeats; (3) water.\n20th Experiment, tried with the same lady in hypnosis. Trans\nference of a drawing. Complete failure.\n21st Experiment, under same conditions. Thought of, a top-hat ;\nnothing was guessed. Complete failure.\nConclusion.\nI have here reported all my experiments from January to Novem\nber, 1890 ; and with equal fulness on the positive and negative sides.\nForty-five experiments with percipients in a normal state are included,\none of which is made up of several (when 7 numbers were to be\nguessed). Altogether, therefore, 51 experiments, with 6 persons ; 26\nexperiments made with drawings, and 25 with guessing of persons,\nobjects, numbers, and cards.\nWith regard to the susceptibility of the persons experimented with,\ntheir ages range between 17 and 30 years ; one, whom I tried in\nhypnosis, is not susceptible ; with another only one experiment suc\nceeded, and that the first. The other five show more susceptibility,\none among them is of the male sex, Graf S., who is moderately suscep\ntible. Fraulein K., the last with whom the drawing experiments were\n\f20 Baron von Schrenck-Notzing.\nmade, appears to have the right temperament, but to be insufficiently\ndeveloped. There are three others. Frau Eug. draws wrongly at first,\u2014\nbut when the latent capacity is excited, the thought starts up with the\nsuddenness of lightning, and the figures are drawn with astonishing\ncorrectness and completeness. Fraulein A. and Friiulein E. show the\ngreatest susceptibility. Fraulein E. seems to get hold of the elements\nof the drawing, but is apt to reproduce them somewhat altered by\nimagination. Fraulein A.'s are certainly the best performances. She,\nas well as Graf S., displays the peculiarity of seizing the thought almost\nas it arises. She immediately follows me in thought to the place of\nthe object to be guessed. For example, in the 2nd experiment of the\n2nd series, what first occurs to me is the house and the street in which\nthe person I decide to think of lives, and she follows me there mentally\nat once. Or I think of selecting an object among those in a basket\nhanging in my room, and choose the handkerchief, though the red\nslippers first present themselves for mental picturing. Her first answer\nis \" red slippers.\" In two cases she followed me immediately, without\nany indication, to the table on which lay a number of objects, from\namong which I intended to select. She chose the hat I had thought\nof but given up, and the book lying near the selected one. When\nin the experiment with the fan, which in the first part of the experi\nment arose in my mind as a second idea, I allowed an interval of more\nthan an hour to elapse, and then took up the idea again, this time as a\nfirst idea, she guessed it at once. In the case of the seven numbers\nshe guesses only the first right, all the others wrong.\nThe same thing happens with the drawings. I draw two con\ncentric squares. She draws immediately a single square, and wishes\nto stop. If I make her go on she gets wrong. She guesses the serpent\nright at once, in spite of the closed door; and of original 18 she\ndivines what I first thought of, a triangle with a perpendicular. I\nadded to the drawing only to make the task more complicated. \"What\nis added as the result of reflective mental labour is less easily recognised\nby many percipients than the idea almost in the act of surging up from\nthe unconscious,\u2014the ]wocess offormation.\nFirst experiments, as in the case of Fraulein K. (Experiment 18, 2nd\nseries), generally succeed the best, because the process of reflection\nprevents, or at least acts as a check to success. The more, therefore,\nthe character of exact scientific investigation is made prominent in\nexperiments of this kind, the smaller become the chances of success.\nThus it is advisable to experiment often, and little at a time. Now\nand then this strange power comes over persons of suitable temperament\nlike a flash ; but such moments are impossible to foresee. This power\nappeared in Frau Eug. like lightning, and with Fraulein A. on one\nevening (October 15th) it was so intense that experiments under\n\fExperimental Studies in Thought-Transference. 21\nstricter conditions, at a distance, succeeded better than simpler ones\non other occasions.\nOn the whole, I have convinced myself that persons who are very\nsuggestible, in whom imagination is active, and particularly those of\nslightly hysterical temperament, are more suitable as percipients than\nothers. The power does not appear to be so rare as is believed ; the\ndifficulty lies rather in seizing the moment when such persons are\nin the right mood. The psychical process is comparable to artistic\nactivity. Under the dissecting knife of scientific analysis no artistic\ncreation would be possible : it needs the undisturbed quiet of the\nstudio.\nThe repetition of similar ideas both in percipient and agent in the\nseries here given is also worthy of remark. For example, Fraulein A.\noften thought first of some object near her, or of such as had already\nbeen guessed. In reproduction 18 the lines of the serpent are still to\nbe seen. \"Hat\" and \"Quart-pot\" are repeated as first guesses, because\nthese objects had been chosen once. A critical survey of the objects\nchosen by the agent is equally important. For example, repetition,\ncertainly unconscious and first observed in putting the experiments\ntogether, occurs as follows:\u2014\nOriginals 1, 6, and 11\u2014three crosses.\nOriginals 2, 22\u2014two circles (thought of by me).\nOriginal 5\u2014circles (thought of by Baron v. W.).\nOriginals 3, 13, 18\u2014three triangles. (In originals 13 and 18 in\ndifferent combinations, with circles.)\nOriginals 7, 10, 14, 22\u2014 four squares (concentric squares, a figure\nmade of 5 squares, and a square with a circle).\nOriginal 20 and that of Experiment 23\u2014two mugs, and one cup\n(Experiment 25).\nOriginals 8 and 12 both represent the figure 3.\nAs the percipients were different in different cases, this recurrence\naffects the value of the experiments very little. For the same idea\ncannot be shown to have recurred in a series of experiments with any\none person. And in first trials one prefers to choose simple figures.\nBesides which, the manner of the reproduction is often decisive. If,\nfor example, two circles are placed one on the other as in reproduction\n86, it is certain that the percipient was not thinking of a 3, but that\na figure, without definite meaning, was impressed upon her. Moreover,\nthe reproduction of peculiarities of combination and the correct grasp\ning of little accessories are very convincing. For instance, in connection\nwith Original 9, a W was seen, though I was thinking intently of a star;\nwith Original 12, a B was seen, instead of the number 3; with Original 4,\na cup, instead of the figure 1. Drawing 15 was seen as something like a\ntower or pedestal; in 14 the peculiar arrangement of the five squares; in\n\f22 Baron von Schrenck-Notzing.\nreproduction 22c the relation of the circle with regard to part of the\nsquare. Finally, even with agent and percipient separated, a quite\nunlikely figure is correctly drawn at the right moment, that of the\nserpent. These obvious and important results do not fit in with the\nusual explanations ; and chance alone will not produce so large a\nnumber of striking successes.\nAfter full allowance for possible sources of error, there remains in\nthe way in which the results were obtained, and in the amount of\ncoincidence, something inexplicable which calls for further investigation,\nand seems to indicate with some certainty the operation of a factor not\nyet perceptible to our senses.\nThe plates which follow represent (1) the ground plan of the rooms\nin which the experiments took place and (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,) drawings\nand reproductions made in the experiments. These are tracedfrom, and\nare, facsimiles of, the actual drawings of agent and percipients. It will\nbe noticed that the drawings are numbered consecutively, but that as the\ndrawings corresponding to every experiment are not given, the number\ning of the drawings does not correspond throughout with the number\ning of the experiments. The drawings are, however, always referred to\nby their own numbers.\n\f\/\nI\no\nN\n1\n1\n1\n2- *\u2014, fa c**.\n'2a\"\"\n0\n%<4\ne\n0\ni\ni <?> \u00a9 $\n6\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\fExperiments in Automatic Writing. 23\nII.\nSOME RECENT EXPERIMENTS IN AUTOMATIC WRITING.\nBy Thomas Barkworth. .\nIt is well to state, at the outset of this paper, that it will not be\nfound to contain anything new or startling. Nor does it seem to me\nthat these characteristics are necessary to its usefulness. For though\nsuch features have a value of their own in stimulating inquiry, and\nin forming matter for assimilation by future investigators who shall\nhave ascertained the principles or laws which, in our present state of\nknowledge, we are only groping after, they at present rather confound\nthan assist our reason. On the other hand, the more we gain in\nexperimental acquaintance with the psychical side of existence in the\nliving subject, the more likely of fruition, because the more easy of\nclassification, will be those rare and sporadic phenomena which may be\ngleaned from the world of phantasm and of second sight.\nWhile, therefore, facts of all kinds are valuable to us, the most\nhopeful method of psychical research appears to me to proceed from the\nknown to the unknown, and from the simple to the complex, and thus,\nby studying the grammar of research, to find gradually the meaning of\nfact after fact which at present convey no more significance to us than\nso many undeciphered hieroglyphics.\nTo no person are we more indebted for showing us this path to the\nknowledge which we seek than to Edmund Gurney, whose experiments\nin hypnotism have thrown a new light upon the constitution of human\npersonality in the living man, and my desire, in the kind of experiments\nI am about to record, is to follow humbly in his footsteps.\nIn comparing hypnotic experiment with automatic writing, we find\nboth advantage and disadvantage. The advantages of hypnotism are\nthe opportunities for studying physiological as well as psychical\nphenomena, the absolute control which it gives us over the subject,\nunchecked by his self-consciousness, fear of ridicule, and the like, and\nthe greater security from conscious deception or prejudiced ideas which\nit assures us of as long as hypnosis lasts. On the other hand, granting\nthe good faith of the automatic writer, we can obtain nearly as full\nresults on the psychical side, without risk, or the imputation of risk, to\nthe moral or physical well-being of the operator, and can pursue the\ninquiry at any spare moment and with no further appliances than a\npencil and a sheet of paper.\n\f24 Thomas Sarkworih.\nOne thing, however, is essential, and that is an unprejudiced mind.\nIn automatic writing we are confronted at once with a mysterious\nintelligent agency, operating without the conscious will or mental\nparticipation of the writer, but subject, as I am inclined to think, to\nsuggestion in the highest degree. Let it be impressed upon the mind\nof the writer that this seemingly extraneous intelligence is extra-\nmundane also, and it will respond to his ideas with the utmost fidelity.\nLet him believe that he is holding intercourse with Satan, and it will\nhasten to assure him of the fact, and to back up the assertion with\nprofane language ; or let him believe himself in communication with\nsome other spirit, celestial or terrestrial, and to the utmost of his own\nknowledge, possessed or forgotten, will he be humoured to the top of his\nbent. In all this we see just what might be expected from our\nknowledge, already acquired, of the workings of the passive conscious\nness. Like clay in the hands of the potter1 the passive consciousness\nof the hypnotised subject accepts the part assigned him, and he is\nequally ready to believe himself a brooding hen or a water pump, and\nto spread his arms for wings or work them up and down for handles.\nIn relating the few facts which I am about to describe, my principal\nobject is, however, not to sustain or assail any theories, but to stimulate\ninquiry. My hope is that many persons may be induced to make\nexperiments who at present hold aloof from fear of meddling with what\nis forbidden, or uncanny, or too serious for what they would deem\ntrifling. In the Journal for July I appealed for assistance in these\nexperiments, and from all those whom it reaches I only got replies\nfrom two gentlemen, neither of whom, unfortunately, could use the\nplanchette. Is there no one, then, among our 700 members and\nassociates who has the gift, and can spare fifteen minutes now and then\nto make experiments and record results 1\nThe operator in the following experiments is a young lady, aged\nfifteen, an inmate of my household, and companion in study with my\nown daughter. We have, therefore, the best means of estimating her\ncharacter and her bonafides, which, let me say at once, are, we consider,\nbeyond a doubt. She had not previously heard of Planchette, and\nSpiritualism was, to her, a mere name. I took care from the first that\nno ideas of this kind should be instilled, and she thus approached the\nsubject without any foregone conclusion. Most of the experiments\nwere made with the aid of the planchette. But latterly a pencil was\n1 This simile is appropriate in the above particular connection, but it would be\nfar otherwise in a general description of the passive personality. The latter, in my\nview, is passive more in the sense in which alocomotive is passively under the control\nof the driver. But, like the locomotive, it would also be considered liable to\nexplosions, as of emotion, desperation, &c, and to misapplied, irregular, or insuffi\ncient operation, as during insanity or intoxication.\n\fExperiments in Automatic Writing. 25\nused, held vertically between the points of the fingers and thumbs of\nboth hands, and once or twice the pencil was held in the ordinary way.\nThese changes, however, did not seem to affect the result. The first\nexperiments were attempted by this girl, whom I will call C, in con\njunction with her companion, but it soon became evident that the latter\nwas merely a passenger, so to speak, and that C. was the real operator.\nShe was therefore left to write by herself. Unfortunately, she looked\nupon the whole thing as a great bore, and, as I was unwilling to press\nher, the experiments have only been few and far between. She never\nknew what she had written till it was looked at, and there was often\nsome slight difficulty in deciphering it.\nThus the first question, Who are you that write ? produced what at\nfirst I took to be mere scrawling, and C. shortly after left the room.\nAfter she had done so I took another look at this scrawl, and then at\nonce perceived that it was legible, and that the name written in answer\nto the question was \" Henry Morton.\" I at once followed C. upstairs,\nand asked her if she had ever heard the name, and she replied that it\nwas that of a character in a Christmas play she had acted in, more than\na year previously. Had the name, as it easily might have, been that\nof some deceased friend, it is obvious what inference would have been\ndrawn. I give the next three questions just in the order they followed\non the next evening\n2. Why do you write 1\u2014A. Because I must.\n3. What compels you to write 1\u2014A. I do not know.\n4. Henry Morton, do you know you are part of me ?\u2014A. Yes,\nI know.\nThe last question, being asked in a tone of conviction, amounted to\na suggestion, and was adopted accordingly. This docility was illus\ntrated in other ways. For instance, the planchette, having taken to\nrunning straight off the paper after completing an answer, was told not\nto do so again, and at once complied. I should here say that all the\nquestions and instructions to the planchette were first dictated by me\nand then repeated aloud by the operator.\nSome spelling tests followed. C. is not good at spelling, and feels\ngreat uncertainty with difficult words. Her voluntary spelling of such\nis very hesitating, and does not therefore give any suggestion to the\npassive consciousness. The two personalities acted, therefore, inde\npendently of one another, with some curious results. I will give one\ninstance.\n7. Spell psychical.\u2014-A voluntary attempt was first made. Result :\nSicickle. C. was not told whether this was right or wrong, but was\ntold to try Planchette. Result : Cicicle.\nSome questions in mental arithmetic were put, the planchette\n\f26 Thomas Barkworih.\nbeing instructed to write the answers only, without any calculation.\nI am informed by her governess that C. has but little arithmetical\ncapability, and is backward for her age in this subject. Bearing this\nin mind, I think the results were noteworthy. Directly the question\nwas put the instrument began to write the answer.\n28. Divide 264 by 16. First of all an attempt was made to work\nthe sum voluntarily, and, with some delay, the answer given was \"17\nodd,\" which was wrong, but on Planchette being appealed to it at once\nwrote 16 and 8 over, which was correct. As we had many instances\nof the passive intelligence thus excelling the primary activities of the\nmind, I may take this opportunity of saying that it is quite in accord\nance with what I had expected, and have elsewhere spoken of, but\nwhether this superiority is essential or accidental, whether, that is, it be\ndue to greater power or to greater concentration, cannot at present be\ndetermined, at all events evidentially.\n12. Divide 187,981 by 13. Answer, 14,463.\nThis is wrong by three only, and considering the normal powers of\nthe operator above-mentioned, I think it a somewhat remarkable\nanswer.\nI now come to a class of questions designed to test the memory of\nthe passive consciousness.\nWhat happened on the 1st June?\nThis question was asked in the last week of July. I chose the date\nat hazard, and neither C. nor I had any recollection of it. But\nPlanchette answered \" Went to church,\" and we then got an almanack\nand found that the 1st June was a Sunday. This kind of question was\noften tried with inconclusive results, but never with incorrect ones,\nexcept on one occasion. Being asked in October what happened on\n13th July, the answer was \"Monday lessons.\"1 If Planchette\nthought the day was Monday, it is rather curious that it should not\nhave said simply \" lessons.\" In reality, however, the day was a\nSunday, and it would be not impossible that C. had during that Sun\nday been worrying herself about the following day's work.\n14. Who conquered Peru 1\nThe answer to this was written \" Spires,\" and such an answer being\nunintelligible, Planchette was made to repeat it, with the same result.\nIt then occurred to C.'s governess to fetch the volume of Collier's History\n1 The manner in which the word \"lessons \" was written was a curiosity. After\nwriting Monday the tail of the y was brought back with elaborate flourishes, and the\nfirst s in \"lessons \" was written ; then the e and the l were written backwards ; then\nthe pencil was carried forward with more flourishes and gyrations to the second s,\nfollowed by the other letters in their order. So florid was all this scroll work that it\ntook much care to find afterwards what route the pencil had taken, though the word\nwas entirely legible.\n\fExperiments in Automatic Writing. 27\n,which C. had been reading three months previously. At the head of\none of the chapters was a table of dates which she had (at the time)\nlearnt by heart, among which were the following consecutively :\u2014\nReformers called Protestants at\nSpires 1529\nLeague of Smalcald 1530\nPizarro conquers Peru 1533\nThe name of Pizarro, which C. had forgotten, is placed in print\nexactly below the word Spires, and in this way the two words fell\ntogether under C's eye, and became indelibly associated in what I have\nelsewhere ventured to call the pictorial memory of the passive con\nsciousness. The next experiments I shall describe exhibit memory in\nanother aspect.\n11. Tell me something I don't know.\u2014A. You have a shot in\nyour eye.\nOn examination, I found a small blood speck on the margin of the\niris of one eye. This C. assured me she had no idea existed. It is\nprobable, however, that she had at some time seen it in her looking-\nglass when her mind was occupied with other matters.\n17. Tell me something more.\u2014No answer but scrawling.\n18. You must write (peremptorily).\u2014A. Frank Headley ill. (I\nhave altered the name.)\nIn answer to inquiries, C. said this was the name of a boy she had\nmet at the seaside two years before, but she knew no more about him,\nnot even where he lived. Accordingly the next question was,\n19. What is Frank Headley's address ?\u2014A. Lord Mayor's-walk.\nC, who lived near York, thought there was a street of this name\nthere, but was not sure. It was not till she went home for the\nholidays that she ascertained, through mutual friends, that Frank\nHeadley went to school in Lord Mayor's-walk, so that Planchette was\nfound to have answered correctly. The explanation suggested is, that\nwhen he met her two years previously, he had mentioned this and she\nhad forgotten it. Planchette, however, was unable to give the number\nin Lord Mayor's-walk, which perhaps he had never told her, and when\nasked what he was ill with, replied \" Cold in head.\"\nSome experiments were made with the right and left hands con\nsecutively, thus\u2014\n27. Give the name of one of the principal Elizabethan statesmen.\nBight hand Answer.\u2014Walpole.\nLeft hand Answer.\u2014Walsingham.\nThe last group of questions asked referred to subjects which it was\ncertain C. did not know and never had known. For instance, \"What is\nthe price of Egyptian Unified ? \" \" What is the second Christian name\n\f28 Thomas Barkworth.\nof So-and-so ? \" &c. Invariably these questions produced no reply ; the\ninstrument only made scrawls. It may be quite possible, however,\nthat had an answer been insisted on, one would have been written (as\nin the case of Frank Headley's alleged cold in the head), and neces\nsarily an incorrect one, because of the writer's ignorance of the facts,\ncombined with the effects of suggestion compelling an answer of some\nkind. This I am inclined to think may be the explanation of Mrs.\nNewnham's answers under her husband's cross-examination1\u2014answers\nwhich he says were foreign to the conscious intelligence of either\nof them, and which contained an attempt at deliberate invention\nrather than plead guilty to total ignorance.'1 If, under suggestion, a\nhypnotic subject were told to jump over a house, he would not be able\nto do it, but he would jump as high as he could.\nAmong miscellaneous questions one only is worth recording. It\nwas, \" Are you the spirit of my grandmother 1 \" This was the only\ntime the idea of spirits was introduced, and as it was obviously put\njestingly, it did not convey any real suggestion of their agency.\nThe answer accordingly was, \"No, I was in \" ; and here\nfollowed a remarkably well-executed outline map of Africa, such as\nfew persons, and certainly not C, could have drawn from memory ;\nevery important bay and promontory being\u2014as we found on com\nparison with the atlas\u2014correctly shown, and in due proportion. At\none point only was it in error.\nThe explanation was not that C. was guided by some defunct\ngeographer or Africander, but that she had been getting up the\ngeography of Africa that morning with the aid of the map ; and thus\nhad the pictorial memory of the passive personality, unconsciously to\nherself, recorded and reproduced this complicated observation, which\nshe had made without effort, and which was merely incidental to her\ntask.\n1 [For accounts of Mr. and Mrs. Newnham's experiments, in which she wrote with\nplanchette and without conscious knowledge of what she wrote, appropriate answers\nto questions written down by him at a different table and unknown to her, see\nProceedings, Vol. III., pp. 7-23, and Phantasms of the Liting, Vol. I., pp. 63-71.\n-Ed.]\n- These were all answers to questions not spoken aloud, but written down by Mr.\nNewnham and not seen by Mrs. Newnham. It is a curious fact that while the\nquestions which were written down by Mr. Newnham were invariably apprehended by\nMrs. Newnham, the amioers, which were in some cases known to him and not to her\n(e.g., Masonic secrets), were either not apprehended at all, or only in a very imperfect\ndegree. Can it be that for effective thought-transference it is helpful to give precision\nand definiteness to the thought, by writing it down, or else speaking it aloud ? (This\nlast in another room, of course.) That the force of all suggestion must greatly depend\nupon clear definition or expression is natural to expect, and there are many thoughts\nwhich float through our minds and are grasped effectively by ourselves without\nverbal formulas, but which, nevertheless, may require embodying in the latter to make\nthem transferable to other minds.\n\fExperiments in Automatic Writing. 29\nSuch are the few and slight experiments which I have ventured to\nlay before the society. I have done so mainly for two reasons ; firstly,\nthe hope that sufficient interest may be aroused in those who hear of\nthem to induce other and more important essays in this interesting\nmethod of investigation ; and secondly, to indicate the lines on which\nit may, as I think, be most profitably pursued.\nIt will be seen that, in one respect, these experiments bear in much\nthe same direction, and towards the same conclusions, as Miss X.'s\ninteresting paper on crystal-gazing. It would seem that nothing is\never really forgotten, though the bygone memories evoked by pencil, or\ncrystal, may appear so new and strange that we fail to recognise them\nas ever having been included in our experience.\n\f30 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nIII.\nON THE EVIDENCE FOR CLAIRVOYANCE.\nBy Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nPART I.\nBefore beginning to examine the evidence for clairvoyance some\npreliminary discussion as to what it is that we have to investigate\nseems to be required. The word clairvoyance is often used very loosely\nand with widely different meanings. In the present paper I intend to\ndenote by it a faculty of acquiring supernormally, but not by reading\nthe minds of persons present, a knowledge of facts such as we normally\nacquire by the use of our senses. I do not limit it, notwithstanding\nthe derivation of the word, to knowledge which would normally be\nacquired by the sense of sight, nor do I limit it to a knowledge of\npresent facts. A similar knowledge of past and, if necessary, of\nfuture facts may be included.\nOn the other hand, I exclude the mere faculty of seeing apparitions\nor visions, which is sometimes called clairvoyance. Clairvoyant\nknowledge may reach the consciousness of the percipient in the form\nof a vision, but no vision will here be termed clairvoyant unless it be\nat least veridical ; which, it is needless to say, many\u2014probably most\u2014\nvisions and apparitions are not.\nAgain, the word will not be used to mean supernormal knowledge\nof a simple fact such as we are accustomed to think of as the result of\ntelepathy. A dies, let us say, and at the same time his friend B at a\ndistance has an impression about A, or sees an apparition of A, or\nperhaps even knows that A is dying. If the knowledge goes no further\nthan this I shall regard it as a case of simple telepathy, as distinct\nfrom clairvoyance. But it sometimes happens that B seems to see the\nscene of A's death as it actually occurred, with details which we can\nhardly suppose to have originated in the mind of B by accident, or to\nbe due to previous knowledge or association, and which are unlikely to\nhave been consciously in the mind of A. Such a case as this may be\nconveniently discussed under the head of clairvoyance, even though we\nmay think telepathy a sufficient explanation of the facts, because, as\nwill be seen in the sequel, there are very similar cases where the\ntelepathic hypothesis is difficult to apply.\nOne class of cases\u2014often called clairvoyant by old writers we\nshall exclude, namely, those in which the knowledge exhibited by the\npercipient is already in the mind of some person present. Experiment\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 31\nhas proved that percipients will seem to themselves to see independently\nscenes which have no existence except in the mind of a person present,\nso that the impression if supernormal at all must be due to thought-\ntransference. A good instance of this is given in Phantasms of the\nLiving (Vol. I., p. 96), where Mrs. W., hypnotised by Mr. G. A. Smith,\nand describing, apparently clairvoyantly, a room unknown to her, but\nknown to Mr. Smith, descried on the table an open umbrella which\nhad no existence except in Mr. Smith's imagination. Cases like this\nshow that though, if a faculty of independent clairvoyance exists, it\nmay doubtless be exercised in the presence of persons cognisant of the\nfacts clairvoyantly known, it can hardly under these circumstances\nprove its existence. But though the evidential reason for dividing off\nthese cases from clairvoyance proper is clear, I am not prepared to say\nthat the line so drawn has much scientific value. It is undeniable that\nsuch evidence as we have of clairvoyant perception of things at a dis\ntance is often very much mixed up with evidence of similar perceptions\npossibly due to thought-transference from persons present, and this\nsuggests the possibility that clairvoyant perception of distant scenes is\nfacilitated when it can be led up to by thought-transference from those\npresent.\nThe fact is, we know too little about our subject to be able at\npresent to define it scientifically, and it is very doubtful whether, by\nany definition that could be framed, we could mark off a class of\nphenomena having any common explanation peculiar to themselves.\nAll we can do now is, as it were, to define provisionally a certain\nregion to explore, in the hope that the definition may aid us in ascer\ntaining what facts we have to explain, in tracing connections with\nalready known facts, such as telepathy and hyperaesthesia, and in\ndiscovering how far the evidence requires us to extend our concep\ntions of the possibility of acquiring supernormal knowledge, and of\nthe modes in which such supernormal knowledge may be obtained.\nThe subject as we have defined it naturally divides itself into two\nmain parts\u2014clairvoyant knowledge of facts which are known to\nsomebody somewhere, such as what A B is doing at a distance ; and\nclairvoyant knowledge of facts unknown to anyone in the world, such\nas a number drawn at random from a bag and not looked at. In the\npresent paper I propose to deal with the first kind of clairvoyance\nonly.\nBefore proceeding to the evidence, it will be well to consider\nbriefly the sources of error to be guarded against, and the possible\nexplanations of the phenomena. There is, of course, the usual\npossibility of absence of bona fides. The probability or improbability\nof this in each particular case my readers must estimate for them\nselves, but in the present paper I shall not bring forward any cases\n\f32 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nwhere such an explanation, seems at all probable to myself. Further,\nthere is the usual allowance to be made for inaccuracy and for defects\nof memory, many of the records not having been made at the time.\nThese possibilities have been fully discussed in Phantasms of the\nLiving, and need not be dwelt on further here. In a subsequent\npaper allowance will have also to be made for possible mal-observation,\nand it will have to be considered whether knowledge supposed to be\ninaccessible to the clairvoyant by ordinary means really was so; and\nextended sense perception (hyperaesthesia) and latent memory are further\nexplanations that will be chiefly applicable in this later discussion. The\npossible explanations which are of most importance in the present paper\nare chance coincidence, shrewd guessing, and finally telepathy; the last\nof which must be kept in view throughout, for, as we are dealing with\na percipience of facts known to some distant person, the question may\nalways be raised whether his knowledge had anything to do with the\npercipience. With this hypothesis in view, I shall try as far as I con\nveniently can to arrange the cases I have to bring forward according\nto the degree of difficulty in applying it, taking into account the con\nnection, if any, between this distant person\u2014whom we may provision\nally call the agent\u2014and the percipient, the extent to which the agent\nhad his mind directed towards the percipient, and the question whether\nany crisis was at the moment occurring in the agent's life.\nI shall begin with cases closely parallel to many which have been\nincluded in Phantasms of the Living as cases of telepathic clairvoyance,\nand in which telepathy is primd facie the simplest explanation. In\nthese cases the agent is clearly designated, and also his connection with\nthe percipient ; and the experience of the supposed agent at the moment\nis generally of a marked and exceptional character. Moreover, in most\nof these cases the initiative, or at least the psychical disturbance or\nimpulse which leads to the vision, is, so far as we can see, entirely on\nthe side of the agent, the percipient being in an apparently normal\nstate and not expecting or seeking any vision.\nThe first case I shall give comes to us through the American\nBranch of the Society. Mr. A. B. Wood writes to Mr. R A. Nims,\nan Associate of the American Branch, as follows:\u2014\n\"Muskegon, April 29th, 1890.\n(L. 868.) \"Incompliance with your suggestion, supplemented by the\nrequest of Mr. Richard Hodgson, I sought an interview with Mrs. Agnes\nPaquet, and obtained the following information regarding her strange experi\nence on the day of her brother's death. I submit the papers to you feeling\nthat they should go forward with the fullest and clearest information obtain\nable, and believing that you may suggest other questions the answers to\nwhich may have important bearing on the case.\n\" A. B. Wood.\"\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 33\nStatement of Accident.\n\" On October 24th, 1889, Edmund Dunn, brother of Mrs. Agnes Paquet,\nwas serving as fireman on the tug Wolf, a small steamer engaged in towing\nvessels in Chicago Harbour. At about 3 o'clock a.m., the tug fastened to a\nvessel, inside the piers, to tow her up the river. While adjusting the tow-\nline Mr. Dunn fell or was thrown overboard by the tow-line, and drowned.\nThe body, though sought for, was not found until about three weeks after\nthe accident, when it came to the surface near the place where Mr. Dunn\ndisappeared.\"\nMrs. Paquet's Statement.\n\" I arose about the usual hour on the morning of the accident, probably\nabout six o'clock. I had slept well throughout the night, had no dreams or\nsudden awakenings. I awoke feeling gloomy and depressed, which feeling I\ncould not shake\" off. After breakfast my husband went to his work, and, at\nthe proper time, the children were gotten ready and sent to school, leaving\nme alone in the house. Soon after this I decided to steep and drink some\ntea, hoping it would relieve me of the gloomy feelings aforementioned. I\nwent into the pantry, took down the tea canister, and as I turned around\nmy brother Edmund\u2014or his exact image\u2014stood before me and only a few\nfeet away. The apparition stood with back toward me, or, rather, partially\nso, and was in the act of falling forward\u2014away from me\u2014seemingly impelled\nby two ropes or a loop of ropa drawing against his legs. The vision lasted\nbut a moment, disappearing over a low railing or bulwark, but was very\ndistinct. I dropped the tea, clasped my hands to my face, and exclaimed,\n'My God! Ed. is drowned.'\n''At about half-past ten a.m. my husband received a telegram from Chicago,\nannouncing the drowning of my brother. When he arrived home he said to\nme, 'Ed. is sick in hospital at Chicago; I have just received a telegram,*\nto which I replied, ' Ed. is drowned ; I saw him go overboard.' I then gave\nhim a minute description of what I had seen. I stated that my brother, as\nI saw him, was bareheaded, had on a heavy, blue sailor's shirt, no coat, and\nthat he went over the rail or bulwark. I noticed that his pants' legs were rolled\nup enough to show the white lining inside. I also described the appearance\nof the boat at the point where my brother went overboard.\n\"I am not nervous, and neither before nor since have I had any experi\nence in the least degree similar to that above related.\n\"My brother was not subject to fainting or vertigo.\n\" Agnes Paquet.\"\nMr. Paqnet's Statement.\n\" At about 10.30 o'clock a.m., October 24th, 1889, I received a telegram\nfrom Chicago, announcing the drowning of my brother-in-law, Edmund\nDunn, at 3 o'clock that morning. I went directly home, and, wishing to break\nthe force of the sad news I had to convey to my wife, I said to her : ' Ed. is\nsick in hospital at Chicago ; I have just received a telegram.' To which she\nreplied : ' Ed. is drowned ; I saw him go overboard.' She then described to\nme the appearance and dress of her brother as described in her statement ;\nalso the appearance of the boat, &c.\n\"I started at once for Chicago, and when I arrived there I found the\nD\n\f34 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nappearance of that part of the vessel described by my wife to be exactly as\nshe had described it, though she had never seen the vessel ; and the crew\nverified my wife's description of her brother's dress, &c, except that they\nthought that he had his hat on at the time of the accident. They said that\nMr. Dunn had purchased a pair of pants a few days before the accident\noccurred, and as they were a trifle long before, wrinkling at the knees, he had\nworn them rolled up, showing the white lining as seen by my wife.\n'' The captain of the tug, who was at the wheel at the time of the accident,\nseemed reticent. He thought my brother-in-law was taken with a fainting fit\nor vertigo and fell over backward ; but a sailor (Frank Yemont) told a friend\nof mine that he (Yemont) stood on the bow of the vessel that was being\ntowed and saw the accident. He stated that my brother-in-law was caught\nby the tow-line and thrown overboard, as described by my wife. I think that\nthe captain, in his statement, wished to avoid responsibility, as he had no\nright to order a fireman\u2014my brother-in-law's occupation\u2014to handle the\ntow-line.\n\" My brother-in-law was never, to my knowledge, subject to fainting or\nvertigo.\n\" Peter Paquet.\"\nMr. Wood writes again on August 12th, 1890 :\u2014\n\" In accordance with request, I have had statements made in first\nperson.\n' ' I have made diligent inquiry, but cannot place the sailor Yemont. A\nletter sent to his last known, or supposed, address has been returned, marked\n' Not called for. ' . . .\n\"A. B. Wood.\"\nHere Mrs. Paquet not only had a vivid impression of her brother\nwithin a few hours of his death\u2014not only knew that he was dead\u2014\nbut saw a more or less accurate representation of the scene of his\ndeath.\nIt will have been noticed that her impression was not contempo\nraneous with the event to which it related, but occurred some six hours\nafterwards. It was preceded by a feeling of depression with which\nshe had awoken in the morning, and one is at first tempted to suppose\nthat she had dreamed of the event and forgotten it, and that her sub\nsequent vision was the result of a sudden revivification of the dream\nin her memory. But we do not know enough to justify us in assuming\nthis, and against such a hypothesis may be urged the experience of\nMrs. Storie related in Phantasms of the Living (Vol. I., p. 370,\nNo. 134), which somewhat resembles Mrs. Paquet's. Mrs. Storie tells\nus that all the evening she felt unusually nervous, and then, when\nshe went to bed, she had a remarkable dream, in which she saw a\nseries of scenes which afterwards turned out to have a clear relation\nto the death of her brother, who had been killed by a passing\ntrain four hours earlier. In her case the nervousness cannot be\nregarded as telepathic, as it is stated to have begun before the accident,\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance.\nbut it seems quite possible that the nervousness and depression may\nhave had to do with some condition in the percipient which rendered\nthe vision possible.\nAnother case remarkably like Mrs. Paquet's and exhibiting the\nsame characteristics of depression and deferment is No. 65 in Phantasms\nof the Living (Vol. I., p. 268). Compare also Cases 144 and 135 in the\nsame volume. Mr. (xurney regarded deferment as a strong point\nin favour of a telepathic explanation of such occurrences (same\nvol., p. 373).\nThe next, though the accident was fortunately of a less serious\nnature, is a very striking case, and the fact that the percipient\nrecorded her vision almost at once, and before she knew it to be\nveridical, gives it a very high evidential value. It was sent to us by\nDr. Elliott Coues, of Washington, a week after its occurrence. Dr.\nCoues writes :\u2014\n\"1726, N-street, N.W., Washington, D.C., U.S.A., January 21st, 1889.\n(L. 829.) \"Among many cases which are within my knowledge, of the\npossession and exercise of certain psychic faculties on the part of persons\ncommonly called clairvoyant, I select one which I think will interest your\nSociety, not on account of its mystery or novelty, but of its extreme\nsimplicity and thorough authentication. The incident itself is of the most\ntrivial character, followed by no consequences whatever to the person to\nwhom the little accident occurred, and I can see no reason why it should\nhave stimulated a clairvoyant's faculties into activity, more than any one of a\nthousand little occurrences of any day ; unless it may be (as is indeed\nprobable) that some specially strong magnetic rapport existed between the\nunconscious \"agent\" on the one hand and the surprised \"percipient \" on the\nother. Both parties to this unexpected and unintended experiment in\npsychic science are well known to me. Mrs. E. A. Conner, who kindly, at\nmy request, allows the use of her name, is widely known in this country as a\nwriter and speaker of no ordinary ability. The other lady desires to remain\nunknown by name, but I can attest her rare psychical faculties and absolute\nintegrity, after an intimate acquaintance of several years' duration.\n\"The case is simply this : In Washington, D.C., January 14th, 1889,\nbetween 2 and 3 p.m., Mrs. Conner is going up the steps of her residence,\nNo. 217, Delaware-avenue, carrying some papers. She stumbles, falls, is\nnot hurt, picks herself up, and enters the house.\n'' At or about the same time\u2014certainly within the hour, probably within\n30 minutes, perhaps at the very moment - -another lady, whom I will call\nMrs. B., is sitting sewing in her room, about lh miles distant. The two\nladies are friends, though not of very long standing. They had walked\ntogether the day before (Sunday, January 13th), but had not met this day\n(the 14th). Mrs. B. \" sees \" the little accident in every detail. The vision\nor image is minutely accurate (as it afterwards proves). Nevertheless, it is\nso wholly unexpected and unaccountable, that she doubts it were not a pass\ning figment of her imagination. But the mental impression is so strong;\nD 2\n\f3G Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nthat she keeps thinking it over, and sits down and writes a letter to Mrs.\nConner, which I enclose. The letter is written, of course, without any\ncommunication whatever between the two ladies. Mrs. Conner receives it\nnext morning, Tuesday, the 15th. I happened to call on Mrs. Conner that\nday, on another errand, when she hands me the letter, and verifies it in every\nessential particular to me verbally, from her side of the case. The little\naccident had happened exactly as Mrs. B. described it from the clairvoyant\nimage she perceived.\n'' You are at liberty to use the letter for publication, only suppressing the\nwriter's name. Its naivete and spontaneousness, and obvious lack of any\npossible afterthought, reflect the occurrence so perfectly that what I have\nwritten would be superfluous, were it not that I thus am able to attest,\nfrom Mrs. Conner herself, that the psychical impression made on Mrs. B.\nwas the exact reflection of an actual occurrence.\n\"Elliott Coubs.\"\nThe letter referred to is as follows :\u2014\n\" Monday Evening, January 1ith, 1889.\n\"My Dear Friend,\u2014I know you will be surprised to receive a note\nfrom me so soon, but not more so than I was to-day when you were shown\nto me clairvoyantly, in a somewhat embarrassed position.

You had on your black skirt and velvet waist,\nyour little straw bonnet, and in your hand were some papers. When you\nfell, your hat went in one direction and the papers in another. You got up\nvery quickly, put on your bonnet, picked up the papers, and lost no time\ngetting into the house. You did not appear to be. hurt, but looked some\nwhat mortified. It was all so plain to me that I had ten notions to one to\ndress myself and come over and see if it were true, but finally concluded\nthat a sober, industrious woman like yourself would not be stumbling\naround at that rate, and thought I'd best not go on a wild goose chase.\nNow, what do you think of such a vision as that ?

It was not more than a minute till I reached the steps where I\nfell, so that it must have been within a few seconds of 19 minutes to\nthree. I have no means of ascertaining whether the vision preceded\nthe accident.\"\nQuestion 3.\u2014\" Have you ever heard from Mrs. B. that she had any vision of\nyou of the kind, at any other time ? and, if so, was it correct 1 \"\nAnsicer 3.\u2014\"Mrs B. and myself are intimate friends. She had seen a\nvision of me once or twice previously, merely as an appearance, not\ndoing anything in particular.\"\nQuestion 4.\u2014\"For form's sake I will ask you to state whether a slip on the\nfront steps like this is unique in your experience 1 \"\nAnsicer 4.\u2014\" I have stumbled and fallen a few times in my life, not oftener\nthan other people.\"\n,\"To me the most convincing proof of the correctness of the vision is a\nsentence you will find like this, if I remember right, in the letter : ' I\ndo not know if there are steps from the sidewalk to the yard,' &c. The\nqueer fact is that there were two steps from the sidewalk to the yard,\nthe street having been cut down. On the top one of these two steps, in\nthe yard, I stumbled. Mrs. B. had never seen this house, I having only\nremoved thither a few days before.\n\"Eliza Archard Conner.\"\nThe next case, also American, resembles the two last, except that\nthe percipient's experience was a dream instead of a waking vision, and,\ntherefore, in so far as a dream is a more common experience than a\nwaking vision, more likely to have been due to chance coincidence,\nthough the correspondence in time, and the vividness and definiteness\n\f38 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nof the dream make this explanation very improbable. The percipient,\nMr. H. M. Lee, son of the late Dr. Henry Lee, Bishop of Iowa, writes\nto a relative as follows :\u2014\n\"Syracuse, N.Y., December 16th, 1887.\n(L. 869.) \" It will be well to understand that there was a peculiar bond\nof affection between my father and myself, more than is usual between\nfather and son, and for ye:irs I seemed to know and feel when he was in\ndanger, though many miles separated us. One of many instances I recall.\nDuring the war my father had occasion to go to Saint Joseph, Mo. To\nreach there he wont to Quincy, 111. , taking the Hannibal and Saint Joseph\nR.R. during the day. While I was attending to my duties in the bank, I\nsuddenly became aware that my father was in danger ; and upon his return\nI asked him about it. lie informed me the car he was in left the track and\nturned over twice in its descent down the embankment. The shock rendered\nhim unconscious, and, in fact, he was carried out for a dead man. It was\nfully twenty minutes before he returned to consciousness. Of course, he\nbeing so large and heavy, he was severely shaken up, but was able to con\ntinue his journey, and perform his duties. It was his intention to say\nnothing about the accident, as we were all of us anxious about him during his:\nvisitations, the times were so troublesome and so many trains derailed and\nfired into ; but when he found I knew about it\u2014hou; neither of us knew\u2014he\ntold me, in confidence, that the accident occurred at the time I was made\naware of it. Ever after that I seemed to follow him, and knew when he was.\nin danger, though powerless to prevent the disaster.\n\" On the night he fell downstairs [in 1874], I had returned home from\nmy business about eight o'clock, after a very hard day's work, and was very\ntired, so immediately after supper I retired. It is my practice to sleep on\nthe back side of the bed. We slept with our head to the north, bringing me\non the west side of the bed. I went to sleep as soon as my head touched the\npillow, and slept the sleep of exhaustion. I did not hear my wife come to\nbed, and knew nothing till I saw father at the top of the stairs in the act of\nfalling. I jumped to catch him and landed on the floor on my feet, with\nconsiderable noise. My wife awoke and wanted to know what on earth I\nwas trying to do. I by that time had lighted a lamp, and upon looking at\nmy watch found it was a quarter-past tvvro. I asked my wife if she heard\nthe crash. She said No. I then told her what I had seen, but she tried to\nlaugh me out of it, not succeeding, however. I slept no more that night ; in\nfact did not go to bed again ; so vivid was the whole thing to me that I knew\nfather was badly hurt. Early in the morning I went to town and telegraphed\nhome, inquiring if all was well, and received a letter from father which fully\ncorresponded with my vision to the very minute. The sad result of the fall\nwe all too well know, but how I, fully three hundred miles from him, smc\nhim fall I do not pretend to account for, and if you, in the course of your\ninvestigation, can throw any light on the matter, you will do me a great\nfavour by kindly writing me.\n\"H. M. Lee.\"\nMr. Hodgson received the following independent account of the same\nincident from the Bishop of Algowa.\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 3d\n\"Toronto, December 29th [1887].\n\" My Dear Sir,\u2014The incident in Bishop Lee's history, referred to in\nmy previous letter, was as follows :\u2014\n\" Some time during the summer of 1874 the Bishop occupied for the first\ntime a new residence (in either Davenport or Burlington, Iowa), built for\nhim by his diocese. Not being accustomed to the interior arrangements, he\none night took a false step, turning towards the stairway instead of his own\nroom, and fell down the stairs, a flight, I think, of twenty-one steps. As\nmight be expected, he was very seriously injured, though, strange to say, for\na man of his unusual weight, no bones were broken. Needing special care\nand medical treatment, the Bishop came to Hyde Park, near Chicago, in\nwhich city I was then residing. At the time of the Bishop's fall, one of his\nsons was resident in a city several hundred miles west of Iowa\u2014Denver, I\nthink. One night this son jumped up out of his sleep in a state of great\nalarm and excitement, crying out, ' Father has had a bad fall. ' His wife\nendeavoured to calm him, saying he had only had a bad dream, but his reply\nwas, ' No, it was no dream, I heard the fall. ' He rose, struck a light, and\nlooked at his watch. It was the very night on which and almost to the\nminute the very time at which the Bishop had fallen.\n\"This narrative I had from the Bishop's own lips. He died shortly after,\nof traumatic erysipelas.\n\" Commending this remarkable incident to the attention of your Society,\nI remain, &c,\n\" E. Sullivah, Bishop of Algowa.\"\nA case singularly like this, where Canon Warburton starts from\nsleep seeing his brother fall downstairs, will be found in Phantasms of\nthe Living (Vol. I., p. 338, No. 108). Compare also No. 24 in the same\nvolume, p. 202.\nThe next case was sent to us in August, 1890, by Madame A. do\nHolstein, of 29, Avenue de Wagram, Paris, an Associate of our Society\nwho has rendered us valuable assistance in other ways. It is somewhat\nless well evidenced than the last, since the dream was not mentioned to\nanyone before its veridical character was recognised ; it seems, however,\nto have made so much impression at the time on Dr. Golinski as to make\nit improbable that the details have been read back to any great extent.\nThe case is unlike those we have already quoted, in that the clairvoyant\nimpression appears to have been due not to any connection between\nagent and percipient, or any special crisis occurring to the agent, but\nto her intense anxiety to have his assistance. The narrative was sent\nto us in French and we give here a translation, omitting a few medical\ndetails which do not materially affect the case.\n(L. 870.) Dr. Golinski, practising at Krementchug, in Russia, com\nmunicates to us the following incident :\u2014\n\" I am in the habit of dining at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and\nof sleeping for an hour or an hour and a half after the meal. In July, 1888,\n\f40 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nI lay down on a sofa as usual, and went to sleep about 3.30. I dreamt that\nthe door bell rang, and that I had the usual rather disagreeable sensation\nthat I must get up and go to some siek person. Then I found myself trans\nported directly into a little room with dark hangings. To the right of the\ndoor leading into the room is a chest of drawers, and on this I see a little\nparaffin lamp of a special pattern. I am keenly interested in the shape of\nthis little lamp, different from any it has previously happened to me to see.\nTo the left of the door I see a bed, on which lies a woman suffering from\nsevere haemorrhage. I do not know how I come to know that she has a\nhaemorrhage, but I know it. I examine her, but rather to satisfy my\nconscience than for any other reason, as I know beforehand how things are,\nalthough no one speaks to me. Afterwards I dream vaguely of medical\nassistance which I give, and then I awake in an unaccustomed manner.\nGenerally I awake slowly, and remain for some minutes in a drowsy state,\nbut this time I awoke almost with a start, as if someone had awakened me.\nAs I awoke I heard a clock strike the half-hour. I asked myself, ' What\nhalf-hour is it then 1 ' and looking at my watch I saw that it was half-past four.\n' ' I got up, smoked a cigarette, and walked up and down my room in a\nstate of unusual excitement, thinking over the dream I had just had. It\nwas rather a long time since I had had a case of haemorrhage of any sort\namong my clients, and I wondered what could have suggested this dream.\n\"About 10 minutes after I awoke the door bell rang, and I was\nsummoned to a patient. Entering the bedroom I was astonished, for I\nrecognised the room of which I had just dreamt. The patient was a sick\nwoman, and what struck me especially was the paraffin lamp placed on the\nchest of drawers exactly in the same place as in my dream, and of the sa%e\npattern, which I had never seen before. My astonishment was so great that\nI, so to speak, lost the clear distinction between the past dream and the\npresent reality, and, approaching the sick woman's bed, said affirmatively,\n' You have a haemorrhage ! ' only recovering myself when the patient\nreplied, ' Yes, but how do you know it ? ' . . .\n\"Struck with the strange coincidence between my dream and what I saw,\nI asked the patient when she had decided to send for me. She told me that\nshe had been unwell since the morning. About 1 p.m. a slight haemorrhage\ncommenced and some pain, but she paid no attention to it. The haemorrhage\nbecame severe after 2 o'clock and the patient began to grow anxious. Her\nhusband not being at home she did not know what to do, and lay down,\nthinking it would pass. Between 3 and 4 o'clock she was still undecided and\nin great anxiety. About 4.30 she decided to send for me. The distance\nbetween my house and that of the patient is 20 minutes' walk.\n\" I only knew her from having attended her in illness some time before,\nand knew nothing of her present state of health.\n\" In a general way I seldom dream, and this is the only dream I ever had\nwhich I have always remembered, on account of its veridical character.\"\nDr. Golinski left Paris suddenly for Russia without having signed the\nabove account, which was taken down from his lips in Russian by Madame\nde Holstein and translated by her into French. Subsequently he wrote to\nMr. Myers a letter, of which we translate part as follows :\u2014\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 41\n\" Lubny, Government of Poltava, Russia, October 15th, 1890.\n\" Sir,\u2014I have received from Dr. Holstein, of Paris, a letter asking me to\nconfirm all that he has written to you as to the veridical dream which I had\nlast year [really two years before]. It was the first time in my life that I\nhad a similar sleep, and it seemed to me so remarkable that I related it to\nmy friend Dr. Holstein, asking Madame Holstein to take notes in English\nfor the Psychical Society of London. I have re-read the notes taken by\nMadame Holstein, concerning a dream which I had in the month of July,\n1888, and I can state here that these notes are exact. I should add that I\npractise medicine, and that psychological questions are not unfamiliar to me,\nbut in psychology, as in science in general, I am too much of a positivist to\ndraw conclusions from this or any similar facts. Where you see indubitable\npsychical action I see only a chance coincidence. But I value facts above\ntheories, and it is for that reason that I am glad to be useful to the Psychical\nSociety of London. . . .\n\"0. Golinski.\"\nWe may perhaps compare with this case No. 141, Phantasms of the\nLiving (Vol. I., p. 379), though the parallelism is not very close.\nI pass on to a case of an entirely different character, and which is\nspecially interesting as belonging to the rare class of \"reciprocal\" cases\n\u2014cases, that is, where there appears to be a mutual perception between\nthe parties concerned; both are agents and both percipients. In the\npresent instance there is the further complication that a third person\nshared the percipience of one of them. The experience of only one of\nthe persons concerned\u2014Mrs. Wilmot\u2014rbears on our present subject.\nShe seemed to herself to be transported to the distant scene where her\nhusband was, and did actually apparently learn some details about his\nsurroundings which she is hardly likely to have imagined. The case is\nagain an American one. The first letter quoted is addressed to Colonel\nT. W. Higginson, an Associate of the American Branch.\n\"Bridgeport, Ct., December 18th, 1889.\n(L. 871.) \"If the enclosed narrative is of any interest to the Committee\nof the Society for Psychical Research it may be placed in the archives or be\npublished.

Mr. Wilmot and his wife and\nsister are still living here, and would, no doubt, be happy to answer any\nquestions about the matter.\n' ' He does not know that I have had his narrative compared with a tile of\nthe New York Herald, as per memorandum appended. It seems to stand the\ntest pretty well, however.\n\"If published, please do not give my name, as I have simply acted as\nscribe, and have no personal knowledge about the incidents.\n\"W. B. H.\"\nWith this letter was sent a copy of the original manuscript, which runs\nas follows :\u2014\n\f42 Mrs. H. Sidgwiek.\n\"On October 3rd, 1863, I sailed from Liverpool for New York, on the\nsteamer City of Limerick, of the Inman line, Captain Jones commanding. On\nthe evening of the second day out, soon after leaving Kinsale Head, a severe\nstorm began, which lasted for nine days. During this time we saw neither\nsun nor stars nor any vessel ; the bulwarks on the weather bow were carried\naway, one of the anchors broke loose from its lashings, and did considerable\ndamage before it could be secured, and several stout storm sails, though\nclosely reefed, were carried away, and the booms broken.\n\"Upon the night following the eighth day of the storm the tempest\nmoderated a little, and for the first time since leaving port I enjoyed refresh\ning sleep. Toward morning I dreamed that I saw my wife, whom I had left\nin the United States, come to the door of my state-room, clad in her night\ndress. At the door she seemed to discover that I was not the only occupant\nof the room, hesitated a little, then advanced to my side, stooped down\nand kissed me, and after gently caressing me for a few moments, quietly\nwithdrew.\n\"Upon waking I was surprised to see my fellow passenger, whose berth\nwas above mine, but not directly over it\u2014owing to the fact that our room\nwas at the stern of the vessel\u2014leaning upon his elbow, and looking fixedly\nat me. 'You're a pretty fellow,' said he at length, 'to have a lady come\nand visit you in this way.' I pressed him for an explanation, which he at\nfirst declined to give, but at length related what he had seen while wide\nawake, lying in his berth. It exactly corresponded with my dream.\n'' This gentleman's name was William J. Tait, and he had been my\nroom-mate in the passage out, in the preceding July, on the Cunard steamer\nOlympus; a native of England, and son of a clergyman of the Established\nChurch. He had for a number of years lived in Cleveland, in the State of\nOhio, where he held the position of librarian of the Associated Library. He\nwas at this time perhaps fifty years of age\u2014by no means in the habit of\npractical joking, but a sedate and very religious man, whose testimony upon\nany subject could be taken unhesitatingly.\n' ' The incident seemed so strange to me that I questioned him about it,\nand upon three separate occasions, the last one shortly before reaching port,\nMr. Tait repeated to me the same account of what he had witnessed. On\nreaching New York we parted, and I never saw him afterward, but I\nunderstand that he died, a number of years ago, in Cleveland.\n\" The day after landing I went by rail to Watertown, Conn., where my\nchildren and my wife had been for some time, visiting her parents. Almost\nher first question, when we were alone together, was, ' Did you receive a\nvisit from me a week ago Tuesday V 'A visit from you ? ' said I, ' we were\nmore than a thousand miles at sea. ' ' I know it, ' she replied, ' but it seemed\nto me that I visited you.' 'It would be impossible,' said I. 'Tell me what\nmakes you think so.'\n\" My wife then told me that on account of the severity of the weather\nand the reported loss of the Africa, which sailed for Boston on the same day\nthat we left Liverpool for New York, and had gone ashore at Cape Race,\nshe had been extremely anxious about me. On the night previous, the same\nnight when, as mentioned above, the storm had just begun to abate, she had\nlain awake for a long time thinking of me, and about four o'clock in the\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance.\nmorning it seemed to her that she went out to seek me. Crossing the wide\nand stormy sea, she came at length to a low, black steamship, whose side she-\nwent up, and then descending into the cabin, passed through it to the stem\nuntil she came to my state-room. 'Tell me,' said she, 'do they ever have\nstate-rooms like the one I saw, where the upper berth extends further back\nthan the under one ? A man was in the upper berth, looking right at\nme, and for a moment I was afraid to go in, but soon I went up to the side\nof your berth, bent down and kissed you, and embraced you, and then\nwent away. '\n\" The description given by my wife of the steamship was correct in all\nparticulars, though she had never seen it. I find by my sister's diary that we\nsailed October 4th ; the day we reached New York, 22nd ; home, 23rd.\n\" With the above corrections I can very willingly subscribe my name.\n\" S. R. Wilmot.\n'' Should you desire to rewrite this and have me sign my name in ink, I\nwill willingly do so, and my wife will add hers to the correctness of her\ndream.\u2014S. R. W.\"\nLater, Mr. W. B. H. sent the original manuscript to Mr. Hodgson to\nexamine, saying :\u2014\n\"February 21st, 1890.\n\" I send you herewith, not to keep, but to be returned to me after examina\ntion, the narrative, as I wrote it down some five years ago, after hearing him\n[Mr. Wilmot] tell the story.

She was put about before she\nstruck, but took ground fore, aft, and amidships. There was considerable sea\nrunning, with a southerly wind at the time. The steamer's boats were got\nready, but not launched. The Africa floated off after an hour, and was\nspeedily cleared of water by her pumps. Captain Stone then headed her foi-\nHalifax, but soon deemed it prudent to put into St. John's, Newfoundland.\nBoth cargo and vessel were badly damaged.

At my ' No, why ? ' he said he\nsaw some woman, in white, who went up to my brother (who was too seasick\nto leave his berth for several days). I soon went in to see [my brother], who told\nme that Mr. Tait had wondered at my coming in to see him, and I think he\nsaid he had dreamed of seeing his wife there, but in the imminent danger\nthat loomed over us, I did not fix my mind on their after conversations.\n\" I think my brother must have written to Mr. Tait the share my sister\nhad in the vision\u2014shall I call it ? When visiting at the Taits' in Cleveland,\ntwo or three years after, he spoke of the wonderful coincidence. It evidently\nimpressed him. If he were still living, I would refer you to him.\n\" Eliza E. Wilmot.\"\nMrs. Wilmot says :,\u2014\n\" Bridgeport, Conn., February 27th, 1890.\n\"... In reply to the question, Did I ' notice any details about the\nman I saw in the upper berth ? ' I cannot at this late day positively say that I\n,did, but I distinctly remember that I felt much disturbed at his presence, as\nho leaned over, looking at us.\n\" I think that I told my mother the next morning about my dream ; and\nI know that I had a very vivid sense all the day of having visited my husband :\nthe impression was so strong that I felt unusually happy and refreshed, to\n1ny surprise.\n' ' In regard to ' other analogous experiences, ' the following may seem out\nof place, perhaps, but I will give it, although my husband had no part in it.\n' ' In December, 1887 (I believe the 18th), I was awakened out of a sound\n1 Mr. Hodgson called on Mr. Wilmot on December 10th, 1890, and learnt from\nliim that one of these dreams, which occurred to him when a lad, was apparently of a\nclairvoyant kind. He dreamt of a cow bearing a calf with peculiar marks of colour.\nIn his dream he saw that the cow had broken out of her stall, pulling the bars down,\nand the calf was born in a pool of dirty water and was in danger of suffocation.\nHe went to the stall before breakfast, owing to his dream, and found details as he\nhad dreamt them.\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 45\nsleep with a dreadful realisation that my daughter, who was on a journey to.\nCalifornia, was in some terrible danger\u2014everything seemed dark and frightful\nand full of confusion.\n*****\n\"It seemed more strange, because that very Sunday evening we were\nrejoicing in the thought of her safe arrival at Los Angeles, expecting next\nmorning to have a telegram to that effect. None came till evening ; then\nfrom El Paso, with the startling news there had been a collision, but they\nwere all right. I immediately thought of my experience of the night before,\nand believed it was at the same time\u2014calculating the difference in time\u2014\nabout ten at night, when they came very near being thrown off a steep\nembankment, engines smashed, &c, but my daughter preserved.\n*****\n\"Mrs. S. R. Wilmot.\"\nThis is a very remarkable case, and merits careful examination. It\nis somewhat remote\u2014the account was not written apparently for more\nthan twenty years after the occurrence, and one of the percipients is\ndead and cannot give a first-hand account of what he saw. We\nmust not assume that after so long a time the memory of the witnesses,\nhowever good, will be exact, and that every detail can be absolutely\nrelied on. Still, after making all allowances, it is, I think, clear that\nthere was a remarkable correspondence between the experiences of three\npersons. Mrs. Wilmot had\u2014waking or sleeping\u2014a vision of her\nhusband, in which she correctly perceived some part of his surroundings ;\nMr. Wilmot dreamt his wife's thoughts ; and Mr. Tait had a waking\nhallucination which corresponded with the main features of Mr.\nWilmot's dream. It is difficult to say whether there was really any\ndifference in kind between Mr. and Mrs. Wilmot's experiences. Each\nperceived the other in the situation in which the other supposed\nhimself or herself to be. But, in so doing, Mrs. Wilmot was made\naware supernormally of certain actual facts which would have been\ncognisable by her senses had she been in her husband's cabin in the\nbody. She was, therefore, in some sense clairvoyant at the moment.\nThis case differs from those that precede it. In them the clairvoyant\nperson was apparently a passive recipient of the telepathic impulse\nfrom the agent which led to the clairvoyant perception. But here,\nMrs. Wilmot seems, as it were, to have actively sought communication\nwith her husband. I should still hold with Mr. Gurney1 that this is\nno reason for regarding the incident as other than telepathic, for there\n1 In connection with this case the chapters in Phantasms of the Living on\nKeciprocal Cases (Vol. II., chap, xvii., and Supplement, chap, viii.) should be read, as\nshould also Case 35 (Vol. I., p. 225), Caae 94 (Vol. I., p. 319), and one given in a foot\nnote Vol. I., p. 110. Several eases among these will be found to have much analogy\nwith the one before us. It is also worth turning to Case 341, in Vol. II., p. 227,\nthough this is not clearly reciprocal.\n\f40 Mrs. H. Sidgivick.\nis as little ground for supposing that Mrs. Wilmot could have perceived\npsychically any cabin as there is for thinking that Mrs. Paquet could\nhave had a vision of any death scene. In other words, it is probable\nthat the presence of the husband and brother respectively were\nessential conditions of the percipience, which, therefore, depended on\nsome unknown process of communication from mind to mind. The\nfact that Mr. Wilmot at the same time dreamt of his wife seems to me,\nif anything, to strengthen the telepathic hypothesis, because it shows\nthat there was actually a community of mental impressions.\nBut it may be said that it is more difficult thus to account for Mr.\nTait's seeing a figure at the same time as Mr. Wilmot, and that this at\nleast tends to show that Mrs. Wilmot was actually there in some sense\nother than a purely mental one. The question here raised is the\ndifficult one of the significance of Collective psychical experiences, for a\nfull discussion of which I must refer my readers to Phantasms of the\nLiving1 ; for though it may no doubt prove ultimately to be of great\ntheoretic importance in connection with clairvoyance, it enters too little\ninto the evidence for this, so far as it has yet been collected, to require\nmore than a brief notice here. Briefly, then, besides the possibility of a\ndirect telepathic communication between the primary agent and both\npercipients, there are two hypotheses to account for collective hallucina\ntions,\u2014assuming of course that they are not due to suggestion by word\nor gesture. One is that there is some kind of objective presence, some\ncentre of \" phantasmogenetic efficacy,\" 2 located in space and within\nrange of the operation of the percipient's senses. The other is that\nthe primary percipient, B, whether his own impression is due to tele\npathy or is purely subjective, becomes an agent as regards the secondary\npercipient C, who receives his impression by thought-transference from\nor through B.\nIt is this second view which I agree with Mr. Gurney in thinking\nthe most probable, and I may mention, as an example of cases which it\nis very difficult to explain on any other hypothesis, an experiment of\n1 See chapter on Collective cases, Vol. II., especially section 7, p. 2G4, and Mr.\nMyers's note on \" A Suggested Method of Psychical Interaction,\"in the same volume.\n2 Phantasms, Vol. II., p. 289. The advocates of this hypothesis in any cruder or\nmore materialistic form than that adopted by Mr. Myers in the passages referred to,\nwould probably hardly apply it in the present case, since the phantasm was not seen\nby both men looking at the same spot with open eyes, but Mr. Wilmot's dream was\nMr. Tait's hallucination. This particular type of collective experience seems, how\never, to be comparatively rare. An instance is given in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. V.,\np. 438, and another\u2014rather more doubtful\u2014in Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II.,\np. 215, No. 332 (also quoted in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. III., p. 87). We have also a\nsecond-hand case (B.L. 91) sent by the Rev. A. Starkey, who heard from Mrs. Ogden,\na nurse\u2014now dead\u2014that when sleeping beside her f-ick child, she dreamt that her\ndeceased husband stood at the foot of the bed, and that the child afterwards stated\nthat he had seen his father there.\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 47\n\"Wesermann, a gentleman who interested himself in thought-trans\nference in the beginning of the century. By concentrated effort of\nthought, he had more than once imposed dreams on distant friends, and\nhe determined to make Lieutenant N. dream that a certain lady, who\nhad been dead for five years, came to him and incited him to good works.\nHe supposed that Lieutenant N\\ was at home and asleep at the time\nselected, but, as it happened, he was staying in a different town with a\nfriend, Lieutenant S., who was a stranger to Wesermann, and both\nwere wide awake and talking. This did not interfere with the success\nof Wesermann's experiment, however, for both gentlemen saw a figure\nresembling the lady in question enter the room noiselessly by a door\nthat usually creaked, make gestures of greeting and go out again.1 It\nwill hardly, I think, be contended that Wesermann called up the dead\nlady, or that he himself appeared in her form, or that Lieutenant\n8. would have seen her if Lieutenant N. had not been there, so that\nthere seems to be no reasonable alternative except that of a telepathic\naction of Wesermann's mind on Lieutenant \"N., communicated in some\nway through him to Lieutenant S.\nThe five cases of distinctly telepathic clairvoyance above given are,\nI think, fairly representative, though they have been selected on the\nsimple principle of taking, so far as I know, all the experiences of this\ntype of which accounts have reached us since the publication of Phan\ntasms of the Living and of the Proceedings of the American Societyfor\nPsychical Research, and thus have been included in neither ; and which\nalso seem to reach a sufficiently high evidential standard.2\nBefore proceeding further, I will give a case sent by Mrs. Alfred\nWedgwood which it is difficult either to estimate or to classify. The\ndream may have been due to latent memory, Mrs. Wedgwood having\nmore previous knowledge of the house than she remembered. It may\nhave been telepathic, depending on the waking or sleeping thoughts of\nthe cousin, occupied with the party and her intended guests. Or again,\nit may have been a case of clairvoyance of a more independent kind.\nFebruary, 1884.\n(M. 304.) \"I spent the Christmas holidays with my father-in-law in\n1 Wesermann wrot9 three accounts of this experiment. The fullest is in a book by\nhim called Dcr Magnctismus und die allgemeine Wcltsprachc, published in 1822.

Sidgwick.\nQueen Anne-street, and in the beginning of January I had a remarkably\nvivid dream, which I told to him next morning at breakfast.\n\" I dreamt I went to a strange house, standing at the corner of a street.\nWhen I reached the top of the stairs I noticed a window opposite with a\nlittle coloured glass, short muslin blinds running on a brass rod. The top of\nthe ceiling had a window veiled by gathered muslin. There were two small\nshrubs on a little table. The drawing-room had a bow window, with the\nsame blinds ; the library had a polished floor, with the same blinds.\n\" As I was going to a child's party at a cousin's, whose house I had never\nseen, I told my father-in-law I thought that that would prove to be the\nhouse.\n\"On January 10th I went with my little boy to the party, and, by mis\ntake, gave the driver a wrong number. When he stopped at No. 20, I had\nmisgivings about the house, and remarked to the cabman that it was not a\ncorner house. The servant could not tell me where Mrs. H. lived, and had\nnot a blue-book. Then I thought of my dream, and as a last resource I\nwalked down the street looking up for the peculiar blinds I had observed in\nmy dream. These I met with at No. 50, a corner house, and knocking at\nthe door, was relieved to find that it was the house of which I was in search.\n\"On going upstairs the room and windows corresponded exactly with\nwhat I had seen in my dream, and the same little shrubs in their pots were\nstanding on the landing. The window in which I had seen the coloured glass\nwas hidden by the blind being drawn down, but I learnt, on inquiry, that it\nwas really there.\n\"Margaret R. Wedgwood.\"\nMr. Hensleigh Wedgwood writes :\u2014\n\" 31, Queen Anne-street, February 7th, 1884.\n'' My daughter-in-law told me her dream the morning after it occurred,\nand described her recognition of the house when first I saw her afterwards.\nI have ascertained that she did make the inquiries at Mrs. H. 's house of\nwhich she speaks, and that the window has an edging of coloured glass.\n\"H. Wedgwood.\"\nAsked whether she recognises, when she wakes from a dream, that it is\none which will turn out to correspond with reality, Mrs. Wedgwood says that\nshe does : that though these dreams are not more vivid than others which\nshe has, she has a \"presentiment\" which haunts her about the ones which\nturn out true.\nI pass on now to cases where the telepathy, if it exists, is, as a rule,\nmore obscure\u2014where, though the knowledge obtained by the clairvoyant\nwas certainly possessed at the time by other persons, it is less clear that\nits possession by them was in any way a condition of its being obtained\nby the clairvoyant. For in these cases\u2014which are generally more or\nless experimental\u2014we find that not only is it the percipient who is in\nthe abnormal psychical state (generally hypnotised), and with whom\nthe psychical activity which produced the clairvoyance apparently\noriginates, but the supposed agent is often entirely normal, passing;\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance.\nthrough no crisis or excitement of any kind, unconscious of any-\npsychical interaction between himself and the percipient and even\nunaware of the percipient's existence. It will, nevertheless, be noticed\nthat in some instances the kind of percipience suggests mind-reading\nrather than any more direct method of acquiring the knowledge.\nThe first of these cases belongs to the period of mesmeric activity\nof forty years ago, but was fortunately recorded at the time, and before\nthe truth of the clairvoyant's statement was known. The narrator, Mr.\nWilliam Boyd, F.R.S.E., is a 'lawyer residing at Peterhead, in\nAberdeenshire.\n(M. 18.) Clairvoyance Forty Years Ago.\n\" The particulars I am to relate attracted much public attention at the\ntime when they occurred, and they have still a recognised place in the\nauthentic local history of Peterhead. I nevertheless accede to a suggestion\nwhich has been made to me, that I should place them on record in these\nProceedings, while it is possible to adduce, if required, the evidence of\npersons still living in support of them.\n'' I premise by saying that forty years ago a fleet of eleven vessels, includ\ning two named respectively the Hamilton Ross and Eclipse, sailed yearly, in\nearly spring, from the Port of Peterhead for the prosecution of the seal and\nwhale fisheries in the Arctic seas. These vessels carried each, on an average,\nfifty men ; their annual voyage generally lasted from three to six months, and\nfrom the time when they sailed until their return, communication between\nthem and this country was absolutely impossible.\n\"In the year 1850, what was then familiarly known as mesmerism received\na good deal of attention at Peterhead, and, with others of my acquaintance,\nI was interested in it. At that time I acted as a local correspondent of the\nAberdeen Journal newspaper, and I contributed to it the following statement,\nwhich was published in that paper on May 8th, 1850 :\u2014\n\"'Whether the science of mesmerism is real or fanciful we do not\npretend to be able to decide, but we venture to narrate a few facts\nwhich have come under our observation, and which are no less curious\nthan capable of being most amply authenticated. On the 23rd of last month\n(April) a lad was thrown into the mesmeric state here, and, as may\nnaturally be supposed, the first questions put to him by the operator\nrelated to the vessels engaged at the seal fishery. The patient having\nbeen in imagination transported to the icy regions, he had no difficulty\nin satisfying the curiosity of his querists. He stated in answer that the\nfirst ship which would arrive here this season would be the Hamilton\nRoss, and that he at that moment saw the captain and surgeon of the vessel\nengaged in dressing the hand of the second mate, Cardno, who, he said, had\naccidentally lost part of some of his fingers.\n' ' ' Next evening the experiment was repeated, and the lad, when\nasked as to the success of the other vessels, and in particular of the\nEclipse, said that Captain Burnett, of the Hamilton Ross, would, on his.\narrival, inform them of that, as he was then engaged in conversation with\nthe captain of the Eclipse, who he said was giving him news. This state-\nE\n\f50 Mrs. H. Sidgwiek.\nment, as might have been expected, did not gain the confidence of even the\nmost credulous advocates of the truth of the science, and, having given rise\nto a little amusement and speculation at the time, was soon forgotten. On\nMay 3rd, however, the first whaler of the season arrived, and, agree\nably to the statement of the clairvoyant, proved to be the Hamilton Ross.\nThe ship having been brought into the bay, a boat came on shore with\nCaptain Burnett (the master), and, as usual, all were eager to hear the news.\nAs the boat neared the quay, the appearance of a man sitting in the stern\nbesides the captain was not very easily accounted for. Soon, however, the\nwell-known features of Cardno, the second mate, were recognised, and on its\nbeing discovered that one of his arms was in a sling a general cry arose from\nthe assembled crowd to the effect that the statement which had been made\nrespecting him had proved correct, and it turns out that he had actually\naccidentally shot away portions of some of his fingers when at the fishing.\nTo these remarkable coincidences one more remains to be added. Captain\nBurnett left the ice on April 24th, and the night- before leaving he\nmet with Captain Gray, of the Eclipse, from whom he received the most of\nthe information which he has brought regarding the other ships. He was\nconsequently engaged on the evening of April 23rd, exactly as the clairvoyant\nhad described him to be. We have thus, it will be observed, confined\nourselves to a bare recital of the facts of this (it must be allowed) extra\nordinary case, and have been at pains to advance nothing but what can be\nfully authenticated, and as we have before confessed ourselves unable to\nfathom the mysteries of the science, we forbear to offer any comment upon\nthem. '\n\"I call attention to what is obviously a slight error in the foregoing\nstatement, in the dates when the two seances described are reported to have\ntaken place. It is said by me that Captain Burnett was found to have been\nengaged on the evening of April 23rd, exactly as the clairvoyant had\ndescribed him to be, which shows that I should have stated that the first\n.seance occurred on April 22nd, and the second on April 23rd, and not on\nApril 23rd and 24th, as might be inferred from the former part of my state\nment, although the existence of the error is made apparent towards the con\nclusion of it, as well as by the other evidence to which I shall refer.\n. \" The particulars I related were mainly within my own knowledge, for I\nhad heard of the clairvoyant's statements at least several days before the\narrival of the Hamilton Ross, and, along with hundreds of others, I witnessed\nher arrival, and saw the boat land the wounded man. I also heard, with\nfeelings which I shall never forget, the murmur of surprise which passed\nthroughout the assembled crowd when it was discovered that, in the words\nwhich were freely used around me, ' the mesmerism had come true. '\n\"Mr. W. L. Taylor, bookseller, Peterhead, who then acted as local\n,correspondent for the Aberdeen Herald newspaper, wrote on the day of\nthe arrival of the Hamilton Ross a paragraph to a similar effect as that\nwritten by me for the Aberdeen Journal, which appeared in the Herald, of\nMay 11th, 1850, with the addition of the following incredulous remark by\nthe editor : ' The coincidence would have appeared more curious had the\nfact been stated before the arrival of the vessel. ' Mr. Taylor had, however,\nbefore the arrival of the Hamilton Ross, received from Mr. Wm. Reid, shoe\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. $1\nmaker in Peterhead, who operated in throwing the lad into the mesmeric\ncondition, a written statement of what had taken place at the seances, for the\npurpose of being forwarded for publication in the Herald, but he was dis\nsuaded by the advice of a friend from sending it to the editor at the time\nwhen it was handed to him in case it might prove to be an imposture. In\nconsequence, however, of the editor's incredulous remark before mentioned,\nMr. Taylor, on seeing it, at once forwarded the original manuscript for\npublication, and it appeared in the Aberdeen Herald of May 18th, 1850. The\nfollowing are extracts from Mr. Reid's statement :\u2014\n\" ' On the evening of April 22nd I put John Park, tailor, aged 22, into a.\nstate of clairvoyance, in presence of twelve respectable inhabitants of this\ntown. ' (Here follows a description of certain statements regarding the fate of\nFranklin's expedition and the ships Erebus and Terror, which the light of\ninformation subsequently received proved to have been inaccurate.) 'He\n{the clairvoyant) then visited Old Greenland, as was desired, and having\ngone on board the Hamilton Soss, a whale-ship belonging to this port, saw\nDavid Cardno, second mate, getting his hand bandaged up by the doctor in\nthe cabin, having got it injured while sealing. He was then told by the\ncaptain that they had upwards of 100 tons of oil. I again, on the evening of\nthe 23rd, put him into a clairvoyant state.' (Here follow some further\nparticulars regarding Sir John Franklin's expedition, which also are proved\nto have been inaccurate.) ' I again directed him to Old Greenland, and he\nagain visited the Hamilton Ross, and found Captain Gray, of the Eclipse,\nconversing with the captain about the seal fishing being up.\n(Signed) 'William Reid.'\n\" Both Captain Burnett, of the Hamilton Ross, and Captain Gray, of the\nEclipse, died many years ago, and it is believed that their logs and ships'\npapers, which might have thrown some light on the concluding portion of\nMr. Reid's statement, have been lost or dispersed. But Mr. Taylor's article\nin the Aberdeen Herald, already referred to, written as he says on Captain\nBurnett's personal assurance of its accuracy, contained the following para\ngraph : ' It only remains to bo added that the mate Cardno's hand was\nundoubtedly hurt, and that on the date mentioned Captain Gray, of the\nEclipse, was on board the Hamilton Ross.' I never heard of this assertion\nhaving been contradicted, but Captain Gray's son, who is still alive, and was\nthen serving on board the Eclipse, testifies that a meeting between his father\nand Captain Burnett actually did take place, just before the departure of the\nlatter from Greenland, although he says it was on board the Hamilton Ross\nand not the Eclipse as was stilted. And the possible and probable date of the\nmeeting may be deduced from the following facts. The Hamilton Ross,\n-which was a sailing vessel, arrived on May 3rd, and the ordinary duration of\nthe voyage of such a vessel from Greenland is from eight to ten days. It\nfollows, therefore, that April 23rd must have been about the date of the com\nmencement of her return voyage, when the two masters could have conversed\nas stated by the clairvoyant about the seal fishing being up.\n\"One more reference to Mr. Reid's narrative. The clairvoyant stated\non the occasion of the first seance that he was told the Hamilton Ross had\n' upwards of 109 tons of oil. ' The success of Captain Burnett in that\nvessel in the previous vear, when he had onlv about 1U tons, was not\nE 2\n\f52 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nlikely to suggest, or lead to the expectation, that he would be so fortunate\nas to secure upwards of 100 tons of oil in 1850, yet the quantity he actually\nbrought home that year was 159 tons.\n\" Mr. Taylor and Mr. Reid are both alive. They have seen this state\nment and approve of it in every respect.\n\" It has been suggested to me that I should add the following facts, of\nwhich I have only recently heard, in case it should be supposed that they, or\nany of them, have a bearing on the case.\n' ' Some years prior to the occurrence of the events I have recorded, David\nCardno, before he joined the Hamilton Ross, and while serving in another\nvessel, met with an accident at Greenland, while using a winch, whereby\nhe lost the point of one of his fingers. Park was acquainted with Cardno,\nand may thus have known of his former accident. Both parties are now\ndead. Mr. Reid, the operator, was intimately acquainted with Cardno, but\nhe cannot remember whether he was aware, when he operated on Park, of\nCardno's former accident, or, indeed, whether he ever heard of it, until a\nfew days ago, when he was told of it by me.\n'' The figures I gave at the outset will enable anyone who may wish to\ndo so to calculate the odds against naming successfully the ship, the man,\nand the nature of the accident, to which the statement by the clairvoyant\nrelated, if the circumstances narrated are to be referred to the operation of\nthat which is termed chance.\n\"William Boyd, F.R.S.E.\n\"October, 1890.\"\nIn a later communication Mr. Boyd adds :\u2014\n\" On receipt of your letter, I had pleasure in obtaining (which I did from\nMr. Reid) the information necessary to enable me to reply to your questions,\nand I shall answer them in their order.\n(1) \"The only occasions on which Park was hypnotised were the two\nmentioned in my narrative as having happened on two successive days. In\nMr. Reid's words\u2014'Park was so frightened by the \"astounding\" result.*\nwhich followed, that he would never try it again. ' On both occasions he\nreadily passed into the clairvoyant state, the operation having taken on each\noccasion 6 to 7 minutes.\n(2) \"Mr. Reid knew Captain Burnett only by sight, and never spoke to\nhim, either before or after the occurrences narrated. He is sure that Park\nalso knew him only by sight. Mr. Reid cannot recollect having known any\nof the crew of the Hamilton Ross besides Cardno, with the exception of one\nman named John McNaughton. . . . Park was also acquainted with\nMcNaughton, but Mr. Reid does not know whether he was acquainted with\nany others of the crew of the Hamilton Ross. \"\nIt is, I think, difficult to suppose that either chance coincidence or\nshrewd guessing can account for the amount of correspondence between\nvision and fact in this case, even assuming that Cardno's previous acci\ndent may have had something to do with suggesting an injury to his\nhand. There is, however, a good deal to be said in favour of a telepathic\nexplanation, as against independent clairvoyance, although it involves\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 53\nan extension of our conception of telepathy. It is true that the\n,\"agents,\" if we may regard Cardno and Captain Burnett as such, were\nsought out by the percipient, and that we have no reason to think that\nthey were at all aware of any psychical interaction, or had their\nthoughts in any way directed towards the percipient. Still Cardno,\n&t any rate, was known both to clairvoyant and hypnotiser, and we are\nperhaps justified in assuming that such acquaintance was an important,\nif not an essential, condition to success with this particular percipient,\nbecause he failed in giving correct information about Sir John Franklin's\n,expedition, where no similar link was possible. Again, it will be ob\nserved that Park conceived himself as holding a conversation with the\ncaptain\u2014or at least as learning from him orally\u2014about the amount of\n,oil secured. This suggests that he learnt the facts telepathically rather\nthan by any method independent of other human minds.\nIt is worth noting that Park did not simply fail to give information\n,about Sir John Franklin's expedition ; he gave false information. Ex\nperience seems to show that clairvoyants are often\u2014generally perhaps\n\u2014unable to distinguish true impressions from false ones. The scenes\nthey seem to themselves to visit may be the work of their own imagina\ntion, or of the verbal or mental suggestion of others, or may be\nveridical, as in the cases we are discussing, without the clairvoyant\nperceiving any difference.\n(M. 650.) I will take next accounts of a clairvoyant whom we will\n,call \"Jane,\" and who was the wife of a pitman in the county of\nDurham. Mr. F. W. H. Myers, who collected the evidence, writes :\u2014\n\" She has never received any fee, or made any exhibition of her powers.\nOn the contrary, she has most carefully concealed her faculty from all her\nneighbours and relations, except her husband and sister, for fear of being\n,taken for a witch. The witnesses of her clairvoyance have consequently\nbeen few, consisting, mainly, of a family in whose service one or two of her\nrelations had been. We have the testimony of three members of this family,\nviz., the Rev. C. Green and his two sisters, who are now Mrs. Fraser and\nMrs. Myers (wife of the Rev. T. Myers, of Twinstead Rectory, Sudbury, a\ncousin of my own), who has kindly rendered active help in the collection of\n,evidence. To these are added some notes taken by their friend Mrs. Russell.\nWe have also the contemporaneous notes of a Dr. F., which form the main\npiece of evidence still subsisting ; though they do not appear to have been\ncontemporaneous in the sense of being made before the truth of Jane's\nstatements was verified. Singularly enough, it appears that none of these\nwitnesses, with the exception of Dr. F., at all realised the rarity of Jane's\nfaculty, and hardly any notes were made at the time.\n\" She was mesmerised at intervals through a long period of years from\n1845 onwards, for the sake of her health, 1 and when in the mesmeric state,\n1 The treatment was begun by the arrangement of her medical attendant with a\nview to enabling her to sleep at night. (See Mrs. Fraser's account, Appendix, p. 89.)\n\f5t Mrs. H. Sidgtv'uk.\nshe almost always began to talk in a childish language, and to ask to 'travel,\"\nthat is, to be guided by suggestion to places which she should clairvoyantly\nvisit. This was done accordingly, partly to oblige her, and partly as an.\namusement, and whenever her reports of her travels could be verified we are\ntold that they were found to be correct. But as Jane in her normal state\nshrank from all mention of these clairvoyant wanderings, very little was said\nabout them to anyone outside the family already mentioned. There was thus\nan entire absence of the motives which may often prompt to the simulation\nof clairvoyance ; and although the fragmentariness of these records is very\nunsatisfactory, it may be remarked, on the other hand, that it would be\ndifficult to imagine a case in which the faculty was less desired by its.\npossessor, or less wondered at by its observers. Even Dr. F.'s notes were\nonly preserved through the accident of their having been copied at the time\nby Mrs. Hargreaves (nee Procter) of Southport \" [who was doubtless specially\ninterested in them on account of what Jane said about Procter's Mill at\nWillington, a well-known haunted house in which Mrs. Hargreaves had lived\n(See Appendix.)].\nWhen Mr. Myers collected the evidence in 1884, Jane was still living,\nbut was seriously ill, and so anxious that her power should not be suspected\nby her neighbours that it was impossible to make further trial of it.\nIn the body of this paper I shall give only an account of Jane by\nMrs. T. Myers, which, though written from recollection after man)\"\nyears, is interesting as giving a general idea of what went on, and a\nportion of Dr. F.'s notes. As, however, the reader should have access,\nto all the evidence we have about this clairvoyant, the remainder will\nbe placed in the Appendix. It consists of (1) Dr. F.'s notes relating to\noccasions when almost all that the percipient is recorded to have said*\neither might have been read from the minds of those present or was\nunverifiable ; (2) an account by Mrs. Fraser, Mrs. T. Myers' sister, of\nher own recollections ; (3) an incident recalled by their brother, the\nRev. C. Green; (4) another fragment by Mrs. T. Myers ; (5) a corrobora\ntive letter from Jane's sister ; and (6) contemporaneous notes of a more\nrecent sitting taken by Mrs. Russell, a friend of Mrs. Fraser's, which,\nhowever, can hardly be said to record anything beyond the range of\npossible thought-transference from herself.\nMrs. Thomas Myers' Recollections of Jane.\n\"Twinstead Rectory, Sudbury, Suffolk. [1884.]\n\" This clairvoyante has been known by me since I was a child. I was-,\ntaken to see her by my sister and remember her first in a bed in the upper\nroom of a small house in Durham. She was a remarkably refined woman\nfor her rank in life, sweet and gentle looking, with delicately cut features\nand wavy dark hair. She was very religious and conscientious, and even\nwhen mesmerised and under the influence of others could never be induced\nto read letters or pry into things which she knew the person visited would\nwish to keep secret. On one occasion I remember taking her in the sleep,\nto see a young lady ; she said, ' She is writing to her lover.' ' AVhat is she\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 55\nsaying to him?' Indignant answer : ' We will not look ; would we like any\none to look over we's shoulder when we writes love letters 1 ' I was early\ntaught to give her the sleep, so to me there has never been anything astonish\ning in clairvoyance or thought-reading, therefore I never took notes of what\nwas a daily occurrence. This is to be regretted, as so much interesting\nmatter is forgotten. When under the influence of the sleep she is quite dis\ntinct from herself and calls her body ' we's girl,' and does not like her, com\nplaining that she troubles her and gives her pains in her side or face, nay,\nanywhere and everywhere, for all through her life she has been and still is a\ngreat sufferer. Out of the ' sleep ' she never murmurs against her lot, but\nhas a resigned spirit to God's wilr.\n'' In the sleep she is on an equality with the operator, and also feels\nthrough that person ; her own body possesses no sense of feeling. She dis\nlikes the touch of silk very much and hates cats in the room. Her dislike\nto black is great, and black people she cannot endure, and she will not\nrecognise them as ' men and brothers, ' not even when appealed to to regard\nthem in a Christian point of view. ' We do not like them, we will not look\nat them, ' and she shudders with disgust if, when taken to India or Africa,\nshe gets into a crowd or comes into contact with them ; for in the spirit she\nstillfeels in a body, and expects people to see her and resents being jostled\nin a crowd, or nearly run over by carriages and horses. Once, when taking\nher to see a friend, she called out, ' What a rude man, he has nearly run over\nwe with his prancing horses. ' ' Where are you V 'In the drive going up\nto his house.' 'But he cannot see you.' ' He ought to see we ; he might\nhave broken we's leg,' and immediately added, ' But he could mend it if he\nhad, he is a doctor ; he does not give nasty medicines, but little pills and\ntinctures.' She had never out of the sleep known this gentleman or any\nthing about Homoeopathy, and she was at this time in the'North of England;\nhe was in Clifton. I asked her his name ; she spelt on the doorplate of\nhis private house, ' Williams,' quite correctly, and described him and his\nhouse and family most correctly.\n\" She intensely dislikes death and will not willingly enter where anyone\nis dying or is dead. This was shown very strongly once when taken to see\nDr. Livingstone\u2014she found him in a tent, but would pay little attention to\nhim because a man lay dying in the corner. I rebuked her for her horror of\ndeath, but she would not be lectured into a proper frame of mind, and said,\nvery angrily, ' We do not like dying people. Why has that man come here\nto die ? he had better have stayed at home.' I said, ' Well, never mind him,\nlook at Dr. Livingstone. ' ' He is ill and troubled\u2014but look at that man\u2014\nthere\u2014he is dead. Give we we's coffee ' ! I have never heard of anyone\ndying in that year (1871) while with Dr. Livingstone, but if anyone reading\nthis has, it will be interesting to verify her statement. He was a white\nman.\n\" Whenever Jane wishes to come out of her sleep, she says, 'Give We\nwe's coffee.' When first given the sleep, she had a cup of coffee on waking,\nbut never afterwards. The habit, however, continues until this day, and the\nimaginary cup of coffee is taken\u2014let us hope with benefit. A young niece of\nmine mesmerised her, at her own request, when they were alone together,\nand not knowing how to do it or how to awaken her, my niece was nervous,\n\f56 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nand did not understand the request for waking. So Jane kept entreating,\n' Give we we's coffee ; give we we's coffee.' At last she thought she would\nask Jane to tell her how to wake her, which she did. We rather wondered\nat this, as in the sleep she is another person, and has no knowledge of what\nshe says or sees.\n\"She is not always to be depended upon in the matter of time. Jane\ncounts by 'suns, ' not days. We have often found her perfectly correct in time,\nas in the cases of the visit to Mrs. Fraser [Mrs. Myers' sister, who had often\nmesmerised Jane], when she told of my sister hitting her nose against a\nscreen, and also of the lady who took tea for her lunch in London, when\ngoing into the City on business, and the gentleman who listened to the old\nwhite-haired man singing in the streets of Durham.\n\"Jane frequently turns lazy in the sleep, and must not then be trusted\nto find out anything, as she will read the mind of the mesmeriser on the sub\nject. This can be in a great measure prevented, but not always, by the\noperator turning his or her thoughts into another line. But from this cause\nJane has often proved a failure. She is also very much influenced by the\npresence of believers or unbelievers. She does not see or hear anyone who\nis present unless the mesmeriser turns and looks at the person. In a very\nuncomfortable manner for polite operators, she reads the mind and thoughts\nof those she is called to look at, and inquires first, ' Is he one of we's ? ' and\nthen reviews the heart in a religious point of view. One day, when looking\nat a man (fortunately not in the room), she said, ' We do not like him, his\nheart is as black as his hat ! '\n\"She was once taken in the year 1845 to visit my cousins. She said the\neldest had measles, and then noticed a cradle with a baby in it, rocking\nrapidly without anyone near it. This was thought very strange by the\noperator, but on w'riting to tell the friends of the visit they said she was quite\ncorrect, as the baby used to rock himself with his elbows. In 1871 I took\nher [mentally] to a cousin's house in Clifton, sister of the 'Baby Willie,' and\nas she went into the house she read 'Salve' on the tiles before the glass\ndoor ; then entering the hall she exclaimed, ' Here is a gentleman. It is\n'' Baby Willie ! \" \"Baby Willie\" grown a big man. ' She had never seen him\nsince she saw him in that cradle, and her joy was great to see him again. I\nwas not aware he was in Clifton at that time, but he had gone for a few\ndays to see his sister. I found this out on writing to tell what she had said.\nShe then entered the dining-room and recognised ' Baby Willie's ' sister,\nMrs. J. D. Wills, and said, ' Miss Lillie is a matron now, so altered. May\nwe go upstairs and see her children ? ' I said, ' Yes. ' So up she went and\nentered the nursery. She looked round and then called out, ' Another Baby\nWillie ! ' and was so pleased with it, then described the other children and\nnurses, and gave them their names correctly. The under-nurse was highly\ncommended. The ' Baby Willie ' of the cradle was the W. Temple Bourne\nwhose ring she got returned to him (found in the old coat).\n\"Jane was taken by my sister, Miss Green, I being present, and a Miss\nA. A., a friend, to see her [Miss A. A.'s] great aunt, who was ill, but\nrefused to let a doctor examine her. Miss A. A.'s mother had gone to nurse\n-her at a town far away from where we were, and Jane knew nothing of any\nof the parties nor did we. She entered the house and immediately\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 57\nexclaimed, ' Oh, for shame ! Oh, for shame ! Two bottles and a cup ! Look\nin the closet : two bottles and a cup ! ! She fell downstairs and has broken\nher leg : she does not wish it known.' Miss A. at once wrote to her mother,\nwho looked in the cupboard and found two empty bottles and a cup ' The\ndoctor examined the leg, it was broken. No previous suspicion pointed to\nthis sad discovery.\"\nDr. F.'s Notes.\nThe following notes were taken by Dr. F. in the summer of 1863. He\ndoes not wish his name to be published, being unwilling to be troubled with\ncorrespondence on the subject ; but he vouches for the complete freedom\nfrom bias with which he made the following observations.\nExperiment I.\n\"I was directed to sit down in front of the clairvoyante. Whilst taking\neach thumb and finger in my opposite hand, I fixed my eyes steadfastly upon\nher. In about two minutes her head began to droop ; when my two hands\nwere above her head she raised it gradually up to the erect position. She\nmade some remark, and grasping her hands again, I commenced the experi\nment by saying, ' We are beside some railings, with trees in them, and\n' opposite is a house, which I wish you to enter.' I must here premise\nthat I had no expectation of her power, and intending to puzzle her at once,\nI thus refrained from giving her any description that might afford her the\nleast hint where I wished her to go, in case it was an imposition. She\nimmediately replied, ' Which door shall we enter ? ' The house I had selected\nis that inhabited by Mr. Stephens, Dockwray-square, from whom, I made no\ndoubt, I could afterwards obtain satisfactory information respecting the truth\nor untruth of the description that might be given. As his house alone in the\nwhole square has two doors upon the same place, I was surprised at the\nanswer, and remarked, ' We will go into the lower door.' ' Shall we go along\nthe passage then, ' she replied, ' and into this room 1 Who is this lady sitting\nthere ? ' I asked whether she was young or old. ' Not very young, and not\nvery old,' she returned ; ' but she is sitting there, and she is a mamma. '\n\" I requested her next to proceed further along the passage, when she\nimmediately said, ' What a smell ! what a smell ! This is a medicine house. '\nI told her to tell me what she saw. She replied that there were many bottles\nupon the shelves, a book on the table, a young man with a knife, taking\ndown bottles and mixing medicines, and a head in the room. I asked what\nthe head was like, when she answered by asserting that it was not a ' live\nhead, ' and had no brains in it. I at the time supposed that she meant a\nphrenological bust, but have been since informed by Mr. Stephens that\na skull was actually at that time upon the table of his surgery. I\ninquired if anyone else was in the room, when she described a man with a\nshaggy head of hair, whose name she spelt as Wilson. I have been unable\nto learn whether there was such a person there at the time, but one called\nWilkinson is remembered to have been present.\n' ' Thinking that she had guessed that this was my own house, and thus\nimagined the rest, I determined to detect her, by leading her to my own\nresidence. I therefore said : ' We will leave this place, pass round the rails,\nand opposite us is a house.' She directly replied : ' Is it the clean house 2 *\n\f58 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nThis remark was probably elicited by the house having been painted a day\nor two previously. Telling her that she was quite correct, I requested her\nto proceed. I said : ' Is there a brass plate on the door 1 ' She answered\n' Yes, ' and upon my desiring her to read the name upon it, she spelt the\nletters [of my name]. She asked, 'May we go in? ' and upon receiving per\nmission, seemed to enter a drawing-room, when she exclaimed, ' We like\nthis room, don't we? and here is our mother sitting upon a sofa. ' I inquired\nwhat her occupation was, when she described her as an old lady reading a\nbook, with spectacles on, and having previously placed some stockings in a\ndrawer in another room. I requested her to tell me the name of the book,\nbut she stated that she could not do so, on account of the print being so small,\nand that the lady had laid down the book and pushed up her spectacles. I\nasked her what she saw in a certain part of the room where I knew a very\ncurious, old-fashioned cabinet was placed, but could get no satisfactory reply.\nHer mind, by constant cross-questioning, seemed to be thrown off, and she\ncommenced talking about some ladies' work, which, I was afterwards\ninformed, she had formerly described as belonging to another room when in\nher mesmeric state.\n\" Although considerably puzzled to account for the accuracy with which\nshe had followed me, I was by no means convinced that she possessed the\npower of clairvoyance, but determined to give the subject a further examina\ntion. It was certainly curious that she should have so easily lit upon the\nhouse of Mr. Stephens, and described what was going on in it, but I imagined\nthat this might have arisen from the association in her mind of my profession\nwith the mixing of drugs, but it was still more strange that if it was an\nimposture she should have guessed the next place to be my own house, and\nshould be able to describe so very accurately what was going on.\n\" I should mention that upon my return home I found my mother still\nsitting in the room and in the place in which she had been described, and\nupon my asking what had been her employment she stated that she had been\nreading ' ,' but the print was so small that about the time I was con\nducting the experiment she laid it down from inability to continue her\nreading. She had placed the stockings in a drawer in the morning.\"\nIt may, perhaps, be thought that the facts described at this sitting,\nso far as they were unknown to Dr. F., were not sufficiently unusual to\nbe beyond guesswork, but, if so, the same objection certainly cannot be\nmade to Dr. F.'s next experiment.\nExperiment II.\n' ' Before commencing the sitting, I fixed to take her to a house, without\ncommunicating my intentions to any of the parties present. In the morning\nof the day I stated to a patient of my own, Mr. Eglinton, at present resid\ning in the village of Tynemouth, that I intended to visit him. He stated\nthat he would be present between 8 and 10 p.m. in a particular room, so that\nthere might be no difficulty in finding him. He was just recovering from a\nvery severe illness, and was so weak that he could scarcely walk. He was\nexceedingly thin from the effects of his complaint.\n\"After the usual state had been obtained, I said, 'We are standing\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 59\nheside a railway station, now we pass along a road, and in front of us see a\nhouse with a laburnum tree in front of it.' She directly replied, 'Is it the\nred house with a brass knocker 1 ' I said, 'No, it has an iron knocker.' I\nhave since looked, however, and find that the door has an old-fashioned\nbrass handle in the shape of a knocker. She then asked, ' Shall we go up the\nsteps ? Shall we go along this passage, and up these stairs ? Is this a window\non the stair head?' I said, ' You are quite right, and now I want you to\nlook into the room upon the left hand side.' She replied, 'Oh, yes, in the\nbedroom. There is no one in this room ; there is a bed in it, but there is.\nno person in it.' I was not aware that a bedroom was in the place I\nmentioned, but upon inquiry next day I found she was correct. I told her\n.she must look into.the next room, and she would see a sofa. She answered,\n' But there is here a little gallery. Now I am in the room, and see a lady\nwith black hair lying upon the sofa. ' I attempted to puzzle her about the\ncolour of her hair, and feeling sure it was Mr. Eglinton who was lying;\nthere, I sharply cross-questioned her, but still she persisted in her story.\nThe questioning, however, seemed to distract her mind, and she commenced\ntalking about a lady at Whickham, until I at last recalled her to the room at\nTynemouth, by asking whether there was not a gentleman in the room.\n' No,' she said ; ' we can see no gentleman there. '\n'.' After a little she described the door opening, and asked, with a tone of\ngreat surprise, ' Is that a gentleman ? ' I replied, ' Yes ; is he thin or\nfat ? ' ' Very fat, ' she answered ; ' but has he a cork leg ? ' I assured her\nthat he had no cork leg, and tried to puzzle her again about him. She,\nhowever, assured me that he was very fat and had a great corporation, and\nasked me whether I did not think such a fat man must eat and drink a great\ndeal to get such a corporation as that. She also described him as sitting by,\nthe table with papers beside him, and a glass of brandy and water. ' Is it\nnot wine ?' I asked. ' No, she said, ' it's brandy.' ' Is it not whisky or\nrum ? ' ' No, it is brandy, ' was the answer ; ' and now, ' she continued,\n' the lady is going to get her supper, but the fat gentleman does not take\nanj-.' I requested her to tell me the colour of his hair, but she only .\nanswered that the lady's hair was dark. I then inquired if he had any brains\nin his head, but she seemed altogether puzzled about him, and said she\ncould not see any. I then asked her if she could see his name upon any of\nthe letters lying about. She replied, ' Yes ' ; and upon my saying that the\nname began with E, she spelt each letter of the name ' Eglinton.'\n'' I was so convinced that I had at last detected her in a complete mistake\nthat I arose, and declined proceeding further in the matter, stating that,\nalthough her description of the house and the name of the person were\ncorrect, in everything connected with the gentleman she had guessed the\nopposite from the truth.\n\" On the following morning Mr. E. asked me the result of the experiment,\nand after having related it to him, he gave me the following account :\u2014He\nhad found himself unable to sit up to so late an hour, but wishful fairly to\ntest the powers of the clairvoyante, he had ordered his clothes to be stuffed\ninto the form of a figure, and to make the contrast more striking to his\nnatural appearance, had an extra pillow pushed into the clothes so as to form\na 'corporation.' This figure had been placed near the table, in a sitting\n\fCO Mrs. H. Sidgioick,\nposition, and a glass of brandy and water and the newspapers placed beside\nit. The name, he further added, was spelt correctly, though up to that\ntime I had been in the habit of writing it ' Eglington,' instead of as spelt\nby the clairvoyante, 'Eglinton.'\"\nExperiment V.\n\"July 20th, 1853. \u2014Sitting commenced at quarter to nine, finished 20\nminutes to 10.\n\" She was very dull this evening, and during the experiment again com\nplained of the girl [meaning herself] troubling her and that she would not\nlove the girl. She had been engaged the whole afternoon and evening\n.nursing her child, who is weak and irritable from a late attack of measles.\nMr. Owen present. In about two minutes she fell into the state. I had\n.previously requested Mr. Gibb to watch, which he did between half-past 8\n.and 10, and agreed to bring her to the College of Medicine in Street.\nI therefore said to her, ' We are near a railway station, let us go along the\nroad and turn down, and opposite to us is a door. ' ' May we go in here 1 '\n\u00abhe asked. On entering, she described a gentleman as rather stoutly built,\nof middle size, asking if he was a gentleman who was sitting in a room, which\nwas not an ordinary room, but was a place for people to come to, and which\n\u00abhe said was like an office ; he was sitting doing nothing. She asked, ' Was\nhe expecting me to come ? ' and ' What did he want with me ? ' She did not\n.seem to observe anyone else, but was by no means clear. Continually she\nexclaimed, ' What a strange place, ' ' What a strange place this is, ' ' What do\nthey do here ?' She 'never were in a place like this before.' I requested\nher to proceed upstairs, when she said they were very queer stairs, and\n,asked what those were sticking in the wall. I replied that they were rafters.\nShe asked why they placed them there. I answered to support the roof.\nShe thought it must be a dangerous place if the roof required support. She\ndescribed a room at the top of the stairs to which she said many people came,\nbut could not imagine its use. As this was evidently the dissecting room or\nlecture room, the one opening into the other, and as at this present time the\ndissecting room is empty, I asked her to go into the further room of the two,\nwhen she repeated her observations about it being a place to speak in. I\ntold her to look and see what was done in the room, when she replied that\nshe saw the gentleman speaking to a number of persons.\n\" At this stage I was called out, and found that Mr. P., a gentleman\nbelonging to the Society of Friends, wished me to accompany him to see his\nson, who had returned from Carlisle after taking chloroform during the\nextraction of some teeth. I requested a lady to supply my place whilst I\nwent with Mr. P. Jane complained bitterly of my leaving her, and insisted\n,on following me. She found me, she said, with a gentleman with a broad-\nbrimmed hat, who was remarking 'thou knowest it.' She next described\nthe young gentleman ill from the effects of some stuff which had been given\nto him by a person along a railway, a long way off, which had done him\nharm, and that the person fancied himself a great man, but was not one, and\nshould not meddle with such things. She saw the room and one lady stand\ning over him, and recognised two other young ladies she had before seen,\n.asking how she had got here. This was all correct, excepting that I do not\nremember Mr. P. using the expression above named.\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 61\n\" She was requested to continue her description of the building as soon*\nas I returned. I again took hold of her hands, and she then described a\nlecture about cutting off legs and arms, and such like, and also a room next\nit with bones and skeletons in it, and things, the names of which she could\nnot catch, in glass cases for the gentlemen to look at and think about.\"\nThe important part of Experiment V. in relation to clairvoyance\nis Jane's mental following of Dr. P., when he went with Mr. P., since\nthe account of the College of Medicine hardly seems to have included\ndetails unknown to or unguessed by Dr. F. The same kind of know\nledge of what Dr. F. is doing at a distance is shown in Experiments\nVII. and VIII., which follow, but in the latter he had a definite\nintention that she should know it.\nExperiment VII.\nJuly 26<\/i.\n\" I have classed under this head the results obtained at two sittings, but\nI was not present myself, the clairvoyante being mesmerised by a lady (Mrs.\nH. E. Fraser), who had been previously in the habit of doing it. I was\nvisiting a lady professionally who was suffering from headache, and mentioned\nto her the subject of clairvoyance, stating that I would ' pay her a visit in\nspirit. ' I met Mrs. Fraser, who had been mesmerising the clairvoyante that\nmorning, who said, ' Who is this lady to whom you have promised a visit 1 '\nShe then stated that whilst in the mesmeric state Jane was requested to find\nme, which she did, stating that I was in a room with a lady, to whom I was\naddressing the words I have before used, and adding, ' But we will pay her a\nvisit in spirit.' When she was next under the influence of Mrs. Fraser, she\nrecurred to this, and described the room in which the lady with whom she had\nfound me was sitting, stated that it had a beautiful sea view, was very\nhandsomely furnished, and that in the corner was lying a thing to look\nthrough, also some ladies' work. In all this she was perfectly correct,\nalthough Mrs. Fraser was not in the slightest degree acquainted with the\nhouse or the lady.\"\nExperiment VIII.\nJuly 20th, 9 p.m.\n[Mrs. Fraser, who was present, states that the account here given by\nJane was accurate, though by an accident this is not expressly stated.]\n\" Mrs. B. [i.e., Mrs. Fraser] put Jane into the mesmeric sleep, and then\nbid her find Dr. F., who had previously gone into the next room, Mrs. B.\nnot knowing how he intended to employ himself there. Jane was a few\nminutes before she could say anything about him, and then exclaimed, ' Why\nhe is putting the things in an uproar ? His mamma don't like him to put\nthings in an uproar. There is a lady with him. Is it our own we ? He does\nnot make a good lady ; he is a gentleman lady ; our lady gone now. He is\nbusy with his toilet. Does he think himself smart ? He is just like a fool, like\na Punch. Will mamma we whip him for turning things upside down ? Does\nshe like him to amuse himself ? Is it we's own we, with a white coat on ?\nWhat sort of a coat ? The cat lady put his coat on the wrong way to make\nhis face look behind. She now put a pipe in his mouth\u2014just like Punch\u2014\n\f62 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\n.see what is on the table\u2014a pipe, and the cat\u2014we don't like the cat, and a\nlamp on the table. Is that a cloak he has got on t How monstrous ugly he\nis, too ugly for a lady, we think. How he is turning the room upside down,\nlooking wrong way into the glass. Does he like to amuse himself with cats ?\nHe likes live cats and dead cats, and live dogs and dead dogs, and arms and\nlegs to cut off, and bones and skulls, and all them sort of things.'\n\"As Dr. F. then left the room, Mrs. B. tried her with a letter which Miss\nC, who was sitting near, had in her pocket, Mrs. B. not knowing the writer.\nJane was bid to find the writer. She said she must go a long way on the\nrailway, and found him at Carlisle, with a wide hat on, and she said he was\na nice gentleman, and had a good mind, but she said he would not believe\n.about the sleep. Mrs. B. asked what would make him believe it. Jane said\nlie wished to see miracles, but if he did see them he would not believe. Then\nshe said, ' We so very indignant at him not believing. ' She then got so\nexcited and angry, saying she would not look any more at him. Mrs. B. then\ntried her with another letter, the contents of which were known to Mrs. B.,\nbut not to Jane. She said the letter was from a young lady, at the large\ntown ; that it was about we's sleep, and about the gentleman whom she had\nbeen to search for in the cold country (Lieutenant Pym), but that the writer\nwould not believe in the sleep, so she would not look any more at him.\"\nIn Jane's case we have an advance on the Peterhead one, in respect\nof the difficulty of applying a telepathic explanation, because she seems to\nhave been able to perceive the surroundings of distant people who were\nunknown to her, though known to her hypnotiser or others in the\nroom. In the most marked case of this, however, among those recorded\nat the time, Mr. Eglinton, though unacquainted with Jane, was aware\nthat an attempt to see him clairvoyantly was to be made at that hour,\nand was not only interested in it, but made somewhat elaborate\narrangements in view of it, so that we may almost regard him as a\nconscious \" Agent.\"\nWe may take next a group of four cases observed by Mr. A. W.\nDobbie, of Gawler-place, Adelaide, South Australia (an Associate of the\nS.P.R.), with various hypnotic subjects of his own. Mr. Dobbie has\npractised hypnotism for the last ten or twelve years, and has found\nhimself to be a very successful operator. He has hypnotised, he tells\nus, more than 500 persons, chiefly with the view of alleviating suffer\ning, and has come across a few who seem to be capable of clairvoyance.\nIt will be convenient to take the four cases together, not because they\nresemble each other, but because they all are the result of Mr. Dobbie's\nexperiments.\nThe first is a comparatively slight case of the type of Dr. F.'s\nExperiment VIII. with Jane, and may easily be explained telepathi-\ncally. We extract the account from Mr. Dobbie's notebook, which,\nwhen he was in England in 1889; he allowed us to .study.\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. C3\n(M. 19.)- November 28th, 1884. \"This evening, whilst at Mrs. E.'s,\nengaged mesmerising 6 or 7 persons for clairvoyant purposes, Lilly Thomas\ncame to me from the Rev. H. T. B.'s to be cured of toothache. Having\nmesmerised her either once or twice before, I knew she was an easy subject,\nso I put her into the conscious impressible state immediately, and cured her\ntoothache.\n\" I then asked her to go (clairvoyantly) to the breakfast-room of the Rev.\nH. T. B., and tell me who was there. In about a minute she said, \"Mrs.\nW. B. is sitting in the rocking-chair. ' ' Who else is in the room 1 ' ' The\ntwo little girls.' ' What are they doing ? ' 'Sewing.' ' Can you hear them\ntalking?' 'Yes, Mrs. W. B. has just told them they mustn't do some\nthing. '\n\" I afterwards (the same evening) visited Mrs. B., and found that my\nclairvoyant had told me quite correctly. I then asked Mrs. W. B. to bring\nher into the room, and I would again try her powers. I found her tooth\nache had not given her any more trouble. I again, in a few seconds, mes\nmerised her, and went into another room and placed a rocking-chair and\ncruet-stand on the table, and coming back, I said, ' Now, I want you to tell\nme what is on the table in the breakfast-room.' In a few minutes she said,\nin evident astonishment, ' The rocking-chair is on the table. ' ' Anything\nelse?' I inquired. 'Yes, the cruet-stand.'\n\"With a view of proving whether it was simply thought-reading or\ngenuine clairvoyance, I asked Mrs. B. to go into the room and do something\nnnd remain there. I then said to L. T., ' Is anyone in the room ? ' ' Yes,\nMrs. W. B.' ' What is she doing?' 'Sitting in the small rocking-chair,\nlaughing.' I hurried to the room, and found things exactly as described.\n'' It being now 10 o'clock, and I four miles from home, I was reluctantly\ncompelled to hurry away without further experiments.\"\nThe first of these trials may have been an instance of successful\nguessing, as Lilly Thomas was, we presume, familiar with the ways of\nthe household, and we have no reason to think that anything unusual\nwas going on. The second, again, may have been, as Mr. Dobbie sug\ngests, thought-transference from himself. It is the third which appears\nto be a genuine instance of clairvoyance, telepathic or other.\nIn the case to be next given it seems likely that the close relation\n,of father and daughter may have facilitated the clairvoyance. We\nagain extract the account from Mr. Dobbie's notebook.\n\"June Kith, 1884.\n(M. 20.) \" Up to the present time this has been the most interesting\n,case I have had.\n' ' In the first instance I mesmerised [Miss ] as an experiment whilst\nI was endeavouring to mesmerise several others. I found her an easy sub\nject. I afterwards had occasion to mesmerise her with a view of relieving her\nfrom rheumatic pains. I always succeeded in removing her pains and curing\nher sore throat, whether I put her into the mesmeric sleep or not. As with\nseveral other patients, I can entirely remove all sensation of feeling from her\n\f64 Mrs. H. SidgvAclc,\nlimbs, so that she can be severely pricked with a needle without experiencing\nthe slightest inconvenience. About the fifth time I mesmerised her it sud\ndenly occurred to me to test her clairvoyant powers, and I was delighted to\nfind that she developed this wonderful faculty.\n\" The following is a verbatim account of the second time I tested her\npowers in this respect, April 12th, 1884. There were four persons present\nduring the seance. One of the company wrote down the replies as they were\nspoken.\n* * * * *\n' ' Her father was at the time over 50 miles away, but we did not know\nexactly where, so I questioned her as follows : ' Can you find your father at\nthe present moment 1 ' At first she replied that she could not see him, but\nin a minute or two she said, ' Oh yes, now I can see him, Mr. Dobbie. '\n' Where is he 1 ' ' Sitting at a large table in a large room, and there are a\nlot of people going in and out.' ' What is he doing ? ' ' Writing a letter,\nand there is a book in front of him.' 'Who is he writing to V 'To the*\nnewspaper.' Here she paused and laughingly said, 'Well, I declare, he is.\nwriting to the A. B.' [naming a newspaper]. 'You said there was a book\nthere. Can you tell me what book it is 1 ' 'It has gilt letters on it.' ' Can\nyou read them, or tell me the name of the author?' She read, or pronounced\nslowly, ' W. L. W.' [giving the full surname of the author]. She answered\nseveral minor questions re the furniture in the room, and I then said to her,\n' Is it any effort or trouble to you to travel in this way 1 ' ' Yes, a little ; I\nhave to think.'\n\"I now stood behind her, holding a half-crown in my hand, and asked\nher if she could tell me what I had in my hand, to which she replied, ' It is.\na shilling. ' It seemed as though she could see what was happening miles\naway easier than she could see what was going on in the room.\n\" Her father returned home nearly a week afterwards and was perfectly\nastounded when told by his wife and family what he had been doing on that\nparticular evening, and although previous to that date he was a thorough\nsceptic as to clairvoyance, he frankly admitted that my clairvoyant was\nperfectly correct in every particular. He also informed us that the book\nreferred to was a new one which he had purchased after he had left his;\nhome, so that there was no possibility of his daughter guessing that he had\nthe book before him. I may add that the letter in due course appeared in\nthe paper ; and I saw and handled the book.\"\nMr. Dobbie was anxious to obtain for us the corroborative testi\nmony of the family in this case, but they were averse to giving any\nassistance in the investigation.\nThe next case was sent to us by Mr. Dobbie by letter in July,.\n1886, and he tells us that the notes are a copy of the notes he \"wrote\ndown the moment the words were uttered.\"\n\"Jidy 4th, 1886.\n(M. 6.) \"Striking case of clairvoyance, which occurred May 28th, 1886,,\nin the presence of the Hon. Dr. Campbell, M.L.C., Hon. David Murray,\nM.L.C., and Chief Secretary of South Australia, Mr. Lyall, and Mr-\nFleming, solicitor :\u2014\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 65\n\"The circumstances are briefly as follows, viz. : Dr. Campbell, being\npresent at one of my usual clairvoyant evenings, handed me a gold sleeve-\nlink, at the same time telling me that he had lost the fellow one to it, but\nhad no idea as to what had become of it ; he asked me to give the remain\ning one to one of my clairvoyants and see if they could find the missing one.\nI should state that neither of the clairvoyants had ever seen either of the\nrooms they referred to, nor did they know the names of the children, or\nanything in connection with this case, so that it is either a case of genuine\nclairvoyance, or else a most remarkable case of thought-reading.\n\" I first handed the sleeve-link to the younger of the two sisters [Misses\nEliza and Martha Dixon], who is not so lucid as her sister (I was giving the\nelder one a rest, as she had been hard at work, clairvoyantly, for the past\nhour).\n\" Miss Martha began by first accurately describing Dr. Campbell's\nfeatures, then spoke of a little fair-haired boy who had a stud, or sleeve-\nlink, in his hand, also of a lady calling him ' Neil ' ; then said that this\nlittle boy had taken the link into a place like a nursery where there were\nsome toys, especially a large toy elephant, and that he had dropped the link '\ninto this elephant through a hole which had been torn or knocked in the\nbreast ; also that he had taken it out again, and gave two or three other\ninteresting particulars. We were reluctantly compelled to postpone further\ninvestigation until two or three evenings afterwards.\n' ' On the next occasion (in the interval, however, the missing sleeve-link\nhad been found, but left untouched), I again placed the link in her hand\nand the previous particulars were at once reproduced ; but as she seemed to\nbe getting on very slowly, it occurred to Dr. Campbell to suggest placing his\nhand on that of the clairvoyant, so I placed him en rapport and allowed him\nto do so, he simply touching the back of her hand with the points of his\nfingers. As she still seemed to have great difficulty (she is always much\nslower than her sister) in proceeding, it suddenly occurred to me that it\nwould be an interesting experiment to place Miss Eliza Dixon en rapport\nwith Miss Martha, so I simply joined their disengaged hands, and Miss\nEliza immediately commenced as follows, viz. :\u2014\n\"'I'm in a house, upstairs, I was in a bathroom, then I went into\nanother room nearly opposite, there is a large mirror just inside the\ndoor on the left hand, there is a double-sized dressing-table with drawers\ndown each side of it, the sleeve-link is in the corner of the drawer\nnearest the door. When they found it they left it there. I know why they\nleft it there, it was because they wanted to see if we would find it. I can\nsee a nice easy chair there, it is an old one, I would like it when I am put to\nsleep, because it is nice and low. The bed has curtains, they are a sort of\nbrownish net and have a fringe of darker brown. The wall paper is of a\nlight blue colour. There is a cane lounge there and a pretty Japanese\nscreen behind it, the screen folds up. There is a portrait of an old gentle\nman over the mantelpiece, he is dead, I knew him when he was alive, his\nname is the same as the gentleman who acts as Governor when the Governor\nis absent from the colony,1 I will tell you his name directly\u2014it is the Rev.\n1 Chief Justice Way is the gentleman who acts as Deputy for his Excellency when,\nabsent from the colony.\u2014A. W. D.\nF\n\fMrs. H. Sidgwick.\nMr. Way. It was a little boy who put the sleeve-link in that drawer, he is\nvery fair, his hair is almost white, he is a pretty little boy, he has blue eyes\nand about three years old. The link had been left on that table, the little\nboy was in the nursery, and he went into the bedroom after the gentle\nman had left. I can see who the gentleman is, it is Dr. Campbell. Doesn't\nthat little boy look a young Turk, the link is quite a handful for his little\nhand, he is running about with it very pleased ; but he doesn't seem to\nknow what to do with it. (A)\n[Dr. Campbell was not present from this point. ]\n' ' 'Now I can hear someone calling up the stairs, a lady is calling two names,\nColin is one and Neil is the other, the other boy is about five years old and\nis darker than the other. The eldest, Colin, is going downstairs now, he is\ngone into what looks like a dining-room, the lady says, \" Where is Neil ? \"\n\" Upstairs, ma.\" \"Go and tell him to come down at once.\" The little fair-\nhaired boy had put the link down ; but when he heard his brother coming\nup, he picked it up again. Colin says\u2014\"Neil, you are to come down at\nonce.\" \"I won't,\" says Neil. \"You're a goose,\" replies Colin, and he turned\nand went down without Neil. What a young monkey ! now he has gone\ninto the nursery and put the link into a large toy elephant, he put it through\na hole in front, which is broken. He has gone downstairs now, I suppose he\nthinks it is safe there.\n' ' ' Now that gentleman has come into the room again and he wants that\nlink ; he is looking all about for it, he thinks it might be knocked down :\nthe lady is there now too, and they are both looking for it. The lady says\u2014\n\" Are you sure you put it there ?\" The gentleman says, \" Yes.\"\n\" ' Now it seems like next day, the servant is turning the carpet up and\nlooking all about for it ; but can't find it.\n' ' ' The gentleman is asking that young Turk if he has seen it, he knows\nthat he is fond of pretty things. The little boy says, \" No.\" He seems to\nthink it is fine fun to serve his father like that.\n\" ' Now it seems to be another day and the little boy is in the nursery\nagain, he has taken the link out of the elephant, now he has dropped it into\nthat drawer, that is all I have to tell you about it, I told you the rest\nbefore .' \"\n\"July 15th, 1886.\n\" Since writing the above pages I have handed them to Dr. Campbell\nfor perusal, so that he might check the account and ratify it or otherwise,\nand after going carefully through it he has returned it to me, accompanied\nby a complete ratification in writing, which I herewith enclose.\n\"A. W. Dobbie.\"\nMemo, by Dr. Campbell.\n\"Adelaide, JvhjQth, 1886.\n\"At the point (A) the seance was discontinued till the next sitting, when\nI was absent. The conversation reported as passing between the children is\ncorrect. The description of the room is accurate in every point. The\nportrait is that of the late Rev. James Way. The description of the children\nand their names are true. The fact that the link was discovered in the\ndrawer, in the interval between one sitting and the final one, and that the\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 67\nlink was left there, pending the discovery of it by the clairvoyant, is also\ncorrect, as this was my suggestion to Mrs. Campbell when she showed it to\nme in the corner of the drawer. In fact, every circumstance reported is\nabsolutely correct. I know, further, that neither of the clairvoyants has\never been inside of my door. My children are utterly unknown to them,\neither in appearance or by name. I may say also that they had no know\nledge of my intention to place the link in their possession, or even of my\npresence at the seance, as they were both on each occasion in the mesmeric\nsleep when I arrived.\u2014Allan Campbell.\"\nIn a later letter, dated December 16th, 1887, Dr. Campbell writes :\u2014\n\"Dear Mr. Dobbie,\u2014Your London correspondent asks if I had any\nknowledge of the conversation that the clairvoyant stated had passed\nbetween the children. I had no knowledge whatever of this conversation,\nnor the circumstances attending it, until she repeated it. It was subsequently\nconfirmed to me in part by Mrs. Campbell, such part as she herself is\nreported to have taken in the tableau.\n\"With respect to the large toy elephant, I certainly knew of its\nexistence, but was not thinking of it at the time the clairvoyant was speak\ning. I did not know even by suspicion that the elephant was so mutilated\nas to have a large opening in its chest, and on coming home had to\nexamine the toy to see whether the statement was correct. I need hardly\nsay that it was absolutely correct.\u2014I am, yours sincerely,\n\"Allan Campbell.\"\nMr. Dobbie tells us that \"neither he nor his clairvoyants had any\nopportunity, directly or indirectly, of knowing any of the particulars\nbrought out by the clairvoyant.\" He afterwards saw the room described,\nand says \" the description is simply perfect in every particular.\"\nThere are several noteworthy points about this rather complicated\ncase. In the first place it will be noticed that the greater part of the\ninformation given by the clairvoyants might have been obtained by\nthought-transference from the mind of Dr. Campbell, who was present\nmost of the time. It would then, at any rate, be a very remarkable\nand interesting case of thought-transference, but so far it would not be\nclairvoyance as we have defined it. Further, a large proportion of the\n.statements made\u2014all about the little boy taking, hiding, and restoring\nthe sleeve link\u2014are unverifiable. But there is one important point\nunknown to Dr. Campbell (so far as his conscious memory, at least, was\nconcerned) and afterwards proved true, and that is the existence of the\nhole in the front of the toy elephant. The introduction of this peculiar\nfact\u2014which if learnt by mind-reading must, it would seem, have been\nlearnt from the child, or some other person quite unknown to the per\ncipient\u2014is so remarkable that it makes it seem more probable than\nnot that the hiding of the sleeve link there was also a fact. If so, it is\ngreatly to be regretted in the interests of science that the child ever\ntook it out again ! I attach less importance, as evidence of clairvoy\nf 2\n\f68 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nance, to the knowledge of the conversation of the children than to that\nof the hole in the toy elephant, because it is more the kind of thing\nthat might be guessed.\nAnother noticeable point in this case is that so far as the clair\nvoyants' remarks relate to the actions of those concerned\u2014the children,\nDr. and Mrs. Campbell, the servant\u2014the descriptions are not of the\npresent but of the past. A knowledge of past actions was similarly\nshown by \"Jane \" when she said that Dr. F.'s mother had been putting\nstockings away in a drawer (see p. 58), and we shall meet with it again\nin the case to be next given. This clairvoyant knowledge of the past\nseems to me, if true, to be a fact of great importance, and to afford a\nstrong argument against any kind of direct perception by the clair\nvoyant.\nIn the case just discussed the clairvoyant seems cognisant of the\nsurroundings of persons with whom she is herself entirely unacquainted,\nbut who were known to someone present with her and possibly en\nrapport with her. The next case takes us a step further, for the people\nwhose surroundings were seen were absolutely unknown to all present.\nUnfortunately, the case is less well evidenced than the last, because Mr.\nDobbie, contrary to his usual practice, omitted to make notes at the\ntime. He says :\u2014\n(M. 11.) \" I considered that it would be so very improbable that my\nclairvoyant would be able to do anything with so little clue, that I did not\nthink it worth while writing a single note, in fact, I should not have wasted\ntime over the experiment but for fear of being thought disobliging.\"\nThe account we print was sent to us by Mr. Dobbie in a letter contain\ning other narratives as well, and which was begun in January and finished\nin March, 1886. The part relating to this incident is dated March 7th, and\nit appears from Mr. Dobbie's notebook that the incident itself occurred early\nin January, 1886.\n\"One evening, whilst I was busy with several of my clairvoyants, Mr.\nAdamson, J.P. (one of the leading citizens of Adelaide), called, in company\nwith his daughter, and handing me two or three trinkets which had been\nsuspended to her watch-chain, simply remarked, 'We have lost something.\nWill you kindly see if your clairvoyant can help us in the matter?'\n'' My clairvoyants all being asleep, I quietly placed the trinkets in the\nhand of the one called Miss E. Dixon, without remark. In a moment or\ntwo she proceeded to give an accurate description of the young lady who\nowned the trinkets. I then said, ' Never mind the young lady, something is\nlost ; try and find it. '\n\"In a few moments she commenced to describe a gold pencil-case which\nshe saw ' lying on the road in one of the suburbs, not in the city, it is not\nthere now, it is in a comfortable-looking one-storey house, with a garden\nand iron railings in front and a two-storey building opposite. ' She then\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 69\ndescribed the gentleman who had possession of the pencil-case, whom she saw\nwith his wife, and also quoted a remark he made, ' We will lay it aside and\nsee if anyone claims it, ' and stated that it was placed ' in a small box. ' My\n,clairvoyant seemed unable to give me the locality of this gentleman and his\nhouse ; however, in reply to an advertisement next day or day after, a\ngentleman answering the description given by my clairvoyant brought the\nlost pencil-case to Mr. Adamson, who, naturally enough, was so astounded\nat the correct description of a person none of us had ever seen or known, that\nhe took the tram and visited the neighbourhood and house in which the\ngentleman resided, and to his astonishment he found that the description\nwas exact, in fact it was the only house in the neighbourhood having iron\nrailings, also that there actually was a two-storey house opposite, which was\nalso the only one in the neighbourhood. Mr. Adamson, on questioning the\ngentleman, found that the pencil-case was found on the road as described ;\nalso that it had been placed in the small box and the remark made re wait\ning to ' see if it would be claimed ' by the gentleman.\n\"To still further test the genuineness of the clairvoyance, I arranged\n(quite unknown to my clairvoyant, of course) to have the said gentleman\npresent with about twelve other persons,who all entered the room after I had\nput my clairvoyant to sleep, and, on placing the trinkets and pencil-case in her\nhands again, she immediately found herself at the same house again and saw\nthe same gentleman. I then instructed her to remember (my subjects\nnever remember anything when they wake up unless I instruct them to do\nso) the features of this gentleman, so that if ever she should meet him in\nthe future she would recognise him. I then woke her up, and to the\nastonishment and delight of all present she at once voluntarily recognised\nthe gentleman as the one she had seen when mesmerised. Of course, you\nwill see at once that the fact of the clairvoyant recognising the gentleman\nis not of itself of much scientific value, because the fact that I by this time\nknew the features of the gentleman makes it possible to bring that part\nof the experiment under the category of thought-transference, but taken\nin conjunction with the previous parts, I think the idea of thought-\ntransference may be discarded.\n\"It is only fair to mention that Mr. Adamson, J.P., is universally\nacknowledged by his very large circle of acquaintances to be one of the most\ncommon-sense and shrewdest men in South'Australia, and occupies leading\npositions on many of the public committees and boards of our city.\n\"A. W. Dobbie.\"\nThe following statement, Mr. Dobbie tells us, was handed to him by Mr.\nAdamson on March 8th, 1886 :\u2014\n\" Dear Sir,\u2014I have looked through that portion of your letter on pages\n7 and 8, and agree with most of what is there. You had best, however,\nleave out 'one of the leading citizens,' &c. The following is my version of\nthe affair :\u2014\n'' Passing your house one evening, in company with a daughter, who had\nlost a trinket off her watch-chain a week or so previous, and who lamented\nits loss, not on account of intrinsic value, but as an old keepsake, I said to\nher : ' Come in and see if Mr. Dobbie can find it for you.' We told you our\n\f70 Mrs. H. Sidgwiclc.\ntrouble, that something was lost off a watch-chain, and asked your assistance\nin its recovery, promising to bring you next evening the remaining trinkets,\nconsisting of three lockets. You said it was a difficult case, but you would\ntry.\n\" You had three clairvoyants asleep when we entered your room ;\nshortly afterwards you placed the trinkets in the hand of one of them, a\nfemale. Soon after which she began a fair description of my daughter ;\nthis you stopped, informing her that something was lost which we wanted\nto find. She was silent for a minute or two, and then said : ' I think I\nsee it now. It was in the dust, and a man has found it.' The question was\nput : ' What is it ? ' She answered : ' A ring ; there is something on it ; it\nis not a key, oh ! it's a pencil-case ; it's bright and shining. ' She was then\nasked to follow the man home. This caused a long silence. At length she\nsaid : ' I am there now ; he is showing it to a woman. I think it is his wife.\nHe is putting it in a box, and saying, '' We will leave it there and see what\ncomes of it.\" ' She then said more than once, 'They would give it up if they\nknew who it belonged to, they do not want to keep it ; oh, 1 wish I could\ntake it away, they seem honest people.' She then, in answer to questions\nput, described the house in which the people lived, and the neighbourhood\nexactly, but could not give the locality, as she had never been there\nbefore\u2014described the house as old and comfortable, like within a garden,\na wrought-iron railing in front ; no church could be seen from the gate, but\na large two-storey building opposite. She described the man accurately\"\nwho had the pencil-case, and advised advertising for its recovery, as she\nwas sure of its return if it was known who was the owner.\n\" I may here say that this had already been done, and that next day,\nafter the interview, the article was returned to my son at his office in town ;\nthe man who brought it left his address, and I have since visited his house\nand interviewed him, and he was in no small degree astonished when he\nfound that we had known so much about him and his proceedings. I may\nstate that I was almost a total unbeliever in clairvoyance until the above\nincident, but am now compelled to change my opinion, and acknowledge that\nthere is something in it I cannot understand.\n\"Since the above occasion you have in my presence traced the matter\nfurther by the clairvoyant following the finder to Adelaide, and seeing him\ngo upstairs to my son's office and there give up the pencil-case. Of this, as of\nall former knowledge of the article in question, she must have been in total\nignorance. \"A. Adamson.\"\nThe advertisement about the lost trinket in this case appears to have\nbeen issued before the clairvoyant's statements were made, and it is\ntherefore conceivable that it may have been consciously or unconsciously\nseen by her ; but this could not have helped her, in any normal way,\nto a knowledge of the finder and his actions and surroundings, which,\nthough not very detailed as reported to us, seems to have been too much\nso to have been the result of chance.\nThe percipients in this case and the last are two young ladies, sisters,\nwho have a large school for young children. They have very frequently\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance, 11\nassisted Mr. Dobbie in his experiments, but have no pecuniary interest\nin them whatever. It may be of interest to know Mr. Dobbie's method\nof operating. He writes :\u2014\n\" My usual method of operating is to put them to sleep by a few passes,\nand then quietly to wait until they tell me they are ready. I then silently slip\nthe article in question into their hands, and in from two to five minutes they\nbegin to speak in a perfectly natural way, and I write down what they say.\nIn most cases when the specimen is the hair of a person who is ill, the\nMisses Dixon will simply hold the hair in their hands for an interval of from\nfive to fifteen minutes, and then sit up to the table, opsn their eyes (though\nstill asleep) and write out a diagnosis of the case and prescribe remedies.\nIn most cases they correctly describe the ailments, although in some cases\n(even when I am fully aware of the circumstances) they are entirely wrong.\nSome of the cures have been very remarkable ; but I am not prepared to\npositively assert whether the cures were effected by the remedies, or were the\nresult of faith, or, in other words, the action of the mind on the body. \"\nMr. Dobbie obtained many instances of apparent clairvoyance\nwith the Misses Dixon, and with a Mr. Williams\u2014a young man of 24.\nBut, in the majority of cases, the result was unverifiable or might be\ndue to thought-transference from those present. They would describe,\noften with great vividness and power of imagination, some scenes\nsupposed to be connected with the past history of an object placed in\ntheir hands, but it is difficult to say whether the historical or other know\nledge displayed transcended what the percipient might have possessed\nin his normal state. For instance, on one occasion a fragment of con\nglomerated or petrified bones, said to be the bones of Christian\nmartyrs slaughtered by wild beasts at the Coliseum in Rome, was\nplaced in Mr. Williams' hand and produced a vivid description of a\nfight between men and beasts in an amphitheatre. In this case there\nappears to have been at least thought-transference, for no one in the\nroom, except Mr. Adamson, who brought the fragment, knew normally\nwhat it was. At the same time, if we suppose the percipient to have\ngot from Mr. Adamson's mind the ideas of Rome and Christian\nmartyrs, there may have been material in his own mind for the\ndevelopment of these ideas into the scene at the Coliseum. It should\nbe stated as regards thought-transference, and as making rather against\nits occurrence with these percipients, that Mr. Dobbie says :\u2014,\n\" I have scores of times tried my level best to cause clairvoyants to see\npictures and visions by conjuring up in my own mind the most vivid pictures\nimaginable, but up to the present moment I have never succeeded in making\nmy clairvoyants think one thought or say or see anything I have tried to\nmake them see in that way.\"\nIt is further worth observing that like all clairvoyants, so far as\nI know, Mr. Dobbie's are not to be depended on to give correct informa\ntion. He remarks :\u2014,\n\f72 Mrs, H. Sidgwick.\n\" The part which puzzles me most is the fact that very often they are\nentirely wrong, even when I am fully aware of the nature or history of the\nspecimen I place in their hands, also when the visitors know. \"\nAnd again :\u2014\n\" I have little confidence in the abilities of my clairvoyants to track the\nWhitechapel murderer. I tried them once in tracing a prominent man who\nsuddenly disappeared from Adelaide two or three years ago, and was found\ndead a fortnight afterwards. My clairvoyants insisted that the man was\nalive and wandering about south of Adelaide, whereas he must have been\ndead all the time, and was found north of Adelaide. \"\nThe account to be next given, is sent by A. S. Wiltse, M.D., of\nSkiddy, Kansas, U.S.A., an Honorary Associate of the American\nBranch of the S.P.R. Dr. Wiltse's own comments on his experiments\nbring out the noteworthy points so fully, that no further remark is, I\nthink, called for from me.\n(M. 21.) Some Experiments in Hypnotism.\n\" Some time in the summer of 1882 I chanced to the good fortune of\nfinding an excellent subject for hypnotism in the person of Fannie G., aged\nabout fifteen years, and as the girl was serving us in the capacity of general\nhouse servant, I was enabled to carry on my experiments for several weeks\ntogether.\n\"I regret that, having then no idea of publishing the results of my\nexperiments, I took no notes ; but as I seldom take notes anyway, and\nnever keep a diary, purposely training my mind to retentiveness, I am sure\nI can recite the main points ; and as the experiments were witnessed by many\nof my neighbours I think some of my statements can be verified by the\ntestimony of some of these eye-witnesses.\n\"I had placed the subject under the full hypnotic trance several times\nbefore she began to develop clairvoyant phenomena.\n\" In a former paper I have shown under what thorough test conditions I\nworked,1 suffice it here to say that no possible gap for deception was left\nopen.\n\"The clairvoyant powers of my subject were first brought to notice by\nsome spectator asking me to see if she could not see what was transpiring in\nthe next room. The experiment was tried, and succeeded partially, but\nafter being persisted in for a few days, she developed a power of vision\n(clairvoyant), which seemed practically to have no limit.\n1 The paper referred to is one that was read before the Owosso Academy of\nMedicine, in 188li, and of which a copy has been made for us by Dr. Wiltse's sister.\nIn this paper Dr. Wiltse describes the tests he applied to make sure that the hypnotic\ntrance, which could be induced in from five to twenty minutes, was genuine. He also\ngives accounts of Experiments II., III., IV., and V. in the text, which agree with\nthose here given.\nThe following passage of the earlier paper, though it has no direct bearing on the\nsubject of clairvoyance, is worth quoting, especially as the transference of sensations\nis referred to in the corroborative testimony appended to Dr. Wiltse's account.\n\"After several sittings I discovered that although the girl was insensible to painful\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 73\nExperiment I.\n\"The company being seated along the two ends and one side of the room,\nclosely together, like children at a spelling match, the subject was thoroughly\nhypnotised, then aroused sufficiently to be able to talk, although not to open\nher eyes, and a watch was passed back and forth, secretly, among the row of\npersons, always behind their backs. I was often myself deceived as to\nwho held the watch, but Fannie invariably indicated, either by name or\npointing to, the person who held the watch. Parties would frequently change\nhands with the article at the very instant the holder was named, but she\nalways indicated such change of hands.\n\"She could not, however, tell the hour indicated upon the dial, even\nwhen the watch was held by a person in front of her. (Mrs. Wiltse tells\nme the girl could not tell the time of day by the clock when in normal\ncondition, as she had never learned.)\"\nExperiment II.\n\" Miss Florence F., now Mrs. R., a neighbour, was invited to attend one\nevening with tests which she was to arrange during the day. She came and\ntold the subject to go to her kitchen and tell her what she saw. It was about\ntwenty rods to Miss F.'s kitchen. Subject was led to suppose she had gone\nto the kitchen, and being asked what she saw, readily answered : ' The table\nsits in the centre of the room, and upon it is a box covered with a cloth. '\n' What is in the box, Fannie?' I asked. ' Oh, I daren't look in the box ! Miss\nFlorence might be mad. ' ' Miss Florence is willing you should look ; raise\nthe cloth, Fannie, and tell me what is there. ' She immediately answered,\n' There are seven loaves of bread and sixteen biscuits in it. ' (Correct.)\n\"I set this down as telepathy because Miss Florence F. was in the\nroom, and undoubtedly the facts were prominently in her mind, having been\npurposely so arranged by her for a test ; but what follows is not so plainly\ntelepathy.\n\"Miss Florence asked Fannie to tell her what was in her stable. She\nanswered, ' Two black horses, one grey horse, and one red horse' (meaning a\nbay horse). Miss Florence : ' That is wrong, Fannie ; there are only my\nblack horses in the stable. ' Ten or fifteen minutes later, a brother of Miss\nFlorence came to the house and told Miss Florence that there were travellers\nat the house, and upon inquiry we learned that the grey and ' red ' horse\nbelonged to them, and that they had been in the stable half an hour when\nFannie's clairvoyant eye scanned it.\n'' Of course we recognise the fact that there may be set up the theory that\nFannie gleaned her knowledge from the minds of some of the parties at the\nimpressions, as far as her own person was concerned, she was quite sensitive to such\nimpressions in my own body. Thus, when standing behind her at a distance of several\nfeet, with my hands behind me, if a pin were thrust into my right hand, her right\nhand moved and attempted to evade the pin thrust ; if I tasted, though never so slyly,\nany pleasant substance, no sooner was the sense of taste fully established in my own\nmouth than She began smacking her hpsas if she tasted something agreeable. If, on\nthe contrary, I tasted something bitter or nauseous, she made wry faces and feeble\nefforts to eject it. Some things pleasant to me seemed unpleasant to her : for instance,\nI mast refrain from smoking while she was under the mesmeric influence, as it nau\nseated her, although the smoking of others in the room had no effect upon her.\"\n\f74 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nresidence of Miss Florence, or that by telepathic sympathy with her brother\nor father Miss Florence was unconsciously aware of the facts, and Fannie\ngathered her information from that unconscious source ; but in attempting to\nestablish a vera causa we should be very particular to bridge our way to it\nwith theories which most strongly appeal to reason and sound judgment, as\nprobably containing fact, and the latter of these theories at least will seem\nvery ' far fetched ' indeed. \"\nExperiment III.\n\" I told the subject to go with me to Chattanooga (ninety-eight miles\ndistant ; a city she had never visited. Indeed I am quite positive she had\nnever been in any city).\n\" ' Now we are there,' I said ; ' tell me how you like my brother's house.'\n' The house is nice, ' she said, ' but the side-walk is awful narrow. ' Which\npeculiarity was in my own mind at the instant. I then asked her to go with\nme into the house, and pretending we had gone in, asked her to tell me what\nshe saw. She immediately gave an accurate description of the furniture of\nthe sitting-room, apparently beginning at one corner and passing in order\naround the room, but coming to the piano, an instrument she had never seen,\nshe said, ' There is something funny, what is it 1 ' and described it very well,\nspeaking of the keys as pieces of white bone with short pieces of black wood\n(the black keys) between them.\n' ' Query : If she read all this from my mind, why could she not read the\nname, or at any rate the nature of the piano ? They were there in more\nlegible form, it seems to me, than the rest of the matter, although, as Mr.\nHodgson suggests,\u2014 as I believe correctly solving the mystery,\u2014she saw\nmore in picture form than otherwise.\"\nExperiment IV.\n\"Mrs. S. J. W., whose husband was the manager of a variety theatre in\nLouisville, Ky., some hundreds of miles distant, asked for information in\nregard to him. Proceeded in the usual manner, but got no results except\nuseless exclamations of surprise about ' bill buildings, ' ' lots of people, ' &c.\nFinally Mrs. S. J. W., who is a believer in all sorts of incantations, witch\ncraft, &c. , took a ring from her purse which she said she had taken from her\nhusband's finger, and dropping it in Fannie's palm said : ' May be that will\nput you on the trail ! '\n' ' By what I think may firstly be set down as a curious coincidence,\nFannie began, in a very few moments afterwards, to describe the lady's\nhusband (whom she had never seen, but I had), giving an excellent descrip\ntion of him, and said, ' There are lots of people coming, and he is giving\nthem some sheets of yellow paper with reading on them, but he has little\ncards that they have to pay him for.' To all present it seemed plain that the\nyellow papers were the programmes, the cards the tickets ; but as to\nFannie's knowledge of such things during her normal state, I doubt if she\nknew the meaning of the word theatre.\n\"Fannie now went on to describe a woman who she said was talking\nand laughing with the man, and particularly described a ring upon her finger,.\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. n\nwhen Mrs. S. J. W. flew into a tempest of rage, naming the woman, and de\nclaring that the ring was one she (Mrs. S. J, W.) had given her husband. It\nmay be proper to state that the pair had separated. As to the truth or falsity\nof the whole, I can only say that the lady wept and raved by turns, and\nfinally gave Fannie a liberal gift for the information.\n' ' The results of this experiment are so doubtful, however, and seem to\nencroach so far upon the domain of the gipsy fortune-teller that I put\nlittle confidence in it, yet it ought not to be left entirely out, as the\nseeming effect of the ring placed in Fannie's hand, which I have set down as\ncoincidence, presents a point which the seeker after fact should not neglect\nto look to in a course of experiments.\n\" The known is but a narrow strait,\nThe possible a boundless sea ;\nAnd that may not be passing strange\nThat seems impossible to me.\n\" Who shall say, for sure, but what the thing I, in ignorance and perhaps\npride, have set down as superstition and coincidence, may be the footing pre\nsented us upon some hidden but none the less natural law 1\n'' There is no supernatural\nIn highest Heaven nor lowest earth :\nIf Lazarus rose, 'twas by some law\nAs fixed as that which gave him birth.\"\nExperiment V.\n\" This night more people had congregated than could get into the house.\nThe building had but three rooms, the upright being divided by a partition\nnear the centre. The kitchen was a ' lean-to ' running the whole length of\nthe upright.\n\" Mr. William Howard had supped with us, but Fannie had not learned\nhis name. The people outside lifted Mr. Howard up quietly and set him\ninto the kitchen through the window. The door between the kitchen and\nthe room we occupied was closed, so that the kitchen was obscurely dark.\nNo one inside knew of the movement outside,which was done so quietly that\nwe heard no noise. Word was sent in that Fannie should examine the\nkitchen. Of course I knew by this that some test had been arranged there,\nbut of what it consisted I had no idea. The following dialogue then occurred.\n\"Q. : 'Fannie, will you go into the kitchen and tell me if everything\nis all right there 1 Will you?' (Shaking her gently.) Fannie: 'Yes, sir.' Q. :\n' Well, what do you see ? Is everything all right there ? ' Fannie : ' There\nis a man there ! ' Q. : ' Who is he 1 ' Fannie : ' I don't know his name ;\nhe is the man who took supper with us to-night.' Q. : ' What is he doing,\nFannie ? ' Fannie : ' Oh, he is standing with his ear up to the door and he\nhas your flute in his hand ; there, he has laid it down and is looking at his\nwatch. Oh, what a pretty gold watch ! ' This was just what my friend in\nthe kitchen was doing, although none of us who were in the room, neither\nany of the parties outside, knew what he was actually doing. I did not even\nknow the flute was there ; it did not belong there, but had been carelessly\nplaced, and my friend accidentally laid his hand upon it in groping his way\nthrough the dark room, and, when he overheard Fannie's remark, he put\n\f76 Mr.?. H. Sidgwick.\nit down and took out his watch to test her ability to describe his move\nments.\"\nExperiment VI.\n\" Mr. Howard, the same mentioned in Experiment V., lived six miles\nfrom me. He had just built a large frame house ; our subject had never seen\nthe house, although, I presume, she may have heard it talked of. Mr. Howard\nhad not been home for some days, and asked that Fannie should go there\nand see if all were well. She exclaimed at the size of the house, but railed\nat the ugliness of the front fence, saying she would not have ' such an old\ntorn-down ' fence in front of so nice a house. ' Yes,' said Howard, laugh\ning, ' my wife has been worrying the life out of me about the fence and the\nfront steps.' 'Oh,' interrupted Fannie, 'the steps are nice and new ! '\n' She is off there,' said Howard, ' the steps are worse than the fence.'\n' Don't you see, ' exclaimed Fannie, impatiently, ' how new and nice the\nsteps are ? Humph !' (And she seemed absolutely disgusted, judging by the\ntone.) ' I think they are real nice.'\n\" Changing the subject, Howard asked her how many windows were in\nhis house. Almost instantly she gave a number (I think it was twenty-six).\nHoward thought it was too many, but upon carefully counting, found it\nexact.\n\" From my house he went directly home, and, to his great surprise, found\nthat during his absence his wife had employed a carpenter who had built new\nfront steps, and they had been completed a day or two before Fannie had\nscanned the premises for him with her invisible telescope.\n\" Mr. Howard's son, a youth, had gone into an adjoining county and\nwas not expected back for some days. Fannie was acquainted with the young\nman (Andrew). Mr. Howard, having business back at the station, was with\nus again the next night. His faith in our ' oracle ' had assumed larger pro\nportions, and he suggested a visit home by means of Fannie's wonderful\nfaculty. She described the rooms excellently, even to a bouquet on one of\nthe tables, and said that several young people were there. Asked who they\nwere, she replied that she did not know any of them except Andrew. ' But,'\nI said, 'Andrew is not at home.' Fannie : 'Why, don't you see him ? '\nQ. : ' Sure, Fannie V F. : ' Oh, don't I know Andrew ? Right there, ho\nis. ' Mr. Howard returned home the next morning, where he found that,\nAndrew had returned late the day before, and that several young people in the\nneighbourhood had passed the evening with him. So we got another lesson\nof faith.\n\"The next experiment presents a complete chain of evidence, so that\nnothing is left isolated to set down as probable or even possible coincidence ;\nand suggestion, either conscious or unconscious, being entirely excluded, 1\nthink I may boldly lay claim to my experiments establishing clairvoyance as\na fact in the realm of the known and thoroughly demonstrated.\n\" Since beginning this article, I concluded it would not be just to trust\nentirely to my own memory, and sent back to Tennessee, where the experi\nments were made, for evidence of eye-witnesses to the experiments. The\nevidence arrived by to-day's post, January 12th, 1891, and I take pleasure\nin attaching it to the article.\"\n\fOil the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 77\nExperiment VII.\n\"Mr. Wm. Howard and Mr. N. Parker called upon me early one\nmorning (stating that they had called by request of neighbours) to ask me\nto hypnotise Fannie for the purpose of possibly gaining some knowledge of\nthe whereabouts of the body of Uncle Julian Scott, who had ridden into the\nEmerald River late the night before and was drowned. We were on the\nstreet during the conversation, and I replied that as here was an opportunity\nto settle the question of Fannie's clairvoyance being anything beyond mere\nmind-reading, we would not tell Fannie what she was to be questioned about\nuntil after she was hypnotised, so that her mind might not be at all biassed\nby any pre-supposed knowledge of the matter.\n\"We went to the house, but Fannie seemed very unwilling to be ques\ntioned without being first informed of the nature of the subject. This was\nthe first time she had been approached in quite so ceremonious and official\na manner, and it altogether aroused her suspicions. The truth was, Fannie\nhad a sweetheart, and was exceedingly fearful that someone might pry into\nhis and her secrets, as she had a belief that she would answer any question\nthat should be asked her during her trance, so that I had always to assura\nher upon my word of honour that no questions of this nature should be\nasked her. But the unusual event of two leading citizens calling purposely\nto have her ' go to sleep ' and then be questioned upon a subject of which\nshe might not be informed beforehand, was a grain too much, and she quietly\nrebelled. The matter was compromised, however, by my reducing the\nmatter in hand to writing, lotting Mrs. Wiltse read it and assure her it was\nnothing objectionable, put it into a sealed envelope, and hold for her until\nshe should wake, Mrs. Wiltse mounting guard over her while asleep, to look\nout for her interests. Under these conditions she passed readily enough\ninto the hypnotic trance.\n\"I then stated the case to her, asking her to go with us to the river,\nwhere we would take a skiff and look for the body. 'Is Uncle Julian\ndrowned ? Poor old man ! ' she exclaimed. She expressed her willingness\nto go with us, only stipulating that Mrs. Wiltse should accompany us. I\npretended to get horses, and we started (in her mind).\n\"It was three miles to the river. On the real road lived a Mrs. Hall, a\nwidow, and Fannie called out suddenly, 'There is Mrs, Hall's place ! Let\nus have her go with us ' ' ' All right, Fannie, she says she will go with us,\nand here we are already ! ' A few moments of that peculiar deep sleep to sug\ngest the passage of time, and I rouse Fanny again by a gentle shake, and say,\n' Here we are, and here is the boat ; now I will paddle slowly and you look\ncarefully into the water. Now what do you see 1 ' She immediately began\nto describe rocks, logs, snags, bottom, &c. (Suggestion. I had constantly\nto repeat the question, ' What do you see 1 Do you see anything 1 Can you\nsee the bottom ?' &c, or she would shortly be snoring.)\n\" After a little she said suddenly, as if somewhat excited, 'There is some\nthing over yonder ahead of us ! ' Q. : ' Which way, Fannie 1 ' F. : ' Right\nhand, way down yonder. Paddle nearer to it.' Q. : ' All right. Here we\ngo ! Now, what is it ? ' F. : ' I see now. It is a hat.' Q. : ' Where ? '\nF. : ' Don't you see there in that drift ? ' (This is according to Mrs. Wiltse's\nrecollection of the affair. My own is that it was in a bush.) Q. : ' Describe\n\f78 Mis. H. Sidgwick.\nthe place, Fannie, so we can get it as we come back.' F. : ' Don't you see V\n&c. And she described certain peculiarities upon the bank.\n\" Soon after this she announced an object near the left bank of the\nstream and asked to be paddled over there. Then asked if we did not see an\nold tree body under the water near the bank. Q. : ' Yes, Fannie, what\nabout it ] ' F. : ' Why, don't you see ? There is something under it.' Q. :\n' What is it, Fannie ? ' F. : ' I can't see. Paddle closer. ' Q. : ' All right !\nHere we are '. ' (Silence on Fannie's part.) Q. : 'What is it, Fannie?'\nF. : ' Some big dark thing ; I can't see what. There is a saddle there. Don't\nyou see it ? ' Q. : ' Yes, Fannie, what else ? ' F. : ' Something, but I can't\nsee it good ; the water is muddy. The saddle is there. I can see it, and one\nstirrup is gone.' Q. : 'All right. Can you see anything on the bank that\nwe may know the spot as we come back ?' F. : ' Why, of course. Don't you\nsee how the sand is worked up in that low S]jot around the roots of that\ntree ?'\n\"I see that my evidence upon the points in regard to the saddle with its\nmissing stirrup and the hat is not as explicit and at first hand as I could wish,\nnor indeed as I intend to have it yet, for I can never rest quite satisfied upon\nthose two points until I have the direct evidence of eye-witnesses. Upon\nthese subjects we must have settled facts. But although I lived in that neigh\nbourhood for some time after that, and heard a great deal of talk upon the\nsubject, I never heard the points brought in question. In fact, so far were\nthe people at large from doubting that I had performed something out of the\nusual line that many of them were afraid to come near me, for fear I might\ntake a notion to throw some horrible spell upon them, which notion was\nstrengthened by the fun-loving propensities of several of my neighbours,\nwho delighted in scaring these superstitious ones. Still, however much cir\ncumstantial evidence we may have, I advise that these two points be held\nsuspect until direct evidence is obtained. But common rumour had it that\nFannie was right upon these points. As to the rest of the points, I was\nwitness myself to the accuracy of her statements, which I will proceed to\nconclude.\n' ' We passed on down the river, Fannie professing inability to see any\nthing more of interest, and after a few minutes complaining of being tired\nand cold and teasing to go back, said there was no use to go any further, that\nthey would not find Uncle Julian now, and repeated her curious assertion\nabout the uselessness of going any farther by saying with considerable stress,\n' It will be no use ever to look below right here !' Q. : ' All right, Fannie. Wo\nwill go back, but first show us some mark by which we shall remember the\nplace, can you ! ' ' Why, don't you see ? ' she exclaimed in a tone of seeming\ndisgust. Q. : 'What is it, Fannie?' F. : 'Oh, don't you see that tall bridge?'\nQ. : ' Where, Fannie V F. : ' Why, right there ! We just now passed under\nit, right there it is. ' (Note. Bridges in these parts were very scarce. The\nEmerald River had at that time but one bridge crossing it, an iron railroad\nbridge, which I feel sure Fannie had never seen, as there was no public road\nto it, it crossing the river at a wild, isolated, almost inaccessible spot in the\nmountains, several miles from where we were sitting.) 'What kind of a\nbridge is it, Fannie ? ' I asked, purposely for a test of the reality of her\nvision, for she was now back into the realm of my own knowledge, and I was\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 79\nsomewhat surprised at her correctness. P. (hesitating for a space as if taking\na careful view, then in a tone of curious surprise) : ' Why, it looks as if it\nmust be made of iron ! ' (Suggestion.)\n'' Here ends the absolutely indisputable, independent clairvoyance of our\nsubject in this experiment, but what follows, I believe, throws much light\ninto the dark corner of natural inquiry into reasons why one should be inde\npendently clairvoyant at one moment and only so telepathically the next,\nalthough my theory would not be in place in the present article.\n'' Just as I had suggested that we were on the way back, Mr. Howard\nwas called to the door, where a neighbour informed him, in so low a tone\nthat none inside heard it, that the body had been recovered and conveyed to\nthe residence of his (Uncle Julian's) son, who lived on the bank of the river\nnear the ford where we had made our imaginary start with a boat. The\nmessage had all the appearance of truth. Mr. Howard came in looking\nrather chagrined, as I certainly felt, and informed me in a whisper of the\nnews. 'Be quiet,' I replied, 'I will try another experiment.' I didn't\nbelieve this could be successful.\n\" 'Fannie,' I said, ' here we are now at the landing. We are all of us\ncold. Let us go into the Scotts' and warm.' She agreed. I pretended we\nhad entered the house, when Fanny exclaimed in a much excited manner,\n' Why, there he is.' Q. : ' Who, Fannie V F. : ' Why, don't you see it ? '\nQ. : ' See what, Fannie 1 ' F. : ' Why, they have found Uncle Julian and got\nhim laid out. ' She then went on to speak of different relatives and friends\nwho were there, of their crying, &c. , naming such persons as we supposed it\nwould be very certain would be there.\n\" Here was telepathy, most likely, with a vengeance, for not a word of\nthe whole thing was true. The body was not recovered until fourteen days\nafter the drowning, when it was discovered by a train hand from a moving\ntrain crossing the bridge Fannie had declared we had 'just passed under,'\nwhere it had lodged upon an old drift just below the bridge. Many times\nsince then the old drift has been pointed out to me from the bridge as the\nspot ' where Uncle Julian was found,' and I have as often thought of the\nperfectly apparent prophecy of Fannie in her emphatic assertion, ' We have\njust passed under that tall bridge and it will be useless ever to look for\nUncle Julian below here ! ' I could flip a marble from the top of the bridge\ninto the drift where rested his body fourteen days after her curious trip by\nwater to that identical spot by way of\u2014what ? I listen for the answer. Had\nI possibly demonstrated the soul, as I began experimenting with the dismal\nhope of perhaps some time accomplishing fifteen years prior to this, which\nhope I had never once quite relinquished ? \"\nMrs. Wiltse writes to Mr. Hodgson :\u2014\n\" Skiddy, Morris Co., Kansas, January 16th, 1891.\n\" My husband having read to me his paper entitled ' Some Experiments\nin Hypnotism,' paragraph by paragraph carefully, I hereby certify that its\ncontents correspond substantially with my own recollection of the experi\nments as I saw them done several years ago.\n\"Mrs. Haidee Wiltse.\"\nDr. Wiltse states that he has introduced the slight differences in Mrs.\nWiltse's recollection and his own.\n\f80 Mrs. H.

Your\nstatement [the one that follows] is correct as far as it goes. But if you\nremember we asked, or rather you asked Fannie, to go into our storeroom\nand see what was in there, and she said a hind quarter of beef, which was\ntrue, we had got it late that evening. You also asked her to go in the\nkitchen and see how many loaves of bread she could find, which she told, and\non counting them after returning home, she was correct. It was in the\nwinter of '81 or '82, I think, either December, '81, or in the January or\nFebruary of '82, I cannot remember the month ; I know it was cold weather.\nIf you remember when old Julian Scott was drowned, it was about that time,\nfor if I remember right you were trying that same night to get her to find\nhis body.

She replied that there were\ntwo black horses, one grey horse, and one red horse (meaning, of courss, a\nbay horse). Miss Florence said, ' That is wrong ; there are only my two\nblacks.\" Soon after her brother came in, saying there were some travellers\nat the house, and upon inquiry we learned that these travellers had a grey\nhorse and a bay in the stable, so that after all Fannie was right, the two\nstrange horses having been there when Fannie's clairvoyant vision had looked\ninto the stable.\n' ' This statement is correct.\n\"Mrs. Florence F.

In an Appendix I give the remaining\nevidence about \"Jane,\" and some further cases sent to the Society for\nPsychical Research, but which, on account of remoteness and depend\nence on the memory of a single individual, seem to attain a lower\nevidential standard than those I have already quoted.\nIn the next number of the Proceedings we hope to print a paper by\nDr. Alfred Backman, of Kalmar, Sweden, on some experiments in clair\nvoyance of his own. Besides the evidence thus sent to the Society for\nPsychical Research, and not hitherto published, there is a considerable\namount of evidence for clairvoyance of the type discussed in the present\npaper, published in various books and pamphlets, and in the Zoist and\nother periodicals devoted to mesmerism. This I shall hope to review\non some future occasion, as in attempting to form a judgment on the\nsubject, it is important to have all the available evidence before us. \u2022\nI hope also in a future paper to discuss the evidence for other types\nof clairvoyance, especially for clairvoyance of facts unknown to any-\nhuman being.\na\n\f82 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nAPPENDIX.\nFurther Evidence about Jane.\nRemainder of Dr. F.'s Notes.\nExperiment III.\nI was determined on this occasion to give her no leading questions, and\nat the same time in no manner to cheat or deceive her. After the sleep\nwas produced, I said : \" We are on a railway, and can see a large building\nlike a mill ; where is it ? \" \" Is it a mill for grinding food ? \" she replied. I\nsaid, \" Yes. Can you find by what means the mill is made to work ? Is it a\nwind-mill ? \" \" No. \" \"Is it the water that turns the mill 1 \" \" No, it is\na steam-mill.\" I may here remark that the mill is placed by the side of a\nstream which near it communicates with the River Tyne. She then asked,\n\"May we go into the mill ? \" and upon my giving her leave, she described\nthe noise of the machinery, the flour-dust falling like snow, the miller, in\nwhite, standing by a \"poke,\" and was proceeding in her account of the\ninterior of the building when I stopped her, and told her to leave the mill\nand enter the house near it. \"Is it the small house ? \" she asked. I told\nher \" No,\" it was the larger house that I desired her to look into. She said,\n\" Is it this with the garden in front ? \" \"Yes,\" I replied, \" with the large\ngarden,\" for I was under the false impression that the garden was of con\nsiderable size. \"No, the garden is a small one, and just in front of the\nhouse,\" was the answer ; and then, as usual, she asked, \"May we go in?\"\nShe said a gentleman lived in the house, but directly afterwards corrected\nherself, and remarked he was not a gentleman, but that a gentleman had\nformerly lived in it. She now seemed very much puzzled, her face accur\nately expressing the perplexity of her mind. \"Why did the gentleman\nleave this pretty house?\" \"There is something very strange about this\nhouse. I can't understand this.\" \"Can we not tell we what it is that is so\nstrange here ? \" \"Can we not tell we why this gentleman went away?\"\n\"\"Oh, yes, it is something about a lady.\" \" Can it be this gentleman's wife\nwho died here, and thus caused him to leave it 1\" All these questions she\nasked rapidly and in an excited manner, very different from her ordinary\ncalm bearing when in the mesmeric state. At last she said, in a low tone,\n\"Now we see it was not this gentleman's wife, for she's alive ; it was a vision\nthat frightened him away.\" \" The lady was only a vision.\" \"Do we believe\nin visions ? \" \" We don't like to believe in visions, dowel\" \" Tell we why\nthe vision came to the gentleman.\" \" Had he done anything wicked to the\nlady?\" I now told her that I brought her to that house for the purpose\nof finding out why the lady haunted that house, and she must not be lazy,\nbut find out the cause. She replied, \"We are not lazy, but the lady is\nnot there now, but if we will tell we where to find her, we will go and\nlook for it.\"\nAs this was a request with which I had no means of complying, I said she\nhad better go back to the time when the gentleman lived in the house. She\ndirectly answered, \"Yes, we will.\" \"Now I see the gentleman has a wife\nand a family, and I see the vision standing before him ; but why does it\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 83\nmake these noises ? Why does it now frighten them all ? and why does it\nfrighten the servants in that way so that the gentleman is forced to leave ?\nShe thinks he has no right to be there, but why has he no right to be there ?\nIt cannot be an angel of light, can it ? It must be an angel of darkness, and\nto find out an angel of darkness we will have to go a long way, to a bad place. \"\nI said she had better find out the gentleman himself. She immediately said,\n\"Shall we go again upon the railway ? Now we have come to a large town.\nShall we go up the road to this little village i\" Finding by her description\nthat she had passed the house, I replied, \"No, you must go back again the\nsame road ; you are a little too far.\" \"Then may we go into this house,\"\nshe exclaimed, \"with a little lodge and a garden V I again told her she was\ntoo far, for the house I recognised by her description is one a few hundred\nyards beyond the one I wished her to go to. \"Now we have got to the right\nhouse, \" she remarked, \" and we see the gentleman, but why does he wear\nhis hat in this way ? and what a wide brim it is, and he is saying, ' We are\nmuch obliged to thee, friend, ' and ' I hope thou art well. ' Why does he say\nthee and thou ? we don't like that way of speaking, do we ? But he looks a\nkind gentleman. I don't see why the vision should have come to him.\" She\ncontinued her description of a member of the Society of Friends, and so\naccurately described the peculiarities of the gentleman that no one who\nknew him could doubt who was meant, but as she seemed now tired, I\nstopped her for the present, and she fell into a short sleep.\nKnowing that a public meeting was to be held that evening, and being\nsure that she had never in her life been in that street in which it was\nintended to hold it, I determined to test her powers by means of it. I there\nfore said as soon as she awoke, \"We are standing by some railings with some\ntrees within them ; now we pass through an opening, with a house on one\nside and a wall on the other, and before us, at some little distance, is a\nhouse with a portico.\" She immediately said, \" Shall we go in ?\" \" But\nthere is a glass door ; shall we go through it ? \" \" Here is a lady sitting in\na room; is she a lady ? \" I replied, \" I want you to go upstairs and turn\ninto the room on the left-hand side.\" She slowly answered, with some\nexpression of amazement, \" What ! this room? It is a very pretty room; very\npretty indeed. But what is the matter ? What are so many people doing\nhere ? And here is Mr. Fraser ; what can he be doing here? Is it about the\nchurch ? Is it about the Bible ? \" The gentleman she had detected in the\ncrowd being known to her as the minister, she had, no doubt, imagined\nfrom his presence that such must be the subject of the meeting ; but I told\nher not to be lazy, but find out why the meeting was held. \"One man,\" she\nsaid, \"is speaking, but it is neither about church nor Bible ; we can't under\nstand him. It is humbug. And he talks so much about himself, does he not ?\nHe is a very vulgar man ; but there are many very vulgar-looking men in the\nroom, and what a noise they are making.\" This experiment had lasted so long\nthat she looked tired, and having, before sitting down, complained of head\nache, I feared to continue it, lest she might be worse afterwards. I, therefore,\nat this stage, released her by the ordinary means.\nIn order to understand the first of the experiments of this evening's sit\nting I must now explain that about four miles from North Shields\u2014visible\nfrom the Newcastle and North Shields Railway\u2014is a steam mill, and near it a.\na 2\n\fMrs. H. Sidgwick.\nhouse with a garden in front, and some cottages. This house was inhabited\nsome years ago by a gentleman of the Society of Friends (Mr. Procter),\nwho eventually left it on account of the annoyance of what was and is still\nsupposed to be a ghost. As I am no more a believer in spirits than I was in\nclairvoyance, I may merely mention that forty different persons now alive\nhave stated that at different times they have seen this appearance, and in every\ncase, except two or three, it had the form of a lady. Besides, however, the\nvisionary appearances, the noises in the house were most troublesome, the\narticles of furniture being often violently thrown about. The gentleman left\nthe house, and the noises and the vision have gradually disappeared. Her\ndescription of his present residence was in every respect correct. It will, no\ndoubt, occur to many that the clairvoyante had in this case been aware of the\nwhole affair, but let anyone consider the improbability of her catching at\ni nice, without reflection, the very place I desired her to examine from the\nvery slight hint I gave her. I have since ascertained that she had only\nonce\u2014and that some years ago\u2014been upon this railway, and it is unlikely\nthat upon that occasion she would observe this particular mill so as to be able\nat present so minutely to describe it. Mills near railways are not uncommon,\nand if she had merely guessed, it is probable that she would at once have\nimagined the place to be some mill near some railroad to which she was.\naccustomed. But admitting that she had formerly seen the mill and house,\nas she rolled rapidly along the line\u2014for it is only visible at one point of the\nrailroad\u2014and that the whole story had been related to her, how was a\nstranger, living in a little street miles from Shields, able to find out the\npresent residence of the gentleman, and accurately to describe him ? Add\nto these considerations the surprise that she manifested when afterwards\ntold about it, and her denial of ever having heard about the haunted\nhouse, and few can reject the belief that there was no trick at all about\nthe case.\nThe second case is still clearer. Mr. Lindsay is one of the candidates to\nrepresent the borough of Tynemouth in Parliament. He came down un\nexpectedly on Saturday night, and bills were then issued, calling a meeting\nwherein ho intended addressing the electors on Monday. She, I have ascer\ntained, only left the house upon the Sunday, and walked along the road for a\nfew minutes, and it is in the highest degree improbable that she would there\n.see the announcement. I have also ascertained that she was never in her life\nin the street in which the meeting was held, and that she knows nothing of\nthe town at all, and my description of the Assembly Room was so vague that\nfew who have lived in Shields all their lives could have guessed it. To show\nthe truth of this, a gentleman who had been for many years resident in\nShields, and who was protesting strongly against clairvoyance, was asked the\nfollowing question : \"Supposing I say to you, We are standing beside some\nrails, with trees within them ; we now go through an opening, and see a house\nwith a portico in front of us\u2014what is that house ? \" Without hesitation he\nimmediately mentioned a house in the opposite end of the town.\nExperiment IV.\nJuly 19th, 1853.\nOn Thursday she arrived at Shields by train. She was longer than usual\nin becoming somnolent, and the first words she exclaimed were, \"Why is\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 86\nthat girl troubling us so much ? \" This she frequently repeated. The word\n\" girl \" she always applies to herself, and the above expression is used when\nshe is not likely to be lucid. She looked tired and anxious, and throughout\nthe sitting was not so clear as on former occasions.\nI had procured some handwriting of Lieutenant Pym, R.N., now in the\nsearching expedition of Sir John Franklin, but not being acquainted either\nwith the gentleman himself or the residence of his relations, I was very\ndoubtful of her discovering his whereabouts. I placed the writing in her\nhands and asked where the gentleman was who wrote that. She re\nplied, \" The gentleman who wrote this to us\u2014what does he want us to do ?\nIs it about a sick person\u2014is that it ? \" I again said, \" You must discover\nfor yourself where he is and what he wants.\" She answered, \" Let us go\nby the railway to the large town, and into this house, and see what he wants. \"\nI replied, as she seemed in great doubt and hesitation, \" You had better\nlook abroad for him. Go across the sea and look.\" \" Yes,\" she answered ;\n\" but what has he gone here for, amongst all these strange people, and this\ngrand place 1 Is he going to fight ? Is this the reason of his coming here !\nWe don't understand what these people say ; they don't speak our language.\"\nI asked if it was France, and she answered that she had been here before,\nformerly, and she believed it was France. I should here mention that, as\nmany will remember, Lieutenant Pym planned his Siberian Expedition im\nmediately before going in the searching squadron, and travelled on the\n,Continent in prosecution of his plan, but at the time I did not remember\nthis, and therefore told her to look where he was at the present time. She\nsaid he was in a very strange country, where everyone was dressed differently\nfrom here. I asked whether it was a hot or cold country. She answered,\n\" Very cold indeed,\" and grasping me tightly by the hand requested me not\nto leave her in that desolate region. I, at this stage, requested a lady who\nwas in the room to copy down all her words, which was done. '' What has\nIjrought the gentleman here ? \" I asked. \" Has he' gone to discover some\nthing ? \" was the reply ; \"we don't like to look at him. He has got a cat\njacket and cap on ; we don't like to touch him.\" She always in this state\nexpresses a great dislike to fur, and calls it cat-skin. \" We see the vessel.\nAll those about him have the same sort of jackets. Is it bear-skin they have\non ? He is a fine-looking man, all fur. This is a very white-looking place.\nIt is all white. He is middle-sized, with darkish hair, but he is so covered up\nwith cat-skin that we can only see a part of him. This is not like we's water ;\nwe can walk upon it. Why have they come to such a place as this i It is\nwinter here. Some of the men are running along. \" \"What is the name of the\nvessel ? \" I inquired. She spelt A. R., but would go no further ; she then\nsaid, \" We will spell the gentleman's name. It is a short name.\" I said that\nP was the first letter, but she could not finish it. \" Has he come to seek\nsomebody ? \" she asked. \" What is he so intent upon ? Is it to go further\nhe thinks so much about ?\" \"He had better, we think, stay where he is,\nfor he will never find what he is looking for.\" \" Is it a vessel and a gentle\nman he is looking for 1 \"\n[Some further details of the same kind followed here.]\n\f86 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nExperiment VI.\nJuly 2lst, 1853.\u2014Five minutes to nine, to about 10 minutes to 10 ;\npulse 80.\nShe was this time mesmerised by a lady who has been in the habit of doing\nit for some years, and her lucidity and rapidity of utterance were very strik\ningly increased compared with the uncertain slow manner in which she spoke\nwhen under my influence. This lady we shall call Mrs. B. [Mrs. Fraser].\nThe process consists in the operator taking Jane's thumbs in her thumb and\nforefinger of her opposite hand, and looking steadfastly into her eyes. This\nwas continued on this occasion for about a minute, when Jane gave a slight\nstart. Her head then began gradually to fall forward, when the operator\nplaced her hand above the vertex, moving it gradually backwards. The\nhead seemed to follow the hand by slightly jerking motions until she became\nquite erect in the chair. Mrs. B. then asked, \" Is that we's light ? Can we\nsee well with it ? \"\n[Some details are here omitted.]\nHere she again slept. \"Let us go out again,\" said she, upon awakening.\n\" What are we thinking of now ? \" asked Mrs. B. \" Where shall we go ? \"\nreplied Jane. \"Shall we come back here again?\" \" Yes,\"returned Mrs.\nB., \"we promised to come back to this place same sun, so we must keep our\npromises.\" \"Shall we look at it?\" was the answer. \"What is it ? What do\nyou call it?\" \" Is it a vision?\" Mrs. B. replied. \"No, that is not the\nname ; we don't like it. Why can't we get hold of the word, of we's own\nwe's word ? It is haunted house. What an ugly word. Why do we want\nto look again?\" \"We said,\" answered Mrs. B., \"that we would go into it.\"\n\"We don't care for it, do we ? \" replied Jane. \"It looks like a vision. It is.\na lady.\" \" What is it like ? \" asked the operator. \"It has a face, but not\nlike we's face. It is very white, but she moves about so quick ; she has eyes,\nbut no sight in them; she is like a shadow.\" \"Has it a name in its head?\"\nasked Mrs. B. \"No, she has no name and no brains : she is just like a\nshadow, and flits about so quickly from place to place. We don't care about\nthe lady. We want to go into the house and downstairs. AVe want to go\ninto the cellar. Is there a way to the sea in this house ? We will go down\nstairs into the lowest part and take a candle. We are not a coward. We\nwill examine and find a place to the sea. Let us look\u2014there is a cellar.\nCould not the gentleman examine the cellar? He must have stronger people\nthan we to look into them, we are too weak. We can't see any place of\nconcealment. Tell him to bring somebody to look down. There must be a\nplace of concealment. Like it ran down to the sea, and people came up for\nsome bad purpose. It seems like something about the sea. We'll tell the\ngentleman with the broad hat about this. We's not afraid, there must be\nsomething concealed there, and it might be found out in this cellar, and we\nwill come and help him. Let us go to the gentleman.\" \" Would he like to\nsee we's sleep?\" said Mrs. B. \"We want this place looked into, and,\nmind, not a slight examination, for something will be found there.\" \"Are\nthey real people, then?\" asked Mrs. B. \"Well, she is a strange one, and\nwalks about so quietly.\" \"Has it spoken?\" said the operator. \"Yes it\nhas spoken. But there are so many, there are two or three kinds of animals.\nWe's only a coward after all.\" \"What are the animals like?\" inquired\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 87\nMrs. B. \"We won't be afraid,\" was the reply. \"Do we like to look?\nOne is like a monkey, and another like a dog. Had the lady dogs and\nmonkeys ? They go all about the house. She has got funny things, has she\nnot ? We don't like her. What is that other one ? Do we know what we\ncall it ? It is not a pussy, it runs very fast, and gets amongst feet. It is a\nrabbit, but a very quick one.\" \"Are they real animals?\" said Mrs. B.\n\"We don't touch them to see,\" replied she; \"we would not like a bite.\nWhat a very violent woman she is. She wants to stay all alone in that\nhouse, but we can't see into her, she is so strange. We have never seen her\neat any supper nor anything else.\" \"Has she a name in her head?\" inquired\nMrs. B. \"No, she has no brains. She is now going upstairs, and it is so\ndark. She has no light with her, but we have light.\" \" Are the animals\nwith her now ? \" said Mrs. B. \" No, they are not. She is all white : it is\nloose, not a dress like we's, but something loose thrown over her. She dis\nturbs everybody.\" \" Why don't they catch her? \" asked Mrs. B. \"Because\nshe moves so quickly. But the mischief is in the cellar, and tell the gentle\nman to look there.\"\n[Here again she slept.]\nUpon awakening she said, \"We won't have her for ours.\" \"Is she\nalways the same ? \" inquired the operator. \" We will look,\" was the reply.\n\"Now she is coming downstairs again to go her rounds. She makes we\nfeel cold. Now she is as dark as the devil. It is very strange ; we don't\nlike her.\" \"Look and see what her dress is like,\" said Mrs. B. \" We will.\nIt is not like we, for it is all dark. Where have we seen anything like it before ?\nIt is not like we's English ladies' dress. Where has she got that ? It is like\nthe dress we saw in foreign countries\u2014a Spanish lady kind of dress. They\nare rich things she has on ; it rustles like silk. Is it not strange ? She is\njust like a devil.\"\n[A few more details followed.]\nExperiment IX.\nJvly mh or 29th, 1853.\nShe was again sent to see the \" haunted house,\" when she said she saw\nthe figure of a man who also troubled them. Mrs. B. asked her if it was\nnot a real man she saw. Could it not be the person who now lived there ?\nbut she said, ' ' No, it is a vision ; he has no brains in his head ; he looks\nvery fierce, his eyes flash like a torn cat's\u2014like a tiger's ; he has a white\ndress on like a surplice. Oh, how angry he is ! he is so indignant at being\ndisturbed ; he does not want the gentleman to find out what he is there for.\nIt is the man who makes the noises in the house ; he goes stamping about.\nWe did not like the woman, but the man is far worse. Oh, how angry he\nis ! What a commotion there is in the cellar ! They have not made the\nhole large enough ; it is not close enough to the wall. They must make a\nwide, deep hole close to the wall, and they should take down the wall.\" Mrs.\nB. said, \" But perhaps the house will fall if they take the wall down.\" She\nreplied, \" Never mind, if they only find it out.\" She said that the woman\nwalked about with her hands upon her breast as if in pain ; but the man goes\nstamping about very angry. \" Oh ! how indignant he is that the gentleman\nis digging in the cellar.\"\n\f88 Mrs. H. Sidywick.\nShe was also taken to St. Paul's Cathedral, which she described most\naccurately. Upon first entering she seemed amazed at the beauty of the\nbuilding, and said, \" What a number of beautiful figures ! These are not\nvisions, these are made of marble.\" She also described the scutcheons, and\nthe stained glass windows, and the Communion, &c., &c. She also said\nthere was a large gallery that went all round, and that there was a sound in\nit. It was not music, but a sound which went all round inside the wall.\nShe said there were no queer monkish-looking men here, as she saw in St.\nPeter's at Rome. Those were Popish we's ; she did not like Popish we's ;\nbut she saw a clergyman go into the pulpit. It was not we's clergyman. She.\nalso seemed very much to admire some of the fine old oak carving and a\npicture.\nMrs. Fraser's Recollections.\nIn the year 1845, I first became acquainted with \"Jane.\" She was a\ngreat invalid, not able to leave her bed, but was propped up with pillows,\nand made a little money by needlework. One day, when I called to see her,\nI was told by her sister that I could not see her as the infirmary doctor had\njust mesmerised her. I sent up a message, begging that I might be admitted,\nand the doctor consenting I went up. I asked him if he never tried any\nexperiments. \" No,\" he replied, \" I have promised her not. \" On waking,\nI asked her consent. So the next day I took with me a phrenological head.\nDr. Maltby went to the closet and ate something. He returned to \" Jane,\"\nand placing his finger on \" gustativeness,\" asked what he was eating. \" It\nis sugar.\" He ate something else. \" What am I eating 1 \" She showed\ngreat disgust, and said, \" Not good.\" He whispered to me, \" I have a pill\nin my mouth.\"\nNext visit I proposed we should try if she was a clairvoyante, and asked\nMr. M. to take her to our house and find out what I had been doing that\nmorning. She found the house and went into the parlour, and there seemed to\nsee me in an armchair with my feet on the tender, &e., and a large book\nupon my knee. She was quite correct. Then she was taken to the infirmary\nand accurately described one of the wards, and particularly mentioned a\nsoldier who was in one of the beds. After this, Mr. M. took her to other\nplaces, but as it was not convenient for him to continue to give her the sleep\nI took his place. I think it was as soon as I was left alone with her that I\nthought I would try another experiment. I found that she ate very little,\nhad no appetite, and took no butcher's meat, so I thought I would get her to\neat whilst in the sleep. Consequently I took some thin slices of cold roast\nbeef, and when she was quite over I got her to eat some, but before she had\nfinished I heard Dr. Trotter downstairs, so I awoke her, first of all hiding\nthe rest of the meat and bread. When he came up, amongst other questions\nhe asked if she had eaten any breakfast 1 and she said \" No.\" Whereupon\nI said, '' Oh, Jane, how can you say so when you have been eating both meat\nand bread ? \" and then I pulled out the remnant of her feast. Great was\nher surprise, and of course Dr. Trotter was astonished also.\nDr. Trotter was the physician for the infirmary of which Jane was an\noutdoor patient. He was out at dinner, one day, with Mr. Williamson, of\nGateshead, brother of Sir Hedworth Williamson, and the conversation turned\nupon mesmerism, and Mr. Williamson said at one time he had ridiculed it,\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance, 89\nI>ut that a short while before meeting Dr. Trotter he was in Paris with some\nother friends, and one very wet day, just to amuse themselves, they proposed\nto try and mesmerise the cook, and to their great surprise they were quite\nsuccessful, and went on to mention some more particulars. So Dr. Trotter\ntold him of a patient of his who could not sleep, and it was arranged that\nMr. Williamson should accompany him on the following day, and put her\ninto the mesmeric sleep. This was done, and then Mr. Maltby, the house\nsurgeon, was taught how to put her over, and it was found that from that day\nshe began to sleep at night.\nAt that time Mr. Williamson knew nothing about clairvoyance. Some\nmonths after he came to Durham, and called upon us in order to try and\nmesmerise Mr. Green, and I took the opportunity of telling him about\n\" Jane's \" powers. He said, \" I believe in mesmerism, but not in clair\nvoyance.\" He had been arranging for Jane to go and stay with him for\nsome time that he might be able to mesmerise her, and I thought he\nwould soon find out for himself whether what I had told him was true or\nnot, so I said nothing, and she went, and as I expected, the first time he\nmesmerised her she began with her usual question, \"Where shall we go\nthis sun ? \" First, of course, expressing surprise at the new \"we\" she had\ngot. \" It is not Miss Eliza we, and it is not our black we \" (that was Jane's\nsister). \" What we is it? \" Afterwards she called him her \" very own we.\"\nAs she was determined to go somewhere, he asked where she would go ?\nand she answered along the road. She seemed in a short time to see two\ncottages, and said, \"May we go into this cottage?\" and to the great\nastonishment of Mr. Williamson she told him about all the inmates. Now,\nas she was an utter stranger in that neighbourhood, he knew quite well\nthat she could have no acquaintance with these cottagers, and from that time\nwas a believer in her wonderful powers of clairvoyance, and took her to one\nplace after another, frequently to the House of Commons. She took quite a\nfancy to some of the members, saying, \"Ah, there is we Shott \" (a personal\nfriend of Mr. Williamson), \"and there is we's\"\u2014mentioning the names of\nother gentlemen whom I cannot just now remember. Mr. Williamson took\nher now and again to some place of entertainment, and she greatly enjoyed\nbeing at Astley's, and laughed heartily at seeing the tricks of the clown, and\nexpressed much surprise at seeing the horses jump through hoops.\nMr. Williamson had a lady staying with him whose name I quite forget ;\nhe was mesmerising her for her health, and he began to try if she also was\na clairvoyante, and found she was, and a very eerie effect was produced upon\nme some months after,when I had Jane asleep in our own house, by her say\ning, after one of the little sleeps which she had begun to take in the course of\nthe seance, \"Do we know that the lady we is here 1 Our very own we has\nbrought her to see we, they went first to the girl's ' Jane's ' house, and then\ncame here.\"\nOne day I asked Jane what was the cause of her being able to do such\nwonderful things as to see into people's minds, and so on. She answered by\n'\" Lectricity.\" She spoke in a very childish manner when asleep, cutting\nshort her words.\nIt was very extraordinary the insight she seemed to have into the charac\nter of those persons she saw ; for instance, when visiting one gentleman who\n\f90 Mrs. H. &idgwicl:\nlived at some distance, and who had never been mentioned to her, she said\nat once, \" This is a backslider.\" When she was taken to see the missionary,\nMr. Moffat, she said, \"Now this is one of the most unselfish men we ever\nsaw.\" It was very interesting to find that when she visited these far-off\nplaces she noticed the different trees to what she had seen at home, and she\ncertainly felt either great heat or great cold. I especially remember one\nday, when she asked to get away from Africa, she was so hot, and seemed to\nrejoice in the cool breezes of the sea. She also seemed to feel the scent of\nflowers.\nI forget the year when Isabella, Queen of Spain, was married, but we\nseveral times saw her at the time the marriage was talked about, and Jane\nexpressed great sorrow for her, saying she wished to marry someone else,\nand was crying. One day she was playing with the tassel of my silk apron\nin her sleep when suddenly she said, \"That is a nice tassel, but nothing to\nwhat we's little Queen has ; it is a gilt one.\" I asked her why she had never\nmentioned it before, and she answered quite crossly, \"Do we think we tell\neverything we see ? \"\nOne of the peculiarities of her sleep is that time seems to be nowhere\nwith her ; she will tell you of something which seems to be taking place at\nthe time she mentions it, and you find afterwards that it occurred some\nhours previously. For instance, when she was here about twelve years ago,\nI took her, at the request of a lady present, to see her sisters in Edin\nburgh. She found the house, described the furniture and ornaments in the\ndrawing-room, and a lady not very young, then she added, \" But there is a\nyoung lady here, the other lady is her aunt.\" My friend was sure this was a\nmistake, for her niece had been very ill, and unable for many weeks to visit\nher aunt. However, she wrote to her sister in Edinburgh, and asked her,\n\" Have you seen our niece lately 1 \" The answer came that her niece was so\nmuch better that she had been to see them on the morning of such a day ;\nthat was the very day when Jane had seen her, only it was some hours\nafter the real time.\nSome people have said Jane only knew what the person knew who gave\nher the sleep. This was a very great mistake, as was proved on one occasion\nin a very remarkable manner. My eldest brother had a friend staying with\nhim, a young gentleman from Northumberland. He wished her to be taken\nto his father's house. To the best of my powers I took her there, when, to\nmy utter consternation, she began to express the greatest horror of my\ntaking her to such a house, the master was such a wicked* man, and had, if I\nremember aright, hanged himself in an out-house of the farm. Mr. Rae,\nhowever, soon put me at ease by saying I had got to the wrong house. What\nJane had mentioned was all true of what had taken place at a short distance\nfrom his father's house.\nThere were many peculiarities about Jane's sleep. For instance, she\nalways said she must have a good light for what she was to go and see, and\nthis light she got by the mesmeriser placing both hands on either side of her\nhead. She was sometimes taken to see invalids, and in more than one\ncase advised what medicine should be given, and it was always the right one\nfor the disease.\nMr. Williamson had a friend called Dr. Meyer ; ho often took Jane to see\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 91\nhim, and once she had a good deal of trouble, as he had left the place where\nMr. Williamson took her ; but eventually she got upon his track, and found\nhim at some watering-place in Germany.\nMy sister-in-law reminds me that one day when Dr. F. was not present,\nshe said in her sleep that he was very sorry for the girl, and was going to give\nher some money, and that a short while afterwards, without his knowing that\nshe had said so, he gave her \u00a32.\nWith regard to the excavations made by Mr. Procter at Willington,\nnothing was discovered.\nI am sorry I did not make notes at the time, for I find I have forgotten so\nmany things, and more wonderful things than those I have related.\nEliza Fraser.\n12, Moray-place, Crosshill, Glasgow.\nAn Incident Recalled by the Rev. C. Green.\nMr. Charles Green was interested in a lady in London, and asked that\nJane should be sent to the house, to find out what was going on there. She\ndiscovered the house, went upstairs, and, to her horror, found that the young\nlady was dead, and the corpse laid out. Then she said, \" What is this that\nthey are bringing in\u2014the coffin 1 \" Then she went and looked at the plate\nupon it, and read aloud the girl's name and age. She then made the remark ::\n\" The family is in great sorrow, but they sorrow not as those without hope,\"\nand \"they want Mr. Charles to officiate at the funeral. He will get a letter\nin the morning, as they 'have written to him.\"\nNext day, the letter came announcing her death, and requesting Mr,\nCharles to go to the funeral.\nCharles Green,\nVicar of St. Paul's, Beckenham.\nFurther Statement by Mrs. T. Myers.\nMay, 1884.\nMrs. S. D. Wills remembers, when a girl, being present when I gave\n\" Jane \" the sleep, and we went to seek my father and mother who were in\nLondon. We did not know when to expect them home, so we sent her to\nfind out. She said they were busy packing up and we should see them home\nnext day. And certainly they arrived. Mrs. S. D. Wills only saw Jane a.\nfew times and was much struck with her correctness.\nOnce, when disinclined to trouble with Jane and having to give her the\nsleep for the good of her health, I told her she must take a tour in Scotland,\nby herself, and enjoy the scenery. My mind was far away when, suddenly,\nshe said, \" What is this 1 \" I answered, \"How do I know 1 I do not know\nwhere 'we' is.\" Angrily, \"Don't 'we' know 'we' is travelling in Scot\nland?\" \"Well, where are 'we' now?\" \"'We' see a castle.\" \"Find\nout its name, for I have no idea where ' we ' has wandered to. \" She said,\n\" ' We' is on a steamboat, and 'we' know now it is Dumbarton Castle ! \"\nIn the sleep she sees and enjoys very much all the beauties of nature, and\nalso enters into all the amusement of a walk, in Scarboro' on the See-Saw,\nHyde Park, and other gay scenes at home and abroad. She visited the\nExhibition of 1862, long before I went up to it, and she described the\nentrance-door, near the Golden Obelisk, and was much struck with the size\n\f92 Mr<s. H. Sidgwick,\nand beauty of the latter ; and then she walked about and enjoyed herself\nvery much. She made me promise to go and see Emanuel's jewellery and\nMinton's china, and gave me directions where to find their cases. I found\nshe had been most correct in her description, even to sets of jewels and\nchina, selecting the most beautiful to her thinking. She had never read\nanything about the Exhibition or been told anything, for Jane is in lowly\nlife and does not hear what is going on in London or elsewhere.\nRecollections of \"Jane's\" Sister.\nMay 13th, 1884.\nDear Mrs. Myers,\u2014I am sorry that I cannot remember much about\nmy sister Jane being put into the sleep. I remember once when I had her\nin the sleep (we being upstairs at the time) a gentleman came in downstairs,\nwhen she said, \"Who is that?\" I said I did not know, and she at once\nsaid, \" Didn't we know the dark gentleman 1 \" I did not know; she then\nheld up her fingers and spelt his name, which turned out to be quite correct.\nOn another occasion sister Bessie had been out making purchases, and when\nshe returned Jane named all the articles that Bessie had got in the basket,\nwhile I knew nothing that she had got in the basket.\nI also remember on one occasion when Mr. Williamson had her in the\nsleep, she gave a very beautiful and correct description of St. Peter's\nChurch at Rome. I know of my own knowledge that when she was out of\nthe sleep she knew nothing about the church at Rome. I should have been\nglad if I had remembered more to have acquainted you with it, but as it hap\npened so long ago the particulars have almost escaped my memory.\nI know nothing of the clergyman at Whickham, but I remember Mr.\nWilliamson had a nephew, a clergyman at Darlington, some years ago (perhaps\n20 years ago), but I seem to have lost sight of them all years ago.\nI heard from Jane yesterday, and she is still very poorly ; and as regards\nmyself I feel that I am getting old and feeble, but I have much to be thank\nful for, as I have a comfortable home.\nCharlotte Hope.\nNotes of an Interview with \"Jane,\" by Mrs. Russell.\nJuly 22)i(7, 1883.\n\"Let us go and see 'Katie.'

Bella Bainbridge was my\nservant, who was acquainted with \"Katie,\" and was with her at the very\ntime ; she had on a hat. When she returned an hour or two after, she\nreported to Mrs. F. that \" Katie \" was much better. Her friends were\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 93\nmuch surprised to see her having got no worse.

Mrs. F. replied, \"Oh, yes, I am stupid.

The question, \" Can we do her\nany good ? \" refers to her having twice said that to use the \" passes \" upon\ninvalids would do them good.

Experiments by Mr. Theophilus Criswick with Miss R.\nSwansea, June 16th, 1884.\n\" I was the engineer of the Plymouth Iron Works, Merthyr Tydvil, and\nleft in 1864. It was some few years previous (I should think from 1853 to\n1858) that circumstances or inclination induced my devoting some attention\nto satisfy myself as to whether some (so-called) mesmeric phenomena were\ntrue or not.\n*****\n\" I tried to send some persons to sleep, <fcc, by gazing into their eyes, by\npasses from the head downwards, &c., and found several sensitive. . . .\nOne of those that was susceptible to the influence was a Miss R. After\nfalling into the so-called mesmeric sleep, it was easy to induce her to talk, to\nget up, &c, and in her, as well as others, I was always struck by the improve\nment of expression during the sleep.\n\"Upon one occasion she was seated, and an aunt of mine coming in\nfront of her, a decided shudder took place. On inquiring the cause I was\ntold ' She looked so nasty,' and further inquiry convinced me that the one\nasleep looked into or perhaps through a living person. I am not sure\nwhether it was then or subsequently, but we were in the same room, which\nwas a kind of room used for meals, and Miss R. was asleep, that I asked\nmy aunt to go into the front room (fitted up more as a drawing-room), and\ndo whatever she had any inclination to. This was done, and Miss R.\ncorrectly described what was done. Now, taking a direct line from where\nMiss R. was, and the place where my aunt was doing, there were three brick\npartitions of 6in., and a stone wall of 20in., at least, say a yard of (so-called)\nsolid material interposed. Perhaps I should say that several things very\nunusual were done by my aunt ; for instance, the placing of a chair on the\ntable, and changing its position there, turning a picture on the wall, &c., the\nwhole of which were accurately described to me whilst being done. Pray\nremember that my object being for investigation only, and having no\ninterest to serve in any way\u2014conscious there was no collusion\u2014I was com\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 95\npelled to believe she had either Been through a yard of wall or was able\nto say what was fact, even if the means used were more wonderful than look\ning through what was interposed.\n\"Several tests of other phenomena were also made with the same per\nson. If I put anything in my mouth, she imitated mastication, &c, and\ndescribed the taste. Putting a tasteless (or nearly tasteless) substance in\nmy mouth, and thinking of the taste of another thing, she would describe\nthe taste as that of the substance thought of, or without placing anything in\nmy mouth, the taste of anything desired would be stated.\n\" I also found she could detect a wineglass of water, although put in\nany position with others precisely similar, provided I made some so-called\npasses down it after filling. Interrogated as to the difference in taste (for it\nwas by that only she often said she detected it), her words were that it tasted\npleasanter.\"\nMr. Criswick forwarded to Mr. Gurney a paper of testimonials, of which\nthe following is a specimen :\u2014\n\"Duffryn, Aberdare, October 1st, 1878.\n\"I have long known Mr. Theophilus Criswick, C.E., who was long the\ntrusted agent of the late Mr. Anthony Hill, of the Plymouth Iron Works,\nMerthyr, and who in that capacity acquired great experience in all that\nappertains to the work of a surveyor. I believe him to be a man not only\nof great practical knowledge and ability, but of high character.\n\" Aberdare.\"\n(M. 1,900.) Experiments by Mr. Glover with G. F.\nWe are indebted to Mr. J. J. T. Glover, of 124, Stephen's Green,\nDublin, an Associate of the S.P.R., for the following account of some\nexperiments of his own, which he wrote out at the request of Professor\nBarrett, on February 9th, 1885. The incidents themselves occurred, he tells\nus, about fifteen years earlier.\n\"On another occasion, one evening, about 8 or 9 o'clock, at a rather\nnumerous party, I placed the young man,G. F., in the extreme hypnotic state,\nand after several present had tested his insensibility by sticking pins in his\narms and passing a lamp in front of his eyes (the pupils remaining unaffected),\nI tried if I could obtain any of the phenomena of clairvoyance.\n\" Avoiding leading questions, he faithfully described the interiors of the\nsleeping rooms of many of those present, and to which he had never had\naccess, also the show-cards and posters on the platform of the Tralee Station\nof the Great Southern and Western Railway, but those he had often observed\nin his ordinary condition.\n\"Someone now proposed to test him by asking for the description of a\nlocality which he had never seen, and Kingstown, near Dublin, was sug\ngested. He had up to this time never been farther from home than Killar-\nney, some twenty miles distant. He gave a perfectly correct delineation of\nKingstown Harbour, piers, mail steamer at station, &c. Directing him to\ndescribe anything further, he answered, 'I see a large vessel coming in.' I\nasked for more particulars, and he replied, ' She is too distant. ' I then told\nhim to take a boat or reach her by any means he liked. Seemingly getting\n\f96 Mrs. H. SUlgwiek.\nnearer he continued in a few minutes : ' It is a large ship, and she has\ntroops on board, I can see the soldiers.' I requested him to ascertain her\nname. ' The Hhnallah ' (sic) was his reply, adding that he could not see\nvery plainly. I encouraged him to try again, and he repeated, ' The\nHimallyca, or Him-a-leyah,' each time using a tri-syllabic word as nearly as\npossible resembling ' Himalaya.'\n\"The remarkable circumstance in this case is, that two days afterwards\nI read in the IriJi Times of the arrival in Kingstown Harbour, from India,\nof the troopship Himalaya, bringing soldiers, &c. It was utterly impossible\nfor any one present to have had the slightest inkling of this. Certainly I\nknew Kingstown well, and as well as I can recollect was aware that there was\nsuch a vessel as the Himalaya, and that she wasemployed as a troopship, but\nthere all ordinary knowledge ceased. If it was merely a haphazard thought\nof mine conceived spontaneously, and in some way transferred to G. F. 's\nmind without contact or suggestion, then the coincidence with actual fact was,\nto say the least, very remarkable ; but my own impression and that of all\npresent was that it was an undoubted instance of what is termed clair\nvoyance.\n\" In the cases of the contents of rooms, &c, which he had never seen, it\nis possible that he became conscious of the thoughts of others through the\nmind of the operator, for by no means could anyone communicate by sign,\nsound, or otherwise, any idea to him, unless through me, the operator. In\nfact the ordinary theory of thought-transference fails to account satisfactorily\nfor all of the phenomena that are here described. I may mention that\nthis was the last experiment I tried on G. F., inasmuch as his father called\non me the next day and requested that I would discontinue further investiga\ntion. Of course I complied.\n* * * *\n\"J. J. T. Glover.\"\n(M. 319.) Experiments by Mr. H. T. Humphreys with E. Maguire.\n66, Doddington-grove, Kennington, November, 1883.\nIn the year 1852 I frequently mesmerised persons who were in the\nemployment of Joseph Humphreys and Son (the latter myself), millers, of\nKilmarow Mills, situated in the southern part of the County of Kilkenny,\nand about four and a-half miles from Waterford.\nOne evening I had in my room at the mill Edward Maguire, a man who\nhad then been employed at the mills for more than 12 years, and was at the\ntime a night miller, working- at a small mill belonging to us about a mile or\nso lower down the stream. He had come in previous to going down to his\nnight's work. His house, in which he had been sleeping during the day,\nwas, perhaps, 300 yards more distant from Waterford than the mills in which\nmy room was.\nI put him to sleep, and it then occurred to me to try if he were clairvoyant,\nas I had read of the phenomenon, but had never witnessed a case. I asked\nhim, \" Can you go anywhere ? \" He replied, \"Yes, I can go anywhere.\" I\nsaid, \"You know where Malcolmson's foundry is, on the Newtown road, just\nbeyond Waterford ? \" \"Yes,\" he said, \"I am there.\" \" Go on,\" I said,\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 97\n' ' past it till you come to a large house standing in from the road. Next to\nthis is a row of four houses, and next beyond it is another large house.\"\n\"I see it,\" he said. \"Go in,\" I said, \" through the gate. You see to the\nleft hand a door painted green, leading into the garden behind the house. \"\n\" Yes,\" he said. \" Go through that door and you will find another door on\nthe left hand into the kitchen,\" I said. \" Go in there. Now, who is there 1 \"\n\" Oh,\" he said, \"there's Mary Doyle and another girl.\"\nMary Doyle was a girl from the village of Kilmarow, whom he knew very\nwell, though he could not have seen her for some months, as she had been\nfor a considerable time cook in that house. The distance between my room\nin the mill and this house on the Newtown road was not less than five miles.\nI had selected this house that I might be certain of his going into it, as his\nseeing this girl would afford me evidence of this, and now finding that he\nhad reached the right house, I told him to go upstairs and tell me who were\nin the parlour.\nHe told me that sitting round a table in the parlour were a lady of middle\nage, who wore a cap, and three young ladies, one of whom wore a very queer\nkind of headdress, which came round her face and under her chin, covering\nthe lower part of the face and also concealing her hair. Further, he saw a\nsmall boy, and a lad, who was reading.\nThis description was to me satisfactory as representing what I should\nexpect, save as to two points. I could not think of any lad as likely to be\nin the house, and I could by no means understand the queer headdress of\nthe young lady. As, however, I was so far satisfied that the man could not\nhave obtained what he had told me by reading my thoughts, and as I did not\nthink it quite justifiable to pry needlessly into my friends' affairs, I recalled\nthe man, and shortly afterwards wakened him and sent him on to his work.\nBeing in Waterford next day, I met the lady of the house to which I had\nsent the man on the previous evening, and on asking how they were at home,\nshe replied :\u2014\" Very well, but poor E. has been suffering from toothache,\nand had her face tied up all last evening,\" adding, \"W. came down quite\nunexpectedly from the school, and spent yesterday evening with us.\" Even\nhad I not obtained this information unasked for, I should hardly have liked\nto let this lady know that I had sent such a messenger to see her family in\nthis way. The time was about 6 o'clock, or between that and seven, and the\nprobability was that the lad would not have left the school before 5 o'clock.\nHis coming home was unknown to anyone in his mother's house till he\narrived there, and in any case it would not have been possible for the man,\nwho was in his own house five miles off, to have had any communication with\nanyone save it had been through some of my own family. Moreover, he was\nignorant even of the name of any member of the lady's family and had never\nknown any of them. Although he knew the servant, whom he at once\nrecognised, he did not know when awake where she was, save that she was\nin service somewhere in or about Waterford. Again, if the very improbable\nevent had occurred of any person from the village having been to the house\nmentioned to see Mary Doyle, such an event would at once have become\ncommon gossip in the village, and I should have heard it speedily. Apart\nfrom any such considerations, the man could beforehand have had no idea of\nthe place whither I sent him, and in his waking state would have required.\nH\n\f98 Mrs. H. Sulgwick.\ninformation as to locality and names had I sent him in the body with a\nmessage to the house, which was quite unknown to him.\nI cannot find any memorandum made at the time, but I have once or\ntwice given an account of the circumstances as above narrated, which became\nat the time of the occurrence fixed in my memory, which is retentive.\nH. T. Humphreys.\n(M. 320.) [From a gentleman who does not wish his name to bo\npublished.]\nWhen what is popularly termed \"biology\" came into vogue some 40\nyears ago, a near relative, a physician, still living, at an advanced age, made\nit a branch of study. Notwithstanding that he gave lectures upon the\nsubject, he never actually believed in it as a true science or power, although\nillustrating his lecoures by throwing persons into the mesmeric trance, with\nthe usual manifestations. This strange scepticism I cannot account for, but\nmention it as told to me by himself. Among others he was in the custom of\nmesmerising a boy, whom indeed he took with him when invited to lecture\nat a distance (he was by no means a professional biologist). This boy he\ncould mesmerise instantaneously. I never was present at any of his lectures,\nas we lived at a considerable distance apart. Being on a short visit to my\nfriend, and about to leave by the stage-coach at 4 p.m., he suddenly\nrecollected that there was about an hour to spare, and that if he could find\nthe boy, he might be able to show me a case of clairvoyance. We did find\nthe youth with some trouble, and at quarter-past 3 o'clock he permitted\nhimself, but with much reluctance, to be mesmerised. It appeared that he\nalways suffered afterwards. The moment he was mesmerised Dr. B. said to\nhim : \" Now be quick, as this gentleman is in a hurry. Does he live in this\ntown?\" \"No, he lives about 24 miles away\" (which was correct).\n\"Where?\" \" I don't know, but it's in a big town.\" \"Do you see his\nhouse ? \" \"Yes, it's at the top of a brae \" (ascent). \" How many rooms are\nthere in it ? \" The answer was perfectly correct. \" Do you see any people\nin it ? \" \" Only a servant and a child in the cradle. They are in the kitchen.\"\n\" What is the servant doing 1 \" \" She is peeling potatoes, and sometimes\nrocking the cradle with her foot.\" \" Are you sure there is no one else in the\nhouse?\" \"Certain.\" \" Is there nobody in any of the rooms?\" \"No,\nthe mistress of the house went down to the town a little while ago.\"\nOn this, my friend, who had faithfully promised the boy to keep him\nonly a short time under the mesmeric influence, asked me if I had seen and\nbeard enough to satisfy my curiosity and to test the probability of the\nanswers being correct, and on my expressing my satisfaction, immediately\ndemesmerised (is there such a word ?) him, and the lad decamped incon\ntinently, evidently glad to make his escape.\nOn arriving at home in the evening, I made careful inquiry, and found\nthat all was just as the boy had stated. The time was easily fixed by the\nhour at which my wife had gone out for a walk. She had \" gone down the\ntown \" about 3 o'clock, and had ordered dinner at 4 o'clock. At the moment\n,of the boy being mesmerised, the servant was undoubtedly peeling the dinner\npotatoes in the kitchen, and at the same time attending to the baby in the\ncradle.\n\fOn the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 99\nThe story is short and simple, and is perfectly unvarnished. There was\nnot a suspicion of collusion (had it been possible), my friend being a physician\n,of the highest honour, and held in an esteem of which he recently had a most\nremarkable public proof, yet it is sufficient \"to give us pause\" ere treating it\nwith philosophic contempt. By \"collusion,\" I mean that the boy might have\n\"been furnished with the probabilities ;\u2014which explanation is out of the\n,question.\nClairvoyance op the Past.\n(M. 330.) The following account was sent by Mrs. Stella, of Chieri,\nItaly, who was known to Mr. Gurney, and who was the percipient in Cases\n198 and 274 in Phantasms of the Living. Mr. Gurney suggested that this\n.may have been a case of reading of A.'s mind through its affinity to B's, who\nis present.\n\" A short time ago, hearing that there was a ' sonnambula ' in the neigh\nbouring town, I went to ' consult ' her out of pure curiosity, and quite pre\npared to be hoaxed. I was told that she could tell you all about yourself,\nand any other person in whom you were interested, provided you gave her\nan object belonging to that person. I went to see her, and asked for a\nseance. She was placed in a state of trance or mesmeric sleep by a young\ngirl, who, after placing my hand in that of the 'sonnambula,' left the house.\nThe woman first gave me a personal description of myself, nationality, &c.,\nwith a description of character, which was perfectly correct. She even\nmentioned a slight indisposition from which I was suffering, giving me a\nremedy for it. I then gave her some hair which I had combed out of a brush\nin my stepson's travelling bag, he having just arrived from Spain. (This I\ndid on purpose, in order to puzzle her.) She took the hair in her hand,\nplacing it on her forehead, and at the same time leaving her hold on my\nhand. At first she was puzzled and confused, but soon her ideas seemed\nto become more distinct, and then she told me his relationship to myself,\ngiving an exast personal description of his appearance, character, &c. She\ndid not call him my stepson, but ' a close relation without consanguinity.'\nI then asked her where he lived, what he did, &c. She told me all, even to\nunimportant details. For instance, she said, ' Yesterday, he rode into the\ncountry, got off his horse, and bought some cigars. The tobacconist could\nnot give him change, so seeing two friends passing, my son asked them to\nchange the note.' I knew nothing of this, but asked my boy when I\nreturned home, and found it true.\n\" I was certainly astonished, and my disbelief is shaken. All the answers\nwere not very clear, but if I expressed any dissent she got confused, so I\nfound it best to let her answer my questions her own way. Some of the\ndetails are most curious, and the fact of the hair having been to Spain was\nmentioned by her, and at first caused her some confusion, and she became\ndistressingly irritated at not being able to ' see ' clearly. On her return to\nconsciousness she appeared exhausted, and professed a total ignorance of\nwhat had been asked her.\n\"I can give no suppositions on the matter, and only state what I\nwitnessed.\"\n\f100 Leon Marillier.\nIV.\nAPPARITIONS OF THE VIRGIN IN DORDOGNE.\nBy Leon Marillier.\n(Translation revised by the author.)\nIn the summer of 1889 there appeared in the Department of the\nDordogne a sort of epidemic of hallucinations. The newspapers of\nthe district, and in particular VEcho de la Dordogne, concerned them\nselves with these apparitions of the Virgin because it seemed that they\nmight be used as arguments in political and religious controversies.\nThey gave rise to endless discussions between Conservatives and'\nRepublicans, between Catholics and Freethinkers ; but it hardly\noccurred to anyone to deal with the matter scientifically. For this\nreason it is impossible to trust entirely the accounts of the newspapers..\nThe Echo de la Dordogne, however, contains some definite and interest\ning information which agrees with what I actually heard in September,\n1889, from the mouths of the little girls who first saw the apparition,\nand of the priests who followed the affair from the beginning.\nTo my mind the interest of these apparitions consisted not in the\nvisions themselves, which, according to the accounts current in the\ndistrict, were like all visions of mystics, but in their contagious\ncharacter. Many epidemics of hallucinations have been observed (that\nat Corano, in Italy, in 1885, being one of the most recent), and their\ngeneral characteristics are pretty well known, but it has not been\ndetermined, by critical examination of particular cases, how much is\ndue in these phenomena to verbal suggestion, and how much to true\ninfection. This is what led me to study these apparitions in detail.\nA little girl of 11 years of age was the first to see the Virgin.\nHer hallucination was transmitted, in the first place, to other children\nof her own age, and then to a large number of peasants, both men\nand women. Grown men and children alike saw the apparition, but\nthey all saw it under a slightly different form. The central fact of\ntheir stories is the same, but the details vary. The Virgin is sometimes\nin white, sometimes in black ; sometimes she has her face bare, and\nsometimes she is wrapped in a veil ; occasionally her body is luminous,\nor she carries lights attached to her shoulders or to her breast. Some\ntimes she is large, sometimes small, scarcely as tall as the plaster\nstatuettes which are found on the mantel-piece of every peasant's house\nin Pdrigord. The surroundings also change. Sometimes the Virgin\nappears upon the lande as a vague, ill-defined form, which passes as\n\fApparitions of the Virgin in Dordogne. 101\nthough wrapped in the mist. Sometimes, on the other hand, to one\nwho looks between the stones heaped up at the foot of the hazel tree,\nwhere she first revealed herself, she appears all resplendent with golden\nlight, in a chapel of gold, illuminated by the light of wax candles.\nIt will be useful, for the right understanding of the character of\nthese hallucinations, to describe shortly the district in which they took\nplace, and in particular the spot where the Virgin appeared. The\nlittle seer 1 lives some miles from PeYigueux, in a country of low, stony\nhills, where grow great branching chestnut trees, and oaks with black\ntrunks. The red tinge of the soil appears through the scanty herbage,\nunder the pitiless light of the blue sky. Mournful heaths, covered\nwith fine herbs, studded with thickets, and cut up by small half-ruinous\nwalls, stretch over the low hills between the silent woods. Sheep are\nfeeding here and there, tended by a little girl who sits at the foot of\n,a thicket of hazel or holly. However far one looks, one sees hills\nbehind hills stretching to the horizon. There is nothing to arrest the\neyes or to fix the thought in this indefinite and vague landscape, in\nthese undulating woods, which grow blue in the distance like a silent\nsea. Nothing is heard but the strong voice of the wind which blows\nunceasingly at the top of the hills, and in the bottoms of the valleys,\nwhich are filled with tall vegetation, the sound of the streams con\ntinually turning the mill-wheels. The farms are built on the skirts of\nthe meadows, at the foot of the woods which rise towards the sky ; the\nvillages stretch along the river ; and on the smooth waste beyond the\nwoods, where the heather grows, there is a deep calm, a solitude\ndisturbed only by the browsing of the sheep, and the short bark of the\ndogs, answering one another from farm to farm.\nIt is in the midst of this mild and mournful country that the\nVirgin appeared on the heath of Pontinet. On a hot summer after\nnoon I went to the new sanctuary\u2014a few stones piled up by the side of\na bush. On a piece of land, which is half field and half heath, where\ngrey herbage grows with difficulty among the stones, the peasants are\ncoming and going with a solemn air, looking rather grave and frightened.\nAt the end of the field is a wall of old stones, loose and crumbling,\nand pierced by deep holes. Behind the wall oaks have grown scantily\nupon the red soil, and a stunted hazel tree has emerged from a heap of\nstones. A tent has been made with a white cloth and four sticks, and\n, there, on the boards, are spread out rosaries, holy images, and a\nthousand little objects which have been brought to the holy Virgin for\nher blessing. These rosaries are placed upon the wall, and are thus\nsanctified ; and it is said that those which have already been blessed\nseparate themselves from the others.\n1 Seer is used, for lack of a better word, to translate voyante.\n\f102 Leon MarilUer.\nA family is sitting in the little wood beside the heath\u2014pious, but\nsceptical people, who look with a mocking eye upon the women in\nwhite caps or in many-coloured muslins, who are prostrating them\nselves, moved and serious, at the foot of the old wall by the hazel\nthicket. A little girl, Marie Roussary(14 years of age), puts her head\ninto a hole in the wall in order to see the Virgin, whom she has come\nto seek for a week past, and has not yet found. She is stretched out\nat full length upon the ground, and her body is agitated by convulsive\nmovements. She groans, and wrings her hands. Suddenly she sees\nat the bottom of the hole in the wall a golden chapel, and in the\nchapel there is the Virgin with the Child in her arms, and all about her\nare flying angels, clothed in light. The child gazes in ecstasy. \" Oh,\nhow fine she is ! How pretty our Lady is ! \" It is necessary almost to\ntear her away from the wall. Then follows a woman (Anna\nBarbansais), who approaches the wall devoutly, and looks into the\ndark hole. At the bottom of the hole the gilded chapel is still shining.\nShe has been coming to the sacred bush for 12 days now, and this is\nthe first time that she has seen the Virgin. One day, however, a week\nbefore, she had seen her when she was passing over the heath at night\nfall. Next follows a grave peasant, with a serious and distrustful air,\nwho, in his turn, approaches the wall, and is soon seized by the same\nvision. He is upon his hands and knees, searching with a troubled\ngaze the crack which penetrates between the stones. He is silent, and\ntrembling all over, and then he announces that he, too, like the others,\nhas seen the Virgin. Has he really seen her 1 or is it false shame 1\nTs he unwilling to confess that there was before him nothing but a\nheap of crumbling stones, without chapel and without God? It is\nimpossible to know. He gets up slowly and gravely, with a serious\nand thoughtful look. When he departs, another takes his place, and\nall, each in turn, approach the sacred spot. All do not see, but\nthose who have not seen depart silently. They are both sad and\nhumiliated. In this manner the peasants come by hundreds every day\nto this corner of heath hidden behind the oaks to find the Virgin.\nThe soil is beaten hard, as if herds had passed over it, and the whole\ncrowd is silent, composed, and grave, and it seems as if a new faith\nand a new form of worship were about to come into being.\nIn the morning I went to the house of the seer. Prom Savignac\nwe had followed a narrow path, which led through the tall grass of the\nmeadows. We saw in a field a little girl, thin and dark, digging.\npotatoes. Near the field, on the other side of the hedge, was a farm\nhouse, with a red roof, and a fig tree against it. We asked the child if\nit was La Varenne, and if she knew Marie Magontier (the name of the\nseer). She raised her large black eyes, burning with an ardent fire,\nand looked at us with a half-smile of her expressive mouth, and an air\n\fApparitions of the Virgin in Dordogne. 103\nthat was at once bold and frightened. It was Marie Magontier. As\nshe walked towards the house, my companion, M. Verdeney, spoke to\nher in the dialect of the district, but she answered hardly at all, and\nonly in short sentences. She took us into a low room, where a woman\nwas sitting at the corner of a great fireplace, nursing a baby. A tall,\nstrong peasant was standing near the door. It was here that Marie\nlived, in the house of a relation who had taken her in. She stood\napart, leaning against a dresser, and looked at us with a strange and\ndisturbing expression of mocking hostility. She was barely 12 years\nold, but in her motions and in her manner of looking and of smiling\nthere was a penetrating grace, which was at the same time artless and\nstudied, a sort of unconscious and crafty coquetry. She was still a\nchild, but she was half a woman, with looks which were in turn caress\ning and forbidding. Her rebellious black hair made a tangle of wild\nlocks upon her head ; her thin, bare legs were sunburnt and covered\nwith mud, and while she looked at us with a strange, absent look,\nher thin childish arms were crossed behind her back. I questioned Marie\nabout her visions, but she was unwilling to talk to me at first, and\nremained silent, putting on the bored and sulky look of a child who is\nembarrassed by a question. One felt that it would not need much\nmore urging to produce an outburst, and that she would soon come to\nviolent and coarse language. She had not breakfasted yet, and the\nsoup which was smoking upon the fire seemed to interest her much\nmore than our questions. She looked at us and then at the door, and\ntwisted a corner of her jacket between her fingers. She did not\nunderstand why we had come so far to ask her questions. She was\ndisturbed and disconcerted, and it seemed that she could not, without\nrepugnance, speak about her visions to people who had not yet given\nany proof of their simple faith and entire confidence in her. \"VVe\nunderstood that we could scarcely expect to get anything from her so\nlong as she had not become familiar with us. The exuberance and flow\nof words of M. Verdeney, and the official gravity of M. Brun, did\nnot put her in the humour for talking, and the presence of her relations\nseemed to embarrass her and to put a kind of constraint upon her ; so\nwe made an appointment with her for a little later, and went to obtain\ninformation from the Cure' of Savignac.\nThe account given us by M. Mestaier, Cure of Savignac, was as\nfollows :\u2014\nMarie Magontier experienced her first hallucination on July 16th,\nthe day of the Fete of Our Lady of Carmel. For more than five\nyears past she had occasionally seen the Virgin appear to her, but it\nwas not certain whether these apparitions were not in dreams. Her\nmother, on the evidence of M. Poujat, Mayor of Mayac, was subject to\nhallucinations ; she used to see in full daylight a form come down her\n\f104 Leon Marillier.\nchimney and advance towards her to kill her. The father was\nepileptic. To this M. Gerard, of Mayac, in whose service the mother\nhad been, could bear witness. The child's mind was filled with\nambitious ideas. She said that she was \"more than the priests,\"\nbecause she talked to the Blessed Virgin and the Blessed Virgin talked\nto her. She kept apart from the other children, did not play, and\nwas deeply impressed with the mission which she had received. Her\nself of a lofty piety, she laughed at received religious practices, and\nbroke out into mockery at the peasants because they took their hats off\nbefore a crucifix. She would not accept advice or counsel from anyone.\nShe said that she was rich, and had no need of money, because she was\nthe friend of the Virgin ; but at the same time she would accept coins\ngiven her by those who were brought to her by her visions. It was\nnot certain that she did not believe herself authorised to take what\ndid not belong to her, when she desired it. She had taken money.\n\" Everyone,\" she said, \" does his business his own way.\"\nShe had lived in the summer in the village of Garabeau (in the\nCommune of Saint Vincent de l'lle), and had been in the habit of\ntaking her sheep to an uncultivated field at the place called Le Pontinet,\nin the Commune of Savignac les Eglises. One day, she said, she saw the\nVirgin appear to her in a hole in the wall. The figure was quite\nsmall, only a few inches high. This apparition made a great noise, and\nshe spoke of it to everybody, and soon others, too, like herself, saw the\nVirgin ; namely, Marguerite Carreau and Marie Gourvat, both living\nat La Bourelie. On August 4th, M. Mestaier examined the two\nchildren separately. Marie Magontier told him that it was Marguerite\nCarreau who had seen the Virgin first, but that now it was to her that\nshe appeared every time that she went to Le Pontinet. Marguerite\nCarreau, on the other hand, maintained that neither she nor the little\nGourvat had seen anything until the day when Marie Magontier told\nthem of her visions. Our further inquiries seem to have proved that\nthey were both right ; that it was Marguerite Carreau who was the\nfirst to experience certain vague and indistinct hallucinations, but that\nthey only became defined under the influence of the definite vision which\nappeared to Marie Magontier on the heath of Le Pontinet. According\nto the Cur4 Marie is a clever and cunning child of a quick intelligence,\nwho has always exercised a sort of ascendency over children of her\nown age and even over grown-up people. She has in the district the\nreputation of being a witch, or nearly so. The wolves do not take her\nsheep, for she has prayers against them. She has readily given advice\non money matters, or on family affairs. She lies down upon the ground,\nwith her head in the crack in the wall, and waits for the answer of the\nVirgin. The Virgin appeared to her dressed in black, and all wrapped\nin veils, because, said Marie, she was wearing mourning for France.\n\fApparitions of the Virgin in Dorclognc. 105\nTt would seem, however, that this explanation has been suggested to her\nby M. Mestaier. The Virgin has a horror of red, as she had told\nMarie several times. In this it looks as though there were a political\nintention, which at first might make one suspect the child's sincerity ;\nbut it must be remembered that the attitude of the clergy, and in\nparticular of the Bishop of Perigueux, has been from the first very\nreserved, and afterwards definitely hostile.\nThe apparitions soon increased in number, and up to August 4th there\nwere more than a dozen. Every time that the seers went to Le\nPontinet they saw the Virgin. Children, women, and even men went\nin crowds to the miraculous wall. The Virgin appeared every day,\nclothed sometimes in black and sometimes in white. She was\noccasionally wrapped in a garment of light, and certain people said\nthat she had lighted candles upon her breast and her shoulders. They\ntold their beads kneeling upon the rough ground of the heath, among\nthe great stones scattered here and there, which Marie compared to\ntombstones ; they sang psalms and litanies, and burnt tapers ; and\nmen and women came to consult the seers and to make inquiiy about\nthe future.\nOn August 11th more than 1,500 people came to Le Pontinet, and\nthe Virgin appeared to a great number of them in the crack of the\nwall. On the part of the women faith was complete ; but the men\ncame half believing and half doubting. If ecclesiastical authority\nhad been lent to it, a new form of devotion would very quickly have\nbeen produced. On festival days tents were erected upon the heath,\nwhere rosaries, statuettes of the Virgin, sausages and other meats,\npears and wine were sold indiscriminately. At another time of year\nthe news of the apparitions might perhaps have taken longer time to\nspread, but August 6th was the examination day for elementary\ncertificates at Savignac les Eglises. There were some eighty children\nthere, and their relations heard the people of Savignac telling about\nMarie's marvellous visions. They spread the news of them in the\nneighbouring districts, and five days afterwards, on August 11th,\nmore than 1,500 people came to the hazel bush where the Virgin had\nappeared.\nAt about one o'clock Marie Magontier came again to find us at the\ninn. She was less shy than in the morning, and was more ready to\nallow us to ask her questions. She had no longer the same hostile and\ncontemptuous attitude, but she seemed still to be uneasy and troubled,\nand she sat in a corner of the room with her eyes obstinately fixed\nupon the ground. M. Verdeney questioned her in patois, but he could\nnot get any answer from her. I then went to her, took her hands, and\nspoke gently to her, stroking her cheek and her hair, and looking into\nher eyes. After a short time she came to me of her own accord, and\n\f106 Leon Marillier.\nafter that she willingly answered all my questions. She told me that her\nmother also had had visions, that she saw her sister appear to her, and\nthat at night she saw lights pass. She herself, one night, had seen her\nmother, who was dead, as a tall white lady, who came close to her. She\nheard voices, and one day the Virgin had spoken to her, and another\ntime she had kissed her. Like her mother, when she was passing over\nthe heath or along the roads in the evening, she saw lights, which\nmoved along in the darkness. One day she had gone to lie Pontinet\nto tend her flock, and had sat down in the shade of the hazel clump,\nwhen it occurred to her\u2014she does not know why\u2014to look into the dark\ncrack which gaped between the mossy stones of the old ruined wall.\nShe saw at the bottom of the hole a figure of the Virgin, small and\nblack, less than a foot high. She only saw her as far down as the\nwaist. Then the black lady disappeared, and in her place there was a\nfigure of the Blessed Virgin, all wrapped up in white veils, like the\nstatues of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, which are to be\nseen on the altars of the small churches in the towns. Soon, two other\nfigures appeared beside the Virgin. Marie was alarmed and went home,\nand next day she came back with a bottle of holy water. The Virgin,\nclothed in white, was still in the hole of the old wall. She threw some\nholy water on the stones and said, \" If thou art from the devil, go\naway. If thou art from God, speak to me.\" The Virgin did not\nvanish, and on another day she spoke to her. Once she saw her\nguardian angel beside the Virgin ; a figure which she had seen in a\npicture hanging upon the wall of the church at Savignac.\nMaiie started with us for Le Pontinet. She chattered all the way,,\nand would not leave me, keeping close beside me and holding my hand.\nWhen we reached the heath we found it crowded with peasant\nwomen. The little seer was like a priest in the midst of the faithful.\nThey surrounded her, and listened to her, and came to consult her.\nWhen we left this barren plain, where we felt ourselves to be far from\nour everyday life, transported into an antique world of the time of the\nvisions of Assisi, we had great difficulty in preventing Marie from\ncoming with us, so unwilling was she to leave us. Had she attached\nherself to us, and to me in particular, with one of those strange\nchildish affections, sudden and passionate, which sometimes spring up\nin young minds, when they are uneasy and perturbed like hers ? Or\nwas she afraid that we should hear ill of her and that we should find\namong the people of the place evidence that she was not sincere 1 I do\nnot know ; but I have no doubt, so far as I am concerned, of the reality\nof her visions. In my opinion she certainly saw the Virgin .in the\ncrack of the wall. She is no doubt subject to hallucinations; but\nat the same time she is ill-balanced, and heavily weighted with the\nburden of heredity. She is the daughter of a father who was\n\fApparitions of the Virgin in Dordogne. 107\nepileptic and of a mother who was doubtless insane, and she has the\nbearing, the character\u2014in a word, all the appearance of one suffering\nfrom hereditary degeneration. She is filled, too, with the morbid self-\nlove and the enormous vanity so common among the degenerated. She\nbelieves that she has a mission, and it is certain that she would not\nshrink from any lie for the purpose of making others share her convic\ntion. It is impossible to determine in what degree she believes in her\nstories. She has no apparent physical defects. There is no lack of\nfacial symmetry. Her mouth is well made, her ears properly rimmed,\nand her face animated and intelligent ; but I had neither time nor\nmeans for testing her sensibility or for examining her field of vision.\nI believe, however, that it was with a degenerated and not with a\nhysterical subject that we had to do.\nBefore leaving Savignac we examined the two other little seers,\nMarguerite Carreau and Marie Gourvat, of the village of La Bourelie.\nMarguerite Carreau is a fair child, very gentle and timid, but quite\nready to answer questions and giving an impression of sincerity and\nfrankness. In the month of July she had, during the course of a\nweek, vague and indefinite hallucinations. She saw shadows pass\nbefore her. Marie Magontier told her what she had seen, and it\nwas then that the Virgin appeared to her in the miraculous wall. She\nwas quite small and dressed in black. The child was frightened, and\nafter some days the hallucinations disappeared and had never returned.\nMarguerite Carreau is the daughter of a well-to-do farmer, and had not\nlived the wandering and almost vagrant life of Marie Magontier. She\ndoes not appear to be, like her, an ill-balanced\u2014a neurotic subject, but\nvisual illusions are easy in this country of woods and heaths, still\nfull of pious legends. The mysticism developed in the child's tender\nheart by the preparation for the first Communion, and her conversations\nwith Marie had done the rest ; but Marguerite's hallucinations never\nhad the same persistence and clearness as her friend's. Her reading,\nalso, may have had some influence, for she had read Undine and\nHoffmann's Contes Fantastiques.\nMarie Gourvat, according to the Cure of Savignac, is a pretentious\nchild, bold and obstinate. She answered all our questions without\nhesitation. She is much more open, more on the outside than her\nlittle friends, and at the same time she is ruder than them and of a\nless subtle nature. Apparently she was influenced by the two little\nseers, and had no vision until the others had talked to her of the\napparitions which they had seen.\nThree times she saw before her a black shadow. The shadow grew,\nand the outlines became defined. It grew clearer and more luminous,\nand at last the Virgin appeared, clothed in white, with a blue girdle\nand a shining buckle. She held a child in her arms, and her feet were\n\f108 Leon Marillier.\nbare. There was in the house of the Gourvat family a statuette of the\nVirgin which was apparently reproduced accurately in Marie's vision.\nShe had also experienced some auditory hallucinations. The\nVirgin had spoken to her, and had predicted the future ; but these\npredictions were very vague and generally referred to family affairs or\nmoney matters.\nAfter the visions of these three seers, a large number of other\nchildren experienced hallucinations. Visual hallucinations predomi\nnated, while those of an auditory nature were comparatively rare. The\nvisual hallucinations have two characteristics, which it is important to\nnotice. In the first place, it often happened\u2014as in a case which we\nsaw with our own eyes\u2014that on the heath of Le Pontinet several\nchildren and several women saw the Virgin at the same time. She\ndid not, however, appear to all of them under the same aspect. Some\nsaw her in white and others in black. For some she was wrapped in\nveils ; for others her face was bare. In the second place it must be\nnoted that these hallucinations were formed gradually, that they grew\nslowly, and that for each of the original seers, and afterwards for each\nof those who believed in the visions, a sort of education or gathered\nenthusiasm was necessary in order that they might see the apparition\nwith full clearness. Generally a little dark figure was seen at first,\nwhich grew larger and brighter at the same time. Marie Magontier\nhas seen the Virgin slowly take off the veils in which she was\nshrouded.\nThus the principal elements of the visions were furnished by the\nmind of each person, by the images which occupied it, and by his\nindividual habits of thought and perception. Nothing was com\nmunicated from outside but the idea of the apparition and its most\ngeneral features\u2014an abstract image, so to speak, a sort of scheme\nwhich each person might transform and modify in his own way.\nRound this central conception the details grouped themselves, and in\nsome cases a long time was needed, several hours or several days, before\nthe new image which thus came into existence could gain enough\nintensity to become objective and to overcome the conflicting sensations.\nThus, properly speaking, there is no contagion. Each hallucination is\nthe individual production of the person who experienced it. In this\nmatter there can be no question of suggestion other than verbal ; and\nwhatever opinion may be held about the reality of telepathic\nphenomena, mental suggestion is here clearly irrelevant. The men and\nthe women who came to the heath of Le Pontinet had for many days\nheard talk of the mysterious visions of Marie and her companions; they\nexpected to see the Virgin, and with all their souls desired to see her.\nIn reality the mechanism which is at work here is very different\nfrom the mechanism of suggestion. There is not in this case an idea\n\fApparitions of the Virgin in Dordogne. 100\nor an image which at once impresses itself upon the mind. The\nhallucinatory image is not like a stranger among the other images and\nthe other ideas, isolated from all that surrounds it. As in the case of\na \" fixed idea,\" and as in the case of ecstasy, we have to do with a\nstate of consciousness which gradually grows, which by its intensity\nthrows into the background, attenuates and enfeebles the other states\nof consciousness, but which remains in connection with them. The ego\nretains its unity and imposes its form upon the foreign idea which has\ncome from outside, and which for a moment entirely absorbs it.\nIt must be remembered, however, that, ordinarily, hallucinations and\nillusions have a definitely individual' character, that they rarely affect\nseveral persons at the same time, and that, even when they do, they\nare generally limited to a small group of persons placed under identical\nor at any rate very similar conditions of life. Here, on the contrary,\npeasants and peasant-women, whose minds, I admit, do not differ\ngreatly one from another, who have the same beliefs, the same super\nstitions, and the same habits of thought, but who are not acquainted\nwith one another and do not live together, experience during a certain\nperiod hallucinations which in their general character are very like one\nanother, and in some cases are actually simultaneous hallucinations.\nIf telepathic phenomena were admitted as facts of nature it would\nperhaps be right to consider the action of the minds of the seers upon\nthe minds of the men and women who saw the Virgin appear to them\nas the cause, not necessarily of the hallucinations themselves, but of the\nspecial mental state which allowed them to be produced and to develop.\nIt appears to me, however, that it is better to have recourse to a\nmore simple explanation. We notice first that the hallucinations with\nwhich we are dealing are for the most part visual ; and that auditory\nhallucinations, when they occur, are determined by the visual halluci\nnations. Among these visions we must separate two distinct classes.\nIn the one we must place the apparitions of the Virgin in the crack of\nthe wall ; and in the other the apparitions on the heath, in the fields,\nor on the roads. The hallucinations of the latter kind are exceptional..\nThey were hardly ever experienced but by those who had already seen\nthe Virgin in the wall ; or else they were of a confused and vague\ncharacter which separates them clearly from the visions of the other\nclass. It is extremely probable that no attention would have been\npaid to them if they had not coincided with the marvellous apparitions\nof Le Pontinet. It seems to me that the visions seen in the crack of\nthe wall may be brought into connection with the hallucinations a\npoint de repere 1 which have been studied by MM. Binet and Fere.\n1 That is, hallucinations formed upon an external nucleus, \" gathering-point,\nhallucinations,\" as we may call them.\n\f110 Lion Marittier.\nThese hallucinations are, in truth, only a special form of illusions. The\npoint of departure is a real sensation round which images are grouped\n.\u00ab,nd crystallised. Hallucinations of this type are much less rare than\nhallucinations of purely central origin. I believe that it is possible to\n.explain in this manner the epidemic of hallucinations in question. Around\na real sensation, which is the same for all, are grouped certain images\nwhich have a strong resemblance to one another and a tendency to become\nobjective. No clear visual sensation can conflict with these images and\ndestroy them while the subject is looking into the hole. Thus they\ndevelop, grow, and at length become externalised. The images only\ndiffer in detail, and thus all the visions have a common foundation\nand only differ in secondary characteristics.\nThis interpretation is confirmed by the fact that when the subject\ngoes away from the wall, or even ceases to look into the crack, the\nvision disappears. I would add, also, that the congested condition of\nthe brain, determined by the position of the head, may play a certain\npart in the genesis of the apparitions.\nIt will be seen that in the phenomena which we have been studying\nit is verbal suggestion that played the principal part ; if \" infection \"\nexercised any influence it was at any rate only secondary, and at best\nonly engendered a state favourable to the appearance of the hallucina\ntions. If cases exist where several people have seen an apparition\nsimultaneously without any verbal suggestion at all, these cases belong\nto a different category of phenomena.\n\fsupplement] W. James, \"The Principles of Psychology.\" Ill\nProfessor William James has for some years past\u2014as most of our readers\nwill know\u2014contributed to Mind and to other periodicals a series of psycho\nlogical essays of marked originality and power. These essays, along with\nmuch new matter, he has now incorporated into a comprehensive treatise of\nsome 1,400 octavo pages on \"The Principles of Psychology\"\u2014a treatise\nintended primarily as an advanced text-book for students, but going far\nbeyond ordinary examination requirements, and embracing perhaps the\ncompletest treatment of the subject, from the purely scientific side, which\nany single work in our language contains.\nSome notice of such a treatise may fitly appear in our Proceedings; yet I\nshall not attempt to review it as a whole, but shall content myself with deal\ning with some of the many points where the author's exposition comes in\ncontact with our special researches.\nThe effort to make this selection involves the somewhat difficult question:\nWhat relation does \"Psychical Research\"\u2014thus vaguely baptised for lack of a\nmore definite title\u2014bear to Psychology in general 1 What parts of Psychology\ndo we touch ? and do all our enquiries lie fairly within the psychological\nThe second of these questions may be answered first. A hundred years\nago, or fifty years ago, our subject-matter\u2014consisting on the one hand in\nminute experiment among strange and bizarre regions of human faculty, and\non the other hand in the collection of testimonies to a class of incidents then\nregarded as either supernatural or fictitious\u2014would have seemed at once too\nphysiological and too superstitious for a place in a dignified treatise on\n\"mental philosophy.\" But during the last generation an \"experimental\npsychology \" has been developed, depending less on introspection\u2014although\nintrospection also is experiment\u2014than on the systematic investigations of\nneurotic hospital or psycho-physiological laboratory ; and welcoming, more\nover, all kinds of morbid or abnormal experiences as an indispensable\naddition to the tranquil self-questionings of the well-balanced philosopher,\nwhich were the principal data with whose study the science began.\nSavants of the experimental school, it is plain, cannot exclude a priori from\npsychology either our subject-matter or our method of treatment, although\nthey may, of course, consider that the subject-matter is unpromising or the\nmethod ill pursued.\n1 The Principles of Psychology. By William James, Professor of Psychology in\nHarvard University. In two volumes. [New York: Henry Holt and Co. London:\nMacmillan\nI.\n\"THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY.\" i\nBy F. W. H. Myers.\nfield ?\n\f112 [Supplement.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nOn analysing that subject-matter, it will be found that we have mainly\nconcerned ourselves with such questions as, while admitting of statistical or\nexpenmental treatment, do nevertheless promise to throw some light, one\nway or the other, upon those deeper controversies as to the existence or\ncharacter of a spiritual principle in man which have hitherto been mainly\nconducted rather on metaphysical than on empirical lines. In this task we\nhave started\u2014as I at least conceive our position\u2014entirely without pre\nsupposition or prejudice. Our research has postulated nothing which need\nprevent its landing us in that \" psychology without a soul\" which is at\npresent bolder and more outspoken than any other creed. And in fact\nmuch that has appeared in these Proceedings has actually made for that\nnegative view. There has been much reduction of alleged supernatural\nphenomena to causes familiar to materialistic science. There has been much\ninsistence on views of \"multiplex personality\" and the like, which are\ndreaded by many minds as destroying the spiritual unity of man. There\nhas, in short, been a complete acceptance of those analytical methods to\nwhich the partisans of the mechanical view of the universe appeal with an\nair of triumph which to us seems at least premature. But on the other\nhand we have collected much new evidence of a positive kind. There has\nbeen what we regard as adequate evidence of telepathy\u2014a power of direct\ncommunication from mind to mind which is difficult to reconcile with the\nordinary materialistic synthesis. There has been evidence also\u2014less in quan\ntity, but to me convincing\u2014of clairvoyance,\u2014of the supernormal acquisition of\nknowledge as to present, past, and perhaps even future things. And there\nhas been evidence which points prima facie to the agency of departed per\nsonalities, although this evidence has also been interpreted in other ways.\nSuch has been our subject-matter in general. As to the standpoint from\nwhich it is viewed, I cannot speak for others than myself. The bearing of\nmy own view upon questions of ordinary psychology will appear in the\ncourse of the present review, in which I must give my merely personal\ncriticism of Professor James's general attitude, and of some of his views in\ndetail.\nWith sound judgment, as it seems to me, our author has explicitly\nabstained ab initio from ranging himself either with the spiritualist1 or with\nthe materialist school.\n\"I have kept close,\" he says (Preface, p. v.), \"to the point of view of\nnatural science throughout the book. Every natural science assumes certain\ndata uncritically, and declines to challenge the elements between which its own\n' laws' obtain, and from which its own deductions are carried on. . .\nThis book, assuming that thoughts and feelings exist, and are vehicles of\n1Professor James, like many other English-writingsavants, uses the word Spiritualist\n(as the French use Spiritualiste)'m contrast with associationist.materialist, mechanical,\nor purely physiological schemes of philosophy, and without reference to \" Modern\nSpiritualism.\" But he feels obliged to use the same word again, with a quite different\nconnotation, when speaking of those who believe that the departed communicate\nwith survivors through \"mediums.\" This confusion is mostawkward, andean easily be\navoided if (as has been previously urged, both in these Proceedings and in some\n\" Spiritualistic \" organs) the term \"Spiritist\" be alone employed in the more\nrestricted signification, for which the form of the word adapts it, and \" Spiritualist \"\nbe left as a philosophic term of more general scope.\n\fSupplement.] W. James, \" The Principles of Psychology.\" 113\nknowledge, thereupon contends that psychology,when she has ascertained the\nempirical correlation of the various sorts of thought and feeling with\ndefinite conditions of the brain, can go no farther,\u2014can go no farther,\nthat is, as a natural science. If she goes farther she becomes metaphy\nsical. All attempts to explain our phenomenally given thoughts as products\nof deeper-lying qualities (whether the latter be named 'Soul,' ' Transcendental\nEgo,' 'Ideas,' or 'Elementary Units of Consciousness,' are metaphysical.\n. This book consequently rejects both the associationist and the\nspiritualist theories ; and in this strictly positivistic point of view consists\nthe only feature of it for which I feel tempted to claim originality. . , .\nI have therefore treated our passing thoughts as integers, and regarded the\nmere laws of their co-existence with brain states as the ultimate laws for our\nscience. The reader will in vain seek for any closed system in the book. It\nis mainly a map of descriptive details, running out into queries which only a\nmetaphysics alive to the weight of her task can hope successfully to deal with.\nThat will perhaps be centuries hence ; and meanwhile the best mark of\nhealth that a science can show is this unfinished-seeming front.\"\nUndoubtedly this is, at present, the most reasonable and the fairest position\nfor an educational treatise on psychology to take up. But the facts and\ninferences thus presented to us with a kind of neutrality will in their turn\nbe criticised from many different standpoints. Some criticisms will be\nmainly metaphysical, and will probably concern the relation borne by\nProfessor James's views to the views of some definite philosophical school.\nSuch comment we need not here anticipate. But even among those critics\nwho appeal exclusively to observation and experiment in support of their\nthemes, we shall find theories at opposite ends of the materialistic-spiritual\nistic scale. My own point of view\u2014at once experimental and spiritualistic\n(I do not mean spiritistic)\u2014can best be explained by first citing some brief\nand powerful statement of the exactly opposite conclusions which experiment\nis with equal confidence (and much more frequently) invoked to support.\nI select such a statement from a recent article by M. Jules Soury on the\nPhysiological Psychology of Protozoa, in the Revue Philoso2}hic[ue for January,\n1891.\n\"Unconscious processes of knowledge, along with motor reactions\nequally unconscious\u2014this is what we discover at the distant origin of human\nunderstanding. This is what we find in the unicellular organisms from which\nthe Metazoa, and man himself, have arisen. It is at any rate our clearest\nresult of observation and experiment upon the properties of living pro\ntoplasm, studied in its smallest particles among the Protozoa and Protophyta.\nBut it will be possible to push still further our analysis of the psychical\nproperties of living matter ; for these psychical properties have at any rate\nno narrower limitation than the limitation of life itself. I hold, in fact, with\nPaul Bert, that the psychical processes in their most elementary form must be\nsought and studied in the molecular processes of particles of protoplasm. In\nother words, it is in the properties of the grains and molecules which make\nup particles of protoplasm that we shall discover the most primitive condi\ntions which the existing world can show us of those very psychical processes\nwhich pass in our own brains, of which we ourselves are conscious.\"\n\"But when this conception is reached, we have the right to infer tha\ni\n\f114 [Supplement.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nexistence, I do not say of a correspondence, or of a relation, but of an\nabsolute identity between every elementary psychical process and every\nmolecular process ; that is to say, between every modification of a psychical\nstate, and of a molecular state, of any organised body of whatever kind. And\nby an organised body, I repeat, we must understand simply a portion of\nmatter whose molecular arrangements are more complex and less stable\nthan the molecular arrangements of the matter which we term inorganic. In\na word, all psychical processes are ultimately reducible to phenomena of\nmolecular mechanics.\"\nLet me try to meet this clear statement with an equally clear exposition\nof my own conflicting view. In the first place, I entirely accept the experi\nmental method here indicated. I make no appeal to any religious, moral, or\nmetaphysical argument. I am willing, if microscopy allows it, \"to study\npsychical processes in their most elementary form in the molecular processes\nof particles of protoplasm.\" Only, remembering that, how far soever such\nanalysis may be pushed, we shall still be studying psychical processes from\nthe outside, I desire that experiment from within should also be pushed to its\nextreme limits\u2014that is to say, to the highest and most complex phenomena\nof psychical life. And over against the purely chemical attractions and\nreactions which M. Soury discovers in his protozoa, I claim that at the other\nend of the scale we can set the discovery of supersensory powers\u2014clair\nvoyance and telepathy. Just as M. Soury infers from his experiments that\nthe psychical life of the lower organisms shades insensibly into the molecular\nchanges of lifeless matter, so do I infer from our experiments that the\npsychical life of the higher organisms is not wholly determined by terrene or\ncorporeal evolution, but slides insensibly into the conditions of a life not\ndependent on the concomitance of a material brain. Nay, further\u2014e\" \/iot\n64fiis, 64\/j.is 8* Ta\\rj6q \\eyciv\u2014I will even add that I find the transition between\nthe incarnate and the discarnate forms of life no more improbable than\nthe materialist finds the transition between the crystal and the speck of\nprotoplasm.\nOur point of view thus made clear, we may proceed to detailed criticism\nof such special passages in this long treatise as may directly concern us.\nAfter a brief discussion of the scope of Psychology, the book opens with\nthe needful anatomical exposition of the functions of the brain, and the con\nditions of brain-activity.\nOne conclusion needs comment here, as bearing on the wide question of\nthe degree of possible inclusion of secondary or isolated chains of memory\nin the memory which accompanies or constitutes the so-called conscious or\nprimary self. \" We can affirm,\" says our author, \" for practical purposes,\nand limiting the meaning of the word consciousness to the primary self of the\nindividual, that the cortex is the sole organ of consciousness in man. If\nthere be any consciousness pertaining to the lower centres, it is a con\nsciousness of which the self knows nothing.\"\n\" For practical purposes \" this may, no doubt, be true. But the evidence\non which Professor James relies\u2014evidence drawn from experiment upon the\nlower animals, or from traumatic results in man, seems to me to be of too\ncrude and objective a character to decide alone this subtle point. It should\nbe supplemented, I think, by much more of experiment and observation of\n\fsupplement.] W. James, \" The Principles of Psychology.\" 115\nmental conditions under anaesthetics, during recovery from fainting, and\neven during apparent coma. Professor James himself cites a part of the\nfollowing description given by Professor Herzen (Le Cerveau et L'Activity\nGerebrale, p. 236, &c.) of his own sensations during the gradual stages of\nreturn from profound syncope :\u2014\n\"During the syncope there is absolute psychic annihilation,\u2014the absence\nof all consciousness ; then, at the beginning of coming to, one has at a cer\ntain moment a vague, limitless, infinite feeling\u2014a sense of existence in\ngeneral, without the least trace of distinction between the me and the not\nme. One is thus an organic part of Nature, having a consciousness of the\nfact of one's existence, but none of one's organic unity ; one has, in a word,\n,an impersonal consciousness. This feeling may be agreeable if the syncope\nis not due to a violent pain, and very disagreeable if it is ; that is the only\npossible distinction ; one feels oneself live and enjoy or live and suffer,\nwithout knowing why one enjoys or suffers, and without knowing what is the\nseat of this feeling. A great number of facts make it probable that, during\nthis stage of awakening, the extremities can already execute spinal reflexes,\nin reply to tactile or dolorous excitations ; but the cephalic centres are cer\ntainly still incapable of entering into activity.\"\nWe cannot here discuss Professor Herzen's facts ; but there is surely no\na priori impossibility in this assumption of a spinal or cerebellar under a\n,cerebral memory. Such a process would even bear some analogy to that\ndeeply significant fact, the production by hypnotic suggestion of physiological\n-or pathological processes, which cannot be produced by the waking will, or\neven watched by waking observation, so deeply are they withdrawn from the\nnormal or superficial consciousness.\nIn all such points as these we are at present in the stage of early artifice ;\n,we are empirically hitting on methods of extending our sway deeper into\nthat vast sub-liminal region over whose surface we habitually skim. At\npresent it seems safest to press the analogy of our ordinary chain of memory,\nadmittedly subject to lacuna whose forgotten subject-matter may afterwards\n(as in the recollection of dreams) be partially and accidentally recovered\u2014\nand to conjecture that not the brain's life during sleep alone, but all nervous\naction may be so far conscious as to be capable of being assumed into the\nprimary chain of memories, if only we can discover the appropriate artifice\nwhich will raise those submerged sensations above the ever-shifting threshold\nof our awake or empirical being.\nAt present all views on this subject must be equally hypothetical ; and\nthe main purport of my criticism is to reinforce the contention of Professor\nJames himself (Vol. I., p. 273, and see Mind, Vol. VII., p. 206) as to the\nurgent need of further experiment under anaesthetics. This kind of experi\nment, indeed, is perhaps more rarely fruitful than Professor James assumes.\nHaving myself, by mere good fortune, once attained under nitrous oxide to\nthe state of \"impersonal consciousness \" which Herzen describes (and see\nFoxwell in Appendix to Spencer's Psychology), I have endeavoured in\nvain to repeat the experience. Yet the psychological instructiveness of this\nunique sensation is so great that it should, I think, be a matter of course for\nthe experimental psychologist to test fully his own capacity of getting down\ninto that diffusive sense of scarce-conditioned existence from whence the\nI 2\n\f116 [Supplement-\nF. W. H. Myers.\nnotion of personality itself, and the specialised senses severally, seem slowly\nto define themselves, not only as an advance and a development, but as a\nloss and a limitation. Through all these stages let the enquirer pass with\nwhat memory he may ; muUipertransibunt et augebitur scientia.\nI pass on to a somewhat similar point in Chap. V. (\"The Automatic-\nTheory \"), where our author is arguing that the ill-explained phenomena of\nvicariousfunction indicate that consciousness exerts a real efficacy of regula\ntion or choice.\n' 'A brain with part of it scooped out is virtually a new machine,and during\nthe first days after the operation functions in a thoroughly abnormal manner.\nAs a matter of fact, however, its performances become from day to day more\nnormal, until at last a practised eye may be needed to suspect anything\nwrong. Some of the restoration is undoubtedly due to ' inhibitions ' pass\ning away. But if the consciousness which goes with the rest of the\nbrain be there not only in order to take cognisance of each functional error,\nbut also to exert an efficient pressure and check it if it be a sin of com\nmission, and to lend a strengthening hand if it be a weakness or sin\nof omission, nothing seems more natural than that the remaining parts,\nassisted in this way, should by virtue of the principle of habit grow back to\nthe old teleological modes of exercise for which they were at first incapaci\ntated. Nothing, on the contrary, seems at first sight more unnatural than.\nthat they should vicariously take up the duties of a part now lost, without\nthose duties as such exciting any persuasive or coercive power.\"\nSo far as I know, this argument is a new one ; nor, perhaps, are the ex\nperiments on which it is based as yet sufficiently well understood to support\nso important a psychological deduction. I would suggest, however, that it\nmay derive some support from a small and imperfectly understood group of\ncases which seem to point to a somewhat similar independence of conscious\nness\u2014to the persistence, that is to say, of consciousness under pathological\nconditions which would seem to negative its possibility.\nIf consciousness be a mere epiphenomenon\u2014\"a foam, aura, or melody\"\u2014\naccompanying, but in no way guiding, certain molecular changes in the brain,\n,we shall of course expect it always to accompany changes of the same kind.\nWe may suppose (for instance),with Herzen and others, that consciousness is\nexclusively linked with the functional disintegration of central nervous\nelements, and varies in its intensity with the rapidity or energy of that disin\ntegration.1 And ordinary experience, at least within physiological limits, will\nsupport some view like this. Yet now and then we find a case where vivid\nconsciousness has existed during a state of apparent coma ; not merely\naccompanying some sudden shock, nor provoked by some discharging lesion,\nnor even limited, as in Herzen's case, to a vague sense of being, but (so far\nas we can see) tranquilly and intelligently co-existing with an almost\ncomplete abeyance of ordinary vital function.\nIt is mainly in the study of telepathic hallucinations that instances of\nthis kind have thus far been observed. The remarkable case of Dr. Wiltse\n(St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal, November, 1889) is, so far as I\nknow, the only case where such an experience has been immediately and\n1 See Herzen, op. cit., p. 221 and note.\n\fsupplement.] W. James, \"The Principles of Psychology.\" 117\n.minutely recorded by a medical man on his return from a condition of\n.apparent collapse.\nUntil this new field has been more fully worked\u2014until the traces of\nmemory which may survive from comatose, ecstatic, syncopal conditions have\nbeen revived (by hypnotic suggestion or otherwise), and carefully compared,\nwe have no right to make any absolute assertion as to the concomitant\ncerebral processes on which consciousness depends.\nThis problem of consciousness meets us again in Chapter VI. (\"TheMind-\n.stuff Theory\"), in the form of a discussion of the familiar question, \" Can\nstates of mind be unconscious 1 \" And here Professor James strikes the\nright note when, in reply to the argument that \"secondarily automatic\"\nperformances \"must consist of unconscious perceptions, inferences, and\nvolitions, \" he suggests that the consciousness of these actions exists, but is\nsplit off from the rest of the consciousness of the hemispheres.\nBut surely it is not enough to press this point with reference merely to\n,those actions which, like expert piano-playing, from being consciously willed\nhave become automatic. .Rather, as I think, we are led to a definition of\n-consciousness simple enough in itself, and in whose light many of the habitual\n,disputations are seen to be purely verbal.\nTo describe a sensation or movement as conscious is\u2014I venture to suggest\n\u2014in effect merely to assert that that sensation or movement is capable of\nbeing comprehended in some chain of memory. That chain may be the\nprimary one which in common speech we identify with ourselves, or it may\nba a secondary one, either spontaneous or artificially created. A dream, for\ninstance, is a spontaneous secondary mnemonic chain ; the sleep-waking trance\n, of the hypnotic subject is an artificial one. Suppose that I dreamt a hundred\ndreams last night, and remember one only, in the midst of which I chanced\nto be awakened. Were those other dreams \"unconscious perceptions\"\nbecause I can truly affirm that I, as I conceive myself, passed the night in\nprofound unconsciousness ? Not so ; these dreams also were conscious, for\nthe ninety and nine which remained in the wilderness of subliminal cerebra\ntion were as capable as the hundredth of being brought home, so to say, on\nthe shoulders of the primary self\u2014of being comprehended in that principal\n,chain of memories which alone lies above the threshold of waking life.\nAgain : only a few years ago it was maintained by Despine and others\nthat all a man's acts in the hypnotic trance were \" unconscious.\" Few\nwould now maintain this ; partly because we have grown more familiar with\n-artifices by which the entranced person may be made to remember or to\nrecord his acts, after his awakening (Delboeuf, Gurney, &c), and partly\nbecause subjects have now been kept so long (two years in one case) in the\nhypnotic trance, with no apparent loss of rationality, that it would seem\n,absurd to maintain that during all that period they had been more of automata\nthan their neighbours.\nYet if this be so, if the acts of the hypnotic trance are potentially as \"con\nscious\"\u2014as capable of recollection\u2014as the acts of waking hours, some start\nling consequences will ensue. It will follow (as already hinted) that we need\nnot despair of comprehending under normal memory certain organic processes\nwhich the hypnotic self can carry through\u2014the formation of a blister, for\n\fF. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.\ninstance,\u2014processes whose mechanism has always lain wholly outside the\nnormal memory.\nBizarre though such a conception may seem, it becomes less strange if we\nobserve the great difference in the amount of the lower organic processes,\nwhich different persons can in normal states perceive, or even partly regulate,\nin the act of functioning. The better we realise these differences, the more\naverse shall we be to predicting to what depth into our cellular being such\nperception may be pushed by those artifices of hypnotic trance, automatic\nwriting, &c, which we are only just learning to employ. Who, even now\u201e\ncan maintain that there is any true psychological line of distinction between\nthose processes which happen to rise above the threshold of our ordinary\nconsciousness\u2014which become super-liminal\u2014and those processes which,\nhappen to remain sub-liminal throughout our whole bodily life 1 That\nthreshold is itself, perhaps, the mere result of the survival of the fittest, and.\nonly marks off those vital processes which it was most important for our\nancestors to be aware of from those vital processes which they could with,\ncomparative safety ignore.\nProfessor James's discussion of consciousness leads on to the central'\npsychological difficulty of stating intelligibly the connection between mind\nand brain. For his own part, and for the purposes of purely scientific, as.\nopposed to metaphysical, psychology, he feels justified in evading that diffi\nculty by a mere statement of \" the empirical law of concomitance.\"\n\"The consciousness, which is itself an integral thing not made of parts,.\n' corresponds ' to the entire activity of the brain, whatever that may be, at\nthe moment. This is a way of expressing the relation of mind to brain\nfrom which I shall not depart during the remainder of this book, because it\nexpresses the bare phenomenal fact with no hypothesis, and is exposed to m>\nsuch logical objections as we have found to cling to the theory of ideas in.\ncombination.\"\nBy thus using the total consciousness of the moment as a kind of\npsychological unit, Professor James is able to discuss many problems with\nthe least possible encumbrance of a metaphysical kind. But obviously the\nunit is selected as a convenience in calculation, rather than as expressing\nultimate fact. The total consciousness of the moment is a function of some\nthing or other, rather than an independent entity. We must look for our\nveritable unit either below or above ; either in the atoms of mind-stuff from\nwhich we may imagine the complex consciousness to be upbuilt, or in the soul,\nof whose existence each moment's consciousness will form a transitory phase.\nProfessor James's view, the determination of such a unit\u2014mind-dust\nor soul\u2014is not necessary to a scientific psychology. But, with this proviso,\nhe briefly reviews the various theories, and among conflicting difficulties\ndecides that in his own personal view the theory of a soul, or controlling\nspiritual agent, is the least inconceivable.\n\"If there be such entities as souls in the universe, they may possibly be\naffected by the manifold occurrences that go on in the nervous centres. To\nthe state of the entire brain at a given moment they may respond by inward1\nmodifications of their own. . . . The soul would be thus a medium upon\nwhich the manifold brain processes continue their effects. Not needing to con\nsider it as the ' inner aspect' of anyarch-molecule or brain cell, we escape\n\fsuppiement.1 W. James, \"The Principles of Psychology.\" 119\nthat physiological improbability ; and as its pulses of consciousness are unitary\nand integral affairs from the outset, we escape the absurdity of supposing\nfeelings which exist separately and then ' fuse together' by themselves. The\nseparateness is in the brain-world, on this theory, and the unity in the\nsoul-world ; and the only trouble that remains to haunt us is the metaphysical\none of understanding how one sort of world or existent thing can affect or\ninfluence another at all. This trouble, however, since it also exists inside of\nboth worlds, and involves neither physical improbability nor logical contra\ndiction, is relatively small. \"\nOur author, however, is careful not to postulate a soul in any further\nargument, but to leave it as a hypothesis (I repeat) lying outside experi\nmental or naturalistic psychology, and mainly useful as a means of showing\nprecisely under what limitations the data with which Psychology works can\nbe used as though they were really valid.\nIn Chapter X., on \"The Consciousness of Self,\" he returns to this\nsubject :\u2014\n\" It is, in fact, with the word Soul as with the word Substance in general.\nTo say that phenomena inhere in a Substance is at bottom only to record\none's protest against the notion that the bare existence of the phenomenon\nis the total truth. A phenomenon would not itself be, we insist, unless\nthere were something more than the phenomenon. To the more we give the\nprovisional name of Substance. So, in the present instance, we ought cer\ntainly to admit that there is more than the bare fact of co-existence of a\npassing thought with a passing brain-state. But we do not answer the ques\ntion, ' What is that more ? ' when we say that it is a ' Soul ' which the brain-\nstate, affects. This kind of more explains nothing ; and when we are once\ntrying metaphysical explanations we are foolish not to go as far as we can.\nFor my own part, I confess that the moment I become metaphysical and try\nto define the more, I find the notion of some sort of an anima mundi thinking\nin all of us to be a more promising hypothesis, in spite of all its difficulties,\nthan that of a lot of absolutely individual souls. Meanwhile, as psychologists\nwe need not be metaphysical at all. The phenomena are enough, the\npassing Thought itself is the only verifiable thinker, and its empirical connec\ntion with the brain process is the ultimate known law.\"\nI have quoted this passage expressly in order to indicate how very far, in\nmy view, the possibility of experiment may extend. The existence of an\nanima mundi seems at first sight an ontological hypothesis absolutely\nincapable of test. We might as well (as one has said) search for God with a\ntelescope as seek the World-soul in the psycho-physiological laboratory. Yet\na truer parallel may be found if we compare the supposed anima mundi to the\ncosmical ether. The anima mundi, or universal consciousness, can be best con\nceived by finite consciousnesses in the aspect of a universal memory, and that\nmemory in the form of a universal record of past, present, and possibly even\nfuture events. Now just as it is possible so to adjust our physical experi\nments that the action of a cosmical ether\u2014although absolutely imperceptible\nin any direct fashion\u2014may seem the most probable explanation of certain\nphenomena directly observed, so also it may be possible so to adjust our\npsychical experiments that the existence of a cosmic record\u2014although itself\nabsolutely incognisable in any direct fashion\u2014may seem the most probable\nexplanation of certain phenomena directly observed.\n\f120 [Supplement.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nNow some of the experiments on trance-conditions recorded in Pro\nceedings XVII. were precisely of the character here suggested. Statements\nwere made by the self-styled Dr. Phinuit\u2014whose existence as a personality\napart from Mrs. Piper is quite unproved\u2014containing facts not known' either\nto Mrs. Piper or to any person present at the time. Professor Lodge's dis\ncussion of these messages will show the great difficulty of assigning their\norigin. Analogous difficulties arise in explaining the source of some of the\ndescriptions of facts clairvoyantly discerned of which this Part of the Pro\nceedings contains some detailed specimens. For past facts are thus discerned\nas well as present ; and moreover, as I should infer from Mrs. Sidgwick's\npaper on \" Premonitions \" (Vol. V., p. 288), it will not be easy, if any clair\nvoyant knowledge whatever be admitted, to deny altogether its extension\nat least into the near future.\nEven if this be proved, we shall still be on the very threshold of our sub\nject. But just as a study of the propagation and interference of light-waves\n\u2014depending on artifices of great complexity- -has made known to us infer-\nentially, yet not the less certainly, an obscure physical entity which .we style\nthe cosmic ether ; so also may experiments on the propagation and interrup\ntions of clairvoyant or telepathic knowledge or memory conceivably reveal\nto us inferentially, but not the less certainly, an obscure psychical entity\nwhich we can best describe to ourselves as an anima mundi or cosmic record\nof all things,\u2014quce sint, quce fuerint, qua mox ventura trahantur.\nDirectly connected with this cosmic problem is the problem of the insula\ntion of the single intelligences thus possibly bathed in a universal psychical\nmedium,\u2014of the ''closed individuality \" of each living man. After a discussion\n(in Chapter VIII.) of the various splittings and severances of consciousness\nlately effected by Gurney, Janet, and others, the author concludes that\nwhatever use we may henceforth make of the idea of an individual Soul,\nwe must in no way prejudge the wider question of the interpenetration of\nintelligences ; the relation which one mind bears to another in the dynamics\nof the conscious world.\n\"One great use of the Soul has always been to account for, and at the\nsame time to guarantee, the closed individuality of each personal conscious\nness. The thoughts of one soul must unite into one self, it was supposed,\nand must be eternally insulated from those of every other soul. But we\nhave already begun to see that, although unity is the rule of each man's\nconsciousness, yet in some individuals, at least, thoughts may split away from\nthe others and form separate selves. As for insulation, it would be rash, in\nview of the phenomena of thought-transference, mesmeric influence, and\nspirit-control, which are being alleged nowadays on better authority than\never before, to be too sure about that point either. The definitively closed\ncondition of our personal consciousness is probably an average statistical\nresultant of many conditions, but not an elementary force or fact.\"\nOur author proceeds to illustrate these words by citing certain alterations\nof memory, alternations of personality, &c, on many of which we have\nalready touched in these Proceedings.1 And then,\u2014for the first time, I\nthink, in any accredited manual of psychology,\u2014we come to a frank\n1 Two of the most striking cases\u2014those of Ansel Bourne and of Lurancy\nVennum\u2014will, we hope, shortly be placed before our readers in a completeform.\n\fSupplement.] W. James, \" The Principles of Psychology.\" 121\nrecognition of the existence and the perplexing character of those so-called\n\" mediumistic \" trances which it would be a mere shirking of difficulties for\nScience any longer to ignore. And in Professor James's temper, surely,\nshould these puzzles be attacked ; with no desire either to minimise the\nobserved facts, or, on the other hand, to set them in any kind of opposition\n*o facts better understood. Here, as everywhere, we must approach the\nunknown through the known ; we must exhaust every existing analogy, every\nTecognised cause, before appealing to causes new to Science, or placing in a\nseparate basket this deep-sea shell which she has picked up from the shore\n,of the ocean of Truth.\n\" In ' medinmships ' or 'possessions ' the invasion and the passing away of\nthe secondary state are both relatively abrupt, and the duration of the state\nis usually short\u2014i.e., from a few minutes to a few hours. Whenever the\nsecondary state is well developed no memory for aught that happened during\nit remains after the primary consciousness comes back. The subject during the\nsecondary consciousness speaks, writes, or acts as if animated by a foreign\nperson and often names this foreign person and gives his history. . , .\nMediumistic possession in all its grades seems to form a perfectly natural\nspecial type of alternate personality, and the susceptibility to it in some\nform is by no means an uncommon gift, in persons who have no other\nobvious nervous anomaly. The phenomena are very intricate, and are only\njust beginning to be studied in a proper scientific way. ... It seems\nexactly as though one author composed more than half of the trance-messages,\nno matter by whom they are uttered. Whether all sub-conscious selves are\npeculiarly susceptible to a certain stratum of the Zeitgeist, and get this\ninspiration from it, I know not ; but this is obviously the case with the\nsecondary selves which become ' developed ' in Spiritualist circles. Thus the\nbeginnings of the medium trance are indistinguishable from effects of hyp\nnotic suggestion. The subject assumes the role of a medium simply because\nopinion expects it of him under the conditions which are present ; and carries\nit out with a feebleness or a vivacity proportionate to his histrionic gifts.\nBut the odd thing is that persons unexposed to Spiritualist traditions will so\noften act in the same way when they become entranced, speak in the name of\nthe departed, go through the motions of their several death-agonies, send\nmessages about their happy home in the summer-land, and describe the\nailments of those present. I have no theory to publish of these cases,\nseveral of which I have personally seen.\"\nDifficult, indeed, must such investigation into the possible influence of\nunseen intelligences in any case be. But it will not be difficult only, but\nimpossible,\u2014it will lead to mere confusion and bewilderment\u2014if it be under\ntaken without adequate preliminary conception of what our own person\nalities, our own intelligences, are in reality and can actually do. The most\nardent Spiritist should welcome a searching inquiry into the potential\nfaculties of spirits still in the flesh. Until we know more of these, those\nother phenomena to which he appeals must remain unintelligible because\nisolated, and are likely to be obstinately disbelieved because they are\nimpossible to understand.\nFollowing our author through his successive chapters, and deferring our\nnotice of the chapter on \"Attention\" until we reach the chapter on \"Will,\"\n\f122 [Supplement,\nF.

Myers.\nwe find in his discussion of \" Memory \" a passage which, while true enough\nof the psychology of our emergent mental strata, is seen to need modification\nif we take into account the subjacent strata as well.\n\"All these pathological facts,\" he says, after enumerating certain\nrevivals of memory, which I cannot regard as all of them morbid, \"are\nshowing us that the sphere of recollection may be wider than we think ; and\nthat in certain matters apparent oblivion is no proof against possible recall\nunder other conditions. They give no countenance, however, to the extra\nvagant opinion that nothing we experience can be absolutely forgotten.\"\nIt would be extravagant, no doubt, to affirm this dogmatically ; but I see\nno extravagance in the conjecture that no lapse of memory can be irrevocable.\nFrom the superficial strata of our mind, we may say, memories slip down\nwards to uncertain depths. But to what depths they sink, or by what\nstimulus they may possibly be recalled, is a question approachable only by\nexperiment,\u2014and by a class of experiments which are as yet in their infancy.\nEven now we have found one artifice after another\u2014hypnotic trance, auto\nmatic writing, crystal vision\u2014alike successful in fishing up from abysses as.\nyet unfathomed much which we supposed either to have been forgotten for\never, or never to have been known at all.\nMost promising of all, perhaps, are the careful experiments in the\ninduction of hallucinatory pictures by gazing into reflecting surfaces,\ndescribed under the title of \"crystal-gazing,\" in Proceedings, XIV. These\nexperiments show that a printed sentence which has come within the visual\nfield, but which cannot easily be supposed to have attracted conscious attention,\nmay be observed, retained, and reproduced as a hallucinatory image by the\nsubmerged self, which may thus send up to the empirical self a message of\npractical value. Is it not safest, with such facts in view, to say that although\nall memories, unless frequently revived, tend to slip from out of the control\nof the empirical self, we have no proof that they can escape entirely from\nthe total or transcendental personality ? So that all that we have been\nmaybe a part of us for ever, and the \"lost days of our life,\" as in the\npoet's allegory, may meet us with undeadened remorsefulness on some\nfurther shore :\u2014\n\" And I, and I thyself,\"\u2014lo each one saith,\u2014\n,' And thou thyself to all eternity.'\nWhere the floating iceberg meets the sea there is no internal line of\nstratification. The proportion of submergence is determined by nothing in\nthe iceberg's essential structure, but solely by the relation between the\nspecific gravities of water in different states. Even so the water-line between\nthe empirical and the subjacent consciousness in man may be determined by\nno break of continuity in the processes which take place within him, but\nmerely by the relation which his transcendental self bears to the material\nworld in which it is immersed. There is no obvious reason why we should\nnot, by suitable inquiry, bring the bulk of these hidden processes under the\ncognisance of the empirical inquiring self. But we must remember that in\nsuch a quest we must not trust to Nature's aid. Nature is propagandist, not\nscientific ; she has fitted us out to use her hidden processes for our own and\nour kind's preservation, not to pry into and understand them with mere\nknowledge as our end and aim. If, therefore, we wish to know as well as to\n\fSupplement.} W. James, \"The Principles of Psychology.\" 123\nbe, we must everywhere replace instinct and sensation by artifice and infer\nence. By artifice and inference our field of consciousness may be extended\nas widely as by instrument and calculation we have extended our field of\nvision. We know already that consciousness is not the trustworthy thing\nwhich it seems, but is a most distorted and incomplete reflection of the\nworld which it professes to mirror. We may now realise on the other\nhand that\u2014distorted and incomplete as our inward transcript of reality\nmust ever be\u2014there is at any rate more of it than we knew ; that what\nwe have to decipher is not a mere manuscript full of blots and lacunae, but\nrather a series of superimposed and as yet undeveloped impressions upon an\ninfinitely sensitive and infinitely receptive plate.\nAnd now we advance to a question more complex still. Whence come\nthe impressions on that plate ? In what way can we distinguish the plate's.\nown blots or markings from the lines and shadings ' which indicate that a\nreal object has been in front of the camera? The practical answer, indeed,\nis simple enough. Whatever impression all plates simultaneously exposed\nreproduce, this represents a real object ; the markings inherent in the plate\nitself will be different for each plate in turn. Objective and subjective\nimpressions, plain men will say, can only be confounded when practical\ndifficulties prevent us from testing the experience of one mind by the.\nexperience of another.\n\"There is,\" says our author in his chapter on \"Imagination\" (Vol..\nII., p. 70), \" between imagined objects and felt objects a difference-\nof conscious quality, which may be called almost absolute. It is hardly\npossible to confound the liveliest image of fancy with the weakest real\nsensation. The felt object has a plastic reality and outwardness which the\nimagined object wholly lacks. Moreover, as Fechner says, in imagination\nthe attention feels as if drawn backward to the brain ; in sensation (even\nof after-images) it is directed forward toward the sense-organ. The\ndifference between the two processes feels like one of kind, and not like a\nmere ' more ' or ' less ' of the same.\"\nCertain experimental facts, however, show that this broad distinction is.\nnot always valid, and \"force us to admit that the subjective difference\nbetween imagined and felt objects is less absolute than has been claimed, and\nthat the cortical processes which underlie imagination and sensation are not\nquite so discrete as one at first is tempted to suppose. That peripheral\nsensory processes are ordinarily involved in imagination seems improbable ;\nthat they may sometimes be aroused from the cortex downwards cannot,\nhowever, be dogmatically denied.\"\nIn thus deciding, Professor James does but reproduce the view which\n(quite apart from any belief in telepathy, &c.) is becoming general among\npsychologists. The cortex of the brain, the seat of our highest faculties,,\nmay itself originate hallucinatory percepts, without any derangement of the\nspecial organs of sense. This fact is, of course, what believers in telepathy\u2014,\nin veridical hallucinations\u2014would anticipate ; and it suggests some curious\nreflections as to the relation between the knowledge which reaches us.\nthrough the sense-organs ; and the knowledge which reaches us in hallucina\ntory fashion, and without any apparent sensory intervention. I will venture\nto explain my meaning by aid of a somewhat homely metaphor.\n\f126 [Supplement.\nF. W. H. Myers.\nsubliminal self in supernormal ways. I have suggested that such faculty of\nknowledge may be innate as well as acquired ; and that observation or\nexperiment may reveal in us traces of an experience which no terrene history\nwill explain.\nI believe that besides telepathy, or the acquirement of knowledge by\nsupersensory transmission from other minds, there exists in nature the\ncognate (or perhaps more generalised) power of clairvoyance, or the acquire\nment of knowledge by supersensory perception of facts or scenes, not\nnecessarily as existing in other minds, but as discerned by an innate per\nceptivity of the clairvoyant's own, exercised in various ways, but mainly by\na quasi-visual\u2014I do not say an optical\u2014act of perception.\nAnd herein our recorded cases fall roughly into two groups : (A) where\nthe periphery was apparently used for jjerception, but used in a way of which\nphysiology can give no account (as where Professor Fontan's subject discerned\nthe colours of wools in pitch darkness, or through glass, and with a screen\ninterposed, but only when he touched the glass with his fingers) ; and (B)\nwhen the peripheral nerves seem to play no part, but the clairvoyant has\ndirect perception of three-dimensional scenes at a distance. Such quasi-visual\nperception, like quasi-visual perception resulting from telepathic impact, is\nattended by striking anomalies, which illustrate what I have called the non-\noptical character of the vision attained.\nIt is obvious that a belief in clairvoyance, if in any degree admitted,\nmust profoundly modify our whole theory of the genesis of space-perception.\nIt does not, indeed, constrain us to deny either that space may be a necessary\n\" form of intuition,\" or that our conception of space may be the result of\nexperience alone ; but it sets back that form of intuition, it removes that\nexperience, to some non-terrene, and perhaps pre-terrene source. It seems\nthat in conditions other than those to which sensory evolution has led, we\ncan conceive, or have conceived of space as real, and are still able, in certain\nstates, to deal with space with a freedom which waking experience has never\nknown.\nOne direction in which a view of this kind is open to searching test\nlies in the study of the conception of space formed by the blind. We\ncould not, indeed, be confident a priori that the faculty of clairvoyance,\nhowever real, could subsist without the existence in the mind of a stock of\nordinary visual images which the supernormal vision might in some sort\nemploy. Yet if, as I hold, there be in us a reserve of latent perceptive\npower, antecedent to sensory specialisation, we shall expect this power to\nshow itself here and there by novel channels where specialised sense is in\ndefault.\n(1) Thus, in the case of the blind, we shall not only be prepared for all\nkinds of auditory, tympanic, tactile hyperaesthesia, but we shall not be '\nsurprised if we come upon cases of vicarious function carried beyond ordinary\nphysiological limits, and analogous to the alleged epigastric, frontal, or digital\ndiscriminations of somnambulic clairvoyance. Just as in cases of cerebral\nmutilation we held it possible that recovery of function, due to vicarious\naction of uninjured tracts, might be such as only a directing con\nsciousness could have effected, so with the blind also we shall conceive\nthat the relation of the organism to the directing consciousness may be a\n\fsupplement.] W. James, \" The Principles of Psychology.\" 127\nrelation resembling\u2014not that of the instrument to the workman who made\nit, but that of the instrument to the savant who experiments with it, and who\nmay put certain parts of it to novel uses which the workman (represented in\nour case by the natural selection which has shaped our terrene frames) did\nnot specifically contemplate, or could not himself have devised.\n(2) Again, we shall expect our supposed innate perceptive power to show\nitself in the blind in all those channels through which the sub-liminal self is\nwont to send up messages to the superficial consciousness. All forms of\ndream and hallucination (whether veridical or falsidical) are thus likely, in\nmy view, to possess for the blind or the partially blind a higher visual quality\nthan their waking perceptions can realise or their waking memories recall.\nNay, I will push the hypothesis to an extremity, and conjecture that the\nblind man will be capable of hallucinations which will be so far from being\nrevivals of memory that they will be such as no memory of his can explain.\nHe will exercise a sight which he does not recognise as sight, which belongs in\nfact to that pre-natal undifferentiated continuum of perceptive faculty of\nwhich telepathic and clairvoyant phenomena show us the vestigial or\nobsolescent trace.\nOn all these points there were much to say ; in spite of the scantiness\nof appropriate observations thus far made upon the blind. But I will\nconfine myself to illustrations drawn from Professor James's book\u2014a\ntreatise assuredly not written to support any such thesis as I am now\nsuggesting.\nFirst, then, as to the replacement of a quasi-visual perception by nerves\napparently unsuited to the task, without aid either from tympanic pressure,\n,or from a sense of differing temperatures. Professor James quotes from Mr.\nW. Hanks Levy, known as a blind man who has worked for the welfare of the\nblind :\u2014\n\" Whether within a house or in the open air, whether walking or standing\nstill,I can tell, although quite blind, when I am opposite an object, and can\nperceive whether it be tall or short, slender or bulky. I can also detect\nwhether it be a solitary object or a continuous fence ; whether it be a close\nfence or composed of open rails ; and often whether it be a wooden fence, a\nbrick or stone wall, or a quick-set hedge. . . . The currents of air can\nhave nothing to do with this power, as the state of the wind does not\ndirectly affect it ; the sense of hearing has nothing to do with it, as when\nsnow lies thickly on the ground objects are more distinct, although the footfall\ncannot be heard. I seem to perceive objects through the skin of my face,\nand to have the impressions immediately transmitted to my brain. Stopping\nmy ears does not interfere with it, but covering my face with a thick veil\ndestroys it altogether. None of the five senses have anything to do with\nthe existence of this power, and the circumstances above named induce\nme to call this unrecognised sense by the name of facial perception.\"\nI must not here go into further detail. Enough has been quoted to\nillustrate the parallel already suggested between the modes of perceptivity\nwith which the directing consciousness\u2014using the bodily frame as the\nsavant uses his instrument\u2014endeavours to replace the special sense-organ\nwhich the blind have lost, and the modes of perceptivity which the\ntranscendental self employs in clairvoyant vision, when the normal opera\n\f128 [Supplement.\nF. TF. H. Myers.\ntion of the sense-organ is occluded by mechanical means, or shut off into\ntemporary abeyance by the conditions of trance.\nI pass on to the second point,\u2014the manifestations in the blind of a latent\nquasi-visual perceptivity, which does not (as with Mr. Levy's \"facial per\nception \") rise above the threshold into the habitual use of the superficial\nconsciousness, but is discernible only in those \" messages \" or intimations\nwhich sometimes reach the upper life from that laboratory of mingled dream\nand wisdom which is ever at work below.\nAnd here the narrative which I must cite from Professor James's book is\nin itself so bizarre, and fits with such singular and, so to say, improbable\naptitude into the chain of my argument, that I would willingly have led up\nto it by many references to the behaviour of hallucinatory percepts occur\nring under more ordinary conditions. Space, however, forbids me to do\nmore than remind my reader that hallucinatory vision has often shown itself\nindependent of the conditions of ordinary vision, and that the subliminal\nvisualising power has proved itself more vivid than the visualising power\nunder the control of the conscious will. The percipient, for instance, will\nseem to see the hallucinatory figure in a position quite outside his possible\nfield of vision ; the crystal-gazer\u2014sometimes (as would appear) even in dark\nness\u2014will see figures evolve themselves which far surpass in vividness of\ncolouring and truth of motion anything which his normal faculty could\nevoke.\nWho shall say, until experiences like these have been intelligently sought\nfor, that even the following incident, which occurred to a friend of Professor\nJames', may not have many parallels ?\n\" The subject of the observation, Mr. P.,\" says Professor James, \" is an\nexceptionally intelligent wtiness, though the words of the narrative are his.\nwife's.\"\n\" Mr. P. has all his life been the occasional subject of rather singular\ndelusions or impressions of various kinds. If I had belief in the existence,\nof latent or embryo faculties, other than the five senses, I should explain\nthem on that ground. Being totally blind, his other perceptions are\nabnormally keen and developed, and given the existence of a rudimentary\nsixth sense, it would be only natural that this also should be more acute in\nhim than in others. One of his most interesting experiences in this line was.\nthe frequent apparition of a corpse some years ago. ... It was a very\nfamiliar occurrence with him while in the midst of work to feel a cool draught\nof air suddenly upon his face, with a prickling sensation at the roots of his\nhair, when he would turn from the piano, and a figure which he knew to be\ndead would come sliding under the crack of the door from without, flattening\nitself to squeeze through, and rounding out again to the human form. It was\nof a middle-aged man, and drew itself along the carpet on hands and knees,\nbut with head thrown back, till it reached the sofa, upon which it stretched\nitself. . . . Mr. P. afterwards traced the whole experience to strong\ntea. He was in the habit of taking cold tea, which always stimulates him,\nfor lunch, and on giving up this practice he never saw this or any other\napparition again. . . . There is one point which is still wholly\ninexplicable. Mr. P. has no memory whatever of sight, nor conception of it.\nIt is impossible for him to form any idea of what we mean by light or\n\fsupplement.] W. James, \" The Principles of Psychology.\" 129\ncolour. ... When he becomes aware of the presence of a person or an\nobject, by means which seem mysterious to outsiders, he can always trace it\nto slight echoes perceptible only to his keen ears, or to differences in\natmospheric pressure, perceptible only to his acute nerves of touch ; but with\nthe apparition described, for the only time in his experience, he was aware\nof presence, size, and appearance, without the use of either of these\nmediums. The figure never produced the least sound, nor came within a\nnumber of feet of his person ; yet he knew that it was a man, that it moved,\nand in what direction ; even that it wore a full beard, which, like the thick\ncurly hair, was partially grey ; also that it was dressed in the style of suit\nknown as ' pepper and salt. ' These points were all perfectly distinct and\ninvariable each time. If asked how he perceived them, he will answer that\nhe cannot tell ; he simply knew it, and so strongly and so distinctly that it\nis impossible to shake his opinion as to the exact details of the man's\nappearance. It would seem that in this delusion of the senses he really saw,\nas he has never done in the actual experiences of life, except in the first two\nyears of childhood.\"\n\"On cross-examining Mr. P.,\" adds Professor James, \"I could not make\nout that there was anything like visual imagination involved, although he was\nquite unable to describe in just what terms the false perception was carried\non.\"\nI must pass on to the theme of some of our author's most striking\nchapters,\u2014the question as to what the conscious will can control, what is\ninvolved in its so-called freedom, or negated by its subjection to inevitable\nlaw.\nAnd in the first place we may fully agree with our author in holding that\n\"effort of attention is the essential phenomenon of will.\" (Vol. II., p. 562.)\nThere is no need to postulate anything beyond this. If our supposed\nagency external to the molecular forces can dominate the attention, its\nvictory is won ; it has its hand on the lever which sets in motion all the\nwork of body and mind.\nIn his chapter on \"Attention\" our author gives clear expression to this\nview.\n\"When we reflect that the turnings of our attention form the nucleus of\nour inner self ; when we see that volition is nothing but attention ; when we\nbelieve that our autonomy in the midst of nature depends on our not being\npure effect, but a cause,\u2014\nPrincipium quoddam quod fati fsedera rumpat,\nEx infinite ne causam causa sequatur\u2014\nwe must admit that the question whether attention involve such a principle\nof spiritual activity or not is metaphysical as well as psychological, and is\nwell worthy of all the pains we can bestow on its solution. It is, in fact, the\npivotal question of metaphysics, the very hinge on which our picture of the\nworld shall swing from materialism, fatalism, monism, towards Spiritualism,\nfreedom, pluralism,\u2014or else the other way.\" (Vol. I., p. 447.)\nAnd now what influence will the views which I have advocated exert on\nour attitude towards this central problem ?\nThey will not, assuredly, tempt us to suppose that we can answer the\nultimate, the cosmic question as to the free or fated pathways along which\nK\n\f130 [Supplement.\nF. W. H. Myers.\neach individual being moves in the vastness of the All. Rather, we shall\nperceive with new clearness that the question is insoluble, that even when\nthe materialist view of man is set aside, the problem of liberty is but\nremoved into a region whither no experiment can pursue it.\nBut so far as the terrene aspect of that problem goes\u2014the question as to\nwhat goes on in man's brain when he wills an action\u2014our effort will be to\nreduce this to an experimental question by correlating it, if possible, with\nother problems which admit of a more direct experimental attack.\n''Effort of attention, \" we are agreed with Profesor Jnmes, ''is the essential\nphenomenon of will.\" The direction of attention one way or the other\ndepends immediately, we must suppose, on the determination of certain\nmolecular movements in the brain. The question of the independence of\nour will (as a terrene cause) resolves itself, therefore, into a question whether\nmolecular movements are ever determined by a cause other than any known\nmolecular force. I leave aside for the present the question whether all\nmolecular movements whatever must not originally, and in the last resort,\nhave been determined by some cause other than any molecular force which we\nknow. I waive also the question as to whether any non-human or disembodied\nagency can ever be detected as influencing incarnate minds, or molecular\nmatter. But confining ourselves to mind and matter as we know them, it is\nplain that there are three ways in which a determination of molecular (or\neven molar) movement by causes outside known molecular forces could con\nceivably be exerted. There may be determination within the subject's own\nmind or brain\u2014which would be the act of free-will which we are discussing.\nThere may be a determination exercised from one mind or brain upon\nanother. And there may be a determination exercised from one or more\nminds or brains upon the ponderable matter of the world.\nAll these three cases will be analogous ; so far analogous at least that the\nmaterialistic objections which apply to one apply to all. When Clifford\nmaintains that \" if anybody says that the will influences matter, the state\nment is not untrue, but it is nonsense,\" we are equally obnoxious to his\nscorn whether we uphold the freedom of the will, or the induction of trance\nat a distance, or the movement of tables without contact when certain persons\nwish them to move.\nI may, then, choose my own ground for the controversy ; and since the\nfreedom of the will seems to me not directly provable, and the telekinetic\nmovement of objects not yet adequately proved, I will select the second\nof the three cases, and will endeavour to meet Clifford's a priori negation by\na proof, not concealed in the depths of our own mental life, but definite and\ncapable of repetition, of the kind of influence which he means to deny.\n\" It will be found excellent practice,\" Clifford observes, \" in the mental\noperations required by this doctrine, to imagine a train, the fore part of\nwhich is an engine and three carriages linked with iron couplings, and the\nhind part three other carriages linked with iron couplings ; the bond between\nthe two parts being made up of the sentiments of amity subsisting between\nthe stoker and the guard.\"\nTo this I reply that in 1885 I actually saw a train of this composition\nmove over a distance of more than one kilometre.\nWhen Dr. Gibert, of Havre, did, at the request of certain inquirers, of\n\fsupplement] W. James, \"The Principles of Psychology.\" 131\n\"whom I was one, and at an hour drawn by us by lot from a bag, entrance\nMadame B. at a distance of nearly a mile, and by an \"effort of will\" drew\nher, without previous warning, to traverse in the hypnotic slumber the\nstreets which led from her abode to his, I then witnessed an operation of\nwhich one terminal portion consisted in the normal action of Dr. Gibert's\nbrain, attending to the idea of Madame B.'s entrancement and approach, and\nanother terminal portion consisted of the normal movement of Madame B. 's\nlegs in response to a stimulus sent down from her motor centres. These\nwere, to use Clifford's metaphor, concatenations of nervous changes as\nmaterial and as definite as the iron couplings which link up the two halves of\nthe train. But what was the influence which passed from one end of the\ntrain to the other ? which carried the impulse from Dr. Gibert's study to the\nroom where Madame B. sat at work ? It was the telepathic impact,\u2014it was\n\" the sentiment of amity subsisting between the stoker and the guard.\"\nI am in no way able, and I am in no way bound, to say more definitely\nwhat kind of influence this telergy, or telepathic impact, may actually be.\nI will not call it (unless for mere brevity's sake) a force or energy ; for we have\nno certain proof that it can overcome inertia or do mechanical work. It may\ndetermine the exercise of pre-existing forces in some fashion to which words\nlike these do not apply. I will only say that we have here, as it seems to\nme, an overt and provable effect of the will on another mind which\nresembles that hidden and unprovable effect of the will on its own mind\nwhich we are endeavouring somehow to come at. If Dr. Gibert's \" will\npower\" could influence Madame B.'s organism, why not suppose that it could\ninfluence his own organism ? Why should there not be another of those\nimpalpable \" couplings \" before we come to the material couplings which\nrepresented the fixed attention of his own brain 1 That transcendental\npower, for aught we know, may have influenced the physician all his life long\nas potently as his patient for an hour.\nAnd yet, as I have already implied, even were all this granted, although\nwe should have proved the transcendental origin of the will, we should not\nhave proved its transcendental freedom. Suppose that a soul within me\ndetermines my choice of bodily actions by suggestions, resembling Dr.\nGibert's \"mental suggestion\" to Madame B., which interfere with the course\nwhich my body, if a pure automaton, would have followed. Yet who can\ntell me that this soul of mine is itself free ? The gods of Olympus descended\nwith mastering energy into the Trojan fray ; but behind them were the\nFates, fixing from eternity the issue of all that gods could do. Who knows\nwhat world-old history, what cosmic law, may now be prompting the very\nimpulses of my transcendental self, and embracing not my terrene existence\nonly, but unnumbered existences, past and future, in one inevitable doom 1\nThe problem is transported into the order of infinity ; we can mark its course\nas it escapes us, but we can do no more.\nSomewhat similar are the reflections suggested by our author's closing\nchapter on '' Psychogenesis, \"\u2014an attempt '' to ascertain just how far the con\nnections of things in the outward environment can account for our tendency\nto think of, and to react upon, certain things in certain ways and in no others,\neven though personally we have had of the things in question no experience,\nor almost no experience, at all.\" He concludes that \" the features of our\nK 2\n\f132 [Supplement.\nF. W. H. Myers.\norganic mental structure cannot be explained at all by our conscious inter\ncourse with our environment, but must rather be understood as congenital\nvariations ' accidental ' in the first instance [as belonging to a cycle of causa\ntion inaccessible to the present order of research] but then transmitted as\nfixed features of the race.\"\nSurely to say that human experience, reacting upon the impressions\nwhich Nature's laws convey, will explain the whole structure of human\nthought, is like saying that the past moves in a game of chess, with the\nknown powers of the pieces, will explain the actual position of the game.\nOf course in order to understand that position we need also to know in what\narrangement the pieces were placed at first upon the board.\nAll the present arrangements of the cosmos\u2014not least its highest known\narrangements, the minds of men,\u2014depend ultimately on a determination of\npotentialities before all human experience, and at the origin of things, which\ndecided that heredity, for instance, should work in this fashion and in no\nother,\u2014 that the forces which build the living organism should dispose them\nselves along these and no other lines. Man's brain is adapted to harbour\ncertain thoughts, as his blood is adapted to harbour certain microbes, not as.\nthe result of terrene experience, or of the survival of the fittest, but because\nthe first arrangement of the kindling fire-cloud was such that all this must be.\nThe original determination, I say, of natural forces was as essential an\nelement in shaping the cosmic future as was the nature of those forces them\nselves. And who shall say what cause directed the distribution of atoms in\nthe primitive nebula t or endowed those atoms with the capacity of evolving\ninto not a dragon but a man ? None can affirm that Soul was not there, and\nwas not all ; and generated the age-long procession of cause and change, ami\nbade the hurtling atoms rain through the unlitten void.\nIllusory indeed is any attempt to simplify, to explain away, these\nultimate mysteries. They must be faced, and not forgotten, when any\nphilosophy approaches the universe with a too readily turning key. They\nmust be faced and not forgotten by those who frankly desire to base all\nknowledge on experiment and observation ; aye, though the experiment\nsuggested, the observation made, should strike on the ears of modern Science\nwith a strangely mystical ring. Which is the mystical, which the scientific-\ncourse ?\u2014on the one hand to ignore these deeper problems, to leave them to\nfaith or to speculative conjecture ; or, on the other hand, to attack them\nwith conscious weakness indeed, conscious inadequacy, but with the same\nweapons which in abler hands have laid many a lesser fortress low ? There\nis no novelty in the suggestion that there is a Soul in man. What is novel\nis merely the attempt to give a precise, an experimental character to this\nold hypothesis ; to define our psychical conceptions by actual observation of\neffects not traceable to physical forces, rather than by any a priori imagina\ntions of what a soul must be.\nSuch has been the leading thought of this review. But in fairness to our\nauthor it must be remembered that the review has been expressly and\nintentionally one-sided and partial in its scope. It would be unjust to\nProfessor James to suppose that a mystical tinge overspreads his treatise.\nOn the contrary, that treatise is distinguished throughout by its adherence\nto the methods of natural science\u2014by its copious and constant reference to\n\fsupplement.] W. James, \" The Principles of Psychology.\" 133\nproved or provable fact. I do not presume to assign Professor James's\nintellectual rank among past or present philosophers. But it is a mere\nmatter of fact that no other treatise in our language contains a discussion so\ncandid and so competent of so great a mass of psychological experiment\nand observation. It is the very abundance of the material offered, the\nfairness of the treatment, which has enabled me from my point of view, and\nwill enable others from standpoints wholly different, to find so much in this\ntreatise on which to dwell. \" Hie liber est,\" one may say, as one ought to\nbe able to say of any comprehensive textbook of an experimental science as\nyet in its first stage of tentative immaturity\u2014\nHie liber est in quo quaerit sua dogmata quisque,\nInvenit et pariter dogmata quisque sua.\nAn experimental science in its infancy ;\u2014such is the impression which\n,we derive from the book throughout. From every page it suggests to us the\nabsolute need, the entire feasibility, of an immense and many-sided exten\nsion of definite psychological experiment. Its students assuredly will have\nno excuse for lingering in the antiquated notion that philosophy is a kind of\npolygonal duel between \"systematic thinkers,\" whose opinions are to be the\nstock-in-trade of subsequent philosophers, until one of these can strike\nout a new system of his own.\nIn every science there must be two main stages, the first, of such\nspeculation as man's unaided observation suggests ; the second, of such\ndefinite experiment as that speculation has in its turn suggested. In some\nsciences the experiment can begin almost at once, and the preceding\nspeculations are soon superseded and forgotten. In psychology, on the\nother hand, the preliminary speculation was unusually difficult and impor\ntant ; nay, much of it was in its nature experimental, and was destined to\nremain as a substantial part of the final structure. Locke and Kant\nassuredly carried psychology further than Thales or Anaximander were able\nto carry physics. But nevertheless, by the mere advance and example of\ncognate or ancillary sciences, a change resembling that which has passed\nover physics is even now passing over psychology. As its biological basis\ngrows firmer, it is developing (I believe) into the great experimental inquiry\nof the coming century, in some such sense as biology itself has been the\ngreat experimental inquiry of the century which is passing away.\nFrom no quarter will the progress of experiments be more eagerly watched\nthan by those who in these Proceedings have advocated views too often\nassociated with imperious dogma or blank obscurantism. All that we desire\nis that psychological experiment and observation shall.be absolutely catholic,\nabsolutely unfettered by foregone conclusions, or by that \"contempt prior\nto examination \" which has delayed so many discoveries a generation beyond\ntheir time. From the boldest and the most faithful interrogation of nature\nour own inquiries, as we believe, can have nothing to lose, and may have\neverything to gain.\n\f134 [Supplement.\nShort Notices of Books.\nII.\nSHORT NOTICES OP BOOKS.\nSehriften der Gesellschaft fiir Psychologisclie Forschung. Erstes Heft,\n(Leipzig: Abel. 1891.)\nWe learn from a prefatory note that the Munich '' Psychologische Gesell-\nschaft\" and the \"Gesellschaft fiir Experimental-Psychologie zu Berlin\" united\nin November last, and formed a German \"Gesellschaft fiir Psychologische\nForschung.\" It is needless to say that this new society will meet with a\ncordial welcome from the English S.P.R., and that we shall look forward to\ntheir publications with warm interest.\nThe present volume of 90 pages is the first joint publication. It is\nedited by Dr. Max Dessoir, whose name is a sufficient guarantee of know\nledge and care. For the next number several papers are promised, of which\ntwo at least should be of great interest to our members. One by Dr. A\nMoll, on \"Rapport in Hypnosis,\" and another by Dr. Otto von Leixner,\nentitled \" Experimental Researches in Dream-life.\" In the present number\nare two papers, both containing matter of interest, though not of primary\nimportance.\nThe first is by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing, a name already familiar in\nEngland. It deals with the importance of the use of narcotics in hypnosis.\nThe author shows, partly from his own experiments, partly from the publica\ntions of Voisin, Wetterstrand, and others, the marked analogy which exists\nbetween the lighter degrees of hypnosis and the earlier stages of narcotism\nand intoxication. In some cases a few respirations of chloroform are\nsufficient to bring about such an increase of suggestibility that complete\nanaesthesia is produced by suggestion alone, and further administration of the\ndrug is needless. It is of considerable importance to know that persons who\nnormally are refractory subjects for the hypnotiser can often be brought\neasily under control by the exhibition of a weak narcotic ; and that the\nsame means will often enable the phenomena of deep hypnosis to be induced\nwhere the ordinary physical procedure does not succeed in bringing about\nmore than the initial stages. The matter has a theoretical interest as well\nas casting light on the relations between natural and hypnotic sleep.\nThe second part of the paper contains the author's main contribution to\nthe subject. He has been making some experiments on the psychical effects\nof hashish\u2014or rather of the Extractum Cannabis Indicw of the German phar\nmacopoeia. In one or two cases he met with great success. The adminis\ntration of 3 or 4 grammes of the drug brought about a condition of extreme\nsuggestibility, without any of the common hypnotic processes. Post-narcotic\nsuggestions were carried out just like post-hypnotic. All the ordinary phe\nnomena, catalepsy, hallucination, hyperaesthesia, analgesia, &c. , were obtained\nwithout difficulty. The effect of Indian hemp, which produces a gradual\nweakening of will-power, while only partially affecting consciousness and\n\fSupplement.] 135\nShort Notices of Books.\nmemory, makes it a particularly interesting agent for the investigation of the\npsychical conditions of suggestibility, and the reader will find it interesting\nto follow Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing's detailed account of his experiments.\nThe second paper, by Dr. Forel, of Zurich, is of a different nature, but\nperhaps at the moment of more immediate interest to the English Society.\nA certain Frau Fay, of Basel, an uneducated woman, was arrested by the\nZurich police as a swindler, and referred to Dr. Forel as an expert for an\nopinion upon her physical state and moral responsibility. He here prints at\nlength the opinion which he gave. She is a woman of 57, who since her\n15th year has been subject twice a day to attacks of involuntary trance. In\nthese she shows all the familiar symptoms of change of personality. She\nprofesses to be controlled by a spirit named Ernst, and in this state has\nbeen in the habit of acting as a medical clairvoyant, and giving advice to the\nnumerous persons who consulted her as to their ailments. Dr. Forel came\nunhesitatingly to the conclusion that the woman was in her normal state\nperfectly honest ; that the trances were not simulated, but arose from involun\ntary auto-suggestion, and that she was not liable to punishment as a swindler.\nOn the other hand, the few experiments which he tried showed no sign of\nclairvoyance or lucidity of any kind. Nothing was observed beyond a con\nsiderable shrewdness in acting on the little hints and suggestions given her,\npurposely or involuntarily, by her patients. Dr. Forel found little difficulty\nin bringing her into a state of obedience to suggestion, and succeeded for a\ntime by this means in curing her of her daily trances ; but he adds in a note\nthat these have since recurred, as he expected would be the case, when she\nhad been long enough absent for the effect of his suggestions to wear off.\nOne cannot help wishing that a little more pains had been taken to inquire\ninto her powers when in the second state. The few experiments recorded,\nwhich seem to be all that were made, are hardly sufficient, in the light of\nrecent experience, to justify an entirely negative conclusion as to possible\nlucidity.\nA still more explicit and welcome recognition of the work of our Society\nis to be found in the preface which introduces Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing's\ntranslation of Professor Richet's \" Relation de Diverses Experiences sur la\nTransmission Mentale \"under the title \" Experimentelle Studien auf dem\nGebiete der GedaiAen Ubertragung.\" The original work needs no notice here as\nit was in the pages of these Proceedings that it was originally published.\n(See Vol. V., pp. 18-108.) The preface, however, contains some very welcome\nnew matter, in the shape of a brief review of the most important utterances\non the subject of thought-transference, to which Continental physiologists\nhave committed themselves. This forms a very convenient summary of the\npresent state of the question, and shows very clearly how the seed sown by\nthe S.P.R. is slowly but surely germinating on the Continent. In France\nit may almost be said to be beginning to nourish, thanks, of course, before\nall, to Richet himself. In Italy it has made a beginning under Professor\nLombroso ; and in Germany Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing bids fair to give it\nthe position in the scientific world which, up to the present, it cannot be\nsaid to have attained. But we must call attention to one important member\nof the European concert which Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing has overlooked\u2014\n\f136 [Supplement.\nShort Notices of Books.\nRussia.

(Paris : F\u00abix Alcan.)\nThe above is the title of a new periodical which is likely to prove a\nvaluable coadjutor in the researches which the S.P.R. was founded to\nprosecute. It aims at forming a centre to which well-evidenced accounts of\nobserved facts or experiments, bearing on the various departments of\npsychical research, may be sent.\nIts plan seems to be in some respects intermediate between our own\nJournal and Proceedings, giving like the former isolated cases of apparent\ntelepathy, premonitions, &c, but including, like the latter, longer papers\ncriticising, analysing and classifying the information received ; also recording\nsystematic experiments. All premature theory\u2014all preconceived opinion\u2014\nall dogmatism is to be avoided. The object in view is to ascertain the facts.\nThe present number contains an interesting introductory letter from\nProfessor Charles Richet to the Editor, discussing the scope and objects of\nthe Annales, an article by Dr. Dariex on the method of observation in cases\nof spontaneous telepathy, four original cases of apparent telepathy, all good,\nand two of them of special interest, and further cases taken from our own\npublications, &c.\nWe can confidently recommend the Annales to our readers, and may\nmention that arrangements are in progress by which a limited number of\ncopies may be obtainable for the use of members of the S.P.R. at a\nreduced rate. In view of this possibility, early application is invited.\nEd.\n\fSupplement.] 137\nCircular No. IV.\nTo Members and Associates of the Society for Psychical Research.\nCIRCULAR No. IV.\n19, Buckingham Street, Adelphi, W.C.\nHYPNOTISM: ITS CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.\nSo many sensational and exaggerated reports of the effects and the\ndangers of hypnotism have recently appeared in the public Press that a brief\nand sober statement of what, so far as our present knowledge extends,\nhypnotism can actually effect may perhaps be beneficial.\nIt should be borne in mind, in the first place, that the hypnotic state is\nnot, in the ordinary sense of the word, morbid. It has many affinities with\nnatural sleep, and in many of the discomforts of illness may be made to lead\nup to it with great relief. Those who are strong and healthy are hypnotised\nas readily, cceteris paribus, as those who are weak or in bad health.\nIn the next place, Englishmen would appear to be less susceptible to\nthe influence than the inhabitants of some Continental countries. Bernheim,\nLWbeault, Ochorowicz, and the Dutch observers place the proportion of\nhypnotisable persons as high as 70 or 80 per cent. , including in these figures\nsome cases where the effects are very trifling ; but the results of English\nexperiments would, thus far, indicate a considerably smaller proportion.\nThirdly, it is tolerably certain\u2014whatever may be the case with Orientals\u2014\nthat a healthy Englishman or Englishwoman cannot in the first instance be\nhypnotised without his or her full knowledge and consent.\nSupposing this consent to have been given, and the subject to have\nproved susceptible to the influence, the following physical phenomena, or\nsome of them, according to the idiosyncrasies of the individual, may be\nobserved : He will fall into a condition somewhat resembling the drowsiness\nof natural sleep, though he may answer questions easily and some of his\nsenses may be specially acute. His limbs may remain perfectly limp and\nmotionless (lethargy), or they may be moulded into any position at the\npleasure of the operator (catalepsy), and may even be made perfectly rigid.\n\f138 [Supplement.\nCircular No. IV.\nThis rigidity may be maintained much longer than in a natural state, and\nwithout the muscular tremor which would naturally occur after a few\nminutes if he were not hypnotised. Lastly, the patient may be made in\nsensitive, in the whole body, or in any part of it, to touch (anaesthesia) or\npain (analgesia), even without losing consciousness.\nThese muscularand nervous phenomena maynot occur in their full develop\nment during the initial stages of hypnotism, or in its lighter forms. But\nthe almost invariable characteristic of the hypnotic state is the susceptibility\nof the subject to suggestions from without. It is this characteristic\nwhich gives the chief value to hypnotism as a therapeutic agent, and which\nforms the source of its chief dangers, real or imaginary. In this state\nillusions of the senses, the memory, or the will, may be imposed upon the\npatient ; sleep may be induced, and pain and nervous disabilities of\nvarious kinds may be removed. But the influence thus exerted by the\noperator may be made to extend beyond the actual period of the hypnotic\nsleep. Pain and physical discomfort may be got rid of for a considerable\nperiod ; the healthful activity of the bodily functions may be assisted, and\ninjurious habits, such as drunkenness and morphinism, may be effectually\nbroken off. The striking results, for instance, obtained by Dr. Bramwell, of\nGoole, in producing temporary insensibility to pain, and by the Rev. Arthur\nTooth in the treatment of inebriety, afford very recent examples of what can\nbe effected in these directions.\nIt is important to remember that hypnotic suggestion is simply an\nexaggerated example of what takes place in the normal state, and can\nproduce only results similar in kind. In a few persons, indeed, presumably\nof an abnormal type, suggestion in an apparently waking state operates with\nequal facility, and self-suggestion is by no means rare. The cases of \"mind-\ncure \" and \"faith-healing\" may probably be attributed to these causes. But\nreports of such cases, unless attested by experienced medical evidence, must\nof course be received with reserve.\nThe memory of what has taken place in the hypnotic state rarely persists\ninto the waking life, and this characteristic offers occasion for the most\nstriking results. Whatever undertaking the subject can be induced to\npromise in a deep hypnotic state he will faithfully perform after waking, and\nwill believe that in so doing he is acting as a free agent. But the liability of\nthe normal and well-balanced subject to be influenced by suggestion has been\nmuch exaggerated. The operator will generally require patience and per\nsistence to overcome even those habits which the subject wishes to be over\ncome. Ideas of an indifferent or beneficial nature will, no doubt, be readily\nreceived, but the moral sentiments, and even in many minor cases, the fear\nof ridicule, will often operate to annul hurtful or ignominious suggestions.\nFrom what has been said it will be seen that, though the probable evils of\nhypnotism have been much exaggerated, there are serious dangers to be\nguarded against. It is indeed by no means a subject to be played with.\nI. It is possible for an ill disposed person to take advantage of the\nphysical helplessness of the subject, or to obtain an undue influence, which\nmay be used to the subject's disadvantage. But dangers of the kind need\nonly be indicated to be avoided. It should be made a rule that no person\n\fSupplement.] 139\nCircular No. IV.\nshould submit himself to hypnotic treatment unless accompanied by a friend.\nIt is clear that no one should place himself in the power of another at all\nunless he can fully trust in the other's discretion and integrity. Nor should\nanyone suffer himself to be hypnotised except for therapeutic or scientific\npurposes. In the rare cases of persons who, through a long course of\nhypnotic treatment, have become unduly susceptible, it is no doubt desirable\nto take special precautions. In such cases a fresh hypnotisation by a doctor\nor other responsible person, and then a suggestion by the new operator that\nno one but himself can influence the subject, has been shown to be effectual\nin shutting out the undesirable influence for a considerable time. The high\nvalue of such counter suggestions in relieving anyone who is inconvenienced\nby the dominance of any operator has only recently been acknowledged, and\ndeserves special mention.\nII. There are also dangers arising from ignorance or carelessness on the\npart of the operator. Of these the principal are : (a) The so-called Cross-\nMesmerism. If the patient come under the influence of more than one person\nduring a single sitting, as may happen with a sensitive subject if merely\nhandled by other persons, a peculiar condition is sometimes induced, of which\nthe characteristics are violent movements and physical contortions, and\nrefusal to yield to suggestions and commands from any source. It is\nextremely difficult to arouse the patient from this state, which generally\nleaves behind it headache and physical discomfort, not removable, as is\ngenerally the case, by suggestion, (b) Imperfect Awakening. It not un\ncommonly happens, with an inexperienced operator, that the subject is\nallowed to depart, at the conclusion of the experiment, before being fully\naroused. He is thus rendered liable to all the discomforts and mischances\nwhich may befall a person not in full possession of his normal consciousness.\nIt is also safer to prevent the awakening from being too sudden. Experienced\noperators are, however, fully aware of these risks, and it may be anticipated\nthat with fuller knowledge of the subject they will practically disappear, as\nit is easy to avoid them.\nIII. Apart from these definite and recognised dangers, there are vague\nallegations of other disastrous consequences to be apprehended, such as the\nweakening of the subject's will, or the degeneration of his character. But\nin the opinion of those best qualified to speak with authority, these appre\nhensions are almost, if not entirely, without foundation. Where hypnotism\nis employed for curative purposes the treatment has proved often beneficial\nand always harmless. Professor Beaunis, for example, has thus hypnotised\na patient daily for six months. And where it has been employed for\nexperiment and demonstration only, the effects on the subject, in careful\nhands, have proved equally satisfactory. The young men and boys on whom\nthe Society for Psychical Research has conducted numerous experiments,\nextending over a series of three (and in one case of six) years, have always\nbeen and remain to this day in full health, physically and morally.\nAppended is a short list of some of the more readily accessible books\ndealing with the subject :\u2014\nHypnotism, by Dr. Albert Moll (Translated from the German).

At the same time they must\nexpress a strong desire that such help should be offered by a greater number\nof persons, The success of the Society's work must largely depend on\nthe amount of collaboration received\u2014on the number of centres of observa\ntion and experiment which can be established in this and other countries.\nI. Phantasms of the Living, Phantasms of the Dead, Clairvoyance,\nPremonitions.\nThe Council have reason to believe that some persons, possessing evidence\nwhich would be of value to the Society, have lately thought it needless to\nproffer such evidence, supposing that the reality, for instance, of apparitions\nat death, was now sufficiently proved, and that no further cases were wanted.\nThe Council wish distinctly to state that their view is altogether different.\nIn the first place, they hold that the value to be attached to the evidence\nalready collected must largely depend on its continuous reinforcement by\nfresh cases of like kind,\u2014observed with care and recorded without delay.\nIn the second place, supposing that the general facts, say, of telepathy or of\nveridical apparitions, were even universally admitted, it would still be a\nmatter of prime interest and importance to discover as much as possible of\nthe latos which govern these strange phenomena, and it is therefore\nimpossible to assign any limit to the number and variety of cases which\nshould be collected and registered with this end in view.\nFor the guidance of those who may be willing to assist the work of the\nSociety by collecting and preparing evidence on such spontaneous phenomena\n\f142 [Supplement.\nCircular No. III.\nas phantasms of the living and dead, disturbances in haunted houses, clair\nvoyance, previsions and premonitions, the Council offer the following\nsuggestions :\u2014\n(1) A written statement, dated and signed with the full name (not\nnecessarily for publication) should be procured from the actual witness ; or\neach of them, where more than one shared the experience. In the latter\ncase it is important that, where possible, the several accounts should be\nwritten without previous consultation.\n(2) Similar statements should be obtained from all persons in a position\nto give corroborative evidence, either as (a) having been present at the time\nof the experience, or (6) as having been told of it shortly afterwards, or (c)\nas having been witness to any unusual effect produced on the percipient by\nthe experience. Where contemporary documentary evidence is in existence,\nin the shape of letters, diaries, notebooks, &c., it is important that this\nshould at least be referred to ; and we should be grateful for an opportunity\nof seeing the actual documents. It should be clearly understood that the\nrequest for corroborative evidence implies no doubt on our part of the\nintegrity or the accuracy of our informants. But it is felt that where the\nmatters testified to are so strange and obscure, the evidence will win more\nacceptance the more widely the responsibility for it is distributed. In such\ncases it may be said that each additional witness multiplies by his own\ntestimony the value of the testimony given by his fellow-witnesses.\n(3) It is further requested that all dates and other details may be given\nas accurately as possible ; and that, where the experience relates to a death,\nthe full name of the deceased may be given, together with that of the\nlocality in which he died, in order that the occurrence of the death as stated\nmay be independently verified.\n(4) Lastly, in all cases where the percipient has experienced some\nunusual affection\u2014such as a sensory hallucination, vivid dream, or marked\nemotion\u2014he should be requested to state whether he has had any similar\nexperience on any other occasion, whether coincidental or not.\nHallucination in this connection, it should be understood, signifies any\nimpression made on the senses which was not due to any external physical\ncause.\nII. Census of Hallucinations.\nIndependently of the investigation above referred to into phenomena\nwhich apparently have relation to external events, an inquiry is being con\nducted by the Society into the phenomena of casual hallucinations, with the\nview of ascertaining their relative frequency and the laws of their occurrence.\nThe inquiry is of the utmost importance, not merely from the point of view\nof general psychology, but in particular in its bearing on our published\nevidence as to the occurrence of coincidental hallucinations. Any person\nwilling to aid in this investigation is requested to communicate with Professor\nSidgwick, Cambridge, from whom the necessary forms can be obtained.\nIntending informants should in all cases be assured that no name or\nother particulars will be published without the express permission of the\npersons concerned. On this subject see Circular V., enclosed herewith.\n\fSupplement.] 143\nCircular No. III.\nIII. Experiments in Thought-transference, Automatic Writing,\nCrystal Vision, tlx.\nThe experiments in thought-transference given in the Journal for\nDecember, 1887, &c, and the experiments in automatic writing and crystal\nvision published of late, may serve to show with how little of preparation or\ntrouble (provided the work be done with complete good faith and care)\nresults of value may be attained. Experiments in hypnotism require more\ncaution ; but here Mr. G. A. Smith, an experienced hypnotist, with whose\nname readers of the Proceedings have long been familiar, will be glad to give\nadvice or instruction. Persons willing to experiment in any of these\ndirections should communicate with one of the Hon. Secretaries of the\nSociety, Mr. F. W. H. Myers, Leckhampton House, Cambridge, or Mr. Frank\nPodmore, 12, Millbank-street, Westminster, S.W.1 One of these gentlemen\nwill also be happy to call on members or their friends who may desire to\ncommunicate information by word of mouth on any of the subjects with\nwhich the Society deals. The Council wish it to be distinctly understood\nthat they solicit information not only on those points (such as apparitions at\ndeath) on which much evidence has already been forthcoming, but also on\nother points included within the range of their investigations, especially the\nso-called physical phenomena of Spiritualism. On this subject Professor\nBarrett, 6, De Vesci-terrace, Kingstown, Dublin, the Hon. Secretary of the\nCommittee established by the late President, Professor Balfour Stewart,\nwill be glad to receive communications, or accounts of cases in or near\nLondon may be sent to Mr. F. W. H. Myers for immediate investigation.\nIn conclusion, the Council would remind the members of the Society that\nthey have, from its first inception, foreseen and announced that an inquiry\nso novel, complex, and important must of necessity be a prolonged one,\nneeding the combined efforts of many persons over a space of many years.\nWhile attaching great value to the results already published, the Council\nfeel that those who sympathise with their object must be invited to fresh\nexertions, if a progress at once rapid and durable is to be made in a research\nwhose very importance and interest increase the difficulty of conducting it\nwith adequate circumspection, and with due minuteness of care.\nFebruary, 1891.\n1 Communications from persona on the American continent should be sent to\nDr. Richard Hodgson, Secretary of the American Branch of the Society for Psychical\nResearch, 5, Boylston Place, Boston, Mass., U.S.A.\n\f144 [Supplement-\nCircular No. V.\nTo Members and Associates of the Society for Psychical Research.\nCIRCULAR No. v.\n19, Buckingham Street, Adelphi, London, W.C.\nThe Literary Committee of the Society for Psychical Research are grate\nful for all accounts that bear on their subjects, even when only privately\nattested. But, while pledging themselves to respect the wishes of their\ninformants as to publicity, they cannot too strongly urge the importance,\nfor purposes of evidence, of publishing with each narrative the name, at any\nrate, of the person who sends it, and if possible those also of the persons\nconcerned in it. In some cases, no doubt, special reasons exist which render\nthe mention of names undesirable ; but these cases, so far as the experience\nof the Committee goes, are a very small minority. And since the mere fact\nof a correspondent's having taken the trouble to send them an account may\nbe held to imply a desire to further their objects, they feel justified in\ncalling the attention of those who kindly manifest this desire to the best and\nmost obvious means for its fulfilment. This means can be no other than the\nmost complete attestation of all the evidence given. Where a person\nrefuses to a phenomenon, belonging to a certain class, the direct testimony\nwhich he would give, if needful, to any other sort of personal experience, the\nworld is sure to take the view that he lacks that complete assurance of the\nreality of the experience which alone can make his evidence worthy of\nserious attention ; and the whole class of phenomena is thus discredited.\nAs for the chance of being ridiculed, or of being thought superstitious, such\nan apprehension is not unnatural, and it commands the sympathy of the\nCommittee ; though they are persuaded that to many of their correspondents\nit will not seem a valid ground for refusing to make aid, offered towards the\nelucidation of an important subject, as effective as possible. But in any case\nthey hold that the fear itself has but little real basis ; and that the subject\nhas already advanced to a stage where courage is hardly among the qualities\nnecessary for its further development. They can, at all events, safely\ndeclare that the necessary attestation has been given by so many of their\ninformants and witnesses, that any others who will follow this example may\ncount on finding themselves in good and numerous company.\nFebruary, 1891.\n\fGeneral Meetings. 145\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETINGS.\nThe 45th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall, on Friday, April 17th, at 4 p.m.\nPart of a paper by Mb.

Myers.\nPart I.\nThe late President of the Society for Psychical Research, Professor\nBalfour Stewart, formed in 1887 a small Committee to consider a\nReport on the phenomena commonly called Spiritualistic.\nThe Committee has collected and discussed a certain number of\nnarratives of alleged movements of objects, without contact, apart from\nthe presence of any paid medium.\nThey do not, however, think that the time has come for any collec\ntive expression of opinion, and I have been asked to prepare an\nad interim account of evidence received (for which account I am alone\nresponsible),with the object rather of explaining the points at issue, and\nof inviting fresh testimony, than of pronouncing on the true meaning\nof the testimony already received.\nA few words of preface seem needed to explain the position of the\nCouncil of the Society for Psychical Research with reference to this\nspecial inquiry. When the Society was founded in 1882, \"Spiritualistic\nPhenomena\"1 formed an important item on its programme for investiga\ntion.- At that time several of us had for many years tested the powers\nof nearly all the paid mediums attainable, with results which were not\nin my opinion wholly unsatisfactory ; and at any rate were not such as\nto make it appear useless to continue the inquiry, if possible, under\nbetter conditions.2 We hoped, then, that the formation of the Society\nmight lead persons obtaining similar phenomena in private circles to\nallow us the opportunity of witnessing them. This hope has been to a\ngreat extent disappointed. It appears, in fact, that, whatever may have\n1 The terminology of this whole subject is in a very confused state. (See Proceed-\niitjs,Vol.VI., pp. 6G8, GGO.) It seems at any rate better to use the term \" Spiritism \"\u2014\ncommon to all nations except the English-American\u2014for the belief in the agency of\nspirits, leaving \" Spiritualism \" to its older meaning as the opposite of Materialism in\nphilosophy. This change has been advocated from the \" Spiritualistic \" camp ;\u2014and\nany difference of theoretic views between English and foreign believers can be much\nbetter expressed in a more direct way than by this cumbrous use of two terms, of\nwhich one is wanted for other purposes.\n2 Eor an account of some of these investigations see Proccedingt, Vol. IV.,\npp. 45-110.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 147\nbeen the case in earlier years, very few of such private circles now exist-\nwhile those that do exist seldom report their results even in the Spirit\nistic Press. And thus, since the foundation of our Society in 1882,\niittle has been added to the pre-existing body of evidence for Spiritism,\nexcept some fresh accounts of seances with paid mediums, and especially\nwith Mr. Eglinton. Mr. Eglinton's claims to the production of physical\nphenomena were discussed in our Proceedings and Journal in 1886-7,\nand he has since that date retired into private life. Some imitations of\nhis performances were given by the late Mr. Davey, an amateur conjurer,\n\"with very remarkable results. Not only were almost all the witnesses\n{who were told to form their own opinion on the matter) convinced\nthat some occult agency was at work (and the events, as they described\nthem, certainly seemed to need that hypothesis); but even after Mr.\nDavey had avowed himself a conjurer, and had explained to an expert\nin conjuring (now a member of this Committee) his modus operandi\nthroughout, many Spiritists continued to believe that \" spirits \" after\nall had aided Mr. Davey in achieving his marvels. Considering, then,\nthe evidence thus and otherwise obtained of the incapacity of ordinary\neducated persons to determine the limits of a conjurer's power, and,\non the other hand, the mass of evidence tending to show fraud on the\npart of professional mediums, it does not seem worth while, as a rule,\nto examine the testimony to physical marvels occurring in the presence\nof professional mediums.\nThe case is different with phenomena where no professional medium\nintervenes. Here, even when the marvellous phenomena are such as might\neasily have been produced by wilful deception, it' may be in the highest\ndegree improbable that they were so produced, owing to the absence of\nmotive and the probity and intelligence of the persons concerned. Self-\ndeception, no doubt, is not similarly improbable, and is a vera causa\nthat must always be carefully kept in view. But its probability varies\n\"very much according to the nature of the marvels recorded. For this\nTeason, among others, it will be well to begin by distinguishing,\nbroadly and briefly, the main kinds of phenomena alleged by Spiritists\nto occur, always confining our attention to those in which no paid\nmedium was concerned.\n1. Many of the phenomena referred to spirit agency occur along with\n\"what we already recognise as phenomena of automatism, of which auto\nmatic writing forms a leading type; and automatic are undoubtedly liable\nto be taken for Spiritistic phenomena by witnesses of perfect good faith.\nBut phenomena of this kind may in two main ways extend themselves\nbeyond the limits which any recognised human automatism can cover.\nIntellectually they may transcend those limits, if the facts conveyed in\nthe automatic messages transcend any information which the operators\ncan ever have possessed. The messages in that case will be such as\nL 2\n\f148 F. W. H. Myers.\nunconscious mental action cannot be pressed to explain. But the\nextremely interesting line of inquiry thus suggested lies outside of our\npresent purpose, and can be pursued without either accepting or\ndenying the Spiritistic hypotheses on other points. Again, pheno\nmena cognate to these automatic actions may physically transcend the\nlimits of recognised human automatism, if the movements occurring in\nconnection with them are such as unconscious muscular action cannot\nbe pressed to explain.\n2. Such motor effects as these, however, stand only at the beginning\nof the physical phenomena of Spiritism. We find testimony to the\nactual movements of objects, not in contact with any living person ;\nmovements not hallucinatory, but leaving permanent trace upon the\nponderable world. These telekinetic movements (as M. Aksakof calls\nthem) may have appeared to have no visible cause, or they may have\nseemed to be caused by quasi-human organisms or parts of organisms.\nWith these latter I shall not here deal. The most important of\nthem, putting paid seances aside, are those alleged to have occurred in\nthe presence of Mr. D. D. Home, on which Professor Barrett and I\nhave touched in the Society for Psychical Research Journal for July,\n1889.\nIn this paper, however, we must confine ourselves to the more\nordinary displacements alleged to occur without recognisable terrene\ncause. And, in fact, in our already collected testimony on other\nsubjects some evidence of this kind has been recorded which should,\nit is plain, be considered in this connection.\n3. Another large class of phenomena ascribed to spirits are plainly\nakin to certain hypnotic phenomena, and especially to so-called clair\nvoyance or lucidity ; and will be best considered in that connection.\nThus far it would seem as though each branch of the phenomena,\nmight be taken, so to say, on its merits, without our involving ourselves\nin any speculative system at all. There must, it is clear, be further\nallegations advanced before anything like a cult or a religion can be\nevolved from these premises. And these additional allegations must\nform the differentia of Spiritism. On examination they are found\nto be two, one relating to practical method, and the other to interpre\ntation.\n4. It is alleged that these phenomena are not solely sporadic and,\nspontaneous, but can be evoked in the presence of certain persons\nknown as mediums.\n5. And it is alleged that spirits of persons long dead (not necessarily\nhaunting ghosts), and perhaps also unembodied spirits of other kinds,\ncan and do communicate with men ; so that the explanation which\nthe spirits give of the phenomena of communication has an authority\nindependent of our own intelligence.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 149\nNow it will be seen at once that it is in connection with these two\nlatter allegations that the main diseases of evidence, so to say, have\narisen.- The Spiritistic method (which may quite conceivably in\nitself be sound and necessary) has encouraged the craft of impostors,\ntrading on the expectation that certain persons would be found here\nand there to possess occult powers which made their aid in such\ninquiries invaluable. And the Spiritistic theory (which may quite\nconceivably in itself be true and important) has encouraged the\ncredulity and superstition of those who should have been observers, but\nhave become devotees. It has encouraged an appeal to authority in\nthe very inception of an inquiry in which rational scepticism, calm dis\nengagement of mind, are needed in an even exceptional degree.\nIt would seem desirable, then, if it be possible, to make in some\nsense a new departure in this inquiry by investigating the phenomena\nas they stand, without taking into account the still more contentious\nmatter connected with the theories by which they are commonly bound\ntogether. Thus, in our present inquiry as to physical movements, we\ncan classify the alleged cases, as far as possible, according to the special\ngroup of otherwise attested phenomena, occurring apart from regular\nmediumship,\u2014such as automatism, telepathy, post-mortem apparitions,\n,and the like,\u2014with which each alleged case of physical movements bears\nsome apparent connection. If we do not find any trustworthy cases of\nphysical movements in any way correlated with these aforesaid groups,\nwe shall not, indeed, have disproved the physical phenomena peculiar\nto Spiritistic seances altogether ; but we shall have deprived them of\ncollateral support, and left them in an entirely isolated and anomalous\nposition. If, on the other hand, we find that evidence as to physical\nmovements is good and widely dispersed in connection with various\nother forms of psychical events, then, though we shall not have proved\nthe physical phenomena peculiar to the seance-room, we shall have\nprepared the way for their acceptance if they shall turn out to be\nindependently well-attested.\nIf there be any truth in Spiritism, it must surely be in some\nsense continuous with other truth. The evoked phenomena must be a\n,development or a systematisation of the spontaneous phenomena,\nrather than a wholly new manifestation. And we are more likely to\nunderstand the evoked phenomena, if genuine, by taking them, so to\nsay, from this evolutionary point of view, than by assuming that\n\" the Hydesville rappings \" inaugurated a new era, and that \" Modern\nSpiritualism \" has supplied already a body of revelation which we are\nbound to accept as our guide in the new inquiry.\nAnd indeed in no other investigation, (it must once more be\nrepeated), has pre-conceived theory exercised a more damaging effect\non experiment. The theory here has been attractive and interesting\n\f150 F. W. H.'Myers.\nin a unique degree ; it has imparted a strong stimulus to hope and\nemotion. On the other hand, the phenomena on which the theory-\nrested have been peculiarly hard to come at ; they have been rare,\nelusive, and enigmatic. There has consequently been a tendency to\ntake some of the phenomena for granted without further trouble, and\nto surround others with all kinds of glosses which may keep them in\nharmony with the theory whose truth is so earnestly desired. And\nsince most of the alleged phenomena are easily imitable by fraud, an\nunusual field has been offered for imposture.\nIn this Report I shall at any rate avoid that special kind of\nsuspicion which the presence of pecuniary motive for imposture inspires.\nHence I shall not be bound constantly to assume as probable fraudu\nlent intention combined with practised skill. Of course there may be\nmany motives, other than pecuniary, which may prompt to trickery.\nThere may be a morbid or malicious desire to deceive ; there may be\nabnormal states in which fraud is unconsciously practised ; or there\nmay be (especially with children) a mere wish to attract notice, or to\nbe amused, without any serious realisation of the guilt of deceit. And\nquite apart from conscious or unconscious fraud, mere inaccuracy of\nobservation and carelessness of record have often transformed very\nordinary incidents into apparent marvels. It is with full recollection\nof these various sources of error that I, nevertheless, offer the following\nnarratives as well worthy of my readers' attention. With the excep\ntion of phenomena obtained in the presence of Mr. D. D. Home (which\nin several respects form a group by themselves), our collection includes\nthe bulk of such fairly well attested cases of physical movements\noccurring not in the presence of paid mediums as we have thus far\nbeen able to discover. Moreover, it includes more than one narrative\nof poor evidential quality,, admitted with the direct object of indicating\npoints to be observed, and of leading to further experiment.\nWe will divide our cases, as already suggested, into groups corre\nsponding as far as may be with the various classes of psychical incident\nwith which we are already familiar.\nA. First I will take physical movements connected with automa\ntism ; by which I mean physical movements not definitely pointing to\nthe operation of other intelligences than those of the persons present.\nThis will be our most extensive class, as we shall include in it some\ncases where a series of phenomena, though they may claim connection\nwith some departed personality, do yet cling about or accompany some\ngiven living person, or \" medium.\" In such a case I prefer the word\n\" automatist,\"\u2014as not prejudging the question whether spirits other\nthan the medium's own are at work, but implying merely that the move\nments, &c, in some way depend on his presence, but are not consciously\ncaused by him.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 151\nB. Next will come physical movements connected with telepathy\nbetween living persons, or near the moment of death.\nC. Next will come physical movements associated with phantasms of\nthe dead,\u2014or phantasms of that obscure type with which cases of\n\" haunting \" have made us familiar.\nD. It is not, of course, possible to divide our cases with accuracy\namong these classes ; and especially there are certain cases of sporadic\nand apparently motiveless movements which, if not due to some\nordinary but overlooked cause, nevertheless afford ws no definite\nindication of the nature of their supernormal source. Some of these\nit may be well to cite at the end of our list.\nA. Let us begin with the simplest of all cases. Two persons place\ntheir hands on a table, and it moves rapidly and fitfully about. They\nfeel convinced that they are not pushing it. Are we to account this as\na \" physical phenomenon,\" a movement unexplained by ordinary laws 1\nThe answer is, No ; for evidential purposes we must not so reckon\nit. We need not, indeed, assert that, could Faraday's test be applied\n(which it cannot be, save in the very simplest cases), we should neces\nsarily find that the force at work all came through the sitters' muscles\nin the ordinary way. If tables ever move loithout contact, then the\nforce, whatever it may be, which makes them so move is probably\noperative also in some cases where contact exists. Just similarly, if\nthought-transference exists, thought-transference is probably operative\nin certain cases of the \" willing game,\" where there is contact between\nthe operator and the person willed. But, nevertheless, when engaged\nin proving the reality of thought-transference, we have felt it\nnecessary to exclude from our evidence any case where contact could\nhave afforded opportunity for some slight push, even were it uncon\nsciously given and unconsciously received. Muscle-reading\u2014and for\nsimilar reasons all kinds of gesture-reading\u2014had to be definitely set\naside before thought-reading had any chance of rigorous demonstration.\nAnd so with the case of these table-movements. Unless in cases of well-\nobserved elevation of a heavy body in air, when touched only from\nabove, it is not safe to cite instances where there is any contact as\nproving any force beyond the force which is operative when some con\ntact is known to exist. When tables move rapidly, it is difficult to\nknow exactly where the hands touching them are, or how hard they are\npushing. Undoubted good faith in the operators is not enough to\nreassure us ; for we by no means know the limits of unconscious\nmuscular action.\nAnd now another difficulty meets us. Among the phenomena most\nfrequently alleged, raps hold a prominent place. These percussive\nnoises, occurring sometimes apparently in the woodwork of the table,\nsometimes in other parts of the room, can rarely be explained by\n\f152 F. W. H. Myers.\nany unconscious movements of the persons present. They may, of\ncourse, be due to fraud, and they may sometimes be produced by\nunconscious movements of the throat or of some joint or tendon.\nBut assuming for argument's sake that the raps are genuine\n\" psychical phenomena \" of some kind\u2014and for this there is a great\ndeal of evidence\u2014we find the problem of their true nature by no means\nan easy one. Are we to suppose that actual sound-waves are produced\nin the air 1 If so, of course the smallest \" rap '' is an interference with\nthe ponderable world every whit as definite as the \"levitation\" of a\nmedium on to the table. Or are they mere hallucinations\u2014with\nsome origin, perhaps, outside the minds of the sitters, but operating\nupon these minds in some direct fashion, and not upon the air of\nthe room 1\nThis problem is not altogether new. In Phantasms of the Living\nwe had to consider many cases where noises were heard by several\npersons at once. And in some of these cases\u2014and in others since\ncommunicated,\u2014we have found that the sound remained unheard\nby some person who must have heard it, had it been propagated by\nvibrations of the air in the normal way. Hallucinatory sounds seem to\nrun parallel in this respect to hallucinatory sights. They may be\nperceived by one out of many persons present, or by some, or by all.1\nNor need this irregularity seem more surprising in the case of sounds\nthan in the case of sights. In either case it is inexplicable by\nordinary laws ; in either case the mode of genesis of the supernormal\nimpression is unknown. (See Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II.,\np. 105, note.)\nBut if sounds so loud and marked as were some of those in the cases\nabove alluded to in Phantasms of the Living must be treated as in\nsome sense hallucinatory, and not as real physical movements of the air,\nthen we are bound to extend the same caution to our accounts of ra]>s.\nIn some respects, it is true, raps, if genuine at all, have a higher\nclaim to be considered as physical movements than some other phantas\nmal sounds possess.\nThus (1) they are often more continuous and capable of being more\nsteadily observed ; (2) they are often more definite in quality, corre\nsponding to the resonance of various objects in or upon which they seem\nto occur ; (3) they sometimes occur (as alleged) in connection with\nunmistakable physical movements,\u2014either vibrations accompanying\nthe sounds, or other movements intercurrent with or announced by the\nsounds ; (4) and, finally, I do not know of a recorded instance where\nraps were heard, so to say, electively,\u2014that is, by some persons only out\nof those who were physically in a position to hear them.\n1 See Society for Psychical Research Journal for April, 1890.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 153\nWe must bear these points in mind ; but nevertheless we seem\nbound in no case to treat mere sounds of any kind, any more than\nmere sights, as proofs of physical movement. Rigorously speaking, we\nhave no proof of physical movement, unless there is some displacement\nor modification of the material world which is capable of registration\nby automatic agency\u2014as by the phonograph or the sensitised photo\ngraphic plate. The phonograph, as now improved, might successfully\nbe applied to the registration of raps ; and the experiment is one that\nwe hope will eventually be made. Somewhat similarly, it is to the\nsensitised plate that an appeal as to the true nature of apparitions\nought to lie. But waiving what lies at present beyond our reach, we\nshall of course consider that a physical movement has taken place if\nthe position of objects in the room, as discerned by our ordinary senses,\nremains permanently changed after the movement. And there may,\nmoreover, be cases where the movement is so distinct, so persistent, and\nwitnessed similarly by so many persons, that the evidence for its\nreality is not seriously impaired by the ultimate reversion of the object\nto its former place. Thus, the repeated rising and falling of a heavy\ntable, and its repeated movements over the floor from side to side, as\ndescribed in the Dialectical Society's Report, pp. 10, 11, 15, will\nhardly be ascribed to collective hallucination. The movement probably\ndid occur, and if it was not genuinely supernormal, we must, it would\nseem, ascribe it to conscious or unconscious fraud.\nGroup A. Case I.\nDialectical Society's Report on Spiritualism (London : Burns, 1873),\npp. 10, 11, 15, 373-391. This may serve as the first case of my first\ngroup,\u2014the group which by some stretching of terms we have described\nas connected with automatism. The details just given will somewhat\nexplain this classification. Had the table merely moved while the\nhands of the persons present were touching it, we should undoubtedly\nhave ascribed such movement to their unconscious muscular action,\neven though the movements were so considerable that this explanation\nwas somewhat strained. And in these cases, in fact, the table began by\nmoving with hands in contact with it, and only gradually gained the\npower of moving untouched by anyone. The simplest supposition,\ntherefore, seems to be that if some force unconsciously exercised by the\nsitters caused the earlier movements in the series, some force uncon\nsciously exercised by the sitters caused the later movements also. This\nis at any rate simpler than to assume that there was any direct force\nexercised by invisible beings, independently of the sitters. Ignorant as\nwe are, however, of the nature of any such supposed force, we cannot\nat present assume to classify the cases of its display in more than a\nsuperficial manner.\n\f154 F. W. H. Myers.\nGroup A. Case II.\nAnother case already printed is that of \" M.A. (Oxon.).\" The\nphenomena obtained by this gentleman are described in a very scat\ntered way in various publications of which several are out of print.\n(Human Nature, March to August, 1874; and Spirit Identity.) It\nis greatly to be wished that the records of this remarkable case should\nbe gathered together and placed before the world in an authentic and\nconnected form. The phenomena described included raps, music, lights,\nscents, movements of objects without contact, &c. The good faith of\nthe writer (a clergyman well known to me for seventeen years) has, so\nfar as I know, never been impugned, and I consider it as quite beyond\nquestion.\nGroup A.

But for the present I pass on to some unpublished\nnarratives. I begin with an isolated movement, occurring under\ncircumstances which seem to give it a kind of coincidental or purposive\ncharacter.\nGroup A. Case V. (S. 338.)\nFrom the Rev. Edward T. Vaughan, Langleybury Vicarage, King's Langley.\nAugust 25th, 1884.\nSome three or four years back, I had occasion to visit a parishioner who\nwas seriously ill, one afternoon in the winter time as it was growing dark. I\nhad seen him several times before since his illness commenced, and had\nalways found him in the same bedroom. On this occasion I had been praying\nwith him, and his wife was kneeling at the opposite side of the bed to myself.\nAs I was saying the last words of the prayer, we (the woman and myself)\ndistinctly saw a small table, which stood about a yard from the foot of the\nbed, rise two or three inches from the ground and come down with a violent\nthump upon the floor, so loudly that the man, who was lying with his eyes\nclosed, started up and asked, with some terror, what had occasioned it. On\nexamining the table, I found that a glass with medicine in it, which stood\nupon the table with several other articles, had been so shaken that some of\nthe contents were spilt. My first idea was that something had been thrown\ndown in the room below, where my wife, a sister of the woman's, and an\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 155\naged uncle were sitting. On going downstairs and inquiring, I found that\nthis was not so ; that they had been all sitting perfectly quiet in the room,\nand thought we had thrown down something in the bedroom. There was no\none else in the house. The man died about a week after this took place.\nI add my name as you wish to show this to others.\nE. T. Vaughan,\nVicar of Langleybury.\nTo this case the following letters belong :\u2014\nLangleybury Vicarage, King's Langley.\nJune 27th, 1888.\nI enclose according to your wish a statement from Mrs. Vaughan of what\nshe remembers of the curious incident. I am sorry to say the widow, though\nshe still lives in this village, is not capable of writing down a statement of\nwhat she saw and heard that evening, though she can give a very clear\naccount of the circumstances to anyone who examines her orally. The man's\nname was John Wilson, a bricklayer in the employ of the Earl of Clarendon.\nHe died on December 7th, 1881, about a week after the strange occurrence.\nI have never since experienced any similar phenomenon.\nEdward T. Vaughan.\nMrs. Vaughan writes under the same date as follows :\u2014\nIn confirmation of the story of Wilson's deathbed, I can say I was sitting\nin the room below the sick man's with two other people (his sister-in-law and\nuncle), in perfect silence, as every word read in the room above could be\ndistinctly heard by us. Just as the last words of the prayer were being said,\nwe were startled by a loud and sudden noise, as if some heavy piece of furni\nture had fallen in the room above. My first impression was that the man\nwas taken worse, and that his wife, moving hastily to him, had knocked over\na table. None of us spoke, though we started and looked at each other, and\nexpected to hear some one called ; but almost the next minute I heard Mr.\nVaughan address the man on leaving, and come downstairs with the wife. I\nwent to meet them with her sister, and though nothing more was said by any\nof us than \"good-bye,\" I saw by all the faces that something unusual had\nhappened. As soon as we were out of the house I said to Mr. Vaughan,\n\"What was that noise just as you were reading the prayers ? \" and he told me\nthe story you have heard, and it formed the principal topic of our long walk\nhome, wondering what it was, and trying to explain it, without in the least\ncoming to any conclusion but greater wonder.\nE. L. Vaughan.\nThis is a brief and simple incident ; but it is particularly hard to\nexplain by ordinary causes\u2014such as an earthquake or a mistaken\nmemory.\nGroup A. Case VI. (S. 4.)\nA somewhat similar case was sent to Mr. Gurney by Miss H.\nPower, of 19, Spring-street, Paddington, in May, 1887. Mr. Gurney had\nan interview with Miss Power, and considered her a good witness.\n\f156 F. W. H. Myers.\nUnder date May 6th, 1887, Miss Power writes as follows :\u2014,\nIn 1883 I occupied part of a house, 43, Fitzroy-street, W. I had been\n.given abook written by \" M.A. (Oxon.)\" [which greatly jarred on the religious\nfaith of the reader]. At the moment when I felt most angry, an ordinary ladies'\nhandbag, containing sundry articles, which I had laid down in the centre of\na, large armchair, was flung with great force under the table, making a\nconsiderable noise as it fell. I was lying on the sofa at some distance. At\nthe same time loud raps came in different places on the wall. An old man\nto whom I had given the use of the kitchen, and who used to attend on me,\ncame up to the first floor, saying I had been knocking on the floor as if for\nhelp. I felt annoyed at the disturbance, but did not say anything to the old\nman or his wife, as they were Irish, and would very likely have been alarmed.\nShortly after, a drawing-board which stood in an empty space between two\nsides of a writing-table, slid out on its thin edge into the room and then fell\nover, about a yard from the writing-table.\nMiss Power mentions some other small incidents which might possibly\nhave been due to a servant ; but she had no further annoyance. She\ndisliked the manifestations, and would exert her will to prevent their\nrecurrence. She has had no hallucinations of sight or hearing, but\nshe has on two occasions been conscious of contact with apparently\nsolid bodies, when awrare that none such were near. She writes easily\nwith planchette, and has a tendency to the cognate form of automatism,\nwhich consists in hearing certain thoughts formulated as \" internal\nvoices.\" Miss Power referred to two clergymen to whom she had\nmentioned the matter in 1883 ; but the Rev. J. J. Coxhead, St. John's\nVicarage, Fitzroy-square, has oidy \" some hazy remembrance of her\nmentioning something of the kind.\"\nThe case, therefore, rests practically on one person's memory. It is\ngiven here on account of the interest of the fact that the movement of\nan untouched object occurred, in one instance at least, at a moment of\nstrong excitement on the part of the witness. In the next case to be\ncited, which is evidentially much stronger, there seems to have been\nabsolutely no emotion of any kind involved. The movement was isolated\nand meaningless, and has not been repeated.\nGroup A. Case VII. Graham Case. (S. 5.)\nColonel Taylor writes as follows :\u2014\nR. M. College, Farnboro'.\nJuly lWi, 1886.\nI send you with this an account of table movements which I suppose will\nbe of use. The young man who relates the story was about 18 years old\nwhen the things he speaks of took place about two or three years ago ; he is\nnow in a W. I. regiment.\nDuring the time that he was here as a cadet, he told me the story, which\nhe related quite in the same way as he has now done on paper.\n'' The following is a description of how, on two occasions, a table was\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 157\nseen to move without any visible agency and which was ascribed to some\ncurious power called into existence by the well-known amusement of ' table-\nturning. '\n'' At the time, my mother, sister, and younger brother were living in an\nold-fashioned house in a country village, and we occasionally passed the\ndusk of the winter afternoons in what we termed ' turning the table.'\n\" We tried it as a matter of curiosity and amusement at first, but after\nwards, when we became almost uniformly successful, as something to be\ninvestigated as far as possible.\n\"The table in question was a round spider-legged ladies' work-table,\ncovered with red cloth, and about two feet in diameter. We sat round it\nwith our fingers touching and resting lightly on the top and edge of the table.\nSometimes there were three, sometimes four, and afterwards now and then\nonly two. Our custom was to ask the table to speak to us. This it did by\nmomentarily raising one leg of its three off the floor half an inch or so, twice\nfor yes and once for no. It would spell words and sentences to us by raising\nthe leg a certain number of times consecutively, corresponding to the number\nof the required letter in the alphabet, once for a\u2014twice for b\u2014three times\nfor c\u2014and so on, a short pause intervening between each letter.\n\"Sometimes it would stubbornly refuse to move, and on these occasions no\namount of patience could prevail upon it to talk with us. At other times it\nwould be outrageous in its behaviour\u2014walking round the room, and hop\nping on one leg, getting on chairs and performing many other curious evolu\ntions. We all considered these vagaries of the table very extraordinary, but\nfirmly believed in the good faith of each other and the table, and agreed to\nconsider the table possessed on these talkatively and athletically inclined\noccasions with a certain spirit. We often talked over these movements of\nour table and expressed a belief that it might move without any contact with\nour joined hands if we could only obtain sufficient influence over it. Accord\ningly we tried sitting round the table without joining hands or placing them\nat all in contact with it, and simply wishing earnestly for it to move\u2014but it\nnever did so on these occasions.\n\"At last one evening after we had concluded a talk with our spirit, lights\nwere brought and we sat down to read. There were three of us only in the\nroom, my mother, young brother, and myself. Our relative positions were\nas shown below :\u2014\n1. Our small table.\n2. My brother.\n3. My mother.\n4. Myself.\n5. Larger table.\nMy brother was sitting near the fire with his eyes closed. My mother and\nmyself were reading at the large table. All at once I heard a scraping sound\nupon the carpet as if something was being dragged over it. My mother and I\nlooked up and we immediately asked each other if it could possibly be our\ntable moving of its own accord. We both then recommenced reading.\nPresently the sound was heard again. I looked quickly at the small table, and\n'O -> 2\nO\n5\n\f158 F. W. H. Myers.\nsaw it distinctly move for about six inches in the direction shown by the\narrow. My brother also looked up and started from his chair somewhat\nalarmed. My mother also saw it, and I must confess we all felt to a certain\ndegree startled by what we had seen, and not wishing to see any more just\nthen, we removed it from the room.\n. \"The next occasion on which it moved of its own accord was a week or so,\nI believe, after, when I was the only witness. I was left alone in the room,\nthe others had just left, and were only a few yards or so from the door. We\nhad been amusing ourselves by making the table walk round the room, but it\nhad become so violent that we gave it up, and it was left standing a few\nfeet from the fire, which was brightly burning, and the only light in the\nroom.\n\"It occurred to me to try if I could make the table move by subjecting it\nto a certain amount of indignity, as it had always proved particularly violent\nwhen treated in any way unceremoniously.\n\"I then picked up a small terrier which was lying on the rug and held it\ntowards the table as if to place the animal on the top. To my intense astonish\nment the table jumped towards me, rising off the ground, and so alarmed the\ndog that he squeaked and ran away. The table moved laterally quite six\ninches and rose in the air about the same distance. I left it lying on the\nfloor and went to tell the others. Soon after this I left home for school and\nI don't think anything further of the kind described took place.\n\" H. W. Gore Graham.\n\"Mary E.

(S. 6.)\nTo avoid prolixity, I shall classify the \"higher grade\" manifestations\nunder their several heads as observed by me, and describe them as they\noccurred.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 159\n(a) Knocks on the table.\nPreceded by an uneasy motion in the table, which moved and swayed\nrapidly from side to side; on my expressing a wish for \"knocks\" oh it,\nthose motions would suddenly cease, and in the space of one minute or so, and\nsometimes at once, a faint knock would be heard in the woodwork of the\ntop, the knocks gradually increasing in number, rapidity, and force, till they\nresembled the driving in of small tacks on every portion of its surface. All\nthis time our finger-tips alone rested on the table\u2014neither feet nor dress in\ncontact. I could at will cause these sounds to cease or reappear, one, two,\nthree, or any number I demanded, and stranger still, I could induce a\nsuccession of knocks of various degrees of intensity and so delivered as to\n\"knock out\" with wonderful accuracy any tune I asked for. I can now\nrecall amongst many such the airs of \"Not for Joe,\" and \" The Blue-bells\nof Scotland,\" as especially well marked.1\n(6) Rising or Levitation.\nThis manifestation is, perhaps, the most unaccountable of any which I have\nmet with in my experience. Its production required a great amount of\nconcentrated will power,and when successful the results were startling, and the\napparent physical force developed really wonderful. The \"rising\" was\ngenerally preceded by a continuous fusillade of \"knocks\" in the substance\nof the table, till finally they resembled the sound of the sparks given off by\nthe prime conductor of a large Holtz electrical machine when charging a\nbattery of Leyden jars ; when the knocks had, as it were, reached a climax,\nthe table slowly swayed from side to side like a pendulum, stopped com\npletely, and then, as if imbued with life, and quite suddenly, rose completely\noff the floor to a height of a foot or 14 inches at least, and nearly always came\ndown with immense force, which would have proved uncomfortable for any\nhuman foot which might happen to have been in its vicinity, and on several\noccasions proved destructive to itself, as the broken limbs of the table we\nused at Kinsale could testify. This table, I may add, was a round, rather\nheavy, walnut one, with a central column, standing on three claw legs, and\nit would have been impossible for us unaided to have developed the force (by\nmuscular energy) required to produce this manifestation. In this instance\nthe law of gravitation was quite overcome, the table being repelled from\nthe floor in opposition to its power, and afterwards attracted by the com\nbined force of gravity and the unknown force developed. On several\noccasions I have succeeded in raising the table without contact, the latter\nrising to our fingers held over it at a height of several inches, like the keeper\nto a strong electro-magnet ; in these instances the table swayed slowly\nin mid-air for many seconds before coming down with a crash. The\nproduction of this mysterious manifestation appeared to require a great\nexpenditure of the latent energy which produced the phenomenon, and the\ntable- always seemed supercharged with the \"force-producing fluid,\" if I\nmay be permitted to use the term ; knocks were heard on every portion of\nthe table's surface, the chairs we sat on, and even on various articles of\nfurniture at a considerable distance from us.

An\nexpressed wish of mine to that effect immediately released it and forced it to\nreturn to its tilted position, when this extraordinary resisting power was\nagain fully developed. I will just here remark that I have on several\noccasions, in Dublin, induced a table to \"levitate,\" though previously\nheavily loaded with large books ; the positive danger and injury resulting\nfrom its subsequent \"attraction\" prevented my attempting it oftener.\n(c) Scratching* awl muffled sounds.\nThese are varieties of the knocking phenomena and resembled the sounds\nproduced by drawing a finger nail slowly across the under surface of the\ntable, and again resembling that of a duster being hastily \"brushed over\"\nthe same place. These curious phenomena I have frequently induced, and\nchanged same to knocks and Dice versa at will. Miss McDaniel has also been\nmost successful in producing the same.\nAll the manifestations, excepting that referred to as having been witnessed\nin Dublin, have been the result of our investigations in Kinsale.\nGeo.

(S. 7.)\nNovember 1st, 1887.\nDear Sir,\u2014Some occurrences that have taken place in this house\nlately will, I think, be of interest to the Psychical Society ; I will give a some\nwhat detailed account of them, and shall of course be very glad to give you\nany information you wish in case you find it of sufficient interest to pursue\nfurther.\nPerhaps I had better state briefly what occurred, first of all. (I should\nsay that I am writing in the main from notes taken on the days in question,\nnot simply from memory.)\nOn Friday, September 23rd, I took my four pupils to a circus, my\nlady housekeeper going too, leaving my two servants at home. We left\nat about 2 p.m., or earlier. All but myself returned at about 5.30, and\nfound the two servants on the door-step, telling the boys not to go in by the\narea door (the kitchens being below ground), and explaining that all the\nbells were ringing violently, no one touching them, and they had been\ndoing so almost ever since we left, from about half-past two. When I\ncame back I found the same state of things ; the servants almost in hysterics,\nand the bells ringing. The bells hang all in one row just inside the area\ndoor and opposite the kitchen door,\u2014nine of them. There is one bell at the\ntop of the house on the landing,\u2014a call bell. Of the nine bells below, eight\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 161\nof them rang that evening ; the ninth (the end bell ringing from the back of\nthe house) I did not see ring at all, but the cook said it did ring several\ntimes ; I cannot, however, vouch for that. The others all rang at different\ntimes, several together ; my impression is that I saw and heard at least four\ntogether ; I certainly several times saw three, and from what the servants\ntold me and my housekeeper they sometimes almost all rang at once. The\nringing was sudden and very violent, louder than we ever rang a bell in the\nordinary way ; indeed we could not, I believe (though we can ring them\nlouder), ring them with such a sudden and violent ring by pulling the handles.\nI thought the probability was that a cat had got somewhere where all the\nwires were together, had got entangled, and was trying to get out, and so\npulled the bells. I went in the roof and found only two wires, one that of the\nend bell, which rang very little if at all that evening (as I have mentioned\nbefore); the other the call bell at the top of the house, which, I believe, did\nnot ring at all that day. However, as I supposed the wires might run\ntogether elsewhere, I put it down to some such cause, and so felt no trouble\nin leaving the house, as I had an evening engagement, my housekeeper and\nI both going out to supper. I left first, and when she came to the friend's\nhouse she said the last thing she had heard was all the bells pealing together.\n(I imagine she did not literally mean she was certain that all the nine rang,\nbut that was the impression it gave her.) I left home, I think, at about\nseven o'clock. At about 9.30, when we were at supper, the cook came over\n(it was about three-quarters of a mile from home) to say we must come back\nas there were such dreadful knockings going on in the house. We went off\nat once of course, our friends returning with us, being much interested.\nWhat had occurred in the meantime was this : soon after my housekeeper\nleft, viz., at about 7.30, the knocking or hammering began. It sounded like\na mallet on a wooden floor, speaking loosely. The laundryman came in\nsoon after it began, and was, I believe, quite scared ; he offered to stay in\nthe house while the cook went for her brother, who lives near ; and she\nfetched him. The baker's man also came, and was convinced that there was\na man in the house hammering, and after searching the house and finding\nnothing he went straight to the police-station and told them to send up. As.\nsoon as she had fetched her brother the cook went off for us, and her brother,\nwho is a middle-aged, respectable, and I should say intelligent man, a teacher\nin the Board school, was so scared by the knocking that he would not stay in\nthe house, but went on the door-step with the housemaid and stood there\ntill the policemen came, the noise going on all the time. (I believe the bell-\nringing was not so frequent while the knocking went on, but cannot say for\ncertain.)\nWhen I came back I had the felicity of finding three policemen in the\nhouse, and the noise had ceased. I believe they had heard and seen nothing,\nexcept seeing all the \"indicators\" of the bells wagging merrily. So they soon\ncleared out. They offered to search the house if I liked, but I was so per\nfectly acquainted with it that I was certain no one could be in hiding, i.e.,\nin any place where he could produce all the sounds, not to mention the\nunlikelihood of anyone's wishing to do so if he were in hiding. Nothing\noccurred till my friends also left, and then at about 10 p.m. one of the bells\nrang slightly, when no one pulled it. I then went upstairs to the top of the.\n\f162 F. W. H. Myers.\nhouse, and when up there the servants and my housekeeper heard the noise\nonce, very loudly, as it evidently frightened the latter, who had not heard it\nbefore. I did not hear anything in particular, but that was simply because\njust at the time it occurred I was talking and shutting the door (I need not\nsay that the shutting the door had nothing to do with it), and the noise close\nby doubtless rendered the other less noticeable. However, I went down\nstairs and was just going from the hall down the stairs into the kitchen (the\ntwo servants and the housekeeper standing all together in the hall), when I\nheard it. Perhaps I can best convey the impression it gave to me by saying\nthat having been somewhat sceptical before and thinking it had been\nexaggerated, &c, as soon as I had heard it that once I had not the slightest\nquestion as to whether it were imaginary, or a cat, or any noise outside or\nconnected with the bell-wires, &c. ; it was simply as clear and loud a noise\nas if someone had hammered three times in succession quickly on the boards\nof one of the rooms, with a mallet, just about as hard as possible. It is of\ncourse difficult to convey an idea of a sound like that, but as near as I can\njudge a (perhaps slightly muffled) mallet hammered on a floor gives the best\nimpression, I told my servant to rap the floor to-night with the knob of a\nheavy stick as hard as she could, while I was downstairs ; the sound was\ndistinctly sharper and so far clearer than the original sound, but I may s;iy\nliterally bore no comparison to it in point of intensity ; roughly speaking, it\nwas not much more than half as loud ; while two friends that were with me\nto-night confessed that that noise would be sufficiently startling if heard\nsuddenly.\nI heard it again a few minutes later, this time twice repeated in succes\nsion, quickly. It gave me the impression of being in the dining-room floor,\nbut it is difficult to locate a sound like that ; I am not inclined, therefore, to\npay much attention to what other people said as to that point, but the\nservants, &c. , said it seemed to be in different parts of the house, and\ncertainly could not agree as to any one definite part.\nPerhaps what I wrote down at the time in regard to my servant (which\nwas written simply from the point of view of whether she was producing it\nmischievously, and not from the wish to give an idea of how loud it was) will\nconvey a better impression of it ; I wrote down that my conviction was that\nflhe could not haw made such a noise with a hammer even if she tried.\nI have perhaps been rather unnecessarily particular in regard to this,\nbecause I wish to show that while it naturally occurs to anyone, as indeed it\ndid to me, that I should need to hear it several times before I was sure that\nit was not an ordinary \"house noise,\" or connected with the bell-wires, or the\nsupposed cat, &c, as a matter of fact as soon as I heard it once I said to\nmyself, \"That is enough, I don't need to hear it again to know quite well\nenough what it is.\" I could well understand that the cook's brother preferred\nthe outside of the house when alone with the housemaid.\nNothing more occurred that night ; we went to bed at about 12, and in the\nmorning I got up at 7.15 approximately, and the servants then mustered\n,sufficient courage to go downstairs. I should say they had not been down five\nminutes before the bells began ringing. By the way, I should have said that\nthe evening before, with the aid of the policemen, we took down the board over\nthe bells, and could see all the wires -and how they ran. In the morning I\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 163\nexamined them still more carefully, with the result that I felt certain (atnd\nI may as well state here that I was perfectly correct, as the bell-hanger after\nwards proved) that the wires separated directly they left the bells and ran\neach to its own particular part of the house, and thus entirely knocked on the\nhead the cat or rat theory ; since there was no point anywhere where more\nthan three wires ran at all near one another after leaving the bells, where\nthey were in full view. It would, I suppose, if there were no other reason to\npreclude the idea, have taken at the very least four separate animals ringing\nin concert.\nThe end bell and the call bell upstairs rang merrily that morning, and\nall the others as well, at times. I suppose they rang at intervals of two,\nthree, or five minutes, not often longer than that without one or more ring\ning. They rang for about two hours and then subsided.\nIn the afternoon they rang again at 3.15 (when I was alone in the house\nwith the two servants), and rang for a quarter of an hour, stopping just\nabout when our friends who had come the night before called ; and we had\nno more that day.\nThe next day, Sunday, I woke at 6.45, heard the servants go down at\nabout 7.30, and just afterwards the front door bell rang, when there was\ncertainly no one there. Nothing more occurred that day, or indeed has\noccurred since, except on one Saturday (October 8th), the front door bell rang\nin just the same way when they came down, and there was certainly no one\nthere. The possibility of a runaway ring is entirely out of the question, as I\nwill try to show in describing the house.\nThat was the last we heard or experienced.\nIt is of course impossible in writing an account like this to state all the\ntheories that occur to one's mind, and my reason for rejecting the ordinary\nexplanations'; I may say that I believe I am as capable as the average of\npeople of investigating the matter, and I was extremely careful to satisfy\nmyself of the tenability or otherwise of the hypotheses that naturally occurred\nto me, and while of course it is not worth while to go into all these, I am\nready to give my reasons for rejecting or otherwise\u2014or confessing that I had\nnot thought of\u2014any hypothesis that may be stated.\nI may as well, however, without waiting to be asked, go into some points\nwhich to my mind effectually dispose of certain of the primafacie theories.\nIn the first place, as to the possibility of cats or rats doing it ; this is a\nnew house ; it was finished about a year last May, I came into it in July,\nhaving had it papered, &c. We have never seen or heard the slightest trace\nof a rat, nor have we ever to our knowledge had a strange cat in ; nor indeed\ncould one, as far as I know, get into the floor anywhere. I could give other\narguments if needful, but I think the way the wires run makes it entirely\nunnecessary. The bath-room bell, for instance, which rang more perhaps\nthan any, is on the same wall as its bell-pull, which is on the first floor (i.e.,\ntwo floors above the bell). The wire enters a tube in full view close by the\nbell, goes right up in the tube to close to the handle ; the tube is visible to\nwithin perhaps eight inches of the handle ; so that the wire is completely\nisolated from all the other wires from the time it enters the tube close by the\nbells. Then, as I have said, the other wires diverge from close by the bells,\nin full view, and go straight to their own handles ; not all going into the roof\nm 2\n\f164 F. W. H. Myers.\nas is so often the case. The bell-hanger entirely agreed with me that it\nwould be an impossibility for any animal or even animals to ring them all as\nthey were rung.\nNext as to the question of trickery. Apart from the knowledge I have of\nmy pupils, &c, which would convince me that they had nothing to do with\nit, the greater part of all the phenomena occurred when my housekeeper and\npupils were away, and very much of it when only the two servants were in\nthe house ; so that clearly no one of us was the guilty party ; and the cook\nwas out for some time while it went on, so that the housemaid was the only\none left in the house all the time. As she had only been in the house a week\nor two of course I suspected her ; but I can say positively that as far as one\ncan trust the evidence of one's senses she was without doubt entirely free\nfrom any complicity in it. For instance, I stood in the passage in front of\nthe nine bells watching them ring, with both the servants close by ; I had\nthem in the hall, thedining-room, and other placeswhile the bells were ringing ;\nand once in particular I watched the housemaid on her knees in the middle\nof the \" wash-house \" at the back of the house, scrubbing the tiles, while the\nfront door, area door, and bath-room bells were pealing violently. I could\ngive other reasons for feeling certain of her innocence, and, as I have said, no\none else was in the house all the time it went on. Apart from this (and from\nthe evidently painful way in which they were both affected, which in itself to\nanyone who saw them would be sufficient to exculpate them, though of course\nnot carrying much weight when coming from second-hand), it would, I think,\nbe almost a mechanical impossibility for any, even the most ingenious\nmechanic to contrive an arrangement for ringing the bells as they were rung.\nThere was, as a matter of fact, nothing done to the bells themselves or the wires\nnear them, as I was able to demonstrate perfectly easily by examining them,\nand any apparatus for connecting the wires farther up would be, I think, next\ndoor to an impossibility. Four of the bedroom bells have no bell-pull,\nnothing but about an inch or so of wire projecting at the cornice, from the\nceiling. One of these goes simply up in the wall, crosses the roof, and goes\ndown some two feet to the call-bell, which I saw ringing merrily on the\nSaturday morning.\nHowever, I cannot describe all the apparatus here, only I might say that\nthe bell-hanger, plumber, and architect are all clear that it would prac\ntically be an impossibility for anyone to arrange such an apparatus as would\nbe necessary to ring the bells so, even if they had no need to conceal it. The\nsame reasoning applies even more forcibly to the supposition of anyone doing\nit outside the house. The house stands apart from any other, the nearest is\nperhaps 50 yards or so and empty ; between the two and all around are plots\nof building land growing vegetables, &c. By standing at the front door one\ncan see up and down the road for perhaps 300 yards each way, and it is out\nof the question that anyone could be doing anything near the house without\nbeing seen. A wall runs from the main road flush with the house on each side,\nand perhaps 40 yards back, so that the outside of the house is quite open, and\nthere is no chance of anyone playing a trick. Of course, besides having this\nknowledge I kept a good look-out while it was light ; especially on the Satur\nday morning, when, e.g., I stood on the door-step, whence I could command\nthe two outer doors, while both of them and one indoor bell were ringing.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 165\nI asked the bell-hanger, &c, whether the \" settling down \" of the house\noould be the cause, as I know such occurrences have been brought about by\nthis ; but besides a priori reasons which he gave why the house should not\nsettle down, he said he was certain even had it done so it could not have\ncaused such ringing. Moreover, as a matter of fact, the house shows not the\nleast sign of settling down in any way.\nI ought to say that the wires of the bells distinctly pulled\u2014it was\nnot only the bells or clappers moving ; indeed, in one or two cases they could\nbe heard grating under the floor. The bell-handles were not moved.\nOne bell (I think only one) was more than once \"pulled over,\" so that it\ndid not return to its normal position ; that I cannot do by pulling the handle,\nso it gives some idea of the sharpness of the pull.\nI have had a friend here lately, the science-master at the Grammar\nSchool, and a thoroughly scientific man, and he says he is sure that the\nringing could not be the results of any magnetic influence. There was\nnothing remarkable about the state of the weather, temperature, &c.\nAs to the knocking the following may give some idea as to the \"reality\"\nof it ; two of my deaf pupils felt it when upstairs going to bed or already in\nbed. One of them, whose attention I often cannot get by stamping as hard as\nI can on the floor, felt it directly, ami going to the door hammered it with his\nfist and asked if a man was downstairs doing so. The other one sat up in\nbed directly I went up and asked what the knocking was. So that they not\nonly felt it, but sufficiently for it to create a considerable impression on\nthem, and without having been told of the knocking from any other quarter.\nThe latter can hear loud sounds, and so I cannot say for certain whether he\nfelt or heard it ; the other must have felt it, as he is quite deaf. Of the\nother two one is too young to question at all satisfactorily on the point, the\nother was unwell and asleep all the time (of the knocking).\nBesides all the household I may as well say who else saw and heard the\noccurrences ; the grocer, and one or two men working in the gardens near\nthe house heard the bell-ringing ; the baker, the laundry-man, and the cook's\nbrother, who are all entirely independent witnesses, heard the knocking, and\nthey were all considerably affected by it.\nThat the wires were not connected is shown, I think, by the fact that\nwhen we rang one bell in the ordinary way it did not cause any others to\nring ; nor have we ever had any trouble with them in any way.\nI think perhaps there is no reason to add anything to this ; but I shall be\nmost happy if you should wish for any further explanations, or to have more\nevidence on any point, to furnish you with any information I have, or what\nis perhaps more to the point, to say if I have not the information. I may\nsay that I have had no theory proposed which is to my mind at all consistent\nwith the facts ; and friends are quite untiring in propounding new theories !\nWhile extremely interested in the work of the Psychical Society, I can\nfeel sure of not being at all biassed by any predilections towards explaining\nthings by means of \" Psychic \" forces, to the prejudice of any more simple\nexplanation.\nI am not aware whether any of the Reports deal with similar occurrences ;\nif there should be one I should be glad to have it. I have only occasionally\nseen odd numbers.\n\f166 F. W. H. Myers.\nIf you should wiah, as of course you have a perfect right, to have any\ntestimony to my reliableness as a witness, or capability of weighing, &c,\nscientific evidence, I have no doubt I could satisfy you.\nNovember 11th, 1887.\nDear Sir,\u2014I bog to acknowledge receipt of letter, and am glad to find\nthat my communication is of interest. I shall be pleased to give any facility\nfor investigation that I am able.\nI had not expected to be able to give any further news, as at the time I\nwrote everything had been quiet for some time. I have, however, further\noccurrences to report which, to my mind, are especially interesting, as con\nfirming, as well as surpassing, the nature of the previous phenomena. Un\nfortunately I was away at the time ; however, it is in my opinion extremely\nprobable that my absence directly contributed to what took place, as I will\nshow later on, and therefore I ought not to complain.\nI went out last Saturday morning, November 5th, leaving the household\nconstituted as I have mentioned in my former notes ; my lady-housekeeper,\ntwo servants, and four deaf pupils. I was away for the Sunday, and on the\nMonday morning I had a letter from my housekeeper, Mrs. K., tell\ning me of what was going on. I returned home as soon as possible, but\neverything had ceased then and nothing more has happened.\nI have, therefore, to depend on what Mrs. K. tells me, and others who\nwere here. Mrs. K. gave me a full account on the Monday evening ; and\nMr. Smith, who was here most of Sunday afternoon and night, wrote out at\nthe time all that Mrs. K. told him and all that occurred while he was there.\nI have since had his notes and find that they agree with what Mrs. K. told me\nin every important particular ; where there is any difference I will note it. I\nhave perfect confidence that the facts as told me are entirely correct.\nOn the Saturday evening the servants were just going to have supper, at\nabout 10 o'clock, when one bell, I believe the bath-room, rang violently, and\nthey ran upstairs to Mrs. K. in a fright. (I might mention, by the way, that it\nis an additional evidence of the nature of the ringing that, I believe every\ntime, it has left no doubt in our minds directly that it is not the ordinary\nringing, it is so much more violent and sharp. )\nMrs. K. sent the cook immediately for the bell-hanger, as we had\npromised to do in case of recurrence of the ringing, and kept the housemaid\nin the dining-room with her. While they were there, and just as the cook\nhad got from the area steps into the garden, the bath-room bell rang violently\nagain. (The boys were all sound asleep.)\nNothing more occurred ; the bell-hanger could make nothing of it ; he\nstayed till 12 and then left. The housemaid was much upset by it, but\nI will return to that later on.\nNext day Mrs. K. took the boys to service, and when they came back\nthey found the following phenomena had occurred. The cook told her (and I\nbelieve she is perfectly trustworthy, as far as truthfulness goes) that soon\nafter they left the bells had begun to ring, two of them at least, and so\nviolently that at last she got the steps and got two of the bells off, the school\nroom and dining-room bells I think. After that they heard the wires pulled\nin the floor, &c.\nThey then went upstairs to do the bedrooms, Mary (the housemaid)\n\fAlleged Movements) &c.\nclinging to her, as she did all the time, being too scared to go about by her\nself. When they had got halfway up the \" knocking\" began, just as on the\nprevious occasion, and as I had heard it, in sets of two and three quickly\nrepeated raps, or rather blow's. They ran downstairs directly, in a fright. At\nlast they summoned courage enough to go up, and going into the bedroom\nwhere two of the boys sleep, they found the hair-brush belonging to one of\nthem on the floor by the fireplace, smashed in half. It was broken length\nways, somewhat thus,\nand only holding together by one thread. It had been used by the boy only\njust before he went out ; and he was much distressed when he saw it, and\nclearly it was all right when he had left it. The cook says she is certain Mary\nhad not been up at all since the boys left. The brush shows no signs of ill-\nusage except the breakage.\nThey went upstairs to the top floor, and were there some minutes, I\nsuppose, Mary keeping close to the cook all the time ; when they came down\nto the first floor they found a chair that had been in the bath-room (is always\nthere) a few steps downstairs ; i.e., it had got along the landing, about 15ft.,\ndown four steps, round a double corner, and down a few stairs of the main\nflight, where it was leaning backwards, on its \"hind legs,\" and resting on\nthe stairs above it. The below will give a ' ' ground plan \" of that part of the\nhouse.\nM\nLANDING\nDOWN\nft u\nSTAIRS PP\n\u25a0+-+\u25a0\nA. Bath-room door.\nB. Front bedroom door.\nC. My bedroom door.\nD. Mrs. K.'s bedroom door.\nThe arrows on the steps are supposed to point downwards, so that the\nshaded part of the floor is lower than the rest of the landing. It is about\n15ft. from the bath-room door to the top of the four stops.\nThe double CO shows where the chair was found.\nIn addition to this a chair had \"come\" out of Mrs. K.'s room and was\nsituated at the top of the stairs, I am not sure exactly where ; some things\nwhich had been on it, an apron and a scarf, were on the floor near.\nThey left them so till Mrs. K. came home, and she put the bath-room\nchair away, and set the other in the corner (O m the above plan). Mrs. K;\nreplaced also the apron and scarf, and went up again soon after dinner and\nfound them on the floor.\nMeanwhile the \" call \" bell at the top of the house rang, while dinner was\n\f168 F. W. H. Myers.\nbeing set, so after dinner the cook was sent to fetch the bell-hanger and also\na friend, Mr. S., who had promised to stay with them in case of need.\nDuring the afternoon Mrs. K. again and again replaced the things on the\nchair. She got her heaviest boot as being less easily moved than the scarf,\nand put the apron at the bottom, then the boot, then a cap on the top of all.\nWhen the cook had gone out Mrs. K. had Mary in the dining-room with\nher ; then went up herself, leaving her there, and found them off (the\napron and scarf she had found off twice at least, before she put the boot\non), the boot on the floor two steps above the level of where the chair was,\nthe cap near my bedroom door, the apron unfolded on the floor (near the\nchair, I suppose).\nMr. S. came at about 6.30, and Mary let him in and then went down\nstairs. Mrs. K. took him up and showed him the boot, &c, and they re\nplaced them on the chair.\n(Mr. S. wrote \"boots\" all through, instead of boot. He says he\nthought there was a pair joined together, but had not noticed particularly.\nThat is the only point of difference all through between his notes and what\nMrs. K. told me.)\nThen he and Mrs. K. went to the top floor to see that all was right,\nhaving carefully shut the three bedroom doors. A, B, C in the sketch.\nThey were there for about two minutes, and within hearing and all but\nwithin sight of the landing below. They then came down and found the three\ndoors wide open, and the chair just at the top of the stairs, that is, having\nmoved about three feet. The things were on the chair.\nAbout this time the bell-hanger came. They again moved the chair back\nand took him into my bedroom to tell him about it ; they were there about\none minute, and came out ; they found the boots and cap halfway downstairs.\nOnce Mrs. K. found the things still on the chair, but the apron on the top\nof the boot, instead of vice versa ; she is certain of this.\nMr. Smith also saw a drawer in the servants' room which the cook says\nhad been shut. She said the night before that she thought something had\nbeen moved in her room, and when she went up to fetch the bed down to\nMrs. K.'s room at night she said she would leave the drawer open and see if\nthose things were moved in the morning, or something to that effect ; when\nshe went in the morning she found the drawer shut, as far as the contents,\nwhich were sticking out (as though it had been shut carelessly), would allow.\nShe was certain that Mary had not been upstairs in the interval.\nThe last of these occurrences upstairs was about 8.20 p.m. Mrs. K. went\nupstairs with Mary (who dared not go anywhere by herself that day) and\nsaw the things on the chair as usual, and saw that they were not touched by\nMary ; when they came down the cap was on the floor close to my bedroom\ndoor.\nDuring the afternoon the bell-wires were pulled more than once under\nthe dining-room floor ; the bells were off, so of course there was no ringing.\nAfter tea the proceedings began downstairs. The cook came up at about\n7.45 and said that her hamper, which had stood on a chair in the passage,\nhad been moved on to the floor by the door. They all went downstairs and\ninspected the premises and came up, leaving the two servants below. Very\nsoon afterwards the cook missed the coal-scuttle, and found it in the middle\n\fAlleged Movev^nts, &c.\nof the scullery floor. Mr. S. is certain it was not there when he looked\njust before. There is no passage through the scullery and no coals or fire\nthere, so that the servants never take the scuttle through there, else one\nwould naturally suppose they had set it down there and forgotten it.\nSoon after, Mary's scarf or muffler was wanted, and it had disappeared.\nIt had been hanging over the bannisters at the foot of the kitchen stairs.\nThe bell-hanger was going round to inspect the place soon after, and found it\nat the end of the conservatory (that is, on the floor above the kitchen). He\nseemed to be struck especially by this, feeling sure that no one had come up\nstairs then.\nThe wires pulled a little under the dining-room floor that evening.\nNothing further happened after Mary left the house at 8.30 ; the bell-\nhanger stayed all night, sitting up. Nothing has occurred since then.\nOf course any one of the above movements by itself must necessarily\nappear incredible and ridiculous, or rather (since the facts are certain), it\nwould be absurd to suppose any extraordinary cause, and one would suppose\nthere had simply been some oversight. Taken altogether, however, and in\nconnection with the bell-ringing, &c. , I think they are of much more im\nportance.\nI cannot help now connecting the occurrences with the housemaid ;\nthough perhaps, since there is no direct evidence to that effect, it may not\nappear so to others, and an outsider would be able to judge that better. Of\ncourse I do not want in the least to let her know I think this, though I am\nafraid she begins to suspect it herself at times, as she naturally, finding that\nthe things never happen when she is away, puts things together, and has\nsaid it seems a strange thing that it should be so.\nI am, as I have said, perfectly certain that she had nothing to do volun\ntarily with the bell-ringing ; indeed, the more I think of it the more I am\nconvinced that it would be literally impossible for her to ring the bells as\nthey were rung, even apart from any necessity to conceal the method of\ndoing so.\nIf any further proof of her freedom from complicity were needed, her\nstate on the Saturday night would be enough to convince anyone. She was\ndelirious all night, at least till four in the morning ; she slept in Mrs. K.'s\nroom, and Mrs. K. and the cook sat up with her all night, and had often to\nhold her down ; at one time she got up and would have gone out of the room\nhad she not been prevented ; she was clearly asleep, though most of the\ntime her eyes were wide open, I suppose in the ordinary \" somnambulist\"\nstate. She talked incessantly all night, very much about the bells, &c, and\nin such a way as to show she was completely alarmed and terrified at it. She\nalso went through all her week's work, they said, talking about everything, and\ncoming to Sunday she went through almost the whole of the Church Service,\ngiving the responses and always leaving time for the clergyman to do his part ;\nshe sang four hymns all through, intoned the Te Deum, went through the\nLitany, and started on the (alternate verses of the) Psalms, but I suppose\ndid not remember them, for she did not complete them ; then she left about\n20 minutes for the sermon ! They thought she had gone off to sleep, but\nshe came out with an Amen, or something which showed what had been in\nthe interval ; then she greeted her friends in her ordinary tone of voice ; in\n\f176 F. TP\", H. Myers.\nfact, she acted the whole of what she would have done at the time. She did,\nby the way, let out one small secret about her work which she would not\nwillingly have done, so that I think anyone would be convinced that had she\nhad any hand in the production of the phenomena she must have given a hint\nof it ; however, I must repeat that this additional evidence was certainly not\nneeded.\nOne might have thought she moved the things in a somnambulic state ;\nbut they all feel certain that it would have been impossible for her to have\ncome upstairs and done most of the things, when they were perfectly within\nhearing and almost within sight, without its being known. Besides this,\nthere is direct evidence that she had been in the dining-room once at least\nall the time when one of the movements took place ; besides the fact that\nin the morning prior to the breaking of the brush, &c, she had actually\nbeen with the cook entirely, being afraid to leave her.\nIn addition to this the bath-room door, one of those opened when Mr.\nSmith was upstairs, could not bo opened by the handle without being\nhammered with the hand at the top at the same time, since, when pushed any\nwhere in the middle, the top stuck ; if, however, the top was pushed with the\nrest, no doubt there would have been no need to strike the top. I merely\nmention this because it struck them at the time that it was conclusive\nevidence to them that no one had been up to open it, else they would have\nheard the noise.\nThe housemaid was sent home next evening (Sunday), as they were quite\nafraid she would have brain fever if she passed another such night.\nYou will see that the occurrences have taken place almost always, if not\nalways, when she has been in a state of nervous excitement ; the servants\nwere both rather nervous when I was to go out for the Sunday, and in the\nprevious instance she had been upset iti her nerves for some days previously.\nShe is a young girl and has never been out to service before, and I had only\nhad her a few weeks prior to the first occurrence of these manifestations.\nI shall be very glad to give any assistance I am able towards investiga\ntion, and shall be pleased if anyone should wish to stay for a night or so to\nreceive them ; of course I have no means of anticipating any recurrence,\nbut you may wish someone to see the position of the bells, &c, and I\nshall be glad to do anything to facilitate an inquiry.\nNovember 23rd, 1887.\nDear Sir,\u2014I am afraid my last letter conveyed a slight misapprehension,\njudging from Mr. G. A. Smith's letter of November 14th. I did not intend\nto convey the impression that my servant had left permanently or for any\nlength of time ; she only went for one night, and returned the next day.\nSince that time nothing further has occurred ; and unfortunately for\ninvestigation, i.e., as far as asking anyone to come for the purpose is con\ncerned, one of my pupils is ill with a slight attack of scarlet fever, which\nwould, of course, make it rather awkward to give full facilities for investiga\ntion ; still, of course, it will not be long, I hope, before that is quite got rid of,\nand if we should have any further occurrences I shall be glad to telegraph to\nyou, only, of course, these things are apparently so sporadic that one can\nnever tell how long they are going to last when they once begin, as far as one\ncan judge from the previous experience.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 171\nOne thing within the last few days has afforded, perhaps, some evidence as\nto the nature of the bell-ringing, or may do. In preparing the room for the\npatient mentioned above we attached a cord to the bell-wire which projects\nfrom the cornice about two inches or less, so as to have communication with\nthe bell ; but they found that the bell did not ring, and I have little doubt\nthat the wire is broken. Under present circumstances I must postpone\nhaving the bell-hanger till we can have him safely, but when he examines it,\nit may throw some light on the subject. The wire appears once again (under\nthe bath) before it reaches the bell, and there I find it is perfectly right, and\nin full communication with the bell, nor is there any sign when pulling\nbachivards at that point of any breakage ; hence I think it follows that,\nhowever the wire was broken, it could not have been done by pulling in that\nplace, and we know that the \" handle \" (i.e., the inch or two of wire in the\nbedroom) was not pulled, so I think as far as one can see no person could have\nbroken it there. I should say that I know it was all right at the time when\nthe bells \" rang,\" for I tried it by means of a pole with a hook at the end\n(it can hardly be reached without something of the sort), and they did not\nbreak it when tying the cord on, for the bell did not ring once. Certainly,\njudging from the way in which the bells rang, it is not surprising if a wire\nbroke ; however, as soon as possible I will have it seen to.\nI think I gave some account of the way in which I tried to make it certain\nthat neither of the servants had anything to do (mechanically) with ringing\nthe bells ; and certainly I proved it if the evidence of one's senses has any\nweight. With regard to the other occurrences I will endeavour to state\nclearly whatproof there is of this. First, however, I may mention one or two\nadditional facts about the bell-ringing. I did not lay much stress on this in\nmy first letter, as I had not been able to speak to the witness referred to, but\nI have lately seen him (the brother of my cook, whom, I believe, I referred to\nas having been fetched by her to stay in the house with the housemaid while\nsiie went for us, when the \" knocking\" was going on). He tells me that he\nwas standing with the housemaid on the front door-step for some time while\nthe bells were ringing, and no one else (except the boys, who were upstairs) in\nthe house, and that he is certain she was not and could not be ringing them.\nThey went there simply because they did not like staying in the house while it\nwas going on. I understood him to say that he is not sure that there was any\nknocking while they were there. He says that when he was down in the\nkitchen the knocking was clearly in the floor above, i.e., the dining-room\nfloor, which corresponds with my own experience. At other times he says it\nwas in various parts of the house.\nThe other thing is that I am not sure whether I called particular atten\ntion to the time when one of the bells rang on Saturday night (November\n5th) ; that was, I think, as clear evidence as possible that neither servant had\nanything to do with it. Mrs. K. had the housemaid in the dining-room\nwith her while the cook went for the bell-hanger ; and while they were both\nin the dining-room, and the cook had just got to the top of the steps outside\nthe house, the bath-room bell rang violently, so loudly that the cook started\nand turned round and made some exclamation.\nWith regard to the other class of phenomena, I do not think Mrs. K.\ntook particular means to have clear proof that the servants were distinctly\n\f172 F. W. H. Myers.\nwatched and unable to have done the things (assuming that, being hysterical,\nthey might have done so unconsciously), except in one case. I have\ninquired closely into that and I think it is definite enough. She tells me\nthat on the Sunday afternoon there was at least one time when she knew the\nmovements of all in the house, when the things were moved off the chair. It\nwas when the cook went for Mr. Smith. Mrs. K. saw her come downstairs\nand saw that the things were on the chair ; then she called for the house\nmaid to come up from the kitchen and be with her in the dining-room, and\nshe came up then, only going into the school-room on the way, so that Mrs.\nK. (standing in the hall) saw that she did not go upstairs. They sat in the\ndining-room for some minutes, and then Mrs. K. went out, leaving the house\nmaid in the dining-room, and found the boot on the floor two steps higher\nthan the landing where the chair was, the cap near my room door, and tho\napron on the floor. She says she is certain she had Mary under her eye all\nthe time from when she came up from the kitchen. The boys were quietly in\nthe school-room, and beyond the bell-ringing, knew nothing of the occur\nrences all the time.\nI wish they could have given clearer proof as to the whereabouts of the\nservants at other times. Both Mrs. K. and Mr. Smith were absolutely\ncertain no one could have come upstairs when they were above, and when\nthey were in my room with the bell-hanger ; this, however, is not, of course,\ndirect proof that no one did. I believe, however, the one case given above to\nbe satisfactory evidence, so far as it goes.\nI might mention that when the bell-hanger came he very wisely did set\nhimself to make sure of that, and so he turned the gas down and sat in a\nloom on the top of the stairs to watch if the housemaid came up ; unfortu\nnately the cook took the same idea into her head at the same time, and sat\nat the bottom of the stairs, neither of the two knowing of the other's being\nthere, so that between them they defeated their own ends, \u2014at any rate the\nhousemaid did not come up when they were there, but I don't think they\nwere there long, so that is not much evidence in her favour.\nI am not sure if you wished me to tabulate instances in connection with\nthe bell-ringing and knocking to show that the servants were watched carefully.\nIf so, I will do so. I did this, however, in so many different ways that I\ndid not take account of them all, and cannot trust my memory for all the\ndetails, so that I should only give the five or six cases of which I took special\nnote in this regard. If I can make the evidence clearer by doing so I will\ntabulate the cases that I know of which are certain, of all kinds.\nMr. D.'s housekeeper, Mrs. K., confirms as follows :\u2014\nMr. D. having read over the account to me of tho occurrences which\ntook place in this house, I find that they agree with my recollection entirely.\nApril 3rd, 1890.\nIn a further letter (April 4th, 1890) Mr. D. adds : \"In my letter of\nNovember 23rd, 1887, I mentioned the fact of one of the bell-wires being out\nof order. I should say that upon examination it was found to be not broken,\nbut only fixed so tightly that it could not be pulled by the handle. This\ndoes not alter the case in any way, except that I had assumed the breakage\nto have been caused by the ringing ; if the fixing were caused by it, it amounts\n\fAlleged Movements, <&c. 173\nto the same thing practically ; if not, it is clear evidence that the ringing did\nnot take place from the handle.\"\nGroup A. Case X. (S. 8.)\nI go on to another case of a more prolonged and complex kind.\nAccount of Physical Phenomena Obtained in a Family Circle.\nProfessor Alexander, of the University of Rio de Janeiro, is well-\nknown to me, and I have also made the acquaintance of Mr. and Mrs.\nDavis and of the two children. I feel confident that the following\nnarratives have been written with candour and care. Mr. Davis\noccupies a responsible position as a telegraphist. The power of the\nchildren has not, I believe, returned.\nIn the following narration of phenomena that occurred in a family circle\nat Rio de Janeiro, a difficulty is felt in presenting the evidence so as to give\na right impression of its value. Facts isolated from the series to which they\nbelong are, like quotations without their context, apt to be misleading. And\nyet much in such cases as the following is of too private a nature for publicity.\nThere are names and circumstances that concern outside people, and that\nmust not in consequence be mentioned ; and there is, as will be readily under\nstood, much that is too intimate to be referred to, even in what regards\nourselves. This consideration leads me to exclude what is after all of small\nimportance\u2014the messages themselves, and to limit myself to as fair a de\nscription as possible of the physical phenomena through which they were\nobtained.\nAbout the middle of 1888 we received in Rio the visit of the notorious\nHenry Slade, who, after an unsuccessful stay of a few weeks, left us to go to\nBuenos Ayres, whence he returned to Rio after about six weeks' absence.\nHe then seemed to be more fortunate in his sittings ; and, although in this\naccount I should prefer refraining from even a passing mention of public\nmediumship, it is only just to attribute to him the great interest which was\nthen kindled in psychical phenomena, and perhaps the awakening of the\npower through which they were obtained. Mr. Davis, whose acquaintance I\nmade at the time of Slade's first stay among us, was incited to form a circle\nat home. He was living in a small country house, which stood alone on the\nside of a hill overlooking the seashore ; but in the month of November, 1888,\nhe moved to a residence at the foot of the hill, and much nearer the sea.\nWhile Slade was in Buenos Ayres, some 25 or more daily sittings were held\nby Mr. Davis without the least result.\nAt last, on August 14th, some slight manifestations were obtained with a\ntolerably good proof of identity, and, on their rapidly increasing in power\nand frequency, I was kindly invited to form part of the circle. The sitters who\nthenceforward composed it were Mr. Davis, Mrs. Davis,theirdaughters, C. and\nA. [who were respectively twelve and a-half and nine and a-half years old],\nMrs. Z. , their maternal grandmother, and myself. To these we may add a Mr.\nX., one of Mr. Davis's friends, who, however, was not quite so regular in his\nattendance. Outsiders were admitted some three times\u2014just often enough to\n\f174 F. W. H. Myers.\nshow us that, although ready believers in the greatest marvels, their exclusion\nwas in general a wise measure. One of them, an illiterate Brazilian, whose\nmediumship we wished to try, stopped all real phenomena, and, dozing off\ninto a somnambulic sleep, told us that St. Bernard was present. Another\nbecame, apparently, self-mesmerised, and acted foolishly. The third, an\nold friend of Mr. Davis's, saw some weak manifestations, which were quite\nsufficient to surprise and awe him. The testimony of the latter might be\nobtained, but would be of slight importance. The evidence depends almost\nentirely on the members of the circle, and must be measured by their\ncompetence as observers and reputation for probity.\nIn the latter part of August and during the ensuing months proof came\nupon proof of the reality of the so-called psychic force, and of the strange self-\nassertive intelligence that accompanies it. Heavy objects were moved\nwithout conscious effort on our part, and sometimes without any kind of\ncontact. What seemed to be direct writing came on the walls and in closed\nbooks, and this was, moreover, obtained on slates under the more exact\nobservation of the regular sittings. Raps were very frequent, and ranged\nfrom the lightest taps to the heaviest blows. Impressions of fingers, and\nonce that of a foot, were supernormally made on flour. Clairvoyance, and in\na lesser degree clairaudience, were developed ; and the touches and grasp of\nhands, not seemingly belonging to any of the sitters, were sometimes felt\neven by myself. Marked characteristics of individuality were maintained\nthroughout in each and all of the media of manifestation ; and in some\ninstances there were more decided indications that the intelligence at work was\nnot all referable to the subconscious cerebration of the persons present. The\nphenomena came at first in season and out of season ; the instruments through\nwhich they were evolved were simple English children, and their only effect\nwas a natural elation at their occurrence, and the quickening on our part of\nthe powers of observation and reasoning by the stimulus of curiosity^ After\ngrowing in intensity,and giving us reason to expect still more wonderful mani\nfestations, the power at length declined so much that it was at one time\nreduced to mere automatic writing. This coincided with the change of\nresidence, but was, I think, still more to be attributed to the heat of an\nexceptionally bad summer. As it grew cool again the power revived, but\nnever reached the pitch to which it had attained in 1888, and on June 4th,\n1889, the coming of Mr, Davis's family to England put an end to our\nsittings.\nNow, from first to last there was nothing that could with any justice be\nreferred to morbid conditions of the nervous system, whether in the children\nthemselves, or in the adults who observed them ; nor were any of the sitters\nduring these occurrences in any other than an apparently normal state of\nconsciousness. Warned by failures and disappointments in other quarters,\nboth Mr. Davis and I were disposed to subject whatever happened to\nrigorous inquiry, and to judge each single phenomenon on its own\nmerits.\nProm the notes taken at the time and from my own memory, corrected by\nthat of the other sitters, I will now endeavour to give the details of our\nphenomena ; and for the sake of order, I will classify them, not so much\naccording to their sequence in time, as according to their kind,\n\fAlleged Movenients, &c.\nMovements op Heavy Bodies Attributable to Psychic Fouce.\nAt the first successful sitting of August 14th, at which Mr. and Mrs.\nDavis and the two children C. and A. were present, table-tilting took place,\nthe hands of the sitters being, according to their usual custom, joined on the\ntable. On taking down the letters indicated by the tilts, the name of a\nrelative long deceased was given as Fanny Z., and this was insisted on,\nalthough the sitters supposed it to be Frances. Mrs. Z. , who was not in the\nroom at the time, was then called in, and she affirmed that Fanny had\nalways been the familiar name of the deceased, although her real name was\nFrances. The minds of the sitters were positively set against the name given\nby the table, until it was corroborated by Mrs. Z.\nThenceforward the power, as before said, developed rapidly ; and mani\nfestations were made spontaneously, or could be had for the asking at any\nhour of the day. It was shortly after this first outbreak of phenomena that\nI myself went up by invitation to Mr. Davis's house to take part in a sitting.\nAt tea the dining-room table, round which were seated Mr. Davis, Mrs. Davis,\ntheir five little daughters, Mrs. Z., and I, swayed backward and forward, or\nrose at one end in sudden emphatic movements, which often meant, according\nto the usual \" yes \" or \"no\" signals, approval or disapproval of assertions made\nin the conversation. During this irregular proceeding of the table the two\nelder girls, C. and A., from whom the power seems to have been principally\ndrawn, sat quite still, one on each side of their mother, who was\nfavourably placed to detect any interference on their part. The same thing\noccurred on other occasions when I was present, and, as Mr. Davis assured me\nat the time, it was even stronger at those meals in which the members of the\nfamily were alone. The table, in fine, acted like a restless, living creature\nendowed with human intelligence. The tone adopted in conversing with\nthese strange influences was rather a bantering one ; and once, on my retiring\nfrom the room after tea, the table ran after me, and made a decided attempt\nto hem me in. C. was at the moment the only other person present in the\nroom ; and, as far as I could see,she did not even touch the table,much less did\nshe push it. On another occasion the table, while all were seated round it, rose\nand fell staidly and deliberately,in a manner, that is to say, so different from\nits usual behaviour that we at once supposed the presence of a new influence.\nThe alphabet was called for, and repeated ; and the name of a lady was given\nwho in former years had been a personal acquaintance of Mrs. Z.'s. The\nothers had merely heard of her. Her age, which I must not mention here, as\nit might give a clue to her identity to surviving relatives, was then spoken\nof ; but a mistake was made in the number of years, against which the table\nimmediately protested, correcting Mrs. Z. in the units, which, it seems, were\n5 and not 4. Mrs. Z. at once acknowledged that her memory had betrayed\nher, and that the invisible influence was right.\nOther phenomena of a spontaneous character, or that came at our desire,\nwere still more conclusive of the presence of psychic force than the rather\nuncomfortable proceedings of the tea-table. The high chair in which Amy,\na child then 13 months old, was seated, was moved backwards and forwards\nabout 10 or 12 inches, between the table and the wall, this being done so\nabruptly that the chair was sometimes forced partly under the table, and\nthreatened to fall backwards. The child, instead of being alarmed, chuckled\n\f176 F. W. H. Myers.\nand laughed, though we older people were sometimes rather anxious lest she\nshould be hurt. At our request the chair would be righted, and the violence\nof the movement moderated. On the right hand of the child was seated Mrs.\nZ. ; on the left A. The chair, while moving, kept parallel with the table,\ni.e., it was not twisted round as would be the case if it were drawn forward\non one side only by the foot of either of the neighbours ; and it generally slid\nacross, and not along the boards of the floor, which, as usual in Brazilian\nhouses, were uncarpeted. I have tried moving the same chair myself, when\nseated beside Amy, and find that, although I have rather more than the\naverage strength in my lower limbs, the push can be given only with consider\nable difficulty, and has the effect of turning the chair half round. If, then,\ninstead of having, as is now the case, every reason to trust Mrs. Z. and her\ngranddaughter, I had the best founded motives for mistrust, I should\u2014\nin the absence of all visible mechanism\u2014have considered that particular\nphenomenon to be a genuine one.\nAnother noteworthy incident occurred with a favourite dog, called Tiny,\nwhich, according to its time-honoured custom, was seated on a chair, which\nstood away from the table near the wall. Nobody being near it, I jokingly\nchallenged the invisible influence so to move the chair that the dog might be\nobliged to jump down. Nothing happened for a minute or so, when the dog\nleft the chair\u2014apparently of its own accord. Two or three seconds elapsed\nafter it had sprung to the ground ; and then the chair tilted before us all.\nIn the same way a child's swing, hanging in a nook of the room, was at my\ndesire subjected to a slight but very visible oscillation, which was closely\nwatched by Mr. Davis and myself. There was, it is true, an open window at\nthe back ; but, as we carefully noted at the time, no perceptible breeze cam\u00a9\nthrough it ; the temperature inside and outside the house was more or less\nequal, the air on the verandah being that of a characteristically motionless\nBrazilian night.\nAn account of a phenomenon of levitation suggested another tea-table\nexperiment. I requested C, who was seated two places from me, her\nlittle sister D. being between us, to place her hand on the back of my\nchair, which she did, touching it with apparent lightness. The chair began\nat once to sway from side to side, and continued to do so after I had taken\nmy feet from the ground. There was an application of great power, sufficient,\nindeed, to give ample proof of the action of psychic force, if not to lift me\nfrom the floor. All this while C. sat immovable ; and it was very manifest\nthat she made not the slightest effort. The next evening Mr. X. , who is very\nmuscular, took C.'s seat, while I retained my own ; and he then tried to\nproduce the same effect under exactly the same conditions, with the result\nthat his chair slid back, while mine remained immovable. My weight, which\nI suppose has not changed to any considerable degree since then, I find to be\n13st. 61b.\nSome other experiments with tables were made under the more direct\nobservation of the regular sittings, at which I soon became a very constant\nattendant. On one occasion a light three-footed table was inverted ; and my\nhands, with those of Mr. Davis, Mrs. Davis, and the two girls, were lightly\nplaced on each of the feet. Care was taken to see that no one did more than\njust touch the feet of the table ; and, under these conditions, it sprang rapidly\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 177\nfrom the floor into the lap of one of the sitters, and thence to the floor again,\nrepeating this manoeuvre for each of us in turn. In the Thursday evening\nseances it was common for the table to place itself in the necessary position on\nour sitting down to it, either immediately before or after our hands had been\nplaced on its surface. These movements, however, nearly always took us by\nsurprise, and, as we had in view the study of far more important phenomena,\nwe did not subject them to any very exact tests.\nAn interesting case of apparent alteration in the weight of a table was\nobserved by Mr. X. when C. was standing by. At his own request, and\nwhile he held it in his hands alone, it became alternately very light and very\nheavy, so much so that, although it was nothing more than an ordinary card\ntable, he was more than once obliged to put it down.\nI will include here the account of an interesting phenomenon witnessed\nbeforehand with Slade, but which, in the case of a professional medium, is\nvery liable to be attributed to conjuring. Having one day walked over the\nhill to visit Mr. Davis, I found on arriving that the children were just finishing\ntheir morning lessons. It occurred to me, as I saw the slates and books on\nthe table, that I might try with A. for the disappearance of a solid object ;\nand, when we were left alone in the room, we held together, at my suggestion,\na slate on which a book had been placed, keeping it, according to precedent,\njust under the table. The slate was twisted round with some force, and the\nbook fell to the ground. So far it was a failure. 1 then took a slate pencil of\nabout the usual length, which was lying on the table, placed it on the slate,\nand again held the latter,with the help of the little medium, out of sight in the\nshade of the table. After a few moments the slate was drawn out by us\u2014\nthe pencil had gone. We looked for it on the floor, under the table, but in\nvain. On replacing the slate in position, the pencil apparently fell on to it.\nI resolved to try once more ; and the second time, under exactly the same\nconditions, the pencil disappeared. This time, besides looking for the pencil\nelsewhere, I obliged A. to shake her arms ; and, calling Mr. Davis from the\nnext room, I explained what had occurred, and asked him to take part in the\nsearch. Equally unsuccessful for the first few moments, he at length passed\nhis hand inside the crossbeam of the table that runs between the legs, and\nthe pencil came into his hand as if put there. Now, at that particular spot\nthe crossbeam was smooth and vertical ; the pencil itself was almost point\nless, and could not have been pressed into the hard vinliatico wood of which\nthe table was made. Add to this that the experiment was to the little girl\nan entirely novel one, and that she was under my own observation in broad\ndaylight, and could hardly have let go of the slate for any appreciable length\nof time without my perceiving it. Her other hand was joined with mine on\nthe table.\nRaps.\nFrom the first outbreak of the phenomena raps were the principal means,\nused for announcing the supposed spirit presence. They came on the floor,\non the table, arid, more rarely, on the walls, in signals which from the beginning\nwere sharply individualised for each separate influence, the same individuality\nmaintaining its characteristics throughout the sittings. As before stated,\nthey varied in loudness from hardly perceptible ticks up to resounding blows,\nsuch as might be struck by a large wooden mallet. In the quality of some.\nN\n\f178 F. W. H. Myers.\nof those sounds there were also marked and persistent distinctions. These\ndifferences are given, as far as they can be represented in dash and dot, in\nthe following list, taken from Mr. Davis's notebook, which is, however, by no\nmeans complete. The size of the marks roughly represents the comparative\nloudness of the raps :\n', - \u2014 \u2014 jo.\n-. a n u _\nIS.\nI - I ; \u2014 \/ II\ni to 17. \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\\nNow, I hold it to be extremely improbable that any of us, including even\nsuch a practised telegraphist as Mr. Davis himself, should be able to retain\nin his memory for any length of time, at least without special study, such a\nvariety of sounds so as to give them at the end of a series of sittings in exactly\nthe same way in which they were given at the beginning. This individuality\nof the raps was early forced upon our notice ; and we learnt to recognise them\nwhen heard, though none of us could reproduce more than a very few from\nmemory.\nOne evening in the month of September, 1888, Mr. Davis went into the\nroom of the two elder girls, where A. was already in bed and asleep, taking\nC. with him. They had no candle ; but through the ventilating aperture\nover the door came in sufficient light to show the position of the persons\nand objects in the room. Both sat down on the bedside ; C. took\noff her slippers ; and heavy blows, like those that might be dealt by a muffled\nsledge hammer, came on the floor. Mr. Davis then obliged C. to sit\non the floor with him, placing her feet on his knees, and holding her two\n1 More is figured here than mere dash and dot could give : the vertical strokes\nrepresent a sharp sound ; the horizontal ones a sound more or less prolonged, accord\ning to the lengths given. The intervals between the strokes show approximately the\nintervals between the raps that made up each signal ; and the thickness of the strokes\nindicates the comparative loudness. The blot, which we were told to put for No. 6,\nstands for a very heavy thud, usually dealt on the table.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 179\nhands in his own. The same blows came, but with even more intensity ; and\nthey were finally requested by Mrs. Davis from another room not to make so\nmuch noise, as they would wake the children who were sleeping in other\nparts of the house. The blows seemed to Mr. Davis to shake the whole\nbuilding. Mr. X. also witnessed similar phenomena on another occasion.\nOn the night of April 25th, 1889, Mr. Davis had occasion to go into his\ndaughters' room, where A. was lying asleep, and heard rapping going on\nall round her. At the sittings the raps were, of course, used as a medium for\nmessages, in which they seemed to us to be more reliable than the automatic\nwriting, and equally so with the direct writing.\nOn April 18th, 1889, at one of our Thursday evening sittings, when the\nroom had been thoroughly darkened, nine or ten silent movements made by\nMr. Davis's finger were reproduced in raps on the floor at the other end of the\nroom ; but, on his calling our attention to this, and trying to obtain it again,\nthe attempt failed. Another experiment was, however, more successful.\nMr. Davis tapped out the alphabet from A to Z and the numbers from 1 to 0\nin Morse signals. At each letter given the same sound was exactly imitated,\nthe raps coming again near the elder girl on the floor at the other end of the\nroom. The imitation was, indeed, so perfect that Mr. Davis declared it was\nhis own \" sending.\" Nevertheless, no message was given in Morse signals,the\nreason affirmed being that, as the medium did not know telegraphy, they\ncould not use her for that purpose. Now, Mr. Davis was the only person\npresent who knew anything at all about Morse signals ; and 1 found after\nwards, on trying, that only after repeated failures could I succeed in tapping\nthem out myself. In the raps that came on this occasion one only mistake\nwas made at the letter Q, which was, however, correctly given the second\ntime. All the other letters were smartly reproduced without the slightest\nhesitation. On other occasions, and once or twice when Mr. P. was present,\nMorse signals were in the same way struck out by violent blows on the table,\neven after the legs of the older sitters had been stretched across under the\ntable to preclude the possibility of any kicking by the children. But the\nprincipal guarantee of the genuineness of the phenomenon was doubtless\nthe fact that the blows imitated Morse signals, the more so that Mr. X.\nfound, when he tried alone, that, although he knew telegraphy well, he\ncould not kick out the signals with his feet.\nI may say that, in spite of the many little proofs we had obtained of the\ngenuineness of our phenomena, my attitude and that of Mr. Davis towards\neach repetition of the manifestations was always one of watchful suspicion.\nProtests were often made by the influences at work ; and it was affirmed that\nwe hindered their action by our persistent doubts. One Sunday evening, on\nour sitting down to the accustomed seance,raps cavne on the table immediately ;\nand I profited by them to ask if our invisible guest would choose the chapter\nin the New Testament, which was always read on those occasions. The raps\nanswered \" Yes,\" and asked for the alphabet, whereupon Mr. Davis wrote\nthe letters on a slate, and ran over them, pencil in hand, while he carefully kept\nthem out of view of the other sitters. Raps came at certain letters ; but they\nmade no sense, so that he passed the slate to me, asking me to try in my\nturn. I held the slate close to my face in such a manner as to allow nobody\nto see it but myself, and at the beginning made a pause with the pencil at\nX 2\n\f180 F. W. H. Myers.\nthe first four or five letters ; but, soon recollecting that anyone watching me\nmight count the movements of the pencil and so be aware of the letter to\nwhich I was pointing, I changed to a continuous movement, and thus raps\ncame at M, A, R, and Q. It was evidently Mark ; and the sixth chapter and\nfifth verse being further indicated, we found on opening the Bible : \"And He\ncould there do no mighty work, save that He laid His hands upon a few sick\nfolk, and healed them.\" The sixth verse continues: \"And He marvelled\nbecause of their unbelief.\" Another chapter was also similarly chosen, in\nwhich there was an example of the power of faith ; but so many chapters\ncontain such examples that we cannot prove this to be anything more than a\ncoincidence. As none of us are in the habit of committing chapter and verse\nto memory, it was not at all likely we should be able to point out any one\npassage ; and, indeed, previous knowledge of the whereabouts of the above\nverses was denied by all. The letters obtained by Mr. Davis were close to\nthose obtained by me.\nAfter the trying hot season of 1888-9 the first thing that returned to us\nin joyous manifestations was the raps with all their old individuality.\nOther Sounds.\nA peculiar whistling sound was heard by some\u2014on one occasion coming\nfrom behind the curtains drawn before the verandah door, and on another,\nby Mrs. Z. in the garden path leading down to the gate, where she had been\nseeing some friends out. I mention this as it seems to me to be rather\nfrequent in physical manifestations. I cannot say that I have heard it\nmyself. The only other objective phenomenon of the kind worth recording\nis that of a note sounded in fulfilment of a promise on a closed piano, while\nwe were sitting at tea in the adjoining room. This was heard by Mrs. Davis\nand myself, we being both favourably placed to catch the sound. The note\nwas a faint one, but quite audible enough to leave no doubt as to its nature\nor the direction whence it came. At the time all the members of the\nhousehold were assembled round the table ; and the small adjoining room\nin which the piano stood was lighted, and was wholly visible with all its\ncontents\u2014at least to Mrs. Davis.\nDirect Writing.\nBut the most striking phase of our phenomena was the rapid develop\nment in the two girls of the direct from the automatic writing. The latter\ncame almost immediately after the first successful sitting, and the former,\nindeed, appeared about the same time on the walls and in closed books, but\nnot so as to fall under our direct observation. It was at a seance, held on\nSeptember 11th, 1888, Mr. Davis and his family being alone present, that a\nfirst mark was obtained on a slate held a la mode de Slade in the shade of a\ntable. On September 16th, I being also present, several detached words\nwere written in the same manner ; and on the 23rd of the same month our\nstance was an extraordinary success. C. , who was seated next to her father,\nheld a slate on which pencil dust had been scraped ; and it was hardly placed\nin position by her when it was pushed out by an apparently external force,\nand showed on its surface a lino stretching right across it. This was done\nrapidly time after time ; and on my objecting that possibly the line was\ncaused by drawing the slate against the angle of the table, it was thencefor\n\fAlleged Mcroements, &c. 181\nward lowered on being taken out so as to avoid all contact, and with exactly\nthe same result. Meanwhile A., seated at my right hand, held a slate\npencil, as if for automatic writing, but in such a manner that there was\nconstantly a distance of two or three millimetres between the point of the\npencil and the surface of the slate. The movement of the point was as\nimperceptible as that of the minute hand of a clock ; and thus were appar\nently precipitated on to the slate, and under my own eyes, letters and\nwords, which not only were far superior in execution to the child's usual\nhand, but would do honour to a practised writing master. C. , and more\nespecially A., soon began to obtain direct writing, either by holding the\nslate alone, or with other persons, in whole sentences, written apparently\nwith fine pencil dust, which was at first preferred as being easier to manage !\nAfterwards minute pieces of pencil were used ; but both with these and the\npencil dust the writing was effected silently, and very often away from the\npencil itself. If, as further experiments seem to show, the phenomenon\nwas a genuine one, the words found upon the slates must have been due to\nsome unknown process of precipitation. The influences themselves asserted\nthat materialised hands were formed for the purpose, though that, of course,\nit is more difficult to admit. With somewhat characteristic unseasonableness\nthe writing sometimes came at the back of slates lying on the table while\nMrs. Davis was superintending the children's lessons, and in this case no\npencil seems to have been used.\nWhen the power had thus reached sufficient intensity, some more\nconclusive tests were tried. On one occasion some 12 or 14 pieces of\npencil were placed on the slate ; and, on holding it under the table, writings\nwere done in every possible direction, corresponding more or less in number\n,with the pieces of pencil on the slate\u2014and this in a time far too brief to allow\n,of any fraudulent manipulation of the slate by the child herself. On another\noccasion I laid a clean slate in the centre of the table, placed with my own\nhand a minute piece of pencil on its upper surface, and covered it with\nanother slate, which was also first seen to be clean. Then all the persons\npresent, including the little medium A. , placed the tips of their fingers on\nthe upper slate, which began at once to slide backward and forward on the\nlower one, but never so much as to open them for more than an inch or so.\nAs we were sitting in full lamp-light with all our attention concentrated on\nthe slates, it was impossible that anyone should have written without being\nimmediately detected, yet on the upper surface of the lower slate near\nA.'s fingers there came writing, which was repeated several times.\nAnother and still stronger test was a reproduction by A. and myself\nalone of an experiment I had read of in Zollner's work. I put a small piece\nof pencil in the middle of the table ; then, taking a couple of clean slates, I\nplaced one of them over the pencil, and, with the little girl, held the other flat\nagainst the under surface of the table, as nearly as possible under the upper\nslate. In this position writing came at my request on that surface of the\nlower slate which was pressed against the table ' No previous warning was\ngiven that the experiment\u2014a novel one to the child\u2014was about to be tried ;\nand on the occasion I took care that it should exclude all possibilities of\nconscious or unconscious fraud.\nAfter the hot season the direct writing returned, but was never sufficiently\n\f182 F. W. H. Myers.\npowerful to allow of rigorous tests. It may be added that both this and the\nautomatic writing were often as well individualised as were the raps.\nApparent Materialisation of Hands and Feet.\nTouches were sometimes felt by the more sensitive, when at the sittings\neverybody's hands were upon the table ; and the characteristic cold breeze\nwhich usually precedes physical phenomena was frequently perceived by all\nof us. One evening at a dark seance in the lower house, while I held A.'s\nright hand under my left, the rest of the sitters being away from us on the\nother sides of the table, I felt small fingers, said to be those of a near relative,\nstroking the back of my hand. I at once inquired if Mr. Davis held A.'s\nother hand in his, and he replied affirmatively. C, whose hand joined\nmine on the right, was in her accustomed place just opposite me ; and the\nfingers felt seemed, from their position, to belong to a person standing on\nmy left side. Besides this, the hand that caressed mine was too small to\nbelong to any of the adults present, though it might well have been that of\nthe influence whose name was given.\nOn a previous occasion on the evening of September 6th, 1888, before the.\nfamily had moved, we had received what seemed to us an extremely good\nproof of the reality of temporarily formed hands and feet\u2014or, at least, of\nsimulacra of them. Mr. Davis, the two girls, and I were seated, each on one\nside of a small square table, in full lamp-light. We had been obtaining,\nspecimens of direct writing, and had noticed that in the pencil dust strewn\non the slate there were impressions of fingers that were, some larger, and\nothers smaller than those of the little medium. We therefore had in the\nflour box ; and I heaped flour on one of the slates, and smoothed it\ncarefully over. Mr. Davis then obliged his daughter, C. , to hold both her\nhands in the middle of the table, and, bidding her sit perfectly still, placed\nthe slate upon her knees. To prevent the thwarting action of too expectant\nattention I continued the reading of an American humourist, without much\nsuccess, however, in interesting either myself or the hearers in the contents\nof the book. Nevertheless, after an interval we were told to examine the\nslate ; and, on Mr. Davis's so doing, we found that it contained impressions\nof fingers. The flour was smoothed over again ; C. resumed her previous\nposition, and Mr. Davis again placed the slate on her lap. We begged that, if\npossible, the impression of a foot might be given as a more crucial test ; and,\nafter waiting for another short interval, we obtained our desire. When Mr.\nDavis brought the slate into the light, we all observed on it the delicate tracing\nof a naked, baby foot, such as would have been caused by lightly pressing it\nagainst the flour. There was also the mark of a large human finger sinking\nmore deeply into the flour. Both impressions were perfect in their kind.\nNow, none but the four persons mentioned were present in the room at the\ntime. All our hands were, as usual, on the table. The children's feet,\nencased in laced boots, were many sizes larger than the foot that caused the\nimpression ; and from first to last neither of the girls had the slightest chance\nof tampering with the slate. In automatic writing the impression was tri\numphantly claimed as that of the foot of a little relative of the D.'s who\nhad passed away in early infancy. Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Z., who had been\nabsent from the room during the evening, and could not, therefore, be\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 183\nsupposed to be under the influence of any collective hallucination induced by\nthe sitting, were then called in ; and they saw the impression as distinctly as\nwe did.\nClairvoyance.\nI do not know whether I should attribute to clairvoyance, or consider as\nan objective phenomenon, a beautiful, transparent,bluish light which was one\nevening seen by all, except Mr. Davis himself, playing on his left shoulder. At\nmy desire it moved to the right shoulder, but seemed to have some difficulty\nin staying there. Though there was no regular sitting, the room at the time\nwas partially darkened, but not enough to hinder us from plainly distinguish\ning the features of the persons present.\nThe two elder girls, and sometimes even the two younger ones, seemed\nto see spirit forms clairvoyantly. Once at that marvellous tea-table I\nwas much struck at the simultaneousness with which the former clapped their\nhands, burst into hearty laughter, and gave an identical account of some\ninvisible fun which was going on at the expense of their father. Again,\nwhen we were standing on the verandah one dark night, the slow measured\nbark of a dog, chained outside, attracted our notice. We saw it was gazing\nupward at something which Mr. Davis and I could not perceive. The girls,\nhowever, declared that they recognised a well-known spirit form,standing in\nfront of the dog ; and the bark was, indeed,expressive of much canine bewil\nderment. At a later date, when the family were living at the lower house,\nthe youngest girl, still hardly more than a baby,called her father's attention\nto somebody standing at the door. \" Man, man,\", she said ; but to other eyes\nno man was visible ; and at last, ere she could succeed in making him seo\nwhat to her eyes was so evident, her look changed to one of intense\nastonishment, and she uttered her usual \"All gone,\" which in her imperfect\nlanguage meant that something had disappeared. Now, her very generic\n\" man\" was at one time applied by her to me ; and it is just possible that she\nhad an hallucination of my person. The phantasm of a dog, which was seen\nby myself very indistinctly passing close to my knee at the same moment\nthat it was perceived by Mrs. Z. with all clearness, merits a passing mention.\nOn another occasion it was simultaneously seen by Mr. Davis and C. passing\nalong a passage. Such an appearance, if impinged on us by an outside\nintelligence, would probably have nothing more than symbolical import, and\nmight mean guardianship. The simultaneous perception of the apparition by\ntwo persons on each occasion, and the similarity, exact so far as could be\njudged, of the two separate visions are certainly interesting points.\nBut it was at one of our later sittings, held on April 11th, 1889, that\nwe obtained the best phenomena of this kind. We had darkened the room\ncompletely ; and throughout the seance a diffused light, in which the forms of\nthe persons seated round the table were just distinguishable, was alternated\nwith the most intense darkness. All saw this light, and at first we were inclined\nto attribute it to the candle burning in an adjoining room, where Mrs. Davis\nwas putting the younger children to bed. She shortly joined us, however,\nand, though all lights in the house were then extinguished, the phenomenon\ncontinued at what seemed regular intervals ; and soon the girls declared they\nsaw spirit forms, which succeeded each other at a certain place at the table.\nOn our asking C. to describe them she did so. Besides other descriptions\n\f184 F. W. H. Myers.\nof apparitions less remarkable or verifiable, one was given of her maternal\ngrandfather which was considered to be exact. It seemed, indeed, to Mrs.\nDavis and Mrs. Z. , who were the only ones who had known him in his earth-\nlife, to be complete. Mr. Davis, however, thought he had heard speak of a\nsword cut which his father-in-law had received on his forehead, and he also\nrecollected some mention of a cut on his lip. He, therefore, asked for some\nthing still more characteristic. On this, Mrs. Davis's memory reverted to a\nmutilated finger of the decedent, while Mrs. Z. 's mind was a blank, as she was\nunable to imagine what more could be required. The girl looked again for a few\nmoments, and then affirmed that she saw on the face of the apparition a\nwhite line crossing the nose and another stretching under the left eye. This\nwas exact. On making after inquiries, I found that neither of the ladies\nhad any recollection of having mentioned this circumstance either to Mr.\nDavis or the children ; and they believed it had lain latent in their memory\nfor many years. I examined the photographs of Mr. Z. with a magnifying\nglass, but could not find in them the slightest trace of any such mark.\nA daguerreotype, however, which I saw afterwards, has a very faint indi\ncation of a mark on the nose, that certainly would not be noticed or\nunderstood, unless very special attention were drawn to it, and an explana\ntion were given of what it was. The seam under the eye across the cheek,\nwhich was seen in its exact position, is given nowhere. As to the\nsword cut, it had never existed except in Mr. Davis's imagination.\nIn concluding this brief account of our phenomena,I may say that we were\nvisited by no Shakespeares or Byrons. Perhaps they did not think us\ncongenial. The influences purporting to be busy around us were, in general,\nsuch as would have felt the liveliest interest in the family had they been\nclothed in the flesh.\nI have laid some stress on the individuality of the manifestations. People\nin this life are commonly recognised by their acquaintances, even after a long\nabsence, by persistent habits in voice, bearing, facial expression and thought,\nand rarely by mere legal proofs of identity. Differentiation takes place in\nour most trivial habits ; and, perhaps, no two people ring a bell,or knock at a\ndoor in exactly the same way. The theory of a continued intelligent existence,\nin which imperfect means are onlyoccasionally offered for communication with\nthe world that is left behind, will always seem plausible to those who, like\nourselves, have been witnesses to the marked individuality maintained for\neach manifesting influence in physical phenomena, especially when, as in our\ncase, tricks of speech and pet names long forgotten are reproduced by\nmediums who in all probability never heard of them. The differences were\nevolved in the phenomena themselves, and not in the children, as would be\nthe case if it were a question of multiplex personality. Something, of course,\nwas drawn from them ; their normal personality was not always kept in the\nbackground ; but it was generally combined with elements foreign to their\nway of thinking, and sometimes with particulars which were unknown to\nthem. While the influences A, B, C were manifesting by raps, direct writing\nor apparitions, the little mediums, as I said in the beginning, would be, to\nall outward appearance, in their usual condition. Indeed, had any mental\ndisturbance been observed in them\u2014even if it were only temporary\u2014we\nshould have thought it high time to suspend our sittings.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 185\nOur supernormal experience also led us to place much more reliance on\nspontaneous messages than on answers elicited by questioning. The delicate\npsychic current seemed to be turned aside by too positive a frame of mind,\nand to be hindered,even in the physical manifestations,by distrust or expectant\nattention. We soon recognised this ; and, though we could never entirely rid\nourselves of all distrust, we may claim the merit of finally allowing the facts\nto prove themselves, and of interfering with them no more than was necessary\nfor satisfactory observation.\nThe matter of the messages was often trivial, which was partially owing\nto the playful tone which we adopted ourselves. Had our own remarks been\ntaken down at the time, I am afraid they would have been rated at no higher\nvalue. Often, however, messages were written of moral and even religious\nimport, which, whatever might have been their source, had simple merits of\ntheir own. These, of course, are nearly all of too private a nature to be\nfurther alluded to.\nThe frequent reference made to distrust of the children merely signifies\nthat, as they were the instruments for phenomena which in their public\naspect are largely mixed with fraud, and were subject to influences not well\nunderstood by us, we felt it to be our duty to^ourselves, and to those who\nmight care to examine the account of our experience, to guard jealously\nagainst the introduction of conscious or unconscious trickery. These con\nsiderations led us to be ever watchful\u2014even with the familiar members of our\nfamily circle. Speaking after great intimacy, I will add that the character\nboth of C. and A. is excellent. In all the ordinary relations of life\nthey are truthful and affectionate children ; and I am sure that they respect\nboth their parents far too much to make them the victims of wilful and\npersistent deception.\nAlfred Alexander.\n1889.\nMr. and Mrs. Davis corroborate this account as follows :\u2014\nAdditional Remarks on \" Account of Physical Phenomena observed\nin a Family Circle. \"\nIn his paper Professor Alexander gives so exhaustive an account of the\nphysical phenomena observed in our family circle that I feel I have very little\nto add. The various phenomena therein described were critically observed\nby us all with an earnest desire to arrive at the truth, and I have no doubt\nthat our extreme caution did in a great measure weaken the manifestations ;\nat the same time those actually observed with such care obtained a higher\nvalue in our estimation than more powerful ones loosely observed could have\ndone.\nThe paper professedly deals only with these physical phenomena, and lays\nbut little stress upon the intelligence manifested by their means ; yet, as it\ntouches upon the subject of the individuality of tilts, raps, and writing\u2014\nautomatic and direct\u2014I may,perhaps,be permitted to refer to this part of the\nsubject. When this individuality was forced upon our notice I made out a\nlist of the various sounds which were given us as the distinctive \"signals \" of\nthe communicating intelligences. Upon one of these \"signals\" being rapped\nor tilted out, the name corresponding thereto was asked for, and, by means of\n\f186 F. W. H. Myers.\nthe alphabet, spelled out ; and for a long time it was only upon reference to\nour list that we were able to verify their accuracy. Among scores of such\ninstances no error was ever detected. The same consistent identity was also\nnoticeable in the writings. The manifesting intelligences, A, B, C, &c. ,\nwould each assume a distinctive handwriting ; that assumed by A was never\nsigned by other than A, or that assumed by B, by other than B.\nBefore the advent of genuine raps I had to check a rather absurd tendency\nin the children to answer questions by tapping with their pencils on the\nslates. This, however, was literally above board.\nIn reference to the raps mentioned as having occurred in my daughter's\nbedroom I will state that my object in making this experiment was by a\ncrucial examination to satisfy myself that those heard on other occasions\nwere not due to conscious or unconscious simulation. After A. had retired\nfor the night and was asleep,1 and without mentioning my intention to anyone,\nI took C. into the room, and together we quietly sat on the bedside. After\nwaiting,perhaps five minutes, faint rappings were heard upon the floor. I then\nremoved my shoes\u2014no alteration. C. removed hers\u2014raps much louder,\nso loud as to awaken A. This led me to infer that by closer bodily contact\nwith the floor better conditions were obtained. I, therefore, made A.\nassume such a position in bed that she was entirely isolated from possible\ncontact with the bedstead\u2014arms outside clothes, and whole body perfectly\nquiet and under my direct observation\u2014while C. and I seated ourselves\non the floor, her feet resting on my knees, her two hands secured in mine.\nUnder these conditions thundering blows, causing the whole room to vibrate,\nwere obtained, answering questions and rapping out an intelligent message.\nThere was no candle or lamp alight in the room ; but the ventilating aperture\nover the door, which was a foot deep and of the same width as the door,\nadmitted sufficient light from the adjoining sitting-room to render everything\nperfectly visible.\nI can further corroborate all the details given respecting the impression\nof the little foot obtained at the sitting of September 6th ; but I think it ,\nimportant to add that slight tracings of the skin itself were perceptible on\nthe flour.\nFrom the time that decided intelligence was recognisable in connection\nwith the phenomena, persistent efforts were made by us to obtain positive\nproofs of identity, with but meagre success ; nevertheless, tricks of speech,\nmannerisms, &c, were frequently to be observed in the communications,\nboth in automatic and direct writing, which in our opinion went far to prove\nthat the writing really emanated from the person whose signature it bore.\nTo me, who have a practical knowledge of telegraphy, one of the strongest\nproofs in favour of the genuineness of the raps was the obtaining by their\nmeans on the floor and on the table the repetition of Morse signals, so\nperfectly produced that they reflected back my own \"sending.\" Those on\nthe floor came in the dark, whereas those on the table were dealt in heavy\nblows under a strong light. Now, in telegraphy, whatever the instrument\nused, every operator has a decidedly characteristic style of working, just as\n1 In a subsequent letter Mr. Davis says that he was careful to satisfy himself on\nthis point.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 187\nevery writer has his own style of handwriting ; and a good operator at one\nend of a line to which he is accustomed can recognise his fellow operator at\nthe distant station simply by his \"sending.\" It is, indeed, as difficult for\none operator to imitate another's style, as it is for one writer to imitate\nanother's handwriting.\nAdmitting the possibility of spirit intercourse, those united by blood or\nby intimate friendship would from our experience appear to have greater\nfacility in communicating. In September, 1888, Mrs. Z. had the following\nexperience. Her bedroom opened directly into the dining-room, in which a\nlamp was kept burning all night. Her bedroom door, in common with others,\nalways remained open. She had been to sleep, and between two and three\no'clock from some unexplained cause was awakened. While lying still and\nendeavouring to resume her sleep, she suddenly saw her deceased husband\ncome in at the door, and stand at her bedside. He appeared dressed in blue\nserge\u2014a suit he used to wear\u2014and carrying a handkerchief in the left hand\u2014\na frequent habit of his. He was as clearly seen as if in broad daylight. His\nright hand was placed in Mrs. Z.'s ; some words were spoken, to which\nshe replied, and the apparition disappeared. Thereupon she was much\nagitated. The clock struck three immediately after the disappearance. In\nthe morning the words spoken had escaped her memory ; but C. recalled\nthem to her by automatic writing. They were, \" I tried hard to make you see\nme, and I have succeeded at last.\" To which she replied, \"Oh, Dick, dear,\nhow you startled me ! \" which Mrs. Z. recognised to be the exact words.\nThis and the dog were the only apparitions ever seen by her. The children\nalso testified to the great distinctness of the various forms seen by them\nclairvoyantly.\nA very near relation of ours living in England had for some time been in\na precarious state of health. The decay caused by old age and the hardships\nhe had suffered in his country's service might well lead us to suppose that he\nwould not be much longer spared to us. We did not, however, apprehend im\nmediate dissolution ; nevertheless, he was described in direct writing as being\nhalfon the other side, and his almost immediate death was foretold. Character\nistically enough our leading questions\u2014for we were then new to the subject\n\u2014elicited a premature announcement of his decease. Yet, in fact, he did pass\nover in about ten weeks' time after the prediction ; and, although the exact\ndate of his death was not given, his wife, who had gone before him, was absent\nat the time from our sittings, and was said by the other influences to be en\ngaged elsewhere. When Mrs. Z. and I received the news, we communicated\nit to my wife only, and, warned by former experience, refrained from again\nsuggesting anything to guide the mediums, but waited patiently for a spon\ntaneous test. It came. Shortly afterwards\u2014a fortnight before mail news\nconfirmed the telegraphic notice\u2014we obtained an alphabetic message by the\nstriking of a slate against tlie table, the slate being held by C. and Professor\nAlexander. The words were \" F is rising,\" and they were supposed to\nbe given by the hitherto absent influence, who now once more returned to\nour circle. Admitting again the possibility of spirit intercourse, these\nincidents seem to be highly suggestive.\nAn instructive instance of how mediums might be influenced by outside\nintelligence is the following. Much automatic writing over the signature of\n\f188 F. W. H. Myers.\na person not directly connected with us was received. Upon coming to Eng\nland, it was, through a mediumistic relative of this person, declared that she\nhad endeavoured to influence, and communicate with our circle in South\nAmerica, but did not know if she had succeeded. \u2014T. H. Davis.\nI have read the above accounts and certify to their truth.\u2014S. A. Davis.\n1889.\nProfessor Alexander sends us the following corroboration from the \"Mr.\nX.\" of the above narrative :\u2014,\nMr. X., having been requested to write down his recollections and im\npressions of the sittings at which he was present, has complied in the follow\ning statement addressed to me. He desires to remain incognito in the\nprinted accounts, but his real name and address have been given to Mr.\nMyers.\n\"Your account of psychical phenomena obtained in Mr. D.'s circle\nreached me on 17th inst. I have carefully read it through, and do nob\nhesitate for a moment to confirm every statement contained in it respecting\nfacts which were witnessed at times when I was present.\n\"As I took no notes whatever, I must trust to my memory for the brief\naccount of my own observations which I am about to give you.\n\"Raps.\n\" One evening in the month of October, 1888, after we had been sitting,\nMr. D., Mrs. D., C. D., A. D., and I went into the children's bedroom.\nC. D., A. D., and I were seated on the bed (feet on the bed), and Mr. D.\non a chair close to the bed. As to Mrs. D. 's whereabouts, I cannot quite\nremember it. The room was in total darkness. We had not been seated\nmany minutes when we heard raps, which seemed to increase' in strength ;\nand at times such blows were given on the floor as to make one think that\nsomeone was using a mallet.\n\"As far as I recollect, this experiment was tried in consequence of similar\nresults having been obtained on a previous occasion, when I was not present.\nOn the same occasion lights were seen by Mrs. D. and the children. On\nanother occasion, later on in the same year, I was present at a sitting when\nraps were reproduced on the floor, corresponding to silent movements of Mr.\nD. 's finger, the room being in total darkness. I have also heard the Morse\nalphabet tapped out on the table by Mr. D., and the same signals reproduced\nin different parts of the room. Several times I have heard raps on the case\nment of the window, close to which I was sitting, no one else being near\nenough to touch it.\n\"Direct Writing. r\n' 'I have seen direct writing many times ; but on one occasion in particular,\nat the close of our sitting, A. D. held the slate under the table with from\n20 to 25 small pieces of pencil on it. In the space of about half a minute, I\nshould think, she drew the slate out, and we found ' good-night ' written\nmore or less the same number of times as there were pieces of pencil\u2014and\nall in different handwritings. A. D. was holding the slate in one hand, her\nother hand was on the table joined to those of the other sitters.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 189\n\"I regret that I cannot give you a more detailed account of my experience.\nAll that I have stated is well stamped on my memory ; and I have refrained\nfrom making any statement that I am not quite clear about.\n\" Rio de Janeiro. \"X.\"\n\"February 19th, 1890.\nGroup A. Case XL (S. 9.)\nThe following case is of a surprising character, but it comes to us on very\ngood authority. Mr. 0 , the writer of the narrative, a gentleman engaged in\nimportant business (and whose name may be given to inquirers), is in every\nway an excellent witness. His account of the facts, although written in its\npresent form some six years after the occurrences, was compiled from notes\ntaken at the time. Mr. C. mentioned the facts shortly after they occurred to\nthe Rev. Edward White, who communicated them to Professor Barrett, and\nProfessor Barrett then interviewed Mr. C. on the subject. I also know Mr. 0.,\nand have seen Mrs. C. and Mr. H. Mrs. C. gave me verbal confirmation of her\nhusband's account. To Mr. H. the subject is still so painful that he cannot\nbe approached upon it. I may add that this is almost the only case within\nmy knowledge where seances have been followed by any injury beyond some\nlittle temporary fatigue and excitement. Mr. H. is still a strong and robust\nman, and exercises his profession as usual, but his nerves have not recovered\nfrom the shock which these strange phenomena inflicted on them. Mr. C.\nhad lost sight of Miss A. before we obtained his account.\nMr. C.'s Account.\nSome eight years ago I had a few experimental sittings in my own house\nwith a few friends, obtaining the usual results, table turning, lifting, raps,\n&c. This decided me upon trying to thoroughly investigate the matter,\nand I had a number of seances with friends, and also with professional\nmediums. These were held in various places and under a variety of\nconditions, the results being as follow :\u2014\nI was firmly convinced that the results obtained were apart from any\ndirect action of the medium, who had no control whatever over the nature\nof the manifestations, or the electrical or other conditions required to pro\nduce them.\nI was not, however, convinced of the supernatural character of the\nmanifestations, and felt that it was impossible to thoroughly establish my\nconviction as to the action of the medium unless I obtained similar, results\nin my own circle, without the presence of any professional medium, and\nunder conditions rendering imposture impossible. Such an opportunity\noffered six years ago. I was staying at Lowestoft with my wife, a young\nlady, and a gentleman, an old and intimate friend. We decided upon trying\nwhat results we could obtain.\nAll these, especially my wife, were unbelievers, who ridiculed the whole\nthing.\nWe sat in a drawing-room, on the first floor, with the door locked, and\nthe key in my pocket. We turned down the gas, but it was a full moon,\nshining full upon the windows, and the whole room was light enough for us to\n\f190 F. W. H. Myers.\nsee one another, and in fact everything that was around and in the room.\nThe table was an oblong, heavy, walnut one. I will call my friend F. and\nthe young lady A.\nFirst evening.\u2014The usual manifestations took place. Table moved about\nthe room ; a match-box was brought from the other end of the room.\nCommunication was held by raps, I calling out the alphabet, and many\nquestions answered. F. was declared to be a medium, other mediums\ndeclared doubtful. The only message given, except in reply to questions\nput, was, \" C, I'm in love ! \"\nSecond evening. \u2014The above manifestations were repeated, but answers\nfuller and more coherent. Lights were visible floating about the room,\nespecially over the heads of my wife and F. F. 's name was spelt, my wife's\nname was spelt, and she was declared to be a medium. F. complained\nmuch of being touched, his hair pulled, clothes dragged, &c, and during the\nwhole of our seances this was constantly the case. He said he felt \" cold\nhands on him.\" Incidentally I may observe that during all these mani\nfestations and afterwards, except when our circle was forcibly broken, we\nnever ceased to hold hands tightly, not merely lay them on the table, as is\noften the case.\nA. was touched on the face and hands. F. asks for a book to be brought,\nwhich was instantly done, one from another part of the room being thrown\non to the table before him. I ask for further proof. F. 's chair is suddenly\ndragged from under him, his foot laid hold of, and he is thrown down on the\nfloor, still holding my wife's hand, but without the slightest noise or injury.\nOn turning up the gas we find him in a trance, the book balanced in an\nimpossible position (so far as gravitation goes) upon his knee. His watch\nand a ring (which latter was on a finger of the hand my wife still held) were\non a sofa at the other end of the room, a large one ; a small key fastened\nupon the swivel of his watch chain had disappeared. After a few minutes\nhe recovered, I having lifted him on to a sofa, thought he had been asleep,\nfelt quite well, and was unconscious of what had taken place, or that he had\nbeen on the floor. When we sat again a message came, \" I love F.\" On\nasking who, the reply was \" Katie.\" This so annoyed him that we discon\ntinued sitting. Lights were frequently appearing all through the evening,\nand a broad collar of flame was round my wife's neck at one time.\nThird evening. \u2014I placed a paper speaking tube on the table, but \"they\"\nrefused to use it. My wife asks for a book ; a French work was brought to\nher from under a pile of other books in the room. She is a very fine French\nscholar. She asks to have F.'s watch key, lost the night before, returned.\nIt was at once thrown on to the table before her. A. is touched a good deal.\nThe tube is floated about the room, and then thrown down on the table.\nIn consequence of the annoyances, pinches, &c, F. asks to sit out. He goes\ninto a recess in a bay window, within sight of us all, sitting in a wicker\nchair, which creaks loudly at the slightest motion, and smoking. We then\ncontinue. My wife is violently shaken and agitated ; a figure appears, a\nwoman in dark clothes, gliding gently from behind me. She passes A.,\ntakes hold of F.'s chair (left by the table), moves it out of the way, and,\ngliding round the table, approaches my wife, who, on feeling the hands of\nthe figure upon her, screams, and I turn up the gas. We all three saw the\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 191\nfigure distinctly, and can also swear that F. remained in the chair looking\nout of the window. He did not see it ; a rustling noise accompanied its\nprogress.\nF. rejoined the circle. By my request he asked for flowers for the\nladies. Immediately two bunches of cut hot-house flowers, double stocks,\n&c. (it being October), were placed in front of them.\nF. sat with his feet round the legs of his chair to prevent its being drawn\naway, and wore Wellington boots. He called out, \" They are taking my coat\noff,\" was thrown down, my wife holding his hand tightly. His coat was off,\nhis boots were on a sofa 10 yards away, his handkerchief tied in a knot, and\nin another place.\nWe sit again and I ask for something from home, but am refused. F.\nasks for something from home, becomes violently agitated, is thrown into a\ntrance, and a photograph of a young lady is on the table in front of him.\nMy wife takes it up, and on his recovery, which took some 15 minutes or so,\nshows it him. He puts it into his pocket, bursts into tears, and says, \" I\nwould not have had that happen for anything.\"\nThe photo was the only copy existing of a portrait of a young lady he was\nonce engaged to. It was in an album in a drawer with two locks over it in\nhis house at Bayswater. On our return to town it had disappeared, and his\nwife, being quite ignorant of our having had seances, told us that at that\nvery hour a fearful crash occurred in his bedroom, and brought everyone in\nthe house up to inquire the cause.\nMy wife asked him to show her the photo, when, to his dismay, it had\ndisappeared from his pocket. A number of other minor manifestations\noccurred of which I took no notice, and all through the seances, whenever\nanything happened, F. became violently agitated. We decided not to sit\nagain, but he was so upset the next day at losing the photo, that my wife\nsuggested sitting once more to try and recover it.\nFourth evening.\u2014My head was violently struck as if by a sofa pillow\nthrown or some soft substance. An object passed over our hands and across\nthe table, feeling soft like feathers. F. asks for fruit and flowers ; more\nflowers are brought and apples, the only fruit of the season, which we had\nnot in the house. A. asks for something of hers. Her pocket-book is\nbrought from another table.\nMy wife asks for something. F. is thrown down instantly, und on the\ntable is the photo, lost the night before.\nInstead of recovering quickly, F. has alternate fits of unconsciousness\nand raving delirium, which last for five hours. He is then sensible, but very\nweak. The next day he begged my wife to destroy the photo, which they\nburned in our presence. F. had a mild attack of brain fever.\nOn our return my house was subject to noises, knockings, &c, constantly,\nand is still at times. My wife has seen figures, and the tricks constantly\nplayed upon her were most annoying.\nOften I have seen an article of jewellery disappear as soon as she has\nplaced it upon the table, and be found afterwards in most unaccountable\nplaces. We were touched, sprinkled with water in the night, and it was\nonly when we gave up the entire subject that the annoyance ceased. Even\n\f192 F. W. H. Myers.\nLately a singular noise has followed me to Bournemouth, Hastings, and to a\nfriend's house at Camden Town. F. 's nervous system is shattered.\nDuring these seances there was no possibility of imposture, and the\npeople concerned were all thoroughly reliable and incapable of it. I have\nomitted a great deal of the detail of our seances, giving you merely the\nmain facts.\nNovember 27th, 1876.\nDecember 2nd, 1876.\nIn a subsequent letter Mr. C. wrote to Professor Barrett :\u2014\nF. is thoroughly reliable, a singularly sensitive man, but straightforward,\nhonest, moral, and quite incapable of trickery or deceit. A. is a timid young\ngirl. I would answer for both of them. We were staying in apartments.\nThe only other people in the house were A.'s father and mother in\nthe dining-rooms, old friends, and they were quite ignorant of what took\nplace above. I myself locked the door, pocketing the key, on each\noccasion.\nNot the least remarkable thing is the extraordinary influence exerted over\nF. by both my wife and myself, especially the former. When his attacks\ncome on he cannot sleep at night, and the only cure for them is sleep. If\nhe lies down on a sofa, it is sufficient for my wife to sit beside him to\nsend him to sleep at once.\nProbably mesmerism might do him good. It would not do for you to see\nhim, however. For five years the subject of Spiritualism has not been men\ntioned to him ; any casual allusion to it by a stranger even causes him\nviolent agitation, and brings on these attacks.\nMy wife also has often told me on going home, \"You were talking upon\nthe forbidden subject at such an hour to-day,\" which was true, although she\ncould have no means of knowing except by her nervous sensations.\nIn a letter in Light, January 20th, 1883, Mr. C. again mentions some of\nthese facts. And, finally, in a letter to myself he answers some further\nquestions.\nApril 2bth, 1889.\nRegarding your various questions, I will take them seriatim,.\n1. F. was in splendid health previous to our seances ; he had spent about\na fortnight with us, he and I riding together daily, and had not the least\nsymptom of approaching illness. He was perfectly conscious of all his\nactions at the time, and during our seances conversed in the usual way. He\nexpressed surprise at the results, but was calm, collected, rather jocular\nduring the first two evenings, and showed no sign of brain excitement,\nexcept by his trances and bewilderment for a minute or two after his sudden\nrecovery from them. The theory of his having produced the phenomena,\nexcept possibly as an unconscious instrument, is in my opinion quite\nuntenable. 1 had then known him intimately for 10 years, and his habits,\nhis very high character, honourable and chivalric to a degree, preclude\npossibility of trickery, nor had he any experience which could qualify him\nfor such performance.\n2. Conditions as to light. Our gas was turned low, but there was\nsufficient light for us to see distinctly one another and every object in the\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 193\nroom. In addition it was full moon, and her light alone streaming in through\ntwo windows would have been enough. We held hands firmly throughout\nthe seances.\n3. Our seance when the photo came took place about 10 to 11 p.m. I\nnever left Mr. F. until 3 a.m. By afternoon delivery next day came\nhis wife's letter describing the crash, which she said was heard next door.\nShe could not be questioned about it, as she knew nothing about our seances,\nand on our return to London the subject was tabooed by order of the\ndoctor, the slightest allusion to it exciting F . fearfully.\n4. I never heard of any further phenomena occurring to Mrs. F.\n5. On our return home my wife and I were annoyed constantly in various\nways. Raps and noises were incessant. Doors thrown open again and\nagain when carefully closed, and in some instances locked. Our servants\nalso complained of the same annoyances ; sounds as of a drum or a horn\nclose to us in the night. On one occasion, in bed with door locked, we were\nsprinkled with water from my bath. Various small articles belonging to my\nwife disappeared, and were found afterwards in different places, in one\ninstance in a drawer locked previously. We were touched on the arm by\ninvisible hands. When we avoided all reference to the subject, these annoy\nances gradually ceased.\n6. The only clue to the personality of the figure is, that previously when\nasked with whom we were communicating the reply was \"Katie.\" Last year\nwhen I asked the same question in Adelaide, the answer was \" Kate Hope.\"\nMy experiences with professional mediums were much of the same character\nthroughout, only I found them playing tricks, though many results were\nundoubtedly beyond their control.\nOn all occasions, both at seances and privately, immediately before and\nduring any manifestation, we all felt a sudden chill, like either a wave of\nintensely oold air passing, or a rapid decrease of temperature. Also a current\nof electricity appeared to pass through our circle, at times so powerful as to\nmake our arms quiver, as if we were holding the handles of a mild battery.\nIt will be observed that Mr. C. believes Mr. H. to have been in normal\nhealth until upset by the seances. It is, however, possible that some\ncerebral trouble may have been already impending, of which Mr. C. saw no\nindication,\u2014and that Mr. H. may have been in an abnormal state during the\nseances, and have performed acts of which he was not fully conscious. This\nview is pro tanto supported by the very fact of the illness, for which the\nseances seem to supply no adequate cause. On the other hand, it would not\nbe easy to explain on this hypothesis all the phenomena which Mr. C;\nrecords.\nGroup A. Case XII. (S. 10.)\nThe communication here translated was sent by Dr. X. C. Dariex to\nProfessor Richet, who has discussed the phenomena in conversation with\nDr. Dariex, and has forwarded the case to us as coming from trustworthy\nobservers.\nDr. Dariex has allowed me to see the original of the Report and signatures.\n0\n\f194 F. W. H. Myers.\nDr. Dariex's Account.\nOn Friday, the 30th of November, having some friends with me, one of\nwhom was a medical man, we occupied ourselves, for a couple of hours after\ndinner, with some experiments in table-tilting in my study. It was the first\ntime that seances of this nature had taken place in my rooms. The follow\ning morning I was not a little surprised when my servant, an honest Bre-\ntonne, maintained that between half-past three and four o'clock a.m. she had\ndistinctly heard sounds of alternating muffled footsteps and little raps on the\nfurniture, proceeding from my study, which was next the room in which she\nslept. I imagined that she had localised in my study sounds which had\ntaken place above, in a flat identical with my own, and only occupied at\nnight by M.D., a lawyer, and his wife. Owing to the persistence with which\nmy servant affirmed that the noises proceeded from my study and from no\nwhere else, I inquired the same day of M.D. whether during the night, after\nthree o'clock, anyone had been walking about and knocking the furniture in\nhis study, his drawing-room, or his dining-room. He replied that he and\nMadame D. had retired about midnight, and that nobody could have been\nwalking or knocking in his rooms at that time.\nIn spite of having frequently read accounts of similar occurrences, I did\nnot at once decide that the house was haunted (as did my servant, a native\nof the land of legends) ; but supposed this to be a case of hallucination,\nalthough the hypothesis did not satisfy me. In fact, why should this girl, who\nhad previously had no hallucinations, experience them just on this night\nwhen we had been making experiments in table-tilting\u2014a science of which\nshe had never heard, and which could not have influenced her imagination,\nas she did not even know of its existence ? Moreover, when I asked her\nwhether the sound of the carriages interfered with what she believed she\nheard, she replied in the affirmative. This does not appear to me to support\nthe hypothesis of hallucination, which would not have been temporarily\ndestroyed by the rumbling of the carriages passing from time to time.\nIt points rather to the existence of a real noise, outside the person who\nperceived it.\nThe phenomena were again produced on three occasions : on the 14th and\n21st of December, and on the 4th of January,\u2014always on a Friday, and\nalways between half-past three and four o'clock in the morning, and lasting\nfor about half an hour.\nThe table, when consulted, invariably said that the sounds were produced\nby Madame D., who had been dead several months. In spite of my doubts\nas to the existence of spirits, and consequently as to the reality of their com\nmunications, I asked Madame D. , one evening when her spirit was said to be\npresent, to produce something more tangible than the sounds which only the\nservant could hear, my room being too far removed from where they took\nplace. I begged her to turn over a chair. For some time I had had a great\ndesire to witness this phenomenon, and for eight or ten days had every\nevening placed a chair in my study, so inclined that the slightest effort would\nmake it fall. It is important to notice this desire : it shows that, contrary\nto my wish, the act that I had asked for was not yet produced. Madame D.\npromised to accede to my request and approved my plan of arranging a chair\nin such a way as to facilitate its overthrow. It was on a Friday, the 11th of\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 195\nJanuary, 1889, that I made my request. As the sounds had hitherto always\ntaken place during the night of Friday, I asked Madame D. whether she\ncould satisfy my curiosity that same night. She replied that she could. The\nfollowing morning all the chairs were upright, as I had placed them the\nevening before, including the one whose stability I had so greatly decreased.\nFrom this I concluded, a little hastily, that nothing would happen, and that\nthe communication of the preceding evening was only the reflection of my own\nthought. I also made up my mind not to ask my table anything more. But\nto satisfy my conscience, that evening I again placed a chair in the manner I\nwas accustomed to do. What was my surprise the following morning, to find\nthe chair upon which I had been sitting drawing till 11 o'clock at night, thrown\nover on its left side in front of my bookshelves ! That which I had prepared\nby leaning one of its bars against the key of the drawers of my writing-table,\nwas just as I had left it. That same night, between half-past two and three\no'clock, besides the falling of the chair, which had greatly alarmed her, my\nservant had heard little raps on the furniture, raps which this time were not\nalternated with muffled foptsteps. This took place in the night between\nSaturday the 12th and Sunday the 13th of January. Four days later, during\nthe night of the 16th, the prepared chair in its turn was overthrown. On\nthis occasion the servant heard nothing. During the night of Saturday, the\n19th of January, no chair was thrown down, but between half-past two and\nthree my servant heard the usual raps alternating with muffled footsteps.\nOn the 21st of January, on coming home a little before midnight, I\nexperienced some trouble in opening the door of my room, which I had care\nfully locked before going out : a chair overturned against the door proved to\nbe the obstacle. On the 23rd of January, before going out at eight o'clock,\nI locked my study, and sealed all the entrances : on returning at ten\nminutes past twelve, I found the seals in perfect condition, and in this room,\nwhich nobody could have entered, a chair had fallen on its back. ' The\nservant had not heard the noise of the fall ; she was asleep when it was\nproduced ; but the same night, a little after three o'clock, she heard a noise\nof another sort. Three hard strokes had been violently given on the panel\nof the door leading to the drawing-room : the first, being isolated and the\nleast violent, had not attracted her attention ; she had taken it for an\nordinary sound, and had not attempted to discover its cause ; the two others,\nmore violent and in succession, had frightened her. These noises, it\nappeared, resembled those which I was able to make the next day, by\nviolently rapping on the panel of the door, with the lower end of my fingers\nand my fist well closed. Finally, on the 24th, at a quarter to one, in spite of\nmy room being locked and sealed as on the previous night, I found not only\none but two chairs overthrown. I could no longer doubt the reality of the\nfact ; it was evident to me that chairs were displaced in my room during the\nnight, by a mysterious force. I say mysterious, because the series of experi\nments which I had been able to make with the assistance of two mediums of\nmy acquaintance, had produced contradictory results, and had not satisfied\nme to the point of admitting that it was really Madame D. who thus pro\nduced these strange phenomena as she had promised me. I decided to verify\nthis overthrowing of chairs by others than myself, who should take all the\nprecautions they desired to satisfy themselves ; but before inviting them,\n0 2\n\f196 F. W. H. Myers.\nalthough I was not convinced of the existence of spirits, I wished to ask\nMadame D. whether she could again produce the phenomena which I wished\nto have investigated. In a communication which took place on the 25th of\nJanuary, she assured me that the experiments would succeed, and in reply to\nmy question, added, that without being certain, she hoped to produce the\nphenomena after a delay of three days. The investigations commenced on\nthe 26th of January, and succeeded completely, as is shown in the report,\nand it was on the third day, to their great astonishment, that the investi\ngators found two chairs overturned. Indeed they had been confident that\non account of the precautions taken (precautions which excluded the\nhypothesis of fraud) nothing would take place, and that if I had not been\nhallucinated, I had been duped. On the 4th of February, in the morning,\ntwo chairs were again found overturned, and those who had lent me\ntheir assistance declared themselves sufficiently convinced of the reality of\nthe fact. I wished to push my investigations still farther, and anxious to hear\nor even to see something, I slept for three weeks in the room where all this\nhad taken place. I heard nothing, I saw nothing ; everything had suddenly\nceased, to the great disappointment of myself, and the great satisfaction of\nmy servant, who was glad no longer to hear the noises which so frightened\nher.\nReport op the Occurrences at Dr. Dariex's\nFrom the 26th of January to the 4th of February, 1889.\nThe undersigned certify to the accuracy of the facts which follow :\u2014\nDr. Barbillion, M.D. of Paris, formerly medical officer in the hospitals,\n16, Quai d'Orleans, Paris.\nBesombes, Paul, surveyor of bridges and highways, 7, Rue Boutarel,\nParis.\nDr. Meneault, Johan, M.D. of Paris, formerly medical officer at the\nMarine Hospital, Berck-sur-Mer, 51, Rue Monge.\nMorin, Louis, apothecary of the first class, 9, Rue du Pont-Louis-\nPhilippe.\nDr. Dariex, 6, Rue du Bellay, Paris, having believed himself able to\nstate that strange phenomena occurred in his study during the night, begged\nthe persons mentioned above to verify the observations he had already made,\nas to the existence of such phenomena. The question, according to Dr.\nDariex, concerned the turning-over of certain chairs in his study, which had\ntaken place on several occasions, when precautions had been taken to exclude\ntrickery. It appeared impossible that any living being should have been able\nto enter the room, the doors and windows having been carefully closed and\nsealed. For 10 days, from the 26th of January to the 4th of February, the\nundersigned had met regularly at Dr. Dariex's, in the evening at eight o'clock,\nand in the morning at half-past eight ; sometimes all were present, sometimes\none or more failed. Dr. Barbillion has not missed a single meeting, and has\nbeen able to be present at the whole series. Dr. Dariex's study is on the\nfirst floor of No. 6, Rue du Bellay, at the corner of that steet and of the Rue\nSt. Louis-en-l'Isle. It is lighted by two windows which look on to the street,\nand communicates with the other rooms of the flat by two doors : one opening\ninwards to the drawing-room, the other communicating with the dining-room\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 197\nand opening inwards to the study. The accompanying plan explains the\narrangement. The furniture consists of a bookcase, a writing-table, an\nordinary table, an armchair, and three other chairs. There is no cupboard in\nthe room. After having carefully examined the windows and doors, as well\nas the different pieces of furniture, the walls and the floor, the undersigned\nwere of opinion that nothing could bring about the overthrow or displacement\nof the furniture or other objects, by means of mechanism, strings, &c, or by\nany other means ; that it was equally impossible for anyone to conceal him\nself in the room, or to get in after the closing and sealing of windows and\ndoors. Under these circumstances, the following precautions were scrupulously\ntaken every evening. The window shutters were closed ; the windows shut\nand seals placed on the bars near the latch. The door of communication\nwith the drawing-room locked on the study side. The key was kept in the\nlock by means of a ribbon sealed at both ends ; seals were placed on the\ndoor, and a band was fixed by one end to the door itself and by the other to\nthe adjoining wall. During the whole time of our investigations, this door\nremained firmly closed. The only remaining opening was the door between\nthe study and the dining-room. The chairs in the study then being placed\naccording to an arranged plan, but not always exactly in the same place, we\nleft the room, Dr. Dariex the first, and each one giving a last look from the\ndining-room to make sure that the chairs were upright and in position ; then\nDr. Barbillion locked the door, and took the key. Seals were placed, and a\nband fastened to the keyhole ; seven or eight places were impressed with M.\nMorin's seal, who kept it, and carried it away with him. The form and\nposition of the seals were carefully noted. These precautions having been\nregularly and rigorously taken every evening at eight o'clock, we met again\nthe next morning at half-past eight to remove the seals. This was always\npreceded by a minute examination of both them and the lock.\nDuring the 10 days of investigation, this is what has been verified.\n1. Night of Saturday, 26th Jan. ...

That no one could have remained in the room after we had left it.\n2. That no one could have entered it during the night.\nAnd we are led to conclude :\u2014\nThat during the night, in the interval of 10 days, in the centre of a com\npletely closed room, into which no one could have entered, chairs were over\nturned contrary to our expectation and prevision. That this manifestation of\nan apparently mysterious force, being produced outside ordinary conditions,\ndoes not seem referable to an ordinary explanation ; and without wishing\nto prejudicate the intimate nature of this force, or to draw positive con\nclusions, we are inclined to consider the phenomena to be of a psychical\norder, analogous to those which have been described and verified by a certain\nnumber of investigators.\nWith this well-observed and well-attested case I must close the first\ninstalment of this Report. Some further narratives, and some comments\non the evidence in general, are reserved for a subsequent paper. In the\nmeantime it is earnestly to be hoped that the publication of these cases\nmay lead to fresh experiment. It must always be remembered that\nthe evidence thus far obtained on all these topics is the outcome of\nscattered, desultory experiments, often undertaken with no scientific\npurpose, and recorded with insufficient care. What may be achieved\nwhen the systematic attention of careful observers is directed to these\nquestions, it is at present impossible to say.\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 199\nII.\nEXPERIMENTS IN CLAIRVOYANCE.\nBy Dr. Alfred Backman, of Kalmar, Sweden.\nThe experiments to be recorded below do not claim to be con\nsidered strictly scientific, but I describe them simply as I have made\nthem, in the hope that others may be incited to carry out similar\nattempts in a more systematic and scientific manner than my practical\noccupations have given me time for. It is at the request of some\nprominent persons in this and other countries that I publish my\nobservations on the reality and nature of clairvoyance, and I am\nfurther induced to do so by the publication of similar experiments\nmade by others.\nBefore relating specific instances of clairvoyance I should like to\nlay before the reader some general observations that I have made.\nIn the first place, I have found that, unless I have been un\nusually fortunate in meeting with clairvoyants, they are not so rare\nas is generally supposed. On the contrary, a great number of persons\ncapable of being hypnotised have clairvoyant faculties. Hitherto I\nhave experimented only with Swedes, but I believe there is as little\ndifference in this respect between different nations as between different\nsexes, ages, and constitutions. My youngest clairvoyant subject was a\ngirl of 14 years old, small and immature, my oldest a man of 66 years of\nage. The characters of my subjects have also varied very much, and so\nhas the depth of the hypnotic state in which the phenomena occurred.\nThis latter fact led me to the discovery that it was not only unnecessary\nfor them to reach the deeper stages, but even unnecessary that they\nshould be hypnotised at all. Sometimes, therefore, I have not hypno\ntised my subjects, and I have almost always allowed them to retain the\nmemory of the sleep and of everything that has taken place in it ; and,\ncontrary to the assertion of Du Prel and others, the subject has never\nexperienced any inconvenience from this. The result of it has been\nthat, on waking, he has remembered a number of circumstances per\nceived during the clairvoyant state, but not mentioned then. Indeed,\nit seems to me natural that the subject, on awaking and recovering the\ncomplete use of his intellect, should be better able to co-ordinate the\nimpressions received during sleep, and so produce a more satisfactory\nresult.\nI have never refused to admit that some descriptions given by the\n\f200 Dr. Alfred Backmun.\nsomnambulist, especially such as are familiar to any person present,\ncould be reasonably put down to thought-transference ; but though I\nrecognise to the full the possible extension and great importance of\nthis faculty, still for many reasons I hold that apparent clairvoyance\nshould very seldom be explained in this manner, even when the things\nstated by the somnambulist are known to one or more of the persons\npresent. But at the very least such experiments afford strong evidence\nof the reality of thought-transference, and that is undoubtedly an\nimportant thing.\nMy experiments have been carried out in various ways. I have\ngenerally hypnotised my subjects by the Nancy method, and after they\nhad been asleep for some minutes I would order them to go to such\nand such a place and find such and such a person, after which I would\nask them questions. On awaking, the subjects would again be asked\nto describe their experiences during the sleep. I sometimes suggested\na \" guide \" to the subject, who then imagined himself to be getting\ninformation from the \" guide.\"1 Twice (without having at that time\nheard of such a thing being done elsewhere) I made the subject see\nthings quite unknown both to her and to me in a crystal (crystal-\ngazing), when she was in an apparently normal condition. Finally, I\nsometimes left the subject entirely uninfluenced, putting questions\nwithout any preliminary process whatever.\nMost of my attempts having been made merely to amuse friends\nand persons who were interested, notes were not generally taken nor\ncorroborative evidence obtained. The presence of witnesses, some of\nwhom have allowed their names to be published, is a guarantee for the\ntruthfulness of the accounts. It will also be seen by the character of\nthe experiments that there could never have been any question of\nfraud on the part of the subjects or of any other person, and that it\ncould not have profited anyone in any case whatever. Further, the\nexperiments have been made with different subjects and different\noperators, and sometimes in my own absence.\nThe first time I ever tried an experiment to test the reality of\nclairvoyance was with a little girl of 14 years old, Anna Samuelsson,\nthe daughter of a workman. I had treated her for a grave organic\ndisease of the heart (insufficiency of the mitral valves) with a most happy\n1 To illustrate his use of the word \"Guide,\" Dr. Backman writes: 'Tor instance,\nin the case of the murder of December 22nd, ]888 (see p. 218, below), I asked Alma\nto call up Jack the Ripper's last victim (whom she named Kate), and ask her when\nhe would commit his next crime. She imagined that she saw a very pretty young\nwoman in a ball-dress, who told her that it would be on the 22nd of next December,\n&c. Aimj did not speak out loud, and the persons present observed nothing unusual.\nI have thus made her ask for information from persons either dead or living, known or\nunknown.\"\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 201\nresult, which still continues after two and a-half years. I had made\nseveral experiments in thought-transference with her, in which she\ntold several times running what numbers, words, &c, a person present\nhad written on a folded paper, which neither she nor I saw. When\nawake she also saw things that were asked me in writing, I, of course,\nnot helping her either by word or gesture.\nOnce, when she and some other patients were hypnotised at the\ncamp of the regiment of Kalmar, about 13 miles from the town of\nKalmar where I live, I asked her to \" go to Kalmar.\" On my asking\nif she were there, she answered \"yes\"; and little by little she described\nhow she saw a great town, where there were two big buildings, one\nhaving several steeples (towers) [the church and the castle] ; the\nhouse where I lived was a yellow house two stories high, and I lived\non the first floor. She then entered the apartments, passed the lobby\nand one room, and then came to another room where she admired \" so\nmany beautiful pictures, especially one which was so large.\" She then\nentered a third room and was greatly astonished at seeing things hanging\non the walls; she had never seen any such things hanging on walls; they\nwere probably made of wood. [A great quantity of old china hangs\non the walls.] In this room she saw a lady, whom I recognised from\nher description as my wife, and a little boy ; but there was something\nstrange about him, she saw him double. [A pair of twins, both boys,\nextremely like each other.] So far I was not surprised, as, in order to\ngive this information, she had only to employ her faculty for thought-\nreading, but after this my thoughts and her statements began to differ.\nThere was an old lady in my house, and expecting that the girl might\n\" see \" her also, I asked if she did not see another lady, to which she\nanswered that she did see another, a young girl, whom she described so\nexactly that I recognised Miss H. W. After that she told me that my\nwife dressed and went out, entered a shop and bought something.\nThe experiment ended here.\nI now made haste to write to my wife and ask if Miss H. W. had\nbeen in our house that day (in June, 1888), and if, after her call, my\nwife had gone to a shop and bought something. Some officers of the\nregiment who knew of the case were with me anxiously awaiting the\nanswer, which came by return of post and was imparted to them.1 It\nexpressed my wife's great surprise (as I had not mentioned the means\nby which I had learnt the facts) and said it certainly was true that\nshe had spoken to Miss H. W. on that day and hour, and had after\nwards gone to a shop in the same street to buy something, but Miss\nH. W. had not been at our house but at Ryssby, 20 kilometres from\nKalmar, and had been talking to my wife through a telephone.\n1 This letter cannot now be found.\n\fDr Alfred Backman.\nI have already published in the German magazine Sphinx (August,\n1889) an account of another trial with the same subject. On that\noccasion, notes were taken, which are as follows :\u2014,\nNotes of Some Psychological Experiments.\nThese experiments were made on June 20th, 1888, at 11 a.m., with a\ngirl named Anna Samuelsson, aged 14, from Hultsfred Hals, as subject, the\noperator being Dr. Backman, in the presence of Messrs. O. Ahlgren, captain\nin the Reserve of the Royal Regiment of Kalmar, Lieutenant E. Hageus,\nSub-Lieutenant A. Meyersson, and the Quarter-master, C. Ericsson, all\nbelonging to the said regiment. The experiments were made at Dr. Back-\nman's room at the State Hospital at Hultsfred.\nThe undersigned Ericsson, having heard the marvellous results of hypno\ntism talked of, happened to meet Dr. Backman in the camp, and asked his\npermission to be present at the hypnotising of some person. This request\nwas quite unexpected by Dr. Backman, but, nevertheless, he granted it\ninstantly, on which he and both of us (Ericsson and Meyersson) went to the\nhospital. On the way they were joined by me, Hageus, without any pre\nvious agreement, and I, Ahlgren, came in after the seance had begun.\nA woman named L. having been hypnotised and several experiments in\nthought-transference, &c, having been made with her, she was asked to tell\nthe girl Anna to come up, but Dr. Backman had hardly uttered the order,\nwhen Anna entered of her own accord. She took her place on a chair\nopposite to Dr. Backman, and he told her to shut her eyes, but not to\ngo to sleep. The quarter-master Ericsson was asked what experiments he\nwould like to have made, Dr. Backman remarking that the girl could do as\nwell when awake as when hypnotised. As Ericsson did not suggest anything,\nDr. Backman told Anna to enter (as he expressed it) Ericsson's pocket and\npurse and say how many coins there were in it. She said that there were\nfive, which was discovered, on inspection, to be quite true, though neither\nDr. Backman nor even I, Ericsson, knew what the number was. After\nsome other experiments and some conversation, the following dialogue took\nplace, in about these words :\u2014Dr. B. : \"Anna, now I wish you to go to\nthe quarter-master's, to the entry ; are you there now ? \" Anna: \"Yes.\"\nDr. B. : \" Now enter the room to the right of the entry ; are you there ? \"\nAnna: \"Yes.\" Dr. B. : \"Is there anyone in the room?\" Anna:\n\"Yes.\" Dr. B. : \" Man or woman ? \" Anna: \"It is a man.\" Dr. B. :\n\"Young or old?\" Anna: \"Old.\" Dr. B. : \"Who is it?\" Anna:\n\" The under-quarter-master.\" Dr. B. (Doubtingly) : \" What is he doing in\nthe quarter-master's room?\" Anna : \" He is writing.\" Dr. B. : \"Whatishe\nwriting?\" Anna: \"I cannot see.\" Dr. B. : \"You must look at it care\nfully ; now, what is it?\" Anna: \"He is writing figures.\" Dr. B. (In\nallusion to the arms hanging up in Ericsson's house) : \"Is there anything\nhanging on the wall, near the door?\" Anna: \"Yes.\" Dr. B. : \"What is\nit?\" Anna: \"It is clothes.\" Dr. B. (With a doubting smile): \"Is\nthere anything leaning against the wall?\" Anna: \"Yes.\" Dr. B. :\n\"What is it?\" Anna: \"I cannot tell.\" Dr. B. : \"Is it made of wood\nor metal?\" Anna: \"Of wood.\" Dr. B. : \"What is it then?\" Anna:\n\"A large stick.\" Dr. B.: \"Is the under-quarter-master still there?\" Anna:\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 203\n\"Yes.\" Dr. B. : \" What is he doing now ? \" Anna: \"He is going out.\"\nDr. B. : \"Where is he going?\" Anna: \"Towards the plain.\" Dr. B. :\n\" In this direction or in the direction of the barracks?\" Anna: \"Of the\nbarracks.\" Dr. B. : \" Is anyone with him ? \" Anna: \"Yes, one person.\"\nAfter this, we, Ahlgren and Ericsson, went directly to the quarter-master's\nhouse, and entering the apartment of the under-quarter-master (which was on\nthe left in the same entry) we found him at home. On being asked what he\nhad been doing, if he had been writing, he replied that he had, and that he\nhad been writing figures. Coats were hanging on the wall to the left of the\ndoor, and leaning against the samewall in the cornerwas a stick about two yards\nlong, which, according to the under-quarter-master, had been put there without\nany particular reason. The under-quarter-master afterwards told me, Ericsson,\nthat, at the time and on the occasion in question, two corporals had come to\nhim and there had been some talk of his accompanying them to the store\nhouse, near the barracks, in order to give them some things. He had at\nfirst intended to accompany them, but afterwards gave it up, on which the\ntwo corporals left.\nThat the above account is true, that any supposition of fraud or collusion\nis entirely without foundation, and that everything happened exactly as\nrelated briefly above, we, the undersigned, testify, each one for the part of\nit in which he was concerned, and all on our honour and conscience.\n(C. E. Ericsson.\nOscar Ahlgren.\nE. Hageus.\nA. Meyersson.\nHultsfred.\nOne of the officers had painted two pictures, which were to be dis\nposed of to his fellow officers by means of a lottery, in the summer of\n1888. I think the number of lots was 75. When the list was signed\nin full, I asked Anna which would be the winning numbers. She\nanswered that Nos. 4 and 9 would win, and I told the officers that\none of the pictures would be won on 4 or 8, and the other on 9 or 18 ;\nthis for the reason that I believe I have observed that just as the\nclairvoyants mistake left and right, so they very often tell only the\nhalf of numbers (perhaps from an involuntary mental suggestion of\nthe experimenter's). This happened a whole week before the drawing\nof the lots. I was unable to be present, but what happened was that\nCaptain F. B. first drew No. 4. For the next number, two tickets\nrolled up together were drawn ; he decided to take one of them, but\njust as he was going to take it with the fingers of his left hand it\ndropped on the floor. The one, left was then opened instead and was\nfound to be No. 18.\nIn the winter of 1889-90, the following event happened, which I\nlearnt both from the newspapers and from Anna, who gave the same\n\f204 Dr. Alfred Bookman.\naccount. In the neighbourhood where she lives, a young man had\ndisappeared, and it was supposed that he had fallen under the ice in a\nrather large lake that was near. It was dragged thoroughly to find\nthe body, but without success, and at last a trial was made with Anna,\nwho was hypnotised for that purpose by a physician living near the\nplace. While hypnotised, she described a place on the lake where\nshe said the body must be looked for\u2014it lay at a certain number of\nfeet from the shore and a certain number of feet to tlie left. The place\ndescribed was dragged and nothing was found. But the idea arose,\nsome days later, that the clairvoyant this time, as often before, had\nmistaken the right for the left. The lake was now dragged at the\nplace indicated, but to the right, and the body was found.\nThe subject whom I consider my best clairvoyant is named Alma\nRadberg. She is a maid-servant, and is now aged about 26. As a child\nand young girl she was sickly and delicate, but now, after a course of\nhypnotic treatment, she is healthy, strong, and vigorous. She is a\nvery pious and good girl, of some intelligence, and by no means a\nhysterical person. She has kindly allowed me and some others to\nmake innumerable experiments on her, and she is extremely susceptible\nto suggestion, both awake and hypnotised. All kinds of experiments,\nsuch as stigmatisation, &c, have been made on her successfully, both\nin the waking and the hypnotic state. I may relate in passing one\ninstance that seems to me remarkable. In the middle of an experi\nment, I put a drop of water on her arm, suggesting to her that it was\na drop of burning sealing-wax, and that it would produce a blister,\nwhich would, however, be healed after the third day. During the\nprogress of the experiment, I accidentally touched the water, making\nit spread on her skin, whereupon I hastened to wipe it away. The\nblister, which appeared the next day, extended as far as the water\nhad run, just as if it had been a corroding acid, and the wound healed\non the night of the third day.\nThe object of most of the experiments made with Alma has been\nto describe to those present the apartments of a given person, &c. ; and\nthe occasions on which she has described the situation of the rooms,\nfurniture, pictures, ifec, quite correctly are so numerous that I can\n,only give a few instances, not being able to recount all.\nIn October, 1888, Captain O. and his wife, who were in Kalmar, at\nthe house of Alma's master, Baron von Rosen, the Captain of the Pilotage,\nasked permission to be present at an experiment of this kind. This was\ngranted, and Alma was hypnotised and then told to go to Stockholm, to\nthe place where Captain O.'s mother-in-law lived, to enter her apart\nment and say what she could see. She then described\u2014quite correctly,\n.as was afterwards found\u2014the rooms and some remarkable objects in\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 205\nthem, which were unknown to all present, except to Captain and\nMadame O. Among other things, she described minutely an antique\ncupboard with conspicuous carving on the doors, and metal shining under\nit [there was really a mirror under the carving] ; also a bust in a\nwindow, a group of flowers near a door, portraits, &c, everything with\nminuteness and perfect accuracy. On being asked what Captain O.'a\nmother-in-law was doing, she said that she was sitting in one of the\nrooms, talking to a young girl, who, however, was not either her\ndaughter or her grandchild, as we all supposed, but someone else.\n[We heard some days later that the lady had really been sitting then\nin the room described and talking to her maid-servant.] At Captain\nO.'s wish, Alma was asked whether his mother-in-law had received any\nletter that day. \" Yes, she had ; the letter contained a key and spoke\nabout clothes.\" Captain O. then told us that he had really sent a\ntrunk containing clothes to his daughter, who was living at his mother-\nin-law's, and that he had written to his mother-in-law about the trunk,\nenclosing the key in the letter. On awaking, the clairvoyant gave\nCaptain O. a great many details about the apartment which she had\nnot mentioned before, and which were in the main correct.\nOn another occasion she was hypnotised by my honoured friend\nBaron von Rosen, and the following is his account of what took\nplace :\u2014\nOne day in September, 1888, in the afternoon, Alma Radberg was\nhypnotised by me on my boat Kalmar, at Krakelund, on the east coast\nof Sweden, where we lay at anchor for the night. There were present the\nDirector-General of Pilotage, Ankarcrona (who has kindly allowed his name\nto be published), Captain Smith, commanding the Pilotage at Norrkoping,\nmy wife and I. The clairvoyant was ordered to find the Director-General's,\nhouse at Stockholm and describe his apartment, where neither she, my wife,\nnor I had ever been. She then described the lobby,\u2014very dark, oblong, a\ntable near a wall, and a carpet on the floor; the drawing room,\u2014a very large\nroom, with the tables, sofas, and chairs as they actually were, plenty of\nornaments (bibelots) everywhere, in a corner a number of plants, of which\nshe remarked that some were artificial, a magnificent chandelier, and on one\nwall there was something strange, which she found it difficult to describe, it\nwas like shelves from the floor to the ceiling, covered with plush, and on\nthese shelves were standing many pieces of plate, on which \"something was\nwritten\" [testimonials with inscriptions]. She also described correctly a large\npicture of a landscape, and a large portrait of King Oscar, which was placed\non an easel, draped with a red cloth. The dining-room was dark, with a\nhigh dado and a dark fireplace ; there were antique things standing on the\ndado ; near one door something very peculiar, made of wood, and pointed\nat the upper end [this, which she could not name, is a pair of carved snow-\nshoes, placed near the door] ; also a dark chandelier and a couple of large\nold chairs. In the Director-General's study, she described the carpet on the\nfloor, the sofa, two tables, and a large nosegay in one corner, and said that\n\f206 Dr. Alfred Backman.\nthere were many pictures, On being asked where the wife of the Director-\nGeneral was, she answered, in a little room,\u2014in the study, she was sitting\nthere reading a newspaper. When told to say what newspaper it was, the\nclairvoyant answered, after very great efforts, \" Sren-ska Dag-hla-del.\" She\nsaid the lady had on a black brocaded dress, of some thick material. On\nbeing asked if Madame A. had been at home the whole day, the clairvoyant\nanswered \"No \" ; and went on to say that Madame A. had paid a call at a\nplace quite near, at the house of a young couple, and she described one of\ntheir rooms, and how the young lady, who was wearing a dark blue morning\ndress, was playing with a baby a few months old ; she also gave a description\nof her husband and of a maid-servant. \" Do you recognise the young lady,\nAlma?\" \"No\u2014yes\u2014now I remember ! It is Mrs. R.\" (Here she gave the\nname of a young lady whom she had only seen once for a moment, a year\nbefore, when she was passing through Kahnar.)\nAt the request of Captain Smith, I told Alma to visit his home in\nNorrkoping. She obeyed, though unwillingly, and described correctly the\ndining-room and bedroom. In the latter was Madame Smith, giving\nmedicine to a little girl, who was coughing, and about whom she was very\nuneasy ; there was also an elderly maid-servant in the room.\nAlma was now awakened, and seemed well, healthy, and cheerful. When\nawake, she described still more distinctly the homes both of the Director-\nGeneral and of Captain Smith. According to information given later by\nthe Director-General, verbally and also in writing, Alma's description of his\nhouse was wonderfully accurate ; also his wife's dress, the call that she paid,\nthe young couple, and even, contrary to our supposition, the newspaper she\nhad been reading, were all correctly described.\nCaptain Smith also said that all she had said of his house was correct.\nThe little girl had been taken very seriously ill the same day, which was the\ncause of his having reached Kriikelund with his pilot-boat a little late, but\nhe had not told the reason to anyone present.\nThat all this is true and corresponds with the facts is attested by\nRobert von Rosen, Baron,\nCaptain of Pilotage, Kahnar.\nSo far the Baron von Rosen. I have received orally from the\nDirector-General a full account of how everything happened, which\nconfirms the above statements.1\nAnother time Alma was hypnotised quite unpremeditatedly and\nreceived an order to go to Stockholm to the house of the Director-\nGeneral of Pilotage, and see if he was at home. She said that he was,\n1 Dr. Backman writes later :\u2014\n\" Baron von Rosen made at once a sort of procis verbal of the experimenton board\nthe steamboat, and sent it to Madame Ankarcrona to know how much of it was true.\nThis procis verbal, which may still be in the possession of the Director-Genera), was\nread to me, so that I am able to state that the account sent to you, which was written\nby Baron von Rosen in June, 1889, is true and similar to the one received by Madame\nAnkarcrona, except that the latter had many more details init. Further, the Director-\nGeneral described the whole experiment to me this summer, and his account corre\nsponded perfectly with that of Baron von Rosen.\"\u2014En.\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 207\nhe was sitting at the writing-table in his study, writing. Among other\nthings that she observed and mentioned was that there was a bunch of\nkeys on the writing-table. She was now sharply ordered to seize the\nkeys and shake them, and to put her other hand on the Director-\nGeneral's shoulder, in order to attract his attention. This was repeated\ntwo or three times, and Alma declared that the Director-General really\nobserved her.\nThe Director-General, who had not the least idea that the experi\nment was taking place, was soon after informed of it, and has kindly\ntold me the following particulars about it. Before he heard of the\nexperiment, his attention had been fixed on the day and hour in\nquestion, because he had then experienced a very strange thing, which\nhad seemed to him unusual and remarkable in more respects than one.\nOn that occasion he was sitting, fully occupied with his work, when,\nwithout any reason whatever, his eyes fell on the bunch of keys lying\nnear him on the table. He then began to consider how he could have\nput the bunch of keys there, and why it was there, when he knew for\ncertain that he was never in the habit of leaving it there. While\nreflecting on this, he caught a glimpse of a woman. Thinking it was\nhis own maid-servant, he attached no importance to it, but, when the\noccurrence was repeated, he called her and got up to see what was the\nmatter. But he found nobody, and was informed that neither his\nservant nor any other woman had been in the room. He did not,\nhowever, observe any rattling of the bunch of keys or any movement\nof the keys.\nThe next experiment is, in my opinion, most important and\nsignificant, because thought-transference seems to have been quite\nexcluded. Though in this, as in every other case, inaccurate or\nincomplete statements occurred amongst the correct ones, I think that\neverything should be recorded.1\nOn April 8th, 1890, I received a letter from Dr. F. Kjellman, of\nStockholm, in which he asked me to arrange a time at which I should\nhypnotise Alma, of whom he had heard, and \"ask her to find a certain\nDr. von B.,who was known to her, and describe the room in which he was,\nthe other persons present, the arrangements of the room, &c. Dr. K.\nhad purposely hung something on the chandelier that is not generally\nthere, in order to make the experiment more crucial.\" In answer to\nthis, I merely sent this telegram, \" From 1 to 2 to-morrow, in your\n1 Dr. Backman Bays that all the notes made of the experiments with Dr. Kjellman\nwere sent to the latter before he (Dr. Backman) knew anything about whether they\nhad been successful or not. It is these notes which he has sent us, without adding\nanything to them.\u2014Ed.\n\f208 Dr. Alfred Backman.\napartment.\" No further arrangement was made, and Dr. Kjellman's\nappearance, as well as his apartment, was quite unknown both to me\nand the clairvoyant, and also to all the persons present with us. Alma\nwas hypnotised in my house at Kalmar, and the record made of the\nsitting is as follows :\u2014\nApril 9th, 1890, at 1.40 p.m. Alma is hypnotised and ordered to go to\nStockholm to the apartments of Dr. Kjellman. 1. \"Is Alma there?\"\n\"No.\" 2. Question repeated. \"Yes.\" 3. \" Is Dr. von B. in the apart\nments?\" \"Yes.\" 4. \"Are there any other persons besides him and Dr.\nKjellman in the same room?\" \"Yes, one more gentleman.\" (She could\nnot see anyone besides.) 5. \"What are they doing?\" \" One is sitting at\na writing-table. \" 6. \" Who is it, Dr. von B. or the other one?\" \"The\nother one, the doctor.\" 7. \"What are they doing?\" \" He is doing nothing ;\nthey are talking.\" 8. \"Are they dressed in an uncommon way?\" \"No.\"\n9. \"Is there a chandelier hanging from the ceiling ? \" \" No, no chandelier,\nsomething more like a lamp.\" 10. \"Do you see anything particular there?\"\n\" Something long and narrow is hanging in the chandelier.\" 11. \" What is\nit made of, stuff or metal?\" \"It must be metal, I think, and stuff also.\"\n12. \" Have you ever seen such a thing ? \" \" No, I never saw anything like\nit.\" 13. \"Try to see what it is, or what it is called.\" (No answer.) 14.\n' ' What is it used for ? \" \"I do not know what it is used for. \" \" Is it any\nthing used by physicians, or an ornament?\" \"More like an ornament,\nlarger than a ribbon. \" 15. \"What is it like, what colour is it?\" \" It is\nwhite.\" 16. \" Are there several colours ? \" \" It is also red. \" 17. \"What\nis the metal like?\" \"It is white, probably silver. \" 18. \"Are there mount\nings fixed to the stuff, or stuff on a piece of metal ? \" \"I think the stuff is\nwound round a piece of metal.\" 19. \"How long and how broad is it?\"\n\"A quarter of a yard broad, and three-quarters of a yard long.\" 20.\n\" What kind of stuff is it? \" \"Probably silk.\" 21. \"Does the stuff belong\nto the piece of metal? \" \"No, it is wound round it for the occasion.\" 22.\n\" What is it generally used for ?\" \"It ought to stand on a writing-table.\"\n23. \"What is the use of it?\" (She does not know.) 24. \"Is it fixed to\nthe lamp, or could it be easily taken off?\" \"It is not fixed firmly.\" 25.\n\" Can you take it off, Alma ? \" \"It does not seem to move.\" 26. \"Look\nat the stranger.

I cannot\nsee what the book is about. On the walls are several little pictures, five or\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 209\nsix, mostly portraits of elderly persons. There is a cupboard with glass\ndoors. I believe there are books in it.\" She cannot possibly tell what is\nhanging in the chandelier. When awake, she states that she believes\nit was a pair of scissors for cutting paper, or a paper-knife, that was\nhanging in the chandelier ; and it was probably fixed with a handkerchief.\nThere was also in the room a very long, stuffed easy-chair that could be pulled\ndown. She saw that Dr. von B. had spotted clothes on and was sitting\nnearly half asleep, looking upwards and reflecting. She thought they were\ntalking about something then happening in Stockholm, probably some\nexperiment that was being made by a society. She judged Dr. Kjellman to\nbe of middle height, with dark moustache, rather stout, his hair combed on\none side ; she thought his eyes were dark brown, and his nose crooked. The\nthird man was either a physician or a teacher.1 She believed there were two\nwindows in the room, which was a large one, and thought the curtains were\ndark and striped ; the fireplace was dark. She had not seen the other\nrooms, she entered a lobby first with three doors, and then through a room\ninto this one. Present, the undersigned :\u2014\nPhilip v. Tell, Kalmar,\nCaptain in the Regiment of Kalmar.\nAfter having communicated to Dr. Kjellman what Alma had said,\nI received from him two letters containing the following information :\u2014\n\"There was really hanging in the chandelier a large pair of paper-scissors,\nfixed by an indiarubber otoscope, and with a tea-rose and some forget-me-\nnots in one of the handles of the scissors. There was a large easy-chair\nthat could be pulled down in the room, and we were talking about an experi\nment, but it was one that was taking place just then, as I was experiment\ning on a hypnotised subject. Six persons were in the room. Most of the\nother things are wrong or prove nothing. It seems clear to me that she saw\nsomething, but she must have been confused by a number of ideas arising\nfrom the operation of her own brain.\"\nOn April 12th Dr. Kjellman wrote again :\u2014-\n\" I must apologise for my letter of yesterday,\u2014written during a recep\ntion,\u2014being so badly written and so incomplete.\n\" I will now add some points indicating that clairvoyance was going on.\nHer statement that the object was hanging in a lamp, not in a chandelier,\nwas right. It is both a lamp and a chandelier, and the lamp was drawn\ndown a long way under the chandelier. Another interesting thing was her\nmaintaining that it was my study ; she probably calls an ante-chamber a\nreception-room, as many people do.2 The fireplace is unusually dark, and\nhas a bookcase with glass doors standing near it. There are three doors in\nthe lobby, and it is necessary to pass through an outer room to enter the recep\ntion-room. But here her successes end ; the rest is confused or wrong (three\nwindows in the reception-room, not two ; the description of my appear\nance, of Dr. v. B.'s position, &c). The dentist \"Wessler was not badly\ndescribed.\"\n'Teacher in Swedish is lararc and physician is lakarc.\n2 I have tried this, and find that she really does so.\u2014A. Backman.\nP\n\f210 Dr. Alfred Backman.\nOn April 19th in the same year, another trial was made, this time\n,with two subjects at once. It was agreed with Dr. Kjellman that he\nshould write something in large letters on a piece of paper and put it in\na conspicuous position and strongly illuminated, and he also asked me by\na telegram to try to make them see \" what there was on the large table\nin the middle of the room.\"\nThis is the record of what was going on at Stockholm :\u2014,\nThe arrangements in Dr. Kjellman's reception-room on April 19th, 1890,\nat 7.40 p.m., were as follows :\u2014\nOn the wall between two windows a brightly illuminated sheet of paper\non which is written in large clear letters the word bordet (the table). On a\nlarge table in the middle of the room, a tray on which are placed (1) a dead\nhen, of a yellow-white colour, with a silver spoon in its bill, (2) two live\ncrayfish, (3) a large lamp with a blue shade.\nThe persons present were Dr. von B., Dr. Claus, Miss M. Kjellman, Miss\nThelander, the dentist Mr. Wessler, and Dr. Kjellman. A large yellow dog\nwas also in the room. The seance finished at 9.25. The medium of the party\nbecame slightly entranced, in a rather agitated way, and said on waking at\nS. 15 that somebody seemed to have been looking at her. Her hands felt cold.\n{ C. A. Claus.\n) F. Kjellman.\n(Signed) ^ c yoN B\nV John Wessler.\nAfter the trial the statements of one of the clairvoyants, Miss H.\nL s, were found to be all wrong, whereas Alma had this time again\nbeen successful in some points. I must observe that neither the subject\nnor I knew anything about where or how the paper was to be placed.\nMy record runs thus (the words in square brackets being put in\nafterwards by Dr. Kjellman) :\u2014\nApril 19th, 1890. 7.55 p.m. Alma Riidberg speaking.\n\"On an oblong table in the middle of the room, something high is\nstanding\u2014it must be some kind of case, it is dark and seems to be engraved.\nIt is certainly metal. [No such object on the oblong table.\u2014Kjellman.]\n(May it not be the lamp i\u2014Backman.) There are many things on the table\u2014\nthere are candles\u2014something very much like a little tray standing there,\nwith several small objects on it. I really do not know what they are used\nfor\u2014they must be instruments. \"\nAlma said, when awake, that \"on one corner of the table there was a\ntray with small objects on it, long and yellow. [The tray with the yellowish-\nwhite hen was standing on one corner of the table.\u2014Kjellman.] There was\nsomething on one wall, made of stuff, a confused mass. I wonder if it was\nnot part of the curtain.\"\nWhen asleep, she said, \"There is something standing upright on the\ntable\u2014it is something white, some paper\u2014the candles are beside it\u2014I think\nit is supported by a book. There is something written on the paper and it\nis that we have to read. I see the letters turned the right way\u2014the first\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 211\nletter looks like an A, the second like a B\u2014two more letters\u2014the paper is\nnot written all over, I think there are four letters, the third letter is R, the\nfourth looks like J or Y.\"\nWhen awake, she said, ''I believe the word was ' Bard ' or 'Hard'\u2014a short\nword with four letters. \" (The paper was fixed on the wall. It is strange that\nboth the clairvoyants seem to have seen it in connection with the table.)\nWhen asleep, she said, \" A tall dark person, I think a woman, is able to\nsee me.\" (The order to go up to that person, and strike her on her shoulder\nand force her to look at Alma, is mentally executed.\u2014Backman.) \"There are\nsurely four people there.\" When awake, she added, \"one had spectacles.\"\n[We were six ; I wear spectacles.\u2014Kjellman.] When asleep, she said,\n\" There is something else on the table\u2014like a man\u2014it does not represent\nanyone, it must be a bust \" ; and when awake, \"The statue looks like a man,\nand is standing on one of the corners of the table\u2014there are many candles,\nso that there is a clear light over the table.\" [Wrong.\u2014Kjellman.] When\nawake, she further said, \"There is a table in one corner with glasses and a\ndecanter on it.\" [Yes.\u2014Kjellman.] \"On a fireplace [Sofa.\u2014Kjellman] frieze\nthere were standing either high candles or vases\u2014some persons in an outer\nroom\u2014some kind of drapery in front of the door.\" [Wrong.\u2014Kjellman.]\nThere was a little dark gentleman whom she thought she had seen before.\nThe stance ended at 8.30.\nAbout this I may remark that all my clairvoyants have on similar\noccasions shown that they take great pride in describing correctly, and\nduring the experiments are quite able not to tell more than they wish.\nTherefore it was not to be expected that the clairvoyant could be got\nto confess that she saw a hen with a silver spoon in its bill and live\ncrayfish on the table in a physician's reception-room. I noticed also\nthat Alma seemed to be in an unusual condition that time, which\ncaused me to remark, in a private letter to Dr. Kjellman, accompanying\nmy record, that the clairvoyant had evidently not been well-disposed,\nand that I believed the result was not very good. Even in this case,\nhowever, there were some statements indicating that clairvoyance was\ngoing on.\nDuring one week, at a certain time every day, Dr. Kjellman placed\nin his room a paper with a word written on it and an object near it.\nAlma was not hypnotised for this, but was asked to try by herself to\ndiscover what was written on the paper and what the object was, before\nthe end of the week. At the end of the time, she said that the word\nbegan with the letter H, and referred to the object that was standing\nby it, but she could give no description of the object.\nDr. Kjellman informs me that the paper had written on it the word\nHund (dog), and beside it were placed a pistol and a vase for flowers.\nAnother subject had said that the object was a glass vase, possibly\non a stand.\nThe last trial made in conjunction with Dr. Kjellman took place on\np 2\n\f212 Dr. Alfred Backman.\nMay 1st in the same year, at 1.30 to 2 p.m. It was arranged that\nsomething should be written on a piece of paper and some common\nobjects put on a table. After having received my account, Dr,\nKjellman told me what the arrangements had been. On a little table\nnear the middle window was placed a sheet of paper supported by a\nphotograph stand. On the upper part of the paper was written Land\n(country) and below Torg (market-place). On another table there were\nseveral piles of books and a large nickel cup to hold visiting cards.\nTwo ladies and Dr. Kjellman were present.\nWith regard to this, Alma said that the paper was near the\nwindow (when awake, she said \" on the wall near the window \"), that\ntwo words were written on it\u2014the first letter was M, the second A, the\nthird R or N\u2014(when awake, that \" the word suggested something like\nspring, when you looked at it\"). \" On the table some square thing was\nlying. I think it is leather,\u2014it looks spotted\u2014I believe it is something\nto keep papers in (perhaps the cover of a book ?\u2014Backman), something\nelse that looks like a basket\u2014like a basket for fruit [yes, not unlike.\u2014\nKjellman], quite like a metal fruit-basket. I do not think there are\nmore than three people in the room, two ladies and a gentleman.\"\nI have tried several times to make the clairvoyants read in a\n(so-called) supersensuous manner, and they have succeeded pretty\nwell. I have never remarked any difference in the results when the\nhypnotiser knew the words or when they were quite unknown to all\npersons present. They have seldom read the actual words, generally\nthey only give a summary account of the meaning. I shall cite a few\nsuch experiments, some of which have been carried out by the clair\nvoyant putting the writing, well enclosed in a perfectly opaque\nenvelope, under her pillow, and trying to find out what was in it\nduring a natural sleep.\nRecord. Miss Ebba Lundberg received on February 7th an envelope\nsealed with five seals, inside which Dr. Backman had written something\nunknown to both of us. I, E. Lundberg, who had received no indication\nas to the content of the writing, returned the envelope to-day with the seals\nunbroken and uninjured, declaring that the writing contained something\nabout the power of hypnotism to cure illnesses, if only it is believed in.\nThe writing, which could not have been read by any ordinary means,\nwas opened by me, Sophie Louise Posse, and was found to contain a\nprescription form, on which was written in large letters, \" Believe and you\nwill be healed ! \"\nI affirm that this experiment was genuine and that no deceit was\nexercised.\n(Signed)\nKalmar, February 14th, 1890.\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance.\nIn a similar experiment at another time, Miss Lundberg said that\n,\" Kalmar \" was written on the paper. The word really was \" Karma,\"\nand it was the only word on the paper.\nOn another occasion I received an envelope sealed with many seals\nfrom one of my colleagues. He said that it contained a letter and\nbegged me to find out what it was about. It was not possible to see\nanything of it by normal eyes, and the clairvoyants (for I tried two)\nwere never allowed to touch it while they were alone, or in a way that\nrendered deceit possible.\nMiss Hilda Ljunggren, while hypnotised, gave a description first of\na town, plainly enough to make me understand that it was not a\nSwedish town, also a minute description of a man of 40, with luxuriant\nchestnut hair, long well-kept whiskers, nose slightly crooked, deep blue\neyes, a deep wrinkle from the root of the nose, fairly tall (may not all\nthis apply to Braid 1\u2014Backman), a learned man. She saw him sitting\nat a table, occupied with his work ; it seemed as if he had written a\nbook, which treated of hypnotism, and something more also\u2014something\nscientific. She said that the writing inside the envelope was not in\nthe form of a letter; it contained about six lines and expressed a doubt\nwhether hypnotism could help in certain cases ; two persons had\ndisputed about it.\nI communicated all this to my honoured colleague, at the same time\nreturning the envelope undamaged to him. He sent me back the\nenvelope intact, so that I might open it myself, which I did. It con\ntained a piece of notepaper, on which was written in four lines the\nmotto used by Braid in his book on Hypnotism : \" Unlimited scepti\ncism is equally the child of imbecility as implicit credulity.\"\nIn the month of October, 1888, the neighbourhood of Kalmar was\nshocked by a horrible murder committed in the parish of Wissefjerda,\nwhich is about 50 kilometres from Kalmar as the crow flies. What\nhappened was that a farmer, named P. J. Gustafsson, had been killed\nby a shot while driving, having been forced to stop by stones being put\non the road. The murder had been committed in the evening, and a\ncertain tramp was suspected because Gustafsson, in his capacity of\nunder-bailiff, had arrested him, and he had then undergone several\nyears' penal servitude.1\nThis was all that either I or the public knew about the case on\nNovember 1st in the same year ; the place where the murder was\ncommitted and the persons implicated in it were quite unknown both\nto me and to the clairvoyant.\nI I afterwards found that tbis statement aboutthe tramp being suspected was only\ninvented to allay the fears of the persons really suspected of the crime.\n\f214 Dr. Alfred Backman.\nOn the same day, November 1st, having some reason to believe\nthat such a trial would be at least partially successful, I experimented\nwith a clairvoyant, Miss Agda Olsen, to try if it was possible to get\nsome information in this way about such an event.\nThe judge of the neighbourhood, who had promised to be present,\nwas unfortunately prevented from coming. The clairvoyant was\nhypnotised in my wife's presence and was then ordered \" to look for\nthe place where the murder had been committed and see the whole\nscene, follow the murderer in his flight, and describe him and his home\nand the motive for the murder.\" Miss Olsen then spoke as follows,\nin great agitation, sometimes using violent gestures. I took notes of\nher exact words and reproduce them here fully.\n\" It is between two villages\u2014I see a road\u2014in a wood\u2014now it is coming\n\u2014the gun\u2014now he is coming along, driving\u2014the horse is afraid of the\nstones\u2014hold the horse ! hold the horse ! now ! now he is killing him\u2014he\nwas kneeling when he fired\u2014blood ! blood !\u2014now he is running in the\nwood\u2014seize him ! he is running in an opposite direction to the horse in\nmany circuits\u2014not on any footpaths. He wears a cap and grey clothes\u2014\nlight\u2014has long coarse brown hair,1 which has not been cut for a long time\n\u2014grey-blue eyes \u2014 treacherous looks \u2014 great dark brown beard \u2014 he is\naccustomed to work on the land. I believe he has cut his right hand. He\nhas a scar or a streak between his thumb and forefinger. He is suspicious\nand a coward.\n\" The murderer's home is a red wooden house, standing a little way back\nfrom the road. On the ground-floor is a room which leads into the kitchen\nand from that again into the passage. There is also a larger room which\ndoes not communicate with the kitchen. The church of Wissefjerda is\nsituated obliquely to your right when you are standing in the passage.\n\" His motive was enmity; it seems as if he had bought something\u2014taken\nsomething\u2014a paper. He went away from home at daybreak, and the\nmurder was committed in the evening.\"\nMiss Olsen was then awakened and, like all my subjects, she\nremembered perfectly what she had been seeing, which had made a\nvery profound impression on her ; she added several things which I did\nnot write down.\nOn November 6th (Monday) I met Miss Olsen, and she told me\nin great agitation that she had met the murderer from Wissefjerda\nin the street. He was accompanied by a younger person and followed\nby two policemen, and was walking from the police office to the gaol.\nI at once expressed my doubts of her being right, partly because\ncountry people are generally arrested by the country police, partly\nbecause they are always taken directly to gaol. But when she insisted\n1 On seeing the supposed murderer for the first time several months later, I could\ntest the accuracy of the description. He was bald, but had let the hair on his neck\ngrow long, and, by combing it over his head, hid his baldness completely.\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 215\non it, and maintained that it was the person she had seen when asleep,\nI went to the police office.\nI inquired if anyone had been arrested on suspicion of the crime\nin question, and a police-constable answered that such was the case,\nand that, as they had been taken to the town on Sunday, they had been\nkept in the police-station overnight and after that had been obliged to\ngo on foot to gaol, accompanied by two constables. As to what\nhappened at my visit to the police office, the police-constable, T. A.\nLjung, has kindly given the following account :\u2014\nAt Dr. A. Backman's request I give here an account of the occasion\nwhen he came to the police office and asked for me, who, he knew,1 had\nassisted in arresting the former farmer, Niklas Jonasson, and his son, Per\nAugust Niklasson, at Lassamala, in the parish of Wissefjerda, on suspicion of\nhaving murdered the farmer, Peter Johan Gustafsson, at Buggehult. Dr.\nBackman said that by hypnotising a woman he had obtained some informa\ntion about the murder from her.\nP. J. Gustafsson had been murdered on October 24th, 1888, probably\nabout 4 p.m., on the public road between the villages of Buggehult and\nLassamala. On November 4th the aforesaid persons, being strongly\nsuspected of being the murderers, were arrested by J. Malmberg, the\nsuperintendent of the police in Kalmar, on which occasion I was present.\nOn November 6th, in the same year, Dr. Backman came to the police\noffice, wishing to speak to the superintendent, but the latter not being\npresent at the moment, he addressed himself to me with regard to a\nmemorandum that he brought with him and read to me. He put several\nquestions to me about the place where the murder was committed, the\ndwelling of the persons suspected of the murder, &c. Dr. Backman on\nthis occasion described quite accurately the appearance of the house, its\nfurniture, how the rooms were situated, where the suspected men lived, and\ngave a very correct account of Niklas Jonasson's personal appearance.\nThe doctor also asked me if I had observed that Jonasson had a scar on his\nright hand. I had not then observed it, but since then I have ascertained\nthat it really is so, and Jonasson says that he got it from an abscess.\nOne of Dr. Backman's assertions\u2014that the. church of that or another\nparish could be seen from the house of the supposed murderers\u2014did not\naccord with the facts.2\nI am convinced that Dr. Backman could not possibly have got this\ninformation in any ordinary way, and I also know that the hypnotised subject\nhad not, up to that time, seen the parish of Wissefjerda and consequently\ncould not have the least idea of the appearance of the place.\nI affirm the truth of this account on my honour and conscience.\n(Signed and sealed) T. A. Ljung,\nPolice-constable at Kalmar.\nKalmar, June, <2lt\\ 1889.\n1 A constable in the outer room had told me this.\u2014Backman.\n2 It is, however, correct if you suppose it possible to see through a large forest.\u2014\nBackman.\n\f216 Dr. Alfred Baxkman.\nThe trial was a long one and showed that Gustafsson had agreed to\nbuy for Jonasson, but in his own name, the latter's farm, which was\nsold by auction on account of Jonasson's debts. (This is what is called\na thief's bargain.) Gustafsson bought the farm, but kept it for him\nself. The statements of the accused men were very vague ; the father\nhad prepared an alibi with much care, but it failed to account for just\nthe length of time that was provably enough to commit the murder in.\nThe son tried to prove an alibi by means of two witnesses, but these\nconfessed that they had given false evidence, which he had bribed\nthem to do when they were in prison with him on account of another\nmatter.\nBut though the evidence against the defendants was very strong, it\nwas not considered that there was sufficient legal evidence, and\u2014there\nbeing no jury in Sweden\u2014they were left to the verdict of posterity.\nAs mentioned at the beginning of my account, I have sometimes in\ncarrying on these experiments made the clairvoyant look, while awake,\nin a little crystal, placed in a small wooden tablet (Hansen's model).\nI will give here only one example, and one which might be explained\nby thought-transference\u2014as there was one person in the room who\nknew of the events described.\nI told the clairvoyant, Miss Olsen, to see in the crystal what Miss\n, who was present, had been doing the night before. After a few\nmoments, she said that she saw a meadow in the crystal, and in it a\ncertain number (giving the number correctly) of ladies and gentlemen,\nwho were dancing and drinking champagne. This seemed to her very\nimprobable, because it was then November, a season that is not chosen\nin this country for picnics. She described minutely several other\nthings which were not written down, but were quite correct, according\nto what Miss said later on.1\nI have sometimes tried to discover whether a clairvoyant could\nreally see something that had not yet taken place, but there are\nmany reasons why all my experiments cannot, at least for the present,\nbe published. I will give only two instances, which seem to me\nremarkable in several respects.\n1 In a letter dated December 19th, 1890, Dr. Backman says :\u2014\n\" Several persons were present. No notes were taken, but the story made so much\nsensation that it has not been forgotten. Miss supplemented the account to-day\nby reminding me that on looking into the crystal, Miss Olsen first gave a perfect\ndescription of a lady with whom Miss had talked on meeting her in the street\nthe day before; she described her face, her dress, &c. , very accurately, and said\nbesides that she had two gold rings on the fourth finger of her left hand (a sign of\nmarriage). After that Miss Olsen suddenly began to laugh and said : ' Miss is\nin a merry company\u2014they are dancing\u2014the corks of the champagne bottles are\njumping, &c.' Miss cannot remember that any wrong detail was given by\n\fExperiments in Clairvoyance. 217\nSome days before Christmas, 1888, I hypnotised Miss Hilda\nLjunggren, and asked her to go to the castle at Stockholm and see the\nKing's Christmas presents as they would be arranged on Christmas\nEve. She then, making a great effort, described some things which I\nwrote down ; she saw them placed in a room, and described, for\ninstance, a piece of stuff of an artistic kind, such as is found at the\n\"Society for the Promotion of Art Needlework\" at Stockholm. It was\nspread over a sofa, but she could not tell if it was a sofa-cover, or a\nportiere, or a curtain. Another thing\u2014an image, as she called it\u2014she\ncould not look at, because such a strong light was coming from it that\n\" it hurt her eyes.\"\nThe editor of the Kalmar newspaper, The Barometer, has kindly\ngiven the following evidence :\u2014\nAccording to Dr. Backman's request, I state that I received from him\non December 23rd, 1888, a sealed envelope, which I kept, carefully locked\nup. On December 28th of the same year, I opened the envelope in the\npresence of M. Jonsson, the sub-editor, and of G. Ekerot. It contained\nthe following writing :\u2014\nHis Majesty the King will receive, among other Christmas gifts,\n(1) A piece of sculpture, representing an equestrian figure.\n(2) A case or box of a curious yellow colour.\n(3) Something uncommon, that I cannot name, shining, and about one\nfoot high, the lower part of it in the form of a pillar.\n(4) A brown and black portfolio containing pictures or drawings.\n(5) A clock.\n(6) A piece of stuff (or a sofa-cover) of art texture.\n(7) An image with quite a flood of light about it.\n(8) A china vase, with flowers on a light ground.\"\nKalmar, June 17th, 1889.\nWe testify that the writing which was enclosed in the envelope con\ntained exactly what has been quoted above.\nMiss Olsen, except that she thinks the number of persons present was not correctly\ngiven.\"\nWith Dr. Backman's permission, we wrote to Miss asking for her confirmation\nof these incidents, and she has kindly replied as follows :\u2014\n\" I am very willing to give you a description of what I saw and heard at Dr.\nBackman's, the day he has mentioned in his letter to you.\n\" When I came to him, he made a hypnotic experiment with Miss Olsen, who\nshould endeavour to find some papers lying somewhere in Dr. Backman's apartment,\nand, to my great surprise, she succeeded in finding them. After her being awakened,\nDr. Backman gave her a large glass button and asked her to look in it and see if she\ncould find out what I had done the day before.

The inquest was held on the 21st, and the divisional\nsurgeon in his evidence gave his opinion that death was due to suffocation by strangu\nlation. The Times observes that the mystery can only be compared to that which\nattended the recent series of crimes in the same district. The account of the inquest\nshows that the body was discovered very soon after the murder. There seems, how\never, to have been some further doubt as to the cause of the death, since the police\nauthorities informed us in answer to our inquiries that the woman, who was named\nCatherine Millet, died in a drunken sleep and not by homicidal violence. However,\nthe Times of December 29th states that \"nothing of the nature of a clue has been\ndiscovered, and the medical men still adhere to the opinion that deceased was foully\nmurdered.\"\nThe discrepancies between the English accounts and that appearing in the\nKalmar Barometer were pointed out to Dr. Backman, and we further askeil him if\nsupposed Whitechapel murders were often reported in the Swedish newspapers,\nor if this was the only case about that time. He replies :\u2014,\n\" When Alma predicted the murder, there had not been any notices about\n' Jack ' for two or three months ; since the notice about the woman found murdered\nand mutilated in the Thames at the end of the summer of 1888 up to the middle of\n1889, there was no other notice of a murder supposed to have been committed by\n' Jack ' except that of the murder of December 22nd, 1888, and if that notice was\nnot true, it was not invented in Sweden. It appeared in all the Swedish Press, and I\nsaw it first in the journal Dagens Nyheter of December 28th.\"\nIt will be observed that, whatever the facts about the supposed murder were,\nthere remains a very striking coincidence between Alma's predictions and the state\nments in the Kalmar Barometer.\u2014Ed.\n\f220 Dr. Alfred Baekman.\neight soldiers searched for it in vain for half-a-day. Some days after\nwards, I hypnotised Anna Samuelsson and went with her, still asleep,\nto the held, where I told her to search for the revolver. She went to\na certain spot in the field, where she kept on going from side to side,\nbut could not find the revolver. I then asked if she could tell me\nwhether I should succeed in finding it. Yes, she answered, she saw\nLieutenant Werner wearing it again.\nNext day I suggested to another young patient named Cecilia, that\nwhen she went away from the military hospital, where we then were,\nshe should go to the spot where the revolver was lying, take it out of\nthe sand, and give it to me on the following day.\nWhen she came to me on the following day, she actually brought\nthe revolver with her. Her mother told me that when Cecilia went\naway from the hospital, she walked straight to a very sandy part of\nthe field (which I afterwards found was the same place that Anna\nwent to), removed a little sand and found the revolver, which is now\nagain worn by its owner.\nA.

Double Consciousness. 221\nIII.\nA CASE OF DOUBLE CONSCIOUSNESS.\nBy Richard Hodgson, LL.D.\nThe case which I am about to relate has many points of interest.\nThe secondary condition has, so far as can be ascertained, occurred only\nonce in the lifetime of the subject ; and the memory of it, entirely\nlost during waking hours, is easily, though incompletely, brought back\nby putting the patient into the hypnotic trance.\nAnsel Bourne, at the time of his seizure, was an itinerant preacher\n61 years old, and residing in the small town of Greene, in the State of\nRhode Island. One morning, whilst apparently in his usual state of\nhealth, he disappeared, and in spite of the publicity which the news\npapers gave to the fact, and the efforts of the police to find him, he\nremained undiscovered for a period of two months, at the end of which\ntime he turned up at Norristown, Pennsylvania, where for the previous\nsix weeks he had been keeping a small variety store under the name of\nA. J. Brown, appearing to his neighbours and customers as a normal\nperson, but being, as it would seem, in a somnambulistic condition all\nthe while. As Elder Bourne's life presents at least one other incident\nof great interest, I shall give a sketch of its entire course, as an\nintroduction to my account of the episode which forms the main sub\nject of this paper.\nAnsel Bourne is of New England parentage, and was born in New\nYork city, July 8th, 1826. His maternal grandfather \" lost his mind\"\nlate in life (\"about 70 \"), but seems to have had no acute form of\ninsanity. His father \"became dissipated,\" so that Ansel's mother\nand he separated when Ansel was only seven years old, and the\nboy's early life was spent in poverty, with little schooling and much\nwork, until at the age of 15 he was set to learn the carpenter's trade\nat Olneyville, Rhode Island. From then to the age of 31 he worked\nat his trade at various places in that State. Being of a serious turn\nof mind, he read and studied a good deal in his leisure moments, and\nfrom having become a member of the Baptist Church, changed at last\ninto a convinced atheist, not of the disputatious and aggressive sort,\nbut silent and stubborn, as he is wont to be in other matters which are\nexclusively \"his own business.\" Meantime he had married, in 1854,\nand had children, and in 1857 was living at Westerly, R.I., next door\nto Mr. Taylor, minister of the so-called \" Christian \" Church, for whom\n\f222 R. Hodgson.\nhe had come to cherish a decided feeling of enmity. In relating the\ncrisis of that year, I abridge the account given in a pamphlet 1 which\nhas had a wide circulation.\nOn Thursday, August 6th, 1857, he was brought home from South Kings\nton in a condition of sickness, perhaps induced by labouring beyond his\nstrength at the place of Mr. Rowland G. Hazard. After reaching home\n(accompanied by Mr. J. E. Brown), he rested through Friday, Saturday,\nand Sunday, and was very much restored. Feeling well and comfortable on\nMonday morning, August 10th, he was disposed to return to his work at\nSouth Kingston, a distance of near thirty miles. But Mrs. Bourne per\nsuaded him to relinquish the idea, and remain at home that week. He\ntherefore remained, and occupied himself with labours of improvement upon\nhis own place\u2014painting and so forth, until Thursday night. On Friday,\nAugust 14th, the hottest day of the season, he went to work in his garden.\nBetween the hours of one and two p.m. he experienced much pain in his\nhead, and was obliged to relinquish his work and go into the house. After\nstaying, perhaps, three-quarters of an hour the pain left him and he returned\nto his work in the garden. He worked until it was dark, at night, when he\nwent into the house, and enjoyed refreshing sleep through the night. In\nthe morning, on Saturday, he felt considerable pain in his head, which con\ntinued through the day. At night the pain ceased so that he again enjoyed\na good night's rest.\nOn the afternoon of Sunday, which was the 16th of August, having no\nscruples about working on Sunday as freely as any day, he went to work,\npreparing to leave home again for awhile. About 4 o'clock he went out to\ncut some wood, when, having some feeling in his head which he does not\nremember so that he can describe it, he put his hand to his head, and this\nwas the last that he can remember that took place, or of which he was con\nscious at the time, until Tuesday, the 18th. From Tuesday morning until\nWednesday in the afternoon he was perfectly conscious of his condition,\nexcept, as friends affirm, that he was a little delirious on Tuesday night. He\nran down rapidly and his restoration or recovery became very doubtful.\nThis was understood to be the judgment of his physician, Dr. Thurston.\nOn Wednesday his mother visited him. She asked him if he was ready to\ndie. He answered that he was. But this answer was given without a single\nthought of God, or a state of existence beyond the grave. All his thoughts\nof anxiety were about his family. To leave them was painful.\nSoon after, a change took place, and he rapidly recovered. In about\nthree weeks he was able to return to his work at South Kingston. It was\non Monday, September 7th, that he went to that place. He was able to\n> \" Wonderful Works of God: A narrative of the wonderful facts in the case of\nAnsel Bourne, of West Shelby, Orleans Co., N.Y., who, in the midst of opposition\nto the Christian religion, was suddenly struck blind, dumb, and deaf ; and after 18\ndays was suddenly and completely restored, in the presence of hundreds of persons, in\nthe Christian Chapel at Westerly, on the loth of November, 1857.

On Friday, by advice of his friends, he returned\nhome again. On Monday, September 14th, Dr. Thurston visited him, and\ncontinued his attendance by frequent visits until about the 1st of October.\nDuring this month he broke down twice in attempting to work, and had to\ngo to bed. But, on the whole, he improved, so that by the 28th he thought\nhimself about well.\nOn Sunday the 25th of October he spent the day and evening at his own\nhouse, playing at cards. He was so settled in his ideas of right and privilege\nto do as he pleased on that day, that if the Christian minister, who lived\nnext door to him, Rev. John Taylor, had come into his house, he is sure he\nshould not have moved from his seat. Some of those who thus spent the\nday with him have since united with the Christian Church in Westerly. This\nplaying was not for money, but merely for amusement. He has never played\nfor money.\nOn the 28th of October he started for the village of Westerly, about one\nmile to the north of his house. When he had gone perhaps a quarter of a\nmile, and had begun to descend towards the village, he was perceived by\nsome persons to be walking quite fast, as though feeling quite well. He was\nconscious of no unusual feelings, until a thought came up vividly in his mind\nthat he ought to go to meeting (i.e., to church). This thought was connected\nwith no conscientious feeling of duty to go to meeting, but seemed a mere\ninternal and unaccountable suggestion. To the suggestion he answered,\n\"Where ? \" To this inquiry he was answered in the same manner, \"To the\nChristian chapel.\" To this idea his spirit rose up in decided and bitter\nopposition, and he said within himself, \" I would rather be struck deaf and\ndumb for ever than to go there.\" He continued onward for eighteen or\ntwenty rods, when a friend of his passed by him on a lumber-reach, to whom he\nbowed as the man passed. Immediately afterwards he felt dizzy, and desired\nto sit down. Looking ahead he saw nothing that he could sit down on.\nTurning back he saw at a little distance a flat stone close to the side of a\nstone wall. He went to that immediately and sat down. He leaned his\nhead against the wall and felt immediately relieved of his dizziness, and\nsupposed he should be able in a minute or two to proceed on his business. He\nthen looked up the road, toward home, and saw an aged man, Mr. John\nThompson, approaching him, on foot, beside a waggon. Mr. Thompson was\nnear the place where he had been a few minutes before, when the idea was\nsuggested to him that he ought to go to meeting. In an instant, after\nbeholding Mr. Thompson, it seemed as though some powerful hand drew\nsomething down over his head, and then over his face, and finally over his\nwhole body ; depriving him of his sight, his hearing, and his speech, and\nrendering him perfectly helpless. Yet he had as perfect power of thought\nas at any time in his life. His mind instantly went back to the conflict of\nhis thoughts, some eight or ten minutes before. The terrible decision and\nchoice, ' ' I would rather be struck deaf and dumb for ever, than go to the\nChristian chapel,\" came before him with awful significance. It seemed that\nGod had truly taken him at his word, and given him what he had chosen.\nThe decision of ten years before, \"If there is a God, and He will show me\nfrom His hand, I will believe in Him,\" now came to memory. In this, too\n\f224 R. Hodgson.\nit appeared that God had taken him at his word. He trembled, and his\nsoul, as though sinking in deep waters, acknowledged, \" There is a God.\"\nThe sins of a whole lifetime came before his mind in an instant, like a flash\nof lightning. And how awful was everything ! He was not only deaf and\ndumb, but, more dreadful still, he was perfectly blind. He saw no one\u2014he\nheard no one\u2014he could call no one\u2014and all his strength was gone. Then\nthe dreadful question, \" Am I to remain in this condition ? \" He thought\nthat he was about to die. And he dared not in his secret soul ask God to\ntake him to Himself. It appeared to him that such a request would be a\ngreater insult to a holy and just God than even all his former sins. He dared\nnot to think of so insulting God. He could not speak to ask forgiveness of\nthose whose forgiveness he would have gladly sought.\nAfter the brief space of what he thinks could not have been more than\ntwo or three minutes, he was taken up and put in a waggon, and carried away.\nHe was perfectly sensible of all this, although he could hear nothing, see\nnothing, and communicate nothing. He felt the motion of the waggon and\nthe touch of hands, and supposed he was being carried towards home, which\nwas the case. He knew and realised perfectly when he was carried into the\nhouse and placed in a chair. He wondered why they should have placed him\nin a chair rather than on a bed. In a little time after, he felt the touch of\nhands again, which took him from the chair and placed him on a bed.\nDr. William T. Thurston was called immediately. In a letter which he\nwrote to the Providence Journal, under date of November 20th, he says of\nthis visit, \" I heard nothing more of him (after the 2nd of October) till the\n28th of that month, when in haste I was summoned to him. On reaching\nhis bedside I found him perfectly insensible\u2014very much in the condition\nof a person in a fainting fit. The pupils of his eyes were quite insensible of\nlight, widely dilated and not contracting on the application of sudden and\nvivid light. He was, in fact, perfectly insensible.\"\nMr. Bourne does not wish to question the honesty and sincerity of\nDr. Thurston, when he says, \"He was, in fact, perfectly insensible.\" He\nsupposes the doctor might have thought so, for he gave him no evidence\nto the contrary. Yet, he says, he was perfectly sensible to the touch of\nhands, which he supposed at the time to be those of Dr. Thurston. He\nknew perfectly well when his eyelids were touched and drawn ; yet he saw\nnothing, he heard nothing, and lay helpless as an infant. When different\nhands touched him he reasoned with himself, and thought he knew which\nwas the doctor and which was his wife, when they were handling him in any\nway. When touched, at certain times, he felt confident that it was by his\nchildren. He was not insensible, as the doctor seems to have supposed.\nHis mind was perfectly active all of the time, but he was unable to\ncommunicate any thought or feeling which he had to others, so that they\ncould know that he was sensible of what was passing. About him all was as\nsilent as though there were neither a God, nor life, nor motion in the whole\nwide universe. This silence was as though the soul had been cast into a\ndeep, bottomless, and shoreless sepulchre, where dismal silence was to reign\neternally. He fully acknowledged the justice of God in his condemnation,\nand spurned from his soul the thought of insulting God by asking mercy for\nsuch a sinner. He scorned to ask for mercy when it was not his due.\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 225\nDuring the night he gained some strength, and at a time which he\nsupposes to have been near morning he was anxious to know where he was,\nand whether he had really been placed in his own house, and among his\nfriends. But how could he know ? He recollected the form of the bedstead\nposts, and the position which the bed occupied, upon which he supposed he\nwas then lying. He felt of the posts and thought he was certain of their\nidentity. He reached out near the head of the bed, to see if there was a\nwindow, and found there was. He was then fully satisfied that he was in his\nown house.\nAt a certain time which he supposed to be morning, he felt movements\non his bed, and soon was satisfied that his little children were with him and\nwere kissing him. Their familiar expression of \" Pa ! \" he could no longer hear,\nnor any sound which their movements made. He could see nothing of\nthese loved ones, but he was sure they were there, and that they were address\ning him as they had done before. But the silence was too deep to be\nbroken, and appeared too awful to be endured.\nIn the afternoon, about twenty-six hours from the time he was stricken\ndown, when subject to no unusual sensation or feeling in his head, his sight was\nrestored in an instant. He saw his wife and one of his neighbours standing\nnear, with their lips in motion. They appeared to be addressing him, as\nthough unconscious of his inability to hear. It appeared to him then that\nthey were ignorant of his deafness. He made signs of writing on his hand,\nwhen his wife immediately procured a pen and paper. While she was gone\nafter pen and paper the question arose in his mind, \" Are you now willing\nto ask forgiveness of all those whom you have injured?\" To this question\nhe answered affirmatively. When she came to him he took pen and paper\nand wrote that he could not hear.\nDuring the forenoon, remembering the enmity he had cherished toward\nRev. John Taylor, he wrote upon a slate requesting that he might be sent\nfor. This request was complied with, and Mr. Taylor came immediately.\nMr. Bourne asked his forgiveness by writing. Mr. Taylor seized his hand,\npressing it so earnestly, and with evident sympathy, that he felt fully\nassured that his enmity was freely forgiven. Mr. Bourne inquired of him if\nhe would go after Mr. Joshua Thompson, Jun.\u2014toward whom he had\ncherished so much enmity, that he had said if he saw him drowning he would\nnot help him.\nToward evening Mr. Charles W. Thompson, a brother of Mr. Joshua\nThompson, Jun., came in, and took him by the hand. He inquired after\nhis health, and then added, \" Will not your brother come ? \" Just as Mr.\nBourne wrote this question, and put it to Mr. Thompson, his brother\nentered. He saw him approach, and he seemed to glide up to him like a\nshadow, for to him his approach was as noiseless as though the man had been\na spirit only. He then took the slate and wrote, \" Will you forgive me ? \"\nThe answer of Mr. Thompson relieved him greatly.\nAs soon as he had effected a reconciliation with his fellow men, he felt\na great measure of relief. He then felt emboldened to approach God. He\nbegan, in the solemn and silent depths of his soul, to offer unutterable\nprayer. His tongue was chained to his teeth when he attempted to utter\nwords. He could use it freely, when eating, to move his food. He could\nQ\n\f226 R. Hodgson.\nuse it to clean his teeth, as freely as need be, but when he attempted to\nform words it was as though chained to his forward teeth. He says that the\nidea of his having no use of his tongue is wholly erroneous. But he could\nnot use it for speech. He could pray, but his prayers were the supplications\nof the mind ; his bodily powers not participating in the act of supplication.\nMr. Bourne then requested a prayer meeting at his house. Although he\ncould lend no listening ear to the supplications of those present, yet, as he\nsaw their faces turned towards Heaven, and their lips in motion, he felt\nassured that they were praying for him. He became calm. He wrote letters\nto his friends signifying his decision to be henceforth on the Lord's side. In\nthis way he sought to confess Christ. To these letters he received kind and\naffectionate replies.\nOn Wednesday, November 11th, just two weeks from the time that he\nwas stricken down, he was carried to the Christian Chapel. As he passed\nalong he could see the people moving and receive visible tokens of their\nrecognition, but it was all in silence. People seemed gliding about so noise\nlessly that to him it was as though he was among the moving dead. Passing\ninto the chapel, his feelings were very deep, as he entered the vestry among\nthe people he had a little time before so much despised. He wrote a brief\nmessage upon his slate, which was read to the assembly. He then wished\nto signify to the people his determination to live for the honour of God\nby standing up before the congregation, and holding up his hands.\nThe appearance of Mr. Bourne at that time is described in the Christian\nMessenger, edited by Mr. Cummings, as follows : \"He was carried to the\nchurch, his communications were read, after which, with streaming eyes, he\narose and lifted his arms towards Heaven, and expressed as best he could\nhis gratitude for God's mercy.\"\nDuring this week he went several times to the chapel service in deep\nemotion, but with his aphonia still unbroken. On the morning of Sunday,\nNovember 15th, Mr. Bourne says he felt more anxious than ever to speak.\nHis distress, because he could not speak, was exceedingly great, and he\ntried harder than ever to speak to his wife ; but he found it impossible.\nWhen he considered he had the most free use of his tongue for everything\nelse but to speak with, and was unable to utter a single word, it seemed to\nhim more than he could endure.\nHe went to chapel twice, and what happened in the afternoon is thus\ndescribed. He wrote on the slate the following message, which was read to\nthe congregation by the minister :\u2014\n\" I have been led to think, while sitting here, why I have been called\nfrom the ranks of sinners, and I have been led to think that God has some\nthing for me to do. Why I have come up here to the place of all others\nwhich three weeks ago I would have shunned, I know not. But, oh ! how\nmarvellous are the ways of God ! But here I am, for what, I know not.\nBut, O God ! show me what Thou wouldst have me to do, and with Thy\nhelp, O God, I will do it ! O sinners ! you cannot say this is excitement !\nO no ! for I had not attended any of the meetings 1 No, I have heard no\npreaching\u2014no prayers ! No, all has seemed still to me ! Oh, if you cannot\nbelieve now, you would not if one had risen from the dead ! Oh, I feel as\nthough the prayers of the dumb had been heard ! Why I feel as I do this\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 227\nafternoon, I cannot tell, but I do feel as though God was about to speak\nto Westerly, in what way I know not\u2014but oh, may God's will be done.\"\nThe effect produced by the reading of this communication upon the\naudience was very great ; but the effect of what immediately followed was\nextraordinary beyond description. At the suggestion made by Mr. Taylor\nfor him to rise as he had desired to do, he arose in the pulpit, with the most\nevident calmness, and lifted up his hands toward Heaven. He then, feeling\nhappy, clapped his hands without hearing the least sound. He then\nextended his hands apart, as at first, when, in an instant, every manner of\nsound which came from the moving things of nature broke upon his ear,\ndistinct as a peal of thunder, and his tongue was unloosed instantly, his\ncountenance changed, and he exclaimed, in the hearing of the whole crowded\nassembly, \"Glory to God and the Lamb for ever.\" Big drops of perspiration\nchased each other downward from his temples.\nWhat immediately followed is described by the editor of the Christian\nMessenger, who has before been referred to as being present, as follows :\n' ' He fell upon his knees, and soon commenced praying in a soft, clear tone\nof voice, and praising God for what He had done. He then gave a most\nfeeling exhortation to his friends, neighbours, and all present, urging them\nto seek the salvation of their souls, and live for God. We do not think it\nan exaggeration when we say there was not a dry eye in the place. How\nwonderful are the works of the Almighty ! We were ready to exclaim, as\nsome said, when Jesus cured the sick of the palsy : ' We have seen strange\nthings to-day.' All seemed to be amazed, and many glorified God for His\nmighty work, which He did in the presence of them all. Ifis hearing and\nspeech were both returned, and many hundreds witnessed a most solemn\nvow from him to spend the remnant of his days in doing the will of God, so\nfar as he could know it.\" 1\n1 Dr. Thurston, who attended Mr. Bourne, wrote the following letter about the\ncase to the Providence Journal :\u2014\nWesterly, R.I., November 20th, 1857.\nOn a visit in a neighbouringvillage, a day or two since, my attention was directed\nto the articles in your journal of the 17th and 18th instants, relating to the \" Singular\nCase,\" the \" Tough Story,\" the \" Strange Story from Westerly.\" A singular case it\ncertainly was, but when shorn of the embellishments attached to the narrative it\nceases to be either a tough or a strange story.\nThe case of Mr. Ansel Bourne passed under my professional notice and care,\nand, with your permission, I will give a truthful description of the same.\nI have known Mr. Bourne for seven years past, and during that period he has\ninvariably conducted himself with propriety in the community, so much so as to\nmerit and retain the respect of his fellow citizens. In the early part of August last,\nor rather about the middle of the month, Mr. Bourne suffered a coup de soleil, which\nwas of a very formidable character, and from its effects he nearly lost his life.\nHaving nearly recovered from the illness, he thought himself able to return to his\noccupation, that of a house' carpenter. Contrary to my advice, and without my\nknowledge, he left his home, and went to South Kingston to superintend the com\npletion of a dwelling-house he had been engaged upon. On the 14th of September he\nwas brought home again ill, and suffering from a severe cerebral disturbance. My\nattendance was continued till the 2nd of October, and I heard nothing more of him\ntill the 28th of that month, when in haste I was summoned to him. On reaching his\nbedside, I found him (perfectly insensible)\u2014very much in the condition of a person\nQ 2\n\f22S R. Hodgson.\nMr. Bourne's use of his faculties from this day onwards has been\ncomplete. But two weeks after the last event in the chapel, he had,\nwhilst in bed at night, a vision like the image of a man in form, only\nwith a face like the sun in brightness, lighting up the room, and say\ning, \" Settle up your worldly business, and go to work for me.\" This\nvision came back several times in the same night, he being all the\nwhile wide awake, and speaking of it to his wife, who saw nothing.\nThe result of all these experiences was to make Mr. Bourne adopt the\nprofession of an evangelist. His ministrations were in great request in\nmany country towns, and for thirty years more or less he has worked\nhard, conducting Sunday services, speaking at revivals, officiating at\nfunerals, and performing strenuously all the offices which the position\nof an unattached minister demands, not forgetting, of course, to cite\nhis own personal experience, when necessary, to illustrate the power\nof the Lord. During this time he often spoke as much as six or seven\ntimes in the week ; and this, with the incessant travelling, he thinks\nwas not nearly as good a life for his health as the trade of a carpenter,\nto which, within the last eight years, he has returned. His first wife\ndied in 1881, and his second wife, formerly Mrs. Belle Potter, whom\nhe married in 1882, disapproved of his absences from home in the\ncourse of his preaching, so that he confined his labours to his imme\ndiate vicinity. On this account he became somewhat troubled, thinking\nthat he was not so active in religious work as he should be. This\nthought that he was not \" on the path of duty \" weighed on his mind,\nand he seems inclined to think that if he had been in active religious\nin a syncope, swoon, or fainting fit. The pupils of his eyes were quite insensible to\nlight, widely dilated, and not contracting on the application of sudden and vivid\nlight. He was, in fact (perfectly insensible). Powerful counter-irritants were\napplied, to which he gave no evidence of feeling. Various, and I may say, judicious\nremedies were resorted to, which, as this is not intended to be a medical treatise, it is\nnot necessary to enumerate. Suffice it to say, that on my visit to him on the following\nFriday I found consciousness had, in a measure, been restored. (His sight was then\nevidently perfect, but there Btill continued great disturbance of his brain, confusion\nof intellect, with vacant staring. I mention these circumstances, to show the fact\nthat Mr. Bourne's case is clearly attributable to adisturbed and disordered condition of\nthe functions of the brain, and, if possible, to do away with the absurd and super\nstitious notion that there is anything marvellous or miraculous in the case.)\n(The loss of hearing and of speech was owing to a paralysis of the motor nerve of\nthe tongue, known as the hypoglossal nerve, and of the auditory nerve.) The recovery\nwas owing to no wonderful nor miraculous power, but may be accounted for in a very\nrational and philosophical manner. Mr. Bourne had been treated actively by electro-\ngalvanism and those remedies which intelligent physicians resort to in the treatment\nof paralysis.\n(The legitimate result of the treatment was recovery. It was not sudden nor\n,unexpected. ) (The opinion expressed to the patient and his friends, that the remedies\nused were well calculated to restore him, and, in my judgment, would do so, was\nrealised ; and to the sober-minded and rational portion of the community created no\nemotions, save those of pleasure, in hearing of the restoration to comparative health of\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 229\nservice, and therefore contented with his work, the experiences which\nhe subsequently underwent would never have occurred.\nJanuary 17th, 1887, he went from his home in Coventry, R.I., to\nProvidence, in order to get money to pay for a farm which he had\narranged to buy, leaving his horse at Greene Station, in a stable, expect\ning to return the same afternoon from the city. He drew out of bank\n$551, and paid several small bills, after which he went to his nephew's\nstore, 121, Broad-street, and then started to go to his sister's house on\nWestminster-street. This was the last that was known of his doings\nat that time. He did not appear at his sister's house, and did not\nreturn to Greene, where his horse remained for about three weeks,\nand was finally taken away by Mrs. Bourne.\nOn Thursday, January 20th, the following paragraph appeared in\nthe Bulletin, of Providence, R.I., the information having been given\nby the police :\u2014\nA Missing Preacher.\nThis morning Mrs. Bourne, the wife of Rev. Ansel Bourne, of Greene\nStation, called at police headquarters and reported that her husband had\nbeen missing since Monday last. Rev. Mr. Bourne is quite widely known\nas an evangelist, and during the past twenty-five years he has carried on his\nreligious work in various parts of the United States. For some years, it is\nsaid, he has been subject to attacks of a peculiar kind, which rendered him\ntemporarily insensible, and on some occasions he has remained in an\nunconscious state for many hours. He came originally from the West, and\na fellow citizen, whose deprivations of speech and hearing had elicited sympathy and\nregret. )\nMr. Bourne is a sensible and intelligent man, and views his own case in a rational\nand Christian-like manner.\nOn conversation with him, since Sunday last, at which time his hearing and\nspeech were restored, I find that there is no desire on his part to encourage the\nabsurd opinion that he has been the subject of a miracle, but that he attributes his\nrecovery, by the blessing of God Almighty, the author and giver of every good and\nperfect gift, to the means and measures adopted by his physician.\nI am, sir, very respectfully yours,\nWilliam Torrey Thurston, M.D.\nThe following is an abridgment of a reply by the Rev. A. C. Comings to Dr.\nThurston's letter :\u2014,\nDr. Thurston admits that such a case was known at Westerly, R.I., on the 28th\nday of October, 1857, as that a man, whose name was Ansel Bourne, suddenly became\ndeaf, dumb, and blind ; that for seven years, as a citizen, he had enjoyed the respect of\nhis fellow citizens ; that the physician called to him found him in such a condition\nthat he judged him to be \" perfectly insensible \" ; that his eyes were insensible to\nlight ; that two days after the physician was first called to Mr. Bourne he found his\nsight \" evidently perfect \" ; that Mr. Bourne's powers of speech and hearing were\nrestored, without the doctor's being present, on Sunday, November 15th, although he\nassumes to know that it was not sudden, which Mr. Bourne affirms was sudden and\ninstantaneous, and to which hundreds also were witnesses ; that Dr. Thurston con\nversed with Mr. Bourne, who then only attributed his recovery to the blessing of\nGod Almighty, and his physician. Mr. Bourne says that at that time he hesitated, not\n\f230 R. Hodgson.\nafter these attacks he sometimes expressed an intention of returning to his\nnative State, and some of his friends think he may have started for the\nWest. Rev. Mr. Bourne was 60 years of age, and had grey head and long\ngrey beard. He was dressed in dark-coloured clothes, wore a brown and\nblue neck-scarf and Derby hat. He was in Providence on Monday, but he\ndid not return to his home, and he has not been heard of since.\nNotwithstanding, however, as I have already said, the publicity\ngiven to the fact of his disappearance, no tidings whatever were\nreceived of him till March 14th, eight weeks later. The account of\nthe morning of March 14th, as given to us by Mr. Bourne in reply to\nour inquiries, agrees substantially with that given to Dr. Weir Mitchell\n(who has taken much interest in the case and has kindly allowed us to\nuse his notes in the preparation of this paper) a year ago by Mr. Bourne,\nand with that furnished to Dr. Weir Mitchell by Surgeon-General L. H.\nRead, who was summoned to examine Mr. Bourne on the morning of\nMarch 14th, soon after he regained his ordinary waking consciousness.\nThe contemporary newspaper accounts which we have seen are also in\nsubstantial agreement with the results of our recent inquiries.\nIt appears that Ansel Bourne arrived at Norristown, Pa., about\nFebruary 1st, 1887, i.e., two weeks after his disappearance from Provi\ndence, R.I. Under the name of A. J. Brown he rented a store-room at\n252, East Main-street, from Mr. Pinkston Earle, and divided the room\ninto two by means of curtains. The rear portion of the room he filled\nwith furniture and used as a \" general living \" apartment, not only\ndesiring to attribute to the miraculous power of God what could by any possibility be\naccounted for upon natural principles, and he was slow to assume that he had been\nthe subject of miraculous power. But his doubts upon that subject have since been\ntaken away.\nIn the letter of Dr. Thurston are distinct errors which Mr. Bourne would correct,\nnot wishing, however, to charge the Doctor with intentional falsehood, or intentional\nmisrepresentation ; but only as trying, \" if possible, to do away with the notion that\nthere was anything marvellous or miraculous in the case.\"\nMr. Bourne has the kindest feelings toward Dr. Thurston, and, as a physician,\nhas confidence in him. But in relation to the subject now in question he must speak\nthe truth :\u2014\n1. The Doctor says that, on the 28th of October, he found Mr. Bourne \" perfectly\ninsensible.\" To the Doctor this doubtless appeared so. But, although he was helpless,\nhe was perfectly sensible of all around him, which, deprived of his powers, he could\nrecognise. His thoughts were free and unrestrained.\n2. Doctor Thurston says that \" the loss of his hearing and speech was owing to a\nparalysis of the motor nerve of the tongue, known as the hypoglossal nerve, and of the\nauditory nerve.\" Had this been so he could not have used his tongue at will, for any\nthing. But he had a free use of his tongue for everything but to speak with.\n3. Dr. T. says\u2014speaking of the medical treatment of the case : \" The legitimate\nresult of the treatment was recovery, it was not sudden nor unexpected.\" The answer\nto this must be plain and simple. The recovery took place in the presence of several\nhundred persons, and was as sudden as thought. It was at a moment, and in a place\nwhen and where several hundreds of persons all had their eyes fixed directly upon\nhim, and witnessed the immediate proofs of the fact.\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 231\nsleeping there, but preparing his own meals there also. The front por\ntion of the room he stocked with notions, toys, confectionery, &c. These\nhe purchased and paid for in Philadelphia, which he visited each week\nfor the purpose of replenishing his stock. He fastened a sign to his\nwindow, reading A. J. Brown. The room which he rented was part of\nthe house in which the Earle family were dwelling, but although they\ncame in daily contact with \" Mr. Brown \" there was nothing in his\nmanner or proceedings which suggested anything peculiar. He was quiet\nin his behaviour, precise and regular in his habits, and paid his bills\npromptly. He was especially punctual in the closing of his store at\n9 p.m. on ordinary week-days, and at 10 p.m. on Saturday. He\nattended the Methodist church on Sunday, and on one occasion, at a\nreligious meeting, he related an incident which he said he had witnessed\non a steamboat years previously on the passage from Albany to New\nYork, and his remarks were thought particularly relevant to the point\nunder consideration. In short, none of the persons who had any deal\nings with him seem to have conceived any suspicion that he was in any\nunusual condition or labouring under any form of vagary.\nOn the morning of Monday, March 14th, about five o'clock, he\nheard, he says, an explosion like the report of a gun or a pistol, and,\nwaking, he noticed that there was a ridge in his bed not like the bed\nhe had been accustomed to sleep in. He noticed the electric light\nopposite his windows. He rose and pulled away the curtains and\nlooked out on the street. He felt very weak, and thought that he had\nbeen drugged. His next sensation was that of fear, knowing that he\nwas in a place where he had no business to be. He feared arrest as a\nburglar, or possibly injury. He says this is the only time in his life\nhe ever feared a policeman.\nThe last thing he could remember before waking was seeing the\nAdams express waggons at the corner of Dorrance and Broad Streets, in\nProvidence, on his way from the store of his nephew in Broad-street to\nhis sister's residence in Westminster-street, on January 17th.\nHe waited to hear someone move, and for two hours he suffered\ngreat mental distress. Finally he tried the door, and finding it fastened\non the inside, opened it. Hearing someone moving in another room he\nrapped at the door. Mr. Earle opened it, and said, \"Good morning, Mr.\nBrown.\" Mr. B.: \"Where am I?\" Mr. E.: \"You're all right.\" Mr. B.:\n\" I'm all wrong. My name isn't Brown. Where am 11\" Mr. E. :\n\" Norristown.\" Mr. B.: \"Where is that?\" Mr. E.: \"In Pennsylvania.\"\nMr. B.: \"What part of the country?\" Mr. E.: \"About 17 miles west of\nPhiladelphia.\" Mr. B.: \"What time in the month is it?\" Mr. E.: \"The\n14th.\" Mr. B. : \"Does time run backwards here? When I left home it\nwas the 17th.\" Mr. E. : \"17th of what?\" Mr. B.: \"17th of January.\"\nMr. E. : \" It's the 14th of March.\"\n\f232 R. Hodgson.\nMr. Earle thought that \"Mr. Brown\" was out of his mind, and said\nthat he would send for a doctor. He summoned Dr. Louis H. Read,\nto whom Mr. Bourne told the story of his doings in Rhode Island on\nthe morning of January 17th, and said that he remembered nothing\nbetween the time of seeing the Adams express waggons on Dorrance-\nstreet, on January 17th, and waking up that morning, March 14th.\n\" These persons,\" he said, \" tell me I am in Norristown, Pennsylvania,\nand that I have been here for six weeks, and that I have lived with\nthem all that time. I have no recollection of ever having seen one of\nthem before this morning.\" He requested Dr. Read to telegraph to his\nnephew, Andrew Harris, then at 121, Broad-street, Providence, R.I.\nDr. Read telegraphed, \" Do -you know Ansel Bourne 1 Please answer.\"\nThe reply came, \" He is my uncle. Wire me where he is, and if well.\nWrite particulars.\"\nLater, Mr. Harris journeyed to Norristown, sold the goods in the\nstore by auction, and settled up the business affairs of \" Mr. Brown,\"\nwho, as Mr. Bourne, returned with him to Rhode Island. Dr. Read\nadds, in his account of the case which he furnished to Dr. Weir\nMitchell :\u2014\n\" He said he was a preacher and farmer, and could not conceive why\nhe should have engaged in a business he knew nothing about, and never\nhad any desire to engage in it. When asked about his purchasing and\npaying for goods, and paying freight bills, he said he had no recollec\ntion of any such transactions.\n\"The family with whom he lived say that after the occurrence of that\nmorning he was greatly changed. He was annoyed at any reference to\nhis store, and never entered it afterward. He became despondent, took\nno food, was unable to sleep, and became greatly prostrated both\nphysically and mentally, and from information recently received, those\nconditions are said to continue.\n\" There are a number of circumstances connected with and pre\nceding the peculiar dual condition that have satisfied me that he is a\nsincere man, and not an impostor.\"\nEarly in 1890 Professor James heard of the case from one of our\nAssociates, Mr. J. N. Arnold, who was the means of putting him\ninto communication with Mr. Harris and Mr. Bourne, and for whose\nassistance in this and in other cases we are much indebted.\nIt will have been observed that no account was forthcoming of Mr.\nBourne's doings between the time of his disappearance from Providence\nand his advent in Norristown two weeks later, and Professor James\nconceived the idea that if Mr. Bourne could be hypnotised we might\nobtain from him while in the hypnotic trance a complete history of the\nwhole incident, and at the same time, by post-hypnotic suggestion,\nprevent the recurrence of any such episode. The circumstances had\n4T-\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 233\nnaturally left a painful and perplexed impression upon Mr. Bourne ;\nhe was anxious to have any light possible thrown upon his strange\nexperience, and he readily acquiesced in the proposals made for\nhypnotisation.\nMr. Bourne is still living in Greene, R.I., and in accordance with\nour arrangement 1 he came to Boston on five consecutive days, May\n27th to 31st, and submitted to our investigations, returning each day to\nGreene. Professor James and myself also visited Mr. Bourne and\nhypnotised him in his home at Greene, R.I., on June 7th, 1890.\nOn May 27th, we questioned him in detail concerning his past life,\nand ascertained, inter alia, that he was \"mesmerised\" once, about forty\nyears previously; he thinks that he was not \"transformed\" into anyone\nelse by the \" mesmerist,\" but was made to go through various laugh\nable performances. At 1.50. p.m. Professor James began to hypnotise\nhim\u2014using passes \u2014 and he proved a sensitive subject, becoming\nentranced in the course of a few minutes. He was unable to open his\neyes, to unclasp his hands, &c. No inquiry was made on this occasion\nconcerning the \"Brown\" incident; we determined simply that he\ncould be readily entranced and readily waked.\nOn the next day we endeavoured to obtain a detailed account from\nhim, while in the trance state, of his doings during the eight weeks,\nJanuary 17th to March 13th, 1887. The following statements2 were\nelicited from him after he had been enjoined to go into a deeper\nsleep and recall everything that happened on January 17th, .1887,\nand afterwards.\nHe said that his name was Albert John Brown, that on January\n17th, 1887, he went from Providence to Pawtucket in a horse-car,\nthence by train to Boston, and thence to New York, where he arrived\nat 9 p.m., and went to the Grand Union Hotel, registering as A. J.\nBrown. He left New York on the following morning and went to\nNewark, N. J., thence to Philadelphia, where he arrived in the evening,\nand stayed for three or four days in a hotel near the Depot. He then\nspent a week or so in a boarding-house in Filbert-street, about No.\n1,115, near the Depot. It was kept by two ladies, but he could not\nremember their names. He thought of taking a store in a small town,\nand after looking round at several places, among them Germantown,\nchose Norristown, about twenty miles from Philadelphia, where he\nstarted a little business of 5 cent goods, confectionery, stationery, &c.\n1 Mr. Bourne received his travelling expenses, and in addition the amount which\nhe would have earned by his ordinary work as carpenter. He arrived in Boston about\n11 a.m. and left at 3 p.m.\n2 1 here give a general summary of the various statements made by Mr. Bourne\nin trance at our different sittings. The more detailed account of these is given in\nAppendix A.\n\f234 R. Hodgson.\nHe stated that he was born in Newton, New Hampshire, July 8th,\n1826 (he was born in New York city, July 8th, 1826), had passed\nthrough a great deal of trouble, losses of friends and property ; loss\nof his wife was one trouble\u2014she died in 1881 ; three children living,\n\u2014but everything was confused prior to his finding himself in the horse-\ncar on the way to Pawtucket ; he wanted to get away somewhere\u2014he\ndidn't know where\u2014and have rest. He had six or seven hundred\ndollars with him when he went into the store. He lived very closely,\nboarded by himself, and did his own cooking. He went to church, and\nalso to one prayer meeting. At one of these meetings he spoke about\na boy who had kneeled down and prayed in the midst of the passengers\non a steamboat from Albany to New York.\nHe had heard of the singular experience of Ansel Bourne, but did\nnot know whether he had ever met Ansel Bourne or not. He had been\na professor of religion himself for many years, belonged to the\n\" Christian \" denomination, but back there everything was mixed up.\nHe used to keep a store in Newton, New Hampshire, and was engaged\nin lumber and trading business ; had never previously dealt in the\nbusiness which he took up at Norristown. He kept the Norristown\nstore for six or eight weeks\u2014how he got away from there was all\nconfused ; since then it has been a blank. The last thing he remembered\nabout the store was going to bed on Sunday night, March 13th, 1887.\nHe went to the Methodist church in the morning, walked out in the\nafternoon, stayed in his room in the evening and read a book. He did\nnot feel \" anything out of the way.\" Went to bed at eight or nine\no'clock, and remembered being in bed, but nothing further.\nThe statements made by Mr. Bourne in trance concerning his doings\nin Norristown agree with those made by his landlord there and other\npersons, but since Mr. Bourne, in his normal state, has heard of these,\nthey afforded no presumption in favour of the correctness of his state\nments concerning the first two weeks of his absence, those which\nimmediately preceded his arrival in Norristown. The register books\nof the hotels had been destroyed, so that we were unable to trace his\ntravels in detail by finding the name \"A. J. Brown \" at the hotels\nwhich he described himself as having visited. We have, however,\nthrough the kindness of Mr. William Romaine Newbold, Lecturer on\nPsychology in the University of Pennsylvania, ascertained that he\nboarded for a week or more at \" The Kellogg House,\" Nos. 1,605-7,\nFilbert-street, Philadelphia. Mr. Newbold's report (see Appendix B)\nseems to establish the general trustworthiness of Mr. Bourne's account\n(in trance) of his doings before going to Norristown, although his\nrecollections may be inaccurate as regards such minor points as the\nnumber of the boarding-house, &c.\nMr. Newbold thinks \" the reason that Bourne found his way into\n\fA Case of Doiible Consciousness. 235\n' The Kellogg House ' is to be found in the fact that it is the first house\nin Filbert-street going west from the Pennsylvania R.R. Depot that\ndisplays a sign such as would be likely to attract a man of moderate\nmeans but staid habits. Indeed, I believe that it is the first house in\nthat direction that has any sign at all, and the hotels directly in view\nupon coming out of the station all have the general appearance of the\nordinary saloon. 'The Kellogg House' is plain and respectable in\nappearance.\"\nIt may be worth mentioning here that the Grand Union Hotel,\nwhere Mr. Bourne in trance states that he stayed in New York, is just\nacross the street from the station, and that, as we learn from Mrs.\nBourne, he had stayed there on his honeymoon trip with her in\nSeptember, 1882, and had previously been there with his sisters.\nAdditional corroboration of the accuracy of his trance-memory has\nbeen furnished by statements which Mr. Bourne (in trance) made\nconcerning the money and other property in his possession at Norris-\ntown on the night of the 13th of March, 1887. We have satisfactory\nreasons for regarding these statements as correct, but the details of the\ncircumstances connected with their verification involve matters which\nwe do not feel justified in publishing. It is enough to say that the\nmoney which he took away on January 17th has been, in our opinion,\naccounted for, though, prior to our inquiries made in consequence of\nhis trance-statements, there was an unexplained deficiency of about\n$150.00.\nIt will be seen from the account which Mr. Newbold obtained of the\nconversations which \"Mr. Brown\" had with Mrs. Kellogg and the waiter,\nMr. Jackson, that Mr. Bourne in his secondary state recollected certain\nportions of his past life, and especially the character of his own trade.\nHis memory seems to have been considerably better during his eight\nweeks' spontaneous \"ambulatory trance\" than it is now in the artificially\nproduced trance, and it may be worth while adding that it appeared\nto be, as regards some details of his entire life, more obscure in our\nlatest hypnotisations than in our earliest. Many of our questions were\nrepeated again and again, and we have not recorded all these in full\ndetail, but the result suggests that the \"Brown\" state is much less\ncoherent now than in its first inception in 1887, and that the personality\nof \" Brown \" is slowly disintegrating.\nFrom the tests of the sense organs made upon Mr. Bourne, both\nwaking and entranced, it would seem that the only difference between\ntrance and waking as to sensibility is \" a not very pronounced analgesia\nduring the trance.\" (See Appendix C, p. 255.)\nWe made attempts while Mr. Bourne was in his normal state to\nevoke the \"Brown\" personality by automatic writing, <tc, and similarly,\nwhile he was entranced, we endeavoured to \" tap \" Mr. Bourne, but\n\f230 R. Hodgson.\nour efforts were unavailing. So, likewise, were the attempts, by\nprolonged passes, to produce a deeper trance in which the \" Bourne \"\nand \" Brown \" personalities might be unified. We could get no\nmanifestation of either personality while the other was to the front,\nnot even the fulfilment of post-hypnotic suggestions, and at the end\nof our experiments Brown and Bourne seemed as far as ever from\nrealising that each belonged to the other.\nTaken altogether, the case is not a little perplexing. In the Brown\nstate, while forgetting some of the most important events of his past\nlife, including his own name and his second marriage, and the place of\nhis birth, he remembered the date of his birth correctly, the date of his\nfirst wife's death, his trade, &c, and curiously enough, on one occasion\nrelated an incident that occurred on a steamboat between Albany and\nNew York, and which in his Bourne state he also well remembers. In\ntrance, on May 28th, he recalled that he had children living, but on\nJune 7th he had no recollection of them. It is difficult to see along\nwhat definite channels the temporary obliteration of Bourne's memories\nproceeded, with, as consequence, his transformation into Brown. We\nlearn from Mr. Bourne that he never knew a Mr. A. J. Brown, and\nnever lived in Newton, N. H. Neither Mr. Bourne nor his wife\ncould suggest any clue which might lead to any explanation of his\nadopting A. J. Brown as his name, or Newton, N. H., as his birth\nplace.1 But, indeed, we could hardly hope to trace the antecedents\nof his peculiar actions in detail. And it remains now to mention\nsome additional facts which appear to throw some light upon both\nof his remarkable experiences, at least to the extent of suggesting\nthat his case should be classified in its essentials as belonging to a\nwell-recognised type.\nIn reply to our inquiries (see also Dr. Hinsdale's report, Appendix\nC, p. 254), he stated that he injured his eyesight as a young man by\ntoo much study, working at night to educate himself. His vision\nimproved after his strange experience in 1857, and remained improved\nuntil 1887. He used to have headaches frequently, now seldom. They\ndiminished as he began to lose his hair, which was very thick in 1857.\n(Of course the loss of his hair may not have been the cause of the\ndiminution of his headaches.)\nHe stated also that he had been subject to the \" blues \" since child\nhood, but these had not been so frequent for a year and a half. When\nunder them he did not want to see anybody or talk to anybody. These\nwould sometimes last a few hours, sometimes a week. Occasionally,\n1 The postmaster at Newton, N. H., in reply to my inquiry, states that he has\n\"asked some of the oldest inhabitants, and none of them ever knew of any A. J.\nBrown.\"\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 237\nat such times, when walking, he would find himself two or three\nmiles away from where he had last noticed himself as being.\nMrs. Bourne informed us that Mr. Bourne had had several \" faint\ning fits \" in the course of his life. She knew of four such occurrences.\nThe first of these happened about July, 1882, two months before her\nmarriage, in church. Mr. Bourne had gone into the pulpit just before\nthe service. He was not going to preach that day. It was very warm,\nand, as Mr. Bourne was coming out of the pulpit, he fell down uncon\nscious. The second occurred about December, 1882, when he fell off\na lounge in the room. On the third occasion he was standing by the\nside of the carriage after harnessing the horses, when he suddenly fell\nunconscious. This was in February, 1886. The last time occurred soon\nafter his return from Norristown in 1887. He was sitting in a chair\nunder a tree in the shade, and he slid out of the chair to the ground.\nOn these occasions he remained unconscious for several hours, probably\ntwo hours at least and six hours at most.\nThese facts, taken in connection with his experiences in 1857\nand 1887, suggest that Mr. Bourne has been subject to some form\nof epilepsy, and that during his eight weeks' absence in 1887 he\nwas suffering from a post-epileptic partial loss of memory. I suppose\nthat on January 17th, 1887, he may have had a mild epileptic seizure,\nand that \" after the fit, he was a different person, although in the same\nskin ; or, as the popular phrase is, the post-epileptic patient ' was not\nhimself.' \" 1\nIn the Zoxst, that storehouse of valuable material, deeply instructive\neven by the very errors which we now see were made by many of the\nthen upholders of hypnotic treatment, I have found two cases which are\nworth mentioning in this connection. One of these is quoted by Dr.\nElliotson (op. cit, IV., p. 168) from Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach's\ncollection of trials. It is that of a \"poor, innocent, industrious youth,\"\nnamed Sorgel, who was \"subject first to violent epilepsy and then to\nparoxysms of second consciousness, in which his faculties were deranged,\nin which he had delusions and ungovernable criminal propensities, the\nwhole of which he was ignorant of upon returning to his ordinary state\nof consciousness, though in his morbid state he remembered the occur\nrences of his natural state.\" \" In one of his two states, the diseased,\npreternatural one, he was decidedly insane, and at length committed\na murder.\"\n1 The Croonian Lectures on Evolution and Dissolution of the Nervous System, 1884,\nby J. Hughlings Jackson, M.D. See also, by the same author, Ophthalmology and\nDiseases of the Nervous System, 1885, and Temporary Mental Disorders after Epileptic\nParoxysms, in The West Riding Lunatic Asylum Reports, \"Vol. V. The transition of\nFelida X. into her secondary statehas suggested analogy with lepetit mat (Bypnotisme,\nDouble Conscience, et AlUratiom de la JPersonnalite', by Dr. Azam, p. 88).\n\f238 R. Hodgson.\nThe other case is that of a lad named Russon, fifteen or sixteen\nyears of age (op. cit., I., pp. 340-349, and VIII., pp. 237-252), who, after\nan epileptic fit, became deaf, dumb, and blind. Dr. Todd, of the King's\nCollege Hospital, where the boy was taken on the day of his seizure\n(April 2nd, 1843), says :\u2014\n\" The only history we could obtain of him was that he had, about two\no'clock in the morning, walked into a coffee-shop in Drury-lane, where he was\nfound sitting in o\u00bbe of the boxes speechless and insensible. He was handed\nover to the police, by whom he was brought to the hospital. The house\nphysician found him sitting erect on a chair, his eyes widely open and\nmotionless, pupils dilated, and presenting an undulating motion when the\ncandle was placed near them ; conjunctivae rather injected ; countenance\nexpressive of astonishment ; respiration easy, although a little quicker than\nit ought to be ; power of deglutition perfect ; no spasm or twitching of any\nsingle muscle. The most remarkable feature was his utter insensibility to\nevery external impression ; even the roughest treatment produced no effect\nupon him ; the splashing of cold water, shaking, pinching, shouting in his\nears, seemed to make no impression. He had walked into the hospital\nbetween two policemen ; whilst in the surgery of the hospital he never\naltered his position in the slightest degree ; and after having been examined\nin the surgery, he walked upstairs to his ward without dragging his feet,\nbut aided by the policeman.\"\n******\n\" On the second day after his admission (the 4th) he made signs for\npaper, and wrote an account of himself, stating that he had been subject to\nfits, and giving the address of his father, and also giving a history of himself\nduring the day previous to his admission to the hospital. But it was very\nremarkable that in writing he seemed to trust entirely to the guidance of\nhis sense of touch, for during the whole time he was writing he kept his eyes\naverted from the paper, with a fixed gaze directed towards the ceiling, and\nwhen a handkerchief was applied round his eyes it did not interfere with\nhis ability to write. But we could not obtain any satisfactory evidence that\nhe could see, or hear, or smell.\n\"After this he began to ask for food, and ate with the most extraordinary\neagerness, snapping at everything that came in contact with his lips, even\npieces of paper, which he chewed and swallowed. In the afternoon of this\nday he began to see, and amused himself reading and writing, in both of\nwhich he showed himself a proficient.\"\nHe still, however, remained deaf and dumb, and continued so in\nthe hospital nearly three weeks from his admission, after which his\nfather took him to Dr. Elliotson, who writes as follows :\u2014\n\" The account given tome by the father was that the boy lived with\nhim at Twickenham, and supported himself by fetching small periodicals,\nabout twice a week, from London, and distributing them in the neighbour\nhood. Rather more than three weeks previously, on the 1st of April, he\nhad gone as usual to No. 4, Brydges-street, Covent-garden, for books and\nnewspapers, and had to procure four dozen of Lloyd's Weekly London, New-\npaper. He put two dozen upon the counter, two dozen in his handkerchief,\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 239\nwith the books on the top of the latter, intending to put the two dozen\nwhich were upon the counter on the top of the books, and tie all up together ;\nbut he forgot those on the counter, and tied up only the books and the\nLloyd's which were in the handkerchief. On arriving at home he found\nonly the two dozen of the Lloyd's, and was terrified at the idea of his\nfather's anger. His father returned home at eight, accused him of being\ndrunk, being himself by no means a teetotaller, and of having spent the\nmoney in liquor. The boy protested he had tasted only water and tea the\nwhole day. They walked to Richmond, and the boy got on an omnibus\nto go to London, hoping to find his Lloyd's where he had left them. He\nremembers nothing more after this than that he one day ' awoke as from a\ndeep sleep, in a strange place ; began looking around him, tried in vain to\nspeak, and could not hear any noise at all. Seeing a board over the fireplace\nwith the words King's College Hospital upon it, he learnt where he was.'\nThe father ascertained that when he returned to the newspaper office his\npapers had been carried off by someone, and no more were to be had till the\nnext day ; that he had gone to a neighbouring coffee-house, been seized with\na most violent epileptic fit, and carried by the police to King's College\nHospital, where he lay perfectly insensible for four days and five nights.\"\nIt was subsequently ascertained that he had had three epileptic fits\nat about a year's interval within the previous four years. Dr. Elliotson\n\" mesmerised \" him daily for about four weeks, at the end of which\ntime (on May 25th), on awaking from trance, it was found that he\nhad recovered his hearing. Dr. Elliotson immediately entranced him\nagain, and after a short time he made efforts to speak, finally succeeded,\nand woke \" in the midst of the efforts.\" He was then apparently per\nfectly cured, and was taken into the household service of Mr. H. S.\nThompson, of Yorkshire, who had witnessed the cure. Three months\nlater, August 24th, the boy had another seizure, concerning which\nMr. Thompson wrote to Dr. Elliotson as follows :\u2014\n\" You will be sorry to hear of our reverses. Thomas is again deaf and\ndumb. Yesterday he was waiting at dinner, and the conversation turned\nupon the effect music had upon insanity ; from that, I know not how, some\nof the party began to compare the ills that flesh is heir to : deafness and\ndumbness and loss of sight were mentioned among the rest, which produced\nsuch a sudden excitement in the lad that he just got out of the room and\nwent into a fit. I immediately went and mesmerised him. In half an hour\nhe came to his senses and made signs that he would write, and that he\ncould not speak, or hear, or see. I mesmerised his eyes, when he opened\nthem, but the pupil was dilated and they appeared to be quite insensible to\nlight. I mesmerised him again, and he then got the use of his eyes, but he\nstill continued deaf and dumb. I have not mesmerised him for some time\nlately, and I imagined the boy was quite well, but now they tell me that he\nhas been very odd the last day or two, walking about with his arms folded,\nand that they thought his hearing was not quite so good. All this is\nremembered now. I shall persevere in mesmerising him regularly, and hope\nit will not last long. He is dreadfully low.\"\n\f240 R. Hodgson.\nOn the same date, August 25th, the boy wrote, in a communication to\nMrs. Thompson :\u2014\n\" I was not listening to you to hear what you were talking about, but I\nheard you say deaf and dumb, and when you said it, it shook me all right\nthrough me, and then I heard Mr. Thompson say blind, and then it shook me\nagain the same with a most thrilling pain right through me, and I felt myself\ntrembling and I tried to get out of the room, but I do not know that I did\nget out of the room, and I remembered no more till I found myself in bed,\nand I tried to open my eyes and speak, but I could not, nor I could not hear\nany noise, but I felt someone mesmerising me, as I thought ; and then I\nwanted to go out and they would not let me go at first, but they let me go\nafterwards into the pantry, and then I wrote and told you what I felt and\nhow I was ; but I hope you will pardon me for taking this liberty to write to\nyou.\"\nOn August 29th, Mr. Thompson announced his recovery to Dr. Elliot-\nson in the following letter :\u2014,\n\"August 29th. I cannot help writing you a line to-night, as I am certain\nyou will be glad to hear the lad has recovered his hearing and speech ; to-day\nI mesmerised him still more, and dropped mesmerised water into his ears.\nHe wrote that he heard a roaring like a waterfall, and a sensation as if I\nthrust a hot iron into his ear. However, though I continued to mesmerise\nhim for an hour and a half, there was no symptom of his recovering. After\nhe left me the sensation of heat increased, and he began to feel acute pain\nin his ears and back of his head, and he came to me in hopes I should be\nable to relieve him. I mesmerised him, and he was so violent that another\nman and myself could scarcely hold him down. . . . He at last fell\ninto a quiet state, and after he had remained so a quarter of an hour I blew\nin his face, when he awoke. At first he was not aware that he could either\nhear or speak, and was much astonished to find that he was restored.\"\nThe resemblance between this boy's second experience and that of\nAnsel Bourne in 1857 is very striking. It was doubtless in each\ncase the result essentially of a self-suggestion, and it is perhaps not\naltogether unwarrantable to assume that the cure in both cases would\nhave been a much speedier one had the subject been hypnotised and\ntreated after the \" suggestion \" methods of Professor Bernheim.\nA case of double personality, apparently very similar in some\nrespects to that of Mr. Bourne, was reported by Professor Proust, of\nParis, and published last year in the Revue de VHypnotisme. An\nabridgment of his account is given in Appendix D. ( p. 255). Here,\nalso, the subject in the spontaneously occurring \" secondary state \"\nwandered off for days and weeks at a time, and knew nothing after\nwards of his doings. His memory of them was revived by hypnotism.\nAnother case which I have thought it worth while to place in the\nAppendix (E., p. 256) is entitled by Dr. Trowbridge, who reported it,\n\"A Case of Epilepsy with Double Consciousness.\"\nWhether Mr. Bourne's case is an instance of \" epilepsy \" \u2014\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 241\n\" masked epilepsy \"\u2014or not, it suggests a group of \" states \" which are\nworthy of the most profound comparative study, viz., sleep, hypnosis,\nnarcosis, and post-epileptic mental disturbance, in connection with the\nlast of which I need hardly indicate the possibly great importance of\n\"suggestive therapeutics.\"\nAPPENDIX A.\nDetailed Account of Sittings, &o.\nMay 28f\/i.

Sensibility of back of head and\nfingers seems unnaturally small. Thighs tested : the left thigh when awake (he\nsays) is ' ' numb \" from having had a beam fall on it. He feels and recognises\npin pricks on right thigh now ; on left thigh he first calls them \" touches \"\u2014\nthen \"pins.\" No change apparent from waking state. Pupils contract well\nto light.\nW. J. sits quietly talking with him and making suggestions about his\nhead feeling well and clear and his mind cheerful and young when he goes\naway from here. J. has told him before that ho was in Hodgson's room in\nBoston. He now suddenly says, \"Do you say this is Boston ? \" \"Yes,\nMr. Hodgson's room, 5, Boylston-place.\" B. : \"Where do you live?\"\nJ.: \"Cambridge.\" B. :\" Cambridge 1 Isn't that the place where Parker\u2014\nParkman ?\u2014was murdered ? \" J. : \"Yes, Webster and Parkman. Where\nwere you at that time ? \" B. : \" Oh ! I don't seem to know\u2014Rhode Island,\nperhaps.\"\nAt about 12.35 Hodgson brings in dinner and \"Brown\" eats with\napparent gbod appetite roast beef, potatoes, omelet, and so forth, but still\nwith a dejected manner. Asked whether he would like some wine or beer,\nhe replies that he never touches liquor. Whilst eating, Hodgson asks again\nif he made any money by his store. He turns to James quickly and asks :\n\"What became of that store, any way?\" J.: \"It is let to someone\nelse.\" B. : \" I haven't been settled with. I don't seem to get right about\nwhat became of that store. There's something back there.\" J. : \"Don't\ntry to remember.\" B. : \"It troubles me.\" And he sits after dinner with\nhead in hand, \"trying to think up.\"\n12.58 p.m. J. seats him in the arm-chair again and makes passes over\nhim for three-quarters of an hour. After waiting five minutes longer J. asks\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 245\nhim how he felt. B : \" Been asleep. . . . Feel calm. . . . Wish\nI could get out of this\u2014get out one way or the other\u2014see something some\nwhere.\" J. : \" Do you feel perplexed?\" B. : \"I'm hedged in either way,\ncan't get back and go-ahead. \" J. : \" Still troubling yourself ? \" B. : \"Yes.\nI can't help it.\" J. : \"Did you feel the same as this while you kept the\nstore?\" B. : \"I wasn't cheerful. . . . What troubles me now is how I\ngot at Dorrance-street and what came of the store.\" J. : \" But while there,\nwere you troubled like this 1\" B. : \"No.\"\nJ. gives him post-hypnotic suggestion, viz., to write details of leaving\nProvidence, &c. , after being waked up.\nJ. asks if he remembers being mesmerised many years ago. He says\nthat he doesn't remember anything about it.\nJ. wakes him at 2.5. p.m., after enjoining freedom from perplexity on\nwaking up, &c. He looks at his watch and is surprised at the time. J. :\n\" Do you feel hungry ? \" B. : \"No. I don't feel so hungry as I did when\nI come.\"\nPencil and block-book are placed in his hands on the table. We talk\nwith him. He tells us that he is not a nervous or excitable man in any\nway, not afraid of anybody. \"There's plenty of men can whip me, but\nI'd tell them what I think and be cool about it, and not be afraid of\nthem.\"\nNo writing. (Post-hypnotic suggestion not fulfilled.)\nFriday, May 30th, 1890. Present, William James, M.D., Edward\nCowles, M.D., and William Noyes, M.D. Hypnotised by W. J., at 12.6\np.m. Six passes made, and subject is in a deep sleep.\nW. J. : \"What's your name now?\" Long hesitation and no answer.\nW. J. : \" You can't open your eyes. What's your name ? \" A. B. :\n\"Brown.\" W. J. : \"You were Brown yesterday. You are not yet Brown. \"\nMakes many passes up and down. \"Let go of Brown. Haven't come to\nBrown yet. Now what's your name?\" A. B. : \"It is mixed up now.\"\nW. J. : \"You are no longer Brown. Now who are you?\" No answer.\nW. J. : \"Now give me your name.\" A. B. : \"Got two or three names, I\nguess.\" (More passes.) W. J. : \"Give me some of the names, not all of\nthem.\" No answer. (More passes.) W. J. : \" Now what's your name ? \"\nSubject sighs.\n12.10 p.m. W. J. : \"What are you thinking about? What's your\nright name now?\" A. B. : \"Brown, haven't got any other name.\" W. J. :\n\"I will count eight, and I want yon to wake up at the word six. One,\u2014\ntwo,\u2014three,\u2014four,\u2014five \" Subject rubs his eyes, and leans forward on\nright hand.\nW. J. : \"You are Ansel Bourne?\" A. B. (awake): \"Yes.\" W.J. :\n\"Shut your eyes and continue Ansel Bourne. You are not Brown yet.\"\nA. B. (eyes shut\u2014hypnotised) : \"No.\" W. J. : \"You are going to be\nBrown by-and-by. I want you to do something for me. I will give you a\npad and pencil, and you will write something down on paper. You'll talk, and\nthe talking won't interfere. What's your name now?\" A. B. : \"Mixed\nup.\" (Makes no attempt to write on paper.) W. J. : \"Do you remember\nour talk? \" A. B. : \"Yes. Where am I now?\" W. J. : \"In Mr. Hodgson's\n\f246 R.

B. : \"Something I have been\ntrying to get out for a long time\u2014where I am and where I am going to. \"\nE.C. : \"Where are you?\" A. B. : \"He says I am in Boston.\" W. J. :\n\" Tell us where you went after you left home.\" (All his replies to this ques\ntion were not taken down, as W. J. stated that they were the same as given\nyesterday.) A. B. : \"Can't tell the name of the hotel in Philadelphia. It\nwas a small hotel opposite the City Hall.\" W. J. : \" What was your wife's\nmaiden name ? \" A. B. : \"Wish I could remember things, but I can't.\"\nW. J. : \" Did you ever have any other wife ? \" A. B. : \"Everything is all\nmixed up. Have been here right along. Terribly mixed up mess. Would\nlike to get at something or other.\"\nW. J. : \" How did you come to pick out Norristown ? Did you go to\nother places?\" A. B. : \"Yes, several other places. Saw in a paper a\nnotice of a store to let. Was an empty store. What has become of that\nstore, and where did I stop ? I went to Germantown to look round. Wanted\nto do something. Thought I might want to locate.\" W. J. : \"How did\nyou find out how to stock your store?\" A. B. : \" Made inquiries. Saw\nadvertisements and displays of goods.\"\n12.22 p.m. W. J. : \"Did you make any acquaintances? What were\nthe names of some of your friends there 1\" A. B. : \" Read was the name\nof one man in Norristown. Made no other acquaintances.\" W. J. : \" What\nchurch did you go to 1 What was the pastor's name ? \" A. B. : \" Went to\nMethodist church. Pastor's name forgotten.\" W. J. : \"What was the state\nof your mind? What did you read ? \" A. B. : \" Read the papers. Don't\nremember reading books.\" W. J. : \" How did you get your store stocked? \"\nA. B. : \" Went to a dozen places to get it stocked. Kept candies, con\nfectionery, nuts, and 5 cent articles.\"\nMay 31st. Present, Professor William James, R. Hodgson, and Dr.\nMorton Prince.\nWhile H. is talking to Bourne, not yet entranced, J., sitting close by\nBourne's side, addresses him as Brown and tells him to lift his hand if he\nhears him. Bourne hears and repeats some of the words, the \"Brown\"\nconsciousness apparently not being reached.\nJ. tells Bourne that after he gets into the hypnotic sleep he will write\nwhat he did during the time he was away from home as Brown. He is then,\nabout 11.15 a.m., hypnotised into the Brown state, and pencil and block-book\nare put into his hand. After about 10 minutes' waiting, J. asked if he didn't\nfeel like writing ? B. : \"I've nothing to write about.\"\nJ. gives him the suggestion : \"When H. blows his nose and coughs, you\nmust say that he ought to close the window and not have a draught.\" He\nis then waked up.\nNote.\u2014When B. is waked up by being told to count 8 and wake up when\nhe has counted 6\u2014he does not count beyond 6. The suggestion seems thus\nnot to continue into the waking state.\nIn a few minutes H. blows his nose and coughs. Bourne takes no notice.\n(Post-hypnotic suggestion not fulfilled.)\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness, 247\n11.45 a.m. Hodgson entrances him. In a couple of minutes says,\n\" What's your name ? It's Bourne, isn't it ? \" \" No ! it's Brown.\" Wakes\nhim up again. Da capo : he is Brown at the first touch of trance.\nJ. entrances him\u2014into Brown state\u2014and asks him about his store in\nNorristown. J. : \"Have you got any gum-drops?\" B. : \"Out of gum-drops\nnow.\" J. : \" What do you sell most of ? \" B. : \" I sell most of toffee.\"\nJ. tells him to open his eyes and stand up, and asks for a quarter-pound\nof toffee. He says, \"Where is it ?\" J. gives him a piece of stone, and tells\nhim that it is toffee. He asks for scales. A book is shown to him. He\nsays, \" That's not scales. \" A pair of scales for weighing letters and books\nis pointed out to him, and he seems partially satisfied. But he refuses to\naccept stone as candy, or as maple sugar; says, \"Someone's been here.\nThings are all mixed up.\" He describes a bag, hat, &c, on table correctly,\nwhen asked what they are.\nJ. asks about the landlord of the store. \"Mr. Read is landlord.\"\nJ. tells him it is time to go to bed, and asks him what he feels like doing.\n'' Like going to bed.\" In reply to questions, says that he eats sometimes\nonce, sometimes twice a day\u2014didn't have appetite for more. . . . Made\ntwo or three dollars a day by the store. He purchased from a firm in\nMarket-street. J. : \" What made you take up this business 1 \" B. : \" That\nI can't tell you.\" J. says: \"You're not in the store, you're back here\nin Mr. Hodgson's room. What's the last thing you remember about that\nstore ? \" B. replies : Going to bed\u2014Sunday night\u2014had been to Methodist\nchurch in the morning. Walked out in the afternoon ; stayed in his room\nin evening\u2014read a book he had there. Took a meal after meeting. \"Don't\nknow as I felt anything out of the way.\" Went to bed at 8 or 9 o'clock;\nremembers being in bed. \"That's the last thing I do remember.\"\n(The next experiment was made for the purpose of determining if he would\nspontaneously wake as Bourne after the suggestion that he was in bed in his\nstore on the night of March 13th.) J. : \"We took you out of your bed and\nbrought you here. Now you're back in your bed again, you'll have a good\nsleep, and then you'll go on the right way. . . . It's getting on towards\nmorning. Time to wake up pretty soon. \" Dr. Prince says, after about five\nminutes, when B. 's eyes are open: \"Are you waking up? It's the last\nmorning. Are you going to get up ? \" Two or three minutes later J. asks\nwhat he is thinking of. He still calls himself Brown, and is perplexed\nabout the store.\nHe is told again that he is asleep in his store on the night of March 13th.\nAn explosion is produced by a small powder-cap near his ear. No result.\nOn being questioned, he still maintains that he is Brown.\nJ. wakes him by upward passes without injunction ; then asks him about\nthe process of waking. He says that he woke \"slowly,\" and on being\nquestioned says that he prefers waking quickly.\nJ. then hypnotises him again, and tells him to wake up when he counts\nup to 6, and that he is to keep on counting up to 8. He fulfils this\ninjunction (but he may not have been fully awake till he counted 8).\nJune 7th, 1890. We visited Ansel Bourne at his home in Greene, R.I.,\narriving about 10.10 a.m.\n\f248 R. Hodgson.\nMrs. Bourne stated that Mr. Bourne had taken two bank-books of his\nchildren away with him, on January 17th, 1887, after drawing some of the\nmoney, but had brought the books back in his pocket just as they were when\nhe took them away. . . .\nAbout 10.45 a.m. A. B. hypnotised by W. James. J. : \"What is your\nname 1\" B. : \" Brown.\" J. : \"You've seen me before. How long is it\nsince you saw ms ? \" B. : \" A few minutes.\"\nJ. tells him that he is in Ansel Bourne's house, &c, introduces him to\nMrs. Bourne, and asks him to inform Mrs. B. of his doings since leaving\nProvidence on January 17th, 1887. He gives the same account as before.\nMrs. B. : \" Were you ever to Greene ? \" B. : \"What Greene ? \" Mrs. B. :\n\" Greene in Coventry, R.I.\" B. : \"Never was there.\"\nIn reply to questions, says that he does not remember anything about\nbank-books in Providence Had no money in the bank, and\nmade no presents to anyone. Had somewhere about $600.00 when he got to\nPhiladelphia. Spent most of it in goods and furniture for the store.\nTo the question from whom he hired the store, he replied, \"Prom Read.\"\nAsked if he knew Pinkston Earle : \"I don't know but that was his name \"\n(i.e., the name of the person from whom he hired the store). Said that the\ngoods in the store were worth about $400.00. He had \"no family,\" \"no\nchildren out West..\" .... \" All mixed up. \" Mrs. B. : \" Don't you\nremember the young man out to West Shelby and two children [B. 's grand\nchildren]?\" B. : \"No. Wish I could remember.\" He remembers being\nmarried, and that his wife died many years ago, but nothing more about it.\n[The following experiments were made for the purpose of unifying the\n\" Bourne \" and \" Brown \" consciousnesses\u2014without success.]\nJ. then declares to him that his life and Bourne's are closely connected,\ncarries him back to Norristown, and tells him how he woke up hearing a\nreport like a pistbl and found that he was in a strange bed. That was\nbecause he was in a bed that Ansel Bourne did not know, &c. J. explains to\nhim how he got the money in Providence which he found in his possession\non the Pawtucket horse-car. When asked if he remembers, B. replies, \"Like\na dream.\"\nJ. : \" Now write this : ' I went to sleep in my store on Sunday night.'\nThe next thing you are going to write is : 'I woke and found that I was Ansel\nBourne.' You'll wake when you come to was, but you'll go on writing\n' Ansel Bourne.' \" A. B. writes as suggested, and wakes up after the word\nwas, just as he is starting the \"A\" of \"Ansel.\" He stops writing. J.\ntells him to go on and write Ansel Bourne. He does so, but seems not\nto remember what he wrote before this.\nWe then tell him, in the Bourne state\u2014for the first time\u2014of his revela\ntions concerning the first two weeks after his disappearance from Providence.\nJ. entrances him again, telling him to repeat the following sentence : \"I\ndrew the money from the bank when I was Ansel Bourne, and got into a\nPawtucket horse-car, and became A. J. Brown, and started on the Norris\ntown expedition.\" J. tries to carry his memory continuously along from\nthe Bourne into the Brown state, telling him that he must repeat the\nsentence and that he will pass into the ' ' Brown \" state when he gets to the\nword Pawtucket, and that he will remember what he has been saying just\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 249\nbefore. A. B. passes into the \" Brown \" state at the word Pawtucket, but\ndoes not complete the sentence, and do3s not remember the first part of the\nsentence.\nJ. then suggests to him that he is in the store at Norristown, and tries\nagain the experiment with writing (\"I went to sleep in my store,\" &c.,)\ndescribed above. He wakes as before, and when asked if he remembers\nabout the store, replies, \"Like a dream.\"\nHe is again told to repeat the sentence, \"I drew the money from the\nbank,\" &c, to pass into the \" Brown \" state at the word \" Pawtucket,\" &c.\nHe becomes \" Brown \" duly, but again fails to recall what has preceded.\nB. is then told to repeat orally the words used in the previous writing\nexperiments (\"I went to sleep in my store,\" &c), and to wake up at the\nword iouke and remember the first part of the sentence. He wakes at the\nword suggested, but again fails to recall the first part of the sentence. 12 noon.\n1.45 p.m. Mrs. Bourne takes B.'s right hand in hers, and J. entrances\nB. Brown does not remember Mrs. Bourne.\nJ. wakes B., who is still holding Mrs. B.'s hand, and then tells Mrs. B.\nto put him to sleep. J. tells B. that Mrs. B. will put him to sleep by\ncounting up to 6. She counts, and at \"6\" Bourne passes into \" Brown,\"\nbut again does not know Mrs. Bourne.\nThis experiment repeated again twice, and each time \"Brown\" is\nemphatically told that Mrs. Bourne is his wife, that he is Ansel Bourne,\nthat this is his own house, &c. ; but he seems completely unable to realise it,\nshakes his head when told that Mrs. Bourne is his wife.\n3.10 p.m. He is entranced by R. Hodgson, who tells him before the\ntrance that he will remain Ansel Bourne after being hypnotised. Unavailing.\nHe passes at once into the \"Brown\" state. R. H. then enumerates the chief\nincidents of Bourne's life, telling \"Brown\" that he is \"Bourne\" and that\nhe remembera these events. This is repeated several times, and Mrs. B. and\nW. J. reiterate the same circumstances. \" Brown,\" however, reaches\nnothing more than a faint remembrance of the year of his birth, of the fact\nof his first marriage, and of the death of his first wife.\n3.25 p.m. Hypnotised by W. J., who makes passes for an hour, 3.30\u2014\n4. 30, without any apparent effect in deepening the trance. Further attempts\nto produce a unity of memory between the \" Brown \" and \" Bourne \" states\nunsuccessful.\nWaked at 4.35 p.m.\nJune 7th. Between 1 and 2 p.m. we called upon Mr. Tillinghast\n(retired farmer) and Colonel C. S. Brown (grocer), residents of Greene, who\nstated that Mr. Ansel Bourne had always been highly respected in the com\nmunity as a steady and industrious man. They had no explanation to give\nof his mysterious absence in 1887, though they did not attach any blame to\nMr. Bourne. They had \"heard of such things happening before to people.\"\nThere were a few persons in the village who thought there was \" something\nwrong \" about it, and who in consequence did not respect Mr. Bourne so\nhighly as they had done previously, but the general opinion was that no\n\f250 E. Hodgson.\nblame attached to Mr. Bourne. Previous to the incident Mr. Bourne had\nbeen universally respected.\nAPPENDIX B.\nReport by Mr. Wm. Romaine Newbold.\n(Verification of Mr. Bourne's statements in trance.)\n4,228, Chester-avenue, Philadelphia, Pa., November 22nd, 1890.\nI went to look up that house on Filbert-street on the 20th inst., and\nalthough I wrote out a full account of the matter at the time so as not to\nlose anything by waiting, I have not been able to get the time to write it out\nin a legible form for you to read. I merely copy here what I wrote on\nThursday.\nI inquired at Nos. 1,115, 1,315, 1,509, 1,511, 1,605-7, Filbert-street, and\nfound that the last-named house, \"the Kellogg house,\" Nos. 1,605-7 was\nkept by two sisters, Mrs. Kellogg and Miss Lyon. I saw Mrs. Kellogg,\nlearned that she had been there for about five years ; kept a register now\nbut had only done so recently, and had no account-books, receipted bills, or\nany written paper that could tend to show whether any given person had\nbeen there in the early part of 1887. I then produced the picture. She\nsaid it looked familiar and grew more familiar as she looked at it, but she\ncould not recall where or when she had seen the person it represented.\nAsked the name. I excused myself from mentioning the name for the\npresent, saying that I would like to see whether anyone in the house could\nremember it. I asked for her sister. Her sister was out ; she was very\nsure her sister would not remember him ; their waiter, Franklin Jackson by\nname, would be far more likely to ; she would show him it. Went out and\nsoon returned, saying that Jackson remembered the face perfectly but could\nnot remember the name. She asked the name again. \"A. J. Brown,\" I said.\nShe thought some time but could not recall it at all. I was interested in\nhim, I said, because he had at one time lost consciousness of his own identity,\nand it was believed that he had stayed at their house at the time. She could\nnot remember him.\nI asked to see Jackson. He was very old, she said, and was lying down ;\nstill she would ask him. Presently Jackson appeared. He is a coloured\nman, seventy-two years of age, and seemed very intelligent. Did he re\nmember that man ? Perfectly. How long was he there ? About a week,\nhe thought. Did he remember anything about him ? Very little. He was\nvery quiet ; they thought he was like a minister. Jackson asked his name.\n\"A. J. Brown,\" I said. He suddenly left the room without saying anything ;\nsoon returned, bringing a book filled with names written in pencil. \"I used\nto get the boarders to write their names for me in here,\" he said, \"but he\nisn't here.\" I took the book to look over it myself; as I did so Jackson\nseemed to suddenly recollect something. \" Why, Mrs. Kellogg,\" he said,\n' ' don't you remember that man who stayed, here once and went to Norris-\ntown afterwards and got crazy or something ? Wasn't he named Brown ? \"\nMrs. Kellogg at once remembered that he was. I picked up the picture and\nasked them whether this was the man. Both Mrs. Kellogg and Jackson\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 251\nimmediately identified him with certainty. The greater part of the following\ninformation I got from Jackson, with contributions from Mrs. Kellogg.\nBrown was there about two weeks. Was very quiet ; said little to anyone\nexcept Jackson. Used to sit in the dining-room after supper and talk to\nhim. He said he was a carpenter and came from \" down east somewhere.\"\nHe had told Jackson the name of the town in which he lived, but he could\nonly remember that it was not far from Boston. Jackson was under the\nimpression that he said that he had a \"good bit of money\" ; had a faint\nimpression that he said he had a family. Used to tell Jackson about the\nhouses he had built, of which Jackson could not now remember any. Used\nto say that modem machinery had almost ruined the carpenter's trade. In\nold times, whenever business was dull, the men were kept busy making\nsashes, doors, &c. Now, in such times they were idle ; half of them didn't\nknow how to make a sash. He had in his shop tools for making such things,\nof which half the workmen he employed could not tell the use. He said he\nnever would pay his men on Saturday, but always on Monday. Then they\nhad no chance to go off on sprees, and came to work on Monday sober. He\nsaid he had come to Philadelphia to go into business. Mrs. Kellogg told\nhim there could be no better place than Philadelphia. He said, No, rents\nwere too high. Every day he used to go out and look for a suitable place to\nbegin in. After a while, he came one day and said that he had found just\nthe place for him, and that was Norristown. It was a nice quiet place, and\nhe thought he could build up a good business there. Then he bought\ngoods to take to Norristown\u2014comfortables and tinware were especially\nmentioned, all of which he gave to Jackson to keep while he was out during\nthe day.\nDuring his stay he made no reference to his past life, beyond what I have\ntold, or, at least, none that my informants could recollect. Seemed\nperfectly himself ; never gave any reason for wishing to commence business\nhere.\nThey afterwards saw the accounts in the papers, and recognised the man\nthere referred to as the man who had stayed with them. They were under\nthe impression, however, as I observed while talking with them, that he had\nbecome crazy after leaving them, but it had never occurred to them that there\nhad been anything wrong with him while with them.\nJackson asked Mrs. Kellogg whether she hadn't the book in which she\nused to enter her boarders. She said she supposed she had somewhere, but\ndidn't know where. I asked her whether she wouldn't look it up for me.\nShe said she hadn't an idea as to where it could be, but if ever she ran across\nit she would let me see it.\nI think the above is quite accurate. I took notes of all that was said at\nthe time, and wrote it up within an hour. I have put down all these details\nthat you may form your own opinion as to the worth of their identification.\nI also thought that the rather characteristic remarks attributed by Jackson\nto \"Mr. Brown\" might be of some use to you in determining whether he\nreally was the same A. J. Brown of whom you are in search. I might add\nthat it seemed to me that Mrs. Kellogg and Jackson were giving me real\nreminiscences, and I feel quite sure that they told the truth. I hardly think\nthat it is worth while to see the other sister, Miss Lyon, but, unless you\n\f252 R. Hodgson.\nthink the above enough, I shall go down again in a week or two and try to\nget a sight of that record of Mrs. Kellogg's.\nWm. Romainb Newbold.\nP.S. \u2014I will return the picture after I have showed it to Miss Lyon. It\nwill not be of much use, but I might as well do it.\nMr. Newbold writes later :\u2014\n4,228, Chester-avenue, Philadelphia, Pa., December 6th, 1890.\n*****\nI purposely delayed visiting Mrs. Kellogg for awhile, to give her an\nopportunity of finding that missing book. Yesterday I went again.\nI saw Mrs. Kellogg and asked especially after Miss Lyon. Mrs. K.\nthought she was out. She sent for Jackson and I talked with him and Mrs.\nKellogg for some time without learning anything of importance. He, Jack\nson, repeated in almost the same words what he had told me before.\nNo boarders are now in the house who were there when \"Brown\"\nwas there, nor could I learn the names or present addresses of any such. It\nis scarcely probable, they say, that anything could be learned from them.\nMost of their boarders take breakfast very early, and are off shortly after\nsix o'clock. \"Brown\" rarely came to breakfast much before seven, and\nusually was alone at table. Then he would chat with Jackson.\nAfter breakfast he used to go out\u2014always, except twice, returned to\nluncheon at 12 to 1.30 ; went out again and returned to dinner at six. When\nnot in the dining-room he spent nearly all his time in his room. The two\nexceptions above referred to were two days when he was in Norristown and\nwas absent from breakfast until dinner. He never sat in the parlour, and\nwas never known to talk to any of the other boarders. He first appeared at\nthe house one forenoon shortly before lunchtime. Engaged his room, as is\nthere customary, for a week. He went away two weeks from that date after\nbreakfast. Of this Jackson felt quite sure, for, he said, he remembered\nhaving remarked at the time that if he had stayed to luncheon he would\nhave become liable for another week's board. When he first came he did\nnot, so far as Mrs. Kellogg could recollect, mention where he came from.\nHe told Jackson, however, several times. Jackson only remembers that it\nwas a village near Boston, and as I had neglected to take your letter with\nme I was not able to ascertain whether he could recognise the name. I\nasked Jackson the following questions, but he had no recollection of ever\nhaving heard \"Mr. Brown\" say anything about any such subjects: \"Did\nhe ever mention the denomination to which he belonged?\" \"Not that I\nremember. I don't know whether he was a Methodist or Presbyterian.\"\n\"Did he ever mention church-going?\" \"No recollection of it.\" \"Ever\nspeak of Baptists ? Of having been an infidel ? Having been converted ?\nHaving had any very extraordinary experience ? Having ever been struck\nblind ? Deaf ? or dumb ? Ever mention cards ? Were cards ever suggested\nto him ? Did he ever see them played ?\" At this point Mrs. K. explained that\nhe never associated with the other boarders or came into the parlour. \" Ever\nsmoke ? Use tobacco in any form ? Drink ?

Jackson says no\u2014that it was a sort of\nnotion store. Besides the comfortables and tinware I mentioned before,\nJackson recollected curtains, toys, candies, and long rolls, perhaps five feet\nlong, four inches in diameter. Contents unknown. About two days after\nleaving he came in again ; saw Jackson, and told him that he was getting on\nvery nicely in his new enterprise. I thanked Jackson for his information,\nand said I would not trouble him further.\nI asked again for Miss Lyon. Mrs. K. went to see whether she was in.\nReturned, saying that her sister was in ; said that she had scarcely ever\nspoken to \"Mr. Brown.\" Probably never would have, except that, as her\nroom was No. 5 and his No. 7 she occasionally supplied him with matches or\nsuch little necessaries. The only thing she recollected having heard him\nsay was that he had secured a nice, quiet little place in a confectioner's or\nbaker's store, where he had two rooms all to himself, and would be secure\nfrom annoyance. I asked Mrs. Kellogg to show Miss Lyon the picture.\nShe did so, and said that Miss Lyon recognised it as Mr. Brown instantly.\nI should have said above that Jackson thought it odd that \"Brown \"\nshould have made no mention of religious matters, for he, Jackson, had\nquizzed him once or twice on being a clergyman, on account of his venerable\nappearance.\nMrs. Kellogg had not yet found her book. Promised to search for it,\nand to let me know when it was found.\nWll.

His mother was a descendant of General\nGreene, of revolutionary fame. A brother died aged 3 months, cause\nunknown. Two sisters, older, are still living in good health. It is said that\nthe subject, Ansel Bourne, did not walk until two years old. No physical\ncause for this. Believes that he has had the ordinary children's diseases.\nDoes not recollect that he ever had any serious illness as a child. Never\nhad any fever of any kind. His early days were not characterised by mental\nexcitement. Was not excited at all, but deliberate, cool, and in general\nmatters always characterised by presence of mind. This has often saved\nhim from injury to life.\n\"Has never had any severe injury ; no blow on the head ; was not in the\nwar.\n\" He has been prostrated sometimes from over-work, more from physical\nexhaustion than from mental excitement. His attitude on questions is never\nimpulsive. He moves slowly, consistently, &c, and never had any illness\nsince [the remarkable experience of 1857].\n\f254 R. Hodgson.\n\" Has been a total abstainer from alcohol and tobacco for forty years\u2014\nnever intoxicated but once.\n\" Was married at age of nineteen. No venereal history.\n' ' Never had rheumatism. No chest trouble. Digestion good. Appetite\ngood. Tongue coated slightly. Bowels not so regular (costive) for two or\nthree days. Sleep is not very good\u2014inclined to wakefulness. Pain of late\nin his right side\u2014under the right floating ribs. No pain to-day.\n\"Is a tall man of 6ft. height. Weight 158.\n\" Eyesight has been poor for a good while. Glasses convex.\n\"No disturbance of vision except as above. No diplopia.\"\nAbridgment from Notes by E. Cowles, M.D.\nMay 30th, 1890.\nHis own melancholy fits come a dozen times a year\u2014sometimes in\nthem will walk off 2 or 3 miles without knowing where he is. No aura\nprecedes. No exhilaration afterwards. In early life studied very hard;\nlater anxiety of meeting congregations, &c, produced a \"sinking away,\" not\nexactly fainting. Tongue occasionally sore at end, but no traces of biting.\nPatellar reflexes normal. No clonus of foot. Pupils equal\u2014react readily.\nSensibility to light touch on hands; head and ears normal.\nExamination of Ansel Bourne, May 30th, 1890, by Wm. Noyes, M.D.\nMr. Bourne's sensibility to touch (tested with fingers, cotton, pin, and\naesthesiometer) appeared entirely normal during his waking state, with the\nexception of a region about 4 by 3 inches (roughly) on inner side of left thigh\nwhere the sensibility was diminished. No anaesthetic or tender spots could\nbe discovered on back, spinal column, chest, or limbs, either upper or lower.\nIn the hypnotic state there was some diminution of sensibility but not\nvery marked. A small bit of cotton let fall three or four inches on his\nhead where he was bald was felt, although the reply was given very slowly.\nA pin could be stuck into the back of his hand and he would allow it to\nremain. Said it felt about one quarter inch in diameter. Did not recognise\nit as a pin. Patellar tendon reflexes were equal and normal, and pupils\nresponded readily to light, both in and out of the hypnotic state. Examina\ntion of the tongue showed nothing that could be definitely identified as a\nscar. On the right side of this organ, near the middle, there was a small\nspot about 3 by 1 m.m. that had a slightly different colour from the surround\ning tissues, but could not definitely be identified as scar-tissue.\n(No magnifying glass was used.)\nNotes by Professor Wm. James, M.D.\nMay 30th, 1890.\nHe was tried during this afternoon by Drs. Wadsworth and Jack, both\nin and out of the trance. No difference of vision or hearing was discovered\nin the two states. He recognised tobacco and vinegar in the trance by their\nsmell, and also salt and sugar on his tongue, though the sugar was recognised\nslowly. I found, to my surprise, that he discriminated points about as well\non the palmar surface of hands or fingers when in as when out of the trance.\nThe tardiness of his replies made it seem as if he must be more insensitive.\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 255\nThe only difference between trance and waking as to sensibility seems then to\nbe a not very pronounced analgesia during trance.\nProduced hallucination of red cross in trance. No after image. Waked\nhim by upward passes made without warning.\nExamination of Ansel Bourne, May 30th, 1890, by O. F.\nWadsworth, M.D.\nRight eye, central opacity of cornea, about 2 m.m. diameter ; left eye,\ntwo dots of opacity in cornea a little below centre. Pupils react well.\nField of vision of normal extent in each eye. Discs normal for age ; little\npigment in epithelial layer generally, in either eye ; in other respects fundus\nnormal. Hypermetropia shown by ophthalmoscope, about 3 d., but re\nfraction different through different parts of cornea, owing to the opacities.\nNo means at hand for testing vision accurately.\nReport of the Examination of Mr. Brown's Hearing, by Frederick\nL. Jack, M.D.\nMay 30th, 1890.\nThe hearing power for the voice was impaired on both sides. He could\nhear the tuning-fork, \"C,\" better in the right ear than in the left. In\ncontact with the cranial bones it was heard more distinctly on the left side.\nAcoumeter was heard at about four (4) inches from the right and two (2)\nfrom the left ear. Tickings of the watch perceived only when pressed\nagainst the right ear ; not heard on contact in the left. When watch was\nput between the teeth (bone conduction) nothing was heard. Tests in the\npatient's natural state were the same, but answers were quicker.\nAPPENDIX D.\nAmbulatory Automatism in a Hysterical Man.\nBy Dr. Proust, Professor of Hygiene at the Hotel Dieu, of Paris.\n(The case was published in the Revue de L'HypnotUme, March, 1890, and\nthe following resume was printed in the Journal S.P.R. for May, 1890.)\nEmile X. , ^Et. 33, is a barrister in Paris ; of good ability and education\nin classical studies, both as a boy and at the university. He was always ner\nvous and over-sensitive, with some hysterical attacks and functional derange\nments of motion and sensation, signs, in fact, of \" la grande hysteric\" He\ncould be hypnotised very easily, and while M. Luys had him in charge he\ncould be put to sleep by a loud noise, or any sudden impression. One day\nin a cafe\" he saw himself in the looking-glass and at once fell into a hypnotic\nstate which frightened his friends and led them to take him to a hospital,\nwhere he recovered without any difficulty. Sometimes his attacks were\ndifferent ; he would seem to his companions to undergo no loss of conscious\nness, but would lose the memory of all his past life during a few minutes or\na few days and in this condition of secondary consciousness would lead an\nactive and apparently normal life on foot or on horseback, in his friends'\nhouses or in shops. From such a state he woke suddenly and was entirely\nwithout memory of what had happened to him in this secondary state. An\ninstance of this occurred on September 23rd, 1888. He had had a quarrel\n\f256 R. Hodgson.\nwith hLs stepfather in Paris, which had excited him considerably, and he fell\ninto his second state. Three weeks later he woke after his usual fashion,\nwithout any memory whatever of what had been happening, and found\nhimself at Villars-Saint-Marcelin, in the Haute Marne, more than 100 miles\nfrom Paris. He picked up from various sources a little knowledge of what\nhe had done. He was told he had visited the priest of the village, who had\nthought him \" odd \" ; that he had also stayed with one of his uncles who was\na bishop in the Haute Marne, and at hLs house had broken various things,\nand torn up some MSS. of his uncle's ; that he had run into debt to the extent\nof \u00a320, and that he had been summoned before the court at Yassy on some\ncharge of petty theft, and in his absence judgment had been given against\nhim. Again, on May 11th, 1889, he was breakfasting at a restaurant in\nParis, and two days later found himself at Troyes. Of what had happened\nduring these two days he could remember nothing. He recollected that\nbefore losing his consciousness he had had a greatcoat and a purse in it\ncontaining 226fr.\nThese facts reminded Professor Proust of the well-known case of Felida\nX., and of the more recent case of Louis V. (Proceedings of the Society for\nPsychical Rssearch, XI., 497,) in which the memory of the secondary\npersonality was recalled by hypnotism. Emile X. was easily hypnotised, and\nin that state could give a full account of what had happened to him in his\nstates of secondary personality. In his first of these two attacks he described\nhow he had lorit some of the \u00a320 at cards, and told the complete story of\nwhat he had done when staying with his uncle, the bishop, and afterwards\nwith the priest. In the same way as to his visit to Troyes, he told the details\nof his journey, of the friends he had dined with there, and where he had left\nhis overcoat and purae. Notes were taken of his hypnotic account, and on\nthe strength of these he wrote to the hotel keeper at Troyes asking for his\ncoat and purse, and describing where he had left them. Two days later, to\nhis great astonishment, he received them both, and the 226fr. in the purse.\nThe court at Vassy, also, when his true condition had become known, reversed\nthe judgment given against him.\nAPPENDIX E.\nA Case of Epilepsy with Double Consciousness.\n(Extract from an article by G. R. Trowbridge, M.D., assistant physician\nto the State Hospital for the Insane, Danville, Pa., published in the Medical\nNews, February 21st, 1891. Lea Brothers and Co., Philadelphia.)\nThe patient is a German, male, aged fifty-two years, admitted February\n3rd, 1888\u2014his second admission to the hospital. He is about 5 feet 8 inches\nin height, weighs about 150 pounds, and is thick-set, and very muscular.\nAll of his toes have been lost, and his fingers more or less disabled by frost\nbite. He has been subject to epileptic convulsions since 1862, and was first\nattacked while working on a Transatlantic steamer, where he was a stoker. Ho\nthinks that the disease was caused by the intense heat to which he was ex\nposed. There is no family history of epilepsy or of any other nervous affec\ntion, and no record of insanity. The epileptic attacks are of a most violent\n\fA Case of Double Consciousness. 257\nnature (grand mal), and occur about once every month or six weeks. He then\nhas from three to six convulsions, and never during the time he has been\nin my charge has he had single convulsions in the interval. For several days\npreceding the convulsions he complains of pain in the left inguinal region,\nand says that it is \"due to a fall he had when on board ship.\" There is\nno evidence of anything abnormal in this region, and I regard the pain as an\naura, as he never complains of it except just before the attack. Shortly after\nthis aura (from twenty-four to thirty-six hours) he has a convulsion, and on\nrecovering from this becomes somewhat irritable and sullen. Other convul\nsions follow until he has had from three to six. His irritability and sullen-\nness increase in proportion to the number of convulsions, and he finally\nlapses into a perfect condition of double identity, the original Ego being com\npletely destroyed, and during this period of second self it is necessary to\nplace him in seclusion.\nThe time occupied during the transition from the first condition to the\nsecond is from two to four days, varying according to the interval between\nthe epileptic attacks.\nDuring this period of \"second self\" he becomes very violent and\nabusive, and can be approached only after being physically overpowered.\nWhen he passes into this condition he at first refuses nourishment, but\ntoward the latter part of the period he will swallow if a cup is held to his\nmouth, though it is necessary to restrain his hands and feet. If left to him\nself he is, as a rule, comparatively quiet, and, as far as I can ascertain, his\nsleep is not disturbed.\nThis condition lasts from five to ten days, and his return to a normal con\ndition rarely occupies more than twenty-four hours, though on one or two\noccasions it has taken somewhat longer. For some time after the return to\nhis normal condition he speaks in a husky voice, and complains that his\nthroat is sore, and for some days he is abstracted and listless.\nWhen in his normal condition, the man is of a pleasant disposition, and\ndoes a great deal of work about the ward. When questioned in regard to\nhis sensations during the periods of \" second self,\" he says he can tell no\nthing except that everybody and everything is strange to him, and that he\nknows nothing of what he says or does. But he can describe circumstances\nand occurrences which took place before the development of his \" second\ncondition,\" i.e., during a previous normal period.\nThe expression of his face during the period of \" second self \" is altered,\nchanging from a rather pleasant expression to one of intense anger and\nhatred. In short, I do not think that Stevenson's ' ' Dr. Jekyll and Mr.\nHyde \" could be worse than this man, were he given his liberty.\nOn one occasion, before his admission to this hospital, while in his second\nstate, he was disturbed by his wife, who endeavoured to make him eat, and\nin the paroxysm of rage caused by this he tried to kill her with a hatchet,\nbut was prevented by the timely interference of the neighbours. He after\nwards said that he had no recollection at all of the matter.\n\f\fs\u00bbppiement.] Third Ad Interim Report. ,259\nSUPPLEMENT.\ni.\nTHIRD AD INTERIM REPORT ON THE CENSUS OF\nHALLUCINATIONS.\nEngland.\nUp to July 1st, 1891.\nThe total number of answers received up to this date is :\n\"No.\" \"Yes.\" Totals.\n3854 365 4219\n4360 697 5057\nTotals 8214 1062 9276\nPercentage of affirmative answers, ll-45.\nOf the persons answering \" Yes,\" 164 have as yet sent no particulars.\nThe number of persons who have had more than one experience\u2014\neither the same repeated more than once, or different experiences\u2014is 300.\nOf these, 118 have had only auditory or tactile experiences, generally of a\ntrivial kind.

Only about 84 out'of some 700 have so\nfar sent me any answers, though I hope that others may already have partly\nfilled forms which will reach me in course of time. One great object aimed\nat in forming a society like ours is that the members may co-operate in\npsychical inquiries when opportunity offers.

Sidgwick.\nII.\nON SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHS ;\nA REPLY TO MR. A. R. WALLACE.\nBy Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nThe review of the evidence for what are called \"spirit photographs\"\nwhich I am about to present to the reader was substantially written in\n1885 or 1886, when I was engaged in writing an article on Spiritualism\nfor the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and had, therefore, to read and\nestimate the evidence in all branches of the subject. I did not offer\nthe paper to the Society for Psychical Research, because its attention\nhad not been specially drawn to the subject and, as will be seen, my\nconclusions were on the whole negative. It appeared to me that,\nafter eliminating what might certainly or probably be attributed to\ntrickery, the remaining evidence was hardly sufficient in amount to\nestablish even a primd facie case for investigation, in view of the\nimmense theoretical difficulties involved.\nBut recently Mr. Alfred Russel \"Wallace, in an article entitled \"Are\nthere Objective Apparitions 1 \" contributed to an American periodical,\nThe Arena (for January, 1891), has again appealed to Spirit Photo\ngraphs as evidence of the objectivity in question, and has challenged the\nSociety for Psychical Research to deal with this evidence. He says :\u2014\n\" This long series of photographic experiments and tests . . . has been\nhitherto not even alluded to by the investigators of the Society for Psychical\nResearch. But they cannot much longer continue to ignore it, because they\nhave entered on the task of collecting the whole of the evidence for psychical\nphenomena, and of fairly estimating the weight of each of the groups under\nwhich that evidence falls. Now I submit that this photographic evidence is\nsuperior in quality to any that they have hitherto collected, for two reasons.\nIn the first place, it is experimental evidence, and experiment is rarely\npossible in the higher psychical phenomena ; in the second place, it is the\nevidence of experts, in an operation the whole details of which are perfectly\nfamiliar to them. And, I further submit, this evidence can no longer be\nignored because it is evidence that goes to the very root of the whole inquiry\nand affords the most complete and crucial test in the problem of subjectivity\nor objectivity of apparitions.\"\nMr. Wallace is too eminent a man and too much interested in our\ninvestigations for such a challenge to pass unnoticed and it has, there\nfore, been thought that the following examination of the evidence to\nwhich he appeals had better be published.\n\fSupplement.] 269\nOn Spirit Photographs.\nI may add that Mr. \"Wallace is expressing now the same opinion\nthat he expressed in 1874, in his book entitled Miracles and Modem\nSpiritualism. He said then of spirit photography : \" It is that which\nfurnishes, perhaps, the most unassailable demonstration it is possible to\nobtain of the objective reality of spiritual forms.\"\nSpirit photographs\u2014or at least those species of them which I pro\npose to deal with here 1\u2014are photographs representing figures or objects\nwhich at the moment the photograph seemed to be taken had no\napparent counterpart in the field of view discoverable by the normal\nsight. A photographer with the faculty of producing such photo\ngraphs would, in taking a portrait of a human sitter, sometimes obtain\nthat of some other person on the same plate. If the sitter was\nfortunate, it would be that of a deceased relation. Sometimes persons\npossessing, or supposed to possess, the faculty of seeing spirits said that\nthey saw the form which ultimately appeared on the plate hovering\nnear the sitter, though invisible to ordinary eyes.\nAs this paper will be critical rather than descriptive, it will be\ndesirable to. give at the outset a brief account of the periodicals and\nbooks where evidence on the subject may be found, which will have the\nfurther advantage of saving continual references as we go on.\nA collection of the evidence on the subject was made by \"M.A.\n(Oxon.)\" in a series of papers contributed to Human Nature in 1874\nand 1 875, and this is the best summary of it which I have seen. It\nneeds supplementing, however. In particular Mr. Beattie's accounts of\nhis own experiments (see British Journal of Photography for 1872\nand 1873; Spiritualist for July, 1872 ; Spiritual Magazine for\nSeptember, 1872, abbreviated slightly from the Spiritualist ; , and\nSpiritual Magazine for November, 1873, from the British Journal of\nPhotography) should be read. Some of the evidence scattered through\nthe Spiritual Magazine from 1872 to 1875 is important, though the\nbest is given by \" M.A. (Oxon.) \" Also much light is thrown on the\nsubject by the controversy about the genuineness of Hudson's photo\ngraphs in the Spiritual Magazine and Spiritualist for 1872, and by\nthe trial of Buguet, for accounts of which see various numbers of the\nSpiritualist for 1875 and 1876, and especially Madame Leymarie's\nProces des Sjnrites (Paris, 1875). Mr. Wallace devotes several pages\nto the subject of spirit photography in his Miracles and Modern\nSpiritualism. The Spiritual Magazine for 1869 gives the trial of\nMumler, and the Spiritual Magazine for 1862 and 1863 contains\n1 Mr. Wallace applies the name also to photographs of so-called \"materialised\nspirits.\" In the case of \"materialisations,\" however, it is not usually the genuine\nness of the photographic process, but merely the spirituality of the figure photo\ngraphed which the sceptic calls in question.\n\f270 [Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgwick.\nsome account of Mumler's early performances at Boston. To these\nreferences I must now (1891) add M. Aksakoff's Animismus und\nSpiritismus (Leipzig, 1890), in which a long chapter devoted to the\nsubject contains some additional evidence. '\nWe may divide the evidence for Spirit Photographs into that obtained\nwith professional photographers who made a profit out of it, and that\nobtained by investigators apart from anyone with a pecuniary interest\nin the result. I shall begin with the first class, because it is by far the\nlargest.\nMumler in America, who began operations at Boston in 1862,\nHudson and Parkes in London 10 years later, and Buguet at Paris,\nwho flourished and fell in 1874-1875, have been the principal pro\nfessional Spirit Photographers. There have been others, especially in\nAmerica, but they are less well known, at least in this country, and\nat any rate the four I have named will sufficiently serve as types. Of\nthese four, Mumler, Hudson, and Buguet produced sham Spirit Photo\ngraphs, whether they produced real ones or not.\nMumler had been at work but a few months when, early in 1863,\nit appeared that a living person figured in at least two of his\nphotographs as a spirit of the dead. This seems temporarily to have\ngiven a blow to his credit and he sank into obscurity. In 1869 he\nreappeared at New York, with testimonials mostly dating from 1862,\nwhich looks as if he had not done much in the interval. It was a few\nmonths after he settled at New York that his trial\u2014referred to by Mr.\nWallace\u2014for swindling credulous persons by what he called Spirit\nPhotographs took place. This time he was more fortunate than in\n1863. Only New York evidence was admitted, and the only definite\nNew York evidence against him appears to have been that of Marshal\nJ. H. Tooker, who had been sent by the Mayor (it was a public prosecu\ntion) to \" look up \" the case. This he did by assuming a false name\nand having his photograph taken by Mumler ; and the result was a\n\" spirit photograph,\" which he was told represented his father-in-law,\nbut which he said bore no resemblance to his father-in-law, or any\nother person he had known. For the defence was brought the\nevidence of photographers and others who had failed to discover any\ntrick, and that of persons who had obtained recognised likenesses of\ndeparted friends. The trial ended in Mumler's acquittal, the judge\nsaying, \"That, however he might believe that trick and deception had\nbeen practised by the prisoner, yet ... he was compelled to\ndecide that he should not be justified in sending the defence to the\ngrand jury, as, in his opinion, the prosecution had failed to prove the\ncase.\" (Spiritual Magazine for June, 1869.) This acquittal, consider\ning that the previous evidence against him was necessarily excluded,\nand that the prosecution seems to have been premature and hasty,\n\fsupplement.] On Spirit Photographs. 271\nrelying on the a priori probability that he cheated and not on proved\ninstances, can hardly be rega-rded as triumphant, nor as in any way\ninvalidating the previous evidence of fraud.\nAs to Hudson, very soon after he began the business, Mr. J.\nEnmore Jones, a leading Spiritualist, discovered on some of his photo\ngraphs clear signs of trickery. Other Spiritualists\u2014some of them\nexpert photographers\u2014now inquired into the matter, and the fact was\nclearly established that there was something wrong about many of the\nphotographs. It was alleged against them (see Spiritualist for Sep\ntember, 1872) that they showed obvious signs of double exposure, such\nas the background appearing through the dress of the mundane sitter,\nand marks in the background appearing duplicated ; that some of them\nbore evident marks of having been altered by hand ; and that in one\nor more of them Heme, the medium, had sat for the ghost. The marks\nare so clear that Mr. Beattie, of Clifton, \"pronounced the photographs\nalluded to to be not only deception, but deception of the stupidest ;\nand more, that the evidence was so palpable that, unless we are to\nbecome as 'little children' in common observation, and very weak\nchildren too, we could not but see them as such.\"\nA controversy now began to rage among Spiritualists :\u2014Hudsonites,\nheaded by Mr. Thomas Shorter, editor of the Spiritual Magazine,\nsupported by the Medium, against anti-Hudsonites, headed by Mr. W.\nH. Harrison, editor of the Spiritualist (a paper which at that time\nheld much the same position that Light does now). Both parties\nbelieved that Hudson produced some genuine photographs, and the\nappearances of double exposure were not denied by the Hudsonites.\nBut these last stoutly maintained that there was no proof of fraud\nagainst Hudson. They explained that the effects which looked like\nthose of double exposure, &c, were probably produced by the spirits.\nThus \" spirits \" told them that \" the success of our manifestations in\nthese cases is to bring ourselves within the sphere of the sitter, and to\namalgamate that sphere with our own. When rays of light pass\nthrough this mixed aura they are refracted and often cause things to\nbe apparent on the plate which you cannot account for.\" (See\nHuman Nature for October, 1872, p. 448, and editorial article in\nthe Spiritual Magazine for November, 1872, p. 482.) Another advo\ncate suggests that the \" psychical aura \" may produce the effect either\nowing to its having the property of double refraction, or to its having\na different density from the atmosphere and being introduced after\nthe exposure has begun, so that the rays of light are differently\ndeflected during the first and second half of the exposure. Again,\nit is suggested in the Spiritual Magazine, 1872, p. 413, that the spirits\nmay produce the effect by slightly displacing the camera. \"Photo\ngraphers,\" the writer continues, \" will say that a proof of that would\n\f272 [Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgwick.\nappear upon the picture of the sitters\"(which,we mayremark,would apply\nalso to the last mentioned theory); \"but as a spirit can, in the sphere of\nsome mediums, change the modes of material substances, can a spirit\nnot also, in such a sphere, so modify light that the pictures taken by\nhim shall not interfere with that of the sitters taken by the photo\ngrapher ? \" And in an editorial article in the Spiritual Magazine for\nOctober, 1872, p. 465, we are told \"when professional photographers\nare as familiar with the laws and methods of spiritual photography, as\nthe more scientific members of the profession are with those of\ncommon photography, their opinions on this question will be entitled\nto greater weight. Perhaps by that time they may have learned that\nphenomena of spiritual agency are not to be wholly judged by those\nnarrow canons of professional criticism which apply well enough to\nphenomena of purely physical and mundane origin.\"\nArguments such as these show to what straits Hudson's defenders\nwere reduced. It should, however, be said for them that they believed\nthat a Mr. Russell, of Kingston-on-Thames, experimenting for his own\nsatisfaction, had obtained Spirit Photographs with Heme and Williams\nas sitters, exhibiting signs of double exposure, though only one exposure\nhad taken place. As, however, neither the negatives nor prints from\nthem were ever openly produced in this case, and as their disappearance\nwas explained by saying that, \" unfortunately, some mischievous\ngnome . . . used means to obliterate the most interesting pictures\nwhile in ,an unfinished state\" (Human Nature, November, 1872, p.\n499) we may be permitted to consider this evidence as worthless.\nHudson's friends also argued that double exposure could not be a sign\nof fraud, because a certain photograph obtained by Dr. Dixon, with a\nrecognised likeness of his dead son\/ showed signs of it, and also a\nlikeness of a spirit friend, recognised by Mr. H. Clifford Smith, came out\npositive on the negative of the sitter. To most of us it will, I think,\nappear that the peculiarities of these photographs throw doubt on the\nvalue of recognition as a test of genuineness in a Spirit Photograph,\nrather than prove that genuineness is compatible with double exposure.\nBuguet's fraud is, if possible, even more beyond question. He was\nbrought to trial for swindling by the French Government in 1875, and\nstated at his trial that all his Spirit Photographs were fraudulent and\ngenerally done by means of cardboard heads and dummy figures draped\nat discretion and produced on the plate by double exposure. Later,\nafter he had escaped to Belgium, he partly retracted this and said that\nsome were genuine. But there can be no doubt that, as \" M.A.\n1 This likeness does not seem to have been very successful as to face ; apeculiarity\nof dress satisfied Dr. Dixon. (See Human Nature for November, 1874, p. 485, and\nSpiritual Magazine for 1872, pp. 321 and 484.)\n\fSupplement.] 273\nOn Spirit Photographs.\n(Oxon.)\" puts it (Human Nature, 1875, p. 334), \"a recent trial in\nParis has furnished clear evidence of a long and systematic course of\nfraud. . . . Buguet, by his own confession as well as by demonstra\ntion, stands revealed as an impostor.\"\nParkes, the fourth professional spirit photographer I have named,\nproduced photographs of very suspicious appearance, but took the line\nof frankly admitting this and even calling attention to it, while he\nattributed it to the peculiar methods of operating adopted by the\nspirits. He gave investigators less opportunity of examining into his\nprocesses than Mumler, Hudson, and Buguet seemed to do, and there\ncould, therefore, be little chance of proving any fraud so long as he\nkept clear of Mumler's great error\u2014producing living people for dead\nones. This is a description of one photograph taken in his studio which\nillustrates what I mean by suspicious appearances :\u2014\n\"It was taken on a plate freshly purchased, and which had never been in\nMr. Parkes' possession. The plate had been prepared and placed in the\nshield, when a photographer who was present requested that it might be\ntaken out and turned upside down before the exposure. This was done, and,\non developing the plate, a rude outline of a figure, composed of two busts,\nappears ; the busts pointing in opposite directions. Had this occurred on a\nplate which the photographer had had in his possession before, most of us\nwould have jumped at unfavourable conclusions.\" (Human Nature for\nApril, 1875, p. 157.)\nProbably most of our readers will still arrive at \" unfavourable\nconclusions \" as to this performance, taking into account the conditions\ndescribed. I may observe that if Parkes' statements are accepted as\ntrustworthy, they present a hard nut to crack to those who maintain\nthat spirit photography is a proof of the objectivity of phantasms. He\npropounded the view, in the course of a discussion on the subject\nreported in the Spiritualist for December 10th, 1875, that the\nlens had nothing to do with the spirit photograph. Also that\nthe \" spirit light \" had the power to pass through opaque substances,\nsuch as the skull and reflecting mirrors. He proved this to his own\nsatisfaction\u2014so he said\u2014by experiment. Sitting himself and inserting\na mirror in the camera which would throw his image on to a sensitive\nplate at the side of the camera, and placing another sensitive plate at\nthe back of the camera behind the mirror, he says he obtained, as was\nnatural, an inverted image of himself on the side plate, but the-\n\"spirit\" came out erect on the back one. The \" spirits \" told him\nthat \" in the case of a ' spirit ' placing himself by the side of a sitter,\nit was, of course, necessary to produce an inverted image, and herein\nwas one of their greatest difficulties in taking spirit photographs.\"\nMr. Parkes consequently could not focus his spirit sitters. He\ngenerally saw them, he said, but moving the camera made no difference\n1\n\f274 Mrs. H. Sidgwich [Supplement.\nto their appearance as seen through the lens ; he had, therefore, to place\nit so as to harmonise the spirit's appearance with the sitter. 1 Parkes\nalso said that he could obtain spirit figures only on spiritually\nsensitised plates, and that any doubt or uncertainty in his mind as to\nwhether the plate had been spiritually sensitised prevented success.\nFrom these statements of Parkes we must infer either, as he\ndid himself, that \"spirit photographs\" are not really photographs at\nall, in which case spirit photography does not afford an unassailable\nproof of the objective reality of spirit forms as Mr. Wallace thinks it\ndoes ; or that Parkes never carried out the experiments he described.\nWe now come to the question whether, notwithstanding the fraud,\nany of these four persons ever produced genuine Spirit Photographs.\nThose Spiritualists who were most decided in maintaining that there\nwas deception contended that they all also produced the genuine\narticle. They thought so because\n(1) Competent persons had watched the process throughout with\nout detecting trickery ; and\n(2) Because among the photographs taken a certain number were\nrecognised as likenesses of some dead person.\nIt is on the first of these considerations that Mr. Wallace relies in\nhis article in the Arena. And I think some force must be allowed\nto it. It is certainly remarkable that there is, so far as I know, no record\nof either Mumler or Hudson being detected in the act of committing\nthe fraud, so that the proof against them rests only on the results pro\nduced. At Mumler's trial evidence was given by a photographer,\nnamed Silver, who had sold his studio and apparatus to Mumler, that\nwith unusual opportunities for observing, and working with him from\nNovember to March, several times watching the process he went\nthrough as closely as he could, he at no time detected any fraud or\ndeception on his part. I do not know whether Mr. Silver was a dis\ninterested witness, but he swore that there was no collusion between\nthem, and said he was not certain that the impressions were produced\n1 He does not say whether the spirits stood on their heads to make this possible,\nbut I may observe that no such peculiarity is noticed on one occasion in which \" M.A.\n(Oxon.)\" believed that he saw the \"spirit\" while he was being photographed by\nParkes. \" M.A. (Oxon.) \" says :\u2014\" In my clairvoyant state I saw the child standing\nor hovering by me close to my left shoulder. She seemed to be standing near the table:\nand I tried in vain to call Dr. Speer's attention to her. As soon as the exposure was\nover, and I awoke, I stated what I had seen, and on the plate being developed, there\nstands apparently on the table a little child's figure. The position is exactly where I\nsaw and felt it.\" (Human Nature, 1874, p. 397.) I am not, under the circumstances,\ndisposed to attach much importance to this correspondence of \"M.A. (Oxon.)'s\"\nimpression and the photograph as evidence of genuineness, partly because a baby sister\nof Dr. Speer's was believed often to communicate through \" M.A. (Oxon.) \" at seances,\nand it is not unlikely that Parkes knew this.\n\fsupplement.] On Spirit Photographs. 275\nby supernatural means. (See Spiritual Magazine, June, 1869, p. 249.)\nMr. J. Gurney, a well-known photographer at New York, and a Spirit\nualist, also stated at the trial that he had failed to discover any trick ;\nbut I confess that this gentleman's evidence would have more weight\nwith me had I not seen an account of his experience with another\nmedium, Mrs. French. (Spiritual Magazine for 1861, p. 433, &c.) A\nthird photographer, named Slee, of Poughkeepsie, about whom I have no\nother information, wrote to the New York Tribune that Mumler had\nproduced spirit photographs in his (Mr. Slee's) studio and with his\napparatus, &c, and under the closest scrutiny of his operator and him\nself and assistants, without any second negative or mechanical arrange\nment whatever being discovered. (See Spiritual Magazine, June,\n1869, pp., 264-266.) 1\nAbout Hudson we have the evidence of Mr. Beattie, already men\ntioned, whose honesty is beyond suspicion, and who had himself been\na professional photographer; who was, moreover, one of those most\nstrongly convinced that some of Hudson's photographs were fraudulent.\nHe and a friend, an amateur photographer, visited Hudson and had\nphotographs taken, watching the process with care, and he says of the\nspirit figures which came out :\u2014\n\"They were not made by double exposure, nor by figures being projected\nin space in any way ; they were not the result of mirrors ; they were not\nproduced by any machinery in the background, behind it, above it, or below\nit, nor by any contrivance connected with the bath, the camera, or the\ncamera-slide.\" 2\nSimilarly Mr. Traill Taylor, the editor of the British Journal of\nPhotography (Human Nature, 1874, p. 477) says that he had tried\nexperiments in Hudson's studio with his own plates and collodion, and\nthat \"at no time during the preparation, exposure, or development of\nthe pictures was Mr. Hudson within 10 feet of the camera or dark room.\nAppearances,\" he adds, \"of an abnormal kind did certainly appear on\nseveral plates.\"\nMr. Thomas Slater, optician, of 136, Euston-road, again, says that he\ntook a new camera, a new combination of lenses, and several glass\nplates, and then, watching the process throughout, obtained \" a fine\nspirit picture.\" (Spiritual Magazine, June, 1872, p. 258.) And this\n1 I do not think that Mr. Guay's evidence should be introduced in this connection\nas it is by \"M. A. (Oxon.) \" and by M. Aksakof, because Guay seems to have been\nMumler's assistant, receiving half the profits of the business. (See Spiritual Magazine,\n1869, p. 243.)\n2 British Journal of Photography for July 11th, 1873, as quoted in Human Nature\nfor November, 1874, p. 479. Mr. Beattie and his friend had four photographs taken ;\nthe first (in which Mr. Beattie sat) was a failure ; the two next (in which Mr. Beattie\nsat), successes, the last (in which the friend sat) was again a failure.\n\f276 [Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgwick.\nwas after having twice watched the whole process so far as this could\nbe done whilst also acting as sitter.\nWhen Buguet came to England, in 1874, Mr, W. H. Harrison, with\nothers, witnessed the process. Mr. Harrison sums up his report in the\nSpiritualist of June 26th, 1874, as quoted in Human Nature of January,.\n1875, p. 15, after describing how he watched throughout all that\nBuguet did : \" Obviously it is not possible to say much about spirit\nphotography on the slender experience of observing one experiment,,\nbut I do not know how to produce by artificial means a similar picture,\nunder like conditions.\"\nAnd Mr. Slater (already mentioned), says of Buguet (see Proces\ndes Sjrirites, p. 145) :\u2014,\n\" J'ai fait avec lui plusieurs experiences. Comme photographe, j'assistai\na toutes les manipulations depuis le nettoyage de la plaque jusqu'au\ndeveloppement de l'image, et dans aucun cas, il ne m'a pas tromp\u00a3 ni ne l'a\npas pu. J'ai eu le portrait de ma tante, qui a it6 une mere pour moi.\"\nThis absence of detection by persons watching is certainly remark\nable ; but I think that Mr. Wallace and others overrate its import\nance. The question is how far an intelligent person ought to expect\nto detect trickery of the kind here supposed\u2014-which is practically\nconjuring\u2014how far he ought to expect to see all that goes on within his\npossible field of vision when someone else is trying to prevent his seeing\nit, and I believe that the majority of persons expect too much of them\nselves and others in this way. It is not a proof of stupidity to be\nunable to see when or how a trick is done ; even conjurers cannot do\nthis always, or they would not need to buy each other's tricks. The\nordinary mistake of eye-witnesses who relate experiences of this kind\nis to over-estimate their powers of observation and memory. In\nparticular the assertion, \" I never for an instant lost sight of so and\nso,\" if the \" never \" extends over any considerable length of time, is\ngenerally, I think, untrue, and is almost certain to be untrue if the\nobserver has attempted to guard simultaneously against all the ways in\nwhich he conceives that the trick may have been done. I believe that\nany one who would endeavour conscientiously to write accounts of what\nhe saw at a conjuring entertainment would convince himself of this ;\nunless he convinced himself\u2014as some Spiritualists have done\u2014that the\nconjurer is a medium. On this point I would refer to Mr. S. J. Davey's\nexperiments (Proceedings, Vol. IV., pp. 405-495), which appear to me\nto prove conclusively that intelligent persons thinking that they have\nthe conditions under their own control may not only be taken in, but\nmay believe the event to have occurred in such a way as to render the\nparticular trick actually practised impossible.\nIn the particular case of spirit photography there are several things\nwhich seem to make it especially hard to detect trickery. One is, the\n\fsupplement.) On Spirit PTwtographs. 277\ngreat complication of the process of photography and the number of\n,ways in which sham ghost pictures may be done. Then, again, if the\nwatcher be also the sitter, there are special difficulties in the way of his\nobservation. For instance, \"M.A. (Oxon.)\" tells us in Human Nature\nfor September 1st, 1874, p. 395, of a certain photograph of which he\ngives a copy :\u2014\" This particular group was taken under strict test con\nditions. Dr. Speer and I followed the plate throughout. . . . We\nnever lost sight of the plate from the very first, and can give unhesitat\ning testimony that no suspicious element presented itself.\" But it is\nobvious from the plate itself that neither Dr. Speer nor \"M.A. (Oxon.)\"\nwere looking at the camera while the photograph was taken, and \"M.A.\n(Oxon.)\" at any rate was not looking at the photographer. Trickery is,\nof course, also made immensely easier by the fact that the photo\ngrapher is under no necessity to produce a Spirit Photograph at all if\ndetection would follow.\nTaking everything into consideration, I do not think that the non-\ndetection by experts affords sufficiently strong ground for believing that\nthe photographers in question have sometimes produced genuine Spirit\nPhotographs.\nWe have next to consider whether the recognition of portraits of\nspirits affords the required evidence of genuineness. This is not quite\nthe simple question it looks, and incidentally the discussion of it has\nan important bearing on another branch of Spiritualistic evidence\u2014\nthe supposed materialisation of recognised spirit friends.\nIn the first place we must observe that a large proportion of the\nspirit photographs ' were definitely unrecognised1 ; and many photo\ngraphs were recognised which never ought to have been. As \"M.A.\n(Oxon.)\" says (Human Nature for May, 1875, p. 202):\u2014\n\"Some people would recognise anything. A broom and a sheet are quite\nenough to make up a grandmother for some wild enthusiasts who go with\nthe figure in their eye, and see what they wish to see. ... I have had\npictures that might be anything in this or any other world sent to me, and\ngravely claimed as recognised portraits ; palpable old women authenticated as\n'my spirit brother dead seventeen years, as he would have been if he had,'\n&c.\"\nWhen \" M.A. (Oxon.) \" was compiling his papers on spirit photo\ngraphy for Human Nature, some 460 photographs came under his\nnotice, mostly, I think, sent by persons who thought them interesting,\nso that these 460 must be considered as a selected lot. Out of these,\n1 Buguet (see Prods desSpirites) named 50, 60, and 70 per cent, to clients on different\noccasions as the proportion of his successes. Thesenumbers may be taken as the largest\nnumbers he dared give without risking being afterwards regarded as an impostor.\nProbably the actual proportion which were thought to be recognised was much smaller.\n\f278 [Supplement.\n.flfrs. H. Sidgwick.\nhe could only select 90, or about one-fifth, for description, as being\neither distinctly recognisable or done under conditions such as, in his\nopinion, excluded trickery, and of these 90 I think some 82 are counted\nmainly because they were recognised. For evidential purposes this\nnumber must be considerably reduced, especially when it is remembered\nthat even when a recognised likeness was obtained it was very seldom\nthat of a particular person previously expected. \" M.A. (Oxon.) \"\nsays (Human Nature for June, 1876, p. 268) : \" Out of some 600\nphotographs which I have seen and examined, and of most of which\nI have heard the history, I do not know of half a dozen in which the\nexpected form appeared.\" And if I may infer from \"M.A. (Oxon's.) \"\ndescriptive lists which the half-dozen are, I should add that in only\none of these does it seem to me that there is not reason, apart from\nthe success, for thinking that the photographer knew beforehand what\nwas expected.\nI think that we must as a general rule regard recognition as\nevidentially unimportant in the following cases :\u2014\n(1) Spirit portraits of well-known or historical people and leading\nSpiritualists\u2014Dumas, Judge Edmonds, Allan Kardec, Livingstone,\nPresident Lincoln, <fec.\n(2) Photographs of near connexions of well-known Spiritualists,\nsince it would clearly be natural for a fraudulent spirit photographer\nto make himself acquainted by sight with as many Spiritualists as he\ncan, and to obtain likenesses of their deceased relatives.\n(3) Cases where an appointment made in advance or a second\nvisit gives a chance of preparation\u2014especially if such appointment has\nbeen made at the suggestion of, or through another medium, who may\nbe in collusion.1 If it be urged against this that it would, in many\ncases, be difficult for the fraudulent photographer to procure a likeness\nof a deceased friend of his sitter, it may be replied that this very fact\nmay be the reason why distinctly recognisable spirit photographs of\ndeparted friends were not more often produced. In some cases it is\neasy to obtain photographs of persons not long dead ; and with regard\nto those who died before photography was known it may be remarked\nthat the length of time since they were seen is sure to have caused\ntheir features to have faded somewhat from their friends' memories,\nand a portrait having a family likeness to the sitter might easily be\nproduced by the photographer, and would in some instances pass\nmuster as a likeness. We have to keep clearly before our minds that\n1 This excludes such a case as Mumler's photograph of Mr. Dow and Mabel\nWarren ; also such a case as Mr. Livermore's, who obtained an unrecognised figure\nat his first visit to Mumler, and, when he came again (on which occasion he thinks he\nwas recognised), obtained a likeness of his wife.\n\fsupplement.] On Spirit Photographs. 279\nthe photographer is under no obligation to produce a spirit photograph,\nthat, if he does produce it, it need not be a likeness, and that it would\nnot have told against him with Spiritualists had he produced what\nwas taken for a double of the sitter.\nAfter cutting out the three groups above mentioned, there doubt\nless still remains a residuum to be accounted for ; this, however,\nmust be yet further reduced owing to certain considerations as to\nthe value of recognition, which I shall now proceed to discuss. In\ndoing so I shall quote as instances of possibly inadequate recognition\nphotographs of which some would, probably, even if really recognised,\nbe excluded from an evidential list on one of the above-mentioned\ngrounds.\nOne important consideration is that in the majority of spirit photo\ngraphs the head is surrounded by white drapery in a way which we\nnever see in real life, and which, therefore, makes recognition more\ndifficult. This unaccustomedness of the appearance seems to me to\ninterfere with the reality of the recognition in several published\ncases. Thus, Mr. Sutherland (see Human Nature for November,\n1874, pp. 474, 475) says of an alleged photograph of his mother :\n\"I do not think anyone but myself could have recognised this\nphotograph owing to the unaccustomed appearance.\" In a photo\ngraph representing his sister he touched in the hair as it was habit\nually worn by her in earth-life, and in this condition it was at\nonce recognised. But perhaps it was then recognised by the hair,\nand if he had touched in the hair in the way it was worn by\nsome other relative it might have been recognised as that other.\n\" M.A. (Oxon.) \" quotes as recognised other cases where I cannot\nthink the recognition was adequate. Thus I cannot think the likeness\nwas clear which Madame Brocard Boulland discovered after a quarter\nof an hour's examination. (Human Nature, January, 1875, p. 20.)\nNor am I satisfied with the identification of an alleged portrait of Mr.\nWallace's mother, of which he says, in his Miracles and Modern\nSpiritualism, pp. 190, 191, footnote:\u2014\n\" I recognised none of these figures in the negatives ; but the moment I\ngot the proof the first glance showed me that the third plate contained an\nunmistakable portrait of my mother,\u2014like her both in features and\nexpression ; not such a likeness as a portrait taken during life, but a some\nwhat pensive, idealised likeness\u2014yet still to me an unmistakable likeness. The\nsecond figure is much less distinct ; the face is looking down ; it has a\ndifferent expression to the other, so that I at first concluded it was a different\nperson. . . . On sending the two . . . portraits to my sister, she\nthought that the second was much more like my mother than the third\u2014was,\nin fact, a good likeness, though indistinct, while the third seemed to her to\nbe like in expression but with something wrong about the mouth and chin.\nThis was found to be due, in part, to the filling up of spots by the photo\n\f280 [Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgwick.\ngrapher ; for when the picture was washed it became thickly covered with\nwhitish spots, but a better likeness of my mother.\" His brother writes to\nhim : \"I looked at the photograph attentively, and recognised your face, and\nremarked that the other one was something like Fanny (my sister). I then\nhanded it across the table to Mrs. W. and she exclaimed at once, ' Why,\nit's your mother ! ' We then compared it with a photograph of her we had\nhere and there could be no doubt of the general resemblance, but it has an\nappearance of sickness or weariness.\" \"M.A. (Oxon.) \" calls it (Human\nNature, November, 1874, p. 479) \"a very clear spirit form.\"\nRecognitions depending on peculiarities of dress are of very doubt\nful value. I cannot regard it as beyond the range of coincidence that\nMr. S. C. Hall's father should be represented with a pig-tail (which was\npractically the only point of identification), since pig-tails were the\nordinary costume not so very long ago, even if Mr. Hall's father was\none of the last to wear them ; nor that Dr. Dixon's son should appear\nto be draped in a \" hood and mantle in one,\" a costume which it appears\nhe had much approved of in his earth-life.\nAnother possible source of error has been suggested, namely, that\nwhen the sitter and his friends set to work to guess whom among their\ndeceased friends a spirit photograph represents, with the idea that it\nprobably represents one of them, a comparatively small amount of\nresemblance may mislead and satisfy them. This may explain the\nlikeness of Dr. Thomson's mother. Dr. Thomson's mother had died\nat his birth, 44 years before, and there was no picture of her. He\nobtained a spirit photograph which he did not recognise, and sent it to\nhis uncle, \"simply asking him,\" he says, \" to let me know if he recog\nnised in the figure any resemblance to any of my relations who have\ndied, and he has written to say that he recognises in it the likeness\nof my mother.\"1\nThere is another possibility in this and other cases, namely, that a\nsketch or altered photograph of the sitter himself adapted to pass as\na mother or sister may serve as a model for the spirit and be recog\nnised from family likeness. I think the evidence about Mr. Wallace's\nmother suggests this, and the following case, related by Mr. Beattie,\ndoes so also. He tells us in a paper on the philosophy of spirit photo\ngraphy (see Spiritual Magazine for January, 1873, p. 26) that he has\nbefore him, as he writes, two photographs of the same gentleman. In\none of them is, he says, a figure, \"clearly from an etching of a face,\n1 These are Dr. Thomson's own words (see Spiritual Magazine for October, 1873,\np. 475), and I may notice by the way that the field of inquiry suggested by them is very\nmuch narrower than that implied in \" M.A. (Oxon.)V' version. \" He sent the photo\ngraph to his uncle in Scotland, saying that he was sorry he could not recognise it.\nThe reply was that that was not surprising, seeing that the figure was that of Dr.\nThomson's own mother, who died at his birth.\" (Human Nature, October, 1874, p.\n42G.)\n\fsupplement.] On Spirit Photographs. 281\nwith a profile type exactly like his own ; in the other, there is a stand\ning figure extremely tall and ill-defined. In both cases it is said to\nhe his mother. A first-class artist examined them with me, and no\nlikeness could be discovered between the two.\" The photograph, already\nreferred to, which Buguet did for M. Brocard Boulland again suggests\nthis procedure. He says :\u2014\n\" Two days after I went again to M. Buguet and he gave me my photo\ngraph ; I examined it with the most minute and scrupulous attention. I\nadmit that the white hair bothered me a little ; but all at once I recognised my\nmother, smiling at me with the same smile that she had when on this earth.\n. . . I should further add that it matters not to whom I show this photo\ngraph ; everybody sees between us a resemblance which was frequently\nobserved in life.\"\nThe difficulty of trusting to recognitions is yet further increased by\na curious piece of evidence that came out at the Buguet trial. A\nphotograph had been taken by Buguet, which \" M.A. (Oxon.),\" before\nBuguet's detection, speaks of as (Human Nature for February, 1875,\np. 82) \" perhaps the most remarkable spirit-picture with which I am\nacquainted.\" . . . \"The face is the thoroughly developed face of a\nliving man, every feature distinct, more so, in fact, than the faces of the\nsitters.\" A copy of the photograph accompanies \" M.A. (Oxon.)'s \"\narticle, so that all can see for themselves how clear it is. The process\nof photographing was carefully watched by the sitters,1 and this spirit\nphotograph was recognised by several persons as the likeness of a\nMonsieur Edouard Poiret, who died at Pimprez (Oise) twelve years\nbefore.2 But this same photograph was also recognised by a M. Raymond\nas that of his father-in-law, still alive at Dreux, who was much\nannoyed at being sold about as a spirit before his time. M. Raymond\nhad taken steps to stop the sale of the photograph and gave evidence\non the subject at the trial. Now what happened in this case 1 Were\nM. Poiret and M. Raymond's father-in-law exactly alike, or were some\n1 Monsieur Carre\", Colonel d'Artillerie, said at the trial of Buguet : \"Nous avons\npris la plfique nous-memes ; nous l'avons vu mettre dans le chassis, que nous n'avons\npas laisse\" un instant ; en un mot, nous avons suivi et termini l'op^ration entifere avec\nle photographe ; . . . Buguet n'a pas opere\".\" (Procis des Spirites, p. 47.) M. Coohet\n(p. 54) says much the same : \"J'ai vu nettoyer la plaque; . . .. j'Stais derrifere\nles operateurs et aucun detail ne m'a ^chappe\\ Buguet ne prit part aux operations\nque pour mettre l'appareil au point.\"\n5 The evidence of several persons was brought to this at the trial. Thus M.\nBastian, aged 70, says : \"Or, j'ai parfaitement reconnu dans cette photographie . . .\nle portrait de M. Poiret, un de mes amis avec qui j'ai vecu pendant pres de trente ans.\"\n[Proces des Spirites, p. 55.) In his written testimony M. Bastian uses the expression,\n\" Avait une grande ressemblance.\" Others say, \" beaucoup de ressemblance,\" \" quel-\nque ressemblance \" (this was said by M. Poiret's nephew), \" a peu pres la ressem\nblance,\" \" reconnu ... la ressemblance \" (p. 177).\n\f282 [Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgvrick.\nof the witnesses mistaken in their recognition of this very definite\nlikeness 1 1\nOf course I do not mean to draw the inference that no evidence\ncould be obtained from recognition of spirit photographs. But I think\nthat we have not got, and that it is very difficult to obtain, evidence\nof sufficient quality and quantity to carry conviction, considering the\ncharacter of the photographers. For good evidence we must, in the\nfirst place, be sufficiently well acquainted with the witness to estimate\nhis recognition rightly. Secondly, we must be very certain that by no\nmeans could the photographer have acquired a knowledge of what the\nspirit photographed was like. Thirdly, we must be sure that the\nspirit was not like enough to the sitter for the portrait of the latter\ndressed up in spirit drapery to be mistaken for the spirit's. Fourthly,\nwe must have a sufficient number of likenesses clearly to exclude\naccidental coincidences like that of Monsieur Poiret.\nWe have still to consider the evidence for spirit photographs\nobtained without the presence of a professional spirit photographer.\nSeveral accounts of attempts to obtain them under these conditions\nhave been published.\nDr. Williams, of Haywards Heath (see Spiritual Magazine, Sep\ntember, 1873, p. 423 ; Human Nature, May, 1875, p. 200 ; Miracles and\nModern Spiritualism, p. 193), succeeded, after eighteen months' experi\nmenting, and exposing some hundreds of plates, in obtaining three plates\nwith what appeared a part of a human form, one of them having \" the\n1 There undoubtedly is a great deal of apparent evidence to recognition as regards\nBuguet\u2014especially in the correspondence abouthis photographs published in the Prods\ndes Spirites\u2014& great deal even after eliminating cases where only nine people out of\ntwelve recognise the likeness, or when some of those who ought best to know hesitate\nabout it. And there are one or two cases of scars, of attitudes, of bare places on the\nhead where a lock of hair had been cut off after death. One would like to see these\nphotographs and know how definite they really were.\nIt must be remembered that if one frequently sees a portrait of an absent person,\none's recollection is of the portrait, not really of the original, so that once a person\nhad clearly made up his mind as to the likeness, his recollection of the original would\nadapt itself. It is not, surprising, therefore, that the recognisers should not be shaken\nby Buguet's confession. As to the original recognition, cases like that of Poiret, and\ncases where the sitter does not recognise the portrait, but writes afterwards to say that\nseveral of his neighbours see in it a likeness of A. B. who died in his village some\nyears ago\u2014suggest that some of us are made sufficiently on the same model for it to\nbe possible to buy a ready-made portrait like ready-made boots, provided the scale be\nsmall; and it is observable that Buguet told M .Boyard (Prodsdes Spirites, p. 123) that\nfor large photographs '' il lui fallait de\"penser beaucoup plus de fluide ; que cela lui\noccasionait beaucoup de fatigue, et qu'il avait besoin apres d'un ou deux jours de\nrepos.\" Why this should be on the hypothesis of genuineness it is difficult to see,\nsince we cannot really suppose that the spirit makes itself up larger in order to be\nphotographed on a larger scale. But why, if it was all fraud, Buguet should prefer\ndoing small ones, is obvious.\n\fSupplement.] On Spirit Photographs. 283\nfeatures distinctly marked, the eyes and nose being very plain.\" On a\nfourth plate he perceived a well-formed figure of a man standing at the\nside of and looking at the sitter. He \" saw it distinctly for several\nseconds, and after examining it proceeded to strengthen it by further\ndeveloping, which,\" he continues, \" I succeeded in doing, when all at\nonce it faded away before my eyes, and nothing is now to be seen of\nit.\" It may, therefore, have been either a hallucination or an illusion,\nand I suspect that the three earlier ones were not beyond the range of\nsome accidental flaw resembling part of a human figure.\nThe following experience, of which we received the account only\na few weeks ago, may be compared with Dr. Williams's :\u2014\nMarch 15th, 1891.\nOne fine summer's afternoon in July or August, 1888, I decided to be\nphotographed in the small yard at the back [of the house] with my baby boy\non my shoulders. His mother, as you know, had died eighteen months\nbefore, leaving me a widower at 27 years of age, with a boy scarcely a\nfortnight old. I prepared the apparatus, focussed it, and instructed my\n'' buttons \" how to expose the plate and then took up my position with\nthe child crowing with delight as he occupied so prominent a part in the\naffair. In a few seconds the sun had done its share, whereupon I retired\nto the dark room to develop the \"picture.\" I was watching the plate,\nas I slowly agitated the solution it was in, with deep interest to see with\nwhat success we were to be repaid for the trouble, when suddenly there\nappeared before my startled eyes the form and lineaments of my dead wife !\nIt was there and then and has been ever since absolutely inexplicable. The\nvery idea was entirely unthought of and unknown to me. I had not then\neven heard of any such thing as spirit photography.\nHer portrait appeared just behind myself and child, between us and an\nivy-clad wall. It became clearer, and then slowly faded, though still dis\ncernible. When I had passed the plate through the hyposulphite of soda,\nwashed it, and took it to the daylight, the likeness was no longer traceable.\nAs a photograph it was wretched, owing to over exposure and the child\nhaving moved. Business occupations soon caused me to forget the incident\nand the plate was probably thrown away with other bad ones. Six months\nor a year after that Dr. P. was visiting me, and knowing he believed in spirit\napparitions I told him the above particulars. He was deeply interested in\nthe occurrence and asked me to seek for the plate. I did so, but never\nfound it. That is all.\nI was then, and still am, incredulous as to the power of spirits departed\nto reappear in a spiritual imitation of a material form, and am inclined to\nconsider the \"vision\" referred to above similar to those faces and forms\nthat I, for one, can see in nearly any wall paper of fantastic design, if\nso desirous.\nMr. Christian Reimers is quoted as having been successful in obtain\ning spirit photographs in private, but I have never seen any good account\nof them. \"M.A. (Oxon.)\" quotes in Human Nature, May, 1875, from Mr.\nReimer's account, but gives, I think, a wrong reference. If they are the\n\f284 [Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgwick.\nphotographs referred to by Mr. Reimers, in Prods des Spirites, p. 150, as\nI presume they are, they were, I think, \"done with Firman, a fraudulent\nand exposed medium, as sitter, and suggest the procedure described in\nConfessions of a Medium. I find a brief account of the experiments\nin the Spiritualist for May 15th, 1874, p. 238, quite insufficient as to\ndetails.\nMr. Thomas Slater, optician, of 136, Euston-road, obtained recog\nnised likenesses of dead friends, but he, again, has not, so far as I have\nbeen able to discover, published sufficient details to enable one to judge\nof the conditions under which they were obtained. He and his family\nwere, I believe, themselves mediums and required no extraneous assist\nance.\nM. Augustin Boyard (Ingenieur des Arts et Manufactures et\nChimiste, 104, Avenue de la Reine, a Bruxelles) says that he obtained\nat different times apparitions on plates, of which he had shown the\nbest to photographers and chemists without their being able to explain\nit. It could not come, they thought, \" d'une image mal effacee d'un\ncliche' anterieur.\" (Proces des Spirites, pp. 122-124.) He gives an\naccount of his experiments in the Revue Spirite for November, 1874,\nbut again, I think, a quite inadequate one. We have no proof that\na trick was not practised upon him, and the account seems to me to\n,suggest a considerable probability that it was.\nBut the series of experiments on which more stress has been laid\nthan on any other are those of Mr. Beattie, of Clifton. M. Aksakoff\nregards his results as the foundation-stone of the whole phenomenal\nregion of mediumistic materialisations in general and of transcendental\nphotographs in particular (Psychische Studien for May, 1886, p. 210),\nand Mr. Wallace calls them, in his article in the Arena, p. 143, \"per\nhaps the most remarkable series of experiments ever made on this sub\nject.\" Mr. Beattie, whom I have already mentioned more than once,\nwas a retired photographer who enjoyed, I believe, the respect of all who\nknew him. Disgusted with the evident signs of fraud in some of Hud\nson's photographs, he determined to experiment in the subject himself.1\nAccordingly, in 1872, he arranged with an intimate friend, Mr. Butland,\na good trance medium, to aid him in his experiments. Dr. Thomson and\nMr. Tommy also joined him. He \"next went to Mr. Josty, a professional\nphotographer, and arranged with him for the use of his studio, glass,\ninstruments, and such assistance from himself \" as might be required.\n1 His accounts of his experiments are to be found in the Spiritualist for July 15th,\n1872, and in the BritishJournal ofPhotography,1872 and 1873, &n&theSpiritualMagazine\nforSeptember,1872,and November,1873. An account by Dr. Thomson is given by \"M.A.\n(Oxon.),\" in Human Nature, for September, 1874, but it is less full than Mr. Beattie's,\nand makes no mention of Mr. Josty, whose importance in these experiments has been\nunaccountably ignored.\n\fsupplement.] On. Spirit Photographs. 285\n(Spiritualist, July, 1872, p. 55.) Mr. Beattie tells us nothing about\nMr. Josty or what previous acquaintance he had with him.\nThe first day, in nine exposures, nothing of interest occurred. The\nsecond day, on the ninth exposure, an abnormal appearance developed\nitself, which they could not account for. Up to this time Mr. Josty\nhad laughed at the whole affair, but this appearance, Mr. Beattie tells,\nus, staggered him a little. On the third day an appearance presented\nitself which gradually changed and developed on successive plates.\nDuring one of the exposures, Mr. Josty, having uncapped the lens,\nsuddenly went into a trance, from which he awoke much frightened.\n\" After that took place, for the rest of the evening, he could not be\ninduced even to touch the camera or slide, he was so superstitiously\nafraid.\" The next day no results were obtained ; the next time\ntwelve exposures were made with no results, and at length, both Mr.\nJosty and Mr. Butland being entranced, Mr. Josty, after uncapping the\nlens, moved to join the sitters during the exposure ; on this occasion\na white figure came out in front of him, just leaving his head exposed.\nMr. Josty did not, he said, remember having placed himself among the\nsitters. After this, it seems to have been arranged that Mr. Josty\nshould sit with the circle, Dr. Thomson uncapping the lens. Mr.\nJosty described during three exposures fogs which came out aa\ndescribed, and Mr. Butland said on one occasion that he saw a figure.\nbefore him which duly appeared on the plate. At the next seance\nthere was only one result out of fifteen attempts ; and at the\nnext, strange flames, we are told, in each case minutely described by\nboth mediums as to number, position, and brightness during exposure.\nAt the last seance three exposures succeeded out of twenty-one. Mr.\nBeattie says that he himself did \" all the photographic manipulating,\"\nand that they \" closed every door from which there was the remotest,\nsuspicion of wrong getting entrance.\"\nIn 1873 the experiments were repeated \"along with the same\ngentleman and under the same conditions.\" The description published\nof this second series is less complete than the first, though the results,\nwould appear to have been more striking. This time, as before, the\nfailures far exceeded the successes. There were two mediums present,\npresumably Mr. Butland and Mr. Josty again. \" The medium next\nthe background, we are told, became entranced and then by his influence\nhe caused the other to pass into some strange, spiritual condition,\" from\nwhich description, in connection with what we are told about the two in\nthe account of the series of 1872, I infer that the second was Mr.\nJosty. He used to describe during the exposure the appearances\nwhich were ultimately found on the plates, generally strange lights of\nvarying shapes, developing through a series of three or four exposures.\nOn one occasion he said \" it rose up and over another person's arms,.\n\f286 [Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgwick.\ncoming from his own boot,\" which seems a pretty definite placing of it.\nOn another occasion one medium said he saw a black figure and the\nother a light one. Both appeared on the plate but rather faintly, the\nlight one indefinite in form.\nThe result of the two series consists, I believe, of thirty-two success\nful photographs, but of these I have only seen sixteen which are repro\nduced in Psychische Studien for April, 1886, and in M. AksakofF's\nAnimismus und S]nritismus. The figures on these are vague splotches\nof light, such as it appears to me might have resulted from some method\nof letting light fall on the sensitised plate through a crack or chink of\nsome sort. One of these looks rather like a dragon, and some have\nforms vaguely resembling the human form, but so vaguely that one feels\nthe resemblance might well have been accidental. If we can suppose\nthat Mr. Josty was deceiving the others, these vague figures are just\nwhat it would probably be easiest for him to produce ; and as the room\nand apparatus used were his, and as it is clear from Mr. Beattie's\naccount that the camera and plates were not kept out of his hands\naltogether, it is most important to know whether he was a man who\ncould be completely trusted. We accordingly made inquiries at Bristol\nthrough an Associate of the Society residing there, who wrote on January\n27th, 1886: \"I have tracked Josty to the workhouse, a natural and\nfitting conclusion to his career, according to all accounts. He had long\nbeen going down hill ; was drunken, insolvent, and in money matters\nquite unscrupulous, having still many unpaid debts about here.\" Under\nthese circumstances, deceit by Mr. Josty appears to me to be too probable\na hypothesis to make it possible to attach much importance to Mr.\nBeattie's experiments as evidence of spirit photography. It is true\nthat the description given beforehand by Mr. Josty, and sometimes by\nMr. Butland, of the position and number of the figures counts for some\nthing evidentially. But if Mr. Josty was playing tricks he would\nnaturally have some information as to this ; and we do not know that\non the comparatively rare occasions when Mr. Butland mentioned\nthem he did so without suggestion from Mr. Josty.\nI have still to speak of one series of experiments, that of Dr. N.\n\"Wagner, Professor of Zoology at St. Petersburg, made in 1881, and\ndescribed in Psychische Studien for May, 1886, and in M. Aksakoff's\nAnimismus und Spiritismus. Professor Wagner was making experi\nments in the hopes of proving a theory of his that when a person is\nhypnotised a psychical self can separate itself and assume a form\nwhich, though invisible, can be photographed. He was entirely\nunsuccessful in this, but in the course of the experiments he obtained\non one plate (out of 18 taken under the same conditions) a white mark,\nresembling a hand with part of a full sleeve, some distance on the plated\nabove the portrait of the hypnotised sitter, Madame de Pribitkow.\n\fSupplement.] 287\nOn Spirit Photographs.\nThe resemblance to a hand at once strikes everyone who sees the\nphotograph, though it is very ill-defined and on more careful inspection\nis seen to be badly formed. The experiment is more carefully de\nscribed by the persons present than such experiments generally have\nbeen, though there is no indication that the accounts were written at\nthe time. From what we are told, taken in connection with the\nphotograph itself, of which a reproduction is given by M. Aksakoff,\nit is almost impossible to suppose that any one concerned practised any\ndeception. Moreover, the camera was a stereoscopic one, and Professor\nWagner states that the same appearance showed itself on both\nhalves of the plate, so that it cannot have been due to a flaw on the\nplate itself or to an accident in developing ; it must, it would seem,\nhave been caused by light reflected from some external object and\npassed through the lens. Perhaps if the photograph were a better\none\u2014it was not sufficiently exposed and the definition is very bad\u2014we\nmight be able to discover what the object was ; and if we had both halves\nof the stereoscopic photograph (only one of which has been reproduced\nin M. Aksakoffs book) it might enable us to discover the position of this\nobject relatively to the medium\u2014whether, for instance, it could be an\naccidental reflection off something in the background. But in any case\nit must, I think, be held as more probable that a single photograph like\nthis is due to accident than to spirits, until more experimental proof\nof so-called spirit photography, produced under circumstances where\ntrickery is out of the question, is forthcoming.\nAppendix.\nIt should be mentioned that \"M.A. (Oxon.)'s\" belief in Buguet\nrested on evidence somewhat different in kind from any that has been\ndiscussed in this paper, and depending on a special experience of his\nown interesting enough to be worth describing here, though not, as I\nthink, leading to belief in Buguet as a legitimate conclusion.\nLikenesses of a living, but absent, sister obtained through Buguet\nby the Comte de Bullet suggested to \"M.A. (Oxon.)\" that he might\nobtain a spirit photograph of himself. He therefore arranged with\nMr. Gledstanes to go to Buguet's studio in Paris at a given hour to try\nfor this. (See Human Nature for March, 1875, p. 97, et seq.) Mr.\nGledstanes did so on January 31st, 1875, and the Comte de Bullet\nwas also present. No mention is made of precautions to prevent\nBuguet's knowing what was expected, but it is not stated that he was\ntold. Buguet had photographed \" M.A. (Oxon.)\" in London in July,\n1874. (See Human Nature for January, 1875, p. 13.) \"M.A. (Oxon.)\"\nwas at the time of the present experiment lying on his bed in London\n\f288 [Supplement.\nMrs. H. Sidgwick.\nin a state of deep trance. The following is his description of the\nresults obtained :\u2014\n\" On the first half of the plate first exposed appeared a faint and indis\ntinct image of my face. The features were barely discernible, but Mr.\nGledstanes has no doubt that they are mine. A second exposure . .\nproduced a perfect result. The first half of the plate contains a decided\nlikeness of me ; the second half one of an old man. . . . The portrait of\nme is quite unmistakable. . . . The form gives the idea of being smaller\nthan I am naturally, and the features are those of an entranced person.\"\nSo far there is no particular difficulty in accounting for the occurrence\nby fraud. But now comes the confirmation. \" M.A. (Oxon.)\" was at\nthat time in the habit of receiving communications by means of a\nvoice not audible to others, but appearing to come from a distance.\nOn the morning after the photographing, before he received any news\nfrom Paris, this voice informed him, and by automatic writing it was\nnoted in his book, that :\u2014\n\" Two exposures had been made . . . but only the second was impor\ntant. On the first half of the plate was a good picture of me as I appeared\npersonally . . . and on the other half the picture of the spirit who had\narranged and carried out the operation.\" 1\nHere, therefore, there are four correspondences between what \" M.A.\n(Oxon.)\" seemed to know about the thing, and what actually happened,\nviz.: (1) that there were two exposures, (2) the first unimportant, (3)\nthe second a good likeness of \"M.A. (Oxon.)\" as to its first half, and (4)\nwith another figure on its second half. If it be regarded as very\nimprobable that this amount of correspondence should occur by chance,\nwe shall have at any rate evidence of something like thought-trans\nference or clairvoyance. But I am not sure that it is beyond chance.\nIt was not uncommon to make two exposures, and that the first should\nbe a failure. Nor was it unusual to obtain a second figure. Still, the\nincident is undoubtedly interesting, and goes to support some other\nevidence that in the trance state \"M.A. (Oxon.)\" could become aware of\nwhat was happening at a distant place where his thoughts were.\nTo \"M.A. (Oxon.)\" himself the evidence afforded by this incident of\n1 Another peculiar incident occurred in connexion with this, which, however, does\nnot, I think, materially affect the question of the genuineness of the photograph. The\ninformation was further given to \" M.A. (Oxon.) \" that his spirit was after the photo\ngraphing taken to the rooms of a friend of his. And he learnt from the said friend\nthat at the hour in question \"he became powerfully impressed with the conviction\nthat I was near, or was about to enter the room. He looked round more than once,\nexpecting to see me, and the impression was so strong that he noted the exact time,\nand conveyed his impression to me the same evening, remarking that it struck him as;\ncurious, considering that his mind was occupied with other subjects.\" If the friend,\nwas unaware that \"M.A. (Oxon.)\" was engaged in any special manner at the time this\nlooks like a telepathic incident.\n\fsupplement.] On Spirit Photographs. 289\nthe genuineness of spirit photography is of a different kind. I do not\nconsider with my present knowledge that there is sufficient reason to\nconclude that his \" guides \" are external to himself ; but he firmly\nbelieves that they are external, that he has known them long and\ntested their veracity, so that to him what he seems to learn from them\ncomes with the strength of a friend's assertion. He believes that the\nphotograph was a genuine photograph of his \" double \" because his\n\" guides \" told him so.\nIT\n\f290 [Supplement.\nH. E. Wvngfidd.\nin.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\nThe'rapeutique Suggestive : son Micanisme. By Dr. A. A. Li\u00a3beault.\n(Paris, 1891.)\nDr. Liebeault's new book will be read with interest by all students of the\nsubject. It is almost entirely devoted to the therapeutic value of hypnotism,\nand is, of course, a most important contribution to the subject. The first\npart deals exclusively with hypnotism in its medical aspect, while the last is\ndevoted to the discussion of hypnotic phenomena.\nDr. Liebeault gives us a selection of cases which, we may suppose, are\ntypes of those with which he has dealt during his long experience, and which\nwill form a valuable index of the kind of cases in which hypnotism may be\ntried.\nWhile all will probably acknowledge that many forms of nervous disease\narise from a more or less disordered state of mind, it is somewhat startling\nto find that he believes that many organic diseases\u2014even cancer\u2014may arise\nfrom this source. He believes that disease may be produced by the mind\nbeing unduly directed to, or withdrawn from, the various organs of the body.\nHe assumes that in health the attention has a certain normal distribution, any\ndisturbance of which will produce a functional disturbance, and, possibly, an\norganic change in the part in question. This idea\u2014that health is maintained\nin this manner\u2014is so novel that it is scarcely possible to accept it at once ;\nand, indeed, in most cases of disease one finds no evidence of any mental\ndisturbance having originated it, so that there is much difficulty in accepting\nsuch disturbance as a cause which usually gives rise to diseases. In the pro\nduction of certain diseases, indeed, mental distress seems to have a large share\n\u2014e.g., in diabetes; but can anyone imagine that the disease is due to mal-\nattention, either conscious or unconscious, of the affected organs, or perhaps\none might say, in many cases, the disordered function 1 It seems, at present,\nat least premature to make dogmatic statements with regard to these points.\nDr. Liebeault then gives his results in a large number of cases treated by\nsuggestion. Many of them are most remarkable, but it would be out of place\nto give an account of them in these Proceedings. The most remarkable cases\nare, to my mind, those of amemia, of which he mentions 39 cases. Of these\nsixteen cases were radically cured, 4 probably cured, and the symptoms in 11\nothers were either alleviated or temporarily dispelled. Such a result appears\ntotally inexplicable with our present knowledge.\nHe gives a case which is interesting and also more or less noteworthy, as\nshowing a certain fallacy against which one must carefully guard. He\nattempted to cure a goitre by suggestion, and in this case the patient, after a\ntime, believed that the swelling had vanished, though, in reality, it remained\nunaffected. It has often struck me that when patients treated hypnotically\nsay they are getting better their improvement is really imaginary, though\n\fSupplement.] 291\nNotices of Books.\nthis result is by no means to be despised. Dr. Liebeault believes that this\ncase was really the result of a badly given suggestion, or of mal-interpreta-\ntion on the part of the subject ; but it is obvious that, in those cases where\nsymptoms are described by the patient, and whose disease cannot be demon\nstrated to the eye of the physician, such a result may very possibly occur.\nHe records an instance of drunkenness, in which the effect of alcohol was\ndissipated by self-suggestion. I have myself, on one occasion, apparently pro\nduced sobriety in a drunken man by first commanding him to sleep and then\nsuggesting that he was sober, and immediately waking him up.\nOne instance of acute mania is recorded as cured, and one only. It\nseems disappointing to find hypnotism, so far, so inefficient a remedy against\nserious mental disorder. The author has only once tried to hypnotise an\nidiot, and on one occasion a child, aged 12, who was more or less imbecile.\nHe failed in both cases, but is not at present inclined to believe that it is\nnot possible to hypnotise imbecile subjects.\nThe rest of the cases recorded, and there are a very large number,\nillustrate a large variety of kinds. One, a case of phthisis\u2014treated by\nsuggestion\u2014though, of course, not cured, yet became much better and\nstronger ; and this case is illustrative of one of the effects of hypnotic treat\nment, which must have struck all who have visited Nancy. I often noticed\nhow very cheerful many of the patients seemed, and to remove mental\ndistress is obviously not only of great service in diminishing suffering, but,\nas is well known, removes a hindrance to recovery in an immense number of\ncases. In fact it is not impossible that, if hypnotism came into vogue in this\ncountry, its main use would be to bring this about.\nTurning to the other subjects of which Dr. Liebeault treats, the most\nremarkable, and almost the most puzzling, chapter is on \" Zoomagnetism.\"\nDr. Liebeault wished to find out by a crucial test whether the so-called\n\"magnetised water\" had any real effect or no. He therefore tried it as a\ntherapeutic agent in infants, and made a series of control experiments with\nordinary \" unmagnetised \" water. I need scarcely say that he found no\ndifference between the two, but it is absolutely astounding to read that he\nfound both (when combined with suggestion of the most indirect and concealed\nnature) to act as real therapeutic agents. This was the case, it must be\nremembered, on infants only a few months old. He concludes that infants\nare susceptible to curative suggestion ; a view which is so important, as well\nfrom a scientific as a medical aspect, that it is much to be regretted that he\nwill be unable to continue his researches. The only objection which one can\nsee, is that it is conceivable that recovery took place in these cases simply in\nthe course of nature, and not owing to the treatment ; but some of the cases\nare so striking that this appears unlikely in the highest degree.\nIn the chapter on lucidity are recorded some experiments in clairvoyance\nand hypnotism at a distance. The latter deserves special notice on account\nof the extreme rarity of authenticated instances. Camille S. was the subject\nof experiments. She had been often hypnotised by M. Beaunis, and he it\nwas who first succeeded in inducing sleep at a distance in this subject. He\nconcealed himself in M. Liebeault's garden, and, after a trial of 18 minutes,\ninduced sleep in Camille at a distance of 29 metres. On another occasion\nDr. Neilson, who had never hypnotised her, tried the same experiment and\nU 2\n\f292 [Supplement.\nH. E. Wingfidd.\nfailed. M. Liegeois, who had frequently hypnotised her before, was able to\ninduce sleep in 8 minutes, when concealed in the same manner, and the sub\nject was apparently en rapport with him alone. In another experiment, M.\nLiegeois being in one room and Camille in another, at 24 metres' distance, the\nresult was negative, after 20 minutes' trial.\nThese results will, of course, be regarded differently by different in\ndividuals. Those who already believe in telepathy will see a fresh confirma\ntion of their views, while those who do not as yet see sufficient reason for\nbelief in its existence, and I must confess that I belong to the latter class, will\nwait to see this, and, of course, many other experiments of this kind repeated\nagain and again, under many different and absolutely strict conditions, before\npronouncing any opinion as to their meaning.\nThe instance of apparent clairvoyance, or, some will say, spirit message,\nis very curious, the message of the death of a friend being received by\nautomatic writing at the time of death. This case was sent by Dr. Liebeault\nto the Society for Psychical Research, and was published in Phantasms of the\nLiving, Vol. I., p. 293.\nIt is to be hoped that the book will be widely read by those who use\nhypnotism in their medical practice. It is no mere belief in the curative\npower of suggestion that 20 years' experience has given to Dr. Liebeault. It\nis an absolute conviction in the power of the mind over disease. \" . .\nUniquement en concentrant son attention sur l'idee d'etre gueri, Ton peut\ndevenir plus habile sur son organisme que le plus savant des docteurs avec\n1'immense materiels de fioles et de pilules, mis a sa disposition.\"\nTo Dr. Liebeault, who has just begun his well-earned rest and retirement,\nwe owe the fact thac hypnotism is seriously considered by the medical pro\nfession in the present day ; and we can only hope that in the interests of\nscience he will continue to make experiments. Especially is it to be hoped\nthat he will continue them in the direction of hypnotism at a distance, which\nhe approaches without a priori beliefs for or against its probability, being\nguided entirely by the results of his experiments.\nWe leave the book in the hope that it will not be the last from the pen of\nthe father of modern hypnotism.\nII. E. Wingfield.\nDie Geisterhypothese des Spiritismus und seine Phantome. Von Eduard\nvon Hartmann. (Leipzig : W. Friedrich. 1891. Pp. 126.)\nThis work is the third stage of a controversy which has excited great\ninterest in Spiritist circles. Mr. Myers's review of AksakofFs Animismus\nund Spiritismus, in Proceedings XVII., p. 665, will be fresh in the memory of\nmembers of the Society ; and it will be sufficient to recall briefly the facts.\nVon Hartmann, in his first tract, Der Spiritismus (1885, not 1888 as obviously\nmisprinted in Mr. Myers's article) undertook to show that, even accepting\nthe evidence given by Spiritists as correct, all the phenomena thus attested\ncould be explained by the assumption of a \" nerve-force \" exercised by the\nmedium, together with thought-transference, induced hallucinations, and\nclairvoyance, reaching at times even to communication with the source of all\nknowledge in the Absolute. He thus maintained that the hypothesis of the\nagency of external spirits was at best but a fifth wheel to the cart, and not\n\fSupplement.] 293\nNotices of Books.\nadmissible as an explanation of the facts observed. AksakofPs book was a re\nply, arguing first, that the supposed \" nerve-force \" would not give a natural\nexplanation of the alleged phenomena of materialisation ; and secondly, that\nthought-transference and induced hallucinations would not explain the cases\nin which messages had been given, which transcended the limits of possible\nknowledge on the part of the mediums themselves and their sitters.\nOf the contest fought under these conditions I agree with Mr. Myers\nthat Aksakoff has the best of it. Von Hartmann's assumption of the nerve-\nforce which issues from the body of the medium, and then proceeds to set up\nfresh centres of force in all neighbouring objects, animate and inanimate\u2014\neven, as he suggests, in the particles floating in the air of the room\u2014while\nit still remains under the control of the medium's unconscious will, is, at least\nunder the present conditions of physics, as unprovable as the theory of\nAksakoff, that the spirits can make for themselves temporary material\norganisms out of the matter of the medium's body, and can use it as\nthe spirit of the living man uses his own body ; one theory can hardly\nbe considered more \"transcendental\" than the other. Both contestants\nadmit, however, that these physical phenomena cannot under any circum\nstances afford any positive proof of the existence of the spirits of the\ndeparted ; both agree that such proof can only be found in the establishment\nof the individuality of the \"spirits \" as revealed by the intellectual contents\nof the messages which profess to come from them. It is only this part of\nthe discussion which can be considered to have any immediate practical\nimportance for those who are endeavouring to approach the question on firm\ngrounds of evidence rather than of a priori theory ; and it is to this portion\nof von Hartmann's book that I propose to confine myself. When physical\nphenomena and materialisations are supported by a mass of evidence in any\nway comparable to that which has been collected for thought-transference and\ntelepathy, it will be worth while to look into physical theories of nerve-force.\nMeantime, to those who cannot accept, even as a basis for debate, the\ntestimony which passes muster among Spiritist believers, the discussion of\nthese questions seems to be little more than a beating of the air.\nIn his analysis, on the other hand, of the possibilities which have to be\ntaken into account before we can satisfy ourselves that any particular piece\nof knowledge could not have been in the medium's mind when the message\ncontaining it was given, von Hartmann is clearly nearer the truth than\nAksakoff. He has no difficulty in showing, for instance, that the cases\nquoted by the latter, where messages were given which were contrary to the\nconvictions or character of the medium, prove nothing ; for such an opposi\ntion between the upper and lower consciousness is now a familiar fact, and\nsusceptible of experimental proof by means of hypnotism. When we come\nto deal with phenomena which show a different mental level between the\ntwo the question becomes more difficult, though essentially analogous. But\nhere von Hartmann makes one remark which seems to be of wider bearing\nthan he himself indicates. He is speaking of an alleged case where a girl\nwho had never learnt music wrote down notes and played them upon the\npiano. In playing the piano it is necessary that there should be practice ;\nthat is, a training of the automatic functions, bringing about a molecular\nchange in the brain, presumably the establishment of lines of communication\n\f294 [Supplement.\nW. Leaf.\nbetween various sub-cortical centres. Until the nervous organism is thus\nmodified, the brain will not work at the suggestion of any mind, whether of\nthat which ordinarily dwells in it, or of an external mind which may suc\nceed in taking temporary possession. \"Through a nervous system unprepared\nby practice, even the most powerful spirit could no more produce a correct\nand clean performance on the piano than it could bring clear chords out of a\npiano with strings missing and out of tune \" (p. 34). Such a case, therefore,\nremains inexplicable on any hypothesis, and is no support to the supposition\nof the interference of external minds.\nThis applies with equal force to the accounts of speaking in tongues\nunknown to the medium, and, perhaps in a somewhat less degree, to the\nmany alleged cases of handwriting recognised as that of the departed. It\nseems important to keep in mind this preliminary difficulty, which separates\nall such cases from those where it is merely the content of the messages, and\nnot their form which lies outside the range of the medium's powers. If the\nevidence for speaking with tongues were better than it is, it might be worth\nwhile to consider how far the hypothesis of auditory hallucination might\nexplain it. If in cases of telepathic nature it sometimes happens that the\ntelepathic impact clothes itself in audible words, though in itself consisting\nprobably only in the suggestion of an idea, it might be conceived that in\ncases like that of Mr. Evangelides,1 the idea only of the medium's message\nwas suggested to him, and that its expression in Greek words was no more\nthan his own hallucinatory translation of it into thinkable form. It is\ncertainly remarkable that in every case quoted by Aksakoff where a conversa\ntion was held by the medium with a foreigner in his own tongue there seems\nto have been no one else present who spoke the language as a native and\ncould thus act as a check upon the possibility of hallucination. In Mr.\nEvangelides' case we have only his own assurance that the language\nspoken was Greek. Among the many defects of the evidence on this head\nit may be noticed that we are in no case told whether the medium spoke\nwith the accent of a native or a foreigner ; and yet this is evidently a point\nof cardinal importance for the whole question.\nPassing from hence into the region of facts which have a large amount\nof evidence to support them, the region of communications whose contents\nwere certainly not in the conscious knowledge either of the medium or of any\none present at the time, von Hartmann's assumptions certainly form a wide-\nsweeping net for the capturing of all possible knowledge. The validity of\nmany of them, most readers of the Proceedings will perhaps be prepared to\nadmit ; thought-transference between the medium and sitters, induced\nhallucinations, the unbounded retentiveness of the \"subliminal\" memory,2\n1 Mr. Evangelides was introduced to Miss Laura Edmonds, and held a conversa\ntion in Greek with her, in the course of which he was told that one of his sons was\njust dead. A letter confirming the statement came some days afterwards. Judge\nEdmonds givea the assurance that his daughter did not know a word of Greek. Here\nthe reading of the telepathic message and its clothing in speech form two essentially\ndisparate problems.\n2 Von Hartmann rightly insists upon the last of these, which Aksakoff seems to\nhive much under-estimated. The phrase \" hyperesthesia of memory,\" however, seems\nto connote a morbid state, and is hardly suitable.\n\fSupplement.] 295\nNotices of Books.\nall these have received more or less experimental confirmation. Between\nthem they will account for the reproduction of anything that was over in\nthe mind of anyone present. Nothing of which this can be predicated can\nbe safely ascribed to the action of any spirit of the departed. A further\nsource of mundane knowledge is added if we accept telepathy. Here the\nevidence is not experimental, and stands on a lower plane. Von Hartmann,\nhowever, not only accepts it, but is prepared to take the further step, and\nadmit clairvoyance in the most extended sense ; a power in the human\nmind of entering into the knowledge of the Absolute, where there is no\nlonger any past or future, but all things are in the present. If this be once\nadmitted it is clear that there is no further room for the hypothesis of\nspiritual aid in the presenting to us any knowable fact whatever. But the\nstep is a prodigious one, at least as hard to take as that to the belief in dis\nembodied spirits. Is it necessary 1\nTo me, at least, it seems that von Hartmann has been forced into it by\nunduly limiting the range of the powers which he has previously assumed.\nIn his first work he assumes that telepathic impressions are confined to the\nproduction of hallucinations, and so exposes himself to some telling retorts\nfrom Aksakoff. The assumption is entirely opposed to the evidence. The\ninstances collected in Phantasms of the Living no doubt show a great pre\nponderance of hallucination (Vol. II., pp. 22-24). But there is abundant\nevidence not only for hallucinations, but for all sorts of subjective effects,\nranging from mere malaise to the production of long messages in automatic\nwriting, and this von Hartmann might admit less hesitatingly than he does\nin the work before us. Again, von Hartmann thinks it necessary, in order\nto establish a case for telepathic impression, to find some special rapport, a\nspecial direction of the mind of the percipient towards the agent. This,\nagain, is not required by the evidence. In some of the cases in Phantasms\nof the Living the rapport was of the slenderest kind, occasionally, it would\nseem, consisting in no more than a familiar knowledge of the same locality\n(ii. , 265-289). And finally, von Hartmann seems to have overlooked the\nconsequences which result from the joint admission of the reality of telepathy\nand the infinite retentiveness of the subliminal memory. It can hardly be\ndoubted that those rare telepathic impressions which rise to the level of con-\nciousness are but a fraction of those which the under-self is continually\nreceiving. Yet each one of these must be stored up in the unconscious\nmemory, and be capable of reproduction under favourable circumstances.\nIf we further admit that the unconscious self is capable of handing on such\nimpressions, whether by telepathy or thought-transference, though they\nhave never risen to the level of consciousness, it seems that we have\nremoved all necessity for the assumption either of spiritual agency or of\nclairvoyance, when we have to deal with a piece of knowledge which may at\nany time have been in the mind of any living man. The assumption is,\nno doubt, a large one, in our present state of knowledge, but it is at least\non the same plane with others which are winning their way to acceptance ;\nand it must be fully considered before we pass away to an entirely fresh\nlevel of speculation, as we do when we assume either the agency of disem\nbodied spirits with Aksakoff or \"telephonic communication through the\nAbsolute \" with von Hartmann.\n\f296 [Supplement.\nW. Leaf.\nThere still remains a field which may in the end oblige us to take one of\nthese steps ; we may obtain good evidence of the communication of\nknowledge which was never in any living mind. Von Hartmann regards the\nforetelling of the future as the only \"chemically pure\" form of clairvoy\nance ; but even here it would seem that chemical purity must be restricted to\nthe cases, if any, where future events are foretold which do not depend on\nthe agency of human beings in the present ; for here there is always the\npossibility of a shrewd guess by the agency of simple thought-reading. Any\none who had the power of reading all his neighbours' thoughts in a conscious\nstate would have little difficulty in gaining a solid reputation as a prophet, if\nhe confined himself to obvious deductions from what he saw. But there is\nanother form of clairvoyance which seems almost, if not quite, as chemically\npure as the foretelling of future events. This is the discernment of objects\nexcluded from the range of ordinary sense perception, and removed from the\npossibility of knowledge of any human being by some method of purely\nrandom selection. The conditions of such an experiment are fulfilled, for\ninstance, in Professor Lodge's abortive trial to obtain from Mrs. Piper the\nreading of various letters of the alphabet in a closed box, means having been\nduly taken to exclude the knowledge of the letters chosen (Proceedings, XVII.,\np. 457). If that experiment had succeeded, it seems that nothing short of\naccess to some source of pure knowledge independent of human brains could\nhave explained the phenomenon.\nBut even granting clairvoyance, von Hartmann argues that it is in no\nway explained by the assumption of the intervention of the spirits of the\ndead. To suppose that death gives the power of foreseeing the future is to\nmake an assumption which is not only unproved, but absolutely unprovable ;\nwhereas the assumption that the minds of the living possess such a power,\nif true, is at least capable of proof ; and indeed there is already a certain\namount of evidence to support it. There is left, therefore, as a last support\nto the spirit hypothesis the vague test known as the recognition of identity.\nThis, from its nature, can never be more than subjective, and can convince\nno one but those intimately acquainted with the deceased ; and there can\nbe no doubt that these are the persons who are the most likely to be misled\nby illusion or hallucination, penetrated as they are by the desire to be\nbrought once more in contact with their lost friends.\nIn fine, then, I, for my own part, think that von Hartmann is assaulting\nthe Spiritist stronghold on right lines ; but his position seems to require some\nmaterial improvement in various points before it can be accepted either as a\nlogically successful reply to Aksakoff, or as a working hypothesis by which\nto examine the evidence. As a philosophical system it cannot as yet be\naccepted ; it is based far too largely on worthless testimony. This is, of\ncourse, done knowingly, and for a particular purpose ; and this purpose must\nbe held to have been fulfilled in having drawn from Aksakoff so sober and\nmoderate a statement of the Spiritist case. The controversy has unquestion\nably done much to clear the field, and has for the first time, perhaps, shown\nthe possibility of fair argument on common ground with believers in\nSpiritism.\nW.

And it\nseems to me that some effort at arrangement and generalisation is now\nmuch needed, were it only for the sake of aiding to direct experi\nmentation, which is at present, I think, apt to be concentrated on too\nsmall a portion of the widely-opening field.\nA few words may remind the reader of the stage which discussion\nin these Proceedings has already reached. In four papers, 1884-9, I\nhave discussed automatic writing, and cognate automatisms, and in the\nlast of these, Vol. V., p. 522, I sum up the results arrived at, and\nindicate that \" automatic writing is but one among a whole series of\nkindred automatisms,\" which are \"message-bearing or nunciative, inas\nmuch as they present themselves to us as messages communicated from\none stratum to another stratum of the same personality.\" I then\nendeavour to show that such messages may consist equally well of\nactive, motor automatisms, such as planchette-writing and trance-\nutterance, and of passive, sensory automatisms, such as hallucinations,\nvisual or auditory. I suggest that monitory voices, such as those of\nSocrates and Joan of Arc, may form an important class of such\nmessages from the subjacent Self. And I promise further discussion\non automatic picture-drawing, on trance-utterance, and on cases\nindicating the action in these messages of minds external to the\nautomatist's own.\nNow it so happens that almost every Part of the Proceedings\nwhich has since appeared contains matter bearing on one or other of\nthese points. The crystal-vision dealt with in Part XIV. (Vol. V.,\np. 486) introduces us to a passive mode of getting at pictures from a\nsubliminal source much more direct and effective than is the drawing\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 299\nof such pictures by the automatically-moving hand. The trance-\nulterances of Mrs. Piper (discussed in Vol. VI., p. 436, and to be\nfurther noticed) form by far the best specimens of that form of auto\nmatism which I can anywhere find. And the influence exercised upon\nthese messages by minds exterior to the automatist's own has been very\nfully discussed by Professors James and Lodge, Dr. Leaf, and Dr.\nHodgson. I have, moreover, printed some important cases of this\nclass in a supplement to my \" Defence of Phantasms of the Dead.\"\n(Vol. VI., p. 314.)\nIt seems, then, that, for the most satisfactory of reasons\u2014namely,\nthe inflow of fresh evidence from various quarters\u2014the continuance\nof my papers on \" Automatic Writing \" on the precise plan laid down\nis no longer appropriate.\nMy task has become at once in some ways simpler and in some\n,ways more difficult. It is simpler, in so far as much which was\naltogether denied and scouted when I began the argument has now\nfound general acceptance. The wide extension of hypnotic experiments\nin France and elsewhere has incidentally brought into common know\nledge certain facts not lying on the direct road of therapeutic inquiry,\nbut essential to the present argument. Thus it is now at any rate\nadmitted by all serious students that such a phenomenon as automatic\nwriting does actually exist ; that writing professedly obtained without\nthe writer's being aware of what he writes is not necessarily the product\nof morbid fancy or of semi-conscious fraud. And more than this; it is\nnow recognised (thanks largely to the work of Gurney in England and\nof Pierre Janet in France) that two or more distinct trains of memory,\nfeeling, will, may co-exist in the same personage, and may become\naccessible to us by artifices of various kinds. Thus much I can now\nassume as matter of common knowledge; and, so far forth, my task is\nsimpler than it was a few years ago.\nBut, on the other hand, the very fact that there are now so many more\nobservations to be co-ordinated increases the complexity of the inquiry.\nFor the hypothesis which I have already elsewhere briefly proposed,\nand which I shall now have to amplify, aims at nothing less than the\nprovisional co-ordination of all these subliminal phenomena. I hold\nthat both that group of facts which the scientific world has now learnt\nto accept (as the hypnotic trance, automatic writing, alternations of\npersonality, and the like), and that group of facts, for which in these\nProceedings we are still endeavouring to win general scientific accept\nance (as telepathy and clairvoyance), ought to be considered in close\nalliance and correlation, and must be explained, if explicable at all, by\nsome hypothesis which does not need constant stretching to meet the\nexigencies of each fresh case.\nI demur on this ground to the explanations thus far proposed by\nx 2\n\f300 F. W. H. Myers.\nFrench savants, whether of the Paris or of the Nancy school, which seem\nto me in different ways insufficient. The Nancy school, as is well known,\nuse the word suggestion as though this were in itself an explanation of\nthe way in which the phenomena are produced, instead of a mere\ndefinition of the artifice which the operator uses in order to produce\nthem. Insisting\u2014and I believe with perfect truth\u2014that hypnotism\nis in no way a morbid phenomenon, but is producible in sane and\nhealthy men, they nevertheless seem hardly to think it needful or\npossible to inquire how it comes to pass that a sane man's psychical\nbalance is capable of being thus suddenly disturbed. With the\nexception of Professor Delboeuf (not precisely a member of the\nNancy school), to whose ideas we shall hereafter recur, I know of\nno writer who, starting from the dictum that hypnotism is not morbid,\nhas even shown that he feels the need of explaining how a group of\nphenomena so extraordinary can spring by natural outgrowth from the\nphysiological and the psychical life of man.\nThe Parisian school have in some sense evaded this difficulty ; but\nat the cost of a cramping assumption which is now hardly accepted\nanywhere beyond the radius of Salpetriere influence. They boldly\naffirm that hypnotism is itself a disease,\u2014or at least that its phe\nnomena are morbid incidents which may be developed in the course of\nhysteria and other nervous degenerations. Having so said, they are in\na sense absolved from further explanation. They are bound, indeed,\nto show that these phenomena form some regular pathological series,\u2014\nresemble in some way the course of a real malady. Their attempts to\ndo this\u2014to produce a classical type of hypnotism, with definite stages\nbrought on by different stimuli\u2014have not produced conviction in\nthe scientific world outside. And their primary assumption, \" Only\nthe morbid can be hypnotised,\" is perpetually coming into more and\nmore unpleasant conflict with notorious fact. It now needs to be\ndefended by the bold and simple argument that the Nancy subjects,\nfor instance, must be hysterical because, as Dr. Babinski says, \"They\npresent in the hypnotic trance contractures, paralysis, anre'sthesia, all\nthe symptoms of hysteria. Now, suggestion alone would be unable to\nprovoke the appearance of these physical symptoms. Suggestion has\nacted as a revealer of hysteria.\" 1\nThis argument hardly proves Dr. Babinski's case, since it assumes\nthe very point in dispute, i.e., that certain phenomena, known to\noccur in hysteria, cannot be producible by other causes as well. But,\nnevertheless, it suggests a question which the Nancy school have made,\nas I have said, but little attempt to answer. How is it that this easy\n\"suggestion,\"\u2014which in itself, one would think, can have little more\n1 Dr. Babinski, in Revue de VHypnotisme, July, 1891, p. 24.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 301\nefficacy than the mere utterance of a charm\u2014can often at once pro\nduce effects which years of medical and surgical treatment would fail\nto secure ? Nay, and not only therapeutic effects, of a kind which\nordinary medicine can at any rate aim at, but profound modifications\nof nervous condition\u2014-changes whose mechanism we are entirely un\nable to understand ?\nSo long as we try to explain all the phenomena of hypnotism,\ndouble consciousness, &c, as mere morbid disaggregations of the\nempirical personality\u2014repartitions among several selves of powers\nhabitually appertaining to one alone\u2014so long, I think, shall we be\ncondemning ourselves to a failure which will become more evident\nwith each new batch of experiments, each fresh manifestation of the\nprofundity and strangeness of the subliminal forces at work. We\nshall find ourselves, so to say, explaining the action of a group of\ngeysers on the assumption that they are springs fed by the ordinary\nrainfall.\nI will ask the reader, then, to bear in mind that in what follows I\nam not attacking any recognised, caherent body of scientific doctrine.\nRather, I am making a first immature attempt to bring some kind of\norder out of a chaotic collection of strange and apparently disparate\nobservations. My hypothesis\u2014developed here from briefer indications\nin earlier papers\u2014cannot possibly, considering the novelty of the\ninquiry, be true in all details. But it may be of use at least in\npointing out the nature and the complexity of the problems which any\nvalid hypothesis must recognise and solve.\nI suggest, then, that the stream of consciousness in which we\nhabitually live is not the only consciousness which exists in connection\nwith our organism. Our habitual or empirical consciousness may\nconsist of a mere selection from a multitude of thoughts and\nsensations, of which some at least are equally conscious with those that\nwe empirically know. I accord no primacy to my ordinary waking\nself, except that among my potential selves this one has shown itself\nthe fittest to meet the needs of common life. I hold that it has\nestablished no further claim, and that it is perfectly possible that other\nthoughts, feelings, and memories, either isolated or in continuous\nconnection, may now be actively conscious, as we say, \" within me,\"\u2014\nin some kind of co-ordination with my organism, and forming some\npart of my total individuality. I conceive it possible that at some\nfuture time, and under changed conditions, I may recollect all ; I may\nassume these various personalities under one single consciousness, in\nwhich ultimate and complete consciousness the empirical conscious\nness which at this moment directs my hand may be only one element\nout of many.\nBefore we draw out the implications of such a statement, let us\n\f302 t\\ W. H. Myers.\npause to consider the obvious reasons which a man may give for\nconsidering his empirical consciousness as identical with his total self.\nThe first remark of the ordinary reader will probably be that if\nthere were in fact any other consciousness within him, he would\ncertainly be aware of it.\nThis, however, is simply to beg the question. We must reply that\nthe dicta of consciousness have already been shown to need correction\nin so many ways which the ordinary observer could never have\nanticipated,\u2014the world of realities (so far as we can get at any\nintelligible notion of it) is so utterly unlike what our empirical\nconsciousness suggests to us,\u2014that we have no right to trust our con\nsciousness, so to say, a step further than we can feel it ;\u2014to hold that\nanything whatever\u2014even a separate consciousness in our own organism\n\u2014can be proved not to exist, by the mere fact that we (as we know\nourselves) are not aware of it.\nBut dropping this first untenable demurrer, a man may still give\ntwo reasons, which look valid enough, for supposing that there can be\ncomparatively little psychical action going on within him of which he\ncannot give an account. He may say, in the first place : \" The deeds\nwhich I have done in life\u2014the movements which my body has made\u2014\nhave been executed in obedience to the will of my conscious self. There\nhas been no room for the operation of any imaginary will in the back\nground.\" And, in the second place, he may add: \" Besides this active\nlife there has, of course, been a passive life as well. Besides the sensa\ntions and movements originating in my own frame, there have been\nsensations and movements impressed upon me from without. But all\nthis, though I could not control it, I can nevertheless remember. I can\nfeel sure that nothing of importance has happened to me which I\ncannot recall by voluntary act of recollection. Here again, therefore,\nthere is no room for the operation of an imaginary memory beneath\nthe threshold. In short, to put the matter in a nutshell, I receive my\nletters at my front door, and I give my orders in my library. Why\nshould I suppose that my house is governed by an imaginary conspiracy\nin the kitchen?\"\nNow I need not examine how far contentions like these would be\nvalid if we kept to the realm of pure philosophical speculation. For\nwe happen to be able to prove, by actual and easy experiment, that\nthey are entirely inconclusive.\nIn the first place, it is now well known that very often if a man\nin the hypnotic trance be ordered to perform a certain act after\nhe has been awakened\u2014to execute, as it is called, a post-hypnotic-\nsuggestion\u2014he will execute that suggestion, in complete unconscious\nness of having received a command, and in the full belief that he is\nacting from his own choice, and with complete freedom of will.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 303\nI have already repeatedly dwelt elsewhere on the deep significance\nof this easily verified fact. It is enough to show that a man's belief\nthat his acts have been willed by his ordinary conscious self is no proof\nwhatever that they have primarily been so willed. They may have\nbeen primarily willed by some subjacent stratum of his being\u2014as in\nthe case of the post-hypnotic suggestion\u2014and may yet appear to his\nsupraliminal self as absolutely of its own choosing.\nAgain. The chain of memory of which our superficial self is\nmaster, and which in common parlance is spoken of as extending over\nthe whole past life, is seen on closer inspection to be imperfect and\ninterrupted in a high degree. For all men it omits the periods of\ninfancy and of sleep ; for many men there are further gaps representing\ndelirium, hypnotic trance, and various disturbances of consciousness.\nAnd here again hypnotic experiment has made all the world\nfamiliar with a fact which, until recent times, could only have been\ninferred from a few scattered instances. This fact is that not only\nmay these gaps in our superficial memory possess a chain of memory of\ntheir own, but that such secondary chain of memory is actually in some\nsense more continuous than the primary.\nWe all know that the hypnotised subject as a rule remembers\nwaking life, but that the awakened subject as a rule has wholly\nforgotten the events of his hypnotic trance. The full significance of\nthis fact\u2014which has hardly yet, I think, been realised in any quarter\n\u2014will appear more clearly as we proceed. For the present it is enough\nto point out that this fact alone destroys any possible claim of our\nprimary memory to be our sole memory, and thus shows us that we\ncannot rest upon our empirically conscious memory any more than upon\nour empirically conscious will as indicating that the empirical self to\nwhich these belong is in any way a complete expression of our being.\nWhat, then, is the practical conclusion to be drawn as regards the\nmode of conducting our present inquiry 1 It is simply this : that we\nmust regard this ordinary stream of waking consciousness\u2014in which I\nwrite these words and my readers read them\u2014with just the same\nimpartial, objective scrutiny which we apply to the consciousness, say,\nof a person in spontaneous somnambulism or in hypnotic trance.\nIf we wished to form a judgment as to his activity of psychical con\ndition in such a trance, we should examine his sensory and motor\ncapacity, his intelligence, his memory ; and should note in what points\nthere was either diminution or increase of his known powers in waking\nlife. And this would be an easy task ; since we should be aiming only\nat describing state B\u2014the somnambulic state before us\u2014in terms of\nstate A, the ordinary waking condition.\nBut this\u2014although it is pretty nearly all that has been hitherto\nattempted in this direction\u2014stands to a complete experimental\n\f304 F. W. H. Myers.\npsychology in something the same relation that the digging a pit in\nmy garden stands to a knowledge of the earth's crust. I can easily\ndiscover that after digging (say) through a stratum of gravel I come\nto clay, and I can describe the clay as damper and less healthy than\nthe gravel. As a householder I may accept this stratum of gravel\nabove the clay as an ultimate and satisfactory fact. As a geologist I\nam bound to ask what it all means. Why is the gravel on the top ?\nWhy is there clay below it ? What is there below the clay 1 Do the\nstrata always occur in the same order, or must the gravel at any rate\nalways be on the top ? I can no longer say, \"My house is built on\ngravel,\" as though that were all I need know. It is built upon an\nunknown number of strata, of which, for an unknown reason, the\ngravel is uppermost at this particular point.\nNow I maintain that the prevalent French mode of treating these\nsubjacent psychological states\u2014although they have proved in more than\none case capable of beneficially supplanting the superficial state\u2014as\nthough they were, nevertheless, mere morbid variations or splittings-up\nof the superficial state, resembles the reasoning of a man who should\nsay that the clay, or chalk, or granite which he found beneath the\ngravel was a kind of degenerate gravel\u2014an agglomeration of particular\nelements in the gravel, but nothing really new.\nI think that the time has come for a rather deeper investigation.\nI think that we have now observed enough out-croppings of subjacent\nstrata to enable us at least to seek\u2014I do not say as yet to find\u2014some\nsort of provisional Law of stratification which does not assume as a\nprimary truth that because gravel is the stratum on which we have\nchosen to build our houses, gravel is therefore the normal type which\nought always to be uppermost, and of which all other minerals are a\ndegenerate modification.\nNot so; phenomena of so far-reaching a significance as these demand\na wider purview than the mere pathologist's in those who would explain\nthem. They open questions as to man's psychical being which have\nalways been deemed to lie inter apices philosophies. We shall not get\nat their true meaning if we discuss them only in the atmosphere of a\nhospital-ward full of hystero-epileptics. There will be need, of course,\nto verify any hypothesis as strictly as we can ; but we must not fall\nback upon hypotheses manifestly too narrow because we despair of\nbeing able as yet to submit wider conceptions to exact proof.\nThe hypothesis which I offer may be attacked, I fear, with some\napparent reason, from two opposite quarters\u2014both as antiquated and\nas revolutionary. Its central conception is ancient enough. The idea\nof a soul which precedes and outlasts the body, and which retains\nmemories, or receives intimations, belonging to a world in which the\nbody does not dwell\u2014this assuredly, whether as religion or as philo\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 305\nsophy, as revelation or as speculation, has been one of the dominant\ntenets of the traditional Wisdom of the Past.\nBut on the other hand, that so-called wisdom has never either\nappealed to, or been recognised by, the rival wisdom of modern\nphysiology. There is something unpleasing to many minds in the\nmere attempt to deduce from these quasi-hysterical phenomena an\nargument for man's higher destinies. To the savant such a juxta\nposition suggests charlatanism ; to the philosopher it savours of\ndegradation.\nThat task must, nevertheless, be attempted. Yet it will be well to\navoid the use of terms which, like the words soul and spirit, carry with\nthem associations which cannot fairly be imported into the argument.\nSome word, however, we must have for that underlying psychical\nunity which I postulate as existing beneath all our phenomenal\nmanifestations. Let the word individuality serve this purpose ; and\nlet us apply the word personality, as its etymology suggests, to some\nthing more external and transitory\u2014to each of those apparent char\nacters, or chains of memory and desire, which may at any time mask\nat once and manifest a psychical existence deeper and more perdurable\nthan their own.\nFor such is my hypothesis. I suggest that each of us is in reality\nan abiding psychical entity far more extensive than he knows\u2014an\nindividuality which can never express itself completely through any\ncorporeal manifestation. The Self manifests through the organism ;\nbut there is always some part of the Self unmanifested ; and always,\nas it seems, some power of organic expression in abeyance or in reserve.\nNeither can the player express all his thought upon the instrument, nor\nis the instrument so arranged that all its keys can be sounded at once.\nOne melody after another may be played upon it ; nay,\u2014as with the\nmessages of duplex or of multiplex telegraphy,\u2014simultaneously or with\nimperceptible intermissions, several melodies can be played together;\nbut there are still unexhausted reserves of instrumental capacity, as\nwell as unexpressed treasures of informing thought.\nAll this psychical action, I hold, is conscious ; all is included in an\nactual or potential memory below the threshold of our habitual con\nsciousness. For all which lies below that threshold subliminal seems\nthe fittest word. \"Unconscious,\" or even \"subconscious,\" would be\ndirectly misleading ; and to speak (as is sometimes convenient) of the\nsecondary self may give the impression either that there cannot be more\nselves than two, or that the supraliminal self, the self above the\nthreshold,\u2014the empirical self, the self of common experience\u2014is in\nsome way superior to other possible selves.1\n1 I here use the word \"self\" as a brief descriptive term for any chain of memory\nsufficiently continuous, and embracing sufficient particulars, to acquire what is\n\f306 F. W. H. Myers.\nI hold (to continue) that this subliminal consciousness and sub\nliminal memory may embrace a far wider range both of physiological\nand of psychical activity than is open to our supraliminal conscious\nness, to our supraliminal memory. The spectrum of consciousness, if\nI may so call it, is in the subliminal self indefinitely extended at\nboth ends.\nAt the inferior, or physiological end, in the first place, it includes\nmuch that is too archaic, too rudimentary, to be retained in the supra\nliminal memory of an organism so advanced as man's. For the supra\nliminal memory of any organism is inevitably limited by the need of\nconcentration upon recollections useful in the struggle for existence.\nThe recollection of processes now performed automatically, and need\ning no supervision, drops out from the supraliminal memory, but may be\nin my view retained in the subliminal. To this point we shall again\nrecur. In the second place, and at the superior or psychical end, the\nsubliminal memory includes an unknown category of impressions\nwhich the supraliminal consciousness is incapable of receiving in any\ndirect fashion, and which it must cognise, if at all, in the shape of\nmessages from the subliminal consciousness.\nTo this category I refer telepathic and clairvoyant impressions,\nwhich I believe to be habitually received, not by aid of those sensory\nadits or operations which the supraliminal self directly commands, but\nby aid of adits and operations peculiar to the subliminal self, and fall\ning under some system of laws of which supraliminal experience, if\nstanding alone, could give us no information. And I believe that some\nof those impressions which, though in no clear way connected with\nsight, we include under clairvoyance, do in some sense transcend the\nlimitations, of time as well as of space, within which all supraliminal\nconsciousness necessarily falls.\nVarying our metaphor, we may say that the range of sensation\ncovered by our supraliminal consciousness or memory resembles\nthe range of temperature covered by our ordinary thermometers. The\nthermometer's range represents but a small segment of the temperatures\nwhose existence in the Cosmos is implied by the very nature and con\nstitution of the planet on whose surface our short range of tempera\ntures prevails. Even so our supraliminal consciousness, with its\nshort range of sensation and memory, is, I think, demonstrably\nbased upon, demonstrably implies, a consciousness of wider scope.\nThat wider consciousness, again, may conceivably extend from the\nabsolute zero, or point\u2014wherever that may be\u2014where no conscious\nness has yet begun, up to a point of expansion where it may transcend\npopularly called a \"character\" of its own. There will thus be one distinct supra\nliminal self at a time ; but more than one subliminal self may exist, or may be\ncapable of being called into existence.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 307\nany analogy which we can employ. For just as we know of no superior\nlimit to heat, unless it be that point where, in consequence of the com\nplete dissociation of matter, the energy which we call heat must change\nits character in some unknown way, so also we know of no superior\nlimit to consciousness, unless it be that point where individual con\nsciousness, individual memories, may be merged in some vaster and\nunknown form of life.\nThere may thus be, in my view, an unknown amount of psychical\noperation proceeding in our individuality, and in connection with our\norganism, of which operation only a small fraction habitually rises\ninto the cognition of the empirical self. What shall so rise, and what\nshall not so rise, may well have been originally determined by some\nprocess of natural selection.\nThe matters of which we are superficially conscious have been\nselected from among the matters of which we might have been con\nscious, much as the matters to which we attend are selected from among\nthe matters to which we might attend. I must needs attend to the\nvoice of one who calls to me ; I may leave unattended to the buzzing\nof a fly in the room after I am conscious of it. Even so, in a more\ngeneral way, my superficial self must needs be conscious of sounds\ntransmitted to me by air-waves, but may ignore messages which reach\nme by the less practical method of telepathic impact from other minds.\nIn each case the object of the selective process may have been the\npreservation of the race and of the individual. When another object is\nproposed, the selective process may take another form. And in fact the\nobject of civilised men has now considerably altered its character. It\nis knowledge, not mere self-preservation, at which we aim. We may,\ntherefore, hope that just as many matters rise into, say, the naturalist's\nattention which the hunting savage has not perceived, so also many\nmatters may now be made to rise into our superficial consciousness\nwhich our purely practical ancestors could in no wise reach.\nIt will be seen that I do not suppose that there is any definite\nor impassable barrier between the various strata of the Self. They are\nstrata (so to say) not of immovable rock, but of imperfectly miscible\nfluids of various densities, and subject to currents and ebullitions\nwhich often bring to the surface a stream or a bubble from a stratum\nfar below.\nBut observe that so soon as this is understood\u2014so soon as I admit\nand assert that the existence and nature of subliminal capacities in\nthe self is to be inferred only from actual phenomena observed and\ninterpreted by that empirical self by whose aid science does her work\n\u2014so soon does my theory lose its air of mysticism, and ranges itself\namong hypotheses which may be erroneous, but are not plainly un\nscientific.\n\f308 F. W. H. Myers.\nIt is my object to test that theory by all the facts at my command.\nAnd perhaps it will tend to clearness if I begin by pointing out what\nkind of phenomena we may logically expect to find, if the theory be\ntrue, and if I then go on to show to what extent I can claim that the\nphenomena actually observed correspond to my anticipation.\nAnd first, perhaps, it may be well to deal with the question of\nmorbidity, of abnormality, which is so prominent in many men's minds\nin connection with any messages from the subliminal consciousness.\nNow assuredly I do not hold that the subliminal self is free from\n,disturbance and disease, any more than the supraliminal. \" The\nSubliminal Self \" is a name for an aggregate of potential personalities,\nwith imperfectly known capacities of perception and action, but none\nof them identical with the assumed individuality beneath them, nor\nentitled to share in any kind of \"imperturbability, indiscerptibility,\nincorruptibility,\" which the philosopher may ascribe to an incorporeal\nsoul. There must needs, therefore, in my view, be subliminal disturb\nances, and these must needs make themselves felt in the supraliminal\nbeing. How shall we distinguish these subterranean from the superficial\nstorms? How shall we recognise, for instance, a disturbance of the\n\" hypnotic stratum \"\u2014as we may style for convenience' sake that group\nof potential perceptions and reactions which are readily evoked in a\nsuitable subject by the hypnotic trance? It would be absurd to attempt\nto explain ignotum per ignotius,\u2014the Eetiology of disease by its relation\nto hypothetical strata of the subliminal self. But one remark I must\nmake, since, crude as it may be, it offers at least a chance of light\nupon a subject at present hopelessly confused.\nI say, then, that our most plausible conception of a morbid disturb\nance of the hypnotic self would consist in a derangement of functions\nor capacities habitually observed in the hypnotic state, and in that\nstate alone. I should say that the reason for referring the source of\nsuch derangement to the hypnotic\"1 self would be increased if the sub\nject were, when hypnotised, aware of the exciting external cause of\nsuch derangements, and capable of modifying them in a way impossible\nto him in waking life.\nNow it is a striking characteristic of the hypnotic self that it can\nexercise over the nervous, the vaso-motor, the circulatory systems a\ndegree of control unparalleled in waking life. Told to hold out his arm,\nthe hypnotised subject will hold it out for an indefinite time in a state\nof painless contracture, and with no disturbance of pulse or respira\ntion. Told that the ammonia which is held to his nose is otto of roses,\nhe will inhale it with unwinking, unwatering eyes. Told that he has\nburnt himself in a given spot, his skin will redden or even form a\"\"'-,\nblister. Told to sleep, he will sleep profoundly until told to awake.\nI do not here attempt to explain why that obedience is rendered. But\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 309\nthe power of obeying such commands\u2014that is the function, the pre\nrogative, the secret of the hypnotic self.\nAre we aware in practice of any malady or group of maladies in\nwhich these functions, these capacities, are the subject of special dis\nturbance 1 Are there cases of prolonged and apparently causeless\ncontracture 1 Are there anaesthesias appearing, shifting, and disappear\ning as rapidly as the suggested anaesthesia of hypnotism 1 Are there\nanomalous vaso-motor disturbances, which seem to follow the patient's\nmere caprice 1\nThe reader will answer with the word hysteria. And, meaningless\nor misleading though that term be, it is in fact our first and obvious\nreply. Not indeed all, but almost all the phenomena which can be\ninduced by suggestion in the hypnotic state occur spontaneously in\nhysterical patients.\nBut this will not complete our answer. From the point of view of our\npresent analogy the differentia of hysteria will be simply an irrational\nself-suggestion in regions beyond the power of the waking will ;\u2014a\nmorbid or uncontrolled functioning of powers over the organism which\neffect profounder modifications than the empirical self can parallel.\nThus the production of patches of anaesthesia or analgesia is a-\ncharacteristically hysterical symptom, and it implies a power of modify\ning the sensibility to touch or pain which we cannot imitate under\nordinary conditions.\nBut when hysteria is thus regarded, it is seen that several other\nmaladies fall under the same category. \" Attaques de sommeil,\"\n\"association-neuroses,\" \" Zwangs-Vorstellungen,\" and a host of mono\nmanias show a similarly morbid functioning of precisely that class of\npowers which hypnotism exhibits to us in harmless or beneficent opera\ntion. They are self-suggestions of an irrational and hurtful kind. They\nare diseases of the hypnotic stratum. Hypnotism is not a morbid state ;\nit is the manifestation of a group of perfectly normal but habitually\nsubjacent powers, whose beneficent operation we see in cures by\ntherapeutic suggestions ; whose neutral operation we see in ordinary\nhypnotic experiment ; and whose diseased operation we see in the\nvast variety of self-suggestive maladies.1\nI would offer this view to the consideration of those who justly\nrealise the close connection between hypnotism and hysterical pheno\nmena, but mistakenly endeavour to force all the hypnotic phenomena\ninto the hysterical category.\n1 The self-suggestive psychoses pass into insanities dependent on organic lesion\nby gradations on which physicians themselves are hardly agreed, and which lie quite\noutside my province. I do not, of course, mean to assert that delusions unmodifiable\nby suggestion, and depending on actual lesions (as the megalomania of general\nparalysis), belong to the hypnotic more than to any other stratum of personality.\n\f310 F. W. H. Myers.\nM. Babinski, for instance, as we have seen, argues as follows on\nbehalf of the Salpetriere view that all hypnotic subjects are hysterical.\nThe Nancy subjects, he says, although asserted by Nancy doctors to be\nnon-hysterical, yet show in the hypnotic trance phenomena which we\nobserve elsewhere in hysteria alone. For that reason they must in fact\nbe hysterical. This, surely, is to reason in a somewhat obvious circle.\nAnd those who, with the great majority of competent judges, are con\nvinced that non-hysterical persons may most assuredly be nevertheless\nhypnotisable, must seek some other explanation for the similarity of\nphenomena in the two states. That explanation I have here attempted\nto give by suggesting that hysteria (and many cognate troubles) should\nrather be said to fall under hypnotism than hypnotism under hysteria.\nThose self-suggestive troubles exhibit the disordered working of a\nstratum of the self which is per se as normal and as essential to man's\ncompleteness as any other, and which surpasses the superficial stratum\nin the degree of power which the will informing it can exercise over\nthe organism.\nYet one word more to those who, without stigmatising either\nhypnotism or subliminal manifestations in general . as necessarily\nmorbid, are yet disposed to style them abnormal, and to regard them\nas a mere curiosity which can never be closely inwrought with human\nprogress.\n\" The normal man \" is apt, I think, to become as question-begging\nan individual in physiological as \" the natural man \" in theological\ntreatises. What is man's nature 1 and what is man's norm 1 If wo\nwere answering for any lower species we should undoubtedly say that\nthe norm of that species was such adaptation to its environment as\nbest secured its existence and its diffusion over our planet. Answering\nfor mankind, we should demur to this crudely propagandist view. We\nshould hesitate to assume that Brigham Young had fulfilled man's end\nand aim more successfully than Sir Isaac Newton. Man's end and aim\nare not so simple as a rabbit's; he must choose between ideals; he must\npursue the higher objects even at some sacrifice of the lower. And\nwhether we contemplate his highest aim under the aspect of Virtue or\nof Knowledge, we must agree that such aim can only be attained by a\nrise into fullest consciousness\u2014by a completest control and exercise of\n\" those high capacious powers which lie folded up in man.\"\nHitherto, indeed, almost all experimentation on human subjects\nhas been directed to practical, to therapeutic ends ; to the remedy of\nthe wear and tear which interfere with the every-day working of the\norganism. Approached even on this merely practical side, that organ\nism has shown itself at once far more complex and far more modifiable\nthan the early physicians supposed. But we have found, too, that for\nsuch modification we need quite unlooked-for artifices\u2014appliances\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 311\nwhich it has taken centuries to perfect, and of which Hippocrates and\nGalen did not dream.\nThus much for one side of man's nature. How as to the other 1\nPsychological experiment is still, as it seems to me, at much the\nsame point as was medical experiment in the days of Hippocrates.\nWe are still in the stage of mere logical and descriptive analysis of\nthe psychical nature with which we have to deal. We have scarcely\nyet invented any instruments for probing or artifices for modifying it.\nNay, the very idea of trying to modify our psychical selves by\ndeliberate scientific experiment is as foreign and unacceptable to most\nmen as the idea of modifying his death-rate by sanitation is to the\nAfrican savage. There is in most of our minds a vague assumption\nthat our race stands at its highest point, and that any change must\nimply degeneration.\nNo one, of course, can offer scientific defence of such an assump\ntion as this. Yet how great would the difference be if it were altogether\nousted from every mind ! If it were admitted that we are borne\u2014\nhowever slowly\u2014on an ascending curve, and that we can assign no\nnecessary limit to the powers over our own personal mind and matter,\nand over mind and matter without us, which we may be able to exert\nwhen we have gained fuller consciousness of all that lies hid within !\nThe foregoing remarks, I trust, may have cleared the way for an\ninquiry on which we ought to enter unfettered by any prejudice against\nthe unknown within us simply as unknown. We have now briefly to\nconsider what kind of phenomena should be observable if our theory\nis a true one ; in what fashion we can suppose that a subliminal realm\n,of psychical action such as I have assumed will be likely to make\nitself perceptible to the superficial consciousness. Such tentative\n-answer as we can give to this question may at least help to show us\nfor what phenomena we are bound to be on the watch.\nIf, then, there be in each of us an undefined pre-existing potency\nof sensation, thought, and will, which can at best manifest itself but\nirregularly and imperfectly through the bodily organism, we shall\nexpect that each mode of perception of which the superficial self is\ncapable will be from time to time made use of by the underlying\nintelligence. There will be a transmission of messages (so to name any\nkind of manifestation, be its purport true or false) from the lower\nto the upper strata, in all modes of which the upper strata are\naccustomed to take cognisance. And since we must not assume that\nthe subliminal self is necessarily confined to the special modes of\nsensory communication which the supraliminal self enjoys, we may\nanticipate that in these upward-passing messages there will be indica-\ncations of some such wider or less differentiated perceptivity as we\nmay suppose to be operative in the depths of our being.\n\f312 F. W. H. Myers.\nNext as to the contents of these messages. In the first place, we\nshall have absolutely no reason to anticipate that all the messages will\nbe wise or important. Although I call them messages, for the sake of\na general term, and because they all convey some sort of knowledge of\nwhat is passing beneath the threshold, yet we must not assume that\nthey are necessarily purposive or voluntary. They may, as in dreams,\nbe the expression of some purposeless and involuntary subliminal\nactivity ; or, as in hysteria, of some subliminal activity of a distinctly\nmorbid kind. Or, without actual disease, they may communicate sheer\nerror, sheer folly, sheer wickedness. It is not likely that any stratum\nof our being, even though it have some directer access to wisdom, is\nitself entirely wise.\nNevertheless, my initial hypothesis will assuredly not be justified\nunless we can discover a certain proportion of subliminal messages\nwhich do actually communicate truths of which the superficial self was\nnot otherwise aware, or effect ends which the superficial self could not\notherwise effect. And such messages\u2014veridical in content, or bene\nficently self-suggestive in operation\u2014ought, in my view, to be seen\nflashing out along the whole spectrum of superficial consciousness, and\nalso (as already implied) beyond either end of that habitual spectrum.\nBeyond the inferior or physiological end of that spectrum, we ought\nto find traces of a beneficent power over physiological processes which\nare not within the control of the supraliminal will. Coincidently\nwith that spectrum we ought to find traces of a completer than the\nsupraliminal memory, of a keener than the supraliminal sense-perfec\ntion, of a sounder than the supraliminal judgment. And beyond the\nsuperior or psychical end of our metaphorical spectrum we ought to\nfind traces of a knowledge subliminally acquired by methods unknown\nto the supraliminal self, and from sources to which that self has no\naccess. How far such supernormal powers may extend we cannot, of\ncourse, predict. But we shall anticipate that whatever supernormal\npowers are discovered will be discovered in the subliminal and not in\nthe supraliminal realm ;\u2014will reach the superficial self in the form of\nmessages whose source and whose mode of composition will be discerned,\nnot directly, but inferentially ;\u2014will be subject, not to the laws of the\nknown molecular world, but to laws of that unknown world in which\nthe specific powers of the subliminal self are assumed to operate.\nSuch, roughly speaking, will be our anticipation as to the modes, and\nas to the content, of subliminal manifestations. We shall have some\nwhat similar grounds for preliminary conjecture on other points, and\nnotably as to the probable relation of subliminal messages to the supra\nliminal memory.\nBut this point we will for the present defer. Our subject is so com\nplicated that we shall gain rather than lose by an arrangement which\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 313\nbids us at times to retrace our steps, and to grow familiar with our\nlabyrinthine way.\nLet us, therefore, turn now to the actual messages, and let us\narrange them in the first place according to their different modes of\nmanifestation, the channels through which they reach the superficial\nself. We shall find that the observed cases fall broadly into four\ncategories :\u2014\n1. First come messages neither definitely sensory nor definitely\nmotor, but consisting of vague or anomalous impressions or impulses.\n2. Secondly, we have messages mainly sensory, or passive automa\ntism.\n3. Thirdly, we have messages mainly motor, or active automatism.\n4. Lastly, we have messages at once motor and sensory, which tend\nto occupy the whole psychical field, and to pass on into states of trance,\nor of alternating personality.\n1. The first of these classes\u2014theoretically, perhaps, the most\ninteresting of all\u2014must be very briefly touched upon here. The\ntime has not come for its full discussion\u2014can hardly come until we\nhave a greater mass of skilled and careful records of subjective feeling.\nNothing is harder to describe than these vague impressions which\nseem to lie beneath the foundations of ordinary sensation and ordinary\nmotion alike. The student of our published narratives will note in\nhow many different ways this difficulty is felt and met\u2014how inadequate\nare our \" matter-moulded forms of speech \" to express some unique\nexperience which is often even more impressive to the percipient from\nits own strangeness than from the message which it carries.\nOne point, however, needs clear recognition. These subliminal\nmessages seem very often capable of being developed with equal ease\ninto impressions of sight or into impressions of hearing, or into motor\nimpulses. Let us take the case which is so often the simplest\u2014that\nof a post-hypnotic suggestion. If a vague suggestion, say of danger,\nis conveyed to several hypnotised patients, to be developed after\ntheir awakening, each will realise the hallucinatory danger in a\ndifferent way ; voice of enemies\u2014smell of fire\u2014sight of a wild beast\nadvancing ; it is a chance which sense is used to express the dominant\nidea. The idea suggested will rise into manifestation by whatever\nchannel the \" psychostatical \" condition of the subject may render\neasiest at the moment.\nSomewhat similar is the case with many veridical hallucinations.\nThey begin with a vague feeling which is neither sight, sound, nor\nmotion ; then they develop gradually into a phantom, a voice, an\nimpulse to writing or to utterance. If the same person has several\nsuccessive experiences, these will often tend to clothe themselves in the\nsame sensory shape.\nY\n\f314 F. W. H. Myers.\nThe importance of this fact is seen when a claim is put forward\nthat an apparition, if veridical, is necessarily also objective\u2014has some\nindependent reality outside the percipient's brain. Not so, we reply ; in\nmany cases that manifestation has developed so gradually, so unmis\ntakably from within, that we cannot logically deem that an objective\nfigure was suddenly intruded into a series of impressions so plainly\nsubjective in its first inception. As well say that while the hypnotised\nboy was straining his ears to catch the angel's music there suddenly\ncame to him the real note of a heavenly harp.\nI am not maintaining that all veridical hallucinations are of this\nprimarily subjective type. I have elsewhere argued, indeed, that the\nterms objective and subjective lose in some of these cases all clear\nmeaning, and that in the case of a collective hallucination, for example,\nwe can often do no more than record the experience of each person\nconcerned, being absolutely unable to say on what laws the collectivity\nof the hallucinatory experience could possibly depend. But, never\ntheless, it is the obscure internal origin, rather than the sudden flash\ning out, as though upon an external organ of sense, which is the most\ninstructive characteristic of these subliminal messages. The flash, no\ndoubt, may often be all that we can observe ; but the question is what\nhas heated to flashing-point the inflammable parts within.\n2. We thus pass onwards, without sudden transition, from obscure\nindefinite messages to definite sensory messages,\u2014full-blown hallucina\ntions. And here we cannot say what determines the development or\nleads to the increase of definition in the message received. It is not\nnecessarily, I think, a great intensity of the message ; for the vague\nmessages may be prolonged and disturbing ; the visual or auditory\nhallucinations may be unexciting and transient. But be they of what\nquality they may, it is important to realise that all hallucinations of\nthe senses may be in some sort messages from the subliminal self.\nThey may be so when merely fantastic just as truly as when they are\nveridical.\nDreams form at once the weakest and the commonest form of\nsensory hallucination. And dreams, of course, already give manifest\nsigns of having been manufactured below the threshold of our ordinary\nconsciousness. Sometimes, as I have pointed out elsewhere (Con-\ntemporary Revieiv, February, 1885), a single dream seems to involve\nmore than one level of subliminal consciousness. And already in\ndreams\u2014even in meaningless and fantastic dreams\u2014we begin to come\nacross signs of intensified power. The occasional prolongation of\ndream-figures into the first waking moments seems to indicate that an\nintensity of visualising power has been exercised in the dream which\nthe waking subject could not imitate. And these hypnopompie\nillusions, if I may so term them\u2014illusions which attend the departure\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 315\nof s eep\u2014are paralleled by the hypnagogic illusions which attend the\non-coming of sleep, and which have been described by Maury and other\nauthors.\nIt is well known that at or near the moment of falling asleep,\nscenes or faces will sometimes present themselves with a startling vivid\nness which no voluntary effort can rival. Very likely other bad\nvisualisers, besides myself, have derived from these occasional flashes\nsome notion of the good' visualiser's habitual capacity, which otherwise,\nas being beyond imagination, might have remained for lis beyond belief.\nThe lesson, then, of these illusions hypnagogiques is that even in the\nshallowest and most meaningless messages from the subliminal self there\nmay be indications of previously unknown capacity. Nay, this is the case\neven when the subliminal messages are directly originated by disease.\nIn delirium tremens the type of the hallucinatory figures is determined\nby the nature of the disease, and by previous associations. But the\nvividness with which that type is realised is in itself an indication of\nintensified capacity. The patient, when in ordinary health, could\nnot summon up pictures of rats or snakes with anything like that\nvividness and reality which so terrify him now. With other deliriums,\nalso, the case is similar. The vivid illusions of the opium-eater and\nof the haschisch-eater are notorious.\nNow in most of these cases it is the morbid element which has\nusually attracted attention. The vivid visions have been looked upon\nas symptoms of poisoning, to be removed as soon as possible. But to\nthe psychologist these visions have an interest of a much deeper kind.\nJust as it is the business of the physician to look out for degenerations\n\u2014to avert dissolution\u2014so it should be (though it has not often been)\nthe business of the psychologist to look out for extensions of capacity\n\u2014to recognise evolution. And these morbid visions take on a new\nimportance if they are regarded as indications of a power of visualisa\ntion, of combination, of invention, existing in subliminal strata of our\nbeing, and accidentally revealed by the volcanic upheaval of fever.\nWe may extend this argument to cases where there is no fever, but\nthe indication of disordered function lies in the hallucination itself.\nThe most rudimentary, in one sense, of all forms of visual halluci\nnation is the recurrence of an after-image. The microscopist has been\ngazing long and steadfastly at some tiny network of cells. Laying\naside the microscope, he feels nothing unusual. But perhaps some\nhours afterwards the network will start up before him in an objectified\nform, so clearly that he may again study forgotten details. Now this is\nthe result of unduly prolonged attention , it is a morbid stereotyping of\nimpressions which should pass swiftly away. But although it is thus on\nthe whole a retrogressive or dissolutive phenomenon, it has a progressive\nor evolutive aspect as well. It indicates, that is to say, the possession\ny 2\n\f316 F. W. H. Myers.\nof an intensity of faculty previously unknown. No one could have\nasserted that so exact an image of the microscopic object was still\npreserved in the observer's brain ; nor could he himself have evoked\nsuch an image by conscious effort.\nSomewhat similarly we find that sudden vivid revivals of memory\nor faculty in dying persons are explained by physiologists as indicating\nthat when any nervous centre is discharged with disintegrating violence\na number of stored-up memories are thus set free, which would never\nhave been evoked by the gentle discharges of healthy life.\nIn all these cases, as will be seen, my argument in no way prompts\nme to minimise the morbid characters. On the contrary, I hold that\nsince we possess certain subliminal faculties, which at present we can\nonly get at by a variety of empirical methods, it was antecedently\nprobable that disease would be one of these methods. It is likely, of\ncourse, to be a wasteful and incomplete method; bearing something the\nsame relation to experiment that a volcanic eruption bears to the\ndigging of a mine. Yet it may bring to us a certain amount of con\nfused knowledge as to subjacent strata\u2014a knowledge which it is our\nbusiness to make definite by properly directed excavation.\nBut here an objection will be raised to my argument,\u2014so serious\nthat, at the cost of some delay, I must endeavour to forestall it.\n\" You have no right,\" my critic will say, \" to extract evidence of some\nnew subliminal capacity from phenomena which, like the hallucinations\nof delirium tremens, are obviously the mere concomitants of nervous\ndissolution. In such cases we have the uncontrolled irregular working\nof such of the higher nervous centres as have so far escaped paralysis\nfrom the alcoholic poisoning.1 You must not treat defect of inhibition\n,as if it were a positive power. In all our sense-organs there is a\ncertain margin of capacity beyond what we habitually use. This\nmargin renders possible many helpful adaptations to new difficulties ;\nbut also it inevitably admits of wasteful outpourings when control is\nremoved. Take a case of purely mechanical trouble. Say that too\nmuch wax accumulates in my ears. My reserve of auditory capacity is\nnow called upon, and I hear fairly well in spite of the obstruction.\nThe surplus wax, however, is removed;\u2014and straightway I hear my\nfriend's voice as a shout, and his cab like rolling thunder. Do you call\nthis an uprush of subliminal capacity ? The fact simply is that my\n,ears, which had adjusted themselves to special difficulties, take some\nlittle time in readjusting themselves to ordinary circumstances. It is\nas simple a matter as my feeling your study hot when I come in out of\nthe cold air.\"\nThis is all true, I reply ; but my first object is precisely to discover\n1 Sea Dr. Huglilings Jackson in Journal of Mental Science, April, 18S7.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 317\nwhat margins of capacity our known sensory centres possess ;\u2014in the\nhope of discovering whether we have other capacities not dependent\nupon the senses that we know. And we must not class all these mani\nfestations of latent capacity together ;\u2014they are of many kinds, and\nteach many different lessons.\nThe case of intensified hearing, for instance, tells me comparatively\nlittle. I believe already that some of my ancestors could hear more\nacutely than I ; and my reserve power in this direction could indicate\nat most that degrees of capacity once acquired do not always die out\nwith disuse (like sight in cave-fishes), but may remain latent, and\nready for some descendant's special need.\nBut, on the other hand, I see no reason to suppose that my\nancestors could visualise\u2014could call up imaginary images\u2014any better\nthan I can. If then by drinking brandy I succeed in visualising a\nhallucinatory rat, I have come upon a degree of faculty which I had\nno previous reason to suspect myself of possessing. That faculty, let\nus say, has arisen incidentally during the development of my visual\ncentres. It has been a useless bye-product of human evolution.\nBut note that the more useless, irrelevant, episodic, incidental such\na bye-product is, the more significant is it for our present purpose.\nBye-products such as these do not follow on the incoherent action of\nsuch organisms as man can himself construct. A loom is a man-made\norganism ; it is a product of artificial selection, of modifications imposed\nfrom without, with no spontaneous variations arising within. Throw\nit partly out of gear and it will perhaps work violently; but there will\nbe no method in its madness ; its incoherence will be absolute ; it will\nnot incidentally turn out patterns more complex than any which it has\npreviously made. You will find out nothing about it which you did not\nknow before ; for there is nothing in it which you did not put there\nyourself. But, on the other hand, when you disarrange the human\norganism by alcohol you get something more than incoherence ; not\nonly tossing movements and vague cries, but also the projection of\nphantasmal figures, more vivid than the patient's healthy imagination\never produced.\nAnd note that this very power of externalising visual images has in\ncertain cases (a well-known story of a portrait-painter is copied from\nbook to book) been of actual artistic value to its possessor. It is a\nbye-product of the same general type as musical and mathematical\ngenius;\u2014those \"gifts\" whose brilliance and strangeness have prompted\nMr. Wallace's suggestion that they may have been introduced into the\nhuman mind, or fostered there, by some agency like that of a breeder\nor gardener, outside of the normal course of evolution. I do not\nclaim that the drunkard's \"blue devils\" have any supernatural source.\nBut I would suggest that if ever we are to learn whence those \"sports \"\n\f318 F. W. H. Myers.\non which natural selection so largely depends have originated, and what\ntheir possible range may be, we can only find this out by analysing\nwhatsoever within us lies off the main track of self-preserving and\nrace-preserving adaptation. Explain to me, I would ask, not how\nMithridates came to have a family at eighty, but how Gauss came to\ndiscover the method of least squares at eighteen.\nMan's life on earth starts from an x of some sort ; and for my\npresent argument it matters not whether you call x a carbon-atom or\nan immortal soul. Whatever it was, x had certain potentialities,\nwhich must have dated in any case from some age anterior to its\nexistence upon our recent planet. Theories of evolution have taught\nus something of the ways in which x may have been modified during\nits terrene existence; but we have yet to learn what that was on which\nearth's forces began their play. Are there indeed any residual pheno\nmena, bye-products of evolution, useless vestiges, enigmatic rudiments,\nwhich if once we could interpret them could carry us back beyond\nprotozoic life to some more ancient history, some more perdurable\nlaw?\nIt will be seen as I go further that there are certain facts which\ncan, I think, throw light on this problem ;\u2014which strongly countenance\nthe hypothesis of a pre-existing, an informing, a surviving soul. In\nthe meantime the necessary logical arrangement of my matter places\nmy argument at a disadvantage. For I have to begin with small and\nscattered observations, themselves explicable on hypotheses narrower\nthan mine, and needing,\u2014to show their true connections, their con\ntinuous trend towards the stranger, the supernormal phenomena,\u2014a\nwide ingathering and long cumulation which neither my space nor my\nknowledge enables me here to offer.\nBut I must content myself with thus appealing to my reader to\nstudy the whole series of my facts before he dismisses my interpreta\ntion. For the present I must return to my immediate topic, and\nmust continue to trace in order the various classes of visual hallucina\ntions\u2014from the morbid or fantastic up to the veridical, and even to\nthe collective class.\nNext above the visual hallucinations of disease I should place those\nwhich many persons can summon up by the empirical process of gazing\nat a crystal, dark mirror, or other clear surface. These \" crystal-\nvisions\" appear to run parallel to the whole range of visual hallucina\ntions. Some of them closely resemble dreams ; appearing to be mere\ncasual modifications of past experience. Others, again, exhibit a super\nnormal revivification of past events\u2014a hypermnesic character\u2014on which\nwe shall hereafter have to dwell. In other cases the vision seems to\nhave a telepathic origin. In others, again, the crystal shows a message\npurporting to have come from a deceased person. In others, again, it\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 319\nshows scenes apparently depicting the remote past, or the future, and\nnot clearly traceable to any individual intelligence. Nor can we at\npresent discriminate by any difference in the characteristics of the\nvision itself what its origin or its meaning may be.\nI need hardly say that in using the convenient term \" crystal-\nvisions \" I am not attributing any real importance to the crystal or\nother speculum used, nor even assuming that it is always needful to use\na speculum at all. The important point is that by use of empirical\nmeans, which vary with different persons, a good many observers can\nsucceed in inducing visual hallucinations in a harmless and convenient\nform. The crystal-visions seem akin to the faces and other forms seen\nin the dark by many persons while fully awake.1 It is natural at first\nto suppose that the crystal-seers are slightly self-hypnotised by the\nsteady gaze ; and in some instances this is probably the fact. But in\nsome of the best marked cases of crystal-vision which I have seen\nthere is no indication whatever of modification of the normal waking\nstate.2 Crystal-vision in my view is not a branch of hypnotism,\nbut rather an additional method\u2014due, like hypnotism, to accidental\ndiscovery\u2014of bringing into the cognisance of the supraliminal self\nsome part of the processes which are ceaselessly going on below.\nFurther experiments on crystal-vision are much needed. But the\ncases already published will serve to show that these visions may rise\nfrom very different depths in the psychical being\u2014may come only \" from\ndreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell,'' or may be fashioned by\nsomewhat within us which is cognisant of forgotten memories, and of far-\ndistant things. In one point nearly all observers concur. These visions\nimply a visualising power greater than the seer can exercise by volun\ntary effort. The distinctness and artistic quality of these crystal-\npictures can be estimated more truly than that of hypnotic, or even\nof post-hypnotic hallucinations, on account of the subject's more\nthoroughly normal state. And the illumination of the pictures, the\nmovement of the figures, often causes the seer great surprise. The\neffect is said to be not like that of \" conjuring up a scene,\" but rather\nof looking tranquilly into a camera obscura, where light and movement\nare given correctly, and with no effort of one's own.\nThe study both of hypnotically-suggested hallucinations and of\ncrystal-visions forms an important prerequisite for the right compre\nhension of that remarkable class which remains to be mentioned,\u2014the\n,casual or isolated\u2014falsidical or veridical\u2014hallucinations of the sane.\nReaders of Phantasms of the Living will remember how Mr. Gurney\nhas brought out the strong analogies which subsist between all phan-\n1 See Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., p. 473.\n2 See the paper, \" Recent Experiments in Crystal-Vision,\" Proceedings, Vol; V.,\np. 48(5.\n\f320 F. W. H. Myers.\ntasmal experiences of this kind\u2014between those which we must assume\nto be merely subjective, and those which we regard as having a tele\npathic origin, a veridical content. He has shown how beneath all\ndifferences both of aspect and of content they are wont to give indica\ntion of somewhat the same process of subliminal manufacture.\nBefore, however, we can decide to class all visual phantasms as\nmessages from the subliminal self, we must take into account the\nimportant fact that these phantasms are in many cases collective\u2014that\nthey are observed by several persons simultaneously\u2014perhaps even by\nanimals as well. Are we not bound, it has been asked, to regard such\ncollective phantasms at any rate as objective entities, in no way\ndependent upon the self of the percipient 1\nIn reply I would say (as I have said at greater length elsewhere),\nthat I see no objection to describing these collective hallucinations as\nobjective, so long as it is understood that their objectivity implies only\nthat they have a source outside the percipients' minds, and does\nnot imply that they are necessarily discerned by the percipients in\naccordance with ordinary optical laws.\nOur records of collective phantasms show at any rate that even\nwhen more persons than one perceive the phantasm it is not safe to\nconclude that all the persons present will perceive it. Nay, more; those\nwho do perceive it will sometimes perceive it to different extents\u2014one,\nfor example, hearing only ; another both hearing and seeing. It is even\ndoubtful whether the perceptions of the different percipients are in all\ncases fully consistent with each other, or do not rather indicate that\nsome initiating cause acts on each percipient in a manner determined\nby his own psychostatical condition. Collectivity, in short, is in such\npercipience more truly styled electivity. It may be the case that A and\nB, who are together, both see the same phantom ; but this fact gives us\nno guarantee that if C was there with them he would see the same\nthing.\nIt is clear, then, that a phantom thus electively perceived\u2014perceived,\nthat is to say, by one person in preference to another, equally well\nsituated\u2014cannot be perceived by the superficial self, according to\nordinary optical laws. Yet certainly in some instances the phantasmal\nimage, say, of a dying man, does affect in much the same way more\npercipients than one,\u2014and percipients of whom some may be strangers\nto the presumed agent, and so not likely to have received the impres\nsion from him by direct telepathic impact. To meet this difficulty it\nhas been suggested that when A is dying, and A's phantom is perceived\nby B and C, of whom C is a stranger to A, then B perceives it by\ndirect telepathic impact from A, and C by further or secondary tele\npathic impact from B. Where the difficulty is so great, and our know\nledge so small, we must not hastily reject any attempt at explanation.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 321\nBut, personally, I am led to think that there is, as I have elsewhere sug\ngested, some \" centre of phantasmogenetic activity,\" bearing some\nrelation to space, and affecting B and C simultaneously and directly.\nThe phrase here cited, in spite of its unavoidable vagueness,\nmay now be seen to possess an intelligible meaning. I have\nalready urged that the impulse which ultimately generates the\nphantom is in no case directly received by the superficial self, but\nalways by the subliminal faculties, in some unknown fashion. I have\nsuggested that this impulse is not in itself of any definite sensory or\nmotor quality, but is generally capable of being translated to the super\nficial self in either sensory or motor terms, according to the subject's\npsychostatical condition,\u2014perhaps according to the predominance of\nvisile, audile, or motile imagery in his habitual psychical operations.\nTo explain these collective or elective cases, with their similarities in\nthe general image but differences in detail, we should have, on this view,,\nfurther to suppose that the said impulse is sometimes of a kind which\naffects the subliminal self of all suitably constituted persons within a\ncertain area, and which, although modified in each observer's case by\nindividual conditions, has yet a prepotent tendency to translate itself\ninto one special form of imagery\u2014so that the phantom which each\nobserver perceives is similar, although not identical.\nDifficult as such a hypothesis may be, it indicates, I think, a more\nlikely road towards the solution of this crowning puzzle of collective\nhallucinations than is afforded by those who maintain that a phan\ntasm seen or heard by more than one person must be a real part of\nthe objective world ; so that failure to see or hear it would arise\nfrom some mere defect of eyes or ears\u2014some such purely physio\nlogical limitation as prevents some men from hearing the shrill cry\nof the bat.\nWhat has here been said of hallucinations of sight will apply,.\nmutatis mutandis, to hallucinations of the sense of hearing, and of\nthe sense of touch\u2014to the phantasmal sound of human voices, or\npressure of human hands. \" The sense of touch,\" however, is, of\ncourse, a mere popular term which covers a variety of classes of\nsensation as yet imperfectly known. At any rate the sense of contact,,\nthe sense of temperature, and (of course) the sense of pain are known\nto admit of being isolated as separate modes of perceptivity. What\nmessages, we may ask, does the subliminal self send upwards in con\nnection with these senses 1\nAs regards the sense of temperature the answer is complex and\nobscure, involving what seems to be a new group of sensibilities to>\nmagnets, metals, &c. An elaborate system of these supposed sensi\nbilities was drawn up long ago by Reichenbach in his book, Ber sensi\ntive Mensch, and similar systems have since been elaborated by Barety\n\f-322 F. W. H. Myers.\n<le Rochas, and others. In the absence of further corroboration all\nthese schemes must be considered as at least premature. Neverthe\nless, there is in France a growing belief that certain metals, even wrapped\nup or concealed, so as to avoid suggestion or hyperesthesia of ordinary\ntouch, do produce definite and unexplained sensations, among which are\nsensations of temperature, apparently not depending on the smoothness,\nweight, or other known property of the metals used. Thus a burning\nsensation from gold seems one of the commonest of these phenomena.\nThe sensations alleged to be felt from magnets fall under a kindred\ncategory. Professor Pitres in a recent work asserts that these results\nhave now been obtained with an electro-magnet, the percipient not\nknowing whether the current was turned on or off ;\u2014a precaution on\nwhich we have repeatedly insisted in these Proceedings.1 It is to be\nhoped that observers in other countries may soon be fortunate enough\nto find subjects equally sensitive.\nWhile we must accept the accounts of these experiments with due\nreserve as to possible effects of suggestion and self-suggestion, it does\nyet, I think, become yearly more probable that this influence of metals\n(ill-named by Pitres and others hap\/talgesia, since it is by no means\nalways painful) and this kindred influence of magnets do actually exist.\nAnd if such influence exists, it would appear to exist for the most part\nsubhminally; for it becomes perceptible by the superficial consciousness\nonly or mainly in conjunction with other phenomena which have a\nmanifestly subliminal initiation.\nIt\" seems, then, quite possible that we may here have a real approach\nto certain obscure physical laws by means of the help afforded by\nindications arising from a stratum within us in which the range of per\nception is, as I have already suggested, enlarged in divers unpredict\nable ways.\nAnd next as to sensibility to pain. In what relation does the sub\nliminal self stand to this prominent characteristic of our superficial\nbeing 1\u2014a characteristic originally acquired, we may suppose, for pro\ntective purposes, but now in many of its forms useless, and, when useless,\nnoxious, and even dangerous to life. We know, of course, that sensi\nbility to pain is one of the functions most easily modified by hypnotic\nor post-hypnotic suggestion. Painless operations \"in the sleep\" formed\nthe most impressive theme of the early mesmerists. Operations per\nformed in the waking state, but rendered painless by previous sugges\ntion during trance, are now equally familiar. The painless accouche-\ninents of which the hypnotic journals now report a pretty constant series\nfurnish some striking examples of the removal of pain while other\nsensibilities and energies persist undisturbed. Self-suggestion, too,\nHe does not, however, explicitly state that all danger of suggestion from the\nslight click which accompanies magnetisation was avoided.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 323\nwill with many persons relieve pain in a marked degree, as in the\nso-called \"Faith-Cure.\" Analgesia, moreover, seems generally to be\npresent in spontaneous ecstacy. And it is found in combination with\nhallucinations ;\u2014as when a sudden removal of pain follows upon a sense\nof phantasmal touch on the part affected.\nThus far we have been speaking of analgesia, as opposed to\nanaesthesia ; of the removal of the sensibility to pain but not of the\nsensibility to contact. I need not say that anaesthesia also is common\nin trance and in hysteria.\nA curious point here arises. We may lay it down as pretty\ncertain that in all cases of hysterical anaesthesia the feeling of the\nanaesthetic limbs is not absolutely lost, but subsists as part of a sub\njacent chain of memory. Professor Janet's book, L'Automatisme\n1'sychologique, contains abundant illustration of this fact, which is\nquite in accordance with what we should expect. But is the pain\nwhich is evaded by the superficial self felt by the subliminal 1\nThe answer to this question is not equally clear. On the one hand,\nin some trifling experimental instances, the pricks, &c, inflicted\non the anaesthetic hand have been observed and complained of by\na subjacent consciousness. Whether they are really felt, however, is\nvery doubtful. For in the more serious cases\u2014amputations, accouche-\nmerits, <fcc., there is often no sign whatever in the countenance of\npain. Occasionally, indeed, there are such signs ; but this seems to\nbe an indication that the trance is not deep. Very rarely indeed\nhas any memory of serious pain been afterwards shown by any\nsubjacent personality. In fact, it seems plain from the behaviour\nof the organism that the disturbance caused by pain has been\nveritably and profoundly absent. Delboeuf's well-known experiment\nwith the two burns goes to prove the same thing. Making two\nsymmetrical burns on the arms of a consenting subject, he suggested\nthat one of them, which he specified, would give no pain. The result\nwas much less inflammation in that than in the equivalent wound, and\na more rapid healing. Similarly when chorea is cured by hypnotic\nsuggestion the morbid movements entirely cease\u2014they do not reappear\nin a trance-condition. On the contrary, they disappear first from the\ntrance-condition, and then from waking life.\nIt seems probable, therefore, that the pain or disturbance is not\nmerely transferred by suggestion to a deeper stratum, but disappears\naltogether. And this view is confirmed by the fact that when morbid\nappetites (for brandy, opium, &c.) are removed by suggestion from the\nsuperficial self, we do not find any trace of their persistence in the\nsubliminal self. The healing suggestion may of course be insufficient,\nand the morbid tastes may reappear ; but they reappear in the super\nficial self, as before.\n\f324 F. W. H. Myers.\nThe problem thus suggested is one of wide-reaching importance.\nTo what extent, we may ask, is the result of hypnotic suggestion\nmerely translative ? and to what extent ablative ? Have we a right to\nsay that when a power or capacity is removed from the supraliminal\nself it is merely transferred to the subliminal, but that when a disease\nor an incapacity is removed from the supraliminal self it is abolished\naltogether?\nIt seems surprising that a problem of such interest should not, so\nfar as I can discover, have been previously discussed, or even clearly\nstated. But in fact the very idea that functions removed by suggestion\nfrom the supraliminal self may in reality be transferred rather than\nabolished (an idea so obvious on the theory of personality here pre\nsented) is a comparatively new one, as is shown by the care with which\nProfessor Janet proves this point in relation to suggested systematic\nanaesthesire, in his often-cited work. The elder mesmerists habitually\nconsider any function or phenomena which the \"passes\" have inhibited\nas being for the time altogether non-existent. From our present point,\nof view the problem widens greatly ; and ultimately involves the\nquestion of the relation of our assumed underlying individuality to the\nvarious personalities through which it finds partial and temporary\nexpression.\nWe will return to this inquiry when we discuss the relation to each\nother of subliminal and supraliminal memories. But in the first place\nwe must continue our brief enumeration of the various forms which\nthe subliminal message may assume.\n3. Alongside of these passive automatisms\u2014or sensory presentations\nfrom a subliminal region\u2014with which we have thus far been dealing,\nthere runs a similar series of active automatisms\u2014or motor impulses.\nsimilarly initiated below the level of ordinary consciousness. These\nhave been the main subject of my previous papers ; and in my last\npaper, Vol. V., pp. 526-535, several of the more important were de\nscribed in a connected way. I need not, therefore, return to them\nhere. The reader will remember that they consist largely of affections\nof the active processes of verbalisation\u2014word-writing and word-utter\nance\u2014and of gestures, such as table-tilting, which are practically\nequivalent to speech. They include other gestures also, which some\ntimes claim, as we shall see, to be imitative of the bearing of deceased\npersons. And these motor automatisms, moreover, even when isolated\nand transitory, may be inhibitory as well as impulsive. They may\nconsist, not in an impulse to action, but in an obscurely-felt restraining\npower.1\nIn hysterical subjects, also, these transferences of control over the\n1 See \" A Record of Telepathic and other Experiences,\" Vol. VI., p. 358.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 323\nmotor system from one stratum of the personality to another form a\nfamiliar and interesting symptom.\n4. Thus far the subliminal messages which I have been describing\nhave in a strict sense deserved that name. They have been intimations\nof one sort or another which the subliminal self has initiated and\nwhich the supraliminal self has received. In most cases these messages\nhave been automatisms, active or passive, which have in no wise\ninterfered with the automatist's habitual stream of consciousness. He\nhas observed them or left them unnoted, as he pleased ; he has in no\nway been identified with them. To this general rule dreams have\nformed a partial exception. The dreamer is for the time being identified\nwith his dream ; only in rare instances can he watch it in progress,\naware that he is dreaming. And, in fact, the dream-messages are\nusually lost to the waking self, since few dreams survive the departure\nof the sleep which begat them. We have thus in sleep a first familiar\nexample of that shifting of the strata of personality which we shall\nmeet with under so many aspects. Sleep may pass into so-called deeper\nstates\u2014hypnotic trance, spontaneous somnambulism, &c. And here\nagain some truth may be discerned in the paradoxical statement some\ntimes put forward from Nancy, viz., that the hypnotic trance is identical\nwith ordinary sleep. Surely not identical ; yet it is true that sleep and\nnot hysteria is our truest spontaneous analogy to hypnotic trance. The\nslightest of all changes of personality\u2014sleep\u2014exists, as it were, to show\nus the possibility of such changes, and not only their possibility but\ntheir advantage. Or, to speak with more accuracy, though with seeming\nparadox, sleep is in fact our earliest or primary form of consciousness,\nand waking life is a secondary form of consciousness developed to meet\nexternal needs.\nFor our present purpose, however, it is enough to point out that at\nthis very early stage of subliminal messages we begin to see the possi\nbility that the subliminal self may displace the supraliminal, and may\nmake its deliverances without caring, so to say, whether the supra\nliminal self attends to them or no. Hysteria and insanity afford our\nnext examples, this time of a morbid displacement of the empirical\nself, which may be more or less complete according to the degree of\nintensity which the idees de'lirantes, the sensory hallucinations, or the\ndiseased motor impulses have obtained.\nAnd following our whole series of messages as above described, we\nfind that the emergence of each class of subliminal message is apt to\ncarry with it at least a tendency to the temporary dominance of that\nsubliminal phase of personality from which the message in question\nsprings. Thus even momentary visual hallucinations are sometimes\naccompanied by trance-like states. The experimentally induced halluci\nnations of crystal-vision occasionally lead to trance. And, passing over\n\f326 F. W. H. Myers.\nother sensory automatisms, we find, when we come to motor automa\ntisms, that the automatist has often a vivid sense of }x>ssession\u2014of\nbeing taken hold of by some alien intelligence, and made to write or to\nutter unpremeditated speech.\nThe transition from the control of the empirical to the control of\nthe subliminal self is a gradual one, and may be effected in many\nways. The change of control may take place in one limb at a time.\nFor instance, a hand may first write automatically, but so that the\nwriting can be checked at will ; and may then go on to write irresistibly,\nand may become, first analgesic, and then anaesthetic, as control over\nit is more and more fully withdrawn from the superficial self. And\nwhen this withdrawal has reached a certain stage it is likely that\ntrance will supervene and that the centre, so to say, of the crystallisa\ntion of personality will shift for the whole organism. It will be\ndesirable to deal with these displacements of psychical strata at greater\nlength hereafter, with especial reference to the relation of the new\nmemories thus created to that empirical memory with which we\nidentify ourselves in ordinary life. For the moment I am merely\npointing out that such displacements form a final and an important\nclass among those many forms of subliminal message which we have\nbeen engaged in reviewing.\nAnd here I must close this brief introduction; proceeding in a second\nchapter to the most important part of my task ; namely, the analysis of\nthe content of those subliminal messages whose mere external forms I\nhave thus far been describing. The description and the logical arrange\nment of the forms of these messages is, I think, an absolute prerequisite\nfor any valid analysis of their confused and complex content. Up to\nthis time I have seen no discussion of that content, whether from the\nspiritualistic or from the materialistic side, which has not seemed to me\nto suffer for lack of sufficient area of comparison. Neither from the\nhysterical ward nor from the Spiritist seance-room alone shall we learn\nenough of these bewildering phenomena to entitle us to form a final\nopinion even on what we may have witnessed with our own eyes.\nThere must be a thicker harvest of facts, a freer communication\nbetween opposing schools, a wider basis for induction, before we can be\nsure of explaining rightly even the apparently simplest of subliminal\nphenomena. It must be enough if some notion has here been given at\nonce of the variety and of the strange interrelations of the phenomena\nwhich are waiting to be explained.\nWe are collecting, so to say, from palimpsest and mummy-case\nfragments of writing in many languages and in many alphabets. Some\nof these alphabets are still in use. Others are found in bilingual\ninscriptions, which give a clue to their significance. Others are as yet\nabsolutely indecipherable. At first sight our ever-growing collection\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 327\nappears a meaningless chaos. But we are sure that there must be an\norder beneath the confusion, since from that order our modern,\nworld has grown. And enough is already interpretable to encourage\nus to further effort ; to show us that we are in the presence of things\nancient and wonderful, and of thoughts other than those we know.\nChapter II.\u2014The Mechanism or Suggestion.\nI endeavoured in the first chapter to indicate a point of view\nfrom which a great number of scattered and apparently disparate\nphenomena might be studied in true and fruitful connection. I\ntried to show that however different the act of dreaming might be,\nfor instance, from the act of automatic writing, or a hallucination from\na trance, yet all these had something of common origin from which\ntheir investigation might begin. For my contention is that such\nphenomena as these are not initiated by that ordinary or empirical\nchain of conscious states which in common parlance we identify with\nourselves, but rather by some faculty or intelligence which lies beneath\nthe level of ordinary consciousness, and forms another stratum\u2014 or\nmore strata than one\u2014of that total individuality of each of us where\nof all that we wittingly are and* do is but a limited and incomplete\nmanifestation. This region of hidden activity I have called the\nsubliminal consciousness\u2014or even, when contrasting it with supra\nliminal operation, the subliminal self. And I have explained that by\nthese names I wish to protest against the undue extension of such\nphrases as \" unconscious cerebration,\" and to insist that we have as.\ngood ground for attributing consciousness to some at least of these\nsubliminal operations in ourselves as we have for attributing con-\nssiousness to the intellectual performances of our neighbours. Only\nthe \" solipsist \"\u2014that inflexible logician who refuses to ascribe\nconsciousness to any man in the world except himself\u2014only he\ncan consistently deny consciousness to operations within himself\nwhich, however removed from his ordinary ken, do yet equal or\ntranscend in complexity the operations with which he identifies his.\nintellectual being.\nIn my first chapter I confined myself to tracing the various channels\nby which the \" messages \" of this subliminal self\u2014the indications, that\nis to say, of processes going on beneath the threshold\u2014are brought\nupwards into the cognisance of the empirical self ; the various artifices\nby which they are translated into its familiar tongue, and inscribed in\nits ostensible history.\nWhen the language\u2014so to call it\u2014of these subliminal messages is\nunderstood, their content remains to study. And in fact the content of\n\f,328 F. W. H. Myers.\nthese messages (as here defined) has throughout been the main topic\nwith which these Proceedings have been concerned. We have discussed\nsupernormal phenomena ; we have dwelt on the knowledge which\nreaches us otherwise than through the recognised organs of sense.\nAnd it is, I hold, in the subliminal region that such phenomena are\ninitiated, and that such knowledge is primarily gained.\nMy present purpose is not, of course, to repeat the evidence\nalready given, but to present it in a somewhat new connection, and to\nsupplement it by new matter at several points. It is possible, I think,\nto frame a rough provisional scheme or synthesis into which the\nvarious phenomena thus far noted may naturally fall, when they are\n,considered simply as messages passing from one stratum to another of\nthe percipient's mind ; passing upwards from a subliminal region of\nwider knowledge and faculty into the supraliminal realm of ordinary\nempirical life. It will be our business to analyse the contents of these\nmessages, and to consider what kind of knowledge, what kind of faculty\nmay be therein implied.\nAnd here I must recur for convenience' sake to a metaphor already\nsuggested. I shall speak of our habitual range of consciousness as of a\nvisible spectrum, bounded at one end by organic functions which we\n,cannot by any effort assume under conscious control, and at the other\nend by the highest efforts of reason to which the mind can attain.\nBelow the physiological limit of the spectrum lie a vast number of\n,complex processes belonging to the body's nutrition and well-being :\nprocesses which our remote ancestors may possibly have been able to\nmodify at will, but which to us seem so entirely withdrawn from our\nsphere of volition that if we wish to alter them we do so from the out\nside, so to say, and by drugs and medicaments ; and in just the same\nway, whether the body to be treated is our own or our neighbour's.\nNear to or above the psychological limit lie those \"inspirations of\ngenius\" which the reason can neither explain nor renew, and all that\nunknown realm of telepathy and clairvoyance which it is our special\ntask to explore. There is, indeed, no ground for supposing that this\nspectrum of our habitual consciousness is in any sense a continuous\none. It probably includes only those rays of knowledge to which\nnatural selection has forced us to become, and to continue, sensitive,\nand it may therefore be studded with dark lines\u2014full of gaps and\ninterruptions where some form of perception which might have con\nceivably existed for us on the same plane as our recognised senses has\n,either never been developed (as a \"magnetic sense\"), or has declined\n(like the sense of smell) from its ancestral potency.\nAnd again, there is not necessarily any deeply-lying distinction\nbetween powers which I have classed as infra-physiological and powers\nwhich I have classed as supra-psychological,\u2014beyond the respective\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 329\nlimits of my imaginary spectrum. For aught we know, these powers\nmay go often together, and an intelligence which is still sensitive to\nperceptions organic and in common life forgotten may be sensitive also\nto perceptions supernormal and in common life unattained.\nAnd, indeed, the interrelation of these unknown powers can only\ngradually and empirically become discernible to our experiment and\nobservation. Our supraliminal consciousness is but a floating island\nupon the \" abysmal deep \" of the total individuality beneath it ; and the\nwaves which wash under one end of our narrow standing-place are\ncontinuous with the waves which wash under the other.\nNevertheless, if used with caution, our distinction between the\ninfra-physiological and the supra-psychological prolongations of the\nspectrum of consciousness may be of service in grouping into two\nor three main masses the sporadic phenomena with which we have\nto deal. Any grouping, indeed, which suggests even partial truths\nwill here be of service ; so incoherent are the separate observations\nwhich are still every month recorded as noteworthy ; so unexplained\nby psychologist or physician are even those observations which have\nbeen so often repeated as no longer to be worth recording.\nIt will be convenient to deal first with the infra-physiological\nphenomena ; and among these it will be convenient to begin with such\nphenomena as the practice of hypnotism is rendering tolerably familiar.\nThe time has certainly not arrived when either psychology or\nphysiology can offer a logical or complete conspectus of these new\nfacts. Every year\u2014almost every month\u2014has its fresh surprises, and\neach group of experiments still depends so inexplicably on the personal\nqualities both of operator and of subject that it would be absurd to argue\nas though we had all the phenomena before us. For my present pur\npose three rough divisionswill suffice. I will take first what may be called\nthe great dissociative triumph of hypnotism, namely, the inhibition\nof pain under conditions of nerve and tissue with which under ordinary\ncircumstances pain seems inevitably connected. Secondly, I shall\ntake what I may call the associative or synthetic triumphs of hypnotism,\nnamely, the production and control of organic processes which no effort\nof the ordinary man's can set going, or in any way influence. And\nthirdly, I will take the intellectual or moral achievements of hypnotism ;\nachievements based, no doubt, upon physiological changes resembling\nthe changes involved in the two previous classes of effect, but which,\nnevertheless, must needs have for us a deeper significance, and suggest\nproblems still more profound. . . ......\n1. The suppression of pain, by whatever means, is in itself so\nwelcome a result that men have not been apt to look closely into\nits psychological concomitants. Yet it is obvious that psychologically\nthe whole interest lies in the question whether pain is suppressed\nz\n\f330 F. W. H. Myers.\nalong with sensation of every kind, or whether other modes of sensation\npersist, and only pain is inhibited. Our ancestors, one may say, had\nalready a rough practical knowledge of this distinction. They knew\nthat if you felled a man with a club, and stunned him, he would not\nfor some time feel the pain of the blow. And they knew also that if\nyou ran pins into particular points on a witch's body, the witch,\nalthough perfectly awake, would feel no smart.\nNow, the second of these practical discoveries, although often\nderided by enlightened persons, and called \" the meanest of paganish\nand popish superstitions,\" was in reality of much greater importance\nthan the first. By stunning your enemy you only proved that vital\nfunctions could continue unimpaired while the brain's action was so\nfar disturbed that all consciousness was for the time abolished. By\npricking the witch in her so-called \" marks \"\u2014-we should now call them\nanalgesic zones or patches\u2014you proved that pain was a dissociable\naccident of organic injury, that other sensations might persist and only\nthe sensation of pain be in some way inhibited.1 The world grew more\nhumane, and the poor women who had been tortured under the\nmeaningless name of witches were pitied or laughed at under the\nalmost equally meaningless name of hysterics. Physicians, indeed,\nwere still loth to draw any lessons from phenomena so morbid and so\n',' fraudulescent.\" But whenever Science resolutely attacks any amalgam,\nhowever cunningly compounded, of charlatanism and fact, the time\nmust soon come when \"the bowling beats the batting,\" when tests are\ndevised and rules of evidence laid down which the half-educated impostor\ncannot meet. So it has been with hysteria, which to the psychologist\nat any rate has now become more instructive than any other group of\nphysical derangements. And the analgesia or insensitiveness to pain\nwhich runs wild in hysteria is now being directed into useful channels\nby that power which we shall have to discuss as \" hypnotic suggestion.\"\nThe inhibition of pain, indeed, is now practised, so to say, no longer as\na laboratory experiment, but on a commercial scale ; and while the\nrearguard of the medical confraternity still deny its possibility, the\npioneers are showing to the world many of the patients, say, of\nthe H6pital Civil at Nancy traversing the phases of their various\norganic maladies with scarcely more than malaise, and laying down\ntheir nervous sufferings in the out-patients' room as easily as their\ncloaks and hats.\nMy object here, however, is not to discuss either the obvious\nadvantages or the possible dangers of this suppression of the ancient\n1 Local analgesia occurs also in some rare cases in diseases affecting certain tracts\n,of the spinal cord. I am assuming in the text, for simplicity's sake, that with some\nwitches, as with some hysterics, these patches were analgesic only, and not\nanaesthetic.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 331'\ncurse. Rather I am concerned to show that some intelligence is\ninvolved in a suppression thus achieved\u2014achieved not as narcotics\nachieve it, by a wholesale deadening of consciousness of all kinds, but\nby the selection and inhibition from among all the percipient's possible\nsensations of precisely those which will be in any way disagreeable to\n' him. It is not the mere anresthetisation of some particular segment of\nthe body or particular group of nerve-endings\u2014such as cocaine, for in\nstance, might produce\u2014but a removal also of a number of concomitant\nfeelings of nausea, exhaustion, anxiety, not always directly dependent on\nthe principal pain, but needing, one would say, to be first subjectively\ndistinguished as disagreeable before they are picked out for inhibition.\nAnd note that this freedom from pain is achieved without either\ndeadening or dislocating the general nervous system ; with no approach\neither to coma or to hysteria. Even the so-called hypnotic trance is no\nlonger a necessity in these experiments. With some subjects, and in long\noperations, it may be needful to induce it; but many minor deliverances\nfrom pain are effected either by simple suggestion in the waking state\nor by post-hypnotic suggestions given in the trance, but destined to\nfulfil themselves after the awakening. And if trance there be, that\ntrance is often no mere lethargy, but a state fully as alert-and vivid as\nwaking life ; as, for instance, in a case recorded by Professor Delbceuf\nand Dr. Fraipont, where a woman laughed and joked during the crisis\nof a severe confinement.1\nIn view of cases like this it is plain that hypnotic analgesia is by no\nmeans a mere ordinary narcotic\u2014a fresh specimen of the methods\nalready familiar for checking pain by checking all conscious cerebration.\nIt is a new departure ; it is the first successful attempt at dissociating\nforms of sensation which throughout the known history of the human\norganism have almost invariably been found to exist together.\nNow if this achievement were due to the ingenuity of some\nphysician, we should surely hail him as the master mind of the age.\nMust we not still admit that there is intelligence, although that\nintelligence works unseen ? Let all due honour, indeed, be given to\nthe hypnotist, who directs that hidden knowledge towards the relief c f\nhuman pain. But he directs the knowledge ; he does not himself create\nor even possess it. Professor Bernheim's command, \" Feel pain no\nmore ! \" is no more a scientific instruction how not to feel pain than the\n1 Revue dc VHypnotisms, April, 1891. This carefully recorded case presents several\nsignificant points ; e.g., the increased power of the entranced patient to accelerate the\nefforts of nature (pp. 291,296) ; the recollection in a subsequent hypnotic state (p.293) ;\nthe influence of suggestion in producing the secretion of milk at a fixed hour (p. 294*.\nIn this same subject a cyst on a tendon at the wrist, which had always reappeared\nafter crushing, was crushed in the hypnotic state with the suggestion that it should\nnot reappear, and appeared no more.\nZ 2\n\f332 F. W. H. Myers.\nprophet's \" Wash in Jordan and be clean ! \" was a pharmacopceal\nprescription for leprosy.\nI have dealt thus far with this new faculty of dissociation in its\nsimplest and most massive form. But the mere production of general\nanalgesia\u2014the mere severance of sensations of pain from sensations of\ncontact, temperature, &c,\u2014is by no means the only dissociation which\nhypnotic suggestion can effect. The \" negative hallucinations \" or\n\" systematised amestheshe,\" which are so familiar in hypnotic experi\nment, are in fact segregations of particular groups of sensory impres\nsions, which are then transferred from the supraliminal to the hypnotic\nself. You may say to a good hypnotic subject : \" After you are\nawakened you will not see Mr. A., nor hear his voice, nor feel\nhis touch \" ; and in fact the subject, awakened and apparently\nnormal, will be irresponsive to those special stimuli\u2014will seem\nand in a sense will be absolutely incapable of seeing, hearing, or\nfeeling Mr. A. But nevertheless\u2014and this result, which experiment\nhas in many cases actually detected, is, from our standpoint, probable\nenough\u2014the sights, sounds, and touches which are unperceived hy\nthe subject's supraliminal are habitually perceived by his subliminal\nconsciousness ; and in fact, he must somehow or other hear and dis\ntinguish Mr. A.'s voice in order to know when not to hear him,\u2014feel and\ndistinguish Mr. A.'s touches in order to know what touches are not to\nbe felt. This observation, which Professor Janet, for example, has\nworked out with great delicacy, strikingly shows the inadequacy of the\nold views which saw nothing in hypnotism except a narrowing of pre\nexisting powers, a focussing of the intelligence on such ideas as the\nhypnotiser might choose to suggest. \"The hypnotiser,\" such men would\nsay, \" fixes the subject's attention on himself; and the subject is con\nsequently incapable of seeing or hearing Mr. A.\" Now this explana\ntion applies well enough to cases of fascination, where the operator\nkeeps the subject's eyes fixed on his own and the subject's whole mind\nintent on watching his movements. But in the more delicate experi\nment above described the case is entirely different. The subject pays\nno special attention to the hypnotiser, and may be superficially occupied\non anything you please. But meantime his subliminal consciousness\nis attending to its special task ; it is singling out and keeping apart the\nsights, sounds, touches which proceed from Mr A.; it is adding to the\nperceptivities of ordinary vigilance this special watchfulness of its own.\n2. This segregation of a group of sensations which I have just\nbeen describing may be classed with equal justice as a dissociative or\nas an associative act. The group of sensations is severed from the\nmain supraliminal current, and thus far the act is dissociative. But\nthe group itself has somehow to be formed ; and when we begin to see\ncomplexity in the group, strangeness in the synergy which it involves,\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 333\nthen we may fitly begin to dwell on the associative side of the achieve\nment. I have already pointed out that the inhibition of all the pain\nconsequent on an operation is in reality a complicated associative pro\ncess, and involves the singling out and fitting together of a great\nnumber of sensations which have only the subjective bond of being*\ndisagreeable to the subject,\u2014with a view of then inhibiting this whole\ncomplex of sensations, and leaving the supraliminal consciousness in\nperfeet ease. The cases on which I am now about to dwell are funda\nmentally akin to that previous type ; but they have this difference,\nthat the groups of sensations which suggestion calls into being are\nformed to be felt, not to be unfelt\u2014are themselves no longer the absent\nor deleted background, but the prominent and conspicuous phenomenon.\nAnd here let us pause for a while:\u2014in accordance with a pian which\nI have already suggested\u2014and consider whether we have any sort of\nguide as to what we may expect in this new direction. This is exactly\nthe moment for such a review. For as we gradually gain power over\nour organisms we may expect to observe various vital phenomena\npassing through three stages. First, they will occur spontaneously.\nNext, they will be empirically produced. And lastly they will be pro\nduced scientifically ; produced, that is to say, with real knowledge of\nthe conditions on which they depend. And with regard to these\nphenomena of nervous association, of organic process, presently to be\ndescribed, we are now just entering the empirical stage ; the stage at\nwhich we can sometimes set the machinery going, but have no notion\nhow it works. It is therefore important to take stock, so to say, of the\nwhole range of spontaneous phenomena corresponding to the phenomena\nwhich we are endeavouring to produce. We shall thus learn- how far\nwe are likely to be able to go, and we may get hints as to the quickest\nline of progress.\nWhat we have to consider, then, are the instances of the so-called\n\" action of the mind on the body \" which have attracted notice before\nhypnotic suggestion was known. Now, of course, there is no real line\nof delimitation between those actions of the mind on the body which\nhave been considered wonderful and those which have been taken as\nmatters of course. That I should be able to hold my pen because I\nwish to hold it is ultimately just as great a mystery as that I should\ndevelop stigmata from meditating on the Crucifixion. But we must let\nthis pass ; and even as we have already taken for granted a habitual\nspectrum of consciousness, so also we must take for granted a habitual\nrange of will, within which our mental impressions are accustomed\nto produce effects\u2014mainly but not solely motor effects\u2014upon our\norganism. The cases now to be cited are those where mental\nimpressions have produced effects, either voluntary, but outside of\nthe usual range of volition, or involuntary (so far at least as the\n\f334 F. W. H. Myers.\nsupraliminal will goes), and extending below the physiological limit of\nthe conscious spectrum,\u2014involving organic processes which we cannot\nwittingly initiate or control.1\nLet us take first those small extensions of ordinary power over the\norganism which some men can achieve by the exercise of waking will.\nNext, let us take the unspecialised effects of emotion upon the organism.\nAnd thirdly, let us take the specialised effects\u2014the cases where\nunintended external suggestion or involuntary self-suggestion has\nproduced results no longer vague and massive, but corresponding with,\nsomething like intelligent or purposive exactness to the nature of the\nshock.\n(1) The extensions of man's waking power\u2014his power in \" cold\nblood \" as we say\u2014over his organism are not as yet very numerous.\nWe have some instances of advanced control over the digestive system,\n\"voluntary rumination,\"and acceleration of peristaltic movements. We\nhave Colonel Townsend, with his historic power of quickening and slow\ning the heart's action. We have alleged instances of voluntary con\ntraction and dilatation of the pupil. And we have a few dubious\ncases like that of the great preacher Irving, who is said to have checked\ncholeraic symptoms by supreme effort of will\u2014to have stayed the\nadvancing army of microbes (si credere dignum est) by the intensity\nof the tonic stimulus given through the brain to his own heart or\nsecretions.\nThe list of man's conquests over his organism, as old text-books\ngive it, hardly goes further than this. I shall have to show further on\nhow far this list is from exhausting the possibilities of the case.\n(2) Let us go on to the unspecialised results of emotion, by which\nI mean the effects which are determined in one direction or another\nrather by the antecedent conditions of the organism than by the\nspecific character of the emotion itself. The emotion, of course, will pro\nduce different classes of effects according as it is of a tonic or of a\ndepressing character ; but the direction which the exaltation or\n(oftener) the depression takes will follow the lines of least resistance or\nof readiest overflow. Tonic mental impressions have improved the\ngeneral health in a great variety of ways, and have caused gout and\nrheumatism to disappear. Depressing shocks have affected almost\n1 Most of the cases here briefly mentioned will be found in Dr. Hack Tuke's useful\nwork on The Influence of the Mind upon the JSodi\/. (London: Churchill; 2nd Edit.,\n1884.) The cases cited in that book are, some of them, admittedly remote and ill-\nrecorded ; but few will dispute the general truth of Dr. Hack Tuke's evidence. I\nmay add that my principle of arrangement is quite different from his, and that he is\nin no way committed to the use here made of his facts. A collection of more recent\ncases will be found in a tract by Dr. Morton Prince on \"Association Neuroses,\"\nreprinted from the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease (Boston, U S.A ) May\n1891.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 335\nevery organ in the body. Nausea, purgation, sweating, shivering, arrest\nof milk, whitening of hair, are familiar results. We also find cases of\ndeafness, blindness, aphasia, spasmodic asthma, and jaundice thus\ninduced. Chorea, epilepsy, rupture of pulmonary vessels, tetanoid\nconvulsions, hemiplegia, idiocy, may also follow, and syncope or apoplexy\nmay kill on the spot. These varied effects show how vast and vague is\nthe power which the highest cortical centres possess over the organism.\n(3) Our third class has to consist of results specialised, not by the\nprevious condition of the .organism, but by the nature of the exciting\ncause itself. These are partly suggestions from without, partly self-\nsuggestions,\u2014not of a purposive, but of a morbid or arbitrary kind.\nThe most important of these, if fully established, would certainly be\nthose definite influences which are perhaps exerted on the embryo\nthrough the mother's organism.1 But there are also sympathetic pains\nor marks which sometimes follow upon the sight of suffering or accident\n\u2014as ecchymosis from seeing a friend bled ; swelling of the lips from\nseeing a child press its knife between its lips ; or a red mark on the\nankle from seeing a gate likely to fall against a child.2\nSuch, too, are the cases of uncontrolled or morbid imitativeness ;\nbeginning with imitative yawning, and including imitative spasms\nand paralyses, on the type of croup, epilepsy, paraplegia, <fcc.\nIn these cases there is a strong suggestion from without, morbidly\naccepted by the organism. In other cases the external stimulus may\nbe very slight, but the patient's self-suggestion gives it some peculiar\npower. Thus Dr. Morton Prince cites a case where a lady believed\u2014\nhad in fact effectively suggested to herself\u2014that the mere presence of. a\n1 Few subjects stand more in need of statistical and experimental investigation\nthan this question as to the degree of definiteness of the influence which the mother's\nsensations and emotions can exercise upon the unborn child. See HackTuke, op. cit.,\nVol. II., pp. 68, 69, and cases in Li^beault, Lc Sommcil ct les etuts analogues, and in\nthe British Medical Journal, 1880, Vol. I. In the Revue de VHypnotisme, August,\n1891, p. 52, Dr. Liebeault describes a case where Madame L. received so great a shock\nfrom suddenly meeting a woman with port-wine mark over half the face that durin g\nthe whole of a pregnancy which was then beginning (although as yet unknown to\nherself) she suffered from a distressing hallucination which represented many of the\nstrangers whom she met as disfigured in this special way. She had, however, no\nbrooding or anxiety about her child. When the child was born the hallucination\ndisappeared, but the child had a port-wine mark over half the face. Dr. Liebeault\ninferred that this woman would prove easily suggestible ; and this was the case. He\nproposes that physicians should suggest to pregnant women marks of a definite but\nharmless kind, with the view of obtaining direct experimental proof of a pre-natal\ninfluence, which, if it exists, might obviously be utilised for the child's good. And\nindeed some striking analogies between these alleged cases cf maternal influence on\nthe unborn child and the now known results of suggestion after birth furnish a strong,\nthough indirect, argument in favour of the view that the embryo may receive\ndefinite and localised, as well as massive and pervading impressions from shocks\nundergone by the mother's organism.\n- Hack Tuke, op. cit., Vol. II., p. 35.\n\f33G F. W. H. Myers.\nrose in, the room brought on violent catarrh and weeping. And in\nfact, whenever she smelt a rose these symptoms did occur. Her\nphysician at last bethought him of a remedy which matched the\ndisease. He suddenly presented to her an artificial rose, which she\ntook to be real. The distressing symptoms followed at once. But\nwhen he showed her its innocence of scent or pollen the mental shock\nrestored, if I may so say, the sanity of her subliminal nasal self. The\nself-suggestion was broken, and she could thenceforth smell roses as\nsafely as her neighbours.\nThe interest in this case lies in the strength, the definiteness, and\nthe isolation of the \" association-neurosis\" or morbid self-suggestion.\nIn hysteria, I need not say, fresh association-neuroses may be formed\nevery day, and the whole range of action seems dominated by that\nrandom self-suggestiveness which I have already described as a disease\nof the hypnotic self.\nOf course, spontaneous self-suggestions may be beneficial as well as\nnoxious. The patient's notion that particular things will do him good\nmay be as efficacious as his notion that particular things will do him\nharm. And before hypnotic suggestion was heard of, the adroit\nphysician had taken advantage of this \"power of the imagination\" to\neffect many a cure. No drug has produced such striking and various\neffects as a bread pill. The empty chloroform bottle has produced an\ninsensibility as deep as chloroform itself can engender.\nBut here we are passing insensibly into the \" suggestive medicine \"\nof the modern hypnotic physician. Nor is this matter for surprise.\nFor if hypnotism be, as I maintain, a name for a group of empirical\npractices by means of which we can manage to get hold of subliminal\nfaculty, we must expect that some of those practices will fit themselves\non to simple rules already known. And in fact these spontaneous\nmanifestations of subliminal associative power operating below the\nphysiological limit of our habitual spectrum of consciousness repeat\nthemselves throughout all their range in our hypnotic experiments,\nwith the difference that they are now no longer random but purposive,\nand can be ingeniously directed into subtler channels than hazard or\ndisease could shape.\nThis is not the place for any complete enumeration of the modes of\nintimate control over the organism with which hypnotic suggestion is\nyearly making us more familiar. I will but cite instances enough to\nshow how varied, complex, and penetrating that authority has already\nshown itself to be.\nProfessor Beaunis and Dr. Krafft-Ebing have slowed the pulse by\nhypnotic suggestion;1 and these savants, as well as Professor Bernheim,\n1 Beaunis, Le Somnumbulisme Provoque ; and see, for list of articles on vesication\nby suggestion, Professor Pitres' L'Hystirie et VHypnolisme, Vol. II., p. 179.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 337\nM.

Mabille, Ramadier, Bourru, Burot, have pro\nduced localised hyperaemia, epistaxis, ecchymosis.1 Dr. Forel and\n,others have restored arrested secretions at a precisely fixed hour.2\nDr. Krafft-Ebing has produced a rise of temperature at moments fixed\nby himself,\u2014a rise, for instance, from 37deg. to 38.5deg. C.3 Burot has\nlowered the temperature of a hand as much as lOdeg. C. by suggestion.4\nHe supposes that the mechanism employed is the constriction of the\nbrachial artery, beneath the biceps. \" How can it be,\" he asks, \" that\nwhen one merely says to the subject, ' your hand will become cold,' the\nvaso-motor nervous system answers by constricting the artery to the\ndegree necessary to achieve the result desired 1 C'est ce qui depasse\nnotre imagination.\"\nTwo or three instances may be given more at length.\nThe following is an abstract of Dr. Levillain's account of an experi\nment performed by Professor Charcot before a large class at the\nSalpetriere.5\nSome few hysterical patients, it appears, suffer from a swelling with\nlocal cyanosis and low surface temperature,. styled by Professor Charcot\n\" blue oedema.\" Professor Charcot, indeed, claims to have been the first to\ndescribe, in June, 1889, this exceedingly rare hysterical abnormality. It\nthen occurred to him to try whether he could produce the condition by\nhypnotic suggestion. \" On April 26th, 1890, a hysterical woman was\ndeeply hypnotised, and it was suggested to her that her right hand and wrist\nwould swell and become cyanosed. After she was woke this suggestion\ngradually realised itself, and in four days the right hand was in the condition\nof that of the patients who had had spontaneous attacks. There was a\nsmooth surface, hardly any pitting on pressure, but much dull-blue mottled\nswelling (which had obliged her to discontinue wearing her rings) and\namesthesia. A bright red patch was produced by touch. . . . M. Charcot\nre-hypnotised the patient, and assured her that her hand was quite natural\nagain, helping his suggestion with a little massage. After a quarter of an\nhour the anaesthesia, venous colour, and swelling were gone.\"\nThe subliminal consciousness, it will be seen, was able to turn out\n1 See, for a brief account, Revue de VHypnotisme, December, 1887, p. 183.\n2 Revue de VHypnotisme, April, 1889, p. 29S.\n3 Revue de VHypnotisme, March, 1890, p. 278.

Myers.\nto order the most complicated novelty in the way of hysterical freaks\nof circulation. Let us turn to an equally marked disturbance of the\ninflammatory type, the production, namely, of suppurating blisters by\nthe word of command. This phenomenon has a peculiar interest, since,\nfrom the accident of a strong emotional association with the idea of\nstigmata on hands and feet, this special organic effect has been antici\npated by the introverted broodings of a line of mystics, from- S. Francis\nof Assisi to Louise Lateau. A strange confirmation of ancient legend !\nA singular testimony to the intensity of the meditations of that great\nsaint who\nNel crudo sasso intra Tevere ed Arno\nDa Cristo prese l'ultimo sigillo,\nChe le sue membra due anni portarno.\nI will give one or two of the most striking and least known\nexamples of this suggested vesication.\nThe following experiment was performed by Dr. J. Rybalkin, in\npresence of his colleagues, at the HOpital Marie, at St. Petersburg.1\nDr. Rybalkin had previously experimented in the same way with his\nsubject.\nThe subject was Macar K., a house-painter, aged 16, hysterical and\nalmost wholly anaesthetic. He was hypnotised at 8.30 a.m., and told : \"When\nyou awake, you will be cold ; you will go and warm yourself at the stove, and\nyou will burn your forearm on the line which I have traced out. This will\nhurt you ; a redness will appear on your arm ; it will swell ; there will be\nblisters.\" On being awakened, the patient obeyed the suggestion. He even\nuttered a cry of pain at the moment when he touched the door of the stove,\n\u2014which had not been lighted.\nSome minutes later, a redness, without swelling, could be seen at the\nplace indicated, and the patient complained of sharp pain on its being;\ntouched. A bandage was put on his arm, and he went to bed, under our\neyes.\nAt the close of our visit, at 11.30, we observed a considerable swelling,\naccompanied with redness and with a papulous erythema at the place of the\nburn. A mere touch anywhere within four centimetres of the burn caused\nsevere pain. The surgeon, Dr. Pratine, placed a bandage on the forearm,\nwhich extended up to the superior third of the arm.\nWhen the dressing was removed at 10 next morning we saw at the place\nof the burn two blisters, one of the size of a nut and the other of a pea,\nand a number of small blisters. Around this tract the skin was red and\nsensitive. Before the experiment this region had been anaesthetic. At\n3 p.m. the blisters met in one large blister, as is seen in the photographic\nplate herewith. In the evening the blister, which was full of a semi-\ntransparent yellowish fluid, burst, and a scab formed on the raw skin. A\nweek later ordinary sensibility returned to the scar, and after a fortnight\nthere was only a red mark in the place of the burn.\n1 Scvuc de VHypnotisnie, June, 1890, p. 3G1.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 339\nStill more striking is a case of cruciform marks,\u2014not hitherto\npublished, though printed in the S. P. R. Journal for May, 1887, pp.\n100-5, with comments by the late Edmund Gurney, which express for\nthe first time, so far as I am aware, the very kernel of the problem\nwhich these strangely intellectual modifications of the organism involve.\n(M.\u2014370 )\nFrom Dr. Biggs, of Lima. We owe the record to the kindness of Mr.\nR. Roxburgh, of 1, Victoria-buildings, Weston-super-Mare, to whose brother\nthe account was addressed.\nOctober 18th, 1885.\nDear Mr. Roxburgh,\u2014In reply to your favour of 1st ult., asking me to\ngive you a statement in regard to the cross which you saw on Maria's arm,\nand which I caused to appear there by acting on her mind while in magnetic\nsleep, it was done in this way :\u2014I put her into a magnetic or mesmeric\nsleep by laying my hand on her head for about a minute. I then said : \"Maria,\ndo you hear me ? \" Answer: \"Yes.\" \" Are you thoroughly magnetised ? \"\nAnswer : \" Yes. \" \" Now listen attentively ; a cross is going to appear on your\nright arm, and remain there until I tell it to go away. Here is where it is to\nappear. \" (I then described a cross with my forefinger on the inner side of her\nright forearm.) \" Have you understood what I have said to you 1 \" Answer :\n\" Yes.\" I then awakened her by two or three up-passes ; for the next two\nor three days she seemed sulky and out of sorts, would now and then rub\nher right arm, over the part where the cross was to appear ; when asked\nwhy she did this, said there was an itching and she could not help scratching\nthe place, although there was nothing to be seen that could cause\" the\nirritation. I then magnetised her as before, and asked : ' ' Do you recollect\nwhat I told you the other day about the cross that is to appear on your arm ? \"\nAnswer : \" Yes.\" \" Will it appear ?\" Answer : \"Yes.\" \"When?\" Answer: \"In\na few days.\" \" Well, it must come out in three days '; do you understand 1 \"\nAnswer : \" Yes. \" By the time appointed a dusky-red cross, four or five inches\nlong and about three inches wide, made its appearance. At first we pretended\nnot to notice this, although we could often see the lower part of it when her\nsleeve was partly rolled up in some of her duties in and about the house ;\nshe was our housemaid. It was only at intervals, when thrown into the\nmagnetic sleep, that we could get a full view of the cross ; never a word had\nbeen said to her about the cross in her waking moments, for some time,\nseveral weeks, until one day I pretended to have caught sight of the strange\nmark on her arm, and said : \" Why, Maria, what is the matter with your\narm 1 have you hurt it ? What mark is this 1 Let me see ; pull up your\nsleeve.\" She did so with a slightly sulky, ashamed air. \" Why, it looks like a\ncross ; where did you get this1\" \"I don*t know, sir ! \" \" How long has this been\non your arm 1 \" \" More than a month, sir. \" \" Have you felt anything ? \" \"No,\nsir ; only at one time I had a great deal of itching and burning, and a few\ndays afterwards this mark came out on my arm.\" After this we frequently\nspoke to Maria about the cross, and when requested to she would roll up her\nsleeve and show it to visitors, although she always seemed reluctant to do\nso. Many months afterwards she left our service, and in about two weeks\n\f340 F. W. H. Myers.\nshe made her appearance at my office in town, asking me to remove the cross\nfrom her arm as it attracted the notice of the family with whom she was\nnow living, and she was much annoyed at the many questions asked her. I\nmagnetised her, and then told her that the cross would disappear in a few\ndays, and she would be no more troubled with it. I saw her a few days\nafterwards at Salto ; the cross had disappeared.\nAnother case, which I recollect having told you of : this was the first of\nthis kind of experiment that I tried ; it was in Santa Barbara, California. I\nwas staying there in 1879 with a friend, Mr. G., a long-resident chemist in\nthat town. His wife had a kind of half servant and half companion, a girl of\nabout 18, who complained to me one day of a pain through her chest. With\nout her knowing what I intended to do, I tried magnetism ; she fell into a\ndeep magnetic sleep in a few minutes. With this subject I tried many inter\nesting experiments which I will pass over. One day I magnetised her as usual\nand told her in a whisper (I had found her to be more susceptible this way\nthan when I spoke aloud in my usual voice) : ' ' You will have a red cross\nappear on the upper part of your chest, only on every Friday. In the course\nof some time, the words Stmcta above the cross, and Omcis underneath it will\nappear also ; at same time a little blood will come from the cross. \" In my vest\npocket I had a cross of rock crystal. I opened the top button of her dress,\nand placed this cross on the upper part of the manubrium, a point she could\nnot see unless by aid of a looking-glass, saying to her : ' ' This is the spot where\nthe cross will appear.\" This was on a Tuesday. I asked Mrs. G to watch the\ngirl and tell me if anything seemed to ail her. Next day Mrs. G. told me\nshe had seen the girl now and again put her left wrist over the top part of\nher chest, over the dress ; this was frequently repeated, as if she felt some\ntickling, or slight irritation about the part, but not otherwise noticed ; she\nseemed to carry her hand up now and then unconsciously. When Friday\ncame, I said, after breakfast, \"Come, let me magnetise you a little ; you\nhave not had a dose for several days.\" She was always willing\nto be magnetised, as she always expressed herself as feeling very\nmuch rested and comfortable afterwards. In a few minutes she was\nin a deep sleep. I unbuttoned the top part of her dress, and there, to my\ncomplete and utter astonishment, was a pink cross, exactly over the place\nwhere I had put the one of crystal. It appeared every Friday, and was in\nvisible on all other days. This was seen by Mr. and Mrs. G., and my old\nfriend and colleague, Dr. B., who had become much interested in my experi\nments in magnetism, and often suggested the class of experiments he wished\nto see tried. About six weeks after the cross first appeared I had occasion to\ntake a trip to the Sandwich Islands. Before going, I magnetised the girl,\ntold her that the cross would keep on showing itself every Friday for about\nfour months. I intended my trip to the Islands to last about three\nmonths. I did this to save the girl from the infliction of this mark so\nstrangely appearing perhaps for a lifetime, in case anything might happen to\nme and prevent me from seeing her again. I also asked Dr. B. and Mr. G. to\nwrite me by every mail to Honolulu, and tell me if the cross kept on appear\ning every Friday, and to be very careful to note any change should any take\nplace, such as the surging of blood or any appearance of the words \" Sancta\nCrucis.\" I was rather curious to know if distance between us, the girl and\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 341\nmyself, over 2,000 miles, made any difference in the apparition of the cross.\nWhile I was at the Sandwich Islands I received two letters from Mr. G. and\none from Dr. B., by three different mails, each telling me that the cross kept\non making its appearance as usual ; blood had been noticed once, and also\npart of the letter S above the cross, nothing more. I returned in a little\nless than three months. The cross still made its appearance every Friday,\nand did so for about a month more, but getting paler and paler until it\nbecame invisible, as nearly as possible four months from the time I left for\nthe Sandwich Islands. The above-mentioned young woman was a native\nCalifornian, of Spanish parentage, about 18 years of age, of tolerably good\nhealth, parents and grandparents alive. She was of fair natural intelligence,\nbut utterly ignorant and uneducated.\nThe third case was thus : A lady asked me to try the power of\nmagnetism in reducing the size of a large goitre which troubled her. Her\nneck was 42 centimetres in circumference. Within a few days it began to\ndecrease : it gradually came down to 37i centimetres, and it gave her no\nfurther annoyance. This lady felt the magnetic power in a very limited and\nsingular way ; her eyelids would close in a few minutes, and she could not\nopen them until demagnetised, but she retained the use of all her faculties\nperfectly, so that while I was magnetising her, and occasionally manipulating\nthe goitre, we usually kept up quite a lively conversation on different\nsubjects, she being a highly educated and clever woman. She speaks several\nlanguages with great fluency. One day I conceived the idea of making a\ncross appear on the goitre, on which I was manipulating. I took the little\ncrystal cross out of my vest pocket, and gently placed it on the goitre for a\nfew seconds, desiring as strongly as I could that a corresponding mark should\nappear there as soon as possible. I am sure she did not perceive my doing\nthis, or she would most certainly have made some inquiries. She was\nconversing all the time on some indifferent subject. I usually went to see her\nevery day at a certain hour ; the magnetising and manipulation usually\noccupied about 20 minutes. Every day I anxiously looked for an appearance\nof the cross for a week or so, and then made up my mind that the experiment\nhad failed, until one day, about six weeks afterwards, she received me in\nrather an excited manner, and taking hold of both my hands, she said, \"Did\nyou ever wish that any mark should appear on any part of my body t and\nwhat was it 1 \" I said, much astonished myself, \"Yes, nearly two months\nago I wished that a cross should appear on the goitre.\" She immediately\nremoved her collar, and said, \" There it is.\" Sure enough there was a pink\ncross. She then told me that the evening before her dressmaker had come\nin to try a new dress on, and exclaimed, \" What a curious mark is on your\nneck ? \" She immediately went to the looking-glass and saw it, and\nafterwards showed it to her husband. This mark only lasted two or three\ndays, gradually fading away.\nIn the case of the Californian girl, it might be asked why I conceived the\nidea of making a cross appear only every Friday. It was because I once saw\nin San Francisco, in 1873, a girl who every Friday became cataleptic, in a\nposition as if she were nailed to the cross. She had marks of the nails on\nhands and feet, blood oozing from them. The medical man in attendance\nsaid there was the wound in her side also bleeding. This girl was a protegee\n\f342 F. W. H. Myers.\nof the Catholic Archbishop Alemario of San Francisco. She was very fervent\nat her prayers, and strict in all her church observances.\nThe San Francisco papers of the beginning of 1873 had a great deal to say\nabout her. These cases have not been infrequent. I then supposed it to be\na case of auto-magnetisation, and my experiments since have proved it to\nhave been so, to my own satisfaction at least. I once sent word to the\nArchbishop that I thought I could explain to him the how and the wherefore\nof these wonderful occurrences ; all could be accounted for through the power\nof animal magnetism. His answer (by a mutual friend) was \"that magnetism\nwas of the devil, and he would have nothing to do with the subject.\" So the\npoor girl was first called a saint full of miracles, and afterwards condemned\nas an impostor and expelled, if not from the Church, at least from the kind\nprotection of the Archbishop. M. H. Biggs, M.D.\nAfter discussing the possible mechanism by which the tingling of a\nfinger, when we think steadily of one finger, may be brought about,\nMr. Gurney goes on to say :\u2014\n\" But difficulties increase as we go on. However the finger was affected\nby the idea of it, the idea of it was at any rate a distinct thing\u2014an image\nwhich could be clearly detached in the mind. This cannot be said of all the\nparts of the body which have been affected by suggestion ; for instance, a\nsmall area on the arm or neck is not, like a finger, clearly detachable in\nthought. I am not aware that redness has ever been produced in such an\narea by internal causes, except under the influence of hypnotic suggestion ; I\nhave myself seen a red patch so produced in a very few minutes on a ' subject '\nof Dr. Liebeault. And another and still longer step has to be made when we\ncome to actual inflammation and vesication, which involve a metabolism of\ntissue over and above mere local erethism, and not to be accounted for merely\nby the dilatation of the small arteries. What can we suppose to be the complete\nphysiological history of such a tissue-change, produced under the influence\nof an idea, and presumably therefore -by efferent nervous impulses ? This\nis a question which probably no physiologist would profess satisfactorily to\nanswer.\n\"The results above recorded (if not produced by rubbing, and apart from\nthe telepathic feature in the last case) seem to involve an equally long step in\nanother direction. If it was hard to conceive the correspondence of a patch\nof minutely localised erethism with the idea of the locality, what are we to\nsay when the patch corresponds with the idea to the extent of being\ncruciform ? It cannot be pronounced impossible that the cerebral area\ninvolved in the idea of a cross should itself be cruciform ; since the same\nelements are no doubt involved as where a cross is visibly presented, and in\nthe case of a visible cross the configuration with which the fibres start from\nthe stimulated part of the retina may be preserved at their central terminus.\nBut no one has ever supposed that a nervous impulse transmitted from\nideational tracts to lower centres, and thence to the periphery, was conveyed\nby fibres which retained precisely similar spatial relations, so that the course\nof the discharge, wherever cut across, would present a similar section. Pass\ning inwards from the periphery along the track of nervous disturbance, should\nwe find cruciformity of area all the way 1 And if not, where docs it stop ?\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 343\nAnd if it stops anywhere, what is the connection between the cruciform\neffect at the periphery, and the cause (even if we assume that to be cruci\nform) in the brain ? In this case, moreover, there would be considerable\ndifficulty in applying the hypothesis of a hallucination of pain which sets up\nthe appropriate physical condition. For it seems doubtful whether a cruci\nform pain can be truly imagined, at any rate as occupying a small area of the\nbody. I do not suggest these difficulties as insuperable objections to the\nhypothesis of a direct effect ; I believe that hypnotic facts carry us considerably\nbeyond any physiological explanations that are yet possible. But phrases\nabout ' the influence of the mind on the body ' are so often loosely adduced\nas though they were themselves the explanation needed, that it is as well to\nkeep the real obscurity of the physiological problems in view.\"\nThere is yet one more case to which I must allude before I pass\non ;\u2014a case in which the intellectual character, as I have termed it, of the\norganic process which responds to suggestion is illustrated in a striking\nand complex way. Mdlle. lima S., a subject observed by Drs.\nJendrassik and von Krafft-Ebing1 (mainly at Gratz), was ultimately\ncured by hypnotic suggestion (or so Dr. Krafft-Ebing claims in 1888)\nof a life-long tendency to hysteria and melancholy, such as had driven\nher grandfather, father, brother, and sister to suicide. She was there\nfore on the whole a great gainer ; but her extreme susceptibility to\nblistering by suggestion amounted to a real risk in the absence of\ncareful guardianship. Once at least she was much injured and offended\nby the culpable act of a medical student who laid a pair of scissors\nupon her chest, telling her that they were red-hot,\u2014and thus created a\nserious wound, which took two months to heal. Krafft-Ebing made a\nhumane variation on this risky experiment. Like Dr. Biggs in our last\ncase, he ordered the production of red patches of definite shapes,\u2014,\nwhich were to be formed without itching, pain, or inflammation. The\nhistory of the process thus set up is a curious one. The organism had\nto perform, so to say, a novel feat ; which took a great deal longer than\nthe rough and ready process of vesication. From February 24th to\nMay 3rd, 1888, a livid red hyper\u00abmic surface corresponding to the\nletter K, was slowly and painlessly developing itself on a selected\nand protected area between the shoulder-blades. It seems doubtful\nwhether this performance was not altogether a new one,\u2014whether any\nprecisely similar trophic changes have ever occurred spontaneously.\nThe support thus given to Dr. Biggs' narrative is most striking ; and\none lesson of the experiments of both physicians undoubtedly is that\nscience need not be the loser by a careful adherence to the rules of\nordinary humanity.\nBut it is the incident next to be cited which speaks the most\n1 \" An Experimental Study in Hypnotism,\" by Dr. R. von Krafft-Ebing, trans\nlated by C. G. Chaddoek, M.D., New York, 1889.\n\f344 F. W. H. Myers.\nstrongly for the educated character\u2014so to say\u2014of the intelligence\npresiding over these organic suggestions.\nMdlle. lima S. was permanently anaesthetic on the right side;\u2014and\nthat side was therefore, in my view, likely to be more immediately subject\nto subliminal control. At any rate it appeared that when any object was\npressed on her left side, and suggested as hot, no mark followed at the\nplace of contact ; but a corresponding brand appeared, symmetrically\nand reversed, upon the right side. For example, an initial letter, K,\nwas pressed by Dr. Jendrassik on her left shoulder. In a few hours\na K-like blister, \"with quite sharp outlines,\" came on the corresponding\nspot on the right side. But note that the new K (the letters are\nfigured in Krafft-Ebing's work) was by no means an exact reproduction\nof the original one. It was of about the same size, but of a different\ntype ;\u2014in fact a capital K in another person's handwriting. Just as in\nDr. Biggs' cases it was the idea of cruciformity which was induced by\nsuggestion, so here it was the idea of K-shape ; and insomuch as this\nsuggested mark corresponded to an intellectual idea, that idea under\nwent some idiosyncratic modification in the subject's subliminal intel\nligence, and the resultant mark, though identical in significance, was\ndifferent in contour.1 And here again we have confirmation of one\nof the most curious of Dr. Biggs' phenomena,\u2014the tardy appearance\nof part of an S\u2014an attempt at SANCTA\u2014as the result of suggestion,\n1 Conscious that the reporter of experiments such as these would even a few years\nago have been derided as the victim of vulgar imposture, Krafft-Ebing fortifies himself\nwith the often-quoted words of Arago : '' He who uses the word impossible outside the\nsphere of pure mathematics, is at least careless. As soon as one is concerned with\nthe living organism, caution becomes a duty.\" Agreed ; but has our eminent specialist\nhimself consistently adhered to this prudent dictum ? \" We did not,\" he says (p. 120),\n\" concern ourselves further \" (after a brief trial of thealleged influence of medicaments\nat a distance) \"with experiments as to a possible transposition of sense,sinee until now\nit has shown itself as error and deception, and is opposed to the elementary laws of\nphysiology. We also put clairvoyance aside, since it contradicts one of the first prin\nciples of empirical psychology, and an increase of the patient's mental functions was in\nno way observed. The single experiment with a suggestion mentale for the divining of\nthe experimenter's thought was a fiasco, i.e., had to be given up ; for the patient\nfatigued herself painfully, and was in danger of having a hystero-epileptic attack. The\nsupposition that in all cases where mental suggestion is said to have succeeded, a self-\ndeception through unintentional suggestions on the part of the experimenter played a\nrote, seems to me authorised.\"\nIs it surprising that rare and delicate phenomena are not discovered when they\nare looked for\u2014or looked away from\u2014in such a fashion as this ? And is it surprising\nthat sweeping '' suppositions,\" supposed to be '' authorised \" on the strength of a single\nexperiment not instantly successful, should fail to impress those whose aim it is to\napply to this special group of experiments precisely the same care and diligence which\nare even now but barely rescuing Dr. Krafft-Ebing's own experiments from the\nundiscriminating scorn which so lately ranked stigmata as even a more staring im\nposture than telepathy? Let each climber take time at least to settle himself com\nfortably on the top of his own tree, before he proclaims to mankind that in all the\nforest there is no tree higher.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 345\nunaided by the physical contact of any S-shaped object, but in its due\nposition above the suggested cross.1\nNo further instances are needed to show the strangeness, the pro\nfundity of the influence over organic processes to which hypnotic\nsuggestion introduces us. It is an influence at first sight bewildering,\nalmost incredible. One might as well believe\u2014one will probably next be\ncalled upon to believe\u2014that warts can be charmed away by saying the\nLord's Prayer backwards. The alleged powers seem equally mysterious\nin their source and in their direction. How can they originally have\ncome into being? And who or what is it that wields them now?\nLet us take these two questions separately ; and let us begin by\nconsidering the possible source or origin of this control over intimate\norganic processes. When we find any faculty existing in man or other\nanimals we are wont to ask ourselves from what ancestors this faculty\nhas been inherited\u2014in response to what external needs it has been\nmaintained and developed ? Can we, then, find anything in our ancestry\nwhich suggests to us these internal powers of modifying circulation,\nquickening cell-proliferation, altering trophic processes in unknown\nways ?\nAny analogies to which we can appeal are certainly vague and\nremote. Yet we can point to the general fact that in man and the\nhigher animals an increase in the power of modifying the action of the\norganism as a whole has apparently been purchased by a decrease in\nthe power of modifying its internal parts or constituent elements. The\nself-shaping powers of the amoeba, the self-regenerating powers of the\nworm or crab, die gradually away into the comparative fixity of the\norganism of the higher mammalia.\nBut it is possible that this fixity is more apparent than real. We\nmay regard, the human organism as an aggregation of primitive uni\ncellular organisms, which have divided their functions, and complicated\ntheir union, in response to the demands of the environment, and along\nsuch lines of evolution as were possible to the original germ. It is\n1 As this paper passes through the press, a remarkable case of stigmatisation is\nreported from America ; as yet only in a newspaper {Courier-Journal, Louisville,\nDecember 7th, 1891), but on the authority of Dr. M. F. Coomes and of several other\nphysicians. According to Dr. Coomes' account, a certain Mrs. Stuckenborg seems to\nhave bled from spontaneously formed stigmata on every Friday since the beginning\nof June. There are wounds on the hands and feet, a wound on the side (from whence\nissues a watery exudation tinged with blood), a cross on the forehead, a large cross\nand a heart on the chest, and the letters I. H.S. on the right shoulder. From three to\nsix every Friday there is profound trance, with superficial ansesthesia, but much\nconvulsive movement and manifestation of inward pain. If we may rely on Dr.\nCoomes' account, which seems a careful one, simulation is quite out of the question.\nThe patient seems to desire neither money nar notoriety. She is a devout Catholic,\nbut does not talk about religion ; and camplains much of the pain and exhaustion duo\nto the wounds and the convulsive trance.\n\f34G F. W. H. Myers.\npossible, too, that all these processes\u2014beginning with the amoeboid\nmovements of the primitive cell\u2014were accompanied by a capacity of\nretaining the impress of previous excitations\u2014a rudimentary memory\nwhich at first constituted all the consciousness which our lowly ances\ntors possessed. And further\u2014may we not suggest 1\u2014as evolution went\non and more complex operations were developed, while the primitive\nprocesses of cell-change became stereotyped by long heredity, the memory\nwhich represented these earlier changes sank to a lower psychical\ndepth ;\u2014became subliminal, and could no longer be summoned by\nvoluntary effort into the supraliminal sequence of conscious states.\nHow do we know that any psychical acquisition is ever wholly lost 7\nor even that a memory is the weaker because it has sunk out of\nvoluntary control ? It may be possible by appropriate artifices to recall\nprimeval memories, and to set in motion any physiological process\nwhich could at any moment of our ancestral history have been pur-\nposively, however blindly, performed. Speculations such as these,\nhowever, can only be justified by the extreme difficulty of the problem\nbefore us; and I am glad to quote a passage which shows that one of\nthe most philosophical of hypnotists has been led to a somewhat similar\nhypothesis. Professor Delboeuf, as will be seen, is in no way committed\nto the conception of a subliminal self ; and his conjecture may prove\nthe more impressive, inasmuch as it is not forced into the service of any\nwider theory.\nPhenomena, says Professor Delboeuf,1 such as those which Louise\nLateau presented, and experiments like those of M. Focachon (the produc\ntion of a blister by mental impression) lead us to suppose that the action of\nthe moral on the physical may be almost if not quite equal to that of the\nphysical on the moral. Thence it follows that the idea of physical mischief\nmay produce mischief ; and on the other hand, that the idea of absence of\nmischief may bring about, or at least favour, a cure. It is this deduction\nwhich was verified by the experiment of the two burns. [It was suggested that\none of two symmetrical burns would not give pain or become inflamed. The\nwound thus specified gave no pain, was not inflamed, and healed before the\nother.]\nHow are we to explain the mechanism of this inverse action of the moral\non the physical ? If we set aside the theory of a mesmeric fluid, we are\nforced to admit that the influence of the will is more extended than we\nused to suppose. It must be able to act not only on the reflexes, but on the\nvaso-motor system, on the unstriped muscles, on the apparatus of secretion,\n&c. If a contrary opinion has till now prevailed, this is because observa\ntion has been exclusively directed to the normal exercise of the will. In\nordinary life, in fact, our attention is mainly concentrated on the external\nworld, the principal source of our pleasures and our pains, and our will is\ndevoted to perfecting our means of attack and defence. The care of the\n1 I quote his latest statement, taken from a tract published in 1890 : Be VEtendue\ndt V Action Curative de VHypnotismc, p. 6.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 347\nvegetative life has been handed over by the will to nervous mechanisms\nwhich have learnt to regulate themselves, and which in general fulfil their\ntask to perfection. Thus the rapid changes of external phenomena mask\nthe regularity of internal phenomena, which accomplish themselves habitually\nwithout our knowledge.\nBut in the hypnotic state the soul is in part drawn aside from the life of\nrelation, while at the same time it preserves its activity and power. It can\nthen, under the impulsion of the hypnotiser, employ those powers to regulate\nmovements which have become irregular, or to repair injuries to the\norganism. In a word, hypnotism does not depress, but exalts the will, by\npermitting it to concentrate itself entirely upon the point where disorder is\nthreatened.\nLet us assume, then, for argument's sake, that the fact that the\ncellular structure of some of our lowly ancestors admitted of centrally-\ninitiated modifications which our own structure under ordinary\ncircumstances no longer allows may have been an indispensable\nprerequisite of this centrally-initiated, definitely-localised, blood-\ndetermination, cell-proliferation, &c, which hypnotic suggestion can\neven now call forth.\n3. But is even this hypothesis wide enough to cover the facts ?\nCan all the effects of hypnotic suggestion be explained by even the\ncompletest revival of ancestral memories ? Or is there not a point\nbeyond which such analogies will not carry us 1 Let us consider for a\nmoment that third class of hypnotic achievements to which allusion\nhas already been made\u2014the moral or psychological changes which,\nsuggestion can effect.\nThese changes must, of course, rest on a physiological basis ; but\nthat basis implies a well-developed, a human brain. The knowledge\nof cortical centres which must somewhere exist to make such changes\npossible can scarcely have been inherited from pre-human ancestors.\nNothing, perhaps, in the whole inquiry is of deeper interest than\nthe possibilities thus dawning upon us of disentangling from the\ncerebral labyrinth which represents a man's tastes and character the\nspecial brain-processes which stand for some special temptation\u2014,\nsay those which represent the reaction of his organism to alcohol.\nWhat is the hidden process that to one patient makes brandy as\nnauseating as it is to a cat\u2014that in another patient makes the morphia-\ncraving as impossible as it is to a rabbit 1 That strongest of all human\npassions\u2014that desire which it is death to yield to, and too often\nsuicide to resist\u2014the injection of morphia itself\u2014becomes absolutely\nindifferent.1\n1 See, for instance, a case of Dr. A. Voisin's, Revue de VHypnotisme, January, 1889,\np. 197, where morphinomania of several years' standing was cured in a month by\nseven suggestions. The patient said that subsequent injections \"ne lui donnaient\npas la sensation agreable de chalenr qu'elle eprouvait auparavant.\"\n2 A 2\n\f348 F. W. H. Myers.\nIn close connection with these reactions to drugs come certain\nother moral effects. With one patient the cure of drunkenness was\naccompanied by the removal of kleptomania.1 In another desperately\nhad case of dipsomania Dr. Voisin combined two forms of suggestion.\nHe rendered alcohol repugnant, and at the same time he brought back\nthe religious convictions and the habit of prayer which had long given\nplace in the poor degraded lady to a bitter and blasphemous unbelief.3\nOther physical temptations, depending on the imagination more\nclosely than does the craving for stimulants, have been controlled by\nsimilar suggestions. The faults of childhood may thus be overcome\u2014\neven faults such as fear, anger, indolence, which one might have\nsupposed to depend upon conditions too diffused and intangible to be\nreadily isolated or removed.3\nI will not here dwell either on the practical importance, or on the\nwider philosophical significance of achievements such as these. My\npresent point is merely this : that when we find that results of a class\nwhich we are accustomed to use all our educative skill, or all our\nself-controlling energy, to secure are effected for us by some agency as\nyet obscure, we are compelled in fairness to class that agency as itself\nintelligent. The power involved may be a power within our own\npossession, but it can at least rank no lower than our conscious mind\nand will.\nAnd here I think that the reader, whatever hesitation he may feel\nas to the explanation for which I am myself arguing, will at any rate\nbegin to inquire with some urgency what is the usual, the orthodox\nexplanation of the mode of production of effects like these ? \" What\nis this power,\" he will say, \" from which no organ and no thought is\nexempt or free ? which can charm away the pangs of childbirth, and\nshed sleep around the surgeon's knife 1 What is this which can\nsummon the secretions, and retard the pulses, and arrest the breath 1\nwhich can check the perilous habit and dispel the dolorous dream ?\nwhich can turn longing into loathing and abhorrence into desire, and\nsway with an impalpable dominance the very tides of the human heart ? \"\nThree main lines of explanation have been offered, singly or in\nconjunction, for hypnotic phenomena. Two of these contain, I believe,\njsome measure of truth ; but they are plainly inadequate. The third is\n1 Dr. B^riHon, in Revue de VHypnotism, September, 1890, p. 75.\n2 Revue de VHypnotisme, September, 1887, p. G9.\n3 See for instance Professor Bernheiin, in Revue de VHypnotisme. December, 1887,\np. 178 ; and Dr.Berillon, Revue de VHypnotisme, January, 1889, p. 197. Dr. de Jong, of\nthe Hague, reports (Revue de VHypnotisme, September, 1891) a cure of theft in a girl of\n11, \"voleuse d'un raffinement incroyable,\" and a thorough reform in a boy of 7,\n\"paresseux, menteur, brutal, idiot moral.\" \"Son caractere fut tellement change'\n,qu'il ne fut presque plus reconnaissable.\" See also Dr. Schrenck-Notzing, Revue de\nVHypnotisme, July, 1890, p. 15.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 349\nwider in scope, but it is in reality no explanation at all ; it is a mere\nrestatement of the problem in a more definite form.\n1. The first explanation was that of Mesmer himself, who ascribed\nthe observed effects to an effluence or fluid which passed from operator\nto subject. The notion of afluid is now out of date ;\u2014although there\nis, as seems to me, important evidence which makes for the existence of\nan influence not discernible by the ordinary senses. It would,\nhowever, be beside the purpose to dwell on this evidence here. For\ninasmuch as experiment has plainly shown that all kinds of hypnotic\nresults can be obtained under circumstances where the supposed specific\ninfluence has no chance to operate, it is plain that we must look further\nfor a solution of our hardest problems.\n2. Many attempts have been made to express hypnotic phenomena\nin terms of cerebral action as at present known to us.1 Thus, for\ninstance, Heidenhain, whose view was in fashion when Mr. Gurney\nand I began, in 1883, to write on hypnotism in these Proceedings,\nattributed the hypnotic state to \" an inhibition of the action of the\nganglion cells of the cerebral cortex, induced by continued weak stimu\nlation pf other nerves.\" To this we replied that \" the theory of the\nshort-circuiting of the nervous current\u2014of the response of action to\nsuggestion without any knowledge of the matter being passed through\nconsciousness at all\u2014is only plausible in cases where the subject\nmimics or obeys his hypnotiser in a quite mechanical way.\"2 The great\ndevelopment, since that date, of hypnotic phenomena which manifestly\nneed some thought, some initiative on the subject's part, has made\nHeidenhain's explanation still more obviously imperfect. Nor is it\nneedful to go here into other speculations as to the modifications of\ncortical nutrition, &c, which may accompany the hypnotic trance. It\nis something more and other than the mere production of trance that\nwe have to deal with\u2014something more and other than the mere\nphenomena of fascination, mimicry, rigidity, which are to be seen\non every itinerant mesmeriser's platform. Discussions on cerebral\ncirculation, on inhibition and dynamogenesis, are useful and needful on\nthe outskirts of the problem ; they may give precision to our conception of\nthe condition in which the deeper phenomena begin ; but they cannot\nexplain the novel powers to which those phenomena introduce us,\u2014the\nincreased, the penetrating control of the brain over the organism.3\n1 For a resume in English of some of these theories, see Dr. Moll's Hypnotism,\np. 203, sqq., or Dr. Lloyd Tuckey's Psycho-Therapeutics, 3rd edit., chaps, iv. and ix.\n- Nineteenth Century, October, 18S3, p. 701.\n3 It is probable, in my view, that inhibitory phenomena, as the most amenable to\npurely physiological artifice, will usually be the first to appear in any hypnotic series.\nThis, I think, is actually the case ; and I suspect that some simple consideration of\nthis kind may have much to do with whatever truth underlies the Salpetriere scheme\nof hypnotic stages evolved successively in a fixed order.\n\f350 F. W. H. Myers.\n3. And indeed among those who are most actively engaged in\nexploring the range of hypnotic effects, little is heard of these various\ntheories as to the physiological processes involved in the induction of\ntrance. Trance itself becomes less and less a central phenomenon ; the\nmethods or artifices used to achieve desired results become more and\nmore simple, rapid, perfunctory. Some term is needed of almost\nindefinite extensibility, to signify a power which seems so indifferent\n,as to its medium of application. \"Suggestion\" is the chosen word;\nthe operator suggests the results to the subject, and the results appear\nbecause the subject is suggestible. And this is a useful verb, a con\nvenient adjective. But what do they explain 1 If I call any given\noccurrence a \" result of suggestion,\" what am I really saying except\nthat the thing happened because somebody said that it was going to\nhappen 1 Our old friend, the \" dormitive efficacy \" of opium, at least\nconfined itself to one special achievement. The \" suggestive efficacy \"\nof the hypnotiser's command is a far grander formula ; for it gives us\nno hint of what it means to do, any more than of how it means\nto do it.\nSurely, then, as I have already said, this doctrine of suggestion can\nonly be regarded as a completer mode of stating the fundamental\nproblem ; as a protest against narrower theories founded on inadequate\nexperience ; whether such theories would, with the old mesmerists,\nascribe all the results to the direct inflow of the \" magnetic fluid \"\nupon the receptive organism ; or, with Charcot, would regard hypnotism\nas a nervous malady, akin to hysteria, and running through definite\nstages of its own ; or, with Heidenhain, Preyer, Lehmann, &c, would\ninsist on the supposed cerebral mechanism of the commoner\nphenomena, without taking into view the mysterious initiative, the\ncomplex domination over the organism which hypnotic, somnambulic,\neven hysterical states unite in manifesting. As against all these the\nprotest of Nancy is needed and effectual ; but it is a protest and\nnothing more.\nIt is, therefore, as it seems to me, in a field almost clear of hypo\ntheses that I suggest my own ;\u2014my view that a stream of consciousness\nflows on within us, at a level beneath the threshold of ordinary waking\nlife, and that this consciousness embraces unknown powers of which\nthese hypnotic phenomena give us the first sample, the scattered\nindications ;\u2014powers sometimes exercised (as we shall presently see)\n\" spontaneously,\" or at the bidding of some higher will ; but sometimes\nalso obedient to a summons sent downwards from the supraliminal\nself.\nHow we are to explain this obedience we shall consider presently.\nBut first it will occur to everyone that there is one way in which such\na conception as this can be tested at once. If the most advanced\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 351\neffects of suggestion are really due to an agency within the subject,\nthe subject ought to be able, if anyone is able, to start that agency\nhimself. The words of others cannot be of fundamental importance.\nSelf-suggestion, in short, must be the central type, and suggestion from\nwithout must be no more than an aid to the subject's own belief.\nIt appears to me that actual observation does largely bear out this\nview. Whichever theory of therapeutic hypnotism has been prevalent,\nI believe that the main difficulty has often lain in overcoming\nthe patient's self-suggestion that he was not going to be cured.1 I\nobserve in the Zoist that the patient who begins by deriding the\n\" passes,\" and who needs hours of Dr. Elliotson's patient work to\ninfluence him, will sometimes end by being able to throw himself into\n\" the sleep\" without the doctor to help him. I observe that in the Sal-\npetriere, the special manipulations which were at first deemed needful\nto transfer the subject from catalepsy to lethargy, from lethargy to\nsomnambulism, are often pretermitted, and the malade passes through\nthe three \" classical stages \" at her own sole impulse. And I observe\nthat with the Nancy school the external suggestion often passes in\nsensibly into self-suggestion, the hypnotiser's influence being less and\nless obtruded, till Dr. Burot (for instance), teaches self-suggestion to\na patient, who sends herself into the trance, determining beforehand\nthe time for which it is to last, and the effect which it is to produce.2\nAnother patient is instructed to throw himself into a trance in order\nto remember and divulge a criminal suggestion made to him in a\nprevious trance.3 Other physicians begin to note with care the effects\nof involuntary* or voluntary5 self-suggestion in their own persons.\nOne physician, indeed\u2014whose book, disfigured by a barbarous title,\nand published in what was at that date a provincial town,6 has been\nless known than it deserves\u2014insisted more than twenty years ago upon\nthe needlessness of any external influence to bring most of his subjects\ninto a state of \" artificial somnambulism.\" \"I have found,\" says Dr.\n\u2022This self-suggestion, often latent, sometimes amounts to an overt fixed idea.\nSee a case in Revue de VHypnotismc, July, 1890, p. 10, where Professor Bernheim's cure\nof a most painfill and dangerous malady was delayed for nearly three years by the\npatient's obstinate refusal to submit to hypnotisation\u2014a reluctance which the physi\ncian at last overcame.\n2 Revue de VHypnotisme, June, 1887.\n3 Revue de VHypnotisme, November, 1S87.\n4 Professor Forel, Revue de VHypnotisme, March, 1889.\n5 Dr. Coste de Lagrave, Revue de VHypnotisme, December, 1889. See also a case\n(Revue de l'Hypnotisme, May, 1889, p. 339), where a sufferer from toothache, angry at\nthe dentist's refusal to hypnotise her for a trifling operation, \"sends herself off\"\ntriumphantly in the dentist's chair and eludes his twinges in spite of him. Si natura\nnegat, fucit indignatio somnum.\n6Statuvolism, or Artificial Somnambulism. By W. B. Fahnestock, M.D., Chicago,\n1869 and 1871. See pp. 71, 203, &c\n\f352 F. W. H. Myers.\nFahnestock, \" that persons always enter this state better without any\ncontact, looking, passes, or anything of the kind, particularly when they\nare assured that they have some competent person to take care of, and\nto converse with them while in it ; and, by observing carefully the\ninstructions which I have given, it is possible for any person to throw\nthemselves into this state at pleasure, independent of anyone.\" Dr.\nFahnestock was one of the earliest authors to declare the efficacy of\npost-hypnotic suggestions, and he insisted that these suggestions\nhad precisely the same efficacy when made by the self-entranced\nsubject to himself. \" This lady could create or relieve pain in any\npart of her body, or even forget her own name when she awoke, if she\nmade the resolution to do so while in this state.\"\nDr. Fahnestock's book and Mr. Hugh Wingfield's paper on \"The Con\nnection of Hypnotism with the Subjective Phenomena of Spiritualism,\"\n(S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. V., p. 279,) are written from very different\nstandpoints ; but those who will compare the two and note the remark\nable concordance between the earlier observer in his remote private\npractice, and the later one experimenting upon healthy Cambridge\nundergraduates, will probably incline to think that the future in\nhypnotism lies with those who can best develop their patients' self-\nsuggestive power.1\nAssuredly I do not suppose that any rationale of hypnotism which\ncan as yet be given .can long hold its ground without modification. We\nwatch a developing group of empirical processes, which may yet touch\nthe confines of science at many an unexpected point. But to me the\nview here suggested has at least the practical merit of enabling us to\nsee hypnotic phenomena no longer as something isolated or exceptional,\nbut as falling naturally under wider laws whose bearings we are else\nwhere beginning to discern. As indicating communication between our\nsupraliminal consciousness and a subliminal consciousness dowered with\npowers as yet unknown, these phenomena form, as I believe, a depart\nment of that far wider realm of communications between state and\nstate, consciousness and consciousness, personality and personality,\nwithin the same individual, which forms the subject of these present\npapers,\u2014the main theme to which these discussions of hypnotism are\nno more than incidental.\nYet before this discussion closes there is one point more which can\nnot be avoided if I would escape the charge of manifest inconsistency.\nI have tried to suggest the source of these subliminal powers ; but\n'The so-called \"Faith-Cure\" is virtually an attempt to persuade patients that\nthey possess the power of self-suggestion. Much success is claimed for it in America ;\nclasses are held, and fees are paid ; but all the accounts of supposed cures which I\nhave seen have been so loose and vague that I can form no estimate of what has\nreally been done.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 353\nwhat explanation can I give of this subliminal obedience ? \" Your\ntheory,\" the critic may say, \" is an attempt to prove the Dtemon of\nSocrates identical with Mr. Merriman. You assume a mystic guide\nwith pre-terrene experience, ultra-mundane sagacity, and you set him\nto drink paraffin oil by the tumblerful without being sick. It may be\ngrand to know how to make blisters, but the subliminal self should be\nmade of sterner stuff than to try that trick on himself whenever he is\ntold. 'Est dens in nobis; agitante calescirnus illo' ;\u2014but it seems hard to\nhold the indwelling divinity so strictly to his word, and not to let him\ngo till he has raised your temperature at least two degrees Centigrade.\nIt is well to be able to take hints, but it is not well to take all hints ;\nand when I tell a man on a platform that there is a fly on the end of\nhis nose, is not that just the occasion when, in Clifford's phrase, the\ninward Monitor ought to whisper, Bosh 1 \"\nBefore I attempt to explain these seeming incongruities I must\nremind the reader that the puzzle is in reality none of my making.\nNo one has any explanation to give of the obedient fulfilment of\npost-hypnotic suggestions. When a man is told, say, to do several\nabsurd things ten days hence, and does them punctually when the\ntime comes round, we may, indeed, attempt to guess how it is that his\nhypnotic self remembers the commands, but we have no notion why it\nobeys them. To call such actions merely reflex would be a misuse of\nterms ; to say that the man is suggestible is only to restate the fact.\nThe mystery of this unquestioning, dog-like obedience cannot be\nfully cleared up until we know much more than we at present know\nof our own intimate structure. Yet it seems to me that a ray of light\nis shed upon it by the theories which I am now advancing.\nIf man's individuality be such as I conceive;\u2014if there be various\nstrata of consciousness, possessed of differing powers, and communicating\nwith each other in obscure and imperfect ways, we are likely to come\nupon many acts which are not distinctly referable to any one given\nstage or stratum of the total individuality. Take the two adjacent\nstrata of sleep and ordinary waking life. There are faculties common\nto both states ; and each state has its faculties which the other does\nnot share. It is as impossible for the waking man to excrete the pro\nducts of brain-waste as it is for the sleeping man to lead a charge of\nhorse. But under certain conditions\u2014and I am not now assuming any\nstate profounder than common sleep\u2014the sleeper will begin to exercise\nin a random way some of the powers which belong properly to waking\nlife. He will strike out with his limbs, or spring to the floor, under\nthe impulsion of a disturbing dream. Meantime the waking self,\u2014the\nproper ruler of the faculties of progression and balance,\u2014stands aside,\nand for the moment these faculties obey the random commands of the\nsleeping usurper. But if these faculties are too rashly drawn upon the\n\f354 F. W. H. Myers.\nsleeper will awake; and the waking self will resume its sway before\nserious harm is done.\nNow I would suggest that somewhat similarly, in these cases of\nblind obedience to hypnotic suggestion, we see a certain knowledge, con\nsciousness, memory, which are properly subject to the will which com\nmands one stratum of the personality, falling temporarily into a\ndreamlike compliance with impulses which reach them from a stratum\nnot their own. For the moment the subliminal will stands aside ;\nbut just as the waking will resumes its sway when the dreamer\nbecomes too violent, so also does the subliminal will intervene if\nthe obedience to hypnotic suggestion is in danger of being pushed\ntoo far. And this will explain a peculiarity in the effect of sugges\ntion which was at first thought to indicate that the obedience was\nmerely simulated, and which since the idea of simulation has been\ndropped has remained a puzzle to many observers. I mean the fact\nthat it is often easier to induce a subject to commit some great\nimaginary crime,\u2014say to put arsenic in his aunt's tea,\u2014than to\nperform some trifling act of manifest inconvenance,\u2014such as taking off\nhis boots in public. It is urged that somewhere within him there\nmust be a shrewd suspicion that the supposed arsenic really came out\nof the sugar-basin. And yet this saving knowledge can hardly be\nlocated in his waking stratum, which retains absolutely no memory\nof the incident. I should suggest that a complete comprehension of\nthe suggested act exists in his subliminal strata, and that when grave\nneed arises the subliminal self will generally avoid compliance ;\u2014not by\nawakening the organism into ordinary life, but by plunging it into a\nhysterical access, or into a trance so deep that the unwelcome order\nloses its agitating power. Thus much as to the interrelation of supra\nliminal and subliminal impulses I think that we begin to discern. But\nnone the less the problem of suggestion must still reach down into\ninsolubility ; for it does but present, in a form complex indeed, but\ndefinite and as it were experimental, that ancient question as to the\ninfluence\u2014resistible or irresistible\u2014of man's physical organism upon\nhis moral choice,\u2014the issues of that world-old conflict in which \" the\nflesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.\"\nWe shall find, indeed, as we go on, that there are certain cases\nwhere a subliminal will, invoked or evoked by hypnotic artifice, has\nproved itself no mere \" slave of the lamp,\" but has insisted on employ\ning its own faculties in its own way. But these instances must be\ndealt with in their place,\u2014among those \" messages,\" or examples\nof subliminal communication, whose place is above what I have termed\nthe psychological limit of the spectrum of ordinary consciousness. To\nthese we must now proceed; and we shall henceforth find ourselves\ndealing for the most part with phenomena of spontaneous, not of\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 355\nexperimental origin. Yet the fact that these higher phenomena also,\u2014,\nthese phenomena of telepathy, clairvoyance, perhaps premonition,\u2014do\nsometimes show themselves under hypnotic conditions, is one of the\nmost encouraging which we have to remember. For nothing is more\nimportant to us than the power of extending the bounds of experiment,\n\u2014of ourselves ascending, with steps however slow and toilsome, the\nMount at whose foot we have waited so long in helplessness till the\nvoice or thunder came.\nThere will be no cause, indeed, for surprise if, as time goes on,\nman's experiments on the world without him should yield in interest\nand importance to his experiments upon himself. \" Inward the course\nof empire takes its way\";\u2014and all man's progress has been a slow\nunfolding of the capacities of the primal germ. Every sense that he\nhas developed, every faculty that he has won, has been but an entry\nupon the fruition of what was stored already in that treasure-house of\nprehistoric gold. All that he has learnt without himself has but been\na means to the comprehension of that which was within. And these\nhypnotic experiments, for all their strangeness and grotesqueness, are\nfollowing in the same sure track ; their lesson also is of a concealed\ndominion ; they too teach that by \" self-reverence, self-knowledge,\nself-control,\" man may become the ruler of his own spirit, and the\nfashioner of his own fate.\n\f35G Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nII.\nSUPPLEMENT TO THE PAPER ON THE EVIDENCE\nFOR CLAIRVOYANCE.\nBy Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. (See j>- 30.)\nPart I.\nI append here three cases which, had they been received in time,\nwould have been included in the paper on the evidence for clairvoyance\nprinted in an earlier part of this volume.\nThe first two belong to the class in which a crisis in the \" agent's \"\nlife appears to be the primary cause of the supernormal perception\u2014\nthe \" percipient \" neither seeking nor expecting any communication ;\nbut where, nevertheless, the actual situation of the agent is presented\nto the percipient as though he were present with him. One of these is\na case of an apparition or vision of a friend at the time of his death,\nand will remind the reader of Mrs. Paquet's experience, p. 32 ; the\nsecond is a vision or dream of a brother at a moment of great danger\nand excitement, and somewhat resembles Mr. Lee's vision of his\nfather, p. 38.\nThe third case is one where the activity is apparently entirely on\nthe percipient's part, the persons seen going through no special crisis\nor excitement whatever. It recalls the experiences with \"Jane,\"\npp. 53-62.\n(L. 890.) The writer of the following narrative, whom I will call\nMr. D., is a lawyer, and is well known to a friend of mine on whose\njudgment that he is a specially good witness I thoroughly rely. He\ndoes not wish names to be published, as it might be disliked by relatives\nof the deceased gentleman.\nJuly <tth, 1891.\nThe incident which I am about to describe occurred on the morning of\nthe 8th July, 1858. At that time and for some years previously I had been\nin partnership and on very intimate terms with Mr. X. Y. As it may be\nsomewhat pertinent to the tale I may observe that some six or seven months\nbefore that date I had been told by the physician attending Mr. X. Y. that\nhe was suffering from angina pectoris and that in all probability his death\nwould be very sudden. The medical man, who was our mutual friend, told me\nat the same time not to allude to his danger in any conversation I might have\nwith him. From that period up to the 8th July, X. Y. was apparently in\nhis usual good health.\nOn the evening of the 7th I sat with him in his own room for a consider\nable period talking upon various matters of business which had no reference\nto him individually. He was well and cheerful. I should now describe\n\fSupplement on the Evidence for Clafa\"voyance. 357\nmy bedroom. It had one window, close to the head of the bed and on\nthe side on which I slept. There was a venetian blind not quite drawn\nclose. On that night, or rather on the morning of the 8th, I awoke\nwith a sensation of fear or distress. Day had dawned and the light fell\nthrough the bars of the venetian blind upon the floor, and there I saw in\nthe light, which was quite sufficient, the vision of X. Y. He lay upon the\nfloor in his nightdress, his knees drawn up, his hands thrown back above\nhis head with the backs of his hands upon the ground. He was perfectly\nwhite and the jaw fallen. It was X. Y. dead. I groaned somewhat loudly\nand awoke my wife, who seized me by the arm and shook me, asking me\nwhat was the matter. I was leaning upon my elbow looking down upon\nthe vision. I replied, \" I see X. Y. dead upon the floor,\" and as I spoke the\nvision faded away. My wife said, \" Oh, you are dreaming.\" I remember\nthat I had asked myself the question, \"Am I dreaming V before my wife\n\u00abhook me and while the vision was distinct. The feet of the vision were\ntowards the window and the face looking almost directly at me and towards\nthe light.\nAfter some time I went to sleep. When I awoke, strangely enough, I\nhad forgotten the incident, nor did my wife allude to it.\nI went to the offices, and was called away upon some pressing business as\nsoon as I got there. The offices were attached to the house of X. Y. I\nreturned about 11 o'clock, being absent about an hour. The clerk informed\nme that Mr. X. Y.'s housekeeper was alarmed, as she could not, after\nknocking at his door, get an answer. In an instant the vision of the early\nmorning came back upon me and I told the clerk at once to get a ladder\nand ascend to his window, which was not very high. The clerk did so and\nascended, was apparently greatly shocked, and descended, almost falling from\nthe ladder. He told me that he saw X. Y. on the floor.\nHe got a large hammer used for breaking coals and forced the door.\nI entered the room with him. On the floor lay the body of X. Y. exactly in\nthe attitude, position, and dress of the vision that I had seen. It was the\nexact counterpart of the vision. He had apparently got up and partly drawn\nup his blind when, being seized with a fit of angina, he had managed to\npour out a half glass of ammonia which stood upon his dressing table,\nbut had fallen back dead in the effort. His housekeeper informed me that\nit was his custom to get up about daybreak and draw up his blind.\nIs it possible that any intense and agonising thought of a man in his\nlast moments could be said to have produced any such effect as that I have\ndescribed ? His heir-at-law was a man whom he regarded with the utmost\nhostility. On the other hand, he had a nephew to whom he was greatly\nattached. He was a man of considerable property and would have left all\nto this favoured nephew. On the day of his death, in searching amongst his\npapers, a will so disposing of his property was found unexecuted.\nImmediately after the discovery of the body I went home and as soon as\nI saw my wife I said, \" X. Y. is dead.\" She replied, \" Oh, the dream of last\n.night ; how very singular.\" '\nI have thought the matter over for many years and have discussed the\nmatter with very many people, but can never arrive at any reasonable\n.solution of the matter. From the moment of the incident until now I have\n\f358 Mrs. H. Sidgwiclc.\nalways been certain that it was not a dream. I mean I was not unconscious\nfrom the moment I opened my eyes and saw the vision. The distress at the\nmoment of awakening was indescribable. It was somewhat the feeling of\none awakened from deep sleep by a sudden shock and to a terrible sight. It\nis 33 years ago, but everything is as clear in my memory as if the matter\nhad occurred yesterday.\nMrs. D. writes the following account of the incident :\u2014\nJuly 2Uh, 1891.\nI have a perfect recollection of the vision or dream of which Mr. D. has\nwritten to you, and on his waking me, and relating it, with a good deal of\ndistress, I said, \"Oh! you are dreaming. \" His reply was, \"No, I am not\nasleep ; look on the floor ; I see X. Y. lying there quite distinctly, just by\nthe streak of light.\" Of course I did not see it, and we did not mention it\nto each other again, until his return home, when he told me what had\nhappened, and I then exclaimed, \"Oh ! your dream.\"\nMr. D. writes, enclosing this letter and saying :\u2014\nHerewith you have a letter from my wife recording her remembrance of\nthe event. Her account (which I have just read) varies slightly from mine,\nbut after the lapse of 33 years this can scarcely be wondered at. I think I\nmust have used the words as given by her, because they seem to have been\nso clearly stamped upon her memory. My impression is that the vision\nfaded as I spoke, but of course I might have finished speaking before it\nbecame quite invisible.\nWe asked Mr. D. whether the evidence of anyone who had seen,\nthe body as it was found could be obtained, but he replies :\u2014\nIt is so long ago that nearly all those who at the time were acquainted\nwith the fact are dead. The clerk who ascended the ladder, and who after\nwards entered the bedroom with me, has been dead more than 20 years.\nThe housekeeper has long since died. Dr. , to whom I have often\ntalked, died 5 years ago. I have had an idea that there might be some\nliving who remembered the incident of the ladder and other circumstances\n. but up to this time I have not discovered anyone.\nAn examination of the Register at Somerset House shows that Mr.\nX. Y. died on July 5th, 1858, not on July 8th. The death was regis\ntered on the 8th. There is therefore a slight error in Mr. D.'s account,\nbut not one of any consequence, since his recollection of the date of\nthe vision is obviously not independent of his recollection of the date\nof the death. An old cash book and other documents in Mr. D.'s\npossession, which he has since examined, confirm the fact that the\ndeath was on the 5th.\nJuly 5th, 1858, was a Monday, and Mr. D. writes as to this:\u2014\nIt certainly has escaped my memory that the day of my last conversation\nwith him was Sunday. I often called upon him on Sunday. I sat with hint\nprobably an hour. It was late in the afternoon, and I recall the scene now\nvery distinctly, and I am sure we talked of nothing that was personal to.\nhimself, for the next day, after the discovery of the body, I remember to\n\fSupplement on the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 359\nhave recalled our interview with the intention of finding a reason for so\nsingular an incident as the vision. I think I may say with equal certainty\nthat between the time when Dr. warned me about his malady and the\nday of his death\u2014a period of many months\u2014I never had any conversation\nas to that malady, or as to death, or in fact anything but the matters of\nbusiness of the firm and the ordinary topics of conversation.\nIt will be noticed in this case that the way in which the vision\npresented itself was somewhat peculiar. There was a sort of economy\nof hallucination\u2014the real window and floor in the percipient's room\nbeing made to do duty for the window and floor of the agent's room,\nand the agent's figure arranged in a corresponding position with regard\nto them. Nevertheless, we are justified, I think, in including the case\nas one of telepathic clairvoyance, because the unusual and unlikely\nposition and attitude of the dead or dying man was correctly perceived.\nCases like this show that clairvoyant percipience cannot be explained\nby the simple supposition of a change in the position from which the\npercipient mind apprehends the external world.\nIn the next case there is a more complete apparent transportation\nof the percipient to the scene described, due probably to the fact that\nhe was less fully awake, and thus less vividly conscious of his own\nactual surroundings.\n(L. 891.) The case comes to us through the American Branch\nof the Society. The event occurred in 1873, and we have accounts\nwritten within a few months of the time and others written recently. At\nthe risk of being tedious I have thought it best to give both. They throw\nsome light on each other, and the general accordance between them tells\nvery favourably for the accuracy of the narrators, though it will be\nobserved that one of the recent narrators introduces a degree of exact\nness of time coincidence which was never proved. This is a point in\nwhich the tendency of memory to simplification renders it, as Mr.\nGurney has pointed out, peculiarly liable to error.\nA letter to a newspaper from which the following are extracts led\nto a correspondence between Mr. Harlow S. Gale\u2014a student of philo\nsophy and member of the Society\u2014and the agent and percipient in the\ncase.\nI was living in Wallingford at that time, raising small fruit. My\nprincipal helper was a young man named Frederic Marks, a graduate of\nYale Scientific School. Frederic had a brother named Charles, who was\nliving then in central New York, near Oneida Lake. One rainy afternoon\nFrederic went upstairs to his room and lay down on a lounge. An hour or\nso after he came back and said he had just seen his brother Charles in\nvision, he thought, as he was not conscious of having been asleep. Charles\nwas in a small sail-boat, and a companion with him, who sat in the stern\nsteering. There seemed to be a wild storm prevailing, for the sea ran high.\nCharles stood in the bow grasping the mast with one arm, with the other he\n\f360 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nhad hold of the boom, which appeared to have broken loose. His danger\nous position so frightened Frederic that he awoke, or the vision departed.\nMost of the family were of opinion that he had unconsciously fallen asleep\nand this was only a dream.\nThree or four days after this, however, Frederic received a letter from\nCharles, giving an account of a peculiar adventure he had just met with on\nOneida Lake. On the morning of the day in question he and a companion\nwent to the lake, hired a boat, and went out for a sail. As the day was fine\nthey went down the lake as far as Frenchman Island, some 20 miles distant.\nIn the afternoon, as they were returning, a furious storm came up.\nCharles was kept busy baling out the water while his companion steered.\nAt the height of the storm the boom gave way. Charles, seeing their\ndanger, sprang into the bow of the boat, and grasping the mast with one arm\nand the boom with the other, managed to make it fast again. They\nsucceeded in keeping the craft afloat until she struck on the beach, when\nthey leaped out and reached shore in safety.\nOneida Lake is about 300 miles west of Wallingford, and by taking into\naccount the difference in time, it was found that the accident to the boat and\nFrederic's vision or dream must have occurred within the same hour,\npossibly the same minute. The temperaments and disposition of these\nbrothers are unlike, and no uncommon affinity appears to exist between\nthem. Frederic is now living in Santa Anna, Cal., Charles in New York\nCity. B. Bristol.\nShort Beach.\nMr. Frederic Marks writes to Mr. Gale as follows :\u2014\nSanta Anna, Los Angeles Co., Cal., March 18th, 1889.\nThe incident you ask me to relate occurred fifteen or sixteen years\nago, and had passed out of mind till the reception of your letter. I was at\nthat time studying in New Haven, and had returned home and gone to my\nroom. I sat down on the side of my bed and soon dropped back on my\npillow. I do not think I fell asleep, nor did I seem fully awake. At once\nI seemed to be facing a severe storm of wind and rain. As I looked into\nthe storm a small boat with a sail came driven almost helplessly along\nthrough a seething, boiling mass of water. Two young men were in it, one\ntrying to steer and control the boat, the other apparently trying to dip out\nwater and work on the sail. One of the two, in a moment of greatest peril,\ntried to tear down the sail from its mast. The face of my brother came\nclearly into view with an expression on it that remains with me now. The\nboat righted and sped on. I saw a low shore that it was driving towards.\nThe boat grew fainter as it neared the shore, and consciousness came back\nto me, and whatever it was. whether a dream or vision, passed away. The\nother person in the boat, I learned afterwards, was Arthur Bloom\u2014a chum\nof my brother's.\nF. A. Marks.\nP.S.\u2014I purposely left untold that several days after the above occurrence\nI learned through a journal that \" Charles Marks and Arthur Bloom had a\nnarrow escape from drowning while out on Oneida Lake in a storm,\" thinking\nthat your correspondence with my brother would bring to light anything you\nwished to know.\n\fSupplement on the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 361\nMr. Charles Marks writes :\u2014\n5, Leonard-place, Albany, N.Y., March 31st, 1889.\nYour letter of the 22nd duly received. In reply I enclose the accounts,\nor letters, of myself and brother which were published in the local paper\nsome three months or so after the occurrence happened. I think of nothing\nfurther to add to this now.; only in answer to your query, \"whether you\nknew of your brother's apparently seeing the same at the time,\" would say,\nthat to the best of my recollection I was not conscious of my brother's seeing\nme. I think my thoughts and attention were solely engrossed on what I\nwas about, when standing on the seat and endeavouring to get down the sail,\nwhich is the moment when my brother saw me in his vision, or hallucination,\nas you have it. Knowing my brother's habits (he is an unusually strong and\nhealthy man) should say he was sound asleep at the time, for, with his\nhealthy robust constitution, when disposed he can go to sleep almost instantly\nduring the day time, and not unfrequently indulges in an afternoon nap.\nDuring his residence at Wallingford, Ct., he was a student at the Yale\nScientific School (Sheffield).\nC. R. Marks.\nThe following is the account published in the Oneida Circular,\nJanuary 19th, 1874:\u2014\nA Peril and a Vision.\nPerhaps our readers will remember an account in the Circular of a terrible\nstorm which two of our young men encountered last fall in a voyage on\nOneida Lake. Their adventure seems to have been a matter of interest in\nthe other world as well as in this. At any rate a brother of one of the\nvoyagers, living at Wallingford, two hundred miles distant, by some mystical\nillumination, saw them in the critical moment of their peril. Thinking that\nthe reality and the vision deserved to be brought together, we have obtained\nfrom the brothers the following details of their experiences :\u2014\nThe Peril.\nOn a beautiful day in October, Arthur Bloom and I sailed down the lake\nin a small open boat to Frenchman's Island, where we stayed over night.\nWhen we awoke next morning the wind was blowing hard, the clouds were\ndark and threatening, and the lake was rougher than I had ever seen it before.\nWe supposed it impossible to sail in such a sea, and so had resolved to wait\nfor the wind to go down ; but during the forenoon a boat with two men\nin it came to the island from the land about a mile away. As they landed\nnear us we asked one of them, who proved to be an old sailor, his opinion\nof our boat. He thought it was rather small, but said that it appeared to be\nwell made, and if it were his he would go where he chose. This was enough\nfor us. True, we knew little or nothing about sailing, and had before us a\nvoyage of eighteen miles up the lake to our Joppa station. \"But what of\nthat ? We shan't have a better chance to learn,\" said we. So for an experi\nmental trip we sailed to a small island a quarter of a mile away. Succeeding\nvery well in this, we concluded to make the homeward stretch. When we\nwere about to leave, our landlord cordially shook hands with us and inquired\nif we were good swimmers and \" dingers.\" On our replying we thought we\nwere, he comfortingly said if \"we kept a stiff upper-lip we might get\n2 B\n\f362 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nthrough all right \" ; at the same time his advice was decidedly against the\nventure. On leaving, which was at a quarter before three o'clock, we\nimagined the wind had slackened somewhat ; so we let out the sail to\nnearly its full capacity, as we wished, if possible, to get to the other end of\nthe lake before dark. Our positions were as follows : Arthur was in the\nstern of the boat, steering and tending the sail ; I was lying in the forward\npart, holding the halyards and ready for all work, such as baling, hauling\ndown sail, and dodging from one side to the other as the lurches of the boat\nand shifting of the sail demanded.\nWe started from the lee side of the island where the water was com\nparatively still ; but as we got out where we began to feel the full force of\nthe wind, we soon saw into what a scrape we had fallen. The little boat was\ndriving along at a fearful rate, throwing the water in sheets of foam from the\nbows ; and yet we knew the waves were comparatively moderate to what we\nmight expect when we should reach the middle of the lake. There was no\nchoice as to where we should go ; we could do but one thing, that is, go\nahead directly before the wind, which was driving us towards the upper end\nof the lake eighteen miles away. We were silent\u2014each busy with his own\nthoughts, preparing for the worst. To add to our apprehensions it began\nraining, and the wind instead of slacking was evidently increasing. We had\ngone about two miles when I was startled by a cry from Arthur to \"look out\nfor the sail ! \" as it was shifting to the other side. I lay down to let the sail\npass over me, and got on to the other side of the boat to counteract the\neffect of the sail. This is told in a few words, but the actual event seemed\nto take a long time. When down in the boat I heard and felt the swash of\nthe waves coming in, and for a moment I had the impression that Arthur\nwas already in the water and that it would soon be my turn. But on look\ning round I saw he was still in his place, and also that we had shipped con\nsiderable water. The next thing was to take in sail, and that quickly. I\nlet go the halyards, but the sail would not come down, as it was held by a\nmiserable toggle at the top. In the excitement of the moment I jumped\nupon the seat at the imminent risk of capsizing the boat, and pulled down\nthe sail as far as it would go, which left it about six feet high. This was\nstill dangerous, as the slack of the sail was distended, looking like a huge\nbag. This was remedied by cutting away the rings in the lower part of the\nsail and winding up the lower yard. After this, with considerable baling,\nwe got along tolerably well. We expressed our confidence in God, and a\ndesire to be reconciled to His will, and to learn the lesson which might be\nintended for us. Gradually our spirits rose, and we got considerable enjoy\nment from the rest of the voyage, especially the last five or six miles, when\nwe were passing swiftly by the houses and small towns on the beautiful\nnorthern shore. There was also to me a comical side to the adventure.\nArthur, who was steering with a rude paddle, could not stir from his position\nwithout very great risk ; while every few minutes the water would come\npouring in on his back, filling his pantaloons, and subduing any undue exulta\ntion. Our landing was quite thrilling. It was growing very dark when we\nturned in for the shore, where we supposed our home to be. We were soon\nrushing through a sea of foam ; then came a heavy lurch, followed by a\nviolent shock, which nearly sent us out of the boat. Then came a second\n\fSupplement on the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 363\nshock, when we jumped into the water and soon dragged our boat out of the\nway of the waves. We started for Joppa, which was about a mile from our\nlanding, with thankful hearts that we had escaped a terrible death, with no\ndamage worse than wet clothing. It was a quarter to six when we landed ;\nso that it took us just three hours to come up the lake, the same distance\nthat it took us full seven hours m going down the day before.\nCharles R. Marks.\nThe Vision.\nW. C, January Uth, 1874.\nDear H.,\u2014You wish the simple facts of my dream. They are these :\u2014\nOne afternoon in October, being tired, I lay down to rest. I soon fell\nasle'ep ; at least I have no reason for thinking that I did not sleep. I was\nnot on the bed more than a few minutes. During this time I dreamed of\nbeing near a large body of water. I knew it to be the Oneida Lake. The\nwind was blowing violently, and the waves ran exceedingly high. While\nstanding near the lake I felt under a strong disposition to sleep. My eyes\nwere heavy, they would close themselves. It was with an exertion that I\nkept them open. I was like a man under nightmare ; struggling to rouse\nmyself, yet only partially successful. Darkness was settling over me.\nSuddenly, when the wind was blowing a gale and the waves seemed rolling\none over the other, a small sail-boat broke upon my sight, driven wildly\nbefore the storm. For the moment it seemed as if it would be lost. It\nappeared to be at the mercy of the waves, for they rose high above its sides\nand almost concealed it at times. It was manned by two persons\u2014one in the\nafter part ; the other trying to pull down the sail ! Their situation was\ncritical. At this moment a feeling of horror shot through me as I recognised\nin the man whose full length I saw standing near the mast and struggling\nwith the sail my brother Charles ! The man in the stern I did not recognise.\nIn the time of the greatest peril, something\u2014I can scarcely tell what\u2014 I\ndare not call it an apparition\u2014gave me the impression that good beings were\ninterested and watchful over the voyagers.\nThe shock I received on seeing my brother did not allow me to sleep long.\nOn awaking I was troubled, and thought I would immediately write to\nCharles, entreating him to be careful. Afterwards, thinking it merely a\ndream, I turned my attention from writing, but I mentioned to Frank\nSmith that I had a troubled dream about Charles. After this experience,\nperhaps three or four days, a letter was received from Mrs. Mallory giving\nan account of Charles' condition when he returned to the Joppa station.1\nThis letter recalled the dream ; and the coincidence of time and circum\nstances made a deep impression on me, though I was unable then, and am\nnow, to accurately identify the time of my vision with the time of actual\nperil described in Mrs. Mallory's letter. (The letter, however, came so soon\nas to make it certain that the peril and the vision were nearly, if not\nexactly, simidtauemis. )\nOn my Late visit to O. O, I narrated my dream to Charles, and so true\nwas it to the facts that we were both convinced there was some spiritual\ntelegraphy that made me see his danger. Perhaps at that awful moment\nwhen he struggled with the sail he thought of me and his mother at\n1 Published in the Circular, October 27th, p. 349.\n2 B 2\n\fMrs. H. Sidgwiclc.\nWallingford, and on that thought the angels carried to me in my half-sleep\na picture of his situation, with an intimation of their care over him. Who\ncan suggest a hetter philosophy for the facts 1\nFrederic A. Marks.\nThe paragraph and letter published in the Oneida Circular for\nOctober 27th, 1873, need not be given here. They contain a brief\naccount of the adventure agreeing with the above.\nMr. B. Bristol wrote to Mr. Hodgson on February 24th, 1890,\nagain giving an account of the vision. He says: \"A summer shower\nhad driven us to the house. Frederic went upstairs, &c. . . . The\ndream or vision left him, and he came down not certain that he had\nbeen asleep. In the evening of the same day, when the family were:\nall together, the subject was discussed at some length. The general\nopinion was that it was merely a dream.\" I quote this to show that.\nMr. Bristol believes the vision to have been discussed before the news\nof the adventure was received.\nIt is worth considering whether \" the summer shower \"\u2014violent\nenough according to Mr. Bristol's recollection to drive the party into\nthe house\u2014may have resembled the storm sufficiently to produce a\ncommunity of ideas between the brothers, facilitating the telepathic\ncommunication.\nMr. Bristol adds about the brothers : \" Both are men of high\ncharacter, and their veracity will be unquestioned where they are\nknown.\"\nI proceed to the third and more definitely clairvoyant case.\n(M. 24.) We have received the following from our Corresponding\nMember, Dr. Alfred Backman, of Kalmar, who has kept the original\naccount of the brothers Suhr, sending us a translation.\nIn answer to a letter asking Mr. A. Suhr, photographer at Ystad, in\nSweden, whether he could remember anything about a hypnotic experiment\nmade by Mr. Hansen many years ago, in the presence of the brothers Suhr,\nDr. Backman received the following account :\u2014\n\"It was in the year 1867 that we, the undersigned brothers, were settled\nas photographers at Odense [in Denmark], and very often visited our common\nfriend, the hypnotist, Mr. Carl Hansen, who was living near us. A lawyer,\nMr. Balle, who is now an advocate in Copenhagen, and whom we met daily,\nwas strongly influenced hypnotically by Hansen, and wished one evening to\nbe put into so deep a hypnotic sleep as to become clairvoyant.\n\"The first time it happened was on the 16th of January, at 9.30 in the\nevening, as we can see from some notes taken at the time, and which wo still\npossess. Mr. Hansen made Mr. Balle sit down in a chair and lay his head\nback, and by steadily making passes he put him into a very deep sleep. Mr.\nHansen showed that when he opened the eyelids one could only see the\nwhite of the eye, declaring the pupils to be turned inwards. Mr. Hansen\ntook his hand and asked him if he could hear what he said, and having\nrepeated the question several times, got the answer ' Yes,' but with a hollow\n\fSupplement on the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 3(65\nand toneless voice. Mr. Hansen now tried whether he could see with his\nforehead, holding a small bottle over his head and asking if he could see\nwhat it was. Mr. Hansen having breathed on his forehead and several\ntimes repeated the question, Mr. Balle said correctly that it was a little bottle.\nHe then took other objects, which Mr. Balle also saw. Hansen now believing\nBalle to be clairvoyant made him go mentally to other places to see and tell\nhim what he saw. He put different questions to him about persons and\nthings, which Balle answered correctly and in accordance with the fact, but\nas it would take too long to tell them all, and as they were of minor impor\ntance, we will confine ourselves to some examples that seem to us to be\nspecially important, and for the truth and trustworthiness of which we are\nanswerable.\n\"I. We had a relative, Officer of Woods and Forests, Carl Bloch, who lived\nabout two miles [about 12 English miles.\u2014Backmatt] from Odense, at the\ncountry house Langesoe, but unknown to both Hansen and Balle ; we also\nknew that neither of them had ever visited our relative. We wished then\nto know how he and his wife were, and asked Hansen to make Balle go to\nthem and see. The questions and answers ran as follows :\u2014\n\" Hansen : ' Go to the place of which I am now thinking and try to find\nthe person of whom I am thinking but whom I have never seen. '\n\"Balle: 'Now I am there. A little man, with moustaches, is sitting in a\nroom and is reading in the Dagbladet about the naval captain Muscholdt and\nBothe ; he is reading aloud ; now he speaks ; he says, \" It is ridiculous that\nthe Government should not have given Rothe the same\u2014such is the reac\ntionary business. \" There is also a lady present who is sewing, and a little\nboy. Now he falls, but that did not hurt him\u2014he stands up again now. The\nlady says, \" It is astonishing that Valdemar has not let us hear anything of\nhimself ! What was it that he meant to bring us ? \" He answers, \"I don't\nknow, but he will explain when he comes again. \" '\n'' Hansen : ' What is the room like ? ' Balle : ' Very nice. Four arm\nchairs or \"Pouffes.\" A drawing, which I know, is hanging over the sofa\u2014\na dog.1\n\"Hansen: 'Are there other pictures ? ' Balle : ' Yes, a hunting piece, a\nstag.' Hansen : 'Is there nothing else remarkable?' Balle: 'Oh, yes, there\nis no mirror.' Hansen: 'What colour are the walls?' Balle: ' They are red.'\nHansen: 'Are they good people?' Balle: 'Yes, very good, excellent people.'\n' ' We may remark that the description of the persons and the room was\ncompletely correct.\"\nSo far, as we do not know that the actual conversation, &c, at\nLangesoe was correctly described, we cannot say that Mr. Balle's\nstatements involved knowledge not in the mind of any person present.\nBut in the next experiment we get beyond this.\n\"II. Our mother lived at that time at Roeskilde, in Seeland. We\nasked Hansen to cause Balle to visit her. It was late in the evening, and\nafter some hesitation on Mr. Balle's part he made the journey in a few\n1 The undersigned Valdemar Bloch Suhr had in reality sketched the dog of the\nwood-officer Bloch, and given the drawing to him. Balle had really seen me work\ning at the drawing, and my relative had hung it over his sofa in a frame.\n\f366 Mrs. H. Sidgwick.\nminutes. He found our mother sick and in bed, but with a slight cold only,\nwhich would pass off in a short time. We did not believe this to be true,\nand Hansen asked Balle to read on the corner of the house the name of the\nstreet. Balle said it was too dark to read, but Hansen insisted and he read\n' Skomagerstraede.' We believed this to be quite wrong, for we knew that\nour mother lived in quite a different street. After several days we got a letter\nfrom our mother, saying that she had been sick and had removed to\nSkomagerstraede.\n\"III. The undersigned, V. B. Suhr's wife, then Miss Clara Vilhelmine\nChristensen, was witness to a third experiment.\n\" My wife lived at this time at Stora Goothaab, a large farm which lies\non the Goothaab road, near Copenhagen, but she had gone to Odense to see\na relative and Mr. Hansen and his wife, who, as already stated, were at that\ntime settled at Odense. The seance took place in the before-mentioned\nroom.\n\" My wife wished to know how things were at home, at Stora Goothaab, in\nthe house of the telegraphic engineer, Schjotz, with whose family she lived,\nand she therefore asked Mr. Hansen to ask Mr. Balle about it. She knew\nvery well that neither Mr. Hansen nor Mr. Balle had ever been at the place\nin question. Mr. Hansen now took a letter written by my wife and put\nit on the forehead of the hypnotised Mr. Balle, saying : ' Try to find the\nplace where the writer of this letter lives.' Balle: 'It is, of course, not\nnecessary, she is here in the room.' Mr. Hansen now insisted strongly that\nMr. Balle must find the house, and after some reluctance, first because he\nmust cross the water (the Hora Bait), and then because, as he said, when he\nreached the Goothaab road, ' It is so dark here.' ' Lighten up your spirit\nand see,' said Hansen, and Balle went on. 'Now I am here,' he said a\nlittle later. Hansen: 'What do you see?' Balle: 'It is like a castle.'\nH. : ' Go in to the house. ' B. : ' Here are broad stairs. ' H. : ' All right ! Now\nyou must go into the lady's room.' B. : ' There is nobody there.' H. : 'Is\nthere no living creature 1 ' B. : ' Oh yes ! a canary bird in a cage. ' H. :\n' Where is it standing V B. : Upon a chest of drawers.' My wife remarked\nthat this was not right, because the cage always stood in the window, but\nBalle insisted upon it.\n\"There were four children in the family, and my wife wished to know how\nit fared with them. H. : ' Go in to the family and see how the children are. '\nB.: ' Here are two\u2014in bed. ' H. : ' You must find more. ' Balle searched much\nto find the others ; at last he exclaimed : ' Here is one more ! Oh no, it is a\ndoll, ' he said indignantly, and moved his hand as though ho were throwing\nsomething away. In spite of Mr. Hansen's insistence, Mr. Balle continued\nto be unable to find more than two children. But he found a lady in bed and\nvery ill, nearly dying. My wife knew this to be correct. It was a Miss\nMarie Kruse, a sister of Mrs. Schjotz. She was very ill when my wife left\nCopenhagen, and the doctor did not think she could live as she was con\nsumptive in the highest degree. H. : ' How is it with Miss Kruse 1 '\nB. : ' She is very ill. ' H. : ' Will she die or recover ? ' B. : ' She will recover. '\n\" When my wife went back to Stora Goothaab she said nothing about\nwhat had occurred, but asked Miss Caroline Kruse, another sister of Mrs.\nSchjotz, if her canary bird had been well while she was away, and if he\n\fSupplement on the Evidence, for Clairvoyance. 367\nalways stood in the window. Miss Kruse answered that he had always been in\nthe same place in the window except at night ; then she had put him on the\nchest of drawers to save him from the cold. And about the children she\nsaid that two of them, just on the days in question, had been visiting their\nfather's brother, the tobacco manufacturer Schjotz, Kjobmagergade-street,\nCopenhagen. The sick lady is still alive, and has been for many years\nmanager in a large and well thought-of school for girls at Fredriksbergs\nAlle, near Copenhagen.\n\"Signed in witness of the truth of the above,\n\"Anton Vilhelm Suhr, Photographer,\n\" Ystad [Sweden]. August 30th, 1891.\n\"Valdemar Bloch Suhr, Dramatic Artist and Painter.\"\nIn answer to inquiries, Mr. Anton Suhr tells me on a postcard, dated\nOctober 9th, 1891: \"The notes that you have got are an abridgment of\nthe protocol (my brother has it in his possession, and he wrote it at the clair-,\nvoyant experiments) and are in just the same words.\"\nAlfred Backman.\nWe first heard of this case of clairvoyance from Mr. Hansen, who\nkindly wrote out for us the following account of his own recollection\nof the circumstance, and referred us to Mr. Anton Suhr for confirma\ntion. It was some time before we had the opportunity of communi\ncating with Mr. Suhr in Swedish.\nMay 13th, 1889.\nIn conversation with Dr. A. T. Myers I happened to mention an instance\nof what I consider independent clairvoyance. Dv. Myers then requested\nme to put it down in writing. I now proceed to do so and shall endeavour\nto record the facts as concisely as I can, believing that my memory serves me\ncorrectly ; should I, however, make any mistakes, then these may be rectified\nby two gentlemen who were present at the occurrence and whose names I\nshall give.\nIn the year 1867 I was living in Odense, Denmark, and often received\nvisits from two young gentlemen established in that town as photographers ;\nthey are brothers, the elder one named Valdemar Bloch Suhr, the younger\none Anton Suhr, sons of a famous landscape gardener, and nephews of the\nthen favourite preacher, the Rev. Bloch Suhr, at Helliggeistes Church,\nCopenhagen. Besides these, I often saw, as a visitor in my house, a\nyoung man named Valdemar Balle, who is now established as a lawyer in\nCopenhagen.\nOn several occasions I had hypnotised Mr. Balle but only tried to let him\nfall into the hypnotic state characterised by lethargy and anaesthesia, or else\nto induce illusions or hallucinations, in fact the experiments had been made\nmore for the entertainment of my two friends, the brothers Suhr, than for\nany purpose of investigation. Mr. Balle, however, who at that time was\nstudying and working very hard, felt himself very much refreshed and\nstrengthened after each magnetic sleep, and would sometimes ask me to put\nhim to sleep for a short time, after which he generally felt very lively and\ntook a very active part in the conversation. On two or three such occasions\nhe gave, during his sleep, indications of clairvoyance, the circumstances,\n\f368 Mrs. H. Sidgtvick.\nhowever, have been forgotten by me ; may be that my friend, Bloch Suhr, who\nhas an excellent memory, can remember them. The following occurrence,\nhowever, stands clear in my memory.\nOne evening, when I had hypnotised Mr. Balle, and he was fast asleep in\nan easy-chair, the elder of the brothers Suhr requested me to try if Balle\nmentally could travel to Roskilde, a town in Seeland, distant about 75 or 80\nEnglish miles, 16 of which are sea, and there see if Suhr's mother was well.\nI consented to try, and told Balle to go to Roskilde. He at first was unwilling\nto do so ; afterwards he said, \" I am in Nyborg \" (a town 16 miles distant)\n\" but I do not like to cross the water, it is so dark.\" I told him not to mind\nbut to go on to Roskilde. Shortly after he said, \" I am in Roskilde.\"\n\" Well then, find Mrs. Suhr,\" was my reply. The moment after he said that\nhe was standing outside Mrs. Suhr's abode. I asked him, in order to verify\nhis correctness, \"Where does she live ? \" He gave me the name of the street,\nand, if I remember rightly, said it was the corner house.\nAs I did not know Mrs. Suhr nor her address, I looked round at Mr.\nSuhr, my face expressing the question, \"Is it correct ? \" but Suhr shook his\nhead and made such gestures as told me that the clairvoyant was mistaken.\nI then said to Balle that he was mistaken and should look again. He, how\never, in a rather indignant tone of voice, told me he was not mistaken, say\ning, \"What ! cannot I read ? There, the name of the street is written, you can\nsee it yourself.\" I believe the name of the street was. Skomagerstrcede, but\nam not sure of this. I remember, however, that the two brothers Suhr both\ntold me it was the wrong street. As the clairvoyant, however, seemed\noffended at my trying to correct him, I made no more remark to him about\nwhat we thought his mistake, but requested him to enter the house and see\nif Mrs. Suhr was well. He at first seemed unwilling, and made the excuse\nthat the door was shut. I told him not to mind, but to go in all the same.\n\"I am in,\" was his next reply, and then I asked him, How is Mrs. Suhr?\n\" She is in bed, not quite well; the illness, however, is of no moment; it is\nonly a slight cold. She is thinking of Valdemar; she will write him a letter,\nand there are three things she will write about.\" He then mentioned three\nthings relating to business. What they were I have forgotten. I then woke\nhim up, the brothers Suhr remarking that the information he had given was of\nno value as there was a decided mistake in it, namely, with regard to then-\nmother's address, as she did not live where Balle had said. I believe it\nwas two days after when Valdemar Suhr received a letter from his mother,\n,which proved that Mr. Balle had been in the right. Mrs. Suhr had, namely,\nremoved to the house mentioned by Balle during the hypnotic state without\nher sons having any idea that she was going to do so. She had really had a\nslight cold, and she did write to her son about the three matters mentioned\nby Balle, and, as I remember being told, nearly in the same words he had\nused.\nNow, I must mention that neither Mr. Balle nor I knew anything of Mrs.\nSuhr. We had never seen her ; neither of us had ever been in the town\nRoskilde, nor did we know the names of the streets there ; therefore, it\nseems to me that there could be no telepathy in this case, as the clairvoyant\ncould not read an address we had no idea about, nor would it be likely to\ncome into his brain from any unconscious memory. In fact, I have looked at\n\fSupplement on the Evidence for Clairvoyance. 369\nthe case from all the points of view that I can, and it seems to me that the\nfinding of the town and the address are pure clairvoyance, whereas from the\nmoment the clairvoyant entered the room of Mrs. Suhr, he seems to have\nbecome a thought-reader.\nCarl Hansen, Hypnotiseur.\nWe have in this case three definite facts mentioned by the clair\nvoyant which were unknown to all present and not, so far as we can\nsee, likely to be guessed ;\u2014namely, the street in which Mrs. Suhr lived,\nthe position of the canary, and the absence of the children. And the\nlast one, as described, looks more like independent clairvoyance than\nany kind of thought-reading, because had Mr. Balle obtained his\ninformation from the mind of any person at Stora Goothaab one would\nsuppose that he would at once have said, \"The other children are away,\"\ninstead of mentally searching the house and not finding them.\n\f370 F. W. H. Myers.\nIII.\nNOTE ON A VISIT TO KALMAR.\nBy P. W. H. Myers.\nThe account given in Part XIX. of Dr. Backman's experiments\nwith several clairvoyantes will no doubt have awakened the interest\nand curiosity of our readers. Dr. Backman, it will be remembered,\nbegan by disclaiming scientific precision in his earlier and more striking\nexperiments, which were made before the full importance of the inquiry\nwas realised. He readily complied, however, with our request that he\nwould continue his researches as soon as practicable, and he was kind\nenough to offer a welcome to any of us who might care personally to\nwitness further trials of the same kind. In response to this invitation,\na party, consisting of Professor Richet, M. Houdaille, Dr. A. T. Myers,\nand myself disembarked atKalmar on August 12th.1\nWe were most cordially received, and were allowed to witness and\nto conduct experiments with all the subjects at the time attainable.\nAmong these, however, Alma Radberg was the only one whom we\nwere able to see sufficiently often to overcome the shyness and timidity\nwhich stood in the way of a fair trial in the presence of strangers.\nEven with Alma there was much difficulty of this kind ; and we do\nnot consider that our own series of experiments was long enough to\njustify an independent conclusion ;\u2014although, as will be seen, we had\ntwo successes decidedly corroborative of Dr. Backman's results. Per\nhaps the most important outcome of our visit was the conviction which\nwe all of us gained as to the absolute candour and disinterested desire\nfor truth with which Dr. Backman's experiments are conducted, and\nthe simplicity and good faith of the subjects whom he employs.\nI will now recount two experiments which we class as at least\npartial successes. In the first of them the conditions were slightly\ndefective ; in the second they were, I think, satisfactory.\nExperiment I. August 15th.\u2014Alma lightly hypnotised by Dr.\nBackman. Professor Richet gives her a letter written in French, which\nshe does not know, and so folded as to be unreadable. This she holds\nin one hand, with shut eyes.\n\" This letter,\" she says, \" comes from a long way off ; from a man.\nof middle age, dark, but not extremely so ; high forehead, curved nose,\n1 This paper has been revised by Professor Richet and Dr. A. T. Myers.\n\fNote on a Visit to Kalmar. 371\na teacher ; hair very short, small beard ; moustache and imperial,\nwhiskers small or none. He rests one hand on his hip, and seems to\nstoop slightly to one side.\n\" The letter asks for information ; something about time ; when\nsomething will happen or be done ; it is a rendezvous ; several persons\nare to meet ; one of them is tall and very dark ; the meeting is about\na journey ; the tall dark man is M. Richet, or is like him ; they are to\nmeet in a town and to have a conference.\"\nAlma was then awakened ; but (as usual with Dr. Backman's sub\njects) she remembered her trance-sensations, and was able to add\nfurther details.\n\" The writer has marked features ; a noticeable face ; aged about\n45 or 50, name of three syllables, beginning with R. or B. His hair\nis dark brown with some grey in it.\"\nNow this letter was in fact from Professor Nicolas G., of Moscow,\nasking Professor Richet when he would be in Moscow, and inviting\nhim and myself to meet him in Moscow and make a trip to his\ncountry-seat and other places ;\u2014the primary object of the meeting\nbeing a kind of \" conference.\" The description of Professor G. is also\npractically correct.\nThe account given, therefore, was satisfactory on almost all points\nexcept the name of the writer.\nThis experiment was tried on the spur of the moment, when Alma\nfailed in reading cards placed back upwards upon her lap ; and the con\nditions were defective in the following ways :\u2014(1) \"I had already,\"\nsays M. Richet, \" half an hour before, handed the letter to Mr. Myers\nto read, and he had replied 'good.' Alma, who was asleep at the time,\nhad not remarked this, and was absolutely ignorant that the letter\nhanded to her was the same.\" (2) M. Richet, who knew the contents\nof the letter, remained in the room, although he took care to say\nnothing and to give no indication. He sat with his back turned, and\nhis face to the wall. (3) I, who took notes, knew the contents of the\nletter ; but I checked my notes by those of Dr. Myers, who did not\nknow the contents.\nExperiment II.\u2014It is easy to avoid these possibilities of unconscious\nsuggestion; and on August 17th, after more failures with cards, we tried\nthe impressions derived from letters under more careful conditions.\nM. Richet handed to me a letter unknown to me, and left the room. I\ngave it to Alma to hold, and took down notes of what she said (as\ntranslated from Swedish into French by Dr. Backman), which notes I\ncompleted before I learnt anything of the letter. There was thus no\npossibility of unconscious suggestion.\nAlma's words, then, were as follows :\u2014\n\f372 F. W. H. Myers.\n\" The writer expresses a desire.

It is a\nthing which will be decided when the persons meet ;\u2014something scien\ntific which will be settled.\"\nThe letter related to a flying-machine which Professor Richet is\nengaged in constructing with the aid of the friend who writes. I sub\njoin a translation :\u2014\n\"Paris, April Uth, 1891.\n\" My dear Friend,\u2014I had left Havre when your letter arrived\nthere, but have now received it in Paris. As I telegraphed to you, we\nhad satisfactory weather on Wednesday evening and on Thursday till\n10 a.m. We tried the small machine, which behaved much better than\nits still smaller brothers ; but, nevertheless, it always turned over on\nthe same side. This seems to result from the current of air on the\nbeach. It made nearly the same journey as our large machine last\nyear, and fell in about the same spot. The working of the blades was\nabsolutely perfect.\"\nA criticism on a rival flying-machine concludes the letter. There\nis no actual appointment of a meeting ; but Professor Richet says that\nthe need of a meeting between himself and his friend is clearly im\nplied. The machine is in fact roughly oblong and screw-shaped, and\npartly metallic ; but the great model is larger than described by Alma ;\nnor do the wings open and shut.\nOn the whole, however, and considering the absolute unexpected\nness of the subject-matter to Alma, the coincidences are striking\nenough.\nWe tried Alma with two other letters, but her accounts of these\nwere vague and incorrect.\nExperiments of this kind are no doubt less definite and cogent than\nexperiments in the naming of cards, numbers, names,\u2014or something\nwhich admits of a definite calculation of chances. If a clairvoyante\ncould correctly name an unseen card six times running, the possibility of\nclairvoyance would be quickly settled. But we know too little of the\n\fNotes on a Visit to Kalmar. 373\nnature of this obscure power to allow us to demand any one feat as the\ncondition of our belief. It is possible that supernormal knowledge\nmay reach the percipient less readily when of a purely impersonal kind\n(as of a card in an envelope) than when it has some vivid connection\nwith other minds, as with a letter from a person at a distance. We\nare bound to try all methods, trusting to care and repetition to over\ncome the evidential weaknesses to which each method is liable.\nOne more word may be added as to the temper of mind in which\nthese inquiries should be carried on. Where proper conditions have\nbeen agreed upon beforehand, and are strictly observed, it may very\nlikely be, as Dr. Backman thinks, a positive advantage that the\noperator should vividly believe that the rarer phenomena are likely to\nappear. We do not yet know the whole power of suggestion ; and\nmuch as the Salpetriere subjects are unconsciously trained into a cer\ntain sequence of physical conditions rarely observed elsewhere, so also\nmay it be possible for the operator's expectation to stimulate the\nsubject's hypnotic self into the exercise of a lucidity which might else\nhave remained dormant.\nThe fact that these higher phenomena so seldom appear may thus be\nlargely due to the fact that they are so little believed in, and so seldom\nlooked for. In this, as in so many branches of our research, the one\nthing needful is to substitute careful, widespread, persistent experi\nment for the loose talk, whether of credulity or of negation, which is.\nalready to hand in quite sufficient quantity.\nTo Dr. Backman the thanks of serious students are already due ;\u2014\nand will be due in still larger measure if his engagements should allow\nhim to carry on systematically the series of experiments so promisingly\nbegun.\n\f374 Oliver J. Lodge.\nIV.\nSOME RECENT THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE EXPERIMENTS.\nBy Oliver J. Lodge.\nWhile staying for a fortnight this autumn in the house of Herr\nvon Lyro, at Portschach am See, Carinthia, I found that his two adult\ndaughters were adepts in the so-called \" willing-game,\" and were\naccustomed to entertain their friends by the speed and certainty with\nwhich they could perform actions decided on by the company ; the\noperator being led either by one or by two others, and preferring to be\nled by someone to whom she was accustomed. Another lady staying\nin the house was said to be able to do things equally well, but not\nwithout nervous prostration.\nOn the evening when I witnessed the occurrences nothing done\ncould be regarded as conclusive against muscle-reading, though the\nspeed and accuracy with which the willed action was performed exceeded\nany muscle-reading that I had previously seen, and left me little doubt\nbut that there was some genuine thought-transference power.\nAccordingly I obtained permission to experiment in a more satis\nfactory manner, and on several occasions tested the power of the two\nsisters, using one as agent and the other as percipient alternately. Once\nor twice a stranger was asked to act as agent, but without success.\nThe operations were conducted in an ordinary simple manner.\nOne of the sisters was placed behind a drawing board, erected by me\non a temporary sort of easel, while the other sat in front of the same\nboard; and the objects or drawings to be guessed were placed on a ledge\nin front of it, in full view of the one and completely hidden from the\nother.\nNaturally I attended to the absence of mirrors and all such obvious\nphysical complications. The percipient preferred to be blindfolded, but\nno precaution was taken with reference to this blindfolding. Agent\nand percipient were within reach of one another, and usually held each\nother's hands across a small table. The kind and amount of contact\nwas under control, and was sometimes broken altogether, as is sub\nsequently related.\nThe ladies were interested in the subject, and were perfectly willing\nto try any change of conditions that I suggested, and my hope was\ngradually to secure the phenomenon without contact of any kind, as I\nhad done in a previous case (Vol. II., p. 189); but unfortunately in the\n\fSome Recent Thought-Transference Experiments, 375\npresent instance contact seemed essential to the transfer. Very slight\ncontact was sufficient, for instance through the backs of the knuckles;\nbut directly the hands were separated, even though but a quarter of an\ninch, the phenomena ceased, to reappear again directly contact was\nestablished. I tried whether I could bridge over the gap effectively\nwith my own, or another lady's, hand; but that did not do. I also once\ntried both sisters blindfolded, and holding each other by one hand, while\ntwo other persons completed the chain and tried to act as agents.\nAfter a time the sisters were asked to draw, simultaneously and indepen.\ndently, what they had \"seen\"; but though the two drawings were close\nimitations of each other, they bore no likeness to the object on which\nthe agents had been gazing. (See Plates at the end of this paper;\nPlate I., R. 1 (a) and R. 1 (6).) My impression, therefore, is that\nthere is some kind of close sympathetic connexion between the sisters,\nso that an idea may, as it were, reverberate between their minds when\ntheir hands touch, but that they are only faintly, if at all, susceptible\nto the influence of outside persons.\nWhether the importance of contact in this case depends upon the\nfact that it is the condition to which they have always been accus\ntomed, or whether it is a really effective aid, I am not sure. I have\nexplained to them the desirability of securing the results without\ncontact, if possible, and it may happen that with some practice they\nwill find themselves able to dispense with it. The time at our joint\ndisposal was limited, and I was not able to do more than set things in\ntrain for more striking success later, provided they try experiments\noccasionally and do not get tired of them.\nSo far as my own observation went, it was interesting and new to\nme to see how clearly the effect seemed to depend on contact, and how\nabruptly it ceased when contact was broken. While guessing through\na pack of cards, for instance, rapidly and continuously, I sometimes\nallowed contact and sometimes stopped it ; and the guesses changed,\nfrom frequently correct to quite wild, directly the knuckles or finger\ntips, or any part of the skin of the two hands, ceased to touch. It was\nalmost like breaking an electric circuit. At the same time, partial\ncontact seemed less effective than a thorough hand grasp.\nIt is perfectly obvious how strongly this dependence on contact\nsuggests the idea of a code ; and I have to admit at once that this flaw\nprevents this series of observations from having any value as a test\nease, or as establishing de novo the existence of the genuine power. My\npaper only appeals to those who, on other grounds, have accepted the\ngeneral possibility of thought-transference, and who, therefore, need not\nfeel unduly strained when asked to credit my assertion that unfair\npractices were extremely unlikely; and that, apart from this moral con\nviction, there was a sufficient amount of internal evidence derived from\n\f376 Oliver J. Lodge.\nthe facts themselves to satisfy me that no code was used. The\ninternal evidence of which I am thinking was : (1) the occasionally\nsuccessful reproduction of nameless drawings ; (2) the occasional failure\nto get any clue to an object or drawing with a perfectly simple and\neasily telegraphed name ; (3) the speed with which the guesses were\noften made.\nI wish, however, distinctly to say that none of the evidence which.\nI can offer against a prearranged code is scientifically and impersonally\nconclusive, nor could it be accepted as of sufficient weight by a sceptic on\nthe whole subject. It is only because, with full opportunity of forming\na judgment, and in the light of my former experience, I am myself\nsatisfied that what I observed was an instance of genuine sympathetic-\nor syntonic communication, and because such cases seem at the present\ntime to be rather rare, that I make this brief report on the circum\nstances.\nI detected no well-marked difference between the powers of the two\nsisters, and it will be understood that one of them was acting as agent\nand the other as percipient in each case. Sometimes the parents of the\ngirls were present, but often only one or two friends of my own, who\nwere good enough to invite the young ladies to their sitting-room for\nthe purpose of experiment ; though such experiments are, when\ncarefully performed, confessedly rather tedious and dull.\nIn the early willing-game experiments, such things were done as\ntaking a particular ring from one person's hand and putting it on\nanother's ; selecting a definite piece of music from a pile, taking it to\nthe piano, and beginning to play it. The last item (the beginning to\nplay) I did not happen to witness, but I was told of it by several\npersons as more than could be accounted for by muscle-reading. A\nsceptic, however, could of course object that imperfect bandaging would\neasily enable a title to be read.\nOne of the things I suggested was aimed at excluding the operation\nof unconscious muscular guidance as far as possible, and it consisted in\ndesiring that the lady while standing in the middle of the room should\nkick off her shoes without touching them and begin to sing a specified\nsong. Success, however, was only partial. After one or two attempts\nto wander about the room as usual, she did shuffle a shoe off, but though\nshe did not actually touch her feet she stooped so that the held hand\ncame very near them. She then stood some little time uncertain what\nto do next, and at last broke silence by saying \" Shall I sing 1 \"\nThe first attempt at the more careful experiments was not at all\nsuccessful, but novelty of conditions may fairly be held responsible for\nthat. On the second and subsequent evenings . success was much more\nfrequent : on the whole, I think, more frequent than failure. I proceed\nto give a fairly complete account of the whole series.\n\fSome Recent Thought-Transference Experiments. 377\nThe first object was a teapot ; but there was no result.\nThe first drawing was the outline of a box with a flag at one comer ;\nbut that produced no impression.\nNext, for simplicity, I explained that the object this time was a\nletter (Buchstabe), on which it was correctly guessed E. Another letter,\nM, was given quite wrong. A childish back-view outline of a cat was\ngiven oval like an egg ; some other things were unperceived.\nOn the second evening I began by saying that the object was a\ncolour ; on which red was instantly and correctly stated.\nA blue object which followed was guessed wrong.\nAn outline figure of a horse was correctly named. So was the\nletter B. I then drew a square with a diagonal cross in it and a round\nring or spot just above the cross, the whole looking something like the\nback of an envelope. After a certain interval of silence (perhaps two\nminutes) the lady said she was ready to draw what she had \"seen\/' and\ndrew the thing almost exactly, except that the dot was put right on\nthe centre of the cross instead of above it, and a superfluous faint\nvertical stroke was added. (See Plate I., O. 2 and R. 2.) Its possible\nresemblance to an envelope was not detected, nor did the reproduction\nsuggest the idea : it was drawn as, and looked like, a nameless\ngeometrical figure.\nThe reproductions were nearly always much smaller in size than the\noriginals. The agent did not look on while the reproduction was being\nmade. It is best for no one to look on while the percipient draws, to\navoid the possibility of unconscious indications. The original drawings\nwere always made by me, sometimes before, sometimes during the sitting.\nThese conditions were all satisfactory.\nOn the third evening I began with a pack of cards, running through\nthem quickly ; with 2 reporters, one recording the card held up, the\nother recording the guess made, without knowing whether it was right\nor wrong. I held up the cards one after the other and gave no indica\ntion whether the guesses were right or wrong. The suit was not\nattempted, so that the chances of error were, I suppose, 12 to 1.\nOn comparing the two lists afterwards, out of 16 guesses only 6 were\nwrong. Full contact was allowed during this series. The lists are\nreproduced below.\nThe card guessing is obviously not of the slightest use unless bona\nfides are certain, but, given that, it affords the readiest method of study\ning the effect of varied conditions, interposed obstacles, and such like.\nThe whole pack was always used and I simply cut it at random and\nheld up the bottom card. About 10 or 12 cards could be got through\nin a minute.\nThe following -is the list of the first card series. Full contact\nallowed :\u2014\n\f378 Oliver J. Lodge.\nCARD LOOKED AT.

Four\nThus, out of the sixteen trials, 10 were correct and 6 were wrong.\nSome guesses were made, both with cards and objects, on another\nevening, without contact, but none were successful. With contact\nthere was success again.\nI then went back to simple drawings ; with the result that a cross\nwas reproduced as a cross (Plate II., O. 3 and R. 3) ; a figure like\n4 petals was reproduced in two ways, one of them being a vague.\n5-petalled figure. (Plate II., O. 4 and R. 4.)\nAn object consisting of an ivory measure standing on end like an\ninverted V was drawn as shown in the diagram, Plate II., R. 5 (\u00ab) and\nR. 5 (b).\nA sinuous line was reproduced as a number of sinuous lines\n(Plate III., O. 6 and R. 6) ; a triangle or wedge, point downward, was\nreproduced imperfectly. (Plate III., O. 7 and R. 7.)\nOn other evenings more of the same sort of thing were tried, such\nas the diagram marked O. 8, reproduced as R. 8 (a) and R. 8 (b)\n(Plate IV.) ; a face, reproduced as 3 rounds with dots and cross\n(Plate IV., 0. 9 and R. 9) ; and a figure like an A with an extra long\ncross stroke, which could be easily signalled as an A, but which was\nreproduced correctly as a geometrical diagram with the long stroke\nprominent. (Plate V., O. 10 and R. 10 (a), (b) and (c).)\nA circle with 3 radii reproduced as a circle with roughly inscribed\ntriangle. (Plate V., O. 11 and R. 11.)\nThe number 3145 reproduced orally and very quickly as 3146 ;\n715 also quickly as \"714, no 715.\" The written word hund repro\nduced correctly, but with a capital initial letter.\nAnd being told that they had previously thus reproduced a word\nan unknown language (not unknown character), viz., Hungarian, I\nin\n\fSome Recent Thought-Transference Experiments. 379\ntried the Greek letters *tu8w ; this, however, was considered too puzzling\nand was only reproduced as Uaso. A French high-heeled shoe, made of\ncrockery, being set up as object, it was drawn by the percipient very\nfairly correctly, and said to be something like a boot, and a protuber\nance was tacked on where the heel was. (Plate V., R. 12.)\nA white plaster cast of a child's hand, next tried, failed to give any\nimpression. An unlighted candle in candlestick was unsuccessful, and\nit was objected that there was too much glare of light. Subsequently\nthe percipient said she had seen the general outline of a candlestick but\ndid not think of its being the thing. A teapot and a cup both failed,\nand two of the drawings did not succeed in getting any colourable\nimitation. Lastly, another set of card trials were made, with the\nobject of testing the effect of various kinds of contact : a card series\nbeing quick and easy to run through.\nCARD\nEXHIBITED\nTO AGENT.\nFull contact with both \/ Nine . . .\nhands I King ...\nKnave...\nContact with tips\nfingers only\nof\nContact with one\nfinger of one hand..\nNine ...\n.{ Nine ...\nQueen . . .\nI Eight ...\nfFive ...\nSeven ...\nThree ...\nTen ...\nQueen ...\nAce\nNo contact \/^ce \u2014\n(.Knave...\nNo direct contact, but (\"King ...\ngap bridged by other < Four ...\nperson's hand I Ten . . .\nSlight contact of f Eight ...\nknuckles \\ Slx -\niTwo ...\nKnave...\nFull contact again.\nSeven\nThree\nFour\nAce of diamonds\nNine of clubs held sideways .\nThe record of this series is more complete than that of another\nvarying contact series, but it did not strike me as so instructive at\nCARD\nNAMED BY\nPERCIPIENT.\n.

One hand of each person lay on a table, and I sometimes\nmade them touch, sometimes separated them, all the time going on\nwith the card series. My impression at the time was, as expressed\nabove, that pronounced failure began directly I broke contact, but that\nmere knuckle contact was sufficient to permit some amount of success.\nI can only give the record as it stands.

Towards the end of a series,\nfatigue on the part of either agent or percipient generally seemed to\nspoil the conditions.\nIt is manifest that these experiments should not be conducted\ntoo long consecutively, nor repeated without sufficient interval ; but\nif common sense is used there is nothing deleterious in the attempt,\nand if more persons tried, probably the power would be found more\nwidely distributed than is at present suspected.\nI wish to express gratitude to the Fraulein von Lyro and their\nparents, for the courtesy with which they acquiesced in my request for\nopportunities of experiment, and for the willingness with which they\nsubmitted to dull and irksome conditions, in order to enable me to give\nas good evidence as possible to the Society.\nThe illustrations whichfollow are traced from drawings and repro\nductions made in the experiments, but though facsimiles in form they\ndo not always represent satisfactorily the relative clearness andfainlness\nofsome of the lines. 0. in all cases stands for Original dratving, and\nJtt. for Reproduction.\n\f\f\f\f\f\fHL\n0.6\nH. 6\n\f\f\f\f\f\fAlleged Movements, &c. 383\nV.\nON ALLEGED MOVEMENTS OF OBJECTS, WITHOUT\nCONTACT, OCCURRING NOT IN THE PRESENCE\nOF A PAID MEDIUM.\nBy Frederic W. H. Myers.\nPart II.\nIn Part XIX. of these Proceedings I began a review of certain\ncases of physical movements of objects which it seemed difficult to\nexplain by ordinary laws. I divided these cases roughly into four\nclasses, premising that the lines of demarcation were often indistinct.\nIn Class A I placed movements which seemed a development of\nautomatism, referable, apparently (if not to ordinary causes), to some\npower residing in the automatist or \" medium \" himself, with no\nconvincing indication of any external source. The twelve cases\nwhich I quoted all belonged to Class A. Class B was to contain\ncases of movement apparently connected with the death of some\n\" agent \" at a distance ; Class C, movements having apparent con\nnection with some agent already dead. Class D was reserved for\nsome anomalous cases in which no indication of any kind as to the\nsource of the movement could be discerned.\nI now proceed to give a further instalment of our evidence, in\nthe shape of a case which may provisionally be placed in Class A,\nbut which illustrates the difficulty of deciding under what conditions\nan influence from a deceased person may be deemed probable.\nIn this case there were no \" intellectual phenomena,\" nothing but\nthe apparently meaningless throwing about of pieces of wood\u2014directed,\nhowever, by some intelligence, so as to attract attention without doing\nharm. But nevertheless the witnesses of these phenomena seem\ngenerally to have interpreted them as caused by a man recently dead,\nin order to terrify a man still living into an act of honesty. That\npurpose (as they believe) was attained, and the disturbances ceased.\nIf on other grounds we considered this view plausible, the gro-\ntesqueness and vagueness of the manifestations themselves would, of\ncourse, be no objection. We cannot tell what kind of power it\nmight be possible to exert. The movements of objects which occurred\nwere of a type within the familiar experience of the supposed agent ;\nand they were effective for the end supposed to be in view. \u201e It is\nespecially noteworthy that no one person's presence seems to have been\nessential to the production of these movements.\n\f384 F. W. H. Myers.\nGroup A, Case XIV. [S. 12.]\nThe two following letters are from Mr. Bristow, now a master\njoiner, to Professor Sidgwick :\u2014\nStordale, Withington Road, Whalley Range, Manchester.\nJune 27th, 1891.\nDear Sir,\u2014I have pleasure in complying with your request to be\nfurnished with an account of certain '' Strange experiences and eerie\nphenomena \" which occurred several years ago at the village of Swanland,\nsome few miles from Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and which are\nreferred to by Mr. HebbJewhite in his letter to you. The building in which\nthe disturbances took place was of one storey, about 10ft. high, with three\nslender tie-beams placed across at intervals, and was quite open to the roof,\nits length being about 40ft., and its width 17ft. or 18ft.\nIt was a joiner's shop, in which I served an apprenticeship which had\nexpired some 12 or 15 months prior to the occurrences in question.\nThe building was quite detached, being bounded on the one side by a\ncountry road, whilst the other (in the centre of which was the doorway) faced\na grass field, beyond which stood the nearest building in that direction, some\n500 yards away. Down the centre, commencing at one end, were arranged\ntwo joiners' benches which, placed end to end, extended about half the\nlength of the shop, leaving the other half a comparatively open space ; a\ncouple of small benches only being fixed to the wall, which were at the time\nunoccupied. [See plan on p. 388.]\nOn the forenoon of the day when the disturbances commenced I could,\nfrom my position at the bench near the wall, observe every movement of my\ntwo fellow workmen in front of me, having at the same time an unobstructed\nview of the doorway and its approaches, when the man on my right\nsuddenly started up, saying, ' ' You fellows had better keep your pieces of\nwood to yourselves, and get on with your work,\" and on our asking him what\nhe meant, he replied, \"You know very well what I mean ; one of you has\npelted this piece of wood at me,\" picking up at the same time a small piece\nabout an inch or an inch and a-half square.\nThe two of us protested we had done nothing of the kind. The other\nman, I was certain, had never for a moment ceased working. Neither had I.\nThe subject, being allowed to drop, was soon forgotten, when, after the\nlapse of a very few minutes, the second man started up as suddenly as the\nfirst one had done, exclaiming, \" Now you are at me ; this piece \" (pointing\nto a rough block not larger than a match-box lying at his feet) \" has come at\nme, and there is nobody for it but you,\" meaning, of course, myself.\nThere being two to one I had to bear the blame, my emphatic denial\nnotwithstanding. I, therefore, laughingly said, \"You have each had your\npiece, it is my turn next.\" The words were scarcely out of my mouth when\na piece came sailing along and gave me a gentle dig in the ribs. \"I've got\nit at last,\" I said. \" There is something mysterious about this which puzzles\nme beyond measure. Let us have a search for the cause,\" and, acting at once\non my suggestion, we set to work and searched the nooks and corners, both\ninside and out, so carefully that even a mouse could scarcely have escaped\nus, but with no result save disappointment. The mysterious disturber of our\npeace remained undiscovered.\n\fAlleged Movement*, <kc. 385\nWe discussed the situation, getting more and more perplexed, and then\nreturned to work. I have said that three tie beams ran across the shop, and\non one of these beams, just above my head, were piled about a dozen window-\nsashes, which, by reason of their having lain there for several months, were\ncovered with dust and hung with cobwebs. I had barely resumed work when\nthose sashes began to rattle and shake as though they would fall in pieces.\nWe thought, \" Now we have something or somebody,\" and getting a small\nladder I ran up, to find the dust and cobwebs absolutely undisturbed. As I\nwas descending, and my head being on a level with one of the beams, a piece\nof wood, about the size of two fingers, and which had previously lain on the\nfloor, came dancing along, taking about two feet at a bound, on a thin board\nwhich happened to be laid on the beams, making a full stop just at my ear.\nHastening down, I said to my companions in bewilderment, \"There is some\nthing more than a trick in this. There is no one but ourselves near the place,\nneither has there been for some time. I am half inclined to think there is\nsomething of the supernatural about it, what say you ? \" One of them\nagreed with me. The other maintained it was only a clever trick being played\nupon us somehow.\nWhilst this little discussion was going on, the two men were standing\ntogether some three or four yards in front of me, the sceptical one wearing an\nold tall silk hat, when I saw a piece come from the far corner of the roof and\nknock his hat crown partly in. The expression which his suddenly-elongated\ncountenance wore at that moment was a sight not to be easily forgotten.\nHis scepticism seemed to vanish on the instant. Occasionally a piece which\nhad but a short time previously been cut off, falling to the floor, would leap\nupon the bench and come dancing along amongst the tools. I may just say\nwe were unable to catch or lay hold of any piece when in motion, every\nattempt so to do was eluded. One piece I distinctly remember taking a\nleap from the bench to a trestle about three yards away, from which it took a\nsecond one to some other object, finally settling down to rest at the end of\nthe shop. Another piece moved in a line straight as the flight of an arrow,\nabout a yard from the floor, striking noiselessly as a feather the door of a\ncloset at the end of the shop in which nails were kept. Anon, a piece would\nmove as though borne along on gently heaving waves. Again a piece would\ndash out from the most distant part of the roof, in an oblique direction, and\nquietly drop near your feat. Some three or four hours after those disturb\nances began, our foreman, an old Scotchman, named John Clark, came to\nthe shop from a new building in course of erection, a considerable distance\naway, where he and a number of other men were employed, in order to bring\nand explain to me a drawing which he had made on a board of a piece of work\nwhich he wanted me to execute. Full of the all-engrossing subject, I at\nonce said, \"John, we have some strange work going on in this shop to-day,\"\ntelling him what had taken place, at the same time hinting at its possible\nsupernatural character.\nThe old man looked at me with a serio-comic expression of countenance,\nand said, \"I should have thought you had more common-sense than to believe\nsuch nonsense for a moment. I gave you credit for knowing better, &c,\n&c.\" He had just finished his little lecture, and was proceeding to point\nout the details of the drawing on the board lying in front of us, each having a\n\f386 F. W. H. Myers.\nfinger upon it about an inch apart, when a piece with a somewhat sharp\npoint came dashing from a distant part of the roof, and struck into the\nboard betwixt our fingers. The hard-headed old Scot stood aghast, and for\nthe moment almost speechless, forbearing to make further allusion to my\ncommon-sense.\nThe foregoing is a fair specimen of what occurred during the first day,\nand this state of things was kept up with more or less frequency during\nthe following six weeks, and always in broad daylight. Occasionally we\nwould be left in comparative peace for a day or two, during which not more\nthan one or two manifestations (if I may so term them) would take place.\nWe would then have a busy season of it, as though making up for lost\ntime. On one of those latter occasions I remember a workman had come\nin from the building, and was engaged in working a French window-sill ou\nthe bench by my side, and seeing a piece about 6in. square and lin. thick rise,\nand after describing about three-fourths of a circle, say 5ft. in diameter, in\nits course strike the window-sill with considerable force just in front of\nhim. This was the largest piece I ever saw. Generally, an ordinary match-box\nwould represent their bulk, althoughof everyvarietyof shape. I preservedsome\nof those mysteriously projected missiles for a long time, one of which I\nremember was the end of a ladder stave 3in. or 4in. long. The last piece I\never saw was of oak, about lin. thick and from 2in. to 2\u00a3in. square. It\ncame in the afternoon from a distant corner of the roof towards me, and\nin its course described what might be likened to a geometrical stair or cork\nscrew of about 18in. diameter. I may here remark that in every instance,\nwithout exception, the moving pieces had been cut off work in the shop.\nNever was a piece seen to come in at the doorway.\nThe fact of pieces, in number more than I can tell, getting from the\nfloor at your feet at the one end of the shop to the farthest point of the\nroof at the other end in some mysteriously invisible fashion seemed to be\none of the strangest features of the whole thing. Never in a solitary\ninstance did any of our workmen, of whom there were sometimes six or\neight in the shop, nor any of our watchful visitors who favoured us with\ntheir company during the course of those six weeks of disturbance detect\nthe slightest indication of anything moving upward towards the roof.\nAnd yet a piece cut off and falling on the floor would, in spite of the\nlynx-eyed watchers, speedily make its way to the roof at the other end, and\ncome dashing down from a point where there had been nothing a minute\nbefore. As the time wore on we became accustomed to the thing, and the\nmovement of those blocks of wood, which seemed to be instinct with\nlife, and in some few instances almost with intelligence, caused but little\nremark. It were easy to multiply instances, but those which I have given\nbeing fair specimens of the whole may well suffice. In the foregoing plain,\nunvarnished narrative of facts there may be points upon which you may\ndesire further information, and I have only to say that I shall be pleased\nat any time to answer any questions or supply any additional information\nwhich it may be within my power to give.\nTo have any additional light thrown upon or further explanation given\nof what I deem to have been the most remarkable episode in my life\nv-iuld afford unspeakable pleasure to\u2014Dear sir, yours faithfully,\nJohn Bbistow.\n\fAlleged Movements, <L-c 387\nWithington-road, Whalley Range, Manchester, July 18th, 1891.\nDear Sir,\u2014In reply to your inquiries anent the Swanland mystery, I beg\nto say the disturbances were not dependent upon the presence of any one\nperson or number of persons. Having a somewhat extensive jobbing or\nrepairing business, workmen were frequently sent out. The three of us who\nchanced to have the shop to ourselves on the day when the disturbances com\nmenced were away several times during their continuance, and more than\nonce were all away at the same time. Not the slightest cessation was per\nceptible during our absence, the thing went on just the same. Every several\nman we had was away at one time or another during those six weeks, making\nno difference, our mysterious disturber still kept \" pegging away.\"\nThose facts were justly held to exonerate every workman about the place\nfrom all suspicion of complicity in the affair.\nI had two masters, William Habbershaw and John Gray, the latter\ndying within twelve months of the affair ; the former, with whom I lived,\nafter carrying on the business some eighteen months after his, Gray's, death,\nretired, settling down in Hull. I give the following names of eye and ear\nwitnesses who could corroborate what I have stated, but seeing it is now 30\nyears since the occurrence of the strange phenomena, very probably several\nof them are scattered; two, I know, are dead, viz., my master, John Gray,\nand Thomas Conder. Another one, James Hodsman, emigrated. Of the\nrest, with one exception, I have heard nothing since shortly after the events\nin question.\nJohn Clark, our foreman, wrote me from Hartlepool, a little over four\nyears ago, where he was then living with his son ; unfortunately, I cannot lay\nhands on his letter containing his address.\nJohn Turner, joiner, Swanland.\nThomas Smith, joiner, Welton, near Hull.\nJohn Crowther, independent gentleman, who used to make a point of\ncoming in to watch the course of events. His address : \" Swanland.\"\nJohn Harper, Swanland.\nWatson Harper, Swanland.\nI may just say that most exaggerated reports got abroad, notably in Hull,\nwhere it was said that planks 5 or 6 feet long were being hurled about.\nIt would have been easy at the time to get the written testimony of half\na score of witnesses. I have pretty copious memoranda, but apart from that\nthe whole thing lives in my memory, and is as vividly present to my mind as\nthough it were an experience of yesterday, and will, I am persuaded, so con\ntinue to the end of the mortal chapter.\u2014I am, dear sir, yours faithfully,\nJohn Brlstow.\nThe plan of the building described by Mr. Bristow, which follows,\nwas drawn by him from memory.\n\f388 F. W. H. Myers.\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 389\nThe next paper is an account of an interview which I had with\nMr. Bristow, who appeared to me a careful and trustworthy informant.\nNotes on Mr. Bristow's Case.\nManchester, July 31st, 1891.\nI have just called on Mr. Bristow, at his house in Withington-road, and\nlie has kindly supplied me with some further facts relating to the disturb\nances at Swanland. He has also presented me with his MS. notes dated\n1854. These notes seem wholly concordant with his account sent to Professor\nSidgwick. The longer account, indeed, is little more than a transcript of\nthe rough notes, with the explanations necessary to make the narrative\nintelligible to a stranger. Mr. Bristow left Swanland in 1852, but revisited\nit in 1854, and wrote his notes (as he has not the slightest doubt) after that\nvisit. I made notes of his conversation, which I now write out under several\nheads, and shall send to him for revisal, and print as revised.\n1. Position of building. On one side the long joiner's shed abutted on\nthe macadamised road of the village. There were, however, no houses very\nnear. Mr. Bristow lodged in a house about 50 yards off, which was the\nnearest on the same side. On opposite side of road was a house standing\nbehind a garden. The other sides of the shed were in a field : no house\nnearer than Swanland House, then building, about 500 yards off. No cover of\nany kind near the shed.\n2. Windows and accesses. The windows (which would not open) were low,\nso that anyone inside could easily see out of them. No one was ever detected\nat the windows, and no missile ever came in by windows or door. All the\nmissiles were pieces of wood cut off from work in the shop, sometimes\nidentifiable as bits which had dropped to the ground some ten minutes before.\n3. Independence of any special person's presence. This point was\nspecially noticed at the time, as, for want of better explanation, each new\nobserver was at first inclined to suspect some one of the other workmen.\n4. Noiselessness of fall of missiles. On some few occasions noise was\nheard ; but as a rule the missiles fell absolutely noiselessly, although with\na force which would have made loud clatter under ordinary conditions.\n5. Frequency and hours of the falls. At first there were perhaps 8 or\n10 in an hour. Later there were only two or three. The falls would begin\nat about 9 a.m. and last till 4 or 5. They always occurred by daylight.\nThe first was at about 10 a.m. from N.E. (on a Tuesday, the Hull market-\nday, when there were only three of us left in the shed) ; the last from S.W.\nat about 2 p.m.\n.\u00ab\u00a5 6. Direction from which missiles came. There seemed no special\npreference for any one direction. Sometimes they seemed to come from\nthe floor ; sometimes from near the roof. No one ever saw a missile\nactually starting on its course. It seemed as though one caught sight of\nthem at about 6 inches from their initial point.\n7. This leads on to the point that the missiles seemed to be intention\nally started when no one was looking, or expecting them. Thus the first\nthat struck me struck me half a minute or so after I had put the matter\nout of my mind. Sometimes one of us would look fixedly for many minutes\nat a bit of wood on the floor. It never moved while we looked at it. But\n\f390 F. W. H. Myers.\nonce let our attention be relaxed and that very bit of wood would come\nflying at us from some distant point. Mr. Crowther, who was a man of\nleisure and moderate independent means, used sometimes to sit in the\nshed for two or three hours at a time, watching to see a piece of wood start\non its course. He never saw one start ; though, like the rest of us, he saw\nmany which seemed to have just started. We could never make up our\nminds whether the pieces began thair flight invisibly, or only when our\nattention was diverted.\n8. Path of the missiles. Sometimes the path of the missiles would appear\nto be absolutely straight. But often it was undulatory, rotatory, or sinuous.\nSometimes it would make a series of jumps.\nThus on one occasion a piece of wood, starting from somewhere near me,\nmade a series of some three or four jumps, like a frog, along the bench, about,\nnine feet in length, at which I was sitting at work ; then sprang from the\nbench, about 3 yards, upon a trestle, only some 4 inches wide ; then front\nthe trestle on to a wheel-stool (arrangement for making a wheel), and thence\nstraight at a closet door where we kept nails, &c, where it came to rest.\nOther pieces came down through the air in corkscrew fashion.\nThe largest piece that ever fell described about three-fourths of a circle\nthus : One of us, John Turner, was working at a large French window-sill.\nHe wanted to turn it over, and raised it up, leaning against his body. I was\na few yards from him, and I saw a large piece of wood rising behind him and\nflying round him. It lodged itself in between him and the window-sill.\n9. Accuracy of aim of the missiles. I have mentioned the alighting of a-\nmissile upon the narrow trestle. Others showed a still more exact aim.\nThus when the foreman and I were poring over the drawing together, as I\nhave described, our two fingers were, I should think, hardly an inch apart p\nyet the missile fell and struck just between our fingers.\nAgain, I was once holding a chisel in my hand, and a piece of wood came1\nand sent it flying from between my fingers, without touching my fingers. In\nno case did the missiles hurt anybody. Once one flew into a pot of paint\nwhich an apprentice, Thomas Conder, was mixing ; but they did no real\nharm. For the most part they were only about as big as a matchbox\u2014you-\nmight grasp as you liked at these missiles ; there was no catching them.\n10. Impression made on witnesses. Perhaps 30 or 40 persons witnessed\nthe disturbances at different times. Not one of them could suggest any\nordinary explanation. All without exception were convinced that there was\nsome unknown cause. Most of them were more or less alarmed ; Mr.\nGray by far the most so, for a special reason.\n11. Suggested cause of the disturbances. John Gray had a brother, a.\nfarmer, who died bankrupt, and left an only son, John Gray,(the same name\nas his uncle's). This son became an apprentice to his uncle, working on\nthe bench next to me. About the termination of his apprenticeship con\nsumption laid hold on him, and he died about the age of 22 or 23 years.\nHe was hardly more than a boy, and some few weeks before the disturb\nances began rumour said that his father's creditors had not received all\nthe money (said to be \u00a3100) which ought to have been paid to them, and\nthat his uncle was responsible for this.\nMy master, Mr. Habbershaw, had been married four times, and John\n\fAlleged Movements, <ic. 391\nTurner was his stepson. I knew John Turner well ; and he told me that\nyoung John Gray's last request had been that his uncle would repay the\nmoney due to his (young John Gray's) father's creditors.\nThis, I understand, the elder John Gray did not at once do.\nI can personally vouch for his excessive terror when the disturbances\nbegan. One day especially he took me with him driving to a job on the\nestate near Tranby Croft (not built in those days), which was a couple of\nmiles or so from our workshop, and began to talk to me about the phenomena,\nas though he wished to get me to put them down to some natural cause.\nI refused to do so, and he could make no reply nor suggest any natural \u2022\ncause. His manner was that of a man almost petrified with terror. I felt\nconvinced that he had had disturbances of which we knew nothing.\nHe repaid the money\u2014as was said\u2014and the disturbances at once ceased.\nOf course I cannot vouch at first hand for the repayment of the money, but\non one point I can speak from observation. Before the disturbances\nbegan there was no tombstone to young John Gray. When they began the\nuncle put one up in North Ferriby churchyard, which I suppose is there\nnow. I cannot answer for the exact year.\n12. Witnesses now forthcoming. I much regret that I did not at the\ntime ask for signatures. I could easily have got twenty.\nJohn Gray and Thomas Conder are dead. James Hodsman emigrated.\nJohn Clarke was living 6 years ago, as I have said, but I have lost his\naddress. He lived with his son, also John Clarke, who was a draper at\nHartlepool. He might therefore possibly be traced. [Letter returned ; he\nis probably dead. \u2014F.W.H.M.]\nJohn Turner, stepson of Mr. Habbershaw, Mr. Gray's partner, is, I\nbelieve, doing business as a joiner at Swanland, and Thomas Smith at\nWelton, near Hull.\nJohn Crowther, if alive, is likely to be still in his house at Swanland.\nJohn Harper and his brother Watson Harper were labourers, but intel\nligent men. If alive, they are likely to be still at Swanland.\nNotes written out same evening. F. W. H. Myers, July 31st, 1891.\nCorrected and approved. John Bristow.\nIt was obviously important to find other surviving witnesses, who\nmight confirm or modify Mr. Bristow's account. Mrs. Sidgwick visited\nSwanland on September 29th, 1891, and her account is subjoined.\nNotes of a visit to Swanland, made within a few hours of our\ninterviews.\nSeptember 29th, 1891.\nMiss Allen and I went to Swanland this morning. Swanland is a village\ntwo miles from North Ferriby, the second station from Hull on the Hull and\nDoncaster line. We first visited the churchyard of North Ferriby, close to\nthe station, in order to discover the tombstone of John Gray. We found\ntwo tombstones which bear on our case\u2014one, to the memory of Stephen\nGray, died August, 1827, aged 27, and his wife, who died in 1842, and\nto his son, John Gray, who died, aged 22, on January 5th, 1849.\nThe other, exactly similar, was to the memory of John Gray, died 1851,\naged 48, and his wife Anne, who died 1854, aged 45.\n\f392 F. W. H. Myers.\nThe first John Gray is doubtless the nephew and the second the uncle,\nand the occurrences in question must have taken place in 1849.\nWe then went on to Swanland, and first addressed ourselves to an elderly\nblacksmith who was looking out of his shop, and said we were in search of\nJohn Turner, who, we believed, could tell us about some wonderful occur\nrences of pieces of wood flying about in the shop, &c. John Turner had\nbeen dead for some time, it appears, but our blacksmith remembered hearing\nabout the thing, and thought some of the old people could tell us about it.\nHe called an old cobbler, Edward Harper, who lived a few doors off, who\nhad not personally seen anything, but remembered the affair well, and the\nsensation it caused, people coming over from Hull to see the place. He knew\nJohn Bristow, and was interested in hearing of him, and we gathered that\nMr. Bristow had been both liked and respected in the place. Harper also\nremembered how John Crowther had interested himself in the thing, and\nafter being sceptical had become convinced of its mysterious character. But\nJohn Crowther is now dead, and Harper could not think of anyone now alive\nwho had actually seen the movements going on except \" Tommy Andrews.\"\nHarper's account of what went on was graphic, and corresponded well with\nMr. Bristow's, except that he increased the size of the pieces of wood to the\nsizo of a man's head. The belief that the disturbances arose from wishes of\nyoung John Gray's respecting money being unfulfilled by old John Gray\nwas evidently the current belief in the village at the time.\nWe then went to see Thomas Andrews\u2014an old man, rheumatic, and\nretired from work. He impressed us as a clever, sensible sort of man. He\nhas a very expressive face, and I can quite imagine his being the man \"the\nexpression of whose elongated countenance \" Mr. Bristow speaks of. Miss\nAllen remembers that Harper spoke of Andrews' hat being knocked in by one\nof the pieces of wood, but we neglected to ask him about this, nor did I in\nquire of him about specific phenomena mentioned by Mr. Bristow, but rather\ntried to draw out his own independent account of things. He told us that\nthe pieces of wood certainly did fly about for the space of five or six weeks,\nthat he was working in the shop at the time and believed he was one of the\nfirst to see them, that he believed it to be a trick at first. I asked whether\nhe was sure it was not a trick, and he said he was sure, because they\nsearched, and no one could have played it, and because the pieces of wood\ncould not have taken the course they did had they been thrown. To illustrate\nthis he made us hold his stick and showed how a piece Would come along and\ngo round the stick as it were, and \"no one could throw it like that.\" Asked\nas to explanations, said that some gave one and some another\u2014but the only\none we got out of him was the one about John Gray junior's unfulfilled\nwishes and the tombstone, which he said was afterwards put up. This was\nhis own belief as to the explanation, but he said that John Gray, senior,\nwhen asked about it, shuffled the matter. The only specific incident I re\nmember his mentioning was about the Scotch foreman and the piece that came\ndown as he was looking at the plan. Mr. Andrews afterwards himself took\nthe business and occupied the shed for a time\u2014was often in it at night, &Ci\u2014\nbut never saw anything mysterious except during those six weeks. I think\nhe corroborated the fact that the phenomena happened independently of any\none person's presence\u2014but am not sure. He was a little deaf, and it was\n\fAlleged Movements, &c. 393\nnot quite easy to make him understand our questions. We asked when it\nhappened, and he calculated back that it must have been between 40 and 50\nyears back. He too was keen to hear about John Bristow, whom he\nremembered well\u2014-said he was an apprentice in the shop at the time,\nMr. Andrews also knew about Mr. Crowther's investigating.\nWe saw the shed. As you come into Swanland from Ferriby it is a few\ndoors to the left on the left-hand side of the road, and is still used as a car\npenter's shop. It corresponds to Mr. Bristow's general description of it, except\nthat it now has a door on to the village street, a door in two divisions, the\nupper one of which was opened by a man who looked out as we came up to it.\nWe spoke to him, but he knew nothing .of the matter ; he was young and a\nnew-comer. We looked in through the open half of the door, and saw that\nthe interior of the shed and the general surroundings corresponded as far as\nwe saw to Mr. Bristow's plan, but we did not go into the yard.\nMr. Andrews' account of the size of the pieces of wood made them some\nwhat larger than Mr. Bristow's\u2014about 4 inches square.\nAltogether, all we saw and heard went to confirm Mr. Bristow's account,\nexcept that the tombstone, which Mr. Andrews also said had been put up to\nJohn Gray junior after the disturbances, was really put up to his father and\nmother as well, and we cannot say whether John Gray senior really erected\nit to the whole family then, or whether he added the name of the young man\nthen, which led to the rumour.\nWe are not sure whether John Crowther has left any family in Swan-\nland, but doubt whether, if he did, it would be worth asking them for\nnotes, as, from the way he was spoken of, it hardly seemed to us likely that\nhe had taken any.\nEleanor Mildred Siduwick.\nEleanor Wardell Allen.\nP.S.\u2014October 1st.\u2014I have just been looking through Mr. Bristow's rough\nnotes, and see that Thomas Andrews was the man who, according to him,\nhad his hat knocked in. Miss Allen did not know this, so that the fact\nof Edward Harper, according to her recollection, remembering that Andrews\nwas said to have had his hat knocked in must be regarded as confirmation\nof Mr. Bristow's account. It is also in Mr. Bristow's favour that a witness\nhe did not refer us to\u2014T. Andrews\u2014should confirm him as he did.\nE. M. S.\n[The rough notes of 1854 begin with the words : ' ' On Tuesday forenoon\nTom Smith, Tom Andrews, and myself were working in the shop\" ; and later\non says : \" I noticed a piece come from the farthest corner of the roof, and\npartially knock in the crown of Andrews' tall hat.\"\u2014P. W. H. M.]\nThese various recollections, independently obtained, and the\nobservation of the still-standing shed and its surroundings, confirm\nthe accuracy of Mr. Bristow's memory in a somewhat unusual way,\nconsidering that more than 42 years had elapsed between the events\nand the complete collection of evidence. We may, I think, be pretty\nsure that the paper of 1854 contains a substantially accurate account\nof the events of 1849.\n2 D\n\f394 F. W. H. Myers,\nIt is, I think, hard to doubt that in that year a long series of inex\nplicable movements of objects took place ; that these movements\noccurred in full daylight, and in the midst of a number of adult York-\nshiremen at work on their ordinary occupations ; and that no observer\nwas able to suggest any explanation except the agency of a deceased\ncomrade. It cannot now be proved in the same first-hand manner\nthat on the execution of this deceased comrade's dying wish, the mani\nfestations ceased.\nThe apparent connection with this departed person may possibly be\na mere coincidence. But in any case the movements themselves will\nremain to be explained ; and no plausible explanation by ordinary laws\nhas as yet, I think, been suggested.\nFurther discussion must be left for a subsequent paper. In the\nmeantime it is to be hoped that each fresh instalment of testimony of\nthis perplexing type may prompt to a wider collection of similar\nrecords. Considering how very little serious effort has as yet been\nmade in this direction, the amount of evidence which has already come\nto hand is enough to suggest that a good many sporadic phenomena may\nbe taking place in this world of which science hears little, and might\nwith advantage hear more.\n\fsupplement) \" Riddles of the Sphinx.\" 395\nSUPPLEMENT.\ni.\n\" RIDDLES OF THE SPHINX.\" i\nThere is an operation in Joint Stock Company finance known as the\nReduction of Capital. When a dividend cannot be paid on the amount\noriginally subscribed, and embarrassing liabilities are threatened, solvency\nis restored by bringing down the nominal value of the investment to a\nremunerative point. The concern is saved from liquidation by a necessary\nsacrifice. And perhaps the verdict of philosophy on this remarkable\nbook may be analogous in effect. A high speculative value may be\nconceded to it, on condition that its pretensions to be a solution of\n\"ultimate\" problems are abated. For what may be called the work\ning conceptions of the author are not really inconsistent with the\ncontinued suspense of metaphysical problems, which find here a treatment\nmore original and heroic than easily acceptable. The author's primary\npostulate \u2014an original plurality of existences\u2014may retain its validity for a\nmetaphysical conception of the world and the world-process, even if it is\npronounced more than problematical from the standpoint of absolute\nontology. For even in a metaphysical exposition, we may disembarrass our\nselves of metaphysics with which the aim of the exposition is not co-extensive.\nNow, the advantage of conceiving the world\u2014as our author conceives it\u2014from\nthe standpoint of Evolutionism is that it presents to Reason a problem limited\nand defined. And the possibility of this limitation of the problem lies in such\na definition of \"the world \" as shall not include \" existence in general,\" and\nto which, therefore, any questions Reason may ask concerning existence in\ngeneral are irrelevant. But to attempt to make absolute and final for Reason\nthe data obtained from the standpoint of Evolutionism must inevitably raise\nthe very question which was ostensibly disclaimed. The Pluralism of the\nauthor is therefore, ex hypothesi, a historical starting-point, however\nidealistically conceived, and accordingly we cannot concede to it the\ncharacter of a genuine or final ontology.\nWith this important limitation, we may acknowledge that the skill with\n1 Riddles of the Sphinx. A Study in the Philosophy of Evolution. By \"A\nTroglodyte.\" London : Swan Sonuenachein and Co., 1891.\n2 d 2\n\f396 [Supplement\nC. G. Massey.\nwhich we are prepared for the statement of the. author's problem, the\nstatement itself, and the solution, exhibit philosophical power of\na high order. In the chapter on \"The Metaphysics of Evolution,\"\nwe are led to see the necessity of teleology, and what teleology\nimports. The merely scientific application of the Historical Method\nfails wholly as an explanation of the higher, more complete and\ncomplex result which it traces to its lower and simpler beginning in the\norder of time. \" Unmetaphysical \" Evolutionism is in fact \"pseudo-meta\nphysical,\" for it is driven to insert in its original datum the germ or poten\ntiality of all into which it develops. 1 But when we come to close quarters\nwith this potentiality, and ask what it means, we find that we have, with\nAristotle, to conceive it as the metaphysical actuality of the potential.\n\" And that actuality must be not only prior (in Time, if the process is con\nceived as one in Time, or only in idea, or in both), but, by the very terms of the\nhypothesis, external to the evolving world, non-material and non-phenomenal.\nFor since the whole of the material and the phenomenal was supposed to\nhave been derived out of the pure potentiality, the reality presupposed by that\npotentiality cannot itself have formed part of the material and phenomenal\nworld. And thus, so far from dispensing with the need of a Divine First Cause,\nthe theory of Evolution, if only we have the faith in science to carry it to its\nconclusion, and the courage to interpret it, proves irrefragably that no evolu\ntion was possible without a pre-existent Deity, and a Deity, moreover, trans\ncendent, non-material, and non-phenomenal. And for the power of such a-\nDeity to produce the world, the pure potentiality with which evolution starts is\nmerely the expression. And the world as actual is prior to the germ which\npotentially contains it, simply because the world-process is the working out of\nan anterior purpose or idea in the divine consciousness. And as all things are,\nas far as possible, directed to the realisation of that end or purpose, the.\nreal nature of things is to be found in their final course, and not in their his\ntorical antecedents, which, just because they take precedence in Time, are\nmeans to an end, and of inferior significance in truth.\" (Pp. 198-9.)\n\" What comes first in science comes last in metaphysics. It is in the\nhigher and subsequent that the explanation of the lower and anterior is to be\nsought. And instead of being simpler and more susceptible of explanation, the\nlower stages of the process are really the obscurer and more unintelligible,\nbecause they do not so clearly exhibit the drift of the process. Hence their\nexplanation comes last, just because in the historical process they came first.\nWe must not therefore hastily conclude that because the teleological method is\ntrue, it will be at once possible to give a teleological explanation of the physical\nlaws of nature. The physical laws of nature are the earliest and lowest laws of\nthe world-process, the first attempts at the realisation of its End, and so are the\nvery last to become intelligible. If we ever arrive at a teleological explanation\nof them, it will be only after we have worked doton to them from the higher\nlaws of the more complex phenomena.

In\nfact the process, as here conceived, might be described as Dens naturans (as\nits completion is Dens naturatus), were it not that the moments of \" becom\ning \" are not purely representative of the action of the supreme Agent, but\nresult from the interaction of two factors,\u2014God and the individual spirits or\nEgos\u2014as agent and re-agents, and thus nature is the product of a re-action.\n\" The cosmos of our experience is a stress or interaction between God and\nourselves.\"\nBut before arrival at this point, the \"atomic\" constitution of the world\nhad been considered by the author as possibly antecedent to consciousness.\nThe atom is a centre of Force, and is provisionally defined as \" a constant\nmanifestation of Divine Force or Will, exercised at a definite point.\" For\n\"Matter \" is found to be \"a metaphysical fiction designed to provide forces\nwith a vehicle\" (p. 272). \" There is no need to suppose that an unknowable\n1 Matter ' is an ultimate reality, merely because phenomenal things have\nthe attribute of materiality. Matter is not the only conceivable substratum of\nForce.\" The true substratum of Force is discoverable in what we know\n\u2014intelligence\u2014and the Force-atoms, or centres, are modes of what we also\nknow, viz., Will. \" Historically it is undeniable that Force is depersonalised\nWill, that the prototype of Force is Will, which even now is the Force par\nexcellence, and the only one we know directly\" 1 (p. 274). Thus \" our ' force-\natoms' will have developed into ' monads, ' spiritual entities akin to ourselves. ''\n\"It is this closer reference to our own consciousness which makes Force a\nmore satisfactory explanation of things than Matter ; it is nearer to the\nhigher, and therefore more capable of really explaining than the lower.\"\n'' To use causation without a reference to our own wills is to use a category\nwhich has been reduced to a mere word without meaning.\" \" The unity of\nphilosophy and of the universe is vindicated by the discovery of the funda\nmental identity of Matter and Spirit, and the ultimate reduction of the\nformer to the latter.\" But then the difficulty arises of determining \" the\nnature of the intelligence which Matter is divined to conceal, and to discover\nwhat is the function of this disguise of Spirit\"\u2014in other words, \" the\nnature of the intelligence of the force-atoms.\" Foregoing the assistance he\nmight receive from Mr. Crookes's theory of the individualism of atoms\u2014of\n\u00bb which an account was given in Chapter vii.\u2014till that theory has received fuller\nconfirmation, the author recognises the limitation of consciousness to living\nbeings \"out of which it is historically probable that our highly-evolved con\nsciousness has developed.\"\nSpace is regarded as subjective, an idea obtained by abstraction : Time,\non the other hand, is held to be real in a relative sense, and finite.\n\" The reality of Time is involved in the reality of the world-process,\"\nand \"the subjectivity of Time would destroy the whole meaning and\nreality of the world-process, and negate the idea of the world as an\n1 This conception was expounded many years ago by Dr. James Martineau, in his\n?ssay on \"Materialism\" (Cont.

And with like reason we can conceive an end of time in a con\nsciousness not representative of change. Such is the author's conception of\nthe consummation of the world-process by complete development of the mun\ndane factor\u2014the Egos\u2014in perfect adaptation to the Divine Will and the\nIdeal world. This result would be analogous to the hypothetical \"motion\nin a perfect fluid,\" which is equivalent to rest, all transition being instan\ntaneous in the absence of retardation.\nThe world-process being thus conceived as \"a gradual harmonising of\nthe Deity and the Ego,\" and as denoting \"increase in the intercourse and\ninteraction between them,\" the author's theory of the Ego and of its realisa\ntion in personal development now claims attention.\nThe pre-cosmic \"atom\" represents limitation of consciousness to the\nzero point, or as near thereto as the conception of phenomenality will\npermit. But as an \"ultimate reality\" the individual factor cannot be\nresolved into this phenomenon. Thus the true \" Ego \"is \" transcendental, \"\nthe constant \"I \" \"with all its powers and latent capacities of development \"\nwhich is the identical substratum of all the changes of conscious personality.\nIt is thus identifiable essentially with the smaller \"self \"of consciousness,\nwhich represents it inadequately, but by progressive approximation, from the\nprimary interaction with Deity, which is manifest phenomenally in the atom,\nto the glorified consciousness of perpetual and associated mankind, in\nadaptation to the Divine Idea, at the final consummation of the process.\nThe limitation of our problem to the cosmos and its time-process forbids, of\ncourse, any question as to the pre-cosmic state of the Egos. The author\nseems to hold that for the realisation of the Divine design it was\nnecessary that the Egos, with their great powers of resistance and\ninterference, should be reduced to complete torpor, for the initiation of\nthe process of their adaptation, and this torpor is represented by the\nphenomenal condition of inorganic materiality. A sort of \"statuvolence\"\nis thus induced, and the analogy of Hypnotism is found applicable to\nthe different stages of the process. For \"it is far easier for the operator to\nput his hypnotised subject asleep than to produce the higher manifestations\nin which the consciousness of the subject is called forth, but guided by the\nwill of the operator, and these require far more elaborate and delicate\npreparations. On this analogy, then, we may say that the lower animals are\nstill entranced in the lower stage of brute lethargy, while we have passed into\nthe higher phase of somnambulism,which already permits us strange glimpses\nof a lucidity that divines the realities of the transcendental world \" (p. 294).\nAnd there is yet another use of this analogy. It is not apparent a pi'iort\nhow the interaction between the Deity and the Egos should result in an.\nobjectivity of the world common to all the \" percipients.\" Why should the\nreaction be modally identical in each and all of the latter ? Why is there\nnot for each a \" subjective cosmos \" ? In the similar case of the different\ndreams which might be excited in different persons by the same waking\n\fSupplement ] 399\n\"Riddles of the Sphinx.\"\nexperience, each dream would indeed be a symbol of the same real occasion,\nand so far dreams illustrate the relation of the phenomenal world to its\ncausal reality. But parallel or corresponding dreams or hallucinations of\ndifferent people have been rarely recorded\u2014the cases in Phantasms of the\nLiving are referred to\u2014and the author prefers the analogy of the collective\nhallucinations which can be induced in several hypnotised subjects, of which\ninstances have been published in these Proceedings. And it seems quite\nsupposable, on the hypothesis we are considering, that uniformity of presen\ntation would be easily secured at the most depressed stage of psychical\nindividuality, with subjective difference at its minimum. The persistence of\nuniformity in later stages of the process may be regarded as a natural\nsurvival of established solidarity, cosmical community beginning at the base\nof experience, and subsequent differentiation being concerned with a con\nsciousness superior to the physical, finding its own eventual tendency to social\nharmony and correspondence in evolutionary conformity to the Divine\nplan.\nBut that we may not be misled by the author's analogy, one difference\nmust be noted, that whereas the hypnotiser seeks only automatic conformity\nto his will, the purpose of the Deity requires a true voluntary conformity or\nadaptation, and thus depression of independent functions is only preparatory\nto their re-establishment with radically new dispositions. The whole process\nof Evolution is shown to be conducive to this result. \"If we think out the\nrelation which on our theory must exist between the Deity and the Egos, we\nshall perceive that matter is an admirably calculated machine for regulating,\nlimiting, and restraining the consciousness which it encases \" (p. 293). The\nreinterpretation of the facts on which Materialism relies is as apparent on the\nauthor's theory as it is admirably expounded, and leads us to the conclusion\nthat \"Matter is not that which produces consciousness, but that which limits\nit and confines its intensity within certain limits ; material organisation\ndoes not construct consciousness out of arrangements of atoms, but con\ntracts its manifestation within the sphere which it permits \" (p. 295).\nThus the body is to be regarded, not only as the organ of consciousness, but\nas \"a mechanism for inhibiting consciousness, for preventing the full powers\nof the Ego from being prematurely actualised.\" But advance in organisation\nliberates consciousness by making unnecessary its preoccupation with the\nlower functions of life, and marks an increase of intercourse and interaction\nbetween God and the Egos. Every positive attainment by consciousness is\nthe relatively unconscious of a subsequent stage, and thus heredity, as develop\nment of aptitudes, sets consciousness free for the pursuit of the higher\nresults which are the responses of new susceptibility to Divine influence.\n\"The essential meaning, then, of material organisation in the evolution of\nthe individual is mechanism, and structure is essentially a labour-saving\napparatus which sets free consciousness. And this estimate of the function\nof matter and the meaning of complexity of organisation in the individual is\nconfirmed by its applicability to the organisation of society. For both the\ncomplex structure of higher societies and their elaborate material machinery\nare essentially contrivances for liberating force, and enabling them to pro\nduce a higher intelligence, which shall be competent to deal with higher\nproblems \" (p. 293).\n\f400 [.Supplement.\nC. C.Maaaey.\nThe author justly claims for his system the merit of substituting\nconcrete realities for abstractions in its formula for the world-process.\n'' For while all the terms of the other definitions of Evolutions, ' hetero\ngeneity,' 'motion,' 'matter,' ' consciousness,' &c, are abstractions which stand\nfor qualities of reality, which could never exist by themselves, terms like\n' indiv'dual,' ' person,' and 'society' designate realities. Atoms (?), crystals,\nanimals, and men, the successive embodiments of the process towards\nindividuality, are all of them real, and as such possess an infinity of attri\nbutes \" (p. 239).\nAnd in the theory of the Transcendental Ego, of the reduction of its\npowers to latency, and of its gradual regeneration by the development of a\nconscious self that shall eventually be its fully adequate representative, and\ndivinely actuated realisation, we are prepared for the statement that the\nindividuality of our present phenomenal self is still inchoate. And this\nintroduces us to considerations of especial interest for Psychical Research,\nand avowedly due to the influence of that study. We all, as a matter of\ncourse, make acknowledgment of the moral and intellectual imperfection\nof mankind, without having in the least understood the psychological\nsignificance of the admission. The true defect of the individual is non-\nattainment of individuality. The Transcendental Ego is, so to speak, a\nSchema of perfection, an ideal for consciousness to fulfil. The new school of\npsychology, which studies the phenomena of human abnormality, with a\nview to the better interpretation of man, has suggested, but not quite\nexplicitly anticipated, this inference from its facts. Mr. F. W. H. Myers,\nindeed, in passages quoted by the author, has come very near to a statement\nof it. But generally the phenomena in question\u2014\"multiplex personality\"\nand stfme cognate facts\u2014have been treated rather as derogating from this\nestablished unity of the person, than as indicative of an imperfect evolution\nof personality. We may note three stages in the treatment of these\nphenomena. First, there was the pathological stage, in which pre\nsuppositions of morbidity actually (as there can now be little doubt) inter\nfered with due scientific observation of the facts themselves, preventing\nrecognition of such as could not be accommodated to the medical hypothesis,\nand of which the mere statement would discredit the observer in public or\nin professional estimation. This stage is now being hopefully replaced by\nthat of scientific verification. But \" facts \" do not lead directly to ideas ;\nor rather we do not arrive at facts in any systematic order unless observation\nis guided by conceptions. If the latter belong to principles already recog\nnised in science, we may have an extension of knowledge on the surface but\nno deepening of its foundations. And should the facts be referable to a\nstratum of nature below the surface already won, \"science\" alone is helpless\nto deal with them ; they are only explicable in the light of a philosophy\nwhich they cannot, in themselves, be adequate to prove.\nBut to judge of the relevance of the author's theory to the problem in\nquestion, it is proper that we should hear himself on the point :\u2014\n\" The phenomenal self,\" he says, \" is that portion of the Transcendental Ego\nwhich is at any time actual (exists evepyda) or present in consciousness, and\nforms but a feeble and partial excerpt of the Ego. But the Self is as yet alone\nreal, and as in the progress of its development it unfolds all its hidden powers,\nit approximates more and more to the Ego, until at last the actual and the\n\fSupplement.] 401\n\" Riddies of the Sphinx.\"\npotential would\" become co-extensive, the Self and the Ego would coincide, and\nin the attainment of perfection we should be all we are capable of being. And\nthis account of the relation of the Ego to the Self is not only metaphysically\nnecessary, but supported also by the direct scientific evidence of experimen\ntal psychology. For it seems to provide an explanation of the exceedingly\nperplexing phenomena of double or multifold and alternating consciousness,\nmultiplex personality, and ' secondary ' selves. These curious phenomena\nforcibly bring home to us what a partial and imperfect thing our ordinary\nconsciousness is, how much goes on within us of which we know Dothing,\nhow far the phenomenal falls short of being co-extensive with our whole\nnature. And yet we must either include these changes of personality within\nthe limits of our own 'self,' or ascribe them to possession by 'spirits.' And\nthere can be little doubt that the foimer theory is in most cases obviously\npreferable. The secondary selves show such close relations to the primary,\ndisplay such complications of inclusive and exclusive memories, betray such\nconstant tendencies to merge into or to absorb their primaries, that we cannot\nexclude them from our 'selves.' Indeed, it is often difficult to decide which of\nseveral personalities is to be regarded as the primary self. . . . By the\ntheory suggested all these difficulties may be solved. They merely illustrate\nthe contention that our ordinary selves are neither our whole selves nor our\ntrue selves. They are, as Mr. Myers phrases it, merely that portion of the self\nwhich has happened to come to the surface, or which it has paid to develop into\nactual consciousness in the course of Evolution. They are our habitual and\nnormal selves, more or less on a par with the secondary selves, and, like them,\nphenomenal. But the Ego includes them all, and this inclusion justifies us in\nreckoning these phenomena part of ourselves. In it the phenomenal selves unite\nand combine, and as a beginning of this fusion it is interesting to find traces of\ncoalescence in the higher stages of personalities which at lower stages had\nseemed exclusive and antagonistic\" (p. 281, et seq.).\nThe author had already called attention to the fact that in some\nlower forms of life we see this imperfect co-ordination expressed physically,\nin the multiplication of complete physical individuals by mere fission.\nAnd it is perhaps an evidence of life at a similar stage in the psychical\norder, when we find repeated in that order an apparently analogous\nphenomenon. The significance of the contemporaneous development of such\ndifferences of character, within a common subjectivity, as are apparent in\nsome of our cases, will be adverted to later on. But the whole conception of\nthe gradual realisation in consciousness of a schema of individuality, such as\nis the \" Transcendental Ego \" in original potentiality, seems to necessitate\nthe idea of successive storages of distinct experiences converted into special\nfaculty and characteristic tendencies. We are not, however, on this account\nobliged to attribute to the partially realised Transcendental Ego a transcen\ndental consciousness overlooking, as it were, the consciousness of its pheno\nmenal moment, and distinct therefrom. For just as the greater part of the\nphenomenal self or character is in latency or abeyance in the pre-occupation\nof any special moment of its experience, so the case may be similar with the\nTranscendental Ego, which may invest the whole of its consciousness in its\npresent constructions through the phenomenal life in progress. But as in\nour own experience, as phenomenal persons, there sometimes intrudes a\nphase of our interest or character irrelevant to, and interruptive of, the\nbusiness in hand, so may occasionally be broken that concentration or pre\n\f402 [Supplement.\nft ft Massey.\noccupation of the more collective personality of the Transcendental Ego\nwhich is indispensable to the continuity of our phenomenal life.\nHowever that may be, the author is clear \"that the Ego is not a second,\nor alien consciousness concurrent with and distinct from the selves. The\nself or selves are simply the actually conscious part of the Ego, which\nrepresents the potentialities of their development on the one hand and\ntheir primary and pre-cosmic condition on the other. The Ego is both the\nbasis of the development and its end, but within the process the selves\nalone are real\" (p. 410). It is, however, left problematical whether, \"in\nthe intervals, as it were, of its incarnations,\" the Ego recovers a conscious\nness and memory of its past lives ; but in that case \"these lucid intervals,\nthough they might produce great moral effects, would not in themselves\nform part of the phenomenal development, and the latter would appear to\nbe continuous from phase to phase of phenomenal consciousness. \"\nIn the possibility of a successive multitude of objective lives, develop\ning distinct characteristics within the integrity of a true individuality, we\nhave already, it would seem, the potentiality, the ideal, and the type of a\nsocial integration. A transcendental individuality capable of and needing\nexpression in a long succession of distinctly characterised phenomenal lives\nis itself a social microcosm of at least a family type. We see what we call\ndifferent \"sides \" or \"aspects\" of individual characters on earth, and they\nare sometimes so independent of a central control as to disturb the uni\nformity of a career, making it a manifestation of different and even opposed\ntendencies. The individual is then described as \"eccentric,\" as if eccen\ntricity were itself a characteristic, instead of being the negation of consis\ntent character, and an evidence of immature personality. By the light of\nthe hypothesis we are considering, we may, perhaps, see in it what would\nnormally require a duality of incarnations comprised in one. And it will\nno longer be surprising if, occasionally, the duality should be subliminal\nand only emerge under abnormal conditions. Such disturbances of the\nphenomenal personality may be purposive, but they are more easily conceiv\nable as testifying to an imperfect co-ordination and assimilation of the ingene-\nrated experiences of the transcendental individuality. But in any case we\ncannot place the latter quite outside the process, considered comprehensively,\nfor it has evidently a function in the process analogous to the organic. The\ndevelopment of the Ego as a realised individual requires the perfect asso\nciation or integration of all the potential elements which have been brought\nto consciousness through phenomenal conditions. The possibility of the\nultimate social solidarity, which is the consummation of the world-process,\ndepends on the perfect accomplishment of the social process in the in\ndividual. Only as a true microcosm is it an eventual element in the macro\ncosm. For this internal development educes the affinities which make\nexternal combination possible. Both processes are alternately necessary,\nand perhaps we may compare the phenomenal life to the activity of a day\ntime, and the subjective interval to the sleep in which digestion and.\nassimilation prepare the organism for a renewal of voluntary functions.\nIf these speculations should be thought too remote from verification, it\nshould at least be remembered that we are driven to speculation by the\ncourse of scientific inquiry ; . and that, as the author remarks (p. 237),\n\fSupplement.] \" Riddles of the Sphinx.\" 403\n\" there are many facts about our constitution which it is difficult to explain\nexcept on the theory that from a higher point of view our individuality would\nappear almost as shadowy and imperfect as that of a zoophyte does to us.\"\nAnd the more probable this appears, the less probable is it that an eschato-\nlogy can be independent of philosophy, or that we shall be able to settle the\nquestion of \"a future life\" by mere appeal to empirical facts. Even the\nbest evidence of this sort\u2014and the author describes the evidence as \"prob\nably the vastest body of unsystematised testimony in the world, varying\nin value from the merest hearsay to the carefully recorded experience of the\nablest and most competent men \"\u2014carries us a very little way, and its\ncharacter is often such as to provoke new doubts and raise new difficulties.\nShould we not expect this to be the case if our phenomenal life is only a\ntransient moment of an individuality which it only partially, perhaps even\nonly minutely, represents ? On the other hand, what is positive in the\nevidence seems to be just what we should also expect on that very supposi\ntion. For then ghostly and spiritistic manifestations would be mere\nmemorial survivals, and this is just what, when the evidence of identity is\nat its best, they are. \"Alas, poor ghost ! \" Poor remnant of an experience\nfrom which all the use and vitality has been extracted. Perhaps, after all,\nthe general indifference of mankind to the question of the future life, which\nthe author censures and deplores, may be realty a confirmation of his own\ntheory of immortality. For if that is true, the future life of the phenomenal\nperson, in the distinct and unambiguous sense of the continuity of a realised\nconsciousness, is at most conditional. The life we know is a special concentra\ntion, a contraction of the sphere of the Ego. With the withdrawal of the\nconditions of its experience and habitual activity, all that is significant and\nconcrete in the conception of identity would seem to be lost. If the truth\nof our immortality is the absorption of the phenomenal in the transcendental\nperson, to the great majority of mankind this would be hardly a degree\nless indifferent and insignificant than absorption in Pan. Immersed in\nobjective interests, consciousness [has not developed the modes of its sub\njective survival, nor forged the links of a realised identity with our eternal\nprinciple. If, then, the true immortality is a return to the subjective and\ntranscendental, it is at least a wise instinct that prevents men from seeking it\nwhere alone they could seek it with interest and concern, in a false con\ntinuity of external manifestation. And yet in such manifestations, studied\nwithout prejudice and without misplaced hope, we may find proof enough to\nconfute the grosser sort of materialism, and suggestion enough to guide\npsychical research to results that shall be more than speculative.\nIn the chapter on \"Immortality,\" the necessary distinction is made\nbetween the identity of the Transcendental Ego in all its upward manifesta\ntions from the lowest form of life to the life of man, and the self-identifica\ntion which depends on memory. For the latter we thus arrive at a\n\"graduated \" immortality :\u2014\n\"If we can conceive a future life, the reality of which depends on memory,\nit will admit of less or more. And if, as seems natural, the extent to which\nthe events of life are remembered depends largely on the intensity of spiritual\nactivity they implied, it follows that the higher and intenser consciousness was\nduring life, the greater the intensity of future consciousness. Hence the amoeba\n\f404 [Supplement.\nC. G. Massey.\nor the embryo, with their infinitesimal consciousness, will possess only an infini\ntesimal memory of their past after death. And this for a twofold reason : not\nonly must the impress life produces upon so rudimentary a consciousness generate\nonly a very faint memory, but the contents also of life will present little that is\ncapable of persisting and worthy of being retained. Thus the lowest phase of\nspiritual existence will have nothing to remember, and hardly any neans of\nremembering it. We cannot, therefore, ascribe to them any vivid or enduring-\nconsciousness of their past lives, and yet need not deny it altogether. They\nhave a future life, but it is rudimentary.\" \" By a self-acting arrangement the\ncondition of consciousness hereafter will accurately correspond to its attain\nments here. Just in proportion as we have developed our spiritual powers here\nwill be our spiritual future. Those who have lived the life of beasts here, a dull\nand brutish life that was redeemed by no effort to illumine the soul by spiritual\nenlightenment, will be rewarded as ' the beasts that perish.' They will retain\nlittle of what they were, their future life will be brief and faint. On the other\nhand, we need not hesitate to attribute to the faithful dog, whom the strength\nof pure affection for his master has lifted far above the spiritual level of his race,\nat least as much immortality as the brutal savage, whose life has been ennobled\nby no high thoughts and redeemed by no elevated feeling\u2014' Nicht nur Verdienst,\naudi Treue wahrt uns die Person.' Those, again, whose activities have been\ndevoted to the commission of evil deeds, that burn their impress on the soul,\nwill be haunted by their torturing memory. Those who have habituated them\nselves to high and noble activities, who have disposed their thoughts towards\ntruths which are permanent, and their affections towards relations which are\nenduring, will rise to life everlasting. . . . Thus each of us will be the\nmaster and maker of his own self and of his own immortality, and his future life\nwill be such as he has deserved.\"\nThat, however, is memorial survival ; but the true, metaphysical,\nimmortality is unconditional. That is to say,\n\"To the extent to which we are to be identified with ultimate existences\nand Transcendental Egos, it is absolutely certain that we are immortal.\nAnd, further, as the whole world-process is a process taking place in the\ninteraction between the Egos and the Deity, the different stages of material\nevolution must correspond to different phases of that spiritual interaction.\nParallel, therefore, to the physical evolution, there runs a spiritual evolution,\nrelated to it as meaning and motive to outward and visible manifesta\ntion. And there is no reason why this process should not be the develop\nment, not of Spirit in general, but of particular spirits, why a single Ego\nshould not pass through the succession of organisms and developments of con\nsciousness, from the amceba to man, and from man to perfection. This gives,\nas it were, the spiritual interpretation of the descent of man from the beasts, and\nat the same time assures him of his due and proportionate share in the immor\ntality of the ultimate spirit.\"\nThe answer to the question: \" What is the relation of such an eternal\nspirit to its successive phases, which form our phenomenal existences, and\nin what sense can these be said to have a future life ? \" is thus already\nevident. \" They persist as factors in the development. \" \"All the elements\nof the lower phases of life that are capable of development are transformed\ninto the higher,\" the rest being rejected in accordance with \" the law\nwhereby all organisms take up and assimilate what they can utilise, i.e.,\nwhat serves their purposes, and reject what they cannot.\"\n\fSupplement.] 405\n\" Riddles of the Sphinx.\"\n\"Nevertheless it is not until the higher stages of individuality and spiritual\ndevelopment are reached that the phenomenal self of any single life, i.e., the\nmemory of its past, can he supposed to form a predominant, or even an im\nportant, factor in the total or final consciousness of the Ego, or one that can\ndisplay any great permanence. The lower phases of Evolution do not\ngenerate sufficient psychical energy to attain to any considerahle degree of\nimmortality. \"\nOn mere \"memory,\" however, we should not lay too much stress. For\nas, on the one hand, \" it is not necessary that we should remember all we\ndid ten years ago in order to feel ourselves the same persons now as then,\"\nso, on the other hand, the result of experience is much more than memory ;\nit is the development of faculty and intelligence. And that is at once the\ninterest of the Transcendental Ego in the phenomenal life, and also the true\npreservation of whatever in the latter is fitted to survive.\nThe difficulty supposed to be offered by Heredity to the conception of\nPre-existence is met by the author alternatively in two ways. For, first, it\nmay be said that heredity, while offering the conditions of individual mani\nfestation, cannot show the selective determination which results in the actual\nindividual character.\n\" The parents possess an indefinite number of potentialities that may\npossibly be inherited, and these, again, may be commingled in an indefinite\nnumber of ways. But the character actually inherited is a definite combina\ntion of these potential qualities, and what determines the way in which it\nis actually combined? It is not enough to know generally that the parents\nsupply the materials of the new combination ; we must know also what arranges\nthe materials in a defmite order. Now if we supposed that this proportion in\nwhich the various dispositions of the parents entered into the character of\nthe offspring was really determined by the character of the spiritual entity\nwhich the parents were capable of providing with a suitable organism,' we\nshould at all events have devised a method which rendered pre-existence com\npatible with heredity. For there is no apparent break in the chain of natural\ncauses : the whole character of the offspring is inherited from the parents. But\nas the limits within which heredity is possible are very wide, the spiritual selec\ntion is supposed to work within them.\"\nOr, secondly, we may have immediate recourse to teleology, allowing\nthat the character of the offspring is definitely determined at birth, but\ninsisting that it is just so determined in the interest of the true individuality\nwhich has to be developed.\n\"As the ultimate explanation of everything is teleogical, i.e., relative to\nthe end of the world-process, the parents must be in the last resort held to\ntransmit certain qualities to their offspring in order to further the develop\nment of the pre-existing spirits. For .the parents are such as they are, their\nparents are such as they are, and so on, everything is such as it is, until the\nmetaphysical or first cause of the world-process is reached, which is also its\nfinal cause, and acts in a certain way in order to promote that process.\"\nThe identification of the Transcendental Ego with the lower phenomenal\nstages of the process, perhaps even with man, is relieved from obvious\ndifficulty by a supposition which has both presumption and evidence in its\nfavour. The Ego may manifest concurrently in different organisms. At the\nbase of the phenomenal process only a (\/nnsi-individuality is apparent.\n\f406 [Supplement.\nC, G. Massey.\n\"And the analogy of the ' secondary selves ' within ourselves will enable us\nto understand how several relatively-separate selves of consciousness can co\nexist within the same entity, and how unsafe it is to argue from temporary\nexclusiveness to ultimate distinctness. We may hold, then, that the indi\nvidual cells of a tree, or the individual polypes of azoophyte are the 'secondary\nselves ' of the lower organisms ; nor need the fact that they possess distinct\nphysical organisations and are under the proper conditions capable of spatially\ndistinct existence, perplex us when we reflect that Space was not found to be\nan ultimate reality.\"\nAnd in higher strata of life, including the human, we seem to get hints of\nthe same severance. \" Multiplex personality,\" to which the author here\nagain refers, is perhaps rather the converse phenomenon of undue inclusion,\nwithin a single organism, of distinct psychical combinations which might\nclaim distinct objective expression. But the ulterior significance may be\nsimilar. And in the division of the sexes has often been seen a suggestion of\nsundered individuality ; \" for neither men nor women are sufficient in them\nselves or complete representatives, either physically or spiritually, of\nhumanity.\"\nA summary characterisation of this book may specify as its key-note the\nidea of the relation between rational, or teleological, causation, and historical\nantecedents or conditions. The whole world-process is the effectuation of\nthe first through the second, the accommodation of the second to the first.\nThis is the adjustment of science to philosophy, of phenomena to the truth\nof things. And as our conception of the final end to be attained becomes\nclearer and more definite, so will our understanding of the stages of the\nprocess be more complete. Naturally, the first fallacy as to final causation\nis \" anthropocentric \" ; phenomenal man is for all things the end, and \" cork\ntrees grow in order to supply us with champagne corks.\" A metaphysical\nidea is conceived unmetaphysically. But when we see that a perfect social\nintegration\u2014our highest ideal\u2014implies perfection in the individual elements\nto be integrated, the conception of teleology obliges us to reinterpret\nthe transient self as a furtherance of true individuality. For it is then\nalso apparent that all defect in the individual is a falling short of individuality.\nThe potentiality of man is the metaphysical idea of his being ; in the words\nof a late American writer, elucidating a cognate conception in Indian philo\nsophy, '' an ideal capability stands fast in us as the real substance of our\nselves.\"1 There are many who feel and acknowledge this sentiment, yet\ndecline the attempt to give it metaphysical form or validity. It is the\nmerit of this book that it has made the attempt fearlessly, attacking the\nproblem with remarkable powers of philosophising from assumed data. And\nif it should be objected that the Transcendental Egos, emptied of all content\nat the origin of the world-process, seem too unreal for the conception of sub\njectivity to attach to them, it may be replied that the difficulty is not essen\ntially greater than that which we daily overcome, in the recovery of latent\nconsciousness. Nor is it at all more easy to conceive function as originating\nwith exercise than as anteceding it. We may be perplexed, indeed, to\nunderstand how the author can have persuaded himself that his hypothesis\nreally \" begins at the beginning.\" It is at least as easy to represent\n1 Johnson : Oriental Religions, p. 388. (The Sankhya.)\n\fSupplement.] \" Riddles of the Sphinx.\" 407\nthe anarchy of unrelated wills, necessitating their imposed paralysis and\ndormancy, as consequent on a \"Fall\" into self-centred Egoism, as to\nsuppose it an absolutely original condition. And if such conceptions are\nto be admitted into philosophy, perhaps a finer and juster supposition\nwould be that of a gradual reduction, to the zero point of extinction, sus\ntained by consciousness through progressive astringency and contraction of\nthe individual wills which had departed from the community of dependence\non a universal centre. Thus the divine agency would begin with the cosmic\nprocess, as a refilling of the vacant forms of consciousness, and a re-eliciting,\nin response to stimulation, of the human energies, as conceived by the\nauthor. But a philosophy of evolution properly and necessarily takes as its\nstarting point the chaos, however caused, of the elements of the future\ncosmic combination. The objection of philosophy is to the author's con\ntention that this beginning must be regarded as absolute.\nIt may be remarked, in conclusion, that the special interest of this book\nfor Psychical Research lies in the suggestion of non-equivalence of the\nphenomenal self-consciousness to a true subjectivity. The idea is certainly\nnot new, but it is here given a systematic expression in the relation of tele\nology to Evolution. And another very fruitful idea for our study is that which\ndiscovers an essential connection between the development of individuality\nand human solidarity. If a perfect society implies perfect community of\nsympathetic life, we must conceive the individual as in formal correspon\ndence with all the modes of a true humanity, and the special affinities mani\nfested in phenomena of telepathy may be regarded as faint anticipations of\nsi, general rapport which will be similarly immediate. The development of\nman will be marked and accompanied by continuous retreat of the threshold\n,of his consciousness, and the connection between his moral state and his\nspiritual powers will be constantly more apparent.\nC. C. Massey.\n\f408 [Supplement.\n\"The Occult Sciences.\"\nII.\n\"THE OCCULT SCIENCES.\" 1\n\"It is . . . an unpretending but useful task,\" says Mr. Edward Waite,\n\"which we have set ourselves to perform in the present volume, which,\nembraces, as we would claim, in a compressed and digested form, the whole\nscope of occult knowledge, expressed in the language of a learner.\"\nWhether such a task is or is not \" unpretending \" will partly depend upon\nwhat \" the whole scope of occult knowledge,\" as conceived by the author,\nturns out to be. The evidence for so-called occult science is diffused over\nmany literatures ; it includes at any rate a very large admixture of deliberate\nfraud and childish folly ; and, if it is to be presented seriously, it, above all\nthings, needs the support of some modern experiment\u2014some kind of proof\nthat there is some kind of reality in some at least of the marvels which are\ncopied from book to book as matters of such ordinary occurrence,\nLet us, then, in a very few words, consider Mr. Waite's claims to learning,\nto critical acumen, and to the production of experimental evidence.\nThe very defective \" List of Authorities \" at the end of the book gives no\nhigh notion of the author's qualifications as a scholar. His range of\nlanguages does not go beyond English, French, and Latin ; and through\nout his work the misprints (?) and mis-spellings are of just that type which\nindicates a somewhat shallow or second-hand acquaintance with at least his.\nLatin authorities. With such books, on the other hand, as Lee's Glimpses of\nthe Supernatural, Frances Lord's Christian-Science Healiwj, Dr. Hartmann's\nMagic, and Colonel Olcott's Theosophy, Religion, and Occult Science\u2014all of\nthese quoted as \"authorities \"\u2014we are disposed to allow our author a much\nfuller acquaintance.\nTo illustrate Mr. Waite's critical acumen it is only necessary to open the\nbook at random. On page 69, for instance, we find these words, spoken in\nall seriousness : \"For the practical part, or the method of communicating\nwith demons, the Grimorium Verum and the Grand Grimoire are said to be\nentirely sufficient.\" Who says so ? We suppose it is one of those \" living\nwriters who are specialists in distinct branches of esoteric science,\" who, as\nMr. Waite tells us in his preface, have lent him their valuable aid.\nWe must, however, in fairness add that although our author intellectually\nbelieves in the Black Magic of the Grand Grimoire, he morally disapproves\nof it, and points to a more excellent way. \"Every practical power,\" he says,\np. 58, \" which Black Magic can at the utmost offer to its initiates is guaran\nteed with tenfold additional capacity ... by the branch which is\ndenominated Divine. 'To be a Christian is hard,' said the impressed but\nvacillating pagan, and the heights of mystical sanctity are also laborious in\n1 The Occult Science* ; a Compenlium of Transcendental Doctrine and Experiment.\nBy Arthur Edward Waite. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trtibner and Co., 1891.\n\fSupplement.] 409\n\" The Occult Sciences.\"\ntheir ascent, but the apex of adeptship is far more easily attained by the\nhumanity which is called thereto, than is the diabolical condition which the\nBlack Magic that is behind Black Magic requires of its professors.\"\nAfter this solemn warning we shall do well to turn our impressed but vacil\nlating minds to the experimental proof which Mr. Waite offers us of the reali\nties underlying his chapters on \"Composition of Talismans,\" \"Kabbalism,\"\nand so forth. That some such verification is necessary he does at least profess\nto discern. \" The experiments,\" he says, \"which were the foundation of\nmagical doctrine and magical hypothesis are facts which are not to be\nevaporated by the severity of critical analysis ; they are the synthesis of the\nexperiments of the ages, and they can be verified by those who desire it.\"\nWe turned over many a page of Mr. Waite's work in search of these verifying\nexperiments. At last, in the last chapter, the cat, if such an expression be\nallowed us, issued gently from the bag. \"In the year 1874, Madame\nBlavatsky \" it is the story of the duplicated teacup after all. What\nmore is there to say ? Let him who still believes in the miracles of Mr.\nSinnett's Occult World as facts believe in Mr. Waite's Occult Sciences as\ntheory.
