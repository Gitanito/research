GOMALEz ON THE EXPERIMENTS OF M.\nCHARLES RICHET.\nWe have received from M. Theodore Brubns, a Russian member of\nthe Society, an account of an article by M. Gomalez, published in a\nw~ll-known Russian weekly medical paper Yratch (\"The Physician\") for\nMay 9\/21 and 16\/28, 1885, which offers some criticisms on M. Richet's\nexperiments as detailed in our Proceeding\" vol. II., p. 247. M.\nGomalez contends that much more than M. Charles Richet would\nadmit may be learnt and acted upon unconsciously by the person who is\ntrying to guess the thought, or perform the action desired. The\nlOurce of knowledge is imagined to be the slight involuntary sUers.-\ntions in the respiratory motions of the operator; these are very slight.\ncertainly, and cannot be in general perceived cOnIci0u8ly even when\nattention is directed to them. M. Gomalez himself has not been able\nto perceive them when himself playing the r6la of the percipient, but\nconceives that they may be perceived by other percipients who are in a\nstate of rapport with the agent; and show in this way an auditory\nhypenestbesia such as is often attested. That the respiratory move-\nments are slightly affected by many emotions is undoubted. It will be\nremembered that M. Richet brought forward some experiments in\nwhich A sat at one table, pointing to one letter after another, of an\nalphabet, with B watching him, .and three other persons, C, D, and E,\nat a second table, quite out of sight of the alphabet; C, D, and E\nengaged in conversation, but occasionally their table tilted, and B\nmarked the letter to which A's pen was then pointing. These letters\nwere found to produce approximations which could not be attributed\nto accident to words M. Richet was thinking of. M. Gomales, if\nwe understand him correctly, assumes that M. Richet was aware of\nwhat letter A was pointing to, and could not avoid revealing it to C.\nD. and E by the changes in his respiratory movements, which, though\nD\nDigitized by Google\n\f34 Journal oj Societgjor P81\/clliCIJI Be8eQrck. [Sept., 188&.\nunconsciously produced and unconsciously perceived, yet induced\nC, D, and E to tilt the table. M. Gomalez sUgge'1ta that this\nhypothesis might be tested by plugging the ears of those who sit at\nthe tilting table, whereby the \"respiratory impulses\" might be\ncut ott\n[The case, as M. Richet presented it, did not seem to us to be open\nto this criticism, for in his original essay he gave no indication that he\nwas aware of what letter A was pointing to; if he was, his desoription\nis seriously incomplete; if he was not, there could have been no timely\nemotion to cause him to alter his respiratory movements.]\nTHOUGHT-READING WITH AND WITHOUT CONTACT.\nI was glad to see in the July number of the JO'Urnal that the\nPresident had directed the special attention of the Society to the\nconsideration of the phenomena connected with Thought-transference.\nActing upon this suggestion, I have ventured to write the few remarks\nwhich follow, on the subject of Thought-transference, with and witkout\ncontact.\nI Ulink there is a tendency, somewhat to confuse actual Thought-\ntransference with contact, and muscle-reading; and too often to assign\nscientific explanations as elaborate as they are improbable to facts of\nthe simplest kind. Whenever experiments are performed with any\nkind of centact, we are always sure to find some person coming forward\nwith explanations far harder to accept than the actual phenomena\nthemselves. I feel sure many will bear me out in saying that there is\na large class of good and trustworthy percipients, from whom excellent\nresults have been obtained, who are never able to succeed without\ncontact. It has been mid that by continually experimenting, such\npersons would in time become able to thought-read witltOut contacl,\nbut I have never yet heard of such a case, and am inclined to believe\nthat there is always a large proportion of percipients who can only\nsuccessfully experiment with contact. This brings me directly to the\npoint I wish to discuss in this paper.\u2022\nAre all experiments in Thought-transference made with contact\nevidentially valueless 1 To this, I think, we must reply that, when\nmade under certain stringent conditions, such experiments are of the\nhighest value. It will, of course, be always exceedingly important to\ndistinguish carefully between a case of muscle-reading, and a genuine\ncase of Thought-transference, but, if the experiments be performed under\nihe conditions I shall presently describe, I think there wi1l be\nlittle difficuliy in doing so. It seems to me that, in their zeal to\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept.. 1885.] Journal qf 80cietg 1m- P,gc\/ucal ReBeorch. 35\nplace their results beyond the possibility of suspicion, many have gone\ninto the other extreme and have refused credence to really genuine and\ntruly valuable experiments. Again, the tests which are applied to\nexperiments witl, contact are often unneoessarily severe, and, indeed,\noften lndicrously so. People who have seen a clever man like Mr.\nIrving Bishop perform most wonderful feats when he is allowed contact\nimmediately jump to the conclusion that every other person who performs\nexperimentsin which there is any sort\u00b7 of contact must be a 'mtulcle-reader,\nnot a fJumgkt-nader, simply because Mr. Bishop's experiments have\nbeen shown to be merely muscle-reading. They forget, first of all, that\nthe conditions, under which contact is permitted, and the entire method\nof arriving at the result, are quite different j and also that it is not fair\nto apply the same tests to the experiments of a public performer, who\nhas probably given years to practising and acquiring every species of\ntrickery, and to those of private individuals, whose ordinary avocations\nwould render it impossible for them to have acquired the knowlEdge\nand skill necessary for performing the most difficult muscle.reading\nfeats.\nBesidp.5 thp..5e experiments are often made with children, whose\ntender age is sufficient guarantee of the impossibility of their succeed-\ning by means of intricate systems of signalling, and the other ways in\nwhich such phenomena are explained. Imagine a child of 8 or 9,\nfor instance, telling the number of n. bank-note by muscle-reading!\nWhich is most extraordinary 1 that the number should have been\nactually transferred to his mind from that of the agent, or that, at so\nearly an age, the child should have acquired the necessary skill to accom-\nplish the feat by means of muscle-reading 1 Besides, it is remarkable that\nthe number of successes in the reading of numbers by genuine thought-\nreading exceeds those attained by muscle-reading. Mr. Bishop often\nfailed at the bank-note test_ Again, I should think it would be of very\nlittle use to most people who have other things to occupy their minds,\nto spend their time in learning n. long system of deception, in order to\nmake people believe that they possess a genuine power of thought-\nreading j especially now, when it is pretty generally admitted that\nthoughts can be transferred from mind to mind. We may well ask,\ncui bMW 1 and are not likely to get a reasonable reply.\nAnd now for the condition necessary to obtain accurate results\nfrom experiments made witl, contact. The percipient should first be\ntaken out of the room and blindfolded. During his absence, a number\nshould be written down, or a card selected from the pack, or an object\nthought of, as the case may be j only one person, the agent, should know\nwhat is chosen. The percipient should then be brought in and seated\nat a tab!e, and if he desires contact it should be permitted, care being\ntaken that in no case shall the percipient be allowed to grasp the agent's\nG D21\nDigitized by oog e\n\f36 Journal of 80cietg fo,. PB1\/chical Rt.aearcA. (Sept., 1885.\nhand, and then, while holding it, write down the number gradually, for\nthis would be muscle-reading. The percipient, after a short time, should\nbe asked if he knows what has been selected; contact should be with-\ndrawn and then he should at once tell the object chosen. The carrying\nout of these conditions will, I think, be sufficient to ensure results of\nreal value, but of course any person can make such alterations as they\nmay wish if they are inclined to be extra careful. I have experimented\nwith friends witl, contact somewhat in the way I have described, and\nhave obtained very successful results, even words of 3 letters being\nread by the percipients, and I have found from 30 to 50 seconds\ngenerally sufficient. Of course there were failures, but sometimes of a\nremarkable kind, as 564 instead of 465. In conclusion, I think that I\nhave shown the value of experiments even witl, contact, though I cannot\nbut admit that those witlwut contdct are more satisfactory. I hope that\nwe may have further accounts from members who have found, like\nmyself, that a large number of percipients can only be successful with.\neontact.\nOCTAVIUS BEATl'Y.\nExeter College, Oxford.\nWe agree with Mr. Beatty that there is some reason to suppose that\ncontact may \/l-88ist genuine thoughtrtransference, and to prove this\nwould itself distinctly advance our knowledge of the subject. Weagree\nwith him, too, that it is not always, and for all purposes, necessary, to\nimpose conditions intended to exclude either codes or conscious muscle-\nreading. But he scarcely seems to us to attach enough importance to\nthe difficulty of guarding against muscle-reading of which both. agent\nand percipient are unconscious. And this is what we think usually\noccurs in the willing game; the impulse which the percipient receives,\nhe knoW's not how, to perform some action, having really come to him\nthrough slight unconscious motions of the agent quite unconsciously\nperceived.\nFor example, we witnessed on one occasion the remarkable success in\nthe willing game of two ladies, sisters, whose bonajideIJ was beyond\nsuspicion, nnd who were themselves convinced that the process was\nentirely mental. The lady who acted as agent tried to influence\nanother person, but failed. It then occurred to this gentleman instead\nof waiting for an impulse, to try to follow any lead that might be\ngiven him through the a~nt's hands. He succeeded at once, slowly it\nis true, but he was without practice. The agent had no idea that she\nhad given any indications, but as they were given on this occasion it\nseems probable that they were always given, and that her sister was un-\nconsiously influenced by them. It seems not unlikely that children.\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept., 1885.] Journal of Society\/or P81\/cAicallleaearcll. 31\nbeing less self-conscious and less accustomed to analyse their impulses\nwhil~ more accustomed to act on them than their elders, might be good\nmuscle-readers of this unconscious sort.\nThe indications in the case described consisted in slight and almost\nindefinable changes in the way the hands rested on the percipient's\nshoulders, according as the agent was satisfied or dissatisfied with what\nthe percipient was doing; but indications of another kind may be un-\nconsciously given. A lady we know was trying as percipient to repro-\nduce diJl,grams in the manner which has several times been described in\nthe Procwling,; but thinking it might be easier at first with contact,\nthe agent put his hand on her head. She presently perceived that he\nwas moving his band slightly but without letting it slip on her head, in\nsuch a way as to indiCl\\te the figure, and she reproduced it with great\nsuccess. A less self-conscious, and very likely therefore better, perci-\npient might perhaps have become aware what the figure was without\nknowing how.\nWe hope that Mr. Beatty and all other memoors of the Society who\nhave opportunities of trying systematic and careful experiments will do\n80, and send a full account of them, describing the conditions observed,\nand noting 11011 the results--failures as well as successes. All our own\nexperience tends to show that the persons able to obtain clearly success-\nful results in genuine thought-transference are few, and more experi-\nments and records of them are very much wanted, hoth to convince\nthe world that thought-transference is a reality and further to elucidate\nthe whole subject.-[En.]\nPHANTASMS O~' THE DEAD.\nWe have received the following remarks on the paper which\nappeared under the above title in the Proceeding\" Part VIII., from Mr.\nC. A. Goodhart, a Member of the Society.\n\" On p. 99 Mrs. Sidgwick says ' there is some reason to think that a.\ntelepathic impression may remain latent for a time, &c.' This had\nalready occurred to me as a possible explanation of the cases cited in the\nimmediately preceding context. P. Junior's desire to see Mr. Lewis seems\nsufficient to have produced a. mental transfer which might only have\natrected the field of consciousness, through sub-conscious associations\nauggested by the sight of the closed house. The transfer would be like\nthe impression on a sensitive photographic plate, which is only recognis-\nable under suitable conditions resulting from after manipulation. Mr.\nD.'s experience I should be inclined to explain in the S9-me way. If an\nunconscious transfer was produced by young Mackenzie at the time of\ndeath, it might possibly become recognisable through transferred\nDigitized by Google\n\f38 Journal qf Societ1\/ .for P'1\/chical ReMarcA. [SPpt., 1885.\nsuggestion from Mrs. D., when she opened and read the letter; which\nmust have been when her husband had the dream.\n\" As regards the Haunted House question, what has occurred to me\nis this :-May it not be possible that, at the point of death, the energy\nwhich results in some cases in the mental tra.nsfer of an apparition, may\nin others secure a transfer which produces an increase in the 'permanent\npossibilities of sensation\" in the material surroundings1 The effect would\nbe th.at,to a sensitive observer, suggestions would be given,unintelligible\nto others, related to the past intelligence which had at first effected their\nproduction. It is, of course, pure hypothesis, but it seems tentatively to\nfit the facts, and even such a case as Mr. Bro wning's studs-which\nseems natura.lly explicable by direct thought-tra.nsference - might\npossibly be found to come under it. Haunted studs are not apriori,\nmore impossible thanhaunted houses. So far as I can see, in the evidence\nthere is but little to favour the view that the dead, qu4 dead, can or do\ncommunicate with the living. At the same timeit seems very much as\nthough we had traces of persistent energy which may have been released\nduring life, and can still be recognised under favourable conditions.\n\" You will pa.rdon me for writing this, but, in a subject which is\ninvolved in so much obscurity, the wildest guesses may be worth con-\nsidering as suggesting lines for experiment and observation.\"\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\n(Continued. )\nL.-815.-Ad pn\n[The following account was received from a gentleman of good position,\nwhom I must term Mr. A. Z. He has given me the full names of all pe1'llOnB\nconcerned, but is unwilling that they should be published on account of the\npainful character of the event recorded.-F. W. H. M.]\nMa'J, 1885.\nIn 1876, I was living in a small agricultural pariah in the East of England,\none of my neighbours at the time being a young man, S. B., of. who had\nrecently come into the occup'&tion of a large farm in the place. Pending the\nalteration of his house he lodged and boarded with his groom at the other\nend of the village furthest removed from my own residence, which was half\na mile distant and separated by many houses, gardens, a plantation and farm\nbuildings. He was fond of field sports and spent much of his spare time\nduring the season in hunting. He was not a personal friend of mine, only\nan acquaintance, and I felt no interest in him except as a tenant on the\nestate. I have asked him occasionally to my house as a matter of civility,\nbut to the beat of my recollection was never inside his lodgings.\nOne afternoon in March, 1876, when leaving, along with my wife, our\n\u2022 These are not the proper initials of hill name.\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept., 1885.)

I may no.. state that the distance from this gate, going\nalong the carriage drive, to tho dining and breakf..t-room windows is about\n60yards, both the windo..... of these rooma face the north-eaat and are parallel\nwith the carriage drive. On S.B. taking leave of us my ..ife remarked,\n\"Young B. evidently wished tobeasked in, but Ithought you would not care to\nbe troubledwith him.\" Subsequently_bout half\u00b7an-hour later-Iagain met\nhim, and, .. I .... then on my way to look at lOme work at a distant part of\nthe estate, asked him to walk with me,which he did. His conve1\"ll&tion .... of\nthe ordinary character; if anything, he seemed somewhat depreued at the bad\ntimes and the low prices of farming produce. I remember he ..ked me to\ngive him lOme wire rope to make a fence on his farm, which I consented to \u2022\ndo. Returning from our walk, and on entering the village, I pulled up at\nthe CfOIII-roada to say good evening, the road to his lodgings taking him at\nright angles to mine. I ....surpriaed to hear him say, .. Come and smoke a\ncigar with me to-night 1\" To which I replied, \"I cannot very well, I am\nengaged this eveniruJ.\"\" Do come,\" he said. \"No,\" I Nplied \"Iwill look in\nanother~evening.\" And with this we parted. We had separated about 40 yarde\nwhen he turned around and exclaimed, \"Then if you will not come, good-\nbye.\" This .... the laat time I saw him alive.\nI spent the evening in my dining-room in writing, and for lOme hOUri I\nmay say that probably no thought of young B. paued through my mind;\nthe night 11''' bright and clear, full or nearly full moon, still and without\nwind. Since I had come in slight snow had fallen, just sufficient to make\nthe ground show white.\nAt about 5 minutes to 10 o'clock I got up and left the room, taking up\na lamp from the hall table and replacing it on a small table standing in a re-\ncess of the window in the breakf..t-room. The curtains were not drawn\nacross the window. I had just taken down from the nearest bookcase a\nvolume of \"Macgillivray's British Birds\" for reference, and \"\u00b7M in the act\nof reading the pasaage, the book held close to the lamp, and my shoulder\ntouching the window shutter, and in a position in which almost the slightest\noutside lOund would be heard, when I distinctly heard.the front gate opened\nand shut again with a clap, and footsteps advancing at a run up the drive;\nwhen opposite the window the steps changed from sharp and distinct on\ngravel to dull and 1888 clear on the grass slip below the window, and at the\nsame time I 11''' conscious that someone or something stood close to me\noutside, only the thin shutter and a sheet of gl&ll dividing us; I CQuld hear\nthe quick panting laboured breathing of the measenger, or whatever it w..,\nu if trying to recover breath before speaking. Had he been attracted by\nthe light through the shutter 1 Suddenly, like a gunshot, inside, outside,\nand all around, there broke out the most appalling ahriek-a prolonged wail\nof horror, which seemed to freeze the blood. It 11'''not a single shriek, but\nmore prolonged, commencing in a high key and then 1888 and 1888, wailing\naway towards the north, and becoming weaker and weaker &I it receded in\nlObbing pulsations of intense agony. Of my fright and horror I can say\nnothing-increased tenfold when I walked into the dining-room and found\nm1 wife sitting quietly at her work close to the window, in the same line and\nDigitized by Google\n\f40 Journal of Society for P,yckical Re,earck. rSep&..1885.\ndiatant only 10 or 12 feet from the corresponding window in the b~\nroom. She had hetJrd nothing. I could see that at once; and from the poai-\ntion in which she was Bitting I knew ahe could not have failed to hear any\nnoise outside and any footstep on the gravel. Perceiving I W88 alarmed\nabout something, ahe asked, \"What is the matter ~\" \"Only aomeone\noutside,\" I said. \"Then why do you not go out and see 7 You always do\nwhen you hear any unusual noile.\" I said, \"there is something ao queer\nand dreadful about the noise. I dare not face it. It must have been the\nBanshee shrieking.\"\nYoung S. B., on leaving me, went home to his lodgings. He spent\nmoat of the evening on the sofa, reading one of Whyte Melville's novels.\nSaw his groom at 9 o'clock and gave him orders for the following day.\nThe groom and his wife, who were the only people in the house besides S. B.t\nthen went to bed.\nAt the inquest the groom stated that when about falling asleop, he W88sud-\ndenly aroused by a shriek, and on running into his master's room found him\nexpiring on the floor. It appeared that young B. had undreaaed upstairs.\nand then came down to his sitting-room in trousers and nightshirt, had\npoured out half-a-glasa of water, into which he emptied a small bottle of\npruaaic acid (procured that morning under the plea of poisoning a dog, which\nhe did not pOlBelB). He walked upataira, and on entering his room drank\noff'the glasa, and with a scream fell dead on the floor. All this happened,\n88 near as I can ascertain, at the exact time when I had been so much\nalarmed at my own house. It is utterly impolBible that any sound short of\na cannon shot could have reached me from B.'s lodgings, through closed win-\ndows and doors, and the many intervening obstacles of hoUBel and gardena,\nfarmsteads and plantations, &c.\nHaving to leave home by the early train, I was out very lOOn on the\nfollowing morning, and on going to examine the ground beneath the window\nfound no foouteps on graBI or drive, still covered with the alight sprinkling of\nInow which had fallen on the previous evening.\nThe whole thing had been a dream of the moment-an imagination, call\nit what you will; I simply state these facts as they occurred, without\nattempting any explanation, which, indeed, I am totally unable to give.\nThe entire incident is a mystery, and will ever remain a mystery to me. I\ndid not hear the particulars of the tragedy till the following afternoon,\nhaving left home by an early train. The motive of suicide was said to be &\nlove affair.\nIn a subsequent letter dated June 12th, 1885, Mr. A. Z. says;-\nI have no objection to the publication of the narrative on the terms you\nmention (i.e., avoiding all chance of recognition}and omitting my name.

I have evidence of all this\nto llatiafy any lawyer.\nI went early the next morning under the window to look for footsteps\njust before leaving home for the day. Perhapa it ill not quite correct to call\nit IInow; it was llmall frozen sleet and hail, and the grass blades just peeped\nthrough, but there was quite enough to have shown any stepa had there been\nany.\nI was not myself at the inquest, so in that case only speak from he&rll&Y.\nIn my narrative I llay the groom was awoke by \"a shriek.\" I have asked\nthe man [name given], and c1'08ll-questioned him closely on this point; and\nit is more correct to lI&y by \"a series of noises ending in a crash\" or \"heavy\nfall.\" This is most probably correct, as the son of the tenant [name given]\nliving in the next house was &roused by the same .art of I01md coming\nthrough the wall of the house into the adjoining bedroom in which he was\nsleeping.\nI do not, however, wish it to be understood that any material noises heard\nin that house or the next had any connection with the peculiar noises and\n8Cl'8an1 which frightened me so much, as'anyone knowing the locality must\nadmit at once the imposaibility of such sounds travelling under any conditiona\nthrough intervening obatacles. I only lI&y that the scene enacted in the one\nwas coincident with my alarm and the phenomena attending it in the other.\nI find by reference to the book of [name given], chemist, of --, that\nthe poison was purchased by young S. B., on March 8th. I enclose a note\nfrom Mrs. A. Z., according to your request.\nThe enclosed note, signed by Mrs. A. Z., also dated June 12th, 1885, is\n88 follows :-\nI am able to testify that on the night of March 9th, 1876, about\n10 o'clock, my husband, who had gone into the adjoining room to conault a\nbook, was greatly alarmed by sounds which he heard, and described as the\ngate clapping, footsteps on the drive and grass, and heavy breathing close to\nthe window-then a fearfulacreaming.\nI did not hear anything.\nHe did not go to look round the house, as he would have done at any\nother time, and when I afterwardll asked him why he did not go out, he\nreplied, \"Because I felt I could not.\"\nOn going to bed he took his gun upstairs; and when I asked him why,\nsaid, \"Because there must be someone about.\"\nHe left home early in the morning, and did not hear of the suicide of\nMr. B. B. until the afternoon of that day.\nAn article which we have seen in a local newspaper, narrating the suicide\nand inquest, confirms the above account of them.\nL-I064.-A.d pn\nOf the occurrence about to be uarrated, we have received three in,\ndependent accounts, all at second band, of which one dift'era very con-\nDigitized by Google\n\f42 Journal qf 80cisty for P8!Jcllical Re8earcA.

They a.gree, indeed, in little except the\nfact that an apparition of fishermen was seen by Colonel Campbell.\nThe first has the advantage of corroboration, but even apart from this\nthe reader will, we think, at once judge it to be the more trustworthy.\nThe se(.ond account is very like the first, but adds an incident\nwhich, from the fact that we have never met with it in first hand\nnarratives, we should judge to be improbable, namely, that the appari-\ntion was seen again at the same spot on returning to it. If this really\noccurred, it would suggest that either the real men were seen or some\nreal object was mistaken for them. Mrs. Ricardo and Mr. Lcring are\nboth under the impression that the apparitions were seen bifOf\"e the\ndeath, but in the absence of evidence as to when the boat capsized,\nthis seems an unnecessary assumption. On the whole, we may\nproba.bly take it as certain that Colonel Campbell ha.d good reason\nto believe that he saw apparitions of the two men on the night on\nwhich they were drowned, but beyond this we cannot now go.\nFrom Mrs. Ricardo.\n8, Oheaham Street, S.W.\nApril 6th, 188U.\nMrs. Campbell died three months ago. I can only recolleot the story\nyou refer to, rather imperfectly, though I have often heard my father,\nthe late Oolonel Campbell, of Skipnesa, tell it. The facta were these:-\nOn a fine summer's evening, between 8 and 9 o'clock (still quite light\nin the Highlands), about 40 years ago or more, my father was walking\nto the old ruined castle of Skipnesa, which was a short distance from the\nmore modem house. He had fitted up a turning lathe and workshop in\none of the old rooms, and was going to fetch some tool which he bad\nforgotten in the day. As he approached tho gate of the courtyard he\nsaw two of the fishermen (brothers), Walter and John Oook, leaning\nagainst the wall rather stitlly. Being in a hurry he merely nodded, said\nsomething about ita being a fine evening, and went in. He was sur-\nprised that they did not answer him, which was very unlike the usual\ncustom, but being in a hurry did not think much of it, and when he returned\nthey were gone. That night a Budden gale sprang up in the middle of the\nnight.

There was a peculiar\nlight upon her though no light of any kind in the roum. Another peculiarity\nabout my aunt that my mother noticed was, that a large lock of my aunt's\nhair had been cut straight off close to the temple. The apparition appeared\nto gaze steadily at my mother for eomo little time, and then gradually\ndisappeared.\nMy mother, to wholll such appearances were not altogether unknown, felt\nso cunvinced something serious had happened to my Aunt Fanny, that,\nfearing a shock to my father, she tuok lI1ea~ures to intercept the letters to\nmy father which she was satisfied must bring him sad news of eome eort\nrelating to my aunt. The event proved her right, for in due course of post\nfrom home came the letter bearing intelligence of my aunt's unexpected\ndeath at sea (Mrs. Gray was journeying from the Cape of Good Hope to\nEngland when she died), on the nigbt above mentioned, and in the letter was\nenclosed a large lock of my aunt Fanny's hair which had been cut off to send\nto my father.\nI was a child of 5 or G years of age when the above took place, and\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, though not the particulars, whicb\nare, however, exactly as I have often heard my mother relate them to\ndifferent people.\nFANE SBWELL.\nIn sending the above two narratives, Colonel Sewell writes :-\nI h'lve been delayed by an endeavour, if pouible, to get exact dates.

Of this I\ncan of course only dimly remembor the circumstances, and merely ml\"ntion\nit here to show that I was very impre8llionable as a child, and began to\nremember much earlier than the date of my Aunt Fanny's death. I have\nno doubt in my own mind, therefore, of the phenomenon having occurred to\nmy m<.ther as described by her.\n(3) (a) Am I aware as to whether my mother was in the habit of having\nsimilar visitations or visions which did not correspond with anything 1 or (b),\nof her being subject to hallucinations 1\n(a) I am not aware of any such. I do know, however, of one occur-\nrence which took place in February or March, 1857, whilst I was staying,\nen rouu to India, with my father and mother at Piaa. I was then a young\nman of nineteen.\nI remember my mother came down to breakfast one morning greatly\nagitated, and told us (my father and me) that she had been awakened during\nthe night by something unusual occurring, and saw distinctly a curious\nflame-like light at the end of her bed, which took no definite shape but faded\naway and left the room again dark. She said she was quite sure that some-\nthing had happened to a near relative who was then in London. My father\ntried to re&B8ure my mother, but she was not to be diuuadod from her\npresentiment of evil (I should mention that my father and mtther occupied\nseparate rooms in those days.) A few days afterwards we received letters\nfrom England informing us that the relative in question had had a sudden\nand dangerous illn088-in fact, a dangerous miscarriage-on the night in\nquestion.\n(b) I never heard Qf any other C8.8CS of vision, or otherwise, occurring\nto my mother, nor am I aware of my mother having been subject in any\nway to hallucinations of the senses.\nThe occurrences I havo mentioned were wide apart as regards time.

This W&8 the only time\nI ever saw him in the form of a. \" ghost.\"\nW. R.

He W&8 like\" Pepper's Ghost\"\nas regards substance, or rather want of substance. He advanced ~ually\ntowards me, which made me feel a littIe nervous and looked kindly at me. I\nadvanced a little and said, \"James, why do you not speak 1\" which utterance\nseemed to make him recede. HE! retired aUttle down the room and gradually\nbecame more indistinct and disappeared. None of the friends seemed to\ntake any decided notice, and did not speak. I then woke.\nI do not think I can aft'ord any corroboration. On the afternoon of the\nome day, I mentioned the matter to my aunt a.nd her husband. She is now\ndead, and I do not think my uncle would recollect tile account, I did not\nmake much of it, as I was a disbeliever in ghosts.\nI dared not mention the occurrence to my mother &8 she would have grieved\nall day about my brother if I had.\nI have never had any other similar instance. I have had relations die\nbut have been near them at the time of the death.\n\\Y. H.

All day SUllday, however, I was wondering how my brotherwaa\nand when I saw my sister on the Monday I thought of the I!Itrange coincidence.\n2. NOlie of the other friends had a hazy appearance. They were in\nordinary attire 88 I should l!Iee them in a room. My brother was the only\n\" ghostly\" figure.\n3. My I!ister recollects when I!Ihe informed me (of the\" time\" of the\ndeath) on the Monday that I remarked \"How strange! that is tho time I\naaw James at my bedside.\"\nI had no reason to oxpect my brother's death at the timo it did take\nplace. except an expectation that ono's worst fears might at any time be\nrealised in a case where consumption had taken hold.\nMy brother in his vision was not attired but appeared only as a misty or\nghostly figure. Tho term .. Pepper's Ghol!lt,\" has always struck me as the\nmost applicable. There was nothing like the appearanco of any ordinarily\ndreeaed being in my brothor's caae, although, aa to the other beings\napparently in the room, it was otherwise. It was, as it were, my brother's\nface with a film of drapery to support it in the shape of a human figure, or\nsufficiently near to the shape that drapery would give. To have l!Iuppol!led\nattire was an existent would have almost brought with it the power or idea\nof walking, but when-aa it were-I insisted upon the \"ghost\" speaking\nthere was a slight movement backward and a gradual disappearance by\nabsorption as a mist or cloud sometimes disappears when the sun comes\nforth.\nI have not kept any copy of my letters but I think that I mentioned thaI,\nmy forcing or insisting upon a reply seemed to bo tile cause of my waking and\nI had to look round to gather myself together and ascertain that I was in bed\nwhen I 80 awoke.\nThA following is from Mr. Brooks' sister, Mrs. Plaistowe.\n.At'9U8t 4th, 1885.\nIn answer to your letter I have to state that my brother William on his\narriving at Hastings in November, 1875, and being informAd by me of the\nhour of my late Brother James's death (viz., II. quarter to 8 a.m.) said that it\nexactly coincided with the time that he, my brother William, saw James in a.\nspirit or vision.\nI may remark that the death was unexpected by the members of the\nfanlily, as James was away from home with me at Hastings and although he\nhad been suffering from consumption for three or four years no intimation\nof his becoming worse had been received by anyone in the family, so that.\nmy brother's statement to you is corroborated by me.\nM.

That\noccurred on the 17th December, 1882-110 Sunday morning. As I was here,\nI asked my sister-in-law about it afresh, a few minutes ago, and she baa\nconfirmed it in every particular, telling us about the doctor not being at\nhand, and about the child being dead, wMch we had not heard before, as she\ncommunicated only briefly by letter at the time, mentioning the fact of her\ndream and the confinement_ This can be attested in the strongest fonn.\nall my sister-in-law is extremely intelligent, and my brother the principal\nmedical man in this town of Linlithgow.\nIt may further be mentioned in explanation that when my wife had her\nfir.t child in Edinburgh, a year before that, my sister-in-law, the doctor'.\nwife, stayed with her for about a month, and was present at the birth.\nThus she took a warm interest in us.\nThe following is from Mrs. Hunter :-\nSt. Catherine's, Linlithgow,\nJuly 23nl, 1885.\nDEAR Sm.-My brother-in-law forwarded your letter and asked me W\nTeply to it.\nI I~m almost afraid to give particulars about the dream I had, as it isnow\nBome time ago, and I had not been remembering it much. I wrote to Mr.\nHunter at the time, and he has unfortunately not kept my letter, 80 I must\ntrust to my memory.\nThe date I do not recollect. The time was 2 o'clock I think. I knew\nthen, as I looked at my watch when I awoke, and Mr. Hunter told me it\nwas just the hour at which the event took plACe.\nI thought I was at the Manse Cockburnapath, wherehe lives, and I saw\nMrs. Hunter evidently ill. She went to her room. I heard the doctor',\ntrap pass the house, and every one was rushing to get him, but he was gone.\nMy sister-in-law kept calling for me, but I could not reach her. By-and-\nDye a doctor arrived, and the nuree, a stranger to me, came to my room\nwith an infant.\nShe was putting white satin on the dreaa, and I remonstrated, saying\nthat was only for dead infants. She replied, \"and isn't it right to do it\nto this one 1II and I looked and saw the cMld was dead, and I knew it was a\nboy. I awoke, felt anxious, fell aaleep, and again dreamt the same, except,\nI think, the first part, that of seeing Mrs. Hunter. I did not dream three\ntimes as Mr. Hunter fancied.\nWhen I awoke I just remarked to my husband I hoped nothing had gone\nwrong, and told him my dream during breakfast.\nNot hearing anything for two days I had almostdismiaaed all thought of\nit from my mind, but I 11'1\\8 1\\ little surprised to find I bad been dreaming a\nfact.\nI knew quite well that my sister-in-law expected her confinement, but !\nhad no misgivings, as ahe had been ao strong before.\nDigitized by Google\n\fSept., 1885.] Journal qf Socittglor P'!lchicailleaenrcla.\nI had engaged a nune for her, and ahe waa not the woman I saw in my\ndream.

We usually hear from her on the Monday\nevenings, and it is very possible that she might have mentioned it in such II.\nJl(Ite ; but I am sorry that I cannot definitely recall it, as the letters are\nalmost always addreaaed to my wife, and not to myself. I find from my diary,\nhowet'er, that I met Mrs. Hunter of Linlithgow on the Tuesday following, in\nEdinburgh, and went out with her to Linlithgow; and I am perfectly\npositive that I heard of it on that Tuesday, if not on the night before. I\nhave always regarded it aa a strange occurrence, and have no manner of\ndoubt that her dream corresponded, in a ~e measure, with the actual\nevent. The event took place about 1 o'clock in the morning. I understand\nthat my sister-in-law dreamt three times ot'er that morning that my wife\nwaa ill. Itis poaaible that one of the times would agree with the hour. If\nnot, there could not be a great difference. I have only heard my sister-in-\nlaw give the particulars once I think, and I do not know what account !\\he\nDigitized by Google\n\f56 Journal of Society\/or P'1lcAical Re8ttzrch.

Well, the doct()r was cer-\ntainly not present, buthe lives quite near us, and was got in a few minutes,\nand to that extent there was a discrepancy, if the meaning of that part of the\ndream, is not that the doctor was not in immediate attendance. But that of\ncourse isa very slight point, and can, on the above interpretation, be easily\nreconciled.\nJuly 30th, 1885.\nI mentioned in my last, as a sort of discrepancy to one thing I had heard,\nthat the doctor was not far away, Mra. Hunter tella me that was not her\nmeaning, but that she saw Dr. Black, our medical practitioner, drive past\nher window, and that he was not at home. True enough, Dr. Black was not\nat home at the time, but on a short holiday in Fife and elsewhere. He had\nan aaaistant in his place and it was the &BBistant, Dr. Basil, now at Melroee\nAaylum, who came after the confinement was about over.\nI think I mentioned when writing at firat that the confinement was\npremature and not expected for about two months. Mra. Hunter, of\nLinlithgow, had arranged with my wife to come here during the confinement,\nbut there was no expectation of it at the time.\nL.-2332.-Acl PI\nThe following account of a dream is from the German nurse of Mrs.\nBalgarnie, of 9, Filey Road, Scarborough.
