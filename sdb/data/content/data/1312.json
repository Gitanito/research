This belated journal is an exceptional example of the decayed state of American spiritualism, but it is filled with the minutiae of the movement at that time: movements of mediums; advertisements for \"spiritual advice by mail\" from Lake Charles, Louisiana, and for a \"Spiritual Postoffice\" (\"Personal slate-writings by mail $2.00) to be contacted through the journal; a call for new members from the Institute of Life \/ Institute of Hyperphysical Research in New York; announcement of a \"Court of Verity\" to be organized by J. Gilbert E. Wright, \"industrial research scientist and psychic investigator\" to judge lying and impersonating spirits; and news of the passing of \"Margery\" (Mrs. Mina S. Crandon) and the announcement of her spirit's appearing at seances; note of Noel Coward's \"Blythe Spirit,\" a comedy on spirit return; the return of Elbert Hubbard's spirit and its resolution to continue his Little Journeys \"from the Spirit,\" etc.  The journal was obviously started on a shoestring and announced its resolve to make each issue stand on its own financial footing.  It was intended to be sold in bulk (50 copies minimum) to spiritualist churches and mediums around the country and for a slight additional charge the journal would include a personalized page about the subscribing church.  The first issue announced its arrangement with the Silent Worker of Fort Scott, Kansas, by the Rev. Nellie McElroy to publish that journal as a supplement in the Leader.  Advertised in the Culturist, 1949.  The issue for June 13, 1948 (no. 307) was in the estate of Hereward Carrington.  University of Manitoba.  \t      Issues:New York Spiritualist Leader V1 N1 Nov 16 1941         <\/p>\n\n  \r\nIAPSOP materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License. \r\n IAPSOP respects people's privacy and personal data rights.             <\/HTML>\n\n[1] http:\/\/iapsop.com\/archive\/materials\/new_york_spiritualist_leader","_id":1312}
