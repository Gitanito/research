In\nparticular, grateful acknowledgment is due to Sir Oliver Lodge,\nMr. Piddington, Mrs. Sidgwick, and Miss Johnson for constant\nhelp, not only in the investigation of the phenomena them\nselves, but also in the actual preparation of this report.\nMany other persons named or indicated in the following\npages have been so kind as to check the accuracy of the\nstatements made respecting them, and I beg them to accept\nmy cordial thanks.\n\f2 Table of Contents.

[PART\nPART I.\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE SCRIPT.\nCHAPTER I.\nINTRODUCTORY.\nTHE present paper is an attempt to give as complete an\naccount as possible of the phenomena of automatic writing\nwhich have occurred since I first found myself able to\nproduce such writing, in March, 1901. The mass of detail is\nso considerable, and the confusion and obscurity in the writing\nitself so great, that if I were to reproduce the whole script as\nit stands, even a very full commentary would fail to make it\nintelligible ; many of the episodes would need elaborate comment\nas well as frequent notes ; there is much apparent rubbish ;\nmuch of the information, which I believe to be contained in\nthe script, is only to be obtained by piecing together sentences\noccurring in different bits of writing often separated from one\nanother by considerable intervals of time ; and at least half\nthe original writing, being in Latin or Greek, would require\ntranslation. It has therefore seemed best to give first a general\naccount of the writing, of its origin, development, and nature,\nand then to treat in detail of various episodes, selected and,\nwhere possible, isolated from the surrounding mass.\nI have not been able, as I should have wished, to make a\ncomplete classification of the contents of the automatic script,\nas much of the matter still remains too obscure for such a\nprocess, and moreover there is a danger that, in the desire for\ncomplete classification, meanings which they do not legitimately\nbear may be put upon some parts of the writings, or episodes\n\fLin.] Introductory. 7\nmay be pressed prematurely into the service of some explana\ntory hypothesis. At the same time it seemed to me that the\nonly hope of making the subject intelligible lay in some sort\nof provisional classification, but I have not attempted to make\nthis classification exhaustive or exclusive, so that, at the risk of\nwearying the reader by repetition, some topics are treated\nunder more than one head.\nAnother and a much greater difficulty than any of the pre\nceding lies in the personal nature of many of the writings.\nWith this I have dealt as best I could. Certain parts of the\nscript have been omitted. In some cases pseudonyms have\nbeen substituted for the names of real persons, or identity\notherwise disguised. No other alterations have been made.\nIt would be useless to give any positive estimate of what has\nbeen omitted ; but I think it right to say that the script has\ncertainly not gained, but lost, by the omissions. Matter pre\njudicial to its value and interest is more than proportionally\nrepresented in the parts actually now published.\nBefore proceeding to a general account of the appearance\nand contents of the script itself, it seems necessary to say\nsomething of its origin and development.\nHISTORY.\nEarly attempts.\nFor some considerable number of years I have been in\nterested in automatic phenomena, and have tried to obtain\nthem in various ways. My experiences in Crystal Gazing\nduring the years 1889-1892 were recorded and published in\nthe Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., p. 473, et seq. With a few\ndoubtful exceptions the pictures so seen were purely fantastic.\nWith Planchette or a table, if I have sat with a second person,\nI have usually obtained movements, though the results were\nseldom of any interest; but till recently I was quite unable\nto get any movement with Planchette when sitting alone, or\nany writing with a free pencil, except a few letters repeated\nin meaningless combinations, e, v, r, appearing and reappearing\nas \"every, very, ever,\" and so on. It is probable that the\nletters of my surname, the word most frequently written\n\f8 \u2022 Chapter 1. [PART\nIn ordinary life without conscious effort, were responsible\nfor the words produced.\nI had come to the conclusion that automatic writing was\nnot possible to me; but in January, 1901, I resolved to make\na fresh attempt, and on this occasion the attempt was more\npersistent than had been the case with the earlier efforts.\nRenewed attempts.\nOn Jan. 19, 1901, I spent a quarter of an hour or more\nin sitting perfectly still in a very dim light, with a view to\ngiving myself the opportunity of recognising any impression\nthat I might have. I continued this daily, and after two or\nthree days I put my hand on a Planchette or held a pencil.\nBut I obtained no satisfactory results. Unless my attention\nwere actively engaged in some other direction the pencil did\nnot move ; if I tried to occupy my attention with reading,\nthe pencil merely reproduced some of the words of the book,\nor occasionally traced characters resembling those on a brass\ntable on which the pencil and paper lay ; Planchette was\naltogether useless. After Feb. 2 I left off the attempts for\nsome days, and two later attempts on Feb. 12 and 13 pro\nduced no better results. I made no further effort till March\n3 and again on March 5 ; it was on this latter date that\nwhat I regard as the first successful result was obtained.\nSuccessful attempts ; script obtained in Latin.\nWhen I resumed the attempt in March, I decided not to\nendeavour to distract my attention by reading but to let my\nmind passively follow any suggestions which might come from\nmovements of the pencil or otherwise. On March 3 much\nthe same sort of thing was written as in the earlier attempts,\nwords not making any intelligible sense but not wholly dis\nconnected ; these words were followed by Greek letters, Greek\nwords, and odd signs. On the second occasion, March 5, at\nfirst the words presented themselves to me as wholes, but the\nsequence was unintelligible ; then I suddenly felt a strong\nimpulse to change the position of the pencil and to hold it\nbetween the thumb and first finger. Ever since an attack of\nwriter's cramp, some sixteen years ago, I have held the pen\nor pencil between the first and second finger, and I had\n\fLIII.] Introductory. 9\nnaturally held the pencil in the same way when trying to\nget automatic writing. Now, however, in obedience to the\nimpulse, I took the pencil between my thumb and first finger,\nand after a few nonsense-words it wrote rapidly in Latin.\nI was writing in the dark and could not see what I wrote ;\nthe words came to me as single things, and I was so much\noccupied in recording each as it came that I had not any\ngeneral notion of what the meaning was. I could never\nremember the last word; it seemed to vanish completely as\nsoon as I had written it. Sometimes I had great difficulty\nin recognising what was the word I wanted to write, while at\nother times I could only get part of it. When I had filled\none sheet of paper, I turned up the electric light and read\nwhat had been written before going on to the next sheet.\nOn this first occasion, March 5, 1901, my hand wrote about\n80 words almost entirely in Latin, but though the words are\nconsec!itive and seem to make phrases, and though some of\nthe phrases seem intelligible, there is no general Sense in the\npassage.1\nTill the end of the month, with a very few exceptions, I con\ntinued daily to write fluently in Latin, with occasional Greek\nwords. The writing was not intelligible throughout, but it\nimproved and was very different from the mere rubbish with\nwhich it began. Whole phrases were intelligible, and in spite\nof blunders of every description the general drift was often\neasily apparent. The actual writing was my own normal\nhandwriting and the amount produced at each sitting remained\nabout what it had been on the first occasion. I continued to\nuse paper of the same size and the script usually filled one page,\nthat is, it consisted of from 70 to 90 words, but occasionally the\nimpulse to write continued after the page was full and I then\ntook a second piece of paper. The end of the impulse to write\nwas often signalised by the drawing of a long line. After the\nfirst two or three times of writing I never read what had been\nwritten till the end, and though I continued to be aware of the\n1 See App., p. 340, for copy of early script. I have printed the\nwhole of the script of March 1901 to enable the reader to form some\nidea of the development of the script, and for the same reason I\nhave also printed without selection the script of March 1902 and\n1903. There was no script in March 1904.\n\f10 Chapter I. [PART\nparticular word, or perhaps two words, that I was writing, I\nstill retained no recollection of what I had just written and\nno general notion as to the meaning of the whole.\nAppearance of English.\nOn March 31 occurred the first intelligent use of English,\nnamely the word \" Remember \" in peculiar and separated letters,\nfollowed by \" A. V. E. vale,\" at the termination of the script ;\non April 3 the script ended ; \" God a Dieu Good be 'ye\nTuus \" ; and on April 1 6 a remark in English was interpolated\nin the midst of the Latin. From that time onward English has\nappeared and continues to appear quite as frequently as Latin :\nwhile there has been a good deal of Greek also from time to\ntime. Speaking generally, these three languages are the only\nlanguages used, though occasional words from others are to be\nfound. Attempts to give facts are in the later script usually made\nin English, Latin being used for the frequent exhortations or con\nsolatory and encouraging remarks that seem to be addressed\npersonally to me. But this is not invariably the case ; state\nments of fact apparently intended for verification being some\ntimes made in Latin, or in Greek.\nNumber of writings.\nThe automatic script has continued to be produced from\nMarch 1901 till the present time, with occasional intervals,\nmainly due to lack of opportunity or inclination on my part.\nIn this paper I discuss and classify the script obtained in the\ncourse of the years 1901-1904. I began an examination and\nanalysis of the script for the purpose of this paper in the\nyear 1904, and the last day of that year seemed conveniently\nto terminate the period covered by what is here discussed.\nBetween March 5, 1901, and Dec. 31, 1904, I have had\n306 pieces of automatic script written under the conditions\nabove described, besides 16 pieces obtained under somewhat\ndifferent conditions. These 16 were written at hours appointed\nbeforehand, and by arrangement with other persons who\nagreed to try at the same time for automatic writing. They\nare not included in the 306, though it may be convenient\nto refer to them in the course of the paper. The 306\n\fmi.] Introductory. 11\npieces,1 extending over a period of 3 years and 10 months, were\nnot produced at regular intervals. Generally speaking, my inten\ntion has heen to try for writing about twice a week, but some\ntimes I have been too much occupied with other matters to\nmake the necessary effort ; sometimes the writing itself has\nsuggested that I should leave off for a time ; or I have felt\ndisposed to wait without quite knowing why. On the other\nhand, I have occasionally felt desirous of writing more frequently\nthan twice a week, or I have deliberately resolved beforehand to\ntry the experiment of writing on several consecutive days. The\nhighest number of writings in any one month was 16 in March\n1901; 10, 11, or 12 pieces per month were obtained nine times;\n2 or 3 pieces per month six times, while in one month, March\n1904, no attempt was made. In December .1901 I wrote on\nfour consecutive days and then, after an interval of three days,\non six consecutive days. The longest intermission was from\nFebruary 15 to April 9, 1904. Sometimes, but rarely, I have\nwritten twice in one day. I have not been able to distinguish\nany difference in results whatever methods were employed.\nSince the beginning of the writing I have never failed to pro\nduce something when I have sat down to write, but occasionally\nit has only been half-a-dozen words.\nRecord and Preservation.\nThe method of record and preservation has been as follows :\nUp to the middle of December 1902 I myself kept the original\nwritings, in pencil and for the most part on large sheets of\npaper. But on and after Dec. 14, 1902, the originals, after\nbeing copied, have been sent to Sir Oliver Lodge one by one,\nas they have been obtained, in envelopes which he has filed\nand kept unopened unless specially requested. The earlier\noriginals were also sent to him in December, 1902. From\nthe beginning, each original writing has been copied by me\ninto a note-book kept for the purpose in which the date of\nthe copy as well as of the original is entered.2 During the first\n1 See App., p. 354, for dates of writings.\n2 In this book are also entered dated notes of all information bearing\non the script, such as verifications, refutations, possible explanations,\nand so on.\n\fi\u00a3 , Chapter I. [PART\nfew months each piece of writing was seen by my husband\nalways within a few hours of its production, and often\nimmediately on its termination, but since the sending of the\noriginals to Sir Oliver Lodge the script has not been regularly\nshown to my husband.1\nSensations while - writing.\nI have already described the conditions and the sensations\nwhich accompanied the earlier writings, and need only add that\nfor the most part the same conditions and sensations continue\nto prevail. Whether I write in light or dark, I do not look\nat the paper. I perceive a word or two, but never under\nstand whether it makes sense with what goes before.\nUnder these circumstances, it will be seen that though I am\naware at the moment of writing what language my hand is\nusing, when the script is finished I often cannot say, till I read\nit, what language has been used, as the recollection of the words\npasses away with extreme rapidity.\nI have tried more than once to reproduce from memory\nwhat has just been written, but I have never been able to\ngive more than a word or two and I have no impression\nas to the general sense, if there has been any. The only\nsuccessful attempt at reproduction was obtained under the\nfollowing circumstances : I had written automatically imme\ndiately before sleeping, and I did not read it over. The\nnext morning I tried to remember it, and wrote down all\nI could. The script (Aug. 25, 1902) consisted of 27 Latin\nwords followed by 83 English words, and a signature.2 My\neye had fallen on the first three words before it occurred to\nme to make the experiment, and my reproduction was as\nfollows : \" quantula pars rogationis\u2014Latin first about 3 or 4\nlines. then children and a mossy-something in a forest, write\nto-morrow.\" I was quite unable to remember whether there\nwas a signature. What I did remember was correct as far\nas it went, but the reader will see that it did not go far. This\n1In May 1906, the originals were taken by Sir Oliver Lodge to the\nRooms of the S.P.R., where, under my directions, they were compared\nwith the copies for the purposes of this paper.\n2 See App., p. 355.\n\fLin.] Introductory. 13\npiece of script was more intelligible and connected than many\nof the , productions, so that it might have been expected that\nI should have had a better recollection of it. On other occasions,\nwhen I have written down at once what I could remember,\nonly the last word or two has ever been recalled.\nI usually write when I am alone, and. I prefer not to have\na bright light ; it is desirable also to write at a time of day\nor under circumstances when I am not likely to be interrupted.\nBut none of these conditions is essential. I write freely with\nmy husband in the room ; I have also written with my daughter\nwatching me, and with a servant moving about in the room ;\non five occasions (July 30, 1901, Dec. 9, 1902, April 26, 1903,\nMay 11 and 13, 1904) I have tried to obtain writing in\npresence of other friends, each, time with success, though the\namount has been less than usual ; it is quite common for me\nto write in a railway carriage with other travellers present ;\nand it has happened to me several times to be momentarily\ninterrupted, to answer a question briefly, and to continue writing.\nOn 21 occasions out of the whole 306, I have had a sudden\nimpulse to write, and twice after finishing, as I thought, the\nparticular bit of writing, I have had a strong impulse to con\ntinue (Nov. 25, 1901, July 31, 1903). On some of these\noccasions the writing obtained in obedience to such an impulse\nhas seemed specially interesting, but that is by no means\ninvariably the case.1 Sometimes the impulse to write takes\nthe . form of discomfort in the right arm or hand, but this is\nrare; I have only noted three occasions (March 8, 1901, Jan.\n8, 1902, April 14, 1902), and on one of these I was prevented\nby circumstances from writing at once. My left hand writes\nautomatically as well as my right ; I should say that I normally\ncan write with both hands, and use the left when the right is\nincapacitated by writer's cramp.\nOn one occasion (April 19, 1901) I had a feeling some\nlittle time before the actual writing came 2 that I might want\nto write, and this induced me to buy a paper that I might\nhave a support to write on, as I was just going by train; but\nit was not until some 50 minutes after the train started that\n10f these 21 pieces of script written under sudden impulse, 6\nappear to contain matter of interest.\n2 See p. 149.\n.\n\f14 Chapter I. [PART\nI had any desire to write, in spite of the expectation aroused\nby the previous feeling. Another time (May 27, 1901) I had\na curious sense of \" expectancy and subdued excitement as if\nsomething were going to happen,\" and I noted the sensation\nat the time, 10.15 a.m. I also noted that I had no desire\nto write automatically. But at 12.40 p.m. on the same day,\nI had a sudden impulse to write when I was otherwise\nengaged. The writing described the burning of a house and\nthe arrival on the scene of a fire engine. It is possible, I\nsuppose, that the same cause\u2014whatever it may have been\u2014\nthat produced the script had produced the earlier feeling of\nexcitement.1\nOne other sensation occasionally accompanies the script, and\nhas perhaps tended to increase. I am sometimes exceedingly\nsleepy during the production of the writing, and more than\nonce I have momentarily lost consciousness of my surroundings.\nThe first time that this happened I was writing by firelight\nwith my eyes shut, as I often do, and got very sleepy, so\nsleepy that when the pencil ceased to write and I turned up\nthe light I could not understand a word of what I saw, and\nlying down on the sofa actually went to sleep till a noise\nroused me. The writing (Feb. 13, 1902) presented no points\nof interest, but perhaps suggests that more than one influence 2\nor set of associations is discernible in the writing.\nThe next occasion on which this feeling of sleepiness occurred\nwas on November 24, 1902, and it was then more marked. I\ncopy the contemporary note : \" I got very sleepy and lost con\nsciousness, I think, in the middle : the writing was very violent\nwhen I again realised what I was doing and more ' automatic '\nthan usual.\" Here, too, as in the earlier case, there purport\nto be more communicators than one, and there are certainly\ndifferences of handwriting. When this writing was over, I was\n1 Possibly the account of the fire was an attempt, not very successful,\nto relate an incident capable of verification ; see p. 284.\n2 It is not easy to describe the writing without seeming to assume a\npersonality on the part of the supposed writer, of which I am very\nfar from being convinced. But it is convenient to use such expres\nsions as \"the supposed writer,\" \"the control,\" or \"the scribe to\nrepresent the motive power which seems to the owner of the writing\nhand something quite separate from his normal personality.\n\fLin.] Introductory. 15\nleft with a feeling of fatigue, and some discomfort in the right\narm ; I mention this as it is the only occasion on which\nanything like a disagreeable feeling was associated with the\nproduction of the script.\nThe next time that I went to sleep was in the middle of\nwriting on Feb. 23, 1903, at 6.15. p.m., when I had arranged\nwith two friends that they should sit with a Planchette at\nthe same hour. I slept only for a moment, and when I woke\nwent on with the automatic writing just as before. The words\nthen written were : \" It has helped them and you will get a\nmessage now plain to read.\" This latter statement was correct :\na message written by their Planchette was perfectly intelligible\nto me, and introduced names quite unknown to the Planchette\nwriters.1\nTwo occasions (March 11, 1903, and March 26, 1903) on\nwhich I was writing automatically the last thing at night and,\nfalling asleep, ceased to write, demand no comment. Three\ntimes I have gone to sleep towards the end of the writing\n(July 21, 1903, Sept. 27, 1903, and Nov. 23, 1903), but\nwhether the last part of the writing was written before or\nafter I went to sleep I am unable to say, as I was alone in\nthe room. Once, however, on May 11, 1904, I certainly\ncontinued writing during my sleep ; I was interrupted by an\nunexpected visitor who found me writing. The hand-writing\nof the script thus produced is not my own, but bears a likeness\nto that of Dr. Sidgwick.2\nInfluence of contents on the writer.\nIt has occasionally seemed as if I were affected by the\ncontents of the script, although I was not conscious of those\ncontents. Thus once (June 10, 1904) I found the tears\nrunning down my face when the writing was over ; the\ncontents apparently alluded to two friends of mine who had\ndied under tragic circumstances. On another occasion (April\n24, 1903), when the script was suddenly stopped by an\ninterruption from outside, my left hand, which was not writing,\nwas very cold and I had a recollection of feeling a wind on my\nleft side ; just before the interruption there occurred in the script\n!See p. 250. 2See p. 26.\n-\n\f16 Chapter 1. [PART\nthe words \"a cold breeze blows.\" I have said that only once has\nany disagreeable sensation attached to the production of the\nscript, but I may add that if I am suddenly interrupted while\nwriting the sensation is not pleasant. Although I am appar\nently in a perfectly normal condition when writing\u2014for the\nnumber of times above noted when I have felt sleepy is\ninsignificant compared with the total number of times when\nI have written without feeling sleepy\u2014if I am unexpectedly\ninterrupted, I have a sensation of discomfort and a little\ndifficulty in adjusting myself to my surroundings, but perhaps\nno more than I always have if interrupted in something\nthat has absorbed my attention.\nExperiments on conditions of writing.\nI have made a small number of experiments in connexion\nwith the script which, for the sake of completeness, may be\nmentioned here, though it will be convenient to deal with\nthem under other heads later on. On five occasions\u2014besides\nthose mentioned on p. 10 and not included in this paper\u2014I\nhave tried to obtain writing at a time when some one else 1\nwas also \" sitting \" ; viz. twice with Mrs. Forbes and a friend\nusing Planchette (Feb. 22 and 23, 1903), twice with another\nfriend, Mrs. Dew Smith, who was sitting for tilts or writing\n(April 10 and 27, 1903), and once at the suggestion of Mrs.\nThompson (April 22, 1903). On four out of these five occasions\nit seemed that there was some interest in the results.2 Twice, in\nthe early days (March 14 and 15, 1901), in accordance with\nthe suggestion of a professional medium,3 I held in the hand\nthat was not writing, a letter from a dead friend, but no\n1 I have purposely not stated whether names used in this paper are\nactual or invented by me ; but wherever pseudonyms have been em\nployed, the real names have been communicated to the Editor of the\nProceedings of the Society for Psychical Research.\n2 See pp. 173, 209, 250.\n3 The medium in question, who did not know my name, had on\nMarch 8, 1901, said that I was an automatic writer, and later in\nthe sitting, on being given a letter from a dead friend of mine\nin an envelope, she said that to hold this letter would help the\nautomatic writing ; she was completely wrong in her description of\nthe writer of the letter, but I thought the experiment suggested\nmight be worth trying.\n\fLIII.] Introductory. 17\neffect whatever was produced. Again, at the suggestion of\na stranger, Mr. Constable, who had read the account of my\nexperiences in the S. P. R. Journal, I tried to obtain an\nanswer to a question contained in a sealed envelope which\nhe sent to me through Miss Johnson. It is possible that some\nof the references in the script written under these circumstances\n(Nov, 4, 5, 7, 11, 18 and 24, 1902) had some bearing on\nthe thoughts of Mr. Constable, but no answer to the question\nin the envelope was obtained.1\nOne other series of experiments concludes the list. On ten\noccasions I purposely concentrated my thoughts upon a par\nticular subject, recorded at the time, during the last fifteen\nor twenty minutes before trying to write. Four times (Oct.\n27 and 31, Nov. 3, 1902, and Jan. 18, 1903) while sitting in\nthe dark and alone, I concentrated my attention on a particular\nperson; once (Nov. 11, 1902) I sat alone and in the dark think\ning of the letter which I held in my hand (Mr. Constable's ;\nsee above); five times (Nov. 28, 1902; Jan. 25, Feb. 2,\nFeb. 9, Feb. 12, 1903) I spent the last ten minutes or more\nin reading or thinking over a passage from a particular book\nwhich had appeared to be referred to by another automatic\nwriter. The results are dealt with in detail elsewhere : as far\nas I can judge the resulting script presented points of interest\nin three or perhaps more of the ten experiments. They were\nanyhow worth trying, as in my opinion results of considerable\ninterest and value were produced upon the writing of the other\nautomatist in at least two instances.2\n!See p. 168. 2See pp. 239, 243.\n\f18 Chapter II. [PART\nCHAPTER II.\nFORM AND STYLE or THE SCRIPT.\nI NOW come to the main subject of this paper, the account\nof the writing itself\u2014its appearance and contents. It is\nnot easy to present this in a compact and clear way to the\nreader, and, as stated above, no exact system of classification\nseems possible. But I have grouped the miscellaneous mass\nof details under heads as far as possible and a rough order\nmay be observed in the treatment. Thus, a line may be\ndrawn separating such incidents as are capable of verification,\nor at least.- of explanation, from the more general topics, and\namong these last there are some which refer more especially\nto the form, and others to the contents of the writings. I\npropose to deal first with the general topics, leaving the dis\ncussion of particular incidents till the reader has gained some\nidea of the nature of the script, and in the general account I\nshall begin .with such subjects as concern rather the form\nthan the matter, though the distinction is not always easy to\ndraw, and in some cases a different classification might be\nmade. But such things as drawings in the script, its language\nand phraseology, its tricks of style and so on, seem to belong\nto the former category ; while the sentiments of the supposed\nwriter, the philosophical disquisitions and allusions, and the\ndescriptions of scenes may be classified as contents.\nI begin, then, with the form and style of the writing.\n(1) LENGTH OF SEPARATE COMMUNICATIONS.\nI have already said that the number of words written\nat a sitting varies from 70 to 90, but this statement is\nnot universally true. Once 265 words were written, in a\ndetailed description of a scene which has not been identified,\nand once only 20 words were produced although there was no\ninterruption. But, normally, the writing tends to stop when\n\fLiu.] Form and Style of Script. 19\none page has been filled, though the spacing of the words\nvaries considerably, as does the size of the writing. The\ntime occupied in each communication1 is about twenty minutes.\n(2) DRAWINGS.\nThere is nothing in the script which deserves the name of\ndrawing ; I am no draughtswoman, and the script shares my\nincapacity. But there are a considerable number of scrawls,2\nwhich are not letters, and for which I can find no other name\nbut drawings. Sometimes they are used to illustrate the text,\nas when after a description of a jewelled cross a representation\nof the cross is given (June 24, 1902).3 Sometimes the scribe\nexpresses a desire to draw, as \" the stone like this\" followed by a\nrough sketch (June 24, 1902,a); or \"now for the ring\u2014draw it\"\nand then follows a rough sketch of the stone set in the ring\n(June 24, 1902,6). Sometimes the drawing appears first, and\na description follows: on Nov. 1, 1901, there is a drawing of\na diamond or lozenge, followed by the words \" the lozenge\nis important.\"4 Not infrequently the object drawn seems to\nhave no connexion with the words of the script. Thus, on\nMarch 14, 1902, three shamrock-like objects were interpolated\nin the middle of some writing entirely disconnected with them,\nand on another occasion, September 18, 1901, an animal,\nprobably intended for a cat, appeared at the base of a writing\nwhich contains nothing to explain its appearance. The cat\nmade .a more effective entry on March 11, 1902,s though it\ncontributed nothing of value ; three drawings followed one\nanother, representing (1) a confused oval, (2) a sleeping cat\u2014\nobviously a development of No. 1\u2014and (3) a seated cat ; then\ncame the word \" watching,\" followed by the drawing of a\nmouse. Then was written: \"Nothing to day, wait for Hodgson's\n1 I use the word \" communication \" for convenience^ without\ndesiring to express any opinion as to the source or sources of the\nwriting. The script constantly assumes the form of a communication\nor message, and I shall use both these expressions freely, sans\nprejudice.\n2 These scrawls occur in about one out of every three pieces.\n3 For facsimiles see App. pp. 426, 7. ,\n4 Nothing has been made of the lozenge.\n5 For facsimile see App. p. 346.\n\f20 Chapter II. [PART\nnext letter that will make things clearer.\" Apparently here\nthe notion of waiting emerged first in the form of a cat\nwaiting to catch a mouse.\nWhat I have called drawings appear in 1081 out of the 306\npieces of writing. A common place for their occurrence is\nat the end of the communication as a sort of signature ;\n26 times a drawing appears in this place, and on 8 of\nthese occasions there is also a drawing in the text. Some of\nthese signatory drawings are of interest, and are discussed\nunder other heads.2\nFour times a rough drawing with no meaning replaces the\nfew words of nonsense\u2014sheer and absolute nonsense\u2014which\noften seem required before the script can get under way.3\nOn the whole I have not found that any value attaches\nto the drawings, and, except where they are introduced to\nexplain the writing, they usually occur in the more worthless\npieces. They are perhaps slightly more \" automatic \" than the\nwords, but unless they are simply an alternative rendering, so\nto speak, of an idea also expressed in words, I have no reason\nto suppose that they stand for anything more than the sort of\nfantastic picture or image which it is common for me to see\nin a crystal, and which has no interest or value of any kind.\nThe most elaborate piece of drawing occurred in the script of\nAug. 26, 1903, and, though elaborate, is apparently wholly\nvalueless. It suggests nothing to me, and I can in no way\naccount for the production of the greater part of it. The\nday before writing it I had been reading the H. Wedgwood\ncase quoted in Human Personality, Vol. II., p. 162 and foil.,\nand had noticed the crest of Colonel Gurwood, a reproduction\nof which is the first of the drawings in the script. The case\nwas not new to me.\n(3). HANDWRITING.\nNormal type.\nBy far the greater part of the script is written in my own\nhandwriting, altered slightly in character according to the speed\n!Qf this number, 108, not more than 78 pieces contain anything\nthat can be supposed to represent a definite object.\n2 See pp. 75-81. 3See p. 28.\n\fLIII.] Form and Style of Script. 21\nor size of the writing. I am not able to say whether the\npace of the writing is usually the same as that of my normal\nhand, as during the production of the script I am not sufficiently\naware of the manual act of writing, as distinguished from the\nmental effort to fix a more or less fleeting impression of the\nwords, to be able to express an opinion as to the actual time\nspent in putting things on paper. Sometimes I am aware that\nthe words are coming very fast, and the appearance of the\nwriting confirms the impression that the speed was consider\nable ; but much more often the whole process is slow, and I\nam unable to distinguish between slowness of apprehension and\nslowness of reproduction. At first it was usual for the whole\nof each contribution to be written consecutively in my own\nnormal hand, varied only at the conclusion by attempts at\nsignatures, or farewell words in a somewhat different character.\nBefore long a larger hand was used occasionally, apparently\nto draw attention to a word or to a change in the nature of\nthe matter conveyed : sometimes this purpose is effected by\nspacing\u2014the distances between words not always being uniform.\nStops are sometimes but not always inserted ; it is not un\ncommon to find a full stop marked only by the use of a capital\nletter for the beginning of the next sentence. But occasionally\nthe punctuation is extremely careful,\u2014commas, notes of interro\ngation, and even inverted commas being used. In the Greek\nwriting more often than not the accents are inserted, and the\nbreathings almost invariably ; but some of the Greek writing\nis very rough, and entirely without marks, or in uncials, or\neven in ordinary English letters for a word or two. It is\nnot uncommon for the transition from Latin into Greek to be\neffected through the medium of a word or two in Roman\ncharacter but Greek in form. Thus on June 27, 1901,\nthe script began : \" Quid coerces nenymon ya\\ijvwv pwwv,\"\nwith a little space between the last Latin and the first Greek\nword, and the accent only on the last Greek word. The\nrest of the script was in Latin till just at the end when\nEnglish appeared.\nUse of paragraphs.\nAfter a time the use of spacing was extended, and para\ngraphs occurred, noticeably on Sept. 20, 1901, when after\n-\n\f22 Chapter II. [PART\nsome attempts to give a word, the script began a fresh\nparagraph with the words \" The bird is nothing put it\naway.\" and then returned to its attempts to give a word.1\nThen a third paragraph began, \" Non possum plurima hodie- \"\nand continued with remarks on the difficulty of writing\nin Latin. The use of the paragraph has gradually increased,\nand now it is more common than not to have the contribution\ndivided into two or more parts by means of paragraphs.\nCapital letters.\nCapital letters first appeared on March 15, 1901, in a\nsupposed signature, viz. \" Pollux Cappa docus 2 ponet tigillum.\"\nCapitals are also used in efforts to give a particular\nword. In the persistent effort made during August and Sep\ntember 1901 to write a sentence that my husband, unknown\nto me, wished to have produced,3 the word \" Cock \" constantly\nappeared with a capital C, and other attempts to give the\nwords were often made entirely in capitals. The first verse\nthat appeared in the script was in Greek capitals ; it was\npart of a hexameter, the last word being spelled backwards.4\nThis is almost the only occasion on which any reversal either\nof the letters or of their order has been attempted. The\nabsence of \" looking-glass writing \" is marked.\nSize and variety of writing.\nThe writing is not always uniform in size, but varies a\nlittle as my normal writing does ; occasionally, however, a large\ncharacter seems to be introduced for some special object. This\nlarge character is in some cases just like what my normal\nhand would produce if I tried to write a large round hand,\nbut sometimes it presents slight differences. Sometimes how\never the handwriting is wholly unlike my normal hand.\nThe 18 cases of this large character may be thus summarised :\n(A) The script occasionally makes more or less persistent\nefforts to give some word or phrase, often quite unconnected\n1See App. p. 356.\n2 Where a space occurs between two words iu the script it is\nhere reproduced.\nsSee below, p. 156. 4See p. 64.\n\fLIII.] Form <ind Style of Script. 23\nwith the context, aud on five occasions uses the larger handwriting\nin such a case. Thus, the first appearance of this kind was\non Jan. 29, 1902, when without any connexion with what\nhad preceded, it wrote in a larger hand,1 \"gentile no\ngentes gens togata vocat,\" and went\non with further attempts to give some Latin phrase in the\nordinary hand.\n(B) Once certainly and perhaps twice2 the larger hand marked\nan apparently meaningless interpolation; thus on Feb. 12, 1903,\ncame in large type the words, \"And on. earth\npraise\" between a remark about \" Hodgson \" and a de\nscription of a locked box. , .\n(G) Twice the large type is used in what I have called a\n\"conversation\" reported by the script (April 3, 1901, May 31,\n1902).3\n(Z>) Seven times a considerable portion of the communication\nis written in this larger hand. Thus, on October 2&, 1901,\nan unverifiable message was so written, and on May 18, 1902,\na verifiable and partly correct message was so written.4\n(E) Twice a personal direction to me, in the midst of an\nattempt to convey a verifiable message, was conveyed in the\nlarge hand. Thus, on Nov. 25, 1901, after an attempt to\nproduce a verifiable handwriting, unknown to me,5 came the\nwords \"Leave your hand to m e.\"\nFour classes of different writing.\nWhere the handwriting seems to differ in type from my\nnormal hand the following classification may be made :\n(a) 3 cases where the writing is larger but also different in\ntype. These closely resemble the cases mentioned under (0)\nabove.6\n(b) 7 cases where the writing differs completely from my\nown, but does not challenge identification.\n(c) 10 cases where attention is called in the script to differ-\n,ence of writing.\n1 The spaced words represent the larger hand.\n2 On Jan. -25, 1903, the interpolation may not have been meaningless.\n\"See below, p. 68. *See p. 201. 5See p. 126.\n*For one of these, March 19th, 1902, see App. p. 348.\n\f24 Chapter II. [PART\n(d) 5 cases where a handwriting known to me is imitated,\nor where the writing is said to resemble that of a person\nindicated.\nSome only of these cases deserve comment. Thus, of the\ncases classed under (b), once (March 31, 1902) the unknown\nand evidently fantastic handwriting seems to comment on what\nhas appeared in the earlier communication, and to show a\nrecollection of my dreams not usual in the script.1\nOne of the longest communications not in my own hand\ncame on Feb. 18, 1902, and I have tried in vain to verify the\nstatements made in it or to discover its intention. After a\nremark in Latin to the effect that if only I would listen all\nwould be plain, suddenly in a distinctive handwriting, not\nthe least like my own, it went on : \" in this long narrow hand\nwritten two centuries ago or more. Can you not see who\nis meant ? Nevile is one name Ralph Nevile, not of Warwick\na scholar, not a soldier ; four square and pillars no other at\nall like it.\" Then in curious Latin, which I here translate : 2\n\" Dining at the king's table he there fell asleep. An unin-\nscribed slab covers his bones, from his ashes broke forth a\ngreat flame that created knowledge. This could certainly\nbe ascertained. The signatory set his name R. Nevile.\"\nThe Latin is odd and not classical ; the word commensal,\n\" sharing the table,\" occurs in no Latin known to me ; erupit,\n\" broke forth,\" is a correction for the word first written eripit,\n\" seized \" ; the verb \" to be known,\" a very familiar one, is\nmisspelt, scieri for stiri. The suggestion of the story is plain,\nbut recalls nothing to me. Some one, apparently Ralph Nevile,\nseems to have died suddenly after supping with his king, and\nto have received scant honour in his burying. I have failed\nto identify the Ralph Nevile described.\nAnother of these cases is described in detail below.3 The\nhandwriting of some words in the script of May 8, 1901,\nas noted at the time, is not mine ; it is not known to me\nand does not recall any writing that I know. I subsequently\nfound that very similar words had been spoken in trance by\na sensitive at a distant place and at approximately the same\n!For script see App. p. 349, and for comment see below, p. 153.\n2 The script is given in the Appendix p. 376. 3See p. 207.\n\fLIII.] Form and Style of Script. 25\nhour. It is possible that the difference of handwriting is\nintended to separate these words from the rest of the script, to\nserve, in fact, the purpose of quotation marks.\nIn one case, May 25, 1902, classified under (c), there seems\nto be an attempt in the script to reproduce not a handwriting\nbut a type of print in a book which it is trying to describe.\nThe paragraph is as follows : \" Maupertuis and Sarrasin\nnot the crop, these are names in a book together, a\nyellow book with clear good print early printed\u2014some one\nhas just read it in a library with slanting sunlight over\nlevel lawns outside the windows. a visitor to the house\nthe book is nearly square with a wide margin and black\nquaint print It lies open on a table Maupertuys\nand again in sainte amour et charite1\nbut the letters are narrower than yours.\"\nI have not been able to make anything of this, and can\nfind no connexion between Maupertuis and Sarrasin. It is\nnot likely that any book about either of these persons\nshould use the type or the language which the script tries to\nreproduce.\nIn seven other cases the script claims that the handwriting\nought to be recognised, but so far this has not been done. In\nthree of these cases it only remarks that the writing \" should\nhelp,\" or uses some such vague phrase, and does not say to whom\nit should be shown. In the other instances it specifies persons\nwho ought to recognise the hand, but these persons have not been\nable to throw any light on the subject.\nIn one case (April 27,190s)1 the script produced a very marked\nhandwriting quite unknown to me ; a writing which claimed to\nbe both described and imitated. As I was writing by arrange\nment at the same time as another friend, I sent her a copy of the\nscript and found not only that the contents of the message were\nin part intelligible to her, but that the handwriting resembled\nthat of a lady unknown to me, of whom she had been thinking\nin connexion with the subject of my message. I noted at the\ntime that my hand was cramped and uncomfortable at first and\nthe pencil slipped constantly till it seemed at last right. When\nthe unusual handwriting ceased, the pencil went back to its\nusual position.\n1 See p. 174, for further account of the incident.\n\f26 Chapter II. [PART\nThe cases where definite imitations were produced of hand\nwritings known to me, are as follows :\n(a) On Sept. 6, 1902, after the words, \"Wait for the clue\non the 17th it will come. Sept. 17th write then. Let him\nhave it to see and countersign,\" followed a passable imitation\nof Mr. Piddington's initials. To Mr. Piddingtpn, whose signa\nture was familiar to me, accordingly I sent the script to\n,\" countersign.\" 1\n{\/3) Mr. Myers.\nOn three occasions only has there been any attempt to\nreproduce the writing of Mr. Myers, a handwriting known to\nme and exceedingly characteristic. On Feb. 3, 1902, an attempt\nwas made to give words described as \" the test,\" but there was\nno indication of what was meant by the test; on Jan. 22, 1903,\na statement\u2014subsequently shown to be true\u2014about what would\nbe found in the forthcoming book Human Personality\" was made\nin a handwriting resembling that of Mr. Myers : and on July\n13, 1904, a statement in the same hand about the contents of\na sealed envelope said to have been left by Mr. Myers with Sir\nOliver Lodge was subsequently ascertained to be incorrect.\n{1y) Dr. Sidgwick.\nThere has only been one attempt to reproduce the writing of\nDr. Sidgwick, on May 11, 1904, when I was writing auto\nmatically at the rooms of the Society, 20 Hanover Square. I\nhad begun to write, by arrangement, with several other persons\nin the room, but feeling sleepy and not very comfortable in the\nroom with the others I went alone into the Library. There\nthe feeling of sleepiness increased and I knew nothing further\nuntil I was interrupted by the arrival of a visitor. The last\nwords written under these circumstances are in a hand re\nsembling that of Dr. Sidgwick, which was well known to me, as\nare also, though less so, some later words produced after the\ninterruption. The contents of the script, which claim to be\nverifiable, have not been found to have any meaning or appro\npriateness.\n(S) Mr. F. M. Balfour.\nOn Nov. 22 and 25, 1901, there was an attempt to imitate\nthe handwriting and the signature of the late Mr. Francis\n!Seep. 81. 2See below, .p. 315.\n\fLIU.] Form and Style of Script. 27\nMaitland Balfour. I was not acquainted with him and never\nsaw any writing of his except a message of three or four words\nwith his signature, and that I had not seen since July, 1882.\nOn referring to the scrap of writing it seemed to me that there\nwas some resemblance between the last part of the surname\nand the last of the three attempts at the signature in the\nscript of Nov. 25. Only the initials of the Christian names\nare on the paper written by Mr. Balfour, while the whole\nname is given in the script. I then sent the original of\nmy script to Mrs. Sidgwick that she might compare it with\nletters in her possession. She wrote to me that though there\nseemed to her to be a superficial likeness to Mr. Balfour's\nwriting, on comparison with his letters she found none in\ndetail. The contents of the script have not been found\nappropriate.\nBefore leaving the subject of imitated handwritings, I should\nperhaps say that I have normally no faculty whatever of\nreproducing handwritings. I cannot draw and I am a very\nclumsy copyist. Like all visualisers I have a very clear per\nception of handwritings that I have seen, and in thinking of\nthings written to me by friends I \" see \" them in the character\nistic writing. I should recognise a writing that I had once\nknown if I had not seen it for years. But my attempts to\ncopy and to reproduce from memory handwritings familiar to\nme have met with no success. I have no accurate or\nreproducible knowledge of the details of writings even very\nfamiliar, though by visualising a word I can often recall what\nkind of letter, e or r for instance, is made by a person whose\nwriting is well known to me.\n(4) INACCURACIES.\nThroughout the script is full of inaccuracies, sometimes of\na sort that might be made by any one writing rapidly, or\nnot looking at the paper, but often of a kind not paralleled\nin my normal writing. Of the mistakes in grammar and the\nvarious linguistic blunders in Latin and Greek, I shall later\nhave occasion to speak ; I am here referring to slight errors,\nslips, omissions of letters, and so on. These occur in all the\nthree languages, perhaps rather less frequently in the English\n-\u2022\n\f28 Chapter II. [PART\nthan in the ancient languages, and are constantly of a type that\nI should not have expected to find in any normal writing of\nmy own, however hasty. Dr. Leaf and Mr. Piddington appear\nas \" leaf and Pitherington \" ; Plato's Dialogue is called the\n\"simposium.\" \"Lith hill\" for \" Leith Hill,\" \"changs\" for\n\" hangs,\" perhaps belong to the class of printer's errors, as\ndo sprerare, equtum, solsituo, deii, pliana, for \"sperare, equitum,\nsolstitio, dei, plana,\" but the form diffitilissrimum for \" difficil-\nlimum\" is not one that I should expect under any circumstances\nto write in my own person. The same sort of error occurs\nin the Greek : thus avaSe^eirai, evidently meant as the future\ntense of avaSe^ofiiai, \" he will receive \" ; 6 craxfrpov, the masculine\narticle with the neuter form of the adjective ; and aoiSdi for\n\" poets.\" Such mistakes occur throughout, towards the end\nwhere on the whole the script is much more intelligible than\nit was at first, as well as at the beginning.\nI have looked through other normal writings of my own\nto see whether the type of error is the same as in the script,\nand as far as I can judge, the two chief errors to which I\nam normally liable seldom occur in the script. I am apt,\nas I suppose is the case with most people, to omit a letter\noccasionally, and a word often, but I can find few traces\nof this in the script ; it should, however, be remembered that\nwhen the general meaning of the sentence is obscure, it is\nnot easy to detect the unintentional omission of a word. But\nthe commonest source of error in my normal writing,\u2014one\nto which I have always been disposed, and which occurs in\ntype-written as well as in hand-written work,\u2014is the omission\nof the initial letter of a word ; this trick, which is charac\nteristic of my normal self, under conditions of fatigue or haste,\nseems to be wholly wanting in the automatic writer.\n(5) MEANINGLESS INTRODUCTORY PHRASES.\nIt is quite common for the first two or three words\nwritten on each occasion to have no connexion with the rest\nof the script; they seem to serve as a sort of start, while\nthe thing, whatever it is, is getting under way. It is seldom\nthat two or three unintelligible and disconnected words are\nfound, except at the beginnings. I illustrate these disconnected\nbeginnings by random selections from the script : \" Wensday\n\fLIII.] Form and Style of Script. 29\nCover dale and Dement,\" followed by an intelligible and\nconnected message (April 24, 1903); \" Polycept,\" followed by a\nmessage otherwise consecutive (March 17, 1903). A particularly\nclear piece of writing on Oct. 7, 1903, some of which was\nevidential, began with the words \" the Burnt Njal.\" I do\nnot mean to say that this introductory nonsense is usual, but\nit is common ; the number of times when nonsense of the kind\ndescribed prefaces a piece of script is out of all proportion\nto the total number of disconnected phrases in the script as\na whole. I have not, in fact, found any instances in the\nmiddle of the script of nonsense parallel to those just quoted.\nWhen a strange name or phrase occurs elsewhere than at the\nopening, an attempt is made to give some explanation of it ;\nas, for instance, on Sept. 28, 1901, the script had:\nAsharbal why cant you get it right? it sounds Indian,\nit is not\u2014 you can't hear it. Assharb all asher bell azure bell that's\nmore like.\nSeveral other cases of this kind are to be found, and\nsome of them occur at the beginning of a piece, e.g. on Feb.\n18, 1902, \" Cucurbito or Curculio neither is right\nCur non comprehendis ? \", but the meaningless introductory\nphrases to which I am here referring seem to have no context.\nA parallel is to be found in some experiments made by my\ndaughter and Mr. Bayfield in table tilting1 when it was\ncommon for the first few words to have no connexion with\nwhat followed, and often to be in a different language. In\nthe table tilting experiments this introductory rubbish often\nserved to prevent the sitters from following what was being\nproduced by the table, and we usually found the results\nbetter when the attention of the sitters had been distracted.\nPossibly some similar object is attained in the case of the\nautomatic writing by the production of a few words of sheer\nnonsense which serve to occupy the attention of the conscious\nself, and so leave the subliminal self more free to act.\n(6) TERMINAL PHRASES.\nCertain formulas have a tendency to come at the conclusion\n\u2022of a bit of writing, though in many other cases there is\n1 See Journal S.P.R., June, 1904.\n\f30 Chapter II. [PART\nnothing to indicate that a conclusion has been reached except\nthe cessation of the impulse to write. Sometimes a long line\nis drawn, and then nothing further is produced, even when I\nhave placed the pencil afresh on the paper and waited for\nsome time. Occasionally the concluding remark will be of\nthe nature of a farewell, as \" vale,\" \" no more now,\" and so\non. Often the communication terminates in the form of a\nletter : \" yours,\" \" tuus,\" followed by an attempt at a signa\nture; sometimes the signature is lacking and the script ends\nwith \" Tuus idem,\" or some similar formula. The question of\nthe signing of the communications seems to concern the nature\nof the contents of the script quite as much as its form\nand it is discussed below in connexion with the different\nforms (letters, reported conversations, etc.) assumed by the\ncommunications.1 Nothing at all parallel to the initiatory\nnonsense is to be found in the termination of the script. It\nis possible that the occurrence of a short formula, such as\n\" satis,\" \" iam satis,\" \" finis,\" serves, just as does the drawing\nof a line, or the affixing of quasi-signatures, to indicate to me\nthat the particular communication is complete, for, as I have\nsaid, I am almost always sufficiently conscious of what is\nbeing written to follow a word or two at a time.\n(7) LANGUAGES.\nLanguages used.\nAs already stated, English, Latin, and Greek are freely\nand apparently indifferently employed 2 for the communica\ntions, though possibly a careful analysis of the script might\nshow some connexion between the language used and the\ninformation conveyed. Of modern foreign languages there is\nhardly a traced In the very first piece of writing, quite unin\ntelligible (March 5, 1901), occurred, between two Latin words,\na German word, \" morgenstern,\" in ordinary character ; on\nApril 3, 1901, at the end of a Latin communication came\nthe phrase, \"God a Dieu,\" followed E by \"Good be 'ye\"\n1 See p. 73.\n2 But see below for possible distinctions in usage of these languages.\n\fLIII.] Form, and Style of Script. 31\nand the signature \" tuus \" ; not another word of either\nGerman or French1 is to be found in the whole of the 306\npieces. Italian occurs in two cases; on June 30, 1901, in\nthe midst of English comes : \" The bird will come 1'uccel di\nDio ; \" and on Nov. 5, 1902, there is an attempt, recognised\nby the script, to write Italian : \" Something says Italian words\nto-night, sempre cosi bene sta . it confuses. In tanto\ndiletto d'amor.\" This is, I think, easily accounted for. My\nhusband was giving a lecture to the Dante Society on the\nevening of Nov. 5, 1902, and we had been talking about\nthe subject of his lecture for some days, especially since\nNov. 3, when I had bought him the small copy of Dante\nwhich he was to take to the lecture. I was writing auto\nmatically at 6.30 p.m., and no doubt my mind was occupied\nwith the lecture which was to be delivered that evening.\nThere are other instances of the appearance in the script of\nsubjects which had recently interested me.2\nSetting aside then this last case which may be thus\naccounted for, there remain only the three instances just\ncited where modern foreign languages are found, and in no\ncase is any information given or statement made in them.\nAs regards my own acquaintance in this department, I should\nsay that without any accurate knowledge of Italian I read it\neasily, and have read modern Italian novels as well as Dante\nand Ariosto. I have at various times learnt a good deal of\nDante by heart, and many of his phrases come easily into\nmy mind at a very slight suggestion ; \" 1'uccel di Dio \" is\none which would be likely to occur to my normal mind at\nthe suggestion of a bird messenger. German I have known\nsince my childhood, though here again I am no scholar, but\nI have read it and spoken it from time to time for 35\nyears, and when I was first learning Greek I was constantly\nannoyed by the cropping up of German words while I was\nseeking for the Greek equivalents for English. French I\nknow well and read as easily as English ; I speak it also,\nirThe only references to French phrases are on Aug. 26, 1903, when\nthere occurs a French motto in connexion with a description of a coat\nof arms: arid on May 13, 1902, when the words \"fleur de luce\" are\nwritten in an English description of a coat of arms.\n2 See p. 139.\n\f32 Chapter II. [PART\nand indeed constantly dream in it, and speak it occasionally\nin sleep.1 In the imaginary conversations which I suppose\nmost of us hold with ourselves from time to time, I am\nquite as likely to use French as English.\nIt has always seemed to me one of the most unaccount\nable features of this automatic writing that French, which\nhas for me long and deep associations of familiarity and\nsentiment, should altogether fail to appear. I should cer\ntainly have expected to find traces of French in any expres\nsion of my profounder feelings. The complete absence of\nsuch traces is one of several indications that the subliminal\nstrata tapped, so to speak, in the automatic writings are\nnot those reached by the usual ways of dreaming or semi\nconscious thought.\nSo far as I am aware there is no trace of any other modern\nlanguage in the script. I know enough of Spanish to detect\nany attempts at it, but with the exceptions above named,\nand a very few unintelligible collections of letters, which\nseem rather to represent efforts to reproduce a sound than\nattempts at an unfamiliar language, the whole of the script\nis in English, Latin, or Greek. The English is perfectly\nnormal, as far as the vocabulary and phraseology is con\ncerned, and calls for no comment. But this is not the case\nwith the classical languages employed. The Latin and Greek\nof the script are at once more fluent and more faulty than my\nown ; the vocabulary is larger, embracing words unknown to\nme though often tolerably obvious in meaning and correctly\nformed ; the grammatical construction is less strict than in\nclassical writers, and, in the case of the Latin, the whole turn of\nthe phraseology is often medieval or at least very \" late \" ;\nthe mistakes are frequent, and often of a type quite unlikely\nto be made by myself; in fact, the suggestion, especially of\nthe Latin, is that the language used is one in which the\nwriter habitually expresses himself, and is certainly not the\nlanguage of the classical writers known to me. As this ques\ntion of language seems to be of interest, I shall deal with it\n1 I am not in the habit of speaking in my sleep, but when\nsuddenly roused from a dream I have found myself saying a\nword or two, and these are quite as likely to be in French as in\nEnglish.\n\fLIII.] Form and Style of Script. 33\nat some length, and will preface my remarks by a statement\nof my own acquaintance with both classical languages.\nAntecedent knowledge of Latin and Greek.\nFor something more than three years before February 1880,\nI worked steadily at both Latin and Greek, reading the usual\nclassical authors, and learning to \" compose \" in Greek and\nLatin prose and Greek iambic verse ; Latin verse I did not\nattempt. Since then I have been constantly occupied in\nreading and in teaching both languages, but up to the time\nwhen the automatic writing began, I had read very little\noutside the somewhat restricted range of \" classical \" authors.\nThe only exceptions were, in Greek, besides the Gospels, the\nMeditations of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, which I knew\nwell, and the Latin version of the De Imitatione, which\ncame into my hands long after I was intimately acquainted\nwith the English version, and which I read but discarded in\nfavour of the more familiar book. I have never read the\nVulgate, or any Latin prayers or hymns, nor till quite\nrecently 1 had I read any Christian, medieval, or Renaissance\nLatin writers, except a few pages of the Colloquies of Erasmus,\nwhen I was first learning Latin.\nI did not continue to practise writing either language for more\nthan a short time after the Tripos Examination in 1880, though\nI have had considerable experience in looking over elementary\nGreek and Latin prose, and some seven years ago worked\nthrough an elementary Latin verse composition-book with a\nview to teaching the rudiments. I have never been familiar\nenough with the art of composition in Greek to practise it for\npleasure, but there were a few weeks, twenty or more years\nago, when I was in the habit of writing little notes to a friend\nin Latin for the amusement of describing in classical epistolary\nstyle the common events of daily life.\nProportion and Intention of Latin and Greek in script.\nThe first 21 pieces of script are wholly in Latin, though an\noccasional word or phrase in Greek occurs ; in the next seven\n1 The dates of my reading of the Neo-Platonists and other late\nclassical writers are given when that subject is discussed. Allusions\nto Neo-Platonic phraseology in the script occurred before I read\nthose writers.\nC\n\f34 Chapter II. [PART\nthere are sentences in English, but the greater part is\nstill in Latin ; after that English begins to be freely used,\nbut Latin is by no means abandoned, being used in 186 of\nthe 306 bits of script. It has been less used in the later\nthan in the early writings ; it is found in 88 out of the\nfirst 100 pieces of writing, but the later percentage is not\nso high, and in the more recent writings the main portion\nis apt to be in English with only short remarks in Latin,\nthus reversing the earlier proportions. But, though it is now\nnot common for a whole communication to be in Latin, that\nlanguage still seems to be used as a relief, after a difficulty\nhas been experienced in saying something in English, as if\nthe Latin came more easily1 than any other language. This\nI suppose may be due to the fact that the first communications\ncame in Latin, so suggesting to my subliminal self that Latin\nis the best medium of communication. But this does not\nexplain why Latin was used for those first writings.\nFrom the time of its first appearance, on March 11, 1901,\nGreek has continued to appear in the script, but it does not\noccupy anything like so large a space as Latin. The pieces\nwhich contain it are fewer, and the remarks in Greek are\nshorter. Greek, in fact, does not appear to be regularly used\nlike the other two languages as a means of communication,\nbut rather in a special way. Out of the 306 pieces 113\ncontain Greek, and there seems no tendency to increase or\ndiminish its use; for it is found in 40 of the first 100 bits\nof writing, in 39 of the next hundred, and in 34 in the last\n106, thus showing only a small diminution, which may be\naccidental. There is no communication wholly in Greek. In\nmany cases Greek is used to convey philosophical or quasi-\nphilosophical sentiments ;2 it is also frequently used in messages\nreferring to symbolism connected with the Greek letter Sigma.\nAnother group of contributions in which Greek appears is that\nin which an effort was being made to give a sentence which\nwas the subject of an experiment of my husband's unknown to\nme ; as the words which he wished to convey were Greek, the\nappearance of Greek in the attempts to guess these words is\nI0u more than one occasion it is stated in the script that Latin\nis easier.\n2 See below, p. 125.\n\fLIII.] Form and Style of Script. 35\nprobably not accidental.1 In poetic or highly-coloured descrip\ntions in Latin, the script is very apt to break into Greek\nfor a word or two, and there are three or four attempts at\nGreek verse.2 On two occasions at least a statement which\nseems to have evidential value is given in Greek, once, on\nJan. 31, 1902, in that language combined with Latin. Speak\ning generally, then, it seems as if a reason could be given\nin many cases for the use of Greek, or at least as if the\ninstances where Greek was used could be classified without\nmuch difficulty.\nThis is by no means the case with the Latin. I am not\nable to make any distinction between the use of Latin and\nEnglish ; both are used for the personal remarks apparently\naddressed by way of encouragement or reproach to me,3 and\nalso for the communication of what are claimed as facts,\nwhether verifiable and verified or not. In the beginning\nEnglish seemed to be more often used for such statements.\nThus several attempts at a message about a pamphlet\nwhich was to be given to Mrs. Sidgwick came in\nEnglish in the midst of the Latin, which was at that time\nthe normal language of the script. On the other hand,\nthe first description of an incident capable of verification,\nand subsequently ascertained to be correct4 (May 11, 1901),\nwas in Latin. On the whole it may be said that for\nsome considerable time it was the habit of the script to\nbegin in Latin, and after some statements in English to con\nclude in Latiu, but this habit was constantly broken, and in the\nlater writings it is quite common for the process to be reversed.\nThe more poetical passages, including pieces resembling descrip\ntions of classical \" Isles of the Blest,\" are apt to be in Latin\nwhen they are not in Greek, though even here the rule is not of\nuniversal application, one of the most definite attempts to describe\nsome such place6 (Aug. 8, 1903), being in English, after a pre\nliminary start in Greek followed by three words in Latin,\nwhile another highly coloured description (May 29, 1903)\nwhich began in Latin went on to Greek, and after returning\nto Latin concluded in English.8 In fact it is difficult at\npresent to make any generalisation.\n1 See p. 156. 2 See p. 63. 3 See p. 88.\n* See p. 328. 5 See p. 117. \u00ab See p. 116.\n\f36 Chapter II [PART\nPhilological Peculiarities in Latin and Greek.\nAs I have already said, the vocabulary and phraseology\nas well as the grammatical construction of the ancient languages\nused in the script are not such as I should myself employ if I\nwere deliberately writing those languages. The following illus\ntrations are taken chiefly from Latin, as some of the peculiarities\nof the Greek seem to be due to the nature of the communica\ntions themselves ; where, for instance, the ideas conveyed are\nthose of the later Greek philosophers, it is natural that the\nlanguage used should be unfamiliar to the classical vocabulary.\nWords non-existent and unintelligible.\nA considerable number of words occur which are not extant,\nand the meaning of which is not obvious either from the\ncontext or the form. Many of these are probably pure inven\ntions, but some of them are used with a curious persistence\neven after investigation has shown that they have no\nexistence. To the class of pure rubbish belong no doubt\ncapricornatam,1 Arturocampus, texiculae, spargedulis, clargedula,\nelectryosunen. Roscidulo rore has a sort of meaning, but I can\nsee no reason for the pretty constant use of saepedulo for\nsaepe (often), other than a preference for diminutive forms,\nwhich is elsewhere manifested by the script. A certain mean-,\ning can be seen in the words caligraphus calligraphiam posuit,\nthough the \" good writer \" seems doubtful of his spelling, and\nthe signature which he appended after saying that it was for\nme to interpret, tu interpretare [sic] debes, and which consisted\nof a capital S and a spiral, was described in the odd words\nhelix vel helicemorphistikos\u2014Labyrinthikos vel involute, which\nseem to be various quaint and non-classical ways of saying\n\" curly.\"\nWords non-existent but intelligible.\nThe curious words produced by the script in its attempts\nto give three Greek words chosen by my husband for the\npurpose of experiment are discussed later.2 Other words\n1 This occurs near the beginning of a piece of script and may be\na meaningless introductory phrase, see above p. 28.\n2 See p. 156.\n\fLIII.] Form and Style of Script. 37\nunknown to any classical dictionary and inexplicable where\nthey stand, though not without suggestions of meaning, are\neterophil, monoecist, monoicus, \/mvija-iKaKos ; iniagwhordns seems to\nbe equivalent to magus ; hagiologus, a \" speaker of holy things,\"\nor more probably \" writer of histories of saints,\" is twice used,\nthe second passage showing an unmistakeable reminiscence of\nthe first. Thus on May 23, 1901, the script had:\nAccomplishment is better than success. Do you see 1 Note all\nyou get. The hour is important, agnus dei cum cruce eburneo. put\nit down. Manifold uses are there for us all. Dominans in ripa\nstetit hagiologus. Crede experto.*\nOn Dec. 4, 1902, the script began \"Manifold uses are there\nfor us all, look back at that hagiologus is an\nimportant word.\" But I can find no connexion between the\ntwo passages, and no sense in either. Another word pro\nduced after considerable effort is \/j.eyepyda-Tv\\ov (Feb. 2,\n1904), which I suppose might mean a \"large Labour prison,\"\nand seems from the context to have some such sense.\ne<pe\\icvcrTiKov is used apparently in the sense of \" dragged\nafter,\" a non-classical and I should think impossible sense.\nTrpocre\\\\rjvi^eiv is another odd word, which may be variously\ndivided and interpreted.1 e<nrepa\u00a3eiv, an impossible Greek\nword, which seems to be formed on a false analogy with\nthe Latin vesperasco, \" to grow evening,\" appears to be used\nin the sense \" to stay out in the evening.\" <riy\/j.aTOeiSes,^\nwhich first appeared as a^iy\/maroeiSes, is perfectly intelligible\nand regularly formed though it does not as a fact exist.\nWords used in special senses.\nIn some cases words of a vague or even an inappropriate\nmeaning appear to be used in some special sense. Such is the\nuse of mansuetudinem, \"gentleness,\" which on May 11, 1901,\nseems to be applied to some material object ; a paper is said\nto have been placed in a box and over it a mansuetudo\nwhich is to be lifted off. The word supellex, \"furniture,\" is\n* Trans. \" Lamb of God with cross of ivory. . . . Ruling on the\nshore stood the hagiologus. Believe one who knows.\"\nt Trans. \" Sigma shaped.\"\n17rp6s and \"EAX?jv or irpo and\n\f38 Chapter II. [PART\nconstantly used in a sense evidently thought by the script to\nbe quite definite ; it appears to be some piece of furniture\ncapable of containing an object, possibly a paper of importance.\nThus on May 31, 1901, after a reference to the passage\nin the Symposium,1 Diotima gave the clue, it goes on, Fascines\nvel fasces in supellectili, apparently meaning \" a bundle in a\npiece of furniture,\" adding that a happy thought is concealed in\nthe Latin tongue. On another occasion, March 2, 1902, the\nmysterious remark occurs Supellectilem ero cedo, \" I give the\nsupellex to its master (?),\" i.e. \" abandon it (?),\" and as the next\nremark tells me not to take useless things for useful, the sug\ngestion here may be that supellex, as occasionally in Latin, is\nused in a metaphorical sense, \" superfluities.\" But on October\n9, 1902, Purpur regale in samite odorificatum, \"scented purple\nin fine linen\" (or some such thing), is said to be in a supellex,\nand immediately afterwards follows what seems to be a trans\nlation, purple but not fine raiment lying in a chest, it gleams\nand a scent is there. But the word \" chest \" does not seem\nalways to fit supellex, and moreover there is an obvious word\nfor chest (cista), apparently not unknown to the script, as the\ndiminutive cistela (sic) is used. On Jan. 18, 1903, I am\ndirected (apparently) to lift up a supellex \"in the middle and\nfind what is underneath,\" Supellectilem in media leves quod\nsubter est invenies, and a few days later, Jan. 25, just before a\npassage unmistakeably referring to the quotation from the\nSymposium and also to a locked box, come the words, supellex\nis the nearest word, interpret that. Finally on March 17, 1903,\nafter speaking of a writing-table with a key in its drawer, the\nscript with some anger says that constant repetition is annoying,\nthat I am to take the key, and break the \" supellex \" if I can\nnot otherwise manage, Hxacerbat repetitio principii\u2014cape clavem.\nSupellectilem frange si aliter non posses.\nSo much for the use of the word supellex, which remains\nentirely unexplained. Another curious word which seems to\nbe connected with a missing or important paper is the word\nj-altela, to which I can attach no meaning at all. In form it\nseems to suggest a badly Latinised ' fauteuil,' but I can find\nno such word, and as ' fauteuil ' is apparently of German origin,\n' faldstuhl,' there is not likely to be any Latin word, such as\n1 See pp. 310-318.\n\fLIII.] Farm and Style of Script. 39\nfaltela, even in medieval Latin. The word occurs three times\nin the script. On April 14, 1901, something is said to have\nbeen placed in a faltela at Pratio's\u2014posuit quod volui in faltela\napud Prationem\u2014and as several attempts to give a ' test word '\nfollow this remark it seems as though a faltela were some\nthing that could contain a paper. On the next occasion it is\nconnected with the placing of a paper in a chest;1 after\nsaying that the removal of the mansuetvdo will reveal the\npaper, it adds Faltela inest, \" the faltela is inside.\" On\nMay 26, 1901, in a most unintelligible passage come the\nwords in faltela stat. recludere, \"it is in the faltela, open it.\"\nThese three passages of the script suggest that the word may\nbe intended to mean ' envelope,' but there seems no reason to\nsuppose that the word actually exists, and the language of\nthe script in these early days is so obscure that it is useless\nto attempt to interpret a word for which it is the sole\nauthority. On the other hand some of the early writings\nhave proved less irrelevant than seemed at first, so that I\nhave thought it worth while to collect together the passages\nwhere these unknown words are used, in the hope that some\nlight may appear where now all is darkness.\nThere are further a few cases of words apparently used in a\nspecial sense, though they have so many possible meanings\nthat it cannot be decided with certainty what is intended by\ntheir use in the script. For instance, repeated injunctions are\nto be found for the application of processes described as\ndestringere,\u2014nexere,\u2014superponere, to the words of the script ;\nin particular it is constantly urged that if some words were\ntaken, sume, and some process of superposition were then\napplied, superpone, sense would be seen where now there is\napparent nonsense. But no definite directions have ever been\ngiven as to this process of superposition, and the later writ\nings contain few references to it.\nUnusual Constructions.\nBesides the above described use of odd words the gram\nmatical construction presents peculiarities. The most noticeable\nof these is a frequent use of the infinitive instead of the\nimperative, a usage not unknown in classical Greek but rare,\n!See preceding page.\n\f40 Chapter II. [PART\nand not known as far as I am aware in classical Latin. Tu\nmodo patientiare is an odd way of saying in Latin, \" only be\npatient \" ; tempus adnotare appears the next day for \" note the\nhour.\" Nor should I have written -xpijcrOai \/movov va> crv\/m-\nTr\\acrereiv aei TCC oxrai\/Tw? S^OVTO, whatever I had meant to\nexpress. The imperative is also used by the script in\nboth languages, in Greek more often than the other construc\ntion, but in Latin it seems a matter of indifference which is\nemployed. Thus on June 23, 1901, roga in epistulis is followed\nalmost immediately by notare diem, and on Nov. 22, 1901,\nthe order is reversed : Hodie committere aliquid chartae turn\u2014\nrespice postero die tune interpretationem bene invenies. Here\nthe obvious intention is to give directions that (1) something\nis to be set on paper, and (2) that something on the paper is\nto be looked at, though whether the examination is to be now\nof something already written (look back at yesterday's) or is\nto be subsequently of what is now written (write to-day, look\nback next day) is uncertain. In any case there seems no\nreason for distinguishing between the two injunctions, and\nthroughout the script a careful study of both constructions\nhas not enabled me to discover any distinction in their use.\nNor has the irregular construction ceased to appear with the\ndevelopment of the writing; on June 8, 1904, it is used in\nwhat seems to be a prayer, 0 tu qui spem nostrum informa-sti,\npatientiam insuper praebere tuis tibi confitentibus, \" 0 thou who\ndidst give us hope, give patience also to those who trust in\nthee.\"\nCrabbed Style.\nAnother characteristic of the Latin is perhaps rather a\nquestion of style than syntax, and consists in a condensation\nand brevity which make interpretation difficult. This is more\nmarked in the earlier writings. In many of these cases I often\nfailed to see any sense at all, though other persons subsequently\ndiscovered a meaning which was then apparent to me. It is, I\nsuppose, possible that the crabbed style and obscurity may be\nuseful in disguising the intention from me during the act of\nwriting, and so giving a more free hand to the subliminal self.\nInstances of this crabbedness of construction are, on March\n14, 1901, consolator dux fidei nee unquam caret quotiens\n\fLIII.] Form and Style of Script. 41\ndiscerpitur placet ne ? There was 110 punctuation till the ?,\nbut the words were spaced as above represented. It may be\ninterpreted : \" The consoler is the guide to faith, and faith is not\nwanting, if the words are taken to pieces ; are you satisfied ? \"\nHad I wished to express such a sentiment I should have been\nincapable of putting it in such a form. Again, the following\nsentence, at first sight quite unintelligible, appears to have\na meaning, but is certainly not the way in which I can\nconceive myself expressing the idea : Communicatio prosit\nnecubiae necopinato ubi valetudo desit. This may mean,\n\" Communication may be of use unexpectedly in a sleepless\nnight when you are not well.\"\nAllusions to fables.\nSuch crabbed sentences occur much more frequently in the\nearlier writings, where also are to be found several curious\nphrases which seem to be allusions to fables or stories\naltogether unknown to me. For instance, on March 30, 1901,\ngrassulator petivit carnificem auribus istis non comprensus fabulam.\nI do not know what a grassulator is, and can only suppose\ncarnifex to be butcher. Who sought or hit the butcher I am\nunable to say, and so am in the same position as that of the\nperson, whoever it was, who with \"those ears of his(?)\" did\n\" not understand (?) the story.\" The next day there is again a\nperfectly unintelligible allusion to some \" smiling sisters,\"\nfollowed by the word Aesopi, which suggests that an acquaint\nance with Esop's fables might be of service, but I have\nnot been able to trace these ladies. On April 7, 1901, again,\nFaux cecinit griphoni gryllus manco (a phrase capable of trans\nlation if the third word is read as two, gripho ni,) seems\nhardly likely to have been produced by a fortuitous juxta\nposition of letters or sounds, but can only be interpreted by\nthe recognition of some allusion which escapes me\u2014\" The\nvoice speaks in a riddle if the cricket (or possibly ' little\npig ') did not speak to the maimed.\" Animals 1 play a\n1 For the bird which occurs frequently at first see below (p. 328),\nbut some of the allusions to animals preceded the successful hit\nwith the bird, which probably accounts for the later appearances\nof the avis.\n\f42 Chapter II. [PART\nconsiderable part in the early writings: on April 20, 1901, we\nhave alopex non sine vulture in Monte Citorio, pes manco, \" a\nfox and a vulture upon Monte Citorio a foot to the lame,\"\nanother allusion to the maimed of April 7 (above). This may\nmean that interpretation would be helped by the recognition\nof the fox and vulture on Monte Citorio. But I can make\nnothing of these animals. Bombyx in vacua, \" a silkworm in an\nempty space,\" on April 24, 1901, may be a description of the\nscript itself and its misplaced ingenuity, and is a modification, I\ntake it, of the phrase bombinans in vacuo, \" buzzing in a vacuum.\"\nPoetical Phraseology.\nA considerable list might be made of words or phrases in\nLatin or Greek which suggest poetical or literary associations\nthough they are not reproductions of classical expressions.\nSome of these occur in descriptions of glorified and unfamiliar\nscenery, which are discussed later, but it will be convenient to\ncomment on the actual oddities of phrase here. In some cases\nthese poetical or high-flown phrases occur in no connexion which\naccounts for them, and where they are of a type quite unlikely\nto be used by my normal self, I have noted them among philo\nlogical peculiarities. The first complete poetical phrase of this\ntype occurred on March 21, 1901 : mox adveniet lux chalcidica\ninviolabilis. It is not easy to translate this phrase, as the\nmeaning is conveyed by allusion rather than statement. The\n\" inviolate light of the Sibyl \" that will \" shortly come \" sug\ngests rather than says that I may look before long for a\nmeaning in the obscure utterances of the script. The reader\nmust take my word for it, that the rolling phrase with its\nfar-fetched allusion to Virgil's Sibyl,1 whose home was by the\n' Chalcidian height ' of Cumae, is not one that would occur to\nme naturally. So too on June 27, 1901, I was surprised to\nfind that my pencil had written \" Quid coerces nenymon yaXtjvwv\npwfjLrjv ; \" * and a little later in the same script \" velociter\ncurrit alatus pes, vehementior rota, ocissime autem nuntius\n* Trans. \"Why dost thou hold back the might of the windless\ncalms ? \"\n!See Virg. Aen. vi. 17, \" Chalcidicaque levis tandem super adstitit\narce.\"\n\fLIU.] Form and Style of Script. 43\ndei alipes super maria volitans.\" * The phrase vijve\/mwv ya\\r]vwv\nrecurs in the script, and seems to form part of an attempt\nto recall a passage in the Symposium? but there is nothing\nin that dialogue, or in any of the other classical passages\nwhere the phrase \" windless calm \" is found, to suggest the\nrest of the sentence as given in the script. Nor have I\nfound any parallel for this use of coerceo, \" to hold back,\"\nequivalent to the Greek Kare^eiv, nor does the Greek phrase\nKare-^eiv pdt\/mrjv occur in classical writers. The word alipes,\nthough intelligible, is not extant, and I know of no passage\nwhere a wheel is used as an emblem of speed ; a hoof or\na wing would be the more likely symbol before the days\nof railway trains, bicycles and motor cars.\nMore than one linguistic curiosity occurs at the conclusion\nof the script of May 16, 1902, this time all in Greek:\nMovcrcuos ]wixriK-g ^pf\/rai. eoTrepafeis, 5 Koprj ; KOI 8apdov<riv\ny\\av\u00a3 Kal avrrj <f>povSos r\/S1;. d\/i\/3po<rirj re vv\u00a3 \u00ab7ri apfiarl\nno a word wrong\u2014somewhere.

Ambrosial night is\nwandering on her car.\" There is more than a word wrong ;\nSapOova-i seems to be a false present for SapOdvovcri, and there is\nno authority for ecnrepd^eiv,3 but the general sense would seem\nto be as above. It is possible that SapOova-i * is a form of\nSpaOovcri, the dative of the aorist participle.t but no form\nexcept eSpaOov seems to have been in classical use. Both\nwords are poetical. The whole passage in fact suggests\npoetry rather than prose, but contains no reminiscence that\nI can trace of any particular Greek original.\n* Trans. \" Swiftly runs the winged foot, more violently the wheel,\nbut fastest of all the wing-footed messenger of the god flitting over\nthe seas.\"\nt Trans. \"There are hyacinths for the sleepers.\"\n!See p. 313.\n2 It is uncertain whether the original has <f>iory. or <f>oiry..\n3 See above, p. 37. 4Note that the word has no accent.\n\f44 Chapter II. [PART\nOn Jan. 18, 1903, in the description of a supposed \"Isle of\nthe Blest \" occurs the phrase Troy re evavde\/mw \" with fair flowered\ngrass.\" The phrase though intelligible is unfamiliar to me ;\nTroa is the regular word for grass or a meadow, other forms\nof the word being TTO'J^ and -jrola, but the form in the script,\nTrorj, does not seem to be used. evdvOe\/mos appears to be\ntwice used in classical writers ; by both Pindar and Meleager\nit is applied to the bloom of young manhood.\nA very curious expression occurs on Feb. 20, 1903, a\/ua-\npavOivov Sei\\ap, \" the bait of immortality.\" The common word\nfor bait is <$e\\eap, but Callimachus, I find, uses the form Sei\\ap\nin fragment 475. d\/mdpavOos means \"unfading,\" \"undying,\" and\nthe form used in the script is a perfectly possible one, though\nit does not as a fact exist. The combination of the two\nwords is entirely unknown to me.\nIn another passage occurs the phrase Kpva-raX\\oTrr]KToi vaycu,\nwhich apparently means \" frozen founts \" ; I have not found the\nphrase elsewhere, nor do the words for \" dark shore,\" O.KT>]\nKvdvey, used in the same script, occur in any Greek poetry\nknown to me, though they very well might.\nIn another place, Aug. 8, 1903, the original word ai5ro7n;\u00a3\noccurs, apparently meaning \" self-frozen \" or \" self-fixed.\" It is\nformed no doubt on the analogy of Kpva-TaX\\oTrrj\u00a3, an\nAeschylean word. The word Kpv\/TrdX\\ivov is used in the\nsame script, which represents an attempt at Greek iambic\nverse.\nOn July 3, 1903, a word is invented, SeSd-^erai, evidently\nintended to have the same meaning as SapSd-TTTeiv. It appar\nently forms part of a verse which is not given completely.1\nOriginal Non-Classical Phrases.\nAnother class of unusual expressions might be made con\nsisting of phrases intelligible as they stand, though not classical,\nand either invented or adapted for the purpose in hand.\nAmong these may be noticed the following :\n(1) On May 27, 1901, in an account of a fire given in\nmore fluent Latin than I should have had at command had\nI wished to describe such a scene, the arrival of the fire\nengine was described. This would have presented great diffi-\n!See below, p. 63.\n\fLIII.] Form and Style of Script. 45\nculties to me, and I suppose I should have said something\nabout a machina, or tried to find some sort of balista that\ncould throw water. But the script was bolder and wrote :\ntandem advenit fuscator magno equtum [sic] sonitu, \" at last\ncame the Darkener with a great sound of horsemen.\" The\nwords are plain enough, but not such, I think, as would\nhave occurred to any writer of normal Latin prose. The\nword fuscator is used in poetry, and once only ; it is\napplied by Lucan, Pharsalia, 4. 66, to the storm wind which\nbrings up the black clouds and darkens the blue sky. It\nwould certainly never have occurred to me to describe the\narrival of the galloping horses with the fire-engine in any\nsuch way as this.1\n(2) On Feb. 2, 1903, the script began with the words:\n\" Cunabula cum narthece ceromatico possidet infantem deum,\"\nand continued with phrases suggesting a liturgical fragment and\nceremonies appropriate to a non-Protestant ritual, or at least\nreminiscent of such a ritual. The general intention of the\npassage is elsewhere discussed 2 ; here we are concerned only\nwith the unusual words in the opening phrase. Cunabula\nevidently means a cradle, though there is no authority for the\nuse of the plural in this sense ; the script apparently thinks\ncunabula a feminine singular, but that may be simply a\nblunder. The words cum narthece ceromatico were completely\nunfamiliar to me, and suggested nothing till after consultation\nof dictionaries. Ceromaticus, an adjective formed from the\nnoun Ceroma, an unguent of which wax constitutes a part,\nis used, as I knew, by Juvenal (Sat. 3. 68), \" ceromatico\nfert niceteria collo,\" of the Greek wrestler who wears the\ncrown of victory on his anointed neck. Narthex I knew\nas the name of the hollow stalks in which Prometheus hid\nthe stolen sacred fire. Investigation showed that the word\nceromaticus is not used except by Juvenal, as quoted, and that\nthe word narthex is used of a case to contain something, and\nthe diminutive wirthecium is regularly used in late writers\nfor a doctor's phial. It is perfectly clear then that narthex\nceromaticus means a phial of unguent, but the exact phrase\nis not extant, and it is certain that had I wished to write\n1 See p. 284 for detailed account.\n2 See p. 120.\n\f46 Chapter II. [PART\nof a phial of unguent I should not have used either of the\nwords employed in the script.\n(3) Another example of the use of abnormal but intel\nligible Latin or Greek is to be found in a passage which\nseems to have an evidential value as showing a connexion\nbetween the communications of my script and those given in\nDr. Hodgson's sittings with Mrs. Piper. On Jan. 31, 1902,\nthe opening words were :\nPanopticon <r<fxupas driraXXei crwSey\/ia \/XIXTTIKOV.\nThe words may be rendered : \" The all-seeing (?) of a sphere\nfosters the mystic co-reception.\" Panopticon does not exist,\nbut its derivation is clear : it conveys the ideas of \" all-\nseeing \" ; ariraX\\eiv is a not very common word used by\nHomer, Pindar, and Theocritus, in the sense of \"cherish,\nfoster \" ; a-vvSeyfia certainly does not exist, though it is quite\nregularly formed, and its meaning is unmistakeable. Neither\nthe noun Sey\/ma nor the compound verb <rw8e^o\/j.ai occur in\nclassical writers, but there is no doubt as to the meaning\n\"joint reception.\"\nThe incident is related in detail below.1\n1 See p. 213.\n\fLIII.] Other General Characteristics. 47\nCHAPTER III.\nOTHER GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SCRIPT.\nI COME now to a class of topics which seem to concern both\nthe form and the matter of the script, and which may be\ndescribed as \"borderland cases\"; they fall under six heads\u2014\naphorisms, quotations, condensed expressions, assonances, puns,\nand verse. They appear to make a transition from illus\ntrations of the form of the script to illustrations of its\ncontents. There is a certain sense of appropriateness in some\nof the quotations and plays upon words, but on the other\nhand many of them seem to be used to fill in blanks between\nintentional statements, or to be due to some association of\nideas that has no connexion with the ostensible subject of\nthe communication. They are perhaps of the same type as\nthe \" automatisms \" 1 which Professor Hyslop has described in\nhis comments on the case of Mrs. Piper. In some cases the\nmeaning seems to be the more important part, in others the\nform of expression appears to be the determining cause of\ntheir introduction. The reader will best judge of their\ncharacteristics when the facts are before him.\n(I.) APHORISMS, PROVERBS, &c.\nThroughout the writings, but more especially at the beginning,\nare to be found what I have called aphorisms. In many\ncases these seem to be perverted proverbs, the sort of sentence\nthat one might make up in dreams, epigrammatic in form but\nwith little or no meaning on a closer examination. To this\nclass belong (May 23, 1901) \"Accomplishment is better\nthan success. Do you see?\"; (Sept. 7, 1901) \"Too many\nswallows and the summer is spoilt,\" which seems to be a\n1 See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XVI., p. 238.\n\f48 Chapter III. [PART\nhybrid recollection of two common proverbs with yet a kind\nof meaning behind it. On Jan. 8, 1902, a higher flight was\ntried : \" Never try with spun thread of your own fashioning\nto interpret the divine\u2014spindle. Lachesis will clip.\" This\nloftier vein still showed itself in the next piece of writing on\nJanuary 11, 1902, when I was told: \" Faith than Hope greater\nremoves mountains.\" This is analogous to the ' quotations '\nof the next section.1 The sententiousness of dreams,\u2014verbose\nenunciation of the commonplace\u2014appears on March 26, 1902,\nin the words, \" Not yet is the fulness of time\u2014reaping follows\nthe full sheaves,\" as also in the remark on the same subject\non March 19, 1902: \"Many harvests go to the fulfilment of\nthe crop of promise.\" The application of the proverb about\n\" pearls to the swine \" has a certain appropriateness where\nit occurs in an early writing, April 14, 1901, and perhaps\nis deliberately intended. It runs thus : margaritae vecriv tibi\nmeae forsitan sine pratio. Reading pretio for pratio the whole\nsentence may be rendered \" Pearls before swine, perhaps my\npearls seem valueless to you.\" 2 The other proverbial phrases\nabove quoted seem however to have no applicability to their\ncontext and occur apparently as spontaneous observations. Nor\nis it easy to see what is the point of the words3 dubium omne\nditbium, pro ignoto which precede a confused communication\non Sept. 6, 1902.\nThe opening words of Oct. 9, 1902, though cast in this\nmould, may yet be meant to convey a practical hint, \" Dreamers\nsee most of the truth\u2014in golden visions of the dawn.\" The\nscript is fond of insisti ig on the usefulness of sleep : \" Sleep\nis better,\" on May 13, 1903, gives the same idea, and it is\noften suggested that I should \" listen in sleep \" or leave off\nwriting now and sleep.4\nThe occurrence of these aphorisms is almost entirely confined\nto the earlier writings ; there has been only one in the last\n1 See p. 49.\n2 As my own name is Margaret, it is possible that some notion\nof a punning reference to that name has suggested the phrase.\n3 The phrase recurs in an inverted form on Jan. 14, 1903, \"omne\nignotum pro dubio\u2014in his atque in omnibus rebus,\" adds the\nscript.\n4 For connexion between script and dreams see below, p. 148.\n\fLiu.] Other General Characteristics. 49\ntwo years. On August 21, 1904, the script began: \" Econ\nEconomics Haste dictates what Wisdom shuns.\" The appli\ncation of the proverbial condemnation of haste to the subject\nof economics may be a reflexion of the general interest felt\nat the time in the Fiscal question. The rest of the writing\ndeals with wholly different subjects.1\n(II.) QUOTATIONS.\nThese are very much more frequent than the aphorisms. In\nthe whole number of writings, 306, I have found 75 phrases\nwhich are obvious reminiscences of passages in familiar authors.\nI have not included in this list one or two cases where a\ndefinite reference is made to a passage in some author as\nbeing contained, for instance, in a sealed envelope, or referred\nto in a book not read by me ; these are regarded as\nintentional remarks on the part of the scribe. What I now\ndiscuss is the appearance of familiar phrases, such as \"come\nunto these yellow sands \" or \" multum in parvo \" in the\nbody of the script, without apparent connexion with the\ncontext.\nA complete list of such quotations as I have recognised is\ngiven in the Appendix, with references in most cases to the\noriginal authors.2 It will be seen that the three languages\nhave been placed under contribution, but Latin furnishes far\nthe largest number, 48 being in Latin, 24 in English and\n3 in Greek. A point bearing on the question of language is\nthat the quotations occur with much greater frequency in the\nearlier than in the later writings, 35 coming in the first\n100 pieces, 26 in the second 100, and 14 in the last 106.\nIf the 22 quotations occurring in the first two months of the\nwriting (27 pieces of writing) are excluded, it will be seen that\nof the 53 quotations left, 26 are in Latin to 24 in English and\n3 in Greek, so that the predominance of Latin quotations seems\ndue to the disproportionate frequency of quotations in the\nearly days of the script.\n1 See App., p. 356, for complete list of aphorisms, which is not\nlarge.\n2 See App., pp. 357-360.\nD\n\f50 Chapter III. [PART\nIt will be remembered that the script became much more\nintelligible than it was at first, and similarly the early quota\ntions seem to have had little or no connexion with the\ncontext in which they appear, while in the later writings\nthe quotations are more intelligently applied. At the begin\nning they seem to be thrown out as if they were lumber of\nthe mind, bits of floating rubbish carried out with the stream\nat the opening of the sluices ; later on they are apparently\nintentional, and serve to illustrate a point or to suggest a\ndefinite image or line of thought.\nComment on Quotations.\nThe first few quotations have no meaning where they occur,\nbut are mainly very familiar phrases. They are certainly not\nwhat I should have consciously introduced, but there is\nnothing remarkable in finding, for instance, a reference to\nConstantine's motto,\u2014though the words would normally occur\nto me in Greek as they are said to have appeared to him,\nei\/ TOVTW V'IKO.,\u2014or to the familiar phrase \" o si sic omnes ! \"\nor again to the transitoriness of worldly fame, \" ubi nunc est\ngloria mundi.\" Horace's non omnis moriar, \" I shall not wholly\ndie,\" is almost inevitable under the circumstances, and so is\nAeneas' account of the change in the dead Hector who came\nto him in a dream, quantum mutatus db illo.\nOn March 14, 1901, in a piece of writing rather more\nintelligible than its predecessors, and containing the first of\nmany puns,1 came the words tandem, habes tota quod, mente\npetisti? \" At last, thou hast what thy whole heart desired.\"\nThe quotation appears in Mr. Myers' Presidential Address to\nthe S.P.R., delivered in May, 1900.3 The word tandem is\nnot in the original Virgil, but translates the words ' at last '\nimmediately preceding the quotation from Virgil in the Presi\ndential Address. It would therefore seem that the source for\nthe phrase in my script is a reminiscence not of Virgil but\nof Mr. Myers' Address.\nOne of two quotations on March 15, is optimo dierum,\niSee pp. 60, 280. 2 Virgil, Am. iv. 100.\n3 See Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XV., p. 114.\n\fLIU.] Other General Characteristics. 51\n\" best of days,\" an expression applied by Catullus to the\nchief day of the festival of the Saturnalia. The same phrase\nrecurs on April 3, 1901, where it is clearly intended to mean\nsome particular day. It is probable that the day intended\nis Sunday ; it is at least certain that on the Sunday\nfollowing the first reference to optima clierum, I had a\nvery strong desire1 to write, though the circumstances were\nnot such as had up to that point invariably accompanied the\nproduction of the script.2 Again, if optima dierum be taken\nto mean Sunday, the phrase of April 3, 1903, becomes intellig\nible. But, so far as I know, there is no reason to suppose that\nthe Latin words optimus dierum were ever used to represent\nSunday, nor when they first occurred in the script did they\nsuggest any meaning to me but the Saturnalia.\nThe quotation, \" Dianae sumus in fide,\" written on the above\ndescribed Sunday, March 17, immediately after the statement\nthat \" to-day I can probably do something,\" is also from\nCatullus, and perhaps confirms the notion that the vague sug\ngestion of a date on March 15 was meant to be Sunday. Here\ntoo something more intelligent than the mere citation of a\nstray tag of verse may have been intended ; for Mrs. Forbes'\nChristian name is Diana, and a few days later3 there appears\nin my script the first recognised attempt to set up a con\nnexion between her writing and mine.\nThere follow several quotations of no interest, and seeming\nto represent merely reminiscences of familiar formulas. In a\nreference to Tennyson, on June 23, 1901, for the first time the\nscript seems to be aware that an attempt is being made to\nquote, and apparently supposes that the quotation is appropriate.\nBut the allusion, if there is one, remains unidentified. On\nAugust 7, 1901, the quotation vile potdbis seems to be an\nattempt, recognised as a failure, to say something, for it is\nfollowed by the words \" that's not right,\" and further unsuc\ncessful attempts. The same may be said of Keats' phrase\n\"palely loitering\" on September 14, 1901.\n1 See below, p. 286, for a suggestion about the Saturnalia.\n2 I was not alone, and the hour was an unusual one ; see below,\np. 221.\n3 See p. 222.\n\f52 Chapter III. [PART\nTwice quotations are introduced with some apparent intelli\ngence, though they convey no meaning to me ; the script\nrecognises in one case (Dec. 5, 1901) that it is referring to\na Scotch Ballad, and in the other (March 26, 1902) that the\nquotation is or should be a help to interpretation, and on\nother occasions something similar seems to have occurred.\nA quotation from Browning on October 8, 1902, may have\nbeen an effort to produce something verifiable,1 for on the\nday when, on my way back from London, I wrote automati\ncally \" to the dark tower came who ? \" my husband had, during\nmy absence, and unknown to me, been reading Browning's\npoem \" Childe Roland to the dark tower came.\"\nSome of the later quotations are perfectly intelligible in their\ncontext, and bear no resemblance to the wholly inappropriate\ntags which occurred at first. On May 14, 1904, the opening\nwords of the myth in the Phaedrus are given and recognised\nas such by the script.2 Two other quotations are introduced\nappropriately; thus, on June 24, 1904, a disquisition on the\nattitude of mind towards an offender is preceded by the remark\nthat sometimes \" Saeva indignatio is just.\" On October 21,\n1904, a reference to the death of two sisters ends with an\nallusion to Horace's ode on the death of Quintilius.\nOf two quotations, which occurred on the same day, Oct. 23,\n1903, one seems to be of some interest in connexion with\nits context, and I here relate what I have been able to\nmake out about its meaning.\nOn Oct. 21 there had been written a fragmentary verse\nabout faith and hope, followed by a plain allusion to a pas\nsage in the Theaetetus of Plato, where Socrates says that there\nis no other beginning of wisdom but wonder, and that it is\nrightly said that Iris (the rainbow messenger of the gods)\nis the child of Thaumas (Wonder). On Oct. 23 another allu\nsion was made to the verse about faith and hope, and then\nafter the words \" let her write,\" the script went on :\nThese three are great, but greater than they is Wonder's daugh\nter. The stern Lawgiver is not so fair, Seek and ye shall,\nWisdom comes not unsought, and one comes to call who is not\nthere for the wishing. The child of wonder is a fairer figure and\n1 See p. 189. 2 See p. 145.\n\fLin.] Other General Characteristics. 53\na mightier than the rainbow of Hope,\u2014no messenger but the divine.\nBetter than Faith Hope and Charity is Wonder's child.\nIt was obvious at once that the writing of the 23rd\nalluded to the writing of two days before. The transition\nfrom \" faith and hope \" to \" Iris,\" not explained in the earlier\nscript, is made clear on the second occasion by the words\n\" rainbow of Hope \" which supply the connecting link. The\nintention of the second script is perfectly plain ; two points\nare made : (1) Great are Faith Hope and Charity, but greater\nstill is Wisdom ; (2) Wisdom must be sought.\nThe second of these points is made by the uncompleted\nreference to S. Matt. 7. 7 (or S. Luke 11. 9), and the words\nnext following. What at the time struck me as curious was\nthe sudden appearance in this context of the phrase from the\nGospels. The other phrases, \" child of wonder,\" \" daughter of\nwonder,\" \" rainbow of Hope,\" \" messenger,\" are Platonic,\ndefinite reminiscences of the Theaetetus, as was recognised by\nthe script of Oct. 21, and I knew no reason for their asso\nciation with the Gospel phrase.\nBut some little time later I found that the Gospel saying\nand the Platonic view that the beginning of Wisdom (or\nPhilosophy) is Wonder, have been closely associated by other\nminds, though this was entirely unknown to me when the\nscript was produced. I discovered it accidentally in the\nfollowing way :\nIn the Times of Nov. 14, 1903, I found an account of\none of the recently discovered Sayings of Jesiis, now published\nin the fourth volume of the Oxyrhyncus Papyri. Dr. Gren-\nfell had been lecturing in London on Nov. 13 (as also in\nCambridge on Nov. 10), and his translation of this \"logion\"\nwas thus given in the Times : \" Let not him that seeketh\ncease from his search until he find, and when he finds he\nshall wonder ; wondering he shall reach the kingdom (i.e. of\nheaven), and when he reaches the kingdom he shall have\nrest.\"\nI had not heard the lecture at Cambridge, but when I read\nthis report it struck me that there was a certain resemblance\nbetween its phrases and my recent script, and when the\nfourth volume of the Oxyrhyncus Papyri appeared, in May or\n\f54 Chapter III. [PART\nJune, 1904, I found that Clement of Alexandria had certainly\nconnected the Gospel saying with the Platonic phrase. In\nthe comment on the Saying (Ox. Pap., Vol. IV., p. 5), it is\nstated that the logion in question is twice quoted by Clement\nof Alexandria as from the Gospel according to the Hebrews,\non the first occasion to \"show that the beginning of philosophy\nis wonder \" ; and the logion itself is said to be parallel to\nMatt. 7. 7, \"Seek and ye shall find.\"\nIt may be that all this is irrelevant, and that my own\nknowledge was sufficient to account for the juxtaposition of\nthe Platonic and the Gospel passages, though I had never\nconsciously thought of any such connexion. But it is perhaps\nnoteworthy that the juxtaposition should have been made in\nthe script just before the occurrence of an opportunity of\nfinding an explanation of that combination of phrases which\nhad surprised me. I never had any knowledge of the\nmatter contained in the Logia till I read the report in the\nTimes of Dr. Grenfell's lecture, so that the words of the script\ncannot have been a reminiscence.1\nTo sum up then, it will be seen that the quotations are\nof two kinds : (1) mere tags introduced with no appropriate\nness, and (2) reminiscences apparently used deliberately, though\nthe purpose is not always ascertainable. The former class occur\nmainly in the earlier writings, and seem to approximate to the\n\" aphorisms \" of the script, and perhaps to the automatisms of\nProfessor Hyslop, while the latter are to be found in the later\nscript, which is on the whole fairly intelligible. The sources\nof the quotations call for no special comment ; the authors\nfrom whom they are derived are accessible and familiar ; but\nwith a few exceptions they are not the quotations most familiar\nto me, or such as would first occur to me were I asked for\na list of familiar quotations. The absence of French, prose\nor verse, is noticeable here as above ; were I to draw up a\nlist of the phrases constantly occurring to me in daily life,\nFrench literature would furnish a large portion of the\nwhole.2\n!See also p. 321.\n2 It was at some period in the early part of 1904, when analysing\nthe contents of the script, that I first noticed the absence of French\nphrases and allusions in the script.\n\fLIU.] Other General Characteristics. 55\n(III.) CONDENSED EXPRESSIONS.\nTt has happened occasionally that an unintelligible expression\nhas subsequently been expanded into words with a meaning, thus\nsuggesting that at the first attempt the idea has emerged in the\ncondensed fqrm called by ' Lewis Carroll ' a \" portmanteau.\" I\nhave found two instances of this, both in the early* script, and\nthere may be others unrecognised. On March 8, 1901, the word\ndbsolevisti appeared in a context which throws no light upon its\nmeaning : \" fac quaeras querimonium obsolevisti solacium dona-\nvisti etsi tu nescias.\" The sense is not determinable though,\nwith the exception of obsolevisti, the words have meaning : fac\nquaeras \" see that you ask (or seek),\" and querimonium, false form\nfor querimonia, \" complaint,\" precede the unknown word, and the\nsucceeding phrase means \" you have given consolation though you\ndid not know it.\" On March 11, 1901, occurred, without any\nexplanatory context, the words obsolevit iam ista oratio \" that\nkind of speaking is now obsolete,\" and it certainly seems as if\nobsolevit ista might be an expansion of the unintelligible word\nobsolevisti. In that case there would be a general sense in\nthe first extract. \" See that you search ; lamentation is out of\ndate ; you have unwittingly given consolation.\"\nThe next instance is clearer; on April 8, 1901, occurred the\nGreek phrase \/xeyaXoXXi\/ro? 6 KOUTK. The last words mean \" the\nbrother \" ; the first word is apparently a \" portmanteau \" of\n\/ueya?, \" great \" and o\\\\vrai, \" is destroyed.\" Not till nearly a\nyear afterwards, Feb. 10, 1902, was this portmanteau unpacked,\nand its contents were certainly not what I expected. I had\ntaken the first phrase to be an unsuccessful attempt to describe\ncomplete destruction, but the words of Feb. 10, 1902, were\nfjie<ya\\a>vvfiLOs o \/cu'cri? ov$e a7r6X\\VTai ra epya avrov, \" of great\nrenown is the brother, neither do his works perish,\" and there\nfollowed a description of some one whom I have not been able\nto identify. It looks as if the two words \/j.eyd\\a>w\/j.o<s and\naTTo'AAfTcu had first emerged in the impossible word \/meya-\nXoXXi\/ro?,\nIt does not seem possible to determine whether in these cases\nthe first appearance is a confused emergence, or the second an\nexpansion, of the underlying idea. If it is the latter, the\nincident is perhaps analogous to the development of the\n\f56 Chapter III. [PART\nnarration of an incident in the script, of which there have been\nfrequent examples.1 On the other hand, if the unintelligible\nwords are in fact unsuccessful attempts to write what sub\nsequently appears in a correct form and has always been\nintended, the error is not one of a type confined to my\nsubliminal self. It has happened to me more than once to\nrun two words together in conversation, though not I think in\nwriting, and to become aware only from a certain impression that\nmy hearers are amused that I have been using a ' portmanteau.'\nThus I have spoken of \"Jaesar\" where I intended to say\n\"Julius Caesar.\"\n(IV.) ASSONANCES.\nIn several cases there have occurred in the script juxtapositions\nof words for which there seems no reason but a similarity of\nsound. In some cases a pun is evidently intended, but in others\nthere is no apparent intention or meaning : one combination of\nsounds seems to suggest another similar effect, which thereupon is\nwritten. The actual puns are discussed in the next section ;\nhere I describe the assonances.\nThese sometimes occur in the midst of unintelligible words,\nsometimes again when the meaning, though not perfectly clear, is\nyet perceptible. I have found nine cases of such assonances,\nsome of them being very nearly actual puns. I have excluded\ncases where in the effort to give a particular word several similar\nsounds appear in succession, as those do not seem analogous to\nthe tricks of style with which I am now dealing.\nThe first of these assonances2 appeared on March 25, 1901,\nand has already been quoted.3 The sentence in which it occurs\nis perhaps intelligible, but the juxtaposition of two words so\nsimilar in sound as neculiae and necopinato can hardly be\naccidental ; Latin however lends itself to such assonances. On\nthe next occasion, March 31, 1901, the sound amb seems to\nhave been reproduced, but while the first word is appropriate\nin its context the two next phrases have no meaning. After\na remark that superposition would make all clear,4 the words\n1 See, for instance, the gradual development of the suggestion of a\nbook or paper to be found in a specified place, described on p. 195.\n2 For complete list see App., p. 360. 3See p. 41. 4See p. 39.\n\fLIII.] Other General Characteristics. 57\nare written : ambages desunt ava\/Salveiv necesse nee sine ambitu.\n\" There is no trick ; it is necessary to climb ; not without\nambition (?) \" It is easier to suppose that the similarity of\nsound has introduced the last two phrases than to find any\nconnexion between them, or with the first. On April 10,\n1901, a similar attempt to combine Greek and Latin words of\nlike sound resulted in absolute nonsense.1\nThe words on April 22, 1901, \u00a3rjT\u00ab Zyra prodest, \" Seek, Z\nis useful \" may have a glimmer of sense ; they come just after\nmy husband's initials, and at this time, unknown to me, he\nwanted my script to reproduce some words.\nOn June 30, 1901, in a piece of writing far more intelligible\nthan those just described the syllable del seems responsible for\nthe words Si]\\irrrjpiov SS\\TOV a\u00a7e\\<pos Se\\<f>iKfl which followed\none another, but when the fourth word was reached it was made\nthe beginning of an intelligible sentence, though whether this\nwas the original intention of the writer we may take leave to\ndoubt. The sentence \u00a7e\\<piKn a\/aipy ^pija-erai means \" he will\nuse the voice of the oracle \" and is appropriately followed by the\ninjunction to \" apply intelligence \" ingenium adhibe?\nA reminiscence of the preceding sound again probably accounts\nfor the words \" has long ago agone,\" which are found on Sept. 4,\n1901. There is perhaps more intelligence shown on Sept. 12,\nwhen, the intention being, as I believe, to add the Greek letter\nTT, p, (pronounced pi) to guesses already made,3 what was actually\nwritten was as follows: \" Thibet looks like a word, a tie between\nPye gives one clue, but there is another.\" There is, I\nthink, little doubt that Thibet and tie between are connected,\nand they may be unsuccessful shots at the sound Pi.\nThe next case, which should perhaps be classified as a\ndeliberate pun, also came when an attempt was being made\nto give a word. On Jan. 4, 1902, the script has:\nTell Hodgson the words in gen. that is nearly right yewr]a-is is\nimportant not Genesis\u2014and not Exodus but e\u00a3ySos\u2014Perhaps he\nwill understand that you will not.\nThe last remark if addressed to me was certainly justified ; I did\nnot understand. Nor do I think that there is any explanation\n1('Belua \/&AOS ebanuit.\" 2See also below, p. 288.\n3 See p. 156 for the full account of this incident.\n\f58 Chapter III. [PART\nof the extract except that the Greek yevv^erig, \" engendering,\"\nsuggested the much commoner word for \"creation,\" yevecris,\nGenesis, which in its turn led on to the second book of the Old\nTestament. By a reversal of the previous performance this is\nmade into e^uiSos, an unknown word\u2014an impossibility which\nmay have been perceived, and so saved us from the rest of the\nbooks of the Old Testament. It is conceivable that there was a\npoint in the \" words in gen,\" that the idea to be conveyed by\nthem was, for example, the idea of \" generation \" or birth. Dr.\nHodgson, on hearing of the attempt, wrote that they had a\npossible relevance 1 to him. But whether that be so or not,\nthe incident illustrates the tendency on the part of the script\nto produce assonances, without any further intention, as far\nas can be seen, than that of reproducing a sound that has\noccurred already.\nThat the association of ideas in the region reached by the\nscript is not that of the normal personality is further illus\ntrated by the last of this group of assonances. The incident\nneeds some preliminary explanation. In April 1902 I had a\nletter from Dr. Hodgson, in which he suggested an experiment\nfor me to try in connexion with his sittings with Mrs. Piper.\nThere had been some reason to think that there was a con\nnexion between her trance-writings and my automatic script,2\nand with a view to testing this Dr. Hodgson proposed that I\nshould look some morning at a noticeable group of flowers\nand try to get them mentioned to him in Mrs. Piper's trance.\nThere was a noticeable group in the room where I read his\nletter, daffodils and bay leaves, a combination never seen by\nme before, and I selected these. While I was looking at\nthem and thinking over the experiment, the phrase spissa\ncomam came into my head, \" close-leaved,\" probably suggested\nby the two Horatian phrases, spissa ramis laurea (Odes, n.\n15. 9), and spissa te nitidum coma3 (Odes, in. 19. 25). That\nwas on April 11, and on April 24 my script, after referring\nto Dr. Hodgson's experiment, wrote :\nIt is hard to do. Try again next week. Wordsworth's daffodils\n!See p. 282. 2See p. 213.\n3 The phrase spissa comam though recalling these two Horatian\nphrases conveys a new idea; Horace speaks of \"thick boughed\nlaurel\" and of a person whose \"thick hair shines.\"\n\fLIU.] Other General Characteristics. 59\nhe can get but not the spissa comam\u2014perhaps Daphne may help\u2014\nthe likeness of the words\u2014think of that.\nClearly this refers to the subject of this experiment, and is\nan attempt to make a word which will suggest the two\nflowers,\u2014a ' portmanteau ' in fact. Daphne, as the classical\nreader will remember, will well stand for the bay, and the\nsound of the first syllable is the same as in daffodils. The\nsuggestion is extremely fanciful, and not in the least likely to\noccur to my conscious mind, but apparently the methods of the\nsubliminal self are not those of the supraliminal. ' Wordsworth's\ndaffodils ' would have seemed to me a complicated way of\nthinking of the flower which was the subject of the experi\nment, but I suppose that it is after all arrived at by a\nprocess similar to that which brought Horace's lines to my\nconscious mind when I looked at the leaves of the bay. It\nwould however certainly never have occurred to me to seek\na single word to represent the two flowers, nor to combine\nthem by symbolism and assonance in \" Daphne.\" The incident\nis perhaps of some interest as showing the extremely far-fetched\nnature of associations in the region of my subliminal self, the\npart played by assonance, and the suggestion that a fanciful\nrepresentation is easier to transfer to another subliminal\nintelligence than is a simple concrete notion.\n(V.) PUNS.\nHere is another point in which toy subliminal and supra\nliminal selves differ. I have hardly ever made a pun in my\nlife ; I do not easily see analogies between words, and I am\nseldom amused by comic puns or interested by the ancient\noracular play upon words. But it is otherwise with the\nautomatic script. It is fond of punning and especially of\npunning upon names ; it is indeed quite like an ancient\noracle in its desire to find a meaning in a name, as well as\nin its complete disregard for the laws of philology. Puns\nare scattered throughout the writings and are by no means\nmore common in the earlier than in the later script, though\nthe less serious examples are perhaps in the first productions.\nThe first pun ! appeared very soon after the writing began.\n1 A complete list is given in the App., p. 361.\n\f60 Chapter III. [PART\nOn March 14, 1901, in an unintelligible passage apparently\nconcerned with an inscription, occur the words : \" hiero-\nglyphema sane marmario glyptato non sine caelato quid dicam\nstellate cultellario.\" Little can be said of this incompre\nhensible medley except that it clearly contains a pun on the\ntwo meanings of the Latin word caelum, \" chisel \" and\n\" heaven \" ; the first meaning was apparently intended, then\nthe second meaning seems to occur to the scribe 1 and produces\nthe allusion to the \" starry \" knife, or whatever he may please\nto mean by cultellario. The play upon the word is marked\nby the regular classical phrase, quid dicam ? \" may I say ? \".\nThe same word caelare furnishes another shocking pun on\nApril 22, 1901, when the proverbial remark about the art\nrequired to conceal art, Ars est celare artem, is at once followed\nby the quasi-correction \" better to carve,\" caelare melius. The\nscribe adds the comment \" you write nicely, though there is\na lack of sense owing to your want of faith,\" and it is\ndifficult to resist the conclusion that this commendation,\nqualified though it be, is due to satisfaction at having worked\noff another pun.\nOn June 3, 1901, the mention of scriptura in the sense of\nwriting at once brings in vectigal? though taxation has no\nplace in the context. A few days later comes the first pun\non a name; on July 23, 1901, describing the arrival of some\nvisitor to England,3 the script said : \" To Lodge he goes first\nto lodge.\" The next attempt, on Aug. 10, 1901, was more\ningenious ; to see the pun requires a knowledge of the Greek\nname (electron) of amber, mentioned only in English in the\nscript, but lest the casual reader should miss the point the\nimportant word is written in a larger hand :\nAmber and verdigris and the result electrifies the world.\nTry another amalgam quite as hard to mix\u2014and you will fiiid the\ntruth.\nNeedless to say no other amalgam has been tried, nor has\nany amalgam of amber and verdigris been discovered !\n1 Here and elsewhere I use the word \" scribe \" to denote that\nwhich produces the automatic script as distinguished from my\nnormal personality.\n2 Scriptura and vectigal are two kinds of taxes.\n3 The incident is possibly veridical; see below, p. 199.\n\fLIII.] Other General Characteristics. 61\nThe later plays upon words seem more serious. On Feb.\n10, 1902, in a description1 of a person hitherto unidentified,\nthe script has : Magister sui generis ambulando dicta\u2014non sane\nobiter dicta\u2014-promulgat. \" A Master in his own line (?) he\npronounces maxims as he walks, but not obiter dicta ; \"\u2014the pun\nis not translateable. The description suggests a Peripatetic\nphilosopher.\nTwo of the puns occur in passages that seem to recall Neo-\nPlatonic or late Greek philosophical writings and are elsewhere\ndiscussed ; 2 the second of these passages appears to be mystic\nin character, and that being so, the explanation of a technical\nword by a fanciful derivation is not out of place.\nOn Feb. 13, 1903, occurred a pun on the two meanings\nof the Latin clavis, a \" key \" and a \" club,\" with an un-\nmistakeable allusion to the Hercules Furens of Euripides.\nA very elaborate pun on the name Christopher occurred on\nJan. 29, 1904. Two meanings are suggested, neither of them\nphilologically possible, but there is no allusion to the common\nderivation, or to the legend which makes St. Christopher the\n\" Christ-bearer.\" The name Christopher is that of a nephew\nand god-son whose birthday is on Feb. 5, seven days after\nthe introduction of the name in the script. The name\nChristopher appears towards the end of the writing in quasi-\narchaic Greek capitals, thus :\nXP\u20acT, XPICTO0OPOC, xpimov <f>iap no \\prprTov <t>opd. Can't\nyou see the double sense 1 Do understand.\nThe light of the Sanctuary and the Bearer of Good.\nThen comes the Greek x (Chi) as signature.\nThe explanations or translations given by the script are not\ncorrect renderings of the two Greek phrases, but involve blun\nders which it needs little acquaintance with Greek to detect.\nIf the first is to mean \" Light of the Sanctuary,\" the word\n<fxap (thief) must be supposed equivalent to <pw, \" light,\" and\nit is a considerable strain upon the meaning of ^io-ro?,\n\" anointed,\" to make it mean Sanctuary. In the second phrase,\n(f)opd could not mean \" bearer \" though it does mean \" burden.\"\nAll these facts were perfectly well known to me ; I have no\n1 See above, p. 55. 2 See p. 288.\n\f62 Chapter III. [PART\nturn for punning, no interest in derivations, no sympathy with\nfanciful symbolism of any sort ; nor am I likely to confuse\neither <pd>p and <\u00a3o>?, or <fropd and <popos. This is one of\nmany cases where there seems no point of contact between\nmy normal self and the productions of the scribe. I have\nentered at some length into this incident, as it seemed possible\nto put down in black and white the differences between the\nscribe and myself, differences which are constantly obvious\nto me, though not easy to explain to a reader.\nPlays on the names of two sisters, whose death was due to\nthe same accident, occur in one of several writings referring to\nthem. The names are Monica and Dorothy, and on Oct. 12,\n1904, etymological allusions were made: \"God's gift resumed;\nMonica who lived alone.\" Dorothy, of course, does mean the\ngift of God, but, whatever may be the derivation of Monica,\nit is not likely to be \/uovouco? or \/UOCO\/K^TO?, \" who lives alone.\"\n(VI.) VEKSE.\nAnother characteristic of the script not shared by my\nnormal self is a tendency to break out into verse. I am no\npoet, and have great difficulty in producing even a very short\nset of verses in English. I wrote Greek iambics years ago,\nbut have hardly ever made up a line of Latin verse.1 That\nI am capable, however, of producing some kind of verse, when\nin a condition between sleeping and waking, I discovered some\nyears ago, when, being convalescent and resting a good deal\nin the day, I used occasionally to find myself making up verse\nhalf unconsciously. The verse was always in the nature of a\nparody, and was usually, if not always, unrhymed.2 Several\nfragments of verse have occurred spontaneously in the auto\nmatic script in each of the three languages used, and on two\nor three occasions, when I have been experimenting with\nanother writer at a distance, verses of some length have been\nproduced.3 There seems an increasing tendency to produce\n1 See above, p. 33. 2I have given specimens in App., pp. 361-2.\n3 The writing which resulted when direct experiments were made\nto obtain results simultaneously with another automatic writer falls\noutside the scope of this paper, but the \" poetry \" produced under\n\fLIU.] Other General Characteristics. 63\nEnglish verse. The first long passage was obtained in July,\n1904, and a considerable quantity has been written since the\nclose of the period discussed in this paper.\nGreek Verse.\nThe first piece of verse which occurred in the script was\nin Greek, after some writing in Latin (April 14, 1901);\nit was written in uncials and is reproduced in the Appendix.1\nThe reader will note the full stop after the 12th letter and\nwill, perhaps, be as puzzled by it as I was ; he may also be\nsurprised to find this obscure fragment classed as verse\u2014or as\nanything else !\u2014if, as I did, he reads it as \" EUUSINEMATAB.\nOPHMA.\" But if he will reverse the order of the four (Greek)\nletters after the full stop, and so make the last word Ampho\ninstead of the unintelligible Ophma, he will see, as my hus\nband did, that the apparently meaningless collection of letters\ncan be divided into Greek words, and that these words form\nthe end of a hexameter line : fv vcrl vrj\/j.a.T ap' afufxa.2 There\nis no meaning, but that the words are real Greek words and\nform part of a hexameter is obvious.\nIn the Greek words quoted and commented on above\n(May 16, 1902),3 there also appears to be a rough hexameter,\ncontained in the words afi\/3poorly re vv\u00a3 e-rri ap\/mari <pona.\nThe last four of these make the end of a hexameter. If, for\nthe word TS, a long monosyllable were substituted, we should\nhave nearly a complete verse. Perhaps that was recognised by\nthe scribe, for to the words is appended the criticism : \" no a\nword wrong\u2014somewhere. Put it right. ask him\nwhich.\"\nOn July 3, 1903, more attempts were made to produce\nGreek hexameters. I quote the whole passage, which, as will\nbe seen, becomes more and more like verse as it goes on,\nwinding up with a complete line. We were staying at the\ntime of its production at a hotel high up on the Rigi in\nthese circumstances is given in the Appendix to this section (p. 362)\nto illustrate the kind of thing obtained.\n1 See App., p. 365. 2 Or fv vcrlv 1'jfiar' ap' a\/J.<f><a.\n3 See p. 43.\n\f64 Chapter III.

They present few, if any, points of interest. In two\ncases where more than one line is given the scribe appears\nto be aware that he has not been very successful, as the\nverses are followed by the comments, \"it is not quite right.\nBut you have the idea, it is hard to catch\" (Aug. 8, 1903),\nand again (May 26, 1904) non bene omnia\u2014etsi quaedam. \"It\nis not all right though some of it is.\" Three times a\nGreek iambic line seems to have been employed, not for its\nown sake, but to convey to me a remark. These are among\nthe rare occasions on which Greek has been used as the\nmedium (of communication between the scribe and myself.\nLatin Verse.\nThe Latin verse is much more fragmentary ; scattered about\namong phrases entirely irrelevant are a few scraps with\nhexameter rhythm, such as eras meliora supersunt (Jan. 13,\n1902), which for excellent reasons I do not translate; monet\nne dixeris omni quod tibi confitear soli, \" He warns you not to\n* Trans. \" To the thresholds of the gods the night-wandering\nmoon on her silvered car goes (?).

The first few words of this last sentiment are in\na larger hand, intended, I suppose, to prevent my overlooking\nthe poetical outburst. Magno contendis corpore contra looks like\na fragment of genuine Latin poetry, but I have not been able\nto trace it (Nov. 3, 1902). The first part of the writing of\nMarch 1, 1903, consisted of scraps of hexameter lines, the\nsort of rubbish that one might produce when half asleep ; no\nline is complete, there is no consecutive sense, and no general\nmeaning. On July 15, 1904, the script tried its hand\nwith extremely poor success at Latin Sapphics ; there is a\ndiscernible meaning in these, but no other interest. The\ncurious reader will find all these efforts reproduced in the\nAppendix.1\nEnglish- Verse.\nEnglish verse was not introduced so early as Latin or\nGreek. The first appeared on Feb. 23, 1903, when I was\nsitting at the same time as two other friends in another place\nwho were working Planchette.2 My script, after dealing with\nother matters, concluded with the following lines:\nLover who lives to learn\u2014\nGiver the gift to earn,\nWisdom the love to feel,\nFriendship the bond to seal.\nOn April 9, 1903, again at the end of writing on a quite\nirrelevant topic, the script wound up with a verse :\nand daisies pied upon the green\nand the cuckoo's foot between\nMerrify Merrily\nCall it early call it often\nWoods to bloom and buds to soften\nHappily happily.\nAnother attempt at verse (Jan. 17, 1904) was of a\ndifferent type ; it is less complete and more conscious,\nrecognising its intention and its want of success. After\nsaying something about Hope, the script goes on :\n!See App., p. 366. 2See p. 250.\nE\n\f66 Chapter III.

On September 18th, 1904, a\nmore serious attempt was made to produce verse, but, as the\nscript itself recognised, it was \" poor stuff.\" I quote the whole\npassage as it illustrates the methods of the scribe. It will be\nseen that the first two stanzas are written consecutively as if\nthey were prose. The third stanza is recognised to be verse,\nbut it is incomplete, a dissyllable being wanted to complete\nthe rhythm ia the first line. The meaning of the lacking word\nis suggested by the script itself and after a further effort a\ncriticism on the whole production is pronounced.\nfor many a month the hand of time has shewn to all\nthat pass this sign and this alone yet have the careless\ngenerations failed to read . so blindly lurks the flower with\nin the seed .\nThe riotous colours of the autumn flames have touched the\nbracken, turning green to gold, the wandering songsters going as\nthey came by the long journey flee the winters cold.\nSo each successive\nthere is a word that means a group\nin its turn\nfills with its dust the cinerary urn\nurn behind urn in numberless array\nthe records of past glories still decay\nBut none of this says what I want to say\u2014write this week more\noften and especially OH Wednesday morning next\u2014-not such poor\nstuff as this.\nPlain Prose is best.\n1 But see below, p. 297, for a possible explanation of the association\nof ideas in the above.\n\fLiu.] Varieties of Dramatic Form. 67\nCHAPTER IV.\nVARIETIES OF DRAMATIC FORM ASSUMED BY THE SCRIPT.\nSo far the topics discussed have concerned the form adopted\nby the script rather than the nature of its contents, though\nin the last few groups there is reason to suppose intention in\nthe selection of the particular form, or at least recognition\non the part of the scribe of the form adopted. I pass to\nthe contents, . taking first the cases where these are, so to\nsay, expressed by the form, and afterwards other cases where\nthe form appears to be of no importance.\nThere are two main groups where the form seems intended\nto convey some meaning. The mass of the writing consists\nof unsigned observations, not to be attributed to any identifiable\nperson, though often expressed in the first person \" I,\" and\naddressed to some one in the second person \" you,\" presumably\nmyself.1 But two other types occur\u2014one where the script seems\nto represent a conversation between two or more persons,\nand another where a directly personal note is introduced\nby the appending of a signature to the supposed communi\ncation. It is not easy always to distinguish these classes,\nas the reader who has followed me so far will understand,\nseeing how dream-like and confused are the utterances of the\nscript. In many cases, although there is no signature to the\ncommunication, the writing bears witness in its contents to\nits being ostensibly addressed to me by various identifiable\npersons. Again, it is clearly not possible to determine with\ncertainty, in the absence of change of language or writing,\nwhether the observations of the script are supposed to be\n!This person \"I\" is what I have called \"the scribe,\" and I wish\nhere to emphasise the statement that the scribe is not an indirect\nway of alluding to a particular supposed communicator, but a general\nname for the writing hand, which\u2014for whatever reason\u2014assumes a\ndramatic personality.\n\f68 Chapter IV.

CONVERSATIONS.\nThe first hint that more than one person must be sup\nposed to be having a say is found on March 30, 1901,\nthough I did not interpret it till long afterwards, when the\nconversational form had unmistakeably appeared.1 The writ\ning on that date2 begins with the remark that there are\nas many opinions as there are speakers. A few days later,\nApril 3, 1901, the first unmistakeable conversation appears, the\nremarks of the second speaker being written in a large round\nhand sharply distinguished from the particularly small hand\nwriting of the body of this piece of script. The contents\nare of no interest ; their meaning is perhaps clearer or rather\nless obscure than was usually the case at this early period,\nbut nothing of any value was said. The person addressed as\n\" you \" would seem, at least in one instance here, not to be\nmyself, but some one else who answers in the first person.\nWhen reproached with not doing something, this person replies\nthat he has done it, Feci, whereas I 3 had not done anything.\n1The reader must understand that most of the opinions about\nthe script expressed in this paper are the result of long observa\ntion and familiarity; in many cases later writings have thrown\nlight upon the earlier productions; at the beginning the phenomena\nseemed unanalysable, and I avoided as far as possible forming any\ntheory about them.\n2 See Appendix, p. 366, for list of all these supposed conversations.\n3 Perhaps the reproaches for stupidity and inattention described\nbelow (p. 89) may in some cases not be addressed to me, but to\nsome other would-be communicator or intermediary; it is probable\nin any case, however, that they reflect my own feeling of impatience\nat the extreme difficulty of seeing any sense in the farrago freely\nproduced with an exasperating air of superior knowledge.\n\fLiu.] Varieties of Dramatic Form. 69\nI do not class as conversations the considerable number of\ncases where communications are ostensibly made by more than\none \" control,\" in order to give a new message or to complete\nor correct what was said by the first. Here I refer only\nto cases of apparent confusion, where\u2014to use a familiar illus\ntration\u2014the telephone-wires seem to have got into contact,\nso that the operator hears remarks not addressed directly to\nhim. Thus on Jan. 13, 1902, the script has:\nPatience for you both. it will come Three Latin words\ncan she not write them 1 would give the clue. quid fremuerunt\ngentesl gentes seems right\u2014gens togata rapit\u2014 Non\npossum plurima hodie cras meri meliora supersunt. C r a s\nmeliora supersunt.\nI do not profess to explain this, but I think that it is a\ncase such as I have described. The words \" can she not\nwrite them ? \" break into the midst of the phrase, \" Three\nLatin words would give the clue,\" and suggest that they were\nunintentionally recorded\u2014just as the telephone occasionally\nrecords the impatient observations of the young woman at\nthe Central Office. Who is meant by \" you \" and \" she \" I\ncannot say, but the words \" gentes seems right \" appear to be\na criticism on the three preceding words, which, if they are\nintended for a quotation, should read \" Quare fremuerunt\ngentes.\" Again, the repetition of the three final words sug\ngest that when they first appeared they were not said to\nme, but addressed by one communicator to another, who then\ntransmitted to me what seemed important, unaware that the\nwhole had already been caught and recorded.\nSimilarly on Aug. 7, 1901, after a long message meant\napparently to be verifiable, came the words :\nThis is something new\u2014perhaps a test\u2014I dont understand\nquite. Who is it ?\nThen follows abruptly an allusion to a wholly different\nincident. In this case it seems to be recognised that there\nis confusion, and the words \" I don't understand \" are perhaps\nunintentionally recorded. The confusion is greater on Feb.\n13, 1902, and there partly marked by a change in the\nwriting. On Oct. 23, 1903, after confusion, some attempt\n\f70 Chapter IV. [PART\nis made to remedy it, with success as far as the fluency of the\nwriting is concerned, though the meaning of the message thus\nproduced is not obvious. The early part of this script was\nproduced, as noted at the time, with great difficulty ; the\nwords \" faith fled, Hope stayed \" refer to an earlier piece of\nwriting ; then the script has : \" when did that happen ?\u2014no\nthis is not right. Stop it is too difficult\u2014let her write.\"\nThen with the new paragraph the writing came quite easily.\nIn the above case again it cannot be determined whether\nthe \" she \" refers to myself or to some supposed communicator\ntemporarily displaced,1 but on Jan. 15, 1903, I was undoubtedly\nreferred to in the third person ;\nWait for the word. He said \"I2 will send the half message to\nMrs. Verrall and you have the other half. Tell Hodgson this, but\nyou have not got the word yet.\nThen came further unsuccessful attempts to produce a recog\nnisable word.\nOn November 25th, 1904, there appears to be another\ninstance where a sentence in the script represents a remark\nabout me in the midst of other remarks addressed to me. Thus\nafter saying, apparently to me, \"Why will you not look for\nit.\" the script goes on :\nTell them that.\nLong have they waited we do not know why\u2014but can do no\nmore. Don't touch her\u2014let her work alone, the touch\nconfuses.\nIt is probable that the \" you \" who will not look refers to\nme, and almost certain that I am intended also by the \" her \"\nwho is not to be touched.\nThere are two or three other cases where reference is made\nin the third person to some one, probably another supposed\ncommunicator, but it is not certain whether such reference is\nintentional, nor to whom it is addressed. Thus on Aug. 16,\n1901, after a long message relating entirely to the attempts\n1 There is the same difficulty in the script of March 20, 1903. See\nApp. pp. 352, 3.\n2 The inverted commas before \" I \" appear in the script, but there\nis no mark for the end of the quotation.\n\fmi.] Varieties of Dramatic Form. 71\nto guess my husband's Greek sentence,1 addressed throughout\nby \" me \" to \" you,\" there comes a statement of what some\none else, a third person, says ; here the change of language may\nindicate change in the communication. It runs :\nA.W.V. will understand this\u2014I think of him when I say it. you do\nnot know. Mone inquit alteram, ne titubet\u2014non semper recte\nfit quod rnanu incipit*\nIt continues in Greek and Latin and concludes with a curiously\nconfused signature.\nAgain, on Oct. 6, 1901, after describing an incident in\nEnglish, the script suddenly breaks into Latin, and in a\nslightly larger handwriting says2 \" He warns you not to tell\neveryone what I am admitting to you only.\" Then after\nconfused attempts to put things for A.W.V. with greater clear\nness, and complaints that \"neither you nor I know it, so it\nis hard to get. It all belongs to him but not to me his\nfriends but not mine. No one here knows but one and her\nI have not met,\" it goes on \" I will ask Arthur \" and returns\nto the incident with which it started.\nOn March 15, 1903, we have what looks like an uninten\ntional report of a discussion between two would-be com\nmunicators :\n2 is the first to be recognised but there are others. write\nyourself mow Otranto pice cur non cetera 1 quia\nnon comprehendit ilia nostr a fac quiescat. Signum illud\npro bono, sed non omne.\nThe last sentence \" that sign is to the good but it is not the\nwhole,\" clearly refers back to the first remark ; but between\nthe two come words that are only intelligible if we suppose\nthem to be addressed by the communicators to one another,\nand assign them to different speakers, thus :\nA. \" Write yourself now.\"\nB. makes futile efforts.\nC. \"Why not (give?) the rest?\"\n* Trans, \"Tell the other (feminine), he says, not to stumble; what\nher hand begins is not always right.\"\n^ee p. 156. 2See above, p. 64.\n\f7? Chapter IV. [PART\nD. \"Because she does not understand our (words?)\"\nE. \" Get (some one) to be quiet. That sign &c.\"\nIn this division of the remarks between various speakers\nI am guided partly by the gaps between the words\u2014to which\nexperience has led me to attach considerable importance1\u2014\nand partly by the sense. I make no attempt to assign the\nparts, only to mark the breaks.\nOnce, on Feb. 1, 1904, the earlier part of the script\nappears to represent a reported conversation between two\npersons, one of whom is trying to catch what the other says,\nbut without much success. Then with a new paragraph one\nseems to assume \" control \" and gives a connected message ;\nthe next paragraph represents another person commenting on\nwhat has preceded.2 A somewhat similar case of supplementary\nstatements by a second communicator is found on Dec. 4,\n1902, but in that case there is no reported conversation\nbetween the supposed communicators ; both seem to address\nme directly.3\nThe best illustration of a conversation occurs in a piece\nof writing not included in the 306 pieces which make the\nsubject of analysis in this paper. It was produced on December\n5th, 1904, not spontaneously, but as the result of an experiment\nin simultaneous writing in the presence of others. The con\nversational form may have been due to suggestion from the\ncircumstances of its production. But it is of the same type as\nother conversations spontaneously produced, though the differ\nentiation of the speakers is emphasised by a change of hand\nwriting as well as by the use of paragraphs. The first few\nsentences cannot be definitely distributed among the supposed\nspeakers, but in the fourth paragraph a sloping handwriting is\nintroduced, and thenceforth to the end of the communication\n1 Amid the general confusion and difficulty of interpretation, some\nthings seem to stand out as important ; e.g. gaps between words and\nnew paragraphs,\u2014not that such a break invariably has an ascertain-\nable meaning, but it seems best to assume, in the absence of strong\nevidence to the contrary, that it indicates some sort of change in\nwhatever it is that produces the script.\n2 See below, p. 211, for comment on the script of Feb. 1, 1904.\n3 This script possesses no interest, and, not being counted as a,\nconversation, is not. quoted in the Appendix.\n\fLin.] Varieties of Dramatic Form. 73\nthe sloped writing alternates with my ordinary hand and\nrepresents one speaker in a dialogue, the parts of which are\nplainly distinguishable. Thus, beginning with the paragraph\nwhere the hand changes, and representing the sloping writing\nby italics, we have the following : .\nThen there is a line of verse to be remembered Heaven lies about\nus in our infancy\u2014that has a special quite a special association.\nrepeat the line again\nIt has teen written down, go on to the next trial\nCecilia was a name wanted\n\/ cannot make this clear.\nThe instructions have come elsewhere, they should be followed,\nthen wait for the results.\n\/ cannot work this easily\nYou do not attend to the instructions\n\/ cannot hear what they say or understand what they do\nSay it was Thursday that was meant.\nIt was Thursday meant.\n(II.) SIGNATURES.\nThere are altogether 148 cases of signatures or attempts at\nsignature, in the 306 pieces of script here discussed; thus, less\nthan half the pieces are signed, for it sometimes happens that\na single piece of writing has two signatures, a second signed\nparagraph being occasionally added after the first signature.\nThe signatures are not always the last word in the writing\nwhere they occur, as occasionally after a signature a fresh\nstart is made and further remarks added, not signed. Nor\nmust the signature be taken in all cases as attached to the\nwhole of what precedes ; sometimes a \u2022 change of handwriting\nor a break of some kind indicates what words are supposed\nto be written by the person signing. Often it is impossible\nto assign with certainty a definite portion of the script to\nthe ostensible writer.\nIn these 148 signatures I have counted all cases where a\nname, or initial, or sign,1 has been appended to a statement\n1 A considerable number of signs appear as signatures ; some\nof these have been identified, but not all. They are described\nbelow.\n\f74 Chapter IV. [PART\nso as to give the whole the air, generally speaking, of a letter\nand not a memorandum. They may he thus classified:\nClassification of Signatures.\n(A) Unfinished attempts 12\n(B) Unidentified :\n(1) names, proper, - - - - 5\n(2) fancy names, 5\n(3) initials, ----- 5\n(4) signs, - - - - 29\nTotal, 44\n(C) Unintelligible, 9\n(D) Identified:\n(1) name of living, 1\n(2) names of dead,1 - - - 48\n(3) signs for dead, 34\nTotal, 83\nTotal, therefore, in all, - - 148\n(A) Unfinished attempts.\nSome of these have been discussed above 2 ; they are included\nhere among signatures, as they distinctly give the writing a\npersonal note. They are of the following type :\n1. Vale .... signifer signum ponit.\n2. Usque ad illud vale.\nTuus.\n3. Tuus iam ante signator. *\n4. Yours as you know.\n5. not your friend but another.\nThis indefinite form of signature was commoner in the earlier\nthan in the later writings. Thus of the twelve instances ten\noccur in the first two years of the writing. It would appear\n*1. Trans. \"Good-bye\u2014the seal-bearer sets his seal.\" 2. \"Till\nthen good-bye\u2014Yours.\" 3. \"Yours\u2014who has signed before this.\"\n1 Initials and suggestions of name are included under names.\n2 See above, p. 29.\n\fLiu.] Varieties of Dramatic Form, 75\nthat on the whole, this signature is used when the contents\nof the script are of some interest or evidential value.\nThus, in eight out of ten cases, decided success attended the\nefforts to produce evidential matter made by this supposed\nwriter who, it should be noted, though he does not append his\nname, seems\u2014to judge from the manner of his writing\u2014to\nhave assumed that he would be recognised. But in the absence\nof a direct statement as to who was intended by the person\nsigning \" yours,\" etc., it has seemed better to regard these\nsignatures as unfinished attempts and not as identified\nsignatures.\n(\u00a3) Unidentified signatures.\n(1) Proper names:\nOf 5 unidentified names used as signatures three are in\nhandwritings not my own ; R. Nevile and his story have been\ndescribed.1 \"Mortimer Gothard, 1703\" or some such person\nappears as a signature only on Feb. 9, 1904; and on Oct.\n29, 1901, Alec-K signed some remarks apparently intended\nto be evidential, but so far unverified. This communicator\nre-appeared twice; thus on Nov. 1, 1901, \"Alec can try again\nlater,\" and on Nov. 4, 1901, \"Frodsham and a river in the\nwinter it was frozen Alec Keith to the friend of another.\"\nK. has developed into Keith, and the place originally described\nas \" Frendsham or Frettisham perhaps Frodsham \" has remained\nFrodsham, but no enquiries have thrown any light on this\nepisode. One unidentified name, Eloise, appears only as a\nsignature, and conveys nothing to me (Oct. 31, 1902); another,\nin an early script, also has no meaning, but is here described in\ndetail as possibly illustrating the gradual emergence of an idea\nnot at first recognisable.2 The script of June 27, 1901, was\nsigned as follows :\nTwo drawings of curved objects ; then the words, \" or a\ngourd.\" Then three drawings representing apparently (1) a\ngourd, (2) a cross,3 (3) the horns or ears of an animal ; then the\nwords \" moses not the prophet.\" ; then a line between two\nbrackets and the name \"Johann.\"\n'See p. 24.\n2 See also above, p. 55, on \" portmanteau \" phrases.\n3 This cross is counted as a drawing, not as a signature.\n\f76 Chapter IV. [PART\nIt seems as if there were a definite aim behind all these\nefforts ; possibly even the final effort is not completely correct,\nand what underlies it all is \" Jonah \" not \" John,\" three\nattempts being made to suggest the name Jonah; (1) the\ngourd, (2) the prophet, (3) the name Johann. If this is so, it\nwill be seen that the second of these two notions, the prophet,\ndoes not itself emerge at once, but is preceded by \" horns \"\nand then \" Moses.\" This suggested explanation fails to account\nfor the cross, but as it possibly throws light on the methods\nof the script, or on what appear to me to be its methods, I\nhave thought this digression justified. Another suggestion has\nbeen made to me that in the Latin cross,1 taken in conjunction\nwith \" horns \" and \" Moses not the -prophet,\" are to be found\nallusions to W. Stainton Moses and his well-known \" control \"\nImperator. In that case there seems no explanation for the\ngourd, or the name John.\n(B 2) Fancy names.\n(\u00a33) Initials.\nThe unidentified fancy names and initials present no points\nof interest.\n(54) Signs.\nEighteen2 of the twenty-nine unidentified signs represent some\nform of cross ; I had proposed to class these all together, but\nas on a closer examination there seems to be some distinction\nbetween the value of the writing signed by different kinds\nof crosses,3 I have subdivided the class. The types of cross\nused are three, \"j~ X + ; of these -j~ is used twice, x five\ntimes, + eight times, while once x and + are combined,\nand once all three forms appear together.\nLatin Cross.\nThis cross appears on two consecutive days, Aug. 25 and 26,\n1902, the first time alone with the word cross written beside\n!See below, p. 79.\n2 Or possibly 17, if an ill-executed drawing, resembling a Latin\ncross upside down, or a Greek cross with too long an upper arm,\nis not interpreted as a cross.

Neither piece of\nwriting contains anything of interest; the second is particularly\nscrappy.\nSt. Andrew's Cross.\nThis appears as a signature five times on May 27, 1901,\non October 21 and 25, 1902; on January 21, 1903; and\non Jan. 29, 1904, but on none of these days was anything\nwritten which seems to show supernormal knowledge. On the\nfirst four occasions, matter was produced which purported to\nbe verifiable, but there is little or no reason to attach value\nto the statements.2 The last occasion on which the transverse\ncross is used is immediately below the unwarranted philological\nstatements about the name Christopher described above.3\nGreek Cross.\nThe Greek cross + is used eight * times as a signature,\nfive times plain, twice enclosed in a circle, and once with\na decoration at the intersection of the arms. Once also it\nis used in combination with the transverse cross, and as the\ncombination occurs on Jan. 31, 1902, after three preceding\nscripts signed with the Greek cross I shall consider that case\ntogether with these, so making altogether 9 occasions where\nthe Greek cross is used.\nOn six of these nine occasions reference is made in the\naccompanying script either to Dr. Hodgson or to Mrs. Piper,\nand on the other three matter of interest is given\u2014twice (Oct.\n12, 1901, Dec. 7, 1903) instances of apparent thought-trans\nference from friends,5 and on May 31, 1901, the first reference\n1 See App. p. 355, where the script is given.\n2 See p. 284 for detailed account of statements by the script on\nMay 27, 1901.\n3 See p. 61.\n4 Or nine times, if the ill-executed drawing of Oct. 26, 1901, is\ncounted as a Greek cross.\n5 See pp. 283, 285.\n\f78 Chapter IV. [PART\nto the passage from Plato's Symposium which plays so large\na part in the script.1 On four consecutive occasions reference\nwas made to Dr. Hodgson or Mrs. Piper in writing signed\nwith the Greek cross, one of these being apparently a\nsuccessful attempt to establish a connexion between my,writing\nand Mrs. Piper's trance.2 I had been interrupted in this\nwriting, and, after a persistent desire to write, which circum\nstances prevented me from obeying, produced at the first\nopportunity a few hours later on the same day the words :\nCrux et praeterea nihil \" only a cross,\" and, after some\ngeneral remarks in Latin, the following signature consisting of\na Greek and a transverse cross each enclosed in a circle and\njoined together by two lines :\nOn April 27, 1903, the script produced evidential matter\nfor \" Hodgson,\" subsequently verified by him, and the signature\nwas a Greek cross.

I am familiar with the report in the\nProceedings of the phenomena of Stainton Moses, and was\naware that a cross was used in the signature of several of his\n\" controls.\" But I had certainly never consciously distinguished\nbetween the use of the Latin and Greek cross, though the\ndistinction is plainly observed, as any one may see who looks\nat the facsimiles in the Proceedings.\nWhen my script on July 21, 1903, stated plainly that a\ncertain cross\u2014here described as a decorative Greek cross\u2014was\nthe mark of Rector, I sent a copy to Dr. Hodgson and asked\nwhether such a drawing had appeared in any writing during\nMrs. Piper's sittings, where much of the automatic script is\nostensibly the work of Rector. But Dr. Hodgson had no\nrecollection of any such drawing. I therefore supposed the\nconjunction of Rector's name and a cross to be a reminiscence\nof my knowledge of the Stainton Moses phenomena. So I\nstill take it to be, but the reminiscence is at once more\naccurate and less mechanical than I had supposed it. The\ncross of Rector in my script is no exact reproduction of\nRector's cross as shown in the Proceedings, but while putting\non a decoration it retains the characteristic of the Greek cross\nwith equal branches, always associated with the Rector of\nMr. Stainton Moses.\nThat the distinction between the Latin cross of Imperator\nand the Greek cross of Rector\u2014not consciously observed by\nme\u2014was recognised by my subliminal self is clear, not only\nfrom the statement that the decorative Greek cross is the sign\nof Eector (July 21, 1903, posuit signum suum ipse), but also\nfrom the conjunction in the script of August 26, 1902, of the\nLatin cross with the capital I, which obviously stands for\nImperator. I had noticed the Christian symbolism in the cross\nand fish, but was puzzled to account for the capital I.\nThe published accounts of the Stainton Moses phenomena\nthus explain the appearance in my script of the Latin and\nGreek crosses. But I have so far found no explanation of\nthe St. Andrew's or transverse cross. This does not appear\nto have been used by the \" controls \" of Mr. W. Stainton\nMoses.\n\ftin.] Varieties of Dramatic Form. 81\nOther Signs.\nOf other signs used nine occur singly and call for no com\nment ; they are of various sorts, geometrical patterns, mere\nscribbles, a flower, three anchors ; a palm appears three times,\nin each case with a sword. The sword appears to have been\nidentified.1 But no identification has been attempted for the\npalm, which is so ill drawn that I might have hesitated what\nname to give it but for the kind suggestion of the script,\nwhich wrote beneath the first appearance of these two objects,\non Aug. 6, 1901, \"the sword and the palm.\"\nI have classed as a signature a star, which terminated one\npiece of writing, as it appears in the usual place for a sig\nnature, but I am disposed to believe that it forms part of\nthe body of the script. On Sept. 7, 1901, when the script\nwas trying to reproduce three Greek words wanted by my\nhusband it ended \" Banipal and Assur,\" then, as another shot,\n\" Asta aster,\" and a rough drawing of a star. If this star is\nnot counted as a signature, eight cases remain of miscellaneous\nsignatures, only two of which follow script containing any\nthing of. possible interest ; the other six are appended to some\nof the most worthless of the writings.\n(C) Unintelligible signatures.\nOf these there are in all nine ; two of them belong to the\nfirst two months of the script, when the greater part of what\nwas written was unintelligible, and the third is appended to a\nwholly unintelligible writing, also quite early. The writing\npreceding five others contains nothing of interest, and in three\ncases is hardly intelligible ; there may be a point in the\nscript of Dec. 22, 1901, but not enough to make it worth\nquoting.\n(D) Identified Signatures.\n(1) Signature of the living..\nThe initials of Mr. Piddington, which appeared at the end\nof a communication on Sept. 6, 1902, have been counted\namong signatures, though an inspection of the script suggests\nthat a message for him and not from him was intended.

As regards the nature of the communi\ncations definitely attributed in the script to specified persons,\nthere is not sufficient material upon which to base a\njudgment. All that can be said at present is that it appears\nfrom an analysis of the statements made and signed by various\nnames or symbols, that the so-called signatories have a certain\nindividuality, in that some of them have a special faculty for\nmaking remarks of interest or remarks of a particular type.\nThus the owner of the Greek cross, whether we call him\nRector or not, is a specially successful communicator and seems\nto have a particular interest in Mrs. Piper and Dr. Hodgson ;\nthe owner of the transverse cross, on the other hand, makea\nefforts to produce evidential matter, but with very little\n!See p. 126.

This individualism was not the least realised by me\nat the time ; it was only when I tabulated the statements\nunder various signatures for the purpose of this paper (in\nMarch and April, 1905) that I discovered that the signatories\nappeared, at least in some instances, to possess distinguishing\ncharacteristics. How far this may be due to dramatisation on\nthe part of my subliminal self I cannot say.\n\f84 Chapter V. [PART\nCHAPTER V.\nCOMMENTS IN THE SCRIPT ON THE PHENOMENA AND THE\nMETHOD OF PRODUCTION.\nA LARGE part of the contents of the writings consist of what\nmay be described as personal matters,\u2014communications, that is,\naddressed by the scribe to myself, concerning the value of the\nstatements made, the difficulty of communication, the efforts\nnecessary to produce the writing, the success or failure of\nparticular attempts, the best conditions for improvement, and\nother similar topics. These may be classified under two main\nheads: (I.) statements, (II.) exhortations; and the latter fall con\nveniently into two divisions, (a) general exhortations, encourage\nment or reproach ; and (&) specific directions for the conduct\nof the business of communicating. For the purposes of this\nsection no distinction is drawn between the various writers or\nlisteners, such as has been attempted above ; 1 it is here\npresumed that the first person ' I ' represents what I call the\nscribe, and that the second person ' you ' stands for my own\nnormal personality.\n(I.) STATEMENTS AS TO SUCCESS, FAILURE, CAPACITY, DIFFI\nCULTY, ETC.\nSuccess.\nThe statements as to success in transmission vary ; some\ntimes they are perfectly general: \"keep this; it will be\nwanted \" ; sometimes the writer congratulates himself on his\nfluency or felicity of phrase, or remarks that there is \" some\nthing in this if you could only see it \" ; on other occasions\nhe states definitely that he has produced this time what may\nbe verified. There is, I fear, little connexion between the\n!See p. 68.\n\fLIII.] Comments by Script on Phenomena. 85\nsatisfaction of the writer and the clearness or correctness of\nthe script. Thus, on March 13, 1901, in a hopelessly obscure\npassage, occur the words : modo cecini carmen ineluctabile\nauribus tuis, \" I have just sung a song that cannot escape\nyour hearing,\" and the next day the unintelligible words :\ndulcissime sonat imago clara pulsanti pedetemptin, \" most sweetly\nsounds the clear echo to one who dances a-foot,\" are followed\nby the remark : quam bene fed illud ! \" how well I did\nthat.\" The expressions (Nov. 7, 1901, and Jan. 8,\n1902), o quam bene currit plumula saepe red.it sensus,\n\" how well the pen runs, the sense is repeated,\" and o quam\nbene currit calamus paterna lingua, \" how well runs the pen in\nits native tongue,\" may refer to the greater fluency in\nLatin which was certainly shown at first, rather than to\nany specific success. But when the hand remarks that \" this\nis a clue,\" or that \" this is verifiable,\" after producing some\nthing quite vague or hopelessly confused, we can only express\na pious hope that the future may justify the writer's claim.\nOnly on three of the eleven occasions when success was\nclaimed in this way was the claim justified (June 23, 1901,\nSept. 18, 1901, and Oct. 9, 1902), though on three others\nthere may have been a measure of success.1 I do not wish\nto give the impression that the script is never to be trusted\nwhen it makes a statement about itself; on the contrary, in\nsome cases considerable value attaches to its own impres\nsions. But a general remark of the kind here described seems\nvalueless.\nFailure.\nThe statements as to failure are, generally speaking, of two\ntypes : (1) a general expression of inability, or (2) a specific\ncomplaint that a particular fact or word has not been cor\nrectly written down : probably more value attaches to the\nsecond than to the first of these two classes. It seems natural\nenough that my own constantly present sense of the futility\nof much of the writing should find expression in the script,\nand perhaps the desire for success occasionally represented\n1 See App., p. 368, where are given all statements, correct or\nincorrect, as to success, with references to the parts of this paper\nwhere such statements are discussed.\n\f86 Chapter V. [PART\nside by side with the knowledge of failure also represents\na normal feeling. The three strongest expressions of this\nfrustrated wish are in Latin, and in each case the failure is\nrecognised as being on the part of the scribe (March 6,\n1901, July 8, 1901, and Feb. 2, 1904). Many of the\nfailures are attributed to the stupidity of the recipient, and\nare classified under the head of ' reproaches.' In the greater\nnumber of the statements of failure, whether general or par\nticular, no definite cause is assigned. Once \" the light is dim,\"\ntwo or three times \"it is not clear,\" more often the script\nsays simply, \" I cannot do it,\" sometimes adding \" to-day \"\nwith a word of encouragement for \" to-morrow.\" Once in the\nmiddle of some hopeless stuff, it seemed to recognise its own\nfolly and exclaimed in Latin, that being then its normal\nlanguage, o stultiloquor ! \" what folly I talk ! \"\nIn some cases where an effort is made to give a name\nor a word for identification, the statement is more definite ;\nthus on April 20, 1901, after a signature, comes a remark\nthat some one has not put what he wanted, and that a certain\nalteration is to be made ; once it is said that there is \" a\nword wrong \" ; 1 two or three times something is said to be\n\" more like,\" though not yet right.\nBut in general there is little value in these statements\nof failure ; when the script is definitely correcting an earlier\nantecedent error, it goes straight to the problem before it\nand omits all introductory observations ; the greater number\nof these admissions of failure occur in pieces of writing which\nare obviously confused or incomplete. They are scattered\nthroughout the writing, but are rather more frequent at the\nbeginning; they are not very numerous, amounting to some\nthing like a total of 25.\nCapacity.\nThe expression of capacity or effort to communicate, unac\ncompanied by a claim to success, is almost confined to the\nwritings of the first nine months, but is there fairly frequent,\noccurring some 14 times in 90 pieces. Three of the occa\nsions when a sense of greater ease was expressed were during\nthe attempts to reproduce a sentence thought of by my\n1 See p. 63.\n\fComments by Script on Phenomena. 87\nhusband without my knowledge. I had no idea that he\nwas performing any experiment, and it was only a year or\nmore afterwards when he told me the circumstances that I\nfound that there was a connected endeavour on the part of\nthe script, and that the three pieces now in question belonged\nto that series. They were written on June 3, July 31,\nand August 16, 1901 ; and each of the three purported to\ncome from the same signatory. On another occasion, July 23,\n1901, two messages were sent, one to Sir Oliver Lodge, the\nother to Mrs. Sidgwick, and both seem to have shown some\nintelligence on the part of the scribe,1 who was therefore\nperhaps justified in saying \" it is easier to-night \" ; he adds\nthat the sign, which he then tried to give, was \" hard to\nmake\" to me, and he certainly did not succeed in producing\nanything intelligible. On Nov. 13, 1901, after Mrs. Forbes\nand I had tried Planchette together for the first time with no\nresults of interest, my script, which was particularly fluent and\n,encouraging, though it contained nothing evidential, concluded :\n\" How much easier it is to-night,\" and once, on Dec. 1 9,\n1901, though at the beginning impressed with the difficulty,\napparently on its own side, it ended by assuring me that I\n\" understood better \" that night. But the effort remains\nunintelligible.\nDesire frustrated.\nThree times the script asserted that it had made an effort\nto which I had not responded, and twice it complained in\nmore general terms that it had wanted to say something,\nbut had been prevented by me. On the last of these occa\nsions\u2014all belong to the earlier days\u2014Sept. 4, 1901, I had\nwritten, in obedience to a strong impulse, and the contents\nconcerned my husband's sentence.2 On the first occasion,\nMarch 8, 1901, my arm ached before I sat for writing, as\nit had done earlier in the day,3 and it is likely that with\nmore experience I should have recognised this aching as a\ndesire on the part of my hand to write ; that is probably\nthe explanation of the opening words of the script : veni hodi-\n\u00a3rno nondum parata eras, \" I came to-day but you were not\nyet ready.\"\n!See pp. 194-199. 2See p. 162. 3See p. 13.\n\f88 Chapter V. [PART\nOn another occasion, when I wrote in obedience to aa\nimpulse, May 3, 1901, the first words were a question as\nto why I had not written the day before when the hand\nwanted to write, and a warning that it was difficult if I\nrefused. I had felt a strong desire to write the day before\nwhile I was at a Committee meeting, but naturally had not\nbeen able to yield to it. On two of the five occasions\nwhen I apparently failed to respond I was entirely unaware\nof any special sensation.\nComplaint of difficulty.\nFrom time to time the script contains complaints of the-\ndifficulties of writing, some of them apparently inevitable,\nothers due to itself, others again\u2014and these more frequently\u2014\ndue to me. These last complaints seem addressed to me per\nsonally, but on some dozen occasions there are to be found\nobservations to the effect that \" it is dark \" and therefore use\nless to go on at that moment, or that \" it is hard \" and\n\" there is confusion,\" or again that the difficulty is due to want\nof experience ; \" it will come with patience, it is not usual\nhence the difficulty.\" Twice the scribe wrote, Tu autem\nnescis ego non possum, \" you don't know and I can't,\" and\nsometimes it says that a date or a word is hard, or that it\nis hard \" to-day.\" Besides once saying that the light was\ndim, it has on four or five occasions spoken of hindering\ndarkness, but on the whole there is a marked absence of\nthe references to \" the light \" which are common in other\nautomatic writings known to me. The complaints about\ndifficulty, like the statements of failure, are found in the-\nmore scrappy and less successful of the writings, but occa\nsionally in the midst of what proves to be of some interest\na complaint is made of the difficulty of giving a particular\nthing.\n(II.) GENERAL EXHORTATIONS.\nThere are a very considerable number of remarks through\nout the script addressed to me and urging me to \" go - on,\"\nor to \" wait for a result,\" or to \" try again,\" or to \" leave\noff now,\" and of these I do not propose to say anything, as\nthey have no interest and throw no light upon the problem\n\fLIII.] Comments by Script on Phenomena. 89\nof the writing. But possibly something may be learnt from\na consideration of the longer and more deliberate utterances.\nTo judge from the reproaches of the scribe, a great deal of\nthe difficulty and confusion is directly attributed to me ; I\nseem not only unable, but unwilling to understand\u2014indeed,\nthe unwillingness seems more obvious to the scribe than the\ninability. At first the script expressed a good deal of impa\ntience with my stupidity, wilful or otherwise : \" I should like\nto speak, but you will not let me \" ; or o mora, ingrata tibi\ncanam \" 0 the delay, I should waste my words on you \" ;\nor again, \" how can I ? help, can't you, combination is the\nbest.\" 1 Once after reproaching me with not writing earlier,\nas it had long wanted to tell rne something, it went on :\n\" you cant hear tonight. Your head is full.\" Yet the next\nday it began : \" Why did you stop yesterday ? It was interest\ning. But you did not understand.\" In time, however, the\nscribe seems to have realised that the difficulties were not\ncreated wilfully by me, for its impatience unmistakeably\nlessens with experience, and though it still tells me some\ntimes that the fault is mine, it seems to recognise that the\nfault is not intentional. \" This is not right. but you can\ndo no more,\" is the latest expression of reproach, a very con\nsiderable modification of the incisive remarks of earlier days.\nBut even in the earlier days the script was encouraging\non occasion ; after saying that it would be plain some day,\nthat it would be easier when I had gone to the mountains,\nand so on, it began to commend me. It is true that the\nfirst commendation came only after a reprimand. On Oct.\n29, 1901, it wrote (I translate the Latin):\nI have often been present; you do not always recognise your\nfriend ; lay aside your folly ; do not prefer your own interpretation\nto that of others. You do not know\u2014you, I mean, you are mistaken ;\nyou do not know. But you will be able some day. . . .2 Listen and\nlook at night. no one but you can help you. But you know\nmore now and I can do it better.\nrlt is of course possible that these observations are of the nature\nof reported conversations (see above) and not intended for me per\nsonally ; but at the time that they were made I took them as\naddressed to myself.\n2 English began here.\n\f90 Chapter V. [PART\nSix weeks later the script began with one of its rolling\nmysterious sentences that, like the poetry of dreams, appear\nimpressive till you take a nearer view, though here, judged\nwith the context, it may not be wholly meaningless : \" Unused\nof old forewarned but not exempt\u2014none is. But we learn\nlike you. It is hard.\" Then it goes on in Latin : monstro\ntiki quod vine possim ; incredibile sane verum quidem. quod si\ncredos maiora sequuntur* and concludes : \" That is all I can\ndo. You understand better tonight. Go on.\" And hence\nforth, though the encouragement is still sparingly bestowed,\nthe reproaches almost entirely cease.\nExhortations to believe.\nAn attitude of belief on the part of the person addressed\nis constantly recommended by the script. Patience is desired,\nperseverance is advised, careful recording of all that is written,\neven if not intelligible, is often urged ; but the most frequently\nrecurring injunction is to \" believe \"\u2014not to attach credence\nto a particular statement, but to have confidence, generally\nspeaking, in the authenticity of the phenomena, and to allow\nthe mind to assume a receptive attitude. Thus on April 19,\n1901, a very urgent piece of writing, trying to describe\nsomething that is to be looked for,1 winds up with an appeal\napparently addressed to me, as my initials appear followed\nby a signature : \" Cant you see ? cant you believe ? M. de\nG. V.\" On three later occasions (April 22, July 4, and\nAugust 16, 1901) it is said that belief will make things clear.\nOn Sept. 9, 1901, the converse is stated, that the disbelief\nof some one (specified) makes it hard. On Nov. 13, 1901,\nafter Mrs. Forbes and I bad for the first time met and talked\nover our automatic writing, my script wrote : \" Your belief\nhelps most\u2014that is why I wanted her to come to you.\"\nThree times more in the next three months does the script\nspeak of the importance of belief on my part, and on Feb. 27,\n1902, after the expression of a strong wish that I should\nbelieve what the writer points out to me, it is stated that\nthe thing so pointed out is intended for me personally, and\n* Trans. \"I point out to you what I hardly can; it is certainly\nincredible though true. If you believe this greater things follow.\"\n!See p. 195 for the incident, which seems to be evidential.\n\fLIII.] Comments by Script on Phenomena. 91\nit is, I think, indicated that matter of general evidential value\nshall follow later on. The words are : si modo credere velis\nquod tibi monstro, tibi nee caeteris\u2014-postmodo gentibus. \" If only\nyou will believe what I show you\u2014to you not to others,\nafterwards to the world.\"\nThe injunctions to believe continue at intervals. On June\n24, 1902, the script says it has done its part and it is now\nfor me to do mine ; to understand\u2014-and, what is hardest of\nall, to believe ; hard is that, but necessary. Some distinction\nis apparently made between belief and faith, for it continues:\n\" Reason demands belief\u2014and reason will give it. Faith is\nanother thing\u2014that comes.\" On March 1, 1903, it is thought\nimpossible that I should withhold my assent any longer, and\non March 7 the script enquires whether \" this is easier to\nbelieve, 0 you who who never give me your faith ! \" ! This\nremark occurs in a particularly obscure communication appa\nrently referring to Neo-Platonic philosophy. On August 22,\n1903, I am told to carry out a certain action,2 \"and then\nwrite for the certainty\u2014you do not believe that makes\nit hard. But Hodgson's letter will encourage you when it\ncomes this week.\" No letter from Dr. Hodgson was received\nwithin a week of August 22, 1903, but a letter was written\nby him on August 28, 1903, which when it was received\nTjy me on Sept. 7 was found to be distinctly encouraging,\nthough it contained no proof of the trustworthiness of my\nautomatic writing. However, although I was not aware of any\nparticular change in my attitude between the end of August\n-and the end of September of that year, the script seems to\nhave been satisfied, for on Sept. 22, 1903, after referring to\n\u2022certain events which would\u2014and did\u2014occur, it went on :\n\u2022\" Then this writing of mine to you will bring conviction.\nNot to you\u2014you have it.\" Since that time no further refer\nence to my scepticism was made till on August 14, 1904, it\nreproached me for not opening the ' sealed envelope ' in the\n\u2022words : \" And you will not look\u2014Faith is not yours.\"\nSo far as I have been able to ascertain, these remarks of\nthe script do not correspond with any subjective feeling on\n1The Latin runs: \"Num credibilius illud, o nunquam mihi\niidem praebens.\"\n2 See p. 101.\n\f92 Chapter V. [PART\nmy own part. From the beginning of 1901 I have kept a\ndiary in which it has been my habit to note any change or\ndevelopment of opinion on the subject of the value of the\nautomatic writing or other kindred topics. Looking through\nthis diary I find that there is recorded in it a distinctly\nincreasing tendency towards what I suppose the script would\ncall \"belief,\" that is, to a disposition to attach value to the com\nmunications of the script and to attribute them to some external\ncause rather than to my own subliminal self. But I can trace\nno connexion between the recorded dates of such progressive\nopinion and the dates on which the script advises the adop\ntion of a receptive attitude, though I think that the tone\nadopted in the successive utterances of the script shows a\ncertain recognition that my attitude was less sceptical latterly\nthan it had been at first. May 16 and 17, 1901, were the\ndates when first it seemed to me that there was something\nlike evidence for an external cause for the writing, and\non June 1 of the same year a distinct- step in the progressive\nopinion of which I have spoken was made. Other dates\nthere are in this mental progress, especially Nov. 3 and Dec.\n19, 1902, Feb. 10, 1903, and above all Oct. 20, 1903.1\nBut the script, though perhaps admitting a less resolute\nincredulity on my part in June, 1902, continues to reproach\nme with scepticism, and apparently only recognises a distinct\nchange of attitude between Aug. 22 and Sept, 22, 1903.\nThis I certainly did not recognise or record, but on Aug.\n26 I carried out an injunction of the script given on Aug.\n22,2 and the script of Sept. 1 7 said that my so doing had\nhelped, so that I am disposed to think that the congratula\ntions of Sept. 22 on my change of attitude are due to that\naction on my part rather than to any actual change of\nopinion as to the value of the script. After all, to carry out\nan injunction does show a certain confidence, so that the\nscript may have had reason for its satisfaction. But it was\nnot happy in returning in August, 1904, to its old reproach\nof want of faith in the case of the experiment with Sir\nOliver Lodge's sealed envelope. The \" faith \" that was shown\n1 For extracts from diary and statements about what occurred on\nthese dates, see App., p. 369.\n2 See preceding page.\n\fLIU.] Comments by. Script on Phenomena. 93\nin opening that envelope, at the urging of the script, was\nnot in the issue justified.1\n(III.) DIRECTIONS GIVEN.\nNo comment is needed on the frequently expressed desire\nthat I should be patient, should persevere, should note every\nthing, should interpret later, and so on, sometimes followed\nby promises of success if I would do these things. I pass on\nto what may be called the directions given by the script for\nthe conduct of the whole affair, directions which fall under\nthree main heads, according as they concern (1) the writing\nitself, (2) the publication of the writing, in the widest sense\nof the word, making known to others the contents of the\nscript ; and (3) action other than writing or publication.\n1. DIRECTIONS AS TO WHITING.\n(a) Negative directions; to abstain.\nThe directions as to writing 2 are positive and negative ;\nI am told not to write for a certain time or to write\nregularly, or to write on some special day. On three of the\nseven occasions when the script told me to wait the writing\nwas particularly scrappy ; on the other four, I had been\nwriting rather more frequently than usual before the desire\nfor an interval was expressed. In all cases I attended to the\ndirections, but I have no reason to see in them anything\nmore than a reflexion of the impression which I may very\nwell have had that the writing was poor, or that I had been\ndoing a good deal of it lately.\n(5) Positive directions; to write.\nThe positive directions for writing are very much more\nnumerous and deserve more attention ; counting one or two\ndoubtful cases there are in all 34. They are of two types,\n{a) vague : where I am told to write during a period of\nvarying length, and (\/3) definite : where a fixed day is named\n1 For an arrangement of the dates given in script and diary in\nparallel columns, see App., p. 369.\n2 For complete list, see App. pp. 371-3.\n\f94 Chapter V. [PART\nfor writing. It should however be said that where the fixed\nday is \" to-morrow \" I am not sure that the actual next\nday is intended, as the script uses \"to-morrew\" in some other\ninstances as equivalent to the near future. But in deter\nmining the value of its instructions I have naturally not\ngiven it the benefit of the doubt, and have reckoned \" to\nmorrow \" as meaning the day subsequent to that on which\nthe direction was given.\n(a) Vague ; during a period.\nInstructions to write during a period were given seven\ntimes ; once the remark is unintelligible and may not refer\nto a date for me to write at all (March 19, 1903); another\ntime the writing (Oct. 19, 1903) tells me not to look for\nevidence in the script which I am to produce \" this week,\"\nand the script so produced, though all on the same subject\nand perhaps presenting points of interest, is not evidential.1\nOn a third occasion I was prevented from carrying out the\ninstructions (Oct. 30, 1903).\nFour cases remain ; of these the promise that \" it is better\nin June\" (May 29, 1903) was quite unfulfilled, if the\nreference is to ascertainable value in the writing. The script\nduring June, 1903 was particularly scrappy and unconvincing;\nit was obtained with difficulty in very uncongenial circum\nstances : we were abroad in the worst weather I ever\nexperienced anywhere, and I was anxious about my husband's\nhealth. On June 30, 1903, however, nothing daunted, it\nagain told me to write much the next month \"here and at\nhome.\" I did what I could but was much interrupted, as\nwe were still travelling till the middle of the month ; 5 pieces\nof script thus obtained in July contained nothing of interest,\nbut a fluent and long piece of writing on July 21 and\nanother on July 31 produced perhaps the best evidence of\nknowledge of facts wholly unknown to me that has occurred.\nOf three bits of script produced \" this week,\" according to\norders on March 15, 1903, one was good and two useless.\nThe directions of Oct. 27, 1902, that I was to write more\noften and should be helped \" by Talbot all through Novem\nber\" tallied with a statement in Mrs. Forbes' script of Oct.\n1 See pp. 52-4, 297.\n\fLIII.] Comments by Script on Phenomena. 95\n30.1 My own writing in that month of November was more\nintelligent and interesting than usual, very little actual rubbish\nbeing produced ; it was in that month also that I received\nfrom Mrs. Forbes the \" message \" which drew my attention\nto the passage in Plato's Symposium? Twice then out of\nfour times the direction to write during a certain period\nproved fruitful.\n(ft) Definite : on a fioced day.\n\" To-night.\"\nIt is very unusual for me to write more than once on\nthe same day ; it has only happened six times in four years,\ntwice by deliberate intention on my own part, because the\nconditions of the first attempt had been such that I was not\nsure that the impulse to write had been exhausted, and four\ntimes in obedience to supposed directions in the script. One\nof these directions was quite indefinite.3 On another occasion,\nMarch 14, 1902, when the script directed me to \"write\neach day again to-night,\" the writing was obscure and ap\nparently recognised its failure.\nBut on the other two occasions when the script urged me\nto write again on the same day (June 24 and Dec. 19,\n1902), the matter produced was of some interest.\n\" To-morrow.\"\nFive of the instructions to write on a fixed date appointed\n\"to-morrow.\" Of these one (Oct. 22, 1903) is in the middle\nof the series described above4 when on several consecutive\noccasions the script dealt with the same set of ideas ; it\nwas on the \" morrow \" that there was made that combination\nof the Gospel phrase and the Platonic allegory which I sub\nsequently found to have been previously made by a Father\nVFor the \"telepathic\" connexion between me and Mrs. Forbes,\nsee p. 238.

Another belongs\nto the series of experiments with Mr. Constable, described\nbelow,1 and on the \" morrow \" a veridical statement seems\nto have been obtained. The third (Dec. 7, 1903) suggested an\nexperiment which could not be made.\nOn Feb. 1, 1904 I had fixed my mind before writing\non a particular point upon which I wanted more information\nfrom the script, but though there was a reference to that\npoint at the beginning, almost at once other irrelevant and\napparently new matter was introduced and the script then\nsaid : \" We had another message but this was urgent, write\nto-morrow for ours.\" The writing of the morrow was, how\never, extremely obscure and if it had any meaning I have\nfailed to gather it from the extraordinary Greek of which it\nis composed. Again on Feb. 5, 1904, the script apparently\ntried to be evidential, but recognising its failure said, \" write\nto morrow but expect no word.\" I wrote on the next day,\nand there was an attempt, only partially successful, to give\nevidential matter on a wholly new subject.\n\" On a fixed day.\"\nThe directions to write on a fixed day, numbered 9 to 27\nin the Appendix, really represent 21 orders, as two of them\nare double (Nos. 17, 20), and fall into three classes, according\nas the results 2 on the days in question were good, bad, or\nuntested. Only a rough classification has been attempted ;\nwhen any matter of apparent interest\u2014of whatever kind\u2014\nhas been produced, I have classified the result as ' good.'\nUntested Results.\nThe failure to carry out instructions was sometimes due\nto defective directions, sometimes to neglect on my part, some\ntimes to a combination of the two. Thus, when on June 30,\n1901, the script told me to count 15 days and \"listen that\nnight,\" I did not then understand, as I should have done\nwith more experience, that the listening was to be done\n!See p. 168.\n2 The number of results is 19, as twice two directions for the\nsame day were given. They may be thus classed : results good, 8 ;\nbad, 4 ; untested, 7.\n\fLIII.] Comments by Script on Phenomena. 97\npencil in hand. But on July 17, 1901, the script said that\nI ought to have written on July 1 5 in these words :\nroga quid eveniat in diem ante hunc biduum\u2014quid evenerit dicere\nvolui\u2014cur non scripsisti ? *\nOn the other occasions, through forgetfulness, I failed to carry\nout a plain direction. Two of the orders referred to the same\nday, but the first time I was told to write on that day was\nsome fifteen weeks in advance (Dec. 7, 1903) and so I suppose\nthe script thought it desirable to remind me, for on April 10,\n1904, it wrote: \"and write on the 23rd.\" But in spite of this\nI regret to say that I forgot all about writing on April 23 till,\non April 27, 1904, I was reminded of it by the script writing:\n\" Why did you forget the 23rd ? \"\nGood Results.\nOn March 29, 1901, the script was written in the morning\nat 11 a.m., and therefore the hour then appointed, ten days\nand ten hours from that time, would bring us to 9 p.m. in\nthe evening of April 8. Accordingly at that hour I tried\nfor writing and the result, though at the time unintelligible\nto me, was subsequently found to have a good deal more\nmeaning than had up to then been discoverable in the pre\nceding script. The script of May 26, 1901, was at 10.20 p.m.,\nand the 40 hours which I was to count brings us to 2.30\np.m. on May 28 ; the script so produced contained traces of\na telepathic connexion with a friend. The other four successful\nappointments were made on August 7, 1901, when, on the\ndate arranged, some success was obtained in getting the Greek\nsentence wanted by my husband; June 14, 1903, when, on\none of the two dates arranged, there was shown probable\ntelepathic knowledge of the intentions of a friend named ;\nJuly 13, 1902, and Dec. 27, 1903, when, on the dates\nnamed in the script, undoubted connexion was shown between\nmy script and Mrs. Forbes1; Dec. 25, 1903, and Jan. 9, 1904,\nwhen on the day named for writing the script produced an\nunintelligible association of ideas subsequently found to have\n.some interest.2\n* Trans. \" Ask what is happening two days before this\u2014what has\nhappened I meant to say ; why did you not write T \"\n1 See pp. 235, 264. 2 See p. 297.\nG\n\f98 Chapter V. [PART\nBad Eesults.\nThere remain four cases where the writings on the appointed\ndates contained nothing of interest. One of them is ambiguous\nin more than one point; the direction on March 11, 1903,\nto \" watch, not alone \" and \" when the vision comes note the\nday \" may not indicate automatic writing at all ; and it i\u00bb\npossible that by \" the fifteenth day \" the script meant March\n15, though the later words \"count from now\" seem to show\nthat it meant 15 days after the date of writing, namely,\nMarch 26. I wrote on both days ; March 15 brought a\npartial success in obtaining a password given by Mrs. Piper in\ntrance, but March 26 gave nothing so far found valuable.\nAnother case probably represents a revived memory and is\nin any case ambiguously expressed. On Dec. 28, 1904, the\nscript wrote:\n6 days you must wait from now and other 3. then the message\nwill make things clear. Let it come then.\nIt was not certain whether I was to write on the date given\nor to expect a message from some one else. No message\ncame. My own writing on January 6, 1905, referred to\nMrs. Forbes, but was not evidential. As the next paragraph\nin the script of December 28, 1904 after this mention of a\ndate, also referred to Mrs. Forbes, and as on consideration I\nremembered that January 6 was a day of associations for\nMrs. Forbes and marked a coincidental cross-correspondence\nbetween her and me in the preceding year 1904,1 there is\nlittle doubt that the recollection of this fact produced the\ninstructions of ihe script of December 28, 1904, to wait six\ndays, and then three. The elaborate allusion to a date\nalready marked in my mind is paralleled in the script of\nSept. 28, 1901, where a second reference to \"October 19\"\nappears in a similar form, not intelligible without some\nconsideration.2\nIt is not easy to draw any conclusion from an examination\nof these results ; in many cases it seems as if the remarks\nof the script were reflexions of feelings more or less dimly\npresent in my own normal consciousness, and this probably\noccurs more often than has been recognised. The number of\n^ee p. 264. 2See p. 330.\n\fLIII.] Comments by. Script on Phenomena, 99\nsuccesses is not sufficiently great in comparison with the\nnumber of failures to justify much confidence in the directions\nof the script ; but it may perhaps be said that more value\nattaches to its positive than to its negative statements, and\nexperience shows that it is desirable to carry out the injunc\ntions whenever they are intelligible, and to give some attention\nto discovering their meaning.\nThe direction to \" write regularly \" is not infrequent, and\nit is not certain whether this is to be regarded as a general\nremark, such as those above mentioned, to \" go on,\" etc., or\nwhether it is meant for a specific order, to apply under the\nimmediate circumstances. In either case there seems nothing\nto learn from a detailed consideration of the occasions when\nthe advice is given ; I have carried it out whenever I could.\n2. DIRECTIONS AS TO \"PUBLICATION.\"\nWhen the script makes a definite statement, it usually\ngives no indication of the persons to whom this is to be com\nmunicated, but occasionally it expresses a desire that certain\ninformation should be conveyed or withheld, or corroborated\nby enquiry. Where names of persons are thus introduced the\nwritings will be discussed in detail when I deal with \" verifiable\nincidents.\" The names are often, I think, introduced as part\nof the information which the script seeks to give, and the\nform \" Ask (So and So) \" is not meant to convey an instruction,\nbut to say for whom the incident will have a meaning. Some\ntimes the relation of an incident or the introduction of a\nname is followed by such remarks as \" Tell (some one) this,\" or\n\" Ask, ask till you know,\" \" surely you can find out from\nsome one,\" but it is not common for the script to do this. On\nthe other hand there have been some dozen occasions on which\nit has enjoined temporary or permanent silence. Twice the\nscript implies that information given is for me personally and\nnot for general use. One of these injunctions is intelligible to\nme, but on the other occasion the direction apparently means\nthat the information is still incomplete. Twice I am told not\nto tell a special person, but the description of the person is\ntoo indefinite for identification. Four times the script tells me\nnot to ask but to wait for information, twice with complete\njustification, but twice for no discoverable reason. Once I\n\f100 . Chapter V. [PART\nam told not to tell my husband something and once not to\ntell Dr. Hodgson ; on neither occasion have I found any mean\ning in the injunction. On Sept. 22, 1903, I was told not\nto say anything about the Symposium passage yet, but the\ninformation subsequently given in the script about this passage\nwas incorrect, and all that my script stated correctly about it1\nhad already been given before the recommendation to wait\nbefore talking of it. Again the script told me on Oct. 12,\n1903, not to ask Mrs. Sidgwick something yet, but when it\nremoved the prohibition, no information was obtainable to justify\nits previous advice.\nOn the whole then no special value seems to attach to the\ndirections of the script on this point.\n3. OTHER DIRECTIONS.\n(a) Negative.\nFrom time to time also the script has given me negative\nand positive instructions of a more general nature ; the\nnegative are not many, only some three or four, and do not\nseem important ; ne tentaveris novas was, for instance, \" do\nnot try new methods,\" is too vague to have any interest.\n(6) Positive.\nThe positive instructions vary considerably. Sometimes they\ndeal with particular points, as when the script attempts to\nobtain verification of something previously described : \" look\nin the paper for three days\" (March 19, 1902) or\n\"Look in paper\" (October 21, 1902). On neither occasion\ncould I find anything in the paper which bore on the con\ntents of the script. On the other hand the repeated direction\n(from Jan. 14 to Jan. 31, 1903) to look in Human Per\nsonality for a reference to a passage from the Symposium\nwas justified.2\nOnce I was told to look back in the script for the explana\ntion of a statement made, but my researches were not\nsuccessful. Two or three times the script has referred to\nearlier allusions to the subject with which it was then dealing.\nSeveral orders have been given which are not intelligible ;\n!See pp. 310-8. 2See p. 315.\n\fLIU.] Comments by Script on Phenomena. 101\nthese occur chiefly in the earlier writings, though one at least\ncame fairly late. A few suggestions concerning specified\npersons 1 have been made, and once, as above mentioned,2 the\nscript urged me to perform a specified action (Aug. 22, 1903).\nWhether any useful purpose was served by my carrying out\nthat order, I am unable to determine ; the facts are given\nbelow in sequence :\nAuy. S3, 1903. Order given, followed by statement that I\ndid not believe and that made it hard.\nAug. 26. Action performed.3\nSept. 9. Script gave information, subsequently verified, also\nreferred to Dr. Hodgson, and made its first effort to send him\nthe \" Syringa \" message.4\nSept. 17. Script said that the action done had helped me\nto the thought and that the knowledge would come.\nIt thus appears that not long after I had carried out the\norder of the script I did obtain an evidential statement in\nmy script (Sept. 9) and though at the time of writing I\nhad no idea that the script of Sept. 9 was of special interest,\nthe next script, Sept. 17, claimed that I had been helped by\ncarrying out its order. But in the absence of other similar\ninstances it would be unwise to conclude that post hoc is here\npropter hoc.\nOn the other hand there seems good reason to attach value\nto the directions of the script to \" note the hour \" of writing ;\nthe remark struck me as superfluous, for the date and hour\nof sitting down to write is always the first thing I note on\nthe paper. But of the ten occasions when the script has drawn\nattention to the importance of noting the hour or date, only\nthrice\u2014once, April 16, 1901, the day is insufficiently indi\ncated\u2014has the exact date failed to be of importance ; twice\n1 These are discussed later under verifiable incidents.\n2 See p. 92.\n3 On Aug. 26 immediately after carrying out the order I tried\nfor automatic writing, but the script had no bearing on anything\nknown to me and has not proved evidential, though obviously\nintended so to be; the script of Aug. 31 contained evidential matter\nrelating to other subjects ; no other writing was obtained between\nAug. 22 and Sept. 22 except as here described.\n* See p. 307.\n\f102 Chapter V. [PART\n(May 27, 1901, and Feb. 6, 1904) it is doubtful whether the\nmatter given is distinctive enough to be evidential, though\nin both cases the exact date would be essential for evidence ;\nbut in the other five cases evidential matter depending on the\nexact time of writing was given. Details will be found later\nas these cases are discussed among \" verifiable incidents.\" 1\nInstructions for improvement, etc.\nThe general instructions for the improvement of the writing\nor the production of evidential matter are of three main types ;\naccording as they are concerned with (1) Dr. Hodgson, (2)\nsitting with other sensitives, (3) watching for information con\nveyed during sleep.\n(1) Dr. Hodgson.\nDr. Hodgson's 2 name was the first to be given in the script\n(April 3, 1901), the first English sentence (April 16, 1901)\ncontained his name, \" ask Hodgson he knows \"; and his name\nhas been frequently mentioned throughout. Owing to his\nabsence from England, it was not possible for him to see more\nthan extracts from the writing and that may perhaps be the\nreason why the script constantly suggested that I \" should show\nhim all \" as \" he more than any would understand.\" It has\nalso expressed not only the wish that he should come to\nEngland but the assurance that he would. Therein it has\nshown itself in error.\n(2) Other sensitives.\nAnother thing that the script seems disposed to urge is\nthat I should \" sit \" with other persons, not apparently so\nmuch for special evidential purposes as to facilitate the pro\nduction of writing. Thus, on Dec. 14, 1902, it writes: \"You\nand another\u2014try together,\" and again on July 21, 1903,\nas a definite message to me from Mr. Gurney, \" Sit with\nsome one else\u2014so that you may be free for the impression.\nyou would help\u2014and you would learn.\" On Sept. 17, 1903,\n1 See App., p. 373, for list of passages, and references to pages\nwhere the various incidents are discussed.\n2 See p. 202 for references to Dr. Hodgson.\n\fmi.] Comments by Script on Phenomena. 103\nit writes : \" I cant do much more through you alone but sit\n,with others and learn to help. In the winter I will tell you\nmore.\" On July 17, 1903, it suggested that I should sit with\na lady of my acquaintance; and this it repeated on Sept. 17,\n1903. Meanwhile this lady's own automatic writing had\nmade the same suggestion to her on July 11, 1903. In\nAugust she entered into communication with me and we sat\n-together in October, 1903, and have done so from time to\ntime since. After the temporary interruption of our oppor\ntunities for meeting during my absence from Europe in\n1904, the script resumed the suggestion on April 27, 1904.\nIn these remarks the script seems to show a knowledge\nof the possibilities of the situation, as before it began to\nsuggest that I should sit with this lady I had made her\nacquaintance and knew that she was interested in these\nand similar phenomena, though I was very far from antici\npating that she would let me join her group. But in other\nrespects it showed a complete ignorance of what was feasible.\nIt was, for instance, suggested in the script that I should sit\nwith another lady, though I knew perfectly well that such a\nsuggestion was impracticable.\n<3) Sleep.\nThe third class of general directions concerns impressions\nconveyed in sleep. The actual cases of possible connexion\nbetween my dreams and my automatic writing are discussed\nlater.1 But there is no doubt that the script expects that\ninformation may be conveyed during my sleep to supplement\nwhat comes by automatic writing. On none of the occasions\nwhen the script told me to listen on any particular night\n-did I remember any impression the next morning on waking,\nso that though it is possibly true that impressions similar\nto those conveyed by automatic writing may also be con\nveyed in dreams\u2014and some experiences of my own seem to\n-confirm this\u2014there is no reason to think that the scribe has\nany knowledge as to when such impressions are likely to\nbe distinct enough to be remembered on waking, nor that\n!A list of passages in the script referring to the possibility of con\nveying information in dreams is given in Appendix, p. 374. See also\nIbelow, Chapter VII.\n\f104 Chapter V. [PART\nin my case the expectation aroused by the writing produces\nany effect on my dreams.\n(4) Reference to personal matters.\nThroughout the script there has been exceedingly little of\na personal nature ; no advice whatever has been given as to\nmy own health, for instance, or that of any one else, there\nhas been no general moral advice, and such \" philosophical \" talk\nas occurs seems to refer to particular philosophical views and\nto be meant for evidential matter rather than to have any\nethical or didactic intention. The number of references in\nthe script to feelings or preoccupations of my own, real or\nsupposed, is less than a dozen ; twice the script suggested\nthat I had been of more service to a friend in distress than\nI had thought ; once it referred sympathetically to an incident\nwhich had caused me considerable distress. As above described\nit has constantly urged upon me the necessity of belief, but\nthis rather with a view to obtain better phenomena than for\nany personal reason. For the rest its personal advice is\nentirely confined to the four months between Oct. 6, 1903,\nand Feb. 9, 1904, when on four occasions (Oct. 6, Dec. 26\nand 27, 1903, and Feb. 9, 1904) it told me \"not to worry,\"\nand once (Jan. 1, 1904) to \"clear my thoughts of public\naffairs.\" It was in the month of October, 1903, that the\nquestion of applying for leave of absence and going to Algeria\nfor the sake of my husband's health was first seriously con\nsidered. We left home on Dec. 11, 1903, and remained\naway till March 11, 1904. During that time I had a\ngreat deal more anxiety than usual and this feeling was\nprobably reflected in the writing. It is noticeable that the\nwriting, with very few exceptions, was meaningless and scanty\nduring this absence from home and that not on account of\nany lack of opportunity ; we were stationary during more\nthan ten weeks and I had plenty of leisure for writing. The\ncontents of the script were for the most part worthless, full\nof promises as to letters that would come and news that\nwas not to disturb me, no doubt attributable to the vague\ndisquiet and preoccupation of my normal self.\n\fLIU.] Unverifiable Statements or Allusions. 105\nCHAPTER VI.\nUNVERIFIABLE STATEMENTS OR ALLUSIONS.\nBEFORE passing to the consideration of verifiable incidents,,\nthere remain to be described a considerable number of writings\ndealing with various subjects, some of which purport to be\nverifiable, but. have not, for various reasons, been verified, some\nof which make no such claim. In some of these cases, a\npartial explanation may be found in reminiscences, more or\nless conscious, or in the emergence of a wholly forgotten\nknowledge. In some cases no explanation has suggested itself.\nSome of the incidents described in this chapter have the\nappearance of mere failures, unsuccessful attempts to produce\nwhat if true would be of evidential value. In some instances\nthe details are defective, in others the whole account hope\nlessly vague ; while parts resemble records of a dream. It\nseems best to attempt no classification of these incidents\naccording to their purpose or intention ; I have grouped\ntogether such as resembled one another in external character,\ndescribed them, and appended such comment as seemed\nnecessary.\n(I.) UNKNOWN NAMES.\nThere have been from time to time in the script names\nunknown to me, sometimes occurring in connexion with incidents\nrelated or suggested, sometimes found without any context.\nThe whole number is not large, and the mere names are chiefly\nfound in the opening sentences of the script, where as I\nhave said before, nonsensical words and phrases are apt to\noccur before the communication proper begins. Excluding\nten or twelve such cases, there remain twenty-five instances\nwhere names, so far without any meaning, appear in conjunction\nwith some bit of description or other indication suggesting\nthat they are part of a latent reminiscence or of an attempt.\n\f106 Chapter VI. [PART\nto produce verifiable matter. In twenty-one of these cases, the\nattempt, whatever may have been intended, is unsuccessful.\nTwo may be reminiscences ; one is perhaps a prediction, and\none seems veridical. These are discussed under their several\nheads.1 Nine of the groups of unidentified names were\npublished in a note in the S.P.R. Journal for November, 1903,\nin the hopes that they might have some meaning for readers\nof the Journal, but no light has been thrown upon them, and\nthere is no reason to think that they represent anything more\nthan subliminal reminiscences of names heard or seen,\u2014woven\ntogether by some dream-like process into the semblance of a\nstory.\n(II.) UNIDENTIFIABLE DESCRIPTIONS.\n(a) Scenes.\nClosely analogous to the introduction of unknown names is\nthe appearance of other unidentifiable matter, descriptions of\npersons, scenes, or objects, unnamed and not recalling anything\nto me. These are apparently of the same type as crystal-\nvisions2 and might certainly be expected in any automatic\nphenomena produced by a strong visualiser, such as I am.\nThe point that seems to call for notice is not that they occur,\nbut that they occur less frequently than I should have been\ndisposed to anticipate. There are fourteen descriptions of\nscenes in which persons take part, three descriptions of some\nperson unknown, and eight descriptions of objects, the objects\nbeing however only four, as two of them are described more\nthan once. It is of course possible that some of these scenes\nor objects may be eventually identified, but until that has\n,taken place they scarcely seem to require comment.\nThey are in some cases evidently affected by my surroundings\nat the time of writing ; thus, during a stay in the Alps, the\nscript described persons talking \" in the Alps not here \" while\nthe moon shone on a lake, walking \" up a long gray valley \"\nwith a \" sound of falling water,\" or walking on a hillside\n\u2022\" with patches of snow.\" In one case an incident described\nin the script was undoubtedly connected with an impression\n1 See App., p. 374, for list of unknown names and references to\npages where further comment on the incidents has been made.\n2 For an account of my experiments in crystal-gazing see\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., p. 473-478.\n\fmi.] Unverifiable Statements or Allusions. 107\n-about a stranger, probably due to unconscious observation ;\nthis is described in detail later.1 In other cases there seems\nno more explanation of the scene described than can be given\nfor the imagery of a dream.2\n(&) Persons.\nThe three descriptions of unknown persons are all in Latin,\nand purport to be evidential. These are not the least like\nanything that ever occurs in my own dreams or in crystal-\ngazing, and are therefore here noticed in detail.\n(1) On Jan. 8, 1902, the script wrote:\nOne comes to you\u2014magis tibi quam ceteris o quam bene currit\n\u2022calamus paterna lingua nee alius facile interpretatur. prodest\nautem scientiae.*\nThen followed an apparent attempt to relate an incident\nknown to my husband as a boy at school.3 Then Latin began\nagain :\nLatine loquitur Latium incolens multos ante annos nona decies\nadmodum non Romau indigena sed alienus perfervido ingenio plus\nquam matrem films urbem illam coronatam amavit. Hoc debes\n\u00abognoscere et tu.f\nThe words perfervido ingenio recall the familiar phrase,\n*' Perfervidum illud Scotorum ingenium,\" which, as I remem\nbered at once, is introduced into the inscription on the\nmemorial tablet in Trinity College Chapel to Dr. H. A. J.\nMunro, Professor of Latin at Cambridge. He died and was\nburied at Rome in 1885, but though perhaps a fanciful\nimagination might thus say that he dwelt in Latium, no\ningenuity can apply to him the number nona decies, \" 90th.\"\nI have not been able to find that the epithet \" crowned \" is\n* Trans. \"Bather to you than others. Oh how easily runs the pen\nin its (or his) native tongue ! nor does another easily interpret.\nBut it benefits knowledge.\"\nt Trans. \" He speaks in Latin : he dwells in Latium, many years\nago about the ninetieth, not a native of Rome but a foreigner, his\nimpetuous genius loved that crowned city more than a son his\nmother. This even you ought to know well.\"\n1See below, p. 141.\n2 Six of the fourteen scenes were described while I was abroad,\n,when I was constantly seeing new places.\n3 See p. 277.\n\f108 Chapter VI. [PART\nused of Rome by Dr. Munro, nor by Lucretius, the author\nwhom he edited and with whom he is specially associated.\nThe epithet is, however, obviously appropriate to any city\nsurrounded with a wall. The same idea occurs in another\npassage of the script, May 13, 1902 :\nDate lilia Romae coronatae illi urbi super montibus sedenti\u2014iinuio\npositae\u2014aspice deam! velata comam insuper sedit\u2014corona gemmata\nfulgebit.*\nHere the first words are a direct allusion to Virgil, Aen.\nVI. 883, \" manibus date lilia plenis,\" t and it is probable that the\nrest of the description is influenced by the preceding passage in\nthat poem, where in the vision of the Rome that shall be, seen\nby Aeneas, the City is turrita, \" towered like the Berecynthian\nMother,\" the account of whose progress in Lucretius' second\nBook is clearly in the mind of the later poet.1 The Great\nMother is described by Lucretius as wearing the corona muralis,\nthe \" mural crown,\" familiar in the representations of Cybele,\nso that the words \" urbem illam coronatam \" though not\nactually used by either Lucretius or Virgil are easily explicable\nas an allusion to both passages, and in conjunction with the\nphrase \" perfervido ingenio \" suggest that the person indicated\nis Dr. Munro.2\n* Trans. \" Give lilies \u2022 to Rome, to that crowned city seated\u2014or\nrather set\u2014upon the mountains. Behold the goddess ! with veiled\nhair she sits aloft; the jewelled crown will gleam.\"\nt Trans. \" Give lilies with full hands.\"\n1 See Conington's note on Virgil, Aen. VI. 785.\n2 It further appears that the goddess Roma, a late conception\nand the visible type of the Fortune of the City, wore the mural\ncrown, in imitation of Cybele, on the coins of certain cities of Asia\nMinor, but not in her representations at Rome (see Preller, Rom.\nMyth. p. 705 to 709) ; it would seem therefore that there is an\nappropriateness in the application of the epithet \"crowned\" to\nRome in the mouth of certain foreigners, as contrasted with natives\nof Rome ; this was, as far as I know, entirely unknown to me at\nthe time of writing the script; it was only in investigating the\nsubject for the purposes of this paper that I became acquainted with\nthe above facts about the Goddess Roma. But even granted that\nthe use of the epithet \" crowned \" in conjunction with what precedes\nsuggests that the person intended is a native of Asia Minor who\nloves Rome as his own country, we are no nearer discovering who\nthat person is.\n\fLIU.] Unverifiable Statements or Allusions. 109\n(2) A month later, Feb. 10, 1902, came, again in Latin,\na description of some one, but again there is no means of\nidentification. After saying in Greek that the brother is\nrenowned and that his works do not perish,1 the script\ncontinues :\nMagister sui generis ambulando dicta\u2014non sane obiter dicta\u2014\npromulgat. Quem si bene legis multa de veritate invenies. leges\nvolui tu autem insciens legis posuisti. Magus erat in populis non\nbene eruditis, scientiae vero magistrum raelius vocabis eum.*\nThe allusions to the peripatetic teaching, to the magical\nreputation,2 and to his mastership, suggest that the person\nhere described is Aristotle, \" il maestro di lor che sanno,\" the\nmaster of those that know, as Dante calls hiin, but the\nidentification is not certain, and there was no traceable reason\nwhy Aristotle should be in my thoughts at the time this was\nwritten. The rest of the script contained statements about\nDr. Hodgson, and some proposed arrangements for sittings\n\u2022with Mrs. Piper, but was not evidential.\n(3) On Sept. 27, 1902, the script made another attempt,\n.also mainly in Latin, to describe some one, and again here, as\nin the two preceding efforts, there is a certain flavour of\nliterary allusion. The words are :\nnee domitus indomita cervice post imiltas victorias sese erigit\nquern si impigre comprehendis, ecce clavis in manu tua iam est\u2014\nutinam facundior esset eloquentia tua ! non ego desum. tu autem\nmoraris.\u2014That old man eloquent.

In either case there is-\nno reason to suppose that the name of the person described,,\nwhether or not he were Isoerates, would explain any of the\nproblems connected with the automatic writing.\n(c) Objects.\nNo particular interest attaches to the first of the objects-\napparently intended for identification.

Twice, on March 3 and May 13, 1903, there\nhas been a description of a book bound in leather, inside\nwhich there seems to be a paper of importance. It should\nperhaps be noted that twice in the course of some experiments-\nin simultaneous writing with a lady in the spring of 1904\nher script contained a reference to a mislaid paper of impor\ntance to me, which was in a book, a book further described\nas \" an old history book.\" But I should suppose that the\nmislaying of papers, and the possibility of their having been\nplaced inside a book and forgotten, would be a fairly general\n\" topic \" among automatic writers and valueless unless the two-\ncommunications showed greater evidence of similarity than these\ndo.

Ill\nlast attempt to describe an object differs from the others\nin being extremely detailed, but so far nothing remotely re\nsembling either the object or the place where it is said to\nbe has been recognised by me.\n(d) Anecdotes.\nBesides the scenes, persons, and objects above described,\nthere have on three occasions 1 been related in Latin anecdotes\nclaiming to have their source in some authority insufficiently\nindicated. These also I take to be something after the\nmanner of dreams and not susceptible of explanation. One of\nthe three, a story about R. Nevile, has already been discussed ; 2\nit was written in a strange handwriting and presented some\npeculiarities of language. The other two simulate the sort\nof story that might be found in a Hagiology, or some similar\ncompilation. One, on Oct. 26, 1901, relates how a jailer\nasked his prisoner to restore the health of his son, and\nobtained his wish. It appears to centre in some way round\na word like \" Caristia,\" for this group of sounds enters more\nthan once into the story. After an allusion to the Saints\nCrispin and Crispianus,3 follows an attempt to make the\nsame sounds into a geographical name, \"Caristia insula Rhodani.\"\nLastly, the script suggests that the story which it has narrated\nwill be found in the \" Caristian legend of St. Josepha,\" and\nthen proceeds to correct the word, \" not quite Caristia,\" by\ngiving \" Charis,\" and then the same in Greek, xa\/\u00b0'?- These\nlast observations suggest attempts at the word Christian, but\nunfortunately there is no more reason to suppose that there\nis a Christian legend of Saint Josepha, whoever she may be,\ncontaining a story of a jailer's sick son than that the\nincident took place on an island in the Khone called Caristia\u2014\nor by any other name.\nThe other story was related on June 5, 1904, and contains\nno clue as to its origin ; it tells of the coming to a foreign\ncoast of a Macedonian ship with a Chalcedonian steersman.\nThe chief of the local tribe seems to have come down to the\nand the only definite statement\u2014a date said to be connected with\nthe cross\u2014is incorrect.\n!See App., p. 376. 2See p. 24.\n3 See p. 143 for further comment on this revived memory.\n\f112 Chapter VI. [PART\nshore in some trepidation, accompanied by his soldiers, when\nthe sudden disappearance of the ship and a clap of thunder\nterrified the natives, who saw in it an omen of disaster to\nthemselves\u2014an omen which, however, is discredited by the\nintelligent narrator. This strange tale is said to have been\ntold by an unnamed bishop in whose book it is to be found.\nBut without further information I fear that the bishop will\nremain unnamed, and his book unknown.\nThe giving of unidentifiable names, spurious messages, and\nso on, is of common occurrence in automatic phenomena, as\nwill be admitted by all who have experimented with table-\ntilting, planchette, and such instruments. The ratio of these\nunidentified names, etc., to the mass of the script is however\nconsiderably less than has been the case in most of the\nautomatic phenomena of the common type, produced by two\npersons, with which I am acquainted.\n(III.) \" ISLES OF THE BLEST.\"\nBesides the descriptions above referred to, which may be\nintended for accounts of actual places, there occur from time\nto time in the script descriptions of a less definite character,\nwhich seem to relate to a visionary dwelling place, a kind of\nElysian Fields or Isles of the Blest. In some cases it is possible\nthat literary reminiscence colours the description ; while in other\ncases the imagery bears a certain resemblance to sensations\nwhich I have experienced in dreams. The series forms so\ncharacteristic a group in the automatic writings that I have\nthought it worth while to describe and comment in detail.\nThough the first unmistakeable description 1 of an \" Isle of\nthe Blest\" did not appear till nearly two years after the\ninception of the script, there are among the quite early writings\nfragments which suggest that some such idea had been seeking\nexpression earlier in the subliminal consciousness. Thus on\nMarch 11, 1901, a fragmentary passage refers to a place of\nwhich the notes are : growing flowers, sweet odours, dewy\ndrops, and divine inhabitants. These same ideas occur again\non March 29, 1901, where, however, the phraseology is more\n1 See App., p. 377, for complete text of passages describing \"Isles\nof the Blest.\"\n\fLin.] Unverifiable Statements or Allusions. 113\nmystic ; the \" scented flower of light,\" for instance, can scarcely\ndescribe a natural object. On this occasion a Greek word ocr\/u.rj\nis introduced, and the writer seems dimly aware of the esoteric\nnature of his sayings, as he concludes with the suggestion that\nthough what he says may be of use to the wise, enough has\nbeen said \"for a stranger.\" On April 27, 1901, some one,\nprobably myself, is reproached with having a mind too much\nfixed on this earth, and urged in language reminiscent of\nHorace's Ode to Archytas, and of Lucretius' address to\nEpicurus,1 to let the soul soar to the regions of the sky,\n\" where all is clear, all bathed in rosy light, plain even for\nthe blind to see : but darkness surrounds your eyes.\"\nDiscouraged apparently by my insensibility, the script makes\nno further reference to any visionary scene till January, 1903,\nwhen a deliberate attempt seems to have been made to\ndescribe an 'Abode of the Blest.' The script of Jan. 18,\n1903, was produced under somewhat special circumstances,\nrelated here as possibly accounting for the writing. Before\ntrying for writing I had sat alone, as noted at the\ntime, for about twenty minutes thinking of talks I had\nhad on three particular occasions, when the question of\nsurvival after death had for special reasons been prominent\nin my thoughts. The writing is confused, and in places un\nintelligible ; it contains two or three inaccuracies, such as\ndiciliora for difficiliora, discre for discere, but it plainly begins\nwith an allusion to the dead, and ends with a description\nof an abode of departed friends. The opening phrases are full\nof reminiscences, Christian and classical ; in the second there\nis a curious mistake, or perhaps a deliberate correction, which\nmy normal self could never have made. The script has vivida\nvis animai. The phrase in Lucretius' address to Epicurus at\nthe opening of his poem (I. 72) runs: vivida vis animi pervicit\n(\" the living force of his soul gained the day,\" as Munro\ntranslates it), the word used by Lucretius being naturally\nanimus, the intellectual part of man, not anima, the breath of\n1 Script : ascripta es glebae mente vel ingenio.

It is impossible that any one who knows Lucretius or\nthe Epicurean system should confuse the two words. But\nthe modification of the language of the great materialistic\npoet in an attempt to prove survival of the spirit after\nbodily death is perhaps intentional.\nWhat follows is quite unintelligible. The scribe claims to\nhave deposited \" some such thing \" with a friend, and bids me\nannounce this to the friend in question ; something is to be\ndone with the puzzling piece of furniture a \" supellex \" ; 1\nsomething is to be sent away to a foreign land. Then comes\nthe suggestion of an \" Isle of the Blest,\" where \" gentle\nunspoiled flowers on the turf \" are apparently 2 \" drenched with\nliquid dew,\" where there is a scented breeze, a cross which\nreaches to the pole of the heavens, and \" happiness in the\nshade with many a little stream, and a fair flowered lawn.\"\nThere dwell the \" Blest whom you knew well.\" The inter\nmingling of flowers and grass, and the Christian symbolism,\nsuggest that there may here be a recollection of the valley\nin Purgatory where Sordello led Dante to see the souls of\nRudolph and other kings ; but the distinctive touches in\nDante's picture are absent. On the other hand, in the epithet\nblandus, \" kindly \" or \" gentle,\" applied to the flowers, and\nperhaps in integer, \" whole,\" \" unspoiled,\" are traces of that\n' nice derangement of epitaphs ' which would appropriately\ndescribe sensations belonging to certain of my dreams,3 where\nquasi-intellectual or ethical impressions are conveyed by physi\ncal means.\nTwo days later, Jan. 20, 1903, the script again attempted\nto describe an \" Abode of the Blest,\" saying this time that\nI had seen or read it, and ought to recognise. The last\nwords, in English, \" bliss under the shadow of a great tree,\"\nrecall the umbrosa felicitas of the script of Jan. 18, and suggest\nthat the same sort of place is being described. But a different\nsuggestion is made by the introductory paragraph. The words\nare not very clear, but it seems evident that the scene\ndescribed has some association with water. \" The daughters\n1 See p. 37.\n2 For language, see above, p. 44.\n3 See below, p. 149.\n\fLiu.] Unverifiable Statements or Allusions. 115\nof Nestor come round with every kind of many-sounding\nchord,\" they \" swim round about upon the waves \" ; there is\n\" a string of dolphins \" and an \" echoing plash.\" The band\nof \" Nereids grows faint,\" a \" vast chink \" gapes open ; 1 into\nthis the spectator is apparently invited to go, to find \" no\nmovement, a feeling of terror and empty void.\"\nThis recalled nothing whatever to my mind. Homer has\ndescribed a cave of nymphs in Ithaca (Od. XIII., 96), and\nPorphyry has made it into an elaborate allegory, though of\nthe latter fact I was not aware at the time of writing the\nscript;2 I knew the passage in Homer. Homer, however,\ncalls the Nymphs Naiads ; that or Nereids would be the\nnatural word for me to use. How the word Nestoridae\n\" daughters of Nestor,\" comes in I am unable to say ; it is\nnot so far as I know used in classical poetry,3 and the\ntwo or three daughters assigned by mythology to Nestor were\nnot Nymphs. The Nereids with the dolphins are common\nenough in classical poetry, but I can make nothing of the\n\" chink,\" and all my associations with habitations of the Blest\nwould place them in \" Islands \" or \" Meadows,\" not in caves.\nNot until two months later, when I read Porphyry's allegorical\ninterpretation of the passage in Homer, had I any idea that\nthe Abode of the Blest had been placed by any one in a\nsea cave.\nIn the next reference to this subject, March 27, 1903,\nthe chink re-appears, and this time there is no doubt of its\nobject ; \" the winds drop,\" says the scribe, \" and there gapes\na huge chink through which you may see inside if you stoop\nyour head.\" Then follows a description of the usual type :\na silvery light prevails, accompanied by varied colours and\nvaried scents ; saffron and yellow flowers, purple and rose\n1 It is possible that the first piece of writing on this subject\n(March 11, 1901), contains an attempt to describe the ingens rima\nin the words \" vrifra ingens . . . nee sine stupore,\" \" below a huge . . .\nand a feeling of stupor.\"\n2 See below, p. 290.\n3 The masculine Nestorides is common enough in the Odyssey\nas applied to Telemachus' companion, the young son of Nestor,\nAntilochus. The only possible connexion between Nestoridae and\nNereides, which seem to be used by the script as equivalents, is\nthat Nestor and Nereus were both typical old wise men.\n\f116 Chapter VI. [PART\ncolour, wave after wave rolls on ; all glows with light ; in the\nmidst may be seen those who were before \" described as seated.\"\nThe English words that follow, describing a \" flame that flickers\nnot,\" have no literary associations for me, but the next phrase\nlurida tela diei, the \" glittering shafts of day,\" recalls a well-\nknown passage in Lucretius. But the next allusions convey\nnothing to me, as I have not been able to find any prototype\nfor the \" crystal frozen founts,\" nor can I identify the \" dark\nshore \"; the actual phrase a\/cr^ wavey does not seem to occur\nin any classical author.1\nThe next account, May 29, 1903, is still more highly\ncoloured. The same general type of ideas occurs : clear (?) ~\nwater is sprinkled from a holy fount ; close beside are \" many\ncoloured flowers, their crowns already opened to the western\nwind.\" In the next words appears a touch of synaesthesia :\n\" there is a crimson scent in that garden plot.\" The leafy\nwoods sing with the varied harmonies of birds. Over all\ngoes twining the ivy \" that holds the gods,\" 3 an ivy not like\nours, but \" gold-coloured in its leafed and berried spirals ;\nlike to the supple yellow blooming helichrys with which the\ngod himself wreaths his hyacinthine locks. From every\nseparate leaf is distilled a dewy drop, like the jewel on\nthe topmost blades of grass in the first light of the sun\nafter that night before which Nothing was.\" Then with\nthe closing words in English, the script returns to its\nsynaesthesia :\ngolden birds on a golden bough, and golden songs in a real\nHesperid garden\u2014 Sound and sight and sense are one and all of it\ngolden in the golden days.\nPart of this writing is probably reminiscent of a phrase in\nthe first Idyll of Theocritus (Theo. Id. I., 29, 30) where the\nyellow berried ivy mixed with helichrys makes the decoration\nof the run of a cup given as a prize. The German editor,\nwhose book I read 25 years ago\u2014and had not looked at\nsince\u2014says that the ivy in this passage is \" not our common\n1 See pp. 286-93 for further comment on Neo-Platonic allusions.\n2 No word remotely resembling clargedula exists in Latin.\n3 The phrase capax deorum is curious, but there seems no doubt\nof its meaning.\n\fLIII.] Unverifiable Statements or Allusions. 117\nivy, hedera helix, but the yellow-berried ivy, hedera poetica,\nor ckrysocarpa,\" and his note may be represented in the script ;\nthe ivy of the poet's wreath is of course the ivy specially sacred\nto \" the god \" Bacchus. But I can find no prototype for the\nlatter part of the description, for the dewdrops on the grass\nin the sunlight of the first morning of Creation, nor has the\npassage in Theocritus any association with \" Isles of the Blest,\"\nor \" Gardens of the Hesperides.\"\nThe introduction of the \" Hesperid Garden \" is perhaps due\nto another literary reminiscence not recognised till much later.\nImmediately before the description just quoted was an allu\nsion to the word \" Orotava,\" which had been given in the script\nof April 17, 1903, \"as a pass word.\" The word had no meaning\nto me, and I did not know whether it was a real or fancy name.\nOn this occasion, May 29, 1903, it was not given correctly:\n\" You have given the name though you do not believe it,\"\nsays the script. \" Let some one ask in sounding phrase,\"\nore rotundo,\u2014 no\u2014 orotando Orotara is more like\nO r o t a n a through Tara's halls;\nthen after a direction to write next month came the descrip\ntion above quoted. In October, 1904, on reading the recently\npublished Fragments of Prose and Poetry by Mr. Myers, I\nfound the word Orotava in a poem called \" Garden of the\nHesperides,\" and after ascertaining that it was a local name\nin Teneriffe, I found Ijhat the same name appears also in a\npoem on Teneriffe in an earlier volume, the Renewal of Youth,\nwhich I had read some years before the above script was\nproduced. In that poem the Canary Islands are called\n\" Haunts of Hesperides,\" so that the association between\nOrotava and Hesperid Garden may be due to the emergence\nof a memory. But I must ask the reader to take my word\nfor it, that the resources of my normal knowledge and memory\nwere quite unequal to producing the odd combination of\nallusions in three languages written by the script on May 29,\n1903.\nThe last of the descriptions of Abodes of the Blest came on\nAug. 8, 1903, and differs from the others in several respects\n\u2014indeed, if it were not for the definite statement towards\nthe end, that it was describing where were \" the happy blest,\"\n\f118 . Chapter VI. [PART\nI should hardly have classed it with the others of this type.\nIt is mainly in English, with a few fragmentary Greek phrases\nnear the beginning and near the end. It is chiefly occupied\nwith an attempt to describe what s.eems indescribable, an\neffect of radiant blue light which casts no shadow, and of\na pillar which, standing with no reflexion on a crystal floor,\nis yet not transparent, though it does not conceal what is\nbehind. There is a strong resemblance to certain effects which\nI have imagined myself to see in dreams, a characteristic of\nthose dreams being a sort of \" tender blue radiance,\" 1 as I\nhave described it in a contemporary note. The words, \" Find\nthe pillar in sleep,\" suggest that the script is aware of this\nlikeness to my dreams.2 Towards the end there is an un\nsuccessful effort to give in Greek verse some further description\nof crystal water or self-frozen clear water, flowing from\nnatural springs, and finally there is a drawing of leaves, and\na lotos flower with the name \" Lotos.\" But all this symbolism\nconveys nothing whatever to my mind, and there is no trace\nin this writing of any literary allusion. Since that date,\nAugust, 1903, to the present tune, there has been no re\nappearance of the \" Isles of the Blest.\" With the exception\nof the three early bits of writing which may represent the\ninception of the idea of the \" Isles,\" the five or six pieces\nwhich unmistakeably deal with the subject were all pro\nduced between the middle of January and the middle of\nAugust, in the year 1903. I have no explanation to offer\nfor their occurrence at that particular time, or indeed\nat all.\n1 Some years ago, on Feb. 2, 1894, I recorded a dream of the\npreceding night, in which I had a specially vivid and lasting sen\nsation of colour, unlike anything ever actually seen by me awake.\nA landscape appeared to be \"illuminated with the most delicate\nand lovely and divine blue light,\u2014not cold like moonlight, but a\nsort of tender radiance that casts no shadows. . . .\u2014 the whole place\nwas lighted \u2014 by this diffused blueness\u2014but with none of the cold\nness of blue,\u2014nor the haze of the sea,\u2014nor the purple of an Italian\nlandscape.\"\n2 For the connexion between the script and my dreams, see\npp. 148-155.\n\fLIIL] Unverifiable Statements or Allusions. 119\n(IV.) ALLUSIONS TO CHRISTIAN RITUAL OR SYMBOLISM.\nOf definite allusions to distinctive Christian phrases,\nsymbolism, or ritual, there are very few in the script,1 a fact\nnot at all surprising, as I have never been interested in such\nsymbolism, or had any but the most superficial acquaintance\nwith Christian Art or Liturgy. The few cases described above\nwhere the cross is used as a signature 2 are not included under\nthis head, as no religious symbol seems there intended. The\nword \" cross \" only appears three or four times in the 306\npieces under consideration;3 once (March 29, 1901) in an\nunintelligible context occurs the phrase graece loquitur emptor\nredemptor cruciferens, \" in Greek speaks the purchaser, redeemer,\nbearing the cross\"; once (Jan. 31, 1902) after the words\nCrux * et praeterea nihil\u2014an obvious variant on Vox et praeterea\nnihil\u2014the script continues, Post sempiternam mansuetudinem omnia\nsuperoacua\u2014in terris, \" after the eternal compassion all is mere\nemptiness upon the earth \"\u2014words which suggest Christian\nassociations, though conveying no particular meaning as they\nstand. The introduction of the cross in an \" Isle of the Blest \"\nhas just been mentioned. These cases complete the appearances\nof the word cross.\nAn unintelligible combination of what seem to be Christian\nsymbols appears on October 25, 1902, in a particularly\nscrappy bit of writing :\nWent worth made the device for him. a fish and anchor.\nGive them both. Dont forget and Saint Peters keys.\nThis communication is signed with the S. Andrew's Cross.6\nAgain, the word hagiologus is twice used, once in near conjunc\ntion with agnus Dei, and two of the little anecdotes related 8\nsuggest a possible origin in some collection of Christian stories.\n!See App., p. 379, for quotations from script. 2See p. 76.\n3 I do not include attempts made to describe a cross for purposes\nof identification, see above, p. 110, note; below, p. 335.\n4 It is possible that the \"cross\" here is connected with the\n\u2022\"ring\" of the earlier (and interrupted) script of the same day, and\nis therefore not symbolic but intended to describe a verifiable\n,object; see p. 302.\n5 See p. 77. 6See above, p. 111.\n\f120 Chapter VI.

Lontana is\nsubsequently corrected to longinqua. On both these last occa\nsions the script was produced while I was on the Continent.\nSo also was a long and detailed but wholly unidentifiable\naccount (July 18, 1902) of a scene supposed to be viewed\nfrom above, and to take place in a church \" low with windows\nsmall and richly jewelled, not as in our Gothic.\" The general\ndescription and the words \" malekite malechite,\" and again,\n\" ico \" and \" Moscowa\" suggest a Russian church ; fragments in\nLatin further suggest that some memorial or funeral service\nis supposed to be going on, but there is nothing sufficiently\ndistinctive for identification, and there is obvious confusion\nrecognised by the script itself.

I knew nothing of the\nGreco-Melkite rite till February, 1905.\nThere appears to be no such thing as a tiara with strings, but I\nsuppose that a \"high stiff biretta with a veil pendent\" is not very\nunlike what is described and drawn in the script. I can find\nnothing else in the way of ecclesiastical head-dress at all resembling\na \"tiara with floating strings\u2014not worn,\" except this high biretta,.\nwhich appears to be removed, replaced, and removed again in the\ncourse of the service.

The phrase,\n\" with tinklings all is joyous,\" is not appropriately applied to\nthe ringing of the \" Sanctus bell \" in a Roman church, as\nthat is not part of the ceremonial, but a mere note of adver\ntisement; on the other hand a friend whom I have consulted\nwrites that these words \" bring to my mind the flabelli\n(fans), with little tinkling bells carried and shaken at certain\npoints of Armenian and other Eastern liturgies\u2014a very joyous\nsound.\" The same friend adds that the words in the script\nfrom \" Hodie sanctus \" to \" spectat \" read \" just like a liturgical\nfragment,\" but they have not been identified as such.\nOn the whole I am disposed to attribute the whole per\nformance to vague recollections suggested by the date at the\nhead of the paper. It is true that the Festival of the Puri\nfication is not a Nativity, but it is also true that I am\ncompletely unlearned in matters of ritual and had certainly\nnever thought of distinguishing between their appropriate\nceremonial. It must be remembered that if the script\nrepresents any impression of my subliminal, however uncon\nscious, derived from my normal experience or knowledge, the\nimportant thing to ascertain is not what are the facts as to\nthe ritual observed anywhere on February 2, but what my\n1 Or possibly of the Epiphany, but the \" light \" given in answer\nto prayer is to the \" faithful \" and hardly represents the manifesta\ntion to the Gentiles. Besides the distinctive characteristics of the\nEpiphany are absent; there is no \"star,\" no \"manger,\" no \"wise\nmen.\"\n2 Note, however, that the curious word ceromatico used for \"oint\nment\" means a mixture containing wax, and does not suggest the\noil, or chrism of oil and balsam, used for anointing. The lights\nblessed on February 2 are wax lights, and the word cereus, wax,\noccurs in the prayers at the blessing of candles in Roman churches.\n\fUnverifiable ^Statements or Allusions. 123\nsubliminal impressions would be ; they might, no doubt, be\nmore accurate than my supraliminal impressions, but- would\nnot be infallible. I would not undertake to say that I might\nnot have confused the ceremonies of baptism with those of\npurification and presentation in the temple.1 But to admit\nthat throws no light on the general question why the script\nshould produce such vague recollections with all the appearances\nof describing a piece of ritual observance, and in language\nentirely unlike any that I have ever known or seen. I had\nnot to my knowledge at the time of writing ever looked into\nany book containing an account of the ceremonies or prayers\nin use by any Church, except those in the Book of Common\nPrayer.2\nThe next piece of writing after the above, on February 9,\n1903, showed an attempt to refer to some ceremony of\nbaptism, but is wholly unintelligible. I quote it only to\ncomplete the list of possible allusions to this subject, but\nthere is nothing distinctively Christian in it.\nSponsor cum matertera aquam in putidillo praebet. lintello tersunt\nno tergunt\u2014fj.aprvpfl 6 irapiav. \/xeoTj\/i\/Jpios 6 Sios. ev^j^ieiTe.\nXtt\/OlS KaXAlCTTJJ.\nSo far as it can be translated, it runs thus : \" The godfather\nwith the aunt offers water in a little well (?) ; with a little\n1 A brother of my mother's was born on February 2, and I have\nall my life been familiar with a miniature painted by his mother,\nrepresenting him as a child with two doves. It is possible that\nthis early association of a birthday with the Feast of the Purifica\ntion may be responsible for the introduction of the child and cradle\ninto the script. It is possible also that the notion of a birthday was\nintroduced by telepathic association with Mrs. Forbes. I was writing\nsimultaneously with her, and I found subsequently that February 2\nwas her husband's birthday ; so that the date February 2 undoubtedly\nwas associated in her mind with birthday ceremonies. See p. 249.\n2 There is a resemblance between the words of the script and\n(e.g.) the phrases used in an account of the Festival of the Purifi\ncation given \"ex m. s. Pontificalis Ecclesiae Bisuntinae\" (Martene,\nDe Ant. Eccl. Hit.). After the words \" has candelas tua benedic-\ntione perfunde, quatenus fidelis populus eas in manibus portans non\nsolum exteriori lumine gaudeat,\" comes the Praefatio, ending with\nthe Sanctus, then the Lord's Prayer, the distribution of candles, the\nhymn of Simeon, and a procession : \" omnis plebs Ecclesiarum loca\ncum cereis et diversis hymnis lustrantibus circumeunt.\"\n\f124 Chapter VI.

QUASI-PHILOSOPHICAL, MYSTIC, OR DIDACTIC UTTERANCES.\nBesides the exhortations above described,2 there have from\ntime to time occurred in the script longer passages of a more\nor less philosophical or didactic nature, apparently addressed\nto me and intended to convey instruction. The intention is\nnot very well marked nor do the teachings, such as they are,\nseem to be those of any recognised system. For the most\npart they are vague and general in character, though there\nare here and there touches of mysticism, possibly allusions to\nOrphism, or to the doctrines of later Platonism. The iden\ntifiable references to dogma are discussed elsewhere,3 but most\nof the writings on this topic are indefinite and contain but\nfew allusions to ascertainable doctrines.\n(1) Prayers.\nOn three occasions, all comparatively recent, there have\nbeen what seem to be prayers or addresses, but it does not\nappear to whom they are addressed. On June 8, 1904,\namong some remarks intended to be evidential, come a few\nwords, asking him who shaped our hope to bestow patience\ntoo upon those who trust in him, o tu qui spem nostrum\ninformasti, patientiam insuper praebere tuis tibi confitentibus.\nThree months later some one, who though by nature impatient\nhad shown great care, is begged to remember other persons'\n1The language is obscure, the words being unknown and not\nregularly formed ; putidillo and lintello are obviously diminutives, but\nit is not clear from what they come. Puteus is a well; linteum,\na linen cloth ; linter, a boat.

It is not as it should be \" ;\nand proceeds to give the gist of the passage. The person\naddressed is not sufficiently indicated for identification, and\nthe statements and sentiments are not distinctive or appro\npriate to any particular school. The language in one point\nrecalls Horace's description of the \" wise man \" of Stoicism,\nin another perhaps Hadrian's Address to his Soul. The intro\nduction \" Ave \" and the conclusion on the word \" imperat \"\nsuggest that there is a reminiscence of the famous and\nunidentified \" Imperator \" known to readers of the records of\nthe phenomena of Mr. W. Stainton Moses and of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance.\n(2) Philosophy.\nBesides the passages referring to Neo-Platonist theories,\nwhich are dealt with later, there are 24 pieces of writing\nof the nature of philosophical disquisition, chiefly in Greek,\nthough both Latin and English are used. In seven of these\nthe language and thought are distinctly mystic, with sugges\ntions of Orphism ; in five the subjects discussed take a quasi-\nmathematical form, dealing with unification, likeness of parts,\nand so on ; the remaining twelve are vague, enigmatic, and\noften riddling in character.2\n(a) Enigmatic or Oracular Sayings.\nThree of these talk about rhythm, in the first case (Sept.\n28, 1901) with a possibly conscious connexion between pvO\/u.os\nrhythm, and apiO\/mos number. In the next (Jan. 4, 1902) it is\nsaid that \" Mousike endoxis,\" 3 whatever that may be, makes all\n^ee App., p. 381. 2See App., p. 381.\n3 ei\/So^is is an impossible Greek form ; the word is written in\nRoman character, as sometimes happens when the Greek is not\ncorrect.\n\f126 Chapter VI. [PART\nrhythmic, and I am advised to call in others, as alone I am\nnot much use. On March 19, 1902, the script says that\nwithout \" something composite \" the whole is not .\" in good\nrhythm,\" makes a statement about what can be \" harmonised,\"\nand advises me not to guess but to receive what \" thought 1\n(TO voov\/mevov) casts out.\" Later (May 31, 1902), \"none of\nall this perpetual chatter \" is said \" to fit together,\" and some\none \" versed in music or the Muses \" (or perhaps Musaeus 2)\nis mentioned. The remarks on July 13, 1902, and June 21,\n1903, contain allusions to a paper of my husband's on the\nGreek habit of etymological punning, and both seem to imply\nthat some kind of \" combination \" is required. The same\nidea occurs also on Jan. 30, 1903, when the script says that\nwhat \" you have chattered about \" and \" she has thought \"\nfit together, \" that joint action\" is better, and that \"those\nwho would separate \" 3 are not the best in this matter, though\nthere are occasions when separation must be made. This\npiece of writing ends with a perfectly unmistakeable allusion\nto a recognised theory about the Platonic ideas, that they\nare numbers, apid\/mol,\u2014and that therefore arithmetic is of\nadvantage.\nOn Oct. 6, 1903, the script opens with the curious words:\nAutaggeltOS fj Siavoia\u2014KCU Si' <xirn)v iravra SifKeKocrfir]rai .*\nThis recalls the saying of Anaxagoras,4 very familiar to me,\nthat all was chaos till mind came and brought it into order,\nbut the word used by Anaxagoras is not Siavoia but vovs, and\nthe word avrayye\\TOs is not used in classical Greek as far\nas I can ascertain ; the dictionary quotes it from Basil.\n* Trans. \" Intelligence is self-announced, and through intelligence\nare all things brought into order.\"\n1i.e. Thought, regarded as the thing thought, not the active\nprinciple, vovs.\n2 Musaeus is a traditional poet or mystic of the same type as\nOrpheus.\n3 At the time of writing, the phrase ol \\<api\u00a3ovrK \" the separatists \"\nappeared to me to be possibly an allusion to the Homeric question.\nBut I have since (February, 1906) found that the phrase is applied\nby commentators on Pythagorean theories to those who distinguish\nvovs and ^X1! instead of identifying them.\nijv 6\/iov. firo, vovs i\\dOiv avra SifKO<rfJLrj<rev.\n\fLIII.] Unverifiable Statements or Allusions. 127\nUnintelligible riddling occurs on two successive occasions, in\nLatin and Greek on Nov. 30, 1904, and in Greek only on\nDec. 4; English is used twice: on Jan. 25, 1903, to express\nin sounding language the sort of stuff that one knows in\ndreams, and again on June 24, 1904,1 where there appears to\nbe a paradoxically expressed interpretation and criticism of\nthe precept \" Forgive your enemies.\"\nWith the words \" not without holiness and temperance \" a\ntouch of mysticism apparently enters into the very frag\nmentary and unintelligible remarks of Jan. 29, 1904, the\nword \" holy,\" ocno?, being specially used of the initiated in\nOrphic writings ; this script again attempts to explain how\nunderstanding of \" the doctrine which brings rhythm and\nharmony into everything \" is to be attained.\n(&) Mystic.\nA mystic allusion seems to be found on March 7, 1903,\nin the wheel of the master which divides time into equal\nparts. And in the middle of 1904 there was apparently\nan outburst of mysticism, beginning on May 26 with some\nincomplete Greek verses on the subject of the forgetfulness\nof the dead and the impossibility of obtaining knowledge\nwithout the \" speaking of the gods,\" and continuing on\nJune 10 with some dark remarks about the baptising of\ncertain disciples called, seemingly, \" obscure,\" because what is\nplain to others is obscure to them ! A mysterious \" Etymo-\nlogicum Symbolisticum,\" formed on the analogy, I suppose, of\nthe Etymologicum Magnum, but unfortunately non-existent,\nis suggested as the authority for this strange derivation, and\nthe script proceeds in almost wholly unintelligible language to\ndiscourse about the opening of the gates of death, where \" if\nyou can behold the pure2 with your eyes you will find the\nmystics or initiated \" \" stretching tight what has been left\nbehind,\"\u2014whatever that may mean ! For v \" things there and\nthings on this side are ever bound together with a golden\nthread \" ; then follows something more about binding and\nmaking one.\n!See below, p. 128.\n2 The original puns on Kadapos, pure, and Ka6opyv, to behold.\n\f128 Chapter VI. [PART\nThe next piece of writing, June 24, is again on the same\nsubject. After a fanciful interpretation of the words \"Forgive\nyour enemies,\" the script passes into Greek, obscure enough\nindeed, but not so hopelessly corrupt and fragmentary as\nin some other instances. It is not easy to translate, and no\ntranslation can convey to those who do not read Greek the\neccentricities of phrase and form ; nor can any comment of\nmine, I fear, convey to strangers the extreme dissimilarity\nbetween this passage and anything that I have consciously\nthought or written. I can only repeat that I cannot con\nceive myself under any normal circumstances using the words\nor entertaining the ideas of this curious fragment. Till my\nattention was attracted to the subject by the script, I had\nno knowledge of Orphism beyond what must be acquired in\nthe course of classical reading by one who has always been\ninterested in Platonism, the Platonism of Plato, that is to\nsay, and not Neo-Platonism 1 or any other imitation or modi\nfication, ancient or modern, of Plato. At the time when this\nscript was produced I had not read the chapter on Orphism\nin Miss Harrison's Prolegomena to Greek Religion, though I saw\nso much of her during the writing of that book that I knew\nthat the subject was one of great interest to her and must\nhave heard something of her views. It is always difficult to\nsay what one knew at any particular moment, and it is\npossible that my lack of interest in these subjects induces\nme to underestimate the actual information which I possessed\nand could have produced if it had been called for, but even\nmaking due allowance for this I still find it impossible to\naccount for the phrases or the ideas in the following passage :\nxusia dele Crousia \/ioi\/o^iAijrbs 1j 6vyarr]p- iravSeKr\ndyyeAia o-e\/ja<\u00a3\u00abrii\/ <rtipa.<fropos- dXA' ev ayurjiaTi Tivl riav\nvu.vSfKT<ap Kal iravSiapos rb avrb Svva\/Mi fl Kai OVK epyia- roiyap o~o<\u00a3oi\nU.QVOI ol fiiefjivrjfievof oSroi yap pvrjfio<rvvrj ^paWes \\rJ6rjs f\/iar\\eia rb\nira.pa.8eiy\/j.a rb fpyacrriKov e5 uraxriv.\nwhich may be thus translated :\n\" xusia, efface that ; Crousia, the daughter is the only love.\n1 In 1901, when the script began, I had read none of the Neo-\nPlatonists\u2014not Plotinus, nor Porphyry, nor Plutarch (except the\nLives), nor Macrobius, nor lamblichus. My acquaintance with these\nvarious writers began after the middle of March, 1903, see p. 286.\n\fLIII.] Unverifiable Statements or Allusions. 129\nThe all-receiving ! message of love is a yoke fellow of seraphs : 2\nbut in a certain consecration of disciples the all receiving\nand the all giving are the same, at least in function if not\nin fact. Therefore only the initiated are wise ; * for they,\nusing (?) memory, and filled with forgetfulness, know well the\nefficient example.\"\nWhat this means, or whether it means anything, I must\nleave the reader to determine, but it seems to me to say\nthat under some circumstances (probably initiation) there is\nan identification of opposites (i.e. receiving and giving) and\nthat in the case of the initiated a combination of opposites\n(i.e. memory and forgetfulness) produces a condition of efficiency.\nWhat is the object of this condition of efficiency the script\ndoes not here say, but taking this passage in connexion with\nothers of the same type it appears to me to suggest that\none object of initiation was to enable the dead to communicate\nwith the living. I am not aware whether any such explanation\nhas ever been suggested by writers on the subject of Orphism,\nThat the waters of Mnemosyne, or Memory, play a part in Orphic\nrites was certainly known to me at the time that this script\nwas produced, and a speculative fancy might conceive that\nthe dead who remembered were more likely to communicate\nwith the living than the dead who forgot, but I have never\nto my knowledge entertained any such speculation, nor indeed\nany other speculation, on the effect of initiation in Orphic\nor other mysteries.\nthough perfectly intelligible is not extant ; SeKTup for\nthe common form SSKTJJS is used by Aeschylus, Eum. 204, and\nsrai\/SeKTTjs exists.\n2 Note the pun in the original; cmpd^opos literally \"a trace-\nhorse,\" i.e. fastened beside the yoked pair by a rope, a-epd^fa-iv is\napparently meant for a dat. pi. of the Hebrew word \" seraph.\"\n3 The phrase o-o<\u00a3o! \/xdvoi oi \/\u00ab\/iv>j\/u.\u00abi\/oi is appropriate enough if Dr.\nAdam's suggestion (Ed. of Plato's Republic, Vol. II., p. 379) is accepted\nthat 01 o-o<\u00a3oi was a \" recognised way of describing the representa\ntives of the Orphic brotherhood.\" But I was not acquainted at the\ntime when the script was produced with this view, which I found\nonly in March, 1905, when study of this feature of the script\nled me, for the first time, to consult some authorities on Orphism.\nDr. Adam's Edition of the Republic, was, however, in our house in\nNovember, 1902, and as I cut the leaves of the book on its arrival\nI may have seen, without noticing, the passage in question.\nI\n\f130 . : , Chapter VI. [PART\nAgain, on August 21, 1904, an unsuccessful attempt to\nproduce evidential matter relating to my husband was pre\nceded and followed by mystical allusions. The script began\nby saying in Greek that \" our Terpsichore \" rejoices without\nthe lyre, and the listeners, themselves songsters,1 strike the\nlyre, not with hands but with the spirit. These remarks\nare to be \" grasped and when grasped handed back ; thereby\nshall the disciples receive them though they know not their\nmaster.\" After the evidential attempt in English the script\nreturns in Latin to the same idea of lyreless music and\nsong :\nNow there returns the voice of that choir singing without a\nlyre, celebrating in a fashion unintelligible to you but delightful to\nthemselves the glory of all and the whole. When we hear this\nwe must leave meetings with mortal men and seek the eternal\ncommunion.\nThe idea of songs unaccompanied by the lyre, which\napparently underlies both parts of the script, has no associa\ntions for me and, as far as I know, no revived reminiscence\nis traceable in this writing. Nor have I found any parallel\nto it in such mystical writings as I am acquainted with.\nThe next piece of mysticism occurred on Oct. 12, 1904,\nwhen after a reference to \" Orotava \" 2 and a statement that\nI once knew what that meant, there followed a description\nin Latin of the coming to Charon's ferry of some one who\nreturned again to his comrades in the realms above. The\npersonage is not named nor sufficiently described ; he is a\nsinger whose \" more than mortal voice \" pleases the living\nand the dead, and whose songs form \" as it were a bridge\nfrom bank to bank.\" 3 Then follows a curious little bit of\nmysticism telling how, while the river flows, the banks are\n1 The script has doiScu, songs, but no doubt doifioi, bards, is intended.\nThe Greek is not altogether classical but there seems no doubt about\nits meaning.\n\"See p. 117.\n3 Two persons at once suggest themselves as the originals for the\nsinger, Orpheus and Virgil, the Orpheus of classical story and the\nVirgil of the Sixth Aeneid and the .

Where, for instance, statements are made\nin the script about persons named or otherwise identified,\nor when information as to past or forthcoming events of a\ndefinite nature is contained in it, it is at least possible to\nascertain whether or not the statements are correct, and if\ncorrect, how far information previously and consciously in my\npossession can account for them.\nOn this latter point, I can only say that I have endeavoured\nto ascertain and to make clear to my reader the extent of\nmy conscious knowledge on all topics dealt with in this script,\nbut it is of course possible that in many cases my subliminal\nextended beyond my supraliminal knowledge and that this may\naccount for some of the apparently evidential statements. It\nwill be seen, however, that there are other instances where\nthe evidence for supernormal acquisition of knowledge does not\nrest on my own impressions alone, but is corroborated by\nother persons.\n\f134 Chapter VII. [PART\nAgainst error arising from misdating of the script or mis-\nrecollection of its contents precautions have been taken by\nthe method pursued for its preservation. This method has\nbeen described above. But I repeat some particulars here\nbefore discussing any of the topics where verification becomes\npossible, in order that the conditions and external corroboration\nmay be perfectly clear.\nPrecautions observed.\nThe first piece of fluent writing was obtained, as stated\nabove, on March 5, 1901. On March 11 I copied that\npiece as well as pieces obtained on March 6, 8, and 9,\ninto a book, prefacing them with a short statement about\nprevious unsuccessful efforts earlier in the year. From that\ntime onwards I have always copied each piece of writing\ninto a book, generally within twenty-four hours after it had\nbeen obtained, though occasionally, when I have been away\nfrom home and not had the book with me, there has been a\nlonger interval. The date of the copying has always been entered\nat the tune of copying. The script is copied on to the right-\nhand pages in these MS. books, and on the left-hand\npages it has been my practice to add any comments or infor\nmation subsequently obtained which seemed likely to bear on\nthe contents of the script. Such comments are always dated.\nAt the beginning it was my practice to show the\noriginal writings\u2014in pencil on large sheets of paper\u2014to my\nhusband as soon after they were written as was possible :\nthey were then locked in my writing-table. Some of the\noriginals and the book of copies were shown to certain other\npersons; for instance, Mrs. Forbes, on November 14, 1901,\nsaw a few originals ; both originals and copies were seen by\nMr. Piddington in November, 1901, and by Sir Oliver\nLodge in December, 1901. From time to time extracts\nhave been sent to Dr. Hodgson, Mrs. Sidgwick, and other\npersons whom they were thought to concern, notes being\nmade by me as to what was sent. In the summer of 1902,\nwhile I was abroad and therefore not copying regularly into\nthe book, I showed some of the originals to Miss Jane Harrison,\nwho was with us, as well as to my husband, and she has\ndated and initialed them.\n\fLIII.]. Reminiscences, etc. 135\nIn some other cases, where it seemed that the date of pro\nduction might be of importance, I obtained the attestation\nof others, chiefly of Mr. Piddington. Finally, in December,\n1902, as it appeared that there might be some premonitory\nvalue in the script, it was arranged, to obviate the possibility\nof tampering on my part with originals or copies, that all\nexisting originals should be sent to Sir Oliver Lodge, and\nthat thenceforth I should send to him, after taking a copy\nfor my own use, each original in an envelope dated and posted\nby me, and filed by him, usually unopened, for future reference.1\nAccordingly, on December 15, 1902, I sent to Sir Oliver Lodge\nall originals down to and including the script of Oct. 25, 1902,\nthe originals from Oct. 25 to Dec. 9, 1902 being at that time\nin the charge of Miss Johnson. The next piece of writing, pro\nduced on Dec. 14, was sent on the day of its production to\nSir Oliver Lodge, and since then I have regularly sent to\nhim, very shortly after production, all the original writings,\nexcept in one or two cases where in pursuance of an experi\nment it has been arranged for the originals to go to some\none else.2\nClassification of topics.\nThe verifiable topics may be variously classified. The\ngreater part refer to specified persons, living and dead,\nand in many cases claim to give information about the\ndoings or thoughts of the living, or about incidents connected\nwith the dead, and not known to myself. But I should\nbe giving a thoroughly false idea of the contents of the script\n1 The envelopes have in some instances been opened, at my request,\n-when I wished the contents to be communicated to Sir Oliver Lodge.\n2 In all cases before Dec. 14, 1902, where the date of the script\nis of importance in estimating the value of its contents, any cor-\nroboration of its authenticity that can be given will be noted; in\nthe case of the later script this will not be done, as the postmarks\nand the corroboration of Sir Oliver Lodge show the latest date\nat which access to the originals could have been had by me. In\nthe absence of statements to the contrary it may be assumed that\n.all originals since Dec. 14, 1902, were beyond my control within\n48 hours after the date at which they were produced. In the\nAppendix will be found lists of corroborative documents where the\n,exact chronological sequence is of special importance.\n\f136 Chapter VII. [PART\nif I allowed it to be supposed that the greater part, even\nof this verifiable matter, appears in the form of communications\nfrom supposed discarnate spirits. The information is for the\nmost part stated without any colour other than is made\ninevitable by the personal form of the phraseology. \" Tell So\nand So,\" or more frequently, \" Some one ought to remember\nthis \" : such are the phrases in common use. Often the\nincident is related without any suggestion of its connexion\nwith other portions of the script or any clue to its meaning ;\nin more than one instance of the apparent knowledge by the\nscribe of facts unknown to me, and subsequently ascertained\nto be correct, the clue to the verification has been obtained\nonly by what seems the merest accident. It is of course\npossible that in some cases a clue has been missed.\nAs I have said above, attempts at rigid and exclusive\nclassification seem premature, but it will be convenient to treat\nof the verifiable incidents in classes, grouping together those\nthat are of the same general type. After describing in this\nchapter those that seem to concern my own personality, and are\nconnected with my own thoughts, memories, or dreams, and after\nsaying something of a series of experiments carried out, with or\nwithout my knowledge, by various specified persons,1 I shall go\non to the cases where \" messages \" to or about living people 2\noccur, taking for separate discussion those referring to other\nautomatic writers 3 or \" sensitives \" of any kind. In some\ncases the object aimed at seems to have been not a \" message,\"\nevidential or otherwise, to a particular person or group, but\nthe production of statements normally unknown or unknow\nable at the date of writing but subsequently verifiable. These\nform a class apart and will be considered4 when the com\nmunications grouped round persons have been described.\nThat an intimate connexion exists between the contents of\nthe automatic writing and my own mind has been profusely\nillustrated in the earlier part of this paper; it is shown in\nthe languages used, in quotations from authors known to\nme, in allusions to literary and other subjects familiar to me,\nand in many other ways. Efforts to trace some of the con-\n!See Chapter VIII. 2 Chapter IX.\n3 Chapters X. and XI. 'Chapters XII. and XIII.\n\fLIII.] Reminiscences, etc. 137\nnexions in detail have been made in discussing those \" general\ntopics\" which deal with imaginary descriptions or philosophical\ndisquisitions.1 But besides these there are a few cases where\nthe allusions are definite, and the manner of expression\nseems to show that the script is referring to my own actual\nknowledge, exactly as a third person might do ; there are\nalso some cases where the script shows revived memories\nbeyond the range of my conscious recollection ; there are a\nfew traces of reference to things thought of by me just\nbefore writing ; and there are some traceable connexions\nbetween my dreams and the automatic writing. It seems\ndesirable to deal with these four types before going on to\nother kinds of verifiable matter.\n(1) Allusions to things known to the writer.\nThe greater number of these have already been mentioned\nin describing the quotations and other literary allusions,\nbut a few remain to be noted. The script seems specially\nfamiliar with a paper written by my husband and read by\nme before our marriage ; it was published in the Journal of\nPhilology in 1880, and dealt with the question of \"divination\"\nin names and their magical interpretation among the Greeks.\nThe paper suggested that in some cases the old verb -roTrav\n\" to conjecture \" or \" divine,\" had been in our manuscripts\nreplaced by the common phrase TO TTOV, \" the whole.\" The\npaper was well known to me some twenty-five years ago, but\nhas not been specially recalled to my mind recently, and I did\nnot understand the first reference to it until it was pointed\nout to me. On April 8, 1901, in the midst of almost\nunintelligible phrases in Latin and Greek, came the following :\nsume superponenti ideam iravrl Tpoiry KOI iravra TOTTO) Hellen-\nistice Helenen cur non omnia. rides 1 et ego. sed necte semper.\nFinis coronat opus. *\nOne of the names discussed in the paper was that of Helen\nand it was also suggested that confusion between TO'TTOJ and\nthe common word rpoVo? might in part account for the\n* Trans. \" Take\u2014for me superposing (?)\u2014a shape in every mode and\nI divine all things. Hellenistically Helen ; why not all things ? You\nsmile ? So do I, but go on weaving. The end crowns the work.\"\n1 See Chapter VI,\n\f138 Chapter VII. [PART\ndisappearance in our MSS. of the word TO'TTO? in the sense\nrequired. The allusion to my husband's paper is therefore\nclear, and it seems probable that sume superponenti ideam is\nmeant to suggest an interpretation by re-arrangement.\nOn two subsequent occasions reference was made to the\nsame subject, each time in the course of some quasi-\nphilosophical but not very intelligible observations. The only\nclear point is that in each case the collaboration of some\nother person is required. Thus on July 13, 1902, it is\nsuggested that \" he himself \" is also guessing with you, vvvvro-\nX\u00ab\u00a3ef Ka' avTo?, and on June 21, 1903, after a reference to\na phrase in the TOTTJ; paper, it is said \" alone you are not\nable but with another, even if he does not act with you.\" !\nThe only other resemblance between these two pieces is that\nboth were written abroad, the first in the Swiss Alps, the\nsecond on the Lake of Lucerne, and on each occasion there\nseems reason to attribute to the script telepathic connexion\nwith friends of mine, very slight in one case, but distinct\nin the other.2 On neither of these occasions does there\nappear to be any appropriateness in the allusion to my\nhusband or to his paper.\nOn one other occasion reference was made to a phrase\nused in a technical sense by the members of a society to\nwhich my husband belongs, but conveying no meaning to the\ngeneral reader. The phrase had no meaning to me, till my\nhusband mentioned the associations that it had for him, and\nI cannot at this day recall ever having heard it. But as\nI have known many members of the society, it is impossible\nto claim this as showing supernormal knowledge on the part\nof the script. The script apparently so intended it ; it gives\nthe phrase, then adds :\nask your husband what that means. Henry Sidgwick would\nhave known\u2014Write it large. (The phrase is repeated.) That will\nconvince him that it is not you who write\u2014no other words.\n\" (the phrase) \" suffices. It is known to Gurney too\u2014and they\nwill recognise.\nThen follows the name of another member of the society.\nvYj OVK Si'vdcrai iiAAa <rvv erepw Kaiirep ov crvfnrpaa-(rovri.\n2 See pp. 183, 233.\n\fLIII.] Reminiscences, etc. 139\nBut in the impossibility of proving that I had not heard\nthe phrase, none of this is likely to ' convince ' any one that\nthe allusion was not due to a reminiscence of my own. The\nthree names mentioned are those of persons who would have\nknown the phrase, and whom I should associate with the\nphrase, granted that I knew it, as they were all members\nof the society in question.\n(2) Allusions to things recently thought of by the ivriter.\nI have throughout these four years watched carefully to\nsee if in the automatic writing, as often in dreams, I could\ntrace reminiscences of recent events or impressions. But to\nmy surprise the number of such cases is exceedingly rare.\nIn the whole 306 pieces of writing I can find only five\noccasions where the writing distinctly refers to something that\nhad occurred shortly before its production. The first occasion\nwas on May 29, 1901, when the name of a friend, about\nwhom we had felt some anxiety, occurred in the script, with\nstatements that grossly exaggerated a fleeting impression of\nmy own. It concluded with the words :\nIt is not fraud, not you, you do not do it. It is I. That's\nall to-day.\nThe writing was obtained in the train on my way down\nfrom town, soon after eight p.m. ; I noted at the time that\nat six o'clock something had occurred which suggested the name\nwith which the script began, and that the whole thing was\n\"an exaggerated reproduction of what has lately occasionally\nbeen in my mind, especially on Sunday last,\" the 26th May.\nI further noted that, contrary to the usual custom, \" I was\nquite aware of what I was writing, it came in phrases,\"\nwhereas, as I have said, the automatic script usually presents\nitself to me in words and I have no general impression\nwhatever of its meaning, as each word vanishes while I am\nendeavouring to catch the next. In fact on this occasion, my\nown \" impression throughout was that I myself\u2014not my hand\u2014\nwas writing, hence perhaps the remarks at the end.\" This is\nthe only occasion on which anything of this kind has occurred,\nor when I have had an impression of the absolute lack of\ngenuineness of the writing ; the impression of its ' genuineness '\n\f140 Chapter VII. [PART\nvaries from less to more, but this is the only piece for which,\nin spite of the protest of the scribe,1 I still seem to myself\nto be responsible.\nOn another occasion2 Italian words were obtained in the\nscript at 6.30 on the afternoon of a day on which my\nhusband had gone to town to give a lecture to the Dante\nSociety. The scribe seems to have been aware of my pre\noccupation with Italian and to have resented it. I was\nwriting in pursuance of an experiment and holding in the\nleft hand a sealed envelope of which I was to endeavour to\nread the contents.3 The day before it had suggested \" Con-\nstantia,\" \" dementia,\" and this evening it began with \" Olivia,\"\nthen wrote :\nThis is not the thing you want\u2014wait for that. Something\nsays Italian words to-night, sempre cosi bene sta. it confuses.\u2014\nIn tanto diletto d'amor. you dont know the words.\nOn Aug. 31, 1903, two days after I had heard of the\ndeath of a friend, her initials appeared at the beginning of\nthe next automatic writing, the first obtained since her\ndeath ; nothing further referring to her has occurred in the\nscript, and these initials, which were written in a hand\nsomewhat recalling hers, though not a close imitation, were no\ndoubt due to the thoughts that had filled my mind during\nthe preceding days.\nOn June 21, 1902, the script made an allusion to something\non which my husband was engaged at the time. On June 20\nor 21 he began to write an Essay 4 on a play of Euripides, of\nwhich I saw the title, namely, \" A Soul's Tragedy.\" I was\nfamiliar with the line which he was taking in the Essay, but\nthe title was new to me and interested me. An important\npersonage in his view of the play is Lyssa (Madness), and the\nscript produced the following unmistakeable reference to the\nEssay :\nNot Luria but Lyssa gives the keynote he must complete.\nIt is better than the Editing.\n!For the meaning of the word 'scribe' as used in this paper see\nabove, notes to pages 14 and 67.\n2 See p. 31. 3The word was 'Fuchsia,' see p. 168.\n4 Since published.\n\fLIII.] Reminiscences, etc. 141\nThe script is signed 1 with what are probably intended for\nthe initials of my husband's former Head Master, the late\nArchbishop Benson, but the phrase used, with its allusion to\nBrowning's poems, Luria, and A Soul's Tragedy, is clearly\nderived from my own recently acquired knowledge of the\nproposed title of my husband's Essay.\nThe last of these instances is a little more complex. I\nseem to have had an \" impression \" about a stranger, probably\nderived from subconscious observation and inference, then to\nhave elaborated the impression, and finally to have repre\nsented it in the script, but so far as the statements in the\nscript could be checked, they were incorrect. I relate the\nincident in detail, as it throws light on the way in which\nsome at least of the writing is produced. But it is the\nonly case of its kind that I have observed, though possibly\na parallel to it may be found in one of the cases related\nbelow,2 where the script recalled a dream impression.\nIn the summer of 1902 I was staying at the Riffel Alp,\nnear Zermatt, and on July 1 at breakfast I had a sudden\nimpression about a girl in the hotel, who had arrived a day\nor two before, and whom I had seen three or four times. I\nhad not spoken to her. As I sat at the table, not looking at\nher, or thinking of her, it suddenly flashed across me that\nshe was engaged, and that there was some tragedy about the\nengagement. The impression was so vivid that I wondered\nhow I could ascertain whether or not it were correct. I\ndid not know the girl's name. It then occurred to me that\nI could at least check the impression as to her engagement\nby seeing whether she wore a ring. I looked and found that\non the third finger of the left hand she was wearing two rings :\none was a gold ring with something circular, not (I think) a\njewel, in the centre, and over that one she wore a broad\nchain ring in gold, such as a man might wear on his little\nfinger. I therefore thought it probable that I had sub\nconsciously observed the rings and inferred that she was\nengaged, but that she had lost her lover and was wearing\na ring of his as well as her own.\nOn the evening of the same day, as I sat after dinner on\nthe terrace of the hotel, I had the sudden impression that\n^ee p. 302. 2See p. 153.\n\f142 Chapter VII. [PART\nthe man had been killed in the South African war, and, as\nshe came on to the terrace, I had the further impression of\nseeing over her shoulder the face of a man with melancholy\ndark eyes. That night when I wrote automatically the script\nbegan as follows :\nRicochet shot from a shell\u2014and died in hospital. He was on\nhorseback, it was two years or more ago. Frank was the name. Large\ndark eyes and a pale face with a moustache but no other hair on his\nface. The moustache not a dark brown. A tall man with a droop\nabout the shoulders.\nThere was considerable difficulty in checking these state\nments, as we knew nothing of the girl in question or her\nfriends. However, a friend of mine asked another lady staying\nat the hotel whether she knew or could find out anything\nabout the girl. In this way we learnt that the girl was\nat the time engaged to a man then in the Mounted Consta\nbulary at the Gape, and expected home in about three\nweeks. Nothing could be ascertained ; as to his name or his\npersonal appearance. But it was quite clear that the script\nwas incorrect in saying that he had died two years ago, and\nthere seems no reason to suppose that any real knowledge\nof the circumstances was contributed by the script, or that\nany part of the impression was correct, except such as might\nhave been derived from observation of the ring.1\n(3) Revived memories; emergence in the script of knoivledge\nnot voluntarily recoverable.\nPerhaps the first instance of a revived memory appears in\nthe curious signature of a very early piece of writing, March\n15th, 1901. The knowledge of which this may be a remi\nniscence was certainly not consciously possessed by me, and\nit was only three or four years after the production of the\nwriting that I found any meaning for the odd phrase.\nThe script, which is given in the Appendix, p. 342, ended\nwith the words Pollux Gappadocus ponet tigillum. The intention\nis probably to represent the signatory. Sigillum occurs else\nwhere in the early script in the sense of a seal,2 but who\n1 I have never heard anything further of the lady concerned.\n2 See April 20th, 1901, \"cerata sigilla\"; Aug. 28, 1901, \"signa\nsigillo.\"\n\fLIII.] Reminiscences, etc. 143\nwas intended by the Cappadocian Pollux ? The juxtaposition\nof Pollux and Cappadocia conveyed nothing to me and recalled\nno associations.\nBut in October, 1904, on re-reading Ibsen's play about\nJulian, Kaiser und Galilaer,1 which I had read somewhere\nabout 1895, I found that he makes Julian call Gregory\nNazianzen and Basil of Ctesarea the Castor and Pollux of\nCappadocia. Whether he has any authority for so doing I\nhave not discovered ; the writer of Gregory's biography in\nMigne's Patrologion compares the friends with Orestes and\nPylades, and Gregory himself, in his commendation of Basil,2\nsays that there seemed one soul for both, but two bodies. But\nthe allusion in Ibsen is sufficient to explain the conjunction\nof the two words and the emergence of the Cappadocian\nPollux in my script.\nPerhaps the first certain emergence of knowledge possessed\nbut not at the moment remembered by me was on Oct. 26,\n1901. The day before, Mr. Piddington, whom I had seen\nat a meeting of the S.P.R. Council in town, had suggested\nthat I should try an experiment in connexion with an automatic\nwriter known to him but not to me. I was to suggest to\nthe \" scribe \" a word, with the view of getting it reproduced\nby the other lady. I have no means of communicating with\nthe \" scribe \" other than fixing my mind in the course of\nthe day on any subject in which I am interested, and\naccordingly I did this on the 25th and again on the 26th.\nIn the evening of Oct. 26 the script apparently made an\neffort to give the name of the saint whose festival was on\nOct. 25, the day when the experiment had been suggested.\nSuch at least seems the best available explanation of what\nwas written :\nGrasp it now Graspian\u2014and another like the first. It is not\nyou\u2014placement or pleasement is a word that belongs to him, cited\nextraordinary. s. Crispin's day recently that is a date\u2014not\nfor you.\nThen followed the \" Caristian story \" described above.3\n1 I read the play in the German translation.\n2 In Laud. Bos. M. Chap. XX. 'See p. 111.\n\f144 Chapter VII. [PART\nThe remarks are not very intelligible, but whatever the\nintention may have been, it is clear that there is a reference\nto the Saints Crispin and Crispian and their recent festival.\nI have a very scant knowledge of Saints' days, but I knew\nthat these saints were the saints of Agincourt, and that\nAgincourt was fought in October. I found on investigation\nthat their festival is Oct. 25, the day preceding their appear\nance in the script, and I have little doubt that this appearance\nrepresents a piece of knowledge on my part irrecoverable by\nordinary methods : I may be presumed to have known at some\ntime the date of the battle of Agincourt, though I could not\nrecall it by conscious effort.\nAnother case in which there may be traces of a revived\nmemory, in this case of a passage in Virgil, occurred on\nFeb. 27, 1902. But the script is so confused that the\ncombination of elements may easily be wholly fortuitous.\nThe incident is not related in detail and is only mentioned\nhere for the sake of completeness.\nOn Nov. 26, 1902, there seems to emerge in the script\na reminiscence of a passage in Plato's Dialogue, Philebus, very\nfamiliar to me in 1879 and 1880, but not looked at since.\nThe passage of the script is as follows :\nTI TTOT' ovo\/mf\u00abs ; ovriva\u2014<rvvapi6fir]TW rb \\6yeiov\u2014aXAos TIS\nb o\\ov. <rv Sf OVK eva fi6vrj fvl irpo<rire\\a\u00a3eiv Svvaurcu.\nThe Greek is full of errors. a-vvapiO\/mijTw is a false form,\nbut the word intended (a-wapiO\/mfirai) seems fairly obvious.\n\\6yeiov is more difficult. The accent is not right if the word\nis to mean \\oyelov, a stage ; moreover the context seems in\nappropriate to that meaning and rather suggests some connexion\nwith \\6yos, \" reason,\" e.g. \\oyiov the noun \" oracle,\" or \\6yiov\nthe adjective neuter \" possessing Xoyo?.\" eva and evl pro\nbably mean \" one,\" i.e. one in number. It may perhaps be thus\ntranslated : \" What do you name ? No one. Let him include\nthe logeion(T) some one else will learn the whole. But you\nunaided are not able to bring one and one together.\"\nIt is not very clear, but neither in my recollection\nis the dialogue which I believe it to reproduce. Some\npoints stand out in the script : there is a question of learn\ning about a whole, and of not leaving something out, and\n\fLin.] Reminiscences, etc. 145\nsome one is reproached with failure in the elementary\nprocess of putting one to one. The script recalled nothing\nwhatever to my mind, but I was interested in the unusual\ncompound verb a-vvapiOfieiv, and looked it up in Liddell and\nScott's Lexicon. I there found a reference to Plato's Philebus,\nthe only one of the four or five passages mentioned in\nthe Lexicon which I was certain that I had read. I turned\nto the passage in the Philebiis (23 D). Socrates is proceeding\nto make a complete classification of \" things that are,\" and\nsays that they fall under three heads, (1) the unlimited\n{Platonic matter),1 aTreipov; (2) the principle of limit (ideas),\nTrepas ; and (3) combination of the two (phenomenal world),\nTO \u00a3yniu<ry6fievov ; at this point the speaker interrupts him\nself with the remark that he is a ridiculously incompetent\nclassifier and reckoner, since he has forgotten that a fourth\nclass is necessary, namely, the cause of the combination,\n(probably to be identified with mind), am'a r^? \/uu\u00a3ea>s.\nHere then is something very like what was suggested in\nthe script,\u2014an attempt to make a classification of a whole ;\na reminder not to leave out something, viz., intelligence, as\na cause ; a reproach to some one for failing in the first\nprinciples of his art. Taken together with the use of the\nrare word \" to reckon along with,\" (rvvapiOfj.fiv, I think there\ncan be no doubt that this script represents the emergence\nof a piece of knowledge once undoubtedly possessed by me,\nbut quite irrecoverable by any ordinary conscious process.\nOn May 14, 1904, another piece of information about a\npassage of Plato seems to have emerged. On May 13 it had\nbeen suggested as an experiment that I should try to find\nwhat were certain Greek words written on a sheet of paper\ncontaining ' tips ' for the Classical Tripos and known only to\nthe friend who proposed the test.2 The script of May 13 pro\nfessed its intention of getting the words on the next day, and\non May 14, wrote as follows:\njie6v<r&ev \/j.O.\\' fixf>povias 6 <r<a<f>p6v\n, OVK fcrff OTTWS pj Tavra rrj \/iv^\/ig (level.\n'Such, at least, is the interpretation noted by me in 1879.\n2 See p. 175.\n\f146 Chapter VII. [PART\nThey begin the dialogue\u2014the story\u2014Look at that. Ad-yos\nSiavoia vovs\nSiavoLa\n**\nThe words \" Universal soul is immortal \" are, as the script\nsays and as I knew at once, the opening words of the famous\nmyth in the Pkaedrus in which the soul is compared with a\ncharioteer driving a pair of horses. This myth I know well ;\nI read it for the first time about 1878. But neither my\nrecollections nor a reference to the dialogue threw any light\non the curious arrangement of words following the allusion,\nthe \"lists,\" in fact, which seem to have puzzled the scribe as\nmuch as they puzzled me. I looked up the notes in\nThompson's Edition in which I read the dialogue first, but\nwhich I have not used since. But still I found nothing.\nThe note however on the words Traa-a ^i>x^ aOavaros referred\nme to an excursus by Thompson at the end of his book, and\nthere on p. 165, in a note on the explanation of the Allegory\nof the Phaedrus I found the following :\n\" This is one of the dichotomies which Plato so greatly\naffected. We have\u2014\nTO Xdyov f\\ov rb a\\oyov\nvovs Bidvoial 6v\/nbs iiri6v\/j.ia.\"\nAny one who will compare Thompson's dichotomy and the\nscript, will I think at once admit the resemblance ; the sug\ngestion that something should be written which was in Greek\nand associated with the Classical Tripos seems to have caused\nthis emergence from my mind of something which it is almost\ncertain I had read in the course of my own preparation for the\n* Trans. \"The temperate is very wisely drunk (?)\nSophistic.\nUniversal soul is immortal; it is impossible that this does not\nabide in your memory.\"\n\fLIII.] Reminiscences, etc. 147\nClassical Tripos, but which it is equally certain that I could\nnot consciously have reproduced.\nThe last of these cases occurred on May 26, 1904. The\nwords of the script are :\nThe King and the Book. Pompilia's grave is described, read\nthat\u2014and find the words there, five words together, the child\nmother.\nThe script was apparently still engaged in the quest for\nthe words at the top of the sheet of ' tips,' which on May\n13, 1904, it had said were five in number. I had no\nrecollection of there being any description in the Ring and the\nBook of Pompilia's grave, but on referring to the poem I\nfound that she expresses the hope (Pompilia, 1. 27) that\nshe will be buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina,\n\u2014her \" own particular place,\" as all readers of the poem will\nremember\u2014and certainly her body was exposed there (Guido,\nsecond narrative, 1. 1295). Just before the description of the\nchurch her names are given ; they are five in number,\nFrancesca Camilla Vittoria Angela Pompilia, and their number\nis emphasised by the speaker in another place, \" my own five\nsaints\" (Pomp., 1. 107).\nI had no conscious recollection at the moment of reading\nthe script that Pompilia had any other name or that anything\nwas said in the poem about her burying, but it is likely\nthat the desire of my subliminal self to find five unknown\nwords revived a recollection of Pompilia's five names mentioned\nin connexion with the church where she had been baptised\nand hoped to be buried. There is no reason to suppose that\nthe allusion to Pompilia has any connexion with the problem\nset before the script, and I subsequently ascertained that\nthe required words were not five in number. Perhaps, how\never, the source of the allusion in the script of this day to\nBrowning's poem is to be found in another association of ideas.\nOn reference to the Roman Calendar1 I find that May 26th\nis the date of the annual feast commemorating the consecration\nof the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina, and it seems most\nunlikely that the allusion in the script on that very day to\n\" Pompilia's grave \" is purely accidental coincidence. I visited\n1 See Handbook to Christ, and Ecd. Rome, vol. ii. p. 330.\n\f148 Chapter VII. [PART\nthe church of San Lorenzo in Lucina when I was in Rome\nin 1891, and may have seen there or elsewhere a notice of\nthe date of the commemorative festival. But no such knowledge\nwas consciously possessed by me. Nor in fact do I associate\nwith churches any special days other than the days connected\nwith their patron saints. Investigation of the Roman Calendar\nwas suggested to me, when revising this paper for press, as\nit appeared that on several occasions1 the contents of the\nscript were determined by associations with the dates on which\nthey were obtained.\n\u2022\n(4) Connexion with dreams.\nAn obvious point for consideration is whether any con\nnexion can be traced between the automatic writing and my\ndreams, and if so what is the nature of that connexion and\nthe frequency of its occurrence. I am not a constant\ndreamer, that is to say, the dreams which I remember on\nwaking are not many. Every one is familiar with the\nexperience of having a dream recalled by some event in the\nsucceeding day, and this doubtless implies that other dream-\nimpressions not recalled by events of the day remain sub\nmerged. But such an experience is not common with me\nand the whole number of my remembered dreams is small.\nI have, however, all my life had occasional vivid impressions\nin sleep, differing altogether from the ordinary dream into\nwhich familiar persons or objects enter in a more or less\nconfused way. It has been my habit for the past fifteen\nor sixteen years2 to record these vivid dream-impressions\nimmediately after their occurrence, distinguishing in particular\na certain class of them as \" what I call my real dreams.\" The\nchief characteristic which marks these \" real \" dreams is the\nsensation of reality which accompanies them, and the durability\nof the impression left on waking ; the effect on waking is as\nthough I had come from a world of reality into a world of\nappearances, and this effect often lasts through the whole of\nthe following day, so that I have a curious sense through all\nmy ordinary occupations of playing a \" pretence game,\" while\n!See pp. 120, 143, 314.\n2 See App., p. 385, for dates of dreams so recorded.\n\fLIII.] Reminiscences, etc.\nmy real self is occupied somewhere else. Another character\nistic of these \" real \" dreams is the intensity of the sensations\nexperienced in them. I have had more vivid sensations of\ncolour and sound in dream than I have ever had in waking\nhours, and I have had occasionally other sensations difficult\nto describe : they are not synaesthetic, that is, they do not\nseem to involve confusions or combinations of two senses\nordinarily distinct, but they seem to present a sensation by\nsome unusual channel. An illustration will perhaps explain\nmore clearly what I mean.\nI do not in sleep, any more than in waking, possess the\nfaculty of \" coloured audition \" ; as far as I am aware, my\nphysical sensations in sleep, though sometimes intensified,\nremain of the same type as they are in waking hours ; I\nhear sounds, I see forms and colours, once at least I smelt\na strong odour, and the sense of touch is constantly exercised\nin dreams in the usual manner. But more than once in a\ndream I have seemed to obtain a mental impression by means\nof a physical sensation not directly suggesting it, to learn for\ninstance by touching a person what are his thoughts or what\nis his nature. The physical sensation which accompanies the\nacquisition of that knowledge is very marked and often\nvividly present some hours after waking.\nBetween February, 1894, and the beginning of the\nautomatic writing I find recorded in my notes six of\nthese \" real \" dreams, and a note in the record of the first\nshows that though this is the first recorded it is not the\nfirst experienced. Four other dreams in that period are\nrecorded as very vivid but not \" real.\" The habit, there\nfore, of \" real \" dreaming was established, and noted by me,\nbefore the inception of the automatic script. With this pre\nliminary note as to the nature of my dreams, I pass to the\nquestion of the connexion between them and the automatic\nwriting. There seem to be in all eight cases in which\nsome connexion can be traced and I propose to relate these\nin detail.1\n(a) On April 19, 1901, I had been up to town for a\nmeeting of the S.P.R., and just before leaving London by\n1 See App., p. 386, for further account of \" real \" dreams and\ncorresponding script.\n\f150 Chapter VII. [PAKT\nthe evening train I felt that it was so likely that I should\nwant to write automatically on my way home that I bought\na substantial weekly paper to serve as writing-desk. But\nwhen the compartment in which I was travelling filled with\npeople I gave up the idea and read. Suddenly I felt my\nright arm numb, the fourth and fifth fingers tingled, and I\ntook paper and pencil, in spite of the audience. The numb\nness passed from the fourth finger after I had written two\nor three words but remained in the little finger till after\nI had reached home. The contents of the script thus pro\nduced are described later ; 1 it is the physical sensation that\nis emphasised here, in view of the sequel.\nOn the succeeding night, April 19, I had one of the \"real\"\ndreams above described, and noted it at 8.30 a.m. on April 20.\nIn this dream, as once some years before,2 the sense of reality\nwas apparently produced by a very marked sensation of touch.\nA previous feeling of uncertainty was removed by the con\ntact between my right arm from wrist to elbow and the\nleft arm of a person in my dream. I also had in this dream,\nas I have had on other occasions, the impression of com\nmunicating with my companion without words, though words\nwere passing at the time between us on other subjects. So\nstrong was the feeling in my arm produced by this dream-\ntouch that I woke \" almost thinking I still felt it,\" and was\nsufficiently awake to investigate whether there was any\nphysical sensation in my arm to account for this impression.\nBut there was none. I slept again and through that later\nsleep as throughout the next day, I continued conscious\nof the persistency of the impression of reality attained in\nthe dream, which is the never failing mark of this type of\ndream.\nIt is possible that there was some connexion between\nthe sensation of numbness in the forearm and fingers preceding\nthe impulse to write automatically on the evening of April\n19, and the vivid sensation of information conveyed by means\nof contact with almost precisely the same part of the arm\nand hand in the dream on the following night. But it must\nbe noted that a similar vivid sensation of touch in the same\narm has twice before in dreams seemed to me to convey\n!See p. 195. 2See App., p. 386.\n\fuu.] Reminiscences, etc. 151\nthe knowledge of something uncommunicated and perhaps\nincommunicable in any other way, and that these two earlier\ndreams occurred respectively in 1894 and 1898, long before\nI had succeeded in obtaining automatic writing.\n(6) On May 8, 1901, I wrote automatically, beginning at\n10 p.m., and the script terminated with a suggestion that\nother automatic phenomena were being produced elsewhere\nat the same hour.\nIn my note-book I recorded on May 10, 1901, 9 a.m.,\nthat on the preceding night I had dreamt that Mrs. Thompson\nwas obtaining automatic phenomena ; I had woke and dreamt\nagain to the same effect, and this though at the time I\nknew that she was not giving sittings. I had therefore no\nreason whatever to attach any value to the suggestion in the\ndream : it was recorded because I was keeping a careful\nrecord of all impressions in any way likely to throw light on\nthe production of automatic phenomena. The dream may have\nbeen due to a development of the idea expressed in the script\nof May 8, that communications were being elsewhere produced\nat the same time that my script was being written.\nHowever this may be, there seems to have been a further\ndevelopment in my next piece of script on May 11, which\ndefinitely stated that Mrs. Thompson would have news to\ngive in the next few days.\nThere seems no doubt as to the connexion here between my\nautomatic writing and my dreams, as the dream impression\nseems to furnish the link between the two statements in the\nscript.\nThe most interesting point in this case is that the infor\nmation thus obtained was correct.1\n(c) In the third of these cases there seems to have been\na direct influence by the script upon my dreams. On June 3rd,\n1901, the script concluded its remarks thus :\nPone stilum per aliquot dies\u2014signa dabo cum rescribere\n,debes. In somniis veritas\u2014expecta.*\nThis was followed by an attempt at signature.\n* Trams. \"Put down your pen for a few days; I will give a sign\n,when you are to write again (?). In dreams is truth\u2014wait.\"\n!See p. 207.\n\f152 Chapter VII. [PART\nI took this to mean that I was not to write again till I\nreceived some indication, and I expected that indication to-\ntake the form of some physical impulse to the hand such as\nI had had on April 19, 1901, or at least a very strong desire\nto write, such as I had had on more than one occasion pre\nviously (May 11, May 27). I thought the remark about\ntruth in dreams referred to my sensations of reality in certain\ndreams, and might mean that instead of getting automatic\nwriting I was to look out for an impression in a dream. I\nmention this to show what were my expectations at the\ntime.\nFor some days after June 3 I made no attempt to write,\nbut on the night of June 13 I had a ridiculous dream, to\nthe effect that I received an \" automatic telegram \"\u2014whatever\nthat may be !\u2014telling me that I might begin writing again.\nI then saw that the words of June 3 were quite capable of\nbeing interpreted to mean that the signal for the resumption of\nwriting would come in a dream and I have little doubt that\nsuch an unconscious interpretation helped to produce the\ndream.\n(d) In another case, it seems as if a state of mind\nproduced in me by the script were distinctly reflected in\na dream which occurred on the succeeding night. On November\n22, 1901, and again on Nov. 25, the automatic script pur\nported to come from Mr. Francis Maitland Balfour of Trinity\nCollege.1 I was disturbed at the occurrence in my script of\nsupposed messages requiring verification from my friends, as\nI believed that the greater part of the writing was produced\nby some part of my own mind over which I had little or\nno control.\nOn the evening of November 25, my mind was constantly\noccupied with the thought of how, without stopping the phe\nnomena, I could be sure of preventing myself from manufactur\ning messages, and how I could hope to obtain any sort of\nguarantee that they were genuine. That night I had a dream\ndirectly bearing on this question, and in the dream I recognised\nthe impression given as being an answer to my difficulty as to\ndetermining the source of the statements in the script. The\ndetails are not very clear and certainly not interesting ; what is.\n1 See also pp. 26, 225.\n\fLin.] Reminiscences, etc. 153\ncertain is that on the night after the recurrence of the un\ncomfortable condition of mind produced by the contents of\nthe script, I had a dream which endeavoured to persuade me\nof the genuineness of my automatic phenomena, and so to\nremove that condition of mind.\n(e) In the next case the memory of an otherwise forgotten\ndream seems to have been recalled by the script. The case\nhas no other interest, but is the only instance of the kind,\nand is therefore related here.\nOn March 31, 1902, the script, produced at 11.15 a.m.,\ncontained the following words :\nThe red postbox was in a bird's eye view\u2014last night.\n36 was the number 6x6 and the VI Aeneid\u2014look at the line\nNo. XXXVI1\nOn reading this over I remembered that the preceding night\nI had dreamt that I was trying experiments in the thought-\ntransference of diagrams and saw something round with a tail\nbelow, and red ; I was told in the dream that I was not\nunsuccessful, as the object was a red pillar-box. I thought\nmy object very unlike a pillar-box, and asked to see the\npillar-box in question. I then found that it was looked at\nfrom above, and that the door in the side was open, so that\nthe only lines represented were a circle and a semicircle\nattached below, thus *^J. In the dream also, so it seemed\nto me, were mixed up the numbers 36 and 6, and Aeneid VI.\nIt is of course possible that no such dream occurred, but\nthat the remarks in the script produced a pseudo-memory.\nBut that is not my impression, and in view of the differences\nbetween the script and the dream I am disposed to think\nthat I did actually dream something of the sort described,\nand that my subliminal self continued on the same lines\nwhen it got the chance of writing automatically.\nNeither the script nor the dream seem to have been of\nany value and the line in the Sixth Aeneid (Aen. VI. 36)2 is\nmeaningless without its context.\n1See App., p. 349, for complete script.\n2 Aen. VI. 36. \"Deiphobe Glauci, fatur quae talia regi.\" (Dei-\nphobe daughter of Glaucus, who thus spoke to the king.)\n\f154 Chapter VII. [PART\n(\/) The next case of connexion between the script and\ndreams occurred in the early summer of 1902, at the time\nthat I was going abroad. The circumstances are somewhat\nsimilar to those in case c, and may quite possibly have been\nproduced by an association of ideas, as we were going again\nat the same time of year to the same place in Switzerland.\nOn May 31, 1902, the script said \"Later not here in the\nmountains shall come the news that helps,\" and at the end\nof the communication it told me to \" dream and remember\u2014\nthe blue colour that you saw\u2014see again to-night, alone in\nsleep.\" I had no impression of colour in sleep that night,\nand for some time after this I made no attempt to obtain\nwriting since I felt, as I have occasionally done at other times,\nas if the faculty had left me. On June 17, 1902, at\nLausanne, I had a feeling that the power to write was\nreturning, and on June 20 \"in the mountains \" some suggestion\nwas made in dream about obtaining automatic phenomena on\nTuesday or Wednesday.\nScript was obtained on the day suggested,1 after an impulse\nto write, so that a remark in the script of May 31 apparently\nproduced impressions in sleep on June 17 and June 20, and\nin its turn the impression in sleep of June 20 produced an\nimpulse to write on June 24.\n(g) The next attempt at a connexion between the script\nand my dreams was in the summer of 1903 when I was\nagain in Switzerland. It was a complete failure. On June\n2 1 the script wrote : \" Listen to night in the silence it will\ncome to you.\" I had a dream on the evening of June 21,\nbut it was of a perfectly trivial and ordinary character and\nhad no connexion with anything in the script.\n(h) The last case is quite unlike any of those that have\nbeen described ; there seems to have been an attempt in a\ndream to interpret what had been written long before in\nthe script and not understood. The incident is complicated,\nand not easily comprehensible without elaborate explanations.\nIt is therefore not related here, and I need only say that my\ndreaming mind showed a familiarity with details in the auto\nmatic script of some three years before, and an ingenuity of\ninterpretation far exceeding that of my conscious self. For\n1 See p. 302.\n\fLIIL] Reminiscences, etc. 155\nthat conscious self had altogether failed to see what, after the\ndream, seemed likely enough to have been the meaning of\nthe script.\nThis completes the account of all cases where there seems\nto have been any connexion between the script and my\ndreams : the total number is not large, but neither is the\ntotal number of dreams remembered in the morning or thought\nworth recording. Still, with all allowance made for that, it\ndoes not seem as if any definite or regular connexion between\nmy dreaming mind and my writing hand could be established,\nthough on some occasions they do appear to have been in\ncommunication.\n\f156 Chapter VIII. [PART\nCHAPTER VIII.\nEXPERIMENTS IN CONVEYING INFORMATION TELEPATHICALLY\nTO THE SCRIPT.\nIN the course of the period during which I have obtained\nautomatic writing a certain number of experiments have been\ntried, with the object of seeing whether information unknown\nto me could be conveyed to me by means of telepathy,\nclairvoyance, or other unrecognised channel. Two of these\nexperiments were performed without my knowledge, one by\nmy husband, one by a friend who had heard of the experi\nment carried out by my husband. The latter was completely\nunsuccessful ; the former, though not successful in all points,\nshows I think beyond dispute that the script was influenced\nby the desire of my husband, unknown to me, that it should\nproduce a certain phrase consisting of three Greek words,\nfor it seems to have made a large number of attempts\u2014with\nvarying success\u2014to reproduce those words. The circumstances\nare described below.\n(A) EXPERIMENTS WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE.\n(1) A. W. Verrall. In April, 1901, soon after the inception\nof my automatic writing, my husband decided, without giving\nme any hint of his intention, to try an experiment in\nthought-transference. He wrote down the three Greek words\n\/movoTTto\\ov e? aw,1 \" to the one-horse dawn,\" a phrase con\nnected with an incident of his undergraduate days about\nthirty years before. The incident was never known, as far\nas we are aware, to me, and was only known at the time\nof its occurrence to the two or three friends immediately\nconcerned and himself. When he related the incident to me\nin October, 1902, his recollections were as follows: that during\n!Eur. Or. 1004.\n\fLIII.] Experiments in Telepathy. 157\nan examination he and some other men met on the Senate\nHouse steps after a translation paper in which had been set\na passage from the Orestes of Euripides containing the above words;\nthat some one asked \"What on earth is the meaning of \/movo-\nTria\\ov es aS> ? that some one else answered \" a one-horse dawn,\"\nand \" one-horse \" being a current slang expression at the time\nthere was a laugh and the subject dropped ; that Dr. A. T.\nMyers and Mr. Edmund Gurney1 were members of the group\nof friends. I have since ascertained that the passage was set\nfor translation in the Classical Tripos of 1873, the year of\nmy husband's degree. Dr. Myers was a fellow-candidate with\nmy husband, but Mr. Gurney was not. The examination took\nplace in the Senate House.\nThe words occur in a passage describing a disturbance of\nnatural phenomena, the reversal of the movement of the sun,\nand the epithet yuoi\/oVcoXo? is usually taken to refer to the\none-horse car of Dawn as distinguished from the four-horse\nchariot of the Sun ; in my husband's opinion, however, the\nword may mean no more than \/JLOVOS, alone or solitary, the\nlatter part of the word, -TrioXo?, being possibly connected with\nTTwXeo\/uai, \" to wander.\"\nThis experiment was devised by my husband in April,\n1901, and the three words were then written down, with\nthe intention of seeing whether my hand would make any\nattempt to reproduce his thought. The paper on which the\nwords were written was put into an envelope, placed by him,\nto the best of his belief, in the drawer of his writing-table,\nwhere he is in the habit of keeping papers. The drawer is\nnot used by any one but himself.2 He had not made, he\ntells me, any experiment before ; and he said nothing about\nany experiment either at the time of its beginning, or at\nany time during the continuance of what are hereafter\nnoted as allusions to it in the script.\nThe first apparent allusion 3 to such an experiment occurred\n!Mr. Gurney died in 1888, and Dr. Myers in 1894.\n2 The note of this experiment was mislaid or lost; it could not\nbe found when the experiment was ended and the words told to me.\n3 ' Apparent,' that is, in the light of those which followed ; at the\ntime, as will immediately be seen, my husband did not recognize\nit as an allusion.\n\f158 Chapter VIII. [PART\non June 16, 1901, when these words appeared, \"Five stars\nin the east that is not right. Cant you understand\u2014\" followed\nlater hy the observation : \" There is no hurry, show it all\nto your husband.\" I attached no special importance to this\ninjunction. Since March 5, when the writing began, there\nhad been four references in all to my husband by his initials\nA. W. V., and on June 3 the script had expressed a feeling\nthat it was difficult to convince a sceptic, but that it could\n\" soon give a plain message for him who runs not 1 to read\u2014\nA. W. V. knows better than you.\" I was in the habit of\nshowing my script to my husband and he saw this writing\nof June 16 but did not recognise in it any allusion to hi&\nthree words. We were temporarily separated towards the end\nof July, 1901. On August 1, I showed him the writing of\nJuly 3 1 , and he told me that \" it interested him.\" This I\nnoted at the time, as I did all such observations, but neither\nthen nor at any subsequent date up to October, 1902, did\nI have the least idea that he was looking for any particular\nwords in my script, or that he had himself set my hand a\ntask ; the extracts which were subsequently seen to refer\nto this incident were parts of larger wholes, and though he\ntold me from time to time by way of encouragement that\nthere was \" a point of interest \" to him in that day's writing,\nor that he \" understood what the script meant,\" I never had\nthe least idea to what he was referring. I was aware that\nthere was something in my writing which he was observing\nwith interest, and I noted all his observations at the time.\nBut it was not till more than a year later, Oct. 17, 1902,\nwhen it seemed clear that no further attempts to produce\nthe words would be made, that I heard from him what he\nhad been looking for and that he had made an experiment.\nWhat first made my husband think that the script might\nbe on the track of his three words was the appearance in\nthe script of July 31, 1901, of the following phrases:\nlongaevus senex barba alba fiovo\\i,T<\u00bbvos sine apparatu . . . albi-\npannosus est. signifer ille.\nThe words purport to describe an \" aged man with a white\nbeard, one-garmented without ornament . . . white-garmented\n1 My husband was lame from rheumatism in the knees.\n\fLIII.] Experiments in Telepathy. 159\nis he : the standard-bearer.\" But in the curious word, not\nextant, HOVO-XITWVOS, he saw a possible attempt at \/j.ovoTrw\\ov.\nIn connexion with this, the repetition of the Latin word for\nwhite, alba, which is also a late Latin word for \" dawn \"\n(French aube), seemed also possibly suggestive. The sequel,\nas will be seen, confirmed this. The writing of July 31\nconcluded with the remark : \" In August you will know more\u2014\nwait. Don't ask. write often.\"\nI wrote on Aug. 6, 7, and 10, but on none of these days\nwas there any reference to the three words. On Aug. 13,\nhowever, the script made another twofold attempt at the\nidea of \" dawn \" by the juxtaposition of a crowing cock and\na motto about dawn. After this it made persistent efforts,\nsome attempt at either sense or sound of the three words\nappearing in each of the next fourteen writings of the script,\nthat is, on all the days when writing was obtained between\nAug. 13 and Sept 20, fifteen in all. At the time, and until\nI was told of the experiment in October, 1902, I had no\nnotion of their significance. It will be easily realised by any\none who will consider the fragmentary nature of those allusions\nand the multiplicity of ways in which now the sense, now\nthe sound, and now the appearance of the words was indicated,\nthat it was not possible for a person ignorant of the nature\nof the problem that had been set, not even knowing that\nthere was a problem, to interpret the allusions or even to\nconnect them. I had no idea that there was anything in\nquestion so definite as a sentence, and was astonished on\nlooking back through the writing to see how near the script\nhad come to the truth.\nFrom the detailed comment1 that follows, it will be seen\nthat the script attempts to reproduce both the word and the\nsense : it tries for the notions of \" dawn \" and of \" one-horse \"\nor \" solitary \" ; it also attempts to reproduce the sound and\nthe appearance both of the individual words and of the\nwhole sentence of three words. There are perhaps also\n1 In the Appendix (p. 387) will be found all passages in the script\nwhich appear to relate to this incident, and also a summary under\nheads of the various attempts according as they seem to aim at\nrepresenting the sense, the sound, or the appearance of the three\nwords that made the subject of the experiment.\n\f160 Chapter VIII. [PART\nreferences to the incident which suggested the phrase to my\nhusband ; 1 and there are many appeals to him.\nThe first attempt seems to have beea directed at the\nsense ; on June 1 6 appears the first suggestion of \" dawn \"\nin the words \"five stars in the east,\" said immediately not\nto be right, and followed by the remark that the incredible\nbird would return within six months. Another allusion was\nmade to dawn on July 4, and on July 31, as we have seen\nabove, appeared, in HOVO-XITUIVOS, an approach to the words.\nThe script of July 31 promised further information in\nAugust, but three writings intervened before it returned to the\nsubject. Then, on August 13, it again recurred to the subject\nof dawn by writing of a \" cock, a crested cock that crows,\"\nwhich it recognised as \" an emblem\u2014not a real bird \" and\nactually interpreted as a symbol of morning, for it added :\n\" heraldic\u2014with a motto\u2014cano canam albam.\" *\nOn Aug. 16, after saying that there was something to\nexpound for me and another (e\u00a3rjyt]cris Trapa a-ol KOI aXXw rivl)\nit went on :\neasier and easier though you do not know. The cock is inside\na circle perhaps a coin. Try for the words again.\nThen came further efforts at words including \" albicapillus and\nalbipannosus,\" and a description of some one in long trailing\ndraperies of white carrying a long stick in one hand, a small\nbox in the other, and \" going towards the east \" :\nAWV will understand this\u2014I think of him when I say it\u2014you\ndo not know.\nMy husband naturally did understand very well, as he was\nactually looking for reference to words of which ' going towards\nthe east ' is a fair translation.\nOn Aug. 20 a reference to a wearer of white drapery, with\nthe words \" a strong sweet scent trails behind \" suggests an\nemergence\u2014in the form of a priest approaching an altar\u2014\nof another way of suggesting the east. Then, after confused\n* Trans. \" I sing the white dawn.\" Here it seems certain that\nalbam represents aube.\n1 The script seems to show knowledge of something not remembered\nby him at the time of the experiment, though known to him in\nthe past; see p. 163.\n\fLin.] Experiments in Telepathy. 161\nreferences to my husband's old school, Wellington College, it\nends with what may be an allusion to the circumstances of\nthe incident :\nThe long room with the many windows is near this hot room\n\u2014he was outside\u2014how plain it seems to me I but you dont know.\nArthur can tell you.1\nThe strangely involved and embarrassed process of the thought\nis well illustrated in the script of Aug. 23, for frantic efforts are\nmade to get at another word which eventually turns out to be\n\" Chanticlere,\" merely another way of saying \" cock \" which has\nalready been quite plainly said.\nOn August 2 8 the notion of the \" altar \" seems clearly\nto emerge ; the cock reappears again as an emblem ; it is\nseen that words or writing is required ; reference is made\nto my husband, not by his full initials but by the first two,\nwhich have always been used to designate him by some of his\nundergraduate friends : \" Ask A.W. he will recognise this.\"\nThere seems some confusion here as to what writing is wanted.\nSome time before, we had been reminded by a phrase in the\nscript of a Latin inscription2 which my husband had made for a\nfriend, and the effort to get at words interesting my husband\nseems to have produced some recollection of this other incident.\nThe drawing of a sundial in the script is at once followed by\nthe words \" in the east to the daylight,\" again reproducing\nthe sense of the three words.\nThe next day, Aug. 29, efforts seem to have been directed\nrather to the letters, and appearance and sound of the\nwords, than to the sense, though the notion of the dawn is\nnot forgotten. But the middle word is plainly produced.\nAfter saying that the shape of the letters is archaic, and\ndrawing three archaic forms of Greek letters, in illustration,\nit produces the word \" es,\" with the archaic s, in connexion with\n'Arthur is my husband's name, but as the name here is not\nwritten in my ordinary hand, and he is elsewhere\u2014and in this\nvery script\u2014referred to by his initials, I do not believe that the\nallusion is to him. See also script of Oct. 6, 1901, where 'Arthur'\nis clearly distinguished from A. W. V., and there clearly refers to\nsome one dead ; in that passage probably, and in this possibly, the\nallusion is to Dr. Arthur Myers.\n2 See below, p. 280, for an account of allusions to an inscription.\nL\n\f162 Chapter VIII.

But in the spring of 1905, when I was writing\nthis paper and had ascertained that the passage of the Orestes\nwas set in the last paper of the Classical Tripos of 1873, it\noccurred to me to look at the other papers set in that year,\nand I found that the subject for Latin Hexameters in the\nTripos of 1873 was the passage from Comus, ending,\n\"And yet more med'cinal is it than that moly\nWhich Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave.\"\nIt appears that the combination of the letters m o I, pro\nduced in the effort to give the word iUoi\/oVcoXoi\/, had, by\nsome association of ideas, suggested a reminiscence of another\npaper in the same Tripos examination.

[PART\nBut it is strange to find that my script seems to have\nregistered here not only an existing mental impression of my\nhusband's, but also a forgotten past impression, once closely\nassociated with the first.\nOn Sept. 1 2 the script recurred to \" Pye,\" and apparently\ntried to give \" another clue,\" but without much success.\nOn Sept. 14 it played round the sounds and the notions\nof \" planet \" and \" solitary,\" and came exceedingly near to\nfiovoTTia\\ov in sense, when it wrote : illustre vagatur caelo sine\ncomite, \" bright it wanders in the sky uncompanioned \"\u2014a\nsentence which is in fact a precise and correct exposition in\nLatin of \/u.ovoTrui\\ov (au>), lonely-wandering (dawn), according to\nthe interpretation preferred by my husband.\nOn Sept. 18 it got vaguely hold of the only idea not\nhitherto reproduced, namely, that of \" horse \" in the ordinary\nview of the meaning of \/i.ovoTrw\\os, \" having one horse.\" The\nword ( ~\" *J *- T~7 \"77\" (j [ , which it described as being en\ngraved on something is suggestive of CWTTTTO?, \"of goodly horses.\"1\nOn this occasion, while I was writing in one room, my husband,\nsitting in another, definitely fixed his mind on the notion\nof ' horse,' which had so far been conspicuously absent. This\nwas unknown to me at the time and wholly unsuspected ; I\nwas somewhat startled to find when he told me, on seeing\nthe script of Sept. 18, that he had been fixing his mind on\nsomething, as I had had no idea that my writing had in any\nsense been the subject of experiment.\nAfter this no further light was obtained ; I now knew that\nthere was a thing wanted by my husband and that he had\nbeen trying experimentally to obtain it ; whether this know\nledge on my part had any effect I cannot tell, but the next\nscript had very little to say on the subject beyond a suggestion\nthat the words were not those of the ostensible writer, but\nof some doctor, apparently not a doctor of letters ; I was to\nask A.W.V.\n1 It has been suggested that the letters in the script represent not\nivnnros, but \u00abis iWos, 'one horse.' The second symbol in the script\nlooks like a y, but is plainly made of two strokes, and might be a\nGreek i, followed by a badly made Greek s. In that case, the script in\n\u00ab?s \"TTTTOS 'one horse ' has come very near the common meaning of\n\fLIII.] Experiments in Telepathy. 165\nOn Sept. 28 I had automatic writing with no reference\nwhatever to these words or to my husband,\u2014a thing that\nhad not occurred since August 10, and the next writing on\nOct. 6 contained the words \" But A.W.V. must be satisfied.\"\nSince then nothing further has been contributed. On three\nsubsequent occasions, Nov. 1, 1901, July 1, and July 7,\n1902, in some unintelligible fragments, there appear to be\nreminiscences of the attempts at words in the autumn of\n1901, but these have no meaning, no connexion with the\ncontext or with one another, and no reference to my husband.\nThey appear in fact to be reminiscences of what has been\nearlier written in the script, not fresh contributions in any\nsense. There are other instances in the script of similar\nechoes.\nIn October, 1902, finding that no further development had\noccurred for a year, my husband related the whole experiment\nto me and we then looked through the script and selected the\nrelevant passages. The abruptness with which the search\nfor the three words terminated is perhaps no less remark\nable than the persistence with which during six weeks it\nwas pursued. It is also noticeable that the cessation of the\nattempts followed instantly iipon my becoming aware that\nmy husband was trying an experiment.\nNo one who reads the detailed account of the writing\nof August and September, 1901, can, I think, have any\ndoubt that there is a connexion between the persistent\nefforts of the script and the test that had been devised\nby my husband. There is nothing else at all like this in\nthe history of the automatic writing. Efforts have been made\nby the script on other occasions to convey information, and\nthe information so conveyed has often required piecing together\nand has extended over long periods of time. But in no\nother case have the efforts been consecutive and concentrated,\nhardly wandering from the subject at all, for it is evident,\nI think, on reading what was produced between Aug. 13 and\nSept. 20 that though a great deal is said which does not\nadvance the enquiry, little else but this enquiry forms the\nmatter communicated ; that is to say, the references to places\nand people, etc., seem to be brought in during the efforts made\n\f166 Chapter VIII. [PART\nto trace the various possible clues, not to have an interest\nor an object of their own. In other cases, where repeated\nefforts have been made to convey the same information,\nthe remarks were scattered over a long period of time and\namid much matter bearing on quite disconnected topics.\nHere, on the contrary, after a few tentative references to\nthe subject (on June 3, June 16, and July 3) a definite\napproach is made on July 31 ; interest was aroused in\nme by my husband's evident interest in the writing of\nthat day, though I had no idea what it was that had a\nmeaning for him, and then, after another ten days, on August\n13 the script began to approach the subject of the three\nGreek words and to that subject it stuck for six weeks ;\nthen it abruptly dismissed the subject, with an expression\nintimating the dismissal, and never- recurred to it again.\nAs regards success, it will not I think be denied that the\nscript made an attempt at the problem\u2014a thing itself\nremarkable in the circumstances. Also it came near to what\nwas set both in sound and sense. The script is full, for the\ntime, of the ideas morning and east, named or suggested in\nvarious ways; more than once occurs a translation, or some\nthing very near it, of the original words\u2014\" going towards the\neast,\" \" in the east to the daylight,\" and so on. The language\nand words too are approached, the middle word e? is correctly\nand repeatedly given ; it is indicated clearly that the \u00ab, is pre\nceded by a compound of \/U.OVQ-, and it is suggested that the\nfinal word begins with a and ends with o. When it is considered\nthat all this while I had no notion that any experiment\nwhatever was on foot, and had no reason to suppose so, the\nfacts, I think, are certainly noteworthy.\nI have dealt with this incident at great length because it\nseems to me to possess a special value for those who are\ninterested in the questions raised by the study of my auto\nmatic script ; the problem here is much more definite than\nin most of the other cases. It is possible to place side by\nside the thing aimed at and the thing attained, and judge\nthe results. Again, the general difficulty of estimating the\nvalue of the script is brought out very clearly by this\nincident ; given the words selected by my husband it can, in\nmy view, be shown that the script from Aug. 13 to Sept. 20,\n\fLIII.] Experiments in Telepathy. 167\n1901, bears unmistakeable evidence of a knowledge of their\nappearance and their meaning. But had we not known the\nwords, they would have been irrecoverable from the script,\nalthough a careful examination would have shown an effort to\ncommunicate something definite, and something intelligible to\nmy husband. Under these circumstances it is rash to count\nas rubbish all that is not easily understood. We should\nrather apply in other cases the patience and scrutiny which\nwere in this case justified.\n(2) The second experiment tried without my knowledge\nwas a complete failure. Mr. Gilbert Murray, who stayed\nwith us in November, 1902, and heard of the experiment\nabove described, tried a similar one on his departure, with\nout telling me anything of his intentions. But when he\ntold me of this experiment on Sept. 9, 1903, I found no\ntrace of any allusion to it in the script produced in the\nlast ten months.\nIt should be said that though Mr. Murray has been suc\ncessful in experiments involving telepathy with other persons,\nthere has been no evidence for thought-transference between\nhim and me ; on the other hand, there have been recorded\nsome instances, though not many, of successful telepathy, both\nspontaneous and experimental, between myself and my husband,\nand some further traces of knowledge of what was in his\nmind appear in the script.1\n(B) EXPERIMENTS WITH MY KNOWLEDGE.\nIt does not form part of the scheme of this paper to\ndiscuss the series of experiments in simultaneous automatic\nwriting with other writers 2 unknown, or but slightly known\nto me, which I have from time to time carried out. But\nthough the mass of the writing here dealt with has been\nproduced spontaneously, there are a few cases where experi\nments have been tried which are of the same general type\n1 See p. 184. See also Proc. S.P.R., Vol. VIIL, pp. 481-2.\n2 A paper on experiments in simultaneous writing by Mrs.\nBradgate and myself was read at a meeting of the S.P.R. and\nreported in the Journal for November, 1904.\n\f168 Chapter VIII. [PART\nas the other matter here discussed and are therefore included.\nOn three or four occasions I have arranged to sit for writing\nat the same hour as Mrs. Forbes, and the results are described\nin that part of this paper which deals with the relations\nbetween our automatic writings. The other experiments are\nas follows :\n(1) Six attempts to read the contents of a sealed envelope\nsent to me by Mr. F. C. Constable, then unknown to me ;\n(2) Three similar attempts two years later;\n(3) Two scripts produced when sitting at the same time\nas a friend, Mrs. Dew Smith ;\n(4) Attempts to obtain some Greek words known only to\nthe friend who suggested the experiment.\n(1) First experiment with Mr. Constable, November, 1902.\nOn Nov. 4, 1902, I received from Miss Johnson a letter\nand a sealed envelope sent to her by Mr. F. C. Constable of\nWick Court near Bristol, with a request that I would try\nan experiment, and see whether by sitting with the sealed\nenvelope in my hand I could obtain in the script any\nreference to its contents. Mr. Constable, who is a member\nof the S.P.R., and had heard a paper read at a meeting\nby me about my script, was an absolute stranger to me.\nI sat with the sealed envelope in my left hand on Nov. 4,\n5, 7, 11, 18, and 24; after this I returned the envelope\nunopened to Miss Johnson and was made acquainted with its\ncontents and other circumstances by Mr. Constable whom I\nmet in town on Dec. 9. The conditions were excellent :\nMr. Constable and I were strangers ; I had no means of\nanticipating what was likely to interest him ; I received from\nhim one letter only, written on Nov. 7, until after the\nconclusion of the experiment. The question is whether any\nconnexion is established between the problem set by him and\nthe results shown in my writing.\nBriefly the facts are these : The sealed envelope contained\na letter from Mr. Constable addressed to Mr. Gurney ;\nMr. Gurney had known of a \" psychic \" experience of Mr.\nConstable's following upon his mother's death on Aug. 7,\n1867, in which the word \"fuchsia\" was the important point.\n\fLiu.] Experiments in Telepathy. 169\nMr. Constable's idea was to send in closed envelopes to me\nand to Mrs. Piper letters addressed to Mr. Gurney suggesting\nthat some knowledge of the \" fuchsia \" incident should appear\nin our automatic writings. None of these facts were known\nto me at the time of the experiment. I learnt them from\nMr. Constable when I met him for the first time on Dec.\n9, 1902.\nThe whole of the script produced on the six sittings is\ngiven in the Appendix.1 On Nov. 4, 5, 11, and 18, I held the\nenvelope the whole time that the writing was being produced ;\non Nov. 7 I put it down after nine words had been written,\nand the last part of the script, which obviously refers to\nother matters, is excluded from this experiment. On Nov. 24\nI fell asleep in the course of the writing and have no note\non the subject of how long I held the envelope. I regarded\nthe first words, \" I can't do more,\" as expressing a desire to\ndiscontinue the experiment, and thereupon returned the un\nopened envelope to Miss Johnson.\nIt is not easy to summarise the results : in the first three\ntrials there seems to recur an effort after something represented\nby \" Constantia \" and \" dementia \" on Nov. 4, \" Olivia \" and\n\"a long woman's name ending ia\" on Nov. 5, and \"Constantia\"\nagain on Nov. 7 ; this may possibly be aimed at the word\n\" fuchsia \"\u2014a word, it may be noted, made by adding \" ia \"\nto the name \" Fuchs \"\u2014which is what Mr. Constable hoped\nto have produced, and if so the script of Nov. 7 was justified\nin saying \" one only word.\" But the general description of the\nletter on Nov. 5 is too indefinite to be of value, and a state\nment about the \" short name like Jack \" is incorrect. The script\nof Nov. 11 gives no information; the only point on Nov. 18\nthat bears on the matter is the introduction of the name Gurney.\nThe name is not however connected by the script with the\nletter, and the quotation introduced has no applicability. The\nlast piece of writing is very confused ; the only point of contact\nwith the experiment seems to be in the introduction of\nDr. Hodgson's name and the statement that \" he had tried\nthe flowers but without success.\" The same experiment had\nbeen suggested by Mr. Constable to Dr. Hodgson to try\nwith Mrs. Piper, so in that case too the word wanted was\nApp., p. 394.\n\f170 Chapter VIII. [PART\nthe name of a flower. But the sentence in my script may\nrefer to an experiment that Dr. Hodgson had suggested my\ntrying in the spring of 1902, to which, however, no reference\nhad been made in the script since the allusion on April\n24, 1902, described above.1 It is perhaps more than a\ncoincidence that an allusion should be made to \" Hodgson \"\nand an experiment with flowers while I was trying to get\nat what Mr. Constable wanted. But it is not distinctive\nenough to be of evidential value.\nBut if we turn from the question of the contents of the\nsealed envelope to the general intention of Mr. Constable,\nI think there is a suggestion of connexion between his\nthoughts and my script. On Nov. 3, the day on which\nhe wrote the letter which he sealed and the two letters\nexplaining the experiment to Miss Johnson and to me, my\nscript produced the following : 2\nNone the less through others not known speaks the fate,\u2014\nfatum ineffabile ineluctabile, etsi tu magno contendis corpore\ncontra.\nI will give the words between you neither alone can read, but\ntogether they will give the clue he wants.\nComperire . . . redintegratio amoris A nee non secessus (desunt\nhi alia et alioquin) Redit iam verbum ipsum\u2014Caritatis voca-\nbulura, but hers are in English and will fill the gaps\u2014Wait\nsome time for hers\u2014it is hard to give her words.\nTuus\u2014iam nomen habes in mente etsi non in calamo. *\nThis was absolutely unintelligible to me at the time, and\nI do not profess to understand it now.

The script\nsuggests\n(1) an utterance from a stranger,\n(2) a division of a task between two persons,\n(3) the obtaining of a clue for some one (masculine),\n(4) an effort of some one other than myself (feminine) to\ngive words.\nThe above four points are not out of keeping with the\nconditions of the experiment, and the receipt of Mr. Con\nstable's letter and enclosure on Nov. 4 suggested to me at the\ntime a possible meaning for the otherwise unintelligible words\nabout \" the clue he wants.\"\nThe script of Nov. 7 also suggests a telepathic connexion\nwith Mr. Constable ; after returning to \" Constantia \" it adds\n\" one only word,\" and refuses absolutely to say more. In a\nletter written on Nov. 7 and received on Nov. 8, thanking me\nfor undertaking the experiment, Mr. Constable, who had been\nvery careful in the letter proposing the experiment to give\nme no clue as to what he had put in the sealed envelope,\nwrote : \" I thank you heartily for trying my experiment\u2014\nperhaps one word meaningless to you.\" This, I think, shows\nthat on Nov. 7 his thoughts were occupied with the word\n' fuchsia ' which he hoped to obtain, rather than with the\ngeneral contents of the sealed letter, and on the same day\nmy script distinctly committed itself to the statement about\n\" one only word.\" 1\n(2) Second experiment with Mr. Constable, November, 1904.\nOn Nov. 10, 1904, I heard from Mr. Constable, enclosing\na sealed envelope for experiment. In answer I told him that\nI would try as before, but that I would take three or four\nweeks over the experiment, as I was not at that time writing\nautomatically often. I sat with the envelope in my hand\nthree times, on Nov. 18, 23, and 25. Contrary to the usual\nhabit, after the first attempt at automatic writing I had a\nstrong impression about the experiment which I recorded in\nmy diary on Nov. 19. On Nov. 25, immediately after writing,\n!For subsequent possible connexion between Mr. Constable and\nmy script, of a spontaneous kind, see p. 181.\n\f172 Chapter VIII. [BART\nI had another distinct feeling that I \" was to write my\nimpressions to him at once.\" This I did, so that on this\noccasion the results on my side are represented not only by\nthree pieces of automatic writing, but by my letter of Nov. 25\nto Mr. Constable.\nThe details appear in the Appendix ; 1 I summarise the\nincident here :\nMr. Constable had heard at the Council dinner of the S.P.R.\non Oct. 21 that there was a likelihood of opening a sealed\nletter left by Mr. Myers, in consequence of statements made\nby my script. He felt doubt as to the value of such a test,\nregarded as evidence for the continuing of personal identity after\ndeath, thinking that the contents of the letter might become\nknown to a medium by clairvoyance. He therefore tried to devise\na test to distinguish if possible between the effect on a medium\nof (a) the actual words written in the letter itself\u2014to be read\nby clairvoyance\u2014and (b) the thoughts impressed on the letter,\nor elsewhere, by the writer\u2014to be learnt by telepathy in the\nwidest sense, by connexion, that is, between the minds of the\nmedium and the agent. Accordingly, on Nov. 9 he wrote two\nletters, which he placed in envelopes and sealed ; one of these\ncontained the word \" fuchsia,\" and this he sent to me ; the\nother contained a record of the writer's thoughts (as dis\ntinguished from the actual word), namely that, from 8.30 to\n9.30, he was thinking of his mother. This letter was retained\nin the custody of Mrs. Constable.\nThe impressions, recorded in my diary, and sent to Mr.\nConstable after the three attempts had been made, were as\nfollows :\n(1) that the contents of the letter were less important\nthan the circumstances of the experiment ;\n(2) that the experiment was suggested to Mr. Constable by\nsome one else ;\n(3) that the experiment was connected with the sealed\nenvelope (i.e. the Myers envelope which there was a\nquestion of opening), and meant as a preliminary trial ;\n(4) that the sealed envelope sent me was one of two and\nthe less important.\n!See App., p. 395.\n\fLIU.] Experiments in Telepathy. 173\nI further noted that the script had made curly drawings\nand an attempt at a word.\nThe above four impressions may on the whole be said to\nbe correct ; the experiment, though not suggested to Mr.\nConstable by some one else, was devised by him as the\nresult of conversation with other persons ; the sealed envelope\nsent to me was one of two, the shorter and the less important,\ninasmuch as it represented the written word (a), and not the\nwriter's thought (b). These impressions are definitely enough\nrecorded in the script, which distinctly states,1 on Nov. 23,\nafter attempts at a word, that there is a second envelope held\nby another person, and that one of the envelopes contains a\nsingle word, and, on Nov. 23 and 25, that the experiment is\ndevised as a preliminary trial before opening the Myers\nenvelope.\nThe experiment then seems to have failed so far as concerns\nthe actual words contained in both letters, the letter I held\nand the second, of the existence of which I did not know ;\nbut the script indicates knowledge of the fact that there\nwere two letters, and of the object of the experiment. That\nis to say, there is no evidence of clairvoyance or of direct\ntransference from Mr. Constable's mind of what he intended\nto convey. But it appears that the script showed acquaintance\nwith the circumstances of the experiment and of facts within\nMr. Constable's knowledge beyond what might be expected\nfrom mere guessing.\n(3) Experiment with Mrs. Dew Smith, April, 1903.\nOn April 2, 1903, I saw my friend Mrs. Dew Smith,\nand found that she had been trying experiments in the\nproduction of automatic phenomena by table tilting. We\narranged to have two simultaneous but separate sittings\non April 10 and 13, but I was prevented from sitting\non the 13th. On the 10th the script produced a message\nin English and Greek, referring to Mrs. Dew Smith by\nher Christian name and signed with a monogram.2 The\ncontents are too confused and enigmatic for verification ;\nthe word fiovdSe\\tyos (with one brother) occurs twice, and\nthe signature consisted of two letters of my friend's initials\n!See App., p. 397. 2See App., p. 400.\n\f174 Chapter VIII. [PART\n\" A.D. \" in a monogram. She has never to my knowledge\nused a monogram. I sent the writing to her and heard that\nthough enigmatic the message was suggestive to her ; her\nthoughts had been much occupied lately with her husband's\nonly brother, and the monogram reminded her of one used by\nher husband who had died early in 1903. His first initial\nwas A, as I must have known though I had no recollection\nof it, and he used Albert Durer's signature as a mark on\nsome of his belongings. I must have seen Albert Durer's\nsignature on engravings, but certainly never knew that it was\nused by Mr. Dew Smith ; there is a certain resemblance\nbetween the Durer signature and the signature of my script,\nwhich is the only distinct monogram so occurring in the\nwriting. I knew of no brother of Mr. Dew Smith's, and had\nalways supposed him to be an only son.\nOn April 22 I heard the above facts from Mrs. Dew\nSmith, and she said that she would sit on Mondays and Fri\ndays after tea. On Friday, April 24, my script contained a\nshort message about something quite different and added \" I\ncannot do it to-day.\" On Monday, April 27, the early part\nof the script was supposed by me to refer to Mrs. Dew Smith,\nand therefore was sent to her in London ; the latter half, in\na totally different handwriting, referred to Dr. Hodgson, and\nwhen sent to him proved intelligible.\nThe part sent to Mrs. Dew Smith contained the words\n\" not the ring \" followed by an attempt to describe and imitate\na handwriting. Then after writing \" ask about the round\nmirror where that is,\" it proceeded to draw and describe an\ninstrument like a pair of tweezers.\nThe writing was in a small sloping hand quite unlike my\nown, and not recalling anything whatever to me.\nMrs. Dew Smith wrote on May 1 from Haslemere that\non Friday, April 24, she had sent a message mentally to me,\nwhen sitting as we had arranged, asking for answers to two\nquestions :\n(a) where was an ivory footrule belonging to her husband\nwhich she had lost ;\n(&) what she should give to a friend of his as a memento.\n(a) Near the spot where she last used the footrule (in\nher London house, not in the country where she was staying\n\fLIU.] Experiments in Telepathy. 175\nwhen she wrote) was a small round mirror lying on a table\nas it had not yet been hung up.1\n(b) She had thought of giving to the friend a ring which her\nhusband used to wear, but hesitated as she did not herself\nwish to part with it : the writing described and imitated in\nmy script reminded her of that of the friend in question.\nA letter from the friend was enclosed.\nIt will be seen that in a sense the script of April 27\nanswered the two questions put to me mentally by Mrs. Dew\nSmith on April 24 ; (a) \" ask about the round mirror where\nthat is \" had an applicability to the disappearance of the\nfootrule which had last been used in proximity to a round\nmirror ; (b) the words \" not the ring \" were a direct answer\nto the second question. The likeness between the writing of\nthe script and that of Mrs. Dew Smith's friend is not\nmarked, though there appears to be some ; the final d is like ;\nso is the r ; so is the general appearance of the document ;\nbut a stroke before the initial vowel, emphasised in the\nscript, does not occur in the letter. The other article\ndescribed has not been identified.\nOn the whole then, there seems some reason to think that\nfacts known to Mrs. Dew Smith were represented in the\nscript. I had no knowledge of a round mirror as a possession\nof hers, though, as I had been in her London house, I may\nhave seen it. I had no reason to suppose that she was\nthinking about a ring. The writer of the letter was and is\nwholly unknown to me and I had certainly never seen any\nspecimen of the handwriting.\nThere have been no further attempts to obtain simul\ntaneous phenomena between Mrs. Dew Smith and myself ;\nwe had, many years ago, some success in experimental\ntelepathy, and a few cases of apparently veridical reference\nto her in the script are related below.2\n(4) Experiment with Mr. W. C. Marshall, May, 1904.\nThis last experiment was a failure. On May 13, 1904,\nit was suggested that I should try to get in my script certain\n1 She had recently moved into the London house.\n2 See p. 183.\n\f176 Chapter VIII.

The script at\nonce wrote that the words were five and should be got the\nnext day. The next day, May 14, it produced five Greek\nwords incorrectly written and hardly construable, and on\nJune 5, 1904, without any context or reference to Mr.\nMarshall, the script wrote: \" Two foreign words maranthinon\ntelesphoron. Two long words not in English.\"\nNo further attempts were made for some months. I then\nlearned from Mr. Marshall that the words wanted were two\nin number, but that the attempts in the script did not\nresemble them.\nAn attempted correction on Dec. 30, after I had heard\nas above from Mr. Marshall, took us no further, and the\nscript has made no other reference to the subject.1\n^ee App., p. 401, for the script referring to this subject.\n\fLIIL] References to Living Acquaintances. 177\nCHAPTER IX.\nSPONTANEOUS REFERENCES IN THE SCRIPT TO LIVING\nACQUAINTANCES.\nAs has been said above, the greater part of the script is\nconcerned with remarks about identifiable persons, living or\ndead. Often the remarks are perfectly vague : \" Ask So-and-\nso,\" \" Such-and-such would know.\" Sometimes they are of\nno evidential value, as they deal with matters well within\nmy own knowledge at the time. But in other cases information\nis thus conveyed which was not in my possession. I have\nmade a complete collection of all these \" messages,\" as the pro\nportion of grain to chaff is an important element in forming\nconclusions as to the value of the script, but I do not propose\nto describe them in detail.\nBefore discussing them here some words should be said on\nthe selection of the persons written about in the script.\nNames of living persons occur some 280 times; in more\nthan 60 cases the references are to other persons known\nby me as themselves obtaining or able to obtain automatic\nphenomena.1 The remaining 214 occasions may be classified as\nfollows :\n(I.) Miscellaneous, - - - - - - 28\n(II.) Personal friends known to be specially interested\nin the script, - - - - - 186\nviz. (A) Persons already connected with\nthe script 6\n(B) A. W.

Under the circumstances, and considering my own\nstrong interest in the work of the S.P.R., it is not surprising\nthat the greater number of names occurring in the script should\nbe those of persons intimately associated with that work ;\nnor is it surprising to find a considerable number of references\nto my husband and my daughter,\u2014both of them interested in\nthe production of these automatic phenomena. But I should\nnot have expected to find so complete an omission of other\nfriends of mine, living or dead, very intimately associated\nwith me and constantly represented in other uncontrolled\nconditions of my mind, for instance in dreams. Thus,\nthere is no reference whatever to my mother, who died\nsome twelve years ago, nor to my sister, and only one very\ndoubtful allusion to my father, both living. These three\nrelatives figure fairly often in my dreams, and I have had\nsome experiences suggestive of a telepathic connexion between\nmy sister and myself.1 Here again, as in the case of the\nselection of languages,2 it is clear that the selecting agency\nis not my normal self, nor even what a deliberate dramatisation\non my own part would suggest.\nI take the cases in detail,3 beginning with the small group\nof \" miscellaneous \" persons whose names appear in the script.\n(I.) MISCELLANEOUS NAMES. 28.\nThe miscellaneous names may be classified under five\nheads.\n!See S.P.R. Journal, IX., p. 134. 2See p. 32.\n3 I here discuss only cases where the actual name is found in the\nscript; there are some cases where subsequent information suggested\nthat allusions to particular persons were intended, but those are not\nincluded in this classification.\n\fLIII.] References to Living Acquaintances. 179\n(1) Unintelligible Introductory Phrases. 2.\nTwice where names occur at the beginning of a communi\ncation they seem to be mere rubbish, used while getting under\nway.\n(2) Preliminary attempts at things later completely expressed. 5.\nThere are five possible instances of this. It seems occasion\nally as if in the effort to produce a particular word some\nother word, quite incorrect but associated in idea, were first\nproduced, shaken out as it were from a bag of counters by\nmistake. Thus I have little doubt that in the writing of\nDec. 10, 1901, \"Mrs. Pattrick. Note the name\u2014Hill Side\nthat's why I know,\" \" Mrs. Pattrick \" represents the first\nemergence of the idea subsequently produced in \" Hill Side.\"\nMrs. Pattrick is the name of a lady, an acquaintance of mine,\nwho lives in Hill Side, the house in Cambridge where Dr.\nand Mrs. Sidgwick lived before they came to Newnham College.\nAgain on July 19, 1903, the name Horatio Brwwn (sic)\nwas followed by mere scribbles ; the name is naturally associated\nwith Venice, and the next writings, on July 21 and July 31,\n1903, conveyed messages about Venice of possible evidential\nvalue. I am inclined to think that the name Horatio Brown\nemerged in approaching the idea of Venice.\n(3) My own initials. 1.\nThese occurred once on April 19, 1901, in a passage written\nwith some urgency during a journey ; they may represent a\npersonal remonstrance or appeal. The script wrote : \" Cant\nyou see ? cant you believe ? M. de G. V.\"\n(4) Ambitious. 3.\nThree times the name \" Arthur \" occurs in a hand quite\nunlike my own, and quite unlike the rest of the writing in\nthe context. It is possible that the intention is to refer to\nmy husband, but as he is usually ! referred to by his initials,\nA.W.V., or by description, as \" your husband,\" I have not\ncounted these as allusions to him.\n1 There is one exception; on Oct. 6, after a reference to the\nChristian name of a brother, his own name Arthur is used.\n\f180 Chapter IX. [PART\n(5) Attempts to produce evidential matter. 17.\nThe remaining 17 instances (14 names, 3 being double) are\napparently attempts to produce verifiable matter, but some are\ncomplete failures, some too vague to be tested, some not beyond\nthe range of my own guessing, and only five or six perhaps\ncorrect.\nTwo of the latter refer to the same friend, Miss Jane\nHarrison, and are the only references to her in the whole of\nthe script. On Jan. 29, 1902, the script wrote:\nThe little book was lost and is found with the pages faintly\nnumbered in ink at the top. written in on the right hand pages\u2014\nand a few words opposite. It opens badly\u2014some is in pencil, it\nis hard to read. There was a monogram two letters intertwined 1\nlike that. Perhaps Miss Harrison knows. It is not clear\nyet.\nI learnt on enquiry from Miss Harrison that she had mis\nlaid a small book containing notes about the subject of a lecture\nwhich she was to give on Jan. 31. She had been looking for\nthe book \" all the week,\" that is, between Jan. 24 and\nJan. 30, when I spoke to her. The book was an interleaved\ntext, so that, on opening it, there would appear on one side\nthe Greek text, on the other Miss Harrison's own notes in\nink and in pencil, undoubtedly \" hard to read.\" But the\ntext was alternately on the right and on the left hand\npage, and there was no monogram on the cover. The book\nwas found in time for the lecture, but its disappearance had\ncaused a good deal of annoyance to its owner during the four\nor five days preceding my script.\nThe second reference to Miss Harrison was on Feb. 6,\n1904, when she was with us in Algeria. It merely stated,\nin a writing not mine, that the date ought to help Miss\nHarrison to identify the supposed communicator :\nIt is for Jane show it to her, she will know what it means &\nthe date ought to help her February 6th long ago now,\nFeb. 6 was in fact the birthday of a young sister of Miss\nHarrison's who had died nearly thirty years before, and whom\n1E.C. appear to be the letters, the E being reversed.\n\fLiu.] References to Living Acquaintances. 181\nI had never known. But neither the writing nor the attempt\nat a signature recalled anything to Miss Harrison.\n(II.) PERSONS KNOWN TO BE INTERESTED IN THE SCRIPT. 186.\nWe now come to references in the script to persons whose\nknown interest in the script or in its usual topics would make\nthe occurrence of their names likely.\n(A) Persons already mentioned in script. 6.\nI begin with some cases where the person referred to had\nalready been connected with the script before the actual\noccurrence in the script of the name.\nMr. Marsh. 1.\nOn Sept. 19, 1903, Mr. Marsh, the subject of an apparently\nsuccessful prediction 1 in which, however, his name had not\nbeen mentioned, was expected to stay with us. On Sept. 17\nthe scribe wrote : \" Mr. Marsh has something to tell you\nthis week,\" but the statement proved incorrect.\nMr. F. 0. Constable. 1.\nThe experiments with Mr. Constable have been described\nabove.2 After the conclusion of the first, Mr. Constable and\nI met, for the first time, in London on Dec. 9, 1902, and\nsome automatic writing produced by me in his presence,\ncontained a drawing of a chain and a reference to a cornelian\nheart, which induced me to refer to Mr. Constable the remarks\nwhich were made by the script, a few days later, on Dec. 14.\nThe links should help\u2014a little golden chain\u2014and a heart sus\npended\u2014P atris eius in memoriam a little old fashioned por\ntrait, three curls on either side the face\u2014no cap\u2014in a gilt frame,\na miniature oval shaped\u2014the neck is bare\u2014the dress gray the\nheart belongs to her but is not in the portrait\u2014it was given after.\nThe experiment, as will be remembered, had concerned an\nincident connected with Mr. Constable's mother and in the\ncourse of our conversation he had mentioned that he had a\n!See below, p. 331. \"See pp. 168-173.\n\f182 Chapter IX. [PART\nportrait of his mother hanging up in his room. In answer to\nmy enquiries, Mr. Constable told me, in three letters written\non Jan. 1, 3 and 7, 1903, that there hangs in his study\na photograph of his mother which is an enlarged copy taken\nfrom a small oval daguerreotype in a gilt frame. The hair\nis shown in three curls1 on each side, and there is no cap.\nThe lady is wearing a brown velvet cloak and the neck is\nsomewhat conspicuously bare. She had and habitually wore\na long gold chain made of links, and on this chain a locket\u2014\nbut not a heart, cornelian or otherwise ; the locket was given\nto her in 1863, some years later than the date of the daguerreo\ntype portrait, which was probably taken in 1856 or 1857 for\na son who was going to India. The daguerreotype is now in\nthe possession of that son's daughter. It further appeared (1)\nthat till quite recently Mr. Constable had been under the\nimpression that the original from which his photograph had\nbeen enlarged was not a daguerreotype but a miniature, and\n(2) that to wear the neck bare was characteristic of the\nlady.\nIt would thus seem as if there were some information\nconveyed by the script definite enough to be evidential,\nthough not all the statements are correct. \" The dress is\ngray \" is not correct ; no dress is visible in the picture, and\nit has not been found possible to ascertain the colour of the\ndress which was worn at the time ; the cloak is known to have\nbeen brown, though naturally the photograph does not show\nany colour. It is, however, possible to interpret the words\n' the dress gray ' as suggesting that the general appearance of\nthe costume is gray (as in the photograph), not coloured (as in\na painting). \" A heart \" again is not a correct description\nof the locket; a locket however, was (1) worn on a gold\nchain, (2) is not shown in the picture, and (3) was given\nto the lady after the picture had been taken. The details\nof the description of the portrait are correct and the script\nseems to have hit upon a characteristic touch in the \" bare\nneck.\"\n1 The lady wore more than three curls on each side, but only three\nare shown in the portrait, so that in this respect the script appears to\nreproduce the actual picture rather than a general impression of the\nlady herself.\n\fLin.] References to Living Acquaintances. 183\nMrs. Dew Smith. 4.\nBesides the references to Mrs. Dew Smith aboved described 1\nwhen I was definitely thinking of her before obtaining auto\nmatic scripts, there have been four others, on June 21, 1903,\nAug. 31, 1903, Dec. 7, 1903, and Dec. 23, 1904. The\nthird, Dec. 7, 1903, is a mere allusion to a visit that\nshe was to pay me and lays no claim to evidential or\nother value ; the other three purport to convey information\nunknown to me. They are as follows :\n(a) June 21, 1903 (Switzerland).\nWhat is Alice doing ? she has found a house now\u2014ask. a little\nhouse near a wood, with a sunny garden on one side.\nI had not seen Mrs. Dew Smith since April and knew nothing\nof her intentions : at the end of July, on returning from\nSwitzerland, I heard from her that she had been wanting to\nfind a small house in the New Forest with a garden, but\nhad no particular house in view.\n(6) Aug. 31, 1903.\nTell Alice from me the pen [or pin] will be found and can\nthen be given back\u2014But she is too anxious.\nI was uncertain whether the word was pen or pin, and\nasked Mrs. Dew Smith, when I saw her on Sept. 1, whether\nshe had lost either a pen or a pin. She said that she had\nnot. But the next day she remembered and told me that\non Aug. 31 she missed a little parcel of pens which she\nvalued and about which she had written to make enquiries.\nThe pens were eventually found, but not till some months later.\n(c) Dec. 23, 1904.\nNow give this message to Alice Dew. Her plan is a good\none & she should carry it out at once : I know there is some dis\napproval but that will pass. She is quite right in her view. Tell\nher that. tell her with emphasis. She is to do it & not be\ndeterred by their criticism.\nShe sat alone last night late but I could not make her hear. She\nwill remember the little tinkling bell. That will prove my truth.\n^ee above, p. 173.\n\f184 Chapter IX. [PART\nIn a letter of December 27, Mrs. Dew Smith told me in\nanswer to enquiries that for the last six months her mind\nhad been full of a plan for building a cottage to live in\nat the end of the next year ; that there were difficulties in\nthe way, and that all her friends opposed her plans and\ncriticised the scheme. She had no site in view, but the\nplans for the cottage were actually made and the main point\nof adverse criticism was a very large room which she wished\nto build.\nShe wrote from the country where she was staying with\na sister, and said that not being alone she had only once\nsince leaving town made automatic experiments. She had\nunusual difficulty and obtained nothing. That was on Dec. 22\nor 23. She also said that she had a strong impression of\nhearing a little bell outside the house one evening and wondered\nif it were a bicycle bell, but was not sure that it was on the\nevening mentioned.\nNo one of these cases taken alone is of much evidential\nvalue, but the three taken together perhaps show some reflexion\nin the script of thoughts and actions telepathically or otherwise\nnot normally conveyed. The last in particular presents a\nmessage which, though unfortunately vague, is distinctly ap\npropriate, and the attempts to give corroborative evidence are\ngood as far as they go,\u2014better certainly than I thought\nlikely at the time, for, believing Mrs. Dew Smith to be at\nher own house in town, I thought it very improbable that\nany tinkling bell would have been noticed.\n(B) A. W. Verrall. 34.\nAllusions by name, initials or description were made to\nmy husband on thirty-two occasions (twice referring to two\nseparate incidents) counted as thirty-four times. Many of these\nallusions are clearly intended to be evidential, but some contain\nonly references to what has been said earlier in the script\nor must otherwise be supposed known to me ; others again\nare too vague to contribute anything verifiable. Those that\npurport to be evidential may be classed under three heads,\nwhich I here call Successes, Failures, and False Statements.\nUnder \" Successes \" I have counted cases where some correct\ninformation seems to -have been conveyed, even where there\n\fLIU.] References to Living Acquaintances. 185\nare also mistakes. \" False statement \" is used when the\nstatement is ascertainably wrong ; \" Failure,\" when for one\nreason or another no test has been possible. The classification\nhas been made mainly with a view to clearness of treatment\nand not for statistical purposes. It is as follows : 1\n(a) Non-evidential - - - - - - 13\n(5) Would-be evidential 21\nviz. Successes - - - 10\nFalse statements - - 3\nFailures 8\nTotal .... 34\nFalse Statements.\nThree attempts to give something \" wanted \" or \" thought\nof \" by my husband are certainly wrong. The only experiment\nmade by him in connexion with the script has been above\ndescribed ; it required no \" woman's name,\" as suggested by\nthe script on Nov. 4, 1901. I learnt early in October, 1902,\nof that experiment, and that knowledge of mine is probably\nresponsible for the incorrect suggestion (Oct. 27 and 31,\n1902), that he had thought of something else for me to\nproduce.\nFailures.\nOn July 8, 1901, the script produced what I took to\nbe a message to my husband from an unnamed person who\nhad known him at Trinity College. The vague reminiscences\nrecalled nothing to him. On Nov. 25, 1901, the College\nfriend of July 8 was certainly associated and perhaps identified\nwith Mr. F. M. Balfour. But my husband has not been able\nto recall any special conversation such as is described, though\nnaturally, after 25 years, his memory is not very clear.2\n1 A complete list is given in App., pp. 401-3. To enable the reader\nto form some idea of the nature and value of references in the script\nto specified persons I have dealt in detail with these references to\nmy husband, which are typical of the rest. In regard to other\npersons so mentioned, I confine myself to classification and descrip\ntion of selected instances.\n2 See also p. 277.\n\f186 Chapter IX. [PART\nTwo statements (Nov. 1, 1901, and Aug. 21, 1904) are\nwholly unintelligible; another (Oct. 12, 1901) seems to be\npartly a reminiscence of the attempts to guess \/j.ovoTrw\\ov\ne? aw, and partly a confused attempt to say something about\nDr. Benson, the late Archbishop of Canterbury, who was\nHead Master of Wellington College, when my husband was\nat school there.\nIn October, 1902, the script described on two occasions\nsome purple garment laid aside in a chest with a lock of\ngray hair and a toy or child's letter. In each case the\nincident is connected by the script with my husband; on\nOct. 9 ! he is definitely stated to have seen it worn, and\non Oct. 31 the subject recurs immediately after a reference\nto him. But in the absence of clear indication to whom to\napply, we have not been able to test this assertion.\nAn expression familiar to my husband 2 was given on Jan.\n30, 1903, but in the impossibility of proving that it was\nunknown to me, the incident is not evidential.\nSuccesses.\nSix of the ten cases where my husband's name occurs in\nattempts, at least partially successful, to produce verifiable\nunknown facts, deal with his thought-transference experiment,\nand have been discussed above.3\nOf the others, two apparently show telepathic knowledge\nof things in his mind, unknown to me ; one perhaps shows a\nconfused impression of his future action, not at the time\nwithin his knowledge ; the last is difficult to classify, and\nmay be a merely accidental coincidence.\nI discuss these four in chronological sequence.\nScript of April 14, 1902. This script was produced under\nthe following circumstances :\nFrom April 9 to 12, 1902, my husband and I stayed together\nat Wellington College, and I twice visited the chapel there\nto see the new aisle 4 which had been built in memory of Arch-\n1 The next paragraph of the script on Oct. 9, which seems to\nshow telepathic knowledge of my husband's thought, though there\nis no explicit reference to him, is described below on p. 189.\n2 See above, p. 138. 3See p. 156.\n4 The original chapel, known well to my husband but not to me,\n\fLin.] References to Living Acquaintances. 187\nbishop Benson. On the first occasion, April 10, I had gone with\nthe Head Master and some other visitors, and I then particularly\nnoticed the Credence table,1 for which my husband had written\nan inscription. On the second occasion, April 11, my husband\nand I were alone for some little time in the chapel, and after\nnoticing the general effect of the new aisle, looked in detail\nat its glass. I read to him the inscriptions on the windows,\nand we also looked at the commemorative tablets in the\ncorridor leading to the chapel. I have no recollection of looking\nspecially at the east end of the chapel.\nOn April 12 my husband and I separated, and on April 14\nI went to visit a friend. While on my way, in the train, I\nfelt discomfort in my right hand, and, taking off my glove to\nrelieve it, suddenly experienced a desire to write automatically.\nThe script so produced began with two statements, afterwards\nverified,2 and then, after an unintelligible remark and a long\nline , came the following :\nThe chapel is too light\u2014something has been taken away was it\na cross in the east ask if he noticed\u2014I tried to show it you don't\nunderstand\u2014let me write Cant uar is sedile ubi nunc gentium?\nnon tuum respondere. defer alii. The angular writing, crabbed,\ncomes again, but you will not like this turn the last letter so no\u2014\nnot that way m s t Verrall Verrall Verrall. V. VERRALL.\nThe writing throughout was in a more angular hand than\nmine. The difference becomes more marked at the end.\nThe first words of the script suggested to me the chapel\nat Wellington College, and the words ' Cant uar is sedile,'\nan allusion to the Archbishop, seemed to confirm this view.\nI could make nothing of the next three words s ' ubi nunc\ngentium,' but the following words, ' It is not for you to\nanswer, ask some one else,' suggested that I should ask my\nhusband. I had not seen him since April 12th; he returned\nhad no aisles. In 1882, before I ever saw the chapel, a north aisle\nhad been added, but the south aisle was not added till 1902.\n!The table had belonged to Dr. Benson, and had been given to\nWellington College Chapel after his death by Mrs. Benson.\n2 See p. 305 for one of these.\n3 Ubi gentium means \" Where in the world ? \" but ubi nunc gentium\ncan only be rendered \"Where is now 'of the nations' (gentium).\"\n\f188 Chapter IX. [PART\nhome on the afternoon of April 18th, after I had copied the\nscript, and I showed it to him at once.\nThe opening words, \" the chapel is too light,\" carried back\nhis thoughts at once to the early days of the original\naisleless chapel, and recalled his own view that the effect\nof the original design had been injured by the addition of\nthe north aisle, which destroyed the proportions and, by its\nnew window at the west end, increased the light within the\nbuilding. The later words reminded him of an incident\nassociated with the eastern end of the chapel. This is\ndecorated below the lancet windows with heads in mosaic,\nsurrounded by inscriptions, and on one occasion, while he was\nat school, he was present in the apse when Dr. Benson,\nthen Head Master, was showing these decorations to a visitor.\nThe visitor, looking at the crabbed characters round the head\nof S. Paul, read the inscription out as ' Ductor Dubitantium,'\n' Leader of the Doubting,' a mistake instantly corrected by the\nHead Master to ' Doctor Gentium,' ' Teacher of the Nations.'\nMy husband has no recollection of having noticed the\nmosaics on the occasion of this last visit on April llth,\n1902, and was certainly not aware of having missed anything\nin the apse, nor has he any recollection of having thought\nof this incident either in the chapel, or on any other occasion,\ntill he read the script, since its occurrence some thirty-five years\nago. At the same time it seems to be very likely that the\ndifficulty which I had in deciphering the words in the windows\nwhen we were together in the chapel on April llth revived\nvaguely in his memory the earlier incident, when, owing to\na difficulty of deciphering, the two words doctor gentium were\nmisread.\nI had no recollection of inscriptions in the mosaics ; when\nmy husband first spoke of an inscription I supposed him to\nrefer to lettering in the windows of the east end. It is,\nhowever, certain that I have at some time seen the mosaic\ninscriptions, as I have several times been into the chapel.\nThe head of S. Paul is on the right hand side, not far from\nthe Credence table, to which my attention had been specially\ndrawn on the preceding day, April 10th.\nI have since ascertained, indirectly in 1903 and by per\nsonal observation and inquiry in July, 1905, that no alteration\n\fLIII.] References to Living Acquaintances. 189\nhas been made at the east end of Wellington College Chapel.\nNothing has been removed, and the inscription doctor gentium\nin \" angular and crabbed \" letters, not easy to read, still\nsurrounds the head of S. Paul. It thus appears that there\nis no truth in the suggestion\u2014tentative, it is true, and\nfollowed by the phrase which commonly shows recognition of\nan error, \" you do not understand \"\u2014that something had\nbeen removed.\nThe reader who sees in this allusion in the script an\nemergence of a submerged memory of my husband's may find a\nparallel in the \" herb moly \" of the preceding autumn, which\nwas connected by the script, as it had once been in my\nhusband's mind, with the \" solitary dawn,\" though at the time\nof his attempt to get a reference to the solitary dawn in my\nwriting he had no associations of it with the herb moly.1\nScript of Oct. 9, 1902.\nOn Oct. 9, 1902, I spent the day in town, leaving home\nat 9.50 a.m. and returning at 9.10 p.m. In the train on\nmy way back, just before 8.55 p.m. I wrote automatically,\nafter a reference to my husband.\nto the dark tower came who ? ask him who 1 and where ? The\ntower was dark & cold, but we all loved it. he will remember\nwrite regularly\u2014there is truth in this.\nThe answer to the first question \" Who ? \" is clearly\n\"Childe Roland.\" The line \" Childe Roland to the dark\ntower came \" is the opening of Edgar's song in King Lear\n(Act III. Sc. 4) and the subject and title of a poem by\nBrowning. There is no context in the Shakespearean\npassage, but Browning's poem describes the surroundings of\nthe tower, so that if the suggestion in the second question\n\" where ? \" was to be pressed it seemed to me that Browning's\npoem2 and not Shakespeare's song was indicated. But I\n^ee above, p. 163.\n2 I can see no special meaning in the words \" The tower was\ndark and cold but we all loved it.\" There is no hint of cold in\nBrowning's poem, though much talk of darkness ; and the \" we \"\nwho \"all loved it\" may be an allusion to the predecessors of\nBrowning's hero, who perished by the way in their attempt to\nreach the tower.\n\f190 Chapter IX. [PART\ncould find no reason for a reference to this poem in anything\nI had done or thought about.\nThe \" him \" whom I was to ask seemed to point to my\nhusband, whose name had occurred just before. Accordingly,\nthe next morning I showed the script to him, and he at\nonce said that during my absence on the day before he\nhad been reading Browning and had especially read, more\nthan once, \" Childe Roland.\" I had no reason whatever to\nexpect him to be reading Browning in general, or that par\nticular poem. The allusion to it in my script seems therefore\nremarkable.\nScript of Aug. 31, 1903.\nThe statements of the script of Aug. 31 1 may be thus\ndivided :\n(1) Hugh will not go abroad next month he rests.\n(2) then comes a hurried journey to the south and the long\nbreak.\n(3) Do not tell this to Arthur.\n(4) It may not be quite right perhaps you do not understand\nbut there is sense & truth in it.\n(5) You will know before Christmas.\nIn these statements it is possible to see a confused expres\nsion of knowledge concerning the future certainly not possessed\nby me at the time of writing. But the statements are not\ndefinite, and at best the script seems to have confused two\nincidents. The facts are as follows :\nMy brother in law, Hugh Verrall, who had been ill, was to\ngo abroad for a rest and change in September, 1903, and\nthe Italian Lakes was the suggested locality. This I heard\nof about Aug. 22. He started in fact on Oct. 9, by Paris,\nand reached the Italian Lakes after a slow journey and many\nstoppings ; he returned to England early in December.\nEarly in November, 1903, my husband and I began to con\nsider the suggestion of his doctor that we should go to Algeria\nfor the Christmas vacation, taking the journey out and back\nas fast as possible so as to secure the utmost possible time\nin Algeria. On Dec. 1, however, he decided to apply for\n1 See App., p. 403.\n\fLIII.] References to Living Acquaintances. 191\nleave of absence for the Lent Term of 1904, and go away\nfor three or four months, so as to avoid undue haste on the\njourneys. This we did, reaching our destination on Dec. 16.\nThere were thus two journeys taken abroad for health\nby two members of the Verrall family in the autumn of\n1903, one expected and one unexpected in August, 1903.\nOf these five statements in the script :\n(1) states the facts about Hugh correctly.\n(2) goes on to speak of a \" hurried \" journey\u2014a phrase not\nthe least applicable to the very slow journey to the Lakes\nwhich was contemplated, as I knew, for Hugh\u2014and, in\nconnexion with this journey, of a \" long break.\" The long\nbreak and the journey to the south are strictly applicable to\nArthur's actual journey, while the hurried journey to the\nsouth is appropriate to what was first recommended by our\ndoctor, and was contemplated by us during the month of\nNovember.\n(3) seems superfluous if it means that Arthur was not to be\ntold of Hugh's movements, but has a certain appropriateness if\napplied to Arthur's journey. My husband was unwilling to go\naway at all, and the whole question was as little discussed\nas possible, our ultimate decision being taken only ten days\nbefore we left home.\n(4) indicates error, though not complete error, in what\nhad been said before.\n(5) unintelligible if referred to Hugh, is quite correct if\napplied to Arthur's journey.\nIf this interpretation is correct, the script shows knowledge,\nconfused though it be, of what it was wholly impossible that\nat the time of writing I should consciously know. At the\ntime, however, I took it to refer to the journey of my brother-\nin-law, the only journey then in contemplation for any member\nof the family.\nScript of Oct. 3, 1904,\nI find it impossible to classify this incident ; the reader\nmust judge whether or not there was any justification for\nthe evident belief of the script that it had this time made\na hit.\n\f192 Chapter IX. [PART\nOn October 3, 1904, I went to town for the day. On the\nway, in the train (10 a.m. from Cambridge), just after passing\nHatfield, my hand wrote :\nDisappointments many but the end is sure. Now this is an\nomen an omen in the proper sense.

I asked my husband\non my return if \" White \" answered to anything which had\nbeen in his thoughts, but he said it did not.

He was much surprised to\nhear that I had seen him in London at 11.20 a.m., but\non consideration said that he could not assert that the man\nhe saw in Cambridge was Mr. White, though he should certainly\nhave asserted it but for my seeing him in town. For Mr.\nWhite to have been where my husband thought he saw him\nbefore 4 p.m. he must have left London at latest by the\n12.40 p.m., which as he only reached it at 11.20 seems\nunlikely. It is probable, therefore, that my husband was\nmistaken in his impression, and the remarks of the script in\nthat case served to show his error.

[PART\nOn July 17th, 1901, an attempt was made to say some\nthing of evidential value for Mrs. Sidgwick, but it was a\ncomplete failure and recalled nothing to her.1\nOn July 23rd, 1901;, the script seems to have been more\nsuccessful. It wrote\nSidgwick wants to say something about a message\u2014a missing\nbook. It ought to be found. It had dates in it-^a little book\nkept by accident\u2014there was something else in it.

On August 3rd she told me that she had found\none with leaves torn out, containing on its remaining leaves\ndated notes referring to a certain incident. Other papers\nreferring to this incident were destroyed before Dr. Sidgwick's\ndeath, but the notes in this book were apparently left\nundestroyed by accident.\nSix of the statements, two non-evidential, two false state\nments, and two failures2 seem to refer to a proposed\n\"test\" of some kind. On October 10th, 1903, the script\nsuggested that Mrs. Sidgwick should be asked for a question\nconcerning Dr. Sidgwick to which only she knew the answer.\nThe script had for some time been writing about letters\napparently from or to Dr. Sidgwick and kept by Mrs. Sidgwick,\nbut the connexion between these letters and the proposed\ntest-question was obscure. On October 12th more was said\nabout the letters, and in , the next paragraph the script\nsaid \" Don't ask Mrs. Sidgwick yet.\" Early in December,\n1903, I left England for Algeria. The script wrote on\nDecember 25th: \"Mrs. Sidgwick would know about the three\nletters in the cabinet\"; and on December 26th: \"Mrs.\nSidgwick knows the letters in the cabinet, ask her.\"\nOn January 17th, 1904, it made further remarks about\n1 See below, p. 278.\n2 The statements have not yet. been tested.\n\ftin.] References to Living Acquaintances. 195\n\"Mrs. Sidgwick's letter\" and its contents, and OH July 13th,\n1904, came a statement that an envelope containing a short\nsentence written by Dr. Sidgwick was kept with two other\nletters in \" the Florentine cabinet.\" 1\nThe above allusions are too obscure for verification ; the last\ntwp seem to refer to a sealed envelope to be opened post\nhumously, but the two in December, 1903, may refer to something\nquite different. Mrs. Sidgwick knows nothing of three letters\nkept together, so that the two statements in December,\n1903, are classified as false. The remarks of October 10th\nand 12th,2 1903, are, as they stand, unevidential, but may\nbe connected with matter purporting, though so far unsuccess\nfully, to be evidential. The script of October 10th apparently\nsupposes a connexion between the test-question and the letters\nthat have been preserved.\nOne of these allusions to Mrs. Sidgwick (April 27, 1901)\nis more interesting and may perhaps justify its claim to\nevidential value.

But at the time I did not identify the room.\nMrs. Sidgwick, to whom I referred the first sentences of April\n27th, could make nothing of them. On May 18th I spoke\nof the matter to Miss Johnson, in consequence of the veri\nfication that day of another statement in the script of\nMay 8th,1 and she suggested that the description applied\nto Mrs. Sidgwick's room at Newnham College with which I\nwas, of course, familiar. The window-seat, which is on the left-\nhand side of the room to a person going from the door to the\nfireplace, is fitted with cushions and had at the time a\nvalance made of a stuff of which the ground was blue. This I\ndid not remember, my impression being that the covering was\nyellow, a colour which I find it originally had, but some time\nbefore 1901 the coverings had been renewed with a stuff\nof which blue was an important part. By the window\nstands a table on which there are generally one or more\njars with flowers; on May 18th when I looked at the room\nthere was a jar filled with wallflowers. Near the table is\nan arm-chair. On the opposite wall are book-cases, and\nover one of these is a framed portrait of Dr. Sidgwick. There\nis in the room a chest of drawers with a pattern inlaid in\nwood, and metal handles, but the handles are not of the\nshape drawn in the script. This chest is Florentine, having\nbeen obtained at Florence and given to Mrs. Sidgwick as\na wedding present by two of her brothers. These facts about\nthe chest were quite unknown to me till I made enquiries\non May 18th, 1901.\nMrs. Sidgwick told me, on May 18th, that under the\ndrapery of the window-seat she kept a box containing im\nportant papers, but she could think of nothing in the box cor\nresponding to the description in the script. It was not till\nJanuary 1st, 1905, that I ascertained on further enquiry\nfrom Mrs. Sidgwick that among the papers in that box was\na privately printed pamphlet in a sealed envelope, given to Dr.\nSidgwick some years before. This sealed packet was taken\ncharge of by Mrs. Sidgwick in 1893, but she did not know\nwhat it contained, and had so completely forgotten all about\nit, that, as she wrote to me, \" I was not aware of having\n1 See pp. 207-209.\n\f198 .

The description of the large steamer\u2014not a\nman-of-war\u2014coming to England had suggested to me Dr.\nHodgson, who, as I knew, was expected in England about the\nmiddle or end of July. But I expected him to come straight\nto Cambridge, and in fact he did.\nOn July 30th the script, after my return to England,\nmade what appeared to be an addition to the above or a correc\ntion of it ; for though Sir Oliver Lodge's name does not occur,\nthe word \"notare\" is repeated and is followed by the words,\nobviously alluding to the \"five days\" of the script of July 23 :\nYou have it not quite right. Try again. . . . Ask if on the\n28th that makes 5 days.\nThe name is wrong. Thaumas is more like but I can't\nget it.\nThe first sentence, written before I had heard from Sir Oliver\nLodge or knew anything of Dr. Hodgson's movements, I took\nto be a correction of the name Hodgson in the earlier script.\nThe remark about \" Thaumas,\" beginning as it did a new\nparagraph, I took to be a new incident, as I had learnt by\nthis time that a new paragraph invariably indicated a change\nof subject. But as the only person indicated for reference\nwas Sir Oliver Lodge, plainly referred to in the first paragraph,\nI wrote to him to ask \" if the name Thaumas had any meaning\nfor him.\"\nThere were thus two points referred to Sir Oliver Lodge :\n(a) the statement of July 23rd, which I took to be substantially\nbut not wholly correct, and (&) the reference to \" Thaumas \" on\nJuly 30th. The facts were as follows:\n(a) On July 31st I heard from Sir Oliver Lodge that the\nremark about \" something of importance \" having happened\nseemed intelligible to him, and that in connexion with it some\none had come to him from America, reaching Birmingham on\nJuly 28th, i.e. five days after the 23rd, though the ship must\nhave \"reached the shores\" of England on the 27th.

Thomas applied to\nMr. Piddington for the post of Organising Secretary to the\nS.P.R., and gave my husband's name as a reference. Mr.\nPiddington sent the letter on to Sir Oliver Lodge, who received\nit on July 31st.

Mr. Thomas had been\nwell known to us when he was in Cambridge, but we had\nno knowledge of his occupation or intentions.

In that case it directly purports to represent one\nof Mrs. Thompson's controls, Mrs. Cartwright.\n\f202 Chapter tx. [PART\nI sent the above script to Mr. Piddington as directed, and\nlearnt from him that Mrs. Thompson took her daughter Rosie\nto school at Bournemouth1 on May 7th, 1902, and saw her there\nagain on May 9th. On Friday and Saturday, May 16th and\n17th, Rosie Thompson was in bed with a bad cold and neuralgia.\nA letter from her on May 20th to her mother says that she\ncame down to dinner on Sunday 18th, and went back to bed\nat 4.30. But as she is rather subject to bad colds, her mother\nwas not anxious. The script then was apparently justified\nin saying that to Rosie Thompson something had happened\njust lately at the school which was not cause for alarm.\nBut the incident is not distinctive enough for evidential\npurposes.\n2. On October 7th, 1903, after writing about some letters\nof Dr. Sidgwick's, the scribe added in a new paragraph the\nwords : \" Tell Piddington to ask Mrs. Thompson about\nSidgwick's three envelopes.\" I sent this message to Mr.\nPiddington by the evening post of October 7th. At the\ntime I knew nothing of his plans nor of Mrs. Thompson's.\nI heard from Mr. Piddington on October 8th that he had an\nappointment to see Mrs. Thompson on that afternoon, and- so\nan opportunity to ask the question. That evening, after I\nhad heard from Mr. Piddington, the scribe wrote : \" Mrs.\nThompson does not know those letters, but what Piddington\nhears from her will help you to understand.\" It was true\nthat Mrs. Thompson did not know of the letters, but nothing\nthat she said to , Mr. Piddington has thrown any light on the\nletters.\nDr. Hodgson. 40 cases.\nRather more than half of the large number of references\nto Dr. Hodgson are of a vague and non-evidential character,\neven when an attempt at evidential matter may be detected.\nOn the other hand the proportion of successes among the\nwould-be evidential cases is high, and some of the successes\nare striking. Twenty-three of the references are of the following\ntype : \" Hodgson will be a help,\" \" Hodgson is pleased,\" \" you\nshould see Hodgson,\" \" Hodgson will understand,\" \" I should\nlike Hodgson to know this.\" In four cases there is a sug-\n1 I knew that Rosie Thompson was going to school after Easter.\n\fLIII.] References to Living Acquaintances. 203\ngestion, sometimes amounting to a statement, that Dr. Hodgson\nwould be in England and able to see the script. This has\nnot been the case, so that the whole script has never been\nshown to Dr. Hodgson, though he was informed of all actual\nreferences to himself.\nA definite message was apparently intended for Dr. Hodgson\non December 12th, 1901, and I sent him the following words:\nIn hoc signo vincit amor.*\nTell Hodgson the last.\nThey had -no significance for him. They were however preceded\nby the words : \" Crosses three + + + and a dividing line ,\"\nand it is possible that it was intended to refer to the use of\nKector's Greek cross.1 But as I had attached no significance\nat that- time to the cross, Greek or otherwise, I did not send\nthe words about the crosses to Dr. Hodgson.\nIt is probable that the same thing happened in other\ninstances, and that things remain unintelligible to me which\nwould have been found to have a meaning had they been\nshown to Dr. Hodgson. Even in the case of the successful\nreferences to Dr. Hodgson, though I. have letters from him\nconfirming the statements of the script, the letters do not\ncontain the details necessary for the reader's comprehension of\nthe incidents. I had hoped to obtain these from Dr. Hodgson,\nwhen he had read the proofs of this paper, but his death in\nDecember, 1905, has deprived me of his help.

[PART\nGENERAL COMMENT ON ABOVE.\nIn the above chaos it is difficult to see any order, and\nany attempt to draw general conclusions would be mislead\ning. But two points may be emphasised,\u2014the comparative\nnarrowness of the field of selection, and the want of uni\nformity as to results. The narrowness of the field has been\nnoticed above, and may no doubt be explained by some\nprocess of unconscious selection.\nNo less noteworthy is the variation in the type of remark\nmade about the selected persons, and for this it is difficult\nto account by any process of selection, conscious or unconscious.\nWhy, for instance, should the remarks concerning Mrs. Dew\nSmith be almost without exception interesting while those\nabout Dr. and Mrs. Leaf1 are wholly valueless ? Again, why\nis there so marked a difference in the evidential value of\nthe references respectively to my husband and my daughter ?\nIt is not likely that my own impression or expectation\nwould account for the marked difference. I should have\nprima facie anticipated greater success in obtaining tele\npathic connexion with my daughter than with my husband,\nfor whereas my husband has no automatic faculty whatever,\nthere is reason to believe that such faculty is possessed by\nmy daughter, and it is certain that success has attended\nexperiments in thought-transference between her and me.2\nAnd yet out of the thirty-four references to my husband,\nten (or, excluding the special experiment tried by him, out\nof twenty-three, four) are at least partially correct, whereas\nonly one of the eighteen similar references to my daughter\nis of any interest at all. Among the other persons mentioned,\nDr. Hodgson's name is connected with a greater number of\nsuccesses than any other. These are points for consideration ;\nI have no explanation to suggest.\n1 References by name to these intimate friends of mine are four,\ncounted above under (F) as two non-evidential and two false state\nments.

I use this phrase in\na perfectly general sense, to include crystal-gazing, planchette\nor pen-writing, trance utterances, etc.; in fact all the forms of\nsensory and motor automatism, without any pre-judgment as\nto the cause of those phenomena. In a paper, of which the\nmain purpose is the classification of observed facts, it seems\nwiser to unite in a separate group references to persons\ndistinguished from the majority by the habitual production\nof automatic phenomena.1\nThe next two chapters deal with references in the script to\nfour sensitives.\nAs I have stated above, I am not here dealing with\nexperimental cases, and shall therefore say nothing of the\nwriting obtained when definite experiments were made with\ntwo other automatists. Nor shall I discuss some apparently\nspontaneous connexions between my script and the automatic\nwriting of a lady with whom at the suggestion of Miss Johnson\nI subsequently attempted some experiments in the summer of\n1905, but of whose name I was then ignorant and whose\nacquaintance I made only in November, 1905. There seems\nno doubt that \" cross-correspondences \" exist between her\nautomatic writing and mine, but the examination and discussion\n'I say \"habitual,\" as I believe the possession of the faculty to\nbe much commoner than is generally supposed.

Any attempt therefore at classification in our\npresent state of knowledge would, I conceive, be mischievous,\nand I shall relate these incidents in chronological order.\n(1) MRS. ARCHDALE.\nOn October 25th, 1901, Mr. Piddington told me about a,\nlady, Mrs. Archdale, who was obtaining automatic writing.\nHe suggested that I should try to obtain in my script a word\nto be reproduced in Mrs. Archdale's writing. As I had never\nheard of the lady before this, the experiment, if successful,\nwould be interesting. A day or two later Mr. Piddington\nwrote to me giving me some details to help in the experi\nment, and mentioned that the name of the supposed control\nof Mrs. Archdale, her son, was Stewart. T remembered that\nthe name had occurred in my script in a passage conveying\nno meaning to me, and I accordingly looked it up and sent\nit to Mr. Piddington. It was as follows : September 18th, 1901.\nWomen are bound or abound. Stewart and Haslemere\u2014what\ndo they here 1 Hazelrigg is better.\nOn November 4th I heard from him : \" There is a clear\nconnection between Stewart Archdale and Haslemere. Hazelrigg\nseems to be an attempt to mention another name connected\n\fLin.] Cross-Correspondences with other Sensitives. 207\nwith the boy's life, but the association is quite distinct\nfrom Haslemere. Hazelrigg is nearly, but not quite, right\"\nThis seemed promising; the three names had occurred in\nthe script five weeks before I heard of Mrs. Archdale, but after\nMr. Piddington had -made her acquaintance, although he knew\nnothing of any connexion between Stewart and Haslemere, or\nof the other name- suggested by Hazelrigg. But no further\ndevelopment occurred.1\n(2) MRS. THOMPSON.\nThe name of Mrs. Thompson occurs with some frequency\nin the script throughout the years 1901, 1902, and 1903. In\nthat there is nothing remarkable. I sat with Mrs. Thompson2\nfrequently in the two years preceding the inception of my\nscript, and was much impressed with the value and interest\nof her trance utterances. Like all her friends I was sorry to\nlearn, as I did from her in the middle of March, 1901, that\nshe was going to give no more sittings.\nThe first four references to Mrs. Thompson make parts of\na single episode. They are as follows :\n(1) May 1st, 1901.\nBefore 17th it is easier now to write.\n(2) May 3rd, 1901.\nROSA THOMPson could perhaps but I don't know.\n(3) May 8th, 1901.\nNescio quid3 interponit se tuae menti mihi que.

[PART\n(4) May llth, 1901.\nBefore the 17th wait Rosa Thompson will speak\u2014Lodge will\ntell you. Wait. Do not hurry date this.\nThe script on May 8th was written between 10 and\n10.30 p.m. The following note was made on May 9th, 9.45 a.m.,\nwhen I copied the script into the book: \"I thought that,\nafter the Greek, I was looking at the face of a clock, the\ntime being 10.25 ; I fancied that I was drawing this, but had\nno idea that I had written the words, ' clock and time.' The\nwords ' falsehood . . . away ' are in quite a different [and\nunknown] hand.\"\nIt is clear, and I recognised it at the time, that two asser\ntions are made in the above four extracts, viz. (I) that before\nthe 17th 1 Mrs. Thompson would say something of which I\nshould hear through Sir Oliver Lodge, and (2) further, that\non May 8th at 10.25 p.m. a \"control,\" claiming to be H., a\nfriend of mine, was \"communicating\" elsewhere.2\nAs noted above, I knew that Mrs. Thompson was not giving\nsittings, and I in no way associated her with the remarks of\nmy script on May 8th, where, as will be observed, there is no\nmention of names either of persons or places. The expectation\nthat I formed, so far as I formed any, from the remarks of\nthe script on May 1, 3, 8, and 11, 1901, was that I was to be\ninformed by Sir Oliver Lodge at the Council meeting on May\n17th of something learnt by him from the normal Mrs. Thompson\n\u2014not her trance-personality\u2014and that some medium had\nreceived an ostensible communication from H. just before\n10.30 p.m. on May 8th.\nThe facts are these: Mrs. Thompson, of whose movements\nI knew nothing, went to stay in Birmingham in May, and\n!May 17th was the date of the next Council meeting of the S.P.R.\n2 For first assertion see script of May 1, May 11, and perhaps\nMay 3 ; for second assertion see May 8. The suggestions on May 1\nthat something is to happen 'before 17th,' and on May 3 that\n\" Mrs. Thompson would perhaps \" do something, are combined and\ndefined on May 11, and reinforced by the statement that I shall\nhear of Mrs. Thompson's speaking from Sir Oliver Lodge. This is\na characteristic instance of the development of an incident in the\nscript, of which I have spoken above, p. 56.\n\ftin.] Cross-Correspondences with other Sensitives. 209\ndined with Sir Oliver and Lady Lodge on May 8th, 1901.\nUnexpectedly and spontaneously she went into trance between\n9 and 10.30 p.m., and was \" controlled,\" not only by the usual\nNelly, but also by H. In the course of the sitting this\nlatter ' control ' used the words \" falsehood creeping in,\" and\nsaid that some one was \" calling him \" elsewhere. Quite at\nthe end of the sitting, which concluded at 10.30, Nelly repeated\nthat some one was at that moment (\" now \") calling H.\nI learnt of this sitting in the following manner : On May\n14th I had a letter from Mr. Piddington in which occurred\na phrase suggesting that Sir Oliver Lodge had lately seen\nMrs. Thompson. On May 17th, at the S.P.R. Council Meeting,\nSir Oliver Lodge was not present, but Mr. Piddington then\ngave me Sir Oliver Lodge's notes of the sitting with Mrs.\nThompson on May 8th, which he thought it would interest\nme to read.1\nIt will thus be seen that the two assertions of the script\nwere justified; (1) before the 17th Mrs. Thompson did speak,\nas I learnt from the notes of Sir Oliver Lodge; (2) on\nMay 8th, at 10.25 p.m., the H. 'control ' was ostensibly occupied\nin communicating elsewhere, as recorded in those notes. A few\nmore instances of such \" cross-correspondences \" as these would\ngreatly strengthen the evidence for telepathy.\nThe next two references to Mrs. Thompson on May 28th\nand June 23rd, 1901, are unintelligible. On May 28th, in the\nmidst of a confused statement, came the words \" the date is\nimportant\u2014get it right. Through Mrs. Thompson.\" But nothing\nhas been discovered to throw light on this script. On June 23rd\nthe words, \" Mrs. Thompson : Lodge will understand,\" were inter\njected without reference to the context.\nSome vague allusions to the probability of Mrs. Thompson's\nresuming sittings before long followed in the next few months.\nBut it was not till after I had seen Mrs. Thompson, at a\nmeeting of the S.P.R., when I read a paper about my script,\nthat the script contained a definite reference to her. After\nthe meeting on April 20th, 1903, as we were parting, Mrs.\nThompson asked me to try for automatic writing between\n9 and 10 in the evening of April 22nd. I understood that\n1 Mr. Piddington knew nothing about my script of May 8th.\n\f210 Chapter X. [PART\nshe would try something similar at the same hour. On that\nevening I obtained automatic writing and also Planchette-\nwriting with my daughter. The script produced soon after\n9 was as follows :\nThere is some one with Mrs. Thompson, another woman, taller\nand slighter\u2014she helps her to write\u2014the message is not clear to\nyou. I do not know the house. I cannot take you there.\nLater, on April 30th, 1903, before I had heard anything\nfrom Mr. Piddington, who was to act as intermediary between\nMrs. Thompson and me, my script produced another obvious\nallusion to the same incident in the words :\nMrs. Thompson named a name, but not yours\u2014Nelly could help\nif she could come\u2014she finds it hard to write, and would easily\nspeak.\nOn May 1st I heard from Mr. Piddington that on the evening\nof Wednesday, April 22nd, Mrs. Thompson and a friend, unknown\nto me, a taller and slighter woman than Mrs. Thompson, had\ntaken part in experiments in the rooms of the S.P.R. During\nthose experiments the name of my daughter was mentioned by\nMrs. Thompson, but my own name was not. Mrs. Thompson\nknew nothing of my daughter's experiments in automatic writ\ning, and no one but ourselves knew that on the evening in\nquestion, April 22nd, my daughter tried Planchette with me, and\nalso obtained script alone. It appears then that the statements\nof the script of April 22nd and 30th, 1903, were true as far\nas they went, and they were certainly quite contrary to my\nown impression. I had no idea that Mrs. Thompson was\ntaking part in any experiment, and fully expected that\nat the hour arranged she would be alone and at her own\nhouse.\nIt is possible to see in a piece of script written on Friday,\nApril 24th, 1903, an attempt to describe the rooms at Hanover\nSquare as the locality indicated in the preceding script of April\n22. After the word \" Wensday \" (so spelt) it went on :\nthe case has been identified\u2014but they wait for more about the\nroom. There is a portrait hanging near the fire. Edmund Gurney\nbooks in cases in the room\u2014no coloured picture.\n\fLIII.] Crosa-Correspondencen with other Sensitives. 211\nThose who know the rooms in Hanover Square will recognise\nthe intention in the above, and April 22nd, the day of the\nexperiment with Mrs. Thompson, was a Wednesday.\nTwo references in October, 1903, to an incident already\ndescribed,1 two unevidential allusions, and one vague and\nunverifiable statement complete the list of references to Mrs.\nThompson.\nThere are two allusions in the script to one of Mrs. Thomp\nson's trance-personalities, a certain Mrs. Cartwright.2 The\nfirst, on November 25th, 1901, comes after an apparent attempt\nto produce something evidential.\nA solicitor known to a friend of yours. Hugh Chesson at some\nplace that ends in Chester\u2014Godmanchester perhaps. It is Mrs.\nCartwright writing\u2014I have found her.\nBut nothing has been made of these names. The other refer\nence to Mrs. Cartwright is perhaps more intelligible, though\nhere, too, it is at best doubtful whether there is any real\nintention in the confused phrases of the script. As, however,\nthis paper is a record, not of successes but of incidents, I will\ndescribe this tangled story.\nOn February 1st, 1904, after other matter the script wrote\ntwo separate paragraphs as follows :\nWrite the sound. Fin is ill 3\u2014Fin do you not hear 1 R get the\nnext word for me. Fin-sway that is the sound\u2014listen again fin\nsway out in on say that write that sound in sense. Outinon.

It is a sudden illness which she sees will come to\nher sister\u2014this is Mrs. Cartwright speaking\u2014she wants you to know.\nNot in her own house in london, somewhere else. Tell someone this.\nThis was followed by the remark :\nWe had another message but this was urgent\u2014write to-morrow\nfor ours.\nIt is possible that the two paragraphs of the script are\nunconnected ; the second paragraph does not contain the word\n!See p. 202. \"See S.P.R. Proc., Vol. XVII., p. 184.\n3 Words in italics are in a larger character.\n4 Before \" let \" are some illegible strokes.\n\f212 Chapter X. [PART\n\"Fin,\" which is apparently the leading word in the first. On\nthe other hand, the larger handwriting is of the same type\nthroughout both paragraphs, and the notion of illness occurs\nin both. The second paragraph, with its mention of Mrs.\nCartwright, plainly alludes to Mrs. Thompson, but it is not\nclear whose sister is to have an illness. My impression,\nrecorded before any attempt at verification, was that the\nintention of this second paragraph is to suggest that \"Nelly\"\nis announcing the approaching sudden illness of her sister, an\nillness which is to occur not in Mrs. Thompson's London house.\nThe R, the initial of Mrs. Thompson's Christian name as well\nas of that of her eldest daughter, taken in conjunction with the\nsimilarity of the larger handwriting, suggests a closer connexion\nbetween the two paragraphs than is otherwise apparent. But\nthe first paragraph seemed wholly inapplicable to Mrs. Thomp\nson until I heard from her on August 2nd, 1904, after a long\ngap in our correspondence, \"you will be surprised to hear we\nare leaving London and going into the country (Finchley).\"\nIt then occurred to me as possible that in the earlier paragraph\nthere was an attempt\u2014confused and fragmentary at best\u2014to\nallude to the removal of Mrs. Thompson out of London to\nFinchley, represented by the words \" Fin is way out.\" But\nthis is very uncertain, and even if this suggestion were accepted,\nan explanation is still to seek of the supposed prophecy of\nsudden illness to Miss Rosie Thompson not in her own house\nin London.\nI have recently (May, 1906) ascertained from Mrs. Thompson\nthat the idea of moving to Finchley was not entertained till\nearly in the summer of 1904, and that the actual move was\nmade in December, 1904. Mrs. Thompson also informs me\nthat Miss Rosie Thompson has had only one sudden illness\nin her life ; that was in June, 1905, when she was staying in\nher uncle's house in Birmingham. The illness was very sudden,\nand Miss Thompson's father was sent for. As soon as she\ncould be moved, Mr. Thompson brought her home to Finchley.\n(3) MRS. PIPER.\nI have separated, so far as I could, the allusions to Mrs.\nPiper and to her trance-personalities from the allusions to\n\fLIII.] Cross-Correspondences with other Sensitives. 213\nDr. Hodgson. The first occasion on which there appears in\nthe script anything possibly bearing on statements in Mrs\nPiper's trance1 is December 10th, 1901.\nBetwixt dark and light a grey figure in the bedroom not [to\nbe feared]2 you will see on an anniversary\u2014note the date\u2014this\nyear. Put the [conversation],2 on [paper]2 that is all I can\nsee. Try other nights.\nNo grey figure was seen by me, or as far as I can ascer\ntain, by any member of my household on any date, anniversary\nor otherwise, in 1901. On January 28th, 1902, in Mrs. Piper's\nsitting3 a reference was made by the control to a \"vision\"\nof a figure which it was said had been seen by my daughter\nwhen she was not asleep, but in a bedroom. The date of the\nsupposed \" vision \" was not definitely stated, but referred to as\nrecent.\nNo trace of such appearance to my daughter4 or myself has\nbeen found. The script of December 10th, 1901, warning me of\nthe possibility of some such appearance makes it probable that\nI should have noted any impression, however slight, of the\nsort. There is however possibly a \" cross-correspondence \"\nbetween the reference of my script on December 10th to an\napparition that was to be\u2014an apparition \" betwixt dark and\nlight in a bedroom\"\u2014and the statement of Mrs. Piper's trance\npersonality on January 28th, 1902, that part of a figure had\nbeen visible to my daughter in a bedroom when she was not\nasleep. My script contains no other references to apparitions.\nThe next incident is of a very different type, being one of\nthe most striking instances of a cross-correspondence that has\noccurred in my experience. On January 31st, 1902, I had\nbeen lunching with Mr. Piddington in town, and after the\narrival of Sir Oliver Lodge from Birmingham, was about to\nwalk with them to the S.P.R. Council Meeting at 3 p.m.,\n1 I should say that I have seen very few records of Mrs. Piper's\nunpublished sittings.\n2 Words in brackets almost undecipherable.\n3 I quote from the report of a sitting on January 28th, 1902,\nsent by Dr. Hodgson.\n4 For possible confusion between me and my daughter, see follow\ning incident.\n\f214 Chapter X. [PART\nwhen I felt suddenly so strong a desire to write that I came\ndown and made an excuse1 for not accompanying the gentle\nmen, saying I would drive later. As soon as they had started\nI wrote automatically in the dining-room the following words :\nPanopticon <r<t>aipas emTaAAei vvvBey\/j.a \/jLV(TTIKJIV. ri OVK JSiSa>s -,\nvolatile ferrum\u2014pro telo impinget.\nA few more words were added, when I was interrupted\nby Mr. Piddington, who had returned, in order to drive with\nme to the meeting. All the rest of the day I felt a wish\nto write, and finally in the train on the way home to Cam\nbridge more script was produced. That script2 contained no\nverifiable statement but was signed with two crosses, one of\nthem being the Greek cross definitely stated elsewhere in the\nscript to be the sign of Rector.3\nThe curious opening words interested my husband, who saw\nthem on February 1st, 1902, as well as myself, but we could\nnot find any application for the Greek (or quasi-Greek)\nthough the meaning is pretty clear. Panopticon is not a\nGreek word, and it is difficult to make out what it is sup\nposed to mean, beyond saying that it contains the ideas of\n\" universal \" (irav) and \" seeing \" (OTTTIKOV). It is noticeable\nthat this word, apparently but not really Greek, is written in\nRoman letters, the genuine words next after it being written\nin Greek characters. The word cmrdXXei, \" tends, cherishes,\nfosters,\" is not a common one, though it occurs in Homer,\nTheocritus, and Pindar ; * a-vvSey\/j-a is not an existing Greek\nword, but is legitimately formed as a noun from the verb\n<5e'xo\/uaj, \" I receive,\" compounded with the preposition crw,\n\"with,\" and means \"joint-reception\" or \"common reception.\"\nThe whole sentence therefore seems to mean that some sort\nof universal seeing \" of a sphere fosters .the mystic joint-\nreception.\"\n1 The original account of this incident, written in 1902, bears\non the margin corroborative notes by Sir Oliver Lodge and Mr.\nPiddington.\n\"The whole script will be found in App., p. 404.\n3 See above, p. 78.\n4 Pindar, Nem. 3. 99. Fennell there translates it \"developes.\"\n\fLIII.] Gross-Correspondences with other Sensitives. 215\nThe next words mean \"Why did you not give1 it?\" The\nLatin words may be translated : \" the flying iron\u2014ferrum\n(iron) for telum (weapon)\u2014will hit.\"\nThe Latin words suggested the hurling of a spear, and on\nFebruary 7th, 1902, after looking up some passages, I noted\nthat volatile ferrum is used by Virgil for a spear. The more\ncommon phrase, volatile telum, which is used by Lucretius\nand Ovid for a spear, is also applied by Ovid to an arrow.2\nI therefore took this passage to refer to a \" spear,\" described\nas \"the winged iron,\"\u2014to use Virgil's variant on the common\nphrase, volatile telum\u2014and recorded this interpretation.\nSo far for what happened in England. In Boston, as I\nsubsequently learned, the following took place. At Mrs. Piper's\nsitting3 on January 28th, 1902, after the reference to my\ndaughter's supposed vision,4 Dr. Hodgson suggested that the\nsame \"control\" should try to impress my daughter in the\ncourse of the next week with a scene or object. The control\nassented. Dr. Hodgson said : \" Can you try and make Helen\nsee you holding a spear in your hand?\" The control asked:\n*' Why a sphere ? \" Dr. Hodgson repeated \" spear,\" and the\ncontrol accepted the suggestion, and said the experiment should\nbe tried for a week. On February 4th, 1902, at the next\nsitting, and therefore at the very first opportunity, the con\ntrol claimed to have been successful in making himself visible\nto Helen Verrall with a \" sphear \" (so spelt in the trance\nwriting). The confusion between the \" sphere \" and \" spear \"\n,of January 28th seems to have been persistent, at least in the\n1 The script is not perfectly clear ; the word may be e&'Sus or\n,eSi&ovs, but the two forms are equivalent in meaning.\n2 There is some difference of opinion among commentators as to\nthe exact weapon described in the various passages referred to.\nThe above comment represents the conclusion to which I came on\nFebruary 7th, 1902, as noted on that day.\n3 Communications at these sittings were made by means of Mrs.\nPiper's right hand, writing automatically, the usual \"control\" being\n\u2022\" Rector \" acting as intermediary for other specified communicators.\nThe reader will find a full account of the methods of the recent\nphenomena in Prof. Hyslop's account of sittings with Mrs. Piper\nin S.P.R. Proc., Vol. XVI.\n4 See immediately above.\n\f216 Chapter X. [PART\nmind of the medium, and to have produced the combination\n\" sphear.\"\nTo the best of my knowledge, my name had never been\nmentioned by Mrs. Piper since her return to America in 1889,\ntill during the sittings that began in January, 1902. The first\nintimation that my name or my daughter's had been men\ntioned by her reached me on February 8th, 1902, from Sir\nOliver Lodge. On February 13th I received a letter from\nDr. Hodgson, enclosing the report of the sitting of January\n28th. The report of the sitting on February 4th reached\nme on February 18th. Thus no news at all of Mrs. Piper's\nsittings came to me till after February 7th,1 the day on which\nI recorded my impression that the Latin allusion in my script\nwas to a spear ; the Greek allusion to a sphere is beyond\nquestion. In no previous writing of mine had there been any\nallusion to a spear ; the word \" sphere \" occurred once before\nin a very unintelligible early writing on March 14th, 1901,\nthere too in conjunction with the word \"panopticon.\" In\nview of this it is perhaps worth noting that the suggestion-\nof a sphere as the object to be shown came not from Dr.\nHodgson, but from the \"control.\"\nTo sum up then : on January 28th, 1902, during Mrs. Piper's\ntrance, a suggestion was made that a spear or sphere should\nbe shown to my daughter, and on February 4th the experi\nment with the \" sphear \" was said to have been made with\nsuccess. On January 31st, between those dates, my script (as\ninterpreted by me at the time) said that the seeing of a\nsphere effected a mysterious \"co-reception,\" and associated this\nstatement with a reference to a spear. It seems to me that,\nthough the proposed experiment did not succeed in the way\nintended, there is strong reason for thinking that my script\nwas in some way affected by it. The reader will note that\nthe connexion between my script of Jan. 31 and the Piper\n!At this time I had not begun the practice of sending the\noriginal script to Sir Oliver Lodge. The evidence, therefore, for\nits production at the date stated is not corroborated by the post\nmark. My husband saw the script on February 1st; on February\n1st I copied it into my notebook, and on February 7th I noted on\nthe opposite page the Virgilian use of volatile ferrum. I always\nnote dates of any entry in the book containing copies of the script.\n\fLIII.] Cross-Correspondences with other Sensitives. 217\nsittings is made perfectly clear by the signature of my script,\nwhich introduces Rector's Greek cross.1\nThe following arrangement perhaps helps to mark the\nsequence of dates :\nSTATEMENT IN PARALLEL COLUMNS.\nMrs. P., Boston, U.S.A.\nJan 28. \"Spear & Sphere suggested.\"\nFeb 4. \" Sphear \" claimed.\nJan\nMrs. V., England.\n31. \" <rif>aipS.s, volatile ferrum. '\nThe next three allusions to Mrs. Piper (March to July,\n1902) are not evidential.\nThere was no further reference, direct or indirect, to Mrs.\nPiper till the spring of 1903. On March 15th, 1903, and again\non March 17, attempts were made to produce a word, and\nas these were followed by the remark, \" but Hodgson would\nunderstand much that you write he must see it,\" though there\nwas no direct reference to Mrs. Piper, I took the script as alluding\nto her. On April 17th further attempts were made at what was\nsaid to be \" the pass-word,\" and from later allusions it appeared\nthat \" the pass-word \" was intended for Dr. Hodgson. It was\nnot till some months later, September, 1903, that I learnt from\nDr. Hodgson, that on March 10th, 1903, a new pass-word had\nbeen given in Mrs. Piper's trance for reproduction by other\nautomatists, as closely related to the suggestion in my script\nof March 15th, 1903, as, \"say, ella to welda.\"\nThe last allusion to Mrs. Piper, on February 1st, 1904, is\ncorrect, but unimportant.\nI take separately the allusions to Mrs. Piper's trance-\npersonalities. On July 21st, 1903, to a long evidential message\nsigned E.G., the following words were added :\nRector fecit per interpretationem. posuit signum suum ipse.*\n* \" Rector has done it by explanation (or perhaps by means of\ninterpretation, i.e. using an interpreter) ; he himself has set his seal.\"\n!See above, pp. 78-80.\n\f218 Chapter X.

On November 22nd, 1901, after a reference to Mrs.\nPiper's sittings, comes what appears to be an attempt to give\nthe name of the mysterious Imperator, but it is too vague for\nidentification. On January llth, 1902, there is perhaps another\nattempt, but again a failure, to identify Imperator in the words :\n\" Imperat Imperator alii non tibi\u2014nee Latine loquitur.\" * On\nDecember 6th, 1904, came a long address to some one, possibly\nintended for Imperator, though his name does not occur.

FORBES.\nThe cross-correspondences between Mrs. Forbes and myself\nare numerous, and, at the risk of wearying the reader, must\nbe related in detail and at length. Most of them are recorded\nin her script -or in mine; but there are some which, though\nnot so recorded, seem so important an element in determining\nthe nature of our interconnexion that they must be here\nincluded. The evidence for the dates of the various incidents\nin these cross-correspondences, though fairly complete, is not\nall equally good. Every note that I have on the subject is\ndated, so that I arn always able to say whether an impression\nof my own was recorded before or after its justification. I\nhave also kept every letter that I have received from Mrs.\nForbes since the beginning of our acquaintance, and she\nhas sent me copies of all writing of hers which concerned or\nseemed to concern me. In some cases we have been able to\nobtain external corroboration ; the dates of Mrs. Forbes' script\nare attested by the postmarks on the envelopes in which\nthey were sent to me; and since November, 1902, the dates\naf my script are attested by the postmarks and Sir Oliver\nLodge's corroboration. It seems most convenient to relate the\nhistory of our cross-correspondences in chronological sequence\nwithout any attempt at classification.\nThe first time that I heard the name of Mrs. Forbes was on\nJune 23rd, 1900, when I received a letter mentioning that she\nhad had a successful sitting with Mrs. Thompson.1 Later that\nMrs. Forbes of this paper is the Mrs. Scott of Mr. Pid-\ndington's article on Types of Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's trance\nin the S.P.R.

[PART\nautumn I heard from a friend of Mrs. Forbes' automatic script,\nand I met her one evening in December, 1900. She then\ntold me under what circumstances her automatic writing\nhad begun, and what evidence she had for its genuine\ncharacter. The supposed writer, in her case, was her only\nson Talbot, who had been killed in the South African War.\nThe next time that I saw Mrs. Forbes was on February 5th,\n1901, when she came to Cambridge to see Miss Johnson\nand me on business connected with the S.P.B.. On that\noccasion I did not see her alone.\nIt will make the incidents in this complicated series\nclearer if I state first, in each case, what occurred, and then\nrelate the necessary facts concerning my knowledge of those\noccurrences. A list of corroborative documents' is given in\nthe Appendix.1 For convenience of reference I have here num\nbered the successive incidents in Roman notation; the Arabic\nnumerals in brackets refer to the numbered list of extracts\nfrom my own script. In this chapter quotations from my script\nare in small type as elsewhere, and messages automatically\nproduced by Mrs. Forbes are in italics. It must be remembered\nthat no selection has been made but that I give all the cases\nin which my script seemed to refer to Mrs. Forbes, not only\nthose which appear to have ' evidential ' value.\n(I.) On Sunday, February 24th, 1901, between 11 and 12\na.m., Mrs. Forbes, at her house in the North of England, was\nengaged with a friend, Mrs. Baltimore, then unknown to me, in\nplanchette-writing. The first words were : \" Edmund Gfurney-2\nwrites for H. \" ; then, after answering intelligently several\nquestions put to it, the instrument wrote : \" let us see our friends\nin Cambridge.

Before beginning to\nread the article he had used the expression to me : \" Make\nyourself comfortable,\" and, after so doing I sat beside him,\nlooking over the MS. as he read it. The description of\nPlanchette seemed to us correct ; my attitude and occupation\nwere suggestive of reading, though I held no book.\nSuch are the facts. My knowledge of them came about as\nfollows : On February 25th late, on returning from town, I\nfound a note from Miss Johnson, enclosing a letter from Mrs.\nForbes, asking what I had been doing from 11 to 12 on the\n24th, and describing the statement of Planchette. I sent our\nrecollections to Miss Johnson on February 25th and to Mrs.\nForbes on February 26th. On March 4th I heard from Mrs.\nForbes the full account of the incident.2\n(II.) March 17th, 1901.\nOn Sunday, March 17th, about 11.45 a.m., while I was\nreading in my husband's study, I felt a sudden impulse to\nwrite automatically. I had never before written except when\nalone and in the dark, and at first resisted the impulse. It\nwas, however, so marked that I wrote, finishing at 11.58 a.m.\nThe script (No. 1) said :\n1 This was not noted at the time, but remembered on the evening\nof February 25th, after enquiry concerning the matter had come\nfrom Mrs. Forbes, and it was confirmed by my husband's recollec\ntion,\n2 There is possibly a connexion between the receipt on March 4th\nof Mrs. Forbes' letter, giving the names of her supposed communi\ncators, and the marked improvement in my automatic script of\nMarch 5th. It is at least certain that her letter was a great\nencouragement to me.\n\f222 Chapter XI.

To\nthis she answered that on Sunday, from about 12 to 1, she\nwas automatically writing a not very successful message. As\nthis appears to be the first introduction into the script of any\nallusion to Mrs. Forbes, it is here related not for its own sake,\nbut to make the series complete.\n(III.)

August 28th, 1901.\nAfter a letter on April 16th from Mrs. Forbes I had no\nfurther communication with her till October ; but in the script\nproduced in the interval there was at least one definite allusion\nto her affairs, unrecognised by me till some time later. On\nAugust 28th, 1901, the script began as follows :\n* Trans. \"What is more difficult, not to say impossible, unless\nyou also wish it? To-day I can, not without doubt.

Mrs. Forbes has in\nher garden four or five small fir-trees grown from seed sent to\nher from abroad by her son ; these are called by her Talbot's\ntrees. This fact was entirely unknown to me. On August 28th\nMrs. Forbes' script contained the statement, purporting to come\nfrom her son, that he was looking for a \"sensitive\" who\nwrote automatically, in order that he might obtain corroboration\nfor her own writing, and it concluded with the remark that\nhe must now leave her in order to join E.G. in controlling\nthe sensitive. The hour of her writing on August 28th does\nnot appear, but as she usually writes early in the day and\nas mine of the same date was at 10.30 p.m., it is probable\nthat hers preceded mine.\nIt thus appears that on a certain day \" Talbot Forbes \" in\nMrs. Forbes' script declared that he was seeking and implied\nthat he had found another automatic writer through whom\nto communicate with her.1 On the same day a statement was\nmade in my script about fir-trees planted in a garden which\n* Trans. \"Sign with the seal.

[PART\nhad a meaning for Mrs. Forbes and a special connexion with\nher automatic experiments, and the signature of this script, to\nwhich attention had been directed, represented partially the\nbadge of Talbot Forbes' regiment, together with a sword.1 As\nbearing on the question whether such a combination is likely\nto have been accidental, I may say that on no other occasion\nhas a bugle appeared in the script, nor has there been any\nother reference to a planted fir-tree.2\nI learned the above facts as follows: On November 13th, 1901,\nMrs. Forbes stayed with me for one night, and I showed\nher some of the English parts of my writing. There were\nsome things in it which suggested to her traces of an influence\nsimilar to her son's, and in discussing these questions she had\noccasion to mention a memorial to him which was surmounted\nby the regimental badge, a suspended bugle below a crown.\nI then remembered that in my script there had been a draw\ning which had puzzled me at the time, of which this badge\nreminded me. Subsequent examination verified the representa\ntion, so far as concerns the bugle. The nail on which the bugle\nis suspended is plainly indicated. It struck me as remarkable\nthat the opening sentence of the script so signed should contain\nan allusion full of meaning for Mrs. Forbes. I asked her to\nlook through her script and let me have a copy of any remarks\nthat might concern me, and in that way became acquainted\nwith the fact that on the same day, August 28th, her script\nas above quoted had suggested connexion with another auto\nmatic writer.3\n(V.) September 20th, 1901.\nThe first actual mention in my script of Mrs. Forbes' name\nis on September 20th, 1901 (No. 3), when it is suggested that\nI should ask her if she has a message for me about \" g i m a \"\n1 No explanation of the open scissors has been suggested.\n2 Except once subsequently, on November 27th, 1901, after veri\nfication of the incident, when it was quoted as an encouragement.\n3 I knew nothing at the time when my script was produced of\nthe surroundings or tastes of Mrs. Forbes.

Nothing has been made of this suggestion.\nIn the afternoon before writing I had seen a letter to a friend\nin which Mrs. Forbes' name occurred frequently. This I noted\nat the time, thinking it a possible explanation of the occurrence\nof her name. She was abroad at the time and not -trying\nfor automatic writing.\n(VI.) November 13th, 1901.\nThe next incident in this story was a meeting between Mrs.\nForbes and myself at my house, where she stayed for one night,\nas related above. Letters from her on 28th and 30th October,\n1901, had seemed to indicate a similarity in the topics\nmentioned in her script and mine about the middle of October.\nBut the topic was one not unlikely to occur to us both. Her\nname did not appear in my writing, but my name did\nappear in hers. When she stayed with me on Nov. 13 we\nobtained some writing with Planchette, but all of a vague\ndescription. My own script, written after the Planchette-\nattempts, encouraged rne to persevere, but was non-evidentiaL\n(VII.) November 22nd, 1901.\nSoon after Mrs. Forbes' visit my script (No. 4), associated\nher name with that of Mrs. Thompson. The association of\nnames was likely enough to occur, for Mrs. Forbes and I,\nhaving both had sittings with Mrs. Thompson, had, on the\noccasion of Mrs. Forbes' visit to me, compared our experiences\nand impressions.\n(VIII.) November 25th, 1901.\nOn November 22nd, 1901, immediately after the above\nreference to Mrs. Forbes, the script produced an attempt to\nrepresent a communication from Mr. F. M. Balfour, Mrs.\nSidgwick's brother. The introduction of this first definite\nattempt at impersonation of some one hardly known to me\ndisturbed me at the time as I was unwilling to show the\nscript or apply to Mrs. Sidgwick for confirmation of statements\nwhich could be fully accounted for as the product of my own\nimagination. On November 25th, after resisting an earlier\n\f226 Chapter XI. [PART\ndesire I wrote at 6.50 p.m., and further matter was produced\noil the same subject.1\nOn November 25th, between 2 and 3 p.m. Mrs. Forbes' script\nproduced first a confused message from \" E.G.\" to me about\nmy writing, followed by a clear message from \" Talbot \" that\nI was to be told at once by that day's post that the friends\nwere with her [Mrs. Verrall] when she was with Mrs. Sidgewick\n[sic]. In the language of Mrs. Forbes' script to be with usually\nmeans to sympathise with or think about, so that the phrase\nwhen she was with Mrs. Sidgwick was a not inappropriate repre\nsentation of my attitude of mind between the 22nd and 25th.\nThe message in Mrs. Forbes' script seemed to me at the time\nto show a knowledge on her part of a feeling of my own\nnormally impossible for her to divine. It preceded my own\nwriting of November 25th, which contained much more definite\nallusions to Mr. Balfour than were in the first attempt on\nNovember 22nd. Whether or not it preceded the impulse to\nwrite on the 25th, I am unable to say ; \" all the afternoon \"\nare the words in my diary, so that it is probable that Mrs.\nForbes' writing closely corresponded with the beginning of\nthe impulse to write which culminated in my writing at\n6.50 p.m.\nIt is interesting to note in Mrs. Forbes' script the confusion\nof the first message to me from \" E.G.\" and the clearness of\nthe message from \" Talbot.\" It has frequently happened that\na long and confused communication from \"E.G.\" or others\nhas been followed by a clear and much shorter message from\n\" Talbot.\"2\n(IX.) December 5th, 1901.\nOn December 5th, 1901 (No. 5), my script introduced the\nname \"Talbot\" for the first time in the words:\nNote the hour, I will tell some one else I was here\u2014talbot\nhelping.\nThe writing was produced between 5.20 and 6.0 p.m.\nOn December 5th, from 12 to 12.30 p.m., Mrs. Forbes was\nwriting automatically what seems to be an attempt to explain\n!See pp. 26, 152. 2See below, pp. 230, 244-5.\n\fLIII.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 227\nthe difficulty of simultaneous writing or connexion between\ntwo automatic writers. The words are: for earth-friend to\nsee with earth-friend the light is feeble. When the friends see\ntogether the same light is the force that we use for this letter.\nThis writing of hers preceded mine, and so if there is any\nconnexion other than accidental between them the tense in\nmine is not appropriate.\nMrs. Forbes and I had agreed to communicate at once with\none another if either of us found allusions to the other in her\nwritings. Although in her script of December 5th there was\nno allusion to me, she sent it at once to me, so that I received\nit on December 6th by the second post. Mrs. Forbes not\ninfrequently acts on some impulse not completely represented in\nher writing ; in fact her interpretation of what she writes\nseems ofteii to go beyond what is stated in the actual words.\nThis is perhaps natural, as she is largely conscious of what she\nproduces, more so, I think, than is the case with me. Thus,\nthough there was no mention of my name in her script, she\nsupposed it to concern me, and acted on her impression.\n(X.) December 16th, 1901.\nOn December 10th, 1901, Sir Oliver Lodge suggested to\nme that I should try the experiment of writing every day\nat a fixed hour. I accordingly wrote to Mrs. Forbes, whose\nautomatic writing had previously made to her a similar sugges\ntion, to tell her that I proposed to do this, and that henceforth\nwe should try for coincidence not of date but of subject. I\nwrote automatically on December 10th, llth, 12th, and 13th, on\nthe last occasion at a friend's house. But on the 14th I found\nit impossible to get any time to myself, and the same thing\nhappened again on the 15th. I was very much annoyed at\nhaving to break what I regarded as a compact, and throughout\nthese two days my thoughts were constantly occupied with\nthe failure on my part. I decided to abandon any attempt to\nwrite during my absence from home, and on December 16th I\nwrote to that effect to Mrs. Forbes.\nOn December 16th Mrs. Forbes obtained a message for me\nwhich she sent on at once, though owing to my absence from\nhome, of which I had not told her, I did not receive it till\n\f228 Chapter XL [PART\nDec. 18th. The note enclosing it said: \"It seems to me rather\nfussy\u2014as if it were to be sent at once, but it also looks as if\nyou were to make time somehow to try for some writing\nyourself.\" She added her impression that there was some\nmistake about this, as she knew that I was making time\nevery day. The script enclosed said : Mrs. Verrall to try to\nsee for ! H. H. says\u2014to say friends -Can wait is far from\ncourteous ; then further broken remarks : would it seem fair\nfor the spirits to sit for work for hours . . . she sat with\nfoolish . . . 2 and so on, with other remarks about the im\nportance of regular attention on the part of automatic writers\nif any results were to be obtained.\nIt thus appears that on the same day on which I wrote\nto Mrs. Forbes to express my regret at my failure to write\nas arranged during the two preceding days, her automatic\nscript produced a reproach to me for, having failed to keep\nmy appointment. The reproach was unintelligible to Mrs.\nForbes, who believed me to be writing regularly. To me the\nmessage seemed appropriate enough ; the opening words are\nnot uncharacteristic of the supposed communicator, and the\nlater remark, she sat with foolish, very closely represented iny\nown feeling of annoyance that I had been occupied in irrelevant\nconversation with persons not interested in our experiment,\nwhen I ought to have been writing.\n(XI.)

January 10th, 1902.\nAfter a letter from Mrs. Forbes written on December 19th, I\nheard nothing further for some weeks, nor was there any\nreference to her in my script. On January llth, 1902, at 9.45\na.m., I noted in my diary that I had felt on the day\nbefore that \" after an interval I had again come into touch \"\nwith whatever it was that produced my automatic script.\nThe impression was especially vivid at 7.0 p.m. and again at\n11.30-12 p.m., on January 10th.\nOn January 10th, at an hour not mentioned, but after 1 p.m.,\nMrs. Forbes automatically wrote a long message for me from\n\" Edmund,\" which I received by the second post of January\nllth, after I had made the above-mentioned entry in my\ndiary. Neither the subjective impression nor the contents of\nthe script are definite enough to be evidential. But the\ncoincidence between the reference to me after three weeks'\nsilence and my own sensation of having \" come into touch \"\nis worth noting, especially as the record of my own feeling\nwas made before I heard from Mrs. Forbes.\n1 See p. 206. This seems to be a reminiscence of an earlier \"cross-\ncorrespondence.\"\n\f230 Chapter XI. [PART\n(XIV.)

When I received from\nher, as I did on March 26th, the automatic message which\nhad induced her to write, I found that it did purport to\nrepresent what the single word had suggested to me. In\nMrs. Forbes' automatic writing, there first appeared the name\nof the 'control' with whom the word was associated in my\nmind and then the single word without context, and without\nmy name. Immediately following it, however, was a much\nclearer message from Talbot, distinctly stating that the control\nnamed wanted you to try for a test with our friend at\nCambridge. Write to Mrs. Verrall to-day. One word will be\nenough. Then in large letters the word in question was written.\nThe significance of the word for me could not have been\nknown to Mrs. Forbes, and accordingly the incident made a\ngreat impression on me.\n(XVII.)

But an incident on April loth,\nwhen she and I wrote together with Plauchette, led to her\nproducing a letter which enabled me to verify a peculiar form\nof Mr. Gurney's signature that had occurred in my script of\nnine months before,2 so that there certainly was something for\nme in Mrs. Forbes' house\u2014something which I should probably\nnot have seen had I not visited her.\n(XIX.)

The likeness in Walterer to Baltimore made me feel\nalmost sure that from the first I had unconsciously guessed at\nMary Baltimore, but in the Planchette-writing was unable\nto prevail over my daughter's ignorance of the name, which\ntherefore only emerged in my own script.

July 13th, 1902.\nOn June IGth my husband and I went to Switzerland for\nsome weeks, and I had no allusions to Mrs. Forbes in my script\ntill July 13th, 1902 (No. 12).2 Then the script written at 9.15\np.m. in the hotel at the top of the Simplon Pass, after a few\nwords of somewhat enigmatic Greek, began a new paragraph :\nOn such an eve of storm the message came across the water far\naway\u2014she will not write nor\n1 See below, No. XXX., p. 241.\n2 I obtained seven pieces of automatic script between my seeing\nMrs. Forbes and this first allusion to her on July 13th.\n\f234 Chapter XI.

Do the signature better H.\nOn July llth, as subsequently appeared, Mrs. Forbes had a\nreference\u2014the first since our meeting\u2014in her script to me. It\nwas not very definite, but suggested that a test was to be\nattempted with the hand of friends; a test will be given\nthrough the friends . . . Here followed an attempt at my name,\nwhich is what induced Mrs. Forbes to send the message to me.\nIt further appeared that Mrs. Forbes had been watching\nand watering with much interest some lilies which had\nlately bloomed, and which were in full flower about July\nllth. Earlier in the summer some red lilies had bloomed, of\nwhich the bulbs had been sent to her by her son. There had\nbeen a good deal of rain in England in early July, and more\nthan one thunderstorm, but the exact dates of the storms were\nnot known. In a letter of July llth she writes that she hopes\nthere has been better weather in Switzerland than in England,\nand that my husband and I have not been \"rained upon as\nwe have been this week.\"\nI have separated the facts as far as possible from our com\nmunications concerning them, but the interchange of letters is\nan important part of this incident. On July 14-th I wrote to\nMrs. Forbes quoting the words of my script of July 13th from\n\"the words are for you\" to the signature \"Talbot,\" and telling\nher that a future date (which I did not give) 2 had been\nmentioned for me to write on. This I posted by the early\n(mid-day) post on July 14th, and by the same post I sent a\n1 The word is indistinctly written.\n2 The whole correspondence between Mrs. Forbes and me in relation\nto this incident was seen by Mr. Piddington in August, 1902.\n\fLin.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 235\nletter to Mr. Piddington containing a copy of the whole script,\nas I thought the message might be evidential.

The message may be going to come on 21st1 or 23rd\nof this month.\"\nBy the evening delivery, 6 p.m., on the same day, July 14th,\nI received from Mrs. Forbes a letter forwarded from Cambridge,\nand written b}' her on July llth, telling me that she had had\na message (automatic) that day, but would not send it, as she\nwanted to know first if I had obtained anything similar. Ity the\nsame evening post of July 14th I sent a card to Mr. Piddiugton\ntelling him of the crossing of letters of enquiry about script\nfrom Mrs. Forbes and myself, the first letters that had passed\nsince our meeting on June 9th. On July 17th Mrs. Forbes\nwrote in answer to my enquiries about the lilies, etc., and this\nletter, enclosing her script of llth, I received on July 19th.\nIt will thus be seen that the statement in my script of\nJuly 13th that a message meant for me had gone to Mrs.\nForbes was true in the sense that on July llth she had\nreceived a message which she took to be connected with me,\nand of which she at once wrote to inform me. There seems\nto have been some truth, though also some confusion, in the\nwould-be evidential allusions in my script; there had been a\nweek of storms in England, some lilies blooming in her garden\nhad been specially watched by Mrs. Forbes, and there were in\nher garden flowers which she could recognise as \" Talbot's lilies.\"\n(XXVI.) July 23rd, 1902.\nThe incident did not end here. Two dates had been men\ntioned on which I was to write, and I wrote on both. On\nJuly 21st nothing was obtained which could possibly be\nconnected with Mrs Forbes. On July 23rd at 12.10 p.m. (No.\n12A), at Ouchy on the Lake of Geneva the script began :\nDouble discharge\u2014but do not ask.\nThen, after reference in Latin to quite a different subject :\nHodie mane aliquid in Britanniarum pusilla insula evenit quod\n1 \"Count three and five\" = 8, and this, added to the date of writing\nthe script (13th) gives 21st as a possible date.\n\f236 Chapter XI.\namicis tuis magnum refert.

H.*\nNaturally, under the circumstances, I connected the reference\nto my friends in England with Mrs. Forbes.\nOn July 23rd Mrs. Forbes wrote to me (enclosing automatic\nwriting) as follows : \" Last night in bed I felt a strong impulse\nto write, this morning when I awoke I felt it again, and now,\nat 10 a.m., I have again felt it. I send you the result. I feel\nmore sure than I have ever felt that whatever mess I may\nhave made of it, there was a genuine effort on 'the other\nside,' and I can't help hoping you have also had some experience.\"\nThe enclosed automatic writing was as follows:\n(a) On July 22nd, 11.30 p.m., from Talbot to say that she\nwas to see with1 Mrs. Verrall's letter,2 and that if possible he\nwould be with her to write automatically the next day.\n(6) July 23rd, at 7.45 a.m., from Talbot to tell her to wait\ntill she was downstairs.\n(c) July 23rd, at 10.0 a.m., from Talbot, Will you see for\nH. for writing to prove identity ? . . . Will you write\nto Mrs. Verrall? And iigain, he only wants to write\u2014you to\nwrite for him to Mrs. Verrall.\"\nIt will be seen that, though two dates were suggested in\nmy script of July 13th, and though I wrote automatically on\nboth of them, on the 21st there was nothing referring to Mrs.\nForbes. On the 23rd I wrote at 12.10 p.m. that on that\nmorning in England something had occurred which much\ninterested my friends, that the day had been announced to me\nbeforehand but not the details, and that the event was not of\npublic but of private interest.

The \" double discharge \" of my script of July 23rd may\neasily be interpreted as referring to the coincidence of our both\nwriting on the same day,2 and in that case it may be regarded\nas suggesting the nature of the event in England.3\nTo sum up the last two incidents, which make part of a\nsingle episode : in the course of some six weeks, during which\nI obtained eleven separate pieces of script, there were two only\nwhich could refer to Mrs. Forbes. On both these occasions\nthe statements of the script were correct. In the same period,\nduring which Mrs. Forbes was constantly writing automatically,\nshe twice, and twice only,4 spontaneously communicated to\nme, as above described, messages automatically obtained, and\nthese corresponded with my writing about her. To make clear\nthe sequence of dates, I have drawn up a statement in\nparallel columns.\nSTATEMENT IN PARALLEL COLUMNS.\nMrs. F., England.\nJuly 11. \" message about Mrs. V.\"\nJuly 23. \"message to Mrs. V.\"\nMrs. V., Switzerland.\nJuly 13. \" message for you went to Mrs. F.\"\nJuly 21. no reference in sc. to Mrs. F.\nJuly 23. \"double discharge.\"\n1 This allows for the difference between English and Middle-Euro\npean time.\n2 As I had told Mrs. Forbes on the 13th that I was to write again\non a future day and hoped that she would do the same, it may be\nsupposed that I expected her to write on the 21st or the 23rd. But\nthough I had script on both days, it was only on the day on which\nshe also wrote that I had any reference applicable to her.\n3 It is to be noticed that Mrs. Forbes' name does not appear in\nthe script. For similar omissions see No. LXII. and also p. 334.\n4 I have counted Mrs. Forbes' script of 11.30 p.m. on July 22nd\nas part of the communication of July 23rd. It was so regarded\nby her and reached me at the same time.\n\f238 Chapter XI. [PART\n(XXVII.) October 27th, 1902.\nNo further reference to Mrs. Forbes occurs in the script\ntill October 27th, 1902 (No. 13), when, after a remark in\nGreek that I too was to write my share and some one else\nwould read,1 came the words:\nit is not wholly right.

It is\nimportant.\nAfter another paragraph on a different subject came a third\nparagraph :\nWrite more often.

Mrs. Forbes had had no writing referring to me since\nJuly 26th when her script referred to the success previously\nnarrated.\nThe second statement, however, on October 27th, \"Talbot\nwill help\u2014all through November,\" seems evidential. On\nOctober 30th, 1902, Mrs. Forbes' script said: We [i.e. \" H.\nwith Talbot\"] will send more work to you when we have\nbeen with Mrs. Verrall, and again : We are going to Cam\nbridge.\nThe first part of this message was sent to me by Mrs.\nForbes on October 30th, 11 a.m., when she did not know that\nthere had been any reference to her in my script of October\n27th. The second sentence from her script, \" We are going to\nCambridge,\" reached me in a letter of November 17th, with\na note that it had been omitted before ; it had been written\nautomatically just after her letter to me of October 30th.\nThus a similar statement appears independently in her script\nand in mine ; mine on October 27th states that Talbot will\nhelp me all through November, and hers on October 30th\nstates that Talbot is going to Cambridge to be with me.\nKal <TV\u2014aAAos\n\fLIU.] Gross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 239\n(XXVIII.) November 2nd, 1902.\nThe next episode is unfortunately spoiled for evidential\npurposes by my having made no note of my part in the affair\ntill after hearing from Mrs. Forbes. The reader must judge\nwhat value to attach to my recollection after the event.\nOn October 27th, 1902, I decided to try an experiment\nwith my automatic writing. At a meeting of the S.P.R. on\nOctober 17th, when I read a paper on my automatic\nscript, several speakers urged me to \" talk to rny control.\"\nThis I felt to be impossible, as I have no sense of the\npresence of a \" control,\" and to address my hand would be\nabsurd. But I was struck with the general agreement of\nautomatic writers as to the importance of this point, and I\ndecided to try the following experiment. On October 27th,\n1902, and again on October 31st, before writing, I sat for some\nfifteen minutes in the dark, concentrating my thoughts on one\nof the supposed communicators, H. Being a strong visualiser\nI soon began, as always when recalling any one, to picture him\nto myself; I imagined him sitting on the corner of the seat in\nthe drawing-room, where he always sat when he called. There\nwas a moment on the 27th when I had so clear a mental image\nof him that I found myself looking towards the seat as if\nhe were actually sitting there, and I distinctly remember\nrealising how vivid my power of visualisation is. On\nthe 31st I thought of him from the beginning as sitting\non that seat. I made 110 note of this experiment at the time.\nI have no habit of recording impressions, and I was writing\nas little as possible in my diary at the time, because I was\nunable to use my right hand, and left-hand writing I then\nfound extremely laborious.\nOn November 2nd Mrs. Forbes wrote to me, enclosing a\npassage in her script of the same day. After a message from\nTalbot to say that H. had a message for me, that Mrs.\nForbes was to come with him to Cambridge, and that the diffi\nculty of definite statement was very great, there was an\ninterval of ten minutes in which she had no writing ; then\ncame the following : H. sees the words\u2014not so strong as\nyour son's writing, but clearer.

I\nrelated it to Mr. Piddington on November 3rd, and sent him\nMrs. Forbes' letters of October 30th and November 2nd, as\nwell as copies of my own script. I did not tell Mrs. Forbes\nmore than that her message was intelligible and interesting,\ntill December 12th or 13th, when I sent her the written\naccount. In writing back to me on December 18th she\nemphasised the vividness of her impression, saying : \" My\nmessage [i.e. the message to me about H.'s presence on\nthe old seat] . . . was told me\u2014as I might tell you\u2014I had\nbeen with a mutual friend sitting in a certain place.\" When\nI wrote to Mrs. Forbes on November 4th I asked her to send\nto me at once any references she obtained in her script, and\nto allow me to leave her entirely uninformed as to their\nintelligibility or appropriateness. This she most kindly con\nsented to do in a letter written on November 5th.\n(XXIX.)

November llth, 1902.\nOn November 7th, 1902, Mrs. Forbes sent me a long and\nobscure piece of script about working with wood of cedar and\nX-rays, which operate through wood. I could make nothing\nof it,2 but it doubtless suggested the next reference to Mrs.\nForbes in my own script of November llth, 1902 (No. 15):\nMrs. Forbes writes of the cedar-wood\u2014You cannot find that\u2014\nask about the chest\u2014with the faint smell\u2014upstairs\u2014in a room\u2014\nwith a window on a garden all a maze\u2014ask someone this.\nThe chest reminded me of the earlier allusion (No. XXII.)\nto a dark wood drawer, but neither message had any meaning\nfor Mrs. Forbes, as she told me later.\n(XXXI.) November 26th and 27th, 1902.\nA short message from Mrs. Forbes on November 14th, to\nsay that a test was being prepared in connexion with me,\nwas followed by two messages written on successive days and\nreceived by me together.\nOn November 26th Mrs. Forbes wrote : H. opens a book\nlong closed ; and on November 27th she wrote : Will\nit be worth while to try to follow the clue of yesterday ?\nH. wishes Mrs. Verrall to open the last book she read for\nhim in which is the true word of the test. If she will try\nto begin the sentence with this word he will be sure to prove\nhis being the writer\u2014let the letter be sent to-night. She added\nthat there was also an effort to write a word which seemed\nto begin ESO.\nI was completely puzzled by this message, which I received\nby the first post of November 28th, 1902. It was so clearly\nexpressed and definite that I was disposed to attach great\nvalue to it, but I could not understand what I was meant\niSee below, No. XXXI.\n2 It is suggested that the meaning might be that I was to be\ncontent with my ordinary habit of automatic writing, and not try\ntalking to the control.\nQ\n\f242 Chapter XL [PART\nto do. I could attach no meaning to the phrase \" the last\nbook read for H.,\" nor could I see how even if I could think\nof such a book I was to know in which part of it was to be\nfound the word with which I was to begin a sentence. I\nnoted my bewilderment at 10 a.m. on November 28th, and\npuzzled over the question all day. In the evening I thought\nof a possibility. During the two days, November 26th and\n27th, my thoughts had been much occupied with Plato's\nDialogue of the Symposium. A passage from it (202s\u2014203A)\nhad been set for translation for November 21st, 1902, by a\nlecturer of Trinity College, Cambridge,1 and I am in the habit\nof using the Trinity College translation papers for my class at\nNewnham College. My own lecture on the subject was to be\non Saturday, November 29th. On November 26th I read in\nthe Dialogue the context of the passage selected, and on\nNovember 27th I looked over some ten or twelve translations\nof the passage. During those two days my mind was full of\nthe passage, of the reference to it earlier in my script, and\nof the appropriateness of its selection. If the book intended\nwas the Symposium, the word intended might very well be\none of the phrases in the selected extract about the inter\nmediation of spirits between God and man. On the chance\nthat the Symposium might be the book I was to open, I\ndecided to fix my mind upon it before trying for automatic\nscript that evening. This I noted at the time.\nWhen once my attention had been drawn to the Sym\nposium I saw reasons for its suitability to the conditions\ndemanded by Mrs. Forbes' script, though I had not punctuated\nher message 2 so as to refer it to the last book read by me.\nMrs. Forbes' script however contained the word \"clue,\" which\nwas the word used in my own early reference to the Sym-\n1 See App., p. 414, for the passage.\n2 I read the words in Mrs. Forbes' script as the last book she read\nfor him, and it was not till Mr. Piddington took them otherwise\nthat I saw that they need not have this meaning. The simplest\ninterpretation certainly is, that I was to open for H. the last book\nI had read. The last book read by me before November 28th\nwas Plato's Symposium. I read no other book on November 26th\nor 27th, having visitors in the house and my translation papers to\nlook over.\n\fLIU.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 243\nposium, May 31st, 1901. My own script also of November\n26th, written, in spite of great difficulties, in obedience\nto a strong impulse, and unfortunately interrupted, had con\ntained in Greek1 a suggestion that there was something\nwhich I could not accomplish alone. I was therefore dis\nposed to attach special value to Mrs. Forbes' script and\nanxious to carry out its instructions. On the chance then\nthat I might be doing so, I fixed my mind before writing\non the passage in question and made the following notes before\nand after obtaining my script2:\n\"Nov. 28th, 1902, 5.40 p.m. [i.e before writing.] My mind\nfixed on Diotima and her clue, that the Sai\/moviov yeVo?\ncrvfiTr\\tjpol between God and man and that of these [i.e. of\nthe race of intermediary spirits] one is Eros.\"\n\" Nov. 28th. 6.45 p.m. [i.e. after writing] I tried the experi\nment above recorded before writing, as I thought that Mrs.\nForbes' message [i.e. of Nov. 26th, 27th] might be an attempt\nto represent my interest in the Symposium passage which\nhad been set and which I had been reading and correcting\non 26th and 27th.\"\nI made this experiment3 in the hopes that if the Sym\nposium were the book intended by Mrs. Forbes' script, she\nwould get a clearer reference to it at her next attempt.\nNaturally, I said nothing of this to her.\n(XXXII.)

From this time onwards all my writing\nwas sent to Sir Oliver Lodge as it was obtained, so that there is\nexternal evidence for the dates of each piece of script.\n\f244 Chapter XI. [PART\nThis was her next attempt, and it seemed to me an unmis-\ntakeable reference to the Dialogue such as I had hoped to obtain.\nHer writing was as follows (for purposes of reference I have\ndivided it into the three parts of which it obviously consists,\naccording to the supposed communicators, i.e. H., E.G., and\nTalbot) :\n(a) ... word . . .

Talbot writes to say you can be sure . . . it is\none of the most Hymeneal Songs\u2014Love's oldest melody.\nIt appears to me indisputable that there is here an attempt\nto refer to the passage in the Symposium which I had fixed\nupon and noted before writing automatically on November\n28th. The first part of the message purporting to come from\nH. tries to give a \"word,\" and the attempt represents\nthe initial capital and the two following letters of the name\nDiotima\u2014a name, I need hardly say, entirely unknown\nto Mrs. Forbes.3 In the second message, attributed to Mr.\nGurney, is a further attempt at the word which is described\nas the \" word of the test,\" and which is to be sent to me ;\nit is also added that this word will be found in Mr. Myers'\nown\u2014something not named. Finally \" Talbot \" communicates\na description, not inappropriate, of the Dialogue, in language\n1 Mrs. Forbes marks ' Dionysus ' as a guess.\n2 Or sit; word not clear.\n3 Mrs. Forbes is unacquainted with Latin and Greek and has\nread no translation of the Platonic dialogue in which the name\nDiotima occurs, nor any commentary on Greek philosophy or literature.\nMr. Myers' book on Human Personality, contained (Vol. I. p. 113)\na reference to this passage of the Symposium and mentioned specifically\nthe name of Diotima, but the book was not published till February,\n1903, and Mrs. Forbes had not seen any of the proof-sheets. No other\nclassical name or allusion has, as far as I am aware, occurred in\nMrs. Forbes' script, certainly not in any script of hers seen by me.\n\fLIII.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 245\nnot natural to my own phraseology nor, I should think, to\nthat of Mrs. Forbes; she in fact completely misunderstood the\nallusion, for in the letter enclosing her script she wrote: \"if\nit turns out that you- have anything to do with weddings\nto-morrow, or are reading any special book with a Hymeneal\nsong in it, I shall be very much delighted.\"\nNot the least interesting point in this script is the drama\ntisation. The first communicator, with great difficulty,\nproduces only an attempt at a word. The second describes\nthat word as part of a test, says that it concerns me and\nattempts to add a further point for its identification. The\nthird, in a few words written with comparative ease, gives\na description of the book such as suits very well the supposed\nsituation, viz., that of an intermediary not himself acquainted\nwith the passage in question but endeavouring to help in the\ntransmission under difficulties of a somewhat technical allusion.\nMy own script of December 19th\u2014the Friday suggested for\nwriting by Mrs. Forbes\u2014contained some fresh points about\nthe Symposium, passage1 but no direct reference to Mrs.\nForbes. Before writing on Dec. 19th I had turned my thoughts,\nas noted at the time, to Diotima and the Symposium, hoping\nthat Mrs. Forbes would get the words Plato or Eros to com\nplete the proof.\n(XXXIII.)

This is the most convenient place to describe those\nattempts.\nOn January 6th, 1903, her script had combinations of\nletters suggestive of the Greek name \" sumposion \" ; thus :\n\"... son . . . son suspuro suspiro sryseo sym on H. eros.\"\nFaint scribbles contain a possible suggestion of Greek letters,\nbut there is no identifiable Greek character.\nOn January llth unmistakeable isolated Greek1 characters\nwere produced : \u00ab, e, p, cr, <\/>, ?, a ; and described as part of\nan uncompleted test.\nOn February 20th there appeared all we write is really\nSYMP (here the line ended and the next began)\u2014a the tic (?)2\nThis suggests that what Mrs. Forbes calls a guess had com\npleted the word. The first four letters Symp are larger and\nseparated from the following three groups of letters.\nOn March 2nd her script had : Write to Mrs. Verrall to say\nthe word we want to send her to-day is sympathy come y,\nand in the same script was a scrawl which Mr. Piddington, to\nwhom I sent it, interpreted as an attempt to produce \"E\/wo?\nlove,\" and a second scrawl which he read as \" o e r o ? \" [sic].\nOn April 1st, after something about a seal in a drawer,\nwith written words, came \" s y m p athy,\" again suggesting\nthat to symp had been added an obvious termination. The\nlike came again in the same script: \"Seal s ym p athy write\nthis.\" Here followed an archaic Greek capital S\u2014 the initial\nletter of the dialogue.3\n1 Mrs. Forbes does not know the Greek alphabet and has never\nconsciously written Greek characters.\n2 The question-mark was written by Mrs. Forbes in her script as\nsent to me.\n3 Mrs. Forbes attached so little meaning to this sign that she omitted\nit in the copy sent me, though it is plain in the original.\n\fLIU.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 247\n(XXXV.) January 3rd and 4th, 1903.\nThe next incident concerns a communication obtained\nthrough Planchette by Mrs. Forbes and Mrs. Baltimore.\nOn January 3rd they obtained : Short are the words to the\nwriter but long to the reader\u2014write this with date and hour\nto Mrs. Verrall.\nOn January 4th they obtained another message to me, con\nfused, but indicating that I was to look in my own room\nfor a lost something hid in some article of furniture.\nThe only fact with which we could in any way connect this\nwas the loss of a note of my husband's referring to his thought-\ntransference experiment.1 The loss had been finally announced\nby him to me on January 4th. But it seems very doubtful\nwhether this is within the meaning of the Planchette message.\nA further reference to this incident possibly appears in my\nscript of January 21st (see below, No. XXXIX.).\n(XXXVI.) January 6th, 1903.\nMrs. Forbes' script of this date contained attempts (see above)\nat the word Symposium. It was not posted, but given to me\nby her when we met in London on January 7th. On January\n9th I met Mrs. Baltimore for the first time at Mrs Forbes'\ninvitation.\n(XXXVII.) January 14th, 1903.\nOn January 14th (No. 17) my own script, written in Lon\ndon, when I had been there nearly a month, and was about to\nleave, said :\nMrs. Forbes has sent it to you\u2014or should have by now; she\nhas got nearer and will get the word. Write more often this month\n\u2014we can do more now for you. Your husband's test goes forward,\nMrs. Forbes gets that better than you do\u2014write regularly\u2014there\nwill be news for you to write next week\u2014good news before the\nmonth is out.\nThe last sentences are too vague to be valuable. The first\nremark seemed to me at the time incorrect. I had received\nnothing from Mrs. Forbes since our meeting in London, and\nfound nothing from her when I reached home on January\n1See above, p. 157.\n\f248 Chapter XI. [PART\n16th. But I subsequently ascertained that she had had a\nmessage for me on January llth, containing unmistakeable\nGreek characters,1 so that she might be said to have \" got\nnearer to the word I wanted.\" Contrary to her custom, she\nhad not sent me the script at once. Nor did she send me\na fragmentary message about opening a book which she\nobtained on January 13th. On January 14th, at 5.30 p.m.,\nshe was reminded by her script of these omissions : H. wants\nyou to write to friends. This reminder in her script preceded\nby one hour and a half the statement in my script that a\nmore successful attempt had been made by her, and had been,\nor should have been, sent to me. As a matter of fact, it was\nonly on January 20th that Mrs. Forbes sent me her scripts of\nJanuary llth, 13th, and 14th together with another, and owing\nto my having left London, they did not reach me till the\nevening of January 23rd.\n(XXXVIII.) January 18th, 1903.\nOn Sunday, January 18th, 1903, before writing, I made an\nexperiment of the same type as those of October 27th and\n31st, 1902.2 I fixed my attention on talks with H. on certain\ndays in 1900, and noted this before obtaining script.\nOn January 20th Mrs. Forbes, who knew nothing of this,\nwrote automatically that there had been some connexion\nbetween H. and me on Sunday during a sitting : H. writes to\nsay Verrall . . . Verrall saw with H. on Sunday. And\nagain : Mrs. Verrall was with H. on Sunday when he (or\nshe) sat with Mr. . . . This letter I received as above\ndescribed on January 23rd. It is interesting to find the\nexperiment made by me before writing on January 18th again\nreflected in Mrs. Forbes' script a few days later. This time\nthe evidence is complete, as my script with the note upon\nit was out of my hands before I received her letter.\n(XXXIX.) January 21st, 1903.\nOn January 21st, 1903 (No. 18), my script, after a refer\nence to the Symposium, went on:\nWait for the word from Mrs. Forbes. The paper is hid in your\nhouse and should be found.

It obviously refers to my\nhusband's lost note. The description of the paper (according\nto his recollection) is right but not distinctive.\n(XL.) January 25th, 1903.\nOn January 25th, 1903, Mrs. Forbes and I sat simultaneously\nto try for automatic writing in accordance with a suggestion\nof her script on January 22nd. My writing contained no\nreference to her. Her writing contained an attempt to give\nverifiable matter concerning my husband, as follows : \" But\nyou can tell her that H. sat with her\u2014when she sat still\nin the . . . Mr. Verrall's room\u2014with . . . on her . . . Mr.\nVerrall Dr. Verrall was with own work\u2014say luork work of\n. . . Let us see first the Cambridge writer\u2014on the chair lies\nthe Paper\u2014the work is done . . . no word H. will ever\nsee ... it is too far for you to travel.\"\nMy husband finished a particular bit of work (a paper on a\nclassical subject) on the afternoon of this day, and put it\nwhen finished on a chair beside him. The words, \" Let us see\n. . . work is done,\" may refer to this. Mrs. Forbes' script\nwas written at 6.30 p.m.\n(XLI.) February 2nd, 1903.\nOn February 2nd, 1903, Mrs. Forbes and I again sat simul\ntaneously by arrangement. This time her writing contained\nnothing evidential, but my script (No. 19) seems to have\nproduced something intelligible to her. After curious Latin\nallusions to the Feast of the Purification, confused, as I have\ndescribed,1 with a Nativity, and a remark about a friend whom\nI was to meet the next day, it wrote :\nHarriet de Vane with another.\nThe name Harriet was in a hand resembling that of Mrs.\nForbes, and the words quoted were followed by nonsense words\n!See p. 121.\n\f250 Chapter XL [PART\nin a hand distinctly resembling the less legible parts of her writ\ning. I took the name Harriet de Vane as intended for sending\nto Mrs. Forbes, and sent it accordingly. I then heard from\nher that she has a pastel drawing of her great-grandmother\nby Harriet de Vim. The drawing is in the room where she\nwas writing automatically on February 2nd. I had been in\nthe room and must have seen the portrait, but on a subsequent\nvisit I ascertained that the name of the artist is not visible.\nMrs. Forbes also told me that her husband's birthday is Feb\nruary 2nd, so that if any connexion is admitted between her\nscript and mine, it is conceivable that her thought of Feb\nruary 2nd as a birthday may have contributed to the intro\nduction into my script of incidents more appropriate to a\nNativity than to a Purification.\n(XLII.) February 22nd and 23rd, 1903.\nOn these days by arrangement I sat for automatic writing\nsimultaneously with Mrs. Forbes and Mrs. Baltimore. On Feb\nruary 22nd nothing evidential occurred.\nOn February 23rd the experiment seems to have been more\nsuccessful. My own script dated 6.15 p.m. (No. 20) said:\nMrs. Forbes has got a message but not about the word,1 you must\nwait for that.\nAfter a few more vague encouragements in Latin there is a\nblank in the script and I am aware that at some point\nduring the writing, probably at this point, I went to sleep.\nI was roused by the slamming of a door and wrote rapidly\non waking. The next words after the gap were :\nIt has helped them and you will get a message now plain to\nread. Send this to her.\nI noted that my writing was over at 6.30. I have no doubt\nthat the momentary sleep came immediately before the remark\nthat it had helped, and I took the \" it \" to refer to this sleep.2\nAt 6 p.m. Mrs. Forbes and Mrs. Baltimore began their\n1 Obviously the test word which Mrs. Forbes knew me to be\nexpecting. See Nos. XXXI., XXXII.\n2 The incident of my sleepiness was noted on the original document\nas soon as the automatic writing was completed.\n\fLIIL] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 251\nexperiment and at Planchette's suggestion used a glass and\nletters, so that their words were not written but spelt out:\nTell Mrs. Verrall to take care\u2014to go\u2014Hove when she\nis visiting Brighton ALFRED. At this point they resumed\nPlanchette, which wrote : Tell Mrs. Verrall H. sees with\na trouble of which he cannot speak\u2014you will know\u2014when\nhe writes\u2014Hove.\nThis message was only too appropriate. For some days my\nmind had been much occupied with a trouble connected with\nthe illness of the daughter of a friend of mine, Alfred, who\nwas living at Hove, near Brighton. On February 16th or\n17th I had received from his wife a letter which had dis\ntressed me. I answered this on February 17th; on February\n18th I saw in London some members of his family; on\nFebruary 19th I received another seriously disturbing letter\nand discussed its contents with my husband on that evening,\nand the next morning, on February 20th, I wrote to Alfred's\nwife saying that I hoped no decision would have to be\narrived at before we went to Brighton at Easter. This subject\nthen had been occupying me greatly for some days and the\nform that my thoughts constantly took was regret for the\ntrouble of Alfred and his wife.\nThe suggestion that I should go to Hove when visiting\nBrighton and the connexion of this suggestion with the word\n\"trouble\" and the name Alfred closely corresponded with\nfeelings of mine which it seemed impossible for the writers\nto know. I enquired of them whether the combination of\nnames (i.e. Hove, Brighton, Alfred) suggested to them any\nassociations and if so, what? Mrs. Forbes wrote that they\nhad none for her; that she hardly knew Brighton and had\nno friends living there. Mrs. Baltimore replied that she had no\nassociations except that she knew Hove to be near Brighton.\nAlfred knew nothing of either lady. It seems therefore clear\nthat the Planchette writers had no knowledge which could\nhave led to the production of the message sent to me. It\nseems equally clear that my script was correct in stating that\nMrs. Forbes had a message, not about my test, and that\nit would be plain to read. It is probable that at least part\nof their writing must have been subsequent to mine.\n\f252 Chapter XI. [PART\nThe process of spelling words is very slow and as they had\nhad some writing with Planchette before the spelling process\nbegan it is unlikely that their sitting should have been over\nat 6.30, when my own was completed.\n(XLIII.) March llth and 15th, 1903.\nOn March llth, 1903, my script wrote as follows (No. 21):\nKal SfKaTQ \u2022f^f\/Lfp^ cas avT'as yap Kal <TV Kal aAAos \u00abi?\ne\\Ooire av. o\/j.fjia.Ti \\pfjv6ai * on that day watch, not alone,\nwhen the vision comes note the day and count from now.\nMrs. Forbes has got the other word and will send it\u2014not Sym\nposium but it helps and is clear. I don't think she knows it is\nfor you but you will understand.\nThe first paragraph is obscure and was quite unintelligible\nat the time. The second paragraph states plainly that Mrs.\nForbes has got another word for me not the word of the\nSymposium. On March 15\u2014possibly in consequence of the\nnumerical suggestion in the opening words of the above script\u2014\nmy script recurred to the topic and after attempts at a word\nand a reference to Dr. Hodgson, wrote :\nMrs. Forbes is slow but she has something which you have not\nseen,\nand finally told me to \" Ask Mrs. Forbes for hers.\"\nAs I have said above,1 on March 10 one of Mrs. Piper's trance-\npersonalities made attempts\u2014obviously incomplete\u2014to give a\npassword for reproduction by other automatists. So that the\nsuggestion in the words of the first paragraph on March 11\n(\" You and another,\" \" not alone,\") of an attempt at a cross-\ncorrespondence is not inappropriate if applied to me and Mrs.\nPiper's trance-personality. But the statement in the second\nparagraph of March 11 about Mrs. Forbes is incorrect. Early\nin March Mrs. Forbes had been called away by sudden illness\nand had had no time for automatic writing.\n* Trans. \" On the fifteenth day (reading ire\/iuTTy for jre\/wrrij), for\nin the same way will both you and another come to understanding.\nUse sight.\"\n1 See p. 217.

April 2nd, 1903.\nOn April 2nd, 1903, in the train between London and\nBrighton my script wrote (No. 23) :\nMrs. Forbes has gone home ask her to write next week on\nWednesday\u2014she will know why.\nOn reaching Brighton I found a letter from Mrs. Forbes from\nher own home, where I did not know her to be, enclosing\nthe automatic writing mentioned in No. XXXIV., written on\nWednesday, April 1st. In a subsequent letter, April 6th, Mrs.\nForbes told me that on Wednesday, April 1st, after she\nfinished her letter to me her hand wrote automatically some\nthing about writing on Wednesday. She was uncertain\nwhether this referred to the past or future, but finding on\nexamination that she had not written on Wednesday, March\n25th, she took it to refer to Wednesday, April 8th. In that\ncase her script of April 1st and mine of April 2nd agreed\nin recommending that Mrs. Forbes should write on Wednesday,\nApril 8th.1\n<XLV.) April 8th and 10th.\nMrs. Forbes' script of the 8th contained further allusions to\nthe attempt to reproduce a word wanted by me.\nA new point, however, was introduced into her script by\nthe word \" daughter \" in connexion with me, apparently\nsuggesting that my daughter should take some part in this\ninterconnexion.2 This suggestion, so vague on April 8th that\nI might have overlooked it altogether, was emphasised in Mrs.\nForbes' script of April 10th. This began with a statement\nthat something was to be corrected in the script of April 8th;\nit went on with a message, absolutely unintelligible to Mrs.\nForbes and me but with a meaning for my daughter; it\nthen said that the automatic writing would be far less\ndifficult to understand if \" the younger Verrall \" wrote with\n1 Mrs. Forbes' script about writing on Wednesday has not been\npreserved. It was produced when she was laid up in bed and had\nno proper paper or pencil at hand. \" So as evidence it is value\nless,\" as she wrote on April 6th.\n2 The actual words were : \" Tell Mrs. Verrall's . . . you . . . one of\ndaughter more.\"\n\f254 Chapter XL [PART\nPlanchette; and finally suggested that my daughter and I\nshould sit simultaneously with Mrs. Forbes on Sunday, i.e.\nApril 12th. The meaning was made perfectly clear by the\naddition on April llth that by \"Verrall\" \"Helen Verrall\" was\nintended.\nThe actual words were as follows; April 10th:\nWill you be so good as to write\u2014to arrive to-morrow\u2014\nto tell Mrs. Verrall our letter must be read with one word\ncorrected which means more. E.G. . . . A grower of flowers\none year will be sower of seed\u2014Send this message.

She had been staying from March 25th to April\n2nd, with a friend who is a professional gardener, and during her\nvisit there was much discussion over a suggestion of her friend's\nnew head-man that certain plants should be grown from seed\nwhich hitherto had been raised from cuttings. The new man\nwas particularly skilled in raising plants from seed. My\ndaughter who is very familiar with the methods of her gardener-\nfriend, was much interested in the discussion ; and she at once\nrecognised a reference to this subject in the phrase \"a grower\nof flowers one year will be sower of seed.\"\nThe above facts were entirely unknown to me, and Mrs.\nForbes had no knowledge of my daughter's movements or\nthat she had any horticultural friend.\n(XLVI.) April 14th-18th, 1903.\nFrom April J.4th-18th my daughter and I stayed with\nMrs. Forbes, but no allusions to Mrs. Forbes appear in my\nscript of April 17th, the only one obtained during the visit.\n(XLVII.)

The\nscript then went on to say that I should be in telepathic\ncommunication with a friend, \" Mrs. S, Alice.\"\nNot much can be made of the first paragraph. My husband\nthought that he had placed the missing paper in the left-\nhand drawer of his study table which has a key, though for\nsome reason the lock does not work. But he thinks that\nthe words, written on paper, were placed inside an envelope,\nso that the description, \"a simple open letter,\" are hardly\nsuitable. Mrs. Forbes, it should be remembered, had received\nno information about our loss.\nThe second suggestion about my friend is interesting. On\nMay 2nd, the date of Mrs. Forbes' script, I had received a\nletter from my friend, Mrs. Dew Smith (Alice) about a correct\nreference to her in my script of April 27th.1 Mrs. Forbes and\nMrs. Dew Smith are not acquainted, nor had I spoken of Mrs.\nDew Smith to Mrs. Forbes.\n(XLVIII.) May 10th and 12th, 1903.\nAnother attempt, this time by Mrs. Forbes and Mrs. Baltimore\ntogether to pursue the lost paper, seems to have failed : \" Write\nto Mrs. Verrall and tell her to seek still further for the\npaper\u2014Mr. Verrall's. Mr. (or Mrs.) Verrall left it on the\nshelf where she was looking.\nThis was wholly unintelligible, and no light was thrown by\nanother reference to the subject in Mrs. Forbes' script of May\n12th.

June 30th, 1903.\nMrs. Forbes' script of June 30th, 1903, possibly showed\nknowledge of what I was thinking about at the time, but the\nreference is very vague. At the end of June, or quite early\nin July, certainly before July 3rd, we received in Switzerland\nnews of the very serious illness of a relative, and anxiously\nwaited further news from Brighton. On June 30th Mrs.\nForbes' script wrote : Mrs. Verrall is trying to see with\nBrighton friends who send the letter to be read. H. writes\nwith sympathy. This message she was told to send to me,\nand it reached me on July 6th.\n<LI.) July 10th, 1903.\nMrs. Forbes' script of July 10th, 1903, contained for the\nfirst time the name of a person known only by name and\nreputation to her and to me. The incident is only mentioned\non account of its possible effect on my own subsequent\nwriting, for shortly afterwards, on July 21, 1903, my script\nproduced allusions to the same person.\n(LIT.)

She asked me to tell her whether it had\nhad any effect at all, but told me that her script of July 29th\nhad written : Worth while to try the experiment but the lilies\nwould grow by our own garden, from which she concluded\nthat I had had no reference to them.\nI had no automatic script after July 21st and before\nhearing from Mrs. Forbes of her experiment, so that as regards\nmy script there had been no chance of testing the experiment.\nI had no impression of Mrs. Forbes or of lilies in the required\nperiod. My daughter was occasionally obtaining automatic\nwriting at this time, and on July 26th, about 9.10 p.m., some\nsix hours after Mrs. Forbes' recorded desire that Edmund\nGurney should impress an idea upon me, she had, I found,\nobtained writing, signed for the first and only time with the\nsignature \" E. Gurney,\" resembling, as I noted at the time,\nthe same signature as it appears in Mrs. Forbes' script. My\ndaughter had never seen any signature of Mr. Gurney's, but\nas she had tried Planchette with Mrs. Forbes, it may be taken\nthat she knew how that signature appeared in Mrs. Forbes'\nscript. The style, then, of the signature is not evidential, but\nit struck me as interesting that such a signature should appear\nat all in my daughter's writing, and especially at this time,\nand for this reason I expected some further development of the\nincident.\nI said nothing to my daughter of Mrs. Forbes' experiment.\nOn August 23rd my daughter had a reference in her script\nto lilies, and to Mrs. Forbes, so that it seemed as though the\nexperiment might be producing an effect. There were other\npoints in the script, and I wrote on August 24th to enquire\nif they applied to Mrs. Forbes. My letter was as follows :\n\" The exact message is this ' if you had seen her picking the\nlilies you would have understood,' then she goes on about 'a\nred light,' which she first wrote about in your house, shewing\nthat you are somewhere in the mind of the writer, and finally\ncomes this, ' the house is large and there is a belt of rhodo\ndendrons. In the north you have seen it. Go and look.\nRenoldson is a clue. What about those daisies ? Did you\npick them after all ? Not you I mean but Mrs. Forbes.' Then\ncomes a Latin sentence saying that the memory of these\nR\n\f258 Chapter XI. [PART\nthings will not be incorrect as of all things they were what\npleased (him or her)1 most.\" I asked whether any of this\nmeant anything to Mrs. Forbes and said that we knew of no\nhouse with a belt of rhododendrons, though the next sentence\nof the script might mean that Mrs. Forbes' house is in the\nnorth, and that my daughter had seen it.\nTo these questions Mrs. Forbes answered as follows : \" There\nwas no effort [on my part] to ' impress ' it [i.e. the message].\nI looked at the lilies, cut some and mentally asked if it would\nbe possible to tell ' our friends at Cambridge ' [i.e. the Verralls]\nabout them. We have been planting a belt of rhododendrons\nin the little wood to the north of the garden and I have often\nlooked to see if they were growing. The lilies were distinctly\nthe things that pleased me most in the garden this summer.\"\nIt thus appears that my daughter's script of August 28th\nwas correct in stating that the lilies were picked by Mrs. Forbes.\nIt is correct also in connecting with the lilies a belt of rhodo\ndendrons, of which neither my daughter nor I had any normal\nknowledge,2 as the planting of these rhododendrons was subse\nquent to our visit. The obscure Latin sentence with which\nthe script concludes, if interpreted as I did interpret it at the\ntime, is appropriate, as Mrs. Forbes points out, the lilies having\nbeen chosen as the subject of experiment at a moment when\nthe pleasure derived from them was felt.\nWe cannot see that \" Renoldson is a clue,\" nor do the\n\" daisies \" seem to have any meaning in this incident. But\nthere can, I think, be little doubt that the allusions in my\ndaughter's script of August 23rd, following on the signature\nin her script of July 26th, are the direct result of Mrs.\nForbes' experiment, wholly unknown to her, of July 26th.3\n1 Latin ei. The sentence runs thus : \" scilicet memoria harum rerum\nnon fallet quod ex omnibus maximum ei praefuere.\"\n2 This is shown plainly in my letter of August 24th to Mrs.\nForbes.\n3 This incident finds a parallel in the incident described on p. 213.\nThere an attempt on the part of Mrs. Piper's trance-personality to\nmake an impression upon my daughter seems to have missed its\naim, and to have been recorded in my script. Here, on the contrary,\nan attempt on Mrs. Forbes' part to impress me failed, but was\nrecorded in my daughter's script.\n\fLIU.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 259\n<LIV.)

In my script of July 21st something\nhad been written about a picture at Venice,1 and on July 31st\n(No. 26) the scribe wrote as follows :\nThe picture in the picture-frame\u2014upon the wall\u2014& no name\nupon it\u2014in her room, ask Mrs. Forbes. She has thought lately\nof the picture, and will remember.\nAnd again, after an interval:\nask Mrs. Forbes whether she knows the likeness in the picture\u2014\nshe may know. Go into the gallery at Venice, the lady with the\npearls.\nAnd again:\nMore another time, but ask Mrs. Forbes if she knows. More\nthrough Helen later. Do not tire her.\nOn August 10th, in answer to enquiry, I learned from\nMrs. Forbes that she had lately put a tiny sketch of Venice\ninto a frame. There was no name on the sketch. The picture\nwas not hung, but was resting against the wall in the drawing-\nroom. It had been framed before July 31st. The words, then,\nof the script about the \" picture in the picture-frame,\" which\nseemed unmeaning to me, are intelligible if referred to a recently\nframed picture, and the other statements in the same paragraph\nare in that case correct. The later paragraphs conveyed no\nmeaning to Mrs. Forbes.\nThe reference in my script of July 21st to a picture at\nVenice and the subsequently received information that Mrs.\nForbes was likely to go to Italy, may well account for the\nsuggestion in the script of July 31st that Mrs. Forbes should\nbe asked to look for a picture there, but does not account for the\nproduction of the statement concerning the picture in a frame\nin Mrs. Forbes' room lately thought of by her.\n<LV.) August llth, 1903.\nOn August llth, 1903, in speaking to a friend, Mr. M. A.\nBayfield, of S.P.R. investigations and the difficulty of coming\n1 I have never been to Venice. The picture described was apparently\na portrait resembling some one unknown to me.\n\f260 Chapter XI. [PART\nto any conclusions, I used the phrase, \" Anyhow they teach\none patience, which is perhaps the hardest thing to learn.\"\nOn August 12th I received from Mrs. Forbes a copy of\nPlanchette writing obtained by herself and Mrs. Baltimore.\nThe last lesson to be learned is Patience; Mrs. Verrall is\nour friend who has so much\u2014she will be rewarded by making\nplain the tangle. The expression struck me as closely recalling\nmy words of the same date.1 The script was received by\nthe first post with no explanation ; by the second post followed\na letter from Mrs. Forbes explaining that there had been an\n\"insistent command\" to send the message to me by a \"mes\nsenger we could trust,\" and that they had hastily written it\nout for Mrs. Baltimore to post herself. This seems to show\nan impression on the side of the Planchette writers that the\ndate of the Planchette message was important, that is to say\nthat the message referred to something specific and was not\nmerely general.\n(LVI.) August 18th, 1903.\nOn August 18th, 1903, Mrs. Forbes had two messages for\nme at the beginning and end of the morning : 10 a.m. Great\nsympathy for our friends . . . Death . . . Talbot writes to\nsay it will be better\u2014Mrs. Verrall writes first. 1.45 p.m.,\nafter general directions to write automatically, Mother of\nHelen writes\u2014Mrs. Verrall . . . your son's name gives the\nclue.\nThis is too vague to be useful. A friend of mine, unknown\nto Mrs. Forbes, was very seriously ill at the time and died\nten days later. The name Talbot has no connexion with\nthis friend.\n(LVII.) October 6th and 7th, 1903.\nSoon after the last mentioned writing Mrs. Forbes went\nabroad, and no further intercourse took place till after her\nreturn. On October 6th my script (No. 27) wrote :\n!I have no note as to which came first, the Planchette-writing\nor our conversation. I mentioned the Planchette-writing to Mr.\nBayfield as soon as I received the letter, and he, like me, was\nstruck with the connexion indicated between the Planchette message\nand the sentiment expressed by me on the preceding day.\n\fLIIL] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 261\nMrs. Forbes comes home this week and will have a message for\nyou. But she found no picture at Venice. She has had a success\nwhile she was away\u2014ask about it. Her mother will want her much\nthis winter\u2014she will be in the south.\nAnd on October 7th (No. 28) it added :\nWrite to Mrs. Forbes\u2014tell her not to look for the chain\u2014any\n,other trinket will do as well. That is not quite right, but I think\nshe will understand.\nIn my suggestion to Mrs. Forbes to look for a portrait at\nVenice described in my script I had included the phrase, \"the\nlady with the pearls.\" On August 23rd, in the same writing\nof my daughter's which alluded to Mrs. Forbes\" experiment\nwith the lilies (No. LIII.) came the phrase, \"why did Mrs.\nVerrall not understand about those pearls. We said it plainly,\nIt is a clue.\"1 This correction about the pearls may possibly\nTiave been the further help \" through Helen \" promised in my\nscript of July 31st. In any case the script of October 7th\nseems to have intended to correct an impression of Mrs. Forbes\nabout the pearls. On October 8th Mrs. Forbes, after receiving\nmy script of October 7th, wrote to me that the message about\nnot looking for the chain was appropriate, for she had looked\n\u2022with much care for a chain of pearls, and did not believe there\nwas any portrait of a lady wearing one in Venice. The writing,\ntherefore, of October 7th was at least intelligible to Mrs. Forbes,\nand it claimed perhaps no more.\nThe script of October 6th made three statements. The first\nthat Mrs. Forbes was coming home that week and that she\nfound no such picture at Venice as described, was correct, but\nnot beyond a guess. The second, that she had a success while\nshe was away, corresponded to her own feeling ; at Venice\nthere came to her an impression which explained some things\nunintelligible hitherto.2\nThe third statement is much more definite and proved to\nbe correct, though I had no normal ground for any such\n1 My daughter knew nothing of the allusions in my script to the\nlady with the pearls.\n2 This impression was told by her to me, and my estimate of it\nconfirms her own.\n\f262 Chapter XL [PART\nconjecture. On November 30th, when Mrs. Forbes spent one\nnight with me, she told me of her mother's illness. Naturally\nI said nothing of the above script. On December 2nd she\nwas telegraphed for to go to her mother's house in the south,\nwhence she wrote to me on December oth saying that she\nwould have to stay a long time away from home, and noting\nthe difficulty caused by the distance between her own and\nher mother's home.\n(LVIII.) October 27th, 1903.\nBetween October 9th and 12th it was arranged that I\nshould sit for the first time with a friend in town on the last\nTuesday of October (27th) and the first Tuesday in November\n(3rd). Of this Mrs. Forbes knew nothing beyond the fact that\nI was going to town some time before November 18th, and\nhoped to do some experiments there. In her automatic script\nof October 22nd or 23rd she had a confused message about\nme which her script instructed her to send to Mr. Piddington.\nIn this it was said that the last\u2014day of October 1 would be the\nfirst sitting. I heard of this from her in a letter written on\nOctober 27th, asking whether I had had any writing on the\n22nd and 23rd which might account for her message ; the\nmessage itself had been sent to Mr. Piddington according to\nthe script's instructions instead of to me.\n(LIX.) October 30th, 1903.\nMy script of October 30th, 1903 (No. 29), wrote :\nSend this Blue forget-me-nots tied with short lengths of ribbon\n\u2014ask Mrs. Forbes to send you a flower. I have given her one\nmessage about you.\nI took no notice of this and nothing came of it.\n(LX.) November 23rd, 1903.\nOn November 23rd, 1903, my script wrote as follows (No.\n30):\n1 There was a space before 'day,' so that it was not clear what\nwas intended, whether 'day,' or some named day, such e.g. a&\n'Monday\/ 'Tuesday.'\n\fLiu.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 263\nMrs. Forbes has a special message for you which you will\nunderstand.\ndXAo TI ovSf croi P.OVIJ *\nOres cent saecla\nCrenent crest [then a drawing of the Gurwood crest] 1\nlook up that for help.\nGurney wrote the word ask Mrs. Forbes.\n[drawing of four-petalled flower]\nThe broken words in the middle of this writing I took to\nbe gradual emergences of the name Gurney passing through\nCrest and Gurwood. So -that, omitting the final drawing, all\nit came to was a statement that Gurney wrote a word for me,\nand apparently alluded to this in a message to Mrs. Forbes.\nI heard nothing from Mrs. Forbes, so on November 25th I\nwrote telling her of the opening words only : \" Mrs. Forbes has\na special message for you which you will understand.\" On\nNovember 27th her script had as follows : H. must\nsend the . . . word (? ward) to be with Edmund Gurney,\nand again : Would you send Mrs. Verrall a message ?\nbe sure it is sent. Edmund Gurney, Talbot and H.\nwrite Mrs. VerraU's script. If her reading \"word\" is correct,\nthere is perhaps a connexion between her script of\nNovember 27th and that part of mine of the 23rd, which\nshe had not seen. The reference to \"Gurney\" in both scripts\ndoes not count, as the name often comes in her writing, though\nrarely in mine.2 No script of hers, however, was forthcoming\ntill I asked whether she had a message, and the distinctive\nfeatures of my script, the drawings and the word \" crest,\"\nwere lacking in hers.\nOn November 29th my daughter, who knew nothing of\nthe above,3 wrote automatically : \" Mrs. Forbes will have a\n* Trans. \" Something else and not for you alone.\"\n^or the Gurwood crest see S.P.K. Journal, Vol. IV. p. 174.\n2 On no other occasion in conjunction with the name of Mrs.\nForbes.\n3 My daughter knew that Mrs. Forbes was shortly coming to stay\nwith me, and that another automatist had, on November 3rd, implied\nthat simultaneous messages to two sensitives from E. G. might be\nexpected.\n\f264 Chapter XI. [PART\nmessage about Gurney,\" and these words were followed by two\nquadruple drawings, distinctly resembling the four-petalled\nflower in my script of the 23rd. The second of these draw\nings was described as \"shamrock four-leaved.\"\nWhether then there be a connexion or not between my\nscript of November 23rd and Mrs. Forbes' of November 27th,\nthere seems to have been a reflexion of mine in my daughter's\nwriting of November 5J9th, inasmuch as her script, like mine,\ncombined the names of Gurney and Mrs. Forbes, and contained\na sketch of a four-petalled flower.\n(LXI.) November 30th, 1903.\nMrs. Forbes stayed with me on November 30th for one\nnight.\n(LXII.) January 9th, 1904.\nThe next incident seems to be of the same type as above\n(XXV.), where a message intended for me apparently went\nto Mrs. Forbes. But here the process was reversed. It was\nonly when she applied to me for her message that I recognised\nany meaning in my script. The incident is somewhat com\nplicated.\nOn December llth, 1903, we left home for a long absence\nin Algeria. No communication passed between Mrs. Forbes\nand me, and I had no references to her for some time. On\nDecember 27th my script made one of the appointments for\nwriting above described : 1\n\" Count days five, six and two, then listen and remember.\"\n1 The last paragraph of the script was as follows :\n\"I have told you that the letter will come, I cannot say when,\nbut I see it open in your hands and your surprise; it is\nnearer now than when I wrote before, but not immediate. count\ndays five six and two, then listen and remember.\"\nIt is possible that this was intended to say that on the day\nindicated a letter would arrive. But the words \" then listen \" sug\ngested that I was to write automatically, and that was the\ninterpretation I placed upon them.\nOn the day before, December 26th, there had been a remark\nabout a letter coming to me \" from her \" that \" gives the news\u2014\n\fLIII.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 265\nAccordingly, after thirteen days, on January 9th (No. 31) I\ntried for writing, and after statements in English, came the\nfollowing paragraph in Latin :\nSolacia attamen eiusdem doloris nee mihi nee tibi attinget\u2014\nab aliis accipere debes : post septimam diem omnia comprehendere\npoles. Fac scribas die septimo decimo.*\nI could make nothing of this, though some points were\nclear. An interpretation was to be expected on the seventh\nday, i.e. on January 16th. Nothing else was evident except\nthat there was a reference to consolation for some grief.\nOn Saturday, January 16th, by the English mail at one\no'clock p.m., I received a letter from Mrs. Forbes, saying : \" I\nhave been told to ask you to send me your last week's script;\nmy message is as follows : H. wrote the last week's message\nto be sent to you\u2014ask Mrs. Verrall to send it H. wrote the\nmessage on ! for the friend at Cambridge see if it is true\nwrite to ask her for the last week's script.\"\nThere was only one piece of script that could be described\nas the last week's script, viz., that of Saturday, January 9th.\nThere had been script on December 25th, 26th, 27th, 29th, and\nJanuary 1st ; then only on January 9th. There was thus only\none piece of writing produced in the course of the week\npreceding the date of Mrs. Forbes' letter, which was January\n12th, and that was the piece containing an unintelligible\nwait and be patient I cannot say what yon will think but I see\nyour surprise\nnee urna deest, cineribus impleta tuorum.a\nIt is not what you think, don't try to understand wait.\"\nThe two allusions to a coming letter are no doubt connected, but\nwhether they have any reference to Mrs. Forbes and myself I\ncannot say.\n[\" Trans. \" Nor is there lacking the urn filled with the ashes of\nyour dead.\"]\n* Trans. \" Nevertheless consolation for the same grief will concern (1)\nneither me nor you\u2014you ought to receive it from others : after the\nseventh day you will be able to understand everything. Write on\nthe seventeenth day.\"\n1 The word in this gap Mrs. Forbes marked as not very clear ; it\nmight, she wrote, be \"yesterday\" or \"Wednesday.\"\n\f266 Chapter XI. [PART\nmessage, for the explanation of which I was told to wait\nseven days. The letter from Mrs. Forbes, received on the 7th\nday, furnished the prospect of an explanation, and I sent to\nher a copy of the script, asking if the contents were intelli\ngible to her.\nOn January 27th I received her reply, enclosing copies of\nher writing in early January, and telling me, what I did not\nknow, that January 6th was the anniversary of her son's\ndeath. The script obtained by her was as follows : (a) On\nJanuary 4th a confused message that Mr. Gurney wanted to\nsend a message to me; (6) on January 5th a statement sug\ngesting some connexion between her and me, followed by an\nallusion to the loss of her son in the words : Will be with your\nloss of your only son one of worthy parentage one who well\ndeserves . . . well rewarded. Follow this . . . it is Mrs.\n. . . rall sends the answer who cares for it . . . this evi\ndence is wor . . . Edmund writes tell this message Write\nto the friends of Cambridge they are the . . .

Mrs.\nForbes did not communicate with me at once, and on January\n12th her script plainly told her to ask for a particular piece of\nmy script. The piece of my script so asked for contained a\nremark about consolation for sorrow, unintelligible to me, but\nexplained, as promised in my script, seven days after its\nreception.1\nThe above incident made a considerable impression on Mrs.\nForbes and me at the time, one of the best points being the\nabsence of unexplained or superfluous remarks in the script\n1The Latin nee mihi nee tibi attinget is difficult to interpret. I\nhave translated it : \" will concern neither me nor you,\" i.e. \" the\ngrief is not ours.\" This interpretation is made more likely by the\nnext words plainly referring to others from whom I am to hear.\n\fLIII.] Gross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 267\nconcerned. It is true that Mrs. Forbes' name does not occur\nin my script but the script, by giving precisely the day on\nwhich I was to receive explanation, definitely connects itself\nwith Mrs. Forbes, from whom I received the explanation on\nthat day. Mrs. Forbes' script was also quite clear ; an inter\nrupted message of consolation to her was confirmed by some\nthing in a piece of my writing which she obtained in answer\nto instructions in her own script, and which, without those\ninstructions, she would certainly not have obtained.1\n(LXIII.) January 25th, 1904.\nOn January 25th, 1904, after the receipt of the letter asking\nfor my script but before the completion of the explanation,\nmy script referred to Mrs. Forbes (No. 32) as follows :\nMrs. Forbes message was wrong listen to this : A letter from\nMr. Forbes to her at Cranford will go this month.\nThe first words are an obvious reflexion of my own know\nledge, about the mis-sent message. The last sentence is too\nvague for verification. It was very probable that some time\nin the course of January Mrs. Forbes, if Mrs. Forbes is intended,\nwould receive a letter from her husband at Cranford, the\nname of her mother's house.\n(LXIV.) April 13th, 1904.\nOn April 13th, 1904, my daughter and I, trying Planchette,\nobtained some references to Mrs. Forbes, vague and of no value.\n(LXV.) July 13th-16th, 1904.\nOn July 13th, 1904, after a long interval2 Mrs. Forbes'\nscript wrote an expression of desire to send a message cor\nrectly to me. Mrs. Forbes was told in the script to send\n1 It may be noted that, as I had no notion for whom the message\nof consolation was intended, I could not convey it to any one, and\nMrs. Forbes would therefore have known nothing about it had she\nnot, at the suggestion of her script, written to ask me to send her a\nparticular bit of my writing.\n2 There was no communication between January 9th-27th (LXII.\nLXIII.) and July 13th, except (1) the Planchette writing of April\n13th (LXIV), (2) a vague message in Mrs. Forbes' writing on May\n24th to tell me to persevere, and (3) a letter from her about other\nmatters on June 1st.\n\f268 Chapter XL [PART\nthis message to me and to tell me to begin to write from\nto-morrow (i.e. July 14th, 1904). The message reached me on\nJuly 14th. On July 13th, my own script definitely stated that\n\" the sentence from the Symposium \" was in a sealed envelope\nbelonging to Sir Oliver Lodge. This statement was incorrect.1\nIf Mrs. Forbes' script, produced, after long silence, was in\ntended as a correction of mine, it failed of its purpose, being\ntoo indefinite. At the time it appeared more like a corroboration\nthan a correction. But its contents are too undefined to be\nclassified.\nI was prevented from writing on July 14th. My script\n(No. 33), on July 15th contained the words:\nI cannot get the Greek words to Mrs. Forbes,\na mere reminiscence, as it appeared to me, of the long efforts of\nher script to give the words of the Symposium.\nOn July 16th Mrs. Forbes' script suggested that some\nepisode was now closed and that some distinct success had\nbeen accomplished; this information was to be sent to me.\nThe words are : Our dream of our own home will soon be\nrealized.

It is long\nsince you wrote.\nIn answer to enquiries, Mrs. Forbes wrote on October 15th\nthat on the morning of Monday, October 3rd, she was visiting\na cousin of Talbot Forbes, a man, A. W. Forbes. The initials\n1 See below, p. 301.\n\fLIU.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 269\nA.

But nothing\ncan be made of the incident.\n(LXVII.) October 14th and 15th, 1904.\nIn a letter of October 15th Mrs. Forbes told me of a\nsuggestion made in her script of October 14th, that I\nshould sit on Sunday, October 16th, to obtain some story\nscene or episode. Tell Mrs. Verrall we will send the scene to\nher . . , write this message I will send the scene to Mrs-\nVerrall to be read by you. E.G.\nI received this letter on the morning of October 16th. I\nhad no time to write till quite late in the evening. At 10.30\np.m. (No. 35), after other writing not bearing on the suggested\nexperiment, my script wrote the following :\nTell this.\nin the fire-lighted room she & the dog alone, and the\nthought came to her as she held up the screen before the fire\u2014\nand the dog stirred in his sleep\u2014he felt that I was there.\nIt was only for a moment\u2014but the scene was plain. Will\nthis meet your point? It is all that I can do\ntonight.1\nIn addition to the writing, quite contrary to my usual\nhabit, I had a mental impression as I finished the script\nof Mrs. Forbes sitting in her drawing-room, with the door into\nthe greenhouse open ; through that door a shadowy figure, which\nI knew to be Talbot, came and stood in the window looking\nat Mrs. Forbes.2\n1 In a different hand.\n2 Mrs. Forbes' drawing-room is known to me. It has two doors\nat opposite ends of the room. The fireplace is opposite the entrance\ndoor, and beside the fireplace is the door into the greenhouse. Close\nto this door is a large window. The figure of which I had an\nimpression came through the open greenhouse door and stood in\nthe window. Mrs. Forbes was sitting on the further side of the\nfireplace, in her usual place. This impression was not noted at\nthe time of writing the script. It was noted on October 21st after\nhearing from Mrs. Forbes that the general description in my script\nwas correct, and before sending her the questions to which I received\ndefinite answers on October 25th.\n\f270 Chapter XI. [PART\nI was expecting the script to produce \"a story, scene or\nepisode,\" but from my knowledge of Mrs. Forbes' habits I\nthought it so unlikely that she would have been writing at\nany hour when the room could be described as \" fire-lighted \"\u2014\nwhich I took to mean at dusk before the lights were brought\nin\u2014that I did not send the script to her. She usually writes\nautomatically in the morning and has once or twice on a\nSunday written at 2 p.m.\nOn October 18th I heard from her enclosing her script\nproduced on October 16th at 5.45 p.m. The hour was not\ninconsistent with the statement in my script, and the contents\nof her script seemed also to show some coincidence. She\nwrote : Gurney . . . write to you . . . from Cambridge\nQ . . . you will be written to for a test is being given\u2014\na very strong evidence . . . message will be given . . . go on\nsitting after tea it is a good time I am free to sit here then\nI wish you could be with me to see me\u2014\/ will try to send\nthe evidence we want.

In answer to detailed questions subsequently\n1 It is common for the supposed Talbot to give no name, and\nthe comparative fluency of the sentences points to him as communi\ncator. It is clear that \"Gurney\" is spoken of in the third person.\n2 The suggestion of connexion with me cannot be reckoned among\ncoincidences, as Mrs. Forbes had proposed I should sit some time\non Oct. 16th.\n\fLIU.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 271\nsent she replied, in a letter received on October 25th, as\nfollows : 1 She was sitting in the drawing-room, there was a\nsmall lamp behind her but little light. There was one dog\nand one dog only in the room. She was not able to say\nwhether the dog stirred at any special moment. She was\nholding a piece of paper as a screen in her hand. The door\nto the greenhouse was open. I had not mentioned my\nimpression to her but had asked the question, \" Had you any\nthought of the door to the greenhouse ? \" and to this she\nreplied, \"The door to the greenhouse was open. \/ always\nthink of it before I settle down to read or write, as I see\nmyself that it is open.\"\nThe script was therefore fairly correct in its statements. The\nword \" fire-lighted,\" if taken strictly to mean unlighted other\nwise, is not correct, but it perhaps can be interpreted less\nstrictly. Mrs. Forbes and the dog were alone; there had been\ntwo dogs constantly with her when I last stayed at the house,\nbut only one was in the room on this occasion. She was holding\na piece of paper as a screen. The impression which I had that\nthe greenhouse door was open was correct. There was no\nreason as far as I know why I should think of the greenhouse\n\u2022door at all. My so doing clearly established that the room\nin question was the drawing-room. This at the time struck\nme, as I associate Mrs. Forbes' automatic writing with her own\nsitting-room and a particular desk at which she usually sits.\nApparently there was some appropriateness in the allusion\nto the open greenhouse door, as her answer to my question\nshows that she habitually sits with the greenhouse door open,\nhabit of hers not consciously observed by me.\n{LXVIII.)

I could not make her hear what I wanted her to write to\nyou\u2014but ask to see what she wrote on Monday.\nAfter this I wrote to Mrs. Forbes as the experiment had\nobviously failed. She replied that she had written no script\non the preceding Monday (January 2nd), having hardly had\nany opportunity of writing for a long time. She had had\nvery little script for some weeks, and neither in the script\nnor otherwise any special impression about me or the opening\nof a sealed envelope. The attempt therefore to impress her\nwith a sense of my disappointment was a complete failure.\nThe foregoing account of what I have called the cross-corre\nspondences between Mrs. Forbes and me is as complete as I\n1 Six + three, i.e. nine days after December 28th.

Premature classification is apt to\nconfuse, and the selection of isolated incidents\u2014itself a species\nof classification\u2014is open to the further objection that, even\nwhen the principle of selection is clearly laid down, no oppor\ntunity is given to the reader of checking its application\nMoreover, the exclusion from consideration of certain cases in\na series may be positively misleading unless accompanied by\na clear statement of the relative frequency of success compared\nwith failure in the excluded as well as in the included instances,\nand such an Application of the statistical method is impossible\nwhere the cases do not admit of unmistakeable division into\ntwo classes and two only. There are few incidents in the long\npreceding narrative which could, without further qualification,\nbe indisputably labelled as successes or failures.\nUnder these circumstances a complete and chronological\naccount of the coincidences seems necessary if any judgment is to\nbe formed. The historical arrangement has the further advantage\nthat it enables the reader to understand the conditions under\nwhich the phenomena were produced, to ascertain, namely,\nwhat knowledge and what expectation was present in the\nmind of the writers on each particular occasion. Here, in\nsome respects, the present case offers special facilities. Where\nthe persons concerned are in constant and familiar communica\ntion it is not easy to ascertain what at any given point\nwas the information possessed by either party. Here, how\never, the acquaintance of Mrs. Forbes and myself preceded but\nby a month or two the first incident in the series of cross-\ncorrespondences, and even during the four succeeding years,\n1901-1904, our opportunities for meeting were few.\nWe both were sufficiently familiar with the methods of\n1 Every identifiable reference to Mrs. Forbes, whether by name\nor allusion, in my script appears verbatim in the above. In the case\nof Mrs. Forbes' script I have occasionally paraphrased instead of\ntranscribing, but wherever the phraseology seemed of importance I\nhave given the actual words. I have not included certain pieces of\nher writing which were amplifications, confirmations, or reminiscences\nof preceding script. Everything, however, of the nature of a state\nment, correction, or addition, has been included.\ns\n\f274 Chapter XI. [PART\ninvestigation required in such cases to realise not only the\nimportance of preserving documents and obtaining external\ncorroboration, but also the value of noting before and after\nverification any information that could throw light upon the\nproduction of the script. Every letter that passed between\nus has been kept. Many notes as to antecedent knowledge or\nimpression were made for our own or the other's use. We\nwere also aware of the confusion often introduced into the\nscript by involuntary efforts at guessing on the part of the\nwriter. It is to be remembered that neither Mrs. Forbes nor\nI are in any way unconscious during the production of the\nscript, and so a natural tendency to complete a word of which\nthe first letters or syllables are given is often exhibited, when\nsome part of the automatic writing emerges more definitely\ninto consciousness than the rest, and this guessing may tend to\nspoil or inhibit the phenomena.\nIt was to diminish this source of error and to make easier the\nrecord of antecedent normal knowledge that Mrs. Forbes consented\nfor months to send me all writing referring to myself without\nreceiving from me any indication as to the value of her pro\nductions or any but the vaguest encouragement.1 Without\nsome such general encouragement the experiment could hardly\nhave been carried through. The continued production of what\nis unintelligible to oneself and not enthusiastically received by\nits only other reader is at best a laborious and thankless\ntask, and I wish here to express my great gratitude to Mrs.\nForbes for the patience and care which she exhibited throughout\nand not least in this particular respect.\nAs to the value of the whole narrative, or the interest of\nparticular incidents, the reader must form his own opinion ;\nthere are two points in Mrs. Forbes' script to which I will\ncall attention.\n(1) Difficulty of verbal expression.\nThis, a characteristic to some extent of all automatic writing,\nis specially marked in Mrs. Forbes' script, much more so, for\n1 It was not till after the opening of the sealed envelope in December,\n1904, that Mrs. Forbes knew that there had been in her script\nallusions which I could not mistake to an identified passage in a book.\n\fLIU.] Cross-Correspondences with Mrs. Forbes. 275\ninstance, than in my own. It often appears as though, at the\nmoment of approaching a particular word or phrase, the power,\nwhatever it is, fails, and it is not uncommon to obtain from a\ngeneral reading of the script a clear impression of its inten\ntion, hardly justified by the actual phraseology. It is, in fact,\npossible to see what it is driving at but does not precisely\nexpress in words. A similar experience is common to all who\nhave listened to a foreigner whose acquaintance with English is\nmore extensive than his command of its vocabulary. This\nis not the case with my own script, where, as the reader will\nrecall, the actual sentences are usually complete, though their\nwording is often harsh or obscure.\n(2) Dramatisation.\nThe dramatisation of the supposed communicators, and the\ndistribution among them of the various statements of the\nscript is conspicuous in the case of Mrs. Forbes, and curiously\nwell sustained. Would-be evidential matter, of a more or\nless fragmentary description, is attributed to H., and the\ngeneral direction of the phenomena to Edmund Gurney.\nThe clearest, most fluent, and most definite statements come\nfrom Talbot Forbes, who seems to intervene occasionally with\nthe object of stating clearly what has been left in confusion\nby previous efforts. There are many instances of this, but\nperhaps the most striking is the communication about the\nSymposium on December 18th, 1902.1 My own script, here\nas elsewhere, is less markedly dramatic in form. There is\nperhaps a more personal touch in its references to Mrs. Forbes\nthan in other parts, but that may be due to the influence\nof the suggestive dramatisations in Mrs. Forbes' script.\n!See XXXII.\n\f276 Chapter XII. [PART\nCHAPTER XII.\nMISCELLANEOUS REFERENCES TO PAST EVENTS.\nIN the next two chapters I have collected together all such\nreferences in the script to identifiable matter as have not already\nbeen discussed in connexion with specified persons. For con\nvenience I have divided them according as they appear to relate\nto what had already occurred at the time of writing or to what\nwas still to come. Beyond this broad division into Past and\nFuture, I have attempted no classification. The incidents show\nconsiderable differences, both in character and value. If they\nwere classified by results they would range from complete\nfailure through many intermediate classes to complete success,\nand much difference of opinion would be found as to the class\nin which a particular incident should fall. What they all\npossess is sufficient precision of statement to be connected,\nwhether correctly or not, with definite events. They are in\nfact, or claim to be, identifiable, and many have been\nidentified. In this respect they differ from the \"unidentifiable\nstatements or allusions\" described in Chapter VI., though this\ndifference may be one of degree rather than of kind, and\nso the same type of phenomenon may be represented in both.\nBut for critical purposes there is an important distinction\nbetween detailed description so far unidentified and state\nments which, even if lacking in precision, yet present a point\nof contact with an actual occurrence.\nWhere more than one reference in the script is made to\nwhat is apparently the same incident, I have grouped these\nreferences together.1 Occasionally two or three topics are so\nconstantly intermingled in the script that it has been impos\nsible to disconnect them. But I have treated the incidents\nas isolated units wherever that could be done.\n1In all cases where no quotation from the script is given in\nthis narrative, extracts will be found in the Appendix, pp. 415-29.\n\fLIII.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 277\n(1) In the first of the series of attempts to guess\ne? aw, August 13th, 1901, at a time when, as the reader will\nremember, I had no idea that my husband was trying any\nexperiment, the script produced an unmistakeable allusion to an\nincident connected with him\u2014the loss of a hat\u2014some years\nbefore. At the time the emergence of this memory seemed\nwholly arbitrary, but, on reviewing the matter after I was\nacquainted with the circumstances of his experiment, I am\ndisposed to think that some vague association of ideas may\naccount for the mention of the lost hat. The unrecognised\nintention to find something wanted by my husband may have\nrevived in my memory the recollection of a lost object\nbelonging to him. The words of the script show a conscious\nness that the loss of the hat was known to me :\nHat\u2014a black hat in a box belonging to him was lost something\nblue near it. Ask\u2014you know this\u2014a blue tie in the hat.\nThe hatbox was lost with the hat in it ; but we have no\nrecollection of a tie or anything else lost with the hat. This\nstatement therefore has no evidential value, but it marks a\nconnexion with my husband in a piece of writing unmistakeably\naiming at the word \" dawn.\" 1\n(2) A description in the script (Jan. 8th, 1902) of some\nincident occurring to a boy at school contains the word\n\" Angelns,\" following upon the phrase, \"dormitory notice.\" This\nlooks like a reminiscence of the \"Anglesea\" which was my\nhusband's dormitory at Wellington College. But he has no\nrecollection of any incident at Wellington such as it suggested,\nand the name Everitt introduced in the script has no association\nfor him.\n(3) I have grouped together two references in the script\n(on July 8th and Nov. 25th, 1901), though I am not sure that\nthey are intended to describe the same incident. Remarks\nabout a talk \"in the cloisters\"2 in the script of July 8, 1901\nseem to be definitely attributed to Dr. Sidgwick, and to be\naddressed to some one, almost certainly my husband. The\nabove, p. 160.\n2 From the context evidently the cloisters at Trinity College,\nCambridge.\n\f278 Chapter XII. [PART\nsecond script (Nov. 25, 1901) is confused. After allusions to\nMr. F. M. Balfour, and to a basket associated elsewhere with\nDr. Sidgwick,1 it refers to a talk between some one and\nmy husband in the College Court, as described on July 8th,\n1901, but there is no means of determining with precision who\nis supposed to be the speaker on this occasion.\nMy husband has no special recollection of such talks as are\ndescribed, and in the absence of further information the allusion\nin the script must be looked upon as unverified.2\n(4) Four attempts were made to produce identifiable matter\nin connexion with a basket containing fruit. The incident\nwas first introduced on July 17th, 1901, when, after reproaching\nme for not writing on July 15th, as, on June 30th, I had\nbeen instructed to do, the scribe produced remarks about a\nbasket with fruit in it, and attempted to describe a room by\nthe seaside at a place which was either Margate or Ramsgate.\nThe whole story was unmistakeably connected with Dr.\nSidgwick, the script terminating with various attempts at\nnames, among which his occurred. Later (Dec. 10th, 1901)\nMargate was given as the name, and the incident was connected\nwith Mr. Myers, and a visit of his to Margate.\nIt was a fact within my knowledge that Mr. Myers had\nvisited Dr. Sidgwick at Margate on July 7th-9th, 1900. The\ndescription of the room is not applicable to the rooms at Margate.\nFruit had been sent, but Mrs. Sidgwick has no special re\ncollection of a basket of grapes.\nThere is no evidential value, therefore, in this incident.\n(5) Another group of allusions remains completely un\nidentified. On three occasions in the early days of the script\nattempts were made to describe a place, apparently a river,\nrepresented in Latin, the ordinary language of the script at\nthat date, by \" Dovinans.\" The banks of the \" Dovinans \" are\n1 See next incident, No. 4.\n2 See, however, a letter, in May, 1900, from Dr. Sidgwick to Sir G. 0.\nTrevelyan, quoted in the recently published Memoir of Henry Sidgwick,\np. 589, where the language closely resembles that of the script of\nJuly 8, 1901. The Memoir was not published till after I had written\nthe present chapter.\n\fLIII.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 279\nmentioned on March 31st, April 8th, and May 1st, 1901.\nOn two subsequent occasions allusions appear to some word\nbeginning Dover (May 8th, 1901, March 19th, 1902), and\nonce (April 2nd, 1903) is a reference to the banks of some\nthing called Douern ; on this last occasion there is said to\nbe a cross on steps, with a wreath upon it, on the banks\nof the Douern, and somewhat illegible initials are given, the\nfirst being A, the second probably J, and the third C.1 On\nMay 23rd, 1901, occurs the phrase, \"Dominans in ripa stetit\nhagiologus \" ; 2 but it is quite likely that \" dominans in ripa \"\nis a reminiscence of \"Dovinantis in ripa,\" especially as this\npassage purports to be signed by the same signatory.\nNothing has been discovered that throws any light upon the\nname Dovinans ; it occurs only in the earliest script, which is\nusually fragmentary and unintelligible.\n(6) On three successive occasions in the summer of 1901 there\nwere references to a play which I was to identify if possible.\nThe description was not very definite,3 but clearly the reference\nwas to a MS. play connected with children and dating from a\nlong time back. The supposed communicator was not named,\nbut was plainly indicated as Dr. Sidgwick.\nAs the script had said that \"she\" would know, I asked\nMrs. Sidgwick on my return to England whether she knew\nanything about such a play and she then told me that recently\nin sorting some papers, she had come across a MS. play4 written\nand performed by children. I have now seen the play ; in\none or two points it corresponds to the description ; the\nsheets for instance, are square and the paper white ; the writing\nis crabbed and there are other childish papers with it. But\nthere are not twenty or thirty sheets,6 the writing is not very\n1 See, however, later, p. 335, for a discussion of this incident,\nwhich seems to have been verified since this chapter was written.\n2 Trans. \" Dominant on the bank stood the legend-writer.\"\n3 The three passages are given in App., p. 416.\n4 The play was written in 1856 by some children among whom\nwas the sister of Mr. Jermyn Cowell, a friend of Dr. Sidgwick's,\nto whom the MS. doubtless came among other papers on Mr.\nCowell's death in 1867.\n5 There are 18 sheets, i.e. 36 pages.\n\f280 Chapter XII. [PART\nclose and in some pages there is a margin on the right. The\nplay, moreover, is quite complete and contains nothing repre\nsenting the attempts at names in the script. The only note\nworthy point is that about the time when Mrs. Sidgwick\ncame across a childish play in MS. there was in my script a\nreference to such a play sufficiently connected in the script\nwith Dr. Sidgwick to induce me to apply to her for\ninformation.\n(7) There have been throughout the script constant refer\nences to a garden, but they are not definite enough for veri\nfication. The earlier allusions, mostly in the fragmentary and\nunintelligible Latin of the first few months of the script,\nsuggest that something is contained in the writer's garden,\n\" the dewy garden where I used to set my feet,\" but the\n\" treasures hidden in the garden \" remain undiscovered.\n(8) In three passages of- the script and in three only occur\nthree small letters xx x in juxtaposition and these same extracts\ncontain the word glyptatus. It is probable that the three\npassages are somehow connected. The first two, on March 14th\nand April 8th, 1901, are untranslatable though not altogether\nmeaningless, at least in suggestion. Both refer to a hiero-\nglyphema, whatever that may be, probably an inscription, as\nin the first case1 there are allusions to carved marble and a\nknife, and in the second case the word inscription is actually\nused, though there the hieroglyphema seems to be a puzzle\nas well as an inscription.\nOn the third occasion (Aug. 28, 1901) there is no doubt\nat all that the script refers to a circular inscription, cut on\nstone. The script speaks of a dial or font and there is a\nrough drawing which might represent either of these objects.\nA phrase earlier in the same script : \" I speak with the\ntongue of brass\u2014hard to move\" seems to indicate a sun\ndial. Reference was made to my husband on this occasion2\nand also on April 8th, but not on March 14th. Both March\n14th and April 8th contained allusions to the same personal\nfriend of ours, H.\n!See App., p. 417.\n2Thia was one of the attempts to guess nov6ir<ab.ov \u00ab <\u00ab2.\n\fLIU.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 281\nWhen my husband saw the writing of August 28th he\npointed out the references to a sundial, which I had not\nobserved, and suggested that the three x x x were intended\nas some sort of clue. We then looked through the preced\ning script and found that this same sign had occurred, as\nabove noted, on two other occasions, in both of which there\nwere references to some sort of cut inscription. It seemed\ntherefore that these three bits of writing represented successive\nattempts to say something about a sundial with an inscrip\ntion upon it. This aroused no recollection in my mind, but\nmy husband had vague reminiscences connected with an in\nscribed sundial. They may be summed up as follows :\n(1) It is certain that H. once asked my husband to com\npose a Latin inscription for a friend of his.\n(2) My husband's first recollection was that the object to be\ninscribed was a sundial, but on second thoughts he thought\nit was a mantelpiece.\n(3) At a later date he believes that Mr. G. Monkton, an\nacquaintance of ours, consulted him about an inscription and in\nso doing referred to his having already had some similar\nservice from my husband through H.\nI distinctly remember a correspondence between my husband\nand Mr. G. Monkton about an inscription, but I had no\nidea that H. had any connexion with the episode, nor do\nI recollect what was the object to be inscribed, though\nmy impression is that it was a mantelpiece. The general\noutcome of these recollections is that there were two occasions\non which my husband composed or criticised a Latin inscrip\ntion:\n(a) For a friend of H., unnamed at the time, and subsequently\nfound to be Mr. G. Moukton.\n(6) For Mr. G. Monkton at his own request.\nI certainly knew of the second and may, I suppose, have\nknown of the first. But I can recall nothing of it.\nThe description in the script is not very detailed nor par\nticularly clear, but it seems to have recalled something to my\nhusband. Some six weeks later the script accepted our\ninterpretation of these passages in the words : \" You have\n\f282 Chapter XII.

It has reached such a point that I\nmust make a note. I don't connect it with anything or any\nbody, but I am actually a little breathless,\u2014though I have\nbeen sitting still for half an hour, reading proofs. It is Bank\nholiday, and the paper has come long ago, so there is no\npost or ring at the bell to be expected. I have no desire to\nwrite automatically.\"\nLater in the morning I went out, and on my return had a\nsudden impulse to write. I began at 12.40 p.m. but was in\nterrupted for a moment, and resumed at 12.50, ending at 1.\nAfter a word or two of nonsense, and, in Latin,1 a statement\nabout the difficulty of writing, even when great care was used,\nthe frequency of mistake, and the greater facility, when I\nwas taken unawares, the script went on, after telling me to\nnote the time, to describe a fire. The points mentioned were\nthe burning and destruction of a house\u2014the absence of the\nmaster\u2014the destruction of pictures\u2014the black smoke, strong\nsmell, and crackling of flames\u2014the considerable and noteworthy\ndamage\u2014the presence of excited inhabitants\u2014the hindrance\ncaused by the wind\u2014the arrival at last of a fire engine\ndrawn by horses amid the shouts of a crowd\u2014the licking\nand flickering of the flames and their extinction in smoke\n\u2014the subsequent lamentation \" not accompanied by groans\nand tears.\" It was then stated that the occurrence was\nrecent, and that if I noted it at once its truth would be\nmanifest.\nIn the Times of the next morning, May 28th, I found a\nshort paragraph as follows : \" A fire occurred yesterday at the\nLady Artists' Club, Blythswood Square, Glasgow. Before the\nflames were extinguished over 60 oil and water colour pic\ntures on exhibition in the salon were destroyed.\" Subsequent\n1 The original Latin is given in App., p. 418.

There was no lamentation, no shouting crowd, no\ndisturbing wind. A more serious inaccuracy is contained in\nthe words dominus absens, \"the master was not there.\" As\nwill be seen, the premises being a Club, there was no master\nat all, and no responsible person was, as a fact, absent at the\ntime. On the other hand, the fire was extinguished by a fire\nengine drawn by horses, and the destruction of pictures is a,n\nimportant point in common between the description and the\nfact. To ascertain whether it is common to read of destruc\ntion of pictures by fire, I looked carefully at the notices of\nfires in the Times during the rest of the year, and only found\none other case, in December, where mention was made of the\ndestruction by fire of pictures.\nWhether or not there is a connexion between the fire at\nGlasgow at 1.20 a.m. and the record of a recent fire in my\nscript eleven hours later, there is, I am inclined to think, a\nconnexion between my script and the unusual sensation of\nsubdued excitement which preceded it by about three hours.\nIt is probable that the first impression\u2014however produced\u2014\nof a fire reached my consciousness about 10 a.m., but was not\ndefinite enough to emerge till later in the morning.\n(12) On December 7th, 1903, in the train on my way back\nfrom London, where I had spent the day, about 11 p.m. the\nscript wrote :\nThe letter is at your house that explains. good guid\nance.2 and the waters of Omar.\nThere was no letter for me at home, but the first post next\nmorning brought me a letter from my friend Mrs. Leaf\n1 Sir Oliver Lodge, with whom I communicated, wrote to the\nsecretary of the Club for information about details not contained\nin a paragraph from the Glasgow Herald of May 28th.\n2 The spacing represents larger writing in the original.\n\f286 Chapter XII.

I noted these at the time, but I made no further\nacquaintance with Macrobius till the spring of 1903, when the\nappearance in the script of allusions, as it seemed, to Neo-\nPlatonic theories, induced me to read for the first time several\nof the later Platonists, among others Macrobius. On reading\nMacrobius I found some further traces of apparent connexion\nwith rny script, and I here group together all the indications\nof such connexion. In some cases the phrases in the script\nmay easily he traced to other sources, but as bearing on the\ngeneral question of connexion between Macrobius or other\nNeo-Platonists and the script, it seems better to place them\ntogether for comment.\n(a) Macrobius' longest work is called the Saturnalia, and\nrepresents a supposed conversation on things in general\nbetween friends assembled during that festival. Catullus'\nphrase for the Saturnalia, ' optima dierum,' is naturally enough\nquoted by Macrobius.1 The same phrase occurs twice in my\nscript.2 The question of what is there intended has been dis\ncussed above. The phrase, in any case, probably has its origin\nin the familiar passage of Catullus.\n(6) On May 3rd, 1901, the script uses the phrase crastino\ndie, and on May 31st, 1901, it speaks of deferring in cras-\ntinum diem. On October 17th, 1901, it shows some uncertainty\n1Sat. II. 1. 8. 2 March 15th, April 3rd, 1901, see p. 50.\n\fLin.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 287\nas to the phraseology used, and speaks of telling more eras\nvel crastino die. The doubt as to the best phrase to use for\n\" to-morrow \" amused me when I saw it, but recalled nothing.\nMacrobius discusses at some length1 the question whether the\nphrase die crastini is justifiable, or whether the more regular\ndie crastino is not preferable. Though the disputed linguistic\npoint is not quite the same in the script and in Macrobius,\nthere is a close analogy between them. I know no other\nplace where the phrase is discussed, and, as such discussions\ndo not interest my normal self, I have no explanation to give\nfor their occurrence in the script.\n(c) Several of the quotations from Virgil in the script are\nalso quoted by Macrobius. But his quotations from Virgil\nare so numerous that the coincidence goes for little or\nnothing, especially as the quotations common to both are very\nfamiliar.\n(dlj) On October 12th, 1904, in an imaginary journey to\nthe Abode of the Blest, the script says that the \" way must\nbe sought for thrice and four times,\" ter et quater renovare\nviam. Seven is of course a mystic number, but I had no\nassociations with the division of it into three and four. Virgil\n(jEneid I. 94) has the phrase terque quaterque beati, \" thrice\nand four times blest,\" applied to those who have not lived to\nsee the destruction of Troy, and the words in the script may\nbe due to a reminiscence of that passage or some other similar\nuse of the words. But Macrobius quotes the Virgilian phrase\nto illustrate his contention that Virgil was deeply learned\nin ritual and mystic lore,2 and supposes it to describe the\nhappiness of the Blest. The numbers three and four and\ntheir resulting conjunction into seven have a special significance\nin the Pythagorean system\u2014a system intimately connected\nwith later Neo-Platonic symbolism. The importance of the\nPythagorean Siarecrcrdpiav is insisted upon in the same passage\nof Macrobius. I knew nothing of the Pythagorean Diatessaron,\nand could see no possible meaning for a phrase in my script of\nDecember 19th, 1902, \"the new and old Diatessaron,\" till I read\n1Sat. I. 4.\n2\"Nullius disciplinae expers plene et per omnia beatos exprimere\nvolens.\" Macr. Comm. in Somn. Scip. I. 6. 44. See also above, p. 131.\n\f288 Chapter XII. [PAST\nthe passage in Macrobius early in 1905.1 The only application\nthat I could find for the word Diatessaron was to the com\nbined narrative of the four Gospels, but that did not explain\nthe double reference (\"new and old\"), which became intelligible\nonly when I learnt that there was a Pythagorean as well\nas a Christian Diatessaron.\n(e) The script's habit of punning described above finds its\nanalogy in Macrobius, but is common enough in other classical\nwriters, and especially among the Neo-Platonists. Once, how\never, the same unscientific and fanciful connexion between two\nunconnected words appears both in Macrobius and the script.\nMacrobius 2 connects Apollo's epithet, Delphian, with a supposed\nold Greek word <5eX$o? meaning \" one,\" and goes on to say that\nhence too comes the word aSe\\<j>6s \"brother,\" as meaning \"not\none.\" The script connects together the words a<5eA0o? \" brother,\"\nand <5eX0iKo'j \" Delphian \" in the phrase a\u00a7e\\<j>os Se\\<piKrj o\/u.<ptl\nXpfoeTai, and makes quite clear that the reference is to the\nDelphian Apollo by going on to suggest that by attention and\nthe dismissal of one's own imagination one may arrive at an\ninterpretation of the truth of God.3\n(\/) Another allusion to Macrobius perhaps occurs on April\n27th, 1901, when the script wrote as follows: \"Commensal in\nnitidillo cecinit carmen irrefragabile scientiae. nonne audis 1\nausculta aures adhibeto iam pooemium incipit. Fac, Die, faceto\ndicto. nomen nescis\u2014sed non semper sic erit.\" The actual\nwords are obscure and not easily translatable, but the general\nsense is plain. Some one somewhere has repeated \" an irre\nfutable formula of wisdom \" ; if I do not hear I am to listen\nand attend, for the prelude (?) begins at once. Then follow the\nwords Fac Die faceto dicto, intended apparently for a pun on\nthe word faceto.\nThe same combination of words is found in Macrobius. He\nis explaining that the ancients called seemly jests \"dicta\"\n1 The text of Macrobius was in my possession, and had been\nreferred to, though not read, before the script of October 12th, 1904,\nso that I may have seen, without remembering, his comment on the\nVirgilian phrase terque quaterque. But the allusion in the script to\nthe \"Diatessaron\" occurred some months before I had any oppor\ntunity of acquaintance with Macrobius.\n2 Sat.

The script was obtained on\nApril 27th, 1901,2 when I knew nothing of Macrobius. It\nwas only in February, 1905, that., in the course of a careful\nreading of the whole of Macrobius, I came across the passage\nin question.\n(g) On April 20th, 1901, the script attaches some importance\nto the solstice,3 which, it says, is to be awaited. There is\na more definite reference on June 23rd, 1901. I note the\nallusions, as they may be a reflexion on the general interest\nin the solstice felt by the Neo-Platonists. In that case they\nmay be closely connected with the incident next to be narrated.\n(h) The explanation of a phrase in the script of April 22nd,\n1901, is perhaps to be found rather in Neo-Platonic philosophy\nin general than in Macrobius in particular. The phrase is\n\" Cardo KapKivov,\" and after these mysterious words the script\ngoes on to say that if this is not possible, another4 is to be\ntried and hope not abandoned. The two words had no\nmeaning or connexion as far as I could see. Cardo means a\nhinge, and is also used of the four cardinal points ; icdpKivos\nmeans a crab. But I learn to my surprise from Macrobius and\nother writers that the phrase has a traditional meaning, so\nthat the combination is intelligible and probably not accidental.\nBasing his views on the Platonic myth at the end of the\nRepublic, Porphyry,6 in his allegorical interpretation of Homer,\n1 Cic. 24 fragm.

The northern gate\nis the one by which the souls enter in their descent to earth.1\nThe words used for the gates by Porphyry are a\/cpa and Trv\\ai,\nand the northern gate is called 6 KapKivos and KOTO. Kapicivov.\nCardo is not used in the singular for a door, but it is used for\none of the cardinal points (aicpov), so that the phrase Cardo\ncanceris would naturally represent the north point on the\necliptic, in the sign of Cancer the Crab, which served for the\nentrance gate of the descending souls. KdpKivos is precisely\nequivalent to cancer, so that the phrase \"Cardo KapKivov\"\nthough combining two languages and not occurring anywhere\nin the classics, is perfectly intelligible. But it was not\nintelligible to me at the time of writing nor for some years\nlater.\n(i) It is possible to see in the description2 on January 20th,\n1903, some connexion with the Cave of the Nymphs, as\nallegorically interpreted by Porphyry from Homer's account in\nOdyssey, XIII. 97.\nThe scribe appeared to think the description veridical, but it\nrecalled nothing to me. Some six weeks later, however, having\noccasion to consult a Biographical Dictionary for the life of\nPorphyry, who was little more than a name to me, I found\nthere an -account of his allegory of the Cave of the Nymphs\nwhich seemed to have some points in common with my script,\nand I then read Porphyry's work for the first time. Porphyry's\nCave is inhabited by Naiads\u2014water-nymphs\u2014representing the\nsouls that are to be born. In the script, Nereids, also water-\nnymphs, inhabit what is obviously intended for an Abode of\nthe Blest.

I. 12. 1-3), Apuleius,\nand elsewhere, and seem to have been common among the Neo-\nPlatonists.\n2 See above, p. 112, for comment on the series of which this script\nforms part. The point here raised is whether any connexion is to\nbe traced between this description on Jan. 20, 1903, and Porphyry's\nAllegory, then unknown to me.\n\fLIII.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 291\nmade in the script, though the \"great tree\" mentioned there\nis not defined.\nThe Homeric description on which Porphyry's allegory is\nbased contains the olive-tree and the water-nymphs, but is\nwholly without mystical suggestion, and presents no analogy\nwith the script. The connexion between Porphyry's Allegory\nand the script cannot be regarded as established, but there\nis no doubt that the account in the script suggests certain\nanalogies with Neo-Platonic or Orphic descriptions of Abodes\nof the Blest. On March 7th, 1903, immediately after my\nfinding in the Biographical Dictionary a short account of\nPorphyry's allegory, and before I read the original, the script\nwrote as follows :\nIliaco carmine responsum dedi illi quod semper postulas\u2014\nmentionem iam ante feci huius loci\u2014cur non invenire potes ?\nd\/cri) Kvaveri\u2014mare glaucum spumantibus equis insuper deus vehitur\u2014\nnihilo magis rota magistri tempus in partes aequas dividit.\nprime splendidior, postremo multisonans voce angelica, postea autem\nvotjTip re Kal voipu> magis uteris.

This was known to me, and\nhad been recalled by the statement in the book of reference.\nIn this point then the script showed ignorance of what\nwas familiar to me. But two other points appear to show\n* Trans. \" In the Ilian (?) poem I have given the answer to that\nwhich you constantly ask.

(mental)\nwas quite unfamiliar to me, but when later I read Porphyry I\nfound that the word was common in his vocabulary. Further,\nthe introduction of the mysterious \" wheel of the master \"\ndividing time, conveyed no association or suggestion to me\ntill, a year or two later, I read an account of a series of\ninscribed Orphic tablets found in Lower Italy.1 I then found,\nwhat I certainly did not know before, that the wheel is of\ngreat importance in Orphic ritual. In the allusions to the\nAbode of the Blest in these Orphic tablets there appear\nwater-nymphs and springs, a tall cypress tree, and a wheel.\nI have found no parallel to the phrase \" wheel of the master,\"\nthe Orphic prayers being addressed to the Mistress of the\nUnderworld.2 The allusion in the .script, it is true, lacks\nprecision, but the correspondence in phraseology and idea\nbetween these Orphic descriptions and my script surprises\nand puzzles. At the time they were produced I was com\npletely unacquainted with the later Greek philosophers and\nmystics. My knowledge was confined to the allusions in\nMr. Myers' Essay on the Greek Oracles,3 but there is\nnothing whatever in that suggestive of these fanciful accounts\nof abodes of the Blest. I have never investigated this\nor any kindred subject, or taken any interest in Greek\nmysticism. There was no text of Plotinus, Porphyry, larnbli-\nchus, or any writer on similar subjects in our house, till I\nwas induced to read such authors by the allusions in my\nscript. Miss Harrison was in Italy examining the Orphic\ntablets in March and April, 1903, and after her return to\nCambridge I probably heard something of their contents,\nthough my conscious knowledge of them dates only from the\npublication of her book in the autumn of 1903. Nor have\nI been able to find in such classical authors as I have read\nanything about the underworld which would have suggested the\nsort of symbolism which appears in the script.\n1 Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, by Miss J.

Ask about this.\nThe last phrase suggested that the statement was verifiable,\nbut it was not obvious where the corroboration was to be\nfound. It was not till later that my reading of Neo-Platonic\nwriters showed me that it was a regular instruction of the\nthaumaturgists to persons wishing to attain mystical communion\nto make their efforts only when the wind was from the West.\nI cannot conceive why my script should agree with them.\n(14) Two hills in Rome have been mentioned by name in\nthe script. On July 30th, 1901, I was told that the Caelian\nhill had already appeared in the script before this date, and\nthat this was to be noted. Apparently I had \"it not quite\nright.\" I could find no earlier reference to the Caelian hill,\nbut in January, 1906, when writing this paper, I found that\na part of the Caelian hill was differently named, as Caeliolus,\nby Varro, Gaeliculus, by Cicero.1 In the script of April 24th,\n1901, in the midst of an unintelligible2 passage came the\nwords, Gaeliculosua vel alium non dissimile, and then a\nreproach for sticking over the words. The sentence quoted\nis not translatable as it stands, and contains a false concord,\nalium being masculine and dissimile neuter. It however\nsuggests that a word not unlike Caeliculosus is intended, and\nthis might well be Caeliculus. I find no other word with\nwhich it is possible to connect it. It seems therefore as if\nthis script of April 24th, 1901, might contain the earlier re\nference to the Caelian hill spoken of on July 30th, 1901.\nThe other Roman hill mentioned is not one of the famous\nseven hills, but a small eminence known as Monte Citorio.\nOn April 20th and again on June 3rd, 1901, the script\nmentions this hill, each time in connexion with a vulture.\nOn both occasions there are other mysterious allusions, and\n1 Varro, L.

The name suggested nothing whatever to\nme, but I found\u2014and I knew this before the second reference\u2014\nthat Monte Citorio1 is an artificial modern hill in Rome\nbelieved to be made from the debris of the Temple of Marcus\nAurelius. So far as I know the name was new to me when\nit occurred in the script of April 20th, 1901, and it certainly\nconveyed no association of any sort.\nIn January, 1906, I found that the only two hills in Rome\nmentioned in the script had a link of association in the same\nRoman Emperor, for Marcus Aurelius2 was, it appears, born in\na house on the Caelian3 hill.\n(15) An allusion to Columella was contained in the script\nof July 3rd, 1904, which attempted to produce a prophecy\nfor subsequent fulfilment. The prophecy is subsequently dis\ncussed ; 4 here I deal only with the reference to Columella.\nThe whole passage is quoted in the Appendix.6 The relevant\nparts are these :\nIn September remember the 19th Columella.

I only ascertained the place of\nhis birth in looking up references to the Caelian hill for the purpose\nof this paper.\n3 See Burn's Rome and the Compagna, p. 224, where the original\nauthorities are quoted.\n* See p. 327. 5See App., p. 419.\n\fLin.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 295\nabout one in three or four days. On September 19th he states\nthat the sun leaves Virgo for Libra. An alternative name\nfor Virgo is Astraea. I do not understand how my script came\nto make this combination of Astraea and September 19th, and\nto refer to Columella, who explains it. There is no other\nreference to Astraea nor to Columella iu the script.\n(16) In the last few months of 1903 1 there were repeated\n\u2022efforts in the script to give something described as a message\nfrom Dr. Sidgwick. After alluding to a sealed envelope,\napparently of Dr. Sidgwick's, the scribe wrote on September\n22nd, 1903, that before this envelope was opened another mes\nsage ought to be given correctly. This other message was stated\nto be from \" Henry Sidgwick \" ; it is not so certain to whom\nthe envelope was said to have belonged. On October 7th\nit was stated that \" Henry Sidgwick's message \" was about three\nletters kept together, and further descriptions, not very definite,\nof the letters were given. Mr. Piddington was to be told to ask\nMrs. Thompson about these envelopes.2 On October 8tb, before\nI had heard the result of these enquiries, some further points\nwere added to the description of the letters, in particular the\ndate June, 1872 (perhaps June 9th), but it was said that Mrs.\nThompson knew nothing of them.\nOn October 10th further attempts were made to give the\ncontents of a letter of June 9th, 1872,3 and it was also suggested\nthat I should ask Mrs. Sidgwick to gi,ve me a question about\nDr. Sidgwick to which she knew the answer and I did not.\nThis question I was to put \"at the first chance.\" It was\nstated that the message was not yet correctly understood.\nAnother reference to the letters on October 12th was followed\nby the words in large writing:\nIt was arranged that he should refer to these\nthree letters\nbut it does not appear who was to refer to them.\niSee App., p. 419. 2See p. 202.\n3 On October 4th, 1903, there had been a description of a pocket\n\"book containing a photograph and a paper on which was the date\nJune, 1872, and some words of which the general drift was\ngiven. Whether this is supposed to belong to the three letters I\n,cannot say.\n\f296 Chapter XII. [PART\nOn December 25th, after saying that Sidgwick's message\nwas not clear, the script went on to state that Mrs. Sidgwick\nwould know about the three letters, and on the next day,\nDecember 26th, it repeated this remark. On January 1st,\n1904, it suggested that a diary was connected with the letters,\nand on January 29th it apparently corrected earlier statements\nin the words:\nThe letters are kept by someone\u2014those we told of\u2014you have\nnot asked the right person.\nOn February 7th, 1904, I heard from Mrs Sidgwick, to whom I\nhad written, that she could make nothing of the remarks\nabout the supposed three letters. The only correct statements\nin the above attempts seem to be negative and valueless, viz. :\nthat Mrs. Thompson did not know the letters, and again, that I\nhad not asked the right person. The other statements if not\nincorrect are at least unverified and unverifiable.\n(17) In the spring of 1904 two attempts 1 were made to describe\na small book. On the first occasion, April 27th, 1904, it\nwas not clear to whom the book was supposed to belong ;\nan allusion to Faith, Hope, and Charity,-2 suggested that Dr.\nSidgwick was supposed to be concerned. On May llth the\nreference to Dr. Sidgwick is plain, as several sentences in the\nscript referring to the book are in a handwriting resembling\nhis.3 This book, if opened at a particular place, is said ta\ncontain the words wanted in answer,\u2014obviously, that is, in\nanswer to the question suggested by Mrs. Sidgwick, which I\nwas to put and did put as a preliminary test. The question\nwas one to which the answer might very well be contained\nin a quotation from a book. It was to find \"the last of Dr.\nSidgwick's texts.\" The script suggests that the text required\nis or is closely connected with the text in 1 Corinthians xiii.\n13. It refers to a passage in the De Imitatione concerning-\nLove, and concludes with the statement, clearly intended as an\nanswer to Mrs. Sidgwick's question, that the text alluded to\nwas the last, that there were three in all, and that one was a\nverse from Coriolanus.\n!See App., p. 421. 2See below, No. 18.\n3 For the circumstances under which this writing was produced\nsee above, p. 26.\n\fLIII.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 297\nSo far as I have been able to ascertain, there is no truth\nin any of these statements. The text in question is not\n1 Corinthians xiii. 13, and the book has not been identified.1\n(18) Closely connected with the last two episodes, and cer\ntainly associated with Dr. Sidgwick, are a series of references2\nto Faith, Hope and Charity,3 in which special value is attached\nto the virtue of Hope. It is not clear from the script what is\nthe intention of these passages, and it is possible that they aim\nat describing the contents of a sealed envelope left by Dr. Sidg\nwick. Again, it is possible that their origin is to be found in\nthe guessing of the subliminal self, started by the suggestion*\nthat a text was wanted. This I heard from Mrs. Sidgwick on\nOctober 18th, 1903, and on October 19th the script had the first\nof a long series of allusions to Faith, Hope, and Charity, and\ntheir comparative merits.\nThree of the nine references to Hope are in fragmentary\nEnglish verse, and of these the second deserves notice among\ncomments on possibly verifiable matter contained in the script.\nOn December 25th, 1903, the scribe stated that \"on the 17th\nof next month\" I was to \"ask the question,\" and a reference,\nclosely following, to \" Sidgwick's message \" made it clear that\nthe question meant was the one about \" the last of Dr. Sidg\nwick's texts \" suggested to me by Mrs. Sidgwick two months\nbefore. On January 17th, 1904, remarks about S, a letter, an\nenvelope, a seal, and the words \" not without hope,\" were\nfollowed by the statement \"The question is now answered,\"\nand later, by the following :\nThe text [or test] and the answer are one and are given\u2014Hope\u2014\nyoungest daughter of to-day, and oldest mother of the race.\nTo see the Godhead face to face, no Beholds the Godhead's very\nface.

To the best of my recollection I had not read this\npoem till my attention was attracted to it by a reference in a\nletter of Dr. Sidgwick's which I read in the Memoir, immedi\nately after its publication in March, 1906. In that letter2 Dr.\nSidgwick, writing of \" the great question of Immortality,\"\n,expresses his agreement with the line of thought \"in which\nBrowning's poem on the subject (La Saisiaz) concludes. It is\nthat on moral grounds hope rather [than] certainty is fit for\nus in this earthly existence.\"\nReaders of the poem will remember the circumstances of its\nproduction : after the sudden death of a friend, the poet takes\nalone the walk which they had planned to take together, and\ndebating with himself the question of Immortality, concludes\nas above described. Some expressions in the poem bear a\ncertain resemblance to phrases in the script\u2014' my pilgrim-foot\/\n' the ways we walked together,' ' wander at will . . . wandering\nstill'\u2014and the whole poem may not unfairly be described as\nan account of the vision of hope which comes to the wanderer\n,on a pilgrimage of affection.\nThe combination of a pilgrimage or wandering and a vision\nof Hope in the script and in the poem may, in spite of my\nimpression to the contrary, be due to a latent knowledge of the\npoem or of some notice of it. But the association of those ideas\nwith Dr. Sidgwick's name in what purports to be an attempt\nto produce a verifiable \"message\" cannot be so explained. It\nwas impossible that I should have any normal knowledge of\nthe contents of a letter written in 1878 by Dr. Sidgwick to a\nfriend with whom I was not acquainted, and I certainly did not\nsee the proofs of the Memoir.\n1 See above, p. 66, where I have left unaltered the note written in\n1905, before any possible explanation had occurred to me.\n2 Henry Sidgwick: a Memoir, p. 338.\n\fLiu.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 299\n(19) It was on February 10th, 1903, that the appearance\nof Mr. Myers' book on Human Personality justified the state\nments in the script that a certain passage from the Sym\nposium would be quoted in that book.1 Two days later, on\nFebruary 12th, the script began a series of allusions to a\nlocked box, to the position of the key of that box, and to\nsomething sealed contained by the box. Between February\n12th and April 17th there were seven references to this sub\nject. 2 They were fairly consistent, and represented that a\nletter or envelope, sealed with a four-lettered inscription on\nthe seal, was kept in a locked box. The key of this box\nwas said to be in the locked drawer of a writing table. On\nthe first occasion, February 12th, Dr. Hodgson's name was\nmentioned as likely to help; and he was indirectly referred to\non the last occasion, April 17th.\nAfter some months' interval, on August 18th, 1903, another\nreference was made to the box, and this time it was plainly\nstated that before opening the box Dr. Hodgson must receive\na message about it, and that part of a word required, but not all,\nhad been sent to him. Attempts were made at the required\nword. The script also stated plainly what had been suggested\non March 26th, that the \" message inside \" 3 was from the\nSymposium, the passage known to me.\nPutting, together the results of these eight references, I\nsupposed the script to be attempting to describe the contents\nof a sealed envelope, that is, of an envelope left sealed for\nposthumous reading. I wrote to Dr. Hodgson on August 24th,\ntelling him of the description of the box, and in his reply\n(dated September 17th, 1903), he told me that he knew\nnothing of any box like that described, and had no sealed\nenvelope left with him for posthumous reading.\nA year later, however, two more references were made by\nthe script to a box said to contain a sealed envelope enclosed\nin another envelope. On July 13th, 1904, it was stated clearly\nthat a sealed envelope left by Mr. Myers with Sir Oliver\n1 See below, No. 24. 2 See App., p. 423.\n3 i.e. inside the box. There being no reference on this occasion to\na seal or a double enclosure, the only possible meaning for \" inside \"\nis inside the box described.\n\f300 Chapter XII. [PART\nLodge, and containing a particular passage from the Symposium,\nwas kept in a box as described. This proved completely\nuntrue.1\nOn July loth, 1904,2 the script distinctly implied, if it did\nnot actually state, that Dr. Hodgson had a sealed envelope\nfor posthumous use. Referring to the opening of such an\nenvelope belonging to Sir Oliver Lodge, the scribe wrote that\nit was important for Dr. Hodgson to see the box opened, but\nthat \"his own envelope\" might wait. It is to be remem\nbered that at this time I myself knew that Dr. Hodgson had\nno sealed envelope for posthumous use. This is a noticeable but\nnot a solitary case in which the statements of the script are not\nguided by my conscious knowledge, but actually opposed to it.\n(20) At the risk of repetition, I treat separately the attempts\nto read the contents of a sealed envelope. There is some con\nfusion, as the script appears to refer to more than one sealed\nenvelope. Thus on September 22nd, 1903,3 after speaking of a\nmessage from Dr. Sidgwick, the script referred to an envelope\ncontaining a drawing on one side of the paper and a word or\ntwo on the other. Attempts made to represent the words were\nrecognised as unsuccessful; the drawing, called a curved line,\nresembled a 2, and it was stated\n21-y\/*a stands for Sidgwick elsewhere,4 why not there too?\nIt was not said whose envelope was described, but the im\nplication is plainly that it was Dr. Sidgwick's. No further\nreference was made to the subject till on July 3rd, 1904, the\nscript wrote as follows, about the contents of an envelope, plainly\nnot the one referred to on September 22nd, 1 903 :\nWhat is now wanted is a fulfilled prophecy to induce you to\nopen the envelope which contains the allusion to Plato, and the place\nof Love in the scheme.\nIt then proceeded to try to make such a prophecy.6\n!See below, No. 20. 2 Perhaps also on July 18.

The description which\nit proceeded to give of the appearance of the envelope was\ntoo indefinite to be valuable. The envelope was said to\nhave been placed in another envelope, which was initialed\nand dated, not by the writer, and the containing envelope\nhad been placed with other papers in a box. I knew that Sir\nOliver Lodge had sent his sealed envelope for custody to\na bank, so that there was nothing of evidential value in\nthis description. The same script referred also to the contents\nof an envelope left by Dr. Sidgwick with Mrs. Sidgwick, and\nsaid to be kept with two other letters.2 On July 18th, 1904,\nthe script pressed that its statements should be tested, and\nrepeated that the passage from the Symposium was in a\nsealed envelope, but not in Dr. Hodgson's envelope.3 On\nAugust 14th the script repeated its view of the contents of\nthis envelope, and\u2014much less definitely 4\u2014of those of Dr.\nSidgwick's envelope mentioned on July 13th, and again ex\npressed a wish for the experiment to be made. On November\n25th, 1904, during the experiment suggested by Mr. Constable,6\nit again expressed a wish to have the envelope opened.\nThe experiment was tried, as described in the S.P.R. Journal\nfor January, 1905, and proved a complete failure. There was\nno reference in the envelope to the passage in the Symposium,\nnor was there any 2 either in or on the envelope.\n(21) The next incident concerns an attempt to describe a\nring and cross belonging to the late Archbishop of Canterbury,\nDr. Benson. The articles were certainly not known to me. The\n1 See above, No. 19.\n2 Here there is possibly a connexion indicated with the supposed\nmessage of Dr. Sidgwick about three letters; see above, No. 16.\n3 For my own knowledge that Dr. Hodgson had no such envelope,\nsee above, No. 19.\n4 The envelopes were said to contain, one a reference to Love, the\nother to Hope. The reference to Love was plainly an allusion to the\npassage from the Symposium, but the reference to Hope was too in-\n-definite for identification.\n6 See above, p. 171.\n\f302 Chapter XII. [PART\nquestion whether the description is definite enough to be\nof evidential value is for the reader to answer. The incident\nis complicated, and cannot be briefly stated.\nOn January 31st, 1902, appeared a first reference to a bishop's\nring, in the words:\na\/iiVySovrj\u2014os* <rfavSovrj Wvovi Socris yavvfj.evy Krjpl no that is\nnot right. He was glad to get the ring\u2014a bishop's ring.\nOn May 31st, 1902, just before I went abroad, the script\nhad: \"Later not here in the mountains shall come the news\nthat helps.\" Then, after some illegible and unintelligible words,\nit suggested that I should dream and remember, and concluded :\n\" amerysthine ameranth amethystine\u2014 one of those words, for\nyou for you only.\"\nFor some days, I made no further attempts at writing, as\nI felt as if the faculty had left me.1 A sensation of returning\nfaculty on the night of June 20th was followed by an impulse\nto write on June 21st, at the Riffel Alp, \" in the mountains.\"\nAfter a reference to an Essay which my husband was writing\nat the time, the script concluded with a signature as follows :\netc EtC\n^ \"JVC n\u00b0\u2014 not quite right. ^ j^ .\nI showed this to my husband on June 23rd, and to him the\ninitials which we read as ETC, or EVC (meaningless to me),\nsuggested incorrect combinations of those of Dr. Benson, EWT\n(as Bishop of Truro), EWC (as Archbishop of Canterbury). He\nsaid he had been thinking much of the Archbishop since we\nhad been at the Riffel Alp.\nOn June 24th, quite unexpectedly, at 9.45 a.m., when I was\ndressing to go out, I had a strong impulse to write, and the\nscript produced attempts at the letter E, followed by an\naccount of an amethyst ring of a shape described.2 A cross\nwas also described and drawn : the arms and head terminated\nin trefoils, and in the centre of each trefoil there was a jewel.\n* Trans. apvySovrj is meaningless ; the next words mean \" the ring,\nthe gift of a nation (or tribe), with joyful heart.\"\n1 See above, p. 154.\n2 For reproduction of drawings and complete script, see App., p. 425\n\fLin.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 303\nThere was no jewel, though there was some decoration indicated,\nat the intersection of the arms. It was said that my husband\nwould know, and I was told to write again that evening.\nOn the same day, at 9.40 p.m., a further description was given\nof the ring. The carved stone was held by a gold rim, ogive-\nshaped, and the circlet of the ring was said to bifurcate to\nhold the stone. The ring was further said to have something\ninscribed upon it, three letters that looked like Hebrew, in\nthe length of the ring. It was again repeated that these state\nments could be verified, and that the incident was evidential.\nOn June 27th, 1902, a little gold chain was described, but\non July 1st it was said that this chain had nothing to do with\nthe cross, \" the cross stands is not worn\" ; this statement was\nsigned E.T.C. On July 7th, 1902, it was said that the ring\nwas quite right, though the letters might not be correct, and\na further attempt at those letters was made. Then came a\ndrawing of the upper part of a cross, undecorated, but surrounded\nat the intersection with a circle, and the script added :\nThis is on the tomb but the other cross is lighter in design\u2014and\nhas something glistening about it besides the gems in the trefoils,\nTrifoliata gemmata stellata * I have tried to give those three points\nbefore this but you have not understood.\nI showed both writings of June 24th to my husband on the\n25th, and he said that he remembered an amethyst ring\nbelonging to the Archbishop of the shape drawn\u2014a double\nogive\u2014but he knew nothing of any carving or inscription,\nnor of any cross belonging to the Archbishop. I had no\nrecollection of any such ring or cross. I wrote to Mrs.\nSidgwick, asking her to obtain information if she could about\na ring and cross belonging to Dr. Benson, and on my return\nto England I received from her drawings of two rings and a\ncross which had belonged to him, and are now at Truro.\n(1) The cross terminates in trefoils, in the centre of which\nis an amethyst surrounded by three pearls, and the intersection\nof the arms is surrounded by a circle, in the centre of which\nis an amethyst. This cross was very seldom worn by the\nArchbishop.\n* Trans. \" Three leaved, jewelled, starred.\"\n\f304 Chapter XII. [PART\n(2) There is a sapphire ring engraved with the arms\nof the see of Canterbury ; the stone is oval or nearly round,\nheld in a solid gold setting, wider than the stone, and in no\nway resembles the drawing or description in the script. This\nring Dr. Benson had as Archbishop of Canterbury.\n(8) There is an amethyst ring of double ogive shape ; the\namethyst is held by a solid gold setting, not so deep as the stone.1\nThe amethyst is cut, and there is an inscription on the ring,\nas follows: +EWB 1877 FRATKUM NN PIETAS ET DESIDERIUM.\nThis ring Dr. Benson had as Bishop of Truro, and this ring was\nthe one which my husband remembered. He had, and has, no\nrecollection of the other ring, though he must have seen it.\nHe had no knowledge of any inscription on the amethyst\nring. I never met Dr. Benson till he was Archbishop of\nCanterbury, and I have never been to Truro, so that it may\nbe taken as certain that I never saw the amethyst ring.2\nThe description in the script is hardly definite enough for\nidentification with the ring and cross belonging to Dr. Benson,\nand, moreover, is not correct in all points. The cross does,\nit is true, terminate in trefoils, in the centre of each of which\nis a jewel; the intersection of the arms is surrounded by a\ncircle ; and there are other jewels on the cross besides the gems\nin the trefoils ; but there is a jewel in the centre, where the\nscript stated that there was none. The cross may be described\nas trifoliata and gemmata, but the third word, stellata, seems\nto have no application.\nWith regard to the ring, it is true that Dr. Benson had\nan amethyst ring, that the stone was of the shape described,\nthat the stone was cut (if that is what is meant by \" carved \"\nin the script of June 24), and that there was an inscription\nupon the ring. The final drawing of the ring (June 24th) is\nnot unlike the actual ring; but if the statement that the\n\" circlet of the ring bifurcates to hold the stone \" means that\n1 In this ring the stone projects above and below the gold set\nting ; in the sapphire ring, the stone is completely within the setting.\n2 I noted that \" I seem to recollect Dr. Benson's wearing a massive\nring with arms upon it, but I cannot be sure.\" This was probably\nthe sapphire ring. No memory whatever was recalled by the\ndescriptions of the script, nor by the drawings of the amethyst ring.\n\fLIII.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 305\nthe gold setting is divided on each side of the stone into\ntwo branches, the description is incorrect. The letters in the\ninscription are not three nor do they look like Hebrew.\nI have no explanation for the first word in the phrase of\nJanuary 31st, eOvovs Socris, \" gift of a nation,\" but the actual\ninscription on the amethyst ring suggests that the words \"he\nwas glad to get the ring, a Bishop's ring,\" are appropriately\napplied to that ring, received from friends on his appointment\nto a Bishopric.1 The script of January 31st seems to show\u2014\nsupposing that the whole thing is not accidental\u2014that the\nappearance of the ring and cross is not solely due- to the\ndirection of my husband's thoughts or mine during our stay\nat the Riffel Alp. Whatever explanation is given of the script\nof June and July, 1902, must extend to that of January 31st,\n1902.\n(22) On March 27th, 1901, quite in the early days of\nthe script, a piece of unintelligible writing was signed as\nfollows :\nTuus denique nomen adposui. interpretatio tua nunc.\nI could make nothing of this signature, but when my\nhusband saw it on the same day he suggested that it was\na reversed and double monogram of E.G., Mr. Gurney's initials,\nbut neither he nor I could make anything of the three marks\nround the G., which we took to be decorative.\n1 With a view to ascertaining whether the description in the script\nmight fit the ring and cross worn by any Bishop, and so have no\nconnexion with Dr. Benson, I looked carefully on August 10th and\n14th, 1902, at a portrait of Dr. Creighton which is at Newnham\nCollege. In that portrait he wears a cross and two rings, but none\nof these objects bears any resemblance to those described in the\nscript. Neither of the rings is ogive-shaped, one of them having\ntwo large stones visible, and probably a third, while the stone of\nthe other ring is oval or circular. The cross does not terminate in\ntrefoils.\nu\n\f306 Chapter XII. [PART\nOn June 30th, 1901, the communication about a lost MS.\nplay,Jdescribed above,1 was preceded and followed by remarks\nintended jto suggest that the communicator had been introduced\nand succeeded by Mr. Gurney, thus : \" G v r v ey. He cannot\nspeak\u2014will^write a word\u2014 wait,\" then: \"He has done what\nhe can. this is another thing EGy.\"\nThere was no doubt as to the person intended ; the interest\nlies in ^the curious abbreviation of the surname, Gy. Neither\nmy husband nor I had any reason to attribute such an\nabbreviation to Mr. Gurney, and we regarded it as a pure\npiece of fancy.\nIn April, 1902, on my way to stay with Mrs. Forbes for\nthe first*time, I had a sudden desire to write automatically. The\nfirst words written (April 14th) were : \" Mrs. Forbes has got\nit\u2014for you in the house.\" 2 There were no letters waiting\nfor me, and I thought no more of the message. On April 15th\nMrs. Forbes and I tried Planchette together, and in the early\nafternoon, after a .remark in looking-glass writing about my\ndesire for more evidence, followed in ordinary writing by the\nwords, \" Edmund only wants to prove the reality of life,\" we\ntook a fresh start and Planchette wrote :\nWe read the first scribble as a carelessly written \" Guy,\"\nand wondered if this had been suggested by the name of a\ndog in the house ; of the second we could make nothing ;\nthe third was written while we were discussing the meaning\nof the first two. Mrs. Forbes commented on the occurrence\nof the surname Gurney, as the Christian name Edmund was\ncommonly used in her automatic writing. At the conclusion\nof the Planchette, writing, in answer to a request of Mrs. Forbes,\nthree signatures were given. It appeared that there was a\nslight general resemblance between the Planchette-signature\nand the genuine signatures of Talbot Forbes (writing not\nknown to me but familiar to Mrs. Forbes), and H. (writing\n1See p. 279. 2 For rest of writing, see above, p. 186.\n\fLIII.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 307\nknown to us both). Mrs. Forbes thought it would be\ninteresting to see if there were any likeness in the third\nsignature, purporting to be Mr. Gurney's, and fetched a letter of\nMr. Gurney's for the purpose of comparison. This letter had\nbeen given to her \" for test purposes \" by H., to whom it was\noriginally addressed. Mrs. Forbes had known Mr. Gurney, but\nhad preserved no letters from him. No use had been made\nby her of this letter since she received it.\nThe letter was signed EGy. On seeing this we looked back\nat the earlier Planchette signature and read the first mark as\nEGy, with a superfluous stroke between the G and y, while\nthe second, on turning the sheet half round, was plainly seen\nto be EGy. I then remembered that the same abbreviation\nhad occurred in my script, and verified this recollection on my\nreturn to Cambridge.1 I also found the earlier monogram of\nMarch 27th, 1901, and recognised that the three marks, then\nunexplained, have the form of y.\nI have made enquiries among Mr. Gurney's friends, but have\nnot heard of any other occasion on which this abbreviated form\nof signature was used. The Planchette-signature may obviously\nrepresent the emergence of Mrs. Forbes' forgotten knowledge, for\nshe had read the letter which she used for comparison, though\nshe had no recollection of anything peculiar in the signature,\nand commented on it with surprise when I drew her attention\nto it. But the occurrence of the abbreviation in my script in\nJune, 1901, and possibly in March, 1901, cannot be thus explained.\nI certainly had no conscious knowledge, and do not see how\nI could have had any knowledge, or any reason for supposing\nthat Mr. Gurney had ever used this abbreviation ; nor can I\nexplain why my script attributed it to him. It is proper in\nthis connexion to note (1) that the letter had been given to\nMrs. Forbes for test-purposes, and (2) that the discovery of\nthe signature certainly justified (to me) the statement of my\nscript that Mrs. Forbes had \" got it for \" me \" in the house.\"\n(23) On August 18th, 1903, the scribe told me to send Dr.\nHodgson a name represented by Orinaria or Orellaria, anyhow\n1 Before doing so I wrote from Mrs. Forbes' house to Sir Oliver\nLodge relating the incident.\n\f308 Chapter XII. [PART\nending in ia, and later appearing as Oriana, Oronia, Auronia,\nOroria (or Orona). On September 9th, 1903, after the production\nof a statement unknown to me, but subsequently found to be\ntrue, the script made several attempts at a word or words. The\nleading ideas in its first paragraph are a long word beginning\nwith C, a crown, and a star ; in the second, Camilla, yellow hair,\nthe constellation of Ariadne's crown, and the two words Oritella\nCoronata. In this script there was indirect but unmistakeable\nreference to Dr. Hodgson.\nOn September 17th, 1903, the script connected the statement\nthat I had now got the key-word with Dr. Hodgson's name,\nand on October 5th it recurred to attempts at a word. An\nallusion to Catullus' poem of Ariadne introduced the statement\nthat there was an omen and a name in the words Ariadne stella\ncoronaria, and that this was to be sent.1 Then came an allusion\nto another constellation, Berenice's hair.2 After rejecting another\nallusion to hair, the script recurred to a crown and combined\nit with the mention of flowers. Further allusions to Ariadne\nand the statement that the interpretation was easy concluded\nthis involved passage.\nI sent these attempts to Dr. Hodgson as representing an\neffort to produce something of significance to him. On\nJanuary 20th, 1904, I heard from Dr. Hodgson in reply. He\nwrote that he had had the name syringa in his mind in\nconnexion with the phrase in my script about \" lilia olympiaca\nnon Romana \" (October 5th), but could trace no connexion.\nSyringa blossoms, he then added, had a special significance to\nhim, having been given some time between 1893 and 1897\ninclusive, through Mrs. Piper's trance, as a test message to be\nsent to a former sitter, now dead. The recipient of the\nmessage had more than once referred to this message as an\nexcellent test. The production of the word Syringa as a\nmessage for Dr. Hodgson in my script would therefore be\nanother good ' test,' since I was wholly unaware of Dr.\nHodgson's associations with the word.\n1 i.e. to Dr. Hodgson ; so I understood, and so I did.\n2 For detailed comment see Appendix, p. 427. The reader can\njudge thence whether I have unduly emphasised any points. To give\nreasons here would complicate the narrative.\n\fLIII.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 309\nIt occurred to Dr. Hodgson to look up syringa in his\ndictionary (the Century), where he found : \" a plant of the\ngenus Philadelphus ; the mock orange . . . the original\nplant was P. coronarius, a native of Southern Europe, etc.\"\nHe added that he had no conscious knowledge of the name\nPhiladelphus coronarius.\nOn reading this I looked back at the two passages in my\nscript. That of September 9th, 1903,1 appears to contain\nattempts to produce the word coronarius, both in sound and\nin sense, of much the same type as the attempts, in the\nautumn of 1901, to give the three words, fiovoir<o\\ov e? a<o.2\nThe word coronaria actually occurs in the script, the crown\nis unmistakeable, and the two words in rather larger writing,\nOritella coronata, perhaps represent attempts at the words\nPhiladelphus coronarius. The reference to Ariadne's crown\nseems superfluous, since the idea of crown is already con\nveyed, but an explanation is perhaps to be found in the\nscript of October 5th.\nThere the words, containing \"an omen3 and a name\" which\nI am told to \" send \" are Ariadne stella coronaria, and these\nwords are immediately followed by a reference to another\nwell-known constellation closely associated with Ariadne's\ncrown, namely Berenice's hair. I do not think that Dr.\nHodgson had seen\u2014what occurred at once to me after hearing\nfrom him\u2014that the introduction of Berenice was accounted\nfor, if what was wanted was not only coronarius but Phila\ndelphus*\nCombining the scripts of Sept. 9, and Oct. 5, 1903, and\nremembering the attempts in 1901 to represent both the\nsound and the meaning of \/movdTrui\\ov e? aw, I am therefore\ndisposed to see (1) in Oritella coronata and the other\nsuggestions, an attempt at the words Philadelphus coro\nnarius, and (2) in the references to Ariadne, Berenice and\nthe constellations, an attempt to convey the ideas. Moreover,\nin the script of Oct. 5th, the crown is associated with\n!See App., p. 427. 2 See above, p. 156.\n3 For the use of this word in the script see above, note on p. 192.\n4 The exact relationship of Berenice to Ptolemy Philadelphus is\na matter of dispute, but the names are closely associated.\n\f310 Chapter XII. [PART\nflowers\u2014flowers unidentified, it is true, and described in the\nsingular phrase \"lilia Olympiaca non romana.\"\nWhy the botanical name Philadelphus coronarius was\nattempted rather than the word \"syringa,\" it is impossible to\nsay without- more knowledge than we possess of the conditions\ngoverning these phenomena. It is, however, hardly remarkable,\nwhere Latin is the language used, that the Latin rather than\nthe English name of the plant should appear in the script.\nThe Greek word crvpiyg (a shepherd's pipe) from which\nthe Syringa has its name, does occur once in the script, on\nFeb. 28th, 1903, where it is associated with asphodel, in the\nwords :\na-vpiyyi curcf>oSf\\y not quite right a asphodel stalked reed pipe\nI wanted to say. crvv r' a <7<\u00a3oS\u00abA<j) re <rvpiyyi, T\u00ab CKfT Kadi&rav <^Sai *\nasphodel stalks made their tuneless unsounding pipes.\nDr. Hodgson's letter suggested a search for other references\nto the syringa, with the following results :\nMay 16th, 1902:\nflorum corona mox tibi plana erit.f Ask Dr. Hodgson for the\nnews.\nTwo days later, May 18th, 1902 :\nin the woods it will he found the sweetest flower that blows\u2014\nthen you will know that I sent you this message, all in a month\nof May.\nOn November 24th, 1902 :\nYou will hear from Hodgson\u2014important he has tried the flowers\nbut without success.

For readers unacquainted with the\ndialogue I give the gist of the main passage and its context.\nWhen three or four of the guests, at the banquet which\ngives its name to the dialogue, have discoursed upon Love, it\nis the turn of Socrates. After declaring that he will not emulate\nthe impassioned encomium of Agathon, Socrates says that he\nwill repeat what he learnt from Diotima, a prophetess of\nMantinea, and begins by denying that Love is a god at all.\nLove is, says Uiotima, one of the race of spirits whose function\nit is to act as interpreters and mediators between gods and\nmen. Then follows a description of the parentage and function\nof Love and its place in the Platonic scheme of philosophy.\nIn March, 1901, when the script began, I had not read this\ndialogue. I had read several of the dialogues of Plato when I\nwas at Newnham College in the years 1878-1881, but chiefly the\nmetaphysical works. I read general commentaries and criticisms,\nand must have come across allusions to the Symposium, but I\ncertainly never read the dialogue, and had very little conscious\nknowledge of its contents. When in May, 1901, there was an\nallusion in my script to Diotima, I knew that she was the\none woman in the Platonic dialogues, and that she was intro\nduced in the Symposium. I knew that the subject of the\nspeeches in that dialogue was Love, but I had no idea\u2014at least\nno conscious recollection\u2014that there was any mention of spirits\nin the Symposium, or any room for them in the Platonic scheme\nof things. On June 1st, 1901, in consequence of the appear\nance of Diotima's name in the script on May 31st, I looked\nup the passage where she is introduced. On Nov. 26th, 1902,\nI read the immediate context in the dialogue, and between\nJan. 25th and Feb. 10th, 1903, I read the whole dialogue.\nIt was on May 31st, 1901, that the script made a first\nrecognisable and direct reference to the dialogue in the words\n\" Diotima gave the clue.\" I looked the passage up to see\nwhat Diotima said, and how far it could be described as a\n!See above, pp. 241-6, 301. 2See App., p. 414.\n\f312 Chapter XII. [PART\n\" clue.\" I noted at the time 1 what I conceived to be intended\nfor the clue, namely that she told Socrates that Love was\nneither a god nor a man, but a great spirit, and that the\nspiritual, being between God and man, had the power of inter\npreting and conveying messages from God to man and man to\nGod ; that all the intercourse and talk of God to men, whether\nsleeping or waking, is through spirits, and one of these is\nLove.\nI was struck with the appropriateness of the message in itself,\nand with the form in which it was conveyed\u2014not directly in\nwords, but by an allusion to Plato. I was certain that I\nhad never seen the passage, and therefore that no emergence\nof forgotten knowledge could account for its appearance, so\nthat the effect upon me was considerable and lasting. I\nrecognised, of course, that to persons who did not know me\nthere was no evidential value in the occurrence, as they\nwould think naturally that I had read and forgotten the\nSymposium, and unconsciously made up the message.\nIn spite of my interest no further allusion was made in the\nscript to this passage, and I had no further occasion to think\nof the dialogue till a year and a half later, when it happened\nthat the passage of the Symposium containing Diotima's view\nwas set for translation in Trinity College, as above described,2\nand read by me in the natural course of my work.\nBut before that occurred there had been in the script\nreferences, as I now think, to an earlier passage in the dialogue.\nIt was only when I read the whole work in January, 1903,\nthat I noticed a likeness between the two hexameter lines\nintroduced at the end of Agathon's panegyric of Love, and\nsome fragments that had occurred in my script. Those frag\nments had occurred between June 27th, 1901, and June 27th,\n1902.\nThe lines of Agathon (Symp., 197 C) are as follows:\n\/ULSV ev avOpanroi*}, -zreAayei <Se\nvrjve\/ULiav ave\/u.iai> KO'ITT}V VTTVOV T evl\n* Trans. \" Peace among men, calm on the sea, stillness of winds,\na resting-place and sleep in trouble.\"\n1 Script book, June 1st, 1901.

The first and last were written at the\nRiffel Alp above Zermatt, on the same day in two succeeding\nyears.

The second extract\nwas written at Winchester, and the third at home. On none\nof these occasions was there any apparent reason for my\nthinking of storms or calms.1\nThe resemblance between these extracts and Agathon's lines,\ntaken in conjunction with the reference to the later passage\nof the same Dialogue, suggests that an allusion to the Sym\nposium is intended in the script. Direct allusion to the later\npassage had been made unlikely, and in any case evidentially\nuseless, by my recognition of the appropriateness of the Diotima\nincident. If, therefore, a further attempt was to be made in\nthe script to suggest the Symposium, some new direction must\nbe sought. But the possibility must not be forgotten that,\nwhen I looked out the reference to Diotima on June 1st,\n1901, my eye may have been caught by the lines of Agathon,\nthough I had no recollection of having seen them till I read\nthem in their context in January, 1903.\n* Trans. \" Calm over all the seas and all the lands.\"\n1 The absence of corresponding weather conditions was noted at\nthe time.\n\fLin.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 315\nThe account of the next stage in these allusions to the\nSymposium has been related in the narrative of the connexion\nbetween me and Mrs. Forbes.1 Though I had fixed my mind\non the Symposium before writing on November 28th, 1902,\nthere was no reference to it in that or the next five following\nscripts. On December 19th, however, after receiving from Mrs.\nForbes what I took to be an .allusion to the dialogue in her\nscript, my script, after saying that Socrates was in her2\nwriting, had :\nIn the sealed book is the word, the message to men.\nthe new and old Diatessaron ;\nfollowed by the drawing of a book. Between December 19th\nand January 14th I received from Mrs. Forbes several attempts\nto give the words Symposium, etc. The one piece of script\nproduced by me in this period contained no reference to the\nSymposium except to express the belief that Mrs. Forbes would\nget the words wanted. In the last half of January there came\nclosely following upon one another five statements, which I\ninterpreted to mean that the passage in question was alluded\nto and emphasised in Mr. Myers' forthcoming book, Human\nPersonality. The extracts are as follows :\nJanuary 14th, 1903.\nWrite regularly\u2014there will be news for you to write next week\n\u2014good news before the month is out.3 The book will help\u2014our\nword is there contained.\nJanuary 22nd, 1903.\nIn Myers' book is a word that ought to make things plain\u2014\nread it to see\u2014not at the head of a chapter, but quoted in the\ntext\u2014it should have been\u2014and surely is.\nJanuary 23rd, 1903.\nRead the book for me.

I had corrected for\npress a slip consisting of a list of quotations for the headings\nof the Chapters,3 and had seen4 in slip-proof Chapter VI. with\nits Appendix. I had seen nothing else, and had no knowledge\nin detail of the scheme of the book. Mr. Myers had never\ntalked it over with me ; on one occasion, late in the autumn\nof 1900, he spoke to me of his view of sleep, and then said\nthat it would be found in his book. This, to the best of my\nrecollection, is the only occasion on which he ever spoke\nto me of what was to be in his book.\nI therefore had no means of knowing whether there was\nany likelihood that my script would be justified in its\nassertions, and I was very anxious to test this.\nOn Feb. 10,- as soon as I received the book, I turned to\nthe Index, and, failing to find \" Diotima,\" went on to look\nup the references under \" Love.\" The pages given are II.,\n282, for the \"Definition,\" and I., 112-115, for \"Platonic.\" It\nwill be seen that in Vol. I., pp. 112 to 113, after expressing\nhis own view that \"Love is the energy of integration, which\nmakes a Cosmos of the Sum of Things,\" Mr. Myers goes on\nto describe two views of love, which he calls respectively\nphysiological and Platonic, and quotes Plato's words, ep\/u.tjvevov\nKal 6icnrop9\/mevov, \"the Interpreter and Mediator between God\niI knew that the book was expected to appear on February 10th.\n2 On Feb. 7, 1903, when I saw Mr. Piddington in Cambridge,\nI told him that my script had made statements about what was\ncontained in Human Personality, and that I hoped to find them\nconfirmed.\n3 Hence no doubt the allusion in the script of January 22nd, 1903.\n4 I obtained these proofs in slip from Miss Johnson in the spring\nof 1901.\n\ftin.] Miscellaneous References to Past Events. 317\nand Man.\" These words begin the sentence which I regarded\nas the 'clue' referred to in my script of May 31st, 1901, as\nnoted before endeavouring to carry out the instructions\nreceived from Mrs. Forbes on Nov. 28th, 1902. On pp. 113\nto 115 Mr. Myers gives an abstract of the \"cosmical\" aspect\nof Love, as described by Plato in the Symposium, calling\nspecial attention to the fact that this utterance is placed by\nPlato in the mouth of Diotima, the prophetess. In Vol. II.,\np. 282, when Mr. Myers is summing up his views and defining\nLove as \"a kind of exalted, but unspecialised, telepathy,\" he\nrefers indirectly indeed, but none the less unmistakeably, to\nthis passage in the Symposium when he uses the phrase, \" it\n(Love) bridged the interval between spirits incarnate and\ndiscarnate.\"\nIt is, I think, beyond dispute that my script was justified\nin saying that in Mr. Myers' book was a word that would\n\"make things plain,\" and that this view of Plato's expressed\nin the Symposium was \"quoted in the text.\"1 The question\nremains whether this information was more than a happy\nguess.\nThat question will no doubt be differently answered by\ndifferent persons. For myself, I believe that I had no such\nantecedent knowledge as would have suggested such a statement.\nI took some pains at the time to investigate the question : I\nhave here stated all that I believe myself to have known\nfrom Mr. Myers or otherwise about the actual contents of\nthe forthcoming book.2 No reference to this passage or to\nDiotima is made in papers published by Mr. Myers in the\nS.P.R. Proceedings. In his essay on Rossetti (Assays, Modern,\np. 334), which I must have read before March, 1901, there is\na reference to the phrase, ep\/aujvevov KO.I SicnropOfievov, but there\nis nothing to indicate the dialogue from which the phrase is\n1 No explanation has been suggested for the words, \" To the ends\nof the earth that is the countersign.\" (Jan. 31, 1903.)\n2 The proofs of Human Personality were in Mrs. Myers' house at\nCambridge, where I was a frequent visitor during the spring and\nsummer of 1901.

[PART\ntaken, so that it is impossible for any one unacquainted with\nthe Symposium to locate the allusion. Moreover, the quota\ntion is used in a passage dealing with a different aspect of\nthe subject, and contains no suggestion of what seems to me\nthe keynote of the references in my script, viz., that com\nmunication between God and Man is effected by means of\nspirits, and that Love is a Spirit. In the essay on Rossetti,\nMr. Myers writes: \"Love, as Plato said, is the ep\/myvevov KCU\nSiaTropO\/u.evov, the 'interpreter and mediator' between things\nhuman and things divine ; and it may be to Love that we\nmust look to teach the worshipper of Beauty that the highest\nthings are also the loveliest, and that the strongest of moral\nagencies is also the most pervading and keenest joy.\" \u2022 This is\nquite different from the application made in Human Per\nsonality, and suggested in my script.1\nThe next group of allusions to the Symposium has been\ndescribed above, and may be thus summed up : 2 On August\n18th, 1903, the script stated that the passage from the Sym\nposium was inside something contained in a box about which\nI was to ask Dr. Hodgson, and on July 13th, 1904, and\nAugust 14th, 1904, this passage was said to be contained in\nan envelope which it was desirable to open. These statements\nwere not correct.\nReaders of this paper will be accustomed to failures of the\nscript, and many reasons can be found for this particular\nfailure. Possibly one such reason should be sought in the\ndifficulty of excluding the tendency to guess, of which I have\nspoken above. A phrase on December 19th, 1902, \" in the\nsealed book is the word,\" possibly intended to refer to Human\nPersonality, may have suggested to whatever faculty it is\nthat guesses that a sealed envelope was in question. But it\nis unnecessary to look very far for the source of such a guess.\nThe numerous allusions in the script to the opening of envelopes\nand similar things, show how anxious the scribe was to work\noff a success in this direction.\n1 The opinion formed at the time was expressed in my diary of\nFebruary 12th, 1903, and I have seen no reason to alter it.\n2 See p. 299-301.\n\fLIU.] Miscellaneous References to Future Events. 319\nCHAPTER XIII.\nMISCELLANEOUS REFERENCES TO FUTURE EVENTS.\nI NOW come to a group of incidents which appear to relate,\nnot to past events, but to the future\u2014an actual future, not a\npresent impression of what will be. In some cases it is stated\nin the script that these incidents are prophetic ; in other cases\nthere is nothing to show the date of the supposed incident,\nbut subsequently occurring events seem to correspond with the\nstatements of the script. In these last cases, unless the cor\nrespondence of detail is pretty close, the evidence is valueless.\nBut that the reader may judge whether prophecy, even when\nfulfilled, is due to anything more than casual coincidence, I\nhave collected together all instances in which it is possible to\nsee an attempt at prophecy. Some of the cases are absolute\nfailures ; some are probably due to the emergence of a forgotten\nmemory, recalled by a subsequent event ; others again need a\nless impressive name than prophecies, and would be better\ndescribed as anticipations.\n(1) I begin with an instance of unmistakeable intended pro\nphecy which was not completed and had no success.\nOn December 29th, 1903,1 after a fluent exordium in Latin\nurging patience and promising unique results, the scribe told\nme to write that some man was coming in a ship upon the\nsea, but not to me. I was told to note the day of writing\nand watch. The script concluded with the words :\nThis is a prophecy. I will tell you more presently, note now\nthe unexpected journey on the sea.\nI was in Algeria at the time, a fact which may account for\nallusions to journeys upon the sea. But no one known to me\narrived either there or elsewhere, as far as I could ascertain,\n1 For complete extract, see App., p. 429.\n\f320 Chapter XIII. PART\non or just after December 29th. The script did not fulfil its\nown promise of telling me more presently, and the incident\nmust be registered as a complete failure.\nThe next five incidents (2 to 6) are very slight, and it is\nmore than probable that there is no real connexion between\nthe sayings of the script and the subsequent occurrences which\nreminded me of those statements. Probably these incidents\nare of the same type as the common experience where some\nevent in the day revives the recollection of something similar\nin a dream. The difference is that in this case the dream, so\nto speak, had been previously noted, and therefore the corre\nspondence, if any, is certainly genuine, and cannot be\nattributed to false memory.\n(2) On December 9th, 1902, I went up to town for the day,\nintending to lunch at a house where I had never been before,\nand of which I knew nothing but the address, Grosvenor Road,\nWestminster Embankment. My associations with the neigh\nbourhood being entirely with Victoria Station, I started to\nfind the house at the Pimlico end.\nIn some script produced at 20 Hanover Square before 12\nnoon on that day1 occurred, apparently without any context,\nthe words :\nWhy say Milbranke what is that here ?\nThe words before and after this appeared to belong together,\nso that this sentence was quite disconnected and had neither\nmeaning nor context. On reading it over I supposed the name\nintended to be Milbanke, as Milbranke seemed an unknown\ncombination. I subsequently found that the house I visited,\nwhich we occupied later on for a month, was close to the\nsite of Milbank Penitentiary, and very near Milbank Street.\nThe connexion between the fact and the name in the script\nis of the loosest, and even if connexion be recognised it is\nlikely that the script represents some vague knowledge on\nmy own part that the house which I was to visit was\nnear Milbank Street. If so, such knowledge was completely\nlatent, but in any case, I attach no value to the incident, atid\nhave included it here merely for the sake of completeness.\n1 The script in question was out of my control before 12m.\n\fmi.] Miscellaneous References to Future Events. 321\n(3) On April 20th, 1901, the script, which was still apt to\nbe very unintelligible, wrote :\nStella caelo decernitur cur non animo? genea y\u00abv1; computa.\nnonas pone horas ; post aliquot dies\u2014vis scire quot dies ?\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 et adde insuper tres Scribere sine remissione\nsemper in provinciam.

It is crying at something, angry or terrified. It has\ntalons and a strong beak.\nThe drawing represented, very roughly, a bird with out\nspread wings and lowered head facing the spectator and\nlooking to the spectator's right.

On March 2nd\nI spoke to Miss J. E. Harrison of my impression that the\nletter might have a symbolic meaning for Neo-Platonists or\nother later Greek writers. On March 3rd she brought me a\nbook bearing on the subject.

But\nthe explanation was only partial\u2014' the thing ' only ' half\ndone '\u2014and the full ' understanding ' was not reached till some\nmonths later after considerable ' investigation.'

The regular\nsupply of papers to the hotel began on July 1st, and this\nwas the first Italian paper which I had an opportunity of\nseeing. I found in it the following statement, telegraphed from\nParis on July 1st : \" A Coursegontes [sic\\ nelle Alpi Marittime\n1'espulzione delle suore dello Spirito Santo avenne manu\nmilitari. Le suore abbandonarono il convento cantando il\nVeni Creator.\"\nI thought that the above script might refer to the expulsion\nof the Sisters named, as it described some one singing in\nexultation the Veni Creator, 'apud spiritus sanctos.'\nI wrote to Mr. Piddington on July 4th, and on July 6th\nhe answered that he would make enquiries about the incident\ndescribed in the Giornale d'ltalia. These enquiries were\nsubsequently made, and showed :\n(a) That there is no community of any kind at Coursegoules,\nin the department of Alpes-Maritimes.\n(6) That in that Department, at Juan les Pins, on the\ncoast, there was a convent of the Sisters, of the Holy Ghost,\n' filles du Saint Esprit.'\n(c) That the only convent in the Department of the Alpes-\nMaritimes which did not conform to the law, ' loi du ler juillet,\n1901,' was this convent at Juan les Pins.1\n(d~) That on June 29, 1902, the Sous Prefet of Grasse, in\nconformity with the edict of June 27th, 1902, at 8 o'clock in\nthe morning, gave notice at the Orphelinat that the Sisters\nwere to leave, and that at 12 o'clock precisely the sisters\nand orphans left the Orphelinat for the Oratory of Juan les\nPins, accompanied by the Superior of the Oratory, M. J.\nBie Etcheborne.2\n(e) That at no moment did the Sisters sing the Veni\nCreator.\nIt is clear, therefore, that if the script of June 27th refers\nto this incident at all, it refers not to the actual occurrence\nbut to the incorrect version of it which appeared in the Giornale\n1 See Ccmrier de Cannes, July 1, 1902.\n2 I have his letter from Biarritz of Aug. 10, 1902.\n\f326 Chapter XIII. [PART\nd'Italia1 of July 2nd. The script was written on June 27th,\nthe date, as I subsequently found,2 of the decree concerning\nthe unrecognised orders. It makes no mention of the locality\nwhere this occurred, or was to occur, and neither the actual\nincident nor the newspaper account offers any explanation of the\nwords inter filios Dei? The use of the past tense, when the\nevent referred to in the script has not yet occurred, is paralleled\nin other cases.4\nOn no other occasion has there heen any reference in the\nscript to the singing of any hymn, English or Latin.\n(9) In the summer of 1903, whilst I was abroad, the script\ncommitted itself to a series of prophecies, unmistakeable pro\nphecies, expressed in the future tense with definite dates,\nwithin which the fulfilment was to occur. The statements\nmade may be summarized as follows :\n(a) that three public men would die before my return to\nEngland ;\n(6) that one death would be within the week in which Tues\nday, June 9th, was contained ;\n(c) that the third death would be sudden;\n(d) that on June 24th there were two more deaths to come,\none of them unexpected ;\n(e) that on July 3rd the third death had not occurred;\n(\/) that I should see something relevant in the papers at\nBale;\n(g) that in one case there would be a public funeral.\nThe vagueness of the definition 'public men' precluded\neffectual test, but statement \/ (at all events) wast not satisfied.\n1 A letter to the editor of the Giornale, asking for further information\nabout the incident described in the paper of July 2nd, received no\nanswer.\n2 In the Gaulois of July 5th, which I read on July 7th, I found\nthe decree spoken of as ' d^cret du 27 juin ' ; this was my first\nconscious knowledge of the date of the decree, but probably I had\nseen earlier references to it under that title.\n3 The words may be a reminiscence of Job : \" when the morning\nstars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy,\" but\nthat does not explain their occurrence in this context.\n4 See specially below, p. 331, in the Marmontel incident.\n\fMiscellaneous References to Future Events. 327\n(10) On October 6th, 1903, after a remark1 about a member\n\u2022of my husband's family, the script went on :\nG-reat changes all will see in the next year, more than one\nbreach in the close family.\nThe allusion to the \" close family \" was appropriate to my\nhusband's family. Three households, those of his father and\ntwo married brothers, at Brighton, and an unmarried aunt at\nSteyning, eleven miles off, constituted his whole family. There\nhad been no breach in the family circle since the death of\nhis mother in 1893, more than ten years before this writing.\nIt is a fairly safe prophecy to suggest breaches in a family\ncontaining some old members, and the use of the term ' breach '\nis vague. But it must be admitted that the statement of the\nscript was verbally correct. On June 2nd, 1904, my husband's\naunt died, and in September, 1904, the son of his youngest\nbrother left home to establish himself in New Zealand. So\nthat \" in the next year \" there was \" more than one breach \"\nin what till then had been a singularly \"close family.\"\n(11) On July 3rd, 1904, there seems to have been a further\n.attempt to foretell one of the two incidents just referred to,\nviz., the departure of my husband's nephew for New Zealand.\nThe incident is complicated. The script of July 3rd purported\nto give a prophecy, the fulfilment of which was to induce us\nto open the sealed envelope containing the allusion to the\nSymposium.2 The script stated that some one would see all\nthe constellations, and that some event already foretold would\ntake place on September 19th. Later, on July 18th, the script\nstated the date less definitely in the words, obviously referring\nto this same prophecy :\nProphecy is hard to work but it shall be done this time\u2014read\n.all with care after mid-September next and you will find all you\nwant for proof.\nOn July 3rd I looked through the script and found only\ntwo prophecies unfulfilled at that date, one being that there\nwould be \" more than one breach \" in my husband's family.3\n1 Too vague to be evidential.\n2 The script is quoted in App., p. 419.\n3 For the other (on Feb. 1, 1904) see above, p. 211. That, too,\nmay be considered to have been eventually fulfilled.\n\f328 Chapter XIII. [PART\nVery soon after the middle of September there was another\nbreach.1 As above stated my husband's nephew left for New\nZealand in September, and, I suppose, saw \" the rest \" of the\nconstellations, as any one must in a journey to the Antipodes.\nHis vessel sailed on September 22nd and September 19th had no\nspecial association with his journey. We heard of his intention\nto go on July 21st, so that both the above statements in\nthe script were antecedent to any knowledge of mine, as his\nplans had not been long discussed and were wholly unknown\nto us till July 21st.\n(12) On May llth, 1901, I had had a small party of ladies,\nto dinner\u2014my husband was dining out\u2014and after the depar\nture of the guests I had gone upstairs, when I felt a sudden\nstrong desire to write automatically, and came down again to\nfind materials. I wrote in the dark, at 11.10 p.m. Some\nearlier statements 2 in the script were veridical ; the conclusion\nwas as follows :\nDo not hurry. date this hoc est quod volui\u2014tandem.\nSiKaiocrvvrj KOI XaP\u00ae- oTjpifriavei <rvveToicriv.

The writer of the account in the Daily Mail stated\nthat a friend of his had been compelled to leave his rooms \"in\none of the Inns within a stone's throw of the Law Courts \" on\naccount of \" uncanny happenings.\" The writer and a friend\nof his arranged to sit through the night of May llth in the\nempty rooms and watch ievents. Precautions were taken to\nprevent intrusion, and powdered chalk was spread on the floor\nof the two smaller rooms1 \"to trace anybody or anything that\nmight come or go.\" The watchers saw a door unlatched and\nopened slowly, and heard the click of the handle. This was\nat 12.43 a.m. At 12.56 the same thing occurred to another\ndoor. Both doors were closed, and no mark was visible on\nthe powdered chalk. At 1.32 a.m. the right-hand door opened\nagain as before, and at 1.37 the left-hand door opened. At\n1.40 both doors closed simultaneously \" of their own accord.\"\nBetween 1.45 and 1.55 this happened twice again, so that there\nwere in all four openings and three closings unaccounted for.2\nThe last openings took place at 2.7 and 2.9, and both watchers\nnoticed marks on the chalk in the two little rooms. On\nexamination it was seen that the marks were \"clearly denned\nbird's footprints in the middle of the floor, three in the left-\nhand room and five in the right-hand room.\" The marks were\nidentical, and exactly 2| inches in size ; they might be com\npared to the footprints of a bird about the size of a turkey.\nThere were three toes and a short spur behind. Nothing\nfurther occurred. The footprints were seen at 2.30 ; they\nwaited till 3.30, and then went home. No attempt is made\nto explain the occurrence, and the correspondent says that he\nhas \"simply recorded facts.\"\nThe statement in the script, that the sticking of chalk to\nthe feet got over the difficulty, followed by a drawing of a\n1 There were four rooms in all.\n2 The first time the doors had been closed by the watchers.\n\f330 Chapter XIII. [PART\nbird with a leer is a singularly appropriate comment on the\nstory in the Daily Mail. But the remarkable point is that\nthe script was written at 11.10 p.m., whereas the first opening\nof the door did not occur till 12.43 a.m. and the footprints\nwere not observed till 2.30 a.m. The statement therefore of\nthe script anticipated the reported event by some three hours,\nand its publication by a still longer period. It is true that\nthe sprinkling of the chalk probably preceded the writing,\nbut there is no reason to think that the writer of the tale had\nany expectation as to the sort of marks he might find in the\nchalk. Nothing that had previously occurred suggested that\nthe supposed disturber of the rooms was a bird.1\nAt the time when this script was obtained I had no reason\nto attach any particular value to my automatic writing, and\nno steps were taken to obtain external corroboration of the\ndates of the script except entries in rny Diary and script-\nbook and communication of the writing at the first opportu\nnity to my husband. In this case the absurd element in the\nscript and the quaintness of the phrase about the chalk stick\ning to the feet drew special attention to the writing, and it\nwas discussed by us more than once. The word calx is\nambiguous ; it might mean \" heel \" as well as \" chalk,\" and\nit was not till we saw the story in the Westminster Gazette\nof May 16th that we found an interpretation for the Latin\nwords. The question of a connexion between the story and\nthe script is not affected by the value of the story. The\nscript was obtained on May llth, and whether or not a bird\nmade marks in the chalk in the early hours of May 12th, it\nis certain that a story to that effect was printed on May 13th\nand brought to my knowledge on May 16th.\n(13) On August 29th, 1901, at the end of an attempt to\nguess \/jLovoTria\\ov e? aio the script wrote :\nDon't try\u2014let it come. When you don't expect it will be plain.\n,October will help\u2014the 19th. Kemember.\nOn September 28th, when I was staying at Winchester, the\nscript contained the following:\n1Tho writer of the article in the Daily Mail was seen by Mr.\nPiddington, and stated that he and his friend had no anticipations\nas to what they might discover.\n\fmi.] Miscellaneous References to Future Events. 331\nThe old world & the new\u2014note the date\u2014-and the sequence\u2014and\ncount the days\u2014ten more & other nine then two.\nCounting the days\u2014twenty-one\u2014and adding them to Septem\nber 28th brought the date to October 19th, which I remem\nbered to have been already mentioned in the script. My\nhusband saw both passages of writing, but I mentioned to\nno one else the suggestion that any event was to be expected\non October 19th.\nOn October 16th I heard accidentally, and to my great sur\nprise, that some friends of mine were going to America shortly.\nI asked how soon they were to start, and the reply was ' Next\nSaturday.' It was only after a few minutes that I considered\nwhat day of the month ' Saturday' would be, and on finding that\nit was the 19th, remembered that something had been said in\nmy script about October 19th.\nIt will be seen that the remarks in the script, though they\nmight easily be more definite, unmistakeably refer to some\nconnexion on the 19th October between England and America.\nFrom enquiries subsequently made, it appeared that the\ndecision of my friends was recent, and that on Aug. 29th\nand Sept. 28th there was no one who knew, or could suppose, that\nany event connecting England and America likely to interest me\nwould occur on Oct. 19th. The information then could not have\nbeen conveyed to me by telepathy, and the only question for\nconsideration is whether it was sufficiently definite and dis\ntinctive to be beyond the range of conjecture or chance.\n(14) On December llth, 1901, the script wrote as follows :\nNothing too mean the trivial helps, gives confidence. Hence\nthis. Frost and a candle in the dim light Marmontel he\nwas reading on a sofa or in bed\u2014there was only a candle's light.\nShe will surely remember this. The book was lent not his own\u2014\nhe talked about it.\nThen, after a reference to a separate incident, recognised as\nsuch, there appeared a fanciful but unmistakeable attempt at\nthe name Sidgwick.\nNo meaning was conveyed to me by the above. The allusion\nto \"she\" and the name given suggested that I should apply to\nMrs. Sidgwick.\n\f332 Chapter XIII. [PART\nI accordingly wrote to Mrs. Sidgwick to ask if the allusion\nto Marmontel had any meaning for her. I heard from her on\nDecember 17th that she could make nothing of it, but that if\nthe name turned up in some MSS. which she was then reading,\nshe would let me know. I was away from home at this time,\nand had not had the opportunity of writing for some days.1 I\nhad, in fact, decided to abandon any attempt at writing till\nmy return home, but I was so disturbed all the 17th by a\ndesire to write that I made time, and at 6.50 that evening\nobtained the following:\nI wanted to write Marmontel is right. It was a French book,\na 2 Memoir I think. Passy may help Souvenirs de Passy or Fleury.\nMarmontel was not on the cover\u2014the book was bound and was lent\u2014\ntwo volumes in old-fashioned binding and print. It is not in any\npapers\u2014it is an attempt to make someone remember\u2014an incident.\nSoon after my return to Cambridge, about Dec. 25th, 1901,\nI was looking through a list of books\u2014which I had glanced\nat before Dec. llth\u2014and found an advertisement of 'Mar\nmontel, Moral Tales, Selected and Translated by G. Saintsbury.'\nThis, strange though such an admission may seem, was, as far\nI could remember, my first conscious knowledge of Marmontel *\nas a French writer.\nIn January, 1902, 1 wrote to our friend Mr. Marsh, asking him\nto come for a week-end visit, and he replied, fixing March 1st.\nI had had no communication with him since June, 1901, till\nthis letter in January. I sent him a postcard about Feb. 23rd,\nreminding him of the date of his expected visit, and he replied\nin a letter on Feb. 24th.\nOn March 1st Mr. Marsh arrived, and that evening at dinner\nhe mentioned that he had been reading Marmontel. I asked if\nhe had read the Moral Tales, and he replied that it was the\nMemoirs. I was interested in this reference to Marmontel, and\nasked Mr. Marsh for particulars about his reading, at the\nsame time explaining the reasons for my curiosity. He then\n!See above, pp. 227, 8. 2 Possibly \"or.\"\n3 I must have seen his name in French Histories or Literature Manuals.\nBut I have little first hand acquaintance with the period to which he\nbelongs, and was certainly not aware, till March, 1902, that he wrote\nMemoirs.\n\fLIII.] Miscellaneous References to Future Events. 333\ntold me that he got the book from the London Library, and took\nthe first volume only to Paris with him, where he read it on the\nevening of February 20th, and again on February 21st. On\neach occasion he read by the light of a candle, on the 20th\nhe was in bed, on the 21st lying on two chairs. He talked about\nthe book to the friends with whom he was staying in Paris.\nThe weather was cold, but there was, he said, no frost. The\nLondon Library copy is bound, as most of their books are,\nnot in modern binding, but the name ' Marmontel ' is on the\nback of the volume. The edition has three volumes; in Paris\nMr. Marsh had only one volume, but at the time of his visit\nto us he had read the second also.\nI asked him whether ' Passy ' or ' Fleury ' would ' help,' and\nhe replied that Fleury\"a name certainly occurred in the book,\nin a note ; he was not sure about Passy, but undertook to\nlook it up on his return to town, and to ascertain, as he\ncould by reference to the book, what part of the first volume\nhe had been reading in Paris. He is in the habit of reading\nin bed, but has electric light in his bedroom at home, so that\nhe had not read ' in bed or on a sofa by candle light ' for\nmonths, till he read Marmontel in Paris.\nOn his return to town Mr. Marsh wrote to me (March 4\n1902), that on Feb. 21st, while lying on two chairs he read\na chapter in the first volume of Marmontel's Memoirs describing\nthe finding at Passy of a panel, etc., connected with a story\nin which Fleury plays an important part.\nIt will thus be noted that the script in December, 1901,\ndescribes (as past) an incident which actually occurred two\nand a half months later, in February, 1902,\u2014an incident which\nat the time of writing was not likely to have been foreseen by\nany one. I ascertained from Mr. Marsh that the idea of reading\nMarmontel occurred to him not long before his visit to Paris.\nIt is probable that had he not seen me almost immediately\nupon his return, when his mind was full of the book, I should\nnever have heard of his reading it, and therefore not have\ndiscovered the application of the script of Dec. 16th and 17th.\nThe description is definite and in the main accurate. There\nare however errors : though the weather was cold, it does\nnot seem to have been actually freezing on either of the two\n\f334 Chapter XIII. [PART\nnights in question; the book was not in two volumes only,\nas seems implied, though only two volumes had been read\nwhen the incident was related to me ; the name Marmontel\nwas on the back of the book, though not on the face of\nthe cover ; the binding, though not modern, can hardly be\ndescribed as old-fashioned. But the reference to Passy and\nFleury\u2014names which, so far as I can discover, are not\ntogether in any passage of Marmontel's Memoirs except that\nread by Mr. Marsh on Feb. 21st\u2014is a precise and, I think,\nremarkable coincidence.\nTwo other points may be noted : (1) the refusal of the\nscript on Dec. 17th to accept the suggestion that the name\nMarmontel may refer to something in MSS. then being read\n(in December) by Mrs. Sidgwick; and (2) the omission of any\nreference to the name of the reader of Marmontel. The\nomission of this, the most conclusive piece of evidence of all,\nhad it been given, is paralleled by other incidents in the\nscript. In particular it may be noted that in the last two\nincidents narrated, where the allusion seems to be prophetic,\nthere is a marked omission of definite statements. Thus, in\nNo. 12, no reference is given to the place where the 'chalk-\nfooted bird' appeared, nor, in No. 13, to the person who was\nto go from ' the old world ' to the new.\nThe sentence, ' She will surely remember this,' in the writing\nof Dec. llth is unintelligible at least, if not misleading; the\nidea is apparently repeated on Dec. 17th in the words, \" it is\nan attempt to make some one remember.\" A possible\nexplanation of this is suggested by the occasional appearance\nin the script of what I have called conversations,1 where the\nthird person \" she \" plainly refers to myself, the writer, who\nis more frequently addressed as \" you.\" Thus on March 10th,\n1902, there was written: \"There is a letter for you gone astray\n\u2014it will arrive\u2014remember this date (here a gap, then) I have\ntold her of the letter, the strayed letter\u2014(another gap, then)\nyour husband etc. etc.\" Here you, her and your all seem tc-\nrefer to the writer, myself, part of the remarks being\napparently addressed to me and part spoken of me. In the\npresent case it is possible that what the writing intended to\niSee p. 68.\n\fLIII.] Miscellaneous References to Future Events. 335\nconvey was that when the actual incident was spoken of in\nthe presence of the writer\u2014as it was on March 1st, 1902, by\nMr. Marsh\u2014\"she would surely remember\" that this incident\nhad been described in the script.\nAlthough at this time the original writing was not posted\nto Sir Oliver Lodge I am able to offer external corroboration\nof the date of the first reference to Marmontel, as I have\npreserved Mrs. Sidgwick's letter received by me on December\n17th, 1901, which shows that the name had been mentioned\nto her by me before that day as occurring in my script.\n(15) On April 2nd, 1903, the script described a cross on\nstone steps in the following words :\nNow draw on five stone steps a cross [dravring] and on the\ncross hangs a wreath, a fresh green wreath. They have come to see\nit there\u2014out in the open on the hill side in the sound of the sea.\nIt is not a personal thing\u2014but know(rc). This is for evidence.\nThere is an inscription fastened to the wreath. In honour A. J. C.1\nIn ripis Douern I think it is for an old heroic deed. Grey sky\nand sea and the grey gulls cry in the wind. Kyrie eleeison.\nA few days later, April 10th, 1903, it added:\nCrosik or Croisic ought to help you to the cross and wreath.\nIn the Journal for November, 1903, among other unidentified\nallusions, I advertised the names Douern and Croisic in con\nnexion with a cross, but I received no information leading to\nany identification. Croisic is, as I knew, in Brittany, and the\nallusion to it may have been suggested by the word Douern\nand the talk of a stone cross on a hill side.\nThe cross remained completely unaccounted for, and no\nfurther help towards identification was given by the following\nallusion on Feb. 24th, 1905 :2\nWait now for this news. There is a grey stone cross on the\nhill side close by the spot\u2014a cross on stone steps. Voltigern\nno Volternius ager is more like.

See\nfacsimile on next page.\n2 The script of Feb., 1905, and March, 1906, falls outside the\nperiod dealt with in this paper, but is here included as it refers to\nthe same subject as the earlier script of April, 1903.\n\f336 Chapter XIII. [PAST\nOn March 17th, 1906, a river in Yorkshire was mentioned\nin my presence as the Derwent. The name \" Derwent \" had\nalways been vaguely suggested to me by the \" Dovinans \" of\nthe early script,1 and the \"Douern\" of April 3rd, 1903, had\nseemed a possible variant. The mention, then, of the York\nshire Derwent probably revived recollections of earlier script,\nand at 11.30 p.m. that evening was produced another reference\nto the cross, this time apparently suggesting that I should\nhave an opportunity of seeing and recognising the cross on its\nfive steps, and the green wreath :\nStone I want to say. Stone a white stone and no inscription\nbut you would recognise if you saw. Can you not find the cross\non its five steps and the green wreath ?\nDomus resonantis Albuneae * where flows the stream o'er Dufa's\ncliff, the Derwent's wandering course. On the banks of the stream\u2014\nthe Derwent water, not a lake\u2014wait and see yourself what I mean.\nThis revived my interest in the original unidentified cross\non five stone steps, and led me to look out for any possible\nmeans of verifying the statements of the script. The descrip\ntion had always puzzled me as it seemed to imply two incon\nsistent things, (a) an old heroic deed and (6) a modern\nmemorial, suggested by the fresh green wreath and the initials\nA. J. C. The second of these initials, as I noted at the time,\nwas by no means as distinct as the first and third.

I had made Miss Curtois'\nacquaintance in the autumn of 1905, and visited her for the\nfirst time on December llth, 1905. I had tea with her on\nthat day, but I have no recollection of looking at anything\nin her room and certainly made no examination of her books\nor pictures. It was a very foggy day and we were busy\ntalking.\nOn my second visit, however, on April 4th, before the\narrival of the other sitters, Miss Curtois and I had some\ntalk about books, and in so doing I looked over her book\nshelves. I then saw hanging on the wall a photograph of\na cross on stone steps which reminded me at once of the\ncross described in the script. I asked her what it was and\nshe told me that it was a cross set up by herself in memory\nof her mother. I then asked Mrs. Curtois' initials and found\nthat they were A. H. C. The cross had been erected from the\ndesign of Mr. Jessopp. I next asked Miss Curtois whether\nthere had not at some time been a green wreath on the\ncross\u2014there was none in the photograph at which I was\nlooking\u2014and she, with some surprise, replied in the affirma\ntive and added that there had been some discussion about a\ngreen wreath which was at one time placed on the cross. I\nsubsequently obtained from her the following information and\na photograph (here reproduced) of the cross with the green\nwreath attached.\nIn the churchyard of Washingborough, a village near Lincoln,\non the river Witham, was an old pedestal of five stone steps.\nOn this pedestal a modern cross was erected from the designs\nof Mr. Jessopp in memory of Mrs. Curtois, and dedicated on\nJuly 5th, 1903. There is no inscription on cross or pedestal.\nThere is a tablet in the village church commemorating the\nerection as follows : \" In loving memory of Ann Henrietta,\nwidow of the Eev. Atwill Curtois. . . . this tablet has been\nerected and the village cross replaced by her daughter,\nMargaret Anne Curtois, 1903.\" A green wreath was once\nplaced on the cross, most probably at Christmas, 1903. Miss\nCurtois writes in April, 1906 : \" There was a great deal of\n\f338 Chapter XIII. [PART\ndiscussion about the wreath as it was feared that it might\ninjure the cross, and the experiment was not repeated.\"\nThe village of Washingborough lies on a little hill near the\ntop of which stands the cross. Miss Curtois writes that she\nhas seen the country beneath it flooded and dotted with sea\ngulls, but the sea is some thirty miles away.\nIt thus appears that a few days after the reference in my\nscript (March 17th, 1906) suggesting that I should have an\nopportunity of seeing and recognising the cross which had\nbeen described first on April 2nd, 1903, I did see and recog\nnise such a cross and the initials of the person in whose\nhonour it was erected were very like those given in the\nscript. The suggestion in the script of ancient and modern\nassociations also corresponds with the facts. It is correct to\nsay\u2014or rather there was one occasion at least when it might\nhave been said with truth : \" on the cross hangs a fresh\ngreen wreath,\" and \" they have come to see it there out in\nthe open on the hill side,\" but not \" in the sound of the sea.\"\nIt is also true that there is \" no inscription.\" In the first\nscript it was said that there was an inscription fastened to\nthe wreath ; in the last script, \" a white stone and no\ninscription.\" Miss Curtois does not know whether any inscrip\ntion was attached to the wreath but, as stated above, there\nis no inscription on cross or pedestal.\nNo explanation has been found to account for the names\nassociated in the script with the cross : Douern, Croisic,\nVolternius or Voltigern. There seems no connexion between\nthem and Washingborough or the Witham. But the general\nresemblance between the description in the script and the\ncross erected by Miss Curtois, and the near approach to\ncorrectness in the initials given in the script, seem to make\nthe incident worth relating. It should be said that a photo\ngraph of the cross with the wreath on it hangs in another\npart of Miss Curtois' room, so that it is possible that I saw\nthis picture in December, 1905, and that a recollection of it\nproduced the script of March 17th, 1906. But when that\nscript was produced, I had no expectation of visiting Miss\nCurtois' house. Her letter asking me to do so was written on\nMarch 23rd and was received by me on March 24th.\n\fLIII.] Miscellaneous References to Future Events. 339\nIn any case the original description of the cross and wreath\npreceded the dedication of the cross by three months and the\nhanging of the wreath by a still longer period, probably nine\nmonths.\nThis concludes the account of what I prefer to call ' anticipa\ntions ' rather than ' prophecies.' Upon their value the reader\nmust form his own judgment.\nI have now accomplished, as well as I can, the task which\nI proposed to myself at the beginning of this paper. I have\ngiven an account, as complete as I could make it, of the\nautomatic phenomena obtained by me in the course of the\nfour years ending December 31, 1904. Similar phenomena\nhave continued to occur, and are still occurring, but I have\nnot found the analytic attitude of mind necessary for the\nexamination of the phenomena conducive to the receptive and\nunpreoccupied condition which seems, generally speaking,\nrequired for their production. There have, therefore, been\nseveral intervals in the years 1905 and 1906 during which I\nhave not attempted to obtain any automatic writing, but\nwhenever I have tried the product has been similar and the\nresults are, as far as a cursory examination enables me to\njudge, of the same general type as those here described.\n\f340 Appendix.

At the time that the notes\nwere made I had no idea that anyone but myself would see the\nrecord.\nExtract from note book, dated May 9, 1894. \"Last night I had a\nvivid sense of touch in a dream. I had a long complicated happy\ndream about C.H.F. [a friend who had been hopelessly ill since\nhis boyhood] who was quite well again and coming to be with\nus. He was much older, and in some ways altered. I was\ntremendously happy, happier than one can be when awake (the\nsensation was keener), and at the end, as I was driving with\n\fLin.] Appendix. 387\nC.H.F. 'home,' I felt as if it was all too good to be true, and\ntouched his arm to reassure myself. The sensation was wonderful.\nI had placed my right arm, wearing a jacket sleeve (which I can\nsee quite plainly) against his left arm, in a great coat\u2014he was\ndriving me, and the sensation of touch was more vivid than I\nhave ever known it to one's bare hand or arm. It was a positive\npleasure in itself, and brought a convincing sense of reality,\u2014so\nconvincing that I have felt all day as if I had really been with\nC.H.F. ; I cannot describe the sensation ; there was no ' thrill,'\nno 'emotion,' but only an extraordinary sense of having felt\nsomething real,\u2014a most delightful and inexplicable pleasure.\"\nExtract from note book, dated April 20, 1898. \" Last night\u2014or\nrather early this morning, for when I woke it was light\u2014I had\nanother dream where physical and mental emotion were combined.\nThere had been some confused and exciting episodes,\u2014which I can\nnot disentangle\u2014but my general impression was that some man\n(unknown) had been acting harshly or despotically to my great\nindignation. Suddenly I found myself walking along with my right\narm from hand to elbow resting in contact upon his left arm.\nThe warmth physically felt brought to my mind a certainty that\nmy former impression about this man's conduct was wrong, and\nthat really all was right. I can only describe my mental sensation\nas a physical sensation of glow, and the enjoyment of the fulfilled\nsense of touch was intense,\u2014so that the recollection of it all day\ngives me great pleasure. The sense of touch was physical and mental\n\u2014I was conscious of the actual touch on my arm, and of a similar\ntouch on my mind, both of which removed an uncomfortable\nimpression and filled me with the joy which comes with knowing.\"\nEXTRACTS FROM SCRIPT BEARING ON A.W.V.'s EXPERIMENT, viz.\nAN ATTEMPT TO GET THREE GREEK WORDS AUTOMATICALLY\nWRITTEN IN THE SCRIPT.

Nov. 25 1904.\nDear Mr. Constable,\nI have nothing very definite to report about\nthe envelope, which I have not yet opened. I have sat three times\nwith it on Nov. 18, 23, and to-night. I have a curious impression\nto-night that I ought to write to you, but I really have very little\nto say.\nMy general impression seems to be that the contents of this\nletter are less important than the circumstances connected with the\nexperiment ; that this envelope of yours is one of two ; that the\nexperiment was suggested to you by someone els.e ; that the whole\nthing has some connexion with the question of opening a sealed\nenvelope of Mr. Myers', and is somehow intended as a preliminary\ntest before doing it.\nI cannot judge how far I have made up all this, and the actual\nwords of the script are not clear. So far as I can judge, some\nenvelope contains a drawing [above copied\\ and there are attempts\nat a short word, but it is not stated that the envelope you have\nsent me is the one containing these. What is clearly said is that\nthere are 2 envelopes and that I hold the less important.\nPossibly it may be that both envelopes have some curly design\nwithin them, but one only has the word.\n\fmi.] Appendix. 399\n. . . contrary to ray custom, I have more impression than the words\nwarrant, and so I write this to you.

These are the chief impres\nsions, and the script has made curly drawings and an attempt at\na word.\"\n(6) [For contents of sealed envelope see above, No. lc.]\n(7o) \" Wick Court near Bristol 28 Nov. 1904.\nDear Mrs. Verrall,\nFacts as to present experiment.\nI dined with the Council at the last meeting. Three others with\nmyself were speaking of Mr. Myers' sealed letter. One said 'I\nthink we have sufficient material now to open Myers' letter.'\nI said\u2014I think afterwards\u2014to Professor Barrett or Mr. Feilding\n' I doubt the letter test, the letter may read itself to the medium.'\nGoing home I worried over a test. Could I make a distinction\nbetween the effect of a letter itself on a medium and the thoughts\nimpressed (on the letter ?) by the writer ?\nSo I wrote two sealed letters, one after the other. One I sent\nyou, the other I now enclose, still sealed. So far as I can under\nstand you have failed (not altogether) as to the contents and\nthoughts of the two letters. But where did you find out the fact\nof two letters and (perhaps) the genesis of the two letters ?\nI think the experiment was not suggested to me by anyone\u2014I\nworked but the idea myself.\nYours gratefully,\nF.

Virgil's Camilla has not yellow hair, but Virgil's Camilla\nis obviously suggested by the words nexit in hastam (Aen. XL 554-5).\nPossibly the yellow hair, flava comam, is an anticipation of Berenice's\ndeified locks of yellow hair in the script of Oct. 5th. The phrase\ncomes Orionis, \" companion of Orion,\" suggests a constellation, and\nso do the following words, \" the countless hosts of heaven.\"\nOct. 5, 1903. The early phrases refer beyond a doubt to Catullus'\npoem on Ariadne and Dionysus, a famous passage, which is\nrecalled by the allusions to dawn and the sea. The lament of Ariadne\nand the unexpected arrival of the god, as well as the inclusion of\nAriadne's crown among the stars, are referred to later in the script.\nThe subject of the next following poem of Catullus (Cat. LXVI.) is\n\fLIII.] Appendix. 429\nthe transference to the constellations of Berenice's hair, and in\nthis poem Catullus refers, naturally enough, to both the recent\nconstellations, Ariadne's crown and Berenice's hair.\nIbi vario ne solum in lumine caeli\nex Ariadneis aurea temporibus\nftxa corona foret, sed nos guoque fulgeremus\ndevotae flavi verticis exuviae,\nsays the lock speaking of itself in Cat.

The flaming crown upon a\nwell-loved head repeats the leading idea. I have discovered nothing\nto account for the Olympian lilies, a phrase which, as far as I know,\nis original.\n(24) Symposium.\nQuotations completely given in text, pp. 310-318.\nEXTRACT FROM SCRIPT TO ILLUSTRATE PROPHECY UNFULFILLED.\nSEE CHAP.

The mystic\nwheel of Pythagorean or Orphic significance appears usually to be\nfour-spoked (see Lower Italy Vases represented on pp. 602-603 of\nProlegomena to Greek Religion by Miss Harrison), and the wheel of\nIxion in the lower world is expressly so described by Pindar. On\nseven occasions before the appearance of the mysterious \" wheel of\nthe master,\" the script had alluded to wheels, often in connexion\nwith the number four. Thus on March 27th, 1901, we have\n\"petorrita pro carroni. Saepe cwrrus deorum.\" Petorrita is an old\nLatin word for a four-wheeled waggon, petor being equivalent to\nquattuor (four), and rita representing rota (wheel). Carroni is a false\nform, carrus being a two-wheeled car. But in spite of the error the\nallusion is clear to \"a four-wheeled waggon instead of a car ; often\nthe chariot of the gods.\"\nAgain on April 24th, 1901, there are drawings followed by the\nwords \"always in fours symetrically posited.\" The first drawing\nrepresents four circles joined together, the second a square and\nfour dots.\nOn June 27th, 1901, the script wrote : Omina accipe\u2014velociter currit\nalatus pes, vehementior rota ocissime autem nuntius dei alipes super maria\nvolitans. \" Receive the omens, swiftly runs the winged foot, more\n\f432 Appendix. [PART LIII.\nviolently the wheel, and fastest the wing-footed messenger of God\nflitting over the seas.\"\nOn September 4th, 1901, there were drawings in the script repre\nsenting four circles followed by an arrangement of lines and circles\nin fours which might symbolise a four-wheeled waggon and shafts.\nThe phrase sic semper sic ubique followed this drawing and the same\nphrase had immediately preceded the description on March 27th,\n1901, of the four-wheeled waggon.\nOn March 2nd, 1902, there was a further attempt to represent\nby rough drawings something grouped in fours. The drawings were\npreceded by the words : \"1234 and then again\u2014four and four\nand pause\u2014and then repeat.\" Then after the first drawing [for\nfacsimiles see App., p. 346] came : \" do you see it now ? \" and\nafter more drawings, \" I have tried to tell you this before.\" The\nlater drawings apparently represent a revolving group of four con\nnected objects and are followed by the words : acguiret vires eundo,\n\" it will gain strength by going.\" This suggests, though it does not\nmention, a wheel.\nOn April 14th, 1902, a rough drawing was followed by the words\n\" quadriform too, as of old I have said.\" Then after another rough\ndrawing the words \" not right.\"\nAnother allusion on May 16th, 1902, to ambrosial night wander\ning on her car has been commented on above (see p. 43) ; it may,\nhowever, have no connexion with the series of attempts to suggest\na wheel.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nINDEX TO VOL.
