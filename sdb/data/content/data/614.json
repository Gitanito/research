There\nare very few living now besides myself who have been cognizant\nfrom the beginning of what was in the minds of the founders of the\nSociety, or who have been from the earliest days in the imier circle\nof workers, and this makes it suitable for me to attempt this paper.\n^\nThe idea of foimding a Society to investigate our subjects and the\nenergy which brought it to fruition were Professor W. F. Barrett's^\n(Professor of Physics at the Royal College of Science, Dublin, and\nafterwards Sir William Barrett, F.R.S.). After soimding those whom\nhe knew to be interested in the questions to be investigated, among\nwhom were Myers, Gurney and Sidgwick, he convened a meeting in\nLondon in January 1882 to discuss the formation of a Society, and\ngot the Society finally established in February of that year. The\nnumber of members and associates was small to begia with. In the\n1 Read by Lord BaKour at a General Meeting of the Society, 1 July 1932.\n2 In the first list of Members and Associates of the Society published in\nSeptember 1882, no name published in our last list 1930 appears except that of\nMrs F. W. H. Myers. My own name does not appear till January 1884. I do\nnot distinctly remember the cause of this delay, but I think it was due to my\nholding in 1882 a responsible position in another youthful institution\u2014Newn-\nham College (for Women) at Cambridge. It was probably not thought desirable\nto risk associating the CoUege in the public mind with what was likely to be\nregarded as a cranky Society. If this recollection is right it gives some measure\nof the difference of the position of our subject of study then and now. Though\nnot technically a Member I was entirely cognizant of the doings of the Society\nand its Council from the beginning.\n3 He knew that there was no existing scientific society in the world willing to\ntake the subject up, and the British Association had refused in 1876 to publish\na paper of his concerning telepathy.\n\f2 Mrs Henry Sidgivick rpART\nL.\nfirst printed list\u2014September 1882\u2014there are only one hundred\nnames. But the number increased rather rapidly as our existence\nand work became known, and though later the increase became less\nin proportion to the total number it continued fairly regularly, though\nwith some fluctuations, till we reached what I may call our peak\nnumber in 1920. We began that year with 403 Members and 902\nAssociates\u2014together 1,305. But in that year because of the greatly\nincreased cost of printing and other things after the war,\nthe guinea a year paid by Associates did not cover their share\nof administrative expenses \u2014printing, salaries, rent, etc. \u2014 and\nit was decided to discontinue, at least for a time, the election of new\nAssociates. The number of Associates has therefore since then in-\nevitably diminished, losses by deaths and resignations not being\nreplaced. The number of full Members paying two guineas a year\ncontinued to increase but not so fast as that of Associates diminished,\nso that at the beginning of 1931, we had 586 Members and 368\nAssociates\u2014in all 954, and unfortunately at the beginning of the\npresent year, 1932, we found our numbers reduced to 501 Members\nand 308 Associates. This serious reduction, which we hope is tem-\nporary, is largely due to the prevailing financial stringency.\nThe usefulness of a Society, if it can get itself established and can\nsecure sufficiently the confidence of the public, is obvious in work\nlike ours. It provides a centre to which accounts of experiences and\nexperiments can be sent and compared, where documents can be\nkept and referred to, where discussion can go on, information and\nadvice can be sought and obtained. The existence of a Society also\nfacilitates experiments, and inquiries of a statistical kind, of which\nseveral have been conducted from early days of the Society and\nrecently. But perhaps the most important use of a Society is that it\ncan publish in Proceedings material collected and the results of work\ndone\u2014and I do not think I shall be accused of boasting if I say that\nour forty volumes of Proceedings are a valuable mine of information\nand discussion on the subjects we deal with. And further, a Society\nprovides a local habitation for a Library, which for serious students of\nthe subject is, of course, important. We have had one from the\nbeginning of the Society, but it was a very small affair at first, and its\ngrowth, depending as it largely did on gifts of books, was somewhat\nirregular ; but now through the able management of our Librarian,\nMr Theodore Besterman, and with the immense assistance of a much\nappreciated grant from the Carnegie Trustees, it is probably as com-\nplete a special Library for psychical research as can be found any-\nwhere, and provides for students of the subject most of the special\nbooks that they may need.^\n1 Members and Associates can read on the premises, and Members can also\nborrow books.\n\f126] The Society for Psychical Research 3\nAnotlier advantage of a Society suitably housed is that it can have\na room or rooms for experiments, whether these experiments are\norganised by the Council or by private Members with the consent of\nthe Council ; and also for discussion by groups of Members.\nIn securing through the Society the material advantages indirectly\naiding investigation of which I have been speaking, and also in\nmeeting the actual expenses of investigation, finance has always been\nan important element. The membership subscriptions have never\nfurnished sufficient funds to meet the expenses necessary, or at least\ndesirable, in carrying on the Society's work. We have, however, had\ngenerous help in gifts and legacies from our supporters, and the\nCouncil has seldom appealed in vain when it felt that help was re-\nquired. This help has come in money and in kind, as for example\nwhen our seance-room was built and fitted up for us. And in 1902\nand 1903 two gifts from Members of \u00a3750 and \u00a3250 respectively were\nreceived towards an endowment fund which was duly established and\nplaced in the hands of trustees in that year. Other gifts have been\nreceived, and in that same year (1903) Mr A. N. Alvsakov, a Russian\nMember of the Society of long standing and a life-long investigator\ninto psychical phenomena, died^ and bequeathed to the S.P.R. a sum\nof (in English money) \u00a33,805. This generous bequest was added to\nthe endowment fund. The income from this fund was allowed to\naccumulate for many years, and the fund now produces nearly \u00a3400\na year.\nWhile we are on the subject of finance it may be remarked that we\nhave never paid for any cases we have received, or for literary con-\ntributions to Proceedings or Journal ; we did, however, on at any\nrate one occasion pay for the drafting of an ofiicial report of one of our\ninvestigations. And also in rather recent years, the number of\nforeign periodicals devoted to psychical research having gradually\ngreatly increased, and it appearing advisable to keep our Members\nmore or less in touch with them and through them with what is going\non elsewhere in connection with the subject, it was decided to pay a\nMember for supplying us regularly with short reviews of their con-\ntents for the Journal.\nIt should be mentioned that perhaps the most important thing\nthat has enabled us to carry on our work without larger funds\nis the great amount of gratuitous work done for us not only by\nhonorary officers and members of the Council, but by others, in in-\nvestigations and collection of material, not to speak of administrative\nwork.\nThe first Council\u2014eighteen Members and President (Henry\nSidgwick)\u2014 were all earnest inquirers, and many of them (including\nthose who may be called the principal founders, Barrett, Myers.\n1 See memorial notice of him. Journal, xi. 85.\n\f4 Mrs Henry Sidgwick [part\nGurney and Sidgwick^) experienced investigators. But they differed\nwidely in their views ;\nsome, e.g. Mr Stainton Moses, beiag ardent\nSpiritualists and others merely inquirers, sometimes tending to be\nvery sceptical inquirers. This mixture, both in the Society and its\nCouncil, was deliberately planned, so as to keep the field available to\ninvestigators as wide and their minds as open as possible. But of\ncourse, it made it impossible for the Society to have any collective\nview as a Society, and accordingly, in a preliminary note to the\nSociety's constitution it is \" expressly stated that membership of this\nSociety does not imply the acceptance of any particular explanation\nof the phenomena investigated, nor any belief as to the operation, in\nthe physical world, of forces other than those recognised by Physical\nScience.\" This has continued to be the Society's attitude through-\nout its fifty years of life, though it is not, I think, always understood,\neven by Members, that it is of no use asking what does the S.P.E.\nthink about this or that. Individual members or groups of members\nmay, and do have views of course, but the only thing either the Society\nor its CouncU collectively agree about, is that the questions raised by\npsychical research are important and investigation desirable.\nThe Council began its w^ork by dividing the subjects to be investi-\ngated roughly into five classes\u2014Thought-reading (now included\nunder telepathy) ; Mesmerism ; Reichenbach's experiments ;\nAp-\nparitions, Haunted Houses, etc. ;\nPhysical Phenomena of Spiritual-\nism ; \u2014and by appointing committees to undertake each. There was\nalso a literary committee responsible for collecting existing evidence\nand spontaneous cases.\nWork has been published in our Proceedings in all the above men-\ntioned departments. The plan of having standing committees\nappointed by the Council to carry out investigations in each class did\nnot, however, last very long. It was felt that the Council would al-\nmost necessarily to some indefinite extent, become saddled with\nresponsibility for opinions or conclusions reached by its own com-\nmittees, and that responsibility both for facts and reasonings in the\npapers and reports published should rest entirely with their authors.^\nIt remained with the Council to decide before publishing a paper that\nit was, so far as they could judge, bonafide, and its contents worthy of\nconsideration, and that it dealt with subjects within the range of the\n^ For some account of their investigations before 1882 see Proceedings, vol.\niv, and Barrett's Reminiscences, Proceedings, vol. xxxiv. They were not of\ncourse the only pioneers. They had, for example at their disposal the published\nworks on our subjects of Sir WUliam Crookes, of Lord Adare (afterwards Lord\nDuiiraven) concerning D.D. Home, of Mr Stainton Moses (himseli a medium)\n\u2014\nsee Myers's account of him after his death in Proceedings, vol. ix ; and the\nReijort on Spiritualism of the Committee of the London Dialectical Society.\n^ Proceedings, ii. 238 ; Journal, i. 223 n.\n\f126] The Society for Psychical Research\nSociety's work. In this it followed the practice of the Royal Society.\nThe new arrangement did not and does not prevent the Council from\nmaking, when funds permit, grants in aid of what seem likely to be\nuseful investigations, or even from undertaking such investigations\nitself in special cases. The Council still has a committee of reference\nby which all papers must be passed before they are admitted to\nProceedings.\nThe only standing committee that survived for some time longer\nwas the literary committee which was responsible for receiving and\nexamining cases sent in to the Society. The nimiber of accounts of\nspontaneous experiences that came in was a surprise to us,^ and the\nlabour involved in getting the evidence in these cases into a condition\nsufficiently complete for publication was considerable. It was ca,l-\nculated that over 10,000 letters were written during the year 1883 in\nthe course of collection and verification of evidence.^ And besides\ncorrespondence with informants they were as far as possible inter-\nviewed. In the early days it was less clear, even to the investigators,\nthan it is now what further information was desirable or even neces-\nsary to complete a given case. And consequently more trouble was\ninvolved than now when our informants themselves understand\nbetter what is needed and are also, I think, less shy than they were at\nfirst of allowing their experiences, especially with their names, to\nappear in print. But I regret to say that for a good many years past\nthe number of cases sent to us has been much less than it used to be at\nfirst. This is no doubt partly because the more remote cases in our\ninformants' experience have already been sent to our Society or pub-\nlished elsewhere, and probably still more because our standard has\nrisen. It is widely known now that the Council are very chary of\npublishing any but accounts at first hand of experiences, and those of\nexperiences either of recent occurrence or recorded very near the\ntime they happened. Still I think more would be sent to us if it were\nmore generally realised that carefully recorded cases continue from a\nscientific point of view to be very important and that the trouble in-\nvolved in getting them into an evidential form is well worth while.\nEach new case not only adds to the evidence for the occurrence of\nsuch experiences but may throw fresh light on their nature and\ncauses\u2014on why and how they occur.\nIt was in the year I referred to just now, 1883,\u2014the second of the\nSociety's existence\u2014that it was decided to bring out a book on\nPhantasms of the Living, of which Gurney, Myers and F. Podmore\nwere to be the authors. It was sanguinely supposed that this book\nwould be ready in the following year, but the evidence kept growing\n1 It may be repeated that no pecuniary reward of any kind was ever oSered\nor given for a case.\n^ Proceedings, ii. 45.\n\f6 Mrs Henry Sidgwick [part\noil our liaiuls, and it was not till 1886 that the book appeared. Some\nof the meetings of the Literary Committee in the early days of work\non Phantasms of the Living took place at the house of Henry Sidgwick\nand myself at Cambridge, and they were, as I well remember, always\ninteresting and often amusing, as anyone who knew Gurney, Myers\nand Sidgwick will understand.\nTo facilitate study and comparison of the cases we received, they\nwere printed on separate sheets (at the expense of a Member of the\nCommittee) of which each Member could thus have a copy and make\nhis own observations on it. Copies were also kept at the Society's\noffice where other Members of the Society could, if they wished,\nexamine and comment on them. The great majority of these cases\nwere capable of explanation by telepathy between the living, mean-\ning by that term the influence of one incarnate mind on another\nwithout the intervention of the senses, and so came imder the head of\nwhat we have called Phantasms of the Living. But there were also\ncases of phantasms of the dead, premonitions, and other kinds which\nof course did not come into the book. All that seemed valuable\namong them have, however, been dealt with in articles in the Pro-\nceedings or otherwise.^ At the end of 1884 the printing of cases on\nseparate slips was superseded by a monthly Journal for private cir-\nculation among Members and Associates in which cases under con-\nsideration could be printed and studied more conveniently. The\nJournal was also intended to be a vehicle for communication from\nthe Coimcil to the Society, Reports of Meetings, etc., and, moreover,\nto enable Members to contribute, if they wished to do so, letters or\nbrief articles, or otherwise to discuss matters bearing on the Society's\nwork. In short, it was intended for private communication between\nMembers, on matters not necessarily meant for the public. One im-\n^ Thus a paper on phantasms of the dead appeared in Proceedings, vol. iii ; on\npremonitions in vol. v ; on apparitions occurring soon after death in vol. v\n( begun by Gurney and after his death finished by Myers) ;\n\" Recognised appar-\nitions more than a year after death \" by Myers ;\n\" Phantasms of the Dead from\nanother point of view \" by Podmore ;\n\" Defence of Phantasms of the Dead \"\nby Myers. These last three papers, with discussion, are in Proceedings, vol. vi\n;\n\" Telepathic Clau-voyance,\" vol. vti ;\n\" Alleged Movements of Objects without\nContact,\" two papers by Myers, Proceedings, vol. vii, \" Indications of continued\nTerrene Knowledge on the part of Phantasms of the Dead,\" by Myers,\nProceedings, vol. viii. In Proceedings, vol. xi, is an article by Podmore quoting\ncases of poltergeists ; and at a much later date, there is a paper in Proceedings,\nvol. xxxiii, in which are collected cases parallel to those in the book Phantasms\nof the Living, received after that was pubhshed. A few obviously important\ncases have been placed at once in Proceedings without waiting to be placed in\ngroups e.g. \" The Pv-ecord of a Haunted House \" in vol. viii ;\n\" Subconscious\nReasonmg \" by Professor Romaine Newbold, vol. xii ; a note on Fisher's\nghost by H. Arthur Smith in vol. xiv ;\n\" Recent cases of Premonition and\nTelepathy \" by the Rev. M. A. Bayfield, vol. xxix ; and \" The Will of James L.\nChaffin \" in vol. xxxvi.\n\f126] The Society for Psychical Research 7\njwrtaut reason for printing it for private circulation only was, and is,\nthat informants sometimes send us cases which they are not willing\nshould be published, at any rate immediately, though willing that\nthey should be privately printed for the use of the Society. The\nJournal has been carried on in the same spirit ever since and has, I\nthink, served its purpose well.\nIt may be seen, not only from the book Phantasms of the Living,\nbut from a glance at the early volumes of Proceedings that telepathy\nor thought-transference, experimental and spontaneous, occupied\nmore of the Society's attention at first than did other departments of\ninvestigation. Accounts of important experiments in various forms\nof telepathy are published in each of the first eight volumes of Pro-\nceedings, but after that similar papers will be found only in volumes\nxi, xxi, xxvii, xxix, xxxi and xxxiv. This concentration at first on\ntelepathy was not, I think, the result of any deliberate plan on the\npart of the Coimcil. Telepathy forced itself on the Society rather\nthan was sought by it. In far the greater part of the spontaneous\ncases sent to us which seemed to afford evidence of some super-\nnormal process, the process was apparently telepathic, or at least a\ntelepathic explanation was consistent with the facts as reported ;\nand opportunities of experimenting in telepathy presented them-\nselves more than they have done in later years. When the Society\nwas founded Professor Barrett had experiments with the Creary\nchildren actually in hand. Later came the experiments in which\nMr G. A. Smith was concerned either as percipient or agent, and\nwhich went on in one form or another into the nineties ;\nand the very\nimportant experiments conducted at Liverpool by Mr Guthrie and\nothers with the young ladies employed in the drapery business\nwhich was under his management. Valuable accoimts of experiments\nwere also sent to us from France through Professor Richet, and also\nfrom Germany by Dr Dessoir and Dr von Schrenck-Notzing.\nThe idea of thought-transference was, as it were, in the air, in this\ncountry at least, in the early eighties, because of an amusement called\nthe \" willing game \" which was in vogue both in private drawing-\nrooms and on public platforms. Some action, often very complicated,\nto be performed by one of the party, whom we may call the per-\ncipient, was decided on during his absence from the room. The wilier\nthen held his hand or put his hands on his shoulders or forehead, and\nif experimenting seriously, took pains to avoid giving any indications\nwhile willing him to perform the prescribed action, which he very\noften succeeded in doing. Then there was much discussion on the\ncause of success. Was it thought-reading, or was it \" muscle-read-\ning \"\u2014the conscious or unconscious interpretation of slight move-\nments made by the wilier.^ Occasionally some percipients succeeded\n1 See note on muscle-reading by the Rev. E. H. Sugden, Proceedings, i. 291.\n\f8 Mrs Henry Sidgwick [part\nwithout contact at all, which gave strong snp])ort to the advocates\nof the thought-reading explanation. AH this naturally stimulated\ninterest in the subject, and led to general talk, and may have\noccasionally helped to reveal some percipients who really possessed\na thought-reading faculty.\nEven in the Society's earliest days telepathy was not of course the\nonly subject to which the Society devoted attention. There were\nreports from its various standing committees already mentioned.\nGurney, notwithstanding his preoccupation with Phantasms of the\nLiving, almost from the first did excellent experimental work on the\npsychological side of hypnotism. Myers was already occupied with\nthe subliminal self, automatism and kindred subjects. These sub-\njects he discussed at intervals in papers in Proceedings, which were\nafterwards to be incorporated in his book Human Personality and\nits Survival of Bodily Death.\nIn 1884 Madame Blavatsky. the founder in 1875 (in the U.S.A) of\nthe Theosophical Society, visited England, and the principal workers\nin the S.P.R. saw a good deal of her. Evidence which made a great\nimpression on them was offered by her and her friends. This evidence\nincluded accounts of apparitions of themselves voluntarily produced\nat a distance^ by persons in India, and of telekinetic phenomena\nsuch as are said to occur in the presence of physical mediums. The\nCouncil appointed a committee to examine into the matter, and a\npreliminary report by them, more or less favourable, was actually\nprinted and distributed to Members of the S.P.R., though never pub-\nlished. It was felt, however, that before any final conclusion could\nbe arrived at, a Member of the Committee must be sent to India to\nexamine into the alleged phenomena and so far as possible cross-\nquestion the persons concerned on the spot. Mr Richard Hodgson,\nscholar of St John's College, Cambridge, and a graduate of Melbourne\nUniversity, Australia, was selected for this work. He went out in\nNovember 1884, returning April 1885, having spent three months in\nIndia, and his report, jiublished in Proceedings, vol. iii, would, I\nthink, convince any impartial reader that the apparently marvellous\nphenomena were all produced by trickery by Mnie Blavatsky and her\nconfederates. Before Mr Hodgson started, two of these confederates\nat the headquarters of the Theosophical Society at Madras, Mr and\nMrs Coulomb, had turned against that Society and its founders, and\ngiven a number of very incriminating letters, written to them by\nMadame Blavatsky, to the editors of the Christian College Magazine\nat Madras, who had published some of them. Mme Blavatsky de-\nclared that they, or at least the incriminating portions of them were\nforgeries.\n1 We have of course in Phantasms of the Living and Proceedings good evidence\nof such voluntary apparitions quite apart from the Theosophical Society.\n\f126] The Society for Psychical Research 9\nThe question of their genuineness had, of course, to be h)oked into\nby Mr Hodgson, which was very thoroughly done, and in the result\nthe letters no doubt were of material assistance in helping him to many\ndetails of the conclusion he and, after him, our whole Committee\narrived at\u2014namely, that there was a very strong presumption that\nall the marvellous narratives put forward are to be explained as due\neither to deliberate deception carried out by, or at the instigation of,\nMme Blavatsky, or to spontaneous illusion or hallucination, or un-\nconscious misrepresentation or invention on the part of the wit-\nnesses. And the testimony to these marvels was in no case sufficient,\ntaking amount and quality together, to resist the force of this\ngeneral presumption.\nI have dwelt on this investigation at perhaps undue length, be-\ncause I think it had a great effect on our understanding of the\ndifficulty of our work and of the care required not to arrive at con-\nclusions prematurely.\nFrom 1884 to 1887 much of the energy of the Society and a large\nproportion of its printed matter in Proceedings and Journal was for a\ntime taken up by discussion and correspondence concerning the\nphysical phenomena of Spiritualism and especially by the slate-writ-\ning (writing on slates by alleged occult means) of William Eglinton,\nwho was probably (after the Dr Slade brought into notoriety by\nProfessor ZoUner of Leipzig) the best known professional medium of\nhis day\u2014certainly the best known in England. The whole discus-\nsion may be said so far as the S.P.R. is concerned to have culminated\nin the demonstration by Mr S. J. Davey, an amateur conjurer, that\nhe could produce by purely conjuring skill phenomena similar to\nEglinton's and equally inexplicable to witnesses who described them.\nI thuik all unprejudiced persons who study the Proceedings and\nJournal of the time^ will agree that the results of our inquiry were\nfatal to the idea that Eglinton's performance afforded any evidence\nof the use of supernormal power. And this conclusion is supported by\nthe fact that he had on two previous occasions been detected in\ndeliberate fraud ; one when he was performing as medium and as\nmaterialised form at a materialisation seance ; and another in con-\nspiracy with Mme Blavatsky for the mysterious conveyance of a\nletter supposed to be sent by one of that lady's Mahatmas.\nThe publication of Mr Davey's \" demonstration \" is perhaps one\n^ See especially \" Accounts of some so-called Spiritualist Seances \" by Pro-\nfessor Carvill Lewis and others, Proceedi\u00bbgs, iv. .338; \"The Possibilities of\nMal-observation and Lapse of Memory from a Practical Point of View,\"\nIntroduction by Richard Hodgson, Proceedings, iv. 381 ; and \"Experimental\nInvestigation,\" by S.

Tliere are\ntwo dangers to be guarded against in estimating any experimental\nor indeed spontaneous evidence we may obtain concerning tbe sub-\njects we study. One is overestimating our powers of observation and\nmemory and the other underrating what chance can do and the\nallowance to be made for it. The first danger occurs chiefly in the\ncase of the physical phenomena of spiritualism, and Davey has proved\nthe fact and given us a measure of it.\nA similar demonstration as regards the physical phenomena\noccurring at sittings to-day, has been attempted on a somewhat\ndifferent plan by Mr Besterman and described in a paper read to the\nSociety this year.^\nColonel Taylor's paper on an\" Experimental Comparison between\nChance and Thought-Transference in Correspondence of Diagrams\n\"\nin Proceedings, vol. vi, is, I think, our first \" control experiment \" in\njudging the effect of chance coincidences, and the result was favour-\nable to telepathy. We have had several similar comparisons of\nchance and supposed supernormal faculty as regards, e.g. cross-\ncorrespondences and book-tests.\n2\nTo go back to 1884, Professor Barrett in that year visited Canada\nand the U.S.A. in connection with the Meeting of the British Associa-\ntion at Montreal. With his usual enthusiasm and energy he suc-\nceeded in creating some interest in psychical research, and addressed\nmeetings at Philadelphia, Boston and also Montreal. As a result an\nAmerican Society was formed in January 1885, Professor William\nJames being a leading member. In 1887 Dr Hodgson who had done\nso much in connection with the Blavatsky investigation, and with\nMr Davey, became its secretary and continued in that position, when\nin the same year the American Society on its own proposal was\nmerged with and became a Branch of the English Society. The com-\nbined societies workedharmoniously together till Dr Hodgson's sudden\ndeath in 1905, after which it was thought better that the American\nSociety should resume an independent existence, which it did under\nthe guidance of Professor Hyslop of Columbia University, New York.\nWhen Dr Hodgson became secretary to the American S.P.R. at\nBoston he almost immediately became interested, under the inspira-\ntion of Professor William James, in the trance mediumship of Mrs\nPiper. The study of this became his predominant interest and work for\n^ Theodore Besterman, \" Tlie Psychology of Testimony in relation to\nParaphysical Phenomena,\" Proceedmgs, vol. xl.\n^ See Miss H. de G. Verrall on \" The Element of Chance in Cross-Corres-\npondences \" Journal, xv. 183, xvi. 34 ; Mrs Sidgwick, \"A Note on Chance in\nBooktests \" Proceedings, xxxi. 379 ; an article on \" The Element of Chance in\nBook-tests \" Proceedings, xxxiii. 606 ; Theodore Besterman \" Further In-\nquiries into the Element of Chance in Book-tests \" Proceedings, vol. xl.

Mrs Piper allowed him to a great extent to manage\nher sittings for her and arrange who her sitters should be, and he was\nthus able to keep her trance utterances and her development under\nmore or less regular observation, A fuller record of trance medium-\nship has probably been published in the case of Mrs Piper than\nin that of any other trance medium. Beginning with Proceedings,\nvol. vi, there are ten papers, some of them very long, dealing pri-\nmarily with the exhibition in Mrs Piper's trance of knowledge\najjparently supernormally acquired, and four papers discussing the\npublished evidence. At the begmning of vol. xxviii is a descriptive\nlist of these fourteen papers. A fifteenth paper occupying the whole\nof vol. xxviii is intended to throw light on the working of her trance\nconsciousness from a psychological point of view. And in yet another\npaper in vol. xxxv Sir Trethewy carefully examines the question\nwhether the claim of the Imperator Band of Mrs Piper's Controls to\nbe the same as Mr Stainton Moses's Controls can be substantiated.\nHodgson died quite suddenly in December 1905, in the middle of a\ngame of ball, and his unexpected removal from our sphere was not\nonly a misfortune for our investigations generally, but especially so\nfrom the point of view of Mrs Piper's phenomena. For he is known\nto have had views about their interpretation which he intended to\nwrite about, but of which he left no record. We can only say that at\nthe time of his death he held to the conviction, slowly come to and\nexpressed in his second paper about her (vol. xiii), that there was\nthrough her, at times, communication with the dead.\nWe have been following Mrs Piper over many years of the Society's\nlife, and I must now return to the earlier days. Phantasms of the\nLivi'ng, by Gurney, Myers and Podmore, and especially Gurney,\nwhich sums up the most important results of the Society's earliest\nwork, was, as I have said, published in 1886. In July 1888\u2014the\nSociety's seventh year\u2014an irreparable loss befell it in Gurney's\ndeath, causing, as Sidgwick said in a Presidential Address on 16\nJuly 1888 {Proceedings, v. 271), a chasm between its past and its\nfuture work by \" depriving us of the colleague and friend who had so\nlarge a part in shaping the lines of this past ... I shall speak \" he\ncontinues, \" of '\nour '\nwork, but it will be present to your minds as to\nmine how largely this is the work of a vanished hand\u2014a hand whose\ncombined vigour and delicacy, and trained skill and indefatigable\nindustry, we must miss at every turn of the further labour that lies\nbefore us. , .\n.\" Gurney was really giving his life to psychical re-\nsearch, treating it as a whole time job. He was delightful to work\nwith, keenly interested practically and theoretically, and he brought\nto the work, as Myers says in an essay on him and his work {Proceed-\nings, V. 371), \" a temper of which the leading notes were disinterested-\nness, precision, sympathy.\"\n\f12 Mrs Henry Sidgwich [part\nGurney had been Honorary Secretary of the Society from 1883 on-\nwards and also Editor. Myers and Podmore now jointly undertook\nthe duties of the former position, and Sidgwick the Editorship.\nThe subject of mesmerism or hypnotism was, it will be remem-\nbered, one of those the Society set out to examine, and this, on the\npsychological side, Gurney had made his own. Some eight papers by\nhim concerned with hypnotism will be found in Proceedings, vols, ii,\niii, iv and v, and his work on the subject was original and much\nappreciated. I do not think Gurney hypnotised his subjects himself.\nCertainly he did not generally do so, but entrusted the actual hyp-\nnotising to Mr G. A. Smith (for some time his private secretary)\nwhile he himself directed and observed the experiments. Mr Smith,\nwhen we first knew him, used to give successful public entertain-\nments as a mesmerist, obtaining subjects by simply inviting people\nin the audience to come on to the platform to assist. He thus got\ninto touch with young men suitable both for Gurney's experiments\nin hypnotism, and for thought-transference experiments.\nEntertainments such as Mr Smith's were not uncommon in those\ndays, though now I think entirely abandoned, hypnotism being\nquite properly no longer regarded as a subject to play with. It is for-\ntunate, however, that in the eighties and early nineties, it was more\npossible through these entertainments than now to find healthy\npeople hypnotisable and available for telepathic experiments. With-\nout them I do not think we could have done as much as was done for\npsychical research, though whether hypnosis is in itself a condition\nfavourable to telepathic receptiveness, or whether it merely prevents\nboredom and inattention in a series of monotonous experiments, I do\nnot know.\nBefore the end of the last century hypnotism had passed from the\nhands of the S.P.R. to those of the medical profession, and we as a\nSociety have done little systematic work on it since then. It was of\ncourse, however, treated of by Myers in his book Human Personality,\nand we have published in Proceedings various interesting papers and\nreviews concerning it by, e.g. Dr Milne Bramwell in vol. xii and by Dr\nT. W. Mitchell in vol. xxiv.\nI think the so-called Census of Hallucinations may be regarded as\nthe next big piece of work undertaken under the auspices of the\nSociety. The authors of Phantasms of the Living had felt it necessary\nin arguing against the theory of chance-coincidence as an explana-\ntion of apparitions prima facie veridical, to try to estimate the pro-\nportion of the population which has the experience of seeing a recog-\nnised apparition and the proportion of these cases in which the ap-\nparition was veridical. In order to arrive at this Gurney himself\nattempted a census and succeeded in obtaining answers from about\n5700 persons as to whether they had ever seen an apparition. But since\n\f126] The Society for Psychical Research 13\nveridical apparitions are rare and 5700 was too small a number of\nanswers from which to draw inferences directly as to the proportion\nof apparitions which are veridical, Gurney had wished that a more\nextensive inquiry should be undertaken, and this was accordingly\nstarted in April 1889 (see Journal for April 1889). It was sanguinely\nhoped by the promoters of this efiort that 50,000 answers might be\nobtained. But statistical investigations of this kind are more\ndifficult and more laborious than the committee had realised, and in\nthe end owing to the reluctance of some to undertake the trouble of\ncollecting and of others to give information, they had to be content\nwith 17,000 answers collected by 410 collectors.\nIn August 1889 there was an International Congress of Experi-\nmental Psychology at Paris, under the Presidency of Professor Ribot\nand with Professor Richet as secretary, in which Members of the\nS.P.R. took part. The Congress interested itself in the proposed\ncensus, and under its influence it was decided to widen the scope of the\ninquiry and bring out other facts which the investigation might\nreveal about hallucinations, besides the numerical relation between\nthose that are veridical and those that are not. It was also decided\nthat the inquiry should be international, and Sidgwick was charged\nby the Congress with the general superintendence of the investiga-\ntion.\nIn 1892 there was again a Congress of Experimental Psychology,\nheld this time in London, and to this Congress Sidgwick was able to\npresent in an abridged form part of the report on the results of the\ncensus. But it was not till 1894 that the final and complete report\ncould be published in Proceedings, where it occupied the greater part\nof vol. X. The cause of delay will be appreciated when it is remem-\nbered that among the 17,000 answers to the census question, 2,272\nwere in the affirmative, and that each of these afiirmative answers\nhad to be scrutinised as carefully as possible, and a large proportion\nof the informants and collectors corresponded with and interviewed\nconcerning them. A good deal was also done in comparing census\ncases with experiences otherwise brought to our notice. I venture to\nthink that any one interested in hallucinations, veridical or other-\nwise, will find the report well worth study. I need hardly add, that\nthe conclusion already arrived at in Phantasms of the Living, \" that\nbetween deaths and apparitions of the dying person a connection\nexists which is not due to chance alone \" is fully confirmed.\nIt was in 1897 {Proceedings, vol. xui) that Sir William Barrett\npublished the first part of his study on the so-called divining-rod\n\u2014\nthe discovery of underground water and metals, etc., by dowsing.\nThe second part followed in Proceedings, vol. xv. There had been\ninteresting papers on the subject in volume ii by Professor W. J.\nSollas (as a geologist) and by Mr E. R. Pease and Mr E. Vaughan\n\f14 Mrs Henry Sidgivich [part\nJenkins, but Barrett's two papers give a comprehensive account of\nthe subject historically, experimentally and practically. He does\nnot profess to have as yet furnished a complete explanation of the\nprocess from a psychical point of view, though he inclines to think\nthat the dowser acquires by clairvoyance his knowledge of the\nsituation of the water sought. At the end of his life\u2014he died in\nMay 1925\u2014he revised, with the assistance of Mr Theodore Bester-\nman, the substance of these two papers, which, with additional\nmatter, were published after his death in a book entitled The Divin-\ning-Rod : an Experimental and Psychological Investigation, London\n1926. His interest in psychical research was widespread, and some-\nthing from his pen may be found in our Proceedings concerning almost\nevery class of subject that the Society has investigated, but it was\ndowsing to which he had, I think, devoted most time and attention,\nmaking the subject his own, and to the end he retained the view that\nclairvoyance of some sort was probably the explanation.\nThe turn of the century was a sad epoch for the Society owing to\nthe death in August 1900 of Henry Sidgwick, its first President and\nconstant leader and adviser, and the death in January 1901 of\nFrederic Myers, its honorary secretary and its President at the time\nof his death. Myers's zeal and energy, his remarkable powers of\nexposition and readiness in speech, had been an invaluable asset to\nthe Society, never replaced. He had the subjects of our investiga-\ntion so thoroughly in his mind, and I may say at his finger ends, that\nhe could at a moment's notice give an interesting discourse on almost\nany department of our work. The main results of his studies have,\nof course, been published in his book Human Personality and its Sur-\nvival of Bodily Death, which fortunately he left in an advanced state\nfor publication. There was, however, still a good deal to do in detail,\nand the book did not actually appear before 1903. When it did it\nmade a greater impression on the public than probably anything\nhitherto published in our subject had done. The first edition of\n1,000 copieswas exhausted, I believe, within a week or two of publica-\ntion, and it undoubtedly gave a great impetus to our work.^\nMyers's work as honorary secretary was carried on with energy and\nefficiency by his fellow honorary-secretary, Mr J. G. Piddington.\nMiss Alice Johnson had been Editor of Proceedings and Journal from\nJune 1899, and with their help the Society passed safely through the\ncrisis.\nBut it was most fortunate for us that Sir Oliver Lodge at that\ncritical moment consented to accept the Presidency, which he re-\n1 Recently a Myers Memorial Lecture has been subscribed for and instituted\nin honour of Myers. Its endowment enables the Council to arrange for a lec-\nture periodically, and from time to time to make grants for research work in\nconnection with it (see Journal, xxvii. 21-2).\n\f126] Thk'^&hc%'s^yl\\fpy\/P,QycMcdly 15\ntained for three years.

She had psychic powers and was a trance medium, in\nsome respects like Mrs Piper, but never a professional medium.\nBeing interested, however, in spiritualism, she was willing to give\nsittings for investigation to suitable persons personally introduced to\nher, and some of their records are published in Proceedings, vol. xvii,\nwhere may be found papers by six different witnesses^ with an intro-\nductory one by Sir Oliver Lodge. A further long and important\npaper by Mr Piddington \" On the Types of Phenomena displayed in\nMrs Thompson's Trance \" will be found in Proceedings, vol. xviii.\nThese papers are a valuable contribution to any study of trance-\nmediumship.\nIt was a few weeks after Myers's death that Mrs A. W. Verrall suc-\nceeded in cultivating in herself the power of automatic writing, in\nwhich she had previously failed. An account by herself of her devel-\nopment of automatism up to the end of 1904 and her relations to\nother automatists occupies the whole of Proceedings, vol. xx. Mrs\nVerrall's success was followed by that of others who with her formed,\nfrom the investigator's point of view, a sort of group. There was her\ndaughter, now Mrs W. H. Salter ; there was for a short time Mrs\n\" Forbes \" (pseudonym) a friend of hers and of Myers ; Mrs Holland\n(pseudonym) who had not known Myers or his friends, but whose\ninterest in the subject had been stirred by his book Human Per-\nsonality and who put herself into communication with Miss Alice\nJohnson, then secretary of the Society ; Mrs Willett (pseudonym),\na very important member of the group, and also the \" Macs\n\"\n(pseudonym), strangers to us all, who had been obtaining automatic\nscript on their own account and were drawn into the group in 1908\nthrough reading Miss Johnson's first report on Mrs Holland's\nscript in Proceedings, vol. xxi. This induced a change in the\ncharacter of their own script, which then instructed them to send\nit to Mrs Verrall, whom they did not know. After a little hesita-\ntion they did so, with striking results (see Proceedings, vol. xxix).\nMrs Wilson came into the group through trying telepathic experi-\nments with Miss Verrall. Then in 1912 Mrs \" King \" (pseudonym\nfor Dame Edith Lyttelton) developed automatism after the death\nof her husband, the Right Hon. Alfred Lyttelton, and a little\nlater one or two others also joined. Joined, however, is hardly\nthe right word, for the group has no cohesion. The members of it\n^ Myers, Dr F. van Eeden, Mr Piddington, Hodgson, Miss Alice Johnson,\nMrs A. W. Verrall.\n\f1 6 : \/Mf'f_Ee:kiii\/ -Sidc^wiQ^\n'\n.\"Ci;\n[part\ndo not all know each, other, nor have they met as a group.

With a recorder\npresent the automatic communication is sometimes spoken instead\nof written.\nIt was noticed very shortly by the uivestigators that a sort of tele-\npathic connection seemed to exist between the scripts of the group\n\u2014\na tendency to refer independently to the same topic either literally or\ncryptically. This we speak of as cross-correspondence. Of course\ncare was taken that members of the group should not see each other's\nscripts, or that when, for any reason they did, an exact record should\nas far as possible be kept of what each had seen. The general effect\nproduced by study of these scripts is that some intelligence behind\nthe communications is acting by design and to some extent inspires\nthe scripts though not always able to avoid confusion. The\nsupposed communicator when named, as he often is in the earlier\nyears of these scripts, is usually Myers or Gurney, though other\nnames appear.\nUnfortunately much of the contents of these scripts is too private\nfor present publication, but a good deal has been published and may\nbe studied in one or more papers in each of the following volumes of\nProceedings : xx, xxi, xxii, xxiv, xxv, xxvi, xxvii, xxix, xxxiii, xxxvi.\nAmong these papers are to be found general reports on the scripts\nof some of the automatists in question, particular instances of cross-\ncorrespondence (including experimental attempts at cross-corres-\npondence between the group and Mrs Piper), also reports on com-\nmunication on special subjects, as \" Some Recent Scripts affording\nEvidence of Personal Survival \" in vol. xxvii ;\n\" The Ear of Diony-\nsius \" in vol. xxix ;\n\" Forecasts in Scripts concerning the War,\" vol.\nxxxiii ;\n\" One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life \" and \" The Master\nBuilder,\" both these last in vol. xxxvi. These scripts are very full of\nliterary allusions, the writers being cultivated persons with strong\nliterary interests. All the members of the group make a practice of\nsending their scripts to Mr Gerald Balfour or Mr Piddington, by\nwhom they are carefully studied and annotated and preserved.\nOf late years the rate of reception and number received has much\ndiminished. Mrs Verrall, from whom many scripts came, died in\n1916, and other members of the group have ceased writing auto-\nmatically. Others write but seldom, though the receipt of further\nscripts from them, even after long intervals, would not surprise the\ninvestigators. The evidence from the whole set of scripts of this\ngroup on the side of survival and of communication at times between\nthe living and the dead, is certainly strong\u2014I think the strongest we\nhave published. I believe this is felt by all who have studied them\n\f126] The Society for Psychical Research 17\nwith care. But it would be stronger for the public if we could pub-\nlish the whole.\nWe have another automatist among our workers\u2014Mr S. G.

Of this a review entitled\n\" The Oscar Wilde Scripts \" will be found in Proceedings, vol. xxxiv.\nTo return to trance mediums. The last I spoke of at any length\nwas Mrs Thompson. More recently much study has been given to the\nmediumship of Mrs Osborne Leonard and various papers on the sub-\nject have been published by the S.P.R. The first paper published\nwas an important study and record of a series of sittings with her by\nMiss Radclyffe Hall and Una, Lady Troubridge, in Proceedings, vol.\nXXX. There have been further general reports on sittings with her in\nvols, xxxii and xxxvi by Mrs Salter. There have also been papers\nconcerning her on \" The Modus Operandi in Mediumistic Trance \" by\nUna, Lady Troubridge in Proceedings, vols, xxxii and xxxiv and by\nMr Drayton Thomas in vol. xxxviii, and on \" Some Licidents at\nSittings with Mrs Leonard which may throw light on the modus\noperandi \" by Mrs Salter, Proceedings, vol. xxxix.\nThere has also been a good deal of investigation as to the evidence\nfor book-tests, which are rather a speciality of Mrs Leonard's medium-\nship. In a typical book-test the Communicator will tell the sitter to\nlook on a specified page of a book, in a particular place on a certain\nshelf in a room, perhaps unknown to either medium or sitter, and\nthen to find a reference to some specified subject. If this turns out\nto be correct and the coincidence is not clue to chance, it would seem\nto afford evidence of knowledge acquired neither through the senses\nnor telepathically, but clairvoyantly. This is important, as definite\nevidence of the reality of clairvoyance has hitherto been scanty. Un-\nfortunately the book-tests given do not always turn out to be fully or\neven partially correct, and they are apt to exhibit a certain vague-\nness which makes it difficult to estimate their value, especially as the\nprobability of success cannot be calculated with exactness as in the\ncase of the guessing of cards or numbers. An examination of book-\ntests (by me) appears in Proceedings, vol. xxxi, and as already said\n(p. 10 footnote) two papers on the \" Element of Chance in Book-\ntests \" have appeared in vols, xxxiii and xl. The last of these, by\nMr Theodore Besterman, is the more extensive and ambitious, but\nboth bring out a result against chance-coincidence being a sufficient\nexplanation of Mrs Leonard's book-tests.\nB\n\f18 Mrs Henry Sidgwick [part\nIn Proceedings, vol. xxxv, is an important report sent to us by\nMr S. G. Soal, on a series of communications received by him through\na professional medium, Mrs Blanche Cooper, with whom he had\nsittings at the British College for Psychic Science. An interesting\nfeature in this series is that one of the alleged Communicators, an old\nschoolfellow of Mr Soal's, communicating as a dead man, proved\nafterwards to have been alive all the time, though entirely uncon-\nscious of any communication. Moreover at the seances veridical\nstatements were made concerning this gentleman's past, his present,\nand even his future, e.g. the arrangement of a house not then in his\npossession. There are other interesting experiments and observa-\ntions described by Mr Soal in the course of this paper.\nA series of 142 sittings were held under arrangements made by the\nSociety with another trance medium, Mrs Warren Elliott in 1926, and\nwere reported on by Mr H. F. Saltmarsh in Proceedings, vol. xxxix.\n\" The Primary object of the experiment was to attempt to throw\nlight on the psychological mechanism of trance mediumship.\" The\nreport is of great interest, and for the possibility of carrying the\nexperiment through, the Society owes gratitude not only to a generous\nanonymous donor, but to Mrs Warren Elliott herself for her willing\nco-operation. In the course of the experiment sittings were held with\na view to eliciting communications for various particular persons who\nwere not however present and were not aware that the sitting was\ntaking place. No one was present except the medium and a note-\ntaker. To make a link with the absent sitter, an object belonging to\nhim or her was brought by the notetaker, who, however, was unaware\nto whom it belonged. The possibility of direct thought-transference\nwith anyone present was thus eliminated.\nIn this connection \" The Tony Burman case \" by Miss Nea Walker,\nalso in Proceedings, vol. xxxix, should be considered.\nAmong the departments of psychical research which in 1882 our\nSociety proposed to investigate, that of the physical phenomena of\nspiritualism is the one as to which, notwithstanding repeated efforts,\nleast evidence of genuineness has, as it seems to me, been found in this\nor in any other country. But I must briefly refer to our experience in\nthis department. I have already mentioned the evidence obtained in\nthe early days of the Society concerning Eglinton, the slate-writing\nmedium, and the conclusion that his performances were tricks.\nIn 1891 we became acquainted with a gentleman\u2014a near relation\nof friends of some of us\u2014who professed to be able to levitate tables\nwithout touching them except on the upper surface. We took a good\ndeal of trouble about the case, which ultimately proved to be one of\npure deception throughout. The supposed medium was a professional\nman in a good position and there was no pecuniary motive to deceive.\nI fancy it amused him at first. Sidgwick gave an account of the\n\f126] The Society for Psychical Research 19\ncase at a meeting of the Society in 1894 under the title \" Disinterested\nDeception \", which is printed in the Journal, vi. 275.\nDeception by friends and acquaintances is of course peculiarly\npainful, but apart from cases of the \" poltergeist \" order where the\nperformers are often children and sometimes not quite normal ones,\nwe have not encountered much trickery^ in the course of our investi-\ngations except with professional mediums for physical phenomena,\namong whom it is unfortunately common. Several cases of detec-\ntion have been recorded in the Journal. See Journal, xii (1905-6), for\nexposures of Chambers, of Craddock and of Eldred ;\nJournal, xiv, for\nexposure of Carancini\u2014an Italian medium whom we invited to this\ncountry for investigation ; and Journal, xv, for an exposure at our\nRooms of Charles Bailey, an Australian medium. Mr Everard\nFeilding, in Journal, xii. 162, described under the title \" The Haunted\nSolicitor, an unfinished comedy \", a case which he carefully examined\non the spot and spent considerable time over, and afterwards re-\nported at a meeting of the Society. He classes it as a poltergeist case,\nbut grown-up people were concerned and trickery and conspiracy\nthere certainly were.\n\" A Report on Various Spiritualist Phenomena \" by the late\nLieut-Colonel Taylor, for long a Member of the S.P.R. Council, was\ncontributed by him to Proceedings, vol. xix. It is an account of six\nincidents at sittings between 1884 and 1904 of which four include\nraps or movements of objects. They are selected from his own ex-\nperiences and were regarded by him as genuine, and the account is\nbased on notes written by him within a few hours of the incidents.\nColonel Taylor, who died in 1911, was a good observer, and this\nreport, like the first report by Mr Feilding and Mr Baggally on\nEusapia Palladino to which I am about to refer, must weigh on the\npositive side for the genuineness of some physical phenomena of\nspiritualism.\nIn 1906 Miss Alice Johnson, then our Research Officer, visited\nDenver in the U.S.A. at the invitation of Dr Gower, a member of the\nSociety, who resided there, in order to have a series of sittings in a\nprivate circle of friends of his, who received her most hospitably.\nThe phenomena, movements of tables without apparent contact\nand raps, which she witnessed were interesting and striking, but\nless so, in Dr Gower's view, than what he had witnessed with the\nsame friends in previous years. Miss Johnson unfortunately did not\n^ There was one case published in Phantasms of the Living later discovered to\nhave been fictitious (see Proceedings, vol. xiv 14). There is also a rather heart-\nless and elaborate case of fictitioiis messages in a private circle (see Journal,\nxxi 306) under the title \" A Fictitious Communicator.\" The case was reported\nto us, and members of our staff were able to assist the victims to discover and\nexpose the deception.\n\f20 Mrs Henry Sidgivick [part\nwitness them under what seemed to her crucial conditions. She \u2022\nbelieved in the honest intentions of all concerned, but in conclusion\ncould only say that it appeared to her \" impossible to form any\ndecided judgment on the facts . . . and unprofitable to speculate\nfurther about them till we can obtain more decisive evidence one\nway or the other \". For her report on the whole case see Proceed-\nings, vol. xxi. 94.\nIn 1894 Eusapia Palladino was a leading medium on the continent,\nespecially for telekinesis. Professor Richet invited Sir Oliver Lodge\nand Myers to meet her at his house in the south of France, and Sir\nOliver obtained phenomena (described in the Journal, vol. vi) in\ncircumstances which convinced him they were genuine, and I think\nhe has never wavered since. Professor Sidgwick and I joined the\nparty later and what we witnessed was certainly remarkable, though\nthere were suspicious circumstances. Myers invited Eusapia to\nCambridge for a series of sittings in 1895, but practically all that\nhappened at these was detected as trickery (see Journal, vol. vii),\nand for a time we experimented no more with her.\nSidgwick, all the time he had to do with the Society, took the view\nthat if a medium were found consciously tricking no further investi-\ngation with him or her should take place, its continuance being a\ndirect encouragement to fraud and a hindrance to progress in re-\nsearch. However, this view was not shared by all Members of the\nCouncil, and reports of Eusapia from abroad continuing favourable,\na Committee consisting of Mr Everard Feilding and Mr Baggally\n(both Members of the S.P.R. Council), and Mr Carrington (officially\nconnected with the American Society) was sent in 1908 to Naples,\nwhere Eusapia lived, to look into the matter again. They had a\nseries of sittings under what they considered very satisfactory con-\nditions. Their favourable and able report was published in Proceed-\nings, vol. xxiii. Unfortunately for Eusapia's reputation, however,\nsome further sittings conducted by Mr Feilding and others at Naples\nin 1910 were again apparently pure trickery (see Proceedings,\nvol. xxv).\nIn 1920 an attempt was made to get satisfactory evidence with\n\"\nthe celebrated French materialising medium called Eva C. (otherwise\nMarthe Beraud). She and the lady with whom she lived, Mme Bisson,\nwere invited to London by the Society, and she gave us a series of\nforty sittings, reported on in Proceedings, vol. xxxii. (An account of\nthe previous history of Marthe Beraud based on the many published\nreports of her materialisations, etc., was compiled by Mrs Salter, then\nMiss Verrall, and published in Proceedings, vol. xxvii). The Society's\nown investigations were unfortunately inconclusive. The pheno-\nmena observed were, so the investigating committee reported, \" few\nin number and poor in quality \", and, they say, \" If we had not been\n\f126] The Society for Psychical Research 21\nacquainted with tlie work of previous investigators\/ we might have\nfelt inclined to di-aw negative conclusions from our own observa-\ntions \" (Proceedings, vol. xxxii 332).\nIn the Journal, xx, is the report received from Mr Harry Price\nof his well-known experiment with Mr Hope the \" spirit-photogra-\npher \" at a sitting held at the British College of Psychic Science. An\noutcome of this and of the discussion that followed, was the offer by\nMr H. W.Pugh in June 1922, to contribute \u00a3100 towards an investiga-\ntion by the Society of Mr Hope under conditions laid down by him\n(Mr Pugh). Mr Hope and his coadjutor, Mrs Buxton (called \" the\nCrewe circle \") consented. All seemed satisfactorily arranged. Mr\nHope's representatives on the investigatiug committee had been\nselected and an agreement drawn up and signed by them, when the\nCrewe circle withdrew from the arrangements and the investigation\ntherefore never took place (see Journal, xxi. 111.)\nIn 1924 the Austrian medium, AVilly Schneider, was invited to\nLondon and gave twelve sittings for telekinetic phenomena, under\nthe management of Dr WooUey and Mr Dingwall, in the S.P.R.\nseance-room. They were reported on by Mr Dingwall in Proceedings,\nvol. xxxvi. . Phenomena occurred at eight of the twelve sittings,\nsome of which, though they were inferior ia quality to those pre-\nviously witnessed by Mr Dingwall in Dr von Schrenck-Notzmg's\nlaboratory at Munich {Proceedings, xxxvi. 33), impressed the experi-\nmenters as normally inexplicable.\nAnother investigation of physical phenomena carried out in our\nseance-room by Dr WooUey and Mr Dingwall was with Mr Janus\nFronczek of Poland. The report on this is also published in Proceed-\nings, vol. xxxvi, and must be regarded as negative. I need not here\ngo iato details.\nIn the winter of 1924-25, Mr Dingwall went to Boston, U.S.A., for\nthe purpose of having a series of sittings with Mrs Crandon {Mar-\ngery) . His going was generously facilitated by Mrs Augustus Hemen-\nway of Boston. He had twenty-nine sittings, carefully described in\nhis report in Proceedings, vol. xxxvi. His failure, however, to obtain\nphenomena under conditions as good, in his opinion, as those ob-\ntained, e.g. in the case of Willy Schneider, evidently left him with\ngrave doubts as to the genuineness of the performance {Proceedings,\nxxxvi. 153).^\n1 [Recent disclosures, it must be remarked, have made it appear that less\nweight can be attached to the work of these investigators than was thought at\nthe time this report was pubhshed.]\n2 A propos of this it may be mentioned that in 1929 Dr Crandon borrowed our\nseance-ioom. for purposes of demonstration of some of Margery's phenomena.\nOur honorary research officer, Dr WooUey, attended the demonstrations as an\nobserver onlj-. It was proposed to obtain finger prints in dental wax of\n\f22 Mrs Henry Sidgwick [part\nIn 1928 Mr Besterman undertook a four months' tour chiefly in\ncentral Europe, largely financed by an anonymous donor, for the\npurpose of observing mediums and making acquaintance with\ninvestigators. His report will be found in Proceedings, xxxviii.\n409-80. Among the fourteen mediums or psychics on whom he re-\nported several professed to be mediums for physical phenomena, but\nof these he only had the opportunity of observing sufficiently to\nreport in the case of three\u2014two mediums at Budapest and the well-\nknown Frau Maria Silbert of Graz\u2014and unfortunately in each case\nwhat he observed seemed definitely to prove trickery.\nI think this completes the list of investigations into the physical\nphenomena of spiritualism which have been described in our Pro-\nceedings or Journal. But of course there have been other attempts\nby members of the Council or offi.cers of the Society, or others, too\ninconclusive or futile to be worth printing accounts of. I do not\nwish to give the impression that everything we hear about is pub-\nlished. I am afraid that as it is many will feel that the time, trouble\nand expense involved in examining this class of phenomena has left\nus very much in the same position regarding it as we were fifty years\nago. There are now, as there were then, a few observations recorded\nwhere it is difficult to believe that the investigators were deceived,\nand many where deception or the attempt to deceive is practically\ncertain. The methods now employed by mediums for physical\nphenomena are no doubt somewhat different from what they were in\nthe early days of the Society, but any change is not, I think, in the\ndirection of making satisfactory investigation easier.\nA laborious line of investigation to which much time and trouble\nhas recently been devoted, is what we may call mass-experiments\u2014\nintended in the first place to discover whether such psychic faculties\nas telepathy and clairvoyance are at all widely distributed in however\nslight a degree, and in the second place possibly to reveal good per-\ncipients.\nAn experiment of this kind in telepathy was made by Dr WooUey\nwith the kind assistance of the B.B.C. on 16 February 1927, and is\ndescribed in Proceedings, vol. xxxviii under the title \" The Broad-\ncasting Experiment in Mass Telepathy \". He assembled a small\ngroup of agents at the Society's office who endeavoured to transmit\ntelepathically ideas and images selected by him, and listeners-in\nwere asked to record what ideas came to them, and post the record to\ndeceased or absent persons. Margery^ s forearms were bound to her chair by a\nmethod carefully described, but Dr Woolley's observation, and subsequent\nexperiments with Mrs Brackenbury acting the part of medium, showed that\nthe method of controlling the arms used was less effective than it was supposed\nto be, and in fact would not have prevented the handling by the medium of\nobjects on the table {Proceedings, xxxix. 359 \u00a3F.).\n\f126] The Society for Psychical Research 23\nthe Society. Sir Oliver Lodge acted frora the B.B.C. office as announ-\ncer to inform the listeners when each attempt at transmission was\nbeginning. The number of items which the agents endeavoured to\ntransmit was five, looked at successively at intervals of five minutes.\nThe number of listeners who sent in reports of their impressions was\n24,650. Unfortunately the result must, on the whole, be regarded as\nnegative\u2014that is as not furnishing evidence of widespread telepathic\nfaculty under the given conditions. It has, however, revealed some\ninteresting results from a psychological point of view, e.g. as regards\nnumber habits.\nWhat may be regarded as a continuation of the \" broadcasting\n\"\nexperiment has been carried out by Mr S. G. Soal (see \" Experiments\nin Supernormal Perception at a Distance \", Proceedings, vol. xl)\nassisted by Mr and Mrs Fernald, Professor and Mrs Mackenzie, Mr\nOdell, Miss Carruthers and others too numerous to be named here.\nTo begin with, he selected those who seemed most promising as per-\ncipients among those who had sent in replies in the broadcasting\nexperiment. For these experiments and a discussion of various pre-\nvious experiments, see Part I of Mr Soal's paper. After this first year\nof experiment he decided to widen the scope and succeeded in arrang-\ning to work with some 579 percipients. \" No such body of perci-\npients has ever in the history of psychical research taken part in\nexperiments extending over such a prolonged period as six months,\"\nMr Soal tells us. The subjects to be transferred were now more-\nover limited to material adapted to statistical computation. Un-\nfortunately, though in both parts of Mr Soal's experiments there was\na small residuum of results suggestive of supernormality, the coinci-\ndences obtained were not sufficiently striking or detailed to compel\nbelief in the operation of a supernormal faculty. Investigations\nof this kind are very laborious and time-taking, and it is therefore\nthe more disappointing that the result of the inquiry should be\nnegative. It must not be supposed, however, that the work done\nis useless. The negative answer to the inquiry is itself of course of\ngreat importance, and Mr Soal's careful study and analysis suggest\nvarious points of psychological interest.\nMiss Ina Jephson has attempted similar mass experiments in\nclairvoyance and published an interesting paper on them in Pro-\nceedings, vol. xxxviii. There appeared to be some success, but as\nshe is carrying the experiments further under different conditions I\nneed not go into particulars now.\nReports of experiments such as these do not provide light reading\nor thrillmg sensations ; but they are obviously of great importance\nbecause of the light they throw, or may throw, on the problems be-\nfore us\u2014and much more light than we yet have is required before we\ncan claim to understand, e.g. either telepathy or clairvoyance, and\n\f24 Mrs Henry Sidgwick [part\nthe conditions under which they occur. If knowledge reaches an\nautoiuatist (or shall we say more generally a sensitive ?) supernor-\nmally, how and whence does it come ? We have made some pro-\ngress. We have, I thinlv, convinced most of those who have really\nstudied the evidence we have collected, that telepathy exists. That\nis a very big step. But it may be a long time before we can decisively\ntake the next step, whatever that may be, and in the meanwhile we\ncan only go on examining and analysing any facts and experiences,\nspontaneous or experimental, that come our way, and be cautious in\nadopting hasty assumptions to explain them. There is comparatively\nlittle of theory in our publications so far, and general philosophical\nspeculation is, I think, almost confined to some of our Presidential\nAddresses.\nWe are proud of our Presidents and have been fortunate in the\nmen who have honoured our Society by presiding over it. I will not\ngive a complete list but may say that besides those I have already\nmentioned as founders, we have had Professor Balfour Stewart\nF.R.S., the late Lord Rayleigh, O.M., F.R.S., Sir William Crookes,\nO.M., F.R.S., Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S.\u2014all distinguished in physical\nscience ;\nthe late Earl of Balfour, K.G., O.M., Professor William\nJames, Professor Henri Bergson, and Dr F. C. S. Schiller among\nphilosophers ; Professor Charles Richet, and Professor Hans Driesch\namong biologists ; and Professor William James, Dr William Mc-\nDougall and Dr T. W. Mitchell among psychologists. And as many\nothers important in various ways and all helpful in our work and\ninterested in the Society. All the Addresses they delivered will be\nfound in our Proceedings.\nIt will be realised by anyone conversant with our Proceedings and\nJournal that in this brief account of the history and activities of the\nS.P.R. I have given a general sketch rather than any complete\nstory. Thus I have omitted mention of many important workers\nand important papers.\n^\n1 For instance I have said nothing about crystal-gazing\u2014an important sub-\nject because it appears to be, with some people, a ready method of inducing\nhallucinatory visions which may turn out to be telepathic or clairvoyant (see a\npaper by Miss X, Rliss Goodrich Freer, Proceedings, vol. v and other references,\nespecially by Andi-ew Lang). Nor again have I referred to phenomena of\nMultiple Personahty (see the Ansel Bourne case by Hodgson, Proceedings, voL\nvu ;\na paper by Dr Morton Prince, Proceedings, vol. xv and by Dr T. W.\nMitchell, Proceedings, vol. xxvi). The subject of the \" Appreciation of Time\nby Somnambules \" experimented on by Professor Delboeuf and Dr T. W.\nMitchell {Proceedings, vol. xxi) and others, is also interesting. And I have not\nmentioned Mr A. T. Fryer's account of the Welsh Revival {Proceedings, vol.\nxix) nor a study of dreams by Dr F. van Eeden {Proceedings, vol. xxvi) and\npapers by others on this subject, and by Mrs Leaning {Proceedings, vol. xxxv)\non hypnagogic phenomena. And there are other important papers, long and\nshort, in Proceediiigs and Journal which might have been mentioned. I^ave\n\f126] The Society for Psychical Research 25\nMy reason for such omissions is merely tliat one cannot within\nreasonable bounds call attention to everything, and my selection has\nbeen roughly guided by the list of subjects for investigation published\nin our early circulars. Nor do I profess even within that list of topics\nto have called attention to all that we have published . I shall feel\nthat it has been worth while compiling this summary if it should lead\nany one interested in our subjects to explore the information and\ndiscussion concerning them to be found in our Journal and Proceed-\nings, and especially if it should lead to any one pursuing any branch\nof investigation further. I think I may say without boasting that\nour Proceedings will stand examination. The reader will very seldom\nfind that a statement or judgment has been published which after-\nwards has had to be withdrawn ; for we have always tried to be care-\nful and cautious both in accepting facts and drawing inferences, and\nhave endeavoured to make each step secure as we go along. Of\ncourse similar care is wanted in all scientific work, but ours has\nspecial difficulties of its own. We are pioneers sailing as it were on an\nuncharted sea and liable at any moment to come on hidden difficul-\nties and obstacles. And one of these is the apparent rarity of the\nhuman subjects who possess the psychic faculties we are trying to\ninvestigate. This makes it very difiicult to repeat observations or\nexperiments as much as is required to confirm them and to enable us\nto understand them better than we do.\nMy friends tell me that I ought not to end my tale without saymg\nwhat impression this retrospective survey of the Society's fifty years\nof life and work\u2014work in which I have shared\u2014produces on my own\nmind. I may say at once without hesitation that I feel now as I felt\nwhen I first engaged in it, before the foundation of the Society, that\nours is some of the most important work in which we can engage for\nthe extension of knowledge and the benefit of mankind. And it is\nwork in which the support and help of the Society has been and is of\ngreat value, for it acts as a centre through which interest in the sub-\nject may spread and knowledge of it accimiulate. Some 'complain\nthat our progress is slow. The term is relative and we can certainly\nimagine progress quicker, but whether we ever had reason to expect\nit to be quicker considering the obstacles that beset investigation is\nanother question.\nI think it is probable that if more people of sense and intelligence\ntried what they can do, more cases of psychic faculty, e.g. telepathy,\nmight be observed, and more learnt about conditions favourable to\nit. There are indications, I thmk, that telepathy is, as it were, the\nalso not mentioned a number of papers and reports relating to alleged super-\nnormal phenomena among Eastern and uncivilized peoples ; a list of these is\ngiven in Proceedings, xxxviii. 222.\n\f26 Mrs Henry Sidgwick [part 126]\nkey, or a key, to other branches of our research. If for instance there\nis, as I believe, occasional communication of an evidential kind\nbetween the living and the dead\u2014and some good evidence supporting\nthis has been published in our Proceedings\u2014it is probably telepathic.\nClairvoyance again\u2014that is perception of material objects other-\nwise than through the senses\u2014is thought by some to be probably akin\nto telepathy ;\nand of the existence of clairvoyance evidence also\nseems to be accumulating. If I may be allowed to prophesy, I should\nsay that with patience and perseverance\u2014and little good work has\nbeen done in the world without these two qualities\u2014we shall add to\nthe evidence in at least these three departments, namely telepathy\nbetween the living (established in my opinion as a fact though there\nis still much to learn about it), communication with the dead, and\nclairvoyance, and probably in others.\nAnd I look to our Society to continue this work with coiirage and\nhope, undismayed by the difficulties in the way of progress. If it is\ncontinued in the same spirit in which the S.P.R. has so far carried it\non, valuable success will, I feel sure, be its reward.\nAfter reading the above paper Lord Balfour added : That con-\ncludes the Address of your President of Honour. May I be allowed,\nbefore we separate, to add one or two sentences of my own 1 Some\nof you may have felt that the note of caution and reserve has pos-\nsibly been over-emphasised in Mrs Sidgwick \"s paper. If so, they\nmay be glad to hear what I am about to say. Conclusive proof of\nsurvival is notoriously difficult to obtain. But the evidence may\nbe such as to produce belief, even though it fall short of conclusive\nproof. I have Mrs Sidgwick's assurance\u2014an assurance which I am\npermitted to convey to the meeting\u2014that, upon the evidence before\nher, she herself is a firm believer both in survival and in the reality\nof communication between the living and the dead.\"\n\fAPPENDIX\nCLASSIFIED LIST OF THE CONTENTS OF THE SOCIETY'S\nPROCEEDINGS AND JOURNAL TO JUNE 1932\nThe scope of psychical research is too undefined to allow of a strictly\nlogical classification.

For it is well\nknown that an organism has to make changes so as to correspond\nwith and adapt itself to its new environment if the circumstances\nof that environment are modified. I was not actually an original\nmember of the Society, but had been acquainted with its Foimders\nbefore its initiation, and heard some of the preliminary discussions\nabout it. The conditions in which it took its origin were in many\nrespects much more difficult than they are now. The Foimders had\nto encounter not only hostility, but a good deal of ridicule. Its\nobjects, however, as specified by Henry Sidgwick, were so entirely\nsane and cautious as to make ridicule quite inappropriate. Htunour\nof that kind was entirely wasted, and was only based on complete\nignorance of the scheme. But hostilitv was more serious, and some\nof it has persisted to the present day. The most serious kind of\nhostility was based not on ignorance but on disapproval, disapproval\nof the slow and cautious procedure and of the stringent criticism to\nwhich all narratives were subjected before they were accepted for\npublication. From its early days there were, among the members,\nsome who were already convinced about many of the phenomena,\nand who urged that so extremely cautious and dubious an attitude\nwas inconsistent with facts already known and tested, and that\nthe Society might proceed more rapidly to accept these as estab-\nlished. The names of Alfred Russel Wallace and Stainton Moses\nwere prominent among those who had already been convinced of the\ngenuineness of certain extraordinary phenomena, either by a study\nof the evidence or by their own first-hand experience, and they\nshowed a certain amount of impatience at the cautious and critical\nattitude of the Founders. They urged that we were excluding or\nrefusing to accept a number of events which were actually taking\nplace, and were neglecting to study them for lack of sufficient and\ncimiulative e\\'idence. And some of them broke away from the\nE\n^ Read at a General Meeting of the Society, 29 June 1932.\n61\n\f62 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nSociety on that account. This attitude of impatience has continued\nto our own day, so that our Society has been called a Society for the\nSuppression of Psychical Eesearch.\nWhile sympathising with these objectors to some extent, I hold\nthat the policy of the Founders, which has been consistently followed\nthroughout the fifty years of our history, was entirely appropriate\nto the then conditions obtaining in the scientific world and in the\nstrongly materialistic atmosphere of the nineteenth century. No\nnotion of the existence and interaction of a spiritual world with the\nfamiliar world of sense could then be entertained by the average man\nof science. And the few who were ready to uphold such a hypothesis,\nand perceive evidence of spiritual interaction in all manner of pheno-\nmena, were looked at askance, and were accused of returning to the\nprimitive superstitions of savages without anything like an adequate\nfoundation for their beliefs. The Founders, however, were aware that\nmany phenomena which superficially bore a spiritistic significance\nrnight be accounted for by unexplored and exceptional human facul-\nties ;\nand they did not wish to contemplate any further hypothesis\nuntil the possibilities of this mode of explaining them had been\nexhausted. Their object was to treat all phenomena submitted to\nthem in a purely scientific spirit. They aimed at founding a scientific\nsociety, which would gradually take its place among other scientific\nsocieties, each of which had chosen for its province a certain depart-\nment of knowledge, and to explore it by the same methods as had\nalready proved so fruitful in other departments. This aim has been\nsteadily kept in mind by the officers of the Society, and we have\nbeen fortunate in our Secretary, Miss Isabel Newton, who has carried\non the old tradition with exemplary patience and suavity, and, more-\nover, has exerted herself most competently to make the meetings\nheld in connection with the present jubilee celebrations a success.\nThis mode of regarding our work, and this cautious and critical\npolicy, was advocated by Henry Sidgwick in his early Presidential\nAddresses to the Society. But the same view was held and sustained\nby Myers at a later date, eighteen years later, right up to the end of\nthe nineteenth century, and is recorded in his great work, which\nappeared five years after his death, his majestic treatise on Human\nPersonality. This is so large and comprehensive a book that many\npeople are probably deterred from entering on a study of it, and I\ndoubt if it is familiar even to our own members. Saturated with the\nknowledge of abundant testimony from all parts of the world, and\nprepared by his co-operation with Edmund Gurney in the pre-\nparation of their joint book called Phantasms of the Living, he had\nplanned out a scheme for applying his idea of human personality,\nits faculties and its possibilities, to all the salient facts of observation,\nand accordingly sets them out under their respective heads. He\n\f127] The Past and the Future 63\ndeals first with the cases of multiple personality, or what he calls\ndisintegrations of personality, studied by the medical profession\nunder the meaningless term \" hysteria \" ; then he goes on to a\nremarkable treatment of genius ; then to sleep, and the amount of\nlucidity to be detected in its dream phenomena ; then to the\nartificial production of a condition akin to sleep known as hypnotism.\nThence he is led on to what he calls Automatisms, both sensory and\nmotor, which cover a great many of our more familiar non-medical\nphenomena. Then he extends the idea of phantasms of the living to\nphantasms of the dead, and so reaches the phenomena most specially\nstudied by this Society, in a chapter called \" Trance, Possession,\nand Ecstasy,\" where he allows himself to diverge from a rigid\nscrutiny of the facts, and foreshadows a transcendental view of the\nuniverse, with surprising eloquence, which he extends into a magni-\nficent Epilogue, with which the book closes ;\nexcept that there are a\ngreat number of appendices, one of which contains his comprehen-\nsive scheme of human faculty classified from one end to the other.\nThat is the general plan of the book, but it is too bulky and in many\nplaces too eloquent for ordinary readers. The whole scheme is\nforeshadowed and led up to in Chapter I, which he calls an Introduc-\ntion. And if this Introduction were mastered by our members, they\nwould have a much better idea of the aim and objects of our Society\nand of the position and hopes of at least one of our Founders than\nwithout that study they can be expected to have. For it must be\nremembered that, although Myers was able and anxious to study all\nthe faculties and activities of the human personality for which there\nwas evidence, his main interest and motive power was concerned\nwith its survival of bodily death ; and to this day this must be\nconsidered the question that interests most of our members. I will\nmake a few extracts from this Introduction for the purpose of show-\ning how a student like Myers, eagerly anxious for proof of survival,\nproceeds on his task.\n' The question for man most momentous of all is . . . whether or\nno his personality involves any element which can survive bodily\ndeath.\"\nIn approaching that question he advocates\n\" the method which our race has found most effective in acquiring\nknowledge . . . the method of modern Science\u2014that process which\nconsists in an interrogation of Nature entirely dispassionate, patient,\nsystematic ; such careful experiment and cumulative record as can\noften eUcit from her sUghtest indications her deepest truths. That\nmethod is now dominant throughout the civilised world ; and\nalthough in many directions experiments may be difficult and\ndubious, facts rare and elusive, Science works slowly on and bides\n\f64 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nher time,\u2014refusing to fall back upon tradition or to launch into\nspeculation, merely because strait is the gate which leads to valid\ndiscovery, indisuptable truth.\n\" I gay, then, that this method has never yet been applied to the\nall-important problem of the existence, the powers, the destiny of\nthe human soul.\"\nHe goes on to say that many learned minds hold the resolutely\nagnostic view \" ignoramus et ignorabimus The object of the\nS.P.R., he says, is to break down that artificial wall of demarcation\nwhich has thus far excluded from scientific treatment the problems\nwhich stand in most need of all the aids to discovery. Yet he admits\nthat\n\" Any science of which I can here speak as possible must be a\nnascent science\u2014not such as one of those vast systems of connected\nknowledge which thousands of experts now steadily push forward in\nlaboratories in every land\u2014but such as each one of those great\nsciences was in its dim and poor beginning, when a few monks groped\namong the properties of '\nthe noble metals,' or a few Chaldean\nshepherds outwatched the setting stars.\"\nHe next touches upon the religious objection to our researches,\n\u2014\nthat the doctrines of Christianity have rendered them unnecessary,\n\u2014\nand shows why in a purely scientific investigation that great Tradi-\ntion must not be appealed to. He admits that\n\" an event occurred which in the brief record of man's still\nincipient civilisation may be regarded as unique. A life was lived\nin which the loftiest response which man's need of moral guidance\nhad ever received was corroborated by phenomena which have been\nwidely regarded as convincingly miraculous, and which are said to\nhave culminated in a Resurrection from the dead. To those pheno-\nmena or to that Resurrection it would at this point be illegitimate\nfor me to refer in defence of my argument. I have appealed to\nScience, and to Science I must go ; \u2014in the sense that it would be\nunfair for me to claim support from that which Science in her strict-\nness can set aside as the tradition of a pre-scientific age. Yet this\none great tradition, as we know, has, as a fact, won the adhesion and\nreverence of the great majority of European minds. . . . [So it was]\nthat the Christian religion, the Christian Church, became for Europe\nthe accredited representative and guardian of all phenomena bearing\nupon the World Unseen.\"\nThe priests therefore were satisfied and sought no independent\nevidence of a spiritual world. Yet such evidence from time to time\nthere was. Gurney made a study of much of its literature, and\nSwedenborg had direct apprehension of a spiritual world as\n\" before all things a realm of law ; a region not of mere emotional\n\f127] The Past and the Future 65\nvagueness or stagnancy of adoration, but of definite progress accord-\ning to definite relations of cause and effect. For my own part I\nregard Swedenborg,\u2014not, assuredly, as an inspired teacher, nor\neven as a trustworthy interpreter of bis own experiences,\u2014but yet\nas a true and early precursor of that great inquiry which it is our\npresent object to advance.\"\nThen he goes on to say that Crookes was the first to apply the\nmethods of modern science to the spiritual world, and remarks how\noften his (Myers's) own conclusions concur with conclusions to\nwhich the scheme known as Modern Spiritualism had previously\narrived. And yet, he says, coming down to present-day contro-\nversies,\n\" this work of mine is in large measure a critical attack upon the\nmain Spiritist position, as held, say, by Mr A. R. Wallace, its most\neminent living supporter,\u2014the belief, namely, that all or almost all\nsupernormal phenomena are due to the action of spirits of the dead.\nBy far the larger proportion, as I hold, are due to the action of the\nstall embodied spirit of the agent or percipient himself. Apart from\nspeculative differences, moreover, I altogether dissent from the con-\nversion into a sectarian creed of what I hold should be a branch of\nscientific inquiry, growing naturally out of our existing knowledge.\nIt is, I believe, largely to this temper of uncritical acceptance,\ndegenerating often into blind credulity, that we must refer the lack\nof progress in Spiritualistic literature, and the encouragement which\nhas often been bestowed upon manifest fraud,\u2014so often, indeed, as\nto create among scientific men a strong indisposition to the study of\nphenomena recorded or advocated in a tone so alien from Science.\"\nHere we come to the crux of the matter which concerns us now, the\ndifferences between those in favour of Spiritualism as a religious\ncreed and those who regard psychical research as a branch of scien-\ntific enquiry. The first group is that of the Spiritualists proper,\npeople who glory in the title, and apply the methods in their religious\nworship. The attitude of Myers in this connection is instructive to\nus to-day. He goes on to speak of the feelings and intentions of the\nFounders of the Society in an instructive paragraph about the\nattitude of the early founders in\n\" 1873~at the crest, as one may say, of perhaps the highest wave\nof materialism which has ever swept over these shores\u2014[saying that]\nit became the conviction of a small group of Cambridge friends that\nthe deep questions thus at issue must be fought out in a way more\nthorough than the champions either of religion or of materialism had\nyet suggested. . . . What seemed needful was an inquiry of quite other\nscope than the mere analysis of historical documents, or of the\norigines of any alleged revelation in the past It must be an inquiry\n\f66 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nbased on the uniformitarian hypothesis ; on the presumption, that is\nto say, that if a spiritual world exists, and if that ivorld has at any epoch\nbeen manifest or even discoverable, then it ought to be manifest or dis-\ncoverable now.\"\nHe then begins his analysis of the Self, too long to quote further,\nfirst contrasting the views of Reid the philosopher, and Ribot the\nphysiologist, as to the identity of a self or the nature of personality,\nand begins his great doctrine of the Subliminal Self, and what part\nthis underground or subconscious portion of ourselves has to play\nin the phenomena that are being studied.\n\" The '\nconscious Self '\nof each of us, as we call it,\u2014the empirical,\nthe supraliminal Self, as I should prefer to say,~does not comprise\nthe whole of the consciousness or of the faculty within us. There\nexists a more comprehensive consciousness, a profounder faculty,\nwhich for the most part remains potential only so far as regards the\nlife of earth, but from which the consciousness and the faculty of\nearth-life are mere selections, and which reasserts itself in its pleni-\ntude after the liberating change of death.\"\nHe guards against the idea that he is speaking of any function of\nthe bram, distinguishing clearly between the mind and the brain.\nHe also guards against the American parody of his view, elaborated\nby Thomson J. Hudson in a well-written and much read work, that\nthere are two correlative and parallel selves co-existing always within\neach of us. In Myers's view our organism is not so framed as to\nafford the whole self full manifestation. And he proceeds to show\nhow this subliminal self hypothesis may account for many of the\nphenomena which had been thought to justify the immediate action\nof an external spiritual world.\n\" We can afiect each other at a distance, telepathically and if\nour incarnate spirits can act thus in at least apparent independence\nof the fleshly body, the presumption is strong that other spirits may\nexist independently of the body, and may affect us in similar man-\nner.\"\nHe thus leads direct into the controversy most active at the present\ntime, and seeks to hold a balance between the views of the extreme\nspiritualists, on the one hand, and of the enquirers into psychical\nfaculty, on the other.\nBefore concluding the chapter Myers considers what changes have\noccurred smce the research began, and what our present policy ought\n\" Ten years ago there was most evidence for telepathy between the\nliving ;\nfiext most for phantasms of the dead ;\nleast, perhaps, for\nthat actual possession and control of human organisms by departed\n\f127] The Past and the Future 67\nspirits, which of all our phenomena is likely to be the hardest for\nthe scientific mind to accept,\u2014since it carries us back to the most\noutrageously savage group among the superstitions of the early\nworld. With the recent development of trance-phenomena, however,\nthis semblance of logical proportion has been quickly altered.\"\n\" It seems to me now that the evidence for communication with\nthe spirits of identified deceased persons through the trance-utter-\nances and writings of sensitives apparently controlled by those spirits\nis established beyond serious attack.\"\n\" The point from which we started was an analysis of the latent\nfaculties of man. The point towards which our argument has carried\nus is the existence of a spiritual environment in which those faculties\noperate, and of unseen neighbours who speak to us thence with\nslowly gathering power. Deep in this spiritual environment the\ncosmic secret lies.\"\nFinally he asks whether we can learn anything in this way on the\nrelation of spiritual phenomena to Space, to Time, to the material\nworld. As an illustration, he takes the physical law that action at a\ndistance is impossible.\n\"A body can only act where it is. . . . But once get beyond pon-\nderable matter,\u2014once bring life and ether into play, and definitions\nbecome difficult indeed. The orator, the poet, we say, can only act\nwhere he is ; \u2014but where is he ? He has transformed the sheet of\npaper into a spiritual agency. . . . Telepathy indefinitely extends\nthe range of an unembodied spirit's potential presence.\"\nHe then speaks of the influence of our new knowledge on the idea\nof Time, our memory of the past and our possible precognitions of\nthe future, a subject which is attracting special attention still.\nFinally he touches on the influence exerted by spirit on the gross\nmaterial world, in other words what we call psycho-physical\nphenomena.\n\" We know that the spirit of a living man controls his own\norganism, and we shall see reason to think that discarnate spirits may\nalso control, by some form of '\npossession,' the organisms of living\npersons,\u2014may affect directly, that is to say, some portions of matter\nwhich we call living, namely, the brain of the entranced sensitive.\nThere seems to me, then, no paradox in the supposition that some\neffect should be produced by spiritual agency\u2014possibly through the\nmediation of some kind of energy derived from living human beings\n\u2014upon inanimate matter as well.\"\nBut he admits that the testimony in favour of such phenomena is\nspoilt by the mass of worthless narratives with which they have been\nin some sense smothered ; the long history of so-called investiga-\ntions which have consisted merely in an interchange of creduHty and\nE3\n\f68 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nfraud ;\nthough there are a few well-attested phenomena which seem\nprima facie to demand the physical intervention of discarnate\nintelligences.\nAll this that I have quoted and much more is contained in Myers's\nIntroduction and in the Introduction only. I have called attention\nto this chapter because it is well worthy of being reproduced in\naccessible form. It is a kind of overture to the performance of the\nrest of the book, an overture to all our researches since. The evidence\nfor physical phenomena has increased since his day ; but how much\nof it is trustworthy it is hard to say. I myself am convinced of\ntelekinesis, by direct observation. It is the thin end of the wedge,\nand may be the introduction to a multitude of semi-physiological\nphenomena, which at present\u2014though in many respects repellent\n\u2014\nscientific men feel more inclined to investigate than they do the\nbetter established psychical phenomena which Myers mostly dealt\nwith. But in admitting telekinesis, I have no adequate explanation\nof it, only hypothesis, which has to run the gauntlet of criticism.\nThe scientific world in general does not yet admit the fact. It is\nvery liable to wait for some rational explanation before doing so.\nWe have learnt not to trust the evidence of our senses in directions\nwhich seem either inexplicable or impossible or absurd. There are\nexperiments which are not worth performing, such as experiments\nwith goats on the top of the Brocken : and many scientific men con-\nsider that attempts at telekinesis are in that category. Faraday said\nthat we must make up our minds as to what is possible and what\nimpossible. I don't agree, and yet I find myself doing it in some\ncases. Sir George Stokes would not attend to Crookes's demon-\nstration of an unsuspected force. There are traces of that irrational\nkind of scepticism in all of us.\nWhen I was recently in Bavaria, I was told in good faith, though\nwith some superlatives, about the powers of certain simply-living\npeasants and monks and the way in which they could do miraculous\nthings. Their dowsing faculty seemed extraordinarily developed ;\nand they had a theory that rays emanated from water and other\nobjects and operated on the rod. They went further, and said that\nwhere two underground streams crossed, the rays were unhealthy to\nhuman organisms, but that by burying certain substances in the\nground, these rays could be either deflected or rendered harmless ;\nso that a place which had been deleterious became exceptionally\nhealthy. All this was more than I could swallow, although I was\ntold with an abundance of personal testimony. And yet it needs\ninvestigation, if the result is only to find out what has caused these\nstrange and incredible beliefs. It requires an efiiort to keep one's\nmind open ; but there is no doubt that the only right attitude for a\nperson with an open mind is the one which has been advocated\n\f127] The Past and the Future 69\nthroughout by the Founders of our Society ; and I will again make\nan extract from Myers, in Vol. II, page 304:, to emphasise it.\n\" To most of my hearers I doubt not that this forecast of a coming\nco-operation between incarnate and discarnate spirits will have\nseemed speculative and premature. . . . But one point is clear. . . .\nWe must maintain, in old theological language, that tlie intellectual\nvirtues have now becoDie necessary to salvation. Curiosity, candour,\ncare ; \u2014these are the intellectual virtues ; \u2014disinterested curiosity,\nunselfish candour, unremitting care. These virtues have grown up\noutside the ecclesiastical pale ;\nScience, not Religion, has fostered\nthem ; \u2014nay. Religion has held them scarcely consistent with that\npious spirit which hopes to learn by humility and obedience the\nsecrets of an unseen world. Here surely our new ideals suggest not\nopposition but fusion. To us as truly as to monk or anchorite the\nspiritual world is an intimate, an interpenetrating reality. But its\nvery reality suggests the need of analysis, the risk of misinterpreta-\ntion ; the very fact that we have outgrown our sacerdotal swaddling-\nclothes bids us learn to walk warily among pitfalls which call for all\nthe precautions that systematic reason can devise.\"\nMyers goes on to specify the pitfalls more particularly.\n\" Upon a new scheme of beliefs, attractive to the popular mind as\nthe scheme which I prefigure, a swarm of follies and credulities must\ninevitably perch and settle. Yet let those who mock at the weak-\nnesses of '\nmodern Spiritualism '\nask themselves to what extent\neither orthodox religion or official science has been at pains to guard\nthe popular mind against losing balance upon contact with new facts,\nprofoundly but obscurely significant. Have the people's religious\ninstructors trained them to investigate for themselves ? Have their\nscientific instructors condescended to investigate for them ? Who\nshould teach them to apply to their '\ninspirational speakers '\nany\ntest more searching than they have been accustomed to apply to the\nsermons of priest or bishop ? What scientific man has told them\nenough of the hidden powers within them to prevent them from\nascribing to spiritual agency whatever mental action their ordinary\nconsciousness may fail to recognise as its own ?\n\" The rank and file of Spiritists have simply transferred to certain\nnew dogmas\u2014for most of which they at least have some compre-\nhensible evidence\u2014the uncritical faith which they were actually\ncommended for bestowing on certain old dogmas, \u2014for many of\nwhich the evidence was at least beyond their comprehension. In\nsuch a case ridicule is no remedy. The remedy lies, as I have said, in\ninculcating the intellectual virtues ; \u2014in teaching the mass of man-\nkind that the maxims of the modern savant are at least as necessary\nto salvation as the maxims of the mediaeval saint.\n\f70 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\n\" Now here, I take it, lies the special, the characteristic duty of the\nSociety for Psychical Research. . . . Our own more special duty is to\nofier, through an age of transition more momentous than mankind\nhas ever known, that help in steadying and stimulating psychical\nresearch all over the world which our collective experience should\nenable us richly to bestow. Such function ought, I say, to be ours\nindeed. We alone have taken the first steps to deserve it. I see our\noriginal programme completely justified. I see our raison d'etre\nindisputably established. I see all things coming to pass as we fore-\nsaw. What I do not see, alas ! is an energy and capacity of our own,\nsufficient for our widening duty ; \u2014enough of labourers for the vine-\nyard so ripe for harvest. Aye. the competent labourers are still too\nfew and too old. Let us welcome those younger people who have\nseriously entered on the task of exploration. The energy is with\nthem, the wisdom is doubtless growing. To them we must be con-\ntent to hand on the torch and encourage them in their strenuous\nand thankless task. Myers appeals broadly for sympathy and\nunderstanding co-operation with equal confidence to savant and to\nsaint.\n\" To the savant we point out that we are not trying to pick holes\nin the order of Nature, but rather, by the scrutiny of residual pheno-\nmena, to get nearer to the origin and operation of Nature's central\nmystery of Life. . . .\n\" To the Christian we can speak with a still more direct appeal.\n'\nYou believe,' I would say, '\nthat a spiritual world exists, and that it\nacted on the material world two thousand years ago. Surely it is so\nacting still.'\n\"\nAnd then he goes on with an eloquent and oft-quoted meditation\nconcerning the constantly asserted insignificance or triviality of our\nphenomena.\n\" Out of the long Stone Age our race is awakening into conscious-\nness of itself. We stand in the dawn of history. Behind us lies a\nvast and unrecorded waste\u2014the mighty struggle humanam condere\ngentein. Since the times of that ignorance we have not yet gone\nfar ; a few thousand years, a few hundred thinkers, have barely\nstarted the human mind upon the great aeons of its onward way. . . .\nThe traditions, the intuitions of our race are themselves in their\ninfancy ; and before we abandon ourselves to brooding over them\nlet us at least first try the upshot of a systematic search for actual\nfacts. For what should hinder ? If our inquiry lead us first through\na jungle of fraud and folly, need that alarm us ? As well might\nColumbus have yielded to the sailors' panic, when he was entangled\nin the Sargasso Sea. If our first clear facts about the Unseen World\nseem small and trivial, should that deter us from the quest ? As\nwell might Columbus have sailed home again, with America in the\n\f127] The Past ayul the Future 71\nofl&ng, on the ground that it was not worth while to discover a con-\ntinent which manifested itself only by dead logs.\"\nI will quote no more. Let that suffice to show what the aim of our\nFounders was, and what our continued duty is.\nBut now I must ask whether any change has occurred in our sur-\nroundings during the thirty years that have elapsed since Myers\nwrote, and whether any modification in the behaviour of our\norganism can be wisely made, so as to adapt itself better to its new\nenvironment. At the time of founding the Society, the scientific\nworld was actively hostile. I do not think it is equally hostile now.\nA few individuals recently were actively hostile, but most of them\nhave now proceeded to a stage where presumably trustworthy in-\nformation is more accessible, and where they probably find that they\nwere mistaken. Among the younger men, now, some respectful\ninterest is shown in our researches, though most of them are deterred\nfrom entering on the enquiry from a feeling that their time and\nenergies are fully occupied in more immediately remunerative pur-\nsuits. The scientific world is very active now in all its branches, and\nmany feel that their energies are better expended for the moment in\nfollowing up lines of orthodox enquiry. But orthodoxy constantly\nchanges its outlook, and the folly of one generation is liable to become\nthe commonplace of another. It is our business to hold on steadily\nin our course until in due time some approach to this stage is reached.\nWe cannot make ourselves responsible for the statement that such\nand such a phenomenon really did occur : the most that we can say\nis that such and such a scientific man was convinced of its occur-\nrence. The weight to be attached to such conviction will depend\nupon our other knowledge of the man himself and his position in the\nscientific world : it is not possible for anyone to attain a high posi-\ntion in that world without long continued experience in the percep-\ntion of relevant facts. A report is never absolutely complete : no\nscientific statement is ever infallible ; the body of accepted scientific\ndoctrine is always fluid and changing and alive, never rigid infallible\nand dead.\nWe want to be courteous, not to scientific men only, but to all\nco-workers, whether we are able to agree with them or not, so long\nas they are honest. Take such a man as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,\nfor instance ; he must have sacrificed something to enter upon an\nunpopular enquiry. He was doing his best according to his lights,\nand though he may seem to us deficient in judgment, he was abound-\ning in energy, and put some of us to shame. We need not accept the\nresults of such men or believe their doctrines, but I think we should\nbe careful not to alienate them, and turn them from criticising friends\ninto implacable enemies. I do not know that we are to blame for the\nhostility of Conan Doyle towards the end of his active and vigorous\n\f72 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nlife ; but he was a simple-hearted bluff man, who, having begun by a\ntraining in medicine and as an agnostic, ultimately became an almost\nundiscriminating enthusiast for what he believed to be spiritual\ntruth, or what he conceived to be the truth, and devoted himself to\nspreading a knowledge of it throughout the English-speaking world.\nHis methods of propagation may have been injudicious, they cer-\ntainly were not ours ; and he was much more convinced of a spiritual\nexplanation of all our phenomena than we are. Individuals and\norganisations may rightly emphasise different sides or aspects of the\nsubject, but they can work in harmony nevertheless. I am glad that\nwe of the S.P.R. work in harmony with the L.S.A. at the present\ntime, and am glad to reckon both Mrs de Crespigny and Mr David\nGow among our members.\nThere is a suggestion that I want to make, or rather put forward as\na subject for discussion concerning procedure in our changed environ-\nment. We have hitherto in our corporate capacity entertained no\ncorporate conviction, and reported no progress, unless indeed we\nhave committed ourselves to a corporate belief in telepathy. Many\nof us are now similarly convinced of the reality of a spiritual world\nand of its interaction with this world. I wonder whether it would be\npremature to say so, and thus show that we are working not merely\ntowards some unknown and perhaps unprofitable end, but are really\nin our own opinion making progress.\nOur enterprise began with an enquiry into obscure human facul-\nties, but has gradually drifted, partly under Myers's guidance, into\nan enquiry into evidences for survival. At first these evidences in\nour published reports turned mainly upon those extensions of human\nfaculty with which Myers dealt in his book. But now we want to ask\nwhether our experience of trance-utterances and communications\nreceived from departed members on the other side have not enlarged\nour views and given us direct evidence that they are living and\nactive. For my part I believe that that is true, and the time will\ncome when we must admit the fact and say so ; thus doing justice\nto their efforts at giving unmistakable proof of their continued\nactivity. I suggest that that time has now arrived, and that during\nthe next fifty years we might announce this as a verified hypothesis,\nand use it as an explanation of occurrences in which it is evidently an\noperative factor. For the way to verify a hypothesis which has some\nmodicum of uncertainty about it is to use the hypothesis in practice,\nand test it by applying it in all suitable directions, so as to see if it\nwill stand the strain of confrontation with fact. In this particular\nfield I know no other hypothesis that will stand the strain and cover\nthe ground equally well.\nBut I know that there still are difficulties. Some of them have\nbeen recently emphasised by Mr Soal. For instance, he has had\n\f127] The Past and the Future 73\ncommunications from apparently a completely fictitious character :\nand again he has had messages from a man who turned out to be\nliving in the flesh, and who knew nothing about the sending of those\nmessages. Yet the strange thing is that the facts narrated in the\nmessages were veridical\u2014that is, they were either true at the time,\nor were going to be true in the near future.\nFor this anticipation of the future in some detail we find rather a\nconsiderable body of testimony. Experience of the past, as if we\nwere present, is strange enough : as narrated in An Adventure and\nsimilar works. But appearances or statements in the present which\nare only going to be fulfilled in the future are still more incredible.\nThe nature of time and space are, it so happens, under discussion\namong modern physicists to-day. Some of them hold that they are\nsubjective abstractions, having no objective reality. The question\nof causality is mixed up with this discussion ; and the doctrines of\nfixed fate, predestination, determinism, and free will, are all now\nsubject to debate, not only on the philosophic side, but even on\nphysical grounds. It seems to me that our researches are more\nlikely to give information on these topics than are more orthodox\nfacts. The question of our relations to space was raised by Myers, you\nremember, in connection with telepathy and travelling clairvoyance.\nOur relation to time is a still more difl&cult problem. Mr Dunne has\nattempted an experimental attack upon it by means of dream\nexperience, and probably there is much more that can be done in\nthat direction. I am glad to say that our admirable librarian Mr\nBesterman is giving us the benefit of his great knowledge and is co-\noperating with Mr Dunne in this research. Prediction by inference\nfrom the present is familiar enough. The other ordinary kind of\nprediction is prediction by planning. Every instance of precognition,\nshould be criticised to see if there is more than can be explained by\neither of these causes. I think there are some, and any that exist\nmust be profoundly instructive to those who study the subject.\nMr Dunne is by no means the only one who has attended to the\nquestion of precognition. A church door and some other details\nwere mentioned as belonging to a house in which it was said I was\ngoing to live, and in which I am now living. The prediction was\nmade at a time when I knew nothing of the existence of the house,\nand when, as afterwards transpired, no door was there. A church\ndoor was independently, and so to speak accidentally, added by the\nlandlord, who was not the landlord at the time of the prediction,\nand who knew nothing about it. Nor did I know anything about\nthe house or enter into its occupancy until a period of some seven\nyears had elapsed. Incidents of this kind, of which there are several\nin our records, can hardly be explained as prediction based on\ninference. They may possibly be contemplated in terms of planning,\n\f74 Sir Oliver Lodge [part 127]\nbut it would need to be a supernormal planning on the part of in-\ntelligences in a spiritual world. Either that, or our notion of time\nmust be overhauled, and the connection between past, present, and\nfuture, radically reconsidered.\nOur spirits seem to transcend space relations, as evidenced by\ntravelling clairvoyance. The question arises, Do they ever transcend\ntime relations too ? We have not yet solved the mystery of the Gor-\ndon Davis case.\nOur enquiry has led us in many directions which at present are\npuzzling, because we have not yet the clue. Yet who would wish it\notherwise ? The history of science is full of such quandaries, and\nin many of them we have found that persistent exploration, though\nit never removes all mystery, yet shifts it in a direction to which we\nhave grown more accustomed : and we thus get some kind of satis-\nfaction if we persevere.\nIn conclusion, I will take this opportunity of once more affirming,\nwhat I have often assured bereaved persons of, that the human spirit\nis not limited to its incarnation in the matter of this planet, but that\nit has a cosmic and permanent existence quite apart from its dis-\ncarded material organism which it constructed and used for a time\nas its instrument of manifestation. Although it can no longer mani-\nfest itself easily to our earth-bound animal senses, and has therefore\ngone beyond our normal ken, yet as an individual spiritual entity\nit continues amid other surroundings, with its memory, character,\nand affection intact ; a departed person still has a power to help\nstruggling humanity, and can occasionally communicate with those\nleft behind, either by their own receptive powers or by the vicarious\naid of some privileged person who is willing and able to act as a\nreceiver. We have still much to learn about the condition of what\nwe call the future life, on which we shall all enter at the appointed\ntime ; but we have testimony that people are freer and happier\nwhen they have thus got rid of their bodily troubles ; that their\ndeparture is not an event to be unduly mourned ; and that both we\nand they may await reunion with a placid and equable mind :\nmeanwhile not ceasing from eiiort, but doing our duty and attending\nto mundane requirements for the remainder of our earth life.\n\fPSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHICAL RESEARCH i\nBy William Beown, M.A., M.D. (Oxon.), D.Sc. (Lond.), F.R.C.P.\nIn beginning my lecture on the relationship of psychology to\npsychical research I hope yon will allow me to be slightly autobio-\ngraphical. My interest was aroused in the subject of psychology in\ndirect relationship to psychical research by F. W. H. Myers's Human\nPersonality and its Survival of Bodily Death. That took me from\nscience to philosophy. It caused me as an undergraduate at Oxford\nto give up my scientific work temporarily in order to do Classical\n\" Greats,\" and in the process to take up psychology as a special\nsubject in order to learn more about it and understand better what\nF. W. H. Myers was writing about.\nI should like the central topic of this lecture to be F. W. H.\nMyers's theory of the subliminal self\u2014which formed the background\nof his own investigations in psychical research and continues to be\nthe background of the work of great researchers like Sir Oliver\nLodge and other experts in the science\u2014and to compare and con-\ntrast it with the modern doctrine of the psychology of the uncon-\nscious mind. These two theories are not identical, as Sir Oliver\nLodge pointed out in an aside in his Presidential Address to this\nSociety. It is true that when Myers began developing his theory he\nhad before him the work of such medical psychologists as Pierre\nJanet and the early work of Breuer and Freud. But his own theory\nof the subliminal mind aimed at giving an adequate explanation of\nevery type of abnormal phenomenon in regard to mental activity. It\nsufficed to collate the facts of pathological psychology, especially\nthe most outstanding manifestations of hysteria and the causation of\nhysterical symptoms ; and it also sufficed to give a preliminary or\nsuggestive account or explanation of supernormal phenomena,\nincluding the phenomena of genius and of intellectual and artistic\ninspiration. The modern theory of the unconscious mind, of course,\nhas different forms and has undergone a continuous process of\ndevelopment at the hands of medical psychologists, but it is con-\ncerned almost entirely with an explanation of subnormal pathological\ndisturbances of consciousness.\nCorresponding with this dift'erence in aim, there is a difference of\nimplication. Whereas modern exponents of the doctrine of the un-\nconscious look confidently to the time when they will be able to\n^ Read at a General Meeting of the Society, 4 July 1932.\n\f76 William Brown [part\ncorrelate these unconscious mental mechanisms with physical\nprocesses in some part or other of the brain, Myers certainly did not\nenvisage that possibility. Indeed, the driving idea in his theorising\nwas to explain manifestations that were apparently beyond the\npossibilities of organised matter to produce. He felt, as so many\nothers feel at the present day, that all forms of genius transcend\nmere physical activity, that the mind is ahead of the body, is in\nadvance of the brain, and all that the brain has to do in any activity\nof genius is to preserve the after-efiects of that activity, to lay down,\nas it were, the traces of the activity of genius fari passu with such\nactivity. Thus Myers's theory is distinctly a spiritualistic and ideal-\nistic theory, which takes the mind as more real than the body, and\nthe theory in modern psychology that corresponds to that is such a\ntheory as I myself hold, of the mind being wider than the brain. It\nmay be said that the brain is related to the mind as the shadow of an\nobject is related to the object itself. Just as an object in three\ndimensions can throw a shadow in two dimensions, and every point\nseen in the shadow will correspond to some point or other in the\nsolid object, and any movement in the solid object is mirrored by\nchanges in the shadow, and yet nevertheless the solid object is\ngreater than the shadow, so, it seems to me, is the mind as compared\nwith the brain. The mind is a form of activity that involves at\nleast one more dimension than does the brain. That extra dimension\nis free activity, though, of course, limited in its scope, and this addi-\ntional dimension may eventually be correlated with further change\nin our conception of the physical nature of the brain.\nThat is where the modern doctrine of space-time comes in. It is\nsometimes considered and has often been suggested of recent years\nthat the advances made by the theory of relativity and the quantum\ngive us greater scope in explaining conscious activity, conscious\nfreedom, and the prediction of the future ; but I venture to suggest\nthat such a generalisation is rather premature. I had the oppor-\ntunity of asking the author of the theory of relativity what was his\nview as to the relationship between space-time and psychological\ntime, and I was not at all surprised when he replied that from\nhis point of view as a physicist there was no relationship. In\npsychological time there is not only sequence of experiences but an\nawareness of sequence, and such a relationship as that is not ex-\nplained by the modern theory of space-time.\nNevertheless, I would venture to suggest that there is a relation-\nship between the two which will become apparent in years to come.\nThe consciousness is related to an extremely complex physical\nstructure, namely, the brain, and experience of time\u2014present, past,\nand future\u2014seems to be boimd up with extremely complicated\nphysical processes. Whereas before the formulation of and the\n\f127] Psychology and Psychical Research 77\ntheory of relativity the problem was to correlate the temporal\nchanges in space of physical bodies or particles with the experience\nof sequence, the problem now is to correlate that experience of\nsequence with the system of space-time events in the brain. In\nany case, as far as physics and physiology go, the possibilities open\nout before us of a further explanation of the mind in its relationship\nto physical change\u2014an explanation which will have to wait for still\ngreater discoveries, not only in physics, but in cerebral physiology,\nbefore they can be regarded as solid additions to scientific knowledge.^\nDuring the last fifty years\u2014the period of existence of the Society\nfor Psychical Research\u2014great advance has been made in the psycho-\nlogical study of the abnormal mind. We understand more clearly\nthe nature of the dissociation that occurs in hysteria and the relation-\nship between mental symptoms and the underlying causes of those\nsymptoms. We find that in the mind things are not always what\nthey seem, and that often an unintelligible mental symptom, such\nas an obsession or a feeling of compulsion, is related to very early and\ndeep-seated events and experiences of childhood which have under-\ngone repression and distortion in various ways. It is along those\nlines that the conception of the unconscious mind has grown up to\nexplain the phenomena of hysteria and the phenomena of other\nforms of psychoneurosis. It was inevitable that the relationship\nshould be noticed between hysteria as a functional disturbance of\nthe mind accompanied by dissociation and characterised by ready\nhypnotisability, with the manifestations often found in medium-\nship. The medium has been regarded by many psychologists as a\ncase of hysteria with mental dissociation, the control of the medium,\noften boasted of or possessed, being regarded as a split-ofi personaUty\nof the individual, and in many cases as a regression or stepping-back\ntowards a more infantile reaction towards life. It is quite true that\nthat parallel did seem to hold on superficial glance. We have on the\none hand Morton Prince's most striking case of multiple personality,\nthat of Miss Beauchamp, where the Sally Beauchamp, the co-con-\nsciousness, was in all probability a regression to a more infantile\ntype of reaction towards life. Sally corresponded to a care-free child\nof 13 or 14, and when Sally disappeared eventually through the use of\nhypnosis, she was got rid of by Morton Prince keeping her below the\nthreshold of consciousness and tying her up in that way, sending her\nback whence she came, namely, to the infantile stratum of the un-\nconscious.\nThen we have a distinguished medium like Mrs Osborne Leonard,\n1 In this connection reference should be made to the extremely interesting\nphenomena of seeing the past and the future, respectively, described in\nAdventure, Miss Moberly and Miss Jourdain, and in An Experiment with Time,\nJ. W. Dunne.\n\f78 William Brown [part\npossessing a control, \" Feda,\" who is apparently of a childisli nature\nand may psychologically be regarded as a regression in relation to\nMrs Leonard's adult consciousness. If I speak there as though I\nagreed with this theory, I hasten to add that it is only a very super-\nficial way of describing and envisaging the facts, and what we have\nto consider is the possibility that this relationship is not anything\nlike so close as those who have not made much direct study of\nmediums are ready to believe.\nIn France during the war I was fortunate enough to be neurologist\nto the Fourth Army on the Somme, and there I saw between 4,000\nand 5,000 cases of severe nervous illness. Of these cases, 15 per cent\nwere of pronounced hysteria, with loss of memory and other forms\nof functional dissociation. These men were easily hypnotisable, so\nthat I was able to hypnotise more than 600 cases in France, putting\nthem into a definite second sleep-like state, where they were quite\ndifferent from the normal, and would wake up with complete loss of\nmemory of what had been happening during their sleep, unless one\nhad suggested that they should remember. Quite a number of these\n600 cases showed mediumistic or clairvoyant characters.'- I tested\nthis in a number of patients who on being hypnotised appeared\nto become clairvoyant. They would pass into a dream-like state,\ndreaming of events at the ordinary rate, not at the rate at which\ndreams generally occur, but at the rate of waking life. I recall one\nsuch case in particular. A man dreamed he was back in his native\ncity of Liverpool, where he saw his father and mother walking along\none of the principal streets in the evening on their way to the cinema-\nhouse. He followed them and stood in the queue while they got their\ntickets, following them also into the auditorium, and noticing the\ntitle of the film on the screen. In this particular case verification\nwas not possible, because the man went down the line and replies to\nmy queries never reached me. In many other cases one got similar\nresults, and in certain of these cases I was able to get independent\nevidence from the relatives at home as to what was happening at\nthat time at home. In some of the cases there was no correspon-\ndence whatever, in others there was some amount of corres-\npondence. But these people were very definitely in a state of hyp-\nnosis, definitely abnormal or pathological. They did not all show\nthis tendency towards apparent clairvoyance. Moreover, a certain\nnumber of them seemed to have powers of telepathy as far as one\ncould test them, while others had not. Thinking over those past\nexperiences, I now consider that they indicated, not by any means an\nidentity between the hypnotic state and the state of mediumship,\nbut simply that a certain small proportion of hypnotisable cases\nshowed clairvoyant and telepathic powers.\n^ Science and Personality, 1929, pp. 184-193.\n\f127] Psychology and Psychical Research 79\nSince then I have had the opportunity of seeing a number of\nmediums at work frequently, and I have been able to go further in\nmy deductions. I am inclined now to think that in the cases of\nsuccessful mediumship there is very little evidence of hysteria,\nthough I think there is some such evidence. The procedure of going\ninto a trance is similar to the procedure of self-hypnotisation, and\nthe appearance of the control is similar to a procedure whereby\nsome infantile tendency emerges from the subconscious mind.\nBut the later effects, such as the messages which come through,\nmust be considered, too, for their own sake and on their own merits,\nand the mere fact that there is this resemblance to hysteria, and\nthe further fact that so many hysterics have no powers of telepathy\nor clairvoyance at all, mean that we must either regard the medium\nas a special type of hysteric, or that the medium is a type distinct\naltogether, with the characteristic of self-hypnosis as an additional\none. The latter is the view I hold at the present day, influenced\nmainly by my experiences with Mrs Osborne Leonard. I have had a\nlarge number of sittings with that lady. The first four sittings were\ncarried out through the kindness of Sir Oliver Lodge and his secre-\ntary in such a way that Mrs Leonard did not know me at the time,\nand the sittings were reported by a stenographer who did not know\nme and whom I did not know. Those four first interviews afforded\nan enormous amount of information. Mrs Leonard had apparently,\nthrough Feda, got into touch with four people on the other side, the\nonly four people in whom I had felt any special interest. The whole\nthing, of course, can possibly be explained in terms of telepathy ;\nundoubtedly a good deal of telepathy was taking place, but here\nagain we are faced with another alternative, of the explanation in\nterms of telepathy and in terms of agency of discarnate spirits.\nIf I may now turn to experiments on telepathy and the work done\nby the Society for Psychical Kesearch, together with that of the\nBoston Society in America, and other bodies during the last thirty or\nforty years, I would point out that whereas in some of the earlier\nexperiments the evidence for telepathy seemed very abundant, so\nthat it was regarded as not only definitely proved but very wide-\nspread, more recent experiments with larger groups of cases un-\ndoubtedly show that telepathy is not a widespread phenomenon.\nI am thinking of the special work of Mr S. G. Soal,^ for the Society\nfor Psychical Research, in which he dealt with about 600 per-\ncipients and used to the full the possibilities of statistical analysis\nin drawing conclusions from his data. Those conclusions were\nentirely negative. The conclusion to be drawn from that is, not\nthat telepathy is non-existent, but that when one takes a large\n^ S. G. Soal, \" Experiments in Supernormal Perception at a Distance,\"\nProceedings S.P.R., xl. 165-362.\n\f80 William Brown [part\nmunberof cases at random, or almost atrandom, the negative results\n\u2014\nthat is, the failures\u2014swamp the successes to such an extent that the\nresults show nothing of the activity of telepathy. But we know from\nstatistical work in other domains of psychology\u2014I am thinking of\nthe special work with mental tests\u2014that the statistical method is\ndangerous. It is two-edged. Although helpful from the mathe-\nmatical point of view, it must be combined with extreme care on the\nmaterial side\u2014the side of the psychological material with which one\nis dealing. If one tests people at random and tries to work out\ncorrelation coefficients in different directions, carrying out the tests in\nsuch a way as to encourage the action of chance as much as possible,\nthe correlation coefficients will be extremely low ; on the other hand,\nif the material be selected in view of the problem being studied,\nthen the statistical results become much more precise. They begin\nto show a helpful mathematical precision, and one can draw con-\nclusions from one's data, as is now being done in Professor\nSpearman's school.\nIn the same way further advance will be made, using statistical\nmethods, in investigating telepathy by a more careful study of the\nindividual case and a more careful selection of data. I am sure that\nMr Soal himself would be the first to agree with that, so we must not\ncontrast his results too readily with the results of earlier investi-\ngators. The latter have been obtained rather along the lines of\nintensive study of individual cases and the gradual accumulation of\ncorroborative evidence. This evidence appears in many of the Society's-\npublications. All that cumulative evidence is unshakable, and\nfurnishes a sufficient scientific foundation for the theory of telepathy.\nFortunately, just at the moment when these more recent negative\nresults might discourage one, there comes from America some very\nimportant work done with Mr and Mrs Upton Sinclair and Mrs\nSinclair's brother-in-law, Mr R. L. Irwin, which is described in.\nMental Radio and analysed carefully by Dr Walter Prince in one\nof the latest monographs of the Proceedings of the Boston Society for\nPsychic Research.^ Here the evidence seems to be overwhelming as\nto the existence of telepathy in certain special cases. I will give one\nexample. The first correspondence that Mrs Upton Sinclair had.\nwith her brother-in-law, Mr Irwin, who was working thirty miles\naway, was as follows. It was agreed that he should draw an object\nand think of it for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and that Mrs.\nSinclair should be lying on a couch in semi-darkness, making her\nmind a blank, ready to receive the corresponding impression. The\nimpression which she received was that of a chair with horizontal\nsupports at the back, and, a moment later, of a chair with vertical\n1 The Sinclair Experiments Demonstrating Telepathy. By the Research.\nOfficer. Bulletin xvi, Boston Society for Psychic Research, 1932.\n\f127] Psychology and Psychical Research 81\nsupports, and then, feeling that the first chair was more probable\nthan the second, she thought that the chair with vertical strips at\nthe back was similar in appearance to the foot of Mr Irwin's bed. She\nalso gathered the impression that the drawing was on green paper.\nThe facts were that at that time Mr Irwin had drawn on green paper\nthe sketch of a chair with horizontal strips at the back, and had been\nlooking at the actual chair through the foot of his bed, which con-\ntained vertical strips.^ If you analyse a correspondence like that\nyou will find that there are a large number of different elements, and\nthat the probability is against all those different elements simul-\ntaneously coming together. The probability against that occurring\nby chance is simply enormous. Compound probability is estimated\nthrough multiplication, so that, for example, if there is a one-tenth\nprobability of either of two events occurring, the probability against\nboth events happening is 100 to 1. That again illustrates the great\ndifficulty in experiments with large numbers. The difficulty is tc get a\nunit of measurement so as to allow adequately for the correspondences.\nSimilar laboratory experiments have been done with playing\ncards, to test the phenomenon of clairvoyance (Miss Ina Jephson),\nand in very large numbers the results have been negative. The fail-\nures have more than wiped out the effect of the successes. But there\nagain the same argument holds good. Nevertheless it was important\nthat these investigations should have been carried out. If they had\nnot been carried out by the Society for Psychical Research they\nwould certainly have been carried out by those antagonistic to the\nSociety and held up as disproof of telepathy and clairvoyance. But\na closer study in the light of statistical theory shows that the results\nby no means rule out the occurrence of telepathy and clairvoyance,\nall that they do is to emphasise the rarity of such events under\nexperimental conditions.\nThese negative results are important, specially important to us,\nbecause in recent years the tendency has grown up to explain away\nall evidence for survival by citing telepathy and clairvoyance by the\nliving. When we have material brought forward claimed to be an\nevidence of survival, the reply of the critics is that it is only tele-\npathy or clairvoyance. They are only too ready to bring forward\nthat explanation, as if the factors of telepathy and clairvoyance were\nof very wide-reaching application. If we find, on the contrary, that\nthey are greatly restricted, that diminishes the probability that a\ncomplicated telepathic explanation can be accepted for the evidence\nof survival, and correspondingly increases the strength of the evi-\ndence on the other side.\nA few days ago I had an interesting example of telepathy, or at\nleast so it seems to me. I was talking to a man of high classical\n1 Op. cit., pp. 9, 10.\n\f82 William Brown [part\nattainments, and we were discussing the \" Prometheus Vinctus \" of\nAeschylus, especially that phrase in the first speech of Prometheus\nafter he has been bound to his rock, the phrase, badly translated in\nEnglish as \" many-twinkling smile of ocean,\" but more literally and\nmore elegantly \" the innumerable laughter of the waves of the sea.\"\nAs I thought of the English translation there came to my mind the\n(imaginary) Greek word TroXvyeXacriuLa\u2014a reminiscence of a school-\nboy howler I made many years ago. The actual Greek phrase is\nirovTiwv T\u20ac KU\/mriTwi'\navi']piQfxov yeXucrfxa (U. 89-90).\nBut the first expression came to my mind, I did not articulate it, I\njust thought it, and, a moment later, like an echo, there came from\nthis classical scholar the word TroXuyeXacriua. Immediately after-\nwards he said, \" I do not know why I said that. Of course it is wrong.\nThere is no such word.\" He is inclined to agree with me that it was an\nexample of telepathy. The alternative explanations would be either\ncoincidence, that we both thought of 7roXuyeXa<Tiu.a, which is improb-\nable ; or that he made a mistake, as I made it when a boy, but then you\nmust remember that he was a classic who would certainly not make\nthat blunder ; and there is the further alternative possibility that I\nwhispered it, and he heard the involuntary whisper, but I think that\ncan be ruled out.\nMy own experience of telepathy has generally been with cases in\nwhich I have been the agent, and not the percipient. The results\nI got with Mrs Leonard were probably due to the fact that I was the\nagent and Mrs Leonard the percipient. I get a number of examples\nwith nerve patients, who are receiving suggestion treatment,\nwhile they are lying j^assive on a couch screened ofE from the rest of\nthe room, their muscles relaxed, and their minds in an empty state.\nThey frequently tell me that in such a state, in semi-darkness,\npictures come to their minds, and such pictures sometimes correspond\nto events actually happening on the other side of the screen. One\nspecial case so impressed a patient of mine who was receiving this\ntreatment that he wrote it down ready to be sent in to the Society,\nbut I had not time to complete the account. I will give it to you now.\nThe day after the treatment, when he came to me again, he asked\nwhat I had been doing at the desk during the previous day's treat-\nment. He asked me whether I was reading a particular journal,\n\" Because,\" he said, \" I had a vivid picture of a scientific journal,\nwith two columns, in the form of a letter signed at the bottom.\" On\nreflection, I realised that I had been glancing at Nature, and my eye\nhad been caught by one of the letters there, because it was signed\nover the address \" King's College, London.\" I opened the copy of\nNature and showed it to him\u2014not that particular passage\u2014and he\nlooked through it, and found the identical letter. It was not that\n\f127] Psychology and Psychical Research 83\nhe had been able to read the letter while he lay on the couch the\nprevious day, but the general picture of that letter had appeared to\nhis mind. He was convinced that it was a case of telepathy and I\nam inclined to agree.\nThe fact that I am mainly the transmitter and not the percipient\nmay be explained on the ground that my work encourages just that\nattitude of mind, in the same way as the work of the medium en-\ncourages the converse attitude, that of reception. Just as the typical\nmedium is a typical recipient, so the typical psychotherapist is more\nlikely to be a transmitter or agent. I just suggest that for further\npossible investigations. It is not entirely in harmony with what\nother people believe. My friend Dr T. W. Mitchell has suggested\nthat the sitter in a mediumistic seance is likely to be subject to slight\ndissociation, and the medium can thus penetrate into his sub-\nconscious, but that is not my general experience.\nIf we accept telepathy, as I think we must, we have to go on to\nconsider the conditions under which it occurs, and only when those\nconditions are known and can be reconstituted is it really justifiable\nto regard telepathy as a proved scientific fact, or at least that would\nbe a certain stage pending the time when we know certain general\nconditions. I probably shall not arouse much opposition in my\naudience if I suggest that one premised condition is passivity on the\npart of the percipient and activity in the unconscious mind of the\nagent. As a rule it is not conscious or voluntary activity on the part\nof the agent that produces the best instances of telepathic communi-\ncation, but a spontaneous surging up of feeling in the agent's mind,\nwhich is not checked in other ways. If he does make a voluntary\neffort he is likely to check the manifestation. I think this is suffi-\nciently probable to explain why in so many cases successes are\napparent at the beginning of the experiments and not later on.\nWhen first a person finds he has apparently telepathic power he is\nenthusiastic about it ; later on he is over-anxious to prove his power\nand fails to do so. The law of reversed effort, which is so important\nto note in suggestion treatment, is at work here.\nI come now to the much more debatable class of supernormal\nphysical phenomena. These phenomena have been extremely\ndifficult to establish because of the great possibilities of fraud and\nconjuring, and of collusion and conspiracy, which are less easy to\ndetect than in the case of mental phenomena.\nPersonally, I used to feel extremely sceptical of physical pheno-\nmena until an event occurred in my own life that convinced me of\nits possibility.^ The first death that occurred in my family was that\nof a little child, two and a half years of age. He died in a nursing\nhome. On the morning of his death I happened to be looking at\n1 Science and Personality, pp. 193, 194.\n\f84 William Brown [part\na clock on the mantelpiece in rooms some distance away, when I\nheard a loud noise behind me, a sudden bang, as the little boy's\nportrait shot off the edge of the piano right across the room. I was\nlooking towards the clock at the time and I noticed that it was\ntwenty minutes to eight. Shortly afterwards a telephone message\narrived informing me that he had died. I told my wife of this cir-\ncumstance on the way to the nursing home, and when we reached\nthe home I asked the nurse at what time the death took place, and\nshe said \" Twenty minutes to eight.\" That happened many years\nago, and it is the kind of event one could not bring oneself to describe\nat the time, as I ought to have done, and send in to the Society,\nwith proper testimony. But I feel no doubt whatever about the\nreliability of my memory, and I am strongly convinced that the\nevent was significant, that it was not merely a chance coincidence.\nTherefore I am prepared\u2014more prepared perhaps than many other\nscientists\u2014to agree with the possibility of telekinesis.\nI have been spending a little time with the medium Rudi\nSchneider.^ I had been disappointed with negative results, but I was\nfortunate at last to be present at a sitting where definite positive\nphenomena occurred. I must testify here that at that sitting I was\nconvinced that the phenomena could not have been normally\nproduced by Rudi Schneider himself, and they seemed to be pro-\nduced from within the curtained-ofE cabinet. There was no evidence\nwhatever to indicate that anyone else in the circle could have had a\nhand in the production of the phenomena. The circle was a small\none, only seven people altogether, with all of whom I had a previous\nacquaintance. Rudi Schneider was adequately controlled by the\nsitter at one end, and I was at the other end of the semicircle. I had\non my right Rudi Schneider's fiancee, and I feel confident she was\nadequately controlled. As I say, the phenomena occurred\u2014the\nappearance and disappearance of flowers and the movement of the\ndetachable top of a small table across the room\u2014and they seemed\nto me to call for a supernormal explanation. But it is one thing to\nget a feeling of conviction, and quite another thing to have an intel-\nlectual conviction. In order to have the latter and to be justified in\npreaching the gospel about it and claiming the evidence as adequate\nevidence of supernormal physical movement, one must have\nadequate knowledge, and that is really the difiiculty. Subsequent\nenquiry and investigation have supplemented my knowledge, and\nstrengthened my feeling that the phenomena were supernormal.\nBut further experiments are needed to produce intellectual\nconviction.\nThere is no question here of my withdrawing or modifying what I\n1 Through the kiadneas of Mr Harry Price, Hon. Director of the National\nLaboratory for Psj'chical Research, to whom my thanks are due.\n\f127] Psychology and Psychical Research 85\nhave previously stated, but, since I had not full knowledge and con-\ntrol, it is incumbent upon me to refuse to go further than my record\nallows. All one can say is that the phenomena occurred, and one is\nbaffled and unable to explain why they occurred. Certainly in my\nview the medium deserves to be the subject of continued investiga-\ntion of the most stringent kind. I would suggest that the only kind\nof investigation likely to convince a scientist with an established\nreputation in other branches of science would be one in which a\nnumber of scientists of established reputation sat again and again\ntogether with the medium in a room of their own choosing, and with\napparatus of their own devising. And I venture to predict that if\nthey then got physically positive results, they alone would believe\nsuch results, and other scientists would refuse to believe them.\nWhien I related my own experience to one of the greatest scientists\nin the world he simply laughed. He agreed that telepathy might\noccur, because that was not so easily disproved, but that an object\nshould be moved at a distance was entirely beyond the bounds of\npossibility.\nYou all know that Dr Eugene Osty^ in Paris has been obtaining\nremarkable results with Rudi Schneider, using infra-red rays.\nApparently Rudi Schneider is able to project or build up at a dis-\ntance an invisible substance which absorbs or reflects the rays, and\nthe degree of absorption oscillates at a rate double that of his breath-\ning. Rudi Schneider when in trance breathes at the rate of 150 to\n300 times a minute, as compared with the normal breathing rate of\n14 or 15 times. Any ordinary person would quickly get apnoea under\nthose conditions ; but he keeps it up on some occasions for two hours\nat a time. Corresponding with that increased frequency of breath-\ning, there is an oscillation in the absorption of these infra-red rays.\nThere one has a definite physical problem which needs and will repay\ninvestigation, and is likely to throw further light on the nature of\ninfra-red rays, if not upon the power of the physical organism to\nproduce changes at a distance.\nIf we may further venture to theorise, provisionally accepting the\nfacts of telekinesis, we have two general possibilities before us. This\npower sent out by the physiological organism in a state of trance\u2014\nthe power of telekinesis\u2014may be a liberating thing, a signal sent\nout which liberates a particular kind of force that has accumulated\nabout the object to be moved ; or it may transmit force. Those are\ntwo quite distinct possibilities. In any case, although there has been\nmuch fraud as regards physical phenomena and physical mediums,\nyet a case like the one I have described leaves us still hopeful of\nfurther discoveries of a genuine and psychically important nature.\n1 Eugene and Marcel Osty, Les Pouvoirs Inconnus de V Esprit sur la Matiere\n(Paris 1932).\n\f86 William Brown [part\nMay I conclude by referring to the general motive that is the\ndriving force for most people in the investigation of psychical\nphenomena, namely, the desire to prove spiritual survival of\nbodily death ? It seems to me that at the present day the evidence\nfor survival which must have most weight with us is the evidence\nfrom philosophical and religious considerations, from the nature of\nthe human mind, the nature of human values, and the extent to\nwhich survival itself would make life and the whole world process\nmore rational. I do think that considerations such as these are\nsufficient to produce in our minds at any rate an active pragmatic\nconviction of survival. On the other hand, psychical research by\nitself can go only a little way, even in its most successful manifes-\ntations. If it were as completely successful as we hope it will be-\ncome, even if a sufficient amount of positive data were assembled,\nthis could only prove the continued existence of mind for some time\nafter the death of the body. It could not prove immortality, and it\ncould not throw very much further light on the nature of the future\nlife. But the opponents of psychical research are very ready to\naccuse those who investigate it of a morbidly intense desire to prove\nsurvival\u2014a desire very intense, although partly subconscious, and\ncapable of producing an illusory feeling of conviction and to disturb\nthe powers cf observation and to falsify data. Actually, of course, it\nseems to me that the scientific researchers are concerned rather with\ngetting scientific evidence to supplement evidence that they all\naccept as really the fundamental groundwork in their religious and\nphilosophical beliefs. Nevertheless, I thinlc I range myself with our\nPresident, Sir Oliver Lodge, in claiming for the evidence that has\nbeen brought forward by the Society for Psychical Research during\nthe last fifty years that it is sufficient to make survival of bodily\ndeath, scientifically speaking, extremely probable.\nThe Chairman (Sir Oliver Lodge) said : We thank Dr Brown\nfor his important communication. His opinion is likely to carry\ngreat weight with the profession to which he belongs and with the\nscientific world in general. He is very cautious, as you see, in his\npronouncements. He has had great experience of a kind which few\nof us have had. He has had to deal with many abnormal cases, and\nhe is impressed with the powers of the subliminal, or whatever we\nchoose to call it, to produce mental phenomena. Recently he seems\nto have been convinced of telekinesis. Well, I am convinced of\ntelekinesis too, and for somewhat the same reason. Though I have\nseen more cases, I think, than he has, I have not seen Rudi Schneider.\nBut I agree with him that if six scientific men saw these phenomena\nand tested them out to the full, while those six would believe in the\nresult, other scientific men would not. Why is this ? It is because\n\f127] Psychology and Psychical Research 87\nthey are so convinced that physical action at a distance is impossible.\nSo am I. But I do not regard telekinesis as physical action at a\ndistance. If a thing moves, it is always because something is in con-\ntact with it and is making it move. The point is to ascertain what\nthat something is. It may be an ectoplasmic emanation from the\nmedium, or from the sitter ; but the effect is not going to be con-\ntrary to the laws of physics. The laws of physics are all right ; it is\nthe laws of physiology that want explaining. We do not know every-\nthing that an organism can do, we have got to find out, and it is\nof no use shutting our minds to experiments which show that an\norganism can do this sort of thing, by saying that it is physically\nimpossible. It is a physical efiect consequent on the presence of\na medium, the movement must be produced in accordance with\nphysical laws and conditions. What other laws there are applicable\nto live things, we do not know. We are not aware of all the laws of\nNature. But there is some kind of energy available either in the\norganism or outside the organism\u2014it may be controlled by discar-\nnate agency,\u2014but there is some form of energy which has moved\nthat thing. It is a very simple phenomenon in itself, it is very easily\nbrought to book, it is more simple than a materialisation, and it is\none of the things which is most easily looked into. I think it may\nbe\u2014I do not know how soon\u2014the physical side of our subject that\nthe scientific world will begin really to study. I want the biologists\nto take it up, especially the physiologists. Until they have had their\nsay, it is not for a mere physicist to speak. The whole thing is an\nextension of physiology.\nWell, that has nothing very much to do with the main subject of\nthe discourse to-night. There is one thing I should like to ask the\nlecturer. He was talking of his experience in France when he had a\nnumber of shell-shocked soldiers as patients, and he found they were\nvery easily hypnotisable. He could induce them to believe at any\nrate that they had a clairvoyant faculty, and in one case he mentioned\nthe man was able to follow his father and mother in a distant city,\nwatch them go along the main street to the cinema, wait with them\nin the queue, and observe the programme and the title of the picture.\nI should like to know whether he verified that, and whether it was\ntrue that that happened, that is to say, whether it was really clair-\nvoyance or all imaginary. If you have an imaginary case of that\nsort, where the patient thinks he has got clairvoyance and has not,\nhow does Dr Brown account for it ? Would he say it was just\nimagination, like dreaming without any cause, or would he say that\nit was the result of reading somebody's mind ?\nDr Brown, in reply, said : I must thank you for hstening so\npatiently to what I fear has been a rather disjoined discourse.\n\f88 William Brown [part 127]\nActually I did wish to end it up by an emphasis upon one particular\nfactor that seems to enter into all this work, namely, as regards\ncommunications possible with the other world. All the evidence\nseems to point to the need of the feeling of love, that love is the\nbridge\u2014that if there is going to be any bridge that will take us from\nthis world to the next, it will be that feeling of love. I cannot help\nthinking that in telepathy, too, there is very often a community\nof feeling between the two people separated by a distance. That\nfeeling can fluctuate, and with it may fluctuate the power of relation-\nship between the one mind and the other.\nSir Oliver Lodge has asked me about the nature of the clair-\nvoyance observed in the war cases. In the particular case I described,\nunfortunately, I was not able to get confirmatory evidence, simply\nbecause the man went down the line, and the repUes never reached\nme. He promised to write to his people and find out from them\nwhether those events had actually been taking place at that par-\nticular time, but he left the casualty clearing station before the reply\ncame, and I heard no more from him. Therefore I have to put that\ncase down as a negative one. One case which I did investigate fully\ngave correspondence, speaking generally, to the extent of about 50\nper cent, though I admit the unit of correspondence is very difiicult\nto fix. My own impression was that the majority of these hysterical\npatients dreamed to order under the influence of suggestion. They\nbecame very suggestable in the hypnotic trance, and if you suggested\nto them that they saw things at home they were likely to do so. But\nin a minority of cases there seemed to be something more than this,\nand my own feeling at the present time is that a certain small num-\nber of people have real mediumistic powers and are able to exert\nthose powers to the best advantage in a state of mild self-hypnosis.\n\f128] Review 119\nmoving for a short distance over the underlying muscles and\nbones. ...\" \" It is, however, clear,\" they add, \" that the hands,\nwhich are not secured at all, have a very considerable latitude of\nmovement, depending on the flexibility of the wrist joints.\" They\ncontinue, \" We [Dr WooUey and Mrs Brackenbury] have made\nexperiments under this method of control [Mrs Brackenbury\nrepresenting the medium] and have satisfied ourselves that it is by\nno means difficult to move the table about and to handle and lift\nup any objects placed upon it.\" They therefore concluded that the\nmethod of control is ineffective.

The investigations of E. and M.\nOsty ^ on Rudi Schneider's phenomena have given a strong lead in\nthe direction of using infra-red rays : it ajopears that these rays are\nfar less inhibitory of the phenomena than rays capable of affecting\nthe eye. In MM. Osty's work, the diminution of intensity of the\ninfra-red beam when partly intercepted by the psychic agency ^ has\nbeen observed. This method, using a photo-electric cell as indi-\ncator, has the great advantage of giving an immediate indication\nof what is happening, as well as allowing a graphic record to be\nmade at the same time. The attempts made so far to combine this\nwith ordinary photography have given the valuable negative result\nof showing that the medium was doing nothing suspicious, but have\nnot shown anything positive. It seems that a flooding of the room\nwith visible light has a prejudicial effect\u2014at all events it was found to\ncause the infra-red beam to pass again in full intensity. The obstruct-\ning agency had apparently melted away under the influence of light.\nGreat improvements in plates for infra-red photography have\nrecently been made by Messrs Ilford, and the idea readily suggests\nitself of flooding the room with infra-red light instead of visual\nlight, and taking a photograph thereby.\nIt will be desirable to consider in the first place in some little\ndetail what is meant by infra-red light, and with what degree of\nperfection it can be separated from visible Light.\nThe term infra-red is somewhat indefinite. If we examine a\nsource, such as a slit in the shutter through a prism, we shall see a\nspectrum which is brightest in the yellow-green region, and less\nbright in the red. The red itself gradually tails off into deep red,\nand then into invisibility : but exactly where complete invisibility\nsets in it is difficult to say. Much will depend on the particular\n^ Les Pouvoirs inconnus de Vesiwit sur la matiere (Paris 1932).\n2 It is not the object of tliis paper to discuss the nature of this agency,\nbut rather to indicate the details of a method of finding out more about it.\nF 89\n\f90 Lord Rayleigh [part\narrangement usetl : i'ur example, if we cut off the brighter parts of\nthe spectrum by using a red glass, we shall see the red of the spectrum\nextending beyond the position at which it would otherwise be lost\n:\nagain the extent of red which can be seen will depend on the bright-\nness of the source.\nCareful experiments made by Helmholtz, with the conditions as\nfavourable as possible, led him to place the limit of visibility at\nthe wave length 8120 Angstrom units, but it is very difficult to see\nas far as this, and conventionally wave lengths somewhat shorter,\nsay from the Fraunhofer line A of the solar spectrum at 7661\nAngstroms, are spoken of as infra-red. It is to be understood,\nhowever, that they are not absolutely invisible, unless the intensity\nis low. On the other hand, if the intensity is low enough, any kind\nof light will become invisible. We see therefore that the distinction\nbetween red and infra-red light is not a very clear one.\nThe distinction is in practice still further blurred by the circum-\nstance that we have no very efiective method of making a clean-cut\nseparation at any particular wave length.^ The resource available\nin practice is to use colour filters, which transmit one v\/ave length\nand suppress another. Such filters can rarely be made to give a\nvery clean cut. There is an intermediate region of the spectrum\nwhere transmission is partial. If we are too particular about cutting\noff all the visible light from a source we may reduce the infra-red\nmore than is desirable.\nThe filter which has usually been employed in infra-red photo-\ngraphic work is cobalt-blue glass, and I do not think it is probable\nthat anything much better can be found. It will seem at first a\nparadox to recommend blue glass, but the blue light transmitted\nis readily cut off by superimposing a red glass upon it. The impor-\ntant point is that cobalt glass cuts off bright red and transmits\ndeep red and infra-red. If we choose a judicious thickness, we shall\nreduce the red to a very small amount, and leave the infra-red\nwithout too serious a diminution. For example, if we take 1 cm.\nthickness of Messrs Schott's blue glass B.G.3, the transmission as\ngiven by the manufacturers' data is as follows :\n1 It is possible to do this effectively for some purposes by means of a spectro-\nscope, but this method sacrifices too much of the light which it is desired to\nretain to be of general use in infra-red photography, except of the spectrum\nitself.\nWave Length Angstroms.

Indeed, it appears that this is not desirable. The ini^ra-red\nsensitivity of the plate has a \" peak \" value at about 8000 Ang-\nstroms, and, as we have seen, visibility extends somewhat beyond\nthis point : so that if we made the source comjjletely invisible we\nshould sacrifice much of the best sensitivity of the plate, which\nsensitivity is for a region venj nearly invisible. This is illustrated\nby Fig. I, the ordinates of which show the sensitivity of the plate,\nwhile the abscissae show the wave lengths. This curve has been\n6,5 7p 7f 8p 815\n9p\nt\nFig. I.\nThe sensitivity of Messrs Iliord's infra-red plate.

I have added an arrow showing\nthe limit of visibility according to Helmholtz.\nAlthough we can see the filament of the lamp, we cannot see\nanything illuminated by it. To illustrate by a more familiar case,\nthe stars themselves appear bright enough. Not so the landscape\nilluminated by them.\nIt will be seen from these considerations that there are practical\ndifficulties in the way of flooding the room with invisible infra-red\nrays of a quality that will allow us to take a photograph with short\nexposure. The trouble is that the kind of infra-red rays to which\nthe available plates are sensitive are not separated from the rays\nwhich are visibly red by a wide enough interval in the spectrum to\nallow of a complete cut. To flood the room with infra-red rays of a\nsuitable quality will inevitably introduce an appreciable amount of\nvisible light along with them. If we wish to take anything like an\ninstantaneous exposure, the amount of visible light will probably\nbe greater than the general experience at mediumistic sittings\nindicates as allowable.\n\f92 Lord Rayleigh [PAET\nIt might seem at first sight as if we had arrived at an impasse,\nbut there is an alternative method. This is to take a silhouette of\nthe invisible substance as it invades the infra-red beam. We take\nit from Osty's experiments that the infra-red of 10,000 A or less\ncan be absorbed and therefore screened o'K by the invisible sub-\nstance to an important extent, and at the same time that this kind\nof radiation can be tolerated. It appears probable therefore that a\nsilhouette can be obtained. The very great advantage of this\nmethod is that the whole of the infra-red beam can be made to\nenter the camera lens and contribute to the formation of a picture.\nContrast this with the more obvious method of photography by an\nextraneous lens of an object bathed in the infra-red beam. In this\ncase we utilise the light diSusely reflected or scattered by the\ninvading object. The light is scattered in all directions. We could\nput a number of cameras over a wide range of positions in the\nroom, and it is obvious that only a very small fraction of the\nscattered light could enter any one of them. Hence the exposure\nrequired is enormously longer than in the other case.\nIt is true that in this way we can only get the outlines of a uni-\nformly opaque object, but at the present stage of the enquiry this\nlimitation may perhaps not be so very serious. A material, such\nas a gauze fabric used for the fraudulent production of \" ectoplasm,\"\nshould show its structure as well by this method as by any other.\nIn order to realise the silhouette method with advantage, we must\nmake use of a field lens which will focus the radiant upon the\ncamera lens. The camera lens will be focussed upon the region in\nfront of the field lens, or upon the field lens itself, the two lenses\nand the radiant being coaxial.\nThe diagram. Fig. II (not drawn to scale), shows the principle.\nThe radiant will not be seen upon the plate, being entirely out of\nfocus. The object will be seen in focus, provided that it is a reason-\nable distance away from the camera lens. This requires that the\nfield lens should be of long focus, several times that of the camera\nlens. One limitation of the method is that the field of view is no\nbigger than the area of the field lens. A lens of very large size is\nexpensive, and may require the use of longer distances than an\nordinary room will allow of.\nThe lens does not require anything like the accuracy of figure\nthat must be given to a telescope objective ; nor is there anything\ngained by making it achromatic, since for one reason amongst\nothers, only red or infra-red light comes into question. A simple\nplate-glass lens of the common greenish-coloured plate-glass answers\nall purposes. The ordinary methods of manufacture give an amply\ngood enough figure. I chose 1 foot diameter for a trial of the method.\nThe lens should be double convex, and it was decided to make the\n\fOn a Metliod of Silhouette Photog^'aphy\n.source:\nFig. II.

This gave an image of 0-9 inch diameter on the\nplate. It is not desirable to make the image of the field lens larger,\nby using a camera lens of longer focus, for if this is done the avail-\nable light will be spread over a larger area, and the exposure will\nhave to be increased accordingly. It is better to enlarge the small\npicture in printing.\nAs already mentioned, the light entering the photographic lens\nis a beam of small cross section, the section of it being an equal-\nsized image of the source. Since the source is small, the full aperture\nof this lens is by no means utilised : in fact, we are virtually using\nthe lens as if it were heav 1\/ stopped down.^ Owing to this virtual\nstopping down of the lens, we get great depth of focus, and in fact\nthe silhouette of a hand or other object held three feet away from\nthe field lens (halfway towards the camera) is quite good, even if\nthe camera is focussed for an object close to the field lens. The size\nof the field is, of course, greatest near the field lens. A coarse wire\ngauze placed there is convenient for focussing.\nThe small picture of 0-9 inch diameter by no means fills a quarter\nplate, and the camera should have what is called a repeating back,\nallowing the dark slide to be slipped along so that three or four\npictures can be taken on the same plate.*\nIt remains only to give details of the source of light, and of the\ninfra-red filters. The source was an incandescent lamp placed in a\n1 The cost of the lens was \u00a35 10s.\n^ If a much larger lens were to be employed, it would be advisable to con-\nsider whether the focal length should not be made less than three times the\ndiameter. The advantage would be in avoiding such long distances. The\ndisadvantage would be a probable increase of cost, and a less satisfactory\nconcentration of the light of the radiant on a small area of the camera lens.\nThis would mean less depth of focus, or, in extreme cases, a failure of illumina-\ntion over part of the field. On the whole it would perhaps be preferable to\nuse the longer focus, and to get over the difficulty of long distance either by\nsetting the lens in the door or wall between two rooms, or by using plane\nmirrors to bend the rays through a right angle or an acute angle. Naturally\nthe best plan would depend on the architectural conditions.\n^ For this reason a lens of large relative aperture f\/4 or f\/2, e.g. offers no\nadvantage in this work.\n* If many pictures were to be taken at a sitting to record the successive\nphases of phenomenon, it would be best to arrange for a long dark sUde taking\nseveral plates end to end. Devices of this kind have been used by astronomers\nin eclipse work, where it is important to avoid the loss of time in changing\nplate holders.\n\f128] On a Metliod of Silhouette Photography 95\nwooden box, with a hole covered by the filter.

I have used\ntwelve-volt lamps taking six watts, but there is, of course, nothing\nspecial about this.\nFig. nr.\nThe filter, as already explained, consists of cobalt blue glass\ncombined with red glass.

It\nrepresents a hand holding a flower. With light suitable to exposure\ntimes of 1\/lOOth of a second, the hand or other object should be\nabsolutely invisible by diffused light if the person to whom the\nhand belongs looks directly at it. It can, however, be faintly seen\nin silhouette on the ground glass of the camera, owing to the con-\ncentration of the rays by the field lens into a small image. The\nfilament of the lamp can also be seen like a deep red star, if looked\nat directly through the filter.\nTo adjust the apparatus, set up the field lens at a distance from\nthe lamp equal to about twice its focal length. Remove the blue\nglasses, leaving the red in position, and find the image of the source\non a piece of paper. Place the camera so that this image falls on\nthe middle of the camera lens. It is important for uniform illumina-\ntion that the whole of the light should enter the camera. Next\nplace a piece of wire gauze as a convenient object in front of the\nfield lens, and focus the camera so that the wire gauze is seen sharply\non the ground glass. The focussing adjustment made with red light\nwill be nearly enough correct for infra-red. Take away the gauze\nand (without altering the focus) make any small movement of the\ncamera as a whole that may be necessary to get the field entirely\nfilled with light. Replace the cobalt glasses.\nIn the use of this arrangement a difficulty will be found which\ndoes not present itself in ordinary photography : how are we to\nknow in the dark whether there is anything in the limited field of\nview to be photographed ? As already mentioned, the shadow\npicture can be faintly seen on the ground glass. A reflex camera\nallows a picture to be taken inunediately after a view on the ground\nglass, and would afford the simplest solution, where it is desired to\navoid the complication and expense of photoelectric apparatus.\nThe reflex camera might even in some respects be found better.\nIn a permanent laboratory or seance-Toom photo-electric apparatus\nshould no doubt be installed. In this case a second incandescent\nlamjj may be placed in the same box and behind the same filter as\nthe lamp used for photography, but say two inches to one side.\nThe image of this lamp will fall two inches to the side of the other\nimage, and a thalofide cell or caesium photoelectric cell sensitive to\nthe infra-red may be placed to receive it (Fig. IV).

In this way a watcher at the\ngalvanometer knows that something is in view, and can give the\nword for a photograph to be taken.\nSince a shadow photograph can be taken in 1\/lOOth of a second,\nit is clear that the cinematograph camera is applicable, if it were\njudged worth the expense of having infra-red cinema film specially\nprepared. In this way the whole development of niediumistic\nphenomena may perhaps be recorded, subject to the limitation of\nthe field of view.\nTo sum up, it is shown that instantaneous shadow photographs\ncan be taken by infra-red rays in what may be described as complete\ndarkness, the shadow-throwing object being absolutely invisible\nwhen viewed directly.

The word is not altogether satisfactory, as so much that is\nlegendary, unproven and fantastical is associated with it ; some-\ntimes therefore I will call the supposed faculty \" intuitive percep-\ntion,\" which does not suggest vision, as does the word clairvoyance,\nand so leaves the mind of the investigator free.\nIn planning this research it was essential to eliminate as much as\npossible those mistakes in technique which had invalidated results\nof much past work, and to try and avoid the two chief obstacles\nwhich have so far prevented progress in experiments.\nThe first, and I think the lesser obstacle is fraud, conscious or\nunconscious ; under this heading we can include selection of results\nand practical joking. This charge of fraud is an inevitable charge\nto be brought against successful experiments, the fact must be\nfaced and the possibility eliminated, however warm may be one's\npersonal faith in the integrity of one's collaborators.\nThe second difficulty is this. We have very limited information\nas to the conditions under which the supposed faculty of clairvoy-\nance can work. There is one condition, however, which in the\nmajority of the recorded cases seems to be present, and that is that\nthe ordinary willed attention is in abeyance, and that the percep-\ntion comes from unconscious sources. In experimental work, there-\nfore, we seem to be in the paradoxical position of appointing a\nspecified moment for a sporadic event, and of trying, by the ordinary\nmethods of attention to induce a perception which most usually\noccurs when attention is withdrawn. Possibly the fact that both\nthese difficulties have seldom been together avoided accounts for\nthe little progress which has been made. In experiments, for\ninstance, where fraud was eliminated, it almost always happened\nthat the attention of the subject was markedly engaged. It seemed\nworth an efiiort to design, therefore, a research where both diffi-\nculties could be met satisfactorily. In the present inquiry I have\nendeavoured to do this by adopting the standpoint of Behaviourist\npsychology, for though we may not agree with the theory of that\nschool, the method may hold new possibilities for studying the\nphenomena investigated in psychical research.\n\f100 Ina Jephsou [part\nThe behavioiirist approacli to j^sychological problems is this :\nthat we can only observe actions, we cannot observe mind or con-\nsciousness ;\nactions, therefore, are the proper subject matter of\npsychology, and it is on these alone that observations should be\nmade. Adopting this view, we proceed to study the observable\nresponses which different situations evoke in living organisms, and\nwhen we correlate our observations we can infer the nature (or at\nleast the reality) of the connections between situations and response.\nA behaviourist research in intuitive perception would be made,\ntherefore, by confronting the organism, the human subject, with a\nseries of situations, and by observing the reactions which he makes\nto them. Further, if we observe that a reaction takes place when\nthere is no possibility that the situation or stimulus can affect the\nsubject through any of the normal channels of sense, we must infer\nthat this relationship between stimulus and response is made\npossible by some other form of perception. In order to make the\nresults susceptible to quantitative analysis, which is essential for\nthe purpose, 1 have again used playing-cards. Critics of experiments\nwith cards object that (even if the intuitive perception of cards were\na possibility) the dull and imemotional nature of a card is enough\nto disqualify it as a stimulus. There is ground for this contention\nin that most clairvoyant experiences seem provoked by events of\ngreat emotional importance, but there is considerable evidence\n(which I shall give shortly) that playing-cards are not completely\nunemotional in their effect\u2014so that if we suppose a clairvoyant per-\nception depends on the emotional disturbance associated with it,\nwe may expect to find, with traces of emotion, traces of perception.\nApart from the clear evidence of experiment, the likelihood that\nthe different card values are closely linked with symbolic meaning\nis strong. All games are, in their nature, a \" play \" on conflicts and\nsituations which in real life are serious, and a system of symbolic\npersonalities and numbers, such as a pack of cards, which has per-\nsisted without much change for so long, must be suspected of very\nclose association with deep-rooted tendencies, and to be psycho-\nlogically significant.\nThese natural inferences as to the emotional value of playing-\ncards are borne out by the large-scale experiments in card-guessing\nreported on from time to time by the S.P.R. It appears that some\ncards are persistently preferred, or have more significance than\nothers, and it is this fact which enables a simple experiment on\nbehaviourist lines to be devised. For if a certain card regularly\narouses a certain reaction in the person contemplating it, and if we\nthen find that the same card rouses the same reaction ivhen normal\nmeans of perception are excluded, we shall be forced to assume some\nother form of interconnection between the cards and the person,\n\f128] A Behaviourist Experiment in Clairvoyance 101\nand that this interconnection can be explained by some hitherto\nunacknowledged form of perception.\nI can best illustrate the general plan of this research by compar-\ning two experiments. The first is an experiment in normal psycho-\nlogy, and the second is \" intuitive psychology \" (not yet an estab-\nlished or respectable science).\nIn the normal psychological experiment the subject is asked to\ndraw a card at random from a pack of playing-cards which are\nlying face upwards before him. The aim of the experiment is to\nshow that more often than not he will choose the cards which he\nlikes, that he responds and acts in a special way to special cards.\nIt is immaterial whether or not he is aware of the preferences\nwhich influence his choice, the experiment will prove that he will\nactually draw the cards he likes best.\nIn the \" intuitive psychological \" experiment the subject is asked\nto draw cards from a pack, but on this occasion the cards will be\nface downwards before him, and the opportunity of normal know-\nledge will be excluded. What will happen ? Will he again be found\nto have drawn the preferred crds ? If intuitive perception is a\nreality, I think we must expect that he will. And if we do find that\nhe has drawn a preponderance of preferred cards, we shall be forced\nto the conclusion that he is unconsciously reacting to an uncon-\nscious knowledge of the cards. He is ignorant both of the fact that\nhe has this knowledge, and that he has been using it, and the\ncapacity might go forever unnoticed, if we did not turn up the cards\nand examine them for signs of a subjective bias.\nThe behaviourist experiment in intuitive perception ' resolves\nitself into the simple task of collecting a large number of cards\ndrawn at random from packs face downwards, and the analysis will\nconsist in discovering whether or no preferred cards are drawn\nmore frequently than unpreferred cards.\nIt would not have been possible to collect a large number of\ndrawn cards simply by asking subjects to draw cards at random\nfrom packs face downwards ; the monotony would have been too\ngreat, and unless some pretext were devised the subjects might\nhave wondered why they were asked to draw, and possibly their\nattention might have been on which cards they drew.\nIn the experiments which follow, therefore, some simple aim,\nsome pretext was given to occupy the players, sufficient to distract\ntheir attention, and to prevent them from guessing the real aim of\nthe research.\nAs I was anxious for the experiment to be made in a rather care-\nfree mood, and not in a serious frame of mind, a series of parties\nwas organised so that the games which I devised might be tried.\nI am deeply indebted to those people who gave parties so that the\n\f102 Ina Jephson [part\nexperiments migtt be made, and to those who collected results for\nme.\nMrs Worsfold, Miss Carruthers, Mr Foster, Dr Broad, all had\nparties at which the games were played. Mr Thomas, the President\nof Oxford University S.P.E.., kindly helped, and two parties took\nplace there. Professor Flugel at University College, and Professor\nMurphy at Columbia University, contributed results, and three\nparties were held at the Rooms of the Society for Psychical Research.\nI made a collection from friends and members of the S.P.R., and\nin this way 592 people drew cards from packs face downwards,\nyielding a total of 33,995 cards ; an average of 574 cards per\nperson. To all these people I owe grateful thanks.\nAll the parties were run on similar lines. Card-tables or tables\nwithout shiny surfaces were placed about the room, and usually an\nappointed scorer sat at each table to record the results. When there\nwere not enough scorers the guests took it in turn to score for each-\nother. The games being more or less fraud-proof, the scorers were\nmerely an added precaution, and an aid to accuracy.\nAs it is not necessary for the reader to know more than the\ngeneral principle of the games, I will here describe only one of them.\nThe principle of the games was the same throughout, different\ngames were invented simply to avoid monotony.\nIn the Card-pairing Experiment the player has a pack of cards\nsorted into the four suits. Each suit is shuffled, and for the first\npart of the game diamonds and hearts are used. The diamonds\nare dealt face downwards in a group, and the hearts are dealt face\ndownwards in another group.\nThe player takes a card at random from the diamonds, looks at\nit, and tries to find its pair from among the heart group.\nThe scorer records both cards on the scoring sheet provided (the\ndiamonds in the diamond column, the hearts in the heart colunm).\nA scoring-sheet, filled in as it might be in play, is given below.\nTable I\nCard-pairing Experiment\nDiamonds.

The choice of the first card alone is\ninnocent of conscious motive and is, therefore, entirely suitable for\nuse as data. All cards drawn subsequent to the first are of doubtful\nvalue for data, for in experiments where the cards are not replaced\nthe odds vary so rapidly and in such a complicated manner that\ncalculations are almost useless.^\nIn the later part of the game where the black suits are dealt out\nwe can only count the first spades as legitimate data, the clubs\n(which are the second cards to be picked up) suffer from the same\ndrawback as do the hearts when the red suits are being tried.\nThe earlier part of the collection was made with fidl packs ;\nlater, with a view to simplifying the results, with the number cards\nin one group, and the court cards in another.\n\" Distance \" series were designed to eliminate the many sources\nof error which occur when the cards are accessible to sight or touch\nof the players.\nThe Report is divided into three parts, dealing respectively with\nCard Preferences, Experiments with Accessible Cards, and Experi-\nments with Cards at a Distance.\nI must first give the necessary information as to the subject of\ncard-preferences, for it is only when we have definite information\nabout these that we shall be able to tell whether similar preferences\ncan be observed amongst cards drawn.\n^ It sometimes happened that the pair card had been drawn earlier in the\nseries of five, thus :\nD H\n1st pair - - Q 7\n2nd \u201e - - 3 2\n3rd \u201e . . 7\nIn such case the player is allowed to try for the next value either above or\nbelow, i.e. either a 6 or an 8. It was quite immaterial as success in pairing\nwas not the aim of the experiment. The rule was made simply for the smooth\nrunning of the game for subjects who were trying to pair the cards.\n\f104 Ina Jepkson [part\nThese psychological habits are of great interest, I think, quite\napart from the use to which they are put in this research. The\ninformation which we have, and the data which is used in this\nresearch is derived entirely from card-guessing experiments made\nby the S.P.R. and published in Proceedings. Three large-scale\nexperiments in card-guessing go to make up the total, consisting of\nthe following groups }\nJephson - 6000\nJoint - - 9449\nB.B.C. - - 38877\nmaking a total of 54326 Card-guesses\nIn all these series the subject was asked to guess an unseen card,\nand to write down his guess, and in this way a large collection of\nrecorded guesses was made. From the conditions of experiment\nwe can assume that in the majority of cases the subject wrote down\nthe card which first \" came into his head.\"\nWe can also assume that the guesses were not influenced by\ntelepathy or clairvoyance. The results of the Jephson experiment,\nwhich seemed to show signs of clairvoyance, were not done under\ntest conditions, and were not confirmed by the Joint Experiment.\nNo success was achieved in the B.B.C. series, and the remarkable\nconsistency of preference between all four suits and all three series\nis such clear evidence of widespread and persistent mental habits,\nthat we can legitimately take the figures as representative, and use\nthem as our standard of comparison.\nSo that the reader may familiarise himself with the preferences\nexpressed in the recorded experiment, I print Table 11.\nIn almost all religions, in all mythologies, the numbers 3, 5, 7, 9\nhave considerable mystical or magical import. It seems inherent\nin our very make-up to feel that certain numbers have importance\nand meaning, and though we are quite ignorant as to the psycho-\nlogical roots of these preferences, it is not a very daring theory to\nassume that they are probably closely linked with the very structure\nof our being, and basic to human nature. In this particular series,\nthe preferences for 3, 5, 7, 9 compete with the usual values of the\ncards from the point of view of play, so that the ten and the Court\ncards receive comparatively little attention.\n1 Ina Jephson, \" Evidence of Clairvoyance in Card-guessing : a Report on\nsome recent Experiments,\" Proc.

A. Fisher, F.R.S., whose\nvakiable help liad made possible the statistical treatment of my\npast experiments with cards, and asked what degree of agreement,\nwhat correlation (if any) there was between the frequencies of cards\ndrawn and the preferences expressed in the standard series.\nDr Fisher replied as follows :\n\" I have come to the conclusion that the correlation method\nmakes a very artificial approach to your problem, since the 13\nvalues in a suit cannot be really regarded as a random sample of\nany objective population of possible values. It seems to me more\ndirect to consider whether the 13 frequencies observed differ signifi-\ncantly from equality, a x' ^^^t with twelve degrees of freedom,\nand if so, whether the particular component of deviation which is\nproportional to the deviations of your standard preferences, is itself\nsignificant, which reduces to a test with one degree of freedom, a\nselected one out of the twelve available. For example, your series B\n[Table III, first column] headed all first cards drawn scores 13-101\nfor the 12 degrees of freedom, the expected value being 12, and the\nvalue observed not greater than would often occur by chance, so\nthat this series from 170 threes to 126 Queens is not more variable\nthan one would expect from 1937 cards drawn at random. This\nincludes all difierences in frequency, and not only those differences\nwhich conform to the standard preferences. If we confine attention\nto the one component which measures conformity with these prefer-\nences, we have a positive component contributing -6415 to the total,\nthe expectation being unity, the conformity is, of course, not signi-\nficant, although on the whole the preference cards have been drawn\nmore frequently than those not preferred.\n\" With respect to Table C [Table III, second column], the fre-\nquencies are distinctly more equal than one ought to find in 18,644\nindependent drawings, for the 12 degrees of freedom is only\n4-726, which is subnormal, and arises from the cards having been\ndrawn without replacement.\"\nThe next collection to be analysed consists of the games which\nwere played with the number cards alone, and a small series made\nonly with the court cards. I devised a simple game with the court\ncards, as I thought it possible that the King might continue to be\ndrawn with a high frequency, and wished for further opportunity\nto test this.\nThe results are as follows ; the odd cards are still leading. The\nAce, in the first cards drawn, keeps a perilous lead, beating an out-\nsider, the 8, by only one card.\n\f108 Ina Jephson [part\nTable V\nFirst Cards. Subsequent Cards.

However, 8102 cards were drawn in this way, with\nresults which I shall describe.\nIn all these games the cards were out of sight of the players, and\n\f110 Ina Jephson [part\nchosen by tliem by position on a given plan. A \" dealer \" was ap-\npointed, who dealt out the cards face downwards on a similar plan.\nThe first of these games to be tried was the \" clock \" experiment,\ntwelve cards being laid out in the positions of hours on a clock.\nEach player was given a score-sheet on which was printed a\nseries of spaces in the positions of the hours on a clock-face.\nBefore the experiment began it was explained that, out of sight,\nthe cards (six red cards and six black) would be shuffled and dealt\nout at random on the plan shown in the score-sheet, no one knowing\nin which positions any of the cards lay. The cards were the 1, 2, 3,\n4, 5, 6 of diamonds and spades.\nThe players were asked to imagine that they could \" clair-\nvoyantly \" know how the cards lay, and to try and find pairs of a\nsimilar colour. Each player was allowed to try for five couples.\nHe marked his first pair chosen \" A \" on the plan given to him,\nand his second choice \" B \" \" B,\" and so on.\nAs soon as the players have made their selections, the dealer\nturns up the cards in their places, and marks them on his score-\nsheet plan. Later, by using this key-plan, it is easy to discover from\nthe players' records, which cards were chosen by the players.\nThirty-three people took part in this clock experiment, and if we\nanalyse the first or \" A \" cards we get the following result\n:\nAce - - 18\n2 - - 14\n3 - - 11\n4 - - 8\n5 - - 8\n6 - -\n_7\n66\nthat is, 37 odd numbers and 29 even. Of these, 42 were red cards\nand 24 black. In the total results, odds and evens were chosen\nwith equal frequency, and two more black cards drawn than red.\nThis result for the first cards drawn, showing all the tendencies\nfor which I hope, a high frequency for ace, odd numbers and red\ncards, may seem hopeful, but unfortunately there may be a per-\nfectly normal reason for the success, which is this. When a choice\nis made from a series of positions on a given plan, we discover at\nonce that there is a defijiite tendency to prefer some positions to\nothers, and that this tendency is very general, and definite enough\nto be observable even in a small number of choices. Their presence\nwill cause no surprise, and reasons for them can in many cases be\neasily surmised. The reading habit with these subjects, for instance,\nmay determine that the first choice in a linear series be the first\nposition on the left-hand top corner, and so on.\n\f128] A Behaviourist Experiment in Clairvoyance 111\nIt follows, therefore, that if chance has placed a preferred card\nin a preferred position in a plan, that it will be more often chosen\nthan it would be by pure chance. To take a concrete instance, if\nan ace happens to be dealt in the top left-hand position (the favoured\nposition in a plan), the choice of that position will automatically\nensure the choice of an ace, and numerous choices of that position\nwill ensure the choice of numerous aces. We can, of course, dodge\nthe difficulty by providing the players with enough deals to ensure\nthat chance gives a different card by turn in the various positions.\nUnfortunately, it was never possible at the parties where the games\nwere played, to arrange that each player had a different deal from\nwhich to choose, so in the bulk of the experiments, choices were made\non one deal, by groups of people numbering from 30 to 70 players.\nIn the clock experiment which has been described, we find on\nexamining the lay-out of the cards that Dr WooUey, who was dealer\non this occasion, though he shuffled the cards and dealt them out\nat random (face downwards), began with an ace on the 12 o'clock\nposition, and dealt the red cards on the upper part of the plan. As\nthe natural instinct on choosing positions from a circular plan is to\nstart with the positions in the upper part of it, the frequency of\nace and red cards in the results can be easily explained.\nThe next experiment was made as follows, and was a slight im-\nprovement on the clock experiment, as there were a larger number\nof deals from which choice was made.\nIt was called the \" Distance Card-pairing Experiment,\" and was\nclosely similar to the card-pairing game which has already been\ndescribed in the section on accessible cards.\nFor this game first the two red suits and then the two black ones\nwere set out in four rows, three of three cards and one of four.\nAgain no one knew in which positions any of the cards lay.\nThe players were told that the cards had been dealt out, and were\nasked to imagine that they could, after choosing at random a card\nfrom the heart group, intuitively discover the pair to it in the\ndiamond group. They marked their first choice A in the diamond\ngroup, and their second choice A in the heart group. Five diamonds\nand five hearts were chosen in this way, and marked respectively\nA A, B B, etc.\nThe players having recorded their choice, the dealer turned up\nthe cards in their places and recorded them on his score-sheet.\nIn this experiment 7398 cards were chosen, and chance favoured\nthe results in a remarkable way. We can count as valid for data\nall the first cards which were drawn in each suit. In the card-\npairing experiment, where the cards were accessible, we could only\ncoimt the very first card which was taken in each^ pairing effort,\nthat is, the diamonds in the red suits, and the spades in the black,\n\f112 Ina Je-phson [part\nfor in that game the players looked at the first card they picked up,\nand then tried to find its pair, so normal knowledge might con-\ntribute to the finding of the second pair. In the distance series the\nproblem is to find \" likeness \" amongst cards none of which are seen,\nso neither fraud nor an accidental sight of the cards was possible.\nNaturally the first card picked in each suit offers the most satis-\nfactory material from the mathematical point of view ; as the odds\nare changed when cards are chosen without replacement.\nThe following tables give the information as to cards drawn in\nthis Distance series.\nTable VII\nA.

The very close correlation between\nthe cards chosen and the Standard Preference Series is easily seen\nby Diagram I, where the dotted line gives the cards chosen.\nDr Fisher reports on the results as follows : \"In Table A 3 [Table\nVII C] the frequencies difier much more than they would in 748\ncards drawn independently ^ and at random. The twelve degrees of\nfreedom score 50-5267, and of this the preference component con-\ntributes 24-1360, a very marked preference, nearly five times its\nstandard error, and quite clearly significant. Series A 1 and A 2\n[Table VII A and B] are not positively correlated.\nThe cards subsequently chosen in Table A 4 [Table VII D] do\nnot diiler from random expectation. Their twelve degrees score\n14-5468 and the preference component contributes 0-2594, a positive\npreference of about half its standard error, though judging from\nthe' table for subsequent cards drawn in the Accessible Series I have\nover-estimated the Standard Error owing to non-replacement of\nthe cards. However, the fact that the preference component con-\ntributes less than a twelfth of the total shows that there is nothing\nin it, apart from the fact that it is positive.\"\nThe significant figures achieved by the first cards drawn made it\nnecessary to analyse the conditions of experiment to discover\nwhether again the preferred cards by chance had occupied the pre-\nferred positions. It was unfortunately not possible to get informa-\ntion as to all the deals involved in this group, as in some cases,\nbefore the importance of the point had been realised, only those\ncards which lay in positions which had been chosen were recorded,\nand not (as should have been done) all the cards in all the positions.\nHowever, the number of deals recorded, and the number of choices\nmade on them is enough to give sufficient data to illustrate how\nchance could influence the results. Of the Table VII C, giving 1496\ncards, 1352 had been made on the deals which I give the details.\n(The 144 cards which make up the balance were chosen in experi-\nments where the deals were not always fully recorded.)\nWhen the plans were examined it was found that the choice had\nfallen very heavily on certain positions. On the top left-hand\nposition, for instance, ninety-two choices were made, as against only\nfive for the lowest right-hand position in the same little group.\nNow, by chance, in the twenty-four deals made the ace was five\ntimes put in the preferred position by five different dealers. The\nseven was laid in the fifth position (another popular place) on five\ndifferent occasions. This purely chance arrangement led naturally\nto a high frequency for ace and seven amongst the cards chosen,\nand can account for the significant correlation with the Standard\nPreference series which was achieved in this experiment.\n1 As to independence, however, see below.\n\f114 Ina JepJisov [part 128\nThe experiment, therefore, can only serve as a guide to designing\nfuture experiments, and the method can be made satisfactory and\nfree from the drawbacks introduced by position habits if we arrange\nthat each player has a different deal laid out on the plan, from\nwhich to make his choice. For in the long run, though position\nhabits would persist, chance must eventually place different cards\nin the different positions, so that if the players continued to draw\npreferred cards with a high frequency, it would be valid evidence\nthat Intuitive Perception was at work.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that statistically these experiments\nprovide no support for my theory, except where there were acci-\ndental flaws in the procedure. From this conclusion there is no\nescape. At the same time I still think that there is a prima facie\npsychological case for the supposition that clairvoyance is to some\nextent influenced by more or less subconscious preferences, and that\nthere is a case for further investigation.\nBefore I end I woidd like to make one point clear, and that is\nthat, though the research was made in cards, they were chosen\nsimply as a handy and statistical material on which to try the\nhypothetical faculty. If the faculty is a reality it must certainly\nbe exercised in less trivial directions. If and when it is so exercised\nit is logical to presume that preference again will determine the\nfacts perceived. The phenomena of mediumistic activity which\npossibly most nearly resembles these experiments are \" booktests.\"\nHere relevance and significance either for the sitter or for the\nsupposed communicator are of the very essence of the event. If\nwe examine the recorded cases of spontaneous intuitive perception\n(either clairvoyance or telepathy), the effective range of the faculty\nseems again to be fairly narrowly determined by significance or\npreference. In the majority of recorded cases the \" seer \" becomes\naware of some danger or difiiculty to someone with whom he has\nstrong ties of affection. A large assembly can be made of the intui-\ntive discovery of lost valuables. Lost wills are found which in\nevery case, I think, benefit the seer.\nI would again like to thank the many people whose co-operation\nmade this research possible, particularly Miss Newton and Mr\nBesterman, who helped on many occasions in many capacities ;\nDr Fisher for his open-minded and patient consideration of my\nrather eccentric problems, and for his statistical help ; and Mr Soal\nfor his help in statistical matters.\n\fREVIEW.\nThe Boston Society for Psychic Research, Bulletin XVIII.\nOctober 1932.\nThis Bulletin, of seventeen pages in double cohimns and iUustra-\ntions, deals with finger-prints, or rather thumb-prints, obtained at\nsittings with the medium known as Margery ^ on tablets of Kerr\ndental wax, and claimed by Margeri\/s Control \" Walter \" as his\nown. He materialises his thumb, he says, as it was in life, and\nimpresses it, while the seance-room is dark, on the wax provided by\nthe sitters, which is softened to the necessary extent by them,\nunder \" Walter's \" direction, in hot water. \" Walter \" is alleged\nto be Margery s brother who died in 1911 by an accident, and the\nwax finger-prints, said to be recognised as his, are recognised by\ncomparing them with faint finger-prints on a razor handle belong-\ning to him, and put away by his mother among other small posses-\nsions after his death. Some of those who have examined this two-\ndimensional print on the razor handle, while accepting that it was\nreally made unintentionally by \" Walter \" when alive, consider it,\nI understand, to be too faint and incomplete to serve efficiently as\na mark of identity of pattern with the wax \" Walter \" prints pro-\nduced at sittings.^\nThe Bulletin under review contains three articles, all bearing on\nthe subject of \" Walter's \" thumb-prints, these thumb-prints hav-\ning excited considerable interest in the world of psychical research\never since the experiments in their production began in 1927. The\nfirst and longest of the three articles is by Mr E. E. Dudley, a\nmember of the American Society (A.S.P.R.), who had also for\nseveral years been an active member of their research committee ;\nhe had published voluminously on the subject of the \" Walter\n\"\n1 Margery's (Mrs Crandon's) mediumship is doubtless well known by\nreputation to most of our readers, and they will recall Mr Dingwall's investiga-\ntion of it on behalf of our Society in the early part of 1926, of which a Report\nwas published in vol. xxxvi of our Proceedings. That was before the develop-\nment of wax impressions of \" Walter's \" thumbs.\n2 I need hardly remind the reader that the skin patterns on our fingers and\nthumbs are individual and identifiable for each of us. For no two persons\nare they exactly alike, so that if two impressions of a finger or thumb corres-\npond exactly in details it must be assumed that they are both impressions of\nthe same digit. And so certain is this that the fact can be made use of in\ncriminal investigations.\n115\n\f116 Review [part\nthumb-prints, and had assumed their genuineness. There were\nlong papers by him, alone or in conjunction with Mr Bird, then the\nResearch Officer of the A.S.P.R., in the journal of that society\nduring 1928 and 1929. It struck Mr Dudley that there ought to be\na record at the A.S.P.R.'s office of the finger-prints of sitters\u2014at\nany rate of frequent sitters at Margeri\/s sittings\u2014and he set himself\nto collect them. Among finger-prints of recent sitters none resembl-\ning \" Walter's \" was found. But carrying the investigation further\nback, Mr Dudley got into touch with a Mr Kerivin (pseudonym),\nwho has been present at a number of sittings prior to 1925, though\nnot recently, and who, when informed of the nature of the inquiry,\nwillingly pressed his fingers and thumbs on the back of a sheet of\nhis notepaper (p. 1). Mr Dudley had these prints developed and\nfixed by an expert less than two hours after they were made. A\ncomplete set of ink prints were made two days later, on March 9,\n1932, and enlarged photographs of them compared with enlarge-\nments of wax prints of the right and left thumbs, respectively,\nclaimed as \" Walters.\" These enlarged prints were immediately\n(March 14) submitted to two experienced finger-print experts, who\npromptly agreed that the identification had been established.^\nA brief statement of the facts of this identification was submitted\nto the A.S.P.R for publication by Mr Dudley on June 13, 1932\n(p. 3). The A.S.P.R. did not publish this statement, but Mr Dudley\nwas informed that \" the identification was being discussed . . .\n;\nthat there were implications that the evidence was not authentic,\nand that the writer [Mr Dudley] had an ulterior motive in presenting\nthe facts at all \"\n(pp. 3-4). Mr Dudley naturally felt that he must\ndefend himself against such charges, and most of the remaining\npart of his article in the Boston Bulletin is devoted (pp. 4-9) to\nevidence of the facts of the identification and authenticity of the\nwax imprints said to be of \" Walter's \" thumbs, used by him (Mr\nDudley) in his statement.\nMr Dudley also referred his case to two members of the publication\ncommittee of the American Society, who after investigation \" soon\nwere forced to admit the truth of Mr Dudley's unhappy discovery\n\"\n(p. 10), and one of them, Mr Arthur Goadby, a trustee of the A.S.P.R.\nand also previously a believer in the genuineness of the \" Walter\n\"\nfinger-prints, is the author of the second article in the Bulletin we\nare reviewing, which gives a short but very clear account of the\nmatter under discussion (pp. 10-13).\n1 This gentleman preferred that his true name should not appear in Mr\nDudley's statement for publication, but (see p. 2 of the Bulletin) made no\nobjection to its being filed with the trustees of the A.S.P.R.\n^ I omit the tedious but important points in the examination and com-\nparison of finger-prints.\n\f128] Review 117\nIn the meanwhile the American Society's research committee had\nreceived what Mr Goadby calls Mr Dudley's \" certified and well-\ndocumented report\" for publication in their Journal. They did\nnot publish it, but in the number for July 1932 published \" a\nStatement on behalf of the Kesearch Committee.\" This statement,\nintended by the Committee as a reply to a document which they do\nnot print, is regrettably vague and obscure, but the position seems\nto be as follows :\n1. It is no longer suggested that the prints submitted by Mr\nDudley as Mr Kerwin's were not in fact such.\n2. It is contended that the \" Walter \" right thumb impression\nwith which Mr Dudley compares a Kerwin right thumbprint, is a\npositive, the Kerwin print being, of course, a negative, and that\ntherefore the supposed identity fails. The Research Committee,\nhowever, of the American Society, had hitherto classified this im-\npression as a negative.\n3. It is contended that the \" Walter \" left thumb impression put\nin evidence by Mr Dudley was \" unique,\" other impressions of\n\" Walter's \" left thumb not showing any resemblance to the Kerwin\nleft thumb-print. \" Walter \" has in fact only claimed to have made\nfour impressions of his left thumb (impressions of his right being\nmuch more numerous). Three of these were made at one sitting,\non August 23, 1927. Of these Mr Dudley put in evidence one which\nhad long been accepted as authentic by the American Society's\nofficials. Now, however, that its authenticity was disputed it was\nobviously important to compare it with one of the other two impres-\nsions made at that sitting and afterwards given to sitters. It is\nwith this point that Mr Carrington deals in the third paper included\nin the Bulletin. Mr Carrington, our readers may be reminded, was\nthe member of the Scientific American Committee who to a certain\ndegree dissented from the unfavourable verdict of his colleagues\nconcerning Margery's phenomena.\nOne of the sitters who had received a wax impression on August 23,\n1927, was a Mr Hutchinson of Cincinnati, who was supposed since\nto have died. Fortunately Mr Carrington found that he was not\nonly alive, but had carefully preserved the wax impression, and this\nhe forwarded to Mr Carrington. When examined it was found to\nagree exactly with the impression put in evidence by Mr Dudley,\nso that the suggestion put forward by the Research Committee that\nthe latter was unique or unauthentic appears groundless.\nThe Committee conclude their statement by saying that \" despite\nany discussion that may be indulged in by others in the meantime\nthey will make no further statement in regard thereto until the\ninvestigation [which they are making] is completed and all the facts\ncovered in an adequate scientific report.\" So we need not expect\n\f118 Review [part\nan answer till some moment wlien it seems to them convenient to\nsend it.\nMr Carrington ends his article with the sentence (p. 17), \"... for\nsix years, '\nWalter '\nhas persistently claimed these as Ms own thumb\nprints, whereas painstaking investigation has shown them to belong\nto a living man\u2014and the very man who supplied Margery with the\noriginal Kerr, showed her how to make thumb prints in it, and gave\nher three-dimensional prints of his own thumbs.\" I do not know\nwhat Mr Carrington' s authority for the whole of this sentence is,\nbut it agrees well with the following in Mr Dudley's article (p. 2) :\n\" On March 14th the enlarged photographs were also shown to the\nman whose ridge patterns had been duplicated in wax. It is doubt-\nful if anyone could have been more surprised. Quite naturally, he\nwas somewhat perturbed on learning that approximate replicas of\nhis right thumb print had been well-distributed over the world as\nthe prints of a ghost's thumb. ... In response to a question, he\nstated that he had made his prints in wax (presumably of his thumbs)\nfor Margery, and in reply to a further question as to what had been\ndone with them, suggested :\n'\nYou had better ask Margery what she\ndid with them.' Margery, while admitting that such prints had\nbeen made, asserted that she had never had them.\"\nIt is obvious that if Margery ever had uncontrolled possession for\na short time of these prints she might have made from them casts\nof plaster or other suitable material which would serve as \" Walter's\n\"\nthumbs, from which again wax models might be made ad infinitum.\nIt will be said here perhaps that adequate measures are always\ntaken at the sittings to prevent Margery having the free use of her\nhands, and that without this no manipulation of the wax could be\ndone by her. This may be so at some times and not at others, or it\nmay never be so. An observation made by Dr Woolley and Mrs\nBrackenbury in our own S.P.R. seance-room {Proceedings, xxxix\n358) is of importance here. In December 1929 Dr and Mrs Crandon\n(Margery) visited England and borrowed our seance-room for\ndemonstration experiments in the Ma.rgery mediixmship. Dr\nWoolley and Mrs Brackenbury were invited to attend as observers.\nThe procedure in connection with the inquiry, arranged of course\nby Dr Crandon, was understood to be the same as that employed\nin the sittings which usually take place at Boston. It consists in\nthe main in the attachment of the wrists and ankles of the medium\nto the arms and legs of the chair in which she sits by a number of\nturns of adhesive tape. I need not here go into the further details\ngiven in the article in our Proceedings, as the writers of it agree with\nDr Crandon \" that his method does secure the wrists and ankles\nfirmly to the chair so that no movement is allowed to the lower\nends of the forearms beyond what is allowed through the skin\n\fREPORT OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO SPIRIT-\nPHOTOGRAPHY.i\nBy Fred Barlow and Major W. Rampling-Rose.\nI. By Fred Barlow.\nTo the investigator spirit-photography offers certain advantages\nover most types of psychic phenomena in that one can rule out\ntelepathic and subconscious theories and get to grips right away\nwith the question as to whether these photographic effects are\ngenuine or whether they are fraudulently produced. On the other\nhand, there is at least one very distinct disadvantage in that for an\nessential part of the experiment a dark room is necessary, so that if\none is up against deception it is more difficult to detect. An\nadditional disadvantage is that before arriving at the final results,\nthe photographic plates registering those results have to go through\nso man}\" different processes\u2014in and out of boxes, in and out of dark\nslides, in and out of the camera, in and out of solutions and so on,\nand at every single step there is a loophole for fraud. Such being\nthe case, even an experienced photographer may be easily deceived,\nand the majority of sitters are at the mercy of an unscrupulous\nmedium, although they may consider they are sitting under test\nconditions.\nI find myself in a somewhat unenviable position. As many\nreaders of this paper will know, I was at one time a very strenuous\nadvocate for what I thought was the reality and genuineness of\nsupernormal photography. After taking part in scores of experi-\nments and after the expenditure of a great deal of time and thought\nI had reached the conclusion that there were such things as genuine\npsychic photographs, and I felt it my duty to defend supernormal\nphotography and the mediums on every possible occasion.\nTo-day the position is altered. Instead of defending spirit-\nphotography I have cause to criticise it very adversely, and this, I\nmuch regret to say, will bring me into conflict with many good friends\nof the past. I cannot be accused of lack of experience or of having\nreached a hasty conclusion, and I want to mention very briefly the\ncauses that have led to this change in my views.\nAbout nine years ago a new spirit-photographer came into being.\nHis name was George Moss. After securing some remarkable\n1 Read at a Private Meeting of the Society, 30 November 1932.\nG 121\n\f122 Fred Barlow [part\nresults at Manchester, his reputation became such that the British\nCollege of Psychic Science felt justified in providing him with\npermanent accommodation on their premises. Everything went\nalong very well ; no suspicions were aroused, and it was claimed\nthat the best evidence of his genuineness was that afforded by the\nvery large number of recognised extraneous likenesses that appeared\non his photographic plates. I wish to emphasise this point. You\nwill find many cases detailed in the College journal Psychic Science\nin 1925, and it was contended that the percentage of recognised\nlikenesses obtained by Moss was higher than that obtained at Crewe\nor through the mediumship of Mrs Deane. I had a sitting at the\nCollege with Moss and secured what was apparently a supernormal\nresult. Everything appeared to be all right. The only snag was\nthat Moss claimed that it was necessary for him to have the sensitive\nplates beforehand for \" magnetisation \". So far as one could tell\nat the time we came to use the plates, the packets had not been\ninterfered with.\nSome photographic mediums claim that it is necessary for them\nto have the photographic plates in their possession some days before\nusing them, in order that they may become impregnated with their\naura or magnetism\u2014hence the expression\n'\n' magnetisation \" . It will\nbe seen that this practice lends itself to trickery on the part of a\nfraudulent medium.\nThrough the courtesy of Mr Hewat Mackenzie I was able eventu-\nally to arrange for Moss to pay a visit to Birmingham for experi-\nmental purposes. Again everything seemed to go along all right\nMoss was of a friendly disposition and appeared open and anxious\nto co-operate in the investigation of these phenomena.\nWe tried numerous experiments with ordinary cameras and with\na cinema camera, but in no instance were we successful unless we\nwere using plates previously \" magnetised \" by Moss. Immediately\nupon his return to London I began very carefully to examine his\nresults. The outer coverings of the boxes of plates we had used\nhad been kept on one side. In opening the packets I had cut them\ndown the centre so that I could examine them carefully at my\nleisure. A careful examination of the plate-wrappings showed\nthat these had been very skilfully opened and re-sealed. All those\nnegatives on which extraneous faces appeared had the edge of the\nplate abraded. On those plates that showed no results there was\nno rough edge. I examined at the Psychic College a large number\nof negatives produced by Moss, with the same result. The object\nof the roughened edge of the plate will be obvious. It served as a\nguide in inserting the plate in the shde the right way up, so that the\n\" spirit \" should not appear on the photograph upside down.\nMoss was taxed with fraud, and after attempting to bluff it out\n\f129] Report of an Investigation into Spirit-Photography 123\nhe fuUv confessed.\" That was the end of his career as a medium.\nHe made one mistake in roughing the edges of his plates. If he\nhad not done this in every case, he might probably have got away\nwith it and have had a successful career as a photographic sensitive.\nIt was about this time (June 1925) that certain information was\ndivulged to me in regard to Hope, which, coming immediately after\nthe Moss episode, caused me very considerably to modify my views\non the genuineness of psychic photography. I do not feel I ought\nat this juncture to publish any detailed statement, as the friend who\ngave me this information is now dead. I can only say that my\ninformant, who was a professing spiritualist with considerable\nexperience in all aspects of psychic phenomena, observed certain\nvery suspicious circumstances at some sittings with Hope conducted\nby my friend on his own premises. I have given to the officials of\nthe S.P.R. a full statement of what I learnt, together with a letter\nfrom my friend's wife, confirming the fact of his discoveries.\nYou will readily understand that this information caused me some\nconcern, but I decided to continue my investigations quietly with\nthe Crewe circle in the hope of being able to obtain further definite\npersonal proof one way or the other.\nThrough the S.P.R. I was very fortunate in having as a colleague,\nin some later experiments. Major Rampling-Rose, whom I already\nknew as an expert in photographic matters. So as not to prejudice\nMajor Rose in any way I told him nothing of the suspicions aroused\nin my mind by my friend's revelations. Major Rose will explain\nour reasons for concluding that we have not obtained a single genuine\nresult during our joint experiments at Crewe. On the contrary, the\nevidence suggests that all the results we have obtained are of a\nfraudulent nature, and the views of Major Rose and myself on this\nmatter are in absolute agreement.\nOur paper will deal principally with the Crewe circle because\nthey are by far the most noted mediums for these phenomena and\nthey have been practising for more than 25 years. I do not\nknow why it should be called the Crewe circle, for it simply boils\ndown to one individual\u2014Mr WilUam Hope. Billy Hope, as he is\ncalled, is an impulsive little man of about 70. I had always been\non very friendly terms with him up to the time of telling him\nquite candidly our conclusions and offering him an opportunity\nof proving that he could produce a genuine result. Needless to\nsay, he did not take this opportunity. Hope appears to be that\npsychological curiosity\u2014a man with a dual personality. On\nthe one side of his character there is the alert and witty north-\ncountry man of genial disposition\u2014a simple Salvationist who\nwould be considered the last person in the world to deceive. On\n2 Cp. Journ. S.P.R. (1926), xxiii. 71-3.\no 2\n\f124 Fred Barlow [part\nthe other side appears the bogus medium who uses his prayers and\npsalm-singing as a cloak to cover his guilty operations.\nThere is a Mrs Buxton associated with Hope in this work. Usually\nthe sittings at Crewe take place in her home, as Hope has no con-\nvenience for this at his house. My personal view is that Mrs\nBuxton firmly believes that Hope is genuine, and that nothing will\nshake that belief.\nIt is imnecessary in this paper to give an historical survey of the\nearly days of spirit photography. This has already been done in a\nvery efficient manner by Mrs Henry Sidgwick in her paper published\nin vol. vii of Proceedings (1891). Speaking generally, there have\nbeen many accusations of fraud\u2014some of which have been admitted\nby the mediums, who, however, have still carried on their work after\nthe confession.\nI am going to refer to the supposed supernormal results as\n\" extras \"\n\u2014this is a non-committal word which I do not like, but\nit is the name invariably applied by Mr Hope. Curiously enough,\nit is of American origin, and is applied to fake faces superimposed\non a photograph or film.\nThere is no doubt that the whole fabric of the evidence for the\nreality of psychic photography is based on the claim that on many\noccasions sitters who were quite unknown to the mediums have\nobtained \" extras \" of dead friends or relatives which could not\npossibly have been prepared in advance. This claim I myself once\nmade, and if it could be substantiated the supporters of the reaUty\nof psychic photography would be in an impregnable position.\nRecognised likenesses have been produced, but in every single\ncase I have investigated, where there is no doubt as to the likeness,\nthe \" extra \" has been an exact copy of some existing photograph\nor painting. The proportion of cases in which the identification of\nthe '\n' extra\n'\n' is certain is very small\u2014perhaps one in a thousand\u2014but\neven such a small percentage, or even one in ten thousand, if obtained\nunder conditions precluding fraud, would be sufficient to establish the\ngenuineness of psychic photography. In no instance that I have\ninvestigated, where such definitely recognised \" extras \" have been\nobtained, have I been able completely to satisfy myself that the\nmedium did not have an opportunity of faking the picture before-\nhand.\nTake my own case\u2014the number of times I have been photo-\ngraphed by mediums for spirit photography and have secured\n\" extras \"'\nruns well into four figures. On two occasions only have I\nobtained a result which I considered I could recognise. Of these\ntwo occasions the first was when I thought I was fortunate enough\nto secure through Mrs Deane a likeness of my father. This \" extra\n\"\nI still consider bears a remarkable likeness to my father, but I must\n\fPLATE I\nFig. 1.\n\u2014\nThv vriled ti^^ure photoorapli taken at Crewe by W. Hope as\ndescribed in text.

There is no\ntl<.)ubt that the handwriting is that of the late Dr C'rawford, but it will be\nseen that the result has every appearance of having been produced by\ncutting out letters and forming them up to make sense. The top result\nilhistrates this by means of a result in the handwj'iting of the late Major\nR. E. E. iSpencer which Mr Barlow faked for him some time before his death\nfrom some of his letters to show how simply this could be done.\n\f129] Report of an Investigation into Spirit-Photography 125\nfrankly admit now that it is an equally good likeness of other\ngentlemen I have known who closely resembled him. Moreover,\nthe same \" extra \", identical in every detail has been obtained by\nother sitters with Mrs Deane, such sitters being absolute strangers\nto myself or family and, for all I know, they may think it a likeness\nof a relative or friend of theirs.\nThe \" extra \" of my father which I obtained at Crewe is easily\nexplained. When I got the result from Mrs Deane I was so pleased\nthat I mounted the normal photograph alongside the supposed\npsychic likeness and scattered these broadcast. I am pretty\nconfident that one of these went to Crewe, and in any case the\nphotograph was pubhshed in Light on 20 August 1921. It was\nafter that (on 7 October 1922) that I got the likeness of my father\nat Crewe.\nSome sitters, of course, get recognised \" extras \" every time.\nThe result satisfies them, but it would not satisfy an unprejudiced\ncritic. The likeness is probably a Httle indistinct, as most \" extras\n\"\nare, and bears a resemblance to someone they may have known at\nsome time or other. Into this vague resemblance they weave\nthe equally vague likeness that exists in their memory, and in a very\nlittle while they do honestly consider the \" extra \" to be a perfect\nlikeness. I think you will find that your memories of dead_ friends\ndo not consist so much in remembering all their facial details as in\na 'general recollection of their individual personalities. My ex-\nperience with Moss and other fraudulent mediums has satisfied\nme that no scientific value can be placed on the vast majority of\nthese claims for recognised \" extras.\" Experimental fake extras\nof imknown people have been readily recognised as friend or relative\nof people to whom I have shown them.\nNow we come to the question of the conditions under which these\nresults have been obtained. As many readers know, I have been\nmuch favoured by the mediums and have been granted tests and\nexperiments such as do not fall to the lot of the ordinary investi-\ngator. A careful reconsideration of all such tests, in view of what\nI know now, has satisfied me that I have never had one so-called test\nsitting where there was not some loop-hole for fraud.\nI will mention a personal example by way of illustrating how easy\nit is to overlook some apparently minor but very vital point in these\nphotographic experiments. On numerous occasions in the past\nI have referred to what I thought at the time was a perfect test.\nThe Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures, of which I was\nthe Hon. Secretary, presented Hope with a new camera. Accom-\npanied by two other members of the Society I took this camera\nto Crewe.\nHope allowed me to load the shdes with my own plates and\n\f126 Fred Barlow [part\nto develop them afterwards. He was not in the dark room either for\nloading or developing, and certainly did not interfere with the camera\nin any way. On one out of four plates used \" extras \" appeared\n(see pages 48-9 and 83-4 of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Case for\nSpirit Photography). There appeared to be no opportunity for\ntrickery here, but after my experience with Moss, and the informa-\ntion that had been given to me in regard to Hope, I went through\nmy various reports on sittings and in my account of this particular\nsitting, signed by myself and the two who accompanied me, I found\nthat after I had loaded the slide, and taken it with me out of the\ndark room, Hope went into an alleged trance during which he was\nsupposed to be controlled by his guide \" Massa.\" \" Massa \" gave\ninstructions that the medium should be given one of the loaded\nslides to keep in his left trouser pocket. It was the last slide used\nand one which contained the plate with the \"extras.\"\nIt is perfectly clear to me now that Hope printed the images on the\nplate whilst the slide was in his possession. What I could not under-\nstand was how I could possibly have overlooked such opportunity\nfor trickery. I certainly did not intentionally suppress this impor-\ntant point, and can only look upon it as a subconscious suppression\ncaused by the \" will to believe.\"\nWhat happens in the ordinary way when a sitter goes to Crewe ?\nHe takes with him his own unopened packet of plates. After a\nshort service, he goes into the dark room to load the slides. In\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred Hope is in the dark room either\nfor loading the slides before exposure in the camera, or unloading\nthem before developing the plates\u2014at some time or other he\nhandles the loaded slide or the plates. He once told me that he\nconsidered this necessary as the power works \" through his hands.\"\nThe dark room is a very small pantry with a high narrow shelf for\nloading and developing, and the room is lit by a very feeble red\nlight. During some part of the proceedings Hope handles the\nloaded slide and has ample opportunity to print an \" extra \" on\nthe plate without being detected. Major Rose will describe some\nof these trick methods later. I incline to the view that most of\nHope's \" extras \" are printed by him on the plate immediately\nafter loading the shdes. Invariably, during this period, he is in an\nexcited and talkative condition.\nAt one time most of Hope's results appear to have been produced\non plates prepared beforehand, and the deed was apparently done\nby substituting the plate or the loaded slide. After the sitting\nwith Mr Price, 1 who used X-ray marked plates without Hope's\nknowledge, there was a marked change in the nature of the \" extras\n''\nobtained at Crewe. Prior to that experiment the \" extra \" consisted\n1 Cp. Journ. S.P.R. (1922), xx. 271 ff.\n\f129] Report of an Investigation into Spirit-Photography 127\nof a veiled face often occupying the greater portion of the plate.\nSince Mr Price's exposure of Hope, substitution seems to have\nbecome too risky, and most of the results now show a small face\nidentical in kind with what can be produced by flash-light apparatus.\nSuch flash-light apparatus can easily be palmed and used in the\ndark-room or pocket without fear of detection. The apparatus\nmay vary in size from \\\" to 2\" in diameter and from about ^\" in\nthickness. It consists of a small electric bulb with wires w-hich are\nconnected to a battery hidden about the person. In front of this\nelectric bulb is placed a small positive face and it is only necessary\nto switch on the bulb for a second or so to print the positive on to\nthe sensitive plate where, of course, it will develop as a negative\nimage. One of the small types of flash lamps on the market can be\nused for this purpose, but a fraudulent medium could equip himself\nwith something even smaller and so more easily concealed.\nDuring the joint experiments of Major Rose and myself with\nHope, on the only occasion when we gave him the opportunity of\nsubstituting the plate, we got one of these veiled faces (see Fig. 1),\nbut on every other occasion when we got a result this was such as\ncould be produced by a \" switch,\" as the flashlight apparatus is called.\nWhere trickery was rendered absolutely impossible we got no result.\nNow let us turn our attention to psychographs. Psychograph is\nthe name applied to a written message on the photographic plate,\npossibly in the hand-writing of the deceased person from whom it\nis supposed to come. What better proof of survival could we have\nthan this, if only we could be absolutely sure about it ? Curiously\nenough I have never obtained a psychograph, although I have made\nmany attempts to get one. It may be that Hope thought it too\nrisky to attempt this with an experienced sitter. At the same\ntime, some sitters have secured messages on the plate in the hand-\nwriting of Archdeacon CoUey, Mr William Walker, Miss Scatcherd,\nDr Crawford, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, etc.\nI know of no occasion where Hope has produced a message in\nfacsimile hand-writing from any persons with whom he had not\nhad correspondence during their life time. For instance, Hope had\nmany letters from J\\Iiss Scatcherd. It is a simple matter to select\npassages from such letters, cut them out, join them up and photo-\ngraph them. Supposing one did do this, what would happen ?\nUnless it had been done with very great care we should see the\nscissor markings. It would be necessary to cover each section\ncarefully with cotton wool or similar material and, where he was\nstuck for a word or a few words to make sense, such a fraudulent\nmedimn would have to fill it in, in as close an imitation as he could\nmake of the hand-writing he was trying to copy. This seems to\nbe exactly the case with Hope's psychographs (see Fig. 2).\n\f128 Fred Barlow [part\nThese psychographs are of somewhat rare occurrence and apart\nfrom the actual hand-writing there is little enough in them of\nevidential value. A psychograph once prepared, the next step is\nto photograph it and then substitute the plate. Actually the result\ncan be obtained without substituting the plate. It is possible\nby the use of the previously prepared transparency to get a psycho-\ngraph on a plate specially marked in advance, but it is simpler to do\nthe substitution trick.\nIn all good faith, we are told time and time again that \" Hope\nnever touched the plates,\" but where an \" extra \" is obtained\nthere is always some short period of control by the medium, which\nis often entirely unnoticed, but is quite sufficient to allow of the\ntrick being done. I have already indicated how easily one may\noverlook some apparently minor but essential part of the experiment.\nIf the thing is genuine, it should be possible to get that perfect\ntest which would definitely settle the matter, but there are always\nsome \"conditions,\" and it is these \"conditions\" that render the\ntest of no value. For example, on a number of occasions Hope\nhas been asked to submit himself for examination after an \" extra\n\"\nhas been obtained, but I have never known him to agree to this on\nthe spot. On one occasion he did pretend to agree ; it was during\nan experiment with a journalist named Moseley. After securing\nan \" extra \" Moseley, who noticed a suspicious bulge in Hope's\npocket, asked Hope to let him search him. Miss Stead supported\nthis very reasonable request, but Hope very indignantly refused\nand cleared out of the room. In a short time he returned and said,\nin effect, to Moseley, \" You can search me now.\" ^\nI have had many letters from Hope, and there is scarcely a letter\nin which he does not say, \" I cannot give you any tests.\" The\nfollowing, for example, is from a letter received in July 1931 :\n\" If there is a man in the world I would do anything for it is Mr\nBarlow but I have finished test work for all so whenever you do\ncome don't bring plates and tell these good people the same for I find\nthem and do the work myself. Please take me at my word for\nI mean it.\"\nIf Hope is genuine, why should he write in that strain to one who\nwas his active supporter ? Of course, I did not take his remarks\ntoo seriously. I tried to get a test at every sitting, but Hope\nalways appeared to take very good care to make some stipulation\nwhich would render fraud possible. These conditions seemed so\nharmless at the time that I considered them of no importance, but\neventually it was brought home to me that they were apparently\nessential to the success of the experiment by providing the necessary\nopportunity for trickery.\n1 See John Bull, 18 April 1931\n.\n\fPLATE ITT\n\"Pio,. 3. \u2014Xn. the experiment with Mrs Deane indicated by these illustra-\ntions, a small stereoscopic camera was used simultaneously with an. ordi-\nnary camera.

Although autographed\nmessages all show \" scissors and paste \" effects, those psychographs\nin copper-plate writing show no such effects. I have very carefully\nexamined most of the results in copper-plate script obtained by\nI\nHope and in every case they bear a marked resemblance to Hope's\nordinary handwriting\u2014far more carefully done, and, of course,\ndisguised, but I do not hesitate to assert that the two writings are\nidentical.\nApart from any other evidence, these psychographs in themselves\nprovide internal evidence which would be sufficient to obtain a\nverdict against him in a court of law. The language is Hope's and\nthey contain mistakes in spelling and grammar such as he is in the\nhabit of making.\nFor example, I have a psychograph in which the word \" present\n\"\nis spelt \" presant.\" Both before and after the production of this\npsychograph I have letters from Hope in which the word \" present\n\"\nis mis-spelt in the same manner. In another of Hope's psycho-\ngraphs the word \" beginning \" is spelt with two g's and the prefix\n\" physio \" is wrongly used instead of the prefix \" psycho.\" I have\nseveral letters of Hope's in which \" psychograph \" is spelt \" physio-\ngraph.\" His photographic messages and his ordinary letters\ncontain the same type of spelling and grammatical errors. Another\npsychograph I have commences, \" We are sorry, very sorry ...\"\nI have also a letter from Hope in which the same phrase occurs,\n\" I am sorry, very sorry ...\" Evidence such as this points very\nstrongly to the fact that these psychographs emanated from the\nsame person that wrote the letters.\nI shall probably be asked, \" What about the messages Hope gets\non the plate in foreign languages ?\n\" My reply to such a question\nis that such messages are very few and far between and are invari-\nably in text-book phraseology such as anyone could produce.\nMoreover, the same message occasionally does service for more than\none psychograph. In a very ordinary message in three languages\nin one of Hope's early productions there is a sentence in French\nwhich reads, \" Je desire que vous usiez votre influence et la leur\ndans cette affaire.\" The same sentence, word for word, forms the\nsubstance of a psychograph obtained by Dr Haraldur Nielsson at\nCrewe some years later (12 August 1921), a copy of which Dr Nielsson\nsent to me.\nThere are so many aspects of this subject that to cover the\nground properly would take many pages, and in deciding what not\nto include one is liable to become scrappy. But I propose now to\nmention a number of items which are of importance, although more\nor less disconnected, and to illustrate some of these items with\nactual specimens.\n\f130 Fred Barlow [part\nWhen using two or more cameras simultaneously I have never\nobtained an \" extra \" on more than one plate (see Fig. 3). I have\nexperimented with thousands of plates but have never secured an\n\" extra \" unless the plate or the dark slide containing the plate has\nbeen handled by a photographic medium.\nMany \" extras \" have been taken from newspapers or magazines.\nThey are exact copies of printed publications and show stipple\nmarkings and scissor cuts (see Fig. 4). The same \" extra \" is\noccasionally used for different sitters and, what is more important\nstill, the drapery is at times dupUcated thread for thread with\ndifferent faces stuck in the centre.\nWhite cotton wool and drapery effects are often described as\nectoplasm. As there is no question of an objective materialisation\nI do not see why in any circumstances this should be ectoplasm.\nIt appears obvious that the cotton wool and drapery effects are\nsimply used to disguise the cut-out edges of the \" extra.\" In fact,\na draped or cotton wool \" extra \" is to me an indication of trickery.\nMany spirit photographs show background markings. For\nexample, the \" extra \" is set up and photographed separately so\nthat when the same plate is used with a sitter, backgroimd markings\nshow through. Accidents sometimes happen in the production of\nthese spirit images, and several of the negatives I obtained during\none experiment show a very ordinary enamel washing-up bowl on\nthe corner of a kitchen table beneath some very attractive \" extras.\"\nThis bowl was in full view when the first, fake, exposure was made,\nwithout the medium noticing it.\nLots of negatives obtained by Hope, before the Price experiment,\nclearly showed double exposure markings down the edges of the\nplate, and on some of these the film has been scraped away from\nthe glass to remove this evidence of double exposure. What is\nmeant by double exposure is that a plate is inserted in the slide and\na face is then photographed on it. The same plate, with the face\non it, is again inserted in the dark slide when it is used for photo-\ngraphing a sitter. Dark slides are made large enough to take the\nplates easily, with the result that no plate occupies identically the\nsame position in the slide on each occasion. The plates are sheltered\nat the edges, by the shde rebates, from the light entering the camera,\nso that there is upon development a distinct hne down the margins\nof the plate showing the unexposed portions. When the plate\nhas been inserted twice in the dark slide these tell-tale markings are\ndoubled and, of course, they are proof positive of double exposure.\nThe claim has been made that the Crewe Circle are not pro-\nfessional mediums because they do not charge a fee. Although they\n\u2022do not specify a particular fee, they have always accepted fees from\nmyself and all other sitters I have known. They were, of course.\n\f129] Report of an Investigation into Spirit-Photography 131\nentitled to fees if genuine, but the sitter is also entitled to reasonable\nassurance that what he is getting is genuine.\nPeople say that if Hope is a fraud he must be remarkably clever,\nbut no great skill is required. A fake mediimi gets plenty of\npractice, and imlike a conjuror he has not got to bring off the trick\nat a given moment every time. The only risk he runs is that he\nmight be seized and searched, but I have never heard of this being\ndone.\nIn the Mariott-Douglas case, Mr Mariott, the magician, produced\nfake effects with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Mr James Douglas,\nwithout being discovered, under conditions far more stringent than\nthose obtaining wnth Hope at a test on a previous occasion.^\nI have made very little reference to Mrs Deane in these experi-\nments. Through the courtesy of Miss Estelle Stead, Major Rose and\nmyself were able to have a number of sittings with Mrs Deane at\nthe Stead Bureau. Major Rose will refer to these results, but in\nfairness to Mrs Deane I wish to make reference to a result I obtained\non the last occasion but one on which I sat with her. Unfortunately,\non this occasion Major Rose had made a mistake in the date so I\ntook the sitting alone with Mrs Deane. I was the first sitter on\nthat day and, using a box of plates provided by Miss Stead, I secured\na very clear \" extra.\" I very carefully followed all the proceedings\nwithout detecting anything in the least degree suspicious on the\npart of Mrs Deane. After developing the plate I said to Mrs Deane\nquite frankly, \" Look here, I have got an excellent result. Now I\nwant to examine the whole of the place thoroughly.\" She raised\nno objection whatever, and I went through the whole of the small\nstudio, top to bottom, through all the drawers and Mrs Deane's\nbag, and I searched Mrs Deane herself as well as I could. I could\nnot discover the least trace of anything suspicious. At the end of\nthe search Miss Stead happened to come into the studio. I told her\nwhat I had done.\nThe only loophole so far as I could see was that I had not used\nmy own plates. I have not the least shadow of doubt as to the\nintegrity of Miss Stead, but it may be argued that Mrs Deane had\naccess to the plates and could have faked a result beforehand. It\nis perhaps unnecessary to add that I did not recognise the \" extra\n\"\nobtained. I very much regret to state also that this particular\nnegative shows the double exposure markings to which I have\nalready referred, so that the inference is obvious.\nI should like to refer very briefly to some experiments conducted\nwith Hope by Dr Higson, an expert chemist, on behalf of the British\nPhotographic Research Association. The first report of the\nAssociation, dated 1 September 1920, signed by Dr Higson, suggested\n1 See Journ. S.P.R. (1920), xx. 219 g., 259 fi.\n\f132 Fred Barlow [PAET\nthat in at least one result the shutter of the dark slide had been\npartly withdrawn and the \" extra \" printed on this by normal means\nimmediately after the slide had been loaded. The Association\ngave it as their considered opinion that all these alleged supernormal\nresults were produced by a small flashlight apparatus, and their\nreport goes on to say, \" We have proved to our satisfaction that\nphenomena, exactly similar to those produced by Mr Hope can be\nproduced on plates by purely normal means . . . without any great\nfear of detection.\"\nFurther experiments were made in which it was noted that Hope\nput the dark slide into his left pocket immediately after it had been\nloaded and kept his hand there. ^ This loaded slide was actually in\nHope's possession for about a couple of minutes when Dr Higson\nsucceeded in substituting another loaded slide in place of it, without\nHope being any the wiser. The report proves that the loaded slide\nwhich had been in Hope's possession for only two minutes and\nwhich had never been inserted in a camera, contained a plate on\nwhich an \" extra \" had been printed by Hope by means of this\nflashlight apparatus. Naturally, Hope, who did not know of the\nsubstitution of the plate, expressed great surprise when no \" extra\n\"\nappeared on the plate on development. In the full report by Dr\nHigson and in subsequent correspondence from Dr T. Slater Price,\nthe Director of Research, it is stated quite conclusively that they\nhave no doubt whatever that Hope did fake the results by means\nof some simple form of flashlight apparatus.^\nMy experience has been such that no photographic effect would\ncarry any weight with me again unless I could be absolutely sure\nthat fraud was entirely ruled out of court. To get this confidence\nI am afraid I should have to be present at the experiment, because\nI have been told so often in the past that fraud was impossible,\nwhen a little cross-examination had proved that there was ample\nopportunity for trickery.\nAt the same time one could devise fraud-proof conditions even\nto the extent of allowing the medium to handle the plate, but it\nseems impossible to get a present-day medium to submit to such\nconditions.\nI want to make it quite clear that I am not claiming that no\nphotographic medium has ever produced a genuine \" extra.\"\nWhat I do feel, however, is that the information Major Rose and\nmyself are placing before you in this paper indicates a very unsatis-\nfactory state of affairs in regard to this question of spirit photo-\ngraphy. To carry conviction the evidence for what are claimed to\n^ See also p. 126 above.\n^ This report has not been published, but a copy of it, with correspondence\nrelating to it, has been deposited at the Rooms of the Society.\n\fPLATE V\nFig. 5. \u2014Typical photooraplis of the Hash-lamp method taken at Ch'ewe by W.

There is the Price experiment which most definitely proved\nplate substitution.\n2. There is the evidence of my friend, a well-known investigator,\nconcerning the very suspicious circumstances he observed at sittings\nwith Hope.\n3. There is my considered statement to the effect that every\ndefinitely recognised \" extra \" I have seen of Hope's is a copy of a\nnormal photograph, or such as could have been prepared from an\nordinary photograph.\n4. There is the definite evidence of double exposure on Hope's\nnegatives.\n5. There is the evidence showing that Hope's psychographs or\nphotographic messages, in themselves, provide internal evidence of a\nvery suspicious character.\n6. There is the evidence of the British Photographic Research\nAssociation and their definite conclusion that Hope produces his\neffects by trickery.\n7. There is the fact that in every so-called test sitting I have\nconducted, or have heard of, I know of no instance where Hope\nhas got an \" extra \" which could not be produced in identical\ncircumstances by normal means.\n8. There is the evidence of our own common-sense which rejects\nthese cut-out faces, block markings, magazine illustrations, cotton\nwool and muslin effects, and which tells us that these things are just\nas suspicious as they look.\nPostscript.\nBefore the publication of this paper, Hope, in anticipation of\nthese criticisms, in a weekly Spiritualist paper attempted to give\nsome account of our sittings, and of his (Hope's) subsequent visit\nto Major Rose at Chester. This account consists of a series of mis-\nstatements, so even if we had any doubts whatever about his\ngenuineness they would have been removed, since naturally a\nperson who does not adhere to the truth would not be above cheating\nwhen the opportunity occurs.\nII. By Major W. Rampling-Rose.\nI should like first of all to pay a tribute to Mr Barlow for his moral\ncourage in writing what he has written above.\n\f134 Major W. Eamplmg-Bose [part\nMy contribution will be largely technical. The pictures repro-\nduced are those which were taken of Mr Barlow and myself\u2014and\non two occasions a third person was included in the picture.\nI will deal with those taken at Crewe with Hope first. The plates\nand films which were used I brought from Chester myself, except\non one occasion which I shall describe presently. The method of\nprocedure was this : We met Hope at Mrs Buxton's house in\nMarket Street, and we held a rehgious service (the four of us) in the\nfront room, hands on table, plates, etc., in the middle. Then I\ncarried the material into the dark-room (a cupboard or hidey hole\nunder the stairs in the next room). Hope went in first, self next,\nthen Mr Barlow. Mrs Buxton never came in\u2014the reason being\nmainly physical, because when the three of us had crowded in, there\nwas no room for anyone else, especially a stout person like Mrs\nBuxton. I undid the plates. Hope produced a wooden double\ndark slide\u2014two plates were loaded into this, I initialled them, and\nout we all went into a sort of lean-to wash-house. The camera\nused was an old-fashioned Lancaster's Instantograph about forty\nyears old\u2014no cap or shutter on lens\u2014exposure was made by the\nsimple process of pulling up the shutter of the dark slide and\npushing it down again when Hope thought the plate had received\nsufficient exposure. Meanwhile, Hope and Mrs Buxton held hands\nover the camera.\nWhen the two plates were taken, we went back into the dark-\nroom\u2014Hope leading the way. I unloaded the dark slide, reloaded\nit with fresh plates, the exposures were made, and in all we generally\ntook six (I carried the exposed plates in my pocket). These were\nthen developed in the dark-room\u2014three half-plate dishes were used\nand about three ounces of pyro soda developer was poured from\ndish to dish until the image was developed.\nOn three of the plates an \" extra \" would appear. The other\nthree had only the photographs of ourselves. The \" extra\n\"\nusually appeared on every second plate exposed. These \" extras\n\"\ncompletely puzzled me on at least two occasions, and I really\nthought there was something supernormal after all. Mr Barlow\nwanted me to be unbiased in my opinion, and he himself appeared\ninclined to beUeve that the phenomena were genuine and super-\nnormal. The religious atmosphere and the earnestness of the\nwhole thing were most disarming. During the service, Hope\nalways said an extempore prayer and used such words as \" Vouch-\nsafe, 0 Lord, a manifestation of thy Divine presence,\" etc., etc.,\nso I can well understand how the casual visitor would be deceived.\nOn reading over my notes which I made directly I got home, I find\nthat I said, \" The plates and shdes were under observation all the\ntime and yet extras appeared.\" Well, I was mistaken. I missed\n\f129] Report of an Investigation into Spirit-Photography 135\nout an obvious interval of a second or two, which was sufficient\ntime for Hope to put the \" extras \" on the plate in a natural way.\nThere are many ways of doing the same thing, and it is all a matter\nof simple conjuring of the sleight-of-hand variety.\n[At this point Major Rose, when reading this paper to the Society,\ntook an ordinary wooden double dark-slide, loaded with plates,\nand from under the lapel of his coat he took a small flashlamp,\non the top of which was the positive image of a face. He showed\nhow simple is was to open with the fingers the easy fitting shutter\nof the dark slide about an inch or so, and to place the flashlight in\ncontact with the plate. Then he switched on the light momentarily\nand thus impressed an \" extra \" on the sensitive emulsion.]\nIt is the most natural thing in the world for the photographer,\nwhen he has exposed two plates, to invite the sitters to come with\nhim into the dark-room and develop the plates or change them as\nthe case may be, and it is then that the photographer (whilst leading\nthe way into the dark-room and with his back to those who are\nfollowing him) has such a good chance to put the \" extra on the\nplate as shown (see Figs. 5, 6).\nAnother way of doing the same thing with a flashlamp was\nunder the focussing cloth when the dark slide was in position in\nthe camera. Mr Barlow has such photographs, which show a slight\nfog patch where the daylight has got under the cloth and affected\nthe plate while the \" extra \" was being exposed. The photograph\nplainly show^s how far the shutter was withdrawn. There is less\nrisk of fogging the plate, however, if the photographer uses the flash-\nlamp when just entering the dark-room, taking care to keep the\nslide close to the body and expose the bottom plate.\nYet another way is to work the same trick with a dark-slide in\nthe pocket, or when the plates are being marked by the sitter in\nthe dark-room after they have been inserted in the dark-slide. I\nsuggest that along these lines is the explanation how these \" extras\n\"\nwere put on the plate.\nThere is, however, another method occasionally employed by\nHope\u2014namely plate substitution. This happened in only one\ncase out of the dozen or more joint sittings we had at Crewe. Under\nthe usual method of procedure, there was little or no chance for Hope\nto substitute a prepared plate for one of mine. One day, however,\nwhen we were holding the usual service, Mr Barlow said, \" Billy,\nwhy not use one of your own plates and see if we can get a veiled\nfigure.'' After some further persuasion, Hope left the room, and\nin due course, returned with a double dark-slide loaded with two\nplates.\nReferring to my notes on this occasion, I find the following,\n\" The reason why B. pressed Hope to use his own plates was (as\n\f136 Major W. Rampling-Bose [part\nlie told me afterwards) that in sucli cases a draped figure generally\nappeared. Evidently, therefore, these prepared plates are kept\nready for visitors.\" Well, sure enough a draped figure did appear\non one of the plates (see Fig. 1).\nI want to draw attention to these points : The face is cut out\nfrom some printed matter\u2014the fine dots of the screen can be\nplainly seen. The pattern of the drapery is visible too, and the\ngrain indicates either cheese cloth or butter muslin. If anyone still\nthinks that this is supernormal, I call their special attention to the\nmargin, where will be seen undoubted evidence of double exposure.\nHope did not want me to take this plate away with me. All\nprevious results I had taken away with me without his raising his\nobjection, but not this time. However, I promised to return it in\ntwo days, together with an enlargement and a lantern slide. This\nI did. I also took several contact prints from it for my own satis-\nfaction and study. The one partly shown here is very lightly\nprinted, so as to show the double rebate as can plainly be seen.\nSome fortnight afterwards, Hope wrote to Mr Barlow and said\nthat he had not received the photographs as promised. I said that\nI had certainly sent them, but as I had not put my name and\naddress on them, I could do nothing.\nSome time after this, a lady from Chester went to Crewe. Hope\nshowed her this photograph, saying it was my mother, and that\nI was a doctor (as a matter of fact I studied medicine when young).\nThe lady told Hope who I really was, and this knowledge, coupled\nwith the fact of some correspondence with Mr Barlow, brought\nHope to Chester. He turned up at my works this summer (1932),\nand at our interview he mentioned this photograph and said to\nme, \" You know very well it's a spirit photograph of your dear\nMother.\" I laughed, and told him that my Mother was alive.\nShe is, by the way, as vigorous as a woman of 40, and although\nover 80, her sight and hearing are as good as ever. She is, perhaps,\nmore outspoken than she used to be. I showed her this result\nand told her about it, and how it was supposed to be a spirit photo-\ngraph of herself. She said a few words, forcible and to the point.\nI smile now whenever I think of them.\nNote, however, that Hope did receive the photographs I sent to\nhim : otherwise he could not have shown them to the lady. I told\nHope when he was in my office that I had enough evidence (if it was\na murder case) to convict him. Amongst other things said by\nhim was this, \" If you will say the word, I will never take another\nphotograph again.\" My reply was that his future actions had\nnothing whatever to do with me, and I did not want to control\nthem.\nHe offered to come over and give me a sitting in my works, but\n\fPLATE VII\nFig. 8.\u2014An enlargement of the extra seen in Fig. 7. Xote the\ncharacteristic cotton -vvool effect.\n\fPLATE VIII\n\fI29j Report of an Investigation into Spirit-Photography 137\nI refused unless Mr Barlow was present. In any case, it was quite\nevident that all the results we obtained at Crewe were fraudulent,\nso it was really not worth while wasting further time.\nIn addition to these experiments with Hope, I also tried to get\nresults on roll films, filmpacks, and plates that were left in the box,\nand which had not been put into Hope's slides. I took all this\nexposed and unexposed sensitive material back to my works, and\nhad them developed there\u2014not specially\u2014but in the ordinary\nway, and in no case was there anything abnormal.\nMore than that, Mr Warrick, who believes both in Hope and Mrs\nDeane, took the trouble to send over one of his travellers (also a\nbeliever) to Crewe with a special fitment for Hope's camera contain-\ning a half-dozen plates. These Hope exposed in the ordinary\ncourse, and the traveller arrived in Chester with the undeveloped\nresults. He was very earnest and emphatic in his assertions that\nHope had had no access to the plates, and that they had never been\nin Hope's darkroom. Again nothing abnormal appeared.\nSo much for Hope, and now for Mrs Deane. The same religious\natmosphere, except that the prayer was the Lord's Prayer, and not\nan extempore one. We sang a hymn chosen from a book. We\npaid several visits, and together only obtained two results in which\na face appeared. Markings in other cases frequently happened.\nI believe these to be of a chemical origin, and anyone could obtain\nsimilar markings by purposely rubbing the emulsion with a finger\non which was an alkali of sorts. There is a distinct evidence of\nfluid marks. We can dismiss these and come to the faces (see\nFigs. 7-8).\nHere we have undoubted and certain proof of the substitution of\na previously prepared plate. I have printed both these plates on\none piece of paper, giving the same exposure and, of course, both\nsides developed, etc., together. I desire to make the following\npoints :\n1. The two plates were supposed to be the same make (Wellington\nAnti-Screen).\n2. They both received the same exposure (31 sees.) and the light\nconditions were identical.\n3. Both plates were marked with a pin point drawn across the\ncorner\u2014but only one scratch shows.\nMrs Deane asked somewhat anxiously whilst I was unwrapping\nthe plates in her dark-room, \" These plates are not marked, are\nthey ?\n\" I said, \" No,\" and that was true at the time, but as I\nhanded them to her one by one I scratched across the corner of\neach with a pin.\n4. They were developed together in the same dish for the same\nlength of time.\n\f138 Major W. Rampling-Rose [part 129\n5. They were fixed together.\n6. The resulting negatives are very different, as can be seen,\nbecause obviously the background of the \" extra \" one has received\nmore exposure than the other.\n7. Hence the faces are \" flatter.\"\n8. The marginal rebate of the \" extra \" plate plainly indicates\ntwo exposures.\n9. The speed of the plate is different, as also is the density curve.\n10. It is fogged at the top. This happened in many of Mrs\nDeane's negatives that I have seen on which \" extras \" appeared.\nThere is a very simple explanation for this which I will not go into.\nFig. 8 is an enlargement of the \" extra \" on Fig. 7, and I want\nto draw your attention to the cotton-wool effect. Many of Mrs\nDeane's effects that I have seen are like this.\nIn Fig. 9, which was taken when Mr Barlow was by himself, as\nhe has already explained, you will notice the following points :\ncotton wool, fogged top, and double rebate, and there is the same\nevidence here as in the preceding one of the use of a previously\nprepared plate.\nIn conclusion, I should like to add a personal note : For more\nthan thirty years I have been engaged in the photographic trade,\nand during this time my work has been to track down defects (a sort\nof detective, really), and to invent or devise methods to overcome\nthem.\nI am always in touch with experts on matters photographic, and\nmy yearly output in business runs into milUons of photographs.\nI have taken photographs in almost every part of the world, and\nduring the war I had four years' aerial photographic experience.\nI mention these facts to emphasise and underline the following\nstatement\n:\nI do not remember ever seeing a single abnormal photograph of\nall those which have passed through my hands that could not be\nexplained by purely natural means. If anyone doubts the fraudu-\nlent nature of all the results and can find a reasonable supernormal\nexplanation, I shall be glad to hear it.\nIt will not be profitable to discuss results that others have ob-\ntained, and in any case, it is only by making a series of experiments\nthat a satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at. Photography is\nstill a very mysterious thing to the large majority of people and\nthe ways of faking results are endless, even in the hands of those\nwho have only an elementary knowledge of it.\n\fA CONSIDERATION OF A SERIES OF PROXY\nSITTINGS.!\nBy the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas.\nReaders of Miss Nea Walker's book, The Bridge, will be familiar\nwitli proxy sittings. They take us one step further in the study of\ntrance phenomena. During recent years I have sat with Mrs Osborne\nLeonard on many occasions when her Controk Feda, has given infor-\nmation of an evidential kind for persons who were not present and\nwho were unknown to the medium. Some of these I knew, some\nI had met but once, of others I knew no more than was to be gathered\nfrom their letter of appeal for help. These applicants for a message\nfrom deceased friends represented many types of mind, varying\ndegrees of education, and diverse social positions. Those they de-\nsired to hear from ranged from little children to aged people. In\nperusing my records I find failures, several striking successes, and\nindeed a rather bewildering variety of results. This is interesting\non any hypothesis of what actually took place ; for the conditions\nwere, so far as can be judged, identical for medium, Control and\nsitter. I was not personally interested beyond a desire to help\npeople who were in sorrow, and to discover indications of what was\nhappening behind the scenes.\nIt may have been an advantage that I am a convinced Spiritualist\n;\nfor it enabled me to act my part with sincerity both during the\nsitting and when preparing for it at home. Yet I remained all the\ntime, as I hope and believe, a cool-headed psychical researcher,\nalways alert for possibilities of information leaking into the experi-\nment by normal channels and anxious to judge with precision the\nvalue of each message.\nIt will naturally be suggested that no persons were likely to make\nthis kind of appeal unless they were inclined to believe in the possi-\nbility of communication from the other world, and that, therefore,\nthey would be predisposed to accept the result with a somewhat\nindiscriminating readiness, if not with so great a will-to-believe as\nwould render their supposed verifications valueless.\nTo guard against this I have made a point of ascertaining from\nthe applicants why they considered such and such items to be\nevidential. They have supplied me with the requisite information,\nso that the statement made during the sitting can be paired with\nthe relevant facts. With records thus completed I have obtained\nthe kind assistance of Mrs W. H. Salter and of Mr H. F. Saltmarsh\n1 Read at a Private Meeting of the Society, 30 September 1931.\nH 139\n\f140 The Rev.

I am\nindebted to the above for their kindness in valuing the whole series,\nand to other of our members for studying a lesser number and giving\ntheir opinion as to evidential values.\nThe examiners were in fairly close agreement and classify the\ncases thus :\nGood prima facie evidence of identity - - - - 4\nFair prima facie evidence of identity - - - - 4\nPoor to fair prima facie evidence of identity - - 7\nInconclusive or failures ------ 9\nIn this arrangement no case has been given the benefit of a doubt.\nWhere, for example, a case has been classed as \" good \" by two\nexaminers and \" fair \" by the third, it has been placed among the\n\" fair,\" on the principle that it is preferable to under-estimate and\nthereby make the argument based upon these cases more sure.\nThe above values indicate that, in these proxy sittings, we have\nmaterial worth discussing. Since several attempts failed completely\nwe find the two extremes of success and failure, and there are inter-\nmediate cases making a gradation of results passing from failure at\none end to success at the other.\nThe chart on pp. 140, 141 shows at a glance the relative conditions\nto which allusion will be made in discussing the significance of\ntwenty-four proxy sittings. As will be shown later, the variation\nin conditions led to no conclusion : this in itself is a point of some\nimportance.\nSome idea of the types of evidence given may be obtained from\nthe following examples. Commencing with the 4th, the poorest, we\ntake others from the 3rd and 2nd, and finally from the 1st class.\nCase \" Wr ^\"^'^\nAfter receiving notes of this sitting, the applicant sent for my\ninspection the photograph of an oil painting, representing his father,\nan elderly German aristocrat, attired in a costume which would\nstrike English eyes as peculiar. This was especially so of the head-\ngear. I do not recollect having seen anything quite like it.\nThe accompanying letter said :\n\" The original portrait hangs in\na room in my sister's house. The picture is a painting representing\nmy father, the peculiar cap is a Spanish boina. Nearly all the things\nin that room are connected with my late wife : she occupied the\nroom for some months in 1928.\"\nI now quote the paragraph in the proxy sitting to which the\nabove would seem to refer :\nFeda. There is a room with a picture of a man with a peculiar\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 143\ncap. The man in the picture is elderly and seems to be in an alto-\ngether unusual costume which is expressed particularly by the head-\ngear. In this room are several things connected with the lady who\nhas passed over.\nItems correct\n:\n1. In room containing articles connected with the applicant's wife,\n2. is picture of elderly man,\n3. in unusual costume,\n4. and a peculiar cap.\nCase \" r.\"\nI was subsequently informed that this schoolboy had, five months\nbefore his death, spent a holiday in Switzerland with his head master.\nThis holiday was spoilt by an accident in which the boy sprained his\nankle and was obliged to spend several days in the chalet instead\nof making excursions with his companions.\nThe father had insured his son's life. On the boy's death this\nmoney was devoted to his memorial in their church. The Christmas\nafter his death all the family were together in the old home with\nthe exception of a married daughter and her husband. As the date\nof this sitting was Christmas Eve, the family gathering must have\nalready assembled.\nFeda. He was a boy full of life, but he had something a few months\nbefore he passed over which annoyed him, because it happened at\na time when he wanted very much to do something, and that im-\npressed it on his mind. I don't get much link between that and\nhis passing ; I get the feeling of a place he was fond of. It is all\nup and down, you could not walk very far along the roads without\nhaving to go up hill or down. He was there. It was not his home,\nhe was doing something there, I get a name \" S \" connected with\nthe place, it is not a short name, he tries to give me an impression\nof it as if there were a lot of letters in it.\nThere was a sheet of paper with printing on it which seemed to\nrefer to money, or money's worth, I felt you could hand this paper\nover and get some money for it, it is a numbered paper. It is some-\nthing he had here in his earth life and did not use, anyhow, it be-\nlonged to him, it was for him and he had not intended using it for\nsome time. His people felt they would like to use it for some special\npurpose.\nHe says, I shall be with those who are going to be together at\nChristmas, but they will be thinking about two other people who\ncannot be with them.\nItems correct\n:\n1. Annoying accident a few months before his death.\n2. He was in \" S \" (longish place-name) uphill and down.\n\f144 The Bev. C. Drayton Tliomm [part\n3. There was a nixmbered paper referring to him for which money\ncould be obtained.\n4. His people wished to iise this money for a special purpose.\n5. Two absentees from the family Christmas gathering.\nClass III.\nCase \" J.\"\nThis communicator was one of four children who, when quite\nsmall, had each received from an aunt in Australia an Australian\nsixpemiy piece. When the communicator emigrated to Australia,\nhis sixpence was added to his father's coin collection and forgotten.\nWhile at school the Communicator had among his treasured pos-\nsessions a puzzle money box. At the time of my sitting this was\nin England, in a case, still unpacked since a recent change of family\nresidence. Some weeks after the sitting I was shown this box. I\nfailed to open it, and then noticed the relevancy of the phrase used\nby Feda, \" pushing it to see if it would come open \" ; for in the\nprocess of opening this box it is necessary to push one part against\nanother part. It was not, as Feda thought, made of metal, but of\nhard dark wood.\nFeda. \" Sixpence . . . sixpence \" (the word was twice whispered\nsoftly). Such a silly little thing, he feels he has to apologise for\nnaming it, but he thinks they found a sixpence belonging to him\nin an unexpected place. They knew it was his sixpence. He thinks\nthey will remember about it because it was rather out of the ordinary.\nTell them they found a funny little box but did not know how to\nopen it, it puzzled them. He is amused about it, it is a most awfully\ndifficult thing to open\u2014knocking it and pushing it to see if it would\ncome open. It is something he had a good while before he passed\nover, not a new thing.\nAs the parents did not trace the reference to a sixpence, I re-\nported at my next sitting that this point was a failure. My father\nreplied that the Communicator had been very definite about it, and\ntherefore suggested that the parents would probably remember later,\nas the boy seemed so certain. This expression of confidence is in-\nteresting in view of the fact that although the parents assured me\nthat they had no knowledge of any special sixpence, yet some weeks\nlater I received a letter from them saying that it was found, and\nwhen I called on them they told me the above facts.\nIlenis correct :\n1. Parents have a special sixpence which belonged to Communi-\ncator.\n2. And a puzzle Ijox he possessed long ago,\n3. which must be \" pushed \" to open.\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 145\nCase \" g.\"\nFeda. There may have been something the matter with her head\nor mind. Your father has seen her and she kept expressing regret,\nhe must even term it sorrow and regret. He would say quite defi-\nnitely that her mind was in a very peculiar condition. She says\nshe was aware of that herself without realising the danger. He keeps\nrepeating, \" Not accountable for actions. I will say that quite defi-\nnitely.\" She kept saying to him, \" What would her husband think ?\n\"\nShe spoke of Enid. The lady has relatives known to her husband\nwho lived abroad.\nI was later informed by the husband that for some time, before\npassing, the Communicator had a troublesome chronic condition of\nthe arteries ; also a degree of mental failure which led to erratic\nbehaviour. Also that a niece to whom she was much attached was\nnamed Enid : and that a stepsister and family reside in India.\nItems correct :\n1. Mental failure for some time before passing.\n2. Enid.\n3. Relatives living abroad.\nClass II.\nCase \" i\/.\"\nThis Communicator's father, a vicar, resided two miles from a\nnorthern town, C . For some years there had been talk about\na proposed enlarging of the vicarage ;\nthe final decision to enlarge\nwas reached twelve months before the Communicator's death,\nalthough commencement was postponed on account of illness.\nFeda. He gives Feda the feeling that a house or place he knew\nvery well, and of which he would be thinking when on earth, was\nnot quite in the town but on the outskirts. It was near the town.\nHe builds a letter \" C \" for near where he lived.\nA little before he passed his people had been talking about building\nor erecting something in which they all were interested.\nThe Communicator was killed while returning to his university\nby motor cycle. It had been originally planned that he should\nreturn on the Saturday afternoon, but at the last moment he re-\nceived an invitation to a tennis party on that day, and after some\ndoubt and discussion it was decided that his departure should be\npostponed until the Simday morning. This postponement has been\na matter of regret ever since ;\nfor, had the journey been taken on\nSaturday, as originally planned, the collision which killed him would\nnot have occurred.\nFeda. He wishes to tell his parents that he had made an alteration\nin the time of going and that that caused him to be just at the spot\nwhere the accident happened.\n\f146 The Rev. C.

He wants to say that he was entrusted, that he was rather\npleased with himself because he was entrusted with locking some-\nthing up, entrusted with keys in a rather peculiar way. It is some-\nthing he was rather proud of and was taught and allowed to do.\n\" We always trusted him to lock up the flat and to meet us for\na jaunt in town, and he always '\nheld the fort ' when we could not\ntake him with us. Locking up carefully and seeing to everything.\nHe was very proud of that.\"\nItems correct\n:\n1. He played with a round metal disc with hole in it.\n2. His mother handled this after his death.\n3. He was trusted with keys and locking up.\n4. He was proud of that.\nClass I. \u2022\nCa.se \" C.\"\nThroughout this case, which spread over several sittings, my sister\nEtta gave the messages for and about a young boy, presumably too\nyoimg to communicate direct. It emerged, in the course of the\nsittings, that he had always looked forward to the arrival of a weekly\npaper. It was the comic section of this paper which interested him.\nFor test purposes, at my request, the parents put away copies of\nthis paper and I eventually learned that they were placed in a linen\nbox under the china cabinet where plates were kept.\nFeda. About Willie's home . . . they have a paper there, one that\nthey get weekly ... a large \" C \" on the top of this paper. ... It\nhas pictures which Willie used to like looking at. Etta wants to\nsuggest that copies should be kept so that she and WiUie may try\nto get little tests from them. Willie, who is playing about while\nshe speaks, remarks that the papers will be \" put in a place where\nplates are.\"\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 147\nWillie had lived in Regina, Canada, and went to a school called\n\" Strathcona.\" Around the school swings there were railings which\nWillie often climbed against orders.\nFeda. He seems to like some particular place where there was a\nkind of railing which he used to climb over ; he ought not to have\ndone this, but she understands that he certainly did and very often.\nA place quite close to where he lived, rather a long name S ,\nwas one that he would know well and be fond of. It may have been\na house or an estate, some place of that sort.\nI learned later that Willie's mother often made backstone cakes,\nflat pieces of paste. Willie was particularly fond of these ;\nhis\nmother made them regularly for years.\nFeda. \" No hot cakes here,\" he says, but he does not want them.\nEtta understands there were some cakes which were eaten hot at\nhis home. Do they make their own bread ? because Willie described\nhow on a certain day there was a good deal of baking going on.\nHe was interested not in the loaves of bread but in the small flat\npieces of paste, looking like bread mixture and arranged on flat\nsheets of tin . . . apparently it is something they do regularly.\nEarly in November 1922, Willie's father, accompanied by a friend,\ncalled at the Stock Yards to see some horses ; while there the con-\nversation turned on the cutting of ice, which is done on a large scale\nin that part of Canada, thousands of tons being cut and stored for\nthe summer. The boy's father is an engineer.\nFeda. Tell his father that Willie accompanied him on a journey,\nquite lately ; a name \" S \" to do with the place, rather a long name.\nWhile there Willie went to look at some animals and was very\ninterested in horses.\nHis father was talking about cutting operations, as if he were\ngoing to do cutting and trimming on a rather large scale.\nA comparison of dates shows that this visit and conversation was\nbut a few days before the particular sitting at which it was men-\ntioned.\nMy sister Etta sometimes alluded to deceased relatives of Willie's\nmother, of whom apparently she had heard in the Beyond, or\npossibly met there. Among these she mentioned one, William, a\nconnection of Emma's (Willie's mother), and I later learned that\nEmma's cousin, this William Jones, had passed over about four\nyears previously. He was a sea-faring man, a marine engineer, fre-\nquently sailing from Cardiff and Barry. His ships used to go to\nnorthern Russia for grain. His wife was Isobel. His passing was\nsudden.\nFeda. There is a William closely connected with Emma, con-\nnected not with Canada and not near London, but away in the\nprovinces. Ships . . . ships . . . someone closely connected with\n\f148 The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\nEmma who all his life was connected with ships. He passed over\nsuddenly. He had when here connections with the north. One\nclosely connected with him was called Isobel.\nCorrect items :\n1. Weekly paper C , with pictures interesting to the child.\n2. Kept where plates are.\n3. He climbed railings, against orders, at a place\n4. S (long name) he was fond of.\n5. Had small, flat, hot cakes on certain days.\n6.

William, a relative of the boy's mother passed suddenly, and\n9. was connected with ships and with the north,\n10. and with Isobel.\nThis case included some fifty correct evidential items.\nCase Dr\nAmong the evidential items given by this girl, who had died as\nthe result of a motor accident, I select the following. It refers to\nthe motor accident which was caused by swerving in order to avoid\nchildren who suddenly ran into the road from a cottage. She and\nher sister had been away for the night. Their intention of returning\nhome on the Sunday was revised and they lunched with friends in\nanother direction on Monday ;\nthus their originally planned route\nhomeward was changed. A smaller detour occurred through an\nerror by which they missed a loop road which would have avoided\nthe village in which the accident happened.\nThe mother's letter runs :\n\" The whole story, briefly, is this. . . .\nL and M were to spend Saturday night with friends. This plan was\nextended to staying over the Simday night : first alteration in pro-\ngramme. They had this very Monday a luncheon engagement with\nfriends near S . To this already crowded programme they then\nadded the fetching of their sister from the railway station in the\nearly evening. Now the direct route would have been via B\nand not via S ,\nbut alteration No. 2 entailed this latter route.\nThen at the loop avoiding C village, they mistook the rather\nconfusing signpost and instead of taking the by-pass, as was their\nintention, they went on the old road through the village. Just\nbefore the two roads join again the children ran out. They were\n'\nawkward obstacles.' It was the swerving to avoid them which\ncaused the car to overturn.\"\nFeda. She was going somewhere, a little journey, when she passed\nover, and making a detour, a change from the original intentions.\nI gather (said my father who was transmitting this) that there had\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Siftings 149\nbeen one or two alterations in the programme that she was going to\ncarry out just before her passing\u2014and obstacles, awkward obstacles.\nThis was the indirect cause of her death.\nAfter the accident she lingered for several days, being nursed by\nher mother and an Austrian friend, attended by two Austrian maids.\nTwo Swiss cousins had been staying with the family for some weeks\nprevious to the accident.\nFeda. She had just been with and thinking of foreign people,\npeople from abroad. I understand that she had been thinking about\nthose who spoke broken English or another tongue.\nItems correct :\n1. A detour on a little journey.\n2. One or two alterations to the programme.\n3. Awkward obstacles indirectly caused death.\n4. With foreigners.\nThese examples lose in impressiveness by being presented apart\nfrom their context, and by being thus seen in isolation and not\nsurrounded with a group of subsequently verified statements, as was\nthe case with the majority. But our present purpose will be suf-\nficiently served if they should satisfy the reader that statements\nwere made, not easily attributable to chance, which were found to\nagree with facts.\nNeedless to add, I knew nothing of their relevancy, accuracy or\nlikelihood, when recording them at the sitting. After sending a copy\nof my record, I had to wait the applicant's reply before learning\nwhether anything was recognised.\nI have not given examples from my two best cases, \" A \" and\n\" B,\" and have included some from the poorest cases of the series.\nAVhence came the veridical information ? From the applicant, or\nfrom the deceased person we desired to hear from, and whom it will\nbe convenient to term \" the Communicator \" ? Let us discuss each\nalternative, and firstly the probability or otherwise of the veridical\ninformation having had its source in the mind of the applicant.\nNow the outstanding feature of this series is the wide variation\nof result extending as it does from total failure to unquestionable\nsuccess. If there were telepathic contact between the applicant and\nthe medium, why did it fail with one and succeed with another ?\nThe Telepathic Hypothesis.\nIn trying to visualise this telepathic hypothesis, we may suppose\neither that the applicant's unconscious broadcasting is caught by\nthe medium direct, or (which complicates the picture, but possibly\nadds to its interest) we may conceive that the applicant, having\nwritten to me, and so having me more or less in mind, subconsciously\n\f150 The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\nsupplies me with the information. Then, all unaware of the cargo\nthat I carry, I attend the sitting and pass on the information to\nthe medium, subconsciously of course. It is an intriguing picture,\nand vastly important if correct ; but is it true to fact ?\nI return to the question which must run like a theme through\nthis paper : Why should the results differ so widely ? If the medium\nfinds information in my mental field, why does she fail to voice it\nin one case, and yet succeed in another ? It might, of course, be\nsuggested that in the case of successes there was greater telepathic\nforce when the applicant turned his thoughts to me, and that the\nfailures occurred with applicants who were lacking the requisite\ndegree of telepathic energy. Let us, therefore, ask, might variation\nin telepathic energy among the applicants account for the success\nof one and the failure of another ?\nI cannot think that this is a satisfactory explanation. For, in\nscanning experiences of fifteen years with the same medium, I notice\nthat a number of evidential messages have been given as if from\npeople recently deceased, whose relatives had neither appealed to\nme nor expected to hear either from me or the departed.\nMost of these messages contained information which had been\nunknown to me and which I later discovered to be correct.\nAn outstanding instance occurred on my first visit to Mrs Leonard,\nwhen a man who had fallen in the War six weeks previously gave a\nlong and accurate list of identity items. This case \" A \" (see chart)\nis placed in the best class by each of the examiners ; items of infor-\nmation were given which had never been within my knowledge, and\nincluded descriptions of his last days which were confirmed by letters\nfrom his ofiicers.\nAlthough his parents were known to me, it is to be noted that\nthey expected no message and were unaware that I was investigating\nmediumship. Their thoughts had not turned towards me in their\nsorrow. Yet this case is outstanding for its multiplicity of accurate\ndetail.\nAs previously stated there have been similar successes in con-\nnection with deceased acquaintances of my own, in none of which\nhad the relatives any reason to think especially of me or to expect\ninformation from the deceased through me. In short, there was no\nreason why their telepathic thought should supply me with informa-\ntion. Notwithstanding that, the evidential matter was good, in-\ncluding what was unknown to me as well as what was familiar.\nFiu'thermore, I have had some complete failures when the appli-\ncant had not only definitely asked me to obtain messages, but had\nagreed, both by correspondence and also in interviews with me, to\nbe thinking strongly of the deceased and to make mental request\nfor a message to be given at my sitting\u2014of the date and time of\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 151\nwhich I informed him. I am thinldng particularly of a doctor who\ndesired a message from his wife. Not only did we fail, but we\nfailed in repeated attempts. That does not look like telepathy from\nthe applicant reaching my mind and passing thence to the mediimi,\nalthough there is a possibility that the doctor's strong desire may\nin some way have inhibited his subconscious activity. I admit the\npossibility because the conditions which facilitate telepathy between\nhuman minds are so elusive that little is known about them.\nIt is further to be remembered that in this and similar cases there\nwas present in the applicant that strong emotional element which\nis generally believed to facilitate telepathy.\nWith the above failure of the doctor, who was certainly thinking\nof me and of my sitting with Mrs Leonard, compare the result in\ncases where the applicants were not informed that I proposed to\nmake the attempt, where they did not know the dates of my sittings,\nand, if they knew IVIrs Leonard by name, that would be the extent\nof their knowledge (see cases A, B, E, J).\nYet for these people I succeeded, while for the doctor I failed.\nIt does not seem probable that telepathy from the applicants, had\nit been an active factor, was likely to have failed in the one case\nwhere all conditions seemed favourable and to have succeeded in\nthe others where conditions, so far as one can judge, were weighted\nagainst success. However, it may be worth noting that this case\nof the doctor's is the only one in the series where the person asked\nfor had died several years previously. Could this lapse of time have\npresented an additional difficulty ? We do not know.\nAgain, if telepathy from applicants were an active factor, it should\nhave been facilitated in instances where I personally interviewed\nthe apphcant shortly before taking the proxy sitting. I had such\ninterviews in several cases. Were those results at all superior ?\nThey mostly failed. Had mental radiation, or telepathy, or thought\ntransmission\u2014call it what we may\u2014-been in action, one cannot but\nthink it would at least have saved a majority from failure.\nAlthough applicants usually hoped for or expected success, we\nfind that some of the best cases were exceptions, while in all the\nfailures there had been expectancy. This result seems to indicate\nthat expectancy on the part of relatives was not a factor in success.\nLet us proceed to the alternative hypothesis and suppose that the\ninformation passed telepathically from the applicant direct to Mrs\nLeonard. I put this question : Why, if that be so, do we find such\nwide difference in the results ?\nSome of the most likely cases\u2014(I mean cases Kkely to be specially\nsuccessful if this telepathic hypothesis represents what actually takes\nplace)\u2014some of these most liiely cases fail, while others much less\nlikely achieve success. I think, for example, of a member of the\n\f152 The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\nSociety for Psychical Research who wrote to me, hoping for a com-\nmunication from his wife. He had already written out certain\nparticulars and sent them to the officials of this Society. In his\nletter to me he said, \" The unusual nature of what took place, known\nonly to a few friends and to the officials of the S.P.R., would, I thiixk,\nmake such an experiment a valuable one to try. The matter has\nbeen so much in my mind that, if I were the sitter, the explanation\nof telepathy would be hard to resist.\" I promised to try, and he\nhad all the advantage I was able to offer him. Just before my sitting\nhe wrote, \" I will do my best between now and Friday along the\nlines you suggest to ask my wife to attend the sitting. It may be\nuseful for you to know her Christian name, and I have accordingly\nenclosed it in a separate envelope, which you will open or not, as\nyou think best.\"\nI have quoted the above (Case \" R \") to show that the conditions\nappeared to offer a fair opportunity for telepathy. The result was\nfailure. The best he could say of it was, \" It impressed me, as,\nthough there are no striking pieces of evidence, yet the description\nof my wife's character, the reference to the chest and our station\nin life, and most of all the remark about being friendly with doctors,\nall seem to me to be close to the mark.\"\nAccording to my standard of what constitutes success I class this\nresult as much too meagre to rank as anything but failure. Why\nshould it have failed when, on the telepathic hypothesis, everything\nseemed to favour success, including emotional urge, full informa-\ntion about the medium and the time of my sitting, as well as a belief\nin the possibility of communication ? Why did this case fail when\ncertain others succeeded, cases in which such favouring conditions\nwere absent, and where there was no link with me or with the\nmedium, nothing save one letter of appeal which had reached me\nfrom a total stranger ?\nNo case in the series offered more scope for telepathy than that\nof \" W.\" It was passed on to me by Miss Nea Walker after she had\ntried unsuccessfully with mediums.' The husband, a German noble-\nman, was ardently desiring to hear from his recently deceased wife,\nand he readily agreed to do all I suggested with a view to informing\nher of the opportunity offered by my sittings. Many letters passed\nbetween us, one of which I read aloud to the medium before her\ntrance. The man's earnestness and strong emotion were manifest,\nand yet two messages only were given in seven sittings. These were\nevidentially weak, and the result is placed low among failures. Dis-\ntance could not have been the hindrance ; for in the successful cases\n\" C \" and \" G \" the applicants were in Canada.\nFurther, if the information goes from the applicant to the medium,\nhow are we to explain the fact that the messages are expressed as\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 153\nfrom the Communicator's natural point of view, and not from that\nof the applicants ? One could understand telepathy from the appli-\ncant emerging in the medium's mind as a list of disconnected tacts,\nsome relating to the deceased and many others having nothmg to\ndo with him ; but we find, on the contrary, in these messages, the\nwarm vital glow of one who speaks feelingly, as from the other side\nof death, to those left behind. I behave this point merits more\nconsideration than it usually receives. _ .\nVery illuminating in this connection was a series ot sittings m eacn\nof which I hoped to obtain from the recently deceased wife ot a\nsolicitor some messages for her husband (Case \" Q \"). They came.\nThey were characteristic of her. They revealed facts, mcluding\nnames of relatives and their doings, all of which were unknown to\nme \u2022\nfor I had never met the lady although knowing the husband.\nBut he was not satisfied. I found that he was waiting for reference\nto one particular thing about which there had been some difference\nof opinion between his wife and himself. It was not mentioned.\nFinally I put a guarded question which the husband had prepared.\nHe was not satisfied with the result. What he wanted to hear was\nnot said. I could not pry into this old disagreement between hus band\nand wife, but I did gather from his disappointment that, even in\nthe Land Beyond, she kept her own opinion still. I may add, that\nfinally I took him to sit with the medium. The result was the same ;\nthere was no advance in the dkection he desired. Nor did 1 see\nany indication that the Communicator did better evidentially m his\npresence than she had done with me alone.\nWe are for the moment inquiring whether telepathy from the\napplicants might explain the undoubted production of veridical in-\nformation, and I have indicated some observed facts which seem to\nshow that distant telepathy was not the operating cause.\nIn studying the successful proxy cases it is to be noted that their\ninformation is presented in a form markedly different from that\nwith which one is familiar in cases of telepathy or even m what is\ntermed \" psychometry.\" For we find from these Commumcators,\nnot a mere succession of cold statements, nor catalogues of things\nor of actions, but, on the contrary, a something hving. Their remarks\nare not at all suggestive of oddments extracted from a bundle ot\nsloughed off earth memories, nor of contact with a fading \" psychic\ntrace,\" but a hving personality is revealed. Someone is thinking\nabout those once loved and loved still.\nDr W^alter Prince has analysed such typical differences m a note-\nworthy paper. It is entitled \" Certain characteristics of veridical\nmediumistic phenomena compared with those of phenomena gener-\nally conceded to be telepathic.\" It was read before the Copenhagen\nCongress of 1921. In that paper Dr Prince enumerates thirty dis-\n\f154 The Rev. G. Drayton Thomas [part\ntinctions between telepathic and mediumistic messages ; some of\nthese may be of slight importance in themselves, but others are\nimpressive. We find at least a score of contrasts by which the two\nclasses of message may be certainly distinguished. The whole of\nDr Prince's paper is worthy of careful study ; much of it is relevant\nto this discussion, and I quote the following passages (see pp. 112-4\nof the Report, International Psychical Research Congress at Copen-\nhagen, 1921).\n\" In telepathy the great bulk of experimental and spontaneous\ndata show that there is a pre-established rapport between recipient\nand agent, either because each knows that he is experimenting with\nthe other or because of a strong sympathetic bond between them.\nAlso, usually, although the testimony is not uniform on this point,\nsuccess is aided by the two being near each other. But the theory\nthat the best and most evidential cases in Spiritist communications\nare of the same nature, in that the medium derives her information\nfrom the living by telepathy, often requires that\u2014(1) either from\nthe medium's mind must go out something, not only to the sitter,\nbut also, directly or indirectly, to persons unknown to her and per-\nhaps to the sitter likewise, irrespective of distance, and bring back\ninformation from various quarters and directions, selectively adapted\nto the subject in hand. Or (2), that somehow telepathic waves must\noriginate with these various persons in various places, at various\ndistances, which go to the mind of the medium and deftly fill up\nlacunae in the memoranda drawn from the sitter.\n\" We have remarked that the data indicate that the telepathic\ncorrespondences if they are not due to contemporaneous thoughts\nof the agent, seldom seem to go back further than one day. But\nthe telepathy required for such Spiritist cases as we have just alluded\nto must be even more transcendant than thus far pointed out. For,\nwhile one needful or convenient fact for a mediumistic communica-\ntion might, if there is means to do it, be procurable from Aunt Mary\n50 miles away westward, another fact from Grandfather Brown\n300 miles away eastward, another fact from a man living in the\nneighbourhood where father was born 1000 miles away southward,\nand still another fact from one of several persons somewhere in the\nworld acquainted with an excessively rare book in which it is re-\ncorded, it cannot be supposed, especially as the incident may be one\nof thirty years ago, that all these persons were either mentally\nengaged upon their several facts contemporaneously with their re-\nhearsal by the medium, or that they have all thought of them for\nmonths or years. Thus it must be admitted, we would have a tele-\npathic maze in type, range and complexity far beyond anything\nindicated within the circle of telepathy of which we have present\nknowledge.\"\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 155\nSo far Dr Prince. Resuming our search for the originating mind\nin the successful proxy cases, we may inquire whether there existed\nany vahd reasons for anticipating that we should find that telepathy\nfrom applicants had been, in play. It may be said that, on rare\noccasions, telepathic experiments between distant persons have\nsucceeded in transmitting information, but it should be remembered\nthat the few and meagre records of successful experiment in distant\ntelepathy show merely that, occasionally, there have been trans-\nmitted mental pictures of objects, or a list of nouns with an occa-\nsional verb to help out the meaning, or some vague feeling whether\nof unrest or of satisfaction.\nThe transmission of sentences has been rare indeed, and I doubt\nwhether in all the records of psychical research, telepathy has ever\nachieved anything comparable to the completeness and accuracy of\nthe best mediumistic messages. \/\/ the better of my proxy cases are\nthe result of telepathy from the applicants, they certainly represent\nan achievement without parallel in hnown records of experimental\ntelepathy.\nCompare them with Dr Coover's prolonged and multiplied experi-\nments, totalling 14,900, with all variety of Agents, and the result a\ntotal failure. (See Experiments in 'Psychical Research at Leland\nStanford Junior University, California, J. E. Coover, 1917.)\nRecall the failure of the broadcasting experiment conducted by\nthe Society for Psychical Research and the B.B.C., and, finally, of\nthat long-continued and finely planned experiment which Mr S. G.\nSoal and his friends conducted recently for this Society. (See Proc.\nS.P.R., April 1928 and April 1932.)\nWith such failures in mind we realise how great a contrast is pre-\nsented by the flow of veridical information which the better of these\nproxy sittings afford. Most certainly there was some cause operating\nin the latter which was inoperative in all the former. It should be\nnoticed also that, while the above-mentioned experiments failed,\nsome at least among the proxy sittings achieved undoubted success\nunder conditions which would seem far less promising ; for the\napplicants did not know me, they did not know the medium, and\nthere was little or nothing to assist them in directing their thought\nconsciously or subconsciously. Few of them knew the day on which\nI proposed to make the attempt, some of them did not even know\nthat I proposed to try. To have achieved the transmission of so\nmuch accurate information under these conditions is a triumph\nwhich surpasses, so far as I am aware, every extant record of tele-\npathy at a distance. And this superiority in proxy messages, for\nunknown p)eople from unknown Communicators, not only exceeds tlie\nfragmentary success of conscious telepathic effort, but also, I believe,\nof the very best instances of spontaneous telepathy.\n\f156 The Rev. C. Drayion Thomas [part\nI am, therefore, compelled to the conclusion that there is\nno evidence to show that telepathy from the applicants played\nany part in providing the information found in these proxy\nsittings.\nIt may be said, and quite truly, that little is known of the con-\nditions under which thought-transmission can take place between\npersons separated by distance. Nor are we likely to extend our\npresent knowledge until we succeed in effecting telepathic trans-\nmission under conditions which lend themselves to experiment. We\ncannot rest satisfied with proof of the fact, we need to discover its\nmodus oferandi. At present we have hypotheses, but not know-\nledge : indeed, so great is our ignorance that some serious students\nquestion whether telepathy happens apart from some degree of dis-\ncarnate co-operation. They point out that the psychic energy of\nthe transmitter, or the receptive sensibility of the receiver, may\nperhaps be heightened to effective point by the proximity of a dis-\ncarnate Guide or Control ;\nor, alternatively, that such discarnates\nmay actually convey the impression or message which the recipients\nassume to have been telepathic. Without expressing an opinion\nupon this hypothesis, we may say that, so far as the study of re-\ncorded telepathic experiences \"takes us, it provides no data upon\nwhich our proxy successes can be attributed to thought-transmission\nfrom minds on earth.\nHypothesis of the Mediurns Cryptesthesia {Richet),\nor Metagnomy {Osly).\nWe must now ask whether the veridical information was obtained\nfrom the apphcants by the medium. We have pictured the latter\npassively receiving information which arrived telepathically, but let\nus now think of her as reaching out, in some mental or psychic way,\nto search for appropriate facts.\nThe foregoing argument against the telepathic explanation may\nbe used here also quite effectively.\nAgain we are faced by the wide difference in results, many cases\nfail, others achieve success. If the medium's own activity obtained\nthe information, it should have been more uniformly successful.\nThere were some complete failures just where success should, on\nthis hy])othesis, have been most likely, namely in those instances\nwhere I had interviewed the applicant shortly before the sitting.\nSuch personal intercourse showed no superiority over the cases where\nno interview had taken place.\nOne can visualise this hypothetical working of the medium's\nfaculty thus : it enables her to perceive that I hope for messages\napplicable to the deceased relative of the latest applicant : as I had\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 157\nreceived a letter from that applicant his whereabouts can be dis-\ncovered through me : the medium finds him, sets to work iipon him,\nand apposite information is obtained. That is a series of supposi-\ntions placed like stepping stones over a stream. Can we safely trust\nthem ?\nGranting that successes might be thus hypothetically attributed\nto the medium's own unaided faculty, what are we to think of the\nmany failures ? There were several bad failures in cases where the\napplicant and I had been particularly eager to ensure success by\ngiAdng the most favourable conditions. In two instances I took the\napplicant's letter to the sitting. In another I went so far as to read\naloud the letter of appeal immediately before the mediimi went into\ntrance. Such procedure might be expected to stimulate any\nmediumistic faculty capable of procuring informati on ;\nyet those\nthree cases failed completely.\nOn several occasions I changed the procedure by asking my\nregular Communicators, my father and my sister, to try and find\nthe person named in an applicant's letter. This I did during a\nprevious sitting. If, therefore, the medium herself obtained the\nrequired information, there would, in these instances, have been\ntwo weeks at least in which to do so, and one might have expected\nimproved results. Here is what we find :\nAsked for at previous\nsitting : Good to fair 2. Poor 2. Failure 7.\nNot asked for : Good to fair 6. Poor 5. Faihu-e 2.\nThe cases asked for mentally at home were more successful than\nthose asked for verbally at a sitting, and the two weeks' interval\nfailed to ensure success in the majority of the cases which had that\nadvantage.\nBut was it an advantage ? I find no cause for thinking so ; and\nthat makes a further point against the medium's own exploring\nfaculty being the explanation of proxy messages.\nIf the medium herself could obtain information from a distant,\nand, to me, an unknown applicant, much more might she be expected\nto obtain information \/rom me on those occasions when I was re-\nceiving messages from some deceased acquaintance of my own ;\nfor,\nin such instances, my mind was stored with information which would\nafford material for highly veridical remarks. Fishing in my memory\nstores might be expected to produce an extraordinarily good catch\nunder these conditions if such fishing really took place. It is, how-\never, a rare event for communications from my own acquaintances\nto excel in veridical material that obtained in the best class of proxy\nsitting for complete strangers.\nFrom this I argue, with some confidence, that the medium's own\n\f158 T}}e Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\nfaculty is not the factor to whicli we can attribute these proxy\nresults. If my richly stored memory yielded so little when I was\nsitting in the medium's presence, is it likely that the minds of dis-\ntant and unknown persons would yield as much ? And yet one or\ntwo of the proxy cases have not only equalled, but have surpassed\nin evidential richness the majority of communications received from\nmy own deceased acquaintances.\nA review of the whole series prompts the following question. How\nare we to explain the striking avoidance of all statements which\nwould have been inappropriate to the required communicator ? I\nspeak of the successful cases. Had the applicant been the source\nfrom which the information was sent out, or obtained, could the\nmedium in some semi-omniscient fashion have discriminated be-\ntween material which related to the deceased and other material\nwhich did not relate to that particular person ? It is indeed striking,\nto those who receive these messages, to find a selection of material\nwhich can be recognised as having been within the knowledge of\nthe deceased, and an avoidance of everything that was not within\nhis knowledge.\nImagine a control experiment thus : Say that I visit the applicant\nbefore the sitting and am shown over the house where the desired\nCommunicator had lived. I notice, infer and guess. Then I proceed\nto write down some twelve to twenty items about the deceased which\nI consider likely to be correct. Doubtless I should make some good\nhits, but the question of interest is, would I have avoided grossly\ninappropriate statements ? It is most significant that in the better\nproxy messages there is absence of the inappropriate.\nThe proxy case \" A \" which heads the list was asked for mentally\nby me while at home on the day before my first sitting with Mrs\nLeonard. There was neither application nor expectation on the part\nof the relatives ;\nthey did not even know that I was sitting with a\nmedium. These non-application cases might be extended were I to\ninclude instances where recently deceased acquaintances of my own\nspoke at my sittings without being requested or expected by me :\nthe initiative in such cases being entirely theirs.\nIn this connection it should be noted that several acquaintances\nwhom I expected and hoped for have never manifested in my sittings.\nClearly this looks like the action of personal choice on the part\nof the deceased. I have had no compelhng power ; some came\nunasked, some responded to invitation, while others made no\nattempt.\nGuided by the valuations shown in our chart we may look to see\nwhether any of the following variations in procedure led to increased\nsuccess.\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 159\nThe cases may be divided into groups :\n1. In which I personally knew both applicant and Communicator ;\n2. Where I had met the applicant before the sitting ;\n3. Where both appUcant and Communicator were unknown to me.\nSuccesses and failures are found under each of these conditions.\n4. Cases transmitted by my father for the Commimicator ;\n5. Those transmitted by my sister for the Communicator ;\n6. Those transmitted by Commimicator for himself.\nHere again there are best and worst results under each condition.\n7. Cases first introduced by Feda without a word from me ;\n8. Cases where I simply inquired whether any visitors were\npresent\n;\n9. Cases which I had asked for at some previous sitting.\nAgain we find best and worst results under each of these condi-\ntions. In short, there is no indication that any of these variations\ninfluenced results, as they should have done had the medium's\nunaided activity acquired the information.\nIn nine instances the first sitting seemed to call for a continuance\nof the attempt, either because it was specially good, or because, for\nthe sake of the applicant, I was particularly wishful to succeed. In\nno case did the subsequent results differ in quality from the first\n;\nthe evidence may have been less or more in quantity, but the Com-\nmunicator did not surpass the earlier attempt. Case \" C \" extended\nover eleven sittings and the standard of evidence was maintained\nthroughout. These facts are significant and, in my opinion, are\nadequately accounted for by the hypothesis that each proxy case\nhad its own Communicator.\nDoes the sitter's link with applicants favour success ?\nDo we find that when I had some knowledge of the apphcants\nthere was more success than at other times ?\nAt first glance it might seem that acquaintance favoured good\nresults ; for of the five best cases, I had, in two instances, been\nintroduced, while in two others I knew the relatives intimately.\nOn the other hand, consider the nine failures, \" R \" to \" Z,\" in five\nof which I had met the applicant.\nThe twelve cases, \"A\" to \" M,\" are equally divided between\nknown and unknown. Apparently these numbers tell us nothing,\nand we are more likely to discover the answer to our question by\nstudying individual cases. This we have already done when dis-\ncussing the likehhood of telepathy from the applicant being an active\nfactor in success.\nDoes the series show improvement as time went on ?\n\fIfiO The Rev. C.

Neither telepathy passing to her, nor mental ex-\nploration exerted by her, can be held to account for what happened.\nNo effective hnk is discoverable between medium and applicant.\nWhere I personally knew the applicants the results as a whole were\nnot superior, nor when I took with me to the sitting the letters of\nappeal, nor when I asked at a previous sitting for messages. None\nof these variations in approach showed any advantage in result, as\nprobably they would have done had either telepathy or the medium's\nown faculty been the factor in play.\nThose who valued these sittings were alert to the possibility of\nclairvoyance by the medium, but instances where physical objects\nor articles were described seem sufficiently offset by the numerous\nallusions to facts about which clairvoyance could not have assisted\nthe mediimi.\nTo sceptical minds it may seem that in argiiing against other than\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 161\nspiritistic explanation of the facts I have failed to prove a negative.\nThey may suggest that causes at present unknown may have been\nin operation, for which I have not made allowance.\nIt would be helpful if such persons would outline some hypothesis\nwhich, based on knowii facts, might compete successfully with that\nwhich I have offered. It will obviously be futile to say that \" tele-\npathy explains,\" or that \" Cryptesthesia can discover anything\nknown to any human mind,\" or that \" Metagnomic faculty is ade-\nquate to all demands.\" Such assertions are valueless unless those\nwho make them can show in what manner they cover all the facts.\nIt is as easy as vain to suggest that the subconscious activity of a\nmedium can acquire apposite information from any particular person\namong the world's population who happens to possess it. On what\nfoundation is such a theory based ? Has the feat been done apart\nfrom spiritistic conditions ? Is it certain that the information\nobtained was not brought by those who usually in such cases claim\nto bring it ? Where is the force of suggestions resting \" in air,\" as\nagainst the explanations of the messages themselves, fortified as they\nare by identity evidence in favour of the one person who, of all\nothers, would be most Ukely to know ?\nLet the sceptic explain how it is that a proxy sitting can produce\nmore exact information than has ever been attributable to telepathy\nbetween human minds, whether that telepathy was spontaneous or\nexperimental. Should he reply that mediumistic telepathy is sui\ngeneris and its limits unknown, then one may inquire why it should\nbe couched in terms befitting the desired Communicator (about\nwhom the sitter knows riothing) ;\nwhy it should be expressed as\nfrom his particular point of view, and be harmonious with his earth\nmemories while avoiding everything opposed thereto 1 Let it also\nbe explained why this mediumistic telepathy, when emanating from\none Communicator, consistently succeeds in being veridical, while\nfrom another it largely fails.\nI do not propose to consider in detail hypotheses far fetched and\nfanciful, such as :\n1. Memory-traces left behind by the deceased.\n2. Akashic Records, the modern synonym for \" the mind of God.\"\n[ 3. Some other super-mundane Being, angel or devil.\nS\n1 . The memory-trace hypothesis is ruled out by the fact that the\nsource of information usually gives inter alia facts relating to events\nin his family circle subsequent to his decease. One of my proxy\ncommunicators has been conspicuously persistent and successful in\nthus showing his people that he keeps himself au courant with the\nfamily happenings.\nI 2. To attribute the evidential matter to Akashic Records, or to\n\f162 The Rev. C. Drayton TJioinas [part\nthe Mind of Deity, is to abandon the inquiry in sheer despair or\nintellectual laziness. For granting that there might be marvellous\nthought-impressions remaining upon ethereal fields of sensitivity\nsurrounding earth, and without questioning the all-embracing\nmemory of the Omniscient Being, we have no reason for guessing\nthat the former, if interpreted, would take a personal form, or the\nlatter a deceptive and impersonating presentation. That this could\nnot be, one does not say, but that it is so, no one has the slightest\nground for suggesting.\n3. As to unknown super-mundane impersonators, we are similarly\nplaced. Unless there be some definite reason for supposing such a\nsource or sources, it is unnecessary to debate the point. Not unless\nwe fail to discover some really probable origin for the information\ngiven in these proxy sittings should we be justified in leaving the\nproblem unsolved ; and to attribute it to the unknown and the\nunknowable is to relinquish the search.\nThe most probable source of the information will be the mind\nwhich is known to have been in possession of it. There are two\nsuch minds. One is the applicant, whom we have examined and\nacquitted of being an accomplice. The professed Communicator is\nthe other.\nDid the veridical information cmnefrom the desired Communicator ?\nIt is impossible within the scope of this paper to discuss separately\nthe evidence for identity given in the various sittings.\nI have mentioned the rather unexpected and remarkable diversity\nin results. No one can study the sittings without realising that they\nwere originated by intelligent mind. Why did that mind differ so\ngreatly between one sitting and another ? We have agreed to term\nthe originating mind \" the Communicator \" ; can we find any\ncommon feature in the several successful Communicators ? Can we\nfind any feature in which those who failed were alike ?\nA review of the whole series reveals wide difference in ability to\nconceive and express clear-cut ideas. One Communicator can do\nthis, while another fails. It is exactly the difference which we\nobserve among people around us in daily life.\nWhen studying my growing collection of proxy material it pre-\nsently became apparent that neither children nor aged persons had\nbeen particularly successful, but that the honours went to those who\nhad passed over in early maturity. So far as I could ascertain these\nhad all been well educated, intelligent and keen. Since most of the\nfailures occurred with middle-aged or elderly persons, I had drawn\nthe tentative conclusion that old age made success unlikely, perhaps\non account of that fixity of mind and habit which often accompany\nincreasing years.\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 163\nYet, if this were so, then au alert ijitellect, even if of advanced\nage might be expected to communicate as well or better than youth.\nThis conclusion was later supported when a man of somewhat\nadvanced age proved a particularly effective Communicator. His\nrecord is one of the best. It is case \" B.\"\nThroughout his earth Ufe this man had been highly intellectual\nand he was, for many years, a leader of thought, and the editor of\nan important journal. This Communicator put through his intimate\npersonal or pet name known only to his wife and himself as if he\nrealised that such an unusual, indeed perfectly unique name, would\nbe first-class evidence. Further, there has since been discovered\namong his published writings a reference to psychical research in\nwhich he stated that, in his opinion, the diificulty of proving per-\nsonal identity could be overcome by the giving of an intimate per-\nsonal name through a medium.\nConsider another case, H,\" which is valued at 125,000 chances\nto one ; in other words, were we to write off a series of items which\nwe judge might fit the circumstances of the unknown deceased, then\nin 125,000 tries we might hope to find that just one of them was\nas apposite as this proxy sitting !\nIn several of my subsequent sittings with Mrs Leonard this Com-\nmunicator gave evidential messages for his parents, and when they\nsat with Mi's Leonard at a later date he gave further and extensive\nevidence of his identity.\nEighteen months after first speaking at my proxy sitting he played\nthe part of transmitter to Feda for a young public schoolboy, and\nwhile doing so managed to introduce a small identity test for his\nparents. He is called Rafe. I quote an extract from the sitting,\nshowing how the proxy portion was introduced and the part played\nby Rafe therein.\nC. D. T. No less than four people have written asking if I can\nget a message and I have been wondering whether we could obtain\none for either of them this morning.\nFeda. Rafe is here.\nC. D. T. One of those whose mother hoped he would send a\nmessage is a young man probably very much hke Rafe ; for the\nletter that his mother wrote was so like the one I received about\nRafe two years ago. I wondered whether Rafe would know and\nwould help this boy.\nFeda. Rafe had been here all the time. He says, \" I know who\nyou mean, and I know what you mean.\"\nC. D. T. But you don't know the boy, do you, Rafe I\nFeda. Yes, he says, I do ; that is what I want to explain. He\nsays, I have only just got to know him.\nAs the sitting continued, a number of messages were given.\n\f164 The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\nSuddenly Feda said, \" Bird name. Rafe says the name of a bird\nis very important in his family. He wants you to make a note of\nthis bird name.\"\nInquiries at Rafe's home elicited the fact that their old family\nnurse, much beloved by all through many years, was invariably\ncalled, by Rafe, either one of two names. It might be \" Joey,\" a\nname taken from the well-known Parrot Bird that had featured\nlargely in the comic paper he had loved as a child ; the other name\nwas \" Birdy.\" Here I quote verbatim from a letter :\n\" It was\nalways one of these two names he called her, up to the last time\nhe ever saw her a few weeks before his death ; never anything else.\nNurse was a tremendously valued friend of our family. We love\nher like one of ourselves, and Rafe always kissed her right up to\nthe end, as he used to do when a baby. On his wreath nurse wrote,\n'\nFrom Birdy.'\n\"\nThe foregoing is a contribution towards proof of Rafe's identity.\nMy next quotation from the same sitting shows Rafe as a mentality\ndistinct from the boy for whom he was speaking, and also from Feda,\nwho, as we shall notice, criticises him.\nRafe, still transmitting for the boy communicator, said, \" His new\nshoes hurt him, they had been uncomfortable, and I think he had not\nbeen able to wear them. He has told me about his shoes and his\nhat. What the deuce does his mother want to know about his hat\nand shoes ?\n\" Feda here sedately remarked, with reference to the\nday, \" It is Good Friday, Rafe.\"\nRafe, ignoring her interru])tion, continued, \" He kept on saying\n\u2014\n'\nWell, it is true, so you tell her.' But, you know, my mother would\nhave wanted to know more, whether I was happy or whether I\nwanted to speak to her, and whether I wanted to send my love to\nher.\" Here I remarked that it was important to establish identity,\nand that the mother would require several homely touches before\nshe could be satisfied that it was really her boy who had been speak-\ning. Rafe replied, \" I do agree with part of my brain, but it does\nseem '\npiffling '\nto the other part of my brain.\"\nThis Communicator, Rafe, showed himself to be exceptionally\nable in putting through his meaning to Feda ; also he gave evidence\nof identity which was good and extensive.\nBut why should this case excel so many of the others ? If the\nCommunicator were the person he claims to be we have a satis-\nfactory explanation ; for he was an Oxford undergraduate, very\nalive, and very mentally alert when cut off by sudden accident.\nConsider another case which the valuers place in the highest class,\nthat of \" D.\"\nSubsequent to my proxy sitting with Mrs Leonard, the mother\nvisited Mrs Bnttain several times. I have records of those sittings,\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 165\nthe best one of which Mr Saltmarsh kindly valued for me. For that\nBrittain sitting he gives a mark considerably less than that of the\nproxy sitting. Thus, although the mother was present at the Brittain\nsitting, it failed to achieve so high an evidential value as when I took\nthe proxy sitting for a total stranger, and upon the strength of a\nsingle letter of appeal.\nFurther, in one of the Brittain sittings \" D \" remarked that they\nwould find in her little camera three films as yet imexposed when\nshe died. No one knew anything about it, but examination revealed\nthe fact that three films remained unexposed. That is useful addition\nto the evidence given by the Commimicator to prove that she was\nreally the girl \" D.\" Knowing nothing of that camera incident Mrs\nSalter had marked the proxy sitting, \" Good prima facie case for\nidentity of Communicator.\"\nIn order to make out a full case for the identity of these Com-\nmunicators with the two deceased persons from whom their friends\nhoped to hear, it would, of course, be necessary to present much\nmore detail. Sufiicient has perhaps been given to indicate that the\nassumption of their identity fits the facts all round with a neatness,\nsmoothness and a cogency which is not to be foimd in any alter-\nnative hypothesis.\nThere is, as previously mentioned, a conspicuous absence, in all\nthe better cases, of any statement which would be inappropriate as\ncoming from the deceased, but there is also the very significant fact\nthat the messages and evidential items were uniformly in harmony\nwith the personality, characteristics and memories which had been\nthe Communicator's in earth-life. The one exception being that\nthere was revealed in some cases an intimate knowledge of what\nhad been happening in the old home since the Communicator's death.\nFor illustration of this feature I take the following incident from\nthe Eafe (Case \" H \") records.\nFour months after my \" H \" proxy sitting, conversation with my\nusual communicators was interrupted by Feda's remark that Rafe\nwas again present. Several messages were then given by him with\nthe obvious intention of letting his parents know through me that\nhe was able to keep in touch with them. Among these came the\nfollowing :\n\" Ask my mother if she has been thinking of a pillow ?\nI got her thought about a pillow as if it were in some way connected\nwith me.\"\nIn replying to my letter the mother wrote, \" When he passed I\ntook the pillow he had slept on till the day he left and have since\nslept on it myself. When we left home some weeks ago I carefully\nplaced it in his Oxford trunk so that no one else should use it. Since\nreturning I have often thought of taking it out, but postponed doing\nBOj as opening his trunk and seeing aU his belongings would break\n\f166 The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\nme down. However, at the beginning of last week I felt I would\nbe brave and take it into use again. I did so and have been sleeping\non it since.\"\nThe date of this reference to the pillow was given some six days\nafter the mother had taken it into use again ; it was my first sitting\nafter the event. That it was more than chance coincidence is shown\nby the facts, (1) that although this was my 209th sitting with Mrs\nLeonard it was the first time that a pillow had been mentioned ;\n(2) this reference to a pillow was accompanied by three other de-\nscriptions, each perfectly correct, of things recently attracting the\nnotice of his parents. Needless to say I was entirely ignorant of\nthese incidents.\nShould it be argued that the very fact of an inclusion of present-\nday doings in the household of the applicant proves that the infor-\nmation coiild not have come from the ostensible Communicator, I\nam prepared to dispute such a conclusion. For in the long years\nduring which I have been conversing with my father and with my\nsister, through Mrs Leonard's mediumship, they have given me\nscores of ingeniously devised proofs that they are able to ascertain\nsuch information. Indeed they have devised an ingenious method\nby which they inform me of things not within my knowledge, or\nthat of anyone else, which yet prove to be accurate. I refer especially\nto the so-called newspaper test experiments.\nHere, then, is my answer to the question. Why so much diversity\nin these proxy results ? It is the natural outcome of their being\ngiven by different Communicators.\nIn searching for the cause of this diversity in result it has been\nnecessary to consider the ^possibility of its being accoimted for by\ndifferences in the applicants, or variations of condition between one\nsitting and another. In regard to the applicants I recognised the\npossibility that some might be lax and others severe in estimating\nthe relevancy of the messages, and so far as possible I guarded\nagainst this by obtaining detailed reasons for the acceptance of any\nitems as correct. This material has been available to those who\nassisted me in comparing and valuing the records.\nAs to variation in the condition of my sittings from time to time,\nit may of course be said, strictly speaking, that no one remains\nexactly the same physically and mentally from day to day, and that\nslight changes in Mrs Leonard or myself may have affected some\nsittings favourably and others adversely. Yet the general level of\nexcellence in my sittings has rarely varied, and during the period\nover which proxy messages extend there has been no noticeable\nchange. Furthermore, it is significant that where a Communicator\nfailed at first attempt there has never been a marked success when\na second attempt was made. While, on the other hand, four Com-\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 167\nmunicators whose first messages receive a high mark from the\nexaminers of these records, gave excellent evidence on subsequent\noccasions.\nThe wide contrasts observed in the evidential value of these proxy\nmessages would be accoimted for by supposing that the persons who\noriginated them were dissimilar in mental endowments and training,\nsome being clear thinkers and adaptable, while others were not. To\nthose who are prepared to admit the possibility of human survival\nand communication, I ask. Is it not natural that some should have\ngreater aptitude than others for the difficult and delicate operation\nof transmitting their thoughts through an intermediary, and of\nmaking suitable selection of evidential matter ? We know how\nwidely aptitude for selection and expression of ideas is found to\nvary in mankind. Some can select with finer judgment and can\nexpress themselves with greater precision ;\nthis being so on earth,\none is not surprised to find indications of it in communications from\nthe discarnate. And further, few of us can have failed to notice\nhow widely people differ in their regard for relatives. Not all feel\nthe same urge to set at rest the minds of friends who may be anxious\nabout their welfare or desirous of hearing from them. Such differ-\nences may quite naturally persist in the life after death, some being\nvery desirous of commmiicating, others much less so.\nIn this diversity of mental ability I find a cause for the wide\ndifference shown in my series of proxy sittings, a difference ranging\nfrom comjilete failure to clear-cut success. Everything looks as if\nactual Communicators had been present, and that they varied in\nability to make successful use of the opportunity.\nPsychic Suitability.\nIt would appear that the Communicator's mental ability during\nlife is not sufficient by itself to ensure clarity and accuracy in com-\nmunicating : for in the list of failures, it is noticeable that the three\nlowest of all, viz. '\nX,\" \" Y \" and \" Z,\" ought to have been suc-\ncessful had the possession of intelligence been the one necessity.\n\" X \" was elderly, but he was a King's Counsel. \" Y \" was an alert\npubhc schoolboy, and \" Z \" a conspicuously intelligent lady.\nEach of these succeeded in putting through a few indications of\nidentity, but their average of success was spoilt by the amount of\nunrecognised material. I believe that in each of these cases I was\nin touch with the person desired : their failures I cannot explain\nsave by supposing that their messages were blurred in transmission.\nExperience has gradually led me to the opinion that, just as all\nsitters do not suit all mediums, so all Communicators do not suit\nall Controls. There may well be some subtle disharmony of dis-\nposition which hinders psychic intercourse. Do we not sometimes,\n\f168 The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [PAET\nwhen conversing with oxir fellows in daily life, experience a sense of\ndistance which resists all our efforts to overcome it ?\nThe superiority of some Communicators over others is remarked\non by Mrs Sidgwick when referring to one of Mrs Leonard's sittings\n(see Proc. S.P.R. (1921), xxxi. \" An Examination of Book Tests \") :\n\" There seems, so far as we can judge from eight sittings, to have\nbeen a proportion of success considerably above the average in the\nbook-tests received by her \"\n(p. 265).\nAnd in Proc. S.P.R. (1923), xxxii, 612-3, the Editor comments\nupon the same subject :\n\" Some Communicators appear to have a\nmuch greater success in carrying out book-tests than others. ... If\nchance were the only factor in the Leonard results, there would be\nno reason why one Communicator should have more success than\nanother. . . . Tests given in association with one supposed Com-\nmunicator show a much higher percentage of success than those\ngiven in association with another.\"\nIt is certainly striking to find in proxy sittings a repetition of this sig-\nnificant difference in result ;\nproxy messages, like book-tests, are more\nevidentially successful with some Communicators than with others.\nOn page 265 of the above paper Mrs Sidgwick remarks :\n\" The\nfact . . . that each sitter has his or her special Communicator and\nthat for book-test purposes they form an inseparable pair prevents\nour being able to judge whether a higher average of success ... is\ndue to qualities in the Communicator, or the sitter, or the com-\nbination of the two.\"\nIn the proxy sittings now under consideration this difficulty is\nremoved ; for in every instance the sitter was the same. I think\nit may, therefore, be assumed, with some confidence, that the high\naverage of success in several of my cases results from their originat-\ning with Communicators who were better able than others to over-\ncome the difficulties incident to the task.\nThese difficulties were twofold, first the selection of evidential\nmaterial and secondly its transmission. My constant Communi-\ncators, who are my father and sister, would appear to give a certain\namount of assistance in the transmission ;\nsometimes, indeed, one\nor other of them gives the messages to Eeda, despite the fact that\nthe desired Communicator is said to be present. They explain that\nin such cases they considered that there was much more hkelihood\nof the messages being accurately transmitted if given by them than\nif the novice should attempt it. Meanwhile the presence of the latter\ngives them some assistance in recollecting the agreed-upon messages\nand evidence. That such an aid might be useful is not difficult to\nbeheve ; since the amount of detail pxxt through is frequently more\nthan one would cheerfully volunteer to remember accurately without\nsome sort of assistance.\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 169\nIt sometimes happened that a Communicator who, while not wholly\nfailing, was far from achieving a satisfactory result, yet managed to\nput through one or two items of evideiice which rather redeemed\nthe performance. It was the kind of thing which suggested that\nthe hoped-for Communicator may very well have been present, even\nin those sittings which failed completely, and perhaps doing his best\nunder difficulties which he could not surmount.\nConcerning the difficulties of Communication.\nWhy do we find vagueness and confusion alternate, in some Com-\nmunicators, with excellent evidence ? Why do we find the omission\nof what one would have expected, and occasionally one glaring in-\naccuracy in the midst of a long and otherwise accurate description ?\nThese are questions which apply to mediumistic communications in\ngeneral, but are especially pertinent to our discussion of proxy cases\nin which we can rule out at least two of the suggested explanations.\nWe can, I think, safely take for granted that (1) in proxy sittings\nthere is no telepathy from the sitter, and (2) no other means (psycho-\nmetric, clairvoyant, community of sensation, etc.) whereby the in-\nformation is provided by the sitter. Thus we need not discuss the\nhypothesis that vagueness and omissions are to be attributed to a\nmedium's imperfect perception of what is in the sitter's memory or\nconscious thought.\nThe uniform testimony of my Communicators is that they are not\nat their best when entering the conditions essential to the medium-\nistic transmission of their thought. Those who are capable of nice\ndistinctions aver that the difficulty relates to their surroundings\nand not essentially to themselves. Their favourite illustration is\nthat of the diver : when under water in his diving suit the man is\nlimited by his conditions, although remaining perfectly himself. All\nhe achieves must be done while he is fettered by the very apparatus\nwhich makes his stay in the waters possible. He handles articles\nbut clumsily through his thick fabric covering ; he walks heavily\nwith weighted soles, his vision obscured by helmet and the dim\nunderwater gloom. The illustration may be still more apposite if\nwe picture the latest deep-water diving apparatus.\nThe Italian salvage ship, Artiglio, in 1932 recovered treasure from\nthe bullion room of the sunken P. and 0. liner Egypt, which lay\n130 yards down on the floor of the Bay of Biscay. Divers could\nwork only in favourable weather. They were lowered in heavy steel\nshells or cases provided with windows 12 inches thick to withstand\nthe immense pressure of the deep water. They could do little more\nthan peer into the gloom and telephone directions to their comrades\nfor moving them up and down, back or forward; for the placing of\nexplosive charges, and, later, of the grabs by which the treasure\n\f170 The Rev. C. Drayton Tliomas [part\nwas lifted. Their efforts to reach a favourable position from which\nto enter the wreck, or to place explosive charges upon it, were often\nfrustrated for hours at a time by the force of the ever shifting\ncurrents.\nWith this illustration in mind we may note what was said by\nRafe (Case \" H \"), who gives the impression of being an acute\nobserver.\nRafe. If sitters had better memories they could help us a great\ndeal. To begin with they might often help us to sift out, in these\nrather difficult conditions, many things that, without meaning to,\nwe make rather a muddle of. It would help us, in a way I find it\nrather difficult to exjDlain, if people would say that we spoke of\nso-and-so last time, but that this and that were not quite right.\nWe might then sort out our impression in this condition.\nC. D. T. You find the conditions of a sitting difficult ?\nRafe. I find it difficult sometimes to know if I am giving the\ndetails correctly. I think I have something to say, but while I am\ngetting my facts ready, I often forget which I have already given.\nI am not quite sure, and I may have a little difficulty in getting it\nagain. But if someone would remind me and tell me something\nabout it which would not spoil the evidence in any way, that would\nbe of very great assistance.\nC. D. T. Now, as a medical student with some knowledge of\npsychology, how do you explain this bewilderment that comes over\npeople when they communicate ? I take it that you do not feel it\nin yom\" own sphere. What is the cause of it ?\nRafe. I do not think it is anything in themselves. I think it is\nthat they are, what you might call, at sea. It is a physical con-\ndition, as I understand it. You might put it in this way : a man\non a platform\u2014I am speaking of the earth now\u2014feels and speaks\nall right. The same man with the same qualities goes up in a balloon,\nor on the top of a mountain, or in an aeroplane, to a certain altitude\nwhere the conditions of the atmosphere, which are physical con-\nditions, afl^ect him mentally. They so affect him that probably he\nwill have difficulty in thinking ; I have heard of such cases where\npeople could not think. Then again, what is an anaesthetic ?\nSomething that interferes with your thinking apparatus. It is a\nphysical thing again. Yet, what does it do to a man ? The same\nman who was previously quite clear headed is now prevented from\nthinking clearly. There is something which is, in a way, analogous\nin the physical condition or atmosphere of the sitting which affects\nour consciouness. Your Father terms it \" the power.\"\nC. D. T. Do you never get any such feeling in your own sphere ?\nRafe. Oh dear, no.\nThat some Communicators could not overcome the obstacles and\n\f130] ^-1 Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 171\nso avail themselves of the opportunity afforded by the proxy sitting\nwas, I think, neatly shown when I took applicants to sit with Mrs\nLeonard. I did this with the three cases, \" V,\" \" Q \" and \" L,\"\nbecause these Communicators had more or less failed, and I still\nhoped we might achieve success. I was also wishful to discover\nwhether the Communicator would be able to do better when the\napplicant was present.\nIn considering the results I was led to the conclusion that the\npresence of the applicant at the sitting made but slight difference\nto the quality of communication received. The material was usually\nmore, but not better ! My impression was that, in each case, the\nCommunicator felt additional interest in the occasion, but was\nunable to make his achievement equal his intention.\nWhere the failures were complete I may have been unsuccessful\nin my attempt to attract the attention of the required persons,\nand if, in such a case, I asked my father or my^sister to help, they\nmay have failed to find the right person.\nIt must be remembered that I had but httle clue to give ; a mere\nname is not much guide when seeking a person in a far-stretching\nland.\nThere is, in the opinion of my Communicators, a real possibility\nof their bringing the wrong person. When introducing case \" D,\"\none of the best, doubt was expressed as-to whether they had brought\nthe one for whom I hoped.\nDuring my years of study with Mrs Leonard, I have given close\nattention to everything calculated to throw light upon the pro-\ncesses which lead up to the spoken message. Always the sitting\nproceeds exactly as if Feda, the Control, were receiving information\nfrom another person and doing her best under difficulties to catch\nthe meaning clearly and then pass it on through the medium's vocal\norganism.\nShe often stops to say, \" A\\Tiat ? I have not got that !\n\" or she\nwill say, \" Wait, I lost something then, come a little nearer.\" At\ntimes she seems to be catching the speaker's actual words, at other\ntimes it is as though she caught only an idea, but an idea which is\nprogressively clarified point by point till all is plain.\nWhen she cannot catch words, or ideas, from the Communicator,\nshe tells me that she is \" getting things from him \"'\n; but this pro-\ncess of \" sensing \" is as a rule much less accurate.\nSo far as I am aware this explanation of the modus operandi, like\nthat of the reahty of the Comnuuiicator, fits the facts in every way.\nIt will be noticed that whether Feda received the messages from\nthe desired Commimicator direct, or from my father or sister speak-\ning for that Communicator, the result was unaffected. Each m.ethod\nhad its failures and each had its successes. Perhaps the record\nK\n\f172 The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\npoints to greater likelihood of success when the Communicator does\nnot personally undertake the difficult task of giving his messages\ndirect to Feda ; for it will be observed that the best cases were\ngiven, in whole or part, through my father or my sister. What they\nhave to say about the advantages of this arrangement may be read\nin extracts from their conversation ; the following are quotations\nor, in some cases, summaries of their remarks. Some of these were\nvolunteered in the course of the sittings, others were given in reply\nto questions. These explanations seem to me logical, consistent,\nand in no way contrary to any real psychological knowledge we\npossess.\nHow do my Communicators account for the presence at the\nsittviig of the 'person from whom I desire to hear ?\nTwo extracts from the records will supply the answer. I take\nthem from cases previously mentioned, Rafe the Oxford student\nand Miss M .\nRafe {Case \" H \"). Three hours before attending the sitting I had,\nin my study, re-read the letter of appeal and had mentally called\nthe boy, asking him to notice his mother's wish to hear from him,\nand saying that I would give him the opportunity that afternoon.\nI asked him to notice if my father and sister were present with me\nin my study, and, if he saw them, to ask them how to proceed.\nVery soon after the sitting commenced, Feda suddenly said,\n\" Have you been asked to help a boy ? There is one here, he was\nin a rush to come.\" Having given a number of evidential points,\nthe Commimicator said (while transmitting through Feda, the Con-\ntrol), \" Please give them my love and say that I am all right and\nquite happy now, and that I knew they were going to write to you.\nI followed it up and got your thought and followed you here. I\ncould not make her hear me in that\u2014what ? (exclaimed Feda) It\nwas no use going there. He says, she was washing her hands in a\nbathroom when you came. But (interjects Feda) she would not\nknow ! He could not make her understand, so came on into this\nroom with you.\"\nTowards the close of the sitting I inquired whether the Communi-\ncator had noticed my call in the study, or if he had come to the\nsitting on his own initiative ? Feda replied, \" Your father and\nsister were in your room when he went there, and they brought\nhim here with them. Your sister says. We told him to get close to\nthe medium, and that is why he went to her on arrival when she\nwas in the bathroom.\"\nLater still in the sitting, while my father was controUing person-\nally, I asked how he had come in touch with this youth. He rephed\n\f130] A Consideratio7i of a Series of Proxy Sittings 173\nthat it was in my study, and added, \" We did not know why he\nwas there, but gathered that later.\" I asked if he had been able\nto see the youth both in the study and during the sitting. My\nfather replied that he had been able to see him in the study more\neasily than during the sitting.\nMiss M {Case \" D \"). The case \" D \" is the only one placed\nin the best class which I had mentioned at a previous sitting. What\nI had then said was as follows :\nC. D. T. Now here is another case. A lady writes about her\ndaughter, who was killed in a motor accident. Two children rushed\nout and caused the accident which resulted in her death. The\nmother writes that it would help a great deal if she could get a\nmessage from her daughter. Shall I attract her to the study ?\nFeda. He thinks that would be a very good thing to do. He will\nhave a look round. He will try what he can do.\nI now add extracts from the sitting of two weeks later.\nFeda. Mr John [i.e. my father) says he wonders if he has found\nthe right girl, he calls her a girl, Feda calls her a young woman.\nHe has forgotten if you mentioned anything, but this girl is about\n19 or 18.\nC. D. T. I had her age as 18|. How did you find her ?\nFeda. He says in the study.\nC. D. T. Good, that is where I tried to attract her attention.\nFeda. He says, she felt the study. And your thoughts must have\nacted like a paper trail\u2014Etta says that\u2014like a paper trail.\nC. D. T. Or like a telephone call ?\nFeda. Yes, but something more than that because, Etta says, a\ntelephone call does not show you the way. You do something more\nthan that with your thought when you direct it from your side to ours.\nC. D. T. They can be attracted by the thought, and then they\ncan follow the thought to its source. Is that the statement ?\nFeda. Yes, Mr John says, if you could throw a very long line to\nus, and we catch hold of the end and follow it hand over hand.\nYour thought is like a line.\nC. D. T. What I can't understand is, how my thought reached\nthe girl.\n\u00bb Feda. He says, it is something more than thought, as you under-\nstand thought. You say to yourself, \" I miderstand so little about\nthis girl, I know so little of her. How can I think of her strongly\nenought to attract her to me in my house of which she knows\nnothing ?\n\" Well, there is something more in it than that. It is\nyour intention, the natiu\"e of your thought, more than the actual\ndefined form in which you put your thought. I wish I could find\na word to describe this something at the back of thought\u2014the\nthought at the back of thought. I think you will guess what I mean.\n\f174 The Bev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\n(Feda interjects, \" I don't think anybody could, Mr John.\") He\nsays, Well, you know what you are trying for, you know you are\ntrying to help a girl to get in touch with her mother. The mother's\nthought is also definitely centred on the girl. She may have even\ntold her in thought that she wants a message through you. That\nhelps, but apart from the mother doing so, your intention is felt.\nYou need not define the thought, the inner thought. The thought\nthat matters is there, and is picked up.\nC. D. T. I wonder if you could clear up this ? My thought goes\nout, the girl catches it, but where does my thought go 1 To her only,\nor does it go out in all directions like the shout of a voice, or a radio\nmessage, or the light of the s\\m, so that she would have caught it\nwherever she might be 1\nFeda. He says, Not quite so easy to catch it wherever she hap-\npened to be, but in this case I think she did catch it where she\nhappened to be, and found her way to the study. But if she hap-\npened to be in the neighbourhood of the study it would make it\neasier.\nC. D. T. Well, then, the thought goes out like radio and it hap-\npens to attract her attention, and she is able to feel from what\ndirection it comes.\nFeda. Yes, unless other sounds (thoughts ?) are crossing. There\nis a difficulty we are very much up against. Now, he says, I did\nnot know much about this radio when I was here, but it is analogous\nto the thought-commimication between your world and ours ; and\nundoubtedly, just as you get, I know from observation, a cross inter-\nference, muddles, interminglings of a perplexing kind, in that, so can\nyou in this communication by thought from your world and ours.\nWe who make a definite study of this communication are less\nlikely to be confused because by practice we become experts in\ntransmitting and receiving. You may become a good transmitter,\nas we are good receivers ; we respond quickly, and easily distinguish\nyour call from the others. Of course, when you try to get in touch\nby thought with a new person, a new receiver, then it nearly all\ndepends on you, but even so, it depends partly on the nature, tem-\nperament, and natural ability, the receptive and intuitive qualities,\nof the new receiver. If this girl had happened to be a dense, unre-\nsponsive, unsympathetic, stupid person, you would not have got the\nresponse you have.\nC. D. T. That is very interesting.\nFeda. And, he says, here again we come into our old subject, my\nfavourite one, the importance of developing the soul- qualities before\nyou arrive.\n(Later in the sitting and while messages were being transmitted) :\nFeda. The girl is here, but Mr John is giving it.\n\f130] A Considerafion of a Series of Proxy Sittings 175\nC. D. T. He is getting it from her as he gives it ?\nFeda. Yes, he says, he was afraid of trusting to his memory re-\ngarding almost a stranger.\nThis, as I have said, was one of the two successful cases in which\nI had asked my father and my sister at the previous sitting to assist\nin bringing the desired Communicator. The resiilts demonstrate\nthat they succeeded in the quest.\nThe following paragraphs contain remarks made by my father and\nsister about these proxy commimications. For economy in space\nI have frequently abbreviated.\nMy sister Etta once remarked, \" Sometimes when you ask us to\ntry and get in touch with so-and-so, we have to say that we do not\nknow if we can, we will do our best, but are not sure of success.\"\nSept. 1929. Most of those whom we bring have been to some\nextent coached beforehand. We ad\\'ise them to get their material\nin order, points first, second, third, etc. Now, if they are asked a\nquestion in the midst of their communication it will quite possibly\nlead to confusion, a mixture of two or three separate things ;\nso that\nit is wisei to take what is said and leave questions until afterwards.\nApril 1930 {Case \"i \").\nFeda. They have been doing their best to obtain information\nfrom the girl for whom you ask, and they have also brought her\nthis morning. She has talked to us about her evidence, and Etta\nwill now give it, endeavouring to remember what she has been told.\nEtta says, I will supplement my memory with what the girl may\ntell me here and now, but if she tells me anything that disagrees\nwith what she told me previously, I shall have to inform her that,\nin this confusing condition of the sitting, she is not recollecting\nclearly.\nYou see I am able to remember somewhat better than a newcomer\ncan be expected to do.\nJuly 1931 {Case \" E\" a young boy).\nFeda. Etta is now giving what she has been told by this boy, and\nfurther, she adds some things which she has sensed from him.\nC. D. T. You mean that the boy has told part and Etta has felt\nthe rest 1 Is that a safe way of obtaining it ?\nFeda. It is the only one with children because they can't express\nthemselves and tell you everything completely. Etta says she would\nhesitate to adopt this method with an adult, but ^vith a child she\nfinds it best to get some information from them and then add things\nshe had observed and obtained herself.\nJuly 1931. My Communicators explained that in these proxy\nsittings they sometimes deemed it best that they should themselves\ntransmit information obtained from the desired Communicator\nalthough the latter might be actually present in the sitting.\n\f176 The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\nOn some occasions the Commnnicator was not present at the\nsitting, while at others he was not only present but himself giving\nhis thoughts to Feda. I therefore inquired why different methods\nwere adopted. The following was the reply :\nFather. Sometimes we find the person would not be a good Com-\nmunicator. Some are much better at the task than are others, and\nif a person is a poor communicator his presence at the sitting would\nbe more hindrance than help. In such cases we conclude to give\nwhat we can in his absence.\nWe may, of course, be mistaken and underestiniate a person's\ncapabilities ; that is quite possible because we are dealing with\npeople about whom we know little or nothing, and we have to judge\nas you would judge the caj)abilities of a person who applied to you\nfor a post of some kind.\nThere have been occasions when a Communicator, whom we had\nconcluded would do well, has found the conditions of the sitting too\nbaffling for him. You must remember that in the majority of these\ncases it is a first-time experience for the Communicator ; and not\nonly have they never made the attempt before, but during their\nearth life they were unacquainted with this subject. Even when\nthey have the making of a good Commimicator, inexperience in the\ntask causes many gaps in their communication ; as you will have\nnoticed in such cases, we have sometimes helped them through and\nadded to their statements.\nIn view of the many difficulties which arise in bringing novices,\nit may be said that on the whole the most reliable method would be\nfor us to obtain the material and ourselves give it to Feda. This\nwould usually result in a more faithful reproduction of what the\nperson wished to give than if he were trying to give it himself ; but\nthere is one thing which we could not give so well, and that is the\nidea of his temperament and character. Feda usually obtains this\nvery faithfully when a Communicator is transm.itting to her. There\nis a further disadvantage when we transmit on behalf of the Com-\nmunicator. It is that it prevents the possibility of his warming to\nthe task as he proceeds. When a Communicator can do this the\nprobability is that he finds several things occurring to him cpite\nnatm-ally, good, evidential points that easily slip from him to\nFeda. I think it is only the good Communicators who warm to the\ntask ; those of inferior capacity remain cold and restrained. It is a\ncondition very much like that of nervousness in public speaking.\"\nAt this point my father referred to one of the younger proxy\nCommunicators, the medical student who has been uniformly suc-\ncessful, and remarked of him, \" he was vital and warm.\"\nContinuing, my father added, \" Sometimes you have had an older\nperson who has lived many years on earth with self-contained and\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 177\nrestrained habits of thinking and acting. That person is not so\nUkely to warm up, especially in the early stage of communicating.\nHe will be cautious and self-restrained and rather over anxious ;\nbecause these are the habits to which he has accustomed himself.\nThe conditions around the medium are rarely stationary. There\nis something always fluctuating, ebbing and flowing, in these sittings.\nWhen I have been speaking for some time Etta may suddenly per-\nceive that the condition of the power is one that she can use much\nbetter than I, and if she notices that I am losing my hold on the\nhne, so to speak, she will seize it.\nC. D. T. I have noticed that in proxy sittings Etta has acted as\ninterpreter for several while you have rarely acted that part.\nFather. There is a good reason for that. I think I might have\nacted as interpreter, but Etta was specially gifted for the role. Not\nonly had she studied this subject before passing over, but had been\nnaturally a good intermediary between people when on earth. She\nhad the gift of bringing people out of themselves, of talking easily,\nand yet was very sensitive. In many ways she was more adapted\nfor this work than I had ever been. I know that I could act as\ninterpreter in these proxy sittings, but I think Etta would naturally\ndo it better.\nI had asked my father how he explained the failure of some of\nmy proxy attempts.\nFather. In view of my present knowledge I should suggest several\npossible explanations. Firstly, we may have contacted the wrong\nperson ;\nfor, as you know, there are usually several people waiting\nto send messages through you. There may be points of similarity\nbetween two of them, and we do not receive much clue as to the\none who is required. We often have to do a considerable amount of\nprobing before we are satisfied that we are in touch with the right\nperson, and we have sometimes proceeded a considerable way before\ndiscovering that we have been on the wrong track.\nStill, I think the more we can obtain upon the least clue you give\nus, the more satisfactory it will be.\nNow the second reason for failure is the unquestionable difficulty\nin transmitting to you the information we receive. It might be as\nwell to mention in this connection that when we meet the right\nperson and talk to him in your study, we may possibly catch some\nideas coming from the minds of others around you there, I mean\nother would-be Communicators. In our conversation with the one,\nwhile in your vicinity, we may involuntarily receive thought that\ndo not belong to him, and so father them upon the wrong person.\nI think this is quite possible, although I hope it is unlikely. It\nwould be entirely unlikely to happen were we speaking with the\nCommunicator on our own plane, but you must always remember\n\f178 The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\nthat when we are in the earth condition, which is not onr own, no\nmatter how accustomed we may have grown to it, we are liable to\ncertain errors we could never make in our own sphere.\nC. D. T. Might we assume provisionally that the successful proxy\ncases were those in which you met the Communicator on your own\nplane and that the failures were those in which you met him only\nin the earth conditions ?\nFather. I do not think you can adopt that as a certain rule,\nalthough there is something to be said for it broadly and generally.\nFeda. Etta says, the lady you are asking for is here, but I am\nspeaking for her, it is best for me to hold the line.\nC. D. T. I remarked to my father that in stiidying the proxy\nsittings I found that the Communicators who succeeded seemed to\nsucceed uniformly ; that if they had a second opportunity they were\nagain successful, while those who failed, failed again if given a second\nopportunity.\nFather. That is interesting and helpful to me, and it agrees with\nwhat I have always thought, namely, that some Communicators are\nmore fitted for the work than are others. Some people would not\nacquire facility for the task until they had been over here a con-\nsiderable time, or until they had had much practice.\nEtta. I am sure that much is explained by a difference of tem-\nperament or habit of thought.\nC. D. T. That would be a satisfactory conclusion in the case of\nthose who came and spoke direct to Feda, but it is not easy to\nharmonise with the failure of several cases where you first obtained\nthe information and then yourself transmitted it to Feda.\nEtta. I have often been in touch with a would-be Communicator\nbefore the sitting and have obtained information from him, but you\nwill recollect what we have often said about the difficulty in re-\nmembering even our own affairs in the conditions of the sitting. It\nis more difficult to remember someone else's, much more difficult\n;\nso I often ask Communicators to come with me, if possible, in order\nto reinforce my memory of what they have told me. If they can\ndo that and do it well, then I am on fairly safe ground, but if they\ncannot, I am on very unsafe ground indeed.\nI think we have had a considerable amount of success, but it has\nbeen a difficult thing to do. It is probably one of the most difficult\nbranches of this work.\nC. T). T. I understand you to say that, if you are giving it on\nbehalf of the Communicator and the latter is present in the room,\nthen his presence reinforces your memory. Am I to understand that\nthe Communicator is listening to what you say and will correct you\nshould you make a inistake ?\nEtta. He may be listening, but even his hstening powers are some-\n\f130] A Consideration of a Series of Proxy Sittings 179\nwhat blurred while in this condition. If you can imagine the sitting\ntaking place on our own plane then he could easily say, \" Stop, that\nis not correct.\n'\n' When father and I are speaking through the medium\nhere, even we cannot always check each other.\nIn Leonard WooUey's fascinating book, Digging up the Past, he\nsays :\n\" The prime duty of the field archaeologist is to collect and\nset in order material with not all of which he can himself deal at\nfirst hand. In no case will the last word be with him ; and just\nbecause that is so his publication of the material must be minutely\ndetailed, so that from it others may draw not only corroboration\nof his views but fresh conclusions and more light. Should he not\nthen stop at this ? It might be urged that the man who is admirably\nequipped to observe and record does not necessarily possess the\npowers of synthesis and interpretation, the creative spirit and the\nliterary gift which will make of him a historian. But no record can\never be exhaustive. As his work in the field goes on, the excavator\nis constantly subject to impressions too subjective and too intangible\nto be communicated, and out of these, by no exact logical process,\nthere arise theories which he can state, can perhaps support, but\ncannot prove ; their truth will depend ultimately on his own calibre,\nbut, in any case, they have their value as summing up experiences\nwhich no student of his objects and his notes can ever share. Granted\nthat the excavator is adequate to his task, the conclusions which\nhe draws from his own work ought to carry weight, and he is bound\nto put them forward ; if they are palpably wrong them his observa-\ntions also may justly be held suspect.\"\nIt is in this spirit that I here record my impressions. The appeal\nfrom earth brought response from those who had left earth. They\ndid what they could to prove their identity. Several succeeded and\nso brought to their sorrowing relatives much comfort. Others were\nless successful. Such variations in ability to communicate success-\nfully, though medium and sitter were the same for all, I attribute\nchiefly to wide differences in the mental ability of the several Com-\nmunicators. Besides which, there were probably differences of other\nkinds, in some cases, perhaps, a pre-occupation in post-mortem\nactivity ; for it may be doubted whether all would feel an equally\nurgent wish to speak with those left behind.\nI attribute the veridical information to the actual persons from\nwhom their friends desired to hear ; for although I kept an open\nmind for the possibility of intrusion from other sources, I found no\nevidence for anything of the kind.\nThese conclusions are based on my experiences with Mrs Leonard ;\none cannot say positively how far they may, or may not, apply to\nother mediums and to other methods of experiment.\n\f180 The Rev. G. Drayton Thomas [part\nAPPENDIX.\nCase \"A.\" Ralph Gould.\nThis is a case where the relatives of the deceased were not expect-\ning messages from him, and were unaware that I was sitting with\nmediums. i\n. -w''\nI had been twice to the Gould's house, but that was some eight\nyears before this sitting. I knew the three sons slightly, but had not\nseen Ralph, who is the subject of this incident, for some years.\nRalph went to the war. Just after Christmas, 1916, it was\nreported that he had been killed. A short account appeared in the\nMethodist Recorder which ran thus :\n\" Our church at Beckenham has suffered a heavy loss in Second\nLieut. Ralph B. Gould, who died in Mesopotamia of wounds received\nin action, on Dec. 20th. He was the eldest son of Mr and Mrs\nGould, Croydon Road. In the summer of 1915 Mr Gould received\na commission, and was gazetted to the South Wales Borderers.\nIn September of that year he was drafted to GalUpoli, and was present\nat the evacuations of Suvla Bay and Helles Point, at the latter\nplace being wounded. After a short period in Egypt he was sent to\nMesopotamia, and took part in the actions before Kut in the attempt\nto relieve General Townshend. Mr Gould was loved by all who knew\nhim. Previous to joining the Army he was a member of the choir\nand a most valuable worker in the Svmday School, being assistant\nsecretary and then secretary for several years.\"\nMy first sitting with Mrs Leonard, to whom I was a perfect stranger,\nwas on 3 February 1917.\nBefore going to this sitting I had earnestly thought of two or three\npeople whom I hoped might take the opportunity of speaking with\nme there. One of these was Ralph Gould ; I was exceedingly sorry\nfor his parents and felt that it might comfort them if I were able to\nprove that Ralph had spoken 'ftith me.\nEarly in the sitting Feda said :\n\" A young man wants to speak. He is not very, very tall, yet\nabove average height ; well built, not stout, fine figure, rounded\ncheeks somewhat narrowing towards chin ;\ngood character, medium\nmouth, nose slightly bridged otherwise straight ;\neyes medium\nbrown, eyebrows dark brown ;\nstrong good forehead ; short hair\nthat sticks up a bit in centre of front, brushed away from front and\ncut close at sides.\"\nAll perfectly accm-ate with the possible exception of nose and eyes.\nHis parents think there was no bridge, although they themselves\nboth show it. As for the eyes they were not sure of the exact\ncolour.\n\f130] Appendix. Case \"A.\" Ralph Gould 181\n\" He passed over suddenly. Not much pain. There was a quiek\ndizzmess and choJving feeling, not actual pain. He was full of lite\nto the last day, cheerful and full of life.\"\nAs the War Office cable, received on Christmas Day, merely said\n\" Died from wounds, bullet wounds in head,\" it had been assumed\nthat Ralph died in hospital. Not till the morning of the day on\nwhich I took this sitting did his parents receive the letter from his\nOfficer stating that Ralph had died in action. On the evening of\nthe same day came a letter from the Chaplain saying, \" Throughout\nthe march, which commenced at 3 a.m., we were together and indeed\nwe used my mount to carry our gear as we walked together. When\nfiring commenced we were under some sort of cover and out of danger\nexcept for stray bullets, one of which struck him in the neck, and\nbefore I could catch him up (I had remained behind to water my\nhorse), he was dead.\"\nFeda continued :\n\" There were two sides to his mentaUty, the serious and the jolly.\"\nThis was very true, much more true of Ralph than of the majority\nof young men.\n\" There was a rushing noise in his ears before he, what you say\n'\ndied '\n; the last he knew was that he felt dizzy and choky, but he\nwas quickly unconscious.\"\nThe family doctor stated that the symptoms here described would\nbe just what one would expect to follow a shot in neck or head.\n\" At the time he had been standing on something uneven, it seems\nto Feda like scrambling up something.\"\nThis is perhaps the most interestingly evidential statement of all\n;\nfor it was unknown to anyone in England, and many months elapsed\nbefore its verification was possible. The Chaplain did not mention\nit in his letters to the family. After the War I interviewed him.\nHe said that their company had been progressing along the bed of a\nstream and \" Gould was a bit up one side the bank when he was\nstruck by a stray bullet.\"\n\" He walks round you and puts his hand on yotu- shoulder. Per-\nhaps he means that he used to do that.\"\nHis mother says that he always did so when wishing her good-bye.\nThe others recollect this habit of his.\n\" He says '\nR '\nand '\nE,' '\nC No it is '\nG,' and close to that '\nG '\nthere is '\nR '\nand '\nE.'\n\"\nFeda, as I have often observed in later years, easily mistakes\ncertain letters. This '\nE '\nis wrong ;\nRalph's initials were R. B. G.\n\" He could not believe that he had passed over when he woke,\nthought he was in hospital. (In whispers) Whd,t do you say ?\nWhat ? TeU me carefully.\"\n\" At first he thought that he had been huxt, that he had been\n\f182 The Rev. G. Drayton Thomas [part\nwounded, and he wondered whether others knew what had happened.\nHe saw people walking round him and touching , him and making\npasses over him. He felt some difference in the air, something\ndifferent too in his surroimdings. He asked whether he would be\nthere long l And they said, '\nYou are all right now.' They said,\n'\nSit up,' and I felt well, but hazy and unable to remember about\nthings as I ought to do and as I wanted to do. They said, '\nYou\nhave passed and are in the spirit world.' I could scarcely believe it\nat first. I had expected something different, not so solid, or so\nfamiliar. I was disappointed at first, hxxi am not disappointed now.\nIt is all so interesting.\"\n\" He thinks he told you this before through someone else. He\nthinks through a woman, middle aged and rather dark ; that is his\nimpression. He could not get much through. He gave some\nname, but he felt muddled and could not do it ; said that he was\nhappy and was getting on well.\"\n\" He has seen you with a man who is elderly, spare in build, grey\nmoustache, who seemed a little nervous and was psychic. A pale\nman, drawn and even haggard. This man worried him because of a\nfunny, abrupt manner, so that one wondered if something were\nwrong. He doubts if he got through. Yet it was better, more likely\nto have succeeded, than with the woman. The woman was two or\nthree months ago, say three.\"\nI was unaware of any such attempts, but my father, who came\nthrough unmistakably at this same sitting, had succeeded in\nmanifesting his presence through Mr Vout Peters with whom I sat\non 15 and 29 January. Since Ralph came with my father to this\nfirst Leonard sitting, it is quite possible that he made unsuccessful\nattempts at those two sittings with Peters. If so, he was wrong\nin supposing that the first attempt was with a woman medium, and\nhe is rather wide of the mark as to the time which had elapsed since.\nNote that he \" felt muddled,\" and that the description of the second\nattempt is strikingly like Vout Peters as he then was, when a period\nof ill health made his work difficult. Since Gould's death my only\nsittings had been those two with Vout Peters.\n\" His age would be somewhere about 24 years.\"\nI should have thought of him as \" over 20,\" but learn that he\nwas then twenty-four.\n\" His mother is elderly, is living, but not in London.\".\nThis was correct.\nHis appearance suggests that he passed within a year, or within\na few months.\"\nActually it was less than two months. As I was still quite\nuncertain of the communicator's identity, I asked for his name.\nFeda replying said, \" He builds a '\nC \"\n\f130] Appendix. Case \"A.\" Ralph Gould 183\n\" He had been a journey before tie died. It was taken in three\nstages. He had gone a shorter journey before the end.\"\nGould's three stages in the War were Gallipoli\u2014Egypt\u2014Mesopo-\ntamia. Then going up the Tigris he fell, some miles north of\nKut. \u2022\nI was unaware at the time how perfectly applicable was all the\nabove to Ralph Gould ; and so, wishing to ascertain if the com-\nmunicator might be Gould, I asked if he could say where he had\nlived. My expectation was that, if Gould were speaking, he would\nat once say \" Beckenham,\" for I was then unaware of the difficulty\nwhich names present to a communicator. Feda repeated my\nquestion in a whisper. This was followed by further whisperings,\nand then the word \" suburbs \" was spoken hesitatingly. Feda\nthen continued :\n\" Outside the suburbs. He lived in a proper house with a garden.\nThe house stands alone, or with not more than one joined to it.\nThere are two stories. It is not quite square. (Here followed\nan endeavour to describe the roof, conveying to me the impression\nof a roof broken by some architectural device into two levels.)\nNot very new. There is a garden gate and Feda sees its pillars. A\npath, not quite straight, leads from gate to house, with green beds\neach side of it. The entrance hall is wider than a mere passage ;\non entering it there are doors on either side, then comes the staircase,\nand the passage past the stairs. He was fond of this house and goes\nback in thought to it.\"\nAll the above is absolutely accurate. I now felt fairly sure that\nRalph Gould was speaking, because I recognised that some at least\nof these items were descriptive of his home, viz. Outside suburbs\n\u2014\nproper house\u2014standing alone\u2014garden\u2014two stories\u2014not very\nnew\u2014doors both sides passage.\n\" A river or some water is not far off, though this may not be\nanything considerable. The ground seems to slope up before the\nhouse, and behind it looks to go up as if it became a little hilly.\"\nI believed at the time that these three items were incorrect, and\nwas much surprised to discover later that they were perfectly\naccurate. The water is invisible from the highway, being a stream\nand lake in the grounds of Ralph's old school, which is situated not\nmany yards from his home. In front the ground slopes gently\nupward to a ridge which looks even higher than it is because crowned\nby trees. At the rear rises Sydenham Hill, with the Crystal Palace\nwell in view.\n\" There is a window that goes down to the floor, a '\nFrench\nwindow '\n; in the room where this window is he used to like to be.\"\nEven had I remembered this French window, which I did not, I\ncould have known nothing of Ralph's preference for that room.\n\f184 The Rev. C. Drayton Thomas [part\nHis mother says that he would go there directly on returning home\nand play the piano there by the hour.\n\"What do you say? \" (This was said softly and followed by\nwhisperings.) \" He was fond of a ball game, a small hard ball.\nHitting it, and, he says, '\npushing.' He laughs about this pushing,\nit is some joke. He hit the ball by swinging his arm like that.\"\n(Medium's arm swings freely.) \" He played it a good deal, and\nhe still does so. He thinks it wonderful that he can. He says\nit is a compensation ; he likes to be able to play the same game\nstill.\"\nKnowing nothing of Ralph's recreations I supposed this meant\ngolf. But his parents recognised an allusion to his two games,\nbilliards and tennis. He was very fond of the former, and was a\nfine, free-swinging tennis player.\n\" He tries to give '\nP,' a name. Tries . . . (Here came several\nwhispered attempts, apparently not satisfactory ; then tentatively\ncame Peterson ? Patterson ? More tries and then given up.)

Introduction.\nThe book An Experiment with Time, by Mr J. W. Dunne, is probably\nknown to many readers of this report.- In this book Mr Dunne gives\nan account of certain personal precognitive experiences in dreams.\nSo far there is nothing particularly novel in what he describes. It\nhas long been regarded as a possibility that precognition sometimes\noccurs, and the Society has collected and published a good deal of\nmaterial bearing on this possibility.^ What was new and striking\nwas Mr Dunne's conclusion that precognitive dreams are as normal\nand as much to be expected as dreams of the past.\nThis suggestion goes far beyond previous notions on the subject,\nand, at the suggestion in particular of Dame Edith Lyttelton and\nRear-Admiral the Hon. A. C. Strutt, it was decided to make some\nexperiments of the precognitive element in dreams.\n1 Read at a Private Meeting of the Society, 4 January 1933.\nIt was reviewed by Mr S. G. Soal in the Journal, xxiv. 119.\n^ Mr H. F. Saltmarsh has been studying this material for some time and\ntells me that about 3.50 cases of supposed precognition are printed in the\nSociety's Proceedings and Journal,\n186\n\fPART 130] Report of an Inqiiiry into Precognitive Dreams 187\n2. The Experiment : First Series.\nIt seemed best to experiment in the first place with persons of\nknown critical outlook, psychological knowledge, or other appro-\npriate qualifications. A limited number of members of the Society\nwere accordingly invited to take part in the experiment and 25 (the\nnumber aimed at) consented. To these subjects were sent the\nfollowing instructions, which were revised and approved by Mr\nDunne, though he made the reservation that in his opinion the\nrequest for independent corroboration was an unnecessary pre-\ncaution.\n\" One of the outstanding characteristics of dreams is the rapidity\nwith which they are forgotten. Therefore make a point of trying\nto remember your dreams as soon as you wake up, the moment you\nrecover consciousness. Keep the copybook and pencil mentioned\nbelow within easy reach of your hand, and as soon as your dreams\nbegin to come back to you write them down. Don't wait for them\nto take on shape or meaning but write down what you remember\nas you remember it, bearing in mind that it is impossible to know\nin advance which detail may be the important one. Be careful to\nwrite down what you actually experienced in your dream as well\nas your interpretation of it ;\ne.g. if you found yourself in a big\nbuilding you thought was a church, you should describe it, and add\n'\nwhich I supposed to be a church.'\n\" Having written down your first memories, additional details may\ncome back to you. If so, write these down also, but distinguish\nclearly (by drawing a line across the page, for instance) between\nfirst memories and later ones.\n\" A copybook and pencil are being sent to you herewith to enable\nyou to keep a copy of your notes. Please use this indelible 'pencil,\nand please remember that your notes should be completed and for-\nwarded (i.e. go out of your possession) before you read your paper or\nletters or do anything else. Please send the perforated page or pages\nforming the top copy to me at the Society for Psychical Research,\n31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1, and keep the carbon copy\nforming part of the book (you will find the carbon at the end of the\nbook). Continue this procedure for three weeks, making a record,\nif possible, each morning. If you are unable to do so, continue until\nyou have made twenty-one records.\n\" If anything occurs which you regard as a confirmation of one\nof your dreams (as a whole or in part), please write an account of it\nat once (not of course in the copybook) and send it to me. If the\noccurrence is easily verifiable (e.g. something in the newspapers), it\nis only necessary to send the relevant cutting. But if the event is,\ne.g. a passing occurrence in your immediate environment, it is im-\nL\n\f188 Theodore Besterman [part\nportant to have it independently confirmed. The simplest way of\ndoing this is to have your account read and signed by a witness of\nthe occurrence. Should it be impossible to obtain such corroboration\nplease send your account nevertheless.\n\" As dreams are quickly forgotten even when they are written\ndown, it will be advisable for you to re-read your account for the\nlast two days carefully each evening in case you have overlooked\nsome detail and to re-read the whole of your records once a week.\nAll such reading should be done very slowly and with frequent\npauses for consideration, since a dream incident may have a setting\nwhich differs entirely from the background of the real, waking event\nwhich is dreamed of, and this may militate against immediate\nrecognition of the connection.\n\" It should be noted that the connected waking experience may\nbe your reading of the incident in a book, or seeing it in a play,\nprovided, of course, that such book or play is entirely new to you.\n\" All records will be regarded as confidential and no names will\nbe published without permission.\nTheodore Besterman.\"\nFive members then dropped out. The remaining 20 sent in the\nrecords of a total of 265 dreams, covering nearly a thousand pages.\nThese were carefully endorsed, studied, and filed, and they were all\nre-read once a week during the eight weeks for which the experiment\nwas allowed to continue. At intervals letters were sent to the sub-\njects ui'ging them to continue their efforts and to keep a good\nlook-out for confirmatory events.\nThis number of 265 dreams from 20 subjects represents an average\nof 13-25 dreams per subject, or very nearly the number aimed at,\nfourteen, twenty-one having been asked for to make sure of getting\nthe smaller number. The results obtained were as follows : 20 sub-\njects sent in dreams, 14 advanced no precognitive experiences, and\nthe remaining six recorded 7 such experiences (about 2-6% of the\nwhole number).\nWe must now proceed to examine the seven cases put forward\nby the subjects, in order to see what their evidential standing is.\nAs the cases are so few they will be presented in full.\n(1) Subject 4 writes as follows in his second record (24-25\nMarch, 1932) :\n\" A series of little action pictures on a ship which\nseem to show all that goes on in the early part of the morning.\nThese pass rapidly before me as if I am being given a resume of the\nactivities of the ship's company and I remember best shaking out\nmore canvas to catch the early morning breeze and the decks being\nswabbed down.\n\" Then I find myself, as one of the crew, lying on the deck up in\n\f130] Report of an Inquiry into Precognitive Dreams 189\nthe bows. The day is very bright, the sea very blue, and the deck\nbeneath me vividly warm with the sun's rays. No land is in sight\nthough I feel we are not far from land. I am wearing clothes, not\nunHke the uniform served out to British Naval ratings in warm\ncKmates and yet subtly unlike as if the uniform were foreign.\n\" Now\u2014being awake\u2014I for some reason interpret this as Greek\nNaval imiform and the scene as being on the Aegean, but I do not\nknow why.\n\" Attracted by some bread I have a host of small gulls, are swoop-\ning round me and the word '\nKittiwake '\ncomes to me strongly in\nthe dream. But one of the gulls is very much larger and greedier\nthan the others. It has something peculiar about, or wrong with,\nits head ; I cannot clearly see what.\nThe subject comments (26 March, 1932) :\n\" On Friday evening\n[25 March], being in London and having nothing to do, I went to\nthe Rialto Cinema Theatre in Coventry Street at 6 p.m.\u2014when its\ndoors opened. The first film shown was a review of British Sport\nentitled '\nBe a Sport ' and contained\u2014among much relating to other\nSports\u2014some pictures of yacht racing showing the Britannia com-\npeting with other yachts. The photographs were, several of them,\ntaken from amidships looking forward over the bows of one of the\ncompeting yachts and showed in the foreground a part of the deck,\ntackle, and the curve of the sail, with some of the crew lying on the\ndeck.\n\" Beyond all this could be seen stretches of bright, sunlit sea and\nsome of the other yachts\u2014but no land.\n\" All this bears some resemblance to my dream of Friday morn-\ning : The boats were of about the same size as the one in my dream.\nThe weather and sea were the same. The uniforms of the crew were\nsimilar as also was the view of the forepart of the boat. There was\na photograph of putting out more sail.\n\" On the other hand the view of the bows of the boat was not\nmore than similar. In my dream I had been alone up in the bows\nand had been surrounded by gulls of which I did not see one in\nthe fikn.\n\" Your circular letter invites me to write if I regard an incident\nas confirmation of my dream. This is to put on me an onus that\nshould, I think, be partly borne by you since you are collecting the\nrecords of these experiments. I should not call the above events\nconfirmatory but if I were keeping a series of records I should note\nsuch occurrences and begin to be impressed if they were frequent.\n\" This letter will be signed and each page of it initialled by [name\nand address omitted] who was with me on the evening concerned.\n\" Before I close I will add that I rarely visit a cinema and have\nnot done so for nearly two months. Also that I have not passed\n\f190 Theodore Bestermmi [part\nthe doors of fclie Eialto for over a week and as far as I can determine\nno pictures of this particular film were on view at the doors. How-\never, I often do pass the Rialto, and some such pictures may for-\nmerly have been exhibited there. Moreover, I am told that this film\nhas recently been shown in another, \u2014and therefore, perhaps, in\nseveral others\u2014West End cinemas. I am often in the West End\nand might have unconsciously seen advertisements of it.\n\" Yet I do not think I have done so.\"\nThis statement is endorsed by the above-mentioned witness : \"I\nagree entirely with this written account of the Film shown at the\nRialto on Friday March 25th.\"\nThis subject states the case very fairly himself, and there is no\nneed to add anything to his own remark, \" I should not call the\nabove events confirmatory.\"\n(2) Subject 7 writes in his first record (23-24 March 1932) :\n\" I\ndreamt I saw a letter for me on the breakfast table. It was poised\non a cup. The address, which was written, was slightly smudged\nat left hand side. The envelope was foolscap size, inscribed '\nOn\nHis Majesty's Service '\nbut white in colour. I remember thinking\n'\nIt's a wonder they didn't register that letter.' I did not actually\nsee the address although I knew the letter was for me. There was\nno one in the room when I walked in and saw the letter.\n\" I seemed to know that the letter related to the conversion of\nsome National Savings Certificates.\"\nThe subject comments (31 March 1932) :\n\" I received yesterday,\n30 March 1932, a letter endorsed '\nOn His Majesty's Service '\n(see\nDream dated 24 March 1932) and I append a comparison between\nthe various statements in the dream and what actually happened.\nThere does not seem to be much of interest in the comparison, but\nI take it you want anything that may seem, even remotely, to have\na bearing on the dreams. [I have added the numbers in square\nbrackets.\u2014 Th. B.] (See pp. 192 and 193.)\nGeyieral Notes.\n1. This was my onlj^ dream about these certificates.\n2. The coincidence of dates :\nDream : Night of 23rd.\nCommunication : 22nd (altered to 24th).\n3. Letter not registered. But\n4. Of course the receipt of some communication relating to the\nconversion of the certificates was inevitable, sooner or later.\n5. The fact that a month had elapsed since the date fixed for con-\nversion made the receipt of a communication probably imminent.\"\nHere again the siibject has provided an admirable commentary,\n\f130] Report of an Inquiry into Precognitive Dreams 191\nto which nothing need be added. The coincidence of dates is of\ncourse significant, since if the incident were in itself sufficiently\nstriking to merit further analysis, it might be attributed to\ntelepathy.\n(3) The same subject writes in his sixth record (30-31 March\n1932)\n:\n\" I was expecting, in my dream, a registered letter. It did not\ncome. I thought '\nThe postman, finding no-one at home, has just\nput the letter in the letter-box and signed the receipt himself.' I\nwent to the Luton General Post Office to inquire. I was told the\nletter had been delivered and that they had my signature to that\neffect. I repHed :\n'\nBefore we go any further you had better take\nmy signature for comparison.'\n\"\nThe subject observes (31 March 1932) :\n\" A registered letter did\narrive for me this morning. My housekeeper signed the receipt.\"\nClearly there is only a feeble amount of coincidence.\n(4) Subject 13 writes as part of his ninth record (3-4 April 1932) :\n\"... Another, larger, lake among pinewoods, which an American\ncompanion would call '\njungle,' to my annoyance. A boat laid up\non a sort of floating dock. Another boat, a small steamer, came to\na landing-place. Someone told me that the steamer would call both\nsides of the lake as long as the other boat was laid up.\"\nThe subject comments (4 April 1932) :\n\" When I saw (8.45 a.m.)\nin to-day's Times the obituary of D. H. MacBrayne, on whose\nsteamers I have often travelled, I thought of the last part of last\nnight's dream [i.e. because the scenery of the dream was associated\nby the subject with the MacBrayne steamers]. But I had a sus-\npicion that I had seen of the death before and find it was in Satur-\nday's [2 April 1932] Times (death-column).\" Again no further\ncomment is required.\n(5) Subject 14 writes in her first record (24-25 March 1932) :\n\" I dreamt I was out walking with my M., and a governess who\nappeared to be a foreigner. I am not sure whether I. (my daughter)\nwas there or not. M. fell over the edge of a small pond which was\nconcreted round. There was only about a foot of water in the pond\nand I was in no fear of his drowning, but thought he might hit his\nhead. I jumped into the pond myself, getting my feet wet, and\nhanded him up to the governess. We then started to go home and\n'\nI woke.\"\nThe subject comments (25 March 1932) :\n\" It is perhaps just\nworth noting that w^hen I came back from Frinton in the late after-\nnoon of that day I. told me the nursery party had all been '\nin the\nI\nmarshes '\nand got into the mud '\nM. too.' This is the first time this\nyear they have been there (it is not a winter walk) and the first\ntime M. has ever been there on his own feet.

The connection with my dream is\nhowever very sKght. There is no pond in the marshes and no\nconcrete.\"\n(6) Subject 16 wi'ites in her eighth record (11-12 April 1932) :\n\" I was at a co-education college but I was older. A self govern-\nment committee of students decided everyone should go naked.\nThe majority did so. I was uncertain but did, only I was embar-\nrassed and kept my arms crossed and remained sitting.\"\nThe subject sent a cutting from the Daily Herald of 12 April 1932,\nwhich she regarded as \" the only possible bit of evidence.\" The\nmessage in the paper is headed \" Clothes Drown Girl Nudist,\" and\nreads as follows :\n\" Mile. Madeleine Boucher, a pretty 20-year-old member of the\nnudist colony at Physiopolis-on-Seine, near Paris, was drowned\nyesterday because she was too well clothed.\n\" Mile Boucher, who was in a canoe with M. Paol, another young\nnudist, had dressed to leave the nudists' island sanctuary for the\nmainland.\n\" When they were in midstream the canoe capsized, and the girl\nwas carried away by the current and drowned.\n\" An investigation disclosed that her water-logged clothes were\nresponsible for her death.\"\nHere the sole point of contact is the reference to nakedness. The\ncutting might indeed be more plausibly regarded as a confirmation\nof a passage in the same subject's first record (27-28 March 1932) :\n\" Dream of a river with a strong current, we played a game of being\nswept away. One girl was swept away.\"\n(7) Subject 20 writes as part of her third record (27-28 March\n1932)\n:\n\"... I called on a mother and daughter (imknown and cannot\ndescribe). They were living in a very new house\u2014woodwork was\nall quite un])ainted. I was having tea (or coifee) out of blue and\nwhite cups, blue came in alternate stripes and was a dark sort of\nCrown Derby blue. Somehow we went upstairs, with cups in hand,\nto look at the house. At the top the stairs stopped short before a\ntop landing. There was a i^ery wide dark board bridging the chasm\nl)ut I hate heights and planks, and my cup crashed to the floor in\nthe hall, and I went downstairs refusing to look at top flat. I picked\nup the cup, which was not much damaged and looked at base for\nname of maker to replace. Got it, but can't recall, except it was\none name and a place-name. Found the handle was intact and a\ncurious flat square shape pressed against the cup. ... In fact I don't\nknow what broke at all about the cup. Talk of replacement and\nI woke.\"\n\f130] Report of an Inquiry into Precognitive Dreams 195\nThe subject writes (5 April 1932) :\n\" Last evening, 4th April, I went to play bridge with friends\nnearby. Our coffee was served in cups each of which was different\nfrom the other. I had never seen these cups before, and my friend\nsaid she had had them five years but had never used them till\nyesterday. They w^ere good ones, and Worcester china. Two of\nthem were dark blue ground with gold inside the cup. The third\nwas blue and white, in stripes, the blue being the sort of dark blue\nI had seen in my dream. But, at first I did not notice the resem-\nblance because the shape was different, it was a straight shaped cup,\nnot the more '\nbasin '\nshape I had seen, and the stripes were even\nin width, whereas the ones in the dream had been wider at the top\nthan at the base. Also there was a little gold pattern (conventional)\nover the blue stripes which I had not noticed in my dream. Also\nthe handle of the cup was quite an ordinary shape, gold, not Kke\nthe one in my dream, which had seemed a feature. We did not go\nupstairs, it is not a very new house, and there is no mother and\ndaughter there, but a husband and wife. I did not break one of\nthe cups either. But I did, before I noticed the resemblance, pick\nup one of the other cups and look at the base for the 2iame of the\nchina. This was because I made a remark about the three cups as\nvery pretty, as soon as I saw them. The other two were quite\nunlike the striped one, it stood alone. It was also bigger, and the\ncup I had seen was a good size. I should say bigger than the one\nlast night.\n\" I don't suppose this is of any value, but had better send it for\nwhat it is worth.\"\nThis concludes the description of the incidents put forward by the\nsubjects themselves as possibly of precognitive interest. Case 4 is\nclearly a case of cryptomnesia. In cases 3, 5, 6 and 7 the amount\nof coincidence is so slight that it would be improper to assume the\npresence of any element of precognition. This leaves two cases,\nNos. 1 and 2, in which there is a prima facie case for precognition.\nNeither of the cases is of more than moderate value.\n3. The Experiment : Second Series.\nMr Dunne suggested the possibility that the age of the S.P.R.\nsubjects (averaging roughly 45-50) had militated against success,\nand the experiment was therefore continued with a group of Oxford\nundergraduates. Mr H. H. Price, Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford,\nand Lecturer in Philosophy, kindly co-operated and a group of\ntwenty-two undergraduates undertook to record their dreams. They\nreceived the same instructions as the S.P.R group, and, in addition,\nMr Dunne addressed them on the subject. They sent their records\n\f196 Theodore Bestermnn [part\nin closed envelopes to Mr Price each morning, who forwarded them\nunopened in a covering envelope to me. They were then treated\nin the same way as the S.P.R. records.\nThe Oxford undergraduates proved somewhat less persistent than\nthe S.P.R. group, partly owing to the incidence of examinations.\nThe twenty-two subjects produced a total of only 148 records (an\naverage of under seven), only one of them completing the course\nand sending in the full number of twenty-one records. On the other\nhand, the Oxford group claimed many more precognitive dreams\nthan did the S.P.R. subjects. Of the twenty-two Oxford subjects\nten did not claim any such dreams ; the remaining twelve included\nmost of the persistent subjects and sent in 1 13 records. These twelve\nsubjects claimed 32 precognitive dreams between them ; to this\nnumber has to be added one apparent precognition not noticed by\nthe subject, and pointed out by Mr Dunne. Not by any means the\nwhole of these 33 dreams are put forward very seriously as pre-\ncognitions. A number of them were merely sent in as possibly of\ninterest. I do not therefore propose to take up the space that would\nbe required by describing the whole of these cases in full, and I will\nmerely summarise them.\n(1) Subject 03 describes in his first record (19-20 May 1932) a\ndream in which he saw a map of Northern Europe, with Finland\nand North Russia prominent ; there were other details. On the\nafternoon of 20 May he walked into the room of a friend who had\nopen before him a map of Scandinavia and Finland ; none of the\nother details was confirmed. The incident is corroborated.\n(2) Subject 04 in his eighth record (31 May-1 June 1932) gives a\nfull description of a complicated dream. A few points in this are\nreferred to by him in the following passage :\n\" On Wednesday\n[? Tuesday, 31 May] night I had a discussion with someone about\nthe pre-Raphaelites. Afterwards I dreamed that I was in Trafalgar\nsq. and went down some steps till I saw a notice up to the Lyall\ngalleries. When I sent in the result the record of the dream I put\n'\nTate and Lyle '\nin brackets. On Friday I read in the Times that\n'\nLeonard Lyle of the famous firm of sugar refiners '\nhad received a\nknighthood. ...\"\n(3) Subject 05 describes in his second record (19-20 May 1932)\namong a number of other things a car and children meddling\nwith it. He writes that on the morning of the 20th he received\na letter with news of a motor accident. \" Details were quite\ndifferent.\"\n(4) Subject 010 writes in his first record (23-24 May 1932) :\n\" I\ndreamed a date, 1917, and a figure, 65, were mentioned to me signifi-\ncantly.\" This subject sends a cutting from the News Chronicle of\n24 May, 1932, on the front page of which is a long article, during\n\f130] Report of an Inquiry ivto Precognitive Dreams 197\nthe course of wliich, among other figures, and widely disconnected,\noccur \" \u00a36,500 \" and \" 1917.\"\n(5-17) These all occur in the records of Subject Oil, twelve of\nthem put forward by herself and one by Mr Dunne. This subject's\nrecords are the best in accuracy and thoroughness of recording of\nany of those who took part in the two series.\n(5) In her fourth record (29-30 May 1932) Subject Oil describes\nthe opening by a friend of a parcel by slipping the strings round the\ncorners. On 30 May she herself opened a parcel of the \" same size\n\"\nby slipping the string round the corners. Actually the size is not\nmentioned in the record.\n(6) Later in the same record the subject writes of some friends\nlearning German and of a small boy, who does not know French,\nlearning German by gramoj)hone. On the evening of 30 May it was\nsuggested to a friend, in this subject's presence, \" that she should\nlearn German and then she should do some more French, in that\norder.\" Corroborated by two witnesses.\n(7) In her seventh record (1-2 June 1932) Oil goes to see some-\nbody in her room in college about some money matters which are\nnot quite straight. Three weeks later the subject settled some\nfinancial matters with the President of the Junior Common Room.\n(8) In her tenth record (4-5 June 1932) this subject describes a\nseries of incidents in which honeysuckle plays a part. On 5 June a\nfriend with whom the subject was walking thought she smelt honey-\nsuckle. \" Later in the day we passed a cottage with honeysuckle\nin full bloom by the door. It was the first I have seen this year\nand had the same yellow and purpUsh colours as the '\nhoneysuckle-\nseed '\nof the dream.\" Corroborated by the friend in question.\n(9) In the same record Subject Oil describes a dream in which\nshe was dining at high table, saw the Principal coming in in a grey\ndress of a material like georgette, and took soup flavoured with\ntomato. On 14 June \" the Principal [of Somerville College] wore\nfor dinner a grey georgette dress which she had not worn before.\nThe soup was not flavoured with tomato ; but tomatoes were served\nas a vegetable.\" The grey dress is corroborated by the Principal.\nI (10) In her eleventh record (6-7 June 1932) the subject writes in\npart :\n\" Find myself in a small room as though hastily arranged for\na meeting. I am sitting in the front row in a low chair. M. R. H.\nis on my left in a high one. There are railway posters on the left\nwall of a room. A man comes in to speak. He is sunburned and\nwears a dressing gown. He says he is a railway director and has\nbeen to Chelsea for a holiday. . . . My mother gives me some tea\nknives to polish and to put away. ...\" On 7 June the subject \" was\npresent at a conversation which turned largely on holidays. Later\nin the same conversation someone mentioned the Polytechnic at\n\f198 Theodore Besterman [part\nChelsea. 1 do not think I had spoken or thought of Chelsea for\nsome time. . . . During the conversation I was sitting to the right\nof [M. R. H.]. I was sitting on a chair much lower than hers. A\nlarge picture in the room was more than once referred to as a poster.\nJust before the conversation she had borrowed two of my tea knives.\nAfterwards I put the knives which had been used together on a tray\non the table.\" Corroborated by M. R. H.\n(11) In the same record the subject writes :\n\" As I woke I heard\nvery clearly the phrase, '\nThe Times, dreams of four men.' \" The\nsubject writes :\n\" Mr Dunne has pointed out to me that this is\nprobably connected with John Buchan's latest book, The Gap in the\nCurtain, which is based on An Experiment with Time and deals with\nthe successful efforts of four men to get a provisional glimpse of a\npage of the Times.\" In a letter dated 7 September 1932 Mr John\nBuchan states that his book was first published and reviewed on\n7 July and that it was \" largely inspired \" by Mr Dunne's book.\nThe subject states that she first read the book at the beginning of\nAugust.\n(12) In her fifteenth record (10-11 June 1932) Subject Oil says\nto J. B. that she thinks a certain language may be Norwegian or\nFinnish. She writes :\n\" In the course of conversation with her\n[J. B.] on June 11, I said I hoped that she had been working hard\nat Norwegian grammar. The remark was unusual as it was purely\na slip of the tongue. I meant Old Norse.\" Corrborated by J. B.\n(13) In the same record the subject writes :\n\" I look for letters.\nThere are some folded forms in the pigeon-hole, a book of stamps\nand a number of photographs. Coloured photographs are also pinned\nround the pigeon-hole. One of the forms is addressed to Miss Lee\nand I wonder why it should be in the H pigeon-hole.\" This sub-\nject's name begins with H. She comments :\n\" On June 11th there\nwere a number of notices round the pigeon-hole, one of them bright\norange. It was a notice that unstamped letters should not be put\nin the letter-box. I found a note addressed to Miss Richmond and\nwondered, as in the dream, why it should be in the H pigeon-hole.\"\nCorroborated.\n(14) Still in the same dream the subject saw, with various details, in\na play or film, a number of people she supposed to be prisoners in a\nlarge building like a church. During a conversation on 12 June \" the\nsubject of church services in prisons was discussed.\" Corroborated.\n(15) In her sixteenth record (11-12 June 1932) Subject Oil writes :\n\" Look out of the window and see a small boy dressed as a Red\nIndian. He is practically naked and his skin is coloured. More\nsmall boys come to meet him\u2014normally dressed. ... I look into a\ngarden and see a kind of bridge which they have made. I wonder\nwhere they have got so much wood. The handrail is formed of very\n\f130] Rejjorf of an Inquiry iyito Precognitive Dreams 19U\nlong pieces and is split in places. I lift up the separate pieces one\nby one.\" The subject comments that on 12 June \" I crossed a\nbridge over a small creek. It was very roughly made of long and\nrather thin pieces of timber. It had a handrail on each side. The\nbridge itself was Hke the handrail in the dream. The different pieces\nfitted very badly and moved under my feet as the rail in the dream\ndid when I hfted the various pieces. Shortly after crossing the\nbridge I saw a number of small boys bathing in the river.\"\n(16) In the same dream the subject is going to a concert at BaUiol\nand wonders what to wear. She thinks she must put on a big coat\nif she wears a thin dress, as it is very cold. The subject writes :\n\" On June 12th, my friend [G. H. J.] discussed with me what she\nshould wear for a concert. She said that earlier in the Term she\nhad always worn a fur coat to go to the Balliol concerts as it had\nbeen so cold.\" Corroborated by G. H. J.\n(17) In the same dream Subject Oil sees a lady moving a table\nand chair so that they stand in the sunlight. The subject writes :\n\" On June r2th I washed my hair and wished to sit in the sun to\ndry it. I moved first my table so that I could sit by it in the sun\nand then took a low chair over to the window and sat in it in a\npatch of sunlight.\"\n(18-21) occur in the records of Subject 014.\n(18) In his third record (24-25 May 1932) this subject refers to a\n\" small curtained cell \" connected with phrenology. Six weeks later\nthe subject went into a palmist's tent which was \" an almost exact\nreplica \" of the dream cell. This however is not described in the\nrecord.\n(19) Later in the same dream this subject describes a room, a\nfew of the details of which he thinks were confirmed about three\nmonths later. In view of the long interval and the small degree\nof concordance it is unnecessary to go into details.\n(20) The same remark apphes to a description in this subject's\nfifth record (5-6 June 1932) in which a canoe with a canvas cover is\ndescribed, and which the subject thinks was partly confirmed about\ntwo and a half months later.\n(21) In his sixth record (16-17 June 1932) Subject 014 writes :\n\" Dream I was saihng alone in a small boat constructed out of a num-\nber of cartwheels cut in half, with planks nailed along and tarred.\nWhen I stood up the boat upset and I found myself swimming in\nrather muddy water\u2014 in a bathing dress.\" On 14 July 1932, nearly\na month later, this subject writes to say that he had seen an object\n\f200 Theodore Besterman [PAKT\n\" precisely the same as that seen in my dream.\" He encloses the\nfollowing corroboration from the Vicar of C. : \"I \"witness having\nobserved\u2014in company with subject 014\u2014a curious object of the\nshape drawn below\u2014being carried by a man up the hill outside the\nvicarage, C, on Thursday July 14th at 4.10 p.m. (3 half circles of\nwood joined together with slats of wood).\"\n(22-25) occur in the records of Subject 015.\n(22) In his first record (19-20 May 1932) this subject dreamed of\na person lecturing, which was of course confirmed the next dav.\n(23) In his third record (23-24 May 1932) he writes of a conver-\nsation about the Oxford Group. This was confirmed the next day.\nCorroborated.\n(24) In his fifth record (27-28 May 1932) the subject dreamed that\nthe furniture in his rooms had been moved. The next morning he\nmentioned this dream to the friend with whom he shares his rooms.\nLater in the day he found that the table in his room had been moved.\nCorroborated.\n_\n(25) In his sixth record (29-30 May 1932) 015 dreamed of an open-\nair meeting of the Oxford Group movement led by the Vicar of\nSt Aldates. Ten days later he saw the vicar of St Aldates leading an\nopen-air meeting not connected with the Oxford Group movement.\n(26) In his first record (19-20 May 1932) Subject 017 dreams of\na stout lady arriving in a grey Austin 7. On the following day he\nheard that some relations of a friend had arrived in Oxford in a\nblue Austin 7.\n(27-29) occur in the records of Subject 018.\n(27) In his first record this subject describes a dream in which\nhe realised with a feeling of frustration that he was late for an\nengagement. He vaguely remembers a sequel in which he was\napologising to his brother for the error. The following day he\nsuddenly remembered with the same feeling that he was late for a\nmeeting of a discussion group, to which he made an apology which\nhe had been meditating for the past week. Corroborated.\n(28) In his third record this subject describes a dream generally\nconnected with the Oxford Group movement. This was vaguely\nconfirmed the next day.\n(29) In his fourth record 018 writes, among other things, of \" two\nscreen vamps.\" The following day he had a conversation on the\nsubject of impurity and moral delinquencies.\n(30) In his first record Subject 020 describes a scene which was\nconfirmed by something he saw the following day in a film. Unfor-\n\f130] Report of an Inquiry into Precognitive Dreams 201\ntunately the main point in the incident was not included in the\nrecord, so that it is not necessary to go into details.\n(31) The same subject writes to say that a number of minor points\nin his fourth record (24-25 May 1932) were afterwards confirmed.\n'Ue of these points is worth describing in detail.\n(32) Subject 021 in his second record (20-21 May 1932) writes of\na sports ground with tiers of seats. He sends a cutting from the\nSuv^' Pictorial of 22 May, a photograph of the interior of the\nAlbert Hall while in use for a gymnastic display.\n(33) In his second record (21-22 May 1932) Subject 022 dreamed\nof a \" schoolgirl of about 16, with long hair.\" The following day\nhe saw such a girl, though he does not know her age nor whether\nshe is a schoolgirl.\nOf these 33 cases it is clear that 21 (Nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 16,\n17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33) must be ruled out as\nof no value. Of the remaining twelve cases ten may be described\nas poor or indifferent (Nos. 1, 4, 8, 9, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24, 25,) and two\nas good (Nos. 10 and 11). It will probably be agreed, however, that\nneither of these cases is \" conclusive.\" No. 10 has ample detail and\nwas confirmed within a day, but not with great exactness. No. 11\nhas little detail and was confirmed only in a month in general and\nin two months so far as the subject is concerned, since she first read\nthe book at the beginning of August. Thus, out of the 148 dreams of\nthe Oxford Group we have a total of 12 apparent precognitions (just\nover 8%), including two good ones, but no \" conclusive \" instance.\n4. The Experiment : Third Series.\nAt the same time as the second series was begun, I invited Mr\nDunne to send in a similar series of records himself, in view of the\npossibility that the successes recorded in his book might have been\ndue to some special \" faculty \" in himself. Mr Dunne pointed out\nthat it was a long time since the precognitive dreams recorded in\nhis book occurred and that there was clearly no guarantee that he\nwould be able to repeat those results. Nevertheless he agreed to\nmake the attempt. Unfortunately he found that he now had con-\nsiderable difficulty in remembering his dreams, and accordingly the\nseventeen excellent and detailed records he sent in were spread over\na considerable period, 16 May to 30 September 1932.\nMr Dunne put forward five cases of precognition, and I will quote\nthese in full in his own words.\n(1) In his second record (22-23 May 1932) Mr Dunne wrote :\n\" A\nbishop had written to me suggesting that my wife and I be recon-\nfirmed. Had forgotten to reply. Met him some ten days later. He\ntackled me on the subject. We talked, both leaning on the window-\nsill of a window looking over gardenlike scene. I seemed sometimes\n\f202 Theodore Bestennan [part\nto be leaning on a table in the window and sometimes on the sill\nitself. I apologised for not having replied. He wanted me to accept\nhis offer at once as he would only be there for another ten days.\nI tried to draw a red herring.\"\nMr Dunne writes that one to four days later he \" was asked to\ntea to meet the Bishop who married me over four years ago. Had\nnot seen or heard or spoken of him for two years. It is a joke\nbetween my wife and myself that we would like to have our wedding\nover again, and I should never have missed saying that to the\nBishop had I met him. I accepted the invitation, but illness pre-\nvented me from going.\"\n(2) In his fifth record (28-29 May 1932) Mr Dunne writes :\n\" Was\nstanding on a high terrace or roof-garden. A new Dunne-type aero-\nplane appeared in the sky, very noisy and climbing at a tremendous\nrate. It had the usual arrowhead shape, but almost everything was\nplaced above the wings instead of, as usual, below them. The effect\nwas as if it were flying upside down. It had been built by a foreigner.\nWas told that it was one of a number of aeroplanes which were out\nsearching for a missing airship.\"\nMr Dunne writes :\n\" The '\nDunne '\naeroplanes were the first of\nthe tail-less machines, and came to an end about 1916. In about\n1924 this type was revived by Lieutenant Hill under the name of\nthe '\nPterodactyl,' built from my patents and with my consent and\nassistance. At the time of the dream I knew of only two machines\nof this type : the '\nPterodactyl '\nand one built by a German. On\nJune 18th I saw in a hairdresser's shop a picture of, apparently, a\nnew '\nPterodactyl '\n(cutting enclosed), and in the '\nMorning Post\n'\nof June 24th I read that this machine, piloted by Lieutenant Stain-\nforth (who holds the world's speed record) was going to join with\nothers in a '\nballoon stunt ' at Hendon. I enclose several press cut-\ntings referring to this incident, from which it will be seen that Stain-\nforth beat the other craft engaged and shot down the monster-\nshaped balloons. One cuttmg says that he amazed the crowd by\nhis evolutions around the monsters as he brought them down. Such\n'\nevolutions '\nwould naturally suggest '\nlooping,' the commonest\nfeature of aerial fighting, but a feat which the old-time '\nDunnes\n'\nwere unable to accomplish, and so of particular interest in any dream\nof a '\nDunne.' The speed was also of interest, for the old '\nDunnes\n'\nwere slow. The noisiness remarked in the dream might be accounted\nfor by the revolver shots.\"\n(3) In his eleventh record (21-22 June 1932) Mr Dunne wrote\nbriefly all that he \" could recall from a long series of dreams \" :\n\" My [relative] in America had broken his leg (later, his neck), by\nwalking on a ledge which had given way.\"\nMr Dunne writes :\n\" On the morning of Jime 25th I received a\n\f130] Report of an Inquiry into Precognitive Dreams 203\ncopy of a letter from the British Consul at Los Angeles stating that\nmy [relative] in America was stranded penniless in that town and\nwould probably be deported unless funds for his maintenance were\nforthcoming. 1 spent most of the day writing letters about this\naffair. In the evening I read in a '\nshocker '\n{Tale of Two Murders,\nby H. C. Asterley, published by Jarrolds) of a man who had fallen\nfrom an ornamental ledge which ran along the side of a house. The\nbook describes him (page 62) as '\nlying there on the pathway with\nhis left leg twisted up under his body in a sickening, horrible manner,'\nbut the reader is left in doubt as to whether the man is dead. If he\nwere, it would mean that the hero's best friend, who caused the fall,\nhad committed a murder\u2014which I considered a very unlikely\ndevelopment. However, on the next page, it is stated that some-\none approaches the man and finds that he is, in fact, dead.\n\" At first (as usual) I regarded this as a minor result, but on\nthinking it over, it seems to me to be a perfect example of a blend\nbetween two experiences, both future. I enclose the copy I received of\nthe Consul's letter, together with the dated letter of the sender of this.\n\"\n(4) In his twelfth record (22-23 June 1932) Mr Dunne writes :\n\" Was on a road in a town\u2014a road at a higher level than the houses\non one side\u2014fifty feet to seventy feet higher. Was looking down\non a small cinema. The content's bill over the door showed that a\nfilm based on a story by Owen Wister was being shown. This story\nwas not '\nThe Virginian '\nbut was a similar cowboy story about one\nof the Virginian's friends. The name Evans came into the title.\"\nMr Dunne writes : \"On June 26th Mr Fitzgerald of Wroxton\ncame to lunch. He began talking about revolver shooting, and, to\nillustrate a point, asked me if I had seen the film of Owen Wister's\nbook '\nThe Virginian.' I cannot recall that I had ever heard of such\na film having been made, though I have a dim notion of something\nconnected with that subject having occurred at Hastings last wmter.\nFilms are rarely spoken-of in this house.\"\n(5) In his fifteenth record (17-18 July 1932) Mr Dunne wrote :\n\" Was in a building full of small school dormitories. It had four\nfloors, with a separate staircase to each floor. The bedsteads were\nof iron. I began to wonder how I would get out if there was a fire,\nand contrived some plan which involved jumping from bed to bed.\nPresently there either was a fire from which I was escaping, or else\nI was rehearsing my planned escape.\n\" The scene got mixed up with a school rag in which someone\nwas using a long wooden bench as a weapon.\n\" Was outside the school looking at a small oblong building ol\ndull gray brick. It bordered a deep gully on the right as I faced it.\nThe gully was crossed by a bridge on my right. There was a noise\nof trains. The building had been erected as a memorial of someone\nM\n\f204 Theodore Besterman [part 130]\nand had an inscription (small) on the gidly side to that effect.\nThought the inscription was to the memory of Chevasse. {N.B.\u2014\nThat seems to be a clear reference to the past, as I saw a memorial\npulpit unveiled to Chevasse, lately).\"\nMr Dunne writes :\n\" Visited the '\nBluecoat School ' (Christ's\nHospital) at Horsham that day [18 July]. Saw the bridge on my\nright crossing the gully at Guildford, en route. Was lodged in the\nsmall house of dull grey brick (but with a red tiled roof). It was\nat the bottom of another gully and beside another bridge crossing\nthis, but on the wrong side. A railway line passed twenty yards\nfrom the door ; but I was told that no trains ran at night so that\nI would not be disturbed. This was a mistake. Trains thundered\nby apparently every half hour during the night and woke me re-\npeatedly.\"\nOf these five cases it will probably be agreed that number 5 must\nbe rejected as showing no evidence of precognition, and that the\nremaining four eases offer fair or moderate jyrhna facie cases for\nprecognition.\n5. Conclusion.\nWe may now sum up these three series as follows : forty-three\nsubjects sent in 430 records of dreams, an average of ten each.\nSince I was endeavouring to test the claim that precognitive dream\nexperiences are shared by everybody, there can be no objection to\ntreating the entire body of dreams received as a whole for statistical\npurposes, even though a number of the subjects did not send in\nthe full complement of dreams. These forty-three subjects, then,\nput forward forty-five events in their dreams as being possibly pre-\ncognitive, or an average of just over one apiece. Of these forty-five\ncases ]; regard eighteen as having a frima facie case, of which two\nhave a good case. I do not regard any of these eighteen cases as\ncapable of being regarded as conclusive instances of precognition.\nThese figures are of course merely a personal estimate. With\n\" free \" material such as this, where one has no certain basis for\nstatistical evaluation, there must always be room for difference of\no])inion. I believe, however, that my estimate will not be seriously\ncontested in a more optimistic direction.\nAt the same time some points of interest have been brought out\nand a suggestive line for future research has been emphasised. I\nmust express my hearty thanks to all the subjects, and particularly\nthe Oxford Group, on whom we had no claim, for the time and\ntrouble they took in recording their dreams for the purpose of this\nexperiment. We are indebted also to Mr H. H. Price for the trouble\nand care he took in collecting and forwarding the dreams of the\nOxford Group.\n\fVISIONS AND APPARITIONS COLLECTIVELY\n\u2014 AND RECIPROCALLY PERCEIVED\n.... ,, : .!: !\n: , ,\nBy Hornell Hart and Ella B. Hart :\nApparitions are of central interest in connection with certain\nproblems of psychical research. Normally, likenesses of persons\nappear in memories, in dreams, and in imaginative experiences in\ngeneral. Less ordinarily they appear in crystal visions, hypnotically\ninduced hallucinations, and in perception of apparitions. In the\npresent study we have undertaken the collection of the best evi-\ndenced available cases of certain crucial types. All authenticated\ninstances in which two or more individuals have seen the same\napparition at the same time, have been sought for. In addition,\nsearch has been made for the best-proved cases of reciprocal dreams,\nof cases where an apparition of a hving person has coincided with\na parallel dream by the appearer, and of cases where apparitions\nhave resulted from deUberate attempts at \" projection \" by the\nappearer. From among the cases located, all those have been elimi-\nnated where it has seemed to us that such hypotheses as mistaken\nidentity, normal suggestion, or sleep-walking might be advanced\nwith any plausibility. Reports of professional mediumistic seances\nhave not been included in this study.\nThe evidential standards set for inclusion in this study are as\nfollows. In cases accepted as of primary evidential value, the\naccounts must have been written out by two or more of the per-\ncipients, or must have been approved in writing by both of them,\nwithin one year of the date of the occurrence. The accounts must\ncontain internal evidence that each percipient had a clearly in-\ndependent experience of the phenomenon, and did not merely\nendorse or assent to an experience alleged by another percipient.\nCases conforming to these primary standards are given numbers\npreceded by the letter p. In addition to these, however, secondary\nexamples will be cited, with numbers preceded by the letter s.\nAmong evidential considerations to be taken into account in con-\nsidering the value of these additional cases are the number and\nknown character of witnesses, the previous existence of records\nwritten at or near the time of the occurrence, but which were not\navailable to the investigator reporting the case, and the testimony\nof persons to whom the case was reported immediately after the\noccurrence, particularly when the report was made in reciprocal\ncases before the verifying information was received by the percipient.\nBesides the primary and secondary cases, a number of tertiary\n205\n\f206 Horn ell Hart and Ella B. Hart [part\nevidential quality have been included, and designated by tbe letter\nt. This group includes in general all cases cited in which the in-\ndependent testimony of two or more percipients was not secured.\nThe cases have been collected by search through the Proceedings\nand Journal of both the S.P.R. and the American S.P.R. ; Phantasms\nof the Living ; Human Persoyiality and its Survival of Bodily Death,\nby F. W. H. Myers ; Noted Witnesses for Psychic Occurrences, 1928,\nand Human Experiences, 1931, both by Walter Franklin Prince,\nand other books as noted.\nIn studying these cases, facts have been sought bearing on the\nanswers to the following questions. (1) How well authenticated\nare cases where two or more persons have perceived the same\napparition (or dream-shape of a person) imder conditions not\nfavourable to the hypothesis that one of the percipients may have\ninduced the experiences in the others by normal suggestion ? (2)\nHow closely identical have the experiences of the different per-\ncipients been ? (3) In what respects have the apparitions con-\nformed, or failed to conform, to the appearance of normal persons ?\n(4) To what extent have the apparitions and the dream-shapes of\npersons here involved been self-conscious entities, and to what\nextent have they been mere simulacra ? (5) In what respects have\nthe apparitions fitted themselves into the space-time environment,\nand in what ways have they transcended the ordinary laws of matter,\nspace and time ? (6) At how great distances from each other have\nthe agents and the percipients been when reciprocal or coincidental\napparitions have occurred ? (7) What emotional and intellectual\nlinkages have been apparent among the percipient, the appearer,\nthe emotional crises or intellectual focuses of either, and the place\nof appearance ? (8) What evidence have collectively perceived\napparitions of the dead given as to whether they represented sur-\nviving personalities ?\nInstead of attempting to present the evidence bearing upon each\nof these questions separately, clarity will be served by simimarising\nall the authenticated cases found, of each of several general types,\nand then discussing their interpretation.^\nCollective Crystal Visions and Allied Phenomena\nLike reciprocal dreams, and like collective perceptions of apparitions,\ncollective crystal visions usually involve the perception of persons\nnot present in the ordinary space-time way. Unlike dreams, in\ncrystal visions the focus of the observer's consciousness seems to be\noutside the scene rather than in the midst of it. And unlike the\n1 Among previous discussions of collective cases the following may be\nmentioned Phantasms of the Living, ii. 168-70 ; F. W. H. Myers, Human\nPersonality, ii. 260-5.\n\f130] Visions and Apparitions 207\nperception of apparitions, the figures seen in crystal visions seem\nto be in an environment of their own, not in the surroundings of the\npercipient. The first two cases below are collective crystal visions\nproper.\np 1. In or about 1897 a Miss Rose called on a Miss Angus, to ask\nthe latter to look in a crystal for her. The two looked in the crystal\nalternately. Both saw a bed, with a man lying on it, apparently\ndead, and a lady in black sitting beside it, or at least present in the\nroom. The case was reported to Andrew Lang by Miss Angus\nwithin a day or two of its occurrence, and it was then confirmed to\nhim verbally by Miss Rose. In December, 1897, each of the ladies\nsubmitted an independent written account. The accounts disagree\nas to which looked in the crystal first. It is clear that they announced\nto each other what they saw, so that the influence of verbal sug-\ngestion cannot be ruled out.^\np2. On 24 June 1901, Miss B. H. Grieve and Miss Catherine\nGoad (who were attending college in Worcestershire) both looked\ninto the same crystal ball at the same time. Both of them saw\npyramids\u2014a large one in front, and two or more behind ;\nboth saw\na train of camels passing from left to right ; both saw that one or\nmore of the camels carried a rider, while others were led ; both\nnoted that the train disappeared behind the pyramid.\nIndependent written accounts from the percipients were received\non 11 October 1901. Upon inquiry. Miss Grieve declared that each\nof the percipients had written down descriptions of the vision as it\noccurred, and that they did not speak while the vision lasted.\n^\nIn addition to these two primary cases is the following tertiary\none :\nt 3. Sometime previous to 1871, Miss A. Goodrich-Freer and a\nfriend looked together into a crystal and both saw an improbable\nscene, which, when they returned home they found to have been\nveridical.^\nThe above three cases all involve visions seen in crystals. In the\nfollowing cases crystal balls were not employed, but the visions\nwere referred to special gazing places, and were not regarded as\nbeing in the normal environment. They are therefore included here\nwith the crystal visions.\ns 4. On 5 April 1873, Captain Towns died in N.S. Wales. About\nsix weeks after his death, his wife, accompanied by a Miss Berthon,\nsaw the image of the dead man apparently reflected in the polished\nsurface of a wardrobe. Only the head, shoulders and part of the\n1 Andrew Lang, The Making of Religion (1900), pp. 90-2.\n2 Jowrw. ,S.P.i?. (1901-2), X. 134-6.\n3 Theodore Besterman, Crystal-Gazing (1924), p. 124; from A. Goodrich-\nFreer, Essays in Psychical Research (1899), pp. 127-8.\n\f208 Hornell Hart avd Ella B. Hart [part\narms were showing. The face appeared wan and pale, as before his\ndeath, and he wore a grey flannel jacket, in which he had been\naccustomed to sleep. No portrait was present from which this\ncoiUd have been a reflection. Six persons, closely connected with\nthe deceased, then came or were called in succession into the room,\nand each without suggestion from the others, recognised the image\nas that of Captain Towns. Finally it faded gradually away.\nAn account of this case, dated 3 December 1885, was signed by\ntwo of the percipients.^\np 5. In May 1904, in Switzerland, four ladies sat in front of a\nmirror in company with a friend who was a non-professional medium.\nThe four percipients were Mrs A., her sister Mrs P., her daughter,\nMiss A., and a Mrs H. All four of them saw in the mirror a vision\nof the father of Mrs A. and Mrs P. The three who were acquainted\nwith him recognised him ; the other notes that the vision was\nrecognised by the others. The face of the vision formed over the\nreflection of the medium, according to the accounts of all but Mrs\nH. ; she saw it in a corner of the mirror, apart from the medium.\nMiss A. says that the apparition smiled and nodded at them when\nit was recognised. Mrs A., Mrs P., and Miss A. all saw a vision of\nthe sister of the two married women who had died three months\nbefore. Mrs A. says that she saw this face two or three times,\nsmiling and looking intently at the percipients. Two other ap-\nparitions are mentioned as having been seen by one or two of the\npercipients.\nThe last vision was more elaborate. Three percipients agree\nthat they saw a hall, opening into a room, or a bay window, brilliantly\nlighted ; the fourth refers to it as a ballroom brilliantly lighted.\nAll saw people moving about. Mrs P. and Mrs H. were unable to\nrecognise any of these, but both Mrs A. and Miss A. recognised the\nfigure of Mrs A. hejself, and of her son E., who was at that time in\nLondon.\nAll four percipients submitted written accounts before the end\nof the year.-\nCollectively Perceived Apparitions of Living\nPersons\nIn the crystal vision cases, perceptions of living and of dead persons\nhave been grouped together. The cases of collectively perceived\napparitions will be found in four groups : those of persons ascer-\ntained to have been living at the time of the apparition ; those of\npersons ascertained to have been at or near the point of death ;\n^ F.

Mouat of Barnsbury, and his\nfriend, Mr R., both saw the apparition of a Rev. Mr H., who, at\nthe time, was in another part of the town. Both of them saw him\nin the same part of the room ; both noted the melancholy look on\nhis face ;\nboth assumed that he was simply his ordinary self. But\nafter Mr R. had left, while Mr Mouat was looking at the apparition,\na clerk mentioned Mr H.'s name, whereupon the figure disappeared\nin a second. The clerk then denied that Mr H. had been in the\noffice that day. This was later confirmed by Mr H.\nIt is stated that Mr Mouat wrote down his account of this\ncase \" soon after the occurrence,\" and that Mr R. supplied to the\nS.P.R. committee independent and precise corroboration of the facts\nstated.^\nWhile the above and case s 55 are the only reports of collectively\nperceived apparitions of persons known to be living which fulfil\neven the secondary standards of evidence, a number of tertiary\ncases have been reported. These are presented in approximately\nchronological order.\nt 7. One evening, in or about the year 1858, in Montserrat, West\nIndies, the apparition of Mr George Habershon was seen by Mrs\nAnnie Sturge and another young lady after he had left the house\nand the door had been locked. At about the time the apparition\nwas seen he had been arguing with himself whether to go back to\nthe house.\nMrs Sturge wrote the account in 1884, with indirect confirmation\nfrom Mrs Minnie Semper.\n^\nt 8. Mrs Sarah Jane Hall stated in writing in 1883 that in 1863\nher own apparition was seen by herself, her husband, and two other\npeople.^\nt9. In Cairo, in 1864, Mrs E. H. Elgee and a young woman\nsleeping in the same room each independently at the same time saw\nthe apparition of an old friend of Mrs Elgee's, who at that time was\nin England. Every detail of the figure's dress was noted. The\napparition pointed at Mrs Elgee's companion, who appeared terror-\nstricken, and then retreated until it seemed to sink through a\nclosed door which was blocked by a settee. The companion next\nday described the apparition as Mrs Elgee had seen it.\nFour years later, the appearer was encountered, and recalled\nthat he was wishing intensely to talk with her at the tune she saw\nhis apparition. The account was written by Mrs Elgee in 1885.*\n1 10. Mr R. P. Roberts, of Manchester, England, reported in\n1 Phantasms of the Living, ii. 211-12 ; Proc. S.P.R.

On 11 July 1879, fifty miles south of Indianapolis, Indiana,\nSamuel S. Falkinburg and his five-year-old son, Arthur, both saw\nthe face of Falkinburg's father between them and the joists of the\nceiling. Within a few minutes of the time of this vision, the father\ndied suddenly in IndianapoHs, just after having been talking of his\nson and grandson. Falkinburg submitted a signed statement in\n1884, supported by an independent signed statement from his wife,\nwho had been present and had heard her son's exclamation at seeing\nhis grandfather's face.^\nHere, again, less adequately evidenced cases are more numerous.\nt 12. About 1840, according to a statement submitted by Mr C.\nColchester of Herts about 1882, he and his brother (then aged about\nsix and five years) saw an apparition of their grandmother in Mon-\ntreal, C'anada, on the same evening when she died in England. They\nwere not told until years later of the fact that their mother also had\nseen an apj^arition of the grandmother on that same evening.^\n1 13. On IG April 1845, Phillip Weld, nephew of Cardinal Weld,\nwas drowned in Hertfordshire. At the very hour when this fatal\naccident occurred, the boy's father and sister both saw an apparition\nof Phillip, accompanied by two other figures, one of which was later\nidentified from a picture as St Stanislaus Kostka. The father\nobserved that the apparition of his son was transparent.\nAn account of this case was written about 1868 by the sister.\nA quite independent account, derived from the man who broke the\nnews of the boy's death to the father, was written out in 1872, and\nagrees in essential points.*\nt 14.

During a midday dinner in 1884, a mother and daughter,\nMrs Greifenberg and Mrs Erni-Greifenberg both saw a large white\nAngora cat with green eyes under the table. The cat marched round\nthe table, went noiselessly out the door and half-way down a passage,\nturned, stared at the two women, and then dissolved away under\ntheir eyes. The same apparitional cat went through the same\nperformance a year later in Leipzig.\nA statement written by the daughter and signed by both per-\ncipients was filed in 1890.\"^\np 16. On 16 May 1888, Miss A. Goodrich-Freer, who had published\na report of some systematic experiments in crystal vision in the\nProceedings, and who had been making some systematic experiments\nin telepathy, was present at an evening entertainment with Miss\nH. Late in the evening Miss H. was seized with faintness. Miss\nGoodrich-Freer followed her into another room, and was soon seated\non the floor, holding her unconscious head on her knee. After some\nminutes of unconsciousness. Miss H. seized her hand and uttered a\nsudden exclamation. Following the direction of her eyes. Miss\nGoodrich-Freer saw a figure, standing a few feet distant, directly\nfacing them and looking down at H. The figure was not in evening\ndress, as all the guests at the entertainment were. The vision lasted\nonly a moment.\nNothing was said at the time by either Miss H. or Miss Goodrich-\nFreer, and the subject was not even alluded to until some months\nlater. On 9 November following, Miss H., without any remark,\nhanded to Miss Goodrich-Freer a portrait of the subject of the vision.\nMiss Goodrich-Freer immediately exclaimed, Just so, the broad\nforehead.\" Miss H. wondered what this meant, but said nothing.\nSome few weeks later Miss H. narrated her experience of 16 May\nto Mr Myers, and then Miss Goodrich-Freer, in the hearing of Miss\nH., described the apparition, and said :\n\" The broad forehead\nespecially struck me.\" Each percipient drew independently a plan\n1 Plmntasms of the Living, ii. 615-6. 2 p^^c, S.P.R.

On 19 April 1890, in Manchester, England, Mr and Mrs\nBarber were approaching their own house at about sunset, while\nthe light was still good. When they were about six yards from the\ngate, Mr Barber saw a woman pass through it and walk up the path\nto the house. Mrs Barber saw the figure when it was about a yard\ninside the gate. Almost simultaneously they exclaimed :\n\" Who\nis that ?\n\" The figure appeared entirely natural, commonplace and\nsubstantial. Mrs Barber observed that the woman had on a grey\ndress ; Mr Barber noted a plaid shawl and a grey-black bonnet\nwith a bit of colour in it. The figure moved quietly up the walk\nand then up the two steps to the door. Mr Barber hurried forward\nwith his latchkey, but when he was within four yards, the apparition\ndisappeared through the locked door before their eyes. Mr Barber\nthen unlocked and opened the door, and they made a careful search\nof the house (for which the natural daylight was still sufficient).\nNothing could be found. The figure was not recognised.\nIndependent written accounts were submitted by Mrs and Mr\nBarber on 21 and 30 January 1891, and F. W. H. Myers interviewed\nthem on 1 August 1891.^\ns 18. In, or about, 1892, Lady B. and her daughter were sleeping\nin the same room in London. In the middle of the night both ladies\nsuddenly started up wide awake, and saw a female figure in a white\ngarment with dark curly hair hanging down the back. The figure\nwas standing in front of the fireplace, over which was a mirror.\nLady B. saw the face in quarter profile, the head intercepting its\nown reflection in the mirror. Miss B. saw the back of the figure\nand its long dark hair ; the face was not visible directly, but was\nclearly seen reflected in the mirror. Both percipients immediately\nsprang out of bed to the doors, which were found locked. On\nturning round again, the figure had disappeared.\nBoth of these percipients, and a cousin, stated that when sleeping\nin a room adjoining the one just mentioned they repeatedly heard\nfootsteps as of a person approaching the door, the door handle\nwould be turned or shaken, and the footsteps would proceed up-\nstairs. Persistent investigation could find no normal explanation\nfor these noises.\n1 Proc. S.P.R. (1889-90), vi. 370-1.\n^Jmirtt. S.P.R. (1893-4), vi. 22-5 ; Proc. S.P.R.

On the night of 1 November 1889, between 9.30 and 10 p.m.,\nthree Du Cane sisters all saw the apparition of a man. They had\nentered their bedroom and were searching for matches to light the\ngas when all three of them saw the figm'e and cried out at the same\nmoment. Louisa Du Cane described the appearance as that of a\nyoung man, of middle height, dressed in dark clothes and wearing\na peaked hat. His face was very pale, and his eyes downcast as\nthough deep in thought. He had a dark moustache.^ Although\nthe room was too dark for the sisters to see each others' faces, that\nof the apparition was slightly luminous, so that the features could\nbe distinguished clearly. Louisa's two sisters first caught sight of\nthe apparition in a mirror, but it glided within a few inches of them\nand suddenly vanished. A fourth sister had her face turned away\nand did not see the apparition, but all four agree that they distinctly\nfelt a cold air which seemed to accompany it. The figure was not\nrecognised.\nLouisa wrote an account of this experience on 31 July 1891,\nwhich the other three sisters signed. Mrs Sidgwick later called on\nthem to investigate the case.^\np20. In August 1891, Agnes McCaskill and her cousin. Miss\nL. v., were sleeping in a room in Cassel, Germany. The room was\nsupposed to be haunted by an old German knight who had hanged\nhimself there, and whose portrait in stained glass formed one of the\nwindows. The apparition was supposed to come once in ten years,\nand this night was supposed to be one of the decaimiversaries. At,\nor a little after midnight, Miss V. saw a strange light appear, and\nthen there seemed to emerge from the wall or the stained window\na very tall figure, completely draped in white, with no part of the\nface exposed except green glittering eyes. Miss V. screamed, and\nMiss McCaskiU turned and saw the figure. The apparition was\nclearly defined, but the wallpaper and other objects could be seen\nthrough it. It moved over to Miss McCaskill's bed, making no\nsound on the polished floor. As it came close to her bed she seized\nit. She seemed to take hold of something soft, fike flimsy drapery,\nbut whatever it was seemed dragged from her and the thing\nliterally sank into the floor, about an arm's length from the bed.\nBoth percipients submitted written accounts in July 1892.\nInvestigation by Miss Johnson seems to support the written accounts\nin ruling out the possibility that some human being other than the\npercipients could have been in the room.^\n^ Journ. iS.P.B. {ISmA), Yi.

On 7 May 1892, about quarter to six in the afternoon, near\nSt. Boswells, England, Miss Louisa Scott was walking along a road\nbetween two very thick hedges, with wide fields on either side.\nShe saw advancing towards her a tall man, dressed in a long black\ncoat, whom she took to be a clergyman. She looked away for a\nmoment, and on looking back was greatly surprised to find that he\nhad gone from sight. There was no place for him to have gone, and\nshe stood for several minutes looking backwards and forwards into\nthe fields and in all directions. She then was surprised to see her\nsister, Miss M. W. Scott, turn the corner a little higher up the road\nand commence running down a little hill which was there. Almost\nimmediately she came to a sudden halt, and Louisa saw her begin\nsearching around, as she herself had done. Then she approached\nLouisa and said : Where on earth is that man who was standing\nonly about ten feet from you ?\n\"\nIt developed that Miss M. E. Scott had started to run, because\nshe was a little late, but had perceived a tall man dressed in black\nwalking at a moderate pace, and not wishing to run past him, had\nstopped. The figure turned the corner of the road, but was still\ndistinctly defined between the hedges. Then, while she was looking\ndirectly at him, he instantly vanished. It will be noted that the\nsisters saw the figure successively, not simultaneously.\nToward the end of July, at about the same hour, Miss M. E. Scott\nwas traversing the same spot with another sister. The former\nobserved a dark figure approaching, and exclaimed :\n\" Oh, I do\nbelieve that is our man. I won't remove my eyes from him !\n\"\nShe saw the entire figure. It was dressed wholly in black garments,\nconsisting of a long coat, gaiters and knee-breeches. The legs were\nvery thin. Round the throat was a wide white cravat ; on the head\nwas a low-crowned hat. The face, of which only the profile was\nseen, was exceedingly thin and deadly pale. The sister saw only\nthe head and to below the shoulders. Both kept their eyes on the\napparition until it seemed to fade away towards the bank on the\nright side of the road. \" Frantic \" search failed to discover any sign\nof the vanished figure.\nOn 12 June 1893, Miss M. E. Scott saw it again, but this time she\nwas alone. Thinking at first that the figure was a woman she wanted\nto see, she hurried after it. Finding that it was the now familiar\napparition, she pursued it boldly, but although the man appeared\nto be walking slowly she could get no closer than within a few yards,\nfor he seemed to float or skim away. Presently he stopped, turned\nand gazed at her with a vacant expression. He was dressed as\n\f130] Visions and Apparitions 215\nbefore, with the same pallid features. She noted that he had on\nblack silk stockings and shoe-buckles. Finally, he moved on and\nfaded from view at the usual spot by the hedge on the right.\nMiss Scott reported that at about the same time when she and\nher sisters had their experiences, two girls from the village, stoppmg\nby the road to pick berries, had seen an apparition of exactly the\nsame description gazing intently at them. They fled in terror, but\nlooked back and saw the figure gradually fade away. Accordmg\nto their account his garments were enveloped in a white filmy sheet\nor vapour. Two years previously two boys were reported to have\nhad a similar experience. Legend told of a child murdered close by.\nThe costume of the apparition was found to be that of a clergyman\nof the previous century.\nWritten accounts were submitted within a year of the collective\nexperience by Miss M. E. and Miss Louisa Scott. The other sister\napproved the account in which she was involved, but felt that a\nwritten statement from herself would not be worth while. The\napparition seen on 12 June was reported on 14 June of the same\nyear.^\nIn addition to the foregoing, the following less adequately authen-\nticated cases may be recorded. .\nt 22. In 1853, the Rev. and Mrs D. W. Gwynne, awaking m their\nlocked room, both saw a draped phantom figure passing across the\nfoot of the bed. When the Phantom raised its arm, the mght-light\nwent out, but Mr Gwynne still saw the figure. Mrs Gwynne heard\nits garments rustle.\nThe two percipients each submitted an independent signed\naccount in 1884.^\nt23. In 1857, in Prince Edward Island, two women saw an\napparition of a woman with a check shawl crossed over her bosom,\nholding a baby and surrounded by a supernormal light. In 1858,\na Mrs Pennee and her little daughter saw the same apparition.\nIn 1877 Mrs Pennee was consulted by the bishop of that locality\nrelative to a similar apparition seen by the then occupants. Super-\nnormal shrieks and moans were also heard collectively in the same\nhouse.\nA written account of these phenomena was recorded by Mrs\nPennee in 1884.3\nCollectively Perceived Apparitions of Persons\nKnown to be Dead\nIn case p 5, at least one of the apparitions seen collectively m\nthe mirror was that of a person known to have died previously.

In case t 13, the figure of\nSt Stanislaus (who of course was dead) was alleged to have been\ncollectively perceived with the figure of the boy who was drowned.\nAmong the unrecognised or doubtfully recognised cases (numbers\ns 15 to t 23) it is probable that several represented persons who were\ndead. In the following cases, only apparitions of persons known to\nhave been dead at the time are included.\ns 24. In September 1839, Corporal McQueen and Private Watson\nwere both sleeping in the same quarters in Gibraltar. Watson saw\nsomeone sitting on the foot of McQueen's bed, and called out that\nfact to him. McQueen saw the figure rise and come to the head of\nhis bed. He recognised it as the figure of the wife of a comrade,\ndressed in the grave clothes in which he had laid her in her colfin.\nThe apparition gave him evidential information in proof of her\nidentity and made him promise to warn her husband against an\nevil course he was pursuing. She then gradually faded out.\nThe story of this event became current in the barracks early the\nnext day. The Rev. W. Brown and Captain M. Emmett called\nMcQueen and Watson separately, and cross questioned each strictly,\nand felt satisfied of their sincerity. The captain took notes of the\ninquiry, from which in 1854 he wrote out a full account which was\nsubmitted in evidence.^\ns 25. In March 1846, the wife and two adult daughters of Dr R.,\nin their home in West Philadelphia, Pa., all saw at the same time\nan apparition which they instantly and independently recognised\nas Dr R.'s mother, who had died ten years before. The apparition\nconformed with a promise made by the old lady before her death,\nand coincided with the purchase of a house by her son along lines\nwhich she had advised.\nThat same evening the ladies related their experience to the Rev.\nY. He later told the story to Robert Dale Owen. Mr Owen then\nsecured an account of the story direct from the elder daughter, and\nafterwards secured confirmation from the mother. The direct\naccounts from the percipients tallied exactly with the story as it\nhad been told by Mr Y. Both the mother and the daughter re-\ncollected the precise dress of the apparition and their accounts\nagreed entirely that the apparition had crossed the room, approached\na portrait of Dr R., fingered to look at it, recrossed to the door, and\ninexplicably vanished.\n^\ns 26.

Mr P. later admitted to his\nwife that at the time when the apparition occurred he had been\nintending to take the advice of a man who would certainly have led\nhim to ruin or perhaps to disgrace.\nMrs P. wrote an account of this experience in 1885, which Mr P.\ncertified. Two friends signed a statement that Mrs P. had told\nthem the same narrative some years previously.^\ns 27. On one day in December 1884, three children (all aged\nbetween 10 and 12) twice saw collectively an apparition of a tall\nwoman dressed in black. In July 1885, a sister of two of these\nchildren saw the apparition and recognised it as the dead wife of an\nuncle who was living in the house. She saw the apparition repeatedly\nafterwards, and it was seen individually also by two other members\nof the household. Collective auditory hallucinations were also\nreported. The apparition was generally seen, and the noises heard,\nin or about the uncle's bedroom and dressing-room, and they ceased\nabout February 1886, when he moved away from the house. In\nJuly 1886, when he was again visiting there, the children again\nreported seeing the aunt's apparition, and their mother and grand-\nparents confirmed their accounts.\nWritten statements were secured from all the percipients in or\nabout November 1891. Sir Oliver Lodge interviewed the principal\nwitnesses in October 1891.^\ns 28. In 1886, in Rio de Janeiro, Senhor Ulysses J. C. Cabral\nupon lying down after nursing a friend, had a feeling of unbounded\njoy, and felt as if some one were holding his head and placing\nsomething around it. Donna Fehciana Dias, sitting where she\ncould not see him, in the next room, said : \"I see at your bedside\na spirit child clothed in white. She places on your head a crown of\nroses. She says her name is Deolinda, and she comes to thank you\nfor the kindness and charity with which you behaved to her.\" Only\nthen did Senhor Cabral recall that that day was the anniversary\nof the death of a child named Deolinda, whom he had befriended,\nunbeknown to any of his friends.\nThe above facts were given in a letter by Senhor Cabral to Pro-\nfessor Alfred Alexander, at the request of the latter, in 1892.

Katie Cain, Rose\nKearne and Mrs Corbalis, when interviewed separately, all agreed\non the following facts : a wreath or crown (of \" flowers,\" \" leaves\nand flowers,\"' or \"evergreens\") was on the head; rosary beads\nhung from the hands, which were crossed on the breast or in a\nposition of prayer, or both successively ; the figure wore a robe\nwhich ended at the bottom in clouds. Points mentioned by two,\nbut not all three of the percipients interviewed were as follows :\nThe apparition was seen in profile ; the hair was hanging down the\nback ; the robe was white ; the figure appeared to be solid (or was\nseen as plainly as in life) ; it faded toward the ceiling, or disappeared\nslowly through the ceiling.\nThe newspapers made a great sensation about these events.\nJames H.

At the\nfoot of the bed watched his eldest sister and a friend of his mother.\nAt about 9 o'clock the boy was unconscious. Suddenly the friend\nsaw the mother distinctly, bending over her boy with a look of\nintense love and longing, but not seeming to notice the two watchers.\nThe apparition was in her ordinary dress, as when living, and was\nentirely natural in her appearance. After a minute or two she\nquietly and suddenly was not there.\nThe friend said nothing to the sister at the time. Two days later\nthe boy died. After they had performed the last offices to the body,\nthe sister and friend were standing as they had two days before.\nThe friend said, \" I had a strange experience on Sunday evening\nhere.\" The sister quickly replied :\n\" Yes, mother was here ; I saw\nher.\" (According to a somewhat earlier verbal account she said :\n\" Yes, I know, you saw mother. I saw her too ; she came and kissed\nHughey.\")\nThe above account is based on a written statement by the friend\non 9 December 1903, and signed by both her and the sister. On\n29 November the Rev.

Moore Cosgrave\nnoticed that Traubel's eyes remained riveted on a point some three\nfeet above the bed in a dark portion of the room. Slowly a light\nhaze appeared there, spread until it assumed the form of Walt\nWhitman, standing beside the bed, a rough tweed jacket on, an old\nfelt hat upon his head and his right hand in his pocket. He was\nsmiling down at Traubel. He nodded twice. Traubel said : \"There\nis Walt !\n\" The apparition then passed through the bed toward\nCosgrave. It appeared to touch his hand (which was in his pocket)\nand Cosgrave distinctly felt as tliough he had touched a low electric\ncharge. The apparition then smiled at Traiibel and passed from\nsight.\nCosgrave and Traubel both told this experience, on 6 September,\nto Mrs Flora MacDonald Denison, who made an entry that same day\nin her diary. A copy of this entry was submitted in evidence.\nColonel Cosgrave also made note of the experience. In June 1920\nhe wrote two letters to Walter F.

Mr Salter interviewed them and obtained their\nindependent written and signed accounts. Witnesses, to whom they\ntold their experience immediately after it occurred, confirmed that\nfact. The possibility that some normal person was sitting on the\nstile was regarded by Mr Salter as being ruled out by the fact that\nthe night was too cold for anyone normally to be there.\n^\np 34. In June 1931, a chimney-sweep named Samuel Bull died\nof cancer in Ramsbury, Wilts., England, leaving an aged invalid\nwife and a grandson, James Bull, twenty-one years of age, living\nin the cottage where he died. In August 1931, a married daughter,\nMrs Edwards, came with her five children and her husband to live\nwith them.\nSometime in or after February 1932, Mrs Edwards saw the de-\nceased man ascend stairs and pass through a door, which was shut,\ninto the room in which he died, and in which his widow had been\nlying for some time, but which was then shut up and unused. Almost\nimmediately after Mrs Edwards saw the apparition, James Bull also\nsaw it.\nLater all the members of the family together saw the apparition.\nEven the smallest girl (aged 5 ?) recognised it as \" grandpa Bull.\"\nThe appearances continued at frequent intervals from that time\nuntil about 9 April. Whenever the apparition was seen, all the\npersons present were able to see it.\nThe apparition seemed solid, and twice laid his hand on the brow\nof Mrs Bull. Once she heard him call her \" Jane.\" On one occasion\nthe figure was visible continuously for a period thought to have\nbeen a half-hour. It always appeared to be quite life-like. The\nfeatures were clearly recognised. Mrs Edwards spoke of noting the\nappearance of the hands, with the knuckles seeming to be protruding\nthrough the skin. He was dressed as he usually had been in the\nevenings when he had finished work. A muffler which he was\nwearing was noted as being different in colour from the rest of the\nclothes. Apparently the figure was self-luminous, though contra-\ndictory statements were made on this point. He was seen in day-\nlight as well as by artificial light.\nThe case was originally reported by the local vicar, the Rev. G. H.\nHackett. Through him Lord Selborne and Admiral Hyde Parker\nheard of the case as early as 3 April 1932. Sometime between 7\nand 11 April the vicar, at Admiral Parker's request, visited the\nfamily and put to Mrs Edwards a series of questions covering the\nreported phenomena, which she answered perfectly consistently\nwith earlier statements made by the family. On 14 April, Admiral\nParker, Mr Hackett, Lord Balfour and Mr Piddington called at the\ncottage and interviewed Mrs Edwards and Mrs Bull, who confirmed\n1 Journ. S.P.R. (1928), xxiv. 227-31.\n\f130] Visions and Apparitions 221\nthe information previously supplied. On 31 May 1932, the vicar\nvisited the family and secured the signatures of Mr and Mrs Edwards\nto the statement of facts which he had previously secured from\nthem.^\nThe tertiary cases of this type are as follow :\nt 35. In 1864, Miss Harriet Pearson was on her death bed in the\nhouse in which had died in 1858 her sister Ann, to whom she was\ngreatly attached. On the night before Harriet died, an apparition\nof Ann, wrapped in an old shawl and wearing a wig and an old\nblack cap was seen jointly by three women who were staying in the\nhouse and also by the dying woman. One of the percipients wrote\nan account in 1888. A servant who was present in the house when\nthese events occurred, signed a confirmatory statement.^\nt 36. In 1874, in Silima, Malta, an apparition of Julia H. was seen\non the night following her burial by her thirteen-year-old daughter,\nher husband, and a nurse. The appearance was that of the mother\nas she usually came to see her daughter the last thing at night,\ndressed in a white flannel dressing-gown trimmed with a band of\nscarlet braid, and her long hair loose. The daughter wrote an account\nin 1889, and her stepmother signed a statement that she had heard\nthe same story from the girl's father.^\nt 37. On 1 July 1893, Miss F. Atkinson and a friend saw in a\nchurch an apparition of an old man whose grave they had just\nvisited. They had just been commenting on the failure of the old\nman's executors to put in a memorial window for which he had\nprovided. Miss Atkinson did not believe in apparitions, but she\nsaw the details of his person and costume with complete distinctness,\nand then saw him vanish while her eyes were still directly fixed on\nhim. The friend told Miss Atkinson that the same old man had\nbeen haunting her family in a very persistent and troublesome way.\nThe above facts were stated in letters written by Miss Atkinson on\n5 and 9 November 1893. The friend declined to give an independent\naccount.*\nt 38. In 1906, in Lyons, France, Monsieur Ballet-Gallifet and\nhis wife both saw an apparition of her father. The dog seems to\nhave seen the figure first. The apparition limped as the father had\ndone. A gas light was feebly visible through the figure. Monsieur\nBallet-GalUfet sent his written account of this experience to Flam-\nmarion in 1921. A month later, Madame T. Eougier secured a\nspontaneous verbal statement from him which agreed with the latter,\nand later she also secured verbal confirmation from the wife.^\n1 Journ. S.P.R. (1932), xxvii. 297-303. ^ p^^c.

Dadirrian, who is nearly\nblind, heard footsteps passing along a path around the porch of\nhis home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., at the same moment when\nhis cousin heard nothing but saw an apparition of Mr Dadirrian's\ndead wife along the path where the husband was hearing the foot-\nsteps. Malcolm Bird secured Mr Dadirrian's assent to his account\nof these facts, and a servant testified that the cousin had told the\nexperience in terms corresponding with it.^\nApparitions Corresponding with Deliberate\nAttempts to Produce Them\nThus far in this study, only apparitions perceived by two or more\nother individuals have been included. In these cases, it may be\nsaid that each of the apparitions was seen from the outside by two\nor more people. Cases will now be presented in which given appari-\ntions were perceived both from the outside and the inside\u2014where\nthe apjDearer as well as the percipient was aware of the appearance.\nThis awareness varies greatly in degree ;\nmarginal as well as full-\nfledged cases will be cited.\ns 40. In 1878, a friend of W. Stainton Moses, without informing\nhim in advance, succeeded in projecting an apparition of himself\ninto a chair in Moses's room, some miles distant in London. The\napparition was in ordinary garments ; it remained for some time\nand then faded away. A few weeks later, again without warning,\nthe experimenter produced his apparition. This time Moses ques-\ntioned the figure on a subject which was under warm discussion\nbetween them at the time. In neither of these experiments was\nthe appearer able to recall having been conscious of his own presence\nin Mr Moses's room.\nThe account of this experiment was written down by the appearer\nabout one year after it occurred. The percipient pronounced it\ncorrect four years later, although unable to locate notes which he\nthinlvs were made at the time.^\ns 41. On a certain Sunday evening late in 1881, Mr S. H. Beard\ndetermined \" with the whole force of his being,\" that he would make\nhis spiritual presence perceptible in the front bedroom on the\nsecond floor of a house in London in which slept two ladies of his\nacquaintance. Miss L. S. and Miss E. C. Verity. He was living\nabout three miles away. At that hour the elder of the two ladies\n(aged 25) was much terrified by perceiving Mr Beard distinctly\nstanding by her bedside. When the apparition advanced towards\nher she screamed :\n\" There is S.\" This awakened her sister (aged 11)\nwho also saw the apparition. Both sisters were certain that the\n1 Joimi. Amer. S.P.R.

The gas was burning low, and the phantasmal figure\nis reported to have been seen with far more clearness that a real\nfigure would have been.\nThe elder sister spoke of her experience spontaneously to Mr\nBeard when he called four days later, and before he had mentioned\nhis experiment. He made an entry in an almanac diary within a\nweek or so, and submitted a written account based on it later. The\ntwo sisters who saw the apparition, and a third sister whom they\nawakened to tell about it, all submitted signed statements of their\nexperience about 14 months after the event occurred.^\np 42. On 1 December 1882, at 9.30 p.m., in Southall, England,\nMr S. H. Beard sat in a room alone and endeavoured strongly to\nfix his mind upon the interior of a house at Kew, in which resided\nhis friend. Miss Verity, and her two sisters. He fell into a \" mes-\nmeric sleep \" in which he continued to be conscious, but could not\nmove his limbs. When he had regained his normal state at 10 p.m.,\nhe made a written memorandum of his experiment, including the\nstatement that while concentrating he seemed to himself to be\nactually in the house.\nWhen he went to bed on this same night, he determined that he\nwould make his spiritual presence perceptible to the inmates of the\nfront bedroom of the above-mentioned house.\nThe next day he visited his friends in Kew, and fomid there a\nmarried sister of Miss Verity\u2014Mrs H. L., whom he had met only once\nbefore, two years previously, and then very briefly. During the con-\nversation, although he had asked her no question on such a subject,\nshe told him that she had seen him distinctly twice on the previous\nnight. She had slept in the front bedroom. At about 9.30 she had\nseen him walking before her down a hallway. At about 12 o'clock,\nwhile she was still awake, the door opened, and he entered, walked\nround to the bedside, and there stood with one foot on the ground\nand the other knee resting on a chair. He then took her hair into\nhis hand, after which he took her hand in his, and looked very\nintently into the palm. She said to him :\n\" You need not look at\nthe lines, for I never had any trouble.\" She then awoke her sister,\nand told her of the apparition.\nImmediately upon hearing this account, Mr Beard took from his\npocket the memorandum which he had made the night before, and\nshowed it to some of the persons present. Independent statements\nwere written and signed by Mr Beard, Mrs L., and the sister. Miss\nVerity, who was awakened after the apparition . All the accounts agree\n.\nThey appear to have been submitted within a year of the occur-\nrence, although, as given in the printed account, they are not dated.\n1 Phantasms of the Living, i. 104-6. ^ Id., i. 106-8.\n\f224 Hornell Hart and Ella. B. Hart [part\np 43. On 22 March 1884, Mr S. H. Beard posted a letter to Mr\nEdmund Giirney, stating that he was going to attempt, on that\nnight, to make his (spiritual) presence perceptible at the home of\nhis friend. Miss L. S. Verity. Part of his intention was to produce\nthe impression of touching the percipient's hair. On 2 April he\ncalled upon Miss Verity, and she volunteered the information,\nwithout any suggestion on his part, that on 22 March, at about\n-midnight, while she was quite widely awake, she had seen a most\nvivid and unmistakable apparition of him come towards her and\nstroke her hair. Thereupon she dictated and signed a statement\ndescribing her experience. Her sister also signed a statement to\nthe elfect that she remembered L. S. telling her, before Mr Beard\ncalled, that she had seen Mr Beard and that he had touched her hair.^\nThe Mr S. H. Beard of these experiments was a member of the\nStock Exchange, well known to Sir Wm. Barrett and to friends of\nW. T. Stead as a man of high character.^\np 44. The Rev. C. Godfrey, of Eastbourne, England had been\nreading a first edition copy of Phantastns of the Living. On the\nnight of 15 November 1886, he determined to appear if possible to\nhis friend Mrs \u2014. He had never dropped the slightest hint of any\nsuch intention, and had not even mentioned the subject to her. He\nset to work, with all the volitional energy which he possessed, to\nstand at the foot of her bed. He endeavoured to translate himself,\nspiritually, into her room, and to attract her attention while standing\nthere. After sustaining this effort for perhaps eight minutes, he\nfell asleep. He then dreamed that he was meeting the lady on the\nnext morning and asking her if she had seen him last night. She\nreplied in the dream that she had, and that she had been sitting\nbeside him. He then awoke and found that it was 3.40 a.m. He\nimmediately made a brief written memorandum.\nOn 17 November, Mr Godfrey went to see someone residing in\nthe same house as Mrs \u2014. As he was leaving she called out from\nthe window that she had something special to tell him. Later in\nthe day she called, and with no prompting gave him an account of\nthe following experience. At about half-past 3 o'clock on the\nmorning of 16 November, she awoke with a start and with the idea\nthat someone had come into the room. She heard a curious sound,\nbut fancied it might be the birds in the ivy outside. She felt so\nrestless that she lit a candle and went downstairs for some soda-\nwater. As she returned, when she reached the bottom of the stairs,\nshe saw Mr Godfrey's figure, on the landing, about eleven steps up.\nIt was quite distinct and life-hke at first, though she remembered\n1 Phantasms of the Living, i. 108-9.\n2 W. T. Stead, Meal Ghost Stories (1921), p. 72 ; Barrett, Threshold of the\nUnseen (1918), 153.\n\f130] Visions and Apjxirifions 225\nnoticing only the upper part of the body. He was dressed in his\nusual style, and with an expression on his face that she had noticed\nwhen he had been looking very earnestly at anything. He stood\nthere, and she held up the candle and gazed at him for three or four\nseconds. Then, as she passed up the staircase, the apparition grew\nmore and more shadowy, and finally faded away. Soon after she\ngot upstairs again, the street lamps were put out, which usually\noccurred at about 3.45.\nMr Godfrey wrote out an account of his experience in a letter to\nMr Podmore on 17 November 1886, including a written account\nby the percipient.^ On 22 November 1886, Mr Podmore interviewed\nboth the appearer and the percipient, and noted their viva voce\naccount. Details from these different accounts have been combined\nin the above version.^\np 45. On 7 December 1886, at the suggestion of Mr Podmore,\nbut without giving Mrs \u2014 any reason to expect it, Mr Godfrey\nrepeated the experiment. While undressing, he concentrated his\nattention on the percipient. Then, for some ten minutes after\ngetting into bed, he devoted intense effort to transporting himself\n(spiritually) to her presence, and to making his presence felt both\nby voice and by placing his hand upon her head. He then fell asleep,\nand, as in the case previous, dreamed that he met her on the next day,\nasked her if she had seen him, and was told that she had seen hmi\nindistinctly.\nNext morning, her first words on seeing him were (laughmgly)\n\" Well, I saw you last night anyway.\" According to her written\naccount, she retired at 10.30 on 7 December. Suddenly she heard\na voice say \" Wake,\" and felt a hand rest on the upper side of her\nhead. She became wide awake in a second and distinctly saw a\nfigure leaning over her. The only light in the room was from the\nstreet lamp, which made a long line on the wall over the wash-\nstand. This fine of light was partly obscured by the figure. She\nturned round and the hand seemed to slip from her head and rest\non the pillow. There seemed to be a mist before the face of the\napparition, but she saw its outline and recognised it and the appear-\nance of the shoulders as being those of Mr Godfrey. During the\noccurrence, she heard a curious sound, something like a Jew\"s harp,\nand felt cold air streaming through the room. The time when the\napparition occurred was about 12.30.\nWritten accounts by both the appearer and the percipient were\nsent in on 8 December 1886.^\n1 The text gives this date as 16 November, but that is inconsistent with\nthe letter itself.\n2 Pluiiitasiiis of the Living (1886.

Sinclair after undressing, but\nbefore going to bed in New York City, \" willed \" himself to be in\nLakewood, N.J., at home to see if lie could see his wife and make her\nsee him. After a Kttle he seemed to himself to be standing in her\nroom before the bed, and saw her lying there. On that same night,\nbetween 8.30 and 9.0 p.m., his wife, just before retiring, saw him\nstanding \" as plain as could be \"in front of the bed. The apparition\nwas not in night clothes, but appeared as if dressed in a suit of clothes\nwhich actually was hanging in the closet at home. His face was set\nas if he were either dead or trying to accomplish something which\nwas beyond him.\nIn the morning the wife related this experience to her son. When\nthe husband returned, she told him about it before he mentioned\nhis experiment. Independent written accounts by the husband,\nwife and son were filed in 1894 ; Dr M. L. Holbrook asserted at that\ntime that he had known about it \" for years.\" ^\ns 47. At least seven years before the record of the following\nexperience was written out in 1907, the man who wrote it was away\nfrom home. He wakened at one a.m. and saw his wife standing at\nthe foot of his bed, in the dress which she ordinarily wore about the\nhouse in the mornings. She seemed perfectly normal. He exclaimed,\n\" What are you doing here ?\n\" She replied, \" I thought I would\ncome out and see how you are getting along.\" She walked around\nfrom the foot of the bed, bent over, kissed him, and disappeared.\nHe related the experience to a friend in the morning. On his\nreturn home, she began qiiizzing him about his sleep that night,\nand then, without hearing his accomit of his experience, confessed\nthat she had fixed her mind upon the intention of appearing to him.\nHer determination was to awaken him from sleep, to attract his\nattention to herself while she was on the opposite side of the room,\nto walk over to his bedside, and to kiss him. Her written account\nagrees essentially with his, except that according to her recollection\nshe appeared at 11 p.m., whereas she had determined to appear at\n1 a.m.\"\nIn addition to the primary and secondary experimental cases just\ncited, the following tertiary cases may be considered.\nt48. Some time before 1819, Councillor H. M. Wesermann, in\nDiisseldorf, claimed to have succeeded in four attempts to produce\ndreams along definitely specified lines in the minds of sleeping friends.\nEach of the experiments was directed at a different friend.

Mr John Moule of Codicote, England, determined in 1855\nto try to appear to a mesmeric subject of his. He concentrated and\ndreamed vividly of appearing to her.

Russell, who was living in Scot-\nland, suddenly made up her mind to go to Germany to see her\nmother and sisters, and determined to attempt to make her own\napparition notify them. For about ten minutes she thought most\nintensely of her sisters, and felt that she was half present at home,\nand could see her people.\nWhen she arrived she found that, at the time she had concentrated,\none of her sisters saw her quite clearly entering the room by one\ndoor, passing through it, opening the door of another room where\ntheir mother was, and shutting the door behind her. The sister\nrushed after what she thought was Mrs Russell, and was \" quite\nstupefied \" when no trace of her could be found.\nThe account by Mrs Russell was dated 8 June 1886. She wrote\nto the sister asking whether she remembered the occurrence, and\nreceived this reply, \" Of course I remember the matter as well as if\nit had happened to-day. Pray don't come appearing to me again !\n\"\nt51. An able and respected professor in Harvard University,\nwho was a colleague of Wilham James, reported to him the following\nexperiment. In 1883 or 1884, this professor resolved to try to\nproject his astral body to the presence of a friend, without telling\nher of his intention. At the time when he was trying to wish himself\ninto her presence, half a mile away, she thought she saw him looking\nthrough a crack of the door.

He, although he had no idea that the experiment was taking\nplace, reported later that at the time specified he was at the desk,\nhad his attention attracted to the keys, and twice thought he caught\na glimpse of a woman, though no one was there. The account is\ntaken from an article by Dr Backman, published in 1891.^\nIn addition to the above strictly experimental cases, the appearer\nis reported to have been concentrating his attention on the per-\ncipient, or on the percipient's environment, in cases t 7, t 9, 1 10\nand s 11.\nApparitions Corresponding with Dreams or\nHallucinations in the Appearers\nThe following cases are similar to some of the experimental cases\nin that the appearer is conscious of the percipient and of the per-\ncipient's surroundings. In some of the present group of cases, more-\nover, it seems clear that concentration of attention occurred, similar\nto that employed in the experiments.\nCases in the present group are like reciprocal dreams in that two\npercipients share closely similar hallucinatory experiences. The\nchief difference is that in each of the following cases, one percipient\nexperienced a dream, or vision, containing elements of the situation'\nin which the second percipient was awake, and that this second\npercipient (visually or otherwise) perceived the presence of an ap-\nparition of the dreamer in these surroundings.\ns 53. In 1854, the Rev. P. H. Newnham, then a student at\nOxford, had a vivid dream that he was stopping with the family of\nthe lady who later became his wife. He rushed upstairs, overtook\nhis fiancee on the top step, and passed his two arms round her\nwaist, under her arms, from behind. On this he woke, and a clock\nin the house struck ten almost immediately afterwards. He wrote\na detailed account of this the next morning to his fiancee. Crossing\nhis letter came one from the lady, telling that about ten o'clock\non the night when the dream occurred, on reaching the landing of\nthe stairs she heard the footsteps of the man to whom she was\nengaged quickly mounting the stairs after her, and then felt him\nput his arms round her waist.\nSome years later Mr and Mrs Newnham read over the two letters,\nnoted that their personal recollections \" had not varied in the least\ndegree therefrom,\" and then destroyed the letters.

On 3 October, 1863, Mr S. R. Wilmot sailed frora Liverpool\nfor New York, on tlie steamer City ofLimerich. His wife and children\nwere in Watertown, Conn. Toward morning on the night of Tuesday,\n13 October, he dreamed that he saw his wife come to the door of\nthe stateroom clad in her nightdress. At the door she seemed to\ndiscover that her husband was not the only occupant of the room,\nhesitated a httle, then advanced to his side, stooped down, kissed\nhim, and after caressing him for a few moments, quietly withdrew.\nIn the morning it developed that Wilmot's fellow passenger (whose\nberth was above his but set farther back) had, while awake, seen\na lady enter and act in a manner corresponding exactly with\nWilmot's dream of his wife's visit.\nThe wife did not meet the steamer at New York. Almost her\nfirst question, when they were alone together in Watertown, was,\n\" Did you receive a visit from me a week ago Tuesday ?\n\" \"A\nvisit from you ?\n\" Wilmot asked ; \"we were more than a thousand\nmiles at sea.\" ffis wife then told him that she had been worried\nabout him on account of the going ashore of another ship, the\nAfrica. On Tuesday night she had lain awake thinking of him, and\nabout four o'clock in the morning it seemed to her that she went\nout to seek him. Crossing the stormy sea, she came to a steamship.\nDescending into the cabin, she passed through it to the stern until\nshe came to his stateroom. (Although she had never seen the ship,\nshe described it correctly in every particidar.) She noted the upper\nberth, set back farther than the lower. In it she saw a man looking\nat her, and for a moment was afraid, but soon went up to the side\nof his berth, bent down and kissed her husband, embraced him,\nand then went away.\nThis experience was written out by a man to whom he told it,\nand the manuscript was corrected and signed by Mr Wilmot about\n1885. Mrs Wilmot confirmed the experience in writing in 1890.\nMr Wilmot's sister, who accompanied him on the voyage, wrote\nand signed a statement telling of having discussed the experience,\nat the time and also three years later, with the man who had been\nin the upper berth. The facts about the sailing of the Cihj of\nLimerick and the going ashore of the Africa have been verified from\nnewspaper accoimts published in 1865.^\ns 55.

The impression\nwas so strong that her husband had gone to the door to see if Mary\npossibly could be there.\nBoth sisters, and their husbands, submitted signed statements\nabout their parts in this experience in 1894 ; the letters were not\npreserved.^\np 56.

Elliott was dead.\nInstantly, in her dream, she rushed to Miss Elliott's room, entered\nit, went to her bedside and pulled the clothes from off her face.\nMiss Elliott was quite cold ; her eyes were wide open and staring\nat the ceiling. This frightened Miss Bevan so that she dropped at\nthe foot of the bed, and knew no more until she found herself half\nout of bed in her own room, and wide awake. She then heard the\nclock strike five.\nMiss Elhott wrote that she awoke on this same morning and was\nlying on her back with eyes fixed on the ceiling, when she heard the\ndoor open and felt someone come in and bend over her. Miss\nElliott did not move, but instead of kissing her, Constance went\nand crouched at the foot of the bed, moving the bed-clothes from\nMiss Elliott's feet. When the apparition touched her bare foot,\nMiss Elliott knew nothing more till she found herself out of bed\nlooking for Constance. She never doubted that she had really been\nthere until she saw both doors fastened on the inside. She looked\nat her watch and found that it was a few minutes past five.\nBoth participants wrote independent accounts in February 1884.\nBefore leaving her room on the morning in question. Miss Bevan\nhad told the dream to her sister, who sent in a signed statement to\nthat effect.\n2\np 57. About the end of October 1884, Jno. T. Milward Pierce\nwas trying to catch a horse on a ranch in Nebraska. The horse\nkicked him in the face, splitting two teeth, but leaving no visible\nsurface injury. He backed away to avoid the next kick, and leaned\nagainst a stable wall. A moment only had passed when he saw on\nhis left, apparently quite close, what appeared to be the young lady\nto whom he was engaged, but who actually at that moment\nwas 25 miles away, in Yankton, Dakota. She was pale, and her\neyes looked troubled. Her whole form appeared, looking perfectly\nmaterial and natural. The vision lasted, perhaps, a quarter of a\nminute. Pierce's attention was distracted by someone who asked\n1 Myers, Hummi Personality, i. 417-8 ; Journ. S.P.B.

When he looked back, she had vanished.\nPierce's mind was entirely clear, for he went at once to his office\nand drew plans and specifications for a new house.\nHe was so haunted by the appearance that, next morning, he\nstarted for Yankton. The first words the young lady said when he\nmet her were, \" Why, I expected you all yesterday afternoon. I\nthought I saw you looking so pale, and your face all bleeding.\" He\nasked when this happened and she said, \" Immediately after lunch.\"\nIt was just after his lunch that the horse kicked him.\nThe account from Pierce was dated 5 January 1885. He stated\nthat he had taken down the particulars at the time they happened.\nBefore verification directly from the young lady could be obtained,\nshe underwent a severe illness, and her recollection of details was\nrather vague. In a letter written 27 May 1885, Pierce said that she\nwished him to say that she recollected the afternoon in question,\nremembered expecting him (though it was not his usual day for\ncoming) and recalled that she was afraid something had happened\nto him. On 13 July 1885 she sent a signed statement saying that\nshe remembered feeling sure some accident had happened, that she\nhad told Mr Pierce at the time everything unusual that she felt, and\nthat subsequent events had effaced all clear recollection of the\nfurther facts.^\np58. On 20 June 1905, Captain Frederick Ward drove Mrs\nEllen Green to the home of Mr and Mrs John Berwick, near Cardiff,\nwhere she was to spend a couple of days. He then returned to his\nown home, about two miles distant. On the way the horse upset\nthe trap, and Captain Ward was badly bruised and shaken. The\nnext afternoon, between three and four o'clock, he was lying on a\ncouch in his sitting room, wondering what Mrs Green would think\nif she knew of the occurrence. On that same afternoon, about half-\npast three, Mrs Green was sitting alone in the drawing-room of Mrs\nBerwick's house. Happening to look up, she saw Captain Ward,\ndressed in his usual clothes, standing at the bay window and looking\nat her as though he desired to speak to her. She rose hastily and\nwent toward the window caUing to him and waving her hand to him,\npartly in greeting and partly as a sign for him to go to the hall door.\nWhen she reached the window she was surprised not to see him.\nShe hurried to the door, but he was not there, nor was anyone\nanywhere near the house.\nMeantime Captain Ward, at his home, suddenly heard Mrs\nGreen's voice outside the house. He managed with difficulty to\nget to the window to call her in, and was greatly amazed not to see\nher, and to find no one there.\nShortly after seeing the apparition, Mrs Green told Mr and Mrs\n^ Phantasms of the Living, ii. 156-8.\n\f232 Horn ell Hart and Ella B. Hart [part\nBerwick about it. Next day Captain Ward came over to take her\nto the station, and told of his experience. The two percipients and\nMr and Mrs Berwick signed a joint statement of the experience on\n26 July 1905. Captain Ward sent in an independent statement on\n2 August 1905.1\ns 59. The following case was reported to Hyslop by Dr Albert\nH. Eoler of Chicago, sometime between 1906 and 1909. The\ndoctor's mother, on comparing notes with him \" a few weeks \" after\nthe event, told of having had a vivid \" nightmare \" between 2 and\n3 a.m. on 17 July. She dreamed that she was in the bedroom where\nher husband had died the previous spring, in Dr Roler's home,\n300 miles distant. She thought she saw her husband lying on the\nbed, as he had between his death and his funeral, but in her dream\nhe moved and made an effort to rise. Startled, she rushed into the\nnext bedroom, where Dr Roler slept, and called \" Bert, oh Bert !\n\"\nAt that instant she awoke, looked at her watch, and was unable to\nsleep again for some time because of the vividness of the dream.\nOn the same night, at the same hour, her son dreamed that he saw\nher standing, much agitated, in the doorway of the bedroom where\nhis father had died, and he awoke hearing her call \" Bert, oh Bert !\n\"\nThe experience was so vivid that he woke his wife, told her the\ndream, and could not sleep again for some time. Dr Roler offered\nto provide Dr Hyslop with affidavits from his mother and his wife,\nbut these are not published with the account.^\np 60. On 11 February 1912, Mrs Barnard was up nearly all night\nwith two sicii children. Her two other children were away at school,\nand both had measles. One of these, named Francis, was much on\nher thoughts on this night. Twice during the night Mrs Barnard\ndreamed that he wanted to put his head on her shoulder and could\nnot because baby Betty, whom she was holding, was in the way.\nEach time she woke up to find herself telling Francis to be careful\nof the baby. Although no one had told her that Francis was not\nin his own room during his illness, she became aware that he was\nin the big dormitory, in the third bed on the door side.\nOn this same night Francis was very ill in the bed just specified.\nBoth when asleep and when awake he felt his mother close beside\nhim. He wanted to put his head on her shoulder and could not\nbecause she was holding the baby in her arms. He wrote her of\nthis experience ten days later, asking if she had been thinking of\nhim.

Steele awoke to find herself standing in the middle of\nher bedroom, answering, \" All right, I'm coming,\" to a Mr Claude\nBurgess, whom she thought she had heard call, \" Miss Steele !\nMiss Steele ! Miss Steele !\n\" Mr Burgess was an invaUd who had\nbeen staying at her private hotel, but three weeks previously he had\nmoved to another address in the same city. By the time she had\nput on her dressing gown, she recalled that he had gone ;\nshe looked\nat her clock and noted that it was exactly 3 a.m. Later in the day\nshe received the following letter from him :\n\" Dear Emma, I had a\nfunny dream about you last night. I dreamed that you appeared\nat about 3 a.m. Just a glimpse of you. It's funny, isn't it ? Yours,\nClaude Burgess.\"\nIn response to inquiries. Burgess stated that he woke up and then\nsaw an absolutely distinct apparition of Miss Steele standing at the\ndoor of his bedroom. He had closed the door, but she appeared to\nhave opened it. She was attired in her ordinary dress. Although\nthe room appeared dark, Miss Steele looked just as she would have\nappeared in daylight.\nMiss Steele wrote out and sent in her account on 13 March 1912.\nThe original letter from Burgess was placed on file with the Society\nfor Psychical Research. Signed corroborative statements were\nsecured on 13 March from Miss Steele's cook (to whom she told her\nexperience before receiving the letter) and from the man who carried\nthe letter ; on 27 April signed statements were filed by a husband\nand wife to whom the events were related on the evening of the day\nwhen they occurred.^\ns 62. In 1918-9, in Hartford, Conn., Mrs BX. roused one night to\na state which seemed to be neither waking nor sleeping. She could\nsee the objects in the bedroom, but felt as if she were in a trance.\nHer husband was sleeping beside her. She was gradually aware\nthat he seemed to be rising in a position parallel to his physical\nbody, and to be floating a few feet above her. This floating body\nshe sensed rather than saw, and yet with pecuUar intensity. The\nfloating body approached the window. The wife then put out her\nhand to touch the physical body of her sleeping husband beside her.\nHe gave a long sigh and awoke. \" I had a strange dream,\" she said.\n\" So did I,\" he returned. He then told her that he had been dreaming\n1 Proc. S.P.R. (1923), xxxiii. 398-9 ; Journ. S.P.R. (1912), xv. 259-62.\n\f234 Hornell Hart and Ella B.

In 1754, in England, the Rev. Joseph Wilkins, when about\n100 miles from his parental home, dreamed \" very perfectly \" that\nhe visited it, tried the front door, entered the back, and conversed\nwith his mother. On the same night the mother heard him try the\nfront door and enter the back, and heard the spoken words of his\ndream. In his account, written some years later, Wilkins describes\na letter written by his father about this event immediately after it\noccurred.^\nt 64. Mr Crowell F. Varley, chief engineer of the electric tele-\ngraph in England testified before the London Dialectical Society in\n1869 that on one occasion when he was in danger of being asphyxiated\nfrom the fumes of a chloroform sponge which he had used to put\nhimself to sleep, his apparition succeeded in rousing his wife, who\nwas sleeping in another part of the house. He was able gradually\nto recall having seen himself with the sponge on his mouth, unable\nto move, and having exerted all his will to make his danger clear\nto his wife.^\nReciprocal Dreams\nIn the group of cases just presented, there are several examples\nof apparitions coinciding with dreams in which the appearer saw\nthe percipient and the percipient's surroundings. Reciprocal\ndreams proper involve the reciprocal perception of each other by\ntwo or more percipients, in a common dream environment. In-\ncluded here also, however, are authenticated cases of dreams\nparalleling each other in various respects, even where the dreamers\ndid not dream of each other.\np 65. In July 1887, a Mr and Mrs H., both on the same night,\ndreamed that they were walking in Richmond Park with their\nfriend J. They were discussing an invitation to a party, to be given\nby Lady R.

An account written by Mrs H. was signed by both dreamers\nand sent in the following months\ns 66. Two young men were sleeping in the same bed one night in\n1891. They had often discussed the marriage which one of the boys\nplanned, but which his parents and the other young man opposed.\nOn this night, the youth who contemplated the marriage dreamed\nthat the ceremony was about to occur in the dining-room, but that\nhis friend came rushing into the house, in shirt-sleeves, and insisted\nthat it must not take place. The friend dreamed on the same night\nthat he hurried off, coatless, to the place where the marriage was\nabout to take place, that he found his friend in a back room, where\nhis father was trying to get him to change his mind. He dreamed\nthat he called the prospective groom aside and tried fruitlessly to\ntalk him out of the plan, and then went home in disgust. In-\ndependent accounts were written in Lehmann's, La., by the two\ndreamers in 1893, and the father also testified at that time that his\nson had told him of the dream the morning after it had occurred.'^\np 67. In Elmira, N.Y., on 26 January 1892, between 2 and 3 a.m.,\nDr Adele Gleason dreamed that she stood in a lonesome place\nin dark woods, that great fear came over her, that the presence\nof her friend, J. R. Joslyn came to her and shook a tree by her, and\nthat its leaves began to turn to flame. On the same night, at the\nsame hour, Joslyn dreamed in another house in Elmira, that he\nfound Dr Gleason in a lonely wood after dark, apparently paralysed\nwith fear, that he went to her side and shook a bush, when the falling\nleaves turned into flame. Both dreamers submitted written ac-\ncounts within a month of the occurrence. The accounts agree that\nwhen the two dreamers met, four days after the event, she mentioned\nhaving had a strange dream, but that he at once stopped her and\nrelated his own dream first, without suggestion from her. Dr\nHodgson made written inquiries and found that Dr Gleason had\nmade a record of the dream in her notebook the morning after it\noccurred, and before she saw Joslyn.^\ns 68. In 1897, a Mr Davis dreamed one night that he was helping\ntwo ladies across the ruined planking of an old saw-mill, built over\nblack, stagnant water. Something white, glimmering below, proved\nto be the face of his wife, just showing above the water, with her\neyes looking into his. but without a motion or sound.

He shook her to waken her and asked what she had\ndreamed to frighten her. She had just been dreaming of finding\nherself sinking in a pond of water by the roadside, of throwing up\nher arms above the water, and trying to scream for help. Just as\nshe felt her hand grasped by someone, to help her, Mr Davis spoke,\nand she awoke. Both dreamers wrote independent accounts (in\nNew York City ?) about two years after the occurrerice.^\np 69. In the small hours of the morning of 7 October 1900, an\nassociate of the S.P.R. awoke with a painful conviction that his\nwife, who was that night sleeping in another part of the house, had\nburst a varicose vein, in the calf of her leg, and that he could feel\nthe swelled place, three inches long. He wondered whether she\nwould be able to bandage it and come upstairs to where he was\nsleeping. She also awoke, at 2.15 that morning, with a vivid im-\npression that a vein had burst, and that her husband was there and\ncalled her attention to it. She thought she felt the blood trickling\ndown her leg. When she became fully awake she found that her\nleg was in its usual condition and that no break had occurred. She\nwondered then whether she would have been able to bandage it\nand go up to him. Both participants wrote independent accounts\nof their experience on the same day when it happened. It will be\nnoted that at least part of the coincident experience occurred in a\nhalf-awake or wide-awake state, though both of them were in a\ndream-like condition when the experience began.\n^\np 70. In January 1901 (somewhere in America ?), a man and\nhis wife both dreamed that his mother (who was dead) came into\nthe room and stood at the foot of the wife's bed. The wife's dream\nincluded hearing the mother say that the wife's mother would not\nlive three months. The dreamers told each other at breakfast. The\nhusband sent a written account two days later, and the wife replied\nto an inquiry that she had nothing to add and no change to make in\nthe statement made by her husband. The wife's mother (who was\n83 years old, and seriously ill at the time of the dream) actually\ndied six months later.\n^\np 71. In October 1907, in Baltimore, Md., Carl A. Jacobson\ndreamed very realistically that his wife's sister Ada had one of the\nepileptic fits to which she was subject, and that he worked with her\nto get her out of it, but that she died.

The body lying there\nin her dream was such a gruesome sight that she could not stand to\nlook at it, but went out of the room.\nThese simultaneous dreams made such an impression that the\nfollowing day Mary wrote to her other sister, telling her about them\nand requesting her to tell Ada to be careful. Ada laughed when\nshe heard it, and said, \" It's funny they bother so much about me.\"\nAbout three weeks later, on 11 November, Ada was struck and\nkilled at a grade crossing in York, Pa. Presumably she was just\ngoing into one of her seizures, and could not move as the train bore\ndown upon her.\nOn 14 November 1907, Jacobson made a note in his diary of\nthe coincidental dreams and the correspondence with the sister.\nA photostat of the page containing this record was submitted in\nevidence. Dr Jacobson (who had been awarded his Ph.D. degree\nin the meantime) wrote an account of this experience for Dr Prince\nin 1930, and his wife wrote an account of hers in 1931.^\np 72.

He revived a little and said, \" I am\nfeeling very ill. I think I am dying.\"\nOn this same night this man's brother-in-law dreamed very\nvividly that he saw him lying unconscious and ghastly on the floor.\nIn the dream he lifted him with difliculty to the bed. He then tried\nunavailingly to get assistance. A woman promised to get some\nwhiskey, but did not come back.\nOn this same night the daughter of this dreamer also dreamed\nthat her uncle had said \" I am very ill\n\" and had left the room, that\nshe then found him lying unconscious, and that neither she nor\nothers were able to go to his assistance.\nThe two dreamers, the cook, and the physician who treated the\nsick man, all signed statements covering their experiences.

On a morning in February 1924, a man dreamed that a\nlong-necked bird (something like a cross between a turkey and a\npheasant) was rubbing his wife's eyes with its beak, and that he\nwarned her to be careful with her eyes. In his dream he heard her\nBay that it would be all right. She, at the same time, dreamed of\na swan coming up out of the sea and attacking a dog. In her dream\nshe crouched down, with the swan's neck over her. She kept quiet\nand said to her husband, in the dream, \" I suppose it could hurt me.\"\nHe replied, \"Oh, rather ! It could have your eyes out.\" A joint state-\nment of these dreams was written out immediately after the partici-\npants had related them to each other, and signed by both of them.^\np 75. On the night of 7-8 June 1925, in London, Theodore\nBesterman dreamed that he was in a room with an elderly woman\nand two men. He was aware that the woman suffered from devil-\nseeing delusions. She thought he was a devil, and charged at him,\nfull tilt. The two men held her back, but she seemed at the point\nof breaking loose. He then dreamed that he fainted because her\nmovements and featiires became so horrible. When he recovered\nfrom the swoon, he was in icy terror, but at this point he was\nawakened by the screams of his wife. She had just been dreaming\nthat she was with men friends visiting other people. She became\nconvinced that one man, with a black eye, was a devil. Friends,\nwho were standing behind her, urged her to sing a song, in which\nshe pointed him out as a devil. His eyes then blazed up horribly,\nand he seemed about to descend on her. She awoke screaming.\nMr and Mrs Besterman each wrote out their own account of the\ndreams on the following day.^\nIn addition to the eleven cases which fulfil the primary or second-\nary conditions of authentication, the following are worth notice,\nthough the evidence is not so well supported as in the first group.\n1 Journ.

The dreamer saw two\nhorror-stricken friends rushing into the street to save him, but\nbefore they could get there the assailant crashed through Brown's\nforehead with a hatchet. The next morning the man who had\nbeen the foremost rescuer in the dream told spontaneously, and\nwithout prompting, of having dreamed his part in the drama in\ngreat detail, corresponding accurately with Brown's dream. Within\na week the second dream-rescuer also spontaneously told of having\ndreamed his part also. The written account, by Brown, was dated\nfour years after the dreams occurred.^\nt 77. In 1905 to 1907 Miss Irene A Wright was city editor of the\nHavana Telegrajjh. One night she dreamed that the editor had done\nher a grievous wrong.

She says that she and Sir Walter Gibbons\ncompared notes about their astral journeys to the same place, and\nverified each other's experiences. She has not presented an in-\ndependently written account by Sir Walter, and the latter has not\nreplied to a letter from the present writer, asking for confirmation\nof the experience.*\nThe degree to which the pairs of participants in the above cases\nactually shared in each other's dreams, as distinguished from a mere\nsensing by one of some aspects of the other's dream experience, is\ndifiicult to determine, but apparently varies widely.

In p 70, the husband noted that the dream apparition\nof the mother went to his wife's bed, implying a consciousness of\nhis wife's presence. The account of her dream does not mention\nthe husband or even his bed, but the setting obviously was the same.\nThese eight cases, then, may be fairly classified as shared dreams.\nIn case s 66 it is not clear whether the young men reported vaguely\na genuinely shared dream, or whether merely telepathic or accidental\nlikenesses were involved. In cases s 68 and t 78 the dreams differ\ntoo much from each other to be regarded as shared, p 72 is really\na double telepathic dream, in which both dreamers appear to have\nshared experiences of the sick man or of those near him, but in\nwhich neither dreamer was conscious of the participation of the\nother. In p 73 E. seems to have shared, in a somewhat altered\nfashion, certain aspects of Ann's half-awake experience. In p 74,\nthe dreamers each dreamed of the other, and the central trends of\nthe dreams are alike, but the details are too different to consider\nthe case a truly shared dream.\nThe extent to which experiences on the borderline between\nsleeping and waking entered into cases p 69, p 72, and p 73, is worth\nnoting. The line between dreaming and waking experience is not\na clear one, as had already been pointed out in connection with\ncases s 59 and p 60.\nWhat are the Probabilities that Phenomena of the\nTypes Herein Reported Actually Occur ?\nWhat is the probability that apparitions located in space-time are\nactually perceived collectively ? If a single case were absolutely\nproved, it would be necessary to admit that collectively perceived\napparitions actually occur. But the sceptic may raise the question\nwhether any given instance may not be the result of a conspiracy\nto hoax, or the product of a combination of errors, delusions and\ncoincidences. How strong a case is built up by a collection of the\nsort presented in this study ? What is the approximate probability\nthat in this collection there is no single valid case ?\nCases s 6 to t 39 inclusive and also s 54\u2014a total of 35\u2014involve\nreports of collectively perceived apparitions. If all of these cases\nhad been reported to have happened in London in 1884, or in\nWashington in 1925, the presumption might arise that an epidemic\nof hoaxes had arisen\u2014that one story had inspired others, and that\ntherefore the whole group as a unit should be regarded with sus-\npicion. Actually, however, the alleged occurrences range in date\nfrom 1839 to 1932\u2014a span of 93 years. In location, about half\n\f130] Visions and Apparitions 241\noccurred in the British Isles, a smaller number in the United States,\nand the rest in places scattered about the world. In view of the\nvery wide chronological and geographical spread of the cases, it\nseems reasonable to assume that their probabilities are fairly in-\ndependent of one another.\nThe probability that every one of a collection of independent\ncases is false is equal to the product of the probabilities that each\nindividually is false. Judgments as to the veracity of a given case\nwill vary widely. But in order to illustrate the order of probability\nestablished by this collection, the writer will assume that the\nprobability of falsity of each primary case is -3, of each secondary\ncase -5, and each tertiary case -7. The collection of reports of collec-\ntively perceived apparitions includes 6 primary cases, 15 secondary,\nand 14 tertiary. Under the assumption just stated, the probability\nthat all of the primary cases are false amounts to the sixth power\n-3 which equals -000729 ; the probability that each of the secondary\ncases is false amounts to the 15th power of -5, or -000030 ;\nthe\nprobability that all the tertiary cases are false amounts to the lith\npower of -7, or -006782. The probability that every case in all three\ngroups combined is false amounts to the product of these three\nprobabilities, which is -00000000015, or one chance out of ap-\nproximately 6,770,000,000.\nJudging the original probabilities of truth in the case reports as\nb>eing better or worse than that assumed above will, of course,\naffect this combined estimate. Suppose, for example, one made\nthe sceptical assumption that there were 9 chances in 10 that each\ncase, taken by itself, was a hoax. Under that assumption there\nwould still be only about 1 chance in 40 that every case in the 35\nwas a hoax.\nIn estimating the probable truth or falsity of the individual case\nreports, it is important to remember that the seeing of apparitions\nis not in question. Even the most conservative psychologists accept\nthe fact that some people, under certain circumstances, believe that\nthey are seeing persons who, according to ordinary tests, are not\nthere. Neither is the seeing of veridical apparitions to be judged\nexclusively or even mainly on the basis of the evidence herein\n.adduced. Scores, if not hundreds of other cases have been re-\nported in which the occurrence of apparitions has been alleged to\niave coincided with related events not normally known to the\npercipients. The question at issue in relation to the present 35 cases\nis this : granted that people do see apparitions, and that some\napparitions may coincide, in ways not expUcable by chance, with\nevents not normally known to the percipients, what is the probability\nthat these reports of the same apparitions being seen at the same\ntime by two or more percipients are genuine ?\n\f242 Hornell Hart and Ella B. Hart [part\nMoreover, in seeking the absolutely most probable estimate of\nthe truth of such accoimts as we have been considering, it is necessary\nto contemplate not merely the records of experiences actually\nassembled here, but the probable collection which would have\nresulted if an exhaustive study could have been made. Obviously,\nonly a small fraction of actual accounts of seeing apparitions have\never been published. The present writers cannot hope to have made\nan exhaustive collection of even the published cases. In view of\nthe strong probabilities established by the present cases, it seems\nclear that a truly exhaustive collection of the evidence which already\nexists, or has existed, would establish overwhelmingly the proposition\nthat collectively perceived apparitions of types more or less similar\nto those covered in this study do occur.\nWhat is the j)rohahility that apparitions have been produced ex-\nperimentally ? Of apparitions corresponding with deliberate\nattempts to produce them, 13 cases are recorded. These cases\ninvolve 11 different experimenters who reported a total of 19\ndifferent successful attempts to project apparitions of themselves.\nThe cases range in date from 1819 to 1900. Eight occurred in the\nBritish Isles, 2 on the Continent, 2 in the United States, and one is\nnot localised. There is somewhat more tendency for these cases\nto be clustered than the examples of apparitions. Five of the\nexperimental cases occurred in England during the years 1881 tO'\n1886, and at least three of these experiments were stimulated by\nreading about other attempts. Whether this reduces or enhances\nthe reUabiUty of the reports may be left to the judgment of the\nreader. But one additional source of strength in these reports is\nthe fact that in two cases (p 43 and p 45) the experiments were\nmade with the advice and foreknowledge of eminent psychical\nresearchers.\nOf the cases in this group, 4 are primary, 4 secondary, and 5\ntertiary in evidential quality. Assuming that the probabiUties of\nhoax, misreporting, and the like are -3 for primary cases, -5 for\nsecondary and -7 for tertiary cases, the probability that all 14 cases\nare falsified would be -000853. Assuming that the chances of hoax\nor credulous misreporting is -9 for every case, the chances that all\n13 are false would be about 1 in 4.\nAnother way to approach the question of the probability that\nexperimental projection of apparitions is a demonstrated pheno-\nmenon, would be to ask what would be the attitude of physicists,,\nchemists or biologists, toward an hypothesis with respect to which\n20 successful crucial experiments had been reported, assuming that\nthe reports varied in their authentication as these 20 vary.\nWhatever may be the answers given by different readers to these\nquestions, it may certainly be said, with all due scientific caution^\n\f130] Visions and Apparitions 243\nthat a sufficiently strong case has been made out for this type of\nphenomenon to justify exploring the corollaries which follow if\nexperimental projection is possible.\nWhat is the probability that apjMritmis sometimes correspond, and\nhate causal connections, ivith dreams ? The 12 reported cases of this\ntype string out from 1754 to 1918. Seven occurred in England ;\n4 in the United States, and 1 on the Atlantic. As to evidential\nquality, 5 are primary, 5 secondary, and 2 tertiary. If the probabili-\nties of falsity are taken as being -3, -5 and -7 respectively, the odds\nagainst all of these cases being hoaxes or credulous misreports is\n1 in about 27,000 ; if the odds against each individual case are\ntaken to be 9 to 1, the odds that the 12 cases as a group are all false\nbecome 1 in 4.\nWhat is the probability that genuine reciprocal dreams occur ?\nOf this type of phenomenon, 15 cases have been reported in this\nstudy, ranging in date from 1869 to 1925, and about evenly divided\nbetween England and the United States. The fact that 9 of the\ncases are of primary evidential quality (in addition to 2 secondary\nand 4 tertiary) raises the authentication of this group to a high\npoint. The probability that all the cases are spurious (under [the\n\u20223, -5, -7 assumption) is -00000119, or 1 in about 840,000. Under\nthe 9 to 1 assumption for individual cases, the odds for the group\nbecome 1 in 5\n.\nSummary for cases as a whole. When the crystal visions are\nincluded, a total of 79 cases have been summarised in this study.\nOf these, 27 are primary, 26 secondary, and 26 tertiary. They\nrange in date from 1754 to 1932. About one-third occurred before\n1880 ; about one-third after 1900. About half of them happened in\nthe British Isles, chiefly in London and its environs. About one-\nfourth came from the United States. The rest were scattered\nwidely over the earth. In a word, even with the very inadequate\nefforts at collection which psychical research agencies have thus\nfar been able to make, the reporting of collective and reciprocal\napparitions and visions has been persistent and world-wide. It\nseems overwhelmingly probable that these reports have some basis\nin actual fact : the reality of jointly and reciprocally perceived\napparitions may be taken as demonstrated.\n'\nIn What Respects are these Apparitions\n\" Objective \" ?\nMeaning of the term \" objective^ To say that an apparition is\npurely subjective means that it has no existence independent of\nthe percipient. But when the attempt is made to set up tests of\nobjectivity, the distinction becomes rather elusive. Ultimately,.\n\fHornell Hart and Ella B. Hart [paet\nthe objective reality of an experience is to be measured in the\ndegrees to which it is capable of being shared with other people\nand the degrees to which it enters into working relations with the\nre3t of one s experience. Specifically, the following tests, while\nnot conclusive help to illuminate the degrees to which apparitions\ndescribed m these 80 cases partook of objectivity. j\nTo what exterd did these apparitions affect m.ore than one senjjl-\nMucii the most frequent type of apparition among those described\nm these cases is the purely visual.

In s 25, the three percipients all saw the apparition\n\f130] Visions and Apparitions 245\nenter, pass through the room, contemplate the same pictm-e, and\ndepart. In p 30, both percipients saw the figure of the mother\nbending over the bed of the dying boy. In s 31, the Colonel followed\nthe eyes of the dying man to the spot where they both saw the\napparition of Walt Whitman. In s 32, the rector and the two\n\"idely separated parishioners all saw the church warden apparition\n'...ending before the altar. Here then are eleven cases, in each of\nwhich two or more percipients (as far as their accounts relate the\nies of w the same figure in the same special location, wearing the\nigainst ;\nj.^^, with the same facial expressions and doing the same\nthmgs. Although these are perhaps the most striking cases, much\nthe same thing might be said of the other collective perceptions of\napparitions. If these experiences were subjective, they were\ncollectively subjective, and were consistent in their relations to\nthe material environment.\nTo what extent did the apparitions jJroduce effects upon the material\nenviroyiment ? In reports of other psychical phenomena it has\nfrequently been alleged that apparitions or materialised spirits\nhave opened doors, moved flowers about, left imprints on gravel\nwalks, on dental wax, on smoked paper, and on photographic plates,\nmade paraf&n moulds of hands, feet or other members, and produced\nother lasting modifications in the material environments in which\nthey appeared. The nearest approach to such phenomena which\nhave been noted in these cases are the mirror reflections in s 18\nand s 19, the casting of a shadow in s 26 and p 45, the oj^ening of\nthe door in t 50, the trying of the front door in t 64, and the ex-\ntinguishing of the light in t 22. Most if not all of these may well\nhave been subjective impressions. If collective observations in\n.seance rooms were included, far more data would appear on this\npoint, but the difficulty of demonstrating to sceptical investigators\nthe absence of fraud in such phenomena makes it necessary to treat\n\\\nprofessional mediumistic seances as a special category, and to confine\nthe present study to spontaneous and wow-seance experimental cases.\nIn what ways did the apparitions transcend ordinary space-time\n.conditions ? Distance has been transcended radically in many of\nthese experiences. In cases t 50, t 52, s 54, s 59 and t 63, the\ndistances between appearer and percipient were measurable in\nhundreds of miles ; in case t 9, thousands of miles are reported to\nhave been transcended.\nThe apparitions were observed in a number of cases to pass\nthrough material obstacles. In case s 31, the apparition of Whitman\nwas seen to pass through a bed ; in s 26, the apparition of the naval\nofficer was seen to pass through the wall ; in t 23 the woman and\nbaby did this ; in p 20, the figure sank through the floor ; in t 9 it\n.sank through the floor and locked door ; in s 29 it went up through\n\f246 Hornell Hart and Ella B. Hart [part\nthe ceiling. In cases t 22, s 26, and p 56, the apparitions were\ndiscovered in rooms known to have been locked. In case 1 14, the\npercipient attempted to catch hold of the apparition, but could get\nhold of nothing. In p 20, the percipient caught hold of something,\nbut it was dragged away as the apparition sank into the floor.\n(Yet in the various tactile cases, the apparitions became tangible\nin certain respects.) The apparitions were transparent to at least\none percipient in t 13 and t 38. They took form gradually in p 5\nand s 31. They faded gradually from sight in s 15, s 21, s 24, s 29,\ns 40 and p 44. They vanished suddenly under the eyes of the\npercipients in s 6, s 19, p 31 and t 37. The apparitions were seen\nin normally impossible positions in two cases\u2014on the ceiling in s 11,\nand on the wall in s 29. The visions were self-luminous or carried\ntheir illumination with them in s 19, t 22, t 23, s 29, s41, and\nprobably in some other cases.\nSummary. Apparitions, in the above cases, typically transcend\nspacial separation even of hundreds of miles, and typically pass\nthrough ordinary matter. Yet they may produce effects on the\nsenses of touch and hearing at the same time as that of sight, and\nthey have frequently been seen by two or more observers, whose\nreports of their appearance, facial expression, costume, position,\nmovements, and other details, correspond so closely as to indicate\nthat the experience was shared to a degree approaching that of\nordinary sense experience.\nTo What Extent were these Apparitions Conscious\nPersonalities\nConscious a-pfaritions of living persons. In 10 of the cases cited,\na definite dream, vision or clairvoyant experience corresponded\nclosely enough with the setting in which the apparition occurred\nto justify the inference that the focus of consciousness of the appearer\nwas in the apparition. These cases are s 46, t 52, s 53, s 54, p 56>\ns 59, p 60, s 62, t 63, and t 64. This list includes 3 primary, 5\nsecondary, and 3 tertiary cases. (In case p 57, the conscious\nmemory of the appearer terminated before the apparition completed\nits activity.) In addition, 5 cases (of which 4 are primary) include\nsuggestions that some vague consciousness existed. In t 50, the\nappearer \" felt in her thoughts she herself was half present at home,\nand could see her people,\" but gave no evidence that this conscious\nexperience corresponded with what actually happened at home at\nthe time. In p 42, Mr Beard made a memorandum that \" while\nconcentrating he seemed to himself to be actually in the house.\"'\nIn p44 and p 45, Mr Godfrey had dreams in which the experiences\nof the percipient were reported to him in a way possibly suggestive\nof sub-conscious knowledge on his part of what had taken place.\n\f130] Visions and Apparitions 247\nIn p 57, the appearer thought she saw her fiance looking pale and\nwith his face bleeding at the time when he was kicked in the face\nand when she appeared to hini. His face, however, was actually\nnot bleeding.\nIn two cases\u2014p 5 and t 8\u2014the appearer and the percipient were\nthe same person. In two others\u2014s 40 and t 51 \u2014it is stated specifi-\ncally that the appearer had no memory of the experience of ap-\npearing. Presumably this was true also in other experimental and\ncollectively observed cases where no statement on this point is made.\nIn case t 64 the memory of the experience was recaptured only by\npersistent effort. It would be exceedingly interesting to discover\nwhether hypnotism or other methods of tapping the sub-conscious\ncould elicit suppressed memories of apparitional experiences in\nsuch cases. In the absence of data of that sort, it can only be said\nthat some apparition of living persons seem to have been self-\nconscious personahties, while others seem to have retained only\nvague memories, or no memories whatever, of their having appeared.\nAs far as can be judged from the cases at hand, these unconscious,\nor partly conscious (or perhaps forgetful) apparitions were of much\nthe same types as the fully conscious ones. They spoke (p 45 and\ns 40), touched the percipient (p 43 and p 45), made apparently\nintelligent adaptations of their movements to their physical sur-\nroundings and the people in them (p 5, s 40, p 42, p 45, t 50, and\nt 51), and showed much the same tendency to appear to loved\npersons, as the conscious apparitions did. It may possibly be\nsignificant that the apparitions in s 40, p 44, and p 45 showed\ntendencies to take shape slowly, be misty or dissolve gradually,\nwhereas this characteristic is not reported for any of the fully\nconscious apparitions. It may also be worth noting that four of\nthe conscious cases are reported to have occurred at distances of\n100 miles or more, between appearer and percipient, while only one\nof the vaguely conscious or unconscious cases were at such a distance.\nAre the apparitions of the dead similar in observable characteristics\nto the conscious apparitions of the living ? In 16 of the cases, ap-\nparitions of persons known to be dead were collectively observed.\nWith these, probably, should be classed also cases p 20, p 21 and\nt 23. In what reported aspects were these 19 apparitions similar to,\nand in what reported aspects different from, the 11 conscious\napparitions of living persons ? Due to the method of selecting\ncases for this study, all of the reported apparitions of dead persons\nwere collectively perceived. But of the conscious apparitions of\nliving persons, s 55 was also collectively perceived.\nThe self-conscious apparitions spoke to the percipients in cases\ns 59, t 63 and t 64 ;\nthey touched the percipients in s 53, s 54, s 56\nand apparently in s 60. Apparitions of the dead are reported to\n\f248 Hornell Hart and Ella B. Hart [part\nhave spoken to percipients in cases s 24, s 26, and s 28 ; in s 28\nand s 31 they are reported to have touched the percipients. Con-\nscious apparitions of the living are reported to have made intelligent\nor apparently purposeful adjustments to physical objects or to\npeople in 7 of the 11 cases\u2014s 53, s 54, p 56, s 59, s 62, t 63 and t 64.\nApparitions of the dead are reported to have made such adjustments\nin cases p 5, s 24, s 25, s 26, s 28, p 30, s 31, s 32, p 43, t 36, t 37 and\nt 48\n\u2014\ni.e. 12 of the 16 cases. A conscious apparition passed through\na locked door in case p 56 ;\napparitions of the dead passed through\nphysical objects in p 20, t 23, s 26, s 29 and s 31 ;\nthey disappeared\nsuddenly in cases p 21, p 30 and t 37.\nIn the matter of taking shape or fading out gradually, of being\ntransparent, and of being self-luminous, differences occur. None\nof the fully conscious apparitions showed any of these character-\nistics, while 9 of the apparitions of the dead showed one or more\nof them\u2014namely, p 5, 1 13, p 20, p 21, t 23, s 24, s 29 and s 31.\nHowever, apparitions of the living who did not retain conscious\nmemories of appearing showed tendencies to fading in s 40, p 44\nand p 45.\nThe apparitions of the dead had it reported that they wore\nordinary clothes in 13 cases, but this was probably because of the\ngeneral expectation that they might wear something else. Of the\nconscious apparitions, s 46 was reported to be wearing ordinary\nclothing, and s 55 had on a night-dress.\nThe emotional connections between appearers and percipients\nseem to have been much the same in the group of conscious appari-\ntions as in that of apparitions of the dead. In the conscious group,\nthe relationship between appearer and percipient was husband and\nwife, or betrothed, in 4, mother (or father) and child in 3, and friend\nor near relation in 2 cases ; in only one case was the percipient a\nstranger. For dead persons, there were among the percipients a\nhusband, wife, or betrothed, in 3 cases ; a son or daughter in 8 ; and\na close friend or relative in 14. In only 3 cases was the apparition\nseen only by strangers, though this number would probably be\nincreased if full facts were available about doubtful cases.\nFour of the apparitions of the dead occurred at a time of crisis\nfor the percipient or the person toward whom the apparition was\ndirected : in s 25 the old mother appeared at her son's portrait at\nthe moment when he was consummating a business achievement\nalong the lines which she had urged ; in s 26, the dead father ap-\npeared to his son at a time of financial and moral crisis ;\nin p 30\nthe mother appeared at the bedside of her son when he was dying ;\nin t 35 the dead woman appeared in the house where her beloved\nsister was dying. But conscious apparitions of the living also\ntended to appear at times of crisis for the percipient. In s 46 the\n\f130] Visions and Apparitions 249\nhusband, worried about his wife, appeared by her bed. In s 54,\nthe wife came in apparitional form to her storm-tossed and seasick\nhusband, about whom she had been concerned. In p 57, the ap-\nparition of the fiancee was seen by the man who had just undergone\na painful accident. In p 60, the presence of the mother came to\nthe sick boy.\nExcept, then, that they show tendencies to be self-hmimous and\ntransparent, and to fade in or out, the collectively observed appari-\ntions of the dead seem to be closely similar in character to the\nconscious apparitions of the living.\n\f: >. :. ^ ; :.t:. \".:'\u2022>\u2022(!:\u2022 ji .: rt;;;0 5>m: lutbj; od ;J?x'ta cH\n: :\n'; :'i;r'1 .!:-r';;- ill ; >; 'r;ii .^i .: \"^J:.-;^ tG i:;:;:is .oojlwi;;\n^ ^.-'^\nREVIEW.\nDr Josef Deutsch, Konnersreuth in drztlicher Beleuchtung, 8vo.\npp. 80.

Dr\nDeutsch is both a learned surgeon, who for some thirty years has\nbeen chief physician at the Trinity Hospital ofLippstadt (Westphalia),\nand a devout Roman Catholic. He is also, as is obvious from several\npassages, a profoundly believing Christian. And yet his attitude\ntowards Konnersreuth is one of undisguised scepticism.\nApparently he is no exception. For incidentally he tells us (p. 60)\nthat, as he can state authoritatively, all the Roman Catholic physi-\ncians (of Germany) \" with dwindling exceptions \" are either viewing\nKonnersreuth with very strong doubts, or reject it altogether. And\non p. 73 we read that in publishing his work\u2014^privately circulated at\nfirst\u2014he was moved exclusively by the apprehension that through\nKonnersreuth Roman Catholicism might some day find itself in a\nposition similar to the one it was once brought into by the Leo\nTaxil hoax. Such pronouncements are characteristic enough.\nDr Deutsch's very valuable work has appeared soon after it has\nbecome known that the Bavarian Bishops had decided to express to\nTherese Neumann their wish that she should submit to a scientific\ninvestigation in a University clinic\u2014^at least in a \" neutral \" clinic.\n^\nTo this very welcome decision the author refers in a Nachwort on\npp. 75-7. As was to be expected and quite rightly, he sees in it a\nsupport for his position on the part of high ecclesiastical authority.\nThe Bavarian Bishops' decision became known in Germany to the\ngeneral public through the daily press on 16 October. I am writing\nthese lines at the end of December and it is not yet ofiicially known\nwhat attitude the Neumann family have assumed towards the\nBishops' invitation. The information is rather contradictory and un-\ncertain, but in any case not satisfactory. Indeed Dr Deutsch even\nsays that he knows from an authoritative source that again Therese\n^ That is in a clinic not of exclusively religious character.\n260\n\fPART 130] Review 251\nNeiunaim's father has not consented to have his daughter placed\nunder observation. \" Apparently it is the same story as before. To\npeople who view one more investigation as necessary she (Theresa\nNeumann) will say, '\nYes ', but should the people be in earnest she\nseeks refuge behind her father's refusal \"\n(p. 76).\nIt must be admitted that such a circumstance is highly to be re-\ngretted, and Dr Deutsch is quite justified in saying that if Theresa\npersists in such an attitude (it should be added that she is thirty-\nfour !) she will be unable to prevent outsiders from interpreting it in\nan unfavourable sense. \" They will come to this conclusion : there\nis deception here, and the father who so obstinately refuses knows\nabout it \"\n(p. 76). As to which all sensible people will be of the same\nopinion.\nThe unwillingness of the Neumann family to have the matter\nproperly investigated is the more unpardonable since, as pointed out\nby Dr Deutsch, Therese's alleged abstinence from all food (barring a\nfraction of a Host every day) would, if genuine, be a marvel in com-\nparison with which the resurrection of Lazarus sinks into insignifi-\ncance. In the latter case a miracle occurred onlv once, the organs of\nthe dead Lazarus merely resuming their natural functions. In the\ncase of Therese, ostensibly living for years without partaking of any\nfood, a new miracle must take place day after day, hour after hour.\nAnd this violation of the laws of Nature such as the world has not\nyet seen could be made patent to every man of goodwill without\nmuch difficulty ! God's Almightiness could be demonstrated irre-\nfutably before millions of men !\n\" Why therefore does not this\nhappen ? Because Therese Neumann and her parents do not wish\nit and view such an ordeal as too hard \"\n(p. 65).\nWhy, on the other hand, should a new investigation take place\noutside of Konnersreuth ? Because, supposing Therese eats, drinks,\netc., notwithstanding her assertions to the contrary, \" it is impossible\nto keep the matter secret from the whole world without accomplices.\nThese possibly existing accomplices were not then^ under observa-\ntion and this is a serious flaw in the former investigation. Such a\nflaw can be eliminated only by remoidng Therese Neumann out of\nher environment \"\n(p. 69).\nWhilst entirely agreeing in this respect with the learned author I\nam ready to go one step farther and to suggest for our researches\none more canon of evidence formulated somewhat as follows : We\nmust bear in mind that with some people conviction beyond a certain\ndegree of intensity is apt to engender at least \" semi \"-complicity.\nTo generalise such a statement would be highly unintelligent and\n[Dr Deutsch has in view the sj'stematic observations carried out at Konners-\nreuth from 14 to 28 July 1927 by four Franciscan nuns. These observations\nwere very conscientiously made, but in the author's opinion inconclusive].\n\f252 Review [part\nunjust, but to ignore the possible existence of such a frame of mind\nand its consequences would be equally faulty and risky. Nor is there\nany reason to doubt that intensely religious people can be also subject\nto such a temptation\u2014and even occasionally yield to it.\nMeanwhile let us return to Dr Deutsch's work. It does not deal\neither with the stigmata or with the other alleged \" phenomena\n\"\nsuch as the erhobener Zustand, Therese Neumann's claim to act as\n\" the voice of Christ on earth \", and the like. These omissions are\ndue, it appears, to the fact that here \" it is not for the physician to\ndecide alone. Theology having also to say its weighty word \"\n(p. 73).\nSome people, of whom I am one, will regret the author's discretion,\nespecially with regard to the stigmata.\nUp to page 60 Dr Deutsch's book is devoted to a detailed disprov-\ning of the medical part of Herr Fritz Gerlich's work Die Stigrnatisierte\nvon Konnersreuth (Munich 1929). Here Herr Gerlich, who was a\nProtestant when he wrote the two volumes in question, but who has\nlong since been an enthusiastic believer in Konnersreuth, had\nattempted to show that in Therese there is no hysteria and that she\nhad in fact suffered before being \" miraculously \" cured from various\norganic lesions and troubles.\nHerr Gerlich, it should be added, is no physician. And his\ndiagnosis is mostly retrospective. Dr Deutsch systematically and\npitilessly demolishes it. Into the details of this process of demolition\nI need not go. Suffice it for my purpose to reproduce the following\nlines from p. 59 :\n\" In my opinion Gerlich's '\ndiagnosis '\nmay best be\nsummed up in the form of the following ' prescription '. Take a series\nof the biggest possible improbabihties, mix them up with this or that\nimpossibility, savour it all with vivid fancy and a few quotations and\nsqueeze it all in the form of preconceived opinion\u2014and here you\nhave a diagnostic which '\nwithout erroneous conclusion and without\nhypothesis '\nexplains everything directly by the law of cause and\neffect.\"\nThe case is still sub judice. But gradually the scales are being\nturned more and more against Konnersreuth and the Neumann\nclaims. In any case if the Bavarian Bishops' desire as to the stig-\nmatica being examined in a clinic is definitely not complied with,^\n^ If on the one hand no one can compel Therese Neumann and her family\nto comply with that wish, the Roman Catholic Church, as rightly pointed out\nby Dr Deutsch, has on the other sufficient means to prevent Konnersreuth\nfrom being henceforth looked upon as a place of pilgrimage. That Church\ncan forbid for instance, ecclesiastics such as Chaplain Fahsel to move from\none town to another preaching about Therese Neumann and attempting to\nidentify Konnersreuth and the Catholic faith, it can put an end to the pubh-\ncation of writings which \" under the cloak of piety \" represent all disbelievers\nin Konnersreuth as men without faith, bad Catholics, etc. \" It could finally\nleave Therese Neumann entirely to herself \"\n(p. 73).\n\f130] Review 253\npsychical researchers, I submit, will be most undoubtedly entitled to\nconclude that the Konnersreuth \" phenomena \" had better be left\nseverely alone. In which conclusion they are sure to be supported by\nseveral learned Roman Catholics, both priests and laymen, Dr\nDeutsch being one of the most prominent among them. We are\nhappy to see him in this protracted and tedious struggle between\ncreduUty and bigotry on one side and on the other the purely scien-\ntific standpoint\u2014which in this case at least is completely free from\nall anti-religious bias\u2014championing the cause of unmitigated Truth.\nP.-P.-S.\n\f\fREPORT OF A SERIES OF SITTINGS WITH RUDI\nSCHNEIDER.\n\u2022I. Introduction.\nBy Lord Charles Hope.\nThe following report is based on a series of experimental sittings\nheld with Rudi Schneider in London during October, November and\nDecember 1932.\nI had already been present at some thkty-five sittings with Schneider\nwhile he was employed by the National Laboratory of Psychical\nResearch in 1929-30 and early in 1932, and at three sittings in Paris\nin the autumn of 1930 at the Institut Metapsychique. In view of the\ninteresting report Les Pouvoirs inconnus de VEsprit sur la Matiere\nissued by Dr Osty (Director of the Institut Metapsychique of Paris)\nand his son M. Marcel Osty on experiments conducted by them with\nRudi Schneider in October 1930 to December 1932, I was anxious\nto arrange a series of sittings with this medium, and, if possible, to\nrepeat the absorption effects of infra-red rays noted by Osty as\ntaking place in Schneider's presence when he was in trance.\nAs one of the criticisms raised against Dr Osty's report has been\nhis omission to publish the names of most of the sitters present during\nhis experiments, the names of those present at the sittings mentioned\nin detail in this report will be found in the notes of the sittings.\nAs far as seemed possible, I got those people to help me whose\nchief interest lay in the question of whether or not the phenomena\nproduced in the presence of Rudi Schneider could be accepted as\ngenuine or not. By the term \" genuine \" I mean produced in some\nway other than by fraud. Unfortunately, as most people interested\nin this subject from a scientific point of view are extremely busy men,\nit was clearly impossible to make them responsible for the conduct\nof the experiments, but I was able to obtain competent assistance\nin the matter of the apparatus used at some of the sittings, and at\nall times I tried to coiiform to any suggestions made by responsible\npersons as to the control, etc. of the medium during the experiments.\nI was fortunate enough to enlist the interest of Lord Rayleigh in\nthe sittings and he kindly lent a considerable proportion of the\napparatus used for the experiments with infra-red rays, details of\nwhich are given in this report. Comments by Mr C. V. C. Herbert,\nLord Rayleigh, Professor Eraser-Harris, Dr William Brown, Mr\nC. C. L. Gregory, Mr Gerald Heard and Dr B. Wheeler Robinson,\nas to their impressions of the phenomena witnessed by them and the\np 255\n\f266 Lord Charles Hope [part\nconditions under which, these phenomena were produced, will be\nfound in this report.\nMy special thanks are due to the Dowager Lady Eayleigh, who\nvery kindly allowed her drawing-room to be used for sittings ; to\nMr C. V. C. Herbert, who made himself responsible for the smooth\nworking of the apparatus employed, a task entailing much time and\ntrouble ; to Captain the Hon. Victor Cochrane-Baillie, who made\nhimself responsible for taking the notes ; and to another friend of\nmine who bore a considerable share of the expenses entailed.\nThirteen sittings took place at 65 Cadogan Gardens, the residence\nof the Dowager Lady Eayleigh, and fourteen at 16 Queensberry\nPlace, in a smnce-room which I had hired exclusively from the London\nSpiritualist Alliance.\nIt was at first intended to hold as many sittings as possible at 65\nCadogan Gardens, but when I realised that the phenomena in\nquestion were becoming increasingly weak and sporadic I determined\nto see if a change of rooms would make any apparent difference.\nThe room at 16 Queensberry Place was considerably smaller and\nempty of superfluous furniture. What seemed more likely to help\nwas the psychological factor that the medium had given successful\nsittings in the same room on his fijst visit to London during 1929.\nThe first sitting was held at Queensberry Place because the other\nroom was not yet ready. The second to the tenth sittings held at\nCadogan Gardens were chiefly iitilised for experiments with photo-\ngraphy by infra-red rays. Although fairly frequent absorptions of\nthe ray were registered, nothing appeared on the plates. Possible\nexplanations of this are dealt with by Mr Herbert in his report.\nThe control of the medium, both manual and by means of muslin\nscreens, quite excluded the possibility of the medium having placed\nsome material object in the ray and withdrawn it before a photo-\ngraph could be taken. The effects on the photo-electric cell of the\nabsorptions of the rays sometimes persisted considerably longer than\nit took to expose the plates.\nAt no time had the medium access to either of the rooms used\nexcept while the sittings were being held, and he was then never left\nalone in the room.\nOn the whole, the phenomena noted were weaker and less frequent\nthan those reported as having taken place with the same medium\nelsewhere, but the results obtained go far to support the claims put\nforward by Dr Osty in his report. His experiments lasted fifteen\nmonths, whereas ours covered only eleven weeks.\nIt will be noted that at Cadogan Gardens fairly frequent absorp-\ntions in the infra-red rays were noted at most of the sittings held\nthere, whereas most of the movements of objects took place at\nQueensberry Place.\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 257\nAs may be seen in the table at p. 278, at only ten sittings out of a\ntotal of twenty-seven were both ray absorptions and movement of\nobjects noted. This includes three sittings at which the ray absorp-\ntions were very small and infrequent.\nAlthough it would be dangerous to jump to hasty conclusions in a\nquestion seemingly affected by so many dissimilar factors, the impres-\nsion given me was that the medium found it easier to achieve absorp-\ntions in the ray than the movement of objects. This supposition\nwas supported by his successes in ray absorptions when the muslin\npanels were in place between him and the ray, whereas under similar\nconditions no movements of objects took place. (N.B.\u2014Dr Osty\nreports that at some of his sittings objects were moved which had\nbeen placed behind muslin curtains.)\nAnother suggestion which may tentatively be made, judging\nfrom the results obtained, was that a success in. one direction usually\nended in a failure in the other. This, however, may have been\ncaused by the medium's apparent preference for success with\nmaterial objects rather than with the rays, and so lack of success\nwith the former may have led to more attention being paid to the\nlatter when his powers were at a low ebb or in some way misdirected.\nThe medium was always controlled by one of the sitters sitting\nopposite to him and holding him by the wrists or across the palms\nof his hands. The sitter immediately to the left of the controller,\nthe sub-controller, put his or her right hand on the medium's right\nhand or between his hands.\nThe controller placed his feet outside the medium's feet. Person-\nally, when controlling, I always placed my feet against the front legs\nof the medium's chair.\nThe remaining sitters joined hands, and the sitter on the exteme\nleft passed his hand across to the next sitter. The incident of the\nwhite light being shone during the sitting on 25 November was of\nspecial interest inasmuch that it happened accidentally. The effect\nwhich the white light apparently had upon the medium was con-\nsiderable, and the incident therefore enabled an experiment to be\nmade on him which otherwise would have been impossible without\nforfeiting the confidence of his trance personality, \" Olga.\" The\nsitters who by their positions adjacent to the medium were best\nable to judge of the sequence of events and the general effect on the\nmedium have made special mention of this in their reports.\nWhen the medium had regained his normal state he appeared not\nto know that anything unusual had occurred. He did not complain\nof feeling any ill effects either then or later. As far as I could judge\nfrom what was said by the medium just after the incident and at a\nsubsequent sitting \" Olga-Rudi \" seemed disposed to blame \" her-\nself \" more than us for the accident.\n\f258 Lord Charles Hope [part\nThe notes were always taken during the sittings (except when\notherwise stated), and are substantially as at first written down\n;\nbut small errors had sometimes to be corrected and these alterations,\ntogether with a copy of the notes of each sitting, were sent to most\nof the sitters as soon as possible after the sittings in question. A\nfew extra notes have been added by me from time to time, and these\nadditions are indicated in the report.\nA word must be added on the subject of the \" cold air \" and\n\" cold breezes \" frequently mentioned by the sitters and often\nreported in the notes. This phenomenon was not checked in any\nway, and indeed was impossible to check, but as the impression was\ncommon to all or nearly all the persons taking part in the sittings,\nit was duly mentioned in the notes. Although this feeling of \" cold\nair \" was more frequently remarked upon by those sitting near the\nmedium, that was not, by any means, always the case, and accidental\nmovements, cramped positions or the perception of the breath of\nthe sitters do not seem to be a sufficient explanation. Sometimes\none sitter after another would remark upon this sensation as though\nan area of cold air was passing along in front of the sitters. I do not\nremember anyone complaining of cold air roimd the back of his\nneck. On the whole, however, I am inclined to discount these\nsensations as being purely subjective, although worthy of mention.\nIt would be useless to attempt to judge of the effect, if any, that\nindividual sitters had on the production of phenomena. I think the\nevidence, such as it is, supports the theory that the medium alone\nsupplies all the \" force \" manifested by the movements of objects\nand the absorptions of infra-red rays. Such, however, I believe, was\nnot the opinion held by the medium, who, both when normal and in\ntrance, seemed to think the sitters played an important part in the\nproduction of the necessary \" force.\" The medium, while in trance,\nmade almost continuous movements with his fingers along the arms\nand legs of the controller and arm of the sub-controller, presumably\nto gather this \" force.\" Towards the end of each sitting a contrary\nmovement was made of giving back the \" force \" supposed to have\nbeen collected from the sitters.\nAs the question has been raised with regard to the presence of\nFraulein Mangl at the sittings given by Rudi, her fiance, it is as well\nto point out that she attended only eight out of the total of twenty-\nseven, including the special sitting of 25 November, to which no\nevidential value was attached. Also, although we had no specific\nreason for suspecting her we always bore in mind the possibility that\nshe might try to help out the phenomena, and took suitable pre-\ncautions. Neither she nor Rudi ever showed any desire that she\nshould be invited to the sittings.\nSince the results being obtained were not as frequent as I had\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 259\nhoped for, I refrained from varying the controllers more than seemed\nnecessary, as in my previous experience of the medmm it had seemed\nto me that new controllers tended to upset him for a time or two.\n\" Olga-Kudi \" at times showed an inclination to blame certain\nsitters for the lack of phenomena, but I think it was nierely their\npresence at poor or negative sittings that associated them in the\nmedium's mind with failure on his part.\nTowards the end of the series of sittings I did not introduce any\nfresh sitters, and for the last three sittings I had intended to ask only\nthose sitters who had, either at this or at previous series of sittings,\nwitnessed especially strong phenomena. For two sittings this plan\nwas adhered to, but without any apparent benefit. Then the sequence\nwas broken by \" Olga-Kudi\n\"\n's demand for an extra sitting, to which\nall the sitters were unable to come. The conditions necessary for the\nproduction of strong and frequent phenomena seemed as elusive to\n\" Olga-Kudi \" as they were mysterious to us.\n. t.\n\u2022\nr\nIt may be useful if I add a brief note on the principles of the infra-\nred apparatus used during these sittings. The visible spectrum\nends with red, but beyond it\n\" light \" continues into the mfra-red.\nThe infra-red wave-lengths, though they produce no visible hght,\nand thus are apparently less harmful to the medium and his \" powers,\"\nare capable of being detected by appropriate apparatus, such as a\nphoto-electric cell. Therefore, if a beam of infra-red hght is directed\nat such a cell and if the cell is connected with a recording apparatus,\nit is possible to measure the amount of infra-red light that reaches\nthe cell. This, again, makes it possible to detect any interruption\n(absorption) of the infra-red beam. It is on this principle that the\ninfra-red apparatus is based.\nII. Individual Reports.\n1. By C. V. C. Herbert, B.A., F.R.A.S.\nDuring the autumn and winter of 1932 I assisted at a series of\nexperiments with the Austrian medium, Rudi Schneider. These\nexperiments were carried out by Lord Charles Hope, who had asked\nme to be responsible for the scientific part of the work as regards its\nphysical aspect. The experiments were undertaken under consider-\nable difficulties, chief among which were the following: lack of\nexperience ^\n; lack of workshop facilities and skilled assistance ;\nlack of funds. As regards the first, I feel confident that much better\nresults could be obtained in any future work in the light of the\n1 This only apphed to the scientific side : Lord Charles Hope has had\nconsiderable experience in the general conduct of sittings.\n\f260 Lord Charles Hope [part\nknowledge acquired during these experiments. The second difl&-\nculty was a very real one. Anyone used to laboratory work knows\nthe troubles and waste of time inherent in the use of improvised\napparatus, particularly in the dark. We could not try many of the\nexperiments we would have wished owing to lack of apparatus,\nwhich the third difficulty prevented us from buying or having made.\nIn spite of the generosity of many friends, little money was available\nfor the purchase of apparatus, and though we are deeply indebted\nto various individuals and institutions who lent us instruments, it\nwas impossible to borrow all that we needed. Nor with our other\nactivities were we able to devote as much time to the work as we\nwould have wished. It is hoped that we have again demonstrated that\nthe subject is a sufficiently important one for future experiments to\nbe carried out under conditions in which these obstacles are removed.\nBefore the beginning of the present series of experiments, I had\nhad a number of sittings ^ with Rudi Schneider, at some of which I\nhad used an infra-red absorption apparatus, which had been specially\ndesigned to exclude as far as possible the possibility of mechanical\nfraud. Rather to my surprise, the instrument showed unmistakable\nabsorptions of the beam on the very first evening that it was used.\nSchneider had had no opportunity of examining the apparatus\nbefore the sitting, nor had he any clear idea of its construction.^\nWith these apparatus I noticed, independently of Dr Osty of Paris,\nthat the effect on the beam was at times oscillatory, having a fre-\nquency of twice that of the subject's respiratory period.^\nThe experiments now to be considered were started with a view to\nobtaining direct photographs of Osty's substance invisible,'^ by means\nof an apparatus designed and constructed by Lord Rayleigh, who\nvery kindly lent the apparatus and superintended its erection and\nuse. Lord Rayleigh has already described his apparatus,^ and the\nreader is referred to his paper for the details of its construction.\nHere it will suffice to say that the method used is \" instantaneous\n\"\nsilhouette photography by infra-red radiation, a photo-electric\narrangement being used to show when the occultations of the beam\nare taking place. Ilford infra-red plates are used in conjunction\nwith a filter of cobalt glass.

The substance invisible was invisible still. These\napparently paradoxical results can probably be explained by the\nfact that the plate and the photo-electric cell were not accurately\nmatched as regards their frequency response characteristics. It\nhad been hoped that large deflections would be recorded, corres-\nponding to a diminution of the total radiation of the beam of 50%\nor more. Had this occurred, it would have been impossible for the\nocculting substance to escape detection by the plate. Unfortunately,\nno large deflections were obtained : and it must be assumed that\n7000 8000 9000 10000\nANGSTROMS\nA. Cell and Tilter. B. Plate and Filter.\nFig. 1. \u2014Rayleigh Apparatus : Response Curves.\nthose corresponding to the photographs taken were caused by the\nabsorption of the longer wave-lengths of the relative spectrum, to\nwhich the plate was comparatively insensitive. Thus it was\ncomputed that a complete cut off of the wave-lengths over 9000\nAngstroms would have reduced the output from the cell by 25%,\nwhile only reducing the effect on the plate by 2% (see fig. 1). The\nfigures are approximate only. A body of large area, absorbing only\nthe longer wave-lengths, might well have caused a considerable\ngalvanometer deflection, while producing so faint an image on the\nplate as to be invisible.\nThe experiments thus tended to show that the diminution in the\nintensity of the infra-red beam was due to the absorption of the\nlonger wave-lengths only.^ They also indicated that the absorptions\nwere not due to mechanical fraud.\n^ Cp. Osty, op. cit., p. 84.\n\f262 Lord Charles Hope [part\nThe general arrangement of tlie apparatus was as follows (see\nPlate I) : tlie sources and filter were contained in a box screwed to a\nrigid table ; a similar table, placed 12 feet away, beld the camera\nand cell, wbicli were also screwed down. The large lens, 12 inches\nin diameter and of 3 feet focal length, was held in a wooden mount,\nscrewed to a smaller table, placed midway between the source and\nthe camera. All three tables were screwed to the floor of the labora-\ntory. An artificial flower was placed close to the large lens, on the\ncamera side, and the medium was asked to concentrate the \" force\n\"\nabove the flower. The wires from the cell were led to a light-proof\ncabinet, containing the galvanometer and illuminating apparatus,\nand also, in most of the experiments, a drum camera for obtaining a\nrecord of the deflections on a strip of sensitised paper. An observer\nin the cabinet signalled to the operator at the infra-red camera when\na deflection took place. Later, a pneumatic release was employed,\nso that the exposure could be made by the observer at the galvano-\nmeter. The camera operator had then only to change the plates,\nwhich he did at a signal from the observer that a photograph had\nbeen taken. When the plate was changed, the operator signalled\nback that all was ready for another exposure.^ The galvanometer\nused had a quick period, so that the danger of the occulting sub-\nstance escaping before the photograph was taken was not great.\nNo trouble was experienced in the use of the apparatus, and a large\nnumber of plates were taken.\nIn order to increase the spectrum range into the longer infra-red,\na few exposures were made on the new Eastman plates sensitised\nwith xenocyanin, in conjunction with a dyed gelatine filter supplied by\nthe Eadiovisor Company. The same cell was used. The sensitivity\ncurve of this plate and filter went deeper into the intra-red than that\nof the cell. These plates were, unfortunately, much slower than the\nIlford plates, and had the disadvantage ofrequiring supersensitisation\nbefore use, and of having to be stored on ice. The exposure was in-\ncreased from 1\/lOOth or l\/25th of a second to l\/5th or 1\/2 of a second.\nUnfortunately, owing to some defect in the emulsion, the negatives\nwere so covered with spots and blotches that it was impossible to tell if\nthere was any image or not. A second batch of plates, said to be free\nfrom this defect, did not arrive in time for use in the experiments.\nAfter the failure of the Eastman plates, all attempts with the\nRayleigh apparatus were abandoned, and we concentrated on\nobtaining graphical records of the infra-red absorptions, and on\nexperiments in telekinesis. Up till this time, the work had been\ncarried out in a room at no. 65 Cadogan Gardens, kindly lent by the\nDowager Lady Rayleigh ; but at this stage, a move was made to a\n^ The signalling was carried out by means of small red lamps controlled\nby bell pushes.\n\fPLATE I.\nThe ]Medium's Cage, and the Muslin Screen ; the hitter shown raised\nto give access to the \" Cabinet and apparatus.\n\fPLATE II.\nInterior of Oalvanomctcr Caljinet at Ki (^ucen.sberry Place.

This new laboratory was set up in one of the seance-\nrooms at the London Spiritualist Alliance, 16 Queensberry Place. It\nmay be objected that a scientific investigation should not have been\ncarried out in a spiritualistic institution ; but against this it must be\nsaid that the room was hired by us for the full period of the experi-\nments, that we had the charge of the only key, and that the room\nwas inspected by a firm of builders ^ and was pronoimced to be free\nfrom trap-doors, etc. Schneider was not allowed into the room\nexcept during the sittings, and was never left alone in it. This room\nmade a very convenient laboratory, and adjoining it there was a\nwell-fitted dark-room for the development of the galvanometer\nrecords, etc. The arrangements were similar to those at Cadogan\nGardens. A light-proof cabmet was built to hold the galvanometers\nand apparatus, and the wiring was installed on a more permanent\nfooting than had been possible before (see Plate II).\nThe great disadvantage of this laboratory was that it was ex-\ntremely susceptible to mechanical vibration.^ To overcome this,\nthe galvanometers were mounted on a heavy lead table, supported\non rubber sponges. The iafra-red projector and cell were also\nmounted on sponges ; but even when this had been done, trouble\nwas sometimes experienced from vibration.\nThe apparatus most often used in this laboratory was a battery-\ndriven projector with a dyed gelatine filter,^ transmitting a beam\non to a caesium-on-silver cell.* The projector and cell were mounted\non blocks, screwed to a board, standing on rubber sponges. The\nleads from the cell to the galvanometer cabinet were run in an\nearthed lead-covered cable. The leads supplying the projector\nwere run along the ceiling of the room. The current for the projector,\ngalvanometer field, etc. was obtained from a battery of motor-car\naccumulators contained in the galvanometer cabinet. The cell could\nbe connected directly to a galvanometer and battery, or the out-\nput could be fed to a thermionic amplifier. This was of a tyjDe de-\nsigned by me for stellar photometry,^ and consisted of an arrange-\nment of paired triodes. Considerable amplification of the photo-\nelectric current was obtainable, and the apparatus was stable\nenough for use in conjunction with a sensitive galvanometer. Good\nresults had been obtained with this instrument at Cadogan Gardens ;\n1 Messrs White and Johnson, Ltd., whose report can be inspected, on\nappUcation, at the Rooms of the Society.\n^ The room was at the top of the house, which was situated close to streets\ncarrying heavy traffic. It was also above the lines of the Underground\nrailway.\n* Supplied by the Radiovisor Company\n* Type CM, General Electric Company\n5 British Patent no. 373622, 1931.\n\f264 Lord Charles Hope [part\nbut at Queensberry Place, owing to the residual vibration in the\nlaboratory, it was impossible to use it at anything like full sensitivity.\nFor this reason, the direct coupling of the cell to the galvanometer\nwas generally preferred. The galvanometer most used was a moving-\ncoil instrument of the Moll type, made by the Cambridge Instrument\nCompany.1 Its period was 1-3 seconds. It was used with a damping\nresistance, and its sensitivity could be varied by means of a shunt-\nbox. A Tinsley moving coil was sometimes used.^ This was more\nsensitive than the Moll, but had a much slower period.\nThe infra-red beam could be completely enclosed by means of\nalternative wooden frameworks, covered with string netting or fine\nmuslin (see Plate III). The cell was moimted in a small box, with\na window of red glass, to absorb the luminosity from the cell.^\nRecords of the movements of the galvanometer were obtained with\nthe drum camera.* The times at which the drum was started and\nstopped were noted, so that the exact times of any absorptions could\nbe computed by measuring the record. The paper moved at a speed of\n12 inches an hour, which was fast enough for the Moll galvanometer.\nAnother instrument occasionally used was the original enclosed\ninfra-red apparatus,^ mentioned at the beginning of this paper. It\nconsisted of a box, covered with fine muslin, and furnished with a\ntightly-fitting, muslin-covered lid. Inside were a battery-driven\nprojector, and a selenium cell and single-stage amplifier. The\nlatter fed a milliamperemeter, and also a relay, working an electric\nbell. The whole apparatus, including the bell, relay and all batteries\n(but with the exception of the meter), was contained in the box.\nThe circuit was arranged to exclude the effect of temperature on the\ncell. By carefully controlling the leads to the meter, it was assured\nthat the apparatus could not be influenced, except by occulting the\nbeam. The apparatus was once used at Queensberry Place,^ when\nsmall deflections of the meter were noted ; but the movement was\nnot sufiicient to ring the bell.' The deflections were, however, greater\nthan could have been produced by inserting a wire through the\nmuslin. The lid was sealed on, and the muslin was carefully ex-\namined by me, before and after the sitting, and was found to be\nfree from pimctures. The observers are confident that no attempt\n^ Kindly lent by the Imperial College of Science.\n^ Kindly lent by Lord Rayleigh.\n^ Tbe luminosity was very noticeable in the dark.

The box\nwas placed under a faint red lamp, so that the white surface of the\nmuslin was visible throughout the experiment. In my opinion, the\ndeflections were imdoubtedly produced by the medium by\nparanormal means. The apparatus was also once used at Cadogan\nGardens, but on this occasion the lid was removed from the box.\nThe box was, however, so placed that it was impossible for the black\ncurtains of the\n'\n' cabinet\n'\n' to enter the path of the ray. Considerable\ndeflections were noted, and the bell rang twice. Vibratory move-\nments of the needle were also observed, having a period of twice that\nof the medium's breathing.^\nIn addition to the above, other appliances were used ;\nfor example,\na projector consisting of a low-temperature source and a thermopile\ndetector. It was designed by Lord Rayleigh, who kindly lent the\nnecessary apparatus. The source was an electrically heated flat-\niron, whose radiation was received by a Moll thermopile ^ connected\nto a small reflecting galvanometer.^ No deflections were observed.\nThe medium complained that the heat from the iron inhibited the\nphenomena, and asked that the apparatus should not be used again.\nA second photographic apparatus was also tried at Queensberry\nPlace, since there was not enough space in this laboratory for the\nRayleigh apparatus. It consisted of a low-voltage lamp with a small\nbunched filament, which transmitted a beam on to an Ilford plate,\nprotected by a focal plane shutter. A dyed gelatine filter was used.\nThe method of use was as follows : a small artificial flower was\nplaced as near the plate as possible, and the medium was asked to\nconcentrate the \" force \" above the flower. The projector was\nturned off, and the shutter opened. The photograph was taken by\nswitching the current to the lamp on and off by means of a key, at a\nsignal from the medium that the \" force \" was in position. The\ndefinition with this camera was not so good as with the Rayleigh\napparatus, but trial exposure of fingers held above the flower gave\nquite good images. Only a few plates were taken, and though one\nshowed a faint marking, it was not considered definite enough for\nserious consideration. The others were complete blanks.\nResults.\nHaving reviewed the instrumental equipment, it will now be\nconvenient to consider the results obtained. The infra-red photo-\n^\nCp. Osty, op. cit.

Those made with the Rayleigh apparatus are not very\nsatisfactory ; as owing to the projector being fed from the electric\nmains,^ the voltage of which was continually fluctuating, the path\ntraced by the spot of light is very irregular. But when observing\nthe deflections taking place, it was very easy to differentiate be-\ntween the comparatively slow up and down movements due to the\nvoltage fluctuation, and the quick downward movements due to\noccidtation of the beam.\"^ On the record, however, the occultation\nmovements are somewhat masked by the fluctuations. It is quite\neasy to distinguish the larger occultations ; but the general ap-\npearance of the record is not very good. With the later apparatus,\na battery-driven projector was used, and the occultations stand out\nclearly from a perfectly straight line of zero absorption. Occasion-\nally the apparatus was affected by mechanical vibration, chiefly\nowing to the subsidence of the rubber sponges under the baseboard\nof the projector and cell ; but movements due to this source were\nalways easily detectable, being of a totally different character from\nthe occultation movements. An excellent safeguard against vibra-\ntion movements being mistaken for occultations existed in the fact\nthat the medium, in recovering from his hypnotic condition, strug-\ngled violently\u2014so much so that the whole room was shaken. If any\nmovement of the spot occurred during this period, the record was dis-\ncarded. Out of a total of sixty-eight strips, only three were rejected\nfor vibration ; and on each of these occasions, it was found that the\nrubber sponges under the apparatus had subsided, so that the base-\nboard was making contact with the floor. Mechanical vibrations\nalso affected the suspension of the galvanometer, causing it to vibrate\nvery quickly. The only result of this was a slight thickening of the\nline on the paper, the thickening being symmetrical about the line.\nThe movements were very frequent,^ but were of small amplitude\nand did not interfere in any way.\nIn Plate IV is reproduced a portion of one of the records obtained\non 6 December. The projector and cell were protected by a closely-\nfitting muslin cage, which completely enclosed the beam. The\napparatus is shown in Plate III. It was placed in front of the cur-\ntains of the \" cabinet,\" with the projector end nearest to Schneider,\n1 The 200 volt D.C. lighting mains were used, the projector lamps being fed\nthrough a resistance.\n^ With the Rayleigh apparatus, the absorptions caused movements of the\nspot from left to right : with the other apparatus from right to left ; one\npaper moved downwards.\n* Thoy were probably caused by the passing of the trains on the Under-\nground railway.\n\fPLATE IV.\nPortion of Galvanometer Record obtained at the sitting of 6 December\n1932.

It will be seen that the occultations were predicted by the\nmedium. The last movement, which is the largest, represents an\nabsorption of 8% of the total intensity of the beam.\nThis record is typical of most of those obtained ;\nthe absorptions\nbeing generally of about the same order of magnitude. At an earlier\nsitting,^ however, very large occultations were observed, reaching a\nmaximum of 80% of the total intensity of the beam (see Plate V).\nThe apparatus used was not provided with a protective cover, and I\n^ In the order in which they sat, the first being nearest the medium.\n2 The medium spoke in German.

[part\nthought that the curtains of the cabinet had been introduced into\nthe beam by the \" force.\" In order to test this, at the next sitting ^\nan arrangement of threads was stretched across between the appara-\ntus and the curtains. The galvanometer record obtained is shown\nin Plate VI. At first, only small movements were recorded ; but\neventually the spot rose to a position of 78% absorption. Instead,\nhowever, of returning to zero absorption, it only fell to 68%, where it\nremained steady. It was obvious that the curtain had entered the\nbeam, and had become entangled in the threads. Then followed\nseveral attempts by the medium to get the curtain out again. The\nspot fell to 36% and then rose to 64%, where it remained steady.\nThen it fell suddenly to 30% and came to rest at 60%. A little\nlater there was another downward movement, after which the spot\nrose again to 60%. Finally, a small table, standing near the curtains,\nwas violently upset, and, in falling, dislodged the thread that had\nbeen holding the curtain. ^ During this performance, the medium\nwas asked if any object had been introduced into the ray, and the\nreply was that the absorptions were due to the \" power \" alone.^\nAs regards most of the telekinetic phenomena, it is undesirable\nfor me to enter into a discussion, as I was generally stationed in the\ngalvanometer cabinet, and was thus not an actual observer of the\nmovement of objects. On one occasion, however, an excellent\ntelekinesis took place when I was one of the sitters.* I was seated\ndirectly opposite the red lamp, which illuminated a small table, on\nwhich were placed the objects to be moved. The order of the sitters\nwas as follows : Professor Fraser-Harris and Mrs Fraser-Harris (both\nholding Schneider), Miss Reutiner, Mr C. C. L. Gregory, Lady\nCrosfield, Mr Herbert, The Hon. A. C. Strutt, Mrs P. Quilter, Lord\nCharles Hope ;\nCaptain the Hon. Victor Cochrane-Baillie was taking\nthe notes. The small table was heard to move slightly , and eventually\nfell over, coming to rest on its side, with one edge of the top on my\nright toe. The legs were pointing towards the \" cabinet.\" At this\nstage, the red lamp was turned up, so that the table was clearly\nvisible. While I was watching it intently, it rose off my toes and then\ndescended on to them again. The total movement was of the order\nof two inches. A little later this movement was repeated. During\nboth these movements, I could see all four legs very clearly, and I\n1 25 November 1932.\n^ The table, in falling, dislodged the filter of the projector, and allowed the\nescape of white Ught. This brought the sitting to an abrupt end, as the\nmedium had fallen off his chair.\n^ The medium, when in the hypnotic state, is incHned to be deceitful. His\nnormal character is unusually open and honest. It must be understood,\nhowever, that the movements both of the curtains and of the table were\ncaused by paranormal means. The medium was held throughout.\n4 11 November 1932.\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 269\nam positive that nothing touched the table on the \" cabinet \" side.\nIt might have been possible to raise the table by an arrangement of\nfine black threads placed romid the legs ; but as the movement was\na vertical one, this would have involved the existence of some sort\nof pulley fixed above the table. Such machinery was out of the\nquestion, as it would have been impossible to fix it up and remove it\nagain during the sitting.^ There can have been nothing in the nature\nof an extending rod, held by Schneider, such as is sometimes used by\nfraudulent mediums, as, apart from the fact that Schneider was held\nby Professor and Mrs Fraser-Harris, such a structure must have\nbeen visible to me. Nor was there anything corresponding to the so-\ncalled ectoplasm, described by some investigators. Granting the\nintegrity of the sitters on my left and right hand, it seems to me\nimpossible that the table could have been moved by normal means.\nThe abnormally quick breathing of the medium during his hyp-\nnotic state is a phenomenon to be discussed by physiologists ; but I\nwould mention that at our request gramophone records were made of\nthis by the Gramophone Company, Ltd. Two records were prepared\nat a special sitting held at the Company's studios.^ I was present\nin the recording-room during the making of the records, and can\ntestify that the breathing recorded was typical of that which occurs\nthroughout Schneider's hypnotic state.\nIn conclusion, I would wish to express my very best thanks to all\nthose who assisted me with the experiments. To Professor Pollard\nfor the loan of the Moll galvanometer ; to Lord Rayleigh for the\nloan of a great deal of valuable apparatus, and for much active help\nin the experiments ; and last, but by no means least, to my friend\nRudi Schneider, who cheerfully submitted to all our tests and who\nbore without complaint all the indignities of being investigated by\nsuspicious scientists.\n2. By Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S.\nMr Herbert has already given an adequate account of those parts\nof the investigation with which I was specially connected. I add\none or two remarks.\nThe apparatus for infra-red photography was not well adapted\nfor making records of galvanometer deflections : for the large area\nof the lens can only be blocked by a large object : and if the absorbing\nagency is of restricted linear dimensions, the change of deflection\n1 Schneider was searched after the sitting by Professor Fraser-Harris and\nLord Charles Hope. Nothing suspicious was found.\n^ Copies of one of these records are obtainable on apphcation to the Secretary\nof the Society.\n\f270 Lord Charles Hope [part\nwill only be a small fraction of the whole deflection, and therefore\ndifficult to distinguish from accidental disturbances. The photo-\nelectric arrangements which formed part of this apparatus were in\nfact designed for the quite different purpose of giving an indication\nof when a photograph should be attempted.\nNone of the photographs gave the slightest indication that a\ndefined object was interposed. This may be due, as Mr Herbert\nsupposes, to the fact that the photo-electric cell is sensitive further\ninto the infra-red than the plate, and that the absorption occurs only\nin this further infra-red region. But two other possibilities remain\nopen, which I am inclined to favour. It is possible that the obstruct-\ning agency was in for so short a time on these occasions that it was\nnot caught on the photograph : I have verified by special tests that\nthis is a feasible explanation, it being possible to cause a movement\nof the galvanometer by a movement of the hand across the beam,\nso rapid that it cannot be caught within the \" reaction time \" of\nthe photographer. Lord Charles Hope thinks that some of the\ndeflections were too prolonged for this explanation to hold. He may\nbe right, but on the occasions when I was taking infra-red plates, the\nrecording drum was not yet in use, and we had nothing but the signals\nfrom the observer at the galvanometer. Alternatively, the unknown\nobstructing agent may be of such ill-defined outline that there is\nnothing definite to be photographed.\nIn any further experiments on these lines, an automatic release\nby amplifying devices should be tried. With the time and resources\navailable it was not possible for us to arrange this.\nOn the general arrangements for the experiments, it should be\nremarked that the amomit of light allowed was too small to be of any\npractical use, at least to me : though it may have been otherwise\nwith some of the younger observers. It was necessary therefore to\ndepend entirely upon the controller. A good deal has been said at\ndiff'erent times about Schneider being able to release a hand for the\nfraudulent production of the phenomena. Even if there is evidence\nthat he has occasionally done this, I confess it seems to me absurd to\nargue as if a man with each hand or arm firmly grasped by a hand\nof a trustworthy controller in the prime of life might be regarded as\nvirtually free.\nOn one occasion when I was present there was a movement of the\ncurtains, as evidenced by the noise of the bells attached to them.\nNo one was there on that occasion whom I could regard as a possible\nconfederate of the medium. Apart from this I was not fortunate\nenough to see anything of the telekinetic phenomena.\nThe rapid and noisy breathing of the medium is a most striking\nphenomenon in itself. I am quite unable to imitate it for more than\na very short period.\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 271\nIn conclusion, I regard this purely as an experimental researcli of\na difficult and laborious kind. Owing to practical obstacles, it is\nhard to get results as well established as in other branches of inves-\ntigation, or to make such rapid progress. The more need for patience\nand perseverance, and for the avoidance of dogmatism.\n3. By D. F. Fraser-Harris, M.D., D.Sc. (Lond.), F.R.S.E.\nThrough the kindness of Lord Charles Hope I was privileged to\nbe one of a number of sitters in a series of twenty-seven sittings, at\nnineteen of which I was able to be present.\nThe general impression I received was that my fellow workers\nwere not so much concerned with spectacular experiences as with\ninvestigating any phenomena which might occur in the course of\nstrictly scientific experimentation. I was particularly impressed\nwith the thoroughness of the precautions taken against fraud or\nlegerdemain. Those responsible for the technical arrangements\u2014\n\u2022\nLord Charles Hope and Mr C. V. C. Herbert\u2014^seemed to have antici-\npated every possible source of fraud.\nThus in Cadogan Gardens on five occasions the medium and con-\ntroller were seated inside a specially constructed cage of wood and\nmuslin, so that the medium was isolated both from the region of the\napparatus and from the circle of sitters.\nFurther, on several occasions, the path of the infra-red rays was\nencased in a rectangular framework completely preventing any\nvoluntary or accidental himian interference with the rays. Several\ntimes the whole space occupied by the curtains and the apparatus\nwas screened off from the medium and the circle by panels of muslin\nfixed to wooden supports.\nI understood from Lord Charles Hope that the main object of these\ninvestigations was to confirm, and if possible extend, the results first\nobtained by Dr Eugene Osty with the infra-red rays in the experi-\nments in Paris, October 1930 to December 1931. I was told that\nphotography by the infra-red rays was to be attempted, being carried\nout in conjunction with a photo-electric cell and a galvanometer.\nI leave it to those skilled in this very recently developed branch\nof physics to speak of the disposition of the infra-red apparatus, but\nas one who has used the galvanometer extensively in physiological\nwork, I should like to emphasise the scientific value of our having\nobtained permanent photographic records by means of that instru-\nment.\nWhat interested me as a physiologist was the very fast respiration\n(hyperpnoea) of the medium in trance. Respiratory movements\nhaving a frequency of all the following rates per minute were\nQ\n\f272 Lord Charles Hope [part\ncounted\u201475, 104, 108, 111, 115, 120, 136, 155 up to a maximum of\n240.\nIt is very satisfactory to know that througli Lord Charles's enter-\nprise, a gramophone record of this remarkable type of breathing was\nobtained on two twelve-inch records. I am inclined to think that\nthis peculiar shallow though rapid breathing is of the type called\n\" superior costal.\" I am doubtful whether the diaphragm itself\nrises and falls at the very fast rates just referred to. One would\nhave supposed this hyperpnoea, kept up as Rudi was able to do it,\nat times for an hour or more, would have been fatiguing, but we\ncould detect no evidence that this was so.\nI was controller throughout seven sittings, and in the eighth\nduring only the latter portion.\nWhat struck me most in that position was the ceaseless muscular\nefforts which the medium was making. He convulsed as many\nmuscles as possible, contorted his body, threw himself first to one\nside and then to the other, writhed, groaned, pinched the knees of\nthe controller and the arm of the sub-controller in his intense efforts\nto maintain muscular activity at a maximum. On ruore than one\noccasion when my wife was sub-controller her right arm was black\nand blue.\nOne decidedly interesting thing we noticed was that just before\nsome distinct levitation or telekinesis was about to be produced,\nRudi replaced these very energetic muscular movements by what\nwe came to call \" light plucking.\" This manoeuvre consisted in his\nceasing to \" draw power \" (see later) and in his adopting a particu-\nlarly gentle style of either making light \" passes \" over the sub-\ncontroller's elbow or of plucking at it in the gentlest way possible.\nMy wife and I particularly noticed that this technique had taken the\nplace of the usual vigorous \" drawing power \" a few seconds before\nthe violent telekinesis of 25 November occurred.\nThe expression \" drawing power \" refers to Rudi's stroking one of\nthe arms of the controller or of the sub-controller or a little of both.\nThese stroking movements he can keep up as long as a sitting lasts.\nThe stroking is always from shoulder to wrist. The reverse movement\nis called \" giving back power.\" These movements he performs with\nhis left hand, because that is the one free from the wrist, his right\nhand being grasped by the right hand of the sub-controller.\nMrs Fraser-Harris, who was sub-controller on many occasions, and\nfrequently by request of \" Olga \" through the medium in trance,\ndeclares that at no time during the \" drawing power \" was she\nconscious of any power being taken out of her, nor of any power\nbeing restored when \" giving back power \" was proceeded with.\n\" Olga-Rudi\n\"\n's very frequent request for the sitters to sing and to\nbe \" lustig \" should be referred to here. Being \" lustig \" could not\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 273\nmean more than talking brightly. This was sometimes decidedly\ndifl&cult, for after one had been sitting four hours or so in the dark\nevery topic that was not inappropriately serious had long before been\nexhausted.\nThe criticism that has been made that this singing was for the\npurpose of withdrawing our attention from the medium's \" tricks\n\"\nwould have some weight if any \" tricks \" had ever been proved to\nhave been done ; but none have been.\nOf less spectacular telekinetic phenomena I observed the follow-\ning : movements of the curtains (seen and also heard by the bells\nringing) ; movements of the table (only heard) ; movements of the\nzither (only heard) ; one movement of the paper-basket, when it\nseemed to be impelled forward and strike Lord Charles Hope's right\nknee and afterwards roll on the floor between his and IMrs Fraser-\nHarris's feet.\nOur most remarkable experience should be related here. It was\nat the close of the sitting of 25 November 1932, the sixteenth of the\nseries, when I was controller and my wife sub-controller. \" Olga-\nRudi \" had said the force was strong, and the medium was exerting\nhimself to a maximum when we noticed that he had changed his\ndrawing power from the vigorous stroking to the light plucking\nmovement already described.\nAll of a sudden and without any warning, the right-hand curtain,\nwith its bells ringing, was impelled forcibly outwards. Hardly had\nwe reaUsed what had taken place, for the curtain seemed to remain\nblown out, than there was a loud noise followed by the appearance\nof some white light low down to the left of the medium as we faced\nhim.\nIn another instant the medium, as though impelled by a force\nacting between his shoulder blades, fell off his chair sideways towards\nhis own right and lay panting on the floor between the feet of the\nsitters and the muslin frame. My wife at once felt for his wrist, and\nascertained that the heart was satisfactory. With Mr Gregory's\nassistance, I immediately covered his head with the black cloth\nkept in readiness to protect the medium's eyes from light in the\nevent of just such an accident. During the time the medium lay\non the floor, he was not breathing at the rapid rate characteristic of\nhis trance state, but neither could he be called normal. By degrees\nwe raised Rudi on to his chair, where the hyperpnoea was resumed\nuntil in due time he came out of trance, but we noted that this pro-\ncess occupied a very much longer time than usual and was performed\nin about twice as many stages. On recovering consciousness, Rudi\ndeclared himself quite unaware of what had happened and would\nnot admit that he was any the worse for the accident. I visited him\nnext morning and confirmed this. When the lights were switched\n\f274 Lord Charles Hope [part\non, it was found that the table had been turned upside down\nthrough 180\u00b0. In falling over, it had detached the filter over the\nsource of the rays and so exposed some white light.\n4. By Professor A. F. C. Pollard, A.E.C.S., F.Inst.P., A.M.I.E.B.\nBy the kind invitation of Lord Charles Hope I was able to attend\neight out of the twenty-seven sittings with Eudi, and at five of these\nI controlled him.\nOn all those occasions the infra-red apparatus was in operation,\nand at several sittings apparatus was set up to secure infra-red\nshadow photographs of any absorbing matter which might appear in\nthe beam affecting the photo-electric cell.\nOn nearly every occasion many movements of the galvanometer\ncoil were recorded, but no evidence of light absorbing matter was\nafforded by the photographs which were taken by an operator\nimmediately after many of these movements.\nFrom the curves of photo-electric cell and photographic plate\nsensitivity, described elsewhere by Mr Herbert, it is apparent that\nan interposed \" substance \" affecting the galvanometer circuit\nwould not necessarily cast a shadow on the photographic plate. It\nis important to remember this, as otherwise the results obtained are\nincompatible.\nThese movements of the galvanometer coil, which confirm Dr\nOsty's discovery, are very remarkable and of greater scientific\nvalue than the telekinetic phenomena, which in the present series\nof sittings have not been instrumentally recorded.\nIn addition, as elsewhere described, the bell in series with a\nselenium cell rang on two or three occasions, indicating an absorp-\ntion of at least 50% of the infra-red radiation.\nWhatever it is that affects the galvanometer or bell circuits appears\nto emanate from Rudi, since the ray absorption sometimes syn-\nchronised with his breathing and sometimes took place immediately\nafter he said it would. But this was by no means always the case.\nIt would require a somewhat tedious and lengthy statistical study\nwith more detailed observations to demonstrate a correlation between\nthese events. On one occasion while I was controlling, namely, during\nthe first session of the fourth sitting on 14 October 1932, it is inter-\nesting to note that there was a considerable movement of the gal-\nvanometer coil after the medium's head had fallen forward on my\narm during cessation of trance.\nThe smallest movements of the coil need not be confused with\nmovements caused by room tremors, since the tracings caused by\ninterference due to the medium are unilateral and can be picked out\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 275\nfrom such tremors or irregularities imposed on the zero line of the\nrecords by fluctuations of the voltage on the mains. Violent body\nmovements by Rudi or by those near the infra-red ray apparatus\ncould not be made to affect the galvanometer. No such questions\narise, of course, with the large unilateral movements of the coil. But\neven if the smallest movements are rejected, the many records of\nlarge movements definitely indicate a considerable variation of the\ncurrent in the galvanometer circuit, which cannot be due to any dis-\nturbance other than the absorption of the infra-red radiation. In\nview of the distance of the medium from the apparatus and the fact\nthat he was always under vigilant control, it would appear that this\nabsorption is due to some agency, at present imknown, emanating\nfrom Rudi himself.\nA number of telekinetic phenomena described in other parts of\nthis report were exhibited during these sittings, and all I can assert\nabout them is that those which happened during the sittings I con-\ntrolled Rudi were certainly not due to him in the ordinary sense, as\nI was fully alive to the position of his body and to every movement\nhe made with his hands or feet throughout the sessions.\nIt might be mentioned as a somewhat noteworthy psychological\nphenomenon that diiring the first session of the eighth sitting on\n28 October 1932, while I was in control, the photo-electric cell\nflashed, and the light fell on the medium's face, when he instantly\ncoUapsed and fell forward on to me. This flash of light apparently\nweakened his trance state, for he did not completely recover his\nusual vigour for the rest of that session. His trance state and rapid\nbreathing, apart from anything else, are remarkable conditions,\nwhich cannot be said to be understood.\n5. By C. C. L. Gregory, M.A., D.I.C., F.R.A.S.,\nWilson Observer in the University of London.\nAt the request of Lord Charles Hope, by whose kindness I was\ninvited to attend the experiments with Rudi, I write this account of\nmy impressions.\nOwing to my usually being otherwise engaged on Tuesday even-\nings, I was present only at fourteen of the twenty-seven sittings.\nEarUer in the year (1932), also through the kindness of Lord Charles\nHope, I attended a number of sittings with Rudi under the direction\nof Mr Harry Price. With regard to these later sittings, I was im-\npressed by the scientific spirit in which the investigation was carried\nout, involving much time spent and hard work on the part of the\ninvestigators. To give one instance only, copies of each report of\nwhat occurred were sent on the day following each sitting to each of\nthe investigators. These reports were written during the sittings,\n\f276 Lord Charles Hope [part\nmostly by Captain C. Baillie, and I hope they will be published\nin full.\nThe following table is based on the reports, and is intended to give,\nat a glance, a rough idea of the distribution of the phenomena ob-\nserved. Columns I and II give the serial numbers of the sittings ;\nIV and V give the names of the controller (or controllers where a\nchange was made during a sitting) ; III gives the place and X the\nnumber of times \" cold air \" was reported. This phenomenon is to\nme, perhaps, the most interesting, because I have never experienced\nprecisely the same sensation when there has not been an alleged\nmedium present. The sensation is somewhat similar to that which\noccurs when the hand is placed near to a block of ice or to the open\nmouth of a iiask containing liquid air. The sensation appears to\narise at the surface of the skin, but this may be purely subjective.\nIt will be seen, however, from the table, that there is some correla-\ntion between the number of times \" cold air \" is reported and the\ntotal number of phenomena observed (given in columnXII). Column\nVI shows the number of times the galvanometer indicated (appar-\nently) a partial occultation of the infra-red rays.\nMr C. V. C. Herbert did most of the work in connection with the\ninfra-red observations, and his report should be consulted for this\npart of the work. Mr Herbert has worked with me for some years\nat the University of London Observatory, and I have the greatest\nconfidence both in his ability for scientific research and in his relia-\nbihty as an observer.\nColuran XI gives the number of times observers reported they were\ntouched by something. I had no such experience during the autumn\nof 1932 sittings, but I had one during those of the spring of 1932.\nIt felt much as if the palm of a hand were placed on the top of my\nhead for about 5 seconds, during which time I moved my head a\nlittle and had the impression of being in contact with an object\npossessing some inertia ; the red light, at the time, was suificient to\nenable me to see the people in my vicinity.\nThe total number of occasions on which objects were reported to\nhave been moved (shown in VII) amounts to 84. The actual dis-\nplacement of a number of objects during the sittings is imdoubted,\nbut the cause is entirely unexplained. I do not think the objects\ncould have been moved by any known mechanical or human means.\nObjects were moved while Rudi was being controlled by Fraser-\nHarris, Hope, Brown and Pollard, the average numbers on each\noccasion being 5-3, 3-0, 24 and 1-3 respectively, half-weight being\ngiven in the case of two different controllers at one sitting. It would\nbe interesting, on a future occasion, to try to obtain the movement of\nan object entirely coated with soot, in order to see if any material\ncontact was made with the surface of the object.\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 2,11\nThe next column (VIII) refers to sounds heard\u2014the ringing of the\nsmall bells attached to the curtains, sound of objects struck or moved,\nand the unexplained tapping or scratching noises.\nAlthough on only four occasions was anything unaccountable\nreported to have been seen, I have put these in a separate column\n(IX). Osty reports having seen, when Rudi was in \" trance,\" a sort\nof cloud near the ground, which moved from the bottom of the\ncurtains towards a table. Personally I have never seen anything\nunusual (except the movement of objects without apparent contact\nwith a propelling agent) with the possible exception of an unusual\nappearance on the ground-glass screen of the camera in 4. Sufficient\nred light passed through the infra-red filter to be visible in the camera,\nwhich was a \" reflex.\" I had been for some time observing the red\ndisc visible in this way when I noticed it was covered by a number of\ndarkish filaments in fairly rapid movement. This may have been\ndue to my retina becoming tired, though I have not observed a similar\neffect when viewing, for a long period, a luminous disc in a telescope.\nIt will be seen that the sittings (marked by a * ) at which I was\npresent, though only half the total number, included two-thirds of\nthe total phenomena recorded. This may possibly be explained as\nfollows : Rudi, while in \" trance,\" requires his audience to be\n\"lustig\"\u2014in other words, to keep up an incessant flow of light chatter.\nI think I contributed considerably in this direction, particularly\nduring no. 13, when I was third from Rudi in the circle.\nIt might be interesting on some future occasion to try some experi-\nments with some form of radiometer in order to see if this sensation\nof very local cold arises from an upsetting of the balance of infra-red\nradiation in the room. In fact it seems possible that the photo-cell,\nused in the infra-red experiments, might have been acting in this\nway\u2014one might get \" absorption \" of the infra-red rays without the\nspecial source of infra-red being used.\nI will now give an account of the \" incident \" which occurred\nduring the eighteenth sitting exactly as I wrote it two days after-\nwards, viz. on 27 November 1932. It was sent to Lord Charles Hope\nthe following day.\nReport of an incident at the sitting on 25 November 1933.\n\" Rudi-Olga,\" while controlled by Dr Fraser-Harris, was moving\nvarious objects, including the curtains of the cabinet. I then heard\na loud bump, which sounded as if the table in front of the cabinet\nhad been overturned. At the same instant the room was illuminated\nby the lamp which was the source of the infra-red beam. (It was\nafterwards discovered that the table had in fact been turned upside\ndown, and in so doing had jerked a thread which was attached to the\nsupport block of the infra-red projector, causing the filter to fall ofl'.)\n\fXIII Remarks.\n\"\nWhite\nlight\nhurts\nforce\nnot\nmedium.\"\nMedium\nin\nmuslin\ncage.\nMedium\nin\ncage.\nMedium\nin\ncage\n(roof\nofE).\nXII Total.\n<M O CO CO\n1\n\u2014\n1\nCO\nXI Obser-\nvers\ntouch- ed.

I at once rose from my seat, and\nfound Rudi quite limply on his side on the floor, and breathing very\ngently, slowly and regularly. After covering him with some dark\nmaterial which I was given, I assisted in lifting him back to his chair.\nDuring the whole of this period he made no movement of any kind,\nand appeared to be completely unconscious.\nIn conclusion, I should like to sum up my impressions as a whole,\nbut I find this to be impossible. It must be understood that I took\nno part in arranging definite experiments to test definite hypotheses,\nnor, indeed, did anyone else appear to do so, the exception being\nLord Rayleigh's experiments in the infra-red, which gave a nil\nresult.\nI think it may safely be stated that many of Osty's observa-\ntions have been repeated, in some cases under improved con-\nditions as regards the preclusion of trickery, and of this, I may\nsay, there was never the smallest sign, so far as I could observe, on\nthe part of anyone ; nor did Rudi's ordinary self seem at all com-\npatible with the suggestion of deception of any kind. On the other\nhand, the \" Olga \" personaHty seemed much Like that of a conceited\nchild playing a game of \" make-behef.\" It may well be that Rudi\nsuddenly becomes deeply unconscious (as he says he does) at the\ncommencement of his trance, and then, when he starts his very rapid\nbreathing, a type of cerebral activity begins of which we ourselves\nhave no experience. In this state, he may feel fully convinced he is\nanother person, \" Olga,\" and then, just as we in ordinary conscious-\nness have to rationalise, so he has to act a part. Apparently the\nmore his audience enter into his rather crude acting, the more self-\nassured he feels, and the better the phenomena, though how he\nactually does them remains a complete mystery.\n6. By Geeald Heard.\nI attended the sitting held on Tuesday, 18 October 1932, at 8 p.m.,\nat 65 Cadogan Gardens.\nDr William Brown controlled the medium. I spoke to him after\nthe sitting and also investigated before the sitting began the way in\nwhich he held the medium. Lord Charles Hope showed me the manner\nin which the cabinet in which the medium was placed was shut\noff both from the sitters and also from the area in which the infra-\nred ray was cast over the objects to be moved. I satisfied myself\nA\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings ivith Rudi Schneider 283\nthat this and the way Dr Brown held hun woidd prevent the medium\nmaking physical contact with the area. During the sitting, which\nlasted till midnight, I occupied at the various sessions a seat almost\nopposite the photo-electric cell. Before the sitting, Lord Charles\nHope had shown me the screen which, when lowered, prevented the\nsitters having access to the area covered by the infra-red ray. I\nsatisfied myself that this screen would prevent sitters from being able\nto interfere with the infra-red ray. As the records of the sittings will\nshow, some readings on the moving drum were recorded at this sitting.\nThe other sitting at which I was present was on 8 November. At\nthis sitting, during one of the sessions, I sat in the observation cell\nwhere the galvanometer is placed and saw some slight deviations\nrecorded on the drum through fluctuations in the galvanometer\nbeam.\n7. By S. Wheeler Eobinson, M.A., Ph.D.\nAt the suggestion of Sir William Bragg, I was invited to attend the\nsittings with the medium Rudi Schneider, organised by Lord Charles\nHope. With one exception, these sittings were held at 16 Queens-\nberry Place. Having read Dr Osty's report, I was especially inter-\nested in the infra-red absorption phenomena which are there de-\nscribed, and I spent most of my time during the sittings inside the\ngalvanometer room in company with Mr C. V. C. Herbert, watching\nthe indications of the recording galvanometer. I was unfortunate\nin that on all the occasions when I was present no infra-red absorp-\ntion was recorded ; but I was given every opportunity of examining\nand testing the apparatus. As a physicist I am xmable to suggest any\nnormal explanation of the absorptions which did, in fact, take place\nat other sittings, and of which records were shown me, if, as I have\nevery reason to believe, the apparatus was on these occasions\nequally well protected against mechanical vibration and outside\ninterference.\nI do not feel competent to give an opinion about the phenomena\nof telekiaesis which were described to me, since this is my first\nattempted experience of supranormal events ; nor about the remark-\nable physiological behaviour of the medium, which seems to be an\nobjective phenomenon well worth more detailed investigation.\n8. By William Brown, M.A., M.D.(Oxon.), D.Sc.(Lond.), F.R.C.P.,\nWilde Reader in Mental Philosophy in the University of Oxford.\nThrough the kindness of Lord Charles Hope I was able to take\npart in seven of the sittings held with Rudi Schneider between\nOctober and December 1932, acting as controller of the medium in\n\f284 Lord Charles Ho'pe [part\nthree of them. The conditions of the investigation were arranged\nwith great scientific care, although full consideration was shown for\nthe special wishes and instructions of the medium and of his so-\ncalled spirit Control Olga.\nThe trance into which Rudi passes is unusual, indeed imique, in\nnature and is characterised by very rapid breathing, which is inter-\nrupted at intervals and ceases to be apparent when \" Olga \" speaks.\nIt may be a genuine trance or it may be a simulation. I had no\nreliable scientific means of deciding between these alternative possi-\nbilities, although such very rapid breathing could probably not be\nduplicated by anyone in a normal state\u2014at least for any length of\ntime.\nI found that Rudi's systolic blood-pressure fell temporarily by\n10 mm. Hg. (from 140 to 130 mm.) between the moment just pre-\nceding trance and the moment of emerging from trance.\nSlight movements of the right cabinet curtain, i.e. the one near the\nmedium, and of objects a short distance away occurred at rare\nintervals during the sittings, and deflections of the galvanometer\nneedle were reported, indicating momentary partial absorption of\nthe invisible beam of the infra-red ray apparatus employed. But my\ngeneral impression was that the phenomena became less pronounced\nwhen conditions were made more stringent, as. e.g., by enclosing the\nmedium and the ray apparatus in muslin-walled compartments.\nAs far as my own experiences of the sittings went, the results were\ninconclusive, and neither proved nor disproved the possession by\nRudi Schneider of supernormal (or paranormal) powers of telekinesis.\nNevertheless the positive results actually obtained indicated the\ndesirability of still further research\u2014research which might produce\nresults of definite scientific importance.\nIII. By Lord Charles Hope.\nSince the sittings here reported on there has been published Mr\nHarry Price's An Account of some further Experiments with Rudi\nSchneider, being a report on twenty-seven sittings held in the\nNational Laboratory of Psychical Research from February to\nMay 1932. Readers of the present report will probably be glad to\nhave some comments on Mr Price's book.\nThe preface begins, \" The Coimcil of the National Laboratory of\nPsychical Research has pleasure in submitting to its Members . .\n.\"\nIt would appear, however, from a joint manifesto signed by most of\nthe active members of Mr Price's Coimcil, which was published in\nLight on 7 April 1933, and from a letter written the previous week by\nH. G. Bois, the acting President, that these members were ignorant\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 285\nof the charge of fraud to be made against Rudi, aud therefore\nthe responsibihty for the whole report must rest solely upon\nMr Price.\nIt must be clear to anyone reading the report that conflicting\nopinions are in evidence. On the one hand all the notes made during\nthe sittings, both those where Mr Price was present and those from\nwhich he was absent, tend, without exception, to confirm the genu-\nineness of the phenomena witnessed, such notes having all, I think,\nbeen dictated by Mr Price, whenever he was present, while the sitting\nwas in progress. On the other hand all the comments, deductions\nand conclusions by which Mr Price supplements the actual notes are\nwritten in such a way as to throw the maximum of doubt on all the\nphenomena witnessed during this series of sittings. Readers of the\nreport will ask themselves the reason for the divergence between the\nimpressiveness of the phenomena as recorded in the notes, and the\nsweeping charge of fraud brought forward by Mr Price against the\nmedium.\nIt is evidently Mr Price's own wish that attention should be con-\ncentrated on the particular section of the report in which Rudi is\naccused of fraud, if one may judge from the statements made by\nhim in the popular press just before the pubhcation of the report. I\nwill therefore go straight to that section.\nf At the sitting of 28 April 1932 Rudi was controlled by Mr Price,\nMrs De Gernon acting as second controller and, though this is not\nstated, as interpreter, Mr Price knowing little or no German.\nThe method of controlling Rudi during these sittings was the usual\none : the medium and the controller sit facing each other, the con-\ntroller holding the medium's hands with his own hands and clasping\nthe medium's knees between his own Imees. The second controller,\nwhose chief function is to connect the medium with the chain of\nsitters, and who, like all the other sitters, also faces in the direction\nopposed to that of the medium, holds the latter's right wrist in his\nown hand. The medium's right hand is thus held by both controllers,\nhis left one by the chief controller alone.\nFrequently, sometimes for many consecutive minutes, the medium\nputs up his left hand, which continues to be held by the controller,\nand strokes the arm or leg of one of the controllers to \" gather the\nforce.\" From time to time, usually when a phenomenon is expected,\n\" Olga \" (the medium's trance personality) asks the sitters to hold\ntight. This request, though addressed to the sitters rather than the\ncontroller, naturally makes all present \" hand-conscious,\" the con-\ntroller as well as the sitters. The same reaction, in the case of care-\nful sitters, follows the announcement or actual occurrence of a\nphenomenon.\nIn these conditions of control there took place during the sitting\n\f286 Lord Charles Hope [part\nof 28 April 1932, the following series of events, which I abridge from\np. 147 of Mr Price's report.\n\" 10.41. Rudi squeezing controllers' hand [apparently a misprint\nfor '\ncontroller's hands '] very hard. . . .\n10.44. [Various phenomena occurred.]\n10.46. Olga tells us to hold tight\u2014right curtain moving. . . .\n10.49. [Various phenomena occurred.]\n10.50. The flashhght has suddenly gone off\u2014but a second flash\nhas gone off immediately after\u2014evidently the second\nbulb hung fire. . . .\n10.59. Olga says that the power is getting stronger. . . .\n10.0. Olga tells us to hold tight.\n11.1. Again we are told to hold tight.\" ;\nThere were, to quote Mr Price (p. 145), \" three cameras in position.\n. . . All these cameras are exposed simultaneously if handkerchief\nis moved by normal or supernormal means \"\u2014-that is, the cameras\nstood with lenses uncovered ready to record whatever the flashlights\ndisclosed as soon as any movement of the handkerchief set off the\nflashlights. Mr Price reproduces certain photographs (Plates\nXVIII-XXI) stated by him to have been taken by the flashlight at\n10.59. From these it appears that Rudi's left hand, which ought to\nhave been held by Mr Price, was, during one of the two flashes, un-\ncontrolled and behind the medium.\nThese photographs were, to continue Mr Price's narrative (p. 152),\ndeveloped by him the following morning (29 April 1932) in Rudi's\npresence. \" When I removed them from the fixing bath I saw\nimmediately what had happened. When I confronted Rudi with the\nevidence, he did not know what to say. ... I formally charged him\nwith having freed his arm and suggested his having moved the hand-\nkerchief from the counterpoise himself. He made no reply. This\nconversation took place in the presence of Miss Beenham, the\nsecretary.\"\nRudi denies that any charge was made, and in the conflict of\nevidence between Mr Price and him, Rudi's denial is supported by\nsubseqiient letters from Mr Price to him, which I have seen, the tone\nof these being hardly reconcilable with Mr Price's statement.\nTo the comments Mr Price makes and the conclusions he draws\nfrom these photographs I will return later. I now continue the\nnarrative so as to gratify the reader's natural cmiosity as to whether\nMr Price's colleagues in this investigation formed the same opinion\nas he did from these photographs, when he communicated his\ndiscovery to them. The answer is that they formed no opinion.\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 287\nbecause 3Ir Price made no commimication about the photograplis\nto them, then or for many months later. Not even ]\\Irs De Gernon,\nthe sub-controller, was informed. Yet if the other sitters on 28\nApril had been shown these photographs soon after they were\ndeveloped, and questioned as to what exactly they had observed at\nor about the time of the two flashes, some material fact helping to\nelucidate the episode might have been brought to light.\nTwo further sittings of the same series were held. It was obviously\nimportant that the persons present at those sittings should be\nspecially warned to be on their guard in case a si milar incident\nrecurred ; but no hint of any suspicious occurrence at an earlier\nsitting was given them, nor was any attempt made to take further\nphotographs. Not even Captain Cochrane-Baillie, who had been\npresent on 28 April and was the controller at the sitting of 3 May,\nwas taken into Ish Price's confidence.\nNo hint was given to those who had financed the series of sittings\nthen closing of any suspicious incident ha\\'lng recently occurred, and\nlater in the summer, when ^Ir Price again sought fixiancial support\nfrom some of us for a proposed fm'ther series of sittings to be held\nin the autumn of 1932, he omitted to mention the photographs in\nquestion. Later those of us who subscribed towards the cost of the\npubhcation of his report were not informed that in it any accusation\nof fraud was to be made against Rudi.\nMost of the members of ]\\Ir Price's Council learnt for the first\ntime of the charges to be brought in the report from a sensational\nnewspaper article appearing ten months after the sitting.\nNot that ilr Price was silent as to the result of these sittings. In\nseveral newspaper articles written by h im between the close of these\nsittings and the publication of his report he wrote in eulogistic\nterms of Rudi and his phenomena. In the Empire News for 8 May\n1932 he says, \" For three years he has been under laboratory tests\nin England and France and has emerged unscathed from his very\nstrenuous ordeals,\" and again in Light of 20 May 1932 he writes,\n\" This is the third time he [Rudi] has been in England, and on each\noccasion he has added, to his laurels. For three years Rudi has\nbeen subjected to the most stringent laboratory tests in England and\nFrance and has passed every one with fl}Tng colours.\" Other state-\nments by ]Mr Price to the same effect, some written more recently,\nmight be quoted.\nIn the autumn of 1932 Rudi returned to London for the sittings\nreported in the earlier part of this paper, sittings held quite inde-\npendently of Mr Price. Early in 1933 I began putting together the\nrecords of those sittings, and towards the end of February Rudi went\nto Paris for a joint investigation by the Institut Metapsychique\nand the S.P.R. : in this also Mr Price had, of course, no part. Then\nE\n\f288 Lord Charles Hope [part\nand not till then did Mr Price spring his mine. The Sunday Dispatch\nof 5 March 1933 was his chosen vehicle for informing his colleagues\nand financial supporters of 1932, and simultaneously the uninformed\npublic, that ten months earlier he had caught Rudi faking\nphenomena.\nMr Price cannot complain if in the circumstances stated above this\nbelated \" exposure \" is received with reserve. The lapse of time\nprevents the recollections of the other sitters on 28 April 1932 being\nusefully invoked to confirm or refute Mr Price's version of what\nhappened at it. This would be of little importance if Mr Price's\ncase were of the kind which carried in itself instant conviction. It all\ndepends on the photographic control installed by Mr Price, and\nunfortimately this proved to be defective at the very same moment\nthat Mr Price's manual control was defective. The third camera,\ntoo, failed to record the incident. Mr Price informs us (p. 150) that the\n\" plate in the overhead stereoscopic camera was fogged by the light\nof the flash striking the lenses.\"\nThis is unfortunate, as it would perhaps have enabled us to judge\nmore accurately the position of the medium's free arm at the moment\nof the flash ; in the existing photographs this is by no means clear.\nInstead, therefore, of a clear and unambiguous photographic record,\nwe have, as Mr Price says (p. 150), \" two photographs, the one super-\nimposed on the other.\" This is certainly true, but he goes on to make\nan assertion miwarranted by the photographs themselves, or any\nother evidence. \" The first flash caught Rudi's left arm as it was\nheld straight out behind him : the second flash ignited when the\nmediimi had got into position again.\"\nIt is essential to Mr Price's case that he should establish that things\nhappened in that order. If it was the second flash which showed\nRudi's arm free, then the suggestion that he moved the handker-\nchief with his free hand and arm, and in so doing set off the first\nflash, falls to the ground. The photographic experts whom I have\nconsulted seem to be agreed that, where a plate has been subjected\nto double exposure, it is impossible to tell with certainty from the\nresulting negative which of the two images was taken first. When\nRudi is in a trance, he is, it seems, very sensitive to white fight and is\napt to give a sudden convulsive movement when any such light\nshines upon him. In this case such a movement nfi^ght easily have\nresulted in his tugging away his wrist from the controller's grasp.\nUnfortunately, on that occasion, Mr Price, who, to quote his own\nwords (p. 151), \" really was not in a fit state to control,\" was acting\nas controller and his recollections, in the circumstances, can be of no\nvalue.\nThe internal evidence of the photographs being ambiguous, we\nmust next consider what support Mr Price's view of the incident\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 289\nreceives from the notes of tlie sitting, the material parts of which I\nhave ahready quoted. It appears from these that at 10.41 Mr Price,\nas controller, was definitely holding the medium's hands, and that\nat 10.44, 10.46 and 10.49 he could hardly have helped knowing\nwhether or not he was holding the medium, since at those times there\nwere either phenomena or an injunction to hold tight. Neverthe-\nless we are told that one minute later, at 10.50, the medium had got\nhis hand out of Mr Price's control without Mr Price's knowledge, and\nhad faked at least one phenomenon. By 10.59, or 11.0 at the latest,\nMr Price must again have become \" hand-conscious.\"\nAltogether phenomena were reported as occurring on at least\ntwenty occasions that evening, and Mr Price suggests they may aU\nhave been faked as, he alleges, that occurring at 10.50 was faked.\nWhat was Mr Price doing with his right hand while all this was\nhappening ? It must be remembered that the usual method of\nevading hand-control was not possible here, for there was nobody on\nMr Price's right, and hence nobody whose hand could be mistaken\nfor Rudi's. Are we to believe that twenty times during that evening\nalone Rudi freed his left hand from Mr Price's right hand without\nMr Price knowing it, and that twenty times he succeeded in getting\nit back into Mr Price's hand, also without Mr Price's knowing it ?\nOr that Mr Price for minutes together, even hours, was holding\nnothing in his right hand and making no effort to find Rudi's left\nwrist ? I find either of these suppositions incredible in a man of\nanything like Mr Price's experience.\nAgain, are the distances such as to make Mr Price's accusation\nplausible ? The chair of the medium (A) and the position of the\ntable (B) on which was the handkerchief were as shown on this\nsketch\n:\nThe distance between the table and the nearest point of the\nmedium's chair is given on p. 192 of the report as 2 ft. 5| ins. The\nposition of the medium's chair was in no way fixed, but from a sub-\nsequent examination of the room I am convinced that usually the\ndistance was at least 2 ft. 10 ins.\nIn any case, however, two inches must be added for the distance\nthe handkerchief was from the edge of the table. Rudi's legs and\nknees were at the time of the movement of the handkerchief in their\nnormal position between the controller's legs : this is clear from the\nphotographs. Only the upper part of his body, therefore, was capable\nB\n[Not to scale]\nA\n\f290 Lord Charles Hope [part\nof any appreciable movement. Rudi is rather below the average\nheight. Could he, while his legs were immobilised, twist sufficiently\nround to enable his left hand to move an object at least 2 ft. 7^ ins.\nfrom the right side of his chair ? And all this is supposed to have\nbeen done without exciting the suspicions of either the principal or\nsecond controller !\nIt must be remembered, too, that some of the phenomena recorded\nas happening, both at the sitting of 28 April and at other sittings,\nmust have occurred considerably further from the medium's chair\nthan the handkerchief phenomenon could have been.\nThe suggestion made (p. 153) that at the sitting of 28 April the\nmedium was not \" in an abnormal state \" (meaning, presumedly, a\nstate of trance) need not be taken seriously, since Mr Price was\nevidently in an unusual state himself, being (p. 151) \" thoroughly ill\nthat evening and in agony with an abscess,\" and his powers of per-\nception must have been at a low ebb. Moreover nothing unusual as\nregards the medi\\un's state was recorded in the notes.\nWhen (p. 155) Mr Price implies that Rudi could have faked the\nresults obtained at the Institut Metapsychique in Paris, by freeing\nan arm, he can hardly expect to be taken seriously. The foolishness\nof such a suggestion will be obvious to anybody who reads Dr\nOsty's report Les Pouvoirs inconnus de VEsprit sur la Matiere, or\neven Mr Besterman's summary of it in Proceedings S.P.R., xl. 433 ff.\nTo mention only one objection out of many, Mr Price does not even\nallude to the clamped gauze screen, 5 ft. 6 ins. in height, which\nseparated the medium from the infra-red apparatus at many success-\nful sittings.\nMy own experience of Rudi's phenomena is entirely in favour of\ntheir genuineness, but I realise that anyone whose experience may\nbe of a contrary kind is entitled to say so, provided he states his case\nfairly and bases it on evidence that will bear scrutiny. Before,\nhowever, Mr Price brought his accusation, no serious or detailed\ncharge of fraud had been brought against Rudi personally. He has\nnever been one of these mediums who are only willing to sit for par-\nticular patrons of their own selection, and his readiness to accept\nany condition and submit to any experiment ought to make his\nsitters particularly careful as to the evidence on which they base a\ncharge of fraud and to the manner in which they present their case.\nI submit that neither the evidence Mr Price adduces nor his method\nof presentation is such as to make his charges count for anything\nagainst a medium with Rudi's record.\nWhat does emerge damaged from Mr Price's report is his own repu-\ntation as controller, conductor of investigations and critic. Mr\nPrice asks us to consider how much of Rudi's phenomena, produced\nin different series of sittings, can, after this \" exposure,\" still be\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with JRiidi Schneider 291\nconsidered genuine. I am quite prepared to face that problem, but\nwhat exercises me, and perhaps other readers of the report, still more,\nis what weight is now to be attached to any report, whether positive\nor negative in its conclusions, or any phenomena, produced under\nMr Price's direction or control or recorded by him ?\nAddendum by Theodore Besterman.\nAs I may not have any other opportunity of expressing my views\nin public, I desire here to say in the clearest terms that I cordially\nagree with the criticisms of Mr Price's \" exposure \" of Rudi Schneider\nmade above by Lord Charles Hope, in the Revue Metwpsychique\n(March-April 1933, pp. 110 ff.) by Dr Osty, and in Bulletin XX of the\nBoston S.P.E,. (pp. 86 ff). by Dr Prince. Quite apart from other\nand important considerations, Mr Price's report appears to me to\nbe in itself quite worthless as an exposure. It can have no effect\non Rudi Schneider's standing.\nIV. Synopsis of Sittings.\n4 October\u201416 December 1932.\nNotetaher.\u2014Unless otherwise stated, Captain the Hon. Victor\nCochrane-Baillie acted as notetaker at every sitting.\nApparatus :\n(1) Infra-red box with bell. (See C. V. C. Herbert's report, p. 264.)\n(2) Infra-red photographic apparatus designed by Lord Rayleigh.\n(See C. V. C. Herbert's report, p. 260.) All the tables on\nwhich this apparatus was placed were clamped to the floor.\n(3) Small photographic apparatus used at Queensberry Place.\n(See C. V. C. Herbert's report, p. 265.)\n(4) Projector transmitting beam on to a caesium-on-silver cell\nconnected to a galvanometer. (See C. V. C. Herbert's\nreport, p. 263.)\n(5) A drum camera used for obtaining records of deflections.\n(See C. V. C. Herbert's report, p. 262.)\n(6) Electrically heated flat-iron and Moll thermopile. Used on\none occasion only\u20146th sitting. (See C. V. C. Herbert's\nreport, p. 265.)\nAt some of the sittings a muslin-covered cage with movable back\nand sides was used. This cage completely enclosed the medium and\nfirst controller. (See plate 1).\nExcept at the 1st, 12th and 16th sittings there were strips of wood\nnailed to the floor to prevent the medium's chair from moving.\n\f292 Lord Charles Hope [part\nAt some of the sittings a muslin screen 6 feet high was interposed\nbetween the sitters and the apparatus and cabinet.\nBlack curtains were drawn across the cabinet at every sitting.\nLuminous strips were fastened to these curtains and six small bells\nwere pinned inside the right one.\nAt all sittings that infra-red photography was tried an artificial\nrose was placed near the lens to act as a pointer. Rudi-Olga was\nasked to place the power above it.\nA small table, not fastened to floor, was used at most of the sittings.\nOn this table the objects placed for telekinesis were usually a small\nhandkerchief, an artificial flower and a hand-bell.\nAt all sittings a toy balloon was placed inside the cabinet. It was\nplaced in a bowl of water to prevent it being blown about by the\nmovement of the curtains.\nAt almost every sitting water was sprinkled on the floor inside\nthe cabinet and outside in front of the curtains. Rudi-Olga had\nasked that this should be done at previous sittings on account of the\nheat and it was thought advisable to continue the practice.\nAt most of the sittings a toy harp and waste-paper basket were\nused, their positions on the floor being marked with chalk or\ndrawing-pins.\nThe small table used at all these sittings was 15\" square, 20\" high\nand weighed 6J lbs.\nThe waste-paper basket (actually a small close-meshed clothes\nbasket) was 14\" high and had a circumference of 34\".\nThe toy harp was 16\" long and 9\" high.\nTo realise the direction in which objects were moved the reader\nmust imagine he is facing the \" cabinet.\"\nMeasurements at 65 Cadogan Gardens for sittings with Rudi Schneider,\n1.

Mediimi out of trance.\nAfter the sitting : paper is found on floor 12\" from front right\ntable leg. Pencil f\" from it. Flower between two right table legs,\n5|\" from front one. Table moved 4\" towards medium from original\nposition at beginning of last period. No marks on writing paper.\nMarks on right side of smoked paper pointing diagonally towards\ncabinet.\nRemarks\n:\nThe medium was searched directly after the sitting by Lord Charles\nHope and Dr Fraser-Harris, with negative results.\nAs regards telekinesis, this was one of the best sittings in the series.\nIt should be noted that neither the infra-red apparatus nor the\nmuslin screen was used.\nBoth curtains moved freely and the bells on the right curtain\nrang. Cold air, and occasionally very cold air, was reported. The\ntable was audibly and visibly moved, then upset and finally moved\nwhen upset ; the harp was moved and played upon ; the movements\nof the curtains were so extensive that one sitter (Dr Fraser-Harris)\nfelt the right curtain touch his right hand.\nIn evidence of this free movement of the curtains, attention may\nbe drawn to the entry in the notes where it is stated that the bottoms\nof both curtains were wet, proving they had swung back into the\nbowl of water. The small quantity of water sprinkled on the floor\nat the beginning of the sitting was not sufiicient to have caused this\neffect.\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 313\nAt the close of the second part of tlie sittings, it will be noted that\n\" Olga \" was asked whether smoked paper for finger prints might\nbe placed on the table ; this was permitted. On the lights being\nturned up at the end of the sitting, it was found that instead of finger\nprints on the smoked paper there were areas where the soot had been\ncompletely removed and others in which it had been left in groups of\nparallel lines.\nAfter inspecting these markings, Mr Herbert came to the con-\nclusion that they had been made by the edge of the curtain swinging\nover the paper. Accordingly, after the sitting was over, he prepared\nanother piece of smoked paper and brushed its surface with the edge\nof the curtain. The streaks made in this way are identical with those\nmade during the sitting.\nThe correspondence between the streaks made during the sitting\nand those made on purpose afterwards is particularly close if one\nscrutinises them imder a hand-lens.\nLater the two pieces of smoked paper were shown to a finger-\nprint expert, who considered the marks all very similar.\nFourteenth Sitting. 3 Periods. 15 November 1932.\nAt 65 Cadogan Gardens, S.W. . .\nSitters.

Before this change there had already been good\nmovements of the right curtain and good \"effects\" in the ray.\nAfter Prof. Fraser-Harris and I had changed places there were some\nvery good and long deflections registered by the galvanometer just\nafter Rudi-Olga had said that she was about to bring the \" power\n\"\nout of the cabinet across the ray towards the sitters. In fact for\nabout half an hour during the second period Rudi-Olga seemed able\nto get good \" effects \" in the ray almost whenever she wished, the\npercentage of successes to total warnings from her being nearly\n100 for a few minutes.\n9.0.

The arrangements are as for sitting\nof 23 November except that two pieces of thick black cotton\nhave been fixed with drawing-pins, one across the whole front\nof the cabinet curtains and one between the inside edges of the\nwooden blocks on which stand the infra-red apparatus\u2014these\nare to prevent the curtains from swinging into the path of the\nray. As an experiment ice has been placed in the large bowl\ninside the cabinet and a smaller bowl behind the medium.\nThe position of the smaller bowl has been marked. Inside the\ncabinet behind the right edge of the right curtain two real\nroses have been placed. The muslin screens, when in place, are\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Rudi Schneider 317\nfixed with hooks on the inside. They reach from floor to ceiling.\nOn the extreme left there is a door of muslin, opening outwards.\nA piece of muslin 35\" high has been fixed in front of the sitters\nfrom the wall on left to the support to left of medium, thus\nleaving a space about 35\" wide behind medium and in front of\nboth controllers.\n8.30.

Olga says she is going to make a proposition. The reason\nfor this is a very important one. She says Lord Charles\nHope is to go to Dr Eraser-Harris's place and the doctor\nis to control. Capt. Baillie is to take notes. Frl. Mangl\nis to leave the circle and sit by Capt. Baillie as some man\nin the circle is thinking that she may be cheating.\nN.B. There was no foundation for this thought on the\npart of \" Eudi-Olga.\"\n11.7. Olga, \" Talk if you want to, but it is not necessary.\"\n11.11.

(An extra bit of ribbon with luminous paint had\nbeen pinned on to bottom left corner of right curtain, the\nT\n\f320 Lord Charles Hope [part\nbetter to show its movements. This omitted in beginning\nof to-day's notes by an oversight.) Says it will be all\nright if it is removed next time. If the power is not strong\nenough it hurts (otherwise all right). It disturbs the\npower as it comes out of the cabinet. Leave it now.\nSomething reported moving.\n12.38. Lord Charles Hope asks, is it the small bowl of ice.\nOlga says it is the harp.\n12.39. Lord Charles reports hearing a movement.\nOlga says power is on table.\n12.40. Scratching noise. This was repeated. Thought by circle\nto have been made on table ; but Olga says no, on the harp.\nOlga says power going into ray : Herbert whistles ^ (re-\npeatedly). Curtain reported moving (doubtful). Cold\nair reported.\n12.44. Whistling again by Herbert,\n12.46. Olga says she will put more power in. A few seconds later\nHerbert whistles to indicate increased power.\n12.47. Curtain (right) came right out as far as cotton would let it.\nThis indicated by extra bit of luminous ribbon. Bells\nringing on right curtain.\nOlga says, \" Hold tight.\"\n12.48. Accident. Medium has fallen over. Mitzi is upset\u2014crying\nout loudly and sobbing.\nMedium is reported to have fallen on floor.\n12.54. Eesumes fast trance breathing, though weakly.\n12.56. Breathing improved.\n12.58. Giving power back normally.\n1.3. Olga says, \" No damage has been done.\"\n1.4. She will come on Sunday. Olga says the curtain was be-\ntween light and the medium so he was not much hurt\n(Olga means to indicate position of curtain, which was\nflying outwards, had shielded the medium from the light.)\n1.6. Olga, \" Auf wiedersehen.\"\n1.8. Trance ended.\nAt 12.48 it appears that power threw table over. The table on\nfalling struck the cotton thread which was stretched between the\ntransmitter and receiver of infra-red rays. The disturbance of the\ntransmitter shook ofi^ the filter over it and so gave out white light,\nwhich affected the medium, who was thrown sideways on to the floor\n\u2014\n^ \" Whistling \" to denote effects observed in the ray. To encourage the\nmedium.\n\f131] Report of a Series of Sittings with Budi Schneider 321\nso reports the controller, Dr Fraser-Harris. Actually the cotton\nthread stretched between the blocks of wood supporting the infra-\nred apparatus was not severed but the other piece of thread had been\ndragged out of the wooden support for the muslin screen at back of\nmedium. (This may have been done by medium falling against the\nsupport.) The support behind him next to wall was found loose\nfrom the wall, a nail having been dragged out\u2014or possibly by the\ncurtain movements, which were violent. The blocks of wood supporting\ninfra-red apparatus had been placed on rubber sponges to prevent\nvibration and this facilitated the movement of the blocks, thus\ncausing the accident. The strip of muslin, as already reported, in\nfront of sitters, was removed after close of sitting and the position of\nobjects photographed, but it must be noted that before this was done\nthe position of the cm'tains (but not of the apparatus, table, etc.)\nhad been altered by Lord Charles Hope, who had pulled aside the\ncurtains. These, however, were put back into approximately their\noriginal position, which was normal, and then the photograph taken.\nNotes of last period taken by Mr C. Strutt and added to by Lord\nCharles Hope shortly after the sitting ended.\nTable was found completely reversed lying against the strip of\nmuslin dividing the sitters from the table, etc. About 21\" from and\n3\" left of its original position. Harp lying 6\" to 10\" from its original\nposition. Small bowl of ice half turned roimd. The last two effects\nmay have been caused by the movement of the right curtain. The\nhand-bell was on the floor to right, near table edge, and the flower\n(camellia) and handkerchief under the table.\nObjects placed inside the cabinet were found unmoved.\nNineteenth Sitting. 3 Periods. 27 November 1932.\n(Special.)\nAt 16 Queensberry Place, S.W.\nControllers. Lord Charles Hope and Miss Eeutiner.\n8 Sitters.\nThis sitting was arranged chiefly for the benefit of Mrs Osborne\nLeonard, the well-known medium. Frl. Mangl, the medium's fiancee,\nwas also present. No infra-red apparatus or muslin screen was em-\nployed. No phenomena were observed except feeble movements of\nthe right curtain. Three of the sitters reported that they were\ntouched during the sitting. But nothing more definite took place.\nTwo days previously there had been the incident of a white light\nshining accidentally during the sitting and this may have affected\nthe medium's powers.\nSitting started 5.21 and ended 8.38.\nt2\n\f322 Lord Charles Hope [part\nTwentieth SiTTiNGt. 3 Periods. 29 November 1932.\nAt 16 Queensberry Place, S.W.\nSitters.

Mes Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E.\nWhen I looked down the list\u2014the distinguished list of your Presi-\ndents\u2014and realised more acutely than before the eminence of those I\nwas invited to succeed, I confess I felt daunted. I have no claim\nand no right to be in this position. I have had no scientific training,\nI am neither a psychologist nor a metaphysician nor a philosopher,\nand when I cast about for a reason why your Council appointed me,\nI am at a loss. I have found an excuse for them though not a\nreason, but an excuse which I do not fancy they ever thought of.\nWith the possible exception of Professor Gilbert Murray I believe\nI ain the only one of your Presidents who has to admit that his or\nher interest in psychical research is mainly due, not to a scientific\ncuriosity, but to the desire to explain certain personal experiences,\nand to confirm or destroy the idea that he or she was possessed of\nmediumistic powers. I can well imagine that most people would\nfeel such a qualification was not a qualification at all, but a dis-\nability. A great detachment and calm acceptance of any fact,\nhowever disturbing to preconceived ideas, are not, they would say,\namong the probable characteristics of a mediumistic personahty.\nA President of this Society should be apart from any participation\nin the occurrences and tendencies which it exists to study.\nBut I am not sure if I agree with this view, even though I freely\nadmit that the kind of dissociation of consciousness which medium-\nship involves would not seem to be the best mental equipment\nfor dispassionate study. Yet there is also perhaps some advantage\n^ Delivered at a General Meeting of the Society, 27 September 1933.\nT7\n\f332 The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E. [part\nto be gained from an inner acquaintance with the pitfalls, the\ndifficulties and, let me say at once, the limitations of mediumship.\nIn my own case, just because my powers, such as they are, are\nvery restricted and faint, I have found any glib and simple explana-\ntion impossible to accept. When a medium has what is called a\nspecial Control who purports to transmit messages from discarnate\npersonalities, and the medium completely believes in the separate\nexistence of the Control, the explanation is considered obvious and\nsimple. But my mediumship was, or I may still say, is not of that\nkind. I have never felt as if I were being taken possession of by\nanother being, but I have often felt that someone or something\nquite imknown to me is speaking to my innermost consciousness,\nsometimes in words, but more commonly in pictures\u2014inner mind\npictures. This kind of inner voice and inner picturing has been a\npart of my being ever since I can remember anything, and it was\nonly when I was well over thirty that I realised the connection of\nthese experiences with any form of reality. Gradually, owing to\ncertain circumstances with which I will not bother you, I began to\nsuspect a consonance with the world I lived in, and a peculiar sense\nof communication and perhaps of guidance from some other place.\nSince then I have read and studied and experimented and have come,\nfor myself, to certain definite conclusions. It is of these I wish to\nspeak to-day, for they bear upon the work of this Society and might\npossibly stimulate further study on certain lines.\nProfessor Richet pubhshed in 1928 a book which he calls Notre\nSixieme Sens, and followed it in 1931 by a further volume called\nUAvenir et la Premonition. Professor Richet thinks we have a\nsixth sense, and that some of the riddles of existence might be\nsolved or be nearer solution if we explored it. His hypothesis is\nthat what he calls \" the vibrations of reality \" reach and are felt\nby the sixth sense of certain sensitive people, and are thus trans-\nmitted to their consciousness.\nHe really has two hypotheses, for his \" vibrations of reahty \" is\none and his sixth sense is another ; in his view they are inter-\ndependent. I will quote the final summing up of his conclusions\n(page 247 of Notre Sixieme Sens) :\n\" The world of reaUty sends out\nvibrations which surround us. Some are received by our senses,\nothers not perceptible to our senses are disclosed by apparatus ; but\nthere are still others not perceived by our senses or by our apparatus\nwhich act upon certain human intelligences and reveal to them\nfragments of reality.\"\nHe goes on to say that there are certainly more vibrations than\neither our physical senses or our apparatus or our sixth sense can\ndiscover, and that\u2014I quote again\n\u2014\" the world of atoms, electrons,\nstars, planets, animals, microbes, chemical reactions, heat, electri-\n\f132] Presidential Address 333\ncity are perhaps only a minute part of reality. Other forces of a\ntotally different order no doubt act upon us. Who knows if those\nother non-material worlds do not control our destinies ? We shall\nperhaps never know these forces ; our descendants will perhaps not\nknow them either. But that is no reason why we should deny their\nexistence.\" \"It seems to me,\" he says finally, \"that the sixth\nsense is a small, an extremely small, window opening on to these\nmysterious powers.\"\nEichet's hypothesis of the \" vibrations of reality \" I do not\npropose to discuss\u2014I am not competent to do so. But his demon-\nstration of what he calls the sixth sense rests mainly upon incidents\nand experiments with which we are all familiar and adds very little\nto our knowledge, though it is naturally of deep interest to us that a\nscientific man of Professor Richet's eminence should be so impressed\nby the results of psychical research that he has been forced, as it\nwere, to account for them by the hypothesis of a new sense. At the\nend of his book he hazards the suggestion that we may be witnessing\nthe beginning of a new stage in human evolution.\nI do not think the phrase \" sixth sense \" is a very happy one, at\nany rate in English, for the word sense is too much bound up with\nour physical senses ; but it has one advantage, namely that it\ngathers together all the many kinds of sensitiveness which we are\nalways investigating and recognises that they form one group of\nphenomena. I am interested mainly in those which are mental, and\nthat is why I prefer to limit myself to-day to what I will call super-\nconscious rather than supernormal faculty, because I mean the\nperception of something of which the conscious mind is ignorant\nand the term supernormal might include an extended but a conscious\nrange of one or other of the senses.\nBy superconscious power or faculty, then, I mean the acquisition\nof knowledge which is not in the content of the conscious mind, and\ncannot be obtained by any normal use of the senses, though any one\nof them may form part of the mechanism of expression. I am\nmyself of opinion that almost all psychic faculty, as shown by an\nextended use of the senses of sight and hearing, touch, taste or smell,\nare mere mechanisms for expressing the knowledge of the super-\nconscious mind. But I will return to this later. Under the\nclassification of abnormal mechanisms, telepathy of course_ takes\nthe largest place and is probably the dominating factor behind all\nkinds of mechanisms which convey superconscious knowledge. I\nneed not here describe the kind of knowledge which we can call\nsuperconscious, knowledge of events in the past or at a distance,\nknowledge of conditions of health, of emotion, all unknown to the\nconscious mind of the percipient. We are familiar with such\ninstances. But among these, incomparably the most important\n\f334 The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, O.B.E. [part\nas well as tlie rarest cases of superconscious knowledge have to do\nwith, the future, and come under the heads of precognition, pre-\nmonition, prophecy. I will return to this matter also later ; mean-\nwhile I would draw your attention to what I cannot help feeling is\na significant fact. It is this : I have been at some pains to examine\nthe different mechanisms through which superconscious knowledge\nis sometimes expressed\u2014trance, automatic speech and writing,\nmechanisms such as ouija boards, table-tilting, rappings, clair-\naudience and clairvoyance, cryptaesthesia, mind pictures and so on\n\u2014\nand I have found that the same kinds of verifiable superconscious\nknowledge have been obtained by all these methods. Further, a\nreal knowledge of the future is occasionally shown and events have\nbeen predicted which even the longest arm of coincidence cannot\nreach, and which by no stretch of telepathic access could have been\nforeseen. Here is the nodal point of the deeper mystery. The\nintercommunication between mind and mind is obscure enough by\nitself ; all work which tends to demonstrate telepathic power is\nintensely valuable and important, but it is especially so when it\nbears upon the baffling problem of precognition.\nSome people have felt that the telepathic explanation of every\nutterance of a medium, for instance, has been stretched to breaking\npoint, others that the implications of the existence of telepathy have\nnot yet been sufficiently worked out, and that there is no exhibition\nof knowledge of the past, present or future which cannot be ac-\ncounted for by an imcanny power to explore the recesses of other\nminds, even the unconscious hoardings, as well as knowledge, of\nother incarnate minds, however far they may be removed in space\nand however unrecognised the contact.\nI have always, for myself, felt inclined to stretch this nebulous\nexplanation to its uttermost limit, although I am continually\nsurprised that its advocates, once they have accepted the enormous\npowers of telepathy, should not have speculated more on the\nexplanation of this explanation. What exactly is the process of\ntelepathy and how is it used ? And still more, how does a medium\nin trance or out of it explore another mind and discover facts\nunknown to the owner of that mind, discriminate cleverly between\nwhat is relevant or may be relevant, combine the nuggets of fact\nwith other knowledge, fuse them by some alchemy, and present a\nconnected communication ? Is it any wonder spiritualists feel that\nthe intervention of another form of life which they call a spirit is\nthe only explanation ? But then there is the disturbing considera-\ntion that the spirits, if they be spirits, dramatise, lie, mislead.\nSpiritualists explain this by saying that it is the mind of the medium\nwhich intervenes and spoils the pure commimication. I think it\nwould be worth while to examine all recorded utterances of the\n\f132] Presidential Address 335\ndirect voice, or apparent direct control of the medium by a recog-\nnised personaUty, to see if these are freer than any other medmmistic\ncommunication from invention and falsification. If that proved\nto be the case it might support the spiritistic theories, and it there\nproved to be no such immunity it would also be an interesting tact.\nSome investigations now proceeding may throw light upon this\nmatter. .\nI am digressing however. I said just now that i thought it very\nsignificant that all forms of supernormal expression\u2014I except\nphysical materialisations, for I have not studied them at all\u2014 but\notherwise all the different mechanisms which I have examined can\nand do transmit information beyond the range of the conscious\nmind of the medium, and in some instances beyond the range ot the\nconscious part of any mind at all. Admittedly this is of rare\noccurrence, but it has happened and it is still happening. I cannot\ngive the evidence here and at this moment for such a statement-\nit would take too long\u2014but that information beyond the range\nnot only of the medium's conscious mind, but of any other conscious\nmind, comes through all abnormal mechanisms must be conceded.\nI submit it is significant that all forms of supernormal expression\noccasionally exhibit these powers. Of what is it significant ? And,\nespecially, what does the real knowledge of the future, shown now\nand then, imply ?\ni\n\u2022\ni\nAttempts are constantly made to explain say cryptaesthesia by\nsome hidden vibration, or some impalpable record left upon the\nobject ; or clairvoyance by traces left upon the ether ;\nor to account\nfor the knowledge of impending danger by observations uncon-\nsciously made. Of course the useful word telepathy is always\nhandy if the information could have been gleaned from any other\nconscious or superconscious part of a mind. But if every kind of\nsuperconscious knowledge can be conveyed to the conscious mmd,\nby every form of abnormal expression, does it not look as if the\nknowledge is not actually obtained by any physical means, but is\nonly conveyed to the conscious part of mind by their help ? The\nsupernormal forms of expression are very various and include the\napparent extended use of sight, sound, touch and so on. Is it\nlikely that in themselves these extended physical powers could\nreach such differing forms of knowledge? When driven into a\ncorner people say that every acquisition of superconscious knowledge\nis an example of telepathy and leave it at that.\nBut to say that superconscious knowledge has been acquired\ntelepathically is not to give an explanation, but merely throws the\nexplanation a little further back. In so far as it tends to establish\nthe idea of one faculty instead of several it may be an advantage.\nBut you do not solve one problem merely by presenting another.\n\f336 The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E. [part\nI contend that since superconscious knowledge of all kinds comes\nthrough all forms of abnormal mechanism, a unifying hypothesis\nis demanded. Further, that the content of the message obtained\nis of far more importance than the method of obtaining it and that\nevery such message should be judged on its content, exactly as if\nit were a normal utterance.\nBut to return, as I said I would, to the matter of precognition.\nKnowledge is often loosely called knowledge of the future when it\nmay be no more than the result of tapping knowledge possessed by\nanother mind. We understand very little of the process called\ntelepathy ; we only know that it exists, and that it seems beyond\nour conscious volition. A fictitious example of the wrongly called\nknowledge of the future might thus be the prediction that a certain\nperson would arrive in a few days when no knowledge of the intention\nof a visit existed. But the project might have been in the visitor's\nmind and so discovered. There are cases, however, displaying a\nknowledge of the future which could not be gleaned by telepathy\nfrom the conscious or superconscious part of any living mind, and\ncould not even be deduced from knowledge superconsciously\nacquired. In such a category are those strange flashes of knowledge\nas to which horse is going to win in a race, or as to the number\nabout to be drawn in a secret ballot or lottery, or the order in which\nfive or six cards will be dealt foretold some hours before a shuffle.\nThe case of Miss Nancy Sinclair in vol. xx of the Journal is worth\nstudy in this connection ; also those instances of prophetic state-\nment, foretelUng of events, important or trivial, disastrous or\nsuccessful, beyond the range of deduction. Such instances, well\nattested, exist ; there is no denying the fact. I think it is Professor\nRichet who says that even one undeniable occurrence of the kind\nis significant of a mystery we have not fathomed,\u2014and there are\nmany such. I am only dealing at this moment with the baffling\nexamples in which real knowledge of the future, the unpredictable,\nthe unforeseeable future, has been displayed. Admittedly these\nexamples are rare. They are, of course, owing to the requisite\ncondition of being unknown to any mind, mainly concerned with\naccidents or games of chance, though detailed statements of events to\ncome in the future have been made and justified. Most of us know\nof people who have been warned by some strange compulsion not to\ngo on a certain ship or travel by a certain train. And there are also\ncases of an extreme triviality, which show real knowledge of a future\nhappening, of so meaningless a nature that the word prediction\nwould seem to crush them, yet they too have been foreseen. I have\ncollected a few of these in a book called Our Swperconscious Mind,\nwhich develops at some length the point I am trying to make.\nIt seems that when we tackle the qixestion of foreknowledge and\n\f132] Presidential Address 337\nwhat it implies we are forced to entertain a different conception of\nTime. Past, present, future, is to us a ceaseless movement, the\nconstant passing of moments into our ken, past it, and out of our\ncontact. Instead of talking as we do of past, present and future we\nshould reverse the order and speak generally of future, present and\npast, since that is the procedure of Time as we know it. It comes to\nus serially ; from the future it passes us and disappears into the\npast. The habit of talking of it in the other sequence springs\nperhaps from man's anthropocentric point of view. Because he does\nnot normally know the future he assumes that it does not exist,\nexcept in relation to his own perception of it. The past he has\nexperienced, the present he is experiencing, but the future, in his\nopinion, does not yet exist. What if it does % What if it is already\non the film being unrolled before our eyes 1 It may be that we can\ncut and adapt or even remake the film, but still it may be there\nalready.\nI cannot pursue this enquiry ; it is too baffling. But possibly\nman's incurable anthropocentric attitude is, for all its crudity, on\nthe right line after all ; that instead of passing from the future\ninto our present and then into our past, Time is in reality our\nproperty, our stuff, and that we mould it, often unconsciously, into\nthe future. Instead of standing at the point where Time passes us\nwe are perhaps gathering up past and present and making the future\nourselves. Some few of us become aware of what it is we are\nmaking. However that may be, it seems we have to realise that\nfrom some other angle, or on some other plane of being. Time is\ndifferent from the passing, evanescent, vanishing time we know,\nand that occasionally we become aware of this.\nIt may be that there exists, even among human minds, a supreme\npower of deduction, in most people unconscious and unexercised, a\npower to see all the contributory influences, great and small, which\ngo to make the sum of the future. If such a power exists, it might\nimply also the faculty to create and shape those influences, a power\nof which man is very feebly conscious. I know all this is in the realm\nof fantasy.\nBut leaving aside the question of the future, so soon as we have\nto admit that the human mind is capable of these astonishing\nexpansions we have also to admit that many minds, and possibly\nall minds, have potentially the power to gather knowledge and\ncounsel from other minds ; that this is usually an unconscious\nprocess, and that we have not the faintest notion how it is done.\nPsychologists and psycho-analysts have taught us a great deal about\nourselves, especially perhaps the latter, because they have burrowed\nmore into the obscu.re regions of our whole mental constitution and\nrummaged among our dreams and fantasies and other disjecta\n\f338 The Hon. Mrs Alfred LyUeUon, G.B.E. [PAET\nmembra of thought, and have discovered the strange co-relation\nbetween the conscious and the unconscious parts of our being. But\nneither can they describe how this co-relation is or can be brought\nabout.\nThe unknown regions into which these mental excursions pene-\ntrate must have significance for us when we are trying to form\nsome rational idea of our constitution. If one mind can tap the\ncontent of an unconscious part of another mind and serve it up, as\nit were, to an outside consciousness,\u2014a relationship, a method of\ncommunication is implied, totally different in scope and practice\nfrom the usual one of speech and gesture, far more tenuous and\nmore subtle, and arguing some intercourse beyond that of our five\nmaterial senses. When joined to this indubitable experience we\nfind knowledge beyond the possibility of deduction by any mind,\nsuch as knowledge of the winner of a race, or of the result of a chance\ndraw in a lottery, or the order in which cards will be dealt, or the\nlong detailed knowledge of several incidents in the future, we are\nfaced with the problem at its most mysterious : a problem far\nexceeding in difficulty and import the comparatively simple one of\ndiscovering how unknown incidents in the past are reproduced by\nmediums.\nI have sketched a familiar problem and I move again into the\nrealm of pure speculation. Starting from the idea that we are\nignorant of our own constitution and are surprised sometimes by\nthe emergence of an animal and primitive passion, but still more by\nan unguessed power of divination or induction, I am inclined to\nbelieve that we live, not only within the narrow confines of our\nphysical body, but have a life outside it as well, a life of which we are,\nin the main, unconscious. Professor Richet is very contemptuous\nwhen writing of his hypothesis about \" vibrations of reality.\" He\nsays :\n\" Let us make this hypothesis and not admit the other, far\nmore fantastic, that the human soul travels about the universe\nwhere she meets no obstacles, to seek and to find the distant reality,\nand after this excursion reveals it to consciousness.\" \" Travels\n\"\nhere is an unnecessary spatial metaphor. Mind no more travels in\ngroping among impressions than a wireless operator when he tunes\nin different wave lengths. But in saying that a human being lives\nanother life than the one of which he is conscious it is not necessary\nto imply a separate entity. Once the expansion of the powers of the\nmind is admitted, as Richet unreservedly does, it is not ridiculous\nto conceive that part of the mind sometimes receives impressions\nfrom reality, or if you wish from vibrations of reality ; and indeed\nProfessor Richet's whole exposition rests on this possibility. The\nconfusion comes, I think, from the use of the words soul and sense,\ninstead of mind. At least the hypothesis of part of our mind being\n\f132] Presidential Address 339\nable to get into contact with influences from another region suffi-\nciently like that in which we live, for us to understand its language,\nstarts from something of whose existence we are aware. The\nfurther step of demonstrating that knowledge is gleaned from\nanother field of existence is only possible if something can be gathered\nwhich is utterly beyond the reach of any human mind, and yet can\nbe understood. There certainly are great forces, rhythms, ideas\nwhich are beyond the understanding of even the most developed\nmen of our race, but there is at least one kind of knowledge which,\nthough far beyond our grasp, we can yet understand, and that is\nthe detailed knowledge of a future happening which cannot be\nexplained by deduction or by telepathy. Somewhere, somehow,\nthere appear to be intelligences which know minute, trivial, un-\ninteresting events, as well as great and important ones, in the\nfuture. Spiritualists explain these foretellings by saying that\nspirits of the dead know them and impart them to us. This may be\ntrue, but I think it both more probable and more suggestive that\nwe ourselves (that developed portion of ourselves of which we have\nbeen speaking) come into contact with influences from another field\nof existence and gather information. It is to be noted that this idea\ntallies with what we are told by the illuminated, religious, artistic\nand psychical ; the mystical region reached after the dark night of\nthe soul is traversed ; the dreams of poetical and other genius : the\nvisions and intuitions of mediums. This idea has a relation also to\nthe theories of survival. If we can transcend our material senses\nwhile still inhabiting a body, can gather information and can impress\nother minds without the aid of the senses, it is not a very great step\nto imagine that we may continue to do this when the body has\ndecayed, that is, without the physical body as we now know it. Be\nall this as it may, I am convinced that our Society has been right to\ndevote itself strenuously to investigations into the expended powers\nof the mind.\nIn the matter of communication with the dead I incline to the\nidea that the superconscious part of a living mind may establish\ncontact with another plane of being, rather than that discarnate\nspirits visit the plane on which we live, though I should be far from\nsaying this never happens. But, as a general rule, I am of opinion\nthat it is a part of our own mind which reaches out and, as I said,\nmakes contact with discarnate minds. Some of the absurdities and\nincongruities of the purely spiritualistic theories are then dissolved.\nThe spirits of the dead need not be accused of fatuous complacence\nor foolish mimicry ; need not be blamed for a pre-occupation with\nuninteresting and trivial details ; it is that part of our own mind\nstill tied up with our conscious mind which plucks this and that\nfrom their minds and weaves them together, much as mediums are\n\f340 The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E. [part\nsupposed by critics to do through telepathy. We have ouly our-\nselves to blame for any exaggerations and falsifications. We know\nthat part of our minds can gather knowledge from other minds,\nsometimes unconsciously possessed, and precisely the same process\nmay perhaps be used to communicate with a discarnate mind.\nSo strong is the evidence for the existence of abnormal powers and\nsuperconscious knowledge that people like Professor Richet invent\n\" vibrations of reality \" and Professor Driesch talks of an entelechy,\nand, I think, it is Dr Broad who has taken refuge in postulating a\ntemporary association of fragments of mind\u2014called mindkins\n\u2014\nwhich for a period after death coalesce and preserve memory, and\nact as if they were coherent and identifiable. These entities would\nresemble the \" shells \" of Eastern and theosophical doctrine.\nThese learned men have been driven to find some explanation of\nstrange happenings ;\nthey cannot believe in immortality, or even\nsurvival, and imagine a mere temporary and shadowy existence, and\na kind of tentacle or filament which survives the jelly-fish of the\nbody for a time. These varying theories seem to me to be every\nwhit as empirical and unsubstantiated as any theory of the soul and\nits survival. Let us, however, provisionally give a lodging to the\nvibrations of reality, the action of entelechy, or of the mindkin.\nWe should make these little strangers welcome ;\nthey are sympto-\nmatic of the strength of the evidence which has to be accounted for,\nand are perhaps the signs of a desperate struggle, like that of a man\ntrying to close the door against a hurricane of wind.\nIt appears then that long patient work on precognition and\npremonition is called for. A good deal has already been done but\nthere is much more waiting the investigator. Lately, with the\nkind co-operation of Mr Dunne, author of that suggestive book\nAn Experiment with Time, an investigation of dream prognostication\nhas been made. The result of several hundred dreams recorded\nimmediately, and of course therefore before any possible fulfilment,\ndid not demonstrate that precognitive dreams are common. But\nthat is very different from saying that no precognitive dreams\noccur ; on the contrary it has long been known that they do, only\nnot with the frequency which perhaps Mr Dunne fancied. I joined per-\nsonally in the experiment, but was quite useless : this fact was of\ninterest only to me, because I happen to have had many precognitive\nexperiences through mind pictures and automatic writing. Dreams\nare apparently not the mechanism which suits my superconscious\nmind. As I have already said, the different mechanisms and\nautomatisms can all convey the same kinds of superconscious\nknowledge, and it is probably a question of fitting the instrument\nto the operator. Each golfer has his own special putter, without\nwhich he is lost when he has landed his ball on the green ; each\n\f132] Presidential Address 34]\nwriter his special peu and paper ; and so each superconscious part\nof mind, or whatever force it is that crystallises superconscious\nknowledge into conscious knowledge, has its favourite instrument.\nYou must lay the blame, if you are bored, on the Council who\nappointed me, but perhaps, in order to justify my speaking to you\nat all on these subjects, I might be allowed to give you my own\nexperience of the process of precognition, because, not being, as I\nexplained at the beginning, a psychologist or a metaphysician, my\nhypothesis has been founded on what I felt was the process. Of\ncourse I am well aware that this is a trick of the mind, but it may\nperhaps be of some interest if, having experienced these strange\nflashes of knowledge about the future, I try to describe the process\nof their acquisition. I have had experiences by two mechanisms,\nmind pictures and automatic writing.\nI have lately been looking at the studies made by Dr Yaensch\ninto what are called eidetic images among children, and like Monsieur\nJourdain's discovery that he had been talking prose, I have found,\nwithout any notion that such careful and extensive investigation\nhad been made into what I imagined was a rather rare faculty, that I\nmyself belonged to a common type of eidetic subject, the integrated\ntype. These grand words only mean that certain people and almost\nall children form images of thought, and that apart from after\nimages and memory images which are constantly objective, objective\nimages of ideas are often seen, especially by children. I have seen\nobjective images once or twice only, but eidetic images within the\nmind occur to me constantly. I know I have no right to use the\nterm eidetic images as Dr Yaensch is only examining those which are\nseen objectively. But my mind pictures are, I am convinced, of the\nsame nature as true eidetic images. I may be sitting idle thinking of\nnothing, when some vivid picture seeming utterly irrelevant will\nsuddenly flash upon my inner vision. As I have already said, for a\ngreat part of my life I was quite unaware that these mind pictures\nhad any relation whatever to events, or even to thoughts. But I\ndiscovered through one very startling consonance that they some-\ntimes had such a relation, and I began to watch them. What is\nmore, I found that I could induce them, and that if I could succeed\nin completely inhibiting conscious thought while directing the\npicture-making faculty on to a particular question, I could obtain\na relevant symbolic picture. Now there is nothing very mysterious\nabout this : it is only like a waking dream whose direction has been\ndecreed. But it is, I think, interesting that in this way I have often\nobtained information beyond the reach of my conscious mind, just\nas can an automatist or a trance medium. So far this information,\nwhen it had to do with the future, has not in my experience been\nwrong, though no doubt this method is subject to incursions from\n\f342 The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E. [part\nthe conscious part of mind, and therefore to error, like any other\nimpression. I am not speaking at the moment of the unpredictable\nfuture, such as a sudden accident, but the future which might be\nforetold by an intelligence which could avail itself of facts unknown\nto the conscious mind.\nAll this, so it seems to me, can come about without the inter-\nvention of any discarnate mind or spirit. But I do not see how it\ncan come about unless the mind of man has greater powers than\nthose of which it is normally conscious ;\nnormally I could not\npossibly know the outcome say of a certain anxiety ;\nsuper-\nconsciously I am apparently able to foretell it. I have had many\nexperiences of this kind, as have a great number of people. The\nmost interesting thing about them is perhaps that I can sometimes\ninduce them.\nThe knowledge of the real future which could not be deduced\nfrom any mind, conscious or superconscious, is probably rarely shown\nin eidetic images, partly because they are so often symbolic in\ncharacter, and I have not personally experienced more than the\npicture of a future event which might be gleaned from the super-\nconsciousness of some other mind and could therefore possibly be\naccounted for without involving the dreaded appearance of deter-\nminism.\nThen as to superconscious knowledge coming through automatic\nwriting the essential for me is to empty my mind of all thought\nwhatever, not an easy process for an automatist who remains\ncompletely conscious the whole time, and it was only attained after\nlong practice and under training, as it seemed to me, from an\nintelligence outside myself. I was taught to brush my mind as it\nwere, and given exercises or dodges to help the effort. Now, unless\nI am out of practice, I can empty my mind in a moment. Then it\nseems like an absolutely still pool of water. I wait, and into it\ndrop isolated words and sentences which often have no meaning at\nall for me. The impression is irresistible that I am Ustening to\nsomething which I can only hear, and still less understand, with\nextreme difficulty. If it had not been that I often found I had taken\npart in some cross-correspondence of which I knew absolutely\nnothing, I should never have persevered. In the midst of these\nsentences or communications have come precognitions. A paper on\none particular series, written by Mr Piddington, has been printed in\nProceedings. Whether or not any of them can be called precognition\nof a future not in the content of any living mind is not relevant at\nthis moment, for I am merely trying to give an account of the\nmechanism. The sense of an amalgam\u2014to use my simile\u2014between\nwhat was dropping into the pool of my mind softly like snow, and\nmy own conscious thoughts, was almost physical, and it may have\n\f132] Presidential Address 343\ngiven me tlie idea that part of my mind was talking to another part.\nI may say in passing that quite as strong as the sense of fusion\nbetween two parts of one's mind is the impression of moving out\ninto another region with part of one's mind. This is also no doubt\na fantasy, but the symbol of a definite experience. I could draw a\nmap of many of these regions, the vision or sensation being almost\nobjective. iBut that some of these communications were gleaned\nfrom intelligences outside my own consciousness I have no manner\nof doubt any more than that the intermediary was part of my own\nmind ; the only question left is, how much was picked up out of\nother Uving minds, and how much from minds which know things\nbeyond the reach of incarnated intelligences. I am, as is obvious\nfrom what I have already said, of opinion that the gathering of\nimpressions by the superconscious part of our minds has its counter-\npart in the transmitting of impressions by minds or parts of minds,\nwhich belong to another plane of being, and in most cases have once\nbeen incarnate here. Both processes may be either conscious or\nunconscious. Or it may be that the mind and bram are hke sifters\nand prevent the flood of perceptions from overwhelming con-\nsciousness. T n 14-\nBefore winding up I should like to summarise very briefly what\nI have been trying to state.\nWe know that many human beings have mental powers which\nextend beyond their senses and their consciousness.\nSometimes these powers seem to bring us tidings from another\nfleld of existence. . .\nSpirituahsts believe that such communications come from spirits.\nWe are all aware of the deceptions and confusions which obscure\nthis question. .\nI have been attempting to show that some of these disappear it\nthe hypothesis that in all communications spirits take possession\nof a living organism and express through it is replaced by the\nhypothesis that we ourselves can not only ransack other living\nminds, as is admitted by all who believe in telepathy, but can\nsometimes penetrate another field of existence and gather informa-\ntion. This hypothesis conforms to the beliefs of religion and the\nintuitions of genius.\nNo evidence of the identity of the dead will carry _\nmteflectual\nconviction of survival because of the immense ramifications of\ntelepathic power which are now recognised or conjectured. I stress\nthe word intellectual because I am purposely leaving aside the\nconviction borne in upon an individual that he or she has been m\ncontact with a personality whose idiosyncrasies and methods are\nwell known and are reproduced in the communication. It is not of\nany special interest what I myself think about this, but in order to be\n\f344 The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E. [part 132]\nperfectly honest and to remove any possible misconception I should\nhke to say that I believe communication with the dead is possible\nand that it occurs constantly though not often consciously. The\nhypothesis I have been making that part of our mind can come into\ncontact with another region should support the idea that we are not\nbounded by our physical bodies, and can survive them, and that\nperhaps the regions of which we become aware are those where we\nmeet the surviving personalities of the dead. But the personality\noi a being who is dead can only be demonstrated and carry convic-\ntion to one who has known the personality in life. For the general,\na reasoned logical conviction is needed. This could be produced if\nevidence is\n_\naccumulated of a region which is sufficiently like the\none we live in for us to recognise, and is yet so different that we have\nto realise the probability of another field of existence. Time is\nserial in our life ; it does not seem to be so in other forms of life.\nThe future can be recognised in the present ; our superconscious\npowers bring us tidings of this in our real premonitions and fragments\nof true knowledge.\nThe idea that part of our own minds can reach out to other regions\nin no way controverts the possibility of inhabitants of another realm\nof life\u2014spirits\u2014etherics\u2014discarnates\u2014call them what you will-\ninfluencing human minds.\nInteraction is a word which denotes what seems possible ; inter-\naction directed from beings in this life as well as from beings in\nanother life.\nI commend to the Society further studies in the unknown region\nalready entered by such men as Richet, Maeterlinck, Osty, Dunne.\nIt seems to me that it might be possible to direct certain experi-\nments with cards, not using numbers of people and not with a view\nto detecting clairvoyance, like Miss Jephson's extremely interesting\nexperiments, but merely precognition. I have not thought out any\nprocedure and am merely hazarding suggestions. Also people\nmight be asked to note any impression of a future happening which\ncame to them in whatever form\u2014record the impression and have\nit witnessed, and on fulfilment send in a statement. It would be\ninteresting also to know how many real impressions were not\nfulfilled\u2014say after a year or two. One wishes to inculcate the habit\namong people subject to such impressions of recording and witness-\ning. The research into this obscure question will be long and\narduous, but that should not and will not deter the Society for\nPsychical Research.\n\fAN EXPERIMENT IN \" CLAIRVOYANCE \" WITH\nM. STEEAN OSSOWIECKI.\nBy Theodore Besterman.\nDuring the course of a visit to Warsaw ia the spring of 1933, in\ncompany with Dr Osty, I made the acquaintance of M_. Ossowiecki,\nwell known as an amateur clairvoyant who has obtamed striking\nsuccesses.! it was not at the time possible for me to arrange an\nexperiment with M. Ossowiecki, as he was busy with one prepared\nby Dr Osty. M. Ossowiecki kindly promised, however, that he would\nattempt to \" read \" the contents of a sealed envelope if I cared to\nsend him one on my return to England. Immediately on my return\nto London I accordingly, on 17 May, sent M. Ossowiecki a sealed\nenvelope. Receiving no reply I caused inqmries to be made and\nfinally in July, I heard from M. Ossowiecki that the envelope I had\nsent him had been regarded as suspicious by the censorship and\nhad been opened by them. M. Ossowiecki suggested that I should\nprepare another envelope and send it to M. Gravier, the President\nof the Polskie Towarzystwo Badan Psychicznych, before which he\nwould then carry out the experiment. This I did, despatching the\nsecond sealed envelope on 11 July to Madame Wodzmska, for passing\non to M Gravier, as I did not know the latter's address. There the\nmatter rested so far as I knew until the end of September, when,\nknowing that Lord Charles Hope was going to Warsaw, with Miss\nA Reutiner and I^Ir John Evelyn, both Members of the Society 1\nasked him to make an effort to get the experiment carried out. This\nhe accordingly did, with the kind help of M. Gravier. Actually,\nhowever, as I afterwards learned, there had already been two pre-\nliminary and fairly successful sittings.\nBut before deahng with these preliminary sittings, I will describe\nthe sealed packet, which, with its contents, was prepared at, and\ndespatched from, my desk in the Society's rooms. Figure 1 is a\nphotograph of the paper I had prepared. ^Vhen folded it measured\n93 mm. by a trifle over 107 mm. It was placed m a reddish orange\n\" Ensign \" light-tight envelope (that is, not transparent to white\nlight) measuring 94 mm. by 119 mm. This envelope was m turn\nenclosed in a black \"Ensign\" light-tight envelope, measuring\n106 mm. by 130 mm. This black envelope was finally enclosed m\n1\nSee, for instance, the report of the Warsaw Congress of 1923 pp. 201 ff\n.\n;\nDr G. Geley, UEctophsynie ei la CUirvoyance (1924), pp. 29 ff. ;\nStefan Osso-\nwiecki, Awiat rnego Ducha (1933).\n346\n\f346 M. Stefan Ossowiecki [part\na large Manilla envelope doubled in two and thus measuring 114 mm.\nby 152 mm. Each of these envelopes was closed in a special way\nand bore private and invisible marks. The outer doubled envelope\nwas m addition sealed with surgical tape arranged in a special way\nand signed by me. This packet was then further enclosed in a stout\nouter envelope and sent to Mme Wodzinska, who remitted it direct\nto M. Gravier. A statement from her to that effect follows in\nAppendix Ai. M. Gravier retained the packet in his possession\nuntil the beginning of the sitting described below. A statement\nfrom M. Gravier follows in Appendix A ii.\nI will now give an account of the two preliminary sittings, in the\nform of a statement by M. Gravier, who writes :\nAfter receiving your sealed envelope the contents of which were\nto be detected by M. Ossowiecki, he and I had two sittings on 8 and\n9 August 1933.\nDuring these meetings the following was said.\nOn 8 August M. 0. : Sees Mr Besterman,\u2014he sees that it is\nbetween 6 and 8 o'clock in the evening and that Mr Besterman cuts\na picture from an illustrated English paper. Picture of the size of\n6x7 centimetres. He sees four envelopes one in the other.\nThis meeting took place in my home.\nThe following day, 9 August, meeting at M. O.'s, who says :\nIt is not an illustration cut from a paper.\nIt is a drawing made on a big piece of paper, this drawing is\n5x6 centimetres.\nThere are three envelopes\u2014one exterior, the next black, the third\ncoloured,\u2014it is neither yellow, nor blue, nor red, I think that it is\nrose, but I do not see very well.\nBesides the drawing there is something written :\nIt represents something like a goblet, closed with a cork, and there\nIS something written, not on the goblet, but around it\u2014I see a W\u2014\nI see a capital I,\u2014I also see an S and something red and something\nblue. That makes me confuse it with the letters.\nSince then M. 0. was unwilUng to give any further sitting, saying\nthat he had thought it over and could not agree to continue if the\nenvelope was not afterwards opened before him.\nWhen Mile Reutiner, Lord Charles Hope and Mr Evelyn came we\ndecided that they would take the responsibility of opening the\nenvelope on your behalf and that it should be opened immediately\nafter [the sitting].\nYou know the rest.\n\u2014\n[Literal translation.]\n[Signed] A. Gravieb.\n\f\f\f132] An Experiment in \" Clairvoyance\n\" 347\nOn 29 September 1933 M. Ossowiecki invited a number of friends\nto his flat for tlie purpose of witnessing bis attempt to read \" the\ncontents of tbe envelope. Lord Charles Hope writes :\n\" Soon after\nM.

The above account was signed by M. A. Gravier,\nMiss Alice Reutiner, Lord Charles M. Hope, Mr John Evelyn, Prince\nJ. Woroniecki, and seven others.\nOn 3 October 1933 Lord Charles Hope handed to me, in London,\nthe original of the above account, M. Ossowiecki's drawings, and\nthe opened envelopes. I minutely examined the envelopes and\nfound that, with the exception of considerable wear and tear on the\nouter envelope, they were all intact. The private marks which I\nhad made and which would have been inevitably disturbed on any\nattempt to open the envelopes, were all in order. ^ I have no hesita-\ntion in saying that none of the three envelopes was opened. I am\nalso satisfied that no effort was made, an effort which would not in\nany case have been successful (because, among other reasons, of the\nspecial folding of the paper), to render the contents transparent by\nchemical means. The same is true of X-ray and similar methods.\nIt will thus be seen that M. Ossowiecki's clairvoyant reading (as it\nmay for convenience be called, thoiigh other supernormal theories\nare not excluded) was almost completely successful. It would of\ncourse have been more satisfactory if the envelope \" read \" had been\nthe one I had with me in Warsaw, or, failing that, the first packet\nI sent. Still, the main point is clearly that the packet should not\nhave been tampered with ; and of that I am satisfied. Cordial\nthanks are due not only to M. Ossowiecki himself for his brilliant\nperformance, but also to M. Gravier and to Mme Wodzinska for\ntheir invaluable help.\nA point of theoretical interest is this : the subject of the test\nwas deliberately of such a kind {e.g. \" Swan \") as to be capable of\nbeing symbolically \" perceived \" ; also the drawing was so dis-\nposed that the folding of the paper completely destroyed the form\nof the bottle and of one word, leaving the other word intact. None\nof these things affected M. Ossowiecki's \" reading,\" which is almost\nan enlarged facsimile, except that in his second drawing there are\nlines that might be taken to indicate the folding.\n1 For obvious reasons I do not describe these private marks ;\nthey are known\nto Mr and Mrs Salter and to Lord Charles Hope.\n\f132] An Experim,ent in \" Clairvoyance\n\"\n351\nAPPENDIX A.\nStatements.\nIn accordance with, your wish I certify having received your sealed\nenvelope and having remitted it intact to M.
