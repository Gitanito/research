HENRY SIDGWICK.\nPsychical Research has, both since the Society was founded\nand for several years before that, occupied so large a place in\nmy life and thoughts\u2014the investigations the Society was\nfounded to promote have seemed to me so important, and\nlikely to be so far reaching in their effects, that the honour\nof being invited to fill the President\u2019s chair has naturally\nbeen very gratifying to me. At the same time when I look\nat the list of my predecessors, and note how many of them\nhave been eminent in Philosophy, Psychology or Physical\nScience, I feel it is difficult to succeed them with credit ;\nand I have decided that my best chance of interesting you\nwill be not to attempt in this address to make any original\ncontribution to the philosophy or science of the subjects with\nA\n\f2 Mrs. Henry Sidgtvicl:. [part\nwhich our Society is concerned, but rather to review our\nposition\u2014taking stock as it were of the progress made during\nthe 26 years of the Society\u2019s life, and considering what are\nthe most hopeful lines of advance at present. Such a general\nsurvey has naturally at various times formed a subject of\npresidential addresses, but not I think very recently.\nI will refer first to worldly prosperity. Of the improve-\nment of our position in this respect we have three indications.\nThe first is increased membership, whicli is very important\nfrom the pecuniary point of view, but yet more as implying\nincreased effective interest in our work. We may congratulate\nourselves too on the number of persons eminent in other\nbranches of scientific research whom we continue to add to our\nranks.\nA second indication of the cfreater estimation in which we\nO\nare held may, I think, be found in the tone of presidential\naddresses. I notice tliat in the early years of the Society\nthese were largely occupied with apologies for its existence,\nand defence of its aims and methods against attacks from\nunscientifically incredidous scientists on the one hand and\nunscientifically credulous spiritualists on the othei\\ Since\nabout 1889 this attitude has changed\u2014not that attacks from\nboth these points of view do not continue, but they affect us\nless. We stand more firmly on our own feet and our aims\nand methods are better understood and consequently more\nwidely sympathised with.\nA third indication of material prosperity is the growth of\nour endowment fund\u2014a very necessary part of our equipment,\nand likely to become more and more necessary as the work\ngrows. Bequests from late members and gifts from present\nmembers have already raised the fund to an important sum,\nthough not yet sufficient for present and prospective needs.\nAnd I may remark that some contributions to this fund\n\u2014\nsuch as the one lately announced in the Journal from Lord\nEayleigh, President of the Eoyal Society and from the beginning\none of our Vice-Presidents \u2014are valuable not only as adding\nto the fund but for the moral support they bring.\nTills is an appropriate place to announce that lately we\nhave learnt that the Society will receive an important addition\nto its funds\u2014amounting probably to some \u00a33000 or \u00a34000,\n\fPresidential Add.ress. 3\nLvn.]\nthrough the bequest of Mr. H. A. Kay, a member who died a\nfew months ago.\nWorldly prosperity, though it furthers our work and is even\nindispensable to its full development, is no measure of the\nwork itself, and we must now turn to review the progress made\nin this work, and to consider the prospects before us and the\ndifficulties that beset our path. And lest in what follows I\nshould seem to dwell more on difficulties than on success, and\nshould appear to some unduly cautious, let me say at the outset\nthat no one can feel more strongly than I do the value and\nimportance of the work we are engaged on or be more confident\nthat it is worth all the time and energy we can spend on it.\nKor can any one more sincerely congratulate our Society on the\nwork it has already done and is doing, or look forward more\nhopefully to the progress that lies before us.\nIn the paper describing the objects of the Society which is\nsent to enquirers, the principal departments of work are\ndescribed under five heads, which may be briefly stated as\nfollows :\n\u2014(1) Telepathy ; (2) Hypnotism and Clairvoyance ;\n(3) Spontaneous veridical apparitions ; (4) The physical pheno-\nmena of spiritualism; (5) The historical investigation of the\nsame subjects. This catalogue is, of course, not exhaustive. It\nis difficult, for instance, to say under which head we should\nplace Professor Barrett\u2019s full and interesting investigation,\nexperimental and historical, into dowsing\u2014the finding of water\nand other things by the so-called divining rod\u2014published in\nVolumes XIII. and XV. of our Proceedings. Possibly, as he\nsuggests provisionally,^ the proper place may be under the head\nof Clairvoyance\u2014so far, of course, as the success of the dowser\ncannot be attributed to external indications. If it is due to\nclairvoyance it affords almost the only evidence we have of\npure clairvoyance or telaesthesia \u2014the perception by means\nother than the senses of physical facts unknown to any living\nhuman being and therefore not explicable by any extension of\nthe faculty of telepathy between living minds. This distinction\nbetween clairvoyance which may possibly be telepathic and\nthat which cannot is I think of great theoretic importance.\nThere were in old days alleged cases of pure clairvoyance\n\u2014\ne.g. of the reading of mottoes enclosed in nuts ;\nbut we have\n^ Proceedings, Vol. XV. p. 314.\n\f\u2022i Mrs. Henry Sidgtviek. [part\nin this Society come across exceedingly little clear evidence\nof it,^ unless it is exemplified in dowsing. The best recent\ncase I know which seems 'pririia facie to suggest clairvoyance\nis one contributed by Professor William James to the\nProceedings of the American Society (Part II.) and briefly\nnoticed in our Journal last October. In this case the position\nof a dead body for which search had been vainly made was\ncorrectly described, and afterwards identified, by a spontaneously\nentranced person, though neither she nor (so far as can be\ndiscovered) any other living person can have known about it\nnormally.\nThe paucity of evidence for pure clairvoyance gives special\ninterest to the question whether successful dowsing ever in-\nvolves it, or whether on the contrary it is to be explained by\nsome obscure and hitherto undiscovered physical faculty. In\nwhatever way this question is answered, however, there is no\ndoubt that dowsing is a form of motor automatism. In what-\never way the presence of, say, underground water reveals itself\nto the unconscious strata of the mind, the knowledge is\nexpressed through the involuntary muscular movement which\ntwists the forked twig used as a divining rod. The great extent\nto which automatism, as an external expression of subliminal\nmentation, pervades all the departments of our work is one\nof the things that we have learnt in the last 26 years.\nThis fact and its importance will be present to the minds\nof all who have read Mr. j\\Iyers\u2019s great work on Human\nPersonality.\nHypnotism, chiefly because it enables the experimenter to\ncommunicate with the subconscious strata of the mind in a\ndefinite way, is one of the most effective means we have of\nexperimentally investigating automatism and the relation of\ntlie subconscious to the conscious mind. This alone makes its\nstudy of the utmost importance to us, quite apart from any\nsupernormal faculties that hypnotised persons occasionally ex-\nhibit. The progress that hypnotism has made since 1882 is\namusingly marked by the fact that when the Society was\nfounded enquiry into the reality of hypnotic anaesthesia\u2014\na\n' I have not forgotten Professor Ricbet\u2019s experiments in \u201clucidity\u201d published\nin Proceedings, Vol. V. pp. 77-116 (1888), but they can hardly, I think, be\nregarded as altogether beyond explanation by chance.\n\fLVii.] Presidential Address. 5\nthing which no well instructed person now doubts \u2014was set\ndown among objects of investigation. We cannot of course\nclaim that it is our Society which has brought about the now\ngeneral recognition of the existence of hypnotism, nor more\nthan a part of the great advance made in our knowledge of it.\nWe have no doubt contributed to this advance, but the credit\nis chiefly due to members of the medical profession who have\nused hypnotism in their practice. Their investigations are\nclosely related to ours for the reason that suggestive therapeutics\nand psychical research both have much to do with the sub-\nconscious mind ;\nand we are fortunate in having many of the\nleading exponents of hypnotism both in England and abroad\nactively interested in the work of the Society.\nIt is, I think, inevitable that the study of hypnotism should\nbe mainly in the hands of medical men, and it is probably also\ndesirable ;\nbut it would be disastrous if this were to confine\ninvestigation to the therapeutic aspect of the subject. The\npurely psychological knowledge that may be gained through\nhypnotism is obviously of the greatest scientific importance\n;\nand especially is it so to psychical researchers, through the\nlight thrown on subconscious mentation, on dissociation of\npersonality, and on hidden powers of the human mind. In\nthe psychology of the subject our Society can boast of valuable\nwork, as evidence of which I may refer to Mr. Gurney\u2019s\nimportant papers in early volumes of the Proceedings, and to\nDr. Milne Bramwell\u2019s, and (quite recently) Dr. Mitchell\u2019s ex-\nperiments on the Appreciation of Time by Somnambules.^ Nor\nhave we been without confirmation of the manifestation of\nsupernormal faculties in the hypnotic state, as, for instance, in\nthe case of Dr. Alfred Backman\u2019s subjects in Sweden or Dr.\nWiltse\u2019s in the United States of America.^\nIn connection with hypnotism I may remark that it is to the\nstudy of this subject, and the light it has thrown on the power\nof suggestion, that we largely owe our present knowledge of the\nquite special difficulties that attend experiments in psychical\nsubjects. In experimental work progress is made by taking\nsome provisional hypothesis and testing it\u2014or, to put it other-\nwise, by asking nature questions to which phenomena obtained\n^Proceedings, Vol. XII. p. 179; Vol. XXI. p. 2.\n- Proceedings, Vol. VII.\n\f6 Mrs. Henry Sidgiuick. [part\nunder suitably arranged conditions give the answers. That,\nindeed, is what we mean by experiment. The special difficulties\ninherent in psychical experiments arise from the fact that dealing\nas we do with the human mind under circumstances where\nsuggestion is powerful, both the question itself which we address\nto nature and the expectations as to the answer become to an\nunknown extent part of the conditions to be dealt with and are\nliable to be disturbing factors very difficult to eliminate. For\ninstance, it is, I think, now generally admitted that the theories\nas to hypnotic processes put forward by Dr. Charcot and the\nSalpetriere school were largely vitiated by insufficient attention\nto the effect of preconceived ideas as to what was expected to\nhappen, with which the observers themselves inspired the\npatients. Suggestion in its widest sense too is as likely to\noperate in inhibiting phenomena as in affecting their form, and\nit seems not unlikely that the difference in the kind of psychical\nphenomena observed with hypnotic patients by e.g. Dr. Elliotson\nin the fifties and Dr. Eramwell now, may be partly due to the\nmental attitude of the experimenters acting on the patients.\nEspecially may this be so if telepathy be a vera causa, since in\nthat case the utmost effort to conceal thoughts and feelings\nmight fail to prevent unintended mcoital suggestion. To the\ndifficulties arising from suggestibility we have to add those due\nto the operation of subliminal inferences and memories which\nare often hard to detect. The extreme care and caution in\ndrawing conclusions which all this necessitates may well make\nprogress slow ;\nbut every branch of scientific investigation has\nits special difficulties, and ours sliould not discourage us, but on\nthe contrary stimulate us to greater efibrt.\nFollowing the order of the list of departments of the Society\u2019s\nwork already referred to we come after hypnotism to the collec-\ntion and investigation of spontaneous veridical apparitions and\nanalogous phenomena. It would, I think, be generally admitted,\neven by those not yet convinced of telepathy, that the work done\nunder the auspices of the Society has thrown a new light on\nthe subject of apparitions. And most of us here present have\nprobably been convinced of the telepathic origin of many of\nthem by the evidence ably set forth by Mr. Gurney, Mr. Myers,\nand Mr. Podmore in the book Phcmtasms of the Living in 1886.\nThis evidence has been supported by further cases constantly\n\fLVII.] Presidential Address. 7\nreceived since then, and has been, supplemented in an important\nway by the so-called \u201c Census of Hallucinations \u201d\n\u2014the statistical\ninvestigation and classification of the spontaneous hallucinations\nof persons in ordinary health\u2014published in Volume X. of the\nProceedings. But there remains much to be done both in\ncollecting more well-evidenced cases and in getting the import-\nance of recording experiences immediately to be more generally\nunderstood. More cases are wanted not only in order to\nconvince the scientific world, but in order that a comparative\nstudy of the experiences may throw light on their nature and\norigin. Each carefully observed case may have features of its\nown confirming or contradicting some previous hypothesis or\nsuggesting new considerations. For instance, the interesting\ncase- read by Professor Barrett at the last meeting (see Journcd,\nVol. XIII. p. 228) differs in some important respects from any\nthat\u2014so far as I remember\u2014we have received before. What is\nto be desired is that the Society should be widely understood\nto be the repository to which accounts of well-evidenced veridical\nhallucinations should be sent as soon after their occurrence as\npossible, and I think members of the Society might help more\nthan they do tq bring this state of things about. One of the\nadvantages of a society is that it may bring us into touch with\na wider circle, and therefore with more persons having experi-\nences than would be possible for any one working alone.\nBut it may be asked\u2014how many cases ought we to expect to\nreceive, and is it reasonable to expect more than are now sent\nto us ? It is not of course possible to answer this question\nexactly, but some light is thrown on it by the \u201c Census of\nHallucinations.\u201d It appears {Proceedings, Vol. X. p. 242) that\namong the 17,000 persons who answered the census question\napparitions representing a dead or dying person within 12 hours\nof the death were reported to have occurred to percipients over\nthe age of 10 on eleven different occasions during the previous\nten years. From this we may infer that from a circle of 17,000\npersons such occurrences are likely to be heard of at the rate\nof about one a year. The census enquiry closed in May 1892\u2014\nsixteen years ago. I have looked through the Journal to see\nhow many cases of the above type, sufficiently well evidenced\nto print, have been reported to us during these 16 years. I\nfind that there are eight, including one in which it is not certain\n\f8 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthat the person whose apparition was seen had not been dead\nfor more than 12 hoursd Eight in 16 years is about half the\ncensus proportion, and what makes it worse is that only two of\nthese cases belong to the last ten years\u2014the period from 1898\nto 1908.\nOf course other interesting spontaneous veridical cases have\nbeen printed in the Journal since 1892. I do not mean that\nthere are only seven interesting experiences in all. I select a\nparticular well-defined class because this facilitates numerical\ncomparison ;\nand if we have received fewer than we might\nreasonably expect of this class\u2014a specially interesting one\u2014it\nis probable that other classes are inadequately represented also.\nI must, however, in fairness admit at this point that of the\neleven \u201c census \u201d cases just mentioned only seven, or about two-\nthirds, were judged sufficiently well evidenced to print\u2014and\nthat probably to make the statistical comparison accurate some\nadditions for insufficiently evidenced cases ought to be made to\nthe eight printed in the Journal since 1892. At the same time\nwe must remember that there ought now to be a more widely\nspread understanding of the importance of making the evidence\ngood than there was in the comparatively dark ages before\nPhantasms of the lAving was published, and that consequently\nfewer cases should be lost through carelessness. However, we\ncannot expect perfection, and probably some cases have been\nso lost.\nI do not wish to lay too much stress on the numbers I have\ngiven. With so rare a phenomenon and such short periods we\ncannot of course expect a constant proportion. I think, however,\nthat we may infer that at least as regards apparitions at the time\nof death we do not draw from so large a circle as the 17,000\nwho answered the census question. You will perhaps say that\nit is unreasonable on my part to expect that we should, because\nwhen answers to the census question were collected a special\neffort was made, and we are not likely to be generally in touch\nwith anything like so large a circle. I cannot agree with this\n\u2014\nat least I certainly think we might spread our net more widely\nthan we do. There are now 1138 members and associates of\n'The eight cases will be found as follows :\n\u2014\nJournal, Vol. VI. p. 280 ; p. 368 ;\nVol. VII. p. 121 ;\nVol. VIII. p. 41 ;\nVol. IX. p. 306 ;\nVol. XII. p. 59 ;\nVol. XIII.\np. 103 ; p. -234.\n\fLVII.] Presidential Address. 9\nthe Society, and if they were all sufficiently interested to exert\nthemselves as much as some of them do they could surely\neffectively reach a numher of persons approaching the 17,000\nwho were asked the census question by 410 collectors.\nI may take this opportunity of allaying a suspicion which\nI think exists in the minds of some members\u2014the suspicion,\nnamely, that well-evidenced cases are sent to the Society, which,\nthrough the perversity of the Editor of the Journal, or false\neconomy on the part of the Council, are not printed. This is\nfar from being the case. Well-evidenced cases are always printed,\nexcept in the very rare instances in which onr informants ask\nus not to print. It is true, however, that we have somewhat\nraised our standard, especially in the matter of the interval\nbetween experience and record ;\nand I think it is true also that\n\u2014the kind of evidence required being better understood than\nit used to be\u2014fewer badly-evidenced cases are sent to us now\nthan formerly. Cases which cannot be brought up to a useful\nevidential standard ought not, of course, to be printed by the\nSociety ;\nthough some of them are worth storing in view of\npossible evidential improvement, or because they belong to a\nclass\u2014such as some haunted house cases, or some doubtfully\nveridical experiences of living percipients\u2014which may become\nimportant through possible future experiences or developments.\nThere would doubtless be differences of opinion as to what\nstandard a case should reach to make it worth printing, but I\ndo not think that any competent judge would be likely either\nto regard the evidential standard adopted in the Journal as too\nhigh, or to think any imprinted cases clearly above it.\nBefore I leave this subject let me again express the hope that\nmembers will increase their efforts to get on the track of\ninteresting cases, and to bring them up to as complete an\nevidential standard as possible.\nThere is one department of the Society\u2019s activities in which\nhardly any real progress has been made\u2014I mean the investiga-\ntion of the physical phenomena of spiritualism, or I may say\nfor shortness, telekinesis. So far as I can judge, this subject\nstands almost exactly where it did 26 years ago, when the\nSociety was founded. The first President of the Society said in\nhis first presidential address that it was \u201c a scandal that the dis-\npute as to the reality of these phenomena should be still going\n\f10 iMrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\non,\u201d and that it was a primary aim of the Society \u201c to make a\nsustained and systematic attempt to remove the scandal in one\nway or the other.\u201d Nevertheless, the scandal remains. On the\none hand the phenomena are still swamped in fraud, and so har\nas they are reported to us still occur for the most part in the\npresence of professional mediums who are sooner or later\ndetected in trickery : and, on the other hand, evidence continues\nto be offered from time to time which cannot be disregarded\nowing either to our confidence in the skill and judgment of the\npersons offering it and their experience in this kind of investi-\ngation, or in a few cases to the moral trustworthiness of all\nconcerned.\nThere are, of course, some results from the various investiga-\ntions that have been carried on. On the negative side, besides an\nextended experience of trickery and credulity, we have acquired\n\u2014\nlargely through the work of Mr. S. J. Davey and Dr. Hodgson\n\u2014\na much more definite experimental knowledge of the possibilities\nof mal-observation than we possessed when the Society was\nfounded. Also our greatly extended knowledge of motor auto-\nmatism has shown us that the possibility of sub-conscious\nmuscular action\u2014even very complicated action\u2014has to be\nreckoned with more than we knew in 1882. On the positive\nside we have, as I have said, the conviction of a few persons\nwhose judgment cannot be ignored, that they have seen genuine\nphenomena even with professional mediums ;\nand a few cases\nlike that of Mr. Stainton Moses (though his case, by the way,\noccurred before the Society started), where there is great\nimprobability of conscious deception, and where unconscious\nautomatic action has at least not been discovered. I cannot,\nhowever, myself feel confident that in these cases the possi-\nbilities of error have been sufficiently excluded, or that a\nconclusion either way is at present justified. There is still\n\u2014\nto use a phrase with which we were all very familiar in\nthe early days of the Society\u2014a prima facie case for\ninvestigation.\nHow then can the investigation be furthered ? In the first\nplace I should like to urge strongly that fraud should be more\nseriously discouraged than it is at present. I cannot help\nthinking that if telekinesis is a genuine phenomenon we could\nnot but have known more about it by now than we do, had\n\fLVii.] Presidenticd Address. 11\nit not been for the extent to which it is mixed up with fraud.\nAnd the reason there is so much fraud is that it pays so well.\nAs a rule the fraudulent medium runs no serious risk even of\nloss of credit through discovery. Between the credulous and\nthe curious the medium who has been exposed is as much\nin demand after exposure as before. If every medium dis-\ncovered in systematic trickery could be at once dropped and\nignored, the disgusting trade of fraudulent mediumship would\nsoon cease to be profitable, and the ground of investigation\n\u2014\nassuming that there are genuine phenomena to investigate\n\u2014\nwould be considerably cleared. Of course this is a cpiestiou\nof policy, and there are leading members of the Society, as well\nas many outside it, who do not agree with me. For myself,\nhowever, I feel strongly that as things are no evidence for\ntelekinesis obtained with professional mediums is likely to\nproduce any permanent impression on the scientific world.\nOne of the evils arising from the trickery pervading physical\nmediumship, and the bad name consequently attaching to it, is\nthat private persons who suspect in themselves telekinetic powers\nare apt to be deterred from pursuing the subject. It was one\nof the hopes of the founders of the Society that private\nmediums would be encouraged to come forward and give their\nassistance in investigation. In other branches of our enquiry\nthis has happened, and progress has been largely due to the\nintelligent and energetic interest in the phenomena and their\norigin and cause taken by persons who have found themselves\npossessed of telepathic or other psychical faculties. But in\ntelekinesis practically no disinterested person has come forward\nin this country apparently possessing the power and at the\nsame time taking a scientific interest in its investigation suffi-\ncient to carry them through the tedium of careful experiment.\nGiven an investigator with telekinetic power the simplest\nmanifestations of it \u2014such as movements of small objects\nwithout contact\u2014would lend themselves best to satisfactory\ninvestigation in the first instance. Possibly it might be best\nto approach them through automatic movements with contact,\nwhich are by no means uncommon, and to try to develop these\ninto movements without contact, but there are of course dangers\nof self-deception in this course. In any case what is wanted\nis numerous experiments without contact under carefully planned\n\f12 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nconclitioDS calculated first to exclude all known physical\nexplanations and all possibility of hallucination, and secondly\nto throw light on the mechanical nature of the phenomenon,\nwhere the reaction is, and so forth. I am, of course, saying\nnothing new in saying this ;\nbut it is worth repeating, for\nevidence of this kind and a good deal of it is the minimum\nwhich is likely to produce any permanent effect.\nAnother line of investigation I should like to see pursued\nin this connection is on the negative side\u2014it is investigation\ninto the question of the occurrence of sensory hallucinations\nunder conditions similar to those of s&nces for physical phenomena.\nThe importance in scientific investigations of eliminating the\npossibility of subjective illusion and hallucination may be illus-\ntrated from other branches of research than ours. The history\nof the X-rays is instructive in this way. The supposed dis-\ncovery of these rays was referred to by Professor Eichet, in his\naddress as President of this Society in February, 1905, as an\nexample of the difficulty in certain cases of arriving either at\na positive or a negative conclusion even about facts alleged\nto be demonstrable by experimental evidence which could be\nrepeated at will. Their history has lessons for us in relation\nto our own investigations in more ways than one, and I will\nventure brielly to recall some of the circumstances to your\nminds.\nIt was in 1903 that Professor Blondlot, a French physicist\nof repute, observed, while investigating Eontgen rays, some\neffects which he attributed to a hitherto unobserved kind of\nradiation having a vibratory character like light and heat, and\nto which he gave the name of N-rays. He even thought a\nlittle later that he could, by suitable arrangements, measure\ntheir wave length approximately.^ They emanated, according\nto his observation, from a variety of sources, among others\nfrom certain metals and other substances in a state of strain\n;\nand presently a physiological colleague, Professor Charpentier,\nreported that they also emanated from the muscles (when\ncontracted) and the active nerve centres of living bodies.\nIMany remarkable properties of these rays were reported one\nafter another almost every week in the early part of 1904,\nand hopes were raised that the discovery would prove a source\n^Gomptes Eenclus, Vol. CXXXVIII.

Naturally physicists\nall over the world tried to repeat the experiments, but though\na few said the effects to be observed were marked and unmis-\ntakable, the majority of those who tried could not see the\ndifferences described at all. It is true that photographs\nexhibiting differences in the luminosity of a small electric\nspark when believed to be exposed to N-rays were offered\nby Professor Blondlot as proof of the objectivity of the\nphenomenon ;\nbut others failed to get similar photographs\nunder satisfactory conditions, and in any case such photographs\nwould not have gone very far towards proving the existence\nof rays with the peculiar properties claimed for N-rays. The\ncontinued non-success of so many skilled experimenters in\nrepeating the experiments could not but suggest that in the\nsuccessful experiments enough care had not been taken to\nexclude personal and subjective elements\u2014to make sure that\nthe observations were in no way influenced by the observers\u2019\nexpectations.\n^\nSome of those who had unsuccessfully endeavoured to repeat\nthe experiments took opportunities of visiting laboratories in\nwhich the observations had been made, and when shown the\n^Professor Salvioni of Messina published in July, 1904, some experiments\non himself, which led him gravely to suspect that in his own previous\nrepetition of Professor Blondlot\u2019s observations auto-suggestion and optical\nillusion played an important part. [Atti della reale Academia dei Lyncei,\nJuly 19, 1904, xiii. No. 12 p. 703.) He was unable to carry out his experi-\nments as completely as he would have desired, because he found himself no\nlonger able to see as clearly as before the variations in apparent luminosity\nwhich were the subject of experiment. This \u2014if it was, as seems probable, a\nresult of his critical attitude\u2014is perhaps instructive for us in our investigations.\nProfessor Pierre Weiss of Zurich, who had also believed himself to have verified\nsome of the recorded observations, wrote to the Revue Scientifique for Dec. 3,\n1904, an account of experiments which led him to the conclusion that psycho-\nphysiological causes had operated in his case.\n\f14 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nprocesses were confirmed in negative conclusions. One of them\n\u2014\nan American physicist, Professor E. W. Wood\u2014published an\naccount of his experiences.^ The following are some of them.\nPirst he failed to see the supposed brightening of a stream of\nsmall electric sparks when the N-rays were concentrated on it\nby an aluminium lens. His host thought this must be due to\nwant of sensitiveness in his eyes as the difference was most\ndistinct when the X-rays were intercepted by a hand interposed\nbetween their source and the spark. Professor Wood suggested\nthat an attempt should be made, by observing the illumination,\nto announce the exact moment when his hand was introduced\ninto the path of the rays, the observer not having other means\nof knowing whether the hand was there or not. The attempt\nfailed completely ;\nalternating brightness and dimness were\nannounced while the hand was held motionless in the path of\nthe supposed rays, and when the hand was moved the\nfluctuations observed had no relation to the movements.\nHe was afterwards shown the deviation of the rays by an\naluminium prism which was alleged not only to bend the rays\nthrown on it through a slit, but to spread them out into a\nspectrum. The positions of the deflected rays were detected\nby a thin strip of luminous paint moved across them which\nbecame more brilliant at certain points. Professor Wood was\nagain unable to see any change whatever in the brilliancy of\nthe phosphorescent line as it moved across, and he presently\nfound that the secret removal of the prism (the I'oom was\ndark) did not seem to interfere in any way with the observa-\ntions of his host.\nA third experiment consisted in showing that circles painted\nin luminous paint showed more distinctly in a dark room when\na steel file\u2014steel being a source of X-rays\u2014was brought near\nthem. Again Professor Wood could not himself see any effect\nthough it was said to be very marked, and presently he found\nthat when he held the file so that his body\u2014which should\nhave been an effective screen\u2014was between it and the phos-\nphorescent circles, while he moved his arms towards and away\nfrom them, his host still observed the same changes.\nA fourth experiment consisted in holding the fde so that\nthe X-rays from it fell on the eye, whereupon in a nearly\n^ N'ature, Sept. 29, 1904, p. .'i.SO.\n\fLVii.] Presidential Address. lo\ndark room a wliite .dock face bccairxje ^)r 9 re distinctly visible\nthan before. Again Professor Wood saw no difference, but he\nfound that his host\u2019s observation of it was in no way interfered\nwith by the secret substitution for the file of a piece of wood\nof similar size and shape.\nIt is not surprising that Professor Wood, like others, left\nthe laboratory with a firm conviction that the few experi-\nmenters who had obtained positive results in the observations\nof N-rays had been in some way deluded. And while leaving\nthe question whether N-rays have any objective existence or\nnot to the physicists,^ we may safely agree that thei'e certainly\nwas delusion on the occasion of Professor Wood\u2019s visit and\nprofitably examine what the nature of the delusion was.\nSlight variations in sensation, especially on the margin of\nsvhat we can perceive, may and do occur from physiological\ncauses. Professor Plondlot and others concerned were of course\nwell aware of this, and the point of their observations was not\nthat variations in appai\u2019ent brightness occurred, but that these\nvariations which they described as marked coincided with an\nexternal physical event so constantly as to render the conclusion\ninevitable that there was a causal connection. What Professor\nWood showed was that the variations coincided with the idea of\nthe event as readily as with the event itself. The difference of\nsensation was therefore nor purely pliysiologically caused, nor,\non the other hand, was it due to the external physical cause.\nIt was, in fact, a hallucination produced by expectation, though\nno doubt a hallucination of a simple kind.\nI have called your attention to this partly because, as I have\nsaid, I think it possible that visual (and other) hallucinations due\nto suggestion or self-suggestion occur at seances for physical\nphenomena more than we realise. We start with the knowledge\nthat many persons can induce hallucinations by gazing into\ncrystals ;\nthat such hallucinations are sometimes collective, as for\ninstance at a sAxnce of which an interesting account is given in\nthe Journal, Vol. XII. p. 17, when similar figures were seen\nby the four sitters in a large mirror opposite to which tliey sat\n;\nthat at other seances of which we have records certain\nphenomena were clearly of a hallucinatory character whatever\n^ An excellent discussion of the question will be found in the Revue.

Henry Sidgtvick.\ntheir cause that-halluciu,atious of, a dehnite. kiRdlcan be induced\nby suggestion in good hypnotic subjects even in the waking\nstate; and now, from the N-ray experiments, that expectation can\nproduce hallucinations, at least of an elementary sort, in a\ndarkened room in the case of persons in a perfectly normal state.\nFurther investigation and, if possible, experiment is certainly\ncalled for in .this direction. The bearing of the question on the\nevidence for telekinesis is obvious.\nThere is another lesson to be drawn from the story of the\nX-rays. It is not only in the subjects cur Society exists to\ninvestigate that the scientific world is cautious, and has need to\nbe cautious, in accepting conclusions depending on observations\nwhich cannot be repeated by others and checked. It is not mere\nprejudice but the legitimate caution that should be exercised in\nall branches of science that makes scientific men chary of\naccepting as sufficient the evidence so far offered for telekinesis\nor even for telepathy. Tlie hesitation will be overcome if and\nwhen the conditions under which these things occur are dis-\ncovered, so that they can be brought more under control and\nobservations repeated at will under definable conditions ;\nbut in\nthe meanwhile, as I have said, much would be done to remove\nscepticism by careful observation under as many conditions as\npossible.\nI now turn from telekinesis, which is to me the most\ndepressing branch of our investigations, to speak briefly of the\nmost encouraging, that which at present promises the most\nfruitful harvest, namely, telepathy. The Society started with its\nface already set in this direction, and as we all know its efforts\nwere from the first successful, not only in collecting the\nspontaneous experiences apparently due to telepathy to which\n1 have already referred, but in obtaining opportunities for\nexperiment and reports of experiments carefully carried out. It\nis true that it cannot yet be said that the scientific world\ngenerally has admitted telepathy as a fact, but it is not\nuncommon to hear educated persons offering it as a rational\nexplanation of unusual experiences without apirarently any sense\nof invoking an unrecognised cause and even with the feeling that\n^ For some useful information about this matter as well as about the history\nof telekinesis generally, I should like to refer my hearers to Mr. Podmore\u2019s\nexcellent book on Modern Spiritualism.\n\fLVli.] Presidential Address. 17\nthat they are stemming the tide of superstition in not admitting\nanything more occult. Indeed, the acceptance of telepathy is\nwide enough to expose us to a serious danger that persons who\nmight furnish evidence may refrain from doing so because they\nthink the telepathic question is settled and that there is no\nfurther need of observation or experiment. It is fortunate that\nat least some of our members realise the contrary, as the\ninteresting paper (see Journal, Vol. XIII., p. 243) read by Miss\nMiles at our last meeting shows.\nThere are two important reasons why much more evidence is\nrequired. The first is the one already referred to, that in default\nof being able to repeat experiments at will under given\nconditions, we can only establish the truth of telepathy\u2014get it\nadmitted by scientific men as a vera cai(,sa\u2014by showing that it\noccurs between so many different and apparently trustworthy\npersons under so many different conditions that any possibility of\nthe results being due to chance, or self-deception, or unnoticed\nindications, may be excluded by sheer weight of evidence.\nThe second reason for wide experimentation and observation\nis even more important. It is that we do not yet know the\nnature of telepathy. There are two opposing views as to its\nprobable nature among those who accept it as a fact. Some, like\nProfessor Flournoy, approaching the subject from the physio-\nlogical side, believe on a priori grounds that the transmission is\nfrom brain to brain through some physical medium\u2014that it is,\nin fact, more or less analogous to wireless telegraphy. Others,\nlike our late President, approaching the question from the\nphilosophical side, are inclined to regard telepathy as a purely\npsychical phenomenon\u2014a direct interaction of mind with mind.\nIt is in harmony with this second view, if not absolutely\nessential to it, to hold that mind can exist independently of the\nbody, and is therefore capable of surviving the dissolution of the\nlatter. Inve.stigation into the real nature of telepathy is thus\nintimately connected with the most important and far reaching\nproblems involved in our enquiry. If the question is capable of\nscientific determination, however, much more evidence than we\nat present possess will be required, and any evidence we can\nobtain of survival after bodily death is likely to throw light on\nthe nature of telepathy and rice versa.\nThe accumulation of evidence is and must be a slow process,\nB\n\f18 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part lvii.]\nnot only because very few of us seem able to act as agents or\npercipients in a manner which lends itself to observation or\nexperiment, but also because of the experimental difficulties\ninherent in psychical research of which I spoke earlier in this\naddress. Notwithstanding the immense difficulties of the subject,\nhoweve'?', evidence is slowly accumulating, and some progress is\nbeing made. Lately we seem to have made a distinct advance\nthrough the automatic writing of Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. \u201c Holland,\u201d\nand others, and the trance writing of Mrs. Piper, some of which\nhas been put before the Society at several recent meetings, and\nwhich is likely to occupy a large place in the Proceedings for\nsome time to come.\nThe evidence needs careful and critical study; 'it is not of a\nsensational character, it is not likely to make good copy for the\nDaily Mail, and I am not sure how far it will impress the\nmajority of readers. Those, however, who follow the work of the\nSociety carefully will, I think, perceive that in these scripts we\nhave at least material for extending our knowledge of telepathy.\nThey will probably be disposed further to admit that the form\nand matter of the cross-correspondences that occur between the\ndifferent scripts (produced at a distance from one another) afford\nconsiderable ground for supposing the intervention behind the\nautomatists of another mind independent of them. If this be so\nthe question what mind this is becomes of extreme interest and\nimportance. Can it be a mind still in the body ? or have we got\ninto relation with minds which have survived bodily death and\nare endeavouring by means of the cross- correspondences to\nproduce evidence of their operation ? If this last hypothesis be\nthe true one it would mean that intelligent co-operation between\nother than embodied human minds and our own, in experiments\nof a new kind intended to prove continued existence, has become\npossible, and we should be justified in feeling that we are\nentering on a new and very important stage of the Society\u2019s\nwork.\n\fII.\nA SEEIES OF CONCOEDANT AUTOMATISMS.\nBY J. G. PIDDINGTOX.\nIntroduction.\nMrs Piper came to England at the invitation of the Council\nand between November 10, 1906 and June 2, 1907 gave\n74 sittings in all. The management of the sittings was\nentrusted by the Council to a committee composed of the\nEt. Hon. Gr. W. Balfour, then President of the Society, Sir\nOliver Lodge, Mr Podmore, Mrs Sidgwick and myself.\nThe Committee decided that the main object of the experi-\nments to be conducted with Mrs Piper should be to encourage\nthe development of certain controls which had already been\nmanifesting in her trance\u2014namely, those giving themselves the\nnames of Henry Sidgwick, Frederic Myers, and Eichard Hodgson\n\u2014and also to endeavour to bring about experimentally the\nkind of phenomenon to which the name of cross-correspondence\nhas been given.\nOf the upshot of the first of these two objects I will confine\nmyself here to saying that the Sidgwick control played but a\nminor part ;\nthe Hodgson control showed much activity as\na go-between or master of the ceremonies, as it were, but\ngave little evidence of identity and did not, I think, fully\nmaintain the lifelike character of its earlier manifestations in\nAmerica ;\nwhile the Myers control, which had formerly been\nlacking in dramatic vitality, displayed a marked advance, par-\nticularly in the vraisemUance of the personation.\nIt is chiefly with the second of our main objects, the ex-\nperiments in cross-correspondence, that this paper deals.\n\f20 J. G. Piddington. [part\nThe first 13 sittings were held at Liverpool or Edgbaston\nunder the direction of Sir Oliver Lodge. Then came 58 sittings\nin London, I being in charge on 35 occasions, Mrs Sidgwick\non 19, and Miss Johnson on two towards the end of the series;\nand Mr E. N. Bennett, M.P. had two sittings to himself as a\nsec|uel to a successful first sitting which he had had at Boston\nshortly before Mrs Piper\u2019s departure for England. The last\nthree sittings were given in Edgbaston, whence Mrs Piper went\nto Scotland for a few weeks\u2019 holiday before returning home.\nAll the London sittings, with the exception of five held at\nMrs Piper\u2019s flat, took place in the Smoking-room of the Irish\nLiterary Society at 20 Hanover Square, which we had rented\nfor this purpose. As regards the London sittings,- the person\nin charge of the sitting was present before the trance began\nand remained until Mrs Piper had regained normal conscious-\nness. In no case did the sitter enter the seance-room or come\nin contact with Mrs Piper until she was fully entranced, and,\nexcept where noted, the sitter left the room before the end of\nthe trance, and did not come in contact again with Mrs Piper\nuntil the next or some subsequent trance was already in progress.\nIn all about 120 experiments in cross-correspondence were\nmade. I cannot give the precise number because the trance-\npersonalities, when it fell to them to announce the inception\nor accomplish.ment of an experiment, did not always state ex-\nplicitly that a cross-correspondence had been intended, and also\nbecause in several instances they appear to have combined two\nor more messages into one which had at first been given\nseparately. But the exact total is of little importance, for a\nconsiderable proportion of the coincidences ai\u2019e of far too definite\na character to be accounted for by chance, whatever the pro-\nportion of failures, and so the application of any rigorous\nstatistical metliod is uncalled for. Besides Mrs Piper, the\nautomatists concerned in these experiments were Mrs Verrall,\nMiss Helen Verrall, Mrs Thompson, and the two ladies known\nto the members of our Society under the pseudonyms of Mrs\nEorbes and Mrs Holland.\nMrs Verrall liad ten sittings with Mrs Piper, Miss Verrall\nfive, and Mrs Eorbes four ;\nand exactly the same precautions\nwere observed with them as with the other sitters. They did\nnot enter the seance-room till the trance had begun, and they\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 21\nleft it before Mrs Piper had recovered her normal conscious-\nness ;\nand they did not hold any intercourse or communication\nwith Mrs Piper except at these sittings.\nMrs Thompson\u2019s participation was unfortunately very brief,\nbeing, I regret to say, abruptly terminated in consequence of\nthe unexpected death of her husband after a few days\u2019 illness.\nMrs Forbes was informed of the experiments a few weeks\nafter they started, but she did not set herself systematically\nand regularly to write automatically, and in fact produced only\na few pieces of script, and these show no coincidences with\nthe scripts of the other automatists.\nThe subject of cross-correspondence experiments was first\nmooted by Sir Oliver Lodge at the sitting with Mrs Piper\nheld on Nov. 15, 1906 ;\nand Mrs Piper gave her last sitting\non June 2, 1907.\nThe experiments in cross-correspondence, then, extended over\nthe period Nov. 15, 1906\u2014June 2, 1907.\nDuring this period Mrs Verrall produced in all 63 pieces\nof script on 59 different days, the first piece being written\non Nov. 16, 1906 and the last on May 13, 1907. After\nMay 13 she did not do any more automatic writing for nearly\n5 weeks.\nDuring the period Nov. 15, 1906\u2014June 2, 1907 Miss\nVerrall produced 17 pieces of script on 17 different days,\nthe first being written on Nov. 20, 1906 and the last on\nMay 26, 1907. After May 26 she did not write automati-\ncally again till July.\nBetween Nov. 15, 1906 and July 10, 1907 Mrs Holland\nproduced 38 pieces of script on 38 different days. I have\nextended the period beyond June 2, 1907 in Mrs Holland\u2019s\ncase, not because that portion of her script which was pro-\nduced subsequently to the termination of the Piper sittings\nshows any coincidences with Mrs Piper\u2019s script or trance-\nutterances, but simply because there was no such definite or\nprolonged break in her automatic output as there was in Mrs\nand Miss Yerrall\u2019s.\nFor the purposes, then, of comparison between the automa-\ntisms of Mrs Piper, Mrs Verrall, Miss Verrall and Mrs\nHolland, I take the following periods: Nov. 15, 1906\u2014June 2,\n1907 (Mrs Piper); Nov. 16, 1906\u2014May 13, 1907 (Mrs\n\f22 J. G. Piddington. [part\nVerrall); Kov. 20, 1906\u2014May 26, 1907 (Miss Verrall); and\nNov. 21, 1906\u2014July 10, 1907 (Mrs Holland). These periods\nI shall from time to time refer to in the course of this paper\nas \u201c the periods under review \u201d.\nBoth Mrs and Miss Verrall knew of the experiments with\nMrs Piper; but until the middle of March 1907 Mrs Holland\nwas entirely unaware that any such experiments were being\nconducted.\nMiss Verrall\u2019s 17 pieces of script were written at irregular\ndates and hours, except on two occasions when the hours were\npreconcerted to synchronise with Mrs Piper\u2019s trance.\nWith Mrs Verrall a more systematic plan was followed\n;\n27 pieces of her script having been written, mostly by previous\narrangement, either just before or during Mrs Piper\u2019s trances.\nThe Piper sittings took place, as already stated, eitlier in\nLondon, Liverpool or Edgbaston. Mrs Verrall\u2019s script was done\nat Cambridge or Matlock Bath, with the exception of 3 pieces\nwritten in London, 7 in the train between Cambridge and\nLondon and one at Brighton. Of Miss Verrall\u2019s script 14\npieces were clone at Cambridge, 2 at Brighton, and one piece\nat Edgbaston. Her visit to Edgbaston did not coincide with\nMrs Piper\u2019s. Mrs Holland was throughout in India.\nThe script of Mrs Verrall and that of Miss Verrall were\nsent to me up to April 5, 1907, and after that date to Miss\nJohnson. We in every case noted either on the envelope or\non the script itself the date and hour at which it reached us.\nMrs Holland\u2019s script was sent to Miss Johnson, who\nendorsed each script with the date of its arrival.\nMrs Holland remained throughout the entire series of experi-\nments in absolute ignorance of what was written by the other\nautoniatists. So likewise did Mrs Piper, unless it be that she\nremembers in her normal state things said to her during her\ntrances ;\nand even then the evidential value of the results\nwould be unaffected, for all she could have learnt in this way\nwas either that an experiment had been successfully accom-\nplished or that it had failed. Mrs Verrall saw at various\ndates certain portions of Mrs Holland\u2019s and of Miss Verrall\u2019s\nscript; and Miss Verrall read or was informed of a few\npassages in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script. Careful note was taken at the\ntime of the extent of the knowledge thus normally acquired\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Aiitomatisms. 23\nand of the dates on which it was acquired by Mrs and Miss\nVerrall.\nIt need hardly be said that I shall not bring forward as\nevidence of supernormal reciprocation any coincidences which\ncan be explained by Mrs Verrall\u2019s normal knowledge of parts\nof Mrs Holland\u2019s or of Miss Verrall\u2019s script, or by Miss\nVerrall\u2019s normal knowledge of parts of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script.\nThe word or sentence given to the Piper trance-personalities\nfor reproduction by them through one or more of the other\nautomatists was selected in eighteen cases by those in charge\nof the sittings : five times by Sir Oliver Lodge, eleven times\nby myself, and twice by Mrs Sidgwick. Piather over a\nhundred subjects for experiment were chosen by the trance-\npersonalities : one by Imperator, two by Prudens, three by\nEector, 61 by \u201cMyers,\u201d 21 by \u201cHodgson,\u201d 6 by \u201cSidgwick,\u201d\none by \u201c G. P.,\u201d and in a few cases the choice was not\nattributed to any special control.\nOf the 18 words or phrases selected by the experimenters\nonly one can be said with certainty to have been successfully\ntransferred. Of the success achieved in the transmission of\nmessages chosen by the trance-personalities themselves it would\nbe idle to attempt to speak in general terms. Each case where\ncomplete or partial or possible success was attained must be\ndescribed and studied in detail. I shall deal with the cross-\ncorrespondences in chronological order : that is to say, in the\norder in which they were first referred to in the Piper trance.\nIn the extracts from the records of Mrs Piper\u2019s sittings\nprinted in small type I have reproduced the abbreviations,\npunctuation and other peculiarities of the trance-script. When,\nhowever, quotations from the records occur in passages printed\nin large type, I have usually revised the punctuation and\nwritten out in full the abbreviated words. I have in many\ncases omitted questions asked by the sitter about undeciphered\nwords and the subsequent explanations of the trance-person-\nalities, and these omissions are usually, though not invariably,\nindicated thus But I have in no case omitted any\nsuch passages unless they were entirely unimportant and had\nno possible \u2018\nevidential \u2019\nbearing.\nPrevious reports on the trance-phenomena of Mrs Piper have\nappeared in Proc., Yol. VI., pp. 436-659 ;\nVol. VIII., pp. 1-167;\n\f24 J. G. Piddington. [part\nVol. XIII., pp. 284-582; Vol. XIV., pp. 6-78; and Vol. XVI.,\npp. 1-649. Proc. Vol. XX., pp. 1-432, contains a report by\nMrs Verrall on her own automatic writings ;\nand Proc. Vol.\nXXI., pp. 166-391, a report by Miss Alice Johnson on Mrs\nHolland\u2019s.\nXor an explanation of the parts played in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance\nby \u201c Imperator \u201d, \u201c Eector \u201d and \u201c Prudens \u201d the reader is re-\nferred to Proc. Vol. XIII., pp. 408-9, and Vol. XVI., p. 15.\nThe external features of Mrs Piper\u2019s trance may be briefly\ndescribed as follows :\n\u2014Mrs Piper sits at a table with a pile of\ncushions in front of her, and composes herself to go into\ntrance. After an interval varying I'rom 2 or 3 to 1 0 minutes\nher head drops on the cushions with the face turned to the\nleft and the eyes closed, her right hand falling at the same\ntime on to a small table placed on her right side. A pencil\nis put between her fingers, and the hand proceeds to write.\nThe writing being done without the aid of sight and with\nthe arm in a more or less strained position is often difficult\nto decipher, at least without practice ;\nbut in spite of its not\nbeing easy to read, it is remarkably consistent in character, so\nthat, its peculiarities once grasped, the correct interpretation of\nall but a very few words is not a matter of conjecture. The\ncoming out of trance is a longer process than the going into\ntrance. After the hand has ceased to write the medium\nremains quiescent for a few minutes. She tlien raises herself\nslowly, and often with difficulty, from the cushions. When\nthe body is erect, she begins to speak. Her utterance at first\nis usually indistinct, but as she gradually regains her normal\ncondition it becomes clearer. All the sittings which Mrs Piper\ngave in England were, with one exception, \u201c writing \u201d and not\n\u201c voice \u201d sittings : that is to say, her automatism took the form\nof writing and not of speech, except during the waking-stage.\nThe \u201c writing \u201d sittings possess one great advantage over the\n\u201c voice \u201d sittings, namely, that the automatic phenomena which\noccur at them by their very nature record themselves.\nThe remarks made by the sitters it was our habit to note\ndown on the sheets of paper on which the entranced Mrs\nPiper wrote ;\nand these sheets have of course been preserved.\nAs soon as possible after the conclusion of the trance the\nexperimenter in charge of the sitting made a full manuscript\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 25\ncopy both of what Mrs Piper had written and of the notes\nof what the sitters had said. This copy\u2014which is spoken of\nas \u201c the record \u201d\n\u2014was annotated by the experimenter and\nafterwards typewritten, and, in cases where there had been\nanother person present at the sitting besides the experimenter,\nsubmitted to this person for the insertion of such comments\nand explanations as seemed necessary. The trance-script was\nalways kept out of Mrs Piper\u2019s sight and taken away at the\nend of the sitting, so that she never saw it or had access\nto it at any time. In her normal condition she neither asked\nfor nor received any information whatever about what had\nhappened at the sittings, except that she was occasionally told\nthat the results were considered interesting and promising, and\nthat they were of a different nature from what had previously\nbeen obtained. Since thei\u2019e is strong ground for believing that\nin her normal state she remembers absolutely nothing of what\nhas occurred in the trance state, it would seem impossible that\nin the intervals between the sittings she could have got up any\ninformation bearing on them, even had she wished to do so.\nMiss Newton, the assistant secretary of the Society, was\npresent at the beginning and end of several sittings. There were\ntwo reasons for her attendance:\u2014(1) As the controls objected\nto Mrs Piper\u2019s being left alone when in trance, and as the sitter\nwas not allowed to see Mrs Piper until ^le was entranced, it\nwas necessary to have someone besides the experimenter in\nthe seance-room, who could go out and tell the sitter when\nit was time to come in. (2) Mrs Piper\u2019s utterances during\nthe waking-stage often cannot be heard unless one stands with\none\u2019s ear close to her mouth (and often not even then) ;\nand\nwhen experience had taught us that it was difficult to do this\nand to record at the same time, we thought it desirable to\nhave a second person present, who could stand close to Mrs\nPiper and report her indistinct utterances to the recorder.\nBeyond what she could learn during these brief and occasional\nattendances.

Yes, quite right.\nI will go at once.\n\u201c St. Paul \u201d did not appear in Mrs Holland\u2019s script. There\nare, however, in the script of Miss Verrall two passages worth\nconsidering in this connection.\n^\nThe two passages in question occur in Miss Verrall\u2019s script\nof Jan. 12 and Feb. 26, 1907. The script of Jan. 12 opens\nwith a sentence in Latin, and then totally unconnected with it\nfollow these words :\n\u2014\nthe name is not right robbing Peter to pay \u2014Paul 1\nsanctus nomine quod efficit nil continens petatur sub-\nveniet.\nThe script of Feb. 26 reads as follows:\n\u2014\nA tangle of flowers with green grass between wall flowers\npansies why such hurry did you know that the second\nwa}^ was shorter you have not understood about Paul\nask Lodge, quibus eruditis advocatis rem explicabis non\nnisi ad unam normam refers hoc satis alia vana\na tower of ancient masonry with battlements\n(\na scrawl, perhaps \\\nrepresenting a signature 1 astolat.\n\u201cA.^T.\u201d \/\n\u2019 I consider myself Justified in looking for a correspondence in the script of\nan automatist other than the one to whom the message was directed, because\nthe trance-personalities were more than once and in the most formal and\ndefinite terms asked to try to give tliese corresponding messages to all or any\nof the automatists concerned in these experiments, even though only one was\nspecifically named when the experiment was arranged. To a critical mind the\nreflection will at once occur that the chances of success were hereby increased.\nI agree ;\nbut I will content myself with saying that if any serious critic will\ncarefully study all the evidence presented in this report I shall not be afraid\nof his seeking to set down the successful cases of correspondence to chance in\nspite of the way in which the chances of success to the extent here stated\nwere widened.\n\fLYii.] A Series of Concordant Automudisnis. 33\nThe last sentence and tlie opening phrases down to \u201cshorter\u201d\nseem to me clearly not to belong to the middle passages, the\nsubject of which is dismissed with the words \u201c this is enough\n;\nmore is useless\nThe Latin words in the script of Jan. 12 I interpret\nthus :\n\u2014\u201c Holy in name (i.e. with the title of saint) what she\n(or, he) is doing is of no use (i.e. by itself). Let the point\n(continens) be looked for; it will help\u201d.\nThe Latin words of Feb. 26 I translate;\n\u2014\u201cBy calling to\nyour aid what learned men will you explain the matter ?\n^\n(You will not explain it) unless you refer it to one standard.\nThis is enough ;\nmore is useless\u201d.\nThe only reference to Sir Oliver Lodge in Miss Verrall\u2019s\nscript during the period under review is the one quoted above.\nThe names Peter and Paul do not occur elsewhere in Miss\nVerrall\u2019s script during the same period. It is natural, therefore,\nto put together the two scripts containing the name Paul.\nIf we take these two passages to refer to the experiment\narranged on Xov. 15, it will be seen that the name Paul is\ngiven ;\nand that \u201c Lodge \u201d is correctly indicated as the person\nto explain about the name Paul. Miss Verrall never did\napply to Sir Oliver Lodge as directed ;\nand it was not\nuntil September 1907 that the interpretation given above\nstruck me.\nI have said that \u201cSt. Paul\u201d did not appear in Mrs.\nHolland\u2019s script, but her script of Dec. 31, 1906 suggests an\napproach to the name of St. Paul, and also suggests an\nexplanation of the words in Miss Verrall\u2019s script of Jan. 12,\n\u201c the name is not right robbing Peter to pay\u2014Paul\u201d.\nI transcribe the first half only of this script of Dec. 31,\n1906: the second half having no connection with the first.\nII Peter L, 15. [\u201cMoreover I will endeavour that ye may\nbe able after my decease to have these things always in\nremembrance.\u201d] ^\n^ Or, if \u201c quibiis \u201d is treated as a relative instead of as an interrogative,\nthe words would mean :\n\u201c when yon have called these learned persons to your\naid\u201d.\n'Explanatory comments, translations, etc. are throughout enclosed, as here,\nin square brackets.\nC\n\f34 J. G. Picldington. [part\n\u201cThis witness is true\u201d\n\u2014\nIt is now time that the shadow should be lifted from .your\nspirit\u2014\u201cLet patience have her perfect work\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201c This is a faithful saying \u201d\n\u2014\nThis wit'iiess etc. is not, I believe, a textual quotation, but\nis reminiscent of several passages in the writings of St. John.\nLet patience etc. is a quotation from the Epistle of St. James.\nThis is CO faithful saying occurs at least three times in St.\nPaul\u2019s Epistles.\nThe only name actually written is Peter, and this Peter is\nclearly Paint Peter. If we suppose that the scribe was aiming\nat getting \u201c St. Paul \u201d expressed, it looks as if he felt his way\ntowards the name or notion of St. Paul by quoting first from\nSt. Peter, next from St. John, then from St. Janies and finally\nfrom St. Paul. I do not mean that I think the process was\nthus deliberately involved, but that the scribe (whoever or\nwhatever that may be) did the best he could. A long way\nround may perhaps be the only way there. I further suggest\nthat the scribe having got so far could not proceed to get the\nname \u201c St. Paul \u201d written, and so had to content himself with a\nquotation from his writings.\nNow, read in the light of this interpretation, the words in\nMiss Verrall\u2019s script of Jan. 12, \u201cthe name is not right\nrobbing Peter to pay\u2014Paul\u201d, are suggestive.\nThe words nisi ad tmarn normetm refers in Miss A^errall\u2019s\nsci'ipt of Feb. 26 may, perhaps, have been intended to mean\nthat unless there was one person in touch with all the auto-\nmatists concerned in these experiments the point would be\nmissed in many instances; or in other words, that a central\nexchange was necessary. In this case I was, so to speak, at\nthe central office, but though I was receiving IMiss A^errall\u2019s\nscript, and though Sir Oliver Lodge sent me a copy of his\nrecord of the sitting of Nov. 15, I was not receiving a copy\nof Mrs Holland\u2019s script ;\nand until I did receive a copy of\nit the significance of Miss Verrall\u2019s scripts of Jan. 12 and\nFeb. 2 6 naturally escaped me. If then the words nisi acl\n7inum iiormam refers can bear such an interpretation as I\nhave sought to place on them, they were neither otiose nor\nmere padding.\n\fLvii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. \u2019^o\nMost readers who have had the patience to follow rne so\nfar will, I fear, at this point form the opinion that all this\nmay be more or less ingenious rubbish, but that it is certainly\nrubbish. Had our experiments produced no coincidences less\nproblematical than this one, I should heartily agree ;\nbut there\nhave been correspondences of the most definite character, and\nnot only that, but in the production of them there is evidence\nboth of intelligent direction and of ingenuity. I care not to\nwhom that intelligence be attributed ;\nbut that intelligence\nand acute intelligence lie behind the phenomena I stoutly\nmaintain. And if this be once admitted, no excuse need be\noffered for trying to place upon them interpretations which\notherwise would be over-subtle.\nII.\n\u201cFEANCIS AND IGNATIUS\u201d.\nOn Jan. 2, 1907 at 12.30 p.m. Calcutta time (i.e. 6.30\na.m. Greenwich time) Mrs Holland wrote a script containing\nthe names Francis and Ignatius ;\nand neither of these names\noccurs again in her script during the period under review.\nSome five or six hours later, at the sitting held with Mrs\nPiper on Jan. 2, I asked Imperator if he objected to my\nasking MyerSp if he remembered what was Imperator\u2019s real\nname as given through Stainton Moses ;\nand Imperator replied\nthat he had no objection. I then asked Pmctor to tell me\nhis real name, and after a few minutes Eector said his name\nwas Francis. The question about Imperator\u2019s name was put\nto MyerSp on April 8, and MyerSp replied that he could not\nremember the name of Imperator as given through Stainton\nMoses, but thought it was something like St. Ignatius ;\nand\nhe then spontaneously asked whether the name of one of\nMrs Piper\u2019s controls was not Francis.\n\f36 J. G. Pidclington. [part\nI am disposed to regard these coincidences as accidental.\nBut whether they be so or not, at any rate before pro-\nnouncing a definite opinion it is necessary to discover whether\nthe names Ignatius and Francis had previously been assigned\nto Imperator and Eector respectively in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance-\ncommunications. To discover this involves an examination of\nall the many unpublished records of Mrs Piper\u2019s sittings ;\nand\nas this examination will not be completed for a long time, I\ndefer for the present discussing in detail this possible instance\nof cross-correspondence.\nIII.\n\u201cTPJANGLE WITHIN A CIECLE.\u201d\nExt7\u2019cict from record of sitting vntli Mrs PiiKr held on Jem. 16,\n1907 .\n(Present : J.

Myers, when you send a message to, say, Mrs Verrall, and\nthen a similar message to Mrs Holland, could you not\nmark each with some simple but distinctive sign 1\nI am not cpiite sure that I U.D. you do you mean when I\ngive a message to make a sign after or before the written\nmessage ?\nJ. G. P. Yes; if you wrote, for instance, \u201csunshine\u201d through Mrs\nVerrall and then afterwards through Mrs Holland, you\nmight put, say, a triangle within a circle, or some simple\nsign like that, to show that there is another message to\nbe looked for corresponding with the message so marked.\n\flvil] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 37\nI think I U.D. you wish me to make a sign when giving\na word at Mrs Verralls also at Mrs Hollamls\u2019\nJ.

It certainly would lie.\nA circle with a triangle inside it appeared in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript of Jan. 28 at the foot of a remarkable conununication\nembodying a successful cross-correspondence, which will be\ndealt with in detail in Section VI. Mrs Holland\u2019s script does\nnot contain any drawing of a circle with a triangle inside\nit ;\nthough on May 8 she has these drawings of geometrical\nfigures.\nO\nMrs Verrall\u2019s drawing is, however, quite unmistakable ;\nand\nit was attached, as requested, to a script which contained a\ncross-correspondence. The cross-correspondence was between\nMrs Verrall, Miss Verrall and YIrs Piper. That Mrs Holland\nwas not concerned in it in no degree detracts from the success,\nfor when suggesting the experiment to Myersp I mentioned\nMrs Holland (and for that matter Mrs Verrall also) only by\nway of exemplification. This was the only experiment chosen\nby the experimenters which certainly succeeded. It may be\nthat it succeeded because, unpromising though such a subject\nmay seem, the circle and triangle may have had a significance\n\f.38 J. G. Piddington. [PAKT\nof a poetical nature which appealed to the emotions of\nthe Myers personality ;\nand the circle certainly fitted in\nmost happily and appropriately with the communication to\nwhich it was appended. In later sittings MyerSp indicated\nwith sufficient clearness, if not as explicitly as could have\nbeen wished, the particular piece of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script which\nhad been marked with the triangle and circle. These points\nwill be further explained and discussed under Section VI.\nIV.\n\u201c STEEPLE.\u201d\nOn Jan. 16, 1907 while I was haviiio\u2019 a sitting with Mrs\nPiper in the Irish Literary room at Hanover Square, Miss\nJohnson was having a synchronous sitting with Mrs Thompson\nin the larger of the S.P.K. rooms. I was told when Mrs\nThompson had gone into trance, and we then began to try to\nget messages transferred from one medium to the other. The\ncontrols of either medimr. were also asked to report what was\npassing at the other sitting. No success attended these experi-\nments. In the Piper sitting the communications went on in\nthe ordinary way\n;\nthe controls, who had been commissioned\nto give messages to Mrs Thompson\u2019s control \u201c Nelly \u201d and to\ndescribe what was passing at her seance, breaking in from\ntime to time to report progress. Thus, immediately after the\narrangement had been made with MyerSp about the triangle\nand circle experiment related in the last section, the following\nwas written :\n\u2014\nExtract from record of sitting ivith Mrs. Piper held on Jan.\n16, 1907.\n(Present: J.

Yes; quite understood.\n\fLVII.] A Series of Goncorcla\/nt Automatisms. 41\nI now give copies of various notes and letters which relate\nto this incident :\n\u2014\nNote by J. G. P. made on January 16, 1907, at 3.40 p.m.\nWith reference to an incident that occurred in a sitting with Mrs.\nPiper held on this day.\nSome days ago\u2014\na\nweek, more or less\u2014I thought 1\nreceived a letter from Miss Johnson in which she said that she\nhad discovered a cross-corres}3ondence between the scrijrt of Mrs.\nVerrall and that of Mrs. Holland : the coincidence consisting in the\nproduction of the word \u201c stee^Je \u201d by both. She added (so I\nthought) that she thought it rather clever of her to have made out\nthe coincidence, as in Mrs. Verrall\u2019s script the reference to the\nsteeple was in Latin.\nOne or two days after 1 thought I had received this letter I was\ngoing through the scripts of klrs and Miss Verrall which had been\nsent to me since the end of November 1906 ;\nand in one of Miss\nVerralFs writings I came across a drawing of two birds looking at\na thing like this v V.\nUnderneath the drawing the word \u201cdoves\u201d was written; and\nsome phrase like \u201cshe saw it over the church\u201d. I made a note,\n\u2014\nor so I believe\u2014(I will verify after completing this note) pointing-\nout that this might be a vague reference to the \u201csteeple\u201d men-\ntioned\u2014as I thought\u2014both in Mrs. Yerrall\u2019s and Mrs. Holland\u2019s\nscripts. When making this memorandum I looked for the letter in\nwliich I thought Miss Johnson had informed me of the coincidence.\n'When I failed to find it a doubt momentarily possessed me whether\nI had ever really had such a letter from Miss Johnson ;\nbut I\ndismissed this doubt as absurd.\nYesterday, Jan. 15, 1907, I was lunching with Mrs. Verrall after\na Piper sitting. I believe I then told Mrs. Verrall that kliss\nJohnson had discovered another coincidence between her script and\nMrs. Holland\u2019s, and I believe that I told her that \u201csteeple\u201d was\nthe common idea or word.\nThis morning the Myers control, or Prudeus, asked me whether\nthe word \u201c steeple \u201d had been written by Mrs. Verrall, and, I think,\nadded that he had tried to give it to Mrs. Thompson also. (My\nrecollections of what exactly was written b}^ the Myers control or\nPrudens are somewhat hazy; but I am purposely making this note\n\f42 J. G. Piddington. [part\nbefore writing out or reading through the record of this morning\u2019s\nsitting.)\nWhen \u201c\nsteeple \u201d was mentioned in the Piper trance I became\nquite enthusiastic and exclaimed \u201cExcellent\u201d; as I thought that the\nword had now been produced by a third automatist. The control\nasked me if Mrs. Verrall had got the word \u201csteeple.\u201d I replied\nthat I was not absolutely certain, but believed she had. The reserve\nmanifested in this reply was almost entirely, if not altogether, due\nto my natural caution. Not having myself seen the evidence for the\ncoincidence I did not like unreservedly to vouch for the occurrence\nof the word \u201csteeple\u201d in Mrs. Verrall\u2019s script. Possibly\u2014though\nonly possibly \u2014the doubt may have recurred to me\u2014though certainly\nI did not formulate it, if it did\u2014whether I had in reality learnt\nfrom a letter written by Miss Johnson of the occurrence of \u201csteeple\u201d\nin Mrs. Verrall\u2019s and Mrs. Holland\u2019s scripts.\nAfter the Piper sitting was over I went into Miss Johnson\u2019s\nroom, where she had been having a sitting with Mrs. Thompson.\nBefore examining Miss Johnson\u2019s notes of her sitting in order to\nsee whether there were any coincidences between the trance-utterances\nof Mrs. Thompson and the script of Mrs. Piper, I said to Miss\nJohnson :\n\u201c Well, anyhow, there was one good thing this morning,\nfor the controls said they had given the word \u201c steeple \u201d to Mrs.\nVerrall. You remember you wrote and told me that you had\ndiscovered that both Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland had been writing\nabout a steeple\u201d. Miss Johnson denied all recollection of having\nwritten any such letter, and denied the existence of an}^ such coin-\ncidence. I then dictated to Miss Johnson a short note giving the\nessential parts of this note.\nI am not a vivid dreamer and I rarely remember my dreams\n;\nbut when I do dream, my dream not infrequently takes the form of\nreceiving letters, and in my dream the handwriting of my dream-\ncorrespondent is just like that of the living person from whom I\nimagine I am hearing. I think I have once or twice before mis-\ntaken dream experiences for waking experiences.\nI have some kind of vague suspicion that I may perhaps have\ngiven \u201csteeple\u201d as a cross-correspondence message for the Piper\ncontrols to convey to Mrs. Verrall ;\nbut this can be verified by\nreference to the records. [\u201cSteeple\u201d was not chosen as a cross-\ncorrespondence message at any time.]\nI have now looked up the note relating to Miss Verrall\u2019s script\nand find that my recollection recorded above is correct.\n\fLVII.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 43\nThe note runs as follows ;\n\u2014\n\u201c Notes re C.Cs and V. scripts.\nH.

[i.e. cross-\ncorrespondence] between you and ]Mrs Holland and did I tell you\nwhat the common word or idea was 1 It may help you to remember if\nI add that to the best of my belief I told you that I fancied I had\nfound in your daughter\u2019s script a possible, though vague, reference\nto the same word or idea. Please think this over carefully, for if\nmy memory isn\u2019t playing me tricks, and if your memory corroborates\nmine, the controls will have brought off rather a pretty thing\n(Written on the back of the envelope) \u201c Did you tell H. V. [i.e. Miss\nHelen Verrall] when you returned home about my thinking that her\nscript had a reference to a C.C. obtained by you and Mrs H?\u201d\nTo this Mrs Verrall replied on Jan. 17 ;\n\u2014\nOn Monday Jan. 14 at lunch you described to me a pair of\nregardant doves in H\u2019s script and asked if I had had anything\nsimilar. You then said something about Mrs. Holland and myself\nhaving had something about a church steeple, which was and is\nquite unintelligible to me. You said that Miss Johnson had told\nyou this or you had dreamt it. I certainly never mentioned the\nepisode to Helen ;\nthe first she knew of it was when I read aloud\nthe pencil note outside your letter. (Helen corroborates)\nNote by J. C. P. re above, dated Jan. 18, 1907.\n\u201c Fow said that Miss Johnson had told you or you had dreamt it.\u2019\u2019\nI think I first said that Miss J. had told me ;\nand only added that\nperhaps I had dreamt it when Mrs. Verrall looked perplexed at\nmy I'eference to a steeple, and then probably I was speaking more\nin joke than otherwise. At the sitting on Jan. 16 when the control\n\f44 J. G. Piddimjion. [part\nasked me if Mrs. Verrall had received the word steejsle, or rather\nwhen I understood it to ask that, and when I answered that I\nthought she had received it, I had entirely forgotten the ignorance\ndisplayed and confessed by Mrs. Verrall on Jan. 14 of all knowledge\nof the occurrence of the word in her script.\nSome days or perhaps a week or two later, to tease Mrs\nPiper, I told her in fun that she needn\u2019t think mediumistic\ngifts so exceptional, as I myself, for instance, was a medium\ntoo. I was, of course, thinking of the \u201c Steeple \u201d incident, but\nI did not say anything about it, my object being to mystify\nher. And I do not see how my remark could have given any\nclue to what came out subsequently in the trance ;\nand the\nsurprise I manifested, when, on Jan. 16, Myersp said he thought\nI had given \u201c Steeple \u201d to Mrs A^errall, ought to have thrown\nher trance-consciousness off the scent. I will now relate the\nsequel.\nOn Feb. 19, 1907, the following words were spoken during\nthe waking-stage, and were certainly addi\u2019essed to me, as I alone\nwas present :\n\u2014\nGeorge Pelham [who is represented throughout as co-operating\nwith Hodgsoiip and MyerSp] is in there, shaking both hands at\nme and muttering a kind of language ;\nand they say that they tell you\nthings in your dreams some day some time.\nExtract from record of sitting until Mrs Piper held on\nMarch 13, 1907.\n(Myers communicating) I gave her [i.e. Mrs Verrall] the\nword Church as did Hodgson also.\nJ G.

That\u2019s good ;\nvery good.\nyou did not reply but your spirit seemed to grasp the\nidea, and that pleased me greatly as it seemed the nearest\napproach to making j\nou U.D. clearly that I ever (hesita-\ntion) gave, [or, \u201cgone.\u201d]\n\flvil] a Series of Goncordavt Automatisms. 45\nJ. G. P. Is it \u201c gave \u201d ?\ndid.\nJ. G. P. Yes, I understand.\nThe mention here in close proximity of \u201c Church \u201d and\n\u201c Steeple \u201d is interesting in two ways. First, because I had\nnoted a connection between the phrase in Miss Verrall\u2019s script\nof ISTov. 20, 1906, \u201cshe has seen it above the church,\u201d and the\n\u201c Steeple \u201d cross-correspondence which I had imagined had\noccurred in the scripts of Mrs Holland and Mrs Verrall\n;\nand, secondly, because as long ago as Nov. 16\u2014six weeks\nat least before my dream\u2014the following had passed at one of\nSir Oliver Lodge\u2019s sittings with Mrs Piper :\n\u2014\n(Communicator not indicated; perhaps Myers or Rector; probably\nnot Hodgson.)\nSt. Paul has been given.\nAsk Piddington if he said anytliing about a church at Mrs\nHolland\u2019s. Ask him if he srave a message to be recorded\nO O\nhere about a church\u2014if he said church to Mrs Holland.\n0. J. L. All right, I will.\nThe matter was recalled at a sitting held on Dec. 3, 1906 :\n\u2014\n(Hodgson communicating) Did you ask Piddington about the\nChurch'? He said something to me through Mrs Holland\nabout the Church.\n0. J. L. Very well, that is a C.C. [i.e. cross-correspondence] message.\nYes, have you heard about the others yet?\n0. J. L. No, but they will all be recorded and collated in due time.\nHad Sir Oliver Lodge communicated to me either of these\npassages, the genesis of my dream might have been traced to\nthem ;\nbut as a matter of fact he did not do so, as I find on\nreference to his letters. He acquainted me with most of the\nother cross-correspondence experiments in his sittings, but,\ncuriously enough, he omitted to mention this one. Nor did I\nsee the type-written records of the sittings of Nov. 16 and\nDec. 3 until after \u201c Steeple \u201d had been mentioned in the Piper\nsitting of Jan. 16, although I did see a few of the other records\nof the Edgbaston sittings before this date. It is a pity that\n\f46 J. 0. Picldington. [part\nMyersp hedged when my tone of surprise showed that I did\nnot understand his original and significant, if not entirely\nexplicit, statement: \u201cI thought you gave it at Mrs A^errall\u2019s \u201d\n;\nbut tliat is an unfortunate habit of trance-personalities. Still,\nhe seemed to retract his retractation by adding spontaneously :\n\u201c T heard it quite clearly ;\nbut you seemed so perplexed when\nI spoke it here I wondered if my hearing was good Anyhow,\nwhether he hedged or not, Myersp comes out of it, so far as\nmemory is concerned, much better than I do ;\nfor on Jan. 16 1\nhad forgotten what Mrs. Verrall had told me on Jan. 14:\nnamely, that she was unaware of the appearance of \u201c Steeple\n\u201d\nin her script.\nAs regards the references made in the sittings of Nov. 16 and\nDec. 3, 1906, to Mrs. Holland, myself and a church, it deserves\nnoting that Mrs Holland\u2019s script of Dec. 4, 1906, opens with\nthe words :\n\u201c The grey church tower.\u201d\nThey occupy a line to themselves, and seem to be quite dis-\nconnected from the rest of the script.

You did mention\nMrs Sidgwick\u2019s name, you did mention a library, and\nyou did sign the message with your name.\nI did certainly, and am very pleased to hear that she fully\nregistered the thoughts which I indubitably (1) gave her.\n\fJ. 0.

On Feb. 6, between 11.32 and\n11.37 a.m. (as near as I can calculate), MyerSp said he had\nreferred to \u201c a library matter \u201d through Mrs Verrall ;\nand on\nFeb. 1 1 that he had persistently repeated the word \u201c library\nto Mrs Verrall, also his own name and Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s ;\nand,\nto the best of iny recollection and belief, the word \u201c library\n\u201d\nwas not mentioned on any other occasion in Mrs Piper\u2019s\ntrance during the whole period of the English sittings except\nin connection with this episode.\nIt is unnecessary, I think, to emphasise further the coin-\ncidences between what was written during Mrs Piper\u2019s trances\nof Feb. 6 and 11 and in Mrs Verrall\u2019s scripts of Feb. 4\nand 6, for even to a careless reader they must be apparent.\nKegarded as answers to Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s question these concordant\nmessages are not correct, which is a puzzling circumstance if\nwe regard them as inspired by Frederic Myers. Yet it is very\ndifficult to regard them as identical guesses independently made\nby Mrs Piper and Mrs Verrall.\nNothing that passed at the Piper sittings, and nothing that\nMrs Sidgwick had said or written to Mrs Verrall (v. Mrs\nSidgwick\u2019s paper, pp. 417, 419 and 422) could, so it seems to\nme, have possibly suggested that the conversation at Terling\nwas connected with the Gurney Library or any library ;\nand\nthough neither Mrs A^errall nor Mrs Piper knew or had any\nmeans of guessing the right answer to the question, it must\nhave been obvious to both of them, whether in a normal or\nabnormal state, that the subject of the conversation at Terling\nmust have been one to which memories of an emotional kind\nwere attached. To Mrs Verrall her script of Feb. 4 seemed\nso pointless that in sending it to me she informed me that\n\f58 J. G. Fiddington. [part\nshe had not communicated it to Mrs Sidgwick (as she was\ninstructed to do by the scribe) because she could not see that\nthere was anytliing to \u201c tell\nIn Mrs Piper\u2019s trance it is clearly indicated that \u201c library\n\u201d\nis the subject of a cross-correspondence. Mrs Verrall\u2019s script\nof Feb. 4 in the phrases \u201c I will give the message elsewhere\ntoo today\u201d and \u201cWe have tried for that today. Wait for their\nanswer \u201d conveys the same meaning. Moreover, in her script\nof Feb. G is the phrase :\n\u201c There is some point in the\nLibrary. Put together the Library and the bough\u201d, \u201cthe\nbough \u201d being \u201c Apollo\u2019s bough \u201d and evidently standing for\nthe same thing as \u201c Laurel wreath \u201d. As will be seen later\n(v. pp. 94-9), \u201cLaurel wreath\u201d is a perfectly certain cross-\ncorrespondence ;\nand the point of \u201c putting together\n\u201d \u201c Library\n\u201d\nand \u201c Laurel wreath \u201d must lie in the fact of both being the\nsubject of cross-correspondences.\nI would particularly draw attention to the straightforward\nw\u2019ay in which MyerSp on Feb. 11 maintained his account of\nwhat he had written through Mrs Verrall in the face of my\ndenial that any such things had been written by her. There\nwas no hedging this time. (Of. p. 46.)\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script of Feb. 6 contains what I take to be\nan interesting illustration of the intrusion of her normal con-\nsciousness upon her automatic consciousness. I conceive that\nthe scribe was trying to refer again to the Library mentioned\nin the script of Feb. 4, and possibly trying to get the \u201c E.Gr.\nLibrary\u201d written. (The extract from the sitting of Feb. 19,\ngiven above, should be read in this connection.) Mrs Verrall\nhad, however, recently learnt that Lord Spencer was resigning\nthe Chancellorship of Manchester University ;\nand to this\npiece of supraliminal knowledge is to be traced the intro-\nduction of \u201c the Great Library has already gone before \u201d, an\nobvious allusion to the Althorp Library (now at Manchester),\nand of \u201c Hugh Le Despenser \u201d\n;\nand also of the \u201c K.G.\u201d, tliough\nperhaps the letters \u201c Iv.G.\u201d may have been a mistranslation of\nthe scribe\u2019s \u201c E.G.\u201d\nIn conclusion, I think I ought to explain how it could be\nthat I forgot the contents of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of Feb. 4\nso quickly and completely, for if these phenomena are due to\ntelepathic action between living persons it is evident that in\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Atdomatisms. 5i)\nthis case I was one person besides Mrs Verrall herself from\nwhom information about Mrs Verrall\u2019s script could have been\nextracted by Mrs Piper.\nIn the first place I made a point throughout these experi-\nments of not puzzling over Mrs and Miss Verrall\u2019s scripts. I\nread them through as they reached me, most often hurriedly\nand carelessly, endorsed on them the day and hour at which\nI received them, and then put them aside. In the second\nplace I was attending three sittings a week with Mrs Piper,\nand writing out the full record of the three sittings. It was\nessential to write these out as soon as possible after they\nwere held, and consecpiently I had little spare time. And\nin the third place I was building a house, and that occupied\nmost of my spare time and energy, and in itself was quite\nsufficient cause for driving other matters out of my head.\nI have entered into this personal explanation, because I\nwant to make it plain that if Mrs and Miss Verrall and\nMrs Piper drew their knowledge of each others\u2019 scripts from\nmy mind, at any rate it was not because my attention was\nconcentrated upon the automatic scripts of Mrs and Miss\nVerrall.\nVI.\n\u201cHOPE, STAE AND BROWNING.\u201d\nImmediately following the extract from the sitting of Feb. 11,\n1907 quoted in the last section (pp. 52-55), came these words:\n\u2014\n(Myers communicating) Did she [i.e. Mrs Verrall] receive the\nword.\nEvangelical.\nJ.

Yes, I certainly will.\nthank you very much good morning.\nM\nOn my return home after the sitting I looked through Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s script and found in her script of Jan. 28 what I\ntook to be a representation, though in expanded form, of \u201c Hope,\nStar and Browning\u201d; and the next day (sitting of Feb. 12)\nI told Myersp of the success, as already described in the last\nsection (p. 55). The word \u201cEvangelical\u201d had not appeared\nin Mrs. Verrall\u2019s script; so on Feb. 13 I said to MyerSp :\n\u2014\n\u201c Y^ou said you gave the word \u2018\nEvangelical \u2019\nto Mrs Verrall.\nWhen did you give it ? ^Yas it lately since you have talked\nwith Mrs Verrall at this light ? \u201d [i.e. since Mrs Verrall had\nhad sittings with Mrs Piper]. To this MyerSp replied :\n\u2014\u201c No\nI believe not\n;\nbut recall it as one of my own words which I\ntried to give her \u201d.\nAt the sitting of Feb. 27 \u201cEvangelical\u201d is again, and this\ntime spontaneously, referred to by MyerSp, first as \u201c evangelic \u201d,\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 61\na second time apparently as \u201c evangelical \u201d, a third time, in\ncapital letters traced with care and mnch apparent effort, as\n\u201cEVE E V L \u201d, and finally as \u201c E V E L Y \u201d\n;\nand as these last\nletters are written MyerSp adds :\n\u2014\u201c I am too today, my\nthoughts wander\u201d. (\u201cWeak\u201d, or some such word, should be\nsupplied to fill the gap between \u201c too \u201d and \u201c today \u201d.)\nThen on March 6 George Pelham, who is represented as\nan active co-operator with Myers and Hodgson, says that among\nother things Myers had given \u201c Evelyn EvELYN Hope \u201d to\nMrs Verrall. Whereupon the following conversation took place\nbetween George Pelham and myself :\n\u2014\nJ. G. P. Is that the explanation of the word which came out here as\n\u201c Evangelical \u201d ?\nyes.\nJ. G. P. I begin to see. Thank you.\nit was very stupid of Rector I must say as Hodgson and\nMyers both kept Repeating it over and over again, to\nhim.\nIt will, I think, be allowed that the modification of \u201c Evan-\ngelical \u201d into \u201c Evelyn Hope \u201d was spontaneous and not trace-\nable to any suggestion from me. Indeed I could not have\ngiven such a suggestion, as, beyond the fact that \u201c Evelyn\nHope \u201d brought in the word \u201c hope \u201d again, it conveyed at the\ntime no more meaning to me than the word \u201c evangelical \u201d\n;\nand, moreover, I did not then know that it was the title of\none of Browning\u2019s poems.\nI will now quote the scripts of Mrs Verrall which I take\nto correspond with the words \u201cHope, Star and Browning\u201d:\n\u2014\nScript of Jem. 23, 1907.\nJustice holds the scales.\nThat gives the words but an anagram would be better\nTell him that\u2014rats star tars and so on.

Some\nauthorities also trace repa? and acrWip to the same root ; so\nnot only do these two words form an anagram, but they are\nrelated etymologically, and in significance are closely associated.\nBut this is not the only reference to \u201cstar\u201d in Airs A^errall\u2019s\nscript, for the word occurs again, this time in English, in\nthe script of Jan. 23, which indisputably forms a prelude\nto the script of Jan. 28 ;\nand here, too, it appears as part of\nan anagram, \u201c rats arts star \u201d.\nI suspect that the introduction of the quotation from Blake\n\u2014\n\u201c And mocked [for \u201c mocks \u201d] my loss of liberty\n\u201d\n\u2014was due to\nthe preceding epw? which means both \u2018\nlove \u2019\nand the \u2018 god of\nlove \u2019\n;\nfor in Blake\u2019s poem it is the \u2018\nPrince of Love \u2019\nwho\nmocks at the lover\u2019s loss of liberty.\nWhen, by reason of the coincidences involved, my mind\nbegan to concentrate itself on these two pieces of script and\nthe words \u201c Hope, Star and Browning \u201d given in the Piper\ntrance, a vague impression came over me that the string of\nwords, \u201c rats arts star,\u201d had somehow and somewhere come\nunder my eyes before.

On August 23, 1907 Mr James sent me the\nsheet of paper containing a rough draft of anagrams in the\nhandwriting of Dr Hodgson of which a copy is reproduced here.\nI confess that when this came into my hands I felt as I\nsuppose people do who have seen a ghost ;\nfor, though not\nsurprised to see the \u201c rats arts star \u201d anagram, I was positively\nstartled when I saw the anagram \u201c rates stare tears aster \u201d etc.,\nof which I had no recollection whatever.^\n^It maj' seem strange that, while the appearance of \u201crats star tars\u201d in\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script brought back to my mind the fact of my having seen\nthese words on a sheet of paper in Dr Hodgson\u2019s, handwriting, the appearance\nof \u201ctears stare\u201d and \u201caster\u201d in the same script should not have provoked\nthe smallest glimmer of memory of my having seen this anagram too among\nDr Hodgson\u2019s papers. I believe that I can account for my remembering in\none case and for my not remembering (I purposely do not say \u201cforgetting\u201d)\nin the other. When I was going through Dr Hodgson\u2019s papers I found\nscattered about all over the place, in books, in pigeon-holes of his writing-\ndesk, among notes on the Piper trance, among bundles of old letters, and so\non, scores of sheets, or more usually scraps of paper scribbled over with\nwords and figures. I didn\u2019t at first grasp what they were, and threw many\nof them away into the waste-paper basket. Then after a time I realised that\nthey were notes of riddles and puzzles, charades and anagrams and acrostics ;\nand thinking they might possibly come in useful either to corroborate\nreferences which might be made to them in the Piper trance by the Hodgson\ncontrol, or as material on which to base questions which could be put at\nsome future time to this control, I kept thein and made a packet of them. I\nsoon found, however, that many of the scraps referred to the same puzzle or\nanagram, as the case might be. \u201cStar, rats, tars, arts\u201d appeared again and\nagain on separate scraps of paper. Dr Hodgson had evidently whiled away\nmany an idle quarter of an hour over this anagram. Thinking it would be\nuseless to keep duplicates I destroyed them, and kept only one example of\neach. These, as I have said, I handed over to Mr Dorr and Mr Henry\nJames before I left Boston, after explaining how I thought they might come\nin useful. (They w^ere left with the executors, not because they as executors\nwanted them, but simply because it was in Boston and not iii England that\nthey could at that time be utilised.)\nXow the sheet of paper w'hich Mr Henry James sent over in August 1907\nin response to my enquiry is not the piece of paper which I remembered as\nhaving seen wdth the words \u201crats arts star\u201d on it.

Darwin, and one of\nwhich Helen reminded me (made by Mr Myers) :\n\u2018\nnotes Eton\u2019s\nonset; tones &c.\u2019\u201d\n\u201c Star \u201d would doubtless be a word very likely to suggest\nitself for the purpose of an anagram. The anagram \u201c Eats,\narts, star \u201d, for instance, has lately, so I am informed, been\nmade use of at Maskelyne and Devant\u2019s conjuring entertain-\nment. That the anagram \u201c Eats star tars \u201d should have appeared\nin Mrs Verrall\u2019s script is in itself not, of course, in the very\nsmallest degree surprising. The significance of its appearance\nlies partly in its coincidence with the \u201c Star \u201d of Mrs\nPiper\u2019s trance ;\npartly in the fact that the \u201c star \u201d of the trance\nand the \u201c star \u201d of the script were both associated with \u201c Brown-\ning \u201d\n;\npartly, as will be seen presently, in its identity with\nan anagram automatically written by Miss Verrall, which was\nlikewdse associated with Browning ;\nand partly in the fact\nthat both it and another anagram, \u201c stare tares tears \u201d, with\nwhich it was conjoined, had been similarly conjoined by Dr\nHodgson.\nBut the coincidence does not end here.\nWe naturally were all considerably elated by the \u201c Hope\nStar and Browning \u201d correspondence (though the full significance\nsheet which contains this anagram among others. The words \u201cstar tars rats\u201d\nwould have cauglit my eye, I should then have seen that there were other\nwords on the same sheet, and that would have been enough to decide me to\nkeep this sheet and to destroy the other scraps on which \u201crats arts star\u201d\nappeared alone. Not having the very least interest in such things\u2014in fact\nanagrams and acrostics have always seemed to me to be a particularly silly\nthing to waste time and energy over\u2014I should not have bothered to read the\nother words on the sheet. This, then, will explain how it was that the\nappearance of \u201ctears stare\u201d and \u201caster\u201d in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script awoke no\nrecollection in my mind, as did \u201crats arts star\u201d. I must apologise for this\ndigression, but I do not see how I could well omit it if I am to furnish\nstudents of these phenomena with the evidence requisite for forming an\nopinion as to the possible sources of the automatic writings.\n\fLVII.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 67\nof the incident was not apparent till months later), and by\nway of encouragement Mrs Verrall, on Feb. 15, gave her\ndaughter a general description of the incident, being, however,\ncareful to substitute imaginary words for the original ones.\nFor \u201cStar\u201d \u201cPlanet Mars\u201d was substituted, for \u201c Flope\n\u201d\n\u201cVirtue,\u201d and for \u201cBrowning\u201d \u201cKeats.\u201d The script of Jan.\n23 was not mentioned, and a general description only of the\nscript of Jan. 28 was given. One correct detail only was\nMiss Verrall told, and that was that a five letter anagram had\nconstituted a part of the success on Jan. 28.\nBefore, however. Miss Verrall had been told anything at all,\nshe had on Feb. 3, written the following script: \u2014\nVulliamy not to be confused with the other.\nWilliams more precious than rubies what was\nthe name of the younger child Cecil Atl Mundellier\n(scribbles)\nquam ob rem in Siciliis proficiscitur [wherefore in Sicily he\nsets out.]\na green jerkin and hose and doublet where the\nsong birds pipe their tune in the early morning\ntherapeutikos ek exotikoii [a healer from aliens]\na monogram\nthe crescent moon\nremember that and the star\nlike a thunder riven oak the grim remains\nstand on the level desolation of the plains\na record of all ages of the span\nwhich nature gives to the weak labour of a man.\n\f68 \u2022\/. G. Piddington. [part\nAfter she had been told about the coincidence between her\nmother\u2019s script and that of Mrs Piper, Miss Verrall wrote the\nfollowing on Feb. 17, at which time she was away from home\nand at a distance from Mrs Verrall :\n\u2014\nandrosace (?)

Possibly there exists another, though\nless definite, link between them. The second script unques-\ntionably alludes to Browning\u2019s Pied Piiyer of Hamelin in the\nphrase \u201c rats everywhere in Hamelin town \u201d. This phrase is\nfollowed by the words \u201c now do you understand ? \u201d, which seem\n\flvil] a Series of Concordant Automatisms. 69\nto imply that after a previous failure success has now been\nachieved in impressing the automatist with the idea of the\nPied Piper. Traces of this previous failure may perhaps be\nfound in the first script in the word \u201c pipe \u201d\n;\nand also in the\nphrase \u201c therapeutikos ek exotikon \u201d, which is applicable to\nthe Pied Piper, for he cured Hamelin of its plague of rats,\nand, says the poem, \u201c There was no guessing his kith and\nkin\u201d. Moreover, the only script which Miss Verrall wrote\nbetween Feb. 3 and Feb. 17, that of Feb. 12, opens with\nthe disconnected phrase :\n\u201c Manheim she has seen it \u201d\n;\nand\nManheim, the name of one German city, represents, I suspect,\nthe first attempt to express the name of another German city,\nHamelin.\nOther points to be noted in connection with these two\nscripts of Miss Verrall\u2019s are as follows :\n\u2014\n(1) The resemblance between Miss Verrall\u2019s drawing of a\nstar followed by the words \u201c that was the sign \u201d, \u201c she [i.e.\nMrs. Verrall] will understand when she sees it \u201d, \u201c and a star\nabove it all \u201d on the one hand, and Mrs Verrall\u2019s \u201c Aster\nTepa<s\n\u201d\n(Star Sign) on the other.\n(2) The appearance of a four letter anagram. (It might\nhave been supposed, after Miss Verrall had been informed of\nthe significance of a five letter anagram in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script\nof Jan. 28, that, if she were going to produce an anagram at\nall, the number of the letters in it would have been five.)\n(3) That this four letter anagram introduces the English\nword \u201c star,\u201d the equivalent of one of the two words of Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s five letter anagram, aster repa? ;\nand that it is the\nsame anagram as one of the anagrams in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script\nof Jan. 23, of which Miss Verrall knew nothing.\n(4) The introduction of three words of Dr Hodgson\u2019s anagram,\nnamely, rats, arts and star ;\nand of two of Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nanagram, rats and star.\n(5) The absence of \u201ctars\u201d which had appeared in Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s script of Jan. 23.\n(6) The appearance of \u201carts\u201d which had not been given in\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script, but which is found on the sheet of paper\non which Dr. Hodo;son had worked out his anagrams.\n(7) The fact that Dr Hodgson had failed to hit on one\nobvious rearrangement of the four letters a t r s, namely \u201c Tsar,\u201d\n\f70 J. G. Piddington. [part\nand that \u201cTsar\u201d does not occur in either Mrs or Miss Verrall\u2019s\nwriting.\n(8) The ingenious manner in which two birds are killed with\none stone in the phrase \u201c rats everywhere in Hainelin town\nBy the two birds I mean \u201c Browning \u201d and an anagram of\n\u201c Star \u201d, namely \u201c rats \u201d.\n(9) The use of the feminine plural Traerwr ;\nwhich, though\nperhaps suggested by the origin of the word ^lairaa-wv and by\nthe immediately preceding \u201cdiapason\u201d, was nevertheless appro-\npriate if we take \u201c the rhythm through all \u201d to be a recondite\nallusion to the concordant results achieved by the three\nautomatists, Mrs Piper, Mrs Verrall and Miss Verrall.^\n(10) For reasons explained above it seems not improbable\nthat the script of Feb. 3 is to be connected with that of Feb.\n17 ;\nand if it be so connected, a further coincidence is to be\ntraced between it and the script of Mrs Verrall. It will be\nremembered that Mrs Verrall was inclined to regard her script\nof Jan. 28 as aiming at the expression of the idea of a bird\n(v. p. 63). Miss Verrall\u2019s script of Feb. 3 ends with a drawing\nof a bird followed by the word \u201cbird\u201d.\nThere are other points of great interest connected with\n\u201c Hope Star and Browning \u201d and those scripts of Mrs and Miss\nVerrall which I have been discussing; but I can deal in detail\nhere only with three more: namely, (1) the tj^uestion of how far\nMyersp succeeded in indicating the particular piece of script to\nwhich the \u201ctriangle within a circle\u201d had been attached; (2) the\nappropriateness of the appending of the triangle and circle to\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script of Jan. 28 ;\nand (3) the conjunction in\nIMiss Verrall\u2019s script of Feb. 3 of a crescent moon with a star.\nThe other points must be left for discussion until I come to\ndeal with an experiment of which the object was to see if\nMyerSp could understand a message conveyed in Latin and\nreply intelligently to it (v. \u201cThe Latin Message,\u201d pp. 312-416).\n(I) How far did MyerSp succeed in indicating the piece of\nscript to loliicli the triangle and circle had been attached.\nOn Jan. 16 I had asked Myersp to mark corresponding\nmessages given to Mrs Verrall and Mrs Holland with a triangle\n^For another point connected with \u201cdiapason\u201d v. pp. 329-330.\n\fLVII.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 71\ninside a circle. Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of Jan. 28, which con-\ntained a cross-corresponding message, was so marked.\nOn Feb. 26 I asked Hodgsoiip to tell MyerSp that Mrs\nVerrall had drawn a triangle within a circle, and he promised\nto convey my message. Apparently however he failed to do\nso, for on March 6 the following occurred in the course of the\nsitting with Mrs Piper :\n\u2014\n(Myers communicating) I gave also [i.e. to Mrs Verrall] a\n(a circle was here drawn)\n(Rector communicating)\nhe holds up a circle.\nR.\nJ.

On March 13 it is, I think, with sufficient explicitness\nconnected with \u201c Hope, Star and Browning \u201d : the words, as I\ntake it, used by MyerSp to indicate l\\Irs Yerrall\u2019s script of\nJan. 28.

G. P. I see what you mean.\nThe last extract will, I think, be clear if I explain that on\nFeb. 27 MyerSp said quite distinctly that \u201cHope, Star and\nBrowning \u201d was his answer to the Latin message. At this\npoint it does not matter in the least whether there was any\nsense in this answer or not ;\nall that we need consider now\nis this ;\n\u2014MyerSp connects the Latin Message with a poem of\nBrowning\u2019s ;\nhe then connects this poem with \u201c Browning-\nHope Star\u201d; I had as long ago as Feb. 11, before there was\nany suggestion made that \u201c Browning, Hope, Star \u201d was an\nanswer to the Latin Message, recognised Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of\nJan. 28 as answering to these thi-ee words; MyerSp connects\nhis drawing of the circle with his reference to the Browning-\npoem ;\nand as a matter of fact, as we know, a circle with a\ntriangle inside it was drawn at the end of Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript of Jan 28. The process by which MyerSp indicates\nthe particular piece of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script in which the circle\nand triangle appeared is no doubt involved and difficult to set\nforth in any but a round-about and tiresomely recapitulatory\nfashion ;\nbut I think that, notwithstanding the complexities, 1\nam justified in considering that a right answer was conveyed,\nand that it was not derived from any hints given by myself.\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 75\n(II) The airpropriateness of affixing the triangle and circle to\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script of Jan. 28.\nThe script of Jan. 28 contains the words:\n\u201c On the earth the broken sounds\nthreads\nIn the sky the perfect arc\n\u201d\nand they are clearly misquotations of the last line of the\nninth stanza of Aht Vogler ;\n\u201c On the earth the broken arcs ;\nin the heaven, a perfect\nround.\u201d\nThe \u201c broken arcs \u201d and the \u201c perfect round \u201d of the poem\nare, moreover, clearly alluded to in the drawing of the triangle\nwithin a circle which comes at the end of the script of\nJan. 28 : the segment joined by the chord AB representing\nthe broken arcs \u201d, and the circle representing the \u201c perfect\nround \u201d.\nI think that the appropriateness will be admitted, as also the\npertinence of the words written by Myersp on March 13: \u201cIt\n[i.e. the Latin Message] suggested a poem to my mind. Hence\nBrowning, Hope, Star etc. It reminded me of a passage very\nfamiliar to me when I was in the body and I mentioned\nCircle as being a connecting link \u201d.\nI do not know if AM Vogler w\u2019as \u201cvery familiar\u201d to Frederic\nIMyers,^ but certainly the whole poem expresses with singular\nfidelity the aspirations of his whole life and the convictions\nof his last years.\n(III) The conjunction in Miss Vcrrall\u2019s script of Feh. 3 of a\nCrescent moon and a Star.\nOn April 8 Myersp again states that the Latin Message\nsuggested the poem of Browning\u2019s to him, and he goes on\n:\nI made a circle\nE. M. S. Oh ! a circle. Yes, 1 remember.\n1 Since this was written, my attention has been drawn to a letter of Myers\u2019s\npublished in the Life and Letters of Sir R. C. Jebb (pp. 144-5), from which\nit is clear that Myers was familiar with Abt Voijler.\n\f76 J. G. Piddington.

Mrs\nVerrall may have been intended by these words, and on\nApril 8 many cross-correspondence messages were mentioned\nby MyerSp as having been given to her ;\nbut the expression\n\u201c the other light \u201d is unusual ;\nI believe it is applied only\nonce elsewhere ^\nto Mrs Verrall, who is otherwise referred\n^ This was on March 6, 1907 when George Pelham spoke of Mrs Verrall as\n\u201cthe other light'\u2019, but only after I myself had applied the phrase to her: my\nreason for so doing being that George Pelham is represented\u2014naturally and\nappropriately\u2014as being unfamiliar with Mrs Verrall\u2019s name.\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 77\nto, when cross-correspondences are in question, as \u201cMrs Verrall,\u201d\n\u201cMrs V,\u201d, or \u201cMrs V\u2014\u201d, or merely as \u201cshe\u201d or \u201cher\u201d. It\nremains, then, uncertain who is meant by \u201c the other light \u201d.\nIt should, however, be noted that MyerSp begins by saying\nthat he \u201c made a circle \u201d. Now it had already been clearly\nstated that the circle had been drawn through Mrs Verrall.\nHe next adds :\n\u201c I then drew ... a star through the other\nlight \u201d ;\nand \u201c then \u201d suggests a different occasion, and \u201c other \u201d a\ndifferent automatist.\nThe drawing over the crescent moon is certainly intended\nfor a star, as the words, \u201c and a star \u201d, immediately follow the\ndrawing of the crescent moon ;\nand anyhow in Miss Verrall\u2019s\nscript of Teb. 17 there is an unmistakable drawing of a\nstar.

Mrs Verrall always took the\ndrawing for arrows, and made a note to that effect in her\nscript-book on Feb. 28 ;\nand spoke of them to me as arrows\non March 13, a fact which I made a note of at the time. It\nwas not till June 4, 1907 that Mrs Verrall learnt that \u201carrow\u201d\nhad been a cross-correspondence experiment.\nThe phrase \u201c tria convergentia in unum \u201d, written opposite\nthe drawing, suggests that the subject of the drawing is con-\nnected with a cross-correspondence. A similar phrase \u201c tria\nilia in unum convergentia \u201d had occurred in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript of Jan. 20, 1905, and the words \u201cyou have surely had\nthat before \u201d showed that the scribe knew that.\nOn Feb. 18 Eector had written: \u201cHodgson .says do not\nforget arrow, watch for it if it comes out \u201d.\nMrs Piper\u2019s trance did not begin on this day until 11.20 a.m.;\nand it must have been quite 11.30 before these words were\nwritten.\nMrs Verrall sat down to write automatically on Feb. 18\nat 10.55 a.m. and would certainly have completed her script\nby 11.30.

All that\nI did notice was the possible resemblance of tlie drawing\nof the pointed arch to an arrow-head.\nIf the reader will now turn to page 68 and look at Miss\nVerrall\u2019s script of Feb. 17 (which I saw for the first time at\n10.55 a.m. on Feb. 19), he will find it contains an un-\nmistakable drawin\" of an arrow.\nO\nMiss Verrall\u2019s drawiim of an arrow came later than Mrs\nYerrall\u2019s and than the first announcement of the word in the\nPiper trance ;\nand the case thus falls into line with the order\nof emergence of the cross-correspondence which is conveniently\nsummed up in the words \u201c Hope, Star and Browning \u201d\n;\nand\nalso one of the conditions connected with Miss Verrall\u2019s part\nin that cross-correspondence is reproduced, in that the drawing\nof the arrow is contained in a piece of script written wlien\nl\\Iiss Verrall was away from her home and at a distance\nfrom her mother (v. p. 68).\nAgainst the drawing of the arrow in Miss Verrall\u2019s script\nof Feb. 17 are set the words \u201cmany together\u201d; which imply,\nthat \u201carrows\u201d rather than \u201carrow\u201d is meant, and put one in\nmind of Mrs Verrall\u2019s three arrows.\n.\nTo sum up then: Mrs Verrall draws an arrow on Feb. 11,\nHodgsoiip on Feb. 12 says he has given \u201carrow\u201d to Mrs\nVerrall, and on Feb. 17 Miss Verrall draws an arrow.

It is quite\nunnecessary to quote any of these references verbatim ;\nit will\nbe sufficient to summarise the more important.\nOn March 12, 13, and 18 it was stated that Mrs Verrall\nhad written D \u2014 the first letter of \u201cDwarf\u201d; on March 19\nHodgsoiip asked if Mrs Verrall wrote \u201cD W \u201d, and added\nthat he thought she had also written a \u201c G \u201d : i.e. the first\nletter of \u201cGiant\u201d; and on March 20 he said that D W K\nand F had been written. Statements continued to be made to\nthe effect that one or more letters of \u201c Dwarf\u201d had been\nwritten by Mrs Verrall. But with the one exception just\nmentioned, where Hodgsoiip said that he thought the letter\nG had been written, no claim was at any time made\nthat Mrs Verrall had written \u201c Giant \u201d or any part of the\nword.\nOn May 1 Myersp said that Mrs Verrall did not seem\nto understand \u201cDwarf\u201d yet; but finally on May 27 said: \u201cI\ndid give Dwarf\u201d.\nI had always regarded this experiment as one of the com-\nplete failures, as I could find nothing in i\\Irs AVrrall\u2019s script\nwhich directly or indirectly seemed to allude either to a Dwarf\nor a Giant.\nMrs Verrall did not know of the attempts to make her\nwrite \u201cGiant and Dwarf\u201d until October 1907, when I told\nher that these words had been the subject of a long-continued\ncross-correspondence experiment, without, however, informing\nher of the date on which the experiment had been started.\nAirs Verrall then made a search through her script but\nfailed, as I had done, to discover in it any possible trace\neither of the words or of the idea \u201cGiant and Dwarf\u201d.\nOn Jan. 19, 1908 Mr Hereward Carrington wrote from\nAmerica to Airs Verrall as follows :\n\u2014\nI had two sittings with Mrs Piper lately\u2014in both of which R.

I looked back on hearing this claim repeated, and I find\nthat on Feb. 19, 1907, the script suggested \u201clittle men\u201d. The\npoem beginning \u201c Up the airy mountain \u201d and referring to \u201c owl\u2019s\nfeather\u201d is about \u201clittle men\u201d.

The parenthetic\nmention of \u201c Owl\u2019s feather \u201d was, I conjecture, indirectly due to\nthe experiment started a few hours earlier at the sitting with\nMl'S Piper.\nThus, on Feb. 19 about 11.20 a.in.

Twice, then, before the script of Feb. 19 was\nbegun at 5.5 p.m. we may suppose that an attempt was\nmade to make Mrs Verrall write \u201cGiant and Dwarf\u201d.

He managed to get a feather drawn and the word\n\u201c feather \u201d written. The word \u201c feather \u201d suddenly provoked in\nthe automatist, whose subconsciousness had some hours earlier\ntelepathically received the \u201cDwarf\u201d message, an association of\nideas between \u201cDwarf\u201d and a poem containing references to\n\u201c little men \u201d \u201c wee folk\n\u201d \u201c up the airy mountain \u201d and \u201c owl\u2019s\nfeather \u2019\u2019.\nThe scribe at once recognised that an alien train\nof thought had been aroused ;\n\u201c no, that is owl\u2019s feather ;\nnot\nwhat I want\u201d: and then succeeded in leading the automatist\nback to the original subject.\nTo put it in another way : I do not believe the drawing and\nthe writing of \u201cfeather\u201d would under ordinary circumstances\nhave evoked recollection of \u201c Up the airy mountain \u201d or \u201c owl\u2019s\nfeather \u201d, had it not been that the automatist\u2019s consciousness had\npreviously been impressed with \u201cDwarf\u201d.\nThe coincidence may seem slight ;\nbut the following points\nshould be taken into consideration :\n\u2014\n(1) The script of Feb. 19 was written within 6 hours of\nthe \u201cGiant and Dwarf\u201d experiment being arranged at the\nsitting with Mrs Piper.\n(2) \u201cUp the airy mountain\u201d and \u201cowl\u2019s feather\u201d can be\ntaken to allude to \u201c Dwarf \u201d only, and not to \u201c Giant \u201d. When\nat the sitting of March 11 the subject of the \u201cGiant and\nDwarf\u201d experiment was mentioned for the first time since it\nwas arranged on Feb. 19, and since Mrs Verrali\u2019s script of\nFeb. 19 was written, MyerSp showed that he had understood\nthe word \u201cDwarf\u201d, but was uncertain of the word \u201cGiant\u201d.\nMoreover, except when Hodgsoup once said he thought Mrs\nVerrall had written the G. of \u201cGiant\u201d, the trance-personalities\nnever claimed to have succeeded iir making her write \u201c Giant\n\u201d\nor any letters of the word ;\nwhereas they often claimed to\nhave nrade her write \u201cDwarf\u201d or some letter or letters of it;\nand seven months later at a sitting in America Hodgsoup still\n\fJ.

[part\nperhaps no more than that\nCorona laureata [laurel crown] has some meaning here\nAVith laureate wreath his brow serene was crowned.\nNo more today\u2014await the better news\nthat brings assurance with a laurel crown.\nNeither the word \u201cLaurel\u201d nor the word \u201cWreath\u201d occurs\nelsewhere in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script during the period under\nreview.\nThe script opens with the word \u201c Laura\/\u2019 which, in view of\nwhat follows, may almost without hesitation be taken to be the\nfirst emergence of \u201cLaurel\u201d. If \u201cLaura\u201d is the first attempt at\n\u201c Laurel \u201d, \u201cand another\u201d may mean that another word, \u201cwreath \u201d,\nis to be added to it. I cannot trace any meaning in the words\n\u201c There is some great obstruction \u201d\u2014\u201c under a bushel \u201d. The\nreference to the Library has been dealt with already (v. pp. 57-8).\nThen begins a series of phrases which all (except \u201c a jewelled\ndagger three curved objects and a point \u201d, which may possibly be\nthe first emergence of the three arrows drawn on Feb. 11, v.\np. 81) centre round the idea of laurel, and lead up to the final\nexpression \u201c laurel wreath \u201d or \u201c laurel crown \u201d.\nThe word \u201c laurel \u201d is repeated no less than four times, and\nonce in large letters ;\nand further emphasis is thrown by the\nLatin words \u201c Laureatus\n\u201d \u201c Corona laureata \u201d, and by the drawing\nof a laurel wreath. The idea of a wreath of laurel is introduced\nunder slightly different forms six times: (1) \u201cLaureatus\u201d, i.e.\ncrowned or wreathed with laurel; (2) \u201ca laurel wreath\u201d; (3) a\ndrawing of a laurel wreath ; (4) \u201c Corona laureata \u201d, a crown or\nwreath of laurel ; (5) \u201c laureate wreath \u201d\n; (6)\n\u201c a laurel crown \u201d.\nWe shall meet with similar examples of this harping on one\nword or idea later on (v. pp. 178, 202, and 223).\nIn view of the frequent use of classical phraseology in Mrs.\nYerrall\u2019s script, and of its employment in this particular script, it\nis tempting to see in the first word of the script, \u201cLaura\u201d, an\n\flvil] a Series of Concordant Automat isms. 99\nattempt at \u201c laurea \u201d, which is good Latin for a laurel wreath or\ncrown, rather than at \u201c laurel \u201d\n;\nbut the name Laura is said to\nsignify \u201c Laurel \u201d, and this perhaps affords the simplest ex-\nplanation. The concluding words of the script seem to suggest\nthat success has not yet been attained, but is to be looked for in\nthe future ;\nwhich makes excellent sense, since the script of Feb. 6,\nhad no significance until the complementary phrase was pro-\nnounced at the sitting of Feb. 26. I think it quite possible that\nthe word uttered by Mrs. Piper, which in the original record\nI represented by \u201c Morehead (?) \u201d, was really \u201c laureate \u201d, indis-\ntinctly pronounced as \u201c Lauread \u201d.\nAn interesting parallel to the last three lines of Mrs. Verrall\u2019s\nscript is to be found in Miss Verrall\u2019s script of March 17, which\nreads thus :\n\u2014\nAlexander\u2019s tomb quinque et viginti aunos post urbem conditam\n[five and twenty years after the founding of the city.]\nwith fire and sword to purge the altar not\nwithout grief laurel leaves are emblem\nlaurel for the victor\u2019s brow\nSay not the struggle nought availeth\nSesame and lilies arum lilies\nWhen the darkness on the quiet land\nScarlet tulips all in a row.\nThis is the only occurrence of the word \u201c Laurel \u201d in Miss\nVerrall\u2019s script during the period under review.\n1 suspect that this script exhibits some curious associations of\nideas. I should attempt to trace its development thus\n:\nAlexander is the first emergence of the idea of a victor, and of\na victor who was the recipient of many crowns- of victory. This\nis succeeded by a fresh topic :\n\u201c with fire and sword to purge\nthe altar not without grief\u201d. These words perhaps show some\nsupernormally acquired knowledge of a paper just written by\nDr. Verrall but not as yet seen by Miss Verrall. Between\n\u201cgrief\u201d and \u201claurel\u201d there is a space, which usually indicates\na change of subject not only in Miss Verrall\u2019s but also in Mrs.\nVerrall\u2019s and Mrs. Holland\u2019s script. The earlier mention of\nthe victor Alexander has cleared the way for the emergence of\n\u201c laurel leaves \u201d and \u201c laurel for the victor\u2019s brow \u201d\n;\nand between\nthese words and the succeeding cj^uotation from Clough there is\n\f100 J. G. Piddington. [part\na natural enouoh association of ideas. Miss Verrall\u2019s automatic\nwriting is so often characterised by odd and out-of-the-way\nclassical allusions that I make bold to suggest that there may\nhave been another link between \u201c Alexander \u201d and \u201c laurel\nleaves The Greek name for laurel is Sd<pm}, and Sd(pvt]\n'AXe^uvSpela means butcher\u2019s broom. That, as a matter of fact,\nthis plant got its name not from Alexander the Great but from\nAlexander (Paris) the son of Priam, makes the association of\nideas a little less straightforward, but not, I think, more unlikely.\nTo complete the account of this correspondence between the\nscripts of Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Piper an interesting prelude\nand sequel to what has been related above ought not to be\nomitted ;\nfor, though they do not manifest so high a degree of\ningenuity as is exemplified in some other instances and especi-\nally in the auro? oupavo? a.KV]awv incident (v. pp. 107-172), they\nat least afibrd a good illustration of the intelligent way in which,\nin my opinion, the cross-correspondences were worked.\nExtract from record of sittinq loifh Mrs. Finer held on\nJan. 2, 1907.\n(J.

Before Myers\u2019s\ndeath the only veridical messages obtained by Mrs Verrall\nor at her house had been by means of table-tilting. Mrs\nVerrall writes\n:\nI do not think that at this point MyerSp was thinking definitely\nof the means or method [of communication] but onlj' of the fact\nthat Mr. Myers and I had agreed in the belief that Planchette or\nTable-tilting might convey verifiable evidential matter Mr\nMyers and I had discussed that very question constantly in the\nlast days before he left England.\nThe statements of MyerSp do not necessarily imply that\nthe \u201c two messages \u2019\u2019\nwhich he claimed to have given Mrs\nVerrall were given through Planchette. They can bear a\nmeaning consistent with the facts mentioned in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nletter, and might be paraphrased thus :\n\u201c You remember that\nyou believed in the possibility of veridical messages being\nobtained by means of some form or other of motor-automatism.\nWell, I will now remind you of two messages which I have\nmade you record automatically.\u201d\nIt is the second message only\n\u2014\u201c Celestial Halcyon days \u201d\n\u2014\nwhich I intend to discuss.\nAt the sitting of Jan. 15 Mrs Verrall did not recognise\nthat any such phrase as \u201c Celestial Halcyon days \u201d had occurred\nin her script ;\nthe \u201c yes \u201d which she spoke after the words\n\u201cHave you it? and do you recall it?\u201d being an assent to \u201cHave\nyou it?\u201d and not to the second question. On Jan. 22, how-\never, she wrote in the train, while on her way to a sitting\nwith Mrs Piper, a long piece of rimed script which ended\nthus :\n\u2014\nThen in the broader lioht\nO\nThat floods the world s u p e r n\nClear to the sharpened sight\nHold fast the One Eterne !\n\f10(3 J. G. Piddington. [PAliT\nIt was obvious to Mrs Verrall that the whole point of\ntliese preposterous lines was the introduction of the word\nsupern \u201d, and this, as she noted at the time in the book in\nwhich she copies her script, she mentioned on Jan. 23 to\nher daughter and niece. Later on that day, Jan. 23; she\nremembered that the word \u201c supernal \u201d had occurred in her\nscript of July 3, 1903 (quoted in Proc. Vol. XX. p. 64)\nwhich ran as follows :\n\u2014\nFor her a message of peace \u2014contemplation on high summits\n\u2014stillness in the air. -pos oeSa? dewi' [to the threshold of the\ngods] noctivaga ilia \u00a3 Eelene [the night-wandering moon (reading,\nEe\/Viyi'\/;)] dp\/xttTt apyvpoeiTL \u2014eAei <Tv S\u2019 ovk kirivola y^piupkinj [on her\nsilvery car goes.

The main point of the script, however,\nseems to be that while halcyon days in this world are tran-\nsitory, in the celestial world they are unending. The idea of,\nthough not the actual phrase, \u201c celestial halcyon days \u201d would\nappear, then, as MyerSp claimed, to be found in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript, and Mrs Verrall acknowledged this at the sitting of\nJan. 30.\nIt should be noted that the discovery in the script of a\npassage answering to \u201c celestial halcyon days \u201d might not have\nbeen made but for the clue afforded by the script of Jan. 22.\nAirs Piper had read parts of Proc. Vol. XX, and may\ntherefore have read the script of July 3, 1903, which is\nquoted in it as an example of an attempt at the production\nof Greek hexameter verse ;\nbut even if this was the case, it\nis difficult to imagine that any part of the consciousness of\n\f107\nLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nMrs Piper, who is entirely without classical scholarship, should\nhave summarised it in the words \u201c celestial halcyon days.\u201d But\nthe importance of this incident lies chiefly in the fact that\nthe mention in the trance by Myersp of \u201c celestial halcyon\ndays \u201d was one of the principal factors that determined Mrs\nA^errall\u2019s choice of the subject of a test-cpiestion which she\nput to MyerSp on Jan. 29.

[part\nChoice of a Test- Question.\nIn the early part of 1907, after six sittings with Mrs Piper\nin which Mrs Verrall had been struck with the vraisemUance\nof the Myers personality, and also with the knowledge shown\nof unpublished portions of her script connected with that\npersonality, Mrs Verrall decided to ask at her next sitting a\nquestion which it would be reasonable to suppose that Myersp\n\u2014\nif this personality really had access to the memories of Frederic\nMyers\u2014would be able to answer. For this purpose certain\nconditions seemed desirable, some arising from the circum-\nstances of the particular experiment, and others suggested by\ngeneral considerations derived from previous experience. The\nimportant conditions were\n:\n1. the question should be unintelligible to Mrs Piper herself,\nin order to prevent the medium\u2019s own knowledge from affecting\nthe result\n;\n2. the question should be short, on account of the difficulty\nand slowness of communication between sitter and communicator\nin the present conditions of the I\u2019iper trance\n;\n3. the question should concern a subject which had not only\nbeen known to, but which had been thoroughly familiar to\nFrederic Myers, so that, had it been addressed to him in his\nlifetime, he would have answered it instinctively, without a\nmoment\u2019s doubt, hesitation or reflection. It should therefore\nconcern a matter not merely of intellectual acquisition or learn-\ning, but of knowledge so completely assimilated as to have\nbeen a stable part of his personality\n;\n4. the answer should be complex, though not necessarily\nlengthy ;\nand in order to avoid the risk of an accidentally\nsuccessful guess on the part of Mrs Piper, it should not be\nexpressible in a single word or phrase, but should require for\ncompleteness allusions to more than one group of associations\n;\n5. the answer should be such as could be proved to have\nbeen known to Myers : that is, the verification should not\ndepend on Mrs Verrall\u2019s personal knowledge or impression\nbut on unmistakable external evidence\n;\n6. the question and answer should, in fact though not in\nappearance, be connected with a range of subjects already\nalluded to in Mrs Verrall\u2019s own script by Myersy.\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 109\nIt was not easy to find an appropriate question. Some of\nthe required conditions would be met if Greek were the language\nof the question ;\nand it seemed desirable, with a view to condi-\ntion 5, to frame a question based on a Greek quotation to\nwhich reference had actually been made in some published\nwork of Myers\u2019s, though condition 1 demanded that this\nreference should not be obvious or easily discoverable.\nIt was on January 22, 1907 that Mrs Verrall decided\nto apply this test, if only she could think of a satisfactory\nquestion. On the evening of January 23 it suddenly\noccurred to her tliat the words kui ui\/to? oiiparo? ukvijlwv would\nserve the purpose. The words may be translated \u201c and the\nvery Heaven waveless\u201d. They come from the 5th book of\nthe Enneades of the Neo-platonic philosopher Plotinus, and\nform part of a passage in which he recites the conditions that\nshould precede and accompany the attainment of ecstasy, or\ncommunion of the individual soul with the divine : these con-\nditions being perfect calm of soul and body and of external\nnature as well. A translation of the passage from Plotinus\nwill be found in the second volume of Human Personality,\np. 291, but the Greek words are not given, and in the trans-\nlation no emphasis is laid on the particular phrase in question.\nIt is there rendered \u201c calm be the earth, the sea, the air, and\nlet Heaven itself be still \u201d, and this sentence is in the middle\nof a paragraph of some eleven lines.\nThe four words in Greek (followed by the name of the author,\nPlotinus, but by no further reference) occur once in Myers\u2019s\npublished works, namely, as the motto to a poem on Tennyson\npublished in Fragments of Prose and Poetry (p. 117). They\nare not there translated.^\n' Wishing to know whether Fragments of Prose and Poetry was known to\nMrs Piper I wrote, about the end of July 1907, and put her the question,\nwithout explaining my reason for doing so. She replied on August 10 as\nfollows: \u2014 \u201cI am sorry to say that according to my best knowledge and recol-\nlection I had never even heard of such a book as you mention and did not\nknow that such a one had ever been printed. Since receiving your letter,\nhowever, I have enquired of Professor James, Miss Robbins and a Miss Willis,\na friend of Miss Edmunds [formerly assistant secretary of the American Branch\nof the S.P.R.] and a member of the S.P.

G. Piddington. [PAKT\nFurther the words may be said to have some connexion\nwith Mrs Verrall\u2019s own script. On January 15, Mrs Verrall\nbeing the sitter, MyerSp claimed to have referred in Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s script to \u201cCelestial Halcyon Days\u2019\" (see Appendix\na and Section X.). This claim Mrs Verrall neither accepted\nnor denied, though, at the time, she felt sure that she\nhad written no such phrase. Her own script, however, on\nJanuary 22 recalled to her mind a much earlier script, that\nof July 3, 1903,^ which on consideration was seen to reflect\nthe ideas, though not the phraseology of \u201c Celestial Halcyon\nDays\u201d. The phrase of Plotinus, therefore, though not occur-\nring in Mrs AVrraH\u2019s script, belonged to a range of ideas\nclaimed by MyerSp as thex\u2019e occurring. To put it briefly,\nan intelligence acquainted with Plotinus could see a connexion\nbetween the words cwto^ ovpapo? aKVfxwv and \u201c Celestial\nHalcyon Days \u201d\n;\nbut there is no similarity in the actual\nphraseology to suggest a conne.xion to an intelligence, however\nacute, not possessed of certain definite classical, philosoirhical,\nand literary associations.\nThe words then seemed to fulfil the desired conditions.\nshows such a book is not easy to obtain Mr James thought there\nwere only a few private copies in America, and that it had never been sold\nin the shops \u201d\nMiss Robbins\u2019s letter to Mrs Piper states that she had heard of the book\nbut never seen it.\nOn receipt of Mrs Piper\u2019s letter I wrote for further information to Professor\nWilliam James, who on Oct. 19 replied as follows: \u2014\u201cI enclose you a letter\nfrom Longmans about the sales of Myers\u2019s Frarpnents in Boston. W. B. Clarke,\nwho is more likely to have handled the book than any other Boston book-\nseller, tells me, through his foreman, that he should guess he may have sold\na dozen copies.\u201d\nThe letter from Messrs Longmans\u2019 New York house was as follows ; \u2014\u201c In\nre \u201cFragments\u201d. We regret to say we are unable to reply to your question\nvery satisfactorily : we do not keep any records of individual sales to localities,\nand it is difficult to say where books go in detail especially as we cannot trace\nsales through the jobbing houses. But a search through our own books for\n.3 months after publication shower! direct sales to Boston booksellers of only\n25 copies. We do not recall any recent demands, and indeed the total sales\nhave been very disappointing in view of the considerable den.aud shown for\nthe large book (Human Personality).\u201d\nFor my own part I entirely and unhesitatingly accept Mrs Piper's statement\nthat she had not heard of the book.

Ill\nThey could be shewn to have been familiar to Frederic Myers,\nthey suggested more than one group of associations and could\nbe connected with Mrs Verrall\u2019s previous script, and at the\nsame time they would have no meaning for Mrs Piper.\nOn January 23 Mrs Verrall decided to apply this test,\nif an opportunity arose, and on January 24 she noted this\nintention and the reasons for the choice of words in her\ndiary (see Appendix \/3). No one was informed of her intention,\nand no mention was made of the subject till she put the\nquestion to MyerSp, in the presence of J. 0. P., during the\nsitting of Jan. 29 : that is to say, at the first sitting which\nshe attended after she had devised this experiment and cliosen\nthe words of Plotinus as the subject of it.\nThe Test-Question put.\nOn -lanuary 29, 1907 Mrs Verrall at the end of her\nsitting with Mrs Piper suggested as an experiment to MyerSp,\nthat if she spoke three Greek words he should say of what\nthey reminded him, or translate them into English ; she also\nsaid that these words, or something like them, had been\nsuggested by her script, and then gave the three words in\nGreek, avrog oupavog aK-vfxoop, omitting kui (and), (see Ap-\npendix y.)\nIn the event of a complete answer being given, Mrs Verrall\ntherefore expected\n:\n1. a translation into English of the words avrog ovpavog\naKVfxoov ;\n2. a reference to Myers\u2019s poem on Tennyson ;\n3. a reference to Plotinus and the latter ]iart of Human\nPersonality.\nPossible Fiust Attempts in Mrs Piper\u2019s Trance to Eeply\nTO the Test- Question.\nOn January 30, the day after the question was put, Mrs\nVerrall had another sitting with Mrs Piper. There was no\ndirect reference to the test-question, but Mrs Verrall thought\nthat some of the phrases used in the trance, though only\n\f112 J. G. Picldington. [part\ndisconnectedly introduced, showed that the associations for which\nshe had asked were present in the tlionghts of the com-\nmunicating intelligence ;\nthat there was in fact what might\nbe called \u201c preliminary emergence \u201d of them. Thus the phrase\n\u201c haven of rest \u201d was mentioned as likely to recall to Mrs\nA^errall a memory of Myers ;\nand towards the end of the\nsitting there was a disconnected allusion to \u201c Larches \u201d and\n\u201c Laburnum \u201d (see Appendix S). Both these words have\nTennysonian associations for Mrs Verrall; the spring budding\nof the larch and the first flowering of the laburnum always\nbringing to her mind Tennyson\u2019s descriptive phrases\u2014both from\nIn Memoriam\u2014\u201c When rosy plumelets tuft the larch \u201d and\n\u201c Laburnums, dropping-wells of fire\nIn view of what has been said above about \u201c Celestial\nHalcyon Days \u201d it is perhaps not without significance that the\nverse of which the first line is \u201c where rosy plumelets tuft\nthe larch \u201d speaks in its fourth and last line of \u201c the sea-blue\nbird of March \u201d, i.e. the king-fisher or halcyon ;\nand also in view\nof future developments to be described later (v. pp. 117-122)\nthat this verse forms part of In Memoriam, xci, wherein the*\npoet invokes his dead friend to appear to him in visible form.\nMrs Verrall said nothing about these impressions of hers\neither at the sitting or in her written comments on the record\nof it which she sent to J. G. P. They were, however, noted\nby her in her diary on February 2.\nAllusions in Mrs Verrall\u2019s Script to the Test-Q,uestion.\nWe now come to the consideration of definite references to\nthe subject of the test-question in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script and\nin Mrs Piper\u2019s trance. AA^e begin, following chronological order,\nwith those in Airs A^errall\u2019s script, and consider first the\nstatements of her script, and next her interpretation of those\nstatements.\nThere were, as might have been expected, allusions in her\nscript, during the months of February and Alarch, to subjects\n1 In the same way the first leafage of the elm ami the first singing of the\nthrush recall to her Browning\u2019s: \u201cThat the lowest boughs and the brushwood\nsheaf Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf\u201d, and his \u201cwise thrush\u201d.\n\fLVII.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 113\nassociated more or less definitely in her mind with the three\nGreek words.

Why will you\nnot put the signature 1 Surely you know now that it is\nnot you. FWHM.\nThe allusion to Tennyson\u2019s Mortc d'Arthur was recognised\nby Mrs Verrall and seemed not inappropriate. Indeed, the\nassociation in her mind of the two topics, Plotinus\u2019s waveless\ncalm and Tennyson\u2019s poetry, may well have been responsible for\nthe appearance of the \u201c valley of Avilion where blows not\nany wind\u201d.^\nAgain, on Feb. 25, the script, which opened with an\nindication that a cross-correspondence was intended (cf. p. 270),\nwent on to refer to another passage in Tennyson suggestive\nof a heavenly calm :\n\u2014\nI stretch my hand across the vapourous space the interlunar\nspace\u2014twixt moon and earth\u2014where the Gods of Lucretius\ncpmft' their nectar.

This led her to re-read\nIn MemorianG on or about February 2 6. Again, on the morning\nof February 26 IMrs Verrall learnt that in her daughter\u2019s\nscript\u2019 of February 25 there had been a quotation from\nBrowning\u2019s Asolando. These two facts are mentioned in view\nof what followed in Mrs Yerrall\u2019s script.\nOn February 20 the script had its first definite statement\nabout avTo? ovpaioi aKv\/uLcov as follows :\n\u2014\navTus otSpai'os dKVjiMv. I think I have made him [probably\n\u201cRector\u201d] understand but the best reference to it will\nbe made elsewhere, not Mrs Piper at all.

At any rate so clear was the\nimplication to Mrs Amrrall that it suggested to her the idea\nthat there might be a definite passage in Tennyson about\nspiritual communion under such conditions.\nAt the time the script was produced Mrs AMrrall took \u201c the\nseer who kneiv \u201d to mean Tennyson ;\nshe also interpreted\n\u201c after the earthquake and the fire \u201d etc., as an allusion to the\ncommunion of Moses with God on Alount Sinai ;\nthough, as\na matter of fact, the allusion is certainly to the appearance\nof God to Elijah on Horeb. The significance of the real\nallusion and the possible significance of the automatist\u2019s mis-\ninterpretation of it will be explained later. (See pp. 124-5).\nOn March 6 the script, written at 10.45 a.m., was more\nexplicit :\n\u2014\nI have tried to tell him of the calm the heavenly and\nearthly calm but I do not think it is clear.

Then by means of a textual quotation\n:\n\u201c And in my heart, if calm at all, If any calm, a calm\ndespair \u201d : reference was made to the \u2018\ncalm of despair \u2019\nof an\nearly section of In Mcmoriam (xi), with the comment that\nthat was not the final thought of the poem. To say that the\n\u2018\ncalm of despair \u2019\nof In Mcmoriam was not the final thought\nis to imply that in the poem is another calm, not of despair,\nwhich is the final thought.\nFinally, on March 11, Mrs Verrall\u2019s script combined allu-\nsions to Plato and Tennyson with phrases about \u201c unseen or\nlialfseen companionship \u201d, \u201c voiceless communing and unseen\nPresence felt \u201d in such a way as to suggest that both Plato\nand Tennyson were aware of supersensuoirs modes of com-\nmunication. The language of this script is reminiscent of the\nlast stanza of F. W. H.

In\nfive instances it clearly means one of the group of spirit collaborators who are\nengaged in influencing the automatist\u2019s writing ;\nand in one of these five\ninstances it seems to point to Rector as the particular collaborator. In two\ninstances it might apply either to Rector or to J. G. P. ;\nonce only does it\nseem certainly to refer to J. G. P., and twice it refers to an indefinite person,\nwho is neither a communicating spirit nor J. G. P.\nThe words \u201cI have tried to tell him of the calm\u201d etc. might mean: \u201cI,\nMyers, have tried to tell J. G. P. through Mrs Piper \u201d ;\nbut more probably\nthey are intended to mean: \u201cI, Myers, have tried to tell Rector of the calm\netc. in order that he may express my message clearly through Mrs Piper \u201d.\nThrice at least, if not oftener, it is stated that Myersp caught Rector between\ntwo trances and gave him a word to be repeated through Mrs Piper: \u201c Abt\nVogler\u201d in one instance (sitting of April \u201824), \u201cHomer\u2019s Iliad\u201d (sitting of\nApril .30) and \u201cPlotinus\u201d (sitting of May 6). I imagine that attention was\nthus drawn to this particular modus operandi in order to indicate that when\nsome specially important or difficult word has to be conveyed to Rector for\nreproduction in Mrs Piper\u2019s script it is easier to convey it at some time other\nthan that during which Rector is actually engaged as amanuensis.\nNote hy J.

Her knowledge of In Memormm dated\nback many years to the days of her girlhood, when she was\nwholly ignorant of Greek. Though exceedingly familiar with\nthe poem itself she had made no detailed study of it, had\nread no commentary on it, nor had she ever read any Life of\nTennyson.^ But now on re-reading In Memoriam in the light\nof the suggestions thrown out by her script, she was at once\nstruck with the resemblance in language as well as in thought\nbetween the stanzas (sections xciv\u2014v) which describe the\npoet\u2019s trance and its antecedent conditions and the passage in\nthe fifth book of the Enncadcs where Plotinus lays down the\nantecedent conditions desirable for ecstasy\u2014the passage namely\n^ In the Memoir of Tennyson by his son is a letter addressed to the author\nby Myers, which opens thus : \u2014\n\u2022\n\u201cYou have asked me, knowing well what pleasure the request would give\nme, to send you a few words, not of formal criticism, but of expression of\nintimate feeling as to your father's work ;\n\u2014your father, a greater man than\nwhom I have never looked and shall never look upon. You tell me to\napproach the subject, \u2018\nnot from the side of Plotinus, but from the side of\nVirgil.\u2019 I understand what you mean. On your father\u2019s prophetic message,\nas I must deem it, I have already said my say ;\nand the other point at which\nmy sympathy was deepest was iu our common veneration for Virgil.\u201d\nMrs Verrall came across this letter, as noted in her diary, on May 18,\n1907, when she for the first time read the Memoir of Tennyson by Hallam,\nLord Tennyson.\nThe letter suggests that Tennyson may have talked with Myers about the\ninfluence of Plotinus on his thought and writings.\nSince writing the above I came across a footnote to a passage in Myers\u2019s\nModern Poets and Cosmic Law (p. 168) which states that the line taken in\nhis essay Tennyson as Prophet\u2014in which stress is laid on the affinity between\nTennyson and Plotinus\u2014was based iu part upon Tennyson\u2019s own conversation.\nNote by J.

But, so far as\nI am aware, no one has noticed the close resemblance between\nthe conditions which accompany the trance of the poet in In\nMernoriam and those which are prescribed by Plotinus for the\nproduction of trance or ecstacy\u2014a resemblance which appears\nto be more than accidental.\nIn the fifth book of the Enneades (v, i, 2, 3, 4) Plotinus\ndemands certain antecedent conditions for the soul that would\nfind communion with the Great Soul. Before contemplation\nof the Great Soul, the individual soul must be freed from\ndeception and every kind of beguilement and be in a state\nof peace. But not only must its own mental and bodily\nsurroundings be peaceful ;\nthe surrounding external world must\nalso be at peace. \u2018The earth must be calm, the sea calm,\nand the air, and the very heaven itself without a wave.\u2019 ^\n- Reading with Kirchhoff aKij\/xiov. There is some disagreement as to the exact\ntext of this passage, but none as to its meaning.\n\flvil] a Series of Concordant Automatisms. 119\nThe trance of In Mcmoriarn and its preceding conditions are\ndescribed in sections xc\u2014xcv, which, as Mr Bradley ^ points\nout, form \u2018\na group of closely connected sections on the present\ncommunion or contact of the living and the dead. It opens\nwith the expression of desire for such communion, and closes\nwith the description of an experience in which this desire\nseems to be fulfilled.\u2019 The poet after calling on his friend\nto come back (xc), to come back in visible form (xci), rejects\nthe wish upon refiexion (xcii), but desires a direct contact of\nsoul and soul (xciii). Then in the next section (xciv), he\ndemands that the spirit desiring communion with the dead be\nin a state of internal calm, and in the opening of section xcv\nhe lays emphasis on the external calm of the evening and\nnight as appropriate precedent conditions of trance.\nThus, in xciv, he writes\n:\nIn vain shalt thou, or any, call\nThe spirits from their golden day,\nExcept, like them, thou too canst say,\nMy spirit is at peace with all.\nThey haunt the silence of the breast.\nImaginations calm and fair.\nThe memory like a cloudless air,\nThe conscience as a sea at rest\n:\nand again, in xcv, he speaks of\n:\ncalm that let the tapers burn\nUnwavering: not a cricket chirr\u2019d:\nO\nThe brook alone far-off was heard,\nand in his own note ^ on this passage Tennyson says :\n\u2018\nIt\nwas a marvellously still night, and I asked my brother\nCharles to listen to the brook, which we had never heard so\nfar-off before.\u2019 ^\n' A Commentary on Tennyson\u2019s In Memoriam, by A.

The\nquestion hardly admits of a certain answer without evidence,\nwhich I have not found, as to Tennyson\u2019s reading. But the\nfollowing considerations perhaps suggest that the resemblance\nis not accidental and that the writings of Plotinus were not\nunknown to Tennyson and were consciously or unconsciously\nrecalled to his memory when he was describing his own similar\nexperience.\n1. There is a certain resemblance between the phraseology\nof the above quoted passages from In Memoriam and the\nlanguage of Plotinus. The \u2018\nHash \u2019\nand the \u2018\nspirits\u2019 golden\nday \u2019\nare paralleled in Plotinus ^\nwho speaks of \u2018\nthe illuminating\nentry (eia-iovcrar kuI eia-Xd\/u\u2014ovcrav) of the soul \u2019\nbringing a\n\u2018 golden vision \u2019 (ypucroei^j\/ o\\L-(r) and again of the \u2018\neffulgence\n\u2019\n(7r\u20acplXaiui.\\lnp) surrounding the contemplative soul. The word\n\u2018\n.(Bonian\n\u2019\n^ recurs several times in Plotinus ;\nin his trance he\nsees that Time is an image of Eternity, \u2018\nthe real ^Eon,\u2019 and\nthat its three divisions are one,\u00ae there being no past, no future,\nonly \u2018\nthat which is \u2019\n(d orrw? aicor, ov fuiueiTaL yporo? . . . kui\nTO ecTTLV ael, kqi oi\/Safxov to jmeXXor ... ouSe to TrapeX>]XvOo?).\nThe calm of earth and heaven desired by Plotinus is directly\nexpressed in section xcv of In Memoriam ;\nthe calm of air and\nsea appears indirectly in the images of section xciv :\n\u2018\nThe\nmemory like a cloudless aAr, the conscience as the sea. at\nrest.\u2019\n2. The passage of Plotinus describing the required ante-\ncedent conditions of ecstasy is unmistakably paraphrased by S.\nAugustine in a famous chapter of the Confessions,^ a work with\nwhich it is believed that other passages of In Memoriam show\nan acquaintance.^ But there are phrases in In Memoriam and\nnot in S. Augustine which resemble the phraseology of Plotinus,\nand which must therefore have been derived, if derived at all,\n^ Enn., V, i, 2-6. -See In Mem,, xcv, above quoted.\n\u00ae See also In Mem., xxvi, stanza 3, and Mr Bradley\u2019s note thereon.\n* Confess., IX, 10: \u2018Si cui sileat tumnltus carnis, sileant pliantasiae terrae\net aquarum et aeris, sileant et poll, et ipsa sibi anima sileat, ... attingimus\naeternam Sapientiam super omnia manentem.\u2019\n\u00ae See In Mem., i, 1 ;\niv, 1 ;\nviii, 3; xxvi, 3; Ixx.xv, 16; and illustrative\nquotations in Mr Bradley\u2019s Commentary on those passages.\n\f122 J.

Augustine has any direct connexion with\nthese sections of hi Mcmoriam, though it may have helped to\nrecall the original passage of Plotinus.\n3. It is known that Arthur Plallam was a student of\nphilosophy and the volume of his Eemains in Verse and Prose\ncontains passages showing familiarity with the doctrines not\nonly of Plato but of the Xeo-Platonists.\u2019- That the account\nof the ecstasy of Plotinus was known to him in the words of\nthe author is proved by the appearance in his Essay on Cicero\n\"\nof an allusion in the original Greek to the experience of\nPlotinus. \u2018\nThe (puya ,uovov Trpo? \/aorop preached by the later\nPlatonists was not possible for him.\u2019 Plotinus is the \u2018\nlater\nPlatonist \u2019\nwho preaches \u2018\nthe Flight of the One to the One.\u2019\nThe Enncadcs of Plotinus ends with the description, revealed\nto him in ecstasy, of \u2018\nthe life of gods and of godlike and\nblessed men, a release from every earthly thought, a life un-\ntouched by earthly pleasure, the Flight of the One to the\nOne.\u2019\n\u00ae\nBut whether or not we suppose a direct connexion between\nPlotinus and Tennyson, it seems probable from the description\nin Pn Mcmoriam, sections xciv and xcv, that some importance\nwas attached by Tennyson to calm as a condition of trance,\nand this sentiment is perhaps further reflected in the phrase\nof section cxxii \u2018\nin placid awe,\u2019 which seems to refer to the\nearlier experience. This phrase, which has caused difficulty to\n.some critics, is certainly more appropriate if the adjective is no\nmere descriptive epithet, and if placidity is regarded by\nTennyson, as it was by Plotinus, as an essential condition of\necstasy.\nMargaret de G. Verrall.\nThe discovery of this close parallelism between Pn Memoriam\nand the passage from Plotinus seemed to Mrs Verrall both\nintere.sting in itself, and also explanatory of the choice of the\nwords avTos ovparoi dKOjo-ow by Myers as a motto to his poem\n\u2019^Remains, pp. 160, 165, 174.\n^Enn., VI, ix, 11.\n-Remains, p. 165.\n\fLVII.] 123\nA Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nou Tennyson. This poem alludes to Tennyson\u2019s desire for\npeace at death as expressed in Crossing the Bar:\n\u201c Once more he rises ;\nlulled and still,\nHushed to his tune the tideways roll ;\nThese waveless heights of evening thrill\n^Vith voyage of the summoned Soul.\u201d\n{Fragments of Prose and Poetry, p. 117.)\nHitherto Mrs Verrall had seen in the motto from Plotinus\nonly an allusion to Tennyson\u2019s own desire that there migdit be\nno moaning at the bar when he put out to sea, and to its\nfulfilment at the time of his death.^ But a much deeper\nsignificance attaches to the choice of the motto, when it is\nrecognised that Tennyson himself, like Plotinus, desired con-\nditions of external peace before attaining in life the trance\ncondition, in which he felt as though he had communion\nwith the unseen world.\nIt thus appears that after the test-question had been put to\nMyersp a series of communications by Myersy furnished a new\nand cogent explanation of Avhy Frederic Myers had associated\nthe words aurd? ovparo? uKujuuor with Tennyson. No such\nexplanation had ever before consciously occurred to Mrs Verrall.\nShe knew, of course, that the words of Plotinus had been\nassociated by Myers with Tenny^son because they formed the\nmotto of his poem on Tennyson ;\nand she supposed that he\nhad chosen them for this purpose simply because the lines in\nTennyson\u2019s Crossing the Bar:\n\u201cAnd may there be no moaning of the bar.\nWhen I put out to sea.\nBut such a tide as moving seems asleep.\nToo strong for sound and foam.\nWhen that which drew from out the boundless deep\nTurns again home.\u201d\nhad reminded him of Plotinus\u2019s calm of earth and sea and air\nand Heaven which favours communion with the Great Soul.\n^ See contemporary accounts in newspapers, which were the source of Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s know'ledge of the atmospheric conditions at the time of Tennyson's\ndeath.\n\f124 [part\nJ. G, Picldmgton.\nThat such was one reason for the association is made\nperfectly clear by the poem itself. But neither in the ])oem\nitself nor elsewhere in his writings is there a hint that Myers\nassociated the passage of Plotinus with Tennyson because of\nthe connection between it and sections xciv and xcv of In\nMemoriam.\nOn March 12 Mrs Yerrall made a detailed entry in her\ndiary recording her discovery of the ])arallelism between\nsections xciv and xcv of In Memoriam and the passage\nfrom Plotinus, and her belief that this parallelism explained\nwhy Myers had associated kul avTog ovpavM ukvixwv with\nTennyson (see Appendix On March 13 she brought a\nsummary of this entry in her diary with detailed explanations\nand references to London, and on her arrival at 20 Hanover\nSquare handed it in a closed envelope to Miss Johnson for\ntransmission to J. G. P. before she had any knowledge whether\nany attempt, other than that of January 30, had been made\nby the Pi|)er trance-personalities to answer her test-question.\nOne small point remains which needs explanation. Mrs\nVerrall, it will be remembered, took the last lines of her\nscript of Feb. 26 to be an allusion to Moses\u2019 communion with\nGod on Sinai. This inter|)retation she arrived at before she\nhad begun to suspect that there was any connexion between\navTo? oilpard? uKvp-wv and In Memoriam. Alter she discovered\nthe connexion she considered this supposed allusion to be the\nfirst emergence in her script of In Memoriam, her reason being\nthat the last lines of section xcvi of that poem run thus :\n\u2014\n\u201c And Power was in him in the night,\nMTiich makes the darkness and the light.\nAnd dwells not in the light alone.\nBut in the darkness and the cloud.\nAs over Sinai\u2019s peaks of old,\nM'hile Israel made their gods of gold,\nAltho\u2019 the trumpet blew so loud.\u201d\nNow, as already stated, the allusion in the script must be\nto Elijah ^ on Horeb, not to Moses on Sinai, for on Sinai there\n1 It is, perhaps, not without significance that \u201c Elijah \u201d was announced by\nthe trance-personalities during the sitting of May 7 as the subject of a\ncross-correspondence experiment with Mrs Holland.\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 125\nwas neither wind nor stillness : on the contrary, \u201c Moses spake\nand God answered\u201d \u201cwhen the voice of the trumpet sounded\nlong, and waxed louder and louder\nStrangely enough neither at the time nor at any subsequent\ntime did Mrs Vei\u2019rall recognise that the allusion in her script\nwas to Elijah. Her failure to do so is all the more curious\nbecause Elijah\u2019s communing with God is an apt illustration of\nintercourse with the unseen occurring when nature is at peace,\nwhereas the case of Moses is in that respect inapt ;\nand, more-\nover, the Epilogue of Human Personality, which she read\ncarefully about the end of April 1907, contains the c^uotation\n(Vol. II. p. 276) \u201cAfter the tempest a still small voice\u201d.\nCan her misinterpretation be accounted for ?\nPerhaps it may be in some such fashion as this\n:\nThe scribe on Feb. 26 was endeavouring to convey to the\nautomatist two distinct though allied ideas: (1) Elijah\u2019s com-\nmunion with God in the calm that followed upon the \u201cgreat\nand strong wind\u201d and the earthquake and the fire; (2) Moses\u2019\ncommunion with God on Mount Sinai ;\nthe first as an illus-\ntration of communion with the Divine during external calm,\nthe second as an illusti\u2019ation of communion with the Divine\nand also as an indirect reference to In Memoriam. The first\nidea got expressed in the script, the second failed to gain\nwritten expression but reached the automatist\u2019s consciousness.\nMrs Verrall would not under ordinary circumstances have con-\nfused the two incidents, but her normal mind was influenced\nby her subconscious mind (which had received and perhaps\ngrasped the importance of the second impression) and so mis-\ntook the recorded for the unrecorded impression : a mistake\nthe more easily committed because of the analogy between\nthe two.\nFirst Definite Answers to the Test-Question in\nMrs Piper\u2019s Trance.\nWe return now to the other side of the matter.\nThe references to the subject of the test-C[uestion in Mrs\nPiper\u2019s trance were as follows :\n\u2014\nOn Feb. 6 J. G. P. read to the trance-personalities a letter\n\f126 J. G. PidcUvgton. [part\nfrom Mrs Verrall, in which, after saying that it seemed to her\nthat on January 30 there was evidence of an understanding on\nthe part of Myersp of her question, she asked for a clearer\nstatement of wliat the Greek words recalled to him. (See\nAppendix ;\/.)\nOn March 6 Mj'ersp in the course of announcing various\ncross-cori'espondences which he claimed to have transmitted to\nMrs Verrall gave without explanation three words :\n\u201c Cloudless\nSkv\nHorizon\n\u201d\nfollowed the phrase: \u201ca cloudless sky beyond the horizon\u201d.\n(See Appendix 6.) In the waking-stage Mrs Piper uttered the\nwords: \u201cmoaning at the bar when I put out to sea\u201d. A little\nlater she pronounced the name \u201cArthur Hallam \u201d\nC then almost\ndirectly said it again: \u201c Arthur Hallam. Good-bye. Margaret\u201d,\nMargaret being Mi's Verrall\u2019s Christian name. (For the use of\n\u201cMargaret\u201d to indicate a cross-cori\u2019espondence with Mrs Verrall\ncf. pp. 218 and 27S, and Proc. Part LY. p. 313.) Finally she\nspoke this unfinished sentence: \u201cThere was some man Arthur\nHallam. Myers says it was he\u2014he about\u201d. (See Appendix \u00a3.)\nThough no claim was made to have given a translation of\nthe words of the test question in the phrase \u201c cloudless sky\nbeyond the horizon\u201d it would be very difficult to suppose that\nchance had furnished so satisfactory a para])hrase as this of\nacTO? ovpavo? aKu\/uucp ;\nbut ])receded as the phrase was by\nreferences to Mrs Verrall and followed by tlie quotation trom\nCrossing the Bar and the name \u201cArthur Hallam\u201d, it is prac-\ntically impos-sible to attribute its appropriateness to chance.\nMoreover, this para])hrase seems to indicate knowledge not only\nof the meaning of the three words of the test-question but also\nof their original context.

J. G. P. then asked what the drawing\nrepresented, and in reply the word \u201cBAPt\u201d was written in\ncapital letters. Myersp at once added: \u201cI thought she might\nget a glimpse of my understanding of her Greek \u201d : a remark\nwhich to J. G. P. in his foolishness seemed utter nonsense.\nEven the explanation of the drawing as a \u201cBar\u201d failed to\nremind J. G. P. of the quotation from Crossing the Bar in\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script of Feb. 2G ;\nso from him the trance-per-\nsonalities received neither hint nor encouragement on this\npoint.\nLater in the sitting J. G. P. read aloud an extract from a\nletter of Mrs Verrall\u2019s written on iMarch 12, in which she .said\nthat since her last sitting Avith i\\lrs Piper on Jan. 3U she had\nlearnt from her own script the reason why af-b? ovparo? dhcupon'\nhad had certain associations for IMyei's ;\nthat she had before\nknown the associations but not the reason for them;^ and that\nshe understood the allusion to larches and laburnum. hio\nfurther indications as to Mrs Yerrall\u2019s interpretations were\ngiven either to the entranced Mrs Piper, or to J. G. P., who\nwas absolutely in the dark and received no enlightenment\nwhatever from Mrs Verrall\u2019s letter. (See Appendix k.)\nUp to this time J. G. P. had not seen Mrs Terrall\u2019s script\nof March 11 (Appendix e) with its combination of Plato,\nTennyson and, Myers, or her notes as to the connection\nbetAveen the trance-conditions of Plotinus and Tennyson. He\nhad, it is true, seen the script of Feb. 26 (v. p. 114) Avith\nits reference to Crossing the Bar, and the script of March 6\n1 That is, she knew the associations with Plotinus and that Myers had\nused Plotinus\u2019s words as a motto for his poem on Tennyson ;\nbut she did not\nknow or suspect why he had so used them until her script showed her the\nconnection between them and In Memoriain xciv and xcv.\n\f1*28 [part\nJ.

G. P., in\nreply to a question asked by Myersp, admitted that Mrs Verrall\nhad written \u201c may there be no moaning at the bar \u201d, though\nshe had not drawn a bar. Myersp then immediately reminded\n^ Whatever the source of the knowledge displayed in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance\nconcerning the meaning of and the associations connected with ai\u2019ros ovpavoi\naKVjxwv may have been, it was certainly not my mind. I knew, of course,\nwhat Kal and avrds and oi\u2019pavos meant as individual words, but I did not know\nwhat a.Kvp.wv meant : a lack of knowledge which would not have been surprising\nin the case of a far better Greek scholar than myself, as the wmrd is a rare\none. I have never read any Plotinus ; I did not remember, though I must\nonce have know'll, that the second volume of Human Personality contained a\ntranslated extract from the Enneades of Plotinus ; and I did not know that\nthe Greek words of Mrs Verrall's test-question formed the motto of Myei\u2019s\u2019s\npoem on Tennyson. I possess no copy of Fragments of Prose and Poetry, and\nthough I believe I may once or twice have had the S.P. R. Library copy of the\nbook in my hands and glanced at a few jiages of the prose, I had not read any\nof the poems for the good and sufficient reason that, though an admirer of\nMyers\u2019s prose-style, I fail to appreciate him as a poet. I had, moreover,\npiurposely refrained from attempting to make out or guess at the meaning of\nthe Greek words of Mrs Verrall\u2019s question. When the words \u201cCloudless\nsky beyond the horizon\u201d were written in the Piper trance, I guessed that they\nwere a translation or paraphrase of auros ovpavbi a.Kvp.wu, and I surmised tliat\nit aKup-wr could really bear the sense of \u201ccloudless\u201d it must be a metaphorical\nsense, and that the original significance must be \u201cwithout W'aves \u201d. I verified\nmy guess a few hours after the sitting by consulting a Liddell and Scott,\nwhich, however, gave me no clue to the author of the words of the test-\nquestion, as the reference to Plotinus was not given in the edition which I\nused, nor is it, I believe, in any edition. Neither the reference to \u201cLarches\u201d\nand \u201cLaburnum\u201d in the trance, nor that in Mrs Verrall\u2019s letter read at the\nsitting of March 13, conveyed any hint to my mind. I have read In Memoriam\noften, and am familiar with the two different passages in which these words\noccur, but the two words as conjoined in the trance did not remind me of\neither of these passages. As stated above, I had seen Mrs Verrall\u2019s script\nof Feb. '26, but, if I thought about it at all, I certainly never connected the\ncpiotation from Crossing the Bar with ai)ros oi'paubs aKvpoiv. I had seen the script\nof March 0, but it never entered my head that the latter half of it had anything\nto do with Mrs Verrall\u2019s test-question, and, I repeat once more, I did not\nrealise that it contained a quotation from In 2Iernoriam.\nTo suppose that subconsciously I grasped the real significance and connection\nof these oracular scripts and passed my knowledge on to Mrs Piper is too\nstrained a hypothesis for me to have any patience with. If the knowledge\nshown in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance was obtained from any living person, it was from\nMrs Verrall. Note by J. G. P.\n\fA Series of Concordant Automatisms. 120\nLvri.]\nJ. G.

If,\nthen, the references to Crossing the Bar and Arthur Hallam\nin the trance of March G are to be attributed to telepathy\nfrom IMrs Verrall, one must assume either that Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nsubconsciousness had worked out the connection between In\nMemoriam and calrd? ovpavog uKi'pcov some five or six days\nbefore she normally grasped it\u2014a pei'fectly reasonable hypo-\nthesis; or, if she had not subconsciously grasped the connection,\nthat by some odd chance the allusions to Grossing the Bar and\nIn Memoriam in 3Irs Verrall\u2019s script got telepathically trans-\nferred to IMrs Pipei\u2019, and emerged by another happy accident\n\u2018Note that \u201cArthur Hallam\u201d was first uttered in the waking-stage of Mrs\nPiper\u2019s trance within two hours of the time when the quotation from In\nMemoriam was written in Mrs VerralPs script, and accordingly before there\ncould have been anything to suggest In Memoriam or Arthur Hallam to\nJ. G. P.\u2019s mind.\nNote also the anxiety of Myersp to bring out the fact that he had previously\nuttered the words \u201cArthur Hallam\u201d through Mrs Piper.

Mrs\nVerrall did not know that there had been any allusion to afro?\novparog uKvpon> in the trance until after the sitting of March 13,\nby which time her detailed note was in J. G. P.\u2019s hands.\nTo sum up :\n\u2014It appears that, in the absence of all intercourse\nbetween Mrs Pijjer and Mrs Verrall after Jan. 30, on the one\nhand the \u201cMyers\u201d of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script on Feb. 26 and\nMarch G, resj^ectively, connected Grossing the Bar and In\nMemormm with avrog ovpavog aKi'p-on'\n;\nwhile on the other\nhand the \u201cMyers\u201d of IMrs Piper\u2019s trance on March 6 alluded\nto Grossing the Bar and mentioned the name \u201cArthur Hal lam \u201d\nin close conjunction with Mrs Verrall\u2019s Christian name ;\nclaimed\non March 13 to have given to Mrs Verrall a quotation from\nGrossing the 13ar, and further explained that he thought this\nreference would make Mrs Verrall understand in part what\nsignificance the Greek words had for him.\no\nIf strict chronological sequence were to be observed, at this\npoint should be inserted the whole of the subject-matter of\nSection XX, entitled \u201c Azure and Horizon \u201d\n;\nbut the develop-\nments tliere described are so indirectly related to the central\nincident that to introduce an account of them here, though\nit would preserve the chronological order, woirld interrupt the\nexposition of the main theme and have the disti-acting effect\nof an unwieldy parenthesis.\nThe Test-Question repeated and further answers to\nIT given in the tkance.\nThe sittino; of March 13 was the last of which J. G. P had\ncharge ;\nafter that date Mrs Sidgwick took over the manage-\nment of the sittings, and from that time to April 24 the\ntrance-personalities did not explicitly add anything by way of\nanswer to Mrs Veri'all\u2019s question, though, as will be seen on\nreference to pp. 133-4, it seems not unlikely that some words\n\f131\n].vil] a Series of Concordant AiUomaMsms.\nuttered in the waking-stage of the trance of April 8 indicate\na first attem|.)t on tlie part of Myersp to connect airo? ovparog\ndKvfjLwv with Plotinus. So far, then, though the Greek words\nhad been paraphrased and knowledge shown of what may be\ncalled the Tennyson group of associations, no explicit allusion\nhad been made in the trance to the other g)-oup of as.sociations,\nnamely those with Plotinus and the second volume of Human\nPersonality\n.\nIt was therefore thought desirable to revive interest in\nthe matter by introducing Mrs Verrall again as a sitter.\nAccordingly she attended a sitting on April 29, and in the\ncourse of it she repeated to Myersp the question about ai\u2019T09\noupai'og uKup-wv, and, after explaining that one group of associa-\ntions and the meaning of the words had been made clear,\nasked for an allusion to the second group of associations and\nto the name of the Greek authoi' of the words. In making\nthis suggestion Mrs Verrall took care to mention no distinctive\nnames, but to use only the general term \u201c associations \u201d, so\nthat, in this repetition of the question, no clue was given as\nto which statements by MyerSp had led Mi\u2019s Verrall to the\nconclusion that her question had been understood and partly\nanswered.\nAt this sitting allusion was made to the words \u201cazure\u201d\n\u201c a blue sea \u201d. The words were mis-read by Mrs Verrall and\nwere unintelligible to her even when deciphered by Miss Johnson,\nas she knew nothing of the succe.ssful cross-correspondence of\nApril 15 and 17 described in Section XX.\nThere was much confusion in this sitting, most of it due\n|)robably to Mrs Verrall\u2019s difficulty in deciphering the script.\nIt seems, however, fairly cleai' that, after the allusion to\n\u201cazure\u201d and \u201cblue sea\u201d, for the first time a connection was\nsuggested by Myersp between the three Greek words and\n\u201c halcyon days \u201d\n;\nwhence it may be inferred that the trance-\npersonality had grasped not only the general meaning of the\nGreek words but also their connection with earlier passages in\nMrs Verrall\u2019s own scidpt. But still there was no mention of\nPlotinus or Humani Personality, and no light seemed to be\nthrown on the subject by a sudden and at the time inexpli-\ncable allusion, in the midst of the discussion, just before the\n\f132 -\/.

To Miss Johnson when alone it was plainly stated\nMyersp that his \u201c reply to the three Greek words \u201d was\nthat tliey reminded him of \u201c Homer\u2019s Illiard \u201d (sic). This\nstatement was repeated to Mrs Verrall on her entering the\nroom, thus :\n(Rector communicating) Good morning, I am glad to greet\nyou again.\nMrs V. Thank j'ou, good morning.\nI have seen Mr Xlyers and he gave me his reply to your\nGreek words and I gave them to the other lady before\nyou appeared Tell her to speak them. All right.\nHOMER\u2019S I L L I A R D.\nThis seemed to Mrs X^errall mere nonsense, and suggested\nrandom gues.sing on the part of Mrs Piper, but she did not\nexpress any criticism. Later in the sitting MyerSp claimed to\nhave completed the answer to the Greek question, reminding\nMrs X^errall that she had asked for the author\u2019s name and\nsaying that this reminded him of \u201c Socratese \u201d (sic) as well as\nof \u201c Homer\u2019s Illiard \u201d (see Ap}>endix ju).\nThis again seemed mere nonsense. No association of ideas\ncould be traced between Plotinus on the one hand, and\nSocrates or Homer\u2019s Iliad on the other. Certainly Mrs Verrall\nsaw none at the moment, nor was any connexion perceived or\nsuspected by either Miss Johnson, Mrs. Sidgwick, or J. G. P.,\nwhen soon after the sitting they discussed the record.\nBut latei' in the day a dim im])ression came to Mrs Ven'all,\naftei' thinking over what had been said at the sitting, that\nin the second volume of Human Personality, close to the\npassage about the vision of Plotinus in which occurs the trans-\nlation of the woids ku\\ cn\u2019rof oiiparb? aKuniccp was an allusion\nto the famous vision of Socrates, in which the woman of\nPhthia addressed him in a line from the Iliad.

Moreover, to the Epilogue of Human\nPersoncdity, in wliich the Vision of Plotinus is described, is\nprefixed a quotation in Greek from Plato\u2019s Krito, the passage\nquoted being that in which the story of Socrates\u2019 Alsion of\nthe \u201c fair and wlrite-robed tvoman \u201d is told. The line from\nthe Iliad (II. ix. 3G3) spoken by the woman in the Ansion\nof Socrates is therefore Cjiioted in Greek (p. 278) and trans-\nlated (p. 274) in the second volume of Human Personcdity\n,\nbut on neither occasion is there any reference either to the\npoem from \\vhich it comes\u2014-the Iliad\u2014or to the author of\nthat poem\u2014Homer. It would not therefore have been possible\nfor anyone but a Greek scholar familiar with Greek literature\nto discover from these pages of Humctn Personcdity any\nconnexion between the A^ision of Socrates and Homer\u2019s Iliad,\neven if he had sufficient familiarity with those pages to be\nreminded of the Vision of Socrates by an allusion to the Alsion\nof Plotinus.\nBut the reference to Homer\u2019s Iliad on April 30 was not\nthe first that had been made to it in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance.\nThe word \u201c Iliad \u201d had been pronounced in the waking-stage\nof the trance of April 8 in the following context :\n\u2014\n\u201cThey said Elliot.

Piddington.\nThe \u201cElliot\u201d of the record represents in all probability a mis-\nhearing or a mispronunciation of \u201cIliad\u201d. The name \u201cElliot\u201d\nhad two distinct associations with Mr Myers, both familiar to\nthe recorder, Mrs Sidgwick. Consequently it would have been\nvery easy for her to mistake an indistinctly uttered \u201c Iliad\n\u201d\nfor \u201c Elliot There had been nothing whatever in what had\ntaken place ju\u2019evioirsly at this sitting to suggest either \u201c Elliot\n\u201d\nor \u201cIliad\u201d. No significance has been discovered for \u201cElliot\u201d;\nand none was discovered for \u201c Iliad \u201d until cwro? ovpavo^ aKvfxwv\nwas connected witli \u201c Homer\u2019s Iliad \u201d in the trance of April 30.\nIt will be noticed that this utterance of the solitary word\n\u201cIliad\u201d occurs in close proximity to \u201cMr Myers\u201d, \u201cLight in\nWest \u201d and \u201c If I can reach over the bar \u201d. The connection of\nca\u2019To? ovpavo<i ukv\/ulow with \u201c Light in West \u201d is explained in\nsection XIX ;\nand its connection with Grossing the Bar, to\nwhich the expression \u201c reach over the bar \u201d must allude, has\nalready been explained. It looks then as if the \u201c Iliad \u201d uttered\non April 8 was a fir.st attempt to give the associations of the\nthree Greek words of Plotinus with Human Personality. And\nif it was so, it follows that the Plotinian associations began\nto emerge in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance three weeks before i\\lrs Verrall,\nwho had not come in contact with Mrs Piper since Jan. 30,\nattended the sitting of April 29 for the express purpose of\nasking Myers^ to give the name of the author of the Greek\nwords.\nThe discovery, that it was not unreasonable for a question\nas to the authorship ot the words acTO? ofpard? uKupwr to\nrecall \u201c Socrates \u201d and \u201c Homer\u2019s Iliad \u201d to an intelligence\nfamiliar with the concluding chapters of Human Personality,\nsuggested that in the same source might be found an explana-\ntion of the ap|)arently meaningless introduction of the names\nof Swedenborg, St. Paul and Dante.\nOn the same page that contains the phrase, \u201c the eagle soaring-\nabove the tomb of I\u2019lato \u201d, and near the beginning of Myers\u2019s\naccount of Ecstasy (p. 261), is a commemorative list of the \u201c strong\nsonls who have claimed to feel it\u201d, and among these, after Plotinus\nand before Tennyson, are included Swedenborg, St. Paul and\nDante.

Again, Myersp, who had on March\n13 connected the words of Plotinus with Crossing the Bar,\nconnected them on April 29 with St. Paul. The author of\nHuman Personality had in the Epilogue of that work alluded\nto St. Paul, Crossing the Bar and Plotinus, all within a space\nof sis lines: \u201cthere needs,\u201d he wrote, \u201cno heroism, no sanctity,\nto inspire the apostle\u2019s e\u2014iOujuia et^ to uvaXvaai, the desire to\nlift our anchor, and sail out beyond the bar \u201d\n;\nand three\nlines later introduced a translation of a passage from the\nEnneacles ^ with the words \u201c says Plotinus \u201d (p. 290, section\n1013).\nThus, though the name of the author of the Greek words\nhad not been given, the mention of Swedenborg, St. Paul and\nDante, and more markedly the mention of Socrates and Homer\u2019s\nIliad suggested that the trance-personality was on the right\ntack ;\nand moreover taking his bearings by landmarks singularly\nappropriate for a personality who purports to be the author\nof Human Personality.\nIt is conceivable that the words \u201c Sa.sia Saisia Francis\u201d given\nat the sitting of April 29, just befoi\u2019e the mention of Swedenborg,\nSt. Paul and \u201cazure a blue sea\u201d (see Appendix X p. 159), were\nan unsuccessful attempt to write the name of Francis d\u2019 Assisi\n;\nwho, though not included in the commemorative list given on\np. 261 of Human Personality Vol. II. of the \u201cstrong souls\nwho have claimed to feel\u201d ecstasy, might well have been.\nJust as \u201cLarches\u201d and \u201cLaburnum\u201d were given in the trance\nwithin 21 hours of the test-question being first put, so here\nHomer\u2019s Iliad, Socrates, Swedenborg, St. Paul and Dante were\ngiven directly after the question was I\u2019epeated.

G. Piddington, [part\nfactorily completed ;\nand in each case the pielimiuary response\nwas cast in a form so remote from that expected by the\nquestioner that its pertinence was not apprehended at the\ntime.\nOn May 1 Mrs Sidgwick reminded Myersp that he had\npiomised to reply further to Mrs Verrall\u2019s question about the\nmeaning and associations of the Greek words. Myei\u2019Sp said\nthey reminded him of a poem, but that there had been some\nconfusion, and that he rvould make his answer clearer. (See\nAppendix v.)\nCompletion of the Ansaver in IMrs Piper\u2019s Trance.\nTo Miss Johnson on May 1 and 2, and to Mrs Sidgwick\non May 3, Mrs. Verrall communicated the suggestion that there\nM'ere reminiscences of Human Personality in the Piper sittings\nof April 29 and 30, and emphasised the fact that the only\nthing now wanted to complete the answer to her question was\nthe name Plotinus. At the sitting held on May 0 Mrs Sidg-\nwick had intended to rejieat the enquiry for the name of\nthe author of the three Gi'eek words, but was forestalled by\njM}' ersp, who immediately after greeting her, said :\n\u201c Will you\nsay to Mrs Verrall\u2014Plotinus \u201d. The last tvord was not deciphered\nby Mrs. Sidgwick, and Avas thereupon repeated in large letters^\nPLOTINUS. Mrs Sidgwick then asked :\n\u201c What is that ? \u201d,\nand Mj'ersp replied :\n'\nMy answer to autos ouranos okumen\u201d\n[sic]. Thus on Ma}^ G was given the one point required to\ncomplete the answer to the question asked by Mrs Verrall on\nJanuary 29. Later in the sitting MyerSp claimed that two\ncross-coiTespondences had been successfully carried out between\ni\\Irs Piper and IMrs. Verrall, one dealing with Tennyson and\nthe other with BrowniugA (See Appendix o)\nFinal references to the Test-Question in the trance;\nAND Conclusion.\nThe answer was now complete, and subsequent references\nto the test-question were apparently meant only to draw the\n1 For the Browiiiug correspoiidence see Section VI.\n\f137\nLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nattention of a new sitter to two of its points. On May 27,\nSir Oliver Lodsfe beinw the sitter, Plotinus was said to be\nthe name of the author of Mrs Verrall\u2019s Greek words. On\nJune 2 it was further claimed that directly Mrs Verrall ha.d\nput her question Myersp had thougdit of Tennyson. This\nremark would seem to refer to the mention of \u201c larches \u201d and\n\u201c laburnum \u201d on Jan. 30. Hitherto in the trance these two\nwords had not been connected either with the test-question\nor with Tennyson. If they are supposed to be so here, it\nmust not be forgotten that at this time the trance-personalities\nknew that Mrs Verrall had understood their allusion to\n\u201clarches\u201d and \u201claburnum\u201d and to Crossing th.e Bar; and\nfrom that knowledge they may have inferred that \u201c larches\n\u201d\nand \u201c laburnum \u201d had something to do both with uvTog ovpavo?\nuKviucop and with Tennyson. Still, if it was an inference, at\nany rate it was a correct one. (See Appendix tt.)\nThe trance-pei\u2019sonalities referred with some pride to the\nsuccess of this experiment ;\nand well they might, for in the\ncourse of sixteen weeks, from January 29 to May 6, they\nsucceeded in giving a complete answer to the test question\nput by Mrs Verrall. That question, connected b}\" Mrs Verrall\nwith topics mentioned in hei' own earlier script, required for\nits complete answer three things\n:\n1. the meaning of the Greek words,\n2. the associations with Tennyson,\n3. the associations with Plotinus and Hitman Personality.\nOf these the meaning was suggested, and the associations\nwith Tennyson\u2014in particular with the two poems In Memoriam\nand Crossing the Bai'\u2014 were given before March 13 without\nfurther communication with Mrs Verrall ;\nthe associations with\nPlotinus and Human Personality were given between April\n29 and May 6, after Mrs Verrall had had two further sittings,\nand perhaps began to emerge as early as April 8 ;\nand\nthe connexion with Mrs Verrall\u2019s earlier script was recognised\non April 29.\nAgain, while an explanation\u2014new to Mrs Verrall\u2014of the\nconnexion between the two groups of associations, Plotinian\nand Tennysonian, was given in Mi's Verrall\u2019s script on February\n26 and March 11, statements made in Mrs Piper\u2019s trances\n\fJ. G. Piddington.\n138 [part\nof March G and 13 suggest knowledge of this explanation\nvery forcibly indeed.\nIt is specially to be noted that the associations of the words\nwith Tennyson, and in particular with the two poems In\nMemoriam and Crossing the Bar, were mentioned in the\ntrance to J. G. P., who had no knowledge whatsoever as to\nthe authorship or context of those words, or of their associa-\ntions with either Tennyson or Plotinus. Again, whereas Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s own associations of the ydrrase with Tennyson\nreferred to Myers\u2019s poem on Tennyson {Fragments p. 117),\nwhich contains an allusion to Grossing the Bar but none\nto In Memoriam, the references in her own script were to In\nMemoriarn as well as to Grossing the Bar, and those in the\ntrance were to Arthur Hallam as well as to Grossing the\nBar. Thus, knowledge was shown in the Piper sittings of facts\naltogether outside Mrs Pijrer\u2019s own range of interest or know-\nledge, and those facts were all unknown to the actual sitter,\nJ. G. P., and had been in part unknown to Mrs Verrall when\nshe first put the question, and were not, at least consciously,\nknown to her uutil March 12.\nTo Frederic Myers all the main facts given in the scripts\nof Mrs Piper and Mrs Verrall had been known; the meaning\nof the words, the associations with Plotinus and Human\nPersonality, and the associations with his own poem on\nTennyson and with Grossing the Bar.\nWere the associations with Sections xciv and xcv of In\nMemoriam also knowir to him ?\nIn Myers\u2019s poem on Tennyson, to which are prefixed the\nwords Kcu uvTO'i ovpavm aKVfxo)p, there is, it is true, no allusion\nto In Memoriam-, but there are passages in other writings\nof his which establish the fact that the trances of the poet,\nand among them the trairce of In Memoriam, were a matter\non which he had deeply meditated.^ He was a great Tenny-\nsonian ;\nhe was versed in all mystical subjects and in Neo-\nplatonic literature, and in one of the closing and culminating\npassages of his posthumous work he had given special\n1 See, in the volume of INIyers\u2019s essaj's entitled Science and a Future Life,\nTennyson as Prophet generally, and particularly Modern Poets and Cosmic\nLaw p. 197.\n\fLVII.] Series of Concordant Aidomatisms. 139\nprominence to the Vision of Plotinus. Moreover, in Tennyson\nas Prophet he more than once compared the ecstatic states\nof Tennyson and Plotinus ;\n^ though, be it noted, nowhere either\nin that essay or elsewhere did he compare what Plotinus\nsays about the conditions of trance in Enneades v. 2-3 with\nthe trance of In Memoriaml And lastly, Tennyson\u2019s son\nevidently thought it likely that when asked to treat of the\nLaureate\u2019s work he might \u201c approach it from the side of\nPlotinus \u201d, though he had once already done so, rather even\nthan from that of his beloved Vergil.\nAll this may not\u2014does not prove that Myers had associated in\nhis mind the trance of Plotinus with the trance of Tennyson in In\nMemoriam, but it does create a strong presumption that he did.\nTo sum up : In this concordant episode of Mrs Piper\u2019s trance\nand Mrs Verrall\u2019s script the controlling influence in both cases\nclaims to be one and the same personality, namely, Frederic\nMyers. Let us, however, ignore this claim, and continue to\nuse the symbols M^^ersp and Myersy. The case will then stand\nthus : To MyerSp a cpiestion is put which could have been\nanswered by Frederic Myers. MyerSp gives various answers to\nit\u2014all intelligent and all but one provabl}^ correct. Before\nMyerSp gives his first answer, Myersy shows knowledge of\nwhat the answer of Myersp will be. Besides this, MyerSp\nshows that he knows that Myersy had previously shown know-\nledge of his (Myersp) answer. One of the facts comprised in\nthis first answer cannot be proved to have been known to\nFrederic Myers, but there are good grounds for thinking that\nit might well have belonged to that body of specialised and\ncharacteristic knowledge with which his mind was stocked.\nThe facts involved in the remainder of the answer given by\nMyersp were all known to Frederic M3-ers\n;\nand they emerged\nin a manner which indicates that the intelligence i-esponsible\nfor their emergence was as intimately conver-sant with the\nclosing chapters of Human Personality as Frederic M}\u2019ers, its\nauthor, must have been.\n^ It is, of course, assumed throughout this paper tliat iNIrs Verrall is familiar\nwith the published works of F. W. H. Myers.\n-See especially Ttnnyson as Prophet pp. 13.5-7. Had Myers wished to make\nthis comparison he could hardly have failed to have introduced it at this point.\n\f140 J. G. Picldington.

I quite understand.\nthank you.\n[I was at one time disposed to regard this statement as an instance\nof the kind of evasiveness not uncommon with trance-personalities ;\nbut careful consideration of the context has led me to think that\nthe \u201cher\u201d in the phrase \u201cI drew it for her and said Hallam\u201d is\n\f157\nLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nmore properly to be referred to Mrs Piper than to Mrs Verrall.\nAfter MyerSp had stated that he gave the quotation from Crossing\nthe Bar to Mrs Piper he is twice interrupted, first by myself, and\nthen by Hodgsonp who interposed the remark \u201c but we ask if she\nwrote D\u201d. MyerSp then goes on to add to his statement as if no\ninterruption had occurred, and accordingly \u201c her \u201d would naturally\napply to \u201c this light \u201d (i.e. Mrs Piper). I had evidently been dis-\ntracted by Hodgson\u2019s asking \u201c if she (i.e. Mrs Verrall) wrote D \u201d,\nand so took \u201cher\u201d to refer to Mrs Verrall also.\nBut it really matters little which interpretation is accepted. If\nwe suppose that MyerSp meant that he had given \u201cArthur Hallam \u201d\nto Mrs Verrall, then this experiment failed in so far as her script\ndoes not actually contain the name, although it must be admitted\nthat those portions of her script which refer to avro? orparos dKvpajv\ninevitably suggest the personality of Arthur Hallam. If on the\nother hand we suppose that Myersp meant that he had given Crossing\nthe Bar and \u201c Arthur Hallam \u201d to Mrs Piper, but only Crossing the\nBar to Mrs Verrall, then that absolutely accords wdth the facts.\nThe really important point was that the poem and the name should\nhave been unmistakably combined by MyerSp ;\nand so long as the\ncombination was made it hardly matters whether it was made in\nboth places or not.

IGl\nmy reference to azure a blue sea\n[There is much confusion throughout this sitting and especially\njust here; but I think that the main points at which the\ntrance-personalities were driving can be apprehended fairly\nclearly.\nMyersp begins by referring spontaneously to the Greek words ;\nand this gives Mrs Verrall an opportunity to ask for the\nname of the author of them to be given in the trance.\nMyersp has some difficulty in hearing the word \u201c author \u201d,\nand, when he does catch it, it reminds him of another\nquestion about an ode of Horace which Mrs Verrall\nhad asked him to answer. Eector spontaneously explains\nthat Myers has confused the two questions. Myersp then\nsays to Rector \u201cthe other reply you must get now so\nshe will U.D. me\u201d: \u201cthe other reply\u201d meaning, as I\nthink, obviously, the reply to the question about afros\noi'\/Dai'os u.KVfj,(Dv, and \u201cyou must get now\u201d meaning that\nthe intention was to give this reply at this sitting.\nMyersp then asks, in a parenthesis, if he can answer\nthe question about Horace some other da}q and then\nreturns to the subject of the Greek words. Mrs Verrall\ngot confused at this point, probably owing to her diffi-\nculty in deciphering the script, and thought that he was\nreferring to the Horace question. She asked if this\nwas so, and M}mrsp said \u201cYes\u201d; but Rector came to\nthe rescue and explained that Myers was not talking\nabout Horace at all ;\nhe did not, it is true, say that\nMyers was talking about the Greek words, but I think\nit is clear that by denying that the subject of Myers\u2019s\ncommunications was Horace he implied that it was the\nonly other subject which had been alluded to in this\npart of the sitting, namely the Gi\u2019eek words. Conse-\nquently I am of opinion that \u201c Sasia Saisia Francis\n\u201d\n\u201c Del Borg Sw Borg \u201d, \u201c St Paul \u201d and \u201c azure a blue\nsea\u201d are all meant to be connected with the Greek\nwords. When Swedenborg was mentioned Mrs Verrall,\nnot seeing at this time any connection between Sweden-\nborg and the authorship of the Greek words, thought\nMyersp was alluding to a talk about Swedenborg which\nin an earlier sitting he said he had had in his lifetime\nwith her. Myersp remarks parenthetically that he is glad\nL\n\f162 J. G. Piddington. [part\nthat Mrs Verrall found the reference correct, and then\nreturns to the subject of the Greek words again.\nThe phrase \u201c another character \u201d should be noted. One\n\u201ccharacter\u201d is Swedenborg, the other St Paul. Myersp\nsays he gave \u201cSt Paul\u201d both to Mrs Verrall and Mrs\nPiper. In Mrs Yerrall\u2019s script St Paul is not mentioned,\nbut in the waking-stage of the trance of March 13 the\nname \u201c St Paul \u201d was uttered disconnectedly ;\nand it was\non March 13 that the Tennysonian associations with afros\novpavus aKVfx(Dv were given. The word \u201c character \u201d may\nhave been used to indicate that \u201cSwedenborg\u201d and \u201cSt\nPaul \u201d were not mere names chosen for the purpose of\na cross-correspondence experiment, but that the emphasis\nwas on their individualities.\nAfter the mention of St Paul Myersp proceeds to recall his\n\u201creference to azure a blue sky\u201d, a subject clearly con-\nnected with the paraphrase of arVos ovpavo^ 6.Kvp.m\u2019 given\nin the trance on March 6.

[At the sitting of April 24 MyerSp twice said\nto Mrs Sidgwick that he had given \u201cVaunt\u201d to Mrs\nVerrall; but on neither occasion did he connect it in\nany way with the Greek words.

[Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nquestion about the authorship of the Greek words\napparently.]\nI remember repeating the name here well and I gave it\nas answer to your question.

This was all the more curious because\nMrs Verrall had previously pronounced the name Dante.)\nMrs V.

[Mrs Verrall had previously stated\nthat she had got the word in her script, so there was\nof course nothing evidential in the mere mention of it\nin the trance; significance, however, attaches to \u201cDante\u201d\nhaving been mentioned just after Myers had said: \u201cI\nwill refer to your previous question\u201d, i.e. as to the\nauthorship of the Greek words ;\nfor in the catalogue of\n\u201c the strong souls who have claimed to feel \u201d ecstacy\n[Human Personality Vol. II p. 261) Dante figures as well\nas Plotinus, St Paul and Swedenborg.\nNote hy J.

However wanting in definiteness many of the\nstatements made in this sitting were, it is important to\nnote that Mrs Verrall at the time took the references\nto St Paul and Swedenborg to be connected with her\nquestion about the authorship of the Greek words, in\nspite of the fact that at the time she failed to see any\nrelevance in them.

The first word spoken during\nthe waking-stage of the sitting of Feb. 26 (see above p. 94)\nwas possibly \u201cFairies\u201d. \u201cFairies\u201d on Feb. 26, and \u201cthe lad}\u2019\nsaid Fairer\u201d on March 11, look to me like attempts at\nrepeating, perhaps with the intention of explaining, the utter-\nance of Feb. 12. \u201cFairies\u201d seems to have been uttered by\nGeorge Pelham; \u201cFairer\u201d was attributed to \u201cthe lady\u201d. Who\nis roeant by \u201c the lady \u201d is a matter of conjecture, but she may\nwell be a lady again and again spoken of in the trance as\nco-operating with the group of which Myers, Hodgson and\nGeorge Pelham are the most prominent members ;\nand this\ngroup is especially concerned with the conduct of the ci\u2019oss-\ncorrespondence experiments. \u201cFairy\u201d occurs only twice in Mrs\nYerrall\u2019s script, once as quoted above, and once on Jan. 22 in\na script consisting of 16 lines of verse, of which the first eight\nrun thus :\n\u2014\n\u201cA thousand years shall roll\nA thousand aeons pass\nEre the imprisoned soul\nShall see as in a glass\nDarkly, a vision dim\nFlit, phantomlike and fair,\nA breath, a fairies\u2019 whim\nThro\u2019 the encircling air\n\f176 .\/.

She recognises and greets her spirit friends, who\ngive her messages for their friends on the other side, and bring\nher bunches of flowers ;\nand these she smells with keen delight,\nand will often exclaim at their beauty. In the series of sittings\nwhich took place in England roses were the flowers most often\nmentioned in this way, and roses and lilies the only flowers so\nmentioned. Violets were never thus referred to. And apart from\nthis it is perfectly clear that the \u201c violets \u201d mentioned in the\nwakiug-stage on March 11 were not flowers offered to the\nmedium by spirits but a word reported by her as having been\nspoken by a spirit.\nThe word \u201cviolet\u201d occurs twice only in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script\nduring the period under review ;\nfor the first time in the script\nof March 11, cjuoted above, for the second in that of April 29 ;\nand the passage in which it occurs on April 29 explicitly refers\nback to the earlier script.^\nThe envelope containing Dlrs Yerrall\u2019s script of March 11\nbears the postmark \u201c Cambridge 2.15 p.m. Mr.\u201d The\ndate is not legible, but must be March 11, as the envelope\nwas found by Miss Johnson on her arrival at Hanover Square\nat 10.45 a.m. on March 12.

In revising the\ntype-written copy of her first manuscript copy of the record\nMrs Sidgwick erased the tracing of the second word and sub-\nstituted the reading \u201c used \u201d.\nWhen I first saw the record I read the first word as \u201c Cup \u201d,\nand the third as \u201cC C\u201d, and I accepted wdthout question Mrs\nSidgwick\u2019s reading \u201c used \u201d for the middle word. I couldn\u2019t see\nany meaning in the words and thought no more about them.\nOn August 25, 1907, in the course of going over the record\nof the sitting of March 18, among others, for the purpose of\nwriting this paper, I noticed these three words, and again failed\n\f180 J. G. Piddington. [part\nto make any sense of them ;\nthough I had no doubt that \u201c cup \u201d\nwas the first word and \u201c C C \u201d the lastd Half an hour later\nI was searching through Mrs Verrall\u2019s script for some reference\nor other when I noticed that her script of March 19 contained\nthe names \u201cRussell\u201d and \u201cJohn\u201d and the drawing of a cup.\nI then thought that it would be advisable to ask Mrs Sidgwick\nto examine the words in the original script of March 18 again.\nThis I asked her to do without giving her any hint of how I\nread the words, or of why I wished her to re-examine the script.\nHer reply, made after a careful examination of the original, was :\n\u201c I should be satisfied with the reading \u2018\nCup used CC if it\nmade any sense in the context. The letter p seems plain, and\nthe contraction Cu into what is written [i.e. the contracted form\nof the letters Cu in the script] quite in accordance with custom.\nThe \u2018used\u2019 is almost exactly like the word in other places: e.g.\nthree lines above\u201d. I think Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s independent corrobo-\nration of my reading of two out of the three words makes\nthese two words certain. Mrs Sidgwick deciphers the middle\nword as \u201c used \u201d, and I agree that the symbols could represent\nthat word, but I do not believe that it is the true reading, though\nI cannot suggest a better. My objection to \u201c used \u201d is that\nto make sense of the phrase it must be supposed to be elliptical\nfor \u201c Cup has been (or, \u2018\nis to be \u2019) used as a cross-correspond-\nence \u201d\n;\nand not only are ellipses of this kind not, so far as\nmy knowledge goes, in keeping with the diction of Mrs Piper\u2019s\nscript, but, even if they were, the expression would still be\nan awkward and unnatural one ;\nwhereas the language of the\nPiper script is obvious, simple and unforced. There are excep-\ntions, real or apparent, but they are very rare ;\nand the former\noccur, I fancy, when there is some temporary difficulty in \u201c com-\nmunicating\u201d (which there does not seem to have been on the\noccasion in question), while the latter are due to wrong\ndecii)hering, and, as I have found more than once, disappear\nwhen the true reading has been discovered. Still, the two\n1C. C. as an abbreviation for \u201ccross-correspondence\u201d was used in the Piper\nscript both previously and subsequently to its use here : e.g. a few minutes\nearlier in this same sitting Rector, as amanuensis for Hodgsonp, had written :\n\u201c I want very much to work over the C.C. messages as I think Myers U.D. very\nwell now the modus operand! \u201d.\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Aictomatisms. 181\nimportant words are certain, and must mean that \u201c Cup\u201d forms\nthe subject of a cross-correspondence experiment. Two other\npoints seem clear: (1) Hodgsonp was communicating imme-\ndiately before the three words were written, and continued with-\nout inten\u2019uption to communicate afterwards. The sitter thinking\nthe letters \u201c C C \u201d stood for initials asked :\n\u201c Is it somebody\nelse now ? \u201d, and was met with the rejoinder: \u201c No, not at all \u201d.\nIn spite, therefore, of the abrupt and unexplained introduction\nof the words they must be attributed to Hodgsonp.\n(2) The}^ were addres.sed apparent^ to Mrs John Russell,\nherself an old friend of Dr Hodgson\u2019s, and the wife of one of\nhis most intimate friends at St. John\u2019s College, Cambridge ;\nor, if not actually addressed to Mrs Russell, they were at any\nrate written in the middle of communications addressed to her\nby Hodgsonp.\nI now quote two scripts of Mrs Verrall\u2019s which certainly seem\nto correspond in part with the incident just described.\nCopy of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of March 19, 1907, begun ai\n10.30 p.m.\n(Scribbles) a knot of blue ribbon.\nFinny not another\nRendall or Russell was the name.

I believe that the whole of the script of March 20 aims\nat giving expression to one thing, and one thing only : namely,\na College dedicated to S. John the Evangelist, e.g. St John\u2019s\nCollege, Cambridge ;\nand the manner in which the idea eventu-\nally attains expression is both curious and instructive.\nThe real goal (St John the Evangelist) is not immediately\nattained, the scribe has first to travel by devious bye-paths to\na half-way house on the main road (St John the Baptist), and\nfrom that point only is his progress direct and easy.\nTo this script Mrs Verrall appended two contemporaneous\nnotes ; (1)\n\u201c Mischahelhdrner. I once saw a bivouac fire high\nup on these mountains before a \u2018\nnew \u2019\nascent.\u201d\n(2) \u2018'fires . . . valley. I also once saw fires on S. John\u2019s\nEve in the Upper Pth one Valley.\u201d\nFirst, then, a fire on a Swiss mountain seen by the automatist\nis recalled. (Note, by the way, the assonance between \u201cfisher\u201d\nand \u201cMischa\u201d, as if the former was a first mishearing of the\nlatter.) This in turn recalls other fires seen in Switzerland on\nSt John\u2019s Eve, i.e. June 23; and these again suggest the\nBeltane or solstice fires. The fires seen in the Upper Rhone\nValle}^ (June 23), the mention of the solstice (June 21 or 22),\nand of the Beltane or solstice fires have helped the emergence\nof the Feast of St John the Baptist (June 21); and from the\nBaptist to the Evangelist the transition is easy and direct.^\n^ Mrs Verrall writes on August 11, 1908: \u2014\u201cWe twice saw fires high up in\nthe Alps, one on the Mischabelhorner, from the village of Fee in the year\n1885. At Fee we met Mr Gerald Rendall (now Head Master of Charterhouse\nSchool), and it was the only time (I think) we ever met him in the Alps.\nWe saw a good deal of him, and in particular he was interested in the climb\nwhich produced the bivouac fire. I think he and our party actually stood\ntogether and watched it ;\nanyhow we discussed it together.\u201d It was Dr Verrall\nwho reminded Mrs Verrall of this connection of Dr Rendall with the incident\nof the bivouac fire. This new information forcibly suggests that the name\n\u201cRendall\u201d in the script of March 19 was the first emergence of the Swiss\nallusions in that of March 20, and furnishes another reason for regarding these\ntwo scripts as complementary of each other.\n\f184 J. G. Piddington. [part\nIn a third note appended contem|)oraneously to the script\nMrs Verrall wrote; \u2018'The Evangelist etc.\u2014probably allusion to\nSt. John\u2019s College, Cambridge.\u201d The significance of this\nallusion, if, as I think we must, we treat the script of\nMarch 20 as the sequel to that of March 19, lies in the fact\nthat Dr Hodgson and Mr John Ru.ssell were up at St John\u2019s\nCollege, Cambridge, together :\n\u201c The Evangelist is our patron\nand we keep his Feast\u201d. It was clear enough that a John\nRussell or Rendall was connected with the script of March\n19, but there was no indication of who the scribe might be,\nfor the signature \u201cTuus\u201d, which is that of Myersy, belongs\napparently to the last paragraph onl}\". There is in the\nscript of March 19 a phrase: \u201cThis is the first time I have\nsaid\u2014John but that is not his name \u201d : which, if we assume, as\nindeed I think we must assume, some supernormal reciprocation\nbetween the phenomena of Mrs Verrall and those of Mrs Piper,\nfairly satisfactorily identifies Hodgsony as the \u201c 1 \u201d of this\nscript; for at the Piper sitting held on the morning of March 19\nHodgsonp for the first time unmistakably gave the name\n\u201cJohn\u201d as that of some one closely connected with the sitter,\nMrs Russell. I take the words: \u201c\n\u2014John ^ but that is not his\nname\u201d: to mean that \u201cJohn\u201d was not the name by which Mr\nRussell was usually called. He was, as a matter of fact, called\nJack by his wife and by Dr Hodgson.\nI will now summarise the evidence for my statement that\nHodgsonp for the first time at the sitting with Mrs Piper held\non March 19 clearly applied the name John to some one closely\nconnected with Mrs Russell.\nAt Mr Russell\u2019s first sitting on March 4 a lady communicates\nwho in later sittings is identified as the sitter\u2019s mother ;\nthe\nname \u201c John \u201d is not written in the script, but the first words\nspoken in the waking-stage were perhaps \u201cJohn and Nelly\u201d\n(they are marked with a query in the record). Hodgsonp\nsends no message to the sitter, and the only reference to him\nafter the sitter\u2019s entrance is in the waking-stage, when Mrs\nPiper in the course of describing her experience in the spirit-\n^ For the manner in which empliasis is thrown on the name John by means\nof a preceding dash cf. Miss VerralFs script of Jan. 12, 1907: \u2014\u201crobbing\nPeter to pay\u2014Paul,\u201d jr. 32.\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 185\nworld states that \u201c that lady had said that she was glad that\nshe had found Dr Hodgson The doubtful words pronounced\nin the waking-stage, \u201cJohn and Nelly\u201d, are in no way con-\nnected with Hodgsonp.\nAt Mr Russell\u2019s second sitting on March 5 \u201c the lady \u201d says\n:\n\u201cyou will understand when I say John and Ry are both with\nme\u201d. John was the name of the sitter\u2019s father, Ry the pet\nname of his mother. Hodgsoiip did not put in an appearance\nat this sitting.\nAt Mr Russell\u2019s third sittino- on March 11 the name John is\nO\nnot mentioned, and Hodgsonp is not referred to except in the\nwaking-stage and then only in general terms.\nAt Mr Russell\u2019s fourth and last sitting on March 12 Hodgsoop\nannounces that he is going to help \u201c the lady \u201d to speak to her\nson. In the course of this sitting, at whicli a good deal of\nconfusion occurred, the sitter said to Rector; \u201cAsk Hodgson to\nhelp Whereupon Rector wrote :\n\u201c He is helping the old lady\nall he can. He remembers you very well After this Hodgsonp\naddresses remarks to the sitter, and, though he tries to give the\nnickname by which Mr Russell called Dr Hodgson, he does\nnot attempt to give Mr Russell\u2019s name.\nAt Mrs Russell\u2019s first sitting on March 18 she is greeted\nby Hodgsonp immediately on her entrance with the words\n:\n\u201c Hello old chap are you first rate ? I am very glad to see\nyou old M \u201d. At this point he apparently perceives his\neiTor and corrects it spontaneously and appropriately by\nadding :\n\u201c Tell your old chap [to] understand me. I do not\nthink he did absolutely ;\nbut if you understand better than\nhe did, we shall get on finely\u2014first rate together. You\nremember how I used to walk up and down your dining room\nexplaining my ideas to you and him ? \u201d. To this the sitter\nreplies \u201c Generally \u201d\n;\nand then a word is written which Mrs\nSidgwick has left undeciphered in her record of the sitting.\nThis word, if there were any dot observable, would certainly\nbe read as \u201cJim\u201d, but there is no sign of a dot, and it may be\n\u201cJohn\u201d; and indeed I think it is, as the i is very rarely\nundotted in the Piper script. Whether it be \u201cJohn\u201d or \u201cJim\u201d,\nit is certainly a name, and I have no doubt was intended to\nrefer to and explain the immediately preceding \u201c him \u201d. Mrs\n\f186 \/. G.

But I\nthink Hodgsonp knew what he was about, and was justified in\nsaying; \u201cI understand perfectly what I am driving at\u201d. His\nobject, so it seems to me, was to signalise this sitting by\nthe reiteration of some simple topic so that a reference else-\nwhere to the same topic should at once recall its original\ncontext.\nIf \u201cJohn\u201d is the right reading and not \u201cJim\u201d on March\n18, then Hodgsoiip first said \u201cJohn\u201d on that day; but in\nany case the name is not explicitly applied ;\nwhereas on\nMarch 19 the name is clearly given, and it is made perfectly\nplain that \u201cJohn\u201d or \u201cJack\u201d is the name of the sitter who\npreceded Mrs Russell ;\nand, though it is not stated that\n\u201cJohn\u201d or \u201cJack\u201d is her husband, yet it is certainly im-\nplied\u2014e.g. in the phrase \u201cyour old chap\u201d\u2014that he is very\nintimately connected with her.\nI interpret, then, the words in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of March\n19, \u201cThis is the first time I have said\u2014John but that is not\nhis name\u201d, thus To-day is the first time that I, Hodgson,\nhave said the name John clearly through Mrs Piper; John,\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 189\nhowever, is not the name by which my triend was called but\nJack.\u201d If this interpretation is right, and if we are justified\nin taking the script of March 20 as supplementing that of\nMarch 19, the following coincidences between Mrs Piper\u2019s and\nMrs Verrall\u2019s scripts result ;\n\u2014\nOn March 18 Mrs Russell, the wife of John Russell an old\nCollege friend of Dr Hodgson\u2019s, has her first sitting with\nMrs Piper. In the course of it and while Hodgsonp is\naddressing communications to Mrs Russell, the words \u201c Cup\nused(?) C C\u201d are written. These words are abruptly intro-\nduced, and not only are unrelated to their immediate context,\nbut no connection can be traced between them and anything\nelse that was written or uttered during the sittings attended\neither by Mr and Mrs Russell or by any previous sitter. Shortly\nbefore these three words were written, a name, which is\nperhaps \u201cJohn\u201d, was connected with the sitter by Hodgsonp.\nOn the morning of March 19 Mrs Russell had her second\nsitting with Mrs Piper; and in the course of it Hodgsonp,\nwho clearly recognised that an intimate relationship existed\nbetween her and the previous sitter (Mr John Russell), re-\nmarked: \u201cwhen I said Jack or John you did not understand\nme at all\u201d; the name John this time being distinctl)^ written\nand mentioned as an alternative to \u201c Jack\u201d. After this great\nstress is laid upon the name Jack, which is brought in again\nand again in an apparently meaningless way.\nOn the evening of March 19 Mrs Verrall, who had no normal\nknowledge of any of these facts, wrote a piece of automatic\nscript in which appeared the name Russell, the phrase\n;\n\u201c This is the first time I have said\u2014John but that is not his\nname\u201d, and the word \u201ccup\u201d followed by a picture of a\ncup ;\nand after the picture came the words \u201c Try for more\ntomorrow \u201d.\nOn the morrow she wrote a script embracing a series of\ntopics, strung together by association of ideas, which issues\nfinally in what is certainly an allusion to St John\u2019s College,\nCambridge.^\nA few points in the two scripts of March 19 and 20, which\nI have not touched on so far, require comment.\n' One of the gates of St John\u2019s College has an eagle over it.\n\f190 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nThe rooms were adjoining and there was a better outlook\nfrom his. To be consistent with the interpretation offered\nabove these words ought to mean that Mr Russell and Dr\nHodgson when they were up at St John\u2019s occupied adjoining-\nrooms, and that the outlook from the former\u2019s was the better\nof the two. This was not the case, for Mr Russell, writing\nto Mrs Sidgwick on Sep. 10, 1907, says :\n\u201c Our rooms were\nnot adjoining. Moreover his [i.e. Hodgson\u2019s] were never in\nCollege except once or twice in a \u2018\nLong \u2019.\nHe always \u2018\nkept\n\u2019\nin Park Street ;\nwith an outlook from his sitting-room over\nMidsummer Common. (Is it so called?) My outlook was\ninto the second court.\u201d\nThere is something red. in this connection a 'picture on the\nwall I think of a hunting scene I have said something of\nthat before. Look back. Two hunting crops on the wall over\na silver cup.\nWith regard to this i\\Ir Russell writes in the same letter :\n\u2014\n\u201c Hunting scenes and crops were never at all in my line (or\nhis) and the only \u2018\nsilver cup \u2019\nI ever had in my rooms was\na pewter I won on the river.\u201d\nI have said something of that before. Look back.\nOn Jan. 10, 1907, Mrs VeiTall\u2019s script had contained the\nfollowing ;\n\u2014\u201c But the picture has colour in it\u2014red colour I\nsee and movement. In full cry the hounds are running to\nthe cover on the lea.\u201d\nThe unveridical reference to a hunting scene and hunting-\ncrops in the script of March 19 may perhaps be explained\nin this way. The real aim of the scribe was the expression\nof the word or idea \u201c Cup \u201d\n;\nand to get at it he liad to lead\nup to it by first introducing the idea of sport and sporting\ntrophies. Hence the revival of an eai'lier reference in the\nscript to a hunting scene. The word \u201ccrops\u201d may have got\nintroduced partly by a natural association of ideas with hunting\nand partly from the similarity in sound and form between\n\u201d crop \u201d and \u201c cup \u201d. Or, if we suppose that the scribe was\nalluding to the pewter cup won by Mr Russell, the words\n\u201cthere is something- red in this connection\u201d may have applied\nto the colours of the Lady Margaret Boat Club (i.e. the Boat\nClub of St John\u2019s College, Cambridge), which are scarlet\n\u2014\n\f191\nLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nthe scarlet, or very nearly so, of a hunting coat ;\nand the\nscarlet colours (or scarlet \u201c blazer \u201d) may then have provoked\na recollection of the script of Jau. 10 with its allusion to a\nh untin o- scene.\no\nThe Evangelist is our 2)cctron and we kee'j;) his feast.\nMr Russell writes :\n\u201c I think I do remember once keeping the\nFeast of St John at a great spi\u2019ead in Hall. But I fancy\neverybody in residence did so too.\u201d\nBut the unveridical references in Mrs Verrall\u2019s scripts do\nnot of course affect the main question of the cross-correspon-\ndence, which to me at least seems to be well established.\nThe script of March 19 is the onl}\u2019 script written by Mrs\nVerrall during the period under review which contains either\nthe word \u201c cup \u201d or a drawing of a cup. Now it is at least a\nveiy curious coincidence that the only time that the word\n\u201c cup \u201d occurs in any piece of script written by Mrs Holland\nduring the period under review is also on March 19.\nI quote the concluding paragraphs of this script only, as\nthe preceding paragraphs refer to quite diflerent subjects.\nCopy of p)(^'>\u2019t of Mrs HollamTs script of Mamch 19, 1907\n(begun at 10.4-5 a.-.m.

But the same word may intentionally have\n\f192 [part\nJ. G. PidcUngton.\nbeen employed in one sense in Mrs Verrall\u2019s case, in another\nsense in Mrs Holland\u2019s, and in an undefined sense in Mrs\nPiper\u2019s, in order to construct a less straightforward instance\nof cross-correspondence than would have I\u2019esulted had the\nword been used in all three cases in the same sensed\nStill, although the word in Mrs Holland\u2019s script undoubtedly\nmeans a cavity, the phrase \u201c inadequate for thirst quenching\n\u201d\nintroduces also the ordinary sense of \u201ccup\u201d as a thing for\ndrinking out of\nThe concluding paragraphs of Mrs Holland\u2019s script from \u201c Be\nin no hurry to identify \u201d clearly seem to indicate that some-\nthing is needed to complete the message ;\nwhich would in fact\nbe true if Mrs Holland\u2019s \u201c cup \u201d is one term of a triple cross-\ncorrespondence.\nI would particularly impress on the reader the very small\ninterval of time which separated the appearances of the word\n\u201c Cup \u201d in the .scripts of Mrs Piper, Mrs Holland and Mrs\nVerrall. The dates and hours were these:\nMrs Piper: March IS, about 11.40 a.m.\nMrs Holland : March 19, script begun at 10.45 a.m. Calcutta\ntime (i.e. 4.45 a.m. Greenwich time) and ended 10.53 a.m.\nMrs Verrall : March 19, script begun at 10.30 p.m.\nAnd I think that we may even fairly reduce this period of\n35 hours to 27, for even if spirits \u201c rest not day and night\n\u201d\nmortal automatists must\n;\nso if we allow Mrs Verrall 8 hour.s\u2019\n.sleep on the night of March 18, it results that within 27\nworking hours a word given in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance as a cross-\ncorrespondence was written automatically for the first and\nonly time during a period extending over six or seven months\nby both Mrs Holland and Mrs Verrall.\n* See p. 327 for a possible instance of the word \u201cscale\u201d having been used\nin three different senses.\n\flvil] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 193\nXIV.\n\u201c DIANA\u201d.\nExtract from record of sitting with Mrs Piper held on March\n19 ,\n1907 .\n(Present: Mrs Sidgwick and Miss Newton, the latter merely\nwaiting for a signal to summon the sitter.)\n(Rector communicating) Mr Hodgson is here and sends his\ngreeting.\nhe also wishes to ask if you U.D. that Mrs V\u2014 has written\nDianna.\nE.

I, 21 : an ode to Diana and Apollo.\nThere seem to be echoes, too, of Catullus C.

But leave all that\nmythology out of the question\u2014it has no place here.\nOn March 4 Mrs. Verrall had written a piece of script\nreferring to some point in a passage of the Hercules Furens\nof Euripides (v. p. 213) which the scribe had suggested that\nDr Verrall should think over. The allusion here to another\nclassical subject seems to have led to a repetition of this sug-\ngestion ;\nand the concluding phrase :\n\u201c But leave all that\nmythology out of the question\u2014it has no place here\u201d : seems\ndistinctly connected with the phrase in the script of March 4,\n\u201c not to mind the mythology but to .see another point\u201d in the\nearlier reference to the Hercules Farens.\nLeaving then the last paragraph out of consideration, what\ncan we make of the rest ?\nTwo distinct stories seem to be confused : one a story of\nan attack on some townspeople by a crowd of Bacchic\nrevellers ;\nthe other a story of the saving of a white shining\nmarble city by a goddess. Jumbled up with these two tales are\nallusions to Macbeth.\nMrs Verrall and my.self have taken a good deal of trouble\nto find out if there is any legend where a goddess intervenes\nto save her people from an attack by Bacchanalian revellers\n;\nand to the best of our knowledge none such exists.\nIf the Bacchic elements and the Macbeth allusions are\neliminated, the residue can be appropriately referred to the\nlegend of the miraculous repulse of the attack on Delphi by\nthe Gauls in 279 B.C.\nWith these eliminations the scri])t would run thus :\nDiva the goddess stayed the rout It is the invasion\nof a white shining marble city and the\ngoddess stayed the slaying of her folk. But\nthe arresting goddess is but a white sham. Remember\nthat the story comes from the victorious, or at least\nundefeated few\u2014the swarming horde saw no vision of\ngods, and the city they left was empty as well as\nclean.\n\f200 [part\nJ. 0. Piddington.\nI will now quote parts of J. G. Frazer\u2019s translation of Pau-\nsanias, Bk. X, 23, which contains the account of the attack on\nDelphi by the Gauls under Brennus :\n\u2014\n\u201c Brennus lost not a moment, hut ... . marched on Delphi.\nThe trembling inhabitants betook themselves to the oracle,\nand the god bade them have no fear, \u2018For\u2019, said he,\n\u2018\nI will myself guard my own \u2019.\nMeanwhile the Greeks who had mustered at Delphi drew\nout in order of battle against the army of Brennus, and\nsoon to confound the barbarians the god sent signs and\nwonders, the plainest that ever were seen. For all the\nground occupied by the army of the Gauls quaked\nviolently most of the day, and thunder rolled and\nlightning dashed continually, the claps of thunder stunning\nthe Celts and liindering them from hearing the words of\ncommand, while the bolts from heaven set dre not only\nto the men upon whom they fell, but to all who were\nnear them, men and arms alike Such were\nthe suderings and terrors by which the barbarians\nwere beset all that livelong day ;\nand the fate that was\nin store for them in the night was more dismal far. For\na keen frost set in, and with the frost came snow, and\ngreat rocks slipping from Parnassus, and crags break-\ning od\u2018, made straight for the barbarians, crushing to\ndeath not one or two, but thirty or more at a blow.\nAt sunrise the Greeks advanced upon them from\nDelphi. All except the Idiocians came straight on ;\nbut\nthe Phocians, more familiar with the ground, descended\nthe precipices of Parnassus through the snow, and getting\nin the rear of the Celts unperceived, showered their darts\nand arrows on the barbarians in perfect security.\u201d\nFiazer comments on this:\n\u201c The oracle vouchsafed to the Delphians by Apollo on the\napproach of the Gauls is said to have been this :\n\u2018\nI\nand the white maidens will care for these matters \u2019.

The rationalising\nCicero regarded the arresting goddess as a \u201c white sham \u201d,\ninterpreting the \u201cwhite maidens\u201d as the snow-storm.\nBut, gi\u2019anted that this identification is right, how is the\nBacchic element in the script to be accounted for ?\n1 imagine that the scribe was from the first trying to get\nthe automatist to describe the story of the miraculous defence\nof Delphi in order to introduce a reference to Artemis. Dr\nYerrall was about to deliver two lectures in London on the\nBaccJtae of Euripides, and this doubtless was occupying the\nautomatist\u2019s normal consciousness to some degree ;\nand so, when\nthe scribe tried to impress her with another classical subject, the\ntwo subjects got commingled with the result seen in the script.\nThe first attempt to express \u201cDiana\u201d is made in the words\n\u201cDina dos avdoo?\u201d.\n\u201c\nDina \u201d is, of course, very near \u201c Diana\nThe words dvdoo<s [sic] d a-oi eSwKu can hardly be translated,\nat least so as to make sense. If dvdoos is taken as the impera-\ntive of uvaSiSwfxi the words would mean \u201cGive up\u201d, or,\n\u201c distribute what I have given you \u201d\n;\nand there is not much\napparent sen.se in that. But the imperative singular of dvuoloco\/iu\nwould be accented on the last syllable and not, as in the sciipt,\non the penultimate.\nIf we suppose that the scribe was trying to make the auto-\nmatist write \u201cDiana\u201d, I thirds we may see a meaning in this\ncurious and hybrid collocation of words. He succeeds in getting\n\u201c Dina \u201d written, but not being satisfied with this appi'oximation\nto the name he drops into Greek and says to a collaborator\n:\ndos (i.e. (5o?) uvd, i.e. \u201cgive the sound \u2018ana\u2019\u201d; and then adds\nSoi <1 <joL eowKa, i.e. \u201c give what I gave you He then abandons\nthat way of trying to get the word or idea \u201c Diana \u201d expressed\nno he does not understand \u201d) and starts afresh and on a\nslightly difierent tack ;\n\u201c Sa\\^ it again.

When, then, I sug-\ngest, the scribe realised that he had failed to get the word\n\u201c Diana \u201d written he started afresh and tried to work in the\nnotion of a goddess, and in such a manner as to suggest the\ngoddess Artemis.\nNote the threefold repetition of the word \u201cgoddess\u201d preceded\nby \u201c Diva,\u201d the Latin for \u201c goddess \u201d, all within seven lines.\n(Cf for similar reiterations pp. 98, 178, and 223.) The word\n\u201c diva \u201d is, moreover, suggestive because it has three letters\nin common with Diana, and because Diva and Diana are\nboth derived from the same root. It may be advisable to\nadd tliat this interpretation of the script of March 13 is my\nown and not Mrs Verrall\u2019s, who never connected her script\nof Feb. 27 with that of March 13.\nBut what are the references to Dunsinane and Bircham (an\nobvious blunder for Birnam) wood doing among these classical\nallusions? I think that there can be no doubt that they\nwere derived Aom a script of Mrs Holland\u2019s containing\nallusions to Macbetlt and Artemis, which Mrs Verrall had\nseen. This script I shall quote and discuss presently.\nI was curious to learn whether Mrs Verrall had any theory\nas to who \u201c Diva the goddess \u201d was ;\nso on April 3, 1907 I\nwrote her the following postcard :\n\u2014\nWill you let me know who you take \u201cDiva the goddess\u201d to be\nin your script of March 13?\nShe replied on April 4 :\n\u2014\nDiva. I can give no name to this. There is no goddess in the\nBacchic legend, which is what the thing seems to refer to\nI take it to be Diva = the goddess (unnamed). There is a great\nmyth about Apollo saving Delphi, and I think that a goddess is\njoined in that story, probably Artemis ;\nand I have a vague\nimpression that Athena once personally intervened. But I have no\nknowledge, and no books here.\nO J\n\fLVII.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 203\nThe date of the first mention in the trance of \u201cDiana\u201d as\nthe subject of a cross-correspondence experiment suits the dates\nof the two allusions to Diana in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script. Her first\n\u201cDiana\u201d script, that of Feb. 27, concluded with the words:\n\u201c I cannot get the meaning cleai\u2019. I will try again.\u201d The\nresult of the scribe\u2019s second attempt is to be seen, apparently,\nin the script of March 13, which was begun at 11 a.m. There\nwould have been time, therefore, for the trance-personalities to\nhave announced during the sitting of March 13, which did\nnot end till after 1 yrm., the fact that \u201cDiana\u201d had been\nwritten by Mrs Verrall. But this sitting\u2014one of the best of\nthe series\u2014was fully occupied with other matters. The next\ntwo sittings after March 13 were those of March 18 and\n19; and on March 19 Hodgsoiip made the first reference to\n\u201cDiana\u201d in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance.\nThe word when first given in the trance by Hodgson\np\nwas written \u201c Dianna \u201d\n;\nthe second reference to it was made\nby Myersp and then the word was spelt correctly ;\nbut the\nnext time that Myersp mentioned the subject the word was\nspelt \u201cDianna\u201d again, and in his final reference it was thrice\nspelt with two n\u2019s. It would have been tempting to attribute\nthe double n to the amanuensis, \u201c good old Rector \u201d (to quote\nMyer.Sp) \u201c who does not understand a word of Latin\u201d, were it\nnot that on the only occasion on which Rector refers on his\nown initiative to this experiment he spells the word correctly.\nIn one cross-correspondence experiment initiated by Hodgsonp\nthe word \u201ctranquility\u201d [sic] was said to have been given\nto Mrs Verrall and it was explained that the word was pur-\nposely spelt with only one 1. It is therefore just possible that\nin this case the double n was intentional, but I do not think\nit probable, because if the mistake had been intentional the\nintention would have been declared as in the case of the\nword tranc|uility.^\nThe variants \u201cDianea\u201d, \u201cDen Diana\u201d \u201cAnnie\u201d etc. may\nhave been prompted by Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s remark: \u201cI think she\nwrote something like it, but not quite Diana\u201d; .so I am not\n1 Misspellings are not infrequent in the Piper script: e.g. \u201c infalibility \u201d,\n\u201cevesdropping\u201d, \u201c colledge \u201d, \u201cloose\u201d for \u201close\u201d, \u201ccontroled\u201d, \u201csatelite\u201d,\n\u201c Halceon \u201d, \u201cIlliard\u201d for \u201cIliad\u201d etc.\n\f204 J.

From Mrs Sidgwick (who could give\nonly such information as I supplied her with) he could get\nno definite response ;\nbut when Mrs Verrall appears on the\nscene he seizes the opportunity to get information from the\nfountain head. I think this is really rather I\u2019emarkable, inas-\nmuch as it exhibits the trance-pei'sonality maintaining an\nattitude of confidence and conviction in the face of the scant\nencourao'ement which was all that Mrs Sidgwick could oive.^\nIt will be seen that Mrs Verrall stated to Myersp that she\nhad twice had a reference in her script to Diana, \u201conce a\nlongish time ago to her name, and another time to a Latin\npoem of Diana \u201d. She was referring in the first instance to\nher script of Jan. 7, 1007, which so far I have not quoted,\nand in the second to the script of Feb. 27, of which a copy\nhas been given above.\nThe script of Jan, 7 runs as follows:\n\u2014\n(Scribbles.)

And it is particularly the last of these four\nconsiderations which weighs with me. For a mere casual\noccurrence of the name Diana in Mrs Veri-all\u2019s script to have\ncounted as a cross-correspondence it was essential for it to\nhave synchronised, or nearly so, with the announcement of\nthe expei\u2019iment on Mai'ch 19 ;\nor else to have been accompanied\nby a phrase which meant that it was the subject of a cross-\ncorrespondence experiment, or to have been emphasised by\nrepetition or by large letters. In the scripts of Feb. 27 and\nMarch 13 such emphasis is thrown by the way in which the\nscribe returns avain and again to the charge and circles\nround the idea of Diana. Yet I cannot dismiss the script of\nJan. 7 without first discussing it in connection with some words\nwhich were written automatically by Mrs Holland on Jan. 16,\n1907.

Miss Verrall under.stood\nthe reference to Marion Carver, but not that to \u201cDorothy\u201d.\nOn Jan. 14 Hodgsonp explained to Mrs Verrall that Dorothy\nwas a friend of Miss Verrall\u2019s \u201c who passed out years ago \u201d, and\nadded that she had a sister Marion still living, and there is\nlittle doubt that this Marion is intended for the same person as\nMarion Carver. It is true (though the fact may perhayis have been\nknown to Mrs Piper) that a Miss Marion Carver was a friend\nboth of the Verrall and of the Myers families, and was also\nknown to Dr Hodgson. It appears that the statement about\n\u201c Dorothy \u201d is incorrect. The point, however, which I want\nto bring out is that these two names were connected with\nMiss Verrall in the Piper trance, and that the most definite\nstatements about them were made on Jan. 14. A few hours\nafter her sitting on this date Mrs Verrall wrote automatically :\n\u2014\n\u201c Leave Dorothy for remembrance Dolly a child\u2019s picture book\nand a child in it\u201d; and tliough this throws no light on the\nmeaning of \u201cDorothy\u201d it clearly is related to the Dorothy\nmentioned by Hodgsonp.

This fact may, I think, fully account for Diana\u2019s\nhaving formed the subject of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of Feb. 27 ;\nand while it hardly explains satisfactorily her scribe\u2019s revived\ninterest in the subject two weeks later, it does explain why,\nwhen the subject was revived, allusions to Macbeth were con-\njoined with allusions to Artemis. But though Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nnormal acquaintance with Mrs Holland\u2019s script of Jan. 16\nexplains this much, it in no way accounts for the knowledge\nmanifested in I\\Irs Piper\u2019s trance of the fact that Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript had referred to Diana; nor does it account for the other\ncoincidences between Mrs Piper, Mrs Holland and Mrs Verrall.\nIn fact I think we have here two distinct groups of cross-\ncorrespondences : (1) consisting of \u201ccandle\u201d, \u201cDiana\u201d (Mrs\nVerrall, Jan. 7), \u201ccandle\u201d, \u201cArtemis\u201d, \u201cMaud Carter\u201d,\n\u201cDorothy\u201d (Mrs Holland, Jan. 16) and \u201cMarion Carver\u201d,\n\u201cIlorothy\u201d (Mrs Piper, Dec. 24); (2) consisting of \u201cDiana\u201d,\n\u201cArtemis\u201d (Mrs Veri'all, Feb. 26 and March 13) and \u201cDiana\u201d\n(Ml'S Piper, March 19).\nIt is an interesting fact that Mrs Verrall never consciously\nsaw any connection between her script of March 13 and Mrs\nHolland\u2019s of Jan. 16.

I\n\f212 [part\nJ. G. Picldington.\ngave both \u201d (v. p. 220). In its context this can only mean\nthat Myersp said that he had given \u201c\nSpirit and Angel\n\u201d\nto Mrs Verrall; and, if further proof is needed, a few lines\nlater Myersp added :\n\u201c Nearly all the words I have written\ntoday are with reference to messages I am trying to give\nthrough Mrs V.\u201d\no\nIn view of the fact that Mrs Verrall got two clear references\nto Euripides and that Mrs Holland also got a reference to\nEuripides which corresponded closely with Mrs Verrall\u2019s, I am\ninclined to think that the mention of Euripides at this sitting,\noccurring as it did at a point where MyerSp was explicitly\nannouncing and making enquiries about several experiments\nwhich he had recently been trying with i^lrs Verrall, should\nbe attributed to supernormal activity and not to chance. It\nwas given in a context that had nothing in it, so far as I\ncan see, to suggest Euripides or the sound of his name, or to\nsuggest the idea of any classical author or of a classical allusion.\nBesides Euripides only two classical authors, Homer and\nPlotinus, were spontaneously referred to by the trance-per-\nsonalities during the sittings given by Mi\u2019s Piper in England,\nand both of these allusions were veridical (v. pp. 132 and 136).\nThe word \u201c Harold \u201d, which was substituted spontaneously for\n\u201cEuripides\u201d, does not resemble the latter either in form or\nsound. If, however, we assume some community of consciousness\nto exist between Myersp Myersy and Myersn, it is not difficult\nto discover a plausible explanation of why this misplaced refer-\nence to Euripides emerged in the sitting of April 8. Assuming\nthe identity in some sort of these three personalities, I suggest\nthat MyerSp was on April 8 aware that in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript there had already appeared refei\u2019ences to Euripides ;\nand\nthat while he was mentioning at this sitting other words or\nphrases which he had impressed on Mrs Verrall\u2019s mind he was\ninvoluntarily reminded of \u201cEuripides\u201d. Moreover, just before\n'I understand the words \u201cI meant to say Harold,\u201d which immediately\nfollowed the phrase \u201cDo you remember Euripides?\u201d, to mean that Euripides\nhad been written in error for \u201cHarold\u201d. That is the most natural interpre-\ntation; but the words \u201cI meant to say Harold\u201d may introduce an entirely\nnew subject distinct from the preceding allusion to Euripides.\n\f213\nLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nthe mention of Euripides was made on A]>ril S, Myersp had\nbeen connecting the \u201c Hope, Star and Browning \u201d message which\nhe had given to Mrs Verrall with an unspecified poem of\nBrowning\u2019s. Now Mrs Holland\u2019s reference to Euripides is\nclosely connected, as will appear, with one of Browning\u2019s\npoems, and if the \u201cMyers\u201d who mentioned \u201cEuripides\u201d\nthrough Mrs Piper also inspired Mrs Holland\u2019s reference to\nEuripides, we can see how an allusion to one of Browning\u2019s\npoems might have suggested \u201c Euripides \u201d to him.\nThe scripts of Mrs Verrall which refer to Euripides were\nwritten on March 4 and March 25, 1907, and read as\nfollows :\n\u2014\nMarch 4, 1907.\nIxaLi'ojievos 6 'HpaKA?;g [Heracles is mad]\nHercules Furens [The mad Hercules.] Tell your husband\nfrom me. there is a passage in the Heracles not under-\nstood, about the pillar and the tying to it.

If \\ve suppose that the personality who mentioned\n\u201cEuripides\u201d and \u201cSpirit\u201d in close succession in Mrs Piper\u2019s\ntrance of April 8 was the inspirer of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of\nMarch 25, which certainly refers to Euripides and probably\nto \u201cSpirit\u201d, we can see bow it may have come about that the\nallusion to Euri[)ides on April 8 led this personality to allude\nshortl}^ afterwards to \u201c S|)irit \u201d.\nAlthough, for the purpose of dealing with the two cross-\ncorrespondences \u201cEuripides\u201d and \u201cAngel\u201d, I thus divide into\ntwo parts the script of March 25, both parts were, I believe\n\fLVII.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 215\nreally connected.

Just as \u201cHarold\u201d is closely conjoined in the\ntrance of April 8 with \u201c Euripides \u201d, so here \u201c Leopold \u201d is con-\njoiued with \u201cEuripides\u201d. The significance of these conjunctions\nlies in the fact that \u201cLeopold\u201d and \u201c Harold\u201d are the names of\nFrederic Myers\u2019s two sous. The name of his only daughter, Silvia,\nwas appended to a ])hrase in anothei' script of Mrs Holland\u2019s\nwhich, though not obviously, is indirectly connected with\n\u201c Euripides\u201d (v. Section XIX. p. 261); and the intention of this\nconjunction of the names of Myers\u2019s children with these three\ndifferent passages\u2014between two of which there was no super-\nficial connection\u2014was, as I understand it, to give a clue to\ntheir interdependence. The matter is further explained in\nSection XIX. p. 278.\nAgainst \u201c Lucus \u201d I have placed a quei y, though four letters\nout of the five are certain. The penultimate alone is doubtful,\nbeing in the original smudged with ink. In order to obtain\nan independent opinion I asked Mr Bickford-Smith to examine\nMrs Holland\u2019s script of April 16, and to say how he read the\nword after \u201c Leopold \u201d, I of course not giving any hint of how\nI read it and Mr Bickford-Smith knowing nothing of my\nreason for asking. At the first glance he said \u201c the word is\nLucas \u201d. He then at my suggestion examined the word under\na magnifying glass with the result that he read the fourth\nletter as \u201c u \u201d instead of \u201c a He observed that the glass\nbrought out the distinction between the strokes made by the\npen and the smudge made by the ink. This exactly agreed\nwith the opinion I had previously formed after looking at the\nword with the aid of a magnifying glass.\nOne of the characters in the Hercules Fiirens is AJ\/co?, a\nname which would usually be transliterated as \u201cLj'cus\u201d or\n\u201c Lycos \u201d, the y representing the Greek ^i. Robert Browning,\nhowever, had a habit of representing the Greek u by the English\nu ;\nthus in his transcript of Euri[)ides\u2019 Hercules Furens he writes\n\u201c Luk os \u201d for Lycus, \u201c Amphitruon \u201d for Amphitryon, \u201c Lutta\n\u201d\nfoi- Lytta, \u201c Bnux \u201d for Pnyx, and so on. The \u201c Lucus \u201d of Mrs\nHolland\u2019s script is a sort of comj)romise between Browning\u2019s\n\u201c Lukos \u201d and the usual L}'cus or Lycos. But, it may be\n\fLVII.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 217\nthought, this dragging in of Browning is entirely gratuitous.\nNot at all ;\nfor tlie reference in Mrs Holland\u2019s script is clearly\nnot to the original play but to Browning\u2019s version of it, as is\nshown by the introduction of the name \u201c Philemon Philemon\nis not a character in the oi\u2019iginal play, nor is he for that matter\nin Browning\u2019s translation of the play ;\nbut \u201c Philemon \u201d is\nclosely associated with Browning\u2019s AristoiAianes Ajyology\n,\nwhich\ncontains the transcript of the Hermdes Furens of Eurijiides,\nin this way :\n\u2014In Aristophanes Apology Balaustion tells to\nPhilemon the story of how, on the night on which news\nof the death of Euri])ides reached Athens, Aristophanes, flushed\nwith wine and with the success of his Thesmoplioriazousae,\ncame to her house and there justified his attacks on the dead\npoet; and of how, the apology ended, Balaustion read to\nAristophanes and the assembled company the Hercides Furens,\nthe original tablets of which Euripides had presented to her\nas a parting gift. The poem ends by Balaustion telling\nPhilemon that she sent the original tablets to Dionysius\ntyrant of Sicily, who placed them in a teni])le of Apollo with\nthis inscription\n:\n\u201c I also loved\nThe poet.

There is an instance in the\nPiper trance where \u201cMargaret\u201d was used, as I believe it was\nhere, to indicate that an attempt had been made to convey\nthe words to which it was attached to Mrs Verrall (v. p. 126;\nand cf. p. 285, \u201c May Verrall).\u201d\nIn Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of March 4 there is an even plainer\nindication that Euripides\u2019 Hercules Fuvens was to be the\nsubject of a cross-corresjjondence experiment: \u201cask elsewhere\nfor the BOUND HERCULES.\u201d (The binding of Hercules is\none of the episodes of the Hercules Fiirens.)\nIn the light of these facts the coincidence between the scripts\nof Mrs Verrall and MVs Holland cannot be held to be accidental ;\nand it has the air of a premeditated achievement. In neither\nscript is the communicator indicated; but I have no hesitation\nin assigning the two scripts of Mrs Verrall to Myersy, as they\nare analogous in style to the signed communications of this\npersonality. All that can be said in the case of Mrs Holland\u2019s\nscript is that a classical allusion of the kind is far more\nappropriate as coming from the grou]i of personalities of\nwhom \u201c Myers \u201d is the most prominent tlgure, than from any\nother of the personalities who play a part in her automatic\nwriting.\nOf the premeditation which I see displayed in the working-\nout of the correspondence between Mrs Verrall and Mrs\nHolland there is no sign in the words :\n\u201c Do you remember\nEuripides?\u201d written by Mrs Piper in trance on A])ril 8. But\nif, for the moment, we make the assumption that the person-\nality which calls itself \u201cMyers\u201d in all three scripts is one and\nthe same personality, a reason will suggest itself why Euripides\nwas mentioned in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance and why this mention\nwas made in so casual, disconnected and undecided a manner.\nOn March 4, and again on March 25, Myer.Sy had written\nabout Euripides\u2019 play, the Hercules Furens, through Mrs Verrall,\nand on the earlier date had told the automatist to \u201cask else-\nwhere for the Bound Hercules\u201d: in other words had told her\nthat he is going to refer to the subject through another\n1 Cf.

His scheme at this date was not to impress the other\nautomatist with the idea in precisely the same way in which\nhe had impressed Mx\u2019s Verrall, but, while retaining the central\nidea, to present it in a slightly modified aspect, as was done\nin other instances (cf. \u201cCup\u201d pp. 191-2, \u201cThanatos\u201d p. 298, and\n\u201cSpirit\u201d pp. 220-7). He had already in his mind the design\nto work the corresponding message through Mrs Holland by\nmaking her allude not to the Hercules Farens of Euripides\nbut to Browning\u2019s verse-translation of Euripides\u2019 play. On\nApril 8 Myers in the course of communicating through Mrs\nPiper has occasion to mention an unspecified poem of Browning\u2019s\nin connection with a message which he had previously given\nto Mrs Verrall; and then shortly afterwards proceeds to\nmention other messages which he had been trying to give to\nher. By a natural association of ideas the references, made in\nclose succession, to Browning\u2019s poem and to cross-correspondence\nexperiments with ^Irs Verrall remind him of the scheme he\nhas in hand for completing his Hercules Farens messsage (of\nwhich the first half had already been given to Mrs Verrall)\nby making Mrs Holland allude to Browning\u2019s HeraJdes; and\nhence his abrupt and spasmodic allusion to Euripides.\nThis way of putting it will, I fear, appear exce.ssively crude,\nespecially to the p.sychologist who loves long words ;\nbut I\ndo not see how eLse to express my meaning -without resorting\nto roundabout and tiresome phraseology, which, if not too\nobscure to convey any meaning at all, would only mean the\nsame thing.\nIt will be noticed that the simplest form of the common\nidea appears in Mrs Piper\u2019s script : the mere name Euripides.\nIn Mrs Verrall\u2019s script the allusion to Euripides is accom-\npanied by a variety of classical or mythological allusions.\nIn Mrs Holland\u2019s script Euripides is expressed by means of\nreferences to an English poet.\nThe differences in the normal contents of the minds of the\nthree automatists might, at first sight, seem to account very\neasily for the different developments of the central idea bj'\nMrs Holland and Mrs Verrall and for its non-development by\nMrs. Piper.

I do not press\nthis point, because I do not think that it much matters\nwhether l\\Irs Verrall\u2019s script of March 25 be interpreted as\n\u201cshades, ghosts or spirits\u201d or as \u201cshade, ghost or spirit.\u201d The\ncoincidence with the \u201c Spirit \u201d of the Piper trance is close\nenough either way.\nUmbrarum volitantia corpora may be reminiscent of\nAeneid VI, 292-4\n:\n\u201c Et, ni docta conies tenuis sine corpore vitas\nAdmoneat volitare cava sub imaOTue formae,\nInruat, et frustra ferro diverberet umbras\u201d;\nand this passage might well have been suggested by the\npreceding \u201c indignantis sub umbras\u201d, a misquotation of Aeneid\nXII, 952, where \u201cvita\u201d is used in much the same sense (and\nthat a very rare one) as \u201c vitas \u201d here.\nQuae tihi .... tavgunt forms an hexameter line, and mentem\nimmortalia tangnnt is a parody of the Vergilian \u201cmentem\nmortalia tano-unt\u201d.\nO\nIf we treat all the words from \u201cnon desine\u201d down to \u201csimple\nenough to me\u201d as parenthetical, a second hexameter line in\nthe style of Lucretius is formed by the addition of \u201c et nos\nattingimus caelum\u201d to \u201c haec cape, quis captis \u201d.\na\/iiimas.\n\u201c\nAnimae \u201d is used by the Augustan poets for the\nSouls of the dead which inhabit the Lower World.\nI have assumed throughout that by \u201cSpirit\u201d MyerSp had\nin mind a disembodied spirit, and not one of the other signi-\nfications of the word ;\nand I think I am justified in making\nthis a.ssumption, for had MyerSp wished to attach an impersonal\nmeaning to the word he would hardly have conjoined with\nit the word \u201c Angel \u201d, which connotes a personal being.\nMrs Verrall\u2019s .script during the period under review does\nnot contain the word \u201cSpirit\u201d or \u201cSpirits\u201d; but obviously\nit would not have been surprising if it had ;\nand had either\nof these words a.ppeared in her .script, even near the date on\n\f225\nLVii.] A Series of Concordant Aibtomatisnis.\nwhich Myei\u2019Sp said he had given \u201c Spirit \u201d, it would have been\ndifficult to treat it as more than accidental, unless special\nprominence had in some way been given to the writing of it.\nWhether we regard some part of Mrs Verrall\u2019s consciousness\nor an external intelligence as responsible for the script of\nMarch 25, the author of it, I think we may fairly assume,\nwould have recognised the necessity of meeting this obvious\ncriticism. How better could it have been met than by harping\non the idea, while avoiding the use of the English word, and\nby reiterating various Greek and Latin words equivalent to\n\u201c Spirit \u201d or \u201c Spirits \u201d ?\n^\nA trace of \u201cTo the Stars\u201d may just possibly be found in\nthe words \u201c et nos attingimus caelum\u201d.^\nA portion of Mrs Holland\u2019s script of March 27, which fell\non a Wednesday (v. pp. 206-7, and 291), presents some coin-\ncidences with Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of March 25.

But wings do not enter into the original\nlines of Lucretius ;\n\u201c with wings unfurled \u201d is Myers\u2019s own\naddition. Hence it is more probable that \u201c flaming swords \u201d,\nthough emerging first, was provoked by the latent idea of wings\nsuggested by Myei\u2019s\u2019s. paraphrase of Lucretius, than that \u201cflaming-\nswords \u201d suggested \u201c flaming walls \u201d.

Mrs Sidgwick replied that she thought\n\u201c cloud \u201d had not appeared, but that \u201c lonely \u201d had, though she\ncould not remember in what connection.\nOn J\\Iay 19, 1907 Myersp said to Sir Oliver Lodge: \u201cI will\ntell you that I have sent and succeeded (?) in making Mrs V.\nunderstand Expectancy trancpiility [sic] and cloud Give\nher my love and tell her this being my first opportunity to\nacknowledge the fact that the wortl did appear.\u201d\nOn June 2, 1907 Myersp said to Sir Oliver Lodge: \u201cI have\nsucceeded in getting another word through Mrs V. It is\nMontin [sic], one of my test words. I also note Lake LAKE.\nLaburnam [sic] and Rose leaf. All this has much meaning\nas you will understand later.\u201d\nIt will be seen that this experiment, or rather amalgam of\nexperiments, was pursued with great perseverance.

With all three of these groups is\nunited at one time or another a fourth idea : mountain or hill.\nIf all four are combined we get 12 different leading words ;\nlakes, rivers, stream, seas, cloud, dale, hill, mountain, lonely\nwandering, field, and sky.\nOut of these twelve seven\u2014dale, stream, hill, sea, river, mount\n\flvil] a Series of Concordant Atdomatisms. 237\nand lake \u2014appear in one piece of script written by Mrs Verrall\non April 6, 1907, of which the following is a copy:\n\u2014\nFor the first time\u2014let me say it plainly\nAsk for the painted feather, no not feather\u2014sounds like\nfeather fev feth\u2014Fetherbridge no it is some word like\nthat the painted Severn bridge\u2014the painting of Tever\nbridge\u2014that is what it sounds like listen again.

[part\nTo give the word \u201cLethe\u201d may well have been one intention\nof the scribe ;\nbut the sci'ibe may have had a double intention,\nnamely, to work in the words \u201c dale, stream, hill, lake \u201d etc. as\nwell as the word \u201cLethe\u201d.\nNo trace of \u201clonely wandering cloud\u201d appears in Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s automatic writing at all. The word \u201clonely\u201d occurs\nin her script of March 11 (v. p. 145) in the ])hrase: \u201cPresences\non the eternal hills .... The Presence that is in the lonely\nhills\u201d. \u201cLonely\u201d, it will be noted, occurs in close connexion\nboth with the word \u201c hills \u201d and with the Wordsworthian\nphrase, \u201c the eternal hills \u201d.\nThere is not in Mrs Veriall\u2019s script any combination of the\nideas of \u201c Mountain, field and sky \u201d.\nAs regards the words given in the trance which do appear\nin Mrs Verrall\u2019s scri])t, the points which, to my mind, tell\nstrongly against their appeai\u2019auce being due to chance are\nthese :\n(1) On April 15 Rector says \u201csomething like Mountain\u201d\nhas been given to Mrs Verrall; and this, as I understand it,\nis expanded in the waking-stage of April 17 to \u201cO\u2019er mountains\nseas and lakes and rivers\u201d. On Apill 6 Mrs Verrall had\nwritten a dowerel of twelve lines, in the last four of which\noccur the words \u201csea\u201d, \u201clake\u201d, \u201criver\u201d and \u201cmount\u201d;\n(2) The persistency with which the trance-personalities enquire\nwhether \u201c mountain \u201d has got through; and the confident state-\nment by Myersp on June 2 that Mrs Verrall has written both\n\u201cmountain\u201d and \u201clake\u201d; (3) The spontaneous expression of\nopinion by MyerSp on May 1 that Mrs Verrall had understood\nthe word as \u201c lake \u201d instead of \u201c lakes \u201d\n;\nand the appearance of\n\u201cmount\u201d in the script, which does not correspond badly with\nRector\u2019s \u201csomething like mountain,\u201d and with the statement\nof Hodgsonp : \u201cI believe mountain got paifly through\u201d; (4)\nThe appearance in the script of April 6, in addition to the\nwords mentioned in (1), of (a) the word \u201chill\u201d, which Myersp\nsaid on May 1 might be taken as equivalent to \u201c mountain \u201d,\nand of (b) the words \u201cdale and hill\u201d, which, though not\ndirectly connected by Myersp with \u201c seas lakes and rivers \u201d,\nare connected with \u201clonely\u201d and \u201ccloud\u201d, with which \u201cmoun-\ntain\u201d \u201clonely\u201d and \u201ccloud\u201d were in turn connected on May 7;\n\flvil] 229\nA Series of Concordant Aiitomatisms.\nand (5) the conjunction of \u201clonely\u201d and \u201chills\u201d in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript in close connection with a ^Yordsworthian phrase.\nTt seems likely that the surroundings in which Mrs Verrall\nwas staying on April 6 both helped the ideas to emerge and\ninfluenced the mode of their expression. \u201cDale\u2014stream\n\u2014\nrill\u2014vale\u201d were all words which the scenery of IMatlock might\nsuggest; and \u201ckill\u201d it must have suggested. l\\Iyersp, let me\nconjecture, was making a second attempt to impress the auto-\nmatist with \u201c I wandered lonely as a cloud that floats o\u2019er\ndale and hill \u201d\n;\nthe attempt was but partially successful,\nonly \u201chill\u201d and \u201cdale\u201d getting written; so abandoning this\nexperiment and taking advantage of a momentary ascendancy\nin the automatist\u2019s mind of thoughts connected with physical\nscenery, he started a new experiment, namely, to get a I\u2019eference\nto the Mountain of Purgatory. Aware both of the setting\nand of the form in which the main idea had emerged into\npartial expression in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script, Myersp afterwards\nconveyed the main idea\u2014mountain\u2014through Mrs Piper on\nApril 15, and then two days later I\u2019epeated it with three of\nthe leading words which went to make up the setting or\ncontext in which the main idea came out.\nSome people may feel that the force of the coincidence is\nconsiderably weakened by the fact that three out of the seven\ncoincidental words were known bj\u2019 iMrs A^errall to have been\nused for the purpose of a cross-correspondence with another\nautomatist, Mrs Thompson. That is far from nw own opinion.\nOn the contrary, I believe that this very knowledge woidd\nhave been far more likely to liave inhibited the reproduction\nof these words in her automatic script. Mrs Verrall\u2019s normal\nconsciousness, there are good grounds for thinking, often holds\nher subconscious impulses in check ;\nand in this case she would\nthink it unlikely that the ti-ance-personalities would be going\non with an experiment nearly identical with one tried more\nthan ten wmeks earlier and one which, as they knew, was\nwithin her knowledge.\nThe initials E. G. appended to the script of April 6,\nhave not appeared before or since in Mrs Verrall\u2019s automatic\nwriting. She did not recognise in them the initials of any dead\nor living friend of hers; but she told me in September 1907\n\f240 .\/. G. Piddington. [part\nthat she always had taken them to be a bad shot at those of\na friend (known also to Mr Mjmrs), whose initials before her\nmarriage were E. W. C., the W. standing for \u2018Wordsworth\u2019;\nand ^she had thought that they suggested that the foregoing\nscript referred to the Wordsworth country. Long before I\nreceived this information from Mrs Verrall I had noticed a\ncertain resemblance between \u201c O\u2019er mountains seas and lakes\nand rivers \u201d etc. and the first verse of a poem by F. W. H.\nMyers, published after his death in Fragments of Prose and\nPoetry :\n\u201c O Rock and torrent, lake and hill,\nHalls of a home austerely still.\nRemote and solemn view !\nO valley, where the wanderer sees\nBeyond that towering arch of trees\nHedvellyn and the blue!\u201d^\nThe scenery of the poem is, of course, that of the Wordsworth\ncountry. The \u201c Torrent \u201d, \u201c lake \u201d, \u201c hill \u201d, \u201c valley\u201d, \u201c Helvellyn \u201d,\n\u201c the blue \u201d, \u201c remote \u201d and \u201c wanderer \u201d of the poem correspond\nrespectively to the \u201cStream\u201d, \u201clake\u201d, \u201chill\u201d, \u201cdale\u201d, \u201cmoun-\ntain\u201d, \u201csky\u201d, \u201clonely\u201d and \u201cwandered\u201d of Mrs Piper\u2019s trance.\nI had noticed the resemblance between the cross-correspond-\nence messages dealt with in this section and Myers\u2019s poem\n\u201cO Rock and torrent\u201d not only before Mrs Verrall had told\nme that she thought her script of Apiil 6 might refer to the\nWordsworth Country, but also before I learnt that \u201cI wandered\nlonely as a Cloud\u201d is a quotation from a poem of Wordsworth\u2019s,\nand consequently before I knew that the scene of the incident\ndescribed in this poem is laid in the Lake district.^ Since\n1 This verse of this then unpublisliecl poem had been recited by Dr Hodgson\nat Mr Myers's request during a sitting with Mrs Piper held on Feb. 17, 1897.\nIt was therefore known to some part of Mrs Piper\u2019s mind.\n- The opening verse of Wordsworth\u2019s poem is as follows :\n\u2014\n\u201c I wandered lonely as a Cloud\nThat floats on high o\u2019er Vales and Hills,\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\nA host of golden Daffodils ;\nBeside the Lake, beneath the trees.\nFluttering and dancing in the breeze.\u201d\nThis poem is referred to no less than six times in F.

Myers\u2019s\n\fLvii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 241\n\u201c I wandered lonely as a Cloud \u201d is, I am told, one of those\npoems which everybody is supposed to know, I\u2019m afraid I shall\nhardly be believed when I confess that neither Mrs Sidgwick\nnor myself recognised it ;\nbut such was the case. I did not\nlearn the source of \u201cI wandered lonely\u201d until Feb. 1908, and\nit was only when I had learnt it that I obtained the clue to\nthe sequence of thought manifested in the ci\u2019oss-correspondences\nwhich form the subject of the next section.\nXIX.\n\u201cLIGHT IN WEST\u201d.\nThe phenomena which form the subject matter of this section\nare extremely complex, and to follow them propei\u2019ly the reader\nmust be thoroughly acquainted with Section XI (The ai\u2019ro?\novpavo? uKv\/j-wp incident). Section XVI (\u201c Euripides \u201d), Section\nXVII (\u201c Spirit and Angel \u201d), and especially Section XVIII\n(\u201cO\u2019er mountains, seas and lakes and rivers\u201d).\nIn the course of this report we have met with various\ninstances of cross-correspondence between Mrs Piper\u2019s, Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s, Miss Verrall\u2019s and Mrs Holland\u2019s automatic pheno-\nmena. These cross-correspondences have been treated as isolated\ncoincidences, complete in themselves and not knit together or\nrelated to each other by any common bond of thought.\nBetween the subjects of most of them there really was, I\nbelieve, no connection ;\nbut some of them, which in preceding\nsections I have treated as disconnected, really, as I discovered\nonly after those sections were written, belong together, and\nWordsworth. It may be well to add that I never read, nor to the best of\nmy belief ever had in my hands, this book until Feb. 190S.\nThe first line of the poem was correctly quoted in the trance, but the second\nline was misquoted thus: \u201cthat floats on high o\u2019er Dale and hill\u201d.\nQ\n\f242 J. 0. Piddington. [part\nwere, so to speak, links in a concatenation, or cubes in a\nmosaic of ideas which had been distributed among several\nautomatists.\nOf the cross-correspondences thus inter-related one has not\nhitherto been mentioned, namely, that which was represented\nin Mrs Piper\u2019s trance by the words \u201cLight in West\u201d. \u201cLight\nin West\u201d\u2014or rather the idea which a comparative study of\nMrs Verrall\u2019s and Mrs Holland\u2019s scripts showed to be under-\nlying these words\u2014proved (if I may vary the metaphor once\nmore) to be the leading theme of an elaborate concerted\nmovement. Yet, though I quickly discovered in the scripts of\nthe other two automatists the counter-parts to Mrs Piper\u2019s\n\u201c Light in West \u201d, and recognised the common idea which under\ndifferent guises ran through all three, I did not realise that\nthis common idea was also the common starting-point of three\ntrains of ideas which developed at first in divergent directions\nbut which came together ao;ain at other common meeting-\npoints.\nThis synthesis revealed itself to me only when I learnt the\nliterary source of that script of Mrs Holland\u2019s which I take,\nand had independently of this knowledge taken, to be the\ncounterpart of Mrs Piper's \u201c Light in West\nInstead of pursuing the course adopted in the other sections of\nthis report, I shall here, before citing the relevant extracts from\nthe I\u2019ecords of sittings and the scripts, first roughly outline the\nchain of ideas which I believe them to contain ;\nand I hope,\nby means of this preliminaiy sketch to make the reader\u2019s\ntask easier than it would be if he did not know what to\nlook for until after the evidence had been presented.\nThe concatenation or mosaic of ideas which I am about to\ndesci\u2019ibe I i-egard not as tlie result of telepathic cross-firing\ncasually exchanged between the automatists, but as the work\nof a single directing intelligence, or of a group of intelligences\nacting in concert ;\nand I consider that this directing intelligence\nmanifested itself chiefly in the communications of Myersp,\nMyersy and Myers^. On the problem of the real identity of\nthis directing mind\u2014whether it was a spirit or group of co-\noperating spirits, or the subconsciousness of one of the auto-\nmatists, or the consciousness or subconsciousness of some other\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 243\nliving person\u2014the only opinion which I hold with confidence\nis this : that if it was not the mind of Frederic Myers it was\none which deliberately and artistically imitated his mental\ncharacteristics.\nMy theory of the interconnections is as follows ;\n\u2014\nThe parent idea from which all the other ideas were developed\nwas suggested to the directing mind by an idea associated with\nafro? ovpafo? uKufxwv. It will be remembered how certain\npassages in her script had led Mrs Verrall to connect Section\nxcv of Tennyson\u2019s In Memoriam with these words of Plotinus.\nIt was from the last three lines of this Section\n\u2014\n\u201c And East and West, without a breath,\nMixt their dim lights, like life and death.\nTo broaden into boundless day \u201d\n\u2014\nthat was derived the parent idea\n\u2014\nthe Union of East and\nWest\u2014from which all the other inter-related topics were\ndeveloped. The developments took place in three directions\n:\nA, B, and C.\nIn Direction A. From the parent idea there was developed\n(1) the Identification of Opposites; which in turn suggested\n(2) Martha and Mary, and Leah and Rachael, who are cited\nby Dante in the Gonvito and in (3) Canto XXVII of the\nPurgatorio as examples of opposed temperaments. This Canto,\nwith its sequel Canto XXVIII, suggested various other topics\nmentioned therein : namely, (4) Geryon, the monster on whose\nback Vergil and Dante were borne from the seventh to the\neighth circle of the Inferno ; (5) the goddess Cytherea (Venus)\nand the planet Cytherea (Venus); and (6) the mountain of\nPurgatory, the River of Lethe, and the crossing of the Helles-\npont by Xerxes ;\nwith the first two topics of (6) were combined\nallusions to (7) the mountains and rivers and to the scenery\ngenerally of the Lake District; which suggested (S) the\nDaffbdils .seen by Wordsworth on the shores of Ullswater\nLake, and celebrated bj^ him in the poem \u201c I wandered lonely\nas a Cloud \u201d.\nIn Direction B. The union of East and West in In\nMemoriam xcv suggested (9) the identification of East and\nWest in Tennyson\u2019s Maud] and Maud suggested (10a) \u201cthe\n\f244 [part\nJ. G.

The union of East and West suggested (11)\nHercules as a type of the union of East and West ;\nand this\nsuggested (12) the Hercides Furens of Euripides, and (13)\nGeryon, a three-headed monster slain by Hercules in Erytheia,\nan island in the extreme West.\nIt will be seen that topics (4) and (13), (5) and (10a), (8)\nand (10b) respectively are expressible in identical words.\nThe above resume only aims at setting forth the inter-\nconnections in the very baldest and most succinct fashion ;\nand\nit does not pretend to indicate the distribution of the various\ntopics among the automatists, nor the order in which, nor the\ndegree of explicitness with which they emerged. It is only\nintended to help the reader to form some notion in advance\nof the line I am going to take in my interpretation of the\nphenomena.\nFor reasons indicated in Section XI I assume that on March 6\nboth M^mrsp and Myersy displayed knowledge of the associations\nbetween auro? oupavo? uKvpwv and In Memoriam, sections xciv\nand xcv. I shall further assume that, although he did not\ndisplay it, MyerSy possessed this knowledge two days earlier,\ni.e. on March 4.\nI now proceed to describe and discuss in chronological order\nthe automatic writings or utterances which, according to my\ntheoiy, went to form a complex whole. Homan numerals are\nused to mark the emergence of the several constituent elements.\nI.\nThe first topic emerged on March 4, on which date Mrs\nVei'rall wrote the following script :\n\u2014\njia.Lvope.vo'i 6 \u2018HpaKA)^?\nHercules Furens Tell your husband from me. there is a\npassage in the Heracles not understood, about the pillar\nand the tying to it.\nAn old story lies behind that but it means something in\nEuripides that A AV V has not yet seen.

In\na note appended to this script a short time after it was pro-\nduced Mrs Verrall wrote :\nThe scene of the binding to the pillar is well known, but the\nscript has thrown no light on it. See, however, Human Personality,\nVol. II., p. 290 for an allusion to the \u201creal Herakles\u201d of Plotinus,\nwho might appropriately be called a \u201cHercules Unbound\u201d.\nThe passage in Himnan Personality of which Mrs Verrall\nwas reminded by the allusion in her scidpt to the unbinding\nof Heracles runs as follows :\n\u2014\n\u201c I believe that some of those who once were near us are already\nmounting swiftly upon this heavenly way.

Mrs Holland\u2019s script is\nfar more broken up, and far less homogeneous than Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s ;\nso that, whereas it is usually necessary to quote\nthe whole or a large part of a script of Mrs Verrall\u2019s, in\nMrs Holland\u2019s case it is usually sufficient to give short\nextracts only.

The Club is said to\ntypify the East, and the Key to typify the West.\n\u201c Claviger \u201d in the sense of \u201c club-bearer \u201d is an epithet applied\nto Hercules by Latin poets ;\nbut in the sense of \u201c key-bearer \u201d is\nnever applied to him.\nIn the earliest Greek representations of Heracles his emble-\nmatic weapon is a bow and arrows. It is only at a later period\nthat he is represented with a Club (clava) and a Lion\u2019s skin,\nand these emblems are of Oriental origin. (v. Preller, Gr.\nMyth. II, 113.) Consequently Heracles\u2019 Club may legitimately\nserve as a svmbol of the East.\n\u201cClaviger\u201d in the sense of \u201ckey-bearer\u201d seems to occur only\nin Ovid Fasti 1, where it is applied to Janus. I have not\nthe least doubt that the scribe on March 25 was alluding to Ovid\nFasti I, where the attributes and functions of the god Janus are\ndescribed, and that in this passage of Ovid is to be found the\nclue to the explanation of the opening paragraphs of the script.\nI will accordingly summarise what Ovid says in Fasti I\nabout Janus :\n\u2014\nJanus is the origin of the year; he has two heads ;\nhe is an essentially\nLatin deity with no Greek counterpart ;\nhe alone of the gods sees what\n\f254 J. G. Pidclington. [part\nis behind and what before; he holds in his right hand a staff (baculum)\nand in his left a key (clavis); he had first been known as Chaos, and had\naccordingly been a deity of formless bulk ;\nbut when Cosmos had been\nevolved from Chaos he took upon him a form and limbs such as befit a\ngod, though traces of his original formlessness still remain in the same-\nness of his fore and hinder parts ;\nhe is the Opener and the Shutter of\nall natural processes ;\nhe it is who turns the pivot on which the\nfour quarters of the heavens revolve; who locks up War and sends\nforth Peace; he is the door-keeper of the courts of heaven, and, just\nas a door-keeper sees who enters and who leaves a house, so he with\nhis double face looks upon both the East and the West at the same\nmoment of time (Sic ego perspicio caelestis janitor aulae Eoas partes\nliesperiasque sim.ul.)\n;\nhe is the god both of beginnings and of endings;\nbefore the time of Saturn\u2019s expulsion from Olympus, he abode in\nLatium alongside the Tiber, and his dwelling-place was the hill,\nnow called in his honour the Janiculum, on which the temple of\nJanus stands; as war did not then exist on the earth, he was at\nthis time god of Peace and of Door-posts only, and as such bore for\nemblem a key. {Et clavem ostenclens \u2018 Haec ait, \u2018 arma gero.\u2019)\nIt will be seen from this summary that Janus in diverse\nways represented the union in one person of opposite qualities\nor functions : that he was, so to speak, an identifier of opposites\n;\nand it should especially he observed that he alone of all the\ngods could look upon East and West simultaneously.\nIn the same Fasti of Ovid (11. 543 et seq) is told the\nstory of how the other \u201cclaviger\u201d, Hercules, on his way from\nErytheia arrives in Italy driving the oxen of Geryon :\nEcce hoves illuc Erytheidas agoqolicat heros\nEmensus longi claviger orbis iter.\nThe oxen were stolen by Cacus, but recovered by Hercules\nwho fells the thief with his \u201c trebly-knotted club \u201d, and in\ngratitude for his victory sacrifices one of the herd of oxen to\nJupiter, and invites Evander to be present at the sacrifice.\nThe episode concludes with the statement that Evander\u2019s\nmother, Carmentis, who foretold that Hercules would soon\nbecome a god, herself became a goddess and has her festival\non the 11th day of the month of Janus {Possidet hunc Jani\nsic dea mense diem).\n\f255\nLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nIt may be that Ovid in applying the epithet \u201cclaviger\u201d\nto two of the principal figures in the first book of his Fasti\nmeant thereby to hint at some kind of mythological relation\nbetween the two. Anyhow the fact remains that Ovid seems\nto be the only Latin writer who uses the word \u201c claviger \u201d in\nthe sense of \u201c key-bearer \u201d, that he applies it to Janus, that he\napplies it to him in the same book of the Fasti in which\nhe calls Hercules \u201cclaviger\u201d \u201cthe club-bearer\u201d, and in which\nhe mentions the slaying of Geryon in Erytheia and that one\nonly of the labours of Hercules.\nOnce again {Fasti V. 621 et seq) Ovid refers to Hercules\u2019\narrival in Italy with the oxen of Geryon ;\nand then in con-\nnection with the story of how Hercules was the first to throw\ndummy figures instead of live human victims from the Sublician\nBridge as sacrifices to Vulcan. Janus and the Janiculum, though\nnot actually mentioned in this passage, must almost inevitably\nbe brought to the mind of the classical reader of it by Ovid\u2019s\nallusion (1. 621) to the Sublician Bridge. This was the oldest\nbridge across the Tiber, and for long formed the only and\nalways the most direct means of access to the Janiculum, which\nwas in fact the tete de qmnt of the Pons Sublicius.\nHonoured on this same Janiculum\u2014the site, according to\none tradition, of his crucifixion ^\n\u2014is another \u201c claviger \u201d, he to\nwhom were given the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.- To\nSt. Peter as to Janus the words of Ovid may be applied\n:\nIlle tenens hacidum dextra clavemque sinistra,\nfor besides the key both bear as an emblem the shepherd\u2019s\nstatf ;\nand, moreover, to both belongs the title of \u201cjanitor caeli \u201d,\n\u201c doorkeeper of heaven \u201d.\nWith these explanatory comments before him, the reader\nwill be able to follow the interpretation I am now about to\n1 According to one tradition St. Peter was crucified on the Janiculan near\nthe spot where now stands the Church of S. Pietro in Montorio. Another, and\nfar better authenticated, tradition places his martyrdom on the Vatican Hill\nwhich adjoins the Janiculan. Which of the two traditions has the better\nfoundation, or whether indeed either is deserving of belief, are, of course,\nquestions absolutely irrelevant to the point at issue.\n- For an earlier reference in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script to \u201c claviger\u201d, with apparently\na double reference to St. Peter and Hercules, see Proc. Part LV. pp. 298-.301.\n\f256 J. G. Piddington. [part\noffer of the thought which I believe lies behind the opening\nparagraphs of the script of March 25 :\n\u2014\n\u201c The epithet \u2018\nclaviger \u2019\nrecalls three different characters\n:\nHeracles, Janus and St. Peter. Heracles is partly Eastern, partly\nWestern, and his Club is one of the signs of the Oriental\nelements in his mythology. Janus is a purely Western deity,\nand the key is the symbol of his power of Opening and\nShutting\u2014one of various antithetical powers attributed to\nhim, of which another instance is his power of seeing the East\nand the West simultaneously. To St. Peter, an Oriental\nand first bishop of the Church that was to rule the\nWestern world, belongs the Power of the Keys, the power\nof binding and loosino-J of excludinof from or admitting into\nthe Kingdom of Heaven; and St. Peter\u2019s Ke}^s may symbolise\nthe Western, as Heracles\u2019 Club the Eastern world. All three,\nthen, in one way or another represent the union of East and\nWest.\nAll three, moreover, are connected with the Pons Sublicius,\nand two of them with the Janiculum. Heracles on his return\nfrom Erytheia stood on the Pons Sublicius and thence threw\nstraw-stuffed figures into the Tiber as sacrifices to Vulcan.\nJanus crossed the Pons Sublicius to go to his arx ;\nSt. Peter\nto go to his martyrdom on the Janiculum.\u201d\nPurthermore, the script contains an implicit allusion to the\nbridging of the Hellespont by Xerxes ;\nfor though it is the\n\u201cclaviger\u201d (in the sense, apparently, of key-bearer, not of club-\nbearer) who bears \u201c the key across the bridge and over the\nsea \u201d, the words \u201c trans pontem trans Hellespoutem et insuper\nmare\u201d involve a play on pontem and {Helles)pontum which\ncan allude only to Xerxes : the pontem being the bridge\nwhich Xerxes had built between Abydos and Sestos, and by\nmeans of which he and his army crossed Helles pontum (i.e.\nthe Sea of Helle, or the Hellespont). This allusion to Xerxes\nmay have been suggested b}^ an idea manifestly present in the\nscribe\u2019s mind : the idea, that is, of the union of East and\nWest as typified by Heracles. Heracles and Xerxes repi\u2019esent\nthis union in different ways : the one united East and West\nonly in a metaphorical sense, the other did so in a literal\n^Cf. the script of March 4: \u201cBinding and loosing.\u201d\n\fLVII.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 257\nsense by means of the bridge which reached from the shores\nof Asia to the shores of Europe.\nBut the emblem of the Club is by no means the only reason\nfor connectingr Heracles with the East. That the Greek legend\nof Heracles was largely influenced by and in part derived from\nEastern mythology is universally recognised. Thus Mr. E. H.\nBlakeney, the most recent editor of the Hercules Furens, after\ncomparing the story of Heracles with that of the Babylonian\nhero Gilgames, writes: \u201cIn fact, the parallelisms are too close\nto admit of any other explanation than that the Heracles-myth\nowed its inception to Babylonia, whence it made its way to\nthe shores of the Mediterranean in the dawn of history. Traces\nof its progress are to be found in the myths and legends\nattributed to Melkarth, the Phoenician Heracles; and, doubt-\nle.ss, the Hebrew Samson^ story presents many curious similarities\nto the Epic of Gilgames The sacrifice of quails by the\nPhoenicians was said to commemorate the I\u2019esurrection of\nHeracles, restored to life by the god Eshmun-Iolaos, who gave\nhim a quail to smell A Phoenician bas-relief has been\ndiscovered (in Cyprus) repi'esenting Heracles carrying off the\noxen of Geryon,\u2014a fact which bears out the contention as to\nthe importation of the legend of Heracles into Greece at some\nearly epoch. Herodotus describes the temple of Heracles at\nTyre, attributing to it an antiquity of 2300 years before his\nown time.\u201d\nThe allusion in the script of March 25 to Heracles as a\ntype of the union of East and West is therefore fully justified.\nBut what is to be made of the stress laid in both the\nscripts in question upon the tying of Heracles to a pillar?\nI can only suggest that the .scribe, wishing to intimate yet\nanother reason why Heracles may typify the union of East\nand West, hinted that Heracles was a \u201cpillar-god\u201d, and a\npillar\u2019-god who was in a way a connecting link between two\nother pillar-gods, one of whom, Prometheus, was the pillar-god\nof the East, and the other, Atlas, the pillar-god of the West.\nThis conjectural explanation, far-fetched though it may seem\n^ In view of what is said below the binding of Samson and his connection\nwith pillars should be noted.\nR\n\fJ. G. Piddington.\n258 [part\nto be, is not without some grounds of support, which I will\nbrietly indicate.\nFor the statement that Prometheus and Atlas were pillar-\ngods, and pillar-gods respectively of East and West, I refer the\nreader to a paper by Miss Jane E. Harrison entitled The Pillar\nand the MoAden {Proceedings of the Classical Associatio^i for\n1907, Vol. V.). The pillar-gods Prometheus and Atlas were\nbrothers; Prometheus accoi'ding to Hesiod {Theog. 517-522)\nwas bound, like Heracles in the play, to a pillar ;\nAtlas,\naccording to Homer {Odyssey, I, 52), upheld the pillars which\nkeep earth and sky a])art. It was Heracles who released\nPi'ometheus from his bondage, and Heracles who for a time\nrelieved Atlas from the labour of upholdinof his pillars. Perhaps,\ntoo, the myth about the two pillars (the Pillars of Hercules),\nwhich he set up on his way to Erytheia at the frontiers of\nEurope and Libya, points to the existence of a primitive pillar-\ncult of Heracles.\nNone of the ingenious people who mythologise mythology\nhas, so far as I know, claimed Heracles as a |)illar-god ;\nbut he\nseems to possess as good a title to the dignity as plenty of\nother deities; and the scribe may, I suggest, have been putting\nin a claim for him.\nBut, it may be objected, though Prometheus is alluded to\nin the script of March 4, there is no allusion in either script\nto Atlas. That is true, but in the Phercules Parens (11. 403-7),\nto which play both scripts plainly refer, the Chorus, just after\nmentioning the slaying of Geryon, speaks of Heracles\u2019 exploit\n\u201c when he came to the home of Atlas, and, for valour\u2019s sake,\nheld up the god\u2019s star-visaged mansions \u201d.\nIn Ijoth scripts it is clear that the scribe means that there\nis some point in the Hercales Parens that the commentators\nhave missed; and that this point has to do with the incident\nof the binding to the pillar, and is also in some way mixed\nup with the East and West: \u201cThe Club and Ke}'\u2014East and\nWest look for the Eastern sign of the Club ex pede Herculem.\nThe Hercules story comes in there and the clue is in the\n1 Since writing the above I hnd that Raoul Rochette suggested that Heracles\nwas worshipped under the form of a pillar ; hut his suggestion seems to have\nbeen ignored by archaeologists of the present daj'.\n\f259\nLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nEuripides play if you could only see it. Bound to the pillar\n\u2014\nI told you before of Sebastian, it is the same story of the\narcher and the binding to the pillar.\u201d\nBut the question now arises : why is Sebastian introduced ?\nSt. Sebastian is represented in mediaeval art as bound either\nto a pillar, a column or a tree. Mantegna\u2019s picture of his\nmartyrdom in the Vienna Gallery portrays him bound to a\npillar near a ruined triumphal arch ;\nand in other pictures\n(e.g. Pinturicchio\u2019s S. Sehastiano in the Vatican) ruined\narches oi\u2018 temples appear also ;\nand it has been suggested that\nthe ruined arches symbolise the destruction of the heathen\nI\nlowers. (See Mrs Jamieson\u2019s Sacred and Legendary Art,\np. 416.) He is almost, though not quite, invariably represented\nas pierced by arrows.\nThe piillar, which Heracles in his madness fell against and broke\nand to which he was bound, and his arrows, might readily\nenough suggest the pillar the broken arches and the arrows\nassociated with St. Sebastian ;\nand the pillar-god the pillar-saint.\nBut if \u201cclaviger\u201d was meant as an allusion to St. Peter as\nwell as to Heracles and Janus, there may well have been\nanother reason for the mention of St. Sebastian and of his\nbeing bound to a pillar ;\nfor tradition says that St. Peter was\nchained for nine months to a pillar in the Mamertine prison.\nAnd another reason why the thought of one saint might suggest\nthe other lies in the fact that the body of St. Peter was on\ntwo separate occasions removed from its original tomb on the\nVatican to the catacombs of St. Sebastian.\nI turn now to the remaining paragraphs of the script of\nMarch 25.\nThey contain, as has already been pointed out (v. pp. 223-5),\nvarious words or expressions-\u2014shadow, shadows, umbrae, animae,\nshadow of a shade, umbrarum umbras, (TKtd^ e\u2019lSwXop\u2014which\nall more or less suggest the idea of ghosts or spirits ;\nand also\na clear intimation that \u201cshadow\u201d is the subject of a cross-\ncorrespondence experiment.

For comments on the Latin\nwords the I\u2019eader is referred to pp. 225-6.\nMrs Verrali\u2019s script of March 25 had contained the words:\n\u201c let Piddington know when you get a message about\nshadow \u201d, a clear indication that \u201c shadow \u201d was the subject\nof a cross-coi\u2019respondence. This script of Mrs Holland\u2019s,\nwritten two days later, contained the word \u201c shadow\n\u201d\ntwice, and also tenehrae. The cross-correspondence involved in\nthese coincidences I have dealt with in Section XVII pp. 225-7.\nThe \u201cshadow\u201d of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script I have connected for\nreasons given above with the etSwXop or shade of Heracles in\nthe underworld.\nNow here in this script of Mi\u2019s Holland\u2019s, which contains a\nci\u2019oss-correspondence with Mrs Verrall\u2019s \u201c sliadow,\u201d occurs a\nreference to Tenny.son\u2019s Matul: \u201cBirds in the high Hall\nGarden\u201d: followed by the curious phrase: \u201cNot Maud Sylvia\u201d.\nThe name Sylvia, as will appear later (v. pp. 275 and 278),\nlinks this script of Mrs Holland\u2019s on to another script of hers\ncontaining an unmistakable reference to Browning\u2019s HeraMes-\n\u2014\ni.e. his verse-ti-anslation of the Hercules Furens. Hence both\nMrs Holland\u2019s and Mrs Verrah\u2019s \u201c shadow \u201d scripts are connected\nwith Heracles.\nVIII.\nThe next link in the chain is formed by Mrs Verrall\u2019s script\nof April 3 (v. p. 227-8).\nThe whole script I take to be expressive of the idea \u201cAngel\u201d\nor \u201c Angels \u201d, and to constitute a cross-correspondence with the\nword \u201c Angel \u201d given in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance of April 8.\nBut it corresponds also with Mrs Holland\u2019s script of April 8\n(quoted on p. 265), and corresponds in more than one respect.\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script contains the word \u201c Paradise \u201d written in\nprominent characters ;\nand Mrs Holland\u2019s the word \u201c Paradise \u201d.\nThis was the only occurrence of the word \u201cParadise\u201d in Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s script between November 16, 1906 and May 13, 1907 ;\nand the only occurrence of the word \u201c Paradiso \u201d in Mrs\nHolland\u2019s between November 21, 1906 and July 10, 1907.\nBut the coincidence was not merely a verbal one, for Mrs\n\f\u2022263\nLvii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nVerrall, who knew nothing of Mrs Holland\u2019s script of\nApril 8, on April 28, 1907 noted in her diaiy (v. p. 264)\nthat her script of April 3 was probably \u201c a preliminary\nattempt at Dante\u2019s Paradiso This script might at first sight\nappear to suggest Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost or Paradise\nRegained or both rather than Dante\u2019s Paradiso. But if the\nreader will refer to the script he will see that the scribe\ntlu\u2019oughout expresses dissatisfaction at what has been written\nuntil the figure of an angel is drawn :\n\u201c No, not quite\nthat\u201d\u2014\u201cflaming swords\u201d\u2014\u201cno\u201d \u2014\u201cyou keep going round the\nideas instead of giving three plain words\u201d\u2014\u201cOf man\u2019s first\nDisobedience. No, that is something else\u201d\n\u2014\u201cNo, I can\u2019t get\nit at all. Leave it today\n\u2014\u201d.\n\u201cOf man\u2019s first disobedience\u201d is the first line of Milton\u2019s\nParadise Lost, and the scribe says plaiidy that that is not\nthe idea which he is trying to express. Mrs Verrall, there-\nfore, was fully justified in not regarding Paraxlise Lost as\nthe subject of her script of April 3. While Mrs Verrall,\nthen, interprets the script of April 3 as a probable first\nattempt at Dante\u2019s Paradiso, Mrs Holland\u2019s script contains\nthe word \u201c Paradiso \u201d. But the coincidence extends somewhat\nfurther, for Mrs Holland\u2019s script contains besides the word\n\u201cParadiso\u201d a latent allusion to Canto XSVII of the Purgatorio;\nand in this Canto an Angel bids Dante go forward through\nthe fire which leads to the terrestrial Paradise (v. p. 267).\nIX.\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script of April 6, 1907 contributes the next\ntopic or rather two topics. In Section XVIII this script of April\n6 was treated as constituting a cross-coi'respondence with the\nwords \u201c O\u2019er mountains, seas and lakes and rivers \u201d, uttered in\nMrs Piper\u2019s trance. These words were seemingly connected\nin the trance with Wordsworth\u2019s poem \u201c I wandered lonely as\na Cloud\u201d, and they also seemed to be reminiscent of a poem\nby F. W. H. Myei\u2019S, the scenery of which is the Lake District\nor W^ordsworth Country ;\nand for this reason I took i\\Irs\nVerrall\u2019s script of April 6, \u201cI wandered lonely as a Cloud\u201d\nand \u201c O\u2019er mountains, seas and lakes and rivers\u201d to be all three\n\f264 J.

[part\nvarious ways of expressing one idea, namely, the Wordsworth\nCountry.\nMrs Verrall, however, had placed another interpretation on\nher script of April 6, as the following copy of an entry made\nin her diary on April 28 shows :\nFinal verifying of references shows me that mysc.[ript] of Ap. 6 was\nan attempt to say Lethe, with a distinct reference [i.e. \u201c the storied\nmount \u201d] to Dante\u2019s Purgatorio, which I have read and must be taken\nto know. Probabl}\" the sc.[ript] of Ap. 3 [v. pp. 227-8] is a\npreliminary attempt at Dante\u2019s Paradiso, but at the time I did\nnot see it. I wonder if there has been any Dante in the P.[iper]\ntrance, or if I shall get it tomorrow.\nWith this interpretation I agree ;\nbut because I now hold\nthat the script of April 6 may allude to the Mount of Purgatory\nand the River of Lethe, I do not the less hold that, as suggested\nabove (p. 238), it also corresponds to \u201c O\u2019er mountains, seas\nand lakes and rivers\u201d and \u201cI wandered lonely as a Cloud that\nboats on high o\u2019er hill and dale\u201d. That two diberent ideas\nshould be implicit in a single scri|)t of an apparently homo-\ngeneous character\u2014that, in other words, a script sliould ])ossess\na double reference will not, I hope, seem to be an improbable\nhypothesis; and in any case the fact must not be over-\nlooked that, when Mrs Verrall arrived at her interjjretation\nand I at mine, neither of us had the faintest conception of\nthe existence of a complicated series of inter-related subjects\nlatent in the automatic writings or speech of Mrs Holland,\nMrs Piper and Mrs Verrall, into which both Wordsworth\u2019s\nCountry and the Mountain of Purgatory and River of Lethe\nwould bt.\nX.\nOn April 8, within an interval of 9 hours, three concordant\ncontributions to the concatenation of ideas were made, one in\nMrs Holland\u2019s script, one in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance, and one in\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script.

The realisation of this identification was attainable\nonly in that state of ecstasy in which the individual soul\nentered into communion with the Divine; and for the attain-\nment of this state of ecstasy \u201c a cloudless sky \u201d was one of\nthe desirable conditions.\nThe context of Mrs Holland s script shows a connection, as\ndoes the context of \u201cLight in West\u201d, between the identification\nof East and West and one of the associations which IMyersp said\nauTOf ovpavog (XKvpwv had for him ;\nfor \u201c Do you remember that\nexquisite sky when the afterglow made the East as beautiful\nand as richly coloured as the West\u201d is preceded by a reference\nto Dante\u2019s Paradiso, and Myersp associated Dante with avrog\novpavog uKvp-wv (v. p. 131-G).\nPteference to p. 261 will show that Mrs Holland\u2019s script of\nMarch 27, like Mrs Verrall\u2019s of April 8, alludes to Tennyson\u2019s\nMaud. The former has :\n\u201c Birds in the high Hall Garden \u201d,\nand the latter ;\n\u201c The words w^ere from Maud \u201d. This is a\nplain enough cross-correspondence. But I believe that Mrs\nHolland\u2019s script of April 8 also contains an allusion to Tennyson\u2019s\nMaiul in the words \u201c The constellation of Orion \u201d. Twice and\ntwice only is Orion mentioned in Maud, and each time in\nconnection with his setting in the We.st, and also (though\nthis does not concern us for the moment) with daffodils: \u2014\n\u201c till I could bear it no more.\nBut arose, and all by myself in my own dark garden ground.\ns\n\f274 J.

One of the topics of Mrs\nHolland\u2019s script of April 8 is beyond question the identification\nof East and West; and on the same day a few hours later\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script misquotes a line belonging to a context\nin Maud where the East and West are identified. Con-\nsequently Mrs Verrall\u2019s and Mrs Holland\u2019s minds were (no\nmatter how or why) each impressed at this period with the\nsame two ideas : the identification of East and West and\nTennyson\u2019s Maud. Both these ideas emerged in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\ncase in the form of a quotation from Maud and in that\nform only. !Mrs Holland\u2019s quotation from Maud had nothing\nto do with the identification of East and West, but the\npassage in her script which did give expression to this\n\f275\nLVH.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nidea was immediately preceded by the name of a constellation\nwhich is twice mentioned in Maud in connection with the\nWest.\nOnce more. An idea closely allied to that of the identification\nof East and West had been expressed in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of\nMarch 2.5 in the form of a reference to Heracles as a type of\nthe union of the Eastern and the Western worlds ;\nand this\nscript contains a direct allusion to the Hercides Furens of\nEuripides and to the e\u2019\/dcoAor, or shade of Heracles. Mrs\nHolland\u2019s script of March 27 opened with a quotation from\nMaud followed by the words \u201cNot Maud Sylvia\u201d; and then\nwent on to refer to \u201c shadow \u201d. This reference to \u201c shadow\n\u201d\nI take, for reasons already explained, to be the counterpart of\n'\\Irs Verrall\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d and \u201cshade\u201d, which I connect with\nthe \u20aclSwKov of Heracles. Mrs Verrall, then, in one scidpt com-\nbines references to Heracles as symbolising the union of East\nand West, to \u201c shadow \u201d and to the Hercides Furens, and\nin another script to Maud and the idetitification of East and\nWest ;\nwhile Mrs Holland in one script combines allusions to\nMaud and \u201cshadow\u201d, and, if my interpretation of \u201c the con-\nstellation of Orion \u201d be admitted, in another script to the\nidentification of East and West and to Maud. Moreover, for\nreasons to be explained later (p. 278), the phrase \u201c not Maud\nSylvia\u201d pi'obably indicates that Mrs Holland\u2019s script of March 27\nis to be combined with her script of April 16, which contains\nan unmistakable reference to Browning\u2019s translation of the\nNereides Furens.\n\u201c But still \u201d, a critic might sa}^ \u201c if you hadn\u2019t got into your\nhead this theory about the subjects of cross-correspondences\nforming a connected chain of ideas, you never would have\nthought of seeing in \u201c the constellation of Orion \u201d an allusion\nto Tennyson\u2019s Maud \u201d. To this imaginary but probable criticism\nI can reply that before I entertained the very faintest suspicion\nuf the existence of any such concatenation of ideas I had\ntaken \u201c the constellation of Orion \u201d to be an allusion to Maud.\nI began by putting together the two scripts of April 8 and\nMrs Piper\u2019s \u201cLight in West\u201d, and regarded them as all allud-\ning specially to the union of East and West, and generally\nto the identification of opposites ;\nand I treated them in the\n\f27(3 [part\n.\/. 0. Picldington.\noriginal draft of this section as constituting a triple cross-\ncorrespondence, of a complex type indeed, but complete in\nitself and unconnected witli any other cross-correspondence.\nThis original draft was read by Mrs Verrall, Miss Johnson and\nMr G. W. Balfour, who, I do not doubt, would, if necessary,\nverify my statement that in it I interpreted \u201c the constellation\nof Orion \u201d as an allusion to Maud.\nIt is important to establish the point that my interpretation\nof \u201c the constellation of Orion \u201d as an allusion to the two\n\u201c Orion \u201d passages in Maud quoted above was derived solely\nfrom a collation of the two scripts of April 8, and was made\nand committed to wilting before I originated the theory as\nto the inter-relation of several of the cross-correspondences,\nbecause in view of the use I am going to make of these\ntwo \u201c Orion \u201d passages it might look as if I had dragged in\nthis interpretation simply in order to supply two links in\nthe concatenation of ideas which would otherwise have been\nmissino-.\nO\nWhat, then, are these missing links supplied by the two\n\u201c(Jrion\u201d passages in Maud'l Before answering this question,\nI will first remind the reader of two of the subjects which,\naccording to my theory, must have been occupying the mind\nof the directing intelligence who was distributing among\nthe various automatists a series of ideas capable of being con-\nsolidated into a coherent body.\nThese two subjects were the Daffodils celebrated by Wordsworth\nin the poem \u201c I wandered lonel}^ as a Cloud\u201d (quoted in the trance\nby Myersp on March 20), and Cytherea, the planet of love, \u201cwho\nseemeth ever burning with fire of love\u201d, and \u201cwho was first\nbeaming from the east on the mount \u201d of Purgatory, when Dante\nhad his vision of Leah and Rachel. Now this same dii'ecting\nintelligence whose thoughts were, ex hy-pothesi, occupied with\nthese two subjects had made refei'ences in Mrs Holland\u2019s script\nto Maud in her garden (March 27) and to Orion, whose setting\nin the West at the time of the year when the daffodAl dies\nis twice mentioned in Maud. Now we find these three subjects\nin some sense united in that famous passage in Maud where\nthe lover, waiting for Maud in the high Hall-garden, sees just\nbefore the dawn (as did the lover Dante waiting on the Mount\n\f277\nLvii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nof Purgatory to begiu the ascent that is to bring him finally\nto Beatrice) the planet of Love :\n\u201c For a breeze of morning moves,\nAnd the planet of Love is on high\nBeginning to faint in the light that she loves\nOn a bed of daffodil sky.\u201d\nThis passage in Maud by means of the \u201c planet of Love\n\u201d\nlinks up the subjects connected with Purgatorio, Cantos XXVII\nand XXVIII, with the subjects connected with Tennyson\u2019s Maud ;\nand by means of the word \u201cdaffodil\u201d the subjects connected\nwith Maud with the subjects connected with Wordsworth.\nBut how is it that so important a link did not appear in\nthe scripts or in the trance ?\nObviously the directing intelligence may have tried to insert\nthis link, and have failed to do so ;\nor,\u2014and this is the\nexplanation which recommends itself to me\u2014a gap may have\npurposely been left for someone not concerned in the produc-\ntion of the phenomena to fill in, so as to make the case as\ndifficult a one as possible to account for by telepathy between\nthe automatists.\nXI.\nIf the reader will consult the extracts from the sittings of\nApril 15, April 17, April 23, April 24, April 29, May 1, May 7,\nMay 19, and June 2, given in Section XVIII, he will see, fii\u2019st,\nthat on April 15 \u201cMountain\u201d was first mentioned as the subject\nof a cross-corresponding message intended for Mrs Verrall\n;\nsecondly, that on April 17 the words \u201cO\u2019er mountains, seas\nand lakes and rivers \u201d were uttered in the wakino'-stao-e amono-\nO & O\nother cross-corresponding messages ;\nand thirdly, that on\nsubsecjuent dates \u201c Mountain \u201d was mentioned in close connec-\ntion with \u201c lake\n\u201d \u201c cloud \u201d and \u201c lonely I consider that these\nfacts indicate that though \u201c Mountain \u201d was the subject of a\nseparate cross-correspondence experiment, it was connected in\nthe mind of the trance-personality both with \u201c O\u2019er mountains,\nseas and lakes and rivei's \u201d and with \u201c I wandered lonely as a\nCloud \u201d.\n\f278 G.

Once and once only was the name Harold\nwritten in Mrs Piper\u2019s script, and once and once only were\nthe names Leopold and Sylvia written in Mrs Holland\u2019s\nscript during the period under review. This apparently\nirrelevant affixing of the names of Frederic Myers\u2019s three\nchildren to three different pieces of script was, I consider,\ndone in order to show that the subjects of the three scripts\nformed part of one family of ideas, and were meant to be\npieced together ; a clue that was badly needed since between\nthe quotation from Maud and the two allusions to Euripides\nthere most certainly did not exist any obvious connection.\nXIII.\nThe sitting of April 29 was attended by Mrs Verrall.

But a cautious use\nmust be made of them, for no tabular statement can contain\nthose nuances and qualifications, without which accounts of\npsychological phenomena must be misleading. Thus, the\nvarious inter-connected subjects are arranged in the diagram\nin a purely arbitrary order, and might be re-arranged in half\na dozen different wa}\u2019s; and in Tables I and III it has\nbeen specially difficult to decide which subjects to class as\n\u2018\nimplicit \u2019\nand which as \u2018\nexplicit \u2019.\nThe scheme of the diagram is as follows :\n\u2014\nThe headings of the circles, printed in red ink, indicate the\nparent topics from which subordinate topics, printed in black\nink, have been derived. One of these subordinate topics in\nits turn becomes, as represented in the next circle, the parent\nof a new topic, and so on. At certain points, shown by the\nconnective arrow-heads, the same topic has been derived\nthrough two different parents: e.g. Geryon through the\nInferno and Purgatorio in the one case, and through Hercules\nin the other.\n\f\"O'er\niiioumains.\nlakes\nA-\nriv.-rs\nWordsworth\nCountry\n\fi\n-^Cv\n\fTable I. \u2014showing how and on what Dates the vakious Topics were distributed among the Automatists.\nExp. = Explicit in the Script or Trance-Speech of; Dip. = Implicit in the Script or Trance-Speech of.\nMrs. Piter.

It is found on three\nother occasions only'; on March 18, in the phrase: \u201cThe\nm emory of it is like a great black shadow that blots out\nhalf the sky'\u201d; and on Apiril 1, in a phrase which I will\nquote and discuss prresently\" ;\nand on April 8, in a context\na 1 ready quoted (v. p. 265).\n\f291\nLvii.] Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nThe only time that the word is written twice in the same\nsciipt is on April 24.\n\u201c Horizon \u201d occurs here and here only in Mrs Holland\u2019s\nscript dining\u2019 the period under review, that is on Wednesday\nf\nApril 24 ;\nnine days after the only occurrence of the word in\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script, which contained the ]ihrase \u201c I will give\nit elsewhere\nThe opening words of the following paragraph of Mrs\nHolland\u2019s script of April 1 do correspond very closely indeed\nwith \u201ca cloudless sky beyond the horizon\u201d and \u201cazure\u2014it\nmeans blue \u201d :\n\u2014\nThe sk}\u2019 is fiercely blue with not a single cloud in\nsight\u2014 The birds are sheltering from the noonday heat.\nIn England this will be a comparatively mild month\n\u2014\nbut May will be cruelly cold with frequent snow flurries\nand the effect on the fruit trees will be disastrous\n\u2014\nIf this is taken to represent \u201cazure\u201d and \u201ca cloudless sky\nbeyond the horizon \u201d then \u201cthe message did not come first\u201d to\nMrs Verrall ;\nand the forecast of what the weather was to be\nin England during April and l\\Iay must be regarded as a mere\nexcrescence. \\Yeather forecasts of the kind and references to\nweather conditions are not infrequent in Mrs Holland\u2019s script;\nbut whether they are inspired by the scribe or owe their\nemergence to interest in things meteorological felt by Mrs\nHolland it is impossible to decide ;\nbut with some of them at\nleast Myersn is connected, (v. Proc. Part LY. pp. 291-2, 295.)\nIt is possible that the phrase \u201cthe sk}^ is fiercely blue with\nnot a single cloud in sight\u201d may be a reflection not of the\ncross-correspondence message announced in the trance of\nApril 17, but of the paraphrase of the words auro? ovpuvo^\nuKviJ-oDv, \u201ccloudless sky beyond the horizon\u201d, given in the trance\nof March 6 by Myersp ;\nbut the occurrence of the \\vord \u201c blue\n\u201d\nin it suggests rather that it I\u2019epresents not the original\nparaphrase of anrb? ovpavo^ aKvpwv, but the first emergence of\nthe cross-correspondence message which was formed out of it\nbv tacking on the words \u201cazure\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d.\n^ For the significance of this day of the week see pp. \u2018206 and 2\u201825, and\nProc.

Myers said\na cloud]e.ss .sky beyond the horizon\u201d as the first announce-\nment of \u201cHorizon\u201d as the subject of a cross-correspondence\nexperiment, or as a way of ascertaining whether the ]mra-\nphrase of avrog ovpupo? ukv\/uloop given in the trance of March 6\nhad been correctly registered through Mrs Pipei', and whether\nthe point of it had been grasped by the experimenters.\nMrs Sidgwick naturally took the words in the second\nsense ;\nand one would not have thought of looking for any\nother significance in them had it not been for the fact that\nthe extracts from the sittings of A]nil 17, 24 and 29 quoted\nabove make it pei fectly clear that the word \u201c Horizon \u201d formed\npart of a cross-correspondence message. There can be no\ndoubt that the choice of \u201cHorizon\u201d and \u201cazure\u201d as subjects\nfor a cross-corresponding message was suggested by atlrb?\noupavog aKupow and by the paraphrase of these words given\nin the trance of March 6. The choice may seem an unwise\none, but 1 may remark that I had myself long before chosen\n\u201cPearls before swine\u201d as a message for transmission by the\nPiper controls to Mrs Verrall, although these words had been\ntwice previously given or alluded to in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script\n;\nand I did this purposely, as I thought it would be interesting\nif Mrs Verrall\u2019s script should lepeat the words a third time\nafter her normal consciousness had been on two previous\noccasions preoccupied with them. I am sufficiently convinced\nof the intellio\u2019ence, if not of the identities, of the trance-\npersonalities who call themselves Myers and Hodgson, to\nbelieve that some such idea may have prompted their choice\nof \u201c Horizon \u201d for the purpose of a similar experiment.\nOn April 17 Myersp said he believed that \u201c Azure \u201d, meaning\nblue, \u201ccame out with a star being di-awn also horizon which\ncomes from the poem \u201d. No star a|)|)eared in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscrii)t of April 15 ;\nbut if the reader will turn to p. 114 he\nwill see that in her script of February 26, the only script\nof Mrs Verrall\u2019s which contains the words aero? oeparo?\nuKvp.wi>, occurs also the phrase :\n\u201c I think I have got some\nwords from the poem written down\u2014if not stars and satellites\nanother phrase will do as well \u201d. When MyerSp spoke ol a\n\fLVII.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 293\nstar being drawn and of \u201chorizon\u201d coming from the poem,\nMrs Sidgwick thinking he was referring to the star of\n\u201cHope, Star and Browning\u201d asked if by the poem lie meant\nBiowning\u2019s poem. Myersp acquiesced, but I cannot help\nthinking that the acquiescence was of a kind commonly\ndisplajmd by trance-|)ersonalities, who unfortunately are often\nonly too ready to accept any suggestion that mav be\noffered. I believe that the trance-personalities, though they\ndid intend to connect \u201c Hope, Star and Bi'owning \u201d with\n\u201c Horizon \u201d in a general wajq did not mean that \u201c Horizon\n\u201d\nformed part of the particular message given to Mrs Verrall\nwhich they always de.scribed as \u201c Hope, Star and Browning \u201d\n;\nand that in spite of some confusion and ambiguit}^ they finally\nsucceeded more or less clearly in retracting the statement\nhere made. I will later on explain how I arrive at this\nconclusion; but meanwhile let us accept the statement that\nthere was some connection between \u201cstar\u201d, \u201chorizon\u201d and a\npoem of Browning\u2019s; and see if there is anything which can\nhe said to represent this combination of ideas in Mrs Verrall\u2019,\ns\nsci'ipt.\nIn her script of February 26, in addition to cu\/to? oupo.vo<i\naKufxwv, \u201c stars and satellites \u201d and a quotation from Grossimj\nthe Bar, come the words :\n\u201c The last poems of Tennyson and\nBrowning should be compared\u201d. There are, therefore, combined\nin this script references to aaro? oaparo? dKVfxm>, which answers\nto \u201c Horizon \u201d \u201c a cloudless sky beyond the horizon \u201d\n;\nto\n\u201c stars and satellites \u201d, which answers to \u201c star \u201d\n;\nand a\nmention of the last poems of Browning, which answers to\n\u201c Browning\u2019s poem \u201d. The coincidences are there ;\nand though\nI do not claim them as supernormally produced, still thev\nshould not be overlooked.\nImmediately after Myersp on April 17 had said that by\n\u201cthe poem\u201d he meant Browning\u2019s poem he added spon-\ntaneously: \u201cI wrote myself a similar line which I gave her\n[i.e. Mrs Verrall] also\u201d. This may be intended for an allusion\nto Myers\u2019s poem on Tennyson, the motto of which is aura?\novpav'o's uKupoov, and which contains a phrase, \u201c These wavele.ss\nheights of evening\u201d, obviously reminiscent of the words of\nPlotinus. It also contains the words \u201c0 star and planet\u201d.\n\f[part\n29-i G. Piddington.\nNow \u201cstars and satellites\u201d in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of February\n26 was a phi-ase which she knew norinally had been men-\ntioned in a Piper sitting, that of January 30, and she had\nnoted in her diary on February 2, 1907 that it had reminded\nher of \u201c0 star and ])lanet\u201d in Myers\u2019s poem on Tennyson.\nThis interpretation would make another coincidence of a sort\nbetween what was s;dd by MyerSp at the sitting of April 17\nand Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of February 26. Uf course this is\nall exceedingly confused and ambiguous and hypothetical ;\nyet\nI feel that it is rather difficult to set down this stidngf of\ncoincidences to chance alone. Some may think it altogether\ntoo fanciful even tentatively to interpret \u201c I wrote myself\na similar line \u201d as a reference to Myers\u2019s poem on Tennyson.\nThe interpretation is certainly unverihable, but I think one\nmay justifiably conjecture that a trance-personality, who showed\nhe knew as much about uvto? ovpuvog aKufjLwu as MyeiSp did,\npossessed a little more knowledge on the subject than he\nsucceeded in explicitly displaying.\nI said above that my view is that the trance-personalities\ndid not intend to state that \u201c Horizon \u201d formed part of the\nmessage written by Mrs Verrall on January 28 which is\nalways described by the Piper trance-personalities as \u201c Hope,\nStar and Browning \u201d.\nM^hat I do think that they may have meant to say was that\nwhen they gave Mrs Verrall \u201cHorizon\u201d and \u201cAzure\u201d they\ngave at the same time a star. It was the question asked\nby Mrs Sidgwick on April 17\u2014\u201c Browning\u2019s poem you\nmean?\u201d\u2014which, in my view, introduced the subsequent\nconfusion with \u201c Hope, Star and Browning \u201d. The statements\nmade by Myersp on April 15 in reply to Mrs Sidg wick\u2019s\nquestion \u201c why he chose that sentence about horizon,\u201d I take\nto mean one or both of two things : (1) that the Latin\nMessage (v. pp. 312-14) had suggested to him the plan of\nanswering the question about uvto? ovpavo^ aKupwv by means\nof concordant messages given to Mrs Verrall and Mrs Piper;\n(2) that the Latin Message had suggested to him the plan\nof using the phrase \u201c Cloudless sky beyond the horizon \u201d not\nonly as a paraphrase of avTO? ovpavo<; uKup-wv but also as a\ncross-correspondence message.\n\flvil] 295\n^\u20221 Sei'ies of Concordant Automatisms.\nI regal\u2019d the phrase in the sitting of April 24; \u201cHorizon\ncomes elsewhere. Do not get confused, dear Mrs Sidgwick \u201d :\nas an attempt on the part of the trance-personalities to\nexplain that a mistake had been made in conveying the\nimpression that \u201c Horizon \u201d formed a part of the \u201c Hope, Star\nand Browning\u201d cross-correspondence. They made Mrs Sidgwick\nwholly responsible for the confusion ;\napparently unmindful of\nthe fact that, even if Mrs Sidgwick may have inadvertently\nstarted it, they themselves not only had hitherto done\nnothing to remove it, but had on the contrary accentuated it.\nIn conclusion, I would advise the reader who has no taste\nfor these subtleties and entanglements to dismiss them from\nhis mind, and to pay attention only to the comparatively\nstraightforward case of cross-correspondence exemplified in the\nquotations from Mrs Piper\u2019s trance of April 17, from Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s script of April 15, and fi'om Mrs Holland\u2019s script\nof April 24.\nXXL\n\u201c THANATOS.\u201d\nExtract from rccordj of icords spoken in the waking-stage of\nMrs Pipers trance of April 17, 1907.\n(Present: Mrs. Sidgwick and Miss Newton)\nVery sorry right (?) \u2014Eector.\nPake very slow, [\u201cspeak very slow\u201d was meant.]\nHallo.

They occurred\nin t\u2019ne middle of a series of sentences not explicitly a,ttributed\nto Myersp, but indubitably to be attributed to him. In the\nrecord a cpiery was put against \u201cThanatos\u201d as the word\nw'as not quite certain.\n\u201cThanatos\u201d is a Greek word meaning \u201cDeath\u201d.\nThe word, or an approximation to it, was given four times\nin all, each time in a disconnected way, and each time in the\nmiddle of words or phrases which without any hesitation may\nbe attributed to Myersp or Hodgsoup.\nIt was twice given quite clearly, namely on April 23 and 30,\nthe recorder being in one instance Mrs feidgwick and in the\nother Miss Johnson, neither of whom had any reason for\nsupposing that there was any particular significance in the\nword.\nIn view of the subsequent emergence of \u201c riianatos it is\npractically certain that the words in the waking-stage of\nApril 17 recorded as \u201c Sanatos \u201d and \u201c Tanatos \u201d represent\nmishearing's or mispronunciations of \u201c Ihanatos . \u201cSanatos\nand \u201cTanatos\u201d, it should be observed, were closely followed\non April 17 by the words :\n\u201c O\u2019er mountains seas and lakes\nand rivers\u201d: which, as we have already seen (v. p. 277),\nwere a variant of a cross-correspondence message which Myersp\nsaid he had given to Mrs Vei-rall.\nOn the assumption that \u201c Sanatos \u201d and \u201c Tanatos \u201d repi'e-\nsent the first emergence of \u201c Thanatos \u201d and that \u201c Thanatos\nwas the subject of a cross-correspondence experiment, it now^\nremains to find the tally. A first tally I find in Mrs Holland\u2019s\nscript of April 16, of which part has already been cited\n(v. p. 278), and of which I will now give a copy of the ojiening\nparagraphs :\n\u2014\nMaurice.

The object of this introduction of\nthe Eno'lish word \u201cdeath\u201d seems to me to have been not so\nmuch to supply a translation as to indicate that \u201cMors\u201d was\nthe only significant word of the three words written on the\nfii'St line.\nThe word \u201c Thanatos \u201d was cleaily pronounced on two\noccasions by Mrs Piper during the waking-stage, first on\nApril 23, and again on April 30. One may suppose that on\nApril 23 the word was uttered to explain the misheard or\nmispronounced * Sanatos \u201d and \u201c Tanatos \u201d of April 17 ;\nthe\nsecond and double repetition of the word on April 30 would\nliave seemed superfluous had it not been that Mrs Verrall,\nwho attended a sitting with Mrs Piper on that day, had\nwritten on April 29 a piece of script containing four quota-\n\f299\nLVii.] Series of Concordant Automatisms.\ntions all involving the notion of Death.

Neither the script nor the note could\nhave been seen by Mrs Piper.\nThe first two lines are quoted from a motto ])refixed by\nW. S.

Mrs Verrall subse-\nquently explained to me how it came about that Delta\nsuggested Death to her. She wrote ;\n\u201cI had at the time [i.e. when the script was produced] a strong\nimpression that, long before I knew any classics, someone had told\nme that a Greek capital A was engraved on the voting tablets used to\ncondemn. I believe this to be a mistake due to a confusion between\n(a) the Roman use of D in such a case, and (b) the Greek word\nfor a tablet, SeAros [so called from the original Delta-like shape].\nBut I do not think the confusion is mine, Anyhow on\nApril 30 I took A to mean Death, and Nile to be an explanation\nof the first A.\u201d\nManibus date lilia 'plenis is a quotation from the famous\npassage in the sixth book of the Aeneid where Anchises\nforetells the early death of Marcellus, the nephew of Augustus,\nand in dramatic anticipation calls for lilies and bright flowers\nto strew on the corpse.\nMrs Verrall traced no significance in \u201cDaisy\u201d. Two possible\ninterpretations, of which I think the second the more likel,y,\nhave occurred to me :\n(1) \u201cThere is a popular superstition that if you omit to\nput your foot on the first Daisy you see in Spring, Daisies\nwill grow over you or some one dear to you ere the year\nbe out.\u201d Richard Folkard, Plant Lore, p. 308.\n(2) The Vergiliau quotation and its context:\n\u201c Tu Marcellus eris.

It will be noticed that\nthe novelist calls the ace of spades \u2018\nthe sign of deatli \u2019, and\nif the drawing in the script was intended to represent the\nace of clubs, one may suppose that the word \u201csign\u201d which\nfollowed the drawing was due to a confused recollection of\nthe title given to the ace of spades in the story.\nI cannot inqirove on this explanation, but it would be more\nconvincing if the drawing was not more like a flower of some\nkind than an ace of clubs.\nOn April 28, the day before the script was written, Mrs\nVerrall had come across Dante\u2019s translation of \u201c manibus date\nlilia jilenis\u201d in Pu'rgatorio, Canto XXX.

Thus the first four woi'ds of\nthe familiar quotation, \u201cCome away, come away Death\u201d, are\nwritten, but not the fifth and most essential ;\nand the nearest\na])proach made is when the Latin for death is written.\nOn the morning of April 29 Mi\u2019s Verrall had had a sitting\nwith Mrs Piper, and in the course of it Myersp told her to\nlook out for a word beginning with a D which he was trying\nto impress her with. Mrs Verrall replied that she thought\nshe had got the word, and told MyerSp what it was. He\n.said it was not right, and that she must go on trying to get\nthe word he wanted.\nThe word beginning with a D to which Myersp was alluding\nwas not the word \u201cDeath\u201d, but the word \u201cDwarf\u201d which\nweeks before I had asked Myersp to make Mi's Verrall write\n(v. ]). 87). The reference to it made in Mrs Verrall\u2019s presence\non April 29 was one out of thirty se])arate references made\nbetween Feb. 19 and May 27.

On Apihl 17,\nthe first occasion, that is, that Mrs Piper went into trance\nafter Mrs Holland\u2019s script was written, \u201c Sanatos \u201d and\n\u201cTanatos\u201d were uttered in the waking-stage. Then on A]>ril 23\nthe faulty pronunciations of April 17 are amended, and\n\u201cThanatos\u201d is successfully articulated. The word is not\nagain spoken until Apiil 30, the first occasion, that is, on\nwhich Mrs Piper was entranced after Mrs Verrall had written\non the night of April 29 a script which in vaiious ways\nrefers to death. The last utterance of the word was at the\nsitting on May 7, which Miss Johnson attended, and may\nperhaps have been then made in order to draw Miss Johnson\u2019s\nattention to it, she having just three days before received Mrs\nHolland\u2019s script of April 16.\nIt may be thought that the word \u201c Death \u201d was one very\nlikely indeed to occur in the trance-script or trance-speech of\nMrs Piper and in the scripts of Mis Holland and Mrs Ven-all.\nNo doubt the woi-d does occur in the case of Mrs Piper\noccasionally, though the trance-personalities have a strong and,\nas I think, silly objection to its use; but during the sittings\nheld in England it certainly did not occur as a single dis-\nconnected word or in such a context as to suggest that it w\u2019as\nthe important word of the sentence, except on the occasion\nunder discussion, and then only in a Greek form.\nI have already said that in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script the word\nappears only once.\nMrs Holland\u2019s script is voluminous, but I believe I am\naccurate in asserting that the word \u201cdeath\u201d occurred in it\nduring the period under review four times only: once on\nDec. 31, 1906 in a quotation, \u2018\u201cBodily death ensues when\nthe soul\u2019s attention is totally withdrawn from the organism\netc.\u201d\u2019; once, on Jan. 2, 1907, in the phrase: \u201cThe gold of the\n\f304 [part\nG.

(Mrs Yerrall\u2019s acquaintance with the\nrecords is with a few exceptions confined to the records\npublished in Proceedings.)

The strongest reason for regarding the coincidence as\naccidental is the long interval of time, just five months, which\nelapsed before the words written by Mrs Verrall were repro-\nduced in the trance. On the other hand it must not be\nforgotten that the coincidence is one of a series.\nXXIII.\n\u201c MUSIC\nThis case can be properly understood only if read in\nconnection with the \u201c Latin Message \u201d (v. pp. 312-416), which I\nshould accordingly advise the reader to study first. Here it\nwill be sufficient to explain that at the sitting with Mrs Piper\nheld on IMay 6, 1907 Myersp remarked to Mrs Sidgwick that\nhe had completed his answer to Mrs Verrall\u2019s question about\naJro? ovpavo? uKiijmcov, and that he believed that he had answered\nthe question put to him in the Latin Message \u201c through both\nlights sufficiently for jmu to understand that I have really\nanswered at last \u2019\u2019\n:\n\u201c both lights \u201d meaning Mrs Piper and Mrs\nVerrall. To this Mrs Sidgwick replied:\u2014\u201cThrough Mrs Verrall\nyou answered very clearly, and through this light you have\nsaid a good deal about Aht Vogler. But in Abt Vogler there\nis a particular line which specially answers the Latin message.\nThe Latin message, as you know, refers to cross-correspondences,\n\f308 J. G. Piddington.

No\ntrace of this message is to be found in any part of Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript, but read in connection with the statement made by\nMyersp on May 6,\n\u201c long ago I gave the word music \u201d, and\nwith the context in which these words appeared, the automatic\nwriting produced by Mrs Yerrall on Dec. 17, 1900 is certainly\nsuggestive.\nThis script was begun at 12 noon, that is, immediately\nafter the words Diversis internimtUs quod^ invicem inter se\nrespondentia jamdudum committis had been given to Rector\nfor transmission to Myersp ;\nand it read as follows :\n\u2014\nRevolving axes\nRevolving spheres the mystic music make\nRevolving spheres the harmony began\nHarmonious sound scarce audible to man\nThen from every several unit of the whole\nJoined the majestic music of the Soul\nno no\n\f.310 J.

W. H. Myers\u2019s.\nMrs Veriall\u2019s knowledge of the experiment described in the\nLatin Message may serve to explain the contents of her script\n-of Dec. 17 ;\nbut Mrs Piper did not shai'e Mrs Verrall\u2019s know-\nledge ;\nand even if she had, it would not account for her, in\ncommon with Mrs Verrall, hitting on \u201c Music \u201d as an appropriate\nanswer to the Latin Message, nor for the knowledge displayed\nin her trance of May 6 of the fact that \u201c long ago \u201d the word\nMusic\u201d had appeared in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script.\n\fTHE LATIN MESSAGE.\nBetween the scripts of Mrs Verrall and Mrs Holland, as\nreaders of Miss Johnson\u2019s paper ]jublished in Proc. Part LV.\nwill know, a good number of coincidences has been traced\nbefoi\u2019e the English sittings with Mrs Piper began. Much of\nboth these two scri|)ts purports to be inspired by a group\nof spirits, of whom \u201c Myers \u201d is the most prominent. In the\ncommunications which purported to be made through Mrs\nVerrall and Mrs Holland by this group Miss Johnson thought\nshe could detect evidence of an attempt to carry out a form\nof cross-correspondence more complex than that which consists\nin the production of the same word or phrase through two\nautomatists. This simple type of coincidence it is easy enough\nto explain as the result of telepathic interchange between the\nautomatists ;\nbut this theory seemed inadequate to cover some\nof the more complex forms of cross-correspondence inherent in\nMrs Verrall\u2019s and Mrs Holland\u2019s scripts, which appeared to\npoint to the action of some third mind.^\nAnd as we turned the problem over in our minds we\ncame to realise how cross-cori\u2019espondences might be so\nelaborated as to aftbrd almost conclusive proof of the inter-\nvention of a third mind, and strong evidence of the identity\nof this third mind.\nThese considerations suggested that when Mrs Piper, in\nwhose trance the same group of personalities tigures as in\nMrs Verrall\u2019s and Mrs Holland\u2019s scripts, came to England,\nthe development of elaborate and complex cross-correspondences\nshould be encouraged. With this end in view we drew up a\nshort message to be addressed to Myersp. 1\u2019he message was\n^ See especially Chapter VII. of Miss Johnson\u2019s paper.\n\f313\nPART lvil] a Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nfirst written in Euolish, and then translated into Latin.

Unum accesserit gratissimum nobis, si cum duobus\nquibusdam ea tradideris was given.\nOn Dec. 31 Rector immediatelv after the usual Rreetinos\nwrote: \u201cWe have in part U.D. and conveyed your me.ssage\nto your friend Myers and he is delighted to receive it so far\nas he has been able to receive it \u201d.\nShortly afterwards I spelt out inte7' quae nullus appareat\nnexus, postea quam primum rem.\nOn Jan. 2, 1907 Rector said; \u201cHodgson is helping Myers with\nhis translation\u201d; and a little later Mj\u2019ersp said; \u201cyour message\nhas impressed me veiy much and I shall gladly translate it\ninto English for you I remarked that I didn\u2019t want the\nLatin to be translated, but a message to be sent which would\nshow that the Latin had been understood.\nMyersp replied :\n\u201c I quite understand and I will certainly do\nso \u201d, and then asked for the rest of the message to be dictated.\nper terti'um uliquem ita pyerjicias, ut latens ilhul in priori-\nbus explicetur was accordingly spelt out. Whereupon Myersp\nsaid ;\n\u201c I may ask you before I reply to repeat one or more\nwords that I may be quite sure that I have understood it\nproperly\nIn the waking-stage, immediately after the utterance of a sen-\ntence which can be attributed to MyerSp only, came the words\n;\n\u201cUnited (?) we (?) stand (?) divided we fall. Stick to it\nand spite of awful United\u2014 You know.\u201d\nThe second utterance of \u201c united \u201d was quite clear, and as\n\u201c divided we fall \u201d had been also quite clearly pronounced,\nthere can be no reasonable doubt that the quotation \u201cUnited\nwe stand, divided we fall \u201d was intended.\u2019^ The phrase was\nnever stated to be the subject of a cross-correspondence, and\n' I leave the queries against the first three words only because they were\ninserted in the original record.\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. S17\nhas no relevance to anything said at the sitting, unless it be\nto the second sentence of the Latin Message, the concluding\nwords of which were dictated for the first time in the course\nof this sitting of Jan. 2.\n\u201cUnited we stand, divided we fall\u201d would be a most\napposite comment on the second sentence; so apposite, indeed,\nthat had it been definitely connected in the trance with the\nLatin Message I should without hesitation have considered\nO\nthat the trance-personalities had thereby given proof of having\ngrasped the general meaning of it. Just as Mrs Verrall\u2019s script\nof Dec. 17, written a few minutes after the first clause of\nthe first sentence had for the first time been dictated to the\ntrance-personalities, fonns an appropriate answer to this clause,\nso here the words spoken in the waking-stage\u2014\u201cUnited we\nstand, divided we fall\n\u201d\n\u2014form an equally appropriate answer\nto the second paragraph of the Latin Message, the dictation\nof which has been for the first time completed some 55 minutes\npreviously. The portion of the Latin Message first dictated on\nDec. 17 refers to the transmission to ditferent intermediaries\nof things which correspond (answer mutually) between them-\nselves : i.e. to cross-correspondences. The expression \u201c things\nwhich correspond mutually between themselves \u201d could be inter-\npreted so as to appl}^ either to complex cross-correspondences,\nor\u2014as it was really intended\u2014to the simpler forms of cross-\ncorrespondence, which consist in the reproduction through two\nor more automatists of the same word or words or of the same\nidea expressed in different phraseology. The leading thought\nexpressed in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of Dec. 17, namely, that of\nharmony or of a symphony resulting from the combination of\nsingle sounds would correspond to either interpretation of the\nfirst sentence of the Message J and this script of Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nfor reasons already explained (v. pp. 310-11) is undoubtedly\nin the style of Myersy.\n1 That an answer should have been given to the second half of the Latin\nMessage by Myersv before the words of it had been dictated to Myersp is not\nnecessarily inconsistent with the hyijothesis that the knowledge of what passes\nat the Piper sittings manifested by Myersv is acquired by this personality\nfrom Myersp ; because Myersp may on Dec. 17 (or, as the gist of the Latin\nMessage was known to myself and others before that date, even earlier) have\nacquired telepathicaUy knowledge of the whole Message.\n\f318 J. G. Fiddington. \\\n[part\nIn the second sentence of the Message, the dictation of\nwhich was for the first time completed on Jan. 2, the\nsuggestion is made that Myersp should carry out a more com-\nplicated form of cross-correspondence by first giving two\napparently disconnected messages to two different automatists\nand then revealing by means of a third message given through\na third automatist a hidden connection between the first two\nmessages. Obviously if the first part only of such an experi-\nment were carried out, the two disconnected messages would\nin their unsupported isolation fall to the ground, so to speak;\nwhereas if the first two messages were united by means of\nthe third messao-e all three would stand.\nOn Jan. 14 Myersp told Mrs. Verrall, who was present at\nthe sitting, that lie was preparing a long message for me, and\nexpressed the hope that when he had finished it I should\nbelieve he had sent it.\nOn Jan, 15 I asked if Myer.sp could give his answer to the\nLatin Message on the following day, and Rector advised me\nnot to press for an answer.\nOn Jan. 16 Myersp, through Rector, asked me not to be\nimpatient for his answer.\nAt Rector\u2019s request I again spelt out and pronounced the\nwords javuludiim committis, once at the beginning and once\nat the close of the sitting.\nAs described in Section III, I had asked Myersp at this sitting\nto mark cross-corresponding messages given to Mrs Verrall\nand Mrs Holland with a triangle within a circle. A little later,\nI impressed on M}mrsp the importance we attached to obtaining\ncross-corresponding messages, and expressed the opinion that\nit was \u201c more important to get them than for you spirits to\ngive facts about your past lives\u201d. To this Myerisp made a\nmost intelligent rejoinder:\u2014-Why, he asked, did we attach so\nmuch importance to them ;\nfor, said he, \u201c if you establish\ntelepathic messages, you will doubtless attribute all such to\nthoughts from those living in the mortal bod}^ ;\nwhile as a\nmatter of fact we are the living intelligences who actively\ntransmit and receive the messages\u201d. I contented myself by\nmaking the following, a]')parently unintelligent, reply :\n\u2014\u201cWhen\nyou say we should doubtless attribute these me.ssages to tele-\n\flvil] 319\nA Series of Concordant Automatisms.\npathy between living minds, I don\u2019t agree. It doesn\u2019t look\nlike telepathy at all. It looks to us jinst like the independent\nand intelligent action of external intelligences \u201d. This did not,\nand was not intended to, meet the criticism ot Myersp.\nThroughout the whole series of sittings the ex|:)erinienters, Mrs\nSidgwick, Sir Oliver Lodge and myself, gave no indication\nor hint of any kind that what we wanted was cross-corre-\nspondences of a complex type ;\nwe alwa3's spoke as if the\nonly object in view were to obtain the I'eproduction through\nanother automatist of the same word or words as those\nchosen either by ourselves or b\\' the trance-personalities for\nthe purpose.\nMyerSp, re-echoing an opinion just before expressed by myself,\nthen continued as follows :\n\u201c Both Hodgson and mj-\u2019self are\nextremely anxious to give jmu proof of our real existence\n;\nand I am more or less convinced that neither he or [.sic] I\ncan do so b}^ narrating our past experiences or those which\nwe have succeeded to retain \u201d.\nI replied :\n\u201c I think a combination of the two\u2014I mean\nnarrating past experiences and sending concordant messages\nthrough dift'erent lights\u2014is a telling method of proof.\u201d Here\nagain I was, of course, masking my real meaning under the\ncover of the indefinite term \u201c concordant me.ssages\nOn Jan. 23 I for the first time put, at Mrs Verrall\u2019s request,\nthe following c[uestion to Myersp :\n\u201c Which Ode of Horace\nentered deepl^^ into your inner life ?\n\u201d Immediatel}'\" after this\nhad been done, M^-ersp said :\n\u201c I should like to go over the\nfirst and second sentences of our Latin message ...

The juxta-position of these two subjects, for which\nI was in no way responsible, should be borne in mind in\nview of future developments. After an interval, during which\nother matters were referred to, I repeated Diversis mdlus\nappareat nexus.\nAfter Jan. 23 and up to Feb. 6 there was no fresh reference\nmade in the trance to the Latin Message. On the morning\nof Jan. 23 Myersp for the first time had said that he \u201cbelieved\n1 The connection between this question about an Ode of Horace and the\nLatin Message is explained on pp. 397-407.\n\f320 .\/. G. Piddington. [part\nhe could send me a message\u201d (i.e. a message in reply to my\nLatin Message). On the night of Jan. 23 Mrs Veri-all wrote\na script, and on Jan. 28 another script, clearly a sequel to\nthe former, the leading points of which Myersp reproduced on\nFeb. 11, and, on repeating them on Feb. 27, said that they\nformed his answer to the Latin Message. Also, on Feb. 3,\nMiss Vei\u2019rall wrote a script which connects with a .script written\nby her on Feb. 17 ;\nand both these scripts correspond with\nMrs Verrall\u2019s scripts of Jan. 23 and Jan. 28, and in part with\nthe description of them given by Myersp on Feb. 11 and 27.\nOn Feb. 6 Myersp said that he would reply to Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nGreek question (i.e. cu\u2019to? ovgavog ukvij^wv) and my Latin Alessage\nas soon as he could.\nOn Feb. 11, immediately after the references to the Library\nquoted in Section V (pp, 52-55), came the following :\n\u2014\n(Pre.sent : J.

If Miss Verrall\u2019s script of Feb.\n17 constitutes, as I think it may, one part of a complex\nreply to the Latin Message given jiartly through Mrs\nVerrall, partly through Miss Verrall and partly through Mi\u2019S\nPiper ;\nand if one may assume that Myersp was aware that\nthat part of this complex answer w^hich was ultimately\ngiven in Miss Verrall\u2019s script had not yet been given, and\nknew that until it was given the answer would be incomplete;\nthen, the doubt which MyerSp expressed on Feb 11 as\nX\n\f322 J.

[part\nto his ability to give a complete reply by Feb. 13 is cpiite\nappropriate.\nOn Feb. 12 I told Myersp that \u201c Browning, Hope and Star\n\u201d\nhad appeared in Mrs A^\u2019erralFs script :\n\u2014\nJ. Ct. P. Myers, I want to tell you that the message which you\nsaid you gave to Airs A'errall about Browning, Star\nand Hope has come out quite clearly.\n(Alyers communicating)\nthanks. I never tried with greater jiatience than I\ndid over those words.\nI then went on to say that Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s name, the name\n\u201cMyers\u201d and \u201cLibrary\u201d had, notwithstanding my previous\ndenial (v. p. 55), also appeared in Mrs A^errall\u2019s script.\nJust before saying farewell Myersp again begged me not to\n\u201c hurry or worry \u201d about his repl}^ to the Latin Message as\nhe would bring it out clearly.\nSitting of Feb. 13. On Feb. 11, just before the mention of\n\u201cHope, Browning and Star\u201d, Myersp had asked whether Mrs\nVerrall had received the word \u201cEvangelical\u201d. As I had found\nno trace of this word in Mrs A^errall\u2019s script, I asked Myersp\non Feb. 13 when he had given \u201cEvangelical\u201d to Mrs Verrall:\n\u201c Was it lately since you have talked with Mrs A^errall at\nthis light?\u201d [i.e. since Jan. 30, 1907]. To this Myensp replied:\n\u201cNo, I believe not, but recall it as one of my own words\nwhich I tried to give her \u201d. At a later sitting it rvas explained\nthat Rector, who acts as intermediary and amanuensis for all\nthe trance-personalities, had misheard the word which he\ntransmitted erroneously as \u201c Evangelical \u201d and that wdiat\nMyerSp had really wdshed to have conveyed was \u201c Evelyn\nHoj)e\u201d. Consequently, if Myersp was unaware of Rector\u2019s\nerror in transmission, he naturally must have been puzzled\nby my question, and especially by my saying that he himself\nhad said that he had given \u201cEvangelical\u201d to Mrs AVrrail, and\nunder these cii'cumstanees may have been led to fancy tliat\nhe liad really given the word at some anterior period. That\none trance-personality should appear to be ignorant of what has\nbeen said or written by another trance-personality, and even that\n\f323\nlvil] a Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nthe personality communicating through Rector should seem to\nbe ionorant of what Rector has said or written on his behalf,\nis a phenomenon frequently exhibited in the Piper trance\n;\nand, moreover, this discontinuity of consciousness is not only\nexplicitly asserted but is also often indirectly conveyed by the\nmost subtle touches ;\nand though, doubtless, it may sometimes\nserve as a convenient explanation of error, I believe it to be\noften a real cleavage and not one simulated for dramatic purposes.\nAfter answering the question about \u201c Evangelical \u201d Myersp\nwent on as follows: \u201cIf you will meet me on third after\ncoming [i.e. Wednesday, Feb. 20] I wdll give you my reply to\nyour message Latin\u201d. I then said to Myersp : \u201cI want to tell\nyou about \u201cBrowning, Hope and Star\u201d. Mrs Verrall has got\nthe references to all three quite precise and definite \u201d.\n1 propose to interrupt at this point my account of the\nreferences made to the Latin Message in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance\nin order to quote and discuss two scripts of Mrs Verrall\u2019s and\ntwo of Miss Verrall\u2019s. These scripts, which are given below\nin their chronological order, had all been written before the\nnext reference to the Message was made in the trance on\nFeb. 19; and before that date I had not only read them but\nhad read into them a meaning which aftected the whole\nsubsequent handling of the experiment.\nMrs Vcrrall's scrft of Jan. 23, 1907 (begun at 10.50 p.m.).\nJustice holds the scales.\nTliat gives the words but an anagram would be better.\nTell him that\u2014rats star tars and so on.

Again, the use of the letters A, B, C in the\ndrawing of the circle and triangle seemed to form a link\nwith the Latin Message. In the original draft in English the\nletters A, B and C had been used to represent the three\nautomatists who were to coopei'ate in the complex experiment.\nMrs Verrall, as I have said, had seen the original draft and\nconsequently knew of this use of the letters A, B and C. But\nnevertheless, and in spite also of its being a very natural thing\nto use the letters A, B, C in a geometrical illustration of this sort,\nthe I'act remains that she did introduce them into a script wliich\nshe did not connect in any way with the Latin Message.^\nBesides, the connection between the circle and triangle and the\npreceding part of the script is so close that it would be\ndifficult to regard what precedes the geometrical figure as mere\nsubliminal romancing uninfluenced by any other mind than\nthe automatists own, while regarding (as 1 think we must) the\ngeometrical drawing as the result of some supernormal influence.\nNo doubt the reasons which I had at the time for inter-\npreting Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of Jan. 28 as an answer to the\nLatin Message were slender, but they were even more slender\nthan they need have been because at this time I had not\nrealised the connection between Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of Dec. 17,\n1906,\u2014witli its line ;\n\u201c and the throbbing Soul\nSaw through the sound the burning of the flame \u201d\n:\n1 Under the date of Feb. 12, 19U7 Mrs Verrall wrote in her diary as\nfollows;\u2014\u201cA card from J.

Class, pp. 97-100). In the first of\nthese occur the lines\n:\n\u201cThroned on the whirling sphere, the astral fire.\nHid in whose heart thy whole creation lies,\n\u2014\nThe whole tvorld\u2019s ivonder mirrored in thine eyes,\n\u2014\nIn the script of Jan. 28 the words :\n\u201c the workl\u2019s luonder \u201d\n:\nimmediately precede and lead up to a quotation from The\nRing and., the Book\u2014\n\u201c And all a wonder and a wild desire \u201d\n\u2014\nas if for the purpose of hitching on the script of Jan. 28 to that\nof Dec. 17.\nThe coincidences between Mrs Verrall\u2019s two scripts and Mi.ss\nVerrall\u2019s two scripts of Feb. 3 and Feb. 17 have been already\ndiscussed in detail, so 1 need not reiterate them here. In view of\nthe fact that before Feb. 17 Mrs Verrall knew the interpretation\nwhich I had put upon her script of Jan. 28, and in view also of\nsome very general information given to Miss Verrall on Feb. 15\nabout the script of Jan. 28,^ two of these coincidences, viz.\nthe references in Miss Verrall\u2019s script of Feb. 17 to the \u201cStar\u201d\nand to Browning\u2014might easily be attributed to thought-\ntransference between Mi.ss Verrall and her mother. But Miss\nVerrall\u2019s script contains also coincidences with Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript of Dec. 17, to which Mrs Verrall attached no significance\nand of which Miss Verrall knew nothing. The latter script is\nreminiscent not only of Myers\u2019s translation of two Greek\nox\u2019acles but also of Dryden\u2019s Hymn for St. Cecilia\u2019s Day. Now\nthe \u201c heavenly harmony \u201d of Miss Verrall\u2019s script is an actual\nquotation from that poem of Dryden\u2019s ;\nand the script of\nDec. 17 contains the word \u201charmony\u201d twice, and, though it\n'For full particulars v. p. 67.\n\f330 .\/.

Common\nto both scripts also are the words \u201c diapason \u201d (which likewise\noccurs in Dryden\u2019s poem) and \u201cMystic\u201d; and neither word\noccurs elsewhere in either script dining the period under\nreview.\nBefore, then, the next reference to the Latin Message was\nmade in the trance, on February 19, I had become impressed, I\nmay even say, obsessed, with the idea that Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript of Jan. 28^\u2014which had on Feb. 11 been described in the\ntrance by Myersp as \u201c FLope, Star and Browniug\u201d\u2014was an\nattempt by Mjmrsy to give by means of indirect allusions to\nStanza VII of Aht Voghr an intelligent answer to the Latin\nMessage ;\nand I was naturally anxious to see whether Myersp\nwould say anything in support of this interpretation.\nOn Feb. 19 Hodgsoiip asked me to repeat some of the Latin\nto him and also to his \u201c old friend George \u201d, i.e. Geoi'ge Pelham,\nwho henceforth cooperates with Hodgsonp and Myersp in their\neffort to understand and reply to the Message. I repeated\nDiversis\u2014committis; and afterwards Hodgsoiip asked for \u201cthe\nnext to the last word \u201d i.e. jamducliim to be repeated.

It will appear later how extremely\nsignificant was this mixing up of Horace wdth the reply to\nthe Latin Message.\nOn March 6 Myersp said that he had tried to give a triangle\nwithin a circle to Mrs Verrall; Hodgsonp having apparently\nforgotten to inform him, as on Feb. 26 I had requested him\nto do, of its appearance in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script. I thereupon\nasked Myersp if he could remember when he tried to give\nthe circle and triaogle to Mrs Verrall or what other words,\nif any, he had made Mrs Verrall write at the same time.\nNo immediate reply was made to this question, and MyerSp\nwent on to mention other things with which he had tried\nto impress Mrs Verrall, and among them \u201cDel Sarto\u201d. I\nthen asked Rector to tell Myersp that he had been successful\nin making Mrs A^errall draw a triangle within a circle. From\nthis point I quote the record :\n\u2014\n(Present : J. G.

Will you give your answer to Mrs Sidgwick, as I shan\u2019t\nmeet you for a good many Sabbaths [i.e. weeks].\nThe .sitting of March 13 was the last at which I was\npresent. Mrs Sidgwick took over the management of the\nsubsequent sittings, and the conduct of the Latin Message\nexperiment passed into her hand,s. This accordingly seems\nto be a convenient point at which to interrupt the account of\nthe progress of the experiment in order to discuss the extracts\nquoted above from the sittings held between Feb. 19 and\nMarch 13.\nI will deal first with the question of how far the ti\u2019ance-\n])ersonalities gave proof of understanding any of the ])hrases,\nor individual words of the Latin Message.\nThe general meaning of the word intermmtiis^ was, I\nthink, unmistakably known to Myersp, though its special\napplication in the Latin Message was not, for he wrongly\napplied it to him.self, mistaking apparently the dative plural\ninternuntiis for the nominative singular internuntius. In his\nfirst and second reply accordingly he represents himself as the\n\u201cintermediary\u201d, whereas in the Message the mediums are the\n\u201c intermediaries \u201d.\nEqually unmistakable is the comprehension shown both by\nMyersp and George Pelham of the word jamdudum, wdiich\nthey respectively translated \u201c long since \u201d and \u201c for some\ntime \u201d.\n^ Lewis and Short define it as one who \u2018\nserves as a messenger or mediator\nbetween two parties or persons ;\na mediator, messenger, go-between \u2019.\n\f348 J. G. Plddington. [part\nThe meaning of invicem is likewise con-ectly expressed by\nthe word \u201cmutually\u201d. It is noticeable that siiecial trouble\nseems to have been taken with these two words, jamdudum\nand invicem. On Feb. 19 Hodgsotip asked for jamdudum to\nbe repeated and then explained that it had been the hardest\nword to understand. This repetition of the word on Feb. 19\nseems to have been effectual, for when it was repeated on\nFeb. 26 it was met with the remark \u201c1 understand rhat\u201d.\nSimilarly invicem was singled out for repetition by itself on\nFeb. 25 ;\nand on the following day when Myersp made his\nsecond attempt to reply he used the word \u201c mutually \u201d\n:\nwhereas in his first reply he had not done so.\nMy pronunciation of the word quod on Feb. 26 was greeted\nwith the remark \u201cYes, I know. \u2018What?\u2019\u201d Quod has this\ninterrogative sense, but in the Latin Message it is used as a\nrelative. The phrases used on Feb. 27 and March 6, \u201cAlthough\nI as intermediary\u201d and \u201cAlthough you have been for some\ntime uniting different ideas \u201d, suggest, however, very forcibly\nthat the trance-personalities understood quod to mean\n\u201c although \u201d.\nPeiliaps the phrase used on March 6, \u201c you fail to convince\nthe world \u201d etc., represents a bad shot at the meaning of\nf(dlit.\nAs already suggested, the phrase \u201c handing through \u201d used\non Feb. 20 may represent committis, which was used in the\nLatin Message to mean \u201c entrust \u201d or \u201c deliver \u201d. But the phrases\nsubsequently employed\u2014\u201c united \u201d or \u201c assimilated ideas \u201d, \u201c been\nuniting different ideas\u201d, \u201ccombine the ideas conjointly given\u201d\n\u2014have every appearance of representing another ti\u2019ansla-\ntion of the word. Committere is used by Latin authors\n\u2014\nboth prose-writers and poets\u2014to mean \u201c to join together \u201d,\n\u201c to combine \u201d, \u201c to connect \u201d or \u201c to unite \u201d\n;\nthough this sense\nof the word is not found in Cicero, and the style of the\nLatin Message is Ciceronian. Still, the trance-personalities\nwere not informed that the Latin was Ciceronian, and if\nthey gave committis an un-Ciceronian sense they were not to\nblame. If, as I have suggested, internuntiis was understood\nas internuntius and if committis was taken to mean \u201c unite \u201d,\nit explains the translation given in the trance : \u201c you as\n\fLVII.] 349\nA Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nintermediary {intermmtius) have long since {jamdudum)\nunited (eomniittis) mutually ideas {invicem inter se respon-\ndentia) \u201dd\nBut, if it is admitted, as I think it will be, that the\ntrance-personalities realised that the Message concerned cross-\ncon\u2019espondences, the translations which they gave are susceptible\nof the following alternative explanations:\u2014Unaware, as I have\nsaid, that the style of the Latin Message was severely classical,\nthey may have thought that we had by conjoining inter\n(\u201c between \u201d) and nuntium (\u201c a message \u201d) concocted a word to\nrepresent \u201c cross-correspondences Diversis internuntiis would,\non this supposition, mean \u201c by means of various cross-corre-\nsponding messages\u201d, and the first sentence, if quod be omitted,\nmight then be translated thus :\n\u201c By means of various cross-\ncorresponding messages you have long since united mutually\nideas\u201d; and this translation except for the first four words\nresembles that given in the trance, and the first four words\nare closely represented by the phrase used by Myersp on\nFeb. 27: \u201cthis all helps to combine the ideas as conjointly\ngiven through Mrs Verrall and this light\nIf the translations given in the trance are to be explained\nin this way, then we must suppose either that the phrase\n\u201c I as messenger or intermediary \u201d was a first and incorrect\ntranslation, perhaps, as will appear directly, afterwards recti-\nfied; or that in using this phrase MyerSp was merely\nparaphrasing instead of translating, and bringing out the\npoint that he was the messenger or intermediary to whose\nagency the combination of ideas in the various cross-corre-\nsponding messages was due.\nIn order to complete this discussion of how far individual\nLatin words or phrases were understood by the trance-person-\nalities I quote here out of their chronological order two extracts\nfrom the final versions of the Latin Message given at the sitting\nof June 2:\u2014\u201cYou have long since been trying to assimilate\nideas one with another\u201d ;\nand \u201c For a long time you have been\nassimilating ideas one with another through different lights\u201d.\n^At the time the sittings were in progress I did not know that committere\ncould have the sense of \u201cto unite\u201d or \u201ccombine\u201d; so it was not from my\nconsciousness that this information was acquired.\n\f350 [part\nJ. G.

This may be true, but at any rate\nthe procedure adopted by the experimenters was deliberate\nand in part designed to throw the trance-personalities off the\nscent. The conduct of a seiies of cross-correspondence experi-\nments was the chief object for which we had invited Mrs\n\fLvii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 351\nPiper to England^; and of this object it was accordingly neces-\nsary to inform the trance-personalities. To speak quite openly\nand unrestrainedly on the subject of cross-correspondences on\nthe one hand, and on the other to show both by our action\nand our words that we were anxious to render the subject of\nthe Latin Message unascertainable in any normal manner,\nseemed to be the best method of concealing the fact that the\ntwo subjects were in any way allied.\nThe reply of Myersp on Feb. \u201817, in my opinion, shows\nacquaintance not only with the thoughts actually expi\u2019essed\nin the Latin Message, but with the line of thought by which\nMiss Johnson and myself had been actuated when we planned\nthe experiment. This line of thought may be briefly expressed\nas follows :\n\u2014\nThe phenomena of several automatists known to us\u2014but\nespecially those of Mrs Verrall and Mrs Holland\u2014exhibit\nsimple instances of cross-correspondence, and also cross-corre-\nspondences of a more complex and less direct type. These\nlatter grow more elaborate as time goes on, and exhibit the\nappearance of being due to the action of a third mind. But\nthough they do furnish fairly strong fa.cie evidence of\nthe intervention of a third mind, we are of opinion that to\nexclude the theory of telepathy between the minds of the\nautomatists, we ought to obtain a series of cross-corresponding\nmessages so obscurely and remotely connected that the con-\nnection between them shall not be apparent to us until it\nhas been revealed by means of a third message given through\na third automatist.\nI think that a certain amount of agreement can be traced\nbetween what Miss Johnson and I had been thinking- and\nwhat Myersp said on Feb. 27: \u201cI felt a little perturbed over\nyour message to me when you said I failed (?) in replying\nsufficiently to convince you etc. although I as intermediary\nhad long since united my ideas. Now I believe that since\nyou sent this message to me I have sufficiently replied to\nyour various questions to convince the ordinary scientific\nmind that I am at least a fragment of the once incarnate\n^ Mrs Piper iu her normal state was given no hint of what our chief\nobject w'as.\n\f352 J. G. Piddington. [part\nindividual whom you called Myers.\u201d Now we had in reality\ntliought, though we did not say so in the Latin Message,\nthat the concordant communications from \u2018\nMyers \u2019\nin Mrs\nVerrall\u2019s and Mrs Holland\u2019s scripts, though extremely sug-\ngestive, were, owing to the lack of the qualities explained\nabove, insufficient to establish the operation of a third mind.\nLike Oliver Twist we wanted more, but we also wanted\nsomething better as well. Tliat was the thought behind the\nLatin Message, and the words of Myersp just quoted, though\nthey may only represent a misunderstanding of id nec fallit\nnos consilium, perhaps suggest that he was vaguely aware\nof it.\n(b) But though Myersp may have apprehended this much,\nis there any evidence to show that he understood the nature\nof the \u201csomething better\u201d, namely, of the complex type of\ncross-correspondence described in the second sentence of the\nLatin Message ?\nO\nThere is certainly no direct evidence to this effect. Indeed,\nso far as the actual language of the trance- personalities goes,\nthe evidence points the other way. Thus on March 6 George\nPelham said ;\n\u201c You .said in order to convince you he [i.e. Myers]\nshould repeat a message not only through Mrs V. but it should\nbe reproduced here\u201d [i.e. through Mrs Piper]; and, \u201cif you\ncan give a clear message through Mrs V. and reproduce it here\n\u201d\netc.; and MyerSp on May 7 (v. p. 392) said: \u201cgive it [i.e. \u2018out of\nthree sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star\u2019] to\nmy friend [i.e. J.G.P.] and tell him this is my final answer\nto his request for a definite C C message\u201d; and again on\nMay 27 :\n\u201c He [i.e. J.G.P.] wished me to give a message through\nMrs Verrall and this light [i.e. Mrs Piper] concerning the\nS(xme subject; and this was his me.ssage to me in Latin ^\n^ There are, however, two passages where the language suggests that\nMyersr was aware that \u201cBrowning Hope and Star\u201d was a cryptic summary\nrather than a straightforward verbal reproduction of what Mrs Verrall had\nwritten. The first occurs in the sitting of March 6: \u2014Rector said: \u201cI under-\nstood it was a cross-correspondence message, and to her [i.e. Mrs Verrall] I\ngave the same words that I brought out here ;\nas the poem was one I knew\nhim [i.e. Myers] to give me\u201d. Not realising at the time that Myersp and\nRector were at this point communicating in rapid alternation, and failing in\nconsequence to apply the various pronouns correctly, I did not grasp the sense\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms. 353\nThe expressions \u201c repeat \u201d, \u201c reproduce \u201d, \u201c a clear message \u201d,\n\u201ca definite C.C. message\u201d and \u201ca message . . . concerning the\nthe same subject\u201d apply to simple forms of cross-correspondence\nbut not to the complex form of them described in the Latin\nMessage. Neither mere repetition nor reproduction, nor clear-\nness nor definiteness was what we asked for.\nBut if the trance-personalities really thought that what we\nasked for was the simple reproduction of the same word or\nphrase or idea through two or more automatists why did they\nthroughout consistently give \u201cBrowning, Hope and Star\u201d, and\nthat only, as embodying the successful execution of the experi-\nment which we had asked them to pei\u2019form ?\nIt was on Feb. 27 that Myersp first stated that \u201c Browning\nHope and Star \u201d constituted his reply to the Latin Message.\u2019-\nBefoi\u2019e this statement was made the trance-personalities had\nbeen informed of the success of four cross-correspondence experi-\nments : viz. of \u201c Library, my own name and Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s\n\u201d\nand of \u201cBrowning, Hope and Star\u201d on Feb. 12; of \u201cArrow\u201d\non Feb. 25; and of \u201ca triangle within a circle\u201d on Feb. 26.\nIf they thought that all they had to do in order to make a\nsuccessful reply to the Latin Message was to bring off a simple\ncross-correspondence, why did they pitch on \u201c Browning Hope\nand Star \u201d rather than on one of the other successes ? Again\nwhy did they mention \u201c Browning Hope and Star\u201d only, instead\nof giving all four as examples of their execution of the test\nasked for in the Message ? And why, again, when later on\nthey were informed of other successful cross-correspondences,\ndid they still confine themselves to citing \u201c Browning Hope and\nStar \u201d as their sole answer ?\nof the above passage. So Myersp, partly in order to put me on the right\ntrack, and partly, I think, in order to modify Rector\u2019s statement that he\nhad given the same -words to Mrs Verrall as he had brought out through\nMrs Piper, intervened with the remark: \u201cI told Rector to tell you that I\nunderstood and replied saying it loas the poem in which Hope and\ncame out\u201d.\nThe second passage occurs in the sitting of April 8 (v. p. 364, in the course\nof which MyerSp said :\n\u201c I at once went to Mrs V. and wrote out these lines,\nand I returned here and cpioted a few fragments of the poem \u201d.\n1 It should be noted that lie did this immediately after having requested me to\nrepeat the second sentence of the Latin Message.\nZ\n\f354 [part\nJ. G. Fiddington.\nIf, howevei\u2019, in spite of their inability to make plain in words\ntheir comprehension of the request contained in the Message,\nthe trance-personalities did I'eally understand it, then their\nchoice of \u201c Browning, Hope and Star \u201d becomes at once intelli-\ngible ;\nfor it was the first cross-correspondence of a complex\ntype which occury^ed in the seiies of expyeriments carried on\nbetween Mrs Piper and. the other automatists. Previous to\nits occurrence the other coincidences had been of a simple,\nstraightforward kind ;\nand though subsequently to its occurrence,\nwe find other instances of simple cross-correspondence, still we\nalso find cross-correspondences of a complex type : e.g. \u201c Light\nin West\u201d, \u201cO\u2019er mountain lakes rivers and stream\u201d, and\n\u201c Thanatos\nIt is in these cross-correspondences and not in the formulated\nreplies made by the trance-personalities that I am disposed to\nfind that intelligent response to the Latin Message which\nMyersp was asked to make.\nBut did \u201c Browning Hope and Star \u201d really reproduce all the\nessential features of the experiment described in the Latin\nMessage ? In my opinion it did not, and I regard it rather\nas a first and only partially successful attempt to carry out\nan experiment on the lines laid down in the Message. Section\nXIX of this paper, however, contains an account of a batch\nof phenomena which I think may be fixirly claimed as ful-\nfilling with essential, if not with absolutely formal, exactness\nthe conditions stipulated in the Latin Message.\nAt this point it would be well to enquire what type of\ncomplex coincidence, if not the exact typ>e demanded in the\n]\\lessage, does result from a collation of Mrs Veri'aH\u2019s scripts\nof Jan. 23 and 28, Miss Verrall\u2019s scripts of Feb. 3 and Feb. 17\nand the various references made in the trance to \u201c Browning\nHope and Star\u201d.\nI take \u201cBrowning Hope and Star\u201d to be the simplest\nexpression of three leading and allied ideas ;\nthe skeleton\nframework, as it were, on which a more complicated structure\nwas to be built. In the script of Jan. 23 \u201cstar\u201d emerges in\nan English, in the script of Jan. 28 in a Greek anagram ;\nand\nin this latter script \u201chope\u201d is worked in by means of a mis-\nquotation, and \u201cBrowning\u201d by means of quotations from two\n\flvil] a Series of Concordant Automatisms. 355\nof his poems, his name not actually appearing. \u201cHope\u201d is not\nexpressed in Miss Verrall\u2019s scripts at all; but in both her\nscripts great emphasis is thrown on \u201cstar\u201d, in the first by a\ndrawino; of it, in the second hv an airagram followed bv the\nwords \u201c and a star above it all In this second script\n\u201cBrowning\u201d is worked in by means of an allusion to the Pied\nPiper of Hamelin and his rats, and \u201cBrowning\u201d is also\ncombined with \u201cStar\u201d by making the \u201crats\u201d of Hamelin town\nform one of the variants of the anagram of which \u201cstar\u201d is\nanother variant. But complex though the scheme is, it does\nnot meet the recpiirements of the Latin Message, for the\nconnection between Mrs Verra,irs \u201c Star \u201d and \u201c Browning \u201d and\nMiss Verrall\u2019s \u201cStar\u201d and \u201cBrowning\u201d would have always been\napparent had the reference to \u201c Browning Hope and Star\n\u201d\nnever been made in Mrs Piper\u2019s trance ;\nall that this reference\ndid was to reveal the point of the misquotation of \u201chope\u201d for\n\u201cpassion\u201d in the script of Jan. 28. Part of the scheme mis-\ncarried, for, as the extracts quoted above from the sittings of\nFeb. 11, Feb. 27 and March 6 show, an effort had been made\nto refer in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script to two of Browning\u2019s poems,\n\u201cMy Star\u201d and \u201cEvelyn Hope\u201d; with the intention apparently\nof thereby introducing another variation on the simple theme\n\u201c Browning, Hope and Star \u201d.\nAt the sitting of March 6 \u201c Del Sarto \u201d was mentioned among\nwords given to Mrs Verrall, but it was not explicitly stated\nthat \u201cDel Sarto\u201d was a cross-coi\u2019respondence word intended for\nMrs Verrall. So on March 11 I said to Myersp : \u201cAt our last\nmeeting the words \u201cDel Sarto\u201d appeared without any e.vplaua-\ntion. Will you explain them either now or at our next\nmeeting?\u201d Myensp replied: \u201cI have tried this wdth Mrs V.\nseveral times \u201d. \u201c Have you any special reason\u2014 \u201d I began\nto ask, when Myersp interrupted me with the remark :\n\u201c Oh !\nyes, I am reserving that until the third\u201d, i.e. till March 13.\nOn March 13, however, no reference at all was made to \u201cDel\nSarto \u201d. So on April 8 Mrs Sidgwick, at my request, again asked\nwhy \u201c Del Sarto \u201d had been given to Mrs Verrall as a cross-\ncorrespondence. Myersp replied :\n\u201c Because it was a good test\nand was also brought to my mind by my attempt at the\npoem \u201d. The context shews that by \u201c the poem \u201d the poem of\n\f356 J. G. Piddington. [part\nBi\u2019owning\u2019s connected with \u201c Hope and Star \u201d was meant. I\nhad asked for an explanation of the choice of \u201c Del Sarto\n\u201d\nas a cross-corresponding message because in view of (1) the\nappeax\u2019ance of anagrams on the word \u201cstar\u201d in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscripts of Jan. 23 and 28 and in Miss Verrall\u2019s sci\u2019ipt of\nFeb. 17, of which knowledge had been shewn by Myers?;\nand (2) the previous introduction of the titles of two of\nBrowning\u2019s poems, Evelyn Ho]je and My Star, for the\nappai\u2019ent purpose of increasing the number and complexity of\nthe variations on the \u201c Browning Hope and Star \u201d theme, it\nstruck me as a by no means extravagant conjecture that \u201cDel\nSarto \u201d had been selected for the followino; reasons ;\n\u2014\nIt is part of the title of a poem of Browning\u2019s, Andrea d.el\nSarto, and from it can be formed the anagram \u201c Lode star\nHence in a sense there would be im[)licit in it allusions to\ntwo out of the three leading ideas \u201cBrowning, Hope and\nStar\u201d.\nI believe that an attempt was made on Feb. 27 to compli-\ncate the cross-correspondences based on \u201c Bi'owning Hope and\nStar\u201d .still further. This attempt I find in the allusions to\n\u201c Halcyon days \u201d, \u201c evangelic \u201d (afterwards explained as given in\nerror for \u201cEvelyn Hope\u201d), \u201cthe shrub Syringa\u201d, \u201cmy own and\nBrowning\u2019s ]ioems \u201d, and \u201c My Star \u201d : all of which, except the\nlast, \u2014and that was twice conjoined later on with \u201cEvelyn\nHope\u201d\u2014Mjmrsp said \u201chelped to combine the ideas as con-\njointly given through Mrs Verrall and this light \u201d. To deal\nwith these allusions properly I should have to discuss some\nmatters of a rather private nature, and as I believe I could\nnot reach any definite conclusion and could at most bring\nout only some interesting and suggestive points, I prefer to\nleave this problem untouched. At the same time I should\nlike to record my opinion that, in spite of vagueness and con-\nfusion, there was sense behind these particular communication,s.\nThe references to the Ode of Horace I postpone for later\ndiscussion ;\nand there remains only one small point to touch\non before I resume the account of the pi\u2019ogress of the\nexperiment.\nIt will be remembered that as early as Feb. 11 I had seen\nin the indirect allusions to Stanza VII of Aht Vogler (which\n\fLVii.] A Series of Concordant Aiitomatisms. 357\nI thought Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of Jan. 28 to contain) an implicit\nreply to the Latin Message. As time went on I evidently\nforgot at moments that the allusions to this stanza were\nimplicit only and not explicit, and unfortunately I embodied\nthis mistake in some of the remarks which I addressed to\nMyersp and George Pelham on the subject of the Latin\nMessage. Thus on March 6 I said :\n\u201c I do believe that Myers\nhas answered the Latin Message clearly and intelligently\nthrough the otlier light [i.e. Mrs Verrall] ;\nbut he has not shown\nthrough this light that he has done so \u201d\n;\nand on March 13 ;\n\u201cWhen you [i.e. Myers] gave it [i.e. \u2018your answer\u2019] through\nMrs Verrall you made a detailed reference to a particular\npa.ssage. You have not made such a detailed reference here.\nAVill you give it here also ?\n\u201d.\nFortunately this silly mistake of mine^ did not, so far as\nI can see, confuse the trance-personalities; and it may even\nperhaps have had a good result, for it seems possible that it\nmay have led Myersp to display still further acquaintance with\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script of Jan. 28 and with Miss Verrall\u2019s of\nFeb. 17, by reproducing points explicitly expressed therein to\nwhich he had previously made no allusion (v. pp. 411-13).\n^ I have only one excuse to offer for my mistake, and that is the difficulty\nexperienced by the experimenter in preventing his mind from being distracted\nby the multifarious duties which are entailed in the charge and conduct of\nMrs Piper\u2019s sittings. He has to decipher the script\u2014no easy matter ;\nhe has\nto seize the sense of what is written ;\nhe has to reply to questions, and often\nto puzzle his brains to concoct an answer which will not diverge too widely\nfrom what he really thinks on the one hand and from what he guesses may\nprove palatable to the trance-personalities on the other ;\nhe has to watch\nMrs Piper\u2019s hand to see that it does not overrun the margin of the paper ;\nhe has to tear off each sheet as it is finished from the writing-block ; he has\nto see that the pencil in use is in good order ;\nhe has to watch the state of\nMrs Piper\u2019s breathing and to see if her left nostril is clear of the pillow\non which her head rests ;\nhe has to open or shut the windows in order to\nkeep the temperature at a point which meets with the approval of Rector\n;\nhe has to look after the fire when there is one ;\nhe has to make a record of\nwhatever he himself or the sitter says ;\nand amid these preoccupations he\nhas to try to conduct complicated experiments. If under these circum-\nstances\u2014and especially when Rector, as sometimes happens, insists on the\nwindows being kept wide open in bitter wintry weather\u2014he sometimes fails\nto keep his thoughts clear, he may, I hope, be excused.\n\f358 J.

It is difficult.\nYes and a difficult word to get through . . . but I shall try\nuntil he U.D. it.\nAt the sitting held on April 10 Rector asked if \u201c Hoi\u2019izon \u201d\n\u201ca\ncloudless sky beyond the horizon \u201d had appeared, and explained\nthat \u201c Myers gave it \u201d. Mrs Sidgwick took this to mean \u201c has\n\u2018Horizon\u2019 etc. appeared in Mrs Piper\u2019s script\u201d, and replied that\nit had ;\nbut Rector may have meant to ask if \u201c Horizon \u201d etc. had\nappeared in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script, for just immediately before he\nhad asked whether a cross-correspondence message intended\nfor Mrs Verrall had \u201cgot through \u201d\n;\nand also I know of no other\ninstance where Rector displayed uncertainty as to what had\nappeared in Mrs Piper\u2019s script.\nAt the beginning of the sitting of April 15 Rector asked\nwhether Mrs Verrall had written D W, the first two letters of\n\f365\nLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\na cross-correspondence \u201cDwarf\u201d, and something like \u201cMountain\u201d.\nFrom this point the record proceeds as follows:\n\u2014\nE. M. S. Will you ask Mr Myers why he chose that sentence about\nHorizon ?\n(Rector communicating) ....

[\u201c all this \u201d, as\nalso Rector\u2019s \u201c that was one of them \u201d, must apparently\nrefer to \u201cthat sentence about Horizon\u201d. A\u2019ote hij J. G. P.]\nE. M. S.

S. It is clear ;\nbut I should like to know why \u201c horizon \u201d came as\ndistinct from \u201c hope and star \u201d.\nBecause it was that special passage which was suggested from\nhis message to my mind.\nE.

In order to follow\nthis subordinate incident it must be borne in mind throughout\nthat on April 2-t Myersp successfully identified the poem of\nBrowning\u2019s which he claimed to have alluded to in the phrase\n\u201c Hope Star and Browning \u201d as Abt Vogler.\nThe question about the Ode of Horace was put to Myersp for\nthe first time on Jan. 23, 1907 in the following way :\n\u2014\nJ. G. P. I have two questions from Mrs Verrall to put to 3\n'ou ....\nDo not, of course, answer them to day unless jmu like ;\nbut do not in any case answer them when Mrs Verrall\nis here. (J. G. P. then put the first question.) Now I\nwill give you the second question :\n\u201c Which Ode of\nHorace entered deeply into your inner lifei\u201d (J. G. P.\nrepeated the question three times, each time reading it\nfrom a written note. On the third occasion he added\n\u201cHorace, the Latin poet\u201d.)\nMjmrsp, after the question had been put, said: \u201cthis I\nshall have to recall and dwell upon at some length after I\ncease to communicate today before I can bring out an intelligent\nreply \u201d.\nI myself had no knowledge or means of guessing what the\nanswer should be.\nNo further reference was made to the subject until Feb. 27.\nAt the sitting held on that day Myersp made his second attempt\nto answer the Latin Message ;\nand in the course of it stated\nthat he had I\u2019eplied to it already in messages given partly\nthrough Mrs Piper and partly through Mi's Verrall; and that\none of these messages was \u201c with reference to the Poems and\ncross-corresponding messages as given . . . through Mrs Verrall\u201d.\nI asked what poems were meant by \u201c the Poems \u201d, and Myer.sp\nreplied that he meant his own poems and Browning\u2019s ;\nand\nadded that he was thinking chiefly of \u201c Browning\u2019s lines as\ngiven through Mrs Verrall\u201d. But before this last statement\n\f398 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nwas added the word \u201cHorace\u201d was disconnectedly written,\ntliough in a context which must be held to have meant that\nHorace\u2019s poems were to be joined with \u201c Browning\u2019s and my\nown \u201d (v. p. 335).\nThe next reference to the subject was made on March 4,\nwhen Myersp spontaneously alluded to the question about the\nHorace Ode as follows :\n\u201c I tried to make my thoughts clear\nto you about my difficulty in replying to Mrs V.\u2019s question\nabout Horace. Did you understand . . . that I could not reply\nfor some time about Horace. Did he [Rector] refer to it at\nall ?\n\u201d I said I thought not ;\nbut that Horace had been con-\nnected with his own answer to the Latin Message. Myersp at\nonce said this was a mistake :\n\u201c it came to my mind while\nspeaking that I had not replied to it; but in my desire to\nreply to your message doubtless there was some confusion \u201d.\nConfusion there doubtless was, but I believe it was confusion\nof an intelligible and extremely suggestive kind, for, as I\nshall presentl}^ show, MyerSp answered the question about the\nOde of Horace by means of allusions to two poems of Frederic\nMyers\u2019s and to Browning\u2019s Aht Vogler.\nThe next reference to the subject was on April 17, when\nMrs Sidgwick reminded Myersp of his ])romise to answer the\nquestion. Myersp said: \u201cI recall the question, and I had Ode\nto Nature on my mind; but as I thought I loved another ode\nbetter I did not reply until I could say it more clearly. Do\nyou remember immortality? . . I thought I could answer\u201d.\nMrs Sidgwick saw no sense in this, nor did I when I read\nthe record. I understood Myersp to mean that there was an\nOde of Horace known as the \u201cOde to Nature\u201d, and that he\nhad first thous;ht of this Ode as being the one which had\nentered deeply into his inner life, but had subsequently remem-\nbered another Ode which he had loved better, but that so far\nhe had not succeeded in mentioning it through Mrs Piper. The\nquestion \u201cdo you i-ememher immortality?\u201d I dismissed as\nrubbish.\nMonths later I noticed that Ode to Nature and Immortality\nare the titles of two poems by F. W. H. Myers published in\nFragments of Prose and Poetry\n:\na book unknown to Mrs Piper\n(v. pp. 109-110). Between Hoi'. C.

The\ncentral thought of Myers\u2019s Immoi'tcdity\u2014of which I quote\npart of the first and the whole of the second and last stanza\n\u2014T take to be this :\n\u201c The prospect of annihilation is painful\n;\nbut the prospect of an aimless, inert and monotonous im-\nmortality is as bad, or even worse\nLo all that age is as a speck of sand\nLost on the long beach when the tides are free.\nAnd no man metes it in his hollow hand\nNor cai\u2019es to ponder it, how small it be;\nAt ebb it lies forgotten on the land\nAnd at full tide forgotten in the sea.\nII\nYet in my hid soul must a voice I\u2019eply\nWhich knows not which may seem the viler gain,\nTo sleep for ever or be born again.\nThe blank repose or drear eternity.\nA solitary thing it were to die\nSo late begotten and so early slain.\nWith sweet life withered to a passing pain,\nTill nothing anywhere should still be I.\nYet if for evermore I must convey\nThese weary senses thro\u2019 an endless day\nAnd gaze on God with these exhausted eyes,\nI fear that howso\u2019er the seraphs play\nMy life shall not be theirs nor I as they.\nBut homeless in the heart of Paradise.\nOf the \u201c Archytas \u201d Ode (i.e. Hor. C. I. 28) the view taken by\nmost commentators is this: \u201cAll men, even philosophers and\nother great men, and even men who have been reincarnated,\nmust die But this Ode has been generally recognised to be\na perplexing one ;\nand the clue to the right interpretation of\nit lias perhaps been lost. So obscure, indeed, is its purpose\nthat Wickham says \u201cit would be hard to find two editors who\nagree\u201d about it. An individual scholar, such as Frederic Myers,\n\f400 \u2022\/. G. Fiddington. [part\nfor instance, might naturally then put his own individual con-\nstruction upon it. I am going to suggest a view of the Ode\nwhich I myself do not believe is the true one (11. 16-20 seem\nto me to be almost conclusive against it), but which I believe\nFrederic Myers\u2014reading, a little wilfully, perhaps, his own\nmy.sticisin into it\u2014may well have held. It may be expressed\nthus :\n\u201c Archytas spent a life actively engaged in the study of\nscience and philosophy; Tantalus and Minos in kingly duties ;\nTithonus in the delights of love; and Pythagoras passed not one\nbut two active and varied lives on this earth, first as Euphorbus,\na warrior in the Trojan war, and afterwards as Pythagoras, a\nphilosopher and man of science. Yet what availed all their\nearthly activities ? All are now condemned to joyless, inert,\naimless, shadowy, monotonous existence in the Underworld.\nMight they not say as Achilles to Odysseus :\n\u2018\nNay, speak not\ncomfortably to me of death. Rather would I live above ground\nas the hireling of another . . . than bear sway among all the\ndead that be departed \u2019\n? For death is not the end of all ;\nit\ndestroys only the sinews and the flesh (\u2018niliil ultra Nervos\natque cutem morti concesserat atrae\u2019). So neither death nor\nannihilation is what men have to dread, but rather the prospect\n\u2018\nthat evermore I must convey These weary senses thro\u2019 an\nendless day\u2019 in \u2018The blank repose or drear eternity\u2019 of the\nUnderworld.\u201d\nThe vei'bal resemblances between Imviortcdity and Hor. C. I.\n28 are these :\n\u2014\n\u201cNo man metes it\u201d (i.e. that age, which is as a speck of sand)\nand arenae mensorem\\ \u201con the long beach\u201d and 'prope litiis\nMatinum, and the variant lyrope latum Matinum; \u201cspeck of\nsand \u201d and indveris exigui munera.\nThese resemblances in language are slight enough, particularly\nthe last ;\nbut in estimating what they may be worth, the fact\nmust not be lost sight of that the two poems which present\nthem presented, according to my theory at least, to the mind\nof the author of one of them a resemblance in thought as\nwell.\n1 am now inclined to inter[)ret the answer given on April\n17 by Myersp\u2014\u201cI had Ode to Nature on my mind, but as I\nthought I loved another ode better I did not reply until I\n\f401\nlvil] Series of Concordant A utomatisms.\ncould say it more clearly. Do you remember immortality ?\n\u201d\n\u2014\nthus :\n\u2014\n\u201c I first thought of an Ode of Horace to which I had made\nallusions in my poem Ode to Nature ;\nhut afterwards I re-\nmembered another Ode of Horace which was a greater favourite\nof mine and which was in my mind when I wrote my poem\nImmortality\nI cannot assert that Myers\u2019s Ode to Nature contains any\nvery direct reference to an Ode of Horace, but I do see in it\nan echo of Hor. C. III. 4. Horace in this Ode tells the story\nof how once in his early boyhood the \u201c storied doves \u201d of the\nGoddess of Love had covered him, as he lay asleep on the\nhills, with a garland of fresh laurel and myrtle leaves as a\nforetoken of his I'uture fame as a poet. In the Ode to Nature\nthe poet is speaking of the hopes and dreams which \u201clured\nfi om child to man the vision-haunted boy \u201d\n;\nand as he recalls\nhovv in his youth he had at times felt that poetry was his\ntrue vocation, he is reminded, so it seems to me, of Horace\u2019s\nallegorical avowal of the same youthful sense of innate poetic\ngifts\nSometimes the flying flame\nWas Fortune and was Fame;\nThro\u2019 cloudy rifts a wildering clarion rang;\n\u2014\nOfteuer an Orphic crown.\nFrom deep heaven fluttering down.\nLit on a poet\u2019s head, and sweet the poet sang.\nBut first and last and best.\nMost longed-for, least contest.\nOne form unknown descended as a dove\n;\nLow in my soul I heard\nOne new melodious word.\nAnd all the boy\u2019s frame trembled at the touch of Love.\nIt is true that in Horace\u2019s Ode it is the doves of the\nGoddess of Love that placed the crown of laurel on the\nfuture poet\u2019s head ;\nwhereas in Ode to Nature the Orphic\ncrown was not brought by doves but fluttered down from\nheaven, and it is \u201c One form unknown \u201d which \u201c descended as\n\f402 J.

A reader of his verse\nor prose writings can hardl}^ fail to observe how fond he was\nof giving a fresh and modern turn to the many classical\nallusions which occur in them. And that is what I believe\nhe did in this instance.\nThe next reference to the Horace question was made on\nApril 24, when, at the close of the sitting held on this date,\nMrs Sidgwick asked Myersp to give her \u201cat the next\nopportunity \u201d his answers to Mrs Verrall\u2019s questions about\nthe Greek words and about the Ode of Horace. Mrs\nSidgwick did not attend another sitting till May 1.\nMeanwhile at the sitting of April 29, at wdiich Mrs Verrall\nand Miss Johnson were present, Rector asked if Myers could\nrejdy about the Horace question to Mrs Sidgwick on May 1.\nIn the waking-stage of the trance of April 29 were thi\u2019ice\nuttered the words : \u201c passed out of their bodies and gone \u2019\u2019\n\u2014\na misquotation of \u201c passed through the body and gone \u2019\u2019\nfrom\nStanza V Abt Vogler\u2014and they were followed by the words\n\u201c every peak and point .... star Abt \u2019\u2019\n\u2014a misquotation of\n\u201c not a point nor peak but found and fixed its wandering\nstar\u2019\u2019 from Stanza lY of the same ]ioem. Mrs Yen-all heard\nand recorded these words, but did not connect them with\nher question about the Ode of Horace ;\nand she did not\nrecognise \u201c passed out of their bodies and gone \u2019\u2019\nas a mis-\nquotation from Abt Vogler.\nMrs Yerrall harl in January, 1907 asked me to put the\nquestion about Horace to Myersp, but T had not told her, nor\nhad she learnt from any other quarter, that the question had\nactually been put, and she had forgotten about it. But she\nwas reminded of it by Rector\u2019s reference to it on April 29\n;\nand at the sitting of April 30, at which she was present, she\ntook the opportunity of putting the question again to Myersp\nin this form :\n\u201c I asked if you could rememljer which of\nHorace\u2019s Odes }mu once told my husband had specially entered\ninto your inner life. You wiote it to my husband after he\nsent you a book he had written about Horace\u201d. Myersp\npromised in reply to think the matter over and said he\n\f403\nlvil] a Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nthought he would be able to remember, but he gave no hint\nthat an answer had already been given.\nAs stated above, on Apxil 24 Mrs Sibgwick had asked\nMyersp to give his answer to the Horace question on the\n\u201cnext opportunity\u201d. On May 1 she had her first sitting\nsince April 24, and on May 1 \u2014-which was also the day fixed\nby himself, on April 29, for replying to the Horace question\n\u2014\nMyersp asked if she remembered his \u201c reference to the Poem \u201d,\ni.e. Browning\u2019s Poem Aht Vogler\\ and then added \u201cDo you\nremember when 1 said I had passed through my body and\nreturned ? \u201d. Mrs Sidgwick, not realising that these words\nwere reminiscent of Aht Vogler, asked \u201cDo you mean you\ngave the name of the poem ? \u201d. To this MyerSp at once\nreplied ;\n\u201c Oh yes. I mean I tried to give another part also,\nwhich referred to completed happiness in this life and the\npossibility of returning to the old world again to prove the\ntruth of survival of Bodily death. Those words were\nlingering in my memory and I gave it as peak followed\nStar Miss Johnson then told Mrs Sidgwick that Myersp\nwas quoting from Aht Vogler, and both then naturally\nassumed that M}mrsp in making these further quotations was\nmerely emphasising the point that Aht Vogler was connected\nwith his reply to the Latin Message, and they consequently\nmissed the true significance of the phrase :\n\u201c I tried to give\nanother part also \u201d. Kector equally failed to realise what\nMyersp was driving at, for he said that Myersp was speaking\nabout his writing Aht Vogler through Mrs Verrall. Myersp\nseemed to be aware that his meaning had not been grasped,\nfor he preluded another misquotation from Aht Vogler\u2014\n\u201c What is to be shall be, and what should be shall be soon\n\u201d\nfor \u201c What was, shall live as before ;\n. . .

She had no idea that either\nOde to Nature or Immortality contained Horatian echoes, and\nat the time of the sittings and till as late as April 10, 1908\nshe was under the impression that it was the allusion to\nreincarnation which had interested Myers in Hor. C.

Mr Myers does not say [in the letter] why the\nOde had entered into his inner life (I think that is the phrase) ;\nno\ndoubt it is the reincarnation theory advanced in it that appealed to\nhim.\nOn April 10, 1908, Mrs Verrall sent me the original letter\nwith this comment :\n\u2014\nI don\u2019t think on looking at it that it is the reincarnation that\nspecially appeals to Mr Myers j\nthough of course the reincarnation\nwould well serve to describe the Ode ;\nit is, e.g., the first thing\nthat occurs to me in connexion with it. But with him it seems to\nbe the opening lines that \u2018\nentered into his inner life\nI have not read his letter since 1885, when I knew him very\nslightly and was [not] specially interested in his inner life.\nIf my view of the significance of the quotations from Aht\nVogler is not accepted, and they are regarded as allusions to\n\u201c reincarnation \u201d, then to this extent the answer given by\nMyersp corresponded to Mrs Yerrall\u2019s anticipations ;\nbut her\nanticipations will not account for the reference made by\nMyersp to Immortality and Ode to Nature.\nAerias teutasse donios animoque rotuiiclum\nPercurrisse polum morituro.\nThey are thus rendered by Conington :\n\u2014\nThe sea, the earth, the innumeralde sand,\nArchytas, thou coulds\u2019t measure ;\nnow, alas !\nA little dust on Matine shore has spann\u2019d\nThat soaring spirit ; vain it was to pass\nThe gates of heaven, and send thy soul in quest\nO'er air\u2019s wide realms; for thou hadst yet to die.\u201d\n\f408 J.

[part\nDiscussion of the References to the Latin Message made\nIN THE Trance between March 20 and June 20, 1907.\nDuiing Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s conduct of the Latin Message experi-\nment the object aimed at was to obtain answers to two\nquestions; (a) What was the name of the poem of Browning\u2019s\nwhich had been described by Myersp as \u201c Browning, Hope and\nStar\u201d; and (b) What line in that poem would serve as an\nintelligent reply to the Latin Message. The answers wanted\nwere, as Mrs Sidgwick knew, to (a) Aht Vogler ;\nto (b) \u201c That\nout of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star \u201d.\nBoth answers were in the end correctly given by Myersp\n;\nthe first after some confusion and, perhaps, after one or two\nfalse starts, the second without any beating about the bu.sh.\nI will first discu.ss how the answer to (a) emerged.\nThe passages quoted from the sitting of March 20 I take\nto be a first vague attempt to describe Aht Vogler. Those\nquoted from the sitting of April 8 are full of confusion.\nThe poem of Browning\u2019s, which had hitherto always been\nreferred to as \u201c Browning, Hope and Star \u201d, was said to con-\ntain the words \u201c I lonely wandering Star \u201d, \u201c I wander lonely\nmy Star \u201d. I cannot doubt that we have here an illustration\nof the confusion which on Feb. 20 M}^ersp had said was likel}^\nto arise between his answer to the Latin Message and cross-\ncorresponding messages (v. p. 331). On March 20 \u201c I wandered\nlonely as a Cloud \u201d, and on March G \u201c Mj^ Star \u201d had been\nmentioned as cross-correspondences. On April 8, Myersp, I\nconjecture, had in his mind the line in Aht Vogler \u201c Not a\npoint nor peak but found and fixed its wandering star \u201d\n;\n(a quotation afterwards applied to the question about the\nOde of Horace) but he confused it with \u201c I wandered lonely\nas a Cloud \u201d and \u201c My star \u201d\n;\nand hence resulted the absurd\njumble \u201c lonely wandering Star \u201d and \u201c I wander lonely my\nStar\nBut there was, I believe, further confusion still with La\nSaisiaz.

Siazies \u201d were not due\nto reminiscences of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of Jan. 17, 1904 and\nof her comments on it. Now in view of the evidence presented\nin this paper it would not have been unreasonable to suggest\nthat Myersp might have possessed acquaintance with the script\nof Jan. 17, 1904; but to suggest that MyerSp, regarded as a\npersonality distinct from Mrs Piper\u2019s normal personality, was\nacquainted with Mrs Verrall\u2019s published comments on that\nscript would be extravagant, and all the more so since Mrs\nPiper had read parts of Froc. Vol. XX., and consequently may\nhave read these comments. Hence I feel bound to conclude\nthat at least some of the confusion displayed in the Hance on\nApril 8 and 17 was due to the intrusion of vague recollections\nof things with which Mrs Piper was normally acquainted.\nOn April 8 and 17 Myersp must be held to have indicated\nLa Saisiaz as the ])oern of Browning\u2019s meant by \u201c Browning,\nHope and Star\u201d, in spite of the fact that when Mrs Sidgwick\nasked him point-blank whether this was his meaning he said no,\nand that so far he had not been able to get the name of the\n\f410 J. G. Piddington. [part\npoem through. But this denial was not worth much, for the\nmere fact that it was necessary to ask this question, and\ndoubtless also the absence of enthusiasm on Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s\npart when La Saisiaz was given, were sufficient hints that\nLa Saisiaz was not the right answer. It is all the more curious\nthat La Saisiaz should have been named, because previously\nthe connection of the poem of Browning\u2019s with the circle and\nwith \u201cwandering star\u201d, and the phrase \u201cDon\u2019t you remember\nthe word Sky coming out also in the poem \u201d suggest that\nMyersp had previously been on the right scent.\nOn April 17 MyerSp promised to give the name of the poem\non April 24, and on April 24 he did give it by naming Aht\nVogler. Wlien, however, Mrs Sidgwick asked why Abt Vogler\nconstituted an appropriate answer to the Latin Message Myersp\nsaid it was \u201c because of the appropriate conditions mentioned\nin it which applied to my own life \u201d. The answer Mrs Sidgwick\nwanted was that Aht Vogler had been chosen because it\ncontained the words \u201c out of three sounds he framed, not a\nfourth sound, but a star \u201d. The answer given by MyerSp was\nnevertheless an intelligent one. It meant, as I understand it,\nthat he had chosen as subjects of cross-correspondence messages\nnot mere verbal counters, such as single words or ])hrases which\ncould possess only dry intellectual associations and associations\ncommon to countless other minds, but subjects so stamped and\npenetrated with his own individual emotions that they should\nserve as evidence for the identity of the chooser. (Cf. p. 75.)\nOn April 17 Mrs Sidgwick had asked M3\u2019erSp to say what\nparticular passage in the poem of Browning\u2019s he had meant to\nrefer to. Myersp said he would do so, but though he promised\nto give the name of the poem on April 24 he did not tix any\n|)articular day on which to give the passage in question. On\nApril 24 he did give the name of the poem, Aht Vogler \\\nbut\ndid not make any attempt to give the passage. So, when on\nMay 6 Myersp expressed his belief that he had given a sufficient\nanswer to the Latin Message, Mrs Sidgwick said: \u201c \\vl Aht Vogler\nthere is a [larticular line which specially answers the Latin\nMessage. The Latin Message, as you know, refers to cross-\ncorrespondences, but also to something more, and thei\u2019e is a\nline in Aht Vogler which we think you had in mind as\n\fLVii.] A Series of Goncordcmt A^domatisms. -til\ndescribing that something more. It would be very good if\nyou could give it here\u201d. MyerSp promised to think the matter\nover, and to give the line to Rector in the same way that he\nhad given the words \u201c Plotinus \u201d and \u201c Homer\u2019s Iliad \u201d, and, as\nhe might have added, \u201c Abt Vogler\u201d.\nThe very next day, May 7, MyerSp, immediately after greet-\ning Mrs Sidgwick, said :\n\u201c If the foui'th is a Star what would\nthe third be \u201d. Various attempts were made to give the\nexact quotation, but without complete succes.s. Still more\nthan sufiicient success was achieved to place it beyond dispute\nthat \u201c out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a\nstar\u201d was meant.\nKnowledge, then, was shown by Myersp of the general\nsense of the Latin Message, of the meaning of some of the\nindividual words of it, of the name of the poem Aht Vogler,\nand of the line \u201cout of three sounds he frame, not a fourth\nsound, but a star\u201d. Three at least out of these four answers\nwere known to Mrs Sidgwick and Miss Johnson, and all four\nanswers to Mrs Verrall and myself ;\nand we had all had\nsittings with Mrs Piper. Consequently telepathy between the\nliving may easily explain this much of the case ;\nthough it\nmay be advisable to add that though telepathy may cover\nthese facts it does not necessarily follow that it is the true\nexplanation of them.\nIf we suppose that the result was due to telepathy between\nMrs Piper and the sitters, the long time it took for two\npoints of the answer\u2014the name of the poem and the line\nabout the star framed out of three sounds\u2014to emerge is ratlmr\ncurious, for ever since Feb. 11 both had seized upon my\nimagination and been often in my thoughts, and both were\nknown to three other sitters, Mrs Sidgwick, Mrs Verrall\nand Miss Johnson.\nBesides giving these answers, MyerSp between March 20 and\nMay 7 also displayed increased knowledge of Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript of Jan. 28. Thus, on April 8, with reference to the\npoem of Browning\u2019s summarised in the words \u201c Browning, Hope\nand Star \u201d, he said :\n\u201c Don\u2019t you remember the word Sky\ncoming out also in the poem ? \u201d\n;\nand this mention of the\nword \u201c Sky \u201d\n\u2014which occurs twice in the script of Jan. 28\n\f412 J. G. Piddington. [part\nand twice in Abt Vogler\u2014was made before the poem was\nidentified as Aht Vogler. Again, after the poem had been\nidentified, Myei\u2019Sp on May 6 said: \u201cWould it he clearer to\nyou if I said \u2018\nhoped \u2019\n? \u2018\nhoped \u2019\nseparate word. Does it\nconvey my meaning any clearer ? Do you remember the\ndelight and joy of Abt and then the longing and final hope ?\nThese sentences seem to display a most astonishingly accurate\nknowledge of Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of Jan. 28, for that script\nhad contained the word \u201c hope \u201d in the phrase \u201c the hope that\nleaves the earth for the sky \u201d, an obvious misquotation of\n\u201cThe passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky\u201d.\nMyersp, it must be borne in mind, had first connected the\nwords \u201cBrowning, Hope and Star\u201d which he claimed to have\ngiven to Mrs Verrall, with an unspecified poem of Browning\u2019s,\nand then afterwards had identified this poem as Aht Vogler.\nBut though hope pervades Aht Vogler the word \u201chope\u201d does\nnot occur in it; only the word \u201choped\u201d. What then Myersp\nmeant on May 6, so it seems to me, was this :\n\u2014\u201c I summarised\nAht Vogler in the phrase \u2018Browning, Hope and Star\u2019, and\nI also made Mrs Verrall write the word \u2018hope\u2019 when I was\nmaking her quote passages from Aht Vogler. I did this in\nspite of the fact that the word \u2018hope\u2019 does not occur in Aht\nVogler but only the word \u2018hoped\u2019.\u201d\nJust before this MyerSp had said: \u201cmy reply was about the\npoem, and long ago I gave the word Music \u201d : a remark which,\nthough it does not show increased knowledge of the script\nof Jan. 28, 1907, does, I think, show acquaintance with Mrs\nVeirall\u2019s script of Dec. 17, 1906; and this latter I regard, for\nreasons explained elsewhere (see pp. 329-330), as closely con-\nnected with the former.\nOnce more, after indicating the line \u201c out of three sounds\nhe frame, not a fourth sound, but a star\u201d, Myersp on May 7\nquoted :\n\u201c in my passion to scale the sky \u201d\n;\nand remarked\n\u201cPassion is the chief word\u201d. Now in the script of Jan. 28\nthe line in Aht Vogler \u201c The passion that left the ground\nto lose itself in the sky \u201d is misquoted as \u201c the hope that\nleaves the Earth for the sky\u201d, and the word \u201cpassion\u201d is\nrepresented only by the Greek words epw? TroOeivoi- If the\nextensive acquaintance with the script of Jan. 28 previously\n\f418\nLVii.] ^1 Series of Concordant Aidomatisms.\nshown in the trance be taken into consideration, I do not\nthink that it is unreasonable to regal\u2019d what was said by Myersp\non May 7 as indicating a knowledge both of the substitution\nof the word \u201c Hope \u201d for the word \u201c Passion \u201d in the misquota-\ntion contained in that script, and of the signiticance of the\nsubstitution. Lastly, when on June 2 Myersp was essaying his\nfinal translation of the Latin Message, he perhaps manifested in\nthe words :\n\u201c he [i.e. J. G. P.] said also, if you will give me a\nmessage\u2014not a message really but a sign of some kind through\nthe lights\u2014corresponding message \u201d etc. : a knowledge of the\nrepag (sign) of the script of Jan. 28, and of the words \u201c that\nwas the sicrn \u201d which followed the drawing of the star in Miss\nVerrall\u2019s script of Feb. 17.\nOn May 27 Myersp in his translation of the Latin Message\nused the words: \u201cI wish you to give through Mrs Verrall\n. . . such proof of the survival of bodily death in such a way\nas to . .\n.\nprove conclusively the survival of bodily death \u201d\n;\nand \u201c But what I ask is for you to give such jiroof of the\nsurvival of bodily death, and in such a way as to make it\nconclusive.\u201d The use of the phrase \u201c in such a way \u201d might\nbe thought to suggest that Myersp was here endeavouring\nvaguely to describe the plan for the working of complex\ncross-correspondences set forth in the Latin Message. But I\nthink the phrase \u201c in such a way \u201d was simply an echo or\nparaphrase of a sentence spoken Vw Mrs Sidgwick. On May 6,\nwhen Myersp said that the Latin Message referred to his\ngiving proofs of survival \u201c by or through C. C. messages \u201d,\nshe had replied :\n\u201c Yes, in a particidar %vay\nOn April 24 Hodgsonp asked if \u201cMars the planet\u201d, \u201cJove\u201d\nand \u201cEgla\u201d [sic] had appeared in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script; and\nthen Myersp said that he had given Mrs Verrall the words\n\u201cEzra\u201d, \u201cwhat vaunts life\u201d, \u201cVaunt\u201d, \u201ctranscends\u201d, \u201cthe\nstar spark flame \u201d, and added :\n\u201c whereas it is diflicult to get\nthrough the words one after the other I believe I can make\nyou [i.e. Mrs Sidgwick] understand that I know what I gave\nher [i.e. Mrs Verrall]\u201d. The words \u201cMars\u201d, \u201cJove\u201d, \u201cstars\u201d,\n\u201c flame \u201d, and \u201c transcends \u201d all occur in the second stanza,\n\u201cvaunt of life\u201d occurs in the fourth stanza, and \u201cspark\u201d in\nthe third and fifth stanzas of Browning\u2019s Rabbi ben Ezra. If\n\f414 J. 0. Piddington. [part\nwe exclude \u201cEzra\u201d, which is part of the title of the poem,\neight words in all wei\u2019e mentioned, and five out of these\neight occur in the second stanza. It would seem, then, that\nHodgsoup and Myersp meant that they had tried to make\nMl\u2019S Verrall write some lines from the first four or five stanzas\not Rabbi ben Ezra, a poem containing 32 stanzas in all; and,\nsince five out of the eight words mentioned occur in the last\nthree lines of the second stanza, that it was these lines\nwhich they specially wished to indicate. The last three lines\not this second stanza, which consists of six lines in all, are as\nfollows\n:\n\u2018Not that, admiring stars.\nIt yearned \u201cNor Jove, nor Mars;\nMine be some figured flame which blends transcends them all.\u201d\n\u2019\nAlthough directly after these words taken from the early\nstanzas of Rabbi ben Ezra had been given MyerSp went on to\ngive Abt Vogler as the name of the poem meant by \u201cBrowning,\nHope and Star\u201d, it was not till 13 days later (May 7) that\nhe succeeded in indicating the particular line in Abt Vogler\u2014\n\u201c That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but\na star\u201d\u2014that answered the Latin Message. Still it looks as\nif on April 24 Myersp was hot on the scent, for the \u201c figured\nflame \u201d in Rabbi ben Ezra is closely analogous to the star\nin Abt Vogler, which blends and transcends the three sounds\nout of which it is framed. It looks, too, as if Myersp on\nApril 24, though unable at the moment to recall the actual\nwords of it, knew the gist of the line in Abt Vogler; and\nwas familiar enough with Browning\u2019s poems to be able to\nindicate, by quoting prominent words contained in them, other\nlines of Browning\u2019s which embod}^ an idea closely resembling\nthe idea expressed in the Abt Vogler line.\nThe discovery of these two analogous ])assages demands, in\nmy opinion, a greater familiarity with Browning\u2019s poems than\nMrs Piper normally possesses. But that the reader may be\nin a position to form his own opinion on this point, I append\nsome notes written by Miss Alice Johnson and Sir Oliver\nLodge, which will furnish him with the necessary data.\n\f415\nLVii.] A Series of Concordant Automatisms.\nNotes re Mrs Piper\u2019s Knowledge of Browning\u2019s Poems.\nNote ivritten by Miss Alice Johnson on May 1907.\nAfter the sitting of Tuesday, May 7th, Mrs Sidg-wick asked\nMrs Piper what poets she had chietl}^ read, saying that\nvarious quotations had come in the script and she wondered\nwliether they were from poems that slie had I'ead or not. Mrs\nPiper said that she used to read Longfellow, Whittier and\nsome one else (I forget who, but I think an American), and\nthat this was about all. Mrs Sidgwick asked whether she\nhad read much of Tennyson, Shakespeare, Browning or Milton.\nShe said, \u201c pi\u2019actically nothing.\u201d She seemed to regard Shakes-\npeare and Browning as about equally remote and obscure.\n'I'he next day she said that she and Alta [her elder daughter]\nhad been thinking over what she could have read, and she\nremembered that Mr Stead had sent her several of his little\nbooks of select poems, among which was Browning\u2019s Flight of\nthe Duchess. This, as far as 1 remember, was the only one of\nBrowning\u2019s. Minerva [her younger daughter], however, had\nsome volumes of Browning\u2019s which she was fond of, being\nmore interested in literature than her mother and sister. Mrs.\nPiper thought she might also have read The Princess or part of\nit, and said that Mr Hodgson had given her Coleridge\u2019s poems.\nNote written hy Miss Alice Johnson on May 'lith, 1907.\nAt the Council Dinner on May 26th, I asked Mi.ss Reed\n[i.e. Miss E. M. Reed, M.D., an Associate of the S.P.R., who\nresided with Mrs Piper during her stay in London] if she\nknew what books Mrs Piper had been reading while she was\nat 42 Morpeth Mansions, and especially whether she had read\nany of Browning. Miss Reid said that she believed Mis Piper\nread extremely little altogether, but that she remembered her\nlooking one evening at a small volume of Browning, belonging\nto Minerva. She thought this had ha|ipened three or four\nweeks before. I imagine this was a volume of selections,\nprobably the one mentioned to us by Mrs Piper and Alta [on\nMay 8]. I gathered from Miss Reid that Mrs Piper had spent\nsome time turning over the leaves of the volume.\n\f410 J. G. Piddington. [part\nNote hy Sir Oliver Lodge written on May 'M)tli, 1907.\nLast night I read to the Pipers and some of my family a\npoem which had come from America; and then Abt Vogler.\nShe wanted to know who was the author. I asked the girls\n[i.e. Mrs Piper\u2019s daughters] if they knew it; they said they\nlearned some of it at school, and they seemed to remember\nthe last verse fairly. I told them that it was Browning.\nMrs Piper then said she knew Evelyn Hojye and had heard\nof The Flight of the Duchess ; she did not know the one I\nhad I'ead at all, and asked its name. I told her, but the\nname seemed to suo;o-est nothino-.\nI then asked Minerva if she had any volume of Browning,\nand she said she had a scliool book, but not here. Mrs Piper\nthen said she herself had had a gorgeous one given her, bound\nin calf with gilt edges, .some years ago ;\nit was kept locked\nup, and had hardly been out of its box ;\nshe did not remember\nhaving opened it ;\nit was too nice to handle. Her father-in-\nlaw gave it to her, he being in the book business. It was\nnow locked up in her store-room in America.\nLater, when my sons had gone out of the room, she asked,\na little resentfully, why I had catechised her and the girls on\nthe subject ;\nwas it to show up their ignorance ? I then told\nher that it was for evidential reasons, and this made her\nhappier. She said she supposed everybody knew Browning\nnowada}^s ;\nI told her that it was by no means the case, and\nthat I had not expected her to know\u2014perhaps not even as\nmuch as she did.\nI then asked if she had noticed the verse about combining\nthree sounds. She did not specially remember that, and I\ndoubt if she caught the sense; it evidently had made no\nimpression on lier.\n\fLVII.] An Incident in Mrs. Pipers Trance. 417\nIII.\nAN INCIDENT IN MES PIPER\u2019S TRANCE:\nBeing an attcmi^t to elicit from MycrSp evidence of acquaintance\nwith a circuntstance in the life of Frederic Myers.\nBy Mrs Henry Sidgwick.\n[T\/iis paper should be read in connection toith Section V. of\nMr Piddington\u2019s pagocr.]\nAfter Mrs Verrall had had two or three sittings with Mrs\nPiper she asked me if I could give her any good question to\npj^t to MyerSp ,\nthe trance personality calling itself Myers.\nShe wished if possible to exclude explanation by thought\ntransference by asking some question the answer to which\nwould have been known to Mr Myers, but not to any of us\nhere now, and which would yet be verifiable. Such questions\nare not easy to find and I failed to think of one ;\nbut as a\nsecond best experiment it seemed worth asking a question of\nwhich the answer would certainly be unknown to any one\npresent at the sitting. I accordingly wrote to Mrs Verrall\nas follows on January 19, 1907 :\nI have not succeeded in thinking of any question which could\nbe asked the Myers control, of which the answer is verifiable\nbut unknown to any one ;\nbut 1 have thought of a cqiestion of\nwhich the answer is known to me ^ and almost certainly unknown\nto you.

I am not sure whether Mr Myers had\n1 At this time all I had seen of Mrs Piper since her previous visit to England,\nIS years ago, was a friendly call I had paid her at the end of December 1906,\nor beginning of January 1907, so that we could hardly be regarded as\nlikely to be in any special rapport with each other.\n2 D\n\f418 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nalready seen [Mr Sidgwick] for the last time, but in any case\nwe knew that death must come before many days. Mr Myers\nsought that conversation in order to talk about a specific concrete\nsubject, and he also spoke of another specific concrete subject in\nthe course of the conversation. Can he remember anything about\neither subject and what he said ? I could give further clues if\nyou think it advisable, but anything I say had better be said in\nwriting, so that we may know exactly what it is. He should be\npressed for details of what he said\u2014more than a mere general\nreference to the subject. If you approve of the question and\nwould like to have it in reserve in case the occasion comes for\nasking it, I will write an account of the conversation, put it\nin a sealed envelope and send it with a covering letter to\nMr Piddington.\nThe following is an extract from the memorandum thus\nsent to Mr Piddington on January 22, 1907, and not opened\ntill September 17, 1907 ;\nIn August 1900, when Mr Myers was at Terling Place for the\npurpose of taking leave of [Mr Sidgwick], he sought a conver-\nsation with me which took place out of doors in the porch of\nthe house. IVhat he wished to talk about was a Memoir of [Mr\nSidgwick]. He was determined that one should be written, had\npersuaded [him] to write some reminiscences with a view to it,\nhad at one time\u2014since the knowledge of [Mr Sidgwick\u2019s] illness\u2014\nintended to write it himself, but had withdrawn from this on\naccount of his own book and the sliort time remaining before his\nown expected death.

I regretted, therefore, that instead\nof reminding him of the place where the conversation\noccurred, she asked him what the place was. The effect was\nnecessarily to make it less certain which of the different\nconversations was referred to (for there must have been more\nthan one at Terling and more than one out of doors), and\nalso to divert effort on to an attempt to recall independently\na detail which w\u2019as of no value from the point of view of\nthe experiment, since it was known to Mrs Yerrall.

Kindly repeat very clearly if you will be so kind.\n(Mrs V. begins to repeat her last remark.)\nFirst what 1\nMrs V. Point.\nOh point ! I understand quite ;\nanother point came up in our\nconversation.\nMrs V. Yes, that\u2019s right.\nNow let me see if I can recall what that point was. I\nremember referring to one or more things but whether\nthey were mentioned on that day I can\u2019t be absolutely\ncertain. However, I do recall asking her what I have\npreviously referred to.\nMrs V. Yes ;\nquite so.\nAnd I believe I referred to some work of his which I should\nlike to have to bring out to live. I believe I understand\nand have answered.\nI will tell Mrs Sidgwick.\nI find my memory rather fragmentary on some points.\nMrs V.\n\f422 Mrs. Henry SidgiuicL [part\nMyersp had not so far referred to the points about which I\nhad asked, and except that the conversation took place out of\ndoors (which Mrs Verrall knew), I could not confirm anything\nhe had said. Of course a good deal of the sentiment corre-\nsponded with what Mr Myers felt and may have expressed,\nthough on the other hand there is no particular reason to\nsuppose that he did put into words what he must have known\nI should know he was feeling without his giving utterance to\nit. He may have spoken about leaving a sealed envelope,\nbut I think it very unlikely that he did so on that occasion.\nIt was too late, and, moreover, I had probably told him weeks\nbefore that there was one. It is not improbable that he may\nhave referred to unfinished work and the possibility of publishing\nit, but I cannot definitely recall his doing so. I wrote to\nMrs Verrall on January 28:\nI doubt whether the experiment is worth pressing, but if the\ncontrol returns to the subject you might say that I cannot remember\nwhether he talked of those things in that conversation, but they are\nthings he would be feeling. The things I asked him to remember\nwere specific things, both involving action on my part. Perhaps it\nwould be a prit}^ to give more clue than this at prresent, but I will\nif you like. Should you like me to fix my mind on the things\nto-morrow morning so far as I can, on the chance of the cpiestion\ncoming up at the sitting 1\nIf my thinking of the questions had had any effect it would\nof course have reduced the experiment to one in telepathy; but\nas a matter of fact, though the question was referred to at the\nsitting of January 29, no progress was made. The following\nis the record of what was said ;\n\u2014\n(Myers communicating)\nNow tell me about my talk with her. I must understand\nwhether I talked this over with her on that day or at\nsome other time.\nMrs V. I will tell you. Mrs Sidgwick thinks that on that day i\nyou and she said such things ;\nbut that was not what\nshe wanted you specially to remember.\n1 This was a mistake. I am inclined to think the contrary.\n\flvil] 423\nAn Incident in Mrs. Pipers Trance.\nWell if I am alive at all I do certainly recall mentioning\nthis to her.\nMrs V. Yes: she says she is sure that you spoke on that subject;\nbut she wants you to recall two specific things in your\nconversation with her at Terlin\" which led to action on\nO\nher part.\nLet me think this over more carefully and I can be trusted\nI believe to reproduce it here as soon as I sufSciently recall.\nThe next reference to the subject was on February 5, when\nMr Piddington introduced it. He was at the moment the only\nsitter.\nJ. G. P. Is that M}\u2019ers ?\n(Myers communicating)\nYes.\nJ. G. P. You remember when I put you a question in which the words\n\u201cseances\u201d and \u201c Leckhampton \u201d occurred you did not at\nfirst understand them.\nI did not hear them very well.\nJ. G. P. Well, I think it possible that in the same way you did not\ncatch a word that occurred in the question put to you by\nMrs Yerrall on behalf of Mrs Sidgwick.\n\\Yhat was it 1 I may be better able to understand more\nthan at that time.\nJ. G. P. The word I think you may not have caught was \u201c Terling \u201d\n(repeating the word distinctly once or twice). Terling\nis the home of Lord Eayleigh.\nOh yes. I positivel}\u2019 never heard, i.e. to grasp the word\nbefore. You are right in this. I understand now and\nwill go over that interview and if you refer to this I will\ngive my answer tomorrcnc?-\n^ Though Myersp accepts the suggestion that his not catching the word Terling\nwas a cause of difficulty, I do not think it really was. The important point w'as\nthat the conversation took place very shortly before my husband\u2019s death. This\nMyersp understood, as is shown by his answers to ^Irs Yerrall, and no such con-\nversation could have taken place except at Terling.\n\f424 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nMyerSp accordingly recurred again to the subject the next\nday (Feb. 6) when Mr Piddington was having a sitting alone\nwith Mrs Piper.\n^\n(Myers communicating)\nI [I\u2019emember] \u201c the name of the place to which you referred\nlast time and I should say with regard to it that I remem-\nber vaguely making a suggestion to Mrs Sidgwick regarding\na certain document which I thought she would find neces-\nsary to be attend to.\nJ. G. P. Is that \u201cbe attended to\u201d?\nLook into in case our good friend came over here. Besides\nI referred to matter pertaining to the College if I remember\nrightly; also a library matter which slie will recall Cjuickly.\nJ. G. P. Yes, I will tell her.\nI feel sure of the distinction between the places, i.e. my talk\nwith her at T. and my own house.\nEegarded as guesses at the answers to my question these are\nneither true nor plausible, but perhaps they were not all meant\nto be referred to that conversation. MyerSp clearly had two\nconversations in view^ Unfortunately, however, I cannot recall\nany conversation on these subjects between Mr Myers and myself.\nThe question whether \u201c library \u201d was simply a bad guess at the\nsubject of the Terling conversation or not cannot be thus briefly\ndismissed because of the cross-correspondence concerning it which\nMr Piddington has fully discussed (v. pp. 46-59). I will\nbriefly recall the facts here. On February 4, 1907, Myersy said\nin Mrs Verrall\u2019s script\n:\nGive the message I gave but was it understood ? On the\nCouncil I asked and she said Yes. Tell Mrs Sidgwick\nthat and something about the Gurney Library which I\nthink she will remember or a Gurney memorial, which\nshe was to take over. I will give the message elsewhere\ntoo to day but this is easier than the other place. The\nsignature might help H. Sidgwick.\nWe have tried for that to day. Wait for their answer\nF. W. H. M.\n'Mr M'Dougall was present, but only as an oiilooker.\n^\u201cRemery\u2019\u2019 was written, but \u201c remember \u201d must have been meant.\n\fLVII.] An Incident in Mrs. Piper s Trance. 425\nOn February 5 and 6 Myersp wrote as above quoted in\nMrs Piper\u2019s script. On February 11 \u2014the sitting with Mrs\nPiper following that of February 6 \u2014Mr Piddington said to\nMyerSp\n:\nJ. G. P. You will remember that at our last meeting you said that\none of the subjects of the conversation between you and\nMrs Sidgwick was connected with a library.\n(Myers communicating)\nYes, I recall.\nMr Piddington then went on to refer to a message from\n0 O\nIMyerSy about a library having come through Mrs Verrall\u2019s script,\nand to ask MyerSp to say what had appeared there\n;\nJ. G. P. I want you to tell me, if you can, how your message came out.\n(Myers communicating)\nYes I am aware of this but just how much she understood\n1 am not sure. But what I do wish her to understand\nis that during my conversation with Mrs S. the library\nwas referred to as an important transaction, as I feel sure\nI recall it and wish very much to impress it upon Mrs V.\nso as to confirm my utterances here.\nJ. G. P. Yes, I see.\nI think she wrote or got the message that he S. was glad or\npleased about the library. What I said to her was. Write\nfor Mrs Sidgwick that we talked about library.\nA little later on in the sitting, and in spite of Mr Piddington\u2019s\ndenial that my name had occurred in Mrs Verrall\u2019s script (he\nwas thinking of another piece of Mrs A^errall\u2019s script concerning\nlibrary, viz. that of February 6), MyerSp maintained that he\n\u201c persistently repeated the word \\i.e. library] to her ;\nalso my\nown name and Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s.\u201d\nThe correspondence between Mrs Verrall\u2019s script and Mrs\nPiper\u2019s in the matter can hardly be accidental, and on February\n11 \u2014whatever we think of February 6 \u2014MyerSp undoubtedly\nseems to be under the impression that \u201c library \u201d was a subject\nof the conversation with me which he had been asked to recall.\nWe have therefore this difficulty : If \u201c library \u201d was a pure guess\n\f426 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nof the Piper trance-personality, how did it come to coincide with\nMrs Verrall\u2019s script ? If, on the other hand, both scripts were,\nas they alleged, inspired by Myers, how did they come to make\na guess so much off the spot ?\nI wish to suggest another alternative, namely, that neither\nIMyerSy nor i\\IyerSp originally intended to connect \u201c library\n\u201d\nwith the Terling conversation at all, and that MyerSp did\nconnect it on February 11, owing to a confusion introduced\nby Mr Piddington\u2019s definitely so connecting it in his first\nquestion. It will be observed that there is no prima facie\nreason for supposing Mrs Verrall\u2019s script of February 4, taken\nby itself, to refer to the Terling conversation.^ As already\nremarked, the Piper script of February 6 refers to two\nconversations, and does not say in which of them \u201c library \u201d was\na topic. Mr Piddington, however, took it at the time to mean\nthat it was a subject of the Terling conversation, and framed\nhis first question on February 11 accordingly. Mrs Piper\u2019s\ntrance-personalities, in whatever way we interpret them, are\nsuggestible, and are feeling after information often very dimly\nand fragmentarily perceived ;\nthey welcome any information\nthat comes to them without apparently caring, or even always\nknowing, whence it comes. MyerSp might therefore readily\nfollow Mr Piddington\u2019s lead and speak of \u201c library \u201d as a\nsubject of the conversation.\nIn any case, we are left with the choice of regarding \u201c library\u201d\nas a bad guess at the subject of the Terling conversation super-\nnormally connected with a similar bad guess in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nscript, or of regarding it as altogether unconnected with the\nepisode at present under discussion. I shall quote all further\nreferences to supposed conversations about libraries between\nMr Myers and myself, so that the reader may have everything\nbefore him ;\nbut the subject is never again definitely connected\nwith the Terlin\" conversation.\nO\n^ I do not know that Mrs Verrall did connect the two at first. If she did,\nshe thought the guess so had that she did not send it to me. But when she\nsaw the record of Mrs Piper\u2019s script of February 6, she, like Mr Piddington,\ntook it to mean that \u201clibrary\u201d was mentioned as a subject of the conversation,\nand she annotated it thus: \u2014\u201cNote that my script, which seems to have\nbeen guessing on its own account about Mrs Sidgwick\u2019s conversation, suggests\n\u2018Gurney Library\u2019 as a topic.\u201d\n\fLVii.] An Incident in Mrs. Pipers Trance. 427\nBoth the \u201clibrary\u201d and the \u201cdocument\u201d reappear at the\nsitting of February 13, the first sitting at which I was myself\npresent. As the object of my presence was to learn how to\nmanage the sittings, in order to be able to take Mr Piddington s\nplace later, I had been introduced to the trance-personalities in\nmy own name. After some other talk, MyerSp wrote :\nMrs S. my dear good friend did you understand my reference\nto library 1\nE. M. S. To the Gurney Library ?\n^\nYes.\nE. M. S. I did not understand it well.\nI wdll explain as we understand each other better. My\nreference to another light explains my understanding hex-\nmessage.\nFurther conversation follows and he then continues :\nDo you remember my reference to my old friend, which\nwas-\u2014I long to meet him again. It would be joy.\nWhose warm sympathetic encouragement kept my pen\nin motion so to speak\u2014from being idle.\nI see you a little clearer now.\nDo you recall my saying I would rather it be myself than\nhim ? I said this to you just before he came.\nCan you recall my reference to your\u2014to a document\nwhich concerned you after our good friend left 1\nAnd you said it did not matter so long as you gave the\nlibrary. I thought it a good suggestion, as it would\nserve as a memoriam [sic].\n(Eector communicating)\nHe wishes to know if you understand (E.)\n^This was said in ignorance of the fact that J. G. P. had asked MyerSp to\nstate what particular library had been referred to by Myersv- I believe, too,\nthat while I knew that \u201clibrary\u201d had been referred to in both scripts, I had\nnot realised that the Gurney library had been mentioned in Mrs Verrall\u2019s\nonly.\n\f428 Mrs. Henry Sidgiuiclc. [part\nE. M. S. I do not understand very well. I do not remember about\nthe library.\n(Myers communicating)\nDont you remember a letter I wrote to you about it before\nI went away and you replied that you thought my\nsuggestion a good one ?\nThe \u201c Library \u201d and the \u201c document \u201d seem here to be dis-\nsociated from the conversation at Terling. I can make nothing\nof them and have no letters throwing light on them. At\nthe next sitting at which I was present\u2014February 20\n\u2014\nthe library was again referred to. Myersj^, urged me to look\nagain for a letter referring to it and said :\n\u201c I distinctly\nremember writing you or talking with you and I believe I\nwrote about adding some of your own books to the College\nLibrary.\u201d I do not think it likely that Mr Myers and I\neither talked or corresponded on this subject ;\nand certainly\nif it had been mentioned between us, it would not have been\nin a way to make any particular impression on either of us.\nThe only reference to the Terling conversation at this sitting\nwas the following remark by MyerSp :\n\u2014\u201c I am most anxious to\nget my answer to you with deep sincere and coherent\nmeaning.\u201d\nThe next time it was referred to was on March 20, when\nI was for the first time having a sitting with Mrs Piper with\nno one else present. I had, since February 20, taken charge\nof several sittings, but there had always been another sitter\nwith whom it was intended that the trance-personalities should\nconverse. On March 20 Myersp appeared almost immediately\nand wished to know if I remembered his making a suggestion\nto me once about a will. This I suppose is a development\nof the document idea of previous sittings. I thought I remem-\nbered something vaguely about his own intentions as to some\nof his property and said :\n\u201c I think I remember something\nabout it.\u201d He continued :\nI recall very clearly speaking with you about a will and as\nI recall it it had to do with our good friend Sidgwick.\nE. M. S. I think we talked about his will.\nI think I was rather interested and pleased.\n\flvil] An Incident in Mrs. Piper\u2019s Trance. 429\nIt is likely enough that we spoke of the will on some\noccasion between the death of my husband and that of Mr.\nMyers ;\nbut it was a will of no general interest, as it simply\nleft everything to me. The subject then dropped and a little\nlater in the sitting MyerSp said\n:\nLet me ask you if you recall my affectionate conversation ^\nwhen I visited you at Tarling [sic],- which I had forgotten\nabout.\nE. M. S. Yes I remember.\nYes and my advising you to see about \u2014see [illegible\nscrawl here] about his life.\nE. M. S. \u201cMy advising you to see\u201d?\n(Eector, communicating)\nI can\u2019t tell you just what that word is. It sounds like\nR e V n u a \u00ae of his life R.\nE. M. S. R, e, u, n, u, a ;\nis that it ?\n(Myers communicating)\nYes. It was to write it.\nE. M. S. \u201cTo write it\u201d? Yes I remember.\nYes, I mean where I saw you and called you out.\nE. M. S. Yes, quite right.\nIt gave me the greatest pain of my whole life,'^ yet in\nanother sense the greatest joy. Do you understand my\nmeaning ? I was grieved to lose my friend ;\nI felt it\nwould be a loss ;\nbut felt that his loss would be his gain.\n^This word is not clear. I read ifc \u201cconversation\u201d at the time I believe,\nbnt if it is \u201c conversation\u201d it is very much abbreviated. It may be \u201c emotion.\u201d\n\u00aeThis is the first time the name appears in the script, and it is spelt\nas a person might spell it who had only heard it \u2014not seen it written.\n^Perhaps a cross between Eeview and Memoir; compare \u201cremery\u201d (p. 424,\nfootnote), which may have been a cross between remember and memory. Mrs\nPiper had, I believe, had in her hands the number of the Proceedings published\nin February, 1907, containing Mr Podmore\u2019s review of the Memoir.\n^This, of course, is not true of Mr Myers, and, moreover, he regarded the\nseparation as likely to be brief ; but it is fair perhaps to take it as merely a\nrhetorical exaggeration.\n\f430 Mrs. Henry Sidgiuick. [part\nE. M. S. Yes, I quite understand. Can you remember what you\nsaid about writing his life ?\nI do veiy clearly. I remember referring to some letters and\ncollecting them.\nE. M. S. Yes, I daresay you did say that.\nBut it was to my mind the most valuable and interesting\nthing either you or I could do. Do you remember this 1\nE. M. S. I remember.!\nAnd you said you would give it your best thought.\nE. M. S. Yes.\nDid it ever seem to you that I should not survive to help\nyou with it 1\nE. M. S. I remember that you said that.\"\nI have survived and so has he.\nSome remarks about my husband follow here, and a message\nfrom him. Then I said :\nE. M. S. May I ask another question, Mr Myers 1\nDo talk with me dear Mrs Sidgwick. I long to have you\nspeak with me, it is my hope and my joy.\nE. M. S. You have remembered very well about that conversation,\nbut you said something else about the writing of that\nLife. Will 3'ou think it over and tell me if jmu can\nwhat it was 1\nDid you say think it overl\nE. M. S. Yes, I said think it over.\nYes I will gladly go over it in my thoughts, and finish my\nrecollections when I meet jmu again.\nDuring the waking stage after this sitting Mrs Piper\nreferred several times to \u201c Arthur \u201d and an \u201c Eleanor,\u201d who\ndo not really i-emember his saying anything e.xactly like that, hut he did\nthink it very important that the Life should he written.\n-Here, again, my answer is not exactly true. He hoped to help with the\nLife more or less, though he did not expect to live long enough to write it\nhimself, in addition to finishing his own hook.\n\fLVii.] An Incident in Mrs. Pij>ers Trance. 431\nworked or talked too hard, to whom he was to give a rest.\n\u201c What is that man with a long beard ? Arthur must give\nEleanor a rest ;\nshe talked too hard ;\nI was afraid that she\nwould suffer.\u201d At one point the name \u201c Henry \u201d wms apparently\nassociated with the others. This collocation of names\u2014my\nbrother-in-law\u2019s, my own, and my husband\u2019s\u2014and the implica-\ntion of some kind of co-operation between Arthur and Eleanor\nsuggests that Arthur Sidgwick was the Arthur referred to,\u2019-\nand that we have here a first emergence of the idea of his\nhelping with the biography. On the other hand, there was\nno appropriateness in speaking of a need of rest in connection\nwith me ;\nand the remark, \u201c she\u2019s a bright girl \u201d, which was\nassociated with the overworked person, obviously cannot apply\nto me. As will be seen presently, however, Arthur Sidgwick\u2019s\ndaughter is said at the next sitting to be \u201c a very bright\ngirl.\u201d This suggests some confusion of ideas. Is it possible\nthere is a further confusion between the ideas of Arthur\nSidgwick having little leisure for w'riting (see p. 418) and my\nbeing overworked ? It is perhaps worth noting that I had\nMr Arthur Sidgwick in my mind on March 20, not only\nin connection with the Terling conversation, but because I had\njust arranged for him to sit with Mrs Piper in the following\nweek. These sittings did not come off, because Mrs Piper was\nill, and he was unable to avail himself of a later opportunity.\nOn April 2 I again sat alone with Mrs Piper. Her\nillness had prevented any sittings taking place in the interval.\nMyersp soon appeared, and, after a few remarks about another\ntopic, said :\nDo you remember my reference to you at Tarling [sic] about\nmy -writing of the life of our blessed friend ?\nE. M. S. Yes.\nI recall cpiite distinctly my own impressions of what should\nbe done and was cjuite willing to undertake the task\nmyself, but you will remember at that time I was\novercrowded with work and made the suggestion that\nyou should collect certain letters etc. for this purpose.\nDo you recall it yourself 1\n\u2019A man with a long beard wouhl describe either Henry or Arthur Sidgwick,\nbut I do not know of any instance of Mrs Pqjer seeing, during tiie waking-\nstage, absent living persons.\n\f432 [part\nMrs. Henry Sidgwick.\nE. M. fS. Yes, I recall it4\nI should be glad if you could recall the act (1) of our\nwalking out in the garden ;\nand I said it would be to\nmy mind the most valuable tribute we could pay to him\nand his memor}'.\nE. M. S. Yes, I know you thought so, Mr Myers,\nBesides I believe I offered to give you any help I could.\nE. M. S. Yes, jmu did.\nI also had in mind and I believe I gave utterance to it that\nafter such (?) work (?) should have been accomplished the\nreceipts should go to further a cause in which we were both\ninterested.\nE. M. S. I do not remember your saying that.\nI am not sure that I did not apply this to my own\nwork instead. My memory is fairly clear regarding the\nactual facts and my feelings. I also referred to a\nphotograph at one time, or photographs appropriate for\nreproduction.\nE. M. S. Yes, you did.\nWhich seemed to meet with your approval at once.\nE. M. S. Yes, we agreed at once.\n[This choice of a photograph was for his own obituary\nnotice of my husband in the S.P.E. Proceedings. The\nphotograph b}^ Mrs Myers which is there reproduced\nwas agreed on by Mr and Mrs Myers and myself at\ntheir house.]\nI also remember making reference to his simplicity and\nearnestness in his life\u2019s work which should be brought\nout. And do you remember my deep and tender emotion\nwhen I referred to the help he had given me ?\nE. M. S. Yes, I do well.\nI live with him to appreciate and enjoy his kindness devotion\nand encouragement as I did when visible to you.\nDo you remember my suggesting also that this should be\ndone as soon as possible ?\n\u2018 I do not really recall, however, his making any suggestion about letters.\n\f433\nLVii.] An Incident in Mrs. Piper's Trance.\nE. M. S Yes.i\nTo which 3'ou acquiesced. And now let me collect my\nthoughts and continue.\nIMyerSp then retired to reappear after an interval during which\nHodgsoup had been conversing. On returning he first attempted\nto \u201c go back to old memories \u201d\n\u2014some of which agree more or less\nwith my recollections, but are not evidential\u2014and then said\n:\nNow dear friend let us refer again to the book.\nE. M. S. Yes I want you to refer to the book.\nI remember I asked you to try, and do you remember copy\nright, and bring out the work that it should not fall into\nother hands. I felt it was your work [or, book(?)] alone\nand the exact words I pointed were I believe like this\n\u2014\nI hade?) unless you take certain (?) on this point they would\nlose their value. Am I not correct ?\nE. M. S. I do not think jmu referred to cop}wight.-\nI do not intend to say copy right, only copies. Rector does\nnot understand my point ;\nI will explain.\nDo jmu remember my suggesting to jmu about views (?)\nphotographs which I thought would be necessary ? And\nI think I suggested Arthur. Do you remember about\nArthur and what I said about his giving anything (?) to\nassist assisting j'ou.\nE. M. S. Yes, cpiite well.\nAnd if you gave it your attention it would be splendid and\njust what I should so much like.\nE. M. S. Yes, you did want Arthur to help.\nYes, 1 did ask you to get him to help you.\nE. M. S. Yes, you did.\nI remember it well.\nE. M. S. Yes, that was one thing you talked about at Terling.\nYes it was the chief thing.\nE. M. S. It was.\nAnd as you asked me the question I felt it my bounden\n1 Again not a specific recollection on my part, but it doubtless was what he\ndesired.\nThere may, again, be some confusion with his own book here.\n\f434 Mrs. Henry Sidgiviclc. [part\ndut}' to reply in such a way as to convince you that I\nhad not forgotten our meeting and our talk [walk (?)] in\nthe garden where I suggested it.\nE. M. S. I am very glad you have remembered.\nI said I knew of no one more capable than he was to carry\nout my suggestion. Now did you ever do it?\nK M. S. Yes, I did do it.\nOh I am glad to hear it.\nI remember Arthur had a daughter,^ but I can\u2019t tell her name\nat the moment. Is he [or she(?)] all right?\npy M. S. Yes, he is veiy well.\nVery bright girl, and capable, I remember. Well have I\nanswered all about that ? I think I have answered all\nabout our talk ;\nI believe I have covered everything of\nimportance.\nPI M .S. Yes, much the most important things.\nYes. If not please remind me of something I am to think\nover.\nOn the next occasion when I was at a sitting alone\u2014April\n8 \u2014there was a good deal of scrappy reference to things said\non previous occasions, an indication probably that communication\nwas not going easily. Among other matters Myersp referred\nto the Terling conversation as follows\n:\nDid you understand what I said about Arthur ?\nAnd my suggestion about the photograi>hs ?\np]. M. 8. About the photographs ?\nOf my good friend.\n^\n^ Arthur Sidgwick lias three daughters, but I think Mr Myers liad a more\nvivid acquaintance with one than with the others.\n2 There was at this sitting a similar brief recurrence to the \u201clibrary,\u201d Init in a\nnew form. Thus :\n(Myers communicating)\nDo you remember what I said about the College library.\nE.M.S. No, there was a cross-correspondence about it though.\nYes, but I believe I wrote you about my intention of giving some of lay\nbooks to our Society.\nE.M.S. Perhaps you did.\nYou seemed pleased. I remember.\nE.M.S. I have forgotten.\n\fLVii.] An Incident in Mrs. Piim^'s Trance. 435\nIt is difficult to know whether we ouoht to infer from this\nthat MyerSp conceived Arthur Sidgwick\u2019s assistance to be required\nchiehy for the purpose of choosing photographs. His name came\nin close connection with the selection of photographs at the\nsitting of April 2, but the part MyerSp assigned to him then\ncertainly seemed more important. It is possible here to regard\n\u201c what I said about Arthur,\u201d and \u201c my suggestion about photo-\ngraphs \u201d as references to two separate points, especially as they\ndo not run on in the script ;\nthe second has a paragraph to\nitself. This does not, however, always imply an independent\nsentence in the script ;\nand at the sitting I certainly supposed\nthat Arthur and the photographs were connected. I believe that\nthere was in consequence a surprised intonation in my question\n\u2014\u201c About the photographs \u201d ?\u2014which I indicated in the record\nby underlining the last word ;\nbut if so, it led to no attempt\nto remove my surprise.\nThe last reference at the London sittings to the Terling\nconversation was on April 30\u2014when I was not present.\nMrs Verrall was the sitter, and had been explaining another\nquestion she wished MyerSp to answer. He said in reply to her\nexplanation :\nOh yes I think I understand now. It was a long time before\nI understood about Terling [sic] the home of Lady Lay-\nleigh. Tailing [.sic] where Mrs Sidgwick and I talked.\nThis concludes the narrative of what occurred. It remains\nto examine whether the episode affords evidence either of memory\ncontinuous with that of Mr Myers, or of any other kind of\nsupernormally acquired knowledge. As an experiment in\nobtaining from MyerSp evidence that he knew something\nunknown to the sitter, it was, of course, a complete failure, but\nknowledge of which I believe myself to have been the sole\nliving repository was shown. Was it extracted from me by\nguessing and fishing ? Was it obtained from me telepathically ?\nThese are the questions to be considered and answered as far\nas possible. But first we must examine what the knowledge to\nbe accounted for amounts to. It must, of course, be assumed\nthat Mrs Piper was aware that my brother-in-law Arthur\nSidgwick and I had together produced a Memoir of my husband ;\nand the apparent ignorance of this shown by MyerSp (see p. 434),\n\f436 Mrs. Henry Sidgtvick. [part\nthough curious and perhaps instructive, cannot be regarded as\nevidence one way or the other for our present purpose. The\nfurther facts\u2014that a conversation between Mr Myers and\nmyself took place at Terling, the home of Lord Eayleigh, very\nshortly before my husband\u2019s death, and that in that conversa-\ntion Mr Myers spoke to me on two specific subjects, both of\nwhich involved action on my part\u2014were the data the trance\npersonality had to work upon. What Myersp contributed was\n{a) that our conversation took place out of doors, (b) that it\nconcerned the writing of a biography of my husband, (c) that\nMr Myers being very anxious that it should be written, but (d)\nnot feeling able to lurdertake to write it himself on account of\npressure of other work, (c) asked me to get Arthur Sidgwick\nto help with it. It must be observed, however, that what Mr\nMyers really proposed was that I should ask Arthur Sidgwick\nto vjritc it. That he should co-operate with me in writing it\nwas my own desire.\nThis information came out piecemeal\u2014not all at once. Fact\n(a) was given to Mrs Verrall (to whom it was, as we have seen,\nknown) on January 22 (see p. 417). It might have been a\nguess, as the place out of doors was not clearly specified and the\nnumber of probable alternative answers to the questions put by\nMrs Verrall was not large. At the same time it was a first\nshot, and as such hits the mark more nearly than a guess by a\nperson unacquainted with the circumstances would have been\nlikely to do. Any conversation I had alone with Mr Myers\nwhile he was at Terling\u2014in other words, any conversation with\nhim alone within a few weeks of my husband\u2019s death\u2014probably\ntook place out of doors. The weather was very fine, there\nwere lots of places in the garden and shrubberies to sit and\nstroll in, and it was very easy to step out of the house into the\ngarden. One was naturally out of doors when not specially\noccrrpied indoors.\nFact (b) (that the conversation concerned the writing of a\nMemoir) was the first definite statement about the Terling\nconversation made to myself The previous guesses\u2014a sealed\nenvelope, a work to be brought out (p. 421)\\ a document,\n'\nIt has been pointed out to me that it is conceivable that this was a first\napproach to the real subject of the conversation rather than a mere guess\u2014as it\nmight refer to the autobiographical fragment written at Mr Myers\u2019s suggestion\n\fLVii.] An Incident in Mrs. Piper\u2019s Trance. 437\nH college matter (p. 424), library (if we are to count this\nas a guess)\u2014were given to IMrs Yerrall or i\\Ir Piddington\n;\nand before fact (b) was mentioned MyerSp had had sufficient\nmeans of learninQ that none of them was right. Indeed\n\u201c library \u201d and \u201c document \u201d had been referred to by him in my\npresence (pp. 427-8), not, it is true, as connected with the\nconversation, but in a way which would have given me an oppor-\ntunity of accepting them as so connected, had they been the\nsubjects in question. Fact {h) itself came out with the provok-\ning want of perfect clearness so general in the communications.\nPiector\u2019s inability to catch a word which should havo been\n\u201c memoir,\u201d or an equivalent, gave MyerSp an opportunity, had he\nneeded it, of developing the idea in some different way and of\ndenying that it was a biography that was to be written. If I\nhad not a little later somewhat unguardedly accepted the\ninterpretation in an unequivocal manner, he might have found\nit necessary to put out further feelers. Such a cautious\nprocedure is characteristic of automatism generally, as well as\nof Mrs Piper\u2019s in particular, and seems to arise from a dislike of\nbeing found in the wrong which also leads to bad excuses and\nelaborate false explanations of erroneous statements. So\ndefinite a statement so inartistically backed out of as that about\ncopy-right on p. 433 is, I think, unusual. This kind of cautious\napproach to a statement is no doubt often useful for \u201c fishing\n\u201d\n\u2014\ni.e. extracting from the sitter himself the information desired\n\u2014\nbut it is equally liable to occur when \u2022 an automatist is alone\nand fishing is out of the question. There is therefore no need\nto assume that fishing was intended on the occasion under\ndiscussion, nor indeed that the inability to bring out the word\n\u201c memoir \u201d was feigned. I have no doubt that Eector does\nsometimes feign inability to catch what the spirit alleged to\nbe using him as amanuensis is saying.^ But though this habit\nmakes one suspicious, I do not think the present case really looks\nlike either such feigned inability, or fishing, or even like a\n(see p. 418). But from an evidential point of view this possibility seems hardly\nworth considering.\n' When, for instance. Rector says he cannot catch the letters of the alphabet\nforming a name which a deceased friend of the sitter is spelling out to him, it\ncan hardly be doubted that what is going on is an attempt, whether deliberate or\nnot, to get the information from the sitter.\n\f438 Mrs. Henry Sidywick. [part\ncautious approach to the subject. The idea of the Memoir,\neven without the word, is I think more clearly expressed\nthan it would have been if ambiguity had been intended.\nIt seems more likely that the automatic personality really had\nfor the moment forgotten the word, as we are all liable to\ndo occasionally, and as apparently happened in the present\nseries of sittings not only with difficult words like \u201c La\nSaisiaz \u201d and \u201c Vogler \u201d (see pp. 367-8, and 373), but with\nthe word \u201cscale\u201d (pp. 388-391).\nI therefore think that MyerSp did specify the writing of a\nMemoir of my husband as the subject of the conversation without\nassistance, unless it was telepathic a.ssistance, from me. Moreover\nit does not seem to me likely that a person knowing no more\nabout it than Mrs Piper, would think this a probable subject of\nconversation under the given circumstances ;\nso that regarded\nas a mere guess it would be a remarkably fortunate one, even\nallowing for the deduction that must be made on account of\nthe previous attempts.\nThe successful statement of facts (c) (that Mr Myers was\nanxious that the biography should be written, pp, 430 and 432)\nand (d) (that he did not himself feel able to undertake it owing\nto pressure of other work, p. 431) must, 1 think, be held to add to\nthe improbability of the whole being mere guess work, notwith-\nstanding the admixture of irrelevant remarks about photographs\n(pp. 432, 433, and 434), copyright (p. 433), and the assignment\nof profits to a special object (p. 432). At the same time it\nmust be borne in mind that (c) is a natural inference from\nthe already admitted fact that Mr Myers talked about the\nMemoir at such a moment ;\nand as to (d) that it is not\nimprobable that Dr Hodgson had talked with the trance-\npersonalities about Mr Myers\u2019s desire to finish his own book\nbefore he died.\nFact (e) that Mr Myers asked me in that conversation to get\nArthur Sidgwick to help is, I think, more improbable as a guess\nor inference. It must, as I have said, be assumed that Mrs\nPiper was aware that he did co-operate, but I do not think it at\nall naturally follows from this that Mr Myers was likely to have\nbeen concerned in the matter in any way. MyerSp must be\ncredited, too, for what it is worth, both with the naturalness\nand the unambiguity of the Christian name Arthur used by\n\flvil] An Incident in Mrs. Piper\u2019s Trance. 439\nitself.\u2019- Mr Myers, who was an old College friend of Arthur\nSidgwick\u2019s, called him simply \u201cArthur\u201d in speaking to him,\nor to me of him ;\nand after his own brother Arthur died there\nwas no living Arthur of whom he would have been likely\nto speak to me without further description. \u201c Arthur \u201d when\nused by Mr Myers by itself in speaking to me meant Arthur\nSidgwick. The statement that \u201c Arthur had a daughter\n\u201d\n(p. 434) is a further true and distinctive statement so far as\nit goes.\nIn conclusion, then, I think that, after making full allowance\nfor erroneous guesses and for piecemeal emergence of the state-\nments made, the amount of apparent knowledge shown was\ndecidedly beyond what could be expected to occur by chance,\nand in forming a judgement it must of course be remembered that\nthe statements were made in answer to a C[uestion selected by\nme, not by the trance-personalities. Xo one incident\u2014even a\nmore striking one than thi.s\u2014can by itself prove supernormal\naccess to information, but this incident does in my opinion add\nto the weight in that scale.\nAs regards the source from which MyerSp obtained the know-\nledge\u2014whether it was from my mind or the memory of Mr\nMyers\u2014there is no conclusive indication in the incident.\nThought-transference from me is obviously not excluded, and\ntherefore unless and until communication from the dead is\nestablished as a vera causa, thoimht-transference must hold the\nground. But supposing that thought-transference from the dead\nand from the living were known to be equally probable in\nthemselves, which should we suppose to have operated in the\npresent case ? I think it is difficult to say. The main con-\nsiderations are on the one side that the trance-personality itself\nassumes that the information came from the dead, and on the\nother that it did not come at all except in the presence of a\nliving person who possessed it, and then more in accordance\nwith that person\u2019s views than Mr Myers\u2019s (see p. 436). It\nmay perhaps be urged that I, the living person, had not\npreviously shown any power as a telepathic agent. But this\ncannot count for much, for I had not previously succeeded in\n^ It is the more important to mention this because Mrs Piper in trance,\nand other automatists, are apt to bring out Christian names alone in a way\nthat is ambiguous and not natural.\n\f440 3Irs.

Some new\ncondition must therefore have been introduced in tlie present\ncase, and there is no more difficulty in supposing this to be the\nbreaking down of some barrier between my mind and j\\Irs Piper\u2019s\nwhich makes telepathy now possible, than in supposing any other-\nchange in the psychical relations between us.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nINDEX TO VOL.
