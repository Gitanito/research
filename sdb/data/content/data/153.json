His targets included parapsychology, alternative health treatments, religion-based pseudoscience and cult movements. He co-founded the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims for the Paranormal (now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry) and is considered a leading figure of the modern sceptical movement. &nbsp;   Contents   \tLife and Career \tBeliefs \tParanormal Critiques \tSelected Books \tPraise \tCriticism and Controversy \tLiterature \tEndnotes     Life and Career\n\nMartin Gardner was born 21 October in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA. His father, James Henry Gardner,&nbsp;a geologist and independent oil producer, taught him basic science and set up a small laboratory for him.1 He became interested in magic in elementary school.\n\nGardner\u2019s main interests in high school were mathematics and physics. He planned to earn a physics degree at the California Institute of Technology, but entrance required two years at a liberal arts college, so instead he studied philosophy at the University of Chicago, earning a baccalaureate. During the end of the Depression period he worked as a social caseworker for the Chicago Relief Administration, then studied on a scholarship at the Chicago Theological Seminary.\n\nGardner decided to become a writer and worked briefly as a reporter in Tulsa. He then returned to the University of Chicago to work in its press relations office, mostly writing science research press releases. He also edited Comment, the university\u2019s literary magazine, and was part of the Chicago magicians\u2019 community. During World War II he served in the Navy for four years, mostly in writing and public relations jobs; after his service he began selling short stories, then moved to New York City and worked for eight years for a children\u2019s magazine. In 1956 he published an article in Scientific American; this led to a regular column entitled Mathematical Games, which he wrote for 25 years.\n\nGardner authored many books, most of them on popular mathematics, puzzles, games and brain teasers (a full bibliography may be found here) as well as columns, articles and reviews in popular publications. He never performed magic publicly, but invented tricks and wrote extensively on the topic. He continued writing until his death at the age of 95.  Beliefs\n\nGardner\u2019s mother was a devout Methodist; he viewed his father, nominally a Christian, as a pantheist. In his teens he was attracted to atheism by Thomas Paine\u2019s Age of Reason, but in his final high school year he embraced what he calls \u2018a crude form of Protestant fundamentalism\u2019,2 attending the First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa. He had a short flirtation with Seventh-Day Adventism after a book by Adventist geologist George McReady Price convinced him the world was 10,000 years old and another book convinced him that the Second Coming was imminent. He again lost his faith after reading an expos\u00e9 on the massive plagiarism committed by a co-founder of the sect in writing its scripture. In university, he decided he could not call himself a Christian when he did not believe that Jesus was God incarnate or that the miracles described in the Bible were possible.\n\nGardner eventually settled on philosophical theism. \u2018I managed to retain faith in a personal God and a hope for an afterlife\u2019,3 he wrote, but added that he was certain that there were no proofs for either and that his beliefs in them were emotionally based. He considered that the puzzle of how the brain produces consciousness is ultimately insoluble.  Paranormal Critiques\n\nGardner first came across articles criticizing pseudoscience in Hugo Gernsback\u2019s magazine Science and Invention. His first article on the topic, \u2018The Hermit Scientist\u2019, was published in the Antioch Review in 1950, and tackled Scientology, UFOs, George McCready Price\u2019s creationist geology, Wilhelm Reich\u2019s orgone therapy and others.4\n\nUpon reading \u2018The Hermit Scientist\u2019, a high-school friend and literary agent suggested Gardner expand it into a book. In the Name of Science was published by Putnam in 1952. It attracted little notice until it was republished by Dover in 1957 with the title Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, when it became one of the company\u2019s top sellers. The book attacked UFOs, dowsing, Atlantis, Lemuria, naturopathy, chiropractic, Edgar Cayce and other unconventional healers, vegetarianism, organic farming, anthrosophy, psychodrama, palmistry, graphology, JB Rhine, Upton Sinclair, unconventional sexual theories, the Bridey Murphy reincarnation case, and many other topics.\n\nIn 1975, Gardner wrote a short satirical book under the pseudonym \u2018Uriah Fuller\u2019 entitled Confessions of a Psychic, poking fun at the celebrity psychic Uri Geller. In 1976, he co-founded the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, CSI) with Paul Kurtz, James Randi and Marcello Truzzi.5\n\nIn 1983, Gardner started writing a regular column for CSICOP\u2019s magazine, the Skeptical Inquirer, entitled \u2018Notes of a Psi-Watcher\u2019 and later retitled \u2018Notes of a Fringe-Watcher\u2019, continuing to contribute until 2002. These columns, alongside similar essays and reviews written for other publications such as the New York Times, New York Review of Books and Discover, were collected into a series of books, several of them published by Prometheus Books. He also edited The Wreck of the Titanic Foretold? (1986), a collection of writings that apparently portend the ship\u2019s sinking, accompanied by critical notes.\n\nGardner wrote one paper for the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research, responding to Swiss psychic Silvio Meyer\u2019s claim to have created a permanent paranormal object (PPO) by passing a foil frame into the centre of a sheet of paper by a slit which he then \u2018healed\u2019. Gardner gave instructions for constructing an object with the same property by making the paper from a mixture of paper fibres and water.6  Selected Books\n\nFads and Fallacies in the Name of Science (1957) New York: Dover.

Praise\n\nGardner is regarded by psi-sceptics as a founder of the modern sceptical movement, some tracing its origins to his 1952 book Fads and Fallacies In the Name of Science. Michael Shermer credits his writings with pushing the sceptical movement to the forefront of public consciousness.7 Biologist and author Stephen Jay Gould called him \u2018the single brightest beacon defending rationality and good science against the mysticism and anti-intellectualism that surrounds us.8\n\nGardner is considered one of \u2018ten outstanding skeptics\u2019 in an article in Skeptical Inquirer, in a list which also includes Harry Houdini, Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein. He is one of 27 scientists, scholars, writers and investigators honoured in 2011 in the CSI\u2019s Pantheon of Skeptics.  Criticism and Controversy\n\nGardner\u2019s attacks on parapsychology have been characterized by practitioners as \u2018laden with insults, innuendos and emotionally-toned phrases\u2019.9 JL Randall writes: \u2018I should feel much more confidence in Gardner's criticisms if he would (a) confine himself to a properly objective scientific analysis of the experiments, and (b) submit his conclusions for publication in the scientific literature, rather than propagandist periodicals such as The Humanist.\u201910 Nancy Zingrone writes that most of his work \u2018contains statements in which the parapsychological community is battered rhetorically by a brandishment of idealized scientific norms and misconceptions of scientific practice in prose that fairly drips with moral indignation.\u201911\n\nGardner is criticized for deliberately confusing serious and popular parapsychology as a means of discrediting the former. \u2018Gardner draws comparisons, for example, between the psychic DD Home and the illusionist Uri Geller; between Geller\u2019s na\u00efve investigators and Jule Eisenbud; between Peter Phillips \u2026 and Robert Morris; between William Crookes and Arthur Conan Doyle.\u201912\n\nIn a review of Gardner\u2019s book-length critique of psychic Pavel Stepanek, John Beloff pointed out that for an individual to submit to scientific scrutiny over many years with the intention merely of duping investigators would amount to psychopathic behaviour, yet he exhibited no independent evidence of this. Beloff added:  \n\nIt seems the author simply cannot restrain himself from lashing out recklessly at various paranormal claims which he regards as having been exploded but which in fact are still wide open to discussion \u2026 even before Gardner entered the fray, the data from this case was no longer necessary to establish the case for ESP. One can only suppose, therefore, that the reason why Gardner went to all the trouble of writing this book was not so much to demolish Stepanek as to discredit parapsychologists.13\n\nIn another review of the same book, parapsychologist J\u00fcrgen Keil writes, \u2018The whole purpose of his book is to misrepresent a period of careful research\u2019.14 Keil makes a strong supporting case for Stepanek, in the course of which he exposes factual errors by Gardner.\n\nMilan Ryzl, the main experimenter with Stepanek, revealed that Gardner had written to Stepanek suggesting that Stepanek \u2018write an article or give an interview in which he would reveal how he cheated\u2019. Gardner offered to help publicize such a report and, further, to produce a documentary film \u2018that would make him at once internationally famous and at the same time enable him to receive substantial honoraria\u2019.15\n\nIn a paper on the role of magicians in parapsychological research,16 WE Cox reports a discussion with Gardner about Uri Geller\u2019s psychokinetic effect on his keys and watch.  \n\nMy replies re the watch yielded only presumptuous reactions. His \u2018proposed non-psi hypothesis\u2019 was patently simplistic \u2026 This watch was both double-backed and sealed. Not a single conceivable normal cause has been cited (Gardner\u2019s does not qualify, being ad hominem) in the decade since it occurred.17\n\nGeorge P Hansen observed that, where psi research was concerned, Gardner attacked individuals who claimed to possess psychic gifts rather than the ordinary people who were the subjects in most psi testing. Hansen further pointed out that Gardner lacked an advanced degree and was not trained in experimental science and noted that since his writings were mostly published in books and magazines rather than peer-reviewed academic journals, they contained significant statistical errors.\n\nExploring Gardner\u2019s motives, Hansen cites the essay \u2018Science: Why I Am Not a Paranormalist\u201918 in which Gardner admits to fear of telepathy and clairvoyance as a danger to personal privacy, and of psychokinesis as carrying the threat of harm. Hansen sees a religious motive also, suggesting that Gardner\u2019s objection to parapsychological research relates to a wish to maintain a border between science and the divine, which he considered&nbsp;should not be tested, being a matter of faith: in his eyes, parapsychologists are committing a sin.19\n\nFor further criticisms by Gardner and rebuttals by others, see:   \tHenry Gross (American dowser) \tDermo-Optical Perception) \tLeonora Piper (medium) \tTed Serios (thoughtography) \tArigo (Brazilian psychic healer)\n\nKM Wehrstein  Literature\n\nBeloff, J.
