Though the \ufb05ars, by their motion in the hea\nVens, alternately change their con\ufb05itutions, and\nhave a determinate degree of inten\u017fion, and a de\ufb01\nnite quantity of exten\ufb01on of their light, they do\nnot\n\fELEMBNTARY PHILOSOPHY. is;\nnot act upon tho\u017fe in\u017fei'iors, aceording to the true\nand real inten\u017fion and exten\u017fion of that light\nwhich they have in common, but only according to\nthe apparent ;in re\u017fpect of which they join tho\u017fe\npa\u017f\u017fable bodies : \u017for this rea\u017fon, the \u017ftars act upon\nthe \u017fublunaries only according to that degree of in\nten\u017fion, and quality of exten\u017fion of\u00felight, by which\nthey are united to the \ufb05ars, as from things \u017fub\njected ;the le\u017fs are inten\u017fion and extention; but their\naction is the \u017fame, with re\u017fpect to that exten\u017fion\nto which they are oppo\u017fite ; aswe very plainly ex\nperience in the 1) . They in\ufb02uence according to the\n\ufb01ruation and parahola\u017fe to the pa\u017f\u017fuble \u017fubject. Invi\n\u017fihle eclip\u017fes have no in\ufb02uence or \u017furpri\u017fmg pheno\nmena; they act only upon tho\u017fe provinces in\nwhich they are \u017feen : \u017fo th\ufb01t the \ufb05ars, where they\ndo not ri\u017fe, are inactive.\n5. The \ufb05ars are indeed the univer\u017fal cau\u017fe, and\nindeterminate, as to their \u017fpeci\ufb01c and individual e\u017f\n\u017fects; but are determined according to the variety\no\u017f the pa\u017f\u017fable \u017fubjects and neare\ufb05 cau\u017fes: as the\no melts wax, drys up the mud, whitens it,\nblackensthe human \u017fkin, with man produces man,\na lion with a lion, &e.\n6. The \ufb05ars cannot be the \u017figns of e\ufb00ects, i\u017fthey\nare not al\u017fo the cau\u017fes; wherefore interrogations,\nin the manner o\u017f the ancients, have no place in na\nture, unle\u017fs perhaps in eminent e\ufb00ects, inwhich they\nmove the approximate cau\u017fe o\u017f natural e\ufb00ects;\nthey al\u017fo move the parts, organs and members o\u017f the\n, ' pa\u017f\u017fable\n\f,zs A s T K o N o at'v A N D\npa\u017f\u017fahle \u017fubject in the \u017fcetus; they re\u017fpect the pa\ntents, \u017fex, number, \ufb01gure, &e. The pre\u017fent \ufb05ate of\nthe planets approaches to the actual e\ufb00ect, according\nto a pre-ordinate and pre-exi\ufb05ent power, and there\nfore they are the cau\u017fe or con-cau\u017fe, not barely\n\u017figns, but the con\ufb05ellations, which for the pre\u017fent\nbring their e\ufb00ects to act, are the \u017fame as the cau\u017fes\no\u017f pre-ordinarion ;and \u017fo o\u017f death, &c. For unlike\ncau\u017fes cannot 'Drink to act the di\ufb03mulas pro-exi\ufb05\ning, according to the power of the e\ufb00ects.\n7. And \u017fince, to di\ufb05ingui\u017fh and know the e\ufb00ects\no\u017f any \ufb05ar, it is nece\u017f\u017fary to know the di\ufb00erence,\nnature and order o\u017f tho\u017fe e\ufb00ects, according to the\n\u017fonnde\ufb05 philo\u017fophy; after laying down the \ufb01r\ufb05\nprinciple o\u017fall'things, Matter, and \u017fub\ufb05antial, from\nthe primary and compound qualities, We di\ufb05in\ngui\u017fh all the\u017fe into two principal kinds, viz. into\nthe pa\ufb03ve or feminine, and the actiVe or ma\u017fcu\nline. To the \ufb01r\ufb05 \u017fort, we again call in matter\nand quantity, or quality, \u017fo \u017far as it is pa\ufb03ve,\nwith all the other qualities which are derived from\nits moi\ufb05ure, dryne\u017fs, rarity, deu\u017fxty, lightne\u017fs, &e.\nFor the ma\u017fculine \u017fort, \u017fub\ufb05antial and material;\nfrom \u017fmell, \u017found, the active virtue of the com\npound, &c.\n8. Vr'e call commixion a union o\u017f altered mi\u017fci\nbles, but we add, perfected by the e\ufb03cient of the\n\u017fuperiors, Order and Nature, that is, by a cele\ufb01ial\nquality, on which the connection o\u017f tho\u017fe mi\u017fcibles\ndepends; whence the compounds, which have a\n' larger\ni\n\fELEMENTARY PHILOSOPHY. tz7\nlarger and more perfect connection with the mi\u017fci\nbles, and con\u017fequently a more inten\u017fe cele\ufb05ial\nquality, are more perfect; \u017fuch as have a le\u017fs, the\ncontrary.\n. 9. The virtue of the compound, or the qualities,\nwhich, indeed, with re\u017fpect to the great number,\nvariety, and e\ufb00ects, de\u017ferve our admiration, we do\nnot call elementary; nor proceeding from the ele\nments, but cele\ufb05ial qualities, which are altogether\nderived from the heavenly light; wherefore, the\nelemeutary cele\ufb05ial qualities are of di\ufb00erent kinds :\nand though the \ufb05ars may produce elementary\nqualities in their alternate tran\u017fmutation, they \ufb05ill\nproduce others more excellent, whereby they attain\nthe production of the whole \u017fpecies of the com\npounds.\nIO. The vital heat and radical moi\ufb05ure in ani\nmals, we agree with Ari\ufb05otle in terming qua\nlities entirely cele\ufb05ial, produced from the nature\nof O and D , with the concurrence (which cannot\nbe denied) of all the other \ufb05ars, from which a di\u017f\ntinction is made of \u017fo many di\ufb00erent compounds,\nthough of a nature oppo\u017fite to i each other, that\nthe Iuminarier, with the mali\ufb02cs, generate the poi\n\u017fonous, or the ho\ufb05ile, in\ufb05ead of tho\u017fe that engen\nder with the benign, and on the contrary; whence\nthe antipathies and \u017fympathies of things are mutu\nally derived.\n'11. The qualities, both of the compounds and\nelements, are at \ufb01r\ufb05 powerful, at lea\ufb05, according\n' to\n\fus ASTRONOMY ano\nto nature; then active: but tho\u017fe that are active\nhave their exi\ufb01enCC by the motion of the \u017fucce\u017f\u017five\nbeing; \u017for they \u017fucce\ufb03vely come forth to action\nfrom their powerful \ufb05ations: for which rea\u017fon they\nare again re\ufb05ored to their co-natural \ufb05ate of actual\nqualities.\n12. From the vital heat and radical moi\ufb05ure of\nthe animal power, ari\u017fe \u017fen\u017fitives, appetitives, dejec\ntives, relentives, and each as its exerci\u017fe and ac\ntion; wherefore tho\u017fe powers have \ufb01r\ufb05 a powerful,\nthen an active exi\u017fience.\n13. Tho\u017fe qualities are extingui\u017fhed in a two\nfold manner, naturally and violently. Fir\ufb05, by a\n\ufb01nal a\u017f\u017fumption of a pre-exi\ufb05ing power in an ex\ntreme old age; \u017fecondly, by a violent extinction,\nexhihited by a di\ufb00erent concurrent cau\u017fe.\n14. The powers employ their in\ufb02uence on mat\nter, \u017fuitable to every one of them ; the \u017fen\u017fitive on\nobjects, the vegetativeon elements ; which,the more\nperfect they are by the concoction o\u017f mixture, the \"\ngreater and quicker is their nouri\u017fhment; for it is\nconverted with greater care and perfection, into the.\n\u017fub\ufb05ance of the animal, &c.\n15. There are four principal colours, viz. white,\nblack, light, and darkne\u017fs; by light, we do not mean\nthat which is di\u017f\u017fu\u017ferl from the O and from \ufb01re,\nbut that colour which ari\u017fes from the inten\u017fion of\nthat light, which is almo\ufb05 like gold; by darkne\u017fs,\nits prevention. But there are Colours, \u017fome cele\ufb05ial,\nwhich are compo\u017fed of heavenly qualities, others\nelementary\n\fELEMENTARY PHILOSOPHY- 129\n'elem'entary of the\u017fe elements; but equal PO\ufb03blll\nties \ufb02ow from their alternate permixion; white is a\ncolour merely pa\ufb03ve, light an active.\n. 16. The \ufb05ars, though they never cea\u017fe from ac\ntion, and cau\u017fing an alteration in things below, yet\nfrom that change they produce no remarkable ef<\nfect, eXcept in familiarities. We call the familiarity\nof the luminaries meeting with power, proportio\nnal by an in\ufb02ux motion. Under the name of lu\nminaries, we under\ufb05and not only all the \u017ftars, but\nlikewi\u017fe uncommon phenomena; and We exclude\nevery other place in the heavens which is void of\nlight, for it is b-y light only the \ufb05ars in\ufb02uence, as\nhath been \u017faid before. By the power of the con\njuncts, We exclude from the familiarities tho\u017fe \ufb05ars\nwhich cannot, by any means, he conjoined together;\n'but it is plain that the familiars have not their\nbeingin the heavens, but in the inferior pa\u017f\u017f-able\n\u017fubject. 3\n17. Authors treat of the various and di\ufb00erent\ndi\ufb05inctions of the cele\ufb05ial hou\u017fes, whereof we\nonly approve of 2that which Ptolemy places byvthe\ntwo temporal hou\u017fes : we reject all'the re\ufb05 as vain,\nand quite incon\u017fi\ufb05ent with nature.\n1-8. The \u017figns and hou\u017fes have a real di\ufb05inction,\nnot in the heavens, but in the inferior pa\u017f\u017fable \u017fub\nject, according to its manner of receiving the in\n\ufb02ux of the \ufb05ars; the \u017figns likewi\u017fe have a true and\ncertain \u017fex, but uniform and ma\u017fculine, by an in\n\ufb02ux, proportioned' to the places where the active\nR quality\n\f'30 ASTRONOMYiAND\nquality commences; feminine where the pa\ufb03ve,\nwhich we \u017fhall mention hereafter. I\n19. From the inten\u017fion of the light, proceeds\nan active quality; from its exten\ufb01on, a pa\u017fiive;\nin \u017fhort, every natural principle of an active\nvirtue, has its birth from the intention of light;\nbut the principle of a pa\ufb03ve virtue, from exten\ufb01on.\nFor this rea\u017fon, the \u017fub\ufb05antial material, Form, and\nand all the qualities active in kind, are referred to\nSol; but to the Moon, that principle, NIatter, and\nall its qualities, pa\ufb03ve in kind.\nHence it is manife\ufb05, that the Sun has an active\nvirtue, by rea\u017fon of the inten\u017fion of his light;\nbut the Moon, a pa\ufb03ve, by rea\u017fon of exten\u017fion,\nthough, in reality, there is inten\ufb01on and exten\u017fion\nin both; but in the Sun, iriten\u017fion is prevalent, and\nin the Moon inten\u017fion is incon\ufb01derable, and ex\nten\u017fion prevails; and as by the intrea\u017fe and de\ncrea\u017fe, it \u017fhews us the various quantity of its\n- light in things, it augments and dimini\u017fhes matter\nand moi\ufb05ure,\n20. The variety of colours in the \ufb05ars produce\na diver\u017fity of e\ufb00ects. Thus the colour of the lumi-r\nnaries-Oor of gold, is po\u017f\u017fe\u017f\u017fed of an activevirtue,\nthe \u017fame as the inten\u017fion of light, for it proceeds\nfrom the inten\u017fion of light ; and, as it were,\nfrom the approximate cau\u017fe. White po\u017f\u017fe\u017f\u017fes a\npa\u017f\u017flve virtue, as does exten\u017fion; but the\u017fe two\nprimary colours relate to e\ufb00ects of a'\ufb01mple nature\nwhich are excellent; \u017fuch as material \u017fnb\ufb05ances,\n&c. The other colours in the \ufb05ars, are the cau\u017fe\nof\n\fELEMENTARY PHlLOSOPHY 13!\nof \u017fpeci\ufb01c qualities; \u017fo the blue and yellow, \u017fuch\nas are in 1.', and 2', which are a mixture of white\nand gold, give \u017figns of a temperate nature between\nheat and cold, or moi\ufb05ure; in the blue, heat is\npredominant; in theyellow, moi\ufb05ure; and therefore\nthe\u017fe two planets con\u017fer that which is good, u\u017fex\nful, and plea\u017fant : the former is ma\u017fculine, by rea\n\u017fon of the too great heat; the latter, feminine,\nowing to exce\u017fs of moi\ufb05ure. Leaden and \ufb01ery\ncolours, \u017fuch as are in I; and 3 , \u017fhew an intempe- i\nrature, cold and dry in I; , hot and dry in a; 'Fy\nis rather cold than dry, and therefore ma\u017fculine ;\na more dry then hot, and therefore e\ufb00eminate.\n21. But in general, e\ufb00ects, according to their\nnature, proPerty, pa\ufb03ons, motions, &c. imitate\ntheir cau\u017fe; for the manner of acting follows that\nof being. As the work of Saturn is unplea\u017fant,\nrigid, cold, dark, and black, his motion \ufb02ow,\n&e. nay, more, from the pa\ufb03ons of the luminary\nwhich proceed from local motion, follow pa\ufb03on\nin the e\ufb00ects; as from acce\u017fs and rece\u017fs, follows .\nthe acce\u017fs and rece\u017fs of the pa\ufb03on; and e\ufb00ects\nfrom its near and di\ufb05ant \u017fituation; the near and\nremote action is derived from its inception; the\nbeginning of the action from continuity; from its\nincrea\u017fe, the increa\u017fe. _\n22. From the acce\u017fs, and near \u017fituationofthe \ufb05ars,\nfollOWS the increa\u017fe of the luminaries, with regard\nto exten\u017fion; and from the increa\u017fe re\u017fpecting ex\ntcn\u017fion, follows a \ufb05ill greater inten\u017fion of the lumi\nR 2 nary,\n\f13. ASTRONOMY AND\nnary, according to the degree, at lea\ufb05 in the ef\nfect. From the increa\u017fe of the luminary, with\nregard to exten\u017fion, follows an increa\u017fe of mOi\u017fq\nture: from a greater increa\u017fe of the luminary, fol\nlows a greater heat; and \u017fo ln every one of them.\nAri\ufb05otle's Second General Treati\u017fe, page 56, in\nhis re\u017fearches into the cau\u017fe of the perpetuity of\nthe ri\u017fe and fall of things, informs us, that not\nonly one inference may a\ufb03gn the cau\u017fe of this ri\u017fe\nand fall, but al\u017fo that which contains di\ufb00erent\nmotions, to which the cau\u017fe accede and recede,\nare near or di\ufb05ant in their con\ufb05itution; and their\nacce\u017fs, and near \u017fituation, is the cau\u017fe of genera\ntion; then'rece\u017fh and di\ufb05ant \u017fitua\ufb02on, of cor\nruption.\n23. There is a formation of four c'onjugations\nof the manner of \ufb05arry in\ufb02uence, viz. in the lu\nlminary's increa\u017fe and near \u017fituation; in its near\n\u017fituation, decrea\u017fe, and di\ufb05ance; and in its di\ufb05ance\nand increa\u017fe. By the\u017fe conjugations are con\n\ufb05ituted four quarters; Fir\ufb05, in the world, which\nare the circuits of the \ufb05ars by day from Ea\ufb05 to\nSouth, from South to W'e\ufb05, from VVe\ufb05 to the\nlowe\ufb05, and from the lowe\ufb05 to the Ea\ufb05. Secondly,\nin the Zodiac, and the annual \u017fea\u017fons, from w' to\n25, from to -'_\\_-, from a. to Ice, from lo? to or.\n24. There are four retro\u017fpects of the pla\niwtstotheSun; \ufb01onitheapogeeoftheepkycb,\ntowardsthe \ufb01r\ufb05 \ufb05adon Unthe D towardsthe \u017fh\n'cond decatorn); from the \ufb01r\ufb05 \ufb05ation to the pere\ngee;\nI\n\fELEMENTARY PHlLOSOPHY- '33\ngee; from thence to the \u017fecond \ufb05ation (in the D\ntowards the \u017fecond decatom), at lea\ufb05, as far as the\napogee. From the\u017fe are derived an excellent rea\u017fon,\nwhy the three \u017fuperiors are \u017fuppo\u017fed to be \ufb05ronger;\nif they are to be matutine or ezzflern, from the O;\nthe three inferiors ve\u017fpertine, or we\ufb05ern; for then\nthey have a greater degree of light, in which con\n\u017fi\ufb05s their virtual influence, and then they are cal\nled ea\ufb05ern; but we\ufb05ern, ifotherwi\u017fe. Every one\nknOWS how largely, yet, to no purpo\u017fe, authors\nhave treated of the orientality of the planets.\n25. From the cardinal points of the world, and\nthe Zodiac, the \ufb05ars begin to in\ufb02uence the four\nprimary qualities; from the mo\ufb05 inferior and tro-'\npic of as, moi\ufb05ure; from the Ea\ufb05 and m, heat;\nfrom the culminate and tropic of Ice, dryne\u017fs; from\nthe We\ufb05 and A, coldne\u017fs ; but by all the\u017fe means,\nthe \ufb05ars, though they have their nature ah\u017folute\nin them\u017felves, they neverthele\u017fs produce all the\nfour primary qualities, though with a di\ufb00erence,\non account of the diver\u017fity of the nature o\u017f the\n\ufb05ars; but they continually increa\u017fe the qualities\nthey produce, by advancing \u017fuccrz\ufb03vely to the op\npo\u017fite points ; \u017fuch is the rea\u017fon they likewi\u017fe le\u017f\n\u017fen the contrary quality. i \\\n26. From the\u017fe, it is inferred, that thelin\ufb05ux\nand rays of the \ufb05ars, depend on real motion and\nillumination, not on the quantity of the heavenly\n\u017fpace, nor the \u017fituation, and therefore the \ufb05ars in\nthe\n\f33, ASTRONOMY AND\nthe falling hou\u017fes are weak; in the \u017fucceeding,\n\ufb05rong; in the cardinals, \ufb05ronge\ufb05, &c.\n27. All the active qualities, whether of the e]e-_\nments, or of the compounds, depend on the ho\nrary extent of the \ufb05ars round the world ; but bez\ncau\u017fe the duration of things are various, annual,\nmonthly, and diurnal, with which Ptolemy agrees\nin his Chapter of Things that have no Nouri\u017fhment,\nand the Second Stagyrite and GeneralTreati\u017fe, page\n5, they are diurnal, as being the \ufb01r\ufb05 and immediate\nin the order of the work ; for in the order of per-_\nfection they are the lowe\ufb05, and the annual dura\ntions are in the \ufb01r\ufb05 place, by rea\u017fon of their per\nfection. '\n.\u017fi 28. The virtual qualities \u017f\u017fof the elements depend\non the latitudes of the \ufb05ars in the Zodiac. The\nvital qualities of \u017fuch as live through months and\nyears, depend on the Sun's place in the Zodiac, and\n' the Moon, in re\u017fpect of the Sun, as from pre\u017fent\ncau\u017fes, but are pie-ordained by the Sun's bearing\nround the world, and by the Moon round the Sun:\nwhence the motions of the directions and progre\u017f\n\u017fions are derived. \u017f\u017f '\n29. The di\u017f\u017ferencns of the cele\ufb05ial qualities that\nhe in the compounds, are both vital; and tho\u017fe that\nare not dependant on the various congre\u017fiions and\n\u017familiarities of the luminaries, with the other \ufb05ar,\nboth erratic and fixed; on the di\ufb00erent places in\nthe Zodiac, \u017fo far as they are ofa di\ufb00erent nature;\nfor from the \u017fimple places, both in the Zodiac, as\n- _ well\n\fELEMENTARY PHILOSO\u00deHY. 1'35\n'well as round the world; that is, (if they are thus\ncon\u017fidered) the primary qualities of the elements\nare derived.

At the con\ufb01itution of the cele\ufb05ial mo\nment, there is no need of its longer per\u017feverance,\nto make the e\ufb00ects the cau\u017fe of pre\u017fervation; for\nthis is impo\u017f\u017fible; but it is \u017fu\ufb03cient that it'concur\nwith the neare\u017ft cau\u017fes', to confer being, and the.\nco-natural qualities: for \u017fo it is, that he who is\n\u017f\u017fborn, throughout his whole life has a reference to,\nand, as it were, repre\u017fents the e\ufb00ects; and as a\n'\ufb05amp re\u017fembles the \u017feal, \u017fo does the con\ufb05itution\nof the \ufb05ars his nativity.\n31.

That the\u017fe familiarities happen and are.\npowerful only among the \ufb05ars, which are there\nin motion, but are pOWerful to the cardinals and\nre\ufb05of the hou\u017fes, we ab\u017folutely deny; for omitting\nother rea\u017fons, the \ufb05ars move not to the c'ardinals,\n. _ _ _ by.\na\n\fELIMENTARY antosopnv. 44:\nby advancing above the Zodiac; which is the\nJealbn they do not e\ufb00ect any proportional di\ufb05ance:\n.to tho\u017fe cardinals, but the rays are no more than\n.pro.p0rtional di\ufb05ances, &e.\n4 40.. The. familiarities of the \ufb05ars in the world\nis a proportionale in\ufb02ux of the \ufb05ars, agreeable to\nmotion round the world; and they happen, and are\ne\ufb03cacious in the preportional divi\u017fion of the diur\nnal and nocturnal arcs, and no other way.\n44. But becau\u017fe the \ufb05ars have a mutual motion\nunder the primam mabile, and round the world, it\nhappens that they mutually contract both kinds of\n,familiarity; as Ptolomy in the place already cited\nin\u017finuates. But \u017familiarities, taken in any other\nmanner, and in any' other circle, even in the\nequator, (according to the opinion of Maginus) are\nentirely reprobated, and to be rejected.\n42. The\u017fe two kinds o\u017f \u017familarities being given,\nwe \u017fay, that. in every kind, neither more or le\u017fs\nthen nine \u017fpecies are found, Which are 6 , * ,Q, g\n.A, Sqq, Bq, 8, and parallels called by \u017fome Anti\n\u017fcions, which Keple'r, by an exqui\u017fite and plain\nrea\u017fon, has \u017felected from their concording harmo\nnies. O\u017fthe\u017fe familiarities, the Sex-tile, Qiintile,\nTrine, and Biquintile, are benign; the andrate,\nSe\u017fquiquadrate, \"and Oppo\u017fition malign; the re\ufb05\nindi\ufb00erent with the fortunate \ufb05ars, and equally\n\u017fo with the.un\u017fortunate.\n. 43. The latitudinal \ufb05ars do not commit all\ntheir vi-rtual in\ufb02uence to the ecliptic, but pre\u017ferve\n'. 1 It\n\f'm asraonouv a-N\u00de\nit among them\u017felves; and their greater or le\u017f\u017fe'\nproximity to the ecliptic, adds not, nor le\u017f\u017fons.\ntheir power of acting : the ecliptic cannot act withv\nout the \ufb05ars, but the \ufb05ars have their activity in\nthem\u017felves wholly independent on the ecliptic.\n44. The \ufb05ars alternately eonjoined, do not ae\nquire greater or le\u017f\u017fer powers to act in a \u017favour\nable conjunction, which falls out when another is\nfound within the \u017fphere of the other's activity,\nfrom a greater or le\u017fs alternate proximity; but we\nonly \u017fay, that their active virtues are the more or\nle\u017fs conjoined. Under the name of the Sphere of\nActivity, we under\ufb05and tho\u017fe that Ptolemy has\nplaced, in Jupiter twelve degtees, in Venus eight\ndegrees, &to.\n45. But the \ufb05ars which are found in the fame\npartial longitude, we do not call conjoined in a fay\nvourable conjunction, i\u017f their alternate di\ufb01ance be\ngreater by latitude, than is their \u017fphere of activity;\nas' 2 with 8o of \u017fouth latitude, is not \u017favours\nably conjoined with 4, having a northern la-z\ntitude, though they are \u017found in the \u017fame degree\nand minute of longitude ; they may indeed be \u017faid\nto be conjoined by virtual conjunction, if they\nn\u017fcend or de\u017fcend in the \u017fame horary circle; or car\ndinal, which is one of the \u017fpecies of mundane\na\u017fpects. - _\n46. The \ufb05ars therefore \u017fhould not be cardinally\nplaced; nor even tho\u017fe that are \ufb01xed with the\nother planets, if the latitude di\ufb05ance from the cir,\ncles\n\fELEMENTARY PHILOSOPHY. m\ncles of po\u017fition be greater than their \u017fphere of arc-\nt-ivity; nor ought any di\ufb00erence to be made bc\ntween the a\u017fpects of the natural con\ufb05itution, and\ntho\u017fe produced by the motion of direction in pre\n\u017fcrving the latitude, as Argol thinks, there being\nequal rea\u017fon in both ca\u017fes.\n47. In de\ufb01ning the intermediate rays, the half\nlatitude in ale and A is not to be ob\u017ferved, nor re\njected in quartile, as Blanolinus has taught, whom\n\u017fome author-s imitate: but the latitude of both a\u017f\npect: are to be ob\u017ferved; for the rays. are to be\nprojected from the body of one to that of another,\nas it happens that the\u017fe \ufb05ars are found by latitude;\n\u017fo that in whatever latitude the planets are, they\nemit and receive the rays in proportional di\ufb05ances,\ntaken with regard to longitude; as the * in the\ndi\ufb05ance of 609, the a in 90, ac. We would\nhave this always ob\u017ferved, both in the daily mo\ntions of the planets, as in the directions and proe\ngre\ufb03ons, wherein the \ufb01gni\ufb01ca-tors advance by their\n'own real and natural Way, on which they receive\nand emit the a\u017fpect-[stand in all the motions of the\n\ufb05ars.\n48. The \ufb01xed \ufb05ars that are in a favourable\nconjunction with the planets, e\ufb00ect with them:\nthe other a\u017fpects in the primam ma\u00feilc, which\notherwi\u017fe have no e\ufb00ect.

That which is vulgar-ly termed anti\u017fcions,\nwe call parallels in the primam mobile; becau\u017fe we'\nwould have them to be nothing el\u017fe but parallel:\nto the equator, as Ptolomy hints, as they\nii\u017fe at an equal \u017fpace of time, and de\u017fcribe the\nfame parallels, for which rea\u017fon, called the an\nti\u017fcion, or parallel. The primam mabz\u017file is\u017fi equi\ndi\ufb05ant from the equator; and ifit be of the \u017fame\ncountry, it is called the primary parallel, or Op-'\npo\u017fite; if of a di\ufb00erent country, the Northcom;\nmands, the South obeys; and they are taken fromI\nthe table of declination, but parallel-in its phy\u017fical\n\u017fen\u017fe, in an equal power of the in\ufb02uence of'the\n\ufb01ars from the primam mobile. _\n'- 51. The twelve hou\u017fes or man\u017fions in heayen,\nauthors divide \u017feveral ways, but they all di\u017fagree.\n\u017fiRejecting the opinion of them all, we, with\nPtolomy, di\ufb05ingui\u017fh them by the temporal hou\u017fes;\n\u017fi for\n\fBLEMENTARY PHXLOSOPHY. [45\nfor_\u017fo it is, that there is proportional and equal\ndivi\u017fion, not, indeed of the heavenly and aerial\n_\u017fpace, but of the \u017fuCCe\ufb03ve in\ufb02ux of the \ufb05ars and\nhou\u017fes; and Munitun \u017fays, appear equal and pro\n'portionah But it is our opinion, that the divi\u017fion\nof the hou\u017fes, 'by great circles pa\ufb03ng through the\ncommon \u017fection's of the horizon and meridian,\nand the twelve equal divi\u017fions of the equator,\nwhich late authors make u\u017fe of, is of all, the mo\ufb05\nnimate from, and abh'orrent to natural truth.\n32.

As in the primum\nmabilc, they riepre\u017fent the \u017fame quantity of the\na\u017fcen\u017fion of the \u017fi\u017figns: for example, the \u017figns X\nadder, al'\u017fonan'd zaa\u017fcend at the \u017fame time; with\n\u017fo much likene\u017fs do they exhibit the \u017fame quality\nof a\u017fcen\u017fion and de\u017fcen\u017fion in the world, that the\neleventh hou\u017fe cau\u017fes an a\u017fcen\u017fion equal to the\nde\u017fcen\u017fion of the ninth, and the twelfth hou\u017fe equal\nto the \u017fecond, &e.

As in the primam\nmobilc, they exhibit equal temporal hours, \u017fo in\nthe world they exhibit the equal temporal hours\nof the di\ufb05ances from the cardinals. The\nParallels in the priinum moln'le, are at an equal\ndi\ufb05ance from the pole of the world; the parallela\nin the World have the \u017fame pole as elevation;\nand other re\u017femblances, if required, will be\nfound.\n54. The e\ufb03cacy of all the parallels, both in the\nprimum mobile, and in the world, con\u017fi\ufb05s in the\nparity of the degree of quality, which the \ufb05ars\n\u017found in the e\ufb00ect of the parallels; as it is plainly\ngathered from tho\u017fe which we mentioned in \u017fect;\n25; for by going through inten\u017fion, and returning\nthrough remi\u017f\u017fion, from the cardinal points, it\nhappens, that they e\ufb00ect an equal degree o\u017fquality,\nas well under the primam mobi\/c, as round the\nworld.\n55. As for the ri\u017ft\/es qf po\u017fition in which the\n\ufb01gni\ufb01cators are \u017faid to remain immOveable, and\nupon which they are to be directed, and their\noblique a\u017fcen\u017fion to be taken, tho\u017fe great circles\npa\u017f\u017fing through the common \u017fections of the horizon\nand meridian, according to late authors, cannot be\nreceived; for this opinion is Openly incon\u017fx\ufb05ent\nwith the precepts of Ptolemy; but tho\u017fe \u017feats or\nparts,\n\fELEMENTARY PHtLOSQPHY. m\nparts of the circle are to be received, in which the\n\ufb01ars having a di\ufb00erent declination, e\ufb00ect equal\ntemporal hours. From what has been \u017faid, this\nconclu\u017fion is drawn, and agrees with the divi\u017fions\nof the hou\u017fes, through the two temporal hours,\nand with the mundane rays.

The motion of direction is that which the\nSun cau\u017fes every day, following that of the nati\n. vity, in whatever latitude, in power 'and virtue;\nthe vital heat with itsinatural, e\ufb00ects, viz. from\nevery day to every year' by Order: for it happens,\nthat at the end o\u017f the \ufb01r\ufb05, after the natural day,\nwhen the Sun has returned to the \u017fame equal hour\nof the nativity, the parts of the priinum mobile,\nwith all the \ufb05ars, have nearly gone through one\ndegree of the equator; and the \u017fame happens every\n\u017fub\u017fequent day : mean while the \ufb05ars,'as they ad\nvance, apply either by body or rays, to theihou\u017fes\nof the \u017figni\ufb01cators.\n59. There is a doub'e motion of direction. The\ndirect, which Ptolomy calls Actinabalium, and tells\nus is formed toward the following \u017figns, and the\ncant\/ev\u017fg, which he terms Horinimny, and\u017f\u017f\u017fhe\ufb02ws us it\nis firmed towards the preceding places.\n60. By the third l'hotion of direction, we direct\nthe angles and all the moderators; but by a con\nver\u017fe motion, the angles cannot be directed.\n61. The arr__les only receive the rays in the\nworld, but nor the parellels, nor the rays in the\nZodiac.

By a conver\u017fe direction, the \u017figni\ufb01cator, if\nhe de\u017fcends from the top, \ufb05rikes again\ufb05 the we\ufb05;\nand. all the rays that be between the \ufb01gni\ufb01cators,\nwe\ufb05; yet the rays are to be taken in the world;\nfor in a conver\u017fe direction, the rays have no place\nin the Zodiac, as has been \u017faid, but the ho\ufb05ile rays\nof the malignant that lie between, either cut o\ufb00,\nor take away the years from the number of direc-v\ntion to the we\ufb05; as on the contrary, the rays ofthe\nbenign, either pre\u017ferve or add the year, according\nto PtolomyTS method, which we \u017fhall treat upon\nin the Canons.\n63. It al\u017fo happens, when the \ufb01gni\ufb01cator and\npromittor are hurried away together, by the mo\ntion of the primam mobile, in order to pro'duce\nparallels in the world-equally powerful with all\nthe other a\u017fpects. r\n64. In a direct direction, the \ufb01gni\ufb01cators ad\nvance by their own real way; as the Sun by the\necliptic, the Moon by her circle, upon which\n\u017fucce\ufb03vely \u017fhe alters her latitude, in proportion\nto her latitude motion. The \u017fame is to be \u017faid of\nall, when they become \u017figni\ufb01cators. _\n65.

But we, tothe \ufb01r\ufb05 year after\nthe.\n\f15' ASTRONOMY AND\nthe natural, add that part of the equator in which\nthe Sun a\u017fcends in a direct \u017fphere, by the motion\nof the \ufb01r\ufb05 day following the nativity;to the \u017fecond\nyear, that which a\u017fcends by the \u017fecond day's mo\ntion; to the third, that which he a\u017fcends the third\nday after the natural; and thus of the other \u017fub-z\n\u017fequent ones: for we would have the directional\nmotion \u017fucce\ufb03ve, and always formed towards the\n\u017fucceeding places, and the Sun's motion each day\nto be referred to, as the cour\u017fe and rule to every\nyear, as to their e\ufb00ects, in the \u017fame order and\nnumber. i\n66. But becau\u017fe the p'rimary and principal mo\ntion of direction is derived from the motion of the\n\u017folar days, following that of the nativity, as has\nbeen \u017faid, it con\u017fequently happens, that by \u017fome\n\u017fecondary means, the a\u017fpects that are oppo\u017fite to\nthe l-uminaries and angles on tho\u017fe days, by jointly\na\ufb03\ufb05ing the \ufb01gni\ufb01cator of the primary directions;\nfor this rea\u017fon, we \u017fay, that the days whereon\nthe\u017fe a\u017fpects happen, are very powerful in tho\u017fe\nyears, which 'an\u017fwer to tho\u017fe days, and on which\nthey depend; From tho\u017fe motions, in preference\nto the re\ufb05, appears the true and real, hitherto,\nunknown foundation of the critical or climactrical\nyears; for the Moon, almo\ufb05 every \u017feventh day, is\nN placed in the critical plate with re\u017fpect to her place\nof the nativity; and (which is very important)\nexperience wonderfully proves the truth of it;\nas\n\fELEMENTARY PHXLOSOPHY. rst\nas may be \u017feen in the examples extracted from Ar\ngol and Maginus. We 'call the\u017fe motions the\n\u017fecondary directions, to di\ufb05ingui\u017fh them from the\nprimary and principal ; and we are of opinion,\nthat Ptolemy, \u017fpeaking of annual places, as the\nplaces of tho\u017fe motions, when of the men\ufb05rual,\nhints at the places of the progre\ufb03on.\n67. The equal and uniform progre\u017f\u017fions which\nare commonly made u\u017fe of, are thought to be fal\u017fe;\nfor there appears no rea\u017fon or foundation to \u017fup\nport them; nay, all the pro\u017fe\u017f\u017fors with one voice\na\ufb03rm, they do not corre\u017fpond with the e\ufb00ects.\nWherefore, becau\u017fe we think the motions take their\nri\u017fe from the Moon's circuit towards the Sun, by\nwhich it pre-ordains in power and virtue, the ra\ndical moi\ufb05ure with its co-e\ufb00ects; \u017fo in like man\nner the motion of the direction originates from the\nSun, by which it pre-ordains the vital heat;\ntherefore the progre\u017f\u017fional motions are cau\u017fed by\nthe Moon in her circuits towards the Sun; aan\nreturns to the \u017fame appearance, illuminations, or_\ndi\ufb05ance with the Sun; con\u017fequently every one ofi - 7\n' the circuits, after the iiat\u017fihzity, has a reference andL\n(re\u017fpect to, as the cau\u017fe of all the years o\u017flife, OF\nwhoever is born, and the Moon's progre\u017fs, through\nall the \u017figns, almo\ufb05 every month.\n'68.

It is of \u017fome importance to know\nthe time of conception, as well as to know the true\ntime ofbirth; for by the \ufb01r\ufb05, the accident: and\ntemperature before birth are known; and by the\n\u017fecond, tho\u017fe incident to our whole lives are to be\ndi\u017fcovered.

The planets or 83 or 23 in the a\u017fcendant,\no-r any planet beholding the a\u017fcendant with a\u017fpect.\nFourth.

The \u017fea\u017fon of the year and that \u017fign the\nSun is in.\nSixth, The almuten, or that planet which has\ngreate\ufb05 dignities in the \ufb01gure. I\nThe\u017fe rules being properly attended to, and ga\nthered according to order, and \u017fub\ufb01raction made, the\nle\u017f\u017fer from the-greater, we may ea\u017fily find the pre-'\ndominant humour, and con\u017fequently judge of the\n'\ufb01ze, temperature, and complexion of the native.\nBut it is neCe\u017f\u017fary to premi\u017fe, that if cold and\nmoi\u017fture prevail in a geniture, the native will be\nphlegmatic: if cold and dryne\u017fs have'the \u017fupeo\nriority, he will-acquire a re\u017ferred habit and be op\npre\u017f\u017fed\n\fny, ASTRONOM-Y and\npre\u017f\u017fed with melancholy: if heat and, moi\ufb05ure pre\ndominate, he will prove ofa \u017fanguine temperature,\nand of an even courteous di\u017fpo\u017fition: if. heat and\ndryne\u017fs, he will be cholerick, and of a, \u017furly tem\nper ; but where the qualities of the con\ufb01gurating\n\ufb01ars are nearly equal, the native will be \ufb05rongly\na\ufb00ected by their temperatures re\u017fpectively, when\nunder a direction of their own nature and quality.\nOn Climactrim] Tears\nClimactrical years are nothing more than the times\nor periods in which the lVIoon makes her quarters\nto the point \u017fhe is in at birth, mea\u017fured by her own\nmotion, and applied to the years of the native'sg\nlife, and to allow for each day's motion of the\nNloon one year, and for every two hours one\nmonth, by which may be judged the native's \ufb01r\ufb05\nclimactrical year, \u017fecond, third, and fourth; and\nhere ob\u017ferve the time the Moon took in making\nher \ufb01r\ufb05 quarter after birth, declares when the\n\ufb01r\ufb05 climactrical year is; the \u017fecond quarter, the\n\u017fecond climactrical year, and \u017fo on, till we begin\nthe \ufb01r\ufb05 again. 7 in65\nOn Rcwlutz'am'.\nRevolutions are no other than to ob\u017ferve the\n\u017fituation o\u017fthe planets, at the time the Sun' returns\nto his radical place; and if at that time any of the\nplanets tran\u017fit their own, or behold their own\nPlace with any a\u017fpect, then they have powerful ef\nfects; 'if none of the\u017fe happen, then there can be no\njudgment drawn from a revolution that year.\nTHE END.\n\fEZ' The Reader z's de\u017firtd to ob\ufb05r've, that tbc\ufb02regaz\u017fing\nTable: gf Hou\u017fes, are tbo\ufb05 alludcd to in Ca\nnon VI. a: [ning more properly adapted to this\nI\u017folume.\nw\n\fI, nag PRESS, a'zrl\u017f\u00fendiz'y will be pu\u017fhed, i\n(Price Ten Shillings and Sixpence)\nA\nC 0 L L E C T I O N\nThirty Remarkable Nativities.\n1'0\nILLUSTRATB the CANONS,\nAND\nPROVE\u017fithe TRUE PRINC'lPLI-ZS\no!\"\nELEMENTARY PHILOSOPHY.\ni Tran\ufb01ated from the LATIN of\nPpLAClDUS DE TlTUS.\nTo rwbz\u017ficb i: pre\ufb01xed,\nTo facilitate A\ufb05ronomical Calculations,\nTable' of Right A\u017feen\u017fion, Declinationyand A\u017fcen\u017fional Di\ufb00erence;\nTables of Double\ufb02Horary Times, Semi-diurnal and Nocturnal Ares ;\nSexagenary Tables, and-Logi\ufb05ical Logarithm: 5 Tables for equatng\nthe Seven Erratics 3 Table of \ufb01xed Scars, &e. &e.\n'The whole arrangcd in a conci\u017fe and regular Method, and exempli\u017fied\nwith \u017fuitable Matter to elucidate Elementary Agency, and to form\nan Adept in the Sideral and Sublime My\ufb05eries.\nBeauti\ufb01ed and Embelli\u017fhed with '\nTHIRTY ELEGANT EN GRAVINGS,\nFrom the above NA'erITIts\nTHE W'HOLB CARLFVLLiY REVXSED\nBYM.SIBLY.\nL O N D O N :\nPrinted by W.
