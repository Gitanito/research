Long, MJD.\nI have chosen for the subject of my paper the psycho-\nanalytic use of subliminal material, believing this to be\nsomething of interest to all of us. The S.P.R. has made\nintimate studies of various subconscious phenomena, which\nI have not as yet foiuid time to follow. I, on the other\nhand, have been acquiring a practical knowledge of the\nworking of the unconscious part of the mind in particular\nways which are probably unfamiliar to many of my\n. readers. There should be here a j)romising field for dis-\ncussion and I welcome the opportunity now given me of\nopening it.\nI am using the word \" unconscious \" in the sense intro-\nduced by Freud. In a paper published by this Society he\nsaid, \"Let us call 'conscious' the conception which is\nJ\nThis paper was read at a General Meeting of the Society on January 31, 1917.\nVOL. XXX. A\n\f2 Constance E. Long, M.D. [pabt\npresent to our consciousness and of which we are aware,\nand let this be the only meaning of the word '\nconscious '\n;\nas for latent conceptions, if we have any reason to believe\nthey exist in the mind\u2014as we have in the case of memory\n-\n\u2014let them be denoted by the term '\nunconscious '.\"\nFreud's \"unconscious\" corresponds to the \"subliminal\"\nof Myers, viz. \" those thoughts and feelings lying beneath\nthe ordinary threshold of consciousness, as opposed to the\n'\nsupraliminal,' lying above the threshold.\" Freud dis-\ntinguishes between the preconscious and the completely\nunconscious layers of the unconscious mind. The contents\nof the preconscious have once been conscious and they\ncan fairly easily become conscious again, if suitable\nstimuli occur. The completely unconscious part of the mind\nhas contents which have never yet reached consciousness\nat all. According to Freud, this material remains uncon-\nscious because of a powerful unconscious resistance against\nits admission into consciousness. It is connected with\ninfantile wish-tendencies which are incompatible with the\nadult thinking or feeling. It is kept unconscious by a\nmechanism which he calls \" repression.\" The barrier pro-\nduced by repression can only be surmounted with great\ndifficulty. It may be psychologically \" rushed,\" so to\nspeak, as in an attack of mania, where the unconscious\nmaterial breaks through into consciousness and holds the\nfield in a disastrous manner ; or it may be systematically\nbrought up, as in psychoanalysis, by the help of the\nconsciousness, with an end in view, chiefly that one may\ngain control over something which, if neglected, tends to\nget the upper hand.\nWhile touching upon the different views of the uncon-\nscious mind, I had better just mention Jung's conception\nof the personal and impersonal unconscious.1\nHe recog-\nnises in the unconscious mind material which in its origin\nis independent of any land of personal experience, but\nwhich is inherited and latent, derived from our remotest\nancestors and common to the human mind and soul, just\nas certain histological elements are common to the human\nbody. This he calls the impersonal or collective uncon-\nCollected Papers on Analytical Psychology, 2nd ed.\n\flxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material 3\nscions. It is this impersonal content which makes men so\nmuch more alike in the unconscious than in the conscious.\nIt is akin to the undifferentiated, mind of the primitive or\nof the little child, neither of whom separates subject and\nobject in thought. From one point of view, the process\nof developing individuality consists in finding the poise\nbetween what belongs to the personal and what to the\nimpersonal or collective thinking and feeling. One has to\ndevelop one's own individual capacities and qualities by\na process of differentiation from those which are a race\ninheritance.\nThe adaptation of the individual to society is a task\nfor the whole of life, and one which presents special\ndifficulties to people who deviate from the normal, as do\nneurotics. To lead a satisfactory life one must develop\nas an individual and also as a member of a group, and\ngrowth in either direction should be complementary, not\nantagonistic, to growth in the other direction. In analysis\nof the unconscious mmd we soon find how great is the\nunconscious conflict between these two sets of claims.\nThese two lines of cleavage, viz. that between the personal\nand impersonal or collective of Jung, and that between\nthe individual qua individual and qua member of a group,\nhave a parallel in the cleavage between the conscious self\nand the subconscious infantile or primitive tendencies.\nBut the unconscious mind is not to be regarded as merely\ninfantile and primitive, except in the sense that the\ninfantile contains all the possibilities of future develop-\nment. Moral instincts 1\nare as much an essential content\nof the unconscious mind as are the sexual instincts upon\nwhich Freud has unfortunately laid such undue stress.\nPrimitive man, whom we all own in our ancestry, made\ntaboos and imposed barriers upon what he unconsciously\nfelt to be his more dangerous instincts. This fact is of\ngreat significance and justifies belief in the fundamental\ngoodness of man in his main development.\nTo turn from the origin of subconscious phenomena to\ntheir actual characteristics. It is clear that the unconscious\n1\nTrotter calls these \" gregarious instincts.\" See Herd Instinct in Peace\nand War.\n\f4 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nmind expresses itself in curiously veiled symbols. Freud\nattributes this veiling mainly to the activity of a\nhypothetical \" censor,\" who cannot allow a more direct\nexpression of unconscious infantile wishes, because they\nare distasteful and unwelcome to the conscious personality.\nJung gives little credit to the censor and sees in the\nveiled symbolism the primitive human mode of thinking,\nof which the dream is a survival, and which is shown also\nin the construction of myths and in folk-lore. This\ndifference in emphasis between Jung and Freud leads to\nwidely different results. The Freudian interpretation of\nsymbols becomes monotonous and stultifying. The other\ninterpretation reveals a richness in the content of dreams\nwhich is fully in accordance with the creative and evolu-\ntional character of the human mind.\nLet me now turn to psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis is\na technique for discovering and analysing the contents of\nthe unconscious mind. It is a therapy, specially beneficial\nin illnesses caused by disturbances in the unconscious\nregion of the mind, functional diseases, such as hysteria,\nand other psychoneuroses. It may be regarded histori-\ncally as an offspring of hypnotism, as chemistry is an\noffspring of alchemy. In each case the offspring differs\nwidely from the parent. In hypnotism unconscious mental\nprocesses are covered up from the patient ; in analysis\nthey are laid bare. The history of hypnotism is too well\nknown to need comment here, save to say that most\npsychoanalysts of repute have hitherto come to the newer\ntherapy via the old. Psychoanalysis owes a debt to\nhypnotism and to those pioneers who initiated the use of\na psychic remedy for psychic diseases.\nHysteria and hypnotism show us the mind in dissection\nor dissociation. Analysis deliberately seeks to analyse the\nmind, even the morbid and distraught mind, into its\nelements. It makes the subconscious contents conscious\nwith an aim in view. This naturally has a somewhat\ndisturbing effect on the individual, for it involves a kind\nof operation on the mind. But as with surgical operations,\nits aim is not only to disturb and dissect, but to resect\nand heal, leaving the condition healthy, with the function\n\flxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material 5\nrestored. The physical healing and renewal correspond to\nthe synthetic or reconstructive side of analysis.\nIn hypnosis an apparent synthesis is obtained. This\nacts effectively for a time, and may suffice for life. There\nis, however, considerable risk that under a severe accidental\nemotional strain fresh dissociation will occur. The process\nof synthesis in hypnotism is not a conscious one. It is\ninexplicable to the patient, who accepts it gratefully as\nsomething akin to the miraculous. In psychoanalysis the\ncause of the dissociation and the means of the synthesis\nare made apparent to the patient. The resulting cure\nshould theoretically withstand all the events of life. Of\ncourse this is not so in fact. We have to acknowledge our\nshare of failures. It must be remembered that much of\nour work is done on very nervous people, and that these\nvery sufferers are asked to contribute a great amount of\neffort. They must be people of good will, capable of\nco-operation. At first sight this demand on the neurotic,\nthough wholesome, seems very hard. He is extra sensitive\nand painfully self-conscious. He unconsciously protects\nhimself from the mental sufferings to Avhich his peculiar\nmake of mind renders him susceptible, in one of two ways :\neither he shuts himself up within himself and develops\nsymptoms such as phobias, or fears, which tend to deliver\nhim from his environment ;\nor else he develops hysterical\nsymptoms, such as blindness, or paralysis, which tend to\nthrow him on to the sympathy of people around him. In\nthe first case he turns his j)sychic energy inwards by a\nprocess of introversion ; in the second he turns it outwards\nby a process of extraversion. In each case the same\npurpose is served-\u2014a modification of the individual's actual\nrelation to the world and to the demands made upon him\nby \"daily life. Each is the outcome of an unconscious\nchildish attitude of mind. Psychoanalysis aims at helping\nthe patient to find the unknown causes of this attitude,\nand his understanding must accompany the analytical pro-\ncess at every step. \" Neurosis is a failure in adaptation\nto life.\" The origin of the first mental dissociation was\nin the unconscious, and it is there we must ultimately\nfind the means for the desired synthesis. Whatever in\n\fG Constance E. Long, 31. D. [part\nthe morbid symptoms is not understood\u2014not merely\nintellectually but emotionally too\u2014contains a possibility\nof present failure and future breakdown. Jung says. \"In\npsychoanalysis the infantile personality must be set free\nfrom the unconscious hindrances to its development in a\nrational manner. The energy which is thus freed serves\nfor the building up of a personality matured and adajited\nto reality, who does willingly and without compulsion\neverything required of him by reality.\" 1 The Scotch have\na way of describing a man by saying \" there's not much\nto him.\" In analysis we find there is much more to a\nman than he was aware of, and this applies generally to\nthe healthy and to the morbid. It is not merely a ques-\ntion of resources\u2014it is one of energy. It is useless for a\ncountry at war to contain rich coal fields if there is no\none to work them. The nervous invalid is in a similar\nposition. He has large resources which he cannot develop\nand which are an actual encumbrance to him, because\nthey offer a temptation to the enemy, and use up his own\nenergy in an unproductive way in guarding them.\nThis brings me to an important psychoanalytic concept,\ncalled the libido theory. It was first introduced by Freud,\nbut greatly extended by Jung and I shall explain it\nentirely from the standpoint of the Swiss school. The\nterm libido is used by Jung not in the ordinary Latin\nsense of the word, but as equivalent to psychic energy.\nThis libido or psychic energy is the central impulsive or\npropulsive force in human nature and human actions. It\nmay also be described as interest, desire, inclination,\ncapacity for action. It may be applied to one object\nor another, from which follows the shifting of interest\nfrom one thing to another. Like physical energy it may\nbe kinetic or potential, i.e. active or latent. It may also\nbe transmuted from one form to another ; this may happen\nsuddenly, as in a moment of danger when the energy\ndirected to the occupation of the moment is converted\ninto paralysing fear, or into the effort to escape ; or the\ntransmutation may be gradual, as in the process of sub-\nlimation, when the energy passes through a variety of\n1\nPsychology of the Unconscious.\n\flxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material 7\nforms, and is applied successively to different and higher\nfunctions. Thus the combative instinct which makes war\nbetween nations may be directed to the promotion of\ninternational peace. One has only to think of a life's\nprogress to realize that the energy which was once applied\nto activities infantile in character, and appropriate during\ninfancy, has to take other forms at later stages of growth.\nWhat was once automatically given to sucking is later\ndevoted to eating, which is a conscious process. The love\nwhich was originally given solely to the mother, that is\nto an undifferentiated object within a group recognised\nas \" mother,\" is gradually applied to the differentiated\nmother, to the nurse, father, other members of the family,\nand later to companions, teachers, lovers, and causes. It\nis clear that the psychic energy, where development is\nnormal, is differently applied at 6, 16 and 60, and, to\njudge by external behaviour, this is generally the case.\nBut the psychic energy must be looked for on both sides\nof the threshold of consciousness ; not the whole of it is\nin the conscious life. Some is with our subliminal\nmemories and imaginations. There is a tendencv for too\nmuch of it to be applied below the threshold of con-\nsciousness. This is particularly the case with neurotic\npeople, for the reason that those who cannot live agreeably\nto themselves in the real world are led to create a world\nof phantasy to live in. This produces a thinning of the\nforceful currents of life, and in some hysterical subjects\nthe thinning is so extreme as to result in complete dis-\nsociation of the personality\u2014a fact illustrated by the\nclassical cases frequently referred to in the literature of\nour Society. Absent-minded acts show a temporary and\npartial dissociation ; we are not \" on the spot,\" as we\nsay ; that is, the psychic energy has momentarily retired\nfrom consciousness and dipped into the subconscious.\nIn our work as analysts we strive to find where this\nmissing energy is located. We actually find that much of\nit is applied to phantasy building. We all know what it\nis to day-dream ; but what we do not know so well is\nthat day-dreams occur without our being even aware of\nthem\u2014they may be entirely subliminal. A person is\n\f8 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\napjDroximately normal when the psychic energy is well\napplied, and flows easily from point to point, as required\nby life, in his thoughts, feelings and actions. A person\nis neurotic when the stream tends to stagnate, to remain\nin lacunae, or to run in too many directions at once. He\nis then like the owner of treasure who has no means of\nrealizing it. There are people of many talents whose\nenergy is lacking, and people of small talents whose\nenergy is all available, and it is adapted energy, after\nall, that tends to make one individual more effective than\nanother. There are some who have ample energy, but\nwho are so desirous that they expend it extravagantly\nin overwork, so that their resources are always at a low\nebb. Samuel Butler says :\n1 \" The life of a creature is\nthe memory of a creature. We are all the same stuff to\nstart with, but we remember different things, and if we\ndid not remember different things, we should be absolutely\nlike each other. As for the stuff of which we are made,\nwe know nothing, save that it is '\nsuch as dreams are\nmade of.' \" We should add to this, however, that unless\nthe psychic energy is free to move among these memories,\nselecting one or another and inserting them into con-\nsciousness at the right moment, they might just as well\nnot exist. In a sense our well-being may be said to\ndepend upon a good rapport with the unconscious mind.\nA neurotic person is deficient in control of his psychic\nenergy. In a severe case he either cannot direct it to\nthe useful end he desires, or else he uses it in an exag-\ngerated manner. He is a victim to the phantasies formed\nin his own unconscious mind. In order to cure him, the\nanalyst has recourse to dream or phantasy material,\nwhich arises from the same source as the hysterical\nsymptoms and is of a similar nature. The symptoms\nare phantasy formations created by a displacement of\nenergy from the psychical to the physical realm, con-\nsequent on the fact that to some natures physical suffering\nis easier to bear than mental suffering, and offers an\nescape from it. The neurotic is not for one moment to\nbe regarded as inferior to other people ;\nhe is very often\n1\nLife and Habit.\n\flxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material 9\nsuperior, but more sensitive, and far too thin-skinned.\nBut lest I should seem to accuse him alone of making\nphantasies, let us remind ourselves that phantasy formation\nis a perfectly normal mechanism\u2014one may call it a\nfunction even\u2014which few of us would wish to live without.\nEvery inventor makes phantasies before he makes his\ninvention ; the philosopher does the same in the process\nof arriving at his new concepts. The business man and\nthe lover equally pave the way for their ventures with\nday-dreams ; the mother plans for the Christmas holidays\nin her phantasies. With the poet and artist their poems\nand paintings are more or less direct expressions of their\nunconscious mind. They may in a very special sense be\ncalled mediums of the subconscious. Let us see what\nShakespeare says about phantasies :\nLovers and madmen have such seething brains,\nSuch shaping fantasies that apprehend\nMore than cool reason ever comprehends.\nThe lunatic, the lover, and the poet,\nAre of imagination all compact :\nOne sees more devils than vast hell can hold ;\nThat is the madman : the lover all as frantic,\nSees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt :\nThe poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\nDoth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven ;\nAnd, as imagination bodies forth\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet's pen\nTurns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing\nA local habitation and a name.\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination,\n.That, if it would but apprehend some joy,\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy :\nOr in the night, imagining some fear,\nHow easy is a bush supposed a bear !\n1\nIt must be recognised that \" the unconscious holds the\ngerms of future conscious contents,\" 2\nand that dreams\nand phantasies, when made conscious, help us to come\n1\nMidsummer-Night's Dream, Act v. Sc. i.\n2\nJung's Conception of the Unconscious. Collected Papers, ch. xv.\n\f10 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nto our true thinking and feeling. In normal persons\nthe unconscious has the effect of softening and toning\ndown extreme conscious tendencies \" through an effective\nopposite impulse in the unconscious.\" A life that is\ndevoid of phantasy is apt to be sterile. When we say a\nman has no imagination, we recognise a defect in him.\nA case which illustrates the effects of subconscious\nphantasy is that of a Miss A., a young woman of 30.\nShe was brought to me because she had violent attacks\nof hiccoughs lasting from one hour to a whole day. She\nhad an innocent mindless expression and a high childish\nvoice. She had at one time been clever and capable, for\nat 17 she was forewoman of a room in a blouse factory,\nwhere she showed originality in designing and cutting out.\nShe exhibited the usual belle indifference to her symptom\nso characteristic of the hysteric, for though the hiccoughs\nwere of such violence as almost to jerk her off the couch\non which she was lying for my examination, she yet wore\nthe placid expression of an infant suffering from painless\neructations of wind. Her guileless baby-talk was equally\nremarkable. I was obliged to send this patient into a\nnursing home, much against her will ; and without giving\nher any other treatment I began an analysis, which was\nat first carried on every day for one hour. One of her\nearly dreams was the following :\nSomething was wrong with me, what, I did not know. I\nwas having advice from a gentleman who seemed to be a surgeon.\nHe did a lot of talking with mother. He then lifted a little\ngirl on to a wooden horse and pushed the horse and child into\na pond. The child was wearing one of my dresses. We all\nstood and watched her sail away. After that the doctor went\ninto a shop, still talking. My sister Maggie said, \" That's the\nworst of Dr. Long.\"\nHere the dream amusingly hits off the exact situation.\nWithout giving details I will just say that my patient\nidentified herself with the little girl on the horse by the\ndress she was wearing ; the surgeon was identified with\nmyself as the \" doctor who talked so much.\" The \" pond\"\nbrought up as a free association a previous dream. In\n\flxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material 11\nthis dream she was reluctantly coming to my consulting\nroom for the first time, and as she crossed the street to\nmy house a great pond spread out before her into which\nshe fell : this she had called the Slough of Despond, for\nthe thought of being treated medically filled her with\ndespair. She did not want to go to a doctor\u2014that is,\nunconsciously she did not want to get well. My talka-\ntiveness was a witty and revengeful criticism by her\nunconscious of my persuasiveness in making her come\nagainst her wish, for a second visit, and finally talking\nher into a nursing home. The pond, then, was a symbol\nfor this terrible adventure of treatment. She is accom-\npanied in the dream by her mother, and indeed by her\nwhole family, for this grown-up baby is never far, psycho-\nlogically at least, from her mother's apron strings and her\nchildhood's companions.\nThe dream gives a picture of the childishness of her\nattitude. The little wooden horse was understood to be\nher psychic energy, which was a feeble affair\u2014as unsuit-\nable to her present age of thirty as a child's toy would\nbe as a steed. The argument between the mother and\nthe surgeon represented the tempest of emotions roused\nby making her conflict conscious. The conflict was between\nher childish adaptation to her mother, and the new\ndemands made upon her that she should sacrifice the\nshelter which her symptoms had hitherto procured for\nher, and take up a new attitude to life.\nYou will see that the make-up of this dream seems very\nsimple. It is like the story you tell children when you\nwant to point a moral. The unconscious is not a moralist,\nhowever, not at least by intention, but it is a picture\nmaker, a maker of parables. The meaning of the dream\nis arrived at, not from the manifest content (that is, the\npart of the dream which is remembered, and which pro-\nbably is only a fragment of the whole), but from the\nlatent content. This latent content is to be gathered from\nthe free associations, which it is the analyst's business to\nstimulate and discuss in the time devoted to the analysis\nof the dream. The meaning of the dream lies on this\nside and on that of the threshold of consciousness. It is\n\f12 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nthe analyst's art to bring the two into juxtaposition, so\nthat understanding may come to the patient.\nEarlier in Miss A.'s case there had been an attack of\nblindness of hysterical nature. It had occurred at the age\nof 17 in this wise. She travelled backwards and forwards\ndaily to the blouse factory in the city. One evening, on\nher way home, she was alone in the carriage. As the\ntrain left the station a working man swung himself into\nthe carriage, sat opposite to her and suddenly exhibited\nhimself in an alarming and indecent way. She was rooted\nto her seat, unable to move or speak. A minute or two\nlater he swung himself out as the train slowed up to\nenter the next station, which was Miss A.'s destination.\nShe ran the three-quarters of a mile between the station\nand her home, arriving breathless and almost beside\nherself with terror and excitement. The only account she\ngave to her parents was \" that a man had followed her\nfrom whom she ran.\" Three weeks later, as she was\nexamining the work one of her girls brought for inspection,\ndarkness fell upon her. She asked, \" What has happened\nto the light ?\n\" Nothing had happened, but she had\nsuddenly become blind, and had to be led home. This\nblindness passed away in the course of a few weeks,\nalthough her sight remained inadequate, and rendered her\ncomparatively helpless for some years. She was no longer\nable to go out to work, and lost all her initiative, and though\nshe became helpful in her mother's house, could take no\nJ.\nresponsibility. She constantly had hallucinations of being\npursued ; and once, like Luther, who threw an ink-stand\nat the devil, she threw everything she had in her hands\nat an equally visionary figure which came in at her doc r .\nHer second severe psychical illness was that accompanied\nby the violent hiccoughs described. She was permanently\ncured of these within a week, and her cure has been\nlasting.\nSeveral months ago she came to me again, looking\nanxious, and told me that no less than five times in the\nprevious few weeks the kettle and saucepans had fallen\nout of her hands, the contents being spilled. The last\nincident of this kind was that she had washed up the\n\flxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material 13\ntea-cups and absent-mindedly put them into a large\nenamel jug to carry to the dresser\n\u2014\" a stupid thing,\"\nshe said, which she \"had never done before.\" Five\nminutes later she emptied the jug into the sink, smashing\nall the crockery thereby ! She also said that for several\nnights she had been wakened from sleep hearing her name\ncalled, and had gone to her friend who was ill at the\ntime and who was to her an adopted mother, saying,\n\"What did you call me for?\" But, like the infant\nSamuel, she found the voice was a subjective one. These\nacts are what is called \" symptomatic \"\u2014the result of a\nsplitting of consciousness. They shew the tricky behaviour\nof the unconscious, and have counterparts at seances.\nMy patient had been neglecting to pay proper attention\nto the workings of her unconscious mind, and her phan-\ntasies had once more got her partially in their grip.\nThey were a signal from her unconscious that she was\nin some danger of a fresh breakdown. Analysis of a few\ndreams soon brought to light the new problems which\nwere disturbing her, and helped her to get her energy on\nthe right track again. Miss A. has acquired insight enough\ninto the analytic method to realize that she must be on\nher guard and take preventive measures to avoid a\nbreakdown, whenever she is disturbed by symptomatic acts\nof the kind described. In such symptoms one is able to\nrecognise the beginnings of a psychic disease\u2014a type of\nillness upon which the use of a thermometer and the\ncounting of a pulse can throw no light.\nI now propose to give the analysis of a dream in some\ndetail. A dream may be interpreted on its objective\nor on its subjective aspect, or from both points of view,\nwhich supplement each other. The line to be followed is\nindicated by the remarks of the dreamer. On the sub-\njective side, all the personages that occur in the dream\nare dramatizations of the dreamer himself under various\naspects, more or less disguised, and all the things they\ndo and say represent different conflicting feelings or ideas\nof his. The dream characters are of the same nature as\nthe different characters that appear in cases of multiple\npersonality, or the personifications of automatic phenomena.\n\fL4 Constance E. Long, 31. D. [part\nTo demonstrate this in the interpretation of dreams is\ngenerally enlightening to the person under analysis, because\nfew people realize the simultaneous existence of opposite\nfeelings in themselves. In making the following analysis\nI asked my patient to give her free associations, taking\nthe various dream-parts as texts. In order to arrive at\nthese, the dreamer should be as passive as possible in\nregard to the ideas which come into the mind, should\nrepeat them without self-criticism, and should reject\nnothing, no matter how far-fetched or irrelevant it may\nseem. This is exceedingly difficult, though it sounds easy.\nMiss B., the dreamer, is of the intellectual type. She\nis aged 45 and has been engaged in teaching and literary\nwork. She is suffering from inability to walk any distance\nand has vague abdominal pains. She can walk about in\nthe house and in her own room with a firm elastic step,\nbut out of doors she is assailed by fears, and has to lean\nagainst supports. A distance of fifty yards seems well-\nnigh impossible to her. She has to come to my house in\na cab, a walk of some four minutes. She once took this\nwalk at my suggestion and as a consequence had a\ncollapse. She has been ill for seven years. Up to that\ntime she earned her living, and led a most praiseworthy\nlife. She was the youngest child of an unhappy marriage.\nHer father was a heedless spendthrift, her mother a\npatient Griselda, of almost saintly forbearance. The pair\nwere incompatible, and this youngest daughter, clever and\nsensitive, gradually sided with the mother, though un-\ndoubtedly most of her love was given to her father. As\nshe grew up she soon put her talents to use, and earned\nan income, which later on she devoted largely to her\nparents' support and succour. Her holidays were almost\nexclusively spent in the family home, from a sense of\nduty. Here she underwent constant anxieties, and to a\ncertain extent stood between the parents. It seemed to\nher in reviewing her life that it was one of perpetual\nsacrifice and self-less devotion.\nIn ajjpearance the lady is cpiiet and self-respecting.\nShe has a clear skin and well cut features.

Her. ^animation .springs up quickly\nin response to intellectual or iaee.'i subjects:., tier expression\nis lively. If anything offends her, she compresses her lips,\nand very angry looks sometimes dart \u2022\nfrom her eyes. This\nchange of expression indicates- rmcbi^cious feelings and\ngives one the impression of slumbering fires.\nShe brought the following dream for analysis :\nDream.\u2014I see myself in a strange room, there are people in\nit, but I do not know any of them. A gentleman of the\ncompany, who seemed to know me and to have some interest\nin me, asked me to come with him, as he wanted to shew me\na school building. I took my house shoes off and put them\nsomewhere behind the leg of a piano, and put a blanket round\nmy shoulders to go, as it appeared to be raining.\nWhen we reached the road outside, I saw on the left a\ncluster of beautiful blue-bells ; farther down the road, on the\nsame side, hung a great clump of wild broom in full flower.\nThe road and the flowers were bathed in a beautiful clear\nlight. The school building was some distance beyond the\nflowers, but we did not get to it, nor did I see it. I knew\nit was there.\nWhile we stood for a moment on the road, I saw an animal\nglide out suddenly from among the blue-bells ;\nin shape and\nsize and in its sinuous movement, though not in colour, it\nlooked at first like a weasel. A beautiful phosphorescent light\nshone right down its back. It glided swiftly across the road,\nand as it went it became much larger, and now the fight on\nits back was no longer to be seen. It settled itself down on\na low bank on the opposite side of the road with its back to\nus, and I now saw its coat was spotted greyish black and\nwhite and that it was quite a large animal. I asked what\nanimal it was, as I did not recognise it, and was told it was\na wolf, and I wondered if we had not better move away from\nits neighbourhood when I heard that.\nThere was something very sinister in the appearance of the\ncreature, as it very quietly stretched itself out, apparently\nquite oblivious of our presence, but one felt in it a certain\nindefinable something that rather expressed or betokened extreme\nwatchfulness, power and knowledge. Then it rose up slowly,\ncrossed the road back to the blue-bell clump and stood among\n\fHi Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nthe flowers ; but now it was .fi(j5 i-onger & wolf, but a low type\nwoman vath :\n<.n'm8* -hard features, a hooked nose and unplea-\nsant aspect'. Her clothes were not ragged, but plain and tidy\nand she wore a bonnet.. She; was talking to some one who\nstood near' her.- The dream ended there.\nThe following are some of the dreamer's free associations :\nPART I.\nSchool.\u2014I have been associated with schools practically all\nmy life and am interested in them. In Sweden I visited\nseveral and taught in some there. The schools in Sweden for\nthe people are infinitely better equipped than ours. I have\nvisited schools in Switzerland and in Paris, and have been\npresent at language lessons given in schools in France and\nSwitzerland. I have taught in schools in Wales and England.\nBlanket.-\u2014Suggests bed and warmth ; one would not use a\nblanket as covering for the body except in a case of great\nurgency, and where it was the only covering available, such as\nin shipwreck or fire, etc.\nHouse Shoes suggest my present pair, which are of velvet\nand very comfortable, but nearly worn out. I always like to\nwear house shoes in the house.\nPiano.\u2014Calls up the pleasure I have in being able to play\na little ; but I like a good piano and sweet and rather muffled\ntone. Playing gives my fingers something to do and in this\nway is a satisfaction and pleasure, apart from the much\ndeeper enjoyment of the music.\nPART II.\nBlue-bells.\u2014A stretch of blue-bells in spring gives me infinite\npleasure. I don't like spring to pass without having this\npleasure ; I have missed something very helpful and beautiful\nif it does. I know of many blue-bell woods, all very beautiful,\nin Wales and also in Somersetshire.\nBroom.\u2014Grows more gracefully than gorse, without prickles,\nis less common, is very beautiful in a mass, although you\nseldom see it so. White broom is more beautiful than yellow.\n\flxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material. 17\nI can think of three gardens where there is some very lovely\nwhite broom.\nPhosphorescent light. \u2014Recalls glow-worms and fire-flies. I have\nseen the former in Ireland. This particular light strikes you\nas different from any other light you have ever seen. I have\nnoticed it on old tree stumps. \"I have translated a fairy story\nfrom the Swedish in which hobgoblins used rotten tree stumps\nfor lights.\nWolf.\u2014Hungry, fierce, cruel. I have seen wolves only in\nZoos ; have translated stories from the Swedish in which wolves\nfigure largely ;\nbelong to cold northern climates now.\nBrowning has written a striking poem, Ivan Ivanovitch, in\nwhich a mother throws her children one by one out of a\nsledge to the wolves, so that she might escape herself.\nGreyish black and white coloured coat.\u2014Does not suggest a\nwolf ; colours out of place ; I like a decided black and white.\nWoman low type.\u2014I saw a woman of this type at a railway\nstation in London some months ago ; such a face repels and\nsaddens me.\nThe telling of this dream with its free associations\noccupied the first part of the analytical hour, which I\nam briefly describing. The latter part of the time was\ntaken up in weaving the dream parts and their associations\ninto one fabric in order to obtain the interpretation.\nAs this proceeding goes along, fresh-springing associations\nare added by the dreamer, and some analogies may be\nintroduced by the analyst (the hermeneutical method) 1\nfrom history, mythology or experience.\nThe dream related gives, through its analysis, the patient's\nsubconscious view of the present situation, and of her\nimmediate problems and her own psychological attitude.\nIt exhibited her orientation, for hitherto we only knew\nshe was ill and in need of treatment, other treatments\nhaving failed to cure her. We knew that her illness was\nmore psychical than physical ;\nwe could see she was a\nconscientious person, with a somewhat saint-like character ;\nbut without such a dream one would hardly know where\nto begin to work.\n1\nSee Jung's Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology, 2nd edition.\nB\n\fis Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nShe is in a strange room,1\nas indeed she is here in London ;\nthere are other people in it ; she knows none, that is, she\ndoes not personally know anyone who has been analysed\n;\nshe would \" like to know what effect it has on others.\"\nA gentleman who seemed to have some interest in her\nshows her the school building. The analyst is interested\nto shew her something she has never seen before, that is,\nher unconscious ;\nanalysis is a \" new school.\"\nShe makes her preparations ; she takes off her soft house\nshoes ;\nthey are indeed nearly worn out. This tendency\nof hers to keep indoors is hard on her slippers, which are\nso comfortable. She finds she ought to put off these\ncomfortable outworn habits to go outside to the road\u201e\nThis brings an association with the command to\nMoses, \" Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the\nplace whereon thou standest is holy ground.\" This gives\na solemn and religious aspect to the visit to the school\nbuilding, that is, to her new effort at analytical under-\nstanding. She puts the shoes behind a leg of the piano.\nThe piano is an apt symbol of expression ; she prefers\nher sweet sounds \" muffled.\"\nShe \" plays a little.\" The piano at her lodging is poor\nand jangling and out of tune, so that the music she can\nproduce just now is not satisfying. The \" finger exercise\n\"\nrepresents extraversion ; the \" deeper enjoyment \" intro-\nversion. All the harmonies of her life are muffled. The\nputting of the shoes behind the piano is a make-shift\naffair. Things are not in their right proportion ; how could\na piano leg hide a pair of shoes ? It is easier to live a\nhalf-invalided life than to take up a drastic new attitude.\nLike her slippers, she feels \" worn out \" ; but this is\nequivalent to \" shipwreck,\" and that she thinks it so\n(subconsciously) is shown by her use of a blanket as\ncovering ; it is an occasion of \" great urgency.\" This adds\nto the notion of a religious call, a sense of desperate\npersonal need. The blanket has the significance of some-\nthing comfortable taken from her bed ; she \"loves warmth \"\n;\nher ill-health has made her spend much time in bed, and\n1\nThe italics here refer to items in the dream, the inverted commas to\nitems of the associations.\n\fx,xxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material. 19\nvalue her comforts. She feels now like one who has lost\nher all in storm or fire. She is indeed an invalid and\nmight expect shelter, and yet she has to go out in the rain\n'to see a new school building. The demand of analysis is\nthat she should take up life again. She consciously\nacquiesces up to a point, but the dream shows her to be\nwearing the blanket, a symbol of her invalid life, which\nshe carries with her on her new venture.\nThe school building xvas at some distance beyond the\nflowers. Much had to be seen, experienced and under-\nstood before it was reached. The flowers were inter-\npreted as phantasies ; the school is \" beyond.\" Will the\ngoal be reached ? That is always the problem ; has one\nenough patience and perseverance to get beyond the\nphantasies to the real working place ? The dream puts\nthe question but does not answer it. The school building\nhad come up in former dreams as a place where she had\ndone educational work, which had been rebuilt, and which\nshe was re-visiting. It is something new on an old founda-\ntion. Perhaps what analysis requires of her is not alto-\ngether new, only a reconstruction and a fresh attitude to\nlife. The new building is an improvement on the old ;\nthat much is clear. She knows that we must assimilate\nthe new by means of the old, for until we can do this,\nwe cannot accept the new, although the old no longer\nserves us. Until we can accept the new emotionally, our\nthoughts carry no conviction and supply no power. Thus\nshe must bring over into the new life the blanket that is\nso ill adapted to her new purposes. She will throw it\naway only when she is able to face the new requirements.\nThe road outside goes through beautiful bluebells and is\nbathed in beautiful clear light. These are the pretty\nphantasies she loves so much about herself and life.\nThey are \" beautiful,\" but danger lurks in them too.\nThese spring flowers suggest new springing hope.\nBroom was there, too, and the rarest kind, white broom.\nShe \" prefers it to gorse.\" It is typical that what is\nbeautiful in her eyes is \" rarer, more graceful and without\nprickles.\" This sensitive soul would like her roses without\nspines. Be it noted that broom suggests gorse in the\n\f20 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nassociations. That is a contrast of smooth and prickly.\nThere is the idea of opposites in the associations with the\ncolour of the wolf's coat, which was spotted greyish black\nand white. The dreamer likes \" a decided black and\nwhite.\" Black and white represent evil and good. She\nhas always wanted to separate the one from the other.\nIndeed has she not done this in following the path of\nsacrifice ? What else could she have done ? This clear-\ncut attitude has repeatedly made her turn away from\nanything that is dubious and dangerous in life and revert\nto the known and approved. It has led her to adopt the\npath of sacrifice as \" white,\" and reject all that is unknown,\nall her natural desires for herself, as \" black.\" This atti-\ntude has always led her back to the parental home, no\nmatter how unhappy that return made her. She had\nnever risked spending on herself, or living her own life,\nbecause who could tell where it might lead ? Suppose\nthere was \" a hungry wolf \" inside one, how dangerous\nthat might be ! We may call to mind here the legend\nof St . Francis and the wolf of Agobio. This hungry wolf\nwas causing grief in the little town, robbing and killing.\nThe saint went out to it, struck a bargain with it, tamed\nit, converted and led it home, turned it into a friend of\nthe poor, and it became a guardian of the town. There\nis a kind of goodness that tames the animal nature by\naccepting it, and dealing with it ;\nby uniting with it in\nfriendship. This surely is the meaning of this legend.\nBut for our dreamer \" white \" is the safe colour. It\nis the colour of etherialized saints, of brides, and little\nchildren. She can keep herself pure and uninitiated and\ninfantile by an invariable choice of white. But it does\nnot really succeed. To remain spotless means to cut\noneself off from real life and live in phantasies. Phantasies,\nhowever, have a way of running off with one, of suddenly\nbecoming dangerous, that is, if one begins to live in them,\nand the real pains, incidental to life in the real world,\nwhich one avoids, may push surrogates of themselves into\nconsciousness in the form of neurotic symptoms, such as\ndisability to walk, or vague abdominal aches and pains,\nwhich are alarming and penalising.\n\fLxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material. 21\nMiss B., whenever a choice is presented, decides to live\nfor her parents. She identifies herself with her suffering\nmother, and bears the burden of her father's vices as\nthough she were herself his wife. In thinking thus of\nothers, she avoids thinking of herself, and evades that\ngreatest of all problems in life\u2014the acceptance of personal\nfreedom and the necessity of learning to use it. This, in\nother words, is the task of developing her individuality.\nTimid natures, such as hers, unconsciously refuse indivi-\ndual thinking and feeling, and shirk the problems of love,\nwhich naturally arise and require enterprise and responsi-\nbility for their full acceptance. Miss B. thinks she is\nfreely selecting a path of self-sacrifice. Her unconscious\nmotive is that she prefers to remain a child ; she cannot\naccept the temptations of freedom. She would ever\nremain with the \" white,\" which she believes to be the\ngood.\nBut the dream tells us the reason for this. Unknown\nthere is an animal lurking. Out of the bed of the shelter\nof blue-bells darts a stealthy creature in the form of a\nweasel with a beautiful phosphorescent light down its back.\nIt crosses from one side of the road to the other. It\nturns its back to her, as though disregarding the con-\nventions, or so that it may be seen in all aspects. It\nincreases in size as it moves and becomes a wolf, and\nfinally returns to the blue-bell clump ; and behold it has\nnow turned into a woman of low type. It is a land of\nwerewolf.\nIn looking at the woman the dreamer knows she is\nlooking at a representation of herself. Her clothes are\nplain and tidy, she wore a bonne*. She herself is neat and\nplainly dressed. The bonnet is a sign of middle age.\nThe unpleasant aspect explains these darting expressions of\nill-feeling and malice that rise up so unexpectedly from\nher unconscious from time to time.\nThe beautiful phosphorescent light has the effect of a\nmagic illumination. It reminds her of the torches used\nby fairies which are symbolic of the light of the phantasies ;\nit reminds her of the inexplicable baffling insect light\nshown by the glowworm and fire-fly\u2014these humble things\n\f22 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nwhich are so wonderful and illuminating. This is the light\nthat belongs to the subconscious view of things. It is\n\" different from any other light.\" It is not the light of\nthe intellect, but non-rational rather than rational in\ncharacter.\nThis analysis by no means exhausts the dream and its\nassociations, but it must serve as an example of the way\nthe work proceeds. It is carried on by means of a\nbackward and forward conversation, which follows the\npatient's lead as closely as possible.\nWhat is most remarkable in the dream and analogous\nmaterial is its character as compensatory to the conscious\nthinking. 1\nThis of necessity throws light on the daily\nproblems. One is working in what Gilbert Murray calls\n\" the uncharted region of the mind,\" 2\nwhich contains all\nthe germinal material that may ultimately become con-\nscious, and from which art and religion emanate.\nThe dream itself may in a sense be regarded as a\nprimitive form of art, sometimes crude, sometimes mature.\nThe instance just given is clear and bold allegory, pro-\nvocative of deep emotion in the dreamer and, when under-\nstood, capable of giving rise to a new set of values and\nproviding the motive force for a reconstruction of life.\nBut though the dream is valuable as a stimulus, this is\nnot all that is wanted. It supplies only part of the\nmotive for conduct, the other part must come from the\nconscious reason and the will. The patient in this case\nhad been overthrown by her unconscious and had taken\nher phantastic view of life for reality. Now in analysis\nwe go to the very source of her overthrow and learn\nwisdom from it ; we now use the phantasies that formerly\nmade use of her.\nThe patient whose dream I have given is not unique\nin her breakdown. She represents complexes and con-\nflicts to which all are subject. How to effect a compromise\nwith life in its two aspects is a common human difficulty,\nbut we do not all break down over it. Perhaps a tem-\nporary experience of neuroses would have a beneficial effect\n1\nNicoll, Dream Psychology, chapter vi.\n2\nGilbert Murray, Four Stages of Greek Religion.\n\fxxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material. 23\non many of us. It would teach us to sympathise with\nothers and help us to realize there is no precisely normal\nreaction, no exactly right path.\nOur dreamer's \" high has proved too high, her heroic\nfor earth too hard.\" For her the lowering of her standard\nwould increase the possibilities of life. In order to main-\ntain her one-sided attitude, she has pushed all she takes\nto be evil into the unconscious and disguised it with\nphantasies ; and in doing this she has sacrified her own\ndevelopment. Her ideal of perfection has kept her childish.\nThe animal has magic in it ; that is the strange light it\ncarries. This power for good or ill is at present only in\nthe unconscious ; and her emotional life is limited because\nof its repression. Her symptoms represent her repressed\nfeelings.\nPrimitive man embodies the idea which I wish to con-\nvey in his attitude to his totem animal. He eats it to\nobtain its \" mana \" or virtue, its life-force or magic, and\nthereby enchances his own personality. The dream is on\nthe level of \" totemistic thinking \" and expresses the notion\nof vital force under the symbol of the wolf, which later\nbecomes incorporated in the woman. So Miss B.'s next\nstep must be to obtain the \" mana \" from her animal\nnature. She must recognise that side of herself, pay\nattention to it, and consciously abstract from it what\nis useful to herself and to humanity. She will thus\naccpiire forcefulness and an extension of her personality\nand bring about that co-operation between good and evil,\nspiritual and animal, white and black, without which no\nlife can be lived satisfactorily.\nTo act \" nobly,\" according to a standard of virtue\nwhich she has not independently thought out and adopted\nfor herself, is useless for one who has already broken\ndown under such an attempt ; it does not work. What\nwe want is to be as effective as possible on a level\nsuitable to our capacity, and to live as free from neurosis\nor any other hampering manifestation as may be. The\ndifficulty for each is to cut his coat according to his\ncloth, to find out what suits his special nature, to make a\nharmonious compromise. It does not do to be a saint or\n\f24 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nmartyr in the conscious, and a werewolf in the unconscious.\nSuch an attitude is bound sooner or later to be no longer\nsupportable. The more sensitive and valuable the character,\nthe graver the conflict.\nDreams have been denied a moral meaning ; I cannot\nbut think this is an error. In no department of human\nactivity can an ethical bearing be excluded. The moral\nmeaning is not, however, to be found in the dream alone.\nIt would be dangerous to take a dream too literally or\nconcretely ; but it supplies the view missing to conscious-\nness\u2014missing because painful to consciousness. The\nmeaning is to be found only through the work of the\nconscious upon the unconscious.\nThe dream just analysed is chosen on account of its\ngeneral character. A trained analyst will find other\nmeanings than those given ; the patient herself as time\nwent on found other important meanings and associations.\nIt has been said that the whole of a life might be revealed\nfrom one dream, if the associations were followed suffi-\nciently freely and far ; but no dream can be exhaustively\nanalysed, especially in public.\nBefore I myself had analysed dreams and become\nfamiliar with some aspects of the subconscious mind, I\nfound examples of dream analysis very unconvincing, and\nI cannot hope that my own attempt will prove less so.\nOne cannot recapture all the delicate threads of the con-\nversation, and portray the subtle reactions that made it\npossible to bring the material above the threshold of\nconsciousness ; and when once the material is in con-\nsciousness and is so obvious, it seems as if it must have\nbeen there all the time. The dream gives a concrete\npicture of an incident that at first sight may not be\ninteresting even to the dreamer. It seems meaningless\ntill the free associations shew it to have a symbolical\nmeaning. The emotions attached to it belong to the\npsychological problems which also occupy the dreamer in\nthe day, and the symbols selected are singularly apt,\nand often witty. An example of a witty dream is the\nfollowing, which was reported to me. I do not know the\ndreamer. It ran :\n\" Some people travel by boat, some by\n\flxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material. 25\nrail, but I always travel by Virginia creeper.\" We can\nall make a guess at the latent content of this dream, and\nin so doing we shall all interpret it differently. What it\nactually meant to the dreamer can only be known when\nher free associations are forthcoming.\nI will now give an instance of phantasy production in\nwhich I think some credulous people would be inclined\nto see the appearance of a spirit, but which to the\nanalytical student, and most members of the S.P.R.\nwould have quite another interpretation. A certain Mrs. C.\nhad a hypnagogic vision. It was the head of a young\nwoman with a peculiar and striking face. The key-note\nof the expression was sad. The face appeared on a grey\nmisty background. Mrs. C. woke from this vision with a\nfeeling of sorrow. On going to sleep again she saw the\nsame head in a dream. This time it was a dead face.\nAs the dreamer gazed at it the eyes opened and looked\nlevelly forward. Mrs.C. woke up weeping, and the memory\nof the hypnagogic vision and the dream caused her acute\ndistress when she recalled it during the foliowhig day.\nUnknown to Mrs. C, then or since, the woman whom she\nrecognised in the dream had died a few days previously\nin tragic circumstances, and her body was still unburiecl.\nMrs. C. had seen her but three times, then not to speak\nto and only for a moment. She had consciously thought\nher ill and sad-looking, and her striking appearance had\nroused a passing curiosity. One association with the dead\nface in the dream was of a thorn-crowned head of Christ\npainted or printed on linen, in which the eyes appear\nto open as the gazer approaches the picture. Another\nassociation was of a so-called mystical painting, in which\na cross appeared, which it was claimed had never been\nput there by the painter. Thus the head in the dream\nrepresented sorrow, despair and death, and also sacrifice\nand crucifixion.\nAll these emotions belonged to the immediate life prob-\nlem of the dreamer, and her unconscious mind with\nremarkable sureness had selected, out of hundreds of\nindifferent faces seen in the previous few days, just the\nvery one that poignantly symbolized her own particular\n\f26 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nsufferings. This appearance of the dead in the dream is\na coincidence that we must necessarily come across when\nwe observe unconscious phenomena, just as we find it in\nany group of conscious imenomena. It is obvious that\nthe dream must be attributed to a reminiscence of the\ndreamer's, rather than to any supposed action of the\ndead person. What analysis adds to the view of its\nsubjective origin is that it has a meaning discoverable\nby the dreamer, as representative of certain unconscious\nthoughts or wishes.\nThose who have read reports of seances are often struck\nwith the occasional banalities of the so-called controls.\nThey serve to strengthen the supposition that the pheno-\nmena in question are emanations from the unconscious\nmind of the medium, and possibly of the sitters through\nthe medium. The material of dreams is often quite as\ntrivial, but we recognize that it has no concrete value\n\u2014only a symbolical one. In analysis the conscious mind\nis brought to bear upon it critically in order to wrest\nvalues from it, as one washes away mud to find the gold\nore. This critical attitude gradually brings about a change\nin the character of the material produced.\nDuring analysis the work done on the unconscious by\nthe conscious mind continues to force fresh material above\nthe threshold. Examples may be given which treat of\nthe relation between the analyst and the analysed person.\nIncidentally they show how humorous the unconscious is.\nE.g., a lady expressed feelings of parsimony in the following\nway : She dreamed that she was being fitted by a Bond\nStreet tailor for a coat and skirt ; she regretted she had\nnot bought it before the tailor had removed to this\nexpensive address, as he had made them just as well\nat half the cost when he lived at Surbiton. This actually\nrefers to the recent removal of the physician from a\nsuburb into the area of consulting practice. She could\nhave paid smaller fees if she had consulted him before\nhis removal.\nAnother patient ended a spell of analysis with a wish\nto establish friendly relations with the doctor. This did\nnot seem possible. She dreamed that she was on an\n\flxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material. 27\nisland. A beautiful dolphin visited her on government\nbusiness. As he swims away she feels very sad, and\nnotices that his tail is studded with yellow discs. They\nare of shining metal, and strengthen the tail as a band of\nmetal strengthens the blade of an oar. The analysis\nshewed the metal discs to represent golden guineas, sym-\nbolic of the cash nexus which she now feels to be the\nsole bond between her and the doctor, and which she\ntries to rejoice over, on the ground of cash being necessary\nto his well-being.\nThe analyst often turns up in his patient's dream under\nany guise that fits the situation of the moment. In a\nsingle day the dreams of various patients might depict\nhim as : (1) a j^oliceman, representing a guardian of law\nor a helper ; (2) a siren, one who draws into danger ;\n(3) a ship's stoker, one who attends to the invisible\nsources of energy ; (4) a gardener, one who cultivates\ngrowing thoughts and feelings, or who prunes bushes, and\nnurtures seeds ; (5) a piece of jewelry, which may be either\nprecious or a sham ; (6) the Kaiser, one who makes bom-\nbastic assertions. Every symbol would have its special\nmeaning for the moment, and would be changed in the\ncourse of analysis as rapidly as the mental attitude\nchanges. Though in each case the analyst is meant\nobjectively by these characters, they have a subjective\nmeaning as well, standing for something in the dreamer's\npsyche.\nThe analysed person appears to himself under innumer-\nable guises. His ambition may be symbolized by Alex-\nander, his power by Jove, his patience by Job, his piety\nor sexuality by monk or nun, his self-depreciation by a\ncringing dog, his temper by Xantippe, his greed by a\nravening wolf, his childishness by a sucking pig, and so\nforth. The problems with which the dream is concerned\nare curiously veiled, not for purposes of concealment\nmerely, but because the subconscious naturally thinks in\nterms different from the conscious, and is trying to solve\nproblems by seeking analogies. The dream is a means of\nexpression. It is, according to Jung, \" the subliminal\npicture of the psychological condition of the individual\n\f28 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nin his waking state.\" It is also a fact that the subcon-\nscious view of a problem is often different from the\nconscious one. Just as the day-dream offers a relief from\nthe hard facts of reality, so the night-dream refreshes us\nwith the opposite point of view, or points out our error\nin a picture. The dream is a source of wisdom, as we\nall unconsciously admit when we leave some knotty\nproblem over night with the words, \" let us sleep upon\nit.\"\nSometimes we find that the psychological problems are\nbrought up under a recurring dream character. This\npersonification persists until the problems connected with\nit disappear\u2014till \" the ghost is laid \" in fact, not by\nmagic but by development, by assimilating into conscious-\nness the repressed elements which the dream-character in\nquestion represents. Let me illustrate. Miss X., a kind-\nhearted woman of forty, with the benevolent feelings of\na social worker, was generous-minded and affectionate, but\nshe was also slangy and aggressive, and unconsciously\ninconsiderate of the feelings of others with a different\noutlook on life. In some respects she had the psychology\nof an open-hearted public schoolboy of sixteen, who is\nwell-intentioned, but does not think. In her dreams the\nfollowing character appears again and again under slightly\ndifferent guises ; each guise embodying some special point\na propos to the occasion of the dream. The character is\na youth\u2014like a Greek youth, and rather like the Faun\nof Praxiteles. He is more like a natural and kindly\nanimal than a man. He might be mentally or morally\ndefective, but is quite amiable and gay. He has a\nromantic appreciation of feminine charm. He appears\nunder the following circumstances :\n(1) A policeman comes to arrest him good-temperedly and\nput him where he can do no harm.\n(2) He was sent up to Cambridge, but only wasted his time.\nNow he is going to have another try.\n(3) Miss X.'s father helps her to capture him when he \" runs\namok \" in the house and is a danger. Once caught, he can be\n\" put on his honour.\"\n\fjLXXV.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material. 29\n(4) He comes home as a semi-prodigal and joins family\nprayers, but is allowed to look at a picture book.\n(5) Returned from the hunt, he sticks his legs up on an Inn\ntable, whereupon the company, shocked at his manners, proceed\nto hunt him.\n(6) He wakes up and is terribly frightened to find himself\nalone.\n(7) As \" Sir Pompey Briseas \"\u2014Breezy Ass\u2014he is required\nto enter into an estate and manage a property. He hates\nlaving to do it.\nThis character reappeared until the unconscious trends\nsymbolized were fully acknowledged, and the attitude\nabandoned\u2014at least in intention, for it takes time to\nwork the change. Such an unconscious attitude creates\nmany difficulties in life, puzzling the patient, who is apt\nto think these difficulties are owing to faults of others.\nHer conduct is influenced, none the less that the irrespon-\nsible side is under repression, and in this case concealed\nby enthusiastic interests in life. Here I may add that\nthe sex of a dream personification matters little\u2014male\nmay stand for female and vice versa. The symbol most\nappropriate will be selected, regardless of sex, or because\nof it, as the case may be. This should not surprise\nus, because every normal human being contains elements\nof both sexes, not only biologically, but also psycho-\nlogically.\nI will next give an example of a cryptic word which\noccurred in a dream, in the making of which a great\ncondensation of dream ideas has taken place. Here I\nmust again remind you that the remembered dream is\nthe manifest content only. As Freud says, \" The first\nthing that becomes clear to the investigator in the com-\nparison of the dream content with the dream thoughts\nis that a tremendous work of condensation has taken\nplace. The dream is reserved, paltry, and laconic, when\ncompared with the range and copiousness of the dream\nthoughts.\" I do not propose to relate the dream, but\nwill merely give the word and the associations attached\nto it, supplied by the dreamer. I may say the dreamer\n\f30 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nwas Welsh and a speaker of Welsh. She saw on a door-\nplate the word :\nAnwlwimdwy.\nAnwl\u2014was a Welsh word meaning \" dear.\"\nDwy\u2014meant \" two,\" or feminine.\nWy\u2014(1) a common ending for names of places :\n(2) the last syllable in her mother's name :\n(3) the first syllable in her sister's name :\n(4) a word meaning \" egg.\"\nLwm=\"lum,\" part of the names of two people of whom\nshe thought, giving associations.\nWlwin =cwlwin\u2014meant \" a knot.\"\nNwl=niwl\u2014meant \"a frog.\"\nMdwy==nodrwy\u2014meant \"a ring.\"\nEnglish words gave the following associations :\nAnwl = annul, null and void.\nWmdwy\u2014Humpty Dumpty, the Liberal Party, Anti-suffrage,\nLum =Lump.\nFollowing these items back to early reminiscences, she\nrecollects that at the age of nine she associated with three\nchildren whose names all began with W., and now noticed\nthat in Anwl, Wm, Dwy, there are three W.'s, and Wy\nsuggests the name of two of them, but the third has no\nletter beyond the W. Every one of the foregoing associ-\nations led to important dream thoughts. The word\nAnwlwimdwy, then, is merely the form that conceals the\nlatent content. It is a symbolic picture, embodying\npsychological problems, a language of signs which has the\nsignificance of shorthand. Analysis finds the associations,\nshewing subtle symbolic connections between the form and\nits contents ; these connections represent the dream thoughts.\nAnother short dream shewing similar mechanisms occurred\nto a middle-aged man, who was thinking of proposing to\na lady who lived in Highgate. He was feeling dashed by\nrecent experiences and was inclined to give up his quest.\nAs he woke one morning he caught this fleeting dream :\n\"Archie Hemel H.em\\Me&.\" The associations with Archie\nwere : an ingenuous youth ; the railway arch ;\nArchway\n\flxxv.] Psychoanalytic Use of Subliminal Material. 31\nTavern ;\nHighgate Archway ; the way to Highgate\u2014this\nwas the way to the lady of course ! Hemel\u2014Himmel =\nHeaven. \" What is the German for saddle (he continued\nin associating), and for a camel's hump, which is not a\ndefect, but is useful to ride on ?\n\" Hempsted was a\ncombination of Hampstead and Hemel Hempsted\u2014two\nplaces associated in the dreamer's mind with successfully\nwedded couples who are free and natural people. His\nmixed attitude to this problem of marriage, needing such\ncourage on the part of our timid dreamer, is well shewn\nin the camel's hump\u2014\" having the hump.\" The question\nabout the German for saddle means : won't he be saddled ?\nbut will it not be Himmel ? etc., etc. I need not elaborate\nfurther.\nWhen dreams and phantasies fail, as they occasionally\ndo in analysis, there is either conscious material to work\nupon, or other subconscious products, such as verses,\ndrawings, paintings, or models. All is grist that comes\nto the analytical mill. A certain patient brings me a\nkind of shorthand drawings, which analyse out very use-\nfully. They are extremely abstract forms, sometimes mere\nlines or curves, representing germinal thoughts or feelings ;\nthey are not unlike some scribblings I have seen in Miss\nJohnson's accounts of Mrs. Holland's scripts. One comes\nto believe that nearly every one is capable of some form\nof primitive art, and that it, like the facade of the dream,\nis a fruit of the symbolic function of the unconscious\nmind. I have also a number of little statuettes done in\nplasticine, produced by a woman during analysis. She had\nnever done anything of this kind before ; but these things\nare not to be appraised for their artistic merit, though\nwe do occasionally find evidences of real art in a latent\nor nascent state.\nI may say that any effort to force an interpretation of\nsubliminal material falls flat. The intelligent patient will\nhave none of it. When the material is rightly handled,\nthe more obvious and simple truths go home at once, for\nthe reason, as Jung 1 says, that the analyst \"has a con-\nfederate in the patient's unconscious.\" Analytical work\n1\nThe Conception of the Unconscious.\n\f32 Constance E. Long, M.D. [part\nfollows laws and demands a technique. The training which\nanalysis gives in the observation of unconscious phenomena\ngreatly deepens the individual's rapport with his own\nunconscious and so brings his other side into closer union\nwith his consciousness. The Swiss school advises that after\nan analysis, the patient should remain in touch with his\nunconscious, that is, by paying attention to it and carrying\non his own analysis to the best of his ability. \" The\nreal end of analysis is reached when the patient has\nattained adequate knowledge of the methods by which\nhe can remain in such contact, and apply its results to\nhis life.\" The problem is to adapt oneself continually,\nwith an increasing degree of success, to the external\nworld. It is natural to make efforts to overcome the\nobstacles in life to a certain degree. When the obstacles\nare too great, and the man gives up trying to overcome\nthem, the energy that should have been thus used turns\ninstead to j)roducing emotional disturbances, physical and\nmental. It is imperative that a rational solution of the\npatient's conflicts should be found, and they should be\nfound by the patient himself. For the aim of analysis\nis to leave the jmtient morally responsible. It helps him\nto discover where his energy flows most easily, and to\nfind the path in life where he can be most truly at one\nwith himself. When he has learnt to find the latent values\nin himself, he is generally more tolerant and harmonious\nin his relations with other people and with the external\nworld in general. It is with this important aim of unifying\nthe personality that we make analytical use of subliminal\nmaterial.\n\fLXXV.] Dream -Analysis. 33\nII.\nDREAM-ANALYSIS.\nBy Alice Johnson.\nIntroduction.\nI have long been convinced that the Society for Psychical\nResearch could not afford to neglect the study of psycho-\nanalysis. It may be remembered that Dr. Freud's early\nwork was referred to more than once in Mr. Myers's\narticles on the subliminal consciousness, 1\nwhile a lengthy\nnotice of Drs. Breuer and Freud's Studien iiber Hysterie\nwas included in Human Personality (Vol. I. pp. 50-56)\nMr. Myers had a remarkable faculty for recognising what\nwas important and significant in any fresh field of research,\nand if he had lived, would, I have no doubt, have made\nhimself fully acquainted with the subject and considered\nits bearings on psychical research.\nFrom 1910 onwards, some valuable discussions of psycho-\nanalysis have been contributed to the Proceedings by\nDr. Mitchell and Dr. Woolley,2\nbesides an important\n1 Proceedings S.P.R. Vol. IX. p. 12 (1893); Journal S.P.R, Vol. VIII.\np. 55 (1897).\n2 \" Some Recent Developments in Psychotherapy,\" by T. W. Mitchell,\nM.D., Proc.

[part\npaper by Dr. Freud himself on \" The Unconscious in\nPsychoanalysis \" (Proc. Vol. XXVI. p. 312).\nThe present paper attempts to deal with certain limited\naspects only of the subject through the detailed analysis\nof a few of the writer's own dreams by the psycho-\nanalytic \" method of association.\"\nIt is a tenet of psychoanalysis that all the incidents\nof a dream stand for events significant for the dreamer,\nand that all the dream-characters are dramatisations of\ndifferent aspects of himself, his varying feelings, conflicting\nimpulses, and so on ; so that if any one dream could be\ncompletely analysed and interpreted, it would give a\npicture of the man's whole inner self. The primary aim\nof psychoanalysis is to gain an insight into the personality\nof the dreamer through studying his dreams from their\npersonal and especially from their emotional side, as\ndescribed in Dr. Long's paper above ; and the knowledge\nthus acquired is often used with great success for thera-\npeutical purposes. But it is also possible to analyse\ndreams on the lines rather of pure psychology, and to\ntreat the results, as is done here, in a less personal and\nmore objective manner, which has perhaps a more direct\nbearing on psychical research.\nThe analysis seems to show that many more thoughts\nand ideas are involved in the dream than appear in\nthat part of it which is consciously remembered (its\n\" manifest \" content) ; and an attempt is made to discover\nhow these underlying ideas (its \" latent \" content) are\nconcealed, and to what cause or principle of mental\naction they owe their concealment.\nIn some automatic scripts also obscurities occur, which,\nthough sometimes accidental, at other times appear to be\ndeliberate. This is manifest in some scripts that have\nbeen discussed in the Proceedings. If therefore we can\nobtain any light on the causes of obscurities in dreams, it\nmay help us to understand the psychology of automatic script.\nFrom a psychological point of view, dreams resemble\nartistic or literary compositions, with the peculiarity that\nthey are composed by the dreamer's subliminal for him-\nself, and are addressed exclusively to himself. Thus,\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis 35\nthey are more like poetry than prose ;\nfor, roughly\nspeaking, poetry is a mode of self-expression, whereas\nprose is better adapted for conveying facts to other\npeople. Since the poet wishes to express his own ideas\nrather than to make himself plain to others, it is\nenough for him to use a descriptive epithet instead of\na name, or an allusion or image instead of a simple\nstatement of fact. Yet even in the most subjective poetry\nhe does not completely ignore his readers ; at the back\nof his mind he must to some extent be addressing him-\nself to them. In a dream, on the other hand, the dreamer\nis, as it were, talking to himself and cannot possibly\nbe overheard. He is therefore entirely absolved from\nthe necessity of making himself clear to anybody else.\nSo, if we wish to understand either imaginative literature\n(including poetry and myths), or dreams, we must take\nthe trouble to note the metaphors or allusions used by\nthe poet or dreamer, and try to find out the underlying\nthoughts or feelings which he attaches to them, and\nwhich presumably have determined his selection of them.\nThe general analogies between myths and dreams\nhave been pointed out by many writers,\u2014mythologists\nand philosophers, 1\nas well as psychologists. The myth\nstarts, we may suppose, as a simple story of a single\ninteresting event. The story, as it passes from mouth\nto mouth, gradually picks up the features of other similar\nevents and becomes a collective or composite story of\nmany incidents telescoped into one. Then, as men's\nminds become more and more capable of apprehending\nabstract ideas, the composite story may be interpreted\nin a metaphorical or allegorical way. So some primitive\nand barbaric myth, by the gradual accretion of associa-\ntions and emotions that have gathered round it in the\ncourse of many generations,\u2014who found in it, some one\nthing, and some another, answering to their own feelings,\n\u2014\ncomes to have an immense and growing appeal to all\nclasses of mankind and plays a great part in the mental\nevolution of the race.\n1\nSee, e.g., an interesting discussion in Prof. J. A. Stewart's Myths oj\nPlato, pp. 4-8.\n\f36 Alice Johnson. [part\nIn much the same way that the history\u2014both physical\nand mental\u2014of the race repeats or telescopes itself in\nthe history of the individual, the mental history of the\nindividual may in some cases apparently repeat or tele-\nscope itself in a single dream, which seems to run through\nthe whole gamut of the dreamer's experience, representing\nat the same time the most infantile and the most advanced\nstages of his personality. On the infantile element,\nwhich comes out clearly in most of the dreams analysed\nbelow, much stress has been laid by psychoanalysts,\nwho maintain that the dream-state represents a return\nto the primeval.\nThere can, I think, be little doubt that at least some\ndreams are, like myths, allegorical. Others are probably\nnothing more than a literal reproduction\u2014a mere repetition\nin memory\u2014of past experiences, real or imaginary, or are\nsimply rambling and incoherent. But the present dis-\ncussion deals only with dreams of the allegorical type,\n\u2014\nwith those, that is, in which a meaning other than what\nappears on the surface has been detected. In comparing\nsuch dreams with myths, we observe that while the\nnarrator of a myth presumably intends to indicate or\nsuggest the ideas underlying it, the dream is sometimes\nmore like a riddle ; on the face of it, it looks as if the\nperson who propounded the riddle did not wish it to be\nguessed, or at least wished to make it difficult to guess.\nFreud, as is well known, believes the concealment of\nmeaning to be intentional ;\nhe puts it down to the action\nof his hypothetical \" Censor,\" who, on his theory, distorts\nthe ideas of the dream-self because they are such as\nwould annoy or disgust the waking self if they were\nopenly expressed.\nBefore accepting this theory, it seems to me we should\nconsider how far the imperfect recollection of dreams\nmay not account for their obscurity. All we know about\nthe dream must be founded on the conscious recollection\nof it after waking,\u2014after, that is, a definite break in\nconsciousness which has probably caused much of it to\nbe forgotten. We are often aware that we have forgotten\nmany dreams, and many portions of dreams, for there\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 37\nare often dissociations of consciousness within the course\nof the dream itself. We may compare it to a cinemato-\ngraph film with large pieces torn out, which makes it\ndifficult to understand what subjects are represented.\nBut the one and only spectator of the show (i.e. the\ndreamer of the dream) is the designer of the film, and\nhe-\u2014if he can recover the recollection of it\u2014will under-\nstand its meaning. Other people can only make guesses\nat it, from his description of the fragments.\nThe dreamer must retain in his subliminal consciousness\nthe recollection of the whole dream and of his thoughts\nabout it at the time, and any view of the dream that\nconflicts with this will probably be confronted with\nfeelings of dissatisfaction arising from the subliminal.\nOn the other hand, when the dreamer feels convinced\nthat the solution he has found is the right one\u2014at\nleast as far as it goes\u2014it seems probable that the sub-\nliminal is satisfied too, or else it would make some protest.\nFreudians would not, I imagine, accept this view,\nbecause they would hold that it ignores the action of\nthe \" Censor.\" I can only say that, having studied\nmy dreams carefully, and, I believe, with an open mind,\nby the association method for the last two years, I am\nunable to find in them any evidence of the working of\nthe Censor. The dreams given below may, no doubt,\nbe interpreted on Freudian lines, (as it is obvious that\nany dream can be), by any one who chooses to follow\nthe all-embracing lines of Freudian symbolism, instead\nof taking my own personal associations with the topics.\nAs the result of following my own associations, which\nseems to me the only reliable method, I have come to\nthe provisional conclusion that there is no deliberate\nconcealment, but rather\u2014where any definite intention\nexists\u2014that the intention is to clear up some train of\nthought,\u2014to express some idea in a form which, when\ngrasped, will give it a fresh significance, and that the\nmetaphors are chosen, as they are chosen in poetry,\nfor this purpose.\nThe views here advanced are based partly on a study\nof some of the work of Freud and Jung, but chiefly\n\f38 Alice Johnson. [part\non analysis of my own dreams, aided by discussions with the\nanalyst (who, of course, is not responsible for anything in\nthe paper). This is obviously a slender basis for generalisation,\nand I should not have ventured to express any opinion on\nthe work of psychoanalysts but that I found myself\ndriven to do so in the course of analysing certain dreams,\nsuch as the \" Queen Victoria \" and \" Kaiser \" cases\nbelow. Whatever point there may be in these analyses\nwould have been lost by the suppression of my personal\nviews. This must be my excuse for writing, as a novice, in\na manner that must, to an expert, appear presumptuous and\ndogmatic. My ojMnions are not put forward as important in\nthemselves, but the interaction between the dream-thoughts\nand the opinions may possibly be instructive.\nTo the psychoanalyst who may find the analyses\nbarren in other respects, I may add that, as remarked\nabove, the personal application of the dream interpretations\nis, for obvious reasons, deliberately omitted.\nGeneral Description of the Process of Analysis.\nThe first stage in the analysis shows the material\nout of which the dream is concocted. We can often\nremember incidents, exjjerienced or read of, which are\nlike the incidents of the dream. We do not remember\nthat we concocted the dream out of them, but we are\nready to believe it, because it accounts for the dream\nin a simple and reasonable way. We can often also\nremember some quite recent circumstance which has\nreminded us of the incidents and has apparently led us\nto work them up into the dream. This affords a reason\nfor the choice of the hicidents.\nBut considering the mass of past experiences from\nwhich we might choose, it would seem that we could\nfind a similar reason for many other choices. And we\noften notice that both the past experience and the recent\nincident are trivial and unimportant ; it is clearly not\nbecause they are especially interesting to us that we\nhave dreamt of them. We have still then to account\nfor the jiarticular selection made.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 39\nIt is the peculiar merit of Freud that he grasped\nthe importance of this question and devised an empirical\nmethod for finding an answer to it.\nThus, I dream that I am walking along a narrow,\nuneven path, cut in the face of a steep hillside, with\nthree members of my family, A., B., and C. After\nwaking I come to the conclusion that the dream was\ncompounded out of memories of two somewhat similar\nwalks,\u2022\n\u2014one with A. and B. in North Wales, the other\nwith C. in the Lakes. I also remember that a day or\ntwo before the dream, I happened to mention the North\nWales walk to D., another member of the family party\nthere, but who did not himself appear in the dream.\nNo particular incident occurred on either of the walks,\nnor was my talk with D. on any but trivial topics.\nThe analytic method takes up the problem at this\npoint, with a view to finding some ground for the choice\nof the dream-material. I look for my associations with\nthe items of the dream : what do I first think of,\n\u2014\ni.e. what is of interest to me,\u2014in connection with the\ndifferent points ? E.g., the Lakes : I think at once of\nMr. Myers, who spent his early life there and had so\nstrong an affection for the country (see his Fragments\nof Prose and Poetry, and his Wordsworth). The thought\nof him naturally carries with it thoughts of his work\nin psychical research ; it carries me at once to one of\nthe strongest interests of my life.\nI give this dream in outline only, including the first\nstep only of the analysis, merely as a preliminary illustra-\ntion of the analytic method. The first step shows that\nthere is more point than appears at first sight in the\nchoice of a walk in the Lakes as one of the factors in\nthe make-up of the dream ; the subject is more interesting\nto the dreamer than was at first apparent.\nFreud holds that by following up the dreamer's associa-\ntions with all the items of the dream, something of\ngreat interest to him may be found connected with\nevery one of them, and that this is why he chose them\nto dream of. He maintains that the ideas which come\nout in the analysis through the dreamer's associations,\n\f40 Alice Johnson. [part\nand which he calls \" the dream-thoughts,\" have entered\ninto\u2014have indeed taken a preponderant part hi\u2014the for-\nmation of the dream, although the dreamer cannot remember\nthat they have had anything to do with it. The links which\nare lost to recollection are supplied by the associations.\nNow it is comparatively easy to believe that in the\ncase just given the dreamer mentally transformed and\ncompounded two concrete images of a walk into one\nsimilar concrete image ; even though no recollection of\nthe mental process could be recovered. We can believe\nit on what may be called circumstantial evidence. It\nis much more difficult to believe that the complex and\nmore or less abstract idea of Mr. Myers and his con-\nnection with the S.P.R. was transformed by some obscure\nprocess 1\ninto the simple concrete image of a walk along\na hillside. It must appear on the face of it much more\nprobable that the idea of Mr. Myers first occurred to\nthe dreamer's mind in the course of the analysis, and\nthat the meaning attached to that idea was read into\nthe dream afterwards. If, as most analysts say, a man\nwill persevere in analysing his own dreams as thoroughly\nas possible for some considerable time, he will probably\nconvince himself that such apparently remote ideas as\nthis have actually entered into the formation of his\ndreams,\n\u2014\ni.e. have not only been read into them after-\nwards ; but\u2014they generally say\u2014his analysis will fail\nto carry conviction to any one else who has not gone\nthrough the same experience. One cannot, however,\nremain satisfied with a conviction which is only j)ersonal ;\nand the cases which I give below\u2014a few typical ones\nout of a large number recorded and studied\u2014are analysed\nin considerable detail, in order to give readers material\nfor forming their own judgment on them.\nA Literary Parallel.\nI referred above to the analogy between dreams and\nliterary compositions,\u2014a feature which has especially\n1 For Freud's conception of the process, which in this brief and bald state-\nment I am not attempting to expound, see his Interpretation of Dreams.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n4.1\nstruck me because it happens that the material for my\nown dreams is largely drawn from literary sources. If\nwe analyse a poetical metaphor on the same lines as\nthose on which a dream is analysed, we find that meanings\nare brought out in a similar way. The analogy is so\nessential for my general argument that I venture to\ngive an instance in illustration, from Dante's Inferno,\nXIV. 103-1 19,\n1\nas follows :\nWithin the mountain [Mount Ida, in Crete] stands erect a\ngreat elder, who holds his shoulders turned towards Damietta,\nand gazes at Rome as his mirror. His head is fashioned of\nfine gold ; and pure silver are his arms and breast ; then is\nhe of brass even to the fork ;\nfrom thence downwards is he\nall choice iron, save that his right foot is baked earth, and\nupon the first more than upon the other he stands upright.\nEvery part beside the gold is burst with a cleft which drips\ntears, the which, collected, pierce this cavern. Their course\ninto this vale is from rock to rock ;\nthey make Acheron,\nStyx and Phlegethon ; afterwards . . . they make Cocytns.\nThe image of this great Old Man is\u2014like so many\ndream-images\u2014compounded primarily of two factors :\n\u2014\n(1) The \"great image\" of Nebuchadnezzar's forgotten\ndream, which Daniel recalled and interpreted to him\n(Daniel II. 31 ff.) :\n\" This image's head was of fine gold,\nhis breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs\nof brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part\nof clay.\" ; (2) the four ages of man, represented by the\nfour metals,\u2014an idea common to the ancients, but perhaps\nderived by Dante from Ovid, Met. I. 89-150, in particular.\nThe Old Man of Crete, then, represents the whole\nhuman race from the earliest age onwards. He is placed\nin Crete because, from Aen. III. 105, Crete is regarded\nas \" the cradle of our race,\" that is, the Trojan race,\nthe ancestors\u2014according to Virgil\u2014of the Romans. The\ntears that issue from every part of him, except his golden\nhead, are shed for the sins and sorrows of the human\nrace. In the golden age alone, under the reign of Saturn,\nking of Crete, [Inf. XIV. 96) mankind was innocent\n1\nA. J. Butler's translation.\n\f42 Alice Johnson. [part\nand happy, for sin and war had not yet come into the\nworld. In the silver, brass, and iron ages men became\nprogressively more and more wicked and impious.\nDante, starting from these two sources, which for\nbrevity may be called Daniel and Ovid, diverges at\nonce from his originals. Daniel's interpretation of his\nimage was that the golden head represented King Nebu-\nchadnezzar, and the silver, brass, and iron the kings\nthat were to succeed him. The symbolism of the four\nmetals here is essentially different from that of the four\nmetals corresponding to the four ages of man ; but there\nis a superficial resemblance between the two cases, and\njust such a superficial resemblance as we often find\nbetween two factors of a dream-image.\nFurther, Dante transforms Daniel's image in two re-\nspects :\n(1) he makes the brass end with the trunk,\nwhereas Daniel's brazen part includes the thighs ; (2) he\nmakes the right foot of clay and the left of iron, whereas\nDaniel makes both feet partly iron and partly clay.\nSuch deviations in the case of dreams rule,\nsignificant ;\nthey are generally indicative of the idiosyn-\ncrasies of the dreamer. In the case of this metaphor\nthey introduce a dominant idea of Dante's,\u2014that the\nhuman race rests essentially on the double organisation\nof Church and Empire, each the supreme human authority\nin its own sphere, both deriving their authority direct\nfrom God. That the Old Man rests more upon his right\nfoot of clay than upon his left foot of iron indicates\nthat the ecclesiastical power had actually become stronger\nthan the secular power,\u2014a usurpation of authority against\nwhich Dante in his works was constantly protesting.\nThe 0vidian factor in the Old Man of Crete is aug-\nmented and largely coloured by what may be described\ngenerally as Virgilian influences, for it must have been\nchiefly from Virgil that Dante drew his enthusiastic\nidealisation of Rome. The Old Man stands in the moun-\ntain with his back turned always to Damietta (in Egypt),\n\u2014the type of the old barbarous and luxurious monarchies\nafter which the degenerate Roman hankered ; from which,\nin Virgil's age, Rome was saved by the Battle of Actium\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\nand the final victory of Augustus over Antony,1 \" nigh\nthe time when all heaven willed to bring the world to\nits own serene mood \" {Par. VI. 55-56). Later Constantine,\nby removing the capital of the Empire to Constantinople,\n\" wheeled back the eagle, counter to the course of heaven\nwhich it had followed in train of \" Aeneas {Par. VI. 1-3), which\nwas the origin\u2014in Dante's view\u2014of the disastrous usurpation\nof temporal power by the Papacy. The reversion to the\nEast symbolises for him a return to the Dark Ages. So\nthe Old Man of Crete keeps his face turned always to\nRome, the ideal city, destined ultimately to become \" that\nRome whereof Christ is a Roman \" {Purg. XXXII. 102).\nThe ancient poets looked back to the past and longed\nfor the return of the primeval Golden Age. For Dante\nthe human race turns its face to the future and looks\nforward to the realisation of its ideals there. Meanwhile\nthe miseries and evils of the past and the present\u2014the\ntears of the Old Man\u2014are flowing continually away\nfrom the earth, down into hell.\nWhile scholars would perhaps not endorse every detail of\nthe above, they would probably all agree that these meanings,\nor something like them, were in Dante's mind as he was\nwriting the passage and have not merely been read into\nit later by commentators. By a somewhat similar process of\nanalysis, one may be convinced that complicated meanings\nare inherent or latent in comparatively simple dreams.\nThe first dream to be considered illustrates the use\nof the association method in disclosing a connection\nbetween the factors that could hardly have been discovered\nby any other means.\nDream. \"The Golden Stairs.\"\nA photograph of Burne-Jones's \" Golden Stairs \" was given\nto me, and I hung it up in a certain place on the wall of\nmy room.\n1 The culminating scene of the future history of Rome represented on\nthe shield of Aeneas, see Aen. VIII. 675 ff. See also the prayer of\nJuno that the Romans may never return to Troy, Aen. XII. 819-828.\n\f44 Alice Johnson. [part\nWhen I woke up, I remembered that the place where\nI dreamt I had hung it was really occupied by two\npictures, Rethel's Der Tod als Freund (Death tolling a\nbell while an old man is dying peacefully in his chair),\nand a Nativity by Diirer. So it seemed that in my\ndream I had substituted the \" Golden Stairs \" for these\ntwo pictures.\nI have never seen the original of the \" Golden Stairs,\"\nor taken any interest in it ; but reproductions of it\n(which do not attract me) are, of course, very common.\nIt happens that, through a casual remark once made\nby a friend of mine, I associate it with Jacob's Ladder,\nthough there is no connection between the subjects of\nthe picture and of Jacob's dream. In the picture a\nnumber of girls are walking down a winding staircase ;\nin the dream the Ladder connects earth and heaven,\nand the angels descend and ascend on it. There is,\nhowever, a connection between Jacob's Ladder and the\ntwo pictures for which the \" Golden Stairs \" was sub-\nstituted ; for in \" Der Tod als Freund \" the soul of the\ndying man is, we may suppose, about to ascend into\nheaven, and the Nativity is a \" descent into generation.\"\nThe Ladder represents both these in a composite form ;\nfor it is associated with the promise of posterity to\nJacob :\n\" The Lord stood above it and said . . . thy seed\nshall be as the dust of the earth . . . and in thee and\nin thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed\n\"\n{Genesis XXVIII. 13, 14).\nThe church at Rottingdean where Burne-Jones is buried\ncontains seven windows designed by him. Of these, the\ntwo in the tower represent Jacob's Ladder and a \" Jesse\ntree \" with the Virgin and Child at the top. I had\nvisited the church and paid special attention to these\nwindows about two years earlier, so that there was in\nmy mind a definite link between Burne-Jones and the\nLadder and the Nativity.\nAnother of my associations with Jacob's Ladder comes\nfrom the Paradiso (XXII. 111-120). Dante rises by the\nLadder from the Seventh Heaven into the Heaven of\nthe Fixed Stars, and finds himself, to his joy, in the\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis .\n4.-,\nregion of his own natal stars, the Gemini. Heaven has\nmany mansions, and he returns to the one from which\nhe first descended to earth, the mansion of his \" genius,\"\n\" the Soul that rises with us, our life's Star.\" He brought\nwith him into the world a certain individuality, and the\nsame individuality he carries back with him into Paradise ;\nit is on this very account that he finds himself at home there.\nThe general idea is probably derived from Plato's\nTimaeus, (known to Dante only in the Latin paraphrase\nof Chalcidius) ; cf. Par. IV. 49-53 :\n\" That which Timaeus\nargueth of the souls. . . . He saith the soul returneth to\nits star, believing it cleft thence when nature gave it\na form.\"\nThe passage alluded to in the Timaeus Myth 1\nis as\nfollows :\nWhen [God] had made of [the elements of the Soul of the\nAll] one mixture, he took and divided Souls therefrom, as\nmany as there are stars, and to each star he assigned a Soul,\nand caused each Soul to go up into her star as into a chariot,\nand showed unto her the nature of the All. [The souls are\nthen born into human bodies, with all the human passions] ;\nand if any man should hold these passions in subjection, his\nlife would be righteous ; but unrighteous if he should be over-\ncome of them ; and whosoever lived virtuously all the time\nappointed unto him should journey back to his kindred star\nand dwell there, and there should have a life blessed and\nconform unto his nature ; but whosoever fell short of this\n[must go through various lower incarnations, until] he should,\nby the might of reason, overcome all that unreasonable,\ntumultuous crowd which was afterwards gathered about him\nfrom the elements of fire and water and air and earth, and\nshould come again unto his first and best estate.\nThis abstract notion of the history and fate of the\nhuman sold Dante characteristically renders into concrete\nindividual terms by imagining himself in the act of going\nthrough the process. His ingenious device of using Jacob's\nLadder for the return journey to the star is, I think,\noriginal\n.\n1\nTranslation in Prof. J. A. Stewart's The Myths of Plato, pp. 275-277.\n\f46 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe dream associations show that the idea behind the\n\" Golden Stairs \" in my dream was Jacob's Ladder, and\nthat Jacob's Ladder stands in the dream for a symbol\nof continuity between the present and a future life, and\nof individual survival.\nThere is another peculiar feature in the dream which\nI did not notice till more than a year after its occurrence,\nviz. the substitution of an English picture, the \" Golden\nStairs,\" for the two German pictures, by Rethel and\nDurer. German is par excellence the language of psycho-\nanalysis (and something German has occurred several\ntimes in my dreams as a symbol or indication of this\nsubject, as will be seen in some cases given below, p. 63) ;\nwhereas English may be called par excellence the language\nof psychical research. The substitution of the English\npicture in the dream is therefore, I think, to be regarded\nas indicating the dreamer's predilection for psychical\nresearch.\nDream. \" The Bacchae.\"\nI came into Botolph Lane, Cambridge, (a narrow lane with\nhouses on one side and the churchyard of St. Botolph's Church\non the other), and saw a cow running wild among a crowd of\nchildren. With some difficulty I got through the crowd and\nwas running away into the street beyond when I heard it\nsaid that some of the children were being attacked by the\ncow. So I turned back, intending to go to their rescue. I\nsaw several small children being tossed up in the air and\nfalling in the churchyard. The most horrible part was that\nthe other children in the crowd were rejoicing in the sight,\nlaughing and shouting exultantly. Before I could get to the\nscene of action, an elderly man, with two or three women,\ncame out of one of the houses. He had a long grey beard,\nand a plain, unattractive face, and carried in his hand some\nsort of antique weapon, like a pike. He went up to the cow,\nwho was now in the churchyard, sitting up and leaning back,\nin the attitude in which one sits in a dentist's chair. He\nsaid to her, \" Madam, you knew it would end in this,\" and\nthen cut her throat. Then he told the parents of the injured\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 47\nchildren, who gathered round him with the children in their\narms, that if the point of his pike was cleaned and placed\nlengthwise against their throats, it would heal them.\nOn waking up from this dream, I said to myself,\n\" Why, that's a parody of the Bacchae,\"\u2014meaning the\nBacchae of Euripides, familiar to me in Prof. Gilbert\nMurray's version. I recognised the Cow as a disguised\nform of Dionysus, the Bull-God,\u2014a disguise which was\nskilfully emphasised in the dream by the Cow being\naddressed as \" Madam,\" but which I saw through at\nonce on awaking. I went over the details of the dream\nin my mind, so that I might remember it in the morning ;\nthen I soon went to sleep again and dreamt again. The\nscene of the first dream (Botolph Lane) was on the way\nfrom my home to Newnham College and was a place\nwhich I must have passed through at least a thousand\ntimes. The second dream was located at Newnham itself,\nand was as follows :\n\u2014\nI was walking through a long passage. One side of the\npassage, where there are in reality a number of small rooms,\nwas transformed into a wall some ten to twelve feet thick,\npierced by three narrow archways. These led out into an open\nspace, surrounded by a high brick wall. The wall was mellow\nin colour, very old, but in perfect repair, and looked very\nsolid. It was almost entirely covered by a creeper, which\nalso covered the whole ground. An extraordinarily soft and\nbrilliant light, like glorified sunlight, was shining down on to\nit, and I noticed particularly the delicate, half-transparent\ngreen of the young shoots and leaves. I recognised the creeper\nas a very common one, perfectly familiar to me, but I could\nnot remember its name. The whole scene suggested peace,\nquiet, and solitude.\nWhen I woke up, it seemed important that I should\nget the name of the creeper. With a considerable effort\nI recalled its appearance to my mind, and then saw that\nit was Ivy. I was vaguely aware that Ivy had some\nsignificance in Greek mythology ; but it took a little\nwhile longer to remember\u2014what was perfectly well known\nto me\u2014that it is one of the commonest emblems of\n\f48 Alice Johnson. [part\nBacchus. Thus the second dream was obviously a con-\ntinuation of the first.\nConsidering that no incident of the first dream is like\nany incident in the play, it seems to me noteworthy\nthat I recognised it at once as a parody of the play.\nThe recognition was not a matter of inference from any\nof the details ; it seemed rather of the nature of an\nimmediate sensory perception ; it was like being in the\nsame room with a person intimately known to one,\nwhose identity it would be imjjossible to doubt, in spite\nof his being dressed in strange and unfamiliar clothing.\nSo I was convinced, and nothing could have shaken my\nconviction, of what the dream Avas.\nThis, I think, amounts to a practical proof that a\ngood deal of subliminal mental activity had gone to the\nconcoction of the dream, and that the recollection of\nthat activity was retained in my subliminal conscious-\nness, while the knowledge of the result of it, and this\nonly, had risen above the threshold of consciousness.\nIn other words, my subliminal self had composed the\njjarody ; it knew that it had done so, and knew, of\ncourse, what it had parodied ; but the only part of its\nknowledge that emerged into the supraliminal was the\nbare fact : Here is a parody of the Bacchae.\nThe material for the dream is borrowed in the first\ninstance from Professor Murray's translation of the Bacchae\nand his Euripides and his Age, and to a less extent from\nMiss J. E. Harrison's Prolegomena to the Study of Greek\nReligion and Dr. Verrall's The Bacchants of Euripides ;\nbut other elements, as will be seen, also enter into it.\nDr. Verrall's view 1\nthat the Bacchae is a veiled attack\non the Dionysiac cult, that the Dionysus of the play\nis an impostor masquerading as the God, and so on,\nmay partly account for the semi-farcical, or superficially\nfarcical, character of the dream.\nIn order to make it comprehensible, it may perhaps\nbe best, for the benefit of readers who are not familiar\nwith the play, to begin with a brief account of it, which\n1 This view is expressly put forward as only one out of several inter-\npretations, all more or less valid ; see op. cit. p. 18.\n\fXXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 49\nI abridge from Professor Murray's Introductory Note to\nhis translation :\nThe myth on which the Bacchae is founded is briefly as\nfollows :\nSemele, daughter of Cadmus, King of Thebes, being loved\nby Zeus, asked him to appear to her once in his full glory ;\nhe came, a blaze of miraculous lightning, in the ecstasy of\nwhich Semele died, giving premature birth to a son. Zeus,\nto save this child's life, and make him truly God as well as\nMan, tore open his own flesh and therein fostered him, till\nin due time, by a miraculous and mysterious Second Birth,\nthe child of Semele came to full life as God.\nHe is a God of Intoxication, of Inspiration, a giver of\nsuperhuman or immortal life. He becomes especially the God\nof the vine. He has many names,\u2014Dionysus, Bacchios,\nZagreus, etc., etc., and also many shapes, especially appearing\nas a Bull and as a Serpent. His worshippers carry the thyrsus,\na wand wreathed with ivy.\nThis originally primitive and barbarous religion was in the\nsixth century B.C. seized upon and transfigured by the great\nwave of religious reform, known under the name of Orphism.\nOrphism was grafted straight upon the Dionysus-worship,\nand, without rationalising, spiritualised and reformed it. Ascetic,\nmystical, ritualistic and emotional, Orphism easily excited both\nenthusiasm and ridicule. It lent itself both to inspired saint-\nliness and to imposture. In doctrine it laid especial stress\nupon sin, and the sacerdotal purification of sin ; on the eternal\nreward due beyond the grave to the pure and the impure,\nthe pure living in an eternal ecstasy, the impure toiling through\nlong ages to wash out their stains. It recast in various ways\nthe myth of Dionysus, and especially the story of his Second\nBirth. All true worshippers become in a mystical sense one\nwith the God ;\nthey are born again and are \" Bacchoi.\"\nDionysus being the God within, the perfectly pure soul is\npossessed by the God wholly and becomes nothing but the\nGod.\nA curious relic of primitive superstition and cruelty remained\nfirmly embedded in Orphism\u2014a doctrine irrational and un-\nintelligible, and for that very reason wrapped in the deepest\nD\n\f50 Alice Johnson. [part\nand most sacred mystery : a belief in the sacrifice of Dionysus\nhimself, and the purification of man by his blood. There was\na constant tradition of inspired Bacchanals in their rites\ntearing to pieces wild animals, even bulls. The wild beast\nthat tore was, of course, the savage God himself. And by\none of those curious confusions of thought, which seem so\ninconceivable to us, but so absolutely natural and obvious\nto primitive man, the beast torn was also the God. The\nOrphic congregations of later times, in their most holy gather-\nings, solemnly partook of the blood of a bull, which was, by\na mystery, the blood of Dionysus-Zagreus himself, the \" Bull\nof God,\" slain in sacrifice for the purification of man.\nIn the play Pentheus, now king of Thebes, son of\nAgave, sister of Semele, denies the divinity of Dionysus\nand suspects that the secret rites of his women worshippers\nare a mere cloak for licentiousness. The suspicion is\nthroughout maintained to be groundless ; and Dionysus,\nto revenge himself on Pentheus, lures him out into the\nforest glades to witness the women's rites, on which no\nman may look, and then leaves him to the vengeance of\nthe women. Inspired by the God with madness, they\ntake Pentheus for a wild beast, and a band of them,\nheaded by his own mother, Agave, tear him to pieces.\nThroughout the Bacchae there is (in Professor Murray's\nwords) \" a sharp antagonism between the two spirits of\nthe Chorus, first, as furious Bacchanals, and secondly\nas exponents of the idealised Bacchic religion of Euri-\npides.\" These two antagonistic aspects of the play are\nrepresented in the two dreams. In the first the crowd\nof children represent the chorus of furious Bacchanals, for\nthe Bacchic possession gives to all, young and old, the\nspirit of exultant, irresponsible youth. It is the extreme\nyouth of the children which prevents their realisation\nof what is going on, so that they rejoice in the excitement\nof seeing the Cow attack their companions ; as Agave\nand her sisters, in their madness and delusion, murdered her\nson Pentheus and exulted in the deed. The second dream\nseems to symbolise the freedom and peace of the initiate,,\none \" who hath fled the tempest and won the haven.\"\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 51\nI propose to examine the first dream in detail, and\nwill begin with its first associations :\n\u2014\nThe children. Their extreme youth, like the madness\nof the Bacchants, made an obstacle to their perception\nof, their communion with the external world. The\nobstacle between us and the babe is like that between\nus and the disembodied :\n\u2014\" Like a child from the womb,\nlike a ghost from the tomb.\" Birth and re-birth.\nThe man reminded me of a typical Dissenting deacon.\nThe worshippers of Dionysus were heretics or dissenters ;\nthe \" inspiration \" of some of the early Quakers and\nAnabaptists was not unlike the Bacchic or Orphic pos-\nsession in a modern form. Dissenters claim freedom of\nthought, and free development of individuality. The man\nseems to represent a Puritan.\nHis Pike : an antique weapon, suggesting the Civil\nWars ; Cromwell ;\nDunbar ;\n\" Peace hath her victories no\nless renowned than War.\" The French word pique,\nmeaning both \" pike \" and \" spade \" (hi cards) ; thus\nsuggestive both of war and peace.\nThe Cow, who attacks the children and is then herself slain,\nis primarily Dionysus in his double capacity of the God and\nthe Victim, \"the slayer and the slain \"\n;\nalthough in the play\nnot Dionysus, but Pentheus, is the victim, and he is slain,\nnot by Dionysus himself, but by his tools, the Bacchants.\nWe may find the first explanation of the change of\nsex in the dream in the fact that a certain confusion of\nsexes is inherent in the myth : (1) Zeus fosters the infant\nDionysus in his own body and brings him to a miraculous\nsecond birth ; (2) Dionysus himself is represented as\nbeardless and like a woman, with effeminate long curls ;\n(3) Pentheus disguises himself as a woman, to spy on\nthe women's secret rites.\nBut more profound reasons are to be found in the\nhighly complex character of the Cow, as revealed by the\nanalysis. The first associations with it were asj follows :\n\u2014\nNursery rhymes, e.g.\n\" Thank you, pretty cow, that made\nPleasant milk to soak my bread.\"\n\f52 Alice Johnson. [part\n\" The friendly cow, all red and white,\nI love with all my heart ;\nShe gives me cream with all her might,\nTo eat with apple-tart.\"\n\" Where are you going to, my pretty maid ?\nI'm going a-milking, Sir, she said.\"\nMilk for babes.\n\" This is the cow with the crumpled horn,\nThat tossed the dog. ...\"\n\" There was an old man who said, '\nHow\nShall I flee from this terrible cow ?\n'\n\"\n\" The cow jumped over the moon.\"\nMythological connection of the crescent moon with\ncow's horns : Io, the cow-maiden.\nEuropa's bull.\nThe Minotaur : Watts 's picture.\nIo, the Argive maiden, was, like Semele, beloved of\nZeus. She was transformed into a cow, and driven in\na state of frenzy over the world by a gad-fly, till she\nfound a resting place in the Nile Delta. There her\nreason was restored and a son was born to her\u2014the\nfounder of a new race. \" To the mythologist Io is pro-\nbably one of the many shapes of the horned Moon, the\nwanderer of the sky. She was identified by the Greeks\nwith the Egyptian Isis, and her son\u2014conceived miracu-\nlously by the touch of the hand of Zeus\u2014with Apis, the\nsacred Egyptian bull.\" 1\nIo, the Cow-maiden, rushing to and fro in her frenzy,\nseems to be one of the factors of the Dream Cow.\nThe slaying of the Cow : its throat is cut. Cf. the\nchorus in which the Bacchants invoke vengeance on the\nblasphemer Pentheus :\n\u2014\nHither for doom and deed !\nHither with lifted sword,\nJustice, Wrath of the Lord,\nCome in our visible need !\n1 Prof. G. Murray, Rise of the Greek Epic, pp. 247-248.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n53\nSmite till the throat shall bleed,\nSmite till the heart shall bleed,\nHim the tyrannous, lawless, godless,\nEchion's earth-born seed !\n(The Chorus-Leader continues :)\nAppear, appear, whatso thy shape or name,\nO Mountain Bull, Snake of the Hundred Heads,\nLion of Burning Flame !\nO God, Beast, Mystery, come !\nAllusion has already been made to the Bacchic or\nOrphic identification of the Victim with the God, whose\nmultiformity is here indicated.\nAnother famous bull-slaying is alluded to in the associa-\ntions : the Minotaur, or Man-Bull, of the Cretan labyrinth,\nslain by Theseus, who cut its throat with the sword\nfurnished to him by Ariadne.\nA further, and perhaps more essential, factor in the\ndream-sacrifice is to be found in the representations of\nMithras, the Persian Sun-god,1\nkilling the Bull, the evil\nprinciple. The God is generally represented as a youth,\nkneeling on a bull, whose throat he is cutting. In another\naspect the Mithraic Bull is the first living creature, and\nits death gives rise to the whole animate creation. So\nvarious creatures, such as a snake, a dog, and a lion or\nscorpion, generally appear in the groups, feeding on its\nvital juices. Thus, either Mithras, by sacrificing the Bull,\nor the Bull, by being sacrificed, is the Creator of the\nuniverse; or rather, both of them fulfil this function.\nHere, again, is the same identification of the God with\nthe Victim as in the Dionysiac doctrines, and the same\ncycle of birth, death, and re-birth.\nIn the Mithraic, as in the Orphic, doctrines, all men\nwere equal in the sight of God ;\n2\nthere was \" neither\nJew nor Greek, neither bond nor free, neither male nor\nfemale.\" All might become initiates,\u2014might, by the due\n1 For the Mithraic religion, see, e.g., Cumont's Mysteries of Mithras.\n2 The religion of Mithras, introduced from Asia into the Roman\nEmpire, became especially (though not exclusively) the religion of the\nRoman army, and an instrument for knitting together the men of the\nmany different tribes and races of which the army was composed.\n\f54 Alice Johnson. [part\nrites, be purified from their sins, and so obtain im-\nmortality.\nThe seating of the Cow, as if in a dentist's chair. The\nseating is perhaps derived from an illustration in Miss\nHarrison's Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion,\np. 483, of a seal-impression, found in Crete, of a supposed\nbnll-god seated on a throne of camp-stool shape. It is\nnot certain that the creature is a bull, but the text\nrefers to similar sealings of a seated Minotaur,\u2014the\nMinotaur being, says Miss Harrison, \" own cousin \" to\nthe Bull-Dionysus of Thrace. Pentheus, according to\nthe genealogy of the play, was literally first cousin to\nDionysus.\nThe dentist's chair. The scene of the dream was close\nto the house of a dentist to whom I used to go in Cam-\nbridge ; and seven days before it occurred I had had\nseveral teeth out in London. But, as remarked above,\nthe recent incidents that are introduced into a dream\nare generally uninteresting in themselves, and selected only\nbecause they can be woven into the fabric of some\ninteresting thing. The inclusion in the Cow associations\n(see above) of Europa's Bull carries us back to the\nlegendary foundation of Thebes. Europa, daughter of\nthe Phoenician king Agenor, was carried off by Zeus in\nthe form of a Bull to Crete, where she became the mother\nof Minos. Her brother Cadmus was sent to look for her\nand enjoined not to return without her. Unable to find\nher, he went at last into Boeotia, where he encountered\na monstrous dragon, the son of Ares (Mars), which he\nkilled. He was commanded by Athena to sow the dragon's\nteeth in the ground ; out of these armed men sprang up,\nwho all killed each other except five. The five survivors\nhelped Cadmus to build the city of Thebes, and became\nthe ancestors of the Thebans. One of them, named\nEchion, married Agave, daughter of Cadmus, and became\nthe father of Pentheus. So the struggle in the play is\nbetween Pentheus, the son of an earth-born warrior, and\nDionysus, the son of a divine father. (See, in the\nChorus from the Bacchae quoted above, \" the tyranno^^s,\nlawless, godless, Echion's earth-born seed.\")\n\fXiXXV.] Dream-Awilysis\n.\n55\nCadmus, the grandfather of both, who acted as a dentist\nto the Dragon, is an important character in the play.\nThe Churchyard, in which the Cow was slain. The\nscenery of the Bacchae is thus described by Professor\nMurray :\n\" The background represents the front of the\nCastle of Pentheus, King of Thebes. At one side is visible\nthe sacred Tomb of Semele.\" The presence of this sacred\nTomb is felt throughout the play. Semele, says Dionysus,\nhas been slandered by her sisters :\u2022\n\u2014\n\" My mother sinned, said they ; and in her need\nWith Cadmus plotting, cloaked her human shame\nWith the dread name of Zeus ; for that the flame\nFrom heaven consumed her, seeing she lied to God.\"\nSo he comes to Thebes\n\" To save my mother's fame, and crown me here\nAs true God, born by Semele to Zeus.\"\nAnd for this purpose he does not shrink from means\nthat have been used by many other religions, down to\nthe historic age of the Inquisition, or even later.\nIn his Euripides and his Age (pp. 181-197) Professor\nMurray gives his view of the relationship of the dramatist\nto this play in words which might be taken almost un-\naltered to describe the psychological relationship of a\ndreamer to his dream. The passage is too long to quote,\nand I will not spoil it by attempting to summarise it.\nBut there is one point in it which probably influenced\nmy dream,\u2014Prof. Murray's comparison of the Bacchae to\na hypothetical play written by some \" great, free-minded,\nmodern poet ... in the style of the old Mysteries, on\nsome legend of a mediaeval saint,\"\u2014a tradition which\nshould fix the incidents to be introduced, while itself\nforming a vehicle through which the poet can express\nhimself all the more freely because the incidents are not\nof his choice or of his invention. The churchyard scenery\nof my dream-drama suggests Miracle-plays, which, being\n\u2014\nlike the Greek tragedies-\u2014a kind of religious ceremonial,\nwere often performed in churches or churchyards. They\nwere, as we know, always crude, often more or less\n\f56 Alice Johnson. [part\nfarcical, and not infrequently degenerated into a coarsely\ngrotesque treatment of the most sacred subjects ; for they\nwere intended to appeal to the common people, and\nperhaps\u2014like the modern theatre\u2014aimed at a lower\npoint than was necessary for that purpose. The dream\nhas a farcical and rather childish element in it, \u2014an\natmosphere comparable to that of a Miracle-play.\nThere is also a specific childish association of mine\nwith this particular churchyard, perhaps worth mentioning\nhere. In the street beyond the church and adjoining it,\nthe inner side of the pavement (by Corpus College) is\nraised some two feet above the rest. This structure was\nknown to us in my nursery days as \" The High Place,\"\nand I vaguely supposed it to be somehow connected\nwith the \" high places \" in the Bible where sacrifices\nwere offered to idols ;\ne.g., to the golden calves set\nup by Jeroboam (I. Kings XII. 28-33). The slaying\nof the Cow in the dream is obviously sacrificial, and\nin spite of the superficial farce, the underlying purpose\nof the sacrifice is certainly serious. We have seen that\nit has elements derived both from Dionysiac and Mithraic\nsources, and that it should take place in the churchyard\npoints to those numerous analogies between the Dionysiac\nor Orphic mysteries and rites and the Christian sacraments\nwhich are indicated in the quotations from Prof. Murray's\nIntroduction to the Bacchae given above. The similar\nanalogies between Mithraic and Christian rites are well\nknown.\nThere is, moreover, a special appropriateness in the\nlocation of the dream considered as a Miracle-play or\nMystery. For miracle-plays were especially connected\nwith the festival of Corpus Christi, and the guild of\nCorpus Christi in Cambridge, which founded Corpus\nChristi College in 1352, is known to have been concerned\nin such plays at about that time. Now St. Botolph's\nChurch and churchyard adjoins the College, and in early\ndays a close connection existed between the College and\nthe church.\nSo far as I am consciously aware, I did not at the\ntime of the dream know of this early connection between\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 57\nthe College and the church ; nor that miracle-plays were\nassociated with the Roman Catholic festival of Corpus\nChristi. I had in my analysis of the dream made the\ncomparison with miracle-plays some time before I came\nacross these facts, which confirm the comparison. But of\ncourse they may have been within my subliminal knowledge.\nThere is another important element in the dream\nhitherto not mentioned. The Dionysian Bull has, it seems,\nbeen transformed into a Cow, and I mentioned above\nthat a certain confusion of sexes was inherent in the\nmyth ; also that Io, the Cow-maiden, seemed to be one\nof the factors of the Cow. But the Cow is slain on, or\nclose to, the equivalent of the Tomb of Semele (i.e. in\nthe churchyard) ; she must then be also Semele. Semele\nhad asked Zeus to appear to her in his full glory, in\norder to prove that he was a divine and not a mortal\nlover ; he came as a blaze of miraculous lightning, in the\necstasy of which she died. So we have in the dream-\nchurchyard the \" Tomb of the Lightning's Bride.\" And\nthe weapon that kills her is the Thunderbolt of Zeus.\nIt follows that the man who wields it is, in one aspect,\nZeus. If this seems at first sight surprising, I would\nrefer once more to the analogy of miracle-plays, in which\nan ordinary citizen might represent the Deity. I would also\nsuggest that the drama of a dream is like private theatricals\nplayed by a limited family party, where \" one man in his\ntime plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.\" Only\nin a dream the parts are played simultaneously instead of\nsuccessively, which makes them difficult to follow.\nThose characters of the Man which belong to his early\nages are revealed by his relationship to the different\ncharacters of the Cow :\nTo Semele and to Io he is Zeus.\nTo Dionysus and to Pentheus he is a Bacchos, an\nInitiate, a sacrificial priest of the Orphic Mysteries.\nTo the Minotaur\u2014the most degraded form of the Bull,\nthe utterly and irretrievably animal form 1\n\u2014he is Theseus.\nTo the Mithraic Bull, he is Mithras ; the initiate who\nis one with the God becomes here the God himself.\n1\nAs represented by Watts ; see associations, above, p. 52.\n\f58 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe Man takes part in a primitive, even revolting,\nceremonial of sacrifice ; but he is also the healer of the\nchildren. He heals them by a sort of magic, of the\nnature of a rite of purification,\u2014and rites of purification\nwere a specially important part of the Orphic cult ; but\nthe actual blood of the slain victim, \" the blood of bulls,\"\nis not used in the rite ; the pike has to be cleansed\nfrom the blood before it can become an instrument of\nhealing. The symbolism of purification by blood in the\nNew, even more than in the Old, Testament and in\nhymns always appeared to my childish mind particularly\nrevolting, while at the same time I imagined it wrong\nto have such feelings. This may have been one cause\nof the cleansing required hi the dream, which, however,\nhas probably a wider significance.\nThe Man in his modern aspect (see associations, above,\np. 51) appears as a Puritan,\u2014presumably an Ironside.\nBut, unattractive as he looks, he retains something of\nhis old character of the Orphic 1\n: for the greatest poet\nof the Puritan age was himself a Puritan.\nThe dream as a whole may be described as a rather\ncrude essay in comparative religion. The main doctrine\nwhich connects together the various religions alluded to-\n\u2014\nthe Dionysiac or Orphic, the Mithraic, and the Christian\n\u2014\nis a belief in immortality. This, being the chief interest\nof the dreamer, is, I think, the predominant underlying\nidea of the dream.\nThe Problem of Personation.\nThe jDsychoanalytic doctrines, both of Freud and of\nJung, assume that the dream is a symbolical summary\nof the psychological state of the dreamer at the moment,\nand that all the dream characters are dramatisations of\nhis characteristics, impulses, moods, or feelings. It is of\ncourse to be understood that the dream-personality does\n1\nOrpheus, the sober ascetic, \"the scrupulous moralist and reformer,\"\nthe \" poet, seer, musician, theologist,\" (as described in Miss Harrison's\nProlegomena, p. 472), reminds one curiously in some respects of Milton.\n\fIXXV.] Dream-Analysis 59\nnot as a rule represent the dreamer in any complete way,\nbut only one aspect of him, or one of his feelings or\nwishes.\nThe same view might be taken of literary compositions ;\nit might be maintained that all the characters of a drama\nrepresent the dramatist himself, or some aspect of him ;\nand there is, no doubt, a certain degree of truth in this\nview. But there is in most cases room for much difference\nof opinion as to how far it is true ; and while dreams\nare probably as a rule more intimately concerned with\nthe dreamer than literature is with the author, the\ndifference appears to me one of degree rather than of\nkind.\nFreud says :\n\" Every dream is absolutely egotistical ;\nin every dream the beloved ego appears, even though it\nmay be in a disguised form. The wishes that are realised\nin dreams are regularly the wishes of this ego ; it is only\na deceptive appearance if interest in another person is\nthought to have caused the dream.\" 1\nDreams may no doubt be interpreted on this basis, just\nas we could interpret every waking thought and action\nas actuated by purely egotistic motives. But I cannot\ndiscover any ground, either in Freud's dreams, as analysed\nin his book, or in my own, for saying that the interest\nin other people displayed in the dream is merely a decep-\ntive appearance. Whatever interest we\u2014whether waking\nor sleeping\u2014take in other people must have an egotistic\nelement in it, and we may, if we choose (as Freud does\nin the case of his own dreams), pick out this element and\ntreat it as the predominant one. But if we do, I think\nwe run the risk of ignoring other and equally true and\nimportant elements ;\njust as to ignore everything but the\negotistic element in literature would give a very one-sided\nview of it.\nI believe, however, that personation plays an important\npart in dreams, and I give next two illustrative cases,\nin both of which two real individuals, myself and the\nanalyst, stand behind the dream-personalities. It is\nnatural that the analyst should often be represented in\n1\nThe Interpretation of Dreams, p. 227.\n\fGO Alice Johnson. [part\ndreams, and such dreams show in a dramatic form the\nrelationship at the moment of the dreamer to the analyst,\nor rather, perhaps, to the process of analysis. I need\nhardly add that the representation of the analyst in such\na dream is not to be taken any more literally than th&\nrepresentation of the dreamer.\nDream. \" Queen Victoria.\"\nMy nephew R. was to have some very slight operation,,\nsomething not much more serious than having a tooth out.\nJust then Queen Victoria came in and hearing that the opera-\ntion was to be performed, asked me to let her know how it\nwent off, which I promised to do. After it was over, I\ndiscussed with my family how to write to the Queen. My\nidea was to begin, \" Madam,\" and go on as one would to\nanybody else. They said that, if I did so, I must write a\ncovering letter, beginning, \" May it please your Majesty,\" and\naltogether formal and ceremonious. R. objected to my sending\nany letter to the Queen ; he cried and clung to me, imploring\nme not to write, as he said it was such a silly fuss to make\nabout nothing. I said I must write, because I had promised\nto do so.\nThe trivial operation of this dream is no doubt the\nprocess of psychoanalysis, which was then being practised\non me ;\nQueen Victoria, the superior and benevolent\nperson who is interested in the result of it, is the analyst\n(a medical woman) ; the other characters represent my\ndifferent feelings about the process. The subject was\nthen new to me ; I found it an effort to give my attention\nto it, and in some moods probably wished to have nothing\nto do with it. This unreasonable side is dramatised as\nthe boy (who appeared in the dream to be much younger\nthan he really was at the time) ; he objects to having\nanything to do with the analyst. The \"family\" do not\ngo so far as this, but they are still dubious ;\nthey will\nonly deal with the analyst in a formal and ceremonious\nmanner, preferring not to come to close quarters with\nher. The \" I \" of the dream plays the most sensible\npart, determining not to shirk the difficulties of the\n\fXXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 61\nsituation, (for I was really much interested in psycho-\nanalysis). One object of the representation of Queen\nVictoria is probably to make it appear difficult ;\nit is,\nfor one unaccustomed to royal society, an excuse for\nfinding it difficult. Yet the idea that Queen Victoria is\nonly a sort of joke is, I fancy, floating about somewhere\nin the background of the dream ; for my first association\nwith the phrase, \" May it please your Majesty,\" was\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. I found on looking\nup the book about two years later that it represented\nmy sentiments much more closely than I had consciously\nrecollected ; the context of the phrase being as follows :\n[The Queen of Hearts asks Alice :]\n\"What's your name, child ?\n\"\n\" My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\" said Alice\nvery politely ; but she added to herself, \" Why, they're only\na pack of cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them.\"\n\"Alice's Adventures\" are dream-adventures, and Alice\nis my name.\nThe address \" Madam \" was associated in my mind\nwith Tennyson, because letters from him to the Queen,\nbeginning \" Madam,\" are published in his Life, which I\nhave read more than once.\nThis dream, then, is associated with two typically\nVictorian writers, Lewis Carroll and Tennyson ; its atmos-\nphere is \u2022\nexclusively domestic ; and\u2014to stamp the whole\n\u2014\nwe have the entry on the scene of the Queen herself.\nAbout six weeks afterwards came another dream, which\nwas only considerably later perceived to be supplementary\nto the one just given, as follows :\n\u2014\nDream. \" The Kaiser.\"\nI was in a room with a number of people, among whom\nwere the Kaiser and Mrs. Salter. Seeing that no one was\ngoing to introduce me to the Kaiser, I bowed to him, and he\nshook hands with me. His manner was polite, but not gracious ;\nhe did not smile. He offered to let me look over a book\nthe Bible) with him. We were standing on a raised dais.\nOn the floor below a man (? King Ferdinand of Bulgaria) was\n\f62 Alice Johnson. [part\nstanding, facing us, and reading aloud out of another copy\nof the same book, like a man reading a Lesson in church.\nThe Kaiser was supervising and prompting him, and frowned\nand gesticulated at him. Ferdinand was confused, had difficulty\nin finding his place to begin with, and lost it hopelessly\ntowards the end.\nMeanwhile I was trying to think of a topic of conversation\nwith the Kaiser, and thought of asking him whether he had\nseen the papers that morning. (The chief topic in the papers\nhad been the refusal of the English fishermen of the King\nStephen to save the German airmen of the wrecked Zeppelin.)\nI forgot at the moment that his sympathies would be on a\ndifferent side from mine.\nAfterwards I saw Mr. Piddington, and remarked to him\nthat it would have been rather funny if I had asked the\nKaiser that question. I also told him that I was disappointed\nnot to see the Kaiser looking more ill (as there had lately\nbeen rumours that he was seriously ill) ; he had been very\npale, but seemed fairly strong.\nIn this dream the Kaiser represents the analyst, while\nthe analysed person is represented by two characters,\n\" I \" and King Ferdinand of Bulgaria. (If this does not\nseem altogether complimentary to the analyst, at least\nit is hardly more so to the dreamer ;\n\u2014the honours are\neven.) The book which the Kaiser and \" I \" were looking\nover together and which Ferdinand was reading aloud is\nevidently the theory of psychoanalysis. Most books on\nthis subject are written in German ;\nhence, probably, the\nintroduction of the Kaiser. The subject has two main\naspects, the therapeutic and the psychological, the\nlatter being the aspect which connects it with psychical\nresearch, and which is therefore the more interesting one\nto me. On the therapeutic or purely psychoanalytic side,\nI am in the position of a pupil of the analyst's, and\nthis seems to be symbolised by the relation of Ferdinand\nto the Kaiser.\nOne of my first associations with Ferdinand was that\nhis action reminded me of the behaviour of Bill the\nLizard at the trial of the Knave of Hearts in Alice's\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n63\nAdventures in Wonderland. Following this line, I thought\nnext of the picture of Bill the Lizard, coming out of the\nchimney, which he had tried to enter from the top,\n\u2014\nthe wrong way for a chimney sweep. This suggests the\nepithet \" chimney-sweeping \" used by Fraulein O. for the\nprocess of psychoanalysis, in a case in Breuer and Freud's\nStudien vher Hysterie, summarised by Myers in Human\nPersonality, Vol. I. p. 55 :\n\" '\nThe talking cure '\nor '\nchimney-\nsweeping,' as Fraulein 0. called it, was practically equi-\nvalent to confession under hypnosis.\" A reminiscence of\nthe same phrase appears in a Holland script as follows :\n\" Is she asleep ? No, she's talking. That chimney\nsmokes.\" Having traced this script phrase to the sentence\nin Human Personality, I have ever since associated the\ntwo together, so that a smoking chimney, or smoking,\nstands in my mind as a symbol of psychoanalysis. 1\nIn regard to the bearing of psychoanalysis on psychical\nresearch, my relation to the analyst is different, since\npsychical research is my special province. Hence the\n\" I \" of the dream, regarded as a psychical researcher,\nstands on a level with the Kaiser. In this subject we\nare opponents, in the sense that our opinions do not\ncoincide, and the disagreement is represented in the dream\nby the different sentiments about the wrecked Zeppelin.\nThe presence in the dream of my colleagues, Mrs. Salter\nand Mr. Piddington, shows that psychical research is an\nimportant\" element in it. They and \" I \" are in the same\nway opposed to the Kaiser,\u2014that is, to the psycho-\nanalyst's view of psychical research,\u2014though we keep up\npolite relations with him.\nThe German element in this dream has a special signifi-\ncance. A transmutation of a German into an English\nsubject has been described above in the Burne-Jones's\n\" Golden Stairs \" dream (p. 46). Somewhat later in the same\nseries, I dreamt that I was back at College, wandering\nabout with nothing particular to do, but planning to study\nGerman. The dream was rambling and incoherent, but\ngave me the impression of dealing in a confused way\nwith psychoanalysis, among other things. On the other\n1\nThe symbol recurs in the dream of \" The Bus,\" given below, p. 92.\n\f64 Alice Johnson. [pabt\nhand, on two occasions, French and Italian\u2014the languages\nof our allies\u2014have appeared in dreams relating to the\nspecial subjects of the automatic scripts, that is, to\npsychical research.\nFurther Analysis.\nOn referring nearly two years later to Alice's Adventures,\nwhich, as a child, I knew almost by heart (and which,\nit may be remembered, has played a great part in political\ncaricatures), I found it accounted for more of the setting\nof the dream than I had realised. This exemplifies the\ngeneral view\u2014frequently confirmed in my experience\n\u2014\nthat the dream-memory is more extensive and more\naccurate than the waking memory. In the picture of\nBill the Lizard alluded to in the associations, I found\nthat there are two chimneys in one stack ; Bill the\nLizard is in the air above one, while clouds of smoke\nare coming out of the other. So it fitted more closely\nthan I was consciously aware of to the Holland script\njohrase, \" That chimney smokes.\"\nI had noted that Ferdinand reminded me of Bill the\nLizard at the trial of the Knave of Hearts (at which\nAlice was an interested spectator and was called upon to\ngive evidence). Bill was one of the jury, who took notes\non slates. He lost his slate-pencil and \" was obliged to\nwrite with one finger for the rest of the day ; and this\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\"\nLater the Queen of Hearts, who sat by the King as Judge,\nand was constantly ordering off persons in the court to\nexecution, threw an inkstand at the Lizard :\n\" The un-\nfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with\none finger, as he found it made no mark ; but he now\nhastily began again, using the ink that was trickling\ndown his face, as long as it lasted.\"\nNow if King Ferdinand is Bill the Lizard, it is evident\nthat the Kaiser is the Queen of Hearts. The picture of\nthe trial shows the Queen of Hearts sitting on the dais\n(with the King), and the jury-box, in which Bill sat, on\nthe floor below, looking not unlike a reading-desk in\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 65\nchurch. So in the drearn the Kaiser stands on a dais,\nand Ferdinand on the floor below is compared to \"a man\nreading a Lesson in church.\"\nThus it appears that the whole dream is a parody of\nthe Trial scene in Alice's Adventures, as the dream of the\nCow, above, was seen to be a parody of the Bacchae ;\nthough in the latter case the parody was perceived by\nthe dreamer immediately after waking, while in the former\nit was not observed till about two years after the dream.\nThe dream Queen Victoria, however, had been, as we\nsaw, associated in the first analysis with the Queen of\nHearts. This makes it still more certain that Queen\nVictoria and the Kaiser are essentially the same person,\nor different aspects of the same person, viz., the analyst.\nThe Queen of Hearts' favourite remark is \" Off with his\nhead I\" Cf. the insistence of the psychoanalyst that the\nemotional factor is the only one that counts in dreams.\nBut as in the Cow dream there are other elements\nbesides those derived from the Bacchae, so in these dreams\nthere are other elements besides those derived from Alice's\nAdventures, and in particular the \" German \" element.\nThe dreamer, it seems, objects in some respects to psycho-\nanalysis, and the objection to it is represented in both\ndreams under the guise of hostility to Germany. In the\nsecond dream the hostility is open ; in the first it is veiled\nby the apparently \"All-British\" atmosphere, and by the\nfact that the word \" Victorian \" stands for something\ntypically English, although Queen Victoria actually was\nof predominantly German descent, and the majority of all\nher family connections were and are German. In the dreams\nthere is much less hostility to her than to the Kaiser,\nbut the hostility is clearly there, although the partially\nGerman dream-person is felt to be less objectionable than\nthe wholly German dream-person. This distinction points\nclearly to the two schools of psychoanalysis,\u2014the purely\nGerman or Vienna school of Freud, and the semi-German\nor Zurich school of Jung. The objection is no doubt to\nthe sexual basis of the theories of both schools.\nThe Freudian position in regard to sex reminds one of\nthose extreme spiritualists who used to put down anything\nE\n\f66 Alice Johnson. [part\nthey could, not understand, such as Maskelyne's con-\njuring tricks, to the agency of spirits. The general\nattitude of this school is indicated in the dream by the\nKaiser being represented with a Bible,-\u2014a book, that is,\nfor which infallibility is claimed. For the Freudian,\nlike the theologian, is apt to regard any disagreement\nwith his views as due to \" resistance,\"-\u2014by which I\nunderstand him to mean resistance to the Truth.\nThe Zurich school, 1\nas is well known, lay much less\nexclusive stress than do the Viennese on the sexual\nelements in the unconscious, as supposed to be revealed\nby psychoanalysis. While holding that the sexual element\nis always to be found, they consider that in many cases\nsymbols which are primarily sexual are not to be inter-\npreted exclusively as such, but, according to the free\nassociations of the dreamer, as standing for many quite\ndifferent ideas and feelings.\nTo me it ajmears that even this school considerably\nexaggerate the supposed sexual symbolism. As, some\nhalf-a-century ago, it used to be maintained by some\nmythologists that religious symbols of all kinds repre-\nsented the sun and pointed to a world-wide primitive\nsun-worship, so it is now held by analysts that any and\nevery object or action, thought of or dreamt of, has,\nprimarily, at least, a sexual significance. In support of\nthis theory, they point to the prevalence of the sexual\nelement in myths, from which they argue that all natural\nphenomena were conceived of by primitive man as sexual.\nOn the other side it may be argued that since, from the\nnarrowness of his experience, primitive man has very\nfew metaphors at his command, it is natural that the\nsexual one should very often occur. But, as a matter\nof fact, the eating and the fighting motifs, the life-and-\n1\nReaders who wish to understand the theories of the Zurich school\nmay be referred to Dr. Jung's Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology\n(Authorised translation, edited by Dr. Constance E. Long, second edition,\n1917). It is impossible to summarise so complicated a subject, and\nquoted extracts are liable to mislead in the absence of their context.\nWhat follows is therefore not put forward as an authoritative state-\nment of Dr. Jung's views, but merely indicates my own provisional\nattitude towards them.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis . 67\ndeath motif, and the parent and offspring motif are also\nvery frequent. It cannot be denied that all these are\nideas at least as primary as the sex idea ; from the point\nof view of biological evolution, they are indeed more\nprimary, for the asexual mode of generation, both in\nplants and animals, long preceded the sexual mode, which\nonly developed slowly, sporadically, and gradually. Why\nthen should all primitive symbols be referred back to sex ?\nJung is of course aware that the theory cannot be\njustified on grounds of biological evolution, and has\nindeed laid stress on this fact in some of his criticisms\nof Freud. But he maintains that innumerable fantasies\nare the desexualised manifestations of originally sexual\ninterests (see his Psychology of the Unconscious, p. 461),\nand that while the position cannot be justified biologi-\ncally, it remains true psychologically {op. cit. p. 459).\nNow from the nature of the case, our knowledge of\npsychological evolution is both more meagre and far\nmore speculative than our knowledge of biological evolu-\ntion. It appears to me, therefore, very doubtful whether\nany conclusions should be founded on supposed facts\nof mental evolution which are, at least apparently, con-\ntradicted by much better established facts of physical\nevolution.\nConfining himself, however, to the mental standpoint,\nJung maintains that sex has more importance mentally\nthan physically, or more in imagination than in reality.\nConsequently it plays a larger part in myths and in\nfantasies than in real life. Consequently every item in\nany myth that has ever been explicitly used as a sexual\nsymbol must be held to have that meaning implicitly\nin all cases where it is not explicit. And in particular,\nany explicit repudiation of the sexual interpretation is\nto be regarded as a \" repression \" and therefore as strong\nevidence of an implicit acceptance of it, \u2014on the principle,\napparently, of \" Heads, I win ;\ntails, you lose.\" Practi-\ncally everything in myths and fantasies having thus been\nshown to be of sexual import, it follows that these prove\nconclusively the ubiquitous and overwhelming importance\nof sex,\u2014which, by the way, was assumed to begin with,\n\f68 Alice Johnson. [part\nas a basis for the whole theory. The argument, in fact,\nis in a circle ; the question is begged to begin with.\nAs an instance of the application of this method of\nreasoning, I may refer to Jung's discussion of the sym-\nbolism of the arrow {Psychology of the Unconscious, pp.\n321-329). He puts together such cases as the sensations\nfelt by the stigmatised nun, Katherine Emmerich ; the\ncomparison of children to arrows in Psalm CXXVII. 4\n;\nthe lance or arrow-head as the symbol of men ; the arrows\nof Cupid ; the arrows of the sun ; the martyrdom of\nSt. Sebastian, etc. Of all the instances given, the arrows\nof Cupid alone are explicitly sexual symbols ; that is,\nthey are the only ones which refer to the relation between\nthe sexes ; for it is obvious that the arrow or lance as\na symbol of men is a weapon borne by men qua fighters,\nnot qua males. To the plain man it would also seem\nobvious that arrows are attributed to Cupid simply because\nhe is thought of, and indeed often spoken of, as a\nvictorious warrior. In other words, the symbolism is\nprimarily derived from fighting, and secondarily sexual,\n\u2014\nnot the other way about. Yet on the basis of all these\ncases in which Jung (following Freud) chooses to treat the\niveapon as a sexual symbol, he maintains that the prevalence\nof the arrow in myths and stories is one among many\nproofs\u2014all based on the same circular method of reasoning\n\u2014that their symbolism is always either sexual, or derived\nfrom sexual bases, modified into something else.\nThe question is not whether this interpretation is\nmorally shocking, but simply whether it is intellectually\njustifiable. It appears to me that it cannot be upheld\non grounds either of science or of logic. On the moral\nside, Jung\u2014and this is where he parts company with\nFreud\u2014regards his theory as providing a basis for the\ncontinued progress of the human race through the proper\ndevelopment and due direction\u2014the \"sublimation\"\u2014 of\nthe sexual instinct. What strikes one in his conception\nis not that he overvalues sex\u2014it would be, perhaps,\nimpossible to do so\u2014but that through deriving so much\nfrom it, he practically undervalues all other elements in\nlife, so that his whole view seems out of proportion.\n\fLXXV.l Dream-Analysis\n.\n69\nIt is this, apparently, which suggested the dream-\nparallel between him and Queen Victoria. The ordinary\nVictorian literature deals with little else but love interests,\nand implies that \u2014especially for women\u2014nothing else in\nlife really matters. Much other literature, of course, did\nand does the same ;\nbut, in England at least, we have\ngradually become conscious of the distortion in the\npoint of view of the typical Victorian, as other elements\nhave been gradually growing in interest,\u2014especially for\nwomen. \" There is one glory of the sun, and another\nglory of the moon, and another glory of the stars : for\none star differeth from another star in glory.\" It is\nwell for the human race to include in its sky the sun,\nthe moon, and all the stars.\nThough some dreams show, on analysis, an extra-\nordinary complexity of meaning, indicating that much\nthought has gone to their make-up, there appear to be\nmany other comparatively simple dreams, of which the\nfollowing is an instance :\nDream. \"The Tableau Vivant.\"\nA friend of mine, Miss S., and I were acting a sort of\ntableau vivant. She was dressed in a bright-coloured semi-\nevening dress, and was supposed to represent a happy wife.\nI was in a sad-coloured dress, with a white counterpane\ndraped over my shoulders, and was supposed to represent\nan unhappy wife. We stood together in the doorway of my\nold home at Cambridge for the people in the street to see us.\nThere were a good man}- people walking about, but no one\nseemed to take any particular notice of us. I said to my\nfriend, rather sadly, \" No one will ever be able to guess\nwhat we are supposed to be.\" She replied cheerfully, \" Oh\nyes, I think they will.\" In order to make it somewhat more\napparent, we went and stood in the next doorway (belonging\nto the same house). Then, to make it plainer still, we walked\na little way up the street. As I walked, the counterpane\nfell off my shoulders on to the pavement. A man picked it\nup, shook it, to shake off the dust, and handed it back to me.\n\f70 Alice Johnson. [part\nI concluded on waking that the dream was intended\nas a skit on psychoanalysis and dream-interpretation ;\nfor the supposition that my friend and I rejjresented a\nhappy and an unhappy wife seemed purely arbitrary.\nThere was nothing to show for it ; we might just as well\nhave stood for any other two women in fiction or in real\nlife. The whole thing was painfully unconvincing ; and\nthis, I thought, will probably be the impression pro-\nduced on the reader by my own cases of dream-analysis.\nIn trying to analyse this dream, the only association\nI could think of was that my counterpane falling off\nme on to the pavement reminded me of Sir Walter\nRaleigh throwing down his cloak so that Queen Elizabeth\nmight pass dry-shod over a muddy path on her way to\nher barge in the Thames. According to the version of\nthis story in Kenilworth, Raleigh declared afterwards\n\" This cloak shall never be brushed while in my posses-\nsion.\"\nFor a long time I tried in vain to think of any other\nassociations. At last it occurred to me that my white\ncounterpane had probably been suggested by the white\nsatin dress of Tilburina and the white linen of her Con-\nfidant in Sheridan's play, The Critic; or, a Tragedy\nRehearsed. The \" tragedy,\" in which Tilburina and her\nConfidant are characters, is called The Spanish Armada,\nand I found, on looking it up, what I had forgotten\n\u2014\nthat among the other characters are Sir Walter Raleigh\nand the Thames. The special point which led to the\nutilisation of this play in a skit on psychoanalysis is\nprobably the famous description of Lord Burleigh's shake\nof the head, by which, \" if [it is explained] he shook\nhis head as I taught him, he gave you to understand\nthat even though they had more justice in their cause,\nand wisdom in their measures\u2014yet, if there was not a\ngreater spirit shown on the part of the people, the\ncountry would at last fall a sacrifice to the hostile\nambition of the Spanish monarchy.\"\nIt seems, then, that there is nothing very subtle or\ncomplicated in this dream. Also, so far as can be judged\nfrom it, when a dream is simple, the associations with\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 71\nit are few and simple. They do, nevertheless, help to\nreveal whatever meaning it may possess,\u2014as, in this\ninstance, by pointing to Sheridan's Critic as the source\nof the scene.\nDream. \"The Two Dolls.\"\nI saw two little dolls, with round flat bodies and round\nflat faces, face to face with each other. The faces had no\nproper features, but little rows of letters across them, which,\nas I could not distinguish the letters, looked like shading,\nintended to represent features. There was very little expression\nin the faces, but as far as it went, it was rather unpleasant,\nhaving a faint suggestion of coarse sneering about it.\nOn the morning before the dream, I had paid a visit\nto my oculist, and had had my eyesight tested in the\nusual way by looking at rows of letters of different\nsizes. The letters on the dolls' faces were like the rows\nof smallest letters, which were indistinguishable to me,\neven with the strongest glasses.\nAt Chicago, several years earlier, I had been given a\nlarge rag doll to take home to a little girl in England,\nnamed Rachel. A friend whom I met that morning at\nthe oculist's had spoken to me of this girl. The Chicago\ndoll was similar in its general shape to my dream-dolls,\nbut a good deal larger. With it was given a sort of\nreplica of itself, consisting of a rag cover just like the\ncover of the first, but without any stuffing and con-\nsequently quite flat. This struck me as an interesting\nvariant on the dolls of my own childhood.\nThe dream-dolls also reminded me of the speech of\nAristophanes, in the Symposium, which purports to de-\nscribe the origin of the human race, as follows :\n1\nThe original human nature was not like the present, but\ndifferent. The sexes were not two, as they are now, but\noriginally three in number ; there was man, woman, and the\nunion of the two. The primeval man was round, his back\n1\nAbridged from Jowett's translation of The Dialogues of Plato, Vol. I,\npp. 559 et seq.\n\f72 Alice Johnson. [part\nand sides forming a circle ; and he had four hands and four\nfeet, one head with two faces, looking opposite ways, set on\na round neck and precisely alike. He could walk upright as\nmen now do, backwards or forwards as he pleased, and he\ncould also roll over and over at a great pace, turning on his\nfour hands and four feet, eight in all, like tumblers going\nover and over with their legs in the air ;\nthis was when he\nwanted to run fast.\nNow the sexes were three, and such as I have described\nthem ; because the sun, moon, and earth are three ; and the\nman was originally the child of the sun, the woman of the\nearth, and the man-woman of the moon, Avhich is made up\nof sun and earth, and they were all round, and moved round\nand round like their parents. Terrible was their might and\nstrength, and the thoughts of their hearts were great, and\nthey made an attack upon the gods.\nAt last Zeus discovered a way to humble their pride and\nimprove their manners. He determined to cut them in two,,\nso that they should walk upright on two legs, and then\ncaused Apollo to turn the face and half the neck round, and\nmould the halves into bodies of the present human form. So\nit came to pass that each of us, when separated, having one\nside only, like a flat fish, is but the indenture of a man,\nand he is always looking for his other half. And when one\nof them meets with his other half, the actual half of himself,\nthe pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship\nand intimac3r\n, and one will not be out of the other's sight\neven for a moment : these are the people who pass their\nwhole lives together, yet they could not explain what they\ndesire of one another. For the intense yearning which each\nof them has towards the other does not appear to be the\ndesire of lover's intercourse, but of something else which the\nsoul of each evidently desires and cannot tell, and of which\nshe has only a dark and doubtful presentiment.\nSuppose Hephaestus, with his instruments, to come to the\npair and to ask them whether their desire was not to be\nmelted into one, so that they might be always together and,\nafter their death, in the world below still be one departed\nsoul instead of two, there is not a man of them who would\nnot acknowledge that this meeting and melting into one\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n73\nanother, this becoming one instead of two, was the very\nexpression of his ancient need. And the reason is that human\nnature Mas originally one, and we were a whole, and the\ndesire and pursuit of the whole is called love.\nMy words include men and women everywhere ; and I\nbelieve that if our loves were perfectly accomplished and each\none returning to his primeval nature had Ins original true love,\nthen our race would be happy. Wherefore we must praise\nthe god Love, who is our greatest benefactor, both leading\nus in this life back to our mm nature, and giving us high\nhopes for the future, for he promises that if we are pious,\nhe will restore us to our original state, and heal us and make\nus happy and blessed.\nMy dream-dolls had letters on their faces for features,,\nand \" letters \" suggest literature, and hence that a\nliterary origin is to be looked for. But they did not\ncorrespond closely in shape with the halves of Aristo-\nphanes' primeval man ; nor did they correspond exactly\nto the two dissimilar Chicago dolls. They represent a\nsort of compromise between the two pairs ; that is, they\nare compounded 'of the elements of both.\nWith the Chicago dolls my first associations were :\nThe name of the dolls' owner, Rachel, suggested to me\na passage in the Purgatorio (XXVII. 100-109) about\nLeah and Rachel. Dante in a dream sees a lady gather-\ning flowers, who tells him : \"I am Leah, and go moving\nmy fair hands around to make me a garland .... but\nRachel my sister ne'er stirs from her mirror, and sitteth\nall day. She is fain to behold her fair eyes, as I to\ndeck me with my hands ;\nher, contemplation ;\nme,\naction, doth satisfy.\"\nThis passage is closely associated in my mind with a\nHolland script (quoted in Proc. Vol. XXVII. p. 110),\nin which it is alluded to as follows :\n\" Do you remember\nthat exquisite sky when the afterglow made the East\nas beautiful and as richly coloured as the West ? Martha\nbecame as Mary and Leah as Rachel.\" Martha and\nMary are the traditional Xew Testament types of the\nactive and the contemplative life\n\u2014\" the good and the\n\f74 Alice Johnson.

In the Convivio (IV. 17 : 85-111) he\nuses Martha and Mary for these types, as in the Commedia\nhe uses Leah and Rachel. The Holland script, in combining\nthem, suggests the Convivio 1\nas well as the Commedia.\nThe Convivio (Banquet) of Dante, in which he cele-\nbrates the praises of his mystical lady, Philosophy, has\na link, at least through its title, with the Symposium,\u2014\nthe speeches in praise of love delivered at the Banquet\nof Agathon (although Dante was certainly not acquainted\nwith the Symposmm),\u2014and this link seems to be im-\nplicit in the dream.\nRachel, face to face with her image in the mirror,\nis like the dream dolls, face to face with each other.\nBut since the image is not of the same nature as the\nobject reflected, Rachel and her image are like the two\ndissimilar Chicago dolls, not like Aristophanes' pair of\nsimilar beings.\nThe script just quoted alludes also to the East and\nWest facing each other, and the colours of the Western\nsunset reflected in the East. A similar opposition of\nEast and West is described in a slightly earlier Holland\nscript (see Proc. Vol. XXVII. p. 107) and forms a cross-\ncorrespondence with a script of Mrs. Verrall's, also alluding\nto a reflection of sunset colours which makes the East\nlike the West (op. cit. pp. 109-112).\nThis second instance of what Mr. Piddington in an\nearlier discussion of the same scripts (Proc. Vol. XXII.\np. 280) called the union or identification of opposites is\nagain, I think, symbolised by the two Chicago dolls,\u2014\n\u2022\npartly because of their dissimilarity, partly because they\nwere brought from the West as a present to the East.\nThe child to whom they were brought also represents\na union of East and West, since one of her parents is\nEnglish and the other American.\nAmong the first of the dream associations with Aristo-\nphanes which I noted was Browning's Aristophanes'\n1\nApology.\n1\nReflection in a mirror is a favourite image of Dante's, and the\nallegory of Rachel (Contemplation) gazing at her fair eyes in the mirror\nis explained in Conv. IV, 2: 143-162.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-A nalysis. 75\nThis is closely associated by me with another Holland\nscript of the same period, containing an allusion to it\n(see Proc. Vol. XXVII. pp. 139-142). The poem includes\na translation of Euripides' Hercules Furens, and the Hol-\nland script forms a Cross-correspondence with two scripts\nof Mrs. Verrall's alluding to the Hercules Furens {cp. ext.\npp. 128-129). The whole of these latter scripts seem to\nbe included in the implicit thoughts of the dream, but\nI will here emote the salient points only :\n{Extracts from Mrs. Verrall's scripts of March 4 and 25, 1907.)\nHercules Furens . . . ask elsewhere for the Bound Hercules\nHjOa\/cA;\/? \\vojuei>o$ [the Unbound Hercules] is the sequel.\nBinding and loosing . . .\nClaviger the bearer of the Key and Club [i.e. the symbols\nof moral and material force] . . .

The immortal things that touch your\nmind in sleep, seize them . . .\nThere and thus does this mortal put on immortality, by\nkeeping hold of the things, the true things, seen in sleep.\nHeracles is supposed to have been an oriental deity,\nimported into Greece from Babylonia ; his club, at least,\nis an oriental element. He is therefore a type of the\nunion of East and West. Analysis of the script shows\nfurther that it contains references to :\n(1) Odyssey, XI.\n601-3, where a distinction is drawn between the shade\n(e'tSooXov) of Heracles 1\nin Hades, and Heracles himself\n1\nIt is perhaps worth noting that there is an association (familiar to\nme) of Heracles with dolls or puppets in Ovid's story (Fasti V. 631)\nthat he was the first to throw dummy figures, made of rushes, instead\nof live human beings, from the Sublician Bridge into the Tiber, as\nsacrifices to the gods. Note also the assonance between doll and idol\n(derived from the Greek eidolon), though there is no etymological con-\nnection between the two words.\n\f76 Alice Johnson. [part\n(qJto?) in Heaven ; (2) the mystical interpretation of\nthese lines in a passage of Plotinus :\n\" The shade of\nHeracles, indeed, may talk of his own valour to the\nshades ; but the true Heracles in the true world will\ndeem all that of little worth ;\nbeing transported into\na more sacred place, and strenuously engaging, even\nabove his strength, in those battles in which the wise\nengage \"\n; (3) Plato's allegory of the prisoners in the\ncave, who are fixed so that they can see the shadows\nonly of real objects outside it ; when released, they\n\" will first see the shadows best, next the reflections\n(e'iSwXa) of men and other objects in the water, and\nthen the objects themselves (avrd).\"\nThe phrase, \" To you they are shadows, but they are\nshadows of the real,\" is not only Platonic, but also\nexpresses the . view of the veridical hallucination held\nby most 8.P.R. investigators, \u2014viz. that the appearance,\naJthough hallucinatory, is not subjectively originated, but\nis the result of telepathy from another mind, whether\nembodied or disembodied. This conception appears to be\none of the ideas behind the crude imagery of the dream.\nThe idea of the contrast between the autos and the\neidolon is rooted in my mind (and therefore likely to\nappear in my dreams) on account of certain references\nto the eidolon in some early Holland script, discussed in\nmy first report on it {Proc. Vol. XXI. pp. 215-218).\nOne passage in this script refers to a supposed occasion\nwhen the surviving spirit saw his still living friends\nas \"flat cardboard figures,\"-\u2014a curiously literal version\nof the imaginary reversal of the point of view of the\nliving.\nThe concej^tion towards which all these ideas\u2014implicit\nin the dream\u2014are converging is, I think, the speech in\nthe Symposium which stands in the sharpest contrast\nto that of Aristophanes\u2014the speech in which Socrates\nhimself sets forth what he has learnt of Love from the\nprophetess Diotima. \" You hear people say,\" says Dio-\ntima {Symp. 205) referring to Aristophanes' myth, \" that\nlovers are seeking for their other half \" ; but she dis-\nclaims this doctrine.\n\fLXXV.j Dream-Analysis. 77\nThrough the mouth of Diotima,1\nPlato insists that it is\nan unfailing sign of true love that its desires are for ever ;\nnay, that love may be even defined as the desire of the\neverlasting possession of the good. And in all love's acts he\nfinds the impress of man's craving for immortality,\u2014for im-\nmortality whose only visible image for us on earth is the\nbirth of children to us as we ourselves decay. \" And then,\"\nsays Plato, rising, as ever, from visible to invisible things,\n\" if active bodies have so strong a yearning that an endless\nseries of lovely images of themselves may constitute, as it\nwere, an earthly immortality for them when they have worn\naway, how greatly must creative souls desire that partnership\nand close communion with other souls as fair as they may\nbring to birth a brood of lofty thoughts, poems, statutes,\ninstitutions, laws,\u2014the fitting progeny of the soul ? . . .\nHe, then, who to this end would strive aright, must begin\nin youth to seek fair forms, and should learn first to love one\nfair form only and therein to engender noble thoughts. [He\nmust then go on to love the beauty of the soul, and the\nbeauty of actions, and of laws and of sciences, till] setting\nsail into the ocean of beauty and creating and beholding\nmany fair and glorious thoughts and images ... he may\nperceive that there is one science only, the science of infinite\nbeauty. For he who hath thus far had intelligence of love,\nand hath beheld all fair things in order and aright,\u2014he draw-\ning near to the end of things lovable shall behold a Being\nmarvellously fair, for whose sake in truth it is that all the\nprevious labours have been undergone . . . And whoso being\nled on and upward by human loves begins to see that Beauty,\nhe is not far, I say, from reaching the end of all . . . What\nwould it be were it granted to any man to see Very Beauty\nclear ; \u2014incorruptible and undefiled, not mingled with colour\nor flesh of man, or with aught that can consume away, but\nsingle and divine ? Could man's life, in that vision and\nbeatitude, be poor or low ? Or deemest thou not (said she)\nthat then alone it will be possible for this man, discerning\nspiritual beauty with those eyes by which it is spiritually\ndiscerned, to beget no shadows of virtue, since that is no\nshadow to which he clings, but virtue in very truth, since\n1\nF.

[part\nhe hath the very Truth in his embrace 1 And begetting and\nrearing Virtue as his child, he must needs become the friend\nof God ; and if there be any man who is immortal, that man\nis he.\"\nSo in the Platonic philosophy, this Divine Beauty or\nWisdom is the reality of which all beautiful objects are\nshadows or reflections.\nIn Human Personality, the passage just quoted follows\nan extract from Prof. Pierre Janet's UAutomatisme\nPsychologique, setting forth \" the physiological or materialist\nconception of the passion of love,\u2014where love's subliminal\nelement is held to be of the organic type,\"\u2014which Myers\ncalls the \" planetary \" conception of love, as contrasted\nwith Plato's \" cosmical \" conception.\nSummary of Analysis.\nTo sum up the analysis of this dream, we have :\n(1) The following pairs of opposites, in which the\nmembers of the pair may be said to be of the same\nvalue or the same nature ; or to be supplementary to\none another, so that, combined, they form a complete\nor perfect whole :\nLeah and Rachel ;\nMartha and Mary ;\nAction and Contemplation ;\nWest and East ;\nKey and Club.\nThese ideas or images in combination are foreshortened\ninto the more superficial stratum of the dream-thoughts,\nand there symbolised by Aristophanes' two halves of the\n\u00a3>rirneval man, who between them constitute the complete\nhuman being.\n(2) The following pairs in which one member of the\npair is only a temporary and evanescent reflection,\nshadow, or image of the other ; and has value only as\nrepresenting it :\nThe Reality and the Shadow of Diotima's discourse,\nPlato's Cave, etc.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Atmlysis. 70\nThe Autos and the Eidolon of Heracles, etc.\nThe Western sunset reflected in the Eastern sky.\nRachel and her Image in the Mirror.\nThese pairs are represented or summed up in the\nsuperficial stratum of the dream-thoughts by the Chicago\ndoll and its flat replica.\nThere are points of connection between the two lands\nof pairs, corresponding to the fusion of the two types\ninto the one pair of dream-dolls. Thus Rachel comes\ninto both ; as do East and West ; also Heracles, as\nClub-bearer in the first set, and as autos and eidolon in\nthe second.\nIn other words, there is not in the dream a perfectly\nclear-cut conception of the two types ; no absolute line\nis drawn between them. The dream leans, it would\nseem, to Myers's conception of the \" planetary \" and\n\" cosmical \" aspects rather than to the extreme mystical\nstandpoint.\nThe analysis just given represents the view arrived at\nafter several attempts, made at intervals, to interpret\nthe dream on the basis of my associations. On so\ncomplicated a dream (as it turned out to be) fresh lights\nare often thrown by repeated analyses, each of which\ngenerally reveals points that had not been noticed before.\nIt is instructive for the dreamer to keep records of all\nhis analyses, but it would generally be tedious for the\nreader to have them all reproduced. Sometimes, how-\never, the final interpretation can hardly be appreciated\nwithout a knowledge of the stages through which it has\nbeen reached, and this seems to me the case with the\nnext dream, which was as follows :\nDream. \" The Fabulous Horse.\"\nI was going on an excursion with two or three other people.\nWe were only going up and down a broad path, some fifty\nyards or less in length. I had to ride on a horse, which I\nwas rather afraid of, having never been on horseback before ;\nbut I found it quite easy to manage. I had to make a\nbackward and forward movement with my leg or arm, and\n\f80 Alice Johnson. [part\nthen the horse went on, as if it were a mechanical thing.\nIt only required a little steering besides, as it had a tendency\nto run into the right side of the path. Its legs were like\nstraight wooden sticks.\nFirst Analysis.\nThe first association of this dream was with an Austrian\nfriend of mine (now dead), Miss Freund, who had spent\nher early life in Vienna (this, of course, points to Dr.\nFreud, of Vienna). As she became lame in later life,\nshe used to ride a hand-propelled tricycle, worked by a\nbackward and forward movement of the handles, like my\nbackward and forward movement on the horse. A\ntricycle naturally requires steering also. I once tried to\nride one after being accustomed to a bicycle, and found\nit very difficult to prevent its running into the side of\nthe road.\nI associated the straight wooden-like legs of the dream-\nhorse with a child's story-book, called Beechnut, in which\nthe hero, Beechnut, makes a rocking-horse out of a log\nof wood, into which three pairs of long straight poles\n(cf. the three wheels of the tricycle) are fixed, to serve\nas legs. The horse had no rockers, but the middle pair\nof legs was longer than the front and back pairs, so\nthat it could be rocked backwards and forwards. It\nwas a remarkably imnatural kind of horse : not a real\nhorse, but a rocking-horse ; and not even a real rocking-\nhorse, for it had no rockers, and its legs were straight,\nand six in number instead of four.\nTo have six legs is a characteristic of insects (a fact\nthat could not fail to occur to the mind of any person\nwith a knowledge, however slight, of Zoology). Insects\nare a much lower class of animals than horses. To\nmy mind many insects are repulsive ;\nthey are associ-\nated with dirt and the production of diseases. On the\nother hand, metaphors of an imaginative or mystical\nkind have been associated with them : they are treated\nas symbols of development, or of the soul. E.g., the\ndevelopment of the caterpillar into the butterfly (i.e. the\n\fIjXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 81\nasexual into the sexual form) is regarded as symbolic\nof death and resurrection, or the death of the body and\nthe immortality of the soul. Or the bee\u2014the honey-\nmaker\u2014is a symbol of the soul (see Virgil, Georg. IV.\n220 ff.). Honey the food of the infant god.\nThe bee commonwealth :\n\" Obedience\u2014for so work the honey bees. . . . The\nsinging masons, building roofs of gold.\"\n1\nSamson ; the swarm of bees and honey found in the\ncarcase of the lion he had killed,\u2014the occasion for his\nriddle (Judges XIV. 8, 14).\nJohn the Baptist, who fed on locusts and wild honey\n(Matthew III. 4),\u2014another insect association.\nDrones :\n\" Was I a drone ? At least there was honey\nwithin my reach, even if I brought none to the hive.\"\nThis is a quotation from a Holland script (see Proc,\nVol. XXI. p. 322). The word \" drone \" had been\nobserved later to be an anagram for \" Roden,\" viz.\nRoden Noel, to whom this and several other scripts\nreferred. In later scripts R. Noel's name is associated\nwith Christmas and Christmas carols.\nMy first attempt to interpret the dream on the basis\nof these associations gave the following results :\nThe dream-horse, which is a composite of a tricycle\nand a very unrealistic artificial horse with a definite\nbias in a certain direction, represents Freud's theory\nof psychoanalysis, which I was endeavouring to master.\nThe theory appears to me in many respects highly\nartificial, and strongly biassed by the idiosyncrasies of\nits author.\nThe connection of the horse with the insect type brings\nin a sex association which seems to include both ex-\ntremes of the possible functioning of sex,\u2014as an instru-\nment either of the lowest degradation or of the greatest\nelevation of mankind.\nIt appeared to me, however, that the dream-imagery\ncovered a good deal more than this interpretation, and\nthat there was some clue in it which I had not yet\nfound. I therefore put it aside for a time, on the chance\n1\nHenry V., Act I., Scene 2 : speech of the Archbishop of Canterbury.\nF\n\f82 Alice Johnson. [part\nthat a fresh light might be thrown on it from some\nother quarter.\nMeanwhile I looked, up the story-book, Beechnut, and\nfound that my recollection of the rocking-horse was\ninaccurate. There was a doubt as to whether it should\nhave six or eight legs ;\nthe scholar of the family was\nasked to suggest a name for the animal, and he said\nthat it should be called Hexapod if it had six legs, or\nPolypod if it had more than six. Ultimately the horse\nwas christened Polypod, from which one may infer\n(though this is nowhere stated) that it had eight legs.\nIt must be supposed that my subliminal memory in-\ncluded this point, in which case the conception of the\ndream-horse was a composite, including a six-legged\ncreature {i.e. the Insect type) and an eight-legged creature,\nto which the nearest parallel in nature would perhaps\nbe the Arachnida (spiders and scorpions, etc.).\nSecond Analysis.\nThe dream took place three nights later than the\ndream of the \" Two Dolls.\" On the day after that\ndream, I had made a preliminary analysis of it, recog-\nnising the Chicago dolls and Aristophanes' pair of beings\nas the factors of the comjjosite dream-dolls. But I was\nnot very familiar with the Symposium, and my conscious\nrecollection of Aristophanes' speech was so vague that I\nnoted it merely as \" myth of creation of sexes by\n? Aristophanes in Symposium.\" On this topic, again, it\nseems certain that my subliminal memory was far more\nextensive and accurate ; for when, about four months\nlater, I got the book again and read it carefully with a\nview to working out the analysis of the \" Two Dolls\n\"\ndream, I found, to my surprise, that Aristophanes'\nprimeval man was behind the Dream-horse also. For the\nprimeval man (see p. 71), like Beechnut's rocking-horse,\nhad eight limbs, and the way the horse rocked back-\nwards and forwards on its eight legs was like the way\nthe man rolled over and over, backwards or forwards,\non his eight limbs.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n83\nWe have seen that the rocking-horse was in the first\nanalysis closely associated with the idea of insects.\nAnother childish association following (in the second\nanalysis) from the zoological train of thought was the\npicture of the \" Rocking-horse-fly \" in Through the\nLooking-glass}\nThe Rocking-horse-fly has four legs and two large\ngauzy wings ; it is introduced by the following con-\nversation :\n\" What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where you come\nfrom ?\n\" the Gnat inquired.\n\" I don't rejoice in insects at all,\" Alice explained, \" because\nI'm rather afraid of them\u2014at least the large kinds. But I\ncan tell you the names of some of them . . . [For instance,]\nthere's the Horse-fly.\"\n\" All right,\" said the Gnat :\n\" half way up that bush you'll\nsee a Rocking-horse-fly, if you look. It's made entirely of\nwood, and gets about by swinging itself from branch to\nbranch.\"\nHere, then, are combined the ideas of the Horse, Fly,\nand Rocking-horse (certainly not a usual combination)\nwhich we find combined in the dream ; while the\nLooking-glass is, as we have seen, an essential consti-\ntuent of the dream of the \" Two Dolls,\" which is so\nclosely connected with this one.\nIn the first analysis, the associations with Bees are\nespecially numerous and prominent. One of the most\nfamiliar facts about bees is their three different forms,\n\u2014\nthe Queen-bee (the female), the workers (imperfectly\ndeveloped sterile females), and the drones (males). These\nthree forms are all alluded to in the dream-associations\n(see above) through the quotations from the Holland\nscript and from Henry V., for the \" obedience \" preached\nby the Archbishop is compared to the supposed obedience\nof the bees to their \" king \" or \" emperor.\"\nIn the Fourth Georgia (an important factor in the\ndream-associations), Virgil gives a picturesque description\n1\nCf. allusions to Alice s Adventures in Wonderland in the \" Queen\nVictoria\" and \"Kaiser\" dreams above, pp. 61, 62, 64-65.\n\f84 Alice Johnson. [part\nof the labours of the different kinds of bees and their\ndevotion to their \" king \" and to \" the tiny citizens of\ntheir Rome \" (Georg. IV. 201) ; but naturally he has\nno idea that the varieties of form have any relation to\nsexual structure. 1\nShakespeare is at just the same stand-\npoint.\nIt seems to me that the idea of a certain analogy\nbetween the three forms of bees and Aristophanes' three\nsexes had occurred to my subliminal mind. The\nanalogy is, of course, superficial, since Aristophanes'\nthird sex was hermaphrodite (a characteristic which is\nnormal in many classes of the Invertebrata, but not,\nI think, in any class of Insects), while the third bee form\nis actually female. There is nevertheless a superficial\nresemblance between the two cases, and just such a\nresemblance as seems calculated to strike the dreaming\nmind.\nFurther, I feel little doubt that Aristophanes' three\nsexual forms, which \" were all round, and moved round\nand round like their parents,\" (see above), provided a\nfactor for the three wheels of my dream-tricycle.\nBut another factor of the Tricycle-Rocking-horse-Insect\nidea is, I believe, derived from the famous allegory in\nthe Phaedrus, in which the Soul (whether of a man or\na god) is described \"in a figure \" as a composite\nnature, made up of a charioteer and a pair of winged\nhorses. Here the Soul is driving a wheeled vehicle, which\nis probably one of the elements going to make up my\nTricycle. The chariot of the Soul is presumably, like\nthe ordinary form of the Greek chariot, two-wheeled ;\nbut the Soul itself has three constituents,\u2014another\ntrinity contributing to the make-up of my Tricycle, which,\nlike the Soul, requires to be steered (see Dream).\nThe Soul's pair of horses have, between them, eight\nlegs,-\u2014another parallel to the eight legs of my Rocking-\nhorse ; and these horses are winged, like the \" Rocking-\nhorse-fly.\" It is perhaps worth noting that the wings\nof fabulous animals of this kind, if they can be compared\n1\nThe facte about this were first shown by the discoveries of Francois\nHuber, about 1787-1790.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n8f>\nwith anything in nature, are like the wings of insects,\n\u2014\nnot like the wings of birds, which are a modification of\nthe Vertebrate fore-limbs.\nThe following circumstances add to the probability\nthat the Symposium and the Phaedrus were important\nfactors in the formation of this dream :\n(1) The Dream that occurred three nights earlier had\nalready been interpreted as derived from the Symposium.\n(2) Either just before or just after this first dream,\nI had been discussing with a friend certain points in\nthe Symposium and the Dialogue most closely associated\nwith it, \u2014the Phaedrus (with which I had long been\nfamiliar), so that these two Dialogues had been much\nin my mind.\n(3) I had also been considering the facts of the evolu-\ntion of sex in the lower animals, with a view to their\npossible bearing on the theories of Freud and Jung.\nThis probably accounts for the zoological atmosphere of\none aspect of the dream.\nThe significance of the Phaedrus elements in the dream\nmust be further considered.\nIn the Phaedrus allegory,\n1\nthe horses of the gods are both\nnoble and of noble descent, but those of the man are one\nnoble and of noble breed, and the other ignoble and of ignoble\nbreed, and the driving 6f them of necessity gives a great\ndeal of trouble to him. The ignoble, ugly, left-hand horse\nis always struggling, against the will of the charioteer, to\ndrag the chariot down to earth ; while the noble and beautiful\nright-hand horse strives always to keep it in the upper world,\n\u2014\nthe plain of truth, where pasturage is found which is suited\nto the highest part of the soul. There abides the very being\nwith which true knowledge is concerned, and there the intelli-\ngence of every soul which is capable of receiving the food\nproper to it rejoices at beholding reality. [The myth is\nconnected with the doctrine of the transmigration of souls,\nthe incarnations being separated by periods of a thousand\nyears each, after which the souls draw lots and choose their\nnext lives.] The soul of a man may pass into the life of a\n1\n1 give here parts of Jowett's translation, in an abridged form.\n\f86 Alice Johnson. [part\nbeast, or from the beast return again into the man. But the\nsoul which has never seen the truth will not pass into the\nhuman form. For a man must have intelligence of universals,\nand be able to proceed from the many particulars of sense\nto one conception of reason ; \u2014this is the recollection of those\nthings which our soul once saw while following God\u2014when,\nregardless of that which we now call being, she raised her\nhead up towards the true being. And therefore the mind of\nthe philosopher alone has wings ; and this is just, for he is\nalways, according to the measure of his abilities, clinging in\nrecollection to those things in which God abides, and in\nbeholding which He is what He is. And he who employs\naright these memories is ever being initiated into perfect\nmysteries, and alone becomes truly perfect.\nIn these two closely associated Dialogues may be\nfound Plato's concejDtion of immortality,-\u2014the subject\nwith which, I take it, the dream is fundamentally con-\ncerned.\nThe Phaedrus contains the Platonic doctrine of reminis-\ncence,-\u2014that whatever vision of the real we may have\nin this life is \" the recollection of those things which\nour soul once saw while following God,\"\u2014and the doctrine\nof successive re-incarnations, each of which is a state\nof probation, finally ending in a permanent release from\n\" that living tomb which we carry about, now that we\nare imprisoned in the body.\"\nBut (says Jowett 1\n) while the Phaedrus looks backwards\nand forwards to past and future states of existence, in the\nSymposium there is no break between this world and another ;\nand we rise from one to the other by a regular series of\nsteps or stages ... At first immortality means only the suc-\ncession of existences [i.e., of generations ; see quotation from\nthe discourse of Diotima given in the analysis of the \" Two\nDolls \" dream, p. 77] ; even knowledge comes and goes.\nThen follows, in the language of the mysteries, a higher and\na higher degree of initiation ; at last we arrive at the perfect\nvision of beauty . . . eternal and absolute ; not bounded by\nthis world, or in or out of this world, but an aspect of the\n1\nIntroduction to the Symposium.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 87\ndivine, extending over all things and having no limit of space\nor time . . . Plato does not go on to ask whether the individual\nis absorbed in the sea of light and beauty or retains his\npersonality. Enough for him to have attained the true beauty\nor good, without enquiring precisely into the relation in which\nhuman beings stood to it.\nIt is this conception of immortality, or the gradual\nevolution of the conception of immortality, that links\nthe Platonic elements of the dream with the element\nderived from the Fourth Georgic,\u2014the Bee as a symbol of\nthe Soul (see first analysis, above, p. 81). The story of\nSamson finding the swarm of bees in the lion's carcase\nclosely resembles the story of Aristaeus, who, after all\nhis bees had been killed by disease, found fresh swarms\nin the bodies of the sacrificed oxen (Georg. IV. 550 ff.).\nThe bee\n1\nis a creature of special sanctity among the ancients\nand has special associations with birth, death, and re-incarna-\ntion . . . Re-incarnation could hardly be more clearly suggested\nthan by the story in the Fourth Georgic of the miraculous\nbirth of bee-life from the dead body of a bull, after due\npropitiation by Lethean poppies has been made to Orpheus.\nEarlier in the same poem (206-208) we are reminded that,\nthough the individual bees perish, the race remains immortal.\nMost significant of all is .the suggested explanation of the\nspecial virtue of the bee in the view of '\ncertain persons\n'\n(219-227) that the bees partake of ethereal draughts, this\nsame ethereal element being described in the great speech of\nAnchises as the only part left to the soul after its complete\npurgation {Am. VI. 747). It is clear, therefore, that the bee\nin Virgil's mind was closely associated with the idea of the\nre-incarnation of the purified soul, and the comparison of the\nsouls gathering round Lethe to hovering bees gains suggestive-\nness from this fact.\nTo continue the dream-associations revealed in the\nfirst analysis :\nFor \" honey the food of the infant god,\" see Georg.

So the god, rescued\nfrom all-devouring Time, became an Immortal.\nThe dream-associations show also an allusion to Christ-\nmas and the Child associated with the prophecy of\nIsaiah (VII. 15), \" Butter and honey shall he eat.\"\nAs to Mount Ida, the Christian name of Miss Freund,\nthe lady who rode the tricycle, was Ida. As mentioned\nabove, I had in the first analysis of the dream noticed\nthe similarity of the names \" Freund \" and \" Freud.\"\nBut, though I was perfectly familiar with the story of\nthe infant Zeus being fed with honey on Mount Ida,\nand with the fact that Miss Freund's name was Ida, it\nwas several months before I consciously put these two\nthings together, and observed that they must have been\nconnected in my subliminal. I think it is a fair conclu-\nsion that the other famous Mount Ida (in Asia Minor,\nnear Troy, referred to in Georg. IV. 41, as the Phrygiati\nIda), celebrated as the scene of the rape of Ganymede,\nmust also have been in the dream-thoughts.\nIn the later Roman tombs and monuments 1\nGanymede\nborne up to heaven by the eagle is supposed to be a\nsymbol of the soul liberated from earth. The analogy\nwith the Phaedrus Soul carried up to heaven by its\nwinged horses is obvious. There is also at this point\na link with the \" Golden Stairs \" dream and the picture\nDer Tod als Freund associated with it (see above, p. 44).\nI had not noticed this link till the analyst, reading my\naccount, observed the coincidence of the name Freund\nbeing implicit in both dreams, the interval between which\nwas about nineteen months.\nIn Purg. IX. 19-30, Dante dreams that he is on Mount\nIda and is carried up to heaven, like Ganymede, by an\neagle. On waking, he finds that he has, in his sleep,\nbeen carried up the lowest part of the Mount and placed\njust below the Gate of Purgatory. The Eagle, says\nA. J.

These\nDante associations, then, form another link between\nthat dream and the present one, affording further evidence\nof the continuity of thought between them.\nFurther, the Platonic and Virgilian doctrines of immor-\ntality bound up with a Purgatorial scheme, which we\nfound included in the dream-thoughts, can hardly have\nfailed to suggest Dante's treatment of the same topic.\nThe chief feature which distinguishes Dante's scheme\nfrom earlier ones is the emphasis laid on the individual\nelement,\u2014on the persistence of individuality, of person-\nality. It has been remarked (by, I think, Dean Church)\nthat all the characters in the Commedia (apart from\nmythological monsters and heroes of antiquity in whose\nactual historical existence Dante may have believed)\nare real persons, either historical or his own contem-\nporaries ; \u2014they are not types, although they may be\ntaken incidentally to typify virtues or vices. Dante,\n\" who loved well because he hated,\" had a vivid realisa-\ntion of individuals, and an intense interest in their\nindividual fates.\nIn accordance with this modern sense of the value\nof the human being, as such, is the disappearance of the\ndoctrine of the transmigration of souls ; for it is difficult,\nthough not, of course, theoretically impossible, to reconcile\na number of successive incarnations, involving a number\nof successive forgettings, with the persistence of the\nindividual, whose characteristics must be so intimately\nbound up with his memories. No doubt the doctrine\nis absent from Dante because it is not a Christian\ndoctrine 1\n; but its absence is in complete harmony with\nhis whole tone of mind.\n1\nSee, however, the legend of Trajan, whose soul, by a special miracle,\nwas delivered from Hell and re-incarnated (Par. XX. 43-117).\n\f90 Alice Johnson. [part\nSummary.\nTo sum up the factors of this dream :\nThe Dream-horse is composed of (a) The Rocking-horse,\nand (b) The Tricycle.\n(a) The Rocking-horse comprises :\n(1) Hexapod = Insect ; \u2014Butterfly, Bee.\nThe Bee has three forms ; cf. Aristophanes' three sexes.\nThe Bee symbolises the Soul.\n(2) Polypod = Aristophanes' eight-limbed man, and the\nPhaedrus Soul's two four-legged horses.\nHexapod and Polypod combined = The \" Rocking-horse-\nfly,'' and the Phaedrus Soul's winged horses.\n(b) The Tricycle comprises :\nSeveral trinities, viz. :\n(1) Three pairs of Hexapod legs ; and\n(2) Three forms of Bees ; and\n(3) Aristophanes' three sexes, who moved round and\nround ; and\n(4) The three elements of the Phaedrus Soul, viz. the\nCharioteer and two horses.\n(5) The Chariot of the Soul, as a wheeled vehicle.\n(6) Ida, the name of the owner of the Tricycle,\nsuggesting Mount Ida, with which are associated :\n(7) The Infant God fed by the Bees ; and\n(8) Ganymede carried up to heaven by the Eagle, as the\nPhaedrus Soul is carried up by its winged horses ; and\n(9) Dante carried up to the Gate of Purgatory by his\nDream-Eagle.\nAristophanes' myth refers to the constitution of the\nbod}^, the Phaedrus myth to that of the soul. So the\nintimate association of elements derived from both in the\nDream-Horse must symbolise the connection between the\nbody and the soul.\nOn the other hand the antithesis between Body and\nSoul is no doubt conceived of in the dream as analogous\nto the antithesis in the \" Two Dolls \" dream between\nthe Shadow and the Reality, or the Eidolon and the\nAutos, or the Planetary and the Cosmical (see pp. 78-79).\n\fLXXV.] Drea ra-A nalysis\n.\n01\nSupplement to the Analysis of the \" Two Dolls \" dream.\nIt happens not infrequently that the analysis of one dream\nthrows light on a preceding one. Thus, after discovering\nin the \" Fabulous Horse \" the Rocking-horse-fly element,\nderived from Through the Looking-glass, I noticed that\nthis fitted in with the Mirror or Looking-glass element\nin the \" Two Dolls.\" It then became apparent that\nanother element in the same book must have contributed\nto the \" Two Dolls,\" viz. Tweedledum and Tweedledee.\nThey, it may be remembered, show Alice the Red\nKing lying asleep in the forest, and tell her that he is\ndreaming of her ; and they add, to her great indigna-\ntion, that she is only \" a thing in his dream,\" and that\nif he were to wake, she would \" go out like a candle \"\n;\nthe \" real \" situation of course being that Alice is the\ndreamer, and the Red King a \" thing \" in her dream.\nThe idea is one calculated to appeal equally to the\nPhilosopher in the Child and the Child in the Philosopher.\nTweedledum and Tweedledee are also interesting,\nbecause one can never feel sure whether they are the\nsame person or not. Are they one or two ? Or are they,\nperhaps, alternating personalities ? In that case, which\nof them is the \" real \" person ? Or are they of what\nis called the \" co-conscious \" type ?\nAll these problems- connected with Tweedledum and\nTweedledee, as well as the metaphysical theory they\npropound to Alice, fit in closely with the whole of the\ndream conception,\u2014the question, What is \" the real \" ?\nWhile the two dreams just given are examples of\ncomplicated abstract ideas combined and compressed into\nsimple images or metaphors, the next one returns to\nwhat was called above \" the j^oblem of personation.\"\nIt contains a dream-character who turns out on analysis\nto be a composite of several persons. It also illustrates\nthe occurrence in dreams of puns and other plays on\nwords, which Freud considers an important factor in\ndream formation. These, however, belong not to the\n\" manifest,\" but to the \" latent \" content of the dream\n\f92 Alice Johnson. [part\n(as in other cases in my exjDerience, e.g., \"Mount Ida\"\nabove), and so are revealed only through the analysis.\nDream. \"The Bus.\"\nI was in a bus. There was a young woman there ;\nalso,\nI think, a woman conductor. I turned to one side and saw\nthat a man, whom I had not noticed before, was sitting by\nme, smoking a pipe. A few of the ashes fell on my dress.\nI shook them off, and said to the man, \" Excuse me, but\nsmoking is not allowed inside the bus.\" He glared at me,\nbut said nothing. I felt a little nervous, but determined to\ncall to the driver if he did not leave off smoking. I intended\nto do this by pulling a string, as one might in a train to call\nthe guard. The man was wearing a soft slouch hat with a\nwide brim that partly hid the upper part of his face. He\nlooked like a sailor, or some one who had wandered about the\nworld a good deal. The strangest part of him was his eyes, which\nwere extraordinarily bright and glittering. He half closed them\nwhen he glared at me, which emphasised the effect of glittering.\nMy first associations with this dream were : Gaboriau's\nMonsieur Lecoq, which I was then in the middle of\nreading. As I am interested in detective stories, and\nfamiliar with the Sherlock Holmes series, it had natur-\nally occurred to me to compare the French detective,\nLecoq, with the English, Sherlock Holmes, who smokes\nto excess. The glittering eyes of the man in the bus\nalso suggested to me almost at once the \" Ancient\nMariner.\" I therefore regarded him primarily as a com-\nposite of Sherlock Holmes and the Ancient Mariner.\nThe Ancient Mariner was intended by Coleridge as a\nstory of the supernatural, not as a study in psychology.\nBut, as he himself pointed out.\n1\nthe emotional state\n1\nIt was planned as one of a series of poems, in which \" the incidents\nand agents were to be, in part at least, supernatural ; and the excellence\naimed at was to consist in the interesting of the affections by the\ndramatic truth of such emotions, as would naturally accompany such\nsituations, supposing them real. And real in this sense they have been\nto every human being who, from whatever source of delusion, has at\nany time believed himself under supernatural agency \" (Biographia\nLiteraria. chap. XIV.).\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 93\nof the hero is obviously like that of a person suffering\nfrom delusions or obsessions. The poem then may be\ntreated as a case of self-analysis,\u2014for the analyst is\nalso the analysed person, who attempts to relieve his\nmind by the process. He succeeds for a time ;\nbut\nthe confession, or analysis, has to be constantly repeated\nand, it appears, will have to be repeated at intervals\nthroughout the rest of his life. The Ancient Mariner\nof the dream is doubtless conceived of from this point\nof view ;\nand, like most dream-characters, he stands for\nmore than one person.\nHe stands first for Freud, whose book on The Inter-\npretation of Dreams (which I was then studying) is\nlargely concerned with an analysis of his own dreams.\nThe story of the Ancient Mariner, moreover, has a\ngeneral resemblance to the legend of the Wandering\nJew, and Freud's analysis shows how strongly his own\nemotional attitude in life is coloured by the fact of his\nbeing a Jew, in a country where the Anti-Semitic senti-\nment is still strong.\nThe other dream-character, Sherlock Holmes, the de-\ntective, represents the analyst only, not the analysed\nperson. Primarily he too stands for Freud, for he not\nonly smokes,1\nbut is also addicted to the use of cocaine.\nCocaine is associated by me with Freud, because, as I\nhad read two or three days before the dream (see The\nInterpretation of Dreams, pp. 143-144), he had written\n\" an essay on the coca plant, which drew the attention\nof K. Koller to the anaesthetic properties of cocaine. . . .\nShortly after Roller's discovery, my father had ....\nbecome ill with glaucoma ; he was operated upon by my\nfriend, the eye-specialist, Dr. Konigstein. Dr. Koller\nattended to the cocaine anaesthetisation, and thereupon\nmade the remark that all three of the persons who had\nshared in the introduction of cocaine had been brought\ntogether on one case.\" This statement occurs in the\ncourse of an analysis by Freud of one of his own\ndreams ; he also says that he had been thinking that,\n1\nFor the association of \"smoking\" with psychoanalysis and Freud,\nsee \" The Kaiser \" dream, above, p. 63 ; see also below, p. 95.\n\f94 Alice Johnson. [part\nif he ever had glaucoma, he would go to Berlin to be\noperated on.\nFurther analysis of my dream reveals a number of links\nbetween it and this case of Freud's, and it is noteworthy\nthat the links consist chiefly of plays on words, (of which\nhe gives many examples in his cases). Thus, a berlin\nis defined in my dictionary as \"a four-wheeled vehicle\n[like a bus] of the chariot kind, first made at Berlin \"\n;\nglaucoma is a disease of the eye caused by \"an opacity\nof the vitreous humour, giving the eye a bluish-green\ntint,\" the word being derived from the Greek glaukos,\nbluish-green or sea-green. The Greek word (see Liddell\nana Scott's Lexicon) is used especially of the sea and\nof eyes. In the latter case, it originally meant glaring\nor gleaming, with the collateral notion of fierce. Glaucus\nwas a fisherman, who became a sea-god (Ovid, Met. XIII.\n898). Cf. my Ancient Mariner, with the glittering eyes,\nin the four-wheeled vehicle.\nFreud's dream (op. cit. p. 142) was that he had\nwritten a monograph on a plant ; the slang meaning\nof the word \" plant \" in English is a hoax. In my\ndream, the man smokes ;\n\" to smoke a person,\" in slang\nlanguage, means to hoax him.\nFreud, if he went to Berlin as he was imagining, would\ngo by train. In my dream I think of calling the driver's\nattention by pulling a cord, and think of this as the\nmeans of communication (with the guard) used in trains.\nAnother series of associations starts from some phrases\nin a Holland script (quoted in Proc, Vol. XXII. p. 215),\nwhich apjmrently suggested several factors in the dream :\nIs she asleep ? No, she's talking. That chimney smokes . . .\nI want you to understand me but I have so few chances to\nspeak.\u2014it's like waiting to take a ticket and I am always\npushed away from the pigeon-hole before I can influence her\nmind ... A peck of pickled pepper . . .\nA faint far glimmer\na flickering light\nFive different influences\nhave tried to write\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n95\nIn the Holland script, \" she \" generally means the\nautomatist, and \" I \" the \" control,\" i.e., the influence\npurjjorting to inspire the script. Transferring this\nconception to the dream, it would seem that \" she\n\"\nis the dreamer, who, in the dream, is \" talking \" ; while\nthe \"control\"\u2014the \"five different influences\" of the\nscript\u2014is the other chief dream-personage, the man,\nwho is a composite of several different characters, and\nwhose glittering eyes are perhaps partly suggested by the\n\" flickering light \" of the script . Also there were five\npersons in all in the bus (including the driver).\n\" Waiting to take a ticket \" may happen in a bus,\nbut the script phrases seem to apply rather to taking\na ticket for a train at a railway station.\n\" Is she asleep ? No, she's talking. That chimney\nsmokes \" is, as mentioned above, (see the analysis of\n\" The Kaiser \" dream, p. 63) a reminiscence of a sentence in\nHuman Personality, Vol. I. p. 55, relating to a case\nin Breuer and Freud's Studien iiber Hysterie ;\n\" '\nThe\ntalking cure,' or '\nchimney-sweeping,' as Fraulein 0.\ncalled it, was practically equivalent to confession under\nhypnosis.\" The chimney that emokes, then, is one that\nwants sweeping, or that has not yet been swept ; \u2014that\nis, there is something wrong, something incomplete or\nunsatisfactory, in the analysis.\nIn the dream, objection is made to smoking \" inside\nthe bus.\" Now \" bus \" is an anagram for \" sub,\" which\nboth Mrs. Holland and I constantly used, in corre-\nsponding with each other, as an abbreviation for \" sub-\nliminal.\" The idea seems to be that the subliminal\nthoughts should be clear, not smoky ;\nsmokiness, or\nobscurity, should occur only on the roof of the bus,\n\u2014\nthe supraliminal.\n\" Bus,\" again, is the abbreviated form of \" omnibus,\"\n\u2014a word suggesting Jung's view that there is a stratum\nof the subliminal which is common to everybody.\nAnother association between the smoking man of the\ndream and Mrs. Holland occurred to my mind later.\nIt consisted in a phrase in a script of Miss Verrall's\n(Mrs. Salter), as follows :\n\" An old Dutch pipe with a\n\f!><; Alice Johnson. [part\ncurved stem\u2014Dutch windmills.\" A note by Mr. Pidding-\nton on this phrase suggests that it is a veiled reference\nto Mrs. Holland. There are in Miss Verrall's scripts,\nso far as known to me, only three other references to\nthe country or people of Holland, one of which is as\nfollows :\n\" Round the world for ever and aye 1\n\u2014der\nfliegender Hollander.\" The Flying Dutchman is of course\na variant of the Wandering Jew, who is associated above\nwith the Ancient Mariner. It is to be understood that Miss\nVerrall's, like Mrs. Holland's, scripts, together with a great\nquantity of unpublished notes on them, are extremely\nfamiliar to me, so that when I think of any one of them,\nit cannot fail to remind me of many other connected ones.\nThe smoking man was first associated by me with\nGaboriau's Monsieur Lecoq, and his twofold character as\nthe analyst and the analysed person corresponds with the\ntwo chief characters in the book,-\u2014the detective, Lecoq,\nand the accused person (le prevenu), Anne-Marie-Martial,\nMarquis de Sairmeuse, who calls himself \" Mai,\" and\nwhose real name and history Lecoq is trying to discover.\nThe comparison of the analyst to a detective and of\nthe analysed person to a supposed criminal may be\nthought odd, even if, as in the case of this story, the\nperson accused of the crime is acquitted in the end.\nThe situation arises, of course, from the procedure of the\nTrench criminal law, as distinguished from the English :\nin the former, the accused person is assumed to be\nguilty and has to prove himself innocent ; whereas in\nthe latter he is assumed to be innocent until the crime\nis proved against him. I think that the dream-self\nselected a French rather than an English detective story\non this very account, as representing the Freudian atti-\ntude. For Freud's method of procedure, in his Inter-\npretation of Dreams, certainly lends itself to the view\nthat he is searching for what he calls primitive\u2014or\nwhat others might call degenerative\u2014tendencies, and that\nhe takes up the position of assuming always that they\nexist and that the burden of proof rests throughout on\nhis opponents.\n1\nMatthew Arnold, The Forsaken Merman.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n97\nBoth Lecoq and \" Mai \" have glittering eyes, like the\nAncient Mariner ; and on one occasion they travel\ntogether in a police van, in which there are three other\npersons, making five altogether, as in my bus.\nIn view of the plays on words already noted, in-\ncluding the anagram \" bus \" for \" sub,\" the following\nmay also be pointed out :\n(1) The name \" Ancient Mariner \" resembles the name\n\" Anne-Marie-Martial.\"\n(2) This latter, again, resembles \" Anna,\" the Christian\nname of Fraulein O., the inventor of the epithet\n\" chimney-sweeping \" (see above), who suffered from an\naffection of the eyes, among other symptoms.\n(3) The initials of \" Ancient Mariner \" reversed give\nthe first two letters of the prisoner's pseudonym \" Mai.\"\n(4) An anagram for \"Mai\" is \"I am,\"\u2014that is, the\ndreamer is one of the persons concealed in the composite.\n(5) The first three letters of Lecoq's name, reversed,\ngive the initials of Dr. Long, the analyst whose paper\nprecedes mine, and who follows the school of Jung.\n(6) Lecoq is very often described as the \" jeune agent.\"\nThe initials of these words, reversed, give my own initials.\n(7) The French word \" jeune \" corresponds to the\nGerman \" jung,\" suggesting the analyst Jung, who writes\nboth in French and German.\nI need hardly remark that the above resemblances or\ncoincidences are 'purely accidental ; an unlimited number\nof such could be found in many other directions, and\nno significance of any kind is to be attached to them\nin themselves. But I believe that my subliminal selected\nGaboriau's book to assist in the make-up of the dream\npartly because\u2014in addition to the fact that the story,\nwith its two principal characters, lent itself to the general\ndream-scheme of the analyst and the analysed person\n\u2014\nthere happened to be these coincidences between the\nnames of the characters and the names of those analysts\nand analysed persons who would naturally occur to my\nmind. Thus, by the side-wind of these purely accidental\ncoincidences, several instances of the analyst and analysed\ntypes are introduced into the composite.\nG\n\f98 Alice Johnson. [part\nIt seems that the dreamer appears in this group of\npersons as being more in sympathy with the Swiss than\nwith the Vienna school of psychoanalysis. What is found\nobjectionable in the dream-man is his smoking\u2014the\ncharacteristic that especially connects him with Freud.\nThis is represented in the dream as causing confusion\nand obscurity in a region that should be clear. 80\nFreud's constant and, as I think, greatly exaggerated\nemphasis on the sexual side of life seems to me to\nobscure the very issues which he is attempting to clear up.\nSummary.\nThe analysis shows that this dream is concocted\nprimarily from four sources :\n(1) Coleridge's Ancient\nMariner ; (2) Gaboriau's Lecoq, involving Sherlock\nHolmes ; (3) Freud's Interpretation of Dreams ; (4) the\nHolland script quoted on p. 94.\nBy combining ideas derived from all these sources,\nwe arrive at the notion of two generic or typical persons,\nthe analyst and the analysed person ; and these two are\nfused, by a process which we may compare to a chemical\nsynthesis, into the single composite dream-character, the\nSmoking Man.\nReversing the process, we find that the Man may be\ndecomposed into two main characters : (a) Sherlock\nHolmes, who represents the Analyst only ;\n(b) the\nAncient Mariner, who still combines the two types of\nAnalyst and Analysed person.\nThe two characters-\u2014themselves composite\u2014may in turn\nbe decomposed further into their factors or elements,\nand we find that in both cases the factors are held\ntogether by invisible threads of connection, which we\nmay compare to the forces of chemical affinity or attrac-\ntion. The connecting threads consist in plays on words,\n\u2014\nonly revealed through the analysis. The notion of plays\non words has been borrowed by the dreamer from Freud's\nInterpretation of Dreams and from the Holland script, which\nabounds in them ; it is partly, perhaps, on account of this\ncommon characteristic that the book and the script have\nbeen utilised jointly in the production of the dream.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-A nalysis. yy\nContinuing the decomposition of the dream-characters,\nwe find that : (a) Behind Sherlock Holmes (the detective)\nstands Freud (the analyst). They are connected by the\nCocaine association, and by the puns on the slang use\nof the words \" plant \" and \" smoking.\"\n(b) Behind the Ancient Mariner stand : (1) Freud,\nboth as analyst and analysed person, associated with\nthe Ancient Mariner through : his imagined journey to\nBerlin (berlin = bus) ; his feared glaucoma (glaukos = blue-\ngreen, sea-green ;\nglittering eyes. Glaucus, the fisherman,\nor mariner) ; his Jewish blood (the Ancient Mariner\nlike the Wandering Jew).\n(2)\n\" Der fliegende Hollander,\" that is, Mrs. Holland,\nconsidered as an analysed person.\n(3) Anne-Marie-Martial, the accused person of Gaboriau's\nstory ; behind whom stands Fraulein Anna 0., the\nanalysed person referred to in the Holland script.\n(4)\n\" Mai,\" the pseudonym of the accused person ;\nbehind whom stands the dreamer, as an analysed person,\nthrough the anagram \" I am.\"\n(5) Lecoq, \" le jeune agent,\" i.e. the detective ; behind\nwhom stand three persons in the capacity of analyst,\nviz. Dr. C. E. Long, Dr. Jung, and the dreamer.\nPost-script.\nThe above dream had been studied with great care,\nand several accounts of it had been written out in the\nendeavour to make it clear, first to myself and after-\nwards to my readers. I had long seen that its scheme\nincluded the two types of analyst and analysed person,\nthat the latter category included automatic writers as\nwell as dreamers, and that one automatist, Mrs Holland,\nwas included in the composite.\nIn view of all this, it seems odd that I should have\noverlooked the connection between the name \" Mai \"\nand Mrs. Verrall, whose name was Margaret, but who\nwas always called \" May \" by her friends, including\nmyself. Also her second name (de Gaudrion) was French,\nwhich might have afforded another clue. Nevertheless,\nit was not until some time after the final draft of the\n\f100 Alice Johnson. PART\nanalysis was written out\u2014and nearly seven months after\nthe occurrence of the dream\u2014that it suddenly flashed\non me that \" Mai \" was Mrs. Verrall.\nMrs. Verrall, then, is one of the conglomerate company\nin the Bus.\nAbout three weeks after the discovery of Mrs. Verrall\nin the \" Bus,\" another equally obvious discovery was\nmade with the same suddenness, viz. that the Smoking\nMan included also Mrs. Piper.\nMrs. Piper's is a name that lends itself to puns, and has\nin fact been frequently punned on in the scripts ;\ne.g.,\nin a Holland script given in Proc. Vol. XXV. p. 273 :\n\" Piper, sit thee down and write\nIn a book that all may read\n\"\n\u2014a quotation from Blake's Introduction to \" Songs of\nInnocence.''' See also allusions to the Pied PijDer of\nHamelin in Miss Verrall's scripts quoted in Proc. Vol.\nXXII. pp. 67-68. These scripts and others by Mrs.\nVerrall and Mrs. Piper, quoted in the same section as\nforming a cross-corres}Dondence with them, are full of\nplays on words.\nThe first play on Mrs. Piper's name that has been\ndetected in the scripts occurs in an early Holland script,\nas follows :\n\" The next pick of pickled pepper will be rather a\nsurprising one. Mrs. Piper . . .\n.\"\nThis of course alludes to the nursery rhyme, \" Peter\nPiper picked a peck of pickled pepper.\" Cf. \"a peck of\npickled pepper \" in the Holland script quoted above\n(p. 94) as the source of several elements in the dream.\nI at first omitted this phrase from the extracts quoted\nfrom the script, not seeing its significance in regard to\nthe dream. It affords, I think, a clear proof that Mrs.\nPiper was included in the \" dream thoughts \" as an\nanalysed person.\nI take it that the general idea at the back of this\ndream is that, in spite of more or less serious differences\nof opinion and of outlook between the different real\npersons represented in it, there is much in common\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 101\nbetween them. They are all in the same \" Bus \"\n;\ni.e.,\nthey are all concerned with and deeply interested in the\nstudy of the subliminal, and their views in regard to it\nwould harmonise in many respects.\nThe dreams analysed in this paper are all given in the\nchronological order of their occurrence, with the exception\nof the one next to be quoted. This occurred at a date\nabout half way between the \" Golden Stairs \" and\n\" Bacchae \" dreams, but for the purposes of my general\nargument is placed here.\nDream. \" The Astronomer's Bath.\"\nI was in my lodgings, talking to a former fellow-lodger,\nMrs. L. She remarked that she wanted to take a bath, and\nwould take one at the astronomer's. I got the impression\nthat this would be something of an elaborate kind, perhaps\nlike a Turkish bath. So, knowing that her means were very\nlimited, I asked \" Wouldn't that be rather expensive 1\n\" She\nsaid, \" Yes.\" I said, \" Then why not take a bath in this\nhouse 1\n\" She replied that, as she was no longer living in\nthe house, she did not like to do so. I urged her to ask the\nlandlady's leave for it.\nAt the end of our talk, we seemed to be standing together\nat the top of the backstairs in my old home, outside the door\nof my old night nursery.\nThe following are the chief associations with the items\nof this dream which occurred to my mind and were\nnoted the next morning :\nMrs. L. had to work hard, often beyond her strength,\nto keep herself and her children. She could have got\nhelp from her relatives, but preferred to be independent.\nI thought her over-scrupulous in making claims for her-\nself ;\nthus, it was characteristic that she should have\nrefused to ask for a bath that would cost nothing in\nher old lodgings, and preferred to pay for one elsewhere.\nA bath : a simple thing ;\ntalcing a bath is the most\npleasant part of one's toilet ; it would be very dis-\nagreeable to be so poor as to be unable to have one.\n\f102 Alice Johnson. [part\nBut as a child I disliked my bath, because it was always\ncold. A bath is a frequent religious symbol. I was\nbrought up as a Baptist, but was never baptised.\nAt the Astronomer's : the only one of my acquaintances\nthat I could think of who had any concern with astronomy\nwas a relative, then absent at the front, though not near\nthe fighting line. I was therefore occasionally, but not\nacutely, anxious about him. A marked characteristic of\nhis is an unusual degree of truthfulness and accuracy ;\nhe is unusually careful not to make a statement unless\nhe knows it to be correct.\nStars : my own interest in stars is chiefly literary rather\nthan scientific ;\nlegendary stars : the Ejnphany star,\n\" Heaven's youngest-teemed Star,\"\n1\nthe herald of a new\nepoch. Frequent mythological connection of stars with\nbirth, e.g., in Virgil's \" Messianic \" Eclogue (Eel. IV. 6) :\n\"Now the Virgin 2\nreturns to earth, and the Saturnian\nreign [the age of gold] begins again.\" 3\nThe backstairs : associated with childish terrors and\nimaginings ; a dark and gloomy place, haunted by the\nunseen presences of giants, robbers, and wild beasts.\nHalf way up the stairs led into a dark cupboard, which,\nI believed, opened into a \" secret room.\" I often visited\nthis imaginary room in dreams, but it remained shadowy\neven then. The only real danger of the backstairs was\nthat one sometimes met black beetles there,-\u2014the most\nterrible objects that could be met anywhere. The front\nstairs, on the other hand, was a safe, well-lighted, and\ncheerful place ; but by going up the backstairs one saved\nthe front stairs carpet, and so acquired merit. And at the\ntop one reached the safe and j)leasant haven of the nursery.\nThese earliest associations with the dream obviously\nfail to explain its central problem, the \" Astronomer's\nBath.\" I went on turning this over in my mind at\nintervals, and thinking of various literary and legendary\nideas\u2014ancient and modern\u2014about stars ;\ne.g., the con-\n1\nMilton, Hymn on the Morning of Chrises Nativity.\n2 The constellation Virgo is identified with Altcri, Astraea, or Justice.\nFor Justice taking leave of earth, cf. Georg. II. 474.\n3 Cf. Milton's Hymn on the Nativity, stanzas XIV., XV.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n103\nception of the system of stars as exemplifying perfect\nobedience to divine laws ;\n\u2014\" His will is our peace \" ;\n1\nand other of the numerous allusions, literal or symbolic,\nto astronomy in Dante. I had once begun to make a\nlist of all his references to the constellations, and\nshortly before the dream had read a book, by M. A.\nOrr, called Dante and the Early Astronomers, which shows\nhis intimate acquaintance with the science of Astronomy,\nso far as it was known at his time, and the almost\ninvariable accuracy of all his allusions to such specific\nfacts as the relative positions of stars, sun, and moon,\nin the heavens at different times of the day and night\nand at different seasons of the year, the precession of\nthe equinoxes, etc. (Cf. above, my associations with the\n\" Astronomer.\") All this had interested me for the light\nit threw on Dante's many-sided character.\nIt was not, however, until several months after the\ndream that it suddenly flashed on me that my \" Astro-\nnomer \" was Dante himself, and\u2014at the same time\n\u2014\nthat his \" Bath\n:\n'\nwas the river of Lethe, \" which takes\naway from men the memory of sin \" (Purg. XXVTII. 128),\nwith its twin stream Eunoe, which restores the recollection\nof good. The impression came to me with the same feelings\nof sudden recognition and absolute certainty of the correct-\nness of the recognition as in the case of the \" Bacchae\n\"\ndream, described above, p. 47 ; the only difference being\nthat the \" Bacchae \" was recognised immediately after\nwaking, and Dante not until several months later. Con-\nsidering that my subliminal self must have known\nperfectly well all the time who the \" Astronomer \" was,\nit strikes me as noteworthy that the knowledge was\nwithheld so long from the supraliminal.\nAs to Lethe, it will be remembered that after Dante\nhas climbed all the terraces of the Purgatorial Mount,\nhe enters the Earthly Paradise or Garden of Eden at\nthe top, and advancing into it finds his way barred by\nthe stream of Lethe, on the other side of which he\nsees in turn Matilda, the mystic procession of the Divine\nCar, and Beatrice with her attendant nymphs.\n1\nPar. III. 85.\n\f104 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe next step in the analysis of the dream was taken\nsome months later in the recognition of the Backstairs as\nan \" infantile \" symbol of the Purgatorial Mount which\nhas to be climbed before Lethe can be reached. With\nits imaginary monsters and other perils the Backstairs\nrepresents the horrors of Hell and the pains of Purga-\ntory ; and it leads to the nursery at the top, which by\ncomparison was an Earthly Paradise, and which contained\nthe bath. As observed in the dream, the \" bath \"\n(whether the nursery one or Lethe) was \" rather ex-\npensive \" ; much had to be gone through before one\ncould arrive at it.\nThe apparently childish character of this analogy is on\na par with many metaphors in the dreams treated of in\nthe present paper. Its appropriateness in this case will\nbe seen if we consider that the necessity for some sym-\nbolic new birth is a conception inherent in many\nreligions, including the Christian :\n\" Except a man be\nborn again, he cannot see the kingdom of God \" (John\nIII. 3).\nThe Earthly Paradise represents a return to the state\nof primeval innocence ; it was the \" place chosen for\nnest of the human race \" (Purg. XXVIII. 77), the place\nof \" the golden age and its happy state \" (ibid. 140).\nIt is a Paradise of the archaic\u2014one maj perhaps say,\nthe infantile\u2014type, the return to a supposed ideal past.\nBut, in the Divina Commedia, it is not the goal, but only\na temporary resting-place where the soul is prepared for\nthe real Paradise beyond. \" Thou shalt be (says Beatrice\nto Dante) for a short time a dweller in this forest, and\nwith me for ever thou shalt be a citizen of that Rome\nwhereof Christ is a Roman \" (Purg. XXXII. 100-102).\nThe Bath.\nIt is odd that Dante should in the dream be desig-\nnated \" the Astronomer,\"-\u2014almost as odd as if one were\nto allude to Milton as \" the Astronomer.\" It is equally\nodd that Lethe should be described as \"a bath,\" for the\nroot-idea of Lethe is a water which men drink, in order\nto forget their woes, not a water in which they bathe.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 105\nDante, however, lays stress on the cleansing property\nof the water. He is drawn by Matilda into the stream\nup to his neck (a gola, Purg. XXXI. 94) ; when he is\nnearly over, he hears the words Asperges me 1\nbeing sung\n(1. 98) ; then Matilda dips his head and makes him\nswallow some of the water ;\nfinally she draws him out\nand leads him bathed (bagnato, 1. 103) into the circle\nof the four nymphs, handmaids of Beatrice. Further,\nwhen Dante first enquires about Lethe in Hell, Virgil\ntells him (Inf. XIV. 136-138) :\n\" Lethe thou shalt see,\nbut out of this abyss, there where the spirits go to wash\nthemselves (a lavarsi) when their guilt has been removed\nby penitence.\"\nThis, I rejDeat, is not the usual conception of Lethe.\nIn the sixth Aeneid (as in Plato's \"Vision of Er\") it\nis only after the spirits have been purified by purgatorial\npains that they are allowed to come and drink of the\nwaters of Lethe (Aen. VI. 735-751). Similarly in the\nPurgatorio, Dante goes through all the stages of purifi-\ncation from sin ; the marks of the seven deadly sins on\nhis forehead (Purg. IX. 112) have been erased one by one\nat the top of each of the Seven Terraces (Purg. XII.\n98, 121-134, etc.), making his ascent of the Mount con-\nstantly easier, and he has gone through the purging\nfire at the top, before he enters the Earthly Paradise\nand comes to Lethe. The function of his Lethe is not\nto purify from sin, but to take away the memory of sin.\nWashing does not seem a natural way of doing this,\nand the fact that Dante, unlike earlier writers, speaks\nof being washed in Lethe is one that I had never con-\nsciously noticed till the dream drew my attention to it ;\nnor is the point alluded to in any of the commentaries\nthat I have read, before or since the dream.\nOne reason for the dream epithet of \" Bath \" is, I\nthink, to be found in the fact that Dante had a com-\npanion in this \" bath,\" viz. the poet Statius, who had\njoined him and Virgil on the Fifth Terrace and accom-\npanied him through the rest of Purgatory. Readers of\n1\nPsalm LI. 7, \" Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean : wash\nme, and I shall be whiter than snow.\"\n\f106 Alice Johnson. [part\nthe Proceedings will remember that the Statius episode\nwas referred to in certain Willett scripts expounded by\nMr. G. W. Balfour in Vol. XXVII. pp. 221-243. In\nhis opening statement Mr. Balfour refers to some earlier\nWillett scripts which purported to give the answer of\nMyers to the question :\n\" What does the word Lethe\nsuggest to you ?\n\" The scripts treated of in Mr. Bal-\nfour's paper had nothing to do with Lethe, but were\ninterpreted as referring to Purg. XXII. 73-91, in which\nDante speaks of the baptism of Statius, and to two\narticles by Dr. Verrall, entitled \" To follow the Fisher-\nman \" and \" Dante on the Baptism of Statius,\" repub-\nlished posthumously in his Collected Literary Essays :\nClassical and Modem. These scripts purported to be\ninspired by Dr. Verrall.\nIt happens that my personal interest in Dante was\nfirst excited by a conversation with Dr. Verrall, who\nremarked in the course of it that he thought Dante's\nthe only conception of Paradise that could satisfy both\nthe feelings and the intellect of an educated modern\nman (I am not, of course, professing to give his exact\nwords, but only the gist of what he said). It would\nseem, therefore, that my dream contains an implicit refer-\nence to Dr. Verrall, and to this paper of Mr. Balfour's.\nCf. my \" Astronomer \" and the Willett script of Sept. 8,\n1913 {Proc. Vol. XXVII. p. 224) :\n\" What moves the\nstars and all the heavenly bodies ? Dante makes it clear \"\n;\nthe allusion being to the last line of the Paradiso :\n\" The Love that moves the sun and the other stars.\"\nCf. also my \" Bath \" and the quotation from the Punch\npoem associated with Dr. Verrall (op. cit. p. 237) :\n\" And when I take my Tavender,\nMy Tavender or Tub.\"\nThe connection between my dream and the Statius\nsubject is further confirmed by the occurrence among\nmy first associations with \" stars \" (see above, p. 102)\nof the line from Virgil's Messianic Eclogue :\n\" Now the\nVirgin returns to earth, and the Saturnian reign begins\nagain \" ; for it was to this very passage that Statius\n\fLXXV.] Dream-A nalysis. 107\n(Purg. XXII. 70-72) ascribed his (supposed) conversion to\nChristianity.\nDr. Verrall in his two papers above mentioned analyses\nthe grounds for Dante's belief that Statius had been con-\nverted and, at a certain specified date, secretly baptised :\n\" Before, as a poet, I brought the Greeks to the rivers of\nThebes, I had myself received baptism \" {Purg. XXII. 88-89),\nin, says Dr. Verrall, continuing to expound Dante, \" the\nriver, according to the familiar figure, of baptism. This river\nhe long hesitated to pass ; he '\nhalted on the other side,'\nas a man who was no hero might, when to be baptised\nwas to be in danger of death,\u2014though, as he tells us, the\ndelay cost him centuries of expiation upon the purgatorial\nmountain.\" (Collected Literary Essays, p. 194.)\nHere, then, is another \" expensive bath,\" like that of\nthe dream, where \" baptism \" is mentioned among the\nfirst associations (see above, p. 102) with the word \" bath.\"\nBut, Dr. Verrall points out, it is almost certain that\nDante was mistaken in thinking that Statius had ever\nbeen converted ; in that case Statius (like the dreamer)\nwas never baptised. Note that Baptists, founding them-\nselves on the custom of the New Testament and of the\nfirst Christians, practise only adult baptism and retain\nthe primitive procedure of immersion. In both these\nrespects Statius and the dreamer, if they had been\nbaptised, would have been treated in the same way.\nThere are, thus, two \" baths \" which may legitimately\nbe connected with the \" Astronomer,\" Dante, both asso-\nciated with leading incidents in the Commedia (in which\nthere is, so far as I can remember, no other \" bath\n\"\nof any importance) ; both are baths in rivers ; in both\nStatius takes part, but Dante only in one. The dream\nno doubt refers to both baths, and the further analysis\nof it was directed towards discovering the significance\nattached to each.\nThe Lethe \" Bath.\"\nThis was associated by me with the references to Lethe\nin the automatic scripts published in the Proceedings,\nespecially to :\n\f108 Alice Johnson. [part\n(1) The Lethe of Ovid {Met. Book XI. Fable VII.),\nwhich rises in the Cave of Sleep, \" through which the\nrivulet, trickling with a murmuring noise amid the\nsounding pebbles, invites sleep \" (11. 603 seq.). From this\nCave dreams issue forth (11. 615-648) to impose themselves\non men (see Proc. Vol. XXIV. pp. 86-144).\n(2) The Lethe of Virgil (see Proc. Vol. XXIV. pp. 86-\n144; and Vol. XXV. pp. 113-193).\n(3) The Lethe of Dante (see Proc. Vol. XXII. pp. 237,\n264, 268, 269, foot-note ; and Vol. XXV. pp. 214-216).\nThe articles on the scripts containing these allusions\nwere naturally familiar to me, as was the ordinary\nmytholog3T\nof Lethe. But the Lethe of Dante was the\none in which I had long been most interested, as it\napjDearecl to me that it had special meanings which were\nnot explained satisfactorily by any of the commentaries\nthat I had read ; and the dream seems to be an attempt\nto carry on further and clear up my somewhat vague,\nrambling, and intermittent waking reflections on the\nmatter.\nIt aj^pears that the original function of Lethe was\nmerely to act as a drug or narcotic to deaden the\nsenses and make men forget trouble and pain. In the\nOrphic and later mythology,1\nit develops into a rite of\ninitiation ; the man dies, symbolically or actually, to\nlive again or to be re-incarnated. Between the two\nstages or two lives, he passes through a purgatorial\nperiod and then drinks of Lethe, so that in the second\nlife he has no recollection of anything that preceded it.\nThus in the Sixth Aeneid, (11. 713-715) :\n\" Souls to whom\nFate owes a second body drink at the wave of the river\nof Lethe draughts that free from care and long oblivion.\"\n\" All these, when they have turned the wheel through a\nthousand years, God summons in a great multitude to the\nriver of Lethe, so that without memory they may see\nthe vaulted sky again, and may begin to wish to return\ninto bodies \" (11. 748-751).\n1\nSee Plato's Myth of Er, Republic, 613e-621d. For an account of the\n\" Orphic Tablets,\" see Miss J. E. Harrison's Prolegomena to the Study of\nGreek Religion, pp. 573 et seq.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis . 109\nThis passage is probably the immediate source of Dante's\nLethe, but he diverges at once from his model. To begin\nwith, he imports into Lethe for the first time, or at least\nstrongly emphasises, the idea that it causes oblivion of\nsin, the original notion being that it caused forgetfulness in\ngeneral. Then, with his passion for exact topography, he\ndoes not confine himself (as Virgil does, Aen. VI. 704 ff.) to\nthe bank where the souls about to be re-incarnated gather\nto drink of the water, but works out the relationship\nof the stream as a whole to his scheme of the universe,\nmaterial, as well as spiritual. Virgil places his infernal\nrivers, Acheron, Styx, and Cocytus, near the entrance to\nHades, and Lethe in its purgatorial region. Dante, whose\nPurgatory is sharply marked off from his Hell, meets\nLethe first in the lowest depth of Hell, i.e. the centre\nof the earth. Here Lucifer is fixed, embedded up to his\nmiddle in the frozen swamp of Cocytus.\nThis \" Creature who was once so fair \" has now a\nhead with three faces, yellow, red and black, under each\nof which is a pair of gigantic flapping bats' wings, and\nthe winds raised by these keep the swamp always frozen,\nwhile his three mouths are perpetually gnawing the three\narch-traitors, Judas Iscariot, Brutus, and Cassius. In\ncontrast with the crude, barbaric, and almost grotesquely\nhideous appearance of this monster is the environment,\nwhich shows his esoteric character. The three infernal\nrivers, Acheron, Styx and Phlegethon, are formed from\nthe tears of the whole human race from its early ages\nonwards,1\nand they all run down into Cocytus {Inf. XIV.\n113-119), into which also the tears of Lucifer himself flow\nperpetually (Inf. XXXIV. 52-54).\nOn another side the swamp receives also the waters\nof Lethe, flowing down into it from Purgatory,2\nand\n1\nSee the ;i\nLiterary Parallel \" above, p. 40.\n2\nThe ruscelletto of Inf. XXXIV. 130, which flows from Purgatory into\nHell, is nowhere named, but is said to be Lethe in a foot-note in the\nTemple Edition, which I have been accustomed to use. At the time of\nmy dream, I did not know that the point had ever been disputed, so\nthat for the dream-self the rivulet in question was Lethe. Many of the\ncommentators say nothing about it. Mr. Edmund Gardner, in the\nTemple Primer of Dante, following Dr. Carlyle, says that the rivulet\n\f110 Alice Johnson. [part\ncarrying thence the memories of sins from which the\npurified, souls have been set free. Thus Lucifer suffers\nperpetually his own pain and the pains of the whole\nhuman race, and lives in the eternal memory and con-\nsciousness of evil.\nSo. in accordance with the general plan that Purgatory\nshould be a counterpart to Hell, there is a place and a\nfunction for Lethe in Hell. It is at the top of Purgatory,\nand at the bottom of Hell. Its function in Purgatory\nis to obliterate the memory or consciousness of evil ; its\nfunction in Hell is the contrary,-\u2014to emphasise and\nconserve the memory of evil. For the effect on Dante\nhimself only, it might be sufficient for him to drink the\nwater ; but how, in that case, could the water be so\naffected as to produce any result in Hell ? So he not\nonly drinks the water, but also bathes in it, with the idea,\nas I conceive, that the evil memories will both be de-\nstroyed in himself and washed off him, so that they may\nbe carried down to Hell.\nThe scheme has the incidental advantage that the water\nrunning down into the centre of the earth wears a narrow\nwinding channel in the rock,\u2014a sort of short cut out of Hell,\npassage through which is in general not permitted (see\nPurg. I. 40-48), and it is through this channel that Virgil\nbrings \" the remains of sin that has been purged in Purgatory back to\nLucifer.\" Prof. J. A. Stewart describes the whole course of Lethe as\nbeing on the surface of the earth. Mr. H. F. Tozer, in his English\nCommentary on Dante's Divina Commedia, says that the rivulet is\ngenerally regarded as Lethe, but expresses doubt of the correctness of\nthis interpretation.\nLongfellow, in a note to his translation, calls it Lethe. A. J. Butler\nin a note says, \" The brook is generally held to be the outflow of Lethe,\nwhich rises at the summit of the Mountain of Purification,\" and he\napparently accepts the view. Mr. Paget Toynbee, in his Dante Dictionary,\nunder \" Lete \" refers to the \" ruscelletto \" of Inf. XXXIV. 130, and to\nthe \" cieco flume \" of Purg. I. 40, which are undoubtedly the same.\nDr. G-. A. Scartazzini, in his Enciclopedia Dantesca (Milano, 1896), says\nthat Lethe rises at the top of the Mount of Purgatory, flows through\nthe Earthly Paradise, falls to the foot of the mountain and from thence\npasses through the hollow of a rock down to the centre of the earth.\nI think therefore that the balance of evidence is on the side of the\nidentification of the stream as Lethe.\n\fLXXV. |\nDream-Analysis\n.\nIll\nand Dante climb up to the surface of the earth, at the\nantipodes of the spot whence they descended into Hell,\nand find themselves at the foot of the Mount of Purga-\ntory.\nThey do not meet with Lethe again till they come to\nthe Earthly Paradise, where again it differs in a marked\nway from its mythological prototype. Virgil (like Plato)\ndescribes the function of Lethe from a general and\nabstract point of view, as a process in the development\nof the soul. Dante conceives of the process as applied\nto himself, and tries to imagine exactly what effect it\nwill have. This not merely, I think, for dramatic purposes,\nbut because he thinks naturally in personal terms. The\ntwofold stream is thus described to him by Matilda (Purg.\nXXVIII. 127-133) :\nOn this side it descends with a virtue which takes from\nmen the memory of sin ;\non the other it restores the memory\nof every good deed. On this side Lethe, as on the other\nEunoe 'tis called, and works not except first it is tasted on\nthis side and on that. This exceedeth all other savours.\nFrom a psychological point of view the passage appears\nto me of great interest, since the question of Memory is\nthe central problem of psychology, if not (as Plato hints)\nof ethics. What we are conscious of and what we re-\nmember is only a small selection out of the whole\npossible field of consciousness and memory. But\n\" We forget because we must,\nAnd not because we will.\" 1\nTo be able to control the selection, to get rid of\nmemories of evil and horror that no longer serve\u2014perhaps\nhave never served\u2014any useful purpose,, and to recover and\nretain the desirable ones, would be a great gain both for\nhappiness and for efficiency.\nDante, having reached the summit of Purgatory, has\nalready repented of his sins and been purified from them ;\nto keep the recollection of them any longer will therefore\nbe useless and merely hampering. The water of Lethe\n1 Freud's view is of course the opposite of Matthew Arnold's.\n\f112 Alice Johnson. [part\ndelivers him from this useless burden. The memories\nfrom which he was delivered are described in the following\nwords which he addresses to Beatrice (Purg. XXXIII. 91-\n93) :\n\" I do not remember that I ever estranged myself\nfrom you, nor have I conscience thereof that gnaws me.\"\nThis is the only sin which is anywhere explicitly\nmentioned as having been forgotten through drinking\nof Lethe. I think we may infer that Dante himself\nregarded his sins against Beatrice and all that she stood\nfor in his life, if not as the sum, at least as \" the head\nand front of his offending.\"\nTo my mind the passage has not been fully appreciated\nbecause, in spite of the trend of modern, and especially\nof English, scholarship towards the literal interpretation\nof the Commedia as oj)posed to the earlier symbolic\ninterpretation of it, there is still too much tendency to\nregard Beatrice in the first place not as herself but as\nthe representative of Religion, while Virgil is thought of\nnot as himself but as representing Philosophy. Yet\nto an impartial person who reads the whole narrative\nwith no such preconception it must. I think, appear\nthat what Dante has forgotten through drinking of Lethe\nis the actual events of his life,-\u2014that is, the course of\ndissipation into which he fell after the death of Beatrice.\nLet us then next consider his personal relationship to\nBeatrice as compared with his relationship to the other\nchief character of the poem, Virgil.\nFor Virgil he has a great devotion and reverence ;\nbut there is nothing reciprocal in the relationship. Virgil\nis the man \" who goes by night and carries the light\nbehind him \" (Purg. XXII. 67) ; he is not deliberately\nshowing it to any one, and he does not know on whom\nit shines, or who is blind to it. Just such a relationship\nmay subsist between Dante himself and any one of his\nmodern readers. Dante does not suppose that Virgil\nactually came out of Limbo to enlighten him.\nOn the other hand,\u2014this it seems to me impossible\nto doubt,\u2014it was an essential part of his faith that\nBeatrice did actually and literally make a personal effort\non his behalf. For its efficacy, his own co-operation was\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n113\nof course necessary ; but the effect produced on him was,\nhe believed, due to something more than his own un-\nassisted efforts and aspirations. In the language of\npsychical research, Beatrice is a \" communicator \" ;\nVirgil is only a \" control.\" Throughout the Inferno,\nand the greater part of the Purgatorio, Virgil \" controls\n\"\nfor Beatrice ; afterwards she \" controls \" for herself.\nNow. after drinking the water of Lethe, Dante forgot\nthat he had ever sinned against her ; he could not\ntherefore realise in any adequate way her efforts for his\nsalvation. The water of Eunoe was necessary to restore\nto him the realisation of this. The idea of Eunoe as\nthe indispensable counterpart of Lethe is the most essential\nand original 1\npait of his whole conception.\nIt is strange that two such scholars as Mr. Paget\nToynbee and Prof. J. A. Stewart 2\nshould have taken\nPurg. XXVIII. 129 (\" dall' altra, d'ogni ben fatto la\nrende \") to mean that what is restored to the penitent\nby the water of Eunoe' is the memory of his own good\ndeeds, the advantage of which (according to Prof. Stewart)\nis that it enables him to preserve the continuity of his\nconscious life when he passes into Paradise. The final touch\nthat is to fit Dante for Paradise is not, surely, the contem-\nplation of his own virtues, but the virtues of Beatrice.\nThe functions of Lethe and Eunoe had already been\nexplained to him by Matilda (Purg. XXVIII. 121-132, see\nabove) ; but he had forgotten her explanation, and when\nhe saw the streams again, \" parting like friends that\nlinger,\" he had to ask what they were. It is explicitly\nstated that this forgetfulness was not due to the action\nof Lethe,\u2014it was a case of what might be called normal\nforgetfulness. Then, by the direction of Beatrice, Matilda,\nto \" requicken his fainting virtue,\" leads Dante and\n1\nIt has some resemblance to the Platonic notion of anamnesis or\nreminiscence,\n\u2014\" the recollection of those things which in time past\n[i.e., in some previous existence] our soul beheld when it travelled\nwith God,\"\u2014and to the Orphic Fountain of Memory, but was probably\ninvented by Dante independently of any mythological tradition.\n2\nPaget Toynbee, A Dante Dictionary, under \" Lete.\"\nProf. J.

I came\nback from the most holy waves, born again, even as new\ntrees renewed with new foliage, pure and ready to mount\nto the stars \" (Purg. XXXIII. 138-145).\nWe find as a fact that in the Paradiso the souls have\nstill some recollection of the faults of their lives on earth ;\ne.g., Piccarda remembers that her vows were slighted\n(Par. III. 56) ; Justinian remembers that he once held\nheretical opinions (Par. VI. 14) ; and the effect of their\npast lives is symbolised by their presence in the lower\nheavens, though it is explained that this is only an\nallegorical appearance (Par. IV. 34-43).\nIt is in the Third Heaven, the Heaven of Venus, that\nthe effects of the drinking of Lethe and Eunoe' are most\nclearly hinted at, though never specifically alluded to.\nCunizza of Romano says 1\n(Par. IX. 32-35) :\nHere I shine, because the light of this star had the mastery\nof me. But gladly I allow to myself the occasion of my\nlot, and it gives me no annoy.\nFolco of Marseilles, the Troubadour, says (Par. IX.\n95-108) :\nThis heaven is stamped with me, as was I with it . . . Here,\nhowever, one repents not, but smiles, not for the fault, which\nreturns not to the mind, but for the goodness which ordered\nand foresaw. Here one gazes into the art which makes beauti-\nful with so great affection, and the good is discerned whereby\nthe world on high turns that below.\nIn a note, Butler explains this speech to mean :\nWe feel no repentance for our fault, which indeed we have\nforgotten ; but we contemplate with joy the wonderful order\nof God's providence, which makes that love wherein we for-\nmerly erred an honour to us ; and we discern this same love\nin its highest manifestation, namely, as the power by means\nof which the whole course of the world is governed.\nCf. the \" Astronomer,\" who ends his poem with the words :\n\" L'Amor che move il sole e l'altre stelle.\"\n1\nOf this and the next quoted passage I give Butler's translation.\n\f3LXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n115\nI may quote also a comment by Mr. Edmund Gardner 1\non the speeches of Cunizza and Folco :\nGrief for past sin is absorbed in happiness in the divine\nmercy and in gratitude for forgiveness. For, in Dante's\nallegory, both Lethe and Eunoe have been drunken of. In-\ntellectual remembrance of these past evils remains to the\nsoul, but, as far as regards sensible experience, they are\nwholly forgotten : La col\/pa a mente non torna. \" In the City\nof God,\" says St. Augustine, \" the soul will be oblivious of\nsin, oblivious of sufferings, and yet not so oblivious of its\ndeliverance as to be ungrateful to its deliverer.\"\nThe personal application of this conception to Dante\nhimself is indicated by the fact that a thread of his\nown history is interwoven into the scenes of the Heaven\nof Venus through the allusion to his Ode, \" Ye who by\nunderstanding move the Third Heaven,\" (Par. VIII. 37) ;\nfor this Ode is in one of his sonnets associated with\n\" that Lady in whom I went astray,\" who is almost\ncertainly the \" Lady of the Window \" of the Vita Nuovav\n\u00a7\u00a7 36-39.2\nBut the passage which perhaps above all others shows\nthe inspiration of Eunoe' is Dante's last address to Beatrice\nin the Tenth or Highest Heaven (Par. XXXI. 79-93) :\n\" 0 Lady, in whom my hope is strong, and who didst\nendure for my salvation to leave thy footprints in Hell, for\nall the things that I have seen I own the grace and the\nvirtue by thy power and by thy goodness. Thou hast from\na slave drawn me to liberty through all those ways, through\nall the modes which had the power to do that. Preserve\nthe great work that thou hast wrought in me, so that 1113^\nsoul which thou hast healed may be unloosed from the body\nwell-pleasing to thee.\" Thus I prayed ; and she, so far away\nas it seemed, smiled and looked upon me ; then she turned\nback to the eternal fountain.\n1\nDante's Ten Heavens, p. 87.\n2 For a full exposition of this point, and of the relation of the Ode in\nquestion to G'onv. II., see Appendix II. of Mr. P. H. Wicksteed's trans-\nlation of the Convivio (Temple Edition, pp. 428-435), and his translation\nof Witte's Essays on Dante, pp. 423-432.\n\f116 Alice Johnson. [part\nTo sum up : The idea behind \" the Lethe Bath \" is,\nI take it, that the perfect life\u2014the goal of human\nendeavour\u2014involves the oblivion of evil and the perpetual\nand vital consciousness of good,\u2014the good to which\nDante was led by Beatrice.\nThe \" Bath,\" or Baptism, of Statms.\nThis\u2014the other factor of the Dream Bath\u2014is in Dante's\nscheme anterior to the Lethe Bath. As the latter is\nintimately bound up with his relationship to Beatrice,\nso the former is bound up with his relationship, and the\nrelationship of Statius, to Virgil.\nOne of the problems which most exercised Dante's\nmind was the fate of the \" virtuous heathen,\" many of\nwhom he saw in Limbo, the first circle of Hell, where,\nVirgil tells him, they are \" only in so far afflicted that\nwithout hope we live in desire \" (Inf. IV. 42). These\nwere \" men of much worth \" and \" great sadness took\n[him] at the heart on hearing \" of their condition and their\npermanent exclusion from heaven. In the same Canto\n(52-63) Virgil describes Christ's descent into Hell, from\nwhich he liberated certain souls, so that a large number\nof Old Testament saints rose to Heaven. This of course\nis in accordance with the traditions of the Christian\nChurch ; what is interesting is Dante's own choice of\nheathen that were saved. Apart from the Emperor\nTrajan, whose legend formed part of the Church tradition,\nall the others are vouched for, or closely associated with,\nVirgil. They are :\n(1) Statius ;\n(2) Cato, the warder of Purgatory (Purg. I. 31) ; i.e.\nCato of Utica, described by Virgil in Aen. VIII. 670,\nas dispensing laws to the departed spirits of virtuous\nmen ;\n(3) The obscure Kipheus (Par. XX. 68, 100-148) whom\nVirgil in Aen. II. 426, calls of all the Trojans the man\nmost just and most observant of the right.\nRipheus appears in the Sixth Heaven, that of Jupiter,\nthe distinguishing Virtue of which is Justice, and here\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n117\nDante tries to find an explanation of the apparent arbi-\ntrariness of the Divine selection of the virtuous heathen\nfor salvation or the reverse. He appeals to the souls\nthere, who, if any, should understand the nature of\nJustice, to \" solve the great fast which long hath held\nme hungering, because on earth I found no food for it\n\"\n(Par. XIX. 25-27). They understand his question intui-\ntively :\n1 \" Thou didst say :\n'\nA man is born upon the\nbank of Indus, and there is none to tell of Christ, nor\nnone to read, nor none to write ; and all his volitions\nand his deeds are good so far as human reason seeth,\nsinless in life or in discourse. He dieth unbaptised and\nwithout faith ; where is that justice which condemneth\nhim ? where is his fault, in that he not believes ?\n'\n\"\nThe question may not present itself in the same terms\nto a modern reader, but the problem is the same,\u2014\na\nproblem especially acute at the present day,\u2014how can\nthe sufferings of innocent persons, brought on them not\nby their own fault, be reconciled with a just governance\nof the universe ?\nIt was perhaps the very intensity of his feeling on\nthis subject,-\u2014the feeling that an answer to the question\nmust be found, must somewhere exist, \u2014that led Dante\nto inscribe over the gate of his Hell the strange words\n(Inf. III. 4-6) :\n\" Justice moved my High Maker ; Divine\nPower made me, Wisdom Supreme, and Primal Love.\"\nBut he cannot permit himself to formulate anything\nbeyond the declaration with which the spirits in the\nHeaven of Jupiter end their discourse (Par. XX. 133-135) :\n\" Ye mortals, hold yourselves straitly back from judging ;\nfor we, who see God, know not as yet all the elect.\"\nNow, of course, the one of all others for whom Dante\ndesired salvation was Virgil ;\nbut a man of his intellectual\nhonesty could not, in the circumstances of his time,\nreconcile it with his conscience to believe that Virgil\nwas saved. So he endeavours to satisfy his love for\nVirgil by everything possible short of this. He takes\nhim as his Master and Leader up to the top of the\n1\nHere, as frequently throughout the Cow\/media, telepathy as a normal\nmode of communication between spirits is assumed.\n\f118 Alice Johnson.

I venture to add the conjecture that there was\na special motive which led Dante to seize eagerly on\nwhatever evidence he could find,\u2014viz. the desire to do\nhonour to Virgil by ascribing to him not only the poetical\ninspiration, but also the conversion of Statius.\n\" The sparks (says Statius, Purg. XXI. 94-98 :) which\nwarmed me, from the divine flame whence more than a\nthousand have been kindled, were the seeds of my poetic\nfire : of the Aeneid I speak, which was a mother to me\nand was to me a nurse in poesy.\" So much is matter\nof common knowledge ;\nbut, he adds, (Purg. XXII. 64-\n73) :\n\" Thou first didst send me towards Parnassus to\ndrink in its caves, and then didst light me on to God.\nThoii didst like one who goes by night and carries the\nlight behind him, and profits not himself, but maketh\npersons wise that follow him, when thou saidst :\n'\nThe\nAvorld is renewed, justice returns and the first age of man,\nand a new progeny descends from heaven.'

Lethe and\nEunoe.\nOther Dante Dreams.\nMy contemporary notes of dreams for a period of\n37 days show that during that time eight dreams (in-\ncluding the \"Astronomer's Bath\") occurred, relating,\neither directly or through their first associations, to Dante\ntopics. I give these briefly in chronological order :\n(1) A phrase which, so far as I could remember, ran\nthus :\n\" If only one could get crowned, one could go\nahead.\" It was clear in the dream that to be \" crowned \"\ndid not mean to have authority over, or to be superior\nto, other people ; it meant a position of freedom and\nindependence for oneself. Many months later I traced\nit to Purg. XXVII. 142 : \"I crown and mitre thee over\nthyself \" (the crown and mitre being the symbols of\ntemporal and spiritual authority),\u2014Virgil's last words to\nDante, after he had brought him to the top of the Mount\nof Purgatory.\n(2) Dream of the \" Golden Stairs,\" one association with\nwhich was the Jacob's Ladder of the Paradiso, see\nabove, p. 44.\n(3) Dream of the Pool of Bethesda, associated with\nJacob's Ladder (because of the angel that came down\nand troubled the water, see John V. 4), and hence with\nthe Paradiso.\n(4) Some vague phrases, including the words :\n\" Con-\nquering combatants\u2014Leah and Rachel \" ; associated with\nDante's dream of Leah, see Purg. XXVII. 100 ff. The\nsame topic re-ajypears much later in the \" Two Dolls\n\"\ndream, see above, p. 73.\n(5) Dream of \" The Astronomer's Bath.\"\n(6) An apparently vague and incoherent dream which\nI could remember only in a very fragmentary way as :\nSomething to do with Bergson ;\nforgetting something makes\na confusion and catastrophe, as when in a novel a misunder-\nstanding makes things go wrong. A phrase : \"I will keep\nto myself the gates, while thou, the ancient thou \" The\n\f120 Alice Johnson. [part\nphrase seemed to break off here. \" Thou \" was somehow\nconnected with a desolate wintry landscape.\nThe combination of Bergson and \" forgetting \" suggested\nto me at once his work on Memory. This fits in closely\nwith the Lethe and Eunoe associated with the \" Astro-\nnomer's Bath,\" although I did not identify the \" Bath\n\"\nuntil several months later.\nThe first associations with \" gates \" were Blake's lines :\n\" Entering through the gates of birth, And passing\nthrough the gates of death \" ; and the description in\nPurg. X. 41-42, of a sculpture representing the Annunci-\nation :\n\" There she was fashioned who turned the key\nto open the supreme love.\"\nLater associations were with the Gates of Hell (Inf.\nIII. 1-12) and of Purgatory (Purg. IX. 76). \" The ancient\nThou \" is probably a reminiscence of the last lines of\nthe inscription over the Gate of Hell :\n\" Before me were\nno things created but eternal, and eternal I endure ;\nleave all hope, ye that enter.\"\n(7) A dream, one of the chief associations with which\nwas Rossetti's picture, Beata Beatrix.\n(8) Dream of the seven-branched candlestick ; associ-\nated with the seven candlesticks borne at the head of\nthe Procession of the Divine Car in Purg. XXIX. 43.\nDuring the period in which these dreams occurred,\nI was aware that allusions to Dante were occasionally\ncropping up ; but having failed to decipher the first\nand fifth dreams of the series I had no idea of the\nextent and significance of the allusions. When they are\nput together, it becomes clear that much subliminal or\ndream thinking on these topics had, unknown to my\nwaking self, been going on, which tends to confirm in\na general way the significance I attach to the \" Astro-\nnomer's Bath,\"\u2014it tends, that is, to show that the meanings\nexisted in the dream, and were not only read into it\nafterwards.\nGeneral Conclusions.\nIn the Introduction to this paper I said that I had\nbeen unable to find in my dreams any evidence of the\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 121\nworking of Freud's \" Censor.\" It may be well here to\nexplain further what was meant by this statement.\nCases are quoted above in which the analysis shows\nthat sexual topics, not in the \" manifest \" content of\nthe dream, exist in its \" latent \" content. Considering\nhow much human affairs in general are bound up with\nthe subject ;\nconsidering also how strongly it is pressed\non one's attention in the process of being analysed, it\nwould be extraordinary if this were not so. And one\nmay be sure that if the element could not be found,\nFreudians would point to its absence as the strongest\npossible evidence of the influence of sex on the mind of\nthe dreamer, as shown by the repression.\nBut the sexual topics revealed in the analysis of these\ndreams contain nothing calculated to shock the waking\nself. Why, then, should they be \" censored \" ? Further,\na great variety of other, non-sexual, topics are veiled\nin the same way, and only revealed through analysis.\nThe veiling, it is to be noted, does not occur only in\nthe dream itself ; it may, or may not, be continued long-\nafter waking ; one may remain for months blind to some\nobvious interpretation. Examples of this are given above.\nE.g., in the \" Fabulous Horse \" dream, I recognised at\nthe outset of the analysis that Miss Freund's surname\nstood for Freud (and consequently for his theories), but\ndid not see that her Christian name stood for Mount\nIda. In the \" Bus \" dream, I noticed Mrs. Holland as\na factor of the smoking man, but not Mrs. Verrall or\nMrs. Piper. I recognised the \" Bacchae \" immediately on\nwaking, but took some months to discover the\n\" Astronomer's Bath.\"\nThese examples are typical of a very large number of\nsimilar ones in my records, and they seem to me to\nnegative any theory of \" censorship.\" They can only\nbe explained on this theory by the argument : Sexual\nmatters are concealed in dreams ; therefore what is\nconcealed in dreams is sexual. This is the logical fallacy\nthat appears to me to permeate the Freudian doctrine.\nI would suggest as a substitute for the Censor theory\na hypothesis based on two generally accepted facts :\n\f122 Alice Johnson. [part\n(1) that it is of the essence of the dream-self to clothe\nits ideas in pictures, images, or metaphors, rather than\nin language ; it does not follow connected logical lines\nof thought ; and (2) that many parts of a dream (as\nobserved in the Introduction) are forgotten on waking.\nThe first characteristic does not necessarily involve\nany lack of clearness in the presentation ; on the con-\ntrary, metaphors are often the best vehicle for conveying\nvivid impressions to the mind.\nSecondly, the remembered fragments of a dream are\ncomparable to peaks of a mountain range, emerging from\na mist that covers all but their summits ; we cannot\nsee how to pass from one peak to another. So, in the\nwaking memory of a dream, many of the connecting\nlinks are lost, and what remains is naturally incoherent.\nThere is, then, ground for thinking that, if we could\nremember all the parts, the meaning of the metaphors\nwould be clear.\nFreud, if I understand him aright, holds that the\nforgetfulness is, in effect, deliberate,\u2014that it is due to\nthe action of the Censor. My hypothesis is that the\nrecollection is deliberate,\u2014that it is due to the desire\nof the Self to understand itself.\nI believe the recollection to be deliberate partly\nbecause, in the course of a dream, one is often conscious\nof an effort not to lose the thread of what is happening.\nThis can hardly be a mere mechanical effort to remember ;\nit must be also, I think, an attempt to understand. It\nis an effort of what may be called the half-waking self.\nIn my belief, the dream-self co-operates with this half-\nwaking self, sharing in its desires and aims. In accord-\nance with their common aim, a dream-image is con-\nstructed, into which, by virtue of its symbolic character,\nmanifold meanings can be compressed. The image, on\naccount of its simplicity, will be comparatively easy to\nremember ; \u2014all the more if something slightly bizarre,\nincongruous, or grotesque, is tacked on to it, likely to\nattract the attention and curiosity of the half-waking or\nwaking self, and so to fix it in the memory. The jest,\nsilly or childish in itself, conceals a serious purpose.\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis\n.\n123\nBut if the dreamer were not amused by the jest, he\nwould not take the trouble to look behind it for its\nserious meaning. This may perhaps partly account for\nwhat psychoanalysts call the \" infantile \" element in\ndreams. The childish ideas are often peculiarly suited\nfor the purpose of metaphor.\nThe following is a recent dream which I cpiote in\nillustration of my hypothesis :\nDream. \" The Lock of Hair.\"\nI was at a meeting at which one of the Classical Lecturers\non the Staff of Newnham College had to give a discourse on\nVirgil. It appeared that there was some particular Virgilian\nsubject on which she had to speak. This was represented\nby a diagram on a black-board, vaguely resembling a geo-\nmetrical diagram, on the right side of which was a wavy\nfigure, drawn in bold and clear- outline. This was said to\nbe a lock of hah. It seemed the most important part of\nthe subject.\nAfter waking, I remembered some recent correspond-\nence on literary subjects, classical and other, with a\nrelative who was serving with the Red Cross in France.\nA letter received from him four days before the dream\nreferred to Virgil's conception of the character of Dido.\nIt then became clear that the dream alluded to her death.\nDido was mortally wounded, but (Aen. IV. 698 :)\n\" Pro-\nserpine had not yet reft the yellow lock from her head.\"\nAt last Iris, sent by Juno to release the spirit from the\nbody, severs the lock, as an offering to Dis, and the\nrelease is accomplished.\nThe same symbolism occurs in a passage in Horace,\nfamiliar to me, and appropriate to the general circum-\nstances of the correspondence above mentioned, as follows\n(C. I. 28, 15-20 T\n) :\nBut one and the same night awaits us all, and the path of\ndeath must once be trodden. Some the Furies give to make\nshows for grim Mars. The greedy sea is the destruction of\n1\nE. C. Wickham's translation.\n\f124 Alice Johnson. [part\nthose who go in ships. Of young and old without difference\nthe funerals crowd along. There is no head that imperious\nProserpine ever feared to touch.\nWickham notes on this :\nNone could die (acc. to Virg. Aen. 4, 698) till Proserpine\nhad cut a lock of hair from his head ; the idea being that\nthe dying man was a victim offered to the powers below,,\nas it was usual to begin a sacrifice by cutting some hairs\nfrom the forehead of the victim and burning them, Virg..\nAen. 6, 245.\nThe last reference is to the sacrifice made by the\nSibyl on behalf of Aeneas before his journey into Hades.\nThe death of Dido is of course one of the most striking\nand dramatic scenes in the Aeneid. The waking self\nwould probably picture it amid the main accessory cir-\ncumstances : the great funeral-pyre built up by Dido's\ncommand in the inner court-yard of her palace, ostensibly\nfor the purpose of working love-charms, but really for\nher own death ; the piling up on it of the relics asso-\nciated with Aeneas, including his sword ; Dido falling\non the sword, and the pyre bursting out in flames, as\nthe Trojan fleet escapes into the distant seas.\nIt is certainly not beyond the powers of the dream-\nself to produce such a picture. But the dream leaves\nall this on one side, and selects the far less striking\nincident of the severed lock. This incident, being symbolic,\ncomprises within itself more meaning than almost any\nof the other events. By means of the figure of the\nlock of hair and the single word \" Virgilian,\" the dream\ngives the whole story in a nutshell,\u2014and within the\ncompass of a very small nut. So simple an image was\nprobably easy to remember, and at the same time it\nexcited the curiosity of my waking self ; I at once\nbegan to ask myself : What is there in Virgil about\na lock of hair ? and soon hit on the answer to the\nquestion.\nIn the course of this dream, I went through the experi-\nence described above of being aware, in a half-waking,,\nhalf-sleeping state, that I was forgetting parts of it\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 125\nI was also aware of the effort to remember ;\nand I am\nstrongly inclined to think that my dream-self tried to\nmake me remember.\nAnalysis of the dreams makes it continually clearer\nthat they are occupied with the same subjects ,\n\u2014the\nsame interests, questions, and problems,\u2014as occupy my\nwaking thoughts. 1\nOf these, unfamiliar aspects are con-\nstantly presented, so that I do not in the dream\nrecognise the subject. When it is recognised, I generally\nfind that the dream has shed a fresh light on it of a\nkind which is often\u2014to me-\u2014extremely interesting. Since\nthe dream-metaphors fulfil the function of giving me\nnew ideas, it seems reasonable to suppose that the dream-\nself has selected them for this purpose,\u2014that they are\nintended to reveal, and not to conceal.\nIn the cases treated of in this paper, two facts come\nout through analysis by the association-method which\nseem to me to afford strong evidence for the validity\nof the method :\n(1) The associations with the items of a dream often\npoint to some literary source which is not apparent in\nits \" manifest \" content. When this source is referred\nto, it is generally, if not always, found that some other\nitems of the dream (or other associations with them),\nbesides those first discovered, have also been derived\nfrom it. Frequently the dreamer finds that literary details\nwhich he has forgotten and which are only recalled to\nhis memory by referring to the book, account for these\nother dream-items or associations Not infrequently he\nmay find them accounted for by details which he cannot\nremember ever having read before.\nThis, of course, is to be expected, since we all know\nthat the subconscious memory is far superior to the\nconscious.\nBut the facts furnish evidence confirmatory of the\nassociations, since, the more independent items we can\n1\nE.g., the story of Dido is of special interest to me partly because\nof references to it in the scripts ; see Mr. Piddington's paper on \" Cross-\ncorrespondences of a Gallic Type,\" in Proc. Vol. XXIX. pp. 30-38.\n\f126 Alice Johnson. [part\nfind corresponding to details in a book, the more probable\nit becomes that the dream has drawn on that book\nfor its imagery or dream-thoughts. And if this can be\nconsidered proved, other inferences about the dream may\noften be legitimately drawn.\nIncidentally we may observe that dreams derived from\nliterary sources lend themselves in a peculiar degree to\na scientific and precise psychological treatment, since it\nis easier to test one's memory of a book than of many\nother things.\n(2) The associations often reveal connections between\ndreams which their \" manifest \" contents fail to show.\nThus we have above the close relationship between the\n\" Queen Victoria \" and \" Kaiser \" dreams, and the carry-\ning on of the \" smoking \" symbolism (more than a year\nlater) into the \" Bus \" dream ; which also contained,\nas shown by the analysis, characters corresponding to\nthe dream-Queen-Victoria and Kaiser. We have also the\nintricate relationship between the \" Two Dolls \" and the\n\"Fabulous Horse\"; and we have a long series of Dante\nassociations. The Dante topic occurred (though for long\nundetected) on the first night on which I attempted to\nanalyse my dreams and continued at intervals up to\nthe present day.\nThese are only a few examples out of a very large\nnumber of such connections between dreams in my\nrecords. In fact I suspect that the dreams, if fully\nanalysed, would be seen to form a single continuous\nscheme of interconnected subliminal mental activity.\nWhen the dreamer has made out the meaning (for him)\nof some image or symbol which interests him,\u2014that is,\nwhen his normal waking consciousness has apj)rehended\nit,-\u2014it seems not unnatural that it should re-appear in\nhis future dreams. Thus the \" smoking \" symbolism of\nthe \" Kaiser \" dream had been made out by me long\nbefore it re-appeared in the \" Bus,\" and it has occurred\nmore than once since. Symbols of this kind, when\nrepeated, often appear with some additional feature,\nderived apparently from the normal waking thoughts\nabout them. Thus, the \"smoking\" appeared in a recent\n\flxxv.] Dream-Analysis. 127\ndream as a smoking chimney,\u2014after I had observed,\nwhile awake, that the origin of the symbol was a smoking\nchimney, not (as in the \" Bus \" dream) a smoking man.\nSuch an interweaving or interaction of sleeping and\nwaking thoughts might be expected to occur. The con-\ntinuity between the dream-thoughts in such cases seems\nto be assisted by, or may be entirely due to, their re-\ninforcement by the waking thoughts.\nBut what is more interesting is the continuity found\nbetween dreams in cases where the dream-thoughts have\nremained almost unnoticed, or at all events have not\nbeen consciously interpreted, by the waking self. Thus,\nmy \" Queen Victoria \" was consciously associated in a\nslight and vague way with the Queen in Alice's Adven-\ntures in Wonderland. I knew quite well, but did not\nconsciously think, that this Queen was the Queen of\nHearts. I thought very little about her and much more\nabout Queen Victoria. The sequel seems to show that\nmy subliminal, or my dream-self, had gone on thinking\nabout the Queen of Hearts ; it had thought of the\nabsurdity of the Queen of Hearts saying, \" Off with his\nhead,\"\u2014an antithesis which, obvious as it is, had not,\nI feel sure, ever occurred to my conscious mind ;\n1\nit\nsaw how other details in the story could be turned to\naccount, and constructed a second dream-scene out of it.\nAgain, long before the analyses of the \" Queen Victoria\n\"\nand \" Kaiser \" dreams had shown how many details in\nthe story had been used, its sequel, Through the Looking-\nglass, had already been utilised in the \" Two Dolls \" and\n\" Fabulous Horse,\" though this fact, again, was only\ndiscovered at a late stage of the analysis of these dreams.\nThe complicated web of allusions to Dante and Plato\nin the same dreams affords further evidence of the sub-\nliminal carrying on of thoughts from one dream to\nanother, with apparently very little assistance from the\nsupraliminal. E.g., the idea of using Aristophanes' myth\nagain in a quite different form, and the idea of combining\n1\nI mentioned this to a friend, who said that the idea was new to\nhim also. He added that this was probably because we both knew the\nbook by heart, not by head.\n\f128 Alice Johnson. [part\nit with the PJmedrus myth, must have been completely\n.subliminal.\nThe \" Fabulous Horse,\" again, through the association\nwith \" Ida Freund \" implies Mount Ida and Ganymede\nas a symbol of the soul liberated from earth. This\nconnects with \" Der Tod als Freund,\" associated with\nthe much earlier dream of \" The Golden Stairs,\" a link\nwhich, as stated above, p. 88, was not detected till the\nanalyst read the paper and drew my attention to it.\nReference was made in the Introduction to the question\nwhether the ideas that emerge in the analysis were really\nin the dream-thoughts, or whether\u2014-as a critic might\nsuppose\u2014they had merely been read into the dream\nafterwards. Freud says (The Interpretation of Dreams,\np. 157): \"All criticisms upon the dream and remarks\nabout it, although they have secured a place in waking\nthought, regularly belong to the latent dream content.\"\nThis statement, which at first sight may appear dogmatic,\nis expanded and discussed in his very interesting and\ninstructive chapter on \" The Dream-Work,\" from which\nI quote the following (pp. 262-263) :\nIt is true, of course, that particular thought connections\nfirst arise only during analysis ; but one may always be sure\nthat such new connections have been established only between\nthoughts which have already been connected in the dream\nthoughts by other means ; the new connections are, so to\nspeak, corollaries, short circuits, which are made possible by\nthe existence of other more fundamental means of connection.\nIt must be admitted that the huge number of trains of thought\nrevealed by analysis have already been active in the forma-\ntion of the dream, for if a chain of thoughts has been worked\nout, which seems to be without connection with the formation\nof the dream, a thought is suddenly encountered which,\nbeing represented in the dream, is indispensable to its inter-\npretation\u2014which nevertheless is inaccessible except through\nthat chain of thoughts.\nI understand this to mean that, though we can have\nno positive proof that the whole of the chain of thoughts\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis. 129\nsuggested by a given association has taken part in the\nformation of the dream, the existence in the chain of\na single link which seems clearly to have entered into\nthe dream affords presumptive evidence that the whole\nchain has so entered.\nWhile there is, I think, much to be said for this view,\nthe argument seems to dismiss too lightly the possibility\nthat the coincidence between a single item in the chain\nof associations and a single dream item may be merely\naccidental.\nIn any case it must be difficult to discover exactly\nwhat was in the dream thoughts and what was\nnot,\u2014to discover, that is, whether a given idea was\nthought of before the dream or after it. The difficulty is\nincreased by the continuity of thought (as shown in my\ncases) between dreams. Whenever a dream-thought can\nbe clearly traced to an earlier dream, we can at least feel\nsure that we have not read it into the later dream. We\ncannot say when it first arose ; but we can point to a\ndefinite date on which it was already in existence.\nThe dream has in it something intangible, Protean,\nelusive. No charm yet devised can actually seize and\nhold it fast till it delivers up its secret. Theoretically\nwe might expect that by some such means as hypnotic\nsuggestion the dreamer could be put back into the\ndream condition and could then give a full account of\nthe dream and of what it meant to him ; or that it\nmight be fully re-constructed through automatic script\nor crystal-gazing. For we know that lapsed memories\nare often recovered by such methods and one can hardly\ndoubt that the lapsed memories would supply many\nclues. But if, as the psychoanalyst conceives, the\nmemories and the ideas attaching to them are deejDly\nrooted in the subsoil of the whole personality, it will\nnot be enough to remove the surface soil from the roots.\nIt is not enough to consider the dream apart from the\ndreamer. The value of the association method lies in\nthe light it throws on the intimate relationship) of the\ndreamer to the dream.\nThe analysis does not profess to re-construct the dream\n\f130 Alice Johnson. [part\nas it was dreamt ; it may be that the task is inherently\nimpossible. What the analysis does is to reveal many\nideas and combinations of ideas which, it may fairly be\npresumed, have entered into the formation of the dream.\nThere is no positive proof\u2014from the nature of the case\nthere can be no positive proof-\u2014that they have so entered.\nThough his associations are facts known to the dreamer,\ntheir application to the dream, and its consequent inter-\npretation, may often to the dreamer himself seem obscure\nand conjectural ;\nmany of the associations appear at\nfirst sight to have no bearing on the dream. Gradually\nlight emerges on one after another and the dreamer\nbegins to see a real and vital connection between these\nideas which he knows to have existed in his mind and\nthe dream which appeared so remote from them. The\nprocess which begins in doubt and ends in conviction\nis liable to be reflected in his exposition of his analysis ;\nhe begins by suggesting as a possible interpretation what\nat a later stage he assumes as a certain one ; and to\na critical reader the proceeding must appear suspicious\nor arbitrary. What convinces the dreamer is the cumu-\nlative effect of seeing one point after another\u2014not in\none case only, but in case after case-\u2014fall into place\nas part of what looks like an elaborate and coherent\nscheme. It is difficult to convey such a cumulative\neffect to the mind of an outsider ; hence the analyst's\ndespair of convincing the man who has not experienced\nit. I have tried to overcome the difficulty by describing-\nmany instances at what T am afraid may appear an\ninordinate length.\nThere remains the more fundamental difficulty of\nexplaining the stress laid on certain apparently trivial\ndetails and not others. The reader may say : \u2014You\nchoose certain items from the dream and from the\nassociations and make a sort of story out of them ;\nobviously you could, if you liked, select other items\nand make quite a different story out of them. The\nonly answer I can make is : I admit that I select to\nsome extent both from the dream and from the associa-\ntions,\u2014the selection being, I may remark, largely involun-\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analys is\n.\n131\ntary. I select the tilings that appeal to me\u2014that are\ninteresting to me. I cannot explain why certain things\nare so much more interesting and important to me than\nothers ; I only know that it is so.\nI follow this semi-automatic process of selection and\nI find, to my surprise, that it leads me to a story which,\nto me, is interesting and to me seems the story predestined\nto be made out of those materials. Later I select again\nfrom the same stock in the same semi-automatic manner,\nand am led on again to a further story. But I never go\nback on my first story ;\nthis always turns out to be the\npreliminary stage of, or one episode of, the second.\nOther people, I dare say, could make a different story\nout of it, but I cannot. This, and no other, is my story, \u2014\n\" a poor tiling, but mine own.\" This, then, I believe\nto be the real meaning of my dream.\nThe hypothesis of the latent- content revealed by the\nassociations remains and must remain a hypothesis only.\nIts justification is that, as I have endeavoured to show,\nit offers a plausible, a reasonable and a self-consistent\nview of the facts. It seems to me then that the method\nmay be usefully added to other methods for investigating\nthe subliminal with which we have long been familiar,\n\u2014\nthe various hypnotic methods, the study of different kinds\nof dissociations of consciousness, of automatic writing and\nother forms of automatism. I regard it not as a substitute\nfor, but as a supplement to, whatever lines of research\nwe may believe to be sound and reasonable and which in\npractice we have found fruitful.\nI have also endeavoured to show that we may accept\nthe method as an admirable tool for working purposes\nwithout accepting the results obtained by any particular in-\ndividual through his use of the tool (an argument which\nof course cuts both ways). In my brief and admittedly\ninadequate discussion of some of the results obtained by\npsychoanalysts, I have referred to what appear to me\nto be serious flaws, due-\u2014as it seems to me-\u2014to premature\nattempts at the simplification of extraordinarily complex\nfacts,\u2014the attempt to refer to one cause phenomena that\nmay be due to a mixture of several causes.\n\f132 Alice Johnson. [part\nBut in a discussion it is generally easier to express\ndisagreement than agreement. Every one admits the\ngreat importance of sex in human life, whether in normal\nor abnormal conditions, though it must be a matter of\nopinion whether some have exaggerated, or whether others\nhave minimised its range. Meanwhile the controversy\nthat has raged round this particular point, and the\nviolence with which both sides have carried it on, have\ntended to obscure the wider issues of the subject. It\nhas to be remembered that psychoanalytic theories are\nbased on the study of pathological cases, whereas\npsychical research deals primarily with persons in a\nnormal condition. But, as Mr. Myers long ago pointed\nout, it is useful to study abnormal and normal psychology\nside by side, for the sake of the light they may throw\non one another. While in many respects psychoanalysis\nconfirms what was already familiar to those who have\nfollowed the work of the S.P.R. from the beginning, and\non the other hand psychical research confirms much\npsychoanalytic work, the two groups of workers under-\ntake different groups of phenomena and start from\ndifferent points of view. Collaboration between them\nshould therefore be mutually profitable.

In the absence of positive evidence to the\ncontrary, we must of course assume that the automatist\n\fLXXV.] Dream-Analysis . 133\n(or dreamer) directs his own mental activity. Evidence\nto the contrary depends not on the form, but on the\ncontent, of the automatic product ; it turns on the\nquestion whether any knowledge of verifiable facts,\nprovably unknown by normal means to the automatist,\nis manifested. In the dreams here given, there is no\nevidence of this ; whereas in the scripts discussed in\nour Proceedi?igs such evidence often exists, especially that\nfurnished by the cross-correspondences.\nIf, as I believe, these scripts are the joint production\nof the automatists and an intelligence external to all of\nthem, it is of great interest and importance to under-\nstand the part played by the automatists, without which\nno understanding is possible of the part played by the\nexternal intelligence.\nThe present paper, like Mrs. Sidgwick's article on\n\" The Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena\n\"\n(in Proc.

We recognise that there is more in the\nmind than is at any moment present in consciousness.\nWe can draw on our memories of past experience, and the\nquestion arises : How are we to conceive those traces of\npast experience ? What is the medium in which they inhere ?\nIt is around the facts of mental retention that the problem\nof the unconscious first arises in psychological inquiry.\nIf we feel compelled on methodological grounds to try\nto explain mental retention in psychological terms, we\nmay assume that past conscious process is conserved as\nmental traces or psychical dispositions which are in the\nmind but out of consciousness. And this we may do\nwithout reference to any knowledge we may already have,\nor may hi the future acquire, of the relations that exist\nbetween the mind and the nervous system. But the\ndifficulty of conceiving any form of psychical existence\noutside consciousness has led many psychologists to adopt\nsome other explanation of the conservation of past ex-\nperience. There are at least two mam forms of explana-\ntion which have been put forward as alternatives.\nOne form is that which would explain mental retention\nby the persistence of neural modifications which are\nassumed to be the concomitants of all mental process.\nIt may be described as the hypothesis of physical or\nphysiological dispositions. This is the view which is most\nfavoured by physiologists, but its adoption implies a\ndenial of the possibility of giving a direct explanation\nof experience in psychological terms. It is inconsistent\nwith the view that the mind itself has a structure, and\nit reduces all mental life to a series of disjointed mani-\nfestations whose only connecting links are the structural\nand functional interrelations of the material systems\nwhose activity is accompanied by consciousness.\n\f136 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nMany psychologists, moreover, refuse to admit accounts\nof material modifications into psychological explanation.\nBut if unconscious psychical dispositions are denied, and\nif physical dispositions are held to be irrelevant, it\nbecomes necessary to postulate dispositions that are not\nunconscious and are not merely physical. We must\nassume that past experience is conserved as a system\nof persisting modifications of consciousness which are of\nsuch low intensity that they have no power to influence\nthe direction of attention.\nIt is to modifications of consciousness of this kind\nthat Professor James Ward alludes in his hypothesis of\nsubconscious presentations. \"It is a fact easily verified,\"\nhe says, \" that we do not distinguish or attend separately\nto presentations of less than a certain assignable in-\ntensity. On attaining this intensity presentations are\nsaid to pass over the threshold of consciousness, to use\nHerbart's now classic phrase. What are we to say of\nthem before they have attained it ? After they have\nattained it, any further increase in their intensity is\ncertainly gradual ; are we then to suppose that before\nthis their intensity changed instantly from zero to a\nfinite quantity, and not rather that there was also a\nsubliminal stage where too it only changed continuously ?\nThe latter alternative constitutes the hypothesis of sub-\nconsciousness.\" 1\nThe facts that give support to the hypothesis of sub-\nconscious presentations are well recognised by psycho-\nlogists. Some of them have to be taken into account\nin any description of mental process. When, for example,\nwe are engaged in a train of thought or a course of\nobservation, there is much in consciousness that is not\nreferred to the object presented. There is a felt back-\nground of presentations which are not discriminated\nbecause they are not attended to. There is always the\nmass of organic sensations and many impressions received\nthrough the special organs of sense, which have no\nsignificance for the thought of the moment, except in\nso far as they form a setting and give a colour to the\n1\nEncyclop. Brit. 10th edit. Vol. XX. p. 47.\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 137\ntotal mental state. Such undiscriminated experiences are\nsometimes referred to as subconscious.\nIt may be maintained, however, that all such mental\nstates, in so far as they are conscious at all, must be\nregarded as being above the threshold ; that the vague-\nness or indistinctness of the contents of the margin or fringe\nof consciousness is due to a want of distinctness of\nrepresentation of the objects they stand for, not a lower\ndegree of consciousness as such ; that the threshold is a\nknife-edge which sharply delimits consciousness, and that con-\nsciousness per se is something that does not admit of degrees.\nA contrary opinion is expressed by some writers, as\nfor example, by Professor Lloyd Morgan, who, since he\nbelieves that mental process and cerebral process are\nbut one process viewed from different aspects, feels bound\nto suppose that below the threshold of consciousness\nthere is something of the same order of existence as\nthat which lies above the threshold. To this part of\nthe total field he gives the name of Infra-conscious. This\ninfra-consciousness is in his view \" not merely negative,\nbut something positive and existent,\u2014what, for want of\nbetter terms we may call the not-yet or the not-quite\nconscious.\" 1\nAs has been already said, many writers refer to that\npart of the supraliminal field of consciousness which is\nmarginal as subconscious, but in Dr. Ward's hypo-\nthesis of subconscious presentations he must be held to\nrefer more particularly, as does Dr. Lloyd Morgan when\nhe speaks of the infra-conscious, to hypothetical mental\nmodifications, partaking of the nature of consciousness,\nyet occurring beneath the threshold. The evidence in\nfavour of a subconsciousness of this kind is mainly in-\ndirect, and its cogency is perhaps due to the satisfaction\nit gives to the demand for continuity in the psychical\nseries, rather than to the strength of the arguments that\ncan be brought forward in support of this interpretation\nof the facts.\nBut this hypothesis of modifications of consciousness\noccurring below the threshold has an interest and an\n1\nIntroduction to Comparative Psychology, p. 34.\n\f13S T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\napplication outside the problem of mental retention. It\nprompts us to inquire if there is available any empirical\nevidence of the occurrence of conscious process of any\nkind that is not discernible on introspection. So far as\nthe psychology of the normal is concerned there are\npractically no facts which can be brought forward in\nsupport of such a view, that cannot be explained more\nor less satisfactorily in some other way. But the question\nis pressed upon us with great insistence when we enter\nthe domain of abnormal psychology. We find that many\nof the conceptions arrived at in the study of the normal\nmind do not seem to fit the facts of observation and\nexperiment in this strange territory. Our notion of the\nmind as one and indivisible, of consciousness as a unity\nsubject to subdivision only in so far as different parts\nof its content may be more or less attended to and\ndiscriminated, of the threshold as a line sharply dividing\nthe conscious from the unconscious,\u2014all seem to fail us\nwhen we come to examine the mental peculiarities of\nabnormal persons or of normal persons under certain\nunusual conditions.\nThe data of abnormal psychology which are supposed\nto afford some answer to the question of what goes on\nbeneath the threshold\u2014the problem of the subliminal\nas we may call it\u2014are of a varied and conflicting\ncharacter ; and certain conceptions which are not felt\nto be necessary in the description of the structure and\nprocess of the normal mind have been widely employed\nin their elucidation. The most important of these con-\nceptions is the hypothesis of \" dissociation of conscious-\nness \" elaborated by Pierre Janet in explanation of the\nsubconscious phenomena exhibited in hysteria.\nThe presence of consciousness existing below the\nordinary threshold may be discovered on examining the\nnature of the anaesthesia that is such a common feature\nof hysterical disorders. But instead of being of the low\nintensity ascribed by writers on normal psychology to\nall modifications of consciousness that may take place\nbelow the threshold, these subconscious mental activities\nmay be found to be more intense than those that occur\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 139\nabove the threshold. For example, the limb thit is\nanaesthetic for the supraliminal consciousness is found to\nbe hyperaesthetic when the subliminal is interrogated.\nAccording to Janet hysterical anaesthesia of a limb\nis due to a dissociation from the personal consciousness\nof the system of sensations connected with the limb.\nAnd in the same way in other hysterical affections,\nlarger or smaller systems of ideas fail to get incorporated\nwith the mass of ideas synthesised in the personal con-\nsciousness, and seem to take on independent functioning\non their own account. In Janet's opinion all subconscious\nphenomena are due to the presence of such dissociated\nstates, and all manifestations of subconscious mental\nactivity are evidence of hysterical dissociation.\nSome of the most convincing evidence of the occurrence\nof conscious process below the ordinary threshold is\nafforded by certain hypnotic phenomena and in one form\nof the condition known as double or multiple personality.\nAnd the most striking characteristic of the consciousness\nso disclosed is that it is a \" clear \" consciousness which\nexists concomitantly with the clear consciousness of\nwaking life. It is, like the subconsciousness of hysteria,\na form of psychical existence so manifestly different from\nthe hypothetical modifications of consciousness of low\nintensity to which the term subconscious has been\napplied by writers on normal psychology, that it is\nnecessary to call it by some other name in order clearly\nto mark the difference between the two kinds of sub-\nconsciousness. Dr. Morton Prince has proposed that it\nshould be called a co-consciousness. This term does away\nwith the implication of diminished intensity conveyed by\nthe prefix of the word subconscious, and at the same\ntime it emphasises the concomitance of the subliminal\nconscious process with that which goes on above the\nordinary threshold.\nMany experiments and observations have been recorded\nby different investigators which all point to the same\nconclusion. They point to the possibility of conscious-\nness becoming split up so as to give rise to two or more\nmutually independent systems of thought, instead of\n\f140 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ngoing along in one unitary stream. And since the personal\nconsciousness existing above the ordinary threshold has\nno awareness of the thoughts of the secondary system,\nthe latter system is spoken of as being dissociated, just\nas the subconscious sensations or ideas of hysteria are\nsaid to be dissociated.\nBut this notion of dissociation as applied to isolated\ngroups of sensations or ideas is very hard to grasp.\nJanet's view of a dissociated idea growing and develop-\ning on its own account seems ojyposed to the very first\ndatum of psychological investigation,\u2014the fact that the\nonly sensations, or ideas, or thoughts of which we have\nany knowledge are the sensations or ideas or thoughts\nof some personal self. If, as Janet says, the ensemble\nof sensations coming from an arm or leg may become\ndissociated from the totality of consciousness, and yet\ngive evidence of still possessing consciousness on their\nown account we feel bound to ask, If these sensations\nare felt, who feels them ? Janet would seem content\nto leave them floating about in the void without being\nclaimed or owned by any thinker. But other writers\nwho are convinced of the fact of co-consciousness arc\nless easily satisfied. Consequently we find that some\npsychologists get over the difficulty by postulating the\nexistence, below the ordinary threshold, of a self to whom\nthose feelings and thoughts belong. And as a logical\ncorrelate of such a supposition in the case of abnormal\nco-consciousness the possession of a secondary self must\nbe postulated for every one. Writers who take up this\nposition enunciate views on the nature of the sub-\nconscious which are based on the supposition that the\nphenomena observed in abnormal states may be regarded\nas revealing the existence of modes of consciousness that\nare common to every human mind.\nIt was on a supposition of this kind, supported, it\nis true, by evidence drawn from other fields of investi-\ngation, that Frederic W. H. Myers based his hypo-\nthesis of the subliminal self. Although Myers expressly\ndenied that by this term he meant to imply that there\nare two correlative and parallel selves existing always\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 141\nwithin each one of us, yet his work has been held by\nmany of his critics and adherents to teach this doctrine,\nand the weight of his authority has been made use of\nby popular writers in support of opinions of the crudest\ncharacter regarding the existence and the nature of a\nsubconscious self.\nWhen Myers introduced the term subliminal self the\nword subliminal was already in use in psychology to\ndefine those sensations which are too feeble to be indi-\nvidually recognised. He proposed to extend the meaning\nof the term so as to make it cover all that takes place\nbeneath the ordinary threshold ;\u2014not only those faint\nstimulations whose very faintness keeps them submerged,\nbut also \" sensations, thoughts, emotions, which may be\nstrong, definite, and independent, but which, by the\noriginal constitution of our being, seldom emerge into that\nsupraliminal current of consciousness which we habitually\nidentify with ourselves.\" By the subliminal self he meant\nthat part of the self which is commonly subliminal, and\nhe believed that no self of which we can here have\ncognisance is in reality more than a fragment of a larger\nself,\n\u2014\" revealed in a fashion at once shifting and limited\nthrough an organism not so framed as to afford it full\nmanifestation.\" 1\nA conception of a subliminal self in some way similar\nto that of Myers has been advocated by Dr. Boris Sidis\nas a result of his investigations on the Psychology of\nSuggestion. He maintains that in everyone there is a\nsubconscious or subwaking self below the threshold of\nthe waking self -consciousness. In the subconscious, he\nlike Myers, includes both co-consciousness and those\nfaint stimulations whose very faintness keeps them sub-\nmerged. He says, \" In many cases it is not easy to\ndetermine what the exact character of the subconscious\nmanifestation is, how far it is conscious, dimly conscious,\nhow far it has gone toward the development of an\nindependent personality, and how far it shades in the\ndirection of the purely physiological.\" 2\nHe is mainly\n1\nHuman Personality, Vol. I. pp. 14-15.\n9\n-Proc.

Especially\ndoes he fail to make clear the status of those ideas and\nfeelings which are \" clear \" in co-consciousness. He would\nascribe their occurrence under certain conditions to a\ncleavage between the two selves, and the consequent\nattainment of self-consciousness by the originally diffused\nconsciousness of the subconscious. But how the trans-\nformation of a diffused consciousness into self-consciousness\nis brought about he does not tell us.\nA new avenue of approach to the problem of the\nsubliminal was opened up by Sigmund Freud in the\ncourse of the elaboration of his psychoanalytic technique ;\nand his theoretical formulation of his views on what\nhe has termed \" The Unconscious \" is having an in-\ncreasingly marked effect on contemporary psychology.\nFreud does not make use of the metaphor of a threshold\nin his descriptions, but he confines the use of the word\n\" conscious \" to those mental processes of which we are\naware at a given moment.\nConsciousness in Freixd's writings means and means only\nwhat is, as we should say, supraliminal at the moment.\nOn the other hand, everything that is subliminal at the\nmoment he calls unconscious\u2014in the wider of two senses\nin which he uses this word. Ordinarily, he says, ideas\nare latent in the unconscious because their activity is\nslight, because they are weak ideas, aiid when they become\nactive and strong, they become conscious. But psycho-\nanalysis has shown that some ideas may be active and\nstrong and yet never emerge into consckmsness. Thus\nlatent ideas of two kinds exist beneath the threshold,\nand since they behave so differently when they become\nstrong, Freud proposes to call foreconscious or pre-\n1\nIbid. p. 326.\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 143\nconscious those which on becoming strong become conscious,\nwhile he reserves the term unconscious (proper) for those\nwhich do not emerge into consciousness no matter how\nstrong and active they may be.\nThis distinction between preconscious and unconscious\nideas is not a primary one. Both kinds of ideas are\nunconscious from the point of view of the conscious\npersonality. But it is claimed that psychoanalysis clearly\nshows that it is only when an idea is unacceptable to the\nconscious personality that it is doomed to remain un-\nconscious. Its repulsion from consciousness, its imprison-\nment in the unconscious, is due to living forces\u2014to\nrepression, and the psychoanalyst's attempt to drag it\ninto consciousness is met with what is known technically\nas resistance.\nFreud's views on the unconscious and its relation to\nrepression were derived in the first place from the analysis\nof hysterical patients, but his investigations on dreams\nand other peculiarities of mental process in healthy people\nconvinced him that unconscious ideas in this restricted\nsense exist in every human mind,\u2014not merely as isolated\nand occasional occurrences, but as a vast and ever present\ninterconnected system. It is to this system that he\napplies the term The Unconscious.\nThis is not merely another name for the subconscious\nconsidered as faint states of consciousness or for co-\nconsciousness, nor can it be regarded as synonymous with\npsychical dispositions or still less with physical disposi-\ntions. Freud claims the right of psychology to describe\nmental process in psychological terms and repudiates the\nnotion that it is necessary or permissible to fall back on\nmaterial systems to fill up the gaps in the conscious\nseries. The unconscious is psychical but it has a dynamic\ncharacter which distinguishes it from the relatively static\nsystems of psychical dispositions.\nHitherto upholders of the doctrine of subliminal activity\nhave not claimed that there are any distinctive peculiar-\nities in the contents of that part of the mind which is\nordinarily subliminal. To Myers it appeared to be both\na lumber room and a treasure house. But on this\n\f144 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nquestion Freud expresses himself with conviction, in one\nof those sweeping generalisations which have so often\nbeen a stumbling block to his readers. The unconscious,\nhe says, contains nothing but wishes and such psychic\nformations as may have grown around them. These\nwishes are instinctive impulses, or original components\nof the instincts, that have been repressed. Originally\nthe gratification of these impulses afforded pleasure, but\nin the course of the upbringing of the child they have\nbeen discarded or supjDressed in deference to the require-\nments of the social environment, the moral and cultural\ntradition into which he was born. Their further appear-\nance in consciousness would be accompanied by pain\nrather than by pleasure, so a censorship is set up by the\npreconscious which ensures that these unacceptable wishes\nshall not penetrate into consciousness. Yet they continue\nto exist in the unconscious and, according to Freud,\nform the very foundation of our being. \" These uncon-\nscious wishes establish for all subsequent psychic efforts a\ncompulsion to which they have to submit and which\nthey must strive if possible to divert from its course\nand direct to higher aims.\" 1\nAny hypothesis put forward in explanation of subliminal\nmental activity ought to take account of the evidence\nwhich supports the conception of co-conscipusness. Some\nwriters believe the fact of consciousness to be so well\nattested in those activities which have been called co-\nconscious, that no hypothesis of unconsciousness can ever\nentirely cover them. The occurrence of co-consciousness\nmay not be really incompatible with any of the funda-\nmental conclusions at which Freud has arrived as to the\nstructure and functioning of the mind. But as a matter\nof fact Freud categorically denies that co-consciousness\never occurs. In reference to the hypothesis of dissociation\nand co-consciousness he says : \"I venture to urge against\nthis theory that it is a gratuitous assumption, based on\nthe abuse of the word '\nconscious.' We have no right\nto extend the meaning of this word so far as to make\nit include a consciousness of which its owner himself\n1\nInterpretation of Dreams, p. 479\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 145\nis not aware. . . . The cases described, as splitting of\nconsciousness, like Dr. Azam's, might better be denoted\nas shifting of consckrasness,\u2014that function\u2014or whatever it\nbe-\u2014oscillating between two different psychical complexes\nwhich become conscious and unconscious in alternation.\" 1\nThus we see that Freud feels compelled to deny the\noccurrence of co-consciousness, not only in hysteria and\nin post-hypnotic phenomena, but even in those cases\nof double or multiple personality in which its occurrence\nseems to be most clearly attested. For the explanation\nhe proposes in Azam's case is only applicable to the\nsimply alternating type of multiple personality and does\nnot help us at all to understand those of the co-conscious\ntype in which two different psychical complexes give\nevidence of being simultaneously conscious.\nIt is when we examine Freud's view of the uncon-\nscious as containing nothing but wishes that we meet\nwith a notion which begins to render intelligible Jung's\ndescription of \" Psychology of the Unconscious \" as \"A\nStudy of the Transformations and Symbolisms of the\nLibido.\"\nAt the beginning of his psychoanalytic work Jung\naccepted, or appeared to accept, all the main formu-\nlations of Freud in regard to the content and mechanism\nof unconscious functions. The unconscious wishes which\nformed the core of all unconscious psychic formations\nwere maintained by Freud to be of the nature of sexual\ndesires and longings. To indicate these desires and\nlongings he proposed to use the term Libido. Jung in\nhis later work has used this term in a much wider sense,\nthe understanding of which will be best attained by\nexamining the history of the use of the term libido in\npsychoanalytic writings.\nUnlike \"the unconscious\" the word \"libido\" was\npractically unknown as a technical term in psychology\nuntil Freud introduced it. It was, of course, frequently\nused in medical and medico-legal works where it had\nthe ordinarily accepted meaning of libido sexualis,\u2014with,\n1\nProceedings S.P.R. Vol. XXVI. p. 315.\n\f146 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nhowever, the implication of its English derivative, libidi-\nnous\u2014inordinate desire or lust. In the opening words\nof his Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex\nFreud defines his use of the term. He says :\n\" The\nfact of sexual need in man and animal is expressed in\nbiology by the assumption of a '\nsexual impulse.'\n\"\nThis impulse is made analogous to the impulse of\ntaking nourishment and to hunger. The sexual expres-\nsion corresponding to hunger not being found colloquially\nscience uses the expression \" libido.\" The use of the\nterm was thus clearly assigned and restricted to \" the\nsexual,\" and the chief ground of the criticism which\narose on every side respecting Freud's views is to be\nfound in the extended connotation which he appeared to\ngive to the word sexual. For it seemed plain, and indeed\nhe himself admitted, that he was using this word in a\nsense different in some ways from that in which it is\nordinarily used. The fact that \" infantile sexuality\n\"\nand the disturbance of its development are all important\nin his theory of the neuroses, is in itself sufficient to\nshow that he has departed from ordinary usage. For\nin the popular conception sexuality is never ascribed to\ninfancy.\nThe extent to which he departs from ordinary usage\nis perhaps best illustrated by reference to bis inclusion\nof \" thumb-sucking \" among the manifestations of infantile\nsexuality. And reference is here made to this, not for\nthe purpose of affirming or denying its legitimacy, but with\na view to understanding what is implied when the term\nlibido is used in Freudian writings, and thereby getting\na clearer notion of the innovations introduced by Jung.\nIn calling sexual such pleasure -giving activities as\nthumb-sucking it would at first sight seem as if Freud\nimplied that all pleasure is at root sexual in character.\nThis implication is accepted by Dr. Beatrice Hinkle in\nher excellent introduction to Jung's Psychology of the\nUnconscious, where she says Freud \" apparently identifies\nthe pleasure principle and the sexual instinct and con-\nsiders that the former is primarily rooted in the latter.\" l\ni\nPsychology of the Unconscious, p. xxii.\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 147\nFreud asserts, however, that pleasure to be called\nsexual must be pleasure of a definite and perhaps peculiar\nquality. Pleasure of this peculiar quality may be obtained\nfrom various regions of the body, and these regions he\ncalls erogenous zones. The erogenous quality adheres\nchiefly to definite regions of the skin or mucous mem-\nbrane, but any region may assume the function of an\nerogenous zone. He is indeed inclined to attribute the\n\" quality of erogenity \" to all parts of the body and\ninner organs. It is because he believes this peculiar\nquality of pleasure is obtained by the child in thumb-\nsucking that he sees in this habit an instance of infantile\nsexuality.\nThe term libido as used by Freud would thus express\nat least the craving for this peculiar quality of pleasure,\na craving which exists and is capable of satisfaction from\ninfancy to old age. This craving would appear, in the\nultimate analysis, to be the driving force behind all\nmanifestations of sexual activity whether infantile or\nadult, and therefore of all those activities of our moral\nnature whose rise and development may be traced to\na sexual source. This is the real Freudian libido, and\nwhen we find, as he himself has explicitly declared, that\nFreud's use of the word sexual includes every mani-\nfestation of altruistic love and endeavour, it is well to\nremember the egoistic and hedonistic source from which,\nin his view, all such strivings spring.\nIn the child the sexual impulse, according to Freud,\nis complex. It is made up of many components which\nhave different sources, and it has no connection with the\nfunction of reproduction. In the course of normal\ndevelopment its subservience to this later function is\nattained, and in the process many of the original infantile\ncomponents undergo energetic repression under the influ-\nence of mental forces like shame and disgust which\narise in the course of moral and cultural education. The\noverstrong excitation of any of these components in child-\nhood leads to a fixation which forms a weak spot in the\npsycho-sexual make-up of the adult, and if the libido\nis denied its normal outlet it turns and flows backwards,\n\f148 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nand in its \" regression \" reawakens the repressed impulse\ncomponents still existing in the unconscious. These,\nowing to the repression, cannot appear in consciousness,\nbut they find surrogate satisfactions in the production\nof neurotic symptoms. It is in this sense that Freud\nmaintains that neurotic symptoms derive their energy\nfrom the sexual life. They are substitute manifestations\nof the infantile sexual activities of the patient.\nThe regressive flow of the libido entails a withdrawal\nof libido from application in the \" real \" world and its\nutilisation in a world of phantasy. The function of\n\" adaptation to reality \" is thereby narrowed and the\nwaiit of adaptation evinced by psychoneurotic patients\ncorresponds exactly to the amount of libido withdrawn\nfrom application in the real world. That part of the\nadaptation to reality which is lacking in the psycho-\nneurotic is a part that is normally maintained by affluxes\nof libido, and the libido withdrawn from reality in these\npatients is libido sexualis as defined by Freud.\nJung admits the correctness of this view in so far as\nit is applied to the psychoneuroses of which hysteria\nmay be taken as the type ; but he thinks Freud's theory\nof the libido is not applicable to the true psychoses such\nas dementia precox or paranoia. For in these mental\ndisorders the failure of adaptation to reality goes far\nbeyond what can be accounted for by the withdrawal of\n\" libidinous affluxes \" alone. If we are to apply the\nlibido theory in explanation of the psychology of dementia\nprecox, we must either understand adaptation to reality\nas a whole to be a function of sexuality, or we must\nextend the meaning of the term libido so as to include\nunder it not only libido sexualis but also \" objective\ninterest in general.\"'\nThe latter course is that which Jung has followed.\nInstead of starting from the empirical standpoint of\nFreud, who \" accepts the multiplicity of instincts among\nwhich is the sexual instinct as a special phenomenon,\"\nJung approaches the question from the genetic stand-\npoint, and regards the multiplicity of instincts as issuing\nfrom a relative unity which he terms the primal libido.\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 149\nHe postulates \" a continuous life impulse, a will to live,\nwhich will attain the creation of the whole species through\nthe preservation of the individual.\"\nIn the stage of childhood, Jung says, the libido is\nalmost wholly occupied in the instinct of nutrition. With\nthe development of the body new spheres of application\nfor the libido are successively opened up. The last and\nmost important sphere of application is sexuality. In\nphylogeny this transformation of the primal libido presents\nitself as an energy of growth which forces the individual\ntowards division, budding, etc.\u2014as an impulse of pro-\ncreation. Further transformations of the primal sexual\nlibido so arising occur when, with the growing complexity\nof life conditions, part of the energy originally devoted\nto the production of the reproductive elements become\ndeflected into other channels so as to subserve \" the\nsecondary functions of allurement and protection of the\nyoung.\" By such transformations Jung claims that the libido\nso deflected becomes desexualised, and he thus hopes\nto escape the unwelcome conclusion that the \" function of\nreality \" is phylogenetically preponderatingly of sexual\norigin. Yet he says, \" It can be a surprise only to those\nto whom the history of evolution is unknown to find\nhow few things there really are in human life which\ncannot be reduced in the last analysis to the instinct\nof procreation. It includes very nearly everything, I\nthink, which is beloved and dear to us.\" 1\nIt is at first sight difficult to see what Jung gains\nby desexualising libido which in the last analysis is shown\nto be of sexual origin. Of more significance would have\nbeen his extension of the term libido to that part of the\nlife impulse which does not follow the path of sexual\nlibido but remains at the nutritional plane, if such\nextension of the application of the term proved to be\nuseful in the elucidation of the pathogenesis of the\npsychoses. But this he does not appear to claim. What\nhe does claim is that his conception of the part played\nin the function of reality by the primal sexual libido\nthat has become desexualised in the course of phylogeny\n1\nPsychology of the Unconscious, p. 145.\n\f150 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\n\" will prove of especial advantage in the important field\nof the introversion psychoses.\" In these he maintains\nthat \" reality is deprived, not merely of an immediate\n(individual) amount of libido, but also of an already\ndifferentiated or desexualised quantity of libido, which,\namong normal people, has belonged to the function of\nreality ever since prehistoric times.\" 1\nThus although Jung wishes to restrict the use of the\nword sexual to the \" immediate sexual,\" and declines to\ncall sexual those functions and activities of sexual origin\nwhich have become desexualised, it is impressive to find,\non his own showing, that in its ultimate analysis the\nlibido which is misapplied both in the neuroses and in\nthe psychoses is derived from that primal sexual libido\nwhich phylogenetically arises as an \" impulse of pro-\ncreation.\"\nIf Jung's purpose in formulating his theory of the\nlibido was, as Freudians declare, to escape the oppro-\nbrium of their sexual theories, it may perhaps be asserted\nthat he has increased the difficulties of his own exposi-\ntion and prejudiced the acceptance of his views by\ncommitting what many will consider an error of the same\nkind as was ascribed to Freud when he departed from\nordinary custom in his use of words. The originally\n\" sexual \" character of the \" impulse of procreation\n\"\nmay be too readily conceded because of the connection\nbetween sex and reproduction in the later stages of\nphylogeny. Such a concession is the more easily made\nbecause it falls into line with the usage of ordinary\nspeech. Yet it may legitimately be objected to on the\nground that reproduction by simple cell division or budding\nis phylogenetically prior to sex. Moreover, a somewhat\nsimilar concession was widely denied to Freud when he\nextended the use of the word sexual to activities that had\nno apparent connection with reproduction. In the one\ncase we are willing to call sexual, processes that have in\ntheir beginnings nothing to do with sex. In the other\nwe are unwilling to call sexual, impulses that in their\nbeginnings have nothing to do with reproduction.\n1\nPsychology of the Uncomciovs, p. 153.\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 151\nHad Jung been as enamoured of a sexual terminology\nas the Freudians appear to be, he might have applied\nthe libido theory to the psychoses by still further ex-\ntending the application of the word sexual, instead of\nby extending the meaning of the word libido so as to\nmake it synonymous with the primitive life impulse.\nHere as elsewhere in his recent work Jung appears to\nshirk the consecmences of his own analyses.\nThe transformations of the libido which Jung holds to\nbe the true subject-matter of the psychology of the\nunconscious are those deflections of the sexual libido from\nthe sexual territory into associated functions or analogous\nactivities which have occurred in the past history of the\nrace. He gives many instances in which such a deflec-\ntion has taken place and he traces the history of the\nsymbolism resulting therefrom in the cults and super-\nstitions of ancient peoples and in the myths and religions\nof more modem times. He is obviously, however, some-\nwhat at a loss to account for the origin of these deflec-\ntions of the libido. Why should primitive man allow his\nsexual libido to be turned away from its natural destina-\ntion, and employ itself so strenuously in substitution\nactions such as, for example, fire production or the\ncultivation of the earth ?\nIn his work on the Transformations of the Libido Jung\nexpresses his belief that primitive man was compelled\nto such sublimations of his libido by an internal resistance\nagainst sexuality. He does not consider that it was due\nto any outer opposition or to any real obstacle, but that\nit was due to an internal resistance based on an original\ndivision of the will.\nIn his later studies he makes more explicit the im-\nplications of this doctrine. He holds, with the best\nanthropological authorities, that man was from the be-\nginning a social animal and that altruism is necessarily,\ntherefore, as innate and as primordial as egoism in the\nsoul. The beginnings of sexual morality shown in the\nprehistoric deflections of the libido to other aims, were\nimposed upon man by his own nature. \" It should,\n\f152 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PART\nindeed,\" he says, \" never be forgotten\u2014and the Freudian\nSchool needs this reminder-\u2014that morality was not\nbrought down upon tables of stone from Sinai and forced\nupon the people, but that morality is a function of the\nhuman soul, which is as old as humanity itself. Morality\nis not inculcated from without. Man has it primarily\nwithin himself\u2014not the law indeed, but the essence of\nmorals.\" 1\nIn this quotation we find some indication of\nwhat appears to be a profound opposition between Jung\nand Freud in their outlook upon human nature. It may\nbe compared with the opposition which once existed\nbetween two of the great heresies of the Church\u2014the\nPelagians declaring that man is innately good, the Mani-\nchaeans insisting that he is innately evil.\nIn his work on the Psychology of the Unconscious\nJung approaches the subject of the symbolisms of the\nlibido in a somewhat novel way. He thinks that at the\npresent time there is need for the psychoanalyst to\nbroaden the analysis of individual psychologic problems\nby a comparative study of historical material relating to\nthem. Much work has been already done by the applica-\ntion of psychoanalytic knowledge to historical problems,\nand he now desires to apply the insight so obtained to\nthe interpretation of individual phantasies of purely un-\nconscious origin. He finds the material for his investi-\ngation in an article entitled \" Q.uelques faits d'imagination\ncreatrice subconsciente,\" contributed to Archives de Psy-\nchologie (1906, Vol. V.) by an American lady, Miss Frank\nMiller.\nIt is impossible here to indicate even in the barest\noutline the course which his investigations take. All that\nis possible is to give to the reader just a hint of the\ntopics discussed, and, by means of a few quotations, of\nthe kind of conclusions he is invited to accept.\nMiss Miller when on a sea-voyage was one night\ngreatly impressed by the singing of one of the Italian\nofficers. She afterwards had a dream at the end of which\nshe had a vision of a poem which she wrote down as\nsoon as she awoke. The poem was a Hymn of Creation\n1\nAnalytical Psychology, 2nd edit. p. 379.\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 153\nMiss Miller, in her commentary on the poem gives some\nof the associations necessary for the analysis which Jung\nundertakes. Among these may be found\u2014The Singer\n\u2014\nthe Morning Stars-\u2014the God of Tone\u2014The Creator\u2014The\nGod of Light and of Love\u2014a much honoured ecclesiastic\nwho had puzzled her in her youth by his references to\nthe Gift of Love (don d'amour).\nA quotation from Jung may indicate the line of investi-\ngation he follows and the kind of interpretation he gives.\n\" Miss Miller's problem at this age was the common human\nproblem : How am I to be creative ? Nature knows but\none answer to that : Through the child (don d'amour !).\nBut how is the child attained ? Here the terrifying\nproblem emerges, which, as our analytic experience shows,\nis connected with the father, where it cannot be solved ;\nbecause the original sin of incest weighs heavily for all\ntime upon the human race. The strong and natural love\nwhich binds the child to the father, turns away in those\nyears during which the humanity of the father woidd be\nall too plainly recognised, to the higher forms of the\nfather, the '\nFathers '\nof the Church, and to the Father God,\nvisibly represented by them, and in that there lies still\nless possibility of solving the problem. However, mythology\nis not lacking in consolations.\" 1\nAt a later date Miss Miller composed another poem\ncalled \"The Moth to the Sun.\" At the end of his\nexamination of the material supplied by this poem Jung\nsays :\n\" Under the symbol of '\nmoth and sun ' we have\ndug down into the historic depths of the soul, and in\ndoing this we have uncovered an old buried idol, the\nyouthful, beautiful, fire-encircled and halo-crowned sun-\nhero, who, forever unattainable to the mortal, wanders\nupon the earth, causing night to follow day ;\nwinter,\nsummer ; death, life ; and who returns again in rejuve-\nnated splendour and gives light to new generations. The\nlonging of the dreamer concealed behind the moth stands\nfor him.\" 2\nIn the third and last creation of Miss MiUer we meet with\nthe personification of the libido in the form of the hero.\n1\nPsychology of the Unconscious, pp. 62-63. 2\nIbid. pp. 115, 116.\n\f154 T.

The course of the invincible sun has\nsupplied the mystery of human life with beautiful and\nimperishable symbols ; it became a comforting fulfilment\nof all the yearning for immortality, of all desire of mortals\nfor eternal life. Man leaves the mother, the source of\nlibido, and is driven by the eternal thirst to find her\nagain, and to drink renewal from her ; thus he completes\nhis cycle, and returns again into the mother's womb.\" 1\nIt is by thus laying bare the mythological foundation of\nthe infantile incest phantasy that Jung seeks to break\naway from the Freudian interpretation and to regard\nthis phantasy not as a true sexual inclination towards\nthe parents but as \"a regressive product of the revival\nof the archaic modes of function, outweighing actuality.\" 2\nThe symbolisms of \" the hero,\" of the \" mother and of\nrebirth,\" of \"the dual mother role\" and of \"the sacrifice,\"\ngive Jung the opportunity to digress into discussion of\na great variety of topics ranging over the whole field of\nmythology and religion, and only an expert in these\nmatters is qualified to appraise the value of his con-\nclusions.

It is due to the reader\nthat a book of this character should have been provided\nwith a concise synopsis of the argument and a much\nfuller index.\nIn accordance with the biological trend of thought\nwhich led him to trace back the libido to a primordial\nlife-impulse, Jung postulates in the unconscious not only\nthe traces of human experience, both individual and\nracial, but also of that of our prehuman ancestors. Chief\nstress, is, however, laid on that part of the unconscious\n1\nPsychology of the Unconscious, pp. 231, 427. * Ibid. p. 463.\n\fxxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 155\nwhich is a heritage from racial experience ;\nand, indeed,\nit is of that part alone that he thinks it justifiable to\nspeak as being suitable subject matter of a scientific\npsychology. For the individual unconscious is in every\ninstance something unique and incomparable.\nHe believes that a man's mind may be regarded as\ncontaining not only the traces of his own individual\nexperience, but also, in a condensed or epitomised form,\ntraces of the experience of the whole race. This applies\nto modes of mental functioning as well as to the con-\ntents of the mind. The thinking of prehistoric man he\nbelieves to have been predominantly a thinking in images\n\u2014a dream or phantasy thinking, while directed thinking\n\u2014thinking in words, is a modern acquisition. Our dreams\nand the phantasy thinking of children and day-dreamers\nare thus a sort of re-echo of archaic mental process.\nSimilarly the phantasy formations which psychoanalysis\nhas revealed in the unconscious are identical in character\nwith the conscious thinking of prehistoric man. So also\nin regard to the content of the unconscious ; the symbols\nof the dream and of the unconscious phantasy show that\nman has retained a condensation of the psychic history\nof his development.\nJung therefore divides the materials of the unconscious\ninto personal and impersonal or collective contents. The\npersonal contents are those that are attributable to\npersonal experiences\u2014reminiscences of tli9 life-history of\nthe individual. The impersonal or collective contents are\nthose primordial images-\u2014or at least the inherited poten-\ntialities of such images\u2014which are common to the whole\nrace. The phantasies arising from this region of the\nunconscious have no basis in personal reminiscence.\nNow Jung would seem to teach that all the content\nof the impersonal unconscious is derived from transfor-\nmations of the primal sexual libido, \u2014transformations in\nwhich libido became desexualised by being taken away\nfrom its proper object and applied to other objects \" by\nmeans of shifting to an analogy.\" All the sexual symbols\non which he descants throughoiit his Psychology of the\nUnconscious with so much learning and ingenuity are\n\f156 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nnothing but the phantasy correlates which primitive man\nhad substituted for the original achievements of the sexual\nlibido. Moreover such diversions of the libido are still\ntaking place. \" Where this operation succeeds without\ninjury to the adaptation of the individual it is called\nsublimation. Where the attempt does not succeed it is\ncalled repression.\"\nThe transformations of the libido represented iu the\nimpersonal unconscious are thus the sublimations of \u2022\nour\nprehistoric ancestors by which libido became freed from\nthe immediate sexual and became applied to an ever\nincreasing range of objects, thereby assisting the dis-\ncovery of and the adaptation to an ever-widening en-\nvironment. In this way arose the rich sexual symbolism\nwhich pervades mythology and dream. The compulsion\ntowards transformation removed a certain amount of\nlibido from the real sexual activity and created a symbolic\nand practically valid substitute for what was lost.\nTo this phantastic analogy formation Jung ascribes a\ngreat role in the mental and moral development of man.\n\"It is a question,\" he says, \" whether the human con-\nsciousness has not been brought to its present state\nentirely or in great part in this manner. ... It is easy\nto believe that the carry over of the libido to a phan-\ntastic correlate has led primitive man to a number of\nthe most important discoveries.\" 1\nWe thus see that Jung has introduced into the con-\nception of the unconscious modifications as far-reaching\nas those which he advocates in regard to the use of the\nterms sex and libido. As we have seen he extends the\napplication of the word sexual so as to make it co-\nextensive with the impulse of procreation and refuses to\ncall sexual all that has no direct relation to procreation\nand all that has no longer, though it may once have\nhad, such a relation. He takes away from the word\nlibido the specific character which it has possessed since\nclassical times and uses it as a generic term to signify\nthe psychic energy that is common to every form of\nmental activity. Lastly, he includes within the un-\n1\nPsychology of the Unconscious, p. 156.\n\fxxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 157\nconscious not only all that we formerly understood by\nthe subliminal or the subconscious, not only the Uncon-\nscious of Freud, originating by repression in the course\nof the individual life, but also a vast domain inherited\nby each one of us from the collective experience of the\nrace.\nIt would seem as if Jung has wandered far from the\noriginal standpoint of psychoanalysis, and there is some\njustification for the protest of Freud that he has no\nlonger any right to describe either his theories or his\npractice under that name. There is no conception more\nfundamental to the psychoanalytic psychology originated\nand developed by Freud than the conception of \" Repres-\nsion.\" By repression alone is the existence and nature\nof the unconscious of Freud explained, and the overcoming\nof the resistances is the one aim of his psychoanalytic\ntherapy.\nBut Jung no longer speaks much of the repression.\nTrue, he does occasionally still appear to do it lip-\nservice, but the rejiression he has in mind seems to have\na totally different nature and a different origin. Here,\nagain, as in the case of the words sexual, libido, and\nthe unconscious, he continues to use a term which has\nacquired a very specific meaning in psychoanalytic writings\nbut has so altered its applications that it becomes practi-\ncally a different word.\nIn Freudian psychology the very existence of the un-\nconscious was explained by repression. Freud's theory\nof the neuroses was built upon this conception. The\nneurosis was the product of an unconscious conflict\nbetween the moral nature and the infantile wish-tendencies\nrepressed in the unconscious. The aim of psychoanalysis\nwas the overcoming of the resistances, the freeing of the\nrepressed complexes, and the liberation of the energy\nattached to them so that it became available for higher\nends.\nJung gives us an entirely new view of the structure\nand functions of the unconscious, a new hypothesis of\npsychogenic disturbances, a new therapy and a new\ntherapeutic aim. The personal unconscious is not for\n\f158 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nhim the result of repression due to a conflict with the\nmoral consciousness but is merely a consequence of the\ntendency of every individual to develop one-sidedly in\nhis mental growth. In his adaptation to life one part\nof his potentialities is neglected in favour of the other,\nand the neglected part tends to sink into the unconscious.\nBy analogy with the opposite tendencies which he\nfinds to be characteristic of dementia precox and hysteria\nrespectively, he maintains that there are two great\npsychological types under which all men may be classed.\nIn one type\u2014the extravert, of which hysteria is the\nextreme example,\u2014there is a centrifugal tendency of the\nlibido ; in the other type\u2014the introvert, of which de-\nmentia precox is the extreme example,\u2014there is a centri-\npetal tendency of the libido. \" In the one type the\nfundamental function is feeling, and in the other it is\nthought. The one feels his way into the object, the other\nthinks about it. The one adapts himself to his surround-\nings by feeling, thinking coming later ; whilst the other\nadapts himself by means of thought, preceded by under-\nstanding.\" 1 \" Each type has one function that is specially\nwell developed, the introvert using his thought as the\nfunction of adaptation, thinking beforehand about how\nhe shall act ; whilst the extravert, on the contrary,\nfeels his way into the object by acting.\" 2\nIn the in-\ntrovert the potentialities of feeling tend to be unconscious\nto the extent that they are undeveloped in the conscious\nlife. In the extravert the potentialities of thought tend\nto be unconscious in a similar way.\nCorresponding to their divergence along these different\npaths of adaptation the values of the one type become\nmore and more opposed to those of the other, so that\nin the end they become totally incapable of understanding\neach other. This fundamental opposition between the two\ntypes is compared to that which William James detected\nbetween philosophers according as they belonged to his\n\" tough-minded \" or his \" tender-minded \" group.\nIt is on the basis of this hypothesis of psychological\ntypes that Jung has constructed his theory of the neuroses.\n1\nAnalytical Psychology, 2nd edit., p. 391. * Ibid. p. 402.\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 159\nHe still holds to mental conflict being the proximate\ncause of the outbreak of neurosis, but the conflict is no\nlonger the Freudian conflict between adult and infantile\nwish-tendencies, but a conflict between \" the adapted\nfunction and the co-function that is undifferentiated, and\nthat lies to a great extent in the unconscious ; there-\nfore in the case of the introvert, between thought and\nunconscious feeling, but in that of the extravert, between\nfeeling and unconscious thought.\" 1\nThus, for example,\n\" If a man who naturally adapts himself by thinking is\nfaced by a demand that cannot be met by thinking\nalone, but which requires differentiated feeling, the trau-\nmatic or pathogenic conflict breaks out. On the contrary,\nthe critical moment comes to the man who adapts by\nfeeling when he is faced by a problem requiring differ-\nentiated thought.\" 2\nJung no longer looks for the cause of the neurosis in\nthe past. He does not ask what infantile fixations have\noccurred in the course of psycho-sexual development,\nnor what particular infantile phantasies are utilising the\nlibido withdrawn from adaptation to reality. He looks\nfor the cause in the present. He asks, what is the\nnecessary task in the patient's life which he will not\nfulfil and from which he recoils. He now seems to make\nlight of the fact that the \" life-task \" before which the\nneurotic quails is invariably a task inseparable from his\nlove-life, and he no longer admits, what he once strongly\ntaught, that the infantile fixations provide the true\nexplanation why the fulfilment of that particular task\nis impossible. The dominating power of the impulses as\na causative factor of neurotic disturbances is now replaced\nby the conception of a \" psychic indolence \" to face life's\ndifficulties, which seems strangely at variance with the\nabounding \" will to live \" emphasised in the energic\ntheory of the libido.\nJung's therapeutic practice in its early stages would\nseem to differ very little from that of Freud. He still\nfinds it necessary to trace back by analysis the phantasy\nproducts of the neurosis to their sources in infantile\n1\nIbid. p. 405. 2\nIbid. p. 405.\n\f160 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nsexuality,\u2014not because they are the causes of the neurosis\nbut because the energy which the patient needs for\nadaptation is attached to them and is wastefully employed\nin their production. But he no longer regards these\nsexual phantasies literally. He acknowledges the universal\nexistence of the \" CEdipus complex \" though he disbelieves\nin its \" fixation \" as a cause of the neurosis, but be sees\nin the incest wish no real sexual inclination towards the\nparents but merely a regressive revival of archaic modes\nof thought. The symbolism of the neurotic phantasy and\nof the dream is the only way of thinking open to the\nunconscious, and the unconscious thought of the neurotic\nis concerned with the same problem as that which proved\ntoo hard for his conscious thought, namely, the problem\nof adaptation, the problem of the life-task. The phantasy\nsymbolism manifested in the symptoms is an unconscious\nattempt at adaptation\u2014an attempt that has failed. The\nsymbolism of the dream, rightly interpreted, may indicate\nthe line along which adaptation maj succeed.\nHolding such views regarding the causation of neurotic\ndisturbances and the nature and significance of the un-\nconscious phantasies and the symbolism they employ,\nJung is constrained to modify both his therapeutic aim\nand his therapeutic method. His therapeutic aim is no\nlonger the overcoming of the resistances, for the uncon-\nscious he is interrogating is not primarily the product of\nrepression. His method is no longer purely analytic or\nreductive, but is supplemented by measures which he\nregards as synthetic or constructive. He is no longer\nsatisfied by the freeing of the libido which has regressed\ninto the unconscious, but he seeks to help the patient\nto find the \" life-line \" along which his future develop-\nment may most satisfactorily proceed.\nThe need of supplementing the analytic work by a\nconstructive synthesis seems to have been impressed upon\nJung by considerations very similar to those which were\nwidely expressed in the early criticisms of Freud's work.\nWhat good purpose can be served, it was asked, by\nstirring up the repressed tendencies which psychoanalysis\nreveals ? So now we find Jung asserting that a merely\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 161\nreductive analysis succeeds only in reinforcing the primi-\ntive trends of a personality, and implying that the patient,\nsince he cannot obey the fundamental and primitive\nimpulses of his nature thus laid bare, can do nothing\nbut sink into a state of resignation and hopelessness.\nIt is difficult to understand how such an implication\ncan be made by Jung after so many years of presumably\nsuccessful analytic practice upon Freudian lines. If it\nbe true, as he now maintains, that the sublimation of\nthe energies liberated by the analysis is possible only in\nexceptional cases, and that the disposable energy cannot be\nconsciously directed to a suitable object but will sink\nback into the unconscious, we may well ask : Was it the\ncure of exceptional cases only that upheld the enthusiasm\nof the pioneers of psychoanalysis ? Did they not lead us\nto suppose rather that it was only in exceptional cases\nthat the method failed ? Do the Freudian analysts of\nto-day cure only exceptional cases ? Did Jung himself\ncure only exceptional cases before he discovered the\n\" transcendental function \" of his synthetic or constructive\nmethod ?\nThe absence of statistical records of success and failure\nin psychoanalytic treatment may be a not undeserved\nreproach when it is made by one who is outside the\npsychoanalytic movement ; but when we find a psycho-\nanalyst justifying his introduction of a new method by\nimplying that the old method was well known by its\nexponents-\u2014though they did not say so\u2014to be of use\nonly in exceptional cases, we are apt to feel that we have\nnot been fairly dealt with and become suspicious that the\nnew method also may be similarly restricted in its appli-\ncation.\nFreud dealt quite explicitly with the fate of the wishes\nwhich become free by psychoanalysis, and the means by\nwhich they are made harmless, and may become useful,\nfor the life of the individual. In the first place he claimed\nthat the repression might be supplanted by a condem-\nnation carried through with the best means at one's\ndisposal. In the maturity and strength of adult life the\npatient may conquer without injury to himself those\n\f162 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nimpulses which as a child he could only deal with by-\nrepression. A second possibility is that the unconscious\nimpulses revealed in the analysis may now follow the\npath of sublimation which in the case of undisturbed\ndevelopment they would have found earlier. A third\npossibility which should be kept in mind is that some\npart of the repressed wishes have a right to direct satis-\nfaction and ought to find it in life.\nJung would seem to minimise or deny the two former\npossibilities, and to imply that the only result of a merely\nreductive analysis is to liberate wish tendencies whose\ngratification is prevented by the stern necessities of life.\nHitherto it has been taught that the final stage of a\npsychoanalysis is the dissolution of the transference to\nthe analyst of all the infantile phantasies which have\nbeen projected on to him in the course of the analytic\nwork. When this had been accomplished satisfactorily\nthe patient was supposed to be ready and able to utilise\nthe full libido energy now at his disposal and to apply\nit in a new and more adequate adaptation to life. Now,\nhowever, Jung tells us that at this stage of the analysis\nthe process of freeing the patient from the grip of the\nunconscious is not more than half done. The libido\nfreed in the dissolution of the transference, in so far as\nthis takes the form of the projection of infantile phan-\ntasies derived from the personal unconscious, has open\nto it an easier path than the strenuous one of sub-\nlimation into ethical and social activity. \" It sinks down\ninto the depths of the unconscious, reviving what has\nbeen dormant there from immemorial ages.\" 1\nIf now\nthe analytic process be carried further, new phantasy\nformations are projected on to the analyst just as the\ninfantile phantasies were ; but he no longer appears in\nthe guise of father, or guardian, or any other form having\na basis in the personal reminiscence of the patient, but\nacquires the attributes of god or devil. The libido has\nseized upon the primordial images derived from the\nhistory of the race, which form the content of the im-\npersonal or collective unconscious, and by their projection\n1 Analytical Psychology, 2nd edit. p. 411.\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 163\non to the analyst a new and more dangerous phase of\ntransference is begun.\nThe method of analysis, the \" causal-reductive \" pro-\ncedure, which reduces the dream or phantasy to its\ncomponent reminiscences is obviously inappropriate here,\nas there are no personal reminiscences to which these\nphantasies can be reduced. To attempt to do so, Jung\nsays, is not only inappropriate but actually pernicious,\n\u2014\na fact that has been impressed on him by disagreeable\nexperiences.\nIt is at this point that the need arises for that con-\nstructive or synthetic interpretation of unconscious material\nwhich forms perhaps the most fundamental difference\nbetween the therapeutic methods of Freud and Jung.\nTheoretically this interpretation should not be necessary\nand should not be applied until all the phantasies based\nupon personal reminiscences have been subjected to the\nanalytic (reductive) procedure. There seems, however, to\nbe a tendency amongst Jung's disciples to apply the\nconstructive method from the very beginning of their\nanalytic treatment and to regard it as the most important\npart of their work. But although Jung admits that all\nphantasy thinking is open to constructive interpretation,\nhe himself is careful to insist on the need of analytic\nreduction in the earlier stages of therapeutic psycho-\nanalysis.\nThe essential features of the synthetic or constructive\nmethod may be illustrated by comparing the two ways\nof dealing with the symbols of dreams. Its fuller appli-\ncation in the \" transcendental function \" of coming to\nterms with the impersonal unconscious cannot be dealt\nwith here.\nIn their treatment of dream symbolism we find revealed\nsome of the fundamental differences between Freud and\nJung in their outlook upon human nature. These differ-\nences are implicit in the primary conceptions from which\nthey start out on their psychological quest, and account\nin great measure for the differences in the nature of the\ntreasures which they find. Freud sets out from the\n\f164 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nassumption that the driving force behind all mental\nactivity is the desire for pleasure and the avoidance of\npain. The gratification of desire is the primary aim of\nhumanity, and adaptation to the realities of life is a hard\nnecessity imposed from without. Jung sees the primal\nlibido as a will to live. The fulfilment of .a task\u2014the\nadaptation to life\u2014is the primary incentive. Pleasure\nappears in a secondary role as a reward for duty done.\nFreud's outlook may be compared to that of Adam\nbefore the fall-\u2014the pursuit of pleasure in a paradise\nof desire marred only by the interdict placed upon the\nfruit of the forbidden tree. Jung's outlook is rather\nthat of Adam after the expulsion from the garden, con-\nfronted with the task of adaptation if he would live.\nFor Freud the instigator of the dream is the uncon-\nscious wish that seeks gratification, and the function of\nthe symbol is so to distort this wish that its true nature\nis not realised in consciousness. For Jung the dream is\na continuation in the unconscious of the attempt to\nsolve the problems of adaptation that occupy our conscious\nthoughts during waking life. The occurrence of dream\nsymbolism is explained as a reversion during sleep to an\narchaic mode of thinking. The conscious purposive think-\ning of primitive man was a thinking in symbols, and in\nthe symbolism of dreams the original teleological function\nof this mode of thinking is retained. Thus for Jung the\ndream is no longer merely a veiled gratification of\nrepressed desires, but a continuation through the hours\nof sleep of that struggle for adaptation which is the\nuniversal and inescapable heritage of life.\nGreat stress is laid by Jung in his therapeutic work\non the teleological or prospective function of the dream.\nThe task of adaptation to life is so difficult that its\nfulfilment requires the energies of the whole man. Only\nby taking into consideration all aspects of the problem,\n\u2014\nnot only those which appeal to consciousness but also\nthose which have received only unconscious consideration\n\u2014is the most satisfactory solution attained. Hence in\nthe interpretation of dreams Jung looks to the unconscious\nfor guidance in his therapeutic task of helping his patients\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 165\nto overcome the difficulties of adaptation which have led\nto the development of their neuroses.\nJung does not tell us why he thinks the dream has\nthis prospective function. There is, it is true, a certain\namount of evidence to show that unconscious thought is\nsometimes directed towards definite aims, and that this\nsometimes results in happy solutions of problems that\nhave defied our conscious thought. But he does not\ninvoke this evidence in favour of his contention. More-\nover, although such perseverance of purpose through the\nhours of sleep may occur in persons who have excep-\ntional powers of sustained attention, or whose will to\nsucceed is not easily thwarted, it does not seem to accord\nwell with the type of character which has been brought\nto a neurosis through psychic indolence to grapple with\nthe difficulties of life. And this it must be remembered\nis Jung's explanation of the origin of neurotic maladies. It\nwould seem more in keeping with the hypothesis of psychic\nindolence as the cause of the neuroses that in sleep, when\nthe need for effort is abated, the mind should revert to less\nstrenuous forms of activity and secure the gratification in\nphantasy of infantile wishes as the Freudians maintain.\nBut Jung's way of regarding the significance of the\ndream content is consistent with his view of the com-\npensatory function of the unconscious. He teaches that\nthe capacity for making the most suitable adjustments to\nlife is present in the psyche as a whole ; what is missing\nfrom the conscious is to be found in the unconscious.\nIt is not that the unconscious attempt at adaptation is\nmore adequate by itself than the conscious one, but that\nonly by bringing the unconscious to the aid of the con-\nscious is the best possible solution of any of life's problems\nto be found. And the solution provided by the con-\nstructive interpretation of the dream need not be regarded\nas the result of thinking directed to this end during\nsleep, but is rather a revelation of the subliminal aspect\nof the reaction of the psyche as a whole to the immediate\ntask confronting it.\nAlthough Jung does not tell us why he supposes the\ndream to have this forward-looking function, he gives\n\f166 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nus two reasons why he thinks it necessary to impose this\ninterpretation upon all dreams which in analysis reveal\nthe fundamental thoughts and impulses of the unconscious\nto be infantile wishes, and to read into them a pro-\nspective import indicative of a definite line of future\ndevelopment. His first reason for supplementing the\nanalytic by a synthetic interpretation is that we cannot\nexhaust any psychological material by causal methods\nonly. We cannot get the meaning of any psychological\nphenomenon by analysing it into its causal antecedents.\nThe mind lives by aims as well, and \" what is plainly\ndirected towards a goal cannot be given an exclusively\ncausalistic explanation.\" 1\nBut the recognition of purpose in our conscious thinking,\n\u2014in the sense of aims directed towards the future\n\u2014\nwould not warrant the attribution of such purpose to\nour unconscious thought. To do so is to assume the\nconclusion which has to be proved. There may be other\ngrounds for maintaining that dreams are purposive, but\nif that be so we must not assume that the purpose of\nthe dream is the same as the purpose of our waking life.\nAny evidence which clearly shows that the dream has a\npurpose should also reveal what that purpose is. The\nchief danger in dream interpretation would just seem to\nbe that we may read into the dream the purpose we\nassume to be there.\nSuch at all events is the impression one gets from the\ndream interpretations of analysts belonging to different\npsychoanalytic schools. According as the analyst has\ncome under the influence of Vienna or of Zurich the same\ndream will be interpreted as showing the fulfilment of\nan unconscious wish or as indicating the attitude towards\nlife which the dreamer should adopt. And even in the\nreduction of the dream to a wish, the wish thus found\nis not always the same. Freud finds it to be a wish\nfor pleasure ; Adler finds it to be a wish for power. It\nis often asserted, however, that all the different interpre-\ntations may be right. It is claimed that the different\nparts of the dream may all be so \" over-determined\n\"\n1 Analytical Psychology, 2nd edit. p. x.\n\fixxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious mid Psychoanalysis. 167\nthat the dream as a whole has more than one meaning.\nThis may be true, but the fanciful nature of the inter-\npretations given in some records of dream analysis, and\nthe obvious imposition of the analyst's views in the\nunveiling of the symbolism and in the manipulation of\nthe dreamer's associations, may make the sceptical reader\nthink that the psychoanalytic study of the unconscious\nhas become the \" tumbling ground for whimsies \" against\nwhich we were warned by William James.\nAgainst no part of Freud's work is criticism so readily\naroused as against that which deals with the interpre-\ntation of dreams. The reason for this is obvious. One\nmay hesitate to express an opinion regarding the reduction\nof neurotic symptoms to infantile wish fulfilments, for\nnot every one is acquainted with neurotic symptoms. But\nevery one dreams and every one is at first inclined to\nresent as absurd and intolerable the Freudian interpre-\ntation of his own dreams. Some of the misunderstanding\nin regard to this matter may be obviated if two considera-\ntions are steadily kept in mind. The first is the dis-\ntinction between the manifest dream content\u2014the dream\nas remembered by the dreamer\u2014and the latent dream\nthoughts which contain the real meaning of the dream.\nThe second consideration is that there are two distinct\ntechnical methods employed in dream interpretation.\nNeither method by itself is sufficient for the full under-\nstanding of the dream. This is only possible, when it\nis possible, by the use of both.\nThe first method, and from one point of view the\nmore important for the purposes of psychoanalysis, is the\nobtaining of the free associations of the dreamer to the\nvarious parts of the dream. By this means the true\ndream thoughts related to the actual conflicts of the\nmoment are revealed. Thoughts of deep personal signifi-\ncance, of which no trace is to be found in the manifest\ndream content, are thus brought to light. When the asso-\nciations to all the different parts of the dream have been\nobtained, the ideas and memories so recalled are found\nto be related in such a way that they form a more or\nJess connected and intelligible whole. In this way a\n\f168 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PAET\nfirst approximation to the meaning of the dream may be\nobtained and a mass of material is provided for further\nanalysis. But it is only by interpreting the symbols\nwhich the dream-work so abundantly provides that the\ndeeper meaning is revealed, ana in this part of the work\nthe associations of the dreamer offer but little help.\nFreud believes that symbols are used predominantly\nfor the purpose of disguising unconscious sexual wishes,\nand he points out that dream symbols are widely found,\nhaving a similar function, in myths and folk-lore and in\nthe sayings and maxims of all peoples. According to\nJung the value to be attributed to the symbol depends\non the standpoint from which we regard it. From the\nstandpoint of \" causality,\" that is, tracing backwards the\nhistorical origin of the symbol, he admits its sexual\ncharacter. But from the standpoint of \" finality,\" that\nis, looking forward to the end or jmrpose of the dream,\nhe sees in the symbol an attempt to comprehend, by means\nof analogy, the solution of the problem with which the\ndreamer is confronted in his life. The use of symbols\nis merely the mode of expression used by the unconscious.\nSymbol formation was the means by which primitive man\nsucceeded in desexualising his libido, and the symbol\nreappears in the language of the dream devoid of its\nsexual significance.\nJung's way of regarding the symbol is part of his\nattitude towards the dream as a whole. He admits that\neverything in the dream has its causal or historic explana-\ntion, as everything that exists must have, but he main-\ntains that neither the dream nor any other psychological\nconstruction can be fully understood from the causal\nstandpoint only. \" Only on one side,\" he says, \" is the\nmind a Has Been, and as such subordinate to the causal\nprinciple. On the other side the mind is a Becoming\nthat can only be grasped synthetically or constructively.\n. . . On the one side it offers a picture of the precipitate\nof the past, and on the other side a picture of the\ngerminating knowledge of all that is to come, in so far as.\nthe psyche creates its own future.\" 1\n1\nAnalytical Psychology, '2nd edit. p. 341.\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 169\nHis acceptance of this point of view has its interest\nin that it impels him to declare that its adoption is\nopposed to scientific method. If the mind and its\nactivities cannot be explained on those principles of\ncausation which are alone applicable in other fields of\nscientific investigation, then the conclusions of psycho-\nlogical inquiry will be lacking in scientific validity accord-\ning to our present conceptions of science. He implies\nthat the future is not contained in the past and is not\ndeducible from it even if we were in possession of all\nthe facts ; and in admitting that the psyche in some\ndegree \" creates its own future \" he is apparently in full\nretreat from that rigid psychic determinism which was\noriginally the most fundamental postulate of the psycho-\nanalytic method. For creation is the bringing of some-\nthing new unto the universe and the opening of a door\nto contingencies which elude calculation.\nIn reviewing the first edition of Jung's Analytical\nPsychology 1\nI ventured to indicate the logical conclusions\nto be drawn from his few brief references to this matter.\nIn his preface to the second edition of this work he does\nme the honour of replying at some length to my remarks,\nand in the important new contributions to this volume\nhe makes frequent, more detailed, reference to the same topic.\nHe maintains that a psychological theory must adapt itself\nto the fact that, psychologically speaking, we are living and\nworking, day by day, according to the principle of directed\naim or purpose, as well as that of causality. He justifies\nhis desire to hold on to both points of view on the\nground that \" our theory of cognition does not need to\nremain on a pre-Kantian level. It is well known that Kant\nshowed very clearly that the mechanistic and the teleo-\nlogical view points are not constituent (objective) principles,\nin some degree qualities of the object, but that they are\npurely regulative (subjective) principles of thought, and as\nsuch they are not mutually inconsistent.\" 2\nPerhaps I owe it to Dr. Jung to make the confession\nthat in my criticism I was acting the part of devil's\n1\nProceedings S.P.N.

But I thought that\nwhat was implicit in his references deserved more ex-\nplicit statement from him, and I am pleased to find\nthat my remarks have been successful in bringing this\nabout.\nThe acceptance, however, of this point of view in regard\nto that part of the mind which we know by introspec-\ntion, and of the implications which it may carry with it,\ndoes not bind us to believe that the same point of view\nnecessarily holds good when the unconscious is in question.\nThe unconscious does not speak plainly, and its purpose,\nif it has one, is obscure. Our knowledge of its purpose\ncan only be obtained by interpretation of its cryptic\nutterances, and the truth of what we discover must be\nopen to doubt if, before beginning our investigation, we\nhave to assume both the presence of the purpose and\nthe validity of our interpretative methods. And this is\nwhat Jung, in his constructive inteipretation of the dream,\nappears to do. Yet here, as elsewhere, we may perhaps\njudge our conclusions to be true if we find that they\nwork.\nJung's second reason for supplementing the analytic\ninterpretation of the dream by a synthetic or constructive\none is that he considers it necessary in the interests of\nthe patient. Admitting that we reach very dissimilar\ninterpretations of the meaning of the dream according\nto the point of view adopted, he asks the question : Which\nis the better or the truer version ? His criterion of truth\nis here an essentially practical one. He considers it his\ntherapeutic duty to lay hold of any means that will\nenable him to train his patients effectually and to fit\nthem to live. And since he believes that a purely re-\nductive analysis merely helps to reinforce the primitive\ntrends of the patient's personality, and releases impulses\nwhich cannot be satisfied \" without gravely injuring him-\nself or his fellow-beings,\" Jung feels bound to seek out\nsome symbolic application of infantile trends, out of which\na philosophic or religious attitude towards life may be\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 171\nevolved that will help the patient to live up to the best\nthat is in him.\nIt would look as if Jung implied that his method must\nbe right and his version true because his motives are so\ngood. But the vital necessity, of which he speaks, to\nfind for his patient a way out of the bog into which\npsychoanalysis had led him, gives us no guarantee that\nthe road he points out is the right one or the best one.\nMoreover it seems impossible to reconcile Jung's latter-\nday contentions with the knowledge that he himself,\nas well as many others, have for years successfully used\nFreudian analysis without the need of supplementing it\nby any didactic methods. The alleged dangers of reductive\nanalysis on which Jung now lays so much stress have\nbeen explicitly denied by Freud. He says : \"In relation\nto this anxiety we must consider what our experiences\nhave taught us with certainty, that the somatic and\nmental power of a wish, if once its repression has not\nsucceeded, is incomparably stronger when it is unconscious\nthan when it is conscious, so that by being made con-\nscious it can only be weakened. The unconscious wish\ncannot be influenced, is free from all strivings in the\ncontrary direction, while the conscious is inhibited by\nthose wishes which are also conscious and which strive\nagainst it. The work of psychoanalysis accordingly pre-\nsents a better substitute, in the service of the highest\nand mos* valuable cultural strivings, for the repression\nwhich has failed.\" 1\nThe emphasis laid by Jung on the importance of his\nconstructive method may prove a real danger to the\nrising generation of analysts. They may be tempted to\nneglect the need for the thorough analysis which Jung\nhimself admits to be necessary, and to embark too\nprecipitately on the constructive course which they\nmay find ethically and aesthetically more attractive.\nThey may, by so doing, succeed in temporarily reinforcing\nthe repression which has failed, but they will have\nwandered far, both in attainment and intent, from the\ngoal of psychoanalysis.\n1\nAmerican Journal of Psychology, April, 1910, pp. 216-217.\n\f172 T. W. Mitchell 31.D. [part\nWe are still too near the psychoanalytic movement to\njudge truly of the place it may ultimately hold in the\nhistory of thought. More than most new departures psycho-\nanalysis has been open to attack,\u2014partly by the nature\nof the doctrines which it teaches and partly by the almost\ncynical indifference to the conventions shown by some\nof its exponents in their exposition of these doctrines.\nBut these give only superficial grounds for criticism or\ndisagreement. The claims of psychoanalysis are so im-\nportant and noteworthy, and have already so great a\nweight of evidence in their support, that no one who\nseeks the truth in any department of human life and\nthought can any longer afford to neglect the methods\nand conclusions of this new psychological discipline.\nThe topics discussed in the previous pages suggest at\nleast two points of view from which psychoanalysis may\nbe regarded. In the first place it may be looked at in\nthe light of its development as a therapeutic method in\nthe treatment of the neuroses and psychoses. In the\nsecond place it has a wider significance as a method\nof psychological investigation. Its therapeutic applications\nare justified by its success in conditions where all other\nmeans have failed, but the truth of its theoretic formu-\nlations can hardly be considered proved by its therapeutic\nusefulness alone. In the long history of man's efforts to\ngrapple with mental and bodily disease much that was\nunessential in the means adopted was often credited\nwith the cure. And so it may be with psychoanalysis.\nSome possibility of this kind is indeed obvious when we\nconsider that both Freud and Jung obtain therapeutic\nsuccess although holding such opposite views on matters\nwhose interpretation in a particular way was at one\ntime deemed essential in psychoanalytic theory and\npractice. Time alone and the labours of many workers\nwill in this as in former days sift the chaff from the\ngrain and make plain what is important and what is\nunimportant in psychoanalytic therapeutics.\nConsidered as a method of psychological investigation\nthe claims of psychoanalysis are more far-reaching than\nwhen it is regarded merely as a therapeutic method,\n\flxxv.] Psychology of the Unconscious and Psychoanalysis. 173\nand if they are substantiated or extended by future\nworkers it will have to be recognised that the intro-\nduction of psychoanalysis was the most important contri-\nbution of modern times to the mental and moral sciences.\nFor the application and pursuit of this psychological\nmethod bears fruit not only in the domain of purely\npsychological problems but also in every field of knowledge,\nfeeling and action. The claims of its supporters as to\nits bearings on philosophy, aesthetics, ethics and religion,\namount to little less than a claim to a new revelation\nof the meaning of life.\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART LXXVI\n1918.\nI.\nFRESH LIGHT ON THE \" ONE-HORSE DAWN \"\nEXPERIMENT.\nBY J. G. PlDDINGTON.\nKULTOl TO <y CUViyfl OVy] TOV~iri6vTO<i >)v\nuvSpcx; ciienrelv.\nSoph. O.T. 393-394.\nOn an unnamed date in April 1901, a few weeks after Mrs.\nVerrall had begun to write automatically, her husband, Dr.\nA. W. Verrall, decided to try the experiment of fixing his\nmind on certain words with a view to getting them reproduced\nin her script. He chose for the subject of this experiment\nin thought-transference three Greek words from the Orestes\nof Euripides : novoirwXov e? 'Aw (monopolon es Ao). 'E? 'Ato\nmeans \" to the Dawn \" ; but the word \/jlovottwKov has\nbeen variously interpreted. It has usually been derived\nfrom \/u>.6voi, \" one only,\" and 7rd>Ao?, which, though mean-\ning a \" foal,\" is often used in poetry for tWos (hippos),\na \" horse \" ; and so the ordinary rendering has been\n\" with one horse.\" Dr. Verrall, however, thought it\n\" may mean no more than \/ulopos, alone or solitary, the\nlatter part of the word, -71-00X05, being possibly con-\n\f176 J. G. Piddington. Tpart\ntm\nnected with -n-oAeoiuat, '\nto wander '\n\" (Proc. Vol. XX.\np. 157).\n1\nI draw attention thus early to this linguistic point not\nfrom any idle desire to interest my readers in an etymo-\nlogical problem for its own sake, but because it has a\nreal bearing on the subject. At the same time, it may\nnot be out of place to remind some members of our\nSociety, who are inclined to chafe at the frequency with\nwhich classical subjects are discussed in our Proceedings,\nthat the scripts of our automatists (two of them, by the\nway, classical scholars) are, so it is claimed, influenced by\ncommunicators to whom, or at any rate to some of whom,\nthe literatures of Greece and Rome made an absorbing\nappeal ; and that no one could have felt this appeal more\nkeenly than the originator of the novoirwKov e? 'Aw\nexperiment.\nWe have to deal, then, with an experiment initiated by\none classical scholar, which required a response from Mrs.\nVerrall, another classical scholar, and to which a response\nwas\u2014ostensibly, at least\u2014made, not by Mrs. Verrall, but\nby a group of classical scholars through her ;\nand, pardessus\nle marche, the subject selected for the experiment was a\nphrase from a classical author.\nIt would be strange indeed, if, in these circumstances, I\ncould refrain from eating of the Forbidden Fruit of\nclassics. But I will do nothing more dreadful than give\nthe meaning of some Greek and Latin words ; relate in\nbarest outline an episode in one Greek play, and tell\nsomething more of the story of another ; and quote trans-\nlations in good English of some passages from both plays.\nI have, moreover, been at pains throughout to make things\neasy for the non-classical reader, so that he may not be\nhandicapped by his ignorance of Greek and Latin.\nIn Proc. Vol. XX. pp. 156-167 Mrs. Verrall gave an\naccount of the \" One-Horse Dawn \" experiment , and dis-\ncussed how far it succeeded ; and in an Appendix (id. ib.\npp. 387-394) she reproduced such of her scripts, or such\nparts of them, as she thought have reference to the experi-\n^n p. 164 Mrs. Verrall speaks of \" lonely-wandering \" as \"the interpre-\ntation preferred by my husband.\"\n\flxxvi.] The \" One-Horse Dawn \" Experiment. 177\nment. I give in her own words the conclusions which she\nreached :\nNo one who reads the detailed account of the writing\nof August and September, 1901, can, I think, have any\ndoubt that there is a connexion between the persistent\nefforts of the script and the test that had been devised\nby my husband, (p. 165)\nAnd again :\nAs regards success, it will not I think be denied that\nthe script made an attempt at the problem\u2014a thing itself\nremarkable in the circumstances. Also it came near to\nwhat was set in sound and sense. The script is full, for\nthe time, of the ideas morning and east, named or sug-\ngested in various ways ; more than once occurs a transla-\ntion, or something very near it, of the original words\n\u2014\n'\ngoing towards the east,' '\nin the east to the daylight,'\nand so on. The language and words too are approached,\nthe middle word is correctly and repeatedly given ; it\nis indicated clearly that the e? is preceded by a compound\nof novo-, and it is suggested that the final word begins\nwith a and ends with o. (p. 166)\nAnd she ends her comments on the experiment thus :\n. . . Given the words selected by my husband it can,\nin my view, be shown that the script from Aug. 13 to\nSept. 20, 1901, bears unmistakeable evidence of a know-\nledge of their appearance and meaning. But had we not\nknown the words, they would have been irrecoverable from\nthe script, although a careful examination would have\nshown an effort to communicate something definite, and\nsomething intelligible to my husband. Under these cir-\ncumstances it is rash to count as rubbish all that is not\neasily understood. We should rather apply in other cases the\npatience and scrutiny which were in this case justified.\nGood advice this, and noteworthy as coming from an\nautomatist who was almost always ready to underrate,\nand often to disparage, the value of her own phenomena.\nIt is not, however, the \" rubbish \" to be found \" in\n\f178 J. G. Piddington. [part\nother cases,\" but the \" rubbish \" in this very One-Horse\nDawn case that I propose to scrutinise on this occasion ;\nand chiefly one particular deposit of \" rubbish.\"\nIn the group of scripts selected by Mrs. Verrall as\nrelating to her husband's experiment there are repeated\nallusions to a solitary old man in a white robe, carrying\na long stick in his hand and \" going towards the east.\"\nThe only explanations that Mrs. Verrall had to offer of\nthe many things said about this old man were that\nthey served to introduce the idea of the east, and the\nideas of solitariness and of wandering contained, according\nto Dr. Verrall's view, in the word (xovo-wtakov ; and that\nthe words \/j.ov6<tto\\o<; {monostolos) and \/xovo^itosvo^ (mono-\nchitdnos) applied to the old man represent attempts to\ngive the word \/jlovottwXov. Some of these explanations are,\nI think, sound, so far as they go. But in view of the\nfact that the references to the old man are frequent, and,\non the whole, clear and definite, it seems unsatisfactory\nto have to dismiss the poor old man as no better than\na cumbrous piece of mechanism : a mere lay figure clothed\nonly with words and epithets suggesting the sound\nor sense of ixovo-wushov eV 'Aw. Moreover, if this is really\nthe best that can be done with him, we have got to\nreconcile the relative unimportance of this lay figure with\na statement about him made in Mrs. Verrall's script of\nMarch 27, 1902 (Script R), which is to this effect :\nYour husband's thought was good but not complete.\nThe old man in white was the best part of it but I have\nnot been able to finish that, and now it has all gone\naway. Put it aside it will return some day.\nAppended are all the references in Mrs. Verrall's scripts\nto the old man in white, together with some other refer-\nences which do not at first sight appear to belong to the\nold man, but which nevertheless, or so I hope to show,\nreally do so. Against scripts or extracts from scripts not\nincluded by Mrs. Verrall in her account of the \" One-\nHorse Dawn \" case an asterisk is placed. The Greek\nand Latin of the scripts being often incorrect, translations\nare necessarily sometimes conjectural.

I assume that this day was not later than\nApril 10, the date of the script.\nA is clearly connected with B, O and T.\nI regard this script as containing the first of many allusions\nto the blind and exiled Oedipus wandering in the company\nof his daughters Antigone and Ismene.\nANTi(poi>>] (Antiphone) I take to be a mistake for 'Avriyowi\n(Antigone). Misled by the mistake, and yet aware that the\nname of a woman, and of a Greek woman, was wanted,\nthe automatist then wrote \"\/ecu EAey>\/ \" (and Helen) instead\nof \" and Ismene.\" We may, I think, see in N, in the\nwords \" not Helen but another and not Scotch \" {i.e. not\nHelen of Kirconnell) a retractiou of the meaningless EXew\/\nand an attempt to say who was meant.\n\" Vagatur in montibus \" may be reminiscent of a passage\nin the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles (11. 1449-1457)\nwhere Oedipus, having blinded himself on discovering the\nhorrible truth that he is guilty of parricide and incest,\npleads with Creon to cast him out of Thebes and to let\nhim hide his shame in the hill-country of Cithaeron.\n\" Degener \" may possibfy allude to the awful disgrace\nthat has overtaken Oedipus, who had boasted that how-\never lowly his birth he never should be shamed (id. ib.\n1076-1085).\n\" Nocru \" is nonsense; as is also \" flexilla,\" though by\nthe latter \"a gleam\" or \"nicker\" must be meant.\nScript B.\n\" Illam \" [acc. sing, fern.] ought to refer to oratio ; but\nthis can hardly be said to make sense, and I suspect that\nby \" illam \" Antigone or Ismene is meant.\nScript C.\n\" Sine apparatu \" reappears in P.\nScript M.\nWith \" superbiam pone\" cf. \"pone superbiam \" in P.\n\flxxvi.] The \" One-Horse Dawn \" Experiment. 187\nScripts C, D, E, H, M, N, O, P, Q, R, T, U and V.\nThese scripts, in my view, all contain references to Oedipus ;\nchiefly to Oedipus going to his death ; and always with one\nsingle exception\u2014but that a crucial one\u2014to Oedipus as he\nappears in the Oecl. Col.1 of Sophocles.\nIn Script H will be found the one case where the\nreference is not to Oedipus as represented in the Oed. Col. ;\nand it is there made by means of the word ixovocttoXos\n(tnonostolos). Mrs. Verrall translated \/j.ov6<tto\\o<; by \" single-\nvested,\" deriving the word evidently from \/xoVo?, \" one only,\"\nand <ttoX>\/, 2 \" raiment \" or a \" robe.\" But \/j.ov6o-to\\o? is\nnot found in this sense in classical authors, who use it in the\nsense of \" journeying alone \" : the derivation being from\nmoVo?, \" alone,\" and <tt6\\os, a \" journey.\"\nI think it strange that Mrs. Verrall, who, after she had\nbeen told the subject of her husband's experiment, was,\nas her account shows, on the lookout for phrases or\nwords meaning \" journeying alone \" as pointing to the word\n\/UOfoVcoAoj', should have given to \/aovoo-toXos a sense which,\nthough permissible, is not the accepted one, which has no\nauthority, and which fails to bring in the idea which she\nwas hoping to find. No doubt her mind was influenced\nby the word niovo-^lrcovog (monochitonos), which immediately\nfollows iulovoo-toXos, and which\u2014though incorrect in form\n\u2014\ncan only mean \" single-tunicked.\"\nIt was the word im-ouoa-roXog (monostolos) that put me\non the track of the Oedipus allusions. For reasons\nwhich are not material to the present discussion, I\nwas re -considering in November 1917, the group of\nearly M. V. Scripts relating to the One-Horse Dawn\ncase. In the course of doing so, I was pulled up short,\nso to speak, at the word \/uopocttoXo?. I did not exactly\nquestion Mrs. Verrall's translation of it as \" single-vested,\"\nbut I thought that before accepting it I would look out\nthe word in Liddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon. The\nLexicon gives first the meaning \" going alone,\" and refers\n1\nThe abbreviations Oed. Col. and O.C. stand for the Oedipus Coloneus of\nSophocles : Oed. Tyr. and O.T. for the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles.\n2\nTwice at least this word aroXri \u2014in the plural, however,\u2014is used in\nthe O.C. of the beggar's garb worn by Oedipus (11. 1357, 1597).\n\f188 J. G. Piddiugton. [part\nin illustration to a line in a poem of Lycophron's. It next\ngives the general meaning as \" alone, single,\" and quotes\nin illustration two lines from two plays of Euripides'. And\nthen it adds :\n\" cf. \/movo^wvos.'\" So I looked up (tovoTwvos\n(monozonos). This the Lexicon renders :\n\" girt up alone, i.e.\njourneying alone \" ; and adds :\n\" like iuovo^uhttos, oio^wvos.\"\nSo then I looked up olofyvos (oioznnos). The Lexicon\ndoes not translate oio^wvos, and merely says it is equi-\nvalent to novoXwvos ; but it gives one instance\u2014and one\nonly\u2014of its use, viz. \" Soph. O.T. 846.\" So I looked up\nthe reference, using Jebb's edition of the Oedipus Tyrannus\nfor the purpose, and found that oio^wvog is there applied\nby Oedipus to himself. The situation at this point in the\nplay is as follows :\n\u2014Teiresias, the blind seer, has denounced\nOedipus as the murderer of Laius, Oedipus' predecessor on\nthe throne of Thebes. Oedipus, who had slain Laius,\nJocasta's first husband, without knowing who he was, tells\nhis wife Jocasta of the charge brought by Teiresias against\nhim. Jocasta says the charge cannot be true, because an\noracle had foretold that Lai'us was to be slain by his son,\nand Lams' only son had been left as a babe of three days\nold to die by exposure on Mount Cithaeron ;\nand, more-\nover, Laius had been slain at a place where three roads\nmeet by a band of robbers, as she had learnt soon after\nthe event, from the sole survivor of Laius' attendants.\nOedipus, who had in his youth killed a man at a place\nwhere three roads meet, and who accordingly has begun to\nsuspect that he may have been the unwitting murderer of\nLaius, realises that, if the sole survivor's story is true,\nhis fears are groundless ; for when he, Oedipus, had killed\nhis man, he was quite alone. He, therefore, has the sole\nsurvivor sent for in order to cross-question him ; and\nmeanwhile he says to his wife Jocasta :\nThou wast saying that he [ the sole survivor] spoke of\nLaius as slain by robbers. If, then, he still speaks, as\nbefore, of several, I was not the slayer : a solitary man\ncould not be held the same with that band. But if he\nnames one lonely wayfarer [avop eV olofywov], then\nbeyond doubt this guilt leans to me. (Jebb's translation\nof Soph. O.T. 842-847.)\n\fLXXVI.] The \" One-Horse Dawn \" Experiment. 189\nWhen I read these lines I felt no more enlightenment\nthan the reader is probably feeling at this moment.\nLuckily my eye lighted upon Jebb's note on the word\noloi^wvov. This note\n\u2014\nwhich should be read with attention,,\nas my whole argument turns on it\u2014I transcribe in full.\nIt runs thus :\noloj>vov, journeying alone. The peculiarity of the idiom\nis that the second part of the compound is equivalent to a\nseparate epithet for the noun : i.e. olo^wvos, '\nwith solitary\ngirdle,' signifies, '\nalone, and girt up.' O.C. 717 twv\n\u20acKaToiJ.ir68wv N>\/jO?\/cW, not, '\nwith a hundred feet each,' but,\ncountless, and dancing : ib. 17 irvKvoirTepoi atjSoves, not,\nthickly-feathered [nightingales], but, many and winged : ib.\n1055 StaToXov? aSeXcpus, not, separately-journeying sisters,\nbut, two sisters, journeying : Ai. 390 Sirro-apyas \/3acri\\^?,\nnot, diversely-reigning kings, but, two reigning kings : Eur.\nAle. 905 Kopos \/movowai?, not, a youth with one child, but,\na youth, his only child : Phoen. 683 Siwvv\/uloi Seal, not,\ngoddesses with contrasted names, but, several goddesses,\neach of whom is invoked. So I understand Eur. Or. 1004\nfAOvoiruikov 'Aw, '\nEos who drives her steeds alone '\n(when\nmoon and stars have disappeared from the sky).\nWhen I read this note of Jebb's I began to see daylight,\nbecause, besides the fact of the word \/jlovoo-toXos having\nled me, via its equivalents \/j.ov6Xoovo<s and oio^Wo?, to a\nnote in which the meaning of the words fxovoirwXov 'Aw is\ndiscussed, previous study of scripts\u2014I mean of scripts\ngenerally, not only Mrs. Verrall's, but those of other auto-\nmatists\u2014had convinced me of the existence of an elaborate\ncross-correspondence based on a passage in Modern Painters,\nwhere Ruskin compares the forest wherein Dante, on\nentering the Earthly Paradise, listens to the voices of the\nbirds mingling with the wind, with the Grove of Colonus,\nhaunted by the feathered choir of nightingales (the\nTrvKvoTrTepoL a>]S6veg of Jebb's note), \" where the aged and\nblind Oedipus \" was \" brought to rest.\" (Modern Painters,\nPart IV. Ch. XIV. \u00a7\u00a733, 34, 35.)\nI was actually working at this cross-correspondence when\nI looked up fxov6<TTo\\o<; in the Lexicon ; and hence it was\n\f190 J. G. Piddington. [part\neasy enough for me to jump to the conjecture that the old\nman in white was the Oedipus of the Oedipus Coloneus.\nMoreover, the conjecture came readily to my mind for\nanother reason. More than two years previously I had\nmade a note on Script D to the effect that the old man\nin white with \" a long stick in one hand, and a small\nsquare box in the other \" might be Odysseus disguised as\nan old beggar-man with wallet and staff returning to his\nhome in Ithaca. 1\nFrom Odysseus thus disguised to Oedipus,\nthe old blind beggar with his wallet, who speaks of his\ntwo daughters as his staffs (O.C. 1109 ; and see also 846),\nthe transition is not difficult.\nBut before examining how far the references to the old\nman in white do suit Oedipus, I must go back to Jebb's\nnote on oio^wpop and discuss it in some detail.\nHe gives in all seven examples of compound adjectives\nof the same type as oio^wvoi : three from plays of Euri-\npides, four from plays of Sophocles. Of the three Euri-\npidean examples, all I need say is that the last one is\nour old friend imovoirwXov is 'Aw. Of the Sophoclean\nexamples, three out of the four are taken from the Oedipus\nColoneus ;\nand, as will be seen, with each example selected by\nJebb from the Oedipus Coloneus the One-Horse Dawn scripts\ncan be shown to have distinct points of contact. Thus :\n(1) irvKvoirrepoi aijSoi'e?. The Oedipus Coloneus opens by\nthe blind Oedipus asking his daughter Antigone to tell\nhim at what place they have arrived :\n01. TeKi'OP TvcpXoti yepoPTO?

This Chorus consists of\ntwo parts : the first devoted to the glorification of Colonus,\nthe second mainly to that of Attica and Athens, \" the\nlocal theme,\" says Jebb, being \" skilfully knitted to the\nnational theme.\" Even a careless reader could hardly, I\nthink, fail to notice one thread common to the two parts,\nand that is the word evi7riro<; {euippos). As Jebb says :\n\" The first word [of the Chorus] ev'nrircv strikes a note\n1\nNot only does Oedipus call himself ttXcip^tijs (wanderer), bub the\nChorus so speaks of him emphatically : n-Xavdra^, irXavaras tis o wpicrj3vs\n(O.C. 123-124).\n\f192 J.

A Greek beggar of the\nclassical period might, I suppose, have worn a white robe\nfaute de mieux, but a stage beggar so habited would have had\nto explain his unconventional attire to the audience. The\ncolour of Oedipus' garments is not mentioned in the play,\nthough their squalor is twice referred to, once with great\nemphasis (O.C. 1257-1260 and 1597).

Hitherto, through-\nout the play, Oedipus has been strongly characterised by\nthat timidity in movement, and that sense of physical\ndependence, which are normal accompaniments of blindness.\n(Cp. 21, 173 ff., 495 ft, 1206, etc.) Now, suddenly inspired\nby the Unseen Power which calls him, he becomes the\nguide of his guides. . . . Eager and unfaltering, the blind\nman beckons them on. And so he finally passes from the\neyes of the spectators.\nA contrast may be intended between \" the blind wayfarer\nnot without a prompter \" (i.e. a divine prompter) of\nScript 0, and \" the blind wayfarer without a helper\n\"\n(i.e. a human helper) of Script T.\nAlbipannosus in C and D Mrs. Verrall translated \" white\n-\ngarmented.\" The word does not occur in classical authors,\nnor, I think, in medieval Latin ; but it is correctly formed,\n\fLXXVI.] The \" One-Horse Dawn \" Experiment. 199\nand certainly means \" wearing a white panmis.\" Now,\npanmis usually means rags, and the adjective pannosus (except\nwhen it means \" wrinkled \") always means \" ragged \" or\n\" tattered.\" Accordingly I am inclined to question the\nrendering \" white-garmented,\" and I suspect that \" albi-\npannosus \" is a \" portmanteau \" word, which serves to\ndescribe both Oedipus in his beggar's garb and Oedipus in\nhis white burial garment. Something of the same kind of\nconfusion or admixture can be traced in the statement\nmade in Script D that the old man is \" going towards\nthe east,\" and in the statement made in Script 0 that\nthe \" caecus viator \" \"in orientem solem pedibus vagatur.\"\nBoth statements, I believe, are due to the automatist's\nhaving been confusedly aware of some sort of connexion\nbetween the old man and the blind wayfarer on the one\nhand and the idea of movement towards the east con-\ntained in the phrase\u2014not normally known to her, of\ncourse\n\u2014\n\/xovoirwXov e?

This, in\nspite of the fact that in E the automatist hedges\u2014as\nall automatists will do\u2014, and says the box may be a book,\nI have little hesitation in identifying as the beggar's\nwallet, which was squarish and made of leather. (Hence,\nperhaps, the vacillation between a box and a book.)\nOedipus' wallet is not specifically mentioned in the Oedipus\nColoneus ; but Jebb at least assigns him one, as witness\nhis note on O.C. 1262 :\n<f>op\u00abi is taken by some as '\nobtains by begging '\n; but\na conjecture to that effect would be hardly in place.\nObviously it means simply '\ncarries,'' and alludes to a\nwallet (-nrt'ipa) carried by Oed., for the reception of the\nairavLa-Ta Swp7jjULara (4) [\" scanty gifts \"]. This was a part\nof the conventional outfit for the wandering beggar ;\nso,\nwhen Athena turned Odysseus into that guise, she gave\nhim (TKrjTTTpov Kat aeiKea Tri]pi}vt\nI 7rvicva pwyu\\ei]V ev\narpoipo? ?iev aopn'\/p :\n'\na staff, and a mean, much-tattered\nwallet ; and therewith was a cord to hang it ' (Od. 13. 437).\nIn this connexion I would remind the reader of what\nhas already been stated (see above p. 190), namely, that,\nlong before I had the smallest notion that the One-Horse\nDawn scripts contain references to Oedipus, I had noted\ncf. the following lines in Oed. Tyr. 454-456, where the seer Teiresias\nforewarns Oedipus of the fate in store for him :\nTv<p\\bs yap e\/c dedopKdros\nKai TTTtoxbs avTi ir\\ovoLov ^ivrfv iiri\ncncqTTTpip TrpobtiKvvs yalav ifxTropeuaerai.\n(A blind man, he who now hath sight, a beggar, who now is\nrich, he shall make his way to a strange land, feeling the ground\nbefore him with a staff.)\n\flxxvi.] The \" One-Horse Dawn \" Experiment. 201\nthat the old man carrying \" a long stick in one hand,\nand a small square box in the other \" might be Odysseus\nin disguise. I was thinking, not of the passage in the\n13th Book of the Odyssey quoted by Jebb, but of the passage\nin the 17th Book where Odysseus is furnished by Eumaeus\nthe swineherd with staff and wallet, and in the disguise\nof a wretched beggar starts for his home. My attention\nwas drawn to this passage by a script of Miss Verrall's\nwritten in January 1915, which refers to it, and which\nalso in all probability refers back to Script H. The\nmatter, which is, it is true, a side-issue, but an important\none, is dealt with in Appendix A.\nCrux in dextra.\nThe first mention of the old man in white (Script G)\nbegins with the words \" Crux in dextra \" (\"a cross in\nthe right hand \"). The phrase is itself a crux, for it would\nbe sheer nonsense to represent Oedipus with a cross in\nhis hand. The simplest plan would be to dismiss the\nphrase as a mere mistake on the part of the automatist.\nA mistake I feel sure it was, but I think it is an explicable\none.\nThe second mention of the old man in white (Script D)\ndescribes him as carrying \" a long stick in one hand, and\na small square box in the other.\" If he is supposed to\nbe carrying a cross as well in one of his hands, he must\nhave had that hand rather full. But I do not think that\nthat is what is meant. The statement in Script D\nI take to be a correction (as also an amplification) of the\nstatement in Script C, whereby \" a long stick \" is sub-\nstituted for the cross. But how, it may be asked, did\nit come about, if all along a stick was the idea wanted,\nthat in the first instance the idea that emerged was a\ncross ? I would suggest that \" crux in dextra \" may have\nbeen the automatist's rendering of \"a crutch in the right\nhand.\" 1 A crutch is a beggar's staff with a crow-piece\n1\nSo far as this conjectural explanation is concerned, it does not matter\ntwopence whether the idea which the script is trying to express is being\ninstilled into the automatist's mind ab extra, or whether it is merely an\nidea latent in some stratum of her own uninfluenoed consciousness which\n\f202 J. G. Piddington. [part\nat the top, and is ultimately derived from the Latin crux,\na cross. So either the similarity of sound between crux\nand \" crutch,\" or the philological connexion between the\ntwo, or both, would easily enough account for \" a crutch\nin the right hand \" emerging as \" crux in dextra.\" The\noccurrence for the first time in Script P, where the crux\nis again mentioned, of the word bacillum\u2014the diminutive\nof baculus,1\nthe proper word for a staff or crutch\u2014tends,\nI think, to confirm the conjecture here advanced.\n\" Crux et praeterea nihil \" in Script P\u2014a phrase based,\nof course, on the proverbial \" Vox et praeterea nihil \"\n\u2014\nmay represent an attempt to dismiss the \" Crux in dextra\"\nof Script C as a mere empty echo. The outcome of the\nattempt, if it was made, was hardly a happy one ; for it\nseems fairly clear that the phrase made the automatist's\nthoughts turn in a Christian direction, with the result\nthat the remainder of the script is coloured in such a way\n(e.g. \" sume togaculam caritatis,\" \" monoicus,\" \" sanctis-\nsimi \") that no one, reading it by itself and without\nregard to its connexions with Scripts C and M, would\nimagine it referred to a legendary pagan character.\nI suspect that the Christian associations aroused by\n\" crux in dextra \" are similarly responsible for the words\nshe is struggling to summon up. As everyday experience teaches, things\nwe know we know but can't remember at a given moment, constantly\nemerge in some such fashion as I am suggesting here. I try to recall\nthe word \" cambric,\" and my mind in labour gives birth to the name\nYpres,\u2014a town which according to tho worst authorities gave, like\nCambrai, its name to a special kind of linen fabric. Such an association\nof ideas is considerably more involved than the one I am suggesting to\naccount for \" crux in dextra \" ; and yet no one, I venture to think,\nwould consider it unlike what really happens.\n1\nSeneca in his play of Oedipus, 1. 650, uses bacuius of Oedipus' staff\nor crutch :\n\" repet incertus viae,\nBaculo senili triste praotentans iter.\"\nJebb gives the Seneca quotation in his notes on O.T. 455-456 (referred\nto above, p. 200 footnote).\nDiminutive forms\u2014some extant, others not\u2014of both Greek and Latin\nwords are very common in Mrs. Verrall's early scripts. Script O alone\nfurnishes two examples besides bacillum : viz. \" togaculam \" (in error for\ntoyulam), and roscidulus (a very odd and indefensible diminutive form of\nroscidus ).\n\flxxvi.] The \" One -Horse Dawn \" Experiment. 203\n\" signifer ille \" (\"he is a standard-bearer\") being applied\nto the old man in white in Script C.

Here she is interpreting\nMrs. Holland's script of Dec. 22, 1909, Miss Verrall's\nscript of July 19, 1903 (Script V), and the following\npassage in Miss Verrall's script of Aug. 2, 1903, which I\nhave not hitherto quoted :\nreverstone Severn the banks merely the old place but new\nassociations.\nMrs. Willett's script of March 15, 1912, calls the river\nSevern a finger-post (i.e. as pointing to Ruskin) in order\nto explain the \" Conniston riverside . . . notice board\n\"\nand \" reverstone Severn \" of Miss Verrall's early scripts.\nBoth of Mrs. Willett's scripts (as do also two of those\nscripts of Mrs. Holland's which form part of the Coniston-\nBrantwood-Severn series) quote from the concluding passage\nof Myers's Obituary Notice of Ruskin.\nThis Obituary Notice, which appeared first in the Journal\nof the Society for Psychical Research for March 1900 (Vol. IX.\npp. 208-210) and was reprinted in 1904 in Myers's Frag-\nments of Prose and Poetry (pp. 89-94), ends thus :\nAnd turning then, with heart full of such-like fancies, to\nthat well-loved Leader's fate ; \u2014imagining his baffled isola-\ntion, and the disheartenment of solitary years ; \u2014I have\npictured him waiting in the Coniston woodlands, as OEdipus\nin Colonus' grove,\u2014waiting in mournful memory, in uncom-\nplaining calm,\u2014till he should hear at last the august\nsummons,\u2014nay, sounded it not like the loving banter ?\n\u2014\nof the unguessed accompanying God.

Thus two\ndistinct lines of argument have led us to the same con-\nclusion.\nThe Emphasis thrown on \" Loneliness.\"\nThe ideas of loneliness and of lonely wandering are, as\nthe following extracts show, considerably insisted on in\nthe One-Horse Dawn scripts :\nA.

I have suggested\nabove (pp. 203-204) that there is also an attempt to allude\nto the loneliness of the wandering Oedipus' death, although,\nstrictly speaking, he was not alone. But to the stress\nlaid on loneliness a third factor may have contributed :\nnamely, the passage in the Obituary Notice of Ruskin,\nwhere Myers speaks of\n\" his baffled isolation, and the disheartenment of\nsolitary years.\"\nThe lonely-wandering dawn, Oedipus oio^Wos and Oedipus\nparting from his daughters before his death, and the\nisolation of Ruskin ; \u2014all these, I suggest, were among\n\f210 J.

The scripts, as you\nyourself have observed, lay stress on the old man in white,\nnamely, in your view, on Oedipvis dressed for burial.\nBut the context of none of the three passages quoted in\nJebb's note relates to Oedipus being dressed for burial or\n1\nWith regard to the extract from Script J it may be objected that\nit is a Planet which \" illustre vagatur caelo sine comite,\" and that a\nman is not a planet and is not spoken of in the neuter (illustre). To\nthis I should reply that I take \" Planet \" to be used equivocally of the\nwandering dawn and of Oedipus TrXavrjTijs (i.e. planetes =\" wanderer \") ;\nthat the neater illustre. (if it really be neuter) is at once followed by\nthe words \" palely loitering,\" which in their original context in Keats'\npoem are applied to the Knight-at-arms and are therefore masculine ;\nand that the fiovdaroXos of H, to which the \"vagatur sine comite\" of\nJ seems to correspond, is masculine also.\nThe Latin of the scripts being far from classical, it is possible to take\nillustre, not as neuter singular, but as the adverb (\" brightly \") of\nillustris, although apparently only the comparative and superlative forms,\nillustrius and illustrissime, are found.\n\flxxvi.] The \" One-Horse Dawn\" Experiment. 211\nto his death ; and this being so, why do the scripts\nemphasise an incident\u2014culminating point of the play\nthough it be\u2014between which and the passages quoted by\nJebb no direct and immediate connexion is to be found?\n\"\nThis imaginary criticism\u2014which, having formulated it\nmyself, I regard as quite reasonable\u2014is, as I have said,\nto a large extent met, if we suppose that the intelligence\nresponsible for the scripts aimed at combining with the\nallusions to Jebb's note allusions to the closing passage\nof Myers's Obituary Notice and so to the death of Oedipus,\nfor the purpose of showing that it knew not only the\nactual words chosen by the experimenter but also the sense\nof loneliness which the experimenter thought the word\n[aovottwXos to possess.\nAnother consideration, however, may have actuated the\nintelligence responsible for the scripts. By repeatedly\nattempting to describe what is the climax of the play,\nthe death of Oedipus, he may have sought to ensure\nthe allusions to the other passages in the Oedipus Coloneus\n{i.e. those cited in Jebb's note on olo^wvov) being\nrecognised as such. The fact that these attempts were\nnot recognised for many years is not, I think, a sound\nreason for rejecting this suggestion.\nFinal, Remabks.\n\/\/ the interpretation put forward in this paper be accepted\n(this conditional clause governs, of course, all that follows), it\nseems certain that, so far as the allusions to Oedipus are\nconcerned, a result was obtained which, though successful,\nwas so unlike anything expected by the experimenter,\nthat he never realised the success achieved.\nIn ordinary life, if A tried to make B do a particular\nthing in a particular way, and B, while failing to do the\nthing in the way desired by A, nevertheless achieved ^4's\nobject by some totally different method, we should not\nascribe the successful result to A, except in so far as by\nsuggesting to B an object to be achieved he had stimu-\nlated B into activity in a given direction.

But anyhow A would get only the credit of having\nset the ball rolling.\nWe know that Dr. Verrall set the ball rolling ; but what\nwe don't know is whether it was he who kept it rolling.\nI think we may assume with absolute confidence that\nDr. Verrall did not consciously try to transfer telepathi-\ncally to Mrs. Verrall the substance of Jebb's note on the\nword oloQavov. Had he ever done so, not only would\nhe have placed the fact on record, as he did when he\ndeliberately \" fixed his mind on the notion of '\nhorse '\n\"\n(Proc. Vol. XX. p. 164) ; but he could hardly have failed\nto recognise the allusions in the scripts to the contexts of\nthe passages from the Oed. Col. which Jebb cites in his\nnote on olo^oovov. It is, I think, curious that he never\nrecognised the allusions to Oedipus even though he did\nnot in any way consciously associate Oedipus with the\nsubject of his experiment ; but that he should have failed\nto do so, had he consciously thought of Oedipus oi6fyi'o<;\nand of Jebb's note on oloXwvov in connexion with idLovoTraihov\ne? 'Aw, is, to my mind, at least, incredible.\nHe was, of course, familiar with both the Oedipus Tyrannus\nand the Oedipus Coloneus ;\nand, matter of fact, he\npossessed and used Jebb's editions of these two (and other)\nSophoclean plays.1\nAs, moreover, he was on terms of\nclose friendship with Sir Richard Jebb, and was for\nseveral years a neighbour of his, and as both he and\nJebb were devoted to the study of Greek dramatists,\nand were wont to exchange views on points of interpre-\ntation, grammar and so forth, it would be absurd to argue\nagainst the possibility of Jebb's note on olo^m'ov having\nbeen known to him. That he may well have been ac-\nquainted with it, is certain ; that he was acquainted with\nit, however, is not.\nBut, assuming that he had at one time been acquainted\nwith it, how are we to explain his failure to recognise the\nallusions to it in the scripts ?\n1\nFor detailed information see Appendix B.\n\f*\nlxxvi.] The \" One-Horse Dawn \" Experiment. 213\n\"Oh!\", I fancy I hear someone saying, \"the explana-\ntion's simple enough. The whole thing was due to sub-\nliminal memory and subliminal activity. Dr. Verrall had\nno conscious recollection of Jebb's note, but his subcon-\nsciousness remembered it and impressed Mrs. Verrall\ntelepathically with it.\"\nWell, perhaps so ;\nonly I would point out that in the\ncircumstances Dr. Verrall's failure to recover consciously a\nrecollection of a thing so accurately retained in his sub-\nconsciousness is a very singular phenomenon. For what\nwere the circumstances ? He did not try the experiment\nfor a moment or two, or an hour or two, or on one or\ntwo days, and then drop it for good and all. On the\ncontrary, it occupied his conscious thoughts, and was the\nsubject of his conscious efforts, over a long period, during\nwhich he regularly examined the scripts produced by\nMrs. Verrall ; and when the experiment was concluded,\nhe made a careful study of the scripts. Moreover, even\nif it be granted that the allusions in the scripts to Jebb's\nnote on ololwvov are recondite\u2014so recondite as to baffle\nwhat Mr. Bayfield has called Dr. Verrall's \" more than\nOedipodean acuteness as a solver of riddles\n\" 1\n\u2014, still\nthe allusions to the old man in white read in connexion\nwith the Greek words or phrases in Scripts C, E and K,\nought surely to have put one so versed in Greek drama\non the track of Oedipus, when ex hypothesi his subconscious\nthoughts were actively fixed on a note relating to Oedipus.\nI must confess that I find such a cleavage between the\nsubliminal and supraliminal strata of Dr. Verrall's conscious-\nness in the particular circumstances very hard to imagine.\nTen years of life remained to him after the experiment\nwas ended, and yet during all these years, notwithstanding\nhis constant study of Greek literature, he was to come\nacross nothing to awaken a conscious recollection of the\nconnexion, latent in his mind, between Jebb's note and\nthe words \/jlovottwXov e<; 'Aw\u2014the subject of his experiment\n\u2014discussed in that note.\n(It may be thought that I am here losing sight of the\n1\nMemoir of Dr. A.

I know that in the spring and autumn of 1915,\na year before she died, she read in Jebb's edition the\nChorus in praise of Colonus and Attica\u2014the evnnros\nChorus\u2014and also the Messenger's account of the death\nof Oedipus ; and I know from comments she sent me at\nthe time that she read Jebb's notes on both passages.\nYet neither did the eunnros Chorus convey any hint to her of\nthe meaning of eyiTnroi in Script K, nor the account of Oedipus'\ndeath any hint of the identity of the old man in white.\nHow strange an obfuscation of memory must be postu-\nlated, whether the origin of the Oedipus references be\ntraced to Dr. or to Mrs. Verrall !

In each\ncase the word <TKi)irTpov is used of the staff, though in\nOdyssey xvii po-wukov is used as well.\nAt the back of this script there lies, then, it seems to\nme, a knowledge of Jebb's note on (popei in O.C. 1262, and\nof a connexion between it and the old man in white of\nthe One-Horse Dawn scripts. For otherwise what happy\nchance led the automatist first to refer back to the old\nman in white \" journeying alone \" who is \" alone\nwith God and none other,\" and then to follow this\nby a reference to Odysseus as described in Odyssey xvii ?\nIf it be objected that the reference in Miss Verrall's\nscript is not to the lines in Odyssey xiii quoted by\nJebb, but only to a parallel passage in a later book, I\nwould reply that there is a good reason for the substitu-\ntion : the passage in Odyssey xvii involving a more pointed\nallusion to the home-coming of Odysseus (cf. \" the wan-\nderer home \") than the passage in the earlier book would\nhave done. The passage quoted by Jebb might, of course,\nhave served to point to the home-coming in a general\nway ; but the setting-out of Odysseus and Eumaeus \" from\nthe field to the city \" as told in Odyssey xvii marks the\nfinal stage of the long-delayed return ; and it is the final\nstage of the journey that is wanted to make a marked\nparallel with Oedipus going to his death.\nIt was this script of Miss Verrall's, as already stated (see\npp. 190 and 200-201 above), with its allusions to Odyssey\nxvii. 182-205 that led me more than two years ago to con-\njecture that the old man in white of Scripts C and D\nmight be Odysseus. I made a note to that effect on\nScript D, which I copy here :\n\" If the : longaevus senex '\nof M. V. 3049 [i.e. Script C]\nand here [i.e. Script DJ means Odysseus disguised as a\nbeggar, the words '\nMone inquit alteram ne titubet '\n[in D]\nwould have some sense. See Odyssey xvii. 196.

The '\nbox '\n[of D] would have to\nbe the Tn'\/pij or wallet which Odysseus carried\u2014not in his\nhand, but on his back. The poiraXov is also called a\ntriafirrpov (ib. 199). Cf. H.V. 17.\"\nMy reason for comparing H.V. 17 (i.e. Miss Verrall's\nscript of Nov. 22, 1906) was that its opening words are\nas follows :\nSenex cum albis capillis bifurcatis in sceptro incumbens\nsenectute praelapsus.\n(An old man with white hair parted in two (?) .\nleaning\non a staff, advanced (?) in age.)\nThe Latin is odd and incorrect. Thus, the word bifur-\ncatis (formed from an imaginary verb bifurco) does not\nexist, though bifurcus (\"two-forked\"), which no doubt it\nrepresents, does. Here the sense intended seems to be\n\" parted in two.\" 1 Next, sceptro is used as if it were the\nGreek uKi']irTpGv (skeptron), which may mean either a staff\nused for support in walking, or a staff borne by a king\nas an emblem of authority, i.e. a sceptre. But though\nthe Latin sceptrum is the same word as aK^irTpov, and\nmeans a sceptre, it is not used in the sense of a staff.\nThe use of sceptro in the script to mean a staff accordingly\nseems to point to a Greek rather than a Latin topic.\nPraelapsus, which in view of the context I have ventured\nto render \" advanced,\" properly means \" having glided\nforward.\"\nBut however the incorrect words be rendered, it is\npractically certain that the Latin sentence refers back to\nthe \" longaevus senex barba alba \" of Script C, who in\nScript D is called \" albicapillus,\" and to the \" incumbe\nbacillo \" of P and Q.\n1\nMr. G. W. Balfour suggests that if bifurcato be read instead of bifur-\ncatis the allusion might be to Oedipus leaning on his two daughters.\nCf. Oed.

I have no explanation to offer\nof why the subject thus cropped up again four years\nafter the experiment was brought to a close, unless it\nbe that the publication in or about October 1906 of\nMrs. Verrall's account of the experiment revived interest\nin it. But then what about the re-emergence of the sub-\nject on July 19, 1903, in Scripts U and V ? So far as\nI am aware, there was nothing at that date to redirect\nattention to the experiment. There may, of course, have\nbeen something of which I never heard ; but if so, how\nthen did Mrs. Verrall fail to associate her vision of a\ntall man in a white long robe (Script U) with the old\nman in white of her One-Horse Dawn scripts ?\nFurthermore, I have argued that Miss Verrall's script\nof January 28, 1915, likewise harks back to the experi-\nment of 1901-1902.

And if so, before or after death ?\nIf before death, then Miss Verrall must have acquired her\ninformation telepathically from him more than two years\nand a half before it emerged in her script.\nOr was Mrs. Verrall the \" agent \" ? She saw Miss\nVerrall's script of January 28, 1915, for the first time on\nor about October 20, 1915. Between March and October 8,\n1915, not only had her own script twice referred to the\ndeath of Oedipus, but on at least three different occasions\nshe had been reading\u2014in connexion, be it noted, with\nscripts and not in connexion with her classical studies\n\u2014\nvarious passages in the Oed. Col., and reading them in\nJebb's edition, and consulting several at least of Jebb's\nnotes on these passages. From notes she made between\nSeptember 28 and October 8, 1915, hi my possession, it is\nclear that she read carefully the part of the Messenger's\nspeech where he describes Oedipus coming to the hill of\nDemeter Euchloos and being washed by his daughters ;\nand in these notes she refers specifically to O.C. 1598-1602.\nNow since the latter part of 1. 1602 and 1. 1603 are\n\\0VTp0l9 T6 VIV\necrd>jTi t e^)'i<TK>i<Ta.v f]\nvo\/ul^erai\n(Then they ministered to him with washing, and dressed\nhim, as use ordains),\nshe must have read the actual lines which explain why\nthe old man of the One-Horse Dawn scripts is dressed in\nwhite. Yet when, on October 20, 1915\u2014or a day or two\nlater\u2014she saw in her daughter's script of January 28,\n1915, the phrase \" Alone with God none other no not\none,\" which in her own script of 1901 had been applied\nto the old man in white, she failed to recognise it as a\nreference back to the old man. This failure, especially\nwhen her recent interest in the Oedipus Coloneus is taken\n\f222 J. G. Piddington. [part\ninto account, seems to argue a singular impenetrability\nof her supraliminal consciousness, if less than nine months\nearlier her subliminal activities had really been responsible\nfor the allusion in Miss Verrall's script to Jebb's note on\nthe wallet of Oedipus. She neither recognised the refer-\nence back to Script H in \" alone with God none other\nno not one,\" nor did she in any way connect her daughter's\nscript with Oedipus. This I know because she sent me\nnotes on Miss Verrall's script of January 28, 1915 ; and\nthese notes make no mention of Script H or of Oedipus ;\nand had she traced any connexion with either, I am\nperfectly certain she would have told me.\nWhatever may be the true solution of the problem, it\nwill, I think, be generally admitted that there is a very\nstrong presumption indeed that whatever intelligence was\nresponsible for the allusions to Jebb's note on oioXiovov\nin 1901-1902 was likewise responsible for the allusions to\nthe tall man in a white long robe and to Coniston in\n1903, and to the allusion to Jebb's note on Oedipus'\nwallet in January 1915.\nAPPENDIX B.\nDr. Verrall's familiarity with Jebb's editions of the\nOedipus Coloneus and Oedipus Tyrannus.\nDr. Verrall reviewed Jebb's edition of the Oedipus\nColoneus, probably early in 1886. The edition of the\nOedipus Tyrannus he had reviewed earlier. These facts\nI derive from the Life and Letters of Sir Richard Claver-\nJiouse Jebb (p. 262).\nTo the Life and Letters he also contributed a chapter\non Jebb as Scholar and Critic. This chapter shows his\nthorough and detailed acquaintance with Jebb's work. Of\nJebb's editions of Sophocles' plays he deals in this chapter\nonly with the Philoctetes and the Trachiniae. He does\nnot, I think, so much as mention the editions of the\nOedipus Coloneus and Oedipus Tyrannus ;\nthough, of course,\n\flxxvi.] The \" One-Horse Dawn \" Experiment. 223\nthis affords no reason for assuming that he was not just\nas well acquainted with them as with the editions of the\nother plays.\nMrs. Salter (Miss Verrall) has kindly allowed me to\nexamine copies of Jebb's Oedipus Tyrannus and Oedipus\nColoneus used by her father.\nIn the copy of the O.T. I have found no pencilled\nmarginal notes either on the text or on the foot-notes ;\nand only one marginal note in the Appendix. There is\nno note or mark of any kind on the page containing the\nfoot-note on oloCoavov.\nIn his copy of Jebb's edition of the Oedipus Coloneus\nDr. Verrall has entered a number of marginal notes,\nrelating chiefly to the text or to the apparatus criticus ;\nand has also marked a good number of the foot-notes,\nand occasionally made a comment on them.\nAs regards the three passages from the Oed. Col. quoted\nby Jebb in his edition of the O.T. in connexion with the\nword oioCwvov, I find that Dr. Verrall has made no\nmark against, or comment on, S\u00abtt6\\ov? aSe\\<pa$, and\nnone on 7rvKv6-7TTepoi cujSoves. Against Jebb's note on\neKaTo\/unr68wi> N>\/|<j\/\/cW he has placed the following comment :\n\" Surely Sophocles means 100 Nereids.\" This comment\ndoes not concern Jebb's view that the second part of the\ncompound adjective is equivalent to a separate epithet for\nthe noun ; but concerns merely Jebb's view as to the\nnumber of the Nereids, which he (Jebb) places at fifty,\nwith characteristic matter-of-factness assigning them two\nfeet apiece.\nAPPENDIX C.\nIn Proc. Vol. XX. pp. 163-164 Mrs. Verrall dealing with\nthe words in Script I (September 9, 1901) :\n\" Find the herb moly that will help\u2014it is a guide,\"\nwrote as follows :\nWe could attach no meaning to the allusion to Milton's\np\n\f224 J. G. Piddington. [part\nphrase ;\n1\nthe passage in Comus (11. 636-7) seemed to have\nno bearing on the context, and recalled nothing to my\nhusband either at the time or later when he revealed his\nexperiment to me, and we examined in detail together all\nthe writing of these weeks. But in the spring of 1905,\nwhen I was writing this paper and had ascertained that\nthe passage of the Orestes [containing the words \/j.ovowu>\\ov\ne? 'Aco] was set in the last paper of the Classical Tripos of\n1873, it occurred to me to look at the other papers set\nin that year, and I found that the subject for Latin Hexa-\nmeters in the Tripos of 1873 was the passage from Comus,\nending,\n\" And yet more med'cinal is it than that moly\nWhich Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave.\"\nIt appears that the combination of the letters m o I,\nproduced in the effort to give the word p-ovoirwhov,\nhad,\nby some association of ideas, suggested a reminiscence of\nanother paper in the same Tripos examination. The\ncurious point about this is that the recollection had\nentirely gone from my husband's mind ; when I asked\nhim if he had any recollection of other papers in the\nTripos, and in particular of the Latin Verse, he could\nrecall nothing, and even the sight of the passage in Comus\ndid not revive any memory of having translated it. . . .\nMy script seems to have registered here not only an\nexisting mental impression of my husband's, but also a\nforgotten past impression, once closely associated with the\nfirst.\nMrs. Verrall's suggestion (for it is hardly a conclusion)\nthat the coincidence between the \" moly \" of her script\nand the \" moly \" of the Tripos paper was not an acciden-\n1\n1 suppose that Mrs. Verrall spoke of \" the allusion to Milton's\nphrase,\" because of the preceding: \" dailey is more like, \u2014daily bent,\"\nwhich, presumably, she connected with\n\" and the dull swain\nTreads on it daily with its clouted shoon ;\nAnd yet more med'cinal is it than that Moly,\" etc.\nIf this was not her reason, I see no justification for calling the words\nin the script an \" allusion to Milton's phrase.\"\n\flxxvi.] The \" One-Horse Dawn \" Experiment. 225\ntal one, seems to me to ignore two important considera-\ntions :\n(a) the wide field for chance-coincidence afforded by the\npapers set in a Classical Tripos examination ;\n(b) the constant appearance in her scripts of 1901 and\n1902, both before and after \" moly \" was written,\nof words in which the letters m o I and m a I are\nprominent, and the absence of any indication that\n\" Moly,\" rather than one of these other words,\nwas the word wanted.\nAs regards (a) nothing further need be said, for it must,\nI think, be admitted that the opportunities for chance-\ncoincidence were large.\nAs regards (b), the evidence, tedious though it be, must\nbe given in full. I accordingly append a list of all \" the\nwords in Mol \" (as for brevity I shall call them) that I\nhave traced in Mrs. Verrall's scripts during the period\ncovered by the One-Horse Dawn Experiment.

[part\nit would be just possible to argue that \" Molyten \" and\n\" Molison \" are attempts at a different word or name than\n\" Moly \" ; but I think nevertheless that the natural\nmeaning is that \" Moly \" is rejected in favour of other\nwords which by the addition to \" Mol \" of the syllable\n\" en \" or \" on \" approach more nearly to MonopOLON.\nMoreover, no sooner has the word \" moly \" been written\nthan in the next two scripts\u2014not to speak of the ten\nother subsequent scripts\u2014fresh shots at words in Mol\ncontinue to be made ; and this, to my mind at least,\nstrongly suggests dissatisfaction with \" Moly.\"\nThe theory, then, that the \" moly \" of Script I is\ncausally connected with Dr. Verrall's subliminal recollection\nof the occurrence of the word \" moly \" in a Classical\nTripos paper, seems to me to rest on an insufficient\nfoundation.\nAPPENDIX D.\nIn compliance with a suggestion made by Sir Oliver\nLodge and Miss Alice Johnson, I give below in chrono-\nlogical order the dates of various events which either\nhave or may have a bearing on the case.\n1873.

[PART\nII.\nEVIDENCE OF SUPER-NORMAL COMMUNICATIONS\nTHROUGH MOTOR AUTOMATISM.\nA Paper read at a Private Meeting op the Society\non November 22, 1917.\nBy Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nThe cases which I wish to bring before the Society in\nthis paper have this in common, that in them we see\nsupernormal communication issuing in motor automatism.\nThe source of the communication however differs in an im-\nportant manner, for in the first case the communicator was\nin the body and in the second the message purports to\ncome from the discarnate.1\nI am indebted to my niece, Mrs. Cowdell Barrett, of\nWeymouth, for putting me into communication with her\nfriend, Mr. Arundel Mackenzie-Ashton, of Dene Court,\nTaunton, who kindly sent me the contemporary documents\nwhich narrate this case.2\n1 am permitted to give his name and also that of\nColonel Nicholson, whose account of the experiments,\nwritten down at the time, have fortunately been preserved\n1\n1 do not here raise the question of the method of communication, but a\nseparate note by me on Telepathy and Telergy which follows this paper may\nsuggest possibilities and tend to clearer thinking on the subject.\n2\nSubsequent to the reading of this paper before the Society, the\ncase was quoted in an article I published in the Contemporary Review\nfor February, 1918.\n\flxxvi.] Evidence of Super-normal Communications. 231\nand axe before me, otherwise the case would be of little\nevidential value as it occurred some years a^o The\nexperiments took place at Walesby Vicarage, Nottingham-\nshire, in 1882.\nMr. Mackenzie-Ashton writes to me as follows :\u2014\nDene Court, Taunton,\nOctober 9th, 1917.\nI went to stay at Walesby Vicarage situated in Notting-\nhamshire in September, 1882. I was there a week or ten\ndays and on leaving went to stay with my father and\nmother who lived at a place called Minewood in Hertford-\nshire. The distance between these two places is about\n130 miles. After I left Walesby Mr. (now Colonel) Nichol-\nson and Mrs. Nicholson went there, I believe the day\nfollowing my departure. The manifestation referred to in\nMr. Nicholson's letters, which I enclose, took place at the\nfirst sitting at which Mrs. Nicholson assisted.\nHere I will give Mr. Nicholson's first letter to Mr\nMackenzie-Ashton, which was sent to me in its original\njXtT\ndated P\u00b0St-\nmark'\nas also were his subsequent\nNewark on Trent, 14 9 '8\u00b0\nDear Sir,\nI have been staying at Walesby Vicarage recently and\nlast evenmg (Wednesday) we amused ourselves with table-\nturning. The table when asked by whose spirit it was\npossessed answered \" Arundel-Mackenzie,\" and to the\nfurther question \"where is he?\" it said \"His soul is\nhere.\" To the following question \"How is his bodv\noccupied ?\n\" it returned a perfectly definite answer. Would\nyoul mind informing me how you were really occupied last\nnight from 10.30 to 11.30 p.m. and in whose company\nyou were? Would you mind also telling me what you\nwere doing out of doors in the day time ? I hope you\nwill excuse me, who am a perfect stranger to you, asking\nyou these impertinent questions, but I am most anxious to\nbe satisfied as to the truth or falsehood of the \"\nmanifesta-\ntion. -Yours very truly, E. H. Nicholson\n\f232 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nTwo days later Mr. Nicholson writes as follows :\nNewark on Trent, Sept. 16.\nDear Sir.\nWill you assure me on your word of honour you have\nheard nothing from any person who was at Walesby\nVicarage on Wednesday evening relative to the occurrence\nabout which I wrote to you ? \u2014Yours very truly,\nE. H. Nicholson.\nMr. Mackenzie-Asbton having given this assurance then\nreceived the following letter from Mr. Nicholson describing\nwhat occurred :\nNewark, Sept. 19, 1882.\nDear Sir,\nWhen I asked for your assurance I felt it was scarcely\nnecessary, but the experiences being so extraordinary it\nseemed more satisfactory to have it.\nThe persons who had their hands on the table besides\nMrs. Nicholson and myself were [giving their names]. The\ntable began immediately to move and on being asked to\ntilt 3 times if a spirit were present it did so, asked\n\"whose spirit,\" replied \" Arundel-Mackenzie,\" and would\ngive no further name. \" Asked where is he, and what\nis he doing?\" answered \"His soul is here.\" Asked \"what\nis his body doing,\" at first we obtained no reply and were\nrather puzzled how to proceed thinking possibly you were\nin bed. However after waiting, we asked the same\nquestion again and the reply was promptly given \" Playing\nbilliards.\" Time then was 11.15 p.m. Asked who is in\nthe room with him ? answer \" Father,\" asked \" who is\nwinning the game?\" answer \"Son.\" \"How many games\nhave been played ?\n\" \"Two.\" \"What has he been doing\nduring the day ? \" \" Shooting.\" At this there was a\ngeneral exclamation \" Impossible !\n\" for it was not believed\nyou had any shooting, and H asked \" Pheasants or\nPartridges \" laughing, but we could get no more. H by\nrequest then left the table, and we asked the spirit why\nit had not replied. It answered \" flippant.\" After a\nmessage '\nsilent spirit is here,' we could get no further\nmanifestation.\n\flxxvi.] Evidence of Super-normal Communications. 233\nThis is a literal and exact statement of what took place.\nBefore the letters at which the table tilted were reached a\nmost peculiar tremor went through it, increasing in inten-\nsity till the letter was reached when the tilting was\ndecided and distinct. The lights in the room were not\nlowered. This experience has thoroughly astonished me.\n\u2014\nYours faithfully, E. H. Nicholson.\nNow all the above particulars given by Mr. Nicholson\nof Mr. Mackenzie-Ashton's doings were perfectly correct.\nMr. Mackenzie-Ashton writes :\n\" I had been shooting during the day and in the evening\nI had two games of billiards with my father. I won both\nof them, and after that I lay down on a couch in the\nbilliard room and fell asleep. Then I had a dream that\nI was back in Walesby Vicarage. One point of interest\nis that I (my spirit) gave only my original name ; I took\nthe additional name of Ashton later \" [but prior to this\nexperience].\nIt is unfortunate that Colonel Nicholson did not keep\nMr. Mackenzie-Ashton's letters up to the present time, as\nin that case we should have written contemporary evidence\nfrom both sides. However, Colonel Nicholson informs me\nthat he preserved the letters for a long time and corrobo-\nrates Mr. Mackenzie-Ashton's statement.\nOf the trustworthiness and evidential value of this case\nthere can be no doubt. It is of considerable psychological\ninterest on several grounds. Here we find telepathy from\na living person giving rise to motor automatism in the\ntable tilting, whilst answers to questions are given just\nas we are accustomed to find in spiritistic phenomena. As\nColonel Nicholson informs me he has had similar experiences\nelsewhere, he was, presumably, the medium.\nTelepathy from the living producing motor automatism\nin the percipient is by no means novel. We have the\nwell-known case of the Rev. P. H. Newnham and his\nwife, where questions mentally asked by Mr. Newnham\nwere automatically replied to by Mrs. Newnham through\n\f234 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nplanchette writing.1\nThough the distance apart of agent\nand percipient was here only a few feet, care was taken\nthat no knowledge of the question, which was written\ndown by Mr. Newnham, should reach his wife. Similar\nexperiments were subsequently tried, with more or less\nsuccess, between two graduates at Cambridge, and there\nare other cases on record where telepathic impressions\nfrom the living were able to produce motor automatism\nthrough planchette, etc. As regards table tilting, Prof.\nRichet 2\nlong ago\u2014in 1884\u2014made an arrangement whereby\nletters of the alphabet were silently pointed to by one\nperson who traversed the alphabet mechanically, whilst\nProf. Richet, standing apart from the alphabet ana others\npresent, thought of a name or word which neither the\nman at the alphabet nor the automatist had any means\nof knowing. The automatist was seated at a table, which\ntilted when the man at the alphabet pointed to the right\nletter in the word thought of by Prof. Richet. The\nexperiment was fairly successful, the success being beyond\nmere chance coincidence. Here it will be noticed that\nboth agent and percipient were in the same room and\nboth awake and in their normal state. There is a case\ngiven by Mr. Myers, the Kirby case, where messages were\ngiven by table tilting which possibly came from a far\ndistant and sleeping agent.3\nIn the last named case, as Mr. Myers points out, we\ncannot really say which is the easier hypothesis\u2014telepathy\nor a psychical invasion from the distant agent. The well-\nestablished and well-known experiments by Mr. S. Beard,\nRev. S. Moses, and Rev. C. Godfrey, where the different\nexperimenters willed that they should be seen by a distant\nperson who was unaware that the experiment was being\nmade, were all successful when the agents were asleep. The\nself-projection did not occur when the agent was consciously\nwilling it, but took place when he was unconscious in\nsleep. There are several well-attested cases where a\nperson asleep has dreamt he has visited a distant friend\n1\nHuman Personality, Vol. II. p. 147.\n\"-Proc. S.P.R., Vol. II. pp. 239-264.\n3\nHuman Personality, Vol. II. p. 187.\n\flxxvi.] Evidence of Super-normal Communications. 235\nand has been heard speaking by that friend. These and\nother cases suggest allocation, or some excursive action of\nthe soul or of the subliminal self of the '\nagent ' during\nsleep. Myers has some suggestive remarks on the freedom\nof the spirit from the material organism during sleep.\nI will now pass on to a second series of cases of super-\nnormal action where a discarnate intelligence appears to\nbe the agent, causing vigorous motor automatism on the\npart of the automatist.\nSome time ago my friend, the Rev. Savell Hicks, M.A.,\nand myself read a paper before the Society describing the\nremarkable experiments with a novel form of ouija board,\nwhich a small circle in Dublin had been conducting with\ngreat care and critical ability for many months. These\nexperiments have now been in progress for over two\nyears, but no record of them has appeared in the Pro-\nceedings of our Society. In my recently published book\nOn the Threshold of the Unseen, I have fully described\nhow these experiments are conducted, and some of the\nstartling evidence of survival after death which they appear\nto afford.1\nHere I will only say that instead of the usual ouija\nboard, with the alphabet printed on the board, the\nseparate letters of the alphabet, on pieces of card, are\nplaced on a small table below a sheet of plate glass\nwhich covers the whole table. The traveller or indicator,\nwhich is touched by the two sitters, is a small triangular\nor heart-shaped piece of wood or metal resting on three\ntoes of felt, so that it is only raised some quarter of an\ninch from the glass. The alphabet can be arranged in\nany order, and in some critical experiments which I have\ndescribed the letters were arranged in the most irregular\nand promiscuous fashion, whilst the sitters were out of\nthe room. The glass top was then covered by an opaque\ncloth, the sitters were recalled and carefully blindfolded,\ntaking every precaution to make the blindfolding abso-\nlutely effective. The cloth was removed, the traveller\nplaced on the glass and the sitters each put one hand on\n1\nOn the Threshold of the Unseen, p. 179 et seq.\n\f236 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nthe traveller. The sitting then began in full light so that\nthe recorder could note down the letters indicated ; the\nrecorder was either the Rev. Savell Hicks, myself, or a\npersonal friend, who was a good shorthand writer; this was very\nnecessary in some of the sittings, as the traveller rushed\nfrom letter to letter with such rapidity that it was\ndifficult to keep pace with it in writing down the message.\nIn one memorable instance, when a message was being\nspelt out with great rapidity, an opaque fire-screen was\nsilently held over the traveller, so that had the sitters\nnot been blindfolded they could not then see the alphabet\nbelow, and the recorder had to adjust the light and his\nposition to enable him to take down the message, which\ncame through rapidly just as before.\nSome of the messages appeared to be pure dream\ncreations, but given with great dramatic force. They may\nhave been the product of some unknown intelligence who\nwas asleep, whether incarnate or discarnate I do not know.\nSome messages were veridical and purported to come\nfrom different persons recently deceased. The sitters were\nusually the daughter of the late Professor Dowden, Mrs.\nTravers Smith, the wife of a well-known Dublin medical\nman, and her friend, Mr. Lennox Robinson, an author.\nBlindfolding was often dispensed with. In the case I\nnarrated at a recent meeting of the Society, and which\nis given in my book, the \" Pearl tie-pin case,\" the sitters'\nwere Mrs. T. Smith and a lady friend, Miss D. C, the\ndaughter of a physician.\nAs the exact transcript of the foregoing message, taken\ndown at the time, has not been published, I give it here.\nMiss C. had a cousin, a young officer in the army in\nFrance, who was killed a month previous to the sitting.\nThis was known to the sitters, who were not blindfolded\non this occasion.\nThe sitting took place at 61 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin,\nin December, 1915. It began as follows :\nQ. Who is there ?\nA. [The cousin's full name was given, Christian\nand surname.]\n\flxxvi.] Evidence of Super-normal Communications. 237\nQ. Do you know who I am ?\nA. Yes, you are D .\nQ. Have you any message ?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What is it ?\nA. Tell my mother to give my pearl tie-pin to the girl I\nwas going to marry. I think she ought to have it.\nQ. What is her address ?\nA. [An address in London was given.]\nQ. What is her name ?\n[Full Christian name and surname given (an unusual\none).]\nA. I want to go. Good-bye.\nNeither of the sitters knew any such person nor of any\nengagement. On communicating with the deceased officer's\nfamily they knew nothing of the lady mentioned in the\nmessage ;\nmoreover, on writing to the address given the\nletter was returned by the Post Office. The whole message\nwas therefore considered a fabrication.\nSix months later it was discovered that the officer had\nbeen engaged, shortly before he left for the front, to the\nvery lady whose name was given ; he had however told\nno one. Neither his cousin nor any of his own family\nin Ireland were aware of the fact and had never seen\nthe lady nor heard her name, until the War Office sent\nover the deceased officer's effects. Then they found that\nhe had put this lady's name in his will as his next of\nkin, both Christian and surname being precisely the same\nas given through the automatist ;\nand, what is equally\nremarkable, a pearl tie-jnn was found in his effects. Both\nthe sitters have signed a document they sent me, affirming\nthe accuracy of the above statement, the message being\nrecorded at the time, and not written from memory after\nverification had been obtained. Here there could be no\nexplanation of the facts by subliminal memory, or tele-\npathy or collusion, and the evidence points unmistakably\nto a telepathic message from the deceased officer.\nNow this appears to be an unexpected psychical invasion\nof the sitters by some personality of whom they were not\n\f238 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.8. [part\nthinking. A mere fragmentary message of an earth-memory,\na voice from out of the darkness, \" only a signal shown,\nthen darkness again and a silence,\" and it suggests that\nit might have been a passing dream of the discarnate\ncommunicator which happened to synchronise with the\nsitting and receptive condition of his relative. Other\nevidence, as we know, points to the intelligent co-operation\nof two or more unseen communicators, which cannot be\nattributed to their passing dreams.\nIn the next case we are presented with a typical com-\nbination of romance and veridical statements which it is\ndesirable to put on record in detail for the future student\nof experimental psychology.\nThe sitters were Mrs. Travers Smith and Mr. Lennox\nRobinson. An outline of the first part of this remarkable\nrecord has already been published by me under the title\nof the \" Hugh Lane Case,\" 1\nbut full details have not been\ngiven hitherto.\nIn the first of these sittings, on May 7, 1915, both\nsitters were blindfolded, and the recorder was the Rev.\nSavell Hicks, M.A., who writes to me as follows :\n\" It should be borne in mind that this sitting took place\nwithout any idea of obtaining anything startling or evi-\ndential. What came through was so entirely unexpected\nthat both sitters were laughing and talking to one another\nas the message came through, and I gave them no hint\nof the purport of what was coming through until the\nmessage was completed. I am quite convinced that they\nhad no idea of what their hands were spelling out. When\nthe first part of the message was completed and I\nread it aloud, both the sitters broke down and wept, as\nthey were both intimate friends of Sir Hugh Lane. Such\na piece of heartless playacting, as one must assume if they\nwere cognisant of what was coming through, is, as no\ndoubt you will agree, knowing them both, quite unthink-\nable. Whether they were, in some mysterious way, sub-\nconsciously aware of what they were doing, I cannot of\ncourse say ; this of course can neither be proved or\nOn the Threshold of the Unseen, p. 186.\n\flxxvi.] Evidence of Super-normal Communications. 239\ndisproved.\" [The affirmation would involve clairvoyance by\nthe sitters, as they were blindfolded.]\nMr. Hicks goes on to say\n:\n\" At the time of the sitting it was known that the\nLusitania had been sunk, but it was only after the first\npart of the message had come through that Mr. Lennox\nRobinson went down and brought up a stop press edition\nof an evening paper just issued that contained the news\nthat Sir Hugh Lane was on board. [No news of his death\nwas received till some days after this sitting.] That the\npossibility of his being on board may have been present\nin the minds of the sitters is, of course, conceivable. [As\nto this, see Mrs. T. Smith's letter which follows].\nHow much of the record can be attributed to super-\nnormal agency is a matter which must be left to individual\nopinion ; on this point the sitters have, as you know, an\nentirely open mind ; and none of us concerned in this\nrecord have any dogmatic opinion on the subject.\"\nMrs. Travers Smith writes to me as follows :\nDear Sir William Barrett,\nAs you were not present at our seance on the night\non which we received the first communication from Sir\nHugh Lane, telling us he was drowned, I think it is best\nthat I should give the facts, which are as follows : Mr.\nLennox Robinson and I were both friends of Sir Hugh\nLane ; we knew that he had gone to America, but he had\nbeen there for a very short time, and it never occurred\nto either of us that he might be on board the \" Lusitania.\"\nWe knew nothing of his plans. In the afternoon of the\nday on which the \"Lusitania\" sank, the Dublin papers\nannounced \" '\nLusitania '\nreported sinking.\" We knew\nnothing further than this at 8 p.m. (when our seance\nbegan) ; and Sir Hugh Lane's name certainly never occurred\nto us in connection with the lost ship.\nAfter the first sentences came through announcing Hugh\nLane as present, and that he was drowned, a \" stop press\n\"\nwas called in the street. Mr. Robinson ran down, brought\na paper up, and pointed to Sir Hugh Lane's name in the\nlist of \" Lusitania \" passengers.\n\f240 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.B.S. [part\nThe Rev. E. Savell Hicks, M.A., who was present, will\nbear witness that my statement is correct. I have his\noriginal record in my possession.

If you had\nknown Sir Hugh well, you would understand how very\ncharacteristic of him the remarks he made were. Ellie\nand Jim are Mr. and Mrs. , both intimate friends of\nmine and of Sir Hugh also.

As regards\ncertain details given in the message, such as to the\nnumber on board the \" Lusitania,\" the cabin occupied by\nSir Hugh Lane, and the person named Kenneth Dowson,\nI understand that no corroboration has been obtained.\nVarious other messages concerning his pictures came from\nSir Hugh Lane which were of interest but not evidential.\nMeanwhile the relatives of Sir Hugh Lane doubted the\nauthorship of the message which they understood began\n\" Pray for the soul of Hugh Lane,\" as that resembled a\nRoman Catholic expression and Sir Hugh Lane was a\nProtestant. The record, however, says \" Pray for Hugh\nLane\" not '\nsoul of.' The sitters themselves, however, were\nnot wholly convinced, and when Mrs. T. Smith invited\nme to a sitting with Mr. Lennox Robinson at her house\nin 1917, we discussed the pros and cons of the veridical\ncharacter of the message.\n\flxxvi.] Evidence of Super-normal Communications. 243\nThe sitting then began in full daylight in the afternoon\nof August 22, 1917, at 8 Upper Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin.\nNeither of the sitters (Mrs. Travers Smith and Mr. Lennox\nRobinson) were blindfolded on this occasion, but the latter,\nwhose hand controlled the movement of the indicator, sat\nwith head averted and eyes closed and soon fell into a\npartial trance. Lady Barrett and her sister besides myself\nwere present, and the two former acted as recorders.\nThe same type of ouija board was used, a slab of glass\nwith alphabet below. The right hand of Mrs. T. Smith\nand left of Mr. Robinson were on the traveller with little\nfingers interlocked. At first the traveller rushed round\nand round as if polishing the glass, and then proceeded\nmore slowly to inspect, as it were, each letter of the\nalphabet, going round each letter till all were located.\nThe decision and accuracy of this inspection were notice-\nable, albeit the sitters were not looking at the traveller.\nI will give the whole record, as it presents the same\ncurious mixture of, apparently, fictitious and veridical\ncommunications which are so characteristic of these auto-\nmatisms :\nSitting, August 22, 1917.\nQ. Is any one here ?\nA. Peter Rooney [the usual control].\nQ. Do you recognise any one present ?\nA. There is a man here I saw in the other house, there\nwas another man there also, a younger man. [This\nrefers to myself and the Rev. Mr. Robertson at the\nsitting we had in Mrs. Travers Smith's former house.]\nQ. Will you bring some one here we know ?\nA. Let me make my experiment first.\n[Mrs. T. Smith said this referred to guessing a\nnumber written on paper and held below the table.\nThis was done and the traveller rushed to the corner\nof the table beneath which the number was concealed\nand then back to indicate the number ; but the success\nwas only partial.]\nQ. Will you go away ?\nA. Yes I am going to send a new control.\n\f244 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\n[The hands were lifted off traveller for a moment and\nthen replaced, and the following came] :\nA. Why am I sent here ?\nQ. Who are you ?\nA. My name is Lennon.\nQ. What is your Christian name ?\nA. Frank.\nQ. Where did you live ?\nA. I lived at 22 Mills [or Mill] Lane, Sheffield.\nQ. When did you pass over ?\nA. March 3, 1917.\nQ.

[This is explained by the advent of the next\ncontrol.]\n\flxxvi.] Evidence of Super-normal Communications. 245\nThis child control was told to go away and hands were\nlifted off the traveller for a moment. When the two sitters\nreplaced their hands an extraordinary change of control\noccurred. The traveller dashed violently about, rushing\nto one letter after the other so quickly that it was im-\npossible to follow the message spelt.\nMrs. T. Smith said :\nQ. Don't be so violent, do go quietly. Who are you ?\nA. Surely this is Lennox.\nQ. Who are you ?\nA. I am Hugh Lane [this was spelt out most emphati-\ncally]. I have been waiting for a long time to talk,\nand am unable to communicate when you are not\nhere.\nThe traveller became most excited and flew about so\nswiftly and violently that Mrs. T. Smith said :\nQ. Why are you so furious ? Don't be so violent.\nA. I am very angry with her, with Hester.\nQ. Who is it you are so angry with ?\nA. [Given most emphatically]. I am angry with Hester\nTravers Smith. I am vexed because I heard her\nsaying it was not I who spoke that night. I made\na great effort to speak that night and this is the\nway she doubts me. I was here again and again,\nand could not speak because Lennox was not here.\nI tell you I am Hugh Lane [most emphatically, even\nfiercely given], and I came to you the night I was\ndrowned.\nQ. Why did you say \" Pray for the soul of Hugh Lane \" ?\nA. I did not say that [most emphatic] ;\nthe control who\nwas at the board and guided me here said it. I\nwould never have thought of saying such a thing. I\nonly said \" I am Hugh Lane.\" [The control was\nPeter Rooney, an Irish American R.C.]\nQuestions were then asked if Sir Hugh Lane remembered\nmeeting Sir W. Barrett, and he replied, \" Yes, quite well.\"\nAsked, can you see him ? The answer was \" No, I only\nsee you two.\" The question was then asked :\n\f246 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [PART\nQ. What are you doing now ?\nA. [Given in an angry, violent manner]. I did not come\nhere to make an interesting sitting for your friends ;\nI came to tell you, Hester, what a fool you are !\nHere we had to stop for a moment as Mr. Lennox\nRobinson, whose averted head had fallen down, seemed as\nif he would faint, and we asked :\nQ. Can you not make use of Mrs. Travers Smith and leave\nMr. Robinson alone ?\nA. I only have hold of Lennox. I held him tight until\nI could get no more out of him.\nAgain we had to stop as Mr. Lennox Robinson was\nevidently on the point of complete collapse. So we led\nhim to the sofa and made him lie down. In a few\nminutes he recovered, but evidently much exhausted, and\nbefore we had read to him the record, he said, \"There\nwas some very strong control at the sitting, it was so\npowerful that it has caused much pain in my arm, and\nfilled me with emotion, a distinct feeling of anger and\nindignation is left in myself. This is very odd as there\nis no cause for it at all.\" f\nDuring the sitting Mr. Robinson's hand was obviously\nused to move the traveller, whilst Mrs. T. Smith did all\nshe could to restrain its rapid and violent movement.\nAll those present were convinced that Mr. Robinson could\nnot see the alphabet, and was unaware of the messages\ncoming through. Moreover, none of us with our eyes\nopen, nor with the greatest effort, could spell out a\nsentence with the traveller approaching the rapidity with\nwhich these messages came through. Nor would any con-\ntinued practice, I venture to say, enable such abnormal\nspeed to be attained. This speed is not always attained,\nfor the results vary from time to time. In this par-\nticular instance the result impressed the sitters as much\nas the recorders. Mrs. T. Smith, after it was over, wrote\nto me :\n\u2014\" The sitting at which you and Lady Barrett\nwere present, was the most evidential we have so far\nexperienced ; we are quite convinced that there was some\n\flxxvi.] Evidence, of Super-normal Communications. 247\noutside influence, for the message could not have been due\nto our sub-consciousness.\"\nOn the other hand it is possible to interpret some of\nthe messages as dream-creations of the sub-concious self\nof the sitters. Thus Mrs. Travers Smith has sent me\nthe record of some recent sittings she had had with a\nMr. Dodds ; a startling and melodramatic story of an\nobsession came through, and also later on what purported\nto be a dream of which she had no recollection. The\nmessage went on : \u2014-\" I woke you with a terrible fright\nand sat- on your bed and laughed till I cried.\" Mrs.\nSmith says it then proceeded to describe her thoughts as\nthings coming one by one into the room like little fan-\ntastic beings. It was all very weird. Here is the record\nof one of these sittings a month or so ago :\nSitting, October 8, 1917.\nSitters\u2014Mrs. Travers Smith and Mr. Dodds.\nI am the body of your thoughts. I have grown from\nday to day since you were a child. I am getting taller\nand taller, now that your thoughts are so full and round.\nYou dream more than ever, and you always lived in your\ndreams. Soon the dream will be reality. [What do you\nmean 1] I mean I am a dim form made of a part of\nyou which is called imagination. The outward things are\nsharp and hard for you, and I keep you alive, the time\nis near when I shall be body and soul both. Dream on\nmy lady. Do not check your slumbering soul ; it would\nhave died long ago from sheer hunger and thirst, but that\nsweet dreams kept you alive and gave you strength to\nendure. Let me grow taller still :\n\u2014soon I shall have no\nlonger an entity of my own. . . . Forget the world's\nmisery, and let me grow until I am merged in you.\nAnother record Mrs. T. Smith sent me is of psycho-\nlogical interest. A control callinc; itself \" Eyan \" two years\nago annoyed the sitters by constantly intruding itself and\ncalled itself Mrs. Travers Smith's \"guide.\" At last\nMr. Lennox Eobinson, tired of this intrusion, drove him\naway persistently, and the control disappeared for a couple\n\f248 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.8. [part\nof years ;\nhowever, when Mr. Wakeman and Mrs. Travers\nSmith were recently sitting the following message from\nEyan unexpectedly came through with great dramatic\nforce.\nSitting, October 8, 1917.\nSitters\u2014Mrs. Travers Smith and Mr. Wakeman.\nNever again,\u2014the sun may shine the moon may shed\nher beams,\u2014but I am banished for evermore. Lennox\nthis is your doing. My revenge shall be to watch your\nsoul die for I am banished for evermore. Never again,\n\u2014\nthe summer may come with all its flowers and joys, the\nAutumn may moan, the Winter may lie white like a corpse\nin a shroud,\u2014but Lennox I shall have my revenge. Your\nsoul dies a lingering and horrible death, for I am banished\nfor evermore. Never again. The web of time is being\nwoven, but the shears are ready to cut the thread. The\nUniverse is throbbing but Lennox your soul is dead. You\nhave no soul for you have no love. Your soul is dead.\nNever again.\nHeaven is there, the paradise of the soul. Look, would\nyou not enter if you could. Hell is there. The soul's\ntorture. Would it not be better to feel the fire than be a\ndead thing ? No not for you is either bliss or torture,\nonly cold and numbness. You have no soul you wretched\nbeing, for you banished me for evermore.\n\u2014\nEyan.\nThe foregoing will illustrate the varied character of these\nautomatisms, a larger collection of which Mrs. Travers\nSmith intends to prepare for publication in book form.\nTheir explanation will afford interesting matter for future\npsychological enquiry. That the sub-conscious self of the\nsitters plays a considerable part is very probable, but\nunless we confer upon the sub-conscious or sub-liminal self\ntranscendental faculties this explanation fails to explain\nall. Thus clairvoyance is constantly exhibited when the\nsitters are carefully blindfolded. Eor instance, quite\nrecently, on a visit of Mrs. Travers Smith and Mr. Lennox\nRobinson to London, some friends were present, and the\nfollowing experiment was made to test the question of\n\flxxvi.] Evidence of Super-normal Communications. 249\nclairvoyance. In their normal state neither of the sitters\nis in the least clairvoyant.\nFirst Mrs. Travers Smith was carefully blindfolded, the\nletters of the ouija board were then re-arranged promiscuously,\nand we asked for a sentence to be spelt out, when she and\nMr. L. Robinson, who was not blindfolded, had their hands\non the traveller. Immediately the words \" New people\nagain \" were spelt out. The same sentence was repeated\nwhen Mr. L. Robinson was blindfolded carefully and not\nMrs. T. Smith, the letters being rearranged after each\nexperiment. Then both sitters were taken out of the rooni\nand most carefully and securely blindfolded, the letters\nentirely rearranged when they were out of the room, and\nwe asked for the same sentence to be repeated. \"New\npeople again \" was at once accurately spelt out. It is hardly\nnecessary to say that I satisfied myself the blindfolding\nprevented the sitters seeing the letters, and they assured\nme also they could see nothing. We must therefore assume\nthat the sub-liminal self of both sitters is clairvoyant, or\nthat some extraneous spirit guided, through their muscles,\nthe movement of the traveller.\nPsychical researchers need to be on their guard against\nwhat Bacon calls \" the idol of the market place,\" that is\nto say the error arising from the influence exercised by\nsome catch word or phrase. Having found a vera causa\nfor certain inexplicable psychical phenomena, many are\napt to think it a tota causa. The word telepathy has\nbeen abused in this way, even by some who formerly\nbelieved it had no existence. I venture to think we\nare in some danger to the slavery of the term \" the sub-\nliminal self,\" which is no more accepted as an explanation\nby official science than is that of an extraneous spirit\ninfluencing the medium. In connection with this, our\ndistinguished colleague, Dr. W. M'Dougall, F.R.S., has\ntruly said :\n\u2014\" The phrase, the sub-liminal self, may prove\ndetrimental to the efficiency of our Society, if we do not\nsternly resist the tendency to use it as a mere cloak for\nour ignorance whenever we arc confronted by inexplicable\nevents.\" 1\nl\nProc.

F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nThe words telepathy and telergy form part of the valuable\nterminology we owe to Mr. F. W. H. Myers. Telepathy\nis well known, and may be considered to have been\nestablished ; but though recognized as a new and impor-\ntant addition to our knowledge by all serious students\nof the subject, it has not yet been accepted as indisput-\nable by the general body of official science in any country.\nOne reason for this is that, like other psychical phenomena,\nit cannot be demonstrated at any given time or place\nwith the certainty of physical phenomena. Only by\nenlisting a wider range of interest and observation among\nscientific men and women can a more general acceptance\nof this fundamental fact of psychical research win its\nway into the accepted truths of science. \" The mistake\nof agnosticism,\" as Mr. Lowes Dickinson has truly re-\nmarked, \" has been that it has said not merely, '\nI do\nnot know,' but '\nI will not consider.' Such a position\nis hampering not only to life but to truth. For the\nimpulse to truth is desire, and all discoveries are prompted\nby hope and by faith.\" 1\nMr. Myers has defined telepathy as \" The communication\nof impressions of any kind from one mind to another\nindependently of the recognised channels of sense.\" Tele-\npathy therefore includes and extends the term \" thought-\ntransference,\" a word originally employed to denote those\nnovel phenomena, the result of experiments at short\n1\nReligion and Criticism, a Forecast, p. xi, by G. Lowes Dickinson (Brimley\n&Co.).\n\f252 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.B.S. [part\ndistances, which were first brought under the notice of\nscience by the present writer some forty-one years ago.\nI will return to the discussion of telepathy presently,\nbut before doing so let us try to get at the meaning\nof the much less familiar term telergy.\nIn the valuable Index of the publications of our Society,\nwhich already extends over two volumes, no reference\nwhatever is made to the word telergy. This is an\nomission, for it is found in our Proceedings, Vol. VI.\n(1890), p. 320, where Mr. Myers, in a paper on Phantasms\nof the Dead, says :\n*'\nWhen we come to telergy\u2014the power of propagating\ninfluences or phantasms at a distance,\u2014\u2022 . . . The crisis\nwhich facilitated telergic action was not necessarily a\nmoment of conscious excitement or strain. Quite other-\nwise, for it was proved that the '\nagent ' at the moment\nof the apparition was often asleep or fainting or in a\nstate of coma. ... It would thus be nearer the truth\nto say that telergic action varies inversely, than that\nit varies directly with the observable activity of the\nnervous system or of the conscious mind.\"\nThe word telergy strictly means force or energy acting\nafar, or at a distance from its source ; hence in the\nGlossary of Terms used in Psychical Research which Mr.\nMyers compiled and published in our Proceedings, Vol. XII.,\np. 174, he defines telergy as follows :\n\" A name for a hypothetical force, or mode of action,\nconcerned with the conveyance of telepathic impressions,\nand perhaps with other supernormal operations.\"\nAs time went on a somewhat different and more\nrestricted meaning was given to telergy, for in the glossary\nprefixed to his magnum opus on Human Personality,\nMyers defines telergy as follows :\n\" The force exercised by\nthe mind of an agent in impressing a percipient,\u2014in-\nvolving a direct influence of an extraneous spirit on the\nbrain or organism of the percipient.\"\nIn his discussion of telergy in Vol. II. of Human\nPersonality, Myers uses the term in a more general sense\nthan that given in the above definition. Thus on p. 526\nhe writes :\n\fLXXVI.] Note on Telepathy and Telergy. 253\n\" That law [that spirits should influence men] is the\ndirect transmission of thought and emotion from mind\nto mind, and the telergy\u2014to use here a word more active\nin its connotation than telepathy\u2014the telergy by which\nthis transmission is effected, may be as universally diffused\nin the metatherial world as heat in the material.\" Again,\non p. 197, speaking of telepathy as involving two factors,\nMyers says :\n\" The percipient's mind must somehow receive the\ntelepathic impression ; \u2014and to this reception we can\nassign no definite physical correlative ;\n\u2014and also the\npercipient's motor or sensory centres must receive an\nexcitation :\n\u2014which excitation may be communicated, for\naught we know, either by his own mind in the ordinary\nway, or by the agent's mind in some direct way,\n\u2014\nwhich I may call telergic, thus giving a more precise\nsense to a word which I long ago suggested as a kind\nof correlative to telepathic. That is to say, there may\neven in these apparently simple cases be first a trans-\nmission from agent to percipient in the spiritual world,\nand then an action on the percipient's physical brain\nof the same type as spirit-possession. This action on\nthe physical brain may be due either to the percipient's\nown spirit, or subliminal self, or else directly to the\nagent's spirit.\"\nHere Myers (recognizing as elsewhere, that telepathy\nis a psychical and not a mechanical process,) gives an\nalternative mode by which the telepathic action on the\npercipient's brain may be made to reveal itself, and\napparently would keep the word telergic to a direct\naction of the agent's mind or spirit (he uses these words\nas synonymous) on the percipient's brain. This view\nhe states more definitely on p. 522, where he refers\nagain to the two possible modes by which telepathy\nmay influence the percipient's brain :\n\" Shall we say\nthat the spirit of the agent affects the spirit of the\npercipient, and thus the spirit of the percipient influences\nhis own brain ? Or shall we say that the agent's spirit\ndirectly influences the percipient's brain in like manner\nas it influenced his own ? There may seem little to\n\f254 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nchoose between two such unprovable conceptions. Yet . . .\nI think that the second alternative should provisionally not\nbe excluded. ... It is certainly simpler to suppose\nthat here also the agent's spirit is directly affecting the\npercipient's brain,\u2014not needing, so to say, to invite\nthe percipient's own spirit to accomplish that task.\"\nFrom this it would appear that Myers was disposed\nto regard the reception and manifestation of all tele-\npathic influence as more simply explicable by the agent's\nspirit directly affecting the percipient's brain. \" On\nthis view,\" he says in the next paragraph, \" we shall\nhave an intelligible series\u2014though a series advancing by\nleaps and bounds\u2014to represent the achievements of Will,\nas it shakes itself free from the limitations which are\nbut shadows as contrasted with its own reality. In\nthe first place we have hyperboulia ; \u2014the extension of\nthe Will's power over tissues in the organism which\nits mandates have ordinarily failed to reach. In the\nsecond place we have telergy ; \u2014the extension of its power\nover the brain molecules of an organism other than\nthat with which it is primarily in connection. And\nin the third place we shall have '\ntelekinesis '\nand the\nlike ;\u2014a group of phenomena involving control over\ninorganic matter, and over organic matter both within\nand without its own organism.\"\nEarlier in the same volume (Human Personality,\nVol. II., p. 204) Myers points out that the mystery\nof psycho-physical interaction, whilst inexplicable, occurs\nin our ordinary life, where our own spirits affect our\nown bodies and are the standing examples of spirit\naffecting matter. He then makes his own position clear\nin the following sentence :\n\" It may not always be true even in the case of sensory\nautomatisms that the distant spirit has made a suggestion\nmerely to the percipient's spirit which the percipient's\nown spirit carries out ; and in motor automatisms, as\nthey develop into 'possession, there are indications, as\nI have already pointed out, that the influence of the\nagent's spirit is telergic rather than telepathic, and that\nwe have extraneous spirits influencing the human brain\n\flxxvi.] Note on Telepathy and Tclergy. 255\nor organism. That is to say, they are producing move-\nments in matter ; \u2014even though that matter be organized\nmatter and those movements molecular.\"\nWe thus arrive at the definition of telergy given in\nthe glossary to Human Personality, which I have already\nquoted. Certainly one of the cases of motor automatism\ngiven in the preceding paper seems to me a case where\ntelepathy merges into telergy. Any one who has been\npresent at the sittings when the control purporting to\nbe Hugh Lane violently manifested, completely sub-\nmerging the personality of the automatist, would compare\nit to a case of possession. It was not mere telepathy,\nbut a distinct psychical invasion of some extraneous\npower or personality ; and with our present knowledge,\nit is, in my opinion, simpler to assume here telergic\naction rather than confer on the automatist hypothetical\ntranscendental powers of muscular action and clairvoyance.\nNevertheless others, whose opinion is entitled to great\nweight, do not take this view, and dispute that any\nvalid evidence has been adduced on behalf of telergy.\nThus in a foot-note {Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXVIII., p. 320) to\nher valuable monograph \" On the Psychology of Mrs.\nPiper's Trance-Phenomena,\" Mrs. H. Sidgwick states\nthat whilst not dogmatically affirming that \" no influence\nof a telergic kind can ever be exercised by an external\nmind,\n\u2014\ni.e. that an external mind can never affect our\nnervous system in the same way our own mind does,\n\u2014\nI think there is practically no evidence for it at present.\"\nThis statement is however somewhat modified in a later\nremark by Mrs. Sidgwick, viz. :\n\" It is even possible\nthat telepathy and telergy may merge into each other.\"\nIn any case the existence of telergy can only be an\ninference, as it is incapable of being experimentally proved.\nObviously the only definite proof of the direct action\nof an extraneous spirit on the molecules of the brain\nwould be to evoke some response from a corpse, for\nwhen the percipient is merely unconscious or entranced,\nhis subliminal life is not extinct, and may be in fact\nmore accessible to a telepathic impact.\nThis lengthy discussion of the meaning of telergy may\nR\n\f256 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nbe useful in removing misconception and ambiguity,\nthough it adds nothing to the more important question\nof evidence on its behalf.\nTurning to the subject of telepathy, it seems also\ndesirable to remove some misconceptions which have arisen.\nThe words \" agent \" and \" percipient,\" used in the\nReports of the Committee on Thought-Transference pub-\nlished in the first two or three volumes of the Proceedings\nof the S.P.R., are apt to be misleading. They convey the\nidea that the agent, or transmitter, must be actively and\nenergetically striving to communicate an impression from\nhis mind to the passive' percipient, like a vigorous\nelectrical transmitter in wireless telegraphy. Now there\nis no valid evidence to indicate that telepathy depends\nfor its success on the \" agent \" concentrating his mind\nupon some word or idea and energetically striving to\ntransmit it. On the contrary, as the first case in the\npreceding paper shows, the agent may be asleep and\nthe conscious mind for the time in abeyance. As Mr.\nMyers has remarked about telergy, in the passage quoted\n(p. 252), it would be nearer the truth to say that telepathic\naction varies inversely rather than directly to the\nobserved mental activity of the agent or percipient.\nIt seems highly probable that telepathy, like many\npsychical phenomena, is the operation of the sub-conscious\nor subliminal self of the so-called agent, which in some\nunknown way influences the sub-conscious self of the\nautomatist or percipient, and it is possible that a vigorous\nconscious activity of mind may often be more or less\ninimical to success. The word \" agent,\" as used for\nthe transmitter, must therefore be taken to mean the\nconscious or unconscious originating source of the impres-\nsion conveyed.\nA much more difficult question is the mode of trans-\nmission of telepathy. No doubt in many minds the\nfirst conception of thought-transference was a quasi-\nmechanical transmission of brain waves through space.\nThe well-known phenomenon of resonance in physics\nsupported this idea. A tuning-fork when struck will\ncause another tuning-fork, in exact unison, to respond,\n\fLXXVI.] Note on Telepathy and Telergy. 257\neven though they may be some distance apart. The\nresonance of a sensitive flame (a tall jet of gas) is still\nmore remarkable ; it will shorten nearly a foot in response\nto a note of the proper pitch 50 or more feet distant.1\nMoreover, it can respond to vibrations of the air too rapid\nfor the ear to perceive.2\nIn radio-, or wireless telegraphy,\nwe have the resonance to undulations of the ether ex-\ntending over thousands of miles. Whilst the transmission\nof intelligence by radio-telegraphy rendered telepathy less\nincredible to the public, it also supported the popular\nview that a somewhat analogous mode of transmission\noccurred in the two cases. This however is highly\nimprobable ; albeit some years ago Sir W. Crookes, in\nhis Presidential Address to our Society (Vol. XII., p. 352),\nmade a provisional suggestion that very high frequency\nvibrations [of the molecules of the brain] might generate\nminute ethereal waves and be the mode of telepathic\ntransmission. Another high authority. Dr. W. M'Dougall,\nin his great work Body and Mind, does not altogether\ndismiss the idea of brain-waves as a possible explanation\nof telepathy through short distances.\nIt is therefore worth while to state the reasons\nwhy telepathy cannot be explained by any known\nmethod of mechanical transmission of '\nbrain-waves '\nthrough\nthe ether, or other forms of radiant physical action.\n\" Its laws,\" as Myers has remarked, \" are not cognate to\nthe known laws of the material world. It is a trans-\nference, not of a pattern of vibrations, but of a knowledge,\nan impulse, which seems to implant itself in the perci-\npient's mind like a living thing \" (Op. ext. p. 521). In\nsupport of this psychical view I may be permitted to\nquote an extract from an article of mine in the Contem-\nporary Review for February, 1918 :\n\"All radiant forces, such as light, heat, gravitation, etc.,\nwhen freely diffused through space diminish in intensity\nas the square of the distance increases between the source\nand the receiver, if no absorbing medium intervenes. At\na thousand feet apart the intensity is a million times less\n1\nPhilosophical Magazine, March, 1867, Paper by W. F. B.\n2\nNature, May 3, 1877 : Note by W. F. B.\nr2\n\f258 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nthan at one foot apart. To transmit a wireless message\nacross the Atlantic therefore requires a very powerful\nsource of electric waves and a very sensitive receiver.\nNow there are well attested cases of telepathy occurring\nbetween individuals, not only thousands of feet apart, but\nthousands of miles asunder\u2014if apparitions at or near the\ntime of death are due to a telepathic impression, as seems\nprobable\u2014a phantasm being projected from the mind of\nthe percipient. Yet, in such cases, there was no exhaus-\ntion, no exertion even, on the part of the unconscious\nsource of these imaginary brain waves.\nIt is therefore highly improbable that telepathy is trans-\nmitted by waves radiating in every direction, like light\nfrom a candle. Nor can we conceive of unwritten or\nunspoken thought being carried by a messenger, or sent\nthrough a conduit, or fired like a bullet at a target.\nMoreover, in telepathy ideas and feelings, more frequently\nthan exact words, impress the percipient. There is\nabundant evidence that emotions and sensations such as\npain, taste, etc., experienced by one person are simul-\ntaneously felt by a distant percipient, under conditions\nthat exclude the possibility of fraud or any verbal com-\nmunication.1\nThe remarkable fact is also coming to light,\nthat telepathy may not be ultimately due to any conscious\nand voluntary operation of the mind, either in the\noriginating or receiving personality, such as occurs in the\nordinary operation of speech or writing.\nTelepathy, then, cannot be explained by a process of\nmechanical transmission. It appears to be a case of\n'\naction at a distance.' But physicists do not admit\naction at a distance as an ultimate fact, although the\nattracting influence of one body upon another throughout\nthe realms of space appears to be such an action. Gravi-\ntation, however, is not likely to be an exception to other\nphysical forces, though we may have to wait a long time\n1\nMr. Gerald Balfour has also pointed out (Proc. S. P. R., vol. XXVI. , p. 363) that\nwhilst the transmission of wireless telepathy depends on the use of symbols there\nis good reason to believe telepathy in many cases is the direct communication of\nmeanings. There is also, he remarks, something like a selective action in\ntelepathy, a power on the part of the agent to direct the communication to a\nparticular person and no other.\n\fLXXVI.] Note on Telepathy and Telergy. 259\nfor its satisfactory explanation. Telepathy and gravitation\nare only alike in this, that at present we are ignorant\nhow two different masses, and how two different minds,\nat a distance apart, can transmit their influence. The two\noperations are in wholly different categories\u2014one belongs\nto the physical order, the other to the psychical order.\nIt may be, as my friend Mr. F. C. Constable suggested,\nin his work Persoriality and Telepathy, that we may find\nin telepathy evidence of the direct operation of a tran-\nscendental part of our being which is not conditioned in\nmatter or space. In any case, telepathy and its implica-\ntions will afford a profound and fruitful subject of psycho-\nlogical discussion in the near future.\"\n\" Telepathy,\" as Mrs. Henry Sidgwick has remarked, \" if a\npurely psychical process\u2014and the reasons for thinking it\nis so increase\u2014indicates that the mind can work inde-\npendently of the body, and thus adds to the probability\nthat it can survive it.\" 1\nFor my own part I am convinced\nthat telepathy is a purely psychical process, and if this be\nso it is difficult to conceive how an idea or impression can\nbe telepathically conveyed except by the direct influence\nof the transmitting mind on that of the percipient ; an\noperation which suggests an excursive action of the mind,\nor soul, or sub-liminal self ; if indeed we can speak of\nexcursive action in a process which is probably independent\nboth of matter and of space. A \" telepathic impact\n\"\nfrom some distant mind would thus appear to be a\npsychical impact, for this impact, to quote Myers again\n(op. cii. p. 521), \"is no blunt shock. It may be sudden;\nbut it may also be persistent ; it may sometimes be\noverwhelming, but it can be insinuating too. It is\nnot a bolt discharged and done with ; it is a vital\ninfluence at work on the percipient's subhminal self.\"\nHence the distinction between this and a psychical invasion\nof the percipient by an extraneous mind, seems (in our\nignorance of the modus operandi) to be only a question\nof the degree of interpenetrating influence or control\nwhich the extraneous mind or spirit can gain over the\nreceptive organism.

Pp. xxiv, 641.\nPsychical Research having at length got itself endowed academi-\ncally, by a spiritualist and brother of the late Senator Stan-\nford, the authorities of Leland Stanford Junior University\nare evidently determined to prove that they are making a\ngood use of the endowment given them, and are worthy of further\nfavours. Hence this enormous volume. Hence also a good\ndeal of padding in it, the three prefaces, the library catalogue\nof 72 pages, the abundant citations and summaries of opinions,\nwhich occupy 30 pages before the first experiments are reached ;\nthough it should be admitted that the summaries of the\npast history of the subject are sometimes distinctly convenient.\nThe work is evidently intended to impress the world by\nits sheer weight (3 lbs. 3J oz. avoirdupois), and especially\nthe academic world. It is hardly meant to be read, at all\nevents by the general public, to judge by the lengthiness\nand diffuseness of its style, and the academic jargon in which\nit is written. But this is all the more reason for summarizing\nits findings, for drawing attention to the important material\nit contains, and for discussing its value. For after subtracting\nthe padding, six plates, and nearly a hundred pages of tables\nand '\ncurves,' there still remain over 400 pages of reports\non experiments, which demand consideration.\n\f262 F. G. S. Schiller. [part\nThe first subject to be investigated was Thought Trans-\nference without contact (Part L). Pages 31-47 report experi-\nments with guessing and Lotto Block Numbers, with Dr. Coover\nas the '\nexperimenter '\n(\n= ' Agent ') and a student of psychology\nas the 'reagent' ( = '\nPercipient '). The results were in general\nnegative, showing no greater amount of success than could\nbe ascribed to chance, and no correlation between the reagent's\nsubjective feeling of certainty and the actual success.\nPages 48-143 deal with the guessing of Playing Cards (court\ncards omitted). Here the participators were numerous,\nnumbering over 200, and may probably be regarded as a\n'\nfair sample ' of the Californian student population, so that\nthe experiments constituted a good test of the hypothesis\nthat the capacity for receiving telepathic impressions is faintly\ndiffused throughout the human race. The method was to\nset 100 pairs of experimenters each to do a' series of 100\nexperiments, in half of which (roughly) the agent knew the\ncard and tried to transfer his knowledge, while in the other\nhalf he did not look at it until the reagent had made his\nguess. The agent determined whether a regular or a '\ncontrol\n'\nexperiment should be tried by a throw of dice, and apparently\n(though this is not distinctly stated) the reagent never knew\nwhich it was. Nor were the results inspected until the series\nwas completed. The results taken in bulk were again negative\nin the aggregate, and so did not support the belief in faint\ndegrees of telepathy. 5135 '\ncard-imaged '\nexperiments, in\nwhich a transfer was attempted, yielded 153 correct guesses\nof the card and 538 of the number, though not of the suit,\nthe most probable numbers ascribable to chance being 128 and\n513. The 4865 '\ncontrol '\nexperiments (which were supposed to\nbe pure guesses) yielded 488 correct Numbers, and 141 wholly\ncorrect, the '\nprobable '\nnumbers being 486 and 122. There\nwas consequently a (slight) excess over the most '\nprobable\n'\nnumber in both series, and a slight difference in favour of\nthe '\nexperiments,' in which telepathy might conceivably be\noperative ; but it was not sufficient to warrant any inference\nto the reality of telepathy, as it was not above the limits of\nchance variation. Thus the complete successes among the '\npure\nguesses '\nvaried between 7 and 23 per 1000 (the probable\nnumber being 12J), while those among the '\nexperiments\n'\n\fLXXVI.] Review. 263\nvaried between 11 and 20 ; so that one series of a thousand\n'\npure guesses '\nmight actually have been taken as better\nproof of telepathy than any series of '\nexperiments.'\nWhen, however, we come to test the hypothesis that tele-\npathy occurs in certain (rare) subjects, the interpretation of\nthese figures is by no means as clear. For it then becomes\nlegitimate to argue that some only of the '\nreagents '\nhad\nfaint telepathic capacity, and to select their answers for\nseparate analysis. Hence we may select 14 reagents (Nos. 1,\n25, 26, 30, 32, 40, 42, 49, 59, 63, 64, 66, 78 and 97)\nand tabulate their results. It then appears that in 711\nexperiments they got 119 Numbers right and scored 54 '\ncom-\nplete successes.' The '\nprobable ' numbers are respectively\n71 and 18. There was therefore a considerable excess over\nthe ordinary chance distribution. But was it too great to be\nascribed to chance, and must it be attributed to an unknown\ncause ('telepathy')? Dr. Coover goes fully into the methods\nof answering this question by the calculus of probabilities,\nthough he only applies them to his aggregate results.\nHis tables appear to show (p. 92) that if in a series of\n700 guesses 5 per cent, are complete successes, and 14*8 per\ncent, get the Numbers right, the excess above the '\nprobable\n'\nnumber becomes significant of something beyond chance, and\nof course the larger the number of guesses the smaller becomes\nthe excess above the '\nprobable ' number which suffices to\nestablish this. Now in the set of reagents selected as\npossibly telepathic, the percentage of complete successes is\nactually 7-\n6, and of '\nNumbers right '\n16- 73. This is on the\nface of it a considerable excess, and if the method of reasoning\nis sound, would appear to prove some degree of telepathy\nin the 14 selected reagents.\nBut it will no doubt be objected that some of the series\nof '\npure guesses ' would show similar results if selected in\nthis fashion. To test this suggestion let us take all those\nseries of piire guesses which scored 3 or more '\ncomplete\nsuccesses.' They, too, happen to be 14 (Nos. 1, 2, 17, 25,\n32, 51, 52, 64, 66, 71, 76, 93, 99, 100), and they add up\nto a somewhat smaller number, viz. 690. Out of these 49\nwere complete successes, and 91 got the numbers right. The\nresulting percentages are 7'1 and 13\" 18, which is appreciably\n\f264 F. CL 8. Schiller. [part\nlower than 7'6 and 1673, though higher, as regards complete\nsuccesses, than is regarded as compatible with pure chance,\nthe highest percentages so compatible being 51 and 15.\nWe must next notice that of the two sets of 14 best series\nthe surprisingly large number of 5 are common to the '\nexperi-\nments '\nand the 'pure guesses.' 1\nIn these 5 (Nos. 1, 25, 32,\n64, and 66) 22 complete successes (8\n-\n46 per cent.) and 41\ncorrect numbers (15\n-\n77 per cent.) were scored in 260 answers.\nSubtracting these, for reasons to be presently explained,\n27 complete successes and 50 correct numbers remain in\n430 answers. The percentages then work out at 6-28 and\n11-63, which compare with 5-\n81 and 164 for the highest\npercentage compatible with chance in 400 answers. There\nis still an excess of complete successes, but its significance\nis evidently much reduced. The success of the five who\nsucceeded alike as experimenters and as guessers, however,\nremains a problem.\nOn this problem we may shed some light by combining\nthe '\npure guesses '\nand the '\nexperiments ' in the five good\nseries. We then get 41 complete successes and 86 correct\nnumbers, in a total of 500. The percentages work out at\n8 '2 and 17 2, and are very markedly higher than the maxima\nattributable to chance according to Dr. Coover, viz. 5-\n46\nand 15-7.\nThese figures therefore distinctly point to some source of\nTightness beyond chance in these cases. As it occurs in the\n'\npure guesses '\nas well as in the '\nexperiments,' it cannot\nbe of the nature of conscious thought-transference. But\nmay it not be due to a sort of '\nlucidity ' or clairvoyance\nin the '\nreagent '\n? This possibility had long ago presented\nitself to my mind in connexion with some card-guessing\n1\nHow curious this correlation is may be shown by comparing the worst\nseries of 'experiments' and 'pure guesses.' Twenty series of 'experiments'\nand 23 of '\npure guesses ' did not score a single complete success. Among\n1090 answers 82 '\nguesses ' got the Number right (against a '\nprobable ' 109\nand 27 'complete successes'); among 1026 answers 68 'experiments' got the\nNumber right (against a 'probable' 103 and 26 'complete successes'). But\nonly 3 of the worst series were common to the 1\nguesses' and the 'experiments,'\nand in general no correlation could be traced between the bad series. In the\nbad 'experiments' the 'guesses' were about the 'probable' number, while\nin the bad '\nguesses ' the corresponding '\nexperiments '\nwere above the average\n(38 instead of 30 '\ncomplete successes,' and 131 instead of 121 'Numbers right').\n\fLXXVI.] Review. 265\nexperiments by means of automatic writing made in 1886,\nand recorded in Proc, Vol. IV. p. 220. In this case a dispute\narose as to whether the results attained could be ascribed\nto chance, the automatist (my brother) maintaining that\nthey could ; so to test the matter we all embarked on series\nof 64 '\npure guesses.' The results were curious. For while\nthe other guessers got results in accordance with probability,\nthe automatist, though he never did quite so well as with\nplanchette, invariably scored 4-6 successes in his series of 64\n(with a full pack).\nOf course the long arm of coincidence may cover this also,\nfor no series, however improbable, can ever be proved to\nbe incompatible with chance ; but Dr. Coover is hardly entitled\nto deduce from his data that \" no trace of an objective thought-\ntransference is found as a capacity enjoyed in perceptible\nmeasure by any of the individual normal reagents \"\n(p. 124).\nHe should recognize not only, as he does (p. 65), that his\n'\ncontrol '\nexperiments assumed the non-existence of any\n'\nlucidity,' but also that this may have been wrong, and that\nthey may not have been '\npure guesses,' and endeavour to\nexperiment further with the abnormal coincidence of good\n'\nguessers '\nand good '\nexperimenters.' If the excess of right\nanswers continues (with these subjects), he will be able\nto establish the existence of telepathy on a statistical basis.\nExperiments with these five good '\nreagents '\nwould appear on the\nevidence to be more promising than with the 10 '\npsychics,'\nwhose 530 '\nexperiments '\nonly showed a comparatively slight\nexcess over probability, and whose '\nguesses '\ngave no hint\nof lucidity.\nThe '\nfeeling of being stared at '\nand the supposed power\nof '\nwilling people to turn round ' was next investigated.\nIt was found (by questionnaire) that these beliefs were enter-\ntained by 77 and 59 per cent, of the students in the psycho-\nlogy classes, and the experimenters were chosen from the\nbelievers. The results of 1000 experiments were negative.\nWhen the believers objected that the laboratory conditions\ndiffered too much from those of real life, another 1000 experi-\nments were made in which the subjects were not told they\nwere to be stared at but only had to '\nintrospect '\n; but in\nno case was the feeling of being stared at recorded.

It is then argued that mental habits must tend\nto increase the number of '\nright '\ncases in thought-transference\nexperiments. This may be admitted as regards experiments\nwith ordinary diagrams, in which there is sure to be a pre-\nponderance of simple geometrical forms, and it may of course\noccur, also, if there is a coincidence between the number-habits\nof any pair of percipients and agents ; but (in cases where\nthere is no reason\u2014such as the judges had\u2014to give a pre-\nference to round numbers) we must also recognize the possi-\nbility that two such habits may clash and so reduce the\nnumber of successes ; while with large masses of experimenters\nit may fairly be assumed that these contrary influences will\ncancel out without appreciably vitiating the results.\nPart IV., pp. 367-408, reports experiments in Sound Assimila-\ntion which were designed to test the trustworthiness of the\nidentification of articulate sounds, and the sceptical explanation\nthat when '\nspeakers with tongues ' are heard to be speaking\nto each man in his own language, this interpretation proceeds\nfrom the mind of the hearer.

A sceptic, who\nwould net believe that the results could be so bad, was\ninvited to dictate a list to the dictaphone himself, and immedi-\nately afterwards to record what he heard, only got 37 per\ncent, correct, and even an expert stenographer could only\nget 42 per cent. It was further shown that this incorrectness\nwas not due to a failure to hear the sounds themselves, but\nto their being heard as other sounds. This was proved by\ndictating a text which '\nsimulated ' an English sentence\nwhich made sense, though it did not actually contain the sound\nit mimicked in a single instance. Half of the sounds heard\nwere transformed into the corresponding English sounds, while\nwhen the recorders were simultaneously looking at the English\ntext simulated less than 10 per cent, of the dictaphone sounds\nwere thought to be wrong, and \" 90 per cent, came true\nto the English text\u2014were heard as other sounds.\" It is\nobvious that where suggestion or emotion guides the interpreta-\ntions of the senses the gravest errors may thus be committed\nin perfectly good faith, and perception be falsified to an\nenormous extent. But of course this principle cuts both\nways. It is not merely abnormal perceptions that are falsified\nby expectation and suggestion. Normal perception comes\nunder the law even more plainly. It cannot but be an\ninterpretation of what is there, in the light of personal and\nracial experience and social convention. And so it may\nconceivably be the '\nabnormal '\nand '\nunstable ' alone who\nare sufficiently emancipated from the idola tribus and unbiassed\nto perceive things as they really are, and not as they are\nconventionally supposed to be.\nPart V. consists of contributions by Prof. Lillien J. Martin.\nThe first explains that a supposed prophecy of the great\nCalifornia earthquake of 1906, on a poster connected with\nan undergraduate skit in 1903 showing the Stanford University\nMemorial Arch in ruins, was really based on a geological\nlecture about the earthquake rift running through California.\nThen follows a study of ghost-seeing, which is attributed\nto the power of projecting visual images. The interpretation\n\f268 F. C. S. Schiller. [PAET\nis not very convincing, but the stories of 2 of the 4 seers\nare interesting. Prof. Martin also tabulates the answers\ngiven by her classes in psychology in 1912-6 to the Society's\nquestionnaire about hallucinations, and remarks that hallucina-\ntions appear to be much commoner among Stanford students\nthan among the English answers,1\nand also that auditory\nhallucinations were much commoner (more than 3 times) than\nvisual, whereas in the English results visual hallucinations\nare commoner (nearly twice as common, crediting multiple\nhallucinations to each of the senses affected). This she attri-\nbutes conjecturally to an omission of many simple auditory\nhallucinations from the English Report. But even if we\nadded on a conjectural 3000 unrecorded auditory hallucinations\nto bring their ratio up to the Stanford students' level the\n17,000 answers of the British census would only show about\n28 per cent, who had experienced hallucinations, whereas\nat Stanford 256 out of 591 answers were affirmative, i.e.\n43 per cent. Evidently the breezy Westerner is more suscep-\ntible to the things which aren't there than the stolid Britisher.\nIt would be interesting to learn whether there is any marked\nsex-difference, but Prof. Martin's table is silent about this.\nLastly Prof. Martin gives in '\nAn Experimental Study of\nthe Subconscious '\na brief account of some attempts to get\nautomatic writing, and a comparison of the value of this\nmethod of exploring the subconscious with one she prefers,\nthe '\nimage '\nmethod. It contains nothing of special interest,\nsave perhaps the story of the girl (p. 426) who gave herself\naway by repeatedly intruding into her English essays the\nname of a football hero she admired.\nAmong the Appendices '\nC '\nis important as an elaborate\ncriticism of the '\nproof '\nof telepathy put forward in the\nexperiments of the S.P.R. The early Creery experiments\nare regarded as utterly vitiated by the subsequent confessions\nof fraud, while Mr. D. Blackburn's revelations in 1911 about\nthe Smith-Blackburn experiments of 1882 are fully discussed.\nDr. Coover's verdict on the whole case is (p. 499) that \" the\nbest of the evidence . . . which occupied first place in the\nSociety's authoritative Proceedings has suffered a fatal decline.\nThe Committee showed caution in guarding against fraud\n!Cf. Proc. Vol. X.\n\fLXXVI.] Review. 269\nand error, and expressed their belief that both had been\neliminated. Contemporaneous critics pointed out the possible\noperation of both, and challenged the trustworthiness of\nthe results. Collusion was later confessed by one or more\nof the parties to the experiments in both the principal series.\nAs against the presumption of false confession, or a segregation\nof untainted results, there remains in the published records\nof both series of experiments internal evidence of the use\nof a code.\" Also (p. 500) the general conduct of the investiga-\ntion casts discredit upon the conclusions drawn. Appeal\nwas constantly made for the assistance of incompetent investi-\ngators, winch besides facilitating the accumulation of results\nwhich must be entirely untrustworthy through gross error\nin procedure and records, encouraged skilled collusionists to\nmatch wits with the Society's representatives in a contest\nso unequal that positive results of a spurious character were\ninsured.\" The Society is also accused of suppressing and\ndeclining to publish \" a very considerable amount of negative\nresults.\" So \" the Society, on account of its fiascoes and\npersistent lack of psychological vision, is immeasurably farther\nfrom its goal to-day than it was in 1886, in its effort to\nproduce proof of thought-transference.\" In spite of this\nindictment, Dr. Coover does not think that the Society \" has\nfailed to justify its existence,\" for \" it has been of great service\nto mankind, particularly in helping it to rid itself of fraud\nand delusion \" (p. 501). The real moral of its failures is\nthat \" technical experience in experimental psychology is requisite\nboth for the control of the experiments and for the interpretation\nof the results.\" Hence the only hope for the Society lies\n\" in cooperating with a psychological laboratory \" (p. 502).\nThis contention about the value of laboratory apparatus\nin overcoming the difficulties which the dark seance offers\nto the scientific investigator is signally illustrated in Appendix\nD, which narrates how a '\nTrumpet-Medium's ' phenomena\nwere traced to their source by quite simple apparatus recording\nher respiration and pulse. The exposure (or, as Dr. Coover\nprefers to call it, '\nexpose ') was overwhelming, and is only\nenhanced by the moderation of the phrasing which ironically\nprofesses to leave the question open for a future investigation\n(which was of course refused by the medium) and by trans-\n\f270 F. C. 8. Schiller. [part\nscribing the very inadequate protests of those members of\nthe investigating Committee of the California Psychical Research\nSociety who were unwilling to accept Dr Coover's demonstra-\ntion. He may be said to have shown conclusively that in\nthe trial of wits between the fraudulent medium and the scientist\nthe victory should always rest with the latter, if he will\nonly take the trouble to devise suitable apparatus.\nFrom this conclusion, however, a number of morals may\nbe drawn. For fraudulent mediums the moral is that they\nshould be extremely careful and that their whole business\nis threatened with extinction, alike whether they refuse the\ntest by apparatus or prefer to be detected, quietly and without\na row, by the inexorable tracing of a kymograph. For the\nscientist who refuses to interest himself in psychical research\non the plea that the conditions do not lend themselves to\nscientific investigation, the moral should be that this excuse\nhas broken down, and that he can no longer absolve himself\nfrom the social duty of educating the public by routing popular\nsuperstition. For the psychical researcher, lastly, the moral\nplainly is that he should modernize his equipment, provide\nhimself with a specially constructed laboratory, and no longer\ntrust to his unaided senses and sheer intelligence. It may\nbe suggested also that the present time, when there are so\nmany millions who have been cruelly and abnormally bereaved\nand deprived of those in whom their hopes were centred,\nwhen there is such keen dissatisfaction with the evasive\nplatitudes of conventional creeds, by which all societies have\nfrom time immemorial cheated the longing of the freshly-\nwounded human heart not to be totally severed from those\nit loved, and when nevertheless the critical spirit is strong\nenough in many not to rest content with consoling deceptions,\naffords a unique opportunity for obtaining a favourable response\nto an appeal for the means to establish and equip a Psychical\nResearch Laboratory, in which all the alleged phenomena\nmay be systematically, fairly, and sympathetically examined.\nSuch an appeal should be launched by our Society, which\nhas been in existence long enough to have become widely\nknown and has won public confidence by its fair-mindedness,\nprudence and candour, and has made comparatively few\nmistakes. For it is by this time clear that the world will\n\fLXXVI.] Bevieiv. 271\nnot accept the verdict either of those who will believe anything\nor of those who will believe nothing. Both the spiritists,\non the one side, and the experimental psychologists on\nthe other, have (as a body) shown themselves to be too\nbitterly biassed. The time is ripe for a serious investigation\nwhich prejudges no question, and is biassed only in favour\nof the truth, however strange and unacceptable it may prove\nto be.\nEven supposing, however, that our Society had obtained\nits laboratory and the men to man it, we should be prepared\nto find that the question could not be easily or rapidly settled.\nFor it is one of those questions which inevitably arouse party\nspirit, and neither party is ever convinced as a whole, though\nindividuals may pass from one side to the other. To expect\nthe question of another world to be settled one way or the\nother by the ordinary methods of scientific investigation\nwould be as quixotic as to expect to decide in this way\nwhether the conservative party or the liberal was scientifically\nright. And for the same reason. It may confidently be\npredicted that if the investigation should yield entirely, or\npredominantly, negative results, like Dr. Coover's, the believers\nwill at most drop such parts of their case as have been too\nobviously exploded, while clinging to the rest with an intenser\naffection. Or, more probably, they will repudiate the methods,\nand impugn the fairness, of the investigators. If, on the\nother hand, there should result a report favourable to the\nclaims of a subject which is viewed with intense repugnance\n(for reasons which are by no means all creditable or avowed)\nby a large and influential section of human opinion, it will\nas certainly be alleged that the investigators were dishonest\nor incapable and deceived by undetected sources of error,\nwhich their critics may not even trouble to specifj*. If\nthe results should lie between these two extremes, the present\nunsatisfactory \"state of affairs will continue, and it will depend\non every man's taste and temper how much or little he\nchooses to believe.\nWhat then is to be done ? Is the situation hopeless ?\nBy no means, if the parties to the dispute can only be induced\nto provide themselves with an adequate logic. The old logic,\nwhich abstracted from human feeling and the disturbances\n\f272 F. C. 8. Schiller. [part\nit introduced into human truth-seeking, knew of no higher\nambition than to applaud the triumphal march of pure thought.\nIt would not recognize the very impure thought of actual\nhumanity and could make nothing of its procedure, which\nfinds every step in advance stubbornly resisted by prejudice,\nignorance and indolence, and has to fight its way through\nerrors and obstacles of every description, so that it wins no\ntruth save at a cost fully commensurate with its value.\nThe new pragmatic logic, however, does not deem it unworthy\nof the dignity of human reason to notice these facts. It can\nconsequently observe that wherever truth has become a party\nquestion, its discovery ceases to be a purely theoretic problem.\nTo 'prove' a truth, cogently, absolutely, to all, and for all\ntime, becomes impossible. It becomes a question of inducing\nthose to accept it who could, if they wished, hold out against\nit, and of pioviding them with a sufficient motive to give\ntheir assent to it. Now, experience shows that the sole sort\nof truth which silences all opposition, and becomes indisputable,\nis that which develops such value as to become practically\nindispensable. Not only in ordinary life, but also in the\nsciences, beliefs which are so convenient that all work with\nthem, and so useful that all act as if they thought them\ntrue, become indisputable : theoretic scruples about their\ntruth die away, because they function as effective truths.\nThus no one now urges, or confutes, the metaphysical objections\nto the use of anaesthetics which were once common, because\ntheir use has become a part of the regular routine of medicine :\nbut such scruples are still urged against the use of hypnosis,\nbecause this treatment is not yet so firmly established in\nmedical practice.\nIt follows that it is mistaken and vain to dispute with\nobjectors like Dr. Coover about the scientific value of certain\nhistorical records as a proof of telepathy. His sweeping\ncondemnation of the Society's pioneer work 'will seem to\nmost of us entirely unjust. But nothing would be gained\nby disputing about its justice. The best, and ultimately\nthe only, way to confute, and also to convert, the critic is\nto develop telepathy into a working method of communication.\nIf telepathy occurs as a fact in nature, it must be supposed\nthat it occurs under certain conditions. If we ascertain these\n\fLXXVI.J Review. 273\nconditions, we obtain control of the phenomena. We can\nthen not only repeat at will the theoretic proofs of its existence\nand multiply the evidence for it to any desired extent, but,\nwhat is far more rapidly and universally convincing, we\ncan use it and exploit it as an alternative to telegraphy.\nNeither scientific scepticism nor popular indifference can long\nrefuse recognition to a truth-claim which is actually working,\nand yielding valuable results. But we have no right to expect\nthat the investigation of anything worth knowing will be cheap\nand easy- F. C. S. Schiller.\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART LXXVII.\nJuly, 1919.\nI.\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.\nDelivered on April 11th, 1919,\nBy the Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh, O.M., F.R.S.\nBefore entering upon the matters that I had intended to\nlay before you, it is fitting that I should refer to the loss\nwe have sustained within the last few days in the death of\nSir William Crookes, a former President of the Society during\nseveral years from 1896-1899, and a man of world-wide scientific\nreputation. During his long and active life he made many\ndiscoveries in Physics and Chemistry of the first importance.\nIn quite early days his attention was attracted by an unknown\nand brilliant green line in the spectrum, which he succeeded\nin tracing to a new element named Thallium, after its appear-\nance. Later he was able so to improve vacua as to open\nup fresh lines of enquiry with remarkable results in more\nthan one direction. The radiometer, a little instrument in\nwhich light, even candle-light, or ordinary day-light, causes\nthe rotation of delicately suspended vanes, presents problems\neven yet only partially solved. And his discoveries relating\nto electric discharge in high vacua lie near the foundation of\nthe modern theories of electricity as due to minute charged\nparticles called electrons, capable of separation from ordinary\nS\n\f276 The Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh. [part\nchemical atoms, and of moving with speeds of the order of\nthe speed of light. One is struck not only by the technical\nskill displayed in experiments more difficult at the time they\nwere made than the younger generation of workers can easily\nunderstand, but also by the extraordinary instinct which\ndirected Crookes' choice of subjects. In several cases their\nimportance was hardly realised at the time, and only later\nbecame apparent.\nI shall have occasion presently to notice in some little\ndetail his early \" Notes on Phenomena called Spiritual.\" It\nwas these that attracted my own attention to the subject.\nIn 1889 he published further \" Notes of Seances with D. D.\nHome \" in Vol. VI. of our Proceedings. I fancy that he was\ndisappointed with the reception that his views met with, having\nbeen sanguine enough to expect that he would obtain the\nsame credence when he wrote on psychical matters as when\nhe was dealing with Physics or Chemistry. In later years\nI understand he did not often introduce the subject, but when\nquestioned was firm that he had nothing to retract. One would\ngive much to know whether this attitude is still maintained.\nAny hesitation that I may have felt in undertaking the\nhonourable office to which you have called me was largely due\nto the fact that I have no definite conclusions to announce,\nand that such experiences as I have had were long ago, and\ncan hardly now carry weight as evidence to anyone but\nmyself. But I have always taken an interest in questions\nsuch as those considered by the Society, and I may perhaps as\nwell give a short account of what I have seen, for it will at\nany rate help to explain my attitude and serve as a foundation\nfor comment.\nI may begin with what is now called hypnotism. This is an\nold story ; but many have forgotten, or never realised, the\ndisbelief which was general in the fifties of the last century\nboth on the part of the public and of medical men. As to the\nformer, reference may be made to Punch, 1\nand as to the latter\n1\nVol. XXIV., p. 120 (1853), Lecturer on Electro-biology, \"Now, Sir! you\ncan't jump over that stick.\" Subject, \"Jump? Eh! Ugh! Lor bless me,\njump ? No, I know I can't\u2014never could jump\u2014Ugh !\n\" (Thunders of Applause\nfrom the Gentlemen in the cane-bottoin chairs\n\u2014\n[i.e. believers]).\n\fLXXVII.] Presidential Address. 277\nI suppose there can be no doubt, although of course there\nwere distinguished exceptions. At the present day orthodox\nmedical opinion has so far shifted its ground as to claim for\nthe profession control of what was formerly dismissed as\nimpossible and absurd\u2014certainly a less unreasonable position.\nIt was some ten or eleven years from the date of Punch's\ncartoon that I witnessed in a friend's rooms at Cambridge an\nexhibition of the powers of Madame Card. I think eight or ten\nof us were tried, including myself. We were made to gaze for\na time at a \" magnetic \" disc ; afterwards she made passes over\nour closed eyes, and finally defied us to open them. I and\nsome others experienced no difficulty ; and naturally she dis-\ncarded us and developed her powers over those\u2014about half the\nsitters\u2014who had failed or found difficulty. Among the latter\nwere personal friends of my own and two well-known Uni-\nversity athletes. One was told that he could not give his\nname, another that he would have to cross the room towards\nher when she beckoned, and so on. In spite of obvious\nefforts to resist her influence they had to obey. In conver-\nsation afterwards they assured me that they could not help\nit ; and indeed they made such fools of themselves that I\nhad no difficulty in believing them. From that evening I\nhave never felt any doubt as to the possibility of influencing\nunwilling minds by suggestion ; and I have often wished\nthat on other occasions, where dubious phenomena were in\nquestion, some of which I shall presently refer to, conviction\none way or the other had followed this precedent. I ought\nto add that, although stories were afloat to that effect, I\nnever saw the influence of Madame Card conveyed otherwise\nthan by word or gesture.\nAfter this experience I was not disinclined to believe that\nwhat was, or at any rate had recently been, orthodox opinion\nmight be quite wrong, and accordingly became interested in\nwhat I heard from friends of the doings of Home and other\nso-called mediums. Some of the stories could, as it seemed,\nbe explained away only on the supposition of barefaced lying,\nor more charitably as the result of hallucination, whether\nself-induced, or due to the suggestion and influence of others.\nThe possibility of the latter view cannot be left out of account,\nbut I have never seen anything to show that it has the\n\f278 The Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh. [part\nremotest application to my own experience or that of the\nfriends with whom I have co-operated.\nThe interest that I felt was greatly stimulated by the\nappearance of Sir W. Crookes' \" Notes of an Enquiry into the\nPhenomena called Spiritual during the years 1870-73.\" 1\nI was\nacquainted with some of the author's scientific work, and knew\nthat he was a skilful experimenter and likely to be alive to\nthe precautions required in order to guard against sense\nillusions. Presumably also he would feel the difficulty of\naccepting conclusions so much out of harmony with ordinary\nand laboratory experience. If heavy tables in a dining-room\ncan leave the floor, how is it that in the laboratory our\nbalances can be trusted to deal with a tenth of a milligram ?\nI have lately read over again Sir W. Crookes' article, and\nI do not wonder at the impression it produced upon me.\n] am tempted to quote one or two passages against which I\nfind my old pencil marks. Under the heading\u2014The Appear-\nance of Hands, either Self-luminous or Visible by Ordinary\nLight, he writes, \" I have retained one of these hands in my\nown, firmly resolved not to let it escape. There was no struggle\nor effort made to get loose, but it gradually seemed to resolve\nitself into vapour, and faded in that manner from my grasp.\"\nI believe that the rationalistic explanation is that the hand\nwas an inflated glove, like a rubber balloon, from which the\nair gradually leaked away, but I gave Sir W. Crookes credit\nfor being able to retain the rubber.\nAnother incident of an entirely different character is thus\ndescribed. \" A lady was writing automatically by means of\nthe planchette. I was trying to devise a means of proving\nthat what she wrote was not due to '\nimconscious cerebration.'\nThe planchette, as it always does, insisted that, although it\nwas moved by the hand and arm of the lady, the intelligence\nwas that of an invisible being who was playing on her brain\nas on a musical instrument, and thus moving her muscles.\nI therefore said to this intelligence, '\nCan you see the contents\nof this room?' 'Yes,' wrote the planchette. 'Can you see\nto read this newspaper ' ? said I, putting my finger on a\ncopy of the Times, which was on the table behind me, but\nwithout looking at it. 'Yes,' was the reply of the planchette.\n1\nQuarterly Journal of Science, Jan. 1874.\n\fLXXVII.] Presidential Address. 279\n'\nWell,' I said, '\nif you can see that, write the word which is\nnow covered by my finger, and I will believe you.' The\nplanchette commenced to move. Slowly and with great\ndifficulty, the word '\nhowever ' was written. I turned round,\nand saw the word '\nhowever ' was covered by the tip of\nmy finger.\"\n\" I had purposely avoided looking at the newspaper when\nI tried this experiment, and it was impossible for the lady,\nhad she tried, to have seen any of the printed words, for she\nwas sitting at one table, and the paper was on another table\nbehind, my body intervening.\"\nThe two mediums whose names are mentioned in the article,\nand with whom most of the observations were made, are\nHome and Miss Fox, afterwards Mrs. Jencken. A highly\ndesirable characteristic of Home's mediumship was the unusual\nopportunity allowed to the sense of sight. Home always\nobjected to darkness at his seances. \" Indeed,\" says Sir\nWilliam Crookes, \" except on two occasions . . . everything\nthat I have witnessed with him has taken place in the\nlight.\"\nI found (and indeed still find) it difficult to accept what\none may call the \" knave and fool theory \" of these occurrences ;\nbut failing that, it would seem to follow that one must admit\nthe possibility of much that contrasts strongly with ordinary\nexperience, and I was naturally anxious to obtain first hand\ninformation on which I could form an independent judgment.\nHome was no longer available, but I was able to obtain the\nco-operation of Mrs. Jencken, who stayed in my country house\nas guest during two or three visits extending altogether, I\nsuppose, over fourteen days or so. She was accompanied by\na nurse and baby, and for a small part of the time by Mr.\nJencken, who seemed curiously slow to understand that we\nhad to regard him as well as his wife with suspicion, when I\nexplained that we could not attach importance to seances\nwhen both were present. It may be well to add that they\nreceived nothing beyond the usual courtesy and entertainment\ndue to guests.\nThe results were upon the whole disappointing, and certainly\nfar short of those described by Sir W. Crookes. Nevertheless\nthere was a good deal not easy to explain away. Very little\n\f280 The Eight Hon. Lord Rayleigh. [part\nof importance occurred in a good light. It is true that at\nany hour of the day Mrs. Jencken was able to get raps upon\na door by merely placing her fingers upon it. The listener,\nhearing them for the first time, felt sure there was some one\non the other side, but it was not so. The closest scrutiny\nrevealed no movement of her fingers, but there seemed nothing\nto exclude the possibility of bone-cracking with the door\nacting as sounding-board. However, on one or two occasions\nloud thumps were heard, such as one would hardly like to\nmake with one's knee. With the exception of her fingers\nMrs. Jencken seemed always to stand quite clear, and the light\nwas good.\nOn the other hand, during seances the light was usually bad\n-\n\u2014gas turned very low. But in some other respects the\nconditions may be considered good. Before commencing, the\nroom was searched and the doors locked. Besides Mrs. Jenc-\nken, the sitters were usually only Lady Rayleigh and myself.\nSometimes a brother or a friend came. We sat close together\nat. a small, but rather heavy, pedestal table ; and when any-\nthing appeared to be doing we held Mrs. Jencken's hands,\nwith a good attempt to control her feet also with ours ; but\nit was impracticable to maintain this full control during all\nthe long time occupied by the seances. In contrast to some\nother mediums, Mrs. Jencken was not observed to fidget or to\ntry to release her limbs.\nAs I have said, the results were disappointing ; but I do not\nmean that very little happened or that what did happen was\nalways easy to explain. But most of the happenings were\ntrifling, and not such as to preclude the idea of trickery.\nOne's coat-tails would be pulled, paper cutters, etc., would fly\nabout, knocks would shake our chairs, and so on. I do not\ncount messages, usually of no interest, which were spelt out\nalphabetically by raps that seemed to come from the neigh-\nbourhood of the medium's feet. Perhaps what struck us\nmost were lights which on one or two occasions floated about.\nThey were real enough, but rather difficult to locate, though\n1 do not think they were ever more than six or eight feet\naway from us. Like some of those described by Sir W.\nOrookes, they might be imitated by phosphorus enclosed in\ncotton wool ; but how Mrs. Jencken could manipulate them\n\fLxxvn.] Presidential Address. 281\nwith her hands and feet held, and it would seem with only\nher mouth at liberty, is a difficulty.\nAnother incident hard to explain occurred at the close of a\nseance after we had all stood up. The table at which we\nhad been sitting gradually tipped over until the circular top\nnearly touched the floor, and then slowly rose again into the\nnormal position. Mrs. Jencken, as well as ourselves, was\napparently standing quite clear of it. 1 have often tried\nsince to make the table perform a similar evolution. Holding\nthe top with both hands, I can make some, though a bad,\napproximation ; but it was impossible that Mrs. Jencken\ncould have worked it thus. Possibly something better could\nbe done with the aid of an aj:>paratus of hooks and wires ;\nbut Mrs. Jencken was a small woman, without much apparent\nmuscular development, and the table for its size is heavy.\nIt must be admitted that the light was poor, but our eyes\nwere then young, and we had been for a long time in the\nsemi-darkness.\nIn common, I suppose, with most witnesses of such things,\nI repudiate altogether the idea of hallucination as an explana-\ntion. The incidents were almost always unexpected, and\nour impressions of them agreed. They were either tricks of\nthe nature of conjuring tricks, or else happenings of a kind\nvery remote from ordinary experience.\nA discouraging feature was that attempts to improve the\nconditions usually led to nothing. As an example, I may\nmention that after writing, supposed to be spirit writing,\nhad appeared, I arranged pencils and paper inside a large\nglass retort, of which the neck was then hermetically sealed.\nFor safety this was placed in a wooden box, and stood under\nthe table during several seances. The intention was to give\nopportunity for evidence that would be independent of close\nwatching during the semi-darkness. It is perhaps unnecessary\nto say that though scribbling appeared on the box, there was\nnothing inside the retort. Possibly this was too much to\nexpect. I may add that on recently inspecting the retort\nI find that the opportunity has remained neglected for forty-\nfive years.\nDining all this time I have been in doubt what interpre-\ntation to put upon these experiences. In my judgment the\n\f282 The Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh. [part\nincidents were not good enough, or under good enough con-\nditions, to establish occult influences ; but yet I have always\nfelt difficulty in accepting the only alternative explanation.\nSome circumstances, if of secondary importance, are also worthy\nof mention. Unlike some other mediums that I have known,\nMrs. Jencken never tried to divert one's attention, nor did she\nherself seem to be observant or watching for opportunities.\nI have often said that on the unfavourable hypothesis her\nacting was as wonderful as her conjuring. Seldom, or never,\nduring the long hours we were together at meals or seances\ndid she make an intelligent remark. Her interests seemed\nto be limited to the spirits and her baby.\nMr. Jencken is another difficulty. He, an intelligent man,\nwas a spiritualist, and, I have no reason to doubt, an honest\none, before he married his wife. Could she have continued\nto deceive him ? It seems almost impossible. He bore\neye-witness to the baby\u2014at the age of three months I think\nit was\u2014taking a pencil and writing a spirit message, of which\nwe saw what purported to be a photograph. If, on the other\nhand, he had found her out, would he have permitted her to\ncontinue her deceptions ?\nAfter the death of Home and Mrs. Jencken, so-called phy-\nsical manifestations of a well attested kind seem rather to\nhave fallen into abeyance, except in the case of Eusapia\nPalladino. Although I attended one or two of her seances\nat Cambridge and saw a few curious things, other members of\nthe Society have had so much better opportunities that I pass\nthem by. There is no doubt that she practised deception,\nbut that is not the last word.\nOne of the difficulties which beset our inquiry is the pro-\nvoking attitude of many people who might render assistance.\nSome see nothing out of the way in the most marvellous\noccurrences, and accordingly take no pains over the details\nof evidence on which everything depends. Others attribute\nall these things to the devil, and refuse to have anything to\nsay to them. I have sometimes pointed out that if during the\nlong hours of seances we could keep the devil occupied in\nso comparatively harmless a manner we deserved well of our\nneighbours.\nA real obstacle to a decision arises from the sporadic char-\n\fLXXVII.] Presidential Address. 283\nacter of the phenomena, which cannot be reproduced at\npleasure and submitted to systematic experimental control.\nThe difficulty is not limited to questions where occult in-\nfluences may be involved. This is a point which is often\nmisunderstood, and it may be worth while to illustrate it by\nexamples taken from the history of science.\nAn interesting case is that of meteorites, discussed by Sir\nL. Fletcher, formerly Keeper of Minerals in the British Museum,\nfrom whose official pamphlet (published in 1896) some extracts\nmay be emoted :\n\u2014\" 1. Till the beginning of the present [i.e.\n19th] century, the fall of stones from the sky was an event,\nthe actuality of which neither men of science nor the mass\nof the people could be brought to believe in. Yet such\nfalls have been recorded from the earliest times, and the\nrecords have occasionally been received as authentic by a whole\nnation. In general, however, the witnesses of such an event\nhave been treated with the disrespect usually shown to re-\nporters of the extraordinary, and have been laughed at for\ntheir supposed delusions : this is less to be wondered at\nwhen we remember that the witnesses of a fall have usually\nbeen few in number, unaccustomed to exact observation,\nfrightened by what they both saw and heard, and have had a\ncommon tendency towards exaggeration and superstition.\"\nAfter mention of some early stones, he continues : \u2014\n\" 3. These falls from the sky, when credited at all, have\nbeen deemed prodigies or miracles, and the stones have been\nregarded as objects for reverence and worship. It has even\nbeen conjectured that the worship of such stones was the\nearliest form of idolatry. . . . The Diana of the Ephesians,\n'\nwhich fell down from Jupiter,' and the image of Venus at\nCyprus appear to have been, not statues, but conical or pyra-\nmidal stones.\"\n\" 5. Three French Academicians, one of whom was the\nafterwards renowned chemist Lavoisier, presented to the\nAcademy in 1772 a report on the analysis of a stone said to\nhave been seen to fall at Luce on September 13, 1768. As the\nidentity of lightning with the electric spark had been recently\nestablished by Franklin, they were in advance convinced that\n'\nthunder-stones '\nexisted only in the imagination ; and never\ndreaming of the existence of a '\nsky-stone '\nwhich had no\n\f284 The Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh. [part\nrelation to a '\nthunder-stone, ' they somewhat easily assured\nboth themselves and the Academy that there was nothing\nunusual in the mineralogical characters of the Luce specimen,\ntheir verdict being that the stone was an ordinary one which\nhad been struck by lightning.\"\n\" 6. In 1794 the German philosopher Chladni, famed for his\nresearches into the laws of sound, brought together numerous\naccounts of the fall of bodies from the sky, and called the\nattention of the scientific world to the fact that several masses\nof iron, of which he specially considers two, had in all pro-\nbability come from outer space to this planet.\"\nIn 1802 Edward Howard read a paper before the Royal\nSociety of London giving an account of the comparative\nresults of a chemical and mineralogical investigation of four\nstones which had fallen in different places. He found from\nthe similarity of their component parts \" very strong evidence\nin favour of the assertion that they had fallen on our globe.\nThey have been found at places very remote from each other,\nand at periods also sufficiently distant. The mineralogists who\nhave examined them agree that they have no resemblance to\nmineral substances properly so called, nor have they been\ndescribed by mineralogical authors.\" After this quotation\nfrom Howard, Fletcher continues :\n\u2014\n\" 13. This paper aroused much interest in the scientific\nworld, and, though Chladni's theory that such stones come\nfrom outer space was still not accepted in France, it was\nthere deemed more worthy of consideration after Poisson\n(following Laplace) had shown that a body shot from the moon\nin the direction of the earth, with an initial velocity of 7592\nfeet a second, would not fall back upon the moon, but would\nactually, after a journey of sixty-four hours, reach the earth,\nupon which, neglecting the resistance of the air, it would fall\nwith a velocity of about 31,508 feet a second.\"\n\" 14. Whilst the minds of the scientific men of France were\nin this unsettled condition, there came a report that another\nshower of stones had fallen, this time .... within easy reach\nof Paris. To settle the matter finally, if possible, the physicist\nBiot was directed by the Minister of the Interior to inquire\ninto the event on the spot. After a careful examination . . .\nBiot was convinced that on Tuesday, April 26, 1803, about\n\f1XXVII.] Presidential Address. 285\n1 p.m., there was a violent explosion in the neighbourhood of\nl'Aigle .... that some moments before .... a fire ball in\nquick motion was seen .... that on the same day many\nstones fell in the neighbourhood of l'Aigle. Biot estimated\nthe number of the stones at two or three thousand ....\nWith the exception of a few little clouds of ordinary character,\nthe sky was quite clear. The exhaustive report of Biot, and\nthe conclusive nature of his proofs, compelled the whole of\nthe scientific world to recognise the fall of stones on the\nearth from outer space as an undoubted fact.\"\nI commend this history to the notice of those scientific men\nwho are so sure that they understand the character of Nature's\noperations as to feel justified in rejecting without examination\nreports of occurrences which seem to conflict with ordinary\nexperience. Every tiro now knows that the stones to be\nseen in most museums had an origin thought impossible by\nsome of the leading and most instructed men of about a century\nago.\nOther cases of strange occurrences, the nature or reality of\nwhich is, I suppose, still in doubt, are \" Globe lightning\n\"\nand \"Will of the wisp.\" The evidence for globe lightning\nis fairly substantial, but in the judgment of many scientific\nmen is outweighed by the absence of support in laboratory\nexperience. At one time I was more disposed to believe in it\nthan I am now, in view of the great extension of elec-\ntrical experimenting during the last thirty years. Kelvin\nthought it might be explained as an ocular illusion. By a\nlightning flash the retina is powerfully impressed, it may be\nexcentrically, with the formation of a prolonged positive\n\" spectrum \" or image which, as the eye tries to follow it,\nappears to sail slowly along. Some seconds later, the arrival\nof the sound of thunder causes a shock, under which the\nluminous globe disappears and is thought to have burst ex-\nplosively. I think this explanation, which would save the\ngood faith and to some extent the good sense of the observers,\ndeserves attention.\nThen again the Will of the wisp, for which I take it there\nused to be plenty of evidence. I have been told by the Duke\nof Argyle\u2014the friend and colleague of Gladstone\u2014that in his\nyouth it was common at Inveraray, but had been less seen\n\f286 The Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh. [part\nlatterly, owing, he thought, to drainage operations. Chemists\nwill not readily believe in the spontaneous inflammation of\n\"marsh gas,\" but I have heard the suggestion made of phos-\nphoric gases arising from the remains of a dead sheep that\nhad got entangled.\nThe truth is that we are ill equipped for the investigation\nof phenomena which cannot be reproduced at pleasure\nunder good conditions. And a clue is often necessary before\nmuch progress can be made. Men had every motive for\ntrying to understand malaria. Exposure at night on low\nground was known to be bad ; and it had even been sug-\ngested that mosquito nets served as a protection ; but before\nPasteur, and indeed for some years after, it seems never to have\noccurred to any one that the mosquito itself was the\nvehicle. Sir A. Geikie has remarked that until recent times\nthe study of the lower forms of life was regarded with some-\nthing like contempt. Verily, the microbes have had their\nrevenge.\nBut when all this has been said we must not forget that\nthe situation is much worse when it is complicated by the\nattempts of our neighbours to mislead us, as indeed occasionally\nhappens in other matters of scientific interest where money is\ninvolved. Here also the questions before this Society differ\nfrom most of those dealt with by scientific men, and may\noften need a different kind of criticism.\nSuch criticism it has been the constant aim of the Society\nto exercise, as must be admitted by all who have studied\ncarefully our published matter. If my words could reach\nthem, I would appeal to serious inquirers to give more attention\nto the work of this Society, conducted by experienced men\nand women, including several of a sceptical 'turn of mind,\nand not to indulge in hasty conclusions on the basis of reports\nin the less responsible newspaper press or on the careless\ngossip of ill-informed acquaintances. Many of our members\nare quite as much alive to a priori difficulties as any outsider\ncan be.\nOf late years the published work of the Society has dealt\nrather with questions of another sort, involving telepathy,\nwhether from living or other intelligences, and some of the\nmost experienced and cautious investigators are of opinion\n\flxxvii.] Presidential Address. 287\nthat a case has been made out. Certainly some of the cross-\ncorrespondences established are very remarkable. Their evalua-\ntion, however, requires close attention and sometimes a back-\nground of information, classical and other, not at the disposal\nof all of us. In this department I often find my estimate\nof probabilities differing from that of my friends. I have\nmore difficulty than they feel over telepathy between the\nliving, but if I had no doubts there I should feel less difficulty\nthan many do in going further. I think emphasis should be\nlaid upon the fact that the majority of scientific men do not\nbelieve in telepathy, or even that it is possible. We are very\nlargely the creatines of our sense-organs. Only those physicists\nand physiologists who have studied the subject realise what\nwonderful instruments these are. The eye, the ear, and the\nnose\u2014even the human nose\u2014are hard to beat, and within\ntheir proper range are more sensitive than anything we can\nmake in the laboratory. It is true that with long exposures\nwe can photograph objects in the heavens that the eye cannot\ndetect ; but the fairer comparison is between what we can\nsee and what can be photographed in say l-10th second\u2014all\nthat the eye requires. These sense-organs, shared with the\nhigher animals, must have taken a long time to build up, and\none would suppose that much development in other directions\nmust have been sacrificed or postponed in that interest. Why\nwas not telepathy developed until there could be no question\nabout it ? Think of an antelope in danger from a lion about\nto spring upon him, and gloating over the anticipation of his\ndinner. The antelope is largely protected by the acuteness\nof his senses and his high speed when alarmed. But would\nit not have been simpler if he could know something tele-\npathically of the lion's intention, even if it were no more\nthan vague apprehension warning him to be on the move ?\nBy telepathy is to be understood something more than is\nimplied in the derivation of the word, the conveying of feeling\nor information otherwise than by use of the senses, or at\nany rate the known senses. Distance comes into the question\nmainly because it may exclude their ordinary operation.\nSome appear to think that all difficulty is obviated by the\nsupposition of -an unknown physical agency capable of propa-\ngating effects from one brain to another, acting like the\n\f288 The Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh. [part\ntransmitter and receiver in wireless telegraphy or telephony.\nOn a physical theory of this kind one must expect a rapid\nattenuation with distance, not suggested by the records. If\ndistance is an important consideration, one might expect\nhusbands and wives with their heads within two or three feet\nof one another to share their dreams habitually. But there\nis a more fundamental objection. Specific information is,\nand can only be, conveyed in this manner by means of a\ncode. People seem to forget that all speaking and writing\ndepend upon a code, and that even the voluntary or involun-\ntary indications of feeling by facial expression or gestures\ninvolves something of the same nature. It will hardly be\nargued that telepathy acts by means of the usual code of\ncommon language, as written or spoken.\nThe conclusion that I draw is that no pains should be\nspared to establish the reality of telepathy on such sure ground\nthat it must be generally admitted by all serious inquirers.\nIt is quite natural that those who have already reached this\nposition should be more interested in the question of com-\nmunications from the dead. To my mind telepathy with the\ndead would present comparatively little difficulty when it is\nadmitted as regards the living. If the apparatus of the senses\nis not used in one case, why should it be needed in the other ?\nI do not underrate the difficulties of the investigation. Very\nspecial conditions must be satisfied if we are to be indepen-\ndent of the good faith of the persons primarily concerned.\nThe performance of the Zanzigs may be recalled. When there\ncould be no question of confederates, answers respecting objects\nsuddenly exhibited were given with such amazing rapidity\nthat secret codes seemed almost excluded. But when a party\nin which I was included, attempted to get a repetition under\nstricter conditions, there was an almost entire failure. Our\nrequirement was simply that the husband should not speak\nafter he had seen the object that was to be described by the\nwife. But I must add the inevitable qualification. Towards\nthe end of the evening cards were correctly told several\ntimes, when we were unable to detect anything that could\nserve as audible signals.\nI have dwelt upon the difficulties besetting -the acceptance\nof telepathy, but I fully recognise that a strong case has been\n\fLXXVII.] Presidential Address. 289\nmade out for it. I hope that more members of the Society\nwill experiment in this direction. It is work that can be done\nat home, at odd times, and without the help of mediums,\nprofessional or other. Some very interesting experiences of\nthis kind have been recorded by a former President, Prof.\nGilbert Murray. With perhaps an excess of caution, he\nabstained from formulating conclusions that must have seemed\nto most readers to follow from the facts detailed. I trust we\nmay hear still more from him.\nIt is hardly necessary to emphasise that in evaluating\nevidence it is quality rather than quantity with which\nwe are concerned. No one can doubt the existence of appar-\nently trustworthy reports of many occult phenomena. For\nthis there must be a reason, and our object is to find it.\nBut whatever it may be, whether reality of the phenomena,\nor the stupidity or carelessness or worse of the narrators, a\nlarger sweep is sure to add to the material. However, we\nmay hope that such additions will occasionally afford clues,\nor at least suggestions for further inquiry. And if the pheno-\nmena, or any of them, are really due to supernormal causes,\nfurther solid evidence of this will emerge. I feel that I\nought to apologise for giving utterance to what must seem\nplatitudes to the more experienced working members of the-\nSociety.\nSome of the narratives that I have read suggest the possi-\nbility of prophecy. This is very difficult ground. But we\nlive in times which are revolutionary in science as well as in\npolitics. Perhaps some of those who accept extreme \" rela-\ntivity \" views reducing time to merely one of the dimensions\nof a four-dimensional manifold, may regard the future as\ndiffering from the past no more than north differs from south.\nBut here I am nearly out of my depth, and had better stop.\nI fear that my attitude, or want of attitude, will be dis-\nappointing to some members of the Society who have out-\nstripped me on the road to conviction, but this I cannot\nhelp. Scientific men should not rush to conclusions, but keep\ntheir minds open for such time as may be necessary. And\nwhat was at first a policy may become a habit. After forty-\nfive years of hesitation it may require some personal experience\nof a compelling kind to break the crust. Some of those who\n\f290 The Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh. [part\nknow me best think that I ought to be more convinced than\nI am. Perhaps they are right.\nHowever this may be, I have never felt any doubt as to\nthe importance of the work carried on by the Society over\nmany years, and I speak as one who has examined not a few\nof the interesting and careful papers that have been published\nin the Proceedings. Several of the founders of the Society\nwere personal friends, and since they have gone the same\nspirit has guided us. Our goal is the truth, whatever it may\nturn out to be, and our efforts to attain it should have the\nsympathy of all, and I would add especially of scientific men.\n\fLxxvn.] Note on Mr. Piddington's Paper. 291\nII.\nNOTE ON MR. PIDDINGTON'S PAPER CALLED\n\" FRESH LIGHT ON THE ONE-HORSE DAWN\nEXPERIMENT.\"\nBy Sir Oliver Lodge.\nIn reading Mr. Piddington's extraordinarily able and\ninteresting paper in the Proceedings, Vol. XXX., pp. 175-229,\nI have a feeling that his meaning is masked and real\nintention to some extent obscured by the semi-satirical\nor humorous treatment of his theme.\nProbably his real meaning is so clear to himself that he\nfails to realise the haste and comparative inattention of\nthe majority of readers\u2014inattention which I feel sure\nwould vanish if they perceived clearly what he was\ndriving at.\nLet me ask Mr. Piddington whether his intention is\nnot something like what I conceive it to be ;\nand, for\nbrevity, let me state what I think it is, and ask for\ncorrection.\nDr. Verrall then, in his lifetime, tried a telepathic\nexperiment on his wife, who had recently become an\nautomatic writer, without informing her of the fact.\nHe endeavoured to transmit to her at intervals, over a\nconsiderable period of time, a phrase from the Orestes\nof Euripides, hovottwXov e? 'Aw. The first of these three\nGreek words has usually been taken to mean \" with one\nhorse \" ; but Dr. Verrall thought it meant the attribute\n\" solitary journeying,\"' or \" lonely-wandering,\" applied\nto Dawn.\nMyers, who was deceased and ostensibly in touch with\nMrs. Verrall through her automatic writing, got wind some-\nhow of this intended experiment of Dr. Verrall's, as well\nT\n\f292 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nas of his interpretation of \/j.ov6ttw\\ov , and thought he\ncould use the intended experiment for his own purposes\nand show that much that we regarded as direct telepathy\nbetween A and B was really effected through the agency\nof a third intelligence C,\u2014usually a discarnate intelli-\ngence.\nTo Myers the idea of \" wandering lonely towards a\ndawn \"\u2014whether derived from Verrall or otherwise\n\u2014\nseems to have suggested the pathetic and tragic figure of\n(Edipus in Sophocles' play of (Edipus Goloneus, who in\nthe strength of a divine summons arose superior to his\nrags and blindness, cast aside his props and guides, and\nset forth solitary, clad in white, towards the end of all\nhis sorrows and the dawn of a new life.\nMyers also seems to have been aware, somehow, that\na certain note of Sir Richard Jebb's, in his edition of\nSophocles, contained material that would serve his purpose.\nFor in this note, Jebb, in commenting on the word olotwvov\n(solitary journeying) occurring in the (Edipus Tyrannus,\ngives a list of adjectives of similar type. In this list he\n(rather singularly) includes the hovottwXov phrase from\nEuripides, Orestes, as well as three other examples all\ntaken from Sophocles' play (Edipus Goloneus.\nThese three passages, therefore, Myers contrived to\ninfuse into Mrs. Verrall's automatic script, in the midst\nof the gradual development of Dr. Verrall's tekypathic\nexperiment ; and also, in order to direct attention to\nwhat he had done or was doing, he proceeded to em-\nphasise that particular play by constant and repeated\nreference to its best known and most dramatic incident.\nThat this incident had specially aroused Myers's imagination\nwe know, because of the striking use he had made of\nit in connexion with the death of John Ruskin. For in\nhis Obituary Notice of Ruskin, Myers likens the end of\nthe long period of helplessness at Coniston to the passing\nof the blind (Edipus, who was thus lovingly summoned by\nthe unguessed accompanying God to enter into the bright-\nness which awaited him :\n\" Come, CEdipus, why linger on our journey ?\nThou hast kept me waiting long.\"\n\flxxvii.] Note on Mr. Piddington 's Paper. 293\nAccordingly the scripts, ostensibly influenced by Verrall\nbut really dominated and inspired by Myers, make persis-\ntent reference to an old man clad in white and going with\noutstretched hand and raised staff on foot towards the\nrising sun, alone with God and with none other. By\nwhose aid also a great swarm would be held in check.\nFragments of this apparently alien theme\u2014quite remote\nfrom the bare Euripidean phrase and from anything\nintended by Dr. Verrall\u2014are scattered throughout the\nattempts at telepathic production of the desired words.\nYet this incursion, both at the time and subsequently,\nwhen ultimately Dr. and Mrs. Verrall discussed the scripts\njointly, is treated by the experimenters as rubbish inevitably\nsuperposed upon, and somewhat confusing and choking,\nthe main telepathic transmission ; \u2014which after all was in\ndue time more or less accomplished : \u2014-the word es, and\nwords beginning with mono, and some reference to horse\nas well as dawn, being obtained.\nBut the scripts themselves, in their comments on what\nwas obtained, passt\nthese successes by as comparatively\nunimportant, and emphasise instead the theme of the\nblind traveller, an old man in white. This theme was\nrepeated and called attention to as if it were the most\nimportant part of the script :\n\u2014\n-e.g., an interim statement,\n\" your husband's thought was good but not complete.\nThe old man in white was the best part of it but I\nhave not been able to finish that, and now it has all\ngone away. Put it aside, it will return some day.\"\nTo clinch the matter a clear reference to Coniston and\nRuskin was made in the script, so as to assure anyone who\nhad begun to grasp the main theme that he was right.\nI venture to think that the whole experiment is of the\nutmost importance as showing of what nature some of\nour telepathic experiences are, and how closely those on\nthe other side of the veil can watch and stimulate and\nmodify and improve our efforts.\nBut all that Mr. Piddington allows himself to indicate\nof this theory, save in a manner which may be sufficient\nfor those who have the patience to dissect it out, is that\n\f294 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nif people choose to consider the whole incident a case of\ntelepathy between the living, he is not going to say them\nnay. Witness the following quotations from his paper :\n\" Not that I am to be understood as advocating any\ntheory in opposition to that of telepathy inter vivos to\naccount for the phenomena under discussion. I am but\ntrying to bring out how curious are the assumptions which\nthis theory involves. It isn't by any means a simple\ntheory.\n\" Personally I advance no theory of this particular case,\nof which I gladly make a present to those who hold that\ntelepathy inter vivos is the true explanation of the super-\nnormal phenomena observable in scripts. They need,\nI fancy, cheering up a little ; and if so be that from this\ncase they can extract any comfort, so far as I am con-\ncerned, they are welcome to it.\"\nThis is just the semi-satirical conclusion which one is\nliable to find in Mr. Piddington's recent papers\u2014a satire\ndue no doubt to the kind of uninstructed comments\nwith which they have been received even by persons of\nhigh intelligence ; \u2014and it is in the hope that he will\nallow to posterity at any rate some clue or hint of his\nreal meaning that I write this purely interrogative note.\nFor to one who has worked closely at any given pheno-\nmenon a theory must have occurred ; and a worker's\nopinion concerning any given theory is of far more value\nthan that of a mere reader. If then the worker does not\nput his opinion on record, in clear and unmistakable\nform, it may happen that future students, overwhelmed\nby the mass of material set before them, may pass over\nlightly and cursorily any episode which is not properly\nemphasised and stressed by the original worker. If he\nhas not found clear evidence of anything valuable therein,\nit will seem unlikely that anything better than a negative\nand rather muddled conclusion can be deduced from it.\nThere are one or two minor points on which I might\nask questions, but I will content myself with one, in case\nMr. Piddington desires to say anything about it.\nOn page 212, at a time when Mrs. Verrall got the word\n\fLXXVII.] Note on Mr. Piddington 's Paper. 295\n'\neuhippoi ' in her script, Dr. Verrall is said to have \"fixed\nhis mind on the notion of horse.\" This interpretation of\npolon was different from the '\nwandering '\ntranslation in\nDr. Verrall's mind, but perhaps it was so simple and\nnatural and obvious a rendering that he chose to give the\nhorse motif a chance ; and certainly the attempt appeared\nto be successful, though the form in which it appeared\niu the script is peculiar and suggestive.\n\f296 J. G. Piddington. [part\nIII.\nA REPLY TO SIR OLIVER LODGE'S NOTE.\nBy J. G. Piddington.\nSir Oliver Lodge asks me to make clear what was the\nobject of my paper called \" Eresh Light on the One-\nHorse Dawn Experiment.\" I had several objects ; and\nI will begin by stating what these were, and then go on\nto deal with the question of how far Sir Oliver has\ncorrectly represented my views.\nMy first object was to offer a new interpretation of Mrs.\nVerrall's One-Horse Dawn scripts. Mis. Verrall's inter-\npretation of them, first given at a meeting of the Society\nin 1903 and afterwards published in 1906 in Proc, Vol.\nXX., met with general acceptance and held the field for\nsome fourteen years. It may, roughly speaking, be said\nto have amounted to this :\n\u2014That, amid a mass of irrele-\nvant rubbish, efforts to give the sound or sense of the\nthree words, \/j-ovoiroikov e? 'Aw, were plainly discernible,\nand that knowledge was shown of the fact, normally\nunknown to Mrs. Verrall, that her husband was trying\nto transmit these three words, and also, perhaps, of Dr.\nVerrall's particular view about the meaning of the word\n\/j.ovo7rw\\ov. This interpretation involved the rejection of a\nvery considerable amount of the contents of the scripts,\nand claimed intelligibility for only a comparatively small\nresiduum.\nMy interpretation claims to make sense of much that\nMrs. Verrall discarded as rubbish by referring it to a\ncertain note of Jebb's, in which the words plovottwXov 'Aw\nare actually quoted, and in which the precise meaning of\n\flxxvii.] A Reply to Sir Oliver Lodge's Note. 297\nthe adjective \/ulovottcoXov and of other analogous compound\nadjectives is discussed.\nMy second object was to show that, whereas in Mrs.\nVerrall's view reference to the experiment ceased in the\nscripts when in 1902 the experimenter abandoned it, in\nreahty the subject was pursued at intervals for years\nafterwards up to 1915, and that these later references\nfall into line with and throw light upon the earlier refer-\nences which Mrs. Verrall had rejected as rubbish.\nSo far, I think, my intention should have been clear\nto any but a careless reader.\nMy third object I thought would be clear too ; and if\nI expressed myself ironically, I hoped thereby not to ob-\nscure but rather to emphasise my meaning. The know-\nledge one happens to possess oneself one is apt to impute\nto others ; and so, I suppose, I assumed the body of our\nmembers to be more familiar with the publications of our\nSociety and especially with the past history of the One-\nHorse Dawn case than they really are. Let me, then,\ntake advantage of the opportunity kindly afforded me by\nSir Oliver Lodge\u2014whose interest in my paper I greatly\nvalue\u2014to repair my omission, and recall the past history\nof the One-Horse Dawn case, and by so doing prepare\nthe way for explaining my third object.\nWhen Mrs. Verrall first laid the facts of the One-\nHorse Dawn case before the Society, she classified it\nprovisionally as \" telepathic, in the sense that the facts\nin question were known to some living person at the time\nthat reference to them was made in the automatic writing\"\n{Journal, Vol. XL, p. 71). It is true that Sir Oliver\nLodge expressed at the time the view that\n' 1\nthere might\nbe some third intelligence at work \" {id. ib. p. 74) ;\nbut,\nbarring this mildly-worded caveat, the case was generally\naccepted by psychical researchers of all schools of thought\nas one of telepathy inter vivos. And, indeed, neither the\nexperiment as devised, nor its result as interpreted by\nMrs. Verrall, differed in any essential feature from ordinary\ncases of successful, or partially successful, thought-trans-\nference, such as those where an agent tries to convey a\nnumber or a diagram to a percipient, except for the\n\f298 J. G. Piddington. [PAET\nspiritistic setting in which the percipient-automatist framed\nher impressions. 1\nReduced to its simplest elements the\ncase might be thus summarised :\nAGENT (Dr. Verrall).

This was the line taken by Mrs.\nAnna Hude in her Evidence for Gommvnicatio?i with the\nDead, by various speakers during discussions at our\nmeetings, and frequently in private conversations. Then,\nin 1909, Professor A. 0. Pigou, in his discussion of whether\n\" the complementariness in complementary cross-correspond-\nences is intentional or not \" (Proc, Vol. XXIII., pp. 286,\nff.), rested one of his chief arguments on the assumption\nthat the phenomena of the One-Horse Dawn case were,\nand admittedly were, due to telepathy between the living.\nSir Oliver Lodge in a reply to Professor Pigou's article\n(Journal, Vol. XIV., pp. 134 ff.) \u2014either forgetting, or for\nhis immediate purpose ignoring, the caveat he had previ-\nously entered\u2014did not dispute this assumption. Mr.\nGerald Balfour, likewise, agreed not to contest Professor\nPigou's argument that it is superfluous to invoke spiritual\nagency to explain the phenomena of the One-Horse Dawn\ncase, though he was careful to add that he did not con-\nsider \" the argument from superfluity \" \" absolutely\nconclusive \" (Proc, Vol. XXV., p. 44).\n1\nIt is not necessary, I think, to regard Mrs. Verrall's ignorance of the fact\nthat an experiment was being made as constituting an essential difference ; for\nby making a regular practice of writing automatically she was thereby putting\nherself into much the same attitude of expectancy and receptivity as a \"per-\ncipient\" falls into when he knows that an \"agent\" is ttying an experiment.\n\flxxvii.] A Reply to Sir Oliver Lodge's Note. 299\nThe One-Horse Dawn case has proved, then, a stumbling\nblock in the way of those who attribute to spiritual\nagency more or less of the supernormal knowledge shown\nin scripts. And, indeed, how could it have been other-\nwise ? For it seemed certain that Dr. Verrall was the\nsource of whatever knowledge of things unknown to Mrs.\nVerrall these scripts of hers displayed, and yet, when this\nknowledge emerged in them, instead of its being said to\ncome from Dr. Verrall or of its being given in a colour-\nless manner without indication of source, it was represented\nas coming from a discarnate mind: the \"I\" of the scripts\nunquestionably purporting to be either Frederic Myers or one\nof the group of discarnate friends whom the scripts repre-\nsent as collaborating with him. In view of the admittedly\nhuman source of the knowledge shown in the scripts,\nwhy, it was argued, treat these pretensions and the whole\nspiritistic setting of the \" communications \" as anything\nmore than subliminal romance and masquerade ? Had\nthere been anything in the scripts apposite to the subject\nof the experiment for which it was not easy to hold\nDr. Verrall responsible, or which did not appear likely\nto have been contributed by Mrs. Verrall after she had\ntelepathically grasped the purport and subject of the\nexperiment, then it might have been worth while to ex-\namine whether there was any warrant for the claim of\nspiritual agency. But there did not appear to be any-\nthing of the sort.\nIt is here that the third object of my paper comes in.\nIf my new interpretation of the One-Horse Dawn scripts\nis right, then the assumption that the knowledge displayed\nin them had its source in Dr. Verrall's mind can no\nlonger be made with anything approaching to the same\nconfidence, or allowed to pass with the same mild protest,\nas before. Would Sir Oliver Lodge, for instance, now\nbe content to say no more than that \" there might be\nsome third intelligence at work \" ;\nor would Mr. Gerald\nBalfour agree not to contest the assumption that Dr. Verrall\nwas the sole undoubted \" agent \" ? Or would Professor\nPigou himself make the same assumption, without at least\nfeeling it necessary first to refute my reading of the facts %\n\f300 J. G. Piddington. [part\nSo much for the three chief objects I had in view in\nwriting my paper. I will now proceed to deal with other\npoints raised by Sir Oliver Lodge in his Note.\nI confined myself to trying to show some of the difficul-\nties in the way of attributing the allusions to Jebb's\nnote on oloXoovov to Dr. Verrall or to Mrs. Verrall ;\nand I deliberately refrained from attempting to identify\nthe intelligence responsible for them. I will explain why\nI took this line.\nAlthough as a matter of fact I believe, as Sir Oliver\nrightly divines, that Frederic Myers, either alone or in\ncollaboration with other discarnate scholars, was responsible\nfor the allusions to Jebb's note on the word oloCwvov, to\nthe death of Oedipus and to the Obituary Notice of Ruskin,\nI do not find in the One-Horse Dawn scripts themselves\nevidence for this view cogent enough to be worth putting\nforward. (My belief rests on considerations, to explain\nwhich I should have had to travel far outside the\nparticular case I was concerned with ; and that would\nhave been undesirable.)\nThe knowledge displayed in the answer made by MyersP\nand Myersv to Mrs. Verrall's question about avro? ovpavos\naKVfxoav (Proc, Vol. XXII., pp. 107-172), and in the answer\nmade by MyersP to Mr. Dorr's question about Lethe (Proc,\nVol. XXV., pp. 86-144), was characteristic of Frederic\nMyers. It was the kind of thing he knew, and it was\nnot the kind of thing that the experimenters or the\nautomatists concerned did know ; and so I was ready to\nargue that the nature of these answers pointed to Myers\nas the author of them. Similarly,\u2014though the cases are\nnot on all fours with the preceding, because the \" com-\nmunications \" were not evoked by questions, but given\nspontaneously\u2014in the \" Statius \" and \" Dionysius' Ear \"\ncases {Proc, Vols. XXVII. , pp. 221-243 ; XXIX. pp. 197-\n238) where the knowledge shown had once been provably,\nor almost provably, possessed by the soi-disant \" com-\nmunicator,\"' and was not normally possessed by the\nautomatist, the emergence of this knoAvledge in this\nautomatist's scripts could be urged in support of the\ncommunicator's claim. But the knowledge of Jebb's\n\flxxvii.] A Reply to Sir Oliver Lodge's Note. 301\nnote on oiofyrov cannot, it seems to me, be fairly\nclaimed as characteristic of Myers or of any of his colla-\nborators. Myers was not. I believe, interested in the\nminutiae of classical scholarship. At the same time,\nsince he greatly admired Jebb's scholarship and, as Jebb's\nLife shows, was on terms of intimate friendship with\nhim, and was himself a classical scholar of rare attain-\nments, there is no reason why he should not have been\nacquainted with Jebb*s note. But to say this, is quite\na different thing from maintaining that he was acquainted\nwith it, or that knowledge of it would be characteristic\nof him.\nHence for purposes of argument I should prefer to call\nthe intelligence responsible for the allusions to Jebb's note\nX, and to leave it at that ;\nprovided that I have made\nit clear that anyone who should seek to identify X with\nDr. or Mrs. Verrall ought not to shirk the difficulties\nin the way of this identification, and should recognise\nhow profound a dislocation it involves between the con-\nscious and sub-conscious strata of whichever of the two\nhe may fix upon as the guilty agent.\nSir Oliver represents me as supposing that \" Myers\n\"\nwas switched on to the topic of Oedipus' death by the\nidea of \" lonely wandering towards a dawn \" derivable\nfrom fxovoiTwKov is 'Aw, and that \"somehow\"\u2014apparently,\nin a casual sort of way\u2014he became aware of Jebb's note.\nThis is not my view. In the first place I do not see\nwhy words which may mean \" to the lonely-wandering\ndawn,\" but which cannot mean \"lonely wandering to\nthe dawn,\" should by themselves remind anyone of\nOedipus going to his death. In the second place, Sir\nOliver seems to me to reverse the natural logical order\nin which these two topics would have been evoked by the\nwords fxovoirwkov h 'Aw. It was surely the note of Jebb\"s\ncontaining and discussing these very words that must\nfirst have come into X's mind when he got scent of the\nsubject of Dr. Verrall's experiment, and only subsequently\nthat the death of Oedipus was suggested to him partly\nby the quotations from the Oedipus Coloneus in Jebb's\nnote and partly by Dr. Verrall's interpretation of \/uovottcoXov\n\f302 J. G. Piddinglon. [part\nas involving the idea of solitariness and, perhaps, that\nof wandering.\nSir Oliver draws attention to the fact that, in spite of\nDr. VerralPs thinking that the second half of the word\n\/j.ov67tw\\ov means \" wandering \" rather than \" horse,\"\nhe nevertheless at one point in the experiment \" fixed\nhis mind on the notion of horse.\" I see no difficulty\nhere I presume that Dr. Verrall tried any and every\nmeans that occurred to him of transmitting the three\nwords, and that if he had thought he could improve the\nchances of success by fixing his mind on \"Monopoly,\"\nor on any other word or idea suggestive of the sound or\nsense, he would have done so, as everyone else does\n(if I may judge from my own practice) when acting as\n\" agent \" in a thought-transference experiment.\nThere is this, though, to be observed about this par-\nticular effort of Dr. Verrall's. If my interpretation of\nScripts F, G, I, and K (Proc, Vol. XXX., pp. 181-182,\n193-194) is right, attempts had been made at the word\nev'nnroi \u2014the word, that is, which is supposed to have\nbeen written as a result of Dr. Verrall's stimulus\u2014-two\nor three weeks before he \" fixed his mind on the notion\nof horse.\" Personally I am inclined to think that Dr.\nVerrall's concentration on \" horse,\" by reinforcing the\nhitherto unsuccessful efforts of X to get eviinvoi written,\nhelped X to achieve his end. Whether this was so or\nnot, it is worth noting that the word (emiriroi) that did\nfinally emerge corresponded only partially to Dr. Verrall's\nthought, but did fit in perfectly with X's previous allusions\nto the Oedipus Coloneus, for X had already in Script C,\nand perhaps also in Script E, alluded to the Chorus in\nthat play which opens with the word ev'nnrou.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to touch on three\npoints not mentioned in my paper : the first two being\npoints of detail, the third of more importance.\n(a) The word u.ov6<tto\\o<s, used in Script H to point to,\nand as an equivalent for, the word otofyvos which forms\nthe subject of Jebb's note, was not, though it might well\nhave been, included by Jebb among the examples that he\n\flxxvii.] A Reply to Sir Oliver Lodge s Note. 303\ngave of compound adjectives analogous to olo^wvos. It\nlooks as if X meant to add \/xocoVtoXo? to Jebb's list.\n(6) The Old Man in White, i.e. Oedipus, is called\n\" signifer \" in Script C, and \" viator \" in Scripts O and\nT. I noticed recently that both these words occur again\nin Mrs. Verrall's script of June 21, 1903, in the following\ncontext :\nViator\nMonadelphas signifer ou^i Aa\/wm. en tv <tk6tu> irdvra ovSe\nOyoara ra opw\/xet'a.

It looks uncommonly\nlike an attempt at cWto'Aoc? aSe\\<pas, one of the three\nphrases from the Oedipus Coloneus quoted by Jebb in his\nnote to illustrate the peculiar idiom of adjectives like\noi'o'cWo?.

None kneAV\nbetter than he did how greatly the difficulties of demon-\nstrating the agency of the dead had been increased by\nthe evidence for telepathy between the living. Broadly\nspeaking, up to the time of his death the evidence for\ncommunication from the dead was, if I may so express it,\nof a straightforward kind. Even when varied, it was simple\n\f304 J. G. Piddington. [part\nill character ; it consisted largely of trivial and every-\nday details ; and even in the best examples, such as the\nG. P. case, it showed no such marked divergence from the\nresults obtained in ordinary thought-transference experi-\nments as to debar a critical mind from treating it as\nmore than an intensive exhibition of telepathy inter\nvivos.\nI have implied above that the results obtained up to\nthe time of Myers's death in thought-transference experi-\nments, where there is no question of any but the living\nbeing concerned, were of a simple type. Our published\nrecords show that to have been the case (and our later\nrecords, I may add, tell the same tale). The agent\nthought of a Cat : the percipient got an impression of a\nCat. So uniform was the simplicity of the phenomena\nthat when on one occasion the thoughts of two agents\nbecame merged into one in the impression received by\nthe percipient, the fact is singled out for remark (Proc,\nVol. II., p. 194 and p. 190).\nThis, in broad outline, was the position when Myers\ndied. Then within a few weeks of his death Mrs. Verrall\nbegins to write automatically ; and after the lapse of a\nfew more weeks Dr. Verrall starts his experiment. Except\nthat he did not tell her what he was doing, he was mak-\ning just the same, straightforward kind of experiment as\nhad hitherto been the rule, and was aiming at and hoping\nfor just the same kind of straightforward result as we\nwere all quite pleased to obtain at that time. No one\nhad at that time evolved the theory of complex cross-\ncorrespondences, or suggested that oblique and non-\nobvious answers to questions might carry more weight\nevidentially than direct and expected ones.\nThe indirectness, the complexity, the ingenuity and the\nliterary quality of the response made in the scripts to\nDr. VerralTs experiment were an entirely original depar-\nture ; and the credit\u2014or should I say the discredit ?\n\u2014\nof it must be ascribed to the intelligence whom I call\nX.

Not three months had passed since Myers had\ndied, convinced himself of survival, but conscious of the\nweak spots in the evidence on which his belief was based.\nIf fact, how natural ! if fiction, how plausible ! that his\ndeath should be promptly followed by the appearance of\na completely new type of phenomenon, adapted to supply\na deficiency inherent in the old evidence, and suggestive,\ntoo, of the workings of his complex and richly-endowed\nmind.\nAnd this new type of evidence has neither ceased with\nthe One-Horse Dawn case nor been confined to the\nscripts of Mrs. Verrall, who might be supposed to be\n\u2014\nand, indeed, was\u2014not unfitted by education and natural\nendowments to create a subliminal personation of Frederic\nMyers. It has, as our Proceedings testify, continued ever\nsince ; and the infectious example has spread, and spread\nnot to highly-educated automatists only like Mrs. Holland,\nMrs. Salter and Mrs. Willett ; but Mrs. Piper, too, supplies\nus with a \" Myers \" who, when asked what the word\n\" Lethe \" suggested to him, gave not a simple and direct\nreply such as Mrs. Piper might have coined herself or\ndrawn from the mind of the experimenter, Mr. Dorr, but\na non-obvious and scholarij^ reply : a reply, in fact, that\nresembles very closely in character X's response to Dr.\nVerrall's experiment.\n\f306 W.

Again\nand again cases have been reported of mediums who could\nproduce the most striking phenomena \" under the strictest\ntest conditions,\" and again and again it has been found\non further investigation that insufficient precautions had\nbeen taken to exclude trickery. Even the cases in which\nno fraud has been found have usually borne so close a\nresemblance to others in which it has that the cautious\nstudent, arguing by analogy, rightly hesitates to attach\nany great importance to them. Moreover, as we learn\nmore of spurious methods, so the standard we demand\nbecomes increasingly strict, and for this reason we are\nobliged still further to discount some of the older records.\nIn face of all this it looks rather like asking for trouble\nto profess a strong opinion in favour of any phenomena\nof this class.\nNone the less I believe that \" The Reality of Psychic\nPhenomena \" is likely to become, a classic of the subject,\nfor, as I hope to show, the experiments described therein\npresent features not to be found in any similar research.\n1\nThe Reality of Psychic Phenomena.

I am well aware that\na single sitting, however satisfactory, is not sufficient\nevidence for the formation of final judgments, especially\non so precarious a subject. But, in the last analysis\nall sound judgments are provisional ; even our so-called\n\" certainties \" are never more than assessments of proba-\nbilities at a fraction closely approaching unity, and I\nthink that on the most conservative estimate we can\nfairly say that Dr. Crawford's work has raised \" physical\n\"\nphenomena to a position very near indeed to the top of\nthe \" credibility scale.\"\nIt is true that results of similar importance would not\nbe unreservedly accepted, by Physicists for example, with-\nout thorough confirmation by independent investigators,\nand, in spite of the rarity of good cases of this kind, it\nis especially necessary in Psychical Research to relax in\nno smallest degree the most rigorous canons of Scientific\nCaution. Still, I see no reason for professing doubts\nwhich I do not feel or inventing criticisms merely\nfor the sake of appearing judicious, so I may as well\nstate outright that I quite agree with Dr. Crawford when\nhe says : \"To all visitors the phenomena are so mani-\nfestly and palpably genuine that they are never troubled\nagain with doubts as to whether there is such a thing\nas psychic force.\"\nII.\nThe experiments dealt with cover some three years' work\nconcentrated almost exclusively on the two phenomena\nof \" raps \" and \" levitation without contact.\"\nThe salient features of the results, all of which were\nobtained through the remarkable mediumship of Miss\nKathleen Goligher of Belfast, are as follows :\nA.

This pressure increases with the height of\nthe platform above the floor and may be considerably\nin excess of the weight of the table.\n(v) There appears to be a definite connection between the\nmedium and the table possessing all the usual character-\nistics of a rigid structure except visibility and palpability.\nIt is approximately of V form, one limb supporting the\ntable while the other is attached in some fashion to the\nbody of the medium.\n(vi) A thin rod may be passed freely across the space\noccupied by this structure without producing any effect,\nbut the interposition of a large object appears to inter-\nfere with the structure and causes the table to drop.\n(vii) This structure can resist or transmit torsional,\ncompressional, tensional or shearing stresses of considerable\nmagnitude.\nB.

Every investigator must have a natural tend-\nency to employ the methods with which he is most\nfamiliar, and there can be little doubt that Dr. Crawford's\nposition as Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at the\nMunicipal Technical Institute of Belfast must have influ-\nenced his decision to begin his research with a thorough\nanalysis of the fundamental mechanics of the phenomena.\nIt is unlikely that any other line of attack would have\nyielded such satisfactory results, and it has, in addition,\nautomatically introduced a far greater measure of control\nthan would have accompanied more recondite methods.\nFor the benefit of those who are not familiar with\nDr. Crawford's book, and in order to give a general idea\nof the kind of experiment on which his conclusions are\nbased, I will here quote a few paragraphs dealing with\nsome of the more important examples.\n\" Experiment 2 : Reaction on the medium during levitation.\nThe table used was No. I.

The medium being seated quietly on the\nweighing machine, with hands on knees as in Experiment\n2, I asked for steady levitation of the table, which was\nimmediately given.

Having balanced the machine\nat this, I asked the operators to jerk the table (which\nup to then was steadily levitated) vertically upwards\ninto the air. This they at once did, the table rising\nquickly from 6 in. to 8 in. into the air. I asked them to\ndo it several times. The result was always the same.\nAt each upward jerk of the table the steelyard of the\nweighing-machine rose and pressed against the top stop\nand then returned to its position of balance.\nI also asked the operators to let the table slowly sag\nvertically in the air, and to arrest its motion suddenly\nbefore it reached the floor. This they did several times.\nI found that this motion also synchronised with instan-\ntaneous and temporary increase of the medium's\nweight in addition to the increased weight due to steady\nlevitation.\nConclusion. When the table is steadily levitated the\nmedium's weight is increased by an amount practically\nequal to the weight of the table.

[part\nwere apparently produced on the floor in the neighbour-\nhood of the medium. They sounded very definite, that\nis to say, as if someone were knocking firmly on the floor\nwith a piece of hard wood ;\nthey in no way resembled\nthe sound of an electric discharge as some raps have\nbeen said to do by certain observers.\nThe singing stopped and the proceedings proper\nbegan.\nFirst came a variety of raps of all kinds from scarcely\naudible taps to real \" sledge hammer \" blows which shook\nthe whole floor. These latter could not normally have\nbeen produced without the aid of some heavy percussive\ninstrument or violent kicks with the heel of a boot.\nThe members of the circle were holding hands and all\nhands were clearly visible to me. I am sure that no one\npresent could have made sufficiently violent movements\nwith their feet without attracting my attention.\nWhen the raps ceased the large metal trumpet already\nmentioned moved into the circle sliding along the ground\napparently under its own power, so to speak, the sitters\nnext to it (Miss Kathleen Goligher and Mr. Goligher)\nraising their hands to allow it to pass. It then fell on\nthe floor under the table, and after a few moments' scuffling\nabout it was separated into its two component parts.\nThese two parts then rose into the air and projected\ntowards me from under the table, being at this juncture\nnot more than 18 inches from me.\nI was invited to take hold of these two parts and I\naccordingly grasped each in turn.\nI found, in each case, that I could move the end which\nI held to and fro in any direction with the greatest ease,\nalthough I was conscious of a slight elastic resistance.\nBut when I tried to twist either of them about a longi-\ntudinal axis I was quite unable to do so. So great\nwas the resistance to torque that I can only describe it\nby saying that it felt as if the lower ends of the two\nparts were embedded in a large mass of solid concrete,\nfreely suspended so as to allow of transverse and longi-\ntudinal movement, but so heavy as to preclude twisting.\nAfter a few moments these two parts of the trumpet\n\flxxvii.] \" The Reality of Psychic Phenomena.\" 315\nfell to the ground, and shortly after the table began to\nmove about.\nThis table was about 2 feet long and H feet broad\nand was made of dark painted or stained wood. It\nhad four legs of the ordinary turned variety, which had no\ncross-bars between them, and weighed about ten pounds.\nFirst it moved to and fro over a range of about a foot.\nThen it was rotated about a vertical axis at the rate of\nabout 15-20 revolutions per minute. At the request of\nDr. Crawford the direction of rotation was reversed\nwithout delay and apparently without difficulty. This\nrotation was distinctly jerky rather than smooth, and\non the whole I should say that this irregularity was\ndue rather to the intermittent nature of the rotating\nimpulses than to inequalities of friction against the floor.\nThe table then moved again slightly, to adjust itself\napparently, gave one or two tilts, and finally rose clear\noff the floor to a height of at least 12 inches.\nIn the course of the evening it did this some six or\nmore separate times. On each occasion I bent down and\nlooked clear under the table. I was particularly well\nsituated for this observation, since, as already explained,\nthe gas stove used for warming the room was diagonally\nopposite me and emitted a reddish glow from the heated\nmetal, as well as gleams of light from cracks or the like.\nIt was easy, as the table swayed gently to and fro in\nthe air, to bring each leg in turn in line with this glow\n\u2014\nby moving my head slightly from side to side\u2014and thus\nto satisfy myself that there was nothing in contact with\nany of the legs.\nOn two occasions when the table was clear off the\nground all the members of the circle lifted their hands\nabove their heads, in which position they were verified\nby me.\nAfter two or three of these preliminary levitations I\nwas invited to step inside the circle, and I accordingly\ndid so. I grasped the table firmly with both hands and\ndid my utmost to prevent it moving, but I was quite\nunsuccessful. By dint of great exertion I could prevent\nit from moving in any one direction and could keep it\n\f316 W. Whately Smith. [part\nsteady for a second or so, but it instantly moved in\nsome other direction, the force changing with great rapidity.\nThe amount of force exerted was quite extraordinary,\nindeed incredible to anyone who has not actually ex-\nperienced it. I estimate that at times I exerted pressures\nof fully 100 lbs. weight. At one time the table was\nmade so heavy that I could not lift it. At another time,\nwhen I had for a moment relaxed my grip, it levitated\nwithin six inches of me. While it was thus suspended\nin the air I again took hold of it and found that although\nI could move it, within limits, easily in any direction in\nthe plane of its top, I encountered a remarkably solid\nresistance when I tried to push it downwards and towards\nthe medium at an angle of about 45 degrees. So great\nwas the resistance in this direction that it felt like push-\ning against a solid strut of wood or metal.\nDuring the whole of this time I was standing within\nthree feet of the medium and, most of the time, facing\nher. I could see distinctly the whole of her body down\nto the knees, and the light from the lamp fell directly\non to her lap. Her feet were in shadow and I could not\nmake them out distinctly. This is natural as she always\nsits with them tucked under her chair and her heels\nagainst its crossbar.\nI could infallibly have detected any movement of the\nmedium, and I can certify that she sat absolutely motion-\nless during the whole time that the table was performing\nthese violent evolutions.\nI later sat on the table and, with my feet clear of the\nfloor, was moved a distance of about six or eight inches.\nIn addition, the table was three times tilted up to such\nan angle that I was unable to retain my seat.\nFinally, after I had dismounted, it pushed me to the\nextreme edge of the circle, moving to a distance of fully\nfour feet from the medium in the process. In this posi-\ntion I tried my hardest to push it back. Again it felt\nlike pushing against a solid strut. By putting out all\nmy strength I was only able to move it an inch or so.\nCertain minor incidents also took place, and one or two\ninteresting variations on the above were introduced.\n\flxxvii.] \" The Reality of Psychic Phenomena.\" 317\nFor instance, raps were produced on the under surface\nof the table while I rested my hands on the top, and\nI could plainly feel the wood quivering under the blows.\nAgain, at one time the table was thrown upon the\nground, levitated in this position (legs horizontal and\npointing towards the medium), and finally restored to its\nupright position. This last process was performed with\ndifficulty and only succeeded after several attempts. It\nwas done by a series of strong jerks, exactly as if manipu-\nlated by an invisible hand which appeared to try to\nchange its grip rapidly but sometimes missed it.\nIII.\nIn discussing these phenomena the first question to be\ndealt with is that of genuineness, for, as Dr. Crawford\nsays \"... all the experiments recorded . \\ . depend\nfor any value they may have on the fact that the table\nmovements, levitations, raps, blows and other phenomena\nare genuine productions due to the action of psychic\nforce and in no way caused by fraudulent action on the\npart of the medium or members of the circle.\"\nThe two possibilities which must be considered in this\nconnection are Illusion and Fraud.\nILLUSION, (i) It may be doubted whether true\nillusion has ever been a source of error in the study of\ncases of this type. By '\ntrue illusion '\nI mean the direct\nimposition by a trickster of an hallucination which has\nno foundation in objective reality, as opposed to faulty\nconclusions arising from malobservation, or unwarranted\nextrapolation from correct observations or unsound reason-\ning, which have, of course, been common enough, as\nhave also false suggestions by the performer. Such\nhallucinations may be imposable on suitably sensitive\nsubjects in certain hypnotic states, but I am not aware of\nany evidence which suggests that normal persons can be\nso deluded.\n(ii) One of the mainstays of the professional illusionist\nis the creation in the minds of his audience of an anticipa-\ntion that a certain event is about to happen, followed by\n\f318 W. Whately Smith. [part\na suggestion that it has happened and commonly supple-\nmented by an adroit distraction of attention at the\nmoment when it is supposed to happen but does not.\nI may say in parenthesis that several excellent examples\nof this method are to be found in Zollner's account of\nhis sittings with Slade, who seems to have been a past-\nmaster at this sort of thing. But the method can only\nwork when the illusionist is in charge of the proceedings,\nwhich is not the case here.\n(iii) It is impossible to reconcile the idea of illusion,\nwhether imposed or self-induced, with results recorded\nby mechanical apparatus.\n(iv) Finally, speaking personally, I cannot believe that\nmy own very vigorous \" wrestle \" with the table\u2014\na\nconsiderable exertion I may say\u2014could have been an\nhallucination imposed and removed without my knowledge.\nI do not think it likely, however, that anyone will\nattempt to explain away the phenomena along these lines,\nso I will say no more, except that if anyone does seriously\nthink that illusion is a probable explanation and can\nadduce evidence to support his views I shall be pleased\nto undertake a more exhaustive analysis of the possibilities.\nFRAUD. The possibility of trickery demands much\nmore serious consideration, and I am sure that neither\nDr. Crawford nor the members of the circle will resent\nmy discussing it with the utmost care, especially as I\nanticipate that the great majority of those who are\ndisinclined to accept the experiments at their face value\nwill base their objections on an accusation of fraud. Nor\ndo I blame them, for fraud has occurred so frequently\nthroughout the history of Psychical Research, has stultified\nso much research and vitiated so many cases in which\nthere is reason to suppose that genuine phenomena were\nalso produced, that it is both natural and necessary to\nsuspect its presence in contemporary cases of similar\ntype.\nBut this attitude of suspicion, right and proper though\nit is, arises from an argument by analogy, and is only\nlegitimate in proportion as the analogy is exact. Essentially\nthis argument runs as follows :\n\flxxvii.] \" The Reality of Psychic Phenomena.''' 319\n\"It is found from experience that there is a chance\n\" P \" of any member of a class \" A \" of objects a1; a.2,\na33 . . . etc., possessing a certain quality \" B \" : the\nobject aH belongs to the class \" A \" ;\ntherefore there is\na chance \" P \" that the object an possesses the quality\n\" B.\"\nThis is no more than a thinly disguised form of the\nsyllogistic type: \" All S is P : M is S ; therefore M is P.\"\nIts soundness in this particular case is most likely to be\nvitiated by the inaccuracy of the minor premise\n\u2014\" the\nobject an belongs to the class \"A.\"\nIn other words, we have found from experience that of\na certain class of cases 99 out of 100, say, are fraudulent ;\nwe therefore argue that the chances are about 99 to 1 in\nfavour of another case of the same class being also fraudu-\nlent. But this argument only holds good provided that\nthe characteristics of the particular case under considera-\ntion are sufficiently like those of the previous cases to\nwarrant our placing it unreservedly in the same class\nwith them.\nIf they are wholly dissimilar, the special case cannot\nbe placed in the previously experienced class at all and the\nargument from analogy is wholly inapplicable.\nIf the resemblance is only partial we must proportion-\nately discount our deduced chance of the presence of the\nquality \" B \" (in this case fraud).\nNow although at first sight the fact that this case is\none of a \" physical \"'\nphenomenon may seem sufficient\nto warrant our classing it without more ado with all\nother cases of \" physical \" phenomena, I do not think\nthat this will hold good in practice. In the first place,\nphysical phenomena shade off gradually into non-physical,\nand it is hard to draw any exact boundary between the\ntwo. It would be unwise, for instance, unreservedly to\nclass telekinetic phenomena, such as these, with para-\nkinetic 1\n, or with the obscure manifestations of the \"Direct\nx\nThe distinction between \"telekinetic\" and \" parakinetic \" phenomena is\nthat in the former there is no contact of any kind between the object moved and\nthe members of the circle, whereas in the latter there is contact, but not of a\nkind to account for the observed movements on normal lines. Ordinary \" table-\nturning \" is an example of parakinesis.\n\f320 W. Wliately Smith, [part\nVoice,\" which, if all that is claimed for them be true,\nmust be at least quasi-physical.\nMoreover, the characteristics by which various cases\nare classified for the purpose of forming such an a\npriori expectation must be those presented by them\nbefore the question of their genuineness was decided by\nthe \" reagent \" of a special investigation ad hoc con-\nducted under test conditions, may be, or by particularly\nstringent observers.\nIn other words, the special conditions which determined\nthe frequency of association of the quality \" B \" with\nmembers of the class \" A \" must not be used for defining\nthe class \" A \" or for identifying the object an as a mem-\nber of that class.\nIn this case, for example, it would be fallacious to\nargue that phenomena originally produced in a good light\nare, for the purpose of assessment of the a priori\nchance of fraud, to be counted, without qualification,\nas members of the same class which includes phenomena\noriginally produced in darkness and subsequently found to\nbe fraudulent when the additional factor of good light\nwas added.\nIn fact, all a priori judgments are comparative\njudgments based on evidence available up to a certain\npoint, and it is essential that this point should be the\nsame for the two sets of experiences compared. It may\nbe defined, for present purposes at any rate, as the point\nwhere casual observation ends and systematic observation\nbegins. If we place it later for early cases possessing a\nknown probability of fraudulence we must do the same for\nthe present case, and we are at once committed to the\nformation of a judgment which is not a priori at all.\nIt follows that a priori judgments have their logical\nbasis in the similarity of superficial characteristics, and that\nour resultant expectation must be suitably discounted if\nthe similarity is imperfect.\nI do not pretend, of course, that this reasoning can be\napplied with quantitative precision to this or any other\nspecial case of the type we are considering.\nThe point I wish to make is that we are only entitled\n\flxxvii.] \" The Reality of Psychic Phenomena.\" 321\nto approach the case with a strong expectation of fraud\nif we have first satisfied ourselves that its superficial\ncharacteristics are truly similar to those of cases with\nwhich we have come to associate fraud in the past, and\nwe must discount this expectation in proportion to any\ndissimilarity we may find.\nI have dwelt on this point at some length because\na priori judgments are too commonly formed without\nany real comprehension of the logical processes involved.\nIf now we compare what I have called the superficial\ncharacteristics of these experiments with those of past\ncases of \" physical \" phenomena I think we shall find\na number of points of marked difference. I am somewhat\nhandicapped by writing without books, so I cannot bring\nout these differences point by point, giving chapter and\nverse as I should like to do. But I do not think it\nlikely that anyone well acquainted with the literature\nof the subject could fail to be struck by the difference\nbetween the general \" atmosphere \" of these experiments\nand that of other previous cases of which I suppose that\nof Eusapia Palladino is the classical example. Of special\npoints the following are among the more obvious charac-\nteristics where important differences may be looked for\n:\n(i) The type of phenomenon produced.\n(ii) The order of their intensity.\n(hi) The regularity and ease with which they are pro-\nduced.\n(iv) The degree of light in which they occur.\n(v) Whether the medium is entranced or not.\n(vi) Whether he or she is a paid professional or not.\n(vii) His or her past history.\nI am sure that any comparison of this kind is bound\nto lead us to the conclusion that our a priori preposses-\nsions in favour of fraud must be heavily discounted by\nreason of the difference between the superficial character-\nistics of this and previous cases.1\n1\n1 wish to make it clear that I am not in any way trying to depreciate the\nvalue of the evidence obtained from the study of these \"previous cases,'' which\nwas of the utmost intrinsic value. My point is that the conditions obtaining\nat Belfast have been so different from and, incidentally, better than those of\n\f322 W. Whately Smith. [PART\nIt must be noted that this is an argument from mere\ndifferences as such and is in no way dependent on the\nsense of these differences. It would apply with equal\nforce even if all the differences were of such a nature\nas to increase the suspicion of fraud when forming an\na 'posteriori judgment. This is not the case here as I\nshall now proceed to show.\nFraud is frequently discussed under the two heads of\nConscious and Unconscious, but in this case the distinction\nis unnecessary for the question is one of fact only. Is\nit possible for the medium to produce the phenomena\nobserved by ordinary physical means, in spite of the\nprolonged and close scrutiny of Dr. Crawford and in view\nof their characteristic features ? If it is possible, does\nshe in fact do so ?\nThese are questions which must be answered, and I\nthink that the evidence at our disposal is sufficient\nto enable us to do so with a very high degree of\ncertainty.\nI do not propose to dwell at length on whether there\nmight be a desire or motive for deception, preferring to\ntreat the question as a matter of bare fact.\nNone the less, it is well to point out that the sittings\nat which these phenomena are produced are entirely\nprivate in nature, and therefore cupidity or the desire\nfor notoriety, which may form a powerful incentive in\nthe case of the professional medium, are here entirely\nlacking. Dr. Crawford has never paid a penny for the\nfacilities accorded him\u2014often at the cost of considerable\ninconvenience\u2014by the medium and her family. Nor\ndo the members of the circle encourage the promiscuous\nintroduction of persons other than their own friends ;\nand as a matter of fact, the sittings have recently been\nrestricted solely to scientific work.\nprevious cases that we must exercise considerable care in \"carrying forward \"\npast experience and applying it in this ease.\nThe records of earlier investigators who claim to have obtained levifcations\nwithout contact (cp. Sir William Crookes' \" Researches in Spiritualism \" and the\nNaples experiments with Eusapia Palladino, reported in Proc. S. P. R. , Vol. XXIII.\n)\nare, of course, greatly strengthened, if we accept the Belfast phenomena as\ngenuine.\n\flxxvii.] \" The Reality of Psychic Phenomena.\" 323\nI feel that it amounts to something very like an imper-\ntinence on my part to presume to testify to the integrity\nof those concerned ;\nbut, for the purpose of mere\nscientific record, I may say that the members of the circle\nstruck me as being eminently upright, honourable and\nlikeable people of the best type\u2014quite incapable of\npractising a mean and objectless trickery.\nBut these considerations, however much they may\nweigh with those who have come under their immediate\ninfluence, cannot be expected to appeal with the same\nforce to others who approach the subject only at second\nhand. Nor are they admissible as evidence of the first\norder from the strictly scientific point of view.\nIt is right, therefore, for the purpose of the immediate\ndiscussion, to assume that the desire to deceive may exist,\nand that it may be coupled with the utmost imaginable\ncunning and ingenuity.\nAs already indicated, my own strong opinion is that\nthe phenomena are genuine. To be more specific, I\nbelieve that when the table is levitated it is not supported\neither by the hands or feet of the medium or of any\nmember or members of the circle, or by any mechanical\ncontrivance devised or controlled by her or by them or\nby a confederate. I do not mean by this, of course,\nto dissent from Dr. Crawford's \" cantilever \" theory, with\nwhich I entirely agree ; but this is not a \" mechanical\ncontrivance \" in any usual sense of the word.\nI think the reasons supporting this view may conveni-\nently be divided into two groups. First, there are general\nconsiderations obtained from Dr. Crawford's own records\nand from the comparison of this case with preceding\ncases ;\nand, secondly, those arising from my own personal\nobservations. It should be noted that the latter inevitably\nstrengthen the former. Even a single sitting by an\nindependent observer is a very valuable check on the\noriginal observer's work. Unless I and all other observers\nwho have seen the phenomena are ipso facto suspect, it\neliminates the possibility of Dr. Crawford being mad, or\nhimself implicated in a fraud\u2014and even such far-fetched\npossibilities are worth putting out of court.\n\f324 W. Whately Smith. [part\nAgain, if the main features of a piece of work of this\nkind are substantiated, there is little need to worry about\nthe minor points.\nAs regards general considerations, then, it may first\nbe noted that a comparison of such features of this case\nas exert a direct influence on the possibility of fraud\nwith the corresponding features of preceding cases is\nheavily in favour of these phenomena being genuine.\nThis comparison is, of course, essentially a matter of\nthe sense of differences, not of their mere existence, as was\nthe case when I was discussing the formation of a priori\nprepossessions, and includes the results of \" systematic\nobservation\" as well as the \"superficial characteristics.\"\n(i) It is well known that a trick which appears mystify-\ning at first sight is easier to detect every time that it\nis repeated. Dr. Crawford has observed some hundreds\nof levitations, has worked under and all round the table,\nboth with and without apparatus, and the conditions of\nobservation have been uniformly favourable.\n(ii) The phenomena occur with the utmost regularity.\nIt is easy to make errors of observation when events\ntake the observer by surprise and when it is necessary\nto look for everything at once. But this is not the case\nwhen a phenomenon is repeated again and again at the\nword of command and with variations caused only by the\nobserver's own modifications of conditions, for this means\nthat he can attend to various points one by one and with\nany amount of checking that he pleases.\n(ill) The lighting has been good. This is enormously\nimportant, for our sense of sight is by far the most reliable\nthat we possess, and without its help an investigation is\nvery heavily handicapped. I do not know of any well-\nauthenticated case of phenomena of this intensity occurring\nin a good light, except perhaps those of D. D. Home\nmany years ago. But in this case the light available for\nobservation is undeniably good, although it is, of course,\nto be hoped that Dr. Crawford may ultimately be able\nto use a much stronger light by finding and eliminating\nthe particular wave-lengths which prevent phenomena\ndeveloping.\n\flxxvii.] \" The Reality of Psychic Phenomena.\" 325\n(iv) There is a great difference between quantitative\nand qualitative work. The former, which has been\nabundant in this case, postulates an intimate control of\nthe phenomena and cannot be extensively undertaken\nwhen they are fugitive or sporadic. Conditions must be\nvery good indeed for qualitative observation before they\nbecome possible for quantitative measurements.\n(v) Difficult as it is to see any opening for fraud at\nall, it becomes much more so when we reflect that the\nfraudulent person or persons would have been obliged\nnot only to simulate the phenomena but to \" fake\n\"\nthe readings of the apparatus at the same time, and,\nmoreover, in such a way as to give concordant results\nuniformly pointing towards a definite theory, and main-\ntaining this concordance even in the face of experiments\nespecially designed by Dr. Crawford to test it, and whose\nimport was unknown to the members of the circle.\nDr. Crawford has dealt very thoroughly with this aspect\nof the question on pp. 16-26 of his book, and there is\ntherefore no need for me to enlarge further on it.\n(vi) The research has been continuously conducted\nthroughout by the one observer only\u2014with checks on the\nmain features by various independent observers, such as\nmyself. It is clearly far more difficult for a trickster\nto maintain a deception in the face of continuous observa-\ntion of this kind\u2014unless the chief investigator is quite\nextraordinarily gullible\u2014than it is in cases where the\ninvestigation takes the non-cumulative form of the observa-\ntion of a few sittings each by a series of committees\nwho do not know quite what to look for and who can\neasily be put off, if need be, by a sudden \" failure of\npower,\" \" bad conditions,\" or the like.\n(vii) As already pointed out, there seems no motive for\nfraud.\nIn addition to these general considerations there are\nmore specific reasons for believing fraud to be absent.\nA spurious levitation could be accomplished in one of\nthree ways only\n:\n(a) The medium or one of the other members of the\ncircle might use their hands or feet directly.\n\f326 W. Whately Smith. [part\n(b) They might use hands or feet indirectly, that is to\nsay, by the intermediary of rods, clamps or similar\nappliances.\n(c) A special and elaborate apparatus might be installed,\noperating, e.g. through trap-doors in the floor, and con-\ntrolled either by a member of the circle or by a con-\nfederate.\nThe last possibility is inserted only for the sake of\nlogical completeness. It may be eliminated at once, for,\nin addition to its inherent improbability, it must be re-\nmembered that all the principal phenomena in question\nhave, on occasion, been produced in Dr. Crawford's house\nand in various other rooms. The direct or indirect use\nof hands is also eliminated, because, as already stated,\nI have myself twice seen the sitters raise their joined\nhands above their heads while the table was levitated\nclear of the ground.\nWe are left with the possibihty of the direct or indirect\nuse of feet by the medium or a member of the circle.\nThe members of the circle other than the medium may\nbe left out of the question, because, in the first place,\nall Dr. Crawford's quantitative work goes to show that\nthe medium is primarily responsible for the phenomena,\nand, in the second, during the time I was within the\ncircle myself I moved all round the table except into the\nspace between it and the medium. This would have\nprevented any member of the circle from using his or\nher feet, because my own legs would have been in the\nway.\nThe question, therefore, reduces to whether the medium\nuses her feet or not.\nThe following points seem to me to answer this satis-\nfactorily :\n(i) I tried to lift the table with my feet myself but\nfailed. The legs have no cross-bars and it is impossible\nto get a proper grip.\n(ii) When the table was levitated I was in a position\nto see each leg in turn against the light from the stove\n\u2014\nas already explained\u2014and there was nothing in contact\nwith any of them.\n\flxxvii.] \" The Reality of Psychic Phenomena.\" 327\n(iii) When the table was thrown into the horizontal\nposition with the legs pointing towards the medium there\nwas, naturally, no shadow thrown by its top to hinder\nobservation. In this position all four legs were clearly\nvisible simultaneously and were not in contact with any-\nthing.\n(iv) In the course of the proceedings the table moved\nto a distance of at least four feet from the medium,\nwhich is well beyond the reach of a person sitting up-\nright in a chair.\n(v) The leverage exerted by a ten-pound table at a\nradius of the legs is considerable, as anyone may test for\nthemselves. Even if it were possible for the medium,\nby long practice or the use of specially devised clamps,\nto raise the table from the ground, it would be physically\nimpossible for her to keep it steady for any length of\ntime. This is doubly so when the very heavy pressures\nexerted by myself are taken into account.\n(vi) I know a little of the way muscle behaves when\nfatigued. Throughout the seance the table moved with\na poise and precision which did not at all convey the\nimpression of muscular action.\n(vii) When the table was levitated I tried the effect\nof pushing it in various directions. The direction of\nmaximum resistance was about 45\u00b0 downwards and to-\nwards the medium. This is just about the least favour-\nable angle for resistance on the assumption that the\nmedium was using her feet, because at that angle my\npressure would exert an approximately maximal turning\nmoment about the medium's hips. The direction most\nfavourable for resistance would, of course, be along the\nline of the legs\n\u2014\ni.e. more or less horizontally towards the\nmedium, but somewhat upwards, since she could not raise\nher legs above the horizontal without moving her knees,\nwhich were in full view. In practice the resistance\nwas extraordinary and quite beyond the medium's normal\nphysical power.\n(viii) At the time that I was within the circle until\nI was pushed to its confines by the table, I was within\nthree feet of the medium, and, as already explained,\n\f328 W. Whately Smith. [part\nI could see clearly the whole of her body down to her\nknees. Even if we postulate the most ingenious mechan-\nism for grasping the table and a physical strength on\nthe part of the medium quite disproportionate to her\nweight and general build, it is surely impossible that she\ncould have sat absolutely motionless, as she did, while\nthe table writhed and twisted beneath my hands with\nthe utmost violence.\n(ix) Several times while pushing hard against the table\nI suddenly relaxed my pressure. If the medium had\nbeen pushing against me she could not have restrained a\nsynchronous jerk. No such movement took place.\nIn concluding this account of my reasons for believing\nthe phenomena to be wholly genuine I cannot refrain\nfrom saying that I consider that a certain onus pro-\nbandi rests with those who support the theory of fraud as\nwell as on those who do not. No accusation of trickery\nshould be made unless its author is prepared to show,\nroughly, at any rate, how such trickery could be effected.\nI do not think anyone has answered Dr. Crawford's chal-\nlenge (see pp. 21-26), but, speaking as one to whom the\nexplanation of fraud has always seemed the most likely\nin these cases, I should be exceedingly interested to hear\nof any really plausible explanation on these lines, if any\nreader can produce one, which will cover the facts and con-\ntains a sketch of the '\nmodus operandi.'\nIt may be noted here that Dr. Crawford's work has\nalready had the effect of greatly lightening the labours\nof future students of telekinetic phenomena. When\nnext we find a good case of the type, we need not begin\nde novo groping in the dark. We can get to work\nlight away confirming his fundamental experiments and\nfollowing up the methods which he has inaugurated.\nThis should result in a great economy of time and of\nrare material.\nIV.\nIn view of the reasons which I have adduced in support\nof the genuineness of the phenomena it seems permissible\n\flxxvii.] \" The Reality of Psychic Phenomena.'\" 329\nto conclude with some observations based on the assump-\ntion that fraud may be regarded as eliminated.\nI do not propose to discuss the ultimate origin of the\nphenomena, or whether the controlling intelligence is in-\ncarnate or discarnate, a primary or a secondary person-\nality. Such questions, associated with the problem of\nsurvival, do not constitute the principal and peculiar interest\nof phenomena of this type. The evidence for survival\nmust always reduce to a matter of identity and of identity\nalone, and although the evidential matter necessary for\nits study may be obtained by \" physical \" phenomena\n\u2014\ne.g. by raps\u2014its evidential value, if any, is to be found in\nits content and not in the manner by which it is received.\nThe peculiar interest of telekinetic phenomena lies,\nthen, in their proximate rather than their ultimate causes.\nThere can be no doubt, in this case at least, that they\nare directed by an intelligence of some kind or other,\nand it follows that we have a case of a Consciousness 1\nacting upon matter otherwise than through the usual\nintermediary of brain, nerve and muscle to which we\nare accustomed.\nThis being so, it is clearly probable that a study of\nthe means whereby this control is exercised may throw\nlight on the relation which matter and consciousness bear\nto one another.\nConsciousness normally acts on matter through the body,\nand hitherto we have not succeeded in discovering the\nprecise nature of the connection between the two, largely\nby reason of the experimental difficulties involved.\nIn this case some mechanism, using the word in its\nwidest sense, seems to be employed which must be of a\nvery different nature.\nOn the one hand, since it is under intelligent control,\nit must be in contact, so to speak, with Consciousness ;\non the other, since it affects matter, it must be quasi-\nphysical.\n1 \" Consciousness \" is admittedly a somewhat vague and controversial\nword to use here. It must not be taken as indicating any special philosophic\nor metaphysical doctrine on my part beyond a general belief in the \" trans-\nmissive \" view of the relation between brain and consciousness.\n\f330 W. Whately Smith. [part\nIt forms, as it were, a mean proportional between the\nphysical and mental realms, and if we succeed in elucidat-\ning its precise nature we shall, I believe, have obtained\nthe missing link which will enable us to understand some-\nthing of the relation between the two and to express\nboth in terms of a common and coherent whole.\nThis might almost be described as the primary aim\nof Psychic and Psychological Science.\nThe results so far obtained by Dr. Crawford do not\nenable us to form any definite conclusions on the subject\nof a positive nature. They do, however, allow us to\neliminate certain possibilities with considerable assurance.\nI do not propose to deal with the sort of explanation\nwhich speaks vaguely of undefined \" forces \" or \" negative\ngravity \" or postulates the existence of an \" etheric\nduplicate\" of the material table. These fantastic \"ex-\nplanations \" simply do not explain : for explanation\nconsists essentially of the restatement of the highly obscure\nin terms of the less obscure and is not effected by the\nintroduction of new concepts as unintelligible as the\noriginal problem.\nIt is therefore necessary, in accordance with the uni-\nversal scientific principle of minimum assumption, to\nexhaust all known modes of action and analogues thereof\nbefore launching out into entirely unprecedented lines of\nspeculation.\nThis method has been pursued by Dr. Crawford with\nthe happiest results.\nBefore dealing with the line of explanation to which\nhe has been led I will first mention one or two possibilities\nwhich may be definitely eliminated from the start.\nMatter moves only when force is applied to it, and forces\nmay normally be transmitted in one of two ways only.\n(i) Through the intermediary of matter, e.g. by the\ndirect action of a mechanical structure capable of trans-\nmitting tension, compression, torque or shear, or by the\nimpact of material particles as in the case of the pressure\nof a gas.\n(ii) Without the intervention of matter, that is to say,\nwhen the force is transmitted solely by the ether, as in\n\flxxvii.] \" The Reality of Psychic, Phenomena.\" 331\nelectrical or magnetic actions or gravitation. In all\ncases of this class the forces obey the law of inverse\nsquares and are propagated rectilinearly.\nThe whole of this second type of force transmitted may\nsafely be rejected at once. The behaviour of the table\nin no way resembles the effect of any of the forces com-\nprised in this group. I am sure that no one who has\nseen the phenomena and has any acquaintance with the\nnature of electro-magnetic forces could possibly think\nthat the movements of the table are produced by the\naction of any force obeying the inverse square law and\nemanating from the medium or any other source or\nsources.\nThe same applies to any supposition that the table is\nbombarded by a stream of material particles projected\nfrom the medium or elsewhere. This idea is negatived\nby the normal absence of any reaction on the floor verti-\ncally under the table, by the failure of a manometer\nto detect any pressure and by the extreme rapidity\nwith which the force changes its direction.\nI may say, however, that although this line of explana-\ntion seems untenable in its simplest form, I should not\nbe surprised to find that it entered into the complete\nexplanation in a modified form and in an ancillary\ncapacity.\nAs opposed to these possibilities, with which the observed\nphenomena present no analogy, we find a striking and\nindeed perfect resemblance to the simplest of all forms\nof force transmission, namely, a rigid structure.\nThe direction and magnitude of the forces measured\ncorrespond accurately with those which would obtain,\nif the connection between the medium and the table\nwere a material beam of a certain shape and possessing\nconsiderable rigidity.\nDr. Crawford has been at pains to test this hypothesis\nby deduction and experiment, and the results have been\nuniformly coherent and confirmatory. We may therefore\nsay, at least, that although we can neither see nor feel\nany material structure between the medium and the table,\nyet the latter behaves precisely as if such a structure\n\f332 W. Whatehj Smith. [PAET\nwere there. Not only is this the case as regards the\nforces called into play during the phenomena, but, in\naddition, it is possible to locate the structure and to\ndetermine approximately its size and form by observing\nin what positions an interposed solid object causes the\nlevitated table to drop, and by tracing out the lines of\nstress in the space between the medium and the table.\nThese methods confirm the conclusions drawn from measure-\nments of the forces.\nAt this point we are faced by a somewhat awkward\ndilemma. Short of denying the facts\u2014a course which I\nhold to be unjustifiable on the evidence\u2014we must admit\none of two things.\nEither we must say that there exists a concatenation\nof forces of an entirely unknown nature and so adjusted\nas to produce a perfect but illusory simulacrum of a\nrigid cantilever, or we must admit that there can exist\na material, or quasi-material, structure which combines\nthe properties of rigidity and impalpability.\nThe former is in every Avay unsatisfactory ; it is un-\nprecedented and quite fails to throw any real light on\nthe subject. The latter is a mechanical contradiction in\nterms.\nNone the less, it is the second alternative which I\nthink we should adopt. Most, if not all, scientific dis-\ncoveries have originated in the observation of facts which\nat first sight have appeared incompatible, and have\nremained so until the unifying clue has been forth-\ncoming.\nI believe that the whole essence of the problem before\nus in this case lies in the reconciliation of these contra-\ndictory properties of the cantilever.\nWhen we have solved the secret of its rigidity\u2014or\neven got so far as to imagine any means whereby that\nrigidity could be obtained\u2014I believe we shall hold in our\nhands the key which will in time unlock most of the\nclosed doors which at present confront us in the investiga-\ntion of Psychic forces.\nAt the present time I do not think that we are in a\nposition even to adumbrate the final solution of the\n\flxxvii.] \" The Reality of Psychic Phenomena.\" 333\nmystery, and in this vague and somewhat unsatisfactory\nstate I must be content to leave the subject.\nBut before we can hope to solve any problem we must\nfirst be assured of the phenomena, which give rise to it,\nand then narrow the investigation down to the minimum\nnumber of specific points by the elimination of all\nirrelevant details and untenable possibilities.\nIt is in these preliminary steps that I hope the pre-\nceding paragraphs may be of some slight value.\n\f334 Sir William Barrett. [part\nV.\nREPORT OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA TAKING PLACE\nAT BELFAST WITH DPv. CRAWFORD'S MEDIUM,\nread to the Council of the S.P.R. on January 8, 1916.\nBy Sir William Barrett, F.R.S.\nDr. Crawford, lecturer on Mechanical Engineering at\nthe Queen's University and Technical College, Belfast,\nhas for several months been investigating the remarkable\nphysical phenomena which take place in a small family\ncircle of working people in Belfast. The medium is the\neldest daughter, Kathleen, a girl of about seventeen.\nDr. Crawford has described in Light the very interesting\nmechanical arrangements he has devised to test the weight\nof the medium simultaneously with that of the table\nwhich is levitated, and also of the forces apparently eman-\nating from the medium, and has determined the direction\nas well as amount of these forces.\nThrough Dr. Crawford's kindness I was permitted to\njoin the circle in Belfast, during the Christmas vacation,\n1915, and was allowed to bring with me a medical friend,\nDr. W., who kindly consented to make any pathological\nor physical examinations of the medium that might be\nnecessary.\nThe sitting took place at the residence of the medium's\nfamily, a small upper room having been regularly used for\nthe sittings. This room was lighted by an incandescent\ngas burner, and a flat flame gas burner inside a\nlamp with a large pane of red glass on the side facing\nthe circle. The circle of seven persons sat round a small\ntable and each clasped hands with the adjoining sitter.\nWe sat just outside, and close to, the circle. After\nsome hymns had been sung, the gas burner was turned off,\n\flxxvii.] Report of Physical Phenomena. 335\nand the red light illuminated the room \u2022 sufficiently to\nenable us to see the sitters and the table. The gas flame\ninside the red lantern was at my request subsequently\nraised, so that there was quite enough light to see the\nobjects and sitters in the room. A tin trumpet stood\nbeloAV the table, the latter had four legs, with no cross\nbar on two sides, but a cross bar between the legs on the\ntwo shorter sides, away from the medium.\nKnocks soon came and answered questions. Three\nknocks for yes, two for doubtful, and one for no. Mes-\nsages were also slowly spelt out by repeating the alphabet\naloud, a knock coming at the right letter. The knocks\nappeared in some cases to come from the table, at others\nfrom outside the circle. Suddenly a very loud knock\ncame in response to a request, and was repeated with\nviolence. Dr. W. asked for it to be still louder, and\na tremendous bang then came, which shook the room and\nresembled the blow of a sledge hammer on an anvil.\nAfter the sitting we examined the feet of the sitters and\nall had felt slippers on, except one who had light shoes,\nand none could have produced these sounds with their\nfeet.\nThen came some remarkable sounds resembling the\nsawing of wood, the boring of timber, and the bouncing\nof a ball. First a small ball bouncing up and down,\nand then apparently a larger ball bouncing up and down,\nthe gradual dying away of the sounds as the ball came\nto rest very cleverly reproduced.\nThe trumpet below the table then began to move about,\nand the smaller end poked itself from under the top of\nthe table towards Dr. W. and myself. We were allowed\nto try and catch it, but in spite of all our endeavours\nit eluded us, darting in and out and changing its position\nas we tried to seize it. The medium was on the opposite\nside of the table to us and all the circle held up their\nhands\u2014so that we could see each linked hand clearly\n\u2014\nas the trumpet played hide and seek with us.\nThen the table began to rise from the floor, until it\nreached a height of some twelve or eighteen inches, and\nremained thus suspended and quite level. We were\n\f336 Sir William Barrett. [part\nallowed, first myself and then Dr. W., to go beneath\nthe clasped hands of the sitters into the circle and\ntry to force the table down. This both of us found it\nimpossible to do ;\nthough we laid hold of the sides of the\ntable it resisted our strongest efforts to push it down. I\nthen sat on the table when it was about a foot off the\nfloor and it swayed me about, finally tipping me off.\nWe then returned outside the circle, when the table\nturned itself upside down and moved up and down with\nthe legs uppermost. Again we entered the circle and\ntried to lift the table top from the floor, but it appeared\nriveted, and we were unable to stir it. When we resumed our\nplace outside the circle, the table floated up and turned\nitself over again with its right side uppermost. During\nthese experiments and whilst the table was levitated, all\nthe sitters repeatedly held up their clasped hands, so that\nwe could see no one had any contact with the table, they\nwere in fact so far from it that we could walk between\nthem and the table.\nOther knockings came, and then the knocks bid us good-\nnight by rapping two or three times to each person in\nsuccession, particularly loud knocks being given to Dr.\nW. and myself.\nThe circle then sang the Doxology, and offered up\nprayer, and the sitting terminated.\nThe next evening Dr. Crawford had arranged his tests\nwith weighing machines, and Dr. W. took the pulse and\nbreathing of the medium, with the object of noting\nany change during the manifestations. After half an\nhour of waiting and hymns, knocks came and a message\nwas sjDelt out, \" We are sorry we cannot give any demon-\nstrations to-night.\" Asked if we, the visitors, were the\ncause, \" No \" was replied. Could we remove the cause ?\n\" No.\" Was the cause on their side, a spiritual one ?\n\" No.\" Was it a material cause ? \" Yes.\"\nAfter the previous sitting Dr. W. had made some trials\nof lifting the table by putting the feet beneath the short\ncross bars of the table. This could be done clumsily, and\nthe table raised (but not level) for a few inches. So the\nnext evening we went provided with a long strip of paper\n\flxxvii.] Report of Physical Phenomena. 337\nto paste round the lower part of the table, to prevent\nthese cross bars being used if the medium attempted to\nlift the table in this way. What was our surprise to find\nthe cross bars had been sawn off close to the legs ; then\nwe were told that our trials had shown that the table\ncould be partly lifted by the feet under the cross bars,\nand so thej^ had sawn off the bars to remove any sus-\npicion. We asked the unseen friends if this caused the\nmanifestation to cease, and were told \" no,\" but we should\nhave asked them about it beforehand. Finally we were\nled to infer the material cause was in the medium herself.\nAfter the circle had broken up Dr. W. remained behind\nand examined the medium, and found that she was\nsuffering from a feminine disorder that evening. It was\nuseless to sit again until the medium was well, so we\nreturned to Dublin the next day ; but were cordially\ninvited to .go again later on. which I hope to do.\n[Since Sir William Barrett has had no further opportunity of\nstudying Miss Kathleen Golighers phenomena, we now print his\nshort preliminary report as given above. Ed.]\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART LXXVIII.\nDecember, 1919.\nON A SERIES OF SITTINGS WITH MRS. OSBORNE\nLEONARD.\nBy Miss Radclyffe-Hall and (Una) Lady Troubridge.\nINTRODUCTION.\nWhen extracts from this paper were read at the meetings\nof the Society in January and March 1918, we mentioned\nthe possibility of the publication, at a later date, of a\nfuller report on the series of sittings held by us with\nMrs. Osborne Leonard between August, 1916, and August,\n1917.\nAs is well known, Mrs. Leonard is a professional medium,\nand she has always received her customary fee from us.\nWe are well aware that many members of the Society\nlook askance upon professional mediums, and that the\nattitude of the Society as a whole has always been\nlargely sceptical of evidence received through paid\nmediumship. Mrs. Leonard is more or less at the\ndisposal of any member of the public who can prove\nhim or herself a bona fide inquirer. Therefore, as we\npropose to base this paper on evidence received through\na professional medium, we feel that it is incumbent upon\nus to preface that evidence by a short resume of the\n\f340 Miss Radclyffe-Hatt and Lady Trouhridge. [part\ncircumstances connected with our earliest investigations\nof Mrs. Leonard's phenomena.\n1 1\nfirst heard of Mrs. Leonard through a lady who\nhad written to Mr. J. Arthur Hill for advice. As far as\nI can remember this was either at the end of July or\nat the beginning of August, 1916. This lady requested\nme to test Mrs. Leonard on my own behalf and hers,\nfor although I was not an experienced investigator, she\nconsidered that I should be an impartial judge of evidence\nreceived. I therefore went to Mrs. Leonard's flat to\narrange for a sitting. Mrs. Leonard was away, and a\nfriend of hers who was taking charge of the flat, told me\nthat it would be necessary for her to write to Mrs. Leonard,\nand requested me to leave my name and address. This\nI refused to do, promising to call again in three days\ntime for my answer. In three days time I did so, and\nan appointment was given me for August 16th, 1916,\nat 3 p.m. On leaving Mrs. Leonard's flat I went directly\nto the station, and thence to the country, not returning\nto London till the day of the sitting. I addressed no\nconversation to Mrs. Leonard prior to my sitting, beyond\nthanking her for the appointment, and she went quietly\ninto trance. Her control, Feda, began by describing a\nyoung soldier ;\nI did not recognise him, and said so,\nasking if there were no other communicators wishing to\nspeak. It seemed that there were, for I very soon got\nthe description of a great friend of mine who had died\nsome months previously. Later on we shall give an\nextract from that first sitting.\nThe description was brief, but unmistakeable ;\nexcept\nmy friend, whom it fitted exactly, I had lost no one\nto whom it corresponded ' in the very least. After Mrs.\nLeonard had been in trance for what I think must have\nbeen a little over half an hour, Feda complained that\nmy friend was an inexperienced communicator, and would\nprobably get on much better if I had a table-sitting.\nFeda therefore withdrew and the medium awoke suddenly. I\n1\nThroughout this paper the first person singular refers to Miss Radcryffe-\nHall, by whom extracts from it were read at two meetings of the Society\non January 31st and March 22nd, 1918.\n\flxxvue.] Introduction. 341\ntold Mrs. Leonard what had happened and we had a\ntable-sitting. Mrs. Leonard had both her hands on the\ntable, but for the best part of the time only one of my\nhands rested on the table, as I was taking notes with\nthe other. My friend immediately gave her full name\nthrough the table, though I should have preferred her\nnot to do so. She also gave the name of a place to\nwhich we had been together. When the table spelt out\n\" Do you remember a place we went to, called\n\u2014\nI instantly thought of Orotava, a town that had been\nvisited by my friend and myself. For some reason I\nfelt almost certain that this name would come, but,\ncuriously enough, instead of getting it I got the name\n\" Watergate.\" I recognised the name, and asked if it\nhad another name as well, to which the table replied,\n\" Yes, Bay.\" Now Watergate Bay was the last place\nvisited by myself and my friend prior to her death. We\nfully realise that the influence of the subliminal and\nsupraliminal minds must to a certain extent be dis-\ncounted, especially in table- sittings, when at least one of\nthe sitters is cognisant of the facts given ; and although\nwhat was given at this sitting appears to eliminate con-\nscious fraud, nothing was obtained through the table\nwhich could not be accounted for by unconscious muscular\nguidance by those who incline to that hypothesis. It\nwill remain for the reader to decide at the end of our\npaper, whether another hypothesis, namely, that of tele-\npathy between the living, is an adequate explanation of\nthe subsequent trance-sittings with which we propose to\ndeal.\nAfter the first sitting, at which I alone was present,\nacting as my own recorder, I had another table-sitting\nwith Mrs. Leonard on August 25th, 1916, for the benefit\nof the lady through whom I had originally heard of Mrs.\nLeonard. This lady accompanied me in order to take\nnotes. We were, of course, both anonymous. The results\nof this second table sitting were practically nil. Mrs.\nLeonard complained that the weather was very damp.\nFor whatever reason, there was an immense amount of\nconfusion and no sensible messages were obtained for either\n\f342 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nmy friend or myself. I did not again go to Mrs. Leonard\nuntil October 2nd, 1916, when I visited her together with\nLady Troubridge. We went as anonymous sitters recom-\nmended by Sir Oliver Lodge. I asked Mrs. Leonard\nwhether she remembered me ; she said that she thought she\ndid, but could not be certain as she saw so many people.\nI took the sitting, Lady Troubridge acting as recorder.\nThe control Feda recognised me immediately, not by\nname, of course, but as having sat before. After this\nsitting of October 2nd, 1916, we arranged for a series of\nregular sittings. For the first five months of our weekly\nsittings with this medium\u2014and we sat sometimes\noftener than once a week\u2014neither Lady Troubridge nor\nI ever visited her alone, one or other of us always acting\nas recorder. The recorder bore specially in mind the\nimportance of taking down everything said by the sitter,\nand equally careful notes were made of any conversations\nheld with the medium in a normal state, before and\nafter the sittings, which conversations were invariably\nbrief.\nThere is another statement which we think it is well\nto make. During those early sittings descriptions were\nreceived of The White Cottage, at Malvern Wells, a house\nmuch loved by my deceased friend and myself, together\nwith a description of characteristic features of the neigh-\nbourhood and references to the neighbours.\nThere appeared to be only two possible explanations\nof the descriptions in question : either the knowledge\ndisplayed by Mrs. Leonard, when in trance, was obtained\nin some supernormal manner ; or else pretty extensive\nenquiries had been made in the neighbourhood of Malvern\nWells. We had absolutely no reason to doubt Mrs.\nLeonard's integrity, but it must be borne in mind that\nmy friend's name had been received through the table,\nand that we had in those days very little first-hand\nknowledge of Mrs. Leonard's phenomena. It has always\nappeared to us that those who are engaged upon such\na momentous investigation as that of phenomena pur-\nporting to be occasioned by discamate human beings,\nshould leave no stone unturned to make each step of the\n\fLXXVIII.] Introduction. 343\nground as sure as possible before proceeding. I therefore\nfelt it incumbent upon me to employ a good detective\nagency, and from this agency I received a report on\nNovember 14th, 1916.\nAs the result of their investigations at Malvern Wells\nand in the surrounding district, it was ascertained that\nno enquiries regarding myself or my deceased friend had\nbeen made from any likely sources of information since\nher death. No such enquiries would have been made prior\nto her death by a fraudulent medium, as during her life-\ntime neither she, nor I, nor Lady Troubridge had ever\nvisited a medium, or taken any interest in Psychical\nResearch.\nThe detective also by my instructions made some\nenquiries in London, but here again he failed to discover\nanything suspicious. As, however, the description of The\nWhite Cottage touched upon its interior, I did not stop short\nat the detective's report. I wrote to the lady who had\ntaken possession of the house immediately after I left,\nand I fear that I descended to subterfuge in order to\navoid creating a bias. I worded my letter as expressing\nthe hope that a person from the Colonies, known to\nmy deceased friend and myself, and who had expressed\na wish to see over the house, had been permitted to\ndo so. It struck us at the time that some pretext\nof this sort would probably be used by a fraudulent\nperson wishing to gain admittance to the house. From\nthe lady I obtained a reply to the effect that no\nfriend had called at The White Cottage requesting to see\nover it. At a later date Lady Troubridge and I visited\nMalvern Wells ourselves for the purpose of making some\nenquiries personally, the results of which again proved\nfavourable to the medium. I also wrote to my former\nhead-gardener at The White Cottage, who had joined the\nArmy, but who, as I knew, was in the habit of visiting\nMalvern Wells from time to time, and he assured me that\nnobody had ever questioned him regarding myself or my\ndeceased friend. All the correspondence with regard to this\nmatter of investigating Mrs. Leonard's honesty is in our\npossession.\n\f344 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nWe have recently informed Mrs. Leonard of the fact\nthat detectives were employed by us in connection with\nher phenomena, and she fully realised that the reports\nfurnished by the detectives represented a valuable testi-\nmonial to the genuineness of her powers.\nWith regard to the extracts from the sittings with\nwhich we propose to deal, the purporting communicator\nhas on every occasion except one been my friend of\nwhom a description was given at the first sitting. On\nthe one occasion when she was not the principal com-\nmunicator, I was given to understand at a later sitting\nthat she had been instrumental in helping Feda to get\nmessages through. My friend will be alluded to in the\nsittings as A. V. B., I shall appear as M. R. H., and\nLady Troubridge as U. V. T. Feda is in the habit of\naddressing me as \" Mrs. Twonnie,\" her own version of\nthe name by which I am often called, and Lady Trou-\nbridge as \"Mrs. Una.\" During the sittings, Feda has\ngradually acquired the habit of calling A. V. B. \" Ladye,\"\na nickname which belonged to her in life, and was\ngiven spontaneously through Feda at an early sitting.\nOf Feda we need say very little, as she is already known\nto the public through Sir Oliver Lodge's book Raymond.\nThroughout the sittings we have in our records, for\nthe sake of brevity and clarity, treated the medium,\nduring her trance, as being non-existent, except in those\ninstances when Feda alludes to her as \" my medium,\"\nor \" this one,\" etc. We have assumed that Feda takes\nher place, or at times A. V. B., and have attributed\nto these controls all words spoken by, or movements made\nby Mrs. Leonard. For instance, it will be noticed that\nin the records, we say: \"Feda touches her forehead,\" etc.,\ninstead of :\n\" Feda touches the medium's forehead,\" or :\n\" Mrs. Leonard touches her forehead.\" In our records\nwe have not closely followed Feda's broken English, it\nwould have taken too long to think out suitable spelling\nfor her idiosyncrasies. Her knowledge of the English\nalphabet is shaky, and although she will at times recognise\nand mention letters quite accurately, at other times she\nappears to be at a loss, and is reduced to attempting to\n\fLXXVIII.] Introduction. 345\ndraw with her finger the letters that are apparently shown\nher, or to such descriptions as :\n\" It's a curly letter like\na snake, or ''It's like a cross without a top.\" She will\ngenerally speak of O as a little circle, and she will also\ndescribe any letter that has a stroke above or below the\nline, as, for instance, small Y or B, as \" a long letter,\"\nwhile others, such as small U or E, are \"little letters.\"\nHer English varies ; it is almost correct when she purports\nto be repeating a message verbatim, and at all times is\nquite intelligible in spite of its eccentricities.\nAs throughout the following Paper we propose to deal\nexclusively with the purporting attempt of discarnate\nintelligences to communicate evidential matter, we have,\nin some of the longer extracts from sittings, occasionally\nomitted remarks interlarded by Feda, concerning conditions\nin the \" spirit world,\" etc. In order, however, to do full\njustice to the sustained and consecutively coherent nature\nof the sittings, it is only fair to state that these remarks\nof Eeda's, although non-evidential, were seldom irrelevant,\nbeing usually in the nature of parallels suggested by the\ntopic in hand.\nIt may perhaps be as well to remark here that the records\nof our sittings have always been copied by hand, or typed,\non the afternoon of the day upon which the sitting took\nplace. Of course, since the original notes were made,\nsome few facts have come to light, and occasionally our\nmemory has afforded a further verification of certain\nincidents ; this has led to some trifling modifications of,\nor additions to, our original annotations appended to the\nrecords. OccasionaUy, also, mature consideration, consequent\nupon a deeper study of the sittings, has thrown a new\nlight on some of Feda's statements.\nIn view of. the fact that evidential pantomime is some-\ntimes a feature of the Leonard phenomena, it is necessary\nto mention the amount of light permitted by Mrs. Leonard\nduring the sittings. Mrs. Leonard does not sit in full\ndaylight\u2014the sittings are held with drawn curtains, by\nthe fight of a shaded lamp. This lamp is placed in front\nof the recorder, who, when two people are present,\nsits a few feet away from the medium. During the\n\f346 Miss Badclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nsummer time, therefore, when there is no fire, it is\nnot always possible for the recorder to distinguish\nclearly gestures made by the medium. The recorder\nat these times depends partially upon the sitter to\ndescribe the gestures verbally one by one as they are\nmade, the light being always sufficient to render all\ngestures and the facial expression of the medium\nclearly visible to the sitter, who is placed directly in\nfront of her, sometimes in contact with her hand and\nsometimes not. When only one person is present and\nthe sitter takes his or her own notes, the table upon\nwhich the lamp stands is placed quite close to the medium,\nand there is often little or no contact, the sitter requiring\nboth hands free. During the winter months it is never\nnecessary for the sitter to describe verbally to the recorder\nany gestures that are made, as, owing to the fact that\nMrs. Leonard feels the cold when she comes out of trance,\nthere is always a very large fire in the grate, which, in\naddition to the lamp, makes a sufficient illumination for\nthe recorder as well as the sitter to observe all move-\nments made by the medium. But as the recorder is naturally\nlooking down to write, our method has been for the\nsitter to call the recorder's attention to any pantomime\nby saying :\n\" Feda is making a gesture for you to record,\"\nor: \"Watch Feda's gestures,\" or words to that effect.\nOur thanks are due to Feda for the full and accurate\nrecords which we have been able to obtain. She has\nalways shown the greatest solicitude on this point, re-\npeating slowly and carefully, more than once, anything\nintricate that appeared to her to be of evidential value ;\nunlike most controls she can be stopped with impunity\nshould the recorder be in fear of getting behind-hand,\nand yet cleverly take up the thread the moment she is told\nthat the recorder is ready. We have both remarked that she\noften appears to have a curious knowledge of the exact\nstage in the notes that the recorder has reached, and has\nbeen known to rebuke the communicator, saying :\n\" Don't\nspeak so quickly; Mrs. Twonnie \" (or \"Mrs. Una,\" as\nthe case may be) hasn't got that down yet,\" and at other\ntimes, when the sitter has enquired whether the recorder\n\fLXXVIII.] Introduction. 347\nis ready, Feda will answer glibly and correctly for the\nrecorder: \"Oh, yes, she's got that down all right,\" or\nthe contrary. The above has been our experience ;\npossibly\nwe have been particularly fortunate, owing perhaps to\nthe fact that a very real mutual liking has grown up\nbetween ourselves and Feda. This, we have been given\nto understand, is not invariably the case.\n\f348 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nCHAPTER I.\nDescription by Feda op Communicator's Personal\nAppearance as Evidence of Identity.\nThe first evidence with which we shall deal is that relating\nto personal appearance and conditions as a proof of identity,\nwhen given through a control who purports to be in\ntouch with the communicating spirit ; and in this connec-\ntion we shall give a few extracts from early sittings,\nbeginning with my first sitting of August 16th, 1916, at\nwhich I was my own recorder.\nWe will begin the extract after Feda's description of\nthe unknown soldier aforementioned.\nM. R. H. I do not know him, is there no one else ?\nF. Yes, there's a lady of about sixty years old, perhaps.\nM. Pv. H. Please describe her, she interests me more. (Feda\ndid not take the hint, however, but continued\nto describe the soldier, who appeared to be very\ninsistent.)\nM. R. H. Please leave him ; as I do not know him, I am\nafraid I cannot help, though I would do any-\nthing I could. Will you describe the lady of\nabout sixty 1\nF. The lady is of medium height, has rather a good\nfigure but is inclined to be too fat, Feda thinks ;\nshe has a straight nose, a well shaped face, but\nthe face is inclined to lose its outline a little.\nThe eyebrows are slightly arched, her hair is\nnot done fashionably.\nM. R. H. Is it worn in the neck ?\nF. No, it's done on the crown of her head. She has\npassed over quite recently. She had not been\nwell for some time prior to passing, she was\n\fLxxvni.] Communicator's Personal Appearance 349\nsometimes conscious of this, but put it behind\nher. Feda doesn't mean to say that she worried\nover it much, or that she suffered much, she\ndidn't. Feda thinks she didn't know how ill she\nreally was. She went about doing things just as\nusual, she gives Feda the impression of internal\nweakness. You were much with her in her earth\nlife, you gave her vitality, you kept her up with\nyour vitality . . . The lady's eyes look to Feda\nto be dark, perhaps grey.\nRegarding this description : A. V. B. was fifty-seven\nwhen she died, had had a fine figure, but latterly be-\ncame too stout ; she had a straight nose, which was\nvery slightly tip-tilted, she wore her hair dressed high\non her head, and, at the time of this sitting, she had\nonly been dead two months three weeks and a day. For\nsome time prior to her death she had not been strong,\npartly owing to the effects of a bad motor accident. She\nmust often have put her ailments behind her, however,\nand we do not think for a moment that she had any idea\nof how ill she was ; I can only say that I had none.\nShe went about doing things as usual up to the very\nday of her last illness, which came on without the slightest\nwarning. She did suffer from internal weakness, though\nthis had nothing to do with her death. A. V. B. and I\nwere the closest friends for eight years, and lived together\nfor a great part of that time. She would sometimes say\nto me that she believed that my vitality kept her up and\nhelped her ; we used to discuss this together. A. V. B.'s\neyes were of a dark blue, some people might have called\nthem of a dark bluey-grey colour.\nAfter these details had been obtained through Mrs.\nLeonard's trance, together with descriptions fairly appli-\ncable to some of my deceased relations, Mrs. Leonard was\nawakened by Feda, for the purpose of the table-sitting\nmentioned above. This table- sitting was very brief, and\ncontained nothing evidential beyond the points already\nquoted.\nOn October 2nd, 1916, I took a sitting with Mrs.\n\f350 Miss Baddyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nLeonard, Lady Troubridge acting as recorder. After\na few words of greeting the sitting opened by Feda\nrecognising the communicator as the lady whom she had\nseen at my first sitting. I asked Feda to describe her\nagain, and she did so accurately and much more fully\nthan on the first occasion. There are a few points of\ninterest that we must quote from this second description ;\nthey are as follows :\nF. Not a young, rather an elderly lady, bringing\nagain the funny feeling in her legs, no circu-\nlation in her legs, cold and numb. She must have\nhad that before she died. She is about medium\nheight, in build not exactly fat, but rather\nspreaded out. She has a nice-shaped face and\na very humorous look, as if she'd smile over\nthings and have jokes with you that other people\ndidn't come into. She looks elderly but has a\nyoung soul ; she is laughing ; she was about\nsixteen sometimes, she never grew old in soul,\nher body was a nuisance to her. She was always\nwanting to do things that she could not do.\nA little later on Feda says :\nF. She has regular features, with character, a firm\nchin, not prominent, round, she has lost the\nshape of her face a bit, it's a little flabby under\nthe chin\u2014mouth medium size\u2014not very red,\nwhich makes the lips not look full. Eyes deep\nset, she doesn't open them very wide, that's\nwhy Feda can't tell their colour. She looks\nsideways at people sometimes, without moving\nher head, she's looking at you like that now.\nAnd later on still in this sitting :\nM. R. H. Ask her if she suffered much when she died.\nF. She says not as much as one would think. Some-\nthing had come up to her head, and before she\npassed over worked up to the brain, and formed\na small clot on some part of the brain that\nstopped her feeling. It doesn't seem to worry\n\flxxviii.] Communicator s Personal Appearance. 351\nher, but she wants to know if that is what\nhappened.\nM. R. H. Yes, that is what happened.\nF. It pressed, and prevented her feeling.\nM. R. H. Was she frightened ?\nF. She says :\n\" When I woke up it felt strange, I had\nan idea I was still dreaming, I had rather strange\ndreams, I don*t know if I told anyone. Often\nI was half awake and half asleep.\"\nM. R. H. Quite right ; did she know me at all ?\nF. She says it's hard to explain, but yes, she did\nknow you, but was not sure if you were part\nof the drearn, or real. She says : \"I could feel\nyou. You seemed to be mentally impressing me\nwith all your might with \"\n\u2014\n(sotto voce : Old\nLady, old Lady, oh, Lady ?) She says you\nsaid :\n'\nOh ! Ladye, oh ! Ladye it's all right.\"\n\" And now and again holding me physically as if\nwanting to hold me up.\" Did she ever choke\nin her throat ? because she's just put her arm\naround you for a minute, and Feda felt her\nphysical body.\nThe first point of interest in the above extract occurs\nwhen Feda says, regarding the numbness, etc., in the legs :\n\" Bringing again a funny feeling in her legs.\" As A. V. B.\ndied of a stroke, Feda's description of the sensations is\nperfectly correct, but why she uses the word\n\u00a3i\nagain \" is\nnot apparent, since, during my sitting of August 16th,\n1916, she never described any sensations of this nature.\nAs will be remembered, on that occasion, she only alluded\nto internal weakness, which although correct had nothing\nto do with death-conditions. As Feda says in the present\nsitting, A. V. B. had a very humorous look, and it was\ncertainly her custom to have many jokes with me, in\nwhich other people were not always included. A. V. B.\nhad a very strong sense of humour. She also had what may\nbe called a young soul, retaining up to the last an almost\nchildish enjoyment of things ; that her body became a\nnuisance to her is perfectly true, and Feda is right in\n\f352 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nsaying that she always wanted to do things that she\nwas unable to do. Owing to her failing health she was\nprevented from enjoying exercise, such as walking, or\nswimming, a sport to which she was devoted.\nA. V. B. had rather deep-set eyes, and often kept her\nlids lowered. She never in fact opened her eyes very\nwide. But the striking part of the description, to me who\nknew her so well, comes when Feda remarks that she\nwas in the habit of looking at people sideways, without\nmoving her head. This sidelong glance was extraordinarily\ncharacteristic of A. V. B. I had often remarked on it to\nher during her lifetime.\nAs we have said already, A. V. B. died of an apoplectic\nseizure. There was cerebral haemorrhage which formed\na clot on the brain, and this led to progressive paralysis.\nShe lay for eleven days prior to her death with only\noccasional flashes of semi-consciousness. A. V. B. lost all\npower of coherent speech almost immediately after her\nseizure ; we find Feda, however, saying that A. V. B.\nwondered whether she had told anyone of her strange\ndreams. She could not, of course, have actually told\nanyone anything, though one cannot be certain as to how far\nshe was conscious of this loss of speech ;\noccasionally she\nused to make inarticulate sounds, as though trying to\nspeak.\nAs we have already said, A. V. B.'s nickname was\n\" Ladye \" : during her illness, when speaking to her, I most\ncertainly said, \"Oh, Ladye,\" on several occasions; I never\ncalled A. V. B. \" old lady \" in my fife, and this indecision\non Feda's part as to whether the words used were \" Oh,\nLadye \" or \" old lady \" is rather enlightening, as showing,\nit appears to us, the bias occasionally given to certain\nmessages owing to preconceived ideas on the part of the\ncontrol. \" Ladye \" being an unusual nickname, Feda cannot\nquite believe, apparently, that she has heard correctly.\n\" Old Lady \" is a more familiar form of address to Feda ;\nshe therefore decides to try both.\nThe choking in the throat referred to by Feda is\nperfectly correct ;\nowing to the paralysis, A. V. B. had\ndifficulty in swallowing. With regard to my holding\n\flxxviii.] Communicator's Personal Appearance. 353\nA. V. B. up physically, I did so, but only to the best\nof my belief on one occasion.\nWe next come to a Leonard sitting of October 9th,\n1916 ; I took the sitting and Lady Troubridge was the\nrecorder. Speaking of A. V. B., Feda says :\nF. She looks much better than when Feda saw her last.\nM. R. H. Can you tell me the colour of her hair 1\nF. Brown like this one's, Feda thinks. (Here Feda\ntouches the medium's hair.) But she does it high\nup, not in her neck.\nLater on in the sitting I asked whether A. V. B.\nrealised that her death had come as a great shock to me,\nas I had not known that she was seriously ill. I gave no\ndetails or clues regarding the nature of her illness. Feda\nreplied to my question as follows :\nF. She says: \"Of course you didn't know I was ill,\nI didn't know it myself until too late ;\nperhaps\nit was coming on for some time. I couldn't\nexpect you to know what I didn't know myself.\"\nAnd again :\nF. She says nothing could have been done for her,\nunless something had been done to her whole\nsystem, not only a part of it, two or three years\nago, and that would only have kept it at bay.\nShe says after all she was spared suffering and\na long illness.\nNow regarding the above extract, A. V. B.'s hair was\nbrown, but considerably darker in colour than the medium's.\nWe have repeatedly noticed that one of Feda's weakest\npoints is describing the colour of people's hair. A. V. B.\nhad spent a pleasant afternoon, and had actually felt well\nenough to sing at a tea-party on the very day that she\nwas taken ill ;\nit is therefore logical to suppose that, as\nFeda says, she herself was quite as unconscious of the\ngravity of her condition as I was. Undoubtedly, however,\nthe illness had been coming on for some time past. In\nthe opinion of certain doctors who attended her during\nher last illness, A. V. B. must have been suffering for\n\f354 Miss Badclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [pabt\nseveral years from arterial sclerosis, and throughout this\ntime her blood pressure must have been such as to\nconstitute a serious danger. To have checked these\nmaladies, radical steps should have been taken several\nyears before. These steps would have necessitated a total\nalteration in her diet and. her whole habit of life, and\npresumably, as Feda states, something wovdd have had\nto be done for her whole system ; but even had these\nsteps been taken the trouble would only have been\nkept at bay, as arterial sclerosis is a disease for which,\nunfortunately, there is no complete cure.\nAnd here it may be as well to state that I instructed\nthe detective to go to the Registrar of Deaths for the\ndistrict in which A. V. B. died, and ascertain whether\ninquiries had been made, by any person, as to the nature\nof A. V. B.\"s last illness. The detective was told that in\nthis case no inquiries had been made, and that even had\nthey been, under no circumstances would such questions\nbe answered at the office. Lady Troubridge visited the\nhotel where A. V. B. died ; she found that the former\nhall-porter had left, but she interviewed the proprietress,\nusing again the pretext that some hypothetical friend of\nA. V. B.'s might have come to inquire for her, and have\nasked for details regarding her last illness. The proprietress\nassured Lady Troubridge that she herself had received no\ninquiries, and that had any inquiries been made of the\nhall porter, or of any other employe of the hotel, the\nenquirers would at once have been referred to herself.\nNothing further of importance with regard to A. V. B.'s\na ppearance occurred till eight months later, when on\nJune 6th, 1917, a much more detailed description of her\nwas given by Feda. By this date, as we shall see later,\nA. V. B. had been trying her hand at a personal control 1\nof the medium, and during a personal control which\nhad occurred a short time prior to this sitting of\nJune 6th, 1917, A. V. B. complained that Feda always\ndescribed her as being too old looking. I did not\nthereupon begin to expatiate upon A. V. B.'s appearance\n1\nWe use the term \" personal control \" for convenience without making any\nassumption as to what actually occurs during this phenomenon.\n\flxxvtel] Communicator's Personal Appearance. 355\nwhen at her best ; I merely remarked that she had\nalways been a young-looking woman. As a matter of fact\nFeda's earlier descriptions, although not flattering, and\ninclined to pick out the weak points and ignore the\ngood, were on the whole good descriptions of A. V. B.\nas she was for a little time before her death. The des-\ncription which we will now quote is a very remarkable\none of A. V. B. as she was when she was younger. Here\nis the extract from the sitting of June 6th, 1917. Lady\nTroubridge took the sitting and I recorded.\nF. Mrs. Una, she's got a nice complexion, very nice,\nit isn't a bit wrinkled, it's very smooth. Before\nshe passed on her cheeks fell in a little bit, and\ndo you know her mouth had got drawn down a\nlittle in the left corner, like this 1 (Feda draws\ndown one side of her mouth a little) She's showing\nthat ; it was straight at the other corner, but\nthe left side is drawn down, and in a bit, but\nnot very much.\nM. R. H. Yes, that was so, but I'm not sure that you've\ngot the right side.\nF. Well, Feda thinks she shows the left side. It\ngives her face rather a drawn look. She used to\nhave a very pretty chin and neck, but the\nmuscles had got a little flabby and let it fall a\nbit, so that when you'd see her side-face, it didn't\nlook quite so stucked out and pretty as it used to.\nM. R. H. She's always making mistakes between the right\nand left.\nF. Yes, she explained that to you once. You see it's\nlike a negative to Feda, what she shows. You\nknow, Mrs. Una, how in a photo, if you've been\nwearing something on your right side, it comes\nout as though it were your left.\nU. V. T. Well, but the fact is perfectly right and it's a\nvery good evidential proof.\nF. It took away that pretty, chirpy look from her\nface. (Feda begins pouting out her lips.) Mrs.\nUna, when she had her under lip coming out\n\f356 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nlike this (Feda slightly pulls out her under-lip\nwith finger and thumb), it made her look cheeky-\nlooking. It stuck out a little firmly ; under the\nlip it was tucked in, in a little dip, and then it\ncame out in a pretty rounded chin ; Feda can\nsee all this because she's like that now, you know,\nbut when she first came here she was not so\npretty as she is now. You don't think she'll\nmind Feda saying that she has rather a cheeky\nmouth and chin do you ?\nU. V. T. No, of course not, it's a very good description.\nF. She says she doesn't know, perhaps she does look\ncheeky now. Her face has got pretty, soft curves,\nbut Feda feels that under that softness there\nwould be a little sharp determinedness ; Feda\nfeels it would be like looking awful softly at\npeople when they were off their guard, and that\nthen she would suddenly come out and put her\nfoot down and get her own way. They would\nbe so surprised, but while their mouths were still\nopen, she would have done it. She's got a lot\nof determination, but there's no fuss, no noise,\nshe didn't say much, but she managed it some-\nhow. Feda doesn't think that her nose and eyes\nwere so cheeky as her mouth and chin.\nU. V. T. Why ?\nF. Her nose is not turned up, it's straight, or nearly\nso, but it scoops in a little at the bridge, Feda\nsees ; it's not a nose that comes out at all at\nthe bridge ;\nyou see where the forehead starts\nit comes down straight, and there's no sharp\ndivision between the nose and the forehead, it's\nmore curved in, and a little flat at the bridge\npart, and then it comes out a little bit more at\nthe tip, but it's not a puggy nose ; she says :\n\" Certainly not.\" But look, Mrs. Una, it widens\nhere a little bit, (Feda touches her nostrils) the\nnostrils are wider than the tip ; she hasn't got\na wide tip to her nose at all, it's a pretty shape\nat the tip.\n\flxxviii.] Communicator's Personal Appearance. 357\nU. V*. T. You do see her clearly to-day, Feda.\nF. Yes, Feda feels that her nostrils used to move a\nbit too, but perhaps everybody's do a bit, but\nher's were sensitive ; from the nose to the upper\nlip is very pretty, it looks rather straight when\nit's seen sideways, but there's a little dip in it,\na groove ; it's not at all long though ; her upper\nlip doesn't look very full, but it's very prettily\ncurved, it's got a clean little curve, and going\nfrom the middle, the upper lip has a very pretty\nclean little curve. (Feda traces the mouth from\ncentre to corner along the top lip.) The lip\ndoesn't spread out at all over the side, her under\nlip is a little tiny bit bigger than the top lip,\nit shows more, because, when she turns sideways,\nsome people might say it was almost too much,\nbecause the under lip protruded a tiny bit beyond\nthe top lip. You would notice that sometimes,\nwhen people were talking to her, or she was\njust thinking.\nIT. V. T. Excellent !\nF. She doesn't mind a bit Feda saying that she's\ngot a cheeky face ; it's a rounded face with soft\ncurves, but you can see by the mouth and chin\nthat she was determined although she had a\nsoft face. Do you know what Feda means by\na moving face, an easy moving face ?\nU. V. T. Yes, you mean mobile.\nF. Yes, that's it. She wouldn't sit stiff-faced like\nmost people in this country do ; she wasn't stiff\nand frigid, she could move her eyes very quickly,\nbut not in a jumpy way, she had an easy way\nof moving them. She moved her lids very\nprettily ; she's got very prettily cut eyelids,\nespecially when they are closed. When she\ndrooped her eyes and looked down as she some-\ntimes did, when she stucked her mouth out, it\nwas very pretty. She sometimes did that you\nknow, stucked out her under-lip, and drooped\nher eyes and looked down (Feda gives an imita-\n\f358 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\ntion of this with the head held very well back)\nShe says she knew when she was doing that ,\nshe says she didn't always do it accidentally.\nU. V. T. Then why did she do it ?\nF. She says : \"It was just a little pose of mine.\"\nbut Feda can see that it isn't a way many\npeople have ;\nthey wouldn't have the ease of\nface to carry it out. She used to hold her neck\nup, but she always did that. Do you know her\nback was curved in a bit here ? (Feda touches\nher waist at the back.) She had a kind of\nhollow, she's laughing at that ; but though\nshe was hollow there, it didn't make her have\nbig shoulder blades ; it was just a natural\ncurve that she had in her body, just there.\nShe dipped in there, (Feda indicates her back\nagain.) Feda thinks that's very nice. When\nshe walked it was the same as when she was\nsitting, it was like this, (Feda holds her shoulders\nvery straight but easily), and then her back curved\nin, but she was straight from here downwards\n(indicates the line from bust to waist), it looks\nrather a straight line down the front, though she\nwas a bit full here, not too full, nicely (Feda\nindicates her bust). You can't help seeing that\nshe goes in at the waist because of the curve at\nthe back. When she walked she didn't jerk, she\ndidn't go like this, (here Feda moves her shoulders\nto indicate an uneven walk). She walked very\nsmoothly, it's a bit as if she were on rollers.\nDid she sometimes have her hair raised up here ?\n(Feda touches the front of her head.) Feda\n. means across here ; it doesn't seem as though\nshe wore it just straight back, it looks as if it\nhad been pulled forward ; she didn't drag it\nback, and she hasn't got it done low at the\nback, it was taken up. It stuck out on the\ncrown of her head, and she didn't wear it there\njust in one coil, it seems to Feda to be in\nseveral bits, and it was rather puffed out behind\n\flxxviii.] Communicator's Personal Appearance. 359\ntoo. It wasn't dragged up from the back of the\nears, it was worn more loosely.\nAs will have been noticed, this description of A. V. B.\nis broken into just at the beginning by the description\nof one side of the mouth, which is said to have been\ndrawn down a little before she died. A. V. B. is said\nto be showing that. Now this slight drawing down of\nthe mouth on one side was a consequence of A. V. B.'s\nstroke ; it was the only visible blemish caused by the\nstroke. Only those few people who were with her during\nher last illness can have seen this blemish, as it dis-\nappeared a short time after her death. Our impression\nhad been that this drawing down of the mouth was on\nthe right side, not the left, and we accordingly contra-\ndicted Feda on this point. It appears, however, that\nshe was right, and we were wrong ; for the paralysis\nwas right-sided and we now learn from our medical friends\nthat right-sided paralysis affecting the face would cause the\nmouth to be drawn down on the left side. Feda prefaces this\nlong description of A. V. B. by remarking that the muscles\nof the chin and neck had got a little flabby. This suggests\nearlier descriptions. The whole of the description which\nfollows on U. V. T.'s remark that Feda's reference to the\nmouth having been drawn down is correct, is very note-\nworthy indeed. There is not one detail which is wrong\nin the description, either of A. V. B.'s appearance,\nmannerisms or characteristics. There are one or two points,\nof course, which are pre-eminent in interest, and the first\nof these occurs when Feda gives us to understand that\nA. V. B. was in the habit of protruding her under-lip.\nAnd a little further on she slightly elaborates this statement\nby telling us that one would notice this peculiarity some-\ntimes when people were talking to A. V. B., or when she\nwas just thinking. A. V. B. had a habit of protruding\nher under-lip ; she often did it when people were talking\nto her, or, as Feda says, when she was thinking. The next\npoint of special interest we find contained in Feda's words :\n\" She's got very prettily cut eyelids, especially when they\nare closed.\"' A. V. B. was always said to have very\nperfectly modelled eyelids, especially when they were\n\f360 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [paet\nclosed ;\nthey were considered one of her best points. But\nwhen we come to Feda's description of what A. V. B.\nherself defines through Feda as \" just a little pose of\nmine \" it is still more interesting ; because what Feda\nhas described regarding the drooped eyelids, the pro-\ntruded hp, and the head well back, all of which A. V. B.\ngives us to understand she didn't always do accidentally,\nis an exact description of a characteristic attitude of\nA. V. B.'s ; a pose so familiar as to have become almost\nsecond nature. The next point of particular interest\noccurs when Feda describes the curve or hollow in A. V. B.'s\nback. This was a marked characteristic, and she often\ngrumbled about it, as it gave her backaches. If she\nwere ill in bed for any length of time, her unusually\narched back would cause her inconvenience, and pillows\nwould have to be arranged in order to support it.\nAlthough there are in existence sketches and portraits\nof A. V. B., two of which at least have been reproduced\nin print, none of these portraits or sketches show the\narch in the back.\nA. V. B.'s walk is also admirably described. We can\nonly add, regarding the whole of the description, in-\ncluding that of her manner of walking, that it is life-\nlike of A. V. B. as she was some years ago, and that the\npoints of particular interest which we have mentioned\nwould have been just the points which A. V. B. would\nhave endeavoured to get described, in order that there\nshould be no mistake as to her identity.\n\fLxxvni.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator 361\nCHAPTER II.\nEvidence of Memory retained by the Communicator.\nWe shall now leave descriptions of personal appearance\nand conditions, and treat of memory as a proof of identity.\nFrom the beginning proofs of persistent memory have\noccurred ;\nduring various sittings A. V. B. has given\nthrough Feda descriptions of articles, including certain\npieces of jewellery, which had been in her possession.\nAll these pieces of jewellery I have been able to identify\nwith the exception of one ; we will not, however, enumerate\nthem, because portions of A. V. B.'s Will appeared in\nthe newspapers, including a description of some of her\njewels.\nSection I. Memory of Riding and M. R. H.'s Horse.\nAnother point concerning which we think that A. V. B.\nhas demonstrated clear memory is my fondness for horses\nand riding. At the sitting of October 2nd, 1916, when,\nas has already been said, I took the sitting, Lady Trou-\nbridge recording, the following occurred :\nF. Feda sees a horse, how funny ! He's looking over\nher shoulder, he's a brown, sleek horse, she says\nshe's keeping it for when you come over.\nM. R. H. Describe it.\nF. Thin face, slender face, slim horse. Feda knows\nthe difference between this kind and the kind\nthat draws carts. He's got a very soft mouth.\nM. R. H. Is there any colour on his face ?\nF. There is some mark on his forehead ; the ears are\nnot very big, little ears, a beautiful shiny-looking\nface. He has large eyes, and a beautiful ex-\npression. The little ears give him a naughty,\n\f362 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nsmart look, but his eyes and mouth have a\nsweet, kind look. She seems to think you like\nhorses. She thinks you will be pleased.\nDuring the sitting of October 9th, 191G, at which I\nwas the sitter and Lady Troubridge the recorder, we\nobtained the following words :\nF. She says : \" Don't laugh, I've been learning to\nride.\" She means on a horse, she's watching\nif you laugh.\nM. R. H. I know she tried once when we were together.\nF. She says she thinks she's getting on very well.\nShe says are you sure you're not laughing ? She\nsays she doesn't really mind if you are. She\nsays she always thought she'd like to ride, and\nthat you will love it when you come. There are\nplenty of horses that love to be exercised, and\nthe ground is so springy.\nLater on in the same sitting Feda remarks :\n\" She\nsays :\n'\nYou wouldn't like to be without dogs and horses.'\n\"\nOn December 6th, 1916, when I was the sitter and\nLady Troubridge recorded, the sitting opened with another\nreference to the horse. It was as follows :\nF. Your Ladye's here, she's got that nice horse with\nher again. She's got her arm round his neck,\nshe seems to think he wouldn't bite, but she\nwants you to see that she's got her arm around\nhim. She seems a bit careful about it. It's\nthat horse with the funny mark between his eyes.\nHe's got a nice face, he moves his ears about\na lot\u2014jerks and twitches them. She seems glad\nshe's got horses, but Feda doesn't think it's for\nher own sake but for yours.\nAnd later in the same sitting Feda remarks :\nF. She says horses must be kept for you, but not so\nmuch for her, but she says her riding has im-\nproved. She says, \" I wasn't a success on the\nearth plane with riding,\" but she's keeping the\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator 363\nhorses ready for you, and she says there are no\noverworked or badly treated horses over there.\nOn January 3rd, 1917, upon which day I was sitting\nand Lady Troubridge was recording, the following was\ngiven :\nF. She's so glad there are animals in the spirit world,\nshe's not really afraid of horses, and she knows\nnow that they can't hurt her, but when she\nfirst passed over she was still a bit wary of\nthem.\nIn the first extract I recognised in the description\ngiven by Feda a favourite hunter of mine who had been\nshot some years prior to A. V. B.'s death, and who had\nbeen well-known to her. This particular hunter is the\nonly horse I have ever had destroyed, or who has died,\nwhile in my possession. The \" little ears \" upon which\nFeda remarks were a marked characteristic of this horse.\nThroughout these extracts we appear to find A. V. B.\nclearly remembering my love of horses, animals in which\nshe personally took no particular interest. When A. V. B.\nfirst knew me intimately, I hunted a great deal, and from\nthe fact that she is said to think that I shall be glad\nthat she is keeping for me the particular horse described,\nwe may perhaps conclude that she remembers that I was\ngreatly attached to him.\nWith regard to A. V. B.'s saying through Feda on\nOctober 9th, 1916, that she has been learning to ride,\nand watching at the same time to see if I should laugh\nat her, we do not propose to offer any opinion upon\nrather startling statements of this kind regarding con-\nditions after death. In the present state of our know-\nledge they cannot be evidential. We propose to treat\nthis particular statement only from the standpoint of\nits value as demonstrating persistence of memory. As a\nyoung bride in India A. V. B. had ridden, not very well\nI believe ; but on one occasion, many years later, when\nwe were living together, she suddenly took it into her\nhead that she wanted to ride again. She had not been\non a horse since she left India, as far as I know ; never-\n\f364 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\ntheless she went to a riding school and got as far as\nhaving an expensive habit made. We were going abroad\nat the time to a place where A. V. B. thought that\nriding would be useful. Now I made fun of this riding\nepisode, and teased her a great deal, especially as\nwe did not go to the place intended and the new\nhabit was never worn. In this connection, as will\nhave been noticed, we may again infer from Feda's\nwords that it is I who love horses, and will avail myself\nof them in my next state of existence. There also\nappears to be a memory shown here of my love of\ndogs. During her lifetime, A. V. B., who was not herself\nvery fond of dogs in general, suffered patiently a succession\nof my pets.\nIn the extract from the sitting of December 6th, 1916,\nFeda tells me that A. V. B. has got her arm round the\nhorse's neck, and that she, A. V. B., wishes me to\nnotice this ; Feda adds that A. V. B. \" seems a bit\ncareful about it.\" Later in that same sitting we find\nA. V. B. again returning to the topic of riding, and\ndefinitely stating that horses must be kept for me and\nnot so much for her, admitting with candour that her\nriding during her earth life was not a success.\nAgain, in the extract from the sitting of January 3rd,\n1917, we are told that A. V. B. is not really afraid of\nhorses, as she knows now that they cannot hurt her, but\nthat she .was still wary of them when she first passed\nover.\nAll these statements are characteristic from several\nstandpoints.\nIt is superfluous to comment upon the reiteration of\nthe fact that it is my affection for horses that is to be\ngratified. As has already been said, A. V. B., during\nher lifetime was no horsewoman, she was very frightened\nof horses, and if it should be true that in her present\nstate of existence she has overcome this nervousness, she\nwould certainly wish to call my attention to the fact,\nas she apparently tries to do by intimating that she\nwishes me to notice that her arm is around my horse's\nneck.\n\flxxvhi.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 365\nIn the second extract from the sitting of December 6th,\n1916, there is an implication of the memory of another\naspect of my love for horses. A. V. B. assures me\nthrough Feda that there are no over-worked or badly\ntreated horses in the spirit world. It would appear that\nshe has not forgotten the many times during our long\nfriendship when I was greatly angered and distressed by\nthe sight of an over-worked or ill-used horse.\nSection II. Memory of Characteristics of M. R. H.\nWe now come to another point upon which A. V. B.\nappears to have retained her memory. During the sitting\nof October 2nd, 1916, which I took, Lady Troubridge\nacting as recorder, the foUowing occurred :\nM. R. H. Does she know I am going away ?\nF. Yes, she seems anxious about it. It isn't what\nyou're going to do there.\nM. R. H. Tell her Una will look after me.\nF. She says, yes, she is very glad if she will ; that\nis, if you will let her ; she says she has got a\nvery difficult task.\nThe sitting of October 13th, 1916, which was taken by\nLady Troubridge and recorded by me, terminated with\nthe following :\nU. V. T. Tell Ladye she's got to help me to take care of\nTwoimie.1\nF. She says, yes, she wants that, she puts her in\nyour charge.\nU. V. T. Tell her I will do my best.\nF. She says she's afraid you hardly appreciate the\nmagnitude of your task. It will be perfectly\nawful sometimes, terrible !\nNow this would appear to show a memory of one of\nmy tiresome characteristics. With reference to Lady Trou-\nbridge's looking after me, it might have been gathered\n1\nLady Troubridge at the time of this sitting always employed Feda's\nversion of my nickname when speaking of me in Feda's hearing, as the said\nnickname was not pronounced correctly by Feda until a later date.\n\f366 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nthat I liked being looked after, since I myself suggested\nthat it should be so ; whereas it would seem that A. V. B\nremembers that when I am not well I do not like being\nfussed over, and that I become stubborn and irritable.\nSection III. Memory of Places where the Communicator and\nM. R. H. have been together. (A) Malvern Wells.\nA. V. B. has also shown evidence of memory on many\noccasions regarding places which she and I visited to-\ngether. Space forbids that we should record all the\ninstances, and we will only discuss a few of them. But\neven so, it is, we fear, inevitable that descriptions of\nplaces unknown to the reader, and the necessary comments\non them, should seem long and tedious, and be difficult\nto follow. We recommend the omission of at any rate\nthose relating to Malvern Wells on a first reading, although\nthey are, we think, important for students of these\nphenomena.\nOn October 9th, 1916, at a sitting which I took, Lady\nTroubridge acting as recorder, A. V. B. alluded to a fall\non to her knees which she had once had, and that allusion\nled up to the following description of a house.\nF. There is a little vestibule with a door to right\nand left, you pass these doors and the hall goes\non, broken into by a staircase. She thinks you\nwere with her. The hall goes on beyond, and\ngrows darker, but there is light coming down\nthe stairs, as if from a skylight or something.\nFeda sees something hanging at the side of the\nstaircase like pictures. The staircase goes up a\nlittle and then a space and then up. Feda thinks\nthere is a way to go up to another floor but\nby a different staircase. Feda sees something at\nthe top of the staircase, it looks like a big box\nor chest, not exactly a seat, but it looks as if\nyou could sit on it if you wanted to ; it's wood,\ncarved, not plain ;\nit's got fat legs, it can't be\na chest quite ; it's not the same side as the\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 367\nstairs, more like the other side of the stairs on\nthe landing.\nM. R. H. I don't place that.\nF. Can you make inquiries, it would be an awful\ngood test ?\nM. R. H. There was nothing like that on the landing in my\ntime. If it's the house I think it is, I don't\nsee where they could put it.\nF. Well, she shows it for some purpose ; could it be\nthat it's there now ?\nU. V. T. That would be a good test.\nF. Feda thinks she means now, she seems anxious it\nshould be cleared up. There doesn't seem a\nlot of room, perhaps she's just been there and\nseen it, so you must ask.\nM. R. H. I will write.\nF. Now Feda thinks she's making fun, you couldn't\nstand on the roof there, could you ?\nM. R. H. No.\nF. She says there's a reason why one might want to\nstand on the roof. She doesn't mean that you\nwalk about it, but someone had to get on the\nroof for a purpose, and they didn't use a ladder.\nM. R. H. I can't understand.\nF. She gets impatient ; it doesn't look to Feda like a\nhouse you could stand on the roof, it's an ordi-\nnary roof. It had to be mended, Feda thinks,\nno one conld have walked on the roof, they\nwould have fallen off. Feda is right, she gives\nin that much ; Feda can only sense what she\nmeans. She's awfully pleased, she's laughing.\nIn this description there are several mistakes, and yet,\ntaken in conjunction with the fall which is mentioned\njust before it begins, it is pretty clear that The White\nCottage, Malvern Wells, is meant ; the house which we\nreferred to at the beginning of this paper as having been\nmuch loved by A. V. B. and myself. A. V. B. had a\nfall on to her knees at the house in question. In this\nhouse of mine there was a little vestibule with a door\n\f368 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nto right and left ;\npassing those doors as you entered\nthe house, the hall ran on, broken into by a staircase,\nand towards the end of this hall, or little vestibule, it\ngrew darker. Light came down the staircase as Feda\nsays ; she does not get quite clearly why this was. It\nwas not from a skylight, it was from the panes of a\ndoor on the first landing, which, facing the staircase,\nled out on to a back road. All the way up the stairs\nwere small pictures, but at this point Feda makes a\nmistake, because the stairs ran up in one straight flight\nand had no half-landing. Feda is correct, however, when\nshe says that there is a way to go up to another floor,\nbut by a different staircase. Two of the servants' bed-\nrooms in this house were approached by a little enclosed\nstaircase which led up from the first landing, and which\nhad no connection whatever with the main stairs\nor the back staircase. This little staircase could not\nbe seen from the front hall or from the landing, you only\ndiscovered it when you were actually in front of it.\nFeda is entirely wrong regarding a big box or chest.\nI wrote to the lady who purchased our house, and she\nassured me that nothing of the kind had ever been on\nthe landing. With regard to the reference to the roof,\nabout which A. V. B. appears to be making fun, the\namount of repairing required by this house had become\na standing joke ; there was always something going wrong\nwith some part of the house or another, including the\nroof ; so much so, that I once wrote a skit about it for\nA. V. B.'s amusement. I do not, however, understand\nthe reference to someone getting on to the roof without\na ladder ; as far as I can remember the workmen always\nused a ladder. At the same time the roof at the back\nsloped down very much, coming close to a fairly low\nwall, and might, I should say, have been accessible with-\nout a ladder ; one part of the roof could also be reached\nfrom an upper window. This is the first description of\nThe White Cottage ever attempted by A. V. B. through\nFeda ; other and more evidential descriptions of the house\nand the neighbourhood occurred later on. Here is one\nof them.\n\fLxxvm.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 369\nOn October 18th, 1916, at a sitting which I took, Lady\nTroubridge recording, we got a description of some\ngarden and green-house flowers, which we omit because,\nalthough correct, it was not very interesting. This des-\ncription of flowers, however, led on to the following :\nF. She's taking Feda inside the house and upstairs.\nIt's a straggly house, when you've got upstairs\nand want to get to a certain room you have to\ngo up more stairs. Feda thinks there's no need\nfor them ! She says there are two staircases with\na long passage in between them. She says there's\na Persian rug in a room, a large one with a\nvery light ground, it's on something rather browny\n\u2014a brown floor cover. Down the passage, half-\nway up the walls it is dark, then there's a\nlittle ledge and it goes lighter to the top. In a\nway the garden is rather a funny shape, it's in\nthree distinct parts and yet they all run into\none another.\nM. R. H. Yes, that's right.\nF. But there's something at one side, cuts them up\nrather.\nM. R. H. What ?\nF. It looks like a kind of outbuilding, it's not water.\nFeda sees very indistinctly something built out.\nYou can get right round the house and get in\nat the other side. You can get in three ways ;\ntwo often used, but one not so much. From\nthe front she takes Feda round ; it's a funny\nshape, it goes in and comes out again. You can\ngo in and get out at another place too.\nM. R. H. Right. There are three entrances if it's the house\nI mean.\nF. She thinks most of the one at the front and the\none you go right round to. She's most interested\nin that back one. She's smiling. She's talking\nabout a room, nothing to do with the house at\nall, cut off from it ; it's a properly furnished\nroom, a comfy room, you could sit in.\n\f370 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nM. R. H. Right.\nF. There's something wicker in it.\nM. R. H. Quite right.\nF. There's something hanging on the wall, not a\npicture, but something in colours\u2014Feda can't\nquite see, it looks like a little curtain not very\nlow down. It hangs in folds carelessly, it was\nsomething used sometimes, but not always. People\nused to come in and put it there.\nM. R. H I can't quite place that.\nF. Also in a corner it looks as though someone had\nleft an umbrella and a stick. There is a table\ntoo, with a book on it. What is she saying ?\nShe says something about \" guilty of having\ntea there.\" Feda doesn't know, it looks as though\nsomeone had carried a tray there as though for tea.\nM. R. H. Yes, that's all right ; but I don't understand what\nshe means by \" guilty.\"\nF. \"Guilty\" must have got through wrong, Feda\nexpects.\nM. R. H. Ask her, does she remember that the place she\nspeaks of has been sold ?\nF. She didn't seem to remember until you said it.\nM. R. H. Does she remember it now ?\nF. She says she really hadn't thought of the place as\nhaving been sold or not, only as a test.\nM. R. H. It's a good test.\nF. Was it right about the tea-tray ?\nM. R. H. Quite right.\nF. Is there a square window in that room, not a\nlong-shaped one ?\nM. R. H. Well, yes.\nF. Were there, do you remember, some pinky-coloured\ncushions that were taken there, plain cushions ?\nM. R. H. Yes, there were.\nF. She says it used to be damp in there, and things\ncouldn't be left there\u2014it was nice and dry in\nwarm weather, but not at other times. There\nwas a nasty smell once, after its being closed\nup, which worried her.\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 371\nM. R. H. I can't remember the smell.\nF. Feda doesn't think she's right, but she says some-\nthing about clothes being left in there.\nM. R. H. She is partially right.\nF. It doesn't feel like a place for clothes\u2014there's\nanother place just near it with tools in. She's\nshowing Feda a thing with a long handle and a\nround thing on it.\nM. R. H. Right.\nF. There are all kinds of iron things in there. Feda\nhears them clankety. She says a tree came down.\nM. R. H. That's right.\nF. After some delay it was cut up.\nM. R. H. I don't place the cutting up.\nF. Not at the time, it wasn't.\nM. R. H. Yes, I can place that, I think, perhaps.\nF. Pieces were taken off it purposely.\nM. R. H. Perhaps.\nF. She's thinking of a storm, a very windy time\nthere. You remember a road runs across the\nfront of the house, and another runs down the side\nmaking a right angle ;\nyou couldn't see the road\nwhen you were standing in the garden.\nM. R, H. Quite right.\nF. But sometimes you can hear noises on it.\nM. R. H. Do you mean this side road has something to do\nwith the garden ?\nF. Yes, it's soft and gravelly, Avith a border running\ndown it. It's not a wide road.\nM. R. H. Right.\nF. She says now something about a church not far\naway.\nM. R, H. That's correct.\nK. Lf you walk a little further along the road that\nruns past the house, you can see steam from a\nsteam engine.\nM. R. H. Correct.\nF. As you're standing by the side of the house,\nlooking there (Feda points out beyond), you'll\nsee the ground rises right up sharply.\n2 a\n\f372 Miss Baddyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nM. R. H. Quite right.\nF. She says she's clever.\nM. R, H. You both are.\nF. Yes, she is, Feda can't get it if she can't ; she\nsays she loved that place, and loves to think\nof it,\nM. R. H. So do I.\nF. She says :\n\" Happy times.\" She says you could\ngo to one, two, or three parts of that house,\nand think each was separate, but Feda thinks\nthat's not quite right. It's a very funny shaped\nhouse ;\nyou know when you get to the top of\nthose stairs, you can turn one way or the other,\nif you go to the right you go through a narrow\npart and come to a broader part\u2014a landing.\nM. R. H. Yes.\nF. She says that from the floor, that is the ground\nfloor, you can go down again, she says right\ninside the house there are stairs going down\nagain. She says there are rooms downstairs\nunderneath the back of the house, back of the\nhouse the rooms are\u2014it makes another floor,\nyou used to keep things down there.\nM. R. H. Cellars ?\nF. No, not coals, far more important things ; it makes\nan extra floor. You or she wouldn't like to live\nthere, but one could live there.\nM. R. H. Feda, I am addled !\nF. Can't Mrs. Una remember ?\nU. V. T. No.\nF. Under the ground floor there are other rooms.\nunderneath the floor the dining-room's on.\nM. R. H. I can't remember, she must have made a mistake.\nF. She says, \" No, no,\" you can get right into them from\nthe back of the house, but they're not visible\nfrom the front. You know when she's positive,\nshe's awful positive about things.\nM. R. H. Yes. I know.\nF. She doesn't want you to forget that point, and she\nwants you to tell her if you remember. You\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 373\nknow the part that sticks out from the house-\nit looks to Feda not so high as the house, a\nbit lower. Now, it's difficult to explain, but\nwhen you look towards where the ground slopes\nup, the view is cut by something that looks\nlight, almost like a line ; Feda doesn't know if\neveryone would notice it that way, but it cuts\nthe view. There's a very old building in a bad\nstate of repair, some of the windows are out, it's\ndark grey stone, it's not far from the house ;\nFeda doesn\"t think you can see it from the house\nbut you get to it very easily ; it's very old and\ndark. It's been there not fifty or a hundred,\nbut several hundred years.\nYes.\nFeda doesnt know why she's interested in telegraph\npoles and wires. Oh ! you know the road that\nruns across the front of the house, if you go\nfurther up that road, on the left side there's\na clump of trees.\nWe are of opinion that the above description undoubtedly\nrefers to the same house of which a very slight description\nwas received on October 9th, 1916. This house, The\nWhite Cottage, Malvern Wells, was as Feda says, a\nstraggly one. It had once been an old inn, with a cider\nhouse standing beside it, the two being probably connected ;\nthe inn and the cider house had later been turned into\na dwelling-house. At least local tradition says so. If\nyou entered this house by the front door and went\nupstairs, and you wished to reach the second floor, you\nhad to ascend the little enclosed staircase which we have\nalluded to in our remarks upon the description given\non October 9th, 1916. We do not know why Feda gives\nit as her opinion that there is no need for this small\nstaircase, as without it the rooms could not have been\nreached. She is correct when she speaks of there being\ntwo staircases with a long passage in between them ;\nwhat had originally been the inn possessed one staircase,\nand what had originally been the cider house possessed\nM. R. H.\nF.\n\f374 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nanother. There was a bathroom connecting the two wings\nof the house, which, when not in use, was the common way of\napproach between one staircase and another. This bath-\nroom had presumably at one time been a passage, it\nalways gave me that impression. In my dressing-room\nI had a Persian rug, at least I think it was Persian, at\nall events it was Oriental. It had a dark blue design\non a white ground, and the floor on which this rug was\nlaid was covered with brown linoleum. As to the size\nof the rug I should say it would have been better to\ndescribe it as fairly large. A. V. B. was particularly\nfond of this rug, begging me not to sell it when we\nbroke up the house shortly before her death ; we had\nquite a long discussion on the subject. Feda makes a\ncurious mistake when she says that the walls of the\npassage are dark, and that then there is a little ledge\nwith light colour above it. All the walls of the passages\nof this house were distempered in cream, but, curiously\nenough, A. V. B. and I had many times discussed the\nadvisability of panelling the hall, stairs and passages with\noak, which was to have ended about half way up in\na ledge.\nThe garden of our house was rather an unusual shape ;\nit was more or less on the side of a hill, and in three\ndistinct parts. I should have divided it myself as follows :\none part of the garden consisting of two lawns in front\nof the house ; another part of the garden consisting of\na wide herbaceous border, etc., completely hidden from\nthe first part mentioned by a tall hedge and trees ;\nand yet another part lying below the lawns, which\nwas totally different from the rest of the garden. Feda's\nalhision to something which seems to cut the garden up,\nsomething built out which she cannot see distinctly,\nprobably refers to a cottage which stood in the garden\na very short distance from, and on the same level as,\nthe house. We shall have to refer to this cottage later on.\nAnd now we come to a rather interesting point. Feda\nsays that you can go round the house and get in at the\nother side. She says that the house has three entrances,\ntwo of which are often used, but one not so much, and\n\fLxxvm.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 375\ngoes on to say that A. V. B. is taking her round the\nhouse from the front, presumably we may suppose for\nsome special reason ; and she further says that you can\nget in at one part of the house and get out at another\nplace, and that A. V. B. thinks most of the entrance\nat the front and the entrance you have to go right\nround the house to get to, and that A. V. B. is most\nof all interested in the back entrance.\nThe house in question was on the side of a hill. It\nhad, in addition to the tradesmen's entrance, two principal\nentrances, one at the back and one at the front ; the front\ndoor was on a lower level than the back door, but was\nreached by a steep path up the garden. The other door\nwas directly opposite the front door, but was at the top\nof the stairs on the first floor. This last door was ap-\nproached from outside by a comfortable road ; it was on\na level with that road, and if you entered the house from\nthat side you entered it directly on the bedroom floor\n\u2014\nin fact, one may say, that the hind legs of the house\nwere shorter than its forelegs. A. V. B. particularly\ndisliked hills, she also disliked stairs, her heart being\nrather delicate ;\nit was therefore her invariable habit to\nuse this back entrance in preference to the front one ;\nour motor was always stopped at this back entrance,\nand, when walking, she preferred the gentle incline which\nled up to the road running past this back door, rather\nthan the steep incline which led up through the garden\nto the front door. This back entrance to the cottage\nwas often remarked on by A. V. B. as being, for her,\none of its principal attractions, and she was very fond\nof leaving this door open in the summer, by doing which\none obtained a beautiful view of the hill beyond. As\nI have already said, in addition to the two entrances\ndescribed there was a tradesmen's entrance, making, as\nFeda states, three entrances in all.\nShortly after this description of the entrances, Feda\nsays that A. V. B. is talking about a room : a room that\nhas nothing to do with the house at all, that is cut off\nfrom it, and yet that is properly furnished ; in fact, a\ncomfortable room that you could sit in. She speaks of\n\f376 Miss Badclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nsomething wicker in this room, of pinky-coloured, plain\ncushions, and also of a tea-tray having been carried out\nthere. Now in the cottage to which we have already\nreferred as standing beside the house, there were two\ncommunicating rooms, used by the servants, one as a\ndouble bedroom and one as a servants' hall. This cottage\nwas only a stone's throw away from the house, and our\nservants were in the habit of having their tea there.\nIn this connection the word \" guilty \"'\nis not understood\nby us, though I am bound to say that A. V. B. and I\noccasionally deplored the noise our servants made at\nteatime when we were in the garden. I think it must\nbe admitted that it is not very usual to have a well-\nfurnished room which is used as a servants' hall in a\nseparate building detached from the house. There were\nwicker chairs in this servants' hall, and, of course, a table.\nI cannot remember any coloured thing, like a curtain\nhanging on the wall such as Feda speaks of, a thing that\npeople used to put there\u2014it may have been a cloth or\nduster left there by the servants. The window of this\nservants' hall was practically square, and as Feda states\nthere were plain pink cushions in that room.\nNow, one of the great drawbacks to that annexe was\nthe damp ; as Feda says, it was dry in warm weather,\nbut not at other times. A. V. B. knew this well\nenough ; we received heavy gas bills for keeping a\nconstant gas-fire in the annexe throughout the winter or\nduring wet weather. On one occasion both the servants'\nhall and its communicating bedroom were not used for\nsome little time. A. V. B. was present when the rooms\nwere opened up, but I cannot remember that she remarked\non their smelling nasty, though they probably did so.\nA. V. B. speaks of clothes having been left in that room,\nand, in spite of Feda's demur, she is right. Some\nmonths prior to A. V. B.'s death we let the house\nfurnished, reserving for ourselves these two outside rooms,\nand A. V. B. stored a quantity of clothes in the servants'\nbedroom. The last time that A. V. B. ever saw our\nhouse at Malvern Wells was when she went there on a\nvisit, solely for the purpose of collecting and packing\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 377\nthese clothes. We put our trunks in the servants' hall,\nand removed the clothes from the servants' bedroom,\nstrewing them all over the servants* hall, where they\nremained for several days during the process of packing.\nIt must be clearly understood that these rooms were, in\na way, more like one room than two, inasmuch as the\nbedroom where the clothes were stored had no separate\nentrance, and had to be approached through the servants'\nhall.\nAt the end of the garden path, which led from the door\nof this servants' hall, there was a tool shed, which\nA. V. B. and I had erected principally for the accommo-\ndation of my particular gardening tools. With regard to\nthe tree said to have come down, this reference may\nrefer to one of two trees ;\neither to a favourite tree of\nA. V. B.'s which died, and had to be cut down,\nowing to the strong winds which made it a danger ; \u2014this\ntree I have since remembered I did. gradually have cut\nup for firewood :\n\u2014or it may refer to an accident which\nA. V. B. heard of shortly before her death. She was\nherself at The White Cottage when her favourite tree\nwas cut down, but was in London when she heard of\nthe accident. A builder who had worked for us for some\nyears was killed by a falling tree during a great storm at\nMalvern Wells. This accident particularly impressed itself\nupon A. V. B., the more so because she though c at first\nthat this man had been killed by a tree in he]' own\ngarden. We afterwards discovered that this was not the\ncase.\nRegarding the roads, one of which is said to run across\nthe front of the house and the other at a right angle,\nthere is a road running in front of the house at the foot\nof the garden. There is no road running at right angles\nto the house, at \u00bb,least none very near, but there is a\ngarden path. We think, however, that I gave Feda a\nclue regarding this right-angle road, which she afterwards\nturned into a path. It appears to us that my words\nmay have done so. This right- angle path, if it were\nreally meant, was completely hidden from the front garden,\nand had a border down one side of it.\n\f378 Miss Badclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nThe church which A. V. B. attended was not far from\nthe house ; and after this reference to a church we get\nan extremely good remark from Feda. who says that if\nyou walk a little further on along the road that runs\npast the house you can see steam from a steam\nengine. Now a little further on along the road which\nFeda describes, is a large stone-quarry which employs\ntraction-engines. These traction-engines had become a\nveritable curse to the neighbourhood. There was always\na traction-engine steaming at the quarry, and a few steps\nbeyond the quarry again, on the same road, was a little\nyard where these engines were kept. There were nearly\nalways one or two of them steaming in the yard as well.\nNo one deplored the eyesore of these traction-engines and\ntheir noise more than did A. V. B. On one occasion they\ncut up the back road used by our motor, and A. V. B.\nwas not unnaturally annoyed. Feda is quite correct in\nsaying that standing by the house and looking out you\nwould see the ground rise sharply. Supposing you were\nstanding by the back door, or to the side of the house, you\nwould see. across the road, the hill rising sharply up ; it was\nA. V. B.'s favourite view. And just here in the sitting\nwe get a little personal touch, which, in view of the\ndetective's report, is of interest. A. V. B. says that she\nloved the place, that she loves to think of it, and she\nspeaks of happy times.\nNow, while making inquiries in Malvern Wells and the\nneighbourhood, the detective employed by me ascertained\nthat there was an almost universal impression current to\nthe effect that A. V. B. disliked The White Cottage,\nMalvern Wells, and the neighbourhood thereof intensely.\nMy detective was told by several people that it was\nentirely A. V. B.'s fault that the house had been sold ;\nthat I should have been contented to remain there had\nit not been for her influence ; and indeed he found that\nthere existed quite a prejudice in the neighbourhood\nagainst A. V. B. on this score. But in reality, as A. V. B.\nstated clearly through Feda during the sitting we are\ndiscussing, she loved The White Cottage and all the\nsurrounding country. She felt deeply the necessity of\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 379\nhaving to sell the house owing to the war. Lady Trou-\nbridge was staying at the same hotel as A. V. B. while\nI was away making the final arrangements for selling\nThe White Cottage, and she assures me that A. V. B.\nfretted very much, and spoke to her constantly of the\ndeep regret which she felt at severing her connection\nwith Malvern Wells. In going over A. V. B.'s papers\nafter she died, I found that she had kept a letter from me\nwhich I had written during my last visit to our house.\nShe had apparently felt so much sentiment about this\nhouse that a note had been pencilled by her on the\nenvelope of this letter, to the effect that I had written\nit from The White Cottage at a time when we were\nabout to give it up.\nWe cannot but feel that an excellent proof of Mrs.\nLeonard's honesty is afforded by this diversity between\nthe opinion held in the neighbourhood and A. V. B.'s\nreal sentiments, since it appears that had anybody been\ninquiring \u2022\nregarding A. V. B. and myself among the local\npeople, he would have received information on this point\nentirely contrary to that which we received through Feda.\nWe now come to that part of the extract in which\nFeda returns to the description of the inside of the house.\nFeda states that A. V. B. says there were one, two,\nthree parts of the house, and that you would think each\npart was separate, but she goes on to say that she does\nnot think that A. V. B. is quite right. In our opinion\nthere were decidedly two parts of that house, each of\nwhich you would think was separate if you did not know\nthe house well. This was certainly the impression left\non Lady Troubridge during the two visits she paid to The\nWhite Cottage. We have already said that at one time\nthe house had consisted of an inn and a cider house\n;\nas Feda says, it was a very funnily shaped house. With\nregard to the third part of the house, A. V. B. may have\nbeen thinking of the upper servants\" rooms which, as has\nalready been stated, were approached by a staircase which\nwas so far from being obvious that Lady Troubridge did\nnot discover its existence until she had stayed with me\nfor two days. Or A. V. B. may have been thinking of\n\f380 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nthe outside cottage, which, it will be remembered, con-\ntained a servants' hall and a double servants' bedroom,\nand which, although not attached to the house, was only\na few steps away. Both these suppositions are possibly\na little far-fetched however, so we do not press them ;\nwe will merely say that the statement is correct with\nregard to two parts of the house. Feda is again practi-\ncally right when she says that having reached the top\nof the stairs you can turn one way or the other, and\nthat if you go to the right you go through a narrow\npart, and come to a broader p landing.\nIf you turned sharply to the left, having mounted to\nthe top of the principal stairs, you came to some of\nthe bedrooms ; if you turned sharply to the right you\nwould go through the bathroom, previously alluded to,\nentering it by one door and leaving it by another door\ndirectly opposite, and would find yourself on a landing\nin a totally different part of the house ; the part of the\nhouse in fact which had at one time been a cider house.\nThis bathroom was a narrow apartment. I do not, how-\never, consider that the landing upon which you came out\nwas broader than the bathroom. To the best of my\nrecollection it was narrower, unless you included the\nstaircase that led down from this landing, in which case,\nshould you measure from the landing window straight\nacross the stairs to the wall on the far side, the space\nmight be wider than that occupied by the bathroom.\nWe now come to a definite mistake, and it is inter-\nesting to notice with what tenacity A. V. B., or perhaps\nFeda, clings to this wrong assertion, in spite of the fact\nthat we both of us contradict it. We may possibly be\nentitled to assume from this that Mrs. Leonard is not\nvery suggestible when in trance. We refer to Feda's\nstatement regarding the basement rooms.\nAs will have been gathered from our remarks during\nthat part of the sitting, there were no basement rooms\nat The White Cottage. But Feda sticks to the assertion\nthat there were such rooms, which could be entered\nfrom the back of the house. We will refer again later\nto these basement rooms. We wish first to deal with\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 381\nthe few other details of description given by Feda in the\npresent sitting. Feda speaks of a part which sticks out\nfrom the house, and which does not appear to be so high\nas the house. This may quite well be taken to refer to\na bow-window recently added to one side of the house\n;\nthis window had a roof which gave it the appearance\nfrom outside of being in keeping with the general archi-\ntecture of the building. Feda next speaks of something\nwhich cuts the view as you look out towards where the\nground slopes up. She says that it is light in appearance,\nalmost like a line, but appears to think that it is probable\nthat she has only caught a fleeting impression of this\nthing, since she says :\n\" Feda does not know if everyone\nwould notice it that way, but it cuts the view.\"\nNow I cannot think to what this refers, unless we\ngive Feda the benefit of supposing that she was not\nseeing the picture very clearly at the moment ; in which\ncase I should say without the slightest hesitation that\nA. V. B. was harking back, for the sake of evidence, to\nan old grievance. A. V. B. was particularly fond, as I\nhave already said, of a bit of wild hillside at the back\nof the house. She opposed every effort on my part to\nbring this land under cultivation, and was very much\nannoyed when I finally built a long green-house on the\nspot. This green-house was painted white, and straight\nalong the top of it ran the usual narrow beam of the\nroof. I remember well that we returned home one day\nto find that this green-house had been completed during\nour absence, and that A. V. B. exclaimed with great\nregret that the hillside was entirely ruined, and that the\nwhite line running along the top of my green-house was\npainfully obvious ; in fact, that I had cut her view. I\nmust admit that I myself was somewhat appalled at the\nhideous effect which I had produced, and as soon as\npossible had all the woodwork painted green, hoping that\nthereby it would blend into the hillside. A. V. B., how-\never, never ceased to deplore the effect of this green-\nhouse.\nThe very old building said by Feda to be built of\ndark grey stone, to be in a bad state of repair with\n\f382 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nsome of the windows out, and, although you could\nnot see it from the house, to be easily accessible,\nappears to me to refer to Little Malvern Church and its\nruined cloister ; this church and ruins stand actually in\nthe garden of Little Malvern Court. These ruins, as Feda\nsays, are of dark grey stone, and are several hundred\nyears old. They were well known to A. V. B. during\nher lifetime, as she had, on several occasions, seen and\nadmired them when visiting Little Malvern Court. After\nthis reference to the ruins, Feda says suddenly :\n\" Feda\ndoesn't know why she is interested in telegraph poles\nand wires.\" Now not so very long before A. V. B.\ndied we were both much distressed at finding that during\nour absence from The White Cottage, some fine old thorn\ntrees on the back road had been cut down. We enquired\nrather indignantly why this had been done, and were\ntold that the telegraph company had ordered it. They\nhad said that, as their poles ran along the bank, the\nbranches of the trees in question interfered with their\nwires. We took a great deal of trouble to investigate\nthis matter ; I remember that we drove some distance in\norder to interview the agent of the estate upon which\nthe trees had been cut down. These details are only\nmentioned in order to show that it would not be far-\nfetched to suppose that A. V. B. would remember tele-\ngraph poles and wires in connection with The White\nCottage.\nFeda is quite correct in saying that if you went along\nthe road that runs past the house you would come to\na clump of trees on the left. I am taking it for granted\nthat she is taking me along that road in the same\ndirection as she did when she mentioned the steam-\nengine. As a matter of fact you would also come to a\nclump of trees if you turned in the other direction, but\nI do not think that they are the trees meant, because,\nsupposing yourself to be going in the direction of the\nsteam-engine, you would come upon a clump of trees on\nyour left, which you would have to pass to reach British\nCamp, a favourite walk of A. V. B.'s ;\nyou would also\nhave to pass close to them to reach Little Malvern Court,\n\f1\nLxxvni.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 383\nnear which was the very old building described shortly\nbefore the mention of the trees.\nDuring the description of the inside of the house in\nthis sitting of October 18th, 1916, Feda mentioned some-\nthing that sounded like a bell-indicator. This she said\nwas in an oblong room, towards the back of the house,\non the ground floor. We omit this description for the\nsake of brevity. There was an oblong room at the back\nof the house on the ground floor, namely, the pantry,\nand there may or may not have been a bell-indicator\nthere. I do not think there was, though we had electric\nbells. However, the point is a trifling one.\nWe now return to the mis-statement made by Feda\nto the effect that the house contained basement rooms ;\nand we will give in detail what would appear to be the\ncorrection of this curious mistake. During the sitting\nof October 25th, 1916, which I took, Lady Troubridge\nbeing the recorder, the following occurred :\nM. R. H. Do you remember, Feda, that you described a house,\ntwo sittings ago ?\nF. Yes.\nM. R. H. She insisted on there being basement rooms in that\nhouse, and told me to tell her if I remembered,\nbut I know that there were no basement rooms,\nand by the description there is only one house\nshe can have meant. She must have got it\nthrough wrong.\nF. She still says that there are.\u2014not at the front but\nat the back.\nM. R. H. You know she said underneath the ground floor.\nF. She says, yes, it had rooms.\nM. R. H. Does she mean that you enter the house from the\nfront or the back ?\nF. You know as you come in at the front, you go\nstraight along, and she says the rooms are under\nthat.\nM. R. H. No. How many rooms does she say there are ?\nF. Two at the back. It's not like this house (meaning\nMrs. Leonard's flat). They are lower down than\n\f384 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nin this. She says you would find them if you\nexamined. Were there any cellars ?\nM. R. H. No ; but I may be mistaking the house, could\nshe show the first letter of the place were the\nhouse was ?\nF. Feda thinks she's got two houses in her mind, and\nis mixing them up. Feda remembers the house\nshe was so sure about. Feda thinks she's going\non to something else, she says she isn't. (To\nA. V. B.) Now try and tell Feda something more\nabout it. (To M. R. H.) Didn't she say last\ntime that the house was in a] westerly direction ?\nM. R. H. She didn't say so, but it's correct.\nHere ensued a little argument, as Lady Troubridge\nwhose geography was apparently shaky, interrupted to\nsay that she did not consider that the house was in a\nwesterly direction. Feda stuck tenaciously to her point\nhowever, and was found to have been correct.\nF. It is westerly, and she won't say there are not\ncellars.\nU. V. T. (to M. R. H.) Is it utterly impossible that there\nshould be rooms that were unknown to you ?\nM. R. H. She said I kept things there.\nF. (to A. V. B.) Now don't you get mixed up. (To M. R. H.)\nFeda doesn't want her to get mixed, but she's\ndescribing another house now. It's a more\nuniform shape, looks to Feda there would be one,\ntwo, looks to Feda three storeys. Feda sees two\nquite clear. It's a more compact shape than the\nother house, more commonplace, not so much\nspread out. The entrance is at the centre of\nthe house, not the side, it's got grounds around\nit, but a more ordinary sort of garden than the\nother one, there's grass coming up to the house\nmaking a space around the house. Isn't it a\nlittle bit sloping up to the house 1 She says\nsomething about a gate that was removed and\nanother put in its place.\nM. R. H. Correct.\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 385\nF. This isn't the other house is it ?\nM. R. H. No.\nF. But Feda thinks this is the house with cellars.\nIt has rather large windows on the ground floor,\nthe windows above are not so broad but there are\nmore of thern.\nM. R. H. What colour is the house ?\nF. It seems to be in two colours, as though the front\npart is one colour picked out in lighter, it's not\nall grey stone, because around the windows and\nthings seems different. She says especially that\nthat gate was changed entirely, and an entirely\ndifferent kind of gate put on.\nM. R. H. Correct.\nF. Something was done to one of the gate-posts,\nsomething was done not at the front but at the\nside of it. They had some difficulty about the\nnew gate, she says perhaps you wouldn't remember\nthat. It seems as if they had to take a piece\nout of the side part, but it's not very important.\nThe front door sticks out, you can stand in out\nof the rain, it has a ledge that shelters you, the\nfront door looks very dark to Feda. Around the\ndoor is very whitey.\nM. R. H. Stone ?\nF. Whitej-'Coloured stone. When you get inside there's\nfurniture suddenly inside the door, as you push\nthe door open, a dark, rather long piece of\nfurniture just behind it. She says there used to\nbe a railing round the house, it doesn't look to\nFeda like a house that would have had a railing,\nit looks more like a house that would have had\na wall around it bixt she says a railing ; can you\nremember ?\nM. R. H. I'm not sure.\nF. She says part of it is there still. She doesn't\ncontradict Feda when Feda says that's the house\nwith the cellars.\nM. R. H. Cellars ! But she said they were rooms you could\nlive in.\n\f386 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nF. She says it wouldn't hurt you if you had a meal\nthere.\nM. R. H. Does she think it's near the other house ?\nF. Not very near, not far away. She says it's not as\nnear as it ought to have been.\nM. R. H. What does she mean ?\nF. Feda can't make out. Feda thinks she means that\nthere was some time when she wished there wasn't\nso far between the houses. She thinks you ought\nto know. It is the house with the basement\nrooms.\nM. R. H. Feda, what makes confusion sometimes ? when she's\ngetting a thing well, then it goes all wrong.\nF. You see when she's in her own sphere she remembers\nthings quite clearly, but when she comes here\nit's like coming into a dark room, misty, and it\naffects her memory. It's awfully difficult for Feda\nsometimes, they remember one thing sometimes,\nand then go on to a bit of another, without\nmaking any difference. Was it at the end of\ndescribing the first house that she said about\nthe basement rooms ?\nM. R. H. Yes.\nU. V. T. Quite right, sometimes good descriptions go off at\nthe end.\nAs will have been noticed from the above, it took\nsome little time to disentangle the thread, and even then\nthere remain inaccuracies, or rather partial inaccuracies ;\nfor although Feda describes correctly another house which\nhad basement rooms, she appears to be undecided as to\nwhether they are rooms or cellars which she is describing,\nand whatever they are, she says that they are at the\nback of the house.\nThe description of a house which Feda gives during\nthis sitting of October, 25th, 1916, applies well to High-\nfield House, Malvern Wells.\nHighfield House was well-known to A. V. B. It had\nbelonged to me before I knew her intimately, she had\nstayed with me there, and was practically living with\n\fxxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 387\nme there at the time when we bought The White Cottage.\nThere were basement rooms at Highfield House, two of\nthem, as Feda says, but one was at the front of the\nhouse, the other at the side, and neither could be entered\nfrom the back of the house. There was also one large\nand rather remarkable cellar, but nothing was ever kept\nin it. Highfield was a more uniform house than The\nWhite Cottage and had three storeys. It was a much\nlarger house but more common-place. The front door\nwas in the middle of the front of the house, it had a\nstone porch over it, rather a deep porch, the inside of the\nporch was of whitey-coloured stone or cement, and the door\nitself was of very dark oak. The garden of this house\nwas certainly more ordinary than that of The White\nCottage, and there was a small grass plot coming up\nagainst the house at the front, and another at the side.\nThere was a steep drive up to the house, which approach\nFeda, however, only sees as being a little bit sloping.\nWe now come to an interesting point, for Feda speaks\nabout a gate which was removed, and says that a gate\nof a totally different kind was put in its place. This is\nwhat was actually done after A. V. B. and I left High-\nfield. A large iron gate was removed at the entrance\nto the carriage drive, and a small and very ugly wooden\ngate, rather like a door, was put in its place. A. V. B.\noften remarked on this change when passing the house.\nThe windows of Highfield are correctly described, as is\nthe colour of the building, which was of grey stone with\nfacings of a fighter- coloured bath stone or some such\nmaterial. The windows, as Feda says, were surrounded\nby this lighter-coloured stone. As will have been noticed\nA. V. B. lays special stress upon the change in the gate,\nwhich is evidential. I am not quite clear as to what\nis meant regarding \" something \" which is said to have\nbeen done to one of the gate posts. I have a vague\nrecollection that we did hear that a five-barred gate\nwhich had been put to a newly constructed motor drive\nhad been found to be too narrow, but my memory must\nnot be taken to be infallible on this point.\nDuring the time when A. V. B. and I lived at High-\n2b\n\f388 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nfield there was rather a long piece of furniture just\nbehind the front door. There were railings around High-\nfield House, at least around three sides of it, I do not\nthink they went all round the house. When A. V. B.\nis reported to say that a part of the railing \" is there\nstill \" we may suppose, as we were obliged to do with\nregard to the new gate, that she has retained the memory\nthat the house changed hands, and that both the house\nand grounds were greatly altered by the new owners.\nThey did leave, however, a part of the railing at the back\nof the house. Feda is rather evasive in her statement\nregarding the proximity of Highfield to The White Cottage.\nI should say that the two houses were half a mile to a\nmile apart. I do not quite understand what can be\nmeant by there having been some time when A. V. B.\nwished that these houses had been nearer together, unless\nshe should be remembering vaguely our rather trouble-\nsome move, or the very marked rise in cab fares which\nwe had to put up with when we went to The White\nCottage, which was looked upon as being considerably\nfurther from the station than Highfield.\nWe have given Feda's own explanation of the reason\nfor the confusion with regard to the basement rooms.\nIn subsequent sittings Feda has become quite clever in\ndetecting these sudden jumps from subject to subject,\nor conceivably A. V. B. has become more skilled and\ncareful in her transitions, though just such another muddle\ndoes occur much later on, during a sitting with which\nwe shall presently deal. In the course of this present\nsitting of October 25th, 1916, a return was made to The\nWhite Cottage, in connection with which it was said that\nA. V. B. liked it much better than the other house\n(namely Highfield), and that she seemed to think it funny\nthat she should have liked it best. Now A. V. B. during\nher lifetime often remarked to me that she thought it\npeculiar of herself to prefer the rather humble White\nCottage to the more luxurious Highfield House.\nIn further connection with The White Cottage, during\nthis same sitting were given the letters W. and C, and\nA. V. B. also said that there was a place called L. not\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 389\nvery far away, in which some building had been turned\nto an entirely different purpose owing to the war. The\nL. is correct for Ledbury, a town a few miles from The\nWhite Cottage, and well-known to A. V. B., in which\ntown The Upper Hall, a dwelhng-house, has been turned\ninto a hospital owing to the war. One or two initials\nwere also given quite correctly as pertaining to people\nin the neighbourhood. A description was also given of\nthe Roman Catholic Church which A. V. B. attended,\nand this description was not only correct with regard\nto the appearance of the church, but was remarkably\npertinent with regard to the pohcy of a recently appointed\npriest in his conduct of parish affairs. A correct des-\ncription was also given of a certain walking-stick which\nA. V. B. had constantly used.\nAnother walking-stick was alluded to in these words.\n\" She says do you remember that she had one that hurt\nher hand. It wasn't comfortable\u2014it strained her hand.\"\nI denied all knowledge of this, but A. V. B.'s allusion\nwas subsequently verified in rather an unexpected manner\nten months after the sitting. Lady Troubridge was staying\nwith A. V. B.'s daughter, and prior to a country walk\nwas invited to select a walking-stick from a stand in\nthe hall. She proceeded to examine the sticks, and was\non the point of choosing one, when A. V. B.'s grand-\ndaughter, who was standing near, exclaimed :\n\" Oh\n!\ndon't take that one, it has such an uncomfortable handle\n\u2014\nit strains one's hand.\" Struck with these words, which\nawoke a memory of those spoken at the sitting of\nOctober 25th, 1916, Lady Troubridge asked: \"Who does\nthis stick belong to ?\n\" and A. V. B.'s grand-daughter\nanswered that it had belonged to her grandmother, A. V. B.\nA. V. B.'s daughter, who was coming downstairs at the\ntime, overheard the statement and confirmed it, commenting\nalso upon the uncomfortable straining nature of the handle\nof the stick under discussion. As a matter of fact, quite\napart from the question of this walking stick, it was an\nidiosyncrasy of A. V. B.'s to strain her wrists and hands\nvery easily.\nOne thing occurred in this present sitting which I\n\f390 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nthink we must record, although as far as we can see it\nhas no meaning whatsoever. The allusion came suddenly,\nwith nothing to lead up to it. There had just been some\nfairly accurate references to clothes formerly worn by\nA. V. B., when suddenly the following words occurred:\nF. She doesn't smile you know, and yet she's saying\nshe had a wild idea of having an Ark, she thinks\nyou should know.\nM. R. H. What does she mean ?\nF. Feda thinks like Noah had, she says you ought to\nknow, she's spoken of it to you. She says, keep\na clear and faithful account of this, you will\nunderstand after what I mean. Feda thinks she\nmeans a kind of boat. Feda has asked her would\nshe have it on the sea ? She says she was not\nso ambitious as that, she would have had it on\na river. She thought of it in the spring.\nM. E. H. I am very stupid.\nF. She says no. if positions were reversed I shouldn't\nknow. I don't expect you to remember on the\nspur of the moment, but you will later, and be\npleased that I spoke about it. She didn't do it.\nbut spoke of it, and it had been calculated about.\nShe says : \"I had ideas regarding an Ark.\"\nWe have really not the slightest idea what this means.\nDiiring the ten months that have elapsed we have thought\nit over carefully, without so far finding any solution ; on\nthe other hand it does seem curious that Feda, un-\nsolicited, should have volunteered such an unnecessarily\nodd statement. Some day we may find that it was\ncorrect, yet A. V. B. seems to think that \/ should know\nabout it, and I certainly do not, or, if I ever did, have\ncompletely forgotten it ; an improbable hypothesis, as\nmy memory is particularly clear regarding everything that\nconcerned A. V. B. One point is worthy of notice in\nthis connection, and it is this : Mrs. Leonard herself has\nstayed on house-boats, and has told us, Avhen in the normal\nstate, that she enjoys that form of vacation. It is possible\nthat some memory in the medium's sub-conscious mind\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 391\nhas here obtruded itself, and, its source being unrecognised\nby Feda, has been mistaken for a memory of A. V. B.'s.\n(B) Teneriffe.\nWe propose next to deal with a series of references\nto another particular place. The first of these occurred\non November 22nd, 1916, the second on January 3rd,\n1917, the third on January 17th, 1917, and the fourth,\nand up till now the last, on May 23rd, 1917. There\nappears to us to be something very natural in this\nrepeated recurrence to one topic. At all events it would\nseem to suggest that the memory of past events is not\nlimited to a flash during an isolated sitting, but is very\nmuch a part of the intelligence purporting to communicate.\nOn November 22nd, 1916, at a sitting which was taken\nby me, Lady Troubridge acting as recorder, the following\noccurred :\nF. She says she used to do climbing. Feda can't\nimagine her climbing. Feda doesn't think she'd\nlike it. (To A. V. B.) Where did you climb ?\n(To M. R. H.) She is saying something funny to\nFeda, that she climbed up the side of a house !\nM. R. H. What does she mean ?\nF. She's showing Feda something like a wall, the wall\ndoesn't seem quite straight, it is rounded and\nthen goes up, and then a ledge, and then up\nagain, and she puts her foot and then her stick\non a ledge, and then goes up onto another ledge,\nand now she's getting on top. Oh, and Feda\nsees now that it is nothing to do with a house.\nIt seems to Feda as though this place were far\naway from here ; it looks to Feda almost like\nprecipices, and Feda sees a small horse, no, it's not\na horse, it's more like a mule, and someone is leading\nit along the ledge. Oh, they are nasty places.\nM. R. H. (To A. V. B.) I think I recognise the place, but not\nyour climbing.\nF. It is a funny place, and doesn't seem as though\nyou would take a horse there, but they do lead\n\f392 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nhorses up those ledges, and this horse has a\nsaddle across, with something hanging on either\nside. Now the man is pulling it up somewhere.\nYour Ladye is not at the top, she's more nearly\nat the bottom. She has a stick and she is\npointing with the stick to show how people do\ngo up, but she's not going herself, she's pointing\nto the ledges, they are not straight like steps.\nFeda sees it more clearly now, you go up side-\nways, and then up sideways again. It is a\nnasty place.\nM. R. H. What country is this in ?\nF. Not this country. There looks to Feda to be a\nkind of valley with something steep rising up\non each side ; then you go along the valley,\nand at the end of it there is a little opening,\nbut beyond the opening something steep rises\nup again. She seems to think a lot of that\nplace ; she's very much interested in it.\nM. R. H. I know the place.\nF. She takes Feda along, and there seems to be a\nkind of opening out of the vallej^, and then you\ngo along a kind of winding road. As you look\naround you, you can see the ground rising all\nround, and it must be sunrise or sunset, because\nFeda sees half of a great big sun sticking up over\none of the banks, it's either setting or rising.\nM. R. H. What colour is that road 1\nF. It's dusty looking and funny looking, it's not an\nordinary road ; Feda didn't feel sure it was a\nroad.\nM. R. H. (to A. V. B.) Try and give Feda an idea of the\ncolour of it.\nF. It looks white rather to Feda, but it isn't very\nsmooth either, it's like as though\u2014oh, it's not\nwhite at all, it's greyish colour, it's awful funny !\nFeda Avouldn't like to walk along it with bare\nfeet, it's not exactly powdery, it's like in bits,\nit feels to Feda like walking on cinders. As you\nwalk it crushes under your feet, it's a kind of\n\fLxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 393\ngrey colour, but not quite like any ordinary grey\ncolour you see. Funny, it's very uneven too,\npeople walking along it lift up their feet, it's\nAvhat you would call here very heavy walking.\nIt seems to Feda as though you have to prepare\nfor a good walk, this road goes a long way.\nIt seems to Feda that further on it forms a kind\nof bridge just for a little way, Feda can look\ndown on either side of it.\nM. R. H. Are you sure you mean the same road ?\nF. She says no, it isn't the same road, but it's con-\nnected with the same place, she forgot to tell\nFeda that she had changed to another road.\nM. R. H. All right.\nF. She says, do you think it strange that she comes\nand shows you bits of scenery 1\nM. R. H No, it's a good proof.\nF. She says she gets the unexpected things through\neasier. She says you have pleasant recollections\nof this place, but that some people haven't\npleasant recollections of it at all. Feda thinks\nshe means that there has been some accident\nthere, and that you heard of it when you were\nthere, Feda thinks it might have happened to\nanyone too venturesome, Feda thinks she means\nsomeone falling. Think it over and tell her about\nit next time. She's going on a little journey\nfrom there, she says you both stayed at another\nplace.\nM. R. H. Perhaps we did.\nF. It's not a long way from there, she says you were\nheld up at two places, put it down and perhaps\nyou will remember. She says there were two\nextremes of climate in the place you went to,\nFeda doesn't know what that means, she says\nin a way you can taste two climates at once.\nM. R. H. I think that's got through wrong.\nF. Feda thinks so too, but she won't go back on it,\nshe will have it that there are two extremes\nof climate ; but you can't have two climates at\n\f394 Miss Radclyjfe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nonce, can yon Mrs. Twonnie 1 She Avon't go\noff it, so Feda's going to try and get her off it.\nShe says something about two conditions of\nfeeling in that place that everyone could feel,\nand she sticks to her point. She says she used\nto enjoy herself so much with you, she says\nyou had heaps and heaps of happy times.\nNow the whole of this description is in my opinion\nabsolutely applicable to Teneriffe, in the Canary Islands,\na place to which A. V. B. and I were much devoted,\nbut which neither of us had visited for more than six\nyears prior to her death. If we assumed that Mrs.\nLeonard had taken normal means to acquire knowledge\nregarding A. V. B.'s life, she could have ascertained\nthe fact that A. V. B. had, at some period in her life,\nvisited Teneriffe. In A. V. B.'s will she mentions a\nbrooch that she lost and found at Teneriffe, giving no\ndetails beyond this, however, and there is nothing what-\never in the will to inform any one as to what period\nof her fifty-seven years of life saw A. V. B.'s visit to\nTeneriffe, and there is equally nothing to indicate that\nshe visited Teneriffe with me. I could not at first\nmake out the reference to her climbing, as she was not\nan active woman ; but the stupidity of the sitter is\noften quite remarkable. On returning home, I quickly\nremembered that A. V. B. had developed an abnormal\nactivity when at Teneriffe, owing no doubt to the bene-\nficial effects of the climate, and that on several occasions\nshe had taken long walks and climbs, and moreover that\nwe had often discussed with surprise her being able to\ndo so. Teneriffe is extremely mountainous, the mountain\npaths are mere ledges, and there certainly are precipices.\nFeda sees what she at first takes to be a small horse,\nbut what she afterwards thinks is more like a mule,\nbeing led along one of the ledges. Now mules are\nconstantly led along these ledges, so probably are ponies,\nbut my memory is of mules and donkeys. Feda, however,\nforgets about the mule, and carelessly refers to this\nanimal again as a horse a few words further on. The\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 395\nsaddle said to be used on this horse or mule has some-\nthing hanging on either side of it ; I think myself\nthat this is a reference to a pack-saddle, as A. V. B.\nalways insisted upon a pack-saddle for excursions, she\nbeing extremely dexterous in balancing herself thereon.\nWe next find Feda describing A. V. B. as being nearly\nat the bottom of a place, and indicating with her stick\nthe ledges above her. Feda appears to get a good impres-\nsion of these ledges, since she describes the mode of\nascent as \" going up sideways, and then going up side-\nways again'\"; this gives us the impression of -paths\nwinding up and round a mountain in successive ledges,\nand that is precisely what many of the mountain paths are\nlike at Teneriffe.\nWe next find Feda describing a valley which has some-\nthing steep rising up on each side of it ; she elaborates\nthis description by saying that you go along this valley,\nand that at the end of it you find a little opening, but\nthat beyond that opening something steep rises up again.\nHere, to my mind, we have an attempt at a description\nof the Baranco del Anavingo, a place visited by A. V. B.\nand me during our stay at Teneriffe. This Baranco was\na rock-strewn valley, with sheer rocks of a great height\nrising up on either side. If, after entering the valley,\nyou proceeded along it, you found that it ended in a\nvery curious manner ; the sheer rocks gradually closed\nin on you on either hand, leaving only what appeared\nto be a very small opening. I did not proceed very far\nthrough this opening, nor do I think that it would have\nbeen possible to have done so, since it appeared to grow\nnarrower and narrower, until finally blocked by un-\nscalable rock. After describing this, Feda says that she\nis taken along to another opening out of the valley, she\ndoes not actually say \"another\" opening, but one must\nsuppose that she is seeing the usual exit from the valley,\nsince she begins to describe a winding road onto which\nthis opening leads you. Now the road leading to and\nfrom the Baranco del Anavingo is a very peculiar one,\nin fact it would not be considered a road at all in any\nplace except the Canary Islands. It is nothing less than\n\f396 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\na solidified lava river left by the last eruption of the\nPeak of Teide.\nOn either side of this road the country is more or less\nof a mountainous nature, and it is interesting that A. V. B.,\nthrough Feda, manages to convey the impression of\nsunrise or sunset, since when A. V. B. and I started\non our homeward journey after our visit to the Baranco,\nthe sun was setting, making a fine red glow across the\nlava road. This made a deep impression on us both\nat the time, and I afterwards included a description of\nit in a short story, which, however, fortunately for this\ndescription of Feda's, has never appeared in print. Feda\ndescribes this lava river very well indeed ; it is, as she\nsays, not exactly powdery\u2014but \" like in bits,\" its colour\nis a curious and rather forbidding grey. It is excessively\nrough and uneven, and I have no doubt that if Feda\nwas made to sense walking on this road, it did feel to\nher like walking on cinders, since that is precisely what\nthe road is composed of. Feda describes this road as going\na long way, which it does ; there are several miles of it\nwhich had to be traversed, though we did not walk it, as\nwe were riding. She then says that this road forms a kind\nof bridge, and I think that even with reference to this\nparticular road she may be partially right, though at the\ntime I was not sure. In any case when I ask her if\nshe means that the bridge is on this same road she says\nthat A. V. B. says that it is not. Now unless Feda\nwas acting upon my suggestion (which is unusual with\nher, she being indeed more given to stubborn tenacity,\nas witness the allusion to the two climates), I con-\nsider that A. V. B. had jumped to another memory,\nand was making a rather poor effort to describe some\nof the mountain paths. These mountain paths were\nformed by narrow stone aqueducts, which had occasion-\nally an uncomfortable way of running on after the\nmountain ceased to be. In this manner they spanned\ndeep chasms. It will be noticed that Feda's actual\nwords are : \"It forms a kind of bridge just for a little\nway, Feda can look down on either side of it.\" This is\nprecisely what those little aqueducts do, and if A. V. B.\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 397\nhas retained any memory at all regarding the Canary\nIslands, I think she would remember those aqueducts,\nsince she constantly terrified me by crossing them, I\nbeing unable to follow her owing to vertigo. Had the\nlava-river road been meant, Feda should not, I think,\nhave said \" a kind of bridge \"\u2014nor should she have said\nthat the road formed it. My recollection of bridges on\nall roads other than the mountain paths is that they\nwere ordinary stone bridges. I am not at all sure that\nthere was not one of these ordinary bridges on the lava\nroad. But to my mind Feda's words seem rather\nto suggest an aqueduct such as I have described. It\nis a correct and a natural touch when A. V. B. speaks\nthrough Feda of the pleasant recollections connected with\nthat place (meaning Teneriffe). Just after this reference\nto our own pleasant recollections there comes an allusion\nto some people who did not have pleasant recollections\nof the place. And it happens that while A. V. B. and\nI were staying in the vicinity of the Baranco del Anfivingo\nwe heard of some people in the neighbourhood who had\nhad a very tragic experience, or at least it impressed us\nas having been tragic ; we visited their house and saw\none of the people in question, and the circumstances made\nso deep an impression on us that I afterwards used the\nincident for a short story, the same unpublished story\nto which I have previously alluded. The tragedy had,\nhowever, nothing to do with a mountain accident,\nand one could have wished that just here Feda would\nhave refrained from supplying her own interpretation of\nthe impression received by her. The reference to two\ndifferent climates might possibly apply to the extreme\ncold which is sometimes experienced when crossing some\nof the higher passes. The climate in the vaUeys of the\nCanary Islands is semi-tropical, but some hotel acquaint-\nances of ours made an excursion over the passes, where\nthey told us that they had experienced severe cold.\nUnless the words refer to this, we do not understand them.\nI have omitted to mention that A. V. B. is quite right\nwhen, after describing the Anfivingo, she goes on to say\nthrough Feda that we were both staying at another place.\n\f398 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nWe were staying at Santa Cruz, and had only remained\nin the vicinity of the Anavingo for a couple of nights\nand I think she is also right in saying that we were held\nup at two places.\nOn January 3rd, 1917, at a sitting taken by me, Lady\nTroubridge recording, we got another reference to Teneriffe.\nDuring this sitting A. V. B. spoke through Feda about\na certain pair of monkeys. She said that they had\ngreatly amused her, and that she did not think that such\nanother pair of monkeys existed, etc. Feda described\nthese monkeys as being at the end of a little path. Now\nin the garden of the Hotel Quisisana at Santa Cruz there\nwere at the end of a little path a pair of monkeys and\none baby monkey, that A. V. B. and I used to watch\nby the hour ;\nthey were an intensely amusing family,\nand were the only monkeys in which I ever knew A. V. B.\nto take an interest during our life together. This refer-\nence to the monkeys occurred suddenly in the sitting,\nand was in no way solicited. Two letters, A. and H.,\nwere given as having some connection with the monkeys.\nI cannot up to the present place these letters. Together\nwith the mention of the monkeys was given a fairly good\ndescription of the Hotel Quisisana at Santa Cruz, where\nwe stayed ; the description including, among other things,\na statement that the door of this \" house \" was elevated\nfrom the ground, that you went up steps to it, that the\ncorner of the house was rounded, that there was some-\nthing around the house under the roof which formed an\nup and down pattern ; that the windows were not\nuniform, and finally that there was a little terrace with a\nslope down from it, upon which terrace A. V. B. used\nto sit, having something brought to her while she sat\nthere. There was such a terrace where A. V. B. used\nto sit ; sometimes coffee would be brought to her there.\nThe rest of the description was also correct. At this\nsame sitting A. V. B. said through Feda in reference to\nthe climate of the place :\n\" The weather was just beautiful,\nneither too hot nor too cold,\" which correctly describes\nthe climate of the Canary Islands.\nOn January 17th, 1917, we obtained a further reference\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 399\nto Teneriffe. I had told Feda that I was sure I knew\nwhat particular monkeys had been spoken of at the last\nsitting, and went on to say that I supposed them to have\nbeen monkeys in the garden of the hotel where we had\nstayed ; I did not of course mention the name of the hotel,\nor give any indication of where this hotel might be. After\nsome talk upon different matters the following occurred\n:\nF. She says, do you remember the hotel where the\nmonkeys were ?\nM. R. H. Yes.\nF. She says, it was not artistic, not pleasing to the\neye. She says that when you turned the corner\nand it came into view, you used to think how\nugly it was.\nM. R. H. Yes, we sometimes said so.\nF. She says she has stayed with you in artistic places,\nbut this building might have been a barrack or\nanything. She says it was fairly comfortable\ninside, a sort of heavy comfort, but judging from\nthe outside no one would have gone there at all.\nShe says, do you remember a very dark-skinned\nman there, she says he was very swarthy, and\nhad generally rather an oily appearance.\nM. R. H. Yes, I think I do.\nF. She says he had dark eyes and black hair, and\nshe says you had to come across him. \"As a\nmatter of a fact,\" she says, \" we were always\ndodging him.\" She wasn't interested in him, he\nwasn't only there when you were, she says, he\nwas very much a fixture.\nM. R. H. Yes, I place him. We were very happy there.\nF. She says :\n\" Yes, and the climate was such a relief,\nit was so warm.\"\nM. R. H. (to A. V. B.) Can you remember Avhy we went there ?\nF. She doesn't seem able to get that through, but it\nwasn't just for a holiday, it was for a special\npurpose, and you didn't know whether that\npurpose would be accomplished there.\nM. R. H. Never mind, I don't approve of pressing questions.\n\f400 Miss Baddyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nF. One day she'll get it through. Mrs. Twonnie,\nweren't you very well then ?\nM. R. H. I don't quite understand that question, Feda.\nF. Feda means, were you not well when you went\nthere ? Feda feels that you were not very well.\nM. R. H. No, I was not very well.\nF. Feda knows it, because your Ladye has just said so,\nand she's showing you to Feda, pale and pulled-\ndown looking, and she says you. pulled up there,\nbut that you weren't well before you went there.\nM. R. H. Quite right. I expect some day she'll remember\nwhy I was ill then.\nF. Yes, she will, and she says that that place put new\nlife in you. She says it was not an ordinary\nillness that you had. (Sotlo voce : Worry ?\nWorry aboiit someone else ?) Feda can't get much\nmore from her, but she says there was worry\nabout someone else. She's got on to something\na bit different, and she says that she was antici-\npating that there might be a hitch about someone\nelse, who might somehow have indirectly prevented\nyour going away with her when you did.\nWith regard to this extract, the Hotel Quisisana was\ncertainly not artistic, it was a large and hideous\nbuilding, terribly ornate, having rather the appearance of\na cheap, imitation fortress. A. V. B. and I had always\nconsidered it a blot on the landscape. We found it\ncomfortable enough inside, though certainly not with what\nFeda calls \" a sort of heavy comfort.\" Lady Troubridge\nand I are inclined to think that this must have been a\nlittle personal touch of Feda's. And in view of the fact\nthat on January 3rd, 1917, A. V. B. refers through Feda\nto the beautiful climate of this place, and in the present\nsitting when referring again to the climate, speaks of\nit having been \" such a relief, it was so warm,\" this\nmistake re the furniture is, we think, a distinct point in\nfavour of the medium's honesty. It is a matter of fairly\ncommon knowledge that a heavy sort of comfort is not\nwhat you meet with in hotels in semi-tropical climates,\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 401\nquite the contrary. We find A. V. B. asking through Feda\nwhether I remember a dark-skinned man there, and the\ndescription which follows is exactly applicable to the\nmanager of the hotel, who was rather oppressively atten-\ntive. The words :\n\" She says, '\nYes, and the climate was\nsuch a relief, it was so warm ',\" suggest the fact that\nA. V. B. has retained a memory of her great distaste\nfor cold weather, which always made her feel ill and\nuncomfortable. When I asked A. V. B. if she remembered\nwhy we went there, I had hoped to get a simple state-\nment regarding a hunting accident ;\ninstead, however, I got\nthe indefinite reply which is often the result of putting a\ndirect question, but I did get the facts that I had not\ngone there just for a holiday\u2014that \/ was ill\u2014that the\nplace put new life into me, and that mine was not an\nordinary illness ; also that there had been worry about\nsomeone else who might have indirectly prevented our\ngoing there. My illness was the result of a fall out\nhunting, we certainly did not go to the Canary Islands\npurely for a holiday on that occasion, but, as Feda\nsays, for a special purpose, which we did not know\nwould be accomplished. The purpose was my ultimate\nrecovery, which it was hoped a sea voyage would assist.\nI did, as stated, pull up there. Prior to undertaking the\nvoyage we were much worried by a relation of mine, who\nwished to substitute a rest-cure for the intended voyage.\nIt is worthy of note that this first visit to the Canary Islands\nwas one of the only two occasions throughout my long\nfriendship with A. V. B. when my health and not hers\nwas in question.\nThere was no further allusion to the Canary Islands\nuntil May 23rd, 1917, upon which day I was the sitter\nand Lady Troubridge the recorder. The subject was\nopened by Feda almost immediately after Mrs. Leonard\nwent into trance ; what follows is rather a long extract,\nbut we feel that it must be given in full. After I had\npromised to think over a point connected with another\nmatter, Feda began speaking as follows :\nF. (Sotto voce : They says Mrs. Twonnie not at all\nstrong and ought to go away.)\n\f402 Miss Baddyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nM. R. H. Who says so ?\nF. Feda doesn't know, but it was some time ago, you\nweren't well, and you were told you ought to go\naway, and she took you away. It was a long way.\nM. R. H. Was it during her earth life ?\nF. Yes, of course.\nM. R. H. Then I understand.\nF. She says unfortunately she can't take you away now,\nbut she can go with you now, and then she feels\nthat you are taking her. She says that you\ntouched at two or three places that time when\nshe took you away. It was a nice journey, she\nsays. She says the going out there was delicious\nafter the first day or two.\nM. R. H. She's quite right.\nF. The first couple of days she says you could have\ndone without, but after that, she makes Feda\nfeel that it was some time during the third day,\nyou made up your minds to enjoy yourselves,\nand she saw you looking quite perky again, and\nwanting to take an interest in things. She says\nthe first days you didn't feel like it at all, but\nafterwards it went beautifully. Wait\u2014this is a\nplace called Cruz\u2014Cruz\u2014Cruth\u2014Cruz.\nM. R. H. Is she trying to give you something, Feda ?\nF. Feda is afraid that's only part of the word.\nM. R. H. It is only part of it.\nF. (Sotto voce : Cruth\u2014Vera\u2014Vera. Now Ladye, don't\nmix it up). She's mixing it up Avith something\nelse that she tried to say when she was con-\ntrolling herself, last time, she's thinking of two\nplaces and she's got hold of part of each. (Sotto\nvoce : Do try and forget the other place, Ladye.)\nCruz\u2014Cruth, it is a funny word. It isn't a word\nthat Feda's heard before. Cruth.\nM. R. H. That's right as far as it goes, ask her now where\nshe thinks it is.\nF. It isn't here, Mrs. Twonnie, it's some way away\nfrom here, it doesn't sound like a name that\nFeda knows at all.\n\fLxxvm.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 403\nM. R. H. Perhaps she'll get it through later.\nF She wanted to get it through.\nM. R. H. Well, I know what she means.\nF. And so does she ; she says it's a name that would\nmean something to you and her. (Sotto voce :\nLony\u2014Lony\u2014.) This sounds to Feda some-\nthing like Leony, it's not quite that but it's\nsomething like it, Feda can't get it now.\nM. R. H. Never mind, it was very good about the first two\nor three days, I'd forgotten about that until she\nreminded me of it.\nF. She says she hadn't. After that beginning part\ncame this Cruth word, the word doesn't finish\nwith one or two more letters, she's spread the\nAvord out a bit, it's not a short word, and Feda\ncan't get it. She says it was nice weather and\nnice air there and a nice sky at that place you\nwent to, she says the sky was blue and the water\nwas blue. (Sotto voce : Feda thinks water's green\nsometimes), well, she says it was blue there\nanyway.\nM. R. H. Yes, it was.\nF. And she says the water was clear, and that there\nwas a cloudless sky nearly turquoise colour, and\nthat it was warm and lovely. The place that you\nstayed at was near the water, she says you\ndidn't go inland to it, but it must have been\ncountry, too, because you could get out from\nit to where there were wooded and hilly places\nall round about. She says there was one wood\nwith flowers growing in it, flowers like you would\nhave to buy here or raise in gardens, but they\nwere growing wild in that j)articular wood, she\ndidn't notice them elsewhere. She's still worrying\nabout that word beghnnng with Cruth, and she\nsays there was a well-known place a few miles\nfrom the place you stayed at, that lots of people\nwent to visit, an awful well-known place, Mrs.\nTwonnie. She liked going there, but she liked the\nplace you stayed at best, the other place wasn't\n\f404 .Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nfar from your place, you could go to it by train\nor you could drive there, it was a sort of building,\npeople went there to look at it and walk about.\nM. R. H. I can't place that, is she certain about going there\nby train ?\nF. No, she isn't.\nM. R. H. Because it might be one of two places.\nF. Feda thinks she'd better leave out about that train,\nshe isn't too sure of it. No, she won't have Feda\nsay that, quite, she says she must wait and think ;\nshe says : \"I believe there were trains going close\nthere.\" (Sotto voce : Don't mix things up, Ladye).\nLook Mrs. Twonnie, there was a place called M.\nclose to where you were at\u2014M.\u2014she says ; she's\nquite sure it was M., it's not a very short name,\nFeda doesn't think, there seems to be about\neight letters in it. You didn't have a house in\nthe place where you stayed ; she's trying to show\nFeda a kind of hotel place, there are a good\nmany steps to it, not just a few steps, a flight\nright up to the front.\nM. R. H. That's correct.\nF. It looks almost like stairs inside a house, more\nthan just like steps. And there's a place where\nyou can walk about, connected with this house,\nbecause she's showing Feda not quite a house,\nbut a kind of promenade place, it looks to Feda\nas if people walked up and down in front of the\nhouse and at the sides of the house, too. She's\nshowing Feda that you could stand outside the\nwindows and look straight across, as though you\ncould watch joeople passing a few yards in\nfront of the windows. She tells Feda that people\nused to sit outside the house, some would be\nwalking and some sitting down, and it feels to\nFeda as though most of them had on light-\nlooking clothes.\nM. R. H. Yes, that would be right.\nF. When you get inside the house to which those steps\nlead up, you get into a sort of hall place, it's\n\fLxxvra.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 405\nnot a narrow passage, it's a hall more like a\nroom, and in this hall are places where you can\nsit down. And she says, do you remember a\nplace that is not quite a door, at least, if there\nis a door Feda can't see it, it's a place that\nseems to Feda to be on one side of the hall,\nthough Feda couldn't be quite sure which side\nof the front door it is ; as she shows it to Feda\nit seems to be a kind of archway ; of course,\nthere may be a door, but Feda only sees the\nopening.\nM. R. H. Well, at the moment I can't remember that.\nF. Now, she says, do you remember the furniture,\nit's what you would call Well, it's not at all\nlike this, Mrs. Twonnie. (Here Feda touches a\nheavily upholstered chair.)\nM. R. H. Do you mean it's not upholstered ?\nF. No, it's not, it's made of some kind of thin, light\nwood. Oh, you know, it's more like that stuff\nthey make baskets of. Well, some of the furniture\nin that hall place was like that, Feda knows it\nwas because she can see a chair, and near one\ncorner she can see a sofa, at least it's not quite\na sofa, but it's a seat that two or three people\ncan sit on. It's a much stiffer thing than what\nMrs. Una is sitting on now.\nM. R. H. That would be correct.\nF. And now Feda sees that there are plants in that\nhall place too, not just one plant, Feda sees\nseveral in different places, but they're not flowering\nplants.\nM R. H. That's right.\nF. Feda thinks there must have been something of a\nkind of a yellowish colour in this place, but you'd\nhave to go back there to see that, wouldn't you,\nMrs. Twonnie ? Ladye's just giving it in case\nyou should remember. Now, Mrs. Twonnie, in\nthis same hall place do you remember a sort of\ncabinet or something on one side ? One part of\nthis thing seems to be about as high as this\n\f406 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nmantelpiece, and above that there seems to be\nsome glass thing, a sort of glass thing over it,\nit's not very pretty and it doesn't stick out\nvery far.\nM. R. H. Now, I want to put a leading question Feda, it's\nabout those steps that lead up to the front door\nwhich you go through to get to the entrance hall.\nF. Yes, she remembers those steps particularly.\nM. R. H. Well then, ask her if she remembers some parti-\ncular thing which stood on top of those steps,\noutside the door ; and if she remembers that\nthing, can she remember to what use it was put,\nsometimes by us and sometimes by other people.\nF. Yes, she does remember, she remembers, but . . .\nM. R. H. Oh well, never mind if you can't get it, perhaps\nafter all there were several things outside the\ndoor.\nF. Well, the thing that she remembers seemed to\nstand rather high, it wasn't like a railing or any-\nthing like that, it was more like this (here\nFeda indicates something like a tripod with her\nhands). It's a thing that stands up. No, it\ncertainly isn't just a railing, it stands up and\nseems separate from other things, and there's\nsomething about it that seems rounded, it's\nshaped sort of round in one part, the part near\nthe top is certainly round in shape.\nM. R. H. Well, can she remember to what use we put that\nthing ?\nF. Feda can't quite make this out, she speaks as\nthough you were putting something on it like\nthat (here Feda makes a sort of slapping\nmovement with her hand). Feda doesn't know\nwhat she can mean, but she keeps on repeating\nthat movement, like that. (Feda again makes the\nslapping movement.) She knows quite well about\nthis thing, Mrs. Twonnie, and there's something\nabout it that amuses her, Feda thinks there's\nsomething about it that's a bit funny. (Sotto\nvoce : Used to catch something ? Catch, catch,\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 407\ncatch ?) Oh, Feda doesn't know what she\nmeans, yet it is to do with this place too.\nM. R. H. Oh well, never mind, leave it.\nF. Yes, but she doesn't like leaving things.\nM. R. H. Well, I'll try to remember afterwards.\nF. Now, do you remember anything of a grey colour\nin that hall ? Feda would call it a stone colour,\nit was something like carved, you know, like the\nthings you call heads, this one seems to have\nbeen part of a wall.\nH. I can't remember.\nMrs. Twonnie, through that opening that Feda\ndescribed in the hall, you can turn down a\npassage and go into a room, it's not a small\nroom either, quite a big one ; and in that room\nFeda sees several tables, and there are not just\none or two windows, there are several big\nwindows, they run up high, and yet they're\nlow down to the ground. Oh, and there are a\ngood many tables, some of them are near the\nwindows, and there seems to be a bigger one\nin the middle of the room. Now, she says\nthat this room is on the floor that you came\nin at, what you call the ground floor, and yet\nit doesn't seem to Feda to be like the ground\nfloor of this house, Feda means the medium's\nhouse, because Feda gets the impression that\nwhen you look out of one of those windows you\nseem to be raised up, not at all like here. Yes,\nand you seem to look down on things.\nM. R. H. I understand that.\nF. Feda would think that this room was a corner\nroom, because from the windows you can cer-\ntainly see two ways. (Sotto voce : Yes, you\ncan, Ladye). And Feda thinks that there are\nseveral mirrors in this room, several awful big\nones. One part of the room looks over quite\na wide view but out of some of the other windows\nit doesn't, it's as though out of the other windows\nyou looked on walls, or something like that,\nM. R.\nF.\n\f408 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nanyhow it's as though walls or some places came\nup closer, and prevented the view. She says that\nthat place belonged to the more careless part of\nyour life together, she was weller then, and there\nwas nothing that interfered with you both ; she\nsays that at that place you were together all\nthe time, both of you being able to do every-\nthing, and not having to worry about time or\nanything else. (Here some people were des-\ncribed as having been at the hotel, and as I\ncould not definitely place them we have omitted\nthe descriptions for the sake of brevity. It is\nnot improbable that people answering to the\ndescription may have been in the hotel with us,\nbut if so, they did not make a very deep im-\npression on me, as I have forgotten them. We\nalso omit the description of the manager of the\nhotel, which occurs again in this sitting, as it\nhas already been given in a previous sitting. In\nthe present sitting, however, Feda adds these\nwords to his description :\n\" He used to come in\nand walk around the rooms, that sort of thing.\"\nWe give these words, as they add value to the\ndescription, being, as they are, distinctly suggestive\nof an hotel manager. We will now resume\nFeda's remarks.)\nF. Oh, now she's showing that letter M. again in\nconnection with this place. Feda can't make\nout why, but it must have some connection.\nAnd there's a letter that looks like a C. too,\nand that has a bearing on this place. You see,\nMrs. Twonnie, she says that this place is on the\nwater, it's very close to the water indeed, and\nnow she's trying to show Feda the position of it,\nit's like this\u2014supposing you were on the sea, you\nsee the land and a bit of it seems to stick out\nlike a tongue of land into the sea, it seems to\ngo like this (here Feda draws wildly in the air,\nappearing to indicate hills, etc.).\nM. R. H. I can't quite understand all that, Feda.\n\fLxxvni.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 409\nF. Do you know anything about an island, that is\nnot far from there ?\nM. R. H. Yes, I do know something about an island, how\nwas that mention of an island given to you,\nFeda ?\nF. She suddenly said :\n\" Island, island, island,\" some-\nthing seems to have reminded her of an island\nthere, she keeps on showing Feda a piece of land\nstanding in the middle of water, and she says :\n\" It's a piece of land standing in water.\"\nM. R. H, What is ?\nF. That place is, she says. The place is an island.\nM. R. H. Yes, it is an island.\nF. She says that place is called Ter\u2014ter\u2014terra\u2014Oh !\nFeda can't quite get it, but she wants to say\nthat it's a place called Ter\u2014Te\u2014no, Feda can't\nget it, but it starts Te. It's Tener\u2014Tener\u2014\n\u2022\nTen\u2014Ten\u2014What, Ladye ? Tener\u2014\nM. R. H. Tener is right.\nF.

She keeps\non saying an island, it's an island she says, and\nshe says it's a nice place, she says :\n\" Teneriffe !\n\"\nDo you know, she pushed that through suddenly ?\nShe pretended that she was exasperated at your\nnot understanding. She thought that Feda w ould\nget hold of it if she pretended to be cross. Now,\nshe's saying there's that place called M. again,\n\u2014\nMasagar\u2014Masagar\u2014Madaga\u2014Maza.\nM. R. H. Maza is right, Feda.\nF. Mazaga\u2014Mazager\u2014Mazagi\u2014Mazagon\n\u2014\n(We here omit several other efforts on Feda's part\nto pronounce the name, which efforts end with\nMazagal).\nM. R. H. No, not quite Mazagal, Feda.\n\f410 Miss Baddyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nF. Mazagan !\nM. R. H. That's right, Feda. Well, what about Mazagan ?\nIs Mazagan the M. that you first mentioned ?\nF. No, it isn't, she suddenly thought of Mazagan and\ngot it through. Mazagan and Teneriffe. She\nsomehow couples them together ;\nMazagan, she\nsays it's a place, it's not somebody's name.\nM. R, H. Quite right.\nF. She can't get any more about that, but it wasn't\nthe first M. She was thinking of the first M.\nand that thought led her on to this one.\nM. R. H. Is the first M. a place ?\nF. Yes.\nM. R. H. Is the first M. in Teneriffe ?\nF. No, she says.\nM. R. H. Had it anything to do with our journey to\nTeneriffe ?\nF. Well, it wasn't in Teneriffe, but it had to do with\nyour journey there. At all events it was a kind\nof objective, she keeps on saying something about\nfor after.\nM. R. H. An objective for after we got to Teneriffe ?\nF. No, that's not right, not after you went to Teneriffe,\nshe means that you knew about this M. place\nfrom the first, it was before you got to Teneriffe.\nM. R. H. Do I understand that this M. place came before\nwe got to Teneriffe or did it come after ?\nF. Look, Mrs. Twonnie, Feda didn't think so at first,\nbut now she says that the M. came before\nTeneriffe, and that is what she meant by saying\nthat it's an objective, you'd thought of it before.\nIn this fourth and last extract we get a more prolonged\ndescription of the Canary Islands. It is led up to, as\nwill have been seen, by a reference to my state of health,\nwhich, as we have already said, was the first cause of\nA. V. B. and myself visiting Teneriffe. The first evidential\npoint to which we would refer in the present description\nis the allusion to the journey out ; this occurs towards\nthe beginning of the extract and is elaborated towards\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 411\nthe end. A. V. B. says through Feda that she and I\ntouched at one or two places when she took me away.\nThis is correct, as it happens that, for the sake of the\nlong sea voyage, we went to Teneriffe via Morocco ;\nand here I would point out that it is not usual for\npeople intending to make a long stay at Teneriffe to go\nby that route. We were the only passengers on the boat\nwho left the ship at Teneriffe. The Royal Mail Steam-\nship Company used to run ships from London to Madeira\nand back, taking Gibraltar, Morocco and the Canary Islands\nen route. It was on one of their ships that we went.\nMost people not intending to make the round trip go,\nI believe, by a more direct route which gets them to the\nCanary Islands in about a week. A. V. B. speaks\nthrough Feda about the conditions during the first two\nor three days of our journey, saying that after these\nfirst few days it was delicious. This is a good point,\nfor it so happens that we ran into almost Arctic cold\nduring the first two or three days of our voyage ; the\nship was small, the weather abominable, and we wished\nmany times that we had not left home. We often used\nto remind one another afterwards of those first few days\nof misery ;\nthey being passed, the remainder of the voyage\nwas, as Feda says, delicious.\nWe next find Feda struggling with the name \" Cruz,\"\nand getting the word \" Vera \" tacked on to it, which is,\nof course, a mistake. The place to which we think that\nA. V. B. intended to refer was not Vera Cruz, but Santa\nCruz in Teneriffe, and it is interesting to notice just here\nthat Feda seems cognisant of the fact that A. V. B. men-\ntioned the word \" Vera \" during a personal control at the\nsitting prior to the present one. We think that during that\ncontrol A. V. B. was attempting to say \" Viareggio,\" a place\nwhich she also knew. Feda seems to think that A. V. B.\nis confounding some other place with this \" Cruz \" in\nthe present sitting, but Lady Troubridge is of the opinion\nthat Feda may have found the ready-made association\nof \" Vera \" and \" Cruz \" in the medium's brain, and\nwhile recognising it as erroneous, failed to recognise its\nsource. With regard to this mention of the word \" Cruz,\"\n\f412 Miss Radclyffe-HaU and Lady Troubridge. [part\nwe think it worthy of notice that Feda, after pronouncing\nit several times as \" Cruz,\" corrects the pronunciation\nto \" Cruth \"\u2014to which pronunciation she subsequently\nadheres. We think it is usual among English people,\nor at all events among those of them that have not\ntravelled, to pronounce these Spanish names as written,\nmany English people being actually ignorant of the\nSpanish lisp which substitutes in certain instances a \" th\n\"\nfor the sibilant sound. A. V. B., however, being acquainted\nwith Spanish, always instinctively used the correct\npronunciation, and in the sitting under consideration\nit almost seems as though she attempts to correct Feda's\nmistake. The implication that the place \" Cruz \" is\na long way away is of course correct. What the word\n\" Leony \" means is not apparent, nor is it apparent\nwhy Feda says that the word (supposedly \" Cruz \") doesn't\nfinish with one or two more letters ; it is evident that\nFeda is somewhat muddled just here. The turquoise\ncoloured sky, etc., are features of the Canary Islands,\nas is, of course, the warm and lovely weather. It is\ncorrect to say that the place we stayed at was near\nwater, and it is rather interesting to note the statement\nthat we did not go inland to it, because, Santa Cruz,\nwhere we stayed, was reached direct by ship. In the\nordinary way, however, I think I am right in saying that\nmost people making a long stay at Teneriffe do so at\nOrotava, a town which must be approached by an inland\nroute, although it is also by the sea. Unlike most of\nthe other visitors, A. V. B. and I visited Orotava for\na few days only, making Santa Cruz our headquarters.\nAs stated through Feda, there are hilly places round\nSanta Cruz, though I cannot remember that they were\nparticularly wooded. A memory appears to have been\nretained of one special wood, wherein grew flowers not\nusually found wild. This is correct, as such a wood\nexists and was visited by us. It was not very far from\nSanta Cruz, and I remember that we remarked upon\nfinding some Arum Lilies growing there wild, which we\nhad not seen elsewhere on the island.\nThe well-known place said to be near Santa Cruz.\n\fLxxvin.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 413\nwhich was a sort of building, may refer to an old Spanish\nbuilding having a very beautiful courtyard or Patio\nInterior. We visited this building, and my impression\nis that it was then being used as a scholastic institution.\nMy memory is not clear on this point, but I presume\nthat it must have been some sort of show place, other-\nwise Ave should not have heard of it. Regarding this\nplace, a mistake is made, however, since A. V. B. speaks\nthrough Feda of reaching it by train or driving, she\nshould have said by tram or driving. The town in which\nthis building was situated could be reached by tram or\ncarriage, there were no trains on Teneriife. The words\ntrain and tram are very similar, and if we wish to be\nlenient we may suppose that the communicator said tram,\nand that Feda mistook it for train ; if we do not wish\nto be lenient, however, it is a bad mistake. On the\nother hand it is a point upon which a fraudulent medium\ncould obtain correct information from a tourist office.\nIt also appears probable that had Mrs. Leonard by some\nchance been possessed, to any extent, of normal knowledge\nof the Canary Islands, the salient fact of there being\nno trains on Teneriffe would surely have been included\ntherein. Just here in the sitting is given the letter M.\nas pertaining to a place near Teneriffe, the name of the place\nis said to have about eight letters in it. This M. occurs\nagain later in the extract, when we shall deal with it.\nWe next find Feda elaborating her description of the\nhotel at Santa Cruz, which, as will be remembered, was\nmentioned in previous sittings. In this present sitting\nshe returns to the long flight of steps leading up to the\nfront door, and there is every reason why A. V. B.\nshould have remembered these steps, since she particularly\ndisliked them ; so trying were they that I believe the\nmanagement have since been obliged to put a passenger\nlift from the garden to the entrance door of the hotel.\nThere were many terraced promenades in the garden of\nthe hotel, and it is correct to say that you could stand\noutside the windows and look straight across at any\npassers by. The light clothes said to . be worn by people\nare also correct, the climate bemg semi-tropical. The\n\f414 Miss Baddyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nlounge hall of the hotel is well described, there were\nseveral archways in this lounge hall, and here Feda\nappears to realise that she had wrongly described the\nfurniture of the hotel when referring to \"a heavy sort\nof comfort \" on January 17th, 1917. In this present\nsitting she describes it corrrectly. The furniture was\nwicker and light wood, and there were seats which would\naccommodate two or three people. There were plants\nin the hall as described. I cannot place either the yellowish\ncolour, or the grey carved thing said to be in the hall.\nThese statements may be correct, but I am not in a\nposition to verify them. There was a cabinet in the hall\nof the hotel, used by the book-keeper, it was not very\nlarge, the lower part was of wood and the upper part\nof it consisted of glass panes, and was surmounted by\na clock and three electric lights. From the ground to\nthe opening of the cabinet would I think have been about\nthe height of an ordinary mantelpiece.\nThe leading question which I put regarding something\nwhich had stood on top of the steps outside the door\nreferred to a telescope on a tripod stand. As often\nhappens when a question is put point blank, I did not\nobtain the actual name of the object. In this case I\ngot a description which we consider barely applicable to\nthe telescope in question ; as will have been noticed\nFeda indicates with her hands something like a tripod,\nshe says that it is a thing which stood up, and which\nappeared to be separate from the other things ; this is\nto the good. She says also that there is something\nnear the top which is certainly round in shape. But\nthis description is vague, so I asked to what use that\nthing was put. Now why just here Feda makes a\nslapping movement with her hand we have never been\nable to imagine, but I quite understand why A. V. B.\nshould feel amusement, and remember something funny\nwith reference to the telescope, if that were meant,\nespecially as her amusement is followed by the words\n\" used to catch something. Catch, catch, catch.\"\nTeneriffe is not an easy place to leave, as it is difficult to\nprocure sea-passages, and the difficulty is greatly augmented\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 415\nby the fact that one never knows on what days the\nhomeward-bound boats are likely to arrive. It often\nhappened, therefore, when we were there, that prospective\npassengers would have had their trunks packed and in\nthe hall for several days, throughout which period they,\nor the porter of the hotel, remained with an eye glued\nto the telescope, in order to sight the ship as far\naway as possible. Their fussiness became a standing\njoke ;\nyet it was very necessary if the ship was to be\ncaught, because she would only make a short stay at\nTeneriffe, and there was usually great difficulty in getting\nthe luggage taken down to the wharf in time for her\ndeparture. On one occasion our trunks did not arrive\nalongside the ship until she had begun to move, and a\nbox of mine fell into the water in the rush of getting\nit on board.\nWe next come to a description of the dining room of\nthe Hotel Quisisana. Feda describes this room as being\nentered through an opening, or archway ; I think this is\ncorrect, but cannot quite remember. The dining room with\nits big windows is well described, and Feda's bewilderment\nregarding the position of this room is quite explicable.\nA. V. B. has apparently told her that the room is on\nthe ground floor, but it will be remembered that a very\nlong flight of steps has already been described as leading\nup to the entrance of this hotel, which will have\ngiven the impression that the ground floor was in the\nposition of the average first floor of a house ; this\nimpression is correct. Underneath this so-called ground\nfloor there was enough space for shops and an American\nbar, so it will be understood that it was unusually elevated.\nThe dining room was a corner room as Feda states ;\nit probably contained mirrors though I cannot be certain\nof that. From some of the windows, as Feda says, there\nwas a wide view, from others, as she states, there was not.\nI cannot remember that any wall came up close to the\nside windows. Feda herself does not seem quite sure\nabout this, she says :\n\" Anyhow it's as though walls or\nsome places came up closer and prevented the view.\"\nWhat did come up fairly close to the side windows was\n\f416 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\na bit of hill-land. From the windows commanding the\nwide outlook one got a magnificent view.\nA good touch occurs when A. V. B. says through Feda\nthat the place in question belonged to the more careless\npart of our life together, that her health was better then,\nand that there was nothing to interfere with us, we being\nable to do everything together. This is perfectly correct.\nWe now find Feda returning to the letter M previously\ngiven ; she also mentions a letter which she takes to be\na C, both of which letters are said to be connected with\nthe place in question. It is permissible, we think, to\ntake C as standing for the Canaries. We find Feda saying\nthat the place is on the water, and endeavouring to catch\nfrom A. V. B. the position of it. She cannot do this\ncompletely, but evidently gets the impression of an island.\nShe asks if I know of an island not very far from the\nplace ; and the real meaning of the word island is cleared\nup when I make Feda tell me how she got the mention\nof an island given to her.\nIn reply to my question she tells me that A. V. B.\nhas said :\n\" Island, island, island, it is a piece of land\nstanding in water.\" I then ask: \"What is?'\" to which\nFeda replies :\n\" That place is, she says. The place is\nan island.\" After which we find Feda after several efforts\nsuccessfully giving the name Teneriffe, in conjunction with\nthe fact that it is an island.\nNext we find Feda returning for the third time to the\nplace called M., and finally, after several mis-pronuncia-\ntions, accomplishing the word Mazagan. Now Mazagan\nis a port in Morocco which A. V. B. and I visited en\nroute to Teneriffe, and having admitted that that name\nis correct. I ask Feda whether the first M. mentioned\nstood for Mazagan, to which Feda replies in the negative.\nShe tells me that A. V. B. was thinking of the first M\u201e\nand that that thought led her on to Mazagan. She\nsays in reply to my question that the first M. is a place,\nand when I ask if it is a place in Teneriffe, she replies\nthat A. V. B. says \" No.\" At first she appears to think\nthat this first M. place was an objective from Teneriffe,\nbut she corrects this error, saying that we knew about\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 417\nthis M. from the first, and that it was not after, but\nbefore, we got to Teneriffe. Now this first M. would be\ncorrect for Mogador, the last port in Morocco touched at\nbefore arriving at Teneriffe ; it would also be correct for\nMorocco, and as it is said to have been an objective,\nI think that Morocco is meant.\nSection IV. Memory of a Motor Accident and of certain\nUncomfortable Physical Symptoms.\nWe will now proceed from the memory of places to what\nwould appear to point to a clear memory of certain\nuncomfortable physical symptoms, and of a motor accident\nwhich caused them.\nOn December 30th, 1916, Lady Troubridge took a\nsitting at which I recorded. Quite suddenly Feda showed\nsigns of being uncomfortable, moving about restlessly,\nand the following occurred :\nF. Oh, what is she doing ? Something funny, she's\ntwisting about. (To A. V. B.) What are you\ndoing ? Feda can't make out what she's doing,\nshe's moving about and speaking without saying\nany words (here Feda moves her lips without\narticulating). No, Feda is afraid she can't get\nthis, it's too wrapped up, Feda can't get it, she's\ndoing such funny things, like this : (here Feda\nrubs her neck with her right hand, downwards,\nfrom the back of the neck to the side).\nU. V. T. Interesting and very odd.\nF. She wants you to notice it.\nU. V. T. We do.\nF. She's opening her mouth to speak, and not letting\nwords come, it's got something to do with some-\nthing that happened before she passed on. (Here\nFeda bends her head forward and holds the back\nof her neck, then with her hand still on the\nback of her neck, she lifts her head and moves\nit stiffly from side to side, making a grimace.)\nMrs. Una she's screwing up her mouth and face.\nU. V. T. I think we understand that.\n\f418 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nF. It looks to Feda dreadfully uncomfortable.\nU. V. T. I do hope she is not uncomfortable now.\nF. Oh no, she's only showing that she moved her\nhead as though it were uncomfortable when she\ndid move it. It seems to Feda to have been\njust here, just where the knob is (Feda indicates\nfrom the seventh cervical upwards). Feda doesn't\nfeel it below that, but Feda feels just under the\nroots of the hair a kind of soreness, a tenderness,\nnot cpjite pain, a funny feeling. Feda wants to\nkeep moving like this (she again moves her head\nstiffly from side to side). It's as though, although\nit's uncomfortable to move, yet you want to move.\n(Feda now begins to rub her arm). She's making\nFeda feel a funny feeling in the arm, or is Feda\ngetting it from your arm ?\nU. V. T. It may easily be my arm, because I have had some-\nthing the matter with my arm lately.\nF. Wait a minute, no, it's her arm. She thinks that\nyour arm may have helped to put Feda on the\ntrack. You have like a toothache in your arm,\nbut hers was different to yours, she had a nasty\nfeeling, it made her arm feel limp, and though it\nfelt limp there was a heaviness in the arm too,\nthe fingers felt dry at the ends and nervy, as\nthough you wanted to keep moving them. No,\nit was not a pain like yours. She says, that\nthis means something to do with her before she\npassed on. Feda wonders why she wants to give\nit this morning.\nU. V. T. Ifs good, I'm interested, tell her.\nF. She says, she didn't only have that for a very\nlittle while though, it was spread over a time,\nthere was a cause for it which dated some time\nback, a cause for this thing there (here Feda\ntouches the back of her neck). Now she tries\nto show Feda that she sometimes breathed a\nlittle heavily (here Feda breathes in and out as\nif with difficulty), and then she used to move her\nhead, it was nasty. Do you know she had a\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 419\nvery peculiar feeling in her head. She knows\nmore about it now, Feda thinks, because she\nmanages to give it so well to Feda, it's not quite\nlike pain, it is as though something came from\nthe back which seemed to numb (here Feda\nstretches her neck up and bends her head back\nstiffly). It's a strange feeling.\nTJ. V. T. Well, I am glad she hasn't got it now, then.\nF. She's smiling. She's so glad she can get it through.\nU. V. T. Tell her it has very much pleased us, because we\nsee that she has remembered something that she\nought to have remembered.\nF. She stretched her head ! (Feda now touches the\nfront of her head a little to the side of the\ncentre.) There was something just here, but it\nwas different to that thing at the back, a different\ncondition somehow, it isn't cpiite a pain, it is\nas if there was something that caused pressure.\n(Feda again indicates the front of her head, then\nproceeds to hold her head with her hand.) Mrs.\nUna, it isn't like pressure in one particular spot,\nit's across there. (Feda indicates the front of the\nhead.) Do you know it gave her a heavy sort\nof feeling in her eyes, as though she wanted to\nhalf close them ; it wasn't awful pain, it was\nas though something got on the nerves and made\neverything all round feel funny.\nU. V. T. Did I understand you to say that this feeling was\nin the middle of the head or at the side ?\nF. It seems to Feda to begin in the middle and\nmakes the whole front feel funny. It was a\ndifferent condition to that at the back entirely.\nThis front condition was not exactly . . . Oh,\nFeda wishes she could find the word, it's im-\nportant, it makes all the difference, it's as\nthough this trouble in front was in some way\nmade to be, caused. Feda doesn't think that is\nquite right, but she seems to be saying that the\nfront part had been made bad, as though some-\nthing had made the funny sensation, the back is\n\f420 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\ndifferent, she wasn't made to have the back.\nShe says she wants you to clearly understand\nthat she's not worrying over it, but to some\nextent there was something that made her have\nthat strange feeling across the front part of the\nhead.\nU. V. T. We understand that, and now perhaps she can\ngive something that will tell us what caused\nthese feelings which you have described.\nF. She couldn't think very clearly,-\u2014what is she doing ?\nShe wants to jerk Feda in some way, it's a\nmovement that was partly unconscious. She wants\nto make Feda make a movement, automatic !\nU. V. T. What movement ?\nF. It's some particular movement that was connected\nwith these conditions. She is wanting to give\nFeda jerking, automatic, unconscious movements.\nFeda can't make out if she actually did move,\nbut she certainly wanted to. She says she\nthought Mrs. Twonnie was there.\nU. V. T. Where, when ?\nF. At a later stage she thought Mrs. Twonnie was\nthere. She thought Mrs. Twonnie was bending\nover her.\nM. R. H. So I was.\nF. She says that even then her mind worked a little\nbit strangely. She wondered how it seemed to\nother people.\nU. V. T. Were all these conditons just before she passed\nover or some time ago ?\nF. No, not just before she passed over, because she\nspeaks of later stages afterwards. She's going\nback for a good many of the things. It was not\njust before she passed, but do you know, though\nthere was a time in between, she certainly links\nthe two things up.\nU. V. T. Will she give the letter of the month when the\nfirst neck condition was caused ?\nF. She'll try. You say the letters of the month over\nout loud. (U. V. T. repeats the alphabet slowly,\n\flxxvih.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 421\nand is stopped at the letter V. by Feda ex\nclaiming\n11\nOh, she says, she has passed it \").\nU. V. T. I will make it easier by repeating only the letters\nof the actual months (U. V. T. repeats the first\nletter of every month and is stopped by Feda\nat the letter M.).\nF. Wait a minute. (U. V. T. waits, but Feda seems\nconfused.)\nU. V. T. Well, look here, I'll make it easier by saying the\nnames of the months of the year (U. V. T.\nrepeats the names of the months and is stopped\nby Feda at October).\nF. Oh, wait a minute. She doesn't want you to go\nfurther. She stopped Feda in two places. It\nseems to Feda it was somewhere around March\nor April and then between October and November.\nU. V. T. (to A. V. B.) I wish you could get that month\nconnected with the pain at the back of your neck,\ntry and stop me at the right month. (U. V. T.\nrepeats the names of the months again and is\nstopped by Feda at July).\nF. Feda can't get it. She is stopping Feda at different\nplaces, she knows that last place is wrong. She\nsays, \" No, no.\" Feda gets it that she makes\none condition happening one season, and one\ncondition happening in another season.\nU. V. T. She is right about seasons.\nF. Feda can't get the months.\nTJ. V. T. It is curious that she doesn't give what led up to\nthat feeling in her neck ; what caused it. (Here\nFeda suddenly begins jerking about in the chair\nrather violently.)\nF. (to A. V. B.) What do you want to jerk Feda for ?\n(Feda jerks up and forward almost out of her\nseat.) Mrs. Una, she says, she pitched forward,\nshe didn't fall or slide, she pitched ! Oh, now she\nsays :\n\" No, that's not quite right,\" she says she\npitched forward but a little to one side too,\nshe says it's not quite forward.\nM. R. H. She's right.\n\f422 Miss Radclyffe-Hall mid Lady Troubridge. [part\nF. (with a sigh of relief.) Now she doesn't worry Feda so\nmuch. She wanted to show Feda that it was\nnot softly falling, but jerking. (Here Feda puts\nher fingers just under the hair of the front of\nher head and draws in her breath with a little\nhissing sound as if in pain.) She says, when she\njerked like that there was something at the side,\nsomething she was afraid of, she says, it only\ncaught her eye, \" It was like a sudden flash,\"\nshe says, it's because it was so sudden that it\nimpressed itself on her.\nM. R. H. Good !\nF. (drops her head on her breast and assumes a collapsed\nposition.) She was doubled down like this. She\nmakes Feda feel funny all round her neck. That's\nall she can say about that.\nXJ. V. T. It has been splendid.\nF. She laid great stress upon that thing just catching\nher eye, it was like this : (here Feda makes a\nsudden wave of her hand sideways). Oh dear,\nit seems to have taken the power from us.\nDescribing that was hard work, she had to make\nFeda understand that she wasn't playing, at\nfirst.\nThe whole of the above description is applicable in\nevery detail to a serious motor accident which A. V. B.\nand I had on September 22nd, 1914, and to certain\nsymptoms accruing from injuries which A. V. B. then\nreceived. We will give the circumstances as briefly as\npossible, beginning, as Feda does, with the symptoms.\nIn that accident A. V. B. sustained, among others,\nthree injuries, the effects of which continued to trouble\nher up to the time of her death ;\nnamely, a chip off\nthe spinous process of one of the cervical vertebrae, a\nchip off one of the bones of the elbow, and two severe\nscalp wounds, one slightly to the side of the front of the\nhead, the other a little more towards the back, but also at\nthe side.\nThe result of the injury to the vertebra was a chronic\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 423\nstiffness of the neck, accompanied by much discomfort,\nto ease which A. V. B. was in the habit of rubbing\nher neck downwards from the back towards the side,\nwhich gesture was reproduced with startling exactness\nby Feda. As will have been remarked A. V. B. appears\nto wish to bring the gesture to our notice. Feda speaks\nof her opening her mouth and letting no words come.\nThis description suggested to Lady Troubridge and myself\na very familiar grimace often made by A. V. B. when in\nacute discomfort from her neck. We find Feda saying\ncorrectly that the above actions have something to do\nwith an occurrence before A. V. B.'s death, and here\nagain Feda makes a startlingly familiar gesture, namely,\nthat of placing the hand at the back of the neck with\nthe head bent forward, then with the hand still on the\nback of the neck raising the head and moving it from\nside to side making a grimace at the same time. A. V. B.,\nwhen uncomfortable, often did this, from the time of the\naccident to the date of her last illness. The position given\nby Feda regarding the seat of the neck injury is correct,\nand the tenderness said to be felt under the roots of the\nhair must of course have existed at the time of the accident.\nAfter moving her head once again stiffly from side | to\nside Feda begins to rub her arm ;\nfor a moment there\nappears to be some doubt in Feda's mind as to whether\nshe is not catching a sensation from Lady Troubridge's\narm, which was in contact with medium's. Feda, however,\ndecides that this is not so, and proceeds to diagnose\ncorrectly the type of pain being suffered by Lady Trou-\nbridge, which she says is different from that in A. V. B.'s\narm. Now A. V. B. suffered much pain owing to her\ninjured elbow, especially at first ; we do not know\nwhether her arm felt limp and heavy, but we have no\ndoubt that an injury to the elbow would produce a feeling\nof nerviness in the fingers ; we have all experienced this\nfeeling when we have knocked our funny-bone. The\nnext good point is made when A. V. B. says, through\nFeda, that she did not have these symptoms for a little\nwhile only, but that all this was spread over a time ;\nthat there was a cause which dated some time back for\n\f424 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Trotibridge. [part\nthe neck injury. As we have said, the accident occurred\nin 1914, over a year and a half before A. V. B. died.\nJust about here A. V. B. appears to wish to show,\nthrough Feda, another of her symptoms, namely, breath-\nlessness. She had suffered from breathlessness for some\ntime prior to the accident, and although it grew worse\nafter the shock it cannot be said that it was caused by\nthe accident, although it would almost seem as if Feda\nlinked the two things up together, since, after describing\nthe breathlessness, she says :\n\" And then she used to\nmove her head, it was nasty.\"\nIt may probably be correct to say that something came\nfrom the back of the head which seemed to numb ; at\nthe time of the accident the violence of the blow on the\nback of the neck must have caused a certain amount\nof numbness ; in any case A. V. B. was unconscious,\nand her medical attendant was in doubt for a time as to\nwhether or not she had fractured the base of her skull.\nHere, again, we find Feda making a familiar gesture ;\nthis time she does not touch the back of her neck with\nher hand, but stretches her neck up and bends her head\nback stiffly ; this also A. V. B. did constantly.\nNext we find Feda touching the front of her head a\nlittle to the side, and saying that there was something\njust there, but that it was a different condition from that\nat the back ; she also speaks of something which caused\npressure, and holds her head with her hand, as one might\nwhen suffering from a headache. Regarding the pressure,\nshe says that it was not in one particular spot, but\nacross the front of the head, and that this pressure was\ncaused, made to be. We have already spoken of the\ntwo scalp wounds sustained by A. V. B., which could\ncertainly be termed a different condition from the injury\nof the bone at the back of the neck. After the scalp\nwounds healed, up to the day of her last illness, A. V. B.\ncould never bear any pressure on the front part of her\nhead ; all her hats seemed to cause pressure, and Lady\nTroubridge and I can both remember days when she\nwould change her hat two or three times, complaining\nthat all her hats felt too heavy, and that she could\n\fLxxvni.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 425\nnot stand the pressure. Having got thus far, we en-\ndeavoured to find out whether any memory had been\nretained by A. V. B. regarding the cause of these symptoms.\nIt will be noticed that the question which we put to\nFeda regarding this gives nothing away ; and here again,\nas on many previous occasions, instead of getting a direct\nanswer, such as motor car, or accident, we receive rather\na long, drawn-out description, accompanied by a good\ndeal of pantomime.\nWe are told first of all that A. V. B. could not think\nvery clearly. It goes without saying that she could not\nhave thought clearly at the time. After that we get\nFeda saying that A. V. B. is trying to jerk her, and to\nconvey the impression that the movement was partly\nunconscious and automatic.\nNow the circumstances of the accident were these :\nA. V. B. and I were passing the Cross Roads at Burford,\nin our Limousine car, when suddenly a smaller car dashed\ninto the side of our motor with great violence ; the lady\nwho was driving the smaller car mistook, in her panic,\nthe accelerator for the brake ;\nconsequently the force of\nthe impact was enormous, and our heavy car was jerked\nbackwards and forwards several times before it finally\nfell over on to a stone wall, which it partly demohshed,\nand then our car partially rebounded on to the road.\nI was thrown from my seat, and when I could collect\nmyself, I found that A. V. B. had been flung across the\ncar from the place where she had been sitting to what had\noriginally been my seat ; that is to say, she had been\npitched from right to left, the collision having taken\nplace on her side.\nI think that makes it quite clear that Feda's des-\ncription of A. V. B.'s movements as having been jerky,\nautomatic and unconscious is correct. Of course I was\nthere the whole time during the accident, but, as I have\nsaid previously, A. V. B. was unconscious at first, and\nI was, as Feda states, bending over her at a later stage,\nnamely, when she recovered consciousness. When Lady\nTroubridge asks if aU these conditions occurred just\nbefore A. V. B. passed on A. V. B. says through Feda\n\f426 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nthat they did not, but that although there was a time\nbetween, she certainly links up her death with her accident.\nThis is a distinctly good point ; because although to all\nappearances A. V. B. made a good recovery from that\naccident, there can be no doubt that she really never\nrecovered from the shock, and several doctors have\ntold me that it very probably hastened her end. It is\nundoubted that the consequences of the accident accen-\ntuated her tendency to lead the sedentary life most\nfavourable to the development of the high blood-pressure\nwhich was the ultimate cause of her death.\nAs will have been noticed we did not succeed in\nobtaining from Feda the name of the month in which\nthe accident occurred ; we got M. given, which is correct\nfor the month of A. V. B.'s death, but no correct letter was\ngiven for the month of the accident. We did, however,\nobtain a correct statement regarding the fact that one\ncondition occurred at one season of the year, and the\nother condition at another season of the year : meaning\npresumably the motor accident and her death. Feda\ngives two approximate times, namely, March or April,\nand October or November ;\nalthough it must be noticed\nthat Feda actually stopped Lady Troubridge at the mention\nof October. She is very near the mark, since A. V. B.\ndied in May, while the accident occurred late in September.\nWhen, owing to a misunderstanding, Feda stops on one\noccasion at the month of July, it will have been noticed\nthat A. V. B. protests, saying :\n\" No, No,\" appearing to\nknow that this is wrong.\nAfter this reference to the month we find A. V. B.\nendeavouring, in order apparently to satisfy us, to make\nFeda show by pantomine exactly what happened, for Feda\nsays, acting the movement at the same time, that A. V. B.\nis trying to jerk her ; A. V. B. tries to jerk her violently\nit seems, since she is thrown forward nearly out of her\nseat, and we find Feda saying that this was no ordinary\nfall or slide, but that A. V. B. was pitched. And here\nwe get A. V. B. correcting Feda with regard to the\ndirection in which she was pitched, and stating that she\npitched forward, but a little to one side as well, not\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 427\nquite forward ;\nthis, in view of the fact that at the\nmoment of the accident A. V. B. was sitting forward\nin her seat with her body practically turned towards me,\nand was flung across the seat of the car, is perfectly\ncorrect.\nAfter this there comes another familiar gesture of\nA. V. B.'s ; Feda runs her fingers under the hair at the\nfront of the head, drawing in her breath as though in\npain. A. V. B. always did this when the old scars used\nto shoot, as they frequently did. She may also have\nwished to imply, correctly, that the scalp-wounds were\nincurred owing to her pitching sideways against the broken\nwindow of the car.\nAnd now we come to what I feel is one of the best\npoints in the whole description. It is this : A. V. B.\nsays through Feda that when she was jerked there was\nsomething at the side which frightened her, something\nwhich only caught her eye ;\naccording to Feda, A. V. B.'s\nown words are : \"It was like a sudden flash.\" At the\ntime of the collision I did not think that A. V. B. who,\nas I have said, was turning towards me, had seen the\napproaching motor ; I questioned her about this after-\nwards, and many were the arguments, which invariably\nended with the assertion on her part that she knew\nperfectly well that she had seen something ; she used to\nsay :\n\" I tell you I did see something, what I saw was\nlike a sudden flash.\"\nAfter getting the evidential words regarding the \" sudden\nflash,\" through Feda, I feel quite sure that I allowed a\ncertain amount of excitement to come into my voice\nwhen I said \" good !\n\" At all events I recorded in my\nnotes, as a fact against myself, that I had spoken ex-\ncitedly. Therefore, when a little further on Feda says\nthat A. V. B. laid great stress on the thing that just\ncaught her eye, we must look' on that last reference to\nthe approaching motor as non-evidential. There was,\nhowever, nothing in my excited comment of \" good \" to\ngive Feda the least clue as to the position in which I\nfound A. V. B. after the accident ; and yet Feda assumed\nthe exact position. She dropped her head on her breast\n\f428 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nand collapsed in a land of heap in the chair, remarking\nas she did so, \" she was doubled down like this.\" Through-\nout this whole description I have never seen anything\nso life-like as was the pantomime. With some of the\ngestures, particularly those connected with the stiffness\nin the neck, Lady Troubridge is just as familiar as I am,\nand she entirely agrees with me as to their startlingly\nfaithful character.\nOn June 6th, 1917, at a sitting taken by Lady Trou-\nbridge, I acting as recorder, there was another apparent\nreference to the motor accident. It ran as follows :\nF. Oh, dear ! she's trying to show Feda funny things\nthis morning, they seem different to usual. This\nmust be another place that she thinks she's been\nto, it's a funny looking place. Now, why is\nshe touching her neck ?\nU. V. T. I don't know. (Feda begins to rub the back of her\nneck and smooths the hair up at the back.)\nF. Feda doesn't know why she's touching her head.\nU. V. T. Where is she touching it 1\nF. She's going like this : (here Feda strokes her left\neye.) Oh, no ! that's not quite right. (Feda\nmakes some more gestures around her head.)\nU. V. T. What is it ?\nF. She keeps touching her head all over, and yet she\ncan't quite show Feda what she wants. (Here\nFeda begins stroking her face all over.) She\nsays, that this has more to do with Mrs. Twonnie\nthan with you, she touches her face, she touches\nit here. (Feda touches her cheek-bones and all\naround the nose.)\nM. R. H. I think I understand, perhaps.\nF. She puts up her* hand and touches that part of her\nface all round, there is some meaning in it.\nIT. V. T. Well, can she remember any place connected with it?\nF. A place on the earth plane do you mean ?\nU. V. T. Yes.\nF. She keeps stroking her face like this, it's down the\n\fLxxvin.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 429\nmiddle part more (Feda strokes her face from the\ncheek bone downwards). She says it wasn't here\nin London, she does say mysterious things this\nmorning, it's all so mysterious.\nU. V. T. Never mind, Feda, you try to tell me.\nF. (Sotto voce : Bur\u2014Bur\u2014Bur\u2014Bur. Burn\u2014Burner\n\u2014\nBearer). Oh, no ! it's not Burner. Feda thinks\nthat this was some kind of place that she's\ntrying to say. Bur, and then there's something\nmore, it's not Berrell she says, but it does begin\nwith a \" B,\" and it has something to do with\nwhy she's touching her face.\nU. V. T. I'm afraid I can't follow.\nF. No, \u00b0\nit's a funny word. Feda thinks it's got\nmore the sound of B\u2014u than B\u2014e.\nU. V. T. WeU don't try, it will come easier later on.\nF. No, Feda won't try, it might be a person and not\na place, but if it's a person it's no one very\nclose to her. Now she says that someone else\nwas brought into these conditions at that time\nwho had nothing to do with her, and now she\ngives the letter S very clearly ; and it all has\nto do with this time, and with her face, but not\nto do with you very much ; it's Mrs. Twonnie\nthat Ladye remembers, it's to do with her that\nLadye remembers it. It wasn't close here at\nall, it looks to Feda as though she's showing\nmore a country place, Feda sees more space than\nif it were London.\nIn the above extract A. V. B. appears to be returning\nto her motor accident, and to be thinking of the place\nwhere that accident occurred, since she seems to try to\ngive Feda the impression of some place that she has been\nto, and then proceeds to touch her neck. Feda makes\na rubbing gesture at the back of the neck as she did on\nDecember 30th, 1916, but in this present sitting we find\nFeda stroking her left eye and feeling her face, at one\ntime all over, and at another time indicating the cheek\nbone and around the nose, and yet again stroking her\n\f430 .Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nface all the way down. These movements are an ampli-\nfication of the movements given on December 30th, 1916 ;\nthey point to a memory of injuries other than those\nmentioned in that sitting. For although Feda does not\nseem to think that she has been quite right in stroking\nher left eye, this gesture was in reality very accurate,\nsince there was an immense amount of bruising and\ntenderness all down one side of A. V. B.'s face, the left\neye being particularly discoloured. When Lady Troubridge\nasks whether a memory has been retained of any place\nconnected with the condition Feda is describing, the reply\nis that A. V. B. says it wasn't in London. A propos\nof where it was, Feda gets as far as repeating the word\nBur\u2014 four times, and tells us that there is something which\nshould follow after Bur, in other words that she has not\ncompleted the name, also that this refers to a place, and that\nthis place which begins with B. has, according to A. V. B.,\ngot something to do with her reason for touching her face.\nA little later on Feda says that A. V. B. speaks of\nsomebody else having been brought into those conditions\nat that time, someone who had nothing to do with her,\nwith whom she gives a very clear letter S. A. V. B.\nalso gives Feda to understand that it is with me and not\nwith Lady Troubridge that all this is associated in her\nmind, she also shows Feda that the place was some\ndistance from London, and that it was a country place.\nAs we have already said, the gestures regarding the face\nwere correct, Bur. was also correct so far as it went, for\nit will be remembered (see p. 425) that when commenting on\nthe sitting of December 30th, 1916, we mentioned the fact\nthat the motor accident occurred at Burford. With\nregard to the person called S. I believe this to be the\nchauffeur who was driving our car at the time of the\naccident, whose name was Serpell. There is a little\ndoubt, perhaps, regarding this point, as Feda says that\nthis person had nothing to do with A. V. B., but we\nthink that these words were intended to convey that S.\nwas not a relation or friend, as they follow imme-\ndiately after Feda's remark concerning Bur : \"If it's\na person it's no one very close to her.\" Feda may\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 431\nhave been continuing this train of thought when she refers\nto S.\nImmediately following on the extract we have just\ndealt with came the description of a narrow lane and a\ngate, afterwards corrected to a narrow road with a gate\nacross it. This we could not place and said so. There\nthen followed the description of a place with hills, and\nwith roads running down ; hills in the distance were also\nmentioned. A. V. B. then showed herself to Feda coming\ndown the side of a hill, not coming perfectly straight down,\nbut curving round, and this, it was said, led A. V. B.\nto a place where she used to be ; the walking was said\nto be rough, and after you had descended further down\nthe hill you were said to come to a shady part, like a\nline of trees or something, near the bottom, not quite\nlike a wood, however. Feda said that A. V. B. knew\nthat part and remembered it. Next came the description\nof a house and a cottage, people were said to go up\nand down between the cottage and the house, as there\nalways used to be a little link between them. Some\nsteps and a gate were next described, and we were told\nthat if you entered the gate and turned in one direction\nyou came to a door, whereas if you turned in the opposite\ndirection you came to an open kind of place, but that\nnobody walked round there much. Concerning this\nopen kind of place, Feda suddenly asked the following\nquestion :\n\" Do you understand why she is showing Feda\nflags ?\n\" When asked what kind of flags, Feda replied :\n\" Not waving flags, not silk or cotton, Feda means stone\/'\nShe was told that we did understand this, whereupon\nshe said, \" Well, she's showing them to Feda, big flags,\nbig square ones, there were a lot of them there, and\nthere's green too, short green.\" Some further description\nwas given of which it is sufficient to say that it was all\napplicable to the same place.\nIn our opinion the place described is Malvern Wells,\nand it is quite logical that A. V. B. should link it up\nin her mind with Burford and the motor accident, since\nshe lay in a stranger's house in Burford for eleven days\nor so after the accident, but as soon as she could be\n\f432 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [PABT\nmoved was taken to The White Cottage, Malvern Wells,\nwhither we were bound when the accident occurred. We\nhave already quoted one or two descriptions of this\nhouse and its surroundings, and it will have been gathered\nfrom them that, as Feda states in the present sitting,\nthe country is very hilly. In the present sitting this\nreference to hilliness is somewhat elaborated, as A. V. B.\nshows herself walking down a hill path, which is correctly\ndescribed as curving round and as being rough under\nfoot. This path is said to take A. V. B. to the place\nwhere she used to be, presumably meaning The White\nCottage or the village of Malvern Wells ; there were\nmany such paths near our house which were suffi-\nciently easy to be negotiated by A. V. B., and by which\nshe would occasionally return home. One such path\nhad trees towards the bottom of it ; it was a favourite\nwalk of A. V. B.'s, she said it reminded her of Simla,\nand christened it the \" Simla Walk.\"\nThe reference to the house and the cottage which are\nsaid to have had people going constantly between them\nwould apply to our house and the small cottage which\nstood in the garden, and which contained the servants'\nhall and servants' double bed-room, descriptions of which\nit will be remembered were obtained at earlier sittings.\nThe gate and steps referred to in the present sitting are\ncorrectly described. We are told that if, after having\nentered this gate, we turned in one direction we would\ncome to a door, but if we turned in another direction\nwe would come to a wider place ; this is correct. The gate\nwas a front garden gate, and if you entered it and turned\nto the right you would come by a winding path to the\nfront door of the house ;\nif, on the other hand, you turned\nto the left you came to the third section of the garden,\nwhich was referred to by us when commenting on the\nsitting of October 9th, 1916. This section of the garden\nwas an open space which A. V. B. and I had turned\ninto an Italian garden. Immediately after referring to\nthis open place in the present sitting, Feda speaks of\nstone flags. Now these stone flags were a feature of\nthat Italian garden which A. V. B. would be likely to\n\fLxxvin.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 433\nremember, since we ourselves obtained them with con-\nsiderable trouble, and A. V. B. was very proud of the\neffect. The short green spoken of by Feda in this\nconnection may be the rock plants which we endeavoured\nrather unsuccessfully to grow between the flags, or her words\ncould equally well be taken to refer to grass which grew down\nto the flags on one side, or to short plants, of which there\nwere many. Feda says that A. V. B. tells her, in refer-\nence to the open place, that nobody walked round there\nmuch. This as it happens is quite true, for oddly enough\nwe seldom used the Italian garden which we had taken\nsuch trouble to create.\nOn June 13th, 1917, I took a sitting and Lady Trou-\nbridge recorded. Space forbids that we should give a\nlong extract from this sitting, but in it there occurred a\nfurther reference to the motor accident. Feda said\nsuddenly :\n\" Now, she's going back to this,\" and began\na stroking movement of the face, saying, at the same\ntime, that all this had more to do with me than with\n\" Mrs. Una.\" I, wishing to get a still clearer description,\nsaid that I did not quite understand ;\nwhereupon Feda\nsaid that it was not my face but A. V. B.'s, but that\nI knew about it. She said that this had not happened\n\" only just a little time \" before A. V. B. passed on, and\nthat A. V. B. was most anxious to get it through.\nA. V. B. then endeavoured apparently to describe, through\nFeda, the sensations caused by a violent blow on the\nhead, she spoke of a sensation of falling, a giddy feeling,\nthat made you feel as if you must fall to the ground,\nshe also impressed Feda with the feeling that everything\nwas going black, as if one were becoming unconscious as\nif, as Feda said, \" you were going down, sinking, sinking.\"\nShe then added, \" This has nothing to do with her passing\non, it was before.\" There followed a little more des-\ncription regarding the blackness, a humming noise in\nA. V. B.'s head, etc., and then came these words spoken\nby Feda :\n\" This happened a good time before she passed\non, but she says that from that time everything that\nhappened tended towards her passing on. What she's\njust described seemed like the first definite step towards\n\f434 Miss Badclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nher passing, yet she says she had an interval of time in\nbetween, when it seemed as if that condition had not\ncontributed towards her passing on.\"\nIt will be remembered, perhaps, that when the first\ndescription of the motor accident was given on December\n30th, 1916, A. V. B. said through Feda that she finked\nthe motor accident and her death together, though it\nwas clearly intimated at that sitting that there had been\nan interval of time between the two occurrences. The\nreference to this same thing in the present sitting would\ntherefore appear to be an elaboration of what was given\nregarding that point on December 30th, 1916, and rather\na good elaboration, too, since A. V. B. tells us through\nFeda in the present instance, that there was an interval\nof time between the two occurrences when it seemed as\nif that condition, i.e. the motor accident, had not con-\ntributed towards her passing on. Now we said when\nreferring to the sitting of December 30th, 1916, that\nA. V. B. had, to all appearances, made a very good\nrecovery from the accident, and there certainly was an\ninterval of time when those who knew her best thought that,\nafter all, she might be going to shake off the effects of\nthe shock.\nAfter Feda's remarks on June 13th, 1917, above referred\nto, there came some more allusions to the sudden black-\nness, etc. Then the following occurred :\nF. She says they put something over her face.\nM. R. H. What and when ?\nF. Wait a minute, she wants to give that. She felt\nsomething soft touching her face she says, and it\nfelt damp, she says, it felt damp, Feda doesn't\nthink this is important.\nM. R. H. Yes, it is.\nF. She says she didn't like it, it worried her.\nA little later on Feda described a feeling of sickness,\nlater on again, but still continuing with the description\nof things pertaining to the accident, Feda said the following\nwords :\n\" Mrs. Twonnie, she didn't at all like to think\nthat all that might happen again you know, it made much\n\flxxvih.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 435\nmore impression on her than people knew. She says\nthat always after that she had uncomfortable feelings,\nshe says that she never got quite right, but that she\ndidn't know herself how wrong things were.\"\nThe soft damp thing which appears to have worried\nA. V. B. may well have been the sponge with which\nI was bathing her face and head when she regained\nconsciousness after the accident. The feeling of sickness\ndescribed by Feda is correct, as A. V. B. suffered from\nintense sickness after the blow on her head ; it is also\nperfectly correct when Feda says that A. V. B. did not\nlike to think that all this might happen again, that\nit had made more impression on her than people\nknew. Although A. V. B. had great self-control, she was\nvery nervous after the accident. No one but a person\nlike myself who knew her intimately would have known\nhow nervous of motoring she was after our collision; I\nremember that people used to congratulate her on the\nwonderful nerve she showed.\nA. V. B. is quite right in telling us through Feda\nthat after her accident she always had \" uncomfortable\nfeelings \" ;\nwe have already described the stiffness of the\nneck, etc., left by her injuries, and that she did not\nknow herself how wrong things were Lady Troubridge\nand I can quite believe. On October 9th, 1916, when\nreferring to her condition, A. V. B. said something very\nsimilar to this through Feda, telling us that she had not\ngrasped how serious her condition was.\nWith regard to these descriptions of The White Cottage,\nMalvern Wells, the motor accident and things pertain-\ning thereto, it is interesting to notice how well sus-\ntained is the train of thought. In each of the descrip-\ntions occurring upon different dates, the original idea\nremains clearly defined, but new points, just as evidential\nas those already given, and quite as relevant to the\ntopic in hand, are introduced with each new reference.\nVery little, if any, of the old ground is gone over on the\nseveral separate occasions when these two topics are\nintroduced. Thus on October 9th and October 18th,\n2e\n\f436 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\n1916, we get the interior of the cottage described, the\nshape of the garden, and certain features of the neigh-\nbourhood. On June 6th, 1917, we do not get the interior\nof the cottage described, but we get new features of the\nneighbourhood, such as the hills, and the hill path upon\nwhich A. V. B. walked ; we get the garden of the house\nreferred to again, but not in the same way as on previous\noccasions, since new features regarding the garden are here\nintroduced. On December 30th, 1916, we obtain a\ndescription of the motor accident and symptoms accruing\ntherefrom, but on June 6th, 1917, although the motor\naccident is again returned to, we get new, though equally\nrelevant symptoms described, together with an attempt\nto give the name of the place where the accident occurred,\nthe initial of the chauffeur who was driving, and, in fact,\nseveral new points not hitherto mentioned. On June 13th,\n1917, there is a further reference to the motor accident,\nand here again new points are given, when A. V. B.\nendeavours to describe her feelings just prior to, or\nsubsequent to, unconsciousness, and would appear to refer\nto the damp sponge applied to her face, and also to her\nown nervous apprehension lest at any time another such\naccident might occur, and to her realisation that she had\nbeen able to disguise her feelings on this point.\nSection V. Memory of U. V. T.'s Photographs.\nWe now propose to deal with a few odds and ends of\nmemory which have cropped up during various sittings.\nHere is one of them.\nOn October 13th, 1916, Lady Troubridge took the sitting\nand I acted as recorder. At the time Lady Troubridge and\nI thought of going abroad on war work, and had asked\nA. V. B. whether she knew that we were going away. It\nappeared that the purporting communicator was aware of\nour plans. After a good deal of discussion on the topic,\nthe following occurred :\nF. She says you're to take a camera, }^ou'll be glad\nyou've taken it afterwards.\nU. V. T. But would it be allowed ?\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 437\nF. She says she's sure it would be allowed, but she\nsays, please take a good one. She says some-\nthing about horrible things having been taken with\na camera, not professional ones, amateur ones\n;\nthey were not taken in a room, but outside a\nroom, and there was some sort of leanness at\nthe back.\nU. V. T. Tell her : yes, they were dreadful things, I won't\nlet anyone see them.\nF. She says they were nightmares. There were clusters\nof leafies at the back. The background looks in\nhumps. She says, it is all hard lights and a\nlot of shadow, they're so awful looking. She says,\nwouldn't it have been awful if they had been a\nhead and shoulders enlarged.\nU. V. T. Does she remember where they were taken ?\nF. They were taken a little way from here, not in\nLondon. There are shrubs in London, but it\nwasn't here. She says, if you went there from\nhere you'd be going in a slightly westerly direc-\ntion. She knows the place well. She says the\npictures were taken a little away from the house,\nthey were not taken against the wall of the house,\nbut against leafies.\nTJ. V. T. Something that she did there used to frighten us.\nAsk her if she can remember what it was.\nNow, about seven months prior to A. V. B.'s death\nshe and I and Lady Troubridge visited Watergate Bay,\nnear Newquay in Cornwall ; while there Lady Troubridge\ntook some photographs, some of A. V. B. and some of\nmyself. Those taken of me were a great success, but those\ntaken of A. V. B. were quite a libel. A. V. B. disliked\nthem enormously, and knowing that Lady Troubridge\nalways pasted her photographs into albums, was rather\ndistressed that they had not been a greater success.\nShe mentioned these photographs disparagingly, not only\nto me but to one or two friends ; in fact, at the time\nshe seemed quite hurt about them, though she did not\nmention it to Lady Troubridge. Fortunately, although\n\f438 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nLady Troubridge disliked the photographs quite as much\nas A. V. B., there is a print of one of them in existence,\nand Lady Troubridge retains the negative. The print\nin our possession shows A. V. B. standing against a\nbackground of uneven rock and shrubs ; the rock formed\na sort of wall to a part of the garden. In front\nof this wall of rock, and just behind A. V. B., is a strip\nof earth, from the earth rise low shrubs to the level of\nA. V. B.'s waist, from which level to well above her\nhead is the rough, rather \" humpy \" looking rock, while\nat the top of the photograph the leaves of some rock\nplants are visible ; the site chosen for the photograph\nwas a few feet away from the house.\nThere were also some photographs of A. V. B. taken\nin a room on the same occasion ; these however were so\nbad that Lady Troubridge destroyed them at once, a\nfact known to A. V. B. The only photographs therefore\nabout which she felt any annoyance, lest they should, so to\nspeak, be handed down to posterity, were those taken\nagainst the background which we have just described, and\nwhich she mentions through Feda. These photographs\nhad been pasted into Lady Troubridge's album, a fact\nknown to A. V. B.\nIt will be noticed that Lady Troubridge asks Feda if\nA. V. B. can remember what it was she did at the\nplace where the photographs were taken, which thing\nused to frighten us. In reply to this question Feda\nlaunched into a very long and involved description,\nwhich we consider unduly lengthy for insertion in this\npaper. It was extremely intricate, and as an example\nof a successful reply finally obtained to a direct question,\nit was in itself interesting, but its only bearing on our\npresent point lies in the fact that it left us no doubt\nwhatever that Watergate Bay was the place indicated,\nand, incidentally, that the photographs taken there were\nthe subject of A. V. B.'s communication.\nSection VI. Memory of A. V. B.'s Guitar.\nThe next example we would give deals with A. V. B.'s\nfavourite musical instrument.\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 439\nOn November 15th, 1916, I took the sitting and Lady\nTroubridge recorded. It was not a good sitting, as I\nnot only asked, but pressed, too many direct questions.\nI was feeling ill, and was undoubtedly injudicious ; a fact\nwhich Feda seemed to realise.\nOne of my questions was as follows :\n\" Does she re-\nmember a musical instrument she was very fond of ?\nIn reply to this question I got a statement to the effect\nthat it was not like a piano ; which statement Feda\nelaborated by describing some instrument which suggested\nan organ. She even went so far as giving an imitation\nof air going in and out of pipes. When I asked what\nkind of music A. V. B. used to play Feda declared\nthat it sounded to her like rather grand music, \" like\na grand kind of march.\" I was quite bewildered and\nsaid so, asking whether A. V. B. thought that she\nhad played this thing herself. To which Feda replied :\n\" No, she doesn't say she did it herself, she says it is\nhard to get anything through.\" Now, this was an\nunaccountable mistake, seeing that the instrument played\nby A. V. B. was a guitar, and during a personal A. V. B.\ncontrol which occurred some time after this sitting, I\ntold A. V. B. that Feda had never succeeded in describing\nto me the instrument she played. I laughed and said :\n\" She told me that you played the organ.\" Whereupon\nA. V. B. remarked :\n\" How absurd, what kind of an organ ?\n\"\nNothing else was mentioned regarding this instrument\nby us, as we did not wish to give any clues, and I had\npractically forgotten the incident, when, on April 25th,\n1917, at a sitting at which I alone was present, acting\nas my own recorder, the following occurred :\nF. (Beginning to hum a tune) She's singing, she's singing,\nsomething pretty too, do you know, Mrs. Twonnie,\nit sounds as though she could sing. She's not\nsinging loudly, rather softly, she's telling Feda\nthat she does sing in the spirit world. Mrs.\nTwonnie, she likes singing awful much.\nM. B. H. Yes.\n\f440 Miss Badclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nF. Do you know she likes all these kind of things.\nShe likes the talking that is like singing.\nM. R. H. What do you mean by that, Feda ?\nF. Well, like people will say poetry, people that say\npoetry reaUy well, she is very interested in all\nthat. And now she's showing Feda something\nthat you can pull strings to, she's going turn,\nturn, turn. (Here Feda gives an exact imitation\nof the sound of notes picked on a guitar, imi-\ntating with her hand the plucking of strings.)\nMrs. Twonnie, she's plucking them.\nM. R. H. That's splendid, you are making the exact noise.\nF. She's making the noise, and Feda can always\nimitate what she can do. she says it does make\nyour fingers sore too, she says she might as well\ntell you that she is not trying to imitate a cornet\nor a trombone ! (Here Feda again makes the\nexact noise of notes picked on a guitar.) She\nsays, do you know, she sees them in the spirit\nworld plucking those string things and singing\nsoftly to them. She says she thinks it's getting\nto be almost a lost art on the earth plane ; where\nshe is she can do it herself and she loves it, she\nlikes also to hear other people do it, sometimes\nshe goes to listen to them in the evenings, she\nsays, and they sing lovely things. Sometimes\nthey say things while they play, it's more like a\nchant, they don't always sing them, sometimes\nthey say them. Oh ! she did like that turn,\nturn, turn, when she was on the earth plane\nmore than anything. (Here Feda again imitates\na guitar.) Mrs. Twonnie, she saj^s that when\nfirst she got over and saw this thing on which\nyou do turn, turn, turn, it made her feel most\nawfully glad, it brought back so many remem-\nbrances of her earth life to her. She says, she's\ngot one of these things standing in the corner\nof her sitting room in her spirit home, she par-\nticularly says standing, not lying down. (Here\nFeda began to murmur something about a gold\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 441\nframe with mother-of-pearl, asking me if the\ninstrument could have a gold frame ; I replied\nthat I didn't know, but that I didn't quite\nunderstand the gold, after which Feda said :)\nF. Now, Mrs. Twonnie, she's showing Feda the thing\nitself, and she's showing Feda that some part of\nit is rounded towards the bottom of that mother-\nof-pearl, she says that she has this thing leaning\nup in a corner of her room, she says there is\nonly a little bit of mother-of-pearl which is set\ninto it, and she keeps on telling Feda that this\ninstrument is rounded at one end and then goes\nin a bit, making it have a little bit of a waist.\n(Here Feda draws in the air the exact shape\nof a guitar.) She's showing Feda that there are\nsome strings which go over that mother-of-pearl.\nM. R. H. Quite right.\nF. Oh ! and now she's trying to make Feda under-\nstand that she used to screw something up, she\nis showing Feda something that looks like little\nscrews. (Here Feda gives an imitation of tuning\na stringed instrument.) She says that she used\nto turn one of those pegs, screw it up, and then\ngo :\n\" turn,\" and that then she used to screw\nup another one and go :\n\" turn,\" again. (Here\nFeda makes the sound of a lower note on the\nguitar.) She's trying to show Feda that this\ninstrument was browny coloured, but she keeps\non saying she's got a gold case for it, but Feda\ndoesn't think that the thing itself is gold, it's\nbrowny coloured, it's light brown in one place,\nand much darker in another, and it's like one\nthat she knew on the earth plane ; she's trying\nto show Feda that the part of it where you touch\nthe strings is of a lighter colour than the sides,\nand she says that she had one like this on the\nearth plane.\nM. R. H. That's right.\nF. (Whispering over and over again to herself an\ninarticulate word.) Oh ! dear, Feda can't get\n\f442 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nthis, but she's trying to say that this word has\nsomething to do with the earth plane and this\nthing that she's been describing. No, Feda can't\nget it, it's a very funny word, and it seems to\nstart with a B, Mrs. Twonnie. She used to\ntouch this instrument, that she has been des-\ncribing, properly, she touched it properly, your\nLadye, and she used to do it for people, people\nthat liked it. She says that she hadn't got any\nribbons on this instrument, she's laughing over\nthat, Mrs. Twonnie, and she says that she doesn't\nintend to have any on it either ; she says :\n\" I\nhaven't got ribbons on it \u2022\n\" funny, Mrs. Twonnie,\ndo you know she doesn't seem to like ribbons\n;\nFeda likes ribbons, lots of ribbons.\nAs we have already stated the instrument played by\nA. V. B. was a guitar ; she was an expert player, and\nused to sing Spanish folk music to the guitar. As will\nhave been noticed Feda prefaces her description of this\ninstrument by remarking that A. V. B. is singing.\nA. V. B. was considered a very fine amateur singer.\nFeda tells us that she is not singing loudly, but rather\nsoftly ; this was characteristic of A. V. B., who had a\nsmall voice which she never forced. Feda appears to\ngather that A. V. B. liked singing very much, and also\npoetry, which she most certainly did. The noise made\nby Feda to imitate the notes of a guitar was very\nrealistic.\nWe suppose that guitar playing usually does make the\nfingers sore, and that this is non-evidential ; at the same\ntime this soreness of the fingers was often complained\nof at some length by A. V. B. As in the case of\nthe riding previously dealt with, so here again we do\nnot propose to put forward any opinion with regard to\nFeda's statement that guitars are played in the next\nstate of existence ; the only evidential point of interest\nin this statement lies in the description of the music\nwhich A. V. B. tells us through Feda that she hears\nbeing played in her present state. We do not know\n\flxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 443\nwhether any of our readers are acquainted with Spanish\nMalagenas, and other forms of Spanish folk songs ; if\nthey are, they will recognise at once how very like a\nchant much of that music is. Also that some parts\nof the song are occasionally spoken.\nThis Spanish music was the only music that A. V. B.\nconsidered to be suitable for a guitar, she was intensely\ninterested in it, had learnt a good deal of it in Spain,\nand, whenever any Spanish musicians came to London,\nwould always have lessons. In fact, I think that\nA. V. B. was almost the only amateur in England who\nwas an expert exponent of the music in question. She\nwas devoted to it.\nWe find A. V. B. saying through Feda that her present\nguitar stands in a corner of her room, and emphasizing\nthe fact that it stands and does not lie down ; most\npeople's guitars stand in the corner of their room, and\nwe would not have troubled to refer to this statement had\nit not been that A. V. B. was very particular that her\nnumerous guitars should never be laid down on their\nbacks ; she said that it made them go out of tune unless\nthey were laid down on their strings, and as it was\nimpossible always to remember to do this, they were kept\nupright in different corners of the rooms.\nFeda's remarks regarding a gold frame with mother-of-\npearl, and later, a gold case, appear rather childish, and\ndo not sound to us at all as though they emanated from\nA. V. B. who disliked everything tawdry. With regard to\nthe reference to the '\"\ncornet \" and \" trombone \", this would-be\nattempt at humour jarred upon us, and certainly was in\nno way characteristic of A. V. B. to whom Feda attributes\nit. We think it was, together with the gold case, a\nlittle Feda interlude. The word which Feda whispers\ninarticulately, but which she says begins with B and\nhas something to do with a guitar and the earth plane,\nmay possibly have been an attempt at the word \" ban-\nduria \" ; the banduria is the Spanish equivalent of a\nmandoline. I used to play the mandoline, accompany-\ning A. V. B.'s guitar, but she was anxious that I\nshould learn the banduria, and got one sent to me from\n\f444 Miss Badclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nSpain ; I did not master it, however, which A. V. B. always\ndeplored.\nWe now come to the most evidential point in the\ndescription, and that occurs when A. V. B. states with\nemphasis, through Feda, that she did not have any\nribbons on her guitar, has not got any now, and does\nnot intend to have any: and Feda says that A. V. B.\nis laughing over this. Now we think it will be admitted\nthat nearly all English women, if they play the guitar at\nall, have streamers of bright-coloured ribbons from the\ninstrument. This always amused A. V. B. immensely,\nbecause she, knowing Spain, was aware of the fact that\nSpanish ladies do not usually indulge in this particular\nfoible. It was a great joke between us, that the less\nexpert the English player the more magnificent the\nribbons. A. V. B. never had ribbons on her guitars.\nSection VII. Memory of Words Peculiar to A. V. B.\nWe will now deal with two examples of what would\nappear to be a rather more subtle retention of memory\nthan those hitherto given, since it is the retention of\nmemory regarding the meaning or sense of certain words\ninvented by A. V. B. herself. We must first of all record\nsome words of mine spoken during the sitting of November\n15th, 1916, which sitting we have stated in another\nconnection, was a bad one, probably owing to the fact\nthat I pressed questions. One of my questions on that\noccasion was as follows :\n\" Ask her does she remember\na funny word she invented with Adela for people they\ndidn't like ?\n\" Feda replied, that A. V. B. would try\nto remember it, would put it in a mental note-book,\nbut that it made it extremely difficult when I asked things\npoint blank. We only mention this because it must be\nborne carefully in mind that I distinctly said that the\nword which A. V. B. had invented, was applicable to\npeople she did not like.\nOn January 17th, 1917, a sitting which I took, Lady\nTroubridge recording, I suddenly put the following\nquestion :\n\flxxvhi.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 445\n\" Does she remember the word, '\nPoon ?\n'\n;\nperhaps\nshe will laugh, but I'd like to know whether she remembers\nwhat that word meant ?\n\"\nF. Yes, she is laughing, she says that word meant a\nstate. It was a word used to express a state\nor condition.\nM. R. H. It was a word she used.\nF. Feda can't understand, but she says it was a -n ord\nthat she used to you. She says she sometimes\nthought of you in connection with it. Feda does\nhope it's not a nasty word, because she says\nshe doesn't mean that she just thinks of it\nbecause she heard you say it, she means, that she\nwould use it in connection with thinking of you.\n\" Poon, Poon,\" she calls you that. Poon isn't\na name ! But she calls you that in her mind\nnow, she thinks of you as \" Poon,\" she likes to\nthink of you as that. Feda's got just to say\nwhat she says, and she says that she hopes\nyou think of her as that too.\nM. R. H. Of course, I think of her as that. (To A. V. B.)\nThere was a word that was the opposite word\nto \" Poon.\" Do you remember ? You and I\nhad two words.\nF. Yes, she says it was the antithesis, but that she\ncan't remember the word itself. No, Feda mustn't\nsay that she can't remember, it is that she can't\nget it through.\nM. R.^H. Oh ! Ask her to try and get the first letter through.\nF. Oh dear ! Feda can't get it. But it is only a\nshort word. (Here Feda begins drawing violently\nin the air and distinctly forms an \" S.\") It's\na curly letter like a snake, look, Feda will do it\non your hand.\nM. R. H. Yes, that's right, it's an \" S.\"\nF. It isn't a long word, it's a short one, and she did\nmanage to give it quick to Feda once, but Feda\ncouldn't get it, she'll give it one day though.\nBetween this sitting of January 17th, 1917, and that of\n\f446 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nMay 2nd, 1917, with which we are about to deal, an\nattempt was made during an A. V. B. Control, to pro-\nnounce this word beginning with an \" S.\" The word\nwas not articulated, however, and A. V. B. did not get\nbeyond making the opening sibilant consonant, and when\nI asked A. V. B. what she was doing, she said she was\ntrying to get the word which was the antithesis of\n\" Poon.\" I remarked that I did not intend to give\nher the word, as I wished it kept as a test ; to which\nA. V. B. cordially agreed.\nOn May 2nd, 1917, Lady Troubridge took the sitting\nand I acted as recorder. A. V. B. had been conversing\nwith us through Feda regarding a certain person, some\nof whose ways A. V. B. rather disapproved of, when\nsuddenly, Feda broke out as follows :\nF. She says that's senseless and reasonless too.\n(Sotto voce : It's what, Ladye ? What are you\ntrying to say S\u2014ss\u2014Sss \u2014S\u2014ss.) What is the\nword, Ladye ? It's Spor\u2014Spor\u2014Spor ! She's\ntrying to get a word through that Feda can't\nmake out, Feda doesn't believe it's a proper\nword at all ; it's a very funny word, but it must\nmean something, because she is trying so hard\nto get it through, it means ... it means . . .\nOh ! Feda doesn't know. It seems to be some\nsort of more expressive word for senseless. (Sotto\nvoce : Spor . . . Spor . . . Spor . . . Spor . . .)\nWell, it's Spor, anyhow.\nU. V. T. What's the letter after \" Spor \" do you think,\nFeda ?\nF. It's a long letter. After the \" R \" comes a long\nletter.\nU. V. T. When you say a long letter, Feda, do you mean\nlong above the line, or long below the line ?\nF. It seems to Feda to be long at the bottom. (Feda\nhas for some moments been making perpendicular\nstrokes in the air.) It isn't an ordinary word\nat all ; it's a funny word that Feda has never\nheard before. Oh ! Mrs. Una, Feda sees that it\n\fLxxvin.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 447\nisn't long under the line, it's long above the line ;\nwell, there's that letter, then comes a small letter\n(sotto voce : Sporti . . . Sporbi). This little letter\nsounds something like \" I \"\n;\n(Feda pronounces\nthe I as in the word \"fish \"). And after this small\nletter there comes a curved letter, and then it\nseems to Feda there's another long letter. (Here\nFeda whispers quite inarticulate things.)\nU. V. T. Well, Feda, perhaps it will be easier if you try to\ndraw the first long letter on my hand. (Feda\nbegins drawing vigorously.)\nF. It's S ... P ... 0, Mrs. Una, then a little letter,\nand then a letter like this ;\n(she draws a \" K \"\non U. V. T.'s hand). It's a down stroke like\nthis, with a little bit like this sticking on to it ;\nSporki . . . Sporkif ?\nIT. V. T. Well, Feda, try to draw the letter which you said\nwas curved, on my hand ; the letter that you\nsaid came after the long one.\nF. That letter goes like this, Mrs. Una (here Feda\ndraws an \" S \" on U. V. T.'s hand). And then\nthere's another letter like this (here Feda draws\nan - H \").\nII. V. T. Is that the last letter of the word, Feda, or are\nthere others ?\nF. Well, Feda can't see any more, (suddenty and very\nloud) SPORKISH! SPORKISH! But that isn't\na word at all! Ladye says: \"Yes, it is,\" and\nthat it applies to people who rake things up.\n\" Not Poon,\" she says, she says it's the anti-\nthesis to \" Poon.\"\nM. E. H. At last you\"ve got it.\nF. \" Sporkish,\" she says it in such a funny way, Mrs.\nTwonnie, she says that you and she used to call\npeople that sometimes, you used to say :\n\" So-\nand-so is sporkish,\" Feda knows that it isn't\na proper English word though.\nNow with regard to these two coined words, we must\ndeal first with the word \" Poon.\" As will be re-\n\f448 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nmembered, I asked on January 17th, 1917, whether\nA. V. B. could remember what \" Poon \" meant. There\nhad been a suggestion given by me on November 15th,\n1916, as has been stated, that there did exist a word\nwhich had been invented by A. V. B. and a certain\n\" Adela,\" for people they did not like. We may, there-\nfore, justifiably conclude, that had Mrs. Leonard only\nnormal knowledge to work on, she would have retained\na memory of my words spoken on November 15th, 1916.\nand have made a mental note to the effect that there\nexisted some curious word which had been used by\nA. V. B., the meaning of which word was uncompli-\nmentary. As a matter of fact, the word which I tried to\nget on November 15th, 1916, was an uncomplimentary\nword, and there is no apparent reason why, when I\nmyself mentioned the word \" Poon \" on January 17th,\n1917, Mrs. Leonard, had her knowledge been normal,\nshould not have jumped to the conclusion that this\nstrange word \" Poon,\" was the -uncomplimentary word\nwhich I had hoped to get on November 15th, 1916.\nBut, in reply to my question of January 17th, 1917,\nwe find Feda speaking of this word \" Poon \" as a state\nor condition ;\ntelling us that A. V. B. says it was a\nword she used to me, that she sometimes thought of me\nin connection with it, that she calls me \" Poon,\" that she\nthinks of me as '\"Poon,\" that she likes to think of me as\nthat, and that she hopes I will think of her as that too.\nNow, the word \" Poon \" was A. V. B.'s own invention.\nIt was meant to express all the pleasant, indefinable\nqualities in people whom she liked. When A. V. B. said\nthat a person was a \" Poon,\" or that they were \" Poony,\"\nshe meant it as a summing up of all those attri-\nbutes which most appealed to her. I do not lay any\nclaim to the attributes with which her affection en-\ndowed me, but in spite of that she did apply this term\nto me.\nAfter getting on January 17th, 1917, a- satisfactory\ndefinition of the word \" Poon,\" I again return to my\noriginal idea of November 15th, 1916, and try to obtain\nfrom the communicator its antithesis. I do not succeed\n\fLxxvin.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 449\nin getting further on this occasion than the statement\nthat it is a short word beginning with \" S.\"\nOn May 2nd, 1917, however, as will have been seen,\nwe obtained the word \" Sporkish \" ; the application of\nthe word was perfectly correct, and its use just where\nit occurred in the conversation was entirely characteristic\nof A. V. B. \" Spork \" and \" Sporkish \" were words also\ninvented by A. V. B. Their meaning embraced all tire-\nsome and unpleasant people and their characteristics. These\nwords were semi-humorously applied by A. V. B. to all\npeople and things that bored her, irritated her, or other-\nwise incurred her disapproval. It is interesting to note\nthat the word \" Sporkish \" was finally obtained at the\nsitting of May 2nd, 1917, as a comment upon circumstances\nthat were precisely such as would have evoked it from\nA. V. B. during her earth life. Interest is added by\nthe fact, that whereas I gave on January 17th, 1917,\nthe word \" Poon \" as a noun, and asked for its opposite,\nby which it might be reasonably understood that its\nopposite was also a noun ; and whereas I implied on\nNovember 15th, 1916, also, that the word I wanted was\na noun, and whereas we were definitely endeavouring\nto obtain a noun, to wit \" Spork,\" we obtained on\nMay 2nd, 1917, most unexpectedly, the equally familiar\nand characteristic adjective \" Sporkish.\"\nSection VIII. Memory of M. R. H.'s Method of Composing.\nWe next come to what would appear to be a retention\nof memory regarding my methods of writing poetry ; these\nwere remarked upon by A. V. B. through Feda on June\n27th, 1917, at a sitting taken by me, Lady Troubridge\nacting as recorder. At a previous sitting on December\n6th, 1916, at which I was the sitter and Lady Troubridge\nrecorded, I had repeated the first verse of one of my\nown poems ; I naturally did not say that it was my\nown, merely asking A. V. B. through Feda whether she\nremembered it. It appeared that she did so, since Feda\ngave me to understand, after having said that the poem\nwas recognised, that the communicator wished to add\n\f450 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nsomething to what I had said, which was correct, as\nthere was one other verse to that particular poem. After\nthis Feda said the following words :\n\" Mrs. Twonnie, she\nsays, '\nShe makes it herself.' \" In reply to this I asked\nFeda to make her words a little less ambiguous ; I said\n:\n\"I don't quite understand, Feda; did she say, 'I make it\nmyself,' or did she say, 'She makes it herself?\" To which\nFeda replied :\n\" No, she didn't say, '\nI make it myself,'\nher words were, '\nShe makes it herself ' \"\n;\nby which I\nunderstood that A. V. B. had been trying to give Feda\nto understand that I wrote poetry.\nI am a very minor poet, still, several books of my\nverses have been published and a number of my lyrics\nset to music. Supposing therefore that my anonymity had\nnot been preserved, as we think it had, Mrs. Leonard in\nthe normal state might easily have come across some of\nmy poems and recognised in me their author ; this\npossibility should be taken into account. On June 27th,\n1917, however, there occurred a further reference to my work.\nFeda began it by giving a word here and there, such as\n\" flights,\" \" canopy,\" \" vast,\" \" space,\" etc., which words she\nstated were, according to - A. V. B., contained in some of\nmy poems. There appeared to be an effort to recall, by\nthis method, certain poems to my mind. No doubt\nthese words do appear in my poems, I should think they\nprobably did in most poems ; at all events the references\nwere not sufficiently clear to be of any interest. What\nis of interest, however, is the following :\nF. She says that you used to get a first and second\nline like in a flash, and then you used to get\nsucceeding lines, perhaps two, and then you used\nto go back and have to alter the first a bit,\nsometimes. She says it seemed as though the\nfirst and second came in a flash, and you wouldn't\nbe perfectly certain what was to follow. Although\nthe first and the second lines would suggest a\ntheme, you wouldn't know Avhat was to follow\nthem at all. You would hang on to the first line,\nit would sing in your brain as though making\n\fLxxviii.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 451\nmusic. She says it's funny, with your things\nmore than anyone else's, the first fine is always\nthe key-note to the rest.\nM. R. H. How long ago is she speaking of %\nF. Some time ago, not only just before she passed on.\nM. R. H. I only meant to ask whether it was before or after\nshe passed on.\nF. Oh ! before.\nAs A. V. B. lived with me for years, she, more than\nanyone else perhaps, was aware of my methods of work.\nIt is perfectly correct to say that my first and second\nlines come to me in a flash. It is also absolutely correct\nto say that having got hold of two lines that please me,\nI have very often not the slightest idea what I am going\nto follow them up with. Lady Troubridge, in going over\nmy papers the other day, came upon innumerable scraps\nof paper, as well as scrawls in exercise books, containing\ntwo first lines, or sometimes only one, of a poem which\nI had apparently never followed up. Feda says that\nA. V. B. says that I would hang on to the first line\n;\nthat it would \" sing in my brain as though making music.\"\nNow it is usually impossible for me to conceive a line\nof original poetry without singing it mentally, so to speak ;\nin other words, my lines always suggest to me a com-\nplementary tune. It is, and always has been my habit\nto write my poems at the piano, composing words and\nmusic simultaneously. No one was as familiar with this\nhabit as A. V. B., as she was also with the fact that,\nhaving got my two first lines, I would go to the piano,\nplaying and at the same time singing them over and over\nagain, in what must have been a most tiresome manner,\nwhile waiting for further inspiration. Since, needless to\nsay, I am not in the habit of doing this in public, it is\ndifficult to see how knowledge of my methods of work can\nhave reached the medium normally.\nSection IX. Memory of Swimming and Bathing.\nWe will next refer to memory shown regarding the\nonly form of sport much loved and at one time largely\n2f\n\f452 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nindulged in by A. V. B., namely, that of bathing and\nswimming. There are, in all, six sittings in which\nA. V. B. has mentioned bathing and swimming through\nFeda. The first reference occurred on October 13th,\n1916, during the description of Watergate Bay (see p. 437).\nMention was made at that sitting of A. V. B.'s having\nbathed at Watergate Bay. The words are as follows :\n\" Oh ! There is water near there, she's showing Feda\nsplashing, blowing, ducking her head, spreading out her\narms. (Here Feda gives an illustration of swimming.)\nThe second reference occurred on October 20th, 1916,\nand was given in the following words :\n\" She wanted you to know that she has got a private\nbathing pool in her own garden, it's perfectly safe, and\nclean, and clear, no rushes, she thoroughly enjoys it.\"\nThe third reference occurred on October 25th, 1916,\nand was to this effect :\n\" Since she's gone over she's been swimming, and doing\nall sorts of things.\"\nThe fourth reference occurred on December 6th, 1916,\nand was as follows :\n\" She likes bathing better than riding.\"\nThe fifth reference occurred on January 24th, 1917, when\nFeda said :\n\" Now she says she supposes you will be surprised to\nhear that she was bathing this morning, because it's so\ncold and wretched here on the earth plane.\"\nThe sixth and hitherto the last reference occurred, on\nMarch 9th, 1917, and was given by Feda in A. V. B.'s\nown words, which followed on a description of A. V. B.'s\nsupposed pursuits in her present state :\n\" Then I bathe ;\nyou know, don't you, that I always\nloved that, I simply revel in that part of it.\"\nWe have already said that A. V. B. loved swimming\nand bathing, and that it was her only form of sport.\n\flxxvhi.] Evidence of Memory retained by Communicator. 453\nShe loved it more intensely than most people clo. To\ngive an idea of how keen she used to be, she once gave\nherself an attack of rheumatic fever by insisting, against\nall advice, on bathing in the Lake of Como in the icy water\nof early spring. Latterly, however, owing to her failing\nhealth, she was almost entirely debarred from bathing. She\nbathed on one occasion only at Watergate Bay. In all the\nyears I knew her she only swam about four times at the\nBath Club, of which she was a member ; but then so am\nI, who cannot swim a stroke. I think I am safe in saying\nthat latterly, at all events, few people realised what a fine\nswimmer A. V. B. was, but if we should accept the spirit\nhypothesis, I cannot conceive of anything in the next state\nwhich would fill A. V. B. with a greater joy than finding\nherself able once again to indulge in one of her greatest\npleasures.\nOn the other hand, supposing \/ purported to com-\nmunicate after my death, and mentioned through a\nmedium no less than six times the fact that I had\nbathed, and that I not only had a private bathing pool,\nbut that I was enjoying the use of it, it would certainly\nlead anyone who knew me well to doubt seriously the\nidentity of the communicator, as I dislike bathing quite\nas cordially as it dislikes me.\nAnd this we think is the last instance of memory,\ngiven through Feda, which it would seem necessary to\ninclude in this paper.\n\f454 Miss Radclyffe-Hcdl and Lady Troubridge. [part\nCHAPTER III.\nApparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events.\nSection I. Actions and Conversations.\nWe will next deal with what would appear to be a\nknowledge of contemporary events, shown by a dis-\ncarnate intelligence retaining an interest in the mundane\naffairs of friends.\nAnd here we find ourselves immediately confronted by\na difficulty, since two or three of the best examples\nof this type of evidence that we have received are of so\nprivate a nature that they cannot be included in this\npaper. For instance, we had on one occasion an\ninteresting example of this kind of knowledge, when the\nmental attitude of a certain person, and the situation\nthat had resulted therefrom, appeared to have been\nthoroughly grasped by the communicator. Limitations\npertaining to my own position had also been noted and\ntaken into account. The case was stated more clearly\nthan \/ could have stated it in so few words ; in fact,\nat the time I had not formed any very definite judgment,\nbeing rather bewildered. I have now no doubt, however,\nthat the analysis given was correct. Quite recently we\nhave obtained references to another person, one who was\nfar from England at the time of the sitting. This person\nwas described in an unmistakable manner, together with\nfacts that we did not know ;\nnamely, that there had\nbeen, and was, a state of mental anxiety, of scheming and\nplanning to effect some change, regarding which the\nway was not clear. This change it was said would be\nof assistance to someone else, and one of us was warned\nthat she might hear something in this connection, and\n\flxxviii.] Apparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events. 455\ntold that that was why this had been given ; in order\nthat if she did hear she should not be worried, as in\nsome ways the results would be for the best. We also\nobtained a description of certain actions performed by\nthis person in the course of everyday life, and some details\nregarding work, with a statement that A. V. B. was trying\nto help.\nNow neither of us had the slightest idea at the time\nof that sitting that this person was contemplating any\nchange, since no mention of it had ever been made in\nletters received from them. But two days after that\nsitting one of us did receive unexpected news regarding\nthe person in question, the very news for which, it would\nappear, we were being prepared by A. V. B., since it\ntranspired later that the news received was a direct con-\nsequence of the mental processes accurately described by\nher through Fecla. We had ample opportunity later on\nof proving that all her statements had been correct, even\nto the little details given regarding certain actions ; and\nhad the desired plans been able to be carried out in\naccordance with the wishes of the person concerned, there\nis no doubt that the results would have been of value\nand of great help to someone else. Even in spite of\nthe fact that the plans in question were not carried out,\nevents did prove beneficial, as A. V. B. had foretold. This\nwe fear is but a bald statement of what was an interesting\nincident, and it seems more than a pity that the\nextract cannot be given and annotated in full, instead\nof the statement resting, as it must do, on our word\nalone. It is admissible to say, however, that considering\nall the circumstances, and supposing that we admit of\nan A. V. B. who still retains memory, and through that\na kindly interest in mundane affairs, there is nothing\nfar-fetched in the idea that she should have endeavoured\nto get into touch with the person in question, with a\nview to helping, if possible, as she stated through Feda\nthat she had done.\nOn May 2nd, 1917, a sitting was taken by Lady Trou-\nbridge, I acting as recorder, and in this case it is a\nmatter of infinite regret to us, that, owing to the diffi-\n\f456 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nculty of sufficiently disguising the circumstances discussed,\nit is impossible for us to do more than allude to this\nsitting in general terms ;\nthis, however, must be done,\nas the sitting in question was, as far as our experience\ngoes, almost unique of its kind.\nIn this sitting no attempt was apparently made to\nfurnish evidential matter for subsequent verification ; the\nsitting opened immediately with the introduction by A. V. B.\nof a topic which was practically sustained throughout the en-\ntire trance, which lasted one hour and three-quarters. A. V. B.\nbegan by referring through Feda to certain circumstances\nthat had troubled Lady Troubridge some two or three\nweeks prior to the sitting. These circumstances were\nsummed up with perfect accuracy, and allusions followed\nwhich were extremely relevant to persons connected\nwith these circumstances, and to Lady Troubridge's mental\nattitude. Enough was said by A. V. B., through Feda,\nto make it appear that she had for some time past not\nonly accurately sensed my mental condition and that\nof Lady Troubridge, but that she had apparently, at all\nevents in Lady Troubridge's case, gathered the substance\nof a conversation held privately by Lady Troubridge with\na third person, whose mental attitude and motives had\nalso apparently been grasped ; the fact of this con-\nversation having been held was unknown to me at\nthe time of the sitting. The train of thought suggested\nby the allusion to the said person led to the description\nof a fourth person, who was correctly stated to be con-\nnected with myself ; the transition was affected with perfect\nnaturalness in the following words :\n\" Oh ! while speaking\nof this, she says, by the way, there is someone who is\nequaUy to do with Mrs. Twonnie who has very much the\nsame gift.\" The thread was then maintained throughout\na description of this person connected with me, and a\nvery clear and eminently characteristic statement of\nA. V. B.'s views upon the subject under discussion was\ngiven. This we are afraid is all that we can say re-\ngarding this sitting. What struck us particularly was\nthat the coherence and continuity with which a natural\ndiscourse based upon one general topic was sustained in\n\flxxvhi.] Apparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events. 457\nthis sitting exceeded any example of that nature which\nwe had hitherto met with ;\nalthough no names were given\nby the communicator, it was quite impossible in any\ninstance to mistake the identity of the people to whom\nreference was made.\nSection II. A Flash of Colour.\nWe will now turn to sittings with which we can deal\nmore freely, and begin by giving a very slight extract\nfrom the sitting of October 9th, 1916. This was a very\nearly sitting, and I was curious to know whether A. V. B.\nlaid any claim to be able to see my physical surroundings\n;\nI therefore put the following question :\nM. R. H. Can you see me in my flat ?\nF. Not always, in good physical conditions she can,\nas at a Materialising Seance where the Medium\ngives power ; when you are extra strong and\nwell, and the weather dry, she can see you. She\nsays, one night she saw something blue near the\nbed and said :\n\" That's a flash of colour, I'll\nremember and tell her that.\"\nNow this is only a little incident, but one not entirely\ndevoid of interest. My bedroom contains nothing blue.\nThere are one or two bits of Italian woodwork painted\nrather a dark sort of duck's-egg colour, but this is the nearest\napproach to blue anywhere in the room, and these pieces\nof Italian wood-work are not near the bed. I have in\nmy possession, however, a dressing-gown of a very bright\npale blue. I seldom wear it, in fact it had been\nput away for months, but had been taken out about a\nweek prior to this sitting, to replace another gown that\nhad gone to the cleaners ; and it so happened that I had\nbeen leaving this bright blue dressing-gown on one or\ntwo occasions just then hanging over a chair at the foot\nof my bed. Nothing else of a blue colour had been near\nmy bed.\nSection III. A Diagram.\nAnother slight indication of knowledge of contemporary\n\f458 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [pabt\nevents was received by us on October 20th, 1916, at a\nsitting taken by Lady Troubridge, I acting as recorder.\nFeda had just described a paper which we thought we\nrecognised, when she switched off to quite another paper\nwhich she described in the following words :\nF. One day she was doing something with you, that\nalso had to do with a paper. It was very funny ;\nthere was something from A to B, and strokes\nin between. A to B and B to C, and lines\nfrom one to the other. It was not the same\npaper as she spoke of before, it was another one,,\nit was like this : (here Feda indicates with her\nfinger in the air the letters and connecting lines).\nU. V. T. She must have looked over my shoulder.\nF. She thought it was very perplexing, she didn't\nunderstand it herself, and she didn't think you\ndid, she says she thought :\n\" Oh ! poor Una, she'll\nnever be able to understand it.\"\nA few days prior to this sitting Lady Troubridge, when\nalone in her bedroom, had been puzzling over the diagrams\nin Dr. Morton Prince's book, The Dissociation of a\nPersonality. If page 465 of the said book be turned up,\nit will be seen how applicable are Feda's words to the\ndiagram on that page. This was the only book containing\nsuch diagrams that Lady Troubridge had then read\nsince the beginning of her sittings with Mrs. Leonard,\nor, in fact, for many years past. Why, however, did\nFeda call it a paper instead of the page of a book ?\nIt is perhaps just possible that she got a mental picture\nof that one page only, as detached from its context.\nSection IV. U. V. T.'s House and circumstances\nconnected with it.\nOn December 6th, 1916, a description, decidedly good\non the whole, was given of the interior of my flat, but\nwe omit it in order not to add to the length of the\npaper, and we will proceed to a more sustained effort to\ndemonstrate knowledge of contemporary events and\n\flxxviii.] Apparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events. 459\nconditions, beginning with a rather good description of\na room.\nOn December 30th, 1916, Lady Troubridge took a sitting\nand I acted as recorder, when the following occurred :\nF. She's been to you since Feda saw you last, not at\nMrs. Twonnie's, somewhere else ; she would have\nbeen glad to speak to you but she couldn't\nsucceed, she did try. She's showing Feda a\nsquare room, it's a sitting room, not very large,\nthe walls are light, and there are pictures on\nthem, but not heavy ones ; Feda can't see the\ndetails very well but they seem to be in light\ncolours and in light frames. The frames are\nabout the -width of your two fingers, and\nthey are flat, not rounded. The furniture in\nthat room is not heavy, there are no big, fat\nchairs, like the one you are sitting in (here\nFeda points to a heavily upholstered armchair),\nthe chairs are mostly like the one Mrs. Twonnie\nis sitting in. (I was sitting in a small wooden\nchair with arms.) Feda sees something on the\nfloor that is not quite light, but has something\nin it that shows up light, the floor looks to\nFeda a fawny, lighty brown. Feda doesn't know\nwhat it is, but as you look to where the floor\ngoes off to the wall it's darker where it meets\nthe wall.\nU. V. T. Yes, that's right, Feda.\nF. It feels to Feda like a pretty, nice room. Oh !\nshe says there's a picture of an outside place,\nof an exterior ;\nin this picture there is something\nslightly arched half-way up the picture, it's light\nunderneath the arch, and there's a dark ridge,\nit's not in a wide frame, and there's white all\nround outside of the picture, then comes the frame\nand the picture is in the centre of the white.\nU. V. T. I can't remember, I haven't looked very carefully.\nF. She says there is something in the room covered\n\f460 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nwith a square of a bluey-green colour, it's a\nsmooth stuff, not painted.\nAre you sure that there is nothing on the bluey-\ngreen ?\nNo, Feda can't see that there is. She says, that\nthere is something in the room that has got a\nbird on it, it's either drawn or worked, it seems\nto be in a fumi}?- kind of place to Feda, you\nmight not notice it at first, look carefully, you\nmay laugh when you find it.\nNow, this description is remarkably applicable to the\ndrawing-room of a furnished house in which Lady Trou-\nbridge was living at the time of the sitting. It was\na house belonging to Colonel B. (the initial is altered),\nwhich had been taken furnished by Lady Troubridge\nsince A. V. B.'s death. This room was not very large\n;\nalthough we have never actually measured the dimen-\nsions, it certainly, judging by appearances, gave the\nimpression of being approximately square ; the walls\nwere panelled in cream, and the only pictures on the\nwalls were lightly coloured Japanese prints. These\nprints were framed in light fumed oak, and the Avidth\nof the frames measured approximately two fingers, as\nstated by Feda. These frames were not rounded. In-\nside the frames was a fairly wide white mount in\nevery instance. The furniture in this room was rather\nstrikingly light in character, there was no Chesterfield,\nor heavily upholstered armchair of any land, there were\nseveral small chairs very similar to the one on which I\nwas sitting while taking notes. Two armchairs and a\nsettee there certainly were in the room in question, but\nthey were composed of light wooden frames and cane\nwith cushions. The carpet of this room is accurately\ndescribed by Feda when she says that the floor looks\n\" a fawny lighty brown.\" She appears, however, to get\nrather involved in her description of the carpet ; first she\nsays :\n\" The floor in not quite light, but has something\nin it that shows up light,\" immediately after this she\nstates that \" the floor looks to Feda a fawny lighty\nU. V. T.\n\flxxvih.] Apparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events. 461\nbrown,\" which latter statement, as we have already said,\nis correct ; the carpet was a plain fawn all over, but we\nthink that Feda may have been bewildered by the con-\ntrast between the carpet and the darker floor covering\nsurrounding it when she speaks of the floor having some-\nthing in it that shows up light, as she is perfectly right\nwhen she says : \"As you look to where the floor goes\noff to the wall, it's darker where it meets the wall.\"\nBetween the carpet and the wall of that room there was\na fairly deep margin of black linoleum.\nThe allusion to one particular picture, in which we\nare told there is something slightly arched half-way up,\nappears to refer to one of the Japanese prints. In this\nprint was shown a semi-arched tree trunk, upon which\nsat a bird. The tree trunk came, roughly speaking, about\nhalf-way up the picture, and that, together with the bird,\nformed the sole subject of this print. The background,\nwhich was of a light fawn colour, showed beneath the\narch of the tree trunk, thereby throwing the latter into\ndistinct relief. None of the other prints in the room\nresembled this in the least in design. Had Feda con-\ntented herself with saying that this was the picture of\n\" an outside place \" it would have been to the good,\nbut she added the word \" exterior,\" which is suggestive\nof something architectural. Feda, however, is fond of\nlong words, cuUed from her various sitters, and her\nknowledge of English does not always permit of her using\nthem correctly.\nThe thing in the room which is said to be covered with\na square of bluey-green smooth stuff is, we think, a\nsmall card table, which had a folding top in two pieces.\nLady Troubridge was in the habit of opening only one\nof these folds, thereby exposing to view a square of\ngreen baize. This baize had a very smooth surface.\nThe baize on this particular table was not of that mossy-\ngreen that one usuaUy sees, it was decidedly blue-green\nin tint. The only bird other than those in the Japanese\nprints, which we could discover, was one of several on\nsome cretonne, yet Feda's description suggests rather an\namusing and unexpected bird. At a later sitting, however,\n\f462 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nshe says that A. V. B. says that this bird was on the\ncretonne. A little later on in the present sitting the\ntopic of Lady Troubridge's house recurs in the following\nwords :\nF. Mrs. Una, she says, she doesn't feel settled in that\nplace where you are now.\nU. V. T. How settled ?\nF. She says, when she's been there to see you, she\nfeels as though it were not going to be yours\nmuch longer ; she says there's an agitated vibra-\ntion which makes her feel that you are only\ngoing to be there for a while, she wishes she\ncould make it yours.\nU. V. T. I wish she could.\nF. She wonders if she could be permitted to help.\nShe says : \"It wouldn't hurt anybody if that place\nwere your own,\" in fact, it would be doing some-\nbody a good turn she thinks, she says she wishes\nthe vibrations there could be made yours, she's\ngoing to see what she can do about it, and she\nsays you must think her extra clever if she\nsucceeds. It seems to Feda that she connects\nyour place with someone at a distance, that it\nbelongs to them more than to you. She says\nthat everything in it seems to suit you exactly,\nand yet that she has a feeling that you should\nnot get too fond of it because it isn't yours.\nAfter this Feda went on to say that \" Ladye \" said\nthat \"Mrs. Una\" got very fond of certain things and\nhated leaving them, etc., and that that peculiarity was\nmore developed in her than in most people, or words\nto that effect. This statement Lady Troubridge con-\nsiders incorrect in the general way in which it was given,\nthough applicable to her in the isolated instance of this\nparticular house.\nAt the time of this sitting, although the house in\nquestion had only been taken furnished on a short\nagreement, Lady Troubridge had no idea that anything\nwas about to occur which would lead to an unexpected\n\flxxviii.] Apparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events. 463\ntermination of her tenancy ;\nquite the contrary, for she\nhad definitely been told by Mrs. B. that she would be\nable to renew her agreement if she so desired, and in\nall probability to keep the house on until the end of\nthe War. Although, therefore, we were struck with the\ndescription of the room, and also with the remark that\nthe owner of the house was a long way away (we\nunderstood Colonel B. to be in France at the time,\nalthough we learnt afterwards that he had just returned\nto Ireland), we did not understand why A. V. B. should\nfeel that there were any particularly unsettled conditions\npertaining to the house. We were soon to find, however,\nthat A. V. B. was justified in her prognostications,\nfor only two days after this sitting of December 30th,\n1916, Lady Troubridge received a letter from Mrs. B.\nmaking the unusual suggestion that she should cancel her\npresent agreement, and allow Colonel B. and his wife\nto take immediate re-possession. From this letter it\nappeared pretty clear that it would be difficult for Lady\nTroubridge to renew her agreement under any circum-\nstances. The letter was written from Ireland, and a\ncurious point is, that this letter was dated Saturday,\nDecember 30th, 1916, and had therefore actually been\nwritten on the very day of the sitting.\nSection V. U. V. T.'s Dining-room and the Work\ndone there.\nThe last reference to the house which we propose to\nquote occurred on January 31st, 1917. I alone was present\nat the sitting, acting as my own recorder. As sometimes\nhappens when I am taking my own notes, I had not\ntime to consider carefully the descriptions which were\nbeing given, and on this occasion, as will be seen, I denied\nand contradicted some of the points which afterwards\nturned out to be correct.\nHere is the extract :\nF. She says something about a room at the back of\na house. A room that she sometimes goes into\nin the early part of the evening ; it's at the\n\f464 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [paet\nback of the house on the ground floor, and it\nopens\u2014wait a minute, Feda can't get this\u2014it's\nas though a window opened in that room low\ndown, a window from which you can see something\ngreen now.\nM. R. H. I don't understand that\u2014I'm not sure there's not\nsome muddle about the window.\nF. Wait a minute\u2014Feda sees better now what she\nmeans. That room opens with two doors.\nM. R. H. That may be correct.\nF. Feda doesn't quite understand this, but she says that\nthe two doors meet. (To A. V. B.) What do\nyou mean ? She is showing Feda that if you\nAvalk through those two doors you get into\nanother room, not into the hall.\nM. R. H. That's right.\nF. She says that this back room is furnished in a\ndifferent style from the room at the front part,\nand she says that if you liked you could make\none big room of it, but that you have it as\nit is because the back room is used for a different\npurpose from the front one. You've got a larger\ntable hi one room than the other.\nM. R. H. In which room do you mean ?\nF. The table seems to Feda to be in the back room\u2014\n\u2022\nit's rather a large table. You've got a table in\nthe front room too, but it's not so large, it's a\nsmaller one altogether, and it's in a different\nposition to the table in the back room. One\npart of the table in the back room comes pretty\nnear the fire, so that when any one is sitting on\nthat side of it, and she goes to get close to them,\nshe can feel the fire.\nM. R. H. How can she see so well ?\nF. She can't always, but sometimes she can ; she says :\n\" I often try to get into physical touch, but I\ndon't always manage to do it.\" She says some-\ntimes, when she goes there, all she feels is\nthat you are there, but that one evening, she's\nnot quite sure which, she went there to be near\n\flxsviii.] Apparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events. 465\nyou, and to her great surprise, she found that\nshe could see the room physically.\nM. R. H. (To A. V. B.) I'm so glad you could.\nF. She says when a thing like that does happen she\nmakes up her mind to tell you about it here.\nShe supposes that you were surprised at her being\nable to see Mrs Una's room so plainly ?\nM. R. H. Yes, it was most interesting.\nF. Do you understand it when she says that this\nroom of yours is a heavier type of room than\nthat one of Mrs Una's which she described before ?\nM. R. H. Ask her where she thinks this room that she has\njust described is.\nF. She's not very clear what you mean by that, but\nshe thinks it's your room\n\u2014\nyes, she does. She\nthinks it appears to be your room at present\n\u2014\nit's only lately that she has seen it. Mrs.\nTwonnie, have you anything like fur in that\nroom ?\nM. R. H. No.\nF. Something with long stuff like fur ?\nM. R. H. No, not if you're describing the room I mean.\nF. It's something she has sensed\u2014she hasn't seen it\nphysically, and it doesn't seem to Feda to be\nin a conspicuous position. Now she's trying to\ngive Feda an impression of it, trying to make\nFeda feel it, and it feels to Feda too long and\nstiff to be fur, and it doesn't feel like a thing\nthat you would keep in a room, to Feda. You\ncan pull the stuff out, like hair, only it feels\ncoarser and thicker than hair. It's not very\nlarge, it's about so\u2014(Here Feda indicates a length\nof about two feet). Oh ! now she says she thinks\nyou will laugh when you do see it. Mrs. Twonnie,\nthat window was not right, the way Feda saw it\nbefore ; she seems to be trying to show Feda\nthat it bulges out a bit, and yet that the window\nsort of sinks a bit. (Here Feda indicates a\ncurve with her hand.) (To A. V. B.) What are\nyou showing ? She's showing Feda that the\n\f466 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nfurniture looks rather dark in that room ; there\ndon't seem to be any light-coloured stuffs, not\ncreamy with roses on them, like Feda sees in\nso many rooms. And some of the chairs are\nof dark Avood, and she's showing Feda that\nthey've got straight backs. She says that they\nare polished, but not highly ;\nthey haven't got\nthat very bright varnished look. Now she's show-\ning Feda the fireplace. Look, Mrs. Twonnie,\nsupposing the fireplace in that room to be there\n(here Feda indicates a wall in Mrs. Leonard's\nsitting-room), well, there's a rather low seat\n\u2014\nit's not a chair\u2014it's like a seat of some kind,\nit's about so long (here Feda stretches out her\narms to their full width and manages to indicate\nabout five feet). Now supposing the fireplace\nwere there (pointing), this seat would be against\nanother wall along the side of the fireplace.\nFeda went on to describe some other points in the\nroom, difficult to follow and apparently not correct.\nShe also described rather well a bedroom in the house,\nbut we will spare the reader these details. At a certain\npoint M. R. H. asked the following question :\nM. R. H. Does she [A. V. B.] know whose house I'm living\nin, or has she muddled it up with places to which\nI go ?\nF. She looks puzzled. She says : \" Yes, I do know,\nbut I don't think I can say it. She feels you\nin different places, but she happens to have been\nin this place lately, and she says you've been\nin a room at the back, and she thinks also in\nthat bedroom, but she's not perfectly sure. You\nsee, Mrs. Twonnie, she's not always able to get\nthings through very soon after she has seen them ;\nsometimes she has to wait quite a long time\nand to give them long after she wants to. She's\nnot perfectly sure about the bedroom, but she's\nquite, quite sure about the other room.\n\flxxviii.] Apparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events. 467\nM. R. H. What does she think I do in that room ?'\nF. Well, she says you have something to eat there.\nOh ! it seems to be a mixture, because some-\ntimes you do some work there. Sometimes the\nwork seems to be connected in a way with her,\nand that helps her to sense the room. She says\nwhen you \"re there it's a kind of general post\nsometimes. What does she mean ? She says it\nsometimes looks like a sorting\u2014sorting depart-\nment, she says\u2014she sees some sorting going on ;\nshe says she hears this sort of thing :\n\" Put that\nthere, and that there ; that belongs to so-and-so ;\nnow you've got them mixed up. Oh dear !\nI've put that Avith the other one.\" She says\nsometimes she feels as if it were a serious affair\nof State, but she says she likes to feel it's that.\nIs she making fun ? She says it's like an Intelli-\ngence Department, collecting and cataloguing.\nSometimes she sees a strange person there, Feda\nthinks she's teasing, but she says that when that\nstrange person comes she sees wild excitement,\ngetting things in order, and there's a good deal\nof discussion too, and a land of re-shuffling.\nShe says she's glad to see that you have got\nsomeone to do the laborious part of the work\ninstead of you and Mrs. Una doing it. (Sotto\nvoce : Papers, papers, papers.) She's showing\nFeda papers, not letters, they seem to be held\ntogether with something ;\nthey look like tins :\n(here Feda gives an exact indication of the\nsize of the quarto sheets used by M. R. H. and\nU. V. T. in typing). Now she says they're some-\ntimes held together, but sometimes they're any-\nthing but held together. She says she thoroughly\nenjoys it, but she says you must forgive her if\nshe sees the humorous side. She says if she\nsmiles sometimes, you mustn't mind. She feels\nthat she ought not to smile, because it is such a\nlabour of love. She says she doesn't think that\nstranger always understands what it means. She\n2 a\n\f4 (is Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nsays :\n\" Does that strange person think you are\nwriting a detective story ?\n\"\nWhy should she ?\nOh ! she just wondered. She says it seems to her\nit must read so strangely. She says she senses\nsometimes that that person thinks and says so,\nbut she says it doesn't matter.\nAs will have been seen by the extract, the descriptions\nobtained here are rather complicated ; we will do our\nbest, however, to annotate them.\nThe first reference is to the back room of a house,\nthis room is said to be on the ground floor, and A. V. B.\nis said to go there sometimes in the early part of the\nevening. Now, there can be little doubt, in our opinion,\nthat the description that follows is intended to apply\nto the dining-room in Lady Troubridge's house, in which\napartment we were at the time of this sitting in the habit\nof doing the recording of our Psychical Research work :\nwe usually worked there from 3 until 6.30 p.m. and\noften later. This room is at the back of the house, and\non the ground floor. Feda begins by describing a window,\nwhich she says opens low down, from which can be seen\nsomething green, but she. has apparently seen wrong,\nor misunderstood the communicator, as she goes on to\nsay: ''Wait a minute, Feda sees better now what she\nmeans, that room opens with two doors,\" and tells us\nthat the two doors meet, and that if you walk through\nthem you get into another room. This is perfectly correct\n;\nthe dining-room in that house was separated from the drawing-\nroom by double doors opening in the centre. What the green\nthing is that Feda sees it is impossible to say : had the window\nof the dining-room been meant, this statement regarding\ngreen would be correct, as the window looked on to the\ngarden, where there were green tubs and green woodwork ;\nas it is, we can only say that there were some green\ncushions and a card table covered with bluey-green baize\nin the communicating drawing-room.\nW7\nhen Feda says that the back room is furnished\ndifferently from the front one she is perfectly correct,\nM. R. H.\n\flxxviii.] Apparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events. 469\nand yet it is also quite pertinent when she says that if\none liked one could use the two rooms as one big room,\nbut that ive had it as we did. because that back room was\nused for a different purpose from the front one. When\nLady Troubridge took the house there was no bolt or\nother means of closing the communicating doors, the two\nrooms, though furnished and coloured quite separately, having\napparently always been used as one ; but on account\nof our work Lady Troubridge had fastenings put to the\ndoors, and we kept the rooms separate. Feda is correct\nin saying that there is a larger table in one room\nthan the other, especially as she defines clearly that the\nlarger table is in the back room ; a big, round dining-\ntable stood in the back room, and an altogether smaller\ntable in the front room. We had, ourselves, put the\nsmaller table in the front room in order to have meals\nthere, owing to the dining-room being used for work ;\nit is perfectly true that a part of the table in the back\nroom came very near to the fire-\u2014we know this to our\ncost, as we later received a claim for damage to the\ntable caused by the heat.\nThis back room, although not very heavy in type,\nwas certainly more so than the front room, having in\nit among other things, and in addition to the large table, a\nlong, rather heavy oak settee, and several large oil paintings\nin very heavy frames on the walls. A. V. B. seems to have\nderived the impression that the room in question was my room,\nor appeared to be so at the time of this sitting, adding that\nit was only lately that she had seen it. This, we think,\nis quite understandable ; I was, at the time of the sitting,\nstaying with a relation, in whose house there was no\nroom available for my work ;\nLady Troubridge therefore had\nplaced her dining-room entirely at my disposal, and all\nour work was done in that room.\nWe cannot imagine what is meant by the mysterious\nthing that appears to be something like fur and yet\nwhich seems too long and stiff to be fur. Feda says\nthat it is something like hair, only coarser and thicker,\nand apparently A. V. B. thinks that\" I will laugh when\nI see it. A wire-haired terrier, which I then possessed,\n\f470 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nand which had a very shaggy, long coat, used often to\nlie in that room while we worked ;\nhe is the nearest\napproach to the article described that we can think of !\nThe final description of the window in that room is\nrather vague. The window in the dining-room was an\nordinary sash window, but on either side of it the wall\nwas curved outwards, forming two semi-circles, in the\ncentre of which was set the window. The window,\nhowever, not being in itself bowed or curved, may have\ngiven Feda the impression which she tries to express in\nthe words, \" the window sort of sinks a bit.\" The\nfurniture in that room was dark, and, as stated by Feda,\nthere were no light-coloured stuffs. The chairs were of\ndark wood, had straight backs, and were not highly\npolished. The reference to the fireplace with the seat,\nabout five feet long, which is said to be \" against another\nwall\u2014along the side of the fireplace,\" is good.\nA. V. B. appears to be so sure about the back room\nat that house, that I ask her what she thinks I do there,\nand the reply is interesting. First of all she tells us\nthrough Feda that I seem to have something to eat\nthere, but that it seems to be a mixture, because some-\ntimes I do work there which seems to be connected\nin a way with her. Now this is absolutely accurate,\nsince although that room, as has already been stated,\nwas given over to me for work, we did upon several\noccasions have a meal there, when we asked a few friends\nto the house in order to discuss Psychical Research ;\non one occasion Miss Isabel Newton, the Secretary of the\nSociety for Psychical Research, was among those friends.\nThe description given by A. V. B. through Feda of what\nshe would appear to have overheard or sensed when I\nwas working there is rather amusingly accurate.\nThe stranger, whose arrival occasionally causes wild\nexcitement about getting things in order, etc., is no doubt\nthe typist, as A. V. B. expresses pleasure that we now\nhave someone to do the laborious part of the work instead\nof undertaking it ourselves. At the beginning of our\nstudies we did not employ a typist, Lady Troubridge\ndoing all that part of the business single-handed ;\nit was\n\flxxviii.] Apparent Knowledge, of Contemporary Events. 471\nonly a short time prior to this sitting that we had engaged\na typist. This typist was rather a supercilious young\nperson, and A. V. B. is correct when she says that this\nperson not only thinks that the work is strange, but\nthat she sometimes says so. From our typist's occasional\nremarks we gathered that her frame of mind was decidedly\nsceptical. There is nothing evidential in Feda's indicating\nsheets of paper of a quarto size, as Mrs. Leonard cannot\nhave failed to notice that our notes are always made\non quarto-sized blocks ; it does happen, however, that we\nalways use quarto sheets and not foolscap, for our type-\nwritten records, which records Mrs. Leonard had never\nseen. In the reference to our work there is clearly visible\nthat keen, though kindly sense of humour which was\nvery characteristic of A. V. B. during her lifetime.\nSection VI. Daisy's Plans and Movements.\nWe now come to quite a short extract which occurred\non February 21st, 1917, during a sitting at which I alone\nwas present, acting as my own recorder. The extract\nrefers to a person whom we will call Daisy, and of whom\nwe shall have more to say later on. This extract was of\na prophetic nature so far as my knowledge was concerned ;\nhere it is :\nF. She says, did you see Daisy ?\nM. R. H. No, I can't see Daisy.\nF. But she says won't you be able to see her ?\nM. R. H. No, I'm afraid I won't ; has she got a message for\nDaisy ?\nF. You won't be able to see her ?\nM. R. H. I can't see her because she isn't here.\nF. Your Ladye thought somehow that she was going to\nbe here ; are you sure she has no intention of\ncoming here ?\nM. R. H. As far as I know she has none.\nF. Your Ladye doesn't know why, but she gets the\nimpression, the sort of feeling, that you will have\na chance of seeing Daisy.\n\f472 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nAnd again a few lines further on in my notes, after\na reference to Daisy having gone north and south, there\noccur the following words :\nM. R. H. Do I understand her to mean that this was in\nEngland ?\nF. She doesn't mention any particular country in con-\nnection with it, but she does seem to feel that\nthings are tending towards your seeing Daisy.\nNow, at the time of this sitting, the Daisy in question\nwas nursing the wounded in the Near East. I had not\nthe slightest idea that it would be possible for her to\nbreak her contract, even in the event of her wishing to\ndo so, as I had always understood that one was obliged\nto sign on for a definite period of time when undertaking\nsuch work. I was not expecting to see Daisy for at\nleast a year, if then. I wrote to Daisy, sending her out\na series of questions, among which I asked her whether\nshe had any intention of returning to England. She\nreplied in the following words :\n\" Yes, it is possible that\nI may return to England next month, in which case I\nshould of course see you. I have given in my resigna-\ntion here.\" This reply was written from the Near East\non March 10th, 1917, and I saw Daisy shortly after her\nreturn to England, which she reached on April 20th,\n1917. She has since consulted her diary at our request,\nand finds that her resignation was given in on February\n18th, 1917 ; she says that she had been meaning to resign\nfor some time prior to that date. The question will\nnaturally arise as to why A. V. B. should have troubled\nto get into Daisy's conditions, and to have divined\nthe unsettled state of her mind, which undoubtedly was\npresent at about the date of this sitting. There was a\nreason why A. V. B. should have been interested in\nDaisy, but we will not deal with this point here, as it\nbelongs to a later portion of this paper.\n\fLxxvm.] Apparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events. 473\nSection VII. Knowledge of Small Incidents connected\nwith M. R. H. and U. V. T.\nWe will next mention another slight indication of know-\nledge regarding contemporary events ; it occurred on\nFebruary 28th, 1917. I took the sitting and Lady Trou-\nbridge acted as recorder. A. V. B. gave the following\nwords through Feda :\nF. She says :\n\" Shall I come this afternoon ?\n\"\nM. R. H. Yes, and ask her to notice something about the\nroom and tell us about it next time.\nF. She says :\n\" Yes, I will ; I've been many, many\ntimes before when you were working, and I was\nwith you this morning before you got up.\" She\nthought you spoke to somebody, moved over and\ncalled out to somebody, not speaking quietly,\ncalling out something, can't you remember ?\nOnly a few words, you just moved over and said\na few words.\nAt the time of the sitting I denied this incident, but\nimmediately on our return home Lady Troubridge and I\nremembered it perfectly. I had spent the previous night\nat Lady Troubridge's house, and she had come in herself\nto wake me in the morning. She did so by letting the\nblind go up with a bang, and a flood of light struck\nmy eyes suddenly. I rolled over on to the other side\nof the bed, loudly voicing my indignation. The usual\nproceeding, when I am in my own flat, is much less\nabrupt, I being discreetly aroused by a servant with a\ncup of tea ; there is also no garish light let in upon me,\nso I have no occasion to expostulate.\nWe will now give an extract from the sitting of June\n6th, 1917, taken by Lady Troubridge and recorded by me.\nF. (sotto voce ; Pictures, pictures, pictures.) She wants now\nto talk about pictures.\nU. V. T. What pictures ?\nF. They're pictures on the earth plane, and it's\nnot one, particular picture either, it's pictures\n\f474 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [paet\nthat people would go and look at. She's interested\nin them specially, they're pictures that have to\ndo with you just now .\nU. V. T. It's funny.\nF. It's a place she wants to go to with you to look\nat pictures for a special purpose. Oh ! she says,\nshe's not only going, but that she has been there,\nand lately too. She says, there were several of\nthem, but one particular one, she wanted to see\nhow it was put.\nU. V. T. Yes ?\nF. She says she thought it was not put badly, but\nthat it certainty might have been put better.\nShe was pleased about it though, not so much\nabout where it was put, but about the picture\nitself. She keeps on showing Feda a picture ;\nit looks to Feda as if there was a very dark\nshade half way across it ; it seems to be much\nlighter across the top, then it's all dark at one\npoint in the middle. It's light on top and a\nkind of particular streak seems to come across\nthe middle, like a dark shade.\nU. V. T. What's the bottom like ?\nF. It's light again at the bottom, but the lightness\nat the bottom is a different kind to the top.\nU. V. T. I think I place it.\nF. Mrs. Una, it seems to be mixed up like at the\nbottom, it's got a muddly look.\nU. V. T. I wonder why she mentions all this.\nF. Oh ! she only wanted you to know that she had\nseen it, she likes to let you know when she sees\nthings on the earth plane clearly, she says that\nlately she has been trying to exercise this faculty,\nand to practise getting through what she has\nseen. She says that she sees a great deal,\nmuch more, she says, than she could ever get\non to Feda's brain ; Mrs Una, Feda doesn't think\nthat that picture was very important, it was\nonly something that she happened to see with\nyou.\n\flxxviii.] Apparent Knowledge of Contemporary Events. 475\nU. V. T. Why did she say she was pleased ?\nF. Because, she says, she does like it, she did and she\ndoes.\nRegarding the above extract, Lady Troubridge had\nrecently taken a house, and on May 31st, 1917, just six\ndays prior to this sitting, she and I had been together\nto a Depository, in order to speak about her furniture\nand effects which were stored there. She particularly\nwished to go over a number of pictures, and for this\npurpose was conducted into a special room ; she found\nto her great distress that her pictures had been stacked\nup anyhow, one against another ;\nwith the result that\nsome glasses were broken, and several frames injured.\nShe was particularly anxious as to the whereabouts and\ncondition of one special picture ; this was a large, square,\nwater-colour painting presented to her some years ago\nby Admiral Togo. We found that this picture had not\nsuffered any damage, having been placed rather more\ncarefully than the others. We think that this picture,\nwhich A. V. B. both knew and admired during her life-\ntime, is the one to which she alludes in the present\nsitting. This picture is not only rather beautiful, but\nin its composition is, to the European eye, unusual, and\nwe think that Feda's description is not devoid of interest.\nFeda tells us that A. V. B. is showing her a picture\nthat looks light at the top, with a land of particular\nstreak like a dark shade across the middle, that it seems\nto be much lighter across the top, and then that it is\nall dark at one point in the middle. Now, the upper\npart of the picture in question shows snow-capped Fuji\nYama, the sacred mountain, in early dawn against a pale\nsky ;\nnearly half-way down the picture in the middle\ndistance is a line of low hills forming, as Feda says,\na streak across the middle of the picture like a dark\nshade ; in the very centre of the picture in the nearer\ndistance is a bold mass of black rock rising from the\nsea ; this is apparently the object which leads Feda to say\nthat the picture is all dark at one point in the middk\n.\nLady Troubridge then asks Feda what the bottom of the\n\f476 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\npicture is like, and Feda replies by saying that it is\nlight at the bottom, but that the lightness at the bottom\nis of a different kind to the lightness at the top, she\nadds that it seems to be \" mixed up like \" at the bottom,\nand that it has got a \" muddly look.\" Now, the whole\nforeground of the picture which we believe A. V. B.\nto have been attempting to show Feda, is a mass of\nswirling, foamy shallows, the water and the foam together\ngiving a light, but as Feda rightly describes it, a mixed\nup or muddly look. There are one or two half-submerged\npoints of rock among the shallows, but the general effect\nof the foreground is one of light, swirling water.\nAnd this, we think, is the last extract pertaining to\nwhat would appear to be a knowledge of contemporary\nevents on the part of a purporting communicator, which\nwe will include in this paper. There are, of course, other\ninstances of this kind, but those that we have given, or\nto which we have alluded are, we think, among the most\ninteresting.\n\\\n\flxxviii.] Personal Touches and the A. V. B. Control. \u00b117\nCHAPTER IV.\nPersonal Touches and the A. V. B. Control.\nWe now feel it necessary to treat of what, for want of\na better term, we will call personal touches, which, although\nthey must rank as of very considerable importance among\nthose things which would appear to prove identity, are\nnone the less extremely difficult to define in a manner\nwhich will carry conviction to the minds of those who\nhave not known, and known intimately, the purporting\ncommunicator. What are personal touches ? At best\nthey are very subtle and often very elusive. We presume\nthat they would include, among other things, attitude of\nmind towards life in general, and if this be admitted,\nthen we feel that we have obtained (as far, that is to\nsay, as it is possible to obtain such a thing through an\nintermediary), a certain amount of evidence as to the\nidentity of the purporting communicator.\nTo begin then with the attitude of mind : throughout\nthe communications purporting to come from A. V. B.\nwhich we have received through Mrs. Leonard, there have\nbeen obvious a very marked tolerance, balance, and\nmoderation in the judgment of others ;\ntogether with a\nsense of humour which was never of an unkindly nature.\nAll these things were strongly characteristic of A. V. B.\nFrom time to time there has also appeared a desire on\nthe part of the purporting communicator to moderate\nany severe judgments on our part, and any tendency to\ngo to extremes, even in the matter of our work. This\nmental balance was also characteristic. Throughout the\nsittings there has also appeared a quiet determination,\nalmost amounting to a gentle sort of stubbornness, which\n\f478 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nwas very characteristic of A. V. B. This stubbornness\nhas once or twice been remarked on by Feda, as, for\ninstance, in the case of the mistake regarding the basement\nrooms at the house in Malvern Wells. Another character-\nistic which we have noticed, is that of a particular kind\nof childishness which A. V. B. retained until her last\nillness. This childishness took the form, among othei\nthings, of a love of appreciation, not of those things in\nwhich she seriously excelled, but of unimportant actions,\nor little new accomplishments acquired ; for instance, I\nheard a great deal more from her about the first sock\nthat she knitted than about the many songs that she\nhad, from time to time, composed and published, or about\nher much admired singing, which she was inclined to\nneglect. Quite characteristic of this attitude of mind\nwas the incident of the horse, around whose neck A. V. B.\nwas said to have placed her arm, an action which she was\nparticularly anxious that I should notice. (See above, p. 362)\nHad A. V. B. succeeded in sufficiently overcoming her fear\nof horses to put her arm around the neck of one,\nshe would most certainly, in this life, have called my\nattention to it, and expected me to praise her, as\nI should equally certainly have done. This childishness\nwhich we have spoken of often led to A. V. B.\ngetting her own way in a manner that was pleasant to\nall concerned. When bent upon some particular little\ntrifle, or, in fact, on doing anything that amused her,\nA. V. B. would sometimes repeat over and over again\nto herself in a monotonous undertone, such words as :\n'\u2022I will,\" or \"I want it,\" or \"I shall,\" or \"I love it,\"\nin so humorous a manner that all opposition waned.\nThe first allusion to this habit of repetition was given\nthrough Feda on June 6th, 1917. Lady Troubridge took\nthe sitting and 1 recorded. Here is the extract. Lady\nTroubridge had just been remarking how very good and\npatient Feda was, when the following occurred :\nF Oh ! but Feda loves it. Ladye says she loves it,\nshe loves it, she loves it, she loves it.\nU V. T. Did she say that, Feda %\n\fixxviii.] Personal Touches and the A. V. B. Control. 479\nF. Yes, you know she does repeat things sometimes,\nlike that.\nU. V. T. How do you mean, Feda ?\nF. Oh ! sometimes Feda catches her saying one or\ntwo Arords over and over again like that, some-\ntimes she does say little words over to herself,\nin a funny little way unlike other people.\nAnother and still more characteristic repetition of words\noccurred during an A. V. B. control later on in the same\nsitting. It was coupled with a point of evidential interest,\nwith which we will presently deal. And here it is\nnecessary to make a slight digression, in order to give\na few details regarding the A. V. B. control.\nThe first personal control attempted by A. V. B. took\nplace on January 19th, 1917. I was taking the sitting\nalone, and my attention was first called to the fact thai,\nsomething unusual was about to occur by Feda, who\nfidgeted uncomfortably, exclaiming at the same time :\n\" What are you trying to do, Ladye, what are you trying\nto do ?\n\" After these words, no more was heard of Feda,\nthe medium remaining perfectly still, and apparently,\ndeeply entranced, for what I should say was the space\nof a minute or two. When she began to speak again\nshe did so in an almost inaudible whisper, her first words\nbeing :\n\" Where are you ? Pull me forward.\" There was\nnothing evidential in this first A. V. B. control, as speech\nappeared very difficult and movement almost impossible.\nA certain amount of emotion was shown, but, on the\nwhole, admirable self-control was maintained on the part\nof the purporting communicator, which was again very\ncharacteristic of A. V. B. who was extremely self-controlled\nduring her life-time. Since January 19th, 1917, there\nhave been repeated efforts at an A. V. B. control, which has\nbeen very slowly growing in power and evidential value.\nTo return to the sitting of June 6th, 1917 ; after\nthe allusion made by Feda to A. V. B.'s habit of\nrepeating words, there occurred dining an A. V. B.\ncontrol, at the end of the same sitting, a spontaneous\nexample of this characteristic. A. V. B. made a state-\n\f480 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nment the accuracy of which I doubted (but which after-\nwards proved to be correct), and when I demurred, she\nsaid : \"I know it, I know it, I know it.\"\nAnother example of the habit of repeating words\noccurred on August 6th, 1917, during an A. V. B. control.\nA. V. B. had just announced her intention of accom-\nplishing some difficult feat in connection with communi-\ncation, and when Lady Troubridge expressed some doubt,\nA. V. B. rejoined: \"I will, I will, I will, I will.\"\nDuring the early A. V. B. controls, A. V. B. com-\nplained that she could not make the medium laugh. One\nday, however, she suddenly succeeded in doing so, and\nwhat ensued was extraordinarily reminiscent of A. V. B.'s\nown laugh, and this characteristic laugh has, since thenr\noften occurred. On several occasions the timbre of Mrs.\nLeonard s voice has changed, and has become very like\nA. V. B.'s voice ;\nstartlingly so, once or twice. A. V. B.\nherself has remarked upon this, which appears only to\nbe possible during the earlier part of the personal controls.\nOn one occasion A. V. B. said discontentedly :\n\" Oh !\nnoAv the power is going, can\"t you hear my voice getting\nMrs. Leonardy again ?\n\" which statement was correct.\nMany little characteristic things have occurred during\nthese A. V. B. controls, which, however, are somewhat\ndifficult to put into words. With regard to the timbre\nof the voice and laugh, I fully realise that under such\ncircumstances one's own imagination may play a very\nlarge part, but fortunately my collaborator, Lady Trou-\nbridge, has been present on many occasions when these\nfamiliar intonations and the laugh have occurred, and she\nalso considers that they are strongly reminiscent of the\npurporting communicator.\nOn July 13th, 1917, there was a personal control by\nA. V. B., and the first movement that was made was an\nattempt at a posture of the hand. This pose of the hand\nwas not quite completed, but appeared to be the beginning\nof an old and well-known attitude characteristic of\nA. V. B.'s hand. We made no remark upon it, hoping\nthat some day the position of holding the hand might\nbe accurately demonstrated.\n\flxxviii.] Personal Touches and the A. V. B. Control. 481\nAnother interesting feature of the A. V. B. control\nis the fact that the purporting communicator has occasion-\nally appeared to be dissatisfied with the pronunciation\nof certain words. For instance, A. V. B. has struggled\nwith the word \" often.\" Mrs. Leonard, in the normal\nstate, pronounces the T in this word, she says \" off -ten.''\nA. V. B. always pronounced it \" orfen.\" Constantly\nduring an A. V. B. control this word is pronounced in\nMrs. Leonard's fashion ; on one occasion, however, A. V. B.\nappeared to realise what was happening, and a little\nrehearsal ensued. She only once succeeded in saying\n\" orfen,\" repeating \" off-ten,\" and then \" orferten,\norferten,\" several times in rather a bewildered manner.\nWhen asked what she was doing, she replied vaguely that\nshe\nt;\nwas just trying it.\"\nOn August 5th, 1917, however, during an A. V. B.\ncontrol, this word \" often \" was pronounced in A. V. B.'s\nown fashion ; after having said \" orfen,\" twice, with\nperfect ease and naturalness, the purporting communicator\nsuddenly slipped back into Mrs. Leonard's pronunciation,\nwithout apparently noticing the difference.\nA personal touch occurred very early in our sittings\nwith Mrs. Leonard, in fact, it was at the end of our\nfirst joint sitting, on October 2nd, 1916. When saying\n\" goodbye \" Feda said :\n\" She says '\nBless you both.\"\n\"\nBless you, or Bless you both, were expressions constantly\nused by A. V. B., and had been used by her to Lady\nTroubridge and myself many times, if we chanced to\nbe going out together on any occasion when A. V. B.\ndid not accompany us. This expression of \" Bless you \"\nor \"Bless you both\" has recurred through the sittings,\nand on August 5th, 1917, during an A. V. B. control,\nwas used for the first time by one of us. Lady Trou-\nbridge, alluding to A. V. B. and another person, said :\n\" Well, bless you both.\" A. V. B. looked puzzled for\na few moments, remarking after a pause :\n\" \/ said\n'\nBless you both,' too.\" It was as though, in searching\nher memory for the association called up by these words,\nit had struck her that they were words which she herself\nhad been in the habit of using. It must, of course;' be\n\f482 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nunderstood that A. V. B.'s memory and powers of ex-\npression always appear to be adversely affected during\na personal control of the medium ; she has herself com-\nplained bitterly of this on several occasions. And now,\nbefore leaving the subject of the A. V. B. control, we\nmust mention three incidents, although they have no\nbearing on personal touches.\nOn January 23rd, 1917, at which sitting A. V. B. was\ncontrolling for the second time only, she began almost\nimmediately to feel Mrs. Leonard's face, with apparent\ncuriosity ; she then remarked :\n\" What's the matter with\nmy face ? It feels thinner and bonier than it used to be.\"\nNow, this was correct, as Mrs. Leonard's face is quite\na different build from A. V. B.'s, it being not only\nthinner, but the bony construction being larger and more\nmarked.\nOn May 2nd, 1917, another interesting incident occurred.\nA. V. B. begged us not to talk while she thought some-\nthing out, she then asked what date it was, and was\ntold that it was May 2nd. A pause ensued, during which\nthe communicator was apparently thinking deeply ; after\nwhich she remarked that something had occurred about\nthis time of the year, and asked whether an anniversary\nwere not coming. She then murmured :\n\" The first of\nMay \" several times. Being unable to place the date\nfor the moment, I promised to refer back to her old\ndiary, but A. V. B. said that there was no necessity for\nthis. I was still at sea, but having in mind the date\nof her death, which took place on May 25th, I told\nA. V. B. that one important thing had occurred about\nthis time of the year, asking her whether she remembered\nwhat sort of a thing it was ; to which she replied in\nwords to this effect :\n\" You must look upon it as my\nbirthday, never think of funerals, they are horrible things,\nyou see it was like a birthday to me, as you will realise\nfor yourself when you come over. But something did\noccur on the 1st of May, or round about that time, which\nled up to the other thing.\" Now the date of A. V. B.'s\ndeath appeared in the Press at the time, and consequently\nthe evidential value of the reference, as above given, is\n\flxxviii.] Personal Touches and the A. V. B. Control. 483\nlargely diminished ; but one evidential thing there does\nremain in this statement, namely, the reference to \" some-\nthing \" which was said to have occurred round about\nthe 1st of May, and which led up to the other thing,\nnamely, to her death. On the 29th of April, 1916,\nA. V. B. got a sudden affection of her sight ; she began\nto see long black streaks, which she described as being\nlike bits of chenille velvet floating in front of one of her\neyes. She consulted an oculist, who thought that this\ncondition would clear up, which, however, it did not do.\nAnd on the 15th of May, 1916, there occurred her stroke.\nWe have had the opportunity of consulting two doctors,\nin whose opinion we have confidence, and they both tell\nus that it often happens that just such an affection of\nthe eye as A. V. B. suffered from, is liable to occur when\na stroke is imminent. Neither of these doctors was\naware when we questioned them that our interest in\nthis matter was connected even partially with Psychical\nResearch. This visual affection being of very short\nduration, there was no opportunity for it to become\ngenerally known. A few people may have known of it\noutside of A. V. B.'s immediate home circle, but we do\nnot think so. Normal knowledge regarding this point\non Mrs. Leonard's part would therefore appear to be\nimprobable. It may be as well to insert here, one or\ntwo extracts from A. V. B.'s diary, on the subject of\nthis affection of the eye.\nEXTRACT FROM A. V. B.'s DIARY, 1916.\nFirst Entry re Eyes.\nSaturday, April 29th, 1916. Sat in Green Park trying\nto read. Had black specks floating before\nmy eyes.\nSunday, April 30th, 1916. My left eye bothered with\nfloating chenille worms !\nMonday, May 1st, 1916. Eyes rather better.\nWednesday, May 3rd, 1916. John went off at 9.30\nto the flat. Picked me up at noon to see\n2 H\n\f484 Miss Radclyffe-HaM and Lady Troubridge. [part\nP. [oculist], 1\nhe examined my eyes, thought\na small blood clot accounted for the specks\nbefore my left eye. Slept and felt better,\nbut eye still bothering me.\nThere are other entries regarding the eye, which, as\nwe have previously stated, never got well. But those\ngiven are, we think, sufficient to show that the affection\nof the eye occurred around about the 1st of May, which\naffection, as we have said, was considered by two doctors\nto have been a premonitory symptom of the stroke.\n[See Appendix A.]\nAnother interesting little incident during a personal\ncontrol occurred on June 13th, 1917. A. V. B. put\nher hand up to her head and began to laugh, remarking,\nas she did so :\n\" I am wearing a hair-net, hoiv funny !\n\"\nNow, A. V. B. during her lifetime never, under any\ncircumstances, wore a hair-net. She had naturally wavy\nhair, and knowing her as well as I do, I feel sure that\nit would have struck her as humorous that she should\nwear a net.\nIt may be as well to state how the notes of these\nA. V. B. controls have been made. It has not been\npossible to write them down during the actual control,\nas it appeared to be absolutely necessary that the sitter,\nand, when present, the recorder as well, should con-\ncentrate their entire attention on the medium, in order\nto observe closely all gestures ; and still more in order\nto be able to catch every word spoken, because the voice\nduring an A.. V. B. control is sometimes very weak and\nlow. The A. V. B. controls always occur at the end of\nthe sitting ; our method has therefore been to record\nthe notes while the medium is coming out of trance,\ngetting down in that interval all points of evidential\ninterest, and omitting everything of a merely personal\nand non-evidential nature. This has not proved difficult\nup to the present, as the A. V. B. controls have generally\nbeen but of short duration, and there have seldom\n1\nThe initial has been altered and the full name omitted.\n\flxxviii.] Personal Touches and the A. V. B. Control. 485\noccurred more than one or two evidential points during\neach control.\nNothing of any kind has ever been given away by\nLady Troubridge or myself, who have regarded the personal\ncontrol as a possible fruitful source of further evidence.\nAfter this digression we must return, before closing this\nsection of our paper, to two other personal touches which\nwere obtained through Feda. On December 20th, 1916,\nat a sitting taken by me, Lady Troubridge recording, we\nobtained the following :\nM. R. H. Tell Ladye that next Wednesday I shan't take\nthe sitting myself because I'm bringing a gentle-\nman who will take it.\nF. She says, all right, but unless you're good at\nChristmas, she'll push that gentleman out, and\nmake you take the sitting yourself. And she\nsays you must be good after that awful threat.\nAwful threat ! That sounds dreadful to Feda,\nbut she's only joking.\nNow, A. V. B. during her lifetime constantly used the\nwords \" awful threat.\" If I suggested doing anything\nof which she disapproved, she would laughingly cap my\nsuggestion by a far rasher one, which she proposed to\ncarry out herself, in the event of my proving intractable.\nShe would often say :\n\" Now, I know you can't do it\nafter that awful threat.\" If \/ made any wild proposal\nshe was in the habit of saying :\n\" What an awful threat !\n\"\nConsequently, when these words came through Feda they\nstruck us as being very familiar.\nOn May 30th, 1917, at a sitting at which I alone was\npresent, acting as my own recorder, a new communicator\narrived at the same time as A. V. B. He was\napparently a close relation of mine, and attempted to\nprove his identity by describing through Feda, among\nother things, the painting of pictures, for which he had\na talent during his lifetime. This purporting communi-\ncator was able to give a very good account of himself,\nassisted, as it appeared, by A. V. B., but he got rather\nstuck when he tried to show Feda that he had been in\n\f486 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nthe habit of squeezing paints on to a palette from a\ntube. Here is the extract :\nF. And now he takes up something and does this :\n(sotto voce : Squish.) (Here Feda makes the\ngesture of squeezing paint out of a tube on\nto a palette.) It's something very small he's\ngot in his right hand.\nM. R. H. (laughingly) I understand that, but what made you\nsay \" Squish \" ?\nF. Ladye says \" Squish,\" she says it didn't always\nmake that noise, of course, but that somehow it\nsuggests it ;\nyou expect it to say \" Squish.\"\nNow, this is just the sort of thing that A. V. B.\nwould have said ; she was fond of coining words and often\nthought of humorous similes ; in fact, it sounded like\nher.\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 487\nCHAPTER V.\nKnowledge shown of Matters entirely unknown\nto the Sitters.\nWe will bring this paper to a close by giving three\nextracts from sittings which we consider, in one respect\nat all events, to be the most remarkable which we have\nhad with Mrs. Leonard. We feel that the extracts with\nwhich we are about to deal have a right to stand alone\n.\nsince they treat principally of matters which were entirely\nunknown either to myself or to Lady Troubridge at the\ntime of the sittings.\nSection I. Concerning the Dog Billy.\nWe will begin with an extract from the sitting of\nDec. 6th, 1916. I took the sitting, Lady Troubridge\nrecording, and the following occurred :\nF. Bihy, she says :\n\" Billy.\" Do you know who that\nis ?\nM. R. H. No.\nF. She says : \" Billy.\"\nU. V. T. Who is it ? Someone she knew on the earth plane ?\nF. When Feda asks her she is rather confusing. She\nsays : \"I do know him, but in rather a peculiar\nsense.\" You've got to go into the country for\nthis, right into the proper country, and Billy\ndoesn't seem to belong to the house, but to just\noutside the house. She says Billy is a well-\nknown character. She thinks it will come to you.\n\f488 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nU. V. T. I think I understand.\nF. It seems funny, very funny to Feda. She says\nit's rather difficult to explain her acquaintance\nwith this Billy. She says it's not quite on the\nusual lines.\nU. V. T. Is Billy nice to look at ?\nF. She says :\n\" Not very pretty.\"\nU. V. T. That's true.\nF. She says it just depends upon your eye for beauty.\nU. V. T. Is she sure she knew Billy on the earth plane ?\nF. She doesn't seem sure, but she knows Billy quite\nwell now.\nU. V. T. Did I know him ?\nF. Yes.\nU. V. T. How old was Billy when he left the earth plane ?\nM. R. H. She hasn't said he's dead.\nU. V. T. But she said that she knows him now.\nF. Yes, she doesn't think she knew him on the earth\nplane, but she knows him now, he has become\nrather attached to her, rather to the amusement\nof some of the people over there.\nU. V. T. I'm rather interested in Billy.\nF. She says Billy takes quite an uncanny interest in\nher. (Here Feda gives an excellent imitation of\na dog sniffing.) She's doing like this, and she\nsays he takes an uncanny interest in her. She\nsays it's quite embarrassing sometimes. She says :\n\" I can't say more, but do you understand ?\n\"\nU. V. T. Yes, will she give my love to Billy ?\nF. Yes, she says do you want her to kiss Billy ?\nU. V. T. Yes, please.\nF. (Touches her forehead) She says she will kiss him\njust here, not on his month. She says she won't\nkiss him mi his mouth and she canM very well\nkiss him on his cheek, she would rather kiss him\nhere. (Feda again indicates her forehead, and\nbegins making sniffing noises like a dog.) Feda\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 489\nwould like to know why she does that. She's\nvery happy to-day, and she's enjoying herself.\nNow this Billy, who was, at first, unrecognised by\neither of us, was recognised quite soon by Lady Trou-\nbridge as being a wire-haired terrier of hers, who had\ndied about fifteen months prior to this sitting, and about\neight months prior to A. V. B.'s death. The dog had\nbeen pensioned by Lady Troubridge's mother with some\nladies at Boscombe, owing to Lady Troubridge being much\nabroad, and Lady Troubridge had not seen him for eleven\nyears. Feda says you have got to go right into the\nproper country, when she describes Billy ; this may mean\nthat you pass through the country from London to reach\nBoscombe. Boscombe itself, of course, is a town. All\nhis life Billy had been considered to be quite a character,\nbeing not only remarkably intelligent, but very original.\nIn the present sitting, Feda does not appear to grasp\nthe fact that Billy is a dog, although her description of\nhim is pretty unmistakable as such. In any case, if\nshe has grasped that he is a dog, she either cannot say\nso, or wishes to keep up the pretence of not imderstanding.\nElaborate description, allied with apparent inability to\nrecognise and name the simplest object, does sometimes\noccur in the Leonard phenomena, as in that of most\ntrance mediums, and suggests forcibly that we are very\nfar from understanding in what manner the impressions\ndescribed reach the so-called \" Control.\" Sentences occasion-\nally occur during the sittings which, although attributed\nby Feda to A. V. B., do not suggest A. V. B.'s way of\nexpressing herself. One occurs in this extract when Feda\nsays :\n\" She says it just depends on your eye for beauty.\"\nIt is as if from time to time, words calculated to express\nthe sense of the communicator's remarks were picked\nfrom the medium's brain, or perhaps have been learnt\nby Feda from other sitters, and are used by her to save\nherself trouble. On the other hand, very many turns of\nphrase and of mind have been startlingly reminiscent of\nthe purporting communicator.\nThe next reference to Billy occurred on December\n\f490 Miss Radclyffe-Hatt and Lady Troubridge. [part\n13th, 1916, at a sitting taken by Lady Troubridge which\nI recorded. The reference was spontaneously made by Feda,\nand was as follows :\nF. She says, she's seen Billy and kissed him.\nIT. V. T. I'm glad.\nF. She says Billy rubbed against her face. She says\nhe didn't lick her face, she says that wouldn't\nhave been very nice. She says he rubbed her\nwith his muzzle. What does she mean by\nmuzzle ?\nU. V. T. Well, ask her why she doesn't show you Billy ?\nF. Yes, Feda would like to see him. She says he's\nnot very pretty.

Well, I'm not sure.\nF. She says it was mottly inside, and she says, can't\nyou ask someone who knows ?\nU. V. T. I will see,\nF. She says he is two shades, and that one merges\ninto the other and harmonises very well. (Sotto\nvoce : Brun Brin Brun Brin .) Oh f\nIt's a funny word, Feda can't get it. It doesn't\nsound to Feda like a colour, but it begins with a\nB, but it's not brown or black or blue, She says\nit's a bit mottled, and that when you look at him,\nit strikes you. It's somehow more like two shades.\n(Sotto voce : Try to show Feda what he's like,\nnow.) She says she told him she was kissing\nhim from you, on the forehead. She says he\njumps about, that he bounds and jumps over\nthings, and that he's more graceful than Feda\nthinks. She says he's very well, and will be in\na very good condition for you when you come\nover. Did you know that when he first passed\nover he was not in a good condition ? Because\nhe was not, and there was something the matter\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 491\nwith his hind leg, or his foot. He was not in\nan unhealthy state for very long, she says he\nwent over rather suddenly. There was some-\nthing wrong with his foot, or the lower part of\nhis leg. Oh ! Now she sarys there was some-\nthing wrong once underneath his arm. (Here\nFeda indicates the arm-pit.) Only he hasn't got\nany arms, but it was under there.\nU. V. T. I remember that.\nF. But she says that had nothing to do with his\npassing on, but that he certainly had something\nwrong with his foot or his back leg.\nU. V. T. That I can find out, perhaps.\nF. She savs that they used to turn his feet up, and\nlook at them between the toes.\nU. V. T. Yes ?\nF. She says he didn't like it. (Sotto voce : What\nare you saying ? He couldn't go for a walk\nby himself.) She says he goes off by himself\nsometimes on what she calls \"foraging expeditions\n\"\nand that he seems to enjoy himself, because he\nlooks so awfully pleased and proud when he\ncomes back. She says he's got a good deal of\nexpression. She says it's funny to talk of ex-\npression in anyone like Billy, but that he does\nlook as though he had done something he would\nlike to tell you all about. She says his front\nlegs are rather shorter than his hind legs.\nU. V. T. I don't remember that.\nF. His coat is very good, she says. She says she's\ngot him a collar.\nU. V T. That's very nice of her.\nF. She shows Feda that it's rather a funny shape, it\nseems to be broader under the chin, and it\nseems to have sparklies on it. She's very fond\nof Billy, she says she's not at all wary of him.\nShe says that on the earth plane, she might have\nwanted to keep him at his distance. She says\nhe goes walks by himself. Feda wishes she*d\nshow him to Feda.\n\f492 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nU. V. T. Why won't she ?\nF. She can't, perhaps ; she doesn't have him in the\nhouse. There's a place for him in the garden,\nshe thinks he would feel strange in the house.\nHe loves the garden and he rolls and lies on his\nback and kicks his legs, and he grunts and makes\na funny noise, not like a pig. She says he once\nhad a knobbly thing, sticking out on one of his\nlegs, it was a little peculiarity, she says.\nU. V. T. I don't remember that.\nF. She says that all these trifling things might appear\nto some people like rubbish, but that these\nintimate things are important.\nThis second reference to Billy included statements of\nfacts about the dog that were quite unknown to Lady\nTroubridge or myself at the time of the sitting. Before\ndealing with these, some mention must be made of those\npoints which, while being accurate, were within the\nknowledge of one or both of us.\nAn attitude of mind very characteristic of A. V. B.\nwhere dogs were concerned is shown at the beginning of\nthe extract, when Feda tells us that A. V. B. says that\nit would not have been very nice had Billy licked her\nface. A. V. B. was never a real dog lover, and would\ncertainly have objected to a dog licking her face. She\nnever allowed this even in the case of a dog that I gave\nher, and of which she grew very fond. On the other\nhand, Mrs. Leonard, who is a great dog-lover, has been\nseen by M. R. H. and U. V. T. to allow her dog to do\nthis.\nFecla next tells us that Billy's mouth is dark inside,\nindicating the lips and gums. Undoubtedly most dogs'\nHps are liver-coloured or black, Billy's certainly were\n;\nthe roof of his mouth was dark and mottled, and his\ngums may likewise have been mottled.\nWe next come to the description of his general colouring,\nwhich, according to Feda, is of two shades, and she tries\nto pronounce some word that appears to us to be an\nattempt at \" brindle.\" Billy was a very heavily marked\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 493\nterrier, especially about the head and muzzle. There is\nan oil painting of his head by Lady Troubridge in exist-\nence, which shows this very clearly. The dog's body\nwas also heavily marked ; his coat consisted of three colours,\nto be accurate, white, black and tan. Feda mentions only\ntwo. His tan and black merged into each other, but\nbrindle is not a very usual term to use in this con-\nnection when speaking of a terrier, although it is not\nincorrect. Undoubtedly Billy had markings on him that\nwere a mixture of black and tan.\nA. V. B. next tells us, through Feda, that Billy jumps\nabout and bounds over things. One may say that this\nwould be apphcable to very many dogs, and yet Lady\nTroubridge and I have both had several dogs who\nnever did anything of the kind. Billy, on the other\nhand, was very active in his youth, and was given to\njumping over spiked railings among other things, to\nthe great anxiety of his owner. And now occur the\npoints re Billy's health, all of which, with two exceptions,\nwere unknown to us at the time of this sitting. We\nmust skip these points, for the moment, however, and\ndeal with the remaining generalities first.\nA. V. B. tells us, through Feda, that Billy goes for walks\nby himself on foraging expeditions. Now this was\nmarkedly characteristic, at all events of the earthly Billy,\nwhen Lady Troubridge had him. Billy was a person of\ngreat independence, and would walk all over London by\nhimself, finding his way home from the most unlikely\nplaces. He was not only a rover by nature, but a most\nunregenerate scavenger, and his foraging expeditions, on\nthis plane, led to a permanent muzzle for the protection\nof his digestion.\nWe do not know whether Feda is correct, or not, when\nshe states that Billy's front legs are shorter than his back\nones. Many terriers that are not pure bred have this\ndefect, but Lady Troubridge cannot remember whether it\nexisted in Billy's case.\nFeda next tells us that A. V. B. remarks on his coat\nbeing very good. In life Billy's coat was rather a\nfeature, at all events in the eyes of the uninitiated ; it was\n\f494 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [pakt\nthick and very silky in texture ; it is highly improbable\nthat A. V. B. would consider this a blemish, as I never kept\nwire-haired terriers during our life together, and she knew\nnothing at all regarding their points. Following on the\nremark about Billy's coat, there occurs an example of pure\n\" Feda talk,\" when Feda begins to describe a collar of a\nfancy shape, and goes on to elaborate her statement by saying\nthat this collar seems to have \" sparklies \" on it, \" sparklies\n\"\nbeing her term for precious stones. It would be hard\nto imagine a collar more unsuitable for Billy than the\none described by Feda ;\nespecially in view of the de-\nscription of Billy himself that she has already given.\nLater on, she accentuates the fact that Billy was a rough\ndog, by telling us that he is not kept in the house, but\nin the garden, and yet this out-door dog is said to be\nwearing a jewelled collar ! It appears possible that\nA. V. B. did actually say that she had given a collar to\nBilly, the description thereof, however, can only have\nemanated from Feda. It is not at all suggestive of Mrs.\nLeonard's influence. 1\nThis kind of elaboration on the part of the control\noccurs very seldom during the Leonard trances, and\nwhen it does occur, it nearly always seems to partake\n1\nSince this Paper has been completed, our attention has been drawn\nto a photograph of A. V. B. taken with her French bull-dog. In this\nphotograph the dog is wearing a deep collar heavily studded with\ncircular brass bosses ; the brass bosses show up very brightly in the\nphotograph, and I remember that A. V. B. always insisted on their\nbeing polished daily. In addition to the deep collar the dog is wearing\na jade ball on a chain, the chain is partly concealed by the collar,\nbeing only visible in front, where it hangs down in a V with the ball\non the end, giving the impression that it forms a part of the collar.\nIt is just possible that it is this collar and ornament that the com-\nmunicator was trying to show. The impression of \"Sparklies\" may\nhave been derived by Feda from the shiny brass bosses, and her curious\nimpression that the collar was \" broader under the chin \" may have\nbeen derived from an imperfect vision on her part of the jade\nball on the chain above referred to. Dog-collars set with imitation\njewels are occasionally sold, but a dog-collar that is broader under\nthe chin is practically unknown ; at least I have never come across such\na thing, and this fact in itself makes it appear unlikely that Feda would\nhave mentioned such a peculiarity unless she had had something to\ngo on.\n\flxxviii.] Knoivledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 495\nof the Oriental's childish love of gaudiness. A similar\ninstance was remarked on by us, when dealing with the\nsitting of April 25th, 1917, during which Feda stated that\nA. V. B. had a gold case for her guitar. Curiously\nenough, in that instance, there came, side by side with\nthe mention of the gold case, the evidential statement\nwith regard to there being no ribbons on A. V. B.\"s\nguitar. It would seem as though Feda's imagination\nmust have been strenuously controlled just there, and it\nis rather amusing to notice a slight disapproval on her\npart, regarding the simplicity of the instrument. She\nremarks :\n\" Funny, Mrs. Twonnie, do you know, she\ndoesn't seem to like ribbons. Feda likes ribbons, lots\nof ribbons !\n\"\nTo return to the present sitting of Dec. 6th, 1916.\nFeda says that A. V. B. is very fond of Billy, and is\nnot at all \" wary \" of him, but admits that on the earth\nplane, she might have wanted to keep him at his distance,\nand that Billy lives in the garden, as A. V. B. thinks\nhe would feel strange in the house. There is no doubt\nthat A. V. B. would have wanted to keep a dog of the\n\" Billy \" type very much at his distance, in her lifetime.\nShe was not at all fond of rough, effusive dogs ; in fact,\nshe was timid of them. When I first met her this\ntimidity was very marked ; she was frankly frightened\nof dogs in those days. In this connection Feda uses the\nword \" wary,\" as she did also at a subsequent sitting on\nJanuary 3rd, 1917, when speaking of A. V. B.'s fear of\nhorses (see above, p. 363), and we comment upon it, because,\nalthough we cannot remember that it was ever an ex-\npression of A. V. B.'s, \" wary \" is an expression of Mrs.\nLeonard's. Both Lady Troubridge and I heard her use this\nword one day, when in her normal state. But although\nthe word may have been picked from the medium's\nbrain, the sense conveyed thereby is, in this instance,\nperfectly accurate, as expressing A. V. B.'s feelings in the\npast towards dogs in general, and more especially towards\ndogs of the \" Billy \" type.\nBilly is said to prefer the garden to the house, and\nhere again a good point is made, as Billy, during his life\n\f496 Miss Radclyffe-HaU and Lady Troubridge. [part\nwith Lady Troubridge, spent his days preferably outside\nthe front door, showing a marked aversion to remaining\nin the house.\nWe will now return to the points about Billy's health,\naround which centres the principal interest of this sitting.\nThese points were as follows :\n1. Billy was not in a good condition when he first went\nover (i.e. at the time of his death), but was\nnot in an unhealthy state for very long ; he died\nsuddenly.\n2. Billy had something the matter with his hind leg\nor his foot.\n3. Billy had once had something wrong with him, under\nhis arm in the arm-pit (i.e. under the fore leg,\nwhere it joins the body).\n4. But that particular condition had nothing to do with\nhis death.\n5. They would turn Billy's feet up and examine between\nthe toes, a proceeding which he did not like.\n6. And lastly, Billy had a knobbly thing sticking out\non one of his legs.\nWe will deal first with the two points out of the six\nwhich were known to us at the time of the sitting.\nFirstly, then, Feda is correct when she states that Billy\ndied suddenly. Billy was destroyed at the request of\nLady Troubridge's mother, who hearing that he was\nboth blind and deaf from old age, took the most\nmerciful course open to her. Some time afterwards,\nwhen Lady Troubridge happened to mention Billy, she was\ntold that he had been destroyed. Secondly, and thirdly,\nFeda is correct in stating that, at one time, Billy had an\ninjury under what she calls his arm, but that this parti-\ncular condition had nothing to do with his death. During\nBilly's life with Lady Troubridge, he had a very bad\nfight. He was attacked by a large bulldog and severely\nbitten under the fore leg, nearly into the lung ; the wound\nvery nearly proved fatal, and was the only serious dis-\naster that ever befell him, so far as Lady Troubridge\n\fLxxvm.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 497\nknew at the time of the sitting. We feel practically\ncertain that A. V. B., during her lifetime, had heard an\naccount of this battle, and we fancy, also, that she knew\nthat Billy had been destroyed, though we cannot be sure\nof either of these points. Regarding the other four points\nmentioned Lady Troubridge and I were in entire ignorance.\nIt must be borne in mind that Lady Troubridge had not\nseen the dog for many years, and I never. It was\nnecessary, therefore, to write to Miss Collis, at Boscombe,\nthe lady with whom Billy had been boarded, and when doing\nso, it appeared inadvisable to mention the alarming word\n\" Medium.\" Lady Troubridge therefore wrote to the effect\nthat she had had a very vivid dream about her old dog,\nand proceeded to enumerate the points regarding his\nhealth which she said she had dreamt of. She asked\nMiss Collis whether any of these symptoms had ever\nexisted in Billy's case. Here is Miss Collis's reply to\nthat letter :\nSt. Thomas's Day, 1916.\nDear Madam,\nWe do not remember dear little Billy hurting his\nfoot specially at any time, but for years he used often\nto cry out if his leg was touched. We used to think\nit was rheumatism. And latterly he did have a wart,\nmy sister thinks it was on the top of his left leg, also\nduring the last part of the time he got little lumps or\nwarts all over. The vet. said it was from old age. He\nwas very old, I think Mrs. Taylor said seventeen years,\nand very blind, and it made one anxious, and we thought\nit better he should be put to sleep. Also, a few weeks\nbefore the end, he had a bite from another dog on his\nback, which we were afraid would not heal. I think this\nhelped us to make up our minds to part with him. Mrs.\nTaylor thought when she saw him in the summer that it\nmight not be well to keep him much longer. I think it\nwas the 2oth of September, last year, that he was put\nto sleep. We did not lay him to rest till the next day,\nwhen we did it ourselves in his basket and his rugs, just\n\f498 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nas he was, and covered him up very gently. He was\nsuch a dear, funny little dog, with such sweet ways.\nHoping Mrs. Taylor and all are well,\nYours faithfully,\n(Signed) Edith F. S. Collis.\nThis letter was quite clear, and corroborated Feda's\nstatements, inasmuch as Miss Collis said that Billy had\nhad a bite on his back shortly before the end, which\nwould not heal, and which we may therefore conclude\nproduced a specifically unhealthy condition. Also that\nhe had had for some time an affection of his leg, which\ncaused him to cry out when the leg was touched, and\nalso that he had a wart on his leg. She omitted to\nstate, however, whether anyone had examined Billy's\nfeet between the toes, and also which leg it was that\ncaused Billy to cry out when it was touched. Lady\nTroubridge therefore wrote again to Miss Collis, asking\nher to clear up these points, but being very careful in\nno way to suggest to her which leg we thought it might\nbe that had hurt him. Miss Collis replied as follows :\nDec. 29th, 1916.\nI am sorry to have been so long in replying to\nyour second letter about dear little Billy. One could\nwish there was a future for him, and I felt that at the\ntime we lost him, but we can trust him with his Maker\nand knoAv that if it is best, it will be so. It was a\nback leg he did not like touched, but though my sister\nwashed him once a week, I am sorry we never thought\nto look between his toes. I can't think of anything\nmore specially to tell you about him to-night, but shall\nalways be pleased to write about him if you think of\nanything. . . .\nYours sincerely,\n(Signed) E. Collis.\nAll the points given by Feda had thei'efore been\ncorroborated by Miss Collis, with the exception of one.\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 499\nFeda speaks of someone having looked between Billy's\ntoes, a proceeding to which he objected, but, according\nto Miss Collis, no one had looked between Billy's toes,\nand we consequently wrote that down as a mistake.\nIt appeared to me to be likely that Lady Troubridge's\nmother had known many of the details given, especially\nas she had seen the dog during the summer prior to his\ndeath, and I thought it just possible that she might have\nmentioned them to Lady Troubridge in the course of\nconversation. Lady Troubridge felt quite sure that this\nwas not the she had a definite recollection of\nher mother's reply, on the last occasion when she had\nasked her about Billy. She called upon her mother,\nhowever, and made enquiries, in the course of conver-\nsation, regarding Billy's ailments. During this conver-\nsation Mrs. Taylor did not mention any of the four\nsymptoms under discussion. Lady Troubridge then told\nher mother about these symptoms, and Mrs. Taylor said\nthat this was the first that she had heard of them. We\nallowed a little time to elapse, and then Lady Troubridge\nwrote to her mother, clearly stating the symptoms and\nrequesting her mother to make a statement in writing,\nregarding her knowledge of same. Mrs. Taylor's reply\nwas as follows :\n10. 3. 1917.\nI cannot have told you the following facts about\nBilly, because I did not know them myself, until you\n* told me of them in February of this year.\n1. That he had any kind of a lumpy thing on one of\nhis legs.\n2. That his back leg was painful in any way, or had\nanything the matter with it.\n3. That there was any special reason why he should\nhave been in a particularly unhealthy condition just a\nlittle while prior to his death, and I did not know that\nhe had been bitten by another dog just then.\n(Signed) Minna Taylor.\nHaving got thus far, we read the sitting to Miss Newton,\nand she felt that it would be advisable to get corro-\n2i\n\f500 Miss Radciyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nboration of the] points I regarding Billy's ailments from\nsomeone in addition to Miss Collis, as the more evidence\nobtained on such a point, the better. She suggested\nthat the Veterinary Surgeon who had attended Billy\nshould be communicated with, especially regarding the\nbite on the back which Miss Collis had feared would\nnot heal, and which, having been received only a few\nweeks prior to Billy's death, appeared to give a certain\nimportance to Feda's words when she said that he had\nbeen in an unhealthy state at the time of his death,\nbut not for long. This statement of Feda's appeared\nto us to point to some recent and particular condition,\nrather than to a general and gradual state of infirmity\nresulting from old age. We decided, therefore, to visit\nBoscombe on the earliest opportunity, and did so on\nApril 10th. 1917. During that visit, we drew up very\ncomplete notes of our proceedings, from which we have\nbeen able to prepare a statement, and we cannot do\nbetter, we think, than include it here.\nThe Linden Hall Hydro,\nBoscombe.\nApril 13th, 1917.\nStatement by M. R. H. and U. V. T.\nThe Billy Incident.\nLeonard Sittings of Dec. 6th and Dec. 13th, 1916.\n\u2022\nIt was suggested by Miss Isabel Newton, Secretary of\nthe S.P.R., after the notes of the above-mentioned sittings\nhad been read to her, that a further investigation re the\ndetails concerning Billy's state of health prior to his\ndeath should be undertaken, and, if possible, corroborative\nstatements or the reverse obtained from the Veterinary\nSurgeon and any persons, other than the Misses Collis,\nwho had seen Billy. In view of this, M. R. H. and\nU. V. T. went to Boscombe, on April 10th, 1917. On\nApril 11th, they called on the Misses Collis. They\nwere only able to see one of the Misses Collis, namely,\nthe writer of the letters appended to the above-mentioned\n\flxxviii.] Knoivledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 501\nsitting of Dec. 13th, 1916, the other Miss Collis being in\nquarantine owing to measles.\nM. E. H. and U. V. T. talked to Miss Collis about\nBilly, visiting his grave, etc., maintaining always that\ntheir interest in his symptoms had been aroused owing\nto a very vivid dream. This was the explanation given\nby U. V. T. in the first instance, when she wrote to Miss\nCollis, as it was unfortunately thought necessary to sup-\npress the truth for the time being, in order to avoid\ncreating a bias.\nDuring this call they were unable to get any infor-\nmation beyond that which Miss Collis had already given\nin her letters. Miss Collis mentioned, however, that Billy\nhad a very beautiful, silky coat, which was rather inter-\nesting in view of the fact that A. V. B. had remarked\non his coat through Feda. Unfortunately a certain curate,\nformerly a guest at the Misses Collis 's house, who had\nknown Billy well, was found to have left Boscombe, so\nhis testimony could not be obtained.\nMiss Collis, however, kindly supplied the name and\naddress of the Veterinary Surgeon who had attended Billy\nprior to his death, and who had finally destroyed him,\nat Miss Collis 's request.\nUpon leaving Miss Collis's house, M. R. H. and U. V. T.\ndrove to the address of the Veterinary Surgeon, Miss Dutton,\nof Boscombe, where they saw this lady's mother, Miss\nDutton being out. It happened that Miss Dutton's services\nwere required for U. V. T.'s present dog, who was with\nthem. They asked, therefore, that Miss Dutton should call\nat their hotel on the following morning.\nOn April 12th, 1917, Miss Dutton called at the Linden\nHall Hydro at 11.30 a.m., and after an examination of\nthe dog's eye, in which he had a cold, had been made,\nU. V. T. introduced the subject of Billy, by telling Misa\nDutton that Billy had belonged to her, up to eleven\nyears ago, and that her father had been very devoted\nto him. Miss Dutton did not appear to know that the\ndog had ever belonged to U. V. T. It was evident that\nshe remembered Billy merely as Miss Collis's dog and as\na very bad case.\n\f502 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nU. V. T. then introduced the subject of the dream,\nwhich she said had been of a very vivid kind, and had\ndealt with Billy's recent ailments. She said that she had\nbeen sufficiently interested to write to Miss Collis on the\nsxibject, and much surprised to hear from that lady that\nnearly every detail that she had dreamt was correct.\nMiss Dutton expressed interest, and fully confirmed aU the\ndetails that had previously been confirmed by Miss Collis,\nafter they had been carefully enumerated to Miss Dutton\nby U. V. T.\nMiss Dutton was especially clear regarding the lump\non Billy's leg, giving details regarding it and its exact\njwsition high up in front of the fore leg. This particular\nlump, or as Feda calls it, \" knobbly thing,\" had apparently\nbeen of sufficient dimensions to have remained in her\nmemory, as in that of Miss Collis's sister, and of Miss\nCollis herself.\nU. V. T. told Miss Dutton that, in view of her having\ndreamt that Billy was in an unusually unhealthy condition\nonly for a short time prior to his death, she had naturally\nbeen interested to learn from Miss Collis's letter, that\nhe had received, a few weeks prior to his death, a bite\non his back from another dog, which bite, it was feared,\nwould not heal. U. V. T. asked Miss Dutton whether\nthere had really been any reason to suppose that this\nbite would not heal ; to which Miss Dutton replied\nthat although the bite had been received three weeks or\nso before Billy's final removal, so far from healing it had\nbeen in a very bad condition from the first, having\nrapidly become mortified ; and she went on to say that\nthe smell of the wound had been so offensive that it\nwas unpleasant having to dress it, which she had done\ndaily, the dog being brought to her by a servant.\nHaving ascertained this much, M. R. H. and U. V. T.\nexpressed their interest, and U. V. T. remarked that\napparently the only erroneous detail in her dream had\nbeen that someone had picked up Billy's feet to look\nbetween the toes, which proceeding he much disliked,\nwhereas Miss Collis stated in her letter that neither she\nnor her sister could remember ever having done so. To\n\flxxviii.] Knoivledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 503\nthis Miss Dutton rejoined instantly :\n\" Oh ! but I did ;\nhe had pustules between his toes, and the examination\nmust have hurt him.\"'\nAfter all the details above given had been verbally\nobtained, M. R. H., who had been present throughout\nthe interview, told Miss Dutton that she and U. V. T.\nwere both interested in the investigation of dreams. She\nasked Miss Dutton whether she would be willing, therefore,\nto give a written statement regarding Billy's symptoms.\nMiss Dutton replied that she was quite willing to do so, and\nasked if she should write it from memory, or go home\nand look at her ledger, in which all her cases were recorded.\nM. R. H. and U. V. T. requested that she should go home\nand examine her ledger before putting the statement in\nblack and white.\nWe think that the above account sets forth quite\nclearly our mode of procedure in order to ascertain the\nfacts regarding Billy's ailments. We received Miss Dutton's\nwritten statement on April 14th, 1917. It ran as follows :\nJohn Dutton,\nCanine and Feline Specialist.\nRe Miss Collis's Terrier \" Billy.\"\nI found the \"Terrier,\" after examining and treating same,\nsuffering from as follows :\nPustules between toes caused from old age.\nLump on top of right front leg caused from acute\nRheumatism.\nBite on back, shortly before death, the which was\nmortifying and in a very bad state.\n(Signed) (Miss) G. C. Dutton,\nCanine and Feline Specialist.\nApril 13th, 1917.\nThus it will be seen that four points regarding \" Billy's\n\"\ncondition prior to his death, were given by A. V. B.\nthrough Feda, which were entirely unknown to either\nLady Troubridge or myself at the time when they were\n\f504 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\ngiven. All these four points were subsequently verified\nby one or more persons as follows :\n1. That Billy was not in a specifically unhealthy state\nfor very long prior to his death. This point was\ntestified to by Miss Collis in her own name and her\nsister's, and by Miss Dutton.\n2. That Billy had something the matter with his hind\nleg, or his foot. This was corroborated by Miss\nCollis, on her sister's behalf and her own.\n3. That Billy had a knobbly thing sticking out on one\nof his legs. This fact was clearly remembered by\nboth the Misses Collis and Miss Dutton.\n4. That they would turn Billy's feet up and examine\nbetween the toes, a proceeding which he did not\nlike. Neither of the Misses Collis had any know-\nledge of such a thing having been done, whereas\nMiss Dutton clearly remembered the fact of having\ndone it herself, and of its having been painful to\nthe dog.\nThe next reference to Billy occurred on March 9th,\n1917, at a sitting taken by me, acting as my own re-\ncorder. I was curious to know why and how A. V. B.\nhad hit upon Billy as a test. On this occasion, therefore,\nI introduced the subject myself, and although the ex-\ntract we are about to give is devoid of evidential value,\nwe think that it is not altogether without interest. The\nextract is as follows :\nM. R. H. (To A. V. B.) And now I want to ask a question.\nHow did you meet Billy, and how did you know\nthat he was Una's Billy ?\nF. She says : \" Well, I must tell you that I was\nhelped about Billy ; you know I told you that I\nhad seen him, but I got to know in a very round-\nabout way about that leg of his. You see I'm\nnot clever enough to get a thing like that through\nwithout help, a thing from an animal mind.\nHad Billy been a person, I could have asked\nhim, or have tapped his intelligence ; but I think\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 505\nthat the minds of two people who were helping\nme on this side were able to interpret that part\nfor me. In some strange way that I don't under-\nstand yet, they Avere able to tap the minds of\npeople on earth, who knew about that leg, and\nthey were also able to tap for me Billy's own\nmemory. I suppose it is admissible to speak\nabout a dog's memory. In any case this was\ndone for me, in order that I might give that\ntest.\"\nM. R H. But how could you have known that Billy was\nBilly ?\nF. She says :\n\" That is difficult to explain, I can only\ntell you that an understanding of facts of that\nkind occasionally comes to one over here, not\nalways. I suppose, in this case, there must have\nbeen some sort of link between Billy and Una\nand you and myself, if only from the point of\nview of something that would be of interest.\nI don't know how those things come to one,\nbut they do, and I found myself somehow auto-\nmatically in touch with Billy. We have a far\nfuller knowledge of things here than I can ever\nhope to explain to you through Feda, it's much\ntoo big a thing to get through one brain.\"\nM. R. H. Have you actually got Billy, then ?\nF. She says :\n\" Yes, I have, and you may ask why\nI have. I think because Billy was a link and\nit was extremely useful to have Billy, in order\nto get that test through.\"\nWith this concludes the Billy incident. Since the\nsitting of March 9th, 1917, the dog's name has been\nmentioned by A. V. B. once or twice, but only as having\nbeen the subject of an excellent test. Before leaving the\nincident, however, we feel it incumbent upon us to\napologise to Miss Collis and Miss Dutton for the little\ndeception we felt it necessary to practice on them, and\nwe sincerely hope that in the unlikely event of this paper\never falling into their hands they will find it in their\n\f506 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nhearts to forgive us, and will realise how necessary it is\nin such a matter to avoid any statement that might\ncreate a bias. We have not hesitated to use the correct\nnames, in this instance, as no personal family matters\nwere under discussion.\nOur grateful thanks are due to both the ladies in question\nfor the sympathetic and helpful attitude they displayed\ntowards our enquiries.\n(See Appendix B.)\nWe will now deal with an extract from a sitting of\nDecember 20th, 1916, I took the sitting and Lady Trou-\nbridge acted as the recorder. I had been asked by\nA. V. B.'s daughter to put a certain question to A. V. B.\nAs neither Lady Troubridge nor myself knew the answer,\nit was considered that it would be a good test. The\nfollowing is the extract :\nM. R. H. [A. V. B.'s daughter] has asked me to ask her a\nfew questions, but never mind if the conditions\naren't good to answer them.\nF. She says, yes, you can ask them.\nM. R. H. Well, ask her does she remember Dick Rogers [pseu-\ndonym] .\nF. She says, in answer to that, that it was a long\ntime ago.\nM. R. H. Does she remember a place where Dick Rogers\nlived, called Burnham [pseudonym] ?\nF. She doesn't say anything about that gentleman,\nDick Rogers, nothing at all, she only tells Feda\nabout a rather old-fashioned house ; it looks to\nFeda like an old house, not a large house, though,\nit looks like a big cottage ; are you sure she\nreally knew Dick Rogers ?\nSection II. Concerning \" Burnham.\nM. R H. Yes.\nV. Well, she says it was a long time ago, and it\nseems to Feda as though she knew more about\nthe house than about the man, she says he's\nnot over there.\n\flxxviil] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 507\nM. R. H. Not in the spirit world. No, I don't think so.\nF. No, and she hadn't seen him for a long time.\nM. R. H. Ask her, can she remember what kind of animals\nthey were, that this Dick Rogers kept in a cage\nin the garden at Burnham.\nF. Feda will try and get it, Feda feels that it is to\ndo with the old-fashioned house that she is\nshowing, which has a roof that goes up and down.\nM. R. H. You don't mean the cottage, do you ?\nF. No, but there is a cottage in connection with that\ngentleman, but this is a larger house.\nM. R. H. What [A. V. B.'s daughter] wants to know is about\nthe animals kept in a cage.\nF. Yes, she remembers, she remembers they were not\nvery close to the house. You might be close\nto the house and not see them unless you looked\nfor them. And in addition to the cages, and\nnear to them, there was a kind of little out-\nbuilding. She's leading up to telling you, she's\ntrying, (sotto voce : can't you tell Feda ?) She\nsays they made a noise, (sotto voce : do you\nmean a squeak ?) As near as Feda can get it\nshe says they made a squeaky noise. And now\nshe's trying to show Feda something that sticks\nup across the cage, it doesn't stick up quite\nstraight, it slants in a way from corner to\ncorner (here Feda indicates what might be\ntaken for a pole or branch slanting upwards and\ncrossways) ; she says it isn't quite a cage in the\nordinary sense of the word, not just wirework like\na bird cage, it's made too solidly for that, she\nsays, and she says that there used to be two\ncages not only one cage. She's not sure that\nthere were always two, but there had been at\none time. It seems to Feda as though some-\nthing dropped from the top of the cage to the\nground, Feda saw something dark drop, and now\nthere's a sort of scratching noise, but she calls\nit a screechy, squeaky noise as well, but Feda\ncan't quite get from her what that is. She\n\f508 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nhadn't seen Dick Rogers for a long time before\nshe passed on.\nM. R. H. True.\nF. And she doesn't think [A. V. B.'s daughter] had either.\nM. R. H. That's quite true too.\nF. She says he was very unusual in some ways, and\nthat he had a lot of books, too ; not ordinary\nbooks that you read, like novels, but books upon\na particular subject ; a collection of books on\nsome life away from here altogether, away from\ncivilization ;\nsomething he evidently took an\ninterest in. And he was interested in the people\nwho had to do with that kind of life. He had\nsomething hanging on the walls too, long shaped\nthings, but not pictures. She says they were\nnot all long shaped, but the ones she's showing\nFeda on the wall are long shaped. Oh ! she says\none thing he had got there had been dried.\nIt's nothing to do with pictures.\nM. R. H. All right Feda, we've got that down.\nF Then there's a room that she seems interested in,\nit's not at the front of the house but at the\nback, it's a corner room at the back, a room that\nhe was very fond of being in. It had shelves\nin it and a kind of case, not a cupboard, it's\nnot built into the wall, it stands out. She says\nhe had some glass cases with something inter-\nesting in them, she knows of two cases, not this\ncupboard thing but smaller ones ; oh ! and he\nused to have several big books ;\nyou opened\nthem and you could pull out pieces of stiff paper\nwith things on them, not writing, some kind of\ndesign or drawing. It seems to Feda that they\nwere loose, because you can pull them out ; and\nshe says do you know if [A. V. B.'s daughter]\nwould remember a very old chest that he had ?\nM. R. H. I will ask her.\nF. She can't say more now about the thing in a cage.\nIt wasn't a usual thing, it was something out of\nthe ordinary, that's all she can say about him now.\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 509\nWe must first state that in the above extract the correct\nnames have been disguised by request. Sir Richard Rogers,\nas we have called him, was an old friend of A. V. B.'s,\nhe is entirely unknown to Lady Troubridge, and I myself\nhave only had the pleasure of meeting him on, I think,\ntwo occasions, some years ago. At the time of this sitting\nSir Richard was in Egypt.\nThe first thing I did after the sitting was to consult\nA. V. B.'s daughter. She told me that the animal in\nthe cage, which she had hoped would be mentioned, was\na bear. Now there does not appear to be anything in\nFeda's description applicable to a bear, except the\nscratching noise, the branch or pole indicated (for\nalthough Sir Richard in his answer does not mention this,\nas will be seen later, a bear's cage usually contains some-\nthing of the sort), the solidity of the cage, and possibly\nthe final remark to the effect that the cage contained an\nunusual sort of animal. It would almost appear as\nthough some other animals or birds had been shown to\nFeda. It would seem, however, as if towards the end\nof the extract A. V. B. had remembered some single\nanimal ; because in my original question I spoke of\nanimals in the plural, but A. V. B., speaking through\nFeda, says that she cannot say more about the thing\nin a cage, thereby indicating the singular.\nA. V. B.'s daughter was unable to be of much assist-\nance to me, as she had not, I understood, been to\nBurnham (pseudonym) since she was a child, and could not\nremember any of the objects mentioned. Some of the points\nI myself knew to be correct, and we will deal with these\nfirst. I knew it was correct when Feda said that\nA. V. B. had not seen the gentleman in question for a\nlong time ; the last occasion upon which she saw him\nwas, to the best of my belief, when we lunched together\nwith him several years ago. I knew, however, that at\none time A. V. B. and her husband had been in the\nhabit of staying with Sir Richard at Burnham, and\nthat in those bygone days they saw a good deal of him,\nand were intimately acquainted with the house ;\nalthough\nFeda's supposition that A. V. B. knew more about the\n\f510 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nhouse than the man was wrong. During all the years\nthat A. V. B. and I lived together Sir Richard was\nseldom in residence at his house, I think ; or if he was,\nwe did not meet him, except as I have said upon about\ntwo occasions. I also knew that it was correct when\nFeda stated that A. V. B.*s daughter had not seen him\nfor a long time either.\nThe old house which was given in connection with him,\nand which appeared to Feda to look like a big cottage,\nI placed at once, as I remembered that Sir Richard had\nwritten to A. V. B. on one occasion saying that, as\nBurnham was let, he was living in a Manse on his\nproperty. I had also seen a photograph of the exterior\nof Burnham itself, from which I was able to gather that\nFeda's remarks regarding the roof of that house were\ncorrect. I knew also that Sir Richard had some sort of\nan aviary at Burnham. When I lunched with him\nat his hotel he showed me a tame bullfinch, with\nwhich he apparently travelled about ; and it was then\nthat he told me that he kept a great many birds at his\nplace in the country. Sir Richard and I had found a\ncongenial topic of conversation in our mutual love of\nbirds. He did not mention any other pets, however,\nnor had I ever heard of them from A. V. B. In speaking\nof his birds Sir Richard did not give me any details\nregarding the position of the cages or aviaries at Burnham.\nIt appeared wise, however, to be quite sure that my\nmemory on these points had been accurate, and I was\nfortunately able to verify them later on, with Sir Richard's\nassistance. With the points above mentioned my know-\nledge of Burnham ended. I have never entered the\nhouse, or been, to the best of my belief, in its vicinity,\nnor have I ever heard a description of its interior from\nA. V. B. During our long friendship she never went\nthere, and beyond telling me on one occasion, the occasion\nI think when we lunched with Sir Richard, that Burnham\nwas a beautiful place, having pine woods near it, I cannot\nremember having heard her mention it.\nI wrote to Sir Richard in Egypt, and in that letter\nI was very careful not to give him the least intimation\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 511\nthat there was any question of communication between\nmyself and A. V. B. I wrote of a clairvoyant who had\ndescribed to me a person resembling Sir Richard, and\nhad given me details regarding what might possibly be\nhis house. It was unpleasant having to use subterfuge,\nbut as in the case of the \" Billy Incident \" it appeared\nabsolutely essential not to create a bias. Wishing to\nsave Sir Richard all possible trouble, and at the same\ntime to obtain clear answers, I enclosed in my letter\neight question sheets ;\nupon each of these sheets was\nwritten a separate question, space being left beneath it\nfor an answer. We will give the questions and answers\nexactly as they stand, the names alone being altered.\nThe original question sheets with their answers are in\nour possession. We will begin with the confirmation of\nthose points already known to me at the time of the\nsitting, two fully and one partially.\nQuestion 1.\nIs the roof of Burnham gabled, or has it turrets ?\nCan it in fact be considered up and down, and not flat\nin any way ?\nAnswer.\nThe roof is all up and down, and gabled and turreted,\nnot flat in any way.\nQuestion 2.\nHas Sir Richard lived since the War, or at some\nprevious time, in any farm, lodge, or cottage, on or near\nhis estate ?\nAnswer.\nYes, for some months in the Manse of B., about two\nmiles from Burnham, because the shooting was let when\nthe War broke out, and I could not get into Burnham\nfor some weeks or months.\nQuestion 3.\nWere there ever any cages in the garden at Burnham,\nand if so, how many ? Were these cages unseen from\n\f512 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nthe house and surrounding garden ? Was there any kind\nof shed or out -building near them ? Was there a slanting\nbranch or pole of any kind in one of these cages ? What\nkind of birds, animal, or animals were kept in a cage\nor cages ?\nAnswer.\nMany cages, but not in the garden, in the Park, all\nunseen from the house or garden, many out-buildings\nalso, at the kennels near the cages. A pole or poles\nin the eagle's cage. Golden eagle, owls, hawks, falcons,\nin one lot of aviaries. Golden and silver pheasants in\nothers. Also a bear, and ferrets near his cage. I think\nalso at one time, monkeys ; the scratching noise might be\nmade by ferrets.\n(It will have been noticed that Sir Richard tells us that\nthe cages were in the park and not in the garden, and\nit must be also noticed that the suggestion that the cage\nin question was in the garden at Burnham emanated from\nthe wording of A. V. B.'s daughter's question, and not\nfrom Feda. Sir Richard refers to the scratching noise\nwhich was not alluded to in my question, but in an\naccompanying letter. We now come to those questions,\nthe answers to which were entirely unknown to us at the\ndate of the sitting.)\nQuestion 4.\nDid any things hang on the walls at Burnham that\nwere not pictures, that were some of them long in shape,\nand one of which had at one time been dried, if so,\nwhat ?\nAnswer.\nMany things, weapons, shields and stuffs from the\nSoudan and elsewhere, many of them long in shape.\nAlso a dried crocodile from the Nile.\nQuestion 5.\nWas there, or is there.fany particular room used by\nSir Richard, which room is a corner room, towards the\n\flxxvhi.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 513\nback of the house ? Did or does it contain a case like\na cupboard which is not built into the wall ? Are\nthere any smaller glass cases anywhere containing articles\nof interest ? Were there shelves in this room ?\nAnswer.\nMy smoking room was at the back of the house, there\nwere in this room cupboards under the bookcases, but it\nwas hardly a corner room. A glass case containing\nEgyptian antiquities is in the vestibule.\nQuestion 6.\nHad Sir Richard any designs or sketches, or plans of\nany kind, which were kept on loose sheets of paper in a\nbook or portfolio ?\nAnswer.\nYes, portfolio, containing plans of buildings and sketches.\nQuestion 7.\nHad Sir Richard any collection of books on some\nsubject pertaining to distant life or peoples of a semi-\ncivilized nature, in which Sir Richard was or is interested ?\nAnswer.\nYes, books on Central Africa and earfy travels in Egypt\nand the Soudan.\nQuestion 8.\nHad Sir Richard in his possession an old chest of any\nkind ?\nAnswer.\nYes,r\nan old Italian Cassone.\nThis is the end of the first batch of questions and\nanswers which I sent to and received back from Sir\nRichard. As we have already said the answers to\nQuestions 1 and 2 were known to me at the time of the\n\f514 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nsitting and only required the corroboration of Sir Richard,\nwhich I obtained ; while something was also known by\nme regarding Question 3.\nFeda does not appear to be able to give anything very\ndefinite regarding the cage and its occupant. The direct\nquestion put by me met with the fate of many direct\nquestions, and drew very nearly blank. The result of\nmy question, however, was curious : it appeared as though\nthe mention of the name \" Dick Rogers,\" coupled with\nBurnham, had touched a spring of memory in the mind\nof the purporting communicator, who, although when asked\na question point-blank, could not for the moment give\nthe correct answer, was nevertheless led by that question\nto remember numerous other things which were in a\nsense connected with it. And regarding the question\nitself, although the answer expected by A. V. B.'s\ndaughter was not obtained, still Feda's description of\nwhat was kept in a cage or cages at Burnham, although\nsomewhat vague, is fairly applicable to several of the pets\nkept by Sir Richard.\nWe find Feda telling us that A. V. B. remembers\nanimals that were not kept close to the house. She says\nyou might be close to the house and not see them unless\nyou looked for them. Sir Richard, in replying to this\npoint, states that the cages were in the Park, and unseen\nfrom the house or garden, and this is the first of the\nstatements regarding those things which were unknown\nto us at the time of the sitting.\nFeda tells us that near those cages there was a kind\nof little out-building, and we find that, according to Sir\nRichard, there must have been such an out-building, as\nhe states that there were out-buildings at the kennels,\nnear the cages, at Burnham.\nFeda tells us that there was more than one cage, two\nperhaps, at one time. From Sir Richard we learn that\nthere were many cages ;\njust here, therefore, Feda's\nstatement might have been more accurate. Incidentally\nwe find A. V. B. remarking, through Feda, that Sir\nRichard was an unusual man, and I know that he is\n\fxxxvni.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 515\nclever and that in some respects he is considered to be\noriginal, and rather out of the ordinary.\nFeda next tells us that he had a lot of books, and she\n'\ndefines these books as being upon a particular subject ;\nshe says that they are books on some life and people\nfar from civilization, in which Sir Richard evidently took\nan interest. To this Sir Richard replies once more in\nthe affirmative, stating that he had a collection of books\non Central Africa, and early travels in Egypt and the\nSoudan.\nFeda next describes things said to be hanging on the\nwalls, which things are long in shape, though not all long\nin shape ;\nthey are, however, nothing to do with pictures,\nand one of them is said to have been dried. To this\nSir Richard replies that he had on the walls weapons,\nshields, etc., many of which were long in shape, and also\na dried crocodile from the Nile.\nWe are next told of a room in which A. V. B. seems\ninterested, a corner room at the back of the house, a\nroom which Sir Richard was fond of ; this room is said\nto have contained shelves, and a kind of case which was\nnot a cupboard and was not built into the wall. We\nlearn from Sir Richard that his smoking-room was at the\nback of the house, though it was not exactly a corner room,\nthat this smoking-room or study contained bookcases,\n\u00a3tnd we shall see later on why this room may have been\ntaken by Feda to be a corner room, and also in all\nprobability why A. V. B. might be interested in it. Feda\nrefers to some glass cases containing objects of interest ;\nshe does not tell us exactly where these cases were, but\nA. V. B., it appears, remembers two of them. Sir Richard\ntells us of one such case which contained . Egyptian\nantiquities, which he says is in the vestibule. We shall\nsee later on that there was more than one case containing\nobjects of interest at Burnham.\nFeda next speaks of what she describes as several\nbig books containing loose sheets of paper which you\ncould pull out, she particularly tells us that writing did\nnot appear on these sheets, but that they contained some\nkind of design or drawing. (We may reasonably suppose.\n\u20222 k\n\f516 Miss Badclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nI think, that when Feda says books in this instance\nportfolios are meant. We noticed on one other occasion\nthat she referred to a portfolio as a kind of book con-\ntaining loose sheets of paper.) Regarding this Sir Richard\ntells us that he had a portfolio containing plans of\nbuildings, and sketches.\nAnd lastly, A. V. B. asks through Feda whether A. V. B.'s\ndaughter remembers a very old chest that was in the\npossession of Sir Richard ;\nand, although she did not\nremember it, Sir Richard replies that he had such a chest,\nan old Italian Cassone.\nThus we have a number of details given regarding the\ninterior of a house never visited by Lady Troubridge or\nmyself, together with indications of the owner's literary\ntastes, of which we had no knowledge, and mention is\nmade of certain sketches and designs contained in a\nportfolio.\nAll this appeared to us to be interesting at the time,\nbut there arose the question, suggested by Miss Newton, the\nSecretary of the Society for Psychical Research, as to whether\nor no there was any reason for supposing that A. V. B.\nhad ever seen the things mentioned, or taken any interest\nin them, and might therefore be presumed to have retained\na memory of them. Acting upon Miss Newton's sugges-\ntion I again wrote to Sir Richard in Egypt, enclosing a\nfresh batch of question papers, as in addition to the\npoint raised by Miss Newton there were one or two other\npoints we wanted cleared up. This time I enclosed the\nextract from the sitting, and told him quite frankly that\nI was investigating the possibility of communication\nbetween myself and A. V. B. We will again quote the\nquestions and the answers just as they stand, merely\nchanging the names as on the former occasion.\nQuestion 1.\nCan Sir Richard say whether he thinks it probable that\nA. V. B. during her visits to Burnham saw the trophies,\netc., including the dried crocodile on the wall. Also the\ncages of ferrets, birds, etc., in the park.\n\flxxvih.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 517\nAnswer.\nCertainly A. V. B. saw all the things mentioned in the\nquestion, hundreds of times, she often went to the cages\nin the park to feed the bear with sweets.\nQuestion 2.\nDoes Sir Richard remember whether A. V. B. or her\nhusband ever saw or heard him speak of the sketches\nand plans kept in a portfolio ? Was there more than one\nportfolio containing such things ?\nAnswer.\nYes, the portfolio (I can only think of one, but there\nmay have been more) contained sketches for the alteration\nand decoration of the vestibule where the dried crocodile\nhangs, and I am sure that both A. V. B. and her husband\nsaw the sketches and discussed them.\nQuestion 3.\nWas the collection of books on the Soudan, Central\nAfrica, etc., only one of many collections, or does Sir\nRichard consider it a special collection in which he takes\na special interest ? Can he remember whether he ever\nmentioned these books to A. V. B. or her husband 1\nAnswer.\nThere are many books, but there is a special collection\nof books on Africa, the Soudan, etc. I have no distinct\nrecollection of having mentioned these special books to\nA. V. B., but I think there is no doubt that I did mention\nthem to her, and she probably saw many of them.\nQuestion 4.\nWhy does Sir Richard say that his study can hardly\nbe called a corner room, is it near the corner of the\nhouse in any way ?\n\f518 .Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nAnswer.\nRough plan of part of the house below shows where\nthe study was, the entrance is at the back of the house,\ndrawing-room, etc., look the other way.\n(Here Sir Richard sketched a rough plan of the house,\nshowing that the study was, as stated by Feda, at the\nback of the house. His qualification as to this study\nbeing \" hardly \" a corner room seems to have been\nsuggested by the fact that, although not strictly speaking\na corner room, it juts out beyond the room adjoining it,\nthus forming a distinct angle. In drawing the plan of\nthe study Sir Richard has written across it these words,\n\" Study where the portfolio was.\" Now, if the port-\nfolio was, as stated, in the studj^, and if A. V. B. both\nsaw and discussed the contents of this portfolio, we may\nlogically presume that she may have done so in the\nroom in question ; and that being familiar with the room\nshe would, as Feda says, be interested in it.\nWe only mention this point because it seemed strange\nat first that A. V. B. should have mentioned the study\nor smoke-room as an apartment in which she was inter-\nested, but the fact that the portfolio and some books\nwere kept there appears to make this reference to the\nstudy more intelligible.\nSir Richard's Plan of Burnham is appended.) [See\nAppendix C]\nQuestion 5.\nCan Sir Richard remember more than one glass case\ncontaining objects of interest at Burnham ? He mentions\none in the vestibule containing an Egyptian collection.\nWas there, anywhere in the house, any other glass case,\nor were there any other glass cases, that contained any\nobjects of interest, Egyptian or otherwise ?\nAnswer.\nI cannot remember more than one case containing\nEgyptian antiquities, but many cases containing stuffed\nbirds.\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unhnovm to Sitters. 519\n(It will be remembered that A. V. B. mentioned through\nFeda two cases containing objects of interest, but that\nSir Richard, in an answer to one of my questions in the\nfirst batch, spoke of one case only ; from the later answer\nabove given we see that there were many glass cases\nat Burnham, two of which would appear to have remained\nespecially in the memory of the purporting communicator.\nI put one last question to Sir Richard Rogers, as in\nview of the fact that so many of his replies were in\nthe affirmative we began to fear that Sir Richard, in his\ndesire to be kind, might have been giving certain points\nthe benefit of a doubt. This is the question I put to\nhim therefore.)\nQuestion 6.\nWill Sir Richard give his candid opinion on the extract\nfrom the sitting of December 20th, in view of the com-\nmunications purporting to come from an old friend of\nhis, who knew Burnham ?\nHis answer was as follows :\n\" Some of the remarks\ncertainly seem to apply to Burnham, but they are not\nquite so accurate as might have been expected from an\nold friend who knew Burnham extremely well.\"\nWe think that this frank statement of opinion on Sir\nRichard's part strengthens rather than weakens the\nevidence obtained, since it shows clearly that his frame\nof mind is quite unbiassed, or if bias there be, it certainly\nis not on the side of credulity. We may conclude, there-\nfore, that all the statements which he has confirmed had\nbeen carefully weighed and considered by him. We do\nnot think that Sir Richard has ever been a student of\nPsychical Research, and it is, therefore, quite natural\nthat the enormous difficulties attendant upon the investi-\ngation of phenomena purporting to convey communication\nfrom the dead should be unfamiliar to him. In any case\nI feel deeply indebted to Sir Richard for the trouble and\ncourtesy which he expended on the matter ; without his\nassistance I should have been unable to verify nearly all\nthe statements. There still arises one more point to\n\f520 Miss Raddyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nconsider, namely, whether it is probable that Mrs. Leonard\nmay at any time have seen the interior of Burnham.\nWith this in mind I cabled to Sir Richard, asking if\nBurnham was ever opened to the public. His reply by\ntelegram was \" Rarely.\" In a letter received by me from\nhim at a later date, he referred to my cable, telling me that\nBurnham was very seldom open to the public, and that he\ncould not recollect when last it had been so, but certainly\nnot for some years. He told me that the place had\nbeen let several times during his absence, and that it\nhad occurred to him that it might have been possible for\nfriends and guests of the tenants to have seen the house.\nThis latter possibility we do not think affects Mrs.\nLeonard, as she would not be likely to have seen Burnham\nas a friend or guest of the tenants. With regard to her\nhaving visited it as a sightseer\u2014that also is unlikely, we\nthink, as Burnham is not a show property in the ordinary\nsense of the word. I had never heard of it until I met\nA. V. B., and Lady Troubridge had never heard of it at\nall until I put the question suggested by A. V. B.'s daughter\nat the sitting under consideration. It also appears to us\nthat neither a casual guest of a furnished tenant, nor a\ntourist admitted to view the house, would be likely to\nbe allowed to inspect a special collection of the owner's\nbooks, or to go over the contents of his portfolios.\nHowever, with a view to ascertaining whether Mrs.\nLeonard had ever been in the vicinity of Burnham, I\nintroduced the subject of Scotland, after a sitting on\nApril 18th, 1917. I knew that Mrs. Leonard knew Scotland,\nbecause she had said so on a previous occasion, when,\nhowever, I had not pressed the question, wishing as long\na time as possible to elapse before questioning her closely,\nafter the description of Burnham had been given in trance,\nin order to avoid any association of ideas. On April 18th,\n1917, I introduced the subject by saying that I thought\nof going to a little place called X (here I mentioned the\nname of the station for Burnham) for the summer holidays,\nI asked Mrs. Leonard if she knew whether it was a nice\nplace. Mrs. Leonard replied that she did not know X.\nShe asked me in what part of Scotland it was. I said\n\fLxxvin.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 521\nvaguely that I thought it was North, to which Mrs.\nLeonard replied that she had never been there.\nOn September 5th, 1917, while we were preparing this\npaper, I had a sitting with Mrs. Leonard, and after the\nsitting I again asked Mrs. Leonard whether she had\nbeen to X, the station for Burnham. I mentioned the\ncorrect name, a-nd also asked if she knew a place called\nBurnham, giving again the correct name. She said she\nhad never heard of Burnham, but, as I was anxious to\nbe certain, she wished to ask her husband about the\nstation. I gave her no reason for my question. On\nSeptember 12th, 1917, Lady Troubridge took a sitting, and\nafter the sitting Mrs. Leonard told Lady Troubridge\nthat she had asked her husband about Burnhani and the\nstation in question, and that he said he had never heard\nof Burnham, and also that he had no recollection that\nhe or his wife had ever been to the station X. In fact\nthey were both certain that they never had been to these\nplaces. Mrs. Leonard, we gathered, had only travelled in\nScotland with her husband, and we have no reason to\ndoubt Mr. or Mrs. Leonard's veracity.\nSection III. Concerning Daisy's Second Father.\nWe have now arrived at the last of those incidents\nselected by us as being worthy of special notice. The\nextracts that we are about to give concern a lady whom\nLady Troubridge did not know personally, and although\nthis lady has been a friend of mine for many years, I\nhave seen very little of her, she having been out of\nEngland for long periods together. She has already been\nreferred to in the extract from the sitting of February 21st,\n1917, as Daisy. (See above, p. 471.) At her request her\nname, and those of other individuals mentioned, are dis-\nguised. It may be as well to state the circumstances which\nled up to the incidents about to be considered.\nDaisy Armstrong lost her husband in the War ; she\nwas, and still is, almost entirely unacquainted with\nPsychical Research. Prior to leaving England for the\nNear East she had had two anonymous sittings with an\n\f522 Miss Raddyffe-Hall and Lady Trowbridge. [PART\"\nobscure medium, obtaining no results on the first occasion\nat which I was present, and but very scanty results on\nthe second. She was alone on this last occasion, but.\nassures me that she gave nothing away. I believe this\nto be the case, as I noticed how careful she was at her\nfirst sitting, and I have since taken notes for her\nat Mrs. Leonard's, and have found her an admirably discreet\nsitter. During the early weeks of 1917, Daisy wrote to\nme from the Near East asking me if I would try and\nobtain through Mrs. Leonard some evidence with regard\nto her husband. I replied immediately, promising to do\nmy best, but pointing out the difficulties of a proxy\nsitting and telling her that I would await a favourable\nopportunity before mentioning her wishes to the pur-\nporting communicator, A. V. B., who had both known\nand liked Daisy during her lifetime. At the time of\nwriting I had not decided upon any special date for\nmaking my experiment ;\nconsequently, Daisy could have\nhad no idea when the subject would be broached at Mrs.\nLeonard's.\nA few days after I had posted my letter I happened\nto have a sitting with Mrs. Leonard, namely, on February\n14th, 1917. Lady Troubridge was recording, and I enquired\nof Feda whether the purporting communicator, A. V. B.,\nremembered an old friend of mine called Daisy, who had\nstayed with us in the country when A. V. B. was ill.\nThe following is the record of my questions and of the\nensuing dialogue :\nM. R. H. I think she's [A. V. B.] rather confused this morning,\nbut I am going to ask her a question. I want to\nknow whether she remembers an old friend of\nmine called Daisy, who came to stay with us\nin the country after Ladye was ill ?\nF. She can remember Daisjr, hut she says Daisy's\nnot with her.\nM. R. H. No, that's right.\nF. She's not with Ladye. Ladye says Daisy is con-\nnected with somebody whose name begins with a,\nround letter, it's not an 0, it's a C or a G.\n\fLxxvm.] Knowledge of Matters unknoivn to Sitters. 523\nM. R. H. I don't place that letter.\nF. Wait a minute she's got some word she's trying\nto get through. It isn't an ordinary kind of\nname at all (here Feda gave a sotto voce rehearsal\nof attempts at Daisy's surname, which she gave\nquite correctly twice).\nM. R. H. (to A. V. B.) All right, what Feda has said is quite\ncorrect, and you understand which Daisy it is.\nF. Yes, she does, certainly.\nM. R. H. I Avant to know if she's met anyone on her side-\nwho is connected with Daisy. And I want to\nbe very careful not to say anything myself that\nmay spoil any proofs that come through for\nDaisj'.\nF. She says :\n\" Yes, I have, but, you understand, not\nsoon after I passed over.\" There is some reason\nwhy she wouldn't meet them soon after she\npassed over, their ways lay differently.\nM. R. H. But she has met them 1\nF. Yes, she has.\nM. R. H. This is for Daisj^ and not for me, and that is why\nI cannot speak openly. Can she give me some\ndescription so that I am sure that we are thinking\nof the same person ?\nF. (sotto voce to A. V. B. : A lady did you say, are you\nsure it's a lady ?) She has met a lady connected\nwith Daisy, but that lady passed on befcre Ladye\ndid. She has met someone else as well, and she\nsays :\n\" I saw the lady first \" ; this other one isn't\na lady at all, Feda doesn't know why Ladye\nbrings her in, as she is not the most important.\nShe passed over long ago, but afterwards Ladye\nmet a gentleman whom she says Daisy knows\nquite well ; and Ladye thinks she could get more\nthrough about him if you would give her time,\nbut she says : \"It's never so good if I try too\nmuch.\"\nM. R. H. No. Did she know him on the earth plane or not ?\nF. She says it teas the one she knew on the earth\nplane.\n\f524 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nM. R. H. Does she think she could see him ?\nF. She says : \"I'll try ; I got that name through\nbecause you weren't expecting it, I am clever\nsometimes.\"\n.H. R. H. Daisy is very anxious to obtain a message, and it\nwould be most charitable if Ladye would help.\nF. She says :\n\" I will try, because someone else is just\nas anxious to get a message through to Daisy\nas Daisy to him, and I'll try and push something\nthrough about him.\" And she kno-ws which\nDaisy it is.\nM. R. H. Yes, because she gave me a name.\nF. Yes, she's cleverer at names than anyone.\nHaving got thus far we did not write to Daisy, as we\nwere desirous of keeping her mind off the subject as\nmuch as possible, and were most anxious that she should\nnot know the dates on which sittings which concerned\nher were talcing place. A week later, on February 21st,\n1917, I took a sitting alone, acting as my own recorder.\nI was scarcely expecting to obtain any reference to\nDaisy's affairs, yet the sitting had not progressed very\nfar before a spontaneous allusion to Daisy was made by\nFeda.\nThe beginning of this reference we have already given\nin the section of this paper dealing with knowledge of\ncontemporary events, when treating of what appeared to\nbe a prophetic statement on the part of A. V. B. re-\ngarding my seeing Daisy. After that statement, which,\nas will be remembered, came true, A. V. B. said through\nFeda that Daisy had gone north and come south again,\nand that that happened a little time ago ; she thought it\nmight have been a few weeks ago.\nThe statement regarding a few weeks is incorrect. We\nsubsequently learned from Daisy that she had made no\nexcursion from where she was at the time of the sitting,\nwhich had taken her north and south. This reference,\nhowever, reminded her of her journey out, which had been\ninterrupted by the ship's calling at Mudros after leaving\nNaples. Had A. V. B. said through Feda that this going\n\fLxxvm.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 525\nnorth and then south on Daisy's part, had been accom-\nplished some months ago instead of some weeks ago,\nthe reference would have been interesting. As it is it\nis not entirely devoid of interest. Peculiarly poignant\ncircumstances were connected with Mudros for Daisy,\nwhose ship, going out of its usual course, stopped there\nquite unexpectedly on the exact date upon which her\nhusband's ship had called at that port when he was on\nhis way to the Front one year previously.\nWe will now take up the extract from the sitting of\nFebruary 21st, 1917.\nF. Now Feda wonders if she's getting mixed, because\nshe's speaking of the sea in connection with Daisy,\nand it's not a little bit of sea like it would be\nif you were going to France\u2014it's not like a\nChannel crossing. She is speaking of a big lot\nof water, many, many miles by sea, she says.\nWait a minute, now she says something about\nDaisy lost someone. She says did Daisy lose\ntwo people\u2014one of them rather lately, and one\nof them two or three years ago ? Because your\nLadye says she's been looking about since you\nwere here last time, and she's got into touch\nwith them. But all this is very difficult to get\nthrough, she says, because she is so anxious to\ndo it.\nM. R. H. Tell her to take her time.\nF. (To A. V. B. : Are they both men ?) She says they\nare both men, and that one of them is a man\nwho is not young, a man in the prime of life.\nFeda can see him.\nM. R. H. Is he here then ?\nF. Yes.\nM. R. H. Well, tell him I am ready to give up the morning\nto anything he wishes to say.\nF. Feda sees a man in the prime of life, he is about\nmedium height, perhaps on the tall side ; but this\nis difficult to judge because Feda can't see his\nlegs. He seems to be broad across the chest and\n\f526 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nshoulders. He has rather a habit of throwing\nhis shoulders back and sticking his stomach out.\nHe used to put his hand in his pocket. He has\nrather a good-shaped face, broad across the\ncheek-bones, and the lower part of the face looks\nrounded. He's got a brownish moustache, yet\nnow, when Feda looks again, that moustache is\nnot there.\nM. R. H. I don't quite understand ; is he showing hair on his\nface this morning ?\nF. Oh ! Mrs. Twonnie, when Feda said just now that\nthe lower part of his face seemed rounded, Feda\nsees that it was not his chin that comes round\nlike that ; now it looks like a beard, but not a\nlong one ; it seems to surround his chin and is\nnot straggly. He's got a nose that shows the\nbridge, and then curves in a little at the end ;\nthe tip curves downward (here Feda indicates a\nsmall aquiline nose). The nose is not broad\nacross the bridge but broadens at the nostrils.\nHe is so afraid he's not getting this description\nclear.\nM. R. H. Tell him to take heart and cheer up.\nF. Feda can't see his eyes very well, but they don't\nlook big, and they're rather twinkly ; the colour\nseems to be mixed\u2014hazel perhaps ; Ins eyebrows\nare broadly marked ;\nthey are more straight than\narched, but they bend round a little at the\nextreme end ;\nthey look browny.\nM. R. H. Would he like to give any message to Daisy ?\nF. He wants to give a description first ; he's got a\nsquare forehead, and it looks to Feda as though\nthe hair receded on the temples, or else it is that\nhe brushes it back very much. He wears a soft\nsort of hat ; Feda doesn't think it's a cap with a\npeak, it looks like a hat with a brim, and the\nbrim seems to be turned up more one side than the\nother. He's showing a suit that he thinks Daisy\nwould recognise ; it's a sort of browny coloured\nsuit, and has what looks like a check pattern,\n\fxxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 527\nbut it's a mixed-up pattern, not a decided check,\nand there seem to be other shades in it as well\nas brown. He once had a whole suit of that sort,\nbut sometimes he would wear something light\ninstead of the waistcoat that belonged to the\nsuit. He is making Feda feel that he has travelled\na good deal,\u2014not always stuck in one place, and\nthat when he passed on he had an awfully choky\nfeebng in the throat. You know, Mrs. Twonnie,\nFeda doesn't think that he had been well for\nsome time before he passed on, though she\ndoesn't mean that he had always been awfully\nill. He looks like a very kind man, but a man\nof the world ; he was kind, but very obstinate\nsometimes. Your Ladye's been helping him, he\nsays. Since you were here last time she says\nshe's seen quite a lot of him. She says :\n\" Isn't\nit funny ?\n\" He's trying to show Feda how\nawfully obstinate he would be sometimes with\nregard to anytliing that was for his own good.\nHe thinks Daisy will recognise that. Now Feda\ndoesn't know about this, it's not clear, but he\nseems to be trying to tell her about something\nto do with the sea in connection with him. It's\nnot living on the sea properly, but it has to do\nwith going over water, and there's some parti-\ncular thing to do with a certain place. He is\nshowing Feda a place with very high buildings ;\nit's curious, because the buildings are so high\nthat they make the street look like an alley\nalmost. The buildings rise up very straight on\neach side of the street.\nM. B. H. Would Daisy know about this ?\nF. He thinks she ought to, because it's connected with\nhim. Now he is speaking of a wide street, a\nstreet that has a budding in the very middle of\nit, and streets that branch on each side from that\nbuilding that is in the middle of the wide street.\nIt goes like this : (here Feda draws with her\nfinger on M. R. H.'s knee, and indicates a straight\n\f528 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nstreet with a building apparently in the middle\nof the road, and two streets branching left and\nright backwards from the building). These streets\nhave got houses in them, no, Feda's not sure\nthat they are only houses, she thinks there are\nshops as well.\nM. R. H. He's getting on very nicely.\nF. You see, he says that he remembers this place that\nhe has just described, this street with the building\nin the middle of it, very well indeed ; he re-\nmembers it so well because he nearly always came\nup that broad street and the building would face\nhim, and he says it nearly always struck his\nattention. Now he's telling Feda that he used\nsometimes to sit at a table and write in jerks.\nHe must be trying to show a house ; there seem\nto have been two rooms, one opening out of the\nother, and he would sit in the second room.\nOh, they're trying to show Feda something which\nis very difficult, it looks as though in one of\nthose rooms there was something almost like a\nmachine, it seems to be on a table ; it's nearly\nall made of some dark-coloured metal. Now Feda\nsees that it looks like rather a big thing on a\nstand ;\nperhaps it is a stand that it was on and\nnot a table. There's like a roily tiling or rod\nrunning through the middle of this machine, and\nthere are two other narrower rods as well, and\nabove the rods something seems to rise up, some-\nthing that looks curved. He says that Daisy\nought to know, as it was something that he used,\nand that even if she has not seen it he must\nhave spoken to her about it.\nM. R. H. I think I recognise him.\nF. He's awfully pleased.\nM. R. H. But of course I should like to have it clearly\ndefined what relation he was to Daisy, but I\ndon't want you to force it.\nF. He won't give it unless he can be sure of it. Feda\ndoesn't know what this means, but he says :\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 529\n\" There were two of us that stood in the same\nrelation to Daisy, but in a slightly different way.\"\nHe says that means something, and he hopes it\nwon't be misunderstood.\nM. R. H. If he can't get it clear, leave it.\nF. But he says those words are quite clear, you can\ntake them absolutely literally. He says :\n\" Two\nof us did stand in the same relation to Daisy,\nwith a slight difference.\" He's so afraid she\nwon't understand his putting it in that way.\nHe says :\n\" Do you follow me ?\n\"\nM. R. H. Yes, I think I do.\nF. He wants you to tell Daisy that he was glad about\neverything she did after his passing ; he considers\nthat she did everything for the best. Now this\nis important : he says that he was worried,\nbecause he felt that he ought to have arranged\nsomething differently. After he had passed on\nhe felt that he had tied her up, limited and\nrestricted her by some condition or some arrange-\nment that he had made. He is very sorry that\nhe did so, he knows that it was a mistake now,\nand that there was nothing to be gained. He\nsays, and now he's speaking to you, Mrs. Twonnie :\n\" I suppose you have gathered that this has got\nto do with financial matters ; do you understand ?\n\"\nM. R. H. No, but Daisy may.\nF. He says Ladj'-e has been good to him, helping him.\nM. R. H. Does he think that he can get anyone else to come\nhere for Daisy ?\nF. He says : \" I think so ;\nyou know I've seen him,\nand it was decided that I should come first,\nas I have, to a certain extent, been able to\nmaster conditions more quickly than he could.\"\nHe's trying to say some name. (Here Feda\nmakes inarticulate sounds). He knows who if\nis you want him to bring, he says it's a much\nyounger man than he is.\nM. R. H. Correct.\n\f530 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nF. He says : \"It's all right, I thought Daisy would\nknow that I should see him.\" And now he\nsays to you, Mrs. Twonnie :\n\" It's funny, I\nnever thought I should be speaking to you in\nthis way, it's most unlooked for, unexpected and\nextraordinary !\n\" He says he has many good\nfriends in the spirit world, but that he finds\nlife there very \u2022\ndifferent to the earth life. Your\nLadye says she doesn't.\nM. R, H. Why is that ?\nF. Because people look at things differently. It's to\ndo with the different way that things appeal to\nus here. This gentleman says he likes it, though.\nOh, he had a stick, Feda thinks it was a walking-\nstick, and that it had been given to him. It\nseems to have a rather pretty, light top to it.\nThe stick is of dark wood, but it seems to have\na light handle, and it impresses Feda that there\nare two different sorts of material used in that\nhandle. He says he does apologise for taking\nup so much time.\nM. R. H. Tell him not to, because I am glad for Daisy.\nF. He says it has been very hard indeed for Daisy,\nWhy does he keep on building up a letter R. ?\nNow he's trying to say something more about\nthat 3\nr oung man. He says that he passed on\nin quite a different manner from Avhat he did\nhimself. Oh, now he's jumping, like your Ladye\ndoes sometimes, and speaking of himself again.\nHe says that he was clean-shaven once, or that\nhe did shave once, only, he says, that people\ndidn't like it very much.\nOn receipt of these numerous details we prepared and\nsent out question papers to Daisy to the Near East.\nWe shall not in this case insert the original question\npapers as Ave did in the case of Sir Richard Rogers, as\nDaisy's answers were rather discursive, and would\nrequire too much space. We shall deal with the whole\nsubject therefore, in narrative form. Of course all\n\fLxxvin.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 531\nthe original correspondence, including question-papers and\nanswers, is in our possession. Certain of the points\ngiven regarding the gentleman with the short beard I\nmyself knew to be correct, and through them I had\nquickly gathered that the purporting communicator was\nDaisy Armstrong's father, Mr. Benson (pseudonym). I had\nmade Mr. Benson's acquaintance about fifteen years ago, he\nwas then living in a small country town, in which\nI had been lent a hunting-box. We met on several\noccasions, though I never saw very much of him ; his\ndaughters became friends of mine, but he was seldom\npresent when I visited them, nor did he, to the best of\nmy memory, visit me more than once, if at all. But his\nappearance has remained in my memory, and I recognised\nseveral details in the descriptions of himself, etc., which he\ngave through Feda during the sitting under discussion.\nThere were certain important points, however, given by\nthis communicator of which I had absolutely no know-\nledge until they were verified by Daisy and her sister\nmany weeks later.\nWhen preparing question-papers pertaining to the sitting\nof February 21st, 1917, we included one or two questions\nalso regarding points which had been mentioned on\nFebruary 14th, 1917 ; we had, as has been stated,\nsuppressed all mention of that sitting until further definite\nevidence had been obtained.\nRegarding the sitting of February 14th, 1917, Daisy\nwas unable to place the lady who was said to have been\nconnected with her, and to have passed over long ago ;\nshe thought that that person might be some female\nrelation, but could not remember any particular female\nrelation who would be likely to retain any great interest\nin her. The letter G, standing for a name with which\nDaisy was said to be connected, was placed by her as\nbeing applicable to either of two people ;\nnamely, to a\nyoung girl whose surname began with G, and who had\ndied unexpectedly the month prior to that sitting of\nFebruary 14th, 1917 ; or to her husband's best man,\nkilled in France, whose Christian name and surname both\nbegan with G. Daisy said that the girl friend would be\n2l\n\f532 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\na good deal connected with her, and in view of a subse-\nquent mention at a later sitting, by a communicator pur-\nporting to be Daisy's husband, of an abbreviation of this\ngirl's Christian name, by which she was always called by\nDaisy and her husband, it would seem likely that she was\nthe person meant on February 14th, 1917. Beyond the fact\nthat I obtained Daisy's surname at that sitting nothing\nvery remarkable occurred on February 14th, 1917.\nThere is, however, one other point worthy of mention :\nwhen A. V. B. was asked whether she had known the\nparticular man connected with Daisy during her lifetime,\nshe replied through Feda in the affirmative, stating that\nhe was the one that she had known, thus clearly implying,\nand correctly so, that although she had personally known\nDaisy's husband, there was another man connected with\nDaisy whom she had not known. This implication of\nA. V. B.'s is further emphasized on February 21st, 1917,\nas we shall see.\nWe will now consider the extract from the sitting of\nFebruary 21st, 1917. To begin with Feda tells us that\nA. V. B. is speaking of the sea in connection with Daisy\n;\nnot a little bit of sea, like a Channel crossing, but many, many\nmiles of sea. This is correct. We next find A. V. B. telling\nus through Feda that Daisy has lost two people, both men,\none of them rather lately, and one of them two or three years\nago. It is correct to say that Daisy has lost two people ;\nher husband and her father are both dead. Her husband\nhad, at the time of this sitting, been dead a little over\na year, but her father had been dead a little over ten\nyears ; she has lost no special person who died two or\nthree years ago. This is a mistake in time again, as\nfrom what subsequently occurred there cannot be any\ndoubt that the husband and the father are the people\nmeant ; both these people are said to be men, one of\nthem a man not young, a man in the prime of life.\nDaisy's father, Mr. Benson, was sixty-three when he died,\nbut according to his daughter he was very vital, and\nmentally the equal of any man in his prime ; in any case\nthis elderly gentleman leaves no manner of doubt regarding\nhis identity.\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge, of Matters unknown to Sitters. 533\nMr. Benson is described as being broad across the chest\nand shoulders ; I recognised this as correct, I also re-\nmembered him as having been rather corpulent, and I\nthought at the time that I recognised his habit, described\nby Feda, of throwing his shoulders back and sticking his\nstomach out. I may also have noticed his habit of\nkeeping his hand in his pocket ; in any case it would\nnot be safe to presume that I had not noticed these\nthings. I asked Daisy whether this description was\ncharacteristic, and she replied in the affirmative ; she also\nconsulted her sister regarding these points, who not only\nconfirmed them but reminded Daisy of a painting of\nthen father in uniform, in which he was represented as\nhaving one hand thrust into his pocket ;\naccording to\nthe sister this habit of thrusting a hand into the pocket\nand squaring the shoulders had been characteristic of\nMr. Benson during practically the whole of his adult\nlife. I cannot remember having seen the portrait, though\nit is possible that I may have done so.\nThe shape of Mr. Benson's face is well described by\nFeda, as is his beard, which surrounded his chin and was\nnot straggly. The nose is particularly well described ;\nin life it very much resembled that of his daughter Daisy.\nThe eyes are also well described, as far as their twinkly\nlook goes and the fact that they were not very big.\nFeda apparently cannot see their colour distinctly, hazarding\na guess that they may be hazel ; as a matter of fact\nthey were blue. The eyebrows are weU described, and\nthe hair, as stated by Feda, grew far back on his forehead.\nWe next come to the mention of a certain soft hat,\nfollowed by the description of a suit ; now I may have\nseen this hat, but my recollection of Mr. Benson is that\nhe wore a cap ; I may also have seen the suit, but that\nis not so important.\nIn Daisy's answer to my question regarding this hat she\nmerely stated that her father had worn such a hat as\ndescribed ; later on, however, her sister amplified this\nby reminding Daisy that such a hat as described had\nbeen in their father's possession for many years, that it\nwent by the name of \" the old hat,\" and that he was in\n\f534 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Tronbridge. [paet\nthe habit of remarking :\n\" You will spoil my afternoon if\nyou won't let me wear the old hat.\" Daisy was able\nto verifv the suit described, at least inasmuch as that\nher father had a fawny-brown suit of Harris tweed with\norange and darker flecks in it ; she described it\nmixture. Feda, as will have been noticed, speaks of\nit as containing colours other than brown, but as being of\na check pattern, but goes on to say that it is a mixed\nup pattern, and not a decided check. With regard to\nthe \" something light \" which, according to Feda, Mr.\nBenson wore occasionally instead of the waistcoat belonging\nto the suit, Ins daughters think that this must refer to\nMr. Benson's shirt-front, as he was in the habit of taking\noff his waistcoat in hot weather. This, I may state,\nwas a habit entirely unknown to me ; I had only seen Mr.\nBenson in the winter time.\nWe next find the communicator making Feda feel that\nhe had travelled a good deal, and the words \" not always\nstuck in one place \" are very characteristic of him. I\ndid not know that he had travelled, but I did know that\nhe had had a passion for moving, being never contented\nin one house or town for long. His daughters were both\nstruck by this remark, and commented on it to me.\nFrom his daughters I afterwards learnt that Mr. Benson\nhad travelled abroad quite a lot in his youth. The\nchoky feehng described in his throat at the time of his\ndeath is correct. Mr. Benson died of angina pectoris,\na fact which was known to me at the time. Feda tells\nus that she gathers that he had not been well for some\ntime before he passed on ; this statement is correct, and\nthe fact that he had for some years suffered much from\nhis heart was also known to me. And just here there\noccurs a comment of A. V. B.'s which further strengthens\nher remark made on February 14th, 1917, alluding\napparently to Daisy's husband as \" the one \" that she\nhad known during her lifetime. In this present sitting,\nafter telling us that she has seen quite a lot of Mr.\nBenson since I was last at Mrs. Leonard's, she says :\n\" Isn't it funny ?\n\" There would have been nothing funny\nabout it had A. V. B. and Mr. Benson known each other\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 535\nduring their lifetime, but point is given to the words by\nthe fact that they had never met this side of the grave.\n:\nMr. Benson tries to show Feda that he was very\nobstinate with regard to things that were for his good.\nI had no idea that Mr. Benson was an obstinate man ;\nas I have said, I only saw him upon a few occasions,\nand his daughters were not in the habit of discussing\ntheir private affairs with me. Daisy, however, recognised\nthis obstinacy at once, as indeed the communicator had\nsaid through Feda that he thought she would.\nMr. Benson next tries to make Feda understand that\nthere was something connected with him that had to do\nwith going over water, some particular thing to do Avith\na certain place.\nI knew nothing at all about this, but was able later\nto ascertain from the daughters firstly that Mr. Benson\nwhen much younger used to go constantly to Canada for\nsalmon fishing, and secondly (and it is to the following\nincident that Daisy and her sister think he is alluding),\nthat many years ago, before Daisy was born, Mr. Benson,\naccompanied by his wife and Daisy's sister, set sail from\nEngland for Canada, with a view to settling there. The\njourney out proved adventurous, an explosion occurred\non the ship, and the family was obliged to return to\nEngland and start afresh. Arrived in Canada, they\nremained there only three months, when the failure of a\nBank in which Mr. Benson had large interests affected\nhis fortunes ; and he, and his wife and child, returned\nonce more to England. Daisy and her sister remember\nthat their father very often alluded to this adventurous\njourney, remarking that he had had tracts of the ground\nupon which Toronto now stands offered to him in those\ndays for a mere song, and that had he only bought\nthem he would have become a very rich man.\nIn connection with this going over water, and this\ncertain place, Mr. Benson shows Feda a street in which\nthe buildings are so high that they make the street look\nalmost like an alley ; these buildings are said to rise\nup very straight on either side of the street. I have\nsince learnt from the daughters that on several occasions.\n\f536 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nduring subsequent trips to Canada, Mr. Benson visited\nNew York, to which city they think the allusion to high\nbuildings refers. I had no idea that Mr. Benson had\never set foot in America, or that he had ever been to\nCanada.\nWe next find him speaking through Feda of a wide\nstreet, in the very middle of which there is a building ;\nhe tells us that streets branch off on each side of this\nbuilding, and that these streets have got houses in them,\nand shops as well. He says that he remembers this\nplace, this particular street with a building in the middle\nof it ; and that the reason why he remembers it so well\nis because he nearly always came up that broad street,\nwhen the building in the middle would face him, nearly always\nstriking his attention. The streets and the building in question\nwere immediately recognised by me as being unmistakably\ncharacteristic of the country town in which Mr. Benson\nwas living at the time when I met him. We are not\nat liberty to give the name of the town, but there are\nnot many like it in England. In the very middle of\nits High Street there stands a beautiful old Market Hall ;\nit is quite unique, and from the back of it to right and\nleft branch other streets, containing shops as well as\nhouses. Daisy and her sister both tell me that while\nliving in that town then father frequently commented\nupon the beauty of the Market Hall, which he passed\nnearly every day.\nWe will now skip a part of the extract, to which we shall\nreturn later, it requires separate treatment and cannot\nbe dealt with just here.\nThe next remark on the part of the purporting com-\nmunicator with which we will deal is that in which he\nsends a message to Daisy, to the effect that he was very\nglad about everything which she did after his passing,\nas he thinks it was all for the best.\nDaisy and I both consider that these words refer to\nher engagement and marriage, which occurred a short\ntime after Mr. Benson's decease. He next tells me that\nafter his death he felt worried regarding some arrange-\nment ; after he passed on, he says, he felt that he had\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknoion to Sitters. 537\nlimited and restricted Daisy by some condition that he\nhad made ; he goes on to express his regret, and to say\nthat he now knows that there was nothing to be gained.\nApropos of this he says to me, \" I suppose you have\ngathered that this has got to do with financial matters,\ndo you understand ?\n\"\nBeing in total ignorance regarding all Mr. Benson's\nfinancial arrangements I did not understand ; nor had\nI ever heard his Will mentioned or discussed, or seen\nit in the papers. In answer to my question, Daisy\nreplied to the effect that her father had left a letter\nfor his Executors, in which he particularly specified that\nit was his earnest wish and desire that when his daughters\ninherited their capital they should themselves tie it up\nin such a manner as to prevent their husbands touching\nit. He laid great stress on this, and Daisy assures me\nthat both she and her sister looked upon his wish as a\nbinding obligation. In Daisy's case there was, as Mr.\nBenson states, nothing to be gained, since Daisy has not\nyet inherited her capital, and her husband is dead.\nWe next find the communicator saying that he knows\nwho it is that I want him to bring, and that it is a\nmuch younger man than himself ;\nwhich, as referring to\nDaisy's husband, is a correct statement. A little later\non Mr. Benson expresses his astonishment at finding him-\nself speaking to me, and says :\n\" It's funny, I never\nthought I should be speaking to you in this way, it's\nmost unlooked for, unexpected and extraordinary.\" Con-\nsidering our very slight acquaintance during Mr. Benson's\nlifetime, and also that I very much doubt whether the\nidea of communication between this state and another\never entered his head, these words seem quite to the point.\nHe next speaks of a walking-stick which had been\ngiven to him ;\napparently he shows it to Feda, who\ntells me that it seems to have rather a pretty light top,\nbut that the stick itself is of dark wood, though it seems\nto her to have a light handle composed of two different\nsorts of material. In reply to my question regarding\nthis stick, Daisy told me that the stick in question was\none which her father was actually carrying when he fell\n\f538 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\ndead in the street. Daisy described this walking-stick\nof her father's as being of dark-brown bamboo cane, the\nhandle being composed of light-coloured horn, with a\nsilver band ; from her I also learnt that this walking-\nstick had been a present to her father from her mother,\nsome thirty years ago.\nI cannot remember ever having seen the walking-stick\nin question ; I asked Daisy's opinion on this point, and\nshe assures me that her father did not make a practice\nof carrying this stick every day in the country. She\ntold me that at the time when I met him in the country\ntown that must be nameless, she is sure that he was\nusing a rough ash stick.\nAt the end of the extract we find Mr. Benson saying\nthat things have been very hard indeed for Daisy.\nWithout going into private details, it is admissible for\nme to say that this statement is correct. Mr. Benson\nbuilds up a letter R which up to the present we have\nbeen entirely unable to place. He tells me that the\ndeath of the young man, presumably Daisy's husband,\noccurred in quite a different manner to his own ; and this\nis true. And at the extreme end of the extract he\nsuddenly says through Feda that he, Mr. Benson, was\nclean-shaven once, or that he did shave once, only people\ndidn't like it much. I have ascertained that, as far as\nhis family can remember, Mr. Benson was never clean-\nshaven, though at one time he had a moustache only.\nWhy he says that people didn't like it much is up to\nthe present moment not apparent.\nWe now return to the interlude which we skipped, and\nwhich, as will have been noticed in the extract, began\nafter the communicator had finished his description of the\nstreet with the building in the middle of it, and ended\njust prior to his request that I should reassure Daisy\nconcerning all that she had done since his death.\nThe interlude in question begins with a mention of some\none, who is said to be the communicator, sitting at a table\nand writing in jerks, and continues with the description\nof some communicating rooms, in one of which there is\nsaid to be some kind of a machine. I did not recognise\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 539\nthe rooms at the time of the sitting, but thought never-\ntheless that they might have been correctly described,\nand that I had forgotten the construction of Mr. Benson's\nhouse. Just here in the sitting it seemed advisable to\nendeavour to get from the communicator some statement\nto the effect that he was Daisy's father. Accordingly I\nasked what relation he was to Daisy, and to my question\nI obtained a reply which completely bewildered me.\nMr. Benson is reported to say :\n\" There were two of us\nthat stood in the same relation to Daisy, but in a slightly\ndifferent way,\" and to remark that this statement of his\n\" means something, and he hopes that it won't be mis-\nunderstood.\" Now to me these words convej^ed nothing ;\nhence my remark that if the thing could not be stated\nclearly it had better be left. But my suggestion was\nignored, as will have been noticed, and the communicator\nsays emphatically through Feda :\n\" Those words are quite\nclear, you can take them absolutely literally, two of us\ndid stand in the same relation to Daisy, with a slight\ndifference \" ; he also expresses a fear lest Daisy should not\nunderstand his putting it in that way, concluding with the\nwords :\n\" Do you follow me ? \"\nI sent the extract to Daisy together with the question-\npapers previously referred to, and received them back\nfrom her in due course with a letter, from which we will\ngive an extract ; the names and addresses have been changed,\notherwise it is unaltered.\nExtract from Mrs. Armstrong's Letter.\n\" X \" Hospital, Sisters' Mess,\nX , 10\/3\/17.\nThere is one point I would like to consult you about,\nA very, very dear friend of mine passed over some time\nbetween February 18th and February 24th of this present\nyear. He was my father's great friend, and devoted to\nmy sister Norah and me. After Father died he told me\nhe wished to stand in my father's place, and I always\ncalled him \" Daddy,\" and we were more to each other\nthan many fathers and daughters are. Now I only heard\n\f-540 Miss Raddyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nof his death yesterday, and I do not know the date,\nbut when my father said \" there were two of us that\nstood in the same relation to Daisy but in a slightly\ndifferent way \" tins came into my mind. Also Mr. Wilson\n[pseudonym] had a sitting-room which led into another room,\nand from that to his carpenter's shop and photography\nroom. In the first of these rooms stood a lathe at which he\nfrequently worked, and T would help him at it; also a\nprinting press, which he used a great deal. He wrote\nnearly all day at a table ; and a good deal of the des-\ncription of the house suggested this Second Father's home\nrather than my own father's. Look up his death will\nyou % His name is the Rev. Bertram Wilson, The Pines,\nWickham, Nr. York.\nThus, it appears to us that we have quite an interesting\nlittle problem.\nIt seems that Daisy had two fathers : her real father\nMr. Benson, and her second, or adopted father, the Rev.\nBertram Wilson. On receipt of the extract from the\nsitting of February 21st, 1917, she is, it seems, at once\nstruck by her father's words :\n\" There were, two of us that\nstood in the same relation to Daisy but in a slightly\ndifferent way,\" and she is also struck by the fact that the\nrooms described resemble her Second Father's rooms,\nrather than those of her real father, in wdiose house,\naccording to an answer on one of my question- papers,\nthe sitting-rooms did not communicate. She tells us\nthat this Second Father sat at a table writing nearly all\nday, and that he had a printing-press and also a lathe\nstanding in one of the communicating rooms ; and as,\nin addition to this, she added on one of my qiiestion-\npapers, the fact that this Second Father was a musical\ncomposer, we think that in that fact may perhaps be\nfound the explanation of what Feda calls \" writing in\njerks,\" as the writing of MS. music can fairly be des-\ncribed as jerky, in comparison to ordinary script. This\npoint did not strike Daisy, and we merely put it forward\nas a suggestion. In addition to this, an inspection of\nthe \" Excelsior \" and \" Model \" Hand-Printing Machines\n\flxxvih.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. 541\nhas revealed that Feda's description of the \" machine\nnearly all made of some dark coloured metal, etc.,\" was\nvery near the mark indeed.1\nNow comes the problem. Before the words in answer\nto my question re what relation the communicator is to\nDaisy, Feda describes some rooms communicating, and a\nmachine, as belonging to Mr. Benson ;\nwhich rooms it would\nseem were not his at all, but belonged apparently to his\nold friend, Daisy's Second Father. How does a mistake\nof this kind arise ? There appear to us to be two just\npossible explanations, for either of which, however, it\nwould be necessary to assume the hypothesis of genuine\ncommunication with a discarnate spirit. It is conceivable\nthen that Mr. Benson may have wished to show a man\nother than himself as the occupant of those rooms, but\nhave failed to teU Feda that the mental picture, or what-\never modus operandi he may have been employing, did\nnot apply to him personally. In other words, he may\nhave jumped suddenly from one stibject to another ; a\nfailing often ascribed by Feda to novice communicators.\nAnother explanation might be, that the Second Father\nhimself was somewhere in the offing, crossing the line for\na moment or two, or flinging as it were his own mental\npictures on to the screen, and that Feda thought they\nemanated from Mr. Benson, who lacked the skill to\nclear up the mistake. Such explanations are merely\nhypothetical of course, and do not lead us much further\ntowards solving the riddle.\nThe importance of this mistake, whatever its cause may\nhave been, is, we think, echpsed by the interest attaching\nto Mr. Benson's words \" there were two of us, etc.,\" and\n\" two of us did stand, etc.,\" which we must now analyse.\nAt the time of the sitting we had no idea that Daisy\nhad ever possessed a Second Father, in fact we did not\nknow that such a person as the Rev. Bertram Wilson had\nexisted, much less that he had stood in a paternal relation\n1\n1 have since learned that the Rev. Bertram Wilson's printing press was a\nhand-printing machine of the kind usually used in private houses. It seems\nprobable that it was an \"Excelsior\" or a \"Model,\" as these are the makes\nusually patronised by amateurs.\n\f542 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nto Daisy. We were, therefore, much interested on receipt\nof her letter, the more so as she states therein that she\nhas heard, on March 9th, 1917, namely, not until two weeks\nand two days after the sitting of February 21st, 1917, that\nthis Second Father had died upon some date between\nFebruary 18th and February 24th, 1917 ; and begs me\nto ascertain the exact day. Accordingly I wrote to the\nvicar of Wickham, saying that Mrs. Armstrong was\ndesirous of knowing the date of the Rev. Bertram Wilson's\ndeath. His reply was as follows (the names of course\nare changed)\n:\nExtract from the Rev. R. A. Smith's Letter.\nThe Vicarage, Wickham,\nNr. York, 20\/3\/17.\nDear Madam,\nThe Rev. Bertram Wilson died on February 18^\nat 9.15 p.m. He had been failing for some months and\nlatterly suffered great pain, etc.\nFrom the above extract we see that Daisy's Second\nFather was actually dead at the time of my sitting of\nFebruary 21st, 1917, a fact entirely unknown to Daisy\nat the time of the sitting. She did not know the date\nof his death, even when she heard of his decease two\nweeks and two days later. Now neither Lady Troubridge\nnor I can have known of the Rev. Bertram Wilson's death,\nseeing that we did not know of his existence. Hence it\nappears to us that a considerable significance attaches to\nthe use of the past tense by Mr. Benson, when he speaks\nof this Second Father in the words :\n\" there were two\nof us that stood in the same relation to Daisy, etc.\"'\nAnd later :\n\" two of us did stand, etc.\" Mr. Benson\nmight reasonably be supposed to have met his old friend\non the other side, and to have wished, in answer to my\nquestion, to kill two birds with one stone ; namely, to\nconvey to his daughter Daisy his relationship to her,\nin a manner calculated to do away with the hypothesis of\nmind-reading from the sitter, and at the same time to\n\fixxvui.] Knowledge, of Matters unknown to Sitters. 543\ngive Feda no clue as to his relationship to Daisy ;\nand\nthus forestall any attempt on her part to elaborate state-\nments off her own bat, a temptation to which controls\noccasionally succumb.\nTo Lady Troubridge is due the credit of having grasped\nthe significance of the use of the past tense by Mr.\nBenson. But we were both uncertain as to how far her\ninterpretation was admissible ;\ntherefore, upon the receipt\nof the letter from the vicar of Wickham, I wrote out\na statement giving briefly the incidents that had led up\nto that part of the extract from the sitting of February\n21st, 1917, in which Mr. Benson's significant words occur,\nand sent it with an accompanying letter, and the extract\nitself, to Mrs. Salter, Miss Newton, the Rev. M. A.\nBayfield, Mr. J. G. Piddington, and Mr. J. Arthur Hill,\nand to Mrs. Alice Perrin, the well-known authoress. We\nasked their opinion as to whether, in view of the words\nspoken at the sitting, we must conclude that both men\nwere dead, or one dead and the other alive on February\n21st, 1917. We were naturally very careful to give no\nhint as to what reply would be most acceptable.\nWe thus obtained the opinion of six people, well quali-\nfied, we think, to form unbiassed judgments. The pre-\nponderance of opinion is certainly on the side of Daisy's\nSecond Father having been dead at the time of the sitting.\nMr. J. Arthur Hill inclines strongly to the behef that\nboth the men should have been considered to have been\ndead. He expresses himself as being \" almost certain.\"\nMrs. Alice Perrin has no doubt whatever that the message\nwas meant to convey that Daisy's Second Father was\nalready dead. Mrs. Salter feels rather doubtful, finding\nthe communicator's words ambiguous, she thinks, however,\nthat if the communicator had wished to make it clear\nthat the other man was still alive he should have said\n\" someone now stands in the same relation to Daisy in\nwhich I stood,\" or words to that effect ; and although\nshe feels that the communicator's words really leave the\nquestion open, she thinks that the weight is a little on\nthe side of supposing that the other man was dead. Miss\nNewton considers that the inference to be drawn from\n\f544 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nthe words is that both the real father and the Second\nFather have passed away. Mr. M. A. Bayfield considers\nthat the natural conclusion to be drawn from the words\nis that the Second Father is also dead. Mr. J. G.\nPiddington cannot see how any meaning can be read\ninto the words, other than that the real father and the\nSecond Father both were dead.\nIn view of the opinions above given, it would seem\nthat there is good ground for* supposing that the state-\nment made by Mr. Benson meant something, as he told\nus through Feda was the case.\nThere remained, however, yet one more point to con-\nsider ;\nnamely, whether Daisy was actually in fear of\nher Second Father's imminent death at the date of the\nsitting in question. I wrote to her regarding this, and\nwill quote my questions and her answers just as they\nstand\n.\nQuestion. 1.\nWere you feeling anxious about Mr. Wilson prior to\nFebruary 21st, 1917 ?\nAnswer.\nI had experienced an uneasy feeling that all was not\nwell with him, which was purely a presentiment because\nI had had no news of him for some months, and had\nmyself written for his birthday on February 24th. I\nwas alwaj^s a little anxious, as his health was poor and\nhe was over seventy.\nQuestion 2.\nDid you know he was in ill health prior to February\n21st, 1917 ?\nAnswer.\nYes, his health had been very poor for the past eighteen\nmonths, but not of course bad enough to prevent his\nwriting and getting about a certain amount.\nQuestion 3.\nDid you fear he was in danger of dying prior to Feb-\nruary 21st, 1917 ?\n\flxxviii.] Knowledge of Matters unknown to Sitters. .\">4.i\nAnswer.\nNo, but I knew the nature of his illness (as he had\ntold me privately the Doctor's opinion) ; but from what\nhe said I imagined he might go on living for some years.\nIt appears clear that although Daisy had a presentiment\nchat all was not well, and that although she knew that\nMr. Wilson was not in good health, she was, according\nto her own statement, under the impression that he might\nlive for some years to come ; and that although she Avas\nworried about him at about the time of the sitting in\nquestion, she was not feeling any apprehension regarding\nhis imminent decease. I have questioned Daisy very\nclosely on all matters pertaining to this Second Father\nincident. One point especially appeared to us to require\nfurther confirmation, namely, whether there had ever\nbeen any suggestion of Mr. Wilson being regarded by\nDaisy in the light of a second father during her real\nfather's lifetime. Had this been the case, there would\nhave been far less importance attaching to the use of\nthe past tense by the communicator as being indicative\nof the fact that Mr. Wilson was already dead on February\n21st, 1917. In her letter dated March 10, 1917 (see\nabove, p. 539), Daisy states that Mr. Wilson told her that\nhe wished to stand in her father's place after her father\ndied, but she did not definitely state that this suggestion\nhad never been broached during her real father's lifetime,\nand, although improbable, it seemed just possible that\nMr. Wilson might have assumed the role of second father,\nwhile the real father lived. This it appears was not the\ncase, and Daisy has most kindly signed a statement\nregarding this and other points.\nI may say that Lady Troubridge had never any doubt\nthat Mr. Benson's words must be taken as meaning that\nhis old friend was dead at the date of the sitting. She\nargued in this way :\n\" Supposing a man's first wife to\nbe communicating with his second wife during a sitting,\nand the first wife when asked to define her relationship\nto the husband replied \" there were two of us that stood\nin the same relation to Tom,\" and again \" two of us\n\f546 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\ndid stand in the same relation to Tom,\"' the sitter, being\nthe second wife, might reasonably reply :\n\" that is in-\ncorrect, because I did not stand in that relationship to\nTom at the same time as you did, but I do stand in\nit now that you have ceased to do so.\" And this I\nthink is quite logical.\nIt may be added that both Mr. Benson's daughters\nwere much struck by the phrase: \"Do you follow me?\"\nThis phrase, they tell us, was frequently used by Mr.\nBenson during his lifetime, just as were the words :\n\" Do\nyou understand 1\n\" which occurred earlier in the sitting.\nWith this incident of Daisy's Second Father we end\nthis paper. At a later sitting, referred to in Mrs. Arm-\nstrong's statement, namely, on February 28th, 1917, Daisy\nArmstrong's husband purported to communicate. This\ncommunicator gave some good proofs of identity, and from\nhim also we obtained facts which were entirely unknown\nto us at the date of the sitting. They were, however,\nowing perhaps to the fact of the purporting communi-\ncator being one of many young officers killed in the war,\nnot so striking as those purporting to come from Daisy's\nfather, Mr. Benson.\n\fLXXVIII.] Appendix A. 547\nAPPENDIX A.\nIt has seemed advisable to us to obtain in writing from\nthe two medical men whom we consulted, a confirmation\nof their verbal statement made to us regarding the affec-\ntion of A. V. B.'s eye, which, in their opinion, was a\npremonitory symptom of her stroke. Lady Troubridge\ntherefore wrote to these two gentlemen, and a copy of\nthe relevant portion of their letters in reply appears below.\nThe first extract is from the letter of one of the medical\nmen who actually attended A. V. B. from the onset of\nher last illness. The second extract is from the letter\nof a medical man who did not attend A. V. B., but who\nknew her personally, and in addition to this, whose\npractice has been of a nature to give him exceptionally\nextensive experience in cases of apoplectic seizure.\nExtract from Dr. 's Letter.\nGeorge Hotel, ,\nSussex, June 26th, 1918.\nDear [Lady] Troubridge,\nMany thanks for your letter. I remember quite\nwell all you mentioned with regard to Mrs. .\nCerebral haemorrhages are often preceded by a rupture\nof a delicate vein or artery in the eye, causing the exact\nsymptom of impaired vision you quote. 1\nThere can be\nno doubt whatever that the condition was a part of the\nwhole ending, practically the first evidence of it, though\nit may occur without the subsequent cerebral haemorrhage\ncoming on at the time.\n1 The symptom quoted was that described by A. V. B. in her diary\nfor 1916, in which she described her visual affection as being like\n\" floating chenille worms \" in front of her left eye.\n2 M\n\f548 Miss Radclyjfe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nExtract from Dr. 's letter.\nSt. John's Wood, N.W.,\nJuly 2nd, 1918.\nMy dear Una,\nPlease excuse the delay in answering your letter,\nbut I was away in the country for the week end. Now\nin reference to Mrs. B , I can assure you that our\nmutual friend can let her mind rest quite tranquil. The\nattack that Mrs. B had, there is no doubt had been\ncoming on for some time, and the black streaks which\nyou very well describe as like chenille worms often are\nseen by the person when a clot has been forming on the\nbrain.\nOne lady I attended at , called me in one day on\naccount of having, as she described it, floating string\nbefore her eyes ;\nwell, ten days after, although seeming\nwell at the time, she had a stroke from which she never\nrecovered.\nI had also another case which I well remember, a woman\nabout fifty sent for me, and said \" I am sorry to trouble\nyou to come and see me, for I am sure you will laugh\nwhen I tell you what I am suffering from . . .\n(some irrelevant symptoms omitted), and what is strange\nis I see things floating before my eyes and I want to\ncatch them with my hands.\" I simply said they were\nnothing, although I had my doubts. Well, three days\nafter, she had a seizure, she lived for about three months.\n\fLXXVIII.] Appendix B. 549\nAPPENDIX B.\nSince the above was written on the \" Billy \" episode it\nhas become necessary to add yet a few more words, for\nA. V. B. through Feda has, we think, rounded up the\nepisode in question by clearly indicating that \" Billy\n\"\nwas indeed a wire-haired terrier.\nFirst of all it is necessary to remember that although\nduring the sittings of Dec. 6th, 1916, and Dec. 13th, 1916,\nthe description given apparently stamped the dog as\nbeing \" Billy,\" Lady Troubridge's wire-haired terrier, there\nwas very little reference made to \" Billy's \" personal\nappearance. But, on Oct. 17th, 1917, during a Leonard\nsitting, taken and recorded by me at Datchet, words were\nspoken by Feda which we think it is admissible to\nassume defined the dog \" Billy \" as being a wire-haired\nterrier. Because, although \" Billy \" is not mentioned by\nname in the present sitting, and is only referred to as a\ndog in what Feda calls the \"spirit world\" of whom\nA. V. B. sees a good deal, we have been clearly told on\nDec. 6th, 1916, and Dec. 13th, 1916, that A. V. B. sees\na lot of \" Billy \" and on no occasion has any other dog\nbeen mentioned in conjunction with her life in her present\nstate.\nIt happens that Lady Troubridge had accompanied me\nto Datchet, together with a wire-haired terrier at present\nin her possession. She had not, however, attended the\nsitting. But prior to the sitting Mrs. Leonard had seen\nand petted the terrier in question. This was the first\ntime that Mrs. Leonard had spoken to the dog, though\nshe had seen him casually once after a sitting.\nDuring the sitting of October 17th, 1917, just as Feda\nwas about to leave her medium, I obtained the following\nwords :\nF. She says give her love to Mrs. Una. Ladye says\n\f550 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge. [part\nthere is a dog like that, she often sees in the\nSpirit World.\nM. R. H. Like what ?\nF. Like the dog that Mrs. Una's got with her to-day,\na white dog, with dirty marks on it.\nHere we have apparently A. V. B. or Feda recognising\na similarity which most certainly does exist between Lady\nTroubridge's present wire-haired terrier and the \" Billy\n\"\nof former days. When Feda says, \" a white dog with\ndirty marks on it \" the description is correct for both\nthe terriers, but especially so for \" Billy \" who was more\nheavily marked and had much more black about him\nthan the present dog.\nOne may ask, how comes it that Feda or A. V. B.\nsaw the present dog, on October 17th, 1917, as he was\nnot in the room when the medium was in trance, and the\nfact that the medium had spoken to the dog just prior\nto the sitting might suggest that a picture of him had\nbeen found photographed on her mind and had been\nutilised by the trance-personality or the purporting com-\nmunicator. This does not explain, however, the fact of\nthe comparison being made between the living dog and\na dog often seen by A. V. B. in the \" spirit world.\"\nFeda and A. V. B. both claim to be on the spot, as it\nwere, before sittings begin, they both claim to overhear\nconversations that occur, and to observe actions and\nobjects prior to sittings.\nInterest is added to this little rounding up of the\n\" Billy \" incident by the fact that about two months\nprior to this sitting of October 17th, 1917, Lady Trou-\nbridge and myself, although still anonymous, had spent\na couple of nights with Mrs. Leonard in Devonshire for\nthe purpose of holding sittings during Mrs. Leonard's\nvacation. During that visit we had with us a black and\ntan Pekinese, with whom Mrs. Leonard made tremendous\nfriends. During that visit also my collie-dog was mentioned\nonce in Mrs. Leonard's hearing, although no description\nof him was given, and his name was not mentioned.\nOne would think that had any dog been very much\n\fLXXVIII.] Appendix B. 551\nassociated with us in Mrs. Leonard's mind it should have\nbeen the Pekinese, yet, although we had four sittings\nduring our stay with Mrs. Leonard in Devonshire, no\nmention was made of \"Billy,\" and no comparison was\ndrawn between the Pekinese with whom Mrs. Leonard\nwas hving in close contact and any dog in the \" spirit\nworld.\" She was. in fact, seeing the Pekinese almost every\nmoment of the day. It was not until the present wire-\nhaired terrier was brought upon the scene that what we\nthink may reasonably be taken as being another allusion\nto \" Billy \" occurred, the memory of him having been\nrevived apparently by the proximity of a dog of his own\nparticular breed.\n\f552 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge.\nAPPENDIX C.\n[part\nW\nX\npq\nO\n\fLXXVIII.] Appendix D. 553\nAPPENDIX D.\nMrs. Armstrong's Statement.\nRegarding the sittings of February 14th, February 21st,\nand February 28th, 1917, which were held with Mrs.\nLeonard by M. Radclyffe-Hall at my request, I being\nin X at the time : \u2014I wish to state that I had not\nthe slightest idea that the sittings were taking place upon\nthe above-mentioned dates. I had written to M. Radclyffe\nHall requesting her to endeavour to get into touch with\nmy late husband, but I did not of course know when she\nproposed making the effort. The first intimation I had\nfrom M. Radclyffe-Hall that the sittings of the 14th and\n21st had occurred was when, some weeks later, I received\nextracts from the sittings sent to me by her ; and the\nsame applies to the sitting of February 28th. With\nthese three extracts M. Radclyffe-Hall sent me question\npapers dealing with points in the sittings, which question\npapers I answered to the best of my ability at the time,\nreturning them to her. On my return to England I\nmade further inquiries re certain details at the suggestion\nof M. Radclyffe-Hall ; and through the assistance of my\nmother and sister was able to completely verify one or\ntwo little points. On May 10th, 1917, I went to M.\nRadclyffe-Hall's flat, and during the afternoon and evening\nwas able to communicate to her the further pieces of\ninformation which I had obtained. M. Radclyffe-Hall\nmade careful notes while I did so. She was very parti-\ncular about one point, namely, whether my Father's\nfriend, the Rev. Bertram Wilson, had stood in the relation\nof a \" Second Father \" to me during my own Father's\nlifetime. I assured M. Radclyffe-Hall that there had\nnever been the slightest intimation given during my\nFather's lifetime that Mr. Wilson wished to stand in a\npaternal relationship to me ; it was only after my Father's\n\f554 Miss Radclyffe-Hall and Lady Troubridge.\ndeath that this gentleman asked me to look upon him as\na Father, and insisted that I should call him \" Daddy.\"\nMr. Wilson wished me to go and live with him and fill\na daughter's place in his life. I did not go and five\nwith him, although after my Father's death he became\nto all intents and purposes my Father. As may be seen\nby my letter, written from \" X \" Hospital, X ,\n10.3.17,\nI did not know of my \"Second Father's\" death until\nsome sixteen days after M. Radclyffe-Hall's sitting of\nFebruary 21st, and even then I did not know the date\nof his death, having only heard that he had died\nsome time between February 18th and 24th of this\npresent year. During my visit to M. Radclyffe-Hall's\nflat on May 10th, 1917, I told her that I had turned\nup the letter written to me by my late husband from\nMalta, and posted after he left that place. Having the\nletter with me, I requested M. Radclyffe-Hall to read for\nherself that portion of the letter which pertained to my\nhusband's kit, etc., and which appeared to have a direct\nbearing upon some words given through Feda during the\nLeonard sitting of February 28th, 1917. M. Radclyffe-\nHall read that portion of the letter, and requested me to\nmake a copy of same, which I did. I saw the letter\nwritten by M. Radclyffe-Hall to Mrs. Leonard asking for\nan appointment for me. In it she gave no clue as to\nmy having returned from abroad\u2014on the contrary, she\nsaid that I was a friend of hers who was about to leave\nEngland. I do not consider that her letter gave the\nslightest clue to my identity.\n(Signed) Daisy Armstrong.\nMay Uth, 1917.\n\fFORMER PRESIDENTS OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nProfessor Henry Sidgwiok, - 1882-84.\nProfessor Balfour Stewart,\nF.R.S., 1885-87.\nProfessor Henry Sidgwiok, - 1888-92.\nThe Right Hon. a.
