But, if what h\nas already\nbeen prem\nifed be attentively confidered, this fuppofition will im\nm\nedi*\nately vanifh; for God, who ordain\ned the courfe of n\nature, certainly\nforefaw the m\ninuteft turn of every m\nan\u2019s will, an\nd eventually contrived\nhis fate to correfpondtherew\nith, foa\ns to adm\nit its freean\nd uncontrouled\nchoice.

Yet neverthelefs, fuch is the infinite prefcience\nand providence of God, that forefeeing the defires and deferts of all wife\nand holy men, in their different ages and times, he alfo laid their fates\nfoiling to their aftions. He forcfaw Jofeph\u2019s prayers and tears in his\ncaptivity, and accordingly provided his advance in nature to correfpond\ntherewith*.

H\nence it is evident that thefe lum\ninaries w\nere\nnot only placed in theh\neavens to give light upon the earth, to govern\nthe feafon\ns, an\nd to fet bounds to time; but alfo to com\nm\nunicatefigns\nan\ndtokens tom\nankind, of things to com\ne.

The fun is the fountainof heat, an\nd that heat is the nurfe of\nlife; an\nd the m\noon is the fountain of m\noifture, which tem\npers the vio\u00ad\nlent heat of the fun, and m\nodifies all his operations. But the fun and\nm\noon, an\nd all the planets, have each of them aparticular fpecific pro\u00ad\nperty, accordingto their ow\nn innate quality, an\nd according to the nature\nof that fign or band of ftars, under which they happen to be pofited.\nThis is a fa\u00a3\nt eftablifhed by repeated obfervation an\nd experience>for\nw\nhen the fun en\nters theequinodtial fign Aries, the fpring begins toihew\nherfelf, an\ndall vegetative nature, by the m\noon\u2019s hum\nidity, an\nd the fun\u2019s\ntem\nperate heat, feem\ns to revive an\nd flourifh, and, a\ns it w\nere, to rife from\nthe dead; whitherthecold blafts of thehycm\nnal air, had beforeconfigned\nit. So w\nhen his radian\nt beam\ns enter the fign Taurus, they ftir upthe\nbenignInfluences of the Pleiades an\nd H\nyades>Hoedi being then to the\nnorth, an\nd Orion to thefouth, an\nd Arfturus finking belowthehorizon ;\nan\nd their cold an\nd tem\npeftuous effed\nts begin to ceafe, a\ns they are fuc-\nceeded by thefe benevolent conftellations, whichproduce w\narmibuthern\nwinds, an\ndgentleihowers, repleniihing theearth, an\ndcaufingvegetation.\nAgain, w\nhen the fun rifes with the Dog-ftar, w\ne fin\nd aninfluence which\ncaufes vehem\ncncy of heat, contagion, an\nd infirm\nity. M\nedicam\nents ad-\nm\niniitered under this conftellation, prove hardan\nd obnoxious; and we\nfinddogs at this tim\ne a\nre apt to ru\nn m\nad; the feais troubledwithoutany\napparent caufe, and all n\nature feem\ns m\nore or lefs opprefled by it; an\nd\nyet thefe effeds a\nre never found tobeequally violent inanytwofum\nm\ners,\nwhich clearly proves an influence inthe ftars, a\ns well a\ns in the fun. And\nagain, though the fun keeps the fam\ne conftant an\nd invariable courfe\nthrough the twelve figns of the Zodiack, for a\nninfinity of annual revo\u00ad\nlutions, yet w\ne never find the feafon\ns an\nd w\neather exaftly correfpond,\nwhich they doubtlefs would do, w\nas it not that cold an\ndh\near,, an\ndwind\nand rain, aregoverned by the configurations the fun has with the planets\nand fixed ftars; andthis alfo evidentlyproves the force of their influence.\nIt is likewife m\nanifeft^that w\nhenever the planet Saturn is palling out of\none fign intoanother, the W\neath\ner is m\noreor lefs turbulentandunfettled*-\nBut it is not the w\neather only, nor the inanim\nate part of thecreation\n*\nalone, that is affeded by the influences of the fun, m\noon, an\nd planets;\nfor we find they operate upon the hum\nan fpecies, an\nd upon all anim\nate\nnature, in every part of the world. The fun, an\nd the quality of the\nheavens about the torrid zone, naturally occafion thofe m\nen who a\nreb\norn\n-\nan\nd live under it,' to be quite black, with ihort crifped hair, of am\nean\nliature, and hot conftitution, im\nbibing a fierce an\ndfavage ipirity and\nthis\n\f24 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthis by reafo\nn of the fun\u2019scontinual H\nayan\nd pow\ner inthat fiery region.\nIt is obfervable, that the inhabitants of the fouth, a\nre of abetter and\nquicker wit, an\nd m\nuch m\nore ingenious an\nd tradtable; an\nd this is ac\u00ad\ncounted for by their vertical point being fituated n\nearer the zodiac, in\nwhich theplanets m\nove. So likewife the inhabitants of the north a\nreof\na llrong body, but of ru\nde m\nan\nn\ners an\nd condition, becaufe their vertical\npoint isplaced atagreat diftance fromthefun\u2019scourfe; an\ndthereforethey\nabound with cold an\nd m\noifture, an\nd a\nre of aphlegm\natic conftitution, of\na fair com\nplexion, tall, courageous, an\nd ingenuous. Europe being\nfituated in the north-weft part of the earth, is under M\nars in Aries, andi\nby reafo\nn of this planet ruling in that triplicity, its inhabitantsa\nre na- \u25a0>\nturally of anoble an\nd m\nagnanim\nous fpirit, given to m\nartial exploits, an\nd\nfeats of war; of agenerous m\nind, an\ndcourteous m\nanners. And thus the\nfun, mo d i f i e d f i ^ g n s an\nd conftellations through which he\npafies, regulates the clim\nates, an\nd fheds hisinfluenceupon all m\nankind,\nleaving behind himevident m\narks \u00a9\nf his governm\nent an\nd fw\nay. Som\ne,\nindeed, have attem\npted to account for the iwarthy an\nd black com\nplexion\nof the favage race, by avariety of other plaufible conjedtures; but n\non\ne\narc to be relied on, that do not attribute its caufe to the intenfe heat an\nd\npow\ner of the fun in thofe clim\nates; than which nothing can be m\nore\nconfonant to reafon\n, fincew\ne find, even in this country, that if w\ne rem\nain\nlong together inthe fun, intheheat of fum\nm\ner, ourcom\nplexions change,\nandw\ne becom\ne inadegree tannedan\ndfw\narthy.\nConfpicuous a\ns a\nre the influences of the fun, thofe of the m\noon are n\no\nlefs fo\n. This is evincedby a confiderationof that w\nonderful an\nd never-\nceafingoperation of the m\noon upon the ocean, fo a\ns to occafion that per\u00ad\npetual flux an\nd reflux of thefea, whichw\ne call tides. H\nerew\nefee the\nw\natersof thevaft ocean, forgetful, a\ns it w\nere, of their n\natural reft, m\nove\nan\nd roll in tides obfequious to the ftrong attradtive pow\ner of the m\noon,\nan\nd with anincreafe ordim\ninution of force, in proportion a\nsihe app\nears\nin ftrength, or w\nant of afp\ned\nt. This is a\nninfluence fo univerfally ad\u00ad\nm\nitted, an\nd fo peculiar to that lum\ninary, that it cftablifhes at once the\ndodtrin\ne we contend for. But there a\nre num\nerous other inftances of\ntheeffed\nts of the m\noon, n\nolefscom\nm\non than extraordinary, an\nd perfedtly\nwell known. Thofe unhappy perfons who labour under adeprivationof\nfenfe, a\nn\nd a\nre afflid\nted with lunacy, have their fits m\nore violent an\nd ter\u00ad\nrible, in proportion a\ns them\noon increafes ordim\niniihes in light an\ndm\no\u00ad\ntion; an\nd in all chronic an\ndacute difeafes, her pow\ner an\nd influence a\nre\nvifibly an\nd forcibly felt.

The gardener alfobrings u\ns abundant teftim\nonies of\nthe influence of the m\noon upon the vegetable w\norld.

Thefe\neffeitsan\ndinfluencesof them\noon, a\nre focom\nm\non;an\ndfogenerallyknown,\nthat it w\nere alm\noft ncedlefs to repeat themhere, but for the purpofe of\ndraw\ning this conclufion, that a\ns on\ne planet h\nas aknow\nn an\ndforcible ac\u00ad\ntion upon fublunary things, it is n\natural to believe that all the others\na\nreendued, in fom\ne degree, with afim\nilar force an\nd virtue. In\ndeed m\noil\nphyficians knowthat theplanet Satu\nrn ru\nles all clim\nadterical years, a\ns the\nfun doth critical days, an\ndthe m\noon thecrifis of all acutedifeafes; and\nthat every feventh year Saturn com\nes to the fquare or oppofition of his\nplace in the radix of every m\nan\u2019snativity; an\ndthat after therevolution\nof the fun, he becom\nes the chief ruler of critical days; an\nd is often\nobferved, by his configurations with them\noon, to fet afid\ne thefatal crifis\nof thofe defperate disord\ners, over which the patient w\nas not expefted to\nlive. From thefe phyfical reafon\ns, w\ne m\nay fafely conclude that Saturn\nis by n\nature cold and m\nelancholy, a\ns the fun is hot an\ndchearful; an\nd\nbeing thus oppolite to the funjn quality ande\nflfe\nd\nl, fo is heinrelation to\nthe figns and m\nanfions of the h\neavensw\nhere he b\nears rule, an\nd therefore\ninclines alw\nays to cold, a\ns thefun d\noes to heat. H\nence it follows, that\nw\nhenthe fun is inAquaries, which is the properfign of Saturn, an\nd op-^\npolitetohis ow\nnfignLeo, the w\neatherinclines m\nore to coldthan to heat; *\nand at every conjunilion, fquare, oroppofition of Saturn with the two 1\ngreat lum\ninaries, we alw\nays findthe w\neather cold, m\noill, an\nd lowering, 1\neven in the m\nidft of fum\nm\ner, unlefs the rays of Jupiter or M\nars inter- *\npofe, iu which cafe thefe effeits are fotnew\nhat lefs vifiblc. Thus, w\ne\n\u00a3 m\nay\n\f* 6 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nm\nay prefum\ne to affirm\n, that the influencesof the fun, m\noon, an\ndplanets,\na\nreeftablifhed beyondcontradiction.\nBut befidcs thefe ligniorities of the fun, m\noon, an\nd planets, thefixed\nj!tirs have alio theirprincipalities in the heavens. The Lord, w\nho give\nthe fu\nn fora light by day, gave the ordinances of the m\noon an\nd ltars alio,\nfor a light by night; an\nd to thefeilars hath he com\nm\nitted acertainrule\nor dominion* over the day an\nd night, an\nd that prom\nifeuoufly. Now the\nliars have n\no vifible operationupon us, befidcs tiiut little light they ad\u00ad\nmin\niiter to our eyes in adark an\nd clear night; an\nd that islbvery fin\nal1,\nthat a\nHthe ftars in heaven, befid\nes thefun an\nd m\noon, a\nre n\no\nr to b\necom\n\u00ad\np\nared\n, in this refpeft, with the fm\nallcfl wax-light; an\nd this little light\nro\no is only to h\ne h\nad w\nhen the nights a\nre feren\ne an\ndunclouded. Can it\nthen be luppoled that God m\nade thefe glorious bodies, m\nany of which\na\nrebigger th\nan the w\nhole earth, an\nd m\nove in their orbs a\ns lo m\nany other\nw\norlds in the heavens, m\nerely for atwinkle inthe night, a\nn\nd that only\nw\nhen thew\neather perm\nits ? lo! every little duify that grow\ns u\npon thecold\nground, h\nas a fecret an\nd infenfiblevirtue w\nrapt in itsleaves an\ndflow\ners ;\nan\nd have thefe celeftial bodies n\noinfiuencesbut w\nhat w\ne now an\nd then\ncatch w\nith our eyes, a\ns they occafionally fparkle their dim glances u\npon\nu\ns >Yes, theyhave each of them a feciet pow\ner an\nd virtue, w\nherew\nith\nthey aft uponallearthly things, a\nswell by daya\nsby night, a\nn\nd in cloudy\na\ns well a\ns in clearw\neather. Buta\ns their operations a\nre not perform\ned by\nfeniible an\nd palpable m\neans, it follows that they haveafecret an\nd hidden\nway of rule, w\nherebytheir influencesa\nreim\nperceptibly infufedinto every\nconcern of this life. And a\ns have the ftars, fo alfo have the fun an\nd\nm\noon, afecret an\nd im\nperceptible aftion, peculiar to them\nfelves; for it is\nnot the m\nere heat that gives life, n\nor the m\nere m\noifture that fuftains it;\nfor if that w\nerethecafe, thenm\nightm\nanm\nakelivingcreaturesartificially.\nIt is true that heat m\nay hatch theeggs, butall theingenuityof m\nancan\u00ad\nnot m\nake a\nnegg that can behatched; for there is a fecret operationof\nthefun an\nd m\noon, independent of heat an\ndm\noifture, neceflary tothe pro\u00ad\nduction of life, both in vegetive an\nd fenfitive anim\nals. And in thefe\nfecret an\nd infenfible operations, befidcs the light that they give, confifts\nthat rule which the iun, m\noon, and ftars w\nere ordain\ned to exercife over\nall the fon\ns of day andnight; an\ndherein a\nre w\nrittenall thofe ordinances\nof the m\noon and ftars, which a\nre to be a law unto m\nankind, an\nd to the\nw\nhole body of nature, fo long a\ns the w\norld*f* endures.

But by an earthly\nmeans alone, it is evident, they cannot come to pafs; for we know ex\u00ad\nperimentally, that neither fire,, earth,, air,, or water, can of themfelves in\u00ad\nfufe into the rofe its grateful and fragrant fmell j it mult therefore pro\u00ad\nceed from the agency of fome fp iritu a l or material fubftance, far faperior\nin efficacy and virtue to any earthly element. If it proceeds from a fpi-\nritual fubftance, it is effedied either by the angels, or by the fo u l o f the\nworld. But by the angels we know it cannot be, for they have their pe\u00ad\nculiar offices allotted them in another w ay; and though they are fubjedts\nof the world, yet are they no part of the great frame of nature, from\nwhence all things in their order are formed. And if it be effected by the\nJ iu l o f the world, then certainly muft there be l'uch a foul fomewhere ex-\nifting, which atprefent, is a matter in difpute among the learned j and this\nfoulmuft have a fpccial feat in the world, worthy of itfelf, from whence it\nmay inform and adluate every minute particle of the creation.. If this be\nadmitted, then it undoubtedly dwells among the celeftial matter, and from\nthence fupplies the earth, through the medium o f the heavenly bodies,\nwith all that power and virtue, which brings to pafs that variety of ihape,\ncolour, fmell, life, and increafe, which we daily fee come to pafs. But\nif this hypothefis be denied,, and it is infilled that the earth is fup-\nplied with all her fecret virtues by fome fupernatural material fubftance;\nthen name any one thing befides the heavenly matter, and the ftars o f\nheaven, that can be fuppofed to form that fubftance, and the argument\nceafes j for either way it proves an influence and afrology in the heavens,\nbeyond contradiction,, and there w ill remain only one queftion to be de\u00ad\ncided, which is, Whether thefe celeftial influences create the fucceffion o f\nearthly things, by an immediate power from God, or whether there exifts\nF a\n\f40 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\na general foul in the world, through the means of which they come to\npais in a due order and courfe of nature? Utrum horum mavis accipc; I\ncontend for no more. \u201c In the beginning God created the heaven and\nthe earth \u2022, and the earth was without form, and void, and darknefs was\nupon the face of the deep, and the fpirit of God moved upon the face o f\nthe waters\/' Here, when there was nothing but earth and water, and\ndarknefs overfpread all, the fp ir it o f God maintained that chaotic mafs,\nand managed the earth by the water, and the water and darknefs by\nhimfclf. But now both the earth and water are under thefa ce o f heaven,\nand the light is upon this heaven, and the fpirit of God moveth upon the\nface of the heavens in that lig h t; and as he actuates the earth and the\nwaters by the heavens, fo doth he actuate the heavens by him felf And\nagreeably to this idea fpeaks the prophet Hofea, when he fays, God w ill\nhear the heavens, and they Jhall hear the earth, and the earth the corn and\nwine and oil, and they * Jezreel wherein he ihews us, that as man lives\nby coin and wine, fo they by the earth, and the earth by the heavens; and\nif fo, then by the heavens is it that the earth receives all its efficacy and\nvirtue, whereby it brings forth fmell, colour, tafte, and life. Mofes\nalfo tells us, that God Jhall open his good treeJure the heavens, to give rain\nunto the land, arid to blefs all the -f* works o f our hands; whence it is evi\u00ad\ndent that there lodges in the celeitial influences, a faculty of fortunating\ncivil affairs, as well as of managing natural things ; and that the root of\nall earthly bleffings is from heaven. Mofes fays again, that the fu n , moon,\nand flars, God hath dijlributed unto a ll nations under heaven; and the\nPfalmift fpeaking of the fun and heavenly bodies, fays, they declare the\nglory o f God, and Jleewfo r th his handy-work ; day and night do continually\ntell o f them, and their voice is heard in all languages, and their words are\ngone into the ends o f the \u00a7 world-, by which we learn that the heavens,\nand all the liars therein, are full of fuch virtues as the whole world hath\nneed of; and that thefe virtues God hath lodged in the heavens, to be\ndealt out for the comfort and happinefs of his creatures upon earth. H is\nJP in t (faith Job) hath garnijl^ed the \\ heavens-, and by the fp ir it o f bis\nmouth was the whole army o f heaven made.\nThe notion, or idea, that there is one general foul aduating the whole\nworld, as there is one foul informing every man\u2019s body, was not only the\nopinion of the Platonifts and ancient philofophers, but alfo of many\nlearned men in later ages ; and I muff confefs, it appears very reafonable to\nbelieve, that the world has fuch a foul. For were there not one and the\nlame general living virtue, comprehending the whole fyftem of nature,\nt\n* Hofea \u00ab. at, 22. f Deut. xxviii. 12, \u00a7 Deut. \u00a1v. 19.

Pfal. xXKiu. 16.\nfrom\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y , 41\nfrom the exterior circumference o f the heavens to the inmoil center of the\nearth, how could the lympathies and antipathies of nature pofubly work\ninch compliances and differences as we know they do, at the amazing\ndiitances we fee them, and without any vifible or imaginable contact;\nunlefs fome faculty exifts in the world, that is capable of fuftaining this\ninvifible correfpondency between one creature and another ? Where life\nis, thefe things are eafily effedted; as the child in the womb is nouriihed\nby the food the mother eats; but in the inanimate part of the creation,\nwe are at a lofs which way to account for it. Now admitting that there\nreally is fuch an univerfal foul exiiting, yet is it queftionable whether\nthis foul be inteHeftual, or merely vegetive. That there is an intelledtual\npower informing the whole world, as the foul does the body, is not to be\ndoubted; for otherwife the whole frame of nature would be inert and\nmotionleis; but then, if we admit the foul of the world to carry this in\u00ad\ntellect in its own brain, it w ill follow, that this foul is a G od; lor an\nintdledtual being, filling heaven and earth with its prefence, is an attri\u00ad\nbute o f* Gods. Hence I conclude there is an univerfal foul in the.\nworld, but that it is only vegetive, and not intellectual; and that in this\nfoul dwells the fpirit of Almighty God, who fillcth the heavens and the\nearth with his prefence, and from hence garniiheth the heavens, and\ncaufeth the precious influences of the fun, moon, and itars, to be diftri-\nbuted into all parts of the \u00a7 world. And thus God rules immediately in\nthe heavens, but rules the world mediately by the heavens. It is true,\nindeed, that God is equally well able to govern and maintain the world\nwithout means, as he was at firil to conftitute and create the frame of na\u00ad\nture ; but fuch is His divine w ill and pleafure, that he has thought fit to\nbring all things to pafs by virtue of means, as ordained from the beginning\no f the world. It is a common and true maxim, that God and nature\nhave made nothing in vain; and yet it is as true, that grafs and herbs\ngrow where no creatures live to eat -f*them. Now were the world go\u00ad\nverned by God\u2019s immediate prefence only, then would the produ&ion of\nthis grafs and herb be a work in vain; becaufe God\u2019s word brings\nforth all things at pleafure\u00ab,; and having a power of increafing or dimi-\nniihing its operation in a moment, would certainly not have brought forth\nthis fertility in an uninhabited and defolate country. But nature running\nher courfe by a conftant and unchangeable decree, has no power to ceal'e\nher work without a miracle, and therefore though the grals may grow in\nvain, yet nature\u2019s operations are not in vain, fince by one and the fame\ncaufe, it produces vegetation in all parts of the world.\n# See Jer. xxiii, 23, 24, 25, \u00a7 A&S xvii. \u00ab8, Job XXvi. 13. Dcut. ivr. 19*\nt Job xxxviii. 26. '\nKnown\n\f42 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nKnown unto God are a ll his works\u00a1from the beginning o f th e* w orld; and\ntherefore it would be derogatory to the attributes of the Deity, not to be\u00ad\nlieve that the minuted: events of this world, were forefeen and provided\nfor in that moil perfect frame or model of nature, which as we have al\u00ad\nready feen, may be compared to the conftruttion of a watch, confiiling of\nmany fmall wheels, regulated by one mailer-wheel, or firil mover, which\nbeing wound up at the creation, with the line of time, of a feemingly\ninfinite length, has ever fince been winding off, unto the prefent hour;\nand yet is there ilill more line upon the w heel; but how much remains,\nis only in the breail of the Almighty. And when this line ihall be en^\ntirely wound off, then w ill the frame of nature find its -f*period, and all\nfubordinate wheels will ceafe their motion. But until that time, there\nis allotted in this frame of nature, unto every one that comes into the\nworld, a certain order or courfe of life, by which he runs through fick-\nnefs and health, honour and diihonour, and all the occurrences of life,\nfrom his cradle to the grave. For man is, as it were, a little world within\nhim felf; and though he itand but as one wheel in the frame of the great\nworld, yet within this one there feems many thoufands of wheels, efpe-\ncially in enterpriiing people, which appear to move one within another\nalmoit ad infinitum, till the thread turned on the outer wheel break, or\nelfe be wound oft, and there they make a flop, and die. All thefe things\nGod, who made man at the firil, perfedtly knows, and foreknew, from\nthe beginning of the world; and by this order of man\u2019s life, he perfedlly-\nknows all the paflages of our lives, and even the moil fecret thoughts of\nour hearts, both fleeping and J waking; and how one thought drives off,\nand brings on another, and continues fo doing till the lafl moment of our\nlife, when our breath fails. Now every man being, as it were, a wheel,\nof the great world, it will follow that all men move in a certain frame or\nwheel above themfelves, by virtue of which the mailer-wheel of every\nman\u2019s life is put in motion; and this wheel is fubordinate unto others,\nand thefe alfo unto the mailer-wheel of the whole world, which is the\nhigh and mighty wheel of heaven, wherein the fun, moon, and flars are*\nfet, to carry on the great works of nature, unto the end of time. And\nhence comes the original of every man\u2019s nativity, and of all natural qua\u00ad\nlities, paflions, and incidents of our lives, except the motions of our free\u00ad\nwill and reafon, which may be allured and inclined by the works of na\u00ad\nture, but cannot beforced by them. Now above and beyond this great\nwheel of nature, there is yet another \u00a7 wheel, within which the heavens\nthemfelves are turned; and herein is that great and hidden line of time,\nwhereby the whole world, with all its dependencies, is made to hold on\nand continue its motion, unto the final end of all things; and this ilu~\n* Ads xv, iS. | i Peter iii.

Such was the cafe when the Almighty made the\nfun and moon ftand Hill j and when, at the prayer of Ifaiah, he reverfed\nits courfe, and made itretrograde. Such alfo were the works of our Savi\u00ad\nour, when he raifed the dead, and gave light to men born blind. And fuch\nwas the work of God, when the fea made a lane for men to pafs through\non dry ground; and when the fire had no power to fcorch, nor to burn\nthofe who walked in the midit of 'f it. Thefe miracles, it is true, had\nno immediate dependence upon the works of nature; and yet, as God\nfrom the beginning faw the neceflity of them, and the occafion upon\nwhich they would be required, it is reafonable to fuppofe he fet down in\nhis eternal mind the contrivance of thefe miracles, and fo ordained them\nto keep pace with the works of nature, and to come to pafs at their ap\u00ad\npointed leafons, without difturbing or deranging that univerfal frame of\nthe world, out of which all natural things proceed, and from whence all\nthe hoft 6f heaven derive their faculty of influencing earthly fubftances.\nAnd that the heavenly bodies poflefs thefe influences, in an infinitely\npowerful degree, I believe will not be denied, iince both feripture and\nreafon, as we have now feen, fubftantially prove them. The ancient\nphilofophers were unanimous in fubferibing to this opinion, even with\u00ad\nout the teftimony of the facred writings; and many very learned authors,\nin later ages, have fupported the fame do&rine. Milton gives us a very\nftriking proof of his belief of the ftarry influence, in the following p a t\nfage of his Paradife Loft:*\nTo the blank moon\nHer office they preferib\u2019d ; to th* other five,\nTheir planetary motions and afpefts,\nIn fextile, fquare, and trine, and oppofite\nO f noxious efficacy, and when to join\nIn iynod unbenign; and taught thef x d\n\u2022 Ifaiah xl. 22, 23, &c. + See Joih. x. 12, 13.\u2014 2 Kings xx. ix.\u2014-Johnix# 6, 7. and xi.\n44? 53.\u2014Exod, xvi. 2i, 22.\u2014-Dan, iii. 27.\nG Their\n\f44 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nTheir influence malignant when to iliow'r;\nW hich of them rifing with the fun, or falling,\nShould prove tempeJluous> &c. *\nThe ingenious Mr. Fergufon alfo proves, in a variety of inftances, an\nefficiency and influence in the fun and moon, though he denies that any fuch\nfaculty exifts in the fixed ftars. And yet he has ihewn, by very fatisfac-\ntory obfervations, that \u201c the fixed ftars arc fo many glorious funs, with\nfyftems and worlds furrounding them, fimilar to our own j\u201d and that\n\u20aci the Almighty would not have placed them at fuch diftances from each\nother, without proper objedts were near enough to be benefited by their\ninfluences\u201d Hence it follows, from his own hypothefis, that the fixed\nftars do each of them poflefs a natural -f- influence, homogeneal to the fun\nand moon. But to what diftance the fixed ftars, or any of the heavenly\nbodies, are capable of extending thefe influences, is beyond the power of\nthe moft enlightened mind to deteimine ; fince the celeftial matter flows\nthrough a boundlefs and unlimitted fpace, and operates upon every fub-\nftance that falls within the line of its diredtion. And now, having made\nit apparent, by an union of concurrent teftimonies, that the fun, moon,\nand ftars have their refpedtive influences, and that an Aftrology in the\nheavens does by confequence exift, it will be proper to confider, how far\nthe ftudy of this noble fcience is compatible with our moral and religi\u00ad\nous obligations, and what degree of it is attainable by the human un-\nderftunding.\nThat the ftudy and practice of Aftrology, is a moral purfuit, becoming\ni\\ber and religious men, m aybe collected from the cuftoms of the an\u00ad\ncients in all enlightened countries ; as well as from the beft and wifeft of\nCod's chofen people. And that our all-wife and beneficent Creator,\noriginally implanted in the frame of nature, a means whereby mankind\nmay attain to the knowledge of fuch future contingencies as concern their\nwelfare and happinefs, is in no refpedt to be doubted, fince we obferve\nin the brute creation, that even the moft inconliderable creatures upon\nthe earth, are more or lefs endowed with a gift of foreknowledge. Thus\nthe induftrious bee, and laborious J ant, lay in their fummer ftore, to\nfupply the necefiary wants of an inclement winter, which they foreknow\nis\n* See Par?.dife Loft, b. x. 1. 656. f See Fergufon\u2019s Aftronomy, 6th edit. 8vo.

The wifdom of the ant is confpibuous in forming thcmfelves\ninto a kind of republic, and therein obferving, as it were, their own peculiar laws and po\u00ad\nlicies ; but the cunning of the fpider feems to exceed that of moft other infers; its various\nartifices to enfnare its prey, is no lefs remarkable than its contrivance of a cell or retreat\nbehind its web, where it feafts upon its game in fafety, and conceals the fragments of thoib\ncarcales it has devoured, without expoiing to public view the Icaft remains of its barbarity,\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 45\nis yet to come. The badger, the hedge hog, and the mole, alio pro\u00ad\nvide themfelvcs a magazine of plants and herbs, which they foreknow will\nenable them to lie concealed in their holes, during the hard frofts o f\nwinter, contented with their prifon, which affords them fafety. Their\nholes are alfo conftru&ed with amazing art, and have generally two ap~\npertures, that in cafe one is befet by an enemy, they may efcape by tne\nother. The doublings of the hare, and the tricks of the fox, to efcape\nthe hounds, are alfo aftonifhing indications of forefight and fagacity.\nThe feathered race are likewife endowed with a fimilar faculty, and often\nforetel an approaching ftorm a confiderable time before it appears, by re\u00ad\ntiring in flocks to their holes and hiding places for ihelter and protection.\nThe birds of paflage feem to inherit tnis gift in a moll remarkable de\u00ad\ngree; for they aflemble together in prodigious flocks, at an appointed\nhour, and take their leave of us before the approach of winter, which\nthey forefee will deftroy the flies and other infers, upon which their own\nlife depends, as they feed upon nothing elfe. And it is no lefs extraor\u00ad\ndinary than true, that thefe birds return as early as the fun brings forth\nthis clafs of infeils into new life; and they have alfo the fagacity to find out\nand repoflefs their former nefts and * habitations. The fame provident\nJorecaji, for felf-prefervation and fafety, is even extended to the innumer\u00ad\nable inhabitants of the immenfe ocean, where we fee the fillies, prefled\nby unceafing hunger, indiferiminately prey upon one another, the large\nupon the fmall, even of its own fpecies; whence the fmaller fiih, in re\u00ad\ngular gradations, when in danger of being devoured, fly for an aflylum\nto the (hallow waters, where they know their enemy cannot, or dares not\npurfue them. And this purfuit of one fpecies of fiih after another, is by\nno means confined to a Angle region; for we find ihoals of them purfu-\ning one another, f*om the vicinity of the pole, even down to the equator;\nand thus the cod, from the banks of Newfoundland, purfues the whiting,\nwhich flies before it, even to the fbuthern ihores of Spain. It is aftonifil\u00ad\ning alfo that herrings, which appear to generate towards the north of Scot\u00ad\nland, regularly make their way, once a year, to the Britiih Channel.\nTheir voyage is conduced with the utmoft regularity; and the time of\ntheir departure is fixed from the month of June to Auguft. They always\naflemble together before they fet out, and no ftragglers are ever found\nwhich might diftinguiih its place of abode, or create the leaft jealoufy in any infe&, that their\nenerrty was near. Into what hiftory can we look, to find people who are governed by laws\nequal to what we obferve in the republic of bees ? What experience can we defire beyond that\nwe obferve in the cunning fpider, to teach us to guard againft the artifices of thofe, who lay\nfnares, to catch the thoughtlefs and unwary?

If we give the feriptures an attentive perufal, we fliall\nfind a variety of pafiages to confirm this opinion, both in the old and new\nTcilamcnt. And we may gather additional evidence, that the Almighty\n1 uended we lliould fludy futurity, from the communications given to\nAdam in Paradife by the angel Gabriel; as W'ell it\ns from the commiiTion M i\u00ad\nchael the Archangel received from God, to iliew him, in a vifion, the\nprincipal events of futurity, from his fall, to the birth, refurredtion, and\naicention of * Chrift. And I think I am warranted to fay, from the\nauthority of our Saviour's own words, that there appears only one event,\nconcerning the human race, which the Deity ever propofed to withhold\nfrom their knowledge, and that is, the time of the lalt and terrible day\nof Judgment. But even of this aw'ful and fecret event, we are promifed\nfome previous intimations, by figns in the fun, moon, J and ftars;\nwhich are the common fignificators of all inferior tranfa&ions of futurity.\nFor this reafon we are told to watch , fo r no man knoveeth the hour when\nthefe things Jhall come ; therefore, thofe who ftudy the fydereal fcience, by\ntheir watchfulnefs of the heavenly bodies, and their capability of difeo-\nvering fuch figns in the fun, moon, and ftars, whenever the tremendous\nfiat fliall be pail, will be the firft to know that the vifitation of God is\nat hand; v\/hilft thofe who condemn both the fcience and its profeflors,\nunprepared by any previous intimation, and folded in the arms of\nincautious repofe, will find the fatal hour approach like a th ief in the\nt See Brookes\u2019s Nat.

We\nhave already fcen that Adam, previous to his expuliion from Paradife, was\ninftrudted in a foreknowledge of futurity, by the exprefs command of\nGod, as a means of enlarging his mind, and alleviating his diflrefs, upon\nbeing turned adrift into the wide world. Jofephus, an hiftorian of cha\u00ad\nracter and eminence, who quotes the moft ancient authors of refpedtability\nfor what he aflerts, confirms the fame thing, and further informs us, that\nAdam, before his death, inftru&ed his fon Seth in this fcience, who after\u00ad\nwards engraved the rudiments of it upon permanent pillars of done, which\nendured through many generations, and were not entirely effaced till fome\ntime after the*deluge. W e have it from the fame authority, that the\nArt was taught by Enos and Noah, who preferved it to the days of Abra\u00ad\nham, and he incrcafed the knowledge of it by divine aids, teaching it to\nthe Chaldeans and Egyptians. Jofeph is alfo faid to have patronized and\n\u00ab\n\u00a7 1 would recommend a ferious and attentive perufal of thefe feriptures, to every perfon who\nhas doubts concerning the do&rine of Aftrology. It is here pointed out, tothe underftanding\nof themoft unlettered part of mankind, that the great and terrible day of the Lord, the day of\njudgment, will moft affuredlv come. Our Saviour\u2019s difciples enquire of him, When this day\nihall be ? He replies, C\n(Of tnat day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which arc\n4\n4 in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only.\u201d They alfo aik, What fhail be the figns\nhereof? They are told, 4\n4There ihall be figns in the fun, in the moon, and in the ftars ; the\n' fun ihall be darkened, and the moonihall not give her light; and upon the earth diftrefs of\nnations, with perplexity ; the fea and the waves roaring; with great earthquakes indivcis\nS\nlaces, and famines, and peftilences; fearful fights and great figns ihall there alfo be in the\ncavens. Watch, therefore, for in an hour when ye think not, Ihall thefe things come; for\nas in the days that were before the Hood, they were eating and drinking, marrying, and giv\u00ad\ning in marriage, until the daythat Noah entered the ark; andthey knew not, until the flood\ncame and took them away; foalfo ihall ttie coming of the Son of man be. Then ihall he\nfend forth his angels, and ihall gather together hiseled from the four winds, from the utter*\nmoft part of theearth, to theuttermoft part of heaven; then ihall two be in a field, the one\nihall be taken; andtheother left; twowomenihall be grinding at themill, theone ihall beta\u00ad\nken, andthe otherleft.

Thefefign s ourSaviour informed\nhis difciples ihouldfprecede the deftru&ion of Jerufalem; and aftrologers. and other hiftorians,\nhave borne record of the cxa& completion of this prophecy; andit muft oe felf-evident to eve\u00ad\nry thinking mind, that the laft day will come topafs. exa&Iy in they way our Saviour has de\u00ad\nscribed it.

Mofes afterwards\ntaught and profelled it, independent of the gift of prophecy, which al-\nwa\\s came by divine infpiration, and confequently was only exercifed\nupon certain extraordinary occafions. From Mofes, we are told, the Pro\u00ad\nphets and Seers had i t ; and that it was afterwards particularly taught\namong the tribe of Iflachar, who are on that account ftiled in the facred\nwritings, M en who bad undemanding in the J times, and were expert at re-\nfolving all queiiions concerning futurity; and as this tribe were neither\npriefts nor Levites, nor endued with the fpirit of prophecy, it follows\nthat their underjianding in the times, and their ability in foretelling future\nevents, arofe entirely from an acquired knowledge of the figns and influ\u00ad\nences o f the heavenly bodies. For the fame reafon thePeriian aftrologers\nwere called Mages, or W ife men, who wereJkilled in the tim es; and the\nChaldeans termed their young ftudents in aftrology, M en Jkilled in wifdom\nand cunning ^fcience, to learn the learning o f the Chaldeans. And after the\nChaldean method of ftudying the fcience of aftrology, Daniel, and Shad-\nrach, and Mefech, and Abednego were inftrudted by their tutor Melzar,\nand became ten times more learned in all matters o f wifdom and underfunding,\nthan all the afrologers in the realm, in confideration of which they were\neleiled members of the public * fchools at Babylon, which were founded\nfor the ftudy of this art; and Daniel was made, by the King\u2019s decree,\nMailer over the Chaldean I\nIaftrologers.\nIn the days of Samuel, it appears to have been a common cuftom to go\nto the Seers, or men of underfunding in the times, not only to be inform\u00ad\ned concerning future contingencies, but alip to enquire after loft goods.\nTo this effedt we find Saul and his fervant difeourfing, when they were\nfun out to find the ftrayed afles of Kiih, Saul\u2019s father; and not being able\nto rind them, the fervant propofes to go and enquire of the Seer, which way\nthe afles were gone, and where they may be found. Saul agrees to this, but\nafks, W hat have we to give him ? we have no bread left% nor have we any\nfujficient prefent. The fervant replies, I have a fo u rth part o f a Jhekel o f\n\/\u00a1her ; r i l give him tha t. Saul anfwerS, W ellfa id , let u s** go. This\npaflage enables us to diftinguifh between the gift of prophecy, for the\npurpofes of eftablifhing God\u2019s true religion, and the art of anfwering ho\u00ad\nrary queftions, and predicting future events. The one was evidently ef\u00ad\nfected by fupernatural means, and promulgated to the people without\n%\nf Orig. tom. in Gen. Diod. Sic. lib. i. cap. 2. J 1Chron. xii. 32. \u00a7 Efth. i. 13.

In\nthe fame way we find David, when in Keilah, where he heard that Saul\nwas coming to befiege him, was defirous of knowing the truth, whether\nSaul was coming or n ot; and if he was, W hether the men o f Keilah would\nbe true to bim> or would betray him. And being informed they would\nbetray him into the hands of the enemy, who weie fecking his life, he\nfled into the wildernefs of Ziph, and efcaped the danger that was im\u00ad\npending over -f- him. And in the New Teftament alfo, we have fre\u00ad\nquent confirmations of the meteorological part of this fcience, from our\nSaviour\u2019s own words, in his converfation with the Pharifees, who were\nall verfed in aftrology. He addreifes them to this effeit: \u201c When it is\n\u201c evening, ye fay, it will be fair weather, becaufe the iky is red ; and\n\u201c in the morning it will be foul weather, becaufe the iky is red and\n4t lowering. And when a cloud arifeth out o f the weft, ftraightway ye\n\u20ac\n< fay, A ihower cometh ; and it is fo. And when ye fee the fouth-wind\n\u201c blow, ye fay, There will be heat; and fo it comes to pafs. Ye hy-\n\u20act pocrites, ye can difeern the face of the || iky, but the figns of the times\n\u20act ye cannot d i f e e r n . A n d now, if we impartially contemplate the\norigin and antiquity of this fcience, and recolledt that the beft and wifeft\nmen in every age of the world, were profeflors of it, we muft admit its\npraftice to be highly confiftcnt with all our moral and religious duties.\n*\nThat the human underftanding is alfo capable of attaining to a very\nhigh degree of knowledge in the hidden works of futurity, and in the\nfecret operations of nature, is likewife to be proved, beyond the power\nof contradiction. Indeed the paffages already quoted from the holy\nferiptures, are a fufficient confirmation of it to every difpailionate reader j\nbut as there are fome very extraordinary iflftances of this predictive fa\u00ad\nculty, recorded by different hoftorians, I will juft mention a few of\nthem, by way of corroborating die evidence already brought in its fup-\nport. The Emperor Domitian required the Profeffor Largius Proculus,\nto calculate his nativity, from the fuppofed time of his birth, which was\ndone, and delivered into the Emperor\u2019s own hands. Afclatarius, a molt\nfamous aftrologer of thole times*, procuring a copy of this nativity, rec-,\ntilled it, and foretold the hour and manner of the Emperor\u2019s death; which\nwhen Domitian heard, he commanded. Afclatarius to be brought before\nhim, when he affirmed his predictions would prove true. Domitian alk-\ned him if he could foretel the manner of his own death ? Afclatarius re\u00ad\nplied, That he knew he Ihould ftiortly be tom in pieces by dogs \u2022\n, but to\nconfute the aftrologer, the Emperor ordered him to be burnt alive. The\ncruel fentence was accordingly put in execution ; the body was bound and\n1 1 Sam.xxui. 10, 11,12,13,14. 1 SeeMatt. xvi. 2, 3. Lukexii. 24, 53, \u00a16;\nlaid\n\f5o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nlaid upon the pile, and the fire kindled ; but at that inftant, there arofe a\ndreadful ftorm of wind and rain, which drove the fpedtators away, and\nextinguiihed the fire ; and Afclatarius was afterwards torn in pieces by\ndogs, as he had foretold. When Latinus informed the Emperor of this\nevent, he was greatly mortified, and very melancholy ; and on the day his\naffaffination had been predi&ed, he feigned himfelf indifpofed, and locked\nhimfelf up in his chamber. Stephanus, the captain of his guard, went to\nhis door, pretending he had received fome important difpatches, which\nhe wanted to deliver to him ; but Domitian declining to admit him till a\ncertain hour was pail, Stephanus perfuaded him it was then much later\nthan the time fpecified. The Emperor, in confequence, concluding the\ndanger to havepaffedby with the hour, or looking upon the predi&ion as a\nmere fable, feeing no confpiracy or danger about him, opened the door,\nupon which Stephanus ftept up to him with a drawn dagger, and ilabbcd\nhim to the heart, in the very hour that had been predicted by the aftro-\nloger, on the eighteenth day of September, the monthjhe had ordered to\nbe called* Germanicus. The fame writers add, that Apollonius Tyaneus\nwas at that iiiftant of time at Ephcfus, flanding in the prefence of the\nMagiftratcs, and in a kind of ecftacy, cried out, O Stephanus, ilrike the\ntyrant; and after a paufe, added, *Tis well, thou haft killed him. This art\no f redifying nativities, was a difeovery which brought the fcience to very\nliigh perfedion, and has enabled its profeffors to be aftoniihingly exad in\npr\u00e9dirions o f confequence. Thus Lucius Tarutius Firmianus, by the\nads of Romulus's life, and the time o f his death, found that he was born\nin the firft year of the f\u00e9cond Olympiad, the twenty-third day of the\nmonth, about fun-riling. And hence he difeovered that the building of\nRome was begun when the moon was in Libra, the fun with Mercury, and\nVenus in Taurus, Jupiter in Pifces, and Saturn with Mars in -f* Scorpio.\nThe Archbiihop o f Pifa confulted fcveral different profeffors of aftrology\nconcerning his deftiny, and they all calculated his nativity at different\ntimes, and without any communication with one another ; but they all\nforetold him he would be hanged. It feemed highly incredible at the\ntime, becaufe he was in fomuch honour and power; but the event juftified\nthe predictions ; for in the fcdition of Pope Sextius IV . in the fudden\nrage and uproar of the people, he was lcized and $ hanged. Petrus\nLeontius, a celebrated phylician and aftrologerof Spoletanum, call his own\nnativity, and foretold that his death would be occalioned by water, and\nmany years afterwards he was found drowned in a pond, into which he had\nfallen the preceding night, by miftaking his \u00a7 way. Jofephus tells us\nhe caft the nativities o f Vefpatian, and his fon Titus, and predicted that\nthey would both be Emperors ; and fo it turned out. R . Cervinus\n* Vid. Sueton. in Domitian. f Vid.

And he was afterwards really\nmade Pope *. Picus Mirandula was a fevere writer againft aftrology,\ninfomuch that he was termed, Flagellum Aftrologorum; and to ftop the\nmalignity of his pen, Lucius Bcllantius, and two other aftrologers of\neminence, procured the time of his birth, and calculated his nativity,\nwhich they afterwards fent him, with this predidtion inclofed, \u201c That he\nwould die in the thirty-third year of his age.\u201d This exafperated him fo\nmuch, that he began to write a new tradt, with inconceivable afperity,\nagainft the poor aftrologers, attempting to prove their calculations a mere\nbubble, and themfelves a fet of impoftors. But when the fatal ap\u00ad\npointed hour arrived, he faw the folly of his own conceits; recanted his\nopinion, and fealed by his death, a {landing memorial of the inerrability\nand truth of this -fcience. Many other extraordinary circumftances of\nthe kind might be related from different authors, were it not already\nfufficiently obvious that the intelledtyal faculties of man, when culti\u00ad\nvated by ftudy, and improved by obfervation and experience, are capable\nof attaining a very exteniivc degree of knowledge and ikill in this art.\nW e w ill therefore difmifs this argument, and endeavour to explain what\nthe fubjedls are, that the fcience of aftrology naturally comprehends.\nAftrology is compounded of Jlar, and difcourfey and literally\nimplies, l!he doctrine o f the J ia rs; teaching how to judge of their effe&s,\nand fecret influences, and to foretel future events, by the order of their\ndifferent afpedts, qualities, and pofitions ; and alfo how to difeover their\nenergy and force upon earthly fubftances, in the wonderful and abftrufe\noperations o f nature. It comprehends the moft excellent part of that\nnoble fcience called Phyfiology, or natural Philofophy, which is the doc\u00ad\ntrine o f natural bodies, in the conftrudtion of the works of nature. T he\nbody natural may be conceived either generally, as one perfett and entire\nbody; or ipecially, as it may d>e divided into two, or fubdivided into\nmany thouiand component parts. This grand and perfedt body of na\u00ad\nture is called the World, or the whole world, which is generally confi-\ndered as making but one entire body; but this general body admits o f\nmany fpecial divilions and fubdivifions -\ny and is firft divided into two\n* Vid. Thuan. 1. 1j. It is remarkable that this prtdidion was printed at Venice, and pub-\nlifhed by Curtins Trojanus, in a book of nativities written by Gauricus, upwards of three\nyears before Marcellas Cervinus was proclaimed Pope. And this is that Pope, who when the\nLc&urer, as the cuftom was, read a certain portion of the writings of the Fathers at dinner\ntime, faid, \u201c He could conceive how thofc who held fo high a place, could provide\nfor their own falvation,\u201d\nl branches,\n\f$2 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nbranches, making one body natural called Celeftial, and another called\nTerreftrial; and hence arife two diilindt fciences, the one termed U ri\u00ad\nnology, and the other Geology.\nGeology is a fcience treating of the natural body called the earth, and\nfpeaks either generally of the whole earth, or fpecially of the parts, or fome\n(^articular part thereof; and is either fpcculativc, or pradtical. Specu-\native Geology confifts in the fimple inveftigation of the earth, either\nin whole, or in part, and of the principles and afiedtions thereof; and to\nthis purpofe it treats either of the common being of any earthly thing,\nmerely as it is a being abftradt from all matter, whether intelligible, or\nfenfible; and as it operates thus, it is termed Metaphyfical, or Preter\u00ad\nnatural Philofophy. But if it difcourfcs of a movable being in matter,\nand that as it is perfedtly material, it is then called Natural Philofophy.\nOr if it fpeaks of things converfant in matter intelligible, but not fen-\niible, as they are the abftradts of matter, it is named Mathematical, or\nAbftradt Philofophy. O f this fort of fcience the fubjedt is Quantity,\nand is either continued, or dilcreet. If of continued quantity, it is\ncalled Geometry, or its fubordinate, Perfpedtive; but if the quantity be\ndifcreet, it is then termed Arithmetic, or its fubordinate, Mufic. Na\u00ad\ntural Philofophy properly fo called, treats of terreftrial bodies, either\nfimple or mixed. The fimple bodies confift of the four elements,\ncalled Fire, Air, Earth, and Water, which occupy all places from the\nutmoft and inferior bodies of the heavenly matter, unto the inmoft cen\u00ad\ntre of the earth; fo that vacuum no where exifts under the cope of\nheaven. The mixed bodies are compounded of thefe four elements, and\nare divided into animate, and inanimate bodies. And all animate bodies\nare endued either with a vegetive, fenlitive, or rational faculty. Now\nwhile we ftudy the dodtrine of this earthly body natural, the fciences of\nGeography, Hiftory, and Chronology, naturally flow from it ; the firft\no f which deferibes the fituation and boundaries of the different parts of\nthe earth ; the fecond relates the ftory of whatever has been feen or\ntranfadted upon i t ; and the third computes and adjufls all the different\n;m s and portions of time, from the creation of the world, to the pre-\nfent hour. And fubordinate to thefe are Topography, or a defeription of\nparticular places, and Chronologies of certain diftindt periods of time.\nPradtical Geology, is that part of natural philofophy which confifts in\nSpeculation, for the profit and advantage of mankind ; and leaves a track\nor fruit of its operation remaining, when the adt itfelf is paft and gone.\nAnd this is a fort of ftudy claifed under die denomination of Art, rather\nthan of Science. The fubjedt of it muft be either Man himfelf, or fome\nfubordinate fubftance. If Man be the fubjedt of inveftigation, then the\nobjedt will be to teach him precepts of morality; and this we call\nEthical\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 53\nEthical Philofophy; or elfe to inflrudt him in the Art of Reafoning, called\nLogical Philofophy ; or in the Art of Speaking, which we term Gram\u00ad\nmatical, or Rhetorical Philofophy. But if the Speculation be upon any\nfubordinate fubftance, then the Earth itfelf, or the productions of it,\nbecome the fubjedt of investigation. If it be the Earth, then the bufi-\nnefs we contemplate, is to improve and cultivate the foil, for the cn-\ncreafe of ufeful vegetation, which is called Agriculture ; but if it be the\nproductions of the earth, then the ftudy muft be fo to prepare and manu\u00ad\nfacture them, as to render them the eifentials of Health, W ealth, Food,\nor Cloathing; or whatever elfe is conducive to the comforts or neceffi-\nties of mankind. And thefe are feverally diftinguifhed by as many iig-\nnificant Terms, as there are occupations or employments, by the inven\u00ad\ntion and ufe of which all thefe things are produced.\nUranology is a Science which treats of the natural body of Heaven,\nafter the fame manner as Geology deferibes that of the Earth ; and fpeaks\neither generally, of the whole Heaven ; or fpecially, of fome particular\nor diftindt part of it. And as Uranology is a part of Phyfiology, fo has\nit the fame principles, whether internal, as Matter and Form ; or ex\u00ad\nternal, as the caufes Efficient and Final j and thefe are Principles of their\nown nature;* as Chance and Fortune are Principles by accident. It hath\nalfo affections internal, as Motion and Reft, and Finity and Infinity ;\nand the fame external, as Tim e and Place. Uranology is alfo either\nfpeculative, or practical. Speculative Uranology coniifts in the Ample\nknowledge of the Heavens, either in whole or in part, and of their\nvarious Principles and Affedtions; and to this purpofe it lpeaks of thefe\nthings either Mathematically, or Naturally. Mathematically, it treats\nof Aftronomy, or Uranometry, which is a feience that points out the\nmagnitude, meafure, and motion of the heavens, and of the ftars there\u00ad\nin ; and Naturally, it defines the qualities, motions, afpedts, and opera\u00ad\ntions of the heavenly Bodies, and all their apparent and infenfible in\u00ad\nfluences. Pradtical Uranology is that fublime Art, which being once\nperfedtly known, and rightly underftood, enables a man, by his ikill in\nthe affedtions of the Heavens and heavenly Bodies, to unbofom the rc-\nmoteft tranfadtions of futurity, and to trace the myfterious and moil\nobfeure operations of Nature to their fource; whence he defines the in\u00ad\nnate principles and virtues of all animal, vegetable, and mineral fub-\nftances, and points out their refpedtive uies, for the lafting profit and\nadvantage of mankind.\nHaving thus ihewn what tile word Aftrology imports, and arranged its\ncomponent parts by the rules of Science, it will be feen that its colla\u00ad\nteral branches are lb extenlive and multitudinous, that moil men, of any\nlearning\n\f5\n4 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nlearning or ingenuity at all, are fome way or other converfant in Aftro-\nlogy, without appearing to know it. But 4the perverfenefs of human\nnature is in this inliance moil ftrikingly vifible, fince it leads mankind\nt j a choice of inferior fpeculations, whilft they utterly neglett an invefti-\ngation of thole curious, indi\u00edcernible, infenfible, and impalpable tracks\no f nature, which open to a field of unbounded information, calculated to\nreform the mind, and enlarge the underftanding; and to extirpate the\nfeeds of atheifm, by leading to the moil fublime and heavenly contem\u00ad\nplations of a Supreme Being. The common objettions againil engaging\nin this elevated iludy, are equally abfurd and ridiculous ; but they pro\u00ad\nceed only from thofe men who w ilfully neglett, or obilinately perlift in\na difbelief of Nature\u2019s fecret and imperceptible w orks,* and yet her ope\u00ad\nrations are fo manifeft, and fo often confirmed by fatal experience, that\nit is aftonilhing mankind are not more frequently awakened by them*\nThus wc fee a man inftantaneouily taken off, by a violent and feverilh\ndiitemper, and yet no one can poifibly conceive how or from what caufe\nit proceeds; nor can the moll able phyfician, by any depth of medical (kill,\npoint out its genuine caufe, fo as to fhew that another man under the\nfame fymptoms, fhall be feized with juft fuch another diforder. But\nlook into the lick man\u2019s nativity, by the rules of aftrology, and there\nyou will moll apparently fee the root and caufe of his affliftion. And\nhence wc demonftrably prove, that it was not fo much the effett o f\ncatching cold, or of any accident, which brought on the malady, but\nthe evil influence of fome malignant afpett, that unperceived and unfuf-\npetted gave the fatal blow, while a cold, or fome trifling accident, were\nbut mere inftruments; for another man fhall have a worfc cold, and\nfcarcely find himielf the leaft feverilh, or expofed to danger*\nThus we find aftrology comprehends every operation that proceeds out\no f the mailer-wheel or frame of Nature, and furnilhes us with a know\u00ad\nledge of the occult virtues of all earthly fubftances, and of the nature and\nend of every particle of God\u2019s Creation y and to minds that can relilh\nenjoyments fuperior to thofe of fenfe, nothing can furnilh more noble\nand exalted pleafures, than a contemplation and iludy of thefe immenfe\nw orks; while nothing furely can give greater proofs of an abjett and\ncontracted mind, than to be daily converfant with, and yet ftupidly in-\nl'enlible of the amazing miracles of nature. The fun, moon, and liars,\nwere not made by a wife and beneficent Creator, that the wonders of\nthem ihould open themfelves to eyes that fee not, or difplay their in\u00ad\nfluences unregarded, to the incurious inhabitants of the earth. It was in\u00ad\ndeed principally for the pleafure of Him by whom all things exift, that\nthey are and were created \u00bf who rejoiceth in his works\u2014 in furveying that\nitrutturc which omnipotence alone could raife > but they are likewile de-\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . $s\nfigned to communicate wifdom and happinefs, and intellectual and mo\u00ad\nral improvement to mankind. And to him who is not barely fatisfied\nwith an external admiration o f things, they will fuggeft fuch reflections\nas will make him both wifer and better; for at the fame time that they\nfeaft his imagination, they will enlarge his underftanding, and meliorate his\nheart. Whatever part o f the works of nature we caft our eyes upon, we lhJ)\nfind imprinted therein ample leflons of inftru&ion and improvement.\nW ould we contemplate the inexpreflible greatnefsand majefty of God, let\nus but lookup and furvey the heavens, which are fpread over us like a cur\u00ad\ntain ; they declcCfe the glory o f God, andJhew fo r th his handy work\u2014 they vifi -\nbly ihew it forth to the rude and illiterate; but the mind which is fraught\nwith this compreheniive ftudy, may for ever expand itfelf in the immeniity\nc f the profpeCt. Even the irrational and inanimate part of the creation,\nare held forth by the wifdom of God, to direCt the feeings of Reafon in\nthe way that they ihould g o ; and our Saviour in his parables defeends to\nthe lifelefs emblems of feed fown, of the fig-tree, and of a Angle grain\no f muftard feed, to enlighten the underftanding of mankind* Is it not then\nthe duty of every rational creature to improve by this divine example, and\nby a ftudy of that excellent part o f aftrology called natural philofophy,\nto increafe our imperfeCt Knowledge in the fubjeCts of creation ? Suck\nknowledge as this lies open even to the wayfaring man ; it grows in every\nfield, and meets us in all our paths; and as it is moft important to be\nwell underftood by the reader, before any material* progrefs can be made\nin the ailrology of the heavens, I (hall conclude thefe obfervations with,\na ihort introduction to the ftudy of Nature..\nK A Summary\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y .\nbodies to receive their influence ; therefore every active principle mufl of\nncceflity be in motion, and every paffivc principle mull be at refl. And\naccordingly, as the a&ive elements find the earth that they adt upon\nto be pure, or impure, fo w ill the work be that is produced. The\n- earth can bring forth nothing o f itfelf, but is the womb or matrix into\nwhich the other elements diftil or projedt their feminal virtues; and in\nproportion as it is impregnated\u2019 by their force and energy, it brings forth,\naccording to the due courfe of nature. The Earth alfo receives the ce-\nleftial rays and influences of all the heavenly bodies, as ordained by God,\nto be the objedt, fubjedt, and receptacle of them; whereby it not only\nbrings forth what is intended to be produced, but alfo multiplies what\nit receives, and feparates the good from the bad, and the pure from the\nimpure. It likewiie contains the feeds or feminal virtues of all elemen\u00ad\ntary bodies, and hath a triplicity in itfelf, viz. mineral, animal, and ve-\ngetive. It is the common fountain or mother from whence all things\nipring, whofe fruitfulnefs is produced by the three-fold operation of fire,\nair, and water. And as thefe elementary bodies poflefs moil extraordi\u00ad\nnary qualities, it will be proper to confider each of them diitindtly, and\nto explain their feveral properties more at large.\nFire, the firil adtivc element, is an elaitic body, compofed of infinite\u00ad\nly fmall particles, fcarcely, if at all, adhering to each other, and a body in\nmotion. It is in effedt, the univerfal inilrument of all the motion and\nadtion in the univerfe; without fire, all bodies would become immove\u00ad\nable, as in a fevere winter we adtually fee our fluids become folid for want\no f it. Without fire a man would harden into a ftatue, and the very air\nwould cohere into a firm rigid mafs. Fire then is the foie caufe of all\nmutation or change; for all mutation is by motion, and all motion by\nfire. Upon the abfence of only a certain degree of fire, all oils, fats,\nwaters, wines, ales, fpirits of wine, vegetables, and animals, become\nhard, rigid, and inert; and the lefs the degree of fire, the fooner is this\ninduration made. Hence, if there were the greateil degree of cold, and\nall fire was abfolutely taken away, all nature would grow into one con\u00ad\ncrete body, folid as gold, and hard as diamond; but upon the re-ap\u00ad\nplication of fire, it would recover its Former mobility. So that upon\nthis one element of fire, depends all fluidity of humours and juices; alfo\nall vegetation, putrefadtion, fermentation, animal heat, and a thoufand\nother things. Fire is in itfelf but one, though it centers in divers places.\nIt centres in the heavens, and is boundlefs, where it guards and pre-\nferves nature, and enlivens all the creation, giving life, light, and mo\u00ad\ntion to all creatures, and llirs them up to fecundity and fruitfulnefs. It\ncentres alfo in the earth, where it generates metals, minerals, and (tones;\nand by joining itfelf with the beams of the celeftial fun and moon, pro\u00ad\nduces\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nduces vegetation upon the furface of the earth. It occaiions that heat\nwe fomctimes obferve in fprings and fountains ; and imparts a principle\no f its own into whatever it produces, fo that whatfoever retains life, re\u00ad\ntains it by virtue of its own inclofed heat; and whenever this is exhauft-\ned or extinguiihed, it periihes and dies. And as water purgeth, cleanfeth*\nand diflolveth all things that are not fixed, fo fire purgeth and perfefteth\nall things that are fixed ; and as water conjoins all things that are dif-\nfolved, fo fire feparates all things that are conjoined; it caufes all feeds to\ngrow and ripen; and when they are ripe, it expels them by the fperm\ninto divers places of the earth ; and as the fituation and temperature o f\nthefe places are, whether hot or cold, moift or dry, pure or impure, 'fo\nw ill the diverfity of things be both in the bowels, and upon the furface of\nthe earth. But amongft all the wonderful properties of fire, there are\nnone more extraordinary than this, That though it is the principal caufe\no f almoft all the fenfible efiefts that continually fall under our obferva-\ntion, yet it is in itfelf of fo infinitely a fubtle nature, that it baffles or de\u00ad\nfeats our moil fagacious enquiries, nor ever comes within the cogni\u00ad\nzance of our fenfes. .\nFire may be divided into three kinds or fpecies, viz. celeftial, fubterra-\nneous, and culinary. Celeftial fire is that which.is peculiar to the celeftial\nregions, where it exifts in the greateft purity and perfedtion, unmixed\nwith fmoke, or any of that grofs, feculent, or terreftrial matter, found in\nculinary and fubterranean fire $ but allowing for this difference, the effects\no f the celeftial fire appear to be the fame as thofe of the culinary. Sub\u00ad\nterraneous fire is that which manifefts itfelf in fiery eruptions of the earth,\nvolcanoes, or burning mountains, and is always found in the more central\nparts of the earth, and often in mines and coal-pits. Culinary fire is that\nwhich we employ in all chemical operations, and in the common occaiions\no f life. T o afeertain the force and power of fire, the learned Boerhaave\nmade innumerable curious experiments, which enabled him to divide it\ninto fix degrees. The firft degree is that by which nature performs the\noffice of vegetation in plants, and by which chcmiftry imitates and does\nthe like. This commences from the higheft degree of cold, which in\nFahrenheit\u2019s thermometer is denoted by one, and ends at eighty degrees;\nlince in this whole interval vegetables of one kind or other give indication\nof life and growth; fo that if all plants be examined by the degrees of\nheat contained within thefe limits, we ihall find all of them come to ma\u00ad\nturity in one or other o f thefe intermediate degrees. This heat is fuited\nto extracting the native fpirits o f odoriferous vegetables with oils, as that\nof rofes, jelfamin; and the like. Thus the fragrant feentof rofes maybe\ncommunicated to oil, by putting the inodorous and infipidoil of olives in-a\ntall clean chemical glafs, and digefting it in a heat of fifty-fix degrees,\nwith\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 59\nwith the moil fragrant rofes, gathered juft as they are opening in a morn\u00ad\ning ; the application of a fimilar degree of heat would alfo impregnate\nalcohol with the pureft fpirit of faffron. The fecond degree of fire may\nbe accounted that of the human body, in a healthy ftate. This degree is\nalways greater than that of the ambient aiy* and may be fuppofed to\ncommence at the 40th degree of the thermometer, and end about the\n94th. Within this*compafs animals may live and fubfift, that is, if their\njuices be of any degree of heat within thefe bounds. The eggs of infedls\nfubfift unhurt during hard winters, and hatch in the fucceeding fpring.\nFifties both of the fea and of rivers, live in water which is only thirty-\nfour degrees warm ; and fifties that have lungs, and all refpiring animals\nin a ftate of health, communicate U* their humours a warmth of ninety-two\ndegrees; and therefore the uttttofl limits of this degree are fixed at thirty-\nthree and ninety-four. W ithin the compafs of this heat are included the\nvital aitions of animals, the fermentation of vegetables, and the putre\u00ad\nfaction both of vegetables and animals; and likewife the generation,\nbreeding, hatching, birth, and nutrition of animals. This degree is alfo\nemployed by chemifts to prepare elixirs, volatile alkaline falts, and tinc\u00ad\ntures. The third degree of fire is that which extends from ninety- four\ndegrees of the thermometer to 212, at which laft, water ufually boils.\nThis degree is required in the diftillation of Ample and compound wa\u00ad\nters, the eflential oils of vegetables 5 and will coagulate or consolidate the\nferum, blood, and other animal juices, and confequently deftroy life.\nThe fourth degree of heat may be reckoned from the degree 212 to 600;\nwithin which limits all oils, faline lixivia, mercury, and oil of vitriol are\ndiftilled; lead and tin will alfo melt and mix together. The oils, falts,\nand faponaceous juices of animals and vegetables are rendered volatile and\nacrid, and become more orlefs alealefeent; their folid parts are calcined,\nand lofe their diftinguifhing qualities and proper virtues; and with this\ndegree of fire, foflil fulphur and fal armoniac are fublimed. The fifth\ndegree is that wherein the other metals melt, and which commences from\nfix hundred degrees of the thermometawgnd ends where iron is held in a\nftate of fufion. In this degree moil b o U l are deftroyed; butglafs, gold,\nfilyer, copper, and iron, remain long unchanged * all other fixed bodies\ngrow red hot in this degree, and all the unvitrifiable ilonesare calcined.\nThe fixth and higheft degree of fire hitherto known, is that of the burn\u00ad\ning lens, or fpeculum^ by M . Villette, Tfchirnhaufen, Buffon, and others.\nThe focus o f thefe lenfes will even volatilize what is called the metalline\nor mercurial part of gold, and vitrify the more terreilrial. The utmofl\ndegree of fire is the vitrification of fixed bodies, which the ancient magi,\nor the aitrologers of the eail difeovered j and they predicted the final\nend of the world by fire, and its mutation into tranfparent glafa *\u2022\n\u2666 See Boerhaave's Chenuftry, vo!. i. parts.

Elementary\nair, properly io called, is a lubtile, homogeneous* elailic matter ; the baiis\nor fundamental ingredient of common air, and that which gives it the\ndenomination. It likewi&xnters into the compofition of moft or perhaps\nall bodies, and exifts in them under a folid form, deprived of its elal-\nticity, and moft of its diftinguiihiag properties, and ferving as the ce\u00ad\nment, and univerfal bond of nature; but capable, by certain procefles*\no f being difengaged from them, recovering its elafticity, and refembHng\nthe air of our atmofphere. The peculiar nature of this aerial matter we\nknow but little o f; what authors have advanced concerning it being\nchiefly conjectural. W e have no way o f altogether feparating it from the\nother matter, with which, in its pureft ftate, it is more or iefs combined*\nand confequently no way of afeertaining, with fatisfadtory evidence, its\npeculiar properties, abftradtedly from thofe of other bodies. Philofophers*\nboth ancient andmodern maintain, with great plaufibility, that it is the fame\nwith the pure ether, or that fine, fluid, adlive matter, diffufed through the\nwhole expanfe of the celeftial regions, and of the interior heavens; and\nis fuppofcd to be a body fu i generis, ingcnerable, incorruptible* immuta\u00ad\nble, prefent in all places, and in all bodies. *\nCommon, or heterogeneous air, is a coalition o f corpufclcs of various\nkinds, which together conftitute one common mafs, wherein we live and\nmove, and which we are continually receiving and expelling by refpiration.\nThe whole afiemblage of this makes what we call the atmojphere; and\nwhere this air or atmofphere ends, there the pure ether is fuppofed to\ncommence, which is diftinguiihed from air* by its not making any fenli-\nfcle refradtion of the rays o f light, as air does. T his common air, fays\nthe ingenious M r. Boyle, is the moft heterogeneous body in the uuiverfe ;\nand Boerhaave fhews it to be an univer&l chaos, or colluvies* o f all kinds\nof created bodies. Bcfide the matter of light or fire, which continually\nflows into it from the heavenly Indies, and probably the magnetic effluvia\nof the earth, whatever fire can i\u00ae fcilize, is found in the air. Hence the\nwhole foiffl kingdom muft be found in i t ; for all of that tribe* as falts*\nfulphurs, ftoncs, and metals, are convertible into fume* and thus capable\nof being rendered part of the air. Gold itfelf* the moft fixed of all na\u00ad\ntural bodies, is found to adhere clofe to,the fulphur in mines* and thus to\nbe raifed along with it. Sulphurs alfo make a confiderable ingredient o f\nthe air, on account of the many volcanoes* grottos* caverns* and other\nfpiracles, chiefly affording that mineral* difperfed through the globe. A ll\nparts of the animal kingdom muft alfo be in the air; for* bcfide the co\u00ad\npious effluvia continually emitted from their bodies* by the vital heat* in\nthe ordinary procefs of perfpifation, by means of which an animal* in the\n\u2019 courfc\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 61\ncourfe of its duration, impregnates the air with many times the quantity\nof its own body; we find that \u00abany animal when dead, being expofed to\nthe air, is in a certain time wholly incorporated with it*. As to vegeta\u00ad\nbles, none o f that clafs can be wanting in the contribution of their effluvia\nto the common air, fincc we know that all vegetables, by putrefadtion,\nbecome volatile. The aflociations, reparations, attritions, diffolutions,\nand other operations of one fort of matter upQn another, may likewife be\nconfidered as fources o f numerous other neutral, or anonymous bodies, un\u00ad\nknown to the moil inquifitive naturalift. Thus air is one of the moil con-\n\u2022 This fa\u00a3l is proved in avery ftrtking manner, by anextraordinary effedfcproduced by thofe\ndead bodies, after they became filled with air, which were unfortunately drowned in the Royal\nGeorge, at Spithead, on the 29th of Auguft, 1782. This (hip was heeled on her fide for the\npurpofe of fome repair, when the water ruihed into her lower port-holes, and funk her almoft\njnftantaneoufly. She went down in fourteen fathom water, and fell upon her fide, as was evi\u00ad\ndent from her top-malls, wftich remained above the water, in an inclined dire&ion. A confi-\nderable time after this fatal accident, {he fuddenly righted, and her mads became nearly perpen\u00ad\ndicular. No one could account for this extraordinary tranfa&ion, which was eiFe&ed without\nany apparent caufe; and it remained forfome time a circumftance equally aftonifhing and in\u00ad\nexplicable. At length fome very able anonymous writer publifbed the following ingenious and\ncorrect folution of it.\n\u201c By the mutter-roll of this unfortunate fhip, it appears that 495 fouls periflied between her\n\u201c decks; and as the bodies had no way to eicape, they of courfe remained inthat fituation.\n\u201c Now all bodies in adate of putrefaction ferment, and this fermentation generates largequan\u00ad\ntities of air, fo that a putrifying carcafe, inflated by the generation of air, expands itfelf to a\nfize farexceeding its original bulk, andbecomes lighter than water in a very high degree; and\nwill confequently be preded upwards towards the furface, with a power equal to the weight\nof a quantity of water, adequate in bulk tothe inflated carcafe; and would rife immediately\nto the furface in a perpendicular line, if not obflru&ed in its paflage. Now it is obvious\nthat the 409 carcafes. which lay between the decks until fermentation and putrefa&ion\ncommenced, would rife as foon as the generated air rendered them fpeciflcally lighter than\nfea water: and as fermentation increafed their bulk, they would by their expanfion,\nremove a quantity of water from between the decks, on the loweft fide of the fhip (to\nwhich by their gravity they would naturally incline when their breath firft left them)\nequal to their encrealed bulk; apd being then a&ed upon by the upwardprefiure of the\nwater, would exert agaiqft the under-part of the decks, immediately over them, a power like-\nwife equal to fuch weight of water as.equate their eneveafed bulk. The hewieft fide\nof the ihip, being thus firft lightened by the displacing fo largea quantity of water, and\nexchanging it for air\u00bf and then a&ed upon by the \u2019preflure of the water upwards againfl the\nunder fide of the inflated carcafes, lifting hard agaimftthe decks on or beneath the center of\nthe ihip; and farther by the preflure of the water upwards, againft the underfide of the\nhulls, mails, &c. together with the counterpoife of a large weight of water between decks\u00bb\non the higheft fide, would caufe her to be nearly inEquilibrio; and confequently, the firft\nftroQg tide (as was the cafe) would fwing her onher keel, andright her.\ntc To ihew that 49$ bloatedcarcafes mighthave power fufficient to produce fo ftrange a phe\u00ad\nnomenon, let us fuppofb each carcafe\u00bft that time equal to a twenty gallon cafk, ana it could\nbe nolets, for when in aftateof putrefa&ion, notonly the abdomen.andthorax\u00bbbut even the\nfmalleft veil'd in the human frame, becomes inflatedby the vapourgeneratedin fermentation;\nfo that the limbs fwell to the extremities, and become buoyant, which makes the eftimate of\ntwenty gallons per carcafe lefs perhaps than the truth.\n\u201c Then 49$ thenumber of carcafes iuppdfed to have remained between the\n20 MdeckSfbeingmultiplicity ao. thenumberofgallonsincreafedin\n\u201c each carcaTe, which divided by 2^2, the number of gallons\n*\n*\n* contained in a ton liquid meafure, quotes 39 tons 72 gallons,\n\u201c which multiplied by 3, to anfwer the treble power, make\nnear 118 tons; a difference of weight between the two\nfides fully fufticient, with the sffliftance of a fpring tide, to\n* r\n* V i\nf.\n\u201d 7 *\n39 7*\n3\nTons, 3 hhds* 27 gal.\nM\n\u201c lift the ihip to a balance, which the tide, though ever fo\n\u201c ftrong, could nothave effected without it.\u201d _ _^\n\f62 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nfulciuble and univerfal agents in all nature, being concerned in the prefer-\n\\<ition of life, and the production of moil of the phenomena relating to\nthis world. Its properties and effects, including a great part of the re-\nK.tubes and difeoveries* of the modern philofophers, have in a confiderable\ndegree been reduced to Jtfgcife laws and demonftrations ; in which form\nthey make a very exteenye and important branch of the mixed mathe\u00ad\nmatics, called Pneumatics; for a moreperfedt knowledge of which, I beg\nleave to recommend the curious reader to Dr. Prieftley's invaluable E x\u00ad\nperiments and Obiervations on different kinds of air. But I iliall juft\nobierve further, that to the preflure of air, we arc to attribute the cohe-\nience of the parts of bodies. Breathing too, on which depends animal\nhfe, is owing to the preflure and ipring of the air; and to the fame\ncaufe may be attributed the production of fire and flame, as appears from\nt h e h i d d e n extinction of Are when deprived of air. It is likewife necef-\niary for the exiftence and propagation of founds, for the germination and\ngrowth of plants, for conveying all the variety of fmells, and for re\u00ad\nceiving and tranfmitting the rays and influences of the celeftial world, to\nthe terreftrial. Air adts upon all bodies by its common properties of\nweight and elafticity, and by the peculiar virtues of the ingredients where\u00ad\no f it is compoled. Thefe properties of weight and elafticity in the air,\nwhen engendered in large quantities in the bowels o f the earth, and\nheated bv the fubterranean fire, occafions earthquakes, and other vehe\u00ad\nment commotions of nature. And by fome late experiments of M . de la\nHire, it is found that a certain quantity of condenfed air, if heated to a\ndegree equal to that of boiling water, will produce an explofion fuffi-\ntient to tear afunder the folid globe. By means of a corroding acid, air\ndiffolves iron and copper, unlefs well defended by o il; even gold in the\nchcmift's laboratory, when the air is impregnated with the effluvia of aqua\nregia, cgpptra&s a ruft like other bodies. It Axes volatile bodies, and vo\u00ad\nlatilizes thofe which are fixed. From the different effluviae diffufed\nthrough the air, proceed a variety of effefts. Near mines of copper, it\nwill difcolour filver and brafs; and in London, where the air abounds\nwith acid and corrofive particles, metalline utenfils ruft much fooner than\nin the country. Stones alfo undergo the changes incident to metals.\nThus Purbeck Atone, of which Saliibury cathedral is built, is obferved\nto become gradually fofter, and to moulder away in the air; and M r.\nBoyle gives the fame account qf Blackington ftone. It is very difficult\nto obtain oil o f fulphur in a clear dry air, as its parts are then more ready\nto evaporate ; but in a moift cloudy air, it may be obtained in ^f^idance.\nA ll falts melt moft readily in cloudy weather; and fejparations priSfeibd belt\nin the fame ftate of the air. I f pure wine be carried into a place where the\nair is full of the fumes of wine then fermenting, it will begin to ferment\na-frefh. The wholefomenefs and unwholefomenefs of .air, is certainly\n. owing\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 6;\nv\"\nowing to the different effluvia with which it abounds. The heft air is to\nbe found in open champaign countries\u00bb where the foil is dry, and fpon-\ntaneo'ufly produces wild thyme, wild marjoram, and the like fweet-\nfcented plants. The morning air is more refrtihing than that of the even\u00ad\ning, and air agitated with breezes, than tfcatfWhich is ferenc and ftill.\nAs good air contributes greatly to health, fi^that which is bad or in-\nfe&ious, is no lefs prejudicial to it, as is evident in contagious difeafes,\nplagues, murrains, and other mortalities, which are fpread by an infetted\nair. But this infeiled air may be corredted, and the body preferved frctn\nits fatal effects, by the effluvia of aromatic and ftrong-fcented herbs and\nflowers. From obfervations on bleeding in rheumatifms, and after tak\u00ad\ning cold, it is evident the air can enter with all its qualities, and vitiate\nthe whole texture of the blood, and other juices. From palfies, verti\u00ad\ngoes, and other nervous affe\u00a3tions, caufed by damps, mines, &c. it is\nevident that air thus qualified, can relax and obftrutt the whole nervous\nfyitem. And from the cholics, fluxes, coughs, and confumptions pro\u00ad\nduced by damp, moift, and nitrous air, it is evident it can corrupt and\nfpoil the noble organs of the whole human ftrufture. Thus air is an\ninftrument which nature is universally applying in all her works \u00a7, con-\nfequently a knowledge of its properties feems highly neceffary not only\nto the chemift and phyfician, but to the philofopher and divine.\nWater, the third aftive element, is the menftruum of the world, and\nis of two kinds; firft, Pure Water, which is a limpid, and colourlefs li\u00ad\nquor, without fmell or tafte, Ample and volatile, and is peculiar to the\nceleftial regions. Secondly, Grofs Water, which is a pellucid fluid, con\u00ad\nvertible into ice by cold, naturally pervading the ftrata of the earth, and\nflowing on its furface, and with* the body of the earth, conllitutes the\nterraqueous globe. The figure of the component parts of water appears\nto be fmooth and fphcrical, like thofeof quicklilver; whence it becomes\nextremely moveable and penetrating. Thus it readily enters the pores o f\nwood, leather, lkins, chords, and mufical firings, and is capable of\nmoving and agitating particles of matter lefs adtive than itfe lf; and fo\nproves the more immediate phyfical agent of fermentation, putrefaction,\nfolution, and the lik e ; and thiis it alfo conveys earthy and faline matter\nthrough filtres of paper, ftone, &c. and even raifes fome proportion of\nthem in diftillations. Its particles appear to be extremely minute, and\nfo have a large fhaie of furface. Hence water is admirably fitted for a\n\u00a7 For more on this important fubjc& fee Hales\u2019s Vegct.

It penetrates ^tmofphere very copioufly, by means of the\ncontinual dillillations of thtrpcean and rivers, raifed up by the heat of\nthe central fun, and draws along with it a warm undtious vapour, which\ncaufes a natural generation of whatever the earth, as a matrix, is impreg\u00ad\nnated with. Water always contains an earthy fubftance, and is found in\nthe hardeft bodies, and in the drieft air. It is the proper menftruum\nof falts, and by the readinefs with which it imbibes the different\nkindsof air, iseafily rendered, by a lately diicovered chemical procefs, to\npoiTefs the lame qualities and virtues of the moft efteemed mineral waters\nhitherto difeovered. Water is alfo of infinite u\/e in all the works both\no f nature and art, as without it there could be no generation, nutri\u00ad\ntion, or accretion performed in any of the animal, vegetable, mine\u00ad\nral, marine, or atmofpherical regions. The blood could not flow in the\nveins, the fap in the veflels of vegetables, nor the particles of minerals\nconcrete andjjrow together, without water. It is this that makes the\nlargeft part of our blood, our drink, and other aliments. There could\nbe no corruption, fermentation, or diffolution carried on without i t ; no\nbrewing, no diftilling, no wines, no vinegar, no fpirits, made without\nit. W e alfo meet with water under an infinite variety of forms, and in an\ninfinite variety of bodies, as that of air, vapour, clouds, fnow, hail, ice,\nfap, wines, blood, fleih, bone, horn, ftone, and other bodies, through\nall which it feems to pafs unaltered, as an agent or inftrument that fuf-\nfers po alteration by re-adtion, but remains capable of refuming the form\nof water again upon any occafion. In its own common ilate, water ap\u00ad\npears to be a combination of all the elements together, as containing a\nquantity of fire, which keeps it fluid; a quantity of air, and a quantity\nof earth; whence it is not at all furprifing, that water alone, as it appears\nto the fenfes, fhould fuffice for vegetation in fome cafes, where little\nearth is wanted, or for iupporting animal and mineral life, .where no great\ndegree of nutriment is required; and hence it proves a glue or cement to\nfome bodies, and a folvcnt to others; thus it confolidates brick, plaifter\no f Paris, itone, bone, and the like; but diffolves falts, and fubtile earth\napproaching to falts, and becomes the inftrumental caufe o f their adtion.\nWater alfo conveys nourishment, or a more fixed and folid matter to the\nparts of vegetables, where having depofited it, the finer fluid perfpires\ninto the atmofphere, which gives us the phyfical caufe of the dampnefs and\nunwholefomenefs of woody countries, as they remarkably find in America.\nFor all large vegetables aft after the manner of forcing-pumps, continu\u00ad\nally drawing in large quantities of water at their roots, and difeharging\nit\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . ' 65\nit at their leaves ; which intimates a method of colleding water in dry\ncountries, and likewife of making fait water frefh. It is alfo obferva-\nble, that water in pafting through plants, after having depolited its more\nterreftrial part, does not always go off pure, but impregnated with the\nfiner effluvia, or more fubtile particles o f the vegetable ; thus making an\natmofphere around every plant according to its nature, odoriferous or o-\ntherwife, which fupplics us with a rule for procuring the odoriferous\nwaters of vegetables by diftillation. But the particles, not fine enough\nto go off thus along with the water, are left behind upon the furface of\nthe leaves and flowers of plants, being now thickened or itrained from\ntheir moifter parts, and remaining in the form of honey, manna, gums,\nor balfains, according to the nature of the vegetable. And hence we\ndeduce the phylical caufe why plants prove more odoriferous and fweet\nwhen the air is both warm and moift, as is the cafe immediately after a\nfummer fhowcr. Water is likewife of the utmoft ufe in divers of\nthe mechanical arts and occafions of life, as in the motion of mills,\nengines, fountains, and all other machines which ad by the -f- laws of\nHydroftatics.\nThe fourth element, which is paiflve and fixed, is Earth, and conflits\nof a limple, dry, and cold fubitance ; and is an ingredient in the compo-\nfition of all natural bodies. It muft beobferved, that pure native earth*\nis a very different matter from the earth whereon we tread, and this pure\nearth is fuppofed to be the bafis, or fubftratem of all bodies, and that\nwherein the other principles refide. It is all that is folid in an animal,\nor vegetable body, all the real vafcular parts, the reft being juices. This\nearth may be found in and feparated from all animal and vegetable fub-\nfiances, and is the fame in all, and is the bafis of all. It remains after\nthe feparation of the other principles by chemiftry, from all animal and\nvegetable fubftances, and neither coheres together, nor fuffers any change\nin the fire. The affayers acknowledge no difference between the earth o f\nanimals and vegetables, but make their tefts for the niceft ufes equally o f\nboth. If water be poured upon this earth, it acquires fome degree of te\u00ad\nnacity, fo as to become capable of being formed into veflels ; but if oil\nbe added, it coheres into a much Jtronger and more compad mafs -, hence\nit appears that oil and earth are the principles which give confiftence and\ntenacity to plants. This oil, as well as this earth, feems the fame in all,\nand poffeffes nothing of the poifonous or medicinal virtues of the plant,\nor whatever it is extraded from ; they being all feparable by decodion,\ndiftillation, and other procefles of that kind, and never remain* either in\nt For the further properties and effc&s of Water, fee Defag.

It may alfo be obtained\npure and unmixed horn the common clafs of vegetables and other bodies,\nby letting the remaining mafs, after diftillation, be thoroughly calcined,\nthen boiled in leveral waters to get out all its fait, and after this dried\nin a clear fire, or in the fun ; and this dried mafs will be pure | earth.\nThus, from the different qualities and operations of the four elements\nupon one another, we may ohferve, that the fire preferves the earth\nfrom being overwhelmed or deftroyed by water ; the air preferves the fire\nthat it is not extinguiihed; and the water preferves the earth, that it is\nnot burnt; but if either of thefe adtive elements were to become predo\u00ad\nminant in any great degree, the world would be deitroyed ; as was the\ncafe at the time of the deluge, by the predominancy of water.\nO f thefe four elements the' whole terreitrial world is compofcd, with\nall its productions and appendages; and over thefe Man hath the do\u00ad\nminion, as God\u2019s vicegerent upon earth, being compounded of the moil\nperfedt and noble part of earthly matter, and formed after God\u2019s own\nimage and likenefs. Hence Man is called the Microcofm, from\nlittle, and **<\n7**-, 'world, literally fignifying, the little world, which is ap\u00ad\nplied to Man by way of eminence, as being an epitome of all that is excel\u00ad\nlent and wonderful in Nature.\u2019 If we attentively confider the ftrudture\nand faculties of man, we fhall clearly perceive his exiitence upon earth,\nin a charadter fubordinate to that of angels, is only intended by the Deity\nfor a ftate of probation 3 and as this corporeal life ihall terminate, either\nin adts of piety, or profanenefs, fo ihall follow the retributions of an im\u00ad\npartial and juft Judge, in a future ftate of everlafting duration. Man is\ncompofcd of three diftindt effences, Spirit, Soul, and Body ; as St. Paul\nevinces when he fays, L e t your Spirits, Souls, and Bodies be kept blame-\nle\/s at the coming o f the L ord fe fu s C hrijl. And thefe three effences are\ncompounded of the three leffer worlds; the Soul of Man is lormed of the\nethereal world ; the Spirit, of the celeftial w orld; and the Body, of the\nelementary world.

For thefenfual, ce\u00ad\nleftial part of man, is that whereby we move, lee, feel, tafte, and line!!,\nand have a commerce with all material objeds; and through thefe the\ninfluences of the divine Nature are conveyed to the more refined and\nlenfible organs. This celeftial fpirit aduates and influences the elemen\u00ad\ntary eflencc, and ftirs it up to the propagation of its like, and to every other\npurpofe for which Nature defignedit. And this fpirit is even difcoverablc\nin herbs and flowers, which open when the fun rifes, and clofe when he\nfets; which motion is produced by the fpirit being fenfible of the approach\nand departure of the fun\u2019s influence. N ext to thefe, in Man, ihines that\npure, etherial, angelic part, called the rational foul; which is a divine\nlight or ftream flowing immediately from the Great Creator, uniting\nMan with God, and railing him above all other parts of animated na\u00ad\nture. This Soul, when once it enters the body, runs parallel with\neternity ; and joins in with the celeftial fpirit, through the fphere of the\nplanets; and is conduded by a divine Genii, to an hypoftatical union\nwith the elementary body; fo that there exifts two adive principles in\nthe body of man, to one pafive; and as the Superior Rules in the celef\u00ad\ntial world are fituated at the time o f man\u2019s nativity, fo will his confti-\ntution and difpofition be framed. And here we derive the caufe of all\nthofe aftoniihing variations of temper, difpofition, and conftitution, which\nare not only peculiar to different lubjeds, but even to one and the fame\nperfon; for every one will bear teftimony of this fad, that we find our-\nielves fometimes chearful, and at other times melancholy; to day in perfed\nhealth, and to-morrow in pain and anguifh ; this hour compofed, affa\u00ad\nble, and complacent, and the next auftere, petulcnt, and peremptory 5\nand thefe contrarieties, are evidently produced by the continual rcfiftance\nand oppofition of the four elements in man\u2019s body, whiqh alternately dif-\npofe him to the various affedions difcoverablc in human nature. - The\ncaufe of this is deduced from the natural enmity of the elementary mat\u00ad\nter, viz. heat and cold, and drinefs and moifture ; each of which occa-\nfionally predominates in man\u2019s body, according to the motion and influ\u00ad\nence of thofe heavenly bodies, th$t rule, govern, and modify the operation\nof the four elements, in and upon every terreftrial fubftance. Thus it is\nevident, that the underllanding and intelledual faculties of Man are form\u00ad\ned of the ethereal w orld; the fenfitive powers of life and adion are derived\nfrom the celeftial world ; and the grofs and corruptible part, the flefh and\nblood, confifts of the elementary world ; which are all fubordinate the\none to the other. Under this idea of the workmanihip and conftrudion\nof Man, Job exclaimed, that he was fearfully and wonderfully made;\nin poffefling the three-fold effences, 01 fpirit, foul and body*\nN Sceptical\n\f68 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nSceptical and atheiftical writers, indeed, have attempted to overturn this\nfyftem of nature in the conftrudion of man, by denying the immortality\no f the foul, and a future diftribution o f rewards and punifhments ; con\u00ad\ntending that the foul is an indivifible parr of the body, and has its diffo-\nlution in the common courfe o f mortality. But thefe tenets are fo ex\u00ad\ntremely abfurd, fo vague, and fo deftitute o f evidence, that the rational\nmind is at a lofs to conceive how fuch an inconfiftent dodrine could have\never been broached ; for, the fame philofophical reafoning that enables us\nto define the nature and exiftence of the body, will like wife prove the\nnature and exiftence of the foul. It is only from the primary or eflential\nqualities of body, its cxtenfion, and folidity, that we form any idea of\ni t ; and whv may we not form the complex idea of a foul or fpirit, from\nthe operations o f thinking, underftanding, willing, and the like, which\nare experiments in ourlelvcs ? This idea of an immaterial fubftance, is as\nclear as that we have of a material one ; for though the notion o f imma\u00ad\nterial fubftances may be attended with difficulties, we have no more\nreafon to deny or doubt of its truth, than we have to deny or doubt\no f the exiftence o f the body. That the foul is an immaterial fub\u00ad\nftance, appears from hence\u2014 that the primary operations of willing and\nthinking, are not only unconneded with the known properties of body,\nbut feem plainly inconfiftent with fome of its moft eflential qualities.\nFor the mind not only difeovers no relation between thinking, and the\nmotion and arrangement of parts; but it likewife perceives, that conciouf-\nnefs, a fimple ad, can never proceed from a compounded fubftance, ca\u00ad\npable of being divided into many parts. T o illuftrate this, let us only\nfuppole a fyftem of matter endowed with thought; then, either all the\nparts of which this fyftem confifts muft think, which would make it\nnot one, but a multitude of diftind confcious beings; or its power of\nthinking muft arife from the connexion o f the parts one with another,\ntheir motion, and diipofition, which, all taken together, contribute to the\nprodudion of thought. But it is evident, that the motion o f parts, and\nthe manner of combining them, can produce nothing but an artful ftruc-\nture, and various modes of motion. Hence all machines, however artful\u00ad\nly their parts are put together, and however complicated their ftruc-\nture, though we conceive innumerable different motions, varioufly com\u00ad\nbined, and running one into another with an endlefs variety, yet ne\u00ad\nver produce any thing but figure and motion. I f a clock, or watch, tells\nthe hour and minutes of the day, it is only by the motion of the different\nhands, pointing fucceffively at the different figures marked upon the\nhour-plate for that purpofe. W e never imagine this to be the effed o f\nthought or intelligence, nor conceive it poflible, by any confinement of\nftrudure, fo to improve the compofrtion, as that it ihall become capable\no f knowledge and confcioufnefs; and the reafon is plainly this, that\nthought\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . Cf\nthought being fomething altogether different from motion and figure,\nwithout the leafl connexion between them, it can never be fuppofed to\nrefult from them. This then being evident, that intelligence cannot\narife from an union, or combination of unintelligent parts; if we fuppofe\nit to belong to any fyilem o f matter, we mufl necefiarily attribute it to\nall the parts of which that iyflem is compofed; whereby, inflead o f one,\nwe fhall, as was before obferved, have a multitude of diilindt confcious\nbeings. And becaufe matter, how far foever we purfue the minutenefs\no f its parts, is itiil capable of repeated divilions, even to infinity, it is\nplain that this abfurdity will follow us through all the iuppofitions that\nmake thought inherent in a material fubilance. Wherefore, as cunfci-\noufnefs is incompatible with the cohefion of folid feparable parts, we are\nneceffarily led to place it in fome other fubilance of diilindl Nature and\nProperties\u2014 and this fubilance we call Spirit, which is altogether diilindt\nfrom body, nay, and commonly placed in oppofition to i t ; for which\nreafon, the beings of this clafs are called immaterial; a word that im\u00ad\nplies nothing of their true nature, but merely denotes its contrariety to\nthat of matter, or material fubilances*\nAs to the immortality of the human foul, the arguments to prove it\nmay be reduced to the following heads; firil, The nature of the foul it-\nfelf, its defires, fenfe of moral good and evil, and gradual increafe o f\nknowledge and perfedtion; and fecondly, The moral attributes of God.\nUnder the former of thefe confiderations, it is apparent that the foul, be\u00ab*\ning an immaterial intelligent fubilance, as has been already proved, does\nnot depend upon the body for its exiitence; and therefore may, and ab*\nfolutely mufl exifl after the body, unlefs annihilated by the fame power\nwhich gave it a being at firil, which is not to be fuppofed, fince there are\nno inflances o f annihilation in nature. This argument, efpecially if the\ninfinite capacity of the foul, its flrong defire after immortality, its ra\u00ad\ntional adlivity and advancement towards perfedlion, be likewife confidered,\nwill appear perfedtly conclufive to men o f a philofophical turn ; becauie\nnature, or rather the God of nature, does nothing in vain. But argu\u00ad\nments drawn from the moral attributes o f the Deity, are not only better\nadapted to convince men unacquainted with abflradl reafoning, but equally\ncertain and conclufive with the former 5 for as the juflice of God can\nnever fuffer the wicked to efcape unpunifhed, nor the good to remain\nalways unrewarded; therefore arguments drawn from the manifeft and\ncontinual profperity o f the wicked, and the frequent misfortunes and un-\nhappinefs of good and virtuous men in this life, mull convince every\nthinking perfon, that there is a future flate wherein all will be fet right,\nand God's attributes of wifdom, goodnefs, and juflice, fully vindicated.\nHad the religious and confcientious part of mankind no hopes of a future\nftate, they would be of all men the moll miferable $ but as this is abio-\n\u201c lutely\n\f7 \u00d4 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nlutely inconliilent with the moral character of the Deity, the certainty o f\nfuch a Hate is clear to a demonilration.\nThus far we have confidered the elementary world, which is the lowelt\nin dignity; and man, the chief fubjedt thereof. The celellial world*\nwhich is next in eminence, is conilituted of a body natural, moll Ample,\nfpherical, clear, fluid, and moving conilantly in a circle, and this by virtue\no f an innate power always within itfelf; comprehending and containing\nthe fun, moon, planets, and ilars, fixed in diftindt orbs by the great A r\u00ad\nchitect of Nature, and bearing fympathy with all terreltrial fubftances, as\nbeing formed out of the fame chaotic mafs, at the beginning of the world.\nThis ccleilial heaven is what Mofes calls the firmament, which was\nthe work of the fecond day\u2019s creation, and literally lignifies an expanfe o f\nextenfion; a term very well adapted by the prophet to the impreflion\nwhich the heavens make on our fenfes; whence in other parts of the\nScriptures, the heaven is compared to a curtain, or a tent ftretched out to\ndwell in. Through the medium of this ccleilial world, and the heavenly\nbodies therein contained, the fupreme Being rules, governs, and actuates\nthe elementary world ; and this is apparent, becaufe that thing which we\nterm obedience, is only to be found in elementary bodies. And fince mo\u00ad\ntion is the caufe of all mutation and change, and as all motion originates\nwith the heavenly bodies, by the revolutions of which even Time itfelf\nis meafured out and divided, fo we find thefe celellial influences produce\nall the variations of heat and cold, drynefs and moiiture, generation and\ncorruption, increafe and decreafe, life and death, and all the viciffitudes\no f nature, without even varying themfelves, or being fubjedt to the leall\nchange or alteration ; whilil the elementary bodies are perpetually chang\u00ad\ning, and never continue in one flay. Hence it is apparent that the celei-\ntinl bodies are active, and the elementary paffive; lo that the ccleilial bo\u00ad\ndies give the form and ilamp to all the productions of nature, and the ele\u00ad\nmentary bodies fubminiftcr matter to receive this form. And as the pollu\u00ad\ntions and affections of the heavenly afpedts are when this form or ilamp\nis given j and as the quality of the elementary matter ihall be when fubmi-\nniilered, fo will the nature and quality of the fubjedt be, that receives this\ncelellial form or Ilamp. And were it not for this active and paflive prin\u00ad\nciple, then would all elementary things be alike, without a poflibility of\nexiiling. It is, therefore, a perfedl knowledge of this mediate or celef-\ntial world, its various affections and difpolitions, the nature, tendency*\nand effect of the luminaries, their motions, afpedts, and pofitions, which\nenable us to judge of future contingencies, and to difeover the fecret and\nabitrufe operations of nature: But to attain this knowledge in any com\u00ad\npetent degree, we mull trace thefe heavenly intelligencers throughout the\nwhole celellial regions, and acquaint ourfelves with their general and\nefiential\n\f\f\f\fOF A S T R O L O G Y . 71\neflential qualities. I ihall for this purpofe, after treating of the ethereal\nworld, make this fpeculation a leading clue to the art of calculating\nnativities.\nThe Etherial world, which is the fuperior, and the higheit in dignityv\nis that which the infpired writers, and the ancient philofophers, called the\nEmpyrean Heaven, and is conceived to be the abode of God, and bleffed\nfpirits, of angels, and the fouls of the righteous departed ; .wherein the\nDeity is pleafed to afford a nearer and more immediate view of himfelf,\na more fenfible manifeflation of his glory, and a more adequate per\u00ad\nception of his attributes, than in the other parts of the univerfe, where he\nis likewife prefent. But the moft exalted conceptions we can poffibly\nform of this blifsful abode, are extremely inadequate and imperfedl ; nor\nis. it in the power of the moft enlarged underftanding to frame fuitable\nideas of the Godhead, or of the angelic hoft that perpetually furround his\nthrone. As much, however, as the human compreheniion is able to con '\ntain, the Almighty has been gracioufly pleafed to reveal to us in the Scrip\u00ad\ntures, by the infpired writers, particularly Ifaiah, Ezekiel, and St. John\nthe Divine, who have given us very magnificent deferiptions of the hea\u00ad\nvenly maniions, their ftrudture, apparatus, and angelic attendance* FronT\nthis divine Revelation the Hebrew writers, and other learned men, have\ndeferibed the Harmony of the Univerfe, and the neceffary fubordination\nand dependence of one thing upon another, from the interior heaven, to\nthe remoteft corner of the earth. W e ihall therefore prefume to follow\nthefe authors in fpeaking of God and his angels ; and whoever fufhciently\ncontemplates the fubjedt, will be fecure againft the impious dodtrines o f\nAtheifts, of Free-thinkers, of immoral and irreligious men.\nGod is an immaterial, intelligent,and free Being; of perfedt gofcdnefs,\nwifdom, and pow er; who made the univerfe, and continues to fupport\nit, as well as to govern and diredt it by his providence. By his imma-\nteriallity, intelligence, and freedom, God is diftinguifhed from fate, na\u00ad\nture, deftiny, neceffity, chance, and from all other imaginary beings.\nIn feripture, God is defined by, I am that I am; Alpha and Om ega;\nthe beginning and end of all things. Among philofophers, he is de\u00ad\nfined a Being of infinite perfedtion ; or in whom there is no defedt\nof any thing which we conceive might raife, improve, or exalt his na\u00ad\nture. Among men, he is chiefly confidered as the firft caufe, the firft\nBeing, who has exifted from the beginning, has created the world, or\nwho fubfifts neceflarily, or of him ielf; and this knowledge o f God, his\nnature, attributes, word, and works, with the relations between him\nand his creatures, make the extenfive fubjedt of Theology, the filler\nfeience o f Aftrology.\nO Sir\n\f72 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nSir Ifaac Newton confiders and defines God, not as is ufually done,\nfrom his perfection, his nature, efciftence, or the lik e ; but from his\ndominion. The word God, according tp him, is a relative term, and\nhas a regard to fervants ; it is true it denotes a Being eternal, infinite, and\nablolutely perfect 5 but a Being, however eternal, infinite, and abfolute-\nly perfect, without dominion, would n6t be God. The fame author\nohlerves, that the word God, frequently fignifies Lord; but every lord is\nnot God ; it is the dominion of a fpiritual being or lord, that conftitutes\nG od; tine dominion, true G od; fupreme, the fupreme ; feigned, the\nfalfe god. From fuch true dominion it follows, that the true God is\nliving, intelligent, and powerful ; and from his other perfections, that\nhe is iupreme, or fupremely perfect: he is eternal, and infinite ; om\u00ad\nnipotent, and omnilcient; that is, he endures from eternity to eternity,\nand is prefent from infinity to infinity. He governs all things that exift,\nand knows all things that are to be known ; he is not eternity, nor infi\u00ad\nnity, but eternal, and infinite; he is not duration or fpacc, but he en\u00ad\ndures, and is prefent; he endures always, and is prefent everywhere;\nand by exifting always, and every where, he conftitutes the very thing,\nduration and fpace, eternity and infinity. He is omniprefent, not only\nvirtually, but alfo fubftantially; for power without fubftance cannot fub-\nfift. All things are contained, and move in him, but without any mutual\npaflion; he fuffers nothing from the motions of bodies ; nor do they un\u00ad\ndergo any refiftance from his omniprefence. It is confeifed that God ex-\nifts neceflarily; and by the fame neceflity he exifts always, and every\nwhere. Hence, alfo, he rtfuft be perfedly fimilar; all eye, all car, all\nbrain, all arm, all the power of perceiving, underftanding, and adting ; but\nafter a manner not at all corporeal, after a manner not like that of men,\nafter a manner wholly to us unknown. \u2018H e is deftitute of all body, and\nall bodily ihape; and therefore cannot be feen, heard, or touched ; nor\nought to be worihipped under the reprefentation of any thing corporeal.\nW e have ideas of tne attributes o f God, but do not know the fubftance\neven of any thing; we fee only the figures and colours of bodies, hear only\nfounds, touch only the outward furfaces, fmell only odours, and tafte\ntaftes; but do not, cannot, by any fenfe, or any reflex adt, know their\ninward fubftances; and much lefs can we have ,any notion of the fub\u00ad\nftance o f God. W e know him by his properties, and attributes; by the\nmoil wife and excellent ftructure of things, and by final caufes; but we\nadore and worihip him only on account of his dominion; for God, fet-\nting afide dominion, providence, and final caufes, is nothing elfe but fate\nand * nature. , .\n1\nThe admirable metaphyfician and divine, Dr. Clarke, has demonftrafced\nthe being o f a God, with thatclearneis and force o f reafoning, for which\n? See Newton\u2019s Philof. Nat. Prinoip. Math, in calce.\nhe\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 73\nhe is fo eminently diftinguilhed, by a feries of propoiitions, mutually con-\nncfted and dependent, and forming a complete and unanfwcrable argu\u00ad\nment in proof o f the attributes o f the Deity. Something, he fays, has\nexifted from all eteftiity; for, fince famething now is, fomething always\nw as: othetwife the* things that now are, mull have been produced out of\nnothiiig, abfohitely and without caufe, which is a plain contradiction in\nterms. There mull have exifted from all eternity fome one unchangeable\nand independent B eing; or elfe, there has been an infinite fucceffion of\nchangeable and dependent beings, produced one from another in anendlefs\nprogreflion, without any original caufe at all. For without, this feries of\nbeings can have no caufe of its exiftence, becaufe it includes all things that\nare or ever were in the univerfe; nor is any one being in this infinite fuc-\n0611100 felf-exiftent or neceflary, and therefore it can have no reafon of its\nexiftence within itfelf; and it was equally poflible, that from eternity\nthere Ihould never have exifted any thing at all, as that a fucceffion of fuch\nbeings ihould have exifted from eternity. Confequently their exiftence\nis determined by nothing; neither by any neceffity in their own nature,\nbecaufe none of them are felf-exiftent; nor by any other being, becaufe\nno other is fuppofed to exill.\u2014 That unchangeable and independent Being,\nwhich has exifted from eternity, without any external caufe of its exif\u00ad\ntence, muft be felf-exiftent; it mull exift by an abfolute neceffity origi\u00ad\nnally in the nature of the thing itfelf, and antecedent in the natural order\no f our ideas to our fuppofition of its being. For whatever exifts, muft\ncither come into being without a caufe ; or it muft have been produced\nby fome external caufe; or it muft be felf-exiftent: but the two former\niuppofitions are contrary to the two firft propoiitions. From this laft\npropolition it follows, that the only true idea of a felf-exiftent or necef-\niarily exifting being, is the idea of a being, the fuppofition of whofc non-\ncxiftence is an exprefs cotHfodidion $ and this idea is that of a moll fimple\nbeing, abfolutely eternal and infinite, original and independent. It fol\u00ad\nlows alfo, that nothing is fo certain as the exiftence o f a fupreme inde\u00ad\npendent caufe; and likewife, that the material world cannot poffibly be\nthe firft and original being, uncreated, independent, and of itfelf eternal;\nbecaufe it does not exift by an abfolute neceffity in its own nature, fo as\nthat it muft bean exprefs contradidlion to fuppofe it not to exift. W ith\nreipedt both to its form and matter, the material world may be conceived\nnot to be, or to be in any refpedl different from what it is, without a con\u00ad\ntradiction. The fubftance or effence of the felf-exiftent being is ablo-\nlutely incomprehenfible by us ; neverthelefs, many of the effential attri-\nbute$ of his nature are ftridtly demonftrable, as well as his exiftence.\u2014\n\u2022The felf-exiftent being, having no caufe of its exiftence but the abfolute\nneceflity of its own nature, muft of neceffity have exifted from everlaft-\ning, without beginning; and muft of neceffity exift to everlafting, without\nend.\u2014 The felf-exiftent being mull of neceffity be infinite and omnipre-\nk n t .\n\f74 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nfent. Such a being muft be every whdre, as well as always unalterably\nthe fam\u00bf. It follows from hence, that the felf-exiftent being muft be a\nmoft limpie, unchangeable, incorruptible being* without parts, figure,\nmotion, divifibility, and other properties of matter, which are utterly in-\nconfiftent with complete infinity. The felf-exiiteintt being mull of necef-\nfity be but one; becaufe in abiblute neceflity there can be no difference\nor diveriity of exiftence; and\/ \u00bfherefore, it is abfolutely impoffible, that\nthere ihould be two independent felf-exiftent principles, fuch as God and\nmatter.\u2014 The felf-exiftent and original caufe o f all things muft be an in\u00ad\ntelligent being. This propofition cannot be demonftntted ftridtly and\nproperly a p rio ri; but a pojleriori, the world affords undeniable argu\u00ad\nments to prove that all things are the effedts o f an intelligent and know\u00ad\ning caufe. The caufe muft be always more excellent than the effedt; and,\ntherefore, from the various kinds of powers and degrees o f excellence and\nperfection, which vilible objedts poffefs; from the intelligence of created\nbeings, which is a real diftindt quality or perfedtion, and not a mere ef\u00ad\nfect or compofition of unintelligent figure and motion ; from the variety,\norder, beauty, wonderful contrivance, and fitnefs of all things to their pro\u00ad\nper and refpedtive ends; and from the original of motion, the felf-exiftent\ncreating being is demonftrated to be intelligent. The felf-exiftent and\noriginal caufe of all things is not a* neceffary agent, but a being endued\nwith liberty and choice. Liberty is a neceifary confequent of intelli\u00ad\ngence; without liberty, no being can be faid to bean agent, or caufe of\nany thing ; fince to adt neceflarily, is really and properly not to adt at all*\nbut to be adted upon. Befides, if the fupreme caufe be not endued with\nliberty, it will follow, that nothing which is not, could poffibly have\nbeen ; that nothing which is, could poffibly not have been; and that no\nmode or circumftance of the exiftence of any thing, could poffibly have\nbeen in any refpedl otherwife than what it nef# adiually is. Farther, if\nthere be any final caufe in the univerfe, the fupreme caufe is a free agent;\nand on the contrary fuppofition, it is impoffible that any effedt ihould be\nfinite; and in every effedt, there muft have been a progreffion of caufes in\ninfinitum, without any original caufe at all.\u2014 The felf-exiftent being, the\nfupreme caufe of all things, muft of neceflity have infinite power; fince all\nthings were made by him, and are entirely dependent upon him ; and all\nthe powers of all things are derived from him, and perfedtly fobjedfc to\nhim ; nothing can refift the execution of his w ill.\u2014 The fupreme caufe\nand author of all things muft o f neceflity be infinitely wife. This fol\u00ad\nlows from the propofitions already eftabliihed ; and the proof a pofieriori,\nof the infinite wifdom of God, from the coniideration o f the exquilite\nperfedtion and confummate excellency of his works, is no lefs ftrong and\nundeniable.\u2014 The fupreme caufe and author of all things muft of neceflity\nbe a being of infinite goodnefs, juftice, and truth, and all other moral\nperfedtions; fuch as become the fupreme governor and judge of the\nworld.\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y , 75\nworld. The will of a being, infinitely knowing and wife, independent and\nall-powerful, can never be influenced by any wrong affeftion, and can ne\u00ad\nver be miilead or oppofed from without; and, therefore, he muft do\nalways what we know fitted: to bo done; that is, he muft aft always ac\u00ad\ncording to the ftrifteft rules o f infinite goodnefs, juftice, and truth, and\nall other moral perfections; and, more particularly, being infinitely and ne-\nceflarily happy and all-fufficient, he muft be unalterably difpofed to do\nand to communicate good or *happinefs.\nT o this more abilrufe argument a priori, for the exiftence of God, we\nmay add another, more generally obvious, and carrying irrefiftible con-\nviftion, which is deduced from the frame o f the world, and from the\ntraces of evident contrivance and fitnefs of things for one another, that;\noccur through all the parts of it. Thefe confpire to prove, that the ma\u00ad\nterial world, which in its nature is originated and dependent, could not\nhave been the effeft of chance or neceffity, but of intelligence and defign.\nThe beautiful, harmonious, and beneficial arrangement of the various bo\u00ad\ndies that compofe the material fyftem j their mutual dependence and fub-\nferviency; the regularity of their motions, and the aptitude of thefe mo\u00ad\ntions for producing the moft beneficial effefts; and many other pheno\u00ad\nmena refulting from their relation, magnitude, lituation, and ufe, afford\nunqueftionable evidences of the creating power and wife difpofal of an in\u00ad\ntelligent and almighty agent. The power of gravity, by which the ce-\nleftial bodies perfevere in their revolutions, deferves our particular confi-\nderation. This power penetrates to the centre\u00ab of the fun and planets,\nwithout any dimunition of it9 virtue, and is extended to immenfe dis\u00ad\ntances, regularly decreafing, and jSfodiiting the moft fenfible and impor\u00ad\ntant cffefts. Its aftion is proportibnal to the quantity of folid matter in\nbodies, and not to their furfaces, as is ufual in mechanical caufes; and,\ntherefore, feems to furpaf9 mere mechanifm. But however various the\nphenomena that depend on this power, and may be explained by it, no\nmechanical principles can account for its effefts ; much lefs could it have\nproduced, at the beginning, the regular fituation of the orbs, and thepre-\nfent difpofition of things. Gravity could not have determined the planets\nto move from weft to eaft, in orbits nearly circular, almoft in the fame\nplane; nor could their power have projefted the comets, with all the va\u00ad\nriety of their direftions. If we fuppofe the matter of the fyftem to be\naccumulated in the centre by its gravity, no mechanical principles, with\nthe afliftance\u2018of this power, could* feparate the huge and unweildy mafs\ninto fuch parts as the fun and plimets; and, after carrying them to their\ndifferent diftances, prbjeft them in thdr feveral direftions, preferving ftill\nthe equality of aftion ahd1re-attioni or the ftate of the centre of gravity of\n\u2022 See Clarke\u2019s Demonilration of the Being and Attributes of God*\n. P the\n\f7 6 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe fyftem. Such an exquifite ftrudture of things could only arife from\nthe contrivance and powerful influences of an intelligent, free, and molt\npotent agent. The lame powers, therefore, which at prefent govern the\nmaterial world, and conduct its various motions, are very different from\nthole, which were necefiary to have produced it from nothing, or to have\ndifpoled it in the admirable form in which it now proceeds.\nBut we fhould exceed the limits of our plan, if, confining our obferva-\ntion to the earth, our own habitation, we were to enumerate only the\nprincipal traces of defign and wifdom, as well as goodnefs, which are dif-\ncernible in its figure and conftituent parts, in its diurnal and annual mo\u00ad\ntion, in the polition of its axis with regard to its orbit, in the benefit\nwhich it derives from the light and heat of the fun, and the alternate vi-\ncillitudcs of the fealons; in the atmolphere which furrounds it, and in\nthe different fpecies and varieties of vegetables and animals with which\nit is replenifhed. No one can furvey the vegetable produdions of the\nearth, fo various, beautiful, and ufcful, nor the various gradations o f\nanimal life, in fuch a variety of fpecies, all preferved diftindt, and propa\u00ad\ngated by a fettled law, each fitted to its own element, provided with pro\u00ad\nper food, and with inftindts and organs, fuited to its rank and lituation,\nand eipecially with the powers of fenfation and lelf-motion, and all more\nimmediately or remotely fubfervient to the government and ufe of man,\nwithout admiring the ikill and deiign of the original Former. But thefe\nare more fignally manifefted in the ftrlidture o f the human frame, and in\nthe noble powers and capacities of the human m ind; more efpecially in\nthe moral principles and faculties, which are a diftinguiihing part of our\nconftitution, and lead to the perception and acknowledgment of the ex\u00ad\nigence and government o f God. In thofe inftances that have now been\nrecited, and a variety of fimilar inftances fuggeited by them, or naturally\noccurring to the notice of the curious and refle&ing mind, contrivance is\nmanifeil, and immediately, without any nice or fubtle reafoning, fuggeils\na contriver. It ftrikes us like a fenfation ; and artful reafonings againft\nit may puzzle us, without lliaking our belief. No perfon, for example,\nthat knows the principles of optics, and the ftrudture o f the eye, can\nbelieve that it was formed without ikill in that fcience; or that the ear\nwas formed without the knowledge of founds; or that the male and fe\u00ad\nmale, created and preferved in due proportion, were not formed for each\nother, and for continuing the fpecies. A ll our accounts of nature are full\no f inftances of this kind. The admirable and beautiful ftrudture of\nthings for final caufes, exalt our idea of the contriver; and the unity o f\ndeiign fhews him to be one. The great motions in the iyftem, performed\nwith the fame facility as the leaft, fuggeft his almighty power, which,\ngave motion to the earth and the celeftial bodies, with equal eafe as to\nihe minuteft particles; the fubtility of the motions and adtions in the\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y , 77\ninternal parts o f bodies, fhews that his influence penetrates the inmofl\nrecedes of things, and that he is equally aCtive and prefent every where.\nThe fimplicity of the laws that prevail in the world, the excellent difpo-\nlition of things, in order to obtain the beft ends, and the beauty which\nadorns the works of nature, far fuperior to any thing in art, fuggeit his\nconfummate wifdom. The ufefulnefs of the whole fcheme, fo well con\u00ad\ntrived \u00a3\n0\n1* the intelligent beings who enjoy it, with the internal difpofition\nand moral ftruCture of thole beings, fhews his unbounded goodnefs.\nThefe are arguments which are fufliciently open to the views and capa\u00ad\ncities of the unlearned, while at the fame time they acquire new ftrength\nand luflre from the difeoveries of the learned. The Deity\u2019s adtingand in-\nterpofing in the univerle, ihew that he governs it, as well as that he formed\nit; and the depth of his counfels, even in conducing the material univerfe,\nof which a great part furpafles our knowledge, tends to preferve an inward\nveneration and awe o f this great Being, and difpofes us to receive what\nmay be otherwife revealed to us concerning him. HiseiTence, as well as\nthat of all other fubltances, is beyond the reach of all our difeoveries ;\nbut his attributes clearly appear in' his admirable works. W e know that\nthe higheft conceptions we are able to form of them, are (till beneath his\nreal perfections; but his dominion over us, and our duty towards him,\nare abundantly * manifeil.\nAnother fubftantial argument to prove the exiftence of God, as the\ncreator and governor of the univerfe, may be deduced from the univerfal\neonfent of mankind, and the uniform tradition of this belief through\nevery nation and every age; it is impoffible to conceive, that a fallacy,\nfo perpetual and udtvcrfal, fhould be impofed on the united reafon of man\u00ad\nkind. No credible and fatisfaCtory account can be given o f this univerfal\neonfent, without aferibing it to the original conftitution of the human\nmind, in confequence of which it cannot fail to difeern the exiftence of a\nDeity, and to the undeniable traces b f his being, which his works afford.\nFear, ftate-policy, and the prejudices of education, to which the concur\u00ad\nrence of mankind in this principle has been fometimes refolved, are founded\non this univerfal principle, fuppofe its being and influence, and are actuated\nby it. It is much more reasonable to imagine, that the belief of a God\nwas antecedent to their operation, than that it fhould have been produced\nby them; and that it was dictated by reafon and confcience, independent\nof the paflion and .policy of men. The uniform and univerfal tradition\nof this belief, and of the creation of the world by the divine power, af\u00ad\nfords concurring evidence both of the principle and of the faCt. The\nexiftence of God is alfo farther evinced by thofe arguments which have been\nufually aliedged to prove, that the world had a beginning, and, therefore,\n* See Maclaurin\u2019s Account of Sir Ifaac Newton's Phi). Difc. b. iv. chap. g. Baxter in his\nMatho, Derham, Ray, Nieuwentyt, De laPluchc in his Nature difplayed, Chamb. Cyclop. & c.\n\f78 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthat it muft have been created by the energy of divine power. In proof\nof this, the hiitory of Mofes, coniidered merely as the moil ancient hifto-\nrian, deferves particular regard. His teilimony is confirmed by the moil\nancient writers, among the heathens, both poets and hiilorians. It may\nbe alfo fairly alledged, that we have no hiftory or tradition more ancient\nthan that which agrees with the received opinion of the world's begin\u00ad\nning, and of the manner in which it was produced; and that the moil\nancient hiitories were written long after that time. And this confidera-\ntioii is urged by Lucretius, the famous Epicurean, as a ftrong prefumption\nthat the world had a beginning:\n------ Si nulla fuit genitalis origo\nTerrarum & cceli, femperque seterna fuere :\nCurfupra bellum Thebanum, & funera Trojse,\nNon alias alii quoque res cecinere poetae ?\nBefides the origin and progrefs of learning, and the moil ufeful arts,\nconfirm the notion of the world's beginning, and of the common sera o f\nits creation; to which alfo may be added, that the world itfelf, being\nmaterial and corruptible, muil have had a beginning ; and many pheno\u00ad\nmena occur to the obfervation o f the aftronomer and mathematician,\nwhich furniih a ftrong prefumption, that it could have had no long du\u00ad\nration, and that it now gradually tends to diffolution. From thefe con-\niiderations we may infer the abfolute being and providence of G od ;\nwhich alfo demonllrate the exiftence of his angels and miniftring fpirits,\nwho are the meffengers of his will, and the proper inhabitants of the\nethereal world, and confequently the next fubjedts of our enquiry.\nAn Angel is a fpiritual, intelligent fubftancc, and the firft in rank and\ndignity of all created beings ; though the word A ngel, is not pro\u00ad\nperly a denomination of nature, but of office; denoting a mejfengery or\nexecutioner of the will of fome fuperior power or authority. In thisfenfe\nthey are frequently mentioned in Scripture, as miniftring fpirits fent by\nthe Almighty to declare his will, and to corredt, teach, reprove, and com\u00ad\nfort. God alfo promulgated the law to Mofes, and appeared to the old\npatriarchs by the mediation of angels, who reprefented him, and fpoke\nin his name. The exiftence of angels is admitted in all religions ; the\nGreeks and Latins acknowledged them under the names of genii and\ndemons; and in the Alcoran we find frequent mention of them; the\nprofeifors of the Mahometan religion affigned them various orders and\ndegrees, as well as different employments, both in heaven, and on earth.\nThe Sadducees alfo admit their exiftence; witnefs Abufaid, the author of\nan Arabic verfion of the Pentateuch; and Aaron, a Caraite Jew, in his\ncomment on the Pentateuch ; both extant in manufeript in the king of\nFrance's library. The heathen philofophers and poets were alfo agreed as\nto the exiftence of intelligent beings, fuperior to man; as is ihewn by\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 79\nSt. Cyprian, in his treatife on the vanity of idols, from the teftimonies\nof Plato, Socrates, and Trifmegiihis. Authors are not fo mnnimous\nabout their nature as of their exiftence; Clemens Alexandrinus believed\nthey had bodies, which was.alfo the opinion of Origen*, Caefarius, Ter-\ntullian, and feveral others; but Athanafius, Bafil, Gregory, Nicene,.\nCyril, and Chryfoftom, hold them to be mere fpirits. Authors\nare alfo divided as to the time of the creation of angels ; fome will have\nit to have been before the creation of our world, or even from eternity;\nwhile others maintain that they were created at the fame time with our\nworld. The moft probable conjedture is, that they were created at 'dif\u00ad\nferent periods, whenever it pleafed the Almighty to call them into ex\u00ad\niftence. But, though we cannot fo clearly demonftrate the* precife nature\nand duration of angels, we may neverthelefs conclude, fhat, though they\nare of an order highly fuperior to that of men, yet are they not complete\nand perfedl; for, had they been created thus originally, they could not\nhave fallen, as Adam did, nor have finned, which the feriptures inform\nus fome of them did by rebelling againft the Alm ighty, and in contend\u00ad\ning with him for fupreme authority. For this rcafon, as they are them-\nfelves imperfedt beings, they can in no one refpedt be confidered- proper\nobjedts of human adoration, which we are bound to pay alone to that\nO ne Su p r e m e , who is omnipotent, immortal, infinite, the fource.\nand centre of every thing that is great, and good, and perfedt.\nTheologifts have divided angels into different ranks or fubordinations,\nwhich they term Hierarchies, from *\nip\no\n<\n\u00bb holy, and rule, fignifying,\nholy command, or to rule in holy things. Dionyfius, and other ancient\nwriters, have eftablifhed nine choirs or orders of thefe ccleftial fpirits,\nnamely, feraphim, cherubim, thrones, dominions, principalities, powers,\nvirtues, angels^and archangels; and thefe they form into three Hierarchies,\nappointing them their refpcctive offices in the performance of adoration\nand praife, and in executing the word and will of Ged. The Rabbins\nand Jewifh writers, who had obvioufly a more immediate knowledge of\nthe angelic hoft, by the inlpiration of their prophets, and the revelation\nof God\u2019s true religion, have defined one rank of angels, or intelligent\nbeings, fuperior to all the foregging, which anfwer to or are contained in\nthe ten diftinguifhing names of God, and are the pure ellences of his\nfpirit, or ftream though which his will and plealure is communicated\nto the angels and blcfled lpirits, and through which his providence extern s\nto the care and protection of all his works. The firft of iIk Ic divine of\u00ad\nfences is denominated HVP, Jehovah, and is peculiarly attributed to G jd\nthe Father, being the pure and fimple elTence ot the Divinity, flowi ig\nthough Hajoth Hakados, to the angel Metraiton, and to the minifteiing\nfpirit Re chith Hagalalim, who guides the primum mobile, and bellows\nthe gift of being upon all things. T o this fpirit is .allotted the office of\nNo. 4. Q bring-\n\f8o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nbringing the fouls of the faithful departed into heaven ; and by him God\nipake to Mofes. The fecond is FT J a b , and is attributed the Perfoa\nof the Mefliah, or whofe power and influence defeends though the\nangel Mafleh into the lphere of the Zodiac. This is the fpirit or word\nwhich actuated the chaos, and divided the unwrought matter into three\nportions; of thefirft, or moil eiTential part, was the fpiritual world com-\npofed ; of the fecond, was made the viiible heavens and the luminous\nbodies j and of the third, or inferior part, was formed the terreftrial\n\\*orld, oat of which was drawn the elemental quinteflence, orfirll matter\n-of all things, which produced the four elements, and all creaturcs*that\ninhabit them, by the agency of a particular fpirit called Raziel, who was\nthe ruler of Adam. The third is JTriK, E bjeh, and is attributed to the\nHoly Spirit, whofe divine light is received by the angel Sabbathi, and\ncommunicated from him though the fpherc o f Saturn. This is the prm -\nciphim gencrationu, the beginning of the ways of God, or the manifeila-\ntion of the Father and the Son's light in the fupernatural generation.\nAnd from hence flow dou n all living fouls, entering the inanimate body,\nand giving form to unfettled matter. The fourth is E \/, through the\nlight of whom flows grace, goodnefs, mercy, piety, and munificence,\nto the angel Zadkiel ; and, thcncc paffing through the fphere of Jupiter,\niarihioneth the images of all bodies, bellowing clemency, benevolence,\nand jnflicc, on all. The fifth is Elobi, the upholder of the fword\nand left-hand of God, whofe influence penetrates the angel Geburah, and\nthence defeends though the fphere of Mars, giving fortitude in war and\naffliction. 1 he fixth is rOK3 \u00a5, Tfebaothy who beftoweth his mighty\npower through the angel Raphael into the fphere of the Sun, giving mo\u00ad\ntion, heat, and brightnefs, to it, and thence producing metals. T hefe-\nventh is Elion, who rules the angel Michael, and defeends though\nthe fphere o f Mercury, giving benignity, motion, and intelligence, with\nelegance and consonance of fpecch. The eighth is ^TTR, Adonaiy whofe\ninfluence is received by the angel Haniel, and communicated through the\nhere of Venus, giving zeal, fervency, and righteoufnefs of heart, and\nproducing vegetables. The ninth is V\nP\nt\u00a3\\ Sbaddai, whofe influence is con\u00ad\nveyed by cherubim to the angel Gabriel, and falls into the fphere of the\nMoon, caufing increase and decreafe of all things, governing the genii and\nprotectors of men. The tenth is Elohim, who extends his bene\u00ad\nficence to the angel Jefodoth, into the fphere of the earth, and difpenfeth\nknowledge, underftanding, and wifdom. The three firft of thefe ten\nnan cs, viz. mn\\ Jehovah, FT, Jah, and iTliN, Ehjeh, exprefs the\neiTence of God^ and arc proper names ; but the other feven are only ex-\npreflive of his attributes. The principal and only true name of the God\u00ad\nhead, according both to the Hebrews and Greeks, is riTtfT)HM\"TRID,\n'iBTC\nuy{*ritm>\n9 the name o ffo u r lettersy with which the Godhead, in moil\nlanguages, is obierved to be expreffed ; thus in Hebrew the Supreme\nBeing\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . g*\nBeing is called PfliT Jehovah; in the Greek, \u00a9\ng\n<\n)f; in Latin, D e u s ; in\nSpanifli, D ios i in Italian, Idio ; in French, D ie u ;> in th t ancient G aul-\niih, D ie x ; in ancient German, D ie t; in the Sclavonic, B u ck; in Arabic\nA lla ; in the Polifli, B u n g ; in the Pannonian, *ijlu ; in the Egyptian,\nT entt; in the Perfian, Sire ; and in tjie language of the ancient Magi,\nOrfu Thus God is conceived'to work by the ideas of his own mind,\nand thefe ideas difpenfe their feals, and communicate them to whatevet\nis formed or created.\n*\nIn the exterior circle of the celeftial heaven, in which are placed\nthe fixed ftarg, the Anim a M undi hath her particular forms, or feminal\nconceptions, anfwering to the ideas of the Divine M in d ; and this fitu-\nation approaching neareft to the empyrean heaven, the feat of God, re\u00ad\nceives the fpiritual powers and influences which immediately proceed\nfrom him. Hence they are diffufed through the fpheres of the planets\nantrheavenly bodies, and communicated to the inmoft centre of the earth,\nby means of the terreflrial elements. Thus have the wife and learned\n,men A o n g the Jews deduced the conftru&ion and harmony of the world\nand ihewn that God performs all his fecret^nd ftupendous works by the\nmedium of the celeftial bodies. He a\u00a3ts and governs immediately by\nhimfelf, but mediately by the heavenly bodies, which are the inftruments\no f his Providence, and the fecondary caufes, by which the earth and all\nftmilar fyftcms are regulated ; and thefe, perhaps, regulate one another,\nby a reciprocal influence and fympathy, communicated to them in the\nordination of nature. And hence comes the original or ground-work\nof all men\u2019s nativities, and all manner o f natural queftions and things,\nand the ftory of all that may happen or proceed out of natural caufes, to\nthe full end of time. T o demonftrata\u00bb this more fatisfadtorily, we fhall\nnow define the natural properties o f the celeftial world, with its particu\u00ad\nlar divifions, quantity, motion, and meafure, as laid down by the rules\no f Aftronomy; and this w ill lead us to the dodrine o f nativities?\nAN\n\f82 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nA N A ST R O N O M IC A L SU R V E Y of the C E L E S T IA L W O R L D j\n\u00ab\n*\nwith the Places, Order, and Motions, of tKe H e a v e n l y Bodies,\n*\nIT was formerly a fubjeft of difpute among Philofophers, whether the\nearth, or the Sun was the centre of theceleftial fyftem ; but the latter\nopinion has been generally received lince the time of Copernicus, who about\nthe year 1543 publiihed his fix books De Orbium Caeleftium Revolu-\ntionibus, wherein he proves the Sun to be very near the centre of gravity of\nthe whole fyftem, and in the common focus of every one of the planetary\norbits. Next the Sun, Mercury performs his revolution around him ;\nnext to Mercury is the orbit of Venus; and next to Venus, our earth,\nwith its attendant or fecondary the Moon, perform a joint courfe, and by\ntheir revolution meafure out the annual period. Next to the earth is\nMars, the firft of the fuperior planets: next to him is Jupiter j and, laft\nof all, Saturn. Thefe and the comets are the conftituent parts of the\nCopernican or folar fyftem, which is now received and approved as the\nonly true one, becaufe mod agreeable to the tenor of nature in all her ac\u00ad\ntions ; for, by the two motions of the earth all the phenomena of the\nheavens are refolved, which by other hypothefes are inexplicable, without\na great number of other motions contrary to philofophical reafoning. It\nis alfo more rational to fuppofe that the earth moves round the Sun, than\nthat the huge bodies of the planets, the ftupendous body of the Sun, and\nthe immenfe firmament of ftars, ftiould all move round the earth every\ntwenty-four hours. The harmony which runs through the folar fyftem\nwonderfully confirms this hypothefis, viz. that the motions of all the\nplanets, both primary and fecondary, are governed and regulated by one\nand the fame law, which is, that the fquares of the periodical times of\nthe primary planets are to each other as the cubes of their diftances from\nthe Sun^ and likewife the fquares of the periodical times of theieconda-\nries of any primary are to each other as the cubes of their diftances from\nthat primary. Now the Moon, which, in the Copernican fyftem, is a fe\u00ad\ncondary of the earth, in the other hypothefis is considered as a primary\none; and fo the rule cannot take place, becaufe the periodical time ftated\nas that of a primary one does not agree therewith. But this Angle conli-\nderation is fufficicnt to eftablifh the motion of the earth for ever; viz. if\nthe earth does not move round the Sun, the Sun muft move with the\nMoon round the earth. Now the diftancc of the Sun to that of the\nMoon being as io,oooto 46, andthe Moon\u2019s period being lefs than twen\u00ad\nty-eight days, the Sun\u2019s period would be found no lefs than two hundred\nand forty-two years ; whereas, in fadl, it is but one year. The Sun alfo\nbeing the fountain of light and heat, which it irradiates through all the\n1 fyftem\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . S3\nfyftem, it muft of courfe be placed in the centre, in order that the planets\nfl)ay at all times have it in an uniform and equable manner. For, if the\nearth be fuppofed in the centre, and the Sun and planefs revolve about it,\nthe planets would then, like the comets, be fcorched with heat when\nneareil the Sun, and frozen w ith r H in theiraphelia, or greateft diftance;\nwhich is not to be imagined. .But, if the Sun be fuppofed in the centre\no f the fyftem, we then have the rational hypothefis*of the planets being all\nmoved round the Sun, by the univerfal law or power o f gravity ariiing\nfrom his vail body, and every thing will anfwer to the laws of circular\nmotion and central forces ; but otherwife we are wholly in the dark, and\nknow not how to define thefe operations of nature. Fortunately, however,\nwe are able to give not only reafons, but dempnftrable proofs, that the Sun\ndoes poffefs the centre of the fyftem, and that the planets move about\nhim in the order above-mentioned. The firft is, that Mercury and Ve\u00ad\nnus are ever obferved to have two conjundlions with the Sun, but no op-\npofition, which could not happen unlefs the orbits of thefe planets lay\nwithin the orbit of the earth. The fecond is, that Mars, Jupiter, and\nSaturn, have each their conjundlions and oppofitions to the Sun alternately\nand fucceflively, which could not be, unlefs their orbits were exterior to\nthat of the earth. In the third place, the greateft elongation or diftance\nof Mercury from the Sun is about twenty degrees, and that of Venus\nforty-feven degrees; which anfwers exadlly to their diftance in this fyf\u00ad\ntem ; but, in the other, they would be feen one\u00abhundred and eighty de\u00ad\ngrees from the Sun, in oppofition to him. Fourthly, in this difpofition\no f the planets, they will all of them be fornetimes mu\u00a3h nearer to the earth\nthan at others ; the confequence of which is, that their brightnefs and\nfplendor, and alfo their apparent diameters, will be proportionally great\u00ad\ner at one time than another; and this we obferve to be true every day.\nThus, the apparent diameter of Venus, when greateft, is near fixty-fix\nfeconds, but, when lead, not more than nine and a half ; of Mars, when\ngreateft, it is twenty-one leconds, but, when lead, no more than two fe\u00ad\nconds and a h alf; whereas, by the other hypothefis, they ought always\nto be equal. The fifth is, that, when the planets are viewed with a good\ntelefcope, they appeal with different phafes, or with different parts of\ntheir bodies enlightened. Thus Venus is fornetimes new, then horned,\nand afterwards dichotomized, then gibbous, afterwards full, and fo cn-\ncreafes and decreafes her light in the fame manner as the Moon, and as\nthis fyftem requires. The fixth proof is, that the planets, all of them,\ndo fornetimes appear diredt in motion, fornetimes retrograde, and at other\ntimes ftationary. Thus Venus, as fhe paffes from her greateft elongation\nweftward to her greateft elongation eaftward, will appear diredt in mo\u00ad\ntion, but retrograde as fhe paffes from the latter to the former; and,\nwhen (he is in thofe points of greateft diftance from the Sun, fhe feems\nNo. 4. . R \u2022 f a\n* *\n\f84 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nfor fome time ftationary ; all which is neceflary upon the Copernicnn hy-\npothefis, but cannot happen in any other. The feventh is, that the bo\u00ad\ndies of Mercury and Venus, in their lower conjundions with the Sun,\nare hid behind the Sun\u2019s body, and in the upper conjundions are feen to\npafs over the Sun\u2019s body, or diik, in form of a black round fpot, which is\nneceflary in the Copernican fyftcm, but impoflible in any other. The\neighth is, that the times in which thefe conjundions, oppofitions, fta-\ntions, and r\u00e9trogradations, of the planets happen, are not fuch as they\nwould be if the earth were at reft in its orbit, but precifely fuch as\nwould happen were the earth to move round the Sun, and all the other\nplanets in the periods afligned them ; and therefore this, and no other,\ncan be the true fyftem of the world.\nBut, the better to determine the places of the celeftial bodies, and to\nunderftand the conftituticn of the heavens more clearly, aftronomers have\nconceived or deferibed feveral circles, called the circles of the fphere, by\nwhich the celeftial world is divided and meafured out. Some of thefe\nare called great circles, as the equinodial, ecliptic, meridian, &c. and\nothers fmall circles, as the tropics, parallels, & c. The equinodtial line\nis a circle which we imagine to invert the whole world, and is fo called,\nbecaufe, whenever the Sun, in his progrefs through the ecliptic, comes to\nthis circle, it makes equal days and nights all round the globe, as he\nthen rifes due eaft, and fets due weft, which he never does at any other\ntime of the year. This equinodfial line is conceived to be three hundred\nand fixty degrees in its whole circumference ; and each of thefe degrees\nare divided into fixty minutes, or lixty equal parts of a degree, and thefe\nagain into as many f\u00e9conds. The meridian is another great circle, con\u00ad\nfiding alfo of three hundred and fixty degrees, extending from one polar\npoint to the other, and twice cutting theequinoftial line, compafling the\nwhole world from north to fouth, as the equinoftial does from eaft to\nweft, and terminates at the fame point where it began. The equinodlial\nline is fixed and immutable, and is of neceflity always conceived to be\nin one and the fame place; but the meridian is mutable, and may circle\nthe world in any or in all degrees of the equator, as we may have occafion\nto conceive or imagine ; it muft however, uniformly divide the fphere\ninto two equal parts, which are called hemifpheres. The polar points\nare tbofe two points in the immenfe ball of the world which are cqui-\ndiftant from the equino\u00e9tial line, the one in the utmoft northern, and the\nother in the utmoft fouthern, point. The three hundred and fixty degrees\nof the equinodtial line are called the longitude of the world, becaufe they\nare in order as the Sun and ftars move in their circuits through the fpaci-\nous heavens in their refpedtive orbs. But the three hundred and fixty de\u00ad\ngrees of the meridian are called the latitude of the world, becaufe they\ni mete\n\fOF A S T R O L O G Y . 85\nmctc out that diftance wherein the Sun and all the ftars, in a certain\nbreadth one from another, move in their circuits from eaft to weft.\nNow the Sun, in his annual progrefs from weft to eaft, does not keep\nthe equinoftial line, but declines from it at one part of the year to the\nnorth, and at another part of the year to the fouth; and the planets alfo\nobferve the fame order in their progrefs, except that the Sun always keeps\nthe fame conftant track, whereas the planets often vary in their declina\u00ad\ntions from the equinoctial line. Hence another great circle is conceived\nin the heavens, called the Zodiac, which is likewife divided, as all the\ngreat circles are, into three hundred and fixty degrees; but this circle\nbeing as it were the high road of the planets, and comprehending fo much\nof the heavens as the Sun and planets fwerve in their declinations, is con\u00ad\nceived to be twenty degrees broad ; and it is confined to this fpace, be-\ncaufe none of the planets ever reach beyond ten degrees north, or ten de\u00ad\ngrees fouth, from the equinodtial line; and the Sun\u2019s path or track in the\nZodiac is called the ecliptic line, becaufe the eclipfes only happen w hen,\nthe Moon is alfo in this line. ,\nThe Zodiac is alfo divided into twelve equal parts, called the twelve\nSigns, or houfes o f heavon ; and, thefe beginning where the Sun enters the\nequinoctial to the northward, the firft fign is named Aries, and the reft\nin order arc called Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio,\nSagittarius, Capricornus, Aquaries, and Pifces. Theie figns confift of\nthirty degrees each ; and, being all of them divided into four equal parts,\ndetermine the four feafons of the year. Now, when the Sun enters into\nthe fign called Cancer, he is in his greateft north declination, and at that\ntime is diftant from the equinoctial line twenty-three degrees to the\nnorth; which occaiions another circle to be deferibed, called the tropic\nof Cancer, the center of which being the north pole, it comprehends\nas much of the extremity of the round world as falls under twenty-\nthree degrees and a half from the equator to the northward. And, when\nthe Sun enters the fign Capricornus, he is in his utmoft fouth decli\u00ad\nnation, and occaiions another circle to be deferibed, called the tropic\nof Capricorn, as many degrees from the equator to the fouth as the\nother tropic is to the north. A t the diftance of forty-five degrees from\neach of thefe tropics two other circles are imagined, called the arftic\nand antarflic circles, which, being but little more than twenty degrees\ndiftant from each pole, do likewife encircle fome fmall portion of the\nextremities of the world. The inferior circles, called parallels, run\nfrom eaft to weft, and ferve to divide the heavens into feveral fpaces be\u00ad\ntween the greater circles.\nAncient\n\f86 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nAncient tradition has handed down to us the origin of that important\ncircle called the Zodiac, with the realon .why \\t \u00a1s fb named, and the inge\u00ad\nnious method which the firft ir^n made ufe of to know exactly the line\nwhich the Sun dcicribcs under the heavens jn the perpetual changings of\nits place, and to divide the year into equaj portions. This tradition is\nfound in two ancient authors, the one J^oman, the other Greek. The\nfirft attributes it to the Egyptians \u2022 the other, to the firft inhabitants of\nChaldea. They every day law the Sun and th.e whole heayens turning\nand puffing from eaft to weft. In the mean time they obferved that the\nSun, by a motion peculiar to it, from day to day receded from fome cer\u00ad\ntain ftars, and took its place under others, always advancing towards the\neaft. Whilft the Moon was making twelve times that revolution, the\nSun made it only once; but flic began the thirteenth again, before the\nSun had as yet compleated it^ own. The habit of dividing the year into\npretty near twelve lunations, made them wifh that they had twelve divi-\nfions of a year perfedtly equal, or twelve months, which might be exadtly\nequivalent to the year itfelf, and which mighr, as it were, be pointed at\nwith one\u2019s finger in the heavens, by (hewing fome certain ftars under which\nthe Sun pafles during every one of thefe months. Here is then the me\u00ad\nthod in which they divided the courfe of the Sun in twelve equal portions\nor collections of ftars, which are called aftcrifms or conftellatiuns. Our\naftronomers took a couple of brafs open veflels, the one pierced at the\nbottom, and the other without any orifice below. Having flopped the\nhole of the firft, they filled it with water, and placed it fo as that the wa\u00ad\nter might run out into the other vcflel, the moment the cock fhould be\nopened. This done, they obferved in that part of the heaven, where the\nSun has its annual courfe, the rifing of a ftar, remarkable either for its\nmagnitude or brightnefs; and, at the critical inftant it appeared on the\nhorizon, they began to let the water flow out of the upper vcflel into the\nother during the reft of the night, and the whole following day, to the\nvery moment when the fame ftar, being come to the eaft again, began to\nappear anew on the horizon. The inftant it was again feen, they took\naway the under veflel, and threw the water that remained- in the other\non the ground. The obfervers were thus fure of having one revolution\nof the whole heaven, between the firft rifing of the\" ftarj ^nd its return.\nThe water, which had flowed during that time, might then afford them\na means of meafuring the duration of one whole revolution of the heaven,\nand of dividing that duration into feveral equal portions; fince, by dividing\nthat water itfelf into twelve equal parts, they were fure of having the re\u00ad\nvolution of a twelfth part of the heaven during the efflux of a twelfth\npart of the water; they then divided the water of the under veflel into\ntwelve parts perfectly equal, and prepared two other fmall veflels capable\nof containing exactly one o f thofe portions, and no more. They again\npoured\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 87\npoured into the great upper veflel the twelve parts of water all at once,\nkeeping the veflels ihut. Then they placed under the cock, ftill ihut,\none of the two fmall veiTels, and another near it to fuccced the firft as\nfoon as it ihould be full.\nAll thefe preparations being ready, they, the next night, obferved that\npart of the heaven towards which they had for a long while remarked that\nthe Sun, the Moon, and the planets, took their courfes, and ftaid for the\nrifingof the conftellation which is fince called Aries. The Greeks, per\u00ad\nhaps, gave that name to fome ftars different from thofe which went by it\nbefore the flood; but this enquiry is not neceflary at prefent. The in\u00ad\nflam Aries appeared, and they faw the firil ftar of it afeending, they let\nthe water run into the little meafure. As foon as it was full, they re\u00ad\nmoved it, and threw the water out. In the mean time they put the other\nempty meafure under the fall. They obferved exadlly, and fo as to re\u00ad\nmember very well, all the ftars that rofe during all the periods which the\nmeafure took in filling ; and that part of the heaven was terminated in\ntheir obfervations by the ftar which appeared the laft on the horizon, the\nmoment the meafure was juft fu ll: fo that, by giving the two little veflfcls\nthe time neceflary to be alternately failed to the brim three times each\nduring the night, they had, by that means, one half of the courfe o f the\nfun in the heaven, that is, one half of the heaven itfclf; and that half\nagain was divided into fix equal portions, of which they might fhew and\ndiftinguiih the beginning, the middle, and the end, by ftars, which, from\ntheir fize, number, or order, were rendered diftinguifhable. As to the\nother half of the heaven, and the fix other conftellations which the fun\nruns over therein, they were forced to defer the obfervation of them to\nanother feafon. They waited till the fun, being placed in the middle o f\nthe now known and obferved conftellations, ihould leave them at liberty\nto fee the other during the night. *\nDoubtlefs, fome precautions were neceflary, not to miftake as to the\nfall of the water, which mail flow more flowly in proportion as its mafs\nis lefs high. However, after having, by this or fome fuch means, made\nthemfelves fure of the great annual courfe which the fun faithfully fol\u00ad\nlows in the heavens, and of the equality of the fpaces filled by the twelve\ncolletftions of ftars that limit that courle, the obfervers thought of giving\nthem names. They in general called them the ftations or the houfes of\nthe fun, and afligned three of them to each feafon. They then gave\neach conftellation a peculiar name, whofe property did not only confift\nin making it known again to all nations, but in declaring, at the fame\ntime, the circumftance of the year (which was of concern to mankind)\nwhen the fun ihould arrive at that conftellation\u00ab\nNo. 4. S By\n\f88 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nBy a particular care of Providence, the dams of the flock commonly\nhappen to be pregnant about the end of autumn; they bring forth\nduring the winter and in the beginning of the fpring; whence it\nhappens that the young ones are kept warm under the mother during\nthe cold, and afterwards eafily thrive and grow acftive at the return of\nthe heat. The Iambs corne the firft, the calves follow them, and the\nkids fall the laft. By this means the lambs, grown vigorous and ftrong,\nmay follow the ram to the fields, as the fine days com e on. Soon after\nthe calves, and at laft the kids, venture abroad, and, by increasing the\nflock, begin to augment the revenues o f their mafter.\nOur ancient obfervers, feeing that there were, during the fpring, no\nproduftions more ufcful than lambs, calves, and kids, gave the coiifte]-\nlations, under which the fun pafies during that feafon, the names of\nthe three animals which enrich mankind moft. The firft was named\nAries, the fecond Taurus, the third the two kids, Gemini, the better\nto charailerize the fecundity of goats, which more commonly bring\nforth two young ones than one, and an abundance of milk more than\niufficknt to nourifh them.\nThe bulk of mankind had already very often remarked, that there was\na point to which the fun raifed itlelf in its coming towards them, but\nwhich it never exceeded ; and that it afterwards funk daily, in receding\nfrom them, for fix months together, till it arrived at another point a great\nway under the firft, but below which it never defeended. This retreat\nof the fun, made very flowly, and always backward, gave the obfervers\nthe occaiion of diftinguiihing the ftars, which follow the two kids, or\nGemini, by the name of the animal that walks backward, viz. the crab.\nWhen the fun pafies under the next conftellation, it makes our climate\n4 eel fultry heats, but chiefly the climates where men were at that time\nall gathered together. When poets attribute to that conftellation the\nfiercenefs and raging of the lion, of which it bears the name, it is very\nealy to guefs at what might determine that choice from the beginning.\nSoon after, the houfing of the hay and the corn is entirely over through *\nout the eail; there remain on the ground only a few ears fcattered here\nand there, which they caufed to be gleaned by the leaft neceiTary hands ;\nthis work is left to the youngeft girls. How then could they reprefent\nthe conftellation, under which the fun fees no longer any crops on the\nground, better than by the name and figure of a young maid gleaning $\nThe wings you fee her have in the fpheres are ornaments added o f later\ndate, alter the introdu&ion of fables. The virgin, which follows the\nLion, is certainly no other than a gleaning girl, or, if you w ill, a reaper;\nand, left we ihould miftake her fun&ions, ihe befideshas in her hand acluf-\nter of ears; a very natural proof of the origin here attributed to her.\ni The\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y # 89\nThe perfeft equality of days and nights* which happens when the Sun\nquits the fign Virgo, caufedaftronomers to give the next lign the name of\nLibra, that is, o f a balance\u00ab The frequent difeaies which the Sun leaves\nbehind him, orcaufes by his retiring, procured the next iign the name of\nScorpio; becaufe it is mifehievous, and drags after it a fling and venom.\nTowards the end o f autumn, the fall of the leaf expofes wild beafts, leav\u00ad\ning them lefs covering : vintage and harveft are over; the fields are free ;\nand it is of ill confequence to fuffer the propagation of beafts at the ap\u00ad\nproach o f winter. Every thing then invites us to hunt, and the fign, in\nwhich the Sun is at that time* has from thence obtained the name of\nSagittarius; that is, the archer, or huntfman. What is the proper and\ndiftin&ive charadter of the wild goat, or Capricorn, of which the firft\nfign of winter has the name ? it is to look for its food, getting from the\nfoot of the mountains to the higheft fummit, and always climbing from\nrock to rock: the name of Capricorn was then fit to inform men of\nthe time when the Sun, having reached the loweft verge of its courfe, was\nready to begin to afeend again towards the higheft, and to continue to do\nfo for fix months together. This is quite the reverfe of the crab (Cancer);\nand the happy concurrence of the oppoiite characters o f thefe two ani\u00ad\nmals is a proof of what directed the firft obfervers in the impofition of\nall thefe names. Aquaries and Pifces, without any difficulty, mark out\nthe rainy feafon, and the time of the year when fifties, fatter and nicer than\nin any other time, bring on again the profit and pleafure of fiihing. It\nmay be remarked, that, of the twelve conftellations, there are ten, the\nnames of which are borrowed from feveral animals; which caufed aftro-\nnomers to give the annual circle, which they compofe, the name of Z o\u00ad\ndiac. It is as much as if you would fay, the circle o f animals.\nBy this very plain induftry, men acquired a new method of meafuring\ntime, and of regulating all their works. They already knew, without\nany trouble or care, how to regulate the order of their feafts and common\nbufinefs, by infpection only of the phafes of the Moon. From the know\u00ad\nledge of the Zodiac, they obtained an exact knowledge of the year : the\nconftellations became to them fo many very fignificant figns, which*\nboth by their names and refpective fituations, informed them of the or\u00ad\nder of their harveils, and of the cautions they were to take, in order to\nbring them about, openly and daily ihewing them how long they were to\nflay for them ; the people were neither obliged to caft up the days, nor\nmark out the order of times, to regulate themfelves. Twelve words, ap\u00ad\nplied to twelve different parts of the heaven, which every night revolved\nbefore their eyes, were to them a part of knowledge no lefs convenient\nand advantageous than eafy to be acquired. When men, after the fetting\nof the Sun, faw the ftars of the fign Aries afeend the oppofite horizon,\nand dillant from the Sun by one half of the heaven, they then knew that\n\f9o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe fun was under the fign Libra, which, being the feventh of the celef-\ntul figns, was diftant from the firft by one whole half of the Zodiac.\u2014\nWhen at the approach of day they faw in the middle of the heaven, and\nat an equal diftance from eaft and weft, the fineft ftar of the lign Leo, they\neafily underftoed that the fun, then ready to rife, was at the diftance of\nthree figns from Leo, and removed towards the eaft one quarter part of its\ncircle. Thus, without feeing the ftars which the fun drowned by its\nbrightnefs as he came under them, they faid, with a perfedt affurance, that\nthe fun is now in Scorpio ; two months hence* we (hall have the ihorteft\nday. They could, on fight of a fingle conftellation, placed in the eaftern,\nor middle, or weftern, part of the heaven, immediately fay where the fun\nwas, how far the year was advanced, and what kind of work it was fit\nthey ihould bufy themfelves about. After this manner fhepherds and\nfarmers ftill regulate their works; and, if we at prefent are now ignorant\nof the ftars, if we are not able to determine the diftance between one\nconftellation ihewn us and the adtual place of the fun, it is becaufe we\ncan read and write. The firft men perufed the heavens for want of writ\u00ad\ning ; and it is on account of the conveniency of writing that the gene\u00ad\nrality of men now difpenfe with looking among the ftars for the know\u00ad\nledge of the operations and order of the year. But writing itfclf, that\nfo ufeful invention, is one of the produces of aftronomy; and it may be\neafily (hewn alfo, that the names given the twelve celeftial figns gave\nbirth to the invention both of painting and writing. The hiftory of the\nheavens ftill promifes further novelty, and it will continue to inform us\nof the helps for which we are indebted to the ftudy of nature.\nNow, merely to know and to underftand thefe divifions of the heavens\nis nothing more than fpeculative aftrology, commonly called Aftronomy ;\nbut, to attain to the knowledge of Aftrology in general, we muft be con-\nverfant in the affe\u00a3lions and qualities of the heavenly matter, and of the pla\u00ad\nnets and fixed ftars. It is generally imagined that the fixed ftars are \/ali\u00ad\nened in the eighth orb of the celeftial heaven, and only move as that orb\ndoth, and uniformly together, about one minute\u2019s fpace in a wholeyear;\nbut reafon has not abfolutely determined this point, fo as to leave it quite\nfatisfaftory, or incontrovertible. The fixed ftars are obferved to differ\nfrom the planets by their twinkling or fparkling; whence philofophers\nhave conceived them to fhine with their own innate light, the fame as the\nfun does. The number of ftars difcoverable in either hcmifphere is\nnot above a thoufand. This at firft may appear incredible, becaufe they\nfeemto be without number; but the deception arifes from our looking\nconfufedly upon them, without reducing them into any order*. If we\nbut look ftedfaltly upon a pretty large portion of the iky, and count the\n* See Fergufon\u2019s Aftronomy, Soft. 355, &c.\nftars\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 91\nftars in it, wefhall be furprifed to find them fo few ; and, if we conii-\nder how feldom the moon meets with any ftars in her way, although\nthere are as many about her path as in other parts of the heavens, we\nmay foon be convinced that the ftars are much thinner fown than peo\u00ad\nple are aware of. The Britifh catalogue, which, befides the ftars vifible\nto the naked eye, includes a great number which cannot be feen without\nthe affiftance of a telefcope, contains no more than three thoufand in both\nhemifpheres. From what we know of the immenfe diftances of the fixed\nftars, the neareft may be computed at 32,000,000,000,000 o f miles from\nthe earth, which is farther than a cannon-ball would fly in feven mil\u00ad\nlion of years! Thefe ftars, on account of their apparently various mag\u00ad\nnitudes, are diftributed intofeveral clafles or orders; thofe which appear\nlargcft are called ftars o f thefirft magnitude \\ the next to them, in fize\nand luftre, ftars o f the fecond magnitude; and fo on to the ftxth , which\nconfift of the fmalleft that can be feen by the naked eye. This diftri-\nbution having been made long before the invention of telefcopes, the\nftars which cannot be feen without the help of thefe inftruments are\ndiftinguiflied by the name oi telefcopic ftars.\nFor the fame reafon that the ftars within the belt or circle of the zo\u00ad\ndiac were divided into conftellations, fo have been thofe on either fide\nof i t ; viz. to diftinguifh them from one another, fo that any particular\nftar may be readily found in the heavens, by the help of a celeftial globe,\nupon which the conftellations are fo delineated as to put the moft re\u00ad\nmarkable ftars into fuch parts of the figures which repiefent them as\nare moft eafily diftinguifhed ; and thofe ftars which could not be brought\ninto any part of thefe figures are called unformedftars. The number of\nthe ancient conftellations is forty-eight : viz. upon the zodiac twelve;\nupon all that region of the heavens on the north-fide of the zodiac,\ntwenty-one ; and upon the fouth-iide fifteen more ; making in the\nwhole forty-eight conftellations. But, the more modern philolophers\nand aftrologians having added a number of others, I ihall let the whole\ndown in their proper order.\nT A B L E of the Ancient C O N S T E L L A T I O N S.\nPtolemy.

The nearer they aie fituated to the ecliptic line, and\nthe zodiac, fo much the apter are they to operate in the common adts\nof nature; and fo much the more eaiily allured into the opportunities\nof our acquaintance. O f the firft magnitude we have extraordinary in-\nftances of that ilar in Leo, called Cor Leonist in twenty-five degrees of the\niign, to be of the nature of Mars and Jupiter mixed together ; and is a\nftar greatly contributing to noble qualifications, and kingly favour. Fa\u00ad\nmous alio is the knowledge of Spica Virginisf a ilar of Virgo by concilia\u00ad\ntion, but in thefign Libra : this ftar partakes both of the nature of Venus\nand Mars, and contributes greally to ecclefiaftical preferments. After\nthefe are very well knoyn the ilars called Aldebaron in Gemini, and\nA n tares\n\f9 4\nA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nHvJarcf in Sagittarv, both ftars of the nature of Mars, provoking to\ncourage and magnanimity, but inclining to violence and cruelty. O f\nthe feeor.J magnitude are the South Balance, and the Head of' Pollux,\nboth liars of a furious and violent nature. O f the third magnitude,\nthe Head c f Hed'ifdy or s ihoi, is famous for its mifehievous inclinations ;\nand io are the two A jf'es, liars of the fourth magnitude. O f the fifth\nmagnitude are the Pleiades, ftars of remaikable influence, and celebrated\nfor their fweet and benevolent rature. Stars of the fixth magnitude\nare very fmall ; y^t, notwithftanding this, they are not without their\noperations upon earthly things ; as in the breail of the Crab, called\nPr&Jepe, are leveral little liars which appear only like a white cloud,\nand yet the force of this ccnflellation has been often felt in the affairs\nof mankind. Thefefived liars alfo often prove their force in the change\nof weather, as they happen to rife, culminate, or fet, with the fun,\nmoon, and planets.\nBut the conilellations which form the twelve figns of the zodiac have\nobvioufly the moil powerful and moil immediate operation upon n u n ;\nand the reafon is, becaufe they form the pathway of the fun, moon, and\nplanets, in all their peregrinations, and thereby receive from them a\nmore forcible power and energy. And, as thefe figns form a confiderable\npart of the Science of Aftrology, we Hull confider them under all their\nvarious qualities and affections, both with refpect to their operations upon\nnun\u2019s body and upon the four feafons of the year. Thefe figns are\nknown or diilinguifhed by the following characters ;\nor Aries\n\u00bb Taurus\nn Gemini\nCancer Libra\nLeo T\ntt Scorpio\nVirgo x Sagittarius\nvf Capricornus\n~ Aquaries\nX Pilces\nTh ey are placed in this order, and divided into four equal parts, an-\nfwering to the four quarters of the year, becaufe the equator cuts and\ndivider the circle of the zodiac at the point beginning with Aries, and at\nthe oppofite point of Libra, dividing the whole into twp equal parts,\nconfilLng of fix northern and fix fouthern figns. But the reafon why\nthe fun\u2019s courfe begins and is reckoned from Aries is, as tradition in\u00ad\nforms us, becaufe the fun, when firil brought into exiftence, was\nplaced in this fign. And this is not an unreafonable conjeture, fince\nthe fpiing quarter begins when the Sun enters Aries, and brings with\nit m\u00e9rcate <m\nd length of days, and all nature begins to multiply and\nfl c: lL, und, as it were, to rile into new life. The fix northern figns\nu n .none with Virgo, and the fix fouthern commence with Libra; but\nthe northern figns have always been confidered of a more efficacious and\n;nature than the fouthern. .\nPhilofophers\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 95\nPhilofophers have alfo affigned another reafon for this order and di-\nvifion of the twelve figns of the zodiac, namely, That Nature works by\noppofition and contrariety, and thus brings about the four ftates of all\nelementary bodies, viz. generation, confervation, corruption, and anni\u00ad\nhilation. As therefore generation is the firft Hate, and is produced and\nnouriihed by heat, they begin with the fiery fign Aries. The next\nquality being confervation; or durability, they fignify the fame by\nplacing an earthy fign next in order, fince earth gives permanency and\nfixation to corruptible bodies. The third quality being corruptible,\nit is reprefented by an airy fign, becaufe air is known to be the fource\no f putrefa&ion. T he laft Hate of an elementary body is its final end,\nor diilolution; and, as water difiblves all corruptible bodies, fo have\nthey defcribed it by placing a watery fign the laft of all. In this ar\u00ad\nrangement o f the figns of the zodiac we may further obferve, that two\npafiive principles are placed between two adtive ones ; and, as our all\u00ad\nwife \u00abCreator hath fo conftructed nature, that the oppofition of one\nthing ihould occafion the exiftcnce or duration of another, fo we may\nobferve it in the divifions of the zodiac ; for inftance, Aries, a fiery fign,\nis placed oppofite to Libra, which is an airy fign; and in all refpects\nrefembles a man fitting before a fire with a pair of bellows in his hands,\nblowing to keep it burning : for, without air, fire is foon extinguiihed.\nIn the fame manner it is with the water and the earth; but, to make\nthefe obfervations more apparent, we will arrange the figns of the zodiac\nunder all their different qualities and forms.\nThe Divifions of the Twelve S I G N S of the Z O D I A C .\nSigns oppofite are the f <\nv\n* a n as si \u2022\u00bb Northern and commanding,\nfirft fix to the laft fix\\ a m \/ w ss x Southern and obeying. .\nThey are divided alfo according\nto their four Triplicities and\nNature\nFiery v Si # H ot and d ry.'\nEarthy a m\nt & Cold and dry.\nn * x Hot and moift.\no H H Cold and moift.\nAiry\nLWatery\nSome are Mafculine, as r n si t Fiery and airy, mafeuline.\nSome are Feminine, as a o \u00ab1 v x Earthy and watery, feminine.\nEquinoctial A\nTropical C\nB k\nf\nFixed 8 a m 9\n+\nm\nCommon n m t K\nMoveable 8\n3 A f\ne\ne\nNo. 5.

In\nthe weft n m and Yt are cold and moift, 8 cold, t hot and dry.\nThefe qualities are abfolutely neceflary to be obferved in judging of the\nweather.\nWhen the moon, or lord of the afcendant, is pofited, at a nativity,\nin any of the figns wc term hot, the native will be manly and vigorous,\nand\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 97\nand choler will abound in him ; but, if any of thofe figns we term cold,\nhe will then be meek, womaniih, and effeminate ; all which affeftions\nproceed from phlegm.\nThere are figns called quadrupedian, or four-footed, as T \u00ab Si t\nbecaufe thofe creatures from whence they are named have four feet ;\nand in a nativity, where either of them afcend, they import that the con-;\nftitution of the native partakes much of the nature of that creature they\nreprefent ; for inftancc, if Aries afeends, then he will be hot and dry, and\npartake of the qualities of the ram ; if Taurus be lord of the afeendant,\nhe will be furious, as the bull ; if Leo afcend, he will be in nature bold\nand magnanimous; if Sagittarius, he will be perfevering and intrepid;\nif Capricorn, he will be luftful and libidinous, like the goat. So there\nare figns of humanity, as n m - , and the firft part of \/ ; and in\nnativities where any of thefe figns afcend, or in which the lord of the\nafeendant is placed, itfignines that the native is of a friendly difpofition.\nhumane, affable, and courteous ; of an excellent carriage, and engaging\nbehaviour. Again, fome figns are called fruitful, as as nt >\n\u00a3 \u2022 and, it\nthe afeendant or his lord, or the moon, be placed in any one of thefe, or\nif the cufp of the fifth houfe has one of thefe upon it, or if his lord be\npofited in one of them, the native will have many children, or will be\nof a prolific conftitution ; but, if barren figns pollefs the aforefaid places,\nthen, according to the plain courie ot nature, fterility and barrennefs\nwill follow. There are alfo fome figns termed mule, as ss tri x . If\nany of thefe afcend in a nativity, and Mercury, who is the general fig-\nnificator of fpeech, be afflicted by the planet Saturn and the Dragon\u2019s\nTail in an evil houfe of heaven, and the afeendant alfo vitiated, the na\u00ad\ntive will be born dumb ; if Mercury be free, and the afeendant only\nafflifted, or if the afeendant be free, and Mercury afflicted, the native\nwill be generally filent, and flow of fpeech. But, if figns of voice afcend\nin a nativity, as u m A \u00bb t the native will poilefs a volubility of\nfpeech, and be a good orator. Again, fome figns arc feial, i. e. brutifh,\nor favage ; fuch are si and the lafl put of Sagittarius. Some are\ntermed hoarfe, or whittling, as T \u00ab a ^ ; and whcnev\u00a3r_Leq, or the\nlaft part of Sagittarius, attend ia a nativity, the native will be brutiflily\ninclined, and polfefs an unfeeling and cruel difpofition. Thofe perfons,\nin whofe nativity V b Si kf are horofcopical, have a conflint hoarfe-\nnefs or whittling in their delivery and fpeech, though otherwife .quick\nand voluble enough ; and thofe perfons are geaerally crooked, deformed,\nor imperfedtly born, who have \u00ab attending,, and Caput Algol pofited\nin the attendant. *\nThere are alfo degrees which are termed mafeuline, feminine, light,\ndark, fmoky, pitted, azimene or deficient, and increafing fortune ;\nthefe are all exhibited at one view in the following table.\n.

Jo, under the column of\nmafculine degrees ; and under the column of feminine, you have 9. 22,\nwhich (hews that the firil eight degrees of T are mafculine, and the\nninth degree feminine; from 9 to 15 are mafculine, and from 15 to 22\nieminine ; and from 22 to 30 are mafculine. The ufe of which is, that, if\nthe principal fignificator in a nativity be pofited in the degrees and figns\nmafculine, be the native male or female, it argues, that he or ihe ihall\ninherit a more maiculine temper and refolution than ordinary. But, if\nthe fignificator be in feminine figns and degrees, then the native will be\nmore effeminate, timid, and lefs robuft. The fame obfervation holds\ngood with refpect to the other figns and degrees, as in the table they\nHand directed. The fourth column points out that there are certain de\u00ad\ngrees in each iign, which are termed light j and, if either of thefe afeend\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 99\nin a nativity, the native will be of a fairer and clearer complexion than\nordinary. The fifth column {hews that there are decrees termed dark or\nobfeure; and, whenever thefe happen to be horofeopica! in a nativity, they\ndeclare the native to be of a dark or fallow complexion, and, if he Ihould\nbe born deformed, his deformity will be confidefably greater. The fixth\n.column ihews which degrees of the zodiac are called fmoky ; and, if any\nof them arife on the eaftern fineter at the time of birth, they declare the\nnative of a mixed complexion, neither fair nor fwarthy, but partaking of\nboth ; and fimilar to his complexion will be his underftanding. The\nfeventh column ihews which of the degrees of the zodiac are called void;\nand, if the afeendant in the radix of any nativity be pofited in them; it\ndelares an imbecility in the judgment and underftanding of the native;\nand, the farther he enters into converfation or bufinefs, the more obvious\nwill this defect appear. The eighth column points out what degrees in\neach of the twelve figns^arecalled deep and p i t t e d and thefe, in a nativity,\nfignify, that if the afeendant, his'lord, or the moon, be fituated in any of\nthem, the native will be of a hafty and imperfect fpeech, incapable of ex\u00ad\nprefling his defires, or of declaring his fentiments; and will be always in-\nvolved'in vexatious litigations and difputes ; and, like a man in a p it or\nfnare, will want the afliffance of another to help him out. H ie ninth\ncolumn diftinguiflies the azimcnc> lame, or deficient^ degrees; and, if in a\nnativity any one of thefe afetnd, or the lord of the afeendant, or the moon,\nbe in any of them, the native will be crooked, lame, or deformed, or in\nfome manner vitiated in the member or part o f' t1fe1 $&dy That the fign\ngoverns in which fuch azimene degiees {lull happen to be. This rule\nis lb unexceptionable and invariable, that it ought to be well coniidered\nin the judgment of every nativity. The tenth column points out all the\ndegrees in the twelve figns that are augmentors or increalers of fortune;\nand the knowledge to be derived from them is, that if, in a nativity, the\ncufp of the fccond houfe, or lord of the fecond, Jupiter^ or part of for\u00ad\ntune,' be in degrees augmenting, they theft become arguments of much\nwealth; and prefage that the native {hall, according to hit capacity or\nfituation in life, attain to ftill greater honour, riches, and pieferment.\nBut, befides thefe general properties, each of the figns poifeis a parti\u00ad\ncular efficacy and virtue peculiar to themfelves, or to that part of the hea\u00ad\nvens wherein they bear rule. For, as upon earth all giound will not\nbring forth the fame fruit, fo in the heavens all places or parts thereof\nwill not produce the fameefteits. Upon the earth, a man in his journey\nrides over ten miles, more or lefs, upon the fands; at another time, he\ntraces over as many miles more upon the clay ; and, after that, he pro\u00ad\nceeds on another ten miles upon the marl and gravel. Similar to this,\nby the moil corre\u00a3t obfervation, appears to be the alternate variations of\nNo. s, X the\n\f100 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe heavenly matter.

It travels in its orb at the rate of\neighteen thoufand miles every hour, and performs its annual revolution\nround the fun in twenty-nine years, one hundred and fixty-feven days,\nand five hours, of our time; which makes only one year to that planet.\nAnd, though it appears to us no larger than a ilar of the third magnitude,\nyet its diameter is found to be no lefs than fixty-feven thoufand Engliih\nmiles; and confequently near iix hundred times as big as the earth ! This\nplanet is furrounded by a thin broad ring, fomewhat refembling the ho\u00ad\nrizon of an artificial globe ; and it appears double when feen through a\ngood telefcopc. It is inclined thirty degrees to the ecliptic, and is about\ntwenty-one thoufand miles in breadth ; which is equal to its diilance\nfrom Saturn on all tides. There is reafon to believe that the ring turns\nround its axis, becaufe, when it is almoft edge-ways to us, it appears fome\u00ad\nwhat thicker on one tide of the planet than on the other ; and the thickeil\nedge has been feen on different fides at different times. But, Saturn hav\u00ad\ning no vifiblc fpots on his body, whereby to determine the time of his\nturning round his axis, thedength of Ins days and nights and the poiition\nof his axis are wholly unknown to us. He has two degrees forty-eight\nminutes north, and two degrees forty-nine minutes fouth, latitude. He\n\u2019 \u2018 No. 5.

His effects, when lord ofThe afLindant, or prin\u00ad\ncipal ruler of a nativity, with all his qualities, are as follow : he produces\na middle ftature, with a dark, fwarthy, or pale, complexion, fmall leer\u00ad\ning bLck eves, broad forehead, lean face, lowering brow, thick nofe\nand lips, large ears, black or brown hair, broad ihoulders, thin beard,\nwith fmall lean thighs and legs. If thia planet is wJl dignified at the\ntime of birth, the native will be of an acute and penetrating imagination ;\nin his condutil, auilere ; in words, ixibived ; in fpeaking and giving, very\nfpare ; in labour, patient ; in arguing or dilputjng, grave ; in obtaining\nthe good^ of this life, lludious and iolicitous ; in his attachments, either\nto wife or friend, confiant and unequivocal ; in prejudice or refentment,\nrigid and inexorable. But, if this planet be ill dignified at the time of\nbirth, the native will be naturally fordid, envious, covetous, miftruilful,\ncoward]}, fluggilh, outwardly diflcmbling, falfe, ftubborn, malicious,\nand'i'irpetually diflatished with himftlf, and with all about him. When\nSaturn is oriental, the human llature wiil be fhorter than ulual, and, when\noccidental, thin, lean, and lefs hairy. If his latitude be north, the na\u00ad\ntive will be hairy and corpulent ; it without any latitude, he will be of\nlarge bones and mufcles ; and, if meridional, fat, fmooth, and flefhv ; in\nhis full dation, llrong and well-favoured; and, in his f\u00e9cond dation,\nweak and ill-favoured. \"I hele remarks likewife hold good with rcfpedl\nto all the other planets.

She is an opaque globe, like the earth, and (bines only\nby reflecting the light^the Sun ; therefore, whilft that half of her which\nis towards the Sun is enlightened, the other part mull be dark and invifi-\nble. Hence (he difappears when (he comes between us and the Sun; be-\ncaufe her dark fide is then towards us. When (he is gone a little way\nforward, we fee a little of her enlightened fide; which ilill encreafes to\nour view as (he advances forward, until (he comes to be oppofite the fun,\nand then her whole enlightened fide is towards the earth, and (he appears\nwith around illumined orb, which we call the F u ll Moon*, her dark fide\nbeing then turned away from the earth.

And un\u00ad\nder thefe circumflances ihe becomes the moft powerful of all the heavenly\nbodies in her operations, by reafon of her proximity to the earth, and the\nfwiftnefs of her motion, by which ihe receives and tranfmits to us the\nlight and influence of all the fuperiers, by her configurations with them.\nWhen ihe has rule in a nativity, ihe produces a full ftature, with fair and\npale complexion, round face, grey eyes, lowering brow, very hairy, ihort\narms, thick hands and feet, l'mooth body, inclined to be fat, corpulent,\nand phlegmatic.

If the Moon be ill dignified at the birth, the\nnative will be then ilothful, indolent, and of no forecafl; given up to a\ndrunken, difordcrly, beggarly, life, hating labour, or any kind of bufinefs\nor employment.

She is computed to be fifty-nine millions o\u00a3\nmiles from the Sun, and, by moving at the rate of fixty-nine thoufand miles\nevery hour, ihe pafles through the twelve figns of the zodiac in two\nhundred and twenty-four days ieventeen hours of our time nearly. Her\ndiameter is feven thoufand nine hundred and fix miles, and by her diurnal\nmotion (lie is carried about her equator forty-three miles every hour, be\u00ad\nsides the fixty-nine thoufand above-mentioned. When file appears weft:\nof the Sun, ihe rifes before him in the morning, and is called the morning\nJ}ar-, but, when fhe appears eaft of the Sun, (he fhines in the evening after\nhe fets, and is then called the evening Jlar ; and continues alternately far\nthe fprxe of two hundred and ninety days in each of theie fituations. It\nmay perhaps be thought furprifing at firft, that Venus ihould continue\nlonger on the eaft or weft fide of the Sun than the whole time of her pe\u00ad\nriod round him ; but the difficulty vaniihes when we coniider that the\nearth is all the while going round the Sun the fame way, though not fo\nquick as Venus; and therefore her relative motion to the earth muft in\nevery period be as much flower than her abfolute motion in her orbit as the\nearth during that time advances forward in the ecliptic, which is two hun\u00ad\ndred and twenty degrees. T o us fhe appears through the telefcope in all\nthe various fhapes of the Moon. Her mean motion is fifty-nine minutes\neight f\u00e9conds ; and her daily or fwift motion is from fixty-two minutes\nto one degree twenty-two minutes ; but never greater. Her utmoft la\u00ad\ntitude, either north or fouth, never exceeds nine degrees two minutes. Her\nexaltation is in twenty-feven degrees of Pifces, her detriment in Aries and\nScorpio, and her fall in twenty-feven degrees of Virgo. She continues\nretrograde forty-two days, and is ftationary two days before and two days\nafter her ftate of r\u00e9trogradation.

If well dignified\nat the time of birth, the native will be of a quiet, even, and friendly, d if-.\npofition, naturally inclined to neatnefs, loving mirth and cheerfulnefs, and\ndelighting in muiic; amorous and prone to venery, though truly virtuous,\nif a woman; yet ihe will be given to jealoufy,* even without caufe. If\nthe planet be ill dignified, then will the native be riotous, profligate, a\u00ad\nbandoned to evil company and lewd women, regardlefs of reputation or\ncharacter; a frequenter of taverns, night-houfes, and all places of ill-\nfame ; delighting in all the incitements to incefluous and adulterous prac\u00ad\ntices; in principle a mere athieft, wholly given up to the brutal paffions\nof unbridled and uncultivated nature.

He completes\nhis revolution, or traverfes through the twelve figns of the zodiac, in eigh-\nty-fevendays and twenty-three hours of our time nearly ; which is the\nlength of his year. But, being leldom feen, on account of his proximity\nto the Sun, and having no fpots viiible on his furfacc or diik, the time of\nhis rotation upon his own axis, and the length of his days and nights, are\nas yet unknown to us. Hisdiftance from the Sun is computed to be thir\u00ad\nty-two millions of miles, and his diameter two thoufand lix hundred.\nHe moves round the Sun at the rate of ninety-five thoufand miles every\nhour ; and receives from that luminary a proportion of light and heat al-\nmoft feven times as great as that of the earth. At the times he becomes\nvifible, he appears of a bright lilver colour, though generally faint and\nduikifh to the naked eye. His mean motion is fifty-nine minutes and\neight f\u00e9conds, and fometimes fixty minutes ; and his diurnal motioy is\nmoll: times one hundred minutes a day. His greateft latitude,- both n\u00f4rth\n..nd lbuth, is three degrees thirty-three minutes. His exaltation is in\nfifteen degrees of Virgo; his detriment in Sagittarius and Pifces ; and\nhh fall in fifteen degrees of Pifccs. lie is retrograde twenty-four days ;\nand is ftationary one day before and one day after r\u00e9trogradation.

When he is in conjunc\u00ad\ntion with a mafculine planet, he is mafculine, when with a feminine pla\u00ad\nnet, feminine ; good and fortunate, when joined with the fortunes; but\nevil and mifchievous, when in conjunction with malevolent afpefts. When\nhe governs a nativity, he renders up a tall, ftraight, thin fpare body,\nnarrow face, and deep forehead ; long ftraight nofe, eyes neither black\nnor grey ; thin lips and chin, with but little beard ; brown complexion,\nand hazel or chefnut coloured hair ; the arms, hands, and fingers, long\nand (lender ; and thighs, legs, and feet, the fame. I f orientally pofited,\nthe ftature will be ihorter, with fandy hair, and fanguine complexion,\nfomewhat fun-burnt; the limbs and joints large and well fet, with fmall\ngrey eyes. But, if occidental, the complexion will be quite fallow, lank\nbody, fmall (lender limbs, hollow eves, of a red caft, and of a dry conftitu-\ntion. If Mercury be well dignified at the nativity, the perfon will inherit\na ftrong fubtil imagination, and retentive memory ; likely to become an\nexcellent orator and logician, arguing with much eloquence of fpeccb, and\nwith ftrong powers of perfuafion ; is generally given to the attainment of\nall kinds of learning ; an encourager of the liberal arts ; of a (harp, witty,\nand pleafant, convcrfation; of an unwearied fancy; and curious in the\nfearch of all natural and occult knowledge: with an inclination to travel\nor trade into foreign countries. If brought up in the mercantile line, he\nwill be ambitious of excelling in his merchandize, and will moft times\nprove luccefsful in obtaining wealth. But, if the planet be ill-dignified,\nthen the native will betray a difpofition to dander, and abufe the charac\u00ad\nter of every one without diftindion ; he will be a boaiter, a flatterer, a\niycophant, a buly-body, a tale-bearer, given to propagate idle tales and\nfalfe ftories; pretending to all kinds of knowledge, though a mere ideot\nin his intelledual faculty, and incapable of acquiring any (olid or fub-\nftantial learning; apt to boaft of great honefty, yet very much addide J\nto mean and petty thievery.\nd ;j:afts under M ercury.\u2014 A ll ,diforders of the brain, vertigoes, mad'\nneft, defects of the memory, convuliions, afthmas, imperfections of the\ntongue, hearfenefs, coughs, inuffling in the nofe, ltoppages in the heu\\\ndumbnels and whnever impairs the intelledual faculty, and gout in the\nhands and icet.

His\ndiameter is computed to befeven hundred and fixty-thrcc thoufand miles;\nand, by the various attractions of the circumvolving planets, he is agi\u00ad\ntated by a fmall motion round the centre of gravity of the l'yftem. He\npafies through the twelve Tigris of the zodiac in three hundred and fixty-\nfivedays, five hours, forty-eight minutes, and fifty-feven feconds, which\nforms the tropical or lolar year, by which ilandard all our periods of time\nare meafured.

Iiis exaltation is in nineteen degrees of Aries ; his detriment\nin Aquaries; and his fall in nineteen degrees of Libra. His orb or radia\u00ad\ntion is fifteen degrees before and after all hisafpedts. In man, he governs\nthe heart, back, arteries, the right eye of the male, and left of the female;\nand the retentive faculty. He prefides over Sunday, and Wedncfday\nnight. He is friendly with Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, and the\nMoon ; but is conftantly at variance with Saturn.\nThe Sun is in nature mafeuline, diurnal, hot, and dry, but more tem\u00ad\nperate than Mars, and, if well dignified, is always found equivalent to one\nof the Fortunes. When he prefides at a birth, the native is generally of\na large, honey, ftrong body, of a fallow fun-burnt complexion, large\nhigh forehead, with light or fandy curling hair, but inclined to be foon\nbald; a fine, full, piercing, hazel eye; and all the limbs ftraight and well\nproportioned. If he is well dignified, the native w ill be of a noble,\nmagnanimous, and generous, difpofition ; high-minded, but very humane;\nof a large and benevolent heart, affable, and courteous; in friendfhip,\nfaithful and fincere; in promifes flow, but pundual. The folar man is\nnot of many words ; but, when he fpeaks, it is with confidence, and to\nthe purpofc; he is ufually thoughtful, lecret, and referved; his deport\u00ad\nment is (lately and majeftic; a lover of fumptuoufnefs and magnificence;\nand poflefles a mind far fuperior to any fordid, bafe, or diihonourable,\npractices.

Thefe are neither figns nor conftella-\ntions, but are only the nodes or points wherein the ecliptic is interfered\nby the orbits of the planets,and particularly by that of the Moon; making\nwith it angles of five degrees and eighteen minutes. One of thefe points\nlooks northward, the Moon beginning then to have northern latitude;\nand the other points fouthward, where (he commences her latitude fouth.\nBut it muft be obferved, that thefe points do not always abide in one\nplace, but have a motion of their own in the zodiac, and retrograde-\nwife, three minutes and eleven feconds per day; completing their\ncircle in eighteen years and two hundred and twenty-five days; fo that\nthe Moon can be but twice in the ecliptic during her monthly period;\nbut at all other times the will have a latitude or declination from the\necliptic. The Head of the Dragon is confidcred of a benevolent nature,\nand almoft equivalent to one of the Fortunes, and when in afpeft with\nevil planets, is found to leflen their malevolent effeds in a very great\ndegree. But the Dragon\u2019s Tail I have always found of an evil and un\u00ad\nhappy tendency, not only adding to the malevolence of unfortunate af-\npeds, when joined with them ; but leflening confiderably the beneficial\ninfluences of the Fortunes, and other good afpe&s, whenever found in\nconjunftion with them.\nShould the reader be defirous of more particular information on the\nplanetary fyftem, I beg leave to recommend to his attentive perufal, the\nagronomical works of the ingenious M r.

F f O f\n\fj2 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nOf the PLANETARY HOUSES, and their EFFECTS.\nTo give a more fubftantial idea of the nature and arrangement of the\ntwelve houfes of the planets, we (hall confider them according to the\nfollowing diagram:\nIn this fcheme, Cancer and Leo have affigned unto them the two\ngreat luminaries, Sol and Luna; becaufe they are agreeable to each other\nin nature; for the Sun, being naturally hot and dry, ihews his effe&s more\nforcibly when pofited in Leo than he doth in either Aries or Sagittarius.\nAnd the Moon, for the fame reafon, has Cancer allotted to her govern\u00ad\nment, becaufe ihe is cold and moift, and of the nature of this iign; and,\nbeing the firfl of the watery triplicity, and next to the Sun's houfe, ihe\nreceives her light from him ; and all things are generated by their joint\ninfluence.\nSaturn is naturally cold, and therefore an enemy to heat; and, being the\nhighest and moil remote from the luminaries of all the other planets\/\nhas for his manlion the iigns Capricorn and Aquaries; which are the\noppcfite iigns to Leo and Cancer, and are confcquently cold and moift.\nSaturn is accounted the moil obnoxious and moil malevolent of all the\nplanets, becaufe he oppofes the two great luminaries, which are the\niountains of life, light, and nutrition.\nJupiter\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y .\nJupiter is placed under Saturn, and has the two ligns that go before\nand after Capricorn and Aquaries allotted for his houfes 5 namely, Sagit-\ntary and Pifces, which are in trine to the houfes of the two luminaries -,\nPifces, his night-houfe, is in trine to Cancer, the houfe of the no\u00e9\u00ecurnal\nluminary j and Sagittary, his day-houfe, in trine to Leo, the houfe of the\ndiurnal luminary. Jupiter, being naturally temperate, and having thefe\namicable alpefts, is deemed the moil benevolent o f all the planets to\nmankind, and the greater fortune.\n\/\nMars next in order follows Jupiter, being placed under him ; and there\u00ad\nfore thofe figns that go before and after the houfes of Jupiter are allot\u00ad\nted to Mars, viz. Scorpio and Aries, which are in quartile to the houfes\nof th\u00e8 Sun and Moon, as Aries\u2019s day-houfe is to Cancer, and Scorpio\u2019s\nnight-houfe is to Leo. And, fince a quartile is found to be an afped of\nenmity, he is accounted malignant and unfortunate in an inferior degree\nto Saturn, who beholds the luminaries with an oppoiition ; therefore he\nis called the lejfer infortunate.\nVenus, amore temperate planet, hath appointed unto her thofe houfes\nthat go before the houfes ot Mars, viz ; Libra and Taurus, which are in\na fextile to the houfes of the two luminaries, and form an alped of love\nand amity ; but, becaufe a fextile is not fo ftrong and perfed an afped as\na trine, flie is accounted the lejfer fortune.\nMercury, being fituated within the orbits of the other planets, has figns\nallotted him which precede the two houfes of the great luminaries, namely,\nGemini and Virgo; and, becaufe Mercury is never diilant from the Sun\nabove one fign, he naturally inclines neither to good nor evil, but parti\u00ad\ncipates either in the good or evil influences of whatever planet he is joined *\nwith in afped.\nThe E X A L T A T IO N S and F A L L S o f the P L A N E T S .\nThe Sun, which is the fountain of life, takes his exaltation in nine\u00ad\nteen degrees of Aries, becaufe he is then in the higheft northern point\nof the ecliptic, making all things to fpring and flouriih, and producing\nfine warm weather, and length of days. And he is faid to have his fall\nin Libra, becaufe it is the oppofite in the heavens to Aries, in which\nthe Sun declines to the utmoft fouthern point, and occafions ihortnefs\nof days, and cold winterly blafts, deftrutlive to the fruits of the earth.\nNow the Moon being contemporary with and partner to the Sun, and\nreceiving all her light from him, enables her to be vifible to us firft\nin Taurus ; and, becaufe it is the firft fign wherein (lie has a triplicity, her\nexaltation takes place in Taurus, wherein ihe increafcs in light and mo\u00ad\ntion.\n\f134 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\ntion. But Scorpio being the fign oppofite to Taurus, in which (he de-\ncreales in light, it is hence allotted for her fall, being the iign immedi\u00ad\nately after Libra, and oppofite to Aries, the houle of the Sun\u2019s exaltation.\nSaturn, the moil remote planet, is the author of cold, as the Sun is of\nheat, and is therefore exalted in that figa wherein heat is diminiihed and\ncold increafed, viz. Libra ; and his fall takes place in that fign where cold\nis diminiihed and heat increafed, viz. Aries ; which are quite contrary in\nnature to the Sun.\nJupiter is exalted in Cancer, and has his fall in Capricorn ; for Jupiter\ndelights in the noithern part of the heavens, where he ilirs up northern\nwinds, which increafe fertility and vegetation ; and, his higheil declina\u00ad\ntion northwards being in Cancer, he is therein exalted. For th\u00e9 contrary\nrcafon he has his fall in Capricorn.\nMars is naturally hot and dry ; and, becaufe his influence and efFe&s are\nmoil powerful in Capricorn, a fouthern fign, where the fun is generally\nhottcii about noon, he is for this rcafon exalted therein j and he takes his\ntall in Cancer, quite contrary to the nature of Jupiter; for Mars is hot and\n\\iuknt, rod Jupiter cool and temperate.\nVenus is naturally moill, tfpecially in Pifces, in which fign the fpring\nis rr.oiiteued and forwarded in the increafe and ftrength of nature; and\ntherefore the has the fign Pilces for her exaltation ; and, as Venus is the\nmother or generation and procreation, ihe has her fall in Virgo, in the\nautumn, when all things wither and fade.\nMercury, becaufe he is dry, and contrary in nature to Venus, is exalted\nm Virgo, and has his fall appointed him in Pifces. Virgo is both his\nLouie and joy.\nThe T R I P L I C I T I E S of the P L A N E T S .\nA Triplicity means three figns of the zodiac, of one and the fame\nnature, making a petfe\u00e9t triangle; and of thefe triplicities among the\nfigns there are four, anfwering to the four elements; viz. the fiery tri\u00ad\nplicity, v.hich conflits of Aries, Leo, and Sagittnry; the airy triplicity,\nconfiding of Gemini, Libra, and Aquaries ; the watery triplicity, con\u00ad\ntaining Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifces; and the earthy triplicity, which\nincludes Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Thefe figns apply to each other\nin a trine in the lame manner as a planet in a fiery fign applies to another\nplanet in a fiery fign (if in the fame number of degrees) in a trine; and\n\fo f a s t r o l o g y . 135\nthus a planet in an airy fign beholds another planet in an airy fign with\na trine; and fo the watery and earthy figns apply in the fame manner; and\neach of thefe trine afpefts con fifth of one hundred and twenty degrees.\nThe Sun and Jupiter have dominion over the fiery triplieity ; the Sun\nby day, and Jupiter by night. The Sun by day, bccauie he is hot and\nfiery, and of the nature of thefe figns; and Jupiter by night, becaufe he\nis temperate, and moderates the extremity of heat. This is called the\neailern triplieity.\nSaturn and Mercury have dominion over the airy triplieity, winch Is\nweftern ; Mercury by night, and Saturn by day. But, as Libra is the ex\u00ad\naltation of Saturn, and Aquaries the houfe and fign wherein he has moft\njoy, and as Gemini is only the houfe of Mercury, it follows that Saturn\nhas the principal government in this triplieity.\nMars, both night and day, governs the watery tiiplicity, which is nor\u00ad\nthern ; and it feems that Mars was appointed to this triplieity to temper\nand abate his violent heat; for we find he is more powerful in his malig\u00ad\nnant effetls in the fign Leo tHn he is in Cancer, therefore he has his\nfall appointed him in Cancer, though he is peregrine in Leo.\nVenus and the Moon bear rule over the earthy triplieity, which is\nfeminine and fouthern, cold and moift, producing fouth-eaft winds\nand cold moift air; hence this triplieity is afiigned to the care of femi\u00ad\nnine planets.\nThe T E R M S of the P L A N E T S .\nA Term is a certain number of degrees, in each houfe or fign of the\nzodiac, wherein the planets Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury,\nhave a certain priority; but the Sun and Moon have no terms. Thefe\ndegrees are called terms, ends, or bounds; for the planets have each their\nproportions fo allotted therein, that, at the end of a certain number of\ndegrees, the terms of one planet ceale, and thofe of another begin. For\ninliance, from the firft degree of Aries to the fixth aie the terms of Ju\u00ad\npiter; from the fixth to the fourteenth are the terms of Venus; and fo\nof all the reft. Ptolemy, Albumazer, and Bonatus, have all (hewn that\nthe greater years of the planets are diicovered by their leveral terms or\nbounds through the zodiac; which is done by finding what number of\ndegrees each of the planets have allotted them in each fign ; and then, by\nadding them together, the fum will be the number of each of their great\nyears, as will appear more obviouily by the following example ;\nNo. 7.

If an infortune has not two dig\u00ad\nnities in a fign, he is placed lail, and the firil term is given either to the\nlord of the exaltation, or to the lord of the triplicity, or to the lord\nof the houfe, uniformly preferring that planet which has two dignities\nto thole that have only one. But an exception to this rule extends to the\nfigns Cancer and Leo; for Cancer being the oppofite fign to the exalta\u00ad\ntion of Mars, which is in Capricorn, occafions the firil term of Cancer\nto be afiigned to M ars; and, becaufe Leo is the oppofite fign to the*houfe\nand joy of Saturn, the firil term of Leo is for this reafon given to Sa\u00ad\nturn. T o the infortuncs are allotted the lail degrees of all the figns, ex\u00ad\ncepting thofe of Leo, which are given to Jupiter. The quantity of terms\nare divided according to the following method : when Jupiter and Ve\u00ad\nnus have not two dignities in the fame fign, nor in the fecond, third, or\ntourth, houfe, they have feven degrees allotted for their terms. Saturn\nand Mars, becaufe they are infortunes, (except in their own houfes,) have\nbut five, and fometimes only four, three, or two, degrees each. Mercu\u00ad\nry, becaufe he is of a mixed nature, has ufually fix degrees allotted him ;\nbut, when any of the planets are eflentially dignified, they claim each one\ndegree more;, as Venus in the firil term of Taurus has eight degrees, and\n3 Saturn\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 137\nS\natu\nrnIn th\nefirft termof A\nquaries claim\ns fix.

The reafon\nis, that in Aquaries he has both houfe and triplicity, and is therefore bet-;\nter dignified, and more potent, in Aquaries than in Capricorn. So like-\nwife Jupiter joyeth in Sagittary, and notin Pifces, becaufe in the former\niign he has both houfe and triplicity, but in the latter he has houfe:\nonly. The fame obfervation extends to the other planets. The Moon,\nindeed, has no triplicity; but fhe joyeth in Cancer, becaufe it is a fign>\nof her own quality and nature. Hence it appears that Saturn, though ftrong\nand well dignified in Capricorn, is much ftronger, and has more digni\u00ad\nties, in Aquaries; Jupiter alfo has ftrong influences when pofited in\nPifces, but much ftronger in Sagittary; Mars is potent in Aries, but\ninfinitely more fo in Scorpio ; Venus has great operation in Libra, but\nin Taurus her effefts are more powerful; and Mercury, for the fame\ncaufe, operates much more forcibly in Virgo than he does in the fign\nGemini. The efficacy of thefe rules having been proved by repeated\nexperience, it is neceflary for every ftudcnt to confider them with\nattention.\nThe A N T I S C I O N S of the P L A N E T S .\nA planet\u2019s antifcion is a certain virtue or influence it acquires by\nbeing pofited in conjunilion with any ftar or planet, in degrees equally dif-\ntant from the two tropical figns, Cancer and Capricorn, in which degrees\nthe Sun, when it arrives, occafions equal day and night all over the world.\nFor example, when the Sun is in the tenth degree of Taurpfy he is as far\ndiftant from the firft degree of Cancer as when in the ssdkfidl degree o f\nLeo; therefore, when the Sun, or any planet, is pofited in the tenth degree\nof Taurus, it fends its antifcion to the twentieth degree o f Leo; that\nis, it gives additional force and virtue to any planet at that time in the\nfame degree by conjunftion, or that cafteth any afpe\u00a3t to it.

The Textile is term\ned anafped of im\nperfect love,\nam\nity, or friendihip; becaufe, w\nhentwo planets, or fignificators, are in\nTextile to each other, they im\nport that any m\natter in difpute, treaty of\nm\narriage, or other fubjed of enquiry, m\nay be happily term\ninated, or\nbrought about, by the intervention of friends; or that for want thereof,\nthe contrary m\nay happen. And, though the Textile afped is fom\netim\nes\nover-ruled by the m\nore powerful influences of m\nalignant ones, yet it\nis generally confidered an om\nen of the favourable kind.\nBy a quartile afped, \u25a1 , two planets are underftood to be poiited at\nninety degrees, or one fourth part of the circle of the zodiac, fromeach\nother; whence it is alfo called a quadrangular or tetragonal afped. The\nquartile is confidered an afped of imperfed hatred ; and acts vice verfi\nwith the fextile, inclining rather to m\nalignancy, contention, and mis\u00ad\nfortune, a\nstheother does tofriendihip, harmony, and good fortune.\nA trine afped, a , im\nports the planets to be fituated at the diftance of\none hundred andtwenty degrees, or one third part of the circle of the\nzodiac, from each other; and is fom\netim\nes called a trigonal afped, or\na trigonocrater, implying rule or dom\ninion in acertain trigon or tripli-\ncity. This is an afped of the moil perfed unanim\nity, friendihip, a\nn\nc\n*\npeace; and it is fo confidered, becaufe, when the planets are in aa afped\nthey are pofited in figns precifely of the fam\ne triplicity and nature ; that\nis to fay, they are both in an earthy, airy, fiery, or watery, fign ; and\nconfequently both contribute the fam\ne influences unim\npeded. But, in a\n*, which is an afped of imperfed amity, the planets are poiited in\nfigns of only a partial nature, viz. fiery with an airy, or a\nn earthy with a\nwatery, fign; and, a\nsthe fieryfignishot anddry9 andtheairyhotandmoift;\nthe earthy cold and dry, and the watery cold and moift ; fo the planets\nthus pofited, agreeing only in one point out oftwo, give but an imperfed\ninfluence. Thus the diftindions betw\neen a* and a aiped, and between\na\u25a1an\nd \u00a3, are founded in reafon and experience.\nThe oppofition 8 of two planets, fignifies their being poiited at one\nhundred andeighty degrees, orjuft half the diftance of the zodiac, apart,\nwhich places them diam\netrically oppofite toone another inthe heavens,\nw\nhence it is called a diam\netrical radiation. This is confidered an afped\nof perfed hatred, or of inveterate m\nalice and enmity, a\ns m\nalignant in\nits effeds a\ns the trine is benevolent; and of double the deilrudive ten\u00ad\ndency of the d afped. To inftance this, let us fuppofe two kingdoms,\nftates, focictics, or private gentlem\nen, at variance, and it is enquired whe\u00ad\nth\ner thecaufeof difpute m\nay be amicably adjufted ?If afigure be ereded\nNo. 7. .

Having eftabliflied the\nSun, Moon, or afeendant, a\nsfignificators\u201eQfJife, and M\nars oxJSaturn a\ns\npfom\nittors or portentors of death, the direction is acalculation of the\nlength of tim\nein which the fignificator will be in m\neeting the prom\nittor ;\nand this refolves the queftion.

Not that a planet ever is or can be naturally inthis\nftate, but is only rendered fo in appearance, by the inequalities which\narife from the pofitions and m\notions of the earth; for, were the planets\nto be viewed from the Sun,~or centre of the fyftera, they would always\nappear uniform and regular.\nR \u00e9 t r o g r a d a t io n implies an apparent m\notion in the planets,\nwhereby they feem to go backwards in the ecliptic, and to m\nove in ante-\ncedentia, or tow\nards theantecedent Iigns, viz. fromeaft to weft, contrary\nto the order of direction and to the fucceflion of the iigns of the zodiac.\nThis alfo is anappearance produced by an oppofite m\notion of the earth to\nthat of theplanets.\nA p p l ic a t io n fignifies the approach of two planets together, either\nby conjunctionorafpect, and is of three kinds : the firft is, whenapla\u00ad\nnet, fwift inm\notion, applies to oneof flower progrefs; forexam\nple, fup-\npofe Mercury pofited in fixteendegrees of Gemini, and M\nars in twenty-\none degreesof the fam\ne fign, both being direct in m\notion; Mercury, by\nhaving the greaterapparent projectile force, would overtake andforma\nNo. 7.

The f\u00e9\u00ad\ncond kind is form\ned by two retrograde planets ; as, fuppofing Mercury\nin fixtecn degrees of Gemini, an\nd Saturn in fifteen degrees of the fam\ne\nfign, both retrograde, Mercury, being the lighter planet, applies to the\nbody of Saturn, a m\nore ponderous planet, by r\u00e9trogradation ; an\ndthis is\nterm\ned a retrograde application. The third kind is occaiioncd by one\nplanet going directin'Thofion, and m\neeting another planet that is retro\u00ad\ngrade; for inftancc, fuppofe Mercury retrograde in fixteen degrees of\nGemini, and Saturn direct in twelve degrees of the fam\ne fign ; here\nMercury, being thelighter planet, applies to a conjunction of Saturn by\na retrograde m\notion ; and thefe two lait aredeem\ned evil applications. It\nm\null alfo be obferved that the fuperior planets never apply to the inferior\nbut by a retrograde m\notion ; w\nhereas the inferior planets apply bptfi ways.\nS e p a r a t i o n is underilood of two planets that have either been in\npartile conjunction or afpect, and are juft departed or feparated from\nit. Thus, if w\ne fuppofe Saturn in twelve degrees of Sagittary, andJu\u00ad\npiter in thirteen degrees of the fam\ne fign, Jupiter will be then feparated\none degree from a perfeCl or partile conjunction with Saturn; but they\nwould ftill be in a platic conjunction, becaufe they arewithin the moiety\nof each others radiations, which is four degaees an\nd ahalf each, confc-\nquently thele planets would continue in platic conjunction until they\nw\nere feparated nine degrees, and then the alpect would entirely ceafe.\nThe exact knowledge of every degree of the reparations of thefe afpects\nis of the utm\noft coniequcnce in giving judgment upon various im\npor\u00ad\ntant occafions. For inltance, fuppofe it w\nere dem\nanded whether acer\u00ad\ntain treaty of m\narriage would take place, or not ? When all the afpects\narecollected upon the horofeope, an\nd the two planets, that.are fignifica-\ntors of the parties, are found applying to each other in a conjunction,\nand incom\nm\non or fixed figns, the m\narriage m\nay probably take place in\nfom\nc length of tim\ne. If the fignificators are pofited in m\noveable figns,\nangular, and approaching fwift in m\notion to aconjunction, it may'then\nbe confum\nm\nated ina very fhort tim\ne ; but, if thefignificators are fepara\u00ad\nted from aconjunction only a few m\ninutes of a degree, one\u2019m\nay Tafely\nconclude that there h\nas been great probability, only a few days before,\nthat the weddingwould have taken place; but by this afpect the parties\nappear to be hangingjn^ fufpence, and fom\ne diilike or change ol ienti-\nm\nent feem\ns to have taken place : and, as the fignificators gradually fepa-\nrate fromthe partile and platic conjunctions, in the fam\ne giadation will\nthe treaty and affections of the parties alienate an\nd w\near aw\nay ; and, by\nthe com\nparative tim\ne that theafpect will occupy before it entirely ceafes,\nfo will the tim\ne be fo m\nany weeks, m\nonths, or years, before the parties\n(hall wholly relinquish the connection.\nProhibition\n\fOF A S T ROL OGY . 4\n9\nP r o h i b i t i o n indicates the ihte of two planets that a\nre fignificators\nof fom\neevent, o\nrthe bringingof fom\ne bufinefs to a\nn \u00a1flue orconclufion,\na\nn\nd a\nreapplying toeachother by conjun. iion ; but, beforefuch conjunc\u00ad\ntion can be form\ned, athirdplanet, by m\nean\ns of a fw\nifter m\notion, inter-\np\no\nfes his body, an\nd deiiroys the expcfted conjunction, by form\ning an\nafp\neC\nt himfelf; an\nd this indicates that the m\natter u\nn\nder contem\nplation\nwill b\ne greatly retarded, or utterly prevented. For exam\nple, fuppofe\nM\nars w\nere pofited in feven degrees of Aries, Saturn in tw\nelve degrees,\nan\nd the Sun infixdegrees, of the fam\nefign ; M\nars is the fignificator of\nthebufinefs inhand, an\nd prom\nifes the iflue or com\npletion of it fo foon\na\ns h\ne com\nes to aconjunction with Saturn; but the-Sun, beingfw\nifter in\nm\notion thanM\nars, p\na\nffC\nsbrim, an\ndprevents their conjunction, by form\ning\nthe afpert him\nfclf. This indicates, that w\nhatever w\nas expeC\nted fromthe\napproaching conjunction of M\nars an\nd Saturn is now prohibited by the\nSun's firft im\npediting M\narsan\ndthen Saturn ; an\ndthis is term\nedaconjunc\u00ad\nt io n a l ox bodily prohibition. There is alfo aprohibition by afpefi, either\nfextile, quartile, trine, or oppofition; an\nd this happens w\nhen two pla\u00ad\nn\nets a\nre going into conjunction.

To inftance this, fuppofe\nS\natu\nrn pefited in fixteen degrees ot Gem\nini, Jupiter in fifteen degrees of\nLeo, an\nd M\nars in eleven degrees of the fam\ne fign ; here M\nars applies to\naconjunction with Jupiter, but, before he can reach it, Jupiter m\neets\n\u00ab\n*fextileafp\ned\nt fromSaturn, which fruftrates the conjunction of M\nars,\na\nn\nd\n, in practice, utterly deftroys w\nhatever w\nasprofiled by it.\n0\nR e f r a n a t i o n isthe ftateof aplanet in direct m\notion, applying to\na\nnafpect or conjunction with another planet, but before they can m\neet\nb\neco\nm\nes retrograde, an\ndthus refrains to formthe afpect expected.

The effect of this in practice will be, that, if a m\natter or\nthing be prom\nifed by Saturn, then whoever w\nas reprefented by M\nars\nfhall procure all the affiftance that the benevolent planet Jupiter could\nheftow, and tranflate it to Saturn, whereby the buiinefs in hand would be\nthe better effected, and m\nore happily concluded ; and this, being a very\nfortunate pofition of the planets, is very proper to be known, fince it pro-\nm\nifes m\nuch in lawfuits, m\narriages, and all other queftions of the kind.\nR eception is when two planets, that are fignificators inanyqueftion\nor nativity, arepoiited in each other\u2019s dignity, a\ns the Sun in Aries, and\nM\nars in Leo, which is a reception by houfes, and is deem\ned the moil\npowerful andefficacious of all receptions. But reception m\nay be by ex\u00ad\nchange oftriplicity, term\n, orphafe, orby anyeifentiardignity ; a\ns Venus\nin Aries, and the Sun in Taurus, is areception by triplicity, if the quef\u00ad\ntion or nativity happen by day. Or if Venus\u201cbe in the twenty-fourth\ndegree of Aries, and M\nars in the iixteenth degree of Gemini, it is a re\u00ad\nception by term\ns. The ufc of thefe poiitions in practice is coniiderable ;\nfor, fuppoie the event of any queilion required be denied by the afpefts,\nor the fignificators are in no afpe& with each other; or it is doubtful\nwhat m\nay happen from a quartile oroppofition of the fignificators; yet,\nif the principal fignificators are found in m\nutual reception, the thing\ndefired will ihortly com\ne to pafs, and probably to the fatisfa&ion and\ncontent of all theparties concerned.\nP e r e g r i n a t i o n deferibes a planet to be fituated in a fign, or in\niiich certain degrees of a fign, where it has no effential dignity, either\nby houfe, exaltation, triplicity, term\n, or phafe; a\ns Saturn in the tenth\ndegree of_Aries, is peregrine; and the Sun, in any part of Cancer, is\nperegrine, having no dignity whatever inTthat fign. Inall queftions of\ntheft, it is very m\naterial to know the peregrine planet; for it has been\nuniformly found, by alm\noft every regular profeiTor of this Art, that the\nthief m\nay be alm\noft conftantly dilcovercd by the peregrineplanet pofited\ninin angle, or in the fccond houfe. \"\nC o m bu stio n istheftateof a planet, when fituated within eight de\u00ad\ngrees thirty m\ninutes of the body of the Sun, either before or after him.\nSoippofeMercury in the twenty-firft degree, the Sun in the twenty-fifth\ndegree,\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 151\ndegree, an\nd Venus in the twenty-feventh degree of Aquaries; here\nMercury an\nd Venus would h\ne both combuit; but Venus would be\nm\nore affed\nted by it than Mercury, becaufe the Sun applies to, or m\noves\ntow\nards Venus, an\nd recedes from Mercury, whereby his rays afflidt her\nm\noreforcibly on his n\nearer approach, an\nd becom\ne w\neaker upon M\nercury\nby his recefs fromhim\n.\nCazim i reprefents a planet in the heart of the Sun ; thatis, if aplanet\nbe only feventeen m\ninutes before or after theSun, a\ns if the Sun w\nere in\nfifteen degrees thirty m\ninutes of Taurus, an\ndMercury in fifteen degrees\ntwenty m\ninutes of the fam\ne fign, Mercury would be then in cazimi, or\nin the heart of the Sun. All authors agree that aplanet in cazim\ni is for\u00ad\ntified thereby, an\ndis ofgreater efficacy ; w\nhereas a planet in com\nbuition\nis ofam\nalignant nature. If the fignificator of a querent, or perfon pro\u00ad\npounding aqueftion, be com\nbuft, it (hew\ns him or her to beunder fearful\napprehenG\nons, and threatened to be over-powered, or greatly injured by\nfom\ne fuperior perfon. It fhould be carefully obferved, that all planets\nm\nay b\neincom\nbuition with theSun, but the Sun cannot be in coinbuftion\nwith any planet; and that com\nbuition canonly be by pcrfonal conjunc\u00ad\ntion in onefign, and not byany afpedt, either Textile, quartile, trine, or\noppofition ; the Sun's quartileoroppofite afpedtsareafflicting, but theydo\nnot com\nbure, or render the planet combuit.

By this\noperation, the whole globe or fphere will be apportioned into twelve\nequal parts, which conftitute what w\ne call, the twelve houfes o f heaven.\nAnd thefe houfes, a\ns obfervation and experience abundantly fhew, m\nake\nup that great wheel of nature, w\nhereon depends the various fortunes con\u00ad\ntingent to all fublunary m\natters and things.\nIn this divifion of the heavens, the firft quadrant isdeferibed by a pa\u00ad\nrallel line, draw\nn from the point of the eaft angle to the fouth, or mid\u00ad\nheaven ; and contains the twelfth, eleventh, andtenth, houfes, called the\noriental, vernal, m\nafeuline, fanguine infant quarter.

The angular houfes are four,\ncalled the afcendant, m\nidheaven or m\nedium cceli, the feventh houfe, and\nthe bottom of the heaven; thefeare deem\ned the moil powerful andm\noil\nfortunate houfes.

But, notwithftanding they\narc divided into only three claffes, or orders, whereby their force and ef\u00ad\nficacyare cftim\nated, yet isthere a regular gradationin this refpeft running\nthrough the whole, whereby one houfe is fubordinate tothe other, from\nfirft to laft. Confidered in this order, they H\nan\ndthus;\n1 JO 7 4 n 5 9 3 2 8 6 12.\nAccording\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . tS7\nAccording to this rule, if we find two planets, equally ftrong and\nof the fam\ne dignities, one pofited in the firft houfe and the other in the\ntenth, wejudge the planet in the firft houfe, or afcendant, to have fupe-\nriority over the planet inthe tenth houfe; and, inpractice, we infer, from\nfuch apofition, that the perfon, whofe fignificator w\nas in the firft houfe\nwould get the better of his opponent, whofe fignificator w\nas in the tenth\nhoufe; but, both being fo nearly equal in point of dignity, great drug\u00ad\ngies and difficulties would intervene, as the nature of the cafe in point\nm\nay happen to be. This rule holds good from the tenth houfe to the\nfeventh; the feventh to the fourth, and lb on through the whole ; but\nit fhould always be rem\nem\nbered that planets in angles, that is, thofe\nwhich are feated in theangular houfes, are the mojl forcible and potent\nintheir operation.\nThe firft houfe, which is denoted by the figure 1, is called the afcen\u00ad\ndant, becaufe, the point of its angle being level with the horizon, what\u00ad\never planet afcends fromunder the earth muftafcend upon this line, and\nbecom\ne vifible firft in this houfe. The line upon which the planets\nafcend, or m\nove, is called the cufp of the houfes; and that of the afcen\u00ad\ndant isgenerally reckoned to extend about five degrees above the earth\nan\nd twenty-five degrees beneath, ready to afcend. But, if figns of long\nafcenfions afcend, then half five degrees above the earth, an\nd thirteen bel\u00ad\nlow, are its utm\noft limits. If figns offhort afcenfions afcend, then five\ndegrees above the horizon, and fifty degrees below, are uftially allowed. .\nNow the quality of whatfoever part of theheavens occupies or fills up the\ndegrees of this houfe, carries along with it the health, life, an\nd nature, of\neveryinfant or thing that isconceived or brought forth within itsjuridic\u00ad\ntion. And hence hath this point of theheavens afaculty ofattractingor\nreceiving the virtues of theceleftial m\natter that is accidentally afeendm\ng\ninthat part of heaven at the birth ; andalfo of the planets and fixed ftars\nin their tranfits ; and all the rays of the planets, in their afpects an\nd con\u00ad\njunctions, areattracted into this part of heaven, in order to theform\nation .\nof the fhape, ftature, tem\nperatureofthe body, quality ofthem\nind, andall\naccidents and contingencieswhich ihalLbefal the native's body, orhealth,\no\nr life, unto his dying day ; fuch a fym\nJJathy is there betw\neen this part *\nof th\ne heavenly fram\ne and of every ad\nt and thing that is produced or\nthat receives life under it. For, a\ns\n-the feed in the ground, after it has\ntaken root, buds forth, andappears above groound, fo the heavenly in\u00ad\ntelligencers, after they have fram\ned the em\nbryo, and the tem\nperam\nent\nthereof, underthe earth, give it life and being of its own, putting forth\nlevel w\nith themjuft as they afcend.

For any m\nan to be fatisfied in this\npoint, let him but note what the nature of this afeending point of hea\u00ad\nven is, with all the ftars an\nd planets pofited therein, or having afpedl\nwith them from other houfes, giving each of them theirdue weight and\ninfluence, according to their natureand dignity, neither drained oneway\nnor the other; and, juft a\ns thefe are found at the tim\ne of birth, juft fo\nfhall be found the qualities and endowm\nents of that native, with the\nprincipal adtions and events of his life, which this point afeending takes\nthe charge of. And in this trial will the reader find m\nore fubftantial\nproofs of the truth and exiftence of Aftiology than the mod acute argu\u00ad\nm\nents can inftil into his m\nind.\nNow, fince the firft houfe, or afeendaqt, gives birthand life to the na\u00ad\ntive, it follows that thofe houfes which are the attendants on and up\u00ad\nholders of life, ihould bejoined with it; and, a\ns children, or the native\u2019s\noffspring, are the upholders of life in this world, and religion and learn\u00ad\ning the grand m\neans of upholding it unto eternity in the other world, fo\nthehoules, which contribute thefe blefiings to the life already given, are\njoined in an harm\nonious trine with the firft houfe, making up that three\u00ad\nfold cord, which, as Solom\non faith, can never be broken; the one is a\nfuccedent houfe, called the fifth houfe, and the other a cadent houfe,\ncalled the ninth houfe; and, to be convinced of the effects of this fifth\nhoufe, note the heavenly m\natter, planets, ftars, and afpeits therein po\u00ad\nin\nted at the tim\ne of birth, according tothe ruleshere laiddown, and they\nfhall truly reprefent the num\nber and ftatc of the native\u2019s offspring, and\nall other particulars relativetochildren, andtobreedingor barrenwom\nen*\nSoalfo exam\nine the ftate of the^^Bnth houfe ; and, a\ns that reprefents,\nfo (hall the native be in refpedt of religion and fcience ; for the neavenly\nm\natter, planets, ftars, andafpe~is therein, fhall ihew what and how the\nm\nan fliall prove, whether wife or foolifh, devout or fchifmatical, an\nd\nwhat ftudy or occupation he fliall be inclined to follow ; and theie fur-\nnifli m\natter for grace to work upon ; but, a\ns for grace itfelf, nature can\nhave no power over it; grace m\nay rule nature, but nature cannot fway\nThe\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . \u00bb\n5\n9\nThe fecond angular point of the houfes of heaven is called the mid\u00ad\nheaven, which is that point which culm\ninates, being the very top or\nhigheft point of the heavenly fram\ne. And, whatever part of the heavens\nhappens to be culminating in this point at the birth of any perfon or\nthing, that takes charge of, and carries along with it, ever after, the pre\u00ad\nferm\nent, honour, profeflion, fituation, and authority, of the native ; and,\na\ns the nature of the planets, ftars, afpefts, and heavenly m\natter, happens\nto be, that are iituated in this point, or in the degrees pertaining to it,\nfo fhall the native proveinhis life-time, in pointof dignity, advancem\nent,\nand reputation, in this world, whether high or low, fortunate or unfor\u00ad\ntunate, favouredor difgraced. The attendants upon, and upholders of,\nm\nan\u2019s honour and dignity, as the Scriptures and every day\u2019s experience\nperpetually ihew us, are weahh and fervants. The firft of thele is at\u00ad\ntached to the m\nidheaven in afuccedent hotrie, called the fecond houfeof\nheaven; andthe other in acadenthoufe, calledthe fixth houfeof heaven;\nand thefe two are fituated in an harm\nonious trine with the angular point\nof the m\nidheaven. And now well obferve what the planets, ftars, aif\nspcXs, and heavenly m\natters, are in either of thefe houfes at the tim\ne of\nbirth, and fuch ihall the native\u2019s fortune prove in point of riches and\nfubordinate dependants; in the firft of thefe houfes for wealth, and in\nthe other for iervants or dependants.\nThe third angle of the figureof heaven is the feventh houfe, or point\nof the heavens and degrees contingent, which are always defeending, or\nfetting out of our horizon, and finking under the earth; and this point\nis dircXly oppofite to the eaftern angleor afeendant. Now, a\ns the riling\nheaven, or afeendant, is the begianingand conduit of life, fo this^fet-\nting heaven, level with the afeendant, is the bringing all m\nundane\naffairs level with life, fuch as our entrance into the ft3fe\"oY marriage;\nour contraXs and enterprifes in bufinefs, war, and travel; and our con\u00ad\nnexions and fuccefs therein, whether with friends, ftrangers. orenemies;\nan\nd thefe w\n'hether honeft m\nen, parafites, or thieves. And the heavenly\nm\natter, planets, ftars, andafpeXs, fituated in this angleat a nativity, appa\u00ad\nrently fhew how a m\nan ihall fare in refpeX to wives, m\noreorlefs, anyor\nnone, good or bad ; and, in m\natters of bufinefs or adventure, howfortu\u00ad\nnate or unfortunate he m\nay be likely to prove; and, withenem\nies or\nthieves, howfar he is likely to be injured by them\n. Neceffaiy upholders\nof m\narriage, fupporters in trade and travel, and defenders againft thieves,\nplunderers, and enem\nies, are friends, relations, and neighbours. And\nthefe, inatrine to the feventhhoule,~ar\u2019\nebrought Forth, the firft out of\nthe eleventh houfe of heaven a fuccedent houfe, and the other out of the\nthird houfe of heaven, a cadent houfe. The eleventh houfe, by the pla-\n-No. 8. N n nets,\n\fi6o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nnets, ftars, afpedls, and heavenly m\natter, therein, points out the ftate of\na m\nan\u2019s friends and hopes in this life; and the third houfe defcribes, by\nthe fam\ne m\neans, how happy or unhappy a m\nan \u00a3\nh\nall prove in his rela\u00ad\ntions, connections, and neighbours.\nThe lad angle of heaven is the fourth houfe, called the bottom of\nheaven, and reprefcnts that point which lirour conception feecn\ns tirtratig\nat the very bottomof the round ball of the celeftial world, being diam\ne\u00ad\ntrically oppofjte to the exterior, orjnidheaven. And, as that ihews what\na m\nan in the courfeof nature ihall rife to in the world, this, on the con\u00ad\ntrary, declares what and w\nhen ihall be his fall, decay, and death. This\nhoufe has therefore fignification of the end of every worldly concern,\nand, am\nongftother ends, of the grave, which is the end of all m\nen liv\u00ad\ning, however dignifiedor great. And the planets, ftars, and afpefts, po\u00ab\nfited in this houfe at the tim\ne of birth, never fail to ihew what kind of\nend the native is likely to find; for, as the twelve figns have each their\n.particular and vifible effefts upon and over every part of m\nan\u2019s body, and\nas the planets and their afpects ihew in what fign the native ihall be im-\npedited, that is, in what part of the body the root of hisnatural infirmity\nihall be placed, and what accidents ihall befal him during life, fo is it\nan eafy procefs to point out the m\nannerof his death, and whethernatural,\nhonourable, or ignominious. The upholdersof this angle arethe houfes\nof tribulation anddeath; the one a lucccdent houfe, called the eighth\nhoufe, or houfe of death ; and the otheracadent houfe, called the twelfth\nhoufe. And nowlet it be carefully obferved what planets, ilars, afpeCts,\nand heavenly m\natter, occupy thofe houfes at the time of nativity ; and\nthey ihall point out, in the twelfth houfe, all the principal m\nisfortunes,\nafflictions, and tribulations, of thenative\u2019s life, and in the eighth houfe\nthe tim\ne and m\nanner of his death.\nIndependent of the faculties hitherto fpecified, each of thefe houfes of\nheaven haveother fignifications and effects, which they dem\nonffrate in\nvarious other ways. For inftance, the afeendantreprefents the native\ncoming intothe. world, an\nd the fourth houfe at the fam\ne time repre\u00ad\nfents the parents of the nativegoing out j for one generation goes off, and\nanother always comes in-{-, according to the courfe of nature. Of thefe\nparents, the father is m\nore efpecially fignified by the fourth houfe;\nand then, fecondarily, but not foforcibly, the m\notherof thenative isfig\u00ad\nnified by the tenth houfe, and the grandfather by thefeventh; anduncles,\naunts, andrelations, on thefather\u2019s fide, by the fixth; and uncles, aunts,\nt See Ecclcf. i. 4. -\nand\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . l6i\nand relations, on the m\nother\u2019s fide, by the twelfth\u00ab Hence alfoit com\nes\nto pafs, that by the fourth houfearefignifiedhoufes andlands, andall de\u00ad\ngrees of patrim\nony, left by the father; and by the eighth houfeare ihcwn\nall goods and legacies left by will of the deceafed. The fecond and fixth\nhoufes in half-trine tothe houfeof the grave, and in oppolitibn to the\neighth andtwelfth, have afecondary fignification of iicknefs and death.\nSuch are the qualities andoperations of the twelve houfes of heaven\nin the com\nm\non courfe of nature; but thefe qualities af t fom\netim\nes m\na\u00ad\nterially altered, and changed for the better or worfe, by m\neans either of\nthe m\noon or fom\ne other of the celeftial m\notions oraffediions. It is cer\u00ad\ntain that the Moon circleththeearth once inevery twenty-eight days; but\ninthis peram\nbulation ihe neither keepsthe Sun\u2019s pathway in the ecliptic,\nnor continues her courfe conftantly on the fam\ne fide of it; but once in\nevery fourteen days ihe crofles the ecliptic, alternately to her north and\nfouth declination; and it is found by long and corredt obfervation, that\nthe point in the heavens where ihe crofles this line is very ftrongly af-\nfedted by her m\notion. The Moon is the great body of life and growth ;\nand, when ihe paflcs theecliptic to the north, which brings her nearer\ninto this northern world, ihe thengives an extraordinary degree ofjruit-\nfulnefs, which wonderfully ftrengthens with its influence whatloever\nhappens within the line of its juriididtion. And this point, wherever it\nfalls, is called the m\noon\u2019s north node, but is diitinguiihed in aftrological\nworks by the nam\ne of the Dragon\u2019s Head, as already explained in page\n125. If this point happens toafcend inanativity, it ftrengthens life with\na rpbuft and lively conftitution ; if it falls in the mid-heaven, it prom\nifes\ngreat honour and preferment; if in the eleventh houfe, profperity and\nriches. If Jupiter or Venus happen to be in thefe degrees, it m\nakes them\nm\nuch ftronger and m\nore efficacious in their benevolent operations; bur,\nif Saturn or M\nars be poiited there, it gives them, on the contrary, a\nftronger inclination to prove mifehievous and unfortunate. When the\nm\noon interfedls the ecliptic line to her fouthern declination, ihe leaves\nthat point of the heavens where fhe crofles it, which is term\nedtheJDrag*\non\u2019s Tail, as barren to all intents and*purpofes as the other w\nas fruitful.\nHence this point afeending at a nativity blemiihes-life, and leaves a ftain\nupon it; im\npairs honour andadvancem\nent inthe m\nid-heaven, and waftes\nriches, and brings adverfity, intheeleventh houfe ; an\nd it w\neakens aswell\nthe benevolent aufpices ofJupiter and Venus as the evil inclinations of\nSaturn and Mars. How thefe circum\nftances operatebeyondtheequinoc\u00ad\ntial experience is yet filent; but it feem\ns reafonable to fuppofe that the\nDragon\u2019s Tail is there the fruitful point, and the H\nead the barren point,\nfince, when the Moonis going offfromus, her influences mult becoming\non with them\n.\nNext\n\fl 6 2 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nNext to the nodes, the part o f fortune has its operations upon thefe\ntwelve celeftial houfes. The point, which we term the part of fortune,\nis the diftancc of the Moon\u2019s place fromthe Sun\u2019s, added to the degreesi\nof the afcendant; and the nature of it is, a\ns conftant obfervation aficer-J\nt^ins, that, if this point falls am\nong fortunate ftars, orin afortunate parr\nof the heavens, then it prom\nifes great fuccefs in health or wealth, honour\nor offspring, or anyother fpecies of profperitv, according a\ns it isTeated\neither in the firft, eleventh, or fifth, houfes, or in any others. The rea-\nfon of this appears^to be, that the Sun, Moon, and Afcendant, being the\nprim\ne conduits through which the itreamof life flows, this feat of the\npart of fortune is the harm\nony of all three concentring and uniting in\nthe fam\ne ads of benevolence.\nNow, befides thefe, there are yet other qualities, accidentally affefied,\nwhich concern either particular perfons or tim\nes. Thus, the places of\nSaturn, or M\nars, orthe Tail of the Dragon, in the vernal figure, are un\u00ad\nfortunate inthe higheft degree for the whole of that year; or, if they\nhappen in any of the quarter figures, they portend affliction and mif*\nfortune for that quarter. But the places of Jupiter and Venus in a ver\u00ad\nnal figure are a\ns fortunate a\ns the others areunfortunate for thefam\netime.\nThe places of an eclipl'eof the Sunor Moon, an\nd of thecomets, arc alfo\nfortunate o\nr unfortunate, as their iituation m\nay be, or a\ns perfons, coun\u00ad\ntries, or ftates, m\nay be concerned in them\n. The place of Saturnor M\nars\nin a m\nan\u2019s nativity proves unfortunate to him all thedays of his life; and\nthe place of citherof them in a revolutional figure isequally bad for that\nyear. But the placeof Jupiter or Venus in a nativity, or in a revolu- ,\ntional figure, is always a\ns fortunate, either for a m\nan\u2019s life-time, or for\nthe year, as the other is unfortunate. Alfo the places of the twelfth\nhouie, oreighth, or fixth, a\ns they w\nereinthe nativefchem\ne, have always\nbad fignifications unto am\nan, whenfoever they com\ne up upon any of his\nconcerns. And the places of the tenth.houie, of the eleventh, of the\nafcendant, and of the fecond boufe, generally prom\nife as m\nuch good as\nthe other houfes do evil upon all thecom\nm\non occafions of life.\nThus far we have feen the operations of the twelve houfes of heaven,\na\ns they appertain tothe tim\ne andcircum\nflances of a nativity. We ihaH\nnow explain their properties in that fyflem of nature upon which the\ndodtrineof horary queftions is grounded.

The colour it gives is green.\nFrom the foregoing circumftantial furvey of the twelve houfes of hea\u00ad\nven, I truft the reader will be enabled to form fuch an idea of the nature\nof predicting by the horofcope, as will enable him not only to proceed to\nplace the flars and planets therein with corre&nefs and precifion, but alfo\nto form an accurate and diftind judgment of their power and influence,\nunder whatever afpeCts or pofltions he may occaflonally find them ; for,\nuntil he can accompliih this, it will be in vain for him to attempt any\nexamples in the doftrine of horary queftions or nativities, which will be\nthe next objeCl of our plan, after explaining the tables for finding the\nplaces of the planets every hour and minute of the day, and directing the\nreader how to place them in the horofcope. But I cannot difmifs this\nfubjeft, without giving my readers the definition of the twelve houfes of\nheaven, from the works of the learned and much-efteemed philofopherand\naftrologian, Morinus ; and in doing this, I fhall adhere as much to the\nfpirit and letter of the author as the nature of a tranflation will admit.\n\" It is a fad, fays this excellent author, which preponderates in the ba\u00ad\nlance of reafon, and highly claims our fober confederation, that the life of\nman is refolvable into four diftind periods or ages 5 namely, infancy,\nyouth, maturity, and old age; though it may be faid with ftrid truth,\nthat fcarce half the human race attain to the conclufion of only their third\nperiod. In the conftruclion of man, therefore, we difeover four affedions,\ninto which all other things appear to be reducible, as it were to their firft\nbeginning; namely, life, adion, marriage, andpaffion. Thefe agree with\nthe rife, perfedion, declination, and termination of all things, and com-\nprife the whole effeds and operations of nature. For man is truly faid\nto rife into the world, the moment he receives refpiration and life; to be\nin perfection, when he attains to manhood and maturity, and to the pro\u00ad\npagation of his fpecits ; to decline, when he begins to lofe the innate\nradical principle of heat and moifture ; and to fuftain the laft paifion of\nlife, when he ccafes to breathe, and filcntly finks into the grave.. The\nlife, adion, marriage, and paifions, of men, are therefore governed by the\nfame celeftial principle, which regulates the birth, perfection, declinati\u00ad\non, and diflolution, of all other things. Wherefore life, in the fyftetn\nof nature, is regulated by the eaft angle of the heavens, called the afeen-\ndant; action, by the fouth angle, or mid-heaven; marriage, by the weft\nangle; andpafflon, by the north angle of the heavenly frame. And hence\nNo. 8. P p arile\n\f16\u00ab A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\narife four triplicities of the fame genus or generical nature, and twelve\nhoufes, as heretofore defcribed. The firft triplicity is of the eaftern an\u00ad\ngle, or afcendant, attributed to infancy, and called the triplicity of life,\nand includes the firft, ninth, and fifth, boofes, which behold each other\nin a partile trine in the equator, where this rational divihon of the twelve\nhoules is made.\n99 Man either does or ought to live in a three-fold refpefi, in himfelf,\nin God, and in his pofterity ; for the great ends for which lie was created,\nare toworfhip and glorify his Maker, and to propagate his fpecies. Thelife\nof man in himfelf is therefore the firft and prime obje\u00a3i in the order of\nnature ; for without this all other parts of the creation would be vain,\nbeing madefor mans ufe and benefit. For this caufe, the life of man ap\u00ad\npertains to the firft and principal houfe in the divifion of the heavens.\nBut man's life in God, confiding in his image of the Divinity, in the ra\u00ad\ntionality of his foul, and in the purity of his morals, claims, for this rea-\nfon, the ninth houfe, according to the motion of the equator, which is\nthe houfe of piety and religion. And, as man\u2019s life is continued in his\npofterity, according to one and the fame unchangeable law prefiding over\nall nature, fo the houfe of infancy and children, which is the fifth houfe,\nis appropriated for this purpofe. And thefe three concerns being con-\nfefledly the grand objeft of man\u2019s life, the three houfes of heaven, under\nwhich they are refpettively nourilhedand foftcred, form a trine with each\nother, in a chain of mutual harmony and concord.\n4t The fecond triplicity confifts of the angle of the mid-heaven, with\nthe fixth and fecond houfes. This triplicity wholly appertains to the\nfecond ftageof man\u2019s life, namely, that of vigour anda&ion; and there\u00ad\nfore comprehends all worldly attainments, with the advantages flowing\nfrom them ; for every thing that worketh phyfically, worketh for fome\nphyfical good ; and, as the motion of the equator is from the eaft angle to\nthe mid-heaven, fo is the progrefs made in all our earthly acquifitions.\nThe higheft degree of man\u2019s elevation in this world is to that of majefty,\npower, honour, dignity, preferment, or magiftracy, or to any of thofe fi-\ntuations by which he acquires fuperiority and affluence. Thefe, confift-\ning of immaterial matter, and forming the firft order of earthly dignity,\nclaim the angular houfe of this triplicity, or the mid-heaven. The fe\u00ad\ncond degree of worldly honour is conceived to arife from fubjedls, fer-\nvants, tenants, vaffals, and domeftics ; and tbefe, being formed of mat\u00ad\nter material and animated, are placed under the fixth houfe. The third\nadvancement to earthly grandeur is by matter material and animate, fuch\nas gold, jewels, and other valuable effects, accumulated by induftry and\nfwcat ofthe brow * which being under the fecond houfe, thefe three houfes\nare\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 169\nare alfo joined by fympathy in a partile trine, applying to each otbej; in\nconcord and unanimity. '\n\u00ab\n\u00ab The third triplicity comprehends worldly connections, whether by\nmarriage, confanguinity, or friendihip ; and thefe, holding on in the or\u00ab\nder of nature, even as the progrefs is made from the mid-heaven to the\nweitern angle, apply to the progreilive tendency of youth to manhood and\nmaturity. In this itage of life, man is joined in a three-fold tie or obli\u00ad\ngation ; in body, in blood, and in friendihip. Firft,bci$jQined in body,\nby the moil facred o f all earthly ties, matrimony j faQ&iqQfid under the\nfeat of God\u2019s primary command, \u201c increafe and multiply.\u201d Secondly, he\nis joined in confanguinity, not only by the propagation of his like, but\nby all orders of his kindred in blood. Thirdly, he is joioed in friend\u00ad\nihip under that facred bond of benevolence and love, which the Almighty\ncommands every man to exercife towards his neighbour. This is the\nvery cement of fociety, and medicine of life, performing thofp good offi\u00ad\nces in civil life, which the tree pf life promifed in our more perfect ftate,\nand thefe are the fentiments of friendship, which alone can give a true\nrelifh to every enjoyment of this world. The moft important of thefe\nobligations, being marriage, is for that reafon placed under fan&ion of the\nangular or fuperior houfe j the fecond tie, being that or blood, claims the\ngovernment of the third houfe i and the eleventh houfe, which perfects\nthis triplicity, is facred to friendihip. Thefe three houfes, from an\nunion of nature, behold each other in a partile trine, according to the mo\u00ad\ntion of the equator.\n\u201c The fourth and laft triplicity is that of paffion, which comprehends\nthe three clades of human afflictions. The firft, or angular houfe of this\ntriplicity, in allulion to its portion in the lower horizon, is termed the\ndark angle, the depth of night, and bottom of heaven t the den and cave\nof the ftars and planets. To this houfe is committed the firft order of our\nwoes, agreeable to the courfe of nature : thefe are, infupportable mis\u00ad\nfortunes, and vihble decline of lifej the firil confequences of original\nfin, by which man is devoted to corruption and decay, and to all the infir\u00ad\nmities of nature. The fecond order of human afflictions is tribulation,\nforrow, and difeafe ariling either from the treachery and perfection of\nenemies, from the chains of fervitude and bondage, or from poverty and\nwant: thefe, with a long train of confequent naileries, are appropriated to\nthe twelfth houfe. The laft fhock that can be luftained by human na\u00ad\nture, is death, the final end of all men: this is under government of\nthe eighth houfe, termed, on this account, the houfe of death. And\nthefe houfes likewife, from the conformity of thetr nature and qualities,\nconftitute a partile trine in the equator.\n** Thus\n\fi;o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n4\n' \u201c Thus the termination of this temporal life is the beginning of life\neternal. For nature knows no annihilation. All the works of Omnipo\u00ad\ntence are refolvable or changeable from one ftate to another j but God,\nhaving created nothing in vain, fuffers nothing :o be annulled.

And therefore, whatever is \u00f1rft in\ndignity in the order of nature, pofiefies the firft and more noble houfesin\nthefe triplicities, in regular fubordination, according to the motion of the\necliptic and planets.\n** And now, what man is he, who, confiding in the ftrength of his\nown wifdom, will dare to meafure the works of his C R E A T O R by the\nftandard of his own comprehenfion ? or will venture to affirm, that thefe\noperations and divifions of the twelve celeftial houfes, conjoined with\nfuch wonderful harmony, contrivance, and concord, are the efteds of\nchance or accident; or that will fay, fuch admirable confents, foexcellently\nformed, and mutually dependant on each other, are cafually found in\nthings fo complicated and abftrufe ?

This acquifition, therefore, is the\nnext ftep to be attained ; and, though it mayatfirft appear a talk of fome\ndifficulty and labour, yet, by the help of a common Ephemeris, which is\npubliihed annually, and the following tables, which are calculated and\nfubjoined for this purpofe, the reader may in a few hours become perfect\nmailer of this very effential part of the fcience.\nThe Ephemeris, of which Mr. White\u2019s is the beft, is calculated to\nihew the exact places of the Sun, Moon, and planets, every day at twelve\no\u2019clock ; confequently, by referring to it, a figure may be accurately fet\nto that exact time. But it may feldom or ever happen, that a figure is\nwanted precifely at that hour, and therefore it is neceffary the young prac\u00ad\ntitioner ihould know how to rectify the daily motions of the planets, by\nthe number of degrees they move every twenty-four hours, fo as to erect\nthe figure, and introduce the true places of the figns and planets, when\u00ad\never required. This, by referring to the Ephemeris for the ilations of\nthe planets at noon, may be done extremely eafy, by the common pro-\ncefs of figures ; but, that every reader may be enabled to do it without\ntrouble, } have fubjoined an eafy table, whereby the planetary motions\nare reduced to hours and minutes, and may be found for either day or\nnight.\nIt is likewife of importance to know the planetary hours, that is, the\nhour in which every planet has its particular rule $ for hereby we are\nenabled to determine various points, and to draw many ufeful conclu-*\nfions, either in our judgment on nativities or horary queftions. In ga\u00ad\nthering herbs for medicinal purpofes,' the planetary hour is certainly\nof confequence, however modern refinement might have exploded\n\u2022the idea. In nature, the moil fimple remedies are frequently found to\nproduce the moil falutary effects ; and in earlier times, when the art of\nphyfic was lefs obfeured, and practifed more from motives of benevo\u00ad\nlence, the world was lefs afflicted with difeafe, and the period of hu\u00ad\nman life lefs contracted.

Each planet begins his rule the moment the Sun\nappears above the horizon, and continues for one planetary hour* at the\nexpiration of which the nextplanet in order commences his rule, and con-\ntinuesthe fame portion of time, and then the third planet in order governs,\nand fo on through the whole week. So that, if I wanttoknow what planet\nrules in any particular hourof the day or night, I take the planet which be\u00ad\ngins rule that day, and reckon in order till I find it. For example On Sun\u00ad\nday the Sun rules the firft hour, Venus the fecond, Mercury the third, the\nMoon the fourth, Saturn the fifth, Jupiter the fixth, Mars the l'eventh,\nthe Sun the eighth, Venus the ninth, and fo on through the whole day\nand fucceeding night, till the Sun rifes again ; by which mode of reckon\u00ad\ning it will be uniformly found, that each planet will begin his govern\u00ad\nment at Sun rifing, according to the order above deferibed, to the end\nof the world. This alfo evidently appears by the table: for, if we begin\nwith the firft column, and reckon down the whole twenty-four hours,\nwe find the Moon begins hisgovernment at the top of the fecond column\non Monday morning, when the fun riles. If we reckon down the fecond\ncolumn, in the fame order, we find Mars begins his rule at the top of\nthe third column, on Tuefday morning. So the planets will be found\nto obferve the fame regular order throughout all the other columns,\nwhich take in the hours of every day and night throughout the week j\nand for the enfuing week the table begins again in the fame order, and\nwill fo continue without alteration or error, to the end of time.

For example, fuppofe I want to know what planet rules the\nfifth hour on Sunday morning; I look down the firll colum of the\ntable, over which is placed Sunday planetary hour, and at the 5th hour\nI find Saturn governs. Again, fuppofe it be required to know what pla\u00ad\nnet governs the ninth hour on Friday afternoon : Look down the column\nover which Friday planetary hour is printed, and in the 9th hour it will\nbe feen that Mercury governs. Or if it beaiked, what planet rules the\nnineteenth hour on Wednefday night ? Look down the column over which\nWednefday planetary hour is prefixed, and at 19, which fignifies the\n19th hour, or the feventh hour after the Sun is fet, it will be found that\nMars governs ; and fo for any other time required.\nBut a planetary hour not agreeing with the common divifion of time,\nand being peculiar to aftronomy and aftrology only, we (hall explain it\nmore fully. The planetary hours are reckoned from the time of the Sun\u2019s\nrifing to its fetting, which fpace of time is divided into twelve equal parts,\nand thefe are termed the twelve planetary hours of that day. Then the\ntime from the Sun\u2019s fetting to its rifing the next morning, is in the fame\nmanner divided into twelve equal parts, and thefe conftitutc the twelve\nplanetary hours for that night. Hence it is obvious, that when the\ndays are ihort, a planetary hour does not conliftof above forty minutes,\nmore or lcfs, according to the twelfth part of the whole time from the\nSun\u2019s rifing to its fetting j and the nights being then long, a planetary\nhour by night may confift of an hour and ten or twenty minutes, or more $\nand fo vice verfa, when the days are long, and the nights ihort, fo that the\nduration of planetary hours, both by day and night, are continually varying,\nand never agree with the common meafure of time, except on thofe two\ndays in every year when the Sun enters Aries and Libra, and then equal\nnight and day are difpenfed to allparts of the world. Therefore, to enable\nthe reader to find the length of the planetary hours without the trouble\nof calculating, I fubjoin the following table, by which they may be found\nboth night and day for ever.\nTABLE\n\fO P A S T R O L O G Y . 175\nT A B L E of the P L A N E T A R Y H O U R S for every D a y and\nN ight inthe W\neek.\nL cngth of the\nDay.\nLength of the Plane\u00ad\ntary Hours by Day.\nLength of the Plane\u00ad\ntary Hours by Night.\nH.

But, fince no information can be obtained in the\npractical part of this fcience without them, it is proper to caution all my\nreaders againft this much-miftaken notion ; for every perfonwhocan make\nufe of a Ready Reckoner, or Trader s Sure Guide%may with equal cafe un-\nderihnd all the tables calculated for this work.\nThe ufe of the Ephemeris, in fetting afigure, is to point out the places\nof the planets at noon, whenever required. For this purpofe, we refer\nto the given day of the month, in the firil column of the right-hand page,\nand oppofite to it, in the ilcond column, is the Sun\u2019s place or longitude\nthat day ct noon. So alio, in the lame line of the fucceeding columns\nthrough the whole table, are the places of the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter,\nMars, Venus, and Mercury, as fpecified at the top of tach diftinCi co\u00ad\nlumn ; and rhefe are the true places of the Sun, Moon, and planets,\nevery day throughout the year, precifely at twelve o\u2019clock at noon.\nThereiore, if the figure be erected before that time, the diurnal motion\nof the planets muft be deducted in hours and minutes, in proportion to\nthe rate they move at per hour; but, if it be ere\u2018ted alter i oun, then fo\nmany hours or minutes muft be added as will bring them to the precife\ntime of erecting the figure.\nThe twelve tables ofHoufes are next to be referred to } and thefe are\ncalculated to ihew what degrees of each fign poiTefs the cufps of the\ntwelve houfts of heaven when the figure is ertdted. They begin with\nthe Sun\u2019s entrance into the fign Aries, and ihew his progrefs through\neach degree of the twelve figns of the zodiac.\nNow let it be required, by way ofexample, to erefl a figure* for Fri\u00ad\nday, the nth day of June, 1784, at 11 h. 24 min. A. M. that is, at\ntwenty-four minutes paft eleven o\u2019clock in the morning. To do this, I\nrefer to the firft column of the right-hand page of the Ephemeris for\nJune, and oppofite the 11th day of the month, in the fecond column,\nwhich has o \u2019s longitude printed at the top, I find 21. 3. 27, with the\nfign n prefixed at the fide of the firft range of figures. This indicates,\nthat the Sun, at twelve o\u2019clock that day, is in twenty-one degrees three\nminutes and twenty-feven fcconds of Gemini; but the minutes and\nfeconds, when leis than thirty, are rejeited without fenfible error, and,\nwhen more than thirty, have as many added as will make them up even\ndegrees. I therefore turn to the tables of houfes, and in the page enti\u00ad\ntled Sol in Gemini I look for the column that has the fign n at the\ntop, which is the third; 1 feek for 21 degrees, and in the column on\nthe\n\fO F A S t R O L O G Y . i93\nthe left fide of it, entitled Tim\nefromn\no\no\nn\n, I find, even with 21 degrees,\n5I1. 21 tnin. The hours and minutes thus found are uniformly to be\nadded to the time or hour of the day when the figure is erected, un-\nlefs it be precifely at noon, in which cafe, as we have before obferved,\nthe places of the Sun, planets, and iigns, are to be fet down exactly as\nthey are found in the Epheifteris, and tables of houfes. But, the pre-\nfent figure being eredlcd juft thirty-fix minutes before twelve o\u2019clock, I\nam to add this time, reckoning from noon the preceding day, to the\nabove 5h. 21 min. and from thefe two fums added together I fubtradt\ntwenty-four houts, and the remainder will give the degrees of each of the\ntwelve iigns, as then pofited uponthe cufps of the horofeope ; thus ;\nh. min.\nTime anfvveringto 21 degrees of n 5 21\nTime from noon the preceding day 23 24\nAdded together, make 28 45\nSubtradt 24 O\nRemainder 4 45\nI feek this remainder in the table of houfes entitled Sol in Gemini, in\nthe column of timefrom noon ; but, not finding 4. 45, I take the neareft\nnumber to it, which is 4. 46 ; and oppofite this number, in the next\ncolumn on the right, I find 13 degrees of Gemini in the tenth houfe,\nwhich is denoted by 10th houfe n, at the top of the column ; and there\u00ad\nfore I place thirteen degrees of Gemini in the line or cufp of the tenth\nhoufe of the figure. This done, I refer to the next cpluinn in rotation\nto the right hand, and in the fame line with the degrees of\nGemini I find 20. 7, and, looking to the top of the column, find it to\nbe twenty degrees and feven minutes of the fign 25, with n houfe over,\nand therefore I place twenty degrees feven minutes of Cancer upon the\ncuip of the eleventh houfe. I follow the fame rule with the next co\u00ad\nlumn, where I find 21.^8, and looking to the top find the fign s i, 12\nhoufe, and accordingly place twenty one degrees thirty-eight minutes\nof Leo upon the cufp of the twelfth noufe in the figure. Then I refer\nto the next column, where I find 17. 1, and at th^ top the word jifeen -\n\u00bfant with the fign n. prefixed, which fignifies rhat lcventeen degrees one\nminute of Virgo occupy the firft houfeor All aidant, which I place ac\u00ad\ncordingly. I then refer to the next column, and even with the preced\u00ad\ning figures ftand 9. 15, when, looking up the column, I obferve the\nfign below m\nt, and 2 houfe at the top, which fhews that nine degrees\nfifteen minutes of Libra are to be placed on the cuip of thefecond houfe.\nThis done, 1 refer to the laft column, and, even with the former num-\n2 bers\n\f194 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nbers, I find 7. 48; and, lookingup thecolumn as before, I obferve the\nfign ni below and 3 houfe over, which indicates that (even degrees\nforty-eightminutes of Scorpioareto beplaced on the cufp of the third\nhoufe. Thus the fix oriental houfes, namely, the tenth, eleventh, twelfth,\nfirft, fecond, and third, are furniihed with the degrees of each fign then\nriling upon them ; and the fix occidental houfes, being oppofite to the\nformer! are always furniihed with the fame degrees and minutes of the\noppofite figns; thus:\nHoufes oppofite. Signs oppofite.\n4 10 P\nT\n5 11 b n\ni\n6 12 n t\n1 7 ' s\ns y*\n2 8 a\n3 9 n\n* X\nSo that the tenth houfe is oppofite to the fourth, and the fourth to\nthe tenth ; the eleventh to the fifth, and the fifth to the eleventh ; and\nfo through the whole ; the ufe of which is, that, if on the cufp of the\ntenth houfe you find the fign Aries, then on the cufp of the fourth houfe\nyou muft place the fign Libra ; and, whatever degree and minute of Aries\npoffefles the cufp of the tenth houfe, the fame degree andminute of Li\u00ad\nbramuft be placed on the cufp of the fourth ^houfe; and the fame rule\nmuft beobferved with all the other houfes and figns, which is univerfal\nand ever holds true. For example, in the prefent figure, we have placed\n13 degrees of n on the cufp of the tenth houfe ; now t being oppofite\nto n, andthe fourth houfe to the tenth, I therefore place 13 degrees of\nt on the cufp of the fourth houfe. Upon the cufp of the eleventh\nhoufe, 20 degrees 7 minutes of Cancer being already placed, and the\nfifth houfe being oppofite to the eleventh, and v? oppofite \u00a9, I there\u00ad\nfore put 20 degrees 7 minutes of y? upon the cufp of the fifth houfe.\nThe cufp of the twelfth houfe being alfo occupied with 21 degrees 38\nminutes of a, I place 21 degrees 38 minutes of the oppofite fign sz\nupon the cufp of the fixth houfe, which is oppofite the twelfth. Upon\nthe cufp of the firft houfe, or afeendant, there is in degrees 1 minuteof\n15, and thefeventh houfe being oppofite to the firft, and the fign x to\nI accordingly place 17 degrees 1 minute of x upon the cufp or line\nof the feventh houfe. Having alfo placed 9 degrees 15 minutes of\nupon thecufp of the fecond houfe, I place 9 degrees 15 minutes\"of the\noppofite fign r upon the cufp of theeighth houfe, which is oppofite to\nthe fecond. I then refer to the third houfe, upon the cufp of which are\nplaced 7 degrees 48 minutes of nu and the oppofite houfe to this being\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y , i95\nthe ninth, and \u00ab the oppofite fign, I place 7 degrees 48 minutes of\n.Taurus, upon the cufp of the ninth houfe ; and thus the twelve houfes\nare.comp!eatly occupied with the twelve figns of the zodiac, with the de\u00ad\ngrees afeending, at the precife time of erecting the figure.\nHaving fo far fucceeded, the next thing is toplacethe Sun, Moon, and\nplanets in the figure, agreeable to their pofition atthat timein the heavfcns,\nand this is alfoto be done by the helpof the right-hand page of the Ephe-\nmeris. For inftarice, I again refer to the nth of June, and oppofite\nto it, in the column of the o \u2019s longitude, I find him in 21 degrees 3\nminutes and 27 feconds of Gemini that day at noon. But, as the figure is\neredled thirty-fix minutes before noon, I notehow far theSunhas moved\nfrom noon the preceding day, and find he has gone at the rate of fifty-\nfeven minutes, which gives a difference of one minuteand twenty-feven\nfeconds for the time before noon, as follows :\nmin. fee.\nSun\u2019s place at noon, June 1ith 21 3 27\nDedudt for 36 min. before noon o 1 27\nRemains 21 2 o\nThus I find the Sun\u2019s placeat twenty-four minutesafter eleveno'clock,\nin 21 degrees 2 minutesof Gemini; which fign being then upon the cufp\nof the tenth houfe, I therefore place the Sun in that houfe, clofe to the\nfign, with thefe degrees and minutes, I then refer to the Ephemeris f or\nthe Moon\u2019s place, and in the column of her longitude, oppofite the 11th\nday of themonth, I find her in 5degrees 46 minutes of nr, at noon ; but,\nto know her place thirty-fix minutes before, I note how much ihe goes\nin an hour, and find her motion to be 35 minutes; then I deduct 21 mi\u00ad\nnutes for the time before noon, and find her true place to be in 5 hours\n25 minutes of Aries, which I accordingly enter before the cufp of the\neighth houfe, clofe to that fign. I then refer to the Ephemeris for the\nplanet J\n?, arid on the nth of June I find him retrograde in 22 degrees\n53 minutes of the fign Vf, wherefore I place him under Capricorn, in the\nfifth houfe, with an R prefixed, to denpte that he is retrograde\u2014I refer\nto the Ephemeris in like manner for the planets Jupiter, Mars, Venus,\nand Mercury, which I alfo enter in their proper places in thefigure, viz.\nJupiter in 7 degrees 36 minutes of x , Mars in 27 degrees 1 minute of\na, Venus in 5 degrees 5 minutes of u, and Mercury retrograde, in 24\ndegrees 2minutes of the fame fign.\nThe planets being thus entered, I next refer to the top of the fecond\npage of the Ephemeris, for the column of the Moon's node, which we\nterm the Dragon's Head, and I find on the 7th day of the month it is\nNo. 10. Y y in\n\fx96 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nin four degrees of Pifces; but, as it moves backwardabout threeminutes\nper day, I dtduft eleven minutes, to bring it to the nth of June, and\nits place will then be in four degrees 8 minutes of Pifces; I therefore\nenter it in the fixth houfe, under the fign x ; and, as the place of the\nDragon's Tail is always oppofite to the Dragon's Head, I place it in the\nfame degrees of the oppofite fign, which in this figurefalls in the twelfth\nhoufe, which is oppofite to the fixth.\nThe figure is now entirely compleated, except putting in the Part of\nFortune, which is the diftance of the Moon's place fromthe ftun's added\nto nfrftadont. The mode 0\/ determining this has commonly beenby\nfiril finding the true place of the Moon, then the true place of the Sun;\nthen lubtracting the Sun's place from the Moon's and adding to the re\u00ad\nmainder the degrees of the afeendant; and this, if taken in the fphere of\nthe Moon, gives the place of the Part of Fortune. But, a much more\ncorreft method having been adopted by the learned Placidus> we recom\u00ad\nmend it inpreference toany other; it is as follows : Firit note the fign\nand degree on the afeendant, and enter with the fame fign and degree in\nthe table of oblique afeenfions calculated for this work, in the latitude\nwherein you erectyour figure; and in the common angle of meeting you\nwill find the number required. Then enter the fame table with the de-\ngreeof the Sun, and fubtrad: the oblique afeenfion of the one from the\nother, and the remainder will be the Sun's diftance from theJ afeendant.\nThen take the Right Afeenfion of the Moon, and enter the table of the\nMoon's Right Afeenfion under the degrees of north or fouth latitude, as\n\u00a3\nhe then happens to be ; and, when the Moon's Right Afeenfion isfound,\nfubtrad it from the Sun's diftancefromthe Afeendant, andthe remainder\nwill be the Right Afeenfion of the Part of Fortune, For example, in\nthe figure before us : deg. min.\nThe fign m has 17 deg. 1 min. upon the Afeen\u00ad\ndant, the oblique Afeenfion of which is 161 33\nThe oblique Afeenfion of the G (both being in\nnorthern figns, nothing is added) is 47\nWhich being fubtrafled from the other, remains 113\nT hen fubtratt the Right Afeenfion of the Moon, 2\n43\n50\n52\nRemains m 58\nWhich is the Right Afeenfion of the Part of Fortune.

For example, fuppofe a perfon born\nin fifty-three degrees of latitude, on the firft of June, 1784, at thirty-\nfix minutes part five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, what would be tue de\u00ad\ngrees of each fign upon the cufps of the twelve houfes ? to know this,\nturn to the Ephemeris for the Sun\u2019s place on the firft of June, and it\nwill be found in eleven degrees thirty minutes of Gemini; then refer to\nthe table oi houfes for the Sun in Gemini, and in the column under\nlotn hcule, I look downfor 11. 30, but, finding no minutes, I look into\nthe column upon the left hand, under time from noon, where I find\n4 h. 38 min. the next arch of time being 4 b. 42 minutes, I divide\nthe difference for the thirty minutes, which makes the true time 4 h, 40\nmin. To this I add 5I1. 36 min. the time after noon, which added to\u00ad\ngether make 10 h. 16 min. which I feck in the column of time from\nnoon, and in the next column on the right hand I find the figure 2,\nwith 10 houfe m at the top, which denotes that two degrees or Virgo\narc at that time upon the cufp of the tenth houle. Then, in order to\nknow what figns poffefs the other houfes, I look into the firft column of\nthe table, with A.

To thefe 154 degrees I\nadd 30, which make together 184; then I refer to the above table for\npoles pofition in fifty-three degrees, and even therewith lland 24. 40.\nwhich is the pole of the eleventh houfe. I then refer to the table of\noblique afeenfions, at the end of this woik, for twenty-five degree* of la\u00ad\ntitude, and feck the number 184, which I find in the column under Li\u00ad\nbra, and12 min. over; then 1 look into the firft column of degrees in this\ntable, and even to 184 itand 4; but thcic twelve minutes being too\nmuch, I equate for themby the Sexagenary tables, placed alfo at the end\nof this work, by which I find that three degrees forty-three minutes of\nLibra are to be placed onthecufpoftheeleventhhouie.

Then, for the firft houfe or alcendant,\nI add to the above 214 thirty degrees more, which make 244, and this\niumI feek in the above table under the pole or latitude of birth, which\nis fifty-three degrees ; I turn to the table of oblique alcenfions for fifty-\nthree degrees, which I find in the column under Scorpio, and even with\nit in the firft column of degrees I find 14, which (hews that fourteen\ndegrees of Scorpio are on the cufp of the afeendant.

But, to make it more eafy,.\nit is neceflary to explain what we mean by the poles pofitions, and the\nequations of time. If we imagine twelve great circles, one of which i&\nthe meridian of any given place, to interlefi each other in the two poles\nof the earth, and to cut the equator in every fifteenth degree, they will be\ndivided by the poles into twenty-four femicircles, which divide the equator\ninto twenty-four equal parts; and as the earth turns on its axis, the planes\nof thefe femicircles come fucceflively after one another every hour to the\nfun. And, as in an hour of time there is a revolution of fifteen degrees\nof the equator, in a minute of time there will be a revolution of fifteen\nminutes of the equator, and in a fecond of time a revolution of fifteen\nfeconds. Thus, to every place fifteen degrees eaflward from any given\nmeridian, it is noon an hour looner than on that meridian, becaufe their\nmeridian comes to the Sun an hour fooner. And to all places fifteen de\u00ad\ngrees weftward, it is an hour later, becaufe their meridian comes an hour\nlater to the Sun ; and fo on, every fifteen degrees of motion caufing an\nhour\u2019s difference of time.

The fignifications\nof the part of fortune, beingdirected in like manner, are altogether the\nfame with what we hintedin the directions of the fecond houfe.\nIn all thefe directions we muft havegreat regardboth to the fignand the\nTioufe. In directions which concern the body, we have refpedt to the-fign,\nbecaufe that mod commonly indicates the part afflicted ; fo alfo does the\nhoule ; for, if the direction falls in theafeendant, the affliction falls in the\nhead, as onthe eyes, nofe, ears, or brain ; if in the fecond, in thethroat,\n&c. In directions which concern the eftate, honour, or fortune, we\nchiefly take noticeof the houfe, for that indicatesthe m\neans by which the\n\u2022thing ihall be attained ; the nature of the ftar, the quality of theperfon;\nif in the third, by a kinfnun, or by travel; if in the feventh, by a wife,\nor woman.\nIn direfting any planet to thefe fixed ftars, confider whether the ftar\nfympathizes with the fignificator in natureandquality, ornot; if it does,\nthe directionmay begood, although it be toanevil ftar; for fweet to fweet\nis fweet; like tolike breeds nodifeord ; anunionandagreement ofnatures\ntakes away the evil effects ; for, if thelord of the afeendant was Saturn,\nand he ihould be directed to Cauda Leonis, aftar of his own nature, this\ncould be no evil direction, nor any way afflitt the native either in body\nor eftate; but would have famous andgloriouseffetis, both for healthand\nwealth, according to the place it falls in. In thefe directions we are\nprincipally to regard the magnitude of the ftar; for ftars only of the firft\nmagnitudeprefage things eminently glorious or dangeroufly deftructive;\nand thofe which are of the fecond come very near them. Then the place\nof the direction is to be noted ; for, if it falls in an angle, the direction\nwill not only be famousand eminent, but alfo manifeft itfelf with agreat\ndeal of life and vigour, and that ona fudden ; in afuccedent houfe, the\neffects will be more languid ; in a cadent, notonly weak fcndflow, but it\nmay be a queftion whether they will ever operate at all.

Sol or Luna in quartile or oppofition to\nSaturn or Mars frpm angles, chiefly the medium cceli, (hews a violent\ndeath; if to Mars only, and in humane figns, the native will beflain by\nthe hands of his enemies ; if to Saturn, he will either havea great fall,\nbe imprifoned, or itarved to death in a prifon. Sol and Luna amifted in\nwatery or airy figns the native greatlywith the gout.

Sol and Mercury in conjunction in the third or\nfourth makes the perfon ikilful in occult arts and fciences.

If he be only peregrine, he is meanly affedted as to\ngliod or evil, viz. neither effentially ftrong nor weak; if in his fall, he\n\/flags in bis motion, and is a man indifpofed and uneafy. Therefore a\nplanet in his fall or detriment effcdts no good to the native, if any, it is\ndepraved, and consequently dangerous or pernicious.\n3 S\nNo. 14. Apia*\n\f272 a n i l l u s t r a t i o n\nA planet diredt and fwift in motion, or on the contrary, is as thofe very\nterms import ; therefore their celerity, orientality, and their pofition, if\nfuperiors, fupra terram, makes them more manifeft and powerful. Aries\naicending gives martial wit and inclination, but, if the Sun be in par\u00ad\ntile, trine, or fclmfe', to it, or its lord, or in conjunction of Jupiter, who\nmay be in platic fextile or trine to either of them, then it is made fol\u00e2i\nand jovial, but chiefly iplar. Underftand the like in other figns afcend-\ning, according to their refpe\u00e9tive nature, and the nature alfo of thofe pla\u00ad\nnets that behold them.\nThe nature and ftatc of every planet muft be attended to ; for a pla\u00ad\nnet may be confidered in relation to the portents or lignification of any\nfign or manfion of heaven ; thus, Firft as to pofition; f\u00e9cond, dominion;\nthird, exaltation; fourth, afpe\u00e9t ; fifth, oppofition thereunto; as for ex\u00ad\nample, Saturn in Aries muil be confidered as Martialized and Solalized,\nbecaufe Aries is the houfe of Mars, and the exaltation and triplicity of\nthe Sun, and lb in others. The afeendant in any nativity is to be ob-\nferved, alio the lord of the afeendant and his pofition, or a planet pofited\ntherein ; all which are to be confidered by the reader or ftudent as to the\nportents or lignification of the afeendant. The fixth houfe lignifies dif-\neafes, but yet the twelfth Iball be a configurator in all corporal afflic\u00ad\ntions, as being in oppofition thereto.\nFrom the lord of the afeendant, or any other houfe, proceeds the chief\nvirtue or moft powerful part as to the lignification of that houfe; if Sa\u00ad\nturn and the Sun be in conjunction in Leo in the tenth houfe, the latter\nbeing neareft to the cufp thereof, then the native arrives to lome, deg\/Ccf\nof dignity or honour from the analogy, pofition, dominion, or-f\u00e9rtitude,\nof the Sun, as alfo his propinquity to the cufp. But Satufn being of a\ncontrary nature, and adverfe to what the Sun portends, alfo hating the\nplace of his refidence, and partly afflidting the Sun, wiiiTl^rcfofe^trf^.\nlome unhappy misfortune to arile, and cloud the glory promised by the\nSun in the end. Saturn in conjunction with Jupiter in Virgo is moft\npowerful, and overcomes in his efFecls ; but, if they are conjoined in\nAries, then Jupiter is ftrongeft, and becomes vi\u00e2or. This reciprocally\nby each being in his fall.\nThe luminaries are to be confidered as more powerfuTand fignificVnt\nthan the reft of the planets; and therefore any of the fuperiors in conjunc\u00ad\ntion with the Sun in Leo influences much power and honour to the na-'\ntive by virtue of the Sun, &c. So if Saturn be in conjundion with Ju\u00ad\npiter in Sagittary, the houfe of Jupiter, then Saturn ads in d\u00e9pendance\nto his difpofitor. Any planet ftrong in a good houfe is of good fignifi-\ncation.\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . *73\ncation, but much better if the ptenet be a fortunate one by nature. \u00c0\nmalefic planet, weak in the tenth houfe, denies honour, if they behold\neither the cufp or the lord thereof by any malevolent afpe\u00e9t ; then many\nimpediments or obftructions prejudice or hinder theijfrttvf\u2019s advancement.\nMars in the mid-heaven, ftrong, ufually portends%y$|tary preferment,\n^[\u00a1gnity, or profeffion. \u2022 \u2019\nSaturn or Mars, ftrong in a good houfe of a figure, are as difeords in\nmufic, corrected to effect a concord or harmony in founds ; for, being\nwell affected, they caufe a perfect good, though it be attended with dif\u2014\n^\nficult means or methods to accompany it. In fine, their good is always\ntempered with fomething of evil, becaufe they are naturally more propenfc\nto effect evil than good ; as for example, Saturn in the f\u00e9cond houfe, or\nlord thereof, and ftrong, gives riches by rapine and covetoufnefs ; in the\nfeventh he denotes the death of the wife. A malefic planet meanly af\u00ad\nfected in a good houfe oftentimes obftructs or prevents what is naturally\nfignified thereby, or at beft but meanly effects a good. As for example,\nSaturn meanly affected, viz. peregrine in the f\u00e9cond houfe, gives not\nriches, yet retains them when gathered, by being fparing and penurious.\nMars fo pofited and ill-affected, diflipates or deftroys an eftate by prodi\u00ad\ngality, and fuch other imprudent expences. Saturn, debilitated in the\neleventh houfe of a nativity, produces trouble with or by the means of\nfriends unrelated ; and the analogy is according to the debility of the pla\u00ad\nnets, and how they are beheld, and mitigated by Textiles and trines, or\ncontrarily inflamed by quartiles or oppofitions.\nAn infortune in conjunction with a fortunate planet, is either impeded\nor deprived of the good fignified ; for, though the fortunate planet be in\nhis own l\u00efruife, yet he partakes fomething of the nature or analogy of\nthe malefic, with whom he is conjoined. Three planets or more in\nconjunction, act jointly and feverally according to their refpective na\u00ad\ntures, and to their heavenly ftates, but principally according to the nature\nand ftate of the moil ftrong and ruling planet. If an infortune, cfpccially\nSaturn, be placed between two planets which are in conjunction, he pre\u00ad\nvents or retards the good promifed by the other two planets ; the nature\nor kind thereof is difeovered by the houfe of heaven wherein fuch a con-\ngrefs is made.\n\/ *\nThe lord of the afeendant applying to the conjunction of the Sun ia\ny nativity, ihews the native apt, or delights to converle with honour*\nable perfons, grandees, and fuch-like ; as alfo will be ambitious of fame,\nhonour, and dignity, &c.

ThV\nbenevolent planets Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury alfo, retrograde in any\nnativity, is of eminent import, adding to the felicity, of a native, and this\nis the more powerful if they are applying to the conjunction of the earth;\nbut the r\u00e9trogradation of Saturn or Mars in angles, is ever attended with\ndifficulties and unhappineffes, from which portions I (hall always pray,\nLibera nos, Domine.\nE N D of the F I R S T P A R T .\nAN\n\fA N\nI L L U S T R A T I O N\nO F T H E\nC E L E S T I A L S C l E N C E\nO F\nA S T R O L O G Y .\nP A R T T H E S E C O N D .\nC O N T A I N I N G T H E\nD O C T R I N E of N A T I V I T I E S ,\nA N D T H E\nA R T of R E S O L V I N G H O R A R Y Q J J E S T I ONS\nT O G E T H E R W I T H\nA Collection of Na tiv itie s of the moil eminent and remarkable\nPersons, Twins, Dwarfs, Giants, &c.\nBY E B E N E Z E R S I B L Y , A stro.

So that\nfrom a queilion ferioufly propounded almoil as much iatisfadlion may be\ngiven the querent, upon many fubjedts of enquiry, as if his nativity were\nadually known. For, as the nativity is the time of the birth of the body,\nthe horary queilion is the time of the birth of the mind; and there are\nfew perfons living but are in fome way or other fubjedl to horary doubts,\nwhich, being ferioufly propounded in the ihape of a queilion, may be fatis-\nfaitorily refolvcd. This doctrine feems to be founded upon that miraculous\nfympatby in nature, which is admirably manifeiled between the Moon\nand the lea; by which that amazing body of water is conilantly drawn\nafter her, though no man ices, or can conceive, how. In thefe fympa-\ntbies there can be no doubt but the vegetive loul of the world inviiibly\ncarries and unites a fpecific virtue from the heavens between one thing\nand another, every where working thofe fecret effects, which no mortal\ncan fail to admire. And in the prefent cafe, who is to determine what\nthis fcul cannot effect between the heavenly bodies and the animal\nfpirit of man, working fuch Sympathies, as that a queilion of impor\u00ad\ntance to our welfare cannot ilart from the mind but in a point of time\nwhen the planets and figns governing the perfon\u2019s birth are acting up\u00ad\non the very fubject that engages his thoughts and attention. And hence\nthe birth of the queilion, like the nativity of a child, carries the ilory of\n1 the\n\f\u00bf;8 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe whole matter in hand upon its forehead. And hence-alio follow\u00bb\nthat \u00edkill innatural predi&ions by which the artift it enabled tqdedjton-\nftrate the particulars of the event required ; and this as well by theftars\nof heaven as Abiathar the prieft was of old enabled to do by the fart of\nthe ephod. \u00a3\n> . , \u2018\nBut, however, the predictions that are made from the queftionary way\nare by no means fo perfe\u00e9t and corred as thole deduced from nativities;\nand therefore I recommend all judgments of futurity to be made from na\u00ad\ntivities, when they can be procured, rather than from horary queftions.\nBut at the fame time 1 am very confident that the omnifcient Creator is not\nat all wantingforany poffiblecarein his contrivance of the works of nature,\nfor the fupply of all our moderate wants and enquiries. And, if it be ef-\nfcntial to man\u2019s welfare to be forewarned of the time and thejudgment, as\nSolomon declares it is, and that the wife man Jball know it*, then it is\nplain that God has afforded means to obtain this knowledge without a mi\u00ad\nracle ; and this means may furcly be by the fars of heaven, refponding\nour horary queftions; and experience continually affirms, day by day, that\nit is fo. Not that I believe the trivial concerns and accidents of mankind,\nas fame writers have pretended, may be thus deduced, as if a glove, loft or\nor hidden in fport and wantonnefs, fhould be fo watched and attended\nby the heavenly intelligencers, that they muft needs point out where this -\npiece of leather were to be found ; or that queftions propounded out of\nmere curiofity or diverfion are to be refolved by them. No; God's works\nare ferious, and not to be made the fport and ridicule of the gay and incon-\nfiderate. For, although the heavenly contrivance may aptly relpond our\nferious and important concerns, as when David anxioufly dcfired to know\n\u2022whether befl.ould go up into any of the citiet of Judah, and which ofthem f\nyet that they fhould as aptly fatisfy our intemperate defires, and be fub-\nfervient to our frolics, is too ridiculous to imagine. There is no doubt\nbut the heavens are able to fhew us more learning than we mortals, in this\nftate of frailty and corruption, can ever attain to underft\u00e1hd ; and i( is a\ngreat bounty of God that we know fo much as we do; therefore it highly\nbecomes every wife and good man to glorify the Maker of all things for\nthe little knowledge he can and doth attain, and to be careful how he\nfperts even with the leaft among his gracious works.\nAll enquiries that are ferious, and that come under the denomination\nof an horary queftion, muft necefifarily relate either to things pajl, pre-\nfent, or to come; or to concerns that once were, noware, or may be hereafterj\nand the anfwer to fuch queftions muft be either ejjential or accidentals\nThe eftential anfwer is always one of the three things following, to wit,\n* Ecdcf. viii. it. and v. 6.\nthat\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 279\nthat the matter concerning which the.enquiry is made is, firft, to be or\nnot to be 1 ihcotid, either good or bad; and, third, either true or fa lfe .\nTherefore, i f the queftion be real, and the matter rightly ftated, the\ntrue anfwer, which is always ihort, will be eafily difcovcred by the\nfollowing roles. The accidental anfwer is that which appertains to the\naccidents of the buiinefs in hand; and is always defined by where, when,\nhow, or why* And whoever attempts to extend his judgment beyond\nthefe limits strains art beyond its bounds, and forces it to fpeak that which\nit is totally incapable of, and by this means many pretenders to Aftrology\nfail egregioufly in their undertakings. To avoid this, let the following\nqueries be attended to.\nQJJ E R Y I. Is the Subject of Enquiry to be or not t o be ?\nHere the firft thing to be attended to is the perfection or defiruCtion of\nthe matter under confideration. The perfection or completion of the\nfubje\u00e9t of enquiry may be effe&ed four feveral ways, viz. by the ap\u00ad\nplication, tranjlation, reception, and pofition, of the planets ; and thefe are\ndetermined and defined by the proper and refpe&ive fgn ificators of the\nfubjeCt of enquiry: which are, firft, the lords of thofe houfes which re\u00ad\nlate to the matter in hand ; fecondly, planets near the cufps of thofe\nhoufes ; thirdly, planets exalted or dignified therein ; and, fourthly, the\nconfignificators of thofe houfes. The lords of the houfes are thofe planets\nwhich are lords of the figns that happen to fall upon the cufps of the\nhcufes. Tne confignificators of each houfe are as follow ; of the firft\nhcufe, or afcendant, Saturn and Mars; of the f\u00e9cond, Jupiter and Venus;\nof the third, Mars and Mercury; of the fourth, Sol and Luna; of\nthe fifth, Venus and Sol; of the fixth, Mercury alone; of the feventh,\nLuna and Venus; of the eighth, Saturn and Mars; of the ninth, Jupi\u00ad\nter alone ; of the tenth, Mars and Saturn ; of the eleventh, Sol and Sa\u00ad\nturn; and of the twelfth, Venus and Jupiter. From hence it appears\nthat each houfe hath a primary and fecondary confignificator ; the firft\nwhereof arifes from the order of the planets, the other from the order\nof figns.\nThe confideration of the matter propofed is taken from that houfe\nwhich hath relation to, and fignification of, the fame ; and this ligni\u00ad\nfication of the houfes is cither Ample or compound. The iimple figni\u00ad\nfication of the houfes is that which hath relation fingly to the perfon\nof the querent ; compound fignification is that which hath relation to\nth\u00e9 matter, or quefited. The querent is he or file that aiks the queftion;\nthe matter, or quefited, is that about which the queftion is propofed.\nThe fimple lignifications of the houfes are as follow : the firft houfe\nNo. 14. 3 U fignifies\n\f2Bo a n i l l u s t r a t i o n\nlignifies the querent's life and perfon; the. f\u00e9cond, his fubftance; the\nthird, his kindred, neighbours, and ihort journeys; the fourth, his grave,\nfather, and lands j the fifth, his pleafures and offspring ; the fixfh, his\nficknefs, fervants, and fmall cattle ; the feventh, his wife, public ene\u00ad\nmies, and law-fuits ; the eighth, his death, and legacies; the ninth, his\nreligion, long voyages, and learning; the tenth, his mother, trade, and ho-,,\nnour; the eleventh, his friends and hopes; the twelfth, his private ene\u00ad\nmies, great cattle, imprifonment, and crolfes. The compound fignifica-\ntion is derived from the fimple, by confidering what houfe that is which\nfignifies the matter, or quefited; and accounting that, be it whatfoever\nhoufe it may, for its afeendant or firft houfe; and lb aferibing the figni-\nfication of the firft houfe of the figure to it: doing in like manner to all\nthe other houfes in order. So that, if a queftion relates to a brother or re\u00ad\nlation, the third houfe is then his afeendant or firft houfe, and fignifies\nhis life and perfon ; the fourth houfe (which is in this cafe his f\u00e9cond)\nhis fubftance or eftate; the fifth houfe (his third) his relations and ihort\njourneys; thefixth (his fourth) his father; the feventh his children; the\neighth his ficknefs ; the ninth his wife, &c. and the fame of all others.\nThefe things being laid as a foundation, we now come to (hew the perfec\u00ad\ntion of the matter by the different affections of the afpetis.\nApplication is when two planets haften to conjundlion or afpe& of one\nanother. The light planets only apply to the more weighty. So Saturn\napplies to none; Jupiter only to Saturn ; Mars to Saturn and Jupiter;\nSol to Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars; Venus to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and\nSol; Mercury to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol; and Venus; and Luna to\nthem all. But, if any of the higher planets be retrograde, they may then\napply to a lighter by r\u00e9trogradation. Thus Saturn may apply to Jupiter,\nMars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna; Jupiter to Mars, Sol, Venus,\nMercury, or Luna; Mars to Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna; Venus to\nMercury, or Luna; and Mercury to Luna, when retrograde. In this\napplication the lords of each houfe are not only to be tonfidered, but alfp\nthe confignificators of the fame; for, if they alfo apply together by good\nafpeft, we may give the more probable judgment. Thefe applications\nmay be always difeemed by the Ephemeris ; wherein may not only be\nfeen when the Moon applies to any alpeci, but alfo when any of the other\nplanets apply to one another.\nTranflation is when a planet feparates from the body or afpe& of one\nplanet, and immediately applies to the conjunction or afpedl of another.\nAnd the planet tranflating is always lighter, except in r\u00e9trogradation,\nthan the planets from or to whom the tranflation is made. So Luna\nmay tranflatc the light of the other planets from one to another; Mercury\n2 may\n\f2Sl\nO F A S T R O L O G Y .\nmay tranflate the light of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, and Venns, from\none to another; Venus the light of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and^Sol, from\none to another; Sol the light of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, from one to\nanother; Mars the light of Saturn and Jupiter fron^one to another; but\nJupiter and Saturn, without r\u00e9trogradation, can make no tranflation. This\ntranflation is to be confidered between the lords of the houfcs fignifying\nthe matter, the planets near the cufps, and the confignificators of the\nfame. So, if the queftion belong to the feventh houfe, and Sagittarious be\non the afcendant, then Jupiter is lord of the afcendant, and Mercury of\nthe feventh; Saturn is the firil confignificator of the afcendant, and Mars\nthe f\u00e9cond; Luna is the firft confignificator of the feventh, and Venus is\nthe f\u00e9cond. And, if the tranflation be between Jupiter and Mercury, or\nSaturn and Luna, or Mars and Venus, it may poflibly perform the mat\u00ad\nter; but, if there be a tranflation between them all, as alfo between pla\u00ad\nnets pofited near the cufps of the houles, the thing will undoubtedly be\nbrought to pafs, the fame as by application. A more weighty planet may\nalfo make a tranflation by feparating in r\u00e9trogradation from a weightier\nthan himlelf, and applying to a lighter than himfelf. So Jupiter, being\nretrograde, may feparatc from Saturn or his afpeft, and tranflate his light\nand virtue to Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna.\nReception is either Angle or mutual. A Angle reception is, when but\none of the fignificators receives the other into his dignities, viz. his houfe,\nexaltation, or triplicity; this is but of fmall force, and is called difpofi-\ntion. Mutual reception is when two planets are in each other\u2019s dignities;\nas Mars in Gemini and Mercury in Aries. This reception is threefold,\ncither by houfe, exaltation^ or triplicity. By houfe, when Saturn is in\nthe houfes ofjupiter, and Jupiter in the houfes of Saturn. By exalta\u00ad\ntion, as when Saturn is in Aries, the exaltation of Mars; and Mars in\nLibra, the exaltation of Saturn. By triplicity, as when Saturn is in Leo,\nthe triplicity of Mars; and Mars in i aurus, the triplicity of Saturn. There\nis alfo another reception of dignities; and that is, when one planet is\nin another planet's houfe, and that planet in the other's exaltation or\ntriplicity : as Saturn in Taurus, the houfe of Venus ; and Venus in Li\u00ad\nbra, the exaltation of Saturn, or in Virgo, his triplicity. Thefe recep\u00ad\ntions are remarkably ftrong and forcing, if they fall either in the antif-\ncions of each other, or in or near each other's Textile or trine.\nPofition is-when cither the lords of two houfes concerned, or the con-\nfignificators of the fame, or both, are pofited in each other's houfes; or\nthe lord of the afcendant, or its confignificator, or both, are pofited in\nthe houfe fignifying the thing, or laftly, when the lord or coniignifica-\ntors of the houfe fignifying the thing are pofited in the afcendant.\n\f282 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nSo, if the queftion belongs to the medium cceli, if the lord of the afcen-\ndant be found in the medium cceli, or lord of the medium caeli in the af-\nrcndant, or in mutual pofition, it perfedts the thing defircd. This pofi-\ntion is eminent, and* if the falA fignificators be poiited in the antifcions\nor other dignities of each other, or of the planets fignifying the thing, it\nabfolutely dcnotes^he full completion of it ; more efpecially if the faid\nfignificators By pofition are in fextile or trine to each other; or to Jupi\u00ad\nter, Sol, or Venus, or to lords of good houfes. The power of antifci^\nons are equal to a fextile or trine, chiefly if they fall near thofe points,\nor in the dignities of their proper planet, or both. Thcfe antifcions arc\nto be confidered in all the Ways aforcfaid; to wit, in application, tranf-\nlation, reception, and pofition, in which they efFedt much more than\notherwile could be imagined. If there be application of one or both fig\u00ad\nnificators, though to no afpedl, but to the antifcion of the other figni\u00ad\nficators $ or reception by antifcion with good afpedt, or a real pofition\nin antifcion of the one, with a good tranilation to the other, fignificator,\nit perfects things beyond expedtation. And thus, by any or all of the\nforegoing circumilances, may the fubjedt of enquiry be brought to pais,\nand completed.\nThe matter is deftroyed by prohibition, which is when the fignifica\u00ad\ntors arc applying to an afpedt, and, before they can come to that afpedt,\nthe lighter or applying planet comes to the conjunction or afpedt of ano\u00ad\nther; which planet deftroys what is dcfired. Or by fruftration, which\nis when fignificators are coming to an afpeCl, and the more weighty pla\u00ad\nnet, before they can make that afpedt, meets with the conjundiion or af-\npect of another planet, and thereby fruftratcs the former afpedt. Or by\nrefranation, which is when two fignificators are coming to an afpedt, and,\nbefore they can make that afpedt, the applying planet falls retrograde\nif direft, or if retrograde he becomes diredt, before he can make the\nfaid afpedt. ^ .\nThings are alfo deftroyed by afpedt, which is when the fignificators\napply to the quartile or oppofition of one another, without reception;\nor by the conjunction of the Sun, which is called combuftion, and is. the\ngreateftafflidtionof all. Alfo by feparation, whichis, when the fignificators\nof the querent, and thing proposed, have lately been in afpedt, and are\nnewly Separated, though never fo little ; and this denotes .the full and\nabfolute deftrudtion of the matter, which we feldom or ever find to fail.\nThe quality of the afpedt likewife fhews the condition of the thing or mat\u00ad\nter lately pafled, if it was good, good; if evil, evil; and it is either\ntotally deftroyed, or at leaft brought to pafs with much difficulty, if the\ntranilation be made by quartile or oppofition. But more efpecially if\nanother\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 283\nanother planet at the fame time (hall tranflate the virtue or light of both\nfignificators to Saturn or Mars, or to the lgrds of evil houfes.\nIf there be a tranflation between the figSISators by^iqiiiftrtile or oppofi-\ntion, or by fextile or trine, and, before the tranflation can be made, one\nor both of the fignificators (hall go into another fign, the matter will\ncome to nothing. If there be prohibition, fruftration, refranation, evil\nafpedt, reparation, or evil tranflation, by quartile or oppofition, without\nmutuaWeception, it is enough to deftroy the matter, but more efpecially\nif fome or all of them happen to be in fixed figns, and in a luccedent or\ncadent houfe of the figure, or from the houfe fignifying the thing. Move\u00ad\nable figns are Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn; fixed figns are Tau\u00ad\nrus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquaries; common figns are Gemini, Virgo, Sa-\ngittary, and Pifces ; angles, are the firil, fourth, feventh, and tenth ; fuc-\ncedents, are*the fecond, fifth, eighth, and eleventh, houfes; cadents, are\nthe third, fixth, ninth, and twelfth, houfes.\nQ U E R Y II.

In thefe cafes, the queftion not being radical, no\nanfw\ner can b\neobtained; an\nd therefore he who attem\npts to refolve them\n,\nwill bring flum\ne upon him\nielf, an\nd difgrace upon thefcience. Every\nqueftion, to be radical, m\nuft be lincere an\nd natural; and, unlefs they a\nre\nfo, they cannot be refolved. Therefore, to ascertain their Iincerity on\nthe one hand, and their fitnefs or unfitneis on the other, the following\nrules m\nuft be obferved.\nEre\u00a3l the figure a\ns before direfted; an\nd ifthe iign afeending, an\nd the\nplanet in the afeendant, deferibe exadtly the perfon of the querent, the\nqueftion is radical, and fit to bejudged. But, if either the very begins\nning or extrem\ne end only of the fign afeends, it will not be proper tq\ngivejudgment; for it denotes the querent to be aknave, an\ndthe queftion\na forgery, propofed m\nerely out of ridicule an\ndintem\nperate m\nirth. This\nrule I haveoftenverifiedinpraftice, by direftlychargingthequerent with\nfuch defign; an\nd the effett this unexpefted difeovery had upon themh\nas\nufually produced anacknow\nledgem\nent of it.

So, if Jupiter belord of the hour, the\nqueftion will be radical, becaufe the Sun an\nd Jupiter are of the fam\ne\ntriplicity; an\nd this obfervation extends to all the other planets, an\nd uni\u00ad\nform\nly ftiew\ns thequeftion proper to bejudged. But, w\nhenever the.tefti-\nm\nonies or fignificators in the figure are found equally ftrong for and\nagainft them\natter propounded, it ought not tobeadjudged; fpr theartift\nknows not which way the balance m\nay yield, an\nd therefore judgm\nent\nfhould be deferred to afuture tim\ne.\nThere is one rule by which the radicalnefs of aqueftion m\nay be af-\ncertained w\nith greater certainty, or at leaft with lefs probability of mis\u00ad\ntake, than by any other; an\nd this is by the m\noles with which every\nperfon is m\nore or lels m\narked. It is really a\nn aftonilhing fad, an\nd no\nlefs extraordinary than true, that thefem\noles or m\narks a\nre all uniform\nly\ndiftinguifhed by the figns an\nd planets which prevail at the tim\ne of birth,\nif n\not abfolutely produced by them\n. It w\nas the truth an\nd univerfality\nof this obfervation which firft led to the difeovery of that affedion an\nd\ngovernm\nent with the cekftial figns haveupon the different m\nem\nbers of\nm\nan's body ; af<\ni6\nt fo obvious, that, notwithftanding all endeavours to\nrefute the idea of planetary influence, yet this fad is annually recorded\nin every alm\nanack, an\nd fin\nds a place in alm\noft every other aftronom\nical\npublication.\nAccording to this rule, w\nhenever aperfon com\nes to propound aquef\u00ad\ntion, let a figure of the twelve houfes be ereded forthe querent; then\nnote w\nhat fign is upon the cufp of the afeendant, an\nd in the part of the\nquerent's body which that fign governs, if the queftion be radical, the\nquerent will haveam\nole. For inftance, if Aries be the fign afeending at\nthe tim\ne, the m\nole will beon the h\nead or face; if Taurus, o\nn the neck\nor throat; if Gem\nini, onthe arm\ns or fhoulders; if Cancer, onth\npbreaft;\nan\nd fo upon an\ny other part of the body which the fign afeending (hall\ngovern.

If the planet Saturn be the fignificator, the m\nole is either black\n~ or\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 289\nor of a darkcolour; ifM\nars be fignificator, an\ndin afieryfign, itihen re-\nfem\nbles afear, cut, or dent, in the fieih; but in any other ngnit is a red\nm\nole.

If the fignificator or planet which gives the m\nole be found a\u00ad\nbove the horizon, that is, fromthe cufp of the afeendant to the cufp of\nthe feventh, either in the twelfth, eleventh, tenth, ninth, eighth, or fe-\nventh, houfe, the m\nark or m\nole will be on the forepart of the body; but\nif the fignificator be under the earth, that is, ineither the firft, fecond,\nthird, fourth,dfcM\nRfe fifth, orfixth, houfe, it will befituatedonthe back\nor hinder part of the body.

But in the m\nonths of Novem\nber and Decem\nber,\nw\nhen figns ofihort afeenfions ye upon the afeendant, great care m\nuft be\ntaken to be exafl in point of time; for in thofe m\nonths the Sun is fre\u00ad\nquently not vifible, and clocks are not alw\nays to be depended upon;\ntherefore without proper care the right afeendant m\nay eauly be m\nilled,\nfor Pifces an\ndAries bothafeend inthe fpace offifty m\ninutes, andAqua-\n'ries an\nd Taurus in little m\nore thananhour; but,if thetim\ne be takenex-\na\u00a3\nt, no one needever m\niftruft the certainty of theie rules, andthe exa\u00a3\ni\nconform\nity of the m\narks or m\noles to the figns andplanets which repre-\n\f290 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nfcnt thttn.

If the lord of the le-\nventh be inany of the four angles, viz. in the firft, fourth, feventh, or\ntenth, houfes, the perfon you would fpeak with is certainly at hom\ne. If\nthe lord of the feventh be in any of the fuccedent houfes, viz. in the fe\u00ad\ncond, fifth, eighth, or eleventh, he is not then at hom\ne, but is n\near it,\nandm\nay with a little diligence be found ; but if the lord of the feventh\nbe in any one of the cadent houfes, viz. the third, fixth, ninth, or\ntwelfth, the party is far from hom\ne, an\nd confequently cannot be lpoken\nwith if fought for. If the lord of the afeendant apply to the lord of the\nfeventh*.by afriendly afpedt at the tim\ne of enquiry, the querent m\nay per\u00ad\nhaps m\neet the quefited, or accidentally hear of him by the way. Or, if\nthe Moon orany other pUnci transfer the light of the lord of the_feyenth\nto the lord of the afeendant, it denotes the fam\ne thing.

But, if the ptfrfon enqui\u00ad\nred after be a relation, then the lordof the feventh is not to be taken,\nbut the lord of that houfe which fignifies fuch relation; as, if it bea\nbrother, then the lordof the third m\nuft be referred to ; if a father, re\u00ad\ngardmud be'had to the lordof thefourth ; if a fon or daughter, obferve\nthelord of the fifth, andfo on* and, accordingto their pofitions, judge as\nabove fpecified.\nI f the Party long abfent be dead or altve.\nHerein alfo m\nuft be confidered what relation the querent hath to the\nparty quefited, andtake the fignificatoraccordingly. But, if therebe no\nrelation between them\n, then take the afcendant, his lord, andthe Moon,\nto fignify the party that is abfent; andjudge thus : If the lord of the\nafcendant, or the Moon, be in conjundtion with the lord of the eighth,\nora planet in the eighth, and no benevolent teftim\nonies concur, the ab\u00ad\nfent party is certainly dead. Or when the IV\nfoon\n, and the lord of the\nafcendant, ihall be in oppofition to the lord of the eighth, from the fe-\ncondand eighth, or fromthefixth andtwelfth, houfes, the abfent party\nis likewife dead. If thelordofthe afcendant be in the fourth, and the\n*\n*\n* \u2014\nMoon in the feventh, in quartile to him, it (hew\ns great danger to the\nquefited, if not abfolute death. When anevil planet (hall tranflate the\nlight of the lord of the eighth unto the lord of the afcendant, or of the\nlord,of the afcendant to the lord of the eighth, it is moil probable the\nabfent party is dead. If the Iprd of the afcendant and the Moon be in\nthe fourth houfe fromthe afcendant, orin the houfe of death, and cither\ncom\nbuft, orintheirfall, or joined with the lord of the eighth, the par\u00ad\nty quefited is undoubtedly deceafed; but if none of thefe pofitions hap\u00ad\npen, an\nd on the contrary you find the Moon, an\nd theafcendant, and its\nlord, ftrongand well fortified, theabfent party is alive and well.

And if it ihall happen that the Moon or lord of the afeendant\nbe joined to a m\nalefic planet, an\nd a\nn unfortunate planet receives them\n,\nthe querent will then obtain his defire, although it will be after long\nwaiting and with m\nany folicitations. But if there be no reception be\u00ad\ntween the lord of the afeendant, the Moon, and the infortune, notwith-\nilanding any oppofttion betw\neen them\n, yet the querent will rarely ob\u00ad\ntain his m\noney or falary enquired after. If the fignificators areinfriendly\nafpeil from good houfes of heaven, an\ndthis without im\npedim\nent or hin\u00ad\ndrance, the querent will be fuccefsful ; but, if infortunes im\npede the\n\u2022fignificator of the querent\u2019s good, confider what houfe he is lord of, and\nthat will point out the perfon or thing that obftrufts it.\nJUDGMENTS proper to the THIRD HOUSE.\nThis houfe appertainsto brethren, fillers, kindred, and neighbours; to\ninlandjourneys, an\ndrum\nours; andthereforethefequeflionsarcparticularly\nm\noil proper to it:\n1.

The queftion\nis refolved thus: If the lord of the third houfe be a benevolent planer,\nand\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 301\nand in the afcendant, or the Moon be in good afpcC\nt with a fortunate\nplanet in the third, the querent an\nd his brethren and neighbours will\nagree well. W\nhen the lord of the afcendant an\nd lord of the third are in\nfextile or trine to each other, and in m\nutual reception; or the lordof the\nthird calls a fextileor trine to the cufp of the afcendant; and the lord of\nthe afcendant or the M\noon calls the fam\ne to the cufp of the thirdTioufc;\nit is an argum\nent ofgreat unity, love, andconcord, betw\neen them\n. When\na fortunate planet is in the afcendant, and the lord,.of,the afcendant be\u00ad\nholds the cufp of the third, or applies friendly to the lord oFthe third, it\nis a\nn argum\nent ofagooddirpofitioninthequerent, andfpeaks himwilling\nto accord with his brethren, kindred, an\ndneighbours. And if afortune\nbein the third, an\nd the lordof the third apply in harm\nony to the lord of\ntheafcendant, the brethren, kindred, or neighbours, are m\noll indulging.\nThofe perfons whofe fignificators do not apply are m\noll im\nperious, a\nrid\napt todifagree; and thofe, w\nhofe fignificators m\nake application, areflexi\u00ad\nble, willing, and yielding, an\nddelirous of agreem\nent an\ndconcord. When\nSaturn, M\nars, or the Dragon\u2019s tail, in fuch a quellion, H\null be in the\nafcendant, it denotes the perfon enquiring to be obilinate, an\nd averfe\nto a friendly agreem\nent; but if they, or cither of them\n, are pofited in\nthe third houfe, thebrethren, neighbours, and kindred, a\nreof am\nalicious\ndifpofition. And, if it happens that Saturn or M\nars be peregrine, re\u00ad\ntrograde, or combuil, the m\nalice and mifehief they threaten will be the\nm\nore dangerous. When Saturn or the Dragon\u2019s head are in thethird,\nthe neighbours are obilinate, and the kindred covetous and lparing. If\nM\nars, thekindred are treacherous, and the neighbours dilhonelt. And\nthis is m\nore certain, when they are out of theirefiential dignities.\nO f the Condition and Eftate o f an abfent Brother ?\nTo refolve this quellion, conlider the lord of the third houfe, for that\nhathfignificationofbrethren; and the houfe w\nhere he is pofited, becaufe\nthat Ihew\ns the ftateandcondition of the quefited. For if the lord of the\nthiid be in conjunction, quartile, or oppolition, of the infortuncs, or in\nevil afpeC\nt of the lords of theobfeure houfes, thecondition of the brother\nis forrowful; but if on the contrary he be in good afpeC\nt with the for\u00ad\ntunes, and in propitious places of the figure, his condition is good and\nprofperous. If the lordof the'third-bepofitedin\n.th\ne\n\u00a1 fourth, in no evil\nafpett of the m\nalevolents, the brother that is abfent H\nath an intention\nto enrich himfelf in the place w\nhere he is; for the fourth houfe is the\nfecond from the third. If the lord of the third be pofited in the fifth,\nin\nof thefortunes, it Ihew\ns the abfent brother to be inhealthandvery happi\u00ad\nly fituated. But ifthelordofthe thirdhoufe beinthe fifth, voidofcourie,\n' 1 or\nconjunction with the lord of the fifth, \"W\nith of without the reception\n\f302 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n<\n*\nr in corporal conjunflion, or m\nalicious afpeft of the infortunes, and\nthis without reception, an\nd the unfortunate planets them\nfelves im\u00ad\npeded, it declares the abfent brother in a bad condition, indifpofed in\nhealth, an\nd not contented in the place w\nhere he is. But if he be found\ninany of the obfeurej^arts ofthejigure, which are naturallyevil, a\ns the\nfi\\th, eighth, or twelfth, houfes, the abfent brother is not well, nor in\naprofperous fituation. When the loxd^of thejhird isfound intheeighth\u00bb\ncither in conjunction, Textile or trine, of one of the fortunes, the abfent\nbrother is not well ; or if the lord of the third bejoined to evil planets\nin the fixth houle, or in conjutlion with the lord of the fixtb, lie is\nthen in an infirmand fickly condition ; and if the lordof the fixth be in\nthethird, except the lord of the third be well difpofed, it denotes \"tH\ne\nfam\ne. Then note whether the lord of the th\nird\n_\nb\n.e in conjunftion^with\nthe lord of-ti*e eighth, or in combuilion; for fuch aconfiguration de\u00ad\nclares he will die of theinfirm\nity. But, if the lord of the third be in the\nfiventh, the brother is in the fam\ne country he went intoat firft, an\nd con\u00ad\ntinues there ; an\ndhis condition is neither well nor ill. If the fignificator\nbe in the eighth, the abfent brother is in danger of death, particularly\nit he b\ne com\nbuft, or in conjunction with the lord of the eighth, in con-\niundion or afpcCt of the infortunes; for thefe are ilrong argum\nents of\ndeath. When the lordof the third is in the ninth, it denotes that the\nabfent brother is rem\noved from the place he firft went to, an\nd is gone\ninto am\nore rem\notecountry. And if he be in the tenth, in conjunction\nor good alpc\\t of the fortunate planets, and with reception, it denotes\nhim to have acquired fom\ne honour, office, or preferm\nent, in the place\nw\nhere he lives. But if he be in conjunction, quartile, or oppofition,\nof the infortuncs, com\nbuft, or any other way infortunated, it is to be\nfen\nred the abfent brother is dead. If the lord of the third be in the\neleventh houfe, in conjunction, Textile, or trine, of the fortunes, or in\nconjunction with the lord of the eleventh, it denotes the abfent brother\nto b\ne at the houle or place of fom\ne friend, w\nhere he is-happy and well;\nbut, if he be m\nalicioufly beheld of the unfortunate planets, he is not\nplealed with the fituation he is in, but is grieved an\nd perplexed.

Now, for the preventionof fuch accidents, andto en\u00ad\nable the reader to refolve queftions of this nature, let the following rules\nbeobferved : Give the afeendant and his lord, an\ndthe Moon, to the que\u00ad\nrent; the thirdhoufe and lord thereof to fignify thejourney ; an\nd if the\nfignificators be fwift in m\notion, orin the eflential dignities ofeach other,\nor in conjunftion, retffile, or trine, to each other, in good places of the\nfigure; the journey will be good and profperous. Or if the M\noon be\nin the third, in Textile to the afeendant, or the lord of the third caft a\nTextile or trine to the afeendant, or be in the fame; and the lord of the\nafeendant well dignified, in the third, they alfo denote a fafe and plea-\nfantjourney. If the lord of the afeendant or Moon apply to any planet\nin the third houfe, or the lord of the third to a planet in the afeen\u00ad\ndant, it likewife denotes thejourney enquired after to be pleafant. Or,\nif Jupiter or Venus be in the third houfe, it fhews a profitable and de\u00ad\nlightful journey ; particularly if they caft a fextile to the afeendant. The\nDragon's tail in the third houfe, fhews the fam\ne. When Saturn, Mars,\nor the Dragon\u2019s head, are pofited in the third houfe, or afflid the lord\nthereof, or the Moon, it portends anunluckyjourney to the querent, and\nvery ill fuccefs therein. Saturn fhew\ns the querent to be m\nelancholy and\npenfive in hisjourney; M\nars and the Dragon\u2019s head fhews him to be in\ndanger of thieves and robbers; and, if they are in huraatl figns, or fiery,\nit denotes himto be lam\ned or wounded in his journey. When the lord\nof the afeendant is.retrograde, the querent will return again before he\nhath gone to the place he interidetT; and, if the fignificators be flow, he\nm\nakes but little haftc or fpeed in his journey. Ifth#-lord of the fixth\nafflift the^%nifi.catorst the querent will fall fick by the w\nayfTfltieTord\nof the twelfth, he will be im\npededby m\nalicious people; and, if the lord\nof the eighth be the afflidling planet^ it IH\ne\nW\nsrdanger of death; particu\u00ad\nlarly if the fignificators arenear violent fixed ftars.\n%\nReports and Rumours, whether true or fa lfe-\nThis queftion m\nay beanfw\nered thus: Obferve the lord of the afeen\u00ad\ndant and the Moon, and the difpolitor of the Moon, and fee if either of\nthembe in an angleor fuccedent houfe ina fixed fign, or ingood afpedl\nwith Jupiter, the Sun, or Venus; for ufually, upon fuch configurations,\nNo. 15. 4 C the\n\f5o4 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe reports and rum\nours are true. But if the lord of the afcendant or\nthe M\noon be afflifted of Saturn or M\nars, or cadent from an angle, al\u00ad\nthough they be ftrong inthefign where they are, yet the rum\nour is falfe.\nR u m o u r s arc alfo true and good when the angles of the figure are fixed\nlig n s , an\nd the Moon an\nd Mercury infixed figns, feparating from the in\u00ad\nfo rtu n e s , and applying to a fortune pofited in any of the angles of the\nfigure. So alfo when theangles of the tenth and fourth houfes are fixed,\nand the Moon (hall be received in either of them\n, although the rum\nours\nand reports be of a\nn evil nature, yet they will hold true. If the fortu\u00ad\nnate planets Jupiter and Venus (hall be in the afcendant, and the Moon\nat the fam\ne tim\ne unfortunate, let the rum\nours or reports be ever fo mif-\nchievous and unlucky, they will be fureto prove falfe, and com\ne to no\u00ad\nthing. Mercury being retrograde or otherways afflidtcd, declares ill Tu\u00ad\nrnouts to be falfe; the like doth the afH\nidtion of that planet to whom\nMercury or the Moon applies. If thelord of the afcendantor the Moon\nlhall be under the Sun beam\ns, the truth of the rum\nour is kept fecret by\nm\nen in power, and few (hall know the truth thereof. If the Moon be\nvoid of courfe, or in quartile or oppofition of Mercury, and neither of\nthem call their fexile or trine afpedts to the afcendant, the news or ru^\nm\nour is vain andfalfe, and m\nay be fafely contradifitcd.\niThe A dvice o f a F rien d w h eth er good or bad ?\nIt fom\netim\nes happens that neighbours or friends, in fundry difficult or\nem\nbarrafT\nedcircum\nilances, willadvife and perfuade a perfon what he had\nbed todoin fuchacafe; and, if it berequired toknowwhether they intend\nfaithfully, or perfidioufly, by fuch advice, eredl your figure to the mo\u00ad\nm\nent of tim\ne they firft drop their counfel, and judge as follows: Be\u00ad\nhold the m\nid-heaven, that being the houfe fignifying advice, and fee if\nthere be any fortunateilar orplanet pofitedtherein; for then the counfel\nor advice is ferious and good, and will be proper to follow\n*.

If the lordoftheafcendant, or the\nMoon, be in the fourth houfe, or the lordof the fourth in the firil, or if\neither of them are in conjunction with the lord of the fourth, or infextile\nor trine to him with reception, it declares the accom\npliihm\nent of the\nthing without im\npedim\nent or hindrance. But if they arejoined without\nreception, or in quartile or oppoiition with perfect reception, the que\u00ad\nrent m\nay poflibly obtain his defire. Or if the fignificators be not joined\ntogether, either by bodyor afpeft, yet, if there bea tranflationof light be\u00ad\ntween them\n, either by the Moon, or another planet, it (hew\ns apoflibility\nof thepurchafe, though with much difficulty and trouble.\nThe following is alfo agood m\nethod to judge of this queftion. Give\nthe fign afeending, and the lord thereof, and the planet from whom the\nMoon is feparated, to the querent or purchafer; the feventh houfe and\nhis lord, the planet or planets pofited therein, and the Moon, to fignify\nthe thing to be bought or purchafed; and the m\nid-heaven to fignify the\nprice thereof. And if in your figure thelord of the afcendant behold the\nlord of the feventh, and the lord of the feventh apply to the lord of the\nafcendant, the fellerhatha great defire to deal with the Buyer; andif they\nchance to bein each others dignities, orany good tranflationof light hap\u00ad\npen betw\neen them, or if they apply to corporal conjudtion, the que\u00ad\nrent will agree with the feller without much difficulty or trouble.\nBut, if the application ortranflationof light be by quartile or oppoiition,\nthe buyer and feller will at laft agree; but it will be with m\nuch labour\nand lofs of tim\ne, and after m\nany probabilities of breaking off. If the\nlord of the afcendant, or the Moon, apply to the lordof the fourth ; or if\nthelord of the fourth, or the Moon, apply to the lord of the afcendant;\nor if the lord of the fourth alone ihall apply to the lord of the afcen\u00ad\ndant, an\nd there bea reception betw\neen them; or if the lord of the afcen\u00ad\ndant, or the Moon, be in the fourth, or lord of the fourth in the afcen\u00ad\ndant ; they denote the party enquiring ihall buy orpurchafe the land or\ninheritance enquired after. But, if neither of thefe happen, yet, if the\nMoon ihall transfer the light of one fignificator to the other, it denotes\nthat\n\ft06 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthat the thing will be perfe&ed by them\nediationoffriends, orbym\neiTcn-\ngers. But, if there benoapplication, reception, or tranflation of light,\nbetween them\n, then it is im\nprobable that any thing ihall be concluded\nbetw\neen them\n. '\nO f the Quality o f the T u rchafe, and whether the Querent does w ell to take it?\nTake the fourth houfe to refolve this interrogatory; andif the two\nunfortunate planets arc polited therein, either potent or peregrine, the\nthing enquired after will be w\nafted by the buyerj and at prefent is in no\nvery good condition. If the lord of the fourth be infortunated, either\nby retrogradation, detrim\nent, fall, or peregrination, it denotes the houfe\nor land to be bad. or fo encum\nbered that it will never continue long\nwith the purchafer\u00bb But if the fortunateplanets, or the Dragon\u2019stail, be\nin the fourth houfe, it lhews the bufinefs enquired after tobe good* and\nthe buyer or purchafer ihall be againer thereby. When the fortunate\nplanets caft their benevolent rays unto the fourth houfe, and the lord of\nthe fourth ihall be poiited in a good houfe, in Textile or trine to the fe-\ncond houfe or his lord, it is anargum\nent that the bargain is good, and\nthe purchafer (hall beagainer thereby. If Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius, be\nupon the cufpofthe fourthhoufe, it denotesa\nneftatetobehilly, hard,and\ndry. If Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn, the land is level, and very good.\nIf Gemini, Libra, or Aquaries, the ground is T\nom\ne part high and fom\ne\nlow $ and isinquality neither very good nor very bad. If Cancer, Scor\u00ad\npio, or Pifces it abounds with much water. An unfortunate planet in\nthe fourth, retrograde, (hew\ns the land or houfe will turn out very un- *\nlucky, and not be worth the taking, and will be accom\npanied with m\nany\ninfelicities; but if afortunate planet be poiited there ftrong, the land is\ngood, and m\nay well invite thequerent to go on, for he will have a good\nBargain. ,\nI f b ejl fo r a Terfon to remove, or abide where be is?\nIn this queftion give the afeendant and the lord thereof to fignify\nthe querent; the feventh houfe and lord thereof, to fignify the place\nto which he would go; the fourth houfe and his lord, the fubftancc of\nthe querent ; and the tenth houfe and his lord, the profit of rem\noval.\nThe lord of the afeendant or fourth in the feventh, a\u00f1d the lord of the\nafeen d an t andfeventh, fortunateplanets, fwift in m\notion, ftrong and po\u00ad\ntent w\nherethey arc, the querent then will do well to rem\nainwhere he is,\nand not rem\nove. But if the lord of the feventh be with a good planet,\nand the lords of theafeendant or fourthwithanevil one, the q\nu\ne\nr\ne\nn\ntha\nd\nbetter rem\nove, for he will get little by continuing where he is. Fortu-\n1 n\na\ntc\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y ; 3\u00b07\nnate planets in the afcendant or fourth m\nay invite the querent to rem\nain\nwhere he is. If the lords of thofe houfes are in conjunction or in good\nafpeft with fortunate ilars, it denotes the fam\ne. Unfortunate planets\nin the afcendant or fourth ihew the querent it is good to rem\nove 5 and\nif the lords of the afcendant and fourth be afflidted by the m\nalefics,\neither by body or afpeft, it denotes the fam\ne. Obferve the afflicting\nplanet or planets* and the houfe or houfes they govern, for from thence\nthe occafion of the mifehief that the querent fuftains is known; th\ne*\nlike obferve of the affifting orfriendlyplanets*whence arational anfw\nerto\nthe queftionpropofed will be eaiily obtained.\nO f treafures bid% whether attainable or not ?\nIt is not uncom\nm\non for penurious perfons to hide treafure in their\nlife-time, and to go out of the world without inform\ning their heirs or\nexecutors where to find it. W\nhenever this is fufpe&ed to be the cafe*\nand a queilion is grounded upon it, erect your figure, and confider what\napplication, reception, tranilation, &c. there m\nay be between the lords\nof the afcendant an\nd fourth houfe. If there be a friendly application\nandreception, the perfon enquiring (hall obtain the treafure he enquires\nafter; but, if there be a quartile or oppofition between the fignificators,\nwithout the reception, the treafure will rarely be found. When\nthe fignificators apply to each other corporally in a fixed fign, there are\ngreat hopes of finding and obtaining the fam\ne fpeedily; particularly\nif the application be inagoodhoufe. Both oreitherofthe lum\ninaries in\nthe afcendant no way unfortunate, or friendly beholding the fam\ne,\nargues a fpeedy recovery of the treafure hid$ but, if they ihould\nhappen to be cadent, or in quartile or oppofition thereto, it gives\nbut fm\nali hopes. If the part of fortune be in the afcendant, beheld\nby fortunate planets, or by the lum\ninaries, the querent will have a\nfair profpefcl of acquiring his wifhes ; but, if the part of fortune and\nt^e lum\ninaries be cadent, particularly the Moon ; and neither of the\nlights caft afriendly afpeft to the part of fortune, or to the afcendant;\nnor the lord of the afcendant beholding the afcendant; it is an argum\nent\nthat the querent will notobtain the treafure hid. I always find, inquef-\ntions of this nature, when fortunatejplanets are in\n\u00bb the fourth, or\ngovern the fourth, that there is treafure; and, if the lord of the af\u00ad\ncendant, or the Moon, be in good afpedl with thofe planets, the que\u00ad\nrent generally attains it by diligent fearch. But, on the contrary,\nif infortunes be in the fourth houle, or the lum\ninaries weak therein, it\nis an argum\nent of irrecoverv; or ihews that it h\nas been taken away\nbefore. * \u2022\n4\nNo. 15. a n \u00a3\n>\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nIs the trcafure hidden in the Place fuppofed ?\nA queftion being thus in agen\neral w\nay propounded, give the lord of\nthe aicendant an\nd the M\noon to the querent for his fignificators ; and\nthe fourth houfe, an\nd the planet or planets pofited therein, will fignify\nthe treafu\nre enquired after. W\nhen Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragon's\nhead, are in the fourth houfe, they declare the treafure to he in the\nplace fuppofed; and, if they be in their eflential dignities, it is very\ncertain that there is great value there. Or if any of the other planets\naie pofited in their ow\nn houfes, or in the fourth houfe without im\npedi\u00ad\nm\nent, it ihew\ns that there is treafu\nre in the place fuppofed. But if the\nfourth houle be infortunated w\nith the Dragon's tail, or Saturn or M\nars\nh\ne there, an\nd n\no w\nay eilentially dignified; or if Saturn or M\nars caft a\nquartile o\nr oppofition thereunto, there is n\no treafure at all. The lord of\nthe fourth, o\nr the M\noon, feparatingfrom\ngood planets, fhewthattherchas\nk\n^\ncn treafurehid in the place fuppofed, but that it is gone.\nShall the Querent enjoy the Fjlatc o f his Father ?\nThis queftion is oftentim\nes of great im\nportance to the proponent, an\nd\ntherefore ought to be contem\nplated with m\nore than ufual acutenefs. If\ninthe figure, judicioufly ere\u00e9ted, andcorreft totim\ne, the lord of the f\u00e9\u00ad\ncond an\nd lord of the fifth a\nre found in the m\nutual dignities \u00bfT each\nether; or the lo\nrd\n^of the f\u00e9cond in the fifth, or the lord of the fifth in\nthe f\u00e9cond; the querent will enjoy the eftate of his father. But if the\nlord of the fifth houfe be retrograde, or afflidedby fo\nrn\ne m\nalevolent pla\u00ad\nnet, it prtfagesthat m\nuch of the eftatewhich the querent's father intend\u00ad\ned for him will be w\nafted, o\nr otherw\nays difpofed of. W\nhen thelord of\nthe fifth difpofes of the part of fortune in the afeendant, or f\u00e9cond\nhoufe of the figure, there is n\nofear but the querent will enjoy what he\nexpects from his father.

If Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragon's\nhead, b\ne in afruitful fign, either in the fifth or afeendant, it is pofiiblc\nfor the querent to have three children; particularly if the M\noon lends\nher afliftance. But, if thefe planets a\nre not polited in the afeendant, or\nfifth houfe; yet, if they cail their friendly rays to either of them\n, it is\nzn argum\nent that the querent will have tw\nins. But, if fixed figns, o\nr\nm\noveable, poffefs the cufps of the afeendant or fifth houfe, an\nd the Sun\nor M\noon be pofited therein, it is acertain argum\nent that the w\nom\nan is\nbreedingwith but one child.\n\u25a0\nW hen, or in what Time, w ill the B irth happen.\nTo refolve this queftion, regardm\nu\niftbe hadtothe fignificators a\ns w\nell\nofthechilda\nsoftheperfonenquiring; an\ndtothepartot childrenalio, (a\ns\nM\no. 16. 4 \u00a3 will\n\fwill be explained hereafter,) which muft be directed by tneoojiquc aiccir-\nfions, &c. to the degree of the fifth houfe or its lord, or to Jupiter, or\nto his good afperts; and bv allowing a day to each degree of diftance, the\ntime ot birth will be nearly found. This is difcovcred by confidering\nwhat direilion or tranfit there may be either to the fifth houfe, or to Ju\u00ad\npiter, Venus, or the Moon, for at that time the woman may be delivered ;\nparticu^rly if the true tranfit or diredtion falls in the fifth, eleventh, op\nafeendant.\nO f a MeJJengerfen t on an Embafj'y> or on any important Bujinefs.\nWhen this queilion is propofed, give the afeendant and its lord to\nm thatYent the meflenger; the feventh houfe and its lord, to fignify\nhim to whom the meflenger is fent; and let the Moon fignify the mef-\nfa^e itfelf ; and the lord of the fifth the ijieffenger, and Tus management\ng of the bufinefs. When the lord of the fifth houfe ihall fepa-\nrate irom the lord of the feventh, and apply to the lord of the afeendant,\nthen judge the meflenger hath effedled his bufinefs, and is returning again,.\nAnd, if he feparates from the lord of the fecond, he then brings money\nwith him, let the fignificator of that houfe be either a fortunate or infor\u00ad\ntune. If the fignificator of the meflenger feparates from fortune pla\u00ad\nnets, it is an argument he has been honeft, and will bring good tidings\nof the bufinefs; but, if he feparates from the malevolents, it fhews the\nmeflenger has done,his bufinefs lamely, or has been hindered in the per\u00ad\nformance of it. If the fignificator of the meflenger applies to an infor\u00ad\ntune by quartile or oppofition, and this before he can ieparate from the\nlord of the feventh, it fignifies that the meflenger has met with fome\nimpediment in the bufinefs he went about from the party to whom he\nwas fent. But, if the fignificator of the meflenger (hall go to the quar\u00ad\ntile or oppofition of either of the infortunes, after he is feparated from\nthe lord of the feventh; the meflenger will receive fome prejudice or\nimpediment in his way home. If there be found an infortune in the\nninth, the meflenger will not travel fafe, but will be in danger of high\u00ad\nway robbery, and bodily hurt; but if, on the contrary, a benefic be in\nthe ninth, he will travel fafe. If the lord of the afeendant and lord of\nthe fifth are in reception, or in good afpeft from good places of the figure,\nthe meflenger is faithful, juft, and honeft ; particularly if ho be either a\nfortune, or in good afpect with a fortune. But, if there be no reception or\nafpect, and the configuration be with or in the dignities of an infortune,\nthe contrary may be expected. If there happens a reception between\nthe lord of the feventh and the lord of the fifth, the meflenger will be\nreceived; and, if at the fame time the lord of the fifth or Mercury\ntianflates the virtue of the lord of the feventh to the lord of the afeen-\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y * 337\ndant, the querent obtains whatfoever he hoped for by the meflage; which\nI have found true in a variety of inftances.\nJU DGM EN TS proper to the SIXTH HOUSE.\nThe fixth houfe gives judgment on ficknefs, fervants, and fmall cattle,\n&c. \u2018and the following queftions are commonly attributed to it : * .\n1. What Part of the Body is afflifted ?\n2. Is the Difeafe in the Body or Mind, or both ?\n4. Shall the Diflemper be chronic or acute ?\n3. What is the Caufe of the Difemper ?\n5.

Of Servants,Jhalltheyprovejufl, or dtfonejl ?\n7 \u2022 Offnall Cattle, Jhall the Querent thrive by them or not ?\nIn the former part of this work, I have ihewn what difeafes arc attribu\u00ad\nted to* each planet, houfe, and iign ; which, in refolving the firft of thefe\nlive queftions, ihould be particularly noticed.\nWhat Part of the Body is aflifted t\nHaving erefted the figure, obferve the afeendant, the fixth houfe, and\nplace of the Moon, for they are natural fignificators of the difeafe; and\nthen judge as follows: The horofeope afflitted by the prefence of an evil\nplanet, or by the pofition of the Dragon\u2019s tail, indicates that the difteria\nper lies chiefly in the head, and in that member or part of the body re-\nprefented by the fign afeending. If the Moon be afflided by the infor\u00ad\ntunes, the fick party is indifpofed in that part of the body the affliding\nplanet governs from his own houfe. If the afeendant be Scorpio, and\nMars and Venus be in the afeendant, or fixth houle, the difeafe lies in the\nhead, bowels, and fecrcts, becaufe Mars governs thofe members in either\nplace ; which rule holds good with all the other figns and planets.\nIs the Difeafe in the Body or Mind, or in'both?\nThe afeendant and the difpofitors of the Sun and the Moon bear figni-\nfication of the mind, and the lord of the afeendant and the Moon\nof the body. Now, if the afeendant, its lord, the Sun, or the Moon,\nbe afHicied, it fhews the diftemper hath feized the whole body and mind\nalfo of the fick party. If the afeendant and the difpofitors of the Sun\nand the Moon be afflided, the difeafe impairs the mind; but, if the lord*\nof the afeendant and the Moon be afflided, the difeafe affeds only the\nbody, and the mind is free. If Saturn afflid the afeendant, and the\ndifpofitor\n\fSX\n4 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\ndi\/pbfitor of the luminaries, and the Moon be at the fame time in quar\u00ad\ntile or oppofition of him, or in quartile or oppofition of the lord of the\nafeendant, the fick party is afflicted in mind, concerning the things of\nthis world, and about loiTes in his bufinefs or eftate. If Jupiter, by be\u00ad\ning lord of evil houfes, affiirt the aforefaid fignificators, the querent is\ntroubled in mind about religious tenets. If Venus, by difappointments\nin lov^ if Mars, or Mercury, by a too intenfe excrcife of the mind, by\ndudy, or by application to fcience or philofophy.\nShall the Difeafe be chronic or acute ?\nTo know this, confider the complexion of the perfon, his age, and the\n-time of the year ; for the knowledge of thefe conduce much to the dif-\ncovery of the certainty of the matter propounded. Difeafes in autumn\nand winter are ufually reputed chronical or long; but longer in winter\nthan in autumn. In fpring and fuminer, acute or lhort; but more acute\nin fpring than in fummer. So infirmities affiidting young perfons, or\nthofe in the firft half of their age, are ihortcr and lefs dangerous than\nthofe in elderly perfons, or thofe that are in the lad part of their age.\nLike wife, melancholy and phlegmatic perfons are fubjed: to chronical\ndifeafes; but fanguine and choleric perfons, to acute. Saturnine difeafes,\nwhich are cold and dry, arc ufually long and tedious; the Moon and\nVenus are protraders of the infirmity; Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, and\nMercury, fignify difeafes of no long continuance, but fuch as may re\u00ad\nturn fpeedily; but, by being lords of evil places, or otherwife affiided,\nthey may have fignification of chronic difeafes. The figns pofieffing the\nafeendant, fixth houfe, or place of the Moon, being fixed, declare a\nchronic difeafe; common figns ihew difeafes neither very long nor very\nihort; moveable figns denote the difeafe to terminate quickly, either\none way or the other. An infortune being lord of the fixth, and in the\nfixth, prefages a lading ficknefs; but, if a benefic be lord of the fixth,\nand in the fixth, the difeafe will admit of an immediate cure. The lord of\nthe afeendant, the Moon, or lord of the fixth in conjuntlion, Textile, or\ntrine, of the lord of the tenth, denotes the difeafe to be of no long conti\u00ad\nnuance; and if they be in conjunftion, Textile, or trine, of the fortunes,\nthe fame. But if the faid fignificatiors, or any of them, be in conjunc\u00ad\ntion, quartile, or oppofition, of the infortunes, the difeafe will be both\nlong and tedious ; and, if this (hall happen in fixed figns, it argues the\nduration or continuance to be dill the longer.\nW hat is the Caufe o f the Dijlem per ?\nThe caufe of the didemper is known from the pofitionsof the fignifica-\ntors of ficknefs, before deferibed, in cither of the four trigonsor triplici-\nlic s ; for therein they ibew the humour that is predominant. If thefe\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y * v s\nthe moil of them are pofited in fiery figns, they declare the diftemper to\nhave its origin from choler, whence fevers and all fuch-like difeafes pro\u00ad\nceed. But, if the fignificators be in airy figns, blood is then predomi\u00ad\nnant in the body, and the difeafe is thence caufed; as gouts, leprofics,\n&c. When the fignificators of ficknefs are in earthy figns, they declare\nthe caufe of the difeafe to have its origin from melancholy, and thofe\ndifeafes are ufually long and tedious, as confumptions, agues, |cc. And\nthe fignificators of diieafes in watery figns denote the infirmity to pro\u00ad\nceed from cold and moift caufes, as phlegm ; and thefe difeafes principally\nare coughs, phthyfic, and all difeafes of the flomach. When the pofitions\nof the fignificators do not thoroughly point out the nature of the diftem-\nper, note the fixed itars in the figure, and they will afllft in the difeovery\nof the caufe of the difeafe.\nShall theJick Party recover, or die o f the Infirmity afilifting ?\nIf the Moon deflux from the infortunes, and apply to the bsnevolents\nwithout fruilration, prohibition, or refranation, there is great hopes the\ninfirm party will recover ; fo the fignificators of ficknefs, no-way af-\nflifred, but free from the ill beams of the malevolents, declare great\nhopes of the recovery of the fick. If they are in Textile or trine of the\nluminaries, or in any friendly reception with them, or either of them,\nthe fame. The Moon, encreafing in light and motion, and being policed\nin good houfes of heaven, in Textile or trine of the lord of the afeendant,\ndenotes great hopes of life-; if the lord of the afeendant be an infortune\nin this judgment, it will no-way affeft the fick party. When the Moon\nTjfhall either be found in the afeendant, or in any of her dignities, or ffnll\ncafe a Textile or trine thereunto, it is a great argument the fick will not\ndie of the difeafe affliding. The lord of the afeendant and the Moon\ncombuil of the Sun denote death, unlefs there be fome reception be\u00ad\ntween the Sun and them; and, if they (hall be in conjunction with\nthe lord of the eighth, except Jupiter or Venus interpofe their friendly\nbeams, it ihews the fame. The lord of the eighth in an angle, and the\nMoon and lord of the afeendant cadent, or amiited of the infortunes,\nprefage mortality; the application of the lord of the afeendant or the\nMoon unto the lord of the eighth by evil afpett, ihews the fame; and,\nif he be an infortune, it puts the matter pail all doubt. The lord of\nthe afeendant in the eighth, or lord of the eighth in the afeendant, de\u00ad\nclares the irrecovery of the fick. If the lord of the eighth be in the tenth,\nand the lord of the afeendant in the fourth, fixth, or feventh, houfes, any\u00ad\nway afili&ed, it portends death to the fick party. The lord of the aicen-\ndant and Moon with violent fixed fears, according to their latitude, ge\u00ad\nnerally denote death unto the Jick.\nNo. i6* 4 F O f\n\fg 16 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nO f Servants,Jhall they prove ju ft or dijhoneji ?\nWhen this queftion is put by the matter, give the lord of the attendant\nand the attendant itfelf to iignify the querent; the iixth houfe and its\nlord to fignify the fervant. And, if the lord of the iixth commit his\ndifpofition by any friendly ray to the lord of the attendant, the fervant\nwill prove juft and honeft. If the Moon transfer the light of the lord of\nthe fixth to the lord of the attendant, by a good afpeCt, it fpcaks the ho-\nnefty of the fervant. The lord of the iixth in the dignities of the for\u00ad\ntunes in Textile or trine to the attendant, pleads for the honefty of the\nfervant. If he be near fixed ftars of a benevolent nature, the fame. But\nif the lord of the fixth ihall be in conjunction of the infortunes, and in\nquartile or oppofition to the attendant or lord thereof, the fervant will\nnot prove honeft. The Moon in the fixth, in quartile to the lord of the\nfixth in the fecond, ihews the fervant to be a pilferer, and.fuch a one as\nthe querent will never grow rich by. If the principal fignificators are\nvoid of all reception, and there be neither good application or tranflation\nof light to be found among them, the fervant is not to be trufted. When\nMercury, the natural fignificator of fervants, ihall be in the dignities of\nSaturn or Mars, and in quartile *or oppofition to the attendant or fccond\nhoufe, or either of their lords, it gives great caufe to fufped the fervant.\nIf the Dragon\u2019s tail be in the fixth, or doth affiiCt the lord of the iixth,\nit denotes the fame.\nO ffm all Cattle, Jhall the Querent thrive by them or not ?\nBy fmall cattle are meant hogs, iheep, and the like.\u2014 If the lord\nof the fixth and the lord of the fecond are in conjunction, in a\ngood houfe of heaven, the querent may thrive by them ; or, if they be in\ntextile or trine, the fame. The lord of the fixth calling a friendly afpaCi\nto the part of fortune, or being in good configuration with the difpofitor\nthereof, denotes much good to the querent by dealing in fmall cattle.\nThe lord of the fixth in the fecond, in the dignities of Jupiter or Venus,\nand Jupiter or Venus catting a Textile or trine to the fecond, or in the fe\u00ad\ncond in conjunction with him, argues great gain to the querent by deal\u00ad\ning in fmall cattle. But if, on the contrary, the lord of the fixth be un\u00ad\nfortunate, and in evil afpeCt with the lord of the attendant or fccond, or\ncaft malignant rays to either of their cufps, the querent will lofeby deal\u00ad\ning in fm\nall cattle. If the lord of the fixth be in quartile or oppofi-\ntion to the difpofitor of the part of fortune, or the Moon, the querent\ncannot thrive by dealing in fmall cattle. The fame if the lord of the fixth\nbe afflicted cither by Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon\u2019s tail; or be found either\nretrograde, combuit, cadent, or peregrine. The Dragon\u2019s tail and Mars\ni ihew\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 3x?\n(hew much lofs therein by knaves and thieves, and ill bargains, &c. and\nSaturn denotes much damage by the rot or murrain.\nIN TE R R O G A TO R IE S proper to the SE V E N TH HOUSE.\nThis houfe refolves queftions concerning marriage, partnerihip, law-\nfuits, public enemies, war, &c. thefts, fugitives, and ilrays ; which, be-\ncaufe they are of feveral diftindt natures, are treated of under thred^liffe-\nrent heads; and firft, of marriage.\ni .

Shall they accord after Marriage?\n6. Shall the Marriage be confummated or broken of ?\n' Shallthe Querent marry ?\nTo know this, confider the pofition of the lord of the afeendant, the\nMoon, and Venus, and the part of marriage, and their pofitions j for they\nall have fignification of the party enquiring in this cafe. If all or the\ngreater part of them be in prolific or fruitful figns, it is a great argument\nthat the party enquiring will marry. If the Moon or lord of the afeen\u00ad\ndant be in good afpedt with the Sun, or either of the fortunes, or near\nfixed liars of their natures, the party enquiring may marry. When the\nlord of the afeendant, the Moon, or Venus, are in the feventh houfe, or\nin the dignities of the lord ef the feventh, and the lord of the feventh\neither in the afeendant, or in fextile or trine to the faid fignificators, the\nquerent will certainly marry.

Many planets in the feventh\nhoufe, in Textile or trine to the luminaries or lord of the afeendant, denote\nthe querent will be married more than once. But, if the fignificators of\nmarriage are in fixed figns, and in afpedt with not above one planet, it\nprefages that the querent will mafry only once.\n*\nW hat K ind o f Perfon Jhall the Q jierent marry, and bow qualified f\n%\n\u25a0 Obicrve wbat planet the lord of the afeendant, or Moon, is neareft in\nafpeft with, and the iign he is in, and deferibe the perfon, either man\nor woman, accordingly ; for fuch a one the querent will marry. If the\nlord of the afeendant or Moon be in conjunction or afpe& with Venus,\nthe perfon is pleafant and affable; if with the Sun, he is noble, of a\ngreat fpirit, and imperious ; if with Mars, the perfon is many times rafh\nand furious, and fubjeCt to choler and pailion ; if with Saturn, he is in\u00ad\nclinable to melancholy, but prudent and grave; if with Jupiter, the\nperfon is juft, honeft, and religious ; if with Venus, fubtil, cunning,\n&c. Note the fixed ftars that are near the fignificators, for they often\nalter the quality of the planets. By thus coniidering the dignities and\ndebilities of the planet or planets aforefaid, the fhape, qualification, and\ntemperature, of the perfon whom the querent fhall marry may be\nknown and difeovered.\nS ta ll they accord and be happy after M arriage ?\nThe lord of the afeendant, or Moon, in conjunction,' fextile, or trine,\nof the lord of the feventh or Venus, argues much pleafure and delight\nafter marriage, and fhews the parties fhall agree well, and not quarrel;\nbut, if they are in quartile or oppoiition unto each other, it fhews much\nquarrelling\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 3\n*9\nquarrelling and contention after marriage; and* if they be in quartile,\nconjunction, or oppofition, of the infortunes, irt any places of the figure,\nit ihews the fame. Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon's tail, in the afcendant,\n(hews the querent to be imperious after marriage, and by his or her\nobftinacy will occafion much difeontent and trouble. But, if they are\npofited in the feventh houfe, the perfon whom the querent marries\nwill be the occafion of the trouble and difeontent. Benevolent planets\npofleffing the feventh houfe, and a friendly reception between the lord\nof the feventh and lord of the afcendant, denote good agreement after\nmarriage. If there happens to be a reception, through they are in\nquartile, it implies the fame.\n\u2022\u00bb ^\n\u00bb\nShall the Marriage be effcSled, or broken of ?\nThe perfon, who enquires concerning the concluding or breaking off\nan intended marriage, muit have the lord of the afcendant and moon for\niignificators ; and the perfon quefited mull have the lord of the feventh\nand the planet from which the Moon is feparated. If the lord of the af\u00ad\ncendant or Moon be joined to the lord of the feventh, or in fextile or\ntrine to him, in any of his efiential dignities, the marriage intended\nwill be brought to perfection, particularly if it be from good houfes of\nthe figure. If a quartile or oppofition happens between the fignifica-\ntors, and no reception, the intended marriage will be broken off, and\ncome to nothing. When there is no afpeCt between the iignificators,\nyet, if there be any good tranflation of light between them, and this by\na benevolent planet, the marriage may be effected by a perfon reprefented\nby the houfe that planet is lord or governor of. So alfo, if the figni-\nficator of both parties apply to a friendly afpeCt, and, before the alpett\nbe made, an infortune interpofes his malicious rays, the marriage will\nbe obftrufied by a perfon fignified by the houfe the interpofing planet\nis lord of. If the interpofing planet be lord of the third, a kiniman of\nthe querent\u2019s, or a neighbour or brother, ihall break off the bufinefs ;\nif he be lord of the tenth or fourth houfes, the father or mother of the\nquerent will obftruCt the marriage intended; and fo of the other houfes.\nOf P a r t n e r s h i p , L aw-Suits, W a r , &c.\nThe extent of this part will be better underftood by being digefteJ\ninto the following particulars :\n1.

If they are enemies by nature, and void of good\nrays toward one another, and in no reception, it is an argument that\nthey will never agree, but will be perpetually jangling, and injuring\neach other. If the lord of the afeendant be a more weighty planet than\nthe'lordof thefeventh, and better dignified, it (hews the querent will\nthrive beft in the partnerfhip; but, if the lord of the feventh be moft\nponderous, the quefited gains moft.

But, if the lord of the feventh be more powerful in digni\u00ad\nties than the lord of the afeendant, and the feventh houfe better guarded\nby theprelencc or rays of the fortunate itars than the afeendant, the ad\u00ad\nverfary will overcome. If the lords of the afeendant and feventh be\nafflicted by the infortunes, neither party will fucceed, but both will be\ninjured, if they go on with the fuit. If they fliould. both be afiifted by\nthe fortunate planets, poifibly fome friend' will make up the breach\nbetween them.

If the lord of\nthe afcendant be combuft or cadent, or in his peregrination, or if Mars\u00ab\nbe weak in the figure of the queftion, the querent will gain no honour\nor reputation in the war. If the \\prd of the afcendant be in afpeCt\nwith a good planet, and at the fame time the lord of the feventh be\nwith an* evil one, he may return home again ; but he will fuffer great\nprejudice before his return.

If\nMars ihdl be with the lord of the firft, either by conjunction, quartjle*\nor oppofition, and weak, and Saturn locally in the afcendant, the querent\nwiH be wounded. But, if Mars or the Dragon\u2019s tail ihould ill-dignify\nthe afcendant, the querent will be mortally wounded; and, it the\nlord of the afcendant and the Moon fuffer affliction at the fame time,\nhe will be killed on the fpot. ^\nShall the City, Townr Caflle, orJlrong Hold, befieged, be taken ?\nThe afcendant and lord thereof repreient the befiegers, and the fourth\nhoufc the befieged ; the lord of the fourth, the governor > the fifth and\nits lord, the ammunition, foldiery, and the afliftance they either have\nor may exped.

If Saturn be\nthe afflicting planet, the perfon enquiring will be fubjedl to ficknefs,\nand lofs of goods; but, if Mars or the Dragon\u2019s tail affli\u00e9t either the\nninth houfe or its lord, they declare danger by enemies or pirates. If\nthe ninth houfe or its lord be fortunate and drong, much good and\ngreat fuccefs are promifed to the querent in the voyage, and that he (hall\nmake a happy and fafe return. The lord of the afeendant and lord of\nthe ninth in conjunction, fextile, or trine, with each other, particularly\nif there be any reception between them, or pofitioq in each others\nhoul'es, argues an -admirable voyage, and a propitious and fafe return -\nr\nbut, if they be in quartile or oppofition, void of all reception, or if\nthere happen no good trandation between them, the querent will have\nau unauipicious voyage, and, before he returns home again, will have\nrcafon to wifh he had let it alone. If the lord of the afeendant or the\nMoon be in conjunction with a fortunate planet in the tenth houfe,\nthat being the fecond from the ninth, the querent (hall gain great (lore\nof wealth by the voyage he undertakes, and enjoy remarkable health of\nbody. But, if the lord of the afeendant or the Mooji be in abject\nplaces of the figure, or with the lords of abje\u00edt houfes, or in quartile or\noppofition to them, either peregrine or combud of the Sun, the perfon\nwill fall fick in the journey, and the voyage will be unfortunate t\u00f3\n]him j and, if they be with violent fixed liars of the fird magnitude, it\nU\nrill be worfe.\nWill\n\fO F A S T R 6 L O C Y,\nW ill the Voyage be long or Jhort ?\nThe fignificators of the perfon enquiring, and of the voyage, fwift in\nmotion, oriental, and in moveable figns, denote the voyage to be ihort\nand quick\\ but, if occidental, they (hew fome obftrudtions. When\nthe lord of the afeendant applies to the lord of the ninth, or the lord of\nthe ninth to the lord of the afeendant; or if a fortunate planet transfers\nthe light of the one to that of the other; they are good arguments of a\nfafe return, and a ihort and fpeedy voyage. The lord of the ninth in a\nfixed fign, and the lord of the afeendant and Moon in fixed figns, denote\na very long voyage to the querent; if in common figns, the voyage will\nbe indifferently good j if in moveable figns, he returns fpeedily. If the\nlord o f the afeendant be retrograde, or if either he or the Moon apply to\na planet that is retrograde, it fignifies the perfon that goes the voyage\nwill return home in a Ihort time, or perhaps before he goes to the place\nintended. .\nM ay the Querent profit by the Science intended ?\nGive the afeendant, its lord, and the Moon, to fignify the querent;\nthe ninth houfe, the lord thereof, and the planet pofited therein, to fig\u00ad\nnify the fcicnce enquired after; and, according to their pofitions and\nconfigurations, judge of the queilion. The lord of the afeendant and\nlord of the ninth in conjunftion, or in fextile or trine unto each other,\neither in or from angles or fuccedent houfes, give great hopes to the\nquerent that he (hall gain or profit by the art or fcience he intends to\nfollow. If fortunate planets poffefs the afeendant or ninth houfe, and\nthence (hall friendly behold either the cufps of each houfe or the lords of\nthem, it is an argument that the querent will profit by the art or fcience\nintended. If the Moon be pofited in the ninth, in fextile to the lord\nof the afeendant or ninth houfe in the eleventh, particularly if a recep\u00ad\ntion happen, there is no doubt but the querent will gain by the fcience\nintended, and prove a good artift thereinj but, if none of thefe things\nappear in the figure, but on the contrary there happens a quartile or oppo-\nfition between the fignificators, the party enquiring will not profit by the\nart or fcience intended. When the unfortunate planets or Dragon\u20196 tail\nare pofited in the afeendant or ninth houfe, or affliiit their lords, or the\nMoon i or if an unfortunate planet happens to be lord of the ninth, and\npofited in an evil place of the figure j. the perfon enquiring will not gain\nmuch by the fcience.\nShall\n\f33\u00ae A N I L L U S T R A T I 0 N\nShalla Clergyman obtain the Benefice be enquires after ?\nGive the afeendant an\nd its lord, an\nd the M\noon, to fignify the clergy\u00ad\nm\nan; an\nd let the ninth houfe fignify the living, or other ecclefiaftical\npreferm\nent, fought after. The lord of the afeendant or M\noon, joined to\nthe lord of the ninth by body or good afped, gives great hopes that the\nm\ninifter or querent m\nay obtain the benefice defired. If the M\noon or\nlord of.the afeendant be in the ninth, or lord of the ninth in the afeen\u00ad\ndant, or in reception w\nith each other, they a\nre very good argum\nents\nthat the querent o\nr m\ninifter (hall obtain the parfonage or church-prefer\u00ad\nm\nent defired. W\nhen the lord of the afeendant, or Moon, arejoined to\nthe Sun or Jupiter; or in fextile o\nr trine of cither of them\n, in the af\u00ad\neendant or ninth houfe; it den\notes that the querent will obtain the be\u00ad\nneficeenquiredafter. Jf the principal fignificators be in fextile or trine,\nwith reception, the preferm\nent or benefice com\nes with little trouble ; if\nthey be in\n^quartile, an\ndat the fam\ne tim\ne in reception, the benefice m\nay\nbe obtained, but it will be w\nith great trouble an\nd delay. The bufinefs\nm\nay alfo b\nebrought top\nafs by tranflation of light; for, if a planet fepa-\nrates im\nm\nediately fromthe good afpe6l of the lord of the ninth, andap\u00ad\nplies tothe lord of the afeendant; o\nr if he feparates fromthe lord of the\nafeendant, an\nd applies tothe lord of theninth% the benefice or prefer\u00ad\nm\nent will be obtained, an\nd by the m\nean\ns of a perfon fignified by the\nplanet that thus transfers the light of the fignificators to each other.\u2014\nEut, if n\non\ne of thefe teilim\nonies happen, it will be avery difficult m\nat\u00ad\nter to obtain the benefice defired. The lord of the afeendant retrograde,\ncom\nbuft, orcadent, an\nd he or the M\noon in quartile or oppofition of the\ninfortunes, or of thelord of the ninth houfe, without reception, declares\nthedeilrudionof them\natter enquired after, an\nd ihew\ns that it (hall com\ne\nto nothing.

On the LENGTH of LIFE.\nA gentlem\nan ofem\ninencean\nd fortune in his Majefty\u2019s navy, havingan\ninclination to lay out afum of m\noney on life-annuities, applied to m\ne\nwithavery prefiing folicitation to inform him w\nhether his life w\nould be\nlong or fhort, that hem\night thereby determ\nine whether fuch apurchafe\nwould be to his advantage. Not being able to procure his nativity, I\ntook dow\nn the tim\ne of the day w\nhen the queftionw\nas propofed, and,\nhaving rectifiedit by a corrcdt regulator, I im\nm\nediately projected the\nfollowing fchem\ne.\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nS38\n.My firit buiinefs was to examine the figure, to find whether it were\nradical, and fit to be adjudged, which I found to be the cafe, becaufe\nthe lord of the afcendant and the lord of the hour are of one nature and\ntriplicity ; and the fignificator of the q-uerent exa&ly defcribed his perfon,\nwhich is of a middle ftature, fanguine complexion, and of an acute un\u00ad\ndemanding, denoted by Mercury's pofition in the fign Aries, the houfe\nof Mars. The Moon being in oppofition to the fun, fhews himto have\na mark or fear near the left eye ; which was alfo true; and therefore, as\nI found all circumftances to concur in proving the queilion to be well\nand ferioufly grounded, and free from all impofition, I gave him my\njudgment upon the figure as follows.\nThe princely fign Leo, the querent\u2019s fignificator, occupies the afcen\u00ad\ndant ; and the Sun, the lord thereof, and giver of life, is pofited near\nhis meridian altitude in the medium cceli, and in the fign Aries, his\nhoufe of exaltation, ftrong, powerful, and in full dignity, free from the\nevil rays of the lords of the fixth. eighth, fourth, or fccond, houfes.\nwhich neither impedite the Sun nor the afcendant witn any cvTlafpedt.\nBut the Moon, lady of the twelfth, is in oppofition to the Sun, making\nat the fame time aquartile mundane afpedtwith the afcendant, and a fex-\ntile afpeft with Saturn in the zodiac; from which pofitions I inferred the\nfollowing particulars.\nThe affliction of the lord of the afcendant, by the oppofition of the\nMoon in Libra, the houfe of Venus, and Venus difpofitor of the Moon\nin her own houfe, and in the feminine fign Taurus, going to a femifex-\ntile with the Sun, denotes that he will receive fome considerable injury\nfrom a female connection, now exiiling under the fpecious pretence of\nfriendihip anJfond attachment \\ and this is declared by the Moon being\nlady of the twelfth, the houfe of private enemies, which difpofes of the\npart offortune, and thereby indicates that he will lofe fome part of his\nfortune by her means.\nThe Moon\u2019smundane quartile afpefl to the afcendant, in an airy fign.\ndeclares.that he will be attacked with a fevere fit of the wind cholic,\nor fome dangerous complaint in the bowels andreins; but it will not\nprove fatal to him, becaufe the Sun, the lord ofnis afcendant, is more\nilrong and powerful, and in greater dignities, than the afflidling planets;\nand therefore, according to natural efficient caufes, they will prevail over\nall fubordinate effcdls.\nFrom\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . g\n99\nFrom aconfideration of thofe parts of the figure which relate to the\ncircumilances of his pail life, I informed him he had improved his for\u00ad\ntune, and been fuccefsful in fome importagUeoyage, bccaufe the Dra\u00ad\ngon\u2019shead is iituated in his ninth houfe ; but that he had lately fuffercd\ngreatly by a violent hurricane, that threatened deilruftion ocJlupwreck$\nwhich is denoted by the oppofition of Saturn to the part of fortune, and\nthe Moon having lately feparated from anoppofition with Mercury, lord\nof the third houfe, where the Dragon's tail is pofited. This circum-\nilance I had the pleafure of hearing him acknowledge to be true; and\nthat the itormarofeonly eight days before the ihip came into port.\nHe requeued me to afcertain the time when the above illnefs would\nhappen. I accordingly took the number of degrees between the Sun and\nMoon, by fubtrading the lefs fum from the greater; and found the\n-distance to be eleven degrees fifty-nine minutes. I then fought the\nMoon\u2019s latitude, and found rt one degree thirty-three minutes fouth,\nwhich, added to the above, make thirteen degrees thirty-two minutes;\nand, as the fignificators are in moveable figns, I computed the time by\nweeks and days, and predicted this illnefs would befal him about the\nnoth of July following; and that, after he Should be reilored to health\nagain, he would go on, without fuftaining any other ferious indifpofition.\nuntil the fixty-trinth year of his age; about which time I conceive the\nfundions of life will be naturally extinguished, by a complication of in\u00ad\nfirmities.\nI have lately had the pleafure of converting with the gentleman on the\nfubjed of this queilion. He informed me, that towards the middle of\nJuly, 1783, he was attacked with a kind of bilious complaint in his\nllomach, which brought on violent fits of the cholic. That, towards\nthe latter end of the fame month, he found an obilrudion in his bowels,\nand his phyfician declared it next to a miracle that his life was faved.\nHe now appears to be in perfed health, and has funk a considerable fum\nof money in life annuities, which he deques,was.done in.confequence of\nthe verity he found in \u2018 ~\n# -rt\u00ab\nQJJESTION II. On the FATE of a SHIP at SEA,\nIntheyear 17.81, a gentleman called upon me who had a considerable\n\u00bfhare in a privateer, .which had been completely fitted out and fent to\nfea a long time before, and the proprietors could not obtain the leaft\ninformation of her. He therefore requeued' me) if in my power, to give\nhim fome probable account of what had befallen her. After convincing\nmyfelf the queilion was radical, and no trick or imposition intended.\nNo. 17. 4 M \u2018 which\n\f4oo A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nwhich isalways neceflaryto be carefullyenquiredinto by the rules already\nlaiddown for that purpofe, I proceeded to give my judgment on the fol\u00ad\nlowing figure, rc\u00a3tified to the precife time the qfleftion was propoun\u00ad\nded.\nHere the afcendant and the Moon are fignificators of the ihip ; and\nVenus, becaufe the fign Taurus, the houfe of Venus, is on the afcendant,\nis fignificatrix of the crew j and Mercury, with the Part of Fortune,\ndenote her <Wps and^all pt|iftr materials on-boardher. The Ihip itfelf\nappears well found and fubftantial, but not, a fwift failer. as is demon-\nilrated by an earthy fign poflefling the cufp of the afcendant, and the\nfituation.ofthe Dragon\u2019s head infive degrees of the fame fign. The pla\u00ad\nnet Mars is fignificator of the enemy.\nNow the Moon, which reprefents the ihip, being fituated in theeighth\nhoufe, the houfe of death and difappointment. and at the fame time be-\nfieged by the two .malefic planets Saturn and Mars, denotes her to be\noverpowered by the enemy. Mars, lord of the feventh, the houfe of\nopen\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 4oi\nopenenem\nies, being pofited with ail his dignities therein; an\nd in re\u00ad\nception of Jupiter, lord of the enem\ny\u2019s houfe of fiibflancei an\nd being\nalfo difpofitor of the M\noon, M\nercury, an\nd Venus, which reprefent the\nfhip an\ndcrew\n, obvioufly declares themto be in the hands of theenem\ny.\nThe fignificators, being pofited in fierv figns. indicate an engagem\nent to\nhavetaken place; but the fuperior llrength of the m\nalefic rays of the\ninfortunes declareit to have b\neenof ihort duration, an\nd of very unequal\nforce. The crew being reprefented by Venus, who is difpofed.of by\nM\nars in the twelfth houfe, the houfe of im\nprifonm\nent an\nd afflRion,\nplainly ihew\ns themto be imprifoned in the enem\ny\u2019s country. And a\ns\nM\nercuryis retrograde, an\nd fituated alfo in the twelfth houfe, w\nith the\nMoon\u2019s fortunate node, it is apparent that the iliip an\nd flores will never\nbe reilored to theow\nners, but will be appropriatedto the u\nfe of the cap\u00ad\ntors, or difpofed of for their advantage. The M\noon\u2019s pofition in the\neighth houfe declares the fhip to have been taken at a confiderable dif-\ntance fromhom\ne: an\ndSagittarius polT\neffin\ngthecufpof theeighth, which\nis afouth-wefl fjgn, an\nd fituated in the fouth-weft part of the heavens,\ndenotes thecapture to hare been m\nade in a fouth-weil part of the world.\nThe querent left m\ne with ilrong hopes of finding thisjudgm\nent erro\u00ad\nneous; an\nd appeared fo extrem\nely averfe to believe there could be any\ntruth init, (becaufe perhaps itoperatedfo m\nuchagainfthis own intereil,)\nthat I w\nould not fuffer him to leave the roomuntil he h\nad prom\niled\nupon his honour to let m\ne know the refult. Accordingly, in about fix\nm\nonths afterw\nards, I received aIhort note fromhim\n, inform\ning m\ne that\nthe ow\nnershad receivedadvice fromthecaptain of the privateer, that he\nhad fallen in with aFrenchfrigate of twenty-four guns, which being\nvaftly fuperior to him\n, he w\nas obliged, after a ihort refiflance, to itrike\nhis colours, an\nd w\nas carried prifoner, with the reft of the crew\n, into\nFrance.\nQUESTION III. Of an ABSENT SON, whetherDEAD orALIVE.\nA poorw\nom\nanapplied to m\ne in the greateil diflrefs of m\nind, on ac\u00ad\ncount of her fon, who h\nadturnedout wild, an\nd went to fea without the\nconfent of his friends. He had been abfent aconfiderable tim\ne, with\u00ad\nout ever once fo far reflcdting on the difconfolate fituation of his parent,\nas to be induced to ad\nd\nrefs a line to her, to rem\nove her anxiety, orto\nflate his own profpeQ\ns an\ndpurfuits. It w\nas thew\nom\nan\u2019sconfiant pradlice\nto m\nake enquiryafter himam\nong the feafaringpeople, till at length ihe\nheard an im\nperfedt ilory of fom\ne engagem\nent abroad, in which her fon\n3 \u2018 w\nas\n\fa n i l l u s t r a t i o n\nvc.-.s reported to be killed. Upon this unpleafant news, (he requeued\nme to inform her, by the rules of Aftrology, whether her fon was dead\nor alive ; or whether the account (he had heard was true or falfe. Her\nuneafinels ofmind was too apparent for me to doubt her fincerity, or to\nfuppofe the queftion not fit to be adjudged, and therefore I eroded this\nfigure, andgave my opinion thereon asfollows x\nIn this figure Virgo rifes upon the afeendant, and Mercury, lord\nthereof, and fignificator of the querent, is pofited in the twelfth houfe,\nthe houfe ofamidion and forrow. The fifth houfe of the figure is here\nconsidered as her fon\u2019s firft or afeendant, and Saturn, lord thereof, is\nhis fignificator, and as pofited in the fourth angle, or itnutn cceli, which\nrepreients the grave and termination of all things. Saturn is alfo in\nconjnndion with the part of fortune in the fourth, Wth of which are\n-difpofed of by Jupiter, and Jupiter by Mars j which malefic planet\npouefles the Ton\u2019s firft houfe or afeendant in his exaltation, and in\noppofition to the Sun and Venus in the fcventh, which is the houfe of\nopen enemies and war,\nFrom\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 343\nFrom thefe configurations I drew the inferences following; tha*\nMercury\u00bb the querent\u2019s fignificator, by being ppfitedin the twelfth houfe*\nplainly (hewed her fears were too well grounded. That Saturn, figni\u00ad\nficator of the quefited, and the part of fortune, being both difpofed of by\nJupiter, and this planet difpofea of by Mars, indicates all their benevo\u00ad\nlent effects to be deftroyed by the malignant influence of this infortune.\nMars being in the ion\u2019s afcendant, in his exaltation, and in oppofition to\nSol, is a ftrong argument of a violent death ; the kind and manner of\nwhich is thus defcribed. Saturn, his fignificator, is poiited in the fiery\nfign Sagittarius ; and Leo, which occupies the cufp of his eighth, and\nAries the cufp of his fourth, are alfo of the fiery triplicity; the Sun,\nthe giver of life and light of time, is pofited in the watery fign Cancer,\ndifpofed of by the Moon, in the watery fign Pifces, and the Moon by\nJupiter in the watery fign Scorpio ; and the whole of their influences are\ntransferred to the fiery planet Mars, in his afcendant. From thefe cir-\ncumftances it became obvious to me that the youth was no longer in ex-\niftence, that his death happened upon the water, by means of fome fatal\nwarlike inftrument, and in fome defperate engagement with an open\nenemy. \u2022\n\u25a0 The querent then afked me if I could give herany fatisfa&ory account\nhow long ago this happened. 1 took down the degrees and minutes of\nthe two principal fignificators, viz. the Sun end Mars, and fubtra&ed\nthe one from the other, which gave four degrees five minutes for the re\u00ad\nmainder ; and this being converted into time by the rules before laid\ndown for moveable figns, in which the above fignificators were pofited, I\ninformed her the accident had befallen her fon foroewhat more than a\nmonth before fhe heard the news of it. Some time afterwards a fhip ar\u00ad\nrived with an account of this engagement, which happened on the coaft\nof France, andconfirmed the whole of this judgment, by proving every\nfadt I had mentioned to have literally come to pals.\nQJJESTIONIV. On the Profpea of RICHES.\nA gentleman called upon me to enquire, whether any remarkable\nchange of circumftanccfi would everhappen to him jo refpeft of riches,\nand the time when. Conceiving his defire to arifc fromaftrong impulle\nof the mind, 1 took the exafi tune of the day, and eroded the follow\u00ad\ning figwe to refelve this queftion.\nNo. 17. The\n\f344 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nThe lord of the afcendant, and lord of the hour, being of one nature\nand triplicity, ihews the figure to be radical. And, as Gemini occupies\nthe culp of the afcendant, Mercury is its lord, and the querent's fignifi-\ncator; and being pofited in the eleventh houfe, in awatery fign, and in\ntrine to Jupiter, lord of the feventh, who is here pofited in the iixth, is\nailrong argument of riches by means of fervants, or of perfons in a fub-\nordinate capacity. The Moon, who is lady of the fecond, being in her\nexaltation, in trine afpedt to the Sun, and applying to a trine with Jupi\u00ad\nter, and a dexter trine afpe\u00a3l with Mercury, declares a great and fuddea\nhow of riches to the querent, and that unexpectedly.\nBeing much profiled to fpeak to the particular point of time when this\ngood fortune ihould come up, I considered what might be the gentle^\nman\u2019s occupationj and obferving Mercury to he his fignificator, and po-\nfited in a watery fign, I told him that I judged he belonged to the fea,\nand had fome employment on ihip-board, in a capacity where writing or\naccounts were principally concerned. This he acknowledged, by faying\nhe was captain's fecrctary. I then obfcrved that his principal fignifica*\n2 tors\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 345\ntors of wealth and riches were alfo pofited in watery figns, as the Moon\nin Cancer in the fccond houfe, and Jupiter in Scorpio in the fixth, and\nthe Sun and Mercury in Pifces in the eighth, \u00ab11 in trine afpeft of each\nother, which plainly indicated thefe riches were to come by the fea; and\nas they were to be fudden, and as it were inftantaneous, I concluded they\nwould arife by the capture of fome rich prize,, in a fouth-eail direction\nfrom London, which is denoted by the part of fortune being in the\ntwelfth houfe, and Venus, its difpoiitor, in Aquaries, a fouthern fign,\nin quartile afpett to thePart of Fortune; and the Part of Fortune being\noppoiite to Jupiter, lord of the feventh, the houfe of public enemies,\nalfo declares the querent\u2019s fortune (hould come that way; which is ren\u00ad\ndered toll more apparent, by the Part of Fortune being in fextile to the\nMoon and Mercury. When I had mentioned thefe particulars, he\nfrankly told me, his (hip was under failing orders, and he expcdtcd to be\ncalled on board every hour.\n*\nToafcertain the time when thefe riches (hould be acquired, I parti\u00ad\ncularly noticed the application of the Moon to the lord of the afcendant,\nand found them nineteen degrees diftant from a partile trine afpeft. But\nthe Moon, being fwift in motion, with three degrees north latitude, and\nMercury having no latitude, I deducted three degrees from the Moon\u2019s\nplace, which I fet down at twelve degrees; and then, by fubtratling twelve\ndegrees from'twenty-eight degrees three minutes, which is Mercury\u2019s\nplace, there remains fixtcen degrees three minutes ; which, as the Moon\nis in a moveable iign, and Mercury in a common fign, is equal to fix\u00ad\nteen weeks, or thereabout; and therefore I.concluded this good fortune\nwould happen to him in nearly that diftance of time. And I have fine*\nhad the fatisfa&ion of hearing, from the gentleman\u2019s own mouth, that\nthis prediftion was literally verified,, by the captureof arich prize, with\u00ad\nin the time fpecified.\ni\nQyESTION V.

For this purpofe I ereded my figure, not to the time this\nqueftien eras propounded, 'for, it related to an event that had long been\npafledby, ana not to any matted that was hereafter expeded to happen\u00a1\nand therefore 1 proje&ed foe fcheme to correfpond with the exaft time\nwhen this extraordinary a\u00a3H\non commenced, and at which moment the\nheavenly bodies were under the remarkable configurations delineated in\nthe following fcheme:\nThe\n\f359\nO F A S T lC*0 L O G Y .\nThe afcendant, the Moon, and Venus, reprefent the Britilh fleet}\nM ars and Aries denote that of the enemy. The firft thing to be con-\niidered is the afpedt thefe two fignificators bear to one another, which is\na partile Textile, a well-known indication of imperfect love ; and, as it\n(hews that Mars and Venus have not in themfelves an inveterate hatred,\nl'o it imports that the two commanders in chief did not behold each other\nin an afpedt of pcrfedt and direful malignancy and wrath. Venus, lady\nof the alcendant, is pofited with Jupiter in his fall, a benevolent planet\nand a lover of peace; and, as he is in this figure lord of the third houfe,\nand within fifty degrees of the afcendant, it indicates that both com\u00ad\nmanders have a defire to promote peace, by adting principally upon the\ndefeniive, and by guarding and protecting their refpedive coalls, without\na delire of any dole or decifive action, or of venturing to any great dis\u00ad\ntance from home.\nThe cool, cautious, deliberate, planet Saturn, is fituated in the firft\nhoufe, and indicates not lo much a defire lor hot and precipitate action,\n' 18. 4 R as\n\f360 a n i l l u s t r a t i o n\nas for felf-prefervation, ox the prote&ion of national wealth] <md this is\nplainly exemplified in the Rritifh Admiral\u2019s watchfulnefs and care in\ncovering and protefting the homeward*bound India fleet, as well as in\nthe French Admiral\u2019s retiring after he found his views upon that rich\nand Unguarded flota were completely fruftrated. The pofition o f Mer\u00ad\ncury, being combuft of the Son, and diipofer o f the Moon, Venus, and\nJupiter, apd lord alfo of the twelfth houfe, the houfe o f private enm ity'\nand malice, indicates private rancour and enmity in a fubordinate com\u00ad\nmander) and, as Mercury is pofited between the two fignificators, Venus\nand Mars^ evilly dignified, and combuft, fo he denotes the perfon repre\u00ad\nfented by him will infallibly be governed by malevolent principles, and\nufe his influen.ee to retard the objeft of the bufinefs in hand. The truth\nof^this indication has, I think, been too well cftablifhed to need any\nfurther iliuftration from me.\nThe enemy, as I have before obferved, is reprefented by Mars, who\nis pofited in the tenth houfe, the houfe of honour, and in the fign o f\nhis triplicity, but in the dignities of Jupiter; and this fhews that the\nenemy would as much as poflible avoid clofe aftion, but would take the\nadvantage to ihift from fighting ; and Mars, being in his fall, deprives\nthe enemy of their honour, and clearly proves, that, if a clofe and well-\nconnetted-a&ion had been kept up, and continued without ceafing, a\ndecifive vi6lory would have followed on the part o f the \u00a3ngliih, becaufe\nJupiter is in conjun&ion with Venus and the Moon, which difpofes of\nM ars; but, as Mars has the watery triplicity aftigned him, he ftiews the\nenemy ihould take the advantage of that element to run away.\nW e find alfo, in the above figure, a quartile afpeft oFSaturn and Mer\u00ad\ncury, a configuration which is always known to produce tempeftuous\nweather and ftrong winds; and this we find was the cafe off Uihant\nat the time of the above engagement. The pofition of Mercury in the\nfirft, where Saturn is fituated, plainly indicates thefe winds to be highly\nconducive to the fafety o f the enemy, but of dangerous tendency to the\nBritiih fleet, in cafe of a purfuit.\nAfter duly weighing the natural influences and efle&s o f the configu\u00ad\nrations in this figure, which are the true and genuine ftate of the hea\u00ad\nvens at the time of the engagement, I hefitated not to declare, that both\ncommanders had a ftronger inclination to preferve peace than to break it,\nand that a clofe conne&ed and decifive action was not to happen, owing\nto Saturn being in the afeendant on the fide of the Engliih, with too\nmuch thought and deliberation; and to Mars being in his fall in the\na dignities\n\fO P A S T R O L O G Y . 361\ndignities o f Jupiter, on the part of the French,, which declares their\nwatchfulnefs to run away. This judgment is likcwife further confirmed\nby the two principal iignificators not forming a warlike afpeft, but\noperating by one rather inclined to tranquillity and peace.\nWhoever contemplates the preceding figure, and defines its afpefts by\nthe rules laid down in this or in any other Treatife 'on Aftrology, will\nfind no point {trained to eflfe& the tendency o f the foregoing judgment.\nT he meaning put upon them here is uniform an<^ natural, and no more\nthan what they are and have been allowed to bear from the earlieft ages,\nand fuch as every profcflor o f the art mud allow to be confonant' to the\ndrifted rules of the fcience. If this be admitted, I think it mud drike'\nthe fenfe of every intelligent man, that this polition of the planets, on\nthe famous 27th of July, could not have been configurated to defcribe\nthe particular turns of that aftion, by mere accident, nor without hav\u00ad\ning fomc influence upon it.\u2014 A firong proof of planetary operation, as\nwell as of the moral certainty o f predicting by their means. -\nQ U E S T I O N X II. On T H E F T .\n'Being once on a journey through the W ed of England, and particular\nbufinefs detaining me in a fmall town where fome of my friends lived,\nan atrocious robbery and burglary was, during that time, committed in\nthe neighbourhood, in the houfe of a poor old blind decrepid man, who,\nby hard labour and rigid economy in hi6 younger days, had faved up\nthree hundred pounds to divide among his children at his-death. This\nmoney was kept in a firong chcil by the bedfide where the poor old man\nlay; when fome villains, watching an opportunity in the abfence of his\nfamily, made their way into his apartment, broke open the cheft, and'\ncarried off all the money undifcovered. M y friends hereupon made it\nknown that I had fome knowledge of the occult fciences, and, if applied-\nto, might poffibly give fome account how the money w ent; in confe-\nquence of which I received a letter the next day from the poor man\u2019s\neldeit fon, earneftly entreating, .my affiftanee in making a difeovery o f\nthe robbers, and to endeavour to get reflored to his father fome part at\nlead of the little all he had been years labouring to fave up for his chil\u00ad\ndren. Moved with cornpaffion at fo cruel a circumftance, I-determined\nto do my utmoft to ferve this diftrefled family, and for this purpoie\nprojected the following figure.\nThe\n\f3\n6z a n i l l u s t r a t i o n\nThe fign Taurus, occupying the afcendant, gives Venus for the querent\u2019s\nfignificatrix; the Moon, lady of the fourth, reprefents the querent\u2019s\nfather, and the feventh and tenth houfes are to denote the thieves; and,\nthe reafon I allot two houfes for them is, becatffe the feventh houfe of\nthe figure is the natural lignificator of thieves to the querent, who was\nheir to part of the money, and had been promifed it by his father, and\nconkquently bore a (hare in the lofs j and* the tenth houfe being the\nfather\u2019s feventh, reckoned from his firft, or fourth in the figure, natu\u00ad\nrally denotes thieves to h im ; and therefore, as ihe fon is querent, and\nthe father had the principal ihare in the lofs, both tbefe houfes mull be\nwell cotifidered, before any account can be given of the thieves.\n\u2022 <\n*\nHere I find Jupiter, lord of the eighth and twelfth houfe, pofited in\nthe tenth, out of all hiseflential dignities, in his fall,'and confignifica-\ntor with Mars; wherefore, 1 declared two pcrfonsJo be concerned in the\nrubbery, \u00abad described them according to thele fignificators, viz. amid*\ndie lLture, with dark brown hair, pale complexion, of a furly diipo-\nfition,\n\fO F A S T B O L O G, Y . 363\nfitted, one <bt|*ewhat fiwtor than tht -.-r; and appeared to be (ons of\na perfon who had worked with or for the querent\u2019s rather.\nM y next bufinefs was to confider what was done with the money; and,\nas there are two fignificators in refped o f the queition, namely, the fe-\nventh houfes and their lords, fo there muft be two to reprefent the dif-\npofal o f W\nthe money; and thefe are the fourth houfes and their lords.\nAccordingly I find the M oon, who governs the querent\u2019s fourth houfe,\npofited in Scorpio, a watery fign j and, being alfo underneath the fign, I\ndeclared fome part of the money was buried underneath a rock or (lone\nover which the tide Bowed, and near the habitation of the thieves,\nwhich I judged was not far difiant from the fea-fide. Again, I find Mars\nlord of the father\u2019s fourth, pofited in Capricorn, a beaftial fign, in con\u00ad\njunction with Jupiter, who governs corn, and with Saturn, who rules\nthe fruits o f the earth; and, as Mars is the lighter planet, and applies to\nJupiter, and as Jupiter is in the term o f Saturn, I concluded that an\u00ad\nother part o f the money had been paid away to fome hufbandman or far\u00ad\nmer, who refided about the diftance of eight miles fouth from the place\nwhere the robbers lived.\nW hen thefe circumftances were all thrown together, and each duly\nconfidered, fufpicion fell upon two perfons, who were brothers, in every\nrefpeft anfwering to this defeription, and who, upon enquiry, they found\nhad paid one hundred pounds to a farmer three days after the robbery\nwas committed, who lived in the fituation above deferibed, and who\nhad for fome time threatened, the parties with an aCtion, on account of\ntheir backwardnefs or inability to pay him. Upon this I was aiked if\nthe parties were taken up, whether any of the money would be recovered ?\nT o anfwer this, I referred again to the figure, and noted the fituation\nof the two luminaries, both of which are afflicted. The light of time\nis pofited in the twelfth houfe, in conjunction with Venus, lady of the\nafeendant, and fignificatrix of the querent, which affords one ftrong ar\u00ad\ngument againft recovering the money. The Moon is alfo greatly afflift-\ned in the fixth houfe, and in no afpeCt either to the Sun or to the\nafeendant, but on the contrary is applying to a trine of Mercury, lord\nof the fixth, and this to a fextile of Saturn, lord of the father\u2019s fixth,\nand alfo the fignificators of the two thieves j all which pofitions give the\nftrongeft proofs o f an utter impofiibility of recovering any part of the\nproperty, particularly as both the fignificators of the querent and his\nrather are greatly afniCted by accidental pofitions, as well as by the\npart' o f fortune being in conjunction with the Moon\u2019s unfortunate\nN o. 18. 4 S node,\n\f364 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nnode, or Dragon\u2019s tail; wherefore I judged the money loft beyond\nrecovery.\nMany circumftances, however, afterwards concurring, to confirm this\nfufpicion of the two brothers above alluded to, they were in confequence\ntaken into cuftody, and examined before feveral of the county magif-\ntrates, who found fufficient grounds to commit them for trial at the\nnext afiizes. They were in confequence arraigned; but, though fuf\u00ad\npicion fell heavy upon them, yet, as no pofitive evidence could be\nadduced to prove they were caught in the faft, or to identify the money,\nthey were both acquitted, notwithftanding the long train^jf well-con-\nnc&ed and concurring circumftances, which came out upon the trial,\nleft them guilty in the eyes of all the court.\nQ U E S T I O N X III. On L E G A C I E S .\nA perfon o f a free and convivial humour called upon me to enquire\nconcerning a legacy which his wife\u2019s mother had often promifed to\nleave them at her death; but, having had fome high words, in confe\u00ad\nquence of his loofe way of living, ihe had lately refeinded her former\npromifes; and, as this lay upon his mind, and had vexed him for fome\ndays paft, he was now defirous to know, by the eeleftial intelligencers,\nwhether this legacy would be left him or not. Finding the man fin-\ncere in his wifties, and, deeming the qneftion perfe&ly radical, I pro*\nseeded to give my judgment upon the matter as follows.\nMercury\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 36S\nMercury is here lordof the afcendant, andfignificator of the querent $\nhe is fituated in the feventh houfe, and difpofes of Jupiter, the fignifi\u00ad\ncator of his wife, who is pofited in the fourth, his own houfc, ftrong\nand powerful, and in trine afpeci to the Sun. The Moon's fortunate\nnode likewife falls in the wife'^fecond houfe, in fextile afpedt to the part\nof fortune in the querent's fecond; all which are very powerful tefti-\nmonies that the querent's wife would .not lofe her inheritance. This\nopinion is alfo flrengthened by the pofition of the benevolent planet\nJupiter, who is lord of Pifces, and the wife's fignificator, and lord alfo\nof the wife\u2019s t\u201cnth, and fignificator of the mother, viz. thefourth houfe\nin the figure; which evidently ihews a mutual love and attachment be\u00ad\ntween the mother and daughter, that nothing but death can efface, and\nto which inheritance will follow.\nThe querent\u2019s fignificator being in his fall in Pifces, a watery fign,\nand in conjunction with Venus, ihews him to be a m\nan given up to\ndrinking and conviviality* and perhaps to other fpecies of intemperance,\n\f\u00bf66 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nas is denoted by the quartile o f Jupiter and M ercury; and further (hews\nthat it has in fome meafore been the means o f alienating the wife's affec\u00ad\ntions from him. And, as Mercury is difpofed of by Jupiter, in a femi\u00ad\nnine fign, and pofited with a feminine planet, and. being alfo controver\u00ad\ntible in his nature to the quality of any planet he is in configuration\nwith, plainly manifefts the querent to be of an effeminate mind and fpi-\nrit, content to give up all rule and government to his wife, fo he nas\nbut the enjoyment of his friend and his bottle. .\nThe fituation of the Sun and the Dragon\u2019s head in the wife's fecond,\nor querent\u2019s eighth, denotes that he bad heretofore receded a legacy by\nthe death of his wife\u2019s father j which being mentioned, he readily con-\nfeffed that it was fo. This legacy he appears to have fquandered away,\nas is manifefted by the part o f fortune being in conjunci\u00f3n with the\nDragon\u2019s tail in the fecond houfe. And now, taking all the foregoing\nafpeits together, and noting that the Sun, the natural fignificators o f\nfathers, is pofited in his exaltation, with the Moon\u2019s fortunate node,\nand free from all fruftration or affliction \u00a1 and notwithstanding the que\u00ad\nrent had fquandered away the firft legacy by the father, and had lately\nfallen out with the motherj yet I hefitated not to declare, that, accord\u00ad\ning to the belt of my judgment, he would be certain of the legacy by\nthe mother alfo \u00a1 not out o f any regard or love to him, but purely\nthrough her affection and anxioufnefs for the welfare and happinefs o f\nher daughter.\nQ U E S T I O N XIV. On the Succefs of a F L E E T.\nA t the time Admiral Rodney fet fail for the W eft Indies, with a\ngrand fquadron under his command, and a convoy of above three hundred\nfail of merchant (hips, exhibiting at once the pride, the glory, and the\nriches, of this great commercial empire, I was applied to by fome naval\ngentlemen, who particularly requefted me to give them my opinion on\nthe fuccefs of the Admiral\u2019s expedition, and the fafety of his fleet.\nMany opinions had for fome time been in circulation relative to this\nequipment, and many of the firft-rate connoifleurs in politics had un\u00ad\ndertaken to declare it too Weak for the objeft of its destination, and that\nit would fall an eafy prey to the enemy; I was therefore the more rea\u00ad\ndily prevailed upon to projeft a figure for this queftion, upon which I\ndelivered my judgment as follows.\ni The\n\fc*\n>\n68 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\ntrefs, in regard to his private circumftances. But this afflidtion appears\nonly as a dark cloud, which, when the Storm is over, quickly gives way\nto the all-cheering and enlivening beams of the refreshing Sun, And\nthis is evinffed by the Admiral\u2019s fignificator having juft Separated from\nthis malignant configuration, and afterwards forming a propitious Textile\nafpeft in the zodiac, and a mundane trine afpeit to the Second houfc, the\nhoufe of profpcrity, fortune, and riches, aided by Mars, the lord there\u00ad\nof, who is Situated in the firft houfe, and in his own triplicity.\nIn examining thefe Significators, I find Saturn, who reprefents the\nAdmiral, is difpofed of by Jupiter, lord of the tenth houfe, the houfe of\nprinces, which Shews his appointment came from the king himfelf.\nVenus, lady of the enemy\u2019shoufe of fnbftance, as well as all the fignifi-\ncators of the enemy, and part of fortune alfo, are difpofed of by Saturn,\nlord of the afeendant; and Mars, the natural fignificator of war, and\nlord of the British Admiral\u2019s houfe of fubftance and riches, is pollted\nin the afeendant, in trine to Scorpio, his own Sign, in the ninth, the\nhoufe of fea-voyages; and, being alfo in his own triplicity, Shews that\nthis voyage Shall be profperousand important. This judgment is greatly\nStrengthened by the pofnion of the propitious fixed Star Fomahaut,\nin the firft houfe; which, being of the nature of Venus and Mercury,\nand of the firft magnitude, and joined with Mars in Pifces, declares\ngreat riches, honour, and preferment, Should be acquired by this voy\u00ad\nage, and fuch as Should place the noble commander above the frowns\nand malice of both his public and private enemies.\nThe Sign on the feventh houfe, and the intercepted fign Virgo, Shew\nthe destination of the fleet; and the Sun and Mercury reprefent the\nenemies they Shall meet with; and, as the lord of the feventh is pofited\nin a fgn that has more planets within its degrees than one, fo it points\nout that the Admiral Shall be engaged with more fleets than one. Here\nis alfo a moil remarkable reception between Venus and Mars in exalta\u00ad\ntion ; Mars being pofited in the fign of the exaltation of Venus, and\nVenus in the fignof theexaltation of Mars; and, as Venus is lady of the\nenemy\u2019s houfe of fubftance, this reception declares that the British Sleet\nwill capture many rich and noble prizes, and make great havock with\nthe fubftance or riches of the enemy. Mars being in Textile afpefit with\nthe part of fortune, and the Sun lord of the feventh, Shews thefe prizes\n'L Mbe taken with much fighting. And that the vidtory Shall declare\nf on the Side of the English, is manifested by Venus, fignificatrix\nof the enemy\u2019s fubftance, being difpofed of by Saturn, the lord of the\nafeendant, and fignificator of the British Admiral.\nAfter\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 369\nAfter duly weighing the probable tendency of all thefe propitious\nafpe&s, and refle&ing that the Moon, whofe influence is considerable,\nis polited in the dignities of Saturn; andthat Jupiter and Saturn difpofe\nof all the planets in the figure; and likewife that Jupiter and Saturn\nare the grand fignificators of the Britiih Admiral and fleet, I boldly af\u00ad\nfirm\ned this expedition would prove fortunate and fuccefsful, crowning\nits com\nm\nanders, and all under them, with honour, glory, and riches,\nand adding immortal fam\ne to the annals of the Britiih page. This is a\nfad that has accordingly happened, andfitchas comes within the cogni\u00ad\nzance of every individual. \u2019 .\nQUESTION XV. On PLACES and PREFERMENTS.\nA gentleman whn h*A fV\n\u00bb\n- fom\ne time been foliciting for promotion in\n_\u2014 a\niw\ni. with feveral unpleafant rebuffs, which m\nade\nhimalmoil defpair of fuccefs, cam\ne to aik my opinion whether,\u2019 if he\nperfevered in his folicitations, he ihould eventually obtain the prefer\u00ad\nment he fo much dcfired. I gave my judgment of this qucftion from\nthe following figure.\nJlerc\n\f370 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nHere the celeftial Crab afcends upon the horQicope, and :\u2019the Moon*\nfignificatrix of the querent* is pofited in the fign Leo. The tenth houfe\nbears fignification of the qugrent's honour and promotion; and the ele\u00ad\nventh denotes his friends and patrons. The Moon, lady of the afeend-\nant* being pofited in the fecond houfe* out of all her elTential dignities*\ndeclares the querent to be in diflrefied circumilanccs, and that his failure\nhitherto has been greatly owing to the want of money. His patrons in\nthe prefent bufinefs are deferibed by Venus, who being pofited in the\nfign Pifces, in every degree of her exaltation, fhews them to be of fuf-\nficient weight and intereft to accomplish his defires; and as Venus is\nalfo in a propitious fextile afpett with Mars, and in trine to the afeen-\ndant, it indicates that his petition ihall be attended to, and his wiihes\ngratified.\nThis judgment is abundantly confirmed by the following confidera-\ntions. The Sun is pofited in the medium cceli, the houfe of his ex\u00ad\naltation; and the fortunate node of the Moon is conjoined with him\nin the tenth alfo, which is an irrefragible argument of honour and pre\u00ad\nferment. It is alfo to be obferved that the Sun is lord of the fecond\nhoufe, and difpofes of the Moon, the querent\u2019s fignificatrix j and thus\nthews that his preferment thoald be in the military line. And as a\nwatery fign rifes upon his afeendant, and occupies the cufp of his ninth\nhoufe, and as Mercury, lord of his third houfe, is pofited in his ninth,\nit declares he ihall be fubjedt to an employment upon water; and, being\nin Scorpio, a fixed fign, denotes the querent (hall be fubje.i. to a long\ncontinuance upon the water, and at a great diilance from home. Venus\nbeing lilcewife in the fame fign, inihe triplicity of Mars, and Mars in\nthe triplicity of Venus, and in fextile afpect of each other, denotes he\n(hall hereafter meet with a number of friends, and prove remarkably\nfortunate in his poft. This poft is reprefented by the fituation of the\nMoon in Leo, and Mars in Taurus, and the Sun in Aries, to be a com\u00ad\nmand on board (hip, over foldiers or marines; and this he acknow\u00ad\nledged was what he had been foliciting for, and what I told him he\nwould certainly fuccecd in.\nHe then requefted me to afeertain the length of time in which I fup-\npofed this command would be given him.

In this moment it is that the\nRare begin to a&and operate their influence upon the new-born infant,\nby .the power or intervention of thofc angels who rule and govern the\nconstellations then level with the horizon, nr that afeend upon the ho\u00bb\nrofeope, according to that faying of St. Jerome, in his comment upon\nthe eighteenth chapter of St. Matthew, where he lays, Great is the dig\u00ad\nnityoffouls, for every one at tbeir jtrfi coming into the worldhave an an\u00ad\ngel appointedfor tbeir cujlody and fafety. And, as it is from thefe confi\u00ad\ngurations that we are enabled to point out the incidents of the native\u2019s\nfuture life, to is it abfolutely neoeffary that the very inftant of birth\nfhould be wetland minutely ascertained, in order to arrive at corredneft\nand certainty in thefe fpeculations. It mud be obvious to every one\nthat the cdeilial bodies are in perpetual motion, and therefore every\nquarter of an hour muff considerably vary their pofition ; as does alfo\ndifferent parallels from any one given poiot of the heavens j and hence\nit is that the latitude, as well as the true time of birth, becomes fo\nabfolutely neceffary in calculating or bringing un abe dire\u00e9\u00fcons of a\n\u2022 \u2022\nnativity.\nBy knowing the place of birth, the latitude is eafily afeertained ;\nbut to determine the precife time of a native's emerging from the womb\nis a circumftance that has been always found difficult and precarious }\nnot only on account of the inattentiony f nurfes and midwives to this\nmoil interefting event, but alfo by reafon of the difference and uncer-.\ntainty of almoll all clocks, watdhes, and dials, in reference to the\nSun. Wherefore the ancient profeffors of this art, to remove the\nerrors in the common or eflimate time of birth, have contrived ie-\nveral ways of rc\u00e9lifying a nativity \u00a1 and have given fuch rules for this\npurpofe, that the true tim\u00e9 of birth may be thereby correctly afeertain\u00ad\ned. This rectification may be effected three different ways \u00a1 firfl, by\nthe Trutinam Hermetis, or Trutine of Hermes; fecondly, by the Ani\u00ad\nmoder of Ptolomy; and, thirdly, by the naturalaccidents oj the native.\nThefe three methods I fhall explain fully, when I come to treat of the\nrectifications of nativities j fumceit here to fay, that the method moftly\nin ufe, and which is found liable to the lcafl error, particularly in the\ng\ne\nn\nitu\nr\ne\na\n\ff\n\f\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 391\ngenitures of grow\nn perfons, is that of reflifying by fuch accidents a\ns\nmight have-%\nefallen them during their pail life.\nAs the do\u00e9lrineof nativities is the very eiT\nen\nceof Aftrology, and the\nprincipal criterion by whichm\nankindwill judge of the utility and rea-\nfonablenefs of the feience, it will berequisite for m\ne in this place to be\na\ns plainand circum\nilantial a\ns pofliblc. It cannot be unentertaining, nor\nwholly ufelefs\u00a3even to a com\nm\nonread\ner, m\nuch lefstothofewho m\neanto\niludy the heart, to know the true grounds upon which this part of the\nfcience is founded-, together with thofe a\nfjp\ne\nd\nts or configurations at\nbirth, fromwhich ourpredictions a\nrefram\nedj an\nd the tim\ne alfo when\ntheir influence an\nd effects will vifibly operate upon the body o\nr affairs\nof the native. In elucidating this fubject, I ihall be principally guided\nby the Quadripartite of the great Ptplom\ny ; the truth an\nd excellency\nof whofe doCtrine the experience of m\nany ages, an\nd the obfervations of\nthe m\noil intelligent profeifors of this art, have fully eilablifhed and\nconfirm\ned.\nIt is m\nanifefl to the m\noil fuperficial obferver, that a certain fecret\npow\ner is diffufedthrough all things that are n\near the earth, according\nto the nature an\nd properties of the firm\nam\nent, an\nd circum\nam\nbient\nair, an\nd to the pow\ner an\nd influence of the lum\ninaries and other ce-\nleilial bodies. The Sun being the fuperior lum\ninary an\nd the foun\u00ad\ntain of life, governs all things that b\near relation to the earth, not only\nby varying the feafons, an\nd bringing to perfection the feeds of anim\nals,\nand the fruitfulnefs of plants, the flowing of w\naters and the m\nutation\nof bodies, but alfo the changes of the day, of heat an\nd m\noiflure, of\ndrinefs an\nd cold, a\ns it hath refpeC\nl to the m\neridian, or m\nid-heaven.\u2014\nThe M\noon alfo, being n\nearefl to theearth, diflils dow\nn an am\nazing in\u00ad\nfluence, by which things anim\nate an\nd inanim\nateareaffcC\ntedan\nd changed.\nRivers areaugm\nentedan\nd dim\ninifhed according to her light -, the tides\nvary a\ns fhe rifes an\nd fets; plants and anim\nals, in whole or in part, in-\ncreafean\nddecreafe with her. In the fam\ne m\nanner the ftars, fixed an\nd\nerratic, a\ns they keep o\nn their uniform courfe, caufe m\nany appearances\naround us, for they produce cold an\nd heat, an\nd w\nind an\nd rain, by\nwhich alfo things onearth are fuitably governed; an\ndtheir m\nutual con\u00ad\nfigurations, a\ns their influences co-operate with or oppofe one another,\nproduce variations accordingly.\nThe pow\ner of the Sun is on all hands adm\nitted tobe m\noil prevalent,\na\ns it is obvioufly m\noil univerfal. The other heavenly bodies, according\nNo. 20. 5 B to\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n392\nto the varietyof theirafpedls with the Sun, unite with, o\nrr\ne\nfill,his in\u00ad\nfluence, agreeable to the nature and force of fuch afpeds. *Xlm hap\u00ad\npens m\noil frequently, an\nd m\noft forcibly, with the M\noon, at all the\nchanges. Gut thefe affe&\nions in the ilars operate m\nore obfcurely, an\nd\nem\nploy longer tim\ne, according to their declination, or as they appear or\ndifappear in our horizon. Hence then, by the rules of nature, an\nd the\nteilim\nony of our own reafon and experience, it m\nuit be adm\nitted, that\nof all the planets, the influence of tneSun is the m\noil powerful; and\nthat the influence of the other planets have moil energy, when the\nbeam\ns of the Sun co-operate with them\n. The M\noon likewife, by rea\u00ad\nfon of her fwiftnefs, an\nd proxim\nity to the earth, m\nodifies an\nd conveys\nthefe influences to fublunary bodies, with a force fupcrior to all the\nother ilars. And thefe influences are alw\nays m\noil powerful, an\nd m\noil\nvifible in their eflfeds, w\nhen this m\nediationof the M\noon is exercifed in\nconveying the influences of the ilars to the Sun, or of the Sun to the\nother ilars, an\nd thence to the earth. But, in defining thefe varying pro-'\nperties an\nd effeifs, particular regard m\nuil be had to the latitude, decli\u00ad\nnation, rifing, an\nd fetting, of the ilars, both fixedan\nd erratic, efpccially'\nthofe which approach neareil to the ecliptic.\nW\nhoever contem\nplates thefe prem\nifes, an\nd attentively obferves the\nafpefts, will find that not only conjoined bodies arefubjedt to the confi\u00ad\ngurations of the ilars, but alfo the buddings an\nd perfedlion of feeds are\nfram\nedan\nd form\ned according to the quality with which the heavenly\nm\natter an\nd circum\nam\nbient air is endued. The obiervant huibandm\nan\nan\nd ihepherd preconjedure the proper feafon\ns for feed-fowing, planting,\nan\nd procreation of anim\nals, by confulting the ilate of the w\ninds an\nd\nthe face of the iky. The ikilful m\nariner likewife prepares againil the\ndangers of a\nnapproaching ilorm by fim\nilar obfcrvations; but they are\nfrequently deceivedfor w\nant of better experience,an\nd anadequate know\u00ad\nledge of the courfcs an\ndeffedts of the heavenly bodies, which, when ex\u00ad\nactly underitood, conduce to an alm\noil certain preicience herein. For\nit is found, that he who corredly know\ns the m\notions of the ilars, an\nd\ntheir configurations with the Sunan\nd M\noon, an\nd is not ignorant of th\ne\ntim\nes, n\nor the place, nor the afpe\u00a3ts, and is well ikilled in the fim\nple\nw\nays of nature, can adm\nirably foretel, in any feafon, the proper ilate\nan\nd tem\nperatureof the air; a\ns that it willbe hotteran\ndm\noiiler, or colder\nor drier, according to the n\nature an\nd properties of the refpedlive rays\nof the ilars an\nd M\noon configuratedwith theSun. And, a\nsthefe fpecula-\ntions a\nre founded upon the m\noil fim\nple principles of nature, a\ns that th\ne\nSun is hot an\nddry, and the M\noon is cold and m\noiil, and the obferva-\ntioni\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 393\ntions deduced herefrom a\nre feldomknow\nn to vary ; fo, by fim\nilar qua\u00ad\nlities an\nd obfervations, an\nd by ru\nles equally well founded, w\ne obtain a\nlegal an\nd a\nnextenfive prefcience refpctiing m\nan. For, fromthe natural\nR\nate of the am\nbient an\nd heavenly m\natter at the tim\ne of the conftrudfion\nof the body, itiseafy to know in general, the quality an\nd tem\nparatureof\neach perfon born j that fuch ihall be the form\nation of his body, and\nfuch the difpofition of his m\nind, an\nd fuch the future events, advantage\u00ad\nous or difadvantageous, ofhis life, according to theR\nate of the heavens\nat that particular tim\ne, w\nhether qualified for the produ&ion of fuch a\ntem\nper, or w\nhether inim\nical toit. Thus, a prefage is not only pofiiblft\nby the law\ns ofnature, but proper an\nd neceffary to the wifdoman\nd well\u00ad\nbeing of fociety.\nThe errors of thofe who do not underftand the fundam\nental princi\u00ad\nples of this learning havedoubtlefs afforded ftrong an\nd plaufible reafon\ns\nto the bulk ofm\nankind for difcarding it altogether, an\nd for confidering\nthofe events which others have m\norefuccefsfully afcertained, to be the\neffetts of m\nere chance. But furely ado6irine is not to be reje&\ned, be-\ncaufe fom\ne of its follow\nersare vicious or ignorant. In this fpeculation,\nabove all others, reafon\nable allow\nances fhould be m\nade, a\ns well for the\nw\neaknefs of hum\nan com\nprehenfion, a\nsfor the great an\nd undefinable ex\u00ad\ntent of thecontem\nplation. Much depends upon the ability of the phy-\nfician, in m\nodifying an\ndproportioning his prefcription, not only to cor-\nrefpond with the ilate of thedifeafe, but alfo with the tem\nperature an\nd\nconflitutionof the patient. In the fubjedt u\nn\nd\ner confideration, a judg\u00ad\nm\nent nolcfsfagacious is abfolutely necefiary; becaufe the quality of the\nheavenly m\natter is often conjedtural, an\nd the m\nixtures of different af-\nped\nts and influences are fom\netim\nes fo com\nplicated, that the brighteft\nunderftandingcan fcarcely arran\nge themwithprecifion.\nBut the confiderationof Nativities, inpoints which relate to the par\u00ad\nticular tem\nper and difpofition of refpective perfons, hath other caufes\nin nature too apt to be forgotten, or perh\naps lightly p\naffedover as cir-\ncum\nftancesof n\no m\nom\nent. But it is undeniably true, an\nd m\nuff be ad\u00ad\nm\nitted o\nn all hands, that the place of birth will often m\nake confidera-\nble difference in thofe w\nho a\nre born ; and though the feed b\ne the fam\ne\nfrom which they are procreated, and though the conffitution of the\nheavens be the lam\ne, yet the diverfities of countries w\nherein they a\nr\ne\nj\nborn will naturally produce adifference in their bod\nies an\nd m\ninds. Be-\nfides this, adifferent educationan\nd cuflom will forma different difpo\u00ad\nfition and m\nan\nn\ner of life; a\ns does alio the different fituationor claffes\n1 in\n\f394 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nin which m\nankind a\nre brought up, an\nd to which they are accuftom\ned.\nTherefore he who d\noes not attentively confider each of thefe diftinttions,\nan\nd unite themjudicioufly with the cau\nfes produced by the am\nbient and\nheavenly m\natter, will m\neet with great uncertainty in his conclufions.\nFor, although the pow\nerof h\neaven is confeffedly the greateil, an\nd with\nthefe all the others a\nreconceived a\nsadjuvant caufes, yet they do not al\u00ad\nw\nays aiium\ne the circum\nam\nbient m\natter a\ns a concaufe ; confequently\nthofe w\nho attem\npt to predift from the m\notion of the heavenly bodies\nalone, without duereferen\nceto thefeconfiderations, will entail contem\npt\nupon them\nfelvcs, an\nd difgrace upon the fciencc.\nBut that afirological predictions a\nre poffible, an\nd to be defin\ned with\ngreat prccifion, w\nhen properly m\nanaged, is a\nn affertion m\nolt true,\nan\nd which, I flatter m\nyfelf, I have already m\nade m\nanifeil. It rem\nains,\ntherefore, that w\ne fpeak of the advantages of this benevolent difpenfa-\ntion of Providence ; for, if aforeknow\nledge b\ne advantageous o\nr necef-\nfary to the iafety an\ndfuture happinefs of thefoul, w\nhat can b\nem\norefoin\nrelped of the body, iinceit afford\ns not only tem\nporal delight, happinefs,\nan\nd pleafure, but en\nables u\ns to u\nn\nderilan\nd things both divine an\nd hu\u00ad\nm\nan? W\nhatever happens in the courfe of nature, either neceffarily, or\naccidentally that m\naterially affe&\ns ou\nr profperity o\nr advcrlity, an\nd either\nprolongs life or deitroys it, if they happen luddenly an\nd unexpectedly,\nconfound w\nith fear, or tranfport w\nith joy; but, if they a\nre foreknow\nn,\nthey fortify the m\nind by fuch foreknow\nledge, an\nd p\nrep\nare it for fuftain-\ning the bell or w\norlt occurrences with calm\nnefs an\nd ferenity.

W\nhere then, to m\ninds fraught with reafon an\nd integrity,\ncan b\nethehorror, thediftrefs, or calam\nity, of knowing the tim\ne w\nhen\nthat certain event iliall take place ? To m\nen of avirtuous habit, fuch\naknow\nledge m\null b\ne invaluable ; an\nd to thofe of lefs fcrupulous prin\u00ad\nciples, it cannot b\ne unw\nelcom\ne, provided reafo\nn o\nr philofophy m\nake up\nany p\nart of theirconilitution.

To the inconfiderate an\nd\nw\norldly m\ninded, it not only gives the fam\ne advantages, but begets in\nthemap\nro\np\nerfen\nfeofth\nem\nore im\nportant concerns of that endleis ftate\nof exillcnce, \u201c from w\nhence no traveller returns.\u201d For thefe grand\npurpofes\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 395\np\nu\nr\np\no\nie\nsc\nh\nie\nfly\n,the all-wife and benevolent hand of Providence feet\u00bb*\nto have pointed out to m\nankind the Art of Prefeience and Prediction j\nnot to fay any thing of the innum\nerable lefs im\nportant concerns of hu\u00ad\nm\nan affairs, which m\nay oftentim\nes afford lingular advantage and happi-\nnefs to individuals, as well as to ilates and focieties, by being thus time\u00ad\nly forew\narned of what ihall hereafter com\ne to pafs. And furely I need\nnot m\nention a ftronger inftance of the advantages of prefeience, than\nwhat will naturally arrfe fromthe obfervationof every m\nanof experience\nwhen he looks back upon the occurrences of his pail life, and recoilefts\nbut half the Ioffes and inconveniences he has fuilained, only for want of\nthat foreknowledge in worldlyaffairs which theart ofpredi&ion fupptics.\nWe are not however to believe, that the accidents and events of life\nfo befal m\nen, as though a law were fet over them by fom\nc indiffoluble\ncaufe from above, by which they are of neceffity brought to pafs, no\nother caufe being able to oppofe or prevent them. .It w\nere unphilofo-\nphical and abfurd thus to imagine$ for the m\notion of the heavenly bo\u00ad\ndies isim\nm\nutable by divine law, and the m\nutation of earthly things is\ndifpofed of and revealed by a natural generationand order, which the i'u-\nperior caufe follows by accident. It is alfo to be obferved, that m\nany\nthings happento m\nan, not only by reafon of the natural and properqua\u00ad\nlity of the heavenly m\natter, but alfo by the operation of fom\ne m\nore uni-\nverfal caufes ; a\ns by great m\nutations andm\nixtures ofthe elem\nents, plagues\nand peftilences, and floods and conflagrations, are produced, by which\nmultitudes are at once fwept away, and perifh under one common fata\u00ad\nlity. Thus greater caufes always overcom\ne the lefs, and the flronger\nthe weaker; and, whenever the ftronger power prevails in any great mu\u00ad\ntation, the m\nore general effedls we have been fpeaking of happen. \u25a0\nOther things likewife happen to individuals; becaufethe natural proper\u00ad\nty of each isovercom\ne by the contrariety of the circumambient m\natter,\nwhether the antipathy thereofbefm\nall or fortuitous. Now, this being\nadm\nitted, it becom\nes apparent thatof thofe things which happen gene\u00ad\nrally and particularly, be the accident whatever it m\nay, whofe firft\ncaufe is ftrong and irreiiftable, andno other caufe having power to with-\nftand it, com\ne to pafs wholly by neceility. But thofe accidents\nwhich have a weaker caufe are overthrown, if any other caufe, able to\nwithftand it, is found; and, if fucha refilling caufe appears not, then\nthofeaccidents happen agreeableto the nature and im\npulfe of their firft\ncaufe; and they are produced, not through the ftrength of the caufe, nor\nby neceflity, but becaufe the antipathy by which it might have been\ndeftroyed is neither known nor to be defined. Thus it happens to\nall things that have a natural caufe and beginning, as m\netals, ftones,\nN\no\n. 2\n0\n. 5 C plants.\n\f396 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N .\nplants, anim\nals, wounds, ficknefs, affections, &c. fom\neof which work\nneccffarily, and others not, except when fomcthing is found of fuffici-\nent ftrength to oppofe their efficient pow\ner. Hence it is dem\nonftrable,\nthat, though fimplecaufes have natural properties peculiar to them\nfelves,\nyet there areother caufes equally Am\nple, which operate in contadl with\nthofe of the form\ner, and by which the bare Am\nple nature of each is\nchanged by m\nutation into a third quality which differs in nature from\neither of the former; according to which fuch Am\nple natural proper\u00ad\nties are either partly or wholly changed, or otherwife fruftrated or di\u00ad\nverted. As for exam\nple, in the weather, the Sun, in his own Am\nple\nnature, is the fountain of light andheat; but, beingjoined with Saturn,\nnever fails, if not prevented by fom\ne other apparent caufe, both in win\u00ad\nter an\nd fum\nm\ner, to produce cold and cloudy weather. But, ifM\nars hap\u00ad\npens to bejoined in configuration with them, the cafe is altered, and,\ninflead of cold, the w\neather will not fail, in fum\nm\ner, to be hot and ful-\ntry, though at the fam\ne tim\ne cloudy, corrufcuous, and diforderly; and,\nin winter, rem\narkably clofe and warm\n, though lowering and turbulent;\nm\nore efpecially if attended with a new or full Moon. Thefe are fads\nfounded upon a rational hypothefis, and proved by long experience and\nconftant obfervation.\nThefe prelim\ninaries being laid down, and confidered as the ground\u00ad\nwork ofAftrology, it follows that thofe, who would wifh to be proficient\nin it, fhould learntopredid futurities after a natural way, by fuch prefei-\ncnce as nature has pointed out, and not by an inconfiderate or vain opi\u00ad\nnion that this fiiall happen, becaufe it hath m\nany great and efficient\ncaufes which it is im\npofiible to refift; or that this (hall not happen,\nbecaufe it hath refilling affeftions, Calculators of nativities, therefore,\nwhen they fpeak of thofe things which m\nay com\ne to pafs, can do it in\nno other way, conform\nable to truth and nature, but by the power and\neffects of the circum\nam\nbient m\natter or afpe&s, which, being m\nore or\nlefs inclined to atem\nperature, will produce fuch an accident, fta-\nture of body, or difpofition of m\nind. As when a phyfician aiferts that\nanulcer will eat away or putrefy, or a naturalift that the loaditone will\nattract iron ; not becaufe it is neceffary that the ulcer ihould eat away\nor putrefy, or the loaditone attract; but, if the contraries are not known\nnor their effects prevented, thefe circum\nitances will affuredly happen,\naccording to the caufe and confequences of things, as \u2018they have been\nfrom the beginning of the world. Thus it happens, and thus we ought\ntpjudge, inthe calculation of nativities; for thofe events which per\u00ad\npetually tall in upon all hum\nan affairs, are produced according to the\nlucceffion of natural order, either becaufe things that m\nay oppofe and\nprevent\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 397\nprevent are not found, or becaufe they are not known. And again,\nevents known naturally, and according to order, and thofe things being\nfoundwhich difagree and oppofe, they are then either wholly prevented,\nor elfe come to pafs with very fm\nall effe\u00a3t, and are fcarcely vifible in\ntheir operation.\n\u2022\nNow, feeing there is both in generals and particulars fuch a confe-\nquence, it is curious to rem\nark, that though m\nany people believe in\ngenerals, andallow it is poffible to prognosticate upon that fyftem\n, and\nalfo think it advantageous tow\nards prefervation and health ; yet in par\u00ad\nticulars they will not allow the fam\ne operations to have any force. .For\nm\nany confefs they know the proper feafons, and the ligniiication of the\nfixed S\ntars, and the afpe&s of the Moon, and they obferve them for the\nestablishm\nent of their health, and to reduce their constitutions to a good\nand regular tem\nperature, in fum\nm\ner by cooling m\nedicam\nents, and in\nwinter by heating. They alfo obferve the Significations of the fixed\nStars, for thepurpofes of navigation; and they plant, and fow, and for\u00bb\nward vegetation, by obferving the different afpedts of the Moon j and\nno one fuppofes thefe general effects either im\npofiible or ufelefs. But\nin particulars, a\ns of cold or heat, which increafe and decreafe in their\nproper tem\nper, and by the properties and m\nixtures of other m\natter, they\nneither believe it poffible to foretel, or conceive that we m\nay be pre-\nferved from\n, the confequences attending them\n. But the caufe of this\nopinion, is the difficulty of knowing particulars, and the m\nanagem\nent\nof them\n, with precision and truth ; and becaufem\nenare feldom found of\nfo penetratinga com\nprehension, that none of the contraries be hidden\nfrom their view; hence, the oppoiing power of influence for the moil\npart not beingjoinedwith a foreknowledge in the effe:t produced by firfl\ncaufes without im\npedim\nent, they judge of things fimply, a\ns though\nim\nm\nutable and im\npoflible to be prevented. But as in the art of predic\u00ad\ntion its poffibility appears worthy of consideration, although it is not\naltogether infallible, this prefervative part is certainly worthy of parti\u00ad\ncular regard, Sin\nce it m\nay bring relief to m\nany, though not aperfect cure\ntoall. For this reafon the Egyptians, finding the efficacy of this art,\nevery wherejoined phyiic to prognostic aftronom\nyj and hence it is ap\u00ad\nparent, that, if they had thought futurities could not be rem\noved or di\u00ad\nverted, they would never have preferibed certain rem\nedies and perferva-\ntives againit the effeft of the am\nbient, prefent or to com\ne, whether in\ngeneral or particular cafes ; they therefore fought out a m\nethod at once\nadvantageous an\nd profitable, that by aitrology the quality of the fubja-\ncent tem\nperam\nents, and the accidents which com\ne to pafs by the influ\u00ad\nence of the heavenly bodies, might be difeovered and known; but\ni the\n\f398 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe m\nedical art, to diftingtiifh the fim\npathies and antipathies of each,\nend to underfland the natural cure of prefent difeafes, and the true\nm\node of preferration from future. For without this fpecies of aftro-\nnom\nrc knowledgethe m\nedical art is foundin m\nany cafes to fail j though\nI amready to allowthat there are not rem\nedies to be found for all bodies\nanddifeafes. -\n*\nThefe obfervations becom\ne clear and obvious, from a confideration\nof the planets and their afpe\u00e9fs. The Sun is found by nature to caufe\nheat and drinefs in a m\noderate degree. His power and influence is moll\nviftble to our fenfes, by reafon of his m\nagnitude, and the m\nanifeft mu\u00ad\ntation of the feafons\u00a1 for, by how much the nearer he approaches to\nour vertical point, by fo m\nuch the m\nore he ftirs up heat in us, and\nfubjetls us tohis nature. But the nature of the Moon is chiefly moift-\ncnirtg; for, being n\nearer theearth, ihe exhales the vapours of all m\noift\nbodies, and thus evidently affc\u00e9ts all m\noift things, and putrefies them;\nbur, becaofe of her analogy with the Sun, Ihe m\noderately participates of\nheat. The planet Saturn cools anddries, becaufe he is far diftant from\nthe heatof theSun and vapours of the earth; but he cools mod abun\u00ad\ndantly, and dries moil m\noderately. The other planets alio receive\nvirtue according to the configurations- they m\nake with the Sun and\nMoon. M\nars drieth much, and burns, becaufe of his hot and fiery na\u00ad\nture; but the influence of Jupiter is tem\nperate, becaufe he m\noves be\u00ad\ntween the coldnefs of Saturn and the heat of Mars. Venus hath nearly\nthe fam\ne tem\nperature, but in a different m\neafure, becaufe of her vicini\u00ad\nty to the Sun ; ihe m\noiftens moil, as does the Moon, through the great-\nnefs of their light, by which they afiiim\ne them\noiiture of the vapours of\nthe earth. Mercury fom\netim\nes dries, and fom\netim\nes m\noiftens, according\nto his poiition and configuration with other ilars. Hence arife the four\nprincipal hum\nours, from whence all bodies are engendered. Two of\nthem aregenerative andactive, thehot, andthem\noift ; for by thefe are\nall things joined together, and increafcd; and two are corruptive and\nhurtful; the dry, and the cold; for by thefe all things are difiblved,\nanddeftroyed. W\nherefore twoof theplanets, viz. JupiterandVenus, arc\ndefined to be benefics, becaufe of their benevolent tem\nperature, and\nbecaufe heat and m\noiilure equally abounds in them; and likewise the\nMoon, for the fam\ne reafons. But Saturn andMars, being of an oppo-\niite nature, are defined to be ofam\nalevolent anddeilrudive influence, by\nreafon of theextrem\ne cold of theone, and the violent heat of the other.\nBut the Sun and Mercury, being of a controvertible nature, are found to\nproduce both thefeinfluences, accordingto thenature, force, and quality,\nof theafpefts orconfigurations they m\nake withother bodies.\nAs\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y , S9q\nAs there a\nrefour diftin\u00e2 hum\nours or qualities incident tpthe planets,\nfo a\nretheretwo prim\nary fexes by which they a\nre diftinguifheg, qapaely,\nthe m\nafeuline an\nd the fem\ninine.

The day, becaufeof its h\neat an\ndactivity, is term\ned\nm\nasculine -, an\nd the n\nigh\nt# becaufe of its m\noifture, an\nd conveniencyfor\nreflffem\ninine ; therefore the M\noon\u00bfad.Venus are no\u00fburnal, an\nd the\nSun an\ndJupiter diurnal ; but M\nercury isin this refpeft alfoindifferent,\ndiurnal w\nhen in an oriental fituation, an\nd no\u00e2urnal w\nhen occidental.\nBut thetwo m\nalevolent planets, Saturn an\nd M\nars, a\nre con\nfidered diur\u00ad\nn\nal a\nn\nd nodturn\nal, not according to their quality an\nd nature, a\ns heat to\nheat, but contrary; for agood tem\nperam\nent, taking its like, m\naketh\nthe goodgreater ; an\nd unlike, m\nixed with evil, deftroys m\nuch of that\nevil ; therefore Saturn, a\ns cold, isjpined to the h\neat of the day ; an\nd\nM\nars, a\ns dry* to the m\npiilure of the night. Soeachofthem\n, becom\ning\nm\noderate in their influences, will appear confonant to the conditions\nwhich givethe tem\nperam\nent.

Thus the pow\ner of thefe va\u00ad\nrious\n* The rifing and letting of the liars are threefold ; cofmical, achromcal, and heliacal.\nCofmical riling is, whena itar or planet aieends the horizon with the lame degree and m\ni*\nNo. 2\n0\n. 5D n\nu\nte\n\f[0\n0 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n4\n\u25a0 io\nu\ns affe&ions, being mixed among them\nfelves, produces m\nany diffe\u00ad\nrences of quality in the circumambient m\natter which continually fur-\nrounds us} the proper and diftinct power of which, alternately prevail\u00ad\ning, is changed m\nore or lefs by the force of other configurations. To\nthefeeffects, the operation of the fixed ftars in general contaibute not a\nlittle. Thofe of the greateft m\nagnitude are the moil powerful and ef\u00ad\nficacious ; and thofe inor near the ecliptic havem\nore energy than thofe\nrem\note from it. The bright ftars have m\nore influence than the dull\nand languid ; thofe of a red colour partake of the quality of M\nars ;\nthofe af a lead colour operate with fim\nilar effect to Saturn ; and fo of\nthe others, according to their affinitywith the planets, as hath been al\u00ad\nready explained. Stars which have northern latitude and declination!\naffed us moil; and with South Latitude, the m\nore fouthern. Thofe\nfituated in the zenith influence m\nore than thofe which are m\nore re\n-^\nm\note ; and fuch as are in partile conjunction or antifcion of any plAet,!\nor which rife or fet, or culminate, with any planet, have a m\nore than\nordinary power and influence : but of them\nfelves the fixed ftars emit no\nrays. v. \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 , \u2022 \u2022\nThe four angles of the horofcope, or cardinal houfes of heaven, from\nwhence the general winds take their rife, muil likewife be confidered.\nThe oriental angle is pofleffed of great \u00bfrinefs; for, when the Sun ar\u00ad\nrives there, thofe things which werem\noiftenedby thenight beginto dryj\nand the winds which blowfrom thence, commonly calledeaft-winds, are\nvery drying, and without m\noifture. The angleof tbefouth is moil hot,\nbecaufe the Sun, being there culminate, burns and heats with greater\nenergy, becaufe our m\nid-heaven declines to the fouth wherefore the\nwinds proceeding from thence, commonly called fouth-winds, are hot\nand filling. But the occidental angle is moift, becaufe, when the Sun\narrives there, thofe things which were dried in the day begin to be\nm\noiftened j confequently the winds blowing from thence, commonly\ncalled weft-winds, are free from thicknefs or m\noifture. The northern\nangleorpoint, lying towards the Bears, is moil cold, becaufethe culmi\u00ad\nnatingSun, inrefpect to that part of the earth which we inhabit, declines\nm\noft fromit ; for which rtafon, the winds blowing from that quarter\nare generally cold and freezing. The perfed knowledge of thefe things\nis very neccffary toenable us to diftinguifh themixtureof particularsj for\n\u2019 it\nfiuteo\nfthe ecliptic in which the Sun is; and cofmical fetting is, whenaftar or planet lets exa&ly\nwhen the Sun rifes. Achronical rifing is, whenaftar rifes above the horizonat Sun fetting ; and\nachromcal fetting is, when a ftar fets with the Sun. Heliacal rifing is. when a ftar, which before\nhidden by the rays of the Sun, begins toappear inthe eaft ;andheliacal fetting is, when a ftar,\nwhich beforewas fecn, hiddenunder the Sun-beams, and difappears.\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 401\nit is apparent, that, according to the conftitution of the feafons, of ages,\nand of the angles, the efficient power and influence of the ftars varyj\nand, when there is no contrary conftitution, the ftars have a longer\ninfluence, becaufe it isunm\nixed j for, in heating, they that arem\nofthot\nare m\noft powerful j and, in m\noift conftitutions, thofe arethe m\noft pow\u00ad\nerful which are ofi a moiftening nature. But, when the conftitution is\ncontrary, they are weaker, by reafon of the tem\nperam\nentand mixture of\ncontrariety, affe&ed by the heating ftars in cold conftitutions, and by\nthe m\noift in dry. In the fam\ne m\nanner each of the other conftitutions\nhave power, according to the proportions of their m\nixtures. To thefe\nwe m\nay join the m\nutual properties of the twelve figns of the zodiac ;\nfor their general tem\nperatures areagreeable to the feafons fubjeft to each\nfign ; and they obtain fom\ne other qualities ariflng from their analogy to\nthe Sun, Moon, and ftars ; and thefe confiderations of the agreem\nent or\ndifagreementof the natures and m\nixtures of the various influences of the\nftars, figns, and parts of heaven, are of no fm\nall confequence in aftrolo-\ngical contem\nplations.\nOf the twelve figns, fom\ne are term\ned tropics, fom\ne equino&ial, fom\ne\nfixed, and others bicorporal. The tropics are two; the firft from the\nfum\nm\ner folftice, the thirty degrees of Cancer ; and the other from the\nwinter folftice, the thirty degrees of Capricorn. Thefe are called tro\u00ad\npics, becaufe, when the Sun is pofited in the beginning of thefe figns, he\nturns back out of the courfe of latitude or declination to the contraries,\nmaking fum\nm\ner by his entering into Cancer, and winter by his paffage\ninto Capricorn. There are alfo two of the figns equinodtial; one from\nthe vernal equinox, which is Aries ; the other from the autum\nnal\nequinox, which is Libra. Thefe arc foterm\ned, becaufe, whenevever the\nSun enters the beginning of them, he m\nakes the days and nights equal\nall the world over.\nOf the other eight figns, four arefixed and four bicorporal. The fixed\nare thofe which follow the tropical and equinoHial ; becaufe, when the\nSun is pofited in any of thefe, the cold or heat, or drinefs or moif-\nture of the feafons, which began while the Sun w\nas in the tropics or\neqninodtials, m\nore ftrongly affeH\ns us, and the conftitution of the fea\u00ad\nfons is m\nore forcibly felt ; not becaufe their condition is naturally fuch,\nbut becaufe we, being no longer under fuchaconftitution, becom\ne m\nore\nfenfible of its power. The bicorporal follow the fixed ; and, becaufe\nthey arebetween the fixed and the tropics, they partake of the nature of\nboth conftitutions.\n1 Again,\n\f404 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nAgain, fix of the twelve figns are nam\ned m\nafculine gild diurnal ; and\nfix fem\ninine and nofiurnal. And becaufe the night isalways next to\nthe day, and the fem\ninine is joined to the mafculine, they are placed\none after another by turns. The beginning is taken from Aries, be\u00ad\ncaufe the m\noiilure of the fpring is the beginning of the feafons; and\nbecaufe the m\nafculine virtue is predom\ninant, and the adtivepower before\nthe paffive ; therefore the figns Aries and Libra are efteem\ned mafcu-\nJine and diurnal; for thefe defcribe the equinodtial circle ; and the prim\ne\nm\nutation, and ftrongeft m\notion of allj is caufed by them. The other\nfigns are alternately placed one after another in their proper order ; and,\nfromthe formandquality of them, fom\ne are term\ned four-footed, others\nterrcilrial; fom\ne commanding, and others fruitful. And, to renewthem\nin the m\nind of the reader, it m\nay not be im\nproper to diflinguiih them\nhere. Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquaries, are m\naf\u00ad\nculine andcommanding. Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn,\nand Pifces, are fem\ninine and obeying. Aries, Taurus, Leo, Sagittarius,\nand Capricorn, are four-footed. Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, are\nterreftrial. Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifces, are fruitful. Again, Aries,\nCancer, Libra, and Capricorn, are term\ned m\noveable. Taurus, Leo,\nScorpio, and Aquaries, fixed. Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pifces,\ncom\nm\non. Aries, Taurus, and Gemini, vernal. Cancer, Leo, and\nVirgo, eilival. Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius, autum\nnal. Capricorn,\nAquaries^ and Pifces, hyem\nnal. Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, are hot,\ndry, andfiery. Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, are cold, dry, and earthy.\nGemini, Libra, andAquaries, are hot, moiit, and airy. Cancer, Scorpio,\nPifces, Gemini, and Leo, aremoiil and watery j and Virgo is barren.\nNow from this difpofition and tem\nperature of the figns are brought\nabout the great ends and purpofes of nature, by m\neans of the afpedis and\npofitions of the planets configurated in them and it is upon thefe\nafpedts and configurations that the art of predidting is grounded, and\nthe events of futurity fought out and known. Thefe afpedts are of two\nforts, or claffcs, viz. zodiacal and m\nundane. The principal zodiacal\nafpedts arethe fextile, quartile, trine,_\nandoppofition ; and, though the\nconjundtion cannot properly \"b\ne term\ned an afpedt, yet it m\nay com\ne un\u00ad\nderthe m\noregeneral nam\ne of a familiarity, com\nm\non to all the afpedts.\nThe conjundtion is form\ned by two planets being bodily joined, orm\neet\u00ad\ning in the fam\nedegree andm\ninute of a fign. The fextile is form\ned by\ntwo planets when they are two figns, or fixty degrees, afunder; the\nquartile, when three figns, or ninety degrees, afunder ; the trine, when\nfour figns, or one hundredand twenty degrees, afunder; and the oppo\u00ad\nfition, when fix figns, or one hundred and eighty degrees, aiunder ;\nwhich\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 403\nwhich being juft one half of the great circle, places the planets exa&ly\nfacing one another. The fm\naller or inferior zodiacal afpe&s are the\nfem\niquadrate of forty-five degrees; the quintile, of feventy-two degrees;\nthe fefquiquadrate, of one hundred and thirty-five degrees; and the\nbiquintile, of onehundred and forty-four degrees. And thefe are either\npartite or platic; partile, when the conjunction or afpeft is m\nade in\nthe fam\ne degree and m\ninute, and platic when not configurated in the\nfam\ne degreeand m\ninute, but only within the orbs of the afpefting pla\u00ad\nnet. M\noreover, thefe afpefts are either dexter o\nr iinifter; dexter, when\ncontrary to the fuccefiion of the figns, a\ns a planet in Leo calls a fpxtile\ndexter to another planet in Taurus. Sinifter afpeits are according to\nthe fuccefiion of the figns; agreeable to which, a planet in Aries calls\nhis trine finifter toanother in Leo; or one in Leo calls a trine finiller\nto another in Sagittarius.\nM\nundane afpedls are thofe which are m\nade in the m\neridional circle,\nin reference to the earth, and confill of only the fextile, quartile, trine,\nand oppofition; though there are other fam\niliarities which w\ne call pa\u00ad\nrallels, an\nd thefe both m\nundane and zodiacal. Of thefe fam\niliarities,\nthe conjunction is good with benevolent liars; but with m\nalevolent bad.\nThe quintile, biquintile, fextile, and trine, arealfo good and fortunate;\nbut the fem\niquadrate, fefquiquadrate, quartile, and oppofition, are evil\nand unfortunate. Thefe good an\nd evil influences proceed m\nore from the\nnature an\nd quality of the ilars, than from the nature of the figns they\npoflefs; for it is found that evengoodafpe6lsof m\nalefic planets will pro\u00ad\nduce m\nifehief, though not in fogreat adegree a\ns the evil configurations.\nZodiacaL-parallels are what are com\nm\nonly called Antifcians, and are\nnothing m\nore than parallels of declination, or two points in the hea\u00ad\nvens at equal dillances from the beginning of any of the tropics, or\nequinoctial points. For example; one planet in ten degrees of Aries,\nand another in twenty degrees of Pifccs, are in zodiacal parillel to each\nother; or, in other words, one planet in twenty degrees of PiIces calls\nits antifeian, or one parallel, to ten degrees of Aries, an\nd its contra-anti-\nfeian, or another parallel, to tendegrees of Libra. But, in taking thefe,\nparticular attention mud behadto eachof the planets latitude, for want\nof which, great errors have been frequently m\nade. For, fuppofe the\nMoon to be polited in twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with five degrees\nof north latitude, her antifeian, or zodiacal parallel, taken in the com\n\u00ad\nm\non way, would fall in eight degrees of Leo, an\nd her contra-ancifcian\nin eight degrees of Aquanes; w\nhereas the true antifeian falls in ten\ndegrees of Cancer, which is no lefs than twenty-eight degrees fromthat\nNo. 20. 5 E obtained\n\f4\u00a9\n4 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nobtained in the com\nm\non way, for there is exa&ly that difference be*\ntween the ecliptical longitude of twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with*\nout latitude, and twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with five degrees of\nnorth latitude.\nA planet thus confidered, as having latitude, hath four zodiacal paral- t\nIds} oneat its body, one at its antifcional point, and the other two at '\ntheir oppofite points. And hence, according to the exam\nple above\nftated, the Moon\u2019s parallels at her body fall in twenty degrees of Ge\u00ad\nmini, and at the antifcional point in ten degrees- of Cancer; an\nd their\noppofite points orcontra*antifeians, fall in twenty degrees of Sagitta-\nrious, and in ten degrees of Capricorn. Thefe antifeians, and contra-\nantifcians, are always of a benign and friendly nature, when form\ned by\nthe benefic planets j but they areequally unbenignandunfortunate, when\nm\nade by violent andm\nalevolent ftars.\nAs zodiacal parallels are only equal difiances from the tropical and\nequinoftial circles, fo m\nundaneparallels, by a parity of reafon, are no\u00ad\nthing m\nore than a like equal diftance from the horizontal or.m\neridional\npoints or. circles. For exam\nple, a planet on the cufp of the twelfth\nhoufe is inparallel tothe cufp of the fecond. houfe, becaufe it is cxa&ly\nat the fam\ne diftance from the afeendant or horizon that the twelfth is;\nqn\nd likewife in parallel to the eighth houfe, as being exa&ly the fam\ne\ndiftance fromthe tenth houfe or m\neridian that the twelfth is. And, as\nthe zodiacal parallels are m\neafured by the circle of the zodiac, fo the\nm\nundane parallels arem\neafured by the diurnal of nofturnal arches; for\njuft fo long a\ns the Sun or any other planet will be in proceeding from\nthe cufp of the twelfth houfe to the cufp of the tenth, juft fo long the\nfam\ne Sun orother planet will be in proceeding, on the fam\ne day, from\nthe cufpof the tenth to the cufpof the eighth houfe; andjuft fo m\nany\nhours and m\ninutes of tim\ne as there are betw\neen the fun-rifing and noon,\njuft fom\nany hours and m\ninutesare there, the fam\neday, betw\neen noonand\nfun-fetting; hencethe diftaq.eebetw\neen the.Sun\u2019s riling and fetting isno\u00ad\nthing but the diurnal arch, which the m\neridian^'or Sun\u2019s placeat noon,\ncuts into two equal partsj and the diftance between the Sun\u2019s fettingand\nrifing conftitutes the nodurnal arch. Thefe m\nundane parallels have a\ntwo-fold conftderationindiredions; firft fim\nple, and according to natural\norder; an\nd fecondly, accordingto the rapt motion oftheearth, or prim\num\nm\nobile, both ofwhichm\nuft beattendedtointhecalculation of nativities.\nNow there are figns diffociateand-ieparate; and thefe are fuch as\nhave nofam\niliarity by any of the ways before m\nentionedj for they nei\u00ad\n. ther\n\fO f A S T R O L O G Y . - 40J\nth.tr c\no\nm\nm\na\nn\ndn\no\nrobey, nor mutually behold each other, n\no\nr are of\n\u00abqual power; but they areconfigurated by one or five figns, and dp not\nat all partake of the afpedts, either by oppofition, trine, quartile, or\nTextile. Hence they are term\ned injuB ', for, beingconfigurated by one\nfign\u2019s diftance, they areas it were diftorted from each other; and thofe\nwhich behold by five figns divide the whale circle of the zodiac into\nunequal parts. The figns under this defeription, are Aries, Gemini,\nLibra, andSagittarius, which have no fam\niliarity or afpefts with Taurus\nor Scorpio; and the figns, Cancer, Virgo, Capricorn, and Pifces, have\nnofam\niliarity with Leoor Aquaries. *\nBut the planets h\n.ave fam\niliarity with all parts of the zodiac by\nHoufes, Trigons, Exaltations, andTerms. Cancer an\ndLeo, approaching\nnearer to our vertical point than either of the others, and thereby pro\u00ad\nducing heat and warm\nth, are for that reafon defined to be the houfes of\nthe two great and prim.ry luminaries: Leo is attributed to the Sun as\nm\nafeuline, and Cancer to the Moon a\ns fem\ninine. Hence the fem\ni\u00ad\ncide!c of the zodiac from Leo to Capricorn is term\ned folar, an3 from\nAquaries to Cancer lunar, in order that each planet ihould poflefs one\nfign for its houfe in each ofits fem\nicircles ; the one bearingconfiguration\nto the Sun, and the other to the Moon, according to the m\notion of the\nfphereof each, and to their natural qualities. Saturn, therefore,, being\nin nature .cold, and inim\nical to.heat, occupying the~higheft orb, and\nbeing at the greatell difiance fromthe lum\ninaries, takes for his houfes\nthe ligns which are oppofite to Cancer and Leo, nam\nely, Aquaries and\nCapricorn, becaui'e thefe figns are by nature cold and wintery, and the\nafpetis which are m\nade by oppofition do not com\nbine to.any good or\nbenevolent purpofe. Jupiter, becaufe his orb is next below that of\nSaturn, afT\nu\nm\nes for bis houfes the two next figns, Sagittanus and.Pifcee,\nwhich are windy andfruitful, by reafon of their trigonal refpect to the\nlum\ninaries, which is a fituation proper for the produdtion of go\no\nd\n\u00ab\n*\nMars, being next fa order to Jupiter, and dry by m\nature, takes for his\nhoufes the two next figns, Ariesand Scorpio, which are fim\nilar in their\netifed\nts to Mars, by having m\nalefic and m\nifehievous radiations with the\nlum\ninaries. Venus, being tem\nperate, has for her houfes the two n\nex-t\nfigns, Taurus and Libra, which are of a fruitful and prolific nature,\nand correfpond with the lum\ninaries by a Textile fay, and is never m\nore\nthan two figns diftantfromthe Sun. Mercury, being circumfcribcd by\ntheorbs of all theother planets, takes for his houfes Gemini and Virgo,\nand is never m\nore than one fign diftant fromthe central Sun, being the\nfirft planet next him.\nThe\n\f4o6 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nThe fam\niliarities by triplicity are next to beconlidered by calculators\nof nativities; for w\nhereas a triplicity and figure of equal fides obtains\nan agreem\nent, fo the circle of the zodiac is circum\nscribed by three\ncircles, the equinoctial and the two tropics, and is divided into four\nequilateral triangles, which conftitute thefe triplicities. The firft is\nform\ned by the three m\nafeuline figns, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; and\nit has for its lords, the Sun, Jupiter, and Mars; but M\nacs being of a\ncontracyjua.tU\nT5JtQ\n- tbe,X\n9)\n3piflflucnce>he is excluded from bearing any\ngovernment in this triplicity, and therefore the Sun has the rule by\nday, and Jupiter by night. Aries occupies the equinottial circle, Leo\nthe eftival, and Sagittarius the winter. This trigon is principally\nnorthern^by re^\nfon of the dom\ninion of Jupiter; and it is windy and\nfruitful. It is alfo north-weft, and receives^am\nixture of the north-weft\nwinds, becaufe it is the houfe of Mars, whichplanet ftirs up and governs\nthofe winds.\nThe fecond triplicity, which confifts of Taurus, Virgo, and Capri\u00ad\ncorn, is under the governm\nent of the Moon and Venus. The Moon\ngoverns by night, and Venus by day. Taurus is in the eftival circle,\nVirgo in the equino&ial, and Capricorn in the winter. This triplicity,\nbecaufe of the dom\ninion of Venus, isJouth; for this ftar, being endued\nwith a warm\ning and moiftening power, produces fouth winds; and be\u00ad\ncaufe Saturn has his houfe in Capricorn, in this triplicity, it likewife\npartakes of a m\nixtureof the eaft winds ; for Saturn, being fam\niliar tothe\noriental parts, by reafon of the condition of the Sun, produces and go\u00ad\nverns the eaft winds.\nThe thirdtriplicity is form\nedof the figns Gemini, Libra, and Aqua-\nries, three m\nafeuline figns, and is placed under the governm\nent of\nSaturn and Mercury; Saturn rules by day, and Mercury by night;\nGemini is fituate in the fum\nm\ner circle, Libra in the equinoctial, and\nAquaries in the winter. This triplicity is chiefly eaftern, on ac\u00ad\ncount of the governm\nent of Saturn; but it becom\nes partly north-eaft,\nby the influence of Jupiter, onwhich account it afium\nes a m\nixture of the\nnorth-eaft winds.\nThe fourth triplicity, confifting of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifccs, is\nchiefly under Mars, who derives an influence here, on account of\nhaving his houie in Scorpio; but, becaufe the figns in this triplicity are\nfem\ninine, the M\noon by night, and Venus by day, rule jointly with\nMars, and interm\nix their qualities and influence together. Cancer is\nfituate in the eftival circle, Scorpio in the winter, and Pifces in the\n3 equinoctial.\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 407\nThis triplicity is weftern, becaufe of the dom\ninion of M\nars and .the\nMoon ; but, affirm\ning a m\nixture by the rule of Venus, it becom\nes in\nfornem\neafure fouth-well.\nThe fam\niliarities by exaltation are thus occafioned ; the Sun, when\nhe enters Aries, m\nakes his tranfit into the high and northern fem\nicircle ;\nbut, when he enters Libra, he palfes into the low and fouthern femicir\u00ad\ncle. For this reafon, the Sun has his exaltation in Aries, in which the\ndays beginto lengthen, and the heating nature of the Sun begins to in-\ncreafe; andfor the contrary reafon he receives his fall in Libra. Saturn,\nbeingof an oppoiite nature to the Sun, has anexaltation in Libra\u2019\n, and\nhis fall in Aries; for, wherefoever heat is increafed, cold is diminiihed ;\nand, where there is an augm\nentation of cold, heat is lefiened. So the\nMoon, becaufe Ihe m\nakes her conjunction with the Sun in Aries, and\nm\nakes the beginning of the increafe of her light in the full fign of her\ntriplicity, which is Taurus, that is aifigned for her exaltation. So Ju\u00ad\npiter, the producer of northern and fruitful winds, when in Cancer, be\u00ad\ncom\nes m\nore northerly, and acquires a greater increafe of power ; he\ntherefore takes Cancer for hisexaltation, and Capricornforhis fall. And\nfince M\nars is chiefly of a burning nature, and becom\nes moll heating in\nCapricorn, becaufe he is then in his moftfouthern declination, he hath\nhis exaltation in Capricorn, oppoiite to that of Jupiter, and his fall in\nCancer. Again, Venus is naturally moillening, but moftly fo when in\nPifces \u2022, for which reafon ihe affum\nes her exaltation in that fign, and\ntakes herfall in Virgo. But Mercury being of an oppofite nature, and\nmoftly dry, takes the oppofite fign Virgo for his exaltation ; forthen\nautum\nn, the drieft partof the feafon, appears; and he has his fall inthe\nfign Pifces.\nFam\niliarities by term\ns have been already largely explained in the\nform\ner part of this work. But it is neceflary to rem\nark, that the be\u00ad\nginning of the figns, andof the term\ns alfo, ought to be m\nade from the\nbeginning of the equino&ial andtropical figns; and this is manifeil, be\u00ad\ncaufe we fee their natures, and powers, and fam\niliarities, have not any\nother caufe, but from the tropics and equinoxes ; for, if other begin'\nnings are appointed, we ihall either be neceflitated to ufe the nature of\nthe figns.no longer in the theory of judgments, or, if w\nedoadm\nit them\n,\nwe Ihall commit error by corrupting the diftances, and dividing thofe\nfrom which influences are afforded them\n.\nBcfides thefe fam\niliarities of the liars and figns, they alfop\nolT\nefs what\narecalled their faces, thrones, and the like. Their properface is when\nNo. 20. 5 F each\n\f4o8 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\neach ilarkeeps the fam\nefigure with theSun and Moon which its houfe\nbears to their houfe. This is done when Venus m\nakes a fexangular\nfigure to the luminaries; to the Sun w\nhen ihe is occidental, and to\nthe M\noon when oriental, according to the fucceflion of houfes. They\narealfo faid to be intheir thrones, when they have apower in the place\nthey poffefs,-according to the foregoing prerogatives, by two or m\nore\nteftim\nonies; for then their energy and influences are increafed, becaufe\nthefam\niliarity of theam\nbient twelve figns co-operates therewith. They\nare likewifefaid tobein theirjoy, when, although they have no fami\u00ad\nliarity with the am\nbient figns, yet are fo in refped to others of the fam\ne\ncondition with them\n, an\nd by which likenefs there is found a com\nm\nuni\u00ad\ncation by fym\npathy. So again, w\nhen they are found of an unlike and\ncontrary condition, m\nuch of their pow\ner is dim\ninifhed by a new and\nm\nixed virtue arifing from the different tem\nperature of the am\nbient figns.\nHence let it be underftood, that, when Mercury is one fign diftant from\nthe Sun, he is in his face ; Venus, when two figns diftant; Jupiter,\nwhen four figns diftant ; an\nd Saturn, when five figns from the Sun.-\u2014\nThe fam\ne observation holds good in refped of the Moon, but then the\nrule mud be m\nade in figns antecedent to her ; as, if the Moon w\nere in\nVirgo, then Mercury would befo dignified in Leo, Venus in Cancer,\nM\nars in Gemini, &c. The thrones of the planets are thefe : Saturn\u2019s\nthrone isinAquaries ; Jupiter\u2019s in Sagittarius; Mars\u2019s in Scorpio ; the\nSun\u2019sinLeo; Venus\u2019s in Taurus; Mercury\u2019s in Virgo; and the Moon\u2019s\nin Cancer.\nThe fam\niliarities, by application andfeparation, are likewife tobecon-\nfidered in the Dodrine of Nativities. Thofe planets which precede\napply to thofe which follow ; an\nd they that follow feparate fromthofe\nwhich precede. Thefe applications an\nd reparations arc likewife to be\nconfidercd with refped to their latitude ; for the fm\naller the latitude of\nplanets in conjundion is, the m\nore powerful will be their influence ;\nand, if two planets in conjunction have confiderable latitude of different\ndenom\ninations, their influence will be thereby much leffened. This\nobfervation likewife holds good in directions; for, the n\nearer any pla\u00ad\nnet is to the ecliptic line, the greater will his influence be. M\noreover,\ntheir effects are either ftrong or weak, in refped of the horizon ; for,\nw\nhen they are pofited in the m\nid-heaven, or pafs into the place fucce-\ndent to the m\nid-heaven, they are very ftrong and powerful ; the fam\ne\nalfo if they a\nrein the horizon itfelf, or in any of the fuccedent houfes,\nandm\nore particularly when inoriental parts. But, when they are inthe\nim\num tceli, or otherwife pofited under the earth, their influence .is very\nweak, and of but little effed.\n1 From\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 409\nFrom all the foregoing confiderations, it is evident that the efficient\npower of theftars is deduced from their peculiar and natural afpe&s.\nor proportional diftances, confidercd in refpeCt of the Sun, the angles,\nand the quality of the am\nbient figns; and by the power and influence of\nthefe afpeits are all aftrological fpeculations governed. But how thefe\nafpects were firftdifcovered, and theirvirtues andproportions afcertained,\ndoes no where appear.; though it might be no difficult talk to account\nfor both upon pnilofophical and m\nathem\natical principles, fince nature\nevery where, as well in the m\notions and effeCls of the heavenly bodies,\na\ns iu all other arithm\netical and geom\netrical rcfpe&s, particularly cele\u00ad\nbrates thofe proportions above all others; Picus, fpeaking ofthe afp\ne\u2019Cts,\nthinks m\nankind w\nere led to the knowledge of them by obferving the\ndifferent phafes of the Moon ; for, when the is new, horned, in her\nquarters, gibboffity, or at full, her form\ns are ftill changed at thefe\nproportioneddiftances from the Sun ; befides which, it is tobe obferved,\nthat in her annual revolutions (he is conftantly found about the trine of\nher own place in the beginning of the form\ner year.\nOther aftronom\ners, of eftabliffied reputation, have likewife obferved,\nthat nature particularly points to every configuration, while w\ne confider\nthe m\notions of the other planets. Abohazer judicioufly affirm\ns, that\nthe two inferior planets, in their ftations, deferibe the arch proper to a\nquartile afpeft ; and Pliny alfo recom\nm\nends to our obfervation the trine\nafpeCt, conftantly form\ned by the ftations of three fuperior planets.\nBut, above all, it cannot be confidered without great adm\niration, how\nwonderfully nature hath nobilitated all the afpeC\nts in the m\notions of\nSaturn andJupiter. For, a\ns their conjunctions are rare, andhappen bu^\nonce in twenty-years, fo hath n\natu\nre, everm\nore difpofed thefe conjunc\u00ad\ntions in the m\noft rem\narkable parts of the zodiac, that is, in fuch figns\nonly as behold each other in an equilateral triangle inferibed. For, be\u00ad\ntweenany two great conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter, there are nine\u00ad\nteen Egyptian years, three hundred and eighteen days, and thirteen\nhours, in which fpace of tim\ne thofe planets are m\noved fromthe place\nof their form\ner conjunctions eight figns and alm\noft three degrees; which?\nexcefs of three degrees is the caufe why, aftertenconjunctions, they pafs\nfrom one triplicity to another, and one triplicity continues one hundred\nninety-eight equal years, two hundred fixty-five days, (the intercalary\nday ofevery fourth year omitted,) and ten hours. But the revolution of\nall the triplicities is finiihed only once in feven hundred ninety-four\nequal years, three hundred thirty-one days, andfixteen hours; or other-\nwife in feven hundred ninety-four Julian years, one hundred thirty-\nthreedays, and fixteen hours; which, being doubled, am\nounts to one\nthoufand\n\f410 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthoufand five hundredand eighty-eight, which num\nber of years thofe\nauthors are thought to have refpcdted who confidered the year 1588\nfrom thebirthof Chrift would prove fo fatal.\n'From hence therefore it is, and not without fufficient caufe, that\nthey are term\ned great conjun&ions, both happening rarely, and abiding\nin one triplicity a1moil two hundred years together, and not compleat-\ning all the triplicities of the zodiac in much lefs than eight hundred\nyears: confequently they have not yet gone through all the triplicities\neight tim\nes fince the beginning of the world. Neither are the other\nafpefts form\ned by thefeplanetsto pafs unnoticed; for whoever obfcrves\nwhen Saturn and Jupiter behold each other by an oppofition.or quartile\nafpect, they will evidently perceive that they \/till carry fuch a regard\nto the figns or places of their preceding and next conjunctions, a\ns ever\u00ad\nm\nore to irradiate the one an\nd the other with an oppofition, Textile,\nquartile, or trineafpect; which I think is a fufficient proof that nature\nhath allured u\ns to the confideration of the archs form\ned by thefe afpects\nin the particular m\notion of each refpective planet.\nTo confirmthe virtues an\nd effects of thefe afpects, we need only con-\nfider what phyficians are taught by experience, nam\nely, that the crifis\nof all acute difeafes has a palpable and extraordinary fympathy with\nall thele five configurations of the Moon, m\nade to her place at the be\u00ad\nginning of the difeafe. Or, a\nsafurther proof, we need only refer to\nwhat has already been faid relative to the tides, which conftantly\nobferve the m\notions of the Moon, their fpring and higheft floods al\u00ad\nways concurring with their conjunction and oppofition to the Sun, as\nthe neaps an\nd lowed tides always do to her quarters. And it is\nequally rem\narkable that the feas, in their daily ebbing and flowing upon\nevery coail, have refpect only to fuch azim\nuthal circles, as are in a\nquartile pofition whenthe Moon paffes by them\n. Again, the Sun moil ^\nevidently m\nanifefts great effects by the quartile afpect, fince he modi-*\nfies an\nd governs the viciflitudes of feafons, or four quarters of the\nyear, by his ingrefs into the four equinodtial and tropical points of\nthe zodiac.\nThe pow\ner of thefe afpects is not injudicioufly dated by Julius\nFirmicus, in thearithm\netical obfervation which he m\nakes of the num\n\u00ad\nber of figns agreeable to the afpects, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, anfwering in pro-\ngreffive ord\ner to the conjunction, Textile, quartile, trine, and oppofi-\ntion ; for thefe num\nbers only, and no others, will divide the zodiac,\nconfiding of twelve figns; for which reafon he m\nakes them the only\naliquot\n\fO P A S T R O L O G Y . 4.11\naliquot parts of acircle. Ptolemy alio added not a little to the dignity\nof thefe irradiations, when he firft difcovercd the geom\netrical propor\u00ad\ntion which the fubtenfes of each of thefe archs bear in refpe\u00a3t to the)\ndiam\neter of a circle. Others again, with no lefs ingenuity, have ob-\nferved, that, am\nongft all tegular or ordinate figures that m\nay beinfcribed\nin acircle, though the fam\nebe infinite, there are none whofe fides and\nangles carryaway theprerogative at the circum\nference and centre, but\nthofe whofe fides and angles are anfw\nerable to the fubtenfes and archs\nof their afpeds. For, amongil all ordinate planes thatm\nay be infcribed,\nthereare no two whofe'fides joined together have pre-em\ninence to oc\u00ad\ncupy al'em\nicircle, but the hexagon, quadrate, and equilateral triaftgle,\nanlwering to the Textile, quartile, and trine irradiated. The fubtenfe\ntherefore of a Textile afpe6l confiils of two Tigns; and, joined to the fub\u00ad\ntenfe of a trine, com\npofed of four, being regular and equilateral, take\nup fix iigns, which is a com\nplete fem\nicircle. In like m\nanner, the\nfiaes of a quadrate infcribed, fubtending three figns, and, twice reckoned,\nalfo occupy the moiety of acircle. And what the foregoing figures are\nfaid to perform\n, either doubled orjoined together, m\nay alfo be found\nin the afpcft of oppofitionj for the diam\netrical line which paffes from\nthe place of conjundion to the oppofite point, divides acircle into two\nequal parts, a circum\nftance which cannot be found inanyother infcripts.\nFor exam\nple, the fide of a regular pentagon fubtends feventy-two de\u00ad\ngrees; of anodtagon but forty-five; the rem\naindersof which archs, viz.\none hundred and eight, and one hundred andthirty-five, degrees, are not\nfubtended by the fides ofany ordinatefigure.\nAnd thus, as the fubtenfes of thefe afpefls are the fam\ne with the fid\nes.\nof the foregoing infcripts, and only take up the circum\nference of a\ncircle; T\noit is evident, that the angles at which they concur are the\nfam\ne wherewith theordinate planes take up the whole fpace about the\ncentre. For, if we confider the angleof a Textile afpedt at theearth, it\nis all the fam\ne with that of an equilateral triangle confiding of fixty\ndegrees, an\nd contains two-thirds of a Tight angle; but fix tim\nes tw\no.\nthirds of aright angle m\nake four right angles; w\nherefore fix Textiles,\nequal to fix equilateral triangles, fill the whole fpace about a point,\nwnich is equal to four right angles. Secondly, every angle of a\nquartile is a right angle, and the fam\ne with -the angle of a rectangle\nquadrilater figure, four of which fill a wholefpace. Thirdly, the angle\nwhich two liars in a trine m\nake at thecentre of the earth, is m\neafured\nby anangle of one hundred and twenty degrees, which is equal tothe\nangle of a regular hexagon, confiding of a right angle and one-third;\nand, taken three times, m\nakes four right angles; whereof three equila-\nNo. 2i. 5 G teral\n\f12 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nteral hexagons, or three trine afpeds, alfo fill the whole fpace about the\ncentre. To thefe we m\nay likewife add the afped of oppofition; which\nconfifts of two right angles, and therefore being doubled will perform\nthe like operationwith the reft; whilft any other figure ofm\nany angles,\nhowever joined together, will either fall ihort of four right angles, or\nelle exceedthem\n. Forinftance, the angle of a pentagon contains a right\nangle and one fifth over, wherefore threefuchangles placedabout-apoint\nwill fall ihort of four right angles by two fifths of a right angle ; whilft\non the other hand four fuch angles will exceed four right angles by\nfourififths.\nThefe fpeculations therefore duly confidered, it w\nere fenfelefs to im\na\u00ad\ngine that nature hath fo m\nany ways diftinguiihed thefe rem\narkable irra\u00ad\ndiations of the ftars in vain, or adm\noniihed us to a particular regard of\nthem, by fo m\nany rare and fecret operations, as well in the m\notion of\nthe planets, a\ns in their effcfts and proportions, if they w\nere not endued\nwith m\nore force and virtue than any of the others. Hence it has given\nfcope to the ingenuity andabilities of the learned to affign a caufe, why\nthefe few configurations, above all the others, ihould be endued with\nfuch extraordinary efficacy. Nor has any reafon yet been given, with\nm\nore apparent probability, than that thefe proportions, whereof the\nafpeds arcfound to conlift, arcprecifely the fam\ne with thofc which are\nfound in harm\nonical concords; for which reafon it is fuppofed no lefs\nprobable, that the rays of the ftars inthefeproportioned distances, Ihould\npowerfully affed the m\natter of all fublunary things, by the fam\ne rule\nthat the like geom\netrical fymmetry in founds and voices ihould ftir up\nthe fenfc andpaffions of the hearer. And it is an eftabliftted obfervation\nthroughout the produdions of nature, that, where due proportion is\nnot wanting, there ihe never fails to endue all her efifeds with fuch an\nheight of perfedion, a\ns cannot but ftrike the fenfeand underftanding of\nevery obferver. And thus it is even in artificial coropolitions, and in\nmedicines; for we know thefe only to be m\noft kind and fovercign,\nwhich obferve acom\npetent fymmetry or tem\nperature of the adive and\npaffive qualities. With great propriety, therefore, and with every ap\u00ad\npearance of truth, m\noft of the learned agree with Ptolomy, that the caufe\nof this wonderful efficacy in the foregoing afpeds, proceeds in a great\nm\neafure fromharm\nonical proportion. .\nBut m\nore clearly to dem\nonftrate this fim\nilitude or affinity between\nthe proportions of the afpe6ts, andthe tike diftances obferved in mufical\nconcords, we m\nuft underftand that all harm\nony whatfoever originally\nfprings from three fuch term\ns ofnum\nbers as refped each other in fuch a\nm\nanner,\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 413\n1\nm\nanner, that their differences invariably retain the fam\ne proportion as\nis found between their extrem\nes. For inftance, in thefe three num\nbers\u00bb\n6, 4\n\u00bb 3\n\u00bb anfwering to the figns of the oppofition, trine\u00bb andquartile\nconfigurations, it is evident, if w\ne com\npare the extrem\nes with the m\nean\n\u00bb\nthat 2 will be the difference between 6 the firft, and 4 the fecond\u00bb\nnumber; and 1 is in like m\nanner between4 the m\niddle or fecond\u00bb\nand3 the third, num\nber; but 2 being double in proportion to 1\u00bb there\u00ad\nfore 6, the firft num\nber, re\nfp\ne\n<\n3 s 3, the third num\nber, with the like\nproportion. The analogy of which proportions, as before ftated, is\nfound to be the bafis of all m\nufic, ariiing wholly from thefe three\nAm\nple concording diftances,* which by m\nuficians are term\ned diapehte%\nconfifting of a ielquialter proportion, a\ns 6 to 4; or, which is all the\nfam\ne, of three or two ; diatcjjaron, com\npounded of a fefquitertia, a\ns 4\nto3; and diapafon, confifting of a double proportion, a\ns 6103, or 2 to\ni; an\ndis tir' d to the two firft diftances and proportions put together.\nFor a fefquhlter added to a fefquitertia, according to the rules of pro\u00ad\nportion, wri produce a diapafon, or double proportion, exaftly fuch as\nis found between the form\ner extrem\nes com\npared together, viz. as 6 to\n3. I11 like m\nanner, by com\nparing the diapafon with both thefe parts,\nthat is, with the icfquialter and fefquitertia, according to the cuftom\nary\nm\nanner of fupputating proportions, we are brought to the two other\ncom\npounded orimperfe'i concords, foconiiituting the five firft and na\u00ad\ntural diftances in harm\nonical founds, that, being, diverfly andjudicioufly\nvaried between them\nfelves, produce an infinite variety of ail kinds of\nm\nelody.\nAfter the fam\ne m\nanner we find it with regard to the light and in\u00ad\nfluence of the heavens. For, although there are other afpe.ts attributed\nto the ftars, both zodiacal and m\nundane, yet thefe five wereanciently, and\nareeven now, obferved as being m\noft apt to adion, andm\noft powerful in\ntheir effe&s, nam\nely, the conjun&ion, oppofition, trine, quartile, and\nTextile; an\nd there is nothing m\norecertain, than that by the barm\nonical\nm\nixture of thefe proportioned beam\ns, the generation and corruption of\nthis m\nortal world is infinitely varied and governed. W\nherefore, as the\nforce of all harm\nony, fo likewife the effectual reafonofall adtion in the\ninfluenceofthe fta\nr&\n, is properly deduced from the aforefaid fym\nraetry\nof thefe diftances. But, m\nore fully to illuftrate that the angles of the\nalpefts, com\npared between them\nfelves, concur with thefe harm\nonic pro\u00ad\nportions inm\nufic, let it be rem\nem\nbered, that ftars in an oppofite or dia\u00ad\nm\netrical aipett are disjoined by the ipacc of two right angles, which\narem\neasured with the arch of itx figns, or onehundred and eighty de-\ngiees of circumference; and that the trine, confifting of four figns, or\none\n\f4t4 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\none hundred and twenty degrees, conftitutes one right angle and. one\nthird of another; alfo, that the quartile afpedt takes up odf* entire right\nangle, and is fubtended with the archof three figns, or ninety degrees;\nand likewife that a Textile is conftituted\u2019 but of two figns, or fixty de\u00ad\ngrees, which is two thirds of a right angle. This being admitted, if\nwe now compare the two right angles of the oppofition, taken toge\u00ad\nther with the angles of the reft of the afpedts, and either thetrine placed\nbetween the oppolition and*the quartile, or the quartile between\nthe oppofition and the feknle, we ihall find either way three num\u00ad\nbers which admit all the laws of harmonic proportion, as becomes evi\u00ad\ndent by the following figures*.\n8 a o 8 o *\n;8o 120 90 180 90 60\nThe firft figure fufficiently explains itfelf; but in the fecond, let the\noppofition be compared with the Textile, and it will be found to have a\ntriple proportion to the fame, compounded of a double and fefquialter\nproportion, as diapente is with diapafon in mufic; and hence it is founcf\nno fimple or perfett afpedt, but exadlly anfwerable to B flat, the firft\nimperfedt or compounded concord in mufic, being a fixth from G fo l re\nu t; which is neverthelefs in fome refpeds efteemed perfedl, becaufe it\nbears the fame divifion, compared to Dfo l re, as the perfedt concords do;\nfor it is half a fifth, and fituate in the centre between r ut and Dfo l re.\nAgain, the Textile afpedl compared with the trine, \u00a16juft one half there\u00ad\nof, which has beenalready proved to be in a fefquialter proportion to\nthe oppofition, as D fo l re is to r ut, and therefore exactly correfponds\nwith the diapente in mufic, which I here take occafion to mention\n* Tbe firft figure proves the three concords to have three perfeit afpedts; and the fecond\n(hewsthetextile to be animperfed afpedt, agreeable to diapentecm diapafon, thatis,atriplepro\u00ad\nportion, as 60isto So.\nagain\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 4*5\nagain, bocaeftjl may hereafter allude to it when I come to fpeak of the\nnew afpecta.\/. What I have already faid will fufHce to Chew the philo-\nfophical fpeculation of thofe who have afcribed the efficacy of the pla\u00ad\nnetaryirradiation\u00ab tothe harmonical proportionswhich arefound between\nthemj and, iinee it is.obvious that thefe afpects do really hear the fame\nmutual refpect one toward\u00ab another as all harmonipal concords are found\nto retain among themfelves, what rcafon ctt be affigncd, why nature'\u00ab\noperations in the lights and influences of th\u00abheavenly bodies fhould not\nbegoverned by this fymmetry of proportion, in the fame manner as we\nfind to be univerfally admitted in the fcience of mufic ?\nBut all this ratherferves to illuflrate a fimile, and to prove that nature\nhas indeed diftinguiihed thefe proportions with extraordinary virtues\nabove any other, than to fatisfy the mind v\n\u00bb\nb\ny\n%in the infinite variety of\nfounds and lights, thefe proportions only fhould correfpond fo fweetly\nin mufic, and be m\nod: effectual in the operations of nature. Kepler,\nwith aihew of plauAbility, has endeavoured to demonflrate, that God, in\nthe creation of the world, obferved the fame proportion in the magni\u00ad\ntude and diftance of (the ccleftial fpheres that is found in the regular\nfolids which in geothetry have their origin from the ordinate planes ;\nand therefore concludes, that the motions of the heavenly bodies cor\u00ad\nrefpond moll fweetly, and co-operate moil powerfully together, when\nthe nature of fublunary things, endued, as he fuppofes, with a fenfitivc\nfaculty, apprehends and receives the beams of the liars by their con\u00ad\ncurrence at the centre of the earth ; which anfwers to the ordinate\nplanes, from whence the regularity of thefe proportions is derived, as\nthe impreifed characters of that admirable fymmetry which God is faid\nto have obferved in the creation of the world. And hence he fuppofes\nthat, as often as anyearthly fubilance meets with thefe proportions, it is\naffected as it were by this idea, and exercifed in fuch a manner, that\n. what it but ordinarily performs at other times it will now produce\nwith much moreeffect. Not that thefe proportions work any thing of\nthemfelves j for, ip mufic, it is neither the founds, nor the proportion\nof the concords, that work any thing of themfelves, or beget any de\u00ad\nlight in the hearerj but the foul, approaching tq \u00bfhe organs of fenfe,\nthere fitft entertains the founds inwardly, then regards their proportions,\nand, finding the fame good andgeometrical, lallly exhilarates itfelf, and\nmoves the body wherein it is as with an object wherein it takes delight.\nSuch |lfo is the fympathy between the heavenly influences and all fublu*\nnary matter, animate, orinsuimatc.\nNo. 21. But,\n\f416 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nBat, be this conceit of Kepler\u2019s as it may, we are not without fuffi-\ncient geometrical demonftration, to ihew the reafon why thefe propor\u00ad\ntions or irradiations of the ftars are more effe&ual than any others. For,\nfince it is admitted that an union of beams affords the greateft influence,,\nfo it is allowed that the conjunction and oppofition are, for this reafon,\nthe moft potent and powerful configurations of all others, as is ihewn\nby the following figure, where we find the beams, as well incident as re-\nfie&ed, to be united.\nFor, let A be fuppofed in conjun&ion with B, it is firft manifeft that\nall the beams flowing from G and E, the points of touch in the circum*\nference of A , fhall unite themfelves with the betas that are fent from\nB to C, the earth\u2019s centre. Secondly, we are alfo to obferve, that in\nthis cafe the beams A C , or B C, coming from the centre of the ftars,\nrefledt only into itfelf, as being perpendicular ; whereas thole beams\nwhich are fent from the points E and G make an acute angle at C, and\nreflect the one into the other at equal angles j as G C reflect from C to\nE, and E C from C to G . Laftly, the union that happens in an oppofi\u00ad\ntion is manifeft without any illuftration, where the beams fent from the\noppofite points mako-but one ftrait line, as G F, and E H, in the\nforegoing figure.\nIn\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 417\nIn like manner* in my contemplation* the configurations of the fex-\ntile and trine have a concurrence of their beams at the earth, and a mu\u00ab\ntual reflection of the one into the other* and fo an union by refie&ion* as\nin the following figure is manifeA.\nFor* admit A B C to be three Aars, A and B in a Textile configuration,\nand A C in a trine ; then, for fo much as B F, the beam incident of the\nfextile, falls obliquely in refpect of A F, and makes an acute angle there\u00ad\nwith, it is evident, to any one who has the fmallefi underAanding in\noptics, that B F fhall reflect to C, and fo be united to C F, the inci\u00ad\ndent of the Aar C, which is in a trine configuration with A. For the\nfame reafon, C F fhall reflect to the Aar in B, and be alfo united with B\nF , the incident of the Aar at B. And hence arife the grounds of that\nfamiliarity in thefe archs of heaven, which Ptolomy has laid down as the\nmoA apt for the apheta of life* or the houfes of the figure'. .\nBut the quartile afpect, whofe beams only cut each other ad angulos\nreifos, and fo reflect into tbemfelves, derives its principal virtue from\nthe exact proportion of its angles in taking up the centre of the earth ;\nand hence the tnyAery of thefe configurations wholly confifis in this, that\nthefe irradiations only, and thofe that are derived from them, are pro\u00ad\nportionable unto all patible matter, and therefore moA effectual. For\nthat thefe irradiations only are every way proportionable, has been al\u00ad\nready abundantly proved, whether we refpect their taking up thecircum-\nference, the power, and proportion, of their fubtenfes, untdfh'e diameter,\nor, laAly and principally, their occupying of place at the centre of the\nearth by their angles* whereby they muA needs fhinc upon all element iry\n\f41\u00ab A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nmatter with a due and even mixture of light and influence. And, fince\nno other archs, fubtenfes, or angles, are found to enjoy thefe preroga\u00ad\ntives, it is evident that thefe, above all others, have that fymmetry of\nproportion which is neither defective, interrupted, nor redundant; but*\nl'uch are the archs, fubtenfes, and angles, of thefe irradiations, that thefe,\nand no other, are exactly proportionable. Now as that which is defedtive,\nand wants equality of proportion, leaves the action fruftrate and with\u00ad\nout effect; fo that, which on the other faaod offends in excefs, muft needs\nincur the contrary fault, and overcharge that which either nature or art\nintended to perform ; whereby it will neceifarily follow, that, wherever\nthere is no defect, nor excefs, but an equal and juft mixture of the in\u00ad\nfluence of the ftars in thefe irradiations, thefe only can be apt and pro\u00ad\nper to produce perfect and agreeable effects in the formation and tempe\u00ad\nrature of all fublunary things. For it happens in thefe effects which are\nproduced by the mixture of light and heat, juft the fame as in chemi\u00ad\ncal operations, where a defect of heat produces nothing ; while, on the\ncontrary, excefs will deftroy the whole, either by fublimation, vitrifica\u00ad\ntion, eruption, or the like.\nHaving thus fatisfactorily {hewn how the points of the ordinate planes,\nwhereunto thefe configurations have been compared, often reiterated, do\ntake up place, 1 fhall now fet forth how the beams of any two ftar6 in\nany one of the former configurations fhall occupy more fpace than that\nwhich is comprehended between their incidents or beams of true motion;\nand how by their beams, either incident, reflected, or oppofite, they\noccupy and pofiefs the whole centre of the earth at one inftant with pro\u00ad\nportionable angles. To demonftrate this, in refpect to the conjunction\nand oppofition, whofe force rather depends upon union than proportion,\nI need only refer the reader to a view of the laft diagram but one, where\nhe will find that the united beams of fuch ftars as are in conjunction and\noppofition furround the centre, and all elementary matter wbatfoever,\nfubject to the actions of heaven. With regard to the quartile, whofe\nbeams incident and oppofite traverfe the centre of the earth at four right\nangles, viz. at A F G , G F I, A F H, and H F I ; and feeing four\npoints of a rectangle quadrilater figure hath been already proved to occu\u00ad\npy place; I likewile need no otherproof, in this configuration, than that the\nreader will in the laft figure obferve how thefe four right angles, made\nby one quartile afpect, take up the centre of the earth. ' But, concerning\nthe trine and Textile afpects, we have yet more to confider; for, fuppofe\ntwo ftars, A and B, in the laft diagram, irradiate The earth with theic\nfextile beams ; although it be true, that, by protracting the oppofite\nbeam from B to F, the centre of the earth feems occupied with propor-\n2 tionable\n\fO P A S T R O L O G Y . 4\n*9\nti&nabte angles, B F A being fubtelftded by the ark of fixty 'degree*,\nwhich is before declared to be the angle of an ordinate equilateral trian\u00ad\ngle, and fo leaves the outward angle B F I equal to the angle of an ordi-\n\u00abRate hexagon, fubtended here by the ark of one hundred and twenty de\u00ad\ngrees, which is the ark of a trine j and the like being alfo found in the\nangles made by the oppolite beams ad vertiam j yet, neverthelefs, we\nmuft here confider how the incident beam of B, viz. B F, reflects into\nC, and fo takes up the whole femicircle A B C I with three Textiles, viz.\nA F B, B F C, and C F I. In like manner, if we fuppofe C to be in\na triangular configuration with A, it is evident that as the oppofite beatn\nof A, viz. F I, makes a Textile with the incident beam of a ftar at C, viz.\nC F ; fo C F, being the beam incident of the ftar at C, reflects alfo to\nthe point B, and fo makes the fame three Textile afpeds wherewith the\naforefaid whole femicircle is occupied, as above demonftrated. Thefe\ncohfiderations will undoubtedly fatisfy the reader how any two ftars, in\neither of the afpeds above alluded to, proportionably occupy the whole\ncentre of the earth in the fame moment of time, without reiterating the\nfame angle.\nI have hitherto only fpoken of what are termed the old configurations,\nwhich are indifputably the moil excellent; but I lhall now mention\nwhat are called the new ones, as introduced by the ingenious Kepler,\nnamely, the quintile confifting of feventy-two degrees ; the biquintile,\nof one hundred and forty-four degrees ; and thcjefquiquadrate, of one\nhundred and thirty-five degrees j which afpeds, being added to the for\u00ad\nmer, make eight configurations, anfwering to the eight confonant flops\nin a monochord. Thefe new additions are by no means improperly made,\nfincemany eminent praditioners of this fcience have experienced their uti\u00ad\nlity in fpeculations on the weather and meteors; as well as in bringing\nup the accidents of a nativity. Neither is there any want of philofophi-\ncal or mathematical demonftrations to fupport them; for as in mufic\nthere are but three perfed concords, namely, the diapafon, diapente,\nand diateftaron ; fo in aftrology there are but three perfed afpeds anfwera-\nble to them, viz. the oppofition, the trine, and the quartile j the Textile\nhaving already been proved an imperfed afpect, anfwering exactly to B\nfiat, the firft among the imperfect and compounded concords. Where\u00ad\nfore, confidering that the firft three perfect concords are found to have\ntheir perfect afpects anfwerable unto them, and that B fiat, being an im-\nJ\njerfect concord, is alfo found to agree exactly in proportion with the\nextile, being an imperfect afpect, this undoubtedly gave Kepler fuffici-\nent reafon to conceive that the other harmonical proportions contained in\nthe fame monochord might alfo have their afpects, namely, the quin\u00ad\nN o. fii. 5 1 tile,\n\f420 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\ntile, biquintile, and fefquiquadrate, which are precifeJy found to cor-\nrefpond with them, and are in a fimilar degree effectual in their mode of\noperation.\nThus having explained what the afpects or configurations of the pla\u00ad\nnets really are, and proved that their power and influences are grounded\nupon philofophical and mathematical principles, I (hall now proceed to\n{hew their applications in the iffues of human life, from the conception\nto the grave.\nl\\ is, l believe, univerfally admitted, that the beginning of human\ngeneration takes place at the time of conception ; and therefore we ought\nto be exact in afcertaining this time, and in confidering the effective\npower of the configurations of the itars, as they then happen to be pofited,\nand from thence contemplate the qualities of the mind and body. For\nin the beginning, although the feed at once affumes a quality by the\ncommunication of the circumambient matter, which at other times of\nits formation and inercafe becomes different ; yet naturally, as it in-\ncreafes, it retains its own proper matter, and is rendered more like the\npeculiar nature of the firft quality, with which it was imp relied at the\ntime of conception. But, if it be of fome importance to know the time\nof conception, it is infinitely more fo to know the true time of birth ;\nfor by the firft, the accidents only before birth are known ; but by the\nfecond, thofe incident to our whole lives are to be difeovered. Where\u00ad\nfore one may be called a beginning, and the other an after-beginning;\nthe fixft* the generation of human feed ; the fecond, that of man. For\nin this ftate the infant aifumes many things which it had not when in the\nwomb, and thele peculiar to human nature alone, and the formation of\nthe body. And although the properties of the celeftial and elemen\u00ad\ntary matter feems to confer nothing at the time of birth in rcfpect to the\nformation of the child, yet it operates moil forcibly upon it in other re-\nfpecti ; for nature, after perfecting the formation, difpofes the enluing\neffect according to the ftate of the former at the beginning. Hence it\nis reasonable, in thofe whofe time of conception is unknown, that the\nconfigurations of the ftafs formed at their birth, ihould be fignificative ;\nnot that it wholly contains an effective power, but becaufe it neceifarily\nhath a power by nature fimilar to the effective. But it is always beft, if\nthe time of conception can be had, to compare it with the time of birth ;\nfor the time of conception (hews what (hall happen to the infant while in\nthe womb; as whetherit (hall be ilrong or weak, firm or infirm, perfect or\nimperfect, male or female, finglc or twins ; or whether it ihall arrive to\nthe full and perfect time of birth. But the occurrences of life after birth\nare to betonlidered from the pofition of the heavens at the birth only.\n2 Now\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 4ai\nNow, fince nothing can be predi&ed in aftrology without this funda\u00ad\nmental guide, namely, the radix, or true time of birth, various me\u00ad\nthods have been invented, indifferent ages, for thepurpofe of afcertain-\ning this point with precifion, after the eftimate or fuppofed time is\ngiven. And this is termed the replication of nativities, becaufe the\ntime ufually noted down by parents or midwives is feldotn corre\u00a3t, either\nthrough inattention, or errors in clocks; but, by thefe rules, the diffe\u00ad\nrence between the eftimate or fuppofed time, and the real, is difcovered\nand corredted. This re&ification is done by various ways; firft, by\ntheTrutineof Hermes; fecondly, by the Animoder of Ptolomy ; and,\nthirdly, by accidents of the native\u2019s life, which are alfo fivefold ; firft,\naccording to Argol ; fecondly, according to Kepler; thirdly, according\nto Morinus; fourthly, by the luminaries; and fifthly, by a new and\nmore corretl method. \u2022\nBy the Trutineof Hermes, ereft the figure to the eftimate time of\nbiith, and reftify the Moon\u2019s place thereto; then take her diftance from\nthe afcendant, if fhe be under the earth ; or from the feventh houfe, if\nabove the earth, by fubtrabling the angles from the Moon\u2019s place;\nadding thereto the three hundred and fixty degrees of the zodiac, if fub-\ntrattion cannot be made without: then with the remainder enter the fol\u00ad\nlowing table under the column of Moon\u2019s diftance, and even with it, in the\nfecond column, if the birth was in February ; in the third column, if in\nJanuary or December ; in the fourth column, if in April or September;\nor in the fifth column, if in March, May, June, July, Auguft, October,\nor November; will be found an equation of days to be added to, or fub-\ntraffed from, the day of birth, according to the letters A or S, at the\ntop of each refpeftivc column, whofelum or difference gives the day of\nthe month in the month of conception ; always obferving, that, if the\nyear of birth be a leap-year, one day more muft be added\u00ab\nThe\n\f4 \u00ab A N I L L If S T R A T I 0 N\nT he T A f i L\nE '\n1\n( ,\n* dift A 1 A A S | i dift, A A A ' A. j\n1\n0 o 3 : \u00a3 2 0 '6 O 0 I\n1\n2 3\no 13 2 t s 1 5 *7 I 2 n\n3 4\n\u2022 0 26\u2019 1 s I 2 \u2022\njC 5 4 2 3 4\n5\n\u2019w\nU\n!\n,u ! 9 s 1 2 3\nu\nW 4 21 3\n1\n4 5 6\n1 21 1 2 3 4 A\n\u00bb\nA.\n4 9 4 5 6 7\nX\n4 2 4 2 3 4 5 3 26 5 6 7 8\n2 *7 3 4 5 6 \u00a3 3 *3 6 7 8 9\n\u00a3\n1\n6\ni *\n8\n3 0 4 s 7 1 C 3 0 7 9 1 0\no\no 3 13 5 6 7 & O 2 \u00bb7 8 9 10 1 1\ns 3 26 6 7 8 9 % 2 4 9 1\n10 11 12 i\n\u00a3\n4 9 7 8 9 10 A\ni\n\u00a3\nI 21 IO\n- - - -\nII 12 13\ni\n4 21 8 9\n1\n10 11 1 9 11 12 \u00bb3 H\n5 4 9 10 11 12 0 26 12 13 14 15\nS 17 10 11 12 13 0 *3 *3 14 15 l6\n6 O 1 r 12 13 14 lo 0 14 15 l6 17 1\nIf the birth was in January, the month of conception was A p ril; if\nFebruary, the month of conception was M ay; if March, June ; if\nApril, July j if May, Auguft; if June, September ; if July, O&ober j\nif Auguft, November ; if September, December; if O&ober, January ;\nif November,\u00abFebruary ; and, if December, March. Then bring the\nMoon\u2019s place, the day of conception, to the fign, degree, and minute,\nafcending, at the eftimate time, for the true time of conception. O r\nth u s: fubtradt the right afceniion o f the Sun at the eftimate time o f con\u00ad\nception, from the right afceniion at the eftimate time of birth, (taken in\nthe Table of Houfes right againft the Moon\u2019s place, under the afcendant,\nadding the three hundred and fixty degrees or the zodiac, as before, if\nfubtraftion cannot otherwife be made;) the remainder, converted into\ntime, is the true hour and minute o f conception. The degree and mi\u00ad\nnute of the iign in which the Moon was podted at conception is the\ntrue degree and minute afcending at birth, according to the Trutine of\nHermes.\nTo\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 423\nTo rcftify by the Animoder of Ptolomy, ereft the figure as near a*\npoflible to the eftimate time of birth9 and confider in what fign, and in\nwhat degree of that fign9 the new Moon happened that laft preceded the\nbirth ; or, if a full Moon more nearly preceded the time of birth than a\nnew, then nofe the degree of the fign wherein either of the luminaries\nwere pofited that were above the earth; but, if one of the luminaries be\nexa&Iy rifing, and the other fetting, prefer that which is rifing. Then\nobferve which of the planets hath moil dignities by triplicity, houfe, ex\u00ad\naltation, term, or configuration, in the degree of fuch preceding new\nMoon, or in the degree of the luminary above the earth, or that afcends\nat fuch preceding full M oon; and alfo what fign and degree then afcerid\nupon the horizon, or that culminate or poflcfs the cufp of the tenth\nhoufe; and if the degree of the planet, dignified as above, be lituated\nnearer the degree afcending than to the degree culminating, place the\nfame degree in number of the fign afcfcnding upon the cufp of the\nafcendant that fuch ruling planet poffefTed of the fign he was in. But,\non the contrary, if the planet be nearer the degree on the cufp of the\ntenth houfe or medium cceli than to the afcendant, then the degree\nculminating, or poffeffing the cufp of the midheaven, muft be made\nthe fame with the degree the faid planet was in ; and fo, according to\nthe fign and degree thus ascertained, muft the other houfes of the\nfigure be varied ; a*nd this will be the true time of the native\u2019s birth.\nBut, if it fhould happen that ttfo planets have equal digpitie^in-the\ndegrees aforefaid, prefer that which is pofited the neareftjtc\/the afcen\u00ad\ndant. Ptolomy further obferves, that what fign the Moon is in at the\ntime of birth is the very fign which afeended at the conception ; and\nagain, whatever fign the Moon \u00a19 in at conception, that, or the oppofite,\nwill be the fign afcending at birth.\n\u2022\nTo re&ify by accidents, according to the method of Argol, fet the\nfcheme exadly to the eftimate time, and draw it into a fjftculum; then\nrun down the columns in the fpeculum belonging to the afcendant and\nmedium cceli, conlidering what dire&ions might moil probably fignify\nthe accidents given, obferving the afcendant for accidents befalling the\nbody } the medium cceli for things relating to credit or reputation, as\ntrade, honour, diflionour, preferment, &c. and convert the time of the\naccident into an arch of direction, by Naibod\u2019s meafure of time; and then,\nfinding the true, right, or oblique, afeenfion of the promiflor with lati\u00ad\ntude, if he hath any, from which fubtrading the arch of direction, the\nremainder will be the right afeenfion of the medium cceli, or oblique\nafeenfion of the afcendant. If it be the oblique afeenfion of the afeen\ndant, fubtract ninety degrees from it, the remainder will be the righ\nNo. 21. 5 K afeeniio'\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n424\nafcenfion of the medium cceli corrected, between which and the right\nafcenfion of the medium cceli of the fuppofed time take the difference ^\nwhich add or fubtract to or from the fuppofed time, according as the right\nafcenfion of the medium cceli did increafe or decreafe, and the fum or\ndifference is the true time of birth required.\nSecondly, according to Kepler, gather a table of the Sun\u2019s place for\neighty, ninety, or one hundred, days, more or lefs, immediately lucceed-\nitig the day of birth ; then, having the time of the accident, number fo\nmany days of the Sun\u2019s motion as there were years elapfed from the\nbfrth, making proportion for the odd days, and find the Sun\u2019s place at\nthat time, with the right afcenfion thereof, which fubtract from the\noblique afcenfion of the promiifor denoting the accident, added to two\nhundred and feventy degrees, the remainder is the right afcenfion of time\ncorrected; where note, that, having fet the figure to the eftimate time,\ncalculate the Sun\u2019s place thereto, and find the difference between that\nand his place at noon the day of birth; which, if it exceeds his place of\nbirth, fubtract the aforefaid difference from his place at noon, agreeing\nwith that day fignifying the number of years in which the accident\nhappened ; but, if it be lefs, add ; fo ihall the difference or fum be the\nSun\u2019s direction for years complete ; then, for the odd days of the acci\u00ad\ndent, if any be, find the Sun\u2019s diurnal motion, in the find collection,\nagainft. the \u00bflay fignifying the faid number of years, and fay, as three\nhundred arfa \u00a7xty-five days fix hours are to the Sun\u2019s diurnal motion,\nfo are the laid odd days to the odd minutes, which are to be added to the\nSun\u2019s direction aforefaid, which fum is the Sun\u2019s true place at the time\nof birth. But, to rectify it by an accident compared with the medium\ncceli, fubtract the right afcenfion of the Sun, found by the former rule\nfor the year and day of |he accident, from the right afcenfion of the pro\u00ad\nmiflor, (by adding three hundred and fixty degrees, if fubtraction cannot\nbe made without,) and the remainder is the right afcenfion of time cor\u00ad\nrected.\nThirdly, according to Morinus, to rectify the afeendant or medium\ncceli by a direction to the conjunction or oppofition of the promifTor of\nany accident is exactly the^faine with A rgo l; but, if it be to the Textile,\nquartile, or trine, of any fuch promiifor, firft find their latitude, and\nthen in all refpects follow the fame method as is above given in the di\u00ad\nrections of Argol.\nT o rectify by the luminaries, proceed as follows : I f no direction of\neither angles will anfwer to the accident given, and it be eminent,\nconlider\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 425\nconfider the pofition of the luminaries, and fee what diredlion of either\nof them might moil probably fignify the fame; which done, find the\nluminaries pole of pofition exacily for its place in the efiimate figure,\nunder which pole diredt the faid luminary to the faid probable promiiTor,\nand find the difference between that and the time of the accident convert\u00ad\ned into an arch of diredlion ; then make a fecond fuppofition, at the\npole of polition, working as before; and, noting the difference betweea\nthe arches of the two dircdlions, f-y, as the difference of thele two arches\nis to the difference in the poles of pofition, lb is the firft aforefaid dif\u00ad\nference to the difference between the firil fuppofed pole of pofition\nand the true pole of the luminary propofed ; but it is neccflury fiere,\nthat tlie eftimate time he given pretty exad. Thus, having found the\ntrue pole or polition, it gives the tiue oblique afeention or delccnfion o f\nthe luminaries, with its difLnce from the meridian ; by which may be\nfound the medium cceli correct, and thereby the true time of birth.\nBefides thefe, there are f vcral new methods o f redifying nativities\nby accidents. For inftjnce, let the figure to the efiimate time, and\ndraw a fpeculum thereto; in which, helides the alpeds of the planets,\ninfert alfo the afpeds which the afeendant and medium caeli make with\nevery fign ; this done, confider wh.it promiffors occur to a conjunction,\nTextile, quartile, trine, or oppofition, of the afeendant or medium cccli,\nand for every year account one day in the Ephcmcris to the year current\nin which the accident happened, find that promiffor\u2019s place (in that\nday adhering to the year current) for the eftimate time of birth ;\nfaying, rs twenty-four hours is to the planet\u2019s diurnal motion, fo are\nthe hours and minutes elapfed from noon to the minutes to be added or\nfubtraned to or from the planet\u2019s place at noon that day according as\nthe faid planet was either direti or retrograde; then, lailly, as three hun\u00ad\ndred and fixty five days fix hours are to that promilfor\u2019s diurnal motion,\nfo is the number of days elapfed from the birth (at the termination of\nwhich the accident fell out) to the minutes to be again added or fub-\ntradted to or from the aforefaid place of the faid promiiTor, as he was\ndirtdi or retrograde; to which very degree and minute the afeendant or\nmedium cceli muff be brought. But, if there be no diredlion of the\nafeendant or medium cceli to fignify that accident, confider what other\nfignificator, being diretted to any likely promiiTor, might effedt the\nlame; and, in the Ephemeris, againil that day fignifying the number of\nthe years current, for the eftimate time of birth find the place of the laid\npromiiTor; then lay, as three hundred and fixty-five dajs fix hours arc\nto twenty-four hours, fo are the days elapfed (in which the accident\nhappened from the birth-day) to their proportioned part: fecondly, as\n\u2022 twenty-four\n\f426 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\ntwenty-four hours are to th$ fignificator's diurnal motion, fo is the afore-\n\u00a3nd proportional part to the minutes and feconds, which are to be fub-\ndufled out of the place of the aforefaid promiflor ; and the remainder is\nthe exa^i place of the iaid fignificator at the true time of birth. In this\ncafe it will be nrqeflary to have the eftimate time very near, and that\nthe Sun, Venus, Mercury, or the Moon, be fignificators; and Saturn,\nJupiter, or Mars, or their afpefts, protniflbrs; otherwife, if the more\nweighty planets be fignificators, take the diurnal motion of the promiflor\nand work as before; fubducling thefe minutes and fcconds from the\nfigbificator, and the remainder is the exa& place of the promiflor at the\ntrue'time of birth. If yet nodireiftion appears, which may fignify the\ngiven accident, confiderthe Moon\u2019s diredions on the right-hand page of\nthe Ephemeris, againft the day fignifying the year current in which the\naccident happened ; and, allowing two hours for a month, fubtrad the\ndavs elapled from the birth-day from the hours and minutes, adhering\nto the lunar afpect, and the remainder will be the hour and minute of\nbirth corrected. The fame obfervation likewife holds good with refpect\nto the mutual afpects.\nBut the ihorteft, eafieft, and moft Ample, way of rectifying a nativity,\nand which includes all the perfections of the foregoing, provided the\neftimate time does r\/t exceed two hours of the real, is as follows.\nHavingere&ed the Satire to the eftimate time, obferve whether either of the\nluminaries be pofiyid in the centre of any one of the three prime angles,\nnamely, the afee'idant, medium ceeli, or feventh houfc, or near them;\nand, if fo, bring either of them to the cufp of the angle, and the\ndegree and iW.nute they were in is the true time of birth. But, if\nneither of th'\/e are found thus centrically pofited, nor near the cufps of\neither of tliofe angles, then bring them to a right parallel from angles,\nand that will be the true time. If their poiitions will not admit of\nthis, obferve the two benefic planets Jupiter and Venus, and note\nwhether either of them arc fituated as above fpecificd, namely, in the\ncentre of the angles, or in a right parallel with either of the luminaries,\nthat is to fay, with the Sun by day, or the Moon by night; and cither\nof thefe brought to the cufps as before, will give the true time of\nbirth. So likewife either ef the malefic planets Saturn and Mars, if\nfound pofited in the centre of the angles, or near their cufps, or in\nparallel to either of the luminaries as above, will be the prorogator of\nlife, and likewife ihew the true time of birth; but thefe laft pofitions\narc rarely if ever found in the fchemes of grown perfon\u2019s nativities,\nbecaufe their influences, if not corrected by the rays of benevolent\n3 iters,\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 427\nBars, are of fo deflru&ive a tendency, that they generally cut off life\nin a lhort time, either in infancy, or at -lead in the firit ilage of life.\nNow, having brought a nativity from its eltimative or fuppofed time\nto that of the real, we are next to confider its proper and contingent\nparts and lignifications, fo far as they relate to accidents before birth, and\nto thofe after the fubjedt comes into the world; as alfo to parents,\nbrethren, and relations, of the native. The particular confiderations\nbefore birth relate to fex, as whether the infant be male or f e m a l e '\nand likewife to number, as whether there be twins or not. The caufes\u201d\nof deformity, of monfters, and of thofe which periih in the womb for\nwant of nourishment, are alfo included in this part of the dodtrine of\nnativities. But the particular fubje&s of enquiry after birth relate to\nthe length of life and form of the bodyj to bodily difeafes, and\naccidental hurts and blemishes of the members ; to the faculties of the\nmind and mental affe&ions. They likewife include the future fortune\nof the native, as well in poiTeilions as in dignities; and alfo in the\nquality of his adtions. Then concerning marriage and procreation ; the\nharmony of friends, and animoiity of enemies; next of travellingj\nand, laftly, of death.\u2014 But the consideration concerning death is natu\u00ad\nrally joined to that which relates to the fpace of life. Since it Shews the\nquality and mode of its termination.\nIt may naturally be aiked, how thefe events are feverally and refpec-\ntively distinguished ? To explain this, let it be always remembered, that,\nfor any particular event, we are to refer to fuch peculiar place in the\nzodiac as is proper to that fpecies of action in the geniture concern\u00ad\ning which we are about to enquire. And, whatever liar is found to\nhave dominion in fuch place, either by triplicity, houfe, exaltation,\nterm, or configuration, fuch Bar Shall have dominion of the event. . But,\nif two or more liars Shall be found in thefe feveral portions, then that\nBar which has familiarity by moll ways, namely, that has the majority\nof dignities, Shall be taken as ruler of the event, and Shall alfume the\ndominion accordingly. The quality of the event is always known from\nthe nature of thefe ruling liars, added to that of the figns in which thofe.\nStars are pofited, and the familiarities they have with the other Signifi\u00ad\ncant parts of the heavens. The extent and importance of the event is\nknown from the lordlhips and dominions of thefe ruling liars, according\nto their Strength or weaknefs in refpect of their afpects in the world and\nthe geniture. They are Strong in refpect of the world, when they are\nin propef places, or oriental, or augmented j and in refpect of the ge\u00ad\nniture, when they make their tranfits on the angles, or fuccedent houfes j\nNo. 21. 5 L but\n\f428 A N I L L U S T * R A T I O N\nbut particularly when they occupy the cufps of the afeendant or mid\u00ad\nheaven. And they are deemed weak in refpect of the world, when they\nare in occidental places, and flow, retrograde, and diminiihing their\ncourfcs ; but weak in refpect of the geniture, when they are in cadent\nhoufes, or falling from the angles. The general time of the event is\nknown from thefe ruling ftars being orientally or occidcntally pofited in\nrefpect of the Sun and the horofeope, and from their being in the angles\nor fuccedent houfes $ for, when they are matutine or angular, they are\nquick $ but, when occidental or vefpertine, flow.\n\u2022Thefe things being premifed, it follows that the firft confideration upon\nthe face of a geniture is that which relates to the parents of the native.\nThe Sun, therefore, and Saturn, reprefent the perfon of the father; and\nthe Moon and Venus that of the motherj and, as thefe are found\nafflicted among themlelves, or otherwife, fo we underftand the accidents\nappertaining to parents will be. The ftars that are configurated with\nthe luminaries ihew what relates to their fortunes and poffeflions $ for, if\nthey are furrounded by the benefics, and by fuch as are of the fame\nnature, and in the fame figns, or the fucceeding, their fortunes will be\nilluftrious and fplendid ; particularly if the Sun be configurated with\noriental ftars, or the Moon by occidental. If Saturn and Venus be ori\u00ad\nentally pofited, or angular, they foreihew happinefs according to the par\u00ad\nticular circumftances of each parent. If the luminaries are void o f courfe,\nand in no good afpect with the fortunate ftars, a low condition, or an\nignoble life, is prenoted : but, if the luminaries arc varioufly configu\u00ad\nrated with good and evil ftars, a mediocrity and inequality in the fortunes\nof the parents is thereby demonftrated; as when Mars afeends to the\nSun, or Saturn to the Moon, and the benefics in different conditions.\nAgain, if the part of fortune in the nativity is found in a good pofition,\nwith the ftars configurated with the Sun and Moon, the affairs of the\nparents will be profperous; but, if it be difeordant, and fituaied in a bad\nplace of the figure, with malefic ftars, their concerns will turn out inju\u00ad\nrious and unprofitable.\nThe length and (hortnefs of life muft be confidered from other confi\u00ad\ngurations. If Jupiter or Venus arc any way joined in afpcct with the Sun\nor Saturn, or if Saturn hath an harmonizing configuration with the Sun,\nthat is, if they behold each other by a Textile or trine, and ftrongly dig\u00ad\nnified in other refpects, they promife lonjj_ life to the father. But if\nthefe pofitions are found weak, wirg Mars dignified above the Sun, and\nSaturn in quartile or oppolition, the father will be taken off in the early\npart of his life. The diftinctione which relate to the mother are thefe.\n2 If\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 429\nI f Jupiter is configurated to the Moon or Venus, or Venus alone tjeholds\nthe Moon by a fextile or trine afpeft, the mother.will fifljoy-health and\nlong&uty; but, if Mars be pofited in any of the angular or fucceedent\nhoufes, beholding the Moon or Venus with a quartile or oppofition; or\nif Saturn is thus configurated with the Moon, flow in motion, and de\u00ad\nclining from angles ; they induce the diredt contrary effedts, and pro\u00ad\nclaim a difeafed and Ihort life to the mother. Thus from the nativity of\na child may the principal concerns of the father and mother be fought\nout, and alcertained $ and fuch is the fympathy exifting by this bond o f\nnature and confanguinity, that little difference will be found, if com*\npared with the proper nativity of each parent. ,\nBut, to give judgment in fuch cafes with correftnefs, feparate fchemes\ninuft be erected for the father and mother, by the following rule. In\nthe figure erefled for the father, if the nativity be diurnal, note the :\ndegree in which the Sun is pofited in the child\u2019s nativity, and make that\nthe degree afcending upon the horofcope for the father; and conforma\u00ad\nble to that order the cufps of all the other houfes, by the rules hereto\u00ad\nfore laid down. I f the figure be eredted for the mother, then take the\ndegree of Venus, inltead of the Sun, and proceed in all other refpedts\nthe fame. But, if the nativity be noftumal, take the degree of Saturn for\nthe father, and that of the Moon for the mother. And in all thefe cafes\nit muft be obferved, that the nativity of the firft-born is to be pre\u00ad\nferred, then that of the fecond, and fo on. And that whatever is pre\u00ad\nnoted in relation to the parents from thefe figures, is only fuch as (hall\nhappen to them after the birth of the child, and not to any thing before.\nThe time in which any or each of thefe events will happen, is to be\nfought out by the archs of direction, or diftances of that liar which hath\nthe dominion in refpedt of the Sun and the angles of the world $ and\nthis I ihall make perfedtly eafy to the meaneft underftanding, when I\ncome to treat of directions in general.\nNow the next confideration in the native\u2019s geniture is the place o f\nbrethren, and this is taken from the fign on the mid-heaven, and the\nmaternal place, which is the pofition of Venus by day, and the Moon by\nn igh t; for, as this can only relate to children born of the fame mother,\nthis fign, and that which fucceeds it, being maternal, naturally confti-\ntutes the place of brethren. This place, therefore, being configurated by\nbenevolent liars\u2019, denotes plenty of brethren, becaufetheincreafe of bro\u00ad\nthers and filters happens according to the multitude of liars, and from\ntheir being lituated in double-bodied figns, or in thofe of one form.\u2014\nBut, if the malefics have fuperiority in number or power, or are adveife\nby\n\f43\u00b0\n\u25a0* #\nAN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nby oppofition, paucity of brethren will happen, particularly if unbe\u00ad\nnign ftars circumfcribe the Sun.' If the contrariety of afpects be in an\u00ad\ngular houfes, efpecially in the afcendant, Saturn will procure thofe that\nare firft. nouriihed, and firil born; and Mars will induce to fewnefs and\ndeath. Moreover, if the ftars which give brethren arc well-affected ac\u00ad\ncording to mundane lituations, the general fortunes of the brethren will\nbe glorious and famous; but mean and obfcure if the contrary portions\nhappen. If the malefics be fuperior in number and ftrength to the\nftars which give brethren, their conftitutions will be puny, and their\nlives (hort.\nAnd here alfo we may obferve, that from the geniture of one brother\nthe principal incidents of the life of another may be dil'covered, by con-\nftituting the place of the given planet as an horofcope, that is, the planet\nwhich has principal rule in the houfe of brethren, whether by day or\nnight. The method is to place this ruling planet, with the fame de\u00ad\ngree he is found in, upon the afcendant, furnilhing the cufps of all the\nother houfes by this ftandard, as before ftated in the cafe of parents. It\nmuft howevec always be remembered, that mafculine ftars produce\nmales, and feminine females. Alfo if the ftars which denote brethren, and\nthat which has rule in the houfe of brethren, agree by any harmonious\nconfiguration, they will be well-affected towards each other, and live in\nfriendihip and concord; but, if thefe ftars are found in contrary pofi-\ntions, and in figns inconjunct, enmity and hate will mark their conduct\ntowards each other.\nThe foregoing fpeculations are deduced from an inveftigation of the\npofition of the heavens at the time of birth; but, in order to know whe\u00ad\nther the infant be male or female, during the ftate of pregnancy, the\ntime of conception only muft be confidered. For this purpole, we muft\nparticularly obferve the pofition of both the luminaries in refpect to the\nhorofcope at the time of conception, together with the lituations of\nall the ftars which have a regard to them; and whether the ruling ftars\nare conftituted of a mafculine or feminine nature. For the production of\nmales and females is according to the diftinction of mafculine and fe\u00ad\nminine ftars, which I have already Ihewn proceeds from the nature of\nthe figns in which they are polited, and from their mutual and mundane\nrefpect; for, being oriental, they are mafculine; but, occidental, femi\u00ad\nnine. The fame likewife in refpect to the Sun; for, being oriental, they\nare referred to the male; and, occidental, to the female. Therefore thofe\nwhich have the greateft powerin thefe refpects at the time of conception\nwill give fufficient grounds to c\no\nn\nje\nc\ntu\nr\neat the fez of the infant for\nmonths before it is born.\nS\no\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 431\nSo liltewife the fame confederations hold good, io fome sefpeSs, con-\nOerniog twins, or more ; for herein we ere principally to regard the two\nluminaries, and the afcendant. For it happens through the mixtures\nwhich are occafioned when thefe poffefs bicorporal iigns, or when the\nruling planets are fituated in them, and many prolific ftars caft their rays\nto the fame, that it w ill be a plural conception. The number then\ngenerated is known from the ftar which induces the propriety o f the\nnumber; but the fex is determined by the ftars configurated with the\nSun, Moon, and horoscope. For we find from obfervation, that, when\nboth the luminaries are in the mid-heaveo, twins are procreated; when\nSaturn, Jupiter, and Mars, have configuration with the aifigned places\nin bicorporal figns, three males'are generated; but three females, when\nVenus, Luna, and Mercury, are configurated in the fame manner. Saturn,\nJupiter, and Venus, thus difpofed, produce two males and one female; but\nVenus, Luna, and Mars, two females and one male. Thefe configu\u00ad\nrations but rarely happening at the time of conception, render it a kind\no f phenomenon whenever they occur ; and hence we generally find the\nbirths that follow in confequence are ranked amongft the wonders of\nthe day in the public prints, though the caufe has a radical foundation\nin nature. And hence too it is, that, as thefe configurations are more or\nlefs imperfeftly made, fo will be the quality o f the conception, either\nbringing all into life uniform and perfe& at the birth, or elfe bringing\none with good conformation, and another with puny, imperfect, or tnon-\nftrous, members. '\nThere are alfo certain configurations of the ftars, which abfolutely pro\u00ad\nduce moles or monfters in every conception that takes place under\nthem. Thus it happens when the luminaries decline from angles, and\nfall cadent, without any kind o f afpeft to the afcendant, and when the\ncardinal houfes are occupied by the malefic planets. But, to deferibe\nthe fpecies of unnatural birth, it is neceftary, in thefe configurations, to\nobferve the place o f the laft full Moon preceding the time o f conception,\ntogether with the ruler thereof, and the lord of the luminaries; for, if\nthe placesof thefe fignificators have no familiarity with the place o f the\nfaid preceding full M oon, what is then generated will be of unnatural\nconformation. I f the luminaries are at the fame time pofited in four\u00ad\nfooted figns, and the two malefic planets in angular houfes, what Is\nthen conceived w ill not be in human lhape; but, if Jupiter or Venus in-\nterpofe their benevolent rays, and give teftimony to the luminaries, then\nwhat is conceived will be of human conformation, but of a fierce and\nfavage nature. I f Mercnry correfponds with the luminaries, the dif-\npofition w ill be agreeable to nature, but the form of the body will be\nN o. 22, 5 M unnatural;\n\f432 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nunnatural* or, if the luminaries be in human figns, and the ruling planet\ndifcordant, then the offspring will be of proper conform ation, but mon-\nftrous in quality. I f one of the malefic ftars give teftimony in any o f\nthe foregoing pofitions, what is then generated will be irrational, or o f\nungovernable qualities; but, if Jupiter Or Venus give teftimony, the\noffspring w ill naturally poflefs the mental accompliihments, with an her-\ninaphroditical conformation. If Mercury alone gives teftimony to the\naforefaid pofitions of the luminaries, that which is procreated will be\ndeaf, and perhaps dumb, though intellectually well qualified, and in-\ngenjous. Thefe fpeculations are doubtlcfs abftrufe, becaufe fuch con\u00ad\nfigurations feldom happen, and the refult of them is very little known ;\nbut, to confirm their effedt, I have only to recommend to thofe who\nhave their doubts, to be guided by obfervation, and to decide by the re-\nfu lt, for, the more we enquire into the pathlefs ways of nature, the more\nreadily we deduce a radical caufefor all her produdtions.\nBut here I muft not omit to remark, that the time of conception, and\nthat only, is to be referred to for the conformation or accidents of the\nchild in the womb ; and the time of birth for what (hall happen after;\nnotwithftanding there is always fuch a concurring agreement between\nthe conception and birth, that whatever is produced by the former is\nin a great meafure to be difeovered from the latter, though not wholly\ncorrect, or to be relied upon as infallible. Thofe therefore, who are\nborn in their natural ihape, and afterward become crippled and lame,\neven to a monftrofity, yet, fince not brought into the world with the na\u00ad\ntive, they fall under the defeription of blemifhes, or bodily infirmities,\nrather than the relult of monftrous and unnatural conformations.\nD iftind from this fpecies of conception, is that which, though per*\nfe&ly natural and well conformed, yet is void of ftamina, and hence\ntermed an embryo not nourifhed. This.kind of conception happens when\none of the luminaries, in an angular pofition, is joined with a malefic\nliar, and that luminary giver of life. So likewife, if the parallel of\nlongitude between the malefic planet and the luminary be partile, or\naccording to a figure of equal fades, and none of the fortunes correfpond-\ning, and at the fame time the lord of the luminaries be pofited in a dif\u00ad\ncordant place, what is then generated cannot be nouriihed, but decays\nin the womb, or expires foon after the birth. Or, if they are not equi\u00ad\nlaterally configurated, but the two malefic planets nearly irradiate the\nplaces of the luminaries, afflicting both, oroitty one of them\u00bb no matter\nwhether the malefics be fuccedent or oppofite, fo one or both of them be\nin partile configuration with the luminaries; for whatever is born under\n3 fuch\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 433\nfuch influences will be of no duration, fince the greatnefs- o f the power\no f the malefics will deftroy what ihould neccffarily conduce to the nou-\nriihment of life.\nIt is particularly to be obferved, that Mars affii&s the Sun by fuc-\nceflions, and Saturn the Moon ; but by oppofitions the contrary hap\u00ad\npens ; for in thefe the Sun is afflified by Sat urn, and the Moon by M ars;\nand this affliction is the more eminent when the malefic ftars are fignifi-\ncators, and by that means become fuperior both to the luminaries and\nthe horofcope, From thefe obfervations, fubordinate effects have been\nafeertained; for, when there are two oppofition$>,of the malefic ftars, and\nthe luminaries fituated in angles, whatever follows that conception w ill\nbe ftill-born. But if at this time the luminaries are feparating from the\nbenefic planets, or are in any other afpect with them, cafting their\nbeams at that time in a converfe direflion, the foetus will obtain anima\u00ad\ntion, and be found alive and perfect at the birth; but will live only fo\nmany months, days, or hours, as there are degrees, minutes, or feconds,\nof the folar motion, between the beams of the Aphcta and the neareft\nmalefic planet. But if the malefics caft their beams to the parts preced\u00ad\ning the luminaries, and the benefics to the degrees following, what is\nborn will fuffer great afflictions, and ftruggle much with infirmities, but\n(hall recover and live.\n\\\nAnd hence the confideration that naturally follows regards the dura\u00ad\ntion or fpacc of life, which, taking in the whole compafs of human pur-\nfuits, and the duration and viciffitudes of them, doubtlefs becomes the\nmoll intcreiling part of the doctrine o f the ftars. The mode of afeer-\ntaining this important point, namely, the fpace or duration of the na\u00ad\ntive\u2019s life, is defined from a comparifon of the aphetic, hylegiacal, or\nprorogatory, places, with the killing oranaretical places inthegenethliacal\nfigure, at the time of birth. The aphetic place is the fituation of the\nApheta, Hyleg, Prorogator, Significator, or giver of life, for they have\nall the fame meaning; and, the anaretic place is the fituation o f the\nAnareta, or killing planet; and, whenever thefe ihall meet together, or\nbe conjoined in a bodily afpect, the native will find a termination of life ;\nconfequently the length of time, in which the Apheta and Anareta,\nas pofited in each refpective figure of a nativity, will be in forming a\nconjunction, or coming together in the fame point of the heavens, is the\nprecife length of the native\u2019s life ; and this period is alcertained by what\nwe'teTtn atches o f diretiion, equated by the folar motion, and reduced\nto common time. The method of afeeriaining theft?' aphetical and\nanaretical places, of finding the arches o f direction, and of reducing\nthem\n\f45* A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nth\ne\nn\n! toth\ne c\no\nm\nm\no\nnm\ne\na\nfu\nr\ne o\nf tim\ne\n, \u00bf\nb\na\nll b\nec\no\np\nio\nu\nfly e\nx\np\nla\nin\ne\nd\na\nfte\nrw\neh\na\nv\neta\nu\ng\nh\ntth\nem\no\nd\neofa\nfc\ne\nr\nta\nin\nin\ngth\nep\na\nr\ntic\nu\nla\nro\nc\nc\nu\nr\nr\ne\nn\nc\ne\n\u00ab\n:\no\nfth\nen\na\ntiv\ne\n\u2019s life\n, fr\no\nmth\ne fa\nc\ne o\nf th\ne h\no\nr\no\nlc\no\np\ne\n, o\nr g\ne\nn\ne\nth\nlia\nc\na\nl\nfig\nu\nr\ne\n.\nOf th\neFO\nR\nMa\nn\ndTEM\nPER\nATU\nR\nEo\nfth\neB\nO\nD\nY\n*\nIfth\nc\nfp\na\nc\neo\nflifea\np\np\ne\na\nr\nslik\ne\nlytoe\nx\nc\ne\ne\ndc\nh\nild\nh\no\no\nd\n, w\nea\nr\ne n\ne\nx\ntto\nb\no\nn\nfid\ne\nt;a\nn\ndd\ne\nfin\neth\neih\na\np\nea\nn\ndfig\nu\nr\neof th\ne n\na\ntiv\ne\n\u2019sb\no\nd\ny\n, a\nc\nc\no\nr\nd\nin\ng\nto th\ner\nu\nle\ns h\ne\nr\ne\nto\nfo\nr\nela\nidd\no\nw\nn\n.

The quadrant from\nthe winter folftice to the fpring equinox gives a dark complexion, with\na moderate ftature, fquare and ftrong, abounding with cold and moif-\nture. This is to be underftood in reference to the figns afeending, aqd\nin which the Moon and other fignificators refpe&ively bear rule. But\nit is more particularly to be obferved, that the figns which are of hu\u00ad\nman form, both in the zodiac and without it, make bodies of a moil\nexcellent fymmetry and propottionj while thofe which are not of hu\u00ad\nman form ad contrariwife, deranging the proper rules of proportion,\nand influencing from the properties effential to an elegant fhape to that\nof difproportion and deformity.\nO f the radical Caufe of B L E M I S H E S and B O D I L Y\nD I S E A S E S .\nFrom a Similar hypothefis to the above, we derive the obfervation of\nexternal blemifhes and bodily difeafes, with all the common accidents\no f the human frame, to which the native is expofed during the courfe qf\nhis life. The moft approved mode of afeertaining and diftinguifhing\nthefe is by regarding the eaftern and weftern angles of the horizon, but\nparticularly the weftern, and the part preceding, which is the fixth\nhoufe, for that is inconjund with the oriental angle. Thefe angles\nbeing properly taken, we fhould next obferve the malefic ftars, and how\nthey are configurated ; for, if both or either of them are pofited upon the\nafeending parts of the faid angles, either bodily or by quartile or oppo-\nfition, there will be external blemifhes, or bodily infirmities, inse\u00ad\nparable from the perfon then born. Or, if both the luminaries, or only\none of them, be angular, as above deferibed, either in conjundion or\noppofition, with a malefic ftar afeending, they will produce fuch infir\u00ad\nmities or blemifhes as the particular places of the horizon and figns then\nafeending, and as\u2022the nature of the malefic and ill-affefted ftars, (hall\nrefpedively manifeftj for in this cafe, as in all (itnilar ones, the degrees\nof the figns which are upon the afHided part of the horizon will thew\nthe particular part of the body wherein the infirmity is, whether it be a\nblemifh or difeafe, or both; and the nature of thofe ftars w ill likewife\npoint out the caufe and quality of the fymptom,\nNo. 22. 5 N Blemifhes\n\f436 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n0 Blemifhes and bodily hurts for the mod part happen when the male*\nlies are oriental; but difeafes when occidental\u00ab And, as their caufe is\ndifferent, fo alio is their eflFcdt 5 for hurt or blemiih fuffers pain only\nonce* and is not prolonged; but a difeafe frequently com es^y fits, or\ncontinually affefts the patient, inducing a long and lingering diflolu-\ntion, or confumptive habit. Thefe are general confiderations; but the\nmore particular do&rine o f blemifhes and difeafes hath another fpecu-\nlation of figures, by which, for the moil part, fimilar accidents follow.\nFor blindnefs of one eye is indicated, when the Moon is poiited in cither\nat the aforementioned angles by herfelf, or at the precife time of be\u00ad\ncoming new or full; or when fhe is configurated in a quartile afpedt,\nand applies to any of the nebulous conventions in the zodiac. The fame\nmisioitune happens when Saturn or Mars, being oriental, afeend to the\nMoon, pofited in an angle; but, whenever they are thus configurated to\nboth the luminaries, either in the fame fign or in the oppofite, and\norientally pofited in refpedlof the Sun, but occidental in reipedt of the\nMoon, they caufe blindnefs in both the eyes. Mars ufually denotes\nblindnefs by the effedts of a blow or thruft, and by lightning, burning,\n& c. but, if configurated with Venus, it generally proceeds from an ac\u00ad\ncident in play or exercife, or from the fudden attack of aflaffins or def-\nperadoes.\nSaturn produces blindnefs by cataradls and colds, or by pin and web,\na$d by fuchlike accidents ; but, if Venus be pofited in any of the above-\nmentioned angles, particularly in the weft, configurated or joined with\nSaturn, and Mars at the fame time elevated, or in oppofition, the males\nthen born will be incapable of propagating their fpecies, and the females\neither wholly barren, or fubjeft to abortion, or to the bringing forth of\nitill-born children, or to fuch as adhere to the womb, and are obliged to\nbe feparated by manual operation, or brought away in pieces. This moil\ncommonly happens in the figns Cancer, Virgo, and Capricorn. But if\nthe Moon be at the fame time in the afeendant, configurated with Mer\u00ad\ncury or Saturn, and applying to Mats, what are then born will partici\u00ad\npate in the nature of both fexes, and perhaps be void of a natural paf-\nfage. It is likewife found, that, if the Sun be configurated with M er\u00ad\ncury, and both the luminaries difpofed after a mafeuline manner, the\nMoon decreafing, and the malefic ftars afeending in .the following de\u00ad\ngrees, the males will be deprived of the members proper for generation,\nor be irreparably blemiihed or inefficient in them, particularly in the\nfigns Aries, Leo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Aquaries; and the females will\nbe naturally barren all their lives.\n3 Impediments\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 43*\nIm\npedim\nents or blem\ni(hes in the fpeech are found to arife fi%\nift th\ne\nconfigurations of Saturnand M\nercury with the Sun, in the a&\nrefaid\nangles; particularly w\nhen M\nercury is pofited in the w\neft, an\nd beholds\nthe M\npon either by anoppofition orquartile afpeft. And, if ihefe con\u00ad\nfigurations happen to be m\nade in m\nute figns, a\ns in Cancer, Scorpio, or\nPifces, the im\npedim\nent will prove coniiderably greater. Again, if the\nm\nalefic ftars are pofited in angles, an\nd the lum\ninaries afeen\nd to them\neither by conjunction or oppofition ; or if the m\nalefics alcend to the\nlum\ninaries, an\nd the M\noon b\ne in her n\node in hurtful figns, a\ns A\nries\u00bb\nTaurus, Cancer, Scorpio, orCapricorn, the defedts of the body will be\nby lam\nenefs, gibbofitv, diftortion, or luxation. If the m\nalefic fta\nrs are\nin conjunction with the lum\ninaries, thefeafF\ned\ntio\nn\ns will take place from\nthe birth ; but, it they a\nre fituated inthe m\nid-heaven, elevated above the\nlum\ninaries, or in oppofition to them\n, they will arife fromthe concur\u00ad\nrence of various accidents, fuch a\ns falls, blows, w\nounds, an\nd the like,\nduring their progrefs through life.\nBlcm\nifhes happen for the m\noft part w\nhen the Moon is in tropical or\nequinofciial figns. In the vernal figns they a\nre chiefly occafioned by\nm\norphew; inthe futnm\ner, by tetters; in the autum\nn, by the fcurvy ;\nand, in the w\ninter, by biles an\ndother m\norbid eruptions. But difeafes\nm\noftly happenw\nhen the m\nalefic ftars a\nre configurated in the aforefiid\nangles, but contrarily a\ns to the lum\ninaries, viz. occidental to the Sun,\nan\nd oriental to theM\noon. In thefe pofitions Saturn induces to unufual\ncoldnefs in the belly an\nd reins, an\nd fubjedls the native to phlegm\natic\nhum\nours, bloody fluxes, jaundice, an\nd the whole train of hyfterical\naftedfions. M\nars occafions m\nelancholy, difeafes of the lungs, fiftulas,\nhot ulcers, an\nd putrefactions. If M\nercury co-operatcs with either of\nthefe ungracious planets, it is for theincreafe of evil, adding frefh vio\u00ad\nlenceto the diforder, an\ndperhaps fooner inducing afatal determ\nination.\nBut the properties of fom\ne bodily difeafes arifefromthe variety of\nfigns which p\no\nflfefstheforegoingconfigurations upon the two angles.\u2014\nFor inftance, Cancer, Capricorn, an\nd Pifces, cauie difeafes from pu\ntre-\nfadtion, tetters, fcurvy, or king\u2019sevil j but Sagittarius an\nd Gemini b)\nfalls, epilepfies, falling ficknefs, an\ndthe like.

It is likewife to be re\u00ad\nm\narked, that, if the pofition of the planet inducing the caufe be very\nftrong, the d\nefeift will be from the birthj but, if w\neak, it will arife\nfromfom\ne accidentafter birth.\nOf the natural BENT and QUALITY of the MIND.\nSuch is the doflrine of bodily accidents, a\ns deducible fromthe faceof\na genethliacal figurej but the qualities of the m\nind, a\ns ration\nal an\nd\nm\nental, arcjudged of fromthe conftitution of M\nercury with regard to\ndifferent figns an\nd planets. That which appertains to the fenfc alone,\nor that ren\nd\ners it irrational, is con\nfidered from the m\nore corporeal ftate\nof the lum\ninaries; that is, of the M\noon an\nd ftars configurated by fepa-\nration o\nr application. But, fince the anim\nal inclination is various, this\nfpeculationis contem\nplated fromm\nany an\nd divers obfervations, accord\u00ad\ning to the diverfity of figns which contain M\nercury an\nd the M\noon, or\nthe ruling ftars which have dom\ninion in them\n, an\nd that confertheir in\u00ad\nfluences to the tem\nper an\nd quality of the m\nindj together with the con\u00ad\nfigurations of thofe ftars which have refpe& to the Sun an\nd the angles\nconfidered a\ns to the proper an\nd diftinft n\nature with which each of\nthem ait upon the m\nental m\notions of each individual. It is there\u00ad\nfore generally found that tropical figns ren\nd\ner the native\u2019s m\nind highly\ningenious, full of invention, eagerin the purfuit of m\noral an\nd political\nknowledge, an\nd of great fortitude an\nd perfcverance. Double-bodied\nfigns agitate the m\nind withavariety of whim\nfical an\nd very uielcfs pur-\nfuits, lead the tongue toloquacious habits, an\nd induce tonegligence and\nfolly. Fixed figns fortify them\nind with prudence and-virtue, an\ndgive\nabias to ceconom\ny, chaftity, an\nd tem\nperance. Again, oriental confi\u00ad\ngurations produce m\nental qualitiesof aftrong an\ndingenious nature, free,\nopen, an\nd undiifem\nbled, quick of apprehenfion, conftani, juaicious,\nbenevolent, andchaftc; but the occidental on\nes a\nd\nt upon the m\nind\nin\n\f0 \u00ce A S T R O L O G Y .\nIn \u00e0tfery oppofite m\nanner, inclining the native to prbfligacy 'andintern,\npef\u00e2nce, an\ndim\npaitihg th\u00e9 ihtellctt byahaturally vicious difpofiliftn.\nIt is likewlfeajuft obforvation, that if the ftara which have dom\ninion\natepoiitedingoodplacesof thefigure, an\ndwell configurated\u00ab theyren\nd\ner\nthe m\nental endow\nm\nents exquifitely perfedt, an\ndinduce to ageneral good\nfortune. This is m\noll rem\narkably obvious in thofegenitures which\nhave M\nercury well configurated, and joined with the ieparationorip\n<\n-\nplication of the M\noon. But, if M\nercury an\nd theM\noon a\nrenot thus\ndifpofed, O\nrareaffiidled by the evil rays of the m\nalefics, they will even\nthen im\nprint the quality of their natures upon the foul, though not lo\nftrongly, but in alefs obvious an\nd m\nore obfcure degree j not tending\nfo m\nuch to good fortune an\ndadvancem\nent in thecom\nm\non concerns of\nlife. Hence the property of the ruling planet, w\nhether good or evil,\ninftils its ow\nn nature into the anim\nal lpirit, with a pow\ner an\nd energy\nequal to its predom\ninancy in the heavens at the hour of birth\u00ab an\nd this\nenergy is either ftrengthened or dim\niniihed, according to the force and\nadtion of fubordinate configurations j for thofe who, by reafon of ftrong\nm\nalefic rays, areprone toviolencean\ndinjuftice, havenottheirvicious in\u00ad\nclinations hindered, unlefs thefe evil rays areoppofed by fom\ne contrary\neffed\nt ; but, if acontrary afpedt oppofes this fam\niliarity of the m\nalefics,\nthe evil inclination is then proportionality corretted, and the m\nind is\nm\nore eafily brought to a proper fenfeof its intem\nperatepurfuits.

This variety of m\nental af\u00ad\nfections chiefly proceeds from the influences of Saturn, but they are\nm\noderated, an\nd differently difpofed, according to the nature an\nd force\nof thofe rays, which, a\ns w\ne have feen, are rcfpectively contributed by\nthe prefence of other planets. .\nJupiter having alone the dominion of the mind, and being well pofited\nin the figure, influences the animal foul to the moil noble and exalted\nideas of honour and rectitude, difpofing to magnanimity in the caufe of\nmorality and virtue, andleading the operative faculties to every praife-\nworthy act of generofity and benevolence, but, if Jupiter is pofitedin any\ndifeordant part of the figure, his influences have lefs effect; for, though\ni they\n\fo i A S T R O L O G Y .

H\nence it is obvious that the m\nore m\no\u00ad\nderatedifeafes of the m\nind have their radical caufe from a\nn excefs or\ndefedl of thofe operations which induce the m\nental qualities; for, the\npredom\ninancy of fuch qualities naturally prom\notes a\nn excefs of evil, an\nd\nconilitutes adifeafe, inproportiona\ns the am\nbient m\natter is unm\nixed, an\nd\naboveo\nr below a proper m\nediocrity; but the m\nore obvious an\nd fatal\ndifeafesof them\nind arife fromadifproportionor defeat of m\natter infinite\nlygreater, an\nd wholly befiden\nature.\nThofe who are born w\nhen M\nercury an\nd the M\noon are inconjundt,\neither in refpebt of them\nfeives or theoriental horizon, Saturn an\nd M\nars\nbeing angular, an\nd beholding the configuration, M\nars by night, an\nd\nSaturn by day, will benaturally fubjeft to the falling ficknefs all their\nlives; but, if Saturn happens to take this pofition by night, an\ndM\nars by\nday, the nativewill be fubject to phrenzy an\nd m\nadnefs, m\nore el'pecially\nif the afp\nedt fall in Cancer, Virgo, or Pifces. Again, if the M\noon,\nbeing in her phafis, is overcom\ne by m\nalefic rays, nam\nely, by the con\u00ad\ncurrence of Saturnw\nhenapproaching toanew, or by M\nars at her full,\neither in the figns Sagittariuso\nr Pifces, w\nhoever is b\nornunder fuch con\u00ad\nfigurations will befubject to lunacy. Therefore the m\nalefic flars, over\u00ad\ncom\ning or predom\ninating in any configuration, induce a variety of\nm\nental difeafes, which a\nreeither rem\narkably violent, or obfeure an\nd la\u00ad\ntent, accordingto the naturean\ndenergyof eachrefpeC\ntive rulingplanet.\nIf the benevolent planets Jupiter and Venus have fam\niliarity, in ori\u00ad\nental pofttions, an\nd angular, with the m\nalefics occidentally pofited,\nthefe m\nental difeafes, though ftrong and violent, will be curable; if\nJupiter prefidcs, they will be m\noved by m\nedical help; but, if Venus,\nby the natural flrength of the m\nental faculties. But, if thefe portions'\nhappen to be reverfed, the m\nalefic flars angular, an\nd in oriental ilations,\nan\ndthebenefics fetting, the difeafes will becom\ne m\nore m\nanifeil, an\nd\nbe wholly incurable. Hence w\ne derive the caufe of the ever-varying\nm\nutation of theanim\nal fpirits, which are alw\nays m\nore or lefs affed\nted\nin proportionas M\nercuryan\nd the M\noon areagitated by the good or evil\nin\nfluen\ncesof otherconcurringan\ndadjuvant cau\nfes.\nSuch\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 44s\nSuchare the m\norbid affr\u00e9tions in the adlive part of the rational foul,\nproduced by the planetary configurations, but the great change which\narifes in the patient, that is, in the irrational part of the foul*, is in\u00ad\nduced chiefly fromexcefs or defe\u00e9t, according to the particular confor\u00ad\nm\nation ofm\naleor fem\nale, in whichtheyeitherexceed, or are deficient, in\nthe parts propertotheir fex. For it isfound, that, iftheSunbeconfigu\u00ad\nrated with the M\noon in the place ofM\nercury, an\nd M\nars an\nd Venus h\natfe\nfam\niliarity with them\n, the lum\ninaries being in m\nafculine figns, the\nm\nen will exceed in that which is natural, having thofe parts inexcefs\nthat are proper to m\nan; an\nd the w\nom\nan will have a conform\nation of\nparts preternatural an\nd m\nixed. But, if M\nars an\nd Venus fhould be one\nor both conftituted with them after a m\nafculine m\nanner, the m\nen will\nbe fubjeft to m\nixtures of fex, an\nd the w\nom\nen to violent lull an\nd intem\n\u00ad\nperate w\nantonnefs. If Venus alon\ne be difpofedafteram\nafculinem\nanner,\nthis fenfation will be lefs ftrong, an\nd the parties will conduct them\nfelves\nwith m\nore decency and m\nodefty; but, if M\nars an\nd Venus both are fo\nconflituted, they will be m\noved to carnal em\nbraces by the m\noil violent\nan\nd irrefiftible fenfations.\nIf thelum\ninaries aloneareconfigurated in fem\ninine figns, the w\nom\nen\nthen born will beof im\nm\noderate conform\nation, and will have ftrong and\ncontinual d\nefires afterm\nen; but the m\nen then born will be changed to\nthat conform\nation which is inferior tonature, an\nd will inherit a\nn effe\u00ad\nm\ninate an\nd ten\nder conftitution of body an\nd parts. And, if Venus be\ndifpofedwith themin afem\ninine m\nanner, the w\nom\nen will be m\nore la-\nfeivious an\nd pron\ne to veneryj and, in w\nhatever line of life they chance\nto glide, this paflion will alw\nays be prodom\ninant, an\nd m\noil probably\nlubje\u00e9t themto difgraceand infam\ny.

And, if thofe ftars, which are\nof the famenature with thefignificator of the Part of Fortune, give tefti\u00ad\nmony of dominion, the poffeffion will remain with the native; but, if thofe\nof a contrary quality are elevated above the lord which has dominion, the\npoiTefiion will be of no duration, and future riehca precarious.

W\nherefore, if both the lum\ninaries at the tim\ne of\nbirth a\nre found in m\nafculine figns, angular, an\nd attended by the five\nplanets, the Sun by oriental ftars, an\nd the M\noon by occidental, thofe\nperfons will afpire to extraordinary pow\ner an\nd dignity, an\ndexercifeau\u00ad\nthority and dom\ninion over others, fromw\nhence great tribute an\nd ho\u00ad\nnour will flow.

Saturn is found to deftroy the ben\nefits of anactive pro\u00ad\nfeifion by tardin\nefs, indifference, an\nd ina&ivity: but M\nars through\nboldnefs, loftinefs, an\nd prefum\nption; w\nherefore both aft in oppofition\nto th\ne fuccels an\nd advan\ntage of the native\u2019s profeifion. But the general\ncau\nfes of the failure or profperity of buiinefs m\nuft b\ne judged of from\nthe difpofition an\nd quality of the ftars which produce this effeft; and\nthis in referen\nce to th\ne orien\ntal a\nn\nd occidental angles. The eaft angle\nden\notes the beginning of life; the w\neft angle the end; an\nd th\ne m\nid\u00ad\nheaven the m\niddle part, from about thirty to forty years: an\nd, a\ns the\nfignificators a\nredifpofed in th\ne rad\nical figure, fo will the effe&\ns thereof\nbeat the fet tim\ne of life conform\nable thereto.\nIt m\nuft b\ne ever rem\nem\nbered that the doftrine of profeifions h\nere laid\ndow\nn, an\nd the effects arifing fromthem\n, relates only to fuch a\ns a\nre fol\u00ad\nlow\ned inconfcquence of the n\natu\nral im\npulfeof them\nind; inw\nhich cafes\nalone w\ne a\nre to feck for adequate fuccefs an\nd perfection in the profecu-\ntion of them\n.

This I think is afa\u00a3\nt that n\need\ns n\nofurther illuftration,\niince the obfervations of mod m\nen will furniih them with inftances of\nperfons being regularly bred to fom\ne profeffions, which evenat anad\u00ad\nvancedtim\ne of life theywholly abandon, inpurfuit of fom\neothercalling\nm\nore confonant to their nature andabilities, an\nd in which they often\nfucceed, to the aftoniihm\nent totheir com\npetitors.\nOf M A R R I A G E .\nTo what h\nas been faid follows the confideration of m\narriage, or the\nfit conjunflion an\ndliving together of m\nan an\nd w\nom\nan, according to the\ndivineordinanceof thefuprem\ne Being. And, a\ns this law w\nas evidently\neitabliihed fromthe beginning of things, a\ns well for the propagation of\nthe fpecies asforthe m\nutual com\nfort an\nd happinefs of the fcxes, it w\nere\nfenfelefsto fuppofehum\nan n\nature void of the im\npulfe of reciprocal love;\northattheinvoluntaryaftionsofthefoul, byw\nhich itism\novedtow\nardsthe\nobjedt of its affedtions, have not a radical caufe in the order of nature.\nIf this be adm\nitted, it cannot furely be deem\ned a fubjedt of ridicule, to\nbelieve that this, a\ns well a\ns the other im\nportant tran\nfad\ntion\nsof ourlives,\nm\nay be fought out by acontem\nplation of the celeftial bodies.\nTo inveftigate this point, therefore, in refpcdt to m\nen, let the pofi-\ntions and conftitutions of the M\noon be particularly confidered. For,\nw\nhen the is found in the oriental quadrants at'the tim\ne birth, ihe\ninfluences the native to the confum\nm\nation of m\narriage at anearly period\nof his life; but, if pofitedin the occidental quadrants, he will probably\nlive Angle till the approach of old age, an\nd then m\narry avery young\nwom\nan. If the M\noon be afilidted by the Sun-beam\ns, an\nd in configura\u00ad\ntion with Saturn, in eitherof thefe pofitionsthe nativewill neverm\narry\nat all. If ihe be found in afign of on\ne form\n, an\nd m\nakingapplicationto\none planet only, the native will m\narry but once; but, if pofited in a bi\u00ad\ncorporal or fign of m\nany form\ns, and m\naking application to feveral ftars\nin the fam\ne fign, he will be feveral tim\nes m\narried. And, if the ftars\nwhich receive the M\noon\u2019sapplication, eitherbyaconjunction, fextile, or\ntrine, are bencfic, the w\nives will begood an\nd virtuous; but, if the ap\u00ad\nplication be m\nade to m\nalefic planets, an\nd by evil configurations, they\nwill be altogether of an oppofite defcription. Therefore, if Saturn re\u00ad\nceives the M\noon\u2019s application, it indicates alaborious, but fullen, fro\u00ad\nw\nard, and ungovernable, wife. If it be m\nade to Jupiter, ihe will befree,\nopen, andgenerous, truly virtuous, an\nd a good houfewife. If to M\nars,\nihe\n\f45+ A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nflic will be bold, ftubborn, an\nd refraftory. If to Venus, cliearful,\ncom\nplacent, affable, an\nd chafte. If toM\nercury, wife, prudent, loving,\nan\nd conflant. But, if M\nars irradiates the place, fhe will be furly, paf-\niionate, talkative, an\nd unfteady.\nFor the particulars of m\narriagein refpeft ofw\nom\nen, w\nearetoconiider\nthe poiitions of the Sun, in\nftead of theM\noon ; for, if he be fituated in\nthe oriental houfes, at thetim\ne of birth, the native will eitherm\narryvery\nyoung, or elle at a\nnadvanced tim\neof life to ayoung m\nanj but, if the\nSun be found in the occidental houfes, fhe will m\narry late, or to am\nan\nfar advanced in years. And alio, if he be fituated in afignof oneform\n,\nfhe will m\narry but once; but, if inafign of m\nanyform\ns, orconfigurated\nto m\nany oriental ftars, fh\ne will have m\nore hufhands than one, w\nho will\npartake of the fam\ne n\nature an\nd qualities a\ns the ftars to which the confi\u00ad\ngurations are m\nade. Thus, Saturn, if configurated to the Sun, will\nindicate fober, grave, an\nd laborious, hufbands, but cold an\ndphlegm\natic.\nJupiter difpofes themto m\nore opennels of m\nind, an\ndgenerolity. M\nars\nm\nakes them violent, w\narm\n, unruly, paflionate, an\nd arbitrary. Venus\nforeihew\ns them to be indulgent, fond, good-natured, an\nd handfom\ne.\nM\nercury difpofes themto be careful, prudent, induftrious, an\ndfaithful.\nBut, if Saturn be joined with M\nercury, they will be churlifh an\nd re-\nferved; if with Venus, they will bedull, four, an\ndinconftant: if with\nM\nars, quick, lively, luftful, an\nd fondof variety. Thofe are here to be\nconfidered the oriental quarters in refpedt of theSun, which precedethe\noriental an\nd occidental fign of the zodiac ; and, in refpeil of the M\noon,\nthole from her new and full to her other quarters and the occidental\nhoufes a\nrethofe which fall oppofite to theforegoing.\nAs to events that occur after m\narriage, that is adifferent fpeculation,\nan\nd requires greatattentionto the following particulars. W\nhenever the\ngeniture of both huiband an\nd wife have the lum\ninaries configurated in\nm\nutual agreem\nent, that is, in trine or fextile to eachother, they will\nlive together in com\nfort and harm\nony, an\nd for a long continuance of\ntim\ne, if thelum\ninarieshappento be in m\nutual reception. And this du\u00ad\nration will ftill be m\nore firmand lafting, if thepoutionof thehufband\u2019s\nM\noon agrees with that of the Sun in the wife\u2019s geniture. But, if the\npofitions of the lum\ninaries a\nre placed in figns inconjun6t, andconfigu\u00ad\nrated by quartile or oppofition, they will either live together in difeord\nand enm\nity, an\nd be rent by violent jealoufies an\ndcontention, or elfe be\nfully an\ndfinally eftranged fromeachother.\nA\ng\na\nin\n,\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 455\nAgain, if the beneiic rays of the fortunateplanetsbehold the configu\u00ad\nrations of the lum\ninaries in m\nutual reception, the m\narriage will be\ndurable, conftant, happy, and profitable; but, if the m\nalefic planets\nirradiate thofe places, the m\narriage will be unhappy, contentious, an\nd\nm\niferable. If the lum\ninaries are not configuratedin m\nutual reception,\nyet if the benefics give teftim\nony to them\n, the m\narriage will be m\node\u00ad\nrately happy an\nddurable; and, w\nhen ftrife an\nd difagreem\nents happen,\nthe fam\ne will w\near off, an\nd reconciliation w\nill take place betw\neen them;\nbut, if the m\nalefics give teftim\nony to the difcordant pofitions of the lu\u00ad\nm\ninaries, inconftancy and infidelity will eniue, an\nd the m\narriage will\nbe difT\nolved with S\ncan\nd\nal an\nddifgrace. If M\nercury be joined w\nith the\nm\nalefics, the S\nep\naration will be for hatred and diilike, and by m\nutual\nconfent; but, if Venus gives teftim\nony to them\n, it will beadivorce, by\nduecourfe of law, for infidelity an\nd adultery.\nM\narriages, in other refpe&s, areconfidered from the fam\niliarities and\nconnexions of Venus, M\nars, an\nd Saturn. For, if thefe are all three\nconfigurated with the lum\ninaries, the m\narriage will be good, dom\neftic,\nan\nd profitable; by reafonof the affinity which the benefic planet Venus\nhath with M\narsandSaturn; with M\nars, becaufeof youthan\ndfloridcoun\u00ad\ntenance, feeing they have exaltation in m\nutual trigonal figns, a\nsM\nars in\nCapricorn the triplicity of Venus, an\nd Venus in Pifces the triplicity'\nof Mars; or M\nars in Pifces the exaltation of Venus, an\nd Venus in\nCapricorn the exaltation of M\nars. So likewife Capricorn an\nd Libra are\ncom\nm\non to Saturn an\nd Venus; for Venus in Libra hath houfe, andSa\u00ad\nturn triplicity; and in Capricorn Saturn hath houfe, and Venus tripli\u00ad\ncity ; an\nd hence (h\ne b\nears relation to Saturn by an older com\nplexion,\nfeeing they have their houfes trigonal to each other. W\nherefore Venus\nwith M\nars conduces to m\nake the inclinations m\nore fond and am\norous;\nand M\nercury, giving teftim\nonyto them\n, qualifies the paffions, and keeps\nthe fenfual appetite within rational bounds.

The\nMoon, Jupiter, an\nd Venus, arc the givers of children; but the Sun,\nM\nars, an\nd Saturn, occasionilerility, or paucityof children.

I have therefore calculated aTable of them to\nevery degree of the Ecliptic for the latitude of London, which, being\nm\noft w\nanted, will of courfe fave the practitioner fom\ne trouble. U\nnder\nthe different latitudes in the other Tables, a\nrc fpecified the fem\nidiurnal\narches of all the northern figns, proper to thofe latitudes; a\ns Aries,\nTaurus, an\nd Gem\nini, at the top of the Table; an\nd Cancer, Leo, an\nd\nVirgo, at the bottom of the Table.

So likew\nife the fem\ninodturnal arch\nes for all the iouthern figns\nare placed under the different latitudes in the Tables, having Libra,\nScorpio, an\nd Sagittarius, at the top of the columns; and'Capricorn,\nAquaries, an\nd Pifes, at the bottom; an\nd\n, toobtainthefem\nidiurnal arch\nes\ncorrefponding with them\n, ad\nd the am\nount of the fem\ninotturnal arch to\ntwelve hours, an\nd the fumwill b\ne the fem\nidiurnal a\nre\nfy required; m\nany\nexam\nples of which will beihewn hereafter.\nNo. 25. 6 D But,\n\f492 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nBut, ftiould the femidiurnal or feminodturnal* arches be required for\nany latitude not fpecified in the Tables, they may be found thus : Firft,\nfind the declination of the planet under the pole of birth ; and, if the-\ndeclination falls in any of the fix northern figns, add the difference o f\nAfcenfion to ninety degrees, and the fum w ill be the femidiurnal arch, in\ndegrees and minutes ; if the afcenfional difference be iubtra&ed from\nninety degrees, the remainder will be the femidiurnal arch. But, if the\ndeclination ftiould fall in either of the fix fouthern figns, then fubtradt\nthe difference of afcenfion from ninety degrees, for the femidiurnal arch ;\nand add the afcenfional difference to ninety degrees, for the feminodlur-\nnal arch. If the arches thus found are divided by fix, they will give\nthe horary times, or true length of the planetary hours; and, if divided\nby three, they will give the true diftance of one houfc, by. which method\nthe true divifion of all the houfes may be obtained, according to the\nrules of Ptolom y; two of which parts make a Textile, as appears more\nobvioufly by the Tabic of Mundane Afpects, wherein are fpecified all the\nafpeds that are made in the world.\nO f the T A B L E S of T W I L I G H T .\nThe ufe of thefe Tables, in bringing up the arches of diredlions, hath\nbeen already mentioned ; it will therefore be fufficient in this place to\ninform the reader how to make ufe of them. The firft column on the\nleft hand contains the parallels o f Tw ilight ; and the body of the Tables\nihews the diftance the Sun muft be from the eaftern or weftern angles, that\nis, from the afeendant or feventh houfe, to be in thofe parallels; therefore,\nwhenever thefe Tables are ufed for any calculations, the following me\u00ad\nthod muft be adopted : Take the oblique afcenfion of the afeendant\nunder the pole of birth, from whence fubtradt the oblique afcenfion of\nthe Sun, and the remainder will be its primary diftance, which is to be\nfought in the Tables as near as pofiible to that degree which the Sun is\nin; which being found, look in the column of Parallels of Tw ilight,\nand fee what parallel correfponds with it, for under that parallel the\narch of Tw ilight muft be taken; examples of which will hereafter be\nfrequently given.\nO f the T A B L E S of M U N D A N E A S P E C T S .\nThe firft column o f thefe Tables contains the femidiurnal and femi-\nnofturnal arches, from three to nine hours, calculated to every fix mi\u00ad\nnutes. In the next column, and oppofite to thefe arches, in a direft\nline, is the fpacc of the houfe that the femidiurnal or feminofturnal\n\u2022 arches\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 493\n' W \u00bb *\narches refpe&ively .give ; and in the fucceeding columns are arranged all\nthe mundane afpe&s anfwering thereto, truly calculated to the very de\u00ad\ngree and minute, which are fometimes twice as much as at others; and\nthe reafon is, becaufe the femidiurnal and feminofiurnal arches vary in\ntheir content to full that amount. '\nO f the T A B L E S of R I G H T A S C E N S I O N S .\nT o find the right afcenfion of a ftar, the longitude muft be given,\nwith which enter the left hand column of the table ; and under the fign\nand latitude at the top of the columns, in the angle of meeting, is the\nright afcenfion required. For example : Suppofe a planet to be pofited in\nten degrees of Aries, and to have two degrees north latitude ; enter the\ntables of right afcenfion with ten degrees of Aries, in the left-hand\ncolumn, and in the angle o f meeting, under two degrees of north lati\u00ad\ntude, will befound the right afcenfion thereof, viz. eight degrees twenty-\nthree minutes.\nO f the T A B L E S of D E C L I N A T I O N .\nT o find the declination of a planet, the longitude muft be given, with\nwhich enter the table of declinations on the left hand ; and in the column\nof longitude, againft the degree of longitude, is the declination fought. I f\nthe ftar hath latitude, either north or fouth, enter the tables under the\nlatitude, as the titles direit, always remembering that,' if the ftar be in\nCancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, or Sagittarius, the degrees of longi\u00ad\ntude to the left hand, beginning at the top of the tables, arc to be\ntaken; but, if the ftar be in Capricorn, Aquaries, Pifces, Aries, Taurus,\nor Cancer, then the degrees of longitude to the right hand, beginning\nat the foot of the table, muft be retorted to. Example : Suppole a ftar\nin ten degrees of Virgo, with one degree twenty-feven minutes north\nlatitude; I enter the table of declinations, finding Virgo in the head\no f the table; and againft ten degrees under one degree of latitude I\nfind eight degrees forty-feven minutes, and againft ten degrees under\ntwo degrees of latitude I find nine degrees forty-two minutes; the dif\u00ad\nference is fifty-five minutes. Then, for the part proportional agreeing to\nthe odd minutes of latitude, I fay, I f fixty give fifty-five, what fiball\ntwenty-feven give ? It gives twenty-five; which, added to eight degrees\nforty-feven minutes, leaves the declination of the point fought, nine de\u00ad\ngrees twelve minutes. But, if the ftar had been in twenty degrees of\nAries, I muft have entered at the foot of the table; and, having the\nfame latitude, the fame declination would emerge.\nO f\n\f4 9 +\na n i l l u s t r a t i o n\nOf the T A B L E S of the A S C E N S I O N A L D I F F E \u00ad\nR E N C E S of the P L A N E T S .\nThe afcenfional difference is a certain arch of diftance, between the\nright and oblique afeenfions o f any ftar or planet, in any degree of the\nEcliptic; and, to find it by the following Tables of Differences, obferve\nthe following rules. Enter with the degrees of declination on the left\nhand o f the Table, and under the circle of pofition in the head, in the\nco'mmon angle of meeting, with equation, will be found the afcenfional\ndifference required. Example : Suppofe a planet to have ten degrees of\ndeclination, and his circle o f pofition be fifty-one degrees forty-two mi\u00ad\nnutes j I enter with ten degrees on the left hand under the circle of fifty-\none degrees, and there I find twelve degrees thirty-five minutes ; but,\nhaving forty-two minutes more, I take the part proportional between\nfifty-one degrees and fifty-two degrees, viz.\nDeclination ten degrees latitude\nDifference\ndeg. deg. min\nSi 12 3 5\n5 2 * 3 3\n0 28\nThen I fay, by the rule o f proportion, If fixty give twenty-eight, what\nfhall forty-two, the odd minutes of the circle*of pofition, give ? It gives\ntwenty nearly; which, added to twelve degrees tnirty-fiveminutes, gives\nthe true afcenfional difference, twelve degrees fifty-five minutes of the\npoint fought.\nHaving obtained the afcenfional difference, the ufe o f it, in the art of\ndirc&ions, is as follow s: Firft, if the declination be north, fubtradt\nthe afcenfional difference from the right afeenfion, and the remainder\nwill be the oblique afeenfion ; but, if you add it to the right afeenfion,\nthe fum will be the oblique dcfcenfion. Secondly, when the declina\u00ad\ntion is fouth, add the afcenfional difference to the right afeenfion, and the\nfum will be the oblique afeenfion; but, if you fubtradl it from the right\nafeenfion, the remainder will be the oblique defeenfion. And note,\nthat the afcenfional difference is only of fervice when the planet or ilar\nhath latitude.\nOf\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 495\nO f the T A B L E S of O B L I Q U E A S C E N S I O N S for,\nthe L A T I T U D E of L O N D O N .\nEnter thefe tables-with the degrees of longitude in the left-hand co\u00ad\nlumn and in the common area, under the fign in the top o f the column,\nis the true oblique afeenfion fought. For example, fuppofe the ftar to\nbe in ten degrees o f Aries, and the latitude of birth fifty-one degrees\nthirty- two minutes; look for ten degrees in the fide column under Aries\nin the head, and the oblique afeenfion will be four degrees ten minutes\nof the point fought. -\nT o find the oblique defeenfions by thefe tables, obferve the following\nrule: take the oppofite fign and degree, and, if it fall in any of the fix\nnorthern figns, add one hundred and eighty degrees to the oblique afeen\u00ad\nfion found, and the fum will be the oblique defeenfion of the point fought;\nbut in the fix fouthern figns fubtradion muft be made, and the ob\u00ad\nlique de&enfion remains. Exam ple: in the latitude of fifty-one de\u00ad\ngrees thirty-two minutes, I would know the oblique defeenfion o f ten\ndegrees of Libra. Now I take the oppofite point Aries, which is nor\u00ad\nthern, and add thereto one hundred and eighty degrees, as follows:\ndeg. min.\nOblique afeenfion of ten degrees of Ariesis 4 10\nAdd 180 o\n184 10\nThus the oblique defeenfion o f ten degrees o f Libra is one hundred\nand eighty-four degrees ten m inutes; but, for the oblique defeenfion of\nten degrees o f Aries, I take the oblique afeenfion of the oppofite point\nLibra, which is fouthern, and fubtrad one hundred and eighty degrees\nfrom it, as follow s:\ndeg. min.\nOblique afeenfion o f ten degrees o f Librais 194 12\nSubtrad 180 o\n14 12\nThus the oblique defeenfion of ten degrees of Aries is fourteen de\u00ad\ngrees twelve minutes $ and the fame rule will hold good in all fimilar\nNo. 2^. 6 E operations\n\f496 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\noperations for the latitude of London. I \u00bfhall likewife give a praxis for\niinding-the oblique afcenfions and defceniions of every other latitude, by\nhelp of the aforementioned Tables o f A fcenftonal Differences.\nIt would be needlefs to enter into any further explanation, or to adduce\nother examples in this place, to (hew the nature and ufe of the following\nfct of tables, ftnce we (hall hereafter have frequent occafion to refer to\nthem in calculating and bringing up the directions of the following\nNativities, which will at once prove the facility and correctnefs with\nwhich any calculations may be found by them, and initiate the young\npractitioner into a more intimate knowledge of them, without labour or\nembarrailment. W hat I have already premifed on the fubject, has been\nmerely to demonftrate their general expediency, and to remove thofe fug-\ngeftions of difficulty and difguft, which are too frequently felt by\ncommon readers upon the frit fight of a collection o f tables, from an\nill-founded apprehenfion that they ihall never be able to underitand\nthem ; and which confequently is apt to give a fatal blow to the further\nprogrefs of the itudent. Now the fame objections might be made with\nequal propriety to the ufe of the Trader\u2019s Sure Guide, and the Ready\nReckoner, fince both of them confiit of nothing but tables, calculated\nto ihew the value of any quantity of goods at any given price, and are\nnow univerfally made ufe of by perfons wholly unacquainted with the\ntheory of figures. If, therefore, thefe books can be ufcd with fo\nmuch advantage for the above-mentioned purpofes, by perfons utterly\nincapable of performing the moil fimple rules in addition or multipli\u00ad\ncation, why may not the following tables be reforted to with fimilar\neafe, for folvingany queftions upon the fubjeCt before us ? the anfwer is\nobvious, and the utility of the plan unexceptionable.\nA T A B L E\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 497\nA T A B L E of Semidiurnal and Seminofturnal A R C H E S .\nPole of 44degrees.

The diurnal motion of the Moon is thirteen degrees\nthree minutes, and the motion of Saturn three minutes. Now, as Siturn\nis retrograde,rhis motion is to beadded to the Moon's,#\nand then the di\u00ad\nurnal excels makes thirteen degrees twenty-one minutes, with which\nenter the table of logarithms ; in the top column feek thirteen degrees,\nand in the firft column on the left hand fide feek twenty-one minutes, and\nand in the angle of meeting will be found - - 6527\nIn the fam\ne m\nanner feek the logarithm to the difference\nof longitude, viz. three degrees three minutes, which\nwill be - . . . - 12279\nSubtract the lefs from the greater, and the re\u00ad\nmainder is - - - - - - 5752\nWith which lumber enter the logarithms, and on calling the rye up\u00ad\nwards will be found in the third column from the top fix hours, and iu\nthe fecond column on the left hand will be found twenty-two minutes\ntwenty four feconds.

The San m\noves in thezodiac only, an\ndm\neets all bodies or afpeds\ntherein, it being his unalterable courfe, that is, without latitude; b\n.u\nt,\nw\nhen he is directed to a planet or zodiacal parallel with latitude, it is\nthen called adire&ion in m\nundo; but, w\nhen direfted to a planet without\nlatitude, it isterm\ned a zodiacal diredion, andis either direct or converfc,\nasthe m\notion of the planet is either with, or contrary to, the fucceffion\nof figns.\nX. The Moon m\neets all rays in the circle of latitude in which fhe\nconftantly m\noves, an\nd that is alw\nays out of the ecliptic, except w\nhen\nihe is in her n\nodes 5 an\nd therefore, w\nhen ihe is directed, a\ns aligrtm\ncator\nwith latitude, to a prom\nittor in the zodiac, the latitude of the m\noon\u2019s\nplace m\null befound. Under this latitude, thedeclination mull be fought,\nwhich (hew\ns the oblique afcenfion or defcenlion under the pole of the\nM\noon 5 an\ndhence the arch of diredion is corre6H\ny found, by fubtrad-\ning the obliqueafceniion or defcenlion of the M\noon under her pole, not\nforgetting that this oblique afceniion or defcenlion m\null h\ne taken ac\u00ad\ncording to thelatitudeofher place at the hour of birth. This is called\na zodiacal direction withlatitude ; but, w\nhen theM\noon is diretied toan\nafped without latitude, the place of the zodiac w\nhere the afpcft falls\nis tobe taken without latitude, both in right afceniionand declination ;\nand thus find the oblique defcenlion or afcenfion of the point under the\npoleofthe M\noon; fromwhichfubtrad theobliqueafceniionordefcenlion\nof the M\noon, taken according to the latitude Ih\nehadat the tim\ne of birth,\nand the arch of diredion is found, which is to be converted into years\nas before.\nXI. Diredions areof two forts, zodiacal an\ndm\nundane. The Sun and\nM\noon are capable of being direded both w\nays ; but the angles ofafigure\ncan only be direded in m\nundo, they being fubjed to the accidents and\ndivilion of no circles but thofe which conllitute the m\nealurc of each\nquadrant, an\ndare m\neafured by the parts of the diurnal an\nd fem\ninodurnal\narches $ therefore they never m\neet any rays with latitude but bodiesand\noppolitions.\nXII. The m\nid-heaven an\nd afeendant are two different * circles.
