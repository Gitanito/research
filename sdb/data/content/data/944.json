Monthly\r\n Los Angles, CA.  Editor: Franklin H. Heald, editor and proprietor.\r\n 1\/1, December 1900.  $1.00 a year.\n\n Advertised in The Mountain Pine, 1907 and 1908, and in The Adept, February 1911, and noted in H.O. Severance, A Guide to the Current Periodicals and Serials of the United States (1909).  An advertisement for the journal in the Adept offered as a premium with each subscription a turquoise (1 to 3 1\/2 carats) from Heald's own mine.  He was a wealthy and idiosyncratic man whose goal was to convince the world of Newton's errors about gravity and to show the regular progression of the planets from the periphery towards the sun.  He combined these with an interest in New Thought.\n\n       Issues:Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V1 N12 Oct 1902  Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V2 N1 Nov 1902 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V2 N2 Dec 1902   Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V3 N1 Jan 1903 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V3 N3 Nar 1903 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V3 N5 May 1903 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V3 N6 Jun 1903 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V3 N7-9 Jul-aug-sep 1903 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V3 N10-12 Oct-nov-dec 1903   Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V4 N1 Jan 1904 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V4 N2 Feb 1904 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V4 N3 Mar 1904 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V4 N4 Apr 1904 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V4 N5 May 1904 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V4 N6 Jun 1904 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V4 N7 Jul 1904 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V4 N8 Aug 1904 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V4 N9-11 Sep-oct-nov 1904 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V4 N12 Dec 1904   Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V5 N1 Jan 1905 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V5 N2 Feb 1905 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V5 N3 Mar 1905 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V5 N4 Apr 1905 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V5 N5 May 1905 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V5 N6 Jun 1905 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V5 N7-8 Jul-aug 1905 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V5 N9 Sep 1905 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V5 N10 Oct 1905 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V5 N11-12 Jan 1905   Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V6 N1 Jan 1906 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V6 N2-3 Feb-mar 1906 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V6 N4-5 Apr-may 1906 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V6 N6 Jun 1906 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V6 N7 Jul 1906 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V6 N8 Aug 1906 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V6 N9 Sep 1906 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V6 N10 Oct 1906 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V6 N11 Nov 1906 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V6 N12 Dec 1906   Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N1 Jan 1907 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N2 Feb 1907 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N3 Mar 1907 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N4 Apr 1907 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N5 May 1907 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N6 Jun 1907 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N7 Jul 1907 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N8 Aug 1907 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N9 Sep 1907 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N10 Oct 1907 Higher Science Of Motion Of Matter V7 N11-12 Nov-dec 1907      <\/p>\n\n  \r\nIAPSOP materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License. \r\n IAPSOP respects people's privacy and personal data rights.             <\/HTML>\n\n[1] http:\/\/iapsop.com\/archive\/materials\/higher_science_of_matter","_id":944}
