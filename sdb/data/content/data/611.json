J. WOOLLEY.\nThe experiment to be described in this paper was origin-\nally suggested to me by Mr. E. J. Dingwall. Its object\nwas twofold. The first object was to discover whether\nany evidence could be obtained of the telepathic trans-\nmission of ideas to strangers knowing nothing of the agents\nexcept that thej were in a certain place at a certain time.\nIn the second place I hoped that, if there should be any\nevidence of such transmission in a few cases, it might\nbe possible later to conduct more detailed experiments\nwith the successful percipients, and so to gain information\nregarding telepathic processes and the conditions under\nwhich they go on.\nThe Nature of the Experiment.\nThe experiment consisted in the production by me to\nthe agents at five-minute intervals of five different objects\nin succession. At these times Sir Oliver Lodge at the\nmicrophone directed the wireless listeners to record any\nimpressions they were able to form of the objects so\nproduced. The agents and I were in the Society's office,\nwith no means of communication with anyone outside it.\nSir Oliver Lodge was at 2 Savoy Hill.\nThe experiment took place on February 16, 1927.\nThe objects shewn were as follows :\nAt 11.15 p.m., a 2 of Clubs playing card, cut at the\ntime from an \" Arpak \" pack in which\nthis suit happens to be printed in green\n,\non a black background.\n\f2 V. J. Woolley. [part\nAt 11.20 p.m., a Japanese print. (Shown opposite.)\nAt 11.25 p.m., a bunch of three sprays of white HJac.\nAt 11.30 p.m., a 9 of Hearts playing card, cut at the\ntime from the same pack as No. 1, this\nsuit being printed in red and also on a\nblack background.\nAt 11.35 p.m., myself wearing a bowler hat and a grotesque\nmask.\nThese objects were chosen entirely by me and their\nnature was unknown to any other person till they were\nshewn at the times given above. In choosing them my\naim was that each one should be moderately familiar to\nall listeners, while it also had certain special peculiarities\nwhich were unlikely to be guessed by chance. I hoped\nalso to arouse in the agents some feeling or emotion in\naddition to a purely intellectual perception of the object\ndisplayed.\nThe only information given to Sir Oliver Lodge, and by\nhim passed on to the listeners, was that numbers 1 and 4\nwere playing cards of unusual design, and that number 2\nwas a picture. The Hsteners were also asked to record\nany emotions felt in connexion with the objects and any\nsensations other than the visual ones to which it was\nfeared they might limit themselves unless they were\nspecially asked to do more.\nFor the purpose of the experiment each object was\nshewn to the ' agents for 3 minutes, and an interval of\n2 minutes was then given in order to separate each test\nfrom the next and to minimise the results of small errors\nin the listeners' watches.\nThe listeners were asked to post their results to the\nSociety's Office as soon as the experiment concluded, and, if\npossible, to have the time of posting attested by a witness.\nThe agents remained on the Society's premises through-\nout the night, without access to a telephone, until after\nthe morning clearances of the letter-boxes had taken\nplace.\nThe Choice of Agents.\nWe know nothing of the conditions or process of Tele-\npathy, and a 'priori there was no reason for choosing one\n\f\f\f105] Broadcasting Experiment in Mass-Telepathy. 3\nagent rather than another. We can distinguish, however,\nbetween what we generally call \" good sitters \" and \" bad\nsitters \" when we have to deal with the results which\ndifferent people obtain when they have sittings with\nmediums. In default of any other criterion it seemed\nreasonable to choose those as agents whom we knew,\nfrom their recorded results, to possess the obscure quahty\nof being \" good sitters.\" By this term I mean people\nwho, when they \" sit \" with a medium, are usually told\nrather more than the average amount of verifiable facts\nwhich are definitely unknown to the medium. On the\nassumption that many of such facts are derived from\nthe sitter's mind, there seemed some reason to choose\nthese \"good sitters\"' rather than others as agents in this\nexperiment, and all of the agents fall into this class. They\nwere seven in number in addition to myself.\nStatistics of the results.\nIn all 24,659 answers were received, and it is con-\nvenient to deal first with the impressions recorded for the\ntwo playing card tests, namely numbers 1 and 4.\nThe complete tables, shewing how many times each card\nof the pack was recorded for each test, are given as an\nappendix to this paper. It is clear from these tables\nthat so far as the card tests go there is no evidence at\nall of any telepathic transmission. The relevant numbers\nare as follows :\nTest 1. 2 of clubs (correct) 190 records.\n- 9 of hearts 491 records.\nTest 4. 2 of clubs 145 records.\n9 of hearts (correct) 150 records.\nSince the 9 of hearts was not cut from the pack till\nten minutes after test 1 was over, the 491 records must\nhave been due to pure chance, and the other numbers\nwhich are well below this must be attributed to chance\nalso. The numbers of the guesses made of the various\ncards of the pack are, however, of considerable psycho-\nlogical interest in themselves, and also appear to have an\nimportant bearing on the results of most experiments in\n\f4 V. J. Woolley. [part\ntelepathy or clairvoyance where playing cards are used as\nexperimental objects. The peculiarities of these guesses\nappear at once on studying the tables and they may be\nsummarized as follows :\n{a) There is a strong tendency to choose an ace, especi-\nally the ace of spades.\n(6) There is a marked preference for odd-numbered cards\nas against even-numbered ones.\nIt follows from these facts that, in an experiment in which\ncards are used to test some supposed faculty of perception,\nthe chances against naming correctly a particular card\ncannot be assumed to be 51 to 1. There is a mental\npreference for aces and odd cards, and the chances will\nvary according to the card used.\nIt is this preference which has made it impossible in\nthis experiment to determine the numbers of correct\nguesses to be expected by chance. If a pack is cut at\nrandom the chances against any particular card being cut\nare 51 to 1. If a person is asked to name a card at\nrandom the chances against any particular card being\nnamed seem to be indeterminable. Thus we have no\ndefinite chance expectation with which to compare the\ncorrect guesses in this experiment other than the numbers\nof the incorrect guesses which I have quoted above.\nObject No. 2 was described to the listeners as a picture,\nand it is perhaps natural that the thoughts of most of\nthem were directed to well-known paintings or portraits\nof celebrities. It seems hardly worth while to tabulate\nthese results in detail.\nOnly five listeners gave \" a skull \" as the description\nof the picture, one adding the interesting detail that it\nrepresented a skull in a garden, and a sixth noted \" human\nhead.\" It seems, however, of some importance that, of\nthese six records, no less than three gave \" flowers \" for\nNo. 3, this being in fact the bunch of lilac.\nIn this test, white lilac was named by only three\nlisteners, one listener choosing mauve lilac.\nThe favourite choice was some kind of lethal weapon\nassociated with an emotion of fear. The following table\ngives the numbers of the various impressions recorded :\n\f105] Broadcasting Experiment in Mass-Telepathy. 5\nLethal weapon ----- 1394\nFlowers (not named, or named as\nother than lilac) - - - - 951\nWhite scented flowers - - - 85\nMusical instruments - - - - 920\nSkull 704\nIt seems probable from these numbers that a large\nnumber of listeners were influenced by the instruction to\nrecord emotion, or a sensation in addition to that of sight.\nThe lethal weapon and the skull are guesses at objects\ncalculated to rouse emotions of fear and horror, while the\nflowers and musical instruments are associated with sensa-\ntions of smell and sound respectively.\nIt seems likely, too, that some of the listeners, knowing\nof my medical qualification, may have guessed that I\nshould probably possess a skull, and might easily employ\nit as a rather unusual object for the purpose of this test.\nFor the purpose, however, of this paper, it is important\nto consider whether this choice of the skull by a number\nof Hsteners for object 3 can fairly be believed to have any\nrelation to the picture of a skull which constituted object 2.\nIn view of the normal reasons which may have ac-\ncounted for these guesses it is impossible to put forward\nthese figures as a proof of the occurrence of telepathy in\nour experiment, but it will be convenient to consider its\npossibility in more detail after dealing with the recorded\nimpressions in test 5.\nFor this test it will be remembered that the object\n-consisted of myself wearing a grotesque mask and a\nbowler hat. The purpose of the test was to produce\nfeeUngs of amusement.\nThe following are the numbers of listeners who recorded\nimpressions at all related to the object of the test ;\nImpressions of me ------ 5\nof some one present - - - 146\nof some one dressed up or mas-\nquerading ----- 236\nof masks or faces - - - - 73\nof hats - - - - - - 202\nFeeling of amusement ------ 499\n\f6 V. J. Woolley. [part\nThese numbers in themselves appear to me to have\nhttle meaning or importance, because there is no definite\nchance expectation with which to compare them.\nIt is possible, however, to compare the number of\ntimes that a given object is guessed correctly with the\nnumber of times that it is guessed incorrectly in relation\nto another test. In this way test 3 and test 5 should\neach provide a control experiment for the other, in the\nsame way as do tests 1 and 4 which I have dealt with\nabove, and it is the main purpose of this paper to suggest\nthat such a comparative method of experiment should\nalways be employed in all attempts to test faculties of\nclairvoyance and telepathy.\nThe following table, which, unfortunately, involves some\nrepetition, gives the numbers of guesses of given objects\nor feelings in relation to these two tests. For clearness\nI have underlined those numbers which may be called\nsuccessful guesses, which numbers should be compared\nwith the numbers of guesses of the same objects for the\nother test, and I have also added the numbers of guesses\nof certain widely chosen objects which had nothing to do\nwith either test.\nIII.

It seems to me to be probable that\nfor object 3 many Listeners guessed either a sound or a\nsmell, whence we get the musical instruments and flowers,\nwhile for object 5 guesses were much more equally distri-\nbuted over a large field.\nIt may, however, be argued that a better estimate of the\nresults could be obtained by noting the numbers of\nlisteners who gave two or more correct records. If the\nfaculty or process is limited to a smaU number of people,\nwe might expect to find a few sets of records with several\nsuccesses which would pass unnoticed in dealing with the\nstatistics of each test separately.\nThe numbers of such double successes were very smaU :\nindeed, in the case of the cards I believe that only two\nHsteners gave both correctly and in neither case was any\nmention made of the colours. In chance guessing one would\nexpect about ten such double successes for the card results.\nThe most successful set was perhaps as follows :\n1. Ace of Clubs.\n2. Skull m garden.\n3. Flowers.\n4. Coloured \" Snap \" card.\n5. Some black object.\nIn view of the number of listeners who gave the skull\nfor object 3, it may be worth while to quote some of\n\f8 F. J. Woolley. [part\ntheir comments, which in many cases are so made as to\npoint to a genuine perception rather than to a chance or\nreasoned guess.\n(a) II. A picture of an awful looking skull which I\nclearly saw and could not get rid of the whole of the\ntime and which seemed to rule all.\n(6) III. First impression was of a white ivory ball,\nimmediately succeeded by the impression that the object\nwas a human skull. It was still an ivory ball to my\nvision, but it seemed borne in on me that it was actually\na skull.\n(c) III. Skull and fear, and then stronger impression of\na flower.\n(d) III. Horror due to a skull replaced by pleasure and\ndelight of a beautiful flower.\nThese quoted records show I thinli the great difficulty\nof reaching any definite statistical result in tests of this\nkind. The tests with the playing cards are the only ones\nin which such a result is possible, and in these the figures\nI have given offer no support to the supposition that\ntelepathy is possible under these conditions.\nIn the other tests the results are much less clear.\nThere is certainly nothing which can be taken as a proof\nor even as a strong argument, but there does seem an\nindication of a supernormal faculty on the part of a few\nof those who took part, though their successes are swamped\nby the very large mass of failures on the part of others.\nI am glad to say that some of these successful hsteners\nare now collaborating with Mr. S. G. Soal and myself\nin a fresh series of similar tests which will form the\ncompletion of this experiment, and may possibly furnish\nmore definite results than this prefiminary and widespread\nattempt was able to do.\nIn conclusion, I have to express my very hearty thanks\nto aU those whose co-operation made the experiment\npossible. Among them I should fike specially to include\nthe British Broadcasting Corporation and its officials, Sir\nOHver Lodge who acted as announcer, the group of agents\nwho endured a rather comfortless night to obviate any\nchance of leakage of the results, and all those who helped\n\f105] Broadcasting Experiment in Mass-Telepathy. 9\nin the classification of the answers, especially Mr. S.

[part\nREVIEW.\nThe Bridge : a Case for Survival. Compiled by Nba Walker,\nwith a Prologue and an Epilogue by Sir Oliver Lodge.\nlUustrated. Pp. 314. Cassell & Co., Ltd. 1927. Price 21s.\nTpiis important book gives an account of attempted communi-\ncation and its gradual development between a Mrs. White and\nher deceased husband, with some further experiments after\nMrs. White's own death in 1924. The case has already been in\npart before members of our Society, for Sir Ohver Lodge (whose\nsecretary for psychical matters was and is Miss Walker, the com-\npiler) gave an outhne of it, quoting extracts from the evidence at\nan S.P.R. meeting in November, 1925. It deserves, however,\nmore serious study than an hour's discourse affords oppor-\ntunity for, and all who are really interested in psychical\nresearch will be well advised to read the book carefully, though\nthey will not find profitable study of it altogether easy nor\nprobably get from it sensational thrills.\nThere are two characteristics of the case to which special\nattention may be called. The first is that it is in a sense\ncomplete. The compiler has not only had before her fragments\nand episodes of apparent communication from Mr. White ; she\nis cognizant of all that Mrs. White experienced in that way\nor that was obtained on her behalf through mediums, and\nMiss Walker to a large extent herself directed the experiments.\nShe has very properly not given us in this volume full records\nof all the sittings and communications, nor even the whole of\nwhat has any apparent connexion with Mr. White. To have\ndone so would have drawn it out to inconvenient length and have\ninvolved unnecessary repetition and the inclusion of matter of\ndoubtful interpretation and uncertain evidential value. But Miss\nWalker herself has known it all and has only omitted for the sake\nof brevity what seemed irrelevant. To make the selection in such\na manner as to present the case adequately and fairly and in\n\f105] Review. 11\nas readable a form as possible, with the necessary comments\nand verifications, was not a very easy task, even with the\nassistance Mrs. White was able to give, and I should like to\ncongratulate Miss Walker on the success with which she seems\nto me to have accomplished it. I am to some extent a better\njudge of this than the ordinary reader, because I have seen a\nsomewhat larger portion of the records than appears in the\nbook.\nThe second and more important characteristic is that what\none may call the backbone of the case, from a research point\nof view, is a systematic and very successful attempt to get\nevidence in a form which eliminates the mind of the sitter as\na possible source of the knowledge shown by the communi-\ncator,\u2014knowledge of things of which the medium and sitter\nwere both ignorant. This was accomplished largely through\nsittings taken by Miss Walker as proxy for Mrs. White. Miss\nWalker who, as explained in the book, at first only knew Mrs.\nWhite by correspondence and knew nothing of her circum-\nstances and surroundings except that her husband had recently\ndied and that she was very anxious to feel in touch with him,\nsuggested that she (Mrs. W^hite) should ask her husband to\ncommunicate with her (Miss Walker), giving evidence of identity\nwhich could be subsequently verified. Mrs. White entered into\nthe experiment gladly and with results satisfactory to herself and\nvaluable to all students.\nThe following (see pp. 227-229) is an instance of the kind\nof result obtained\u2014in this particular case knowledge shown of\nMrs. White's thoughts. It occurred in the course of a sitting\ntaken with Mrs. Leonard by Miss Walker, on behalf of Mrs.\nWhite ; but Mrs. Leonard was not informed that Mrs. White,\nwho indeed was not known to her by name at all, was con-\ncerned in the matter. By the time the sitting in question\ntook place, however, Mrs. White had personally sat anony-\nmously with Mrs. Leonard several times with interesting results,\nso that it may be supposed that some sort of rapport had\nbeen estabhshed between them. Feda (Mrs. Leonard's well-\nknown control) speaking for Mr. White said among other things :\n\"... She wasn't very near the window, but she could se&\nfrom where she was. She was looking specially at a peculiar\nformation in the sky. And she wondered if it had any-\n\f12 Review. [part\nthing to do with us. He says, I'll put it this way\u2014if\nwe were there. If that had anything to do with our\nplace [in the other world]. And I tried to impress upon\nher, that, in a strange and peculiar way, it had to do\nwith us, and that she would not quite understand that\ntill later. ...\"\nMrs. White gives particulars of such an experience which\nshe had one Sunday evening before the sitting, and she had\nas a matter of fact, before she received the record of the\nsitting included in a hst of impressions, placed for evidential\npurposes in the hands of a friend, \" Thoughts in connexion\nwith a golden cloud\u2014is it where they are ?\n\" She was very\nill at the time and unable to write more fully. It must be\nadmitted that the corroboration of a friend is not always\nforthcoming as it is in this case. But of Mrs. White's bona\nfides there is no doubt and I do not think any reader of the\nbooli will question it.\nA single example such as I have given does not really repre-\nsent the case, for the effect of the evidence is cumulative. There\nwere numerous instances of apparent supernormal knowledge\n\u2014\nnot of course all of equal evidential value\u2014shown through\nvarious mediums, professional and private, concerning Mrs.\nWhite ;\nand after her death, concerning a friend of hers, Mrs.\nWhite herself being the ostensible communicator. Mrs. White,\nmoreover, with an ouija-board got some facts concerning Miss\nWalker and her sisters at a distance.\nThe attempt was made to obtain from Mr. White evidence\nof memory of things unknown to any living person. In\nparticular he on one occasion professed to describe a childish\nrecollection which may quite well have been true ; confirma-\ntion up to a certain point was forthcoming, but no one was\nfound who remembered the actual facts described. It is,\n\u2022of course, a well recognised difficulty in obtaining evidence\nof this type that if the alleged fact was known only to the\ndeceased communicator, it can seldom be verified.\nIt may be asked : In seeking evidence of survival, how does\nelimination of telepathy from the sitter help us if after all\nthe source of information is perhaps telepathy from a distant\nliving person ? There are two answers to this. The first is,\nthat it adds to our knowledge of telepathy, which is, I think,\n\f105] Review. 13\nthe most promising line of advance in psychical research.\nWe at present know extremely little about it, and if we\ncould discover its modus operandi, its conditions and its limits\nand possibilities, that would in itself greatly contribute to the\nunderstanding of questions of survival and communication with\nthe dead. One reason why this book is valuable is that it is\na distinct contribution to the study of telepathy.\nMy second answer is more direct. The communications here\nrecorded do not merely consist of statements of fact which\nturn out to be true. There is an atmosphere about them.\nA personality is presented which is like Mr. White, showing\nthoughts and feelings and associations of ideas like his, possess-\ning his memories apj^arently, and sometimes using his expres-\nsions. Mrs. White gradually became so strongly convinced that\nthis was so that she ceased to doubt that she was really in\ncommunication with her husband ; and I thinli any careful\nreader will feel this atmosphere. Now, though at present we\nknow little of the limits of telepathic power, it certainly would\nseem, other things being equal, prima facie more likely that a\nvivid and veridical presentation of a personahty is derived\nfrom the person represented than by telepathy even from the\nsitter, and still more so if the alternative is telepathy from a\ndistant person. But this argument assumes that communication\nfrom the dead is a possible alternative, and rigorous proof of\ncontinued memory and affection is not attainable without\nexclusion of telepathy from the living as a possible source of\ncommunications. There are, however, degrees of probabiUty,\nand accumulation of carefully examined evidence such as this\ncase affords would I think gradually produce practical convic-\ntion that the source is the minds of the dead. Nevertheless,\nwe rightly desire scientific proof of so momentous a conclusion\nand we must not relax our efforts to add to the evidence we\nalready have showing memory and intelligent action clearly\nindependent of minds still in the body ; for such evidence,\nadequate in amount, would furnish the proof required.\nI should like to call attention to two cmious instances of\napparent foreknowledge which occurred casually, as it seemed,\nin the course of the investigation\u2014though the subject of fore-\nknowledge is rather off the main line of the book. The first\noccurred at a sitting with Mrs. Leonard taken by Mrs. White\n\f14 Review. [part\nherself anonymously (see pp. 208, 9). The communicator\ntalked about the Quantock Hills in Somerset, where the Whites\nhad spent many holidays. Then after conversation about\nother matters, Feda said :\n' That place he spoke of\u2014the place you planned to go\nto again . . . You have a sort of picture or description of\nthat place. He's got such a strange feeling ; he feels\nyou're going to get another picture, sort of picture, quite\nby accident, you'll think it's a sort of coincidence.\"\nMrs. White annotates :\n\" Whilst sitting in the train in the evening at Padding-\nton, just after the sitting, with my friend [who corro-\nborates], and waiting for its departure, two ladies, one in\nthe carriage and the other standing on the platform, began\nto talk about the Quantocks. The one told the other of\na long stay she had had in a village where we had stayed\n. . . and finally gave a vivid description of the view from\nthe top of the hills, across the Severn sea to Cardiff.\"\nThe second prediction is even more definite and its fulfilment\nmore improbable (pp. 285, 6). The medium was Mrs. Warren\nElliott. The sitting took place after Mrs. White's death with\nno friends of hers present, but it was understood that com-\nmunication with Miss Walker was desired. Mr. Elliott, the\nhusband of the medium, kindly took the notes. Both Miss\nNea Walker and her sister Damaris (who has psychic powers,\nand had herself been one of the channels through whom Mr.\nWhite had appeared to communicate), were absent from home.\nTopsy (Mi's. Elliott's control) said :\n\"Spirit says . . . Dame (\n= Damaris) made cake, sort of\nspotted inside, and the blue fell in.\"\nWhen the record was sent to Miss D. Walker for comment,\nshe wrote :\n\" I made some pastry, but it must have been [some\ndays] later than the date of the sitting. The blue (blue\nfor blueing clothes) did fall into the basin.\"\nLater she added, in answer to further inquiries\n:\n\" It was pastry I was making. ... I filled the scraps\nwith a mixture of currants and brown sugar. ... It does\ngive a '\nspotty '\nappearance where you bite into it ; and\nT suppose they might be called small pastry cakes.\"\n\f105] h .Review.'. 15\nThere was no conceivable reason why the fall of the blue\nbag, or even its presence on the shelf from which it fell,\nshould have been anticipated by the persons concerned.\nI must not leave the impression that, successful as the\nexperiments were on the whole, the communications were all\nthat could be desired. As is generally the case with tele-\npathic communications, they are apt to lack the fullness which\nwe should expect in conversations between living persons face\nto face, and there are not only curious gaps and omissions,\nbut what is said is not always free from error. Even if we\nmay assume that the dead are able to be in complete touch\nwith us spiritually, and to know all our thoughts and actions,\nexperience seems to show that telepathic communication ex-\npressed in language is almost always incomplete and often\n\u2022confused. As Feda puts it on one occasion after Mrs. White's\ndeath (p. 273) :\n\" There's some slipping point between us\u2014what she was\ngoing to say, and what she tried to say, and found it\nwasn't given.\"\nAnother difficulty will be felt by some readers. There are\nin the course of the book attempts to describe things in the\nother world in terms of the material world we live in\u2014rooms,\ngardens, etc. E.g. on p. 146 Feda says for Mr. White :\n\" Tell her that in our house [in the other world] we\nhave everj^hing that she would hke, everything. ... He\nsays, tell her our piano is an Erard, but if she likes I'll\nchange it. That's what it is at present.\"\nCommon sense tells us that such descriptions, if they repre-\nsent anything beyond the fancy of Feda or other control,\n\u2022cannot be intended hterally. If students kept this in mind,\na difficulty in estimating the value of statements through\nmediums would perhaps be removed. A statement that the\nemotional effect of music is experienced on the other side\nwould, of course, whether true or not, be in a different cate-\ngory.\nMr. and Mrs. White were both very musical, and Mrs. White\nwas a good pianist. Her playing to him on the pianoforte\nwas an important featm-e in their married life. That appears\nclearly in the book, with many other intimate details of their\nlife together. The reader must be prepared for an atmosphere\n\f16 [part 105\nfull of tender sentiment and poetic ideas, in what Mrs. White\ncalls \" a true after-death love-story.\" The book is not merely\na dry description of a scientific investigation, though the\nsentiment has not been allowed in any way to interfere with\nthe carefulness of the investigation or the accuracy of the\nreport. Mrs. White left to Sir Oliver Lodge and Miss Walker\nall the psychic material, and the right to use it, including her\nmost intimate messages, as they thought best for the widest\npossible public.\n\" I would like the White case,\" she wrote, \" to be used\nto help others to realize that Love does conquer all\n\"\n(p. 12).\nWe owe a debt of gratitude to Mrs. White for thus allowing\nher inmost feelings to be revealed, and both to her and to\nMiss Walker for the trouble they have taken in presenting\nthe evidence in what undoubtedly is, as the title intimates,\n\" a case for survival,\" and a valuable one.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 106\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS\nBY\nSib Lawbence J. Jones, Babt.\n(This Address was delivered at a Private Meeting of the Society\non March 14, 1928.)\nWhen it was first intimated to me that the Council\nmight like me to act as their President during the coming\nyear. I was somewhat perturbed at the thought that this\nwould involve delivering a Presidential Address ;\nbut I\nthen remembered that since the passing over of Miss Kate\nWingfield last summer, the records of the many sittings\nwhich I had with her in the years 1900 and 1901 might\nwith the consent of her family be available as material.\nThat consent was readily given, and I propose now to\ngive a short account of these sittings.\nReaders of the Journal will be aware that in September\n1927 I revealed that Miss Wingfield was the \"Miss A\" of\nwhom Myers had written so much both in Proceedings\nand in Human Personality. I do not propose to repeat\nany part of what he has said as to Miss Wingfield 's\nwonderful niediumship. but to begin at once at the\nmoment when my wife and I were first admitted to the\ncircle. It was just about the time when Miss Wingfield's\nclairvoyance and automatic writing, which, assisted by\nraps and table tilting, had been the means through which\ncommunications were received, developed into trance\nmediumship.\n\f18 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [PABT\nMy wife and I had in 1898 lost our eldest boy at the\nage of fourteen after a short and severe attack of septic\npneumonia. And when by a combination of circumstances\nwhich did not at the time seem fortuitous we made the\nacquaintance of Mrs. Wingfield and her family who were\nthen living at Belvedere House, Wimbledon, we were\nnaturally attracted by the thought that some communica-\ntion might reach us with regard to the one who had\npassed on.\nI should add that at this time I had never sat with\nany medium, and knew nothing of spirit return beyond\nwhat had already appeared in Proceedings. I had been\nan Associate of our Society since 1888.\nThe sittings were strictly confined to Miss Wingfield's\nown family and a few intimate friends. Visitors were\nrarely admitted. Through a common friend whom I\nshall refer to as E. M. we were admitted to the circle\nand later became regular members of it. At first the\nsittings were held in the dark in order that Miss Wingfield\n(K. as I shall call her) might see clairvoyantly any spirits\nwho might be present.\nRaps were an invariable accompaniment of the sitting,\nand very often a table was tilted. After the sitting\nautomatic writing supplied an explanation of what had\nbeen seen and of the messages received through the\ntable. Later on K. used to go into trance and the\ncommunicator would speak through her. This was a\nfar more rapid and satisfactory means of communication,\nno laborious spelling out word by word through raps or\ntable tilting ; but the point to be noted is that it was\na development of what had already existed for many\nyears.\nIt was through E. M. that the development of this\nparticular form of communication was made possible, as\nshe formed a strong protection against the invasion of\nundesirable spirits.\nThe records of these sittings were made as follows :\nK.'s sister M. had learnt to write in the dark and\nwhen I was present I also took notes, using a slate with\nwires across it. We compared notes the next morning\n\f106] Presidential Address. 19\nand wrote out a fair copy in a MS. book. These books\nhave been preserved and have been the source of my\npresent address.\n\" Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem,\"\nis an admirable adage in Psychical Research\u2014the real\n^'\ncrux \" is where does \" Necessitas \" begin ? In the case\nof K.'s mediumship, I have extracted from the notebooks\ncovering the period May 1900 to November 1901 a list\nof 30 different \" Guides \" and 108 \" Communicators,\"\ntotal 138 separate entities. To attribute all these to\nK.'s powers of dramatic characterization is beyond my\nwildest flight of fancy.\nAt E. M.'s first sitting for table tilting in March 1900,\nK. became clairvoyant and described a man in blue clothes\nwith a peaked cap, standing by E. M. ; the table tilted\nout \" Herbert.\" E. M. remembered a much older brother\nHerbert who had died away from home when she was\na child, and who had been in the Navy.\n\" Can you be my brother Herbert ?\n\" The figure\nnodded and seemed pleased. On a later occasion. \" How\ndid you find me ?\n\" \" Your prayers had helped me and\nbrought me in touch with you.\"\nLater Herbert took charge of the Circle. A marked\nmasculine personality, with his own kindly and humorous\ncomments on the various communicators and on our\nmistakes in dealing with them.\nYou ask what I feel about Herbert ? If you had had\nover sixty conversations with someone behind a screen,\nand had always heard the same cheery manly voice and\nlistened to the same kindly humorous judgments of men\na,nd things\u2014coupled it may be with an occasional readi-\nness to answer fools according to their folly\u2014you would,\nI think, fully expect when the screen was withdrawn to\nfind a friend ready to welcome you. So I have no\ndoubt at all that when the time comes Herbert will prove\n-as good as his word.\nA striking contrast between K. and other mediums\nlay in the fact that she had no \" familiar spirit \"\u2014no\nPhinuit or Nellie or Feda\u2014no one to act as intermediary\nbetween the communicator and the sitters. Herbert\n\f20 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [part\nwas merely \" Master of Ceremonies.\" The sitting in-\nvariably began with his three quick raps, the sign that\nhe was present.\nWhen trance came on he would say a few words, and\nagain at the close, but he never interfered in the con-\nversations.\nIf we consider the space that has been devoted to the\nstudy of these trance controls in the various volumes of\nProceedings, we shall realize what an enormous gain it\nis to the communicators and to the sitters when this\n\" third party \" can be eliminated.\nThis partly accounts for the very large number of\ncommunicators quoted above. We have had as many\nas ten at a single sitting.\nHerbert's function was to regulate their entrances and\nexits and to see that K. was not physically affected\nby them.\nK.'s principal link with the outer world was through\nher doctor Guide Semirus. He was supposed to have\nbeen a doctor in ancient Egypt, but I do not know what\nwas the authority for this. He had a most peculiar\nscript, writing diagonally across the page beginning at\nthe top left-hand corner and running all his words in\ntogether, so that it was not easy to decij)her. At first\nsight he might have been supposed to be a secondary\npersonality of K., but an incident which was related to\nme by the family makes it impossible to hold that belief.\nOn one occasion a sitter came down to Wimbledon to\nget some information from Semirus, but when K. sat\ndown and called him there was no response. She tried\nagain after an interval and again a third time, but still\nno response. The sitter went away and K. was much\ndiscouraged, thinking that for some reason the power had\nleft her. Later in the day her hand was controlled\nand there was Semirus. He explained that he had heard\nher call, but was unable to come because he was assisting\nin an operation at X Hospital. The operation was\na new one that had not been performed before, and\nwas quite successful. A letter of enquiry to the Hospital\nwas answered to the effect that such an operation was\n\f106] Presidential Address. 21\nindeed in progress during the time of Semirus's absence\nand that the result was successful.\nAnother rather quaint incident strongly suggests an\nindependent personaUty. An old friend came down one\nday to Wimbledon to ask for a report on the health of\nhis aunt who lived in London. He gave the aunt's\naddress, and in a few moments Semirus was back saying\nthat the aunt was dead. Greatly surprised the sitter\nhurried back to find his aunt in her usual health. But\nas he waited on the door-step after ringing the bell, he\nrealized that by inadvertence he had given Semirus the\nwrong number ; let us say 28 instead of 29. A day or\ntwo later a funeral took place from the house to which\nhe had wrongly directed Semirus.\nThe striking thing about Semirus to my mind is not\nthe value of the diagnoses or advice that he gave, but\nin the incredible rapidity with which he was able to\ndiscover and report on a patient at a great distance.\nMy own personal experience of Semirus began on\nMarch 11, 1900, the occasion of our first visit to the\nWingfield family at Wimbledon. Having been offered\nby K. that Semirus should write for us, we asked him\nto go and look at our Eton boy who we had heard was\n\" staying out \" (in ordinary parlance \" staying in \").\nWe gave him the boy's name and address and, after a\npause, Semirus wrote, \" Yes, I have found the boy. He\nis a tall well-grown boy. I find he has had a slight\nchill on his liver, but nothing much ; but he will be\nall right again soon and is nearly so now. He wants a\ngood tonic.\" After that we got some advice about our\nyoungest child who was out at Valescure in the South\nof France.\nA more important communication came from Semirus\non June 2 of the same year. We were then at the\nBagni di Lucca intending to spend the summer in the\nAppennines. Our third boy was at a Preparatory School\nfor the Navy, near Maidenhead. The Headmaster very\nwisely had down Sir James Dick the former Director-\nGeneral of the Medical Department of the Navy. He\niiad inspected all the boys who would be candidates\n\f22 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [part\nfor the Navy, and had rejected Bertram at once on\naccount of his feet. On hearing this unwelcome report\nfrom the Headmaster I wrote to Sir James Dick to ask\nwhether anything could be done. Here is his reply :\n64 Welbeok Stkeet, W.,\nCavendish Square,\nMay 29, 1900.\nDeab Sir,\nIn reply to your letter, I am of opinion that your\nson would not be accepted as a Cadet. His feet are not\nwell-formed, and there is a contraction of short muscles\nof the sole and Planta-fascia, more especially of the right\nfoot, impairing his activity. Remedial measures might\nimprove them but not sufficiently I think to enable him\nto pass into the Navy. . . .\nOn the whole I should advise you to give up the idea\nof the Navy for him, and to select some career in Civil\nlife for which he is i^hysically quite fit.\nYours truly,\nJames Dick.\nBefore acquiescing in this advice we decided to consult\nSemirus, and wrote home to Wimbledon for his advice^\nThe message we received ran thus :\nI have been twice to see the boy. I cannot think\nthat it is incurable, it appears to me to be a contraction\nof the tendons that govern the muscles and I believe\nthat some really good surgeon can set it right. Of course\nI know it might be a six months' job for the feet would\nhave to be massaged and rubbed and strengthened after\nthe tendon was stretched. It seems to me that such a\nlittle thing would do it if the Doctor could be persuaded\nto. I see no reason he should not be quite ready for\nthe Navy in nine months' time.\nIn consequence of this advice the boy was taken to\nMr. Noble Smith who undertook to operate and straighten\nout the feet, but as the operation was a very delicate\none, only on condition that the parents came over to\nEngland and gave their personal sanction. We conse-\n\f106] Presidential Address. 23\nquently changed all our plans, came over to England,\nsaw Noble Smith, authorized him to carry out the opera-\ntion, which was entirely successful, and the boy passed\ninto the Navy with no difficulty the following March.,\nA critical examination of Semirus's words suggests that\nthis was really only a happy guess on his part. He uses\nthe words \" Surgeon and Doctor \" indiscriminately, and\none cannot tell whether he really understood what could\nbe done by up-to-date surgery. However, his advice to\nconsult a surgeon was perfectly sound, and enabled the\nboy to enter his profession.\nAfter that Semirus became for a year or two what\nmay be called our family doctor for the minor ailments\nof a large family. I do not see any trace of deep know-\nledge of either surgery or medicine ; he is rather of the\ntype of an old-fashioned country doctor using homely\nremedies. Here is his remedy for a cold in the head :\n\" What you had better do is to steam your head over\nhot water and ammonia and then put a flannel right\nover your head, and go to sleep, and take a really big\nglass of hot water, lemon and whisky, and do not be\nsparing of the spirit.\" I have a note to this. \" Tried\nand found quite successful and the following day we had\na picnic up at the Malpey.\"\nHere is an occasion when Semirus's advice was of\npractical use to us. In the summer of 1901 a house\nhad been taken for us for a few weeks in a small country\ntown near the East Coast. We had been there two or\nthree weeks when K. and E. M. came down to stay.\nThey were not very happy about the drainage, and the\nmorning after they arrived Semirus was consulted. He\nwrote:\nI strongly advise you not to remain in this house any\nlength of time. I do not like the situation in regard\nto health. All the groimd under the house is saturated\nwith sewage, it will get into the system and come out\nin many ways. My strong advice is not to remain\nlonger than is necessary, I do not consider it sanitary.\nOpen doors and windows are no use, as the evil comes\nfrom below under the house. It is most unwholesome,\n\f24 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [part\nmost. My disinterested advice is do not stay longer than\nyou can help. Children brought up in the house do not\ntake any harm, as their blood is saturated with the atoms ;\nbut fresh persons with good blood coming in are much\nmore liable to be affected. You can draw no argument\nfrom the health of the residents.\nIn consequence of this advice we went the next morning\nto a sea-side town a few miles off, took a house there for\nthe following day, and as soon as we had moved sent\nover a sanitary expert who pronounced the drainage\nsystem as bad as it could be ; all joints leaking and the\nhouse full of sewer gas.\nSemirus wrote for K. all through her life, and more\nthan one doctor consulted him again and again so that\nhis diagnoses in obscure cases must have been of value.\nSemirus never would give a prescription to be made\nup at a chemist's, on the ground that he was not a\nqualified Medical Practitioner.\nIn the case of a skin affection he once excused himself\nfor failure to make a satisfactory diagnosis, on the ground\nthat he could not touch the affected part. The only\nquestion he would ask before starting on his journey was\nwhat limb or organ was to be inspected.\nThe script was always handed over to the sitter, and\nK. knew nothing of its content, except when she was\nasked to help to decipher it.\nTo return to our sittings. I should here explain that\nthe purpose of these sittings was a most serious one.\nMainly to obtain light and teaching on the mysteries of\nlife and religious problems ; but also at the instigation\nof some of the controls to afford a meeting place for those\nwho having j^assed over had not yet succeeded in meeting\neach other. This sounds very strange but it is the only\nintelligible explanation of the number of dramatic situa-\ntions which unrolled themselves as the sittings went on.\nAs assistance to those in darkness and isolation was\nthe purpose and not identification or corroboration of\ntheir stories, it is rare that proof can be offered of the\nreality of what took place ; but on one occasion identity\n\f106] Presidential Address. 25\nwas, so to speak, forced upon us and of this I propose\nto speak in some detail.\nOn September 8, 1900, in the course of the afternoon\nK. felt an impulse to write, and taking some sheets of\npaper drew on successive sheets five rough drawings. The\nfirst was of an arm and hand holding what might be a\ntoy pistol which was being fired off. The next, three\nfigures walking together and the end of the pistol pointing\nto one of them. Next a figure of a woman just falling\nover, bleeding in the head ; below a policeman blowing\nhis whistle, and a stretcher. Next a man's figure hiding\nsomething in his pocket. Then a female figure with a\nman beyond her with his arm round her, and another\nman shaking his fists at them. Then writing. \" Sarah.\nJack killed Sarah. Sarah. Sarah Willet. Jack Parr.\nAugust 2 days ago.\"\nIn the evening a sitting was held and Sarah Willet\ncommunicated the following.\n(K.) She says it was her fault not his, you mustn't\nlet him be killed for it. If he is, she shall never forgive\nherself, never rise, never move. . He makes her come to\nhim, he caUs her all day long.

Two people\nhave been to me, they tried to get me away. I went\nwith one, a good man. The other was a woman, she had\nsuffered too, she was very good to me. I think if I can\nget to where she is I shan't remember so much.\n(Dark sitting, Sept. 30, 1900. Sarah Willet speaking.) I\nJack ! Jack ! Jack ! He's calling me.

M.)\n\" Do not let my death be avenged.\"\nAbout 9 p.m. the same evening as K. was walking down-\nstairs she felt two strong hands seize her by the shoulders\nand shake her violently. On asking Herbert about it he\nwrote, \" It is poor Sarah gone mad. He (John Parr) is\nafter her. He has come over.\nLater in the evening at a dark sitting K. said she saw\nSarah Willet, also a figure with a black thing like a\nsack tied over his head and shoulders. He came close\nto one of the circle, and seemed to envelop him, thus\ngiving the feeling of being strangled. (By raps) \" John\nParr hanged to-day.\"\nNot much attention was paid to the earlier of these\ncommunications which were interspersed with others of a\nsimilar nature, but on September 14, 1900, to our surprise\nwe read of the trial at the Old Bailey of John Parr, aged\n\f106] Presidential Address. 27\n\u20acighteen, French Polisher, charged with the murder of\nSarah Willet the younger, on August 27.\nI have recently ascertained that reports of the murder\nand inquest had appeared in the Morning Post of August\n29 and September 1, but these had not been seen by\nany member of the circle. Otherwise the names would\nhave been recognized.\nHere is the extract from The Times, September 14, 1900,\nJohn Park, 19, French Polisher, was indicted for and charged\non the Coroner's inquisition with the wilful murder of Sarah\nWiLLETT the younger.\nMr. Horace Avory, Mr. R. D. Muir and Mr. Guy Stephenson\nconducted the prosecution ; Mr. Biron, at the request of\nIVIr. Justice Bucknill, defended.\nThe prisoner had been keeping company with the deceased,\nwho was 19 years of age. Some weeks before August 27th\n\u2014the day on which the prisoner killed her\u2014the woman had\nbroken off the engagement. It was stated on the part of\nthe prosecution that on August 25 the prisoner was drinking\nin a public-house with three yoimg women, and in the course\nof conversation with them alluded to his quarrel with Willett,\nand said he intended to do for her and himseK too, adding,\n\" Instead of hearing of a marriage you wUl hear of a burial.\"\nHe produced a revolver and fired it into the street to show\nthat it was loaded, and gave cartridges to two of the young\nwomen as a present. On August 27 the deceased and a girl\nfriend were in the Foresters' Music-hall in the East-end of\nLondon. The prisoner came to the Music-hall and asked\nWillett to treat him to some drink, but she refused, whereupon\nhe took up her glass of stout and drank it. The girl and\nher friend left the Music-hall. The prisoner followed them.\nWhen opposite the police-station in the Bethnal Green Road,\nWiUett said to him, \" What do you intend to do ? \" The\nprisoner made a reply to the effect that he intended that\nshe should continue to keep company with him. The deceased\nsaid,\n'\"'\nI don't want you. All I want is an honest, hard-\nworking fellow\u2014not one who robs others.\" The prisoner\nthereupon drew a revolver and fired a shot at Willett. The\nbullet entered her temple. She screamed and fell. A police-\nofficer rushed out of the police-station and found the prisoner\n\f28 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [part\nwith the revolver in his hand. The prisoner exclaimed, \" I\nhave done it. I have done it.\" He was searched, and on\nhim was found a piece of paper on which was written, \"It is\nall her own fault, and she deserves it. Goodbye pals, one\nand all.\" The injured woman died the same evening.\nDr. Scott, Medical Officer of HoUoway, said that while the\nprisoner had been in HoUoway upon the charge he had been\nkept under close observation to ascertain the condition of his\nmind. He thought that the prisoner's intellect was of a\nsomewhat low order. The prisoner was vain and bombastic.\nHe was informed that there was a case of alleged insanity\non each side of the prisoner's family, and he was told that\nthe prisoner had had a severe fall at a gymnasium some years\nago. He had seen nothing about the prisoner which, in his\nopinion, indicated insanity.\nEvidence was given for the defence. It was stated that the\nprisoner had seemed strange in his maimer for some time\nbefore August 28. He spoke of going to Australia. There\nwas insanity in his family. Some years ago he had had a\nsevere fall on his head at a gymnasium. He had complained\nof pains in his head.\nMr. Biron submitted that there was no motive for the\nprisoner to murder the deceased. The revolver was little\nmore than a toy. There was no evidence that the prisoner\ntook out the revolver and aimed it at Willett. The first\nthing that was seen was the flash of the revolver going off.\nIt might very well be that it went off by accident. The\nprisoner's mind at the time was distraught and unhinged.\nThe jury retired to consider their verdict, and after an\nabsence of nearly three-quarters of an hour they returned into\nCourt finding the prisoner CtUILTY, but strongly recommending\nhim to mercy on the ground of his youth.\nMr. Justice Bucknill said that the recommendation to\nmercy would be at once forwarded to the proper quarter. He\nsentenced the prisoner to death.\nMorning Post. Oct. 3, 1900.\n'\nExecution at Newgate\u2014John Parr, 19, French Polisher,\nwho was sentenced to death at the Central Criminal Court for\nthe murder of Sarah Willett, aged nineteen, by shooting her\n\f106] Presidential Address. 29\nwith a revolver in Bethnal-green, was hanged within Newgate\nGaol yesterday morning. Death was instantaneous.\nJohn Parr made his first appearance at the evening\nsitting on October 2, the day of his execution. He was\nin a great rage, calling for Sarah. He had been told he\nwould find Sarah here. E. M. explained that he would\nnot be allowed to see Sarah until he had forgiven her ;\nthat they were now both dead, so that it was no use\nkeeping up enmity.\nHe came again on October 3 and 4, and gradually came\nto see reason. On October 22, he announced that he\nhad forgiven Sarah and had met her, but did not intend\nto have anything more to do with her. After that he\nwas constantly popping in to say a few words.\nUnfortunately the MS. book with the verbatim reports\nof these sittings is missing, and we have only the summary.\nBut on October 28 he came and said, in reference to a\ncabinet which he had noticed as needing a polish :\nI have come to tell you how I am getting on, and to\nthank you for helping me ; and I will give you the polish\nwhat was given me, I was not to tell anybody. Beeswax,\nhoney, vinegar, whiting, and linseed oil. Mix linseed\nand vinegar and honey together, dab linseed and vinegar\nwith a very little honey and do not forget the whiting.\nSprinkle a very little in with the other, then get your\nbeeswax, and leave it to soak in ; and when it is soft\ndrain off all that will run and keep the thick. Get a\npiece of wadding and tie it up tight in a piece of soft\nmuslin. Put it in the polish. Work with the grain of\nthe wood, and never stop till you have rubbed every\ndrop in. Then take a piece of clean flaimel, dip it in\nlinseed oil and rub in with the grain, this time round and\nround ; then polish with a wash-leather pad.\nThis was done, and next time John Parr came, he\nexpressed himself very well satisfied with the result.\nBut, you will say, and rightly, why go so fully into\nthis case 1 Is there anything special about it ?\nNow the latest serious study of our literature is by\nDr. Broad, the eminent Cambridge logician and philo-\n\f30 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [part\nsopher, in his book The Mind and its Place in Nature\npublished in 1925. Dr. Broad has read our Hterature\nand has attended some sittings, and his conclusion is\nthat the known facts support the theory of \" the persis-\ntence of some factor which was a constituent of a human\nmind,\" but not the survival of that mind integrally.\nHis words are, page 539 :\nWe are not justified in saying that the mind of John\nJones has survived tlie death of his body imless we\nhave reason to believe that there is still a continuous\nstream of mental states which may be said to be \" Further\nexperiences of John Jones.\" We must suppose that\nthis contains conations as well as cognitions, that it puts\nends before itself and tries to realise them, and that it\nfeels elation, or disappointment, according to its success\nor failure in doing so.\nNow strangely enough it is this case of Sarah Willett\nand John Parr which seems to contain the very elements\nwhich Dr. Broad misses in his alleged communications\nfrom the dead. Sarah was terrified at the thought of\nJohn's revenge. John arrived in hot haste after hanging,\nin search of revenge, had to be made to see that revenge\nwas useless, and finally forgave Sarah and became a\nreasonable being with a future of progress before him.\nHere we have conations, attempts to realise ends, and\ndisappointment, and in a mild form, almost elation.\nI conclude then that survival fits the facts and that\nmore than \" temporary mindkins \" (Dr. Broad's phrase)\nmay be revealed through trance mediumship.\nAnother communication that has been verified is that\nof John Mitchell who controlled on December 22, 1900,\nwhen Myers was present. My note is :\nJohn Mitchell looking for Richard Goss, both drowned\ntogether at Devonport three weeks ago.\nThen on February 11, 1901, K. was crystal gazing and\nsaw two men rowing hard in a boat in a rough sea, with\nland on either side ; then the boat capsized and the taller\nof the two men, with a black beard, was drowned. Then\ncame letters of the alphabet, each word spelt backwards...\n\f106] Presidential Address. 31\n\"Dick Goss, Saltmarsh, Plymouth. He was di-owned and\nhis body was not found ; he has been before to you\nwhen your friend Myers was here. He wants help very\nmuch. He wants his body found, it lies off Plymouth\nSound.\" No mention of this accident appeared in the\nLondon Standard, the only newspaper that was taken at\nLe Chalet at that time. Later on I wrote to the Editor\nof the Western Morning News and obtained from him a\nshort notice of the inquest on the body of John Mitchell\nwho had been drowned about December 10, 1900. He\nwas a Plymouth longshore man. The body of his com-\npanion Richard Goss had not been recovered. I gave\nthis cutting with a copy of the communications to Miss\nJohnson in case she could find room for it in the Journal,\nbut on enquiry at the office I find that it has disappeared,\nprobably during the move from Hanover Square.\nOn July 8, 1900, at Wimbledon the following message\nwas rapped out from Herbert. '\u2022\nThere is a man here\nwho wishes me to tell you his name is Arthur Trefusis\nJones.\" I vaguely remembered a cousin of that name\nwho had died many years before. I said, \" Are you a\nson of Sir Harry 1\n\" \" Yes,\" was rapped out. Then\n\" Will you ask for help for Kumasi ?\n\" After this I wi'ote\nto my mother if she could tell me anything. She replied,\n\" You ask if I can tell you anything of Sir Harry's son\nArthur, poor feUow. He and I were just like brother and\nsister all the time Sir Harry was at Chatham. He was\nintended for the Army Medical Service, but at the time\nof the Crimean War got a commission and then was\nsent out to the Gold Coast and died there in June or\nJuly 1861.\" Kumasi was invested by the Ashantis on\nApril 25, 1900. The garrison was reheved on July 15,\nonly just in time to prevent their being starved into\nsurrender.\nOn a later occasion I asked Herbert how this cousin\nhad found me out. His reply was, \" In the first place\ntime has nothing to do with it and, secondly, association\nof relationship makes a link from one to the other\n\u2014\nthough it makes no difference as to being with each\nother. Yom- Guides have met his Guide and there is a\n\f32 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [part\nchain that way. Knowing that there was a possibility\nof communicating he came ;\nthough it is quite certain\nhe would not have come so easily to any other circle.\nAnd again your Guide knows your father's Guide. He\nwould know the Guides of other members of his family ;\nand so links are easily formed with what seem to you\npast generations.\nOn May 1, 1901, Victor Baihff, a sailor on the Lorton\ncommunicated. He said that he had passed over eleven\nweeks ago stabbed by Giovanni. \" It was my fault not\nhis ; I forgive him.\" The Lorton was at Falmouth with\na cargo of nitrate. Again on May 5, the same com-\nmunicator, \" Do not let it be visited on him, I provoked\nhim, I think he is in prison at Truro.\" In the Daily\nMail for June 27, 1901, there was a paragraph headed\n\" On Behalf of a Murderer \" (from our special corre-\nspondent) Rome. Sunday. June 23rd.\nThe Italian Government has made representations to\nthe British Authorities with reference to Giovanni Valeiri,\nan Italian sailor who was condemned to death at Bodmin\nfor murder. It seems that Valeiri had been several\ntimes confined in a Lunatic Asylum, and has always been\nweak mentally.\nGiovanni Valeiri was sentenced to death at Bodmin\nAssizes on June 17 for \" the murder on the High Seas\nof Victor Bailiff a native of Jersey.\" The motive was\nsupposed to be one of revenge.\nIt would almost seem sometimes as if identification so\nmuch desired by us here is for some reason not liked\nby those on the other side. I had a striking example\nof this when, in the year 1902, passing through Paris,\nI made the acquaintance of Monsieur Fernand Desmoulin,\na well-known French portrait painter, who had recently\ndeveloped automatic drawing. He had been told by\nautomatic writing to buy a box of pastels and suitable\ncanvasses, and when I visited him his studio was filled\nwith weird landscapes, drawn with great vigour, but\nutterly unlike any earthly scene. He had also drawn\nhuman figures in mediaeval costumes and head-dresses.\n\f106] Presidential Address. 33\nHe was ordered to avert his eyes until the drawing\nwas completed ; if he looked his hand stopped and wrote\n\" tu regarde \" on the paper beside the canvas. These\ndrawings were signed \" Ton vieux maitre \" or \" Stromboli.\"\nOn one occasion Stromboli had drawn a series of profiles\non one canvas, one within the other, and being in a\ncommunicative mood had stated that they were portraits\nof his family. He had on different occasions given a\nlittle information about himself\u2014that he had been an\nEnglishman ; that he had been dead so many years, and\nsome other facts about his life which should make\nidentification fairly easy. As I was returning to England\nDesmoulin asked me to try and find out if there had been\nan English artist whom the facts fitted.\nOn arriving in London I called on the editor of an\nillustrated paper, and in a short time ascertained that\nthere had been an English artist whose life exactly fitted\nthe statements of Stromboli. The editor very kindly\ngave me a copy of a back number of the paper containing\nthe portrait of this artist which had appeared at the\ntime of his death. I at once wrote to Desmoulin and\nsuggested that next time Stromboli controlled he should\nget him to draw his own portrait. I said I considered\nthat if it resembled the portrait in the newspaper it\nwould be highly interesting and somewhat evidential.\nI waited some weeks for a reply, and then heard that\nfrom the day my letter was received Stromboli had never\ncontrolled again. It would seem that for some reason\nor other he did not wish his identity to become known.\nIn the late autumn of 1900 after the death of Mrs.\nWingfield, K. and her two sisters came out to Valescure\nto stay with E. M. at her villa. We were in our own\nvilla not far off and a large number of trance sittings took\nplace, under what I venture to think were ideal con-\nditions. What are ideal conditions ? A small circle of\nintimate friends with one of themselves as medium, sitting\nregularly in a quiet spot under good climatic conditions.\nThe purpose of these sittings was, as before, a serious\none, either for instruction or for help to those who may\nbe brought to the circle.\n\f34 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [part\nWhat in the year 1900 was the presupposition of\ntrance sittings ? Myers' book was not yet published,\nthough part of it had appeared in Proceedings. But there\nwas no general knowledge of the unconscious, the sub-\nconscious or subliminal. The tripartite division of Man as\nbody, soul and spirit was the only one known. The soul\nleft the body during sleep or in trance.\nAs an illustration of this, on four different occasions,\nmy youngest girl, aged nine, purported to control during\nher sleep, speaking with great animation and very charac-\nteristically. In the first instance, she was at Ripley, some\nfifteen miles from Wimbledon where K. was staying.\nLater at Valescure she was asleep either in the same\nhouse or in the neighbouring villa.\nOn the first occasion the child was asked, after some\nconversation, \" What about the sailor frock ? \" The\nanswer came, \" We went to a shop. Mummie just said,\n'\nYou get those things out. That is her tallness.' And\nthey got them ;\nnothing else to be done, no altering.\nThey just sent them home. That's what I like.\" This\nwas a correct version of what had happened that after-\nnoon. The child had been taken by her mother to\nLondon but none of us had been at Wimbledon that day,\nso K. and the other members of the circle only knew\nthat there was a plan to buy a sailor frock.\nHere is Herbert's comment\n:\nIn many cases a spirit on our side is quite unable to\ntell if a person is dead, or vmconscious, or merely sleeping,\nif the spirit is outside ; for after death for some little\ntime the cord hangs loosely before it is absorbed into the\nsoul-body, and often in sleep the slackness of the cord\npresents the same appearance.\nThis may be compared with the \" Beard \" case in\nJournal XXIII, pp. 130-132, where Mr. Beard was described as\nhaving quite recently passed over at a sitting held some\neight hours before his actual decease.\nWe sat three and four days a week, generally for\nabout an hour and a half, without the shghtest effect on\nK.'s health. After her return to England in 1901 it was.\n\f106] Presidential Address. 35\ndecided by her family that it was undesirable that she\nshould become known as a trance medium, and the\nsittings became occasional only and were finally abandoned.\nIt may be of interest here to say something about the\ntrance. It was induced by a tap on the temple by E. M.\nand the order \"Go to sleep.\" A similar tap with the\norder \" Wake up,\" restored K. to consciousness. There\nwas no waking stage as in Mrs. Piper's trance. Complete\namnesia of what had happened either in the seance room\nor to herseK was the general rule.\nBut on two or three occasions she was told to remember\nwhom she met on the other side and what they had told\nher. Once when she had been working a cushion cover\nin silks and was puzzled as to what was the right stitch\nfor completing a tulip, she was asked to find out on the\nother side from a friend who had often communicated\nand who in life had done beautiful embroidery. On\nwaking up K. said that she had been to the \" garden\n\"\nand met Marguerite and had consulted her about the\ntulip. Marguerite had then \" made \" a tulip, also canvas\nand silks and needle, and had shown K. exactly what\nstitch to use. Certainly the tulip was successfully com-\npleted and the cushion cover long remained a valued\npossession.\nOther curious occasions were when K. seemed to stand\noutside her body and control it from outside just like\nany other control. At these times she always spoke of\nher body as a \"Me,\" and her soul as an \" I \" \"There\nis an '\nI '\nhere who hasn't got a '\nMe,' \" speaking of my\nboy who was waiting his turn to control.\nIt was during K.'s stay at Valescure that the cross\ncorrespondences with Mrs. Thompson took place described\nby Mr. Piddington in Proceedings, Vol. XVIII. , pp. 205,\n267, 294. As the previous pseudonym \" Miss A.\" had\nbeen used by others, I was asked to suggest a second,\nand decided on \" Miss Rawson.\" Further mention by\nSir Oliver Lodge occurs in Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.,\npp. 212, 219. Also in Journal, Vol. XL, p. 167.\nIn addition to raps and table tilting we occasionally\ngot what is now called telekinesis, movements of objects\n\f36 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [part\nwithout contact. Here is my note of a sitting at Le\nChalet, Valescure (E. M.'s villa), on January 29, 1901.\nAs soon as K. was entranced she got up and moved\nacross the room in the dark in search of a small round\nheavy table, which she placed in front of the sofa on which\nshe sat. It was then forcibly raised in the air until\nalmost out of reach. E. M. seized the leg and brought\nit down to the floor again.\nThe room was not pitch dark, there was a fairy lamp\nout of direct sight, and the remains of a fire on the\nhearth. The table was plainly visible in the air. Herbert\nthen spoke and said that this physical manifestation was\nin answer to what E. J. (my wife) had been mentally\nasking for. Then a second time K. went in search of\nthe table which had been moved away and, having got\nit, collected my hand and E. J.'s and put them with\nher own and E. M.'s on the top of the table. It was\nthen forcibly lifted ujd from underneath and when about\nthree feet from the ground fell with a crash that broke\npart of the ornamental carving. Then Herbert spoke\nto E. J.\nYou wanted this not as a test but as it were an\nillustration to a book, to help you to realize physical\nphenomena. I had to have some particular spirits who\ncame, who were material, to do it. To get active power\nyou must get spirits on the earth plane, not bad ones,\nto help. I asked for someone to give you that demon-\nstration. Materialized hands were pushing the table\nup, most of the power to do this came from K. and\nE. M. (E. M. became very hot during the levitation.)\nI did not tell any of you beforehand that I intended to\ndo this, so that it was not only a manifestation of spirit\nforce but of the power of spirits' knowledge of your\nown mind.\nThen comes a note in my wife's handwriting.\nThe last sentence was in answer to a mental wish I\nhad formed during that afternoon while reading, that I\nmight one day witness some striking physical phenomena.\nI had not confided my wish to anyone.\n\f106] Presidential Address. 37\nAgain on March 28, at a house in London.\nWe sat round a small table. K. not in trance. The\ntable was violently shaken and finally lifted into the\nair twice and then let down with a crash. The small\narmchair on which K. was sitting was moved under her,\nand after she had got up and no one was touching it,\nwas again slowly moved round and away. Then a screen\nwas slightly moved without contact with any sitter.\nAfterwards K. went into trance and Herbert said he had\ngot help from some Elementals (or forces) to produce\nthese movements. They had tried to get passage of\nmatter through matter, but there was not enough force\nin the circle. We were all tired after a long day in\nLondon.\nHere are the Notes on Apports. Ned Carter was a\nlittle Cockney boy who often came to the circle.\nSeptember 2oth. Herbert rapped : \"I have told Ned\nto try and bring you something to-night. K. was then\nentranced, and said, \" They are trying so hard to bring\nsomething from the next room \"\n\u2014presently she said,\n\" They've done it,\" and after a little Ned Carter came\nand spoke. \" I've brought you a flower\u2014a red one\n\u2014\naren't you going to take it ? (Where is it ?) In that\n'ere red thing. I brought it out of the next room,\nthrough the wall.\" (After the sitting we found a red\nsweet-pea had been put in the little tray on the table\nwe were sitting round but not touching, broken off rather\nshort. Herbert told us when he came, that it was out\nof one of the vases on the dining-room table, so we\nlooked and found the other half of the stalk in one of\nthe vases, exactly fitting the one which had been brought\nby Ned. We had been sitting in the drawing-room with\nall the doors and windows locked, and there were no\nsweet peas in the house except the four vases in the\ndining-room\u2014which was also locked up for the night.)\nOn October 17, 1900, at Wimbledon, K. was entranced\nrather suddenly and seemed to be going through some\nvery great exertion, panting and groaning and pushing\nher hands together, then holding them above her head.\n\f38 Sir- Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [PABT\nand then putting them on the table. She kept saying,\n\"\nThree, three,\" but we could not make out what it\nreferred to. At last she said, \" He has gone\u2014the Indian.\nThere is something on the table\u2014you must not lose it.\"\nWe felt about and found three very small hard objects\nlike beads and, on examining them afterwards with a\nlight, we found they were three tiny unset turquoises.\nIt had taken a great deal of power out of both K. and\nE. M. and when Herbert came to speak later he could\nhardly produce any voice at all, the power was so weak.\nWith so much writing we naturally enquired as to the\nmethods used. Here is a reply.\nThere are two ways we influence the writing control ;\none through the hand automatically, the other by moving\nthe brain and impressing the words we want to put on\npaper.\n1. Automatic. When we write automatically, or without\ninfluencing the medium, we get into the aura of the\nperson we are writing through, and direct a strong magnetic\ncurrent on the hand and pencil which we control from a\npoint not very far away.\nWhen this is the case the hand moves in answer to\nthe direction from the other side : we do not actually\nmove it with our hands, but we speak and the words\nare taken through this aura and guide the hand to write.\nIt is difficult to explain and sounds impossible, but\nit is because your laws do not control on our side that\nwe are able to do it.\n2. The Brain. The other way is when we influence the\nbrain. We generally do that first, before we get entire\ncontrol of the hand ; for the first thing is to get the\nbrain entirely under control\u2014and you see we want it\nequally under control when we write through the hand\nonly, but in another way.\nThen we have to keep the brain perfectly quiet, to\ntake away all power of control from mind to hand, to\nleave the muscles and hand perfectly free and imcontrolled.\nBut when we influence the brain, we do it word by word,\nnot sentence by sentence ; there is no connection between\n\f106] Presidential Address. 39\nthe beginning and end of a paragraph in the mediums\nmind : he simply hears a few words and puts them down,\nand the words we put into the brain by speaking them\nspiritually into the inner consciousness.\nSo you see you need not think it is yourself because\nyou know the words.\nHere is an explanation of \" raps.\"\nWhen you make a circle for the purpose of communi-\ncating with those on the other side, you generally join\nhands and that makes a circle both in the atmospheric\nconditions and also in the material magnetism ; and inside\nthat circle you are able to bring a kind of rarefied atmo-\nsphere that enables spirits to come close. You cannot\nget these conditions without making a circle for it. When\nyou have done this and waited a little, then gradually\nyou find that the raps come\u2014and the raps, you must\nremember, are not the actual hands of the spirits them-\nselves, but the force that you are storing, utUized by them\nto make sound with ; and as you are storing it in the\ntable, it is in the table the raps are heard. It is the\nvery greatest pleasure to those on the other side to come\nwhen you are sitting, for it makes a kind of bond of\nintelligence between the two worlds, and makes it easy\nfor them to speak to you.\nMany of those who meet a violent death do not realize\nthat space is aimihilated for them as it is for all spirits ;\nthey think that they are obliged to stay where they aro ar.d\nthat they cannot get out of the place where their spirits\nleft the body.\nAnd then they see a light, and that light is because\nyou are sitting in a circle and are willing to help and\nthey find they can walk towards the light, which attracts\nthem as a candle attracts a moth, and they come and\nfind you can hear them speak, and they feel that you\nare in the flesh and they tell you their story and ask\nyou to help them to get away, and then you pray for\nthem. And they can meet us too when they are with\nyou and so gradually they get to understand where they\nare and to know that they can advance and rise and\n\f40 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Barf. [part\nget beyond the material. When you have begun the\nwork by teaching them this, we can carry it on until\nwe have got them quite clear of their bodies. ,\nI\nI must now come to the teachings received by K., and\nlisre I am tempted to quote from Professor Richet, Thirty\nYears of Psychical Research, page 80. He says :\nThe characteristics of the literature of the unconscious-\nare distinctive enough to be recognised without difficulty.\nThere is in the first place a marked tendency to vague\nand mystical phrases on the destiny of the Soul and its\nimperishable powers. These divagations of the sub-\nconscious are always markedly religious, as if their purpose\nwas to lay down the rites and doctrines of a new religion.\nThey are pervaded by a love for humanity which would .\n,\nbe touching if it were not expressed as a rhetorical and i\ncloudy philanthropy. Automatic writings abhor precision,,\nand shun precise indications, favouring very ordinary\ncommonplaces. ;\nThey would seem to be the work of poets ignorant of\nl^rosody, of philosophers who know no philosophy, of ,\npriests ignorant of theology ; all of whom make laudable\nefforts to give us counsel on philosophy and precepts on\nreligion in poetic and nebulous language.\nProfessor Richet is obviously writing from a study of\nsuch communications in the French language, and it is\ncurious that in the two countries a similar level seema\nto have been reached. I may note here that one com-\nmunicator who gave the name of Joh7i the Forerunner may\npossibly be identified with Jean le Precurseur, whose\nmessage is printed in a volume called La Survie, edited\nby Madame Rufina Noeggerath, published in Paris, 1897.\nEnglish automatic messages also reach what I may call\na high level of mediocrity which is very rarely overpassed.\nI venture to think that some of the best are in the two-\nlittle books, Guidance from Beyond and More Guidaiice^\nfro7n Beyo7id, given through K. Wingfield, published ia\n1923 and 1925 by Philip Allan.\nProfessor Richet's conclusion that these messages come\nfrom the subconsciousness of the medium involves an\n\f106] Presidential Address. 41\nassumption that all writing mediums are alike, as regards\ntheir subconscious faculties.\nGranting the possibility of communication, it is easier\nto believe that, varied as mediums are in their intellectual\nand moral level, they come in contact with a plane on\nwhich are many intelligences of mediocre attainment,\neager to communicate what they have learnt, and too\nready to ofier partial solutions of problems which are as\nmuch beyond their ken as beyond ours.\nIt is the communicator who honestly says, \" I don't\nknow,\" in reply to some question of free will, or high\ntheology, whom one would respect and wish to hear\nmore from.\nIn regard to my own experience : having been present\nwhen a good number of these messages were received, and\nnoting the varied handwritings which were characteristic\nof the communicators, it is impossible to me to believe\nthat these are all traceable to the unconscious mind of a single\nmedium.\nAt the same time the high claims made by the com-\nmunicators themselves, as to the lofty origin of their\nteachings, make us anxious to form some theory of their\nprovenance.\nCan the explanation be that these messages come from\nintelhgences who have not lived on earth, who know oar\njoys and sorrows by hearsay only, and are too ready to\noffer consolation in general terms.\nThe toad beneath the harrow knows\nExactly where each sharp prong goes ;\nThe butterfly upon the road.\nPreaches contentment to the toad.\nThere would seem to be many butterflies hovering round\nthe automatist.\nOne thing is certain. There is no revelation in the\nsense of something unthought of or beyond the grasp of\nhuman imagination.\nOn the contrary, no messages have attained the spiritual\nvision of a St. rran9ois de Sales, or the profundity of\nour great philosophers and poets, just as in science, where\n\f42 Sir Laivrence J. Jones, Bart. [part\nverification is possible, there has been no revelation\nreaching beyond the discoveries of the day.\nThere have been many descriptions of life on Mars.\nWe ourselves had an example of them, written, I must\nallow, contribution to a domestic magazine. But\nuntil the telescope revealed the two small satellites and\nastronomers calculated their orbits and revolutions, the\nonly hint of their existence was made by Dean Swift in\nGulliver's Travels. No description of Martian landscape\nmentioned these striking objects hurrying across the sky.\nThe same is true of Jupiter's moons ; automatists only\nknow of the number already discovered at the date of\nwriting.\nIn addition to the general \" Guides \" we each had our\nown personal Guide, whose names were given. Mine was\n\" Dominie,\" a quite appropriate name, as I was then\nteaching my own children. My wife's was \" Rayda \" and\neach child had one or more Guides ; who were, we were\ntold, liable to be changed as life went on.\nI cannot say that Dominie's guidance, as expressed in\nhis words and messages, amounted to more than vague\npredictions of good news to come and encouragement to\ncontinue my investigations.\nThe statement made by Herbert in writing, ''\nthat there\nis no human being born into the world without a guide\nbeing appointed to look after that soul,\" seems quite\nincredible. When one thinks of 1,500 million people,\nincluding such varying types as a Chinese coolie, an\nAndaman islander, a Tennessee Fundamentalist and a\nBolshevist executioner ; the idea of each having a Guide\nimmobilized beside him, without the slightest power of\ninfluencing his reason or his pity, seems a waste of force\nhardly to be expected even in an illimitable universe.\nWhen Stead was preparing a second series of his letters\nfrom Julia, he wrote to me and asked if there were any\nsubjects on which I wanted information. I replied\n\" Guides.\" But when the book came out there was\nnothing about Guides.\nSo I have no confirmation of the real existence of\nDominie and Rayda. And yet at one time we were\n\f106] Presidential Address. 43\nspoken of as \" Dominie's and Rayda's man and woman \" ;\nimplying that they were, if anything, more real than\nwe were. I believe the conditions to be infinitely more\ncomplex than we have any idea of, and that, what with\nthought forms, dream forms, elementals et hoc genus omne,\nthe Control is not always able to distinguish between what\nis there and what we are asking for ;\nand, in the case\nof a double personality we should not ourselves know\nwhat we are asking for.\nIn December, 1900, Myers came to Valescure on his way\nto Rome and had some sittings with us. Edmund Gurney\nand Henry Sidgwick and others who had come through\nMrs. Thompson communicated, and Myers was greatly\ncheered by the corroboration he received of messages\nalready given through Mrs. Thompson.\nMyers was already seriously ill with an advanced form\nof heart disease. And here I should like to interpolate\na warning against taking too seriously the predictions of\nmediums. I well remember on this occasion going for a\nwalk with Myers and the turn of the road at which he\nstopped and said to me : \"I have four hundred and\nfourteen days to live.\" I gazed at him in astonishment.\n\" Yes,\" he said, \" my death has been definitely predicted\nto me for a day in February 1902. I have made all my\narrangements on this basis. I have divided up the\n^ork that still remains to do on my book into twelve\nparts, and I am going to do one part each month. I\nshall then finish the book and have a few weeks before\nmy time comes.\"\na fact, Myers died at Rome on January 17, 1901^\nwithin a month of our conversation. His book, Human\nPersonality and its Survival of Bodily Death, was not\nfinished. The Epilogue, with its splendid eloquence,\nhangs as it were in the air, with but few corroborative\nfacts to support it. The reason for this is that Myers\nhad intended to print in Proceedings a full report of his\nsittings with Mrs. Thompson, together with a comment on\nHodgson's unfavourable report on the same medium. An\nepitome of this would no doubt have appeared in the\nbook. But his premature death prevented this, and his\n\f44 Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart. [part\nliterary executors Richard Hodgson and Miss Alice Johnson\nhad to print the unfinished book with the lamentable\nomission of most of the evidence on which Myers had\nbased his enthusiastic belief in Survival.\nStrangely enough Hodgson himself seems also to have\nbeen misled by some general predictions received through\nMrs. Piper, which have been printed by Mrs. Sidgwick in\nVol. XVIII. of Proceedings. The records show that a\ncontinued and prosperous life was prophesied for Hodgson\nhimself. Part 2 of his Paper on Mrs. Piper never saw\nthe light, and it is probable that the prophecies had\nencouraged him to postpone writing until he had the\nwhole of the evidence before him. As you will remember,\nhe died suddenly in 1905. So in two important instances\nthe literature of Psychical Research has suffered through\nundue reliance on prophecy.\nAnother false prophecy, happily not misleading, has\nbeen handed to me by Mrs. Sidgwick.\nOn March 11, 1894, at Boston, Mass., Richard Hodgson\nnotes that \" the statement was made to me in so called\nautomatic writing by Mrs. Viper during trance, that\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick of Cambridge, England, would\ndie soon of heart faihire.\" \" Soon \" was interpreted as\nmeaning \" months.\" Professor Sidgwick lived for six years\nlonger, and did not die of \" heart failure.\"\nA few words on predictions in general may be allowed\nhere. It is not infrequent that a sensitive gives remark-\nably accurate delineations of a sitter's past and present\nsurroundings.\nIf she goes on to predict the future, the sitter is apt\nto give too much heed, forgetting that he himself is the\nsource whence all the information has been obtained. His\nfuture may be visible, but too often it is his unexpressed\nor even subconscious hopes and fears which colour the\nprediction.\nIf a second sensitive is consulted and the same pre-\ndiction made, the sitter is more and more impressed. But\nin reality there is but little true corroboration ; the sitter\nbrings with him his recollection of the first prediction\nand this naturally colours the second. So that those\n\f106] Presidential Address. 45\nwho expect such things as an inheritance or marriage\nor the birth of a child on the ground that two or more\nsensitives have concurred in their predictions, are building\non the sand.\nReaders of Osty's Supernormal Faculties in Man will\nremember his lucid analysis of \" fabulations \" and their\norigin in the latent mental content of the sitter.\nSoon after Myers' death we had various messages from\nhim. They contained nothing evidential. Then came\ncommunicators with high sounding names, such as Ben-\njamin DisraeK, who criticized the then Conservative leaders\nmuch in the style of a retired colonel at the Carlton Club.\nThen various Biblical characters with a plentiful supply\nof texts and nothing to say of any importance. Then\nEdward Maitland, the mystic, and biographer of Anna\nKingsford. He had been a friend of the Wingfield\nfamily and in his old age used to visit them when his\nhands were doubled up with arthritis. At his first\nappearance in the circle, K. rose up, doubled up her\nfist and solemnly shook hands all round. My wife and\nI were introduced and formally shook hands. I mention\nthis because some years later at my only sitting with\nMrs. Thompson, at Lady Battersea's house, while we three\nwere sitting chatting before the fire, Mrs. Thompson\nsuddenly went into trance, turned to me and in her usual\nvoice said :\n\" You know Edward.\" I had known various\nEdwards, so replied \" Yes,'' rather doubtfully : on this\nMrs. Thompson doubled up her fist and presented it to\nme to shake in precisely the same mamier as K. had\ndone some years before. I called out \" Edward Maitland !\n\"\nBut he had nothing to say of any interest.\nAnd lastly I come to communications from our own\nboy. From the first we got messages about him. and\nlater from him. Gradually he learnt how to communicate\nthrough K. entranced, and at last there was hardly a\nsitting in which he did not say a few words.\nLooking over my notes I find but little of general\ninterest or in any way evidential. He is interested in\nour daily life, and in the doings of his brother, especially\non the river at Eton. But on February 19, 1901, I\n\f46 Sit' Lawrence J. Jones, Barf. [part\nsuddenly thought of a question. \" Can you explain what\nyou said in your last illness ?\n\" The last few days of\nhis life he was delirious and talked much to himself. But\nonce when I was sitting by him, he suddenly sat up in\nbed and said, in a loud voice and with much emphasis :\n\" The truth shall be established in thee.\" An unlikely\nsaying for a boy of fourteen. I had not the least idea\nof what it could mean but had always remembered it.\nOn this occasion I asked him if he could explain it\nand he replied : \"I heard this said to me.\" \" Yes ?\n\" I\nsaid, and he went on, \" Well Dada, and so it has been ;\nfor I have been the link to teach you the Truth. I was\nready to go then though I didn't know it, and it was\nbest for you that I should go. My going has brought\ntruth close.\"\nThe more I reflect on this prophecy uttered through\nthe lips of a boy\u2014his pure and noble soul hovering on\nthe brink of departure\u2014and so strangely fulfilled within\nthree years through the lips of another, the thinner grows\nthe barrier between \" here \" and \" there,\" and the more\nI am filled with wonder and thankfulness.\nIt might be thought that, after my long series of\nsittings with K., I should continue my investigations with\nother mediums. I did not do so except to a very slight\nextent. My reason was that I felt like the housekeeper\nin a great house which was to be let for the first time\nto some nouveaux-riches . The housekeejDcr was asked by\na friend of mine whether she intended to stay on under\nthe new conditions. Her reply was :\n\" No indeed ! It is\nnot likely that anyone as 'as spent 'er 'ole life with the\nHupper Ten would condescend to the Lower Five !\n\"\nI am afraid I felt that certainly most professional\nmediums might be classed as the Lower Five. I did, as\na fact, visit some haK dozen of the mediums who ad-\nvertized in Light to see whether they could show any\npowers of reading my hand, or seeing anything about me\nin the crystal. But I have learnt how to draw myself\ninto myself, and, further, not to give any indication\nduring the sitting as to whether their guesses were right\n\f106] Presidential Address. 47\nor wrong. The sittings were uniformly negative and\nmore pitiable specimens of fishing and floundering it is\nhard to imagine. I have had the same experience with\namateurs, and it would really seem as though I were\nrefractory to psychic penetration. Be that as it may,\nmy conclusion is distinctly against professional mediumship\nas a means of obtaining genuine communications from\nthe Other Side.\nInvestigations such as those carried on through Mrs.\nLeonard and other mediums with whom our Society is\nin touch, are in a different category, and I do not include\nthem in my criticism.\nSince these days we have had Mrs. Sidgwick's exhaustive\nand, if I may say so, devastating enquiry into the inde-\npendent existence of the Piper Controls.\nVolume XXVIII. of Proceedings containing her paper\non the Psychology of Mrs. Piper's Trance Phenomena,\nshould be studied by all who are minded to investigate\ntrance mediumship. This should be followed by Mr.\nSoal's paper in Proceedings, Vol. XXXV., on Cotnmunica-\ntions through Mrs. Blanche Cooper, where, among other\nstrange happenings, a fictitious communicator invented by\nthe sitter appears to have an independent life of his own.\nAdd to this, the very real risk of \"personation.\"\nespecially where repeated sittings take place. The original\ncommunicator who may well have been genuine can, it\nwould seem, be replaced by some intelligence who has\noverheard the names and amuses himself by repeating\nthem. Hence the common complaint that nothing fresh\ncomes through, only the same names and a vague word\nor two being obtained.\nWhen once assurance of Survival has been obtained, and\nthis may come in various ways, I would deprecate resort\nto mediums.\nIt is better to face life, fortified by the happy assurance\nthat death is no final parting, than to try to repeat what\nmay have been intended to be given once for all.\nMay I conclude with a personal avowal. I cannot\npretend that to live so constantly and continuously in\ncommunication with the Other Side, as I did for several\n\f48 Sir Lawrence J. Jones. Bart. [part\nmonths, does not involve severe strain ; I think it pro-\nduces a sort of glamour, the viewing of all things that\nhere befall in their sujiposed spiritual as well as in their\nearthly significance.\nWhile the glamour lasts there is grave risk of unwisdom\nin earthly affairs, of a loss of the critical faculty, of a\ntoo ready confidence in other men, especially if they too\nspeak the same language and testify to the same\nexperiences.\nStill, looking back over a quarter of a century, I am\ndeeply grateful for the assurance of survival and the\nhopeful interpretation of the Universe which goes with it.\nThis has ujDheld me through many bereavements, and\nenlarged my sympathy with struggling humanity.\nThere are many roads to faith in a spiritual Universe ;\nthis one is reprobated by many who have not experimented\nwith it, and, I must add, by some who have. One thing\nis to me certain. It is better to pass on with no fixed\nideas as to what we shall find or with whom we shall\nconsort.\nFor the Universe is \" infinite in an infinite number of\nways \" and the wider and deeper our apprehension of\nit, the grander will be its reaction upon us. It will be\nthe little child within us, always with open eyes wondering\nat the pageant of life who will lead us at last into the\nKingdom of Heaven.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF thf:\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 107\nTHE MODUS OPERANDI OF TRANCE COMMUNICATION\nACCORDING TO DESCRIPTIONS RECEIVED\nTHROUGH MRS. OSBORNE LEONARD.\nBy C. DRAYTON THOMAS.\nEditorial Note.\u2014Most of our papers concerned with\n7nediumistic communications deal mainly with the question of\nthe sources of such of the impressions received by mediums\nand automatists as appear to be beyond their reach in the\n7iormal state. The modus operandi noiv under discussion\nhas no direct bearing on this question. Indirectly, however,\nit may throw inuch light on it, and, in any case it is ob-\nviously a line of enquiry which those interested in psychical\nresearch are bound to pursue.\nMr. Drayton Thomas's paper deals mainly tvith the rela-\ntions between the different intelligences or strata of conscious-\nness concerned : with their influence upon each other, hoiv\nthey appear to each other, and how they communicate with\neach other.''- It is hoped that this paper may be folloived Ijy\nIt may be useful briefly to remind the reader that in the case of\nMrs. Leonard and probably most mediums who have to do with many\ndifferent sitters, these consciousnesses are as a rule of four kinds. There\nis, first, the sitter, who is certainly more than a mere passive recipient\nof broadcasted messages, since in a good sitting these messages are\nspecially appropriate to him. Secondly, there is the medium's normal\nconsciousness, which is apparently in abeyance dm'ing the trance.\nThirdly, there is the control (exemplified by Feda in Mrs. Leonard's\ncase) who carries on communication with the sitter by means of the\nmedium's organism, and acts as intermediary between the communicator\nand the sitter. And, lastly, there are one or more communicators\nusually claiming to be deceased friends of the sitter. Communicators\nsometimes dispense with an intermediarj^ and act as controls themselves.\nB\n\f50 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\nco7itributions from, others who have had opportunities of\nstudying either Mrs. Leonard or other mediums, or loho may\nhave critical observations to make tending to elucidate the\nsubject.\nIt may be noted that a good deal bearing on the sub-\nject in the cases of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompsoii has\nalready bee7i said in our Proceedings. See especially Vol.\nXXVIII. on Mrs. Piper by Mrs. Henry Sidgivich and\nVol. XVIII. pp. 104 ff. on Mrs. Thompson by Mr. J. G.\nPiddington. Papers on the modus operandi in mediumistic\ntrance by {Una) Lady Troubridge have also appeared in\nProceedings, Vol. XXXII. pp. SUff. and Vol. XXXIV.\npp. 298 ff.\nAny contribution towards the understanding of trance\nmethods should be of interest, not only to those\nwho share my conclusion that we can by this\nmeans, when employing a highly developed sensitive,\nenter into communication with the discarnate, but also to\nthose who incline towards alternative views. For what-\never may be the origin of the messages, it may be con-\nfidently assumed that they are produced in conformity\nwith law, which is observable in their characteristic\nimperfections, and frequent failure to make plain that\nwhich they obscurely hint, as well as in their correct\nstatements about matters unknown to the sitter.\nThe following observations, based upon some years of\nstudy with Mrs. Osborne Leonard, are supported by\nquotations. In these we have an explanation, given by\nthe messages themselves, of their origin and method of\ntransmission.\nThe passages selected purport to originate with my\nfather and my sister Etta. In each case I have indicated\nthe alleged speaker. Some were given through Feda,\nMrs. Leonard's control, while others came when she seemed\nto have relinquished control in favour of my father or\nEtta.\nIt is not my present purpose to produce the evidence\nwhich, as I consider, justifies me in assuming the identity\nof the commimicators and the distinct individuality of\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 51\nFeda, but rather to show how these different mentahties\ncontribute to an interpretation of the processes which\nresult in the spoken message.\nEach speaker preserves intact throughout all the sittings\nhis or her characteristics of manner and phraseology.\nThis is not so clearly seen in my records, because they\nare not always strictly verbatim. I make no attempt,\nfor example, to reproduce Feda's peculiarities of speech.\nBut this preservation of individuality is a marked feature\nof the sittings, as also of the messages. There is no\nsuspicion of intermingling ; each of the three makes upon\nmy mind as distinct an impression as would any other\nperson of my acquaintance.\nAt the commencement of Mrs. Leonard's trance it seems\nas if her individuality changes into that of another person,\nnamely that of Feda the control. Feda talks to me about\nmy communicators who are said to be somewhere in front\nof the medium. Feda (as I must now term the medium)\nthen begins to tell me what they say, and from time to\ntime bends forward in the attitude of attentive listening.\nShe often seems puzzled as to the communicator's mean-\ning, and will question the invisible presence before com-\npleting a sentence. There have been times when a\nfragmentary message contained definite evidence that my\nfather was aware of facts which he failed to convey to\nFeda in consecutive and accurate form. On some of\nthese occasions I could easily guess what it was he wished\nto tell me, and it seemed clear that he knew more than\nhe could make Feda understand. When he persisted in\ntrying to explain, Feda made a long circumlocution ; and\nif, for sake of experiment, I put leading questions, they\nonly brought further proof that Feda could not under-\nstand something which was clear to my father and to me.\nFeda frequently gives a statement in fragments, with\nrepetitions and pauses, exactly as if transmitting some-\nthing imperfectly heard. When names are introduced there\nis usually a difficulty in pronouncing them aright, although\nthe initial letter is given with ease. When Feda first\nalluded to my father it was as follows, \" There is an\nelderly man with a beard \" ; then came a description,\n\f52 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\nand later in the sitting she added, \" The initial J comes\nwith hini.\" I naturally asked myself why this was not\nabbreviated into the simple statement that John D.\nThomas was present ? During the second sitting, while\nmy father's study was being described, one item was\ngiven as follows :\nNear the bureau, but above it, and easily seen when\nsitting at it, is the picture of a man, elderly, with fine\nface, a splendid character.\nThis coidd have been simply stated thus : A picture of\nWesley is above the door. Why this roundabout descrip-\ntion and avoidance of names ? On many occasions names\nhave been correctly given without the least observable\ndifficulty. Yet at other times Feda will write the name\nin the air, using the medium's finger to trace the letters.\nSometimes after ineffectual efforts to pronounce a name,\nthe first syllable is given, and Feda will then complain\nthat she cannot see the remaining letters, but that they\nlook to be, say, six in number. One forms the impres-\nsion that the giving of a name, or indeed of any specific\nword for which there is no alternative, involves the\novercoming of some obstacle.\nIt is a noteworthy fact that for a period, rarely more\nthan twenty minutes in any one sitting, Feda will speak\nas if she were receiving from dictation. I can often at\nthese times catch each softly whispered sentence before\nhearing it repeated in the clear Feda voice. This dicta-\ntion method always reaches a high degree of accuracy,\nand I realise that I am receiving, not merely the com-\nmunicator's thoughts, but also the chai-acteristic diction.\nWhen, however, Feda relapses into what appears to be\nher own phrasing of the message the precision and\naccuracy become markedly less.\nTurning to the messages themselves for explanation of\nthese features we find it stated that the communicators\nconvey their meaning to Feda in the form of thought,\nand that this thought of theirs may emerge in Feda's\nconsciousness either as hearing, as sight, or as an impres-\nsion. If this ])e so, it explains at once why the \" heard\n\"\n\flu7j The Modus OjJerandi of Trance Gomtnuitication. 53\nmessages are given with so much more crispness and\naccuracy than those which are only \" felt.\"\nIt will be convenient to examine the details of the\nasserted process under the following heads :\nI.

Communicators' Idea op how They convey Messages\nTO Feda.\nFather controlling. October 14:th, 1921.\nWhen I come to speak, Feda is frequently puzzled\nas to my meaning and fails to catch it either\nquickly or accurately. That is when I aru unable\nto make my meaning reach her in the iorm of\n\f54 G. Drayton Thomas. [part\nwords. If I then project a thought of some con-\ncrete object, Feda may remark \" I see so-and-so,\"\nbut though she may seem to be seeing the object,\nit is really my tliought of it which has reached her.\nEtta controlling. December 20th, 1921.\nC. D. T. How do you give your messages to Feda ?\nEtta. As a rule when I give Feda a message it goes by\nthought in blocks. Say that I wish to give \" I\nhave been in a garden at home lately.\" I should not\ngive it in bits, but in a complete thought first of\nall. Suppose she then asks me to give it again ;\nthe first attempt is already imprinted on her mind,\nbut not necessarily penetrating through to that\npart which is working upon the medium's brain.\nIt is not lost, but she may take time in getting\nthe thought through ; so I help by splitting up the\nsentence thus : \"I have been in a garden ... at\nhome . . . lately.\" This permits her to get clearly\nany part which she had missed. Feda's mind\nusually follows what I give, and while getting the\nfirst and second parts of a thought she would be\nmentally asking, \" When ? Long ago ? Lately ?\n\"\nand that prepares the way for me to give the\nother portion of it.\nSuppose I wish to say \" I have seen a rose in\nyour study.\" I should show a rose, giving the\nmental impression of a rose.\nC. D. T. Why change the method ?\nEtta. It depends upon conditions. At one jjart of a\nsitting, or perhaps during one whole sitting, Feda\nsees rather than hears. ExjDerienced communi-\ncators find out early in the sitting which would be\nthe best method for the occasion.\nC. U. T. Why is dumb-show sometimes employed and at other\ntimes symbols ?\nEtta. The reason is that we can give our ideas best so in\none sitting, and yet in anotlier it may prove easier\nto give them in words. With some mediums it\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 55\nmay be necessary to give everything in symbols ;\nother mediums receive it all by impression, and\nthis notwithstanding the fact that it is being\nspoken to them. Others thmk they are seeing\nclairvoyantly when they are not seeing, but are\nbeing told. You will notice that Feda says of\nsomeone, \" He has thick hair.\" But if, when you\ninquire about the moustache, she cannot see it,\nyou may infer that she is not really seeing, but\nis being told about it, and yet is not able to\nexplain through the medium's mind or brain what\nthe actual method at the moment is. Feda under-\nstands more than she can say, and she can get\nour messages in different ways.\nIt is not easy to play upon two senses at once.\nWhen passing from sight to hearing there is usually\na little gap between. For example, I might show\nFeda a shilling thus ; first the head, then the date.\nBut she might not be sure what it was ; so I\nwould then make her feel hardness, from which she\ncould gather that it was not a picture. Next I\nshould give her the feeling of hardness and cold-\nness but might not be able to do both simul-\ntaneously. That explains why she hesitates between\nfact and fact.\nC. D. T. There would seem to be a considerable gulf between\nyou and Feda while she is controlling.\nEtta. Her conscious part is then withm the medium, and\nlimited by the medium, because it works through\nthe medium's brain, a bram which is only respon-\nsive to a certain class of consciousness, feeling and\nsensation.\nFather controlling. January Qth, 1922,\nThe message is first given in block form, but\nif Feda does not absorb it, or if she gets only a\npart of it, then the rest is given in separate\nportions.\nC. D. T. I find it difficult to picture a thought given in block.\n\f50 G. Drayton Thoinas. [part\nFather. Quite SO, you have the habit of S23ealving or writing\nin words, but we are accustomed to think in whole.\n, At least this is true of experienced communicators,\nalthough newcomers would give their message in\nwords. Suppose someone were commg from Africa\nto see you, I might show Feda a ship and then\nthe kind of land the ship started from. That is\nan illustration of not giving the thought in block\nform.\nFather through Feda. November 24:th, 1922.\nFeda may not always know by what method an\nidea reaches her consciousness. For example she\nwill say, \" I hear the name Lily,\" when actually a\nlily has been pictured to her, or the idea of a lily\nimpressed on her mind. She says, \" I hear,\"\nbecause she has given herself the suggestion of\nhearing, and fails to realise that she has not\nactually heard it. Expecting to perceive ideas as\nsound, she thinks they come that way, even when\nthey are coming by sight.\nEtta controlling. November 2'ird, 1923.\nC. D. T. Do the j^ersons described really stand before Feda\nand look as she depicts them, or is it that they\nthrow thought-pictures of themselves to her ?\nEtta. Sometimes one and sometimes the other. She can\nsee and describe, but at other times she oidy gets\nthe idea. She cannot see or hear all the time\n\u2014\npart of one and part of the other. She sees and\nhears or she receives impressions. It seems to her\nsometimes as if she actually heard our voices.\nFeda is attuned more to us than you are.\nEtta controlling. October 3rd, 1924.\nC. D. T. When you sjjeak to Feda what is it that she hears ?\nEtta. It is a thought-vibration of my words, an idea of\nthe words. You know that on earth jjeople can\ntelepath the idea of an object, say a ring, without\nusing words. Yet the word \" ring is caught.\nSo do we use telejiathy ; with us it is more than\n\f107] The Modm Operandi of Trance Communication. 57\nspeech, and as a rule it is more correct. Sending\nactual words to Feda is more difficult than sending\nideas, but sometimes Feda gets our telepathy as\n'\nsound.\nEtta controlling. February 20th, 1925.\nC. D. T. How do you give Feda such impressions as coldness,\nhardness ?\nEtta. We have to appeal to her etheric sense of touch.\nShe would not feel it through the medium's\nphysical body. She can feel sad or happy, dif-\nferent states of mind, but this is another sense,\ntouch.\nC. D. T. Have you to feel it strongly yourself ?\nEtta. Yes, concentrating strongly on the sensation myself ;\noften a communicator fails because not able to\ntransmit the feeling through lack of this. Father\nhas good rapport with Feda.\nFather through Feda. April ilth, 1925.\nIf I send the thought of the letter \" H \" to Feda\nand she fails to recognise it, I then fall back upon\nanother form of communication, I project with all\nmy power the form of the letter \" H.\" That\ncamiot always be done. As a rule it is easier to\ngive Feda the idea of the letter. I can show\nFeda a mental picture. It is much as when\nhypnotisers project a mental picture which the\npatient sees, as if outside himself, as a solid object.\nYou have heard of the Indian juggler's rope trick,\na boy climbing up an unsupported rope. The\nboy is not there, but is a created picture, just as\nI create the letter \" H \" for Feda to see. Most\nmind-pictures are in the brain, but there are\na few people who can exteriorise that which is\nusually in the head. It is not a myth that that\ncan be done, and what can be done on your\nplane can be done with much greater facility on\nours.\n\f58 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\nEtta controlling. May 5th, 1925.\nFeda often takes some unimportant thought from\na communicator without his desire and she will use\nit to fill up and keep things moving ; for a long\nspell of silence w^ould make Feda lose hold of the\nmedium. This accoimts for trivial matters being\nbrought in disconnectedly at times.\nFather through Feda. May 15th, 1925.\nC. D. T. In creating a thought what is the thing resulting ?\nIs it actual movement in ether, or a semi-per-\nmanent shape which can travel through space ?\nFather. It might be either, sometimes one, then sometimes\nthe other. Feda knows that I have shown her a\ndefinite picture, not only a thought, and shown the\npicture so that she could see its colour. It is not\nalways necessary for my thought to travel to her ;\nit is possible for her to see a picture which I\nthink of ; she would reach my mind for that,\ninstead of my mind reaching her.\nYou know what symbolism is. We have a\ngreater jDower of symbolising thought automatically\nthan you have. With us, ideas can be symbolised.\nC. D. T. Like a shorthand or algebra for thought !\nFathke. I should more quickly express the idea of sacrifice\nby showing a cross.\nAs a rule Feda gets thought as a series of\nthought-waves which culminate in an expressed\nthought in her mind. Compare wireless trans-\nmission and receiver. If one were to intercept a\nmessage from the broadcasting it would not be\ntranslated without the appropriate machine.\nIt is suggested in the above quotation that Feda's\nmind can sometimes reach to, or merge with, that of the\ncommunicator. Perhaps if we understood the telepathic\nprocess we might better realise what this implies. Certain\nhypnotic experiments furnish examples of what appears to\nbe a unity of sensation between experimenter and subject.\n\f107] The Modus OjJerandi of Trance Communication. 59\nFather through Feda. August 1th, 1925.\nC. D. T. When Feda hears your voice are you usmg your\nvocal organs ? and do you similaiiy speak with\nyour hps when Feda only catches your ideas ?\nFather. T see your point. I am sometimes speaking with\nlips when Feda thinks she gets it impressionally.\nC. D. T. But j^our lips make no vibration of sound that I\ncan hear.\nFather. No particular advantage of one method over another,\ni.e. giving it to Feda with or without lip-move-\nment. But I try one method when I feel that at\nthe moment it will be the best method. Many of\nus get into the habit of using that method, or\ntrying to use it, because we did so at our first\nsitting, when trying to make ourselves known to\nyou. So many little identifications can be made\nwhen Feda can hear the tone of voice, with facial\nexpressions, lip-movement, etc. So, at first, we all\ntry to speak in our accustomed way, so that little\npoints of identification may be given. If Feda\nonly got things impressionally she might miss\nmany little points which help to convince you.\n(Here Feda interjected her remark :) I thuik that\nis right because many people make faces when they\ntalk.\nYour Father says, they get into habits and keep\nto them. We use one method in preference to\nanother, not always because the power is strong\nor weak, but more because of the type of power\nor condition, which is effected by the medium.\nIt is not necessary to move the lips when speak-\ning to Feda.\nYour father thinks that many sittings, especially\nwith normal mediums, are only helped through\nimpressions.\nC. D. T. I should think that a less sure method.\nFathee. You may see what they are driving at, getting near\nto, but they would express it differently if they\nwere able to hear. They onl\\' sense for it and\ngrope.\n\f60 G. Drayton Thoinas. [part\nC. D. T. When I hear your remarks given in a faint whisper\n. and then Feda immediately repeats the words with\n,j\nI\nthe medium's voice, is it that the medium's brain\n;\nautomatically repeats what it catches from you ?\nDoes Feda get your voice, or thoughts, from the\nmedium's brain, and also get them herself direct\nfrom you ?\nFejja. Feda often gets a sentence and says it over so\nthat communicators may have a chance of correcting\nit, and so as not to lose it before repeating it\nto you. Feda thinks the medium's brain might\nget any strong or worrying thought from the sitter,\nbut that would make the brain hard for Feda to\nwork. Feda thinks the medium's brain, by itself\nin this condition, is not active enough to catch\nthoughts from your Father : thinks it all depends\non Feda throwing thoughts on the medium's brain.\nAn appropriate thought might j^op up in the\nmedium's brain.\nB. Feda's Idea of how Messages reach Her.\nI now add remarks made by Feda in which she de-\nscribes, from her own point of view, how the messages\ncome to her.\nDecember 22nd, 1922.\nFkda. They try any way, feeling, seeing or hearing, but\nFeda finds feeling the easiest. They can suggest\nhot or cold, if the object they thinli of is metal.\nMuch is done by suggestion. They can make Feda\nfeel a thing is cold or hot, exactly as if she felt\nit with her fingers. You know how hypnotised\npeople can be made to feel like that.\nJanuary I9th, 1923.\nVkda. Feda used to make bad mistakes when they showed\nsymbols, because she did not understand them.\nSuppose they showed her a cross, she would know\nnow that they meant trouble. Until they explained\nwhat their symbols meant Feda used to get wrong\nover them. It is still difficult wlien new spirits\n\f107] The Modus Ojyerandi of Trance Communication\n.\n61\nshow them, but experienced spirits often come\n\u2022 '\nwith them to help and show what symbols to use.\n' They use them when it is too much trouble to\n'' '\nexplain their meanmg in words ; for there are\ntimes when Feda can see better than she can\nhear them.\nFeda. December 1th, 1923.\nC. D. T. I asked Feda how she came to give the name\n\" Salisbury so easily a few sittings back. Had\nshe met the name at any previous sitting ?\nFeda. Feda has not had that name here before. When\nnot trying at all Feda may get strange names\neasily. When you ask for the name it makes\nit difficult. Sometimes Feda can see and also\nhear it, at other times only hear or else only\nsee. But other times when things are poor Feda\ncan only feel\u2014sensing. One communicator who\nhad been biu-ned came here and was not able to\ntell Feda that. Yet made Feda smell burning and\nfeel heat, but when the idea had got through in\nthat way, it opened other ways for communication.\nYour Father says it is something like finding all\nwindows and doors locked except one ; on entering\nthe house through that one others can be unlocked\nfrom within. They may have to walk round and\nround trying one place and another first ; it is\nthat which gives people occasion to conclude that\nthey are fisliing, fumbling at it.\nThrough Feda. November 14th, 1924.\nFeda. Your Father says there are times when Feda cannot\nsee him, but only hears him. He wants to point\nout that when Feda cannot see him but only hears\nshe must have some way of locating him. Is it\nnot, he asks, by a light or misty substance ?\nQuite right, when Feda cannot see him Feda can\nsee something lilvc a light near the sitter or going\naway. Feda has had two or three sittings -R-ith a\nperson before seeing the communicator although\ngetting messages by feeling or hearing.\n\f62 C. Drayton Thomas. [pakt\nDo you prefer to see as well as hear and feel ?\nYes, and can do so with your Father and Etta.\nBut not all at once ?\nOnly sometimes, not often and only with experienced\ncommunicators whom Feda knows very well. Your\nFather says that possibly it is the mediums on the\nother side whom Feda can best see.\nFeda. ,\nJ^me 10th, 1925.\nWhat ? . . . Wait. . . . Cannot hear you. . . .\nIt is a nuisance. I was hearing him very well\njust then, but there is a vibration of voices coming\nnow which mixes it all uj). Can you shut the\nwindow ?\n(This break came in the midst of an interesting\npassage which flowed with ease and accuracy. I\nthen noticed, for the first time, a sound of voices\nin conversation outside the room where we were\nsitting. Two persons were talking on the lawn\noutside. I asked them to speak more softly and\nclosing the window, returned to my place. Feda\nthen said :)\nIt does not matter while your father talks\nmentally, but when he speaks in voice it does\nmatter. Although you cannot hear his voice, it\nsounds like a real voice to Feda while in the\nmedium, and it is more like your voice, because\nFeda listens to both of them from inside the\nmedium. When controlling Feda hears both the\nsitter's and the communicator's voices ; not always\nequally well, but sometimes so.\nYour father says that this is because Feda has\na double set of instruments to work with, her own\nand the medium's. He thinks these machines are\noccasionally interchangeable. He asks. Is it the\nmedium's etheric brain or Feda's brain which is\nused ? Either can be used, and the same pro-\ncess does not hold good even throughout one\nsitting.\nC. D. T.\nFed.i.\nC. D. T.\nFeda.\n\f107] The Modus OjJerandi of Trance Communication. 63\nc. Difficulties encountered.\nHaving now obtained a general idea of the asserted\nprocesses by which Feda is made aware of the com-\nmunicator's message, we turn to consider allusions to the\ndifficulties encountered.\n{a) Difficulties due to Feda.\nFather controlling. November 2\\st, 1919.\nI could not make Feda miderstand anything further\nthan the few particulars given through her just\nbefore I came into control to-day.\nC. D. T. Can you tell her everything after the sitting ?\nFather. Yes, easily, but not Avhile she is in the medium's\nbrain. Then it is like throwing a magic-lantern\npicture on a sheet which one camiot see, possibly\neven the sheet is not there at all.\nFather through Feda. March 5th, 1926.\n(Immediately after a fluent description came the\nfollowing remarks.)\nFathee. It is a curious thing that I have known about this\nfor some time, but was unable to broach it until\nnow. Something which Etta has been saying\nto-day made, as it were, an opening for this, the\none subject leading to the other. This difficulty\nis due entirely to seance conditions. There is diffi-\nculty in introducing an entirely new topic, intro-\nducing it to the medium's brain and to Feda.\nI frequently prepare the ground by using words\nwhich lead up to my subject, something akin to\nit, in whatever I am talking about previously.\nThe difficulty lies in this intermediate condition, and\nthe association of ideas is all-important. However,\nI am frequently able to broach an entirely new\nsubject and probably I find fewer difficulties than\ndo most communicators.\n\f64 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\n(6) Difficulties due to the communicatoes.\nI am not always aware what Feda says when in\ncontrol. I am mentally following up what I am\ngiving and so am not always noticing what she\nsays. Thus I am not clear as to whether she has\ngiven my thoughts rightly or wrongly. As when\ntelephoning, if a slip is made you may not realise\nhow it has been understood at the other end, and\nnot knowing that an error has occurred you cannot\nrectify it.\n(My father had been alluding to sittings for\ndirect voice and difficulty with memory there.)\nFatheb. Even here is not quite my own condition. I am\nnot as when I am on my own plane, not by any\nmeans.\nC. D. T. Could you not come straight here and throw your\nthoughts to Feda withoiit changing 1\nFather. I could do my part, but there would be no result\nfrom it. I must make myself, for the duration of\nthe sitting, a part of the particular condition. It\nis a slowing down to something. I am not at\nmy best, even when conditions are at their best.\nIt is a question of vibration and tuning-in. As\nsaid before, when I find myself in the vicinity of\nthe power,^ i.e. in a sitting, it has what I would\ncall a slightly muffling, even a deadening effect on\nmy memory and faculties. I do not see, remember,\nand feel with the same lucidity, as I do when not\ncommunicating. I am tuning down too much.\nEtta says, \" It is knowing and feeling this that\nmakes some people feel that it is bad for us, some\nidea of limitations imposed ; and they assume\ntherefore it must be bad. Father says, They\n1 By \" the power my communicator means that semi-physical emana-\ntion from the medium which is said to be indispensable to trance\ncommunication.

My com-\nmunicators agree that while they are in their usual con-\ndition, away from the medium's environment, they recol-\nlect with ease whatever they wish ; but that during a\nsitting it is freqiiently impossible to recall even such\nthings as they had especially intended to tell me.\nFather through. Feda. March 26th, 1920.\nI feel that I am not complete during a sitting.\nI have not my whole mental power of memory\nand consciousness, when returning to the spirit\nworld I feel like a man waking from partial sleep.\nYou know that if you are lying do^^'n you may\nbe aware of doors shutting and voices speaking,\nand yet not be sufficiently conscious to notice the\ndetails of a conversation, or to know why the\npeople are talking and moving about, then you\nsuddenly wake up to it all. That is what I feel\nlike ; it is as if one is half asleep here. One can\nbe perfectly comfortable when half asleep, but I\nhave not the full and perfect consciousness which\nis mine in my own sphere.\nC. D. T. You once said, \" When I come here I feel as if I\nhad left the best part of my mind behind.\" Can\nyou explain that further ?\nFather. I do not leave anything behind. I was wi\"ong in\nexpressing it so. It is that my mind will not\nfunction clearly in these conditions, it will not\noperate so well. The same thing applies to you if\nyou try to enter our sphere while in the body. A\nmedium who can see us and our surroundings does\nso in an imperfect way, an incomplete way, and\n\u2022\n\f66 C.

It results from functioning in a condition\nthat is not one's own.\nCompare it with a lamp ; take a fifty candle-\npower lamp into a clear atmosphere and it shines\na certain distance. Then take it into a fog and it\nshines a less distance. It is the same light\nalthough it may look to be only a fifteen candle-\npower lamp in the fog. I am like that ; I depend\nupon conditions here for the effect I can produce.\nFather through Feda. January 1th, 1921.\n(Certain details of a test message having been\nsuccessfully given, I inquii'ed whether my father\ncould give any further particulars about it.)\nFather. When away from here I know more about it.\nC. D. T. Could you remember anything further if we spent\nfive minutes waiting for it ?\nFather. I might or might not ; for I am now in the \" under\nsea \" condition. Etta has, on occasion, gone away\nto get remembrance of what we required, but on\nreturning forgot again before she could tell me.\nThe different conditions are baffling, but I can\nremember now better than when I first commenced\ncommunicating.\nFather through Feda. June 10th, 1925.\nFeda. Your father wished to say something about your\nwork, but cannot quite place it now. He thinks\nyou will learn later.\nC. D. T. Does he know definitely what it was ?\nFeda. He says, I know when away and in my own con-\nditions.\nC. D. T. Then he does not remember now ?\nFeda. No, but has the uncomfortable feeling that he ought\nto know. This forgetfulness would worry some\npeople ; he thinks that it puzzles many com-\nmunicators.\n\f107] The Modus Oinramli nf Trcmce Covrmuvicafion. 67\nFather and Etta throvgh Feda. August 20th, 1927.\nC. D. T. Your mind is to some extent blurred and limited\nwhile here ?\nFather. I do not think that my conscious mind during a\nsitting changes in itself, but that this condition in\nwhich I find myself alters its range of activity.\nEtta. Etta says, Well, suppose you have a bell, and you\nring it in an empty room. The result is beauti-\nfully clear. Contrast that with what would happen\nwhen you rang it in a room that was padded,\ncushioned and had a good deal of upholstery.\nYet the bell would be the same instrument, and\nits striking would be just the same ; but the\nresult would be different because of the different\ncondition in which you made it sound.\nFather. Your father says that he can think of no other\nsense in which he is limited except in memory,\nwhich of course is closely allied to consciousness.\nHe says, I do not feel in any sense a spiritual\ndepreciation. He wishes to make that very\ndefinite.\nThis difficulty with memory is further explained in the\nextracts dealing with experiences of personal control.\nThey are given in the section II. (b) (see below, p. 84).\n(d) Material prepared beforehand by Communicator.\nMy communicators say that, in view of their tendency\nto forget, they make a practice of preparing a certain\namount of material beforehand. I have noticed many\nindications pointing to such preparation.\nEtta through Feda.

December 7th, 1923.\nWhen I decide to bring evidence from others which\nyou can verify by questioning their friends on\nearth, I ask them for a few things which will\nserve to prove identity.

She will\nsay, \" Wait . . . Feda did not get that . . . What ? . . .\nWait a minute.\" Many of the messages contain internal\nevidence tliat some portion has been omitted, or mutilated\nin transmission.\nHere are some of Feda's remarks about this :\nAugust 4th, 1922.\nFeda. (Referring to my father.) I think he wants Peda to\nunderstand something which he knows but cannot\nquite get through to Feda.\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. GO\nC. D. T. Can he not tell you plainly in words ?\nFedA. He could tell Feda, but Feda caiuiot hear.\nC. D. T. How is that ?\nFeda. Feda can hear part, and part not, is able to hear\nsome of it to-day but not all of it.\nHe used to refrain from trying a thing if it\n:\n\"\nwere difficult to get through, but now he tries\nbecause it is interesting. People often wonder why\nthere seem to be such extraordinary gaps in a\nsitting, -not natural sequences. A communicator\nhas to break off and leave out something which he\nknows it would be hopeless, or risky, to try and\nget through. So that often a sitting seems dis-\njointed, fragmentary. He now feels the risk less\nand so risks it when he comes to such a pohit.\n- September 19th, 1924.\nFeda. (After a somewhat confused sentence.) Feda thinks\nshe has not got his idea quite right, she heard\nsome of his words as he spoke them, but could\nnot get the impression quite. When he gives\nAvords, and follows them up with an impression,\nthen Feda knows it is right.\nJmie loth, 1925.\nFeda. (Addressing the communicator.) I camiot get that\n... try agaui . . . (turning to me). Do you know\nthere are times when I really hear him, and yet get\nonly muddled sounds, not properly formed sounds.\nHe says it again, and if it does not get clearer he\nhas to show it, or get it through in some other way.\nHe does not always know when he has failed to\nmake Feda hear, and goes on with it. Then, if\nasked to repeat, he may not know what part Feda\nhas not heard, and then there is a muddle of\nmistakes. He says there is a good deal to learn\nabout it still.\n(\/) Omissions sometimes confuse the Sense of\nMessages.\nThe omission of important parts of a message easily\nreduces it to confusion. Feda is aware of gaps in her\n\f70 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\ntransmission, although she does not always mention them\nat the time. It is particularly unfortunate when she fails\nto notice that a fresh topic has been begun ;\nfor, by\nrunning on with the new subject as if it continued the\nprevious one, she risks making the whole appear untrue.\nI recall how, during my first sitting, facts which correctly\nrelated to a second person were given as if applying to\none who had just before been described. The result was\nthat, at the time, I regarded this section of the sitting\nas inaccurate, and only on examining it afterwards did\nthe merging of two distinct descriptions, both of them\nminutely correct, become apparent.\nDecember 6th, 1917.\nFeda. Teda cannot hear all he says all the time. Isn't it\na nuisance ? Have to catch parts, like when many\nthings are thrown at you and you catch what you\ncan. Feda rarely hears all that is said.\nAugust 21st, 1925..\nYour father says that he may be unable to continue\nthe present topic next time.\nBut camiot he plainly tell you it is coming ?\nHe might plainly tell me, but I might not catch it.\nAt nearly every sitting there is something which\nFeda knows she has not caught. It is like losing\nsomething and not being able to pick it up agam.\nCommunicators seem unable to repeat, or else it is\nthat Feda can't catch the rejjetition.\n(g) Mixed Messages.\nIn the following extract Feda refers to a further possible\ncause of confusion.\nNovember Mth, 1924.\nFeda. After a sitting is over Feda sometimes finds that\nthere has been someone present who did not get\ninto the i)ower,^ although they had tried to do so.\nBut although they did not get ui themselves, some\nof their thoughts became mixed up with those of\nthe comnuniicator. This often happens when more\n^ For explanatioa of the power,\" see pp. 72-78.\nFeda.\nC. D. T.\nFeda.\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 71\nthan one spirit person is present and when the\ncommunicator is not well known to Feda. It is\nnot always easy to know who is giving the mes-\nsages. There is not, however, much fear of con-\nfusing what your father says with anything said\nby someone who is outside the circle of power.\n{h) General Ideas more easily received by Feda than\nSPECIFIC Words.\nIt would appear that Feda easily receives from the\ncommunicator anything in the nature of a general idea,\nbut that specific words or names present a difficulty with\nwhich she often fails to deal satisfactorily.\nFather through Feda. May 1th, 1920.\n(My father had made numerous allusions to his\nfather, but had failed to state either the name or\nthe relationship. I remarked that we both under-\nstood clearly who was being spoken of, but that\nI should like him to say definitely whom he had\nin mind.)\nFathek. To put anything in a specific form is most difficult\nof aU.\nC. D. T. Why so ?\nFather. I have to dodge a machine. You see there is the\nmedium's brain, and Feda manipulating that brain,\nand I have to dodge both. I find I get things\nthrough most easily when I take Feda ofi her\nguard, when she is not looking for a word or\nname. You remember how easily names have\nsuddenly come through. When there is a great\neffort and Feda is aware that I am trying, she\nholds the brain in a strained condition. Suppose\nyou are about to play a game, or something of\nthat kind, say to shoot at a target ; if you know\nyou must hit the bull's-eye or not make the\nattempt, you will have less chance of success than\nif you think it does not matter whether you do\nit or not. Anyone anxiously waiting to see you\nhit the bull's-eye makes for you a shghtly strained\n\f72 C. Drayton Thomas. [i'ART\ncondition, this strained condition is not with me,\nbut with Feda.\nFeda. October 15th, 1920.\n(Somethmg is in course of being described, but\nFeda stumbles and is in difficulty over it.)\nFeda. Feda sees and feels it, but does not hear.\nC. 1). T. Cannot they make their words plain to you ?\nFeda. When they concentrate on one thing, and one thing\nonly, it becomes hard. While talk flows it is\neasy, but when it comes to one thing, or one word,\nand no other will do then we stick fast. When\nspeakuig fails they show something, or try to make\nFeda feel.\nFather controlling. September 3rd, 1920.\n(During the early part of this sitting Feda had\nbeen unsuccessful in giving the name of my father's\nold colleague, Benjamin Browne, although I had\nclearly recognised that he was the person alluded to,\nboth from the description and the name, Benjamin,\nwhich came through. We spent some time over\nit, and I even went so far as to ask Feda whether\nthe name required was not that of a colour, but\nFeda Avas unable to put it through. When my\nfather was controlling he remarked :)\nFathek. You must wonder what is doing when you ask for\na simple name like Browne and I cannot give it.\nC. D. T. Was Browne the name you wanted Feda to say\nearlier in the sitting ?\nFather. Yes, and so I got it here. I dropped the attempt\ntill I could introduce it mj^self.\nFather controlling. Sejitember 1st, 1922.\nThere are times during my speaking through Feda\nwhen I could not tell you that something had\nhappened \"to-day,\" nor should I be able to say\nthe word \" yesterday.\"\nD. \" The Power,\" or Mediumistic Emanation.\nIt is a feature of these sittings that the class of\nmaterial which is at one time given quite easily, at\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 73\nanother time seems to present an obstacle to efiEective\ntransmission. It would seem that the medium's recep-\ntivity is variable, that her brain and mind are not always\nequally responsive. One asserted cause of this is fre-\nquently mentioned ; Feda terms it \" the power.\" There\nis some evidence for the existence of this, and it would\nseem to be an emanation which plays an important part\nin heightening the sensitivity of the medium's brain. It\nis to variations in the amount, consistency, or other con-\ndition of this emanation that my communicators attribute\nmuch of their difficulty in communicating.\nRightly or wrongly Feda and my communicators regard\n\" the power \" as something existing in space. I will\nbriefly record their view by summarising statements given\nin reply to my requests for information. Thus :\nMedium and sitter are surrounded by a cloud of this\npower. Anything within this area is visible to Feda ;\nbut should a communicator remain outside it he would\nbe invisible to her, and she could only with some diffi-\nculty obtain information from him by \" sensing.\" Upon\nhis entering the zone or sphere of influence, Feda would\nbe able to see and hear him.\nThis quasi-physical cloud emanates from the medium,\nand the sitter may contribute some small amount. Al-\nthough usually visible to both control and communicator,\nthe latter can, by passing out of it and then re-entering,\nfeel its influence as a slight tingling.\nIts presence or absence is inferred by results :\nIf no medium were present we should feel a lack of\nsomething after a few moments' attempt to control ; that\nis how we do feel with a poor medium.\nThe cloud of emanation is kept fresh and living by a\ncontinued flow from the source. When this flow ceases,\na sitting automatically ends. Nothing then remains to be\nre-absorbed by the medium.\nDuring a sitting this cloud of emanation will become\ndissipated if allowed to grow inert. Activity is essential. A\nlong silence, or a pronounced lack of sympathy in the sitter,\nwould act detrimentally upon it and induce evaporation.\n\fI\n74 G. Drayton Thomas. [part\nWhen the emanation is ebbing, it may be made to\nflow freely again by the discreet introduction of a mental\nincentive. A sitter should try to combine with his\nmental passivity an alertness which can throw living\ninterest into the sitting at appropriate moments, thus\nkeeping the tide of emanation fresh and full until it has\nbeen used to the end.\nThe emanation varies in quality even with the same\nmedium, and still more so between different trance-mediums ;\nwhile that produced by mediums in sittings for physical\nphenomena is of a denser kind. All people possess it,\nbut with the great majority it is not available : medium-\nship is the condition which frees this emanation for use.\nIt is sometimes set free by emotional shock, but more\noften by a course of psychical development.\nIn physical mediumship, where the output of emanation\nis considerable, any disturbance which causes a sudden\nindrawing of this etheric matter may have injurious effects\nupon the medium.\nSo far my communicators.\nOn one occasion a scientifically-minded acquaintance\nspoke with me a few months after his passing. He\nremarked with interest upon something which he described\nas smoke curling around my wife who sat between the\nmedium and the window. Feda once spoke of being able\nto just see a bar of light coming to her from the com-\nmunicators, and moving from one to the other as they\ntook turn in speaking to her. I can only assume that\nthese two descriptions were founded upon a partial glimpse\nof something upon the border-line of visibility.\nAssuming the existence of this emanation, one asks\nwhat function it fulfils 1 My communicators say that,\ninter alia, it heightens the sensitivity of the medium's\nbrain, and thus renders it better able to receive the\nthoughts which are to be transmitted.\nSometimes a new and unjDractised communicator is des-\ncribed as wandering out of the sphere of this emanation\nand thereby checking communication. When I took a\nwidower anonymously to a Leonard sitting, he sat some\ndistance away from the medium. Feda presently remarked\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 75\nthat his wife, who had. begun to speak, had gone to\nhim and was now too far away for Feda to keep in\neasy touch with her. Communication from that\ndistance seemed to be checked. I have noticed that\nwith new communicators Feda begs them to come nearer\nto her.\nFeda's memory is, as a rule, remarkably retentive, yet it\nbecomes so weakened at the close of a sitting that she can-\nnot recall details of a subject discussed at the beginning\nof the same sitting, and she complains that there is not\nsufficient power to enable her to \" think back.\"\nI once asked Feda to tell me by whom this loss of\npower was felt at the end of a sitting. She replied that\nnot only did she feel it herself, but that the communi-\ncator would feel that there was nothing linking him to\nher, or enabling him to know if she were catching his\nthoughts.\nWhen, at the end of his twelfth attempt at personally\ncontrolling the medium, my father remarked that the\npower was failing, I persisted in questioning him for\nanother ten minutes. Although he continued to reply the\nvoice became rapidly weaker, finally ending in a faint\nwhisper. On another such occasion he concluded, \"It is\nno use trying further, I cannot keep it up . . . power\ngone.\" Etta ended her first attempt at personal control\nby remarking, \" I cannot explain further now, there is no\nmore power.\" Both have repeatedly described their feel-\nings at this stage of a sitting. The following are selections\nfrom their remarks :\n1. \"It is as if the brain were tired out and it is no use\nstruggling with it.\"\n2. \"I can neither think nor remember so well now as\nearher.\"\n3. \" My thoughts wander and I have no grasjj.\"\n4. \"I cannot think weU now, it seems more effort, as\nwhen one is sleepy and trying to remember some-\nthing. It is a very strange sensation.\"\n5. \"I cannot collect my thoughts so well. There are\nmany things I want to talk about. I almost forget\n... it seems to me that I have forgotten.\"\n\f7G C. Drayton Thomas. [part\n6. \" As the power goes I feel as if sinking down lower into\nthe medium, a curious feeling.\"\n7. \"I know, but am not going to reply to that question\nnow. I know, but fear the right reply will be\nrejected. It is like having a small keyboard when\nyou have to play a note beyond its compass. I\nam not so afraid at the start of controlling, but now\nthere comes a stupid feeling, one cannot quite con-\ncentrate ; it is like when one is a little tired, but\nwithout the tired feeling.\"\n8. \" I must stop now, or I shall say something silly.\"\n9. \" The power is going fast. When I lose power I begin\nto feel sleepy and thoughts only come stupidly and\ndi'owsily.\"\nHaving experienced the effects of lessening power, not\nonly as communicators, but also as controls, my father\nand sister became able to understand Feda's difficulties\nmore clearly than would have been otherwise possible.\nApropos of this one of them remarked :\nApril 2Slh, 1922.\nI feel my thoughts wandering. We notice this when\nthe power goes while we control. When we were speak-\ning through Feda, and it happened, we thought that she\nwas getting stupid. Now we know what it is. There\nseems to begin a real waking of the medium's mind, an\nindependent movement, and so we get mixed up with\nthings in her mind. The two being mingled it distorts\nmy messages.\nThey both agree that it is ixnsafe to start topics of\nimportance at the end of a sitting. Occasionally, after\nmy father has intimated failure of power, his attention\nhas been attracted by Etta ; he has then succeeded in\nascertaining her meaning, yet failed to get it spoken in\nanything stronger than the faintest whispers. At one\nsuch time he wished to say, as I was perfectly aware,\nthe letter \" P,\" but he could only speak thus :\nMay nth, 1923.\nThe letter is not one at the beginning of the alphabet,\nbut far on, one easily mistaken for the letter\n\f107] The Modus Opprandi of Trance Commnnicaliov . 11\n\" B,\" which was given in error. I must ask Etta,\nM'lio can only give me signs ; for I camiot hear\n\u2022\n'\n. her now at this lapse of joower. ... It is the\nlower part of that \" B \" that is wrong. That\nsounds absiu-d, I know, but we have to get it in\none way w^hen we cannot in another.\nEtta says : ^\nOctober 3rd, 1924.\nWhen we are within this Sphere of Influence we\nare not in our own condition, but in a fog,\nmentally as well as physically, and cannot re-\nmember so well. While I am within it I might\nnot be able to see father though he were standing\nonly two feet outside it. The emanation fluctuates\nlike wind on windy days, when you may hear a\nrush and it dies down again, before gathering force\nand blowing up once more. Our trouble is that\nwe cannot tell when it is ebbing, and so waste\ntime trying to get something on when it is ebbing\nwhich could only be done when its tide is full.\nMy conimunicators insist that sitters should refrain from\nholding in mind any dominant thought, or persistently\ndemanding some j)articular name, for such mental tension\non the part of a sitter is said to attract the emanation\ntowards himself and away from both communicator and\ncontrol, thus rendering their task more difficult.\nMy father says : 3Iarch 20th, 1925.\nI have noticed occasionally, when some question\nhas been put by the sitter, that a communicator\nhas receded and appeared to lose grasp, yet a\nlittle later he returns suddenly and is able, in\nsome instances, to supply the correct answer to\nthe question. What has happened is that he has\nwithdra'wn himself from within the emanation in\norder to try and remember the fact asked for,\nand yet it would appear as if the control were\nstill obtaining information from him.\n(Here Feda interposed with the remark :) Feda\n. . : knows that - sometimes, though she cannot com-\n\f78 C. Drayf on Thomas. [part\nmimicate well with people outside it, yet she is\nable to get easy things from them.\nJanuary lOth, 1919.\nFeda. At times he can get through a difficult thing, while\nat other times, even an easy one is impossible.\nHe has to throw words to Feda, while she throws\nthem magic-lantern fashion upon the medium's\nmind. Then, too, if he wakes Feda's curiosity she\nholds the brain tight, and that fixes him. We\ncan get through one minute what we cannot do\nat another time. The power lying over the brain\nis never still, all is changing.\nII. From Control to Sitter.\n(a) Transmission through the Medium's Organism, her\nMind and Brain.\nWe now pass to the next step in the process of trans-\nmitting a message. It would appear that, on becoming\naware of the thought to be transmitted, Feda operates\nupon the medium's brain. One says \" brain \" for short,\nbut I think it certain that the medium's mind is still to\nsome degree alert. It is upon this brain and mind that\nFeda works, imj)ressing it to action by her thought and\nwill. Feda tells me that it is not always easy to exert\nthis influence successfully ; that it is essential to ensure\nthat the message is \" taken,\" otherwise it may, to use\nher own phrase, \" drop out of the medium \" instead of\nbeing voiced.\nJanuary 7th, 1921.\n(While transmitting details of a newspaper test,\nFeda said :)\nFeda. Very close to that is a name \" E,\" it looks like\nEdward, yes, I am sure it is Edward, but I said\n\" E \" because of not being sure that I could get\nthe name Edward through correctly.\nHere it would seem that Feda had received the name\nfrom the communicator (and subsequently verification\nproved its correctness), but doubted her ability to get it\nexpressed by the medium's lips. Feda frequently mentions\n\f107] The Mbdtis OperanrJi of Trance Communication. 79\nonly the initial letter of names, yet it by no means\nfollows that she has failed to catch the complete name\ncorrectly. To ensure its being spoken is a real difficulty.\nEtta controlling. February 3rd, 1922.\nIs it not strange that I cannot say my husband's\nname ? I can feel it but camiot say it ; that is,\nI cannot get it spoken. I get it on the surface\nbut cannot get it into the medium's mind. I am\naware of it myself without being able to get it\nspoken.\nFebruary 9th, 1923.\nFeda. Feda pictiu-es something and wills it and that sets\nthe medium's mind going. Suppose I wished to\ngive the picture of an apple, it would be necessary\nto think strongly of an apple, make a pictiu-e of\nit and put it on her mind. Feda tries to jump\non the right part of the medium's brain, but often\nfumbles, it is like touching the wrong string.\n(Here I asked Feda how she found the right\nspot on the brain. She replied :)\nFeda. When Feda has got a picture of the apple it feels\nlike holding it up above the medium's brain. Feda\nfeels it as if it were being drawn to a right place,\nattracted to a right part, but it has to be held\ntUl it is attracted there. Feda wriggles it about\nuntil she feels that it connects, that it is taken\nup ; but all that is done with the mmd, not with\nhands. Feda thinks of the brain as something\nalive with sense in it. It is a little like a game\nin the dark when someone has to catch what you\nare holding. Feda pushes it towards one part,\nthen towards another part, until it is taken.\n(My sister interposed at this point to explain\nthat this shiftmg-process did not necessarily mean\nmovement from place to place, but a changing of\nthe idea of the apple. Feda then continued :)\nAt last it feels like something sucking it in, like\n- taking in a breath. All that does not take as\nlong as it sounds in describing. Whole sentences\n\fso C. Drayion Thomas. -\n[part\ncan be done quickly .sometimes. The best flow of\nwords is wlien long ideas are being worked out ;\nthat kind of talk is much easier than giving some\nspecific thing like apple or orange. It would be\nmore difficult to say \" An apple on your jjlate\nthis morning,\" than to give a long philosophical\ndisquisition, or analysis of character.\nMay nth, 1923.\nFeda. (While transmitting for my father :) A picture of\nyour Mother suddenly jumped in this. I did not\nwait to ask your father what he meant by it, lest\nwhat I wished to say should drop out of the\nmedium. Things sort of spill over if I do not\nkeep them fixed on her brain. If I wait to ask\nanything, then what I am holding there may\nrun out.\nHere I add further remarks on this subject, in which\nmy communicators try to explain the process. Having\nthemselves controlled the medium they speak from\nexjierience.\nFather through Feda. November Wth, 1921.\nFed A. Your father says that he refrains from saying many\nthings which he wishes to give lest they should\ncome through in a distorted form. Feda feels that\nalso ; for she does not always make the medium's\nvoice speak as intended. Feda touches something\nwhich wakes the medium's mind and then it goes\noff on its own account.\nC. D. T. Feda, can you hear the words spoken by the medium ?\nFeda. Yes, but cannot stop her speaking if what she says\nis wrong. Often Feda cannot get the power to\ncheck the words.\nYour father says that over-pressure taps the sub-\nconscious mind of the medium and then something\nescapes before Feda can stop it. Even after hear-\ning those escapes and inaccuracies, Feda cannot always\nso control the medium's mind as to put things right.\nAs each thought is given it is fixed on the co-\noperative mind which is created partly by the\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 81\nmedium and partly by Feda. Once it is registered\nthere a counter-suggestion is not easily put\nthrough. Your father says that Feda thinks she\nworks directly upon the medium's brain, but he does\nnot consider that this is entirely accurate. He\nsays that Feda really works upon the medium's\nmind-essence which, in its turn, works the brain.\nThis mind-essence belongs to the medium's organ-\nism. To take a simUe ; Feda puts a match to\nthe gas, this gas is not Feda's, but its light might\nbe termed hers, and she can regulate it. Feda\nhas produced a quite wonderful manifestation\nwhich draws its supply from the medium. That\nmay explain why Feda is occasionally less brilliant\nthan at other times ; if it were Feda's own gas\nit would always be equal, but being the medium's,\nit varies. Yes, your father is sure that Feda is\nwrong in thmking that she works the medium's\nbrain. It is the mind in the brain which Feda\nworks. In the case of a trance or controlled medium,\nthat part of the mind which is quiescent is not so\nlikely to reproduce impressions itself as is the mind\nof a normal medium.\nFeda gives to the medium's mind and that mind\nthen works the brain. Feda telepaths on to the\nmedium's mind, much as the communicators tele-\npath to Feda, but the operation is so instantaneous\nthat Feda can scarcely realise in detail what is\nhappening.\nC. D. T. Feda, did you find the medium's brain respond to\nyour efforts as easily when you first learnt to\ncontrol, as it does now ?\nFeda. No, it was dreadfully difficult then. Your father\nsays. That bears out my assertion ; for Feda was\nthen working upon the medium's mind, and foimd\nit difficult work owing to lack of practice and\nexperience. But had Feda been working direct\nupon the brain, the trouble caused by the confused\nmental conditions of an undeveloped medium would\nnot have arisen.\nD\n\f82 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\nEtta controlling. April 27th, 1923.\nC. D. T. Do you remember a birthday ?\nEtta. I spoke of it at a recent sitting.\nC. D. T. Can you say whose it is ?\nEtta. I remember, but cannot say it, cannot get it spoken.\nThe more I try to think it on, the less I can get\nit on. I am expressing myself in a particular way,\nand it is the medium's power of expression which\nI cannot control. One can get a word in the\nmind and yet not be able to express it.\nC. D. T. Does her brain automatically express the thought put\ninto it ?\nEtta. Because it is in the mind it does not follow that her\nbrain will take it. Unless the things in mind are\ntapped on to the actual brain one cannot express\nthem. Like a t3^pewriter, when you think your\nwords, but unless you tap the right key, you will\nnot get the letters. You can put your finger on\nthe right key, but unless you tap it there is no\nexpression. The brain takes, or does not take,\nfrom the mind. The brain is like a keyboard,\nautomatically responsive to us, but often respond-\ning in a wrong way ; we wish to press keys and\nput expression through, but if we try too much for\na certain word, the keys get stiff with\u2014apprehen-\nsion. When in painting you stiffen muscles which\nyou should not, then anxiety makes it still worse\n\u2014and so with words. When I cannot get them\nI pretend to forget and thus relieve the tension and\nthe \"key\" then relapses into its ordinary condition.\nSometimes, a little while afterwards it will come out,\njust as when Father first spoke to you of me.\nOne might not be able to say one's own name.\nC. D. T. Can you say yours now ?\nEtta. Etta, but possibly if a sitter here with you were to\nask it I might not get it that time, but might say\n\" Raw.\" ^ Strange, but it is the human instru-\nment which makes it so difficult. If only a\n' Raw was her married name.\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 83\nmechanical one could be made ! But mind is the\nbridge between the spirit and the physical.\nEtta controlling. August ^\\st, 1923.\nC. D. T. Are you aware what words are spoken by the\nmedium's lips while in control ?\nEtta. I know what the words are afterwards, but they slip\nthrough before I realise. I know after, but cannot\npull them back if wrong.\nC. D. T. Does the medium's brain colour the expression of her\nthoughts to an appreciable extent ?\nEtta. Yes, if it is more natural for a medium to put them\nin a certain way, then, although I might give\nthem in my way, yet they would go through in\nhers. If she were fond of the word \" extra-\nordinary '\nand I of \" extremely \" hers would be\ngiven, rather than mine ; that does not always\nmatter. I think I feel that less than most people\nwould, that it happens less often. I knew so\nmuch more about this when here than did many\ncommunicators\n.\nIn passing through it might be moulded into\nsomething with almost a different meaning. Not\nso with me, for I feel what things might be\ncoloured and so refrain from giving them in a way\nwhich affords the chance of being coloured. We\nhave to contend with Feda's mind and personality\nas well as the medium's. Owing to Feda's practice\nin helping thmgs through the medium, it is easier\nto get things through ; she can manipulate the\ni\nmedium's mind better than we can, and yet she\nherseK is a difficulty. If I wish to speak to you\nof two things, one very pretty and the other\niminteresting to Feda, it would be more difficult\nto get the latter owmg to her preference for the\nformer.\nFather through Feda. April llth, 1926.\nC. D. T. Does Feda ever find that your thought has reached\nthe medium's mind direct ? Or must it always go\nto Feda first ?\n\f84 C Drayton Thomas. [part\nFather. Feda might find a thought in the medium's brain\nand understand that I have thrown it there ; she\nwould then cause it to be spoken. But Feda\nusually knows what I send to her own mind, and\nshe then impresses it on the medium's brain. I\nthink Feda succeeds in doing it either way.\nC. D. T. But would not the medium's brain automatically\ncause the thought to be spoken if catching it before\nit reached Feda ?\nFather. No, consider how, during sleep, your mind holds\npictures, images, thoughts. Does your tongue\ntherefore sjaeak them ? Certainly not, although the\nimages may be as vivid as a waking experience.\nFeda can manage it either way. She often catches\nwhat I say before she puts it through ; but the\nwhole operation is either instantaneous, or nearly\nso. She would scarcely be able to say which\ncame first.\n(Feda here added, on her own account, that\nwhile controlling she does not actually know\nwhether she gets the thoughts from the communi-\ncator, or from the medium's brain. But what she\ndoes know most certainly is that she often fails to\nget something which she ought to get.)\n(b) Direct Control by Communicator.\nUp to this point we have examined Feda's control.\nLet us now see what is said to happen when my father\nor my sister, taking Feda's place, transmit their thoughts\ndirect to the medium.\nIt seems that forgetfulness is still a limitation ; much\nknowledge which they are aware of possessing is no longer\nwithin reach. They say, \" One of our greatest difficulties\nwhen controlling is our divided memory.\" Their condition\nwould seem to correspond to that, so familiar to ourselves,\nwhen we fail to recall a name. We are aware that we\nknow it, and that we would recognise it if we heard it\nspoken. We may even succeed in recalling it by some\nline of association, but all direct efforts are futile.\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 85\nIt is said that during personal control there are several\nmatters demanding simultaneous attention ; there is the\ncare of the medium's organism, and the necessity of\nobserving what will \" take \" and what fails to take. xJjThe\ncontroller must also endeavour to mark what is actually\nspoken, and to avoid starting a flow of words which would\nmisrepresent his meaning. When such a flow is once\nstarted it may be difficult to check, and practical^\nimpossible to follow it up with a contradiction or explana-\ntion.\nMy sister says that she does not know the exact moment\nat which she gains effective control of the medium's\norganism. This probably explains why one hears Feda\nwhispering in apparent conversation with the communi-\ncators before the sitting actually begins.\nIt has been my fortunate experience to watch the\nprogress of two controls, namely my father and my sister,\nfrom the day when they first became such by dispensing\nwith Feda's help and spoke to me directly thi'ough Mrs.\nLeonard's^ lips.\nFather controlling. June \\4:th, 1920.\n(When commencing his control the voice was\nmuch famter than usual. He began thus :)\nFather. Feda has not left me much power to-day. She\nstayed a long time. I have lost my bearings\ncoming like this. There is something I wished to\nsay. I have forgotten it while gettiug into control,\nbut had it in my mind previously. When I\ncontrol a portion of my mind is left outside. I\nam using the medium's brain by throwing my\nthoughts upon it, throwing thoughts one by one\non to it, and am unable to think quickly of one\nthing after another as I normally do.\nFather controlling. August ISth, 1920.\nC. D. T. When controlling do you will your thought in the\nsame way as we in the physical body do, when\nwe will to speak and our bram does the rest ?\nFatheb. Remember that my will and this good woman's\nbrain are not coimected ; the method is the same\n\f86 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\nbut with a difference in the willing. Sometimes\nI throw a thought on her brain and it remains\ninactive, so I leave it there while speaking of other\nsubjects. Presently I may notice that the latent\nthought begins to stimulate her brain into action,\nand then I at once drop the second subject and\nrevert to the first which can now be carried on.\nThere is some analogy with your trying to remember\nsomething which eludes you, and, after you cease\nto try, it suddenly appears in your mind later and\nyou can take it up and go on with it. It seems\nas if the less one tries, the more easily does the\nbrain take up the thought. Hence I usually give\nup trying when failing to get my theme through,\nhowever much I may desire it, and do not waste\ntime attempting to force it.\nC. D. T. Do you think that you could give, through Feda,\nany statement which she or the medium strongly\nobjected to ?\nFather. I do not thmk it would be difficult to do that.\nEtta controlling, October \\st, 1920.\n(On the occasion of this my sister's first control\nI had no warning that she was about to make\nthe attempt. But I noticed that the change of\ncontrol was taking a much longer time than usual,\nand when the voice commenced it was slow and\nfaint.)\nEtta. I am trying . . . not father. I shaU do it. I want\nto. Can you hear better now ? I shall speak\nmore distinctly soon. S\u2014S\u2014S\u2014S (the sibilants\nwere clear and prolonged). I cannot manage her\nbreath. I shall soon do it. Yes, now I think it\nit is better . . . when I speak like that. I do not\nmake the whistlmg sound. I wish to speak clearly,\ndistinctly and well. I am so glad to be able to\nspeak. I shall do it in time.\n(Etta continued in control for twenty-nine\nmmutes, and towards the end of that time was\nspeaking somewhat easily. She succeeded in pro-\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 87\nnouncing several relevant names, although failing\nto give others for which she was evidentlj^ trying.\nA few weeks later Etta controlled for the second\ntime. Among other things she said :)\nI want to practice names of people. I want to\nremember the sound of words while controlling and\nto make the lips sound, to give her brain the\nnames and make her lips say them. But it is\ndifficult to think, I fail to connect up my ideas.\nEven now I have a strong consciousness of having\nbeen often with you, but I find no detailed recol-\nlection of the things we have done. Do not tell\nme anything ; I wish to practice remembering.\n(During Etta's fifth time of controlling she suc-\nceeded in describing with accuracy a young officer\nwho had recently died, and she transmitted several\nmessages from him for his father. These messages\nwere rich in evidential items and convinced the\nfather of his son's identity.\nEtta said that she was doing her best to give\nas much as possible, but added :)\nThe extraordinary thing about it is that, although\nhe told me so much, I am now unable to recall\nit all. But later, when away from here, I shall\nremember everything.\nFather through Feda. November Wth, 1921.\nFeda. Your father says he knows the intricacies of con-\ntrolling, not only by observing Feda, but through\ndoing it himself. He brings only a part of his\nintelligence into the medium's mind. All your\nmind is not in, or acting upon, your brain at one\nand the same time. You have your conscious and\nyour subconscious mind. His mind also develops\na conscious and subconscious section when he\ncomes here, and in controlling he is sure that he\nworks only a small detached part of his mind\nwithin the medium's mind. The part left outside\nthe medium's mind forms, for the moment, his.\n\f88 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\nsubconscious mind, but he is still in touch with\nit, just as you are in touch with your subconscious\nmind.\nC. D. T. Is subconscious knowledge available while in control ?\nFeda. No, when you wish to recall what your conscious\nmind has lost you try to obtain it from the sub-\nconscious. Very often he tries to do this while\ncontrolling, but it is more difficult for him than\nfor you, because a smaller proportion of his mind\nis operating in the medium. In her brain there\nis some of her own mind, and also some of his ;\nwhile in your brain there is only your own mind.\nIn controlling it is, what may be termed, a co-\nojjerative mmd. You see therefore why he cannot,\nwhile controlling, think so clearly, or remember so\nmuch, as you can.\nFather controlling. December 9th, 1921.\n(During his controlling my father suddenly\nremarked :)\nSomething makes me want to cough.\n(The medium then coughed and cleared her\nthroat.)\nWhen I think suddenly it gives the organism a\njerk and I cannot control the breath properly\nuntil I cough.\n(Later he was checked in his attempt to explain\nsomething further, and proceeded :) I cannot make\nher say it, although I know quite well what it is\nI wish to tell you.\nEtta controlling. December 20th, 1921.\nYou remember how father described the con-\nscious and subconscious division of his mind. The\nconscious is the lesser, because the brain holds but\na small portion of the mind. When we passed\nover they both united. Now upon coming into\ncontrol that division resumes, because the mind has\nonce more to work through a finite body. We\ncontrol with the conscious, the subconscious is not\nwithin easy reach meanwhile. We bring in as\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 89\nmucli of our mind as we can, but the situation for\nus is something like having to turn from a full-\ncompass piano to perform for a time upon one\nhaving but a single octave of notes.\nFather controlling. January 6fh, 1922.\n(On coming to a dead stop in the midst of his\nremarks, he said :)\nI cannot remember. It is extraordinary. Some-\ntimes I cannot say the word required but now my\ndifficulty is that I cannot remember it.\nEtta controlling. March llth, 1922.\n(Etta had difficulty in remembering certain\ndetails, and I asked, \" Is the difficulty with you\nor the medium ? \")\nEtta. I know it now, this thing you want. It is as if my\nmind were in two parts, one part opening into the\nmedium's mind and the other shut off from her.\nSometimes I can let a thought from one part pass\ninto the other : at other times I am not aware,\nwhile here, that there is a second part. Father\nhas said that at some sittings he could not have\ngiven his name if you had asked him.\nC. D. T. Would practice obviate the difficulty ?\nEtta. I think that always some degree of difficulty must\nremain.\nC. D. T. Does Feda still feel that difficulty ?\nEtta. Yes, from many things she has told me. I gather\nthat she knows much more than she can get\nthrough.\nC. D. T. How does trance compare with other methods of\ncommunication ?\nEtta. We might be more limited in other ways. The\ntable might give one word containing a clue, but\nit is much more difficult through the table or\nother mechanical means, to remember things which\nare not mentally present in the sitter's mind also.\nBut at these sittings we find it easier to give what\nis not known to you or other sitters. But at a\ntable it is difficult to give what is not known to you.\n\f90 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\nNow, here, your remembering does not help me\nbecause I have another mind to work through,\nquite independently of yours. Here, your mind\ndoes not help me to remember. You know that\nwhat you have in your mind might even prevent\nus speaking of it. At a table there is no mind\nto prevent us getting a thing from you. It is\nvery much easier for us to get things from you\nwhen we are in your condition, than to remember\nthem for ourselves. We can reinforce our memories\nthrough yours. It is that which gives rise to a\nfeeling with some people that the table only reflects\nwhat one thinks. It is not really that, but results\nfrom its being easier to get that which the sitter\nat the table knows.\nC. D. T. You can give unknown things through the table ?\nEtta. Yes, but it is more difficult.\nEtta controlling. October 31st, 1924.\nC. D. T. Do you see by the medium's eyes now ?\nEtta. I see nothing.\nC. D. T. Like being in the dark ?\nEtta. Yes, but occasionally in the midst of the darkness\nI have seen Father, who has made some sign to\nme, but only occasionally. I cannot see you at\nall now. I think I am not quite in one condition\nor the other.\nC. D. T. Teda has alluded to using the medium's sense of sight.\nEtta. I think it may be done, but not to order.\nC. D. T. Have you no sight as a rule when controlling ?\nEtta. Just SO. I think that if I try to exercise the sense\nof sight or soimd I might lose control.\nC. D. T. But you hear me ?\nEtta. Yes, but I mean if I were to use my sense to hear\nFather. To hear you I use the medium's sense\nof sound, not my own. Should I use my own I\nshould immediately think myself into my own body\nagain completely, and so weaken my control.\nC. D. T. Is your body more or less over the medium's ?\nEtta. Yes, just merging into hers.\n\f107] The Modus Opei'ancli of Trance Communication. 91\nEtta controlling.\n1. March 19th, 1926.\n(Etta was endeavouring to give me a message\nwhich had been entrusted to her.)\nEtta. I knew it and felt sure of it, and now it is gone\nfrom me. I wish it would come back. It is\nextraordinary. You would not believe one could\nlose a thought like this.\nC. D. T. Is it like forgetting one's dream ?\nEtta. Yes, it is ; because you do not experience dreams in\nthe body. Similarly I did not hear this message\nwhen in the body of the medium, a body which is\nnot mine at all.\n(c) Influence of the Sitter.\nThere are reasons for thinking that the sitter is a\nfactor making for success or failure. In taking notes for\nseveral first-time sitters I have been struck by the wide\ndifferences in result. I notice that a stolid unresponsive-\nness militates against success, much as it would check\nconversation in social life. Feda speaks of \" deaf and\ndumb \" sitters ! I have occasionally received good evi-\ndence from a communicator who was a stranger to me,\nyet later, when his friends came to share my sitting, the\nevidence given was inferior. Such instances indicate that\ndifferences of result may not depend entirely upon the\ncommunicator and medium.\nBesides the influence of manner and mental attitude,\nI think we have to reckon with a psychical difference in\nsitters. The presence of certain people seems more or less\nto inhibit communication.\nI may also allude to the use and abuse of questions.\nThere is good reason for believing that indiscreet ques-\ntioning, or the ardent desire for some particular name or\nsubject, interferes seriously with the requisite mental\ncondition of a sitting.\nEtta controlling. January IQth, 1923.\nIt is difficult to explain, but the expectation by you\nof some particular thing seems to impinge on some\n\f92 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\nvery delicate thought-fabric which we are weaving,\nand spoils it, so that we cannot gather together\nits threads in order. They become knotted up.\nSo the advice is, go on keeping passive, and do\nnot thinly of any particular person or thing ; that\nwill prevent your thought impinging on ours.\nEverything to do with our thought is much more\ndelicate and subtle than yours, therefore our\nthought should impinge on yours and not vice\nversa. Father says that it would not be wise to\nrub canvas upon the paints, it has to be done the\nother way round.\nAbout difificulties in communication ;\npeople forget\nthat it is not their plane where all this takes place.\nThe difficulty is in speaking from one plane to\nanother. We can pour down our own material far\nmore easily than we can pour down the particular\nmaterial you may wish for. If we wish and think\nof it first, it does not matter about your wishing,\nbut if you wish and question before we have\nprepared the mould, it is very difficult for us,\nbecause we have already prepared a different\nmould. The book and newspaper tests were com-\nparatively easy to give because you could not\nmentally influence what we were transmitting.\nThe thmgs we give voluntarily are usually the best.\nWe Imow what . we can give, but when asked to\nsupplement it, in response to questions, we have to\nconform to your conditions. It is like having to\npour our thoughts into moulds which you prepare\nand which are not our moulds. It is difficult to\nexplain but, as a rule, it is best that you should\ntake what we can give. As you are aware, we\ncan often tell you things far more difficult than\nthose which you ask. In using the term \" moulds \"\nI mean a form of words and selection of thoughts.\nEtta through Feda. December 1th, 1923.\nFather controlling. Febricary 1st, 1924.\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Commimication. 93\nSome friends of mine had occasionally taken their\ndaughter Joyce to share their sittings with Mrs. Leonard.\nMy sister Etta was interested in Joyce's approaching\nmarriage and had referred to her in a recent sitting.\nOne day (April 11th, 1924), while on my way to Mrs.\nLeonard's house in Hertfordshire, I saw Joyce in the train\nand travelled with her. The incident then passed out of\nmy thought until Etta, during Feda's control, made a\nvery definite statement that I had just seen someone in\nwhom both she and I were interested. She proceeded to\nelaborate until there needed only the addition of the name\nJoyce to complete the evidence of her knowledge of our\nmeeting that morning. I therefore pressed for the name,\nand when Etta said that this was beyond her power, I\nenquired where the difficulty lay. \" Partly in you and\npartly in Feda,\" she answered. \" Then if I thought of\nsomething else, say the moon,\" I asked, \" would it make\na better chance of your giving the name ?\n\" Etta said,\n\" Do so, and I'll try later on to give it.\" So I put it\nfrom my mind, and waited to write notes of whatever\nmight come next ; and these words were then slowly\nspoken : \" \/ hope it will help Joyce.\"\nFather controlling. April llth, 1924.\nIt is easier for us to read your miad when away\nfrom here than it would be dm-ing a sitting. It\nis supposed by some that a medium reads the\nmind of a sitter ; but one has only to experiment\nto discover how difficult it is for us to answer\nquestions. We can sail along giving details quite\nunknown to you ; but if you suddenly ask a\nsimple question which comes into your mind, it\n. presents a difficulty to us. Now if we were read-\ning your mind there would not be that difficulty.\nDuring a sitting we are bent on keepuig intact\nthe link between ourselves and the control ; but\nif we lost it through giving too much attention to\nyou, it would be difficult to regain. It is as a\nthread which will stretch a little, but if taken\nround you as well as the medium it would break.\n\f94 C. Drayton Thomas. [PABT\nA question often breaks the thread of our thought\nand we have to drop the topic. We can often\ncreate another, and substitute it for the other\nquite quickly. We do not mind your asking ques-\ntions because we know that, if we do not take\nthem up, you will understand that there was a\nreason. But some sitters would feel distressed and\ndisappointed, which makes it hard for their com-\nmunicator. Our feeling of absolute ease with you\nmakes it possible for us to do our best. We know\nyou will not be distressed if we cannot do what\nyou ask at some particular moment.\nThrough Feda. February 20th. 1925.\nC. D. T. Feda, how do you distinguish between thoughts com-\ning from the communicator, and those in the\nsitter's mind ?\nFeda. It is a different feeling altogether, very different.\nI have trained myself to lean towards the com-\nmunicator and to shut off the sitter. I do not\nlike sitters to be in front of the medium, hut like\nto have the communicator in front. I concentrate\non just that place and so shut off other places.\nYour father says, \" Even that would not prevent\nFeda getting a thought and not knowmg it was\nfrom the sitter, if the latter happened to be willing\nsomething very strongly. A sitter might will his\nthought fifty times and miss, but Feda might\naccidentally take it the fifty-first time.\"\nC. D. T. And would not Feda realise from whom it came ?\nFather. Not unless she were very careful and on the watch\nfor interference.\n(Feda then confided to me an experience which\nrelated to a strong-minded lady, who held certain\nideas so firmly as to make it impossible for her\nhusband, who was communicating, to state the con-\ntrary. He ceased communicating to save un-\navoidable misunderstandings.\nShe continued :)\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 95\nFedA. Feda is careful not to start with the sitter's thoughts.\nFeda thinks she would know if a sitter's thoughts\ncame in, but your father says, \" That is not\ninfallibly so, especially if the sitter has a strong\nway of forcing thought.\"\nFather controlling. April \\4:th, 1927.\nWe never know when coming here that our prepared\nmaterial will be available. Some of the best we\nhave given had not been prepared. Conversation\nwith us may fit in and give ground upon which\nwe can base what we can give. Those whom Feda\nterms \" deaf and dumb sitters \" are unlikely to\nprovide good groundwork. Sitters should talk with\nus in an ordinary manner without giving away\ninformation. Such talk helps us. When first I\ncame here I used to give plentiful evidence of\nidentity, you did not give things away, but you\nuse to talk of the pleasure it gave you and so on.\n{d) Miscellaneous.\nThe following passages are of interest although not\nfalling into any of the foregoing divisions of the subject.\nJanuary 20th, 1921.\nFbda. Your Father says they have difficulty in remembering\nwhen in the mental condition, what they have said\nwhen in the physical condition, and vice versa.\nThat accounts for what happens, when at direct\nvoice sittings he tries to say something which he\nhad said here in his mental condition. You have\nnoticed he can scarcely give any indication of it.\nTrance-speakmg necessitates mental condition, a\ndirect voice sitting needs a physical condition.\nTherefore one will not get the same quality of\ncommunication at both. It is so difficult to carry\nthrough from one condition to another which is\ndifferent.\nThis is a suitable place in which to mention a remark-\nable physical phenomenon which is occasionally noticed\n\f96 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\nmomentarily during a Leonard sitting. I can only term\nit \" the direct voice,\" because it exactly resembles the\nvocalisation heard in direct-voice sittings with mediums\nwho specialise in that phenomenon. At such sittings the\nvoices are sometimes heard at a considerable distance from\nthe medium and do not (as has been repeatedly demon-\nstrated by the use of apparatus) issue directly from the\nmedium's lips. The manner in which those voices are\nproduced is still a matter about which little is known.\nNow there are times in Mrs. Leonard's sittings when\nthe communicator, while transmitting messages through\nFeda, will sviddenly speak a few words in the direct voice.\nI have frequently heard my father do this. Many of\nIMrs. Leonard's sitters have noticed the same thing. My\nfather tells me that it seems to him that the speaking of\na few words in this manner is made possible by the\nemanation being, for a brief interval, sufficiently dense to\nform a covering for the vocal organs of his etheric body.\nHe adds that he is not able to produce this direct voice\nat will, but only under very favourable conditions; be-\ncause this emanation with Mrs. Leonard is much less\nconcentrated than that which is present in direct-voice\nsittings. This explanation bears no resemblance to the\ntentative hypothesis by which I had been inclined to\nexplain direct-voice phenomena. But it is interesting as\nsuggesting a close relation between the emanation at\ntrance sittings and that which makes possible the various\npsychical phenomena usually termed physical.\nIn the above quotation we seem to have an explana-\ntion of the fact, so frequently noticed, that it is rare to\nget good mental phenomena during sittmgs where there\nare several physical phenomena. There are exceptions,\nespecially with powerful mediums, but it is the rule that\nevidential messages are scarce in those direct-voice sittings\nwhere lights and levitations are plentiful.\nFather through Feda. October 21th, 1922.\nEtta has been doing a good deal of work in con-\njunction with a band who are helping circles, and\nalso independent would-be mediums, to free them-\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 97\nselves from what we can only call \" imaginary\ncontrols and guides \" and to find out their real\nguides. Etta has foimd out that many such\nguides have to masquerade under other names\nthan their own because the mediums have made\nup their minds that such-and-such a name must\nbe the one. Many work under the assumed name\nrather than lose opportunity of working at all.\nThat is especially the case when famous names are\ngiven and the individuality at the back shows very\nlittle of the knowledge which would be possessed\nby those supposed to be controlling.\nFathsb. When I talk easily I notice it is in the forehead of\nthe medium, not in the brain, but just above the\neyes in front. When I lose sense of being just\nthere, I find it is not so easy to express myself.\nC. D. T. Do you try different places ?\nFather. I would not call it that. I might try in a way but\nfind myseK drawn to different parts of the head.\nTo-day I feel I am just here. (Hand touches\nabove the root of the nose, and above the eyes.)\nC. D. T. Do you mean at the root of the nose ?\nFather. That or higher. It seems a sensitive spot.\n(Reference to lavender in room.) Feda can smell it\nthrough the medium's nose, and Etta can smell it\nalso, although not controlling. Etta says that she\nmight not be able to smell lavender if you and\nthe medium were not present. (The perfume was\nquite perceptible in the room, a bunch of lavender\nhaving been placed on the piano.)\nA Minister slightly known to me was brought to one\nof my sittings not long after his passing. My father,\nwho had known him well, was said to have invited him\nto attend. The remarks by this visitor upon the new\nlife were highly interesting. Presently he alluded to the\nsitting.\nFather controlling. September Uth, 1923.\nFeda controlling. August 22nd, 1924.\n\f98 C. Drayton Thomas. [PAJBT\nThrough Feda. March 6th, 1925.\nYour father is now doing his best to make me\nfamUiar with this condition which I will term the\nbetween-state. I see quite clearly at this moment\nthat we are in, what I would like to call, a\nbetween-state. We are not, strictly speaking, on\neither bank, but on a bridge, a bridge which is\nmore of your making than ours. Not that we do\nnot wish to make it, but, unfortunately, in many\nways, the bridge must be built from your side.\nI think that, as you buUd, and as your side of\nthe bridge reaches closer to our bank, our thoughts\nhelp you considerably, but the material is yours,\nI see that now.\nEtta says, I feel extraordinarily close to you to-day,\nperhaps because of the day ;\n^ I remember previous\nsittings close to the day, yet think I never felt\nso near to you as yesterday and now.\nWe have to be rather careful at sittings not to\nfeel too near. I will explain. Sometimes when\nwe come to a sitting we feel so conscious of joy\nin the contact, such a sense of personal joy and\npleasure, that we don't always do as well in the\nsitting if we yield to it. Because we are inwardly\nregistering sometimes when we should exteriorise\nand send out to you, making ourselves known to\nyou exteriorly.\n(I don't understand that, Mrs. Etta, said Feda.)\nYou know how inarticulate on earth a keen\nrealisation makes one ; so with us when in a\nsitting sometimes. So we find it best to keep to\nbusiness, to express ourselves to you ; then after\nthe sitting we can be hajjpy, rather than revel in\nfeelings during the sitting itself. Self-control is\nneeded. In some people's sittings with personal\ncontrol there is much emotion manifested and\nnothing else.\n1 It was the anniversary of her death in 1920.\nThrough Feda. April 1st, 1927.\n\f107] The Modus Operandi of Trance Communication. 99\nThrough Feda. April Uth, 1927.\nFedA. It is SO difficult to carry through their thoughts\nIrom one condition to a different condition.\nC. D. T. Can you explain the difference between those two\nconditions ?\nFather. You know the conditions here. Should I wish to\nmaterialise for a voice sitting I use a material,\none more of your earth than of my own plane,\na physical substance. Should I materialise a hand\nto touch you with, I use a physical substance, a\nforeign condition, another life for the time being.\nI must identify myself with the quality and\ncondition of the material, make myself part of it.\nIt is not my own material, probably the medium's,\nwhoever's mentality is the controUmg one, and may\nbecome\u2014or I may have to make it become\u2014a part\nof myself, or I of it, pro tern. If conditions are\nexcellent I can use my own mentality to a great\nextent. Yet even then submerging it to a certain\nextent to suit the quality of the material.\nWhen conditions are bad, despite the power there,\nthen my mentality may be much overweighted by\nsome one else's mentality. And I should have to\nconform to the habits, quaUties, limitations of that\nmentality. Are there not records of educated men\nspeaking imgrammaticaUy in physical sittings ? Or\nspeaking with a foreign accent according to the\nmentality overshadowing ? We know it is so.\nOften in physical sittings we have had to identify\nourselves with, not only a physical condition and\nphysical material, but also to be submerged in\nothers' mentaUties.\nTo a slight extent we feel this in trance sittings.\nWe do not use the coarse substance here, but the\nmental. To borrow their physical substance one\nhas to borrow also their mentality, it is almost\nimpossible to disentangle the two.\n(Feda here teUs of a medium who thought the\nsitter's brother would have brown eyes like the\nsitter. That led to their being described as\n\f100 C. Drayton Thomas. [part\nbrown, whereas they should have been called blue.\nConsequently the sitter was upset.)\nFeda. Your father says, We have to conform to the men-\ntality of the medium in every kind of sittiag.\nShe is a between-condition.\nTo bring memory from a physical sitting to a\nmental one is difficult. For we have been too\nmuch submerged to remember afterwards what we\ndid. It is difficult to bring thoughts from a\nmental to a physical sitting ; we can remember aU\nwe require of the mental sitting, yet at the physical\nsitting the submerging process throws it out again,\nand then we have to give whatever is suggested to\nus, what we can recall in that condition.\nAlthough this paper does not touch upon every pheno-\nmenon of trance communication, I hope it may at least\nserve as a contribution towards a working hypothesis of\nthe type of sitting usually obtained with Mrs. Osborne\nLeonard.\nI conclude with my sister's remarks on the general\nsubject\n:\nThrough Feda. November 14th, 1924.\nEtta says that it seems to her that no one yet\nunderstands the unique character of a sitting. . . .\nIt is a no-man's-land between the two conditions,\nyours and ours. It is considered that communica-\ntion concerns earth people and spirit people,\nwhereas there is also the peculiar bridgeway which\nhas to be used and which belongs neither to one\nnor to the other, yet has some of the character-\nistics of each. Here lies all the difficulty. Medium\nand sitter are in part working in a condition which\nis not entirely theirs, and we work in one which\nis not entirely om\"s. It is a pooling of resotu-ces\nwhich creates the bridge. One gets out of one's\ndepth sometimes on both sides.\n\f107] Review. 101\nREVIEW.\nProblems in Psycho-Pathology. By T. W. Mitchell.\nThe title of this volume is not weU chosen, but that is\nperhaps the only fault to be found in this excellent little book.\nFor the book is a very clear and simplified exposition of the\npsychology of Prof. Sigmund Freud, for the general reader the\nbest of all the many that have appeared. But though as an\nexposition of this very difficult and complicated doctrine for\nthe layman the work is of a very high order, those who\nesteem Dr. Mitchell as an original thinker and an independent\ninvestigator in the field of abnormal psychology wUl regret that\nhe has not thought fit to give play to his critical faculty in\nthis volume. Such a reader asks himself at many points\n\u2014\nDoes Dr. Mitchell accept^ and endorse all this, as established\ntruth, as working hypothesis, or as interesting and stimulating\nspeculation ? And in the end he is left wondering whether\nDr Mitchell must now be reckoned among those who have\nfallen under the magic spell of Freud and have become un-\ncritical disciples of that great pioneer. It may be hoped that\nthis is not the case and that Dr. Mitchell wiU follow up the\npresent volume with another addressed to a more professional\ncircle, in which he will imdertake the task of examining in\nan impartial spirit the more serious of the criticisms that have\nbeen directed against the Freudian system. None of those\nwho have become whole-hearted disciples of Freud seems capable\nof undertaking a reasoned reply to criticisms, even in the role\nof declared advocates of the system. They seem to be too\nimpatient, if not contemptuous, of all criticism. Yet if, as they\nbelieve, the Freudian psychology is fundamentally sotmd, it\nmust be capable of withstanding, of rebutting, and even of\nf)rofittng by honest criticism. The meeting of such criticism\nin the open, in the scientific rather than in the sectarian spirit,\nis much needed. For lack of it there is danger that the\nFreudian system, which, as some of us believe, is an intimate\nblend of important truth and serious error, may long remain\napart, detached from the main stream of scientific advance, in\na position comparable to that of various metaphysical and\nesoteric doctrines, accepted by a select band, but without\nserious influence upon the main stream of thought of our\nwestern civilization.

For the Malagasy inhabit an\nisland, the third largest in the world, which, though in\nthe tropical zone, possesses, by reason of its separation\nfrom the mainland of Africa by the deep Mozambique\nChannel and because of its mountainous character, a climate\nthat is only semi-tropical. This climate, together with the\nheavy rainfall, tends to make fever endemic. But this\nis largely compensated by one of the most luxuriant\nvegetations of the globe. Tropical forests cover the\nnorthern half of the island and line the whole coast ;\nwide savannas sweep over the southern plateaux ;\nthough\ncereals are restricted in their distribution, cotton and hemp,\npotatoes, rice and sugar-cane, coffee and tobacco, grow\nabundantly ; and palms, orchids, acacias and baobabs, the\ncoco-nut, the orange and the mulberry are characteristic\n1 This paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society on June 6,\n1928.\n2 \" A Paradox : Proving the Inhabitants of the Ifland, called Mada-\ngajcar, or St. Laurence (in Things temporal) to be the happiest People\nin the World,\" The Harleian Mijcellany (London 1744), i. 256.\no\n\f210 Theodore Besterman [PABT\nof this vegetation. In its fauna Madagascar is equally\nhappy, possessing none of the larger quadrupeds, and\nhaving a large civet, the cryptoprocta ferox, as practically\nits sole representative of the ferocious carnivores ; the\navi-fauna is very rich ; and although crocodiles are un-\nfortunately very numerous, the country has no deadly\nserpent. All these advantages have joined to make the\nnatives of Madagascar a kind, friendly, extremely hospit-\nable, freedom-loving people. Their culture has unpleasant\naspects no doubt, such as the poison-ordeals (now for-\nbidden), the savage punishments meted out by native\njustice for seemingly trivial offences, and the repugnant\ncustoms associated with Betsileo burials ; but these\npractices cannot be judged apart from their premisses\nin native ideology, to which they appear right and\nseemly.\nEthnologically, the Malagasy are a very interesting\npeople. Although they comprise a possibly aboriginal\nstock, by far the largest part of the population of three\nmillions consists of Malayo-Indonesian, Melanesian and\nAfrican, with a smaller proportion of Arab and Indian,\ndescendants. Nevertheless, what is practically only one\nlanguage is spoken, and the customs and beliefs in the\nseveral parts of the island present no fundamental varia-\ntions.\nAlthovigh the religion of the Malagasy is comparatively\nsimple it would take us too far afield to consider it to\nany greater extent than is necessary for an understanding\nof what follows. They believe in a supreme god, the\n\" creator of all things,\" Zanahary, who is incapable of\nevil. The natives naturally interpret evil as that which is\ncontrary to their own welfare, and Zanahary, being thus\nunable to harm them, is a somewhat otiose divinity,\nneglected and even regarded, by the bolder spirits, with\na little quiet contempt. There are no priests, since there are\nno temples, but the sorcerers and diviners have great\npower. The method of divination chiefly used is a kind\nof geomancy, and this, in conjunction with an elaborate\nsystem of taboo (here called fady) governs the native's\nlife. They have very elaborate burial customs and beliefs\n\f109] Madagascar\u2014Evocatiofi of the Dead, etc. ' 211\nconnected with death,^ chief among which is the belief\nthat they can ,\nget into communication with the spirits of\nthe dead, by whose advice they can, amongst other things,\ncure disease and foretell the future.^ It would be no\nexaggeration, indeed, to say that the Malagasy look upon\nthe dead as continuously, though invisibly, present among\n1 These customs and beliefs have an important bearing on our subject,\nbut as space forbids a close consideration of them, I merely append a\nlist of the more important discussions of tliis subject : Ch.

This sentiment is expressed with picturesque\nforce in one of their proverbial sayings :\n\" The guinea-\nfowl when flying departs not from the wood, nor, when\nhiding, from the earth, and the fandro shrub dies on the\nground. All the hairs of the head cannot bind death,\nand tears cannot hold him ; therefore give up the dead,\nfor the earth is the forsaking-place of the beloved ones,\nthe dwelling of the living, the home when dead.\"i This\nbelief must be borne in mind in considering what follows,\nfor it is chiefly responsible for the intensity of the\nMalagasy ancestor-worship. The mere worship of ancestors,\nas found in many parts of the world, often plays a com-\nparatively unimportant part in the life of the community.\nBut when this worship is found, as in Madagascar, in\nconnection (whether causally or not) with a profound\nbelief in the omnipresence of the ancestors, its influence\non the individual and on the community may readily be\nimagined. One has only to suppose what sort of com-\nplexion English civilisation would bear if every inhabitant\nof the Islands were an ardent spiritualist, convinced that\nhe could get into communication with the spirits of, say,\nhis dead parents, by the simple process of visiting a\nmedium, and if at the same time the religion of the country\nwere a worship of those same ancestors !\nBut not only do the Malagasy believe in the as-it-were\nspiritual omnipresence of the dead, and not only do they\nhold it as an article of faith that they can communicate\nwith them through appropriately gifted individuals, they\nalso tell stories of ghostly apparitions visible to the gener-\nality of the people. \" In 1906,\" a missionary, but an\naccurate and conscientious observer, tells us, \" a whole\nregion east of Antananarivo was greatly moved, because,\none evening, a man, celebrated in the land, but dead for\nsome ten years, was seen by the window of a hut of which\nhe had been the proprietor. The details were given with\nprecision, the day and time were indicated, and the\nwitnesses cited. The same writer also records a case in\n1 James Sibree, \" The Oratory, Songs, Legends, and Folk-Tales of the\nMalagasy,\" The Folk-Lore Journal (London 1883), i. 12.\n^ H. Rusillon, Un culte dynastique (Paris 1912), p. 50.\n\f109] Madagascar\u2014Evocation of the Decul, etc. 213\nwhich a young woman, twenty-four hours after her supposed\ndeath, returned to give various messages to her family and\nneighbours and to indicate the exact day and time of her\ndefinitive death, which took place as foretold. But this\ntime our informant sceptically puts the facts down to an\nepidemic of chronic paludism then raging, during which\npeople were buried while in a state of insensibility char-\nacteristic of the disease.^\nNor, we are told, are these two incidents isolated, \" for\nin the evening, around the fire, what extraordinary ghost\nstories are to be heard ! And even more would be heard\nif the people dared to speak quite freely in the presence\nof a missionary. One individual comes to tell you quietly\nthat he had a visit from a dead person during the night.\nA husband talked at length to his wife. She left him\ninstructions for his conduct . . .\n\" ^ And so on. The same\nmissionary quotes a letter, that came into his hands by\nchance, from one native to another. It appears that a\nman of Ambatolampy, a village in the district of Isoa-\nvimbazaha, who died ten years before, being displeased\nwith the behaviour of his descendants, decided to reveal\nhimself to them. He began to throw stones at them, nor\ncould they see whence they came. Then he started\nbreaking the pots and pans. He tired of this also and\nbegan to whistle. At last his children cried out, \" If\nyou have something good to tell us, say it, but stop\nfrightening us.\" This went on for some time, and he con-\ntinued by removing the slates and breaking the thread when\nweaving was going on. Eventually his voice began to be\nheard ; he made his complaints, expounded the ten com-\nmandments, and requested that place should be made for\nhim at table. The food disappeared, but no one saw\nhim eat, though the sound of his jaws was heard. The\nstory got round and on the 7th of August 1909, 400 persons,\nincluding the elite of the neighbourhood, such as the\ngovernor, the midwife, teachers and evangelists, assembled\non the spot saying it was all lies. They went into the\nhouse, and, in order to see more clearly, they made a\nfire, when suddenly a voice was heard saying, \" Even if\n'^Ihid., pp. 49-50. ^ Ibid., p. 50.\n\f214 Theodore Besterman .

And what opportunities\nfor a Madagascar S.P.R. !\nII.\n1 am not, of course, concerned in this paper with these\nbeliefs as such, but rather v\/ith their manifestations in\naction, and with any light such action may throw on a\npossibly veridical basis of these beliefs. I do not propose,\ntherefore, to give any more detailed account of the\nMalagasy doctrine of the evocation of the dead, but\nproceed to an account of the recurrent as-it-were spiritual-\nistic epidemics to which this doctrine has led.\nThe modern history of Madagascar dates from the reign\nof the enlightened and progi'essive Radama I., who ruled from\n1810 to 1828. On his death at an early age power was\nseized by one of his wives, who became Ranavolana I.,\nand during whose reign of thirty-three years active re-\naction was encouraged. On the ascent to the throne in\n1861 of Radama II. the country had almost relapsed into\ncomplete barbarism, and the new king, although he had\nthe will, lacked the character to undo the evil done by\nhis predecessor. Now followed the events to be noted.\nMy account is based, for the sake of accuracy and impar-\ntiality, on the narratives of four ej^e-witnesses of the most\nvaried points of view : Dr. Andrew Davidson, physician\nto the Court of Madagascar ;\n^ the Rev. William Ellis,\nchiefly known for his Polynesian researches, who had been\nsent out by the London Missionary Society to resume the\nmissionary work interrupted by Ranavolana I. for a\nquarter of century ;\n^ and Fathers Finaz and Boy, French\nmissionaries whose contemporary narratives were incor-\n^H.

The queen\nRanavolana I. was very annoyed at the tentative reforms\nRadama II. was beghinmg to introduce, and was con-\nsidering a personal visit to j)ut a stop to them. Radama I.,\non the contrary, was delighted that his own views were gain-\nmg the upper hand again, and did his best to restrain\nhis angry successor. The queen, however, had secretly\nmade her arrangements for departure, and in March of\nthe same year small parties began to arrive at the capital,\nsome actually carrying various articles, others imagining\nthemselves to be loaded with the dead queen's baggage.\nThey were accompanied by musicians, and danced almost\ncontuiuously. In a few weeks these groups had increased\nto hundreds, so that it was impossible to go out without\nmeeting some of them. \" It spread rapidly,\" writes\nDavidson (Zoc. cit., p. 131), \"as by a sort of infection,\neven to the most remote villages in the central province\nor Ivierina, so that, havmg occasion to visit a distant\npart of the country in company with an Englishman, we\nfound even in remote hamlets, and, more wonderful still,\nnear solitary cottages, the sound of music, indicating that\nthe mania had sj^read even there.\"\nThose affected were chiefly of the lower class, and\nwomen between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five.\nThey were called, as was the epidemic itself, ramanenjana,\nmeaning \" that which makes tense (or stifi^),\" from one of\nthe symptoms felt by the persons afflicted.

Most histories of Madagascar have some account of the\nramanenjana, most of them inaccurate, and nearly all derived from one or\nother of the above-mentioned sources.\n\f216 Theodore Besterrnan [PAET\ntoms are most fully described by Davidson {loc. cit.,\npp. 132-133). \" The patients usually complained of a\nweight or pain in the praecordia [the region about the\nheart], and great uneasiness, sometimes a stiffness about\nthe nape of the neck. Others, in addition, had pains in\nthe back and limbs, and in most cases there seems to\nhave been an excited state of the circulation, and occasion-\nally even mild febrile symptoms. One or more of these\npremonitory symptoms were frequently observed : there\nwere numerous cases where they were absent. After\ncomjjlaining, it may be one, two, or three days, they\nbecame restless and nervous, and if excited in any way,\nmore especially if they haj^pened to hear the sound of\nmusic or singing, they got perfectly uncontrollable, and,\nbursting away from all restraint, escaped from their\npursuers, and joined the music, when they danced some-\ntimes for hours on end with amazing rapidity. They\nmoved the head from side to side with a monotonous\nmotion, and the hands, in the same way, alternately up\nand down. The dancers never joined in the singing, but\nuttered frequently a deep sighing sound. The eyes were\nwild and the whole countenance assumed an indescribable,\nabstracted expression, as if their attention was completely\ntaken off what was going on around them. The dancing\nwas regulated very much by the music, which was always\nthe quickest possible\u2014it never seemed to be quick enough.\nIt often became more of a leaping than a dancing. They\nthus danced to the astonishment of all, as if possessed by\nsome evil spirit, and, with almost superhuman endurance,\nexhausting the patience of the musicians, who often\nrelieved each other by turns, then [that is, the dancers]\nfell down suddenly, as if dead ;\nor, as often happened, if\nthe music was interrupted, they would suddenly rush off\nas if seized by some new impulse, and continue running\nuntil they fell down almost, or entirely, insensible. After\nbeing completely exhausted in this way, the patients were\ntaken home, the morbid impulse apparently in many\ncases destroyed. Sometimes the disease, thus stopped,\nnever recurred ; but more frequently there was a return.\nThe sight of dancers, or the sound of music, even in the\n\f109] Madagascar\u2014Evocation of the Dead, etc. 217\ndistance, or anything which, by association, seemed con-\nnected with the disease, determined a recurrence of the fit.\n\" The patients were fond of carrying about with them sugar-\ncanes. They held them in their hands, or carried them\nover the shoulder while they danced. Frequently, too,\nthey might be seen going through their singular evolu-\ntions with a bottle of water upon their heads, which they\nsucceeded wonderfully in balancing. The drum was the\nfavourite instrument, but others were used, and all were\nacceptable. When there were no musical instruments to\nbe had, the attendants beat time with their hands, or sung\na tune which was a favourite amongst the Ramanenjana.\"\nIt is clear that these dancers were simply mediums of the\nshamanistic tj^e, and it is indeed recorded, even by our\nauthorities, the medical man and the missionaries of a\nnot very enlightened type, that they professed to be in\ncommunication with the dead, and particularly, of course,\nwith Ranavolana I. The dancers also seemed to lose, to\na large extent, consciousness of their bodies, or felt,\naccording to their own expression, as if a dead body\nwere tied to them.\nThis epidemic concluded in an insurrection and the murder\nof Radama II. It broke out again in the following year,\nbut Rasoherina, Radama II. 's widow, who succeeded him,\nfearing that it might again lead to political complications,\nput the epidemic down with a strong hand. But there\nare records of its recurrence in, for instance, 1873,^ 1895,^\n1906 or 1907,3 and 1910,* and no doubt other outbreaks\noccurred before and since, and, in one or other of its forms,\nthe ramanenjana is continuously in manifestation.''\nFor in addition to the manifestations of these spirituaHstic\n1 E.g., Raoul Allier, La Psychologie de la conversion chez les penples non-\ncivilises (Paris 1925), i. 364.\n2 W.

Pechin, loc. cit.), the salamanga (for which see, e.g..\n\f218 Theodore Besterman [part\nphenomena as widespread epidemics, they also appear, on\na much smaller scale, locally. And it is of these local\nphenomena that we have the most detailed information,\nin two papers by Parisot {loc. cit.) and Pechin {loc. cit.)\nand particularly in an important book by M. Henry\nRusillon, an experienced and enlightened missionary.^\nIII.\nWe must now proceed to a more detailed considera-\ntion of the ceremony of evocation of the dead in one of\nthese local manifestations. After preliminary ceremonies\nfor the purpose of purifying the sorcerer and for finding a\nsuitable subject, the proceedings began with the burning\nof incense, the playing of music, and much dancing\nround the person chosen as the vessel into which the\nancestor is asked to enter. The choice is usually made,\nit appears, of a person who is ill, and who thus hopes to\nbe cured. Indeed, the title given to the man who pre-\nsides over the ceremony (fiketrahana) should, we are told,\nbe strictly translated as \" healer \" rather than \" sorcerer,\"\nas is customary.^\nOften the subject, whom for clarity I will call the\nmedium, at once goes into trance, or into some kindred\nabnormal state of consciousness. Sometimes, however, it is\nnecessary to use a circular mirror, apparently bearing white\nlines, on which the medium is requested to fix his eyes.^\nJames Sibree, The Great African Island [London 1880], pp. 295-296),\nand the tromba (for wliich see below), are different phases of the same\nphenomenon. M. AlHer, indeed, gives as tlie full name of tliis mani-\nfestation a phrase which includes two of the above terms, {loc. cit.,\ni. 363). On the other hand, M. G. Mondain (quoted by R. Allier,\nIntroduction to H. Russillon, Un culte dynastique [Paris 1912], p.\n17n.) states that some Malagasy use the several words in different\nsenses. The information at our disposal is insufficient to permit scien-\ntific discrimination between them, and even the distinction made in\nthe text is purelj'' tentative and open to correction.\n^ Henry Russillon, Un mite dynastique avec evocation des morts chez\nles Salcalaves de Madagascar : Le \" Tromba \" (Paris 1912).

Pechin, op. cit., p. 178.\n\f109] Madagascar\u2014Evocation of the Dead, etc. 219\nBeing thus seemingly hypnotised, the medium begins\nto shout, and henceforth he is treated in accordance\nwith his new personahty. In other words, he is now\nsupposed to be possessed by an ancestor. (It may be\nnoted, parenthetically, that at the same moment, one,\ntwo, three, sometimes many, of those present are taken\npossession of. The ancestors, say the natives, follow the\nexamjDle of one of their number.) The name of the\npossessing ancestor is as yet unknown, and the assembly\ndisperses, discussing his identity and the hoped-for mani-\nfestations at the next stage of the whole ceremony, for\nnow the second stage has ended, the purifications and the\nlike having formed the first stage.\nThe opening of the third stage (or seance, as our\nauthority calls it) is similar, except that now the medium\ngoes more readily into trance. What characterises this\nstage is that now the spirit begms to speak. But let it\nnot be supposed that the ancestor comes easily. No, it\nis just as with a European medium, where the sitter is\nfavoured with the conversation of a \" control,\" who\nconveys the messages of the communicating spirit, the\nlatter making his own voice audible only as a very\nspecial j)rivilege. So in Madagascar, the voice first heard\nis that of a servant, full of protests :\n\" What do you\nwant?\" \"The master is engaged,\" \"You are disturbing\nhim without cause,\" and so on. But those present, I\nmean in the body, can also j)rotest, and they protest\nviolently : it is the ancestor himself they want. The\nservant is cursed, and sent about his business to fetch\nhis master. In due course the latter comes, and names\nhimself. At once, the audience adjusts its behaviour. If\nthe jiossessing spirit is that of an ancestor known to have\nbeen opposed to Christianity, nothing is to be heard but\nimprecations against all Christians. If the temporarily\nreincarnated ancestor is Radama II. they become ardent\ndevotees of all things European ;\nthey love the whites ;\nthey even speak French :\n\" Koman 9a va ? gava bian !\n\"\nAlthough their French, in the example given, seems some-\nwhat elementary, M. Rusillon states categorically that on\nthese occasions genuine speaking with tongues or glossolalia\n\f220 Theodore Besterman [PAET\ntakes place.1 His explanation (pp. 138-140), if I under-\nstand it, is that the words thus spoken of an unknown\nlanguage or dialect are the automatic reproductions of\nsounds recorded in the subconsciousness while the subject\nwas in the presence of persons speaking that language.\n^\nThis seems to be the true normal interpretation, but\nM. Rusillon certainly gives the impression that the things\nsaid, by the medium, at any rate, go beyond the resources\nof a vocabulary acquired in so haphazard a manner.\nUnder the circumstances I can do no more than state the\nhypothesis and the difficulty.\nBut it is not enough for the spirit to name himself\n:\nhis relations must recognise him. It is greatly to be\nregretted that we are not told how the spirit compels\nthis recognition, but merely that the spirit's self-identifica-\ntion is questioned and must be agreed to before the affair\ncan lorogress. At last order is restored, and the assembly\ngets to work. For the spirit is also a healer, he indicates\nremedies, he performs cures, and, says our authority\n(pp. 171 et seq.), perfectly genuine cures, chiefly of the\nfevers which we have seen to be endemic. The spirit is\nbombarded with questions, for nothing is unknown to him.\nHe indicates what taboos are to be observed, what voyages\nshould be undertaken, how to become rich, and so on.\nThis concludes the third part of the ceremony, and the\nmedium comes to. He knows nothing of what has fallen\nfrom his own lips ;\nindeed, he takes beforehand the pre-\ncaution of entrusting to a friend the task of remembering,\nand of relating to him, what has taken place.\nThe fourth and last part of the proceedings consists\nchiefly of various sacrificial performances, into which I\nneed not enter, designed to complete the cure of the\nmedium himself. I say \" chiefly,\" for at the very end the\ncured medium goes into a voluntary, presumably a self-\n1 H. Rusillon, Un cidte dynastique, pp. 93, 127, 138. At p. 127, for\ninstance, he writes, \"Quant au Trombu [ = spirit], il parle la langue\nde son pays d'origine, sans s'inquieter de son '\nsiege.'\n\"\n^ The most recent writer on this subject (George Barton Cutten, Speak-\ning with Tongues [Newhaven 1927], pp. 178 et seq.) comes to the same con-\nclusion, though he does not refer to the savage cases.\n\f109] Madagascar\u2014Evocation of the Dead, etc. 221\ninduced, trance and the spirit demands his rewards. In\nresponse the medium is loaded with gifts, and amid\nhbations, cries and games, the proceedings come to an\nend with general intoxication, one feature, at least, that is\nnot reproduced in a European spiritualistic sitting.\nSuch is the great Malagasy ceremony of the evocation of\nthe dead, and it only remains to add that fraud, although it\nhas not been actually detected, is possible. A young\nHova, converted to Christianity, determined to investigate\nthis point. He went to such a ceremony as I have\ndescribed and pretended to go into trance and to become\npossessed by a spirit. He went through the performance\nusual in such cases, of answering questions \" out of his\nhead,\" to the complete satisfaction of the questioners.^\nThis gulMbility compels us to maintain a sceptical attitude\ntowards the alleged veridical nature of these phenomena.\nBut one cannot help feeling that the immensely long and\ntroublesome preliminaries a medium has to go through\nbefore being recognised as a channel through which sup-\nposed spirits of the ancestors are willing to manifest, put\ndeliberate fraud out of court as a general explanation of\nthe phenomena of mediumship among the easy-going\nMalagasy.\n^ H.

First I must name those Members\nof Coimcil who supported the experiment throughout,\nespecially Dr. Woolley, who was chief adviser, aider and\nabetter. Next I must mention Miss Newton, for it was\nthe facts observed during the long series of experiments\nin telepathy carried on by her which led me to undertake\nthe present experiments in clairvoyance. Then especial\nthanks are due to Dr. R. A. Fisher for devising the\nscoring system which was used throughout this experiment\nand which made it possible to arrange such a large\nnumber of different elements on a businessKke basis,\nand also for having many times flung me a hfe-hne\nwhen I was nearly submerged by the problems which\ntaxed my hmited arithmetic.\nNext come a group of names, Miss Wallace, Mr. O'Dell,\nMr. Summerson, and Mr. Soal, who collected, scored and\nanalysed a very large number of results at a time when\nI had, with what seemed Uke supreme cunning, fallen\nill the moment that the work was beginning in earnest.\nMr. Dingwall very kindly agreed to witness on seven-\nteen different occasions some of my own efforts at card-\nguessing. I felt it was most important to have some\nwitnessed experiments, and was glad to get an expert\n^ This paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society on June\n27th, 1928.\n\f224 Ina Jephson [PABT\nwitness who could detect at once any incipient leanings\ntowards fraud on my part.\nMiss Phillimore and the editor of Light most kindly\nhelped by publishing several appeals in the columns of\nLight which produced a considerable number of interesting\nreplies. I have also had help from Germany for which I\nam most grateful, Herr Studienrat Lambert in particular\nsending me a number of results ; Dr. Tischner, Dr. Luther,\nDr. Tartaruga also contributing and taking a most en-\ncouraging interest in the experiment. To Herr Leonhard\nI am indebted for scoring and analysing by Dr. Fisher's\nsystem 6000 pairs of cards, a labour which was essential\nto the value of the experiment, as it was of the first\nimportance to have chance data with which the results\nof guessing could be comj^ared. In America Dr. Walter\nPrince collected some results (printed below, p. 258),\nand subsequently sent me some of his own trials at\ncard-guessing which have been of great interest in corro-\nborating my own inferences and conclusions from this\nexperiment.\nFinally I must thank the 300 experimenters themselves\nwho tried their luck at card-guessing and recorded their\nresults. This 300 includes members of the Society, my\nown friends and victims outside the Society, a selection\nof those who joined with some success in Dr. Woolley's\nbroadcast telej)athy experiment, and a number of the\nreaders of Light. I think that the fact of the guessers\nhaving belonged to so many diiferent locaHties and circles\nadds considerably to its interest and to the value of the\ndata, and I hope that those who co-operated will feel\nrewarded to some extent by the interesting nature of\nthe results.\nI should like to have called this experiment an experi-\nment in card-divining, only unfortunately card-divining\nsuggests usually that the diviner will prophesy a journey\nacross water or urge you to beware of the jealousy of a\ndark woman. I regret that these experiments will throw\nno very direct light on such hopes and problems. They\nwere designed in the hope of throwing light on the\nworking of the faculty of clairvo3^ance, scrying, dowsing or\n\f109] Evidence for Clairvoyance in Card-Guessing 225\nmetagnomy\u2014whichever word be preferred\u2014with playing\ncards as the objects of perception.\nThis card-guessing or card-divining has often of course\nbeen tried before, as the history of psychic research\nshows, and considerable if isolated successes have been\nobtained, but isolated successes, however impressive, do\nnot get the attention they deserve, being classified, quite\nnaturally, as mere coincidences.\nThe following experiment therefore is an attempt to\nshow that these sporadic successes may not always and\nonly be due to comcidence, but that they may also be\ndue to another factor commonly called \" clairvoyance \"\n;\nand we shall have evidence for this suggestion if the\nexperiment demonstrates that the successes are continued\nto a remarkable degree during a very large number of\ntrials. The net of coincidence may rightly include an\nalmost infinite number of successes, but there comes\na moment when, to common sense, that net is stretched\nto breaking point, and a fresh hypothesis must be sought\nto account for this persistent characteristic of success.\nThese records which I shall show do confirm in my view\nthe possibihty of this direct divination of objective facts\nwithout the use of our normal senses. They also confirm\nthe natural expectation, which I have already expressed,\nthat firstly, if such a, faculty exists at all it would be\nwidespread, and that we can experiment with it as we\ncan with our other senses ; and secondly, that it is bound\nat least by some of the known and recognised psycho-\nlogical habits and laws.\nI have been much interested in the course of the experi-\nment by the response given to this proposition, \" Do\nyou think it is possible (trickery apart) to knov\/ what a\nplaying card is without looking at it ?\n\" The answer\ndivides people into two distinct classes : one group is\nquite wiilmg to try, open-minded as to the possibility of\nsuccess ; the other group, more sceptical by nature, or\nforced by a scientific training into a wary watchfulness,\ndoes not even think experiment worth a trial. This\nsecond point of view was brought home to me very\nforcibly on one occasion.\np\n\f226 Ina Jephson [part\nI had been trying card-divining myself for some months,\nand had been greatly struck, almost alarmed, by the\nresults. They seemed so very much better than chance\nshould give. I met a doctor of my acquaintance who\npractised hypnotism and suggestion and who therefore,\nI hoped, might be open-minded as to the possibility of\nsuch a thing as clairvoyance. I admit I made my\nstatement with a httle nervousness as I had not then\nthe corroborative evidence I have now. On my telhng\nhim that I imagined I knew what a playing card was\nwithout looking at it, he gave me a piercing diagnostic\nglance and said \" that was very interesting ; \u2014had I any\nfriends in the country who would be wilhng to have\nme for a good long rest ?\n\" But on second thoughts he\neither did not think this hkely, or perhaps not quite\nfair on my friends, for he added, he knew a quiet httle\nplace in Cornwall where he sometimes sent his patients.\nWould I like the address ? He would be only too\npleased to give it me. I think his point of view\u2014the\nview I mean that siich a thing as divining a plajdng\ncard is an impossibihty\u2014is the most \" reasonable.\" His\nattitude stimulated me to try to give that reasonable\nview a shake. I felt that as it was the reasonable\nview it might be altered if the facts for the defence\ncould be presented clearly and reasonably, and that it\nmust be possible so to present these facts that they would\ncompel critical attention, and\u2014more important still\n\u2014\nthat it would be possible to put the problem on to an\nexperimental basis, so that the critics themselves might\nfind they got similar results had they the energy to try\nthe experiment and the opportimity to follow its method.\nI think it will help my readers to see how persuasive\nthe experiment has been to myself if I tell them the\nhistory of its development.\nThis research grew out of the many experiments in\ntelepathy carried out over a long period of time under\nMiss Newton's guidance. These experiments have been\nreported on in the Journal.^ They were undertaken, not\n1 A Report on ExiDeriments in Thought Transference, June 1927,\nvol. xxiv.\n\f109] Evidence for Clairvoyance in Card-Guessing 227\nso much to get evidence of telepathy as to try to find\nthe conditions in which it might best appear and work.\nI am afraid I must go over old ground for a while, but\nthe point I wish to make is an important one and the\nexplanation of our experiments may be a help to those to\nwhom the subject is new.\nMany of these experiments were as follows : one person\ncalled the agent looks at a diagram, or picture\npostcard, in the hope of transmitting its image to another\nperson called the percipient who with closed eyes and\nmind as empty as possible records such impressions as\nmay come to him.\nWe had enough, if fragmentary, success to impress me\ngreatly. We used to make notes of the frame of mind\nof the agent, and record his or her intensity of con-\ncentration or interest. But as time went on I became\nmore and more puzzled as to why we should always\nassume that the impression came from the agent's mind\nand not from the picture or card itself. Several small\nincidents seemed to point to this last conclusion. On one\nor two occasions I felt, when I was the receiver or per-\ncipient, that the impression of the chosen object came to me\nbefore the agent had looked at it, or else, as on one occasion\nwhen picture postcards were the objects chosen, that my\nimpression talhed with a neighbouring card unseen by\nthe agent, instead of the one at which the agent had\nbeen gazing. It was borne in on me with more and\nmore force that it was quite an unfounded assumption\nthat the agent was necessary at all. I think we are\nmuch too apt to put down to telepathy occurrences which\nare due to clanvoyance alone. I use the term telepathy\nin its ordinary sense, meaning the transmission of thought\nfrom one mind to another without the help of the normal\nsenses, and clairvoyance in its ordinary sense, meaning the\ndivination by one mind alone of some fact or facts with-\nout the aid of the normal senses. This problem of tele-\npathy versus clairvoyance has always seemed to me the\ncentral problem of psychic research, and these experi-\nments were devised very largely in the hope of emphasis-\ning how unnecessary is this hypothesis of \" telepathy,\"\n\f228 Ina Jejyhson [part\nand of throv\/ing some light on the problem as a\nwhole.\nWe had, of course, tried experiments sometimes with\nplaying cards, the agent looking at the card and attempt-\ning to transmit its image mentally to the percipient.\nI append the record of our first experiment, in June 1924,\nwhen we achieved ten colour successes running, and five\nsuit successes in all. Though these results are not above\nchance, they are worth noting, especially as similar colour\nand suit successes were obtained in later experiments.\nI give the series so that it may be compared to the\nsuccesses in clairvoyance. I assume for my present argu-\nment that though another person was looking at the\ncards, we may count these also as clairvoyant experiments.\nMiss Newton, Agent.\n10 Spades -\n1 Hearts -\nKing of Hearts\n4 Spades -\n2 Diamonds\n9 Spades -\n3 Spades -\n3 Diamonds\nQueen of Spades\n9 Hearts -\n5 Diamonds\n8 Clubs -\nMiss Jephson, Percipient.\n5 Clubs.\nRed court card.

My few spontaneous\nexperiences of that nature have been of a very average\ntype, and in experiment my successes have been\nmediocre. So from the first I hoped and expected that\nany successes I might obtain would be achieved equally\nand better by many other people, and this estimate is\n\f109] Evidence for Clairvoyance in Gard-Otiessing 229\nI think borne out by the subsequent ex^jeriments ; 33\npeople out of the 240 recorded getting scores of about\nthe same value and the same type of result as myself,\nand 13 being very definitely better.\nBut to return to \u2022\nthe history of the experiment. I\ngot out a pack of cards one night, in March 1924,\nand just before I was going to sleep tried my luck,\ndrawing a card from the pack and trying to guess or\ndivine what it was.

I was filled with hope and excitement and\ndetermined to try again. The next night on which I\ntried I again got one right out of five, and one nearly\nright.

The method of\nscoring, and curves y and z are explained later.\nThe significance of this I feel cannot be over-estimated,\nfor if this characteristic of early-success continued\nand was observable in the efforts of other people\nalso, it would be highly suggestive of some element\nother than chance at work. It would suggest in fact a\nfaculty which was liable to fatigue or confusion, or to\nsome deterrent element. A second and most valuable\nservice rendered by the detection of this early-guess\nsuccess is that it may be counted additional evidence of\nthe honesty of the experimenters should they, unknown\nto themselves, produce the same result. It also makes\nit possible for the investigator conducting the experiment\nto allow the maximum of freedom to his diviners, a con-\ndition which is essential to the working of the faculty and\ntherefore to the success of the experiment. It seems a most\nfortunate chance that this early-guess success should have\nshown up so clearly at the very beginning of the experiment.\nI continued guessing at odd moments and keeping a\ncareful record for over a year, getting persistently the\nsame effect of early successes (a diagram later (2) will\nshow the record of all the experiments I did of this\nconsecutive five guess type).\nAs time went on I became less and less successful,\nfinally getting results only equal to chance. This did not\naltogether depress me as I hoped it might be further\nevidence of the presence of a fatiguable faculty. At the\nend of some months, in April 1924, I asked Mr. Dingwall\nto witness a series of trials for me, as I was most anxious\nto see if the faculty worked when under observation.\nWe continued at intervals till July 1924, and both Mr.\nDingwall and I myself were so much disappointed at the\n\f109] Evidence for Clairvoyance in Card-Guessing 231\nextreme lowiiess of my score that we considered my\nefforts no better than what chance might have given, and\nX REPRESENTS 15 GUESSES ALONE.

My first victim I think, and the first person\nI asked, was Mr. Saltmarsh, a member of the Society,\nwho guessed five series of five consecutive guesses. I\nasked him rather hopefully as he had had success as\na water-diviner, and if he can divine water, why not\ncards, I thought optimistically. When he returned his\nresults, to my great delight he had started off well\nand deteriorated most pleasingly as he continued.

The\nproblem was put by Dr. Woolley to Dr. R. A. Fisher of\nthe Rothamsted Experimental Station, and he devised\nthe system which was adopted and used throughout this\nresearch. His full description of it is in Proc. S.P.R.\n^ The score is explained later.\n\f109] Evidence for Clairvoyance in Card-Guessing 233\nvol. xxxiv. p. 181, July 1924. I can only give a brief\noutline here and will quote from liis opening paragraph :\nThe problem of scoring a series of events so as to\nmeasure appropriately the degree of success attained in\neach trial seems to lie on the borderhne between the\npurely deductive region of mathematical probability and\nthe region of arbitrary choice. . . .\nIf two pliiying cards are obtained from different packs,\nthe maximum degree of success is clearly obtained if they\nare corresponding cards of the same suit [say 4 Heart with\n4 Hearts], but, short of this we shall have obtained some\ndegree of resemblance if the cards are either corresponding\ncards of different suits [4 Hearts and 4 Diamonds], or even\nif they are of the same colour. There are in fact nine\npossibilities or degrees of success to each of which we can\nassign an appropriate score.\nHaving settled these scoring values, Dr. Fisher then gives\na figure for the mean average score, and a standard\ndeviation from that score.\nIn this card-guessing experiment what we need to\nknow is when our scores become sufficiently good to be\nreasonably considered above what we might expect from\nchance, so that we may fairly deduce that some factor\nother than chance is at work. So after we know the\nmean deviation and mean average score we are given\nfurther calculations by which we can know when our\nscores are exceeding chance, or what we might expect from\nchance. The following table will show the nine different\nclasses of likeness which one card may have with another.\nCard. Guess.

The average score for a number\nof guesses would be expected to deviate from 11-18 by\nthat is for 25 guesses, the number done by each person\nin this research, to deviate from 9-18 to 13-18.\nIn the series of guesses shown in this experiment a\nset of 25 guesses should give an average chance score\nof 279-50. The score may be said to be over chance or\nbeyond what we might expect chance to give when it\nis 329-50.\nIf the reader will refer to Diagram 1, he will see an\nillustration of the scoring system in use\nO-uess.

Curve z\nshows the average score for 27 A guesses, 27 B guesses\nand so on. The score is admittedly low. At one point\nit is even below expected standard deviation, but on the\nother hand there is a very definite continuation of my\nhabit of getting B guesses the best.\n\f109] Evidence for Clairvoyance in Card-Guessing 235\nDiagram 1, Curve z.

(See p. 236.)\nDiagram 2, curve y represents an average of myscore for\neach A, B, C, D, E guess whilst I was guessing alone\nfrom March to October 1924.

This characteristic\nis shown very clearly later in other people's results, and\nI had noticed it in a marked degree in my own trials alone.\nHaving been provided with a good scoring system it\nwas necessary to make out some simple directions for\nothers trjdng the experiment. Below are the directions\nsent to all those who took part.\nDirections.\n1. Take a pack of 52 playing cards.\n2. Draw one card face downwards from the pack and try\nand guess what the card is.\n\f236 Ina Jephson [PAET\n3. Record your guess under \"guess card\" on the scoring\nsheet provided.

Then take out another card, record it as before, etc.,\nand do this five times in succession at one sitting.\n\f109] Evidence for Clairvoyance in Card-Guessing 237\nBefore guessing another set of five leave an interval\nof at least some hours, preferably a day, before\nguessing again.\n7. Do not let another person see the card you have taken\nfrom the pack. The possibility of telepathy must be\nexcluded.\n8. If possible please do 25 guesses (five sets of five).\nAll records, however unsuccessful, are useful, a.nd all\ndegrees of success are allowed for in the scoring.\nThis guessing in five short series of five more or less\narranged itself. It seemed long enough to show up the\nfatigue factor and not so long as to be really boring.\nI had to allow experimenters a very wide latitude as to\nwhen and how to try for results, but as the faculty\nunder observation is obviously a spontaneous one that\nfreedom has its advantages, and we can rely to a certain\nextent for our evidence on the unexpected coincidence of\nsuccess which shows among other things in this tendency\nfor everyone to give their best guesses in the same part\nof the series. Several people wrote asking for guidance\nas to the best method or frame of mind for attempting\nthe experiment, but I was quite unable to give any\nadvice. I simply do not know and so could not enlighten\nthem. I did not ask for the experiments to be witnessed\nfor many and obvious reasons, but I will give in Dia-\ngram 3 (as it corroborates very usefully the un-\nwitnessed experiments) a small group of witnessed trials\n\u2014nine people each guessing five times.

She did not seem at\nall surprised when I asked her to try, and told me that\nshe had noticed before that she seemed to know what a\ncard was before she looked at it, and had often tried by\nherself just for fun and to pass the time away. I asked\nher to do a \" telepathic \" experiment, and cutting the\npack, I looked at the card cut which was the four of\nspades. She at once said \"4 of spades,\" and went on to\ndivine the next five cards with again a diminishing degree\nof success : 4S for 4S, lOD for 8D, 5H for QC, 3H for 6H,\n7D for 7C, 5D for 3C. Possibly the fact that my mind\nwas holding the image of the card made it easier for\nMile. Schelpe to get the card correctly.^ If I had done\na graph for the results of Mile. Schelpe's twenty-five trials,\nwe should get her A guesses scoring 125-67, her B guesses\n85-01, her C guesses scoring 82-89, her D guesses scoring\n71-91, her E guesses scoring 65-47, a very definite falling\noff from A guesses to E guesses.\nThe next diagram (4) shows the total result of the\nwhole collection of guesses. It is the result obtained by\n240 people each guessing five sets of five guesses, twenty-\nfive in all, which makes 6000 divinations. I included, of\ncourse, every result that had been done correctly with the\nright time intervals,' etc., up to the date on which I had\ncompleted the 6000 aimed at, whether the results were\ngood, bad or indifi^erent.

I have scored all\nthe A guesses together, all the B guesses together, and\nso on, so that each point on the curve represents 1200 A\nguesses, then 1200 B guesses and so on.

The theoretical chance average score\nfor 25 pairs of card-drawings is 279-50, whilst Herr Leon-\nhard for the same number gets 278-65. The theoretical\nmean expectation is 11-18, and in Herr Leonhard's series\nis 11-14.\nIt will be noticed that not at any point in the series\ndo the experimenters' guesses touch the line of mean\nexpectation, and more important still\u2014that the guesses\nwhich achieve the highest score are in this case also the\nfirst or early guesses,\u2014so that in the total results we do\nget the effect expected and hoped for from the beginning\n\u2014the suggestive \" fatigue-curve.\" It resembles rather the\nfatigue curve occurring in factories and noted in indus-\ntrial research, showing how the output starts well,\ndiminishes as the worker gets tired, and improves again\nas the prospect of rest inspires their efforts.

In\n\" guessing,\" it may be confusion or lack of spontaneity\nwhich affects success\u2014not fatigue.\nDiagram 5 is a further analysis of Diagram 4.\nThe object aimed at in this diagram is to analyse the\ncurve for the total results with a view to discovering if\nthe \"fatigue\" element would vary for experimenters of vary-\ning capacity, and in all these experiments I have assumed\nthat clairvoyant capacity was at work, since all had\nachieved scores above chance (that is to say, scores that\nwere better than 329-50 for twenty-five guesses). I made\na rather arbitrary division, taking first all those scores\nbetween 400 and 500 for curve x, then all scores between\n500 and 600 for curve y, then all scores over 600 for\ncurve z.

The verdict must remain not proven,\nbut such speculations are irresistible, and the possibility is\ncertainly worth watching.\nDiagram 6.

(If the reader will refer to the\ncomments on Mile. Schelpe's score, a good instance of this\ndeterioration will be clearly seen, her first set of five\nscoring 130-75, her last 68-43.)\nThe lower curve z is again the chance curve, the average\nscore of each guess in one-fifth the total number of 6000\ncard drawings being shown at each point.\nFigures for Diagram 6 A B C D E\nPeople - - - 13-57 12-66 13-37 12-93 12-64\nChance - - - 10-75 11-07 11-75] 11-53 10-59\nI consider this definite drop from first sets to last sets\nin the total results got by these 240 people reinforces\nvery strongly the hypothesis put forward, that we are\nhere observing at work, and progressively deteriorating, an\nunknown faculty of perception. The fact that there is a\nmarked tendency towards first-guess-success in short series\nof five does not at all necessitate that we should also get\nthis diminution of success from the beginning of the\nwhole series to the end. That both these effects do occur\nis surely rather noteworthy and suggestive. It is also a\nfurther confirmation of a characteristic which I have\nnoticed in my own efforts and which showed up again in\nmy witnessed guesses with Mr. Dingwall.\nWith regard to the total number of results shown by\ncurve y (Diagram 4), one great objection to it will im-\nmediately occur, namely\u2014how do I know that this is a\n\f246 Ina Jejjhson [part\ngenuine record of efforts to divine a certain number of\ncards ?

They may also have\nfelt obligingly \" We must do something for poor Miss\nJephson \" and scored accordingly. This doubt about the\nvahdity of the results I agree is a strong one, but there\nare also many strong arguments on the other side.\nAmongst these I should place the fact that I know a\ngood many of the experimenters, and have confidence\nin their good faith ; and with it I should couple the\nfact that I myself\u2014those people whom I know\u2014and\nthose people who are unknown to me, get the same type\nof result. I admit that this is an argument which may\nweigh more with myself than with others. I was dis-\ncussing this problem of the trustworthiness of the records\nwith a critic, and had to agree that as a large proportion\nof guessers was quite unknown to me the possibihty of\nfraud must not be lost sight of. It was suggested that\nthe curve y (Diagram 4) which shows the average of\nthe total result achieved by the experimenters, was not\nso much a \" fatigue-curve \" as a \" fraud-curve \" or a\n\" curve of obhgingness.\" The experimenter starts off by\ndoctoring the score, repents slightly after his first lapse,\nand then ends up by feeling that perhaps he has not made\nit impressive enough and so finishes up with a little\nflourish. One of my transatlantic correspondents who had\nreplied to an appeal to guess cards and to get others to\nguess also, wrote to me saying : \"I enclose results from\nMiss Georgina C. Tibbs. The latter is the only person in\nthe city of Townville whom I could rely on to fill in the\nscoring sheet.\" The names, of course, are imaginary.\nPerhaps my view is too narrowly patriotic and insular,\nbut I do not think that things with us are as bad as that.\nBut there are far more convincing reasons than these\npersonal ones for thinking that the records are worthy\nof confidence, for if the results are analysed, as they can\nbe by the help of Diagram 7, it will be found that, after\ncomplete success, which amounts to more than double\nwhat chance should give, the next class to show superiority\nis the class scoring 21-12 : that is, the class where suit\nand rank have been correctly guessed. The classes where\nnumber is concerned show success less markedly above\n\f248 Ina Jephson [part\nchance average.

Dr. Estabrooks's\naccount can be found in Bulletin 5 of the Boston Society for\nPsychic Research, February 1927. His experiments were in\ntelepathy, and cards again were the medium of experiment.\nAn agent in one room cut a pack of cards, looked at\nthe exposed card, whilst the percipient in the next room,\nat an arranged mechanical signal, recorded his impression.\nHe did a large number of experiments with many different\npercipients, guessing ^ in short series very much as we\nhave done, getting, I may say, almost precisely the same\nresults. The first or early guesses were distinctly the best.\nThere was an excess of colour and suit right, and the\nscores were higher than could be expected from chance.\nHis colour and suit successes resembled mine quite remark-\nably, as the following tables will show :\n1 Dr. Estabrooks says he tells his experimenters that they are literally\nto \" guess cards.\"\n\f254 Ina Jephson [part\nDr. Estabbooks. 1660 Card Guesses.\nColour.\nChance.

Dr. Woolley, however, drew\nmy attention to the fact that (to quote from the report),\n\" the subjects were for the most part men who had taken\npart in Series Number 1, this forming so to speak a second\nexperiment which was put through at the same sitting.''\nThe failure may perhaps again be explained by fatigue,\nor anxiety due to the added distance may have acted\ndetrimentally.\n1 A curious fact seems worth noting, that on the three occasions when\nthe conditions may be said to have been adverse (my witnessed experi-\nments with Mr. Dingwall, Dr. Estabrooks's long-distance experiments\nand Professor Richet's long-continued ones) the scores are reduced not\nChance.\n160\n160\n320\nActual.\n154\n153\n307\nChance.\n80\n80\nActual.\n76\n54\n160 130\n\f256 Ina Jephson [part\nDr. Estabrooks's results were on the whole considerably\nbetter than my collection (in spite of his subjects having\nbeen chosen largely, I think, at random). Whether this\nsuperiority is due to the experiments being done under better\nconditions, I do not know. I should suspect my group of\nsubjects of being more clairvoyant than the normal,\nhaving been selected from among people interested in\nthis subject, and therefore hkely to have had previous\nexperience of clairvoyance, and so possibly a bias towards\nsuccess. A large proportion of the S.P.R. presumably\njoin owmg to experiences of a supernormal nature. My\nfirst experimenters I had chosen with care because they\nwere successful in other experiments. The readers of\nLight would probably also be already interested, and then\nthere was a group who had been supposed successful in\nDr. Woolley's broadcast telepathy experiment. In spite of\nthis the results are inferior to Dr. Estabrooks's collection.\nThere is another difference in the conditions of the two sets\nof experiments which must be considered, and which may\nhave helped Dr. Estabrooks's percipients towards scoring\nmore successfully than mine. In his experiment an agent\nwas present, in mine there was no agent. The question\narises again, which arose over Mile. Schelpe's \" telepathic\n\"\nexperiment : is it easier for the clairvoyant to divine a\ncard when the card is known to another intelhgence ?\nIt may give him two sources of information\u2014the card\nitself, and the card in the mind of the agent. I think\nthis may be the case, and I can picture the \" clair-\nvoyant \" as capable of perceiving supernormally both a\nmaterial object such as a card, and a mental image such\nas a card in the mind of another person. I admit this\nis stretching the meaning of the word clairvoyance to\nmore than its accustomed use, but if we do ex-\ntend clairvoyance to include the perception of mental\nimages as well as material objects the hypothesis of\n\" telepathy \" becomes redundant and unnecessary, and\nmerely to equality with scores which chance might give but they sink\nvmiformly below chance-average. Further, we get this below average\nscore (in Dr. Estabrooks's, I have not the data for Professor Richet's)\ncoinbined with the characteristic fatigue curve.\n\f109] Evidence for Clairvoyance in Card-Guessing 257\nwe shall consider that the supernormal activities of the\npercipient alone will account for the majority of the known\nphenomena of supernormal perception. The fatal charm\nof speculation has tempted me too far. This attractively\neconomical theory must remain for the present purely\nspeculative. Further experiment, purposely devised to\nconfine the problem to this special issue, can alone throw\nHght on it.\nDr. Estabrodks's experiments are of great value to\nmine in many ways, but it must be remembered that on\ntwo other points our experiments are not exactly com-\nparable. Firstly, his experiments are witnessed, mine\nare unwitnessed. Secondly, his percipients are in a\nseparate room from the card, whilst my percipients\npresumably held the card or at least touched it.\nThe disadvantage of imwitnessed experiments I have\nalready discussed ; the drawback to the method whereby\nthe card is held in the hand must be further examined.\nWhere that method is employed we must allow for several\nnormal and prosaic reasons for success before we need ascribe\nsuccess to clairvoyance. The most obvious of these is the\nhkehhood that the experimenters consciously or uncon-\nsciously know or remember variations and marks on the\nback of the cards. I am always much struck when\nplaying cards with children hov\/ quick they are to notice\nand make use of such marks.\nAnother possible source of success, less normal, or at\nleast less consciously recognised, may be a hyper-sensitive-\nness of touch or sight, enabhng the experimenter to feel\nor see a faint impress on the card of pip or picture.\nThis subject is discussed by Mrs. VerraU in an interest-\ning paper (closely relevant to this series of experiments),\n\" Some Experiments on the Supernormal Acquisition of\nKnowledge \" {Proceedings S.P.R., vol. xi., 1895, p. 174).\nMrs. VerraU undertook a long series of guessing cards\nunder different conditions with a view to testing some of\nthe suggested causes of success. Her conclusion is\nthat hyperaesthesia of sight and touch does contribute\nto the success, but that it cannot alone account for it,\nor cover all the facts.\n\f258 Ina Jephson [part\nI must admit frankly the possibility that these normal\nreasons for success may account for the high scoring in\nmy experiments, but we can have unfortunately no\nevidence as to the amount, nor does there seem any\nreason why these more normal sources of success should\nonly affect the score in the early guesses, skill or prac-\ntice being more likely to increase the later scores. The\nstriking hkeness between Dr. Estabrooks's results and\nmine, even when the modifying conditions of experiment\nhave been taken into consideration, in my view give\nencouragement to the theory that sotne supernormal\nperception contributed to the success in both sets of\nresults and that very similar results can be got without\nan agent as rvith one.\nDr. Estabrooks's own conclusions from his experiment\non certain points coincide with mine. He found for\ninstance, as have many others, that close attention by\nthe percipient, anxiety, or a too analytical frame of mind\nare all detrimental to success ; and moreover, he felt he\ncould know what type of person was most Hkely to succeed.\nWhilst I am on the subject of experiments in America,\nI will draw attention to Diagram 9.^ It is the average\nscore of the A, B, C, D, E guesses of twelve people each\nguessing five times. Dr. Walter Prince yevy kindly col-\nlected these results for me, being in ignorance, of course,\nof the effect hoped for ; and here again, though I admit\nthis is not a very large number of trials, we get a very\ndefinite fatigue-curve. Then in April he made some trials\nhimself, getting what I have come to consider an absol-\nutely typical good result, starting off with a complete\nsuccess, Queen of Clubs for Queen of Clubs, getting his\nA guesses the best, and his first set of five better than\nhis last set of five, and an above-average score of 410-38.\nHe tried at least twenty more sets, but his initial success\nwas the only \" quite right \" achieved in the whole series.\nDr. Prince in sending me the record of the experiment\ncalled my attention to the significance of the gradual\ndeterioration, saying he had noticed on former occasions,\n1 Table for Diagram 9.

Two I\ncould not resist : namely, experiments with cards sealed\nin hght-proof envelopes, and long distance experiments.\nDiagram 10 shows some experiments with cards in\nopaque envelopes. Having collected a good many rather\npromising results with cards which had been placed by\npeople other than the experimenters in opaque photo-\ngraphic, light-proof envelopes, it seemed worth trying some\nunder test conditions. So i\\Ir. Dingwall very kindly\nsealed up for me five numbered envelopes, in each of\nwhich he placed one unseen playing card. The envelopes\nwere, of course, light proof and burglar proof.

I\nshould expect women to be more successful than men\n\u2014for all down the ages there have been more witches\nthan wizards, and the weU-worn phrase, \" woman's in-\ntuition \" may have a grain of truth in it. In 'this card-\ndivining experiment out of the 240 people who tried,\n145 were women, 93 men (of two I was unable to learn\nthe sex) ; 75 per cent, of the women showed fatigue-\ncurves, 44 per cent, of the men, whilst women's average\nscore was shghtly higher than the men's. It would be\nmost interesting if this tendency should be confirmed by\nfurther research.\nAlthough this report is becoming intolerably long, I\nshould hke before I end to refer briefly to work of earher\ninvestigators in similar experiments with cards. Mrs.\nVerrall's experiments in 1895 have akeady been men-\ntioned, but as far back as 1882 Barrett, Gurney and Myers\ntried some \" telepathic \" experiments with cards, with re-\nmarkable above-chance success\u2014(i^e^ori on Committee on\nThough Reading, July 1882). In 1887, Dr. Schiller\nand his brother experimented both in telepathy and\nclairvoyance [Proc. S.P.R., vol. iv. p. 209). The card\nthought of or to be divined was recorded in this case by\nDr. Schiller's brother, Mr. F. N. Schiller, writing auto-\nmatically through planchette,\u2014again with results above\nchance. In 1895 {Proc. S.P.B., vol. xi. p. 2) Mr. Henry\nRawson reports on experiments in thought-transference with\ncards ; he remarks, \" I found myseK almost invariably less\nsuccessful in every series of experiments after the first.''\nIn France Professor Richet's long series of experi-\nments reported on in an article in the Eevue Philosophique\n(vol. xviii., Dec. 1884), \"La suggestion mentale et le\ncalcul des Probabihtes,\" gave results which correspond\nclosely to both mine and Dr. Estabrooks's. He has :\n1st guess success.\nabove chance success,\nabove average colour success,\n\f264 Ina Jephson [part\nand, a most interesting point, beloiv chance success where\nthe conditions were adverse, that is, in a prolonged\nseries. Professor Richet's experiments were nominally\nin \" telepathy,\" but he does not lay stress on telepathy,\nhe affirms only that some supernormal agency is at work.\nI was dehghted when I read Prof. Richet's article to\nfind some confirmation of my views from a source which\nI resj)ect so deeply.\nM. Rene Sudre, in his article on \" Clairvoyance and\nthe Theory of Probabihties,\" Psychic Research, Feb. 1928,\nalso alludes to some experiments with Eugenie by Pro-\nfessor Richet, the cards being in fight-proof envelopes.\nThe table he gives makes a perfectly typical fatigue-\ncurve, and he calls attention to this early-success effect,\nbut I do not think he has reahsed sufficiently its value\nfor experimental purposes.\nI should like here to put up a brief defence of experi-\nments with cards, as M. Rene Sudre's article is written to\ntry and dissuade investigators from undertaking experi-\nments of this character, where the results have to be com-\npared to chance on a mathematical basis. M. Sudre objects\nthat few investigators have the necessary mathematical\nquafifications. I have none, but I have been able to\nsupply the deficiency by enfisting the help of mathe-\nmaticians ;\nand others can do as I have done. The calcu-\nlations given in this paper have almost entirely been done\nand checked by competent mathematicians. Another draw-\nback to which M. Sudre calls attention is that in these\nexperiments the negative results must be added to the\npositive ones. I agree that this may be most misleading.\nIt has always reminded me of the old story of the two\nmen, one bow-legged and the other knock-kneed, who\nwere able to enter the Irish Constabulary by having\ntheir characteristics averaged. The analogy in a problem\nof curves is really very exact. M. Sudre's plea is for\nan experiment which would give a result so definitely and\nclearly beyond chance, that a single success in it would\nprove the existence of clairvoyant faculty. This might be\neffective from the point of view of mathematical proof, but\nM. Sudre does not allow for the fact (to which Prof. Richet\n\f109] Evidence for Clairvoyance in Card-Guessing 265\nhas drawn attention) that our belief in any phenomenon\nis ahnost entirely due to its repetition. It will only be when\nwe can show the effects of clairvoyance at work in in-\nstances which can be repeated an indefinite number of\ntimes that we shall be convinced of its reahty.\nThe use of a closed and rigid system, such as a pack of\ncards, gives scope for the detection of any recurring charac-\nteristics of the faculty under observation ; and I feel that\nthe importance of working within such a closed system,\nwith which other experiments may be compared, far\noutweighs any difficulties there may be in examining the\nfacts once they have been assembled. The main difficulty\nin psychic research is to get a sufficiently definite and an\nexactly repeatable basis for experiment, and here at least,\nwhatever the inferences, the facts are explicit.\nI will spare my readers a summary of the experiment,\nas I must have stressed to weariness the points which\nI have considered important. The interest must lie, not\nso much in its character but in the natural inference that\nif this supposed faculty of supernormal perception really\nexists we do not know what possible limit to put to its\nactivities. Looked at in connection with cards alone this\ncurious leakage of knowledge if accepted as a fact might\nhave a marked effect. Bridge parties will become scenes\nof strain and suspicion and only those who show no\nclairvoyant power and have been passed by the S.P.R. as\nbeing free from \" fatigue -curves \" will be allowed to play ;\nour best clairvoyants will leave abruptly for Texas or\nMonte Carlo. But the more serious import of the experi-\nment must surely be that if its inferences are accepted,\nwe must widen considerably our conception of our mental\npowers. It is most unlikely that this perceptive gift\nworks only in connection with playing cards. Many other\npossible manifestations of it crowd to mind\u2014such as\nbook-tests by mediums\u2014the reading of sealed packets,\netc., etc. A fundamental change in our conception of\nhuman faculty must take place.\n\"To remain reasonable,\" says Prof. Bergson, \"is to\nremain at work,\" and the work involved in these experi-\nments for the moment being happih^ over, I will prove\n\f266 Ina Jephson [part\nthe truth of Prof. Bergson's dictum by indulging my\nfancy.\nI think that the many extra-normal phenomena with\nwhich investigators in psychic research become famihar\ncan be more easily explained, or at least can hve more\nharmoniously with our other conceptions of hfe, if we\nadopt the following view of mind and brain. (I did not\noriginate it, and probably have distorted it somewhat for my\nown use, but I find it helpful.) This view of mind regards\nmind as \" consciousness,\" and ascribes to the brain and\nsense organs the role of an instrument of exclusion and\nselection. It pictures consciousness as infinitely receptive,\nand in danger of being overwhelmed by the thronging\nimpressions from the objective world were it not for the\nkind offices of the brain, which excludes any material\nwhich is not relevant to the activities of the \" conscious-\nness \" which it serves. If we take this view we can\npicture the facts which we acquire supernormally (that\nis without the use of the normal senses) as facts which\nhave somehow avoided exclusion. They have as it were\npassed the hall porter (whose duty it is to exclude\nunorthodox visitors), whilst he was asleep. In our ex-\nperiment with cards, for instance, we are not helped\nto success by using our brains in the ordinary way. The\ninformation we seek seems to shp in best when our\nbrains are otherwise employed ; in other words, and as\nwe should expect, when the hall porter is busy or\nslumbering. Another analogy may be taken. If we\ncompare the \" consciousness \" to a sensitive plate in a\ncamera and the brain to the lens, the plate (in a camera\nwhich is completely hght-proof) can only record the\nimpressions selected for it by the lens. If, however, any\nhght enters by an accidental opening in the side of the\ncamera the plate at once is Hable to record extra impres-\nsions. It will record \" facts inaccessible to its normal\nlens \" ; in the camera-world it would very soon be\nconsidered \" clairvoyant \" ; it might even be fined for\npredicting the future, as it could, quite genuinely, be\nable to record facts which were \" round the corner\n\"\nfrom its light-proof companions.\n\f109] Evidence for Clairvoyance in Card-Guessing 267\nThere are many speculations and tempting correlations\nwhich I should like to indulge in, but I must refrain.\nGUESSES\nA B C D E\n1\n-\nt-\n\\\n-A\ni -\n1-\n-X\n-A\n\\\n-\nA-\n-A-\nit\n_ J .\n-\\\n\\\nV-\n-V- \/\nt- \"5;\ns\ni-\n~~r\n-t a:\nh- -A>-\n- ^\n\\-- i\n--\\-\n\u2014\nN\nEftt FATmi\n1\n^-\n\\^\nJ\u2014\nL\nft\n1\n- \\ 1\n-\n-J\u2014 -\nr-\n\/--\n1.\n-\nDIAGRAM 12.\nI have saved up the most attractive diagram (12) for a\nsuitable curtain.\" It has.

I have not given the list of them because\npossibly further experiments may be undertaken, and I do not\nwant my experimenters to know which their card preferences\nare, since it makes spontaneous guessing so much more\ndifficult ; but I hope to report on this aspect of the subject\nlater. Mr. Fisher at first informed me that card preferences\ndid not affect the scoring\u2014but he subsequently modified his\nopinion slightly, and I give below his revised version. It is\na slight modification of his first figures. It has not been\npossible to rescore all the existing records on the new figures,\nbut the very slight preference for plain cards and the antipathy\nto pictm-e cards which appeared in the total results would\nnot have been enough to affect the score in any appreciable\nmanner. Then there was another question as to whether\nthe actual cards which had been drawn showed preferences\nfor certain cards\u2014for if there had been any marked irregularity\nit would affect the scoring. I have not overlooked the point,\nand so far as I have gone into the matter, I think I can\nsafely say there is not enough irregularity possibly to affect\nthe score to any serious degree, but I hope to make a further\nreport later.\nDe. Fisher's Statement concerning the Effect of\nPsychological Card Preferences.\nThe theory of scoring card coincidences is based upon the\ncomparison between pairs of cards chosen at random, and\npairs of cards of which one is drawn at random from a pack,\nwhile the other is obtained by the subject in an attempt to\nguess or divine which card has been drawn. If these two cases\n\f270 Appendix [past\ndiffered only in the possession by some subjects of the power\nto guess a card in some degree like that drawn, the existence\nof such a power could have been tested strictly by the method\nof scoring previously proposed (Proc. S.P.R., vol. xxxiv. p. 181,\nJuly 1924). There is, however, a second difference, which at\nfirst sight appears to be without influence on the results, yet\nwhich requires in an exact treatment some modification of the\nscoring system previously devised.\nIt has been shown that in attempting to guess an unknown\ncard people in general\u2014and the same is probably true of each\nperson in particular\u2014exhibit a rather marked preference for\ncertain cards. The effect of such preferences on the frequency\nof different degrees of success may best be perceived by con-\nsidering an extreme case in which, on every occasion, the\nfirst card which presents itself to the mind of the subject is\nalways the same, for example, the King of Hearts. The card\nactually drawn will be with equal frequency every card of the\npack, and it is evident that the guess will be right in colour\nhalf the trials, and right in suit in one quarter ; also it will\nbe right in value once in thirteen trials, these being in each\ncase the probabilities for the same degree of agreement between\ntwo cards drawn at random. In the case of rank, however,\nthere will be this difference, for the real card will be a picture\ncard only three times in 13 trials, while the probability of two\ncards chosen at random being both plain or both picture cards\nis 109 in 169. The latter probability will in fact only repre-\nsent the true chance if the subject guesses picture cards with\nthe correct frequency, namely three times in thirteen trials.\nIt will not be correct if he always guesses the King of Hearts,\nnor in less measure, will it be correct if, while varying his\nguess he yet guesses picture cards with more than the correct\nfrequency.\nThe effect of this factor is thus somewhat to penalise those\nsubjects who have a psychological preference for picture cards,\nand if this preference is general, so to give generally unduly\nlow scores. On the other hand persons with a preference for\nplain cards will have enjoyed a slight advantage. In an\nexact analysis, it is possible to overcome the difficulty by\nscoring the two cases independently. Below are given two\nscoring systems appropriate for the two cases in which the\n\f109] Appendix 271\ncard guessed by the subject is a plain card or a picture card\nrespectively. The nature of the real card does not affect the\nsystem.\nPlain card chosen. Picture card chosen.\n0. R. N. 0. R. N.\n0. : -73 3-78 30-54 0. : 1-7 16-45 27-50\nC. : 8-79 11-84 38-6 C. : 8-67 23-42 34-47\nS. : 16-85 19-89 46-65 S. : 15-64 30-39 41-44\nboth these systems the mean score, if the card guessed is\nindependent of the true card, is 11-18, and the standard\ndeviation of the mean of 25 guesses is 2\"0. The effect of\nthe change is simply to put upon an equal footing those whose\npreference leans to plain cards, or to picture cards respectively ;\nit seems unlikely that it will greatly alter the average of\nany extensive group of scores.\nIt will be noted as an apparent defect in the use of two\nscoring tables that the effect on the score of guessing right\ninstead of wrong on an even chance, for example, in colour,\nis 8-06 for plain cards and only 6-97 for picture cards. A\nguesser, in fact, whose strong point lay in colour or suit, will\nrun up a big score quicker if he sticks to plain cards ; this is\na necessary consequence of using a single composite system for\nscoring different possible faculties. The different faculties may\nbe examined separately merely by enumerating the number of\nsuccesses and failures in each point (i) Colour, (ii) Suit, if the\ncolour be right, (iii) Value, and comparing the observed num-\nbers with those expected by chance. Only in the case of\n(iv) Rank, will the choice of a plain or a picture card affect\nthe expected frequencies, and only in this faculty wUl a\nseparate enumeration be necessary.\n\f272 Review [part\nREVIEW.\nLa Levitation. Contribution historique et critique a I'etude du\nmerveilleux, par Olivier Leroy, agrege de I'Universite.\nLibraii'ie Valois, Paris.\nThis book of more than 380 pages (appendix and indices\ninclusive) is written by a Roman Catholic, a fact which,\n\u2014\nmistakenly, as I think,\u2014is not made apparent until nearly\nthe end.\nThe book, however, is written almost throughout in a\nscientific and critical spirit ; and M. Leroy may be truly said\nto be an amazingly wide reader. He is also well acquainted\nwith recent researches in the domain of Physical Spiritism,\nhas read the late Frank Podmore's work on Modern Spiritualism,\nand such names as those of D. D. Home, Eusapia Paladino,\nStainton Moses, and \" Willy \" (Schneider) appear freely under\nhis pen.\nBy far the greatest part of the book is devoted to hagio-\ngraphy, as M. Leroy is of opinion that \" Cathohc hagiography\nalone possesses on levitation a written and ancient tradition,\ncontinuous and varied, supported by controlled and precise\ndocuments. . . . Catholic hagiography among doubtful facts,\nor even facts probably interpolated, presents a certain number\nof cases where the proofs of the reality of levitation offer\nthose guarantees which we are in the habit of requiring of\nHistory \"\n(p. 349).\nAs a matter of fact, beginning with St. Dunstan, Archbishop\nof Canterbury (918-988), and ending with cases taking place\nin the nineteenth if not in the twentieth century, the author\npresents us with an endless series of alleged levitations,\ncopiously quoting from the Acta Sanctorum and other sources.\nHe is the first to admit, nevertheless, that from an evidential\nstandpoint the great majority of these cases proves nothing\n\f109] Review 273\nat all. Such an admission instead of weakening his position,\nnaturally only strengthens it. And we are the more inclined\nto lend an attentive ear to his argumentation in regard to\nthose cases which, in his opinion, are of a conclusive and\nconvincing character.\nOn the whole, the following cases deserve, according to him,\npeculiar attention as being well attested (in some cases \"perhaps\nexcellently attested).\nSt. Joseph of Copertino (1603-1663). In the bull of canonisa-\ntion of this saint (Pope Benedict XIV.) it is stated that no\nother saint can be compared to him in the domain of \" ecstatic\nflights.\"\nSaint Theresa of Avila (1515-1582).\nSamt Alphonso of Liguori (1696-1787).\nThe Blessed Andre-Hubert Fournet (the first levitations\noccurring in 1820).\nJoseph Benoit Cottolengo (died in 1842).\nMarie de Jesus (Mfere du Bourg). Several levitations are\nmentioned occm-ring in the forties and fifties of last century.\nBernardino Realino (died 1616).\nFrancisco Saurez, the well-known Jesuit and theologian\n(seventeenth century).\nSome of the incidents narrated in connection with these\npersonalities are both apparently quite inexplicable by the\naction of known forces and seem to leave nothing to be\ndesired in the way of attestation. Without entering into\nminute details I will content myself with stating that in\nmy opinion these cases constitute an important body of\nevidence not to be lightly set aside. They certainly make it\nappear \" more probable than not \" (to use an expression of\nMrs. Sidgwick's about the reahty of the Physical Phenomena\nof Spiritism many years ago) that such things as genuine\nlevitations of persons later beatified or canonised by the\nRoman Catholic Church did really occur.\nThis is imdoubtedly the impression produced on me by\nM. Leroy's book, or rather by a few of the hagiographic cases\ntherein mentioned. I feel bound, however, to make the\nfollowing observations. It does not seem to me that the\nauthor takes sufficiently into account the possibility of piae\nfraudes as a causal explanation, though he mentions \" hagio-\ns\n\f274 Review [part\ngraphic amplifications \" as he chooses to call them ; this is\nperhaps not enough. We are told, for instance, that the\nmost celebrated of Joseph of Copertino's levitations occurred\nin the presence of Prince John-Frederic of Brunswick (1649).\nThis young Prince visited in that year the principal courts\nof Europe. When in Rome, he decided to go to Assisi to\nsee St. Joseph. He twice was present at two masses said\nby the saint, and witnessed two levitations, of which one of\nfive minutes' duration. He was so impressed by what he\nhad seen that he became a Roman Catholic, one of the\ntwo chamberlains who accompanied him later following his\nexample. Now it is obvious that in this case the saint's\nentourage had the greatest interest in producing the most\npowerful impression possible on the Prince's imagination.\nAny artifice in this direction could only have been considered\nas laudable : for would not the aim have been to save from\neternal perdition a human soul, a princely soul ? That in\nthis year of grace 1928 many Roman Catholic priests would\nhave disapproved such an artifice I have no doubt ; but\nthe case may have been quite different in the seventeenth\ncentury just after the Thirty Years' War. To the five very\nreasonable \" crHires eliminatoires \" which, the author thinks,\nare apt to give us some security in the research of cases\nof authentic levitation if there be such (p. 217), I am therefore\ninclined to add a sixth one running as follows : we ought\nnot to attach much value to such cases even well attested\nwhere there is very strong reason to suspect that a group\nof persons was intensely inteiested in producing the levitation.^\nAmong the cases narrated I find one which may perhaps\nraise in the reader's mind a doubt as to whether even in\nthe best attested cases confusion was invariably excluded.\nWe are told (p. 152) that in 1746, at Foggia, St. Alphonso\nof Liguori was publicly levitated when preaching in church\n\" on Mary's glories.\" But it so happens than an exactly\nsimilar incident (even including a ray of light which, starting\nfrom an image of the Madonna, struck the preacher's face)\nis related as having occurred in 1756 at Amalfi. Of course\nit is possible that there may have been two incidents, but\n1 To mt) tilt! chief question in the present instance is, howev; r, this : ia the\ncase \" well attested \" ?\n\f109] Review 275\nthis similarity will appear to some suspicious. M. Leroy\nsays himself that the similarity is so great \" qu'on croirait\nfaute de temoignage a une deuxieme version d\\i meme evene-\nment.\" Are these femoignages \" decisive ?\nIt is further obvious that in some cases levitations are\nspoken of by one narrator where another sees, apparently,\nno supernormal phenomena at eAl. Thus Cardinal de Ville-\ncom't, author of a huge history of St. Alphonso of Liguori,\nmentions two cases where the saint, already quite old and\nalmost motionless, was levitated over his armchair. But\nFather Berthe, author of another biography of the same saint,\nrelates the same two incidents in terms which, properly speaking,\nmay not suggest a levitation (pp. 157-158). In another instance\nwhilst Cardinal Villecourt again speaks of a levitation. Father\nBerthe merely mentions that the saint se livra a de tels\ntransports qu'il n'en dormit pas la nuit suivante \"\n(p. 159).\nOne cannot help asking oneself whether such characteristic\ndiscrepancies could not be much more multiplied.\nHowever, for me the chief consideration is that of the\noriginal documents. Some, or many, of the works containing\nbiographies of the saints in que.stion are said to have been\nwritten on the basis of documents having figured in the\nprocesses of beatification or canonisation, but the critical\nreader is well entitled to ask to be allowed to see if not the\ndocuments themselves, at least officially certified copies made\nanew. Seeing that a few of the saints asserted to have been\nlevitated lived in the nineteenth century, the documents in\nquestion ought to be easily accessible, and I venture to suggest\nthat an effort be made in that direction. A couple of centuries\nor so ago cojnes even certified might perhaps have been\ninadequate in dealing with such a problem, but happily we\nlive in a more honest and more enhghtened age.\nMeanwhile I can only say that the impression produced\nby a small selection of the cases quoted by M. Leroy is\nalmost irresistible. I have in particular in view the evidence\nof the surgeon Francesco di Pierpolo describing a levitation\nof St. Joseph of Copertino in the course of an operation\n(p. 137). No better evidence could be desired\u2014of course with\nthe reservation made above as to the documents.\nOutside the hagiographic levitations M. Leroy is of opinion\n\f276 Review [part\nthat the ensemble of the alleged facts is rather of an elusive\ncharacter. \" The magico-religious facts of Oriental sects, remote\nand fabulous, elude every criticism. The exploits of the\nsorcerers whether savage or otherwise also belong to uncon-\ntrollable folklore. The evolutions of the possessed grow\ntoo restrained when approaching our time for us not to suspect\nexuberance in the old narratives \"\n(p. 198).\nThe author seems to me to pass somewhat too Ughtly over\nthe fakir performances. He mentions JacoUiot's experiments\nwith the fakir Covindassamy (p. 19) only to state that the\nauthor of Le voyage au pays des fakirs charmeurs does not\ninspire in him any confidence (p. 188). The author further\nnotes that \" whether in India or in the Far East we find\nourselves in the presence of a mere theoretical tradition\nunsupported by any controllable fact \"\n(p. 189).\nAs a matter of fact, though I have never made a special\nstudy of Indian mysteries, I have come across two first-hand\ncases of levitation apparently excluding every possibility of\ntrickery. In the first case related to me by a Russian\ngentleman a fakir was levitated to a very great height ^ in\nthe presence of a crowd. I had every confidence in this\ngentleman, now deceased. In the second case a Rumanian\ndescribed to me the levitation of a fakir in daylight in\nSingapore, he (the Rumanian) assuring himself by contact\nthat the fakir's feet were off the ground. (I have failed,\nthough I have tried, to obtain from this Rumanian a\nwritten statement.) It seems therefore to me\u2014unless I be\nin this case a specially privileged person\u2014that such incidents\nare more frequent than is often supposed. I wish a serious\neffort could be made to collect more of them.\nOf course they do not apparently exclude hallucination ; but\nmost of the hagiographic cases also do not exclude it. Though\nI have found in M. Leroy's book some evidence of the non-\nhallucinatory character of some of the episodes (I mean, of\ncourse, the best attested ones), this evidence amounts to little.\nAnd I think M. Leroy dismisses \" fascination,\" as he calls it,\nin a little too cavalier a fashion. He writes (p. 328) :\nA criticism of this hypothesis can be summed up in a\n' About twice the height of a five-storied building. Cf. Zeitschr. *ur\nkritisch. Okkult., I Band, 3 Heft, pp. 196-200.\n\f109] Review 277\nfew lines ; in fact it I'emains to be proved that suggestion\ncan operate on a normal man in the waking state without\npreliminary manauvres. It becomes still more unlikely\nin the case of a crowd. Even were it possible, the idea\nof the mystic suggesting [levitation] to those around him\nmust be rejected for the following reasons : (1) the Saint\ndoes not wish to be seen when levitated but is afraid\n[of the prospect] ; (2) some Saints experienced levitations\nwhen believing themselves alone.\nOn the contrary, 1 am rather inchned to think that where\nardent and intense religious faith is concerned, a crowd may\nsometimes make easier the propagation of a hallucination or\nquasi-hallucination. What do we know, first of all, as to how\nmany people in this crowd share in the impression ? The\npoint de depart of the hallucination may be some modest\nbut concrete fact, such as the \" mystic \" rising on tiptoes\n(quite possibly in a genuinely \" ecstatic \" state). If the\nposition of the man is such that his feet are not seen, if\nthe crowd is already sufficiently emp>oignee by him, if a saint's\nnimbus already encircles his head in the popular imagination\n\u2014last not least : if the audience is a southern one, a delusion\nen masse is, I think, likely to spread hke wildfire. I have\nespecially in view when writing this the incidents related of\nSt. Alphonso in Foggia and (or ?) in Amalfi. I wish, however,\nthat there be no misunderstanding : such explanations will\n7iot cover some of the best facts.\nNot to make too long a review long enough already, (but\nthe subject, especially as presented by M. Leroy, is fascinating !)\nI will content myself with the following cursory remarks.\nPp. 29-32. Extracts are given by the author from the\nproces-verbal of an examination in 1591 of a possessed woman\nof Louviez, named Frangoise Fontaine. She was exorcised,\nand during the ceremony was, in the presence of several\npersons, repeatedly levitated and carried about in the air in\na most extraordinary way. The original of this proces-verbal,\nwe are told, is in the Paris BibliotMque Nationale, MS. No.\n24122 du fonds frangais.\nThe writer notes (p. 57) that he has been unable to find\nin the records of the Protestant Chm-ches any statements as\nto levitations of Protestant \" mystics.\" In particular he\n\f278 Review [PABT\nthinks it noteworthy that no such beliefs have been engendered\nby the \" overheated atmosphere of the revivals.\"\nHe suggests no explanation. Were I convinced of the\ngenuineness of levitation (as yet I am only inclined to believe\nin that genuineness) I would tentatively point out that Pro-\ntestantism having severed itself from the Mediaeval Church\nand adopted on so many points the exact contre-pied of the\ndoctrines of the latter, it is but natural that there may be\ndisseminated far and wide through the believing Protestant\nmasses a psychological unconscious something specially inhibiting\nthe production of such specifically mediaeval phenomena as\nlevitation and stigmatisation.^\nP. 211. History repeats itself. In 1220, we are told, Hugh,\nBishop of Lincoln, learns that a nun lives at Leicester who\nsustains her existence through the Eucharist alone : whereupon\nhe at once sends fifteen clericals to watch her during fifteen\ndays, without ever losing her from view. Put four Franciscan\nnuns in the place of the fifteen clericals, and you have exactly\none of the most striking and best attested apparently super-\nnormal episodes connected with Therese Neumann and\nKonnersreuth.\nIn a footnote on p. 236 it is stated (on the basis of\n\" private confidential statements to a friend who has repeated\nthem to M. Leroy) that Mr. Andrew Lang did not doubt\nthe authenticity of Joseph of Copertino's levitations.\nOn p. 269 it is asserted that, so far as the writer knows,\nno mediumistic levitation of the human body has ever occurred\nin full light. If by \" mediumistic \" levitations fakir levitations\nare also meant, such a statement is incorrect, and I am not\nsure that levitations in good light have never been attributed\nto D. D. Home.2\nAs I said in the beginning of this review, the author reveals\nhis Roman Catholic convictions at the end of his book only,\n^ On p. 57 a case of levitation is mentioned in connection with a\nllussian (therefore non-Catholic) Saint : Seraphim of Sarov (nineteenth\ncentury). I doubt if it is as well attested as we could desire.\n^Cf., e.g., D. D. Home. His Life and Mission, p. 299: \"It was asked\nif the phenomena of levitation did not invariably occur in semi -darkness.\n' No,' replied Lord Crawford . . ., 'I once saw Home in full light stand-\ning seventeen inches from the ground.' \" Ed.\n\f109] Review 279\nand the reader must not be surprised therefore that to him\n(M. Leroy) the mediumistic levitations (and presumably the\nother Physical Phenomena too) should in the last analysis\nbe of diabolical (\" demoniaque \") origin. Those of us who\nlike myself reject this hypothesis for one reason or another\nhave at their disposal, in my opinion, a very cogent argument.\nSatan is considered by those who beUeve in him a very\npowerful being. If so, why do experiments in Physical\nPhenomena almost always fail whenever crucial tests are\napplied ?\nBefore parting with M. Leroy's very remarkable work, I\nwish to note the impression of the greatness of the Roman\nCatholic Clhurch which emanates from his book. For no other\nbody has been able to produce in the sphere which here\ninterests us a mass of evidence so impressive and so volumi-\nnous. Compared with the hagiographical material all the rest\ndwindles into insignificance. Of course the sceptic is free\nto point out that if the yogi-fakir confraternity had possessed\nthe same powerful and systematic organisation and the same\nresources material and moral, they might have produced results\nequally striking and imposing ! Still we must count with\nfacts as they are, not as they might have been.\nPeeovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\n\f\fSOME AUTOMATIC SCRIPTS PURPORTING TO BE\nINSPIRED BY MARGARET VELEY, POET AND\nNOVELIST (1843-1887).\nPART I.\nBy W. H. SALTER.\nDuring the year 1927 and the early part of 1928 two\nmembers of the Society, Miss Margaret Hunt and Mr. F.,^\nwriting automatically in conjunction, produced a number of\nscripts containing what purport to be communications\nfrom \"Margaret Veley.\" There was a real person called\nMargaret Veley (pronounced Velly), who was born in 1843\nand died in 1887, and who wrote poems and novels.\nThe scripts consist partly of verse and partly of state-\nments as to her ancestry, relatives and friends, and as to\nincidents of her life.\nThis is not Mr. F.'s first experience in automatic writing.\nHe is the \" Mr. V.\" of the Oscar Wilde scripts, printed\nin the Occult Review for 1923. A little later he and my\nwife (Mrs. Salter) had a few sittings together for automatic\nwriting, at which some verse was produced quite unlike\nthe automatic scripts my wife produces by herself, of\nwhich numerous examples have already been printed in\noar Proceedings. No claim was made as regards author-\nship in the scripts produced jointly by Mr. V. and my\nwife.\n^ The real names of the automatists were given at a meeting of the\nSociety on the 24th October, 1928, when part of this paper was read-\nWhile they have no objection to their identity being disclosed to\ntheir fellow-members, they consider that they might suffer professionally\nif the fact of their practising automatic writing were made known to\nthe general public. Mr. V., it may be stated, has no connection with\nthe Veley family. His pseudonym, as appears from the next para-\ngraph, was established in 1923.\nT\n\f282 W. H. Salter. [part\nIn the sittings with Miss Hunt Mr. V. held the pencil,\nand Miss Hunt held his hand. If she removed her hand\nthe writing at once stopped.\nIt seems clear, as regards the sittings both with my\nwife and Miss Hunt, that Mr. V. is the \"predominant\npartner.\" Mr. V. can indeed write automatically by himself,\nbut only slowly and with difficulty. The presence of a\nsecond person seems to remove an inhibition, and enable\nhim to write with great fluency. The personality of the\nassistant automatist seems also to influence to some extent\nthe contents of the scripts (see further Mr. V.'s statement,\np. 333).\nThe difference between the cases of Oscar Wilde and\nMargaret Veley is obvious. Every fairly well-informed\nperson has some knowledge of Oscar Wilde's life, and\nsome familiarity with his literary style. Of Margaret\nVeley and her works few people nowadays have even\nheard, although she was a person of some note in her\nown generation.\nMr. V. informs me that he knew nothing whatever\nabout her, when the scripts began, beyond having seen\nher name in an old volume of Harjoer's Magazine for\n1881 (see his statement, p. 331, below).\nI confess my complete ignorance of her imtil recently.\nAfter several of the scripts had been written Mr. V.\nasked me to look into the case. I did not then know\nwhether she was a real or a mythical personage, but on\nconsulting at home the Index to the Dictionary of National\nBiography I found the following entry :\nVeley, Margaret (1843-1887), novelist and poet : began\nto publish, 1870; issued 'For Percival,' her best novel,\n1878. .\nThe D.N.B. itself gives a fairly full biography and\nmentions the volume of her verse, A Marriage of Shadows,\npublished posthumously with a long biographical preface by\nLeslie Stephen. From these two books, anyone with a\nticket for the British Museum Reading Room and a spare\nhour can learn a great deal about her, from the foreign\nnationality of her grandfather to the name of her favourite\n\fno] Automatic Scripts by Margaret Veley. 283\ncat. There is a short notice of her in AUibone's Dictionary\nof English Literature, but this adds nothing to what is\nsaid in the D.N.B. Mr. George Moore in his Confessions\nof a Young Man (1926 Edn., pp. 169, 170) speaks of his\nfriendship with her, and her death.\nDuring the course of my enquiries I was fortunate\nenough to get into touch with several relatives of Margaret\nVeley, and friends of her family, to all of whom I wish to\nexpress my most cordial thanks for the help they have\ngiven. My obligation to them is increased by the fact\nthat, as they have very frankly said, they dislike any\ncanvassing of the possibility of their dead kinswoman and\nfriend having \"communicated\" through perfect strangers.\nThis is a feeling with which many will sympathise, but\ncases of supposed \" communication \" arise without our\nseeking them, and when they arise our Society has a duty\nto investigate them.\nFortunately in the present case there is no question of\ndisclosing matters which should be kept private : there is\nnothing particularly intimate in the statements made in\nthe scripts, and very little which has not already been\nrecorded in print elsewhere.\nThe scripts may therefore be discussed without any\ndisrespect to Margaret Veley's memory. Perhaps the\ndiscussion may help to revive interest in the works of a\ncharming but now neglected writer.\nIn the first part of this paper I shall set out the scripts\nin fuU,^ omitting the script verses, which can be de-\ntached without injury to their context ; Mr. V. has in-\ncorporated what he considers the best of these verses\nin Part II. of this paper. In a parallel column will be\nshown how far the statements in the scripts can be\nverified, and the source of verification. At the end of\n^ To avoid tediousness I have abbreviated the scripts shghtly in places\nwhere the \" communicator \" makes several shots at getting a name :\nin most cases the fact that abbreviation has been made is noted in\nbrackets. I have also omitted one short passage in which the \" com-\nmunicator \" makes a comment which might be offensive to persons now\nliving. Where no other source of verification is stated\u2014in the second\ncolumn headed \"Comment\"\u2014the source is one or other of the relatives\nand friends of Margaret Veley who have kindly given me information.\n\f284 W. H. Salter. [part\nthis part I shall discuss briefly two possible hypotheses\nas to the origin of the scripts, on which, as the investi-\ngator, I ought to state my own opinion.\nBut the more complete discussion of possible hypotheses\nwill be left to Mr. V. in the second part of the paper,\nwhere he will also compare the hterary style of the scripts\nwith that of Margaret Veley's published works. In view\nof Mr. F.'s great experience in psychical research, and\nhis wide knowledge of literature, there is no one better\nfitted to undertake this task.\n[Abbbeviations.\u2014D.N.B. = Dictionary of Natioyial Biography.

[PAR'I'\ninforms me that she has re-\nappeared at sittings for auto-\nmatic writing he has since had\nwith another lady.)\nIt will be convenient at this stage to state the extent of\nMr. F.'s normal knowledge of the matters mentioned in\nthe scripts, up to the time the scripts came to an end.\nMr. V. was brought up at Rochford, about 20 miles\nfrom Braintree, where he lived till he was twenty-four,\nand he now lives near Southend, a few miles further away.\nWhile at Rochford his parents took in the Essex Weekly\nNews, a local paper published at Chelmsford, which regu-\nlarly devotes a paragraph to Braintree news. Mr. V. was\nin the habit of glancing through this paper, but does not\nremember ever seeing in it any reference to any of the\nmatters mentioned in the scripts. The period his parents\ntook in the paper (1898 to 1914) was long after most of\nthe principal persons mentioned in the scripts were dead :\ntwo such persons, however, died during this period,\nEdward Holmes and Augustus Cunnington, and they\nreceived obituary notices in this paper (see pp. 321-322 for\nfurther discussion of this).\nAfter Mr. V. had asked me to look into the scripts, but\nbefore I had in fact made any enquiries, I put to him\nthe questions, which, with his answers to them, are set\nout below ; his answers are dated 2nd November, 1927 ;\nadditions in square brackets are by me :\n(1) Have you any normal Yes.

Mr. V. had\nnever seen the \" lonides Collection \" and did not know\nwhat it contained.\nMr. V. had never seen the Marriage of Shadows. He\ncannot recollect ever having seen the notice of Margaret\nVeley in the D.N.B., but he cannot be positive that it,\nor part of it, may not have caught his eye in looking up\nsome other reference in the same volume ; he cannot,\nhowever, remember ever looking at that particular volume.\nThis, he assures me, was to the best of his recollection\nthe sum total of his normal knowledge until after the\nscripts had ended.\nIn view of his having at one time seen the Essex Weekly\nNews, he and I agreed that, notwithstanding that the period\nduring which he read it w^as long after the deaths both of\nMargaret Veley and of most of the other people mentioned\nin the scripts, it would be w^ell to test how far the\ninformation to be found in that paper tallied with the\nstatements in the scripts, e.g. concerning Edward Holmes\nand his family, of whom much is said in the scripts and\npractically nothing in the Marriage of Shadoivs or the other\nyou visited Braintree 1 Harwich my company disen-\ntrained at Braintree and I passed\na couple of hours there. ^\n\f322 W. H. Salter. [part\nprinted sources from which I had checked the statements\nin the scripts. We accordingly met at Chehnsford on the\n3rd September, 1928, and went to the Essex Weekly News\noffice, where we looked up the files containing notices of\nthe deaths of Edward Holmes (1909) and Augu.stus Cunning-\nton (1902).\nI am satisfied that these notices have no bearing on the\nscripts. In the case of Edward Holmes, for instance,\nmention is made of some facts also stated in the scripts,\ne.g. his connection with the Literary and Mechanics'\nInstitution ; but the paper, while mentioning his interest\nin the public gardens, says nothing about his own garden\nand conserAratories about which the scripts are enthusiastic ;\nmoreover some interesting facts mentioned in the\npaper, e.g. his connection with the Volunteer movement,\nare not alluded to in the scripts. Incidentally, Margaret\nVeley is not mentioned in the obituary.\nIn view of the very slight correspondence between the\nscripts and the newspaper, as exemplified by these two\nobituary notices, I did not think I was called upon to\nhunt down all the possible Braintree references in all the\nother issues (say 830) of this paper which Mr. V. may have\ncasually glanced at in his early youth.\nOn the same day we also visited Braintree and saw the\ngraves of the Veley family in the cemetery ; also the\nchurch and the Great Square.\nIt will, I think, be generally agreed that the propor-\ntion of success to failure, as regards matters outside the\nadmitted normal knowledge of the automatists, is unusually\nhigh in these scripts, if they are compared with most\nostensibly spiritistic communications. The verifiable state-\nments (and the unverifiable residuum is very small) may be\nclassified under four heads, as follows :\n(A) Statements, whether volunteered by M. V. or made\nin reply to questions, which can be verified from the \\\nD.N.B. and the M.S.\n(B) Statements, whether volunteered or in reply to\nquestions, which can be verified from matter scattered up\nand down a considerable number of other books, e.g.\nvolumes of the County Directory.\n\f110] Automatic Scripts by Margaret Veley. 323\n(C) Statements volunteered as to matters which cannot\nbe verified from any printed source which I have been\nable to trace.\n^\n(D) Statements in reply to cjuestions regarding matters\nwhich cannot be verified from any such source.\nThe success is almost perfect under head (A) and the\nfailure almost complete under head (D). Under both\nheads (B) and (C) there is a mixture of success and\nfailure, with the successes largely preponderating.\nAs already stated, Mr. V. is contributing a critical\ndiscussion of the various hypotheses which may be framed\nto cover the facts of the case, and I am more than\ncontent to leave such a task in his very capable hands.\nThere are, however, two possible hypotheses on which, as\nthe verifier of the statements in the scripts, I ought to\nsay a few words.\nThe first possible hypothesis, and one that Mr. V.\n^ I here set out a list of the printed sources I have consulted :\nIndex to D.N.B. : Title\u2014Veley, Margaret.\nD.N.B. : Titles\u2014Veley, Margaret ;\nlonides, Constantine.\nA Marriage of Shadows (1888).\nConfessions of a Young Man, George Moore (1926 Edn., pp. 169, 170).\nOur Floating Home, Cyril lonides (1918).\nAllibone's Dictionary of English Literature : Title\u2014Veley, Margaret.\nTimes, 8th December, 1887.

H. Salter. [part\nwould be the last person to wish to have shirked, is that\nthe scripts are a conscious and deliberate fake on his\npart. That, I may say at once, is not my personal\nopinion.\nIt has often been observed, but it is well from time\nto time to emphasise the point, that in most mental\nphenomena it is the bona fides of the medium or auto-\nmatist or percipient that really matters. In some of the\nsimpler forms of experiment in telepathy and clairvoyance\nit is possible to exercise the same sort of control as can\nbe exercised at sittings for physical phenomena, but as\nregards any more complex mental phenomena this is\nimpracticable. In cross-correspondences, for example, the\nlength of time over which the phenomena extend, and the\nnumber of persons who, if their bona fides were not above\nsuspicion, would have to be regarded as potential con-\nspirators, make impracticable that kind of control. All\nproper precautions should of course be taken, as they are\nin the case of the S.P.R. cross-correspondences, in the way\ne.g. of getting original documents properly signed and\ndated ; such precautions are an indispensable safeguard\nagainst accidental mistakes arising from lapses of memory\nor other like causes ; but unless there is an absolute\nassurance on the point of character,^ all precautions how-\never elaborate are a snare and a delusion, the more\nelaborate the more delusive.\nMr. V. is known to all members of our Society, and\neven outside the wide limits of our membership, as one\nof the most active workers in the field of Psychical\nResearch. He is in addition personally well known to\nmany of us. Mrs. Sidgwick, who came into close touch\nwith him in connection with his \" Oscar Wilde \" scripts,\nwrites to me as follows :\nI had the pleasure of making Mr. V.'s acquaintance\nbefore you met him, I think. As you know, I reviewed in\nProceedings, vol. xxxiv, what had been published concerning\nthe Oscar Wilde script in which Mr. V. was one of the\n^ The character of the observers and reporters is, needless to say,\nequally roaterial with that of the medium or automatist.\n\f110] Automatic Scripts by Margaret Veley. 325\nautomatists. It is, I think, one of the most curious and\ninteresting cases of automatic writing we have come across\nin our investigations. While writing that review I had some\ncorrespondence with Mr. V. and we had a very long con-\nversation at the S.P.R. rooms, when he told me of various\ncurious impressions and experiences he had had. I formed\na high idea of his openmindedness, his really scientific\ninterest in the subject, his perception of what constituted\ngood evidence, and the trouble he was spontaneously\nwilling to take to make the evidence as good as possible.\nI think all of our members who know him will agree\nwith me that he is not the sort of man deliberately to\nfake phenomena, and, if this is a fake, it is a very elaborate\nand ingenious one.^\nMoreover, the internal evidence of the scripts corro-\nborates the evidence from character. While it is true\nthat on the tvJiole the proportion of success to failure\ndecreases as the scripts pass from matters to be found in\neasily accessible books into the region of intimate family\naffairs, this is only a very rough statement of the case.\nAttention has been called to several correct statements\nwhich I cannot find on record in print, but have only been\nable to verify by enquiries among friends and relatives of\nthe Veleys, who cannot suggest any printed sources of\nverification other than those I have already consulted.\nThe second hypothesis is that the M. V. of the scripts\nis the surviving personality of Margaret Veley who died\nm 1887.\nAmong the many peculiarities of the present case, by no\nmeans the least remarkable is that we have to do with\nan ostensible communicator whose \" communications \" only\nbegin forty years after her death. \" Communications\n\"\nhave indeed been received from persons of the remotest\nantiquity, compared with some of whom Mrs. Piper's\n\" Moses of Old \" is a mere parvenu, and some people, I\n1 As Mr. V. queries the appropriateness of the word \"ingenious\"\n(see p. 354 below) I should say that, on the hypothesis of conscious\nfraud, which I do not hold, some of the lapses of memory seem to me\nmost artistic. An unskilful faker might, e.g. have made M. V. remember\nthe name of the Defendant in the great Church-rate lawsuit.\n\f326 W. H. Salter. [part\nsuppose, take these things seriously. But such \" communi-\ncations \" as afford any reasonable evidence for survival\nusually purport to come from persons who begin to\n\" communicate \" within a few years of their death. We\nlack, therefore, any useful standard of comparison for the\nMargaret Veley case.\nIn weighing the evidence for identity afforded by\n\" communications \" from the recently dead, it is usual and\nreasonable to make some allowance for difficulties of\ncommunication ; an occasional mistake in matters of fact,\nwhich the \" communicator,\" if alive, would not have been\nlikely to make, may properly be disregarded. In the\nM. V. case the lapse of forty years since death justifies\nus in considerably enlarging this allowance. Margaret\nVeley, if she had been alive when the scripts were written,\nwould have been eighty-four years old, and her memory\nof her early life might be at fault on certain matters.\nA very substantial allowance for error must therefore be\ngranted M. V.\nThe fact that M. V. under cross-examination, so to\nspeak, cannot remember the names of old family retainers\nlike Mrs. Fish and the gardener Simon, should not condemn\nher off-hand, though many living people would probably\nagree that these are the sort of things which stay longest\nin the memory. We may even excuse lapses in state-\nments volunteered by M. V., e.g. that her sister Alice was\nolder than herself, when she was in fact younger. We\nmay strain a point and disregard M. V.'s cvirious inability\nto draw the relevant connection between facts correctly\nstated ; she remembers the cat Zoroaster ; she speaks of\nMr. Cunnington as a family friend ; she never at any time,\neven when questioned as to who gave her the cat and as\nto Mr. Cunnington's children, says \" By the bye, Mr.\nCunnington was not only a friend, but a first cousin of my\nfather, and it was his daughter who gave me the cat.\"\nBut, after all such allowances have been made, the\nonus of establishing identity rests with the \" communi-\ncator,\" whether recently dead, or dead for forty years, and\nthe question is, has M. V. discharged this onus ? Do the\nstatements in the scripts taken as a whole, and so far as\n\f110] Automatic Scripts by Margaret Veley. 327\nthey go beyond the automatists' normal knowledge, suggest\na continuity of memory, without which the word \" iden-\ntity \" would be meaningless ?\nIn my opinion they do not. The statements in the\nscript seem to me to consist of biographical dry bones, names\nof relatives and neighbours, dates of deaths, etc. ; the sort\nof thing that might be found in Who's Who. In addition,\nthere are a few more intimate details, either in their nature\nunverifiable, like the pony (62) and druggist's shop (52)\nincidents ; or all too easily verifiable from the biography in\nA Marriage of Shadows, as e.g. the name of her cat.\nFinally, there are a few statements which I have been\nable to verify from information supplied by surviving\nfriends, but not otherwise. The proportion of these is,\nhowever, very small. Let any of my readers of mature\nyears imagine himself giving reminiscences of the first\nforty years of his life at the length M. V. has done, and\ndecide whether he would in his own case have left the\ndry-bones of names, dates, etc., sticking out so nakedly.\nThe biographical matter in the scripts might, I think,\nfairly be entitled \" Margaret Veley and her circle seen from\nthe outside.\" A typical example of the failure to get an\ninside view-point is provided by the usage of the scripts\nas to diminutives of Christian names. M. V. calls her\nbrother-in-law, Edward Holmes, \" Teddy,\" an abbrevia-\ntion not in use in the family ; she calls his second wife\n\" Agnes \" although she was always known as \" Kate \" or\n\" Kitty.\" Most surprising, she never uses the diminutive\n\" Meggie \" by which Margaret Veley herself was always\nknown to her family and friends. This is all the more\nstriking as M. V. has, generally speaking, an easy way of\nbringing out names which many otherwise successful\n\" communicators \" might envy.\nThen there is the curious omission of all reference to\nMr. George Moore, although more than once (see notes\n15, 68, 72) questions were put to M. V. which might have\nbeen expected to revive memories of him. The perfection\nof her memory as to matters, sometimes very trivial\nmatters, stated in the D.N.B. and P.M.S., throws into\nstrong relief her silence as to a close friendship which\n\f328 W. H.

In fact, it is all most\nunlike her, in what is said and the way of saying it.\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 331\nPART II.\nBy Mr. V.\nTHE LITERARY STYLE OF THE SCRIPTS.\nIntroduction.\nWhen on 23rd May, 1927, I obtained by automatic writing a\nlittle poem above the signature of \" Margaret Veley \" the\nname seemed vaguely familiar. For some days I was at a\nloss, and then, led no doubt by the half-conscious workings\nof memory, I looked up an old volume of Harper's Monthly\nMagazine for the year 1881 which had been in my family\nfor at least 20 years. In the poetry index I soon found\nwhat I wanted. Opposite the name Margaret Veley was\nthe title of a poem called \" Almond Blossom,\" which was\nprinted in the August number of the same volume and\nillustrated by a full-page frontispiece depicting a youth\ndressed like an admiral, walking with a liigh-waisted girl\nin a wide-brimmed hat through a romantic wood. I had\nprobably read the poem on occasions previous to this, but\nI cannot remember that it had ever excited in me any\nspecial curiosity as to its author. It had struck me as\nbeing careful, Avell-knit verse, better, in fact, than half the\nloosely-constructed verse that is printed in magazines\nto-day.\nThe real Margaret Veley, her biographer, Leslie Stephen,\ntells us, took endless pains with her poetry, never resting\ntill she had found the word or epithet which exactly\nmatched the shade of her thought. Of the seven or eight\nautomatic poems signed Margaret Veley I estimate the\naverage rate of production to have been about three\noctasyllabic lines a minute. Rarely, indeed, were there any\ncorrections, and these when they occurred never amounted\nto more than the rectification of the obvious omission of\nsome single word. The verses, in fact, were written faster\nthan the average person would be able to transcribe them\n\f332 Mr. V. [part\nfrom a book. One cannot help wondering what Margaret\nVeley, that careful rider of Pegasus, would have thought\nif she could have had any premonition of this posthumous\nbolt. Whether or not there was a preliminary stage of\nsubconscious gestation I am unable to say, but at least\none incident occurred which, though it does not prove, at\nany rate suggests that certain of the poems may have been\nspontaneous productions.\nAt the third sitting on 12th July, just before the\nwriting began, Miss Hunt took down from the mantel-\npiece a flower-pot containing a species of pink rambler\nrose. A few minutes later, without hesitation or pause,\n\" Margaret \" wrote a poem about a rose that consisted of\nfourteen rather carefully finished octasyllabic couplets.\nThis jDoem she declared had been suggested to her by the\nsight of the rose. The verses are in the true sense of\nthe word \" automatic \" productions. They are not mere\ntranscriptions of words and imagery that well up rapidly\ninto the conscious mind. Nor, as in the case of Patience\nWorth, are they written to the dictation of an imperious\ninner voice. By concentrating my mind on some trivial\ncalculation I have learnt how to create a mental state of\nintense distraction, and it is during the moments when my\nmind is thus occupied that the writing is produced. The\nmoment my mind reverts to what my hand is supposed to\nbe doing the writing stops as suddenly as it commenced.\nIt is, however, impossible to maintain this mental attitude\nof complete abstraction for more than a very few minutes\nat a time, but a fresh effort of rapid concentration made at\nthe very moment when I feel my mind to be straying\nback will often enable the state to be renewed and the\nwriting prolonged without noticeable interruption. In\norder to aid concentration I invariably keep my eyes\nclosed while writing, and, if for no other reason than this,\nthe presence of a second person is always necessary to\nguide my hand when it reaches the end of a line. I can,\nindeed, obtain words and phrases of automatic writing when\nabsolutely alone, but the mere mechanical impediments\narising from the use of pencil and paper with eyes closed\nare always sufficient to break up rapidly my mental\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 333\nconcentration. Sitting alone I have never been able to\nproduce anything so sustained as a poem or even an odd\nstanza.\nBut there is no doubt in my mind that the person who\nassists me in these automatic ventures of mine fulfils\nmore than a mere mechanical function. Between my\npartner and myself I have never observed the kind of\ntelepathy that appears frequently to take place between\nmedium and sitter in spiritualistic seances, although I\nhave always been on the lookout for it. I have never\nnoticed that the intelligence writing through my hand\nshowed any knowledge of the secret thoughts of my\ncompanion or even of the latent content of her mind.\nMy partners assure me that they can find no connection\nbetween what is in their minds and what I write.\nIn spite of this I feel sure that the general tone of the\nliterary communications does depend in some subtle way\non the temperament and mental make-up of the person in\nwhose presence the writing is produced. The \" Oscar\nWilde \" who had been manifesting in the presence of\nMrs. Travers-Smith was not quite the same \" Oscar\nWilde \" as the one who turned up a few weeks later in\nthe company of Miss Helen McGregor. Not only did this\nlater \" Wilde \" talk about rather different things, but his\nprose, while still highly characteristic, seemed to have\nundergone a subtle change and to show signs of more\ncareful fabrication.\nEven the handwriting suddenly altered, growing smaller\nand more reminiscent of Wilde's fine Greek hand. [See\nPsychic Science, January 1924.]\nAnd the \" Wilde \" who appeared at the few sittings I\nhad with the lady I have called \" Mrs. L.\" showed him-\nself to be apter at repartee\u2014in fact, more of a conver-\nsationalist and less of an essayist than either of the other\ntwo Wildes.\nThese differences might be partly accounted for by\nautosuggestion, but I do not believe this to be the com-\nplete explanation.\nNot only does the second person appear to count for\nsomething in the general tone of the communications but\n\f334 Mr. V. [PART\nI am conscious that in the presence of certain people I\nshould be inhibited from getting any automatic writing at\nall. I hajopen to be peculiarly sensitive in other people\nto what Prof. James called the \" hidden wraith of per-\nsonality \" which lies beneath the exterior of each of us.\nIt is this Binnenleben or inner-feeling tone of which I\nam most acutely conscious when I meet a person for the\nfirst time and which impresses me more than either\nmanners or personal appearance. The thing may seem\nabsurd but I feel I must record it. I believe it is gener-\nally possible for me to judge beforehand of the hopefulness\nor otherwise of attempting automatic writing with a\nparticular individual.\nMargaret Veley's Verse.\nMargaret Veley, one of our undeservedly forgotten lesser\npoets, wrote verse during the 'seventies and the early and\nmiddle 'eighties of last century. In 1888, the year after\nher death, her collected poems appeared in a slender\nvolume entitled A Marriage of Shadows and Other Poems,\nand they were introduced by an extraordinarily full and\ndetailed biography from the pen of Leslie Stephen, an\nearly editor of the Dictionary of National Biography and a\npersonal friezid of Miss Veley. Many of the poems had\nbeen previously printed in magazines like Harper's New\nMonthly and The Century.\nPervaded by a faint sophisticated melancholy, this verse\nleaves one just a little too conscious of the labour that\nmust have gone to its making. But though the verse\nshows signs of careful workmanship it is neither aifected\nnor insincere. Like so many others who lived in the clos-\ning decades of the century Margaret Veley was profoundly\ninfluenced by the disillusion, the religious doubt and loss\nof simple faith that were natural consequences of the\nnew vistas opened up by science with regard to the pro-\nbable evolution of Man's life on the planet.\nPoetry for Margaret Veley was rather a stepping-stone\nin her search for a personal philosophy than the medium\nthrough which she could record the reactions of her spirit to\nsensuous beauty. In her longer poems are many musings,\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 335\nmany tranquil meditations on death and human destiny.\nAnd she put these preoccupations into verse that is some-\ntimes as placid and unruffled as the mill-ponds that lie in\nthe quiet meadows around her Braintree home. But her\nmonodies on death are hardly ever morbid. She does not,\nlike Blair, see a churchyard and a delving sexton round\nevery corner, or like Maeterlinck scare herself into shudders\nover the unknown terrors that may be lying in wait\noutside the gates of life. She is much too sane for that.\nShe sees Death watching above the revelry of life, \" sitting\nwith a quiet face \" ; but being, like Keats' \" Meg,\" brave\nas \" Margaret Queen,\" she greets Death, if not with a\nsmile, at least with a note of frank interrogation, and also\nwe may be sure with the politeness to be expected from a\nVictorian gentlewoman.\nBut it seems she gets little change out of the old\nfellow. It is Margaret Veley who does all the talking\n;\nand when she has finished, Death is still \"sitting there\nwith the quiet face.\"\nBut her personal philosophy is a brave one, and in some\nrespects almost an anticipation of the one that Mr.\nBertrand Russell has given us in his fine essay, A Free\nMan's Worship. Only there is more poetry in Mr. Russell's\nessay than in Margaret Veley's verse. This is from A\nMarriage of Shacloivs :\nMust all our life be quenched ? It may be so.\nIt may be so. Yet can it change my cry ?\nLet the last man be nobler far than I.\nThough I am dead, though he shall surely die.\nIt may be so. Yet who can tell the height.\nThe joy, the white perfection of the light\nHe may attain before the coming night.\nWho knows what clearer vision there shall be\nIn the great days that I shall never see ?\nShall not this hope be hope enough for me ?\nThough there may be no personal immortality, though\neven the race itself is doomed to perish in the eventual\nnight, she will continue to fling her challenge of life\ntriumphant into the face of Death,\n\f336 Mr. V. [part\nYet will I scorn thee\u2014scorn all craven fears,\nFlinging on high my handful of salt tears,\nTo flash in lucid sunlight as I die,\nAnd Death, if it be Death, will I defy.\n[A Dream of Life and Death.]\nBut she reflects it is easy enough to keep up . one's\nspirits when one is young, but how will it be when old\nage comes on ? Will her faith stand the strain ?\nBut if I thus believe why fear old age ?\nWhy not pass boldly through the mocking mist\nIn full assurance of eternal youth\nAnd of the final triumph of the sun ?\nAh ! but my faith is like the sun itself\n\u2014\nNo little talisman to have and hold\nAnd grasp more tightly when the shadows come :\nBut a mysterious majesty of light\nAcross whose glory billows of black cloud\nDrive and the sudden darkness is astir\nWith wavering of fantastic shajies of doubt.\nUnto the very verge of death we go\nWith those who die. ...\nAnd so there is a shadow on the end.\n[A Shadow on the Dial.]\nIt was not Death itself but the Death in Life of old\nage that Margaret Veley feared. But she need not have\nworried. Whatever gods there be decreed that she should\nbe cut off in early middle age, actively engaged in her\nlast novel, which I believe was never published.\nOne could hardly expect a Margaret Veley, who had\nsurvived Death for forty years to continue writing about\nit in the same strain. Such a phenomenon if it occurred\nwould suggest the resuscitation of a past Margaret rather\nthan a Margaret who had actively survived and developed\nin a new life.\nIt is perhaps just a little strange that nowhere in her\nscript does M. V. make the slightest reference to these old\npreoccupations of her earthly life.\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 337\nThere is indeed one little poem on Death that occurs\nin the automatic script, but this is written in a natura-\nlistic manner that is in no way reminiscent of any of the\nreal Margaret Veley's published verse. The verses that\nfollow were written on the 2nd November, 1927.\nCome let us lay a wreath\nOn the quiet brows of Death. .\nFor Death no flowers hath\n'\nNor any rose sweet-smelling ; .\nCold grief alone he hath\nAnd tears beyond all telling. ,\nSo we'll build a rose-path\nRight round the roof-garden\nOf his lone damp dwelling.\nCome let us pipe a song :\nTo cheer Death's way along ;\nFor Death no music hath\nBut the wind in the swathe ;\nOr the quiet mossy tread\nOf footsteps overhead.\nO oft-times he\nHas sorry company\nWhen witless worms carouse\nWithin his silent house.\nDeath learns no news of Spring.\nHe knows not night from day.\nSo on his low door-sill\nLet a kind wren sing\nTo while dark hours away.\nI . (Signed) Margaret Veley.\nSince much of the automatic verse is of the sort that is\ncommonly known to-day as \" Nature Poetry \" it will be\nnecessary for us to examine Margaret Veley's own attitude\ntowards Nature. I think I should be right in saying that\nMargaret Veley never wrote verse for the sake of express-\ning her intimate feelings about landscaj)e. When she\nwrote about Nature she did so in a way that was almost\nconventional and always incidental to her true concerns\n\f338 Mr. V. [part\nwhich were human beings and their destiny. Tennyson\ncould write\n\" And only through the faded leaf\nThe chestnut pattering to the ground,\"\nand his disciple, Richard Dixon, of\n\" The diamond drip of a white wing upon\nA lake struck dead with shadows,\"\nbut Margaret Veley never saw Nature with this delicate\nintensive observation. She was content to use the\nlanguage of the precursors of the Romantic Revival. The\n\" peaceful plains,\" \" the everlasting hills,\" \" the groves and\nlawns,\" \" the bowers,\" \" the mossy fountains,\" \" the\nlaughing rills,\" \" the ripened grain \"\u2014all the well-worn\npieces of the pre-romantic currency are to be found in her\nverse, and sometimes the old coins ring a little thin.\nHere is a typical specimen :\nA land of sunny turf and laughing rills,\nA land of endless summer sweet with dew,\nGirt with a range of everlasting hills\nAsleep beneath a sky of Avhite and blue.\nThere with a silver flash mid grove and lawn\nLike curving blades are thrust the narrow creeks,\nAnd ocean breezes rise at dusk and dawn\nWith songs of freedom round the guardian peaks.\nIn sparkling air the poplars quiver high\nIn every thicket sing the birds unseen.\nO'er sculptured walls beneath the glowing sky\nFruits cluster purple rijae and waters lie\nLucid in fountains rimmed with mossy green.\n[The Level Larid.]\n\" Creeks like curving blades \" is good, but \" the guardian\npeaks \" seem to have been introduced into the landscape\nbecause the creeks were already there and they afford an\nobvious rhyme. Indeed, almost the whole of this passage\ncould be re-written in simple prose without very much loss\nor gain in poetic quality. You do not make poetry by\nironing out rather commonplace observations into smooth\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 339\npentameters. When the diction is undistinguished, as it is\nhere, there must be some compensation in the way of\nrhythmic life or metrical subtlety.\nBut in impassioned moments of melancholy meditation\nMargaret Veley sometimes strikes on a fine image. Here\nare six lines from \" A Shadow on the Dial \" that convey\nthe real thrill of poetry :\nFor Death is great, inscrutable, alone,\nCommon to all, but never commonplace.\nIt overhangs our dull and hackneyed lives\nAs the grey silence of an endless clifi\nSheer to the flood and towering to the sky\nDefies and dominates a waste of waves.\nMargaret Veley seems to have had a natural preference\nfor five-stressed lines, but she wrote also a certain amount\nof hej)tasyliable verse in a distinct trochaic metre. All the\nverse purporting to come from her spirit has either four\nor three stresses to the line, and the metre is invariably\niambic.\nAny notice of Margaret Veley's poetry would be incom-\nplete without a quotation from her most remarkable effort,\n\" A Japanese Fan,\" first pubhshed in A Marriage of\nShadows. It is not a great poem or even a poem with\ngreat moments ; but it is unlike anything else she ever\nwrote, and it is instinct with such a vivid sense of\narrested life that as we read it to-day we feel as if the\npassing moments of one thundery day in the 'seventies\nhad been caught and petrified for the inspection of some\nlater age. The poetic form is for Margaret Veley's day\nunusual, and the free almost conversational rhythm serves\nto sustain and accentuate the undertones of gentle but\ngrim irony that run beneath the forced vivacity. I quote\nthe first forty-four lines.\nHow time flies ! Have we been talking\nFor an hour 1\nHave we been so long imprisoned\nBy the shower\nIn this old oak-panelled parlour ?\nIs it noon ?\n\fMr. V.\nDon't you think the rain is over\nRather soon 1\nSince the heavy drops surprised us\nAnd we fled\nHere for shelter while it darkened\nOverhead.\nSince we leaned against the window\nSaw the flash\nOf the lightning, heard the rolling\nThundercrash ;\nYou have looked at all the treasures\nGathered here\nOut of days and countries\nFar and near ;\nAt those glasses thin as bubbles\nOpal bright\nAt the carved and slender chessmen\nRed and white,\nAt the long arra}' of china\nCups and jalates\n\u2014\nDo you really understand them\nNames and dates ?\nAt the tapestry where dingy\nShepherds stand\nHolding grim and faded damsels\nBy the hand.\nAll the while my thoughts were busy\nWith the fan\nLying here, bamboo and paper\nFrom Japan.\nIt is nothing ;\nvery common\nBe it so.\nDo you wonder why I prize it\nCare to know ?\nShall I teach you all the meaning,\nThe romance,\nOf the i^icture you are scorning\nWith a glance ?\n\fno] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 341\nCOMPAEISON AVITH THE SCRIPT VeRSES.\nTo discover the essential differences in diction between\nMargaret Veley's verse and tlie \" spirit verse \" we need\nonly contrast a few stanzas of Margaret Veley's \" Spring\n\"\nwith the automatic poem \" April Storm \" written on\n22nd December, 1927.\nHere are the first three stanzas of \" Spring,\" the work\nof the real Margaret Veley :\nJust a tiny blue-eyed maid\nNewly out of Eden strayed ;\nLips a bud, rose-tinted rare\nAnd the sunlight in her hair.\nHere is Spring !\nLeaves are few to make her bowers,\nBunches bright of leafless flowers\nAre by baby fingers placed\nSide by side in happy haste.\nLittle Spring !\nGardens dark with winter gloom\nAll at once begin to bloom,\nBudding branches lifted high\nLaugh and whisper in the sky.\nWelcome Spring !\n[From A Marriage of Shadoics.]\nAnd here is the \" spirit \" poem, written in the presence\nof Miss Hunt on 22nd December, 1927.\nAPRIL STORM.\nBeneath this April storm Spring stirs\nBut hardly and with pain ;\nUnwelcomed by the sun the buds\nBreak into green again.\nSpring stirs, but earth lies wrapped about\nWith clouds and wmdy rain.\nThese are no tears wept softly down\n\u2022\nUnto a patient earth,\n\f342 Mr. V.\nThat meekly drinks their drops and sees\nThe lightly chasing mirth\nOf April follow down the wind,\nHer grief of little worth.\nScarcely a blue and sudden gleam\nParts clouds of drifting grey ;\nThe flickering fearful sunbeam comes\nBut seldom here to stray\nHis timid glance upon the fields\nWhere the blown grasses sway.\nLate in the sullen afternoon\nBlue livid clouds grow chill ;\nMoved in the low unkindly heavens\nBy winds unkindlier still ;\nAnd trees like spattered purple ink\nSprawl darkly on the hill.\nThere comes a sudden dash of rain\nThat coldly stings the face ;\nNow all the wavering drops whirl on\nAt the swift tempest pace ;\nWhile in the field wet flying gusts\nSwoop down through leagues of space. .\nAnd yet the tender leaves put forth\nBrave hearts beside the way ;\nFor there is sap that mounts and sings\nIn tree and hedge to-day ;\nAnd silken buds of willow-palms\nFlash green and silver-grey.\nSo blows the wind or beats the rain\nWith scarce a ray between ;\nBut there is joy in hearts of men\nWho other Springs have seen ;\nFor low beneath heaven's folded cloud\nThe world is growing green.\n[Signed M. Veley.]\nMargaret Veley's poem has a captivating and winsome\nrhythm, but in it we miss I think some of the true and\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 343\ntender observation there is in the spirit poem. Whoever\nwrote the spirit poem, he or she had at any rate actually\nobserved a stormy April day and was not merely echoing\nwhat dead poets have said about April. I do not think\nthe living Margaret Veley would have written the script\npoem. It remains on too objective a level. Margaret\nVeley could not have written so many verses without\nallowing her personal melancholy to appear. Even the\n\" Spring \" poem which begins objectively enough becomes\nsubjective in tone after the three stanzas quoted.\nMoreover, Margaret Veley's four-stress verse has generally\na distinct falling cadence, while a feature of the spirit\nverse is an evenness of iambic movement with a pre-\ndilection for rising cadences.\nMoreover, I doubt if the living Margaret Veley would\nhave introduced such specific detail as \" silken buds of\nwillow palms \" or \" trees like spattered purple ink.\" She\nwas generally content with the almost Chaucerian sim-\nplicities of \" leafless flowers,\" \" budding branches,\" \" sap-\nless leaf and stem.\"\nAs regards vocabulary, the differences between the two\npoets are perhaps not very remarkable, but I have come\nacross individual words such as \" lucid \" which the living\nMargaret Veley frequently used but which occur nowhere\nin the script verse.\nThe word \" unkindly \" which occurs in this script poem\ndoes not seem to have been one of Margaret Veley's\nwords. And I am quite certain she would never have\nreferred to the \" roof-garden of a grave.\" [See p. 337.]\nProbably many spiritualists will argue that such super-\nfine criticism is beside the mark when it is a question of\na poet who has been dead forty years. Forty years !\nWhy in that time she might have developed into an\nEdith Sitwell or a Rose Macaulay, or at least a Miss\nSackville-West. But if you asked me just what kind of\npoetry I should expect Margaret Veley to write after\nforty years of evolution in the \" spheres \" I should be\ncompletely nonplussed.\nAccording to orthodox spiritualist tradition one ought I\nsuppose, to expect a vers litre or at best a very free blank\n\f344 Mr. V. [part\nverse. The sentiment would consist of lofty but rather\nboring moral platitudes, or perhaps of a nebulous mysticism\nstriving feebly to penetrate a cloud of coloured words.\nBut of two things we might be fairly certain : whatever\nthe sentiment of the verse it would have no rhymes and\nno regular stanzas.\nSetting aside the numerous sorry Shelleys and garrulous,\ninglorious Miltons that have provided poor enough sport\neven for the spiritualists themselves, there are on record\nfew really interesting cases in which literary ghosts have\nbeen raised a quarter of a century or more after their\ndeaths. Perhaps one of the most intriguing was the\nspirit return of Oscar Wilde in 1923 after a sojourn of\ntwenty-three years in what (if we are to believe the\nunhappy author's own account) must have been the least\ndelectable regions of Hades. This soi-disant Wilde, who\ncontinued to write through my hand for several weeks,\nreproduced not only the salient features of his mundane\ncalligraphy\u2014a feat that seems almost inexplicable on any\npsychological theory of the soul\u2014but in addition all his\negotism, most of his literary mannerisms and an occasional\nflash of his old wit and fire. Indeed, after nearly a\nquarter of a century of stagnation in what Sir A. Conan\nDoyle calls \" the grey spheres \" Wilde was still capable of\nproducing a style equal to his earthly worst, and in the\nMcGregor scripts even recovered his second best.\nHe made no attempts to write poetry, it is true, but\nhe was no great hand at that on earth. When we\nremember what a fluent capacity the resurrected Wilde\nshowed for writing imitations of himself, and sometimes\nbad ones at that, it seems at first sight curious that the\nspirit poems of Margaret Veley should be so entirely unlike\nthose of the living authoress. But the anterior circum-\nstances were widely difl^erent in the two cases. Before\nthe Oscar Wilde scripts were produced I had read De\nProfundis, The Picture of Dorian Grey, and the Ballad\nof Reading Gaol\u2014three works which contain a good deal\nof the quintessence of Wilde. There probably existed\ntherefore sufficient well-assimilated material in my memory\nout of which my own subconscious activity could recon-\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 345\nstruct\u2014or if you are a spiritualist\u2014out of which the spirit\nof Oscar Wilde could reconstruct a very tolerable imitation\nof the dead author's prose style. But I am morally certain\nthat besides the poem \" Almond Blossom,\" which by the\nway bears no signature in Harper's Magazine, I had read\nnothing of Margaret Veley's at the time I received the\nmessages.\nNowadays even the most ardent and advanced spiritualists\nare being compelled to admit that if the dead can com-\nmunicate with the living they probably make use of\nmaterial that is in the memories of the living. To permit\noneself the dangerous licence of a metaphor, one might\nsay that the spirit of Wilde found in my mind a well-\ntilled field in which to sow his seeds of style, while\nMargaret Veley found only a barren and stony ground.\nBut there is another consideration that must be given\ndue weight. All who have had considerable practical\nexperience of spirituahstic phenomena will know that if\na psychic circle expressly concentrates its attention on\ngetting some particular sort of manifestation the psychic\nenergy seems to be diverted gradually into the desired\nchannel, and the chosen manifestation will continue to\ndevelop at the expense of other rudimentary phenomena,\nwhich will be suppressed or at least clipped in their\ngrowth.\nNow most of the Oscar Wilde scripts were produced in\nthe general literary atmosphere of Mrs. Travers-Smith's\nChelsea drawing-room. The conversation turned naturally\non books and authors, and the people present were usually\npersons like Miss Oummins, with literary inclinations, who\nshowed the hvehest interest in all that the so-called Wilde\nwrote. We did not strain after mere facts. Wilde was\nnever pestered to give the name of his favourite horse\nor of the butler at Tite Street. When he \" descended\ninto the dull abyss of facts \" he did so of his own free-\nwill and under no pressure from us. In fact, our really\nstrong interest in him was literary and not biographical,\nand so long as the experiment lasted we let this soi-\ndisant Wilde develop for what he was worth as a literary\npersonality. And there is much to be said in favour of\nz\n\f346 Mr. V. [part\nthis attitude when dealing with literary ghosts. The\nstudy of subconscious literary creation is in itself a legi-\ntimate subject for psychic investigation, and one that is\nat least as fascinating as telepathy or clairvoyance. Only\nthe earth-worms of psychic research will argue otherwise.\nFrom the literary point of view I think it is possible\nthat we lost a good deal by not giving the spirit of\nMargaret Veley more encouragement. Perhaps for a\nliterary ghost we put her through too severe and too con-\nstant a catechism. Miss Hunt was sympathy and patience\nthemselves, but between us I fancy we just failed somehow\nto provide the right atmosphere for the genial nurture\nof a rather shy poetic shade. If we had relaxed a little\nthe tension of the sittings, and been less assiduous in inter-\nrogating M. V. on her family and connections, it is pro-\nbable that Mr. Salter would have been provided with a\nsmaller budget of facts, but that on the other hand the\nliterary developments might have more than compensated\nfor the loss.\nNothing, I feel, would be gained by printing here ^ the\nwhole of M. V.'s script verses.\nEnough to say that this verse is invariably melodious\nand well finished and charming in sentiment even though\nit does not reach a high imaginative level. And in the\nwhole of it I have been unable to discover even slight\nindications that might lead one to suspect that the \"real\"\nMargaret Veley had any hand in it. A specimen or two\nwill suffice.\nThe little poem which follows is the one by which the\nspirit M. V. first intimated her presence at the initial\nsitting on 22nd May, 1927. The form is here not alto-\ngether inappropriate to the mood.\nSUNSET STREET.\nAcross the gardens to the sun,\nWhen westward skies enthrone the sun,\nI gaze, and lo ! the gilding falls\nWith kindling strangeness on the walls.\n^ A complete copy of the M.V. verses is filed at the rooms of the\nSociety.\n\f110] _\nThe Literary Style of the Scripts. 347\nA magic's loosed upon the street,\nAnd the last gables of the street,\nShine more remote, and now to me\nSpeak of a nobler masonry.\nI seize the last good gift of day,\nSm-prise the bounty of the day ;\nI make my rare, kind truce with Fate,\nAnd Here and Now obliterate.\nAppropriate to me is this Time,\nI'm sovereign mistress of this Time,\nAnd Space has slipped its cable slack\n\u2014\nThe world's width's mine for gazing back.\nGraciously stand the minarets\nLight-garmented ; those minarets\nHave talked with Time ; that turret's edge\nDespoils the sun of one bright wedge.\nThe sun-kissed stairways spire and climb.\nHow airily they spire and climb !\nBeheld in beauty from their height\nAll the long city lies in light.\nYon roof's a garden, leafed and flowered.\nWith pinli and purple bells 'tis flowered.\nAnd tunefully they're wont to swing\nOn the gold fringe of evening.\nHear now ! a fragment of the chime\nMinute and silver-lipping chime !\nAnd perfumes wajnvard on my face\nMake sweet this lapse of Time and Space.\nO land far-off from every day !\nO Age long-lost to every day :\n0 vanquished leagues ! 0 captured hour !\nThe sun has clipped behind the tower.\nThe sun has dipped behind the roof,\nBehind Rose Villa's gabled roof,\nAnd the last chimney-pot goes gray,\nA hundred sober yards away.\n(Signed) Margaret Veley.\n\f348 Mr. V. [part\nCertain of the unfinished fragments are perhaps more\ninteresting than the completed efforts. I cite two ex-\namples. The first was written on 20th January, 1928, in\nthe presence of Miss Hunt.\nTHE GARDEN.\nIn a corner close-embowered\nWhere green boughs dip and shade,\nWhere flakes of light are showered\nAnd a peace of leaves is made.\nSomewhere a child in a garden\nThe flower of joy in her hands\nStood near those other garden gates\nThat open in unknown lands.\nThrough musk and scent of roses . . .\n(Unfinished.)\nThe second fragment is interesting as being the sole\nexample of \"Margaret Veley \" verse written in the presence\nof a person other than Miss Hunt. After the middle of\nFebruary, 1928, Miss Hunt was unable to co-operate any\nlonger and the M. V. sittings came to an end. I did not\nresume automatic writing till the following May, when I\nhad one sitting in the presence of Mrs. Mackenzie at\nNo. 2 Adelaide Road. At this sitting the new communi-\ncator Mr. \" X \" manifested but not Margaret Veley. On\nOctober 10th however I had my second sitting with Mrs.\nMackenzie, and at this sitting in addition to Mr. \" X \"\nthe \" spirit \" of M. V. paid us a flying visit as unexpected\nas it was brief.\nHaving announced her presence by signing her name\nM. V. wrote a couple of stanzas of a poem called \" The\nRiver,\" the first stanza being very confused and almost\nillegible. But the second stanza suggests that under hap-\npier conditions the poem would have been a charming one :\nRosebay and rush and reed-feather\nAt its sweet selvedge clustering,\nWhile summer's luring finger-tips\nDraw bloom down to its laughing lips ;\n\fno] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 340\nMirror of crystal shows !\nAnd for its robes' best fashioning\nAs for the raiment of a king\nThe flag-flower a purple blazon sews.\nThe Prose Style of the Scripts.\nMargaret Veley's novels are stamped with a date. Her\npoetry has an individual note, a faint characteristic vibra-\ntion, but none of those great original qualities that will\ncause the verses of Edward Thomas and of W. H. Davies\nto be rediscovered and read again and again in the ages\nto come. Margaret Veley's poetry is an echo with a\npersonal ring, but still only an echo. But while few\nnowadays would care to wade through her novels or read\nmuch of her verse, there remain a few passages culled\nfrom the letters she left that reveal a humour that is as\nfresh and sparkling in 1928 as it was in 1888. One could\nwish that Leslie Stephen had preserved for us more of\nthis quiet ii'onic fun. Miss Jane Doe writes much in the\nsame vein to-day. I Mali cite one or two examples. On\none occasion Margaret Veley seems to have felt uncom-\nfortable at having used the poetically commonplace flowers\nof amaranth and asphodel, and she looks them up in a\nFrench dictionary. In a letter she writes :\nAnd they said that amaranth was \" Love lies bleeding,\"\n\" Prince's Feather,\" etc. Could Milton's angels be crowned\nwith that ? I attacked a book in thirty-six volumes on\nEnglish Botany and hunted up a wild amaranth. Milton's\namaranth, if I remember rightly, grows \"hard by the tree\nof life,\" but the description of my wild amaranth began,\n\" This dunghill plant grows chiefly in the neighbourhood\nof London.\"\nShe is reminded of \" Moly,\" of which she used to read\nin Pope's Odyssey, and looks it up for old acquaintance\nsake :\nHorror ! The four authorities I consulted were all\nunanimous. It is a wild garlic with yellow flowers ! After\nthat\u2014I can but hope the Lotus eaters lay very still ; for\nthe only wild garlic I know if crushed\u2014\n\f350 Mr. V. [PAET\nAsphodel is better but it was a shock to me to learn\nthat it has a nutritive and medicinal root shaped like a\nj\nsmall turnip.\nThis passage concerning \" Moly \" is interesting in con-\nnection with one of Mr. Salter's test questions and I shall\nrefer to it later.\nMargaret Veley was rather fond of playing on words.\nOf the cat Zoroaster she writes :\nAs for Zo he is simply and literally \" the desolator \" aa\nByron puts it. When I was planting out seedling asters\nthe other evening in a hurry because the light was failing\nhe said quite distinctly \" A Zoroaster is better than a\nChina-aster any day \" and proceeded to plant himself in\nevery hole in turn. Being with difficulty uprooted he\nclimbed and bounced about till the next hole was ready.\nHere is her analysis of this same garden :\n\" There are,\" she writes, \"in 100 parts\nStones (say) 76\nPotsherds, brickbats, bones\nbits of glass and a rusty iron bar\nWorms, grubs, etc. 7\nBits of Newspaper and various\nrubbish always mysteriously arriving\nabout\nIf you add it up you'll find it comes to just 100 :\n\u2014no it\ndoesn't, it comes to 99. What little trifle have I forgotten ?\nWell it can't much matter can it ? Oh ! but I have it\n:\nEarth:\u2014\n1\nAnd there you are !\n\"\nThere is little enough of this humour in the scripts,\nwhich are, except for the poems, devoid of either grace or\nstyle, being for the most part simply bare unentertaining\nlists of facts, names of family connections, etc.\nIn this barren desert there is one and only one little\noasis which might lead one to believe that with proper\nencouragement the \" spirit \" Margaret might in time have\ndeveloped a sense of fun not entirely unlike what is\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 351\nrevealed by the letters of the real Margaret. On 12th\nOctober, 1927, Miss Hunt being present, M. V. wrote :\nI suppose I am very much of a back number hy now.\nI often think of my six novels. They must now be\nmouldering in our national libraries with the rest of the\nfruit of dead men's brains.\nDo they ever dust them I wonder ? No doubt the\nworms have made many a meal off the works of M. Veley.\nWhat are the wild worms saying Margaret ? However as\nmy books must have bored so many readers it is only\nright that they should end in being bored also. Do the\nlittle worms prefer our old-fashioned paper to your modem\nwood-pulp ?\nIt is only a gleam, but there seems to be here a\ntendency to play on words rather reminiscent of the\n\" Zoroaster \" passage quoted above.\nOne may indeed question if Margaret Veley in her life-\ntime would have referred to herself as a back-number as\nshe was somewhat of a purist in her English. In another\nscript she calls herself a \" Britisher.\" At the time when\nMargaret Veley wrote there appears to have been a\nprejudice in literary circles against the use of this word\nwhich was an importation from America.\nBut if Margaret Veley, who admits that this was not the\nfirst spiritualistic seance she has visited, is in sufficiently\nclose touch with the living to be able to reply to their\nspoken words by automatic writing have we any right to\nsuppose that her vocabulary would remain what it was in\n1887 ? Oscar Wilde claimed to have read the novels of\nArnold Bennett through twentieth centmry eyes, and he\neven criticised them rather amusingly if somewhat caustic-\nally according to his old canons of aesthetic creed. Why\nshould not a surviving Margaret Veley in contact with the\nliving have picked up fresh phrases during the years just\nas we do ourselves ?\nIndeed, if what survives the death of the body is a\ntrue mind, with all its capacities for development and\nadaptation, we might well expect to find that after forty\nyears' sojourn in a new environment this mind had\n\f352 Mr. V. [part\nchanged out of all recognition so far as its faculties and\nmental content are concerned. We ought not to be\nsurprised if we find it as difficult to identify by purely\nmental traits a posthumous M. V. of 1927 with the old\nM. V. of 1887 as it would be for us to discover the boy\nof six in the grown man of forty-six. In the last case,\napart from such purely physical permanences as birth-marks\nor finger-prints, we should have to rely upon a few uncer-\ntain childish memories as the sole material for identifica-\ntion.\nOn the other hand, what survives death may not be, as\nthe spiritualists believe, a real mind, but only a timeless\ncomponent of the old mind which is captured and revital-\nised into a sort of temporary new mind by the nervous\nsystem of the automatist. In this case we might expect\nthe new mind to exhibit certain characteristics of the old,\nbut these would l^e modified by the fusion of the surviving\ncomponents with the new organism.\nUnfortunately our ignorance of the real nature of the\nsurviving components of human minds makes it at present\nimpossible for us to determine just what qualities of the\nold mind we should expect the new compound mind to\nexhibit.\nIs this surviving entity to be identified, for instance,\nwith the \" Pure Memory \" of Bergson, which persists but\nis unable to realise itself as consciousness except when\nfused with the perceptions of a living organism ? And, if\nso, would such personal traits as handwriting, word\nhabits, facial gestures, vocal characteristics, etc., which\nwould seem to depend largely upon mechanisms built up\ninside the nervous system, perish utterly with the old\norganism ? Yet we know that many sitters claim to\nrecognise the physical idiosyncrasies of deceased relatives\nin the gestures of an entranced medium.\nIn the Margaret Veley scripts the handwriting seems\nindistinguishable from my own, but in the scripts of Oscar\nWilde the writing bears an indisputable resemblance to\nthat of the living author. But I should deny emphatic-\nally that it was a rejilica of Wilde's own handwriting.\nWhen I come to examine it it seems to be rather my own\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 353\nhandwriting modified by the introduction of Wildean\ncharacteristics. It is, in fact, my own handwriting dis-\nguised by such devices as the breaking up of individual\nwords, the substitution of Greek u's for a's and Wildean\nr's and f's for my own r's and f's.\nHandwriting is undoubtedly a bodily habit, but it is\nnevertheless probable that there is associated with it an\nelement of what Bergson calls \" Pure Memory.\" The\nmere fact that we are able to recognise other people's\nhandwriting when we see it shows that we retain a\nmemory of handwriting that is different from the mere\nautomatic memory of the nervous mechanism which\nreproduces it.\nIf this spiritual memory is part of the surviving com-\nponent of mind we might expect the handwritings of\nautomatic scripts to bear certain resemblances to those of\nthe living personalities without being in any sense exact\nreplicas.\nThe real difficulty is to explain why characteristics of\nthe handwriting of Wilde are reproduced and no such\ncharacteristics in the case of Margaret Veley by one and\nthe same automatist.\nReproduction of handwriting is, however, a very rare\nphenomenon in the history of automatism.\nThere is indeed the classical case of Mrs. Thompson who\nreproduced in her trance handwriting which bore a re-\nmarkable resemblance to that of the late Prof. Henry\nSidgwick. It was pointed out however by Mr. Piddington\n[Proceedings, vol. xviii.] that there was no reasonable cer-\ntainty that the medium had not previously seen a speci-\nmen of Prof. Sidgwick's handwriting. In this connection\nMr. Piddington mentions his own capacity for vivid\nvisualization during dreams of the handwriting of various\nfriends and conjectures that this faculty may be even\nmore active in the mediumistic trance.\nSuch considerations might tempt one to suppose that\nsometime in the year 1914 I had casually glanced at the\nCountess de Breremont's Oscar Wilde, a book that was\nrather prominently displayed on the bookstalls of that\ntime and which contains a facsimile letter of Wilde's,\n\f364 Mr. V. [part\nwere it not for the fact that the later 0. W. scripts\ncontain certain calligraphic details such as the \" looped \" f\nwhich do not appear in this specimen. It is not\ntherefore easy to dispose of the handwriting in the Wilde\nscript as an example of cryptomnesia, and the mystery\nremains.\nHypotheses.\n\/. The Hypothesis of Conscious Fraud.\nAt the end of his paper Mr. Salter expresses the opinion\nthat if the scripts are a fake then they are an elaborate\nand ingenious fake. Elaborate the fake would certainly be\nin this respect that the faker must have spent a great\ndeal of time in ferretting out the various bits of informa-\ntion, but I can hardly admit that it merits the word\n\" ingenious.\" Indeed, I am frightened to think how much\nmore effectively the thing could have been done by a\nforger who set about the business in a systematic way.\nHow these dull scripts could have been enlivened with\nlocal colour by means of a judicious and discreet question-\ning of unsuspecting old Braintree residents, some of whom\nwould almost certainly have known Margaret Veley in\ntheir youth. Then it seems scarcely credible that a faker\nwho can presumably write verse should refrain from\nsetting himself the easy exercise of imitating Margaret\nVeley's unaffected pentameters. And when he started to\ncollect information one would imagine that the clever faker\nwould certainly make a point of visiting the Veley tomb-\nstones in Braintree cemetety and of noting carefully what\nwas inscribed on each of them. And, having done so, he\nwould have been well primed with the Christian names of\nAlice Holmes' second son who died in childhood. But our\nfaker apparently has been so clumsy as to neglect to read\nthe simple book of the churchyard tomb, and so he is\nunprepared to give the name of Edward Holmes* second\nson. He has, however, got hold of something more difficult\n\u2014the name Bernard Willoughby of the third son which is\nnot to be found in the churchyard.\nThe faker, however, is very familiar with the old Essex\ndirectories prior to 1887\u2014so familiar, in fact, that he\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 355\nwas able to give extempore in reply to an unforeseen\nquestion, the correct names Harrisson, Jessops and Till-\ncock (Till the Cock Crow ?) of three former residents in\nGreat Square, Braintree, and, in addition, the occupation of\nHarrisson. He is also well aware of the existence of the\nlawyer Cunnington and of the fact that the latter was in\nclose touch with Mr. Veley's business. The directory\nwhich has taught our faker so much should also have\ntaught him that the Christian name of Mr. Cunnington\nwas Augustus. Apparently, however, in spite of his ex-\ncellent memory for the obscure Jessop, Harrisson and\nTillcock, he has failed to note that the name of Cunning-\nton is the same as that of the elder Veley. Or, having\nnoted it, he is so obtuse that he cannot by putting two\nand two together connect up the \" Uncle Gus \" of the\ntest question with the only Augustus that was at all\neligible for the sobriquet.\nIn one of the scripts our faker gives the surname Miss\nDay in a wrong connection. This Miss Day was the\nname of Edward Holmes' second wife, who came from\nPeckham and is therefore not mentioned in the Braintree\nlist of residents. How came the faker to get hold of this\nname if not through reading some old notice of Miss\nDay's wedding to Edward Holmes ? And if he had come\nacross such a notice would he not have pounced upon it\nand pigeon-holed it in his memory for future use ? Yet\nhow comes it that when he is asked the name of Edward\nHolmes' second wife he is unable to give it ? A week\nlater, however, he volunteers correctly the Christian name\nAgnes of Edward Holmes' second wife, but still does not\nproduce the surname. What are we to make of this ?\nBut the most astonishing puzzle yet remains. Why\nshould a perpetrator of literary hoaxes, who has presumably\nfaked the Oscar Wilde script so well as to deceive both\nRobert Lynd and James Douglas, condescend to angle for\na lesser literary fish like Margaret Veley ? Would he not\nhave chosen for his second attempt some writer still\nremembered by our generation, and one whose style would\nrepay imitation and whose resurrection would cause a\nlittle flutter in the literary world ?\n\f356 Mr. V. [part\nOur faker is not only clumsy and strangely negligent\nbut also curiously oblivious of his own self-interests.\n\/\/. The Hypothesis of Cryptomnesia.\nI do not think cryptomnesia can be accepted as a\nmajor explanation of the Margaret Veley scripts any more\nthan it would serve to account for the Oscar Wilde scripts\ntaken in their entirety.\nIt is true that there are fragments of the Oscar Wilde\nscript which almost certainly had their origin in passages\nthat I had previously read in books or composed myself.\n[See Psychic Science, Jaxi. 1924, p. 314, and 8.P.R. Journal,\nJuly, 1926.] The resemblances in these cases are too\nobvious to be ignored, and cryptomnesia seems a perfectly\nlegitimate explanation when applied to these individual\ninstances. But for my mind to have gathered together the\nvery numerous scraps of information\u2014many of them of an\nout-of-the-way kind\u2014which are scattered throughout the\nscripts it would be necessary to assume that I had seen at\nleast five different lives of Wilde, and opened in a casual\nway a number of out-of-print books such as My Diaries,\nby Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, at just those pages where Oscar\nWilde is mentioned.\nFurther, I must have obtained also in a casual way a\nfar more intimate acquaintance with Wilde's prose works\nthan is represented by a reading of De Profundis, The\nPicture of Dorian Grey, and the Selected Poems. The\ncriticisms of living authors, for instance, would seem to be\nmodelled on those contained in The Decay of Lying,\nthough in no sense could they be described as plagiarisms.\nAnd it is difficult to believe that certain of the automatic\nessays could have been written by anyone who had not\nsteeped himself in the languid music of Irdentio7is.\nSimilar arguments against cryptomnesia apply with even\nmore force to the Margaret Veley scripts.\nWhile, for instance, it is possible that all the facts\nconcerning Edward Holmes and his family had their origin\nin my boyhood's reading of the Essex Weekly News from\n1898 onwards it is jiractically certain that my knowledge\nof the cat Zoroaster and of the \" Moly \" incident could\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 357\nhave come from no other source than the out-of-prmt work\nA Marriage of Shadoivs.\nBut even if we supposed that I might on some forgotten\noccasion have come across this book on some second-hand\nbook-stall and casually turned over its pages there are\nstill large numbers of facts quite unaccounted for. There\nis, for instance, the knowledge shown of the friendship\nbetween the Veleys and the Overtons, or the fact that the\nVeleys and Tabors were acquainted. It seems certain\nthat, even if these items could have been ferretted out of\nold newspapers, we should have to go back to the years\nbefore I was born. Again, there is the knowledge of the\nChristian name Julia of Margaret Veley's elder sister who is\nreferred to in A Marriage of Shadows merely as Mrs. Webb.\nIt is rather doubtful if that Christian name, together with\nthe lady's relationship to Margaret Veley, could have been\nobtained from an Essex newspaper of so late a date as\n1898.\nTo have got the name Cox and his occupation of\ndruggist we should have to refer to old directories or\nnewspapers round about the year 1854.\nThe names of former vicars of Braintree could have been\nlearned easily by walking inside Braintree church, but I am\ncertain I was never inside that church till I visited it in\nSeptember, 1928, in company with Mr. Salter. It is very\nimprobable though not impossible, that these names should\nhave been mentioned in the Essex Weekly News as late as\n1898.\nIt is also interesting to note that \" Agnes,\" the Christian\nname of Edward Holmes' second wife, is not given in the\nobituary notice of him which appeared in 1909, while the\nmarriage itself took place in the 'seventies.\nSupernormal Hypotheses.\nThe Automatisms Links with the Communicator.\nIf I did not know the truth about these scripts, and\nwere compelled to choose between conscious fraud and\ncryptomnesia, I should have to stake on fraud.\nFortunately we are not confined to such a choice. The\n\f358 Mr. V. [part\ncase has at least one curious precedent in the \" Hacking \"\ncommunications of a few years ago. Here the casual\nweek-end visit of a Wesleyan clergyman to the town of\nBury, and his subsequent attendance at a spiritualist\nseance, seems to have been the occasion for an immense\noutpouring of information from a trance medium concerning\nthe shopkeepers, tradesmen and other vanished residents\nof the district in which the late Mr. Hacking had lived\nhalf a century ago.\nIn this case the link between the psychic circle and the\n\"intelligence\" behind the communications seems to have\nbeen of the slightest ; apparently the mere fact that one\nof the circle had recently visited the locality was sufficient\nto start the train of supernormal communication.\nIn the Veley case the links are equally tenuous, but\nstiU they are there. I had once in my life passed an\nhour in the town in which Margaret Veley had lived. Mr.\nLuke lonides, an old friend of Miss Veley, had visited his\nson in the district in which I lived. Though I have never\nspoken to Mr. Luke lonides I have seen him at least once\nas he was being driven past me in a pony-cart, while his\nson Mr. Cyril lonides hved only a mile and a half from\nmy home. With Mr. Cyril lonides I have had many long\nconversations, but at that time I was unaware that the\nChristian name of his father was Luke. So far as I am\naware Mr. Cyril lonides knew nothing of Margaret Veley ;\nat any rate she was never made the subject of conver-\nsation.\nAnother link may have been made by my reading of the\npoem \" Almond Blossom.\"\n\/. The Hypothesis of Telepathy.\nThe first of the supernormal explanations which naturally\nsuggests itself is telepathy from the living. There are, I\nthink, several good reasons for rejecting this hypothesis as\na major explanation.\nIn the first place I have never been able to discover\nthat my automatic writing ever reflects the ideas or\nthoughts of the persons in whose company I write. At\nthe time when I was producing the \" Oscar Wilde \" scripts\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 359\nMrs. Travers-Smith was herself getting messages through the\nOuija board purporting to come from the same author.\nThese messages were spelled out in my absence, and when\nI visited her flat to attempt my own writing Mrs. Travers-\nSmith would carefully refrain from showing me these\nOuija messages until my own script was finished. Here,\ntherefore, was a unique opportunity for telepathy to assert\nitself. Nevertheless, I was quite unable to find that my\nscripts were in any way influenced by those Mrs. Travers-\nSmith had written in my absence. If, therefore, telepathy\nfailed to operate at a time when the conditions seemed\nparticularly favourable, it is difficult to imagine that while\nthe Veley scripts were being produced my mind succeeded\nin establishing rapport with the minds of people who were\nquite unknown to me and who had in all probability\nnever heard of me.\nAgain, I think it is extremely improbable that any one\nof Margaret Veley's living friends had in his or her memory\nevery one of the complex array of facts given at the\nsittings. Granting this we should have to assume that the\ncase is not a simple case of accidental rapport established\nbetween my mind and the mind of some individual\nrelative or friend. Instead it would be necessary to sup-\npose that my subconscious mind had accomplished extra-\nordinary feats of selection. It has had, so to speak, to\nknock at the doors of perhaps three or four different\nminds, and, gaining an entry, manage to obtain just those\nbits of information that are connected with Margaret Veley,\nextracting from one mind what it could not find in\nanother. A similar supposition would have to be made if\none tried to explain by telepathy from the living certain\nmental phenomena of Mrs. Piper, Mrs. Thompson or Mrs.\nLeonard.\nBut perhaps the main reason for rejecting the hypothesis\nthat Margaret Veley's living friends were the real source\nof the facts given in the script is to be sought for in the\nnature of the facts themselves.\nOn the assumption of spontaneous telepathy from the\nmind of an intimate friend one would, I think, expect the\nsubject matter of communication to consist largely of\n\f360 Mr. V. [part\nthe recollection of trivial incidents and personal souvenirs\nhaving an emotional interest for the mind of the living\nfriend.\nThe bulk of the information tendered, however, is not\nof this private personal character, but consists of facts\nthat must have been known to hundreds of residents of\nBraintree who were quite outside Miss Veley's circle. I\nshould hardly expect, for instance, that one of Miss\nVeley's intimates would provide me with such bits of\ninformation as the existence of the druggist Cox (which\ngoes back to the 'fifties) or the fact that Augustus Veley\nhad a brother F. Veley. The story of the pony walking\nup to its girth in a pond on a dark night is more the\nsort of thing one would expect if telepathy were at work.\nUnfortunately, although the narration of this alleged\nincident is accompanied by names that are correct and\nplausible, the story itself remains unverified. Possibly, of\ncourse, all the people are now dead who could have\nconfirmed it. As it is we have no evidence that the\nstory is anything more than a cunning subconscious\nfabrication, with one or two names added to lend it an\nair of plausibility.\nIn fact the messages are singularly devoid of just those\npieces of private information that one often obtains at a\ngood sitting with Mrs. Leonard, and which would serve to\nsupport the hypothesis of telepathy from either the dead\nMargaret Veley or from at least one of her still-living\nintimate friends.\nThe conjecture that the information was obtained\ntelepathically from the mind of some Braintree resident\nwho was not an intimate of Miss Veley's circle squares\nbetter with the actual facts, but I do not think it is\nentirely satisfactory. We should, of course, have to\nassume that such an old resident knew at least the\nnames of Miss Veley's novels, and that he had read A\nMarriage of Shadows, as otherwise we should be unable to\naccount for the \" Moly \" incident.\nWe might reasonably expect that living for years in\nBraintree he would know all or much more than the\nscripts give about Edward Holmes and his affairs. He\n\fno] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 361\nmight easily be aware that the Overtoils were friends of\nthe Veleys.\nBut should we be likely to get from a Braintree resident\nthe out-of-the-way fact that Mr. Alfred Warner, the\nhusband of Constance, Uved at Montagu Street,^ London ?\n\/\/. The Hypothesis of Clairvoyance.\nTo suggest that the supernormal knowledge contained in\nthese scripts has its source in \" a perception of Reality,\"\nor \"a sixth sense,\" is merely to renounce all attempts at\nintelligent discussion.\nI do not think that any advantage is gained by abandon-\ning the old-established terms telepathy, telaesthesia, clair-\nvoyance, in favour of some all-embracing non-committal\nword like \" cryptaesthesia.\" It is true that when we\ndescribe a case as a case of telepathy or of telaesthesia\nwe do not thereby gain any intimate understanding of\nit, but at least we classify it by assimilating it to a\nfamiliar class of phenomena which resemble it in certain\nimportant characteristics. It may be true also that our\npresent system of classification of mental phenomena is\noften crude and misleading, but that is no reason for\nabandoning the system before we have evolved a better\none.\nIn the case of the Margaret Veley scripts we must ask\nourselves : \"To what known class of supernormal pheno-\nmena are these scripts most readily assimilated ?\n\"\nWe have seen that the facts are on the whole not the\nsort of facts that come easily under the heading of\nspontaneous telepathy, whether we understand this term to\nmean an involuntary transmission of thought from a\ndistant agent to the automatist, or an active reading by\nthe automatist's subconscious mind of the mind of the\ndistant agent.\nNow it seems certain that the great bulk of the verified\ninformation exists somewhere as printed matter in books,\ndirectories, newspapers, or even birth certificates or death\n^ Not quite accurately given in the script as Montgomery Street, but\ntaken in conjunction with the other facts near enough to put coincidence\nout of the question.\n2a\n\f362 Mr. V. [part\ncertificates, and there is the possibility that with sufficient\npatience all the facts could be traced to printed sources,\nalthough Mr. Salter has not so far succeeded in doing this.\nEven items such as \" the hothouses of Mr. Holmes \" may\nquite possibly be mentioned in some old column of Brain-\ntree news, say, in connection with a gift to a local hospital,\netc.\nIn fact, with the exception of the two unverified in-\ncidents of \" the broken bottle in Cox's shop \" and of\n\" the pony walking into the pond,\" and of perhaps the\nknowledge shown of Mr. Luke lonides' habit of reading\nthe Spectator, there is hardly anything in the scripts that\nwe might not reasonably expect to find in print if we\ncould search long enough.\nI would suggest that the Spectator incident might be no\nmore than an astute inference drawn by my own sub-\nconscious mind from a memory I had of Mr. Cyril lonides\nwriting occasional articles on his barge for the same paper.\nMoreover, there is curious accuracy in the answer given\nto the question about the herb \" Moly \" that suggests\nstrongly that the real source was neither the memory of\nMargaret Veley nor of a living relative, but the account\ngiven in Leslie Stephen's biography.\nNow the supernormal reading of printed matter is a\nphenomenon that seems now to be fairly well established\nthrough the book-tests of Mrs. Leonard and Mrs. Cooper,\nand by such isolated experiments as those of Mr. Dunne\nand others.\nWhether, with Mr. Drayton-Thomas, we look upon the\nphenomena as being due to the agency of a discarnate\nspirit, or whether, with Mr. Dunne, we see in them the\nmind's prevision of its own future experience, is immaterial\nto our present purpose.\nThe fact remains that we have a good deal of evidence\ntending to show that there is sometimes an apparent\nreading of printed matter by supernormal means. In\nsupposing such a supernormal faculty to be at work in the\nM. V. scripts we should of course have to postulate that\nit possessed an extraordinary selective power over its\nmaterial. But in Mr. Drayton-Thomas' experiments with\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 363\nbooks the faculty seems also to be endowed with consider-\nable powers of selection. Just those phrases are chosen\nfrom the books which are in some way appropriate to\nMr. Drayton-Thomas' late father. Mr. Drayton-Thomas is\nof opinion that the possessor of this supernormal power of\nreading closed books is the actual surviving personality of\nhis deceased father. I would not venture so far as to\nsuggest that in my case the intelligence which apparently\nreads old newspapers and directories is the spirit of\nMargaret Veley. I have, however, some reason for believing\nthat the agent at work is not solely my own subconscious\nmind.\nAfter reading Mr. Dunne's book, A71 Experiment with\nTime, I have repeatedly tried to obtain impressions through\nautomatic writing of the contents of books I had not\npreviously read. Though as far as possible I followed\nMr. Dunne's methods I have never obtained anything I\ncould call even a moderate success. My hand wrote\nphrases, but they were either inappropriate or well within\nthe scope of chance-coincidence. Nor can my failure be\nattributed to lack of emotional interest. I was at least as\nkeenly interested in getting successful results in this\ndirection as ever I have been in obtaining sensational\n\" communications \" from the dead. And it is this repeated\nfailure that makes me believe that, if the M. V. scripts\nhave their origin in a supernormal reading of distant\nprinted sources, there is probably some factor at work\nwhich is external to my own mind.\n\/\/\/. The Spirit Hypothesis.\nIn discussing this, our final hypothesis, I am well aware\nthat I am venturing into regions that in our present\nignorance would seem to lie beyond the limits of legitimate\nscientific speculation. The history of modern science is a\nrecord of the elimination of spirits as agencies in the\nworking of the world and the substitution of rational\nlaws and mechanisms. When Kepler discovered that the\nplanets describe elliptic orbits with the sun as focus he\nsupposed that each planet was kept in its path by a\n\" guiding angel.\" To-day we look no longer for angels but\n\f364 Mr. V. [part\nseek to interpret gravitation by the very geometry of the\nspace-time in which we live.\nOur science of psychical research is still in the empirical\nstage. It is still to-day a collection of \" cases \" and\nisolated observations, with not a single well-estabhshed law\nto its credit so far as supernormal phenomena are concerned.\nIt is true, of course, that the scientific study of mind in\ngeneral has not made any progress comparable with that\nachieved by experimental physics or chemistry. Neverthe-\nless, if we are to make any scientific progress at all in\neither normal or abnormal psychology, our efforts must be\ndirected towards the discovery of rational and uniform\nlaws in the mental field, always assuming of course that\nsuch laws exist.\nOur first efforts in psychic research therefore should be\ndirected towards an exploration of the mechanisms of the\nsubconscious parts of the mind and the laws which under-\nlie its supernormal activities. Our primary business is\nwith the living minds that we partially know and not with\nthe hypothetical spirits of the dead. Immediately we begin\nto \" explain,\" say, a case of telepathy, by postulating that\nthe message was \" carried \" by the spirit of a dead man\nfrom the agent to the percipient, we are advancing the\nkind of hypothesis that will lead us nowhere. Such \" ex-\nplanations \" in reality explain nothing, and no true\nscientific man will be deceived by them.\nWe have not yet accumulated sufficient experience to be\nable to say with even probable certainty v\/hat are the\nlimits of the supernormal knowledge to be expected from a\nmedium concerning a person who has been dead for one,\nfive, ten, twenty or forty years. Decades of work may\nhave to be done before we are even in sight of such\ncertainty.\nTo-day we attempt to estimate what a spirit should be\nexpected to remember by analogy with what we know\nabout the memories of some living people. But such\nanalogies may not be legitimate, and the psychology of the\nsurviving mind may for ought we know be quite different\nfrom that of the living mind. It is only our lack of\norganised knowledge that makes us resort to such analogies.\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 365\nThe failure of a soi-disant Myer\u00ab to xeveal the contents\nof a sealed envelope\u2014a test wb^cli the living Myers set\ngreat store upon\u2014certainly does not advance his claim to\nbe considered the snvvi^ing mind of the living Myers, but\non the other hand it does not entirely invalidate it. It is\nconceivable ^ personality might survive which showed\na ^pp^i many of the characteristics of the living Myers,\nbut nevertheless with certain lacunae in its memory.\nIn our present ignorance we are quite justified in putting\nthe onus on the \" spirits \" to prove their case if they can,\nbut we are not justified in making dogmatic assertions as\nto what a spirit should be expected to remember.\nBecause I find I have forgotten the names of scores of\nmen whom I knew quite well in the army ten years ago,\nand whose faces and personal characteristics I can still\nrecall, I argue illogically that ought not to be surprised\nto find that after forty years Margaret Veley cannot\nremember the name of the gardener at Great Square or tne\nname of the pony.\nStill pursuing the analogy I argue again illogically that,\nthough Margaret Veley could not be expected to name the\ngardener or the originals of the two pastel portraits, yet\nshe ought to have been able to describe them and tell\ninteresting anecdotes about them, since in my own case,\nalthough I have forgotten the name of the man who slept\nin the dug-out with me at Guillemont, I could yet tell\nquite a number of true things about him.\nBut in this case the vagaries of the apparent \" spirit\nmemory \" are even more disconcerting than the lapses.\n\" M. V.\" can give us the names of people like Harrisson,\nJessops and Tillcocks, who meant probably little to her in\nlife, and yet fails to recognise the name Fish as being that\nof her old nurse. And how is it that the mention of\n\"Uncle Gus \" awakens no responsive chord in her memory?\nHere, as in the case of \" Fish,\" the difficulty cannot be\nthe comprehensible difficulty in recalling a proper name.\nThere is here apparently a real lacuna in the surviving\nmemory.\nOf course it may be possible that one day, if the spirit\nhypothesis becomes scientifically established, perfectly\n\f366 Mr. V. [part\nlegitimate explanatiOi.n r^^ay be forthcoming with regard to\nsuch ai^parent lapses of memory. But until that day\ncomes it is simply a waste of time to try to argue about\nthem, and a still greater waste ot time to attempt to\ninvent arbitrary excuses for them.\nAgain, I notice that throughout the scripts v\\^^^q jg often\nconsiderable circumlocution in the finding of proper x.\u00bbv^gg\nThus, in trying to recall her mother's name Sophia, the\n\" spirit \" is apparently only aware that the name she is\ntrying to give has some association with an article of\nfurniture, and Miss Hunt finds the right word for her by\nsuggesting \"Sofa.\" In trying to recall the name Stephen she\ncan only remember at first that she is after a Biblical name\nand then that it was the name of a man who was stoned.\nIn all this I may fancy that I detect an analogy with\nwhat is observed to happen in the case of certain aphasics.\nBut if I am wise I shall bear in mind that the analogy\nmay be merely a superficial one, and I shall refrain from\nfollowing the pernicious example of those psychic researchers\nwho rear their imposing castles of philosophy on founda-\ntions that would not bear the weight of a wooden hut.\nFor aught I know all this circumlocution in the giving\nof names may be nothing more than a mere piece of\nunconscious play-acting, and I absolutely refuse to see in\nit any support for the \" instrumental \" theory of mind, or\nindeed of any other theory.\nIn conclusion, I do not wish to ridicule the spiritistic\ninterpretation of these communications. It may conceiv-\nably be true that the surviving spirit of Margaret Veley in\nsome mysterious way assisted in their production. I would\nmerely emphasise that, regarded as a scientific working\nhypothesis, spiritism does not seem to me to be a very\nhopeful avenue of investigation. The spirit hypothesis has\na delusive appearance of simplicity, but so also had\nKepler's hypothesis of guiding angels. And how remote\nthis was from the complex reality of Einstein's description\nof gravitation ! In fact, if these supernormal mental\nphenomena depend on the whims and caprices of departed\nspirits, then I for one despair of ever being able to\ndiscover any law and order in them.\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. '\n367\nOne final word must be added. Cases of automatism\nlike those of \"Oscar Wilde\" or of \"Margaret Veley\n\"\ncan in no sense be considered as controlled experiments,\nand it would be absurd to criticise them as such. If one\ntakes a sitter anonymously to an automatist with proper\nprecautions controlled experiments can be made, but when\nan automatist suddenly produces a communication purport-\ning to come from a dead author no one can produce\nirrefutable evidence of the exact extent of the automatist's\nprevious knowledge. The case, therefore, fails at the outset\nto satisfy the canons of scientific investigation. Neverthe-\nless, such cases provide interesting material for reflection\nand speculation.\nThe Poetry of Mb. \" X.\"\nAlthough the Proceedings of this Society are only con-\ncerned indirectly with hterature as such I have thought it\nworth while for purposes of comparison to give specimens\nof the work of another communicator who writes almost\nexclusively in verse. Mr. \" X \" put in his first appearance\non 1st February, 1928, at one of the later M. V. sittings,\nwhen he expressed a desire to write a poem through my\nhand. Permission being granted he began immediately,\nand in a little over forty-five minutes he had' produced\nwithout a pause the poem \" Unfamihar Sounds,\" Miss\nHunt touching my hand in the usual way. On our ques-\ntioning him he declared that his identity was of no im-\nportance to us and that he wished to be referred to as\nMr. \" X,\" the unknown, and under this signature all his\nsubsequent verses have been written.\nThe poem \" Unfamihar Sounds \" printed below stands as\nit left the pencil of Mr. \"X,\" except for one or two quite\ntrivial corrections which he made at the next sitting when\nhe asked Miss Hunt to read the poem aloud. This sitting\nwas the last I had with Miss Hunt, who was prevented\nby pressure of business from assisting me further with my\nautomatic writing.\nI did not resume automatic writing till May 1928, when\nI attempted writing one day in the presence of Mrs.\nMackenzie, wife of Prof. J. Mackenzie, late Fellow of Trinity\n\f368 Mr. V. [part\nCollege, Cambridge, at their house in Adelaide Road, Chalk\nFarm. M. V. did not manifest at this sitting, but Mr.\n\" X \" wrote the first three verses of what proved subse-\nquently to be a very long poem called \" Moel Siabod,\"\ndescriptive of the Welsh mountain of that name which I\nknow intimately through many hohdays spent in the\nSnowdon district.\nAfter this first sitting with Mrs. Mackenzie University\nexamination work made it imj)ossible to continue with\nautomatic writing until the following October. On Oct.\n10th I had a second sitting with Mrs. Mackenzie, and at\nthis sitting \"X\" manifested and resumed immediately the\nwriting of \" Moel Siabod \" at the point where he had\nabandoned it in May. The sittings with Mrs. Mackenzie\nwere now continued weekly during the whole of the\nautumn term, and \"X\" wrote \"Moel Siabod\" at the\nrate of perhaps half a dozen or sometimes more stanzas\na week. There was much re -writing and many emenda-\ntions but at last towards the end of December the long\npoem was finished. In all there are 72 stanzas written in\nthe metre of hi Memoriam.\nDuring all this time \" X \" had persistently refused to\ndisclose his identity, but on one occasion he told us that\nduring his lifetime he had visited the Snowdon district and\nthat after his death he had \" seen the Snowdon mountains\nthrough the eyes of this automatist \"\n\u2014presumably on the\noccasion of one of my many visits to North Wales.\nOn 19th December, 1928, \" X \" wrote the first fifteen\nlines of a new \"Welsh\" poem \" Tryfan,\" which was com-\npleted at the next sitting of 2nd January, 1929.\nOf the 150 fines this poem contains I have only space\nto print the first forty, but the level of the poem is\nmaintained throughout both as regards imagination and\nfinish.\nConcerning \" X \" I think that we may justly claim that\nhe is both a more ambitious and a more promising poet\nthan the \" M. V.\" of the script. His imaginative range\nis wider and his subject matter more modern, and at\npresent he continues to develop in poetic power while\n\"M. V.\" has apparently declined and ceased to manifest.\n\f110] The Literary Style of the Scripts. 369\nBut the objections to his claim to be considered a\n\" spirit \" are even greater with Mr. \" X \" than in the\ncase of \" M. V.\" On one occasion Mrs. Mackenzie asked\n\" X \" if he were \" Mr. V.'s \" subconscious mind and he\nrephed \" Certainly not !\n\" but in spite of this rather in-\ndignant denial he produces no evidence that he is anything\nelse.\nHe writes poems about two Welsh mountains, \" Moel\nSiabod \" and \" Tryfan,\" both of which I know in all their\naspects. I have chmbed \" Moel Siabod \" in all twenty-one\ntimes\u2014from Dolwyddelen as well as from Capel Curig\u2014and\nI have made the descent to Pen-y-Gwryd as well as to\nLake Gwynant. I have stood between the two stone men\non the rocky summit of \"Tryfan\" and I have seen them\nfrom the Bangor Road black against a sunset sky. There\nis no Welsh name or old allusion in these two long poems\nthat is not known to me. All this subject matter there-\nfore has been the food of my own senses, and there is no\nneed to think of \" X \" as anything else than my own\nsubconscious activity assimilating and transforming this\nraw material.\nIndeed it is only a commonplace to say that all poetic\ncreation exemphfies the same process. An impression is\nreceived by way of the senses ;\nit is idly rejected as of\nno importance and works its way down into some for-\ngotten subsoil of the mind where it hes buried for days\nor months or years. One day there is thrown up a jewel,\na shining gem, pohshed by the ceaseless fretting of the\nmind's dark waters.\nWith different automatic writers this work of sub-\nconscious transformation is carried on to varied stages.\nIn the case of \" Patience Worth \" the crude images, more\nor less striking and fine, are poured out in profusion but\nthe poetic form which would give them a proper setting\nis absent, and for lack of this poetic setting the images\nlose much of their effect as poetry. But \" X \" achieves\nnot only the poetic images and ideas but a poetic form\nas well. With this much introduction we may leave his\nverses to speak for themselves.\n\f370 Mr. V.

ARTHUR HILL.\nIn March 1928 the vicar of a north-country parish drew\nthe attention of the S.P.R. to a case of automatic writing\nwhich seemed to him interesting enough to be investigated\nby some member of the Society. Mr. Salter communicated\nwith me, and I had some correspondence with the vicar,\nand two interviews with him and the automatist. After\nthe first interview I brought home with me a large mass\nof the script, or rather of a foolscap fair copy of the\noriginal pencil writing which is difficult to read ; and at\nthe second interview I discussed the script and asked\nquestions about the automatist's history and the hke. In\nwhat follows, I give a condensed account of the case.\nThe correspondence, with fuller extracts, may be consulted\nin the files of the Society. It should be said at once\nthat there seems no need to supjiose any supernormal\nagency, and the case is therefore on the borderhne between\npsychology and psychical research ; but such cases may\nthrow fight on the workings of the subfiminal and on its\nrelation to the suprafiminal, and may accordingly help\nus in the study of more purely psychical-research problems.\nI am requested to withhold the name and location of the\nautomatist, lest offence or pain should be caused to\nrelatives who do not altogether approve of these things.\nMrs. Gary (pseudonym) is a woman of the working class,\naged about fifty. She is of purely British stock\u2014as is her\nhusband\u2014and her people have been mostly farmers,\nthough she herself was born in London. She looks healthy\nand strong, with the good colour of a countrywoman. She\nwas the seventh of a large family, and the superstitious\nwould say that she has the gifts of a seventh child. Her\nhome fife has been happy, and she has had eight children.\n375\n\f376 J. Arthur Hill. [part\nHer husband knows of her automatic writing, and is not\nmuch interested, though not hostile. She hved in Russia\nfrom the age of thirteen to twenty-three, her father being\nemployed out there. She had not much education, but is\nintelhgent\u2014above the average, I should say\u2014and has been\na considerable reader. She read Shakespeare pretty\nthoroughly when she was a girl, also Scott, Dickens,\nThackeray, Harrison Ainsworth, Marie Corelli, and Theo-\nsophical writers ; a rather mixed lot, as with most of us.\nAlmost the only poetry she has read seems to be the\nRubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. A diary which she Idndly\nlent me shows that from youth she had a tendency to\nunusual experiences ; \"a subconscious knowledge has\nhaunted me from earhest childhood, a knowledge that I\nhave lived before and know much of which I could give\nno expression.\" She also mentions a constant fear that\nshe was never alone and that someone was just going to\ntouch her. In the presence of fine scenery she has had\nsomething approaching a mystical experience of the\nJefferies-Whitman kind :\n\" the glories of a sunrise or sunset,\nand I feel my soul expand and I am on the point of\nflying toward that which I know lies just beyond, but this\nbody, this cage, this prison, holds me back, and I must\nwait and do my duty to those who have been given into\nmy care.\" The death of a son, aged two, in 1914, coupled\nwith the reading of Omar\u2014according to the diary\u2014seem\nto have focussed her thoughts on serious things ; she\nattended a spiritualist meeting at which her son was\ndescribed and was said to be making a gesture which she\nrecognised as characteristic, and her grandmother was also\nrecognisably described. Bi;t her interest turned to Theo-\nsophy rather than to Spiritualism, perhaps because of her\nearly leanings to the idea of reincarnation.\nThe automatic writing began in September 1923, at first\nwith a planchette but soon becoming easy with a free\npencil. There are many communicators, but the chief of\nthem is one Strombrunsen, Overlord of Galicia at a date\nnot specified. He represents himself as a soul-mate of the\nautomatist in past incarnations. He has written the story\nof his life, and there are other histories or biographies\n\f110] Some Eeincarnationist Automatic Script. 377\nconcerning other characters. Three of the narratives are\nof the length of an average novel. The Strombrunsen\nstory has been copied in ink from the original scripts\nwliich are difficult to decipher, and may have been\ntouched up in the process ; but the vicar says\u2014and he\nhas gone through much of the original writing\u2014that when\nMrs. Gary makes any \" improvement \" in a word or\nphrase, she makes it worse, weakening its force. She\nwrites an introductory note as below :\nStrombrunsen, an ego whose work on this earth is\nfinished, but still is he held to it by strong bonds of love\nfor his mate whom he is awaiting on the other side.\nHer soul is still on this earth inhabiting the body of a\nwoman of the working class. He knows her spu-it is\nflagging behind a dense veil of ignorance which has been\nimposed upon her by a higher power for this her last life\non this world, and he in his love and solicitude has gained\npermission to unfold to her through the medium of auto-\nmatic writing a glimmering of the mighty truth of life\neternal by telling of the love, passion, and mistakes that\nhas (sic) ruled in lives they have lived together on this\nworld in ages long past.\nHe tells the stories merely to help over a difficult period\nthat comes in every woman's life when as often happens\nall aspects seem blank and hopeless.\nThe first readable sentence in the automatic script was :\n\" Hast thou forgotten Strombrunsen of Strombrunsen in\nthe forests of Gahcia ?\n\" The name was new to the\nautomatist. The writing continued :\n\" With me was hved\na life, a hfe of misunderstanding sin and sorrow. Thou\ndidst not love me, but ever from the beginning of time\nhast thou dwelt within my soul, my beloved \" . . . \"My\nlittle one, fear nothing, no harm shall come near thee, I\nwho love thee will ever gmde and guard thee. Give love\nand care to those thou hast in thy charge ;\nspeak no ill\nof anyone ; do all the good thou canst ;\nand in the\nfullness of time when thou hast learned all the lessons\nthat are in that world to learn, I shall be waiting for\nthee, for thou art mine, my beloved.\"\n2 B\n\f378 J. Arthur Hill. [part\nSometimes no writing came when she tried, sometimes\nonly a word or two, but sometimes twenty or thirty pages\nwould be written without a break, and at great speed.\nI will quote an early paragraph as an example of style,\nand will then summarise the remainder.\nI, Eleu Strombrunsen, was born in the castle of Strom-\nbrunsen in Galicia. My father, Strang Strombrunsen, a\nman mighty in stature and power, was killed whilst\nhunting when I was ten years of age, leaving me in the\ncare of a most indulgent mother whose heart was buried\nin the grave of him who had been her life. I, being all\nthat was left of him, in her eyes could do no wrong.\nWilful, headstrong passions were allowed full sway, with\nnever a restraining hand or voice to say that anything\nwas wrong. My will was absolute. There was but one\nthing that acted as a slight curb on my unruly tempera-\nment, and that was the love I bore my mother, that tall,\npale lady in whose eyes I dreaded to meet the reproof her\nlips never uttered.\nHe describes his youth\u2014hunting, sports, succession to\nthe overlordship when his mother died\u2014then his disputes\nwith rulers of adjacent territories, notably a John of\n\" Draconfel ''\nin \" Siluria,\" and an underlord of his own\nnamed Bulstanger, who lived in the north-west. (Draconfel\nis sometimes spelt Draconsfel in the script, and probably\nboth are drawn from recollections of the Drachenfels near\nBonn, which figures in the Nibelungen Lied.) Strombrunsen\ndescribes how a maiden rescues a dog which ran under his\nhorse's hoofs, and he falls in love with her. She turns\nout to be Bulstanger's daughter, Syhlene, who is betrothed\nto John of Draconfels. Strombrunsen marries the girl,\nworsts Draconfels in battle, and takes his bride home.\nShe is only a girl of sixteen, she was unwilling to marry,\nand she is afraid of Strombrunsen and his violent passions.\nSome of the passages in the script at this point are\nrather coarse. She escapes and goes home to her father.\nStrombrunsen follows, and he kills Bulstanger in fight,\nthough unintentionally, for he meant to treat him well in\norder to win Syhlene's love.\n\f110] Some Reincarnationist Automatic Script. 379\nAfter some years, and the birth of a son, Strombrunsen,\nunable to win his wife's love, leaves his castle and goes\nroving and fighting with a band of his men. He comes\nback after ten years, to find that his wife has become a\nnun. He goes after her, breaks into the convent, killing\nsome of the attendants, and fetches Syhlene back to the\ncastle. There is a reconcihation ; she had begun to love\nhim before his departure, but her pride would not let her\nsay so. And now it is too late ; she is ill and dying.\nThe Church has excommunicated him for breaking into the\nconvent, but he fetches a priest by force, to administer\nthe last rites to his dying wife. Then he kicks the fat\npriest out, watches with Syhlene until her spirit passes,\nand kills himself with a knife-thrust in the throat. A\npostscript to the story, by a retainer and friend named\nBoise, tells how Strombrunsen's body was found lying\nthere. This addition by Boise is curious, seeming to\nconform to mundane hterary necessities. If Strombrunsen\nwere telHng the story himself, as claimed, he could finish\nit himself, one would think, for he would presumably\nknow where and how his body would be found. Syhlene\nis of course the automatist in an early incarnation.\nOther names occurring in the Strombrunsen story are :\nWhite Melten\u2014the name of the castle\u2014Elsa, Henrich,\nKarluchen, Schwartzburgenshof, Borian's Tower, Michael\nthe Murderer, Henry of Schlangwerten, and Wensel. It\nwiU be noticed that there is much mixture of languages\nin the names, and that the speUing is sometimes only an\napproximation to the probable forms. The automatist\nlearnt \" Httle Russian and no German \" while hving in\nRussia, but she would inevitably hear scraps of many\nlanguages.\nAnother writing which describes a horrible crime in some\napparently Scandinavian country, contains the names Ulef\nson of Errk, Elkia daughter of Roma, Matuga daughter of\nOffa, Olsa son of Errk. Elkia is again the automatist in\nan early incarnation. The story is a \" thriller,\" with much\nrepetition concerning \" swart Errk's \" \" mighty shoulders\n\"\nand the \" rolling laughter in his chest.\" This story\nappears to have come in a dream, being written out\n\f380 J. Arthur Hill. [part\nafterwards. Probably therefore it shows Mrs. Gary's\nconscious mind more or less at work, for the phrasing\nwould be hers or would pass through her revision.\nThere is also an account of the last years of the island\nof Leonis, which was destroyed by a great tidal wave,\nfollowing the eruption of a volcano called \" Schehalhon.\"\nThe names in this story are Helga the Fair, Toarhn the\nMinister, Roanib the King, Foedra\u2014a man cast ashore\nafter shipwreck\u2014the Priests of Orr, and Albion Mochre\nwho is the narrator. Mrs. Gary told me that at the time\nof this script she did not know that there was a mountain\ncalled Schiehallion in Scotland or indeed anywhere. But\nof course she might have known and forgotten.\nThen there is a very long story about Tyane, a son of\nthe King of Oceane. The heroine is one Malieela, and the\nnames of three of the nobles are Mahgruda Sehan, Teor-\nchen Sehan, and Margior Sehan ; the word Sehan being\napparently a title, perhaps suggested by \" sahib.\" There\nis a Temple of Aachon, and one of the officials is the\n\" Keeper of the Jewels of the Seventh Temple.\" I quote\nall these names because they may turn out to have some\nhnguistic interest, as in the Helene Smith case described\nin Prof. Flournoy's book From India to the Planet Mars.\nOther narratives deal with incidents occurring in Egypt\nand Greece. There is the story of \" Rosa's son \"\u2014an\nillegitimate child of Strombrunsen's\u2014and his doings during\nthe ten years of his father's absence. Then a story of\n\" Speridon BHades of Ascalon.\" Then other stories, e.g. of\nthe life of Desaria, another incarnation of the automatist.\nThese narratives run pretty much on the same hues ;\nthey\ntell of wild times, hunting, fighting, and orgies of drink\nand passion. In each case, however, the hero is conscious\nthat his lower self ought to be mastered by his higher\nself, and that love is more than passion. Each story shows\nthe development of this consciousness in a man of rude\ntimes, and the narratives are strong and of a certain\nconvincingness, in spite of a tendency to purple passages\nwhich do not always ring quite true. There are scraps of\nvarioiis languages, including Arabic, but perhaps not more\nthan the subliminal of anyone might be able to furnish ;\n\f110] Some Reincarnationist Automatic Script. 381\ne.g. \"nomina non sequ. . .\n.\" \" Nuncio pas Vamoria,\" \" Salaam\naleikum,\" and many German phrases of ordinary character.\nThe Strombrunsen story seems to belong to the Middle\nAges ; the hero uses the exclamation \" Body of Christ,\"\nbut also swears occasionally by the gods of his forefathers,\nso perhaps the time is supposed to be early in our era.\nI am not aware that any of the Galician or Scandinavian\nwarriors mentioned in the script are historical characters,\nbut I have not made any research on the point. The\nnames were new to the automatist so far as her supra-\nliminal consciousness was concerned, so they are either\nsubliminal debris or subhminal inventions\u2014that is, if we\ndo not assume that some of the communicators are real\nentities in another order of being.\nA few historical characters do purport to communicate,\nand\u2014as usual in such cases\u2014they are not obscure ones.\nJuhus Caesar appears, and the automatist feels that she\nis being ordered or reprimanded when he is writing ; his\ninfluence is severe. A Charles writes, who purports to be\nCharles the Second ; the automatist feels a jocular in-\nfluence from him. It appears that she was his wife in\nher incarnation of that period. A drawing produced by\nthe automatist, with the usual arabesques and fancy\nwork, represents the Merry Monarch, spaniel and aU. We\nmust not forget that this appearance of great names has\noccurred before, along with real psychic powers, in the\ncase of Mrs. Piper, who also produced a Julius Caesar.\n(Mrs. Cary did not seem to have heard of this, or of Mrs.\nPiper. I asked her.) Real communications from another\nworld must come through the medium's mind in some way,\nand\u2014as someone has said\u2014the medium's dreams may \" get\nin the way,\" and absurdities may result. However, in this\ncase of Mrs. Cary's there does not seem to be anything\nevidential as in the Piper case. Mrs. Cary's son is cer-\ntainly mentioned as communicating, but it is hardly to be\nexpected that much evidence of identity could be obtained\nin such a case.\nMrs. Cary occasionally gets inspirational or automatically\nwritten verse, somewhat after the same kind as the prose,\nthough not purporting to be written by the same com-\n\f382 J. Arthur Hill. [part\nmunicators. One rather interesting example came as a\nsort of vision of the words, seen on the haft of a knife.\nOne of her children had to compose some original verse\nas a home task, and did not know how to begin. Her\nmother said :\n\" Oh, write about anything\u2014a knife, for\ninstance \" (happening to look at a table knife on the\ntable). She then saw a succession of words on the handle\nof the knife, and wrote them down :\nA knife ! What, a knife ?\nGramercy on my life.\nYou'd have me rhyme upon a knife ?\nA thing which cuts my loaf of bread,\nFrom fisli and fowl oft strikes the head ;\nGod's life, a knife ?\nEmblem of strife\u2014a knife.\nIt makes me think of days long past,\nWhen men in hate and fury clasped\nThe haft in hand, at its command\nTo slay, and did obey ;\nDid slay, and blood.

While praying, she\nhas had visions of Christ. But she does not go to church\nor take an interest in any religious institution. Her\nreligion is very individuaUstic. Still, there is nothing of\nthe extremist or crank about her ; she is anxious only to\nget at the truth. Her automatic writing is a puzzle to\nher, and in spite of the pleadings of the chief communi-\ncator she does not quite accept what is told her. After\nmy second talk with her, her doubts seem to have become\nstronger\u2014though I had expressed no definite opinion and\nhad been sympathetic\u2014for the communicator tried to\nreassure her, also rather deprecating publicity :\nI will repay thy disbelief by telling thee that which shall\nbe proven. Hurt am I, my little one, that thou canst\nentertain doubts of that which I have told thee. Is it\nnecessary that others should know that truth which I have\ntold to thee alone ? For thy peace of mind did I come\nto thee, knowing that thou wert wearying of the last few\nsteps along that journey so nearly finished. Believe, my\nbeloved, believe ! How oft have I bidden thee do that,\nand yet dost thou doubt ? I cannot do more just yet to\nprove to thee that which I have told was granted to me\nas a reward, a little acknowledgment for the work I have\ndone. To me was that boon granted when I asked for it,\nthe boon to communicate with thee and to aid thee\nalong that road thou art traversing with lagging footsteps.\nI begged that boon, my little one, my beloved, and thou\ndoubtest the truth which I have told thee ! Therefore I\nbid thee once more, fear nothing, and believe.\n^\nCf. some verses obtained by automatic writing or between sleeping\nand waking, by Mrs. Verrall ;\nProceedings, vol. 20, pp. 65-6, 362-5.\n\f384 Arthur Hill. [part\nThere are occasional episodes in which conflicting\ncommunicators are concerned. For example :\nAflaha Retief Refusis (or Refusis Aflaha, for the name\nis variously given) Lord of the Seven Stars, Master of all\nthe Mysteries of Egypt, Ruler of the destinies of men,\nflung from the height of his power to the depths of\nimpotency to wander in the dark with the full knowledge\nof his power and yet imable to use it. Ages have passed\nsince the sin was committed which sent him hurling from\nthe heights he had striven to attain, to wander ever in\ndarkness until the time when she whom he had sinned\nagainst (sentence unfinished).\nThen there came a drawing of a man in Arab headdress,\nand in large letters at the side was :\nRefusis hlesindbah Afleehla on the banks of the Nile go\nback to your life if (scrawl) Alleahlegleemshabolstallenskem-\nstaasenenwishing to know\nPut the book away and listen to me I will be there\nwhere you wish me to be always I love you and you must\nguard against allowing yourself to get in touch with un-\ndesirables I will guard you but you must help us Jn\n(scrawl, wavy line across paper)\nAlec is here Mama with you is very bad form you must\nnot allow to speak to you and pray to go away your\nfriend will guard you all they can but you too must help\nby not allowing to speak Eleuling Strombrunsen wishes\nyou to put this book away and give no opportunity to\nevil to write. All will be well, nothing shall harm you.\nA curious thing is that this Refusis is represented as an\nEgyptian incarnation of Strombrunsen, Charles being\nanother ;\nyet all communicate as independent entities, and\nStrombrunsen says that Refusis is wholly evil and that\nthe automatist must have nothing to do with him. How\nfar their memories are identical or overlapping or distinct,\nis uncertain. Strombrunsen seems to know all about the life\nof Refusis, and is indeed the chief communicator. One is re-\nminded of B 3 in Dr. Morton Prince's case of Miss Beauchamp.^\n1 Myers's -f\/wwan Personality, vol. i., pp. 341-52, and Proceedings S.P.R.,\nvol. 15, pp. 466-83.\n\f110] Some Reincarnationist Automatic Script. 385\nThe writing is automatic in what may be called an\naverage sense. The extreme form is that in which the\nautomatist knows notliing of what is being written, not\neven the word or letter that is being formed. Stainton\nMoses could read a book while his hand wrote. On the\nother hand, some automatists are aware of the sense of\nwhat is being written. In Mrs. Gary's case the automatist\nis aware of each word as it is being written, but each\nword fades from her memory as the next is begun. She\nhas no knowledge of the meaning of a sentence until she\nreads it over. She cannot get the writing at will, or when\nanyone else is present ; it requires sohtude and quiet.\nBefore the writing begins she has no knowledge of what\nwill come. I asked her whether she ever dreamt about\nthe characters who had appeared . in the script, and she\nsaid that this had happened only two or three times in\nthe five years. Apparently the writing stratum is not the\ndreaming str^-tum.\nAs to the reincarnationist teaching of the script, it may\nbe noted that Mrs. Gary joined the Theosophical Society\nin 1925, but this was two years after the script began and\nmany years after the beginning of her interest in reincar-\nnation, so the teaching is not the result of local influence.\nIndeed she is not at all an enthusiastic Theosophist,\nalthough a member.\nWhat has been said will have reminded the reader of\nthe case of Patience Worth, studied by Dr. Walter F.\nPrince.^ Mrs. Gary's communicators are more varied, and\nperhaps show less originality and pungency ; but in both\ncases there are long and well-constructed narratives, with\na richness of out-of-the-way detail which is quite beyond\nanything that the automatist could do by conscious effort.\nThis, however, is no proof of outside agency. Indeed,\nconscious effort seems to have very little to do with\nliterary creation. F. W. H. Myers says that genius is a\nsubhminal uprush ; and anyone who has written much,\nwhether fiction or anytiling else, is no doubt aware that\nliis thoughts \" come \" from some source other than his\n1 The Case of Patience Worth, by Dr. W. F. Prince. (Boston Society\nfor Psychic Research, 1927.)\n\f386 J. Arthur Hill. [part\nconscious or supraliminal mental levels. They are not\nproduced in the same way as the conclusion of a syllogism\nor the end of a calculation. Perhaps all creation is\nsubhminal. Stevenson used to dream his plots. If he\ncould have geared his subliminal to the fingers of his right\nhand, he might have written his stories automatically. On\nthe other hand we must not altogether exclude the\npossibihty of communication from some other mind,\nincarnate or discarnate, by automatic writing ; but we\nmust not accept that supposition without good evidence\nshown.\nIt may be provisionally held, by those who wish to\ntheorise, that the case under review is of the nature of\na compensatory phantasy ; an elaborate piece of fiction\ncomposed by the automatist's subliminal and presented as\nfact to the supraliminal, as a set-off to the dullness of\nordinary life. On this view it would have analogies with\nday-dreaming and with our identification of ourselves with\nthis or that character in a novel as we read it ;\nprobably\nmost fiction readers do this to a greater or less extent,\nthough for the most part without reaUsing it. It is a\nwholesome way of escape from the trivial round, the\ncommon task, of everyday life. On the other hand there\nis always danger in these self-exaltations. We are wisely\nwarned against thinking of ourselves more highly than we\nought to think. And there does seem to be a tendency,\nin automatic script, for great names to appear and flattering\nthings to be said ;\ngenerally the automatist is to be the\nchannel of a new and great revelation. The great claims\nand the flattering things may be true, but it is well to\ngo slowly and to maintain a critical temper. Nor indeed\nis it well to accept too easily the current subhminal\n\" explanations.\" In most of these cases there are features\nwhich are not thus explicable satisfactorily to the critical\nmind.\nPerhaps the wisest course, at present, is to record these\ncases without attempting a theory which may be pre-\nmature.\nWe know very little yet about the workings of the mind,\nparticularly in its subliminal levels, or about discarnate\n\f110] So7ne Reincarnationist Automatic Script. 387\nintelligences if such there be ; and premature theorising\nmight block the way to real advance. It is best to\naccumulate data in the hope that by study thereof we may\nbe led in the right direction and may eventually attain\nsome true insight into these puzzling phenomena and their\nimplications. Our thanks are due to those who supply us\nwith such data ;\nand, if they are inevitably disappointed\nwith our inability to explain the experiences, they may\nat least rest assured that their contribution is bringing\nnearer the time when such explanation will be possible.\n\fEEVIEWS\nI.\n\" A Case of Apparent Obsession : And its Treatment on the\nAssumption that the Obsessing Entities are to be taken\nat their Face Vahies.\" An article by Geoffrey C.

Before and\nsince his married life, his sexual habits have been free, but\nthe Wasserman test was negative in 1926. Of moderate\nambition and without desire for self-improvement, his self-\ndistrust has made him decline promotions which would have\nincreased responsibility. He is inclined to lose his temper and\nis emotionally unstable. A Roman Catholic himself, of undevout\nhabits, in 1906 he married an Episcopalian, with whom he\nclaims to have lived happily, although she sometimes scolded\nhim for drinking, but never to the point of producing quarrels.\nThere were five children, of whom three boys survive. The\nwife died in 1919.\nHis bereavement brought about a depressed condition, and\nhe drank heavily for more than a year. In July 1920 he\ndecided to quit drinking. The very next morning he woke to\nhear faint voices apparently near his right ear. At first these\ngave him advice about his children.

He acquired\nconsiderable interest in such and a degree of belief. Not once\nin four years did he go to a doctor or a clinic. In September\n1924 he heard of Dr. Bull and went to him. Up to January\n1925 he was treated by suggestion and medicine. During this\nperiod there was considerable general improvement ; his sleep,\nwhich at the beginning of the treatment averaged but two hours in\ntwenty-four, improved, and the voices became less annoying. At\nfirst he was sympathetic and co-operative with the physician.\nBut his co-operation later decreased, and when experiments with\nthe medium began he did not extend the same sympathy to her.\nHe declares that at no time did he, directly or indirectly, give\nany information to her, or to anyone who could have conveyed\nit to her.^ He lost his confidence in Spiritualism, mostly at\nleast, because of the slow progress of his amelioration, although\nhe admitted that the medium said about him many true things,\nwhich fact he ascribed to mind-reading.\nBeginning in September 1926, he went four times to the\nclinic of the New York Neurological Institute, and claims to\nhave received no benefit, though the records disjjute this.

Aside from sporadic and vague appearances they were\nabout forty-three in number thus classified by Dr. Burns :\n1. Obsessors, seven or eight in number; 2. Workers, their\nobject to help the patient, about twenty-four ; 3. Relatives of\nthe patient or his family, seven ; 4. Incidentals, who can\nhardly be said to have any particular purpose, about nine.\nThe purported obsessors in the case were: 1. A \"silly girl,\"\napparently epileptic ; 2. \" Gyp,\" a criminal whose crimes and\nexecution were described in the newspapers some years ago ;\n3. \"Ed. Mason\" of the underworld; 4. \" Al,\" a dope fiend;\n5. A male, apparently unnamed ; 6. \" Joe \" or \" John,\"\n'\nsupposed to be an Italian alcoholic ; 7. a \" simple woman ;\n\"\n8. a syphilitic woman.\nNone of these was known to the patient, except that he of\ncourse must have heard of Gyp. And none of them, it appears,\nwas identified by him as one of the producers of his obsessing\nvoices. So far as the examples of their talk through the\nmedium are given by Dr. Burns, it does not seem to me\nevident that they have essentially different styles of speech.\nOf course certain verbal tags are introduced to suit the pre-\nsumed character. Even the imaginative child could accomplish\nthat. Thus \" Gyp \" says \" damned \" and calls policemen\n\" bulls \" as the Saturday Evening Post has taught us that\n\"yeggs\" do. So \"bambino\" is ascribed to the supposed\nItalian, and \" achushla \" and \" worrah \" to the Mother, belong-\ning to another class. But \"Gyp\" and \"Silly Girl\" and\n\"John\" and \"Mother\" and \"Wife\" appear all to talk in\na like choppy, ejaculatory fashion. It may be that this is\npartly because only scraps could be taken down, but the fact\nremains that any evidence from disparate styles of speech is\nscanty.\nIt is intimated that some of the family entities, and declared\nthat the \" Mother,\" unintentionally hurt the patient in their\nefforts to remain near and ward off harmful spirits. The\ninvestigator thinks, and we shall probably agree with him, that\ngranting the theory of obsession this could have been so.\nNor is this the first time that such a claim has been made ;\nnotably, in Dr. Hyslop's experiments with Doris as a sitter,\nher \" Mother \" claimed to have discovered that her over-\nsolicitude had been of injury. But as most probably the\n\f392 Reviews. [part\nmedium in the J.D. case had read Dr. Hyslop's report, we are\nunable to give weight to this agreement.\nThe \" workers \" formed a numerous and incongruous group,\n\" one or two \" popes, \" at least \" nine professors, three presi-\ndents of the United States, two Indians, an Oriental physician\nan \" atzee \" (whatever that is), \" Imperator \" and others. If\nwe could only isolate one medium from previous knowledge\nof that winged sage Imperator, and get messages from him\nthrough her ! The \" William James \" in this case may really\nbe the spirit of the Harvard professor, although if he is mani-\nfesting with all the automatic writers and talkers who claim\nhim, he must possess the attribute of omnipresence in a degree\nonly less than divine. Although, as we shall see, the characters,\nor some of them, appear to have given a variety of evidence\nrelated to the patient, it is not shown that any of them\nfurnished any particular evidence to establish their own identity\nas persons who had lived on the earth, unless it was the wife,\nwho gave her name, a fairly accurate description of her death,\nand a significant fact or two which had happened in her\nlifetime.\nThe investigator, discussing the theory that all this drama\noriginates in the subconscious, agrees that perhaps this may\nbe the case, but thinks it \" difficult to conceive of her [the\nmedium] carrying through so many different entities and keep-\ning them as well separated as she has done.\" Although\nperhaps more impressed with the evidence in general for\ncommunicating \" entities \" than Dr. Burns, I confess that I\nam not so much impressed by this particular species of evidence\nas he. If the forty-three \" entities \" had been brought forward\nthe first week, the difficulty of remembering all and keeping\nthem distinct would be beyond question. But if one by one\ncame forward in the course of two or more years, I do not\nsee why they could not have been remembered and kept\nseparate as an actor is able to remember and resume at will\na multitude of roles. There are pianists who can play many\npieces, each with its individual and complicated pattern of\nfinger-movements, while carrying on a conversation. I know,\none who jingles scores of them at a Boston \" movie theatre,\"\nwith his head over his shoulder much of the time, as he\ncuriously scans the audience. Let there be formed in the\n\f110] Reviews. 393\nsubconscious a picture of each character in the gradually\nincreasing company, with a brief concept of character and\ncharacteristics attached, and each would suggest, every time\nit rose, appropriate tags of speech to correspond. Besides, the\nremark that at times entities \" seemed to overlap \" indicates\nthat they were not always kept separate.\nThe investigator thinks that should we say they [the\nentities] were all products of the medium's mind, conscious or\nsubconscious, we are giving her credit for an enormous number\nof conflicts.\" Well, why not, if we are to accept the extremest\npsychoanalytic theory that all creations of fiction, poetry and\nart are determined by complexes and conflicts ? If, on the\ncontrary, the scores of fictitious \" entities \" who talk and\nact each after his own fashion in the pages of a Dickens are\nnot thus deterministically inevitable, but are to a large extent due\nto free creative fancy, the same could be true of the medium.\nBut if the investigator is convinced that the entities \" fitted\nso well into the moods and experiences of the patient \" he is\ncertainly right in declaring that \" this is something which we\nhave yet to explain,\" and in intimating that this is very hard\nto explain on the theory that what was going on in the medium's\nmind had no real relation to what had happened during the\nlatter years of the patient's experience.\nThis is the point which I have found so difficult to persuade\nmy psychoanalyst friends, earnestly bent on their well-trodden\npath, to glance at and discover. A purported communicator\nthrough a medium says, inter alia, that she had a cat named\n\" Mephistopheles,\" at the same time lets slip the name\n\" Teddy,\" and declares that shortly before death deceased\nrelatives were present in her room helping her, and that after\nher death the secretary of the seances (whose office, as the\nmedium knew, was in the same building with the rooms of\nthe communicator's family) sometimes, after washing her hands,\nwent and looked at her picture. The psychoanalyst says, \" If\nI could have the opportunity and take the time to analyse\nthe medium, I am sure I could account for all these mental\nimages by her experiences in the past, that I could evoke\ntheir origins from the unconscious.\" And I verily believe that,\ngive him time and patience, he would be able to present a\npretty appearance of success. Some time or other, by the\n2 0\n\f394 Reviews. [part\nlanes of free association, which can touch any of millions of\nlittle experiences of a lifetime, he might find that she once saw\na cat in a fit, that \" acted like the devil.\" That Theodore\nRoosevelt, popularly called \" Teddy,\" had been much admired\nby her. That she cherished grateful recollections of the tender\ncare lavished upon her by relatives when she was ill. That\nshe had a mother-fixation. And the corroboratory and\ncumulative significance of the annexed allusion to water, that\nwell-known maternal symbol ! Granted that these or other\nplausibilities could be found by ingenuity and industrious\nsearching, yet they would not avail in the least to explain the\nactual and literal (not constructive and metaphorical) corres-\npondence of the statements to external facts unknown to the\nmedium. The facts were that the last cat ever owned by the\ncommunicator, many years ago, ivas named Mephistopheles, that\none of the only two dogs ever owned in her household was\nnamed Teddy, that she did a few days before her death tell\nher foster-daughter that (deceased) relatives had been in her\nroom assisting her, and that the secretary had often gone up\ninto the rooms of her family after her death, and (after\nperforming certain services for her daughter) washed her hands\nand then gazed earnestly at the communicator's portrait as she\npassed it. Dr. Burns is logically warranted in regarding so\nmany correspondences between the utterances of the medium\nand facts related to the patient as exceedingly difficult to\nexplain without recourse to occult agencies or processes. He\nthus puts it :\n\" Telepathy, television, telaudience, may explain\nparts of this but neither is a logical explanation of the whole,\nnor will they put together be much more satisfactory. We are\nstill left with our problem unsolved.\"\nLeaving correspondences to \" moods \" aside, in relation to\nwhich category the investigator does not render much assistance,\nlet us give a little attention to the correspondences with\n\" experiences.\" But seeing that in nearly all instances we are\ndependent upon the word of the patient J.D., and we have\nbeen told that \" he may not be considered absolutely reliable,\"\nwhat guarantee have we of the facts ? When we learn that\nno grounds developed for considering him unduly suggestible,\nthat he acknowledged the truth of statements not at all to\nhis credit (and, I may interject, no reasons appear for ascribing\n\fno] Reviews. 395\nulterior motives to his denial of other statements), that his\ntemporary interest in Spiritualism soon waned and became\ndistaste, that the sympathy between him and Dr. Bull was not\nextended to the medium, and that he became dissatisfied\nbecause of the slowness in the improvement of his health, we\nmay agree with Dr. Burns in feeling that \" he may be in\nnearly all instances accepted as honest.\"\nOne important set of statements, which cannot be called\nlikely, was indeed established independently of the patient.\nThese, scattered through seances 30 to 43, referred to a dis-\neased genito-urinal condition. The patient denied having had\nsuch a trouble, and Dr. Bull found no reason, aside from the\nmediumistic statements, for suspecting it. On the strength of\nthese statements, however, he sent J.D. to a surgeon unaffi-\nliated with himself. The correspondences between what the\n\" messages \" had said and what the surgeon found may be\nthus condensed :\nMedium :\n\" Physical condition to be cleared up . . . Genito-\nurinary \" (Verified by surgeon's examination). M. \" Not a\nserious condition \" {Dr. K \" Mild \"). M. \" A constriction\n\"\n{Dr. K. \"A slight snugness in the posterior urethra ... I\nwould advise '\ndilatation '\n\"). M.\n\" Constriction increased by\na slight inflammation \" {Dr. K. \" Urethritis \"). M. \" Insistence\nthat this condition should be attended to \" {Dr. K. Regarded\nthis as advisable, and gave fifteen local treatments within the\nnext few months).\nAnother class of statements is protected from the suspicion\nof too much acquiescence in the replies of the patient, by the\ndisclosures he had made to Dr. Bull before the medium was\ncalled in. The medium in the early sittings declared that\nJ.D. had been afraid to go to sleep, that he heard words\nordering him to do things against his inclination, that voices\nalso threatened him, that he had been addicted to drink, that\nhe had been injuriously affected by his social habits, etc.\nUnfortunately we are not told whether or not this was the\nmedium's first work for Dr. Bull, but even though she knew\nthat the patient had more than usual likelihood of being\nsubject to hallucinations or hysterical symptoms she seems,\nfrom what we are told, to have hit the nail with impressive\naccuracy, a number of times.\n\f396 Reviews. [part\nBesides the foregoing, Dr. Burns lists some fifty \" examples \"\nof true statements, regarding the patient's peculiar experiences,\nhis relations to his children and to other persons, to his deceased\nwife, etc. Part of these purported to come directly from\n\" entities \" and part from \" impressions \" received by the\nmedium. Some of them were very specific. That twice since\nthe last sitting he had been influenced by other men to drink,\nwith three or four days between. That his \" boss \" had com-\nplimented him, and that the same man had a bad temper and\ndisobeyed a rule not to smoke at the place of work. That\nthe patient heard no voices for four days, the fifth and sixth\nday heard voices, and thereafter no more to the date of\nsitting. That he had wakened feeling a whirling sensation,\nfollowed by a sense of freedom. There are many statements\nof peculiar symptomatic experiences, some of them assigned\nto the influence of particular obsessors, and often with designa-\ntion of the time they occurred or the length of their duration,\nfollowed by the patient's acknowledgment. The deceased wife's\nname was given, the manner of her death described fairly well.\nIt was also correctly stated that J.D. vised to cry when he\nhad done things not right, and that he no longer had her\npicture (it had been lost). Many facts were given about his\nboys, of specific and in part of fairly striking character.\nDr. Burns says that in all more than sixty impressions and\nupwards of a hundred direct statements of controls in reference\nto the patient and his contemporaneous environment proved\ncorrect, and that there were only eleven such false statements,\nwhich he lists. By letter he informs me that the impressions\nand statements referred to are differentiated ones.\nThus this case seems to have developed, making all allow-\nances for possible inferences, a considerable body of evidence\nfor the display of knowledge on the part of the medium which\ncould not have been acquired in ordinary ways. In this\nrespect I probably rate it more highly than does Dr. Burns,\nbut on the assumption that the records were carefully kept and\nthat he subjected both them and other sources to a rigid\nexamination. On the contrary, scientific proof that the entities,\nother than the wife, were the persons whom they claimed to\nbe is almost entirely lacking. In this respect the case reported\nin Bulletin IX. of the Boston Society for Psychic Research,\n\f110] Reviews. 397\nwherein the same medium is concerned, is in a much more\nfortunate position. There the mediumistic descriptions of\n\" entities \" and other statements concerning them found many\ncorrespondences with known facts regarding deceased persons\nand with apparitions seen by living persons.\nAnd now as to the therapeutical results. The man is not\ncured. His condition is greatly ameliorated. Instead of a\nbabel of voices he now hears but three ;\nthey no longer order\nand threaten him but instead seem to argue over him ^ so that\nonly their presence annoys him ; he is no longer troubled in\nhis work or his sleep.\n^\nWhat is the sigmficance of this improvement ? It is im-\npossible not to agree with Dr. Burns that we can draw no\ncertain conclusions from it, since patients of this type some-\ntimes \" arrive at a stage of relative adjustment \" after the\nordinary modes of treatment.\nAnd I agree, substantially, with what I esteem the most\nimportant of the investigator's general conclusions, based on\nthis case.\nThat it contains no definite proof that spirits were obsessing\nthis patient, though, were spirit communication an independently\nestablished fact, there is sufficient evidence in the case to make\nthat theory a plausible one.

This last article bore the same title as the American\nseries, but a somewhat amended sub-title.^ The issue contain-\ning it was widely distributed through the post among the\nMembers and Associates of the S.P.R. by Dr. Crandon. The\npublicity thus given to these records may in itself justify, apart\nfrom other considerations, an attempt to evaluate the evidence\nput forward in them.\nThis evidence, brought forward as resulting from experiments\nin thought-transference, presents the latest and in many ways\nthe most interesting development in the Margery mediumship,\nwhich has become by far the most comprehensive and versatile\n^ These four articles will be here cited as respectively i, ii, iii, iv,\nfollowed by the nuniber of the page and a letter indicating the column.\n^ There are some minor variations between the American and the\nEnglish texts. But as the latter may have been printed without Dr.\nRichardson's immediate supervision, we will not take these variations\ninto account, and will use the original articles only.\n\f^00 Reviews. [part\non record. This type of evidence was first brought into\nprominence by Mrs. Verrall in her notable paper \" On a Series\nof Automatic Writings,\" forming vol. xx of Proceedings (1906).i\nIt has therefore been before students of psychical research for\nover twenty years ; but we believe we are right in saying that\nthis is the first time during the whole of that period that any\nsubstantial body of phenomena, even remotely resembling the\nS.P.R. cross-correspondences, has been produced outside the\nS.P.R.2 The appearance of this series of articles is therefore\nof considerable interest to those who beheve that the S.P.E.\ncross-correspondences form perhaps the most important body of\nevidence bearing on the problem of survival. At the same\ntime we must not allow this gratification to prevent us from\nexamining as closely, and criticising as unsparingly, this evidence\nproduced outside the Society, as we examine and criticise that\nproduced within it.\nIt is proper to point out at the outset that the Margery\ncross-correspondences are very different from those of the S.P.R.\nThe latter are taken from a mass of rambling material produced\nfor the most part spontaneously, they straggle over years, and\ndisplay many loose ends. The former are experimentally pro-\nduced, they are compact, slick, and observe the unities of time.\nThus the Margery phenomena are much easier to study, much\neasier to record, and, it may be added, much easier to plan\nthan are those of the S.P.R. And this we certainly do not\nput forward as an objection ; on the contrary, it would be\nunreasonable to expect all communicators to produce and all\ngroups of investigators to elucidate material as full of historical,\nliterary, and classical allusions as the S.P.R. scripts. Indeed,\nwe welcome this simplification and the wide publicity given to\nthese phenomena if only because they may attract a few indi-\nviduals to a study of the records published by the S.P.R.\nBut there is another difference between the two sets of\nphenomena, and this time a vital difference. The case for the\nS.P.R. cross -correspondences rests ultimately on the bona fides\n1 The name \" cross-correspondence \" is however slightly older : see\nMr. J. G. Piddington's paper \"On the Types of Phenomena displayed\nm Mrs. Thompson's Trance,\" Proc. S.P.R. (1904), xviii. 294.\n'The cross-correspondence reported by Dr. Geley were on a much\nsmaller scale (Contribution d VHude des correspondences croisees [Paris 1914]).\n\fuo] Revieivs. 401\nof the automatists and of those who study and pubHsh the\nmaterial produced by them, and it has been freely admitted\nthat substantially similar results could be obtained by fraudu-\nlent collusion between the S.P.R. automatists and commentators.\nThe aim of Dr. Richardson, on the other hand, was to dis-\ncover a fraud-proof technique for the production of cross-\ncorrespondences. Thus, he writes at the outset, after discussing\nthe validity of any theory of fraud, that \" The first requisite\n... is to fiu-nish a device upon which Walter [Margery's\ncontrol] could, in the dark, indicate a specific number, in such\na fashion that even were Margery conscious she could not know\nwhat this number was. Such a device was found . . .\n\"\n(i. 256a). The attempt to anticipate sriticism, failing a general\nconsensus of opinion as to the bona fides of the persons con-\ncerned, by making the experiment fraud-proof, is of course\naltogether praiseworthy. But the making of such an attempt\nis an invitation to judge the evidence produced purely on the\nbasis of the reliability or otherwise of the methods of control\nused, apart from any questions of good faith. Dr. Richardson\nvery frankly directs the reader's attention to this {e.g. ii. 3556).\nOur first duty, therefore, is to inquire whether the procedure\nadopted was in reality fraud-proof, as Dr. Richardson claims, or\nrather whether the evidence as presented to the reader by Dr.\nRichardson demonstrates it to have been fraud-proof. We shall\nhave occasion to indicate later certain deficiencies in the evi-\ndence as presented which are from this point of view serious.\nIt may be convenient at this point to remind readers who\nhave not followed the history of the Margery case in detail,\nthat \" Margery \" is Mrs. Crandon's mediumistic pseudonym, and\nthat when in trance she piu-ports to be controlled by her dead\nbrother, Walter. Dr. Richardson explains (i. 256a) that it\noccurred to him that Walter should give \" post-hypnotic \" sug-\ngestions to Margery whilst she was in trance. Now, however\nconvinced Dr. Richardson may be of the independent existence\nof Walter, it is not possible to say to which of two personali-\nties (Walter and Margery) operating through one physical\norganism (Mrs. Crandon) are to be attributed any supernormal\npowers of cognition which Mrs. Crandon may manifest in trance,^\n1 This has been recognised in the case of the \"book-tests\" given\nthrough Mrs. Leonard.\n\f402 Reviews. [part\nand any attempt to demonstrate the influence of \"hypnotic\"\nsuggestions by Walter on Margery is a manifest impossibility.\nTo return to Dr. Richardson's description of his fraud-proof\ndevice : this took the shape of a perpetual calendar, having an\nexposed figure which could be changed by turning a knob at\nthe side. \" If some sitter first turns this handle arbitrarily in\nthe dark seance-room, and if the calendar is then passed over\nto Walter who turns it further, neither Walter nor the other\nperson can normally know, save by pre-arrangement, what\nnumber is brought into view\" (i. 256 a-6). This is quite true,\nalthough even here, it will be noticed, we are asked to make\nan assumption : the absence of pre-arrangement. Such an\nassumption, we need hardly point out, can have no place in a\nfraud-proof technique. But, if the assumption be made, this\ndevice has considerable merits. Dr. Richardson, however, hav-\ning made this interesting suggestion, at once drops it, and\nproceeds to say a few lines lower, \" It was my proposal that\nWalter, himself, in the dark, turn the calendar ...\" (i. 2566).\nThis calendar was abandoned altogether after the first sitting\nin favour of \"a daily calendar with individual sheets, numbers\n1 to 31, suspended on metal rings ...\" (i. 2596), the change\nbeing made at Walter s request because he \" disliked to touch\nmetal with his terminals \" (i. 2596). Is it suggested that this\nchange made the procedure less open to fraud ?\nTo the calendar Dr. Richardson added six white cards, on\neach of which he drew a simple geometrical figure. It was\nproposed that Walter turn the calendar to any number, and\nthat he select one of the six cards. Walter was then to put\nthe calendar and the card into a box. \" At the end of the\nsitting, while Margery was still in trance, he was to indicate\nsilently to her the number and the figure which he had selected\nand cognised . . . downstairs, after the seance, Margery would\nthen try, by process more or less analogous to automatic writ-\ning, to draw the figure and write the number ; and the element\nof post-hypnotic timing was to be introduced by Walter sug-\ngesting to her that she do this after the lapse of a number of\nminutes indicated by the calendar number chosen by him\n\"\n(i. 2566). We need not repeat that it is quite impossible, by\nany such procedure, to prove the independence of Walter.\nLater it occurred to Dr. Richardson to wonder whether these\n\f110] Reviews. 403\nexperiments might not be carried out with two or more\nmediums. The procedure adopted will emerge from a summary\nof a typical case. On the 17th of February 1928, Margery\ngave a sitting at her house in Boston in the presence of twelve\npersons, of whom four were \" slightly back of the main circle\n\"\n(ii. 354a). Dr. Crandon and Dr. Richardson sat at either side\nof Margery. \"A new sheaf of calendar pages had been brought\nin together with a new set of geometrical cards. These were\nshuffled before the sitting by Miss Silsbee, and were then put\nin her custody in a closed box. Later, when instructed to\ndo so, she placed this box on the seance table ; and when\nWalter had indicated that he was finished with the contents,\nshe put the cover on and the covered box again remained in\nher charge, until opened in due course after the seance\n\"\n(ii. 354a). Walter announced that he \" would make up a\nproblem,\" to which two other psychics, Valiantine in New\nYork and Hardwicke at Niagara Falls \" would each give half\nthe answer \" (ii. 354a-6). Walter then \" worked over \" the\ncontents of the box, this part of the sitting ending at 9.40,\nand the group went downstairs. There Margery wrote \"11x2=\"\nand \" to kick a dead \" (ii. 3546) : the writing began at 10.5,\nand at 10.38 the box was opened. In it were found, in that\norder, the calendar sheet bearing the number 11, a geome-\ntrical card bearing an x, and the calendar number 2. At 10.50\nDr. Crandon telephoned to New York and was informed that\nValiantine, sitting in that city, had said at 9.40, \" The Kid is\nout ah-eady \" (ii. 355a). Between 9.57 and 9.59 he had written,\n\"2\u2014No one ever stops to\u2014Walter \" (ii. 355a). At 11.49 the\nBoston group received a telegram from Niagara Falls reading :\n\" Nine forty five\u2014H O stop R stop S E 2 \" (ii. 3556). This\nreferred to the script produced by Dr. Hardwicke sitting at\nNiagara Falls.i It will be seen that Walter had thus faithfully\ncarried out his promise, the three mediums between them having\nproduced the equation 11x2=22, and the phrase, \"No one\never stops to (to) kick a dead horse.\"\nDr. Richardson comments on this episode as follows (ii. 3556) :\n\"It is of some importance that this spontaneous subject matter\n1 Although the telegram seems to indicate that the script was pro-\nduced at 9.45, we are told in the text (ii. 3.55o) that tlie medium did\nnot go into trance until 9.50.\n\f404 Reviews.

Supposing it had been pre-arranged that Valiantine\nand Hardwicke should each write the figure 2, all that was\nnecessary at Boston was that one of thirteen persons sitting in\na dark room, and not in a continuous circle, should be able to\nselect a calendar page or card, or combination of pages or\ncards, making twenty-two.i We are told nothing as to the\ndegree of accessibility of the box during the sitting upstairs,\nnothing as to the nature of the control (if any) to which the\nmedium was subjected, except that she sat between Dr.\nRichardson and Dr. Crandon. We are not told who supplied\nthe calendar pages and the geometrical cards. Surely Dr.\nRichardson, after all his experience as sitter and controller,\nmust reaHse that the facts as he sets them out are a ludi-\ncrously insufficient basis for a claim that pre-arrangement was\nimpossible.\nNor is ^3re-arrangement the only form of possible collusion.\nBetween the time that the upstairs sitting ended, and the\ndownstairs sitting began, there was an interval of twenty-five\nminutes,^ and there was another interval of thirty-three minutes\nbetween the beginning of the writing downstairs and the open-\ning of the box. Can Dr. Richardson account for the where-\nabouts of all the thirteen persons during the whole of these\ntwo intervals, so as to be positive that none of them had an\nopportunity of passing on a telephone message to New York\nor Niagara Falls in time to be used at the sittings in those\nplaces, and that none of them had access to the box except\nMiss Silsbee ?\nEven this does not exhaust the possibilities of collusion.\nDr. Crandon telephoned to New York at 10.50. It is essential\n^Thus, instead of 11x2, any of the following equations would Jiave\nmet the case: 10 + 12, 20+2, 11+11, and many others.\n2 This breaking up of the group and adjournment to a room on\nanother floor is a frequent feature of the Boston sittings, and a most\nregrettable one in experiments designed to exclude collusion, especially\nwhen, as often happened, the sitters were niunerous.\n\f110] Reviews. 405\nfor Dr. Richardson's case that an exact account of the conver-\nsation between Dr. Crandon and his New York interlocutor\nshould be given and attested by witnesses present at each end\nduring the conversation, so as to be sure that no leading ques-\ntions were put. But this is not done.\nWe do not wish to affirm that any one of these three\napparent opportunities for collusion was in fact utilised ; it is\nfor Dr. Richardson to show that none of them was and could\nhave been utilised, and this he has failed to do. As regards,\nhowever, Dr. Hardwicke's share in the experiment, there are\ntwo suspicious facts which may be capable of an innocent\ninterpretation, but cei\"tainly require explanation of some kind.\nFirst, a telegram purports to be sent at 9.45 giving the result\nof a sitting which, according to Dr. Richardson, only began at\n9.50. Secondly, the Niagara Falls script, which was tele-\ngraphed thus : ''HO stop R stop S E 2,\" was in fact pro-\nduced thus (ii. 3556), on two separate pieces of paper ;\nIt was surely strange to communicate this script telegraphically\nby starting with the lower part of the first sheet, proceeding\nto the second, and concluding with the top part of the first ?\nHow could it have been known that horse was the word\nrequired ? It may be urged that the object was to make\nsense ; but how could the Niagara Falls group have known\nwhat combination of the elements of this script would make\nsense in combination with the Boston and New York scripts ?\nIt must be concluded that the conditions, as recorded, of this\ncase, which is entirely typical, are very far indeed from being\nfraud-proof.\nWe now come to two experiments (ii. 356a and iii. 4156) in\nwhich Walter was to select the subject for the cross-correspon-\ndence in Margery's absence. The procedure in each case was\nas follows. Before the sitting a certain Captain X marked\n\f406 Reviews. [part\nsome blaiik cards for the purpose of identification and gave\nthem to his employees to paste designs on the other side.\nWhen this had been done, the cards were put in a box which\nwas sealed and handed to Captain X, who, it is said, did not\nknow what designs his employees had pasted on.^ The box\nwas opened at the sitting and the lights turned out. Captain X\nthen picked one card \" at random \" out of the box and handed\nit to another member of the circle, who kept it concealed until\nthe result of the Margery sitting held elsewhere the same even-\ning was known. When the results were received from New\nYork and Niagara Falls it was found that Margery, Valiantine,\nand Hardwicke had between them produced a cross-correspon-\ndence tallying with the card drawn by Captain X.\nNow clearly everything turns in these two cases on the good\nfaith of the anonymous Captain X.^ As the cards had been\nprepared in Captain X's office it would have been prudent to\nhave excluded him altogether from the sittings at which the\ncards were to be drawn. If admitted to these sittings, he was\nthe last person in the world who ought to have been allowed\naccess to the box when opened, access to the box ivhen the\nlights were out. Everything recorded by Dr. Richardson is\ncompatible with the cards handed by Captain X to his fellow-\nsitters never having been in the box at all. The relevant card\ncould have been in Captain X's pocket when the sitting began.\nThe number of cards in the box was not independently checked\non either occasion, so that we need not even suppose substitu-\ntion, although this would have been easy.\nTo turn from particular cases to the general nature of the\nreports submitted by Dr. Richardson, it is obvious that in\nexperiments of this kind, designed to exclude collusion, we\nought to have before us copies of the original records of all\n^ He had, however, made private marks on the cards, for purposes of\nidentification ; these marks shoukl clearly have been made by an inde-\npendent person.\n^ It seems a piece of needless mystification to suppress Captain X's\nname in these records. His real name is given in another series of\nrecords of the Margery mediumship in which phenomena quite as re-\nmarkable as these cross-correspondences also rest largely on his authority.\nThe responsibility for these two independent types of supernormal\nphenomena is thus given the appearance of being divided between two\nindividuals, who are in fact only one.\n\f110] Reviews. 407\nthe sittings at different places, signed by all the persons\npresent, with the exact time of the occurrences at each sitting.\nReports that do not fulfil these conditions, and Dr. Richardson's\nreports fall far short of this, are worthless, except in so far as\nthey throw light on the standards of evidence which satisfy\nDr. Richardson and his collaborators. It must in particular\nbe emphasised that in these particular experiments time is an\nessential point. Where telephonic communication admittedly\noccurs between the groups at the several places the time of every\nincident should be noted to the minute. For instance, in one\nexperiment (iv. 5026) Mr. Bird, at the Boston sitting, chose a\nproverb, which was given the same evening at Niagara Falls\nby Dr. Hardwicke, and the signed record of the Hardwicke\nsitting is on this occasion reproduced (iv. 506, figure 22). This\nrecord gives the date (\" Mar. 24, 1928 \"), but not the time in\nhours and minutes. Much is made of the poiiat that eight\nminutes before the Boston sitting closed a telegram had been\nreceived from Hardwicke, but this telegram merely said (iv. 5036):\n\" Characters stop drawing stop am mailing.\" It is therefore no\nevidence that Mr. Bird's proverb had already been given at\nNiagara Falls. This omission to time the records exactly is\nhere particularly unfortunate, as the case would appear to be\nan impressive one but for the evidential defect as to the vital\nelement of time.\nWe have finally to refer to the climax of these experiments,\nthe Chinese scripts of Margery It would obviously be im-\nproper for one who is not a Chinese scholar to enter very\nclosely into these phenomena. It will suffice to quote the\nwords of Mr. R. F. Johnston, Government House, Weihaiwei,\nan Associate of the S.P.R., who concludes, after a long and\nexhaustive analysis ^ of these scripts, that \" whoever the com-\nmunicator on this occasion may have been, he was certainly\nnot the great Chinese sage [Confucius] whose name he adopted.\n1 It is not uninteresting to note that these Chinese scripts began in\nMarch 1928, a few months after the pubHcation of Mr. Hall's criticisms\nof the S.P.R. cross-correspondences, in which he suggests certain tests\ninvolving the co-operation of a Chinese. Is Mr. Hall also among the\nprophets ? Or is this another cross-correspondence ?\n^ Mr. Johnston's report is filed in the S.P.R. Rooms, and is available\nfor examination by Members and Associates.\n\f408 Reviews. [part\nIt is also too obvious to need emphasis that the style of writ-\ning is not ancient, that the whole contents of the script consist\nof ordinary modern Chinese written by a very poor scribe, and\nthat both pages of script contain not a single word or line\n(barring a trifling exception . . . ) that is not a quotation.\nThe sentences written by Margery are all taken word for word\nfrom a famous classical work which is probably more familiar\nthan any other Chinese book, not only to all educated Chinese,\nbut also to all Western students of Chinese literature.\" After\nthis it is perhaps superfluous to refer to the fact which\nemerges incidentally in a later article, not part of the series\nunder review, that Margery has a Japanese servant, who\nadmittedly knows a certain amount of Chinese.^\nThis review does not pretend to exhaust the flaws that are\nto be found in these experiments, nor the criticisms, from one\npoint of view or another, that might be levelled at them. But\neven such points as have been brought forward show clearly\nthat this latest development of the Margery mediumship is still\nfar from reaching an adequate standard of evidence. We hope,\nnevertheless, that these experiments will be continued, under\nimproved conditions. At the same time Dr. Richardson would,\nwe suggest, do well to realise that the non-American reader\nwould be more predisposed to accept the phenomena if it could\nbe shown that among those persons who have had an adequate\nopportunity in America for forming a judgment, there is a\ngeneral consensus in favour of the credibility and the bona fides\nof all mediums and sitters concerned.^\nTheodore Bestebman.\n* \" The Chinese Scripts by Margery,\" Psychic Research (October 1928),\nxxii. 5736.\n8 Since this review was written these articles and others have been\noff-printed as a volume entitled The Thumbprint and Cross-Correspondence\nExperiments Made with the Medium Margery During 1927 and 1928.

Incidentally, however, I was\nenabled to have sittings with a considerable number of\nmediums, and it is with these sittings that the present\nreport is concerned. I do not, however, refer to all the\nsupposed mediums I saw, but only to those who appear\nto have some real claim to the possession of supernormal\nfaculties or whose phenomena ^ are of special interest.\nThe accounts of these mediums follow in the chronological\norder in which I saw them.\nI made two rules to govern my conduct during these\nsittings : (1) to obey scrupulously any conditions made by\nthe medium or his friends ; and (2) to inform the medium\nor his friends of any adverse conclusions I might be\nobUged to adopt. I beheve that I did not anywhere\nbreak these two rules ; but this is not to say that the\nmedium's friends were always satisfied. I was reproached\non one occasion for stating my views too soon, on another\nfor not revealing my opinion until the conclusion of the\nsittings. On the other hand, it is gratifying to be able to\n^ I apologise for this misuse of the word \" phenomena ;\n\" the only\nexcuse I can put forward is that the continuous iteration of \" alleged\nsupernormal phenomena \" would be as painful to the reader as to the\nwriter.\n411\n0\n\f412 Preface [PAET\nrecord that the mediums and their controlhng spirits (if\nany) everywhere expressed themselves fully satisfied with\nmy behaviour.\nIt must of course be understood that any opinion I\nexpress of the mediums discussed is intended to apply only\nto the sittings at which I was present ; I do not pretend\nto generalise.\nAt the beginning of my journey I wrote to Dr. Albert\nMoll in connection with the technique for clairvoyance which\nCount von Klinckowstroem told me Dr. Moll had devised.\nIn reply the latter very kindly sent me two test-tubes\nmarked I and II, one containing a message known to\nDr. Moll, and the other, at my request, a message un-\nknown to him. I had no idea of the contents of either\ntest-tube, and am still ignorant of the contents of No. I.\nThese tubes were so closed, with a cement mould, that\nDr. Moll considers it impossible for them to be opened\nwithout his subsequent knowledge. It was my intention\nto ask as many clairvoyants as possible to give me\ntheir impressions of the contents of these tubes. Unfor-\ntunately, their rather fear-inspiring appearance aroused the\nsuspicions of the mediums (as well as of the Customs\nofficials at various frontiers), and I was able to induce\nonly a single medium to try her faculties on the tubes.\nThe result of this single experiment, with Frau Ignath, is\ndetailed in Section VIII below.\nI cannot conclude this Preface without expressing my\ngrateful thanks to the anonymous donor and to the Council\nof the Society for having given me the opportunity of\nmaking this, to me, most instructive journey ; and to\nMiss Isabel Newton for valuable criticisms of this Report.\n\fin] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 413\nI. MME. Kj^HL-TOUKHOLKA :\n^ PARIS\nFIRST SITTING.\nThe name of this lady having been given to me in\nBrussels by Count Perovsky, I wrote to her before going\nto Paris, and eventually called on her by appointment on\nthe 5th of October, 1928, accompanied by a gentleman who\nwishes to remain anonymous. We were then under the\nimpression that Mme. Kahl was a spiritualistic medium,\nand a series of misunderstandings following on this and\non the language difficulties (my companion knowing no\nFrench and the medium, who is Russian, only a little),\nled to a brief and completely negative interview. But\nhaving been very favourably impressed by M. and Mme.\nKahl-Toukholka, I determined to call again, and did so\non the 10th of October, 1928, without notice, and accompanied\nby M. Rene WarcolHer, who had not previously seen or\nheard of Mme. Kahl. Mme. Kahl very kindly agreed to\ngive us a sitting there and then.\nSECOND SITTING.\nAt this sitting notes were taken sometimes by M.\nWarcollier and sometimes by myself. During a brief\nreturn to London the day after the sitting I compiled,\nfrom my own notes and from memory, a report ^ for sub-\nmission to Council. The following account is based on\nthis report. Subsequently M. Warcolher kindly sent me\na full accoimt ^ based on his notes ; his report corresponds\n1 I believe the only published account of Mme. KahFs mediumship is\na note by her husband, S. Toukholka, \" Experiences de clairvoyance\navec Mme. Olga Kahl,\" Revue Metapsychique (Paris, Novembre-\nDecembre 1922), pp. 429-433, which he has discussed since my proofs\nwere passed (see his \" Ce que la Medecine doit attendre de I'etude\nexperimentale des proprietes psychiques paranormales de I'homme,\"\nRevue Metapsychique (Paris, Mars-Avril, 1929), pp. 124-136). Dr. Osty\nhas carried out a series of experiments with Mme. Kahl.\n^ These reports and all other similar papers later referred to are preserved\nand filed in the Rooms of the S.P.R.\n\f414 Theodore Besterman [part\nvery closely to mine, and I have noted the only divergence\nof any importance.'-\nThe sitting opened with a request from Mme. Kahl to\nme to think of a geometrical figure ; I thought of an\nequilateral triangle, and in a few seconds a red ovaloid\nfigure, giving the effect of a subcutaneous suffusion of the\nblood, appeared on her inner forearm. [M. WarcolHer made\na sketch of this figure, which appears to be closer to a\ntriangle than my description of it as \" ovaloid.\" This is\nM. Warcolher's sketch :\nFig. 1.\nThe medium asked me to repeat the experiment, this\ntime telhng her what figure I thought of, and she would\nagain try to make it appear on her arm. I informed her\nthat I had thought of a square, and in a few seconds there\nappeared on her arm, clearly defined, and, as usual, in\nred, three sides of a square. Mme. Kahl heightened the\nred colour of these outhnes by rubbing them with her hand\n;\nbut there was no contact before the appearance of the\ndesigns.\nI was then asked to think of a common French Christian\nname, and to tell it to M. WarcolHer. While Mme. Kahl\nwas out of the room (which measures about 15 ft. by\n20 ft.), and M. Kahl on the other side of it, I whispered\n\" Henri.\" When Mme. Kahl returned to the room she\nwalked straight up to us and said \" Henri.\"\nMme. Kahl asked me to write down a name, to show\nthe slip to M. WarcolHer, and then to fold it. This was\ndone while Mme. Kahl left the room and with M. Kahl\nsome distance from us. I then wrote the name of \" Rene\n^ In view of the strilting nature of Mme. Kahl's mediumship I have\nthought it right to report, however briefly, the unsuccessful parts of\nthese sittings as well as the successful ones.\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 415\nMaublanc,\" a gentleman with whom I had recently had some\ncorrespondence (see section XIII below). After showing it\nto M. WarcoUier I folded six times the slip of paper\nbearing the name and kept it in my hand. Mme. Kahl\nthen returned and, closing her eyes, scribbled very rapidly\non a piece of paper. At the second attempt she scrawled\nwhat is clearly \" Maubl ...\" or \" Naubl ...\" The\nmedium then touched the folded paper, which remained\nin my hand, and requested me to hold her wrist. I did\nso, and on her forearm appeared very clearly the capital\nletters REN, each about three-quarters of an inch in\nheight, with a vague final letter showing what might have\nbeen the vertical and the lowest horizontal strokes of a\ncapital E.\nMme. Kahl then produced a set of cards of the general\nsize and appearance of playing cards ; these cards,\nhowever, bear on the white side a large central spot of\nink, usually black, though one or two have a red spot,\nbeneath it what appear to be Oriental signs, a letter of\nthe alphabet in one corner (so that the whole pack forms\nthe complete alphabet), and a question in Russian, French\nor English. Mme. Kahl asked M. Warcolher to choose one\nof the questions, to concentrate on the black spot on the\ncard bearing this question, to replace the card in the pack,\nand then to shuffle the latter. Then, holding the pack in\nher hand, Mme. Kahl answered the question. This pro-\ncedure was followed in nearly all subsequent experiments\nwith these cards. M. Warcolher had chosen the card\nbearing the question \" Guerira-t-il (ou elle) ?\n\" [Will he\n(or she) recover ?] Mme. Kahl did not at first succeed in\ndetermining what question had been chosen, and asked\nM. Warcolher to write it down, which he did in the\nfeminine form, thinking of his wife. The medium then\nplaced the pack against her forehead, and declared that\nthe question was about a person who was ill, that this\nperson was a woman, in bed, but not continuously, and\nthat she had always been ill. This is all correct ;\nMme.\nKahl added some details as to the nature of the illness,\nbut these, though probably accurate, cannot be positively\ndeclared to be so.\n\f416 Theodore Besterman [part\nMme. Kahl then asked M. Warcollier to pick out the\ncard bearing the initial of the Christian name of his wife.\nM. WarcolUer took the card marked G and was requested\nto concentrate on it by itself. Mme. Kahl wrote C, then\nsaid K, and finally wrote G. She did not succeed in getting\nthe name, which is Germaine. The medium then suggested\nthat she might be more successful if I also knew the name.\nWhile Mme. Kahl left the room, M. Kahl remaining, M.\nWarcolHer whispered the name to nie, and I wrote it on\na piece of paper which remained in my hand. The\nmedium returned and, looking into my eyes, said re-\npeatedly :\n\" Genriette, Genriette,\" and protested that there\nis no such name. The name of my wife is Henrietta,\nwhich, in French, is Henriette, the initial H not being pro-\nnounced. Genriette is therefore G plus the name of my\nwife. I had not been consciously thinking of her name.\nMme. Kahl next asked me to think of a woman ; I\nthought of my wife. She filled a small glass of water,\ndropped a gold ring into it, and looked into the glass.\nShe declared that she saw in it a fair woman with short\nhair, which is true of my wife. Then Mme. Kahl tried\nto see Mme. Warcollier, and said that she saw a dark\nwoman wearing her hair long, which is also accurate.\nThe medium asked me to think of a short name ;\nI\nthought of Neil, as probably unknown to her. Mme. Kahl\nat once made several scrawls, each beginning with a\nvery emphatic N, and one continuing with an e ; but she\nwas unable to get any more. The medium explained that\nshe was only able to perceive names which were known\nto her. The experiment was repeated, the name I\nthought of being Leon. Mme. Kahl wrote L and then\nLucien.\nMme. Kahl asked M. WarcolUer to draw, in pencil, a\nsimple figure. M. Warcollier made five dots, thus :\nThe medium found the piece of paper too large and the\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 417\ndots were remade on a scrap of paper about an inch\nsquare ; I placed the first piece of paper in my pocket.\nThe object of this change, Mme. Kahl explained, was to\nenable her to hold the piece of paper, when folded, between\nher finger and thumb without there being any suspicion\nthat she was reading it. M. Warcolher was then asked to\nplace his hand, containing the shp, under a rug, to take\nher hand under the rug, and to place her finger on the\ndesign. This proved a total failure.\nMme. Kahl asked me to repeat the test ;\nI drew a\nrectangular figure, and, after completing it, produced two\nof the sides so as to form a cross, thus :\nThe piece of paper on which tlais design was made, again\nabout an inch square, was folded and held by me on her\nforehead. At once the medium said that she saw a\nrectangular figure with a cross at one corner, and drew\nthe following figure :\nShe made it clear, both verbally and in her manner of\ndrawing the figure, that the cross was intentional, and not\na mere accident.\nAt this point we were about to leave, when Mme. Kahl\nexclaimed that she could now give us an example of the\nmanner in which her faculty sometimes very strongly\n\" got hold of her.\" She declared positively that there was\nFig. 2.\nFig. 3.\n\f418 Theodore Besterman [part\nnow in the waiting-room a man who had come to consult\nher in order to ascertain whether he was to expect a\nletter, whether he was to marry, and to ask a question\nabout a commercial matter. We at once went into the\nwaiting room and requested the gentleman whom we\nfound there to write down the questions he had come to\nask. He willingly assented, and wrote the following :\ntrouverais-je un emploi ?\nrecevrais-je une lettre ?\ndois-je faire le commerce ?\nMe marierais-je ?\n^\n[Signed]\nThis gentleman then went into the other room, M. War-\ncollier and I remaining in conversation with M. Kahl. In\na moment or two the gentleman returned and said that\nMme. Kahl had asked him to tell us his Christian name.\nThis, he said, was Fernand. Hard on his heels came Mme.\nKahl, who exclaimed, \" Your name is Fernand.\" This\nconcluded the sitting.\nIn general, sittings at which occur whispering between\nthe sitters, the writing down of the required information,\nand systems such as that of Mme. Kahl's cards, cannot\nbe taken very seriously. I think, however, that an\nanalysis of the present sitting will show it to contain\nelements of some interest. I cannot, of course, do more than\nassert that although I am fully conscious of the possibilities\nof hypersesthesia, I am nevertheless of the opinion that on\nthe two occasions on which whispering took place, it was\ndone in such a way as to make it impossible for\nM. and Mme. Kahl to hear it, the latter, moreover, having\non each occasion been out of the room. Then, although I\nbeheve that no signalhng occurred between M. and Mme.\nKahl after the latter's return, I should not care to\nguarantee this. M. Kahl's continuous presence was un-\ndoubtedly regrettable.\nThe writing of the slips was always done on a small\npad provided by Mme. Kahl, but not, as a rule, until the\n1 [Shall I find a job ? Shall I receive a letter ? Ought I to go\ninto business ? Shall I marry ?]\n\fIll] Four Months'' Tour of Psychical Investigation 419\nsheet used had been torn off the pad. A hard surface was\ngenerally used as a support of the paper written on. When\na pencil was intentionally borrowed from Mme. Kahl, it\nwas found that she provided one with a soft lead (Faber\n24) quite unsuitable for the form of fraud which consists\nof reading the blind marks transmitted by a sharp pencil\nto the sheet below the one written on. There were no\nmirrors in the room available for any form of reading by\nreflection.\nMost objectionable of all is the system of cards. Neither\nM. Warcollier nor I was able to detect any trickery ; but\neven a third-rate illusionist can perform such remarkable\nfeats with cards that I, at any rate, am not inchned to\nput too much trust in my own senses in this respect, and\nothers, no doubt, will put even less. Indeed, if Mme.\nKahl's phenomena of this type stood alone, I should\ncertainly not go out of my way to draw attention to\nthem. And it must be added that Mme. Kahl has a\nnumber of mannerisms which almost invite suspicion ; for\ninstance, she often retires for a moment or two into an\ninner room in order to \" concentrate.\" I can say this the\nmore frankly as it is my opinion, in face of all these\nobjections, that the phenomena seen by me at this sitting\nand at the two following ones (with a single possible\nexception, to be noted below) were genuinely supernormal.\nBy this I do not intend to suggest that Mme. Kahl\ninvariably acts with scientific scrupulousness ; a clairvoyante\nwho exploits her faculties commercially is bound to take\nthe line of least resistance, and Mme. Kahl, no doubt,\n\" helps \" herself if her sitters give her the opportunity by\ncarelessness or indiscretion.\nAlthough I did not come to a favourable conclusion\nuntil the fourth sitting, even the present one had greatly\nimpressed me ; for if we take into account only those\nincidents wliich were necessarily genuine\u2014by which I mean\nthose in which the idea successfully transmitted had\nno physical existence, having been present only in the\nmind of M. WarcoUier or of myself\u2014the remaining results\nare still striking. We have, first, the impressive incident\nwhere Mme. Kahl, after having obtained the initial G of\n\f420 Theodore Besterman [part\nthe name of Mine. Warcollier, turned to me and completed\nthe initial with the French form of the name of my own\nwife, of which I had not consciously been thinking. The\nodds against guessing the name Henrietta or Henriette\nmust be well over 100 to 1 ; let us say 50 to 1. Next\nthere is the correct description of my wife as being fair,\nwith short hair, and of Mme. Warcollier as being dark\nand wearing her hair long. The odds against each of these\nsuccesses are probably in the neighbourhood of 3 to 1 ; let\nus be conservative and say 5 to 1 for both together.\nNext is the correct N of Neil, to say nothing of the e.\nThe odds against this are about 20 to 1. Next we have\nthe correct L of Leon, which we will also value at 20 to 1.\nThis method of assessing odds, where it is impossible to\ngive a definite value to chance successes, is admittedly\nunsatisfactory. But at any rate it enables us to reaUse\nmore clearly the general value of such incidents as those\ndescribed. Bearing this in mind, it is not uninteresting to\nsee that, ignoring nearly all the most striking phenomena,\nwe get the minimum odds of 100,000 to 1 against the\nsuccesses just mentioned being due purely to chance.\nThe success obtained was undoubtedly impressive enough\nto justify further experiments, and to these M. and Mme.\nKahl readily assented. Consequently I returned to Paris in\nDecember with the authorisation of Council to undertake\na lengthy series of sittings with Mme. Kahl. I proposed\nto her a few simple conditions, such as that the sittings\nshould take place on neutral ground and in the absence\nof M. Kahl. Unfortunately, from the scientific point of\nview, Mme. Kahl has a large clientele as a professional\nclairvoyante, so that her time is very fully and profitably\noccupied. Having thus no financial interest in the scientific\nestabhshment of her sujjposed supernormal faculties, and\nbeing herself quite indifl^erent to the scientific point of\nview, it is only with the utmost difficulty that she can\nbe induced to submit to any kind of test condition. In\nthe present case Mme. Kahl, after much discussion, was\ninduced to agree to the absence of her husband, but\nrefused to give the sittings elsewhere than in her own\nrooms. Full notes were taken at each sitting by M.\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 421\nWarcolKer and carefully verified immediately after its\nconclusion.\nTHIRD SITTING.\nThe tliird sitting took place on the 21st of December,\n1928, in Mme. Kahl's rooms, in the presence of M.\nWarcollier and of myseK only.\nMme. Kahl asked me to think of a close relative and to\nstate the sex of the person decided upon. This was a\ncousin named Ruth. I had then to pick out from the\npack the card hearing the appropriate initial. Mme. Kahl\nsaid B, then R, and finally wrote Ro. She then attempted\nto describe Ruth, but with Uttle success. On being told\nthe name thought of, the medium said that it was un-\nknown to her, and that she was able to succeed only with\nnames famihar to her.\nI was then requested to choose one of the cards bearing\na question. I selected the question :\n\" Quel emploi dois-je\nchoisir ?\n\" [What occupation shall I choose ?]. This\nexperiment was dropped.\nM. Warcolher, in the same way, chose the question :\n\" Toucherais-je de I'argent ? [Shall I receive some money ?]\nMme. Kahl correctly perceived the question, but her\nanswer was vague and did not correspond to what M.\nWarcolher had in mind. A further question :\n\" Faut-il\nvendre ?\n\" [Should I sell ? ], failed.\nThen, although I have no children, I chose the question :\n\" Mes enfants seront-ils heureux ?\n\" [Will my children be\nhappy ?]. Mme. Kahl laughed and said that I would yet\nhave a child, a boy.\nM. Warcolher was asked to think of the name of a\nperson, and to say whether it was a man or a woman.\nHe did so, and Mme. Kahl said that the name began with\nS ; on being told that this was correct, she added that\nit was Suzanne. This was also correct ; but this latter\nsuccess has only a very restricted value, for Suzanne is one\nof the commonest of the few French feminine Christian\nnames beginning with S.\nM. Warcolher then chose the question :\n\" Mes affaires\niront-elles mieux ?\n\" [Will my business improve ?]. Mme.\n\f422 Theodore Besterman [part\nKahl correctly said that the question was concerned with\nbusiness.\nMme. Kahl asked me to think of a person, to pick out\nthe card bearing the initial letter of this person's name,\nand she would describe him. This experiment failed.\nM. Warcolher wrote on a piece of paper :\n\" Reussirais-je\nune experience telepathic [sic] avec Mr. Besterman Samedi?\"\n[Shall I succeed in a telepathic experiment with Mr.\nBesterman on Saturday ?]. This experiment failed.\nMme. Kahl again tried to discover the name of a person\nwhose initial card I took from the pack, and again failed.\nThe medium now took a glass of water and said that\nshe would try to see in it the woman I love. I thought\nof my wife, but Mme. Kahl failed to see anything, al-\nthough, having correctly, if only in a very fragmentary\nmanner, described my wife on a previous occasion, it\nwould have been easy for her to repeat the description\nshe had given before.\nM. WarcoUier mentally put a question, but Mme. Kahl\nfailed to determine its nature.\nNotwithstanding this series of failures, Mme. Kahl\nconsented to go on, and agreed to attempt a repetition of\nthe previously observed dermographic (skin-writing) pheno-\nmena. I drew a square surmounted by a triangle. On\nMme. Kahl's arm there appeared only three separate\nstrokes, which, however, if joined, would have correctly\nrepresented the triangle of my drawing.\nM. Warcolher now drew a Z, but had in his mind the\nidea of a cross ; on Mme. Kahl's arm appeared the\nfollowing figure :\nI then drew this figure :\nwhich, except for a shght elongation, was exactly repro-\nduced on Mme. Kahl's arm.\nM. Warcolher then thought of his mother, concentrating\non her name, Emihe. Mme. Kahl said A, then F, and\nFig. 4.\n\fIll] Fotir Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 423\nfinally wrote E. On being told that this was correct,\nshe added that the name was Emilie. But in French there\nare very few feminine Christian names beginning with E.\nMme. Kahl now asked me to choose one of the EngUsh\nquestions in the pack, and I selected one which simply\nbore :\n\" Concerning politics.\" The medium asked whether\nthe question was of personal or of general apphcation, and\non being given this information at once said that I had\nchosen a question connected with politics. I took an\nopportunity, later, to examine the pack and found that\n34 cards bore Enghsh questions, and that of these the one\nchosen by me was the only one of an impersonal nature.\nHere, then, we have a case in which it is possible that\nMme. Kahl, after a series of failures, exercised a httle\nmore or less innocent self-help. But it should be observed\nthat if this ivas deception Mme. Kalil's use of so elementary\na trick seems to indicate that she does not use elaborate\nfraud. For if Mme. Kahl has some means of identifying\nwhatever card is taken from the pack or of forcing\nspecific cards on the sitter, as would be necessary if the\nabove-described results were fraudulently obtained, why\nshould she descend to so crude a trick for this particular\ncard ?\nI now drew the following figure on a small piece of\npaper :\nThis I folded and kept in my hand. Mme. Kahl tried to\nmake the design appear on her arm. She was called to\nthe telephone, and after her return this figure gradually\nappeared on her arm :\nFig. 5.\nFig. 6.\nThe telephone is in a passage, just outside the door of the\n\f424 Theodore Besterman [part\nroom in which we sat ; Mme. Kahl remained in my sight\nthe whole time she was out of the room. This concluded\nthe sitting.\nIt will be seen that this sitting was not nearly so\nsuccessful as the previous one. Indeed, on our previous\nsystem of reckoning, that is, excluding all successes in\nwhich the cards, writing or whispering played a part, we\nhave left only three cases, of small importance, in which\nfraud was impossible. First, we have Mme. Kahl's correct\nperception that I have no children. The value of this is,\nof course, very slight. Next is the case where Mme. Kahl\ncorrectly gave the initial and then the complete name of\nSuzanne, the total value of which, with the previous\nincident, is perhaps 40 to 1. Finally we have the correct\ninitial and name of Emihe, but as the initial was obtained\nonly at the third attempt, the total value of this success\nought not to be put higher than, say, 30 to 1. The total\nthus obtained of 1,200 to 1, though interesting enough in\nitself, compares very unfavourably with the 100,000 to 1 of\nthe previous sitting. Mme. Kahl ascribed this lower degree\nof success to the absence of her husband, who usually sMghtly\nhypnotises her and employs suggestion to bring her super-\nnormal faculties into play. And it was also obvious that\nthe consciousness of being under careful scrutiny produced\nin Mme. Kahl an abnormal condition of nervousness and\ndepression, probably unfavourable to the free play of her\nsupernormal faculties. M. Warcolher and I exerted our-\nselves to gain Mme. Kahl's confidence, and, after a good\ndeal of pressure, she consented to continue the series\nunder the same conditions.\nFOURTH SITTING.\nThe fourth sitting was held on the 23rd of December,\nagain in Mme. Kahl's rooms, and with only M. Warcollier\nand myself present.\nMme. Kahl asked me to pick from the pack the card\nbearing the initial of a person I was thinking of. I did\nso, thinking of Professor Pierre Janet, whom I had recently\nseen and whose personality was vividly present in my\nmind. After making a number of incorrect or non-\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 425\nevidential statements aboiit the appearance of M. Janet,\nMme. Kalil said, in quick succession, P, Pierre. I may,\nhowever, have given some tmconscious indication, when\nMme. Kahl said P, that tliis was correct ; and as there\nare only two or three French male Christian names in\ngeneral use beginning svith. P, the latter part of this\nsuccess must not be over-valued. The medium then\nsaid that she would attempt to perceive the surname, and\nasked me to pick out the appropriate initial from the pack.\nOn looking through the cards I found, however, that there\nwas no J amongst them, and I accordingly concentrated\non and replaced the I. It is interesting, therefore, on the\nhyjDothesis of fraud, that ]\\Ime. Kahl did not try any\nnames beginning with I. On the contrary, she wote, at\nthe first attempt, an emphatic J, followed by an illegible\nscrawl ; the second attempt produced Jan ; Mme. Kahl\nthen said Janot ; I stiU expressed dissatisfaction, and was\nasked by Mme. Kahl to write the name ; I did so, but\nMme. Kahl was unable to improve on Janot. Mme. Kahl\nafterwards declared that the name Janet was unknown to\nher.\nxMme. Kahl, very pleased with this success, tried to\nrepeat it, and in order to make sure that I should think\nof a name known to her, asked me to think of the name\nof a poet. In order to see whether Mme. Kahi's conscious\nratiocination would affect her supernormal faculties, I\nselected a poet with the same Christian name, Pierre\nRonsard. The medium correctly said P, hut then added\nPaul. I noticed, however, that Mme. Kahi's manner in\nsaying this was a Mttle seK-conscious, and, on being-\nquestioned, she admitted that, having got the impression\nof P, she had added Paul because I had previously given\nPierre. I now wrote the full name and showed it to M.\nWarcollier wMle Mme. Kahl was out of the room. When\nthe latter returned she wrote automatically, in Russian\nscript, Rou, and said Rouson, but was unable to obtain\nmore. She afterwards said that she had never heard of\nRonsard. M. WarcoUier tells me that this would be quite\nhkely, even in a Frenchwoman.\nThis experiment was once more repeated, and, Mme.\n2e\n\f426 Theodore Besterman [part\nKahl having repeatedly declared that the more familiar a\nname is to her the more easily she can perceive it when\nit is thought of, I determined to think of a Russian\nwriter, and chose Nicholas Gogol. Mme. Kahl, with almost\nalarming promptitude, and very happily, exclaimed : \"It\nis a Russian name ! Nicholas !\n\" I now told Mme. Kahl\nthat she was right and that it was a Russian writer I had\nthought of. No sooner had I said this than M. Warcollier\nwrote in his notes, and passed to me, the name Gogol\n;\nand every person to whom I have put this problem since\nhas at once suggested Gogol as the missing part of the\nname. Nevertheless, Mme. Kahl, a Russian, to whom,\nas she afterwards agreed, the name Nicholas Gogol is\nextremely famihar, wholly failed in her attempts to supply\nthe missing name. She repeatedly scrawled words or names\nbeginning with C, but was unable to get anything nearer.\nThis incident appears to me a strong argument in favour\nof Mme. Kahl's honesty.\nI drew a figure, which, it was hoped, would appear on\nMme. Kahl's arm ; the experiment failed.\nI now drew this figure :\nFig. 7.\nMme. Kahl automatically drew on a piece of paper :\nFig. 8.\nThough these two figures are undoubtedly of the same\ngeneral type, the hkeness is not close enough, in my\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 427\nopinion, to justify the experiment being put down as a\nsuccess.\nMme. Kahl requested me to write a name, for the\npurpose of trjdng to make it appear on her arm. I\nthought of Frangois, but, deciding that this would be too\ndifficult, wrote Jean. The experiment failed so far as the\ndermographic intention was concerned, but Mme. Kahl\nrepeatedly said that she had the impression of F, and\nsuggested Fernand. Though I several times insisted that\nthe name I had written did not begin with F, Mme.\nKahl persisted in declaring that she was strongly impressed\nwith this letter. This seems an interesting case of thought-\ntransference ; it might have been more interesting still if\nI had encouraged Mme. Kahl to proceed with the F,\ninstead of declaring it to be wrong.\nM. Warcolher now attempted a dermographic experiment\nand drew what he thought of as the infinity sign :\nM. Warcolher drew this on a small scrap of paper, and,\nwithout showing it to anyone, folded it and kept it in his\nhand. There now appeared on Mme. Kahl's arm, first, a\nsquare, and then this figure, about 5 inches by 2 inches\nin size :\nBefore being told whether this was correct or not Mme.\nKahl was asked to write down what she took this figure\nto be, and she drew a large 8. This figure appeared on\nthe inner side of Mme. Kahl's left arm, and for this reason\nwas particularly interesting ; for before its appearance, it\nFIQ. 9.\nFIO. 10.\nSize reduced.\n\f428 Theodore Besterman [part\nhaving been, in my opinion, as impossible for Mme. Kahl\nas it had been for me to see M. Warcolher's drawing, I\nwas asked by her on which arm I should prefer the figure\nto appear. I first took hold of Mme. Kahl's wrists and\nthen chose the left arm, and here, without any contact\nwhatever, the figure duly appeared, the square having\npreviously (but while I was holding Mme. Kahl's wrists)\nappeared on the right arm, and quickly disappeared. This\n8 persisted rather longer than these appearances had done\npreviously, and I took advantage of the opportunity to\nexamine it as closely as was possible in the circum-\nstances. The figure, so far as I could judge with the\nnaked eye, gave the impression of being formed by a\nsuifusion or extravasation of blood below the sldn. It was\nnot in any way affected by the application of moisture.\nAfter the 8 had disappeared, each of us made a drawing\non one piece of paper : Mme. Kahl of an X, M. Warcolher\nof two interlaced circles, and I of two interlaced triangles.\nIn the same place where the 8 had recently disappeared\nthere was now gradually to be seen, for a few moments,\nand again without any kind of contact, a single triangle.\nMme. Kahl now took her glass of water and, putting two\nrings into it, tried to see my wife. She said that she\nwould not attempt to get her name, as, although she\ncould not remember it, she did remember having given it\non a previous occasion. This experiment failed. I was\nrequested to write the maiden name of my wife, Birley,\nwhich I did ; but Mme. Kahl was unable to \" get \" it.\nMme. Kahl said that the experiment of the 8 had tired\nher, but she would go on for a little while. I picked from\nthe pack the question: \"Me marierais-je ?\n\" [Will I\nmarry ?]. Mme. Kahl promptly said that my question was\nnot serious, that I was already married, but only at a\nregistrar's [mairie]. This is correct.\nMme. Kahl asked me to write two questions on a\npiece of paper, and left the room. I then wrote :\n\" Les\nparents de ma femme sont-ils vivants ?\n\" [Are the parents\nof my wife hving ?], and \" Que ferais-je dans six mois ?\n\"\n[What shall I be doing in six months ?]. I folded the\npaper into four. Mme. Kahl returned, picked up the\n\fIll] Fou7' Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 429\npaper at its open end with a pair of pincers, and burnt\nit. She then said that one of the questions concerned a\nchild, and declared herself too tired to go on. She was\nwilHng, however, to try one more experiment if she could\nhave the assistance of her husband. To this I agreed.\nMme. Kahl now left the room, to telephone to her\nhusband, whom we had left in the lounge of the hotel,\nfive floors below ; in her absence M. WarcolUer wrote with\nhis own pencil, and showed to me, the question :\n\" L'af-\nfaire du pontife reussira-t-elle ?\n\" [Will the business of the\npontiff succeed ?]. M. Warcolher did not explain the\nquestion, which conveyed no meaning to me. Mme. Kahl\nnow returned and, in the same way as before, burned the\npaper. It seems to have been impossible for Mme. Kahl to\nhave obtained knowledge of the contents of the paper\nwritten by M. WarcolUer ; while it was being written, and,\nindeed, during the whole time that she was out of the\nroom, Mme. Kahl was continuously in my sight telephoning\nin the passage just outside the open door of the room ;\nand experiments made since, one of them with Miss\nNewton, have failed to reveal any way in which the piece\nof paper might have been read while it was being picked\nup, or during the process of being burnt. M. Kahl did not\nenter the flat until after the paper was burnt.\nWhile awaiting the arrival of M. Kahl, the medium tried\nto discover whether I had any sisters, but failed to get\nany impressions. On M. Kahl's entry he put Mme. Kahl\ninto a very light liypnoidal condition and then suggested\nto her that she should now see clearly, that she should\nsee what had been written, that she should tell us what\nshe saw, and the like. Mme. Kahl now said that it was\na business question, but that she could not understand\nit ; it seemed to be \" pour cure, pour grand cure, pretre\nimportant \" [for cure, for big cure, important priest]. Then,\nagain exclaiming impatiently that she could not understand\nher impressions, Mme. Kahl returned to her normal state\nof consciousness. M. Warcollier explained that the ques-\ntion referred to a business transaction in which he was\nengaged with a gentleman whose address is at Pontifex\nHouse, London. M. Warcolher subsequently gave me the\n\f430 Theodore Besterman [part\nname and full particulars of this gentleman. This was\ntherefore a most interesting success, Mme. Kahl having\ncorrectly perceived, not the idea which M. WarcoUier wanted\nto convey but the literal meaning of what he had written,\nthough this meaning, of course, was also present in his\nmind.\nMme. Kahl now proposed to make the attempt of\nobtaining this gentleman's Christian name, and requested\nM. Warcollier to write it on a small piece of paper. This\nhe did, showing it to nobody, and, folding it in four,\nhanded it to Mme. Kahl below an opaque cloth. Mme.\nKahl then dictated, one after the other, the letters M, A,\nand U, being told after each one that it was correct (the\nname being Maurice). The paper, all this time under the\ncloth, was now returned to M. Warcollier, and Mme Kahl\nwrote automatically what may be read as Morus or Morris,\nthus :\nFig. 11.\nWe get here, as in the Genriette incident, an interesting\ninterplay of consciousness and subconsciousness In the\nGenriette case, Mme. Kahl, consciously knowing G to be\ncorrect, and then presumably receiving the impression of\nHenriette, consciously or unconsciously added the two\ntogether. In the present instance, although Mme Kahl\nconsciously knew Mau to be right (since she had been told\nso), yet, the automatic writing, being a direct expression\nof the sxibconsciousness, which had no doubt been influ-\nenced by the knowledge that the person concerned was an\nEnglishman, transmuted the Maurice into what a foreigner\nmight regard as an English or pseudo-English form of this\nname. This concluded the sitting.\nThe many interesting aspects of this sitting are even\nmore difficult than the previous cases to reduce to a\nstatistical basis. But even from this point of view the\nsuccesses obtained by Mme. Kahl will be seen to be very\n\fIll] Foiir Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 43\n1\nremarkable. Taking into account once more only those\ncases where the ideas transmitted had no physical\nexistence, we have several striking incidents. First comes\nthe Janot-Janet case ; this comprises the divination of\nPierre (we cannot count the P itself), the emphatic and\naccurate writing of J, although the card with I had been\nchosen, and the actual writing of Janot for Janet. We\nhave seen that, given the P, a correct guess of Pierre\nshould not be given a value of more than 2 to 1. The next\nincident, even if account be taken of the fact that Mme.\nKahl probably knew that there was no J in the pack,^\nought probably to be given a similar value : let us say\n3 to 1 for these two minor successes together. But the\nJanot for Janet is much more difficult to assess. We have\nto assume, against Mme. KahFs own statement, that the\nname of M. Janet is known to her, and we have also to\nassume, following the method of our present calculations,\nthat she had some means of knowing that I had chosen\nthe I card. Given this knowledge on Mme. Kahl's part,\nand also her knowledge that I was sitting with her on\nbehalf of the S.P.R., and assuming further that she is\nfamiliar with the fact that M. Janet had been closely\nconnected with the Society in earlier days (being still,\nindeed, a Corresponding Member of it), what are the\nchances against Mme. Kahl guessing the name of Pierre\nJanot ? It must be remembered that the information\npossessed by Mme. Kahl concerning the actual name was\nthe Christian name Pierre, and the information assumed to\nbe possessed by her is the initial I of the name and\nthe knowledge that there is no J in the pack. It should\nalso be borne in mind that this was the only occasion on\nwhich either M. Warcollier or I set Mme. Kahl a name in\nany way connected with psychical research, and also the\nonly occasion on which she put forward such a name.\nClearly, statistics have very little foothold here, but I think\nit will be granted that an estimate of 25 to 1 against this\n^ It is just possible that Mme. Kahl may have noticed my failure to\nfind the J ; but this is unhkely, for I had made a practice of always\ngoing through the pack two or three times before picking the card\nI wanted.\n\f432 Theodore Besterman [part\nsuccess being due to chance errs on the side of under-\nstatement.\nThe correct P of Pierre Ronsard may, as before, be\nassessed at 20 to 1. In the case of the divination of\nNicholas, we are again in more difficult regions. Here the\nonly indication possessed by Mme. Kahl was that I was\nthinldng of a Christian name. The chances against the\ncorrect selection of Nicholas from the whole range of\nChristian names, male and female, and, at any rate,\nFrench and Enghsli, would be substantially undervalued\nat 200 to 1. Then we will estimtite, once more, at 20 to\n1 the correct F of Frangois. And, finally, we have the\ninteresting statement that I was married only at a mairie.\nFailing reliable information as to the number of people\nwho go through the civil ceremony only, the value of this\nsuccess can only be guessed at. A humble 2 to 1 would\ncertainly be no exaggeration. We thus obtain a total\nminimum probability of 1,200,000 to 1 against the successes\nobtained at this sitting being due to chance, again ex-\ncluding some of the most striking results.^\nOn the conclusion of this sitting Mme. Kahl was again\nasked whether she would not submit to stricter conditions,\nbut she did not care to do so, and herseK suggested\nthat it seemed useless to continue the sittings. This was\ntrue enough, for I had now seen all the phenomena\nMme. Kahl readily produces, and, faihng better conditions,\nwith opportunities for control and for initiating new\ntests and experiments, further sittings would have been\nmerely repetitions of those already described. In these\ncircumstances the series was discontinued for the time\nbeing.\nIt is hoped that the 8.P.R. will further investigate this\nmost interesting medium, and I therefore abstain, for the\npresent, from any closer discussion of the case ; but I\ncannot conclude without thanking M. and Mme. Kahl for\nhaving so amiably borne with what, I fear, must some-\ntimes have seemed to them my discourteous persistence.\nI am also indebted to M. Warcollier for attending the\n^ I make no attemjjt to assess the statistical value of the series as a\nwhole.\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 433\nsittings and for taking full and accurate notes, and to\nMme. Warcollier for her kind hospitality.\nII. MME. BRIFFAUT : PARIS.\nAt the time of my first sittings with Mme. Kahl I asked\nto be given the names of the best clairvoyants in Paris.\nFirst on the fist suppHed to me by a well-known student\nof psychical research appeared the name of Mme. Briffaut,\nand remembering the very eulogistic terms in which\nProfessor Richet speaks of this lady\/ I called on her\nby appointment in company with the same gentleman\nwith whom I first sat with Mme. Kahl. It was this\ngentleman who was the sitter, I merely acting as\ninterpreter.\nMme. Brifi^aut does not go into trance, and explains that\nshe sees apparitions of dead persons round the sitter. On\nthis occasion the medium described several such figures,\nnone of which was recognised by the sitter. Mme. Brilfaut\nalso mentioned a considerable number of names, only a\nfew of the most common of which, such as Mary and John,\nhad any significance for the sitter. The medium asked\nmany questions, and followed up such as were answered,\nbut always quite unsuccessfully. The sitting was then\ngiven up.\nIII. RUDI SCHNEIDER: MUNICH.\nDuring my stay in Munich, and after the departure of\nthe S.P.R. Committee which had had sittings with Willi\nand Rudi Schneider, Baron von Schrenck-Notzing very\nkindly invited me to participate in two further sittings\nwith the latter. These sittings were completely negative,\nso that httle useful purpose would be served by describing\nthem. Baron von Schrenck-Notzing also allowed me to\nattend what might be called an informal preparatory\n^ Charles Richet, Notre sixieme sens (Paris [1927]), pp. 137-141 ; cp.\nCarita Borderieux, \" Madame Briffaut,\" Psychica (Paris 1928), viii. 8-10.\n\f434 Theodore Besterman [part\nsitting with Rudi at which only the Baron and I were\npresent. Rudi quickly passed into his trance-hke condition\nand the Baron then had a most friendly conversation\nwith Rudi's control, Olga, during which the latter ex-\npressed herself satisfied with the conditions of the\nsittings and with myself as a sitter, and promised to\nproduce phenomena that evening. This promise was\nunfortimately not fulfilled.\nThe accompanying diagram (Fig. 12) illustrates the new\nsystem of control, designed by the late Karl Krall, recently\ninstalled by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing in his laboratory\nand already described by Dr. WooUey.^ Baron von\nSchrenck-Notzing kindly allowed me to examine the fittings,\nand I was able to trace the wires for their whole length\nto and from the accumulators. The whole system is\nunquestionably within the room, distinct from any other\nelectrical installation, and it does not seem possible for\nit to be interfered with from outside.\nI should hke to thank Baron von Schrenck-Notzing very\nwarmly for giving me these various facihties and for his\ni^indness and hospitality to me during my stay in Munich.^\nIV. MARIA SILBERT : GRAZ.\nI arrived in Graz from Munich on the evening of Thurs-\nday, the 1st of November 1928, and, notwithstanding the\nlate hour, immediately called on Professor Walter. I had\npreviously hoped to visit Graz in the middle of October,\nwith Studienrat Dr. Lambert, of Stuttgart, and Dr.\nTischner, of Munich. But owing to Frau Silbert's illness\nthis visit had to be cancelled.

I was unwilling,\nhowever, to pay a visit with such slender possibilities, and\naccordingly asked Dr. Tischner, who had expressed a desire\nto accompany me on my postponed visit, to write himself\nand to try and arrange definite sittings. I had made all\narrangements to leave Munich on the 31st of October, and,\nno answer having been received by then,^ I determined to\ntake the risk of proceeding to Graz alone and unheralded.\nIt was in these circumstances that I called on Pro-\nfessor Walter.\nHe received me in the friendliest possible way, and\nexplained the position to me. As I had suspected, the\ndifficulty in arranging sittings was due only in part to the\nmedium's state of health. The chief cause was Dr. W. F.\nPrince's report of his sittings in Europe, in which he\ncame to an adverse conclusion regarding Frau Silbert's\nmediumship.2 Professor Walter promised, notwithstanding\nFrau Silbert's alleged unwilhngness to give further sittings\nto Enghsh-speaking investigators, to do what he could to\nobtain some for me ;\nand, in fact, until the end of iny visit,\nhe made all possible efforts on my behalf.\nOn the morning of the 2nd of November 1928 Professor\nWalter and I called on Frau Silbert ; she was out, but on\npajdng another visit later in the morning we were able\nto have a talk with her. Professor Walter did his best\nto give Frau Silbert a favourable impression of me, and I\nexerted myself to the same end. Frau Silbert, without\nmaking difficulties of any kind, promised me sittings\n;\nbut, the previous day having been All Saints', she intended\nto visit her parents' graves, either that afternoon or the\nnext, and midertook to give me a sitting on whichever\n''\nI ought to explain that no possible blame attaches to Professor\nWalter for his delay in replying, this having been due to the fact that\nDr. Tischner, through a misunderstanding, had written to him of a\nproposed visit on the 4th of November.\n^ [W. F. Prince], Experiments with Physical Mediums in Europe\n(Boston Society for Psychic Research, Bulletin VII : Boston 1928),\npp. 70 et seq.\n\f436 Theodore Besterman [part\nevening remained free. This was to be decided by a\ntelephone call to me at my hotel. I accordingly said that\nI would leave my card and write the name of the hotel\non it. As I was about to do so, Professor Walter, know-\ning that my card bore, as my London address, that of\nthe S.P.R., and fearing that this might prejudice Frau\nSilbert against me, intervened to say that I had better\nwrite the necessary information on his card, which I did.\nThis incident, which scarcely occupied a second or two,\ndid not escape the notice of Frau Silbert, and the hitherto\ncordial atmosphere now cooled. During our call I several\ntimes heard raps, which seemed to be made on the wall\nbehind the medium, and on the table. I knocked three\ntimes in a particular rhythm, and this was reproduced.\nThe arranged telephone call did not arrive, and on the\nmorning of Saturday, the 3rd of November, at about\n11.15, I called again on Frau Silbert. The door was opened\nby her little grandson, who informed me, after inquiry,\nthat his grandmother was still in bed, but that I would\nbe telephoned later. I returned to the hotel to await this\ncall, which also never came. In the afternoon I called\non Professor Walter, explained the situation to him, and\nwe decided to go out again that evening. I suggested that\nthese difficulties might be due to the unfortunate impression\nmade on Frau Silbert by the visiting card incident, and\nthat something ought to be done to counteract it. Ac-\ncordingly, during our evening visit, when we were received\nby Frau Silbert's daughters, Ella, Paula and Mitzi (Marie),\nI succeeded in bringing the conversation rovmd to eccen-\ntric visiting-cards, and producing my own by way of\nillustration, left it on the table. Before we took our leave,\nFraulein Ella, the eldest and most influential of Frau\nSilbert's children, definitely promised, on behaK of her\nmother, a sitting for Monday evening at Professor Walter's\nflat. We were told that it was impossible to have one\nsooner owing to the medium's health ; on Monday it\ntranspired that Dr. Maner had had a sitting on Sunday\nevening. The suggestion that the sitting should take place\nat his home came from Professor Walter liimself, I having\nfeared to make such a proposal. The final details were to\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 437\nbe settled on Monday morning, by telephone, between\nFraulein Ella and Professor Walter. During Monday\nmorning accordingly. Professor Walter telephoned me to\nsay that the sitting was fixed for about 8.30 that evening,\nbut that the Silberts had asked that it should take place\nin their own home, and that Dr. Auer should also be\npresent. To both these changes I readily agreed.\nOn arrival at the Silberts' flat at the appointed time,\nwe were informed that, in addition to Dr. Auer, a Dr.\nManer was also to be present. When the latter arrived,\nhe brought an uninvited friend, a Dr. Wunsch, with him.^\nAt 9 o'clock the sitting began, but before proceeding to\nan account of it, it will be as well to give a sketch and\na brief description of such features of Frau Silbert's\nsitting-room, which is that used for her mediumistic\npurposes, as are relevant to what follows. Frau Silbert\nalways sat at A, and thus had the large window at her\nDOOR\no\no\no\nJi\n,\nDOOR ^\nFIG. 13.\nThis sketch is not to scale.\nright, the door leading to the entrance hall facing her,\nthe door leading into a large bedroom at her left, and\n1 1 could not help wondering what would have been said if I had\nventured to introduce a stranger in this way !\n\f438 Theodore Besterman [part\nanother door (that of a cupboard, I beUeve) behind her\nand to her left. The distance from position A to the wall\nbehind it, ignoring an intervening sideboard, is approxi-\nmately 6 feet ; and this distance will show, with suffi-\ncient accuracy for our present purpose, the general\nmeasurements represented on the sketch, which does not\npretend to be exactly to scale.\nAt the present sitting, then, the sitters were disposed\nround the table (with reference to Fig. 13) as follows :\nFrau Silbert at A, Professor Walter at B, Dr. Auer at C,\nmyself at D, Dr. Wunsch at E, and Dr. Maner at F.\nImmediately, I felt a touch on the left knee, and heard\nraps ; these two classes of phenomena occurred throughout\nthe sitting, which lasted about 3| hours. As nothing\noccurred which would make a purely chronological record\nvaluable, and in view of the method of observation about\nto be described, I will discuss separately the raps, the\ntouches, and the other phenomena. I will begin with the\nraps.\nThe table in Frau Silbert's room (as shown in Fig. 13)\nhas a flat wooden cross-piece, about 3 inches from the\nfloor, connecting the four legs. Immediately on taking\nmy place I pressed my feet tightly beneath the central part\nof this cross, thus controlhng, from my position, the whole\nof this junction of the four radiating spokes. Each time\nraps seemed to come from the table, I felt on my feet\nthat pressure had been exerted on the cross-piece. This\npressure was not synchronous with each rap, as \"would\nreasonably be expected were the sounds produced by an\noutside force coming into contact with the table, thus\nproducing the rap, and then withdrawing before making\nthe next contact and rap. On the contrary, the pressure\npersisted throughout each series of table-raps, and ceased\nat their completion. This suggested the possibility that\nthe table-raps were produced with the toes, the sound\nof these raps, as if made on wood, being produced by\nplacing the foot or feet on the wooden cross-piece. ^ And\nthis hypothesis of course bore as a corollary the further\n1 I can vouch for the possibility of this as I have succeeded in repro-\nducing these raps myself in the manner suggested.\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation^ 439\npossibility that other types of raps might be produced by\nplacing the foot in other positions.\nThis theory, clearly, could only be tested by the most\ncareful observation. I therefore determined to devote a\ncontinuous period of time exclusively to the raps, and from\n9.15 to 10.30,1 I carefully noted everything that appeared\nto have some bearing on them. Unfortunately, I was\nunable to continue observation of the phenomenon\u2014the\npressure on the cross-piece\u2014on which this decision rested,\nfor soon after the beginning of the sitting the table rapped\nout instructions to the sitters to change their places. For\nthe rest of the evening we sat as follows : Frau Silbert,\nas always, at A, Dr. Wiuisch at B, Dr. Auer at G,\nProfessor Walter at D, myself at E, and Dr. Maner at F.\nFrom this position I was no longer able to control the\nwhole of the central cross, but only one of the narrower\nsides ; and although I placed my feet under it as before,\nI no longer felt confident that I could correctly interpret\nthe various pressures I felt from time to time.\nFrom another point of view, however, the change in my\nposition was most advantageous. For my new line of\nsight enabled me to obtain a better view of Frau\nSilbert's body, and I soon noticed that the medium, as is\nof course perfectly natural, sometimes sat with her feet\nunder her chair, sometimes with her feet in front of the\nchair in an ordinary seated position, sometimes with her\nlegs stretched out before her, and with the appropriate\nvariations, as, for instance, one leg stretched out and one\nunder the chair. Careful observation soon showed that it\nwas possible to see quite clearly whenever the position of\nthe legs was changed. However quietly the change was\nmade, it involved slight movements of the hips, and, to\n1 The times given throughout this report are only approximate. I\nwitnessed no phenomena in which exactitude as to the time of their\nappearance seems to be of much imjjortance, though I saw many the\nsequence of which is vitally important. That is, it is of little use to\nknow that the medium X made a given movement of the foot at 4.33\nand that at 4.331 one of the sitters felt a touch. It is enough to record\nthe sequence, namely, that the movement was immediately followed by\na touch. And the constant examination of a watch, often in very poor\nlight, is a dangerous distraction of the attention.\n\f440 Theodore Besterman [part\na less degree, of the upper part of the body ; in fact, the\nmore quietly the feet were moved, the more noticeable\nbecame the bodily movements. For a silent change in\nposition of the feet, involving, as it does, not merely a\nshding backwards or forwards, but also a raising of them\nfrom the floor, naturally involves greater muscular effort\nthan does a careless movement. In view of my notion\nthat Frau Silbert's feet might be on the cross-piece when\nraps were heard from the table, this possibility of knowing\nwhere the feet were placed at any given moment was of\nthe greatest value.\nI now noted the changes in position of the medium's\nfeet in connection with the direction from which the raps\nseemed to come, and observed that the situation of her\nlegs always ^ corresponded with the apparent source of\nthe raps. That is, whenever Frau Silbert's legs were\nunder the table, the raps seemed to come from the\ntable, whenever her legs were in front of the chair, the\nraps seemed to come from the chair, and whenever her\nlegs were under the chair, the raps seemed to come from\nthe chair or from the wall behind the medium. I heard\nraps from no other source, although Frau Silbert and the\nother sitters frequently pointed to the ceihng, to the other\nwalls, and to various objects, as sources of raps. I have\nvery little doubt that , so far, at any rate, as the sitters\nwere concerned, this was simply auto- or hetero-suggestion.\nFurther, series of double raps, sometimes of considerable\nloudness and rapidity, were several times heard on the\ntable : but only when both Frau Silbert's legs were under\nthe table. And a further series of raps was heard, which\nseemed to come alternately from the wall and the table,\nand from the chair and the table : but never when both\nFrau Silbert's legs were under the table or under the\nchair. It is noteworthy that these raps never alternated\nbetween the wall and the chair, perhaps because the\ndifference in the quahty of the sounds is not sufficient to\n1 Or, to be perfectly accurate, with a single exception out of a series\nof 18 to 20 observations, at the first sitting. On this single occasion\nraps came from the table when I thought that both Frau Silbert's feet\nwere under the chair.\n\fIll] Four Months'' Tour of Psychical Investigation 441\nmake the phenomenon effective. Again, although I some-\ntimes heard raps at the same moment as I felt a touch,\nat no time did I feel a touch during one of the series of\ndouble or alternating raps. Finally, throughout this time\nI repeatedly rapped on the table in various tempi and\nrhythms ; when these raps were made openly they were\nnearly always reproduced ; but when done privily, or\nwithout first drawing Frau Silbert's attention to them, they\nwere never reproduced.\nAt this point, rightly or wrongly, no doubt remained in\nmy mind that the raps were produced by Frau Silbert's\nfeet ; and for approximately the following hour I con-\ncentrated my attention on the touches and on the\nkindred phenomena. These consisted, strictly, of two\nkinds : (a) hght touches, pressure, and even blows, and\n(6) pulls of the trouser-legs ; but with these phenomena\nmay be conveniently classed movements of objects\nperformed, and engravings of objects placed, under or in\nthe immediate neighbourhood of the table. We have\nalready made the crucial observation that no touches and\nthe hke were felt when double or alternate raps were\nbeing produced. The decision to concentrate observation\non the touches was made in the following circumstances.\nAt 10.5 Frau Silbert said that she would try to get her\ncontrolling spirit. Dr. Nell, to perform once more the now\nfamous feat of engraving his name on articles placed on\nthe cross-bar below the table. She asked Dr. Auer to go\ninto the bedroom and bring a certain small medaUion and\nchain. While he was out of the room and the sitters were\nanimatedly discussing what they hoped they were about to\nexperience, Frau Silbert leaned back and placed her feet\nwith considerable pressure on the cross-bar. At a given\nmoment this pressure was relaxed and immediately after\nI felt a blow on the right knee. At 10.15 the medalhon\nand chain was placed on the cross-bar, and Frau Silbert,\nreferring to the allegations brought against her in\nconnection with her alleged prepared shoes, stockings, and\nso on, rose and tried to take off her shoes. ^ She declared,\n^ These were bar-shoes, that is, with a single strap buttoning across\nthe arch.\n2f\n\f442 Theodore Besterman [part\nhowever, that they were too tight to get off herself, and\nher daughter Mitzi, who had entered from the bedroom at\nthe same time as Dr. Auer returned, had to remove them\nfor her. Frau Silbert showed that her stockings and shoes\nwere quite normal, and then put the latter on again,\nstamping on each shoe to get it on.^ After a little time,\nthe light having in the meanwhile been turned down,\nthough by no means quite out, Frau Silbert flung her hand\nabove her head and, opening her clenched fist, produced\nthe medalhon and chain, the former bearing a roughly\nscratched N. I now put my watch under the table, and\nduring the next half-hour the watch moved backwards and\nforwards, a distance of some four or five yards in all,\nsometimes on the cross-bar, and sometimes on the floor, but\nnever more than a foot or so away from the cross-bar.\nWhen the watch was eventually recovered it had on\nthe lower curve of the outer case a mass of small scratches\nand one long scratch right across the case. During this\nhalf-hour I saw the watch twelve to fifteen times, but\nnever in movement ; other sitters, however, declared\nfrom time to time that they saw the watch move\nwithout contact.\nAt about 11.15 I felt on my left knee a touch which\ngave most vividly the impression of being made by a foot ;\nthat is, I had the impression of being in contact with the\nball and heel of a small stockinged foot. I moved my\nknee forward, and now came into additional contact with\na third object between the previous two, which gave the\nimpression as of the inner side of the arch of a foot,\nand which then withdrew. A moment later Frau Silbert\nasked the sitters to look under the table. They all did\nso in a perfunctory manner, and everything seemed to be\nin order ;\nimmediately after we had all looked up again,\nI glanced under the table once more and now saw Frau\nSilbert's feet out of her shoes and sufficiently far above\nthem to enable me to see the floor between the feet and\n1 In view of what follows in this connection I may add tliat I sub-\nsequently questioned Professor Walter and Dr. Auer on this j^oint,\nindependently of course. Both were quite certain that Frau Silbert had\nput her shoes on again, the latter having even seen her do so.\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 443\nthe shoes. During these last happenings the Mght above\nthe table was very dim, and beneath the table it was\nconsequently quite dark ; had Frau Silbert's feet at that\nmoment been an inch or two nearer the floor, so as to\nmake it impossible, from the line of sight of one bending\ndown and looking under the table, to see between her feet\nand the shoes, it would have been impossible to know\nwhether her feet were in or out of the shoes.\nIn the above two series of special observations all\nrelevant phenomena have been brought together, but of\ncourse there took place at intervals other phenomena, and\nthese I must now describe. From time to time throughout\nthe sitting, various messages were rapped through the\ntable ; of these I need only mention the two referring to\nme personally. The one requested Professor Walter to\nproceed rapidly with the book he is writing about Frau\nSilbert's mediumship, that German and English editions\nshould be arranged to appear simultaneously, and that I\nshould undertake the English translation. The other came\na few minutes after I had observed Frau Silbert's feet out\nof her shoes ; it ran thus :\n\" Niemals werden Doctoren\ngeistige sphaeren degradieren \" [Doctors will never degrade\nspiritual spheres]. As I am the only one of the five sitters\nwho is not a doctor, we naturally took tliis to apply to me,\nand, on inquiry, the table confirmed this supposition. It should,\nperhaps, be also recorded that during the sitting Ottokar\nKernstock, a poet very popular in the Steiermark, who had\ndied some hours before the sitting, announced himself\nthrough the intermediary of the table, and gave the name\nof one of his lesser-known poems. But it is quite hkely\nthat news of the poet's death had reached Frau Silbert,\nfor it was known to two or three of the sitters, and even\nto myseK ; in any case, Frau Silbert admittedly knew of\nthe poet's serious illness.\nAt about 9.30 and again at about 9.45 a brilliant fiash,\naccompanied by a faint hissing sound, was seen in the\ncorner of the room to Frau Silbert's left. I am prepared\nto vouch for the fact that neither of these fiashes was\nproduced by Frau Silbert's hands, which were on the table\nthroughout these periods and, indeed, throughout most of\n\f444 Theodore Besterman [part\nthe sitting ; but as they occurred at a point only a few\ninches from the door of the room in which were Mitzi\nand Paula, it would be wrong to attach too much\nimportance to it. At the same time, these flashes were\nthe most interesting phenomena I observed in connection\nwith Frau Silbert, and I am bound to add that if they\nwere fraudulently produced I am unable, failing inquiry\nand experiment, to say how. Unfortunately, these flashes\nwere in each case of very brief duration, and, unlike\nmost of the other phenomena, totally unexpected. Careful\nobservation was therefore impossible.\nAt about 10.20 and again at 12.0, in complete darkness,\none of the sitters, the same in each case, reported phan-\ntasms. On the second occasion Frau Silbert had apparently\nfallen into a trance accompanied by stertorous breathing,\ngasping, and the Uke. The above-mentioned sitter, badly\ndisturbed by Frau Silbert's abnormal behaviour and by\nthe darkness, exclaimed hysterically, and in rapid succession,\nthat he saw lights, three phantasms, felt first the touch of\na hand, and then of a child's hand, and so on. No other\nsitter saw anything, except that one of them, when directly\nappealed to by his friend, said \" Ja, ja,\" and that I saw\na vague shape on Dr. Wunsch's arm (at B), the nature\nof which I was unable to determine owing to the distance\nand the darkness.\nDuring the latter part of the sitting Dr. Auer described\nthe apparently supernormal movements, often observed by\nother sitters, of the drawer of the table, which opened\ntowards Frau Silbert, at A, and therefore away from Dr.\nAuer, at C. He put his hand under the table in order\nto imitate for my benefit the kind of movements seen,\nand at this moment the drawer shot out, to Dr. Auer's\ngreat embarrassment. The drawer, though urgently pressed\nto do so, refused to close itself, and at last had to be\npushed back by Frau Silbert. This was the only time the\ndrawer moved in my presence.\nFinally, brief reference must be made to certain incidents\nthat are not precisely \" phenomena \" (rather the contrary,\nindeed), but which are equally instructive. There were\nthree occasions during the sitting on which I accidentally\n\fIll] Foiir Months'' Tour of Psychical Investigation 445\ntouched, or was touched by, the foot of the sitter on my\nright or on my left, and on which the sitter so touched\nasked the other whether that was his foot he had just\nfelt. On each of these occasions, before the person\nquestioned had time to reply, ^ Frau Silbert said \" Yes,\nyes, that was no phenomenon.\" It must be noted in this\nconnection that when seemingly supernormal touches were\nreported in the ordinary course, Frau Silbert declared\nignorance of them, and was as pleased as the sitters\nconcerned. Now, Frau Silbert must necessarily be ignorant\nof any accidental contact that maj^ occur between two\nsitters ;\nand, being Hkewise ignorant of the occurrence of\nsupernormal touches, one is bound to ask how she dis-\ntinguishes between them. The sitting concluded at 12.20.\nDuring discussions with Professor Walter, Dr. Auer, and\na number of other gentlemen to whom sittings with Frau\nSilbert are almost everyday occurrences, I was repeatedly\ntold that Frau Silbert produces the best phenomena when\nher mind is distracted, and her imagination and emotions\nare in play. I therefore considered, without coming to any\nquite satisfactory conclusion, how these conditions could\nbest be produced ; but when I was later told that Frau\nSilbert often went to the cinema, and that supernormal\nphenomena had frequently been observed in her presence\nat theatres and cinemas, it seemed to me that the solution\nof my problem had been found. During the afternoon of\nThursday, the 8th of November, I called on Frau Silbert,\nfinding Dr. Auer already there. We conversed nearly two\nhours, during the first few minutes of which the table\nmade one or two small movements ;\nraps were heard at\nintervals throughout. To my great satisfaction, Frau\nSilbert then excused herself, as she was going to the\ncinema ; I begged to be allowed to accompany her,\nand, from a dark private box, we witnessed a most\n^ It is only fair, however, to add that on the third occasion, having\nbecome rather suspicious of these replies of Frau Silbert's, I set her a\nlittle trap, though not, I hope, an unfair one. On being asked by Dr.\nManer whether I had touched his foot (which I had), I paused as if\ndoubtful and glanced questioningly at Frau Silbert, who promptly made\nthe usual reply.\n\f446 '\n'\nTheodore Besterman [part\nmelodramatic film, in which Frau Silbert was completely\nabsorbed. Here, then, were the ideal conditions : privacy,\ndarkness, quiet, absence of all suggestion of a sitting or\nof experimental conditions, the medium's mind far from\nthoughts of the supernormal, and her emotional and\nimaginative life aroused. But, to my disappointment, not\na single phenomenon of any kind occurred. Before we\nparted a special sitting was arranged for the following day,\nat which only Dr. Auer and myseH were to be present.\nThe sitting duly took place at Frau Silbert 's, at 4\no'clock, with Dr. Auer, Herr Kock, and myself as sitters.\nFrau Silbert pointed out that she was wearing soft shppers\nand rose to change them to shoes. I begged her not to do\nso, in order to ascertain whether the shppers would make\nany difi^erence in the quality of the raps ; but I was unable\nto come to any definite conclusion on this point : the\nraps were as numerous as at the previous sitting, and,\nalthough there were no double and alternate raps, there\nwere a few which seemed quite as loud as before. At\nabout 4.45 I felt the same touch as at the previous sitting,\nof an object like the ball and heel of a foot ; I again\npushed my knee forward and again felt what seemed to\nme the complete impress of a foot. As the object with-\ndrew Frau Silbert's chair creaked. A few minutes later\nthe medium changed her chair for one that did not creak.\nDuring the sitting, which lasted a Mttle over three hours,\nraps and touches occurred intermittently, but I was unable\nto observe anything new, merely confirming, so far as\npossible, my previous observations.\nAn interesting development took place in connection\nwith the messages rapped through the table. I had given\nan account of the apparently telepathic and clairvoyant\nphenomena I had recently observed in Paris with Mme.\nKahl-Toukholka (whom I did not name), and this seemed\nto arouse a sense of rivalry in Frau Silbert. For about\nan hour after, the table rapped a series of messages\nconnected with my Paris experiences. Their substance\nwas that I was not to separate the Paris phenomena from\nthose I was observing with Frau Silbert, that I was to\nadopt a critical attitude in Paris, and that Frau Silbert's\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 447\nsupernormal mental powers were only partially dead. I\nsaid that I could not quite understand the instruction\nabout adopting a critical attitude, and asked the table\nwhether I was to understand that the Paris phenomena\nwere not genuine ; Frau Silbert shook her head, and then\nthe table rephed in the negative. Finally, at 5.35, came\nthe message :\n\" Sage dort ein Wort das sie hier zeichnen\nwird \" [Say there a word which she will draw here]. This\nwas interpreted (and the supposition was confirmed by the\ntable) as a proposed cross-correspondence to be attempted by\nme between Frau Silbert and Mme. Kahl-Toukliolka. I very\nmuch regret, however, that Professor Walter and Dr. Auer\nrefuse to inform me whether Frau Silbert performed her\npart of this test. They take up this attitude on the\nquite mistaken ground that, having come to an adverse\nconclusion as to the physical j)henomena of Frau Silbert's\nmediumship, I cannot be sincerely interested in the\nsuccess of this mental experiment.\nDuring this long series of rapped messages, it sometimes\noccurred (seven times in all) ^ that mistakes were made in\ncounting or interpreting the raps, so that a word or\nsentence could not be understood, and that none of the\nsuggestions of the sitters was approved by the table. In\neach of these cases the missing or incorrect parts were\nsupphed or corrected at Frau Silbert's initiative.\nThe following afternoon I called on Frau Silbert to say\ngood-bye, and we parted with the friendhest feelings,\nwhich, speaking for myself, iwere and are perfectly genuine.\nBefore I left Graz I thought it right to inform both Dr.\nAuer and Professor Walter of the observations I had made,\nbut asked them not to inform the medivim for the time\nbeing, so as not to spoil the possibility of carrying out the\nproposed cross-correspondence, and to this they agreed.\nAfter a review of my first sitting and my informal con-\nversations with Frau Silbert, I found it impossible to resist\nthe conclusion that the phenomena I had witnessed were\nfraudulently produced. I did not come to this conclusion\n^ This number is exclusive of the incident noted in the previous\nparagraph ; there were of course many more mistakes which were at\nonce corrected by one or other of the sitters.\n\f448 Theodore Besterman [PAKT\nwillingly, nor without a good deal of internal struggle.\nFor Frau Silbert, who has a most sympathetic personality,\nhad made a decidedly good impression on me ; and one\ndoes not hke to put down as a fraud an elderly woman,\nthe mother and grandmother of a large family, a widow\nin poor circumstances who has never accepted payments\nfor her sittings, even in times of acute difficulty. If,\ntherefore, I had any leanings away from the strictest\nimpartiality when studying the notes of my sittings, it was\ndistinctly a leaning in Frau Silbert's favour. But, as I\nhave said, it was impossible to resist the facts ; never-\ntheless, though I felt bound to adopt the hypothesis of\nfraud, I still hoped that it might be possible to ascribe\nthe fraud to some aberrant impulse, unconsciously carried\nout. For instance, how, I reasoned, can one accuse of\nconscious fraud a woman, who, with tears in her eyes,\nand taking one's hand in hers, refers, in tones trembling\nwith indignation, to the accusations brought against her 1\nHow can one so suspect a woman who points to her\nwhite hairs, her ripeness for the grave, and speaks of the\nsole inheritance she wishes to leave her children, since she\nhas no wealth to give them, that of a white and\nspotless honour ? How can one so suspect a woman who\nalludes to the temptation of a medium who, at a critical\nmoment, confronted by an investigator, finds that his\nphenomena fail to appear, and fraudulently helps himself\nout of his difficulty : a thing that she could never under\nany circumstances do ?\nI put on record these specimens of Frau Silbert's con-\nversation, unusual though it may be to do so in a report\nof this nature, because I have found on inquiry that the\nsame type of emotional appeal is exercised on all the\ninvestigators who come to inquire into Frau Silbert's\nmediumship. And it is important to know this, for I\nmust frankly admit that the state of feeHngs thus pro-\nduced in me, as, no doubt, in other investigators similarly\ntreated, was one in which I was not able to disallow the\nmitigating theory of unconscious fraud until a further\nanalysis of the facts, and a further sitting, left me with\nso clear a conviction that I could no longer honestly reject\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 449\nit. To take a single instance, an instance of direct obser-\nvation and not of inference, can one reasonably describe as\nunconscious fraud the process of elaborately pretending, in\ncomplicity with a daughter, that a shoe is extremely tight,\nwhereas the shoe is of a style which, however tight, is\neasily removed, and which, in fact, was later so removed\nunder the table without the assistance even of the hands ?\nAnd this without going at all into the reasons for\nremoving the shoe in this way.\nIt may, however, be argued that if one rejects the\nhypothesis of unconscious fraud, and with it the existence\nof an abnormal state of mind in the medium, it becomes\ndifficult to understand the psychology of a person who\nmakes speeches such as those I have summarised, and at\nthe same time ^ conducts a flagrant fraud. This is not a\nreal difficulty : any lawyer experienced in the examination\nof interested witnesses will vouch for the possibiHty of such\nconduct in persons of perfectly normal mentahty, and there\nare few private individuals who are fortunate enough not\nto have had similar experiences in their own fives. But\nthen there arises, of course, the question of motive : this\nis a deficate subject, into which I do not propose to enter\nvery far. I will merely observe that financial advantages\nare not the only ones which require consideration.\nMy indebtedness to Professor Walter is clear from many\nreferences in the previous pages ; and I should also Hke\nto thank Frau Silbert and her daughters, particularly\nFraulein Mitzi, for the uniform kindness and hospitafity\nwith which they met me.\nV. F. A. RONDON-VERI: GRAZ.\nDuring my visit to Graz I had the opportunity of\nattending a meeting of the Grazer Parapsychologische\nGesellschaft. I had been told that a young painter, Herr\n^ This expression is to be taken in the most Hteral sense : it was\nactually during one of the speeches quoted that I felt one of the\npressures on my knee which seemed to me to have been made by Frau\nSilbert' s foot.\n\f450 Theodore Besterman [part\nF. A. Rondon-Veri, had recently developed remarkable\nmediumistic powers. The account I was given of the\nastonishing phenomena he had produced made me very\nanxious to meet him, and Dr. Wehsch, the President of\nthe Parapsychologische Gesellschaft, to whom I was\nintroduced by Professor Walter, very kindly gave me this\nopportunity of doing so. During the course of the evening\none of the members gave an address summarising the\nliterature about Theresa Neumann. During the part of the\nlecture that dealt with her stigmatisations Herr Rondon-\nVeri left the room for a few seconds and immediately after\nhis return complained of pains in his left palm. The palm\nbeing examined, it was found to bear on one of the lines\na shght wound, or rather, a subcutaneous congestion of\nthe blood, as if the skin had been rubbed with a blunt\ninstrument. This appearance, which was interpreted as an\nincipient stigmatisation, was the only phenomenon I was\nable to see in connection with this medium.\nVI. TIBOR MOLNAR AND LAJOS PAPP : BUDAPEST.\nVery promising reports had been received by the Society\nfrom Hungary concerning two physical mediums, who, it\nseemed, were being investigated in a most scientific manner.\nAnd the Society having been asked to investigate the\nphenomena of these mediums, the task of doing so was\ndelegated to me. During my stay in Budapest I had\nthe pleasure of being the guest of Mr. Karoly Rothy, one\nof the Society's two members in Hungary.\nI learned that these two mediums, Tibor Molnar, a\npainter, and Lajos Papp, a skilled turner, customarily sat\ntogether. But on my representations it was arranged that\nin the three sittings I had with these mediums the first\nshould be held as usual, the second with one of the\nmediums alone, and the third with the other medium\nalone.\nIt will be convenient to begin with a brief description of\nthe room in which the first two sittings took place. This\n\fPLATE I.\n\f\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 451\nground-floor room, the studio of Molnar, is about 30 feet\nsquare, with one corner cut off by means of a Ught partition\nwhich does not reach to the ceihng. The table (illustrated\nin figs. 14 and 15) used at the sittings has a kind of box,\ncontaining a slab of sculptors' clay fixed to its under surface,\nand closed with wire-netting which forms the central part\nof a thin piece of wood which, when in position, prevents\naccess to the whole under-surface of the table (see fig. 14).\n^\nThis table was placed a couple of yards from one of the\nwalls, near the position shown in fig. 16, except that in\nthe illustration the table is rather nearer the wall. The\nmedium ^ was given his place between the table and the\nwall, so that there was a distance of about a yard (exactly\nthe length of my outstretched arm) from the back of his\nchair to the wall. Behind the medium and to his left\nstood a light table on which was placed a box similar in\nappearance and contents to that under the experimental\ntable, but larger and of simpler construction (fig. 17). On\nthe wall behind the medium there hung several canvasses,\nmost of them tacked or nailed to the wall, but one in a\ncomparatively heavy frame, the lower edge of which was\nat about the height of the medium's shoulder when seated.\nI asked Molnar to make a ground-plan of his studio, and\nin this he exaggerated the distance between the table and\nthe wall to such an extent as to show them separated by\nhalf the length of the room, which is itself also exaggerated\nin relation to the width. This is a point of some im-\nportance, as will be seen from what follows.\nI now give a hteral translation (with comments in the\nright-hand column) of the German text of the official\nrecord of the first sitting ; this record was dictated by\nDr. von Pap in Hungarian, and translated into German\nby Mr. Rothy ; I then signed the original version subject\nto its being in agreement with the German text. Anyone\n^Figures 14-19 are reproduced from photographs very kindly given\nme by Dr. von Pap.\n^ Throughout this sitting, by \" the medium \" is to be understood\nMolnar, whom I controlled. Papp sat at the other side of the table,\nlargely invisible to me, and appeared to take an active share in the\nsitting in only one slight instance.\n\f452 Theodore Besterman [part\nwho has taken part in sittings for physical phenomena\nwill recognise the great difficulty of framing a report which\nshall not only meet with the approval of all the sitters\nbut also convey a fair impression to persons who were\nnot present. The record printed here is, in fact, better\nthan many documents of this kind, as much time was\nspent in compiling it, and it embodies suggestions from\nvarious sitters, including myself. It is quite accurate,\nindeed, so far as it goes. But much is omitted, and I\nthink that the impression a reader would gather from the\nreport, if it stood alone, would be misleading. Accord-\ningly, I have added some comments of my own.\nFIRST SITTING : MOLNAR AND PAPP.\nRecord of the sitting in the\nstudio of the painter Tibor\nMolndr, on the 14th of Novem-\nber [1928].\nPresent : Tibor Molnar,\nLajos Papp, as mediums, Dr.\nElemer von Pap, Messrs,\nLudwig Herkelyi, Karl Rothy,\nDevecis del Vecchio, Theodore\nBesterman, the two last as\ncontrollers of the left and\nright of the medium Molnar.\nAt the gramophone : Kellner,\nJun.\nThe sitting began at 8\no'clock in the evening, and\nconcluded at 9.30.\nWith the exception of young\nKellner, who worked the\ngramophone, all the sitters\ntook their places at the table,\nforming a chain and placing\ntheir hands on the table.\nPreviously all pockets had\nbeen emptied, and the sitters\nThe presence of this boy\ncannot be regarded as satis-\nfactory, but I am inclined to\nthink that he did not assist\nin the production of the\nphenomena.\nThe object of this search is\n.\nnot very clear ; external\n\fPLATE II.\n\fPLATE III.\n\fIll] Four Months'' Tour of Psychical Investigation 453\nsearched by one another, in order\nto establish whether all the\npockets were really empty.\nThe hair of both mediums and\nalso the beard of the medium\nPapp, and their pockets and\nclothes, were particularly ex-\namined and found empty. The\nmedium Molnar was particu-\nlarly searched by Mr. Bester-\nman, who found nothing on\nhim beyond his pocket-hand-\nkerchief.\nAll those present had phos-\nphorescent bands placed on\ntheir wrists and feet (shoe-\ncaps). During the sitting\nthere was continuous control.\nThe light-bands on hands and\nfeet were capable of being\ncontinuously observed and\nconsequently the phenomena\ncould apparently not have\nbeen produced by them [that\nis, by the hands and feet].\nThe ten phosphorescent discs\n[on the walls]. (40-50 [square]\ncentimetres [in area]) and the\nphosphorescent strips on the\ntable, provided so much light\nthat observation was always\npossible. Mr. Besterman was\nrepeatedly stroked from the\nknee to the armpit, received\nblows and attempts to tickle,\nand also touches on the left\nbreast. As all stood about a\nmetre from the table, repeated\nraps in the tempo of the\ngramophone were heard, then\npockets are the last places in\nwhich the medium or an\naccomplice would hide in-\ncriminating objects.\nThat is, I perfunctorily\ntapped his pockets. No sug-\ngestion was made that I\nshould undertake a real search\nand the kind of examination\nproposed was clearly useless.\nThe light -bands on the feet\nwere not worn on the shoe-cap\nbut rather further back on the\nshoe, as shown in figure 16.\nThe words in brackets, \" light-\nbands on,\" and \" apparently,\"\nwere inserted at my request.\nThe record omits to state\nthat before the formal begin-\nning of the sitting, and while\nthe two mediums and the boy\nKellner were in the partitioned-\no\u00a3E corner, a number of beans\nfell in the room.\nThese touches felt distinctly\nas if made by the toe-cap of\na shoe. Consequently I deter-\nmined to concentrate attention\non the light-bands round the\nmedium's feet. I soon ob-\nserved that the left band\nbehaved in the manner that\n\f454\nthe table rose without being\ntouched and made shaking\nmovements at a height of\nabout 15 to 20 centimetres.\nA box, closed with wire-\nnetting (aperture 8 mm.), the\nkey of which was in Mr.\nBesterman's possession, and in\nwhich, 8 cm. below the wire\nnetting, a sheet of clay had\nbeen prepared, was placed on\nthe table. All had to place\ntheir hands on the box, upon\nwhich, to the accompaniment\nof heavy pantings and con-\nvulsive twitchings on the part\nof the medium, the controlling\nspirit explained [verbally] that\nit was \" finished,\" whereupon a\npause was made. Immediately\nthereupon there were observed\non the clay in the still unopened\nbox, six scratches from 2 to 5\nmm. deep and about 2 mm.\nwide [see Plate IV, fig. 18].\n[part\nwould normally be expected in\na human foot. That is, it\nmade slight movements of\nvarious sorts. The right foot-\nband, however, was absolutely\nstill : it was impossible to\ndetect any movement in it,\nand it became quite clear to\nme that there was no foot in\nthe band. '\nAfter the series of touches\nhad been proceeding for a\nconsiderable while, the medium\nbegan stretching backwards on\nhis tilted chair, pulling the\ncontrolling hands with him.\nAt the same time he brought\nhis left hand, which was\ncontrolled at the wrist only,\nover to my side and tried to\npush my left hand, which was\ncontrolling his right hand\nrouiid the fingers, down to his\nwrist. I refused to allow this,\nand after three failures the\nmedium resumed his normal\nposition, calling out :\n\" Weak,\nno power.\" In a few minutes\nMolnar again started leaning\nback and pushing my hand\ndown to his wrist. This time\nI permitted him to do so.\nImmediately there followed, in\nthat order, scratching sounds\non the wall, as if the heavy\nframe had been moved, knocks\non the little table, movements\nof the box containing the clay,\nand scratches on its wire-\nnetting. During the whole of\nTheodore Besterman\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 455\nAfter a pause of about 15\nminutes, all, including Kellner,\ntook their places at a distance\nof about one metre from the\ntable. In response to the wish\nof the controlling spirit the\ngramophone had to be played\nagain. On the table behind\nthe medium were heard raps\nin the temi^o of the music. The\nlight-bands at hands and feet\nwere now particularly observed.\nDuring the raps it was ob-\nserved that the light-band at\nthe edge of the table was\nobscured, as if by a shadow\nthis time there had been\nproceeding movements and\nlevitations of the larger table\nround which we sat, and I felt\ntouches on the right side of\nmy chest. These were, of\ncourse, aU reported at the\ntime. The placing of the box\non the table did not occur\nuntil 10 to 15 minutes after\nthe medium had resumed his\nnormal position and further\nraps and touches had taken\nplace. It was then that\nMolnar asked for the change\nin position of the box. The\nconvulsive twitchings of the\nmedium consisted largely of\nviolent blows with the palms\nof his hands on the box, and\nas my hand was round one\nof the palms in question, I\ndid not particularly enjoy this\npart of the phenomena.\nThat is, the boy Kellner had\nto leave the circle.\nThis shadow seemed to me\n\f456 Theodore Besterman [part\nwhich seemed to come from\nthe direction of the medium's\nbody. After this all had to\nmove to this table, on which,\nafter heavy blows on the table.\nDr. Pap (leader of the\nexperiments) asked whether an\nimpression on the clay had\nbeen made, which the con-\ntrolling spirit answered in the\naffirmative. In the meanwhile\nwas heard the sound of the\nfalling of small objects on the\nother table. Later six beans\nand a pebble were fomid in\nthe locked room. In the\nsculptors' clay placed at the\nunderside of the table were\nobserved several scratches [see\nPlate IV, fig. 19].\nto have exactly the shape of\na shoe. At the moment this\nphenomenon occurred there\nwere no raps and no touches.\nThese blows were, of course,\nproduced by the medium's\nhands.\nMolnar would probably have\nhad some difficulty in produc-\ning these \" apports,\" but it\nmust not be forgotten that\nPapp, a specialist in apports,\nas we shall see in the account\nof the sitting with him, was\npresent all this time, under\nproblematical control.\nOn the conclusion of the\nphenomena the medium vio-\nlently tore his hands out of\ncontrol and collapsed in a heap\non the floor with his hands\nand feet under his body. The\ncontrol was resumed in a few\nseconds and the sitting brought\nto a close.\n(Signed by all present except\nthe medium Papp.)\nMy conclusion after the sitting was that the medium\nwithdrew his right foot from the light-band, which re-\nmained on the floor. These Kght-bands have both sides\nluminous, but only half of their circumference, so that\nwhether on or oil the medium's foot, the same semi-circle\nof luminosity is always visible. The only difference is that\n\fPLATE IV.\nFig. 10.\n\f\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 457\nthe light-band, when on the medium's foot, has a sUghtly\nmore fiUed-out appearance than when off the medium's foot.\nI was not able to detect the difference with certainty until\nafter about haK-an-hour's close observation. It may be\nworth adding that these bands are fitted with press-\nbuttons, and that the medium wore pointed shoes.\nHaving thus obtained the free use of a leg the medium\nin my opinion produced with it the table raps and touches.\nA distant touch, as on my shoulder or on my right side,\nwas always preceded by the medium stretching backwards\nand sideways away from me. It is said that sitters at the\nside of the table opposite to that of the medium have\nsometimes felt touches, but this did not occur at my\nsittings. The scratches on the clay in the box were\nproduced, in my opinion (as formed during the sitting),\neither by means of one of the nails with wliich several\ncanvasses were fastened to the wall behind the medium,\nor by means of a pencil-Hke piece of wood hidden behind\nthe heavy frame or elsewhere. After I had seen the\nscratches it was clear that their size and their depth below\nthe wire-netting precluded the use of a nail, and this\nmade me conclude that the hypothetical piece of wood was\nthe instrument used. In the light of this theory, it\nbecame possible to understand the medium's behaviour\nbefore the scratches were made. It seemed to me that he\npushed my hand down to his wrist in order to free his\nright hand ; and that he then stretched back and pulled\nout the piece of wood secreted behind the frame, which\nwas somewhat to his right, and thus necessitated the use\nof liis right hand. This would explain the scratching\nsounds on the wall ; these were foUowed by knocks on the\ntable, which appeared to me to have been caused by\ninvestigatory pokes with the \" pencil \" until the top of\nthe box was found, thus producing the scratcMng sounds\non the wire-netting. (It will be remembered that when\nMohiar was asked to make a plan of his room, he altered\nthe proportions in such a way as to make it seem quite\nimpossible for him to reach the wall while seated at the\ntable.) During the whole of these manoeuvres the medium\nhad the free use of his right leg, and, supporting his tilted\n2a\n\f458 Theodore Besterman [part\nchair with his left leg, there was nothing to prevent him\ntouching me or moving the central table with the other.\nThe scratches in the clay below the table I considered\nto have been clearly produced by means of a similar\ninstrument held by the toes of the foot, the object used\nbeing in this case probably secreted in the medium's shoe.\nIn any case, the medium would have had ample oppor-\ntunities during the pause, no search being made after it,\nto provide himself with such an instrument. This theory\nwould explain the foot-like shadow against the leg of the\ntable (at which time there were no raps and touches), and\nthe violent withdrawal from control seemed to me intended\nto provide the medium with an opportunity for putting\non and lacing his shoe.\nAfter the sitting I made discreet inquiries, at a meeting\nof the Budapest Society for Psychical Research and else-\nwhere, from gentlemen who had attended sittings with\nMolnar, and elicited the following facts. It seems that\nsome time before my visit a local notability who had\nbeen invited to a sitting had suddenly switched on a torch\nand had declared that he had seen Molnar's foot out of\nits light-band. The other sitters had denied his assertion.\nI was told, further, that some months before Molnar had\nannounced, during the course of a sitting, that in addition\nto the marks in the clay in the larger independent box,\nhe would materialise the object with wliich Consuelo (his\ncontrolling spirit) had produced the scratches. And, in\nfact, when the box was examined there was found beneath\nthe wire-netting, lying on the clay, a thin piece of wood\nsome inches in length. (Dr. von Pap had shown me at\nthe time of my sitting a series of envelopes, carefully\narranged and numbered, in which he was preserving the\napports produced in Molnar's sittings. I did not recollect\nhaving seen the described piece of wood amongst these\nobjects, and, on inquiry, was told by Dr. von Pap that\nhe had not preserved it.) Finally, it transpired that Dr.\nvon Pap himself had commented, at a sitting some time\nbefore, on the curious resemblance between the feel of\nthe ectoplasmic terminal and the toe of a shoe.^\n' This fact should perhaps make it unnecessary to point out that there\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 459\nThese facts not unnaturally removed my last doubts as\nto the validity of my hypothesis, and I informed my host,\nMr. Rothy, of my views. I gave Mr. Rothy a demonstration\nof how the actions which I ascribed to the medium could\nbe performed, and was fortunate enough to win him over to\nmy way of thinking. Having thus secured his assistance,\nI suggested that we should propose at the next sitting\nthat the medium should wear liis hght-bands round the\nankles ; I ventured to prophesy that the medium would\nrefuse this change in the position of the hght-bands, or his\ncontrolling spirit would request to have them removed,\nor there would be no phenomena.\nSECOND SITTING : TIBOR MOLNAR.\nI now reproduce, as before, a hteral translation of the\nGerman text of the official record made of the second\nsitting.\nRecord of the sitting on the\n17th of November, 1928.\nPlace and sitters as on the\n13th of the month, with the\nexception that Lajos Papp (the\nsecond medium of the previous\nsitting), left before the sitting\nowing to ill-health. To the\nsitters has to be added Dr.\nGeza Ujlaki. Medium : Tibor\nMolnar alone.\nThe sitting began at 8\no'clock in the evening, and\nconcluded at 9. The condi-\ntions were the same as on the\n13th, except that at the wish\nof several sitters the medium\nwore an additional light-band\nbelow the knee and that the\nDr. von Paj) consented very\nwillingly to the alterations\nproposed by me and supported\nby Mr. Rothy and by another\ngentleman to whom he had\ncommunicated my views.\nis not the slightest reflection in these proceedings against Dr. von Pap's\nabsolute integrity.\n\f460\nlight band on the shoe was\nfastened at the ankle.\nThe controlling spirit de-\nmanded that the previous\narrangement of the light-bands\nshould be resumed, but he was\nbegged to allow the new\narrangement to remain at least\nduring the first part of the\nsitting. On this the phenomena\nfailed to appear. In the pause\nTibor Molnar explained that\nhe was ill and complained of\npains in the region of the\nstomach. After a pause of\nabout 10 minutes the trance\ncondition did not return. As\nthe right hand of the medium\nmade movements as of writing,\na sheet of paper was placed\non the table, on which the\nfollowing words in Hungarian\nwere then to be read :\n\" Gy-\nenge vagyok ;\ngyomormerge-\nzisem van \" (I am weak,\nhave stomach poisoning).\n(Signed by all present.)\n[part\nMolnar objected strongly and\nhad to be reminded several\ntimes to place the light-bands\nin their new positions.\nThe words were, of course,\nwritten by the medium.\nTheodore Besterman\nIt will be seen that all three forecasts were thus realised :\nthe medium refused to have the Kght-bands in the new\npositions ; when these were insisted upon, the controlling\nspirit tried to have them removed ; and when this failed,\nno phenomena appeared. Further comment seems useless.\nTHIRD SITTING : LAJOS PAPP.\nOn the evening of the 18th of November took place a\nthree hours' sitting at the flat of Dr. Janos Toronyi, with\nthe medium Papp alone. The eight or nine sitters formed\na chain, with their hands on a light table, in total dark-\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 461\nness.^ I controlled the medium's right hand, and, observing\nthat there were three lines, hardly of light, but of lesser\ndarkness, at the edge of one of the windows on his left,\nI sat in such a way as to have the medium's head\nintercepting my hne of sight to these three faint hues.\nThe palms of the sitters were placed on the table and I\ncontrolled the medium's right hand by placing my hand\nover his fingers and thumb, and his foot by placing the\nsole of my foot on his toe-cap. I arranged with the\ncontroller of the medium's left side to adopt the same\nmethods. Almost immediately after the lights were\nextinguished, the table began moving and tapj)ing out\nmessages by means of which, during the course of half an\nhour, some twelve spirits announced themselves. One of\nthe sitters made a joke about this large influx from the\nspirit world, and the medium, supposed to be in deep\ntrance, laughed loudly.\nSoon followed levitations of the table, each such move-\nment being preceded by a backward movement of the\nmedium's head. This suggested the possibihty that the\nmedium was producing the movements with his left leg,\nfor I had liis right foot under good control. Accordingly,\nfrom time to time I asked the gentleman controlhng the\nmedium's left side whether he was guarding the latter's\nhand and foot, and was always met with an emphatic\naffirmative. But when the lights went up at the interval,\nI saw that this gentleman was \" controlhng \" the medium's\nleft leg by bringing the side of his own knee into contact\nwith that of the medium. In these circumstances\u2014it has\nbeen noted that the medium was always in movement,\noften quite violent\u2014he had the free use of his leg from\nthe knee down, and considerable freedom of the whole leg,\nquite enough to account for all movements of the table\nobserved so far.\nBut even this control, amounting, in eiTect, to freedom\nof one side, did not satisfy the controlhng spirits, who\ncarried out at this point an elaborate series of changes in\nthe positions of the sitters. Among other changes, a\n^ I was unable to note the exact number owing to changes, late\narrivals after the beginning of the sitting, etc.\n\f462 Theodore Bester man [PAET\nyoung man who was present in order to develop his\nmediumistic powers, was expelled with a good deal of\nemphasis, and the medium's left side was now to be\ncontrolled by a certain gentleman of an uncritically\nspirituaUstic type. Several sitters were told to leave. On\nthe resumption of the sitting, the same unevidential table\nmovements recommenced, and three objects, which were\nlater discovered to be beans, were heard to fall on the\ntable. Even if the probably too conservative assumption\nbe adopted that the medium had not succeeded in\ngetting his left hand out of control, it must be noted\nthat Papp is an abnormally silent man, and could easily\nhave secreted the beans in his mouth. We shall have\noccasion to return to this point in connection with\nsimilar occurrences at a later stage of the sitting.\nThe medium is a large and very powerful man, and after\nhe had repeatedly tried and failed to pass off my left hand\non the left controller as his own (the medivim's) left hand,\nhe began, and continued for about five minutes, a series\nof most violent contortions and constrictions of his massive\nhands. The controller of the medium's left hand simply\nlet it go, and I myself, in order to retain control, had to\nrise and circle round the medium. On this Papp redoubled\nhis extraordinary convulsions, until I began to suspect that\nthese, to me, painful manoeuvres, were performed in order\nto oblige me to release control of his foot ;\nand, indeed,\nin order to avoid this, I fear that in the acrobatic evolu-\ntions necessary in the darkness to retain control of the\nmedium's hand and foot, I was obliged from time to time\nto step pretty hard on the latter, though not, I trust, to\nthe extent of causing the medium any inconvenience. My\nown hand, at any rate, was stiff and sore for two days\nafterwards.\nHalf-way through the sitting a short pause was made,\nduring the whole of which the medium was out of the\nseance-room. In the second part of the sitting there was\na nominal red hght, but this was so faint that its presence\nwas only realised when it was looked at. I had been\ninformed that it was customary for the more important\napports to be produced in the second portions of these\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 463\nsittings. I therefore observed the medium very carefully\nand noted that up to the time when three stones, the\nlargest of which was afterwards found to be about two\ninches across, fell with a clatter on the floor, the medium\nhad uttered no word of any kind. It was unfortunately\nimpossible to examine the apports for moisture, for the\nsitting did not conclude until an hour after their arrival.\nImmediately on the resumption of the sitting there\nbegan a scene of the utmost violence. All the sitters\nwere told to rise, and the table, with the hands of the\n\" sitters \" and of the medium on it, moved rapidly all\nover the room. It made a determined effort to get into\nan adjoining room, an effort which unfortunately failed.\nThe medium then reseated himself, and there followed a\nseries of violent simultaneous movements of the table and\nof his chair. These evolutions kept the sitters in rapid\nand continuous movement all over the large room for\nabout half an hour. But the more violent the movements\nof the table and chair became, the less the medium was\nable to control himself, and the more noticeable became\nhis own movements. At last his heavy breathing, the\nmovements of his head or shoulders (according to his\nposition) against the strips of light at the window, the\nmuscular tensions of his hand and of his body ( a leg\ncontrol was out of the question) enabled me to form what\nappeared to me an exact picture of the manner in which\nthe medium was producing the table and chair movements.\nAs I was vmwilhng, though greatly tempted, to abandon\nmy rule of obedience to the prescribed conditions of pro-\ncedure, which in this case included an injunction against\nbreaking the circle,^ I was only once able to j)ut this to\nthe test. On this occasion I had visualised the medium\ndragging his chair behind him with his left foot, pushing\nthe table with his chest, and from time to time stopping\nand knocking it up with his right knee in order to give\nthe appearance of a levitation. During one of these\n^ I should like to say, however, that at practically all the sittings I\nhave ever attended these prescribed conditions were being constantly\nbroken by the mediums' friends themselves, and the present sitting was\nno exception.\n\f464 Theodore Besiermdn [part\nknocks the sitter at my right let go my hand ; I took\nadvantage of this rapidly and hghtly to pass it over the\nmedium's body, the position of which I found to corres-\npond exactly with what I had supposed.\nAt a given moment the medium, by now thoroughly\nexhausted and perspiring profusely, flung himseK at full\nlength on a couch which stood against one of the walls,\nand at the foot of which lay a number of cushions. I\nnow stationed myseK by the side of the couch, kneehng\nwith my left leg on it and against the side of the medium's\nleft leg, and still holding his right hand. On either side\nof me the sitters re-formed the circle, with the table in\ntheir midst. I now saw, against the light strips at the\nwindow, the medium's left hand, quite free, reaching out\ntowards the table. I immediately took hold of it with my\nright hand, and henceforth I controlled both hands during\nthe whole time that the medium was on the couch. Later\nthe medium's left hand was also held by the sitter on my\nleft, and my left hand, holding the medium's right, was\nsimilarly held by the sitter on my right. Under these\nconditions it was impossible for the medium to come into\nnormal contact with the table ; and during the twenty\nminutes or so that this position was maintained, the table\nmade not the slightest movement.\nBut this period was by no means free from phenomena,\nfor the cushions at the medium's feet, one of which it was\nunfortunately impossible for me to control, leaped into the\nroom one after the other. Whenever they were replaced\n(always at the medium's feet !), they were again flung off\nthe couch. Later, the medium groped with his hands for\nthe table and, laying them on it, pushed himself off the\ncouch with liis full weight and strength. Now the table\ncame to hfe. The sitters and the medium resumed their\nprevious decorous places around it, and movements and\nmessages recommenced. At this point I was practically\ncertain that the whole performance was fraudulent ; con-\nsequently, with less fear of offending the medium's feelings,\nI placed my left foot between and in contact with both\nhis feet. At the same time I categorically requested the\ngentleman controlling the medium's left side (though at\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 465\nthis moment he was certainly not controlhng his left foot),\nto inform me whether he had the medium's left hand\nunder proper control. I repeated this question several\ntimes, at intervals, and was always met with an indignant\naffirmative. Nevertheless, during this period, when, it\nmust be remembered, I had full control of the medium's\nright hand and of both his feet, and when I was able to\nsee his head and any object that might occupy the space\nin front of it, against the lines of light at the window,\nthere occurred movements and levitations of the table.\nThese phenomena were thus very impressive, and had it\nbeen possible to feel confidence in the other controller's\nnotion of control, it would have been necessary to admit\nthat these movements were not produced by the medium.\nMy fears as to the nature of the control of the left\nhand were, however, verified by a fortunate accident.\nDuring the sitting one of the ladies present was taken\nby an epileptoid seizure, with characteristic flapping move-\nments of the hands. With one of these movements she\nstruck against the electric light button which hung over\nthe table. The sudden hght revealed the medium, with\nhis left hand controlled at the wrist only, grasping one\nof the legs of the light table, which was_ in partial process\nof being levitated. The medium, thus discovered in\nflagrante delicto, immediately flung himself on the floor at\nfull length, and with great violence tiirned and twisted\nhimself round and round Uke a giant top, until repeated\nmagnetic strokings, administered by two sitters at the cost\nof severe kicks on the shins, had counteracted the injurious\neffects of the svidden illumination. As soon as the medium\nhad recovered and I had assured myself that he had\nreceived no permanent injuries, I informed one of the\nsitters of my views and took my leave.\nVII. ZAKARIASNE PAPP : BUDAPEST.\nWhile in Budapest I was strongly advised to visit a Frau\nPapp, who, I was informed, was a clairvoyante of such\nremarkable powers that on the last occasion she had been\n\f466 Theodore Besterman [part\nsummoned by the police, the latter had been unable to\nobtain a conviction owing to the quahty of the evidence\nput forward on her behalf. Such an opportunity naturally\nwas not to be missed, and in company with a police\nofficial, who translated the medium's Hungarian into Ger-\nman, I took the opportunity of calHng upon Frau Papp.\nI was not favourably impressed by her methods ; she made\nconsiderable use, for instance, of the well-known formula :\n\" Is your grandmother hving ?\n\"\n\"No.\"\n\" Just so. I saw an old lady by your side.\"\nFrom the point at which I politely refused to answer\nquestions, the medium made 37 specific statements referring\nto family, professional, and financial matters. Of these\nthirty-one were incorrect, and six partially or wholly\ncorrect ; the whole of these six related to matters which\nwere quite or largely obvious, such as, that I was inter-\nested in psychical research, and had recently made a long\njourney.\nVIII. LUJZA IGNATH: BUDAPEST.\nIn Budapest I also had the pleasure of making the\nacquaintance of Frau Lujza Ignath. I had previously been\ngiven a great deal of information about this lady by Mr.\nRothy, who has had a considerable number of sittings with\nher, and particularly by Frau Lujza Lamacs-Haugseth,\nwho has had the opportunity of studying Frau Ignath\nduring a long period of time and on intimate terms, and\nwho has written an account of her in the publications of\nthe Norwegian Society for Psychical Research.\nIt appears, then, that Frau Ignath presents a case of\nmultiple personality, one of these personaUties being\napparently endowed with supernormal faculties, both of a\nmental and of a physical type, but chiefiy characterised\nby clairvoyance. On the evening of the 15th of November\nI was present at one of the rare sittings now given by\nFrau Ignath, who is fully occupied with her business. I\nformed part of an avidience of nineteen persons, nearly all\nwomen, some of whom were called to her side by Nona,\n\fIll] Four Months'' Tour of Psychical Investigation 467\nas the clairvoyant secondary personality is named. I was\nunable to observe any substantial differences of expression\nor of psychic characteristics between Frau Ignath and\nNona, whose appearance was preceded by a rubbing of\nthe eyes. At first sight the clairvoyant, or at any rate\nthe telepathic, phenomena shown by Nona seemed very\nimpressive, for written questions were answered in a\nseemingly satisfactory manner without being read. But it\nappeared, on inquiry, that all those who had been called\nup, with one exception, were old friends of Frau Ignath.\nThe questions answered and the information given to the\nlady forming this exception, appeared veridical, but as the\nproceedings took j^lace exclusively in Hungarian, and as I\nwas dependent on whispered translations, I scarcely feel\ncompetent to pronounce an opinion. This exceptional case,\nhowever, has some interest from another point of view.\nI had naturally hoped to be among those called upon by\nNona, only to be informed by her that she never under-\ntook to give information to people at their first sitting,\nand this though she had a few minutes previously called\nupon the lady just mentioned.\nDuring the course of the sitting Nona hypnotised, in\nexcellent professional style, a young girl of shghtly hys-\nterical type, and gave her the common post-hypnotic\nsuggestion that she was to ask for a glass of water on\nawakening, which she duly did. At the conclusion of the\nsitting both Nona and Frau Ignath were good enough to\nsay that they would be very happy now to give me a\npersonal sitting.\nThis was arranged for the evening of the 16th at Frau\nLamacs-Haugseth's hotel. Owing to the illness of her\nchild and other reasons, Frau Ignath was unfortunately\nobhged to be very late, and during the short time that\nshe was able to remain, Nona did not manifest, to Frau\nIgnath's great regret. However, she expressed great\nanxiety to satisfy my interest and a further appointment\nwas made for the afternoon of the 19th, at the same\nplace.\nOn my arrival I learned with regret that Frau Ignath\nhad met with a slight accident and was laid up. She had\n\f468 Theodore Besterman [part\nwarmly invited me, however, to come to her flat, which\nI was very glad to do. I enjoyed a two-and-a-haK hours'\nconversation with her, during which I learned of many of\nher striking feats of clairvoyance. Before my departure I\nleft with Frau Ignath the test-tube II provided by\nDr. Moll,^ and being requested by her to put three\nquestions, I asked :\n\" What is in it ?\n\" \" Who has put\nit together ?\n\" \" Whence has it come ?\n\" together with a\nrequest to Nona to add whatever she pleased.\nThe following morning Frau Lamacs-Haugseth telephoned\nto say that a few minutes after I had left the previous\nevening, Nona had appeared and had made a statement\nabout the contents of the tube, but that this was only of\na preliminary nature. I therefore decided to leave the\ntest-tube with Frau Ignath, Frau Lamacs-Haugseth kindly\nundertaking to forward it to me as soon as Nona had\ncompleted her determination of its contents. The test-tube\nhas since been returned to me and by me to Dr. Moll,\ntogether with the clairvoyant statements made by Nona.\nDr. Moll considers this experiment to have been a total\nfailure, and with this I agree. Several persons, however,\nto whom I have shown the papers, consider this view\nmistaken, and that Nona was partially successful. I\ntherefore give a literal translation from the German of the\nreports of Frau Lamacs-Haugseth and of Dr. Moll.\nOn the 22nd of November 1928, Frau Lamacs-Haugseth\nwrote to me as follows :\n\" According to our arrangement,\non the 20th of November I showed to Frau Ignath's\niVorta-individuality the phial II left by you in Budapest\non the 18th of November, and now communicate to you\nthe following :\nI asked Nona the questions formulated by us on the 18th\nof November in the presence of Frau Ignath, who was then\nunwell\n:\n[Here follow the questions printed above.]\nBut first I must repeat what I told you on the 19th, that\nNona appeared on the previous day after we had both left\nbecause you had another engagement and we could therefore\n^ See page 412 above.\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 469\nnot wait until the iVoria-conscionsness manifested. Nona told\nHerr Ignath and Herr Olah, briefly, that in the phial there is\nnot only writing, but also something else, something that\nconcerns many people, and which is at present followed by\nfew, though later many will follow it ; she would say more\nabout the matter later.\nOn the 20th she said the following about the phial II,\nabout 15 cm. long, about 2 cm. in diameter, closed with a\nsolid white substance. Nona spoke Hmigarian, I translate her\nwords :\n*\n'\nI answer all the questions together, as I see it in pictures.\n'\nA man has made this, three men saw it. This thing\noriginates from a wise head who is honoured by many people,\nand whose words are attended to by many people. He is led\nby love, which he would like to introduce into human souls.\nBut at heart this wiU be more believed in if convincing\ninformation comes from the other side.\n'\nThe meaning of that Avhich is in the glass plays an im-\nportant role for mankind. I see pictures before me ;\nwriting,\ndust, flowers, wood, stone, bones ; all this comes together, I\ndo not know why, but I see it so.\n'\nThose who open this glass will be convinced of a thing\nwhich hitherto no one knew with certainty, the immortality of\nthe soul, a thing which interests all men. A few who have\ncome to it through personal experiences recognise it, but the\nmass of mankind will recognise it more after the passage of\nmuch time. I see many, many people whose happiness depends\nupon this recognition. This is a great, eternal thing ; so long\nas there will be men, this will also exist. Love, love, love over\nall, as much here on earth as on the other side, whence come\nthis information and this inspiration. This inspiration and this\nwish shall be believed in and followed.\n'\nThis glass and its contents come from far, far beyond the\nhome of the man who brought it here ; lands and water and\nlanguages lie between.\n'\nWhat have I myself to add ? When these my words are\nread it will be said that I am unsystematic. This is true.\nThis is my failing since the beginning, since I am, since the\ncreation of the world, as I also was there. But if my words\nare read and correctly understood, and compared with the\n\f470 Theodore Besterman [part\nessence of the contents of the phial, then it will be seen that\nmy words agree with the essence and the meaning of its\ncontents. And then one can oneseK introduce system into my\nanswer.'\n\"\nI sent this report, together with the phial, to Dr. Moll,\nwho replied :\nThe test-tube contained black paper, such as that used for\nthe packing of photographic plates ; within this was placed a\npart of the cover of a work ; on this part appears the following\ntitle :\nDiKETTORE DEL MaNICOMIO DI TeRAMO (AbRUZZI-ItALIA)\nWhat Nona said is for the larger part mere verbiage ; it\nis quite certain that the description is not correct.\nProe. M. Levi Bianchini\nPresbiogenesi\ndisfrenie e displasie presbiogeniche\n(Generazione tardiva e malformazioni\nsomatoj)sichiche del fenotipo)\n[Nona]\nA man has made this.\nThree men saw it. Four people were present\nwith me. I cut the piece from\nthe cover. At the cutting my\nsecretary and my technical\nassistant were also present ;\nbut they did not see what it\nwas ;\nduring the packing there\nwas also the housekeeper.\nThat is correct.\n[Dr. Moll's comments]\nThis thing originates from\na wise head.\nAs to whether I am wise I\nshould not like to express an\nopinion, nor concerning the\ncontinuation ;\ncompliments\nnearly always form the intro-\nduction.\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 471\nThat which is in the glass\nplaya an important role for\nmankind.\nI see pictures before me ;\nwriting, dust, flowers, wood,\nstone, bones.\nThose who open this glass\nwill be convinced of a thing,\netc.\nThe glass and its contents\ncome from far, far beyond the\nhome of the man who brought\nit here ; lands and water and\nlanguages lie between them.\nI do not know whether it\nplays such an important role.\nAt any rate there were\nneither flowers, nor wood, nor\nstone, nor bones in it.\nI do not believe that the\ncontents have made so deep\nan impression on anybody as\nis here described.\nThis must no doubt refer to\nyou, Mr. Besterman. But if\nso, the description does not\napply to Germany [the test-\ntube was originally sent to me\nfrom Berlin to Munich, and\nFrau Ignath knew that I came\nfrom England] ; for the glass\nwould have had to have come\nfrom America, perhaps from\nGreenland, or the Arctic\nregions.\nI think that it is hardly worth while to discuss the matter\nfurther.\nIt is difficult to imagine that any experiment could have a\nless positive result than this one ; the contents are obviously\nnot recognised at all. Not even the statement about the three\nmen is accurate, none of those present saw the contents,\nnobody had previously read the leaf ; I had taken it at random\nfrom a quantity of printed matter and had cut it without\nseeing it myself.\nHowever, the experiment is very instructive from a negative\npoint of view. We had to smash the glass in order to get at\nthe contents.\nI have to thank Frau Lamacs-Haugseth for the time and\ntrouble she took to make this experiment possible.\n\f472 Theodore Besterman [part\nIX. ANNA KARLIK: BERLIN.\nWhile I was in Berlin I made inquiries as to available\nmediums, and was informed that the only physical medium\nwith any reputation is Frau \" Volhardt.\" This medium is\nstudied by Professor Schroder, who was unfortunately\nunwilling to give me facihties for making her acquaintance.\nAmong the mental mediums, I was informed by several\npsychical researchers, Frau Karlik and Peter Johanson are\nthe most successful. By the kindness of Herr Rudolf\nGrossmann, I was enabled to have a sitting with each of\nthese mediums.\nFrau Anna Karhk is an elderly woman who has a\nconsiderable reputation in Berlin.^ She does not go into\ntrance, but gives information as to character, the future,\nand so on, while in a more or less normal state of\nconsciousness. I called on her in company with Herr and\nFrau Grossmann and Herr von Brentano. In view of the\nvery favourable reports made to me of Frau Karhk's\nsupernormal faculties, I have thought it right to put my\nsitting with her on record. But to give an account of\nthis lengthy sitting would be superfluous. Not a single\none of the statements made to the four sitters was correct\nor, if correct, evidential. In these circumstances it\nseems scarcely worth while to do more than record the\nbare fact.\nX. PETER JOHANSON: BERLIN\nJohanson specialises in psychometry and has a large\nfollowing. He is a man of striking personahty and\nphysical appearance, and he makes use of the latter to\nhypnotise (using this word in its popular sense) his more\nimpressionable chents. I paid a visit to him accompanied\nby the same lady and gentlemen as above. Johanson was\n* Cp. Anna Karlik. Anerkennungen und Kritiken iXbcr hellseherische\nund psychometrische Sitzungen, sowie Ausziige aus Sitzungsprotokollen\n(Berlin [1928]).\n\fIll] Four Months^ Tour of Psychical Investigation 473\na little more successful than Frau KarHk, for he analysed\nHerr von Brentano's character in a manner that seemed\nsomewhat to impress the latter. Subsequent discussion,\nhowever, showed that all the statements made by Johan-\nson could easily have been deduced from facts known to\nhim. Jolianson was quite unsuccessful in all his statements\nreferring to the other three sitters.\nXI. LUDWIG KAHN: BERLIN.\nHerr Grossmann also very kindly made an appointment\nfor me in his own flat with Ludwig Kahn, who has been\nvery well known for many years as a clairvoyant. Quite\nrecently the results produced by him at sittings in Paris\ngreatly impressed the French investigators.^ I was there-\nfore gratified at this unexpected opportunity of meet-\ning him. Unfortunately Kahn was over an hour late at\nour first appointment, at which Dr. Dessoir was also\npresent, and when he arrived said that he was too tired\nto undertake any experiments. He made another appoint-\nment for the evening of the same day, which he subse-\nquently cancelled. And no efforts would induce him to\nmake another appointment during the remaining day that\nI was to be in Berlin.\nLater, however, a sitting was arranged for Dr. Dessoir\n(under an assumed name, as before), and of this sitting\nDr. Dessoir has kindly sent me a report, with permission\nto publish it. A literal translation of this report follows :\n\" Sittiyig on the 7th of December at the home of Rudolf\nGrossmann.\nPresent : Ludwig Kahn, Herr von Brentano, Professor\nDessoir, Rudolf Grossmann.\nKahn takes a sheet of paper brought by Dessoir, tears\nfrom it three pieces of equal size, and asks one of the\nthree gentlemen to write something on his piece of paper\nand to fold it while he [Kahn] is out of the room. From\n1 See E. Osty, \" Un Homme doue de connaissance paranormale, M.\nLudwig Kahn,\" Revue Metapsychique (Paris 1925), pp. 65-79, 132-143 ;\nCharles Richet, Notre sixieme sens (Paris [1927]), pp. 178-190.\n2h\n\f474 Theodore Besterman [part\nthe remaining part of the sheet Kahn tears a part and\nleaves a piece of exactly the same size as those distributed\nto the sitters. After he has left the room, the folder\ncontaining this j^iece of paper is removed at Dessoir's\nrequest. Kahn returns, asks to be shown the three\npieces of paper, held by Dessoir, and requests that they\nbe uniformly folded. Then he asks Grossmann for paper\nand pencil. He now receives a piece of paper of totally\ndifferent appearance and has no chance to effect the\nsubstitution which he had perhaps planned. He demands\nthat the three gentlemen should sit in a row, and against\nthe light, requests Dessoir to remove his glasses, and\nasks to be given one of the folded papers for a short time.\nHe then returns this paper and begins a conversation,\nafter Dessoir has given the other two papers to the\ngentlemen sitting by him. So passes a quarter of an hour,\nthen Herr Kahn explains that he cannot arrive at the\nnecessary concentration and begs for a new sitting for\nTuesday, the 11th of December, at 11 o'clock. This\nsitting he afterwards cancelled.\"\nFrom Berlin I proceeded to Copenhagen, where I hoped\nto have sittings with the physical medium Einar Nielsen.\nUnfortunately, however, notwithstanding the appeals of\nProfessor Winther and of two of his supporters, Nielsen\nrefused to give me a sitting.\nXII. PASCAL FORTHUNY: PARIS.\nOn my return to Paris for further sittings with Mme.\nKahl, I had the opportunity of sittings with several other\nmental mediums. Chief amongst these was Pascal For-\nthuny, with whom the French investigators have obtained\nvery remarkable results.^\nI made M. Forthuny's acquaintance during the course\nof a pubhc demonstration given by him of his supernormal\nfaculties. Some of the phenomena then witnessed were\ndistinctly impressive ; but all the persons concerned being\n^ See E. Osty, Une Faculte de connaissance supra-normale : Pascal\nForthuny (Paris 1926).\n\fIll] Four Months' Tour of Psychical Investigation 475\nunknown to me, I could attach but little evidential impor-\ntance to phenomena thus pubhcly obtained. Fortunately,\nM. Forthuny very readily agreed to give me a private\nsitting, which duly took place.\nAt this sitting, which lasted about an hour, M. Forthuny\nmade a number of statements, about half of which were\naccurate. Amongst these were two which appear to be\nexcellent examples of thought-transference, and one of\nthem even contains what seems to be an element of\nprevision. Unfortunately, both these cases are of a private\nnature, and cannot be pubhshed. I have, however, put\nthem on record and submitted them to Mrs. Salter, whose\nopinion is as follows : \"I have seen Mr. Besterman's\nreport of the two incidents which occurred during his\nsitting with M. Forthuny. Both of them seem to me to\nshow good evidence of knowledge supernormally acquired,\nbeing quite beyond chance-coincidence. In the second case\nit seems all but impossible to suppose that M. Forthuny\nshould have acquired the knowledge by any normal means,\nand this is very improbable in the first.\" This record has\nbeen filed in the Society's Rooms.\nAmong the remaining incidents may be mentioned M.\nForthuny's very emphatic assertion that I am totally\nunmusical. This is quite true. M. Forthuny's statement\nimpressed me the more as every previous medium with\nwhom I have ever sat, who has touched on this point,\nhas described me as musical. Nevertheless, the odds\nagainst a chance success are of course very small.\nLater in the sitting M. Forthuny said : \"At last you've\ngot the rooms as you wanted them . . . no, it's two\nrooms ... at last you have the desk as you wanted it\n. . . at last the electric hght has been changed . . . how\npleased you are !\n\" All this apphes with complete accuracy\nto the recent reorganisation of the Society's Library. It\nis quite hkely that M. Forthuny had heard of this ; but\nit is extremely unhkely that he should have known\nabout the desk and the hght, for in order to see that\nchanges have been made in these respects it would be\nnecessary to have a clear recollection of the Library's\nappearance before the alterations. M. Forthuny has never\n\f476 Theodore Besterman [part\nbeen in England, and anyone likely to mention the re-\norganisation of the Library to him would be most unlikely\nto have such a recollection, and even if so, would hardly\ngo out of his way to mention these details.\nThe Society hopes to have further sittings with M.\nForthuny, and in the meanwhile I have to thank him for\nhaving so readily given me an opportunity of witnessing\nhis supernormal faculties in action.\nXIII. RENE DAUMAL: PARIS.\nI took advantage of my presence in Paris to make the\nacquaintance of M. Rene Maublanc, who has repeated M.\nJules Romains's experiments into an alleged \" paroptic\n\"\nfaculty. 1 M. Maublanc kindly allowed me to participate\nin one of his sittings with a young student, M. Rene\nDaumal, with whom he is at present experimenting, and\nalso to arrange one sitting with him myself. I now give\na literal translation of the record of the former sitting.\n\" Paroptic experiments\u2014Thursday, the 20th of December\n1928, at 15.30, in the flat of Rene Maublanc, 9 Avenue de\nrObservatoire, with Rene Daumal, in the presence of Mr.\nTh. Besterman and of Andre Cuisenier, Professor at the\nLycce Rollin.\nFirst series. Daumal, his eyes bandaged, lies down on a\ncouch. His face is covered with a red cloth.\n1. R. Maublanc puts into his hands a book of very\nsmall format chosen by Mr. Besterman [chosen, that is,\nfrom among a number of volumes in the same series\noffered to me] {La belle et la bete, Payot, Collection Minia-\nture). The cover of this book is of cloth : background old\ngold, with small flowers in white, mauve and pink, with\nvery small green leaves and black stalks. The light is very\nbad.\nAnswer :\n'\nThe general colour is mauve. I also see\nyellow and black. I see rather vague designs in mauve\noutlined in black, and within longish yellow spots. The\n1 See L. H. Heyn and R. Maublanc, TJne education paroptique (Paris\n1926) ;\ncp. JounK S.P.R.

It is an irregularly\nmarbled paper, in the following colours : blue-green, light\ngreen, sap-green {vert cle vessie), and reddish brown, the\nwhole rather dull.\nAnswer :\n'\nA yellow background with rather light mauve\nspots. A few smaller and triangular red spots. I see\ngreen hues outlining a red spot.'\n3. Mr. Besterman chooses another book of the same\ncollection and format : Cent epigramnies grecqiies. Cloth\ncover : very dark blue-violet background, round and oval\nred spots, with black lines in the middle, grey-green leaves.\nAnswer :\n'\nIn general, dark violet with some red and\nyellow spots. The violet is very dark. kSome lines rather\nlighter than the violet.'\n4. Fly-leaf. Wine-red background, regular blue-grey\nspots, the larger spindle-shaped, the smaller round. The\nlatter surrounded by gold dots.\nAnswer :\n'\nI see green, pale blue, orange-yellow. The\nwhole is slate blue.'\nThe light being very bad, R. Maublanc projects the\nlight of an electric lamp [on to the fly-leaf].\nAnswer :\n'\nThin red and yellow lines forming large curves,\nand some blue-grey. The yellow is in rather irregular\nround spots. The grey is in large strips.'\n5. R. Maublanc returns to Daumal the cover of La belle\net la bete, illuminating it with the electric light.\nAnswer :\n'\nI see a brighter red on a blue background.\nThe red is perhaps a very bright yellow forming large\nspots between a vague circle of blue spots, with toothed\ncontours.'\n6. Fly-leaf of La belle et la bete.\nAnswer :\n'\nObliquely elongated green spots on a yellow\nbackground. The green is greyish and rather dull. The\nyellow is rather pale and dull, it is more hke beige or very\nhght brown.'\nSecond series.\n1. In a wooden box open on one side only and lighted\nwith an electric lamp placed inside, R. Maublanc places\n\f478 Theodore Besterman [part\ntwo pla3dng cards chosen by Mr. Besterman : on the left\nthe three of diamonds, on the right the ten of spades.\nAnswer :\n'\nOn the left a red card ; on the right a\nblack one. The red is diamonds, the black spades. On\nthe spades there are many spots ; it is the ten. On the\nleft is the eight of diamonds, but I am not quite sure.'\nAll these answers are made rapidly, nobody else saying\na word. R. Maublanc then said :\n'\nIf you are not sure,\nlook again more carefully.' Daumal, who has so far been\nusing his left hand, now puts his right one near the\ncards, and says :\n'\nI now see the spades on the left, with\nfew spots. It must be the five. No, the six or the three.'\n2. Mr. Besterman chooses two other cards which R.\nMaublanc puts in the box [this is incorrect, they were put\nin by me] ; the two of diamonds on the left, the ten of\nclubs on the right.\nAnswer :\n'\nIt is again diamonds on the left, and clubs\non the right. I am no longer sure whether it is diamonds\nor hearts ; in any case it is a two. The clubs is the\nfive or the eight ;\nprobably the five. '\n\"\nIt may be added that these cards are placed side by\nside in a slit provided inside the small box ;\nthey are\noutside the medium's hne of sight. These results were\ninteresting enough to justify a further sitting, and M.\nMaublanc and his subject kindly came to my hotel the\nfollowing day. A series of colour and card experiments\nwas tried with the medium's eyes securely bandaged, but\nwithout any apparatus. The results were as follows.\nObject.

Carita Borderieux, who has been\nstudying psychical phenomena for many years. This lady\nhas recently taken up the study of so-called \" thinking\n\"\nanimals, and has herseK trained a \" calculating \" dog, a\nmongrel spaniel named Zou.^ Mme. Borderieux kindly\ninvited me to witness some of the feats of this dog. She\ntold me that he is able to answer such questions as lend\nthemselves to a simple affirmative or negative reply, and\nthat he is able to perfoi'ni simple sums in addition,\nsubtraction and multiplication.\nThe procedure is as follows : Zou is placed in close\nproximity to a box of biscuits, Mme. Borderieux seats\nherseK opposite him, addresses a question to him or states\nthe problem to be solved, puts out her hand, and on this\n^ See C. Borderieux, Les nouveaux animaux pensants (Paris 1927), and\nthe same writer's periodical Psychica (Paris), passim.\n\f480 Theodore Besierman [part 111]\nZou taps his answer with his paws. Thus, on being asked\nto multiply six by four, Zou tapped on Mme. Borderieux's\npalm twice with one paw and four times with the other\n(\n= 24). On observing that Zou, though very friendly and\ngood-tempered, refused to tap on any other hand but that\nof Mme. Borderieux, I watched the above-described pro-\ncedure rather more attentively. I soon noticed that Zou\nknew which paw to pat because Mme. Borderieux placed\nher hand nearer that j^aw than the other. He also knew\nhow many times to pat because when he had brought\ndown his paw the necessary number of times, Mme.\nBorderieux made a slight movement of her hand. Zou's\nintellectual abilities are thus restricted to the abihty to\nrecognise the two signals just indicated, a feat not\nbeyond the average capacity of a dog.\nI should like to add that I consider it quite possible to\nmake such signals unconsciously. I have to thank Mme.\nBorderieux for the opportunity of making Zou's acquain-\ntance.\n\fON THE ASSERTED DIFFICULTY OF THE SPIRI-\nTUALISTIC HYPOTHESIS FROM A SCIENTIFIC\nPOINT OF VIEW.i\nBy Sir Oliver Lodge.\nPART I.\nThe interesting communications in Proc. S.P.E., Vol.\nxxxviii, pp. 281-374, by Mr. W. H. Salter and an\nanonymous writer Mr. V., respectively, on the communi-\ncations coming through Mr. V.'s hand and purporting to\nbe inspired by a little-known deceased poetess, Margaret\nVeley, will, I expect, attract attention from several points\nof view. I limit myself to some remarks on a passage\nin Mr. V.'s well-informed and critical paper, p. 366,\nwhich runs as follows :\n\". . . Regarded as a scientific working hypothesis, spiritism does\nnot seem to me to be a very hopeful avenue of investigation.\nThe spirit hypothesis has a delusive appearance of simphcity,\nbut so also had Kepler's hypothesis of guiding angels. And\nhow remote this was from the complex reality of Einstein's\ndescription of gravitation! In fact, if these supernormal\nmental phenomena depend on the whims and caprices of\ndeparted spirits, then I for one despair of ever being able to\ndiscover any law and order in them.\nUndoubtedly there is some difficulty, in our present\nstate of comparative ignorance, about specifying or formu-\nlating the spiritistic hypothesis in any precise and so to\nspeak scientific manner ; for it is an appeal to the activity\nof unknown agents, acting by unknown methods, under\niThis paper was read at a General Meeting of the Society on\nMay 6th, 1929.\n481\n\f482 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nconditions of which we have no experience, and by means\nof which we are unaware. We get into touch, or appear\nto get into touch, with these agencies only when they\nhave affected material objects, for instance someone's brain,\nthereby stimulating muscles so as to produce results which\nappeal to our normal senses.\nBut the admission that we cannot understand how agents\nwork does not justify our denial of the existence of such\nworking. A good deal of modern mathematical physics is\nin the same predicament. We do not really understand\nhow the properties of the ether, or of what it is now the\nfashion to call \" space-time,\" act in producing the material\neffect we call weight or gravitation. We know a good\ndeal about it ; we can specify with precision the law of\n\" weight \" in so far as it imitates the resultant of an\nindejjendent and unscreened attraction of every particle\nfor every other. We can say that the earth acts nearly\nas if its whole mass were concentrated at its centre, that\nthe law of force is different inside and outside, so that it\nchanges abruptly when the surface is penetrated, and that\nthe force attains a peak value at the surface, sloping\ndown differently on the two sides. We can speak of\nthe state of strain or \" potential \" to which the force is\ndue, say that it is continuous across the boundary,\ngive the law of its variation with distance, and so on.\nNewton, in fact, correctly formulated the whole theory of\ngravitation considered as action at a distance, but the\ntrue mechanism of what seems like a condition of strain\nor warp in space brought about by the very existence of\nmatter, was beyond him, just as it is still beyond us.\nIn phiIoso])hic mood, Newton was never satisfied with his\nmode of specification. It merely gave the resultant effect\nof something that simulated the direct attraction of one\nbody for another across apparently empty space ;\nhe had\nto leave the inner meaning of such mysterious action for\nfuture discovery.\nEinstein discai'ded the attraction or force exerted by a\nbody at a distance, and replaced it by a geometry of\nspace which would account for, or at least expi'ess, the\nobserved behaviour in a more intimate and so to speak\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis .483\nless magical manner. When a registering thermometer, with\na steel index, is \" set \" by means of a magnet acting\nthrough the glass, the index is really moved by the\nanalogous but different modification of space (or ether) that\nwe call a magnetic field. An inert body can only be\nperturbed or guided by something in immediate contact\nwith it ; even though the particular modification of that\n\" something,\" which enables it so to act, may be due to\nthe neighbourhood of a distant mass of matter, for reasons\nwhich remain to be explored.\nThe fact that we sometimes have to postulate an un-\nknown agency does not justify our attributing anything\ncapricious to that agency. We are ignorant of how the\ngravitational agent acts, but we know that it acts in\naccordance with law and order, so that the results can be\nduly predicted. Einstein's view (if we may call it\nEinstein's, though in one form or another it must have\nbeen vaguely held by many) is after all not so very dif-\nferent from Kepler's asserted hypothesis. What Kepler\nmeant by \" guiding angels controlling the planets \" (assum-\ning that he used that phrase) I do not loiow ; but I am\nsure he meant nothing capricious. He must have meant\nthat an unknown something guided the planets in their\npath ; and that is a paraphrase of the modern view. The\nsomething is now often spoken of as a warp in space\u2014\n-\nacting as a sort of groove. In so far as Kepler postulated\nsomething in immediate touch with a planet and acting\ndirectly on it, he had what now appears to be truth\non his side ; his thesis being perhaps nearer the ultimate\ntruth, though far less practically useful, than Newton's\ndelightfully simple quantitative expression for the indirect\naction of a distant body.\nIn order to illustrate direct guidance by contact action,\nwe may cite the familiar example of a gramophone needle,\nwhich automatically reproduces a prearranged tune, simply\nby following the path of least resistance. What else,\nafter all, can an inert thing do ? That is the meaning\nof inertia. Animated things are not inert : they need\nnot take the easiest path. A man may climb the Matter-\nhorn for fun. But inanimate unstimulated matter never\n\f484 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nbehaves with any initiative or spontaneity : it is strictly\ninert. Atoms never err or make mistakes, they are\nabsohitely law-abiding. If they make an apparent error,\nif a locomotive engine leaves its track, we call it a\ncatastrophe. All machinery works on that principle ;\nevery portion takes the easiest jDath. It is true that to\nget a coherent result there must have been planning and\nprearrangement. Certainly ! In all cases of automatic\nworking, whether biological or other, that must be an\ninevitable preliminary. But explorers of the mechanism\nwill detect no signs of mental action by their instruments\nor their senses. To infer a determining or controlling\ncause they must philosophise. Indeed, we may go a step\nfurther and emerge from the past into the present :\n\u2014\nA\nwireless set talks like a gramophone, and to one accus-\ntomed only to gramophones it would seem barbarously\nsuperstitious to urge that in the wireless case some (pos-\nsibly whimsical and capricious) operator was actually in\ncontrol. Statements may be unpalatable, and yet be\ntrue.\nNow return to gravitation. Planets behave as if they\nwere attracted by the sun. That is certainly true. But\nwhat is attraction? A train is not attracted to its\ndestination; lightning is not attracted to a chimney ; but\nit gets there none the less, by continually taking the\neasiest path. So it is with a planet. Indeed, one might\nsay that everything inert takes the only path open to it,\nit has no option. The law is a sort of truism. But the\nprinciple, once recognised, has been formulated into a\nclue ; the Principle of Least Action can be expressed\nmathematically. Once postulate that, and the behaviour\nof the inanimate portions of the cosmos can be accurately\ndeduced.\nThe modern statement that the planets move along the\nline of least resistance, or the easiest path, makes their\ncase rather closely analogous to that of a railway train\nguided by the rails. The path and destination of a train\nare determined by the continual direct influence of the\nrails, which make it easier for the train to travel in the\nright direction than to jump them and go astray. We\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic HijiMhesis 485\nmight, if we chose, admit that the j^ath was laid down\nor determined by the mentality of the surveyors and\ndesigners of the route; but a Martian spectator with\npartial information might still wonder at the apparent\nintelligence which guided one part of a train to Man-\nchester, and another part to Liverpool, in accordance with\nthe wishes of the passengers or the labels on the coaches.\nIf told that an invisible guardian angel switched over the\npoints to produce this result, he might resent the sugges-\ntion as absurdly unscientific and preposterous; as on a\npurely mechanistic view it would be.\nAfter having studied trains for some time, our spectator\nmight begin to notice the novelty of a motor-car. His\nfirst tendency would be to look for the rails in that case\nalso ;\nand, finding none, he might superstitiously but\ncorrectly surmise that a guardian spirit was guiding the\ncar to its destination. In this case, moreover, further\nexperience would soon persuade him that he had to allow\nfor an element of caprice. But even that is not fatal to\nthe truth : he need not throw up his hands in despair.\nAs soon as we introduce the activity of life and mind we\nget out of mere mechanism and the results are not easily\nformulated or predicted. The activities of an animal\ncannot be expressed in mathematical terms, and yet\nanimal instincts and behaviour are subject-matter for\nscientific investigation. It is assumed that they obey\nlaws of some kind. Science is not limited to the accurate\ndata and latvs of mathematical physics : and to claim that\na hypothesis is unscientific because we cannot formulate it\ncompletely, or because we do not understand the method\nof working, or even because there is a certain amount of\ncapriciousness about it, is more than we have any right\nto claim. Anthropology and sociology are less advanced\nsciences than physics and chemistry: they have to get on\nas best they can, with a profusion of data, and with the\ninevitable complications appropriate to live things. Let\nus not be put out of our stride by the fear of retaining,\nin modified form, some of the animistic guesses of primi-\ntive man. Experience may lead us, as it led him, to\ncontemplate stranger modes of existence, and more whimsical\n\f486 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nphenomena, than our long study of mechanism has led us\nto expect. We must put aside prejudice, be guided by\nthe evidence, and strive for truth. The superficial simplicity\nof materialism has served us well, as a comprehensive\ncovering, for many centuries, and we have made good\nprogress under its protection ; but it is beginning to get\nthreadbare and inadequate, it is not coextensive with\nreality, and unsuspected influences are peeping through.\nTo sum up. A working hypothesis can be followed up\nand developed rationally without being metrically exact in\nits early stages. The important question about the spiri-\ntistic hypothesis is not whether it is simple or complicated,\neasy or puzzling, attractive or repellent, but whether it is\ntrue. Its truth can only be sustained or demolished by\nthe continued careful critical and cautious method of\nenquiry initiated by the S.P.R. under the Presidency of\na guiding spirit or guardian angel called Henry Sidgwick,\nwith the active (and I believe continuing) co-operation of\nEdmund Gurney and Frederic Myers.\nPART II.\nAnd now, having finished what I have to say in con-\nnexion with Mr. V.'s critical remark in the paper alluded\nto, I propose to develop a theme of my own : first\nasking the reader to consider what the spiritistic hypo-\nthesis really is, and why there should be so much trouble\nabout even provisionally accepting it as a reasonably\nscientific working guide or clue among the maze of phe-\nnomena. I suggest that the trouble is mainly caused by\nour philosophic views. If we are unwilling to admit that\nwe are sj^irits here and now, utilising material bodies which\nwe have automatically constructed for the purpose, then\nprobably any form of spirit hypothesis is unwelcome and\nperhaps meaningless. If we are nothing but material\nmechanism\u2014if a collection of organic molecules, merely\nby reason of their chemical complexity, can develop cer-\ntain functions and reflex actions characteristic of what we\ncall life\u2014if such mechanism can become aware] of itself,\ncan admire, and plan, and acquire a sense of controlling\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 487\nits own actions, if in fact matter constitutes our essential\nexistence\u2014then the hypothesis of an animating spirit may\nwell be considered unscientific and grotesque, and one\nwhich ought to be abolished from the scientific vocabulary.\nBut many philosophers now urge, and I think reason-\nably urge, that materialistic j^hilosophy has broken down,\nand does not cover the whole ground. Materialistic\nmechanism is true as far as it goes, but it is not the\nwhole truth. The attempt to make it the whole truth is a\nnatiu-al outcome of the astonishing success of mathe-\nmatical ph5^sics during the last three centuries. This\npowerful science at first dealt completely with moving\nparticles exerting mechanical forces upon one another\naccording to any prescribed law, then extended itself to\nrigid bodies on the one hand, and perfect fluids on the\nother, and so gradually included elasticity, viscosity, the\ntheory of the conduction of heat, and the molecular\nmovements associated with gaseous and other states,\nincluding all the vibrations responsible for sound. This\nscience, penetrating to the actual forces at work and\nanalysing every detail of their action by a marvellous\nmethod of mathematical deduction, seemed to form a\ncomplete and satisfactory and ideal scheme. It began by\nreducing astronomy to an admirable system of law and\norder; indeed Newton and Laplace seemed to be initiating\nthe last word on the detailed elaboration of the solar\nsystem, and events could be predicted centuries ahead.\nAstronomy seemed approachmg a kind of perfection. The\ncomplacency of nineteenth-century physics was remarkable.\nNaturally an attempt was made to explain all pheno-\nmena m the physical universe in terms of molecular\ninteraction : that was the ideal set before himself by New-\nton, and that ideal has been followed up ever since. So far\nas the inorganic world is concerned we might hardly ex-\npect to dive deeper, for though the explanations really\nleave a good deal of mystery from the philosophic stand-\npoint, it is the kind of mystery to which we have grown\naccustomed in daily life, and usually ignore.\nThe most advanced sciences throughout the nineteenth\ncentury floufished on this basis, and set an [example which\n\f488 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nother sciences tried to follow. The ambition of j^^jsio-\nlogists has been to apply these same laws to organic and\nliving structures, and to work out the behaviour of the\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms on a physico-chemical\nbasis, and no other. Certainly there were experiences\nwhich constantly suggested difficulties, and seemed to\ndemand something more; but it was hoped that these dif-\nficulties were of the kind that could be overcome by\nfurther study, and by a still closer understanding of the\nchemical and physical processes involved. There seemed\nto be nothing in the universe but matter in various forms\nof motion; and by a thorough study of matter and motion\nit was hoped that the whole of nature might be under-\nstood and explained.\nTo quote and abbreviate from Professor Whitehead's\nbook, Science and the Modern World, Chapter IV. :\n\u2014\nThe eighteenth centiuy was the age of reason ;\nhealthy,\nmanly, upstanding reason ;\nbut, of one-eyed reason, deficient\nin its vision of depth. . . . Voltaire was typical of the virtues\nof his century ; he hated injustice, cruelty, repression . . . and\nhe hated hocus-pocus. . . . But if men cannot live on bread\nalone, still less can they do so on disinfectants. So the age\nhad its limitations ;\nyet some of its main positions are still\ndefended in the schools of science. . . . The seventeenth cen-\ntury had provided a perfect instrument for research. The\ntriumph of materialism was chiefly in the sciences of rational\ndynamics, physics, and chemistry. . . . Nothing fundamental\nand new was introduced in the eighteenth century, but there\nwas an immense detailed development. Special case after\nspecial case was unravelled. It was as though the very\nHeavens were being opened, on a set plan. ... In this century\nthe notion of the mechanical explanation of all the processes\nof nature finally hardened into a dogma of science. The\nnotion won through on its merits by reason of an almost\nmiraculous series of triumphs in mathematical physics. Newton's\nPrinci2Ji(i was published in 1687, Lagrange's Mechanique\nAnalytique in 1787, and Clerk Maxwell's Electricity and Mag-\nnetism in 1873. Practically a century between each. Each of\nthese three books introduces new horizons of thought affecting\neverything which comes after them.\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hyjjothesis 489\nFifty years later, however, there has begun a revolt ; a\nrevolt, strange to say, led by the mathematical physicists\nthemselves. It had been perceived that a study of matter\nalone was inadequate, and that the behaviour of even the\nsimplest molecules could not really be understood without\nattention to the properties of the space around them. In\nfact it was found that empty space was endowed with\nphysical properties. Those properties cannot be in-\nvestigated directly : we still have to attend exclusively to\nmatter in all experiments and observations, but the\nmaterial behaviour is found to be secondary and sub-\nordinate to the behaviour of empty space. Newton\nseems to have strongly suspected something of the kind,\nbut at that time he could not make much headway in\nthis api^arently more speculative direction; and his theory\nof matter particles acting on each other by unexplained\nforces at a distance was so satisfactory from the mathe-\nmatical point of view and gave such exactly verifiable\nresults that any further treatment in the philosophical\ndirection seemed unnecessary, and at any rate had to be\npostponed.\nThe revolt against the concentration of attention on\nmatter alone was effectively begun by Faraday during the\nfirst half of the nineteenth century, and has been going\non at intervals ever since. Throughout the whole of his\nmasterful treatment, and so to speak creation, of the\nscience of electricity, Faraday insisted on the subordinate\npart played by material bodies, especially in the pheno-\nmena of electrostatics and the electric field. He pointed\nout that charged conductors were merely the terminals or\nboundary of an electric field, that inside them the field\nwas non-existent, that it ceased at the boundary, and\nextended unbroken throughout apparently empty regions\nbetween the visible and tangible bodies on which alone\nexperiments could be made. Their behaviour was a sign\nor token or consequence of the unknown reality which was\ngoing on in the space between them. The intervening space\nmight indeed be full of insulating material, but might equally\nwell be entirely devoid of matter. Space itself had what he\ncalled a specific inductive cajjacity or dielectric coefficient,\n2 I\n\f490 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nof a nature and value unknown : unknown to this\nday. Space is modified by the presence of matter, but\nits properties are not material properties. The primary\nhappenings occur in vacuo. I gather that Epicurus and\nother ancient atomists were the first to discover and\nemphasise the importance of what they called '\nthe void.'\nMuch the same idea had already been promulgated in\nthe case of light or radiation. Light is not transmitted\nby matter, but by space. Matter plays quite a sub-\nordinate part. Light travels with the greatest ease and sim-\nplicity through the emptiness of space, and is only retarded\nor interfered with by the most transparent matter. All\nmatter contains some trace of opacity ; and by opaque\nmatter light is merely destroyed, and its energy turned into\nheat ; but space is perfectly transparent. The radiation\nwhich reaches iis from the sun and stars has traversed\nmillions of miles of empty space without the slightest\nloss of energy. We only detect it by its effect on\nmatter when it has arrived : it then affects the retina\nof our eyes, our photographic plates, and the surface\nof our skin, setting up the chemical and other changes\nwith which we are all familiar. In particular it operates\non the green parts of plants, and thereby renders possible\nthe whole of vegetation. All that we see in a wooded\nlandscape is due to energy which has arrived through\nempty space, and represents a storage of that energy in\nvisible and tangible form. The energy has as it were\nbecome incarnate in matter. A plant or a tree is an\nincarnation of solar energy ; and the complete understand-\ning of vegetative processes is impossible without taking this\nspace energy into account. Just as a charged body was to\nFaraday the termination of an electric field, so a vegetable\norganism is the termination of a luminiferous field. (One\ncannot say a \" luminous \" field; for space itself is not\nluminous: it only becomes luminous when it encounters\nmatter. It may properly be called luminiferous or light-\nbearing, for it conveys radiation without displaying it.)\nSpace itself is dark. It may be full of what we some-\ntimes call ether tremor, but nothing is exhibited, nothing\nis perceptible, unless a particle of matter is introduced.\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 491\nIt is only matter which appeals to our senses, and it is\nonly material objects that we see.\nThus it is through matter that we become aware of\nthe universe ; but we need not allow ourselves to fall\ninto the blunder of therefore considering that matter\nis its most essential feature, or of confusing a pheno-\nmenon itself with its index and result. That would be\nrather like imagining that the deflection of the needle of\na galvanometer was the essential thing about an electric\ncurrent. It would be confusing the manifestation or\nsign of a thing with the thing itself. The movement\nof a piece of iron may demonstrate the existence of a\nmagnetic field, and the field can be explored and in-\nvestigated by the kind of material motions which it\ncauses, but moving iron is nothing like a magnetic field\n:\nit is only the sign or index of it. We shall never under-\nstand the nature of the field by attending to its demonstra-\ntion alone; and we should merely stultify ourselves if we\nsupposed that we understood magnetism or electricity by\nmerely studying the movements and rearrangements of\nmatter. Yet that is what we are tempted to do when\nwe are studying the behaviour of living organisms. All\nwe can observe is the motion of matter; and we are\nliable to imagine that some of those movements constitute\nlife. They are the sign or manifestation of life : they are\nnot life itself. Movement of particles in a brain are very\ndifferent from '\u2022\nthought.\"\nEssentially the same order of ideas holds even in\ngravitational astronomy. The movement of the planets\ndemonstrates what is going on in empty space ;\nthose\nmovements are the index or sign of the real phenomenon.\nA gravitational field exists between the worlds, and Ave\nshould know nothing of it except for their motions. We\ncan attribute those motions to a mysterious force which\nthey exert one upon another ; but Newton more than\nsuspected, and Einstein has elaborated, the idea that that\nforce is merely a sign or index\u2014some might say a simu-\nlacnmi\u2014of some unknown condition existing in space, and\nthat it is to variations in that space condition that their\nregidated movements are really due. Each particle moves\n\f492 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nfrom instant to instant along the line of least resistance\nor easiest path open to it. It is the space in immediate\ncontact with the particle that guides it ; and though we\nmay truly say that it moves as if it were attracted by a\ndistant body, we know that that is only a mode of expres-\nsion\u2014there is much virtue in an \"if,\"\u2014and that it is the\nstate of the gravitational field in touch with each particle\nwhich controls its motion and thereby demonstrates its\nown existence. Some of what Faraday claimed for an\nelectric field can be extended to a gravitational field also,\nthough there are many important differences.\nTo step from these long-known and comparatively simple\nexamples to the spontaneous movements of a living organ-\nism, say an animal, is a very big step, and not one to be\nundertaken lightly; nor can we treat live things with\nanything like the same satisfaction or fulness of knowledge.\nFor the science of biology is comparatively in its infancy,\nnotwithstanding its immense range and the enormous field\nopen to its classification and investigation. I would,\nhowever, direct attention to the possibility that in so far\nas an organism surpasses mere mechanism, in so far as\nnot all its actions are reflex, in so far as it thinks and\ncontrives and plans, and is guided by anticipations of the\nfuture and memory of the past\u2014instead of being immedi-\nately obedient to present impulse like a planet or a\nmolecule\u2014I suggest that the organism is the index or\ndemonstration of something beyond itself, something which,\nthough it may be said to be incarnate in matter, has its\nmore real and permanent existence in some other region.\nWhatever this animating essence may be, it makes no\ndirect appeal to ovu- senses, and is only displayed or\ndemonstrated by its effect on organised material.\nIn all the cases that I have dealt with it is matter that\nwe observe. The underlying cause or motive power is beyond\nour immediate apprehension, and is a matter of inference.\nWe infer the properties of an electric field from its effect\non what we call charged bodies. We infer and investigate\na magnetic field from the behaviour of iron and other\nsubstances. We try to arrive at what an electric current\nreally is from its various influences on matter. And\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 493\nEinstein is leading us to infer a curious warp or modifica-\ntion of space from the effect it has on the perceptible\nsensuous portions of the universe. So also I would hope\nthat we might gradually infer and investigate the nature\nof an animating spirit from the behaviour of the organism\non which we presume it acts. For that there is some-\nthing more than material mechanism in the universe is\nnow claimed by the leading mathematical physicists them-\nselves ; \u2014a claim which I will presently illustrate by some\nquotations from the writings of that profound mathe-\nmatical physicist Professor Whitehead.\nDeficiency of a purely materialistic view.\nMatter has no initiative. Every particle moves as it is\nimpelled, without plan, aim, or intention, just a thoughtless\ndrift\u2014though the result may be satisfactory or beautiful\nwhen appreciated by an intelligent spectator. It is in-\nstructive to stand on a bridge and contemplate a brawling\nstream flowing below; for one can realise that every\nparticle is accurately obedient to external forces, and that\nthe whole pattern is consistent with the equations which\nmathematicians have laid down and worked out. The\nmental satisfaction in such complete comprehension of an\nintricate mechanical pattern is very thorough, and has an\naesthetic value of its own. To a purely scientific mind\nthis grasp of a problem has partially taken the place of\nthe more superficial enjoyment of light and shade and\ncolour and gleaming brightness and glowing depths, which\nan artist takes delight in and transfers to canvas. The\nabstract point of view, the not inhuman but ultra-human\ncontemplation of the scientific man, strikes deep into the\nprevalent view of the universe. As says Whitehead, in\nScience and the Modern World, page 24 :\n\u2014\nThe particular conception of cosmology with which the\nEuroiDcan intellect has clothed itself in the last three centuries\n. . . presupposes the ultimate fact of an irreducible brute matter,\nor material, spread throughout space in a flux of configurations.\nIn itself such a material is senseless, valueless, purposeless. It\njust does what it does do, following a fixed routine imposed\n\f494 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nby external relations which do not spring from the nature of\nits being. It is this assumption that I call '\nscientific material-\nism.' . . .\nAnd then he goes on to say that the assumption is\nentirely unsuited to the scientific situation at which we\nhave now arrived. It is not wrong, if properly construed. . . .\nIt expresses certam facts to perfection. But when we pass\nbeyond the abstraction, either by more subtle employment of\nour senses, or by the request for meanings and for coherence\nof thoughts, the scheme breaks down at once.\nThe joy of scientific contemplation is not derived\ndirectly from the concrete entities observed, but from the\nway they fit into an abstract scheme. That is well\nenough, but the abstract must not be allowed to scorn or\ndeny the concrete : a thinker should be tolerant and\nopen-minded. \"The intolerant use of abstractions is the\nmajor vice of the intellect.\"\nThere are two methods for the purification of ideas. One\nof them is dispassionate observation by means of the bodily\nsenses.\nThe apparently trivial things all fit in as part of a whole,\nand by faith may be fully appreciated by those who\ngrasp science in no narrow and exclusive spirit, but in\nthe spirit more usually associated with poetry. The\nhuman mind contributes something to the processes of\nnature, and deduces from them a depth of reality not\nsuperficially apparent in the observed concrete facts and\nextending far beyond them.\nThe faith in the order of nature which has made possible\nthe growth of science is a particular example of a deejDer\nfaith. ... To experience this faith is to know that in being\nourselves we are more than ourselves : to know that our\nexperience, dim and fragmentary as it is, yet sounds the\nutmost depths of reality : to know that detached details,\nmerely in order to be themselves, demand that they should\nfind themselves in a system of things : to know that this\nsystem includes the harmony of logical rationality, and the\nharmony of aesthetic achievement : to know that, while the\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 495\nharmony of logic lies upon the universe as an iron necessity,\nthe aesthetic harmony stands before it as a living ideal mould-\ning the general flux in its broken progress towards finer,\nsubtler issues (p. 26).\nWe cannot deduce things mentally without a basis of\nobservation, neither can we generalise from observed facts\nwithout a mental operation. Neither method without the\nother is fruitful, though there have been times when one\nmethod only was emphasised and the other largely\nneglected. Whitehead for instance (page 55) rather\nsurprisingly speaks of\nthe unbridled rationalism of the thought of the later Middle\nAges. By this rationalism I mean the belief that the avenue\nto truth was predominantly through a metaphysical analysis\nof the nature of things. . . . The historical revolt was the\ndefinite abandonment of this method in favour of the study of\nthe empirical facts of antecedents and consequences ... in\nscience it meant the appeal to experiment and the inductive\nmethod' of reasoning.\nBut it is possible to exaggerate in this other direction,\nand by over-emphasising the inert and the mechanical to\nlose the larger view which embraces life and mind and\nthe immaterial processes of organic nature.\nThe scientific philosophy of this age [Harvey's or the\nseventeenth century generally] was dominated by physics. . . .\nThese concepts are very unsuited to biology; and set for it\nan insoluble problem of matter and life and organism, with\nwhich biologists are now wrestling (p. 58).\nThe biological sciences are essentially sciences concerning\norganisms. During the epoch m question, and indeed also at\nthe present moment, the prestige of the more perfect scientific\nform belongs to the physical sciences. Accordingly, biology\napes the manners of physics. It is orthodox to hold, that\nthere is nothing in biology but what is physical mechanism\nunder somewhat complex circumstances (p. 144).\nOne unsolved problem of thought, so far as it derives\nfrom this period, is to be formulated thus : Given configurations\nof matter with locomotion in space as assigned by physical\nlaws, to account for living organisms (p. 58).\n\f496 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nIf this turns out impossible, then living organisms can\nno more be accounted for or explained on purely mech-\nanical principles than can the ether or the properties of\nspace. We may have to explain mechanism in terms of\norganism\u2014not vice versa. Animation seems likely to be\na fundamental thing, not reducible to something else. It\nmay be that animation when properly understood will\nturn out to be of fundamental importance. Already it has\nbegun to invade the physico-chemical field. During the\nlatter half of the nineteenth century many processes\nthought to be due to molecular changes in inert\nmatter were traced to the agency of life, i.e. of minute\ncreatures operating in accordance with biological laws.\nEveryone now knows how the work of Pasteur revolu-\ntionised the theory of fermentation, of putrefaction, and\ndisease generally, by showing that operations which had\nbeen thought to be purely chemical or molecular were\nreally biological and organic. The activity of ultra-minute\norganisms was found responsible for all these phenomena,\nand the notion of organism as more generally representa-\ntive or typical of the processes of nature began to attract\nphilosophic attention.\nThe whole of nature might be likened to an organism\nof which we study the functions. On this view, the vital\nthing is not the structure, but the function. An organism\nguides and controls its own workings ; it operates on and\nuses matter, and in that guidance the secret lies. The\nworking of the whole is analogous to the working of our\nown bodies controlled by an animating principle which\nmay be called soul or spirit. But such terms seem alien\nto present-day science. As says Whitehead, p. 94:\n\u2014\nThe world of science has always remained perfectly satisfied\nwith its peculiar abstractions. They work, and that is suffi-\ncient for it.\nBut, as he goes on.\nThe point before us is that this scientific field of\nthought is, in the twentieth century, too narrow for the\nconcrete facts which are before it for analysis. This is\ntrue even in physics, and is more especially urgent in the\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 497\nbiological sciences. Thus, in order to understand the diffi-\nculties of modern scientific thought and also its reactions on\nthe modern world, we should have in our minds some con-\nception of a wider field of abstraction, a more concrete analysis,\nwhich shall stand nearer to the complete concreteness of our\nintuitive experience. Such an analysis should find in itself a\nniche for the concepts of matter and spirit, as abstractions in\nterms of which much of our physical experience can be inter-\npreted.\nSketch of the spiritistic hypothesis.\nVery well, then, the spiritistic hypothesis in its simplest\nand crudest form is that we are spirits here and now,\noperating on material bodies, being, so to speak, incarnate\nin matter for a time, but that our real existence does\nnot depend on association with matter, although the\nindex and demonstration of our activity does. We\ndemonstrate ourselves to our fellows only by means of\nthe material organisms that we have unconsciously con-\nstructed and utilised for the purpose; hence if the organ-\nism is damaged our manifestation becomes imperfect, and\nif the damage is serious we may have to quit the organism\nand remain normally dissociated from matter. Our\nactivities, on this theory, are supposed to go on as before,\nbut now presumably in space ; and only when we manage\nto re-establish some temporary connexion with matter are\nwe able to make any sign, or supply any demonstration,\nof our continued activity. This is the spiritistic hypo-\nthesis, called into existence to account for a large number\nof otherwise inexplicable facts of observation and experi-\nment, i.e. of concrete experience.\nWithout such demonstration and observation the truth\nmight not have been known ; and such demonstration\nmight have been impossible. For even if some such view\nof our essentially spiritual nature be granted,\u2014as at any\nrate plausibly analogous to the other examples of de-\nmaterialised activity,\u2014the truth might have been, what\nmany religious people seem to think it is, that once we\nhave lost connexion with matter, that loss was irrecover-\nable. People holding this view seem to think either that\n\f498 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nthe dead are asleep, or that they are transported or\ntransmuted into a totally different kind of existence, far\nbeyond mortal ken, from which they can make no sign\nto those still in the flesh. They assume that departed\nspirits have lost interest in those left behind, and are\nwholly absorbed in higher things.\nI say the truth might have been that once the connexion\nwith matter was terminated, it was terminated for good\nand all ; that the consequences of terrestrial action alone\nsurvived ; and that just as the dead were no longer access-\nible, so neither could they be assisted by our thoughts or\nour affection, nor could they have any guiding or helpful\ninfluence on those left behind. So completely do some\ngood peoj)le think of the departed as in a state of passive\nrest, that they might as well be in the grave. There are,\nindeed, some who think that any kind of revival and\nreunion will only be possible when in some extraordinary\nway those mortal bodies are resuscitated. \" On the\nresurrection morning soul and body meet again.\" Those\nphysical instruments seem to them so important that the\nparticles are supposed to be stored until they can be\nagain utilised in some future embodied existence, a mil-\nlennium, perhaps a million years, ahead. This old, almost\nsuperseded, but traditional belief in the resuscitation of\nthe discarded mechanism only serves to show how deep-\nrooted is the tendency to confuse the indicator with the\nphenomenon itself, and to imagine that apart from matter\nexistence is impossible. Whether the physical analogies\nnow adduced are of any use to people cajoable of such\nbeliefs is doubtful ;\nthey know too little about space to\nbe imjiressed ; the popular idea of empty space is sheer\nemptiness and nothing else.\nYet we have learnt that matter is acted on wholly by\nthe influences which reach it from space. Inert matter\nwould never show any sign of activity, nor could it change\nits state of motion if left to itself. The changes that we\nobserve are wholly due to the action of space upon it.\nI want to extend this idea, derived from gravitation,\ncohesion, electricity, magnetism and light, and include the\nless known and yet familiar activity called animation.\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 499\nThat matter can be animated we can most of us admit,\nthough we know not how it is animated, or what the\nprocess of animation is : that space may be animated, too,\nmust be regarded as a new idea. But it is not unreason-\nable ; for just consider :\n\u2014Long ago it would have seemed\nabsurd to say that space had any physical properties, that\nlight was a function of space, that electric, magnetic and\ngravitational fields were demonstrations through matter of\nsomething going on in space, that the very cohesion\nbetween the particles of a solid is due to some entity in\nspace. But to physicists these various properties of space\nare becoming commonplace ; and for myself I venture to\nextend the conception to animation also. I do not\nventure to define spirit, save as the animating principle\non a higher grade. On a lower grade it might be\ncalled sold or mind ; and on a still lower grade merely\nlife, which to me seems the rudiment of mind. But\nwhether we are able to define it or not,, we all Imow in\nsome rough sense what we mean by the term. It is the\nbasis of Descartes' philosophy \" cogito ergo sum.\" What-\never else he knew or did not know, he knew that he\ncould think. And it is that thuaking, idealising, aspiring,\nhoping, loving part of ourselves which I wish to suggest\nby the name of spirit.\nMy doctrine at present is that this transcendental,\nimmaterial entity needs and always will need somethmg\nphysical\u2014physical, not necessarily material\u2014for its mani-\nfestation, that it never is really without a \" body,\" even\nthough it be discarnate. The mechanism of flesh which was\nutilised here was indeed temporary, but that was\nnever its primary mechanism. The primary physical\nmechanism associated with spirit is not gross matter, spirit\ncan only interact with matter under difficulties for a\ntime ; its real permanent existence is in the freedom of\nspace, with an etherial mechanism, whose properties do not\najipeal to the senses, and therefore are at present beyond\nour ken. Our only mode of investigation at present is\nlimited to the occasions when spirit may for a time re-\nestablish communication with matter, in defiance of the\npopular prejudice that such re-establishment is impossible.\n\f500 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nI said that truth might have lain in that direction,\n\u2014\nthe direction of impossibility of communication,\u2014but in\nmy opinion our experience shows that it does not. For\nthose who have studied obscure phenomena know that under\ncertain conditions utilisation of a borrowed existing organism,\nor even apparently the reconstruction of a temporary\nmaterial body, is possible, and that through this singular\nuse of a discarded method of manifestation, demonstration\nof continued existence has become real. Communication\nis not entirely cut off, the dej^arted do not soar entirely\nout of our ken. By special effort and under special con-\nditions connexion with matter can be re-established, and\nthus effects are produced which do appeal even to our bodily\nsense organs. One would not have expected that : but\nwe must be guided by the facts. That the facts point in\nthat direction is obvious. Whether they conclusively prove\nthat deduction,\u2014in the sense that they can be explained\nin no other way,\u2014is what remains for us to enquire into\nand make sure of. If other hypotheses are successful,\nthen by all means let them be tried. Biit to be success-\nful they must meet all the facts ; and to my mind every\nother hypothesis sooner or later breaks down.\nBasing my conclusions on experience, I am absolutely\nconvinced not only of survival but of demonstrated sur-\nvival, demonstrated by occasional interaction with matter\nin such a way as to produce physical results. These\neffects may be accomplished through the loan of other\norganisms, submitted to the temporary control of an alien\nintelligence ; that is the commonest way. Communion\nmay be and apparently is achieved in more directly mental\ntelepathic fashion also. There are doubtless limits to the\npossibility of interaction with matter after our familiar\norganism is left behind; but those limits are what we\nhave to ascertain : we cannot lay them down a priori.\nIt may be that naive experience will lead us nearer to\nthe truth than the most recondite speculations of philo-\nsophy. The truth may not be so complicated as some\nwould have us think. Complications are probably due to\nimperfect knowledge. A simple hypothesis may be quite\nnear the truth, even if we cannot formulate it completely.\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 501\nWe cannot formulate our own activities completely, yet it\nis common enough to adduce the activities of an incarnate\nspirit : for instance, it is considered quite simple to say\nthat some person has brought a message, or that some\nother person has removed an object, or that yet another\nhas obej^ed a request, and done us a service, and given us\na helping hand. These occurrences are familiar enough,\nthough how they are accomplished we should find it hard\nto express in detail. Philosophers puzzle over the simplest\nactions. The utilisation of vibrations of the air for com-\nmunicating ideas is not really a simple process ; it ought\nto be surprising, instead of commonplace. In our daily\nlife we trust to naive experience, and we are not misled.\nWe often do not understand facts, we just grow accus-\ntomed to them. Understanding comes later ; and not to\nall. If the facts indicate communication and continued\nmental activity, then let us not be afraid of accepting\nthem. If we had waited to deal with electrical phenomena\nuntil we understood the nature of an electric field, we\nshould be waiting still. If Newton had declined to con-\nsider gravitational astronomy till he understood the nature\nof a gravitational field, we should still be in the Dark\nAges of science. We have not to wait, before planning\nthings, until we understand the interaction of mind and\nbody.\nThe spiritistic hypothesis, pressed to the full, probably\ninvolves far more than we can in our highest flights\nimagine. It leads us into the region of aesthetics and\ngenius and inspiration and theology. But our ordinary\ndaily life is conducted on lower levels, and for them the\nsimple primitive ideas suffice. Struggling and bereaved\nhumanity seeks to learn something of the fate of its\nloved ones, seeks to be assured that affection continues,\nthat they are not far removed from us, and that reunion\nwill not be postponed to some absurdly distant date. My\nhypothesis is that they are all round about us, in what\nwe call the ether of space rather than in matter; that inter-\ncommunion is still possible ; and that simple souls may\nderive comfort from their intuitive perceptions and naive\nexjieriences, without being deterred by the difficulties which\n\f502 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nsuccessful concentration on material mechanism for the last\ntwo or three centuries seems to raise in their path. After\nall, it is now found that that material mechanism itself con-\ntains more mystery than had been conjectured, and that\nthe full explanation even of it, if ever such explanation is\nforthcoming, will lead, and already is beginning to lead,\ntowards an idealistic view of existence, not at all dis-\nsimilar from the animistic or spiritistic view of the real\nand permanent universe here and now.\nIn brief, we are immortal spirits in temporary associa-\ntion with matter. Probably it is through this bodily re-\nstriction and isolation that we become individualised and\nacquire a permanent personality, which hereafter is able to\nadapt itself to new surroundings, in accordance with the\nwell-studied biological adaj)tability of the rest of animate\nexistence.\nConditions of future existence.\nWhy do people decline to face continued existence of\nthe same general kind as that which corresponds with\nour experience now ? The world as we see it is largely\nour own interpretation. To a different grade of being the\nsame things might have a totally different aspect. Our\napprehension depends on the way we interpret sense\nindications ; and if our interpretative faculty continues, we\nshall be likely to interpret other surroundings in much the\nsame way. The interpretation and even the kind of per-\nception of nature depend a great deal on ourselves ; and\nan interpretative faculty is likely to continue. But hitherto\nscience has declined to contemplate an immaterial\nexistence, and only a few are willing to suppose that it\nmay be hiU of concrete reality in which we can feel at\nhome.\nThis disinclination to face possibilities of a concrete kind\nin another order of existence may be partly due to\ndeference to the science of the seventeenth, eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries, which seldom contemplated concrete\nand commonplace surroundings, and mainly dealt with\nabstractions. It was the poets who faced concrete exist-\nence. Literature as a whole is full of it, for it concerns\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 503\nitself with natural objects in their full display of colour\nand vivacity, as well as with the caprices and behaviour\nand responsible or irresponsible actions of human beings\nin general. Whereas science busies itself with the abstract,\nand mainly prides itself on metrical abstractions of a non-\nhuman character. Even the classifications and generalisa-\ntions of science are abstract. But life does not consist of\nabstractions and generalisations. Life consists of full-\nbodied reality and concrete instances. It finds room both\nfor the dignified and the undignified, the frivolous as well\nas the serious ;\nthimble-rigging and sweepstakes on the\nDerby find a place in it. It is not high and dry at all.\nHumanity can be whimsical and seek odd experiences, and\ncan disport itself, as in novels, in the most unscientific\nmanner. As scientific men we can ignore these eccen-\ntricities, but we cannot eliminate them from nature. The\nworld would be poorer and more prosaic without them.\nPerhaps the next world is not the remotely dignified,\ncontinuously religious place we have been inclined to\nthink. All the gloom and blackness associated with it\n\u2014aye and the blazing brightness\u2014may be inappropriate.\nDeath is solemn undoubtedly ; but so is birth. Entry into\na new state of things cannot but be an important adven-\nture. The world of matter on which we enter at birth\nis wonderful enough, but it has its moments of frivolity ;\nand I see no reason to suppose that any existence in which\nwe share shall seem to us entirely difi^erent in that respect.\nContent of Messages.\nOn the hjqjothesis that we can ever enter into communi-\ncation with those in that order of existence, we ought to\nlearn from them something of what it is like. I consider\nthat we have learnt something, not very much, but suffi-\ncient to carry on with. I do not expect to be much\nsurprised when I get there. So far as it goes, the testi-\nmony is in favour of a still continuing full-bodied existence,\nnot indeed of matter, but of something else, which though\nit does not appeal to our present senses, is otherwise\nequally real, equally substantial ; freer and less hampered\nit seems to be, but not revolutionarily different. We\n\f504 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nappear to remain ourselves, and the conditions around us\nare of somewhat the same order. That at any rate is\nthe testimony, for what it may be worth. And it seems\nto me fairly reasonable that it should be so. Whatever\nit may be that has produced this world, has produced\nthat also ;\nand the mere fact that it is of a kind which\ndoes not appeal to our present animal senses is really no\nargument for its completely different essential character.\nIn so far as we remain ourselves, we might expect other\nthings to remain themselves too, or at least to be capable\nof a somewhat similar interpretation in the light of what-\never faculties we then possess.\nSo fully are we dependent on mental interpretation for\nour detailed apprehension of existence that some have not\nhesitated to hold that the beauties of nature are put into\nit by ourselves, that all its secondary qualities are con-\nstructions of the mind. Whitehead expresses, and seeks to\nexpose, this view on p. 77 :\nThe mind in apprehending [secondary quahties] also experi-\nences sensations which, properly speaking, are qualities of the\nmind alone. . . . Nature gets credit which should in truth be\nreserved for ourselves : the rose for its scent : the nightingale\nfor his song : and the sun for his radiance. The poets are\nentirely mistaken. They should address their lyrics to them-\nselves, and should turn them into odes of self-congratulation\non the excellency of the human mind. Nature is a dull\naffair, soundless, scentless, colourless ;\nmerely the hurrying of\nmaterial, endlessly, meaninglessly. However you disguise it,\nthis is the practical outcome of the characteristic scientific\nphilosophy which closed the seventeenth centmy. ... It has\nheld its own as the guiding princij^le of scientific studies ever\nsince. It is still reigning. ... it is without a rival. And yet\n\u2014it is quite unbelievable. This conception of the universe is\nsurely framed in terms of high abstractions, and the paradox\nonly arises because we have mistaken our abstractions for\nconcrete realities.\nSo says Prof. Whitehead, who complains of modern\nphilosophy thus :\n\u2014\nThe enormous success of the scientific abstractions yiekling\non tlie one hand matter with its simple location in space and\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 505\ntime, and on the other hand ynind, perceiving, suffering,\nreasoning, but not interfering, has foisted on to philosophy\nthe task of accepting them as the most concrete rendering of\nfact. Thereby modern philosophy has been ruined. It has\noscillated in a complex manner between three extremes. There\nare the dualists, who accept matter and mind as on equal\nbasis, and the two varieties of monists, those who put mind\ninside matter, and those who put matter inside mind. All\nthis inherent confusion is due to the ascription of misplaced\nconcreteness to the scientific scheme of the seventeenth century\n(p. 79). .\nI suggest that a unification will never be accomplished\nuntil the ether be taken into accord as a tertium quid.\nAnimated ether is like an organism, and the workings of\nthat organism are what we really observe. Admittedly\nthere are difficulties about the conception of an ether,\nespecially an animated ether, but we must be patient, and\ngive the idea time to soak in :\nThere is a danger in refusing to entertain an idea because\nof its failure to explain one of the most obvious facts in the\nsubject matter in question. If you have had your attention\ndirected to the novelties in thought in your own lifetime, you will\nhave observed that almost all really new ideas have a certain\naspect of foolishness when they are first produced (p. 67).\nMeanwhile we can bethink ourselves that matter itself\nhas an etheric aspect, and it may be that aspect which\nhereafter will appeal to us. The difficulty of apprehend-\ning existence apart from matter is after all a natural\nresult of our limited experience now.\nWe cannot well imagine what an enlarged experience is\nexactly like ; but if the testimony is in favour of some\nsimilarity, there is no a priori reason for rejecting it. In\ndefault of any other clue, \"testimony\" is the source of\ninformation open to us. We may have to treat the\nstatements somewhat like travellers' tales about a new\ncountry. Some of those tales have been incredible\nat first, but have subsequently been proved true. The\nwhole point is whether any trustworthy information is\nforthcoming. Meanwhile a working hypothesis is legiti-\n\f506 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nmate. And that my hypothesis is not altogether repugnant\nto or out of harmony with modern science may be illus-\ntrated by the following passages from Whitehead :\n\u2014\nWe now find a movement in science itself to reorganise its\nconcepts, driven thereto by its own intrinsic development. . . .\nI hold that the ultimate appeal is to naive experience and\nthat is why I lay stress on the evidence of poetry. . . . Some\npeople express themselves as though bodies, brains, and nerves\nwere the only real things in an entirely imaginary world. . . .\nWe have to admit that the body is the organism whose\nstates regulate our cognisance of the world. The unity of\nthe perceptual field therefore must be a unity of bodily\nexperience. In being aware of the bodily experience, we must\nthereby be aware of aspects of the whole spatio-temporal\nworld as mirrored within the bodily life. ... (p. 128).\nOne of our ideas is that of a field of physical activity\npervading all space even where there is an apparent vacuum\n(p. 138).\nSo physical conceptions have greatly changed of late,\nand the explanations in vogue during the nineteenth\ncentury are felt by physicists themselves to be inadequate.\nThe time has come for a more open mind, receptive of\nthings strange and out of accord with ordinary common-\nplace experience.\nThe middle period of the nineteenth centmy was an orgy\nof scientific triumph. Clear-sighted men, of the sort who are\nso clearly wrong, now proclaimed that the secrets of the\nphysical universe were finally disclosed. If only you ignored\neverything which refused to come into line, your powers of\nexplanation were unlimited (p. 142).\nBut now the very terms used by science are in process\nof re-examination :\n\u2014\nEnergy is merely the name for the quantitative aspect of\na structure of happenings ; m short, it depends on the notion\nof the functioning of an organism (p. 144).\nThe various physical laws which appear to apply to the\nbehaviour of atoms are not mutually consistent as at present\nformulated. The appeal to mechanism on behalf of biology\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Sinritualistic Hypothesis 507\nwas in its origin an appeal to the well-attested self-consistent\nphysical concepts as expressmg the basis of all natural pheno-\nmena. But at present there is no such system of concepts.\nScience is taking on a new aspect which is neither purely\nphysical, nor purely biological. It is becoming the study of\norganisms. ... A thoroughgoing evolutionary philosophy is in-\nconsistent with materialism. . . . The emergence of organisms\ndepends on a selective activity which is akin to purpose\n(p. 145).\nThe new situation in the thought of to-day arises from\nthe fact that scientific theory is outruiming common sense. . . .\nThe eighteenth century opened with the quiet confidence that\nat last nonsense had been got rid of. To-day we are at the\no]3posite pole of thought. Heaven knows what seeming non-\nsense may not to-morrow be demonstrated truth (p. 161).\nModern physics is perilously approaching metaphysics,\njust as psychology is perilously approaching metapsychics.\nScientific men of the last century immersed in the splendid\nabstractions of mechanical science and the brilliant elabora-\ntions of mathematical principles\u2014like Professor Tait, for\ninstance\u2014^were apt to be contemptuous of philosophy.\nHe spoke once of a line of argument which must be\nabandoned because it \" led straight to the den of the\nmetaphysician, strewn with the bones of former explorers,\nand abhorred by every true man of science.\" I cannot\nnow find this [inexact] quotation. Tait's British Association\nlecture on \"Force\" in 1876 was unfortunately expurgated\nbefore publication, but I find in that lecture, as reported\nin Nature, Vol. XIV., page 460, the following :\n\u2014\nAs he [a student] gradually gains knowledge by this\u2014the\n07ily\u2014method [observation and experiment and mathematical\ndeductions from data so obtained] he wiU see more and more\nclearly the absolute impotence of all so-called metaphysics, or\na priori reasoning, to help him to a single step in advance.\nHe goes on to emphasise the abundant fruitfuhiess of the\nsenses and reason working together ; either without the\nother being barren ; and he illustrates this point by\nseveral examples. With this we may well agree, without\nnecessarily acquiescing in his apparent dislike of intuition\n2k2\n\f508 Sir Oliver Lodge [PAET\nand innate mental perception. Indeed he himself limits\nhis dictum to the acquisition of knowledge about the\npurely physical world; and that he took no narrow view\nof this is shown by the book for which he was partly\nresponsible, The Unseen Universe. In that book (it may be\nsaid) was begun the heralding of some of those conceptions\nabout the ether which I am working at now.\nDifficnlties in the verification of the spiritistic hypothesis.\nAny hypothesis which aims at becoming a theory ought\nto lead to results and if possible predictions of a verifiable\nkind which can subsequently be tested. The difficulty\nabout the spiritistic hypothesis is that we can only test\nits assertions by observations and experiments on matter.\nOnly in so far as discarnate humanity can still deal with\nmatter can it make any direct appeal to us. Now\nhumanity already possesses a certain power over matter\n;\nand it is solely by their effect upon matter that we are\nnormally aware of other human beings. Hence any\ndisplay of material happenings may have to be hypothetically\nattributed to extended powers of known humanity.\nIt is true that our faculties are not limited to material\nor sensory experiences : we have ideas and intuitions and\naspirations, and can frame conceptions of an immaterial\nkind. Science for the most part ignores these vaguer\npowers of humanity; but poetry and literature do not ;\nthese immaterial things loom large in poetry. They\nconstitute a considerable part of our real experience : and\nin a survey of existence they should by no means be\nignored. To narrow ourselves down to the conceptions\nof metrical science is an undue limitation of our faculties.\nIt would mean a shutting of our mental eyes to perhaps\nthe greater part of our experience. Immaterial concep-\ntions are not abstractions, but are real concrete mental\nexperiences of which we are primarily aware. And it is\na continuation of these experiences that we mean by\nsurvival.\nBut when we talk of verifying survival, we usually\nmean verification by means of a continued action of\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 509\nspiritual entities, even though now discarnate, on the\nmaterial world. It might have been that such action and\nsuch verification were impossible, but there is a good deal\nof testimony in favour of the possibility that under\ncertain conditions we can continue to act on matter.\nThe main difficulty in establishing it is what I hinted\nabove, namely that we are spirits here and now, and\nalready possess some of the faculties that presumably we\nshall possess then ; so that it becomes difficult to dis-\ncriminate between the activity of discarnate personalities\nand those of the incarnate. If an effect is produced on\nmatter, it may be due to some unexplored faculties which\nwe already possess without knowing it. Suppose, for\ninstance, that an object is moved, or some speech or\nwritings produced, in an unfamiliar way. How do we\nknow that we are not doing or producing that movement\nunconsciously, or perhaps fraudulently, ourselves ? How can\nwe verify the assertion that it is accomplished by a dis-\ncarnate entity ? If ultra-mundane agencies could do things\nimpossible to us, that might constitute a proof of their\nexistence. But who is to say what is really impossible to\nus ? And again, Why should their power of acting on\nmatter be superior to our own ?\nThe study of psychical research has led us to perceive\nthe existence of many unexpected faculties. Telepathy is\none of them. What is called clairvoyance is another.\nThe finding of hidden water, or what is called dowsing,\nis a faculty for which there is much evidence. The\nreading of sealed letters is a second branch of the same\nfaculty. The perception of events going on at a great\ndistance is a third. On one view, all these things are\naccomplished by our own supposed extended faculties ;\nunexplained and problematical in execution it is true, and\nthe fact that such things actually occur is one that has\nto be established. But siippose they do occur. It is\nthe fashion to cite them as instance of cryptesthesia,\nsome unknown sensitiveness of the human organism. This\nis a vague and not well-founded hypothesis, but it has\nto be tried : for only when we find it impossible to\nattribute such faculties to our own subconsciousness or\n\f510 8ir Oliver Lodge [part\nenlarged activity need we feel constrained to bring in other\nintelligences and to regard these extended powers of re-\nceptivity as in some way due to the action of intelligent\nentities not normally associated with matter.\nAssertions are made, however, about certain phenomena\nwhich can only with great difficulty be attributed to the\nenlarged powers of living people. Things are moved\nbeyond muscular reach, without magnetism or other methods\nof acting at a distance to which we have grown so accus-\ntomed that we call them \" ordinary.\" Temporarily\nmaterialised organisms or parts of an organism are testified\nto ;\nproduced not slowly as in the customary operations of\nbiology, but quickly, and liable also to rapid demateriali-\nsation. The bringing of an object into a closed room is\nsaid to be an occurrence that really happens ; as if matter\nwere not only porous in scientific doctrinal reahty, but\nabsurdly permeable to ordinary observation. Immunity\nfrom fire, and many other physical phenomena, are taken\nas indications that some intelligences of greater knowledge or\nexperience than our own are operating. In that respect\nwe seem to be like savages beginning to get into occasional\ntouch with a more experienced white race. So various\nphysical phenomena, as well as the materialisation and\ndirect voice and photographic evidence, are appealed to as\ndemonstrations of a power altogether supernormal, and\nfrom the purely mechanistic or materialistic point of view\nsupernatural. These things, if they occur at all, do not\noccur in the ordinary course of nature, the kind of nature\ncontemplated by the Royal Society. Their investigation\nhas only been carried on by Societies formed for that\npurpose. Nevertheless they seem to form the actual experi-\nence of certain individuals. So on the principle that no\nexperience should be overlooked, the growing body of\ntestimony in their favour ought not to be ignored.\nIt may be hard to define the limitations of extended\nhuman faculty ; the objection that we do not know the\nextent of our own faculties is a valid objection. Mean-\nwhile undoubtedly the dramatic semblance of these occur-\nrences strongly suggests outside agencies; and it may be\nthat that suggestion is a true one. We would not have\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spiritualistic Hypothesis 511\nanticipated that discarnate intelKgencies, even if they can\nsend messages, have the power of performing miracles ;\nthat is to say, of producing effects which so far as we\nare concerned would be miracles ; but if they are able to\ndo these things, we should not ignore them as impossible,\nbut take pains to examine and verify them. The first need\nis verification of the phenomena ; consideration of how they\nare accomplished must follow in due time. At least they\nwould form an expansion of psychology ; and the expan-\nsion to which they certainly seem to point is that the\npsychical entity responsible for our daily and commonplace\nactions is not limited to its association with any particular\ntemporary organism, but is capable of sporadic activity\neven when that organism is discarded.\nOn the whole, however, the verification of this hypo-\nthesis, or our willingness to regard it as the beginnings\nof a theory, must depend largely on our philosophic view.\nAttempts are already being made by mathematical physi-\ncists at an enlarged view of existence. A concentration\non matter which served well enough the eighteenth and\nmuch of the nineteenth centmies, is turning out insuffi-\ncient. The abstractions of science clearly do not cover\nthe whole of concrete experience. And the revolt has\nbegun by diverting attention from matter to the properties\nof space, or to the properties of whatever substantial entity\nfills space.\nA plea for a under conception of science.\nThe new philosophic position gradually being attained by\nmodern physicists is of a comj)lex order not easy to put\ninto words. It has a bearing on our conceptions of space\nand time, two abstractions very different from matter, and\nyet effectively very important. It is said that what we\nexperience directly and instantaneously is an \"event,\" a\ntechnical term much used by Einstein, Eddington, and\nother mathematical physicists. Every real entity has what\nis called a \" world line.\" It is not a point in space, it is\na line in time ;\nand an event is typified by the crossing\npoint of two world lines, the event being the interaction\nof one entity with another. But as Professor Whitehead\n\f512 Sir Oliver Lodge [PABT\nurges, an event is not an isolated, self-contained and com-\nplete thing, like the crossing of two lines. It is related to\nand may be the outcome of the past, it is related to and\nmay have consequences in the future. It has a much\nwider significance than a mere point has. An instan-\ntaneous existence has no particular meaning. Every event is\nthe outcome of the past, and has an influence on the\nfuture ; it is a part of a process, a process of becoming.\nIn that respect the universe is like an organism, the\nwhole meaning of which is not given by its instantaneous\nexistence, but must involve memory and anticipation. It\nis part of an evolution, and in its evolutionary significance\nits importance lies. Moreover, an event is related to\nother events in space as well as in time. It has con-\ntemporaries, and apart from them its full meaning is not\napparent. To quote from Whitehead (p. 102) :\n\u2014\nNature is a process of expansive development ... a structure\nof evolving processes. The reality is the process. . . . The\nrealities of nature are the events in nature. Nature is not\na mere assemblage of parts or of ingredients. It is a whole.\nThe events are united both in space and time. Reality\nattaches to the whole complex. Space-time is nothing else\nthan a system of pulling together of assemblages into unities.\n. . . An event has contemporaries. . . . An event has a past.\n. . . An event has a future. . . . These conclusions are essential\nfor any form of realism. For there is in the world for our\ncognisance, memory of the past, immediacy of realisation, and\nindication of things to come. . . .\nHe goes on to say that :\n\u2014\nThe strength of the theory of materialistic mechanism has\nbeen the demand, that no arbitrary breaks be introduced into\nnature, to eke out the collapse of an explanation.\nWhitehead says that he accepts this principle, but that if\nyou start from the immediate facts of our psychological\nexperience, \"as surely an empiricist should begin,\" you\nare at once led to an organic conception of nature.\nIt is the defect of the eighteenth century scientific scheme\nthat it provides none of the elements which compose the\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of SpirituaUstic Hypothesis 513\nimmediate psychological experiences of manliind. It is in\nliterature that the concrete outlook of humanity receives its\nexpression. Yet the most deterministic man of science must\nbe aware of organisms in process of development. A scien-\ntific realism, based on mechanism, is conjoined with an un-\nwavering belief in the world of men and of the higher animals\nas being composed of self-determining organisms. . . . For\ninstance, the enterprise produced by the individualistic energy\nof the European peoples presupposes physical actions directed\nto final causes. But the science which is employed in their\ndevelopment is based on a philosophy which asserts that\nphysical causation is supreme, and which disjoins the physical\ncause from the final end. It is not popular to dwell on the\nabsolute contradiction here involved (pp. 104 and 106).\nWhen we come to ordinary literature Ave find, as we might\nexpect, that the scientific outlook is in general simply ignored.\nSo far as the mass of literature is concerned, science might\nnever have been heard of. Until recently nearly all writers\nhave been soaked in classical and renaissance literature. For\nthe most part, neither philosophy nor science interested them,\nand their minds were trained to ignore it (p. 107).\nBut he goes on to say :\n\u2014\nThere are exceptions to this sweeping statement, especially\nin Wordsworth and Shakespeare. Wordsworth in his whole\nbeing expresses a conscious reaction against the mentality of\nthe eighteenth century. It was not so much intellectual\nantagonism as a moral repulsion. He felt that something\nhad been left out, and that what had been left out comprised\neverything that was most important. Tennyson is the mouth-\npiece of the attempts of the nineteenth century to come to\nterms with science. . . . The problem of mechanism appals\nIiim,\n'\nThe stars, she whispers, blindly run.'\nThus\na dilemma is presented by a thorough-going mechanism. For\nif volition affects the state of the body, then the molecules\nin the body do not blindly run. If volition does not\naffect the state of the body, the mind is still left in its\n\f514 Sir Oliver Lodge [part\nuncomfortable position. . . . Either the molecules blindly run\nor they do not. If they do blindly run, the mental states\nare irrelevant in discussing the bodily actions. . . . The tradi-\ntional way of evading the difficulty\u2014other than the simple\nway of ignoring it\u2014is to have recourse to some form of what\nis now termed '\nvitalism.' This doctrine is really a com-\npromise. It allows a free run to mechanism throughout the\nwhole of inanimate natm-e, and holds that the mechanism is\npartially mitigated within living bodies.\nThis tenet is to me tempting, provided instead of\n\" mitigated \" we read \" supplemented \" ; but Whitehead\nholds that a dualistic theory like that must be an un-\nsatisfactory compromise.\nThe gap between living and dead matter is too vague and\nproblematical to bear the weight of such an arbitrary assump-\ntion (p. 111).\nHe holds that :\n\u2014\nthe whole concept of materialism only applies to very abstract\nentities, the products of logical discernment. [Whereas] The\nconcrete enduring entities are organisms.\nHe means presumably to assert this in every case, ani-\nmated or not. So that the plan of the ivhole influences\nthe character of every subordinate ingredient ; and this\nview of the whole in every one of the parts he proceeds\nto develop.\nNow all this philosophy may seem, perhaps, disjointed\nfrom our main theme. But some philosophy of the kind\nis essential to it. There are two questions about mind.\nFirst, Does mind act on matter at all ? And next. Can\nmind supply for itself any experiences other than those\nprovided for it by the body ? If our philosophy enables\nus to answer these questions in the affirmative, then we\ncan proceed. We are no longer limited to the action of\nincarnate mind. Mental experiences other than those\ngiven by our senses are permissible, and mental actions\non matter need not be limited to those we are accustomed\nto. For getting accustomed to things does not explain\nthem ;\nour own actions on matter are just as mysterious\n\fIll] The Asserted Difficulty of Spirittialistic Hypothesis 515\nas any of those of which we have doubtful testimony.\nAre we spirits here and now, utilising and acting on\nmatter, or are we mere mechanism simulating the functions\nof mind. If the latter is true, as some scientific men\nhold or try to hold, then the greater part of real experi-\nence has to be ignored. Literature and poetry become\nnonsensical. But if we appeal against the abstractions of\nscience to concrete reality as perceived by us, then the\nformer alternative is inevitable, and a great step towards\nsurvival is already taken.\nWe are apt to forget how strange and paradoxical is\nthe view of nature which orthodox science imposes on\nour thoughts.\nWordsworth, to the height of genius, expresses the concrete\nfacts of our apprehension, facts which are distorted in the\nscientific analysis. Is it not possible that the standardised\nconcepts of science are only valid within narrow limitations,\nperhaps too narrow for science itself ? . . . Berkeley, Words-\nworth, Shelley are representative of the intuitive refusal\nseriously to accept the abstract materialism of science. . . .\nPhilosophy is the critic of abstractions. ... It confronts the\nsciences with concrete fact . . .\n(pp. 118, 122).\nCmition.\nIn thus quoting Professor Whitehead, let it not be sup-\nposed that he would agree with my contentions, or that\nhe is in any way responsible for the use to which I have\nput his philosophy. He is a mathematical physicist of\ngreat knowledge and high eminence ; he is able to take a\ncomprehensive survey of existence and of the historical\nprogress of humanity throughout many centuries. He has\nbeen led to his philosophy by a study of existence as a\nwhole, and has been able to combine the most abstract\nscience with the concrete experiences set forth in literature.\nI find in this philosophy some clue, some indication, some\ncorrespondence with the path which I myself pursue. I\nwant to push some of his conclusions further than he\nhimself has yet done. I have no knowledge that he has\never studied the subject which interests psychical investi-\n\f516 Sir Oliver Lodge [part 111\ngators, and it may be that he would resent some of the\ndeductions I draw from his material. I hope not ; but\nI want to emphasise his irresponsibility for any claims or\ncontentions of my own. I regard it as instructive that\none whose studies must have lain at least chiefly in\nmathematical physics should have been led in so idealistic\na direction, and to a philosophy which, though expressed\nin difficult and technical terms, may be utilised by those\nwho like myself have gone beyond the limitations of\nmaterialistic mechanism in other ways and mainly for\nother reasons.\nMy doctrine involves the primary reality of mind in\nassociation with whatever physical mechanism it may find\navailable. Matter constitutes only one of those mechan-\nisms, and indeed only constitutes it in secondary fashion\n;\nand by a study limited to matter alone we shall never\nget the full reality of existence. I hold that all our\nactions on matter here and now are conducted through\nempty space, or rather through the entity which fills\nspace ; and that, if our activity continues, it must be con-\ntinued in the same sort of way and through the same sort\nof etheric mechanism that we already unconsciously utilise\nnow.\nThat in brief terms is the spiritistic hypothesis which\nI proclaim and work on. I cannot but rejoice when a\nphilosophic physicist, full of the higher scientific knowledge\nof our time, has been led in anything like the same\ndirection, without any study of those peculiar and rather\ninexplicable facts on which presumably some part of my\nown philosophy has been founded.\n\fFORMER PRESIDENTS OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARGB.\nPaoB'ESiOR Henry Sidqwiok, - 1882-84.\nI'lioFEssoR Balfour stewabt,\nI'Ml.S., 1885-87.\nProfessor Henry Sidowick, - 1888-92\nThe Earl of Balfour, K.G.\nO.M., F.E..S., . - . . 1893.\nProfessor William James, - - 1894-95.\nSir William Crookes, O.M., F.Il.S., 1896-99.\nFrederic W.
