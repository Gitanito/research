The Metfjods they\ntake in forming \u2022\nthese\nTalismans are\ntoo long to dwell upon here.^ But the\nproperties which they pretend belong\nto them, are, that the jirji Talisman,\nor Seal of the Sun, will make a Man\nbeloved by all Princes and Potentates y\nand cause\nhim to abound with all the\nriches his Heart can rvijlj.

Among others who fell\nunder the Malignity then triumphing, was, John\nEliott the eldest Son of Edward Elliott of Tre-\nberse, Esq; a Stripling of about Sixteen Years of\nAge, but of more than common Parts and Inge\nnuity. At his own particular Request I Preached\nat the Funeral, which happened on the 20th Day of\nJune, i66$. In my Discourse Li mos rei'q; lociq;\npoftulabat) I spake some -Words in Commenda\ntion of the Young Gentleman } such as might en\ndear his Memory to those that knew him, and\ntwithall tended to preserve his example to the Fry\n'\"'\"\" which\n\fOf an A \u00bb P A R I T I 0 N. 2 1\nwhich went to School with him, and were to\ncontinue there after him. An Ancient Gentleman,\nwho was then in the Church, was much affected\nwith the Discourse, and was often heard to repeat\nthe fame evening, one Expression I then used out\nof Virgil.\nEt Tuer ipsefuit cantart dignus.\u2014~\nThe reason why this grave Gentleman was so\nconcerned at the character, was a reflection he\nmade upon a Son of his own, who being about\nthe fame Age, and but a few Months before, not\nunworthy of the like character I gave of the\nYoung Mr. Elliot ; was now by a strange Acci\ndent quite lost as to his Parents hopes, and all ex\npectations of any farther Comfort by him.\nThe Funeral Rites being over, I was no sooner\ncome out of the Church, but I found my self most\ncourteously accosted by this Old Gentleman;\nand with an unusual importunity, almost forced\nagainst my Humour to see his House that Night;\nnor could I have rescued my self from his kind\nness,- had not Mr. Elliot interposed and pleaded\ntitle to me for the whole Day, which ( as he\nsaid) he would resign to no Man. Hereupon I\ngot loose for that time, but was constrained to\nleave a Promise behind me, to wait upon him at\nhis own House the Monday following. This then\nseemed to satisfy, but before Monday came, I\nhad a new Meslageto request me that if it were\npossible I would be there the Sunday. The second\nattempt I resisted, by answering that it was against\nmy convenience,, and the Duty which mine own\niw .-v.\n\"*\n< - < '\nPeople\n\f%% A Remarkable Passage\nPeople expected from me. Yet was not the Gen\ntleman at Rest, for he sent me another Letter the\nSaturday by no means to fail the Monday, and\nso to order my business as to spend with him two\nor three Days at least. I was indeed startled at so\nmuch eagerness, and for many duniungs for a\nVisit, without any Business 5 and began to suspect\nthat there must needs be some design in the Bot\ntom of all this excess of Courtesy. For I had no\nFamiliarity, scarce common Acquaintance with\nthe Gentleman, or his Family j nor could I imagine\nwhence should arise such a flush of Friendship on\nthe sudden.\nOn the Monday I went and paid my promised\nDevoir, and met with Entertainment as free and\nplentiful, as the Invitation was importunate.\nThere also, I found a Neighbouring Minister, who\npretended to call in accidentally, but by the sequel\nI suppose it otherwise. After Dinner this Brother\nof the Goat undertook to show me the gardens,\nwhere as we were Walking, he gave me the first\ndiscovery of what was mainly intended in all\nthis Treat and Complement.\nFirst he began to tell the Infortunity of the Fa\nmily in general, and then gave Instance in the\nYoungest Son. He related what a hopeful spright\nly Lad he lately was, and how Melancholick and\nSottish he was now grown. Then did he with\nmuch Passion lament, that his ill Humour should\nso incredibly subdue his Reason $ for (faith he) the\npoor Boy believes himself to be haunted with\nghosts, and is confident that he meets with an\nEvil Spirit in a certain field about half a Mile\nfrom this Place, as often as he goes that way to\nSchool.\n\fOfan k p fa trOxfo k 23\nSchool. In the midst of our Twattle, the Old\nGentleman and his Lady (as observing their\nCu^\nin exactly) came up to us. Upon their Ap\nproach, and pointing me to the Arbour, the\nParson renews the relation to me, and they ( the\nParents of the Youth) confirmed what he said,\nand added many minute Circumstances, in a long\nnarrative of the whole : In fine they all Three <k>\nsired my thoughts and Advice in the Affair.\nI was not able to collect Thoughts enough on\nthe sudden, to frame a Judgment upon what they\nhad said. Only I answered, that the thing which\nthe Youth reported to them, was strange, yet not\nincredible, and that I knew not then what to think\nor fay of\nit,\nbut\nif\nthe Lad would be free to me\nin talk and trust me with his Counsels,\nI\nhad\nhopes to give them\na\nbetter Account of my Opi\nnion the next day.\nI\nhad no sooner spoken so much, but\nI\nperceived\nmy self in the Springle their Courtship had laid\nfor me\nj\nfor the old Lady was not able to hide her\nimpatience, but her Son must be call'd immedi\nately\n;\nthis\nI\nwas forced to comply with, and con\nsent to, so that drawing off from the Company\nto an Orchard near by, she went her self, and,\nbrought him to me, and left him with. me.\nIt\nwas the main drift of all these Three to per\nswade me, that either the Boy was lazy, and glad\nof any excuse to keep from the school, or that he\nwas in love with some Wench, and ashamed to\nconfess\nit\nj\nor that he had\na\nFetch upon his father\nto get Money and new clothes,, that he might\nrange to London after\na\nBrother he had there\n;\nand\ntherefore they be^g'd of me, to discover the Root\n\f24 A Remarkable Passage\nof the matter; and accordingly to dissuade, ad-\nVise, or reprove him ; but chiefly by all means to\nundeceive him, as to the fancy of Ghosts and Spirits.\nI soon entred a close conference with the\nyouth, and at first was very cautclous not to dis\nplease him, but by smooth words to ingratiate\nmy self and get within him, for I doubted he\nwould be too distrustful, or too reserved. But we\nhad scarce past the first Scituation and began to\nspeak to the Business, before I found, that there\nneeded no Policy to skrew my self into his Heart;\nfor he most openly and with all obliging Can\ndour did aver, that he loved his Book, and desired\nnothing more than to be bred a Scholar ; that he\nhad not the least respect for any of Womankind\nas his Mother gave out; And that the only request\nhe would make to his Parents was, that they\nwould but believe his constant Assertions, con\ncerning the Woman he was disturbed with, in the\nField, called the Higher-Broom- \u00a7lmrtils. He told\nme with all naked freedom and a Flood, of Tcares,\nthat his Friends were unkind and unjust to him,\nneither to believe nor pity him ; and that if any\nMan (making a bow to me) would but goe\nwith him to the Place he might be convine'd that\nthe Thing was real, &c.\nBy this Time he found me apt to compassionate\nhis Condition, and to be attentive to his Relation\nof it j and therefore he went on in this Manner.\nThis Woman which appears to me ( faith he)\nlived a Neighbour here to my Father; and dyed\nabout Eight Years since; her Name Dorothy Ding-\nley, of such a Stature, such Age, and such Com\nplexion. She never speaks to me, but passeth by\nhastily,\n\fOf an A pjp a\"r i t i o n. 25\nhastily, and always leaves the foot Path to me, and\nshe commonly meets me twice or three Times in\nthe breadth of the Field.\nIt was about two Months before I took any\nNotice of\nit,\nand though the Shape of the Face\nwas in my Memory, yet\nI\ncould not recall the\nName of the Person\n;\nbut without more thought-\nfulness,\nI\ndid suppose\nit\nwas some Woman who\nlived thereabout, and had frequent occasion that\nway. Nor did\nI\nimagine any Thing to the con\ntrary, before she began to meet me constantly Mor\nning and Evening, and always in the fame Field,\nand sometimes twice or thrice in the breadth of\nit.\nThe first Time\nI\ntook notice ofher,was about aYear\nsince; and when\nI\nfirst began to suspect and believe\nit\nto be\na\nGhost,\nI\nhad Courage enough not to be\nafraid\n;\nbut kept\nit\nto my Self\na\ngood while, and\nonly wondred very much at it.\nI\ndid often speak\nto\nit,\nbut never had\na\nWord in Answer. Then\nI\nchanged my Way and went to School the under\nHorse Road, and then she always met me in the\nnarrow Lane, between the Quarry Parke and the\nNursery, which was worse.\nAt length\nI\nbegan to be terrified at\nit,\nand prayed\ncontinually, that God would either free me from\nit,\nor let me know the meaning of it. Night and\nDay, sleeping and waking, the Shape was ever\nrunning in my Mind\n;\nand\nI\noften did repeat these\nPlaces of Scripture\n(\nwith that he takes\na\nsmall\nBible out of his Pocket) job. 7. 14. Thou l\nest\nme with 'Dreams, and temfiest me through Vtfi-\nans; and Deut. 28. 67. In the Morning thou jhaU\nfay, Would God\nit\nwere evening, and at Evening\nE\nJ\nthou.\n\f26 A Remarkable Paffage\nthou Jhalt say would God it were Morning, for the\nfear of thine Heart, wherewith thou Jhatt fear,\nand for the fight of thine Eyes which thou Jhalt\nfee. I was very much pleased with the lad's In\ngenuity, in the Application of these pertinent\nScriptures to his Condition, and desired him to\nproceed. (Thus faith he) bydegrco6 I grew very\npensive, insomuch that it was taken Notice of by\nall our family ; whereupon being urged to\nit,\nI\ntold my Brother William of it; and he privately\nacquainted my Father and Mother\n;\nand they kept\nit\nto themselves for some Time.\nThe success of this discovery was only this;\nthey did sometimes laugh at me\n-,\nsometimes chide\nme, but still commanded me to keep my School,\nand put such Fopperies out of my Head.\nI\ndid ac\ncordingly goe to School often, but always met\nthe Woman in the way.\nThis and much more to the fame purpose\n(\nyea\nas much as held\na\nDialogue of near two Hours)\nwas our Conference in the Orchard\n;\nwhich en\nded with my proffer to him, that (without make-\ning any privy to our Intents)\nI\nwould next Mor\nning, walk with him to the Place about Six a\nClock. He was even transported with Joy at the\nmention of\nit,\nand replyed, but will you sure, sir?\nWill you sure, Sir\n?\nThank God, now\nI\nhope\nI\nshall be believed. From this conclusion we reti\nred into the House.\nThe Gentleman, his Wife and Mr. Sam. were\nimpatient to know the Event, insomuch that they\ncame out ofthe Parlour,into the Hall to meet us\n;\nand\nseeing the Lad look chearfully, the first Comple\nments from the Old Man was^ Come Mr. Ruddle,\nyou\n\fOf an\nApparition. 27\nyou have talked with Sam. I hope now he will\nhave more wit; an idle Boy, an idle Boy. At\nthese Words the Lad ran up the Stairs to his Cham\nber without replying; and I soon stop'd the Curi\nosity of the three Expectants, by telling them I\nhad promis'd Silence, and was resolved to be as\ngood as my Word ; but when Things were riper\nthey might know all ; at present, J desired them\nto reft in my faithful promise, that I would doe\nmy utmost in their service, and for the good of\ntheir Son. With this they were silenced, I can- .\nnot say, satisfied.\nThe next Morning before five a Clock, the Lad\nwas in my Chamber, and very brisk; I arose and\nwent with him. The Field he led me too, Iguess'd\nto be twenty Acres, in an open Country, and\nabout three furlongs from any House. We went\ninto the Field, and had not gone above a third\npart, before the Spectrum, in the shape of a Wo\nman, with all the Circumstances he had described\nher tome in the Orchard the Day before, (as much\nas the suddenness of its Appearance, and evanition\nwould permit me to discover) met us and pasted\nby. I was a little surprised at it ; and though I had\ntaken up a firm Resolution to speak to\nit,\nyet\nI\nhad\nnot the power, nor indeed durst\nI\nlook back, yet,\nI\ntook care not to shew any fear to my Pupil and\nGuide, and therefore only telling him, that\nI\nwas\nsatisfied\nin\nthe Truth of his Complaint, we walked\nto the end of the Field, and returned, nor did the\nGhost meets us at that Time above once.\nI\nper\nceived in the young Man\na\nkind of Boldness mixt\nwithAstonifhment; the first caused\nby\nmy preference,\nand the Proof he had given of his own Relation,\nand the other\nby\nthe sight of his persecutor.\nE\n2\nIn\n\f\u00a38 A Remarkahle Passage\nIn short, we went home ; I somewhat puzlcd,\nhe much animated. At our return, the Gentle\nwoman (whose inquisitiveness had missed us)watch'd\nto speak with me, I gave her a convenience, and\ntold her that my Opinion was, that her Son's Com\nplaint was not to be flighted, nor altogether discre\ndited, yet that my Judgement in his cafe was not\nsettled. I gave her Caution moreover, that the\nThing might not take wind, least the whole\nCountry should ring, with what we yet had no\nAssurance of.\nIn this juncture of Time, I had Business, which\nwould admit no delay ; wherefore I went for Lan-\nceston that- Evening, but promised to see them\nagain next Week. Yet I was prevented by an Oc\ncation which pleaded a sufficient excuse. For my\nWife was that Week brought home from a Neigh\nbours House very ill. However my Mind was\nupon the adventure; I studdied the Cafes and\nabout three weeks after went again; resolving by\nthe help of God to see the utmost.\nThe next Morning being the 27 th Day of\n^July 1665. I went to the haunted Field by my\nself, and walked the breadth of it without any en\ncounter, I returned, and took the other walk,\nand then the Spectrum appeared to me, much\nabout the same Place I saw it before when the\nyoung Gentleman was with me : In my Thoughts it\nmoved swifter than the Time before, and about\nten Foot distant from me on my right hand; in\nsomuch that I had not time to speak as I deter\nmined with my self before Hand.\nThe Evening of this Day, the Parents, the Son,\nMd my self, being in the Chamber where I lay ;\n\fOf an A p p a r i t i o k 29\nI propounded to them, our going altogether to\nthe Place next Morning, and some asseveration,\nthat there was no danger in\nit,\nwe all resolved\nupon it. The Morning being come, least we\nshould alarm the Family of Servants, they went\nunder the pretence of seeing\na\nField of Wheat, and\nI\ntook my Horse, and setcht\na\nCompass another\nway, and so met at the Stile we had appointed.\n\"\nThence we all four walked leisurely into the\nquartiles\n;\nand had\u00bbpast above half the Field, before\nthe Ghost made Appearance.\nIt\nthen came over the\nStile just before us, and moved with that swiftness,\nthat\nby\nthe Time we had gone fix or seven Steps\nit\npasted by.\nI\nimmediately tum'd Head and ran after\nit, with the young Man\nby\nmy side j we saw,\nit\npals over the Style at which we cntrcd,but no farther,\nI\nslept upon the Hedge at one Place, he at another\nbut could discern nothing\n;\nwhereas\nI\ndare averr, that\nthe swiftest Horse in England could not have con\nveyed himselfout ofsight,in that short space ofTimc.\nTwo Things\nI\nobserved in this Days Appearance.\nx. That\na\nSpaniel Dog, who followed the\nCompany unregarded, did bark and run away, as\nthe Spectrum passed\nby\n;\nwhence 'tis easy to con\nclude that 'twas not our Fear or Fancy which made\nthe Apparition.\n2. That the motion of the Spectrum was not\ngradatim, or by steps, and moving of the Feet\nj\nbut\na\nkind of gliding as Children upon the ice,\nor\na\nBoat down\na\nswift River, which eventually\nanswers the Descriptions, the Ancients gave of\nthe Motion of their Lemnres, which was,\nYLtt-rzt\n\fgo A Remarkahle Passage\nKa^.' idea digtov $ op a.vQp.TmSi&v.\nHcliodor.\nBut to proceed, this occular Evidence clearly\nconvine'd, but withall strangely affrighted the\nOld Gentleman and his Wife ; who knew this\ncDorothy T>ingly in her Life Time, were at her\nBurial, and now plainly saw her Features in this\npresent Apparition. 1 encourag'd them as well\nas I could; but after this they went no more.\nHowever I was resolved to proceed, and use such\nlawful Means as God hath discovered, and learned\nMen have successfully practised, in these un-vulgar\nCases.\nThe next Morning being Thursday, I went\nout very early by my self, and walked for about\nan Hours space in Meditation and Prayer in the\nField next adjoining to the quartiles.

As I had been\nundutiful to you , and Fortune seemed to\nmake me an Exile, or banished Man, by way\nof Punishment for the Vices of my Youth ;\nso Lapland (which is a Word originally de-\nriv'd from the Finland word Lappi , that\nis,\nExiles\n;\nand from the Swedish word Lap,\nsignifying Banished\n;\nfrom which Two King\ndoms most of our Inhabitants were banish\nd\nhither, for not embracing the Christian Reli\ngion\n;\n)\nwas certainly the properest Country\nin the World to receive me.\nWhen first\nI\nenter'd this Country,\nI\nthought\nI\nwas got into quite another World\n:\nThe Men are all of them Pigmies to our tall,\nbrawny Highlanders\n:\nThey are, generally\nspeaking, not above Three Cubits high\n;\nin\nsomuch that tho' the whole Country of Lap\nland\nis\nimmensely large, and\nI\nhave heard\nit\nreckon\n'd\nby the inhabitants to be above\na\nHundred German Leagues\nin\nLength, and\nFourscore and ten-\nin\nBreadth\n:\nYet\nI\nwas\n'::\ni\nthe\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell ip\nthe tallest Man there , and look'd upon as a\nGiant. The District in which I live now,\nis called XJma Lapmarh You must under\nstand , sir, that when I landed at North\nCape, in Kimi-Lapmark, another District of\nLapland ; there was at that Time a most\nbeautiful Lady come to fee a Sick Relation\nof her Father's, who was prefect, or Governor\nof Uma Lapmark ; which is a Post of great\ndistinction. \u2014This Lady, by being frequently\nin the company of French Merchants, (who\nTraffick now, and then in that Province of\nUma Lapmark) understood French; and ha\nving heard of a Man Six Foot and a half high,\ndesired to fee me ; and when I came, the\nhappen'd mightily to like my Person : And she\ntalk'd French ; which when I anfwer'd, home\nmade great Signs of Joy , that (he could\ncommunicate her Sentiments to me ; and she\ntold me who she was, how rich, and that\nnot one in the company besides could un\nderstand a syllable we said, and so I might\nspeak my mind freely to her. She told me\nthe Customs of the Country ; that it was\ndivided into cantons,' like our Shires, and\nthose cantons into Rckars, or certain Grounds\nallotted ,to families , that are just like our\nclans. As the was beyond measure beautiful,\n(he was extreamly good-humour'd, (a Thing\nrarely to be met with among Lapland Women)\nof better stature than her Country-Women ;\nvery rich , and of good Birth : I thought\nC 2 it\n\fzo The Life and Adventures\nit would be a prodigious Turn of Fortune\nfor a Man in my Circumstances, if I could\nmake any Progress in her Heart ; which slie\nseemed a little to open to me , in such a man\nner, for the beginning, as if such a successful\nEvent, if managed with Prudence, might\nnot be despaired of. Souls that are Gene\nrous, are apt to Love j and Compassion is the\nbest Introducer of Love into a generous Bo\nsom j and that was the best Stock I had to go\nupon in my Courtfliip. I told her of all my\nCalamities, my Dangers, and my Escapes ;\nthe Goodness of my Birth ; as being allied to\none of the greatest Nobles in our Island : And\nstill they would ask me to tell it her over again ,-\ntho' every Time I told it , just at such and\nsuch Paflages, me was forced to drop the\nTears from her Eyes. In fine, I grew more\nin Love with her, out of a Sense of Gratitude\nnow , than by the Power of her Charms be\nfore. The Matter in a few days went so\nfar, that she owned to me I had her Heart.\nAs to Marriage, I did not then know the\nCustom of the Nation : I thought that if it\nproved only dangerous to me, I lov'd her\nfor,\nwell, that\nI\nintended to marry her, tho' the\nLaw was to pronounce me dead for\nit\n;\nbut\nI\ndid not know whether\nit\nmight not be peri\nlous for her too, to engage in such\na\nState\nwith me\n;\nand\nI\nresolved\nin\nthat Case, rather\nto be singly unhappy, than to involve her in\nDistress, and make her the fair Companion\nof\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campb ell \\i\nof my Woes. I would not tell her so, for\nfear she should out of Love hide from me\nthose Dangers ; and therefore using a kind\nSort of Dissimulation, Iconjured her to tell me\nthe Laws and Customs of Marriages in that\nCountry to a Tittle j and that nothing should\nhinder us from Happiness. She told me\nexactly, as I find since. Our Marriage, said\nshe, will be very hard to compass j provi\nded we follow the strict Rule of the Coun\ntry. For our Women here are bound not\nto see the Men who make their Addresses to\nthem, in some Time. His way of Courtship,\nis to come to the Parents ; and his nearest\nFriends and Relations must make her Father\nPresents, and supplicate him like a King, to\ngrant him his Daughter. The Courtship\noften lasts two or three years, and sometimes\nhas not its effect at last : But if it has ,\n'\nthe\nWoman is dragged by her Father and Bro\nther to Church, as unwilling to go to be mar\nried ,\u2022 which is looked upon as a greater Part\nof Modesty in her, according to the greater\nDisinclination she shews. My Father and\nBrother, said she, will both be against it : You\nhave no Relations in this Country to .move\nyour Suit : I cannot be so hypocritical, as to\nbe dragged unwillingly to him I own I de\nsire for my Lawful Husband ; and therefore,\nas I have an Inclination to you , and I dare\nown I have, I will not follow those methods\nwhich I disapprove. I have talked with se*\nC 3\nveral\n\fnM The Life and Adyenturis\nveral Swedes, and several Polite Frenchmen,\nabout their Manner of Espousals ; and I am\ntold, that when Souls are naturally united\nby Affection, the Couple so mutually and\nreciprocally loving, (ho' they had rather\nhave their Parents Leave,\n(if\nlikely to be got)\nyet unwilling to\nbe\ndisappointed, only go to\nthe next Minister's, and marry for better for\nworse. This way\nI\napprove\nof\n;\nfor where\ntwo Persons naturally love each other, the rest\nis\nnothing but\na\nmodefl: Restraint to their\nWiflies\n':\nAnd since 'tis only Custom, my own\nReason teaches me,. there\nis\nno Error com\nmitted, nor any Harm done\nin\nbreaking\nthro'\nit,\nupon\nso\ncommendable an Occasion.\nI\nhave, added she.\na\nThousand Rain-Deer be\nlonging to me, beyond my Father's Power\nof\ntaking away\n;\nand\na\nThird Share\nin\na\nRe-\nkar, or Clan, that\nis\nTen Leagues in Com\npass,\nin\nthe Byar or Canton of Una Lap-\nmark.

You must judge, (my dear\nFather) I must be touch'd with a Woman\nthat was exceeding beautiful beyond any of\nher Nation, and who had Thoughts as beau\ntiful as her Person : I therefore was all in\nRapture, and longd for Matrimony j but\nstill loved her enough to propose the Questi\non I resolved to her ; viz,.

I a\nsaid slie, answerable to my Father for no\nthing, by our Laws ; having no Portion of\nhim, but only what was presented me by\nmy Relations, at my Birth, according to\ncustom, in Lands and Rain-Deer.

I therefore indulged my wife\nin this her Request, and went with her to the\nCeremony : The Star appeared above the\nMoon , which prognosticates a Boy , which\nI wish may, and I scarce doubt will prove\ntrue ; and when she is brought to Bed, I\nwill send you word of it. It is remarkable\nlikewise, that a Star was seen just before the\nMoon, which we also count a very good\nOmen. For it is a Custom likewise here in\nLapland, to consult the Moon as an Oracle,\nabout the Health and Vigor of the Child. ,\nIf a Star be seen just before the Moon, we\ncount it a Sign of a lusty and well-grown\nChild, without blemish ; if a Star comes just\nafter, we reckon it a Token, that the Child\nwill have some defect or Deformity, or die\nsoon after it is born.\nHaving thus told you the Manners of the\nCountry I live in at present, as much at large\nas the Space of a Letter will permit, and rela\nted to you my own happy Circumstances, and\nthe kindly Promises of the Heavens, that are\nushering in the Birth of my Child ; I\nwould not have you think that I addict my\n' \"'\nself\nJ\n-\n\fx6.

The Child\nshe has brought me proves a Boy , and as\nfine a one as ever I beheld ; if Fondness for\nmy own makes me not blind. And sure it\ncan't be Fondness, because other plain Cir\ncumstances join'd at his Birth, to prove it a\nmore than ordinary remarkable one. He\nwas born with a Cawl upon his Head ; which\nwe count one of the luckiest Signs that can\nbe in Nature : He had likewise Three Teeth\nready cut thro' the Gums ; and we reckon\nthat an undeniable Testimony and Promise,\ngiven to the world by Nature, that she in\ntends such a Person for her extraordinary Fa\nvourite, and that he is born for great things ;\nwhich I daily beg of Heaven may come to\npass. *\nSince I have known for some Months\nwhat it is to be a Father, it adds a con\nsiderable Weight to those affections which\nI had for my Wife. I thought that my\nTenderness for her was at the Heighth of\nperfection before ,\u2022 which shews how little\nwe know^ of those parts of Nature , that\nwe have yet never tried, and of which\nwe have not yet been allotted our Share to\nact\n\fof Mr. DuncanCampbeli. 29\nact upon the Stage of Life.

His particular inclination\nto do her good offices* made him recollect,\nthat at the Time he was at Oxford, he. had\nbeen\nin\nCompany with one Dr. Wallis,\na\nman\nfamous for Learning\n;\nwho Jud told him*\nthat he had taught\na\nbdrn Deaf and Dumb\nMan to Write and to Read\n,\nand even to\nutter some sounds articulately with his\nMouth\n;\nand that he told him,- he was then\ngoing to commit to print, the Method he\nmade use\nof,\nin\nso\nInstructing that Person*\nthat others,\nin\nthe like unfortunate condition,\nD\nmight\n\/\n\f34 The Life and Adventures ,\nmight receive the same Benefits and Advan\ntages from other Masters, which his Deaf\nand Dumb Pupil had received from him. A\nDumb Man recovering his Speech , or a\nBlind Man gaining his Sight, or a Deaf one\ngetting his Hearing, could not be more over\njoyed, than Mrs. Campbell was at these un\nexpected Tidings ; and she wept for Glad\nness, when he told it. The good Gentle\nman animated and encouraged her with\nthe kindest Promises ; and, to keep alive her\nHopes, assured her he would send to one of\nthe Chief Booksellers in London, to enquire\nafter the Book ; ( who would certainly pro\ncure it him, if it was to be got ; ) and that\nafterwards he would peruse it diligently,\nmake himself Master of Dr. Wallis's Method ;\nand tho' he had many great Works upon his\nHands at that Time, he would steal from his\nother Studies Leisure enough to compleat so\nCharitable an Office, as teaching the Dumb\nand Deaf to Read and to Write, and give\nher Son, (who was by Nature deprived of\nthem ) the advantages of Speech , as far\nas Art would permit that Natural defect\nto be supplied by her powerful Interposi\ntion.\nWhen the Mother came Home, the Child\n(who could hear no knocking, and therefore\nit must be by a strange and inexplicable In\nstinct in Nature J was the first that ran to\nthe Door j and falling in a great Fit of Laugh-\nter,\n\fof Mr. Duncan Ca mpbeli. }s\nter, (a Thing it was not much used to before,\nhaving on the contrary rather a melancholy\nCast of Complexion ; ) it clung round its\nMother's knees, inceilantly embracing and\nkissing them ; as if just at that Time it had\nan insight into what the Mother had been\ndoing for it, and into, its own approaching\nRelief from its misery.\nWhen the Mother came with the Child in\nher Hand to the Father , to tell him the wel\ncome News ; the Child burst afresh into a\ngreat Et of Laughter, which continued for\nan unusual space of time -; and the Scene of\nsuch reciprocal affection and Joy between a\nWife and her own Husband , on so signal an\nOccasion, is a Thing easier to be felt by Pa\nrents of a good disposition, (imagining them\nselves under the fame Circumstance, with Re\ngard to a Child they loved with FondneG)\nthan to be expresi'd, or described by the Pen\nof any Writer. But it is certain , whenever\nthey spoke of this Affair, (as any body, who\nknows the Impatience of parents for the\nWelfare of an only child, may guess they\nmust be often times it over, and wish\ning the Time was come jj the Boy, who used\nseldom so much as to (mile at other times,\nand who could never hear the greatest Noise\nthat could be made , would constantly look\nwishfully in their faces, and laugh immode\nrately ; which is a plain indication, that'\nthere was then a wonderful instinct in Na-\nD x tvtij\n4\n\u25a0\n\f3*<s\nThe~Lni and Adventures\nture, as I said before ; which made him fore\ntaste his good Fortune, and, if I may be al\nlowed the expression, The Dawnings as it\nwere of the Second Sight, were then preg\nnant within him. X\nTo confirm this, the happy Hour of his\nDeliverance being come, and the Doctor\nhaving procur'd Dr. WaMcs Book, came with\ngreat Joy, and desir'd to fee his Pupil. Scarce\nwere the Words out of his Mouth, when the\nChild happen'd to come into the Room, and\nrunning towards the Doctor, fell on his Knees,\nkilled his Hand eagerly, and laughed as be\nfore ; which to me is a Demonstration, that\nhe had an insight into the Good which the\ndoctor intended him. . \u00bb\nIt is certain, that several Learned Men,\nwho have written concerning the SecondSigbty\nhave demonstrated by uncontestable Proofs,\nand undeniable Arguments, That Children,\nnay, even Horses and Cows, see the Second\nSight, as well as Men and Women advanced\nin Years : But of this I shall discourse at large\nin its proper Place ; having allotted a whole\nfuture Chapter for that fame subject of Se-\ncond-sightedness.\nr\nIn about Half a Year, the doctor taught\nhis little Dumb Pupil, First, to know his\nletters ; then to name any Thing whatsoever ;\nto leave off some Savage Motions, which he\nhad taken of his own accord , before to fig\nnify his Mind by, and to impart his\nJ- -- - u Thoughts\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell. 37\nThoughts by his Fingers and his Pen, in a\nManner as intelligible, and almost as swift\nthro' the Eyes, as that is of conveying our\nIdeas to one another by our Voices, thro' the\nConduitrand Port-holes of theEars. But in\nlittle more than Two Years, he could write\nand read as well as any body. Because a\ngreat many People cannot conceive this, and\nothers pretend it is not to be done in Nature ,\nI will a little discourse upon Dr. Watiiss Foun\ndation, and shew in a Manner obvious to the\nmost ignorant, how this hitherto mysterious\nHelp may be easily administred to the Deaf\nand the Dumb ; which shall be the subject of\nthe ensuing chapter.\nBut I cannot conclude this, without telling\nthe handsome saying, with which this Child,\n( when not quite Six Years old ) as soon as he\nthought he could express himself well, paid his\nfirst Acknowledgment to his Master j and\nwhich promised how great his future Genius\nwas to be, when so witty a Child ripen 'd into\nMan. The Words he wrote to him were\nthese ,\u2022 only alter'jd into EngUJhx from the Scots\ndialect,.\nSir, It is no little Work you have accom\nplished : My Thanks are too poor an Amends :\nThe World, Sir, shall give you Thanks ; for\nas Icould not have express d my self without\nyour teaching me, so those that can talk,\ntho they have Eyes, cannot feel the Things\nD 3\nwhich\n\f38\nThe LifE and Adtixturis\nvbkh I can see, and (ball tell them ; so that,\nin doing me this, you have done a General\nService to Mankind.\nChap. III.\nThe Method of Teaching Deaf and Dumb\nPersons to Write, Read , and understand\na Language.\nIT\nis, I must confess, in some Measure\namazing to me, that Men (of any mo\nderate share of Learning) mould not natu\nrally conceive of themselves a plain Reason\nfor this art, and know how to account for\nthe Practibility of it , the Moment they\nhear the Proposition advanced ; the Reasons\nfor it are so obvious to the very first con\nsideration we can make about it. It will\nbe likewise as amazing to me, that the most\nignorant should not conceive\nit,\nafter\nso\nplain\na\nReason\nis\ngiven them for it, as\nI\nam now\ngoing to set down.\nTo begin\n:\nHow are Children at first\ntaught\na\nlanguage that can hear\n?\nAre they\nnot taught by Sounds\n?\nAnd what are thole\nSounds, but Tokens and Signs to the Ear,\nimporting and signifying such and such a\nthing\n?\nIf\nthen there can be signs made\nto the eye, agreed\nby\nthe Party teach\ning\n\f\f\fos Mr. Duncan Campbell, 39\ning the Child, that they signify such and such\na Thing ; will not the Eye of the Child con\nvey them to the Mind, as well as the ear ?\nThey are indeed different Marks to different\nsenses ; but both the one and the other do\nequally signify the fame Things or Notions,\naccording to the Will of the Teacher, and\nconsequently, must have an equal effect with\nthe Person who is to be instructed : For tho'\nthe Manners signifying are different, the\nThings signified are the fame.\nFor Example : If, after having invented an\nAlphabet upon the Fingers, a Master always\nkeeps Company with a Deaf Child, and\nteaches it to call for whatsoever it wants, by\nsuch Motions of the Fingers, which ifput down\nby Letters, (according to each invented Mo\ntion of each Finger) would form in Writing\na Word of a Thing, which it wanted ; might\nnot he, by these regular Motions, teach its\nEye the fame Notions of Things, as Sounds\ndo to the Ears of Children that hear ? The\nManner of Teaching the Alphabet by Fin\ngers, is plainly described in this Plate.\nWhen the Deaf Child has learn'd by these\nMotions a good Stock of Words ; as Chil\ndren that hear, first learn by Sounds ; we\nmay methinks call (not improperly) the Fin\ngers of such a dumb Infant its mouth, and\nthe Eye of such a deaf Child its Ear. When\nhe has learn'd thus far, he must be taughfNto\nD^ Write\n\/\n.-\u25a0\n\f40 The Life and Adventures\nwrite the Jlphabet,zccord'mg as it was adapt\ned to the Motions of his Fingers. As for In\nstance, the Five Vowels, a, e, i, o, u, by\npointing to the Top of the Five Fingers ; and\nthe other Letters, b, c, d, &c. by an other\nPlace or Posture of a Finger, as in the Plate\nis represented ; or otherwise, as mall be\nagreed upon. When this is done, the Marks\nB, R, E, A, D, (and so of all other Words)\ncorresponding with fore finger, conveys\nthro' his Eyes unto his Head the fame Noti\non, viz. the Thing signified , as the Sound\nwe give to those same Letters, making the\nWord bread do into our Heads thro' the\nEars.\nThis once done, he may be easily taught\nto understand the Parts of Speech ; ss the\nverb, the Noun, Pronoun, &c. And so by\nRules of Grammar and Syntax, to compound\nideas, and connect his Words into a Lan\nguage. The Method of which, since it is\nplainly set forth in Dr. Walfe's Letter to\nMr. Beverly, I shall set it down by way of\nextract ; that People in the same Circum\nstances with the Person we treat of, and of\nthe like Genius, may not have their Talents\nJost for want of the like Assistance.\nWhen once a Deaf Person has learned so far,\nas to understand the common Discourse of\nothers, and to express his Mind (tolerably\nwell) in Writing ; I fee no Room to doubt, but\nthat (provided Natu\/e l*as endow'd him with\na pro\n\fOf 31r.-DUNCANCAMPBELLi \\\\\na proper Strength of Genius, as other Men\nthat hear) he may become capable (upon\nfarther Improvement) of such farther Know\nledge as is attainable by Reading. For I\nmust here join with the Learned Doctor\nWallis, in affecting, as to the present Cafe\nbefore us.) that no Reason can be assigned,\nwhy such a Deaf Person may not attain the\nunderstanding of a Language as pcrfeBly as\nthose that hear ; and with the seme Learned\nauthor, I take upon me to lay down this\nProposition as certain, that allowing the\n, Deaf Person the like Time and Exercise, as\nto other Men is requisite in order to attain\nthe perfection of a Language, and the Ele\ngance of\nit,\nhe may understand as well, and\nWrite as good Language as other Men\n;\nand\nabating only what doth depend upon Sound,\nas Tones, Cadencies, and such Punctilio's,\nno whit inferior to what he may attain to,\nif\nhe had his hearing as others have.\nAn ExtraS from Dr. Wallis, concerning the\nMethod\nof\nTeaching the Deaf and Dumb\nto Read.\nITis\nmost natural (as Children learn the\nNames of Things) to furnish him (by\ndegrees) with\na\nNomendator, containing\na\nCompetent Number of Names of Things\ncommon and obvious to the Eye (that you\nmay shew the Thing answering to such\na\nName)\n\f4% The Life and Adventures\nName) and these digested under convenient\nTitles j and placed under them, in such con\nvenient order fin several Columns, or other\norderly Situation in the paper as (by their\nPosition) best to express to the Eye, their\nRelation or Respect to one another.

At\nfirst\n\fof Mr. dun ca. $ Campbell. 6$\nfirst indeed he would try, when the Child\nforetold him his ill Fortune, whether it would\nprove true ; and relying upon the mere Hazard\nand Turn of the Dye, he had always (as he\nObserved) a Run of\nill\nLuck on those torbidr,\nden Days, as he never fail\nd\nof Good,\nif\nhe\nchose the fortunate Hours directed by the\nBoy.

For many Persons are very\nwilling to ask such questions as the foregoing\nones ; but few or none willing to have the\nPublick told they ask'd them ; tho' they suc\nceeded in their wish, and were amply satisfy 'd\nin their Curiosity. I have represented them\nperhaps in a ludicrous manner ; because tho'\nthey are mysterious actions, they are still the\nActions of a Boy ; and as the Rewards he re-\nceiv'd for his Advices did really and truly\nconsist of such Toys as I mention'd, so could\nthey not be treated of in a more serious man\nner, without the Author's incurring a Magi\nsterial Air of Pedantry, and shewing a Mind,\nas it were, of being mighty grave and senten\ntious about Trifles.

How docs he do it i Does he\nwrite ?\n;\n.'\nDuncan Campbell. No, he writes sometime x,\nbut oftner bespeaks with his fingers, and migh\nty Swift : No Man can do itso quick, or write half\nso soon. He has a little Bell in his Hand, like\nthat which my Mother makes me a Sign tojhake,\nwhen (be wants the Servants ; with that he tie\nkles my Brainfirangely, and gives me an incredi\nble Delight of Feeling in their) fide ofmy Head;\nhe usually wakes me with it in theMorning,when\nhe comes to make me an Appointment. I fancy,\n'tis what you call Hearing , which makes me\nmighty desirous Icould hear in your way ; 'Tis\nsweeter to the Feeling, methinks, tha.nanyThing\nis to the taste : It isju\/l as\nif my Head was tic\nkled to death, as my Nurse used to tickle my Sides ;\nbut 'tis a different feeling, for it makes Things\nlike little Strings, tremble in my Temples, and\nbehind my Ears. Now I remember, I will tell\nyou what 'tis like, that makes me believe tis\nlike your Hearing, and that strange thing,\nwhich you, that can speak, call Sound or Noise :\nBecause, when I was at Church with my Mo\nther, who told me the Bells could be heard ring\ning a Mile off ; as Iwas kneeling on the bench,\nand leaning over the top ofthe Pew, and gnaw\ning the Board ; every time the man pull d the\nRope, I thought all my Head beat, as. if it\nwould come to pieces ; but jet it pleased me,\n''\u2022'\u25a0\u2022'\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0\" '.'.''. methought,\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell! 73\ntnethought, rather than pairid me, and I would\nbe always gnawing the Board, when the Man\nfull'd the Rope, and I told my Mother the Rea\nson : The feeling of that was something like the\nlittle Bell, but only that made my Head throb\nas if it would break, and this tickles me and\nmakes, as it were, little strings on the back\nof my ears dance and tremble like any Thing ;\nis not that like your way of Hearing ? \u2014\nIfit\nbe, it is a sweet thing to hear. \u2014 It is more\npleasant than to see the finest Colours in the\nWorld. \u2014 Jt\nis,\nsomething like being tickled\nin\nthe Nose with a Feather till one Sneezes, or\nlike the feeling, after one strikes the Lee, when\nit\nhas been numb ,or asleep\n;\nonly, with this dif\nference, that those Two Ways give\na\nRain and\nthe other\na\nPleasure\n;\nI\nremember too, when\nI\nhad a great Cold for about Two months,\nI\nhad a feeling something like it, but that was\nblunt, dull, confused and troublesome.\nIs\nnot\nthis like what you call Hearing\n>\nMy Question.\nIt\nis\nthe finest kind of hear\ning, my Dear,\nit\nis\nwhat we call Mustek.\nBut what sort of\na\nBoy\nis\nthat, that meets\nyou\n?\nAnd what fort of\na\nlamb\n?\nDuncan Campbell. Oh\n!\ntho' they are like\nother Boys and other lambs which you fee,\nthey are\na\nThousand Times prettier and finer\n;\nyou never saw such a Boy nor such\na\nLamb\nin your Life-time.\n-.\nMy Question.

He is a little pretty\nBoy, about as tall as my Knee, his Face is as\nwhite as snow, and so are his little Hands ;\nhis Cheeks are as red as a Cherry, and so are his\nLips ; and, when he breathes, it makes the Air\nmore perfumed than my mother's sweet Bags\nthat she puts among the Linnen ; he has got a\nCrown of Roses, cowslips, and other flowers\nupon his Head, such as the Maids gather in\nMay ; his hair is like fine Silver Threads,\nand shine like the Beams of the Sun ; he wears\na loose veil down to his Feet, that is as Blue\nas the sky in a clear Day, and embrroider'd\nwith Spangles, that look like the brightest Stars\nin the Night ; he carries a Silver Bell in one\nHand, and a Book and Pencil in the other ;\nand he and the little Lamb will dance and\nleap about me in a Ring as high as my Head;\nthe Lamb has got a little Stiver Collar -with\nnine little Bells upon it ; and every little\npiece of Woo co upon its Back, that is as white\nas Milk, is tied up all round it in puffs like a\nlittle Misses Hair, with Ribbands of all Co\nlours ; and round its Head too are little Roses\nand Violets fuck very thick into the Wool that\ngrows upon its Forehead, and behind and be\ntween its Ears in the Shape of a Diadem.\nThey first meet me dancing thus j and after\nthey have dancdsome time,the Little Boy writes\ndown wonderful Things in his book, which I\nwrite down in mine ; then they dance againy\ntill he rings his Bell, and then they are gone\n'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2022\nalt\n\fof Mr.Dvscxs Campbell. 7$\nall of a sudden Iknote not where ; but Ifeel\nthe Ticklir.fr in the hif.de lny Head, caus d hf\nthe Bell, less and less, till Idon't fee! it at all ;\nand then Igo home, read over my Left :n m?\nBook, and when I. have it by heart, Iburn the\nwritten Leaves, according as the little Boy\nbids me, or he would let me have no more.\nBut I hear the little Bell again ; the little boy\nis angry with me ; be pull d me Twice by the\nEar, and I would not displease him for any\nThing ; so Imuft get up, and go immediately^\nto the Joy and Delight of my Life.\nI told him he might, if he would promise\nme to tell me more another Time : He said\nhe would, if I would keep it secret. I told\nhim I would ; and so we parted : Tho' quit\nbefore he went, he said he smelt some Venison,\nand he was sure they would shortly have\nsome for Dinner : And nothing was be fore,\nas that my Man had my Orders to bring a Side\nof Venison to me the next Day to Mrs. Camp,\nbell's ; for I had been Hunting, and came hi\nther from the Death of a Deer that Morning ;\nand intended, as usual, to make a Stay them\nfor Two or Three Days.\nThere are, I know, many Men of severe\nPrinciples, and who are more strict, Grave\nand formal, in their Manner of Thinking,\nthan they are Wife ,\u2022 who will be apt to judge\nof these Relations, as Things merely Fabulous\nand Chimerical, and, not contented with be\ning Disbelievers by themselves , will Ja-\n\u25a0\n; <\"\nbour\n\fj6 The Life and Adventures\nbour to insinuate into others this pernicious\nNotion, that it is a Sign of Infirmity and\nWeakness in the Head, to yield them Credit.\nBut tho'I could easily argue these Sir Gravities\ndown ; tho' a Sentence or Two would do\ntheir business , put them beyond the Power\nof replying, and strike them dumb ; yet do\nI think it not worth my while : Their greatest\nand most wonted objection against these Eu-\nd\u0153mons and Caeod\u0153mons, being, that it arises all\nfrom the Work of Fancy, in Persons of a me-\nlancholick Blood. If we consider the Nature\nof this Child's Dialogue with me, will it not\nbe more whimsically strange and miraculous,\nto fay, that a Child of Nine Years old had\nonly a Fancy of such Things as these, of which\nit had never heard any body give an Account, .\nand that it could by the mere Strength of Ima\ngination predict such Things as really after\ncame to pass j than it is (when it does so\nstrangely predict Things) to believe the Child\ndoes it, in the Manner it self owns it does ;\nwhich is by the Intervention of a good D\u0153mony\nor a happy Genius\n.<?\nDeparting therefore from\nthese singular wife Mens Opinions, who will\nbelieve nothing Excellent can happen to o-\nthers, which\nit\nhas not been their Lot to en\njoy\na\nShare of\n;\nI\nshall take my Farewel hasti\nly\nof them (without losing my own Time,\nor theirs)\nin\nthe Words of the Ingenious and\nLearned Monsieur Le Clerc\n:\nAcerhos hotnines\nnon inarorf Indignos quippe, qui h$c Studio\ntrafienty\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell' 77\ntra&ent., aut quorum Judicij ulla ratio Dec\natur.\nI shall rather Tee how far these Things have\nlain open to the Eyes of, and been explain'd\nby the Ancient Sages : I will relate who\namong them were happy in their Genij, and\nwho among the Moderns ; whose Examples\nmay be Authorities for our Belief. I will set\ndown as clearly as I can, what Perception\nMen have had of Genij, or Spirits, by the\nSense of Seeing ; what by the Serife of Hear\ning ; what by the sense of Feeling, Touching\nor Tasting ; and, in fine, what Perception o-\nthers have had of these Gentj by all the Senses ;\nwhat by Dreams, and what by Magick ; a\nthing rarely to be met with at once in any\nsingle Man, and which seems particular to\nthe Child who was the subject of our last\nlittle Historical Account. When I have\nbrought Examples, and the Opinions of wise\nPhilosophers, and the Evidence of undeniable\nWitnelles ; which one would think sufficient\nto evince Persons, of the Commerce Men have\nwith Spirits, if they were not past all Sense of\nConviction ; I mail, not so much to corrobo\nrate what I fay, as to shame some Wiseacres,\nwho would by their frail Reason scan all\nthings, and pretend to solve the Mysteries\nascribed to Spirits, as facts merely natural,\nand who would banish from the Thoughts\nof Men all Belief of Spirits whatsoever ; I\nlhall,I fly, (in order to put to shame these Wise\nacres,\nr\n+\n>*\n\f78 The Life and Adventures\nacres, if they have any Shame left) produce\nthe Opinions of the Fathers as Divines, ihew\nthe Doctrine of Spirits in general to be con\nsistent with Christianity ; that they are deli\nvers in the Scripture, and by Christian Tra\ndition ; in which if they will not acquiesce, I\nshall leave them to the Labyrinth of their\nown wild Opinions, Which in the end will\nso perplex their Judgments of Things, that\nthey will be never able to extricate themselves.\nAnd these different Heads will be the Subject\nof the Chapter ensuing ; and will (or I am\ngreatly mistaken ) form both an instructive,\nedifying and entertaining Discourse, for a Rea\nder really and truly intelligent, and that has a\ngood Taste and Relish for sublime Things.\nG H A P. V.\nAn Argument, proving the Perception which\nMen have had, and have, by all the Senses t\nas Seeing, Hearing, &c. of D\u00e6mons, Ge-\nnij, or Familiar Spirits.\nIT\nis said in the Ninth Book of the Mo\nrals of\" Ariftotle, It is better to come at\nthe probable Knowledge of some Things above;\nus in the Heavens, than to be capable of gi\nving many Demonstrations relating to Things\nhere below. This\nis,\nno doubt, an admira\nble Proposition, and speaks the lofty Aims\nof\nv>\n1\n\fes Mr. Duncan Campbell! 79\nof that sublime Mind from whence it pro\nceeded. Among all the Disquisitions in this\nkind, none seem to me more excellent, than\nthose, which treat concerning the Genii, that\nattend upon Men, and guide them in the\nactions of Life. A Genius or Damon of the\ngood Kind is a sort of mediate Being, between\nHuman and Divine, which gives the Mind of\nMan a pleaiant Conjunction with Angelick\nand Celestial Faculties, and brings down to\nEarth a faint Participation of the Joys of\nHeaven. That there have been such fortu\nnate Attendants upon wise Men, we have\nmany rare instances. They have been ascri\nbed to Socrates, Aristotle, Plot'mus, Porphyri-\nus, Jantblicus, Cbicus, Scatter and Cardan,\nThe most celebrated of all these Ancients was\nSocrates ; and as for his having a Genius or\nDamon, we have the Testimonies of Plato,\nXenophon and Antisthenes, his Contemporaries,\nconfirm'd by Laertius, Plutarch, Maximua\nTyrius, Dion Chrysostomus, Cicero, Apuleius,\nFicinMy and others, many of the Moderns be\nsides Tertullian-, Origen,Clemens Alexandrinus,\nAustin and others ; and Socrates himself in\nPlato s Theage, fays, By some Divine Lot I\nhave a certain Damon, which has followed\nme from my Childhood as an Oracle ; and in the\nfame Place intimates, that the Way he gain'd\nhis instruction was by hearing the Damons\n\"Voice. Nothing is certainly so easy as for\nMen to be able to contradict Things, tho' ne\nver\nr\n\f8o The Life and Adventures\nVer so well attested with such an Air of Truth,\nas to make the Truth of the History doubted\nby others as well as themselves where no\ndemonstrative Proof can be brought to con\nvince them. This has been the easy Task\nof those who object against the Demon of So\ncrates ; but when no demonstrative Proof is\nto be had on either Side, does not Wisdom\nincline us to lean to the most Probable ? Let\nus then consider whether the Evidences are\nnot more credible, and Witnesses of such a\nthing are not Persons of more authority,\nthan these Men are, who vouchsafe to give\nno reason but their own incredulity for main\ntaining the contrary; and whether those there\nfore by the right rule of judging, ought not\nmuch sooner than these, to gain over our,\nAssent to their Assertions ?\nWe will however, laying aside the Histo\nries of those ancient Times, the Sense where- .\nofj by Various Readings and Interpretations\nbeing put upon the Words, is render d obj\nseiire and almost unintelligible, descend td\nmore modern Relations, the facts whereof\nshall be placed beyond doubt, by reason of the\nEvidences we will bring to attest them, and\nmail consequently prove the Perception Men\nhave of Spirits or Gen)] by every sense.\nSECTION I.\nWe will first begin as to the perception of\nSpirits by the Sight.\nMr.-\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 8k\n'. *Mr. Glanvil, in his collection of relations,\nfor proving Apparitions, Spirits, &c. tells u*\nof an Irijlmian, that had like to have been\ncarried away- by Spirits, and of the Ghost of\na Man who had been Seven Years dead, that\nbrought a Medicine to his Bedside. \u25a0 \u25a0\n\"\n:\u25a0\nThe Relation is thus :\n.\";\n-'\u25a0\nA\nGentleman in Ireland, near to the Earl\nofOrrery's, fending his Butler oneAfternoon to\nbuy Cards\n;\nas he pass'd\na\nField, to his Won\nder\n,\nhe espy'd\na\nCompany of people sitting\nround\na\nTable, with\na\ndeal of good Chear\nbefore them, in the Midst of the Field\n:\nAnd\nhe going up towards them, they all arose and\nsaluted him, and desired him to sit down with\nthem\n;\nbut one of them whisper\n'd\nthese Words\nin his Ear ;\u2014Do nothing this company invites\nyou to.

This Damon walfc'd many times in\nParkers Bed-Chamber, without any Action\nof Terror, Noise, Hurt or Speech ; but at\nlast, one Night, broke out in these Words :\nMr. Parker, I know you lov'd me formerly,,\nand my Son George at this Time very well :\nI would have you go from me, (you know\nme very well to be his Father, old Sir George\nViUars, of Leicestershire ; ) and acquaint him'\nwith these and these Particulars , &c. and\nthat he above all refrain the Council and\nCompany of such and such, (whom he then\nnominated') or else he will come to Destru\nction, and that suddenly. Parker, tho' a ve\nry discreet Man , partly imagin'd himself in\na Dream all this Time ; and being unwil\nling to proceed upon no better Grounds, for\nbore addressing himself to the Duke ; for he\nconceived, if he sliould acquaint the Duke\nwith the Words of his Father, and the Man\nner of his Appearance to him, (such Appa\nritions being not usual) he should be laugh' d\nat, and thought, to doat, in regard he was\n4g\u00abd:\\ Some few Nights pass'd without fur\nther\n\fos Mr. DuxcakCampJej.it 93\nther Trouble to the old Man : But not ray\nmany Nights after, old Sir George VjLer: ap\npeared again, walkd quick and furiously in\nthe Room, seem'd angry wkh Parker, and at\nlast (aid, Mr. Parkers I thought yon had been\nmy Friend so much,, and lovd ray Son Ge**\u00a3c\nIb well , that you would have acquainted\nhim with what I desired ; but.

The old Man seeing himself thus\nsolicited, promised the D*m*\u00bb he would ; bat\nfirst argued it thus ; That the Duke was not\neasy to be spoken withal ; and that be would\naccount bint a. vain Man , to come with suck\na Message from the Dead :\u25a0 Nor did he con*\neeiVe the Duke would gjive any Credit to\nhim.

Atv\/i\nhe tells us, that Parker was an Officer\nin\nthe\nKing's Wardrobe in Windsor-Caftle, of\na\ngood\nReputation for Honesty and Discretion, and\nthen about the Age of Fifty Years* or more.\nThis Man had in his Youth been bred in.\nft\nSchool in theParisti where Sir George Villars\n(the Father of the Duke) liv'd\n;\nand had been\nmuch cherifh'd and obligct in. that Steason of\nhis Age,\nby\nthe said; Sir George, whom after\nwards he never saw.;.

So far the Lord Clarendon.\nI will now subjoin an authentick Relation,\nwhich Dr. Beaumont tells us at the End of\nhis Book of Genijy or Familiar Spirits, print\ned in the Year 1705-, he had just before re\nceived from the Mouth of Dr. Fowler , then\nBishop of Gloucester, himself. It is as fol\nlows, Word for Word.\n\u2022\nSit Charles Lee, by his first Lady, had only\none Daugliter, of which she died in Child\nbirth j and when (he died, her Sister,. :the\n\u2022 '. 'I- Lady\n\fof \u00c6sKDtitfCAN CampbelI. 97\n\u00a3ady Everard desir'd to have the Education\nof the Child ; and she was by her very well\neducated, till she was Marriageable ; and a\nMatch was concluded for her with Sir Wil\nliam Perkins, but \\v2ls then prevented in art\nextraordinary rrianrler. Upon a Thursday -\nNight, she thinking she saw a Light in her\nChamber after slie was in, Bed, knock'd for\nher Maid, who presently came to her ; and\nshe ask'd why (he left a Candle burning in\nher Chamber ? The Maid said, me left none ;\nand there was none, but what she brought\nwith her at that Time. Then she said it was\nthe Fire : But that, the Maid told her, was\nquite Out ; and said, she believ'd it was only\na Dfearh ; whereupon she said, it might be\nso ; and compos'd her self again to Sleep : But\nabout Two of the Clock she was awaken'd a-\ngain, and saw the Apparition of a little Wo\nman, between her Curtain and her Pillow :\nWho told her, she was her Mother ; and that\nslie was Happy ; and that by Twelve of the\nClock that Day, ihe should be with, her :\nWhereupon she knock'd again for her Maidj\nCalled for her Cloaths ; and when me was\ndress'd, went into her Closet, and came not\nbut again till Nine ; and then brought out\nwith her a Letter seald to her Father, brought\nit to her Aunt, the Lady Everard , told her\nwhat had happen'd ; and desir'd, that as soorl\nas Ihe was dead , it might be sent ro him i\nBut the Lady thought she was suddenly fallen\nH V\n\u25a0\nMad i\n\f98 The Life and Adventures\nMad ; and thereupon sent presently away to\nCbelmsford, for a Physician and Surgeon, who\nboth came immediately ; but the Physician\ncould discern no Indication of what the Lady\nimagined, or of any Indisposition of her Bo\ndy ; notwithstanding the Lady would needs\nhave her let Blood, which was done accor\ndingly : And when the young Woman had\npatiently let. them do what they would with\nher, file desir'd that the Chaplain might be\ncalled to read Prayers ; and when Prayers\nwere ended, she took her Gitktar and Psalm-\nbook, and fat down upon a Chair without\nArms, and play'd and fung so melodiously\nand admirably, that her Musick-Master, who\nwas then there, admir'd at it : And near the\nStroke of Twelve, me rose and sat her self\ndown in a great Chair with Arms j and pre\nsently fetching a strong Breathing or two,\nimmediately expir'd ; and was so suddenly\ncold, as was much wonder'd at by the Physi\ncian and Surgeon. She died at Waltham, in\nEJjex, Three Miles from Chelmsford ; and the\nLetter was sent to Sir Charles, at his House\nin Warwickshire ; but he was so afflicted with\nthe Death of his Daughter, that he came not\ntill she was buried : But when he came, he\ncaus'd her to be taken up, and to be buried\nby her Mother at Edmonton, as she desir'd\nin her Letter. This was about the Year One\nThousand Six Hundred and Sixty Two, or\nSixty Three. And this Relation the Right\nz Reve\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 99\nReverend the Lord Bishop of Gloucester had\nfrom Sir Charles Lee himself ; and Dr, Beau\nfoioht printed it in his Book abovemehtioned,\nfrom the Bishop's own Mouth.\nThe Relations which I have given above,\nare not like the trifling Accounts too often\ngiven of these Things, and therefore causing\ngrave ones to be ridiculed in common with\nthem. They are of that Nature, that who\never attempts to ridicule them, will, instead\nof turning them into Jest, become the Object\nof Ridicule himself.\nThe first Story, which has in it such ama\nzing Circumstances, and such uncommon and\ndreadful Incidents concerning the Butler in\nIreland, is (as the Reader fees) attested by no\nleft a personage than an Earl of Orrery ; Two\nbishops, and many other Noblemen and Gen\ntlemen, being present, and Eye- witnesses of\nwhat the earl said. What greater Testimony\nwould the most incredulous have ? They\nfry, such things are told for Interest : What\ninterest could an Earl, and many Noblemen\nhave, in promoting such an imposture ? The\nincredulous fay likewise, Great and Learned\nMen delight sometimes in putting Frauds up\non the World, and after laugh at their Creduli\nty. Would a Number of Noble Laymen chuse\nTwo Prelates to carry on such a Fraud ? And\nwould Two Pious Bijbops probably combine\nwith several^ and some Servants there present,\nin spreading such a deceit ? 'Tis past belie-\nH * ving,\n291639K\n\fioo The Life and Adventures >\nving, and it demands the strictest of Moral\nFaith that can be given, to the most unque\nstioned History that the Pen of Man ever\nwrote.\nThe Second Story is founded , first, upon\nthe Experience of one of the most ingenious\nMen of that Age, Dr. Donne ; and then upon\nthe Proof made by his Friend, Sir Robert\nDrury, who could at first scarce believe it :\nAnd shall we doubt the Credit of Men, whose\nCompany ( for their Credit be it spoken) a\nBritish Ambaslador was proud of gaining ?\nThe Third Story is told by Luther himself,\nwho began the great Work of the Reformation,\nThe Fourth is told by one that was a King's\nPublick Minister, and told from his own Tri\nal of the Matter, where he could have no in\nterest in the telling it.\nThe Fifth is related by those great Histori\nans, the Lord Clarendon, and Sir Richard Ba\nker ; as a Truth rely'd upon by themselves,\nand fit to be credited by their Readers.\nThe Sixth and last was related to Dr. Beau\nmont, by the Lord Bishop of Gloucester, who\nreceiv'd the Account from Sir Charles Lee\nhimself, to whose Grand-Daughter the Mat\nter happen'd.\nMen, who will not believe such Things as\nthese, so well attested to us, and given us by\nsuch Authorities, because they did not lee\nthem themselves, nor any Thing of the like\nNature, ought not only to deny the Damon\nof\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell ioi\nof Socrates j but that there was such a Man\nas Socrates himself. They should not dispute\nthe Genij of C\u00e6sar, Cicero, Brutus, Marc\nAnthony ; but avow, that there were never\nany such Men existing upon Earth, and over\nthrow all credible History whatsoever. Mean\nwhile, all Men, but those who run such\nLengths in their fantastical Incredulity, will,\n&om the Facts above-mention d, rest satisfied,\nthat there are such Things as Evil and Good\nGenij ; and that Men have sometimes a Com\nmerce with them by all their senses, particu\nlarly those of Seeing and Hearing ; and will\nnot therefore be startled at the strange Frag\nments of Histories, which I am going to re\nlate of our young Duncan Campbell, and look\nupon some wonderful Adventures which he\nperform'd by the Intervention of his Familiar\nDemon or Genius, as Falfhoods, only because\nthey are uncommon and surprizing ; more\nespecially since they were notdone inaCorner,\nbut by an open way of Profession of a Predi\nctor of Things, in the Face of the metropolis\nof London, where he settled young ; as will\nappear in the Progress of his Life. However,\nsome People, notwithstanding all this, may\nalledge, that tho' a Man may have a Genius\nappear to him, so as to convey into his Mind,\nthro' his Senses, the Knowledge of Things\nthat are to come to pass ; yet this happens\nbut on very eminent and extraordinary Occa\nsions. The Murder, for Example, of a Prime\nH 3 Mini-\n^\nJ\n\f102 TkeLiiE and Adventures\nMinister, and the Favourite of a monarch,\nin such a manner as it was performed on the\nGreat Buckingham by Fehon, was a Thing\nso uncommon, that it might perhaps deserve,\nby the Permission of Heaven, an uncommon\nPrediction. The others likewise are instances\neminent in their way, particularly that of\nthe Lady Everard's Niece : For that young\nLady being then Marriageable, and a Treaty,\nfor that End being on Foot with Sir William\nPerkins ; the Divine Providence foreseeing\nthat such a State might call away her\nthoughts, hitherto bent on him and Spiritual\nAffairs, and fix them on the trifles of this\nWorld, might perhaps permit her to be cal\nled by a Holy Mother to the State of Hap\npiness she before her enjoy\n'd,\nleft her Daugh\nter\ns\nMind should change, and me go into\nthe Ways of\na\nSinner. But\nif\nthese super\neminent, these scarce and rare examples may\nbe admitted, of Man's holding\na\nConversati\non with the spiritualize! Beings of another\nWorld\n;\nit\nwill, however, be far below the\nDignity of Human Reason, methinks, to make\nsuch large concessions to People, vyhq pre\ntend to converse that wonderful way, as. to\nallow them the Credit of being able'to do\nit\nupon every flight Occasion, and eYejy\nin\ndifferent Occurrence of Human Life.\nI\ncannot help acknowledging, that\na.\nMan\nof Wisdom may, at first thought\nj\nmake such\nan objection\nj\nbut\nReflection willpresently\n.\n'\n,',\n'\nretract\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell, 103\nretract it ; and the same good Sense that taught\nhim to make an objection so well upon the\nfirst Thought, will teach him, upon second\nThoughts, to acquiesce in the Answer.\nInfants may have, no doubt, the Benefit of\nsuch an attending Genius, as well as people\nmore advanced in Years ; as may be seen in\none of the instances, which is a very famous\none, relating to the Boy born in Prussia, who\nwas attended by one constantly from the\nTime of his Birth to his Death. Besides,\nit is a Mistake in the Understanding, to ima\ngine, that Death, which is the Determinati\non and End of Life, is of more Consequence\nto be known, than the Manner of regulating\nthat life. For, in Reality, according to the\nright way of considering, Death, or the De\ntermination of a Man's Life, derives its Im\nportance from the Steps which he took in\nthe due Regulation of it ; and therefore e-\nvery the least Step , proper to be taken for\nthe due Regulation of Life, is of more Con\nsequence to be known , than the Death of\na Person ; tho' this, at first Sight, carries\nthe Face of Significance, and the other no\nthing better than the Look of a Trifle. Mar\nriage, for Example, is a Step in Life of the\nutmost importance, whether we consider that\nEstate with Regard to this, or the next World.\nDeath is but the Finishing of one Person ; but\nMarriage may be the introducing of many\ninto the World with Happiness : It is there-\nH 4 fore\n\f104 The Life and ^dventur es\nfore a Thing of more importance to be known\nbeforehand, and consequently more worthy\nof the Communication of a Genius to the Man\nwith whom he conversed. Pojfidonius tells\nus, that a certain Rhodian dying, nominated\nSix of his Equals, and said who should die\nfirst, who next, and so on, and the Event\nanswer'd the Prediction ;why then (tho' some\nPeople are apt to make a jest of\nit)\nmay not\na\nMan by the intervention of his good Ge\nnius, tell\na\nWoman, that\nis\nto have six Hus\nbands, who she shall have first, who next,\nand\nso\non, and the Event answer the Predi\nction\n>\nIf\nMen of Learning may acquire such\nKnowledge, as to attain to extraordinary\nThings\nby\ntheir ordinary Faculties, why may\nnot ordinary things be taught others in this\nextraordinary way\n'?\nFor will any Body fay\nthat\nit\nis\neasier for\na\nMan to accommodate\nhimself to the knowledge of\na\nDamon or Ge\nnius-, than for\na\nD\u00e6mon or Genius to accom\nmodate himself to the knowledge of\na\nMan\n?\nCertain\nit\nis\nindeed that\nif\nthis good Genius\n(that endues\na\nMan with\na\nprophetic kind\nof Science) be any Thing resembling\na\ngood\nAngel, the primary end of his being permitted\nto direct Mankind, must consist in Things re\nlating more to their Welfare hereafter\nj\nyet\nI\nknow not why they may not sometimes\nin\nspire, or openly direct them\nin\nhuman Know\nledge, and\nin\nThings relating to Human Life,\nso\nthey are of\na\ngood Tendency\n;\nmore espe-\n'\ndally\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell! ioj\ncially since such a good Inspiration may be\na Counter-balance to the bad Knowledge which\nsome have been inspired with by evil Spirits.\nI would not be thought to go too far in a\nPoint of this Nature, and have therefore\n(\"though perhaps I could fay much more if I\nfollow w'd entirely my own private Opinion,\nand would venture to introduce it here, in\norder to communicate it to others, and make\nit a publick one) said no more on this Head\nthan what Divines generally teach.\nBut the most unexceptionable Mistress, that\nteaches these Things to be in Nature, is Ex\nperience. If we had very many People gifted\nthis Way, the extraordinary Thing would have\nbeen become ordinary, and therefore I can't\nhelp wondering that it should be so ordinary\na thing for wife Men themselves to wonder\ntoo much at Things, because they are extra\nordinary, and suspect them as Frauds, because\nthey are uncommon.\nThere has scarce been any Period of Time,\nin which some Person of this Prophetick Class,\nhas not existed, and has not been consulted\nby the greatest of Men, and their predictions\nfound at the long run to come true; ignorant\nMen always rife to their Belief of them by\nExperience, and the most learned Men sub\nmit their great Opinions to experience, but\nyour Men of middling Talents., who make up\ntheir want of Reason with bustling Obstinacy\nand noisy Contradiction, have been and still\nl. 7 ,. . ,\n;... =\n..\/ \"\u2022....\u2022' con..\n\\\n\f106 TheLiTZ and Adventures\ncontinue to be their own Opposers, and with\nout discovering the reason for what they say,\nthey content themselves with having the\nLaugh on their Sides, and barely affirming\nwithout proving, that it is a kind of ideal\njuggle and intel\/efiual Legerdemain, by which\nthese Modern Predictors impose Things up\non the Eye of Reason, as the corporeal Eye is\nimpos'd upon by sleight of Hand ; but it is a\nstrange Thing that Men of such quick Reason\ncan't give us a Sample of the Frauds. Thus I\nremember, to have read (I can't tell where) a\nStory of some Courtiers, who1 when a great\nArtist of Legerdemain was to act before the\nKing, pretended to be so quick- sighted, that\nnothing he did should escape their Discovery,\nwere left by his nimble Fingers in the Dark,\nand sored at last with Blulhes to own they\nhad no better Eyes than other People. In\nthe\nword,\nif\nPeople will be led\nby\nSuspicions and\nremote Possibilities of Fraud and Contrivance\nof such Men, all Historical Truth shall be\nended, when\nit\nconsists not with\na\nMan's pri\nvate Humour or Prejudice to admit it. Now\ntherefore to prove\nby\nExperience and undeni\nable Testimonies, that these kind of Genij\nwill submit to little Offices\nin\norder to bring\nMen to greater good\n;\nI\nwill give the Reader\nThree or Four curious Pallages, that will set\nthe -reasonable Reader at ease,and prepare him\nfor reading the passages of Mr. Campbell's Life\nwith Pleasure, and as\na\nfine History of won\nderful\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 107\ndcrful facts, that though they seem to sur\npass belief yet ought to have his Credit.\nWhat in Nature can be more trivial than\nfor a Spirit to employ himself in knocking on\na Morning at the wainscot by the Beds- head\nof a Man who got Drunk over, night, ac\ncording to the Way that such Things are or\ndinarily explain'd i And yet I mail give you\nsuch a Relation of this, that not even the most\ndevout and precise Presbyterian will offer to\ncall in question. For Mr. Baxter in his Histo\nrical Discourse of Apparitions writes thus.\nThere is now in London an understanding\nsober pious Man, oft one of my hearers, who\nhas an elder Brother, a Gentleman of consi\nderable Rank, who having formerly seem 'd\nPious, of late Years does often fall into the\nSin of Drunkenness ; he often Lodges long to*\ngether here in his Brother's House ; and when\nsoever he is Drunk and has slept himself So\nber, something knocks at his bed. s-head, as\nif one knock'd on a Wainscot ; When they\nremove his Bed it follows him : Besides other\nloud Noises, on other Parts where he\nis,\nthat\nall the House hears\n;\nthey have often watched\nhim, and kept his Hands lest he should do\nit\nhimself\n:\nHis Brother has often told\nit\nme,\nand brought his Wife,\na\ndiscreet Woman, to\nattest\nit\n;\nwho avers moreover, that as she\nwatch'd him, she has seen his Shoes under\nthe Bed taken up, and nothing Visible to\ntouch them. They brought the man himself\n\u25a0'.''.\nV\nto\n\fio8 The Life and Adventures\nto me, and when we ask'd him, how he dare\nSin again after such a Warning, he had no\nExcuse : But being persons of quality, for\nsome special Reason of Worldly Interest I\nmust not name him.\nTwo Things are remarkable in this instance,\n(fays Mr. Baxter ; ) jirjl, What a powerful\nThing Temptation and fleshly Concupiscence\nis,\nand what an harden'd Heart Sin brings\nMen to\n;\nif one rose from the Dead to warn\nsuch Sinners,\nit\nwould not of\nit\nself persuade\nthem.\nSecondly, (says Mr. Baxter) It poses me\nto think what kind of Spirit this\nis,\nthat has\nsuch\na\ncare of this Man's Soul, which makes\nme hope he will recover. Do good Spirits\ndwell\nso\nnear us, or are they sent on such\nMeflages\n>\nOr\nis\nit\nhis Guardian Angel\n?\nOr\nis\nit\nthe Soul of some dead friend that suf\nfers\n;\nand yet retaining Love to him as Dives\nto his Brethren,would have him saved ?\nGod\nyet keeps such Things from us\nin\nthe Dark.\nSo far we have the Authority of the re-\nnown'd and famous Mr. Baxter, who makes\nthis knocking of the Spirit at the Beds-head\n(though what we commonly call frivolous)\nan important Errand.\nAnother Relation of this Kind was sent to\nDr. Beaitmont\nf\nwhom\nI\nmy self personally\nknew, and which he has inserted\nin\nhis Ac-^\ncount of Genii or Familiar Spirits) in\na\nLetter\nby an ingenious and learned clergyman 6F\nWiltshire\n;\nwho had given him the relation\nlikewise\n\fof Mr. ISuncan Campbell 109\nlikewise before by Word of Mouth. It is as\nfollows. .\nNear Eighty Years since, in the Parish of\nWilcot (\"which is by the Devizes) in the Vi\ncar's House, there was heard for a conside\nrable Time the sound of a Bell, constantly\ntelling every Night j the Occasion was this :\nA debauch'd Person who liv'd in the Parish,\ncame one Night very late and demanded the\nKeys of the Church, of the Vicar, that he\nmight ring a Peal, which the Vicar refused\nto let him have, alledging the reasonable\nnefs of the Time, and that he should by grant\ning his Desires give a Disturbance to Sir George\nWrovghton and his Family, whose House ad\njoined to the Church-yard. Upon this Of\nsal the Fellow went away in a Rage, threat\nening to be reveng'd of the Vicar, and going\nsome time after to the Devizes, met with one\nCantle or Cantlow, a Person noted in those\nDays for a Wizard ; and he tells him how\nthe Vicar had serv'd him, and begs his Help\nto be even with him. The Reply Cantel\nmade him was this : Does he not love Ring\ning ? He shall have enough of it : And from\nthat Time a Bell began to Toll in his House,\nand continued so to do till CanteWs Death,\nwho confessed at Fifiierton Goal in Santrn,\nfwhere he was confin'd by King James du\nring his LifeJ that he caus'd that Sound, and\nthat it should be heard in that place during\nLife. The Thing was so notorious, that\nPersons\n\fno The Life and Adventures\nPersons came from all Parts to hear it. And\nKing James sent a Gentleman from London,\non purpose to give him Satisfaction concern\ning the Truth of the Report. Dr. Beaumont\nhad likewise this Story as he tells, from the\nMouth of Sir George Wroughtoris own Son ;\nwith this remarkable Circumstance, That if\nany in the House put their Heads out of the\nWindow, they could not hear the Sound ,\u2022 but\nheard it immediately again, as soon as they\nstood in the Room.\nThe Reader here fees, that good and bad\nGeni'j exercise themselves upon very little\nFunctions ; Knocking at Beds-Heads, and\nRinging of Bells. For Proof of this, we have\nthe Testimonies of Two divines, of a Man\nof Quality and Probity, and the fame Satis\nfaction that a Learned King had,' who sent to\nenquire into the Matter : And after this, there\ncan be, I think, no room for Doubt.\nBut to carry the Point still nearer Home :\nInasmuch as I know some will leave no Stone\nunturn'd, to make the Extraordinary actions,\nwhich the Person whose Life I write, has\nperformed, appear Impostures ; and inasmuch\nas for this End they may fay, that tho' many\nPeople may have been gifted in this extraordi\nnary manner, yet not so as to make a Pro\nfession of\nit,\nand therefore from thence they\ntake their suspicions\n;\nI\nshall,\nin\nthis Place, to\nremove every nicest Scruple they can have\ntouching this Affair, give the reader one\nInstance\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell hi\nInstance of this kind likewise, before I pro\nceed with my History.\nThere liv'd, not many Years since, a very\naged Getlewoman in London, in Water-Lam\nby Fleetjlreet, whose Name was Tight, who\nwas endowed with a Prophetick Spirit : And\nthe ingenious Dr. Beaumont (whom I perso\nnally knew, and who had a Familiar Genius\nhimself) gives the World this Account of her.\nShe was very well known, fays he, to many\nPersons of my Acquaintance, now living in\nLondon : Among others, a gentleman, whose\nCandour I can no way suspect, has told me,\nthat he often resorted to her, as to an Oracle ;\nand that as soon as he came into her presence,\nshe would usually tell him, that she knew what\nhe was coming for, for that she had seen his\nSpirit for some Time before : And without\nhis saying any Thing to her, she would com\nmonly tell him what the business was, which\nhe came to consult her about , and what the\nEvent of it would be ; which he always found\nto fall out as \/he said ; and many other Per\nsons now living , can testify the like Experi\nence of her as to themselves.\nBefore I conclude this Chapter, I am wil\nling to give the Publick one farther little Hi\nstory of the like kind with the foregoing ones ;\nwith this only Difference, That if it be valued\naccording to the Worth the World has al\nways attributed to the very ingenious Person\nwhom it concerns,, it will be far the most fa\nmous\n\fttfc The Life and Adventures\nmous of them all, and therefore fittest to fi\nnish this Chapter, and to crown this part of\nthe Work, in which we are showing that Al\nsons have had a Perception of Genii or Spirits*\nnot visible at the fame time to others.\nThe famous Torquatw Tajso Prince of the\nItalian Poets, and scarce inferior to the im\nmortal Virgil himself, and who seems to en\njoy the intermingled Gifts of the most ac\ncurate judgment of this Latin poet, and the\nmore fertile and copious Invention and Fancy\nof the Greek pne, Homers strongly affected his\nown experience in this kind. His Life was\nwritten and published in French, Anno 1692,\nby D. C. D. D. V. who, in his Preface tells\nus, that, in what he writ, he has followed\nchiefly the History given us in Italian by\nJohn Baptifia Manso, a Neapolitan Gentle\nman, who had been a very intimate Friend to\nTajso. In his Life, among other Things, he ac\nquaints us, that Tajso was naturally ofthat me-\nlancholick Temperament, which has always\nmade the greatest Men, and that this Tem\nperament being aggravated by many Hard\nships he had undergone, it made him some\ntimes beside himself, and that those melan-\ncholick Vapours being dispatched, he came\nagain to himself, like those, that return from\nFits of the falling Sickness, his Spirit being\nas free as before. That, near his latter end,\nhe retired from the City of Naples, td his\nFriend Manso, at Bisaccia, a small Town in\nthe\n\fof Mr. DuncanCa m p b ex l. i 1.3\nthe Kingdom of Naples, where Manfo had a\nrconsiderableEstate, and passdan Autumn there\nin the Diversions of the Season.\nAnd here the French Author gives us an\naccount of Taffos sensible perception of a\nGenius, as follows. As, after these Amuse\nments, he usually retir'd to his Chamber, to\nentertain himself there with his Friend Manfo,\nthe latter had the Opportunity to enquire into\none of the most singular effects of Tajsos\nMelancholy, (of this Heroick Melancholy, as\nI may call\nit)\nwhich rais'd and brighten'd his\nSpirit\nj\nso far\nit\nwas from depressing, or ren-\ndring\nit\nobscure\n;\nand which, among the An\ncients, would have reasonably caus'd them\nto have ascribed\na\nFamiliar Demon to him, as\nto Socrates. They were often\nin\na warm De\nbate, concerning this Spirit, with which Taf-\nJo\npretended to have so free\na\nCommunicati\non. I'm too much your Friend, said Manfo\nto him one Day, not to let you know what\nthe World thinks of you concerning this\nThing, and what\nI\nthink of\nit\nmy self.\nIs\nit\npossible, that being enlighten'd as you are,\nyou should be fallen into\nso\ngreat\na\nweakness,\nas to think you have\na\nFamiliar Spirit\n?\nAnd\nwill you give your Enemies that Advantage,\nto be able to prove by your own Acknowledg\nment, what they have already published to\nthe World\n?\nYou know, they fay you did not\npublish your Dialogue\nof\nthe Messenger, as\na\nFiBion\n;\nbut you would have Men believe,\nI\nthat\n\fn4 The Life and Adventures\nthat the Spirit, which you make to speak\nthere, was a real and true Spirit : Hence Men\nhave drawn this injurious consequence, That\nyour Studies have embroil d your Imaginati\non ; so that there is made in it a confused\nMixture of the Fictions of the Poet s, the In\nventions of the Philosophers, and the Doctrine\ns Religion.\nI am not ignorant, answer 'd Tajso, of all\nthat is spread abroad in the World, on the\nAccount of my Dialogue : I have taken care\ndivers Times to disabuse my Friends, both\nby Letter and Word of Mouth : I prevented\nev'n the Malignity of my Enemies, as you\nknow, at the Time I publisiYd my Dialogue.\nMen could not be ignorant, that I composed\nit for the young Prince of Mantua ; to whom\nI would explain, after an agreeable manner,\nthe principal mysteries of the Platonick Phi\nlosophy. It was at Mantua it self, after my\nSecond Flight from Ferrara, that I form'd the\nIdea of it ; and I committed it to Paper a lit\ntle after my unfortunate Return. I addressed\nit to this Prince ; and all Men might have\nread in the Epistle Dedicatory, the Protestation\nI there make, that this Dialogue being writ\nt according to the doctrine of the Platonich,\nwhich is not always conformable to reveal'd\nTruths ; Men must not confound what I ex\npose there as a Philosopher, with what I be-\n-\nlievc as a Christian. This Distinction is by so\nmuch the more reasonable, that at that Time;\n:\" nothing\n\fOs Mr. DuNCi.NCAMPBELlr; gfjf\nnothing extraordinary had-happen'd to me ;\nand I {spake not of any Apparition. This can\nbe attested by all those with whom I lodged, or\nwhom Ifrequented in thisvoyage ; and there\nfore there is no Reason for confounding the s\nction of my Dialogue, with what has happen'd\nto me since. I am persuaded of all you say to\nme, reply 'd Manso ; but truly I cannot be, of\nwhat you believe, at present, concerning your\nself. Will you imagine, that you are in Com-'\nmerce with a Spirit ? And Iask you, of what\nOrder is that spirit ? Shall we place him in\nthe number of the rebels, whom their Pride\nprecipitated into the Abyss \/ Or of the Intel\nligences, who continued firm in Faith, and\nSubmission to their Creator ? For there is no\nMean to take in the true Religion ; and we\nmuft not fall into the Extravagances of the\nGnomes and Sylphs of the Cahalijls.\nNow the Spirit in question cannot be a\nDamon. You own, that instead ofinspiring you\nwith any Thing contrary to Piety and Religion,\nhe often fortifies in you the Maxims of Chri\nstianity ; lie strengthens your Faith by pro\nfound Reasonings, and has the fame Respect\nwith you for sacred Names and Things. Nei\nther can you rthat its an Angel ; for tho'\nyou have always led a regular Life, and far\nfrom all Dissoluteness ; tho', for some Years\npast, you have applyd. your self after a par\nticular manner to, the Duties of a true Chri\nstian ; you will agree with me, that these Sorts\nI a 4\n\fii5 The Life' sAdventures\nof Favours are not common \u2022\nthat a Man must\nhave attained to a high Degree of sanctity,\nand not be far from the pureness of C\u0153lestial\nSpirits, to merit a familiar Converse, and bear\na harmony with them. Believe me, there\nis nothing in all these Discourses, which you\nimagine you have with this Spirit. You know,\nbetter than any Man, those Symptoms, which\nthe black Humours, wherewith you are tor\nmented, causes in'yotu Your Vapours are\nthe Source of your Visions,* and your (elf would\nnot judge otherwise of another Person , ta\nwhom a like Thing should happen : And you\nwill come to this in your own Respect also,\nif you will make a mature reflection, and\napply your self to blot out, by an Effort of\nReason, these Imaginations, which the Vio\nlence of your evil Effects causes in you.' You\nmay have Reason, reply 'd Taffo, to think so\nof the Things that pass in me ; but as to my\nself, who have a sensible Perception of them,\nI am forced to reason after another manner.\nIf it were true, that the Spirit did not Ihew\nhimself\" to me, but in the violent Ailault of\nmy Vapours ; if he' offer'd to my Imagina\ntion, but wandering and confused Species,\nwithout connection or due Sequel ; if he us'd\nto me frivolous Reasonings, which ended in\nnothing ; or\nif,\nhaving begun some solid Rea\nsoning, he broke\nit\noff\" on\na\nsudden, and left\nme\nin\nDarkness\n;\nI\nshould believe with you,\n^at\nall things that paft, are but mere Dreams\n^- - - and\n\fof Mr* Dunc a-n Ca mpbell i 17 .\nand Phantoms. But it's quite otherwise. :\nThis Spirit is a Spirit of Truth and Reason ;\nand of a Truth so distinct, of a Reason so ,\nsublime, that he raises me often to Know- ,\nledges that are above all my Reasonings, tho'\nthey appear to me no less clear ; That he\nteaches me Things, which, in my most pro\nfound meditations, never came into my Spi\nrit, and which I never heard of any Man,\nnor read in any Book. This Spirit therefore\nis somewhat of real ; of whatsoever Order he\nbe, I hear him and see him, nevertheless for\nits being impossible for me to comprehend\nand define him. Manso did not yield to these\nfacts , which Tajso would have pasi'd for\nProofs : He press 'd him with new questions,\nwhich were not without Answers. Since you.\nwill not believe me on my Word, said y\"\nto him, another Day, after having well dis\nputed, I must convince you by your own\nEyes, that these Things are not pure Imagi\nnations. And the next Day conversing toge\nther in the same Chamber, Manso perceiv'd,\nthat on a sudden he fix'd his Eyes towards\nthe Window, and that he stood , as it were,\nimmovable ; he called to him, and jogg'd him*\nmany times : But instead of answering him ;\nSee there the Spirit, fays Tajso at last, that\nhas been pleased to come and visit me, and to\nentertain himself with me J Look on him, and\nyou will acknowledge the Truth of what Isa\/.\n>..;; i'-,;i ?..'. - 1 1 Mans@\n<\"\n'->\n\fxf 8 The Life and Ai>VEtt*u*ES\n\u25a0Matiso, somewhat surprized, Cast his tye's-\ntowards the Place he ftiewM him, and per-^\ncelv'd nothing 'bat thellays tltfk Surpas\nsing through the Glass ? nor did -Ik fee any\nThirlg in all the Chamber, th\u00bb he cast his\nEyes round it With Curiosity : Arii he desir'd\nhim to shew him the Spirit, which he look'd\nfor m Vairt, while he heard Tajjb-ife&k With\nrauch Vehemtncy. \u25a0\n'\nHe declares in \u2022\na Eetter j\nwhich he writ concerning this fd the* AdrttL-:\nral of Naples, that he #eally heard no othef ;\nVoice bvX-Taflos own- : But there (vete some\ntimes Question s made by him to the pretended\nSpirit, iometimes Anftbers, that He made to\nthe pretended Quejlidni r Of the' Spirit % and\nwhich were couch o iri siicli admlrablfe Terms,\nso efficacious , concerning Subjects so ele\nvated and so extraordinary, that he was ra-\nvifli'd with Admiration, and dared not to\ninterrupt him.

On the contrary,\nanfvver'd Matiso\n\u2022\nI am more erribroil'd than\never : I have truly heard wonderful Things j\nbut you have not stiewed me what you pro\nmise! me.

He stopp'd\nhere $v and Manso, who could not recover\nhim-\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell. 119\nhimself of his Surprize, and had his Head\nfil\nled with the Ideas of this extraordinary En\ntertainment, found himself not\nin\na\ncondition\nto press him further. Mean while he engag\nd\nhimself not to speak\na\nWord to any Man of\nthese Things he had heard, with\na\nDesign to\nmake them Publick, tho' he should have Li\nberty granted him. They had many other\nConversations concerning this Matter\n;\nafter\nWhich, Manso own'd, he was brought to that\nPass, that he knew not what to think or fay\n;\nonly, that\nif\nit\nwere\na\nweakness\nin\nhis Friend\nto believe these visions, he much feared\nit\nwould prove contagious to him\n;\nand that\nhe should become at last as credulous 3$ him\nself.\nDr. Beaumont, who\nis\nstill living, and with\nwhom\nI\nhave had formerly some Acquaint\nance my self, has set down, among others,\nthis Relation at large concerning Tajjso\nj\nand\ngives this Reason tor\nit\n:\nBecause, fays the\nDoctor,\nI\nthink\nit\ncontains a sufficient answer\nto what many Learned Friends have said to\n^\nmy self on the like occasion.\nPerhaps\nit\nmay not be ungrateful to the\nReader,\nif\nI\nsubjoin here the short FXogium\nwrit on lasso,\nby\nthe famous Thuanus\n;\nwhich\nis\nas follows'.\nTorquatus Taslb died about the Forty fifth\n\u25a0\nYear\nof\nhis Age\n;\na\nMan\nof\na\nwonderful and\n,\nprodigious Wit, who was seized with an inett'\ntable Fury in bis Tonth, when he lived at the\nI\n4\nCourt\n\fno The Life and Adyentures\nCourt o\/Ferrara, and nevertheless, in lucid-\nIntervals, he writ many Things, both in Verse\nand Prose, with so much Judgment, Elegancy,\nand extreme CorreBness of Stile, that he turn'd\nat length that Pity, which many Men had con\nceived for him, into an Ama&ement ; while by\nthat Fury, which, in others, makes [their Minds\noutrageous, or dulls them, after it was over, his \\\nUnder(landing became as it were more purified,\nmore ready in inventing Things, more.'.acute in\naptly disposing them aster theywere'invented,and\nmore copious in adorning them with cJooiceWprds\nandWeight ofSentences ; and that which a Man\nof the soundest Sense would scarce excogitate\nat his Leffwe,with thegreatest Labour and Care\nimaginable, he, aster a violent Agitation of\nthe Mind set beside it self, naturally perform d\nwith a wonderfid Facility , so that heylid not,\nseem.ftruck with an Alienation of Mind, but\nwith a divine Fury.

London, and taking upon him the Profejfion\nt of a Prediclor j together with an Account\nc of many strange things that came to pass\njust as he foretold.\nTO,proceed on regularly with the Life\nof young Duncan Campbell, I must let\nthe Reader know that he continued thus con\nversing with his little genius, as is set forth\nabove in the Dialogue he had with me, and\npredicting many things of the like nature,\nas I have described, till the Year 1694, when\nhe was just fourteen Years of Age, and then\nhe left Scotland. \u00ab. -.^\nr\n.\nBut before I come to speak of the manner\nof his departure from thence, his half native\nCountry, inasmuch as his Father was of that\nCountry, and he had his Education there,\n(what education he could have, being Deaf\nand Dumb) I must let the reader know that\nin the Year 1692, my very good Friend Mrs.\nCampbel^ his Mother-in-Law, died, and left\nhim\n\fos Mr. Duncan Ca mpbeiE :iij\nhim there at Edinburgh, ah Orphan of\nTwelve Years of Age.\n'\n-\u25a0'\u25a0\n' He was, I may venture to fay, the most\nbeautiful Boy of his Age I ever knew ; and\nthe sensible reader, who considers a Child of\ngood Birth, with the Misfortunes of being\nDeaf and Dumb, left fatherless and Mother\nless in- the wide World, at Twelve Years Old,\nwithout any Competency for his Mainte\nnance and Support, without any Relations,\nin a manner that knew him or assisted him,\nall the little Fortune his Father had, having\nbeen lost in the civil Commotions in Scotland,\nas I have related above, need not hear me\ndescribe the Compassion, I and many more,\nhad for him ; because such a Reader must\ncertainly feel in his own Bosom the fame\nlively acts of Pity and Commiseration, at\nthe hearing of such a Mishap, as I had at the\nseeing\nit,\nor at least as\nI\nhave now reviv'd\nafresh within me at the relating it.\nHowever,\nit\ncame\nso\nto pass, that\na\nPerson\nof the Name of Campbell, and who was\na\ndi\nstant Relation of the Boy, though he himself\nwas but in different Circumstances, was re-\nsolved to see him provided for one way or ano\nther, in\na\nmanner somewhat suitable to his\nCondition, and till that Time to;take the best\ncare of him himself, that he was able.\nSeveral Ladies of Quality, who had known\nhis Perfections, coveted to make the Boy one\n\"if their Domesticks* -as -a Page, or Playj-\nrJ fellow\n\f*\u00ab.tf TkehifE and ADVEtfTijRiEs\nfellow to their Children jsor, though he could\nnot speak, he had such a vivacity in all his\nactions such a Sprightliness of Behaviour,\nand such a, Merriment- accompanying all his\nGestures* that he afforded more EntertainT\nment, than the prettiest and wittiest little\nprattlers at those Years are wont to do. Mr.\nCampbell had certainly accepted of some of\nthese fortunate Offers for his little cousin,\nwhich were many of them likely to prove\nvery Advantageous, if it had not been put\nin his Head by some friends particularly\nmy self, that if he had a mind to dispose of\nthe Boy in that manner, the best way he\ncould take, would be, to present him to the\nlate Earl ol'Argyll, who for his Name's Sake,\nand for his Father's Sake, as well as the Qua\nlifications and endowments of the Boy,\nwould more naturally (according to all Pro\nbability) take a greater Pleasure and Delight\nin him, and consequently provide better for\nhim, and with a more lasting Care, than\nany other Person of Quality, that had a\nsudden liking to him , which might change,\nand took him as a stranger out of a bare Cu\nriosity. Mr- Campbell was by these Reasons\nover-rul'd in the disposal of his little Dumb\nProphetical Cousin, as he call'd him, and re-\nsolv d that an offer should be made of him\nto the present illustrious Duke of Argyll's most\nnoble Father. But it so unfortunately hapr\npened, that the Earl making very much $\nlonger\n\fof Mr. Duncan Ca mpbe %.p .117\nlonger stay at London than was expected,\nMr. Campbell, the Uncle, sent our young Dun\ncan Campbell, his Nephew, hanasomely ac-\ncouter'd, and with a handsome. Sum of Mo\nney in his Pocket, by sea, with Captain\nMeek of Kircaldie to London, with Letters\nof Recommendation to the Earl's Favour ;\nand just a. few days before young Duncan\narrived in London, the Earl was f?t out on\nhit Journey to his Seat in Scotland.\nI had now left him a near Three Years,\nnot having seen him since about a Year after\nhis Mother's Death ; and then coming to Lon\ndon, I had by mere Accident an Appointment\nto meet some Scots Gentlemen at the Buffalo's\nHead Tavern\ngThere happen kl\nat that Time to be a great Concourse of Scots\nNobility there at an Entertainment, and one\nof the Ladies and Gentlemen passing by and\nseeing one of my Friends, desired him to come\nin, and told him both he and his Compani\nons should be very welcome to partake of the\nDiversion. The Lady told him they had got\na lovely Youth, a Scots Miracle among them,\nthat would give us exquisite Delight, and\nwrite down to us all the Occurrences of our\nfuture Lives, and tell us our Names upon our\nfirst Appearance. The Moment I heard of\nit,\nDuncan Campbell came into my Head\n;\nbut\nas\nit\nis\na\nthing not rare to be met with\nin\nScotland, for second-sighted Persons to tell\nsuch Things, and as the Earl of Argyll was\n1\nin\n\f'\n1 18 The Life and A d v entures\n' in the North, I thought little Duncan' s\nbeen under his' protection, and with him, and\n\"did not dream of meeting with him there,\nand accordingly told my Friend, before I\nwent in, that I believed I knew a Lad in\nScotland would exceed this in Foresight, let\n-\nhim be as dextrous in his Art as he would-\n'\nAs soon as I enter'd the Room, I was fur-\npriz'd to find my self encompass'd and fur-\nrounded by a circle of the most beautiful Fe\nmales that ever my Eyes beheld. In the Centre\nof this Angelick Tribe was seated a heavenly\nYouth, with the most winning comeliness of\nAspect, that ever pleased the sight of any Be\nholder of either Sex ; his Face was divinely\nFair, and ting'd only with such a sprightly\nBlush, as a Painter would use to Colour the\nPicture of Health with, and the Complexion\nwas varniih'd over by a Blooming, like that\nof flourishing Fruit, which had not yet felt the\nfirst Nippings of an unkind and an uncivil Air ;\nwith this beauty was join'd such a smiling\nDraught of all the Features, as is the result\nof pleasantry and good Humour. His Eyes\nwere large, full of Lustre, Majestick, well\nset, and the Soul lone so in them, as told\nthe spectators plainly, how great was the in\nward Vivacity of his Genius : The Hair of\nhis Head was thick and reclin'd far below\nhis Shoulders ; it was of a fine Silver Colour,\nand hung down in Ringlets like the curling\nTendrils of a copious Vine. He was by the\nWomen\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell. 1x9\nWomen entertain'd, according to the Claim,\nwhich so many perfections joining in a Youth\njust ripening into Manhood, might lay to the\nbenevolent Dispositions of the tender Sex.\nOne was holding the baton of Water, ano\nther Wafting a Hand, a Third with a Towel\ndrying his Face, which another Fair had gree\ndily snatched the Pleasure of warning before,\nwhile a Fourth was disposing into order his\nSilver Hairs with an Ivory Comb, in an Hand\nas White, \"and which a Monarch might have\nbeen proud to have had so employ 'd in adjust\ning the Crown upon his Head ; a Fifth was\nsetting into order his Cravat 5 a Sixth stole a\nkiss, and blusti'd at the innocent pleasure,\nand mistook her own Thoughts as if(he kifs'd\nthe Angel and not the Man ; and they all ra\nther seemed to adore than to love him, as if\nthey had taken him not for a Person that en\njoy'd the frequent Gift of the second sight,\nbut as if he had been some little Prophet pe\nculiarly inspired ; and while they all thus ad-\nmir'd and wonder'd, they all consulted him as\nan Oracle. The Surprize of seeing a young\nMan so happy amidst the general concurring\nFavours of the Fair, made me be for a while\nlost in a kind of delightful Amazement, and\nthe Consideration of what Bliss he was re\nsesled, made me scarce believe my own Eyes,\nwhen they told me it was Duncan Campbell,\nwho I had left an unhappy Orphan at Edin\nburgh. But so it was, though he was much\nK altered\n\fi^o The Life and Adventures\naltered in Stature, being now shot up pretty\nfast in his Growth since I had seen him, and\nhaving gain'd a kind of a fix'd Comportment i\nsuch as we may daily observe in those, who\nare taking leave of their Minority, and step\nping into a Stage of maturer Life.\nThe first remarkable Thing I knew him do\nin London, being in this splendid Company,\nwhere there were so many undoubted Wit-\nrtesles of quality too, that had Ocular Proof\nof his predictions, was at that tavern : I\nchuse to Record it here, according to its due\norder. It was in the Year 1698.\nAmong this Angelical Class, of Beauties,\nwere Dr. Wind's Lady and Daughter.\nUpon Earth there was not sure a more beau\ntiful Creature than the Daughter ; flie was\nthe Leading Light of all the sparkling Tribe s\nand Otrcays Character suits her exactly ; for\nflie was, \"~;\nAmong Ten Thousand, eminently Fair.\nOne would imagine prosperous and lucky\nFortune was written upon her Face,and thatnc-\ntiiing unhappy could be read in Ib fair a Book ;\nand it was therefore the unanimous Consent\nof all, that, by way of good Omen to the\nrest, his predictions should begin to be open'd\nluckily that Day, and that therefore he should\nfirst of all be consulted about her.\n\". \"Accordingly the Mother to be satisfied of\nhis talent, before they proceeded .to any o\nther Questions* askd him in Writing, if he\nknew\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell' s\nknew the young Lady, he% Name.; and who\nihe was\/.

Jhe .proceeded in\nher questions as to her future Fortune. He\ngaz'd afre\u00c6i at her : very eagerly for some\ntime, and, his Countenance during that time\nof viewing her seem'd to be ruffled with abun\ndance -of Disturbance and. Perplexity.1 We\nall imagined that the youth was. .a little\ntouched at the Heart himself with what he\nsaw, and that instead of 'telling hers,- he had\nmet in her[Bright Eyes with his own Destiny,\nthe Destiny of being for ever made a Slave\nand a Captive, to ib many powerful and al\nmost irresistible Charms.\nAt length, after having a long Debate\nwithin himself, which we thought proceed\ned from the Smugglings of Love and Passion,\nhe fetching a great Sigh, which still con\nvinced us more, took the Pen and wrote to\nMrs. W-lw-dj that he begg d to be excus'd,\nand that his Pen might remain as Dumb\nand Silent as his Tongue, on that Affair.\nBy this Answer we concluded one and all,\nK <z that\n\fijx The Life WAdventures\nthat our former conjectures were true, and\nwe\" joiri'd in pressing him the more earnestly\nto deliver his real and sincere opinion con\ncerning the Accidents upon which the future\nFortunes of her Life were to turn and de\npend. He fhew'd many mighty Reluctances\nin the doing it ; and I have often since con\nsidered him in the fame Anguifli as the late\ngreat Dr. Radcliffe, who was endeavouring by\nStudy to save a certain Fair One, whom he\nloved with a vehemence of temper, and who\nwas (as his Reason told him) got far away\nbeyond the reach of the Art of Physick to\nrecover. At last he wrote in plain Terms,\nthat his Backwardness and Unwillingness td\ntell\nit,\narose from his Wisties that her For\ntune would be better than his certain Fore\nknowledge of\nit\ntold him\nit\nwould be, and\nbegg'd that we would rest satisfied with that\ngeneral Answer, since\nit\nwas in\nso\nparticular\na\nCafe, where he himself was\na\nWell-wisher\nin vain, to the Lady about whom he was\nconsulted. The young Lady herself thinking,\nthat,\nif\nshe knew any Disasters, that were to\nbefall her, she might by knowing the nature\nof them beforehand, and the time when they\nwere likely to happen, be able by timely\nPrudence and Forecast to avert those Evils\n;\nwith many Beseechings, urg'd him to reveal\nthe fatal Secret. After many Struggles to\navoid\nit,\nand as many instances made to him,\nboth by Mother and Daughter, for the Dis-\n#'\ncoverK\n\fe\/Mr. Duncan Campbell.\" 13$\neovery of his prescience in that Point, he\ncomplied with very great Difficulty, and blot\nting the Paper with Tears that trickled fast\nfrom his Eyes, he gave her the lamentable\nScroll, containing the Words that follow, viz.\nI wish it had not fallen to my Lot to tell this\nLady, whom every Body, that but once looks\nat her, must admire, though they must not\nhave leave to love, that she is not much\nlonger to be Possessor of that lovely Face,\nwhich gains her such a number of Adorers.\nThe Small Pox will too soon turn a Ravistier,\nand rifle all those Sweets and Charms that\nmight be able to vanquish a King, and to\nsubdue a Conqueror of mighty Battels.\nHer reign is doom'd alas to be as short as\nit is now Great and Universal ! I believe she\nhas internal Beauties of the Mind, not the\nleast inferior to those external Excellencies of\nthe Body, and she might perhaps by the\nPower of her Mind alone, be absolute Queen\nof the affections of Men, if the Small Pox\nthreaten'd not too surely to be her farther\nEnemy ; and, not contented to destroy the\nFace, was not perverfly bent to destroy the\nwhole Woman. But I want Words to ex\npress my Sorrow. \u2014I would not tell\nit,\nif\nyou did not extort the baneful Secret from my\nBosom. \u2014This fair Creature, whose Beauty\nwould make one wish her Immortal, will by\nthe cruel means of the Small Pox, give us too\nsudden\na\nProof of her Mortality. \u2014But nei-\nK\n3\nther\n\f\"i94: The hirt- -and Any i.srwM.a\nther the Mother hor herself ought too much\nto repine at this, feeing it appears to be the\nDecree of Providence, which is always to be\ninterpreted as meant for our Good, and' fee\ning ?it may be the means of translating her\nthe sooner only to her kindred Angels, who&\nBeauty stle so much' resembles here on Earth,\nand to be among the' lowest Class of whom,\nis better than being the greatest Beauty of the\nWorld here below, and wearing an Imperial\nCrown. \u2014While I comfort you, I can't help\nthe force of Nature, which makes me grieve\nmy self, and I only give you because you\nCompel me to\nit,\nso\nparticular and\nso\nexact\nan Answer, to so particular and\nso\nexacting\na\nQuestion.\n'\n.\n\u2022\n!\nThe Mother, who took the Paper, was\nprudent enough to conceal from the Daugh\nter what he laid, but Nature would force its\nWay, and bubbled from her Eyes\n,-\nand the\nDaughter perceiving that, presled hard to fee\nit,\nand wept at the Consideration of that hard\nFate (though she knew not particularly what\nWay) was to befall her.

Her\nMother was specifically toldj that the fatal Di\nstemper should be the Small Pox\n,-\nher father\"\nwas, and\nis\nstill\na\nvery eminent Physician1\n,-\nand Distempers of that Kind, especially, are\nmuch more easily prevented by Cafe, than\nks\nby\nArt, and by Art more easily set\naside, when there\nis\na\ntimely warning given\nto\na\nphysician to prepare the Body against\nthe danger of the Poison, than when the Die\nstemper has once catch'd hold of\na\nBody at\nunawares, when\nit\nis\nunpurg'd of any gross\nHumours that may accompany\nit.\nBut nei\nther the Foreknowledge and Caution of the\n.\nK\n4\nMother,\n\f136 The Life and Adventures\nMother, nor the Skill and Wisdom of the\ngreat Physician her Father, were sufficient\nto ward off\" the approaching Harm, that was\nwritten in the Books of Fate. Not many\nSuns had finished their yearly Courses before\nshe was forc'd to submit to the inevitable\nStroke of Death, after the infectious and ma\nlicious Malady had first ravag'd her Beauty,\nrioted in all her Sweets, and made an odious\ndeform'd Spectacle of the Charmer of Man\nkind. The predicted Fate of the Daughter\nwork'd so hard upon the Mother's Bowels,\nthat it dragged her first, with a broken Heart\nto the Grave.\nThis Lady, whose Fortune so great and so\ndistinguished an Afiembly had chosen to hear\nas a happy Forerunner and lucky Omen of\nall their own, which were to be ask'd after\nwards in their Turns, proving so contrary to\ntheir Expectations already unfortunate in the\nprediction, and having been in Tears about\nthe Matter, difhearten'd all the rest of the\nBeauties from consulting him farther that\nDay. The Person, who kept the tavern,\nby Name Mrs. Irvin, alledg'd that as some\nPeople were very fortunate, and others un\nfortunate upon the fame Day ; so one Lady\nmight be before told a Milhap one Mi\nnute, and another Lady all the Prosperity in\nNature the very next Minute following ; and\ntherefore that what the unfortunate Lady had\nheard was not to be taken as Ominous, or\nas\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell i.37\nas what could malignantly influence the day,\nneither ought it to be the least hindrance to\nany who had the curiosity of being let into\nthe Secrets of Time before-hand. However,\nwhether the Ladies were convine'd or no ;\nif she prevail'd over theirjgelief in that point,\nshe could not prevail over their Humour,\nwhich\never\nthough they might not believe the\nformer prediction ominous to themselves)\nwas naturally aw'd for fear of the like, per-\nadventure, for\na\nTime\n*,\nand\nso\nit\nwas agreed,\nnemine Contradicente, as\na\nwitty Lady wrote\nit\ndown, that no more Petitions mould for\nthat Day be presented by any of that Com\npany to his Dumb, yet oracular, Majesty.\nMrs.. Irwin, however, would have her way\n;\n(aid, she did not presume to siich Honour as\nto call her self of that Company, and that\ntherefore she might consult him without\nbreaking through the Votes of the Assembly.\nMany endeavour'd to dissuade her, but as the\nwas passionately fond of knowing future E-\nvents\n;\nand had\na\nmighty Itch to be very in\nquisitive with the Oracle, about what might\nhappen, not only to herself, but her Posterity\n;\nit\nwas agreed that he should have the liberty\nof satisfying her curiosity, since the presumed\nher Fortune was sore to be\nso\nGood, and\nwas\nso\nforward and eager for the knowledge\nof it. But (alas!) such\nis\ntoo often the\nfantastical Impulse of Nature unluckily de\npraved, that\nit\ncarries us often into Wishes of\nknow\n\f138 The' Life and Adventures\nknowing, that when known we would be\nglad to unknow again, and then our Memo\nry will not let us1 be untaught.\nMrs. Irwin was at that time in a pretty\ncommodious way of Business, every Thing in\nPlenty round about her, and liv'd more like\na Person of Distinction, that kept such a Cel\nlar of Wine, open House, and a free Table,\nthan like one who kept a Tavern. She\nbrought in her three pretty Children, that\nWere then almost Babies, the youngest having\nnot long been out of the Nurse's Arms, or\ntrusted to the use pf its own Legs. These\nChildren she lov'd as a Mother should love\nChildren % they were the Delight of her Eyes\nall Day, and the Dream of hef Imagination\nall Night. All the Passions Of her Soul were\nconfin'd to them ; (he was never pleas d but\nwhen they were so, and always angry if they\nwere cross'd j her whole Pride was center'd\nin them, and they were cloath'd and went\nattended more like the Infants of a Princess,\nthan of a Vintners Relict. The Fortune of\nthese was what slie had near at Heart, and of\nwhich she was so eager of being immediately\napprized. Her Impatience was proportiona\nble to the Love slie had for them, and which\nmade her wish to foreknow all the Happiness\nthat was like to attend them. She fate chear-\nfttlly down, presented one to him, and smi\nling, wrote the Question in general Terms,\nviz. -Is this Boy to be Happy or Unhappy?\n' *\n'\nA\n\fos Mr. Dun c A n Campmll 139\nA melancholy Look once more spread it self\nall over the face of the predictor, when he\nread the too inquisitive Words ; and he seemed\nmightily to regret being ask'd a question, to\nwhich he was; by his talent \u00a9f Foreseeing,\ncompell'd to give so unwelcome an Answer.\nThe Colour of the poor Woman flufh'd and\nvanisti'd alternately, and very quick ; and (he\nlookid not quite like the picture of despair,\nbut a disconsolate Woman, with little Hopes\non one hand, and great Doubts and disinal\nFears on the other. She professed, she read\ngreat Evil in the Troubles of his face ; thank'd\nhim for his good nature ; told him, that they\nall knew, that tho' he could foretel, he could\nnot alter the Acts and Decretals of Fate ; and\ntherefore desired him to tell her the worst 5 for\nthat the Misfortunes, were they never so\ngreat, would be less dreadful to her, than re\nmaining in the State of Fear and Suspension.\nHe at last wrote down to her, that great and\nunexpected, and even unavoidable Accidents,\nwould involve the whole Family in new Ca\nlamities j that the Son she ask'd him about,\nwould have the bitterest task of Hardship\nto go thro' withal, while he lived ; and that\nto finish all more unhappily, he would be\nsafely and maliciously brought to an untimely\nEnd , by some mortal Enemy or other ; but\nthat me should not trouble herself so much\non that Head, they would never see\nit,\nfor\nit\nwould happen some Years after she was de\nparted\n\f140 Gr and Adventures\nparted from the World. This melancholy Ac:\ncount clos'd up the Book of Predictions for\nthat Day, and put a fad Stop to all the pro\njected Mirth and Curiosity. Now I must tell\nthe Reader, how and when the Event an-\nswer'd the prediction : And in a few Words,\nit was thus : Poor Mrs. Irwin^ by strange Ac\ncidents decay'd in the World, and dying Poor,\nher Sons were forc'd to be put out Apprenti\nces to small Trades j and the Son, whom the\nabovemention'd Prediction concern 'd, was,\nfor stealing one Cheese from a Man in the\nHay-Market, severely prosecuted at the Old-\nBaily ,\u2022 and on Wednesday, the Twenty-third\nof p.ecettiber 1713, hang'd at Tyburn with se\nveral other Criminals.\nThe Two foregoing Paslages are of so Tra\ngical a Nature, that it is Time I should re\nlieve the Minds of my Readers, with some\nHistories of Ladies, who consulted him with\nmore success and Advantage ; to whom his\npredictions were very entertaining, when they\nso came to pass in their Favour ; the Relation\nwhereof will consequently be agreeable to all\nReaders, who have within them a Mixture of\nhappy Curiosity, and good Nature.\nTwo Ladies, who were the most remark\nable Beauties in London, and the most courted,\nturn 'd at the fame Time their Thoughts to\nMatrimony ; and being satiated, I may say\nwearied, with the Pleasure of having conti\nnually after them a great Number and Variety\nof\n\fofMr. Duncan Campbell! 14'i'\nof adorers, resolv'd each, about the fame\ntime, to make choice of their several Men,\nto whom they thought they could give most\nHappiness, and from whom they might re\nceive most. Their Names (for they are both\nPersons of Distinction) shall be Phri\/tal\/ina,\nand Urbana. Chrijlallina was a Virgin, and\nUrbana a young widow. Chrijiallina engross'd\nthe Eyes, the Hearts,' and the Sighs of the\nwhole Court, and whereeverfhe appear'd, put\nany Court-Lady out of her Place, that had\none before in the Heart of any Youth j and\nwas the celebrated Toast among the Beau\nMonde. Urbana s Beauty made as terrible Ha-\nvock in the City : All the Citizens Daugh\nters, that had many Admirers, and were in\nfair hopes of having Husbands, when they\npleased themselves ; as soon as Urbana had lost\nher old Husband, found that they every Day\nlost their Lovers ; and 'twas k general Fear\namong the prettiest Maids, that they should\nremain Maids still, as long as Urbana remain'd\na Widow. She was the Monopolizer of City\naffection ; and made many Girls, that had\nlarge Stocks ofSuiters, Bankrupts in the Trade\nof Courtship, and broke some of their Hearts,\nwhen her Charms broke offtheir Amours. \u2014\nWell ; but the Day was near at Hand, when\nboth the Belles of the Court, and the City\nDamsels, were to be freed from the Ravages,\nwhich these Two Tyrants, triumphant in\nBeauty, and insolent in Charms, made among\nthe\n\fi^z The Life and Adventures\nthe Harvest of Love. Each had seen her\nproper man, to whom the Enjoyment of her\nPerson was to be dedicated for Life : But, it\nbeing an affair of so lasting Importance, each\nhad a Mind' s be let into the Knowledge\nof the Consequences of such a Choice, as far\nas possible, before they stepped into the irre\nvocable State of Matrimony. Both of them\nhappened to take it into their Heads, that the\nbest way to be entirely satisfied in their Curi\nosity, was to have Recourse to the great Me\ndictor of. future occurrences, Mr. Duncan\nCampbeflywhofe Fame was at that Time spread\npretty largely about the Town. Chriftallina\nand Urbana were not acquainted with each\nother, only, by the Report which Fame had\nmade of Beauty. They came to Mr. Camp\nbell's on the fame Day, and both with the\nlame Resolution of keeping themselves; cqa-j\nPol and under masks, that none of ac\ncompany of Consulted who.^append to be\nthere, might know who they were, I\nIt hap^\npen'd that on that very day, just when they,\ncame, Mr. Campbell's Rooms Were more than\nordinarily crowded with curious Clients of\nthe Fair Sex ; so that he was oblig'd to desire\nthese two Ladies, who expressed so much\nPrecaution against, and Fear of having their\nPersons discoverd, to be contented with only\none Room between them ; and with much\nado, they comply 'd with the Request, and\ncondescended to sit together Incog.

The\nSilence between them was very, formal and\nprofound, for near Half anHour ,\u2022 and nothing\nwas to be heard but the snapping of Fans,\nwhich they both did very tuneably, and with\ngreat Harmony, and play'd (as it were ) in\nConsort. \u2022\n;, \u2022'\n,\n\u25a0 ,\n0 ..-:rr, ,c\n\u2022\u2022\nQ&\nv 'At last one of the Civil, jweu-.bred.

They found they did\nnot know one another's voices, ; and they\nbegan to talk, very merrily together, with\npretty great Confidence j and they taking 3\nmutual Liking from Conversation^ so much\nFamiliarity grew thereupon instantly between\nthem, that they began not only to unmask\nbut to unbosom themselves to one another,\nand confess alternately all their Secrets. Chri-\nJlallina own'd who he was. ; and told TJrbana;\nthe Beau and Courtier, that had her heart\nUrbana as frankly declar'd , that she was a\nWidow ; that she would not become the La\ndy's Rival ; that fire had pitch'd upon a Se\ncond Husband, an Alderman of the City,\nJust\n\f144 The Life and AdventuA.es\nJust by that Time they had had their Chat\nout, and wifh'd one another the Pleasure of\na successful Prediction, it came to ChristaU'tnds\nTurn to visit the Dumb Gentleman, and re\nceive from his Pen Oracular Answers, to all\nthe Questions she had to propose. Well ; he\naccordingly satisfy 'd her in every Point she\nask'd him : But while she was about this,\none of Mr. Campbell's Family going with Ur\nbana, to divert her a little ; the Widow rail'd\nat the Virgin as a Fool, to imagine that she\nshould ever make a Conquest of the bright\nest Spark about the Court ; and then let fly\nsome random Bolts of Malice, to wound her\nReputation for Chastity. Now it became the\nWidow's Turn, to go and consult : And the\nseme Person of Mr. Campbells Family, in the\nmean Time entertain'd Christ allina. The\nMaid was not behind-hand with the Widow :\nShe rail'd against the Widow ; represented her\nas sometimes a Coquet, sometimes a Lady\nof Pleasure, sometimes a Jilt ; and lifted up\nher Hands in Wonder and Amazement, that\nUrbana should imagine so Rich a Man, as\nAlderman such a one should fall to her Lot.\nThus Urbana swore and protested, that Chri-\nstallina could never arrive at the Honour of\nbeing the Wife to the Courtly Secretarius, let\nMr. Campbell flatter her as he would : And\nChristallhia vow'd, that Campbell must be a\ndownright Wizard, if he foretold, that such\na one as Urbana would get Alderman Stiff-\nrump\n\fos Mr. Duncan Campbell 14$*\nrump for a husband, provided a Thing so im\nprobable should come to pass.\nHowever, it seems, Duncan had told them\ntheir own names, and the Names of their\nSuiters ; and told them farther, how soon\nthey were both to be married, and that too,\ndirectly to their Hearts Content ; as they said\nrejoicingly to themselves * and made their\nmutual Gratulations.\nThey went away, each satisfied that she\nshould have her own Lover ; but ChristaUina\nJaugh'd at Mr. Campbell, for assigning the Al\nderman to Urbana ; and Urbana laugh d at\nhim, for promising the Courtier to the Arms\nof Christallina.\nThis is a pretty good Figure of the Tern-'\npers of Twb feigning Toasts, with regard to\none another.\nFirst, Their Curiosity made them j from\nresolving to be concealed, discover one ano\nther wilfully ; from utter strangers grow as\nfamiliar as old Friends in a Moment ; swear*\none another to Secrecy, and exchange the\nSentiments of their Hearts together, and from\nbeing Friends, become envious of each other's\nenjoying a Similitude of Happiness, The\nCompliments made on either Side, Face to\nFice, were, upon the turning of the Back,\nturn'd into reflections, Detraction and Ridi\ncule : Each was a Self-Lover, and admirer\nof her own Beauty and Merit i and a Despi-\nfer of the other's.\nL How^\n\f\u2022\n\\^6 The Life ^-\/Adventures\nHowever , Duncan Campbell prov'd at left\nto be in the right : Urbana was wrong in her\nOpinion of Chrijlallinds want of Power over\nSecretarhu ; and Chri\/lallina was as much out\nin her Opinion, that Urbana would miss in\nher Aim of obtaining Stiffrttmp : For they\nboth prov'd in the right of what they thought,\nwith regard to their own dear single Persons,\nand were made happy according to their Ex\npectations, just at the time foretold by Mr.\nCampbell.\nChrijlallinas ill Wishes did not hinder Ur\nbana from being Mistress- of Alderman Stiff-\nrumps Persons and Stock ; nor did Urbana's\nhinder Chriflatiina from mewing her self a\nmining Bride at the Ring, in Secretarhiss gild\ned Chariot, drawn by Six Praneers of the\nproud Belgian Kind, with her Half Dozen of\nliveries, with Favours in their Hats, waiting\nher Return at the Gate of Hide-Park.\nBoth lov'd, and both envy'd ; but both al-\nlOw'd of Mr. Campbell's Foreknowledge.\nHaving told you Two very sorrowful Pas\nsages, and one tolerably successful and enter\ntaining ; I shall now relate to you another of\nmy own Knowledge, that is mixed up with\nthe Grievous and the pleasant, and chequerd,\nas it were, with the Shade and the Sunshine\nof Fortune.\n'Though there are Vicissitudes in every\nStage of Life under the Sun ; and not one\never ran continually on with the fame Series\nof\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell. 147\nof Prosperity ; yet those conditions, which\nare the most liable to the signal alterations of\nFortune, are the Conditions of Merchants :\nFor profese'd Gamesters I reckon, in a man\nner, as men of no Condition of Life at all, but\nwhat comes under the Statute of Vagabonds.\nIt was indeed, as the Reader would guess*\na worthy and a wealthy merchant, who was\nto run thro1 these different Circumstances of\nBeing : He came and visited our Mr. Camp'\ns, in the Year 1707 : He found him amidst\na Crowd of Consulters ?and being very ea-<\nger and solicitous to know his own Fortune*\njust at that criticaljuncture ofTime, hebegg'd\nof him, if possible, to adjournltisother Clients\nto the Day following, and sacrifice that one\nwholly to his Life ; which, as it was probably\nmore important than all the others together,\nso he wrote down, that he' would render the\nTime spent about it more advantageous to\nMr. Campbell ; and, by \"way of previous En\ncouragement, threw him down Ten Guineas,*\nas a retaining Fee.\nMr. Campbell, who held Money in very\nlit\ntle Esteem, and valued\nit\nso\nmuch too little,\nthat he has often had my Reprehensions on.\nthat Head, paused\na\nlittle\n;\nand after looking\nearnestly\nin\nthe Gentleman\ns\nFace, and read\ning there, as\nI\nsuppose,\nin\nthat little Space of\nTime\nin\ngeneral, (according to the Power of\nthe Second Sight) that what concerned him\nwas highly momentous\n;\nwrote him this An-\nL\n1\nswer\n5\n\f148 The Life and Adventures\nswer j \" That he would comply with his\n\" Requests, adjourn his other clients to the\n\" Day following, and set apart all the Rem-\n\" nant of that, till Night, for inspecting the\n\" future Occurrences, of which he had a\n\" Mind to be made a Master,\n. There is certainly a very keen Appetite in\nCuriosity ; it cannot stay for Satisfaction ; it\nis pressing for its necessary Repast, and is with\nout all Patience. Hunger and Thirst are not\nAppetites more vehement, and more hard and\ndifficult to be repreft'd, than that of Curiosi\nty : Nothing but the present NOW is able to\nallay it. A more expressive picture of this I\nnever beheld, than in the Faces of some, and\nthe Murmurs and Complaints of others, in\nthat little inquisitive Company, when the\nunwelcome Note was given about, signifying\nan Adjournment for only Twenty four Hours.\nThe Colour of a young Woman there came\nand went a Hundred times (if possible in the\nSpace of two Minutes : She blufh'd like a\nred Rose this Moment ; and in the Switch of\nan Eyelash, me was all over as pale as a white\none. The Suiter, whose Name her Heart\nhad gone pit-a-pat for the Space of an Hour,\nto be informed of from the Pen of a Seer, was\nnow deferr'd a whole Day longer ; The was\nonce or twice within an Ace of swooning\naway ; but he comforted her in particular, by\ntelling her, (tho' he said it only by way of\nJest)\n>\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 149\njest) that the Day following would be a more\nlucky day to consult about Husbands , than\nthe present that she came on. The Answer\nwas a kind of Cordial to her Hopes, and\nbrought her a little better to her self.\nTwo others, I remember, Sisters and old\nMaids, that it seems were Misers, Women\nordinarily dresi'd, and in blue Aprons, and yet\n(\"by Relation) worth no less than Two Thou\nsand Pounds each, were in a Peck of Troubles\nabout his going and leaving them unsatisfied.\nThey came upon an Enquiry after goods that\nwere stolen j and they complained, that by\nnext morning, at that Time, the Thief might\nbe got far enough off,\" and creep into so re\nmote a Corner, that he would put it beyond\nthe Power of the Devil, and the Art of Con\njuration to find him out, and bring him back\nagain. The Disturbance and Anxiety that\nwas to be seen in their Countenances, was\njust like that which is to be beheld in the\nFace of a losing Gamester, when hfs All, his\nlast great Stake lies upon the Table, and is\njust sweeping off by another winning Hand,\ninto his own Hat.\nThe next was a Widow j who bounc'd, be\ncause, as she pretended, he would not tell\nher what was best to do with her Sons ; and\nwhat profession it would be most happy for\nthem to be put to : But in Reality, all the\nCause of the Widow's fuming and fretting,\nwas, not that she wanted to provide for her\nL 3 sons\n\f150 The Life and Adv entures\nSons, but for her self : She wanted a Second\nHusband ; and was not half so solicitous about\nbeing put in a way of Educating those Chil-r\ndren flie had already, as of knowing when\nshe should be in a Likelihood of getting more.\nThis was certainly in her Thoughts ; or else\nHi\u00a3 would never have flouncd about in her\nWeed from one End of the Room to the\nother, and all the while of her passion, smile\nby Fits upon the Merchant, and leer upon a\nyoung pretty Irijh Fellow that was there.\nThe young Irishman made use of a little Eye-\nLanguage : She grew appeas'd ; went away in\nquite a good Humour ; skuttlcd too airily down\nStairs, for a Woman in her Cloaths ; and the\nReason was certainly, that (he knew the Mat\nter before, which we took notice of presently-\nafter. The Irishman went precipitately after\nher down Stairs, without taking his Leave.\nBut neither were the Two Misers for their\nGold, the Virgin for a first Husband, nor the\nWidow for a Second, half so eager, as ano\nther married Woman there was for the Death\nof her Spouse. She had put the question in\nso expecting a manner for a lucky Answer,\nand with so much keen Desire appearing plain\nly in her Looks , that no big-belly'd Woman\nwas ever more, eager for devouring Fruit ;\nno young hasty Bridegroom, just married to\na beauty, more impatient for Night and En\njoyment, than (he was to. know, what she\nthought a mere happy moment, the Moment\n\fos Mr. Duncan Campb ell 15-1\nof her husband's last agonizing Gasp. As her\nexpectation was the greatest, so was her Dis\nappointment too, and consequently her Dis\norder upon his going and leaving her unre-\nsolv'd. She was frantick, raging and impla\ncable : She was in such a Fury at the Delay of\nputting off her Answer to the Day following,\nthat in her fury she acted as if she would have\ngiven her self an Answer, which of the Two\nshould die first, by choaking her self upon the\nSpot, with the Indignation that swelfd in her\nStomach, and rese into her Throat on that Oc\ncasion. It may look like a Romance to lay it ;\nbut indeed they were forc'd to cut her Lace ;\nand then she threw out of the Room with\ngreat Passion\u2014But yet had so much of the\nenraged Wife left, ( beyond the enrag'd Wo\nman) as to return instantly up Stairs, and\nsignify very calmly, she would be certain to\nbe there next Day ; and beseech'd earnestly,\nthat they might not meet with a Second Dis\nappointment.\nAll this Hurry and Bustle created a Stay, a\nlittle too tedious for the Merchant ; who be\ngan to be impatient himself, especially when\nWord was brought up, that a fresh Company\nwas come in : But Mr. Campbell was deny'd\nto them ; and to put a Stop to any more In\nterruptions, the Merchant and the Dumb\nGentleman agreed to flip into a Coach, drive\nto a Tavern in the City, and settle Matters of\nFuturity over a Bottle of French Claret.\nL 4 The\n\frx$i The Life and Adventures\nThe first Thing done at the Tavern, was;\nMr\/ Campbell's saluting him upon a Piece of\nPaper by his Name, and drinking his Health.\nThe next Paper held a Discourse of Condo-\nlance, for a Disaster that was past long since ;\nnamely, a great and considerable Loss that hap\npens to his Family, in the dreadful Conga\ngration of the City of London. In the Third\nLittle Dialogue which they had together, he\ntold the Merchant, that Lodes and Advan\ntages were general Topicks, which a Person\nunskill'd in that Art might venture to assign\nto any Man of his profession ; it being next to\nimpossible, that Persons who traflick. should\nnot sometimes gain , and sometimes lose. \u2014\nBut, said Mr. Duncan Campbell, I will sketch\nout particularly, and specify to you some fu\nture Misfortunes, with which you will una\nvoidably meet : 'Tis in your Stars ; it is in\nDestiny, that you should have some Trials ;\nand therefore when you are forewarn'd, take\na prudent Care to be forearm 'd with Patience j\nand by Longanimity, and meekly and resign\nedly enduring your Lot, render it more easy,\nsince Impatience can't avert\nit,\nand will only\nrender\nit\nmore burthensome and heavy. He\ngave these Words to the Merchant\n;\nwho\npress\nd\nfor his Opinion that Moment. By\nyour Leave, (\"resuming the Pen, said the Dumb\nGentleman in writing we will have this\nBottle out first, and tap\na\nfresh one, that you\nmay be warm'd with Courage enough to re^\n\u2022\n<\nceive\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell \"*n\nceive the first speculative Onset of ill Fortune,\nthat I shall predict to you, with a good Grace ;\nand that may perhaps enable you to meet\nit,\nwhen\nit\ncomes to reduce\nit\nself into action,\nwith a\nmanful Purpose, and all-becoming Re-\nsolution. The Merchant agreed to the Pro\nposal, and put on an Air of the careless and\nin\ndifferent as well as he could\n;\nto signify, that he\nhad no need to raise up an artificial Courage\nfrom the auxiliary Forces of the Grape. But\nNature, when hard pressed, will break thro' all\nDisguises\n;\nand not only, notwithstanding the\nAir of pleasantry he gave himself, which ap-\npear'd forc'd and constraint, but in Spite of\ntwo or three sparkling and enlivening Bum\npers,\na\nCloud of Care would ever and anon\ngather and shoot heavily cross his Brow, tho'\nhe labour'd all he could to dispel\nit\nas quick\nly\n,\nand to keep fair Weather in his Counte\nnance. Well\nj\nthey had crack'd the first Bot\ntle, and the Second succeeded upon the Table,\nand they call'd to blow\na\nPipe together. This\nPipe Mr. Campbell found had\na\nvery\nill\neffect\n:\n\\\nIt\nis\ncertainly\na\npensive kind ofinstrument, and\nfills\na\nMind any thing\nso\ndisposed, with disturb\ning Thoughts, black Fumes, and melancholy\nVapours, as certainly as\nit\ndoth the Mouth\nwith Smoke. It plainly took away even the lit\ntle Sparks of Vivacity, which the Wine had\ngiven before\n;\nso\nhe wrote for\na\nTruce of Fi\nring those Sort of noxious Guns any longer\n;\nand they laid down their Arms\nby\nConsent, and\ndrank\n\fif4 The Ljp\u00a3 and Adventures\ndrank off\" the Second Bottle. A Third im\nmediately supply'd its Place ; and at the first\nGlass of the opening of the Bottle, Mr. Camp\nbell began to open to him his future Cafe, in the\nfollowing Words :\n*\nSir, You have now some\n*\u25a0\nVentures at Sea, from such and such a Place,\n*\nto such a Value : Don't be discomforted at the\nNews which you certainly will have within\nthree Months, (but 'twill be false at last) that\nthey are by three differentTempests madethe\nPrey of the great Ocean, and enrich the Bot\ntom ofthe Sea, the Palace ofNeptwie. A worse\nStorm than all these attends you at home ; a\nWife who is,and will be more the Tempest of\nthe House wherein (he lives. The high and\nlofty Winds of her Vanity, will blow down\nthe Pillars of your House and Family ; the\nHigh-tide of her Extravagance, will roll on\nlike a resistless Torrent, and leave you at low\nWater, and the Ebb of all your Fortunes.\nThis is the highest,and the most cutting Di\nsaster that is to befal you. Your real Ship\nwreck is not foreign, but domestick ; your\nBosom-Friend is to be your greatest Foe, and\neven your powerful Undoer for a Time. Mark\nwhat I fay, and take Courage ; it shall be but\nfor a Time, provided you take Courage. It\nwill, upon that Condition, be only a stiort and\nwholsome Taste of Adversity given to you,\nthat you may relish returning Prosperity with\nVirtue, and with a greater Return ofThanks\nto him that dispenses it at Pleasure to Man-\n' kind.\n\fos Mr. Dun can Campbell 15 $\nc\nkind. Remember, Courage and Resignation\n' is what I advise you to ; use it (as becomes\ne\nyou) in your Adversity ; and believe, that as\n' I foretold that Adversity, so I can foretel, a\n'\nProsperity will again be the Consequence of\n4\nthose Virtues ; and the more you feel the one,\n'\nought not to cast you down, but raise your\n*\nHopes the more, that he who foretold you\n*\nthat so exactly, could likewise foretel you the\n*\nother.' The Merchant was by this put into\na great Suspense of Mind ; but somewhat bee\nsier, by the Second Prediction being annex'd\nso kindly to the first fatal one. They crown'd\nthe Night with a Flask of Burgundy ; and then\nparting, each went to their respective Homes.\nThe Reader may perchance wonder, how I,\nwho make no mention of my being there, (as\nin Truth I was not at the Tavern I should be\nable to relate this as of my own Knowledge ;\nbut if he pleases to have Patience to the End\nof the Story, he will have entire Satisfaction\nin that Point.\nAbout Half a Year after, the Merchant came\nagain , told him that his prediction was too\nfar verify\n'd,\nto his very dear Cost\n;\nand that\nhe was now utterly undone, and beyond any\nvisible Means of\na\nfuture Recovery\n;\nand doubt\ning lest the other fortunate Part of the Pre\ndiction was only told him by way of Encou\nragement,\n(\nfor groundless Doubts and Fears\nalways attend\na\nMind implung'd\nin\nMelan\ncholy\ns\"\n)\nbesought him very earnestly to tell\nhim\n\f\\$6 TbeLir*. and Adventures\nhim candidly and sincerely , if there was no\nreal prospect of Good, and rid him at once\nof the uneasiness of such a Suspension of\nThought : But pray, too, said' he, with all\nthe Vehemence of repeated Expostulation, sa\ntisfy me, if there are any farther Hopes on\nthis side the Grave ?\nTo this, Duncan Campbell made a short, but\na very significant Reply in Writing. 'May the\n*\nHeavens preserve you from a threatningDan-\n*\nger of Life. Take care only of your self j\n*\ngreat and mighty Care ; and if you outlive\n*\nFriday next, you will yet be great, and more\n*\nfortunate than ever you was , in all the\n*\nHeight of your former most flourishing Space\n*\nof Life.' He colour'd inordinately, when Dun\ncan Campbell said Friday ; and conjur'd him to\ntell him as particularly as he could, what he\nmeant by Friday\n.<?\nHe told him, he could not\nparticularize any farther\n;\nbut that great Dan\nger thrcaten'd him that Day\n;\nand that with\nout extraordinary Precaution,\nit\nwould prove\nfatal to him, even to Death. He shook his\nHead, and went away in\na\nvery sorrowful\nPlight. Friday past, Saturday came\n;\nand on\nthat very Saturday Morning came likewise the\njoyful Tidings\n,\nthat what Ventures of his\nwere given over for lost at Sea\n,\nwere all\ncome safe into the Harbour. He came the\nMoment he receiv'd those Dispatches from his\nagent, to Mr. Duncan Campbell\nrs\nApartment,\nembrac'd him tenderly, and saluted him with\nmuch\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 157\nmuch Gladness of Heart, before a great Room\nfull of Ladies , where I happen 'd to be pre\nsent at that Time ; crying out in a loud\nVoice, before he knew what he aid, that\nMr. Campbell had sav'd his Life ; that Friday\nwas his Birth-day, and he had intended (with\na Pistol) to shoot himself that very Day. The\nLadies thought him mad ; and he, recover'd\nfrom his Extacy, said no more, but sat down,\ntill Mr. Campbell dismise'd all his Clients ; and\nthen we Three went to the Tavern together,\nwhere he told me the whole little history, or\nnarrative, just as is above related.\nThe Fame which Mr. Duncan Campbell got\nby the foregoing, and several other Predicti\nons of the like kind, was become very large\nand extensive, and had spread it self into the\nremotest Corners of this Metropolis. The\nSquares rung with it ; it was whisper d from\none House to another, thro' the more magni\nficent Streets, where Persons of Quality and\nDistinction reside ; it catch'd every House in\nthe City ; like the News of Stock from Ex-\nchange-Alley^ it run noisily thro' the Lanes\nand little Thoroughfares where the Poor in\nhabit : It was the Chat of the Tea-Table, and\nthe Babble of the Streets ; and the whole\nTown, from the Top to the Bottom, was full\nof it. Whenever any Reputation rises to 2'\nDegree like this, let it be for what Art or Ac\ncomplishment, or on what Account soever it\nwill ,* Malice, Envy and Detraction, are sure\nto\n\fi$% 77?* Life and Adventures\nto be the immediate Pursuers of it with firii\nMouth, and to hunt it down, if possible, with\nfull Cry. Evert the great Nostradamus, tho'\nfavour d by Kings and Queens, (which always\nwithout any other Reason creates Enemies)\nwas not more pursued by Envy and Detra\nction, for his Predictions in Paris, and through\nout France , than' our Duncan Campbell was\nus London, and even throughout England.\nVarious, different, and many were the Ob\njections rais'd, to blot his Character, and ex\ntenuate his Fame ; that, when one was con\nfuted, another might not be wanting to sup\nply its Place j and so maintain a Course and\nSeries of back-biting, according to the known\nMaxim,\u2014 Throw Dirt, and ifit does notstick,\nthrow Dirt continually, and some willstick.\nNeither is there any wonder ; for a Mart\nthat has got Applauders of all Sorts and Con\nditions, must expect Condemners and Detra\nctors of all Sorts and Conditions likewise. If\na Lady of high Degree, for Example, should\nfey, smiling, (tho really thinking absolute-'\nly what flie says) for fear of being thought\nover-credulous :\u2014\u00a3\nWell, I vow, some Things\n*\u2022\nMr. Campbell does, are surprizing, after all ;\n*\nthey would be apt to incline one to a Belief,\n*\nthat he is a Wonder of a Man, for one would\n'imagine the Things he does impossible \u2014Why\"\nthen a Prude, with an assumed, supercilious'\nAir, and a scornful Tehee, would, in order to4\nseem more wise than she was* reply,\nc\nLard,\n'\nMadam,\n\fof Mn Duncan Campbell: \"159\n*\nMadam, 'tis more a Wonder to me, that you\n*\ncan be imposed upon so.\u2014I vow to gad-,\n*\nMadam, Iwould as soon consult an Almanack?\n' Maker, and pin my Faith upon what he pricks .\n*\ndown ; or believe like my Creed, in the Cross\n*\nwhich I make upon the Hand of a Gypsie.\u2014*\n1\nLard, Madam, I assure your ladyship he knows,\n*\nno more than I do of you,\u2014I aslure you' so,\n' and therefore believe me.\u2014 He- has; it all by\n1\nHearsay'\u2014If the Lady that believ'dit, should\nreply, 'That if he had notice of every Strange\n*\nby Hearsay, he must be a greater Man than\n' she suspected, and must keep more Spies in\n' Pay than a Prime. Minister :' TheP\/We's\nAnswer would be with a loud Laugh, and gig^\ngling out these Words : \u2014*\nLard, Madam, I\n' assure you, nothing can be more easy ; and sa\n*\ntake it for granted.' Because she was inclin'd\nto fay so, and had the Art of Wisdom on her\nside, forsooth, that she appear d hard of Be\nlief, ( which some call hard to be put upon-}\nand the other Lady credulous, fwhich some,\ntho' believing upon good Grounds, are\ncall'd^) and so thought foolish ; the Prudes\nAnswer would be thought sufficient and con\nvincing.\nThus Malice and Folly, by Dint of Noise\nand Impudence, and strong tho' empty As\nsertions, often run down Modesty and good\nSense. Among the common people it is the\nfame, but only done in a different manner.\nFor Example : An ordinary person, that had\n2 eon\n\f160 The Life and Adventures\nconsulted, might say, ( as he walk'd along J\nThere goes the Dumb Gentleman, who writes\ndown any Name of a Stranger at first Sight.\nSteps up a blunt Stranger , that takes Stub\nbornness for Sense, and says,\u2014 That is a con\nfounded Lye ; he is a Cheat and an impostor,\nand you are one of his accomplices. He'll\ntell me my Name, I suppose, if you tell it\nhim first. He is no more dumb than I am ;\nhe can speak and heat as well as us : I have\nbeen with those, that fay they have heard\nhim. I wish I and Two or Three more had\nhim in our stable ,\u2022 and I warrant you, with\nour Cartwhips, we would lick some Words\nout of his Chops, as dumb as you call him. \u2014\nI tell you, 'tis all a Lye, and all a Bite. \u2014If\nthe other desires to be convirlc'd for himself\nby his own Experience \u2014the rougher Rogue,\nwho perhaps has stronger Sinews than t'other^\nanswers, If you lye any farther, I will knock\nyou down : And so he is the vulgar wit and\nthe Mouth of the Rabble-Rout. And thus\nthe Detraction spreads below with very good\nSuccess, as it does above in another kind.\nAs there are Two Comical Adventures in\nhis Life, which directly suit and correspond\nwith the foregoing reflections, this seems the\nmost proper Place to insert them in. The\nfirst consists of a kind of Mob Way of Usage!\nhe met with from a Fellow, who got to be an\nOfficer in the Army, but by the following\nBehaviour, will be found unworthy of the\nName, and the Commission; Irt\n\fof Mr. Duncan-Gampbex-J.. i<>i\nIn.theYear 170 1, a Lady of good quality\ncame and address'd her self to him much after\nthe following manner. She told him she had\nChoice of Lovers, but preferr'd one above\nthe rest j but desired to know his Name, and\nif she made him her Choice, what would be\nthe subsequent Fate of such a Matrimony.\nMr. Duncan Campbell very readily gave her\ndown in Writing this plain and honest Re\nply ; that of all her Suiters she was most in-\nclin'd to a Captain, a distinguished Officer,\nand a great Beau, (\"naming his Name) and\none that had a great many outward engaging\n.Charms, sufficient to blind the Eyes of arty\nLady that was not thoroughly acquainted\nwith his Manner of living. He therefore as\nsured her, (and thought himself bound, be\ning conjured so to do, having received his\nFee, though there was Danger in such plain\nand open Predictions,) that he was a Villain\nand a Rogue in his Heart, a profligate Game\nster, and that if \/he took him to her Bed,\nfte would only embrace her own Ruin. The\nLady's Woman, who was present, being in Fee\nwith the Captain, resolving to give Intelli\ngence, for fear the Officer her so good Friend\nshould be disappointed in the Siege ; flily shuf\nfled the Papers into her Pocket, and made a\npresent of them to the military Spark. Fir'd\nwith indignation at the Contents, he vow'd\nrevenge ; and in order to compass\nit,\ncon\nspires with his Female Spy about the Means.\n\u2022'\nM In\n\f\\6z TbeLiTE and, Adventures\nIn sine, for fear of losing the Lady though\nhe quarrel d with Duncan Campbell, a Method\nwas to be found out how to secure her by the\nvery Act of Revenge. At last it was re-\nsol v'd to discover tq her, that he had found\nout what she had been told by Mr. Campbell,\nbut the Way how -he had been inform 'd\nwas to remain a Secret. He, did do so,\nand ended his Discovery with these. Words:\nJ desire, Madam, that if I prove him an Im\npostor, you would not believe, a Word, he\nfays. \u2014 The Lady agreed to so fair a Propo\nsal. Then the Captain swore that he. him\nself would never eat a Piece of Bread more\ntill he had made Mr. ..\u00a3mw^\/\/ eat tis Wprds.j\nnay he insisted upon\nit, that he would bring\nhim to his Tongue, and make him .own by\nWord of Mouth, that what he had written\nbefore was false and calumnious.\n,\nTo which\nthe Lady ansver'd again, that,\nif\nhe perform\n'd\nwhat he said she would be convinced. This\nbrave Military Man, however, not relying\nupon his qwn single Valour and prowess, to\nbring about\nso\nmiraculous\na\nThing as the mar\nking\na\nPerson that was dumb to speak\n;\nhe took\nwith him for this End three lusty Assistants to\ncombine1 with him in the Assassination. Th$\nAmbuscade was settled to be at tfye Kiye Bells\nTavern in Wnh-ftreet\nin\ntheStr^n^l.^ After\nthe Ambush was settled with\nso\nmuch false\nCourage, the Business of decoying Mr. Campbell\ninto\nit,\nwas not practicable any other way,\n\u2022\n\u2022\nthan\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell. i6j\n_\nthan by sending out false Colours. The La\ndy s Woman, who was by her own Interest\ntied fast to the Interest of the Beau, was to\nplay the Trick ofDalikb, and betray this deaf\nand dumb Sampson (as he will appear to be a\nkind of one in the Sequel of the Story) into\nthe Hands of these Philistines. She smooths\nher Face over with a complimenting Lye\nfrom her Mistress to Mr. Campbell ; and acted\n-her Part of Deceit so well that he promis'dto\nfollow her to the Five Bells with all haste j\nand so she skuttled back to prepare t-lie Cap\ntain, and to tell him how lucky she was in\nMischief ; and how she drew him out by\nSmiles into Perdition. The stiort of the Story\n>is, when they got him in among them, they\nEndeavour's! toaslasswatehim ;but they miss'd\nof their Aim ; yet 'tis certain they left him\nin a very terrible and bloody Condition ; and\nthe Captain .went away in as bad a Plight as\nthe Person was left in, whom. he aslaulted so\ncowardly with Numbers, and to such Disad\nvantage. I was sent for to him upon this\nDisaster, and the Story was deliver d to me\nthus, by one of the Drawers of the Tavern,\nwhen I enquir'd into it. They began to ban-\njter him j..and speaking to him as if he heard,\nask'dhimif he knew his own Fortune ; they\ntold him it svas to be beaten to Death. This\nwas ao odd. Way of addressing a deaf and\ndumb Man., They added they would m-ake\n-him speafc before they .-ha4 done. The Boy\nM z seeing\nJ\n\f1(^4 The Life and Advent ur.es\nseeing he made no Reply, but only smiled ;\nthought what pass'd between them was a Jest\nwith an old Acquaintance, and withdrew\nabout his Business. The Door being fasten\n'd,\nhowever, before they began the honourable\nAttack, they vouchsafed to write down their\nIntent\nin\nthe Words above-mentioned which\nthey had uttered before, to make sure that\nhe should understand their Meaning, and what\nthis odd way of Correction was for. All the\nwhile the Maid, who had brought him into\nit,\nwas peeping through\na\nHole, and watch\ning the Event, as appears afterwards. Mr.\nCampbell wrote them' the following Answer,\nvi&. that he'hop'd for fair Play\n;\nthat he un\nderstood Beargarden as well as they\n;\nbut\nif\na\nGentleman was amongst them, he would\nexpect Gentlemanly Usage. The Rejoinder\nthey made to this consisted,\nit\nfeeriis, riOt of\nWords but of Action.\n'\nThe Officer,\nin\nCon\njunction with another Ruffian, one of the\nstrongest of the Three he had brought, com\nmenced the Aflault. As good Luck would\nhave\nit,\nhe warded off their first Blows\n(it\nseems) with tolerable Success\n:\nand\na\nWine-\nQuart-Pot standing upon the Table, Duncan\ntook to his Arms, and at Two or Three quick\nBlows, well manag'd, and close laid in upon\nthe AslaiiantSjfell'd them both to the Ground.\nHere\nit\nwas that the Maid diseover'd her\nKnowledge of\nit,\nand Privity to the Plot, to\nthe whole House\nj\nfor she no sooner sees the\n.'\u2022*-\u25a0\u25a0\n\u25a0:\n;v' famous\n\fof Mr. Duncan CAmpb\u00a3li^ i6j\nfamous Leader, the valiant Captain, lie sprau-\nling on the Floor with bleeding Temples, but\nihe fhriek'dout, with all the Voice slie could\nexert, Murder, Murder, Murder ! Alarmed\nat this Out-cry, the Master and all the At\ntendants of the Tavern scamper 'd Up Stairs*\nburst into the room, and found Duncan Camp-\nhell struggling with the other Two, and the\nQuart-Pot still fast clenched in his hand*\nwhich they were endeavouring to wrench\nfrom him. The Drawers reseud him out of\ntheir hands, and enquir d into the Matter.\nThe maid in a Fright confess'd the whole\nThing. The Officer and his Associate rubb'd\ntheir Eyes, as recovering from a stunning-\nSleep, reefs as they went, to rife, paid the\nReckoning, and flunk pitifully away, (or as\nthe Rake's Term for it is*) they brufh'd of\u00a3\nand for all their odds had the worst of the\nLay. I who had some Authority with Mr;\nCampbell, by reason of my Years, and the strict\nAcquaintance I had with his mother, when\nI came and found him in that Pickle, and had\nthe whole Relation told me by the People of\nthe House, though I could not forbear pitying\nhim within my own Mind, took upon me to\nreprehend him, and told him that these Hard\nships would by Providence be daily permitted\nto fall upon him (for he met with them\nTwenty Times) while he continued in that\nirregular ^yay of Living and spending his\ntime, that might be so precious to hitfifelf,\nM 3 and\n\f166 The Life and Adv entures\nand many others, in Drunkenness and De\nbauchery ; and I think die Leslbns I wrote\ndown to him upon that Head, though a lit\ntle (evere just at that juncture, were out\nstanding well-tim'd, and did, as I guefe'd\nthey would, make a more solid impression in\nhim than at any other. In all these Scuffles\n(whether it is that being deaf and dumb, an\naffront works deeper upon a ManT and fe*\nrenders him far more fierce or resolute) it\nmust be said, that though Nature has been\nkind in making him very Strong, Robust,\nand Active withal, yet he has bore some\nShocks, one would imagine beyond the\nStrength of a Man, having sometimes got\nthe better of Five or Six Ruffians in Rencoun\nters of the like kind. ;\n\".'.\n.\nThe next Banter he met with was in\na\ngenteeler Way, from an 'unbelieving Lady, and\nyet she came off with very ill Success, and\nthe Banter turn\n\"d\nall upon herself in the end.\n:\n\u2022\nA\nLady of Distinction (whose Name shall\ntherefore be conceal'd in this Place\nJ)\ncame\nWith Two or Three of her special friends\nwho took her for the most merry innocent\nfootless Virgin upon Earth, and whose Mo\ndesty was never suspected in the least by her\nRelations or Servants that were nearest a\nbout her\n;\nafter having rally'd Mr. Campbell\nwith several frivolous Questions, doubting his\nCapacity, and vexing and teazing him with\ngay \u2022Impertirtencies beyond\nall\npatience, was\n-.:.-\n,\n'':\u2022\u00bb'\u2022\nby\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell. i6j\nby him told, that he did not fake Fees in hii\nProfession to be made a Jest oflike a commori\nFortune-teller, but to do real Good to those\nwho1 consulted him, as far as he was able by\nhis Predictions ; that he was treated with more\nRespect by Persons of a higher , Condition,\nthough her own was very good, and fo of-\nfer'd her Guinea back asain with a* Bow and\na Smile. She had a little more Generosity of\nSpirit than not to be a little nettfed it the\nProfrer she had caus'd by -fa course aft Cflage,\nShe affected appearing grave a little, arid told\nhim she would be serious for the future; and\nask'd him to set down he.r Name, . which fiie\nhad neglected before, to ask other Questions\nthat were nothing to the Purpose.

She was as serious in\nher dealings with him afterwards, and irn-\nproved by being so, as (he was gay and turbu\nlent with him before, and smarted for it. In\nfine, she was a thorough Convert, and a Vo\ntary of his ; and the only Jest she us'd after\nwards to make concerning him, was a Civil\nWitticism to his Wife ; to whom she was wontK\nevery now and then, smiling, to address her\nself after this manner :\n'\nYour Husband, Ma-\n' dam, is a Devil ; but he is a very hand-\n' some, and a very civil one.\nNot long after this came another Lady,\nwith a like Intent to impose upon him ; and\nwas resolv'd (as she own'd) to have laughed\nhim to scorn, if she had succeeded in her At\ntempt. She had very dextrously dress'd her\nself\n\f170 The Life and Adventures\nself in her Woman's Habit, and her Woman\nin her own ; her Footman squired the new-\nmade Lady in a very gentlemanly Dress, hir'd\nfor that Purpose of a Disguise from Monmouth-\nfireet. The strange and unknown Masquera-\nders enter'd Mr. Campbell's Room with much\nArt. The Fellow was by Nature of a clean\nMake, and had a good Look, and from fol\nlowing a genteel Master, when he was young,\nCopy a his Gait a little, and had some Appear\nance of a Mien, and a tolerable good Air\nabout him. But this being the first time of\nhis being so fine; and he a little vain in his\ntemper ; he over-acted his Part ; he strutted\ntoo much ; he was as fond of his ruffles, his\nWatch, his Sword, his cane, and his Snuffc;\nBox, as a Boy of being newly put into Breech-'\nes ,-ind view d them all too often to be thought\nthe Posleslbr ofany such Things long.The Veg\nctation of the Chambermaid was insufferable ;\nShe had the Toss of the Head, the jut of, the;\nBum, the side-long Leer of the eye, the impe\nrious Look upon her Lady,; now degraded in\nto her Woman, that she was intolerable, and\na Person without the Gift of tho Second-Sight,\nWould have guefs'd her to have been a prag\nmatical Upstart, tho' 'tis very probable, that\nduring that time, she fancy'd herself real\nly better than her Mistress: The Mistress\nacted her Part of Maid the best, for it is ea\nsier for genteel Modesty to act alowPartjthari\nfor affected Vanity to act a high one. She\nkeptt\n\fof Mr.DaNCAN Campbell iyv.\nkept her Distance like a Servant ; but would,\nto disguize Things the better, beiesery now\nand then part, according to their way, and\ngive occasion to be chid. But there is an*\nAir of Gentility, inborn and inbred to\nsome people ,\u2022 and even when they aim to be\nawkward, a certain Grace will attend all their\nminutest actions and gestures, and command\nlove, respect and veneration. ... I must there\nfore own, that there was not need of a Man's\nbeing a Conjurer, to guess who ought to be\nthe Lady, and who the Maid ; but to know\nwho absolutely was the Lady, and who was,\nthe Maid, did require that Skill. For how-\nmany such real Ladies have we, that are made\nso from such Upstarts >\nAnd how many gen\nteel Waiting-Women of great Descent, that\nare born with a grace about them , and are\nbred to good Manners 2 Mr. Campbell's Arc\nmade him positive in the Case : He took the\nPatches from the Face of the Maid, and plac'd\nthem on the Mistress's : He pull d off her Hood\nand Scarf, and gave it the Lady ; and taking\nfrom the Lady her Ridinghood, gave it the\nMaid in Exchange ,- for Ladies at that Time of\nDay, were not entered into that Fashion of\ncloaking themselves. Then he wrote down,\nthat he should go out, and ought to send his\nMaid in, to undress them quite, and give the\nMistress her own Cloaths, and the Maid hers\nelf\nand, with\na\nsmile, wrote down both their\nnames, and commended her contrivance. But\ncraub\n\u25a0'\u25a0\nafter\n\u2022.\n\fiyi TbeLivE arid AdventureS\nafter that, it was remark'd by the Lady, that\nhe paid her less respect than she expected,-\nand more to her Footman, who was in a Gen\ntleman's Habit ; whom he took aside, and\ntold a great many fine Things ; whereas he\nwould tell the Lady nothing farther. The\nLady, nettled at this, wrote to him, that she\nhad Vanity enough to believe, that (he might\nbe distinguifh'd from her Maid in any Dress ;\nbut that he had shown his want of Skill, in not\nknowing who that Gentleman was. Mr. Camp\nbell told her her Mistake in (harp Terms ; and\nbegging her Pardon, aslur'd her he knew se\nveral Chambermaids as genteel and as well\nborn as her, and many Mistresles more auk-\nward and worse-born than her Maid : Thatr\nhe did not go therefore by the Rule of Guess\nand Judging what ought to be; but by the\nRule of Certainty , and the Knowledge of\nwhat actually was. She, however, unsatisfy'd\nwith that Answer, perplex'd him mightily to\nknow, who the Man was. He answers he\nwould be a Great Man. \u2014The Lady laughed\nscornfully, and said, she wanted to know who;\nhe was, not what he would be. \u2014He an-\nswer'd again-\u2014 He was her footman ; but\nthat she would have a worse. \u2014She grew\nwarm, and desir'd to be inform'd, Why, since\nhe knew the fellow's condition he respected\nher so little, and him so much i And accus'cf\n'\nhim of want of practising manners, if he h.?\nnot want of Knowledge. Heanswer'd, \"fr\n\"r\n\fof AU.

There is the way of foretelling Death\nby a Cry, that they call Taifk, which feme\ncall a Wrath in the Low-land. They hear a\nloud Cry without Doors, exactly resembling\nthe Voice of some particular Person, whose\n.Death is foretold by it ; of which he gives a\nlate Instance, which happen d in the; Village\nRigg, in Skye-IJle. . ; , ';.;;\u201e.\u25a0\u2022\u25a0\u2022.\n12.

He gives an instance of\nthis in a Horse, in the Isle of Skye.\nThat Cows have the Second-Sight, appears\nfrom this ; That if a Woman milking a Cow,\nhappens to see a Vision by the Second-Sight,\nthe Core runs away in a great Fright at the\nlame Time, and will not be pacify 'd for some\nTime after.\nIn Reference to this, Paracelsus, Tom. 9.\nL. de Jrte pr\u0153fagd, writes thus :\n'\nHorses also\n*\nhave their Auguries ; who perceive, by their\n'\nSight and Smell, wandring Spirits, Witches\n' and Spe&res, and the like Things ; and Dogs\n*\nboth see and hear the fame.\nHere, in the next place, the Author an\nswers objections, that have lately been made\nagainst the Reality of the Second-Sight.\nFirst, It is objected, that these seers are\nVisionary and Melancholy People, who fancy\nthey see Things, that do not appear to them\nor any body else.\nHe answers ; The people of these Isies, and\nparticularly the seers, are very temperate,\nand their\" Diet is simple and moderate, in\nQuantity arid quality ; so' that their Brains\nare not, in all Probability, disorder'd by un\ndigested fumes of Meat or Drink. Both\nSexes are free from HyfterickHits, Convul\nsions, and several other Distempers of that\n\"'\u25a0\u25a0' N 3\n\u25a0\"\nSort\n\f181 The Life and Adventure*\nSort. There are^o Madmen among them,\nnor any instance of Self-Murthcn It is ob-\nferv'd among them, that a Man drunk, never\nhas a Vision of the Second-Sight ; and he that\nis a Visionary, would discover himself in other\nThings as well as in that. Nor are such as have\nthe Second-Sight, judgd to be Visionaries, by\nany of their Friends or Acquaintance-\nSecondly, It is objected, that there are none\namong the learned, able to oblige the world\nwith a satisfactory Account of these Visions ;\ntherefore they are not to be believed.\nHe answers ; If every Thing, of which the\nLearned are not able to give a satisfactory Ac\ncount, shall be condemn d as False and Impos\nsible, we shall find many other Things, gene\nrally believed, which must b&reje&edissuch.\nThirdly, It is objected, that the Seers are Im\npostors ; and the People, who believe them,\nare credulous, and easy to be impos'd upon.\nHe answers ; The Seers are generally illi\nterate and well-meaning People, and altoge\nther void of Design : Nor could he ever learn\nthat any of them made the least Gain of it ;\nneither is it reputable among them to have\nthat faculty. Beside, the People of the Isles\nare not so credulous as to believe an Impos\nsibility, before the Thing foretold be accom\nplish a ; but when it actually comes to pass,\nafterwards it is not in their Power to deny\nit,\nwithout offering Violence to their Senses and\nReason. Beside,\nif\nthe Seers were Deceiver sx\nr :\/ can\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 185\ncan it be reasonable to imagine, that all the\nIslanders, who have not the Second-Sight,\nshould combine together, and offer Violence\nto their Understandings and Senses, to force\nthemselves to believe a Lye from Age to Age I.\nThere are several Persons among them, whose\nBirth and Education raise them above the\nSuspicion of concurring with an Imposture,.\nmerely to gratify an illiterate and contempti\nble Sort of Persons. Nor can a reasonable\nMan believe, that Children, Horses and Cows9\ncould be engaged in a combination, to per\nsuade the World of the reality of a Second-\nSight.\nEvery Vision that is seen, comes exactly\nto pass according to the Rules of Observati\non ; tho' Novices, and heedless Persons, can\nnot always judge by those Rules : Concern\ning which he gives instances.\nThere are Visions seen by several persons,\nin whose Days they are not accomplifli'd j\nand this is one of the reasons, why some\nThings have been seen, that are said never to\nhave come to pass ; and there are also several\nVisions seen, which are not understood till\nthey are accomplifli'd.\n'\nThe Second-Sight is not a late Discovery,\nseen by one or two in a Corner, or a remote\nIsle ; but it is seen by many Persons of both\nSexes, in several rifles, separated about Forty\nor Fifty Leagues from one another. The In\nhabitants of many of these Isles never had\nN 4 the\n\f'184 The Life and Adventur es\nthe least Converse by Word or Writing. And\nthis Faculty of feeing Visions having conti\nnued, as we are inform 'd by Tradition, ever\nsince the Plantation of these Istes, without\nbeing disproved by the nicest Sceptick, after\nthe strictest Enquiry, seems to be a clear Proof\nof- its Reality.\nIt is observable, that it was much more\ncommon Twenty or Thirty Years ago, than\nat present ; for One in Ten does not fee it\nnow, that (aw it then. - :\nThe Second-Sight is not confin'd to the We\nstern Isles alone ; the Author having an Ac\ncount that it is in several Parts of Holland, but\nparticularly in Bommel, where a Woman has\nit, for which she is courted \u25a0\nby some , and\ndreaded by others.\n;\nShe fees a Smoak about\none's Face, which is the Fore-runner of the\nDeath of a Person so seen ; and ihe actually\nforetold the Deaths of several that lived there.\nShe was living in that Town a few Winters\nago. L : . \u25a0 -;.-.. . ;\nThe Second-Sight is likewise in the Isle of\nMan, as appears by this Instance : Captairi\nLeathes, the Chief Commander of Belfast, in\nhis Voyage 1690, lost Thirteen Men by a vio*\nlent Storm ; and upon his Landing in the IJle\nof Man, an ancient Man, Glerk to a Panflt\nthere, told him immediately that he had lost\nThirteen Men there. The Captain enquir'd,\nhow he came'to the Knowledge of that ? He\nanswer'd, that it was by Thirteen Lights, which\n\\ \"'. he\n\fpf Mr. Duncan Gamp be l i- ji&f\nJie had seen come into the Churchyard ; as\nMr. Sacheverell tells us, in his late Descripti\non of the -Isle of Man. Note , That this is\nlike the Sight of the Corpse-Candles in Wales,\nwhich is also well attested. 'r'\n\u25a0 '\nHere the author adds many other instances\nconcerning the Second- Sight, of which I shall\nset down only zfeiv.\nA Man in Knockow, in St. Mary's Pari\/n,\n(the Northernmost Part of Skye') being in\nperfect Health, and sitting with his Fellow-\nServants at night, was on a sudden taken\nill, dropp'd from his Seat backward, and then\nfell a vomiting ,\u2022 at which the Family was\nmuch concern'd, he having never been subject\nto the like before ;but he came to himself soon\nafter, and had no Sort of Pain about him.\nOne of the Family, who was accustomed to\nseethe Second-Sight, told them, that the Man's\nIllness proceeded from a very strange Causes\nwhich was thus' : An ill-natur'd Woman\n(whom he named) who lives in the next adja\ncent Village of Bornskittag, came before him\nin a very* angry and furious Manner ; her\ncountenance full of passion, and her Mouth\nfull of reproaches j and threaten'd him with\nher Head and Hands, till he fell over, as you\nhave seen him. This woman had a Fancy\nfor the man, but was like to be disappointed\nas to her marrying of him. This instance\nwas told the Author, by the Master of the\nv -\nl .:\u2014 w' Fami\n\f1S6 The Life and Adventures\nfamily, and others, who were present when\nit happened.\nSir Norman Maeklead, and some others,\nplaying at tables, at a Game called in frisk\nFalmermore ; wherein there are Three of a\nSide, and each of them throw the Dice by\nturns ; there happend to be one difficult Point\nin the disposing of one of the Table-men. This\nobliged the Gamester to deliberate, before he\nwas to change his Man ; since, upon the dis\nposing of\nit,\nthe winning or losing of the Game\ndepended. At length the butler, who stood\nbehind, advised the Player where to place\nthe Man, with which he comply\nd,\nand won\nthe Game. This being thought extraordi\nnary, and Sir Norman hearing one whisper\nhim\nin\nthe Ear, ask'd who adyis'd him so\nskilfully\ni\nHe answer'd,\nit\nwas the Butler\n;\nbut\nthis seemed more strange, for\nit\nwas generally\nthought he could not play at Tables. Upon\nthis, Sir Norman ask'd him, how long\nit\nwas\nsince he had learn'd to play\n?\nAnd the Fellow\nown'd, that he had never play'd in his Life;\nbut that he saw the Spirit Browne\n(a\nSpirit\nusually seen\nin\nthat Country) reaching his\nArm over the Players Head, and touching the\nPart with his Finger, where the Table-man was\nto be placed. This was told the Author by\nSir Norman, and others, who happened to be\npresent at the time.\nDaniel Bow, alias Black, an Inhabitant of\nBomfkittag, who\nis\none of the precisest Seers\nin\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbill. ^7\nin the Isles, foretold the Death of a Young\nWoman in Minginis, within less than Twenty\nfour Hours before the Time ; and accordingly\nthe died suddenly in the Fields ; tho' at the\nTime of the prediction, she was in perfect\nHealth : But the Shroud appearing close about\nher Head, was the Ground of his Confidence\nthat her Death was at Hand.\nThe fame Person foretold the Death of a\nChild in his Master's Arms, by seeing a Spark\nof Fire fall on his Left Arm ; and this was like\nwise accomplifh'd soon after the prediction.\nSome of the Inhabitants of Harries failing\nround the JJle of Skye, with a Design to go to\nthe opposite Main-Land, were strangely sur\nprized with an Apparition of Two Men,\nhanging down by the Ropes that secur'd the\nMast, but could not conjecture what it meant.\nThey pursued their Voyage ; but the Wind\nturning contrary, they were forced into broad\ner, in the line of Skye, where they found\nSir Donald Mackdonald keeping a Sheriffs\nCourt, and two Criminals receiving Sentence\nof Death there^ The Ropes and Mast of\nthat very Boat, ,were made use of to hang\nthose Criminals. This was told the Author\nby several, who had this instance related to\nthem by the Boat's- Crew.\nSeveral Persons, living in a certain Fami\nly, told the Author, that they had frequently\nseen Two Men standing at a Gentlewoman s\nLeft Hand, who was their Master's Daughter :\nv \u25a0'' Sou\nthey\n\f}$% The Life and Adventures\nthey told the Men's Names, and being her\nequals, it was not doubted but she would be\nmarry 'd to one of them ; and perhaps to the\nother after the Death of the first. Some time\nafter a Third Man appeared, who seemed\nalways to stand nearest to her of the Three,\nbut the seers did not know him, though they\ncould describe him exactly ; and within some\nMonths after, this Man, who was seen last,\nactually came to the House, and fully an-\nswer'd the Description given of him, by those,\nwho never saw him but in a Vision ; and he\nmarry 'd the Woman shortly after : They live\nin the TJle of Skye, and both themselves and\nothers confirmed the truth of this instance,\nwhen the Author sew them.\nArchibald Mac Donald, of the Parish of St.\nMary's in the JJle of Skye, being reputed fa\nmous in his Skill of foretelling Things to come\nby the Second-Sight, happening to be in the\nVillage Ktwckow one night, and before Sup\nper, told the Family, that he had just then\nseen the strangest Thing he ever saw in his\nLife : viz. A man with an ugly long Cap,\nalways making his Head ; but that the strangest\nof all was a little kind of an Harp, which he\nhad with Four Strings only, and that it had\nTwo Harts-horns fix d in the Front of it : All\nthat heard this odd Vision fell a laughing at\nArchibald, telling him, that he was dreaming,\nor had not his Wits about him, since he pr<&.'\ntended to fee a Thing which had no being,\nand\n\fof Mr. Duncan-Campbell 1S9\nand was not so much as heard of in any part\nof the World. All this could not alter Archi\nbald's Opinion, who told them, that they must\nexcuse him if he laugh'd at them, after this\nAccomplishment of the Vision. Archibald re\nturned to his own House, and within Three\nor Four days after, a Man with cap, Harp,\n&c. came to the House, and the Harp, Strings,\nHorns, and Cap, answer'd the Description of\nthem at first View, and he (hook, his Head\nwhen he play'd ; for he had two Bells fix'd\nto his Cap. This Harper was a poor man,\nwho made himself a Buffopfl.;(fpr his Bread,\nand was never seen before in ifopfe Parts, and\nat the Time of the Prediction he was in the\nrifle of Barray, which is'about twenty leagues\ndistant from that Part of Skye. This Rela\ntion is vouch'd by Mr. Daniel Maneq and all\nhis family, and such as were then present,\nand they live in the. village-, where this hap7\npened. \u2022 ,v- \u25a0\u25a0\n-'.-. \u25a0;\u2022\u2022\n\u2022\u2022\n. \u25a0;-.i -;.;'L_. _ *\nOne Daniel Nicholson, Minister of St. Ma-}\nrys in Skyey the- parish in , which ever Archi\nbald Mac Donald lived, told the author ; that,\none Sunday, after Sermon, at {he Chapel\nVge, he took an occasion to enquire of Archi\nbald, if he still retain'd that unhappy faculty\nof seeing the Second-Sight, and wisli'd, him to\nget rid of\nit,\nif\npossible\n;\nfor, said*he,\nit\nis\nno\ntrue character of\na\ngood man: Archibald was\nhighly displeased, and answered that, he hoped\nhe was no more unhappy than his-Neighbours,\n.-*\"\n..\nfor\n\fi$6 TheLiTE and Adventures\nfor seeing what they could not perceive.

But\nI\nshall hereafter jhow, that thii\nOpinion cannot be entirely true.\nSir Norman Mac-Lead, who has his RelP\ndence\nin\nthe Isle of Bernera, which lies be\ntween the Isles of N.

One os'\n2\nhis\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell\" 191\nhis Fellow-Servants answer'd, that there was\nvery little Likelihopd of that, because of the\nDarkness of the Night, and the Danger of\ncoming thro' the Rocks, that lie round the\nIfie : But within an Hour after, one of Sir\nNormans Men came to the House, bidding\nthem provide Lights, &c. for his Mailer had\nnewly landed.\nSir Norman being told of this, called for\nthe Seer, and examin'd him about it. He an\nswer'd, that he had seen the Spirit Browne,\nin human Shape, come several Times, and\nmake a Show of carrying an old Woman (that\nfat by the Fire) to the Door ; and at last\nseem'd to carry her out by Neck and Heels ;\nwhich made him laugh heartily, and gave Oc\ncasion to the rest to conclude him Mad, to\nlaugh so much without any Reason. This\nInstance was told the Author, by Sir Normart\nhimself.\nFour Men from the Isle of Skye and Harries\nwent toBarbadves, and stay 'dthere some Years;\nWho, tho' they had wont to see the Second*\nSight in their native Country, never saw it in\nBarbadoes ; but upon their Return to England^\nthe first Night after their Landing, they saw\nthe Second-Sight ; as the Author was told bj*\nseveral of their Acquaintance. .\nJohn Morrison, who lives in Bernera of Har\nries, wears the Plant called Fuga D\u0153monum,\nsewed in the Neck of his Coat, to prevent\nhis seeing of Visions j and fays, he never law\nany\n*\n\u2022\n\f'191 The Life and Adventures\nany since he first carried that Plant about\nhim. ,;'\u25a0?\u25a0.\n\u2022 \u25a0\n. \u2022.....:\u2022.\nA Spirit;' by' the Country People called\n\u25a0Brownie, was frequently seen in all the most\nconsiderable Families in the Ifles; and North\nof Scotland rj in the Shape of a tall Man, having\nvery long brown Hair : Bat within these\nTwenty Years past he has been seen but\nrarely. ,.:'.!\nThere were Spirits also that .appeared in\nthe shape of Women, Horses; Swiries, Cats;\nand some like fiery Balls, which would sol-1\nlow Men in ther- Fields, but there have been\nbut few Instances of these for upwards of\nForty Years past.' . . :; .> i-v v-.'-f , > \u2022\n'. .'\u2022: ':\nThese Spirits us'd also to \u25a0\nform Sounds in\nthe Air, resembling those of an Harp, Pipes^\ncrowing of a Cock, and of the grinding of\nHand-mills: And sometimes Voices have been\nheard in the Air at Night, singing Irish Songs ;\nthe Words of which Songs some of the Au\nthors Acquaintances still retain ; one of them\nresembled the Voice of a Woman, who died\nsome time before, and the Song related to her,\nState in the other World.

Mr. Baxter's Book concerning the Cer\ntainty of the World of Spirits, has the like\nProofs in it. Mr. Aubrey, Fellow of the Roy\nal Society, has written largely concerning Se\ncond-sighted Persons ; so has Dr. Beaumont, in\nhis Book of Gentj and Familiar Spirits , who\nhas collected almost all the other Accounts\ntogether ; and many others , whose very\nNames it would be tedious to recite. How\never, as there are a few more Passages very\ncurious in themselves, I will venture so far\nupon the Reader's Patience, as not only to\nrecite the Names of the Authors, but the Ac\ncounts themselves, in as succinct and brief a\nmanner as it is possible for any one to do.\nMr. Th. May, in his History, Lib. 8. writes,\nThat an old Man (like an Hermtt,) Second-\nsighted, took his Leave of K. James I. when\nhe came into England .* He took little Notice\nof Prince Henry ; but addressing himself to\nthe Duke of Tor k, [since K. Charles I] fell a\nweeping, to think what Misfortunes he should\nundergo ; and that He should be one of the\nmost Miserable and most Unhappy Princes\nthat ever was.\nA Scots Nobleman sent for one of these\nSecond-sighted Men out of the Highlands, to\ngive his Judgment of the then Great George\nViUarsy Duke of Buckingham. As soon as ever\n% he\n\fof Mr. Duncan Cam pbell. 195:\nhe saw him ; Pifi, said he, He will come to\nNothing : Isee a Dagger in his Breast. And\nhe was stabbed in the Breast by Captain Tel-\nton, as has been at large recounted in some\nof the foregoing Pages.\nSir James Melvil hath several the like pas\nsages in his history.\nA certain old Man in South-Wales , told a\ngreat Man there of the Fortune of his Family ;\nand that there should not be a Third Male\nGeneration. It has fallen out accordingly.\nSir William Dugdale, with his own Mouth,\ninform 'd several Gentlemen, that Major-Ge\nneral Middleton (since Lord) went into the\nHighlands of Scotland, to endeavour to make\na Party for King Charles I. An old Gentle\nman (\"that was Second sighted) came and told\nhim, that his Endeavour was good, but he\nwould be unsuccessful : And moreover, That\nthey would put the King to Death j and that\nseveral other Attempts would be made, but all\nin vain. But that his Son would come in, but\nnot reign in a long Time ; but would at lafi\nbe restored. This Lord Middleton had a great\nFriendship with the Laird Bocconi ; and they\nmade an agreement, that the first of them\nthat died, would appear to the other in Ex\ntremity. The Lord Middleton was taken\nPrisoner at Worcester Fight, and was prisoner\nin the Tower of London, under Three Locks*\nLying in his Bed, pensive,. Bocconi appear d to\nhim : My Lord Middleton ask'd him, if he\nO 3. were\n\f196 The Live1 and Advent ujies\nwere dead or alive ? He said, dead ; and that\nhe was a Ghost : And told him , that within\nThree Days he mould escape ; and he did so,\nin his Wife's Cloaths. When he had done his\nMestage, he gave a Frisk, and said,\nGivanni, Givanni, 'tis very firange,\nIn the World to fee so sudden a change :\nAnd then gather'd up, and vanilh'd. This Ac\ncount Sir William Dugdale had from the Bi\nshop of Edinburgh\u00bb ; and this Account he hath\nwrit in a Book of Miscellanies, which is now\ndeposited (with other 'Books 'of his) in the\n\u25a0Museum at'Oxsord.\nThus the Reader fees, what great Autho\nrities may be produced to prove, that wonder\nful and true predictions have been deliver d\nby many Persons gifted with the Second-Sight :\nThe most learned Men in almost all Nations,\nwho are not' in all Likelihood deceiv d them\nselves ;\u25a0 the most celebrated; and authentick\nHistorians, and some Divines, in England,\n\"who, tis not to be thought, have combined\ntogether, and made it their Business to obtrude\nupon us Fallhoods ; Persons' of all Ranks,\nfrom the highest to the lowest, in Scotland,\nwho (it would be even Madness to think )\nwould join in confederacy to impose Tricks\nupon us, and to persuade us to the greatest\nof Impostures, as solemn truths' delivered\nfrom their own Mouths : All these, I fey,\nhave unanimously, and (as it were) with one\nvoice affected, repeated, and consirm'd to us,\n1 .. that\n\f**\u2022\n\u25a0\nof Mr. Duncan Campbell, 197\"\nthat there have~been -at all Times, and in\nmany different Nations, and that still there\nare persons, who, postefs'd with the Gift of a\nSecond-Sights predict Things that wonderfully\ncome to pass, and seem to merit very little\nless than the Name of Prophets, for their mi\nraculous Discoveries. Now if any Man should\ncome, and without giving the least manner\nof Reason for it,\n(\nfor there\nis\nno Reason to be\ngiven against such Asiertions\n;\n)\ndeclare his\ndisbelief of all these authentick, tho strange,\nAccounts\n;\ncan he with Reason imagine, that\nhis Incredulity \/hall pass for\na\nToken of Wis\ndom\n?\nShall his Objlinacy confute the Learned?\nShall his Want of Faith be thought juHly to\ngive the lye to\nso\nmany Persons of the highejl\nHonour and Quality, and ofthe most undoubted\nIntegrity\n.<?\nIn fine, shall his Infidelity, by\na\nre-\nverse kind of Power to that which\nis\nattribu\nted to the Philosophers Stone, be able to change\nthe Nature of Things\n',\n>\nturn and transmute\nTruth into Falfbood, -and* make\na\ndownright\nplain matter ofFaB, to be no more than\na\nChim\u0153ra; or an Ens Rationis\n.<?\nAnd shall\na\nma\nnifest experience be\nso\neasily exploded\n.<?\nTaking\nit\ntherefore for granted, that no\nmiddle man whatsoever,\n(\ntho' never\nso\nhard\nof Belief, which\nis\ncertainly as great\na\nWeak\nness as that of too much Credulity\n;\n)\nwill\nmake bold openly to declare his Disbelief of\nThings\nso\nwell attested\n;\nand taking\nit\nmuch\nmore for granted still, that\nit\nis\nimpossible for\nO\n3\nany\nV*!\n\f198 The Life and Adventures\nany Man of common Sense to have the Front\nof declaring his disbelief of them in such a\nmanner, as to urge it for an argument, and a\nReason, why others should disbelieve them\ntoo : Taking this, I fay, as I think I very\nwell may, for granted ,- I think there remains\nnothing farther for me to offer, before I con\nclude this Chapter, except a few Remarks, as\nto the Similitude there is between those Acti\nons, which I have related above to have been\npenorm d by Mr. Campbell, and these Acti\nons which so many Learned, Ingenious, and\nNoble Authors as I have just now quoted, have\nasserted to have been perrbrm'd by Persons,\nwhom they knew to be gifted with the Se\ncond Sight.\nAs to what is said, (\"several Pages above )\nconcerning Duncan Campbells when a Boy at\nEdinburgh, that he even told his little Com\npanions, who would have Success at their\nlittle M itches, when they play'd ar Marbles ;\nand that he inform'd a great Gamester there,\n( La hose Name I have disguized under that of\nCount Cog) what Times he should chuse to\nplay, if he would win ; as ludicrous as it may-\nhave appear 'd to be , and as much as it may\nhave seemed to my Readers to carry with it\nnothing better than the Face of Invention,\nand the Air of Fiction : Yet if they will be at\nthe Pains of comparing that Paflage of Dun\ncan Campbell's, with the Account given in\n\u2022\nthis Chapter from the Mouth of Sir Norman\nMac-\n\fof Mr. DukcanGampbell 201\nFirst then, if we have a mind to make a\ntolerable guess, which way Mr. Campbell came\nacquainted that the Death of the beautiful\nyoung Lady, Mrs. Willard' was so near at\nHand, and that, tho' she was so universally\nadmired, she would Die unmarried ; the Ac\ncounts given of other Second'fight ed Persons\nin the like Cafes, will put us in the most pro\nbable way of guessing right. This is ex\nplains by the Seventh Observation in this\nChapter, where it is said from Mr. Marten,\nthat when a Shroud is perceiv'd about one,\nit's a sure Prognostick of Death\n';\u2022\nthe Time\nis\njudg'd according to the Height of\nit,\nabout\nthe Person\n;\nfor\nif\nit\nbe not seen above the\nmiddle, Death\nis\nnot to be expected for the\nspace of\na\nYear or longer, but as\nit comes\nnearer to the Head\nit\nis\nexpected sooner\n;\nif\nso, the very Head,\nit\nis\nconcluded to be at\nHand within\na\nfew Days,\nif\nnot Hours. Of\nthis we have an Example of which Mr. Mar\nten was an Eye- witness, concerning the Death\nof his own Acquaintance\n;\nbut he did not in\nthe least regard\nit,\ntill the Death of the Per\nson, about the Time foretold, confirm'd to\nhim the certainty of the prediction.\nSecondly, As to the ignominious Death that\nIrwin came to* and which He predicted to his\nMother,\nso\nlong before, when (he was\nin\nflourishing Circumstances, and when there\nwas no appearance, that any of her Children\nshould be.Jbrought to\na\nbeggarly Condition,\n'\n'\nbl and\n\faox The Life and Adventures\nand learn among base Gangs of Company to\nthieve, and be carried to the Gallows.: The\nStory told in this Chapter of some of in\nJjabitants of Harries, ailing round the Isle of\nShe, and seeing the Apparition of two Men\nhanging by the Ropes on the Mast of their\nVessel, and when they came to the opposite\nmainland, finding two Criminals just sen\ntence! to Death, by Sir Donald Mac Donald,\nand seeing their own very Mast and Ropes\nmade choice of for their Execution, clears up\nthe manner how Mr. Campbell might predict\nthis of Irwin likewise by the force of the\nSecond-Sight.\nThirdly, As to Mr. Campbell's telling Chri\nstallina the Belle, and chief Toast ofthe Court,\nand Urbana the reigning Beauty of the City,\nthat they would shortly be married, and who\nwere to be their husbands ; it is a Thing he\nhas done almost every Day in his Life to one\nWoman or other, that comes to consult him\nabout the Man she is to be married to ; the\nmanner, he probably takes in doing this, may\nbe likewise explain'd by the foregoing Story\nin this Chapter, about the Savants, who said\nthey saw three Men standing by the left\nhand of their Master's Daughter ; and that\nhe that was nearest would marry her first,\nwhom they plainly and exactly described, tho\nthey had never seen him but in their Vision,\nas appeared afterwards. For within some\nfrlonths after, the very Man described, did\ncome\n\fof Mr. Dun can Campbell %o%\ncome to the House, and did marry her. Vide-\nthe Eighth Observation of the Second-Sight.\nFourthly, As to the predictions deliver d\nby Mr. Campbell to the Merchant, which are\nset down at length in the foregoing chapter,\nI know no better way at guessing the manner\nbow the Second-Sight operated in him at that\nTime, than by comparing them to these Two\nInstances, which I briefly repeat, because\nthey are set down at length before in this\nchapter. And first it may be ask'd, how did\nthe Second- Sight'operate in Mr. Campbell, when\nit gave him to know, that the Merchants\nShips, which repeated Intelligences had in\nappearance confirm'd to be lost, were at that\ntime safe, and would return securely home\ninto the Harbour designed >. The best way of\naccounting for\nit,\nthat\nI\nknow,\nis\nby the Story\nthat Sir Norman Maclead\nis\nabove affirm'd\nto have told with his own Mouth concerning\na\nServant of his, who rightly foretold his re\nturning Home, and landing on the Isle of\nBernera one Night, where his Residence\nis,\nWhen there was very little or no likelihood of\nit,\nbecause of the Darkness of the Night, and\nthe Danger of coming through the Rocks that\nlie round the line. When Sir Norman exa-\nmin'd him about\nit\n;\nhe answered that he knew\nit\nby\na\nVision of the Spirit Browne\n;\nand hence\nit\nmay be the most probably conjectured, that\nMr. Campbell\ns\nknowledge of the Merchant's\nShips being safe, came from\na\nVision of his\nparticular\n\fio4 The Life and Adventures\nparticular Genius or familiar Spirit, which we\nspoke of before. What I have already in\nstanced in, is (I think) sufficient with regard\nto the wonderful Things which Mr. Camp\nbell has perform'd, either by the Intervention,\nof a Genius, or the Power of a Second-Sight.\nBut as he has frequently done a great many\namazing Performances, which seem to be of\nsuch a Nature, that they can't be well and\nclearly explain'd to have been done either by\nthe Intervention of his familiar Spirit and\nGenius, or by the Power of the Second-Jighted\nFaculty, we must have recourse to the Third\nMeans, by which only such Predictions and\nPractices can becompass'd, before we expound-\nthese new Mysteries, which appear like incre\ndible Riddles, and \u00c6nigmds at the first ; and\nthis Third Means which we must have re\ncourse to for expounding these strange Acts\nof his, is a due Consideration of the Force\nand Power of Natural Magick, which toge\nther with a Narrative of the A&s, which he\nseems magically to bring about, will be the\nSubject of the following Chapter.\nCHAP.\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 205\n, . jk '\nChap. VIII.\nA Dissertation upon Magick \u25a0under all . zfcr\nBranches, with some remarkable Particu-\n-'-\nlars, relating to Mr. Campbell * private Life;\nBU\nT before we proceed to our Disqui\nsitions concerning the power and Edie\ncacy of natural Magick, and examine whatmy-^\nsterious Operations may be brought about and\ncompase'd by magical practices.- And before\nwe take a farther Survey of what Mr. Camp.-?\nJell has performed in this Kind, that relates\nto his Profession and. the p'ublick Part of his\nLife, which concerns other People as well as\nhimself ; I shall here' relate. some, singular Ad\nventures that he pass'd thorough in his. private-\nLife, and which regard only, his own Person.\nIn order to this j must return back to the\nYear 1 70.x * about . which time some unac\ncountable Turns of Fortune attended him in\nhis own incapacity,! which must be\nvery surprizing and entertaining to my Rea\nders, when they find: a Man whose Foresight\nwas always so great a- Help and Assistance, to.\nothers, who consulted him ,in their own fe\nture Affairs,! helpless (as C has ;been,a'n-OJb>\nderivation concerning all such men in the Ac\ncount of theSd.cond-Sjght) and :blind in his\nown future Affairs, tots d up.- and down by\ninevitable and spigh\\tf*ul Accidents of Fortune*\nand made the May-game -of! Chance and Hts,\n\u2022\na zafd,\n\fio6 The Life and Adventures\nzard, as if that way-ward and inconstant\nGoddess was refolv'd to punish him, when\nshe catch'd him on the blind Side, for having\nfaith a quick insight and penetrating faculty\nin other Peoples Matters, and scrutinizing\ntoo narrowly into her Mysteries, and be fore\ntimes preventing those fatal Intentions of hers,\ninto which she would fain lead many Mor\ntals hood- wink'd, and before they knew where\nthey were. In this Light, these mighty and\nfamous seers seem to be born for the Benefit\nand Felicity of others, but at the fame time\nto be born to Unhappinefs themselves. And cer\ntainly, in as much as we consider them as useful\nand beneficial often, but always satisfactory to\nPersons who are curious in their Enquiries\nabout their Fortunes ; it will be natural to\nthose of us, who have the least Share of Ge\nnerosity in our Minds, to yield our Pity and\nCompassion to them, when they are remar\nkably unfortunate themselves ; especially when\nthat Calamity seems more particularly to light\nupon them for their Ability, and endeavour\nto consult the good Fortune of other Folks.\nAbout the above-mentionedYear i yoxJ)un~\ncan Campbell grew a little tired of his Profession.\nSuch a multitude of Followers troubled him,\nseveral of whom were wild Youths and came\nto banter him, and many more too inquisitive\nFemales, to teaze him with endless Imper\ntinences, and who, the more he told them,\nhad still the more to ask , and whose Curio*\niky was never to be satisfied : And besides this,\nho\n\fof Mr. Duncan Ca mfbellI 107\nhe was so much envy'd, and had\nGer\nmany-\nmalicious Artifices daily practised against him,\nthat he refolv'd to leave off his Profession*\nHe had\n(I\nknow) followed\nit\npretty closely\nfrom the time\nI\nfirst saw him\nin\nLondon,which\nwas\nI\nthink in the beginning ofthe year\n1\n698,\ntill the Year 1702, with very good success\n;\nand in those few Years he had got together:\na\npretty round Sum of Money. Our young\nSeer was now at Man's Estate,and had learn'd\nthe Notion that he was to be his own Gover\nnor, so far as to be his own Counsellor too\nsome what Road of Life he was to take\n5\nartd\nthis Consideration (no doubt) work'd with\na\ndeeper Impression on his Mind, than\nit\nusu\nally does on others that are in the fame blos\nsoming Pride of Manhood, because\nit might\nappear more natural for him to believe, that\nhe had\na\nsufficient Ability to be his own pro*\nper Adviser, who had given\nso\nmany others,\nand some more aged than himself, Counsel,\nwith very good Success. Now every expe-\nrienc'd Person knows, that when Manhood\nis\nyet green,it\nis\nstill\nin\nthe frame dangerous con\ndition as\na\nyoung plant, which\nis\nliable to be\nwarp'd by\na\nThousand cross fortuitous Acci\ndents,\nif\ngood Measures be not taken to sup\nport\nit\nagainst all the contingent Shocks\nit\nmay meet with from the Weather or other\nwise. Now\nit\nwas his Misfortune to be made\naverse to Business, which he lov'd before, by\nhaving too much of\nit,\nand to be\nso\nso.vred\nby meeting with numerous Perplexities and\nmare\n\f2,08 The Life and Adventures\nmalicious Rubs laid in his way by invidious\nPeople,f who are the useless and injurious Bujy-i\nbodies, that always repine at the good of\nothers, and rejoice to do harm to the diligent\nand Assiduous, though they reap no profit by\nit themselves? ) that he was disgusted artd de-\nterr'd entirely from the Prosecution of a Pro\nfession, by which he got not only a compe\ntent but a copious and plentiful Subsistences\nNay, indeed this was another Mischief arising\nto him from his having so much business,\nthat he had got Money enough to leave it off,\"\nwhen the Perplexities of 'it^'had made him\nwilling to do st and to live very comfortably\nand handsomely, like . a'Gentleman without\nit for a time.' ;' and we know the youngest\nmen are not wont to look the farthest before\nthem in matters that concern their own Wel-\nfare. Now inasmuch as he had thus taken\na Disgust to Business and Application,and was\nsurfeited (as I may say^ with the Perplexities\nof\nit,\nit\nmust be as natural for him, we know*\nto search for Repose in the contrary Extream^\nviz,. Recreation and Idleness, as\nit\nis\nfor a\nMan to seek Rest after toil, to sleep after\na\nDay's Labour, or to sit down after\na\nlong and\ntiresome Walk. But there are two very\ndi\nstinct Sorts of Idleness, and two very different\nKinds of Recreation\n;\nthere\nis\na\nshameful Idle-1\nness which\nis\nno better than downright-\nSloth\n;\nand there\nis\na\nsplendid kind of Indo\nlence, where\na\nMan having taken an Aversion\n:\nCO\n\fof Mr. DuncakCimpbe ll. xoj*\nto the Wearisometiets of a business which pro\nperly belongs to him, neglects not however\nto employ his Thoughts, when they are va\ncant from what they ought more chiefly to\nbe about, in other Matters not entirely un\nprofitable in Life, the Exercise of which he\nfinds he can follow with more abundant Ease\nand Satisfaction. There are some Sorts of\nRecreations too, that are mean, fordid, and\nbase ,\u2022 others, that are very innocent, tho'\nvery diverting, and that will give me the\nvery next most valuable Qualifications' of a\nGentleman, after those which are obtained\nby a more serious Application of the Mind.\nThe Idea which I have already given my\nReaders of our Duncan Campbell, will easily\nmake them judge, before I tell them, which\nway (in these two ways) his Genius would\nnaturally lead him ; and that, when he grew\nan idle Man, he would rather indulge him\nself with applying his Mind to the mining\nTrifles of Life, than be wholly slothful and\nunactive ; and that when he diverted him\nself, he would not do it after a sordid, base\nmanner, as having a better Taste, and a Relish\nfor good Company ; but that his Recreations\nwould still be the Recreations of a Gentle\nman. And just, accordingly, as my Readers\nwould naturally judge beforehand in his cafe,\nso it really happen 'd : The Moment he look\noff Business, and dismiss d the Thoughts of\nit, his Genius led him to a very gallant\nP\n'\nWay\nX -v.\n\f\u2022\nxto The Life and Adventures\nWay of Life ; in his Lodgings, in his Enter\ntainments, in paying and receiving visits, in\nCoffee- Houses, in Taverns, in Fencing-Schools,\nin Balls and other Publick Assemblies ; in all\nways, in fine, both at home and abroad, Dun\ncan Campbell was a well- comported and Civil\nFine Gentleman : He was a Man of Pleasure j\nand nothing of the Man of Business appear'd\nabout him. But a Gentleman's Life, without\na Gentleman's Estate, (however shining and\npleasant it may be for a Time) will certainly\nend in Sorrow, if not in Infamy. And com\nparing Life (as Moralists do) to a Day,\none may safely pronounce this Truth to\nall the splendid Idlers I have mention d ;\nThat if they have sunshiny Weather till Noon,\nyet the Afternoon of their Life will be very\nstormy, rainy and uncomfortable, and per\nhaps just at the End of theirjourney, (to carry\non the Metaphor throughout) close in the l\nest kind of Night. Of this, as I was a Man of\nYears, and more experienc'd in the World\nthan he, I took upon me to forewarn Mr.\nCampbell, as soon as I perceiv'd the first dange\nrous Fit of this elegant Idleness had seiz'd\nhim. But when will young Men, by so much\nthe more headstrong, as they have less of the\nBeard, be guided, and brought to learn 2 And\nwhen shall we see that happy Age, in which\nthe grey Heads of old Men shall be clapp'd\nupon the Shoulders of Youth ? I told him,\nthat in this one Thing he ought to consult me,\nand\n\fof \u00c6f>\\DnNCAN Campbell. 211\nand acknowledge me to be a true Prophet,\nif I told him the End of the seeming merry\nSteps in Life he was now taking, would in\nfallibly bring him to a Labyrinth of Difficul\nties ; out of which if he extricated himself at\nall, he would at least find it a laborious Piece\nof Work. His Taste had been already vitia\nted, with the Sweets which lay at the Top of\nthe bitter Draught of Fortune ; and my honest\nrugged Counsel came too late to prevail, when\nhis Fancy had decoy'd and debauch'd his\nJudgment, and. carry 'd it over into another\nInterest. I remember I writ down to him\nthe Moral Story, where vicious Pleasure and\nVirtue are pictured by the Philosopher to ap\npear before Hercules , to court him into two\nseveral Paths. I told him more particularly,\nsince he had not an Estate to go thro' with\nthe Gentlemanly Life, (\"as he called it ) that\nif he followed the alluring Pleasures, which\nendeavour'd to tempt Hercules, he would in\nvolve himself at last in a whole Heap of Mise\nries, out of which it would be more than an\nHerculean Labour for him to disentangle\nhimself again. If he had been a Man that\ncould have ever heard with either, I would\nhave told the Reader in a very familiar Idi\nom, that he turn'd the deaf Ear to me ; for\nhe did not mind one Syllable nor Tittle of the\nPrescriptions I set down for him, no more\nthan if he had never read them ; but, varying\nthe Phrase a little, I may fay at least, when\n. . P 2 he\n\fxii The Life and Adventures\nhe should have look'd upon my Counsel with\nall the Eyes he had, he turn'd the blind Side\nupon\nit.\nI\nwas resolv'd to make use of the Re\nvenge natural to\na\nMan of Years, and there\nfore apply\nd\nthat reproachful Proverb to him,\nwhich we Ancients delight much\nin\nmaking\nuse of to Youths, that follow their own false\nand hot Imaginations\n,\nand will not heed\nthe cooler dictates of Age, Experience, and\nWisdom. Accordingly\nI\nwrote down to him\nthese Words, and left him in\na\nseeming Pas\nsion.\n'\nI\nam very well afford, young Alan,\n4\nyou think me, that am old, to be\na\nFool\n;\nbut\n'\n\/,\nthat am old, absolutely know you (who are\n*\na\nyoung fellow) to bea downright Fool\n;\nand\n'\nso\nI\nleave you to follow your own ways, till\n4\nfad and woful Experience teaches you to\n1\nknow\nit\nyour own self, and makes you come\n'\nto me, to own\nit\nof your own accord.' As\nI\nwas going away, after this tart Admonition and\nsevere Reprimand,\nI\nhad\na\nMind to observe\nhis Countenance, and\nI\nsaw him smile\n,\u2022\nwhich\nI\nrightly construed to be done\nin\nContempt of\nthe Advice of Age, and in the Gaiety and Ful\nness of conceit\n,\nwhich Youth entertains of\nits owtt'fond Opinions, and hair-brain'd ram\nRefolves. He was got into the Company of\na\nvery pretty set of 'Gentlemen, whose For\ntunes were far superior to his\n;\nbut he follow'd\nthe fame genteel Exercises, as Fencing, <&c.\narid made one at all their Publick Entertain\nments\n:\nAnd -so; being at an equal Expence\nwith\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell, xij\nwith those who could well afford to spend\nwhat they did out of their Estates, he went\non very please ntly for a Time ; still if\nand never getting ; without ever <\nthat it must, by inevitable Corrfeq;\nto his Lot at last, to be entirely reduced to a\nState of Indigence and Want. And what com\nmonly heightens the Misfortunes of fochMen,\n(and so of all Gentlemen's younger Brothers,\nwho live upon the ready Money that is given\nthem for their Portions n\nis,\nthat the Profile\nrity they live\nin\nfor\na\nTime, gains them Credit\nenough just to bring them in Debt, and ren\nder them more miserable than those very\nWretches, who never had either any Money\nor Credit at all. They run themselves into\nDebt out of Shame\n,\nand to put off the evil\nDay of appearing ruin'd Men as long cs they\ncan\n;\nand then when their Tempers are four\nd\nby Adversity, they grow tird of their own\nLives\n;\nand then in\na\nquarrel, they, or some\nother Gentleman, may be,\nis\nrun through\n;\nor else, being hunted by bailiffs, they exer\ncise their Swords upon those Pursuers. Thus,\nwhere Gentlemen will not consider their Cir\ncumstances, their very Prosperity\nis\na\nCause\nof, and aggravates their- Misery\n;\ntheir very\nPride (which was a decent Pride \u00ab first) m\nkeeping up and maintaining their credit* Ob\njects them too otten to the yyjmA, and the\nmeanest Ads\n-T\nand their courage, which -am\nof\na\nlaudable Kind, turns into\na\nbrurift tM\nP\n\\\nft\n\fzi4 The Life and Adv e ntures\nsavage Rage ; and all the fine, esteem'd-flou-\nrishing and happy Gentleman, ends, and is\nlost, in the contemn'd, poor and miserable\nDesperado ; whose Portion at last is Confine\nment and a Gaol, and sometimes even worse,\nand what I shall not so much as name here.\nInto many of these Calamities Mr. Campbell\nhad brought himself before it was long, by\nhis Heedlesness, and running (according to the\nwild dictates of Youth) counter to all found\nand wholsome Advice. He had, it seems,\nrun himself into Debt ; and one Day, as he\nwas at a Coffee-House, the Sign of the Three\nCrowns in Great Queenftreet , in rufh'd Four\nBailiffs upon him, who being directed by the\nCreditors Wife, had watch'd him into that\nHouse, and told him they had a Warrant a-\ngainst him ; and upon his not answering, they\nbeing unacquainted with his being deaf and\ndumb, ofTcr'd to seize his sword. He start\nled at their offering of Violence ; and taking\nthem for Rieffians, (which he had often met\nwith) repcll d the Aslaulters ; and drawing his\nSword, as one Man (more bold than the rest)\nclosed in with him, he fliorten'd his blade,\nand, in the Fall , pinn'd the Fellow thro' the\nShoulder, and himself thro' the Leg, to the\nFloor. After that he stood at Bay with all\nthe Four Officers, when the most mischievous\nAflailant of them all (the Creditors Wife)\nventur'd to step into the Fray, and very bar\nbarously took hold of that nameless Part; of\nthe\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell, xij\nthe Man, f for which, as she was a married\nWoman, Nature, methinks, should have taught\nher to have a greater Tenderness ,0 and almost\n(queez'd and crufh'd those Vitals to Death.\nBut at last he got free from them all, and was\ngoing away as fast as he could, not knowing\nwhat Consequences might ensue : But the\nWoman, who aim'd her self at Committing\nMurder, in the most savage and inhuman\nmanner, ran out after him, crying out Mur\nder, Murder, as loud as (he could, and alarm\ned the whole Street. The Bailiff following\nthe Woman, and being bloody from Head to\nFoot, by means of the Wound he receiv'd,\ngave Credit to the Outcry. The late Earl Ri\nvers s Footmen happening to be at the Door,\nran immediately to stop the luppos'd Mur\nderer ; and they indeed did take him at last,\nbut perceiv'd their mistake, and discover d,\nthat instead of being Assistants in taking a\nMan, whom they thought to be a Murderer,\nendeavouring to make his Escape from the\nHands of Justice, they had only been trick'd\nin by that false Cry, to be Adjutants to a Bar.\nlifFin retaking a Gentleman, who by so gallant\na Defence, had rescued himself from the Dan\ngers of a Prison ; and when they had disco\nver d this their mistake, they were mighty\nsorry for what they had done. The most active\nand busy among the Earl's Footmen, was a\nDutchman ; and the Earl happening to be\nin a Room next the Street, and hearing the\nP 4 Out\n\fti6 The Life and Adven\u00a5ujI es\nOutcry of Murder, steppdtotheWinddw.; and\nseeing his own Servants in the Midst of the\nBustle, examin'd the Dutchman how the\nMatter was : And being told it ; he chid the\nMan, for being concern'd in stopping a Gen\ntleman, that was getting free from such trou\nblesome companions. But the Dutchman ex\ncused himself like a Dutchman^ by making a\nmerry Blunder for a Reply.\n*\nSacrament ey\n1\nsaid he to his Lord ; if I had thought they\n' were Bailiffs , I would have fought for the\n*\npoor dumb Gentleman.; but then why had\n(\nnot he told me they were bailiffs, my Lord ?\nIn short, Duncan Campbell w as carry d off\nas their Prisoner j but the bailiff that was\nwounded, was led back to the Coffee-Houfe,\nwhere he pretended the Wound was mortal ;\nand that he despair d of living an Hour. The\nProverb, however, was on the Fellows Side ;\nand he recover d sooner than other People ex\npected he could. As soon as all Danger was\nover, an Action for Damages' and Smart-Mo-\nney as their Term is) was brought against\nMr. Campbell ; the Damages were exaggera\nted, and the Demand was so extra vagant,that\nDuncan Campbel was\nneither able, just at that\ntime, nor willing, had he been able, to pay\nfo much, as he thought, in his own Wrong,\nand having no BailT and being afham'd to\nmake his case known to his better fort of\nFriends, who were, both able and willing to\nhelp him at a dead lift, he was hurry'd away\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 117\nto Gaol by the BaylifFs, who sliew'd such a\nmalignant and insolent Pleasure, as commonly\nattends powerful Revenge, when they put\nhim into the Marflialsea. There he lay in\nConfinement six Weeks, till at last Four or\nfive of his chief Friends came by mere\nchance to hear of it ; immediately they con\nsulted about his Deliverance,and unanimously\nresolved to contribute for his enlargement,\nand they accordingly went cross the Water\ntogether, and procured it out of Hand.\n1 Two of his benefactors were Officers, and\nwere just then going over to Flanders. Dun\ncan Campbell, to whom they communicated\ntheir Design, was resolved to try his Fortune\nin a Military Way, out of a, roving kind of\nHumour raised in him, partly by his having\ntaken a fort of Aversion to his own Profession\nin Town, and partly, by his finding that he\ncould not live, without following a Profession\nas he had done, any longer. He over a bot\ntie frankly imparted his Mind to them at\nlarge ; he signify d to them that he hoped,\nsince they had lately done him so great a Fa\nvour, in freeing him from one Captivity, they\nwould not think him too urgent, if he press'd\nfor one Favour farther, upon Natures so ge\nnerous as theirs, by whom he took as great\ndis\npleasure in being obliged, as he could re\nceive\nin\nbeing capable of obliging others. He\nwrote to them that the Favour he meant was\n%o redeem him from another captivity, al-\n.\n-\nmost\n\fai8 The Life and Adventures\nmost as irksome to him, as that, out of which\nthey had lately ransom'd him. This Captivity,\ncontinued he,\nis,\nbeing either sored to follow\nmy old Profession, which\nI\nhave taken an en\ntire Disgust to, for\na\nMaintenance, or being\nsored to live\nin\na\nnarrower Way than suits\nwith my Genius, and the better Taste\nI\nhave\nof higher Life. Such\na\nState, Gentlemen, you\nknow is more unpalatable than Half-Pay\n;\nit\nis. like either being sored to go upon the for\nlorn Hope, or else like\na\nMan's being an entire\nly\ncasliier'd and broken Officer, that had no\nyounger Brother's Fortune, and no other Sup\nport but his Commission. Thus though you\nhave set my Body at Liberty, my Soul\nis\nstill\nunder an Imprisonment, and will be till\nI\nleave England, and can find means of visiting\nFlanders, which\nI\ncan do no otherwise than\nhy the Advantage of having you for my Con\nvoy..\nI\nhave\na\nmighty longing to Experience\nsome part of\na\nMilitary Life, and\nI\nfancy,\nif\nyou will grant me your Interest, and intro\nduce me to the valiant young Lord Lome.,\nand be Spokes-men for\na\ndumb Man,\nI\nshall\nmeet with\na\nfavourable Reception\n;\nand as\nfor you (Gentlemen) after having named that\ngreat Patron and Pattern of Courage and\nConduct in the .Field,\nI\ncant doubt but the\nvery Name\nI\nbear^\nif\nyou had not known me,\nwould have made you taken me for\na\nPerson\nof\na\nMilitary Genius, and that\nI\nshould do\nnothing but what would become\na\nBritish\nSol\n\f(^\"JMr. DuncakCaii pbfll 219\nSoldier and a Gentleman ; nothing in fine\nthat should make you repent the Recom\nmendation.\nThese generous and gallant Friends of his,\nit seems, comply'd with his Request, and pro-\nmis'd they would make Application for him\nto the Lord Ixrne ; and Duncan Campbell had\nnothing to do but to get his Bag and Baggage\nready and provide himself with a Pass. His\nBaggage was not very long getting together,\nand he had it in tolerable good Order ; and\nas for his Pass, a Brother of the Lord\nForbes was so kind, as to procure him one\nupon the first Application Duncan made to\nhim.\nAccordingly in a few Days afterwards they\nwent on Board, and having a speedy and an\neasy Paslage, arrived soon ax Rotterdam. Dun\ncan met with some of his English Acquain\ntance in that Town, and his Miud being pret\nty much bent upon rambling, and seeing all\nthe Curiosities, Customs, and Humours, he\ncould, in all the Foreign Places he was to pafe\nthorough ; he- went out of a Frolick with\nsome Gentlemen, next Day, in a Boat to an\nadjacent Village, to make merry over a home\nly Dutch Entertainment, the intended Repast\nbeing to consist of what the Boors there count\na great Delicacy, brown Bread and white\nBeer. He walk d out of fight from his Com\npany, and they lost one another ; and strolling\nabout by himself at an unseasonable Hour, as\nthey\nS\"\n\fno The Life and ADVErftuRES\nthey call it there after the Bell has toll'd,\nDuncan Campbell, who neither knew their\nLaws, nor if he had, was capable of being\nguided by the notice which their Laws ordain,\nwas taken into Custody in the Village for that\nNight, and carry'd away! the next Day to\ntPilliatnflsd't; where he was taken for a Spy,\nand put into a close Imprisonment for Three\nor Four Days. > \u25a0. . A S . \u2022\nBut some Scots Gentlemen, who had been\nin Company with Mr. Campbell at Mr. Cloy-\nfierman's a Painter in Covent-Garden, made\ntheir Application to the Magistrate, and got\nhim released : He knew his Friends the Of\nficers that carried him over were gone for\nward to the Camp, and that there was no\nHope of finding them at Rotterdam, if he\nftould go thither, and so he refolv'd since he\nhad had so many Days Paniihment in Wtl-\nliam\/ladt, to have Three or Four Days Plea\nsure there too by way of Amends, before he\nwould ret otit on his journey after his Friends.\nBut on the Third N ght he got very much in\nDrink ; and as he went Very boisterously and\ndisorderly along, a Centinel challeng'd him ;\u2022\nand the want of the Sense of Hearing had like\nto have occasion'd the Loss of his Life. The\nCentind fir d at him and narrowly mifs'd him';\nHe Was taken Prisoner, not without some Re\nsistance, which was so far Innocent, as that\nhe knew not any Reason why he mould be\nseized ;but very troublesome-and unwarranta\nble\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell, xxi\nble in so orderly a Town ; so the Governor s\nSecretary, after the Matter was examined in\nto, judging it better for the unhappy Gentle\nman's future Safety, advis'd him to return\nhome to his own Country, and accordingly\nbespoke him a Place in a Dutch ship called\nTowsrow Catherine, for his PafTageto England.\nDuncan Campbell had taken up his Hu\nmour of rambling first, of his own accord,\nand the Troubles which he had run himself\ninto by\nit,\nwe may reasonably suppose, had\npretty well cured him of that extravagant\nItch\n;\nand there\nis\nlittle - doubt to be made,'\nbut that he rejoyc'd very heartily, when he\nwas got on Board the Ship to return to Eng\nland\n;\nand that, in his new Resolutions, he\nhad reconciled himself to the prosecution of\nhis former Profession, and intended to set up\nfor\na\nPrediBor again as soon as he could arrive\nat London. But now Fortune had not\na\nMind\nto let him go off\nso\n,\u2022\nhe had had his own\nFancy for rambling, and now she was refolv'd\nto have hers, and to give him his bellyful of\nCaprice. Accordingly when the Dutch Ship\ncalled Towsrow Catherine, was-making the best\nof her Road for London, and each Person in\nthe Vessel was making merry, fill'd with the\nhopes of\na\nquick and prosperous Paflage\nj\na\nFrench Privateer appeared\nin\nsight, crouding\nall the Sails (lie could, and bearing towards\nthem with all Haste and Diligence. The Pri\nvateer was doubie-mannd, and carry\n'd\nThirj\nty\n\faix The Life and Adventures\nty Guns : The Dutch vessel was defenfless\nin comparison ; and the People on Board had\nscarce time to think, and to deplore that they\nshould be made a Prey of before they actu\nally were so, and had Reason enough given\nthem for their Sorrow. All the Paslengers, to\na single Man, were stripped, and had French\nSeamens Jackets in exchange for their\nCloaths. Duncan Campbell had now a Taste\ngiven him of the Fate of War, as well as of\nthe Humour of travelling, and wiflVd himself\nagain, I warrant him, among his greatest\nCroud of Confulters, as tiresome as he thought\nBusiness to be, instead of being in the Middle\nof a Crew of Sea-Savages. The Town, where\nthe Dumb Prisoner was at last consind, was\nDenain. There happened to be some Englijh\nFryars there, who were told by the others\nwho he was, and to them he apply d himself\nin Writing, and receiv'd from them a great\ndeal of civil Treatment. But a certain Man\nof the Order of Recolle&s, happening to see\nhim there who had known him in England,\nand what profession he followed, caused him\nto be called in question as a Man that made\nuse of ill means to tell Fortunes. When he\nwas questioned by a whole Society of these\nreligious Men, he made them such pertinent\nand satisfactory Answers in Writing, that he\nconvinced them he had done nothing for\nwhich he deservd their Reprimand ; and they\nunanimously acquitted him. The Heads of\nhis\n\fof Mr. Dusrc ax Ca mfseliZ as*\nhis Defence, as I have been informed, were\nthere..\nFieA He alkdg'd that the Sectmd-Sigbt was\nin-born and in-bred in some men ; and that\nevery Country had had Examples of it more\nor less ; bat that the Country of Scotland, m\nwhich he was educated from an infant, a-\nbounded the most of any with those sort of\nPeople : And from thence he said he thought\nhe might very naturally draw this Conclu\nsion, that a Faculty that was inborn and in\nbred to Men, and grown almost a National\nFaculty among a People who were remark\nably Honest, Upright, and well-meaning Peo\nple, could not, without some Impiety, be im\nputed to the Postestbrs of it as a Sin. And\nwhen one of the Fathers rejoin d, that it was\nremark'd by several Writers of the Second\nSight, that it must be therefore Sinful, be\ncause it remaind no longer among the People\nwhen the doctrines of Christianity were stil\nly propagated, and the Light of the Gospel\nincreased among them ; and that afterwards\nit affected none but Persons of vicious Lives\nand an ill Character : To this objection Mr.\nCampbell reply d, that he knew most (even\ningenious) Writers had made that Remark\nconcerning the Second-Sight, but begged leave\nto be excused, if he ventured to declare, that\nit was no better than a vulgar and common\nError ; and the Reasons were these which he\nalledg d in his own Behalf, and to confirm his\nAssertion,\n\f%t^ The Life and Adventures\nAssertion, he told them Men of undoubted\nProbity, Virtue and Learning, both of their\nown Religion, (via. the Roman Catholick)\nand also of the Reformed Religion, and in seve\nral Nations had been affected, and continued\nall their Lives to be affected, with this second-\nfighting Power, and that there could be there\nfore no room to fix upon it the odious Cha\nracter of being a sinful and vicious (not to fay\nthat some cali'd it still worse, a diabolical J\nTalent. He (aid he would content himself\nwith making but- two instances, because he\nbeliev'd those Two would be enough to give\nContent to them, his Judges too, in that\nCase. In his first instance he told them that\nthey might find somewhat relating to this in\nWcolaus Hemingius, who in his Tract de Su-\nperstitionibus Magicis, printed at Copenhagen,\nAnno 1575, informs the World ;\n\" That Petrus\n\" Paladins, Bishop of Seelandt, and Profeslbr\nu of Divinity at Copenhagen, could, from a\nB\npart of his Body affected, foretel from what\n\" part of the Heavens Tempests would come,\n\" and was seldom deceiv'd\". One of the\nFathers immediately ask'd him , if he un\nderstood Latin\n.<?\n\u2014To this Duncan Campbell re-\nply'd no. Oh\n!\nSaid the Fryar then,\nI\ndon't re\nmember that Book was ever translated into\nEnglish that you mention: \u2014 But rejoin\nd\nDun\ncan Campbell, The Passage\nI\nmention'd to you,\nI\nhave read in an English Book, and Word for\nWord, according to the best of my Memory,\n4\nas\nt\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell %i<>\nas I have written it down to you. \u2014In what\nEnglish Book, said the Friar ? \u2014I don't re\nmember the Name of the Book, Duncan Camp\nbell'ariswerd, but very- well remember the\nPaflages \u25a0; and that it was in a Book of Au\nthority, and which bore a Credit and goodRe-\nch in the World j and you being scholars,\nmay} if you please, have recourse to the learn\ned Original ; and I doubt not, but you'll find\nwhat I fay to be a Trutb.---For the second\ninstance, he told them, That in Spain there\nare those they caMSaludadores^ that-haVe this\nkind' of Gift. There1 was (continued Heisi\nwriting) one of your own religion, Vene\nrable Fathers, and of a Religious Order, nayj\na Fryar too, that had this Gift : He was a\nnoted Dominican, said he ; and tho' I forget\nhis name, you may,- by writing a Letter to!\nEngland, learnJhis name. V He was a deVout!\ned, belonging to Queen Catharine\nDowager's Chapel ; and had the Second-Sigbp\nto a great-degree, and was famous and eminent\nfor kt They then ask'd him, what was the\nfull power he had to do by the Second-Sight ?\nHe answer\n'3,'\nthat as they had intimated that\nthey had perased some of the skilful Wri\nters-concerning the Second-Sight, he did not\ndoubt but they had found (as well as he could\ntell them'\nJ\nthat as to the Extent of Peopled\nKnowledge\nin\nthat secret way,\nit\nreach'd both\npresent, past, and future Events. They fore\nsee Murders, Drownings, Weddings, Burials,\n,\n-:i-'\nQ.\n*\nCom-\n\fai\u00a3 The Life and Adventures\nCombats, Manslaughters, &c. of all which,\nthere are many instances to be given. They\ncommonly foresee fad Events, a little while\nbefore they happen. For Instance ; If a Man's\nfatal End be Hanging, they'll fee a Gibbet, or\nRope about his Neck ; if Beheading, they'll\nsee a Man without a Head ; if drowning,\nthey'll see Water up to his Throat ; if Stab\nbing, they'll see a Dagger in his Breast ; if un\nexpected Death in his Bed, they'll seeaWind-\ning-Sheet about his Head. They foretel not\nonly Marriages, but <*f good Children j what\nkind of Life Men hall lead, and in what Con\ndition they shall die ; also Riches, Honours,\nPreferments, Peaces. Plenty, and good Fa\nther. It is likewise usual with persons that have\nlost .any Thing, to go to some of these Men,\nby whom they are directed how, with what\nPerson's, and some what place they shall find\ntheir Goods. It is alfa to be noted, that these\nGifts bear a latitude, so that some have it in\na far more: eminent Degree than others. And\nwhat I have here written down to you, you\nneed not take as a truth from me, but as it\nconcerned me so nearly': I remember the Pas\nsage by heart, and you will find it very near\nWord for Word, in Dr, Beaumont Book of\nFamiliar Spirits, Aye, said the. Rryafs j but you\nhave a genius too, that attends you, as we are\ninformed. Sq (ireply-diDan^a Campbdfl) have\nall Periods, that liase the S&e\u00bbd-$igbtjf\\ ant\neminent degree ,\\ And to prove this,.! will.\n-fire Cy j:; bring\n\fof Mr. Dux L AN Campbell 2.17\nbring no left a Witness than K. James I who,\nin his demonology (2fc\u00a9\u00a3IH. and Chap, a.)\nmentions also a Spirit caH'd Browne , that\nwas wont formerly to haunt divers Hordes,\nwithout doing any Evil, but doing (as it\nwere) neceffery Turns up and down the\nHouse. He appear d like a rough Man : Nay,\nsome belicv'd, that their House was all the\nSonfier, as they call d it j that is, the more\nlucky or fortunate, that Inch Spirits resorted\nthere. With these Replies the Fryars began\nto own they were very well (kisfy'd, and ac\nquiesced in the Account fae had given of him*\nself, as Ivery good, true, and honest Account.\nBut they told him, they had still a further Ac\ncusation against rum ; and that was, that he\npraclis'd Megick Arts ; and that he used, as\nthey had been inform'd, unlawful Incanta\ntions. To this- he made Answer, That there\nwere two kinds of Magiclt ; of which, he\nkneWj.they that were Men of Learning could\nnot be ignorant. The Art Magick, which is\nwicked and impious, continued he, is that\nwhich is prosds'd, and has been professed at\nall Times in the World, by Witches, Magic\ndans, Diviners, Inchanters, and such like no\ntorious Profligates ; who, by having an unna\ntural Commerce with the Devil, do many\nstrange, prodigious, and preternatural Acts,\nabove and beyond all human wisdom : And\nall the Arguments I ever did, or ever will de\nduce (continued he) from that black Art, is a\nQ, 2. good\n\f128 , The Life Aid. A d v e tffr u r e s\ngood and a shining Argument.- It is this, O\nFathers : I draw a Reason from these prodi\ngious practices of. Wizards, Magicians, In-\ncanters, &c. and from all the Heathen Ido\nlatry and Superstition, to prove, that there\nis a Betty : For, from.these Acts of theirs, be\ning preternatural and above human wisdom,\nwe may consequently infer, that they proceed\nfrom a supernaturabiand immaterial Cause,\nluch as Damons are. Arid this is all the Know\nledge I ever did, or ever will draw from that\nblack, hellish Arti But (Fathers,) there is\nanother Kind of Art Magick, call'd Natural\nMagick, which is directly opposite to theirs ;\nand the object of which Art is to do spiritual\ngood to Mankind) as the object of theirs is\nto torment them, and induce them to evil.\nThey afflict people with Torments ; and my\nArt relieves them \u25a0\"\nfrom the torments they\ncause! . The^pubiick Profession of these Ma\ngical Arts has (as you know, Fathers, tis a\ncommon Distinction between Black and White\nMagick,\") been tolerated in some of the most\nfamous Universities of Christendom ; tho' af\nterwards, for a very good Reason in Poli\nticks, making it a publick. Study to such a\ndegree, was very wisely retrenched by a Pro\nhibition. If this therefore be a Fault in your\nown' Opinions, hear my Accusers ; but if not^\nyou will not only excuse, but commend 'me.\nThe Fry ars. were, extreamly well pleased\nwith his Defence : But one of them had a\ni -' c J Mind\n\fof Mr. DuncanCampbbu. xz?\nMind to frighten him a 'little if he could, and\nask'd him, what he would say, if he could pro\nduce some Witches lately feiz'd, that would\nswear he had been frequently at their unlaw\nful Aslemblies, where they were making their\nwaxen images, and other odd mischievous\nInventions in Black Mdglck, to torment Folks?\nWhat if I can produce such Evidence against\nyou, wrote the Father to ihim by way of\nstrengthening the Question ; will you not own\nthat we have convicted youthen ? And when\nhe had wrote the Note ,. he gave it Duncan\nCampbell, with a Look that seemed to express\nhis Warmth and Earnestness in the Expostula\ntion. Duncan Campbell took the Paper, and\nread it ; and far from being startled, returned\nthis Answer, with a Smile continuing in his*\nFace while he wrote it. \" No, said he, Fathdrsy\n\" by your Leave, they will only prove me a\nlf\ngood magician by that Oath, and themselves\nf more plainly JVttche s.

Here Mri\nCampbell related the whole Story of.hisrTrs-\nvels to her, and the Crosses and Disappoints\nments he had met with abrdad. The Tears,\nhe observ'd, would start every now and then\ninto her Eyes when fee came to any dotefoJ\nPassage, and ihe.appeafd to have a mighty\ncompassionate kind of feeling, when she read\nof any Hardship more than ordinarily me\nlancholy that had befallen him. Mr. Camp*\nbell, it is certain, had then a very good Pre\nsence, and was a handsome and portly young\nMan ; and, as a great many young Gentle\nmen derive the seeming Agreeableneis of their\nPersons from the Taylor and die Barber,\nthe Shoemaker and Hosier, so Mr. Camp\nbells Person on the other Hand gave a good\nAir and a good Look to the aukward Garb\nlie had on ; and, I believe, it was from feeing\nhim in this odd Trim (as they call it,) the\nLadies first took up the Humour of calling\nhim the handsome Sloven : Add to this, that\n\"\u25a0\u00ab \u25a0\u2022 \u2022\u2022; ! \u25a0:\u2022. .\n\u25a0\n. ..-v\n';!\n:'\nha.\n\fOf Mr. DU N\u00a3 \u00a3 N C A M P Bf E life (4-19\nhe look'd his Misfortune in the Face with a\njolly countenance, and mild even while he\nwas penning the relation of his Calamities ;\nAll- \\which are certair%Ckcurnstances, that\nfirst tooth a generous Mind into a State of\nCompassion, and afterwards heighten it in the\nBreast wherein it is cqnceiv'dv Hence it came1,\nthat this pretty: and gpofiUiatur;d; Widow,\nMrs. \u00a3>?\u00a3&, when she had expressed her Com-\nmiserataon of him by her looks, began to take\nthe Pen, and express it in verytefider Terms.\nNeither did she think that .

She\nlaid a. Purse of Twenty Guineas upon the\nTable, and at the fame Time smiling, point\ned to the Gold,, as signifying her Desire that\nhe would accept.it ; and running to the Door,\ndropped a Curt'sy, and.skuttled away : And by\nthe fame Civil, act as she oblig'd him, me\nput it out of hi$ pQWjer. to refute being so ob\nlig'd ; so that thft., .the .

Aftd thily just such; was the effect that\nthisLady'sCivility had upon Mr. Duncan Camp\nbell : He conceived from that Moment a very\ngreat affection for her, and resolved to try\nwhether he could gain her ; which he had no\nsiriall Grounds to hope, from the Esteem which\nthey appear'd to bear towards him already. I\nremember,' Mr. Dryden makes a very beauti\nful Observation, of the near Alliance there is\nbetween the Two Passions of Pity and Love\nin a Woman's Breast, in one of his Plays: His\nWords are these :\nFor Pity siillforeruns approaching Love,\nAs Lightning does the Thunder\nWb.Bmyere, k most ingenious Member of the\nFrench Academy, has made another remark,\nwhich comes home to our present purpose. He\nsays, That many Women love their money bet\nter than their tr'iends,butyetvaktetheir Lovers\nmore than their Money. According to the two\nreflections ofthese fine writers upon the Tem\npers of the Fair, Mr. Campbell had hopes e\nnoughs to ground his Courtship upon ; and it\nappeared ib in the End by his proving Suc\ncessful' ; ;\nShe from being a very liberal and\nfriendly client, became at last a most- Affe\nctionate Wife. He then began to be a House\nkeeper, and, accordingly took a little neat one, ;\n\u2022 . . and\n\fos Mr. Duncan Campbell. 141\nand very commodious for his Profession, in\nMonmouth-Court. Here I must take Leave to\nmake this observation ; That if Mr. Camp\nbell inherited the talents of his Second sight\ned Mother, he seemed likewise to be an heir\nto his Father, Mr. Archibald Campbell, both\nin his strange and accidental sufferings by\nSea, and likewise in his being reliev'd from\nthem, after as accidental and strange a man\nner, by an unexpected Marriage, just like\nhis Father's. And here we return again, to\ntake a new Survey of him, in the course of\nhis publick Practice, as a predictor. The Ac\ncounts I shall give of his actions here, will be\nVery various in their nature from any I have\nyet presented to the Reader : They are more\nmysterious in themselves ; and yet I fliall en\ndeavour to make the Manner of his operating\nin this kind, as plain, as I think I have the\nforegoing ones j and then I flatter my self,\nthey must afford a fresh Entertainment for\"\nevery Reader, that has any curiosity, and\na good Taste for Things of so extraordinary\na Kind. For what I have all along pro\npounded to my self from the Beginning, and\nin the Progress to the End of this History*\nis, to interweave entertaining and surprizing\nNarratives of what Mr, Campbell has done,\nwith curious arid instructive Enquiries into\nthe nature of those actions, for which he has\nrendered himself so singularly famous. It was\nnot therefore suitable to my Purpose, to clog\nR the\n\fi4- ~tb* Life and A-d v e n t u r t s\nthe Reader with numerous Adventures, al\nmost all of the fame Kind ; but out of a vast\nNumber of them, to single some few of those\nthat were most remarkable, and that were\nMysteries, but Mysteries of very different forts.\nI leave that Method of swelling distorted and\ncommented Trifles into Volumes, to the\nWriters of Fable and Romance : If I was to\ntell his Adventures with Regard , for Exam\nple, to Women that came to consult him j\nI might, perhaps, have not only written the\nStories of Eleven Thousand Virgins that died\nMaids, but have had Relations to give of as\nmany marry 'd Women and Widows ,\u2666 and the\nWork would have been endless. All that I\nmall do therefore, is to pick out one Particu\nlar, each of a different Kind, that there may\nbe Variety in the Entertainment. Upon Ap\nplication to this Dumb Man, one is told in\nthe Middle of her Health , that she shall die\nat such a Time ; another, that she shall sicken,\nand upon the Moment of her Recovery, have\na Suiter, and a Husband : A Third, who is a\ncelebrated Beauty, with a Multitude of Ad\nmirers round about her ; that she shall never\nbecome a Wife : A Fourth, that is marry 'd ;\nwhen flie shall get rid of an uneasy Husband :\nA Fifth, that hath lost her Goods ; who stole\nthem ; where and when they shall be resto\nred : A Sixth, that is a Merchant ; when he\nshall be undone ; and how and when he\nshall recover his Losses, and be as great on\nthe\n\fof Mr. Duncan Cam pbellI 243\nthe Exchange as ever : A Seventh, that is a>\nGamester ; which will be his winning, and\nwhich .his losing Hour : An Eighth, how he\nshall be involv a in a Law-Suit ; and whether\nthe Suit will have an adverse or a prosperous\nIssue : A Ninth, that is a Woman, with\nChoice of Lovers ; and who she shall be most\nhappy with for Life : And so on to many\nothers ; where every Prediction is perfectly\nnew and surprizing, and differs from the o-\nther in almost every Circumstance. When\na Man has so extensive a Genius as this at\nforetelling the future Occurrences of Life*\n\"one Narrative of a Sort is enough in Con\nscience to present the Reader with ; and se\nveral of each kind wpuld not (methinks) be\nentertaining, but tiresome : For he that can\ndo one Thing in these Kinds by the Power\nof Prediction , can do Ten Thousand : And\nthose who are obstinate iA extenuating his\nTalents, and calling his Capacity in Question*\nand that will not be convinc'd by one In\nstance of his Judgment, would not own the\nConviction, if Ten Thousand Instances were\ngiven them. The best Paslages I can recom\nmend to their Perusal, are those, where Per\nsons, who came purposely to banter him,\nunder the Colour of Consulting him, and\ncover'd over their\nfly\nIntentions with bor\nrows Disguizes, and came in Masquerades*\nfound all the Jest turn'd upon themselves in\nthe End, which they meant to our famous\nR\n% Pre-\n\fZ44 The Life and Adventures\npredictor ; and had the Discouragement of'\nseeing their most conceal'd and deepest-laid\nPlots discover'd , and all their most witty\nFetches and wily Contrivances defeated ; till\nthey were compell'd universally to acknow\nledge, that endeavouring to impose upon\nthe Judgment of our Seer, by any hidden\nArtifice and Cunning whatsoever, was effe\nctually imposing upon their own. His unu\nsual talent in this kind was so openly known,\nand so generally cbnfefsd, that his Know\nledge was celebrated in some of the most\nwitty Weekly papers that ever appear'd in\nPublick. Isaac Bickerjlaff, who diverted all\nthe BeauMonde for a long Space of Time with\nhis Lucubrations, takes Occasion in several of\nhis Papers, to applaud the Speculations of\nthis Dumb Gentleman, in an admirable vein\nof pleasantry and Humour, peculiar to the\nWriter, and to the subject he writ upon.\nAnd when that bright Author, who join'd\nthe uttermost Facetiousnels with the most\nsolid Improvements of Morality and Learn\ning in his Works, laid aside the Title of a*\nTattler, and asiumed the Name of a Specta\ntor, and Censor of Men's actions, he still\n( every now and then) thought our Duncan\nCampbell a subject worthy enough to em\nploy his farther Considerations upon. I must\ntake notice of one Letter sent concerning him\nto the spectator, in the Year 171 z. (N '.\n474.)\nwhich was at a Time when a Lady wanted\n4 hir%\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 245\nhim, after he had removal from Monmouth,\nfctrtet to Bwry-Lane.\nMr. Spectator,\n\"\u2022 A Bout two Years ago I was cafld upon\nJs\\^\n\" by the younger Part of a Country\n*\u2022 Family, by my Mother's Side related to\n*'- me, to visit Mr. Campbell, the dumb Man :;\n\"for they told me, that was chiefly what\n<\u00a3\nbrought them to Town, having heard\n**\nWonders of him in Essex, I, who always\n<{\nwanted Faith in such Matters, was not\n\" easily prevailed on to go ; but lesl; they\nci\nshould take it ill, I went with them ; when,\n<c\nto my own Surprize, Mr. Campbell related\nil all their past Life : (In short, had he not\n\" been prevented, such a Discovery would\n\" have come out, as would have ruin'd their\n\" next Design of coming to Town, viz.\n\" buying Wedding-Cloaths.) Our Names \u2014\n** tho' he never heard of us before, and we\n\" endeavour'd to conceal, were as familiar\n\" to him as to our selves^ To be sure, Mr.\n\" SpeUator^ he is a very learned and wise\n\" Man. Being impatient to know my For-\n-*c tune, having paid my respects in a Family\n\" Jacobin, he told me (after his manner)\n\" among several other Things, that in a Year\nK\nand Nine Months I should fall\nill\nof\na\n*l new Fever, . be given over by my Physics-\n\" ans, but mould with much difficulty re-\nR\n3\n\" cover\n:\n.r\n\f246 .The Life and Adventures\n\" cover : That the first; Time I took the Air\n*c afterwards, I should be addrefs'd to by a\n*c\nyoung Gentleman of a plentiful Fortune,\n\" good Sense, and a generous Spirit.

Let us take a Survey of him\nwhile he is wonderfully curing Persons laT\nbouring under the Misfortune of Witchcraft;\n:<of which the following Story will be an\neminent instance, and likewise clear up how\nhe came by his Reputation in Essex, as men\ntioned in the above-mentioned Letter to the\nSpectator.\nIn the Year 1709, Susanna Johnson,\nDaughter to one Captain Johnson, who liv d\nat a Place adjacent to Rumsord in Essex,\ngoing one Morning to that Town to buy\nButter at the Market, was met there by an\nold miserable looking Woman, just as she\nhad taken some of her Change of the Mar\nket-woman in Copper, and this old Woman,\nrather demanded than begg'd the Gentle\nwoman to give her a Penny. Mrs. Johnson\nreputing her to be one of those hateful People\nthat are calsd sturdy Beggars, refused it her,\nas thinking it to be no Act of Charity, and,\nthat it would be rather gratifying and indulg\ning her Impudence, than supplying or sa\ntisfying her Indigence. Upon the Refusal,\nthe old Hag with a Face more wrinkled Hill,\nif poflible, by Anger than it was by Age,\ntook upon her to storm at young Mrs. John-\nR 4\n' \"\nson\n,*\n\fJ48 The Life and Adventures\nfor very loudly, and to threaten andme^\nnace her : But when she found her common\nThreats and Menaces were of no avail, she\nswore (he would be revenged of the young\nCreature in so signal a manner, that (he\nshould repent the Denial of that Penny from\nher Heart before she got home, and that it\nshould cost her many Pounds to get rid of\nthe Consequences of that Denial and her\nAnger. The poor innocent Girl despised\nthese last Words likewise, and getting up on\nHorseback return'd Homewards ; but just\nas she got about half way her Horse stopp'd,\nand no means that she could use would make\nhim advance one single Step ; but she staid\na while to see if that would humour him\nto go on. At last the Beast began to grow\nunruly, and snorted and trembled as if he had\nseen or smelt something that frighted him,\nand so fell a kicking desperately till he threw\nthe Girl from the Saddle, not being able to\ncling to it any longer, tho' a pretty good\nHorsewoman of her Years ,\u2022 so much were\nthe Horses Motions and Plungings more than\nordinarily violent.\nAs Providence would have it she got not\nmuch harm by the Fall, receiving only a\nlittle Bruise in the right Shoulder ; but she\nwas dreadfully frighted. This Fear added\nWings to her Feet, and brought her home\n\fIf Mr. Duncan Campbell 249\nas speedily of her self as she usually came on\nHorseback. She immediately, without any\nother Sign of illness than the pallid Colour\nwith which Fear had disorder 'd the Com\nplexion of her Face, alarm'd all the family\nat home with the Story, took her Bed up\non\nit,\ncomplain'd of inward Rackings of the\nBelly, and was never at ease unless the lay\ndoubled up together her Head to her knees,\nand her Heels to her Rump, just like\na\nFi\ngure of\n8.\nShe could not be\na\nsingle Mo\nment out of that Posture without shrieking\nout with the violence of anxious Torments\nand racking pains.\nIn this Condition of Misery, amidst this\nAgony of Suffering, and in this double Po?\nsture was the poor wretched young Gentle,\nwoman brought to Town\n:\nPhysicians were\nconsulted about her but in vain\n;\nshe was\ncarry\nd\nto different hospitals for Assistance,\nbut their Endeavours likewise prov'd ineffe\nctual. At last she was conducted to the Col-\n'\nlege of Physicians\n;\nand even the collective\nwisdom of the greatest Sages and Adepts in\nthe Science of Physick was pos'd to give her\nany Prescription that would do her Service,\nand relieve her from the inexplicable Ma\nlady me labour'd under. The poor incurable\nCreature was one constant subject of he?\ncomplaining Mother's Discourse\nin\nevery com\npany (he came into.\nJt\nhappen'd at last, and ve-\n>\n\fa^o The Life and Adventures\nry providentially truly, that the Mother was\nthus condoling the Misfortune of her Child\namong five or fix Ladies, and telling them,\namong other Things, that by the most skil\nful Persons stie was looked upon to be be\nwitch d, and that 'twas not within the power\nof Physick to compass her Recovery : They\nall having been acquainted with our Mr.\nDuncan Campbell, unanimously advised her to\ncarry her Daughter to his House, and consult\nwith him about her. The Mother was over\njoy'd at these Tidings, and purposed to let no\nTime slip where her Child's Health was so\ndeeply concerned. She got the Ladies to go\nwith her and her Child, to be Eye-witnesses\nof so extraordinary a Piece of Practice, and\nso eminent a Tryal of Skill.\nAs soon as this dismal object was brought\ninto his Room, Mr. Duncan Campbell lifted\nup her Head and look d earnestly in her Face,\nand in less than a Minutes time signify d to\nthe Company, that she was not only be\nwitch d, but in as dreadful a Condition al\nmost as the Man that had a Legion of Fiends\nwithin him.\nAt the reading of these Words the unhap\npy Creature rais'd up her Head, turn'd her\nEyes upwards, and a Smile Ca Thing she\nbad been a Stranger to for many Months)\noverspread her whole Face, and such a kind\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell\/ 2.5T\nof Colour asv is the fluming of Joy and\nGladness, and with an innocent Tone of\nVoice she said, stie now had a firm belief she\nshould shortly be deliver d. The Mother and\nthe rest of the Company were all in Tears,\nbut Mr. Campbell wrote to them that they\nshould be of good Heart, be easy and quiet\nfor a few Moments, and they should be con\nvinced that it was Witchcraft, but happily\nconvinced by seeing her so suddenly welt\nagain. This brought the Company into\npretty good Temper ; and a little after Mr.\nCampbell desired stie might be led up stairs\ninto his Chamber and left there alone with\nhim for a little while ; this occasioned some\nsmall Female Speculation, and as much Mirth\nas their late Sorrow, alleviated with the hopes\nof her Cure, would permit.\nThis you may be sure was but a snatch of\nMirth, just as the nature of the thing would\nallow of ; and all forts of Waggery being\nlaid instantly aside, and remov'd almost as\nsoon as conceived, the poor young Thing was\ncarryed in that double Posture up Stairs. She\nhad not been much above half an Hour there,\nwhen by the help only of Mr. Campbell's\nArm The was led down Stairs, and descended\ninto that Room full of Company as a Miracle\nappearing in a Machine from above ; she was\nled backward and forward in the Room,\nwhile all gazed at her for a while with joy\nful\n\u25a0*\u00bb\u25a0\n*\u2022'.'\n\f%$% The Life and Adventures\nful Astonishment, for no Arrow was ever\nmore- strait than flie. Mr. Campbell then pre\nvailed with her to drink a Glass of Wine, and\nimmediately after she evacuated Wind, which\nthey had not done for some Months before, and\nfound her self still more amended and easy ;\nAnd then the Mother making Mr. Campbell\nsome small Acknowledgment at that time,\nwith the promise of more, and her Daugh\nter giving Thanks, and all the Company com\nmending his Skill, took their Leave and de\nparted with great Demonstrations ofJoy. I\nshall here, to. cut the Story, short signify, that\nshe came frequently afterwards to make her\nTestimonials of Gratitude to him, and con\ntinues to enjoy her Health to this very Day\nat Greentykh, where (he now lives, and will\nat any time, if called upon, make Oath of\nthe Truth of this little history, as flie told\nme her self with her own Mouth.\nThe next Thing therefore it behoves me\nto do in this Chapter,\nis,\nto give some satis\nfactory Account of Magick, by which such\nseeming mysterious Cures and Operations\nare brought about.\nThis task\nI\nwould perform\nin\nthe most\nperspicuous and most convincing manner\nI\ncan\n;\nfor Magick\nI\nknow\nis\nheld to be\na\nvery\nhard and difficult Study by those Learned,\nand universally unlawful and diabolical by\nthose unlearned, who believe there\nis\nsuch\na\nScience\nj -\n.-\n\fofMr. Duncan Campbell? ij}\na Science attainable by Human Genius. On\nthe other Hand, by some Learned men, who\nbelieve there is no con science, it is repre\nsented as an inconsistent System of Supersti\ntions and Chimeras ; and again laugh'd at as\nsuch by the Unlearned, who are of an incre\ndulous Temper : What I would therefore\nundertake to do in this Place, is to shew the\nLearned Men, who believe there is such an\nArt, that the Attainment to a tolerable Know\nledge of the manner how magical practices\nmay be brought about, is no such difficult\nMatter as they have represented it to them\nselves ,\u2022 and by doing this, I shall make the\nSystem of it jo plain, that while the Learn\ned approve of\nit,\nthe Unlearned too, who\nare not of an unbelieving Kind, may under\nstand clearly what\nI\nfay\n;\nand the Learned\nMen who have rejected this Science as Chi\"\ntnerical, may be clearly convinced\nit\nis\nreal\nj\nand then there\nis\nnothing left but obstinate\nunbelieving Ignorance, which\nI\nshall not here\npretend by Arguments to lead into Sense,\nbut leave\nit\nto the work of Time, In fine,\nI\nwill endeavour to induce Men of Sense to\nsay, that, what has been accounted mysteri\nous,\nis\ndelivered in\na\nplain, easy, and con\nvincing manner, and to own that they ap\nprove\n;\nwhile Men of the lower Class of Un\nderstanding, shall confess and acknowledge\nthat they themselves understand\nit,\nand that\nwhat\n\f554 The Life and Adventures\n<\nwhat has hitherto been, represented as if\nduous and difficult to a great Genius, is adap\nted and render'd not only clear, but familiar\nto Persons of middling Talents. In this Work\ntherefore I shall follow the strictest Order I\ncan (which of all Things render a Discourse\nupon any subject the most clear ; ) and that\nit may be plain to the commonest Capacity,\nI will first set down what Order I intend to\nfollow.\nFirst, I will speak of Magick in general.\nSecondly, Of Magick under its several Di\nvisions and Subdivisions.\nThirdly, concerning the object of the art,\nas it is Good or Bad.\nFourthly, Of the Persons exercising that\nArt in either Capacity of Good or Bad, and\nby what means they become capacitated to\nexercise it.\nIn the Fifth Place I shall come to the se\nveral objections against the Art of Magick,\nand the Refutation of those objections.\nThe first objection shall be against the Ex\nistence of good and bad Spirits. The Refu\ntation of which will consist in my proving\nthe Existences of Spirits both Good and Bad,\nby Reason, and by Experience.\nThe second objection that will be brought,\nis to contain an Allegation that there are no\nsuch Persons as Witches now, and an Ar\ngument to support that allegation, drawn\nfrom the Incapacity and Impossibility of any\nThings\nV .<\n\fos Mr. Duncan Campbell^, zfj\nThing's making (while it self is incarnate) a\ncontract with a Spirit. This objection will\nbe answer\n'd,\nby proving the Reality of Witches\nfrom almost Universal Experience\n;\nand by\nexplaining rationally the Manner how the\nDevils hold Commerce with Witches\n:\nWhich\nExplication\nis\nback'd, and authoriz'd,\nby\nthe\nOpinion of the most Eminent Divines, and\nthe most Learned Physicians.\nFrom hence, Sixthly and Lastly\n,\nWe\nShall conclude on the Side of the good Ma\ngick, that as there are Witches on the one\nhand, that may afflict and torment Persons\nwith Demons\n;\nso, on the other hand, there\nare lawful and good Magicians, that may cast\nout Damons from people that are poflefs'd\nwith them.\nAnd, First, As to Magick in general\n:\nMa\ngick consists in the Spirit by Faith\n;\nfor Faith\nis\nthat Magnet of the Magicians\n,\nby\nwhich they draw Spirits to them, and\nby\nwhich\nSpirits they do great Things, that appear like\nMiracles.\nSecondly\n,\nMagick\nis\ndivided into Three\nSorts\n;\nviz. Divine, Natural, zn&Diabolical.\nAnd Natural Magick\nis\nagain subdivided in\nto Two Kinds, Simple and Compound\n:\nAnd\nNatural Compound Magick\nis\nagain likewise\ndivided into Two Kinds\n;\nviz. Natural Di\nvine Magick, and Natural Diabolical Ma\ngick.\nNow\n\f\\$6 . The Life and Adventures\nNow to give the Reader a clear, and a di\nstinct Notion of each several Species of Mu\nstek here raention'd, I set down the following\ndefinitions. \u2014Divine Magick is a Celestial Sci\nence, in which all Operations that are won\nderfully brought about, are performed by\nthe Spirit of God.\u2014 Natural Magick is a\nScience, in which all the mysterious acts\nthat are wrought, are compalsd by Natural\nSpirits.- But as this Natural Magick may\nbe exercised about Things, either in a manner\nindifferent in themselves, or mere morally\ngood, and then it is mere Natural Magick ;\nor else about Things Theologically good, and\ntranseendently bad ; and then it is not mere\nly Natural Magicky but Mix'd and Com\npound. If Natural Magick be exercised a-\nbout the most Holy Operations , it is then\nmix'd with the Divine, and may then be cal\nled Cnot improperly.) Natural Divine Magick.\nBut if Natural Magick troubles it self about\n\u2022compassing the wickedest Practices, then is\nit promiscuous with the Demoniacal, and may\nnot improperly be called Natural Diabolical\n'Magick.\nThirdly, The Object of this Art is doing\nWonders out of the ordinary appearing Course\nof Nature, which tend either to great Good\nor Bad, by the Help and Mediation of Spirits\ngood and bad.\nPourthlji\n\fof Mr. Duncan' sPit\" 257\n'Fourthly, As to the Persons exercising that\nArt in either way, whether good or bad, and\nby what Means they become capacitated to\nact it ; the Notion of this may be easily de\nduced from the Notions of the Art it self,\nas considered above in its each different Spe\ncies : For as all Magick consists in a Spirit,\nevery Magician acts by a Spirit.\nDivine Magicians, that are of God, are spo\nken of in Holy Writ ; and therefore I shall\nnot mention the Passages here, but pass them\nover (as I ought in a book like this) with a\nprofound and reverential Silence , as well as\nthe other passages, which speak of natural\nand D\u0153moniacal Magicians ; and in all I shall\nspeak of them in this Place, I shall only\nspeak of them with Regard to Human Rea\nson and Experience, and conclude this Head\nwith saying, That Natural Magicians work\nplay things by the Natural Spirits of the Ele\nments ; but that Witches and D\u0153moniacal Ma\ngicians , as Jannes and Jambres in \u00c6gypt\nwere, work their Magical Performances by\nthe Spirit of Demons : And 'tis by the Means\nof these different Spirits, that these diffe\nrent Magicians perform their different Ope\nrations.\nThese Things thus distinctly settled and ex\nplains, 'tis now we must come and ground\nthe Dispute, between those who believe there\nare no such Things as Magicians of any Kind,\nS\n'\nand\n\f158 The LieE and Adtentur.es\nand those who assert there are of all the Kinds\nabove specify 'd.\nThose who contend there are, have Re\ncourse to Experience, and relate many well-\nwitnessd Narratives, to prove, that there have\nbeen in all Times, and that there are Hill\nMagicians of all these Kinds : But those, who\ncontend that there are no such Persons, will\ngive no Ear to what the others call plain Expe\nrience : They call the Stories 0et whatever\nWitnesses appear to justify them) either fabu\nlous Legends, invented by the Authors, or\nelse Tricks of intellectual Legerdeniain, im\nposed by the Actors, upon the Relators of\nthose Actions. Since therefore, they fay,\ntho' the Believers in Magick brag of Expe\nrience never so much , it may be but a fal\nlible Experience ; they reasonably desire to\nknow, whether these Gentlemen that stand\nfor Magick, can answer the Objections which\nthey propose, to prove, that the Practice of\nMagick, according to the System laid down,\nis inconsistent with Reason, before they will\nyield their Assent ? Let the Stories be never so\nnumerous, appear never so credible, these un\nbelieving Gentlemen desire to be try'd by Rea\nson, and aver till that Reason is given, they\nwill not be convinc'd by the Number of Sto\nries,- because, tho' numerous, they are Stories\nstill ; neither will they believe them, because\ntliey appear credible : Because seeming so, is\nnot\n\fof Mr. DuncanCampbell Z59\nnot being so ; and Appearances, tho' never\nso fair, when they contradict Reason, are not\nto be swallowed down with an implicit Faith\nas\nGer\nmany Realities. And thus far, no doubt*\nthe Gentlemen, who are on the unbelieving\nSide, are very much in the right on't. The\nlearned gentlemen, on the other hand, who\nare persuaded of this mighty mysterious Pow\ner being lodged in the hands of magicians,\nanswer, That they will take upon them to re\nfute the most subtle objections, brought by\nthe learned Unbelievers, and to reconcile the\n'Practicability of Magical Mysteries by the Ca\npacity of Men, who study that Art, to right\nRules and Laws of Reasoning\n;\nand to shew,\nthat some Stories (tho' never\nso\nprodigi\nous\nJ\nwhich are told of Magicians, demand\"\nthe Belief of Wise Men on Two Accounts\n:\nBecause^ as Experience backs Reason on the\none hand, Reason backs Experience on the\nother\n;\nand\nso\nthe issue of the whole Argu\nment (\"whether there are magicians or not)\nis\nthrown upon both Experience and Reason.\nThese arguments on each Side,\nI\nshall draw\nup fairly Pro and Con\n;\nfor\nI\ndon't pretend to\nbe the Inventor of them my self\n;\nthey belong\nto other Authors many Years ago\n:\nBe\nit\nenough\nfor me to boast of,\nif\nI\ncan draw them up\nin\na\nbetter and closer Form together, than they\nhave yet appear'd\nin\n:\nIn that\nI\ntake upon my\nself\na\nvery great Task\n;\nI\nerect my self as\nit\nwere\nS\n%\n\u2022\ninto\n\fx6o The Life and Adventures\ninto a kind of a Judge : I will sum up the\nevidence on both sides ; and I shall, where-\never I see Occasion, intimate which Side of\nthe Argument bears the most Weight with\nme. But when I have enforc'd my Opinion\nas far as I think needful, my Readers (like a\nJury) are still at Liberty to bring in their Ver\ndict, just as they themselves shall fee fit. And\nthis naturally leads me , where I promised to\ncome to in the Fifth Part of this Discourse, to\nthe several objections against the Power of\nArt Magick, and the Refutation of those Ob\njections.\nThe First Ohje&ion being againjl the Exi\nstence of Spirits, and the Refutations\nthereof.\nTH\nE First Objection, which they who\nreject Magick make use of, is, deny\ning that there are any such Things as Spirits ;\nabout which, since those who defend the\nArt, fay it entirely exerciseth it self, the Ob\njectors contend, That if they can make out\nthat there are no such Beings as Spirits, all\npretensions to the Art must be entirely ground\nless, and for the future exploded.\nTo make this Part out, that there are no\nSpirits ; the first Man they produce on their\nSide, is undoubtedly one of very great Cre\ndit and Authority, inasmuch as he has justly\nborn for many centuries the Title of the\nPrince\n\fof Mr. DuncanCampbell z6t\nPrince of Philosophers. They fay, that Aristo\ntle, in his Book deMundo, reasons thus against\nthe Existence of Spirits ; via.' .'That since God\nf can do all Things of himself, he doth not\n1\nstand in need of Ministering Angels and Da-\n' mons : A Multitude of Servants shewing\nf the Weakness of a Prince.\nThe Gentlemen who defend the science,\nmake this reply : They allow the Credit and\nAuthority of Aristotle, as much as the Ob\njectors ,\u2022 but as the objectors themselves de\nny all the Authorities for the Spirits, and de\nsire that Reason may be the only Ground\nthey go upon, so the refuters, on their Parts,\ndesire, that Ariftotle's\u2014ipse dixit may not be\nabsolutely pafs'd upon them for Argument ;\nbut that his Words may be brought to the\nfame Touchstone of Reason, and prov'd if\nthey are Standard. If this Argument, fay\nthey, will hold good, Aristotle should not\nsuppose Intelligences moving the Celestial\nSpheres ; for God sufficeth to move all with\nout Ministring Spirits ; nor would there be\nneed of a Sun in the World, for God can\nenlighten all Things by himself ; and so all\nSecond Causes were to be taken away : There\nfore there are Angels and Ministring Spirits\nin the World, for the Majesty of God, not\nfor his Want of them j and for Order, not\nfor his Omnipotency. And here, if the Ob\njectors return, and fay, Who told you that\nthere are Spirits 3 Is not yours a precarious\nS 3 Hjrpo-\n\fz6z The Life and Apventub.es\nHypothesis i Mayn't we have Leave to recri\nminate in this Place >\nPray, who told Aristo\ntle, that there were Intelligences that mov'd\nthe Celestial Spheres ? Is not this Hypothesis\nas precarious , as any Man may pretend that\nof Spirits to be ? And we believe there are\nfew Philosophers at present, who agree with\nAristotle in that Opinion : And we dare pro\nnounce this to be ours, that Aristotle took his\nIntelligences from the Hebrews, who went\naccording to the fame whimsical (tho' pretty)\n'Notion, which first gave Rife to the fiction\nof the Nine Muses. But more than all this, it\nis a very great Doubt among learned Men, whe\nther this Book, De Mundo, be Aristotle 's or no.\nThe next Thing the Objectors bring a\ngainst the Existence of Spirits,\nis,\nThat\nit\nis\nNonsense for Men to say; that there are\nsuch Beings, of whichTit\nis\nimpossible for\na\nMan to have any Notion\n;\nand they insist up\non\nit,\nthat\nit\nis\nimpossible for any man to form\nan Idea of\na\nSpiritual Substance. As to this\nPart, the Defendants rejoin, That they think\nour late most judicious Mr. Locke, in his ela\nborate and finifh'd Essay on Human Under\nstanding, has fairly made out, that men have as-\nclear\na\nNotion of a Spiritual Substance, as they\nhave of any corporeal Substance, Matter, or\nBody\n;\nand that there\nis\nas much Reason for\nadmitting the existence of the one, as of the\nother\n;\nfor that\nif\nthey admit the lattery\nit\nis\nbut Humour\nin\nthem to deny the former. It\nis\n\fpfMr. Duncan Campbell 265\nis in his second Book, Chap.zy. where he rea\nsons thus :\n\" If a Man will examine himself,\nconcerning his Notion of pure substance in\ngeneral, he will find he has no other idea of\nit, but only a supposition of he knows not\nwhat Support, of such qualities which are ca\npable of producing simple Ideas in us; which\nQualities are, commonly, called accidents.\nThus\nif;\nwe talk or think of any particular\nSort of Corporeal Substance, as Horse, Stone,\n&c. tho' the Idea we have of either of them\nbe but the Complication or collection of\nthose several simple Ideas, or sensible Quali\nties, which we use to find united in the Thing\ncall'd Horse or Stone\n;\nyet because we can\nnot conceive how they should subsist alone\nnot in one another, we suppose them to ex\nist in, and be supported by some common Sub\nject\n;\nwhich Support we denote by the Name\nof Substance\n;\ntho'\nit\nbe certain, we have no\nclear or distinct Idea of that Thing we sup\npose\na\nSupport. The lame happens concern\ning the Operations of our Mind, viz. Think\ning, Reasoning, and Fearing, &c. which we\nconcluded not to subsist of themselves, and\nnot apprehending how they can' belong to\nBody\n;\nwe are apt to think these the Acti\nons of some substance, which we call Spirit:\nWhereby it's evident, that having no other\nNotion of Matter, but something, wherein\nthose many sensible qualities, which affect our\nsenses, do subsist, by supposing\na\nSubstance,\nS\n4\nwhere\n\fi^4 The Life and Adv e ntur.es\nwherein Thinking, knowing, doubting, and a\nPower of Moving, &c. do subsist ; we have as\nclear a notion of the Nature or Substance of\nSpirit, as we have of Body ; the one being\nsupposed to be, without knowing what is\nthe Substratum to those simple ideas which\nwe have from without, and the other supposed\n( with a like Ignorance of what it is ) to be\nthe substratum of these Operations which we\nexperiment in our selves within. Tis plain,\nthen, that the Idea of Corporeal Substance\nin Matter, is as remote from our Concepti\nons and Apprehensions, as that of Spiritual\nSubstance ; and therefore, from our not having\nany Notion of the Substance of Spirit, we can\nno more conclude its Non-Existence, than we\ncan for the fame Reason deny the Existence\nof Body ; it being as rational to affirm there\nis no Body, because we cannot know its Es\nsence, as it is called, or have the Idea of the\nSubstance of Matter, as to fay, there is no\nSpirit, because we know not its Essence, or\nhave no Idea of a Spiritual Substance.\" Mr.\nLocke also, comparing our Idea of Spirit with\nour Idea of Body, thinks there may seem ra-\nther less Obscurity in the former than the\nlatter. Our Idea of Body, he takes to be\nan extended solid substance, capable of com\nmunicating Motion by Impulse I and our Idea\nof Soul is a Substance that thinks, and has a\nPower of exciting Motion in Body, by Will\nor Thought. Now, some perhaps will fay,\nthey\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell z\u00a3j\nthey comprehend a thinking Thing which\nperhaps is true ; but, he lays, if they con\nsider it well, they can no more comprehend\nan extended Thing ; and if they lay, they\nknow not what it is thinks in them, they\nmean they know not what the substance is\nof that thinking Thing ; no more, lays he,\ndo they know what the substance is of that\nsolid Thing ; and if they fay, they know\nnot how they think, he lays, neither do\nthey know how they are extended, how the\nsolid Parts are united, or where to make Ex\ntension, &c.\nThe learned Monsieur U CUrt, who gene\nrally knows how far human Reason can bear,\nargues consonantly to what is before deliver d\nby Mr. Locke in his Coronis, added to the\nFourth Volume of his Philosophical Works,\nin the third Edition ofthem, where he writes\nas followeth.\nWhen we contemplate the corporeal Na\nture, we can fee nothing in it but Exten\nsion, Divisibility, Solidity, Mobility, and va\nrious Determinations of Quantity or figure, >\nwhich being so, it were a ralh Thing, and\ncontrary to the Laws of right Reasoning, to\naffirm other Things of Bodies ; and conse\nquently from mere Body, nothing can be\ndeduced by us, which is not joined in a nc-\nceslary Connexion with the laid Propcrtic* :\nTherefore those, who have tlionglit the Pro\nperties\n\fx66 The Life and Adventure s\nperries of perceiving by sense, of under\nstanding, Willing, Imagining, remembering,\nand others the like, which have no Affinity\nwith corporeal Things,to have risen from the\nBody, have greatly transgressed in the Me\nthod of right Reasoning and Philosophising,\nwhich hath been done by Epicurus, and\nthose, who have thought as he' did, having\naffirmed our Minds to be composed of cor\nporeal Atoms : But whence shall we fay they\nhave had their rifle ? Truly, they do not\nowe their Rife to Matter which is wholly\ndestitute. of Sense and Thought, nor are they\nspontaneously sprung up from nothing, it\nbeing an ontological Maxim . of most evident\nTruth, that nothing springs from nothing.\nHaving thus given the reader the primary\nobjections made against the Existence of\nSpirits, and the refutations thereof, I must\nnow frankly own on which side my opinion*\nleans, and for my Part, it seems manifest to\nme that 'there are two beings, we conceive\nvery plainly and distinctly, viz. Body and\nSpirits and that it would be as absurd and\nridiculous to deny the existence of the one;\nas of the other : And really, if the refuters\nhave got the better in their way of Rea\nsoning, they have still a much greater Ad\nvantage over the objectors, \"when they come\nto back these Reasons with fresh arguments*\ndrawn from Experience, Of this, there ha\n\u25a0\nving\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell^ x6j\nving been many undoubted Narratives given\nin the foregoing Pages, concerning the Ap\nparitions of Spirits, I shall refer the Reader\nback again to them, and only subjoin here\none or two instances, which may, if re\nquired, be proved upon Oath, of Spirits\nseen by two Persons of our Duncan Campbell's\nown Acquaintance. In the year; 17 ii, one\nMrs. Stephens, and her daughter, were to\ngether with Mr. Campbells at the House of\nMr. Ramell's, a very great and noted Weaver\nat Haggerftone, where the rainy Weather de\ntained them till late at night. Just after the\nClock struck twelve, they aJlof. them went\nto the Door to fee if the Rain had ceased,\nbeing extreamly desirous to get home. A\u00a3\nsoon as ever they had opened, the Door and\nwere all got together, there appeared before\nthem a Thing all in White, the Face seemed\nof a dismal pallid Hue, but the Eyes thereof\nfiery and flaming like Beacons, and of a\nsaweer Size. It made its Approaches to\nthem, till it came up within the Space\nof about three Yards of them, there it fixt\nand stood like a Figure agaze for some Mi\nnutes ; and they all stood likewise stiff like\nthe Figure, frozen with Fear, Motionless, and\nSpeechless : When all of a sudden it vanifh'd\nfrom their Eyes ; and that Apparition to the\nSight was succeeded by a Noise, or the Ap\npearance of a Noise like that which is occa-\n\u2022 - sioned\n\u2022\n\f268 The Life and Adventures\nsioned by the Fighting of twenty MastiffDogs.\nNot long after, Mrs. Anne Stephens, who\nlived in Spittlefields, a Woman well known\nby her great Dealings with Mercers upon\nLudgate-Hill, fitting in her House alone, and\n. musing upon Business, happened by Accident\nto look behind her, and (aw a dead Corps, to\nher thinking, lie extended upon the Floor,\njust as a dead Corps should be, excepting\nthat the Foot of one Leg was fix'd on the\nGround as it is in a Bed, when one lies with\none Knee up ; she looked at it a long while,\nand by degrees at last stole her Eyes from so\nunpleasing and unexpected an Object. How\never, a strange kind of a curiosity overcome\nher Fears, and (he ventured a second Time to\nturn her Head that Way, and saw it as before,\nfix'd for a considerable time longer, but\ndurst not stir from her Seat ; she again with\ndrew her Eyes from the horrible and melan\ncholy spectacle, and resumed the Courage,\nafter a little Reflection, of viewing it again,\nand resolving to ascertain her self if the Vi\nsion was real, by getting up from her Seat\nand going to\nit,\nbut upon this third Retro\nspection lhe found\nit\nvanish\nd.\nThis Relation\nshe writ down to Mr. Duncan Campbell, and\nhas told before Mrs. Ramell, her own Sister,\nand many other very creditable Persons. Now\nas to these Arguments from Experience,\nI\nshall also deliver my opinion.\nI\ndispute not\nbut that Learned Men, who have obstinate\nPrepos-\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell\" 169\nPrepossessions, may produce- plausible Argu\nments, why all Things should be thought to\nbe done by imposture which Teem strange to\nthem, and interfere with their Belief; and\ntruly thus far their Humour may be indulged,\nthat if only one Person relates a very strange\nand surprizing Story, a Man may be more\napt to think it is possible for that Person to liey\nthan that so firange a relation should be\ntrue ; but if a considerable Number of Per\nsons of several Countries, several religions,\nseveral Professions, several ages, and those\nPersons look'd upon to be of as great Saga\ncity as any the Country afford, agree in Re\nlations of the fame Kind, tho' very strange,\nand are ready to vouch the Truth of\nthem upon Oath after having well con\nsidered Circumstances ; I think it a Vio\nlation of the Law of Nature to reject all\nthese Relations as fabulous, merely upon a\nself-presuming Conceit; unless a man can fair\nly shew the Things to be impossible, or can\ndemonstrate wherein those Persons were im\nposed on ; for, from hence I form (the fol\nlowing conclusive Argument. What is pos\nsible according to Reason grows probable ac\ncording, to Belief, where the possibility is\nattested to have reduced it self into action\nby Persons of known Credit and integrity.\nNow, not only the possibility of the Ex\nistence of Spirits, but the actual Existence\nthereof is proved above by Logical Demon\nstration i\n.\u2022\n\f470 The Life and Adventures\nstration ; therefore are we to believe both by\nthe Course of Logical Reason, and Moral\nFaith, that those Existences have appeared to\nMen of Credit, who have attested the Re\nality thereof upon Oath. f\nThe Second ObjeSion against the Existence\nos Witches.\nTHESE\nObjectors go on to fay, that\nprovided they should allow there is\nan Existence of Spirits, yet that would be\nstill no Argument how Magick should subsist*\nbecause they deny that it is possible for a\nMan in his Body to have a Commerce, much\nless make a contract with Spirits. But here\nagain the Resuters alledge they have both\nexperience and Reason on their Sides. As\na joint Argument of Reason and Experience,\nthey tell you, that the numerous Witches\nwhich have in all Countries been arraigned\nand condemned upon this Occasion, are evi\ndent Testimonies of this Commerce and\nContract being held and made with Spirits*\nThey pretend to fay, that these objectors\ncall not (theirJ the Refusers Judgment so\nmuch in question, who contend that there\nis a Magick Art, as they call in question the\njudgment of all the wisest Legislative Powers\nin Christendom, who have universally agreed\nin enacting penal Laws against such capital\noffenders.\nBut\n\f\u2022\nof Mr. Duncan Campbell zyi\nBut here the Objectors return and fay, that\nit being impossible for us to mew the manner\nhow iucli-a Contract should be made, we can\nnever, but without Reason, believe a Thing\nto be, of which we can form no perfect\nIdea. The Refusers, on the other Hand, re\nply with the learned Father le Brune ; it is\nmanifest, that we can fee but two Sorts of\nbeings^ Spirits and Bodies, and that since we\ncan reason but according to our own Ideas,\nwe ought to ascribe to Spirits what cannot be\nproduced by Bodies. Indeed, the Author of\nthe . Nouvel\/es de la Republique des Lettres,\nfor the Month of August, Anno i6%6, has\ngiven us a rough Draught for writing a good\nTract of Witchcraft, which he looks upon\nas a desideratum, Where among other Things\nhe writes thus j Since this Age is the true\ntime of Systems, one should be contriv'd\nconcerning the Commerce that may be be\ntwixt D\u00e6mons and Men.\nOn this Paslage, Father le Brune writes\nthus, \" Doubtless here the Author complies\nwith the Language of a great many Persons*\nwho, for want of Attention and Light, would\nhave us put all Religion into Systems. What\never Regard I ought to have for many of\nthose Persons, I must not be afraid to fly,\nthat there is no System to be made of those\ntruths, which we ought to learn distinctly .\nby Faith, because we must advance nothing\nhere,\ns\n\f\u00bb7\u00bb The Life and Adventures\nhere, but what we receive from the Oracle.\"\nWe must make a System to explain the Ef\nfects of the Loadstone, the Ebbing and Flow\ning of the Sea, the Motion of the Planets ;\nfor that the Cause of these effects is not evi\ndently signified to us, and many may be con\nceived by us ; and to determine us, we have\nneed of a great Number of Observations,\nwhich, by an exact Induction, may lead us to\na Cause that may satisfy all the Pbaenomena.\nIt is not the fame in the Truths of Religion,\nwe come not at them by groping, it were\nto be wisiYd Men spoke not of them, but\nafter a decisive and infallible Authority. It is\nthus we should speak of the Power of De\nmons, and of the Commerce they have with\nMen ; it is of Faith that they have Power, and\nthat they attack Men, and try to seduce them\ndivers Ways. It is true indeed, they are\nsometimes permitted to have it over the Just,\ntho' they have knot ordinarily, but over those\nthat want Faith, or Fear, not to partake of\ntheir Works ; and that to the last particular\nly, the disordered Intelligences try to make\nexactly succeed what they wish ; inspiring\nthem to have Recourse to certain practices by\nwhich those seducing Spirits enter into Com\nmerce with Men. Thus far Father le Brune.\nBut still these objectors demand to know, by\nwhat Means this Commerce may be held be\ntween D\u00e6mons and Men, and urge us to de\nscribe the Manner ; or pretend that they have\nstill\n\fof Mr. Duncan' sPBfeiLi ty%'\nstill Reason to refuse coming into the belief\nof a Thing, which we would impose upon\nthem, tho' wholly ignorant of it our selves.\nTo that, the Refuters answer thus : That both\nChristian Divines and Physicians agree,' (as\nto the Manner how, which they are so curi\nous in enquiring after J) that Dam&ns stir up\nRapture* and Pastes in Men, binding or\nloosing the exterior'Senses 5 and that either by\nstopping the PoreS'O'f the Brain, so that the\nspirits cannot pass forth, -\nfas it is done natu-\nrally asleep J or by recalling the sensitive\nSpirits,\/ \/from the outward Senses to the in\nward organs, which he rliere retains : So the\nDevil renders Sextatical and\nmagicians; who, while they lie fast asleep\nin;\none Plade, think they have been in divers Pla\nces, and done many Things. This, the learned\nObjectors lay, proceeds from no Damon, but\nfrom the Disease call'd an Epilepsy. But, on\nthe other hand, the-rnore learned Refuters\ninsist updnk, that 'these tsare not \u00a3pi~\nleptick seizures\n:\nThis, fay they, appears from\nBodin, in his Theatre\nof\nUniversal Nature\n;\nwhere he fays,\n\" That those that are wrapt\n\" by the Devil, fees neither .Stripes norCut-\n*\ntings, \/nor no Westing of their limbs, nor\nK\nburning- Tortures, hor the Application of\n\"\na\nred-hot iron\n;\nMy, nor\nis\nthe Beat of\n\" the Pulse, nor the Motion of the Heart per-\n\" ceived in them\n;\nbut afterwards, returning\n\" to themselves\n,\nthey feel most bitter Pains\nT M\n\fx74 The Life and Adventures\n\" of the Wounds receiv'd, and tell of Things\n\" done at Six Hundred Miles distance, and af-\n\" firm themselves to have seen them done.\"\nThe ingenious Dr. Ader makes an admirable\nPhysical Distinction between this Kind of Ex-\ntajy , and a syncope, or Stupor, caused by\nNarcotick Medicines. Sennertus, in his In-\njlitutio Mediai, writes of the Demoniacal So\npor of Witches, who think they are carry d\nthro' the Air, dance, feast, and have Copula\ntion with the Devil, and do other Things in\ntheir Sleep ; and afterwards believe the lame\nthings waking. Now, he fays,\n\" Whether\n\" they are really so carry 'd in the Air, &c. or\n*'\nbeing in a profound Sleep, or only dream\n\" they are so carry d, and persist in that Opi-\n**\nnion after they are awake ; these facts or\n\" Drearqs, cannot be natural : For it cannot\n\" be, that there should be so great an Agree-\n\" ment in Dreams , of Persons differing in\n\" Place, Temperament, Age, Sex, and Stu-\n\" dies, that in one Night, and at the fame\n\" Hour, they should, in Concert, dream of\n\" one and the fame such Meeting ; and should\n\" agree as to the Place, number, and Qua-\n\" lity of the Persons, and the like Circura-\n\" stances : But such Dreams are suggested\n\" from a preternatural cause, viz. from the\n\" Devil to his Confederate, by the Divine\n\" Permission of an Almighty Power , where\n\" Punishments are to be permitted to be jn-\n\" flicted upon reprobate Sinners.\nWhence\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell. 175\"\nWhence also, to those Witches sincerely\nconverted, and refusing to be any more pre\nlent at those diabolical Meetings, those Dreams\nno longer happen ; which is a Proof that they\nproceeded, not before, from a natural Cause.\nHere begins the great Point of the Dispute,\nas to that Branch of Magick , which we call\nNatural Magick. The Objectors may tell us,\nthat they will freely own, that there may\nbe an Existence of Spirits j that there may\nbe an Existence of Witches ; that by a divine\nPower, Men may be influenc'd so far, as to\nhave a Communication with good Spirits, and\nthat from thence they may become spiritual,\ndivine Magicians. They will likewise, perhaps,\nas freely grant, that by the Intervention of a\nDamon, Things preternatural may be brought\nabout by Persons who have studied the D<e-\nmoniacal Magick ; but then, what they prin\ncipally insist upon ,\nis,\nthat\nit\nmust be con\ntradictory to all Human Reason to imagine,\nthat there can be such\na\nThing as Natural\nMagicians\n:\nAnd thus far they may form their\nargument. They (ay, that the Persons who\ncontend for the Magick Art, own, that all\nthat\nis\nbrought about\nby\nMagick,\nis\nby the\nAssistance and Help of\na\nSpirit\n;\nand that\nconsequently, what\nis\neffected by\nit,\nmust be\npreternatural. Now, fay they,\nit\nis\na\nThing\ninconsistent by\na\nNatural Power, to bring\nabout\na\npreternatural Effect\n;\ntherefore, there\nT\nt\nt\ncan\n\f276 The Life and A d v e tq tr.tiR. E&\ncan be no such Thing as Natural Magick,\nwhich has within it self the Efficacy of de\nstroying those acts done by magicians, in the\nDiabolical. :. ,.\u2022;.;..\nTo this, the Refuters take Leave to reply,\nThat the foundation upon which the Argu\nment is built, is wrong grounded::. They have\nadmitted, that in Diabolical Art'J&agkk, there\nmay be a Commence held between Men and\nSpirits, by which several after effects\nmay be brought about : And the Reason they\nassign for it there,\nis,\nBecause there\nis\na\npre\nternatural Agertt concern\n'd\ntherein^ the Devil\n:\nBut then, fay they,\nin\nNatural Magick, you\ncan pretend to no such agent, and there\nfore to no such preternatural effect. This\nargument contains within itTwo Ealhcies\n:\nfirst, As to the Commerce\" held between\na\nMan and\na\nDamon, there\nis\nnothing pre\nternatural\nin\ngetting the Acquaintance\n:\nThe\nWill of the man\nis\nentirely natural ; either\nnaturally good, -or\" naturally corrupted. The\nblack spirit that ConVerseth with him,\nit\nis\nacknowledge\nis\nnot\nso\n;\nbut\nit\nis\nfrom the\nWill of the man, not from the Power vested\nin\nthcDevil, thatthe'Acquaintance first grows,\ntherefore die Acquaintance\nit-\n(elf is natural,\ntho' it arises from the last Corruption and De\npravations of NattJre\n,\u2022\nbut being made with\n\u2022\nar preternatural Existence, tho' the Cause of\nthe Acquaintance be corruptedly natural, yet\nthe intermediate Cause -or Means after that\nAcquain-\n4\n\fos Mr. Duncan Campbell? zyf\nAcquaintance is not so, and thereforejthe Ef\nfect of that intermediate Cause may be woii-\nderful, and seem to be out of the ordinary\nCourse of Nature. Now, since it is gene\nrally allow'd, that there are Natural Spirits\nof the Elements, as well as Divine and In\nfernal ; what we haVe to prove , is only\nthis ; That Man, by Natural Magick, may\nhave a Commerce with Natural Spirits of their\nElements, as Witches may have with the\nSpirits, ox D\u00e6mons. Now, 'as we said before,\nthe Commerce it self depends upon the Will\nof the Person, and is therefore natural, and\nconsequently may as well subsist between the\none as the other ; for the Devil cannot force\na. Man to hold a Commerce with him whe\nther he will or no. The: Second Fallacy\nis,\ncalling the Effect preternatural\n,\nno other\nwise than as\nit\nconnotates the Agent that\nbrought\nit\nabout, which\nis\na\nspiritual Agent!:\nFor the Effect\nis\n(in\nit\nself confider'd) natural,\nand brought about by Second Causes that are\nnatural\n;\nby\nthe Devil's Penetration,' who\nfe\nsubtle enough to make use of them for such,\nand such Ends. Now Men* by Natural Spi\nrits, which are of\na\nFaculty thoroughly' sub\ntle, may as well with Natural Second Causes\ncompass the Remedy of an Evil Spirit, as the\nDevil\nis\nable to infect Men with it. From\nthese Speculations,\na\nfarther plain Consequence\nmay be dedue'd, How\na\nMan may, by the pure\nForce of Natural Magick, cure\na\nPerson that\nT\n5\nis\n\fxyS The Life and Adventur es\nis infested with Evils by a Damon : For how\nis\nit,\nthat\na\nDamon infests any body with his\nevil Motions\n?\nIt\nis\ntrue, he\nis\na\npreternatural A-\ngent\n;\nbut the evil effect he does,\nis\nbrought\nabout\nby\nNatural Causes. For how does\na\nD<\u00ab-\nmon stir up Raptures or Extafics\nin\nMen\n?\nWhy,\nhe docs\nit\n(as we are told above\n)\nby\nbind\ning or loosing the Exterior Senses, by stop\nping the Pores of the Brain,\nso\nthat the Spi\nrits cannot pals forth\n:\nAnd this the Art of\nPh) sick can compass by its Drugs\nj\nand Sleep\ncauses the fame Thing very naturally of\nit\nself:\nTherefore as the Evil\nit\nself\nis\nnatural, the Re\nmedy, that\nis\nnatural, will certainly over\ncome it. But then, fay you, why can't those\nPersons be cur\nd\nby Physicians\n?\nI\nanswer\n;\nNot because their Remedies are not in them\nselves sufficient to cure the Evils themselves\n;\nbut because, generally, Physicians don't ad\nminister their Drugs as Christians, but as Phy\nsicians\n;\nand when they prescribe them to the\nSick, they generally prescribe to them only,\npurely considers as Patients, not as Christians\n;\nand therein they come to fail\n:\nBecause the\nAgent, the Devil,\nis\na\nsubtle Spirit, that brings\nthe Evil, and alters its Situation before the\nRemedy (which would master\nit\notherwise\ncan take any effect\n:\nWhich Agent, the Devil,\nis\nemploy\nd\nby\nthe horrible and impious Faith\nof the Anti-Physician, viz* the black Magi\ncian. But\nif\nthe physician would act the Chri\nstian, at the fame Time,\nso\nfar as to have\na\nFaith\n\fof Mr. Duncan Ca mpb el l. z79\nFaith that Things ordain'd in the Course of\nNature, for the Good of Man, would have\nits effects in Spite of a Devil, if taken with\na good Faith by the Patient : That all good\nthings, ordain'd to be for the natural Re\ncovery of Men, if they took it with Thank\nfulness to the Sender, would have due effect :\nWhy then the Natural Spirits of the Elements\nwould resist the farther Agency of the De\nmoniacal Spirit ; and then nothing but the\nNatural Evil (caused at first by the Damon)\nremaining in the Person, without the farther\nSuperintendency of the Demon , might de\nmonstratively be taken away by the mere na\ntural Remedy or Medicine. And thus good\nand pious Physicians, making use of such pro\nper Remedies as their Skill teaches them, and\nhaving an honest Faith, that the Goods of\nNature, (intended for the Use and Benefit of\nMan) if receiv'd by the Patient with the same .\nGood Faith, is above the Power of the Devil to\nfrustrate, may not improperly be called Natu\nral Magicians. These Arguments of mine, I\nshall now take Leave to back by experience.\nBesides what we have urged from Rea\nson, concerning the power of natural Ma-\ngick, we shall only subjoin, that divines\nthemselves hold that Natural-Magick , and\nalso Natural-Divinations and Prophecies , are\nproved by quotations from that Venerable\nWrit which is their Guide ; and bring Proofs\nfrom the lame also, that by Natural Magick ,\ni : T 4 D\u00e6mon t\n\fa8o The Life and Act e ktur.es\nDamons are also cast forth, but not all kinds\nof Damons , and so many Works of Effica\ncy are wrought by Natural Magick : They\ntell you, such was the Pjtbonissa, that raised\nthe Apparition to Sod, which appear d in\na Body of Wind and Air. Thus, if a Per\nson, by Natural Magick, should cast out Da-\nrnons ; it does not follow, that this was also\nfrom Divine Magick : And if Damons are\ncast out by Natural Magick, by one that is\nin the Fear of God, it does not follow, that\nhe is a true Magician of God ; but if it exor-\nbitates to Damoniacaly then it is condemn'd.\nAnd when Natural Magick keeps within its\nBounds, the Divines tell us, it is not con\ndemn'd in the Venerable Book which is the\nChristians sure Guide. But in as much as the\nLawfulness even of Natural Magick has been\ncall d in Question by others, I shall, in an Ap-\npendix jpih'd to this Treatise , examine that\nMatter, both according to the Reasons of our\nEnglish Laws, and according to the best stated\nRules of Casuistry that I am Master of ;\nstill submitting my judgment to the superior\njudgment of those who are profefs'd Divines\nand Lawyers : And if my opinions prove\nerroneous, I am willing to retract them. And\ntherefore, in this Place, there remains nothing\nfarther for me to do, but only, as Ihave\nshewn, on the one hand, how natural Ma\ngick, and its powerful Operations, are prov d\nby Reason ; to shew, on the other hand, how\n\u2022 :-^ '\u2022 \u25a0*\nis\n'\nfar\n\fof Mr. Duncan Camp bel u *8i-\nfar Reason in these Cases, is likewise back'd\nand supported by well-evidenc d Practice,and\nnotorious Experience. And to do this, after\nhaving mentioned one memorable Instance,\nwhich I refer the Reader to in the Body of\nthe Book, concerning the Performances of\nMr. Greatrix, to which the Lord Orrery was\na Witness in Ireland ; I shall, to avoid Pro^\nlixity, bring the other Testimonials of Pra-*\nctice, from the Success which our Duncan\nCampbell himself has had in this Way on\nother Occasions. \u2022 \u2022\n, ,:, ...\nIn the Year 1 7 1\n3 , lived in Fenchurch-Jlreet,\noneMr.Coates, a Tobacco Merchant,whohad\nbeen for many Years sorely tormented in his\nBody, and had had Recourse for a Cure to all\nthe most eminent Physicians of the Age, even\nup to the great Dr. Ratcliff himself ; but all\nthis mighty Application for Relief was still in\nvain : Each Doctor own'd him a Wonder\nand a Mystery to Physick, and left him as\nmuch a Wonder as they found him. Nei\nther could the Professors of Surgery guess at\nhis Ailment, or resolve the Riddle of his Di\nstemper ; and after having spent, from\nfirst to last, above a Thousand Pounds in\nsearch of proper Remedies, they found the\nSearch ineffectual : The Learned all agreed,\nthat it could proceed from nothing else but\nWitchcraft ; they had now indeed guessd\nthe Source of his Illness, but it was an Ill\nness of such a Kind, that, when they had\nti.hi r , \u201e\u25a0 . \/, h \u25a0. .\u25a0\u25a0 ; \u25a0> ,. 'found\n\fi8i 77* Life and Adventures\nfound it out, they thought themselves not\nthe proper Persons to prescribe to him any\nRemedies. That Task was reserv'd, it seems,\nfor our Duncan Campbell, who, upon some\nBody's Information or other, was sent\nfor to the bewitched Patient Mr. Coates,\nwho found him the Wonder that the others\nhad left him, but did Wonders in undertaking\nand compassing his Cure. I remember, one\nof the Ingredients made use of, was boiling\nhis own Water, but I can't tell how twas\nused ; and, upon turning over the Books of\nsome great Physicians since, I have found,\nthat they themselves have formerly deliver'd\nthar, as one part of the Prescriptions for the\nCure of Patients in like Cases. But as there\nare other Things, which Mr. Campbell per\nforms, that seem to require a Mixture of the\nSecond-sight, and of this Natural Magick be\nfore they can be brought about, I will enter\ntain the Reader with one or two Paslages of\nthat sort likewise, and so conclude the Histo\nry of this so singular a Man's Life and Ad\nventures.\nIn the Year 1710, a Geritlewoman lost:\nabout Six Pounds Worth of Flanders-Lace,\nand inasmuch as it was a Present made\nto her Husband, me was concerned as much\nas if it had been of twenty Times the Va\nlue ; and a Lady of her Acquaintance com\ning to visit her, to whom ihe unfolded a-\nmong other Things in Discourse this little\nDisaster : The Lady smiling, reply'd, with this\ni . Question,\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 18$\nQuestion, Did you never hear, Madam, of Mr.\nDuncan Campbell \\ It is but making your Ap\nplication to him, Things that are lost are im\nmediately found ; the Power of his Know\nledge exceeds even the Power of Laws ; they\nbut restrain, and frighten, and punifli Robbers,\nbut he makes Thieves expiate their Guilt, by\nthe more virtuous Way of turning Restorers\nof the Goods they have stol'n. Madam| re\njoined the losing Gentlewoman, you smile\nwhen you tell me this ; but really as much\na Trifle as it\nis,\nsince 'twas\na\nPresent to my\nHusband,\nI\ncan't help being sensibly concern\ned at\nit\n;\na\nMoment's Disappointment to him\nin\nthe least thing in Nature, creates\nin\nme\na\ngreater uneasiness, than the greatest Dis\nappointment to my single self could do, in\nThings of Moment and Importance. What\nmakes me (mile, laid the Lady when\nIspeak\nof\nit,\nor think of\nit,\nis\nthe Oddness and Pe\nculiarity of this Man\ns\nTalent\nin\nhelping one\nto such Things\n;\nbut, without the least Jest,\nI\naslure you, that\nI\nknow, by Experience, these\nThings come within the Compass of his Know\nledge\n;\nand\nI\nmust seriously tell you, for your\nfarther Satisfaction, that he has help'd me,\nand several of my Friends, to the finding a-\ngain Things lost, which were of great Value.\nAnd\nis\nthis, without laughing, true, said the\nlosing Fair, very gravely and demurely, like\na\nPerson half believing, and desirous to be fully\nconfirmed\nin\nsuch\na\nBelief\n?\nThe Lady she\nadvis'd\n\f,t$4 The LIFE and Adventures\n\u2022 advrs'd with,' slid then ascertain her of the\n-Truth of the Matter, alledging that, for a\nsingle half Guinea, he would inform her of\nher Things, and describe the Person that con\nvey'd them away. No sooner was this Gentle-\n\"Woman convinc d, but she was eager for the\nTryal, solicited her Friend to conduct her to\nMr. Campbell ; and upon the first Word of\nConsent, she was hooded and scarfed imme\ndiately, and they coached it away in a Trice\nto Mr. Campbell's House, whom they luckily\nfound within.\nThe Ladies had not been long seated, be\nfore he wrote down the Name ofthis new Cli\nent ofhis, exactly as it was, viz. Mrs. Saxon.\nThen she was in good Hopes, and with much\nConfidence propounded to him the question\nabout the Lace. He paused but a very little\nwhile upon the Matter before he describ'd\nthe Person that took\nit,\nand satisfy\nld\nher, that\nin two or three Days she would be Mistress\nof her Lace again, and find\nit\nin some Book,\nor Corner of her Room. She presented him\na\nHalf-Guinea, and was very contentedly go\ning away\n;\nbut Mr. Campbell very kindly\nstopped her, and signify\n'd\nto her,that\nif\nshe had\nno more to offer to him, he had something\nof more Importance to reveal to her\n:\nShe\nsate full of expectation while he wrote this\nnew Matter\n;\nand the Paper he deliver'd to\nher contain'd the following Account. As\nfor the Loss of\na\nlittle Bit of Lace,\nit\nis\na\nmere\n\fo\/JW&v Duncan Campbell.\" i8j\nmere Trifle ; you have lost a great many\nHundreds of Pounds, which your Aunt (nam\ning her Name) left you, but you are bub\nbled out of that large Sum.1 For while you\nwas artfully required down Stairs about some?\npretended Business or other, one Mr. H-ttrni\nconvey d your Aunt's Will out of. the Desk,'\nand several other Things of Value. And wri-?\nting down the Names of all the Persons con-\ncern'd, which put Mrs. Saxon in a great\nConsternation ; he concluded this Paper,\nwith bidding her go home with a contented\nMind, she should find her face in a few Days,:\nand as she found that predictions prove true,\nshe should afterwards come and consult about\nthe rest.\nWhen- she came home (it seems) big at\nfirst with the Thoughts of what (he had been\ntold, he rifled and ranfack'd every Comer,\nbut no Lace was to be met with ; all the.\nnext Day she hunted in the like manner,,\nbut frightened the whole\" Time, as if the I\nthought the Devil was the only Person could\nbring\nit,\nbut all to no purpose; the third\nDay her Curiosity abated, the gave over the\n>\nHopes of\nit*\nand took the prediction as\na\nvain\ndelusion, and that, what she gave for\nit,\nwas\nonly more money thrown away after what\n:\nhad been left before. That very Day, as\nit\n.\ncommonly happens\nin\nsuch Cases, when the\nleast dream'd of\nit,\nflie lighted on\nit\nby Acci\ndent and Surprize. She ran with\nit\nin\nher\nHand\n\f186 The Life and Adventures\nHand immediately to her Husband, and now\nshe had recovered it again, told him of the\nLoss- of\nit,\nand the whole Story of her ha\nving been at Mr. Campbell's about\nit\n,\u2022\nand\nthen amplifying the Discourse about what he\nhad told her besides, as to more considera\nble Affairs, she said, she resolved to go and\nconsult him\na\nlittle farther about them, and\nbegg'd her Husband to accompany her. He\nwould fain have laugh'd her out of that Opi\nnion and Intent\n;\nbut the End was she per\nsuaded him into\nit,\nand prevailed upon him\nto seem at least very serious about the matter,\nand go with her to the Oracle, assuring him\nthere was no room for doubting the fame\nSuccess.\n- Well\n!\nto Mr. Campbell's they accordingly\ncame, and after Mr. Saxon, in Deference to\nhis Wife's Desire, had paid our Predictor\na\nhandsome Compliment of Gold\n;\nMr. Dun-\ncm Campbell saluted him\nin\nas grateful\na\nmanner, with the assurance, that there was\nin Kent\na\nlittle Country-House with some\nLands appertaining to\nit,\nthat was his,\nin\nright\nof his Wife\n:\nThat he had the House, as\nit\nwere, before his Eyes, that tho' he had ne\nver actually seen\nit,\nnor been near the\nplace where\nit\nstood, he had seen\nit\nfigura\ntively as\nif\nin exact Painting and Sculpture,\nthat particularly\nit\nhad four green Trees be\nfore the Door\n;\nfrom whence he was positive,\nthat\nif\nMr. Saxon went with him\nin\nquest\nof\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell! z$?\nof\nit,\nhe should find\nit\nout, and know.it as\nwell, the Moment he came near\nit,\nas\nif\nhe\nhad been an Inhabitant\nin\nit\nall his Life.\n\u2022 tyiti'Saxon, tho' somewhat of an Unbe\nliever, yet must naturally wish to find\nit\ntrue,\nyou.may.be sure\n;\nand yet partly doubting the\nevent and partly pleased with the visionary\nPromise of\na\nFortune he never expected,\nlaughed very heartily at the Odd ness of the\nAdventure, and said, he wouldrconsider, whe\nther\nit\nwould not savour, too much of Quix\notism, to be at the Expence of\na\njourney on\nsuch Frolicks, and on such\na\nchimerical Foun\ndation of airy Hopes, and that then he would\ncall; again and let Mr. Campbell know his\nmind' upon that Point. ... \u2022;>'-:;\n>'\nv.-Jri every Company he cameir^p,:\nit\nserv'd\nfor laughter and Diversion\n;\nthey all, how-\nLover,\nagreed twas worth his while, since the\njourney would not be very expensive^ to go\nit\nby way of Frolick, His Wife one morning\nlaying, that she did remember some.Talk of\na\nHouse, and such Things as Mr. Campbell had\ndeserib'dj put him forward upon the Adven\nture\n;\nand upon Mr. Saxon's proposing\nit\nto\nhis brother Bernard, Mr. Barnard sovourd\nthe Proposal as\na\nJoke, and agreed upon the\nCountry Ramble. They came on horseback\nto Mr.Campbell's, with\na\nthird Horse,pn which\nthe Dumb Predictor was mounted, and so on\nthey jogg'd into Kent towards Sevenoak, be\ning the Place which he describ'd.The first Day\nthey setout was on\na\nSaturday Morning \\x\\Jimey\nand\n\fi88 TjfoLiFE and Adventures\nand about Five that Afternoon they arrived\nat the Black-Bull at Sevenoak in Kent. It\nbeing a delicate Evening, they took an agree\nable Walk up a fine Hill gracefully adorn'd\nwith Woods, to Knolle, an ancient Seat of\nthe Earl of Dorset s, meeting, by the way,\nwith an old Servant of the Earl's, one Perkin,\nhe offered Mr. Barnard, who\n(it\nseems) was\nhis old Acquaintance, to give them all\na\nSight\nof that fine ancient Seat.\nAfter they had pleased themselves with\nviewing the antique Nobility'of that infra\nstructure, this ferkin went back with them\nto their Inn, the Butt at Sevenoak. They\nthat could talk were very merry in Chat; and\nthe Dumb Gentleman^\nwho saw them laugh,\nand wear all the signs of alacrity in their\nCountenances, was resotv'd not to be behind\nwith their Tongues, and\nby\nDint of Pen, Ink,\nand Paper, that he made Signs should be\nbrought in, was resolv'd (if one might be said\nto crack without Noise) to crack his jest as\nwell as the best of them\n;\nfor\nit\nmay be tru\nly\nsaid of him, that he seldom comes into\nany even diverting company, where he,\nis\nnot the most diverting Man there,and the Head\n(tho' we cant call him 'the Mouth) of the\nchearful Society. After having eyd this Per\nkins\na\nlittle, and being grown t his Art*\nas we may suppose, as familiar with the Man's\nHumour, as\nif\nhe had known him as many\nYears as Mr. Barnard\n:\nPray, Mr. Barnard\nCqudth\nm\n\fof Mr. Duncan <3ampb ei\/i? 189\nquoth he, in writing) how comes\nit,\nyou,\nthat are\" so stanch and\nso\nrigid\na\nWhig, should\nbe\nso\nacquainted and so particularly familiar\nwith' such ah old Papist, and-\nso\nviolent\na\nJa\ncobite, as\nI\nknow that Mr. Perkin fwhom\nI\nnever, saw, nor had any Notice of\nin\nmy\nLife) to be\n?\nAnd pray, reply\n'd\nMr. Bar\nnard, rwhat Reason have you, beyond\na\nPun,\nto take him for\na\nJacobite\n?\nMust he be so,\nbecause his name\nis\nPerkin?\nI\ndo \u2022\nassure\nyou, in' this you shew your self but little\nof\na\nconjurer\n:\nIf you can tell no more of\nHouses than you do of Men\n,\nwe may give\nover our Search after the House you spoke\nof\n:\n(Here the reader must understand, they\ndiscoursed on their Fingers, and wrote by\nr\nTurns.) Mr. Campbell reply\n'd\nseriously, Lay\ning\na\nwager\nis\nno Argument in other Things,\nI\nown\n;\nbut in this\nI\nknow\nit\nis\n;\nbecause\nI\nam sure, after we have laid the Wager, he\nwill fairly confess\nit\namong Friends, since\nit?\nwill go no farther\n:\nAnd\nI,\nsaid Mr. Campbells\nwill lay what Wager you will apiece with you\nall round. Hereupon, Mr. Barnard,- who had\nknown him\na\ngreat many Years, was the first\nthat laid\n;\nand many more, to the Number\nof Five or Six, follow'd his example. The\nDecision of the Matter was deferr'd till next\nDay, at the Return of the old man to the\nInn\n;\nthey being about to break up that Night,\nand go to Bed. .\nU\n:\nThe\n\f3.90 The Life and Adventures*\nThe next Day, being Sunday, the land-:\nlord carry d his Guests to fee the Country j\nand after a handsome Walk, they came thro*\nthe Churchyard. They were poring upon\nthe Tombs ; no Delight can be . greater to\nMr. Campbell than that : And really,by the fre\nquent Walks he usually takes in Westminster-\nAbbey, and the Churchyards adjacent to this\nMetropolis , one would imagine he takes De\nlight to italk along by himself on that dumb\nsilent Ground, where the characters of the\nPersons are only to be known, as his own\nMeaning is, by Writings and Inscriptions on\nthe Marble. When they had sufficiently\nsurvey d the Churchyard , it grew near Din\nner-time, and they went homewards ; but\nbefore they had got many Yards out of the\nChurchyard, Mr. Campbell makes a full Stop,\npointing up to a House ; and stopping his\nFriends a little, he pulls out of his Pocket a\nPencil and Paper, and writes down the fol\nlowing Words : That, That is the House my\nVision presented to me ; Icouldswear it to be\nthe same : I know it to be the same : Iam\ncertain os it. The Gentlemen with him re-\nmark'd it ; would not take any farther No-'*\ntice at that Time, intending to enquire into\nit with Secrecy ; and so went on to the Inn\nto Dinner.\nAs merry as they had been the Night be\nfore after Supper, they were still more inno\ncently chearful this Day after Dinner, till the\nTime\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell. 291\nTime of Service began. When the duty of\nthe Day was performed and over, they re\nturns to divert and unbend their Minds,\nwith pleasant but harmless Conversation. I\nsuppose no body, but a Set of very great\nFormahfts, will be offended with Scandal or\nScruples, that, to Travellers just ready to de\npart the Town , Mr. Perkin came on that\ngood Day, and decided the Wagers, by own\ning to all the Company (Secrecy being first\nenjoined) that he was a Roman Catbolick ;\ntho' no body of the Family knew it in so\nmany Years as he had liv'd there, which \"was\nbefore Mr. Campbell was born. This, and\nother innocent Speeches, afforded as much\nChearfulneft as the Lords-Day would al\nlow of. ..:.\nOn the next Day, being Monday', they sent\nfor one Mr. Toland Toler, an Attorney of the\nPlace, to find out to whom that House be-\nlong'd ; but by all the Enquiry that could pos\nsibly be made, Cwith convenient Secrecy J no\nbody could find it out for a long Time ; but\nat last it came to light, and appeard to be just\nly to a Tittle as Mr. Campbell had predicted.\nBeing now latisfy'd, the next Day our three\nTravellers return'd for London ; and the two\nVocal Men were very jocular upon their Ad\nventure, and by their outward Gesticulations,\ngave the prophetical Mute his Share of Di\nversion. Mr. Barnard as they pafe'd into a\nFarm-House Yard, remark'd, that all the Hogs\nU 2 fell\n;\n\f19* fbe Life and ADVEritUR. E9\nsell ^grunting and squeaking more and more,\nas Mr. Campbell came nearer ; (who, poor\nman? could know nothing of\" the Jest, nor\nthe Cause of\nit,\ntill they alighted, and- told\nit\nhim by Signs and Writing\n;\n)\nand said to Mr.\nSaxon, laughing, Now we have found out our\nHouse, we ihall have only Mr. Campbell home\nagain by himself; \\Ve have no farther need\nof the Devil, that ac'company'd him to the\nCountry, up to town with us-; there are o-\nther Devils enow to be met with there, he\nknows\n;\nand\nso\nthis, according to the Fashi\non of his Predecessor Devils,\nis\nenter\n'd\ninto the\nHerd of Swine.\n. However, the Event of this journey'\ns\nto\ncut the Story ihort\n)'-\nprocur'd Mr. Saxon\na\ngreat insight (upon Enquiry) into several Af\nfairs belonging to\/him, of which he would\notherwise have had no Knowledge7; and he\nis\nnow engaged\nin\n&Chancerj>-Smt to do him\nself justice, and\nin,\na\nfair way\nof\nrecovering\ngreat Sums of Money\n;\nwhich, without the\nConsultation he had with this Dumb Gen-\ntlenianV'-he had\nin\nall Likelihood never\n'dreamt -of.\n:\n->\u25a0\nS\" 1st the year 1711,\na\nGentleman, whose\nNairn\u00a9 lhall be, in this Place, Amandas\n;\nfam'd\nsarliis exqaisiteTalentsin all Arts and Sciences,\nbut particularly for his Gentleman-like and\nentertaining Manner of Conversation\n;\nwhose\nCompany was affected\nby\nall Men of Wit,\nwho grew his friends, and courted\nby\nall\ni\njj -\n\u2022\nLadies\n\f: qfiMr. DuncanCa-MPBEW- ip?\nLadies of an elegant Taste,, who grew his\nAdmirers :, This accomplisli'd Gentleman, I\nfay, came to Mr. Campbell, in order to pro1\npound a question to him ; which was To ve1\nry intricate, and\nso-\ndifficult to answer, that\nif\nhe did answer\nit,\nit\nmight administer to\nhimself, and the Ladies he brought\n,\nwith\nhim, the Pleasure of admiration, of seeing\na\nTiling\nso\nwonderful\nin\nit\nself persorm'd\n;\nOr, on the other, hand, if. he did not make\na\nsatisfactory reply to\nit,\nthen\nit\nmight 'af\nford him and the Ladies\na\nvery great De\nlight,\nin\nbeing the first that puzzled\na\nman\nwho had had the reputation for Ger many\nYearSj of being capable of baffling all the\nwittiest Devices and shrewd Stratagems that\nhad been, from Time to Time, invented to\nbaffle his -Skills and explode his Penetration\nin the Second-Sight, and\" the Arts which he\npretended to.\n,\nThe Persons, whom Amandm\nbrought with him, were the illustrious La\ndy Delphinai distinguifh'd for her great Qua;\nlity, but still more celebrated for her beauty\n;\nhis own Lady, the admir'd Amabella, and\na\nyoung, blooming, pretty, Virgin, whom we\nwill call by the Name\nof\nAdeodata\n;.\nabout\nwhich last Lady, the question was to be put\nto Mr. Campbell. Adeodata,\nit\nseems, was the\n\u2022\nnatural daughter of this very-fine. Gentleman,\nwho had never let her into the Knowledge,\nof her own birth, but had bred her up from\n}her Infancy.under.\na\nborrow'd Name,\nin\nthe\n.:.'i\nj\nU\n3\nNotion\n\/- \u2022-\n\f194 Tbe Life and Adyentur.es\nNotion that she was a Relation's Daughter,\nand recommended to his Care in her Infan\ncy. Now the Man that had the Second-\nSight was to be try'd : It was now to be\nput to the Proof, if he could tell Names, or\nno. Amandus was so much an Unbeliever,\nas to be willing to hazard the Discovery*\nAmabella and Delphina were Strangers to\nher real Name ; and ask'd Duncan Camp\nbell ; not doubting, but he would set down\nthat which she ordinarily went by. Ama\nbella had indeed been told by Amandus, that\nAdeodata was the natural Daughter of a near\nFriend of his ; but who this near Friend\nwas, remain'd a Secret : That was the Point\nwhich lay upon our Duncan Campbell to disco\nver. When the Question was proposed to\nhim, what her Name was j he looked at her\nvery stedfastly, and shook his head ; and after\nsome Time, he wrote down, that it would\nbe a very difficult Name for him to fix up\non. And truly so it proved : He toil d for\nevery Letter till he sweated ; and the La\ndies laugh'd incontinently, imagining that\nhe was in an Agony of Shame and Confu\nsion, at finding himself pos'd. He desired\nAmandus to withdraw a little, for that he\ncould not so well take a full and proper Sur\nvey of Ladies Faces, when a gentleman was\nby. This Disturbance and Perplexity of his,\nafforded them still more subject of Mirth ;\nand that Excuse was taken as a Pretence, and\na Put\n\fof Mr. Duncan Camp'b ell zpj\na Put-off^ to cover his shame the better, and\nhide from one at least, that he was but a\ndownright Bungler, in what he pretended\nto be so wonderful an Artist. However,\nafter two Hours hard Sweat and Labour, and ,\nviewing the Face in different Shades and\nLights, (for I must observe to the Reader,\nthat there is a vast deal of Difference ; some\nhe can tell in a minute or two, with Ease ;\nsome not in less than four or five hours, and\nthat with great Trouble ;) he undeceived\nthem with Regard to his Capacity. He wrote\ndown, that Adeodatds real Name was Aman\nda, as being the natural Daughter of Aman-\ndus. Delphina and Arabella were surpriz'd\nat the Discovery ; and Amandus , when he\nwas call'd in, owning it a Truth, his Wife\nAmabella applauded the curious Way of her\ncoming by such a discovery, when Adeodata\nwas just marriageable ; took a Liking to her,\nas if her own Daughter ; and every Thing\nended with Profit, Mirth and Chearfulness. I\ncould add a Thousand more Adventures of\nMr. Campbell's Life, but that would prove te\ndious ; and as the Town has made a great De\nmand for the Book, it was thought more pro\nper to conclude it here. The most diverting\nof all are to be found, best to the Life, in\nOriginal Letters that pass'd between Mr. Camp\nbell and his Correspondents ; some select ones\nof which will be shortly publifh'd, with a\nContinuation of his Life to the present Time,\nU 4 for\n%\n^\n\fry6 The Life and Adven t ti re s, &c.\nfor the farther Entertainment of such Read\ners as \/hall relish this Treatise : In which,\nthe Author hopes he shall be esteemed to have\nendeavour'd at the Intermingling of some\ncurious Disquisitions of Learning, with enter\ntaining Pastages ; and to have ended all the\nmerriest Adventures with a sober, instructive,\nand edifying Moral ; which, to those who are\nnot willing to believe the stories,' is reckond\nsufficient to recommend even Fables them\nselves.

Egyptians') Sorcerers\nPretenders to Prophesy, &c. with some\nproper Remarks, suited to our present Pur\npose) as well to satisfy them who are fan\ntastically Wife, and obstinately shut their\nEyes against the most refulgent Reason, and\nare wilfully deaf to the most convincing\nand persuasive Arguments, and thereupon\ncry out, that Mr. Campbell\nis\neither an Im\npostor and\na\nCheat, or at least\na\nPerson\nwho acts by the Assistance of unlawful\nPowers\n;\nas also to put to silence the no\nless waspish Curs, who are always snarling\nat such, whom Providence has distinguish\n'd\nby more excellent Talents than their Neigh\nbours. True Merit\nis\nalways the Mark,\nagainst which Traducers level their keenest\nDarts\n;\nand Wit and Invention oftentimes\njoin Hands with Ignorance and Malice to\nfoil those who excel. Art has no greater\nEnemy than Ignorance\n;\nand were there no\nsuch Thing as Vice, Virtue would not shine\nwith half its Lustre. Did Mr. Campbell\nperform those wonderful things he\nis\nso\ndeservedly famous for, as these Cavillers\nfay,\nby\nholding Intelligence with Infernal\nPowers, or\nby\nany unjustifiable Means,\nI\nam\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell 199\nam of Opinion, he would find very few, in\nthis Atheistical Age, who would open their\nMouths against him, since none love to act\ncounter to the interest of that Master they\nindustriously serve. And did he, on the other\nHand, put the Cheat upon the World, as they\nmaliciously assert, I fancy he would then be\nmore generally admired, especially in a Coun\ntry where the Game is so universally, art\nfully, and no less profitably play'd, and that\nwith Applause, since those Pretenders to\nWisdom merrily divide the whole Species of\nMankind into the two Classes of Knaves and\nFools, fixing the Appellation of Folly only\nupon those whom they think not Wise, that\nis,\nwicked enough to have\na\nShare with\nthem in the profitable Guilt.\nOur laws are as well intended by their\nwise makers to skreen the Innocent, as to\npunish the Guilty\n;\nand where their Penal\nties are remarkably severe, the Guilt they\npunish\nis\nof\na\nproportionable Size. Art,\nwhich\nis\na\nMan's Property when acquire!,\nclaims\na\nProtection from those very Laws\nwhich false Pretenders thereto are to be try'd\nand punished by, or else all Science would\nsoon have an end\n;\nfor no Man would dare\nmake use of any Talent Providence had\nlent him, and his own industrious Applica\ntion had improved, should he be immedi\nately try'd and condemn\n'd\n(by those Statues,\nwhich\n\f(}oo The Life and Adventures\nwhich are made to suppress Villains,) by eve\nry conceited and half learned Pedant.\n'Tis true indeed, those excellent Statutes,\nwhich are made against 4 sort of People,\nwho pretend to Fortune-telling, and the like,\nare such as are well warranted, as being\nbuilt upon the best foundation, viz. Relir\ngion and Policy j ami. were Ms. Campbell\nguilty of any such Practice4 as those are\nmade to punish, I openly declare, that. I\n\"should be so far from endeavouring to de\nfend his cause, that I would be one of the\n(first that ihoujd aggravate his Crime, there-\nby. to enforce the speedier Execution of\n-those Laws upon him which are made against\njsuch Offenders^ But when he is so far from\nadding, that he doth not even pretend to any\niuch Practice, or for countenancing the fame\nin others, as is manifest from the many De\njections he has made of that fort of Villany*\n-which the Book furnishes us with, I think\nmy self sufficiently justified for thus pleading\nin his Defence.\nI cannot but take notice, in reading the\nstatutes made . against such offenders, our\nwise Legislature hath not in any part of\nthem seem'd so much as to imply, that\nthere are in reality any such wicked Persons\nas they arc made against, to wit, Conjurers,\n&c. but that -they are only Pretenders, to\nthose infernal arts as may reasonably slap\ninferr'd\n\fof Mr. Duncan Cam pbell y$i\ninferr'd from the Nature of the Penalties\nthey inflict ; for our first Laws of that sort\nonly inflicted a penalty, which affected the\nGoods and Liberty of the guilty, and not\ntheir Lives, tho' indeed they were afterwards\nforced to heighten the Punishment with a\nhalter ; not that they were- better convinc'd,\nas I humbly conceive, but because the Crimi\nnals were most commonly Persons who had\nno goods to forfeit; and to whom their Li\nberty was no otherwise valuable, but as it gave\nthem the opportunity of doing Mischief. In\ndeed our Law-Books do furnish us with ma\nny Instances of Persons, who have been tryd\nand executed for Witchcraft and Sorcery, but\nthen the wiser part of Mankind have taken the\nLiberty to condemn the Magistrate, at that\ntime of day, of too much Inconsideratibn,\nand the Juries of an equal (hare of Credulity :\nAnd those who have suffered for such Crimes\nhave been commonly Persons of the lowest\nrank, whose Poverty might occasion a Dill\nlike of them in their FelloW-Creatures, and\ntheir too artless Defence, subject them to\ntheir mistaken Justice ; so that upon the\nwhole, I take the Liberty to conclude* and,\nI hope, not without good grounds, that\nthose Laws were made to deter Men from\nan idle Pretence to mysterious and unjusti\nfiable Arts, which, if too closely pursued,\ncommonly lead them into the darkest Villa-\nny, not only that of deceiving others, but\n, \u25a0- i as\n\fjoi The Life and Adventures\nas far as in them be, making themselves\nSlaves to the Devil ? And not to prevent\nand hinder Men from useful Enquiries, and\nfrom the practice of such Arts, which tho'\nthey are in themselves mysterious, yet are,\nand may be lawful.\nI would not however be thought, in con\ntradiction to my former Arguments, to as\nsert, that there never were, or that there\nnow are no Persons, such as Wizards, Sor\ncerers, &c. for by so doing, I should be as\nliable to be censored for my Incredulity, as\nthose who defame Mr. Campbell on that Ac\ncount, are for their want of Reason and com\nmon honesty. Holy and Prophane Writ, I\nconfess, furnishes us with many instances of\nsuch Persons ; but we must not from thence\nhastily infer, that all those Men are such who\nare spightfully branded with the odious Guilt ;\nfor were it in the Devil's Power to make\nevery wicked Man a Wizard , and Woman a\nWitch, he soon would have Agents enough\nto shake this lower World to Atoms ; but\nthe Almighty, who restrains him, likewise\nrestrains those.\nHaving premised thus much, I shall now\nproceed to consider some of the Acts of Par\nliament themselves ; the Persons against whom\nthey were made, and the Necessity of making\nthe fame. And some of the first Acts we\nmeet with, were those which were made\nagainst a sort of People called Gypsies,\nPersons,\n\fos Mr. Duncan Campbell 3-03\nPersons, who, if in reality such, might, if\nany, be suspected of practising what we call\nthe Black Art, the same having been for\nmany Ages encouraged in their Country ;\nnay, so much has it been by them favour'd,\nthat it was introduced into their superstiti\nous Religion\n(if\nI\nmay without an Absur\ndity call it\nso) and made an essential Part\nthereof\n:\nAnd,\nI\nbelieve, Mahomet anism has\nnot much mended the Matter, since\nit\nhas\nimperiously reigned there, or\nin\nany respect\nreform'd that Idolatrous Nation. Now the\nMischief these Persons might do (being\nso\nmuch\nin\nthe Devil's Power) among the un\nwary, was thought too considerable not to\nbe provided against\nj\nand therefore our wise\nLegislature, the more effectually to prevent\nthe same, by striking at the very Founda\ntion, made an Act in the n X VIII.\nThat\nif\nany, calling themselves Gypsies,\ndo come into this Realm, they shall forfeit\nall their Goods\n;\nand being demanded, shall\ndepart the Realm within fifteen Days, upon\npain of Imprisonment\n;\nand the Importers of\nthem by another Act, were made liable to\na\nheavy Penalty. This Act was continu'd by\nthe\n1\nPh. and Ma. Conjuration, Witchcraft,\nJnchantment, and sorcery, to get Money, or\nconsume any Person in his Body, Members,\nor Goods, or to provoke any Person to un\nlawful Love, was by the 33 X VIII. 14. and\nthe\n5\nEliz. 16. and the\nI\nJac.\nI.\nii. made\nFelony\n;\n\f504 The Life and Adventures\nfelony ; and by the fame 33 H. VIII. 14. it\nwas made Felony to declare to another any\nfalse Prophecies upon Arms, &c. but this\nAct was repealed by the 1 Ed. VI. iz. but\nby another Act of the 3 and 4 of Ed. VI.\n1 j. it was again enacted, that all such Per\nsons who should pretend to prophecies, &c.\nshould, upon conviction for the first Offence\nforfeit Ten Pounds, and one Year's Impri\nsonment ; and for the second Offence, all his\nGoods and Imprisonment for Life. And by\nthe 7. Ed. VI. 11. the same was made to\ncontinue but till the then next Session of\nParliament. And by the 5% Eliz. 15-. the\nfame Act was again renewed against fanta\nstical Prophefiers, &c. but both those Acts\nwere repealed by the 1\nJac. I. 1 z.\nThus far we find, that for Reasons of State,\nand for the Punishment of particular Persons,\nthose Acts w ere made and repealed, as oc\ncasion required, and not kept on foot, or in\ndeed were they ever made use\nof,\nas\nI\ncan\nremember in my reading, against any Per\nsons whose Studies led them into\na\nuseful\nEnquiry into the Nature of Things, or a\nlawful Search into the Workings of Na\nture\nit\nself, by which means many things\nare foretold long before they come to pals,'\nas Eclypses, and the like,' which Astrologers\nsuccessfully do, st art has been\nin\nall A-'\nges held in\nso\ngreat Esteem, that the first Mo.\nnarchs of the East made-\nit\ntheir peculiar-\nStudy,\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell.\" %0$\nStudy, by which means they deservedly ac\nquired to themselves the Name of Magi or\nWife Men ; but, on the contrary, were pro\nvided against Persons profligate and loose,\nwho, under a Pretence and Mask of Science,\ncommit vile and roguish Cheats ; and this\nwill the more plainly appear, if we consider\nthe Letter and express Meaning of the follow\ning acts, wherein the Persons Iam speaking of\nare described by such characters which suf\nficiently prove the Assertion : For in the 39\nof Eliz. 4. it was enacted, That all Persons\ncalling themselves scholars going about beg-\nging,Sea-faring Men pretending Loslesof their\nShips and Goods at Sea, and going about the\nCountry begging, or using any subtile Craft,\nfeigning themselves to have Knowledge in Phi-\nJiognomy, Palmistry, or any other the like\ncrafty Science, or pretending that they can tell\nDestinies, Fortunes, or such like fantastical\nImaginations, shall be taken and deem'd\nRogues, Vagabonds, sturdy Beggars, and shall\nbe stripped naked from the Middle upwards,\nand whipp'd till his,or herBody be bloody.And\nby the 1\nJam. r. 12. for the better restraining\nof the said Offences, and for the farther pu\nnishing the same, it was farther enacted, That\nany Person or Persons using witchcraft, Sor*\neery, &c. and all their Aiders, Abettors, and\nCounsellors, being convicted and attainted\nof the fame Offences, shall suffer Pain of\nDeatli as Felons, without the Benefit of Cler-\nX gy;\n\f306 The Life and Adventur es\ngy : Or to tell and declare in what Place any\nTreasure of Gold and Silver should or might\nbe found in the Earth, or other secret Places :\nOr where Goods or Things lost or stolen\nshould be found : Or to provoke any Person\nto unlawful Love, such Offender to suffer\nImprisonment for one whole Year without\nBail or Mainprize, and once in every quarter\nof the said Year mall in some Market-Town,\nor upon the Market-Day, or at any such Time\nas any Fair shall be kept there, stand openly\nin the Pillory for the $space of six hours, and\nthere shall openly confess his or their Offence;\nand for the second Offence shall suffer Death\nas Felons without the Benefit of Clergy.\nThat these Laws were made against a Set\nof Villains, whose natural Antipathy to Ho\nnesty and Labour, furnished them with Pre\ntensions to an uncommon Skill, thereby the\nmore easily to gull and cheat the superstiti^\nin credulous, and by that means discover\nfrom them some such Secrets that might far\nther them in perpetrating the more consum\nmate Villany, is plain from the very Words\nand Expressions of the very A&s themselves,\nand the Description of the Persons they are\nmade against ; and not, as I before observed,\nto prevent and hinder Men from the lawful\nEnquiry after useful, delightful, and profitable\nknowledge.\nMr. Campbell, who has been long a settled\nand reputable Inhabitant in many eminent\n*\nParts\n\fofMr. Duncan Campbell 307\nParts of the City of London, cannot, I am\nsure, be lobk'd upon as one of those these\nActs of Parliament were made against, un\nless we first strip the acts themselves of their\nown natural, express and plain Meaning, and\ncloath them with that which is more obscure,\nunnatural, forced, and constrained ; a practice,\nwhich, if allowed, would make them wound\nthe Innocent and clear the Guilty, and ren\nder them not our Defence but our greatest\nEvil ; they would, by that means, become\na perfect JLnigma, (or Riddle) and be so far\nfrom being admired for their Plainnese, that\nthey would be even exploded like the Oracles\nof the heathens for their double Meaning.\nIf Mr. Campbell has the Second-Sight, as is\nunquestionable from the allowed Maxim, that\nwhat has been may be again, and by that\nmeans can take a View of Contingencies, and\nfuture Events ; so long as he confines these\nNotices of approaching Occurrences to a good\npurpose, and makes use of them only inno\ncently and charitably to warn Persons from do\ning such Things, that according to his Con\nceptions would lead them into Misfortune,\nor else in ,\nputting them upon such Arts that\nmay be of Use and Benefit to themselves and\nposterity, always having a strict Regard to\nMorality and religion to which he truly ad\nheres : Certainly, I think, he ought so much\nthe more to be admired for the fame, by how\nmuch the more this his excellent knowledge\n: X % is\n\f^o8\nThe Life and Adventures\nis surpassing that of other Men, and not be\ntherefore unjustly upbraided with the injuri\nous character of a Cheat, or an ill Man :\nHowever, this Iwill presume to affirm, and I\ndoubt not but to have my Opinion confirm'd\nby the Learned Sages of the Law, that this\ninnocent practice, and I venture to add, ho\nnest one too, doth by no means entitle him\nto the Penalties of the before-mentioned\nLaws made against Fortune-tellers, and such\nsort of profligate Wretches ; which it as great\nan absurdity to decry, as it would be to call\nhim, who is a settled, and reputable Inhabi\ntant, a Stroler or wandering Beggar.\nAgain, It is true that Mr. Campbell has re\nlieved many that have been supposed to have\nbeen bewitched, as is related and well attested\nin this Account of his Life ; but will any one\nfrom thence argue that he himself is a real\nConjurer or Wizard, because he breaks the\nChains by which those unhappy wretches were\nbound l No surely, for if that were the Case,\nwe might then as well indict the Physician\nwho drives away a malignant Distemper, and\nroots out its latentCause by his mysterious Skill\nin Plants and Drugs ; or conclude, that the\nJudge who condemns a Criminal is for the\nlame Reason guilty of the self-same Crime for\nwhich the Offender is so by him condemned.\nPersons who delight in such unnatural Con\nclusions, must certainly be in love with the\ngreatest absurdities, and must entirely aban\ndon\n\fos Mr. Duncan Campbell 509\ndon their natural Reason, before they can be\nbrought to conclude, that the Prince of Dark\nness would assist Men in destroying his own\nPower.\nThe best answer I can afford these Men is\nSilence ; for if they will not argue upon the\nPrinciples of Reason, or be guided by her\ndictates, I think them no more fit to be con\ntended with, in a rational and decent man\nner, than Bedlamites, and such who are bereft\nof all Understanding. A Rod is the best Ar\ngument for the Back of a Fool, and Contempt\nthe best Usage that ought to be shewn to every\nhead-strong and ignorant Opponent.\nIn a Word, Iknow of no Branch of Mr.\nCampbell's Practice that bears the least Resem\nblance to those Crimes mentioned in the fore\ngoing acts. That he can and doth tell Peoples\nNames at first Sight, tho' Perfect Strangers to\nhim, is confessed by all who have made the\ncurious Enquiry at his Hands ; but what part\nof the Law, Iwould fain know,is that against ?\nKnowledge, and a clear Sight into things not\ncommon, is not only an allowable, but a com\nmendable Qualification ; and whether this\nKnowledge in him be inherent, accidental, or\nthe result of a long study, the Case is still the:\nfame ; since we are assured he doth it by no-\nunlawful Intelligence,or makes use of the fame\nto any\nill\npurpose, and therefore\nis\nundoubted\nly\nas lawful as to draw natural Conclusions\nfrom right Premises.. Hard\nis\nthe Fate of any\nX\n3\nMaq\n\f$io The Life and Adventures,\nMan to be ignorant, but much harder would\nhis Lot be, it he were to be punished for being\nWife, and, like Mr. Campbell, excelling others\nin this kind of Knowledge.\nMuch more might be said in Defence of\nMr. Campbell and the Art he profesleth, but as\nthe Arguments which are brought against\nhim by his Enemies on the one Hand, are\ntrivial and ill-grounded ; I therefore think\nthey deserve no farther Refutation ; so on the\nother, his Innocency is too clear to require it.\nAfter having thus taken a Survey of Mr.\nCampbell's practices, with regard to their Le\ngality according to the Statutes and the Laws\nof the Nation wherein he lives, we will con\nsider next, whether according to \u2022 the stated\nRules of Casuistry, among the great divines\neminent for their Authority, it may be lawful\nfor Mr. Campbell to predict, or for good\nChristian Persons to visit his House, and con\nsult him about his predictions. I have upon\nthis Head examined all the learnedest Casuists\nI could meet with in ancient times, for I\ncannot meet (in my reading with any Mo\nderns that treat thoroughly upon this cafe,\nor I should rather have chosen them, because\nperhaps the Second-Sight was lese known in\nthose antient Days thank has been since, and\nso might escape their Notice. :' \u25a0'\nMy Design is first to give the reader a\ndilinct Summary of all that has been said of\nthis Matter, and to do it as succinctly and\nt briefly\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell. 311-\nbriefly as possible, and then to argue my\nself from what they agree upon as to this\nMan's particular Case.\nThat every one may have recourse to the\nAuthors themselves, if they have a curiosity,\nand find that I don't go about to impose up\non their Judgments, I will here tell the Rea\nder where he may find the whole Contents\nof the following little Abstract of Divinity\nand Casuistry ; because it would be a tedious\npiece of Work to set down the Words of each\nof them distinctly, and quote them every\none round at the end of their several dif\nferent sentences, which tend to the lame.\nMeaning; but I will strictly keep to the Sense.\nof them all ; and I here give the Reader their.\nNames, and the Places, that he may consult\nthem himself, if his Inclination leads him to\nbe vi curious; Thomas Aquinas 4.

An express In\nvocation\nis\nby Word or Deed, by which\na\nreal\ncompact isactually made with the Devil, and\nthat\nis\na\nSin that affects the Death of the Soul,\naccording tathe Laws of Theology, and ought\nto effect the Death of the Body, according to\nCivil and Political Laws. The tacit Invoca\ntion of D\u00e6mons\nis\nthen only, when\na\nMan\nbusies himscff so far with such persons, that\nit\nis\nmeet, and just, that the Devil should be per\nmitted, to. have to do with him, though\nit\nwas\nopposite to the Intention of the Man.\n\u25a0\nBut then this express Invocation again\nis\nsubdivided .into several Species, according to\nthe divers manners\nby\nwhich the Devil in\nstructs these men.\n\u2022\n,\nj\n\u2022\n.\n\u2022\nThe first\nis\nEnebanttrtent, which\nI\nneed not\ndescribe, and of which\nI\nwill speak: ho more,\nbecause\nit\nis\nwhat every Body know^to be de-\nteslable,and no Body ought to kno^^tbje art,\nthereof:, .v\n,\nVJ\nr\n\\\n,\n\u25a0\nThe second\n\\k\nDivination by dreams when\n'\nany Instructions are expected from the Devil .\nby\nway of Dream, which\nis\na\ncapi$aLCrime.y\n:':,<:\nI\nThe\n\fos Mr. Duncan Campbell! jij\nThe third is called necromancy, which\nis,\nwhen by the use of Blood and writing, or\nspeaking certain Verses, the Dead seem to rise\nagain, and speak and teach future Things. For\ntho the Devil can't recal\na\nSoul departed, yet\nhe can (as some have thought) take the shape\nof the dead corpse, himself actuate\nit\nby\nhis\nSubtilty, as\nif\nit\nwas informed with\na\nSoul. And\nsome affirm, that by the Divine Permission,\nthe Devil can do this, and spake\nso\nin\nthe Case\nof, Samuel and Saul. But Divines of\na\nmore\nsolid Genius attribute that Power only to the\nDeity, and fly, with Reason, that\nit\nis\nbeyond\nthe Devil's Capacity. Butit\nis\ncertain this was\na\nDivination done in dead Animals\nby\nthe Use\noftheir Blood, and therefore the Word\nis\nde\nrived from the Greek vixefivi which signifies\nDead, and Martha, which signifies Divination.,\nThe fourth Species\nis\ncalled Divination by\nthe Pythian*,, which was taken from Apollo,\nthe first Diviner, as Thomas Aquinas soys in\nhis Secundd secund\u0153 qit. 95. Artie.\n3.\nThe fifth\nis\ncalled Geomancy, which\nis\nwhen\nthe Devil teaches any Thing\nby\ncertain Signs\nappearing in the Earthly Bodies, as\nin\nWood,\nIron, or polished Stones, Beryls, or Glass.\nThe sixth\nis\nnamed Hydromancy, as when\na\nDamon teaches any Thing by Appearances\nin, the Water.\n-The seventh\nis\nstiled \u00c6romancy\n;\nwhich\nis\nwhenhe informs People of such Things by\nFigures\nin\nthe Air.\nY\nThe\n\f314 The Life and Adventures\nThe Eighth is entituled Pyromancy j that\nis,\nwhen\nit\ninstructs People\nby\nForms appear\ning\nin\nthe Fire.\nThe Ninth\nis\ntermed Arnspicy\nj\nwhich\nis,\nwhen by Signs appearing\nin\nthe Bowels of\nsa\ncrificed Animals the D\u00e6mon predicts at Altars.\n\u2022\nThus far, as to express Divination, or Invo\ncation of the Devil, which\nis\ndetestable, and\nthe very consulting of Persons, that use such\nunlawful Means,\nis\naccording to the Judg\nment of all Casuists, the high Road to eter\nnal Damnation.. ' *\nNow as to tacit Divination or Invocation\nof the Devil, that\nis\ndivided into two subal\ntern kinds. The first Kind\nis,\nwhen for the\nfake of knowing hidden Things, they make\nuse of\na\nvain and superstitious Disposition\nexisting in Things to judge from\n;\nwhich'\nDisposition\nis\nnot of\na\nsufficient Virtue to lead\nthem to any real Judgment. The second\nKind of tacit Divination\nis,\nwhen that\nKnowledge\nis\nsought by the Disposition of\nthose Things, which Men effect on purpose\nand of their own accord,\nin\norder to come\nby and acquire that Knowledge.\nBoth these Kinds of tack Divination are\nagain subdivided into several Species, as are\nparticularly mentioned by St. Tho. Aquin. Se-\ncimda Secundx. Qu\u00e6st. 95. Artie.\n3.\nGregory\nde Valentine, Tomo\n3.\nDispute\n6\".\nquaest. 12.\npuncto x. Toletus\nin\nSumma.

Christ, cap. 19. & sequent.\nThe first of these Kinds of tacit Divination,\ncontains under it the following several species.\nThe first Species is called Genethliacaly\nwhich is, when from the Movement or Situa\ntion of the Stars,' Men's Nativities are calcula\nted and enquired into\nso\nfar, as that from such\na\nSearch they pretend to deduce the Know\nledge of human effects, and the contingent\nEvents that are to attend them. This Thomas\nAquinas, and Sixtus Quintus condemns\n;\nbut\nI\nshall with Humility and Submission to great\ner Judgments enquire hereafter into their Rea\nsons, and give my Opinion why\nI\nthink this\nno evil Art\n5\nbut\nI\nsubmit my Opinion,\nif,\nafter\nit\nis\ngiven,\nit\nis\nthought erroneous.\nThe second\nis\nAugury, when any Thing\nis\npredicted from the chattering of Birds, or the;\nvoice of Animals, and this may be either law\nful, or unlawful. If\nit\ncomes from natural in\nstinct (for brutes having only\na\nsensitive soul,\nhave their organs subject to the Disposition of\nthe greater Bodies in which they are contain\ned, and principally of all to the Celestial Bo\ndies) his augury\nis\nnot amiss, for\nif\nwhen\nCrows are remark'd to Kaw (as the Vulgar\nPhrase\nis)\nmore than ordiniary^\nit\nis\njudging\naccording to the instinct of their Nafure,if we\nexpect Rain\nj\nand we may reasonably depend\nupon\nit,\nwe shall be right\nif\nwe foretell Rain to!\nbe at Hand. But sometimes the Devils actuate\nthose\n\f$i6 The Life and Adventures\nthose Brute Animals to excite vain Ideas in\nMen, contrary to what the instinct of their\nNature compels them to. This is superstiti\nous and unlawful, and forbid in holy Writ.\n, The Third is Aruspicjr, when from the Flight\nof Birds, or any other Motion of any Animals\nwhatsoever, Persons pretend to have an in\nsight and a penetrative Knowledge into oc-:\ncult and hidden Matters.\n: The fourth consists in omens, when for\nExample a Man from any Words which others\nmay have spoken on Purpose or by Accident,\npretends to gather a way of looking into and\nknowing any Thing of Futurity.\n. The fifth is Chiromancy\n',\u25a0\nwhich consists\nin\nmaking\na\npretence to the Knowledge of\nfu\nture Things by the Figures and the Lines of\nthe Hands\n:\nAnd\nif\nit\nbe\nb.y\nconsulting the\nShoulder-bones of any Beast,\nit\ngoes by the\nName of Spatulamancy.\n-r As the first Kind of Divination, by\na\ntacit\ninvocation of the Devil,\nis\ndivided into the\nfive Species above-mentioned\n;\nso also\nis\nthe\nsecond kind of tacit Divination or invocation *\nof the Devil, divided into two Species by\n3t. Thomas Aquin. Secunda fecund^ qu&~\nsticne nonagefimd quinta articulo tertio, and\ntoo tedious to insert here.\nNow all these Ways are by these Divines\naccounted wicked, and\nI\nset them down that\npeople may avoid them. For how many Gyp\nsies and Pretenders loChyromancy have w'ejn..\nLondon\n\fof Mr. Duncan Campbell^ 817\nLondon and in the Country >\nHow many that\nare for Hydromancy, that pretend in Water\nto sliew Men mighty Mysteries ? And how\nmany in Geomancy, with their Beryls and\ntheir Glades, that, if they are not under the\nInstigation of the Devil, propogate the Scan\ndal at least by being Cheats, and who ought\nto be punished to the utmost Severity, as\nour English Laws enact ? Mr. Campbell, who\nhates, contemns, and abhors these ways, ought,\nmethinks, to be encouraged by their being\nrestrain'd ; and People of curious Tempers,\nwho always receive from him moral and good\nInstructions, which make them happy in the\nConduct of Life, should be animated in a\npublick Manner to consult him, in order to\ndivert the curious Itch of their Humours from\nconsulting such wicked Impostors, or Dia\nbolical practices, as too frequently abound\nin this Nation, by reason of the inquisitive\nVulgar, who are more numerous in our Cli\nmate, than any I ever read of. *\u2022\nBut now to argue the Cafe of conscience\nwith regard to his particular practice by way\nof the Second-Sight, whether, in foro con-\nscientist, it is lawful for him to follow\nit,\nor\nothers to consult him\ni\nThe Divines above-\nmentioned having never had any notice of\nthat Faculty in all Likelihood, or\nif\nthey had,\nnever mentioning\nit,\nmakes\nit\na\nPoint more\ndifficult for me to discuss\n;\nbut\nI\nthink they\nhave stated some Cafes,\nby\nthe making of\nwhich\n\f318 The Life and Adtentuk.es\nwhich my Premises, I can deduce from all\nthe learned Men I have above quoted, a\nConclusion in favour of our Mr. Duncan\nCampbell's and of those who consult him ; but\nmy Opinion shall be always corrected by those\nwho are wiser than my self, and to whom I\nowe entire Submission. I take leave to fix\nthese Premises from them first, and to form\nmy Argument from them afterwards in the\nfollowing manner.\nFirsts It is allowed by all these divines,\nthat a Knowledge which one may have of\nfuture Things within the order of Nature,\nis,\nand may be lawful.\nSecondly\n',\nThey imply, that where justice\nis\nnot violated,\nit\nis\nlawful both to predict,\nand to consult.\nThirdly, Many of them, but particularly\nAureolus puts this question\n:\nIs\nit\nlawful to\ngo to one that deals in the Black Art, to per\nsuade them to cure any innocent Body, that\nanother Necromancer or Dealer\nin\nthe Black\nArt may have maliciously afflicted, and tor\nmented with Pains\n?\nAnd some of these Ca\nsuists, particularly Aureolus, fay,\nit\nis\nlawful\non such an Occasion to go to such\na\nCon\njurer, because the End\nis\nnot Conjuration, but\nfreeing\na\nPerson from it.\nBut\nI\ntake leave to distent from these great\nMen, and think they are\nin\na\ndouble Mistake;\nfirst\n\f.\nof Mr. Duncan Campbell 319\nfirst in stating the question, and then in ma\nking such an Answer, provided the Question\nhad been stated right.\nThe Question is founded upon this Suppo\nsition (which is past by as granted) viz.\nftiat one Necromancer could release a Person\nbewitched by another, which is absolutely\nfalse j for it is against the Nature of the De\nvil to be made an instrument to undo his own\nWorks of Impiety : But admitting, and not\ngranting this to be possible, and the Question\nto be rightly stated, why still these Casuists\nare out in their Answer ? It is lawful, reply\nthey, because the End of going to the Con\njurers is not Conjuration, but freeing a good'\nPerson from it : But the End is not the Point\nhere to be confided, it is the Medium which\nis bad that is to be confident. It is by Con\njuration, (according to their hypothesis) the\nother Conjuration is to be dissolved ,\u2022 and\ndoes not the common Rule, that a Man must\nnot do Evil that Good may come of\nit,\nfor\nbid this practice\n?\nAnd to speak my Opinion\nplainly\nin\nthat Case, the Friend that should\nconsult\na\nConjurer for that End, would be\nonly\nso\nkind to put his own Soul in danger\nof being guilty of Hell-torments, to relieve\nhis afflicted Friend from some bodily Pains,\nwhich\nit\nwould be\na\nVirtue\nin\nhim to suffer\nwith Patience and Resignation.\nOthers, almost all Divines,indeed agree, that\nit\nis\nand may be lawful to go to\na\nconjurer\nthat\n\f310 The Life and Adventures *\nthat torments another, and give him money-\nnot to afflict the Patient any longer ; because\nthat is only seeing him to desist from acting\nafter his conjuring manner.\nThese Premises thus settled, if \\Oe-allpw\nthe Second- Sight to be in-born and in-brea,\nand natural and common to some Families,\nwhich is proved in the Book ; and if all that\nMr. Campbell has predicted in that Second-\nsighted Way terminates with moral Advice,\nand the profit of the Consulter, and without\nthe Violation of justice to others, as the\nBook (hews all throughout ; if he can relieve\nfrom Witchcraft, as it seems Oath is to be\nhad he can, which no one that deals in the\nBlack Art can do, why then I need not draw\nthe Conclusion, every Reader will do it na\nturally ; they will avow all the strictest Laws\nof Casuistry and Morality to be in favour of\nMr. Campbell and his Consumers.\nFINIS.\n\f[ B Q O K S\nSold by\/ \u00a3.JC U R L U\nA T\nPope's-kead, in Ro\/e-Jlreet, Covent-garden.\nMsctllamts.
