I submitted to the Society a paper on\n\"Automatic Writing,\" in which I endeavoured to explain certain\nphenomena-too often ignored (as I thought) by one school, too hastily\nreferred to extra-human agencies by another-by the hypothesis of a\nsecond centre of ~ntation potentially existing within our own brains,\nand called into action by some underlying energy of our own.\nI did not assert, and I do not suppose, that tbis hypothesis would\nexplain all the reported cases of automatic writing. On the con~rary,\nI am still endeavouring to collect instances which clearly go beyo-nd my\nhypotbesis, for discussion in another paper. My appeal for such case&-\nespecially for anything which may tend to establish the identity of a\nDigitized by Google\n\fDec..l885.] Journal of &ciet!lfor Pl!Jckical RuIu,v:I,. 123\noommumcating intelligence-has received a very scanty response. I\ncan only repeat it, with a renewed assurance of the profound interest\nwhich these more advanced cases, if really provable, must possess.\nBut in the meantime the hypothesis of an unconscious self has shown\nitself, at any rate, 80 far appropriate to the present state of our\nknowledge, that it has been independently urged by several GermaJl\nwriters of high repute, and has received illustration and corroboratiou\nfrom a great number of French experiments undertaken with other\nobjects in view. In England, too, such criticisms as have appeared\nfrom non-Spiritualistic quarters have been for the most part favourable,\na feeling having apparently gained greund that the abnormal\nphenomena of which I have treated do really exist, and that the\nhypothesis suggested is worth discussion. The Spiritualistic organa, ou\nthe other band, have been dissatisfied with a view which at any rate\nmuch narrows the field in which the operation of disembodied intelli-\ngeuces can plausibly be invoked.\nSuch dissatisfaction is perhaps natural; yet I cannot help hoping\nthat reflection may convince Spiritualists that, if their theory be in the\nmain true, it cannot but gain by such discussion as I have attempted.\nFor no theory 80 important and novel has ever acquired a hold on the\neducated world without full and frank debate, without the strenuoWl\nattention of minds numerous and different enough to view the facts\nin dispute in every possiblo light. If Spiritualism be regarded merely\nas an additional dogma designed to win emotional credence from chosen\nsouls, then a disturbance of that, as of other religious dogmas, will be\nmet. with resentment and alarm. But if it be regarded-as surely its\nesteemed leaders do regard it-as a system of facts possessing not only\nahigh emotional but a high scientific value,-then the desire must be to\nsee it built up as other sciences have been built and are now building,\nby the shock of many theories, and as the ou~ of many divergent\n,lines of experimentation. For my part, the t \u2022 g that seems to me\nsurest is, that however the strange mass of\u00b7 pernormal phenomena\nmay be ultimatdy explained, any theory which the wisest of us could\nauggest at this incipient stage of the long inquiry ,vill be seen to have\nbeen but a rude and shallow approximation to the truth.\nSome earnestly-written papers by the Hon. Roden Noel, in\nLig'\" for October 24th and succeeding numbers, give expression to\nthe feeling of dissatisfaction above mentioned; and my respect for\nMr. Noel naturally suggests the selection of these papers, from amongst\nothers by critics of less note, as a first text f01\" my reply.\nI find myself, however, much embarrassed by a want which is\ndaily becoming more conspicuous; the absence, namely, of any\nreeogniaed English text-book embracing all abnormal conditiol18 of\nmind, to which reference may be made in such discussions as th~\nG 121\nDigitized by oog e\n\f124 JOItI\"lIal qf Societ!l .fOI\" PsycMC(\/! &8('(\/1\"('1,. [Dec.,1885.\nThe valuable works of Drs. Carpenter and Maudsley are somewhat\nslnaller in scope, and hardly abreast of recent investigation; the\nlight-bringing tractates of Dr. Hughlings Jackson are scattered and not\npopularly known; and M. Ribot's admirable monographs on the\nmaladies of the memory, the will, the personality, cover only a\nportion of the wide field. Yet some knowledge of these and similar\nworks must necessarily be presupposed if our discussion is to be\nmore than a merely verbal controversy. In this branch of psych-\nology, at any rate, we cannot afford to ignore physiological data. If\nwe attempt to take 1\\ \"high priori road,\" we shall be in danger\nof finding ourselves not above, but below, the current physiological\nconceptions of the day,-of reverting to the cruder explanations of a\npre-scientific age.\nWhen Mr. Noel, for instance, suggests that madness may be \"due\nto converse with genii or dremolls\" (Light, p. 530), or that ordinary\nhallucinations and dreams involve\" spiritpi action from without upon\nthe individual\" (p. 530), or that\" the \\K-ea.m-personages who converse\nwith the sleepers are verily spirits\" * (p. 530), one begins to see the\ndangers of a too resolute avoidance of any contaminating knowledge of\nthe labours of the ma.terialistic school. \"~Von ragionam di lor,\"\nexclaims Mr. Noel (p. 516), \"111.0, glumla e paisa!\" but the single\nglance of disdain with which the medireval poet contented himself \\\\--ill\nscarcely equip the modern disputant for a triumphant course of polemic.\nThus, again, I note that Mr. Noel, though it appears (p. 58i) that\nhe is cognisant of the class of actions commonly known as \"secondarily\nautomatic,\" has hardly realised of what such actions consist. For,\nwhereas it is a well-known fact that (for instance) a girl playing on the\npiano can often remember the tune better with her fingers than with\nher head, Mr. Noel considers it a grotesque notion (p. 515) that\" I\ninform myself through the muscles of my hand of whll.t I did not know-\nand yet I did know-only without consciousness.\" Somewhat similarly,\nbut with a more complicated confusion, he supposes (p. 5IG) that\nexperiences which \"enter the current of normal consciousness through\nour brain,\" are necessarily first apprehended as central and not as\nperipheral sensations. Again, he asks the question, \" At what limit of\nfeet or inches does one identity stop and another begin ,\" as though\nit were a reductio ad absurdum of views which could make the question\n\u2022 In one respect Mr. Noel certainly concedes more to the tmconsciou8 self\nthan I should be disposed to claim for it. For he holds (p. 556) that \"if 1\ndream of a pel\"llOn in II. position in which he is not, 80 far B8 his nonnal COD-\nsciousneB8 is concerned,\" .. it is difficultto account for the appearance,\" without\nHOme 8uch hypothesL'! aq that of an actual secondary sell of that p8J\"11On's, which\nis where I dream of him. Thus, if I dream that Mr. Bradlaugh 18 seated on the\nwoolsack, and he is not there corporea.lly, his spiritual self is there nevertheleSl!.\nAt this rate I can ollly hope that Illy friends will not dream that I am in-well,\n.831 in Texas.\n\f~\u2022\u2022 l885.] Jot.rnal oj 80delll lor PS!lchical Research. 125\npossiblc; not knowing, apparently, that, whether absurd or not, this is\na recognised form of medico-legal inquiry in cases of monstrous birth.\nStill more surprisingly, Mr. Noel supposes (p. 556)-or, rather, states\nthat he has \"shown elsewhere\"-that \"the very fact of one's remem-\nbering a person at all proves his transcendent reality-the transcen-\ndent reality of his past, out of which he influences us to remember\nhim\": so that, by analogy, my recollection of a. squib which I let oft'\nas a boy shows that the transcend~nt reality of that squib is still\ninfluencing me to remember it.\nI Joight greatly extend this list of what my readers will, perhaps,\nconsider as misapprehensions of a somewlmt rudimentary kind. But I\nam by no means anxious to do this; for I do not do Mr. Noel the\ninjustice of accusing him of pretending to a knowledge which he does\nnot possess. My argument is rather that without some endeavour to\nbring our theori~ into harmony with established physiological facts our\ndiscourse on these perplexing topics will be equally facile and barren.\nNothing is easier or more attractive than to wander over the psychical\nfield, supporting our favourite theories, whenever we desire it, by an\nappeal to the convenient authority of \"intuition.\" \" Such an inspira.\ntion as that referred to,\" says Mr. Noel, speaking of the somnambulist's\n\" guides\" (p. 543), \"is more probably what intuition discerns, the\nin.Ilowing of the Holy Spirit, which, while we are still earth-bound, is\nrather primarily the influence of more ele,-a.ted or advanced souls or\nangels, than tha.t of our own holier consciousness, though assuredly this\nalso may be aroused into momentary glow and fervour by their exalted\nministration.\" \"Assuredly,\" to use Mr. Noel's word, it will be very\n~areeable if this is the case; but one would like to feel rather morQ\ncertain as to his special source of information.\n\"Surcly, surely,\" exclaims Mr. Noel again (p. 588), remonstrating\n~\"Ilinst the.too physiological aspect of our Proceedings; \"surely, surely\nwe are on the wrong tack! Physiology is a bli~ alley, an unreliable\nally. Must we, indeed, throw this sop to the feitgeist Cerberus, or\nwon't hc let us pass I\"\nNow, in reply to this earnest utterance I would venture to say that\nphysiology (whether Mr. Noel decides to call it an alley or an ally) is, at\nany rate, an indispensable factor in every one of the problems which\nwe are here discussing. I do not mean that we Psychical Researchers\nought all of us to be able to pass a stiff examination in physiology,\nthough I think that a special training like Mr. Gurney's is a very great\nadvantage; but I mean that, d+'~i,r aDd half-instructed though we may\nbe,we are bound to use our very best endea,\u00b7ours to master the physiologi-\ncal side of each phenomenon before we attempt to assign its psychical\nTalue. Most fortunately for us, physiological conceptions are not, for\nthe most part, expressed in algebraical fOl\u00b7mulre, and a layman of\nDigitized by Google\n\f126 J\"u''M1 of Society for P8ychical RR8earch.

Speculatively -if my speculativeopinions\nare to be alluded to-I am as pure an idealist as Mr. Noel himself. I,\ntoo, suppose-if we are to indulge in supposition-that this \"isible\nuniverse itself only exists in the minds which perceive it, and that ~me\nintelligence wrought otherwise than ours might swoop from end to end\nof our thron!;e<i galaxy, unhindered and unknowing, and heedlessly as\n& sea-mew winging above the bones of sunken men.\n\" There the sunlit ocean tosses,\nO'er them mouldering,\nAnd the lonely seabird Cl'088eB\nWith one waft of the wing.\"\nBut neither Mr. Noel nor I are likely to prot'e this interesting thesis,\n&nd in the meantime we are surely bound to remember (what! fear\nthat Mr. Noel sometimes forgets) that although the physical laws which\nregulate phenomena are as unreal as anything else, yet they are also\nas real as anything else, and we cannot get any nearer to the truth by\nonly looking at the phenomena and shutting our eyes to the laws. \"Some\n(\n. men have said,\" remarked the cautious divine, \"that things in general\nare dangerous. But on the other hand, my brethren, we must\n\\ remember that there is no safety in anything ill particular.\"\n\\ Thus much it seems needful to say, in general answer to Mr. Noel's\nmethod of argument. But in the present state of the inquiry, in which\nwe are all groping somewhat blindly among theories whose complew\npurport we can scarcely seize, it would be undesirable to spend much\nspace on smaller points of controversy. To some of Mr. Noel's difficul-\nties he must already have seen my reply-if I am right in intt>rpreting\nIris words\" see NineteentJ, Cent'lJ,1\"'IJ,\" (p. 575) to mean that he has read a\npaper of mine which appeared in the ContemporfJ1\"'IJ Review. For some\nother points I would have referred him to an article on \"Human\nPersonality,\" in the Fortniu1ttly for November, 1885, but that I observe\nthat he cites it (p. 556) in defence of a \"transcendental self which is in\nProvidential, intuitive harmony with that of the mesmeriser,\" from\nwhich I gather that he interprets that essay in sOlpe occult\nmanner, to which I can as yet find no clue. This slight tAakntendu,\nhowever, is more than compensated by the admirable candour with\nwhich Mr. Noel states (p. 587) that \"circumstances had prevented [his]\nreading till now\" the paper of mine in Proceeding. VIII., whose\nconclusions his own five previous a.rticles have been engaged in refuting.\nIt is a solid satisfaction in controversy to feel assured that one's critic,\nafter actual perusal of one's work, sees no reason to alter the judgment\non it which he has already expressed.\n\fDec.,1885.J JOIlNUJI fit Societyfor P8!JcAical ReuarcA. 127\nConsidering, then, how unfamiliar is this whole tract of thought.\nhow slight are the clues which any of us possess to guide us through its\nmazes, I think that what I ought first to attempt is to give some sort\nof precision to the terms which we have constantly to use, and which\nit is evident that we interpret in many dift'erent ways.\nThe process may, perhaps, be a tedious one, but I must say once for\nall that if one inch of &88ured ground is gained in these mattera-at\nwhatever cost of tedious elaboration or minute analysis-there will be\nno need of any apology. What does need apology is just the opposite\ndefect-namely, the inevitable slightness and sketchinea of the work\nwhich any of us can do at present in an inquiry whose data are &8 yet\nso scanty and obscure.\nAnd first. &8 to the words\" conscious .. and \"consciousness,\" which\nare among the most difficult and important of all.\nII The terms consciousness and automatism,\" justly remarks Dr.\nIreland,* \"are terms which in medical treatises are used with various\nmeanings, sometimes by the same authors on dift'erent pages. Though\nI cannot define consciousness, I can surely make the reader understand\nwhat I mean by being conscious. I feel, I touch, I smell, I hear, I\nsee, I desire, I love, I suffer, I fear, I hope, I think, I imagine, I will;\nall this means that I am conscious.\"\nBefore attempting to give something more of definiteness to our\nnotion of what consciousness is, I may just indicate the way in which\nHr. Noel employs this difficult term.\n\"An unconscious self,\" says Mr. Noel (p. 515), \"could not possibly\nbe thul identified with a conscious.\" \"It must always remain alien, and\nOIltside consciousness,\" he continues, \"and therefore it cannot belong\nto the same self at all. . . \u2022 The unconscious caJlDot identify\nitself with the conscious, Dor 'Vice wrBC1\"\nThis last sentence seems to me a typical illustration of the danger\nof using words &8 metaphysical counters, Dot &8 definite representations\nof observed facts. I do not ,mean merely that it is a lliglU\" ab.tract\naentence; highly abstract sentences are, of course, necessary in their\nplace; but they should fulfil this test :-they should be capable of being\ntranslated or expanded into concrete terms. But this sentence, I think,\ncan only seem true so long &8\" the conscious\" and \"the unconscious \"\nare kept &8 mere symbols-like the\" A and not-A\" of the abstract\nlogician. As soon &8 we endeavour to attach a concrete definite\nmf'&Ding to the two terms here used, we find that the whole difficulty\nlies in knowing what really is A and what is not A, and what kincl of\nrelations the two do in fact bear to one another.\nLet us, then, look at the problem a little more closely. Agreeing\nwith Dr. Ireland that a satisfactory definition of consciousness is almost\n\u2022 \"The Blot upon tbe Brain,\" p. 235.\nDigitized by Google\n\f128 Journal of Society for PS1lcMcai RtuarcA. [Dec.,1885.\nimpossible, let us try to get, at least, to sufficiently close quarters with\nthe idea to avoid such constantly recurring misapprehensions as disguise\nsubstantial agreement, and impede systematic advance.\nIt is commonly said that C01I8cioumus is a notion so simple and ulti-\nmate that no description thereof can be offered, which is not obscurer\nthan the word itself. This may be so ; but nevertheless there must\nbe some expression which is nearly equivalent; there must be somc\ntest which we apply when we are asked whether any cerebral action, of\nour own or other people's, is accompanied by consciousness or not.\nA little consideration shows that we do in fact apply two teats. We\nask whether the cerebral action is complez, and we ask whether it is\ncapable of being remembered.\nFor instance: the question has been discussed whether the acts which\na hypnotised subject performs under suggestion, and which he has com-\npletely forgotten when he wakes, are to be considered as accompanied\nwith consciousness. It is then argued that the acts are comple:l:--that.\nthey resemble acts which in our waking selves are always accompanied\nby consciousness, and that therefore they must be classed as conscious_\nAnd this argument is strengthened by the remark that in a second\nhypnotic trance the subject remembers the acts do;J in the first.\nAgain, the same question is mooted as regards \"08t-epileptic states.\nAfter an attack of epilepsy,\u00b7 a man may remain for some minutes, hours.\nor even days,- in a state in which ordinary consciousness is completely\ninterrupted, while, nevertheless, he is able to perform complex acts, as\nspeaking, eating, climbing, dr;c. Now there is not as yet (so far as I\nknow), any casa where a series ofpost-epileptic acts have been provably\nremembered in a succeeding poat-epileptic period. We feel, therefore,\ntb,at the argument for c~ as accompanying these acts is at\npresent incomplete. Yet the analogy of the remembrance of hypnotic\nmemories--and, in one often cited case, of dru,lken memories-as well\nas the observed identity of recurrent epileptic 11411ucinntiomin the same\nsubject, may lead us to anticipate that these post-epileptic states may\nhave a thread of inter-connection, and may be all of them conceivably\nrememberable after each fresh fit.\nI cite this instance here, however,only to show the kind of consider-\nations to which we have to resort if we are called on to describe any\ncerebral operations as accompanied by consciousness or the reverse. It\nseems that the complexity of an act alone does not suffice to convince us\nthatthe act has been conscious.We keep recurring to the questionwhether\n\u00b7The moet marked case of this kind with which I am acquainted, is cited by\nDr. Ireland (\"BlotupontheBrain,\"po 347)fromtlte.AmericanJoumalojIfllflnUy.\nJuly, 1873. In this case the patient, though a landsman, shipped as a lI&ilor in\n'he poet\u00b7epileptic state, and was several days before returning to normal con-\n..ioumeas.\nDigitized by Google\n\fDec., 1885.) J()fIrnal qf &cietu for P,!\/cAical Rtaearcll. 129\ntheact is ever remembered. And, indeed, is not this the best description\nof our own conscious acts and sensations 1 They are acts which we\nI j't'nemher. Even to realise them at all in consciousneBB requires, as\n~:cho-physiologists have shown us, a certain.J\u00a5eaBurable period. When\nmy hand is pinched, and I feel it, a longer lCeural process takes place\nthan if my hand were pinched while I was under chloroform. And if\nI become what is called fuUy comciotU that someone is pinching my\nhand-that is, if I not only feel the sensation, but attmd to it, a still\nlonger time is necessary. And one result or concomitant of this\nexpenditure of time is that I can recollect the sensation afterwards.\nMy consciousness has itself been a sort of remembrance, and it has\nthen transformed itself into another sort of remembrance.\nLet us give some common name ~ all acts or sensations- which have\nreached a pitch of intensity such as to enable them at SODle future time\nto reappear in memory. We will not call them rtl1Wl1lberabk; for than\nword has acquired a narrower, but useful, meaning. By rememberable\nwe usually mean m:olkct-Gbk; capable of being voluntarily brought\nback into memory. Let us take lI~k for our wider word j for the\nspecial connotation of \"memorable,\"-i.e., duerring of being remem-\nbered,-is not germane to these discUBBions, nor likely to confuse us.\n~\nd let us, by way of an experiment in definition, say that conacious\nmeans memorabk, and describe those operations as conscious which\nhaye reached a sufficient pitch of intensity to be capable of reappearing\nin the field of memory if a favourable occasion recurs. We will\num to this definition when we have glanced at some of the facts\nwhich may test its usefulness. Meantime, and taking this as a\nprovisional definition of consciousness, my contention is, noe, as\nlOme of my critics seem to suppose, that a man (say Socrates) has\nwithin him a conscious and an unconscious self, which lie side by side,\nbut apart, and find expreBBion alternately, but rather that Socrates'\nmind is capable of concentrating itself round more than one focus,\neither simultaneously or successively. I do not limit the number of the\nloci to two, and I do not suppose that the division of the brain into two\nhemispheres is the only neural fact corresponding to the psychical fact\nalleged. I do not venture to localise my hypotheticalfDei to any extent\nbeyond the limits which the localisations of cerebral faculty (as of\nspeech and writing), otherwise established, may be held to justify.\nThe position which I have ultimately to defend is this: That one\nfocus of potEntial (not necessarily of actual) consciousneBS in Socrates\nIDaY acquire knowledge or perform operations not acquired or performed\nby another focus, and may communicate such knowledge or the result\nof such operations thereto in ways to which we can at present assign\nno definite limit; and with varying degrees of subjective fusion\nl.etwcen the more or less separated centres of mentation.\nDigitized by Google\n\f130 Journaloj' &cictgfo,. P8!1cMcai ReuQI\u00b7cA. [Dec.. 188.').\nThis thesis is unavoidably cumbrous; I will support it by\nillustrations, as brief and easy as I can make them, from familiAr\ncerebral phenomena.\nLet us take, in the first place, what are called the inBpircltior&& of\nDenim. I conceive that these inspirations may be best understood as\nhidden transferences, from thfl unconscious to the conscious mind, of\nideas which have already attained an unusual degree of force or\nelaboration. When the words .. Ma,.t6mque a.ccfltuUre cantu\" (the\nunique and long-sought completion of a majestic but truncated hexa-\nmeter) flashed into Virgil's mind (as tradition tells us) at a stroke, I\nconceive that it was a phenomenon of the same kind as the Calculating\nBoy's sudden perception of the cube root of some high number. In\neach case the 'unconscious brain was able to pour, if I may so say, a\nstream more than usually nutritious into the conscious channel, to\nJlupply results of completed excellence without any perceptible efrort 'of\n.discovery or choice. Genius thus in a certain sense illustrates the rule\nthat all nervous action tends to become rell.ex-is, at any rate, more\n-exactly efficient as it approaches the reflex type. Just as the spinal\ncentres of a great skater are better organised than mine, and enable\nhim to balance himself without conscious efrort in attitudes where my\nwhole attention would not suffice to keep me erect, even so Virgil's\nbrain, orMr. Bidder's,accomplished automatically and without attention\nwhat, perhaps, no other human being could have rivalled by any amount\n~f conscious strain. The man of genius is inapired, no doubt, but be\nis inspired by his own unconscious self.\nAnd here, perhaps, lies the real alliance between \"great wits and\nmadness.\" The madman, like the man of genius, feels the inrush of\nideas which have acquired a high degree of concentration and energy\nbefore they enter the conscious stream of existence. They burst upon\nhim as though they were the promptings of an angel or a devil, while\nthey are really the product of a morbid excitement in part of his 0\\\\,11\nbrain. Or, similarly, he walks rapidly and without fatigue because\nthe centres which govern this movement do not report themseh'es\nproperly to anyone presiding authority,-have pro tanto dissociated\nthemselves from his conscious self. Thus the ordinary man is like the\nmaster of a small business, who governs his subordinates thoroughly,\nbut has all the trouble of thinking out what each of them is to do. The\nmadman has not this trouble; but bis subordinatc& rush wildly o.llOut\nand his business goes to ruin.

Still he\naffords us our best chance ofdoing what we must plainly desire; that is\nof placing the threshold of consciousness just where we want it to be, 80\nthat we may be unconscious not only of our aches and pains, but of our\nfirst blundering misapprehensions and distressing efforts at thought,\nwhile we retain the conscious control and disposition of all the\nmaterial which these back-shops of our brain have worked up.\nI do not wish, however, in the present paper, to go beyond the\ndiscussion of normal waking life.

In the man of genius the two\nfactors are concordant and collaborath-e; they fuse into the highest\nservice of the one identity. But then-since the ascription to me of\nunproved hypotheses which are not mine compels me to mention the\nunproved hypothesis which v-I conceive that precisely the same\nconcordance and collaboration underlies all the supernormal partitions\nof a primary and a secondary self. I conceive that one transcendentat'J\nself in each of us, behind the phf'nomenal, works with manifold\nhindrance and imperfection through the nerve-centres which are as tho\nlooms which express and specialise its informing power, and weaves our\nbeing's varying tapestry with the unity of a single impulse, and of no\ndesign from long ago.\nFRBDBRIe 'V.

P.\nIn June, 1880, Mrs. B., widow of General B., now living at The --.\n--, took the lease of R-- Nunnery, near H--, from the Hon. Mrs. R..\nwho llerself held it on lease from the owner--. The house, which isan old\none, having actually been a convent, had, as I know, the reputation of being\nhaunted.\nIn July or August of tllat year I went down to stay in the hollSe. 1\noccuI,ied the brown room. On the evening of my arrival, it being then\nbright twilight, 1 left lily room to fetch some hot water. I went along the\nlJassage and down the three steps leading to the new part of the hollSe. The\ndoor at the end of the passage leading into Mrs. Ormerod',:, room stood open.\nand there is also a skylight in the now part of tho houso, so that both th~\npassage and the steps were fairly light. On the stel)S I paesed a figure.\nwhich I took to be the housemaid, tall, slender, dressed in black, and white\nhair, and, 1 think, a cap on her head. As the steps were very narrow, I\nthought it rather rude of the housemaid to paes me, and 110t rather to stand\naside and make way for me. I made a remark to thisefl'ecttoMra. Fletcher.\nthe housekeeper. The next morning, however, I saw the housemaid-&\nshort, dumpy person-and felt convinced that hers W:lS not the figure I\nhad met.\nOn thinking the matter over afterwards, it struck lIle as odd that I could\nnot recollect that the figure had touched me as it paesed me. Afterwards I\nheard from Mrs. B. par~iClllars of the figure seen by Mrs. Ormerod in the\nautumn of the same year, and I came to the conclusion that I had aeen the\n8aJlle figure. In confirmation of this Mrs. B. told me that the figure was\nreported to have been aeen more than once on those 8aJlle stairs.\nIn the autumn of 1881 Mrs. Ormerod, an old lady of between 60 and 70,\nthe widow of a Welsh clergyman, who was stopping in the house, was Bitting\nin her bedroom one afternoon, in broad daylight, when she heard the door\nopened, and turning round, saw a tall, Blender figure, dressed all in black.\nwith anowy hair, and, apparently, a cap on tIte head. The figure disappeared,\nand Mrs. Ormerod went in to Mn. B. to ask her why she had come in in\nthat odd way and fri~htelled her. Mrs. B. had not been in the room.\nThis 8aJlle figure is said to have been seen also by some of tIte servants.\nAll this I heard from Mrs. B., in the autumn of 1881.\nOne very hot Sunday in July (or perhaps. August) of 1881, I was again\nstopping at R-- Nunnery. I was lying on my bed ill the afternoon, some.\ntinte between three and five p.m., .and I had just closed my book, feeling my\neyes rather tired. The door was ol)en, and looking up, I saw a figure going\nup tho t.hreo steps outside the door, and proceeding ill the direction of one\nof the spare bedrooms. The tigure was that of a short lady of a springy\nfigure, in all old-fashioned dress, high-waisted, with bib, and short puff'\nalee\\\"OB, and long mittena on the arms.

I saw the-figure in profile. I followed it at once into theroom,\ninto which it must have gone, and from which there was no otheroutlet, and\nlIIl&l'Ched the room thoroughly, but could find no trace of anyone.\nI have not heard of this figure having been seen by anyone else : but I\nh:l\\'e heard from Mrs. B. thatseveral figures have been seen at different times\nby the IIOrvants.\nIn September or October, 1881, I was sitting in my room-the brown\nroom-ataboutsix p.m. one afternoon, with my head resting on my hand, as\n1folt very tired. It was still broad daylight. I turned round, IUld saw\natanding about two yards from me, a tall, slender figure, dressed entirely in\nblack, with snow white hair, and a cap on the head. But the face W88 what\natruc:k me particularly. It was pale, with an expreBSion which I can hardly\ndescribe-and which I do not now like to recall-an expreBSion flf extreme\ngrief or despair. The figure vanished immediately. From the dreBS and\ngeneral appearance I recognised the figure as the same I had seen on tho\n.tairs about a year before.\nMost extraordillary noises were heard at various times both by myselfand\nothers in the house.\nMrs. B. left the hoUllO in March, 1882.

C., with\nher two daughtera, went to live at a plaoo called \" B--fields \"\n... ... .. in the leaae.... ... .. It was an old house, 1611\ncut somewhere in the roof. The rent seemed extraordinarily small-\u00a380 3\nyear with taxes-especially aa there wero about seven acres of fine grasa\nfields.... * \u2022\nAfter they were settled and a little building done and a great deal of\nmoney spent-the lease waafor 7, 14, 21 yoara-I heard a whisper that the\nhouse waa hauntod.\nI knew a young lawyer, Mr. S., who had managed all the busin08l of\nB--fields, and I asked him to dinner to question him. He said a black\nfigure haunted the house, that he had seen it, and that it appeared only in\ntIle months of November and January. I was very angry at his telling my\nsister, '111\"'0 had to iil'fl thef'~, this, and I tried to perauade myself and her it\nWal all a giddy young man's invention.\nThe following Christmas, 1877, I went to stay at B--fields ; the house\nhad been painted and papered with the most cheerful tints, the weather\naunny, sparkling with hoar frost; we were a merry party. It didn't seem\nthe least like a haunted place, and ghosts seemed 'Iuite impo88ible.\n. When the month of .Januarycame I remembered the story, and I confeas\nI peeped aboutin a great fright, expecting lOme awful shape in every fold of\ndrapery, every corner, every shadow; but 10 days paued, the whole month\npaased, and I made up my mind it waa all nonsense, and I had completely\njorgotunit. One night, the last of January, I waa coming out of lily room\nto wish my mother good-night in her room, near. It waa nearly 11, thr.\nlanding on which my door opened waa lit with two large spirit lamps, flooded\nwith light. Opposite to me, against UI~ ~riyhtly litup lIIall, stood a huge\nblack figure. It is difficult to describe, it waa largtr tJ141~ Zife, almost touched\nthe ceiling, an a Ic\/nUy tJtijf thing, covered with black mantle over head and\nall ; I could see no face. I felt aa if it warned me away : don't come near,\ndon't touch me !! I did not feel tl~ lta4t fear, only a IOrt of breathless\nsurprise, an intense anxiety to look at it before it was gone. While I looked\none might have counted 20 ; itdisappeared from the feet upwards, nnd was\ngone into the air. I could see again the light wall, and the pictures that had\n~ell hidden by the huge, solid black figure.\nI did not feel the least aIra.id. I passed the place where it had swod,\nwent to my mother's room, talked to her a little. I only felt I must tell no\none ; but when I got to my room a terror fell uJlon me. The maid slept in\nthe room, but I did not tell her anything. I thought they hare to lire htrt,\nand if tIley know they will all run out of the house.\nThe next day I went on a \"i.it to Mrs. S., W-- Hall , Shrewsbury.

Wales. A part of tht!\n001118 we occupied waa very old, and the rooms we chiefly used were in that\npart.. I must premise by saying that, when we went to the houae, nothing\nhad been told us of any noiaea heard in it, nor did there aeem to be any Itury\nor traditionattached to the place. About March, in 1872, our nurse grew very\nDO\"OUS; repeatedly abe aaaerted that her Ileep was disturbed by the\nappearances of sometimes a woman and child, sometimes two women. She.\nllept with the hoy in a large room (near to our bedroom), which was\ndivided by .. wooden partition into a day and night nursery. One Ipring\nevening, my husband and 1 came home about 6.30 p.m., and found the.\nIlerVlnts oonaideJably excited. The nurse had gone to the kitchen tea about\nop.m., leaving our boy with a little under-nurse of 16. She ltated that,\ncoming with her charge out of the night nursery, Ihe had aeen sitting on th&\nrug in front of the fire a woman in white, with long black hair, moaning and\nlObbing; the girl caught up the child and rushed down in terror to the-\nkitchen. It W8I broad da,light. This ended the troubles of that fint year,\nbat the head-nuree fell into luch bad health that her mind became affected.\nlIDd ahe had to go away for lOme months.

She was IIleeping in the room\nthat had been the old night-nursery. She had fastened the only door in the\nroom, which was a very 8mall one and without a firepln.ce. The door opt'ued\ninto the day-nursery, and being next to our bedroom W&8 con\\\"enient.

Soon after the church clock tolled the quarter after mid-\nnight, I felt a 8trange shudder come over me, and though all my faculties\nwere alert I could not move. I heard a knocking at the door of the old\nnursery, repeated three time8, and a voice calling aloud for help. The call\nwas repeated se\"eral times, yet I could not stretch out a finger to wake my\nhU8band, or find any voice to speak to him, I !leemed to be in a trance; then\nanother 8hudder came over me and I W88 free, and roused my husband, who\ngot up and searched the house.

MACKENZIE.\nAl\/glIlII, 1866.\nIn the North of Scotland is a houae built on the site \"f a Bishop's Palace,\nand fonning part of the house is an old tower, quite entire, and the ancient\nvaults fonn the ba.aement story of the more modem mansion. The tower\nand \"aults are 8Upposed to have been built in'the 13t.h century. The house\nhas alway8 had the reputation of being haunted, and many, myself amongst\nthe nUlllber, can.tell of a footstep which is often heard, like the footstep of\nan old man promenading along a paaaage at the top of the house.\nThe peasants in the neighbourhood, when asked to relate the story of\nthe haunted house, seem to Bhirk the question, amI their reply invariably\nis, \"Oh, it is an old grey man.\" Many families have reaided in the house,\nand in almoet all of them could be found BOme one ,,'ho has either lecn or\nheard IOmething. The footstep I have heard and shuddered at, but the\nvisible presence of the \"grey man\" I did not credit, when the following\nfact. came to my knowledge, the truth ofwhich I can vouch fur.\nThe gentleman referred to in the following narmtive was one who had\nnever heard that the houle in which he wu at that time a visitor had the\nreputation of being haunted ; moreove!\". he Willi a decided IICtlptic u regarded\nanything Bupernatural; he was Il Doctor of Divinity, and a man of high\nclueical attainment..\nThis gentleman, u I have before remarked, was a villittlr in the haunted\nhouse, and was a8IIigned the bedroom which report said wall the favourite\nreeort of .. the grey man.\" Bef()~ retiring to rest not 1\\ word of wanling,\neither in joke or otherwise, wall lIaid about the l)()8llibility of anything\nsupernatural being aeen by our friend. This fact I wish to be undel'Btocxl\nclearly, to abow that the Reverend Doctor'B imagination was in no way acted\nupon.\nAfter falling uleep he awoke with the feeling that lOme one was ill his\nbedroom, and feeling a heavy weight on one aide of his bed. My friend Bat\nup quite awake; of this he is sure, as he beard the clock vf t11e neighbouring\nCathedral strike the hour, and he also remarked that the wind wa.B high\u2022.\nSeated on the Bide of his bed was all old man, who be fil'Bt imagined must\nbean old aenant, and he examined the figure closely ; it was the figure of an\nold man, dreaaed in a thread-bare grey coat, with long white beard and hair,\nthe latter placed behind the ear, in u style one BOmetimes B888 in an old\npicture. Motionleaa it sat for BOme minutes, when it l'08e, walked round by\nthe bottom of the bed, until reaching the wall beside the fire it tumIKl and\ngued intently on my friend. Then. and not till then, did be imagine that\nwhat ho beheld was anything 8upernatuml.

Spreading its huge hands on the wan. and atill\nlooking at the bed, it vanished, having been in the room for half-an-hour.\nThis my frilmd aacertained by consulting his watch.\nIt baa been alleged that persons who have seen a ghost are most chary of\nspeaking on the subject : this W88 the cue of the Reverend Doctor, who nut.\ntill months after\"ants related the story 1 have given above, and he added\nthat no wealt.h would have tempted him to have slept another night in the\nsame room. Many tried to make the worthy divine confeaa that he miglet\nha,'e been mistaken, but his answer un\"llriably WQ8, ..

No fate waa thought t4\u00bb\ncruel for one who had shown hillllelf 10 mereiJeu to others, and he was con-\ndemned to be confined in one of the vaults of the palace, chained by the neck\nto the wall.\nIn this state he waa kept. for three Ye&l'll, when death put an end to his\n8ufFerings, and his bonos were allowed to whiten in his prison hoWie. bound\nby thechains which had defied the mighty chieftain's streng th.\nNo wonder then that after his death many alleged that they had seen\nthe robber chieftain's spirit haunting the scene of his degradation and miacry.\nstealing along with ita fiendish face and revengeful eyea.\nYeal'll puaed on, and large parts of the palace falling to decay,\na new house was built. on the old '\"aults, and attached to one of the towel8\nof the Bishop'8 residence, and evon in the new house does the \"Grey\nMan\" appear.\nJ.

When the foot.at.t'p WII .coming I heard\ni~ first, or felt it, and would bid others listen; it gave rue a mOllt uncomfort-\nable feeling, and when it paaaed me I felt as if I waa enveloped in a cold,\ndamp mist. We had at 18llt two other yisitors, who said they II&W the old\nKNJ man, but they were ruuch disinclined to speak on the aubject. All old\nlady, Ifra.

My hUlband.\nwho is a aheriff'of the county, doea not believe in ghoets, but he baa heard\nthe footstep and followed it over the houae, thinking BOrne trick WAB being\nplayed. I have noticed that a Scotch terrier pricked up its ean and followed\nthe ltepe, and I did BO alao. They seemed to lead us into a large room, and\nthe dog mUl'ed about, looked up in my face, and gave a howl. I waa once very\nill, in fact. at the point of death; a Highland 11UI'I8, who waa a long time\nwith me, told me that the figure came into the nuraery and bent over her.\nShe waa BO impreued that for years after, while in my service, she\nalept with her Bible under her pillow !-Believe me, very truly yours,\nJ.

At the timo I had 110 thought of the ..grey\nman,\" nor had we beeu talking of it in any way. Tho second time I ..w it\nwas in ea.rly sllring, February, I think. There was a concert in D--,\nan amateur affair, and I sent all the servants to it, seeing dool'll locked and\nthe house cleared myself. My husband broughthis papel'll to the dining\u00b7room,\nwhich was on the same flat or storey as the nursery where I intended sitting.\nI Willi coming out of the dining.room door when I saw something grey go up\nthe staircase toWlln!S the drawing.room and library storey. 1 imagined at\ntil'llt, \"How did I\\nyone got back l\" thinking it Willi one of the maids, when\nthe same feeling came over me as if my hea.rt had become ice, and I was\ndeathly oold. The staircase was well lighted and I diatinctly saw the same\ngrey figure and the same draM as my uncle had described, and I noticed the\nlight shining on the bl'lUll buttons and the metal shoe-buckles. I even ..'tI\"\nthe rough wOl'llted stockings and noticed the very broad ribbing in them.\nWhen the figure got to the top of two storeys every door and windO'tl\"\nbanged and seemed to be shut with violence. I llad not called out to my\nhusband, as I wished to soe if I could make out where the tigure went to and\ninduce him to go after it. He hean! the noises I did, and remarked that\nthe servants must haveleft. wil\\dows open, and that the wind must have risen.\nI suggested he should go and close them, and he went upstairs but soon re-\nturned, saying that every door and window was IIhut, and the night was clear\nand calm. I then tol(l him what I had seen. The footstep is like that of\nan old man with rathera shufBing gait, as if one foot was a little lame. I\nwou1d not have occupied alolUl any room in the castle if I had got the whole\ncounty of Sutherland as a reward. Often I have hoard the footstep come\n!llong the p&l8&ge into my room, and I had always the same feeling, even in\nwann weather, of being enyeloped in a cold damp nliBt, and I felt ill after\nit, BO much BO that 1 used to say I felt I Ihould die if I ever met the grey man\nagain.

The lut\nhrG were negative. On all these occaaiuns I took with me my folding-alate,\nIIICUred by a brau (tadlock. On one occaaion I obtained writing in this alate.\nAt the Jut aitting I prepared. the following question, which wu thus written\non the left.hand flap of the slate: \"Does every man, after death, live again\nin the spirit world with intelligence 1\" As before said, nothing wu obtained,\neither on this alate or on those of tho medium. This wu about the aecond\nweek in Auguat of this year. Since that date it hu been my llractice to hold\nprivate sittings with til\" slate, quit.e alone, placing both hands on the slat&\nafter the maimer o~ychographiata. Thoae trials took place three or four\ntintes weekly, &I1d ~ about half-an\u00b7hour each time. On the l&lt Sunday\nof last month I took up the slate, &I1d feeling somewhat &I1noyed at my\nfailurell, I aat for a fow minutes only, being too impatient to sit &I1y\nlonger, &I1d placod it in ita hiding-place ll1it1WUt o~nillg it, feeling sceptical\n.. to there being anything within. On the following Thursday I unlocked it,\nfeeling IIOme impulao Btl to do, and W&I startled to find the word \"No ,r\nwritten in flowing, somewhat bold, characters on Ihe right-hand flap of the\nalate, opposite to my IluCltion. As there 11\"&1 certainly no writing on this\nside of the alate when lut unlocked, I felt sure that it must Ilave been pro-\nduced on tho occasion when I felt impatient and placed it back without\nopening.\nAs to the answer, I expected, or rather my pre-conceived notions were,\ntllst it should be Yu mther th&Il No, but I now ace that the word \"every ,.\nof course qualifies the answer, there being foola in the Spirit world u well as\nin the Material world. There are four methods by which this writing might\nhave been obtained.\ntat. By means of IIOU10 person tampering with the slate. This is, to my\nknowledge, impouible, the key being in my poaseBBion. &I1d the slate con-\ncealed in a room which is locked up from ten in the moming till nine at\nnight, the key being in the custody of a sen\u00b7ant. The latter, I may add,\nbaa never Been this slate.\n2nd. That it was done at the l&lt seance with Mr. Eglinton. This is out\nof the question u the slate baa been opened fifty times since that event.\n3nl. That I wrote it myself automatically. I must say &I to this that the\nalate is alway. kept locked, &I1d is not easy to open, the key being in one\npart of the room at night and the slate in the other. I am not a s()\\nnam-\nbuliat. I C&Ill1ot reconcile myself to the theory that I mechanically wrote an\nallIwer to i. qUestiOll of a nature COlltrary to what I expected to get. Further,\nsn writing on the right-ll&lld side of the slate is carefully abstained from,\n~bis being the side Ull which psychogmpby is obtained, and, of course, is\nkept carefully clean. Further, I do not believe in the pWlchette, having\nfrequently tried it, nor do I believe in the intrinsic value of so-called AUto-\nmatic writing. This latter I have never attempted, and am not likely to\npractise the laDle on Illy scrupulously clean slate. _\n'th. That the wl'iting was producc~ediulllisticallY:7 I may describe my\n.
