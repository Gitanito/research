[JAN., 1895.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nA Meeting of the Council was held at the Society's Rooms on\nFriday, December 7th. Mr. R. Pearsall Smith was voted to the\nchair. There were also present : Col. Hartley, Dr. A. W. Barrett,\nDr. W. Leaf, and Messrs. F. W. H. Myers, F. Podmore, S. C. Scott,\nand H. A. Smith.\nThe Minutes of the previous Meeting were read and signed as\ncorrect. Seventeen new Associates were elected. The election of\nnine new Associates of the American Branch was recorded. Names\nand addresses are given above.\nIt was agreed that at the end of the year the name of the\nRev. C. A. Goodhart should, at his request, be transferred from the\nlist of Members to that of Associates. The resignation of twelve\nAssociates, who from various causes desired to terminate their\nconnection with the Society at the ond of the year, was accepted.\nIt was agreed to strike off the list the names of two Members\nand twelve Associates, who had either removed and been lost sight of,\nor who had become only nominal Members.\nA present to the Library was acknowledged with thanks.\nDr. A. W. Barrett gave a report of the work in which the\nHypnotic Committee had been engaged during the past few months,\nand which they hoped to continue.\nArrangements were made for the Annual Meeting of Members to\nbe held on Friday, January 25th, 1895, at 3 p.m. The names of\nthe retiring Members of Council were read over, and the Assistant\nSecretary was directed to send out all necessary notices.\nIt was agreed that General Meetings should be held on January\n25th, at 4 p.m. ; 0n March 1st, at 8.30 p.m. ; on April 5th, at 4 p.m. ;\nand on May 17th, at 8.30 p.m.\nThe next Meeting of the Council was fixed to take place at\nthe close of the Annual Business Meeting, on January 25th.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 69th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall, on Friday, December 7th, 1894, at 8.30 p.m.,\nMr. W. Leaf in the chair.\nMissX. read \" A Provisional Account of an Enquiry into Second-\nSight in the Highlands,\" of which the following is an abstract. She\nbegan by insisting upon the point that any report must be, at the\npresent stage, provisional only. Direct evidence of ^ny kind was\n\fJAN., 1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 3\ndifficult to obtain, though mere superficial and second-hand traditions\n\u2022were plentiful enough. Not only on account of their native reticence,\nbut because among the seers themselves the faculty of Second Sight is\nregarded with secret reverence and awe, first-hand testimony can be\nobtained only by living among the people and cultivating personal\nrelations with them. This Miss X., accompanied by a friend, tried to\n<lo during some weeks of the past autumn, both among the islands of\nthe Hebrides and in some of the more retired glens of the mainland.\nThe liberality of the Marquis of Bute has enabled the Society for\nPsychical Research to institute some formal enquiries in Scotland upon\nthe subject of Second Sight, extending over a period of some eighteen\nmonths preceding Miss X.'s visit, and which have served at least to\nindicate the difficulty of the enquiry, and the reluctance of the High\nlanders to commit themselves upon the question.\nThe Rev. Peter Dewar, of Rothesay, kindly undertook the office of\nhon. secretary, and sent out nearly 2,000 schedules to representatives\nof all classes in the Gaelic-speaking districts of the Highlands. Sixty\nonly were returned duly filled up ; and but half of these answered in\nthe affirmative the question :\n\"Is Second Sight believed in by the people in your neighbour\nhood?\"\nAt the end of six months, Lord Bute issued a further circular in\nhis own name, with somewhat better results, 210 forms being filled up,\nof which sixty-four answers were more or less affirmative.\nMiss X. observed that her experience tended to show that in a great\nnumber of instances the circulars had been neglected, not from\nindifference or lack of attention, but because many recipients felt that\na subject, which if not a motive force in their own lives, was at least a\ntradition reverently received from their ancestors, was one too great\nfor their powers of handling, too sacred for discussion with strangers.\nMiss X. believes that she has received at first hand something less\nthan 100 cases, and this, in spite of the kindest assistance from Mr.\nDewar, Mr. Crump, of Fort Augustus, many parish doctors, and the\nclergy, including the Roman and Anglican, in almost every parish to\nwhich her enquiries extended.\nThis, she feels, is very insufficient material upon which to base any\nsort of conclusion ; she can at present merely indicate the direction in\nwhich the enquiry, which she hopes to carry further, seems likely to\npoint.\n(1) The evidence of the Seers themselves seems to point to the\ntheory that \" Second Sight \" is, in many cases, a sort of extension or\n\u2022exaltation of the normal faculties, the \" prophecies \" being in many\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1895.\ninstances closely analogous to the cases of crystal vision, automatic\nwriting, and other forms of externalising an idea, which may be due to\nmemory or the unconscious observation of such signs as might\neasily escape the notice of the more occupied ordinary consciousness.\n(2) Though such a faculty is quite unrecognised by the Seers\nthemselves, there seems little doubt that Thought Transference plays\nan important part in the experiences they relate.\n(3) Careful enquiry into their habits of thought showed the\nHighland Seers, whom Miss X. had an opportunity of questioning\n(some twenty, at least), to be strong visualisers ; this, in relation not\nonly to their visions, but to their ordinary mental habits.\n(4) In many stories, the same feature recurred\u2014namely, the\nvision of a bright light (usually in connection with some incident in\nthe story) followed by unconscious deportation of the Seer\u2014suggesting\na conceivable clue in the possibility of self-hypnotisation and change of\nplace while unconscious of surroundings.\n(5) Miss X. failed to find any indication of belief that the visions\nare due to the agency of the Departed ; and the suggestion of Spirit\nReturn was invariably rejected with strong expressions of dislike.\nThe very few whose experiences suggested active external agency\nattributed such agency to \" the Devil.\"\n(6) Miss X. found traces of certain methods of divination, or\nautomatism, mixed with possible remains of forms of evocation, such\nas gazing into liquids carefully compounded, \" getting news \" from\nthe sea at certain stages of the moon, and the like. She also received\ncertain formulae for the acquisition of Second Sight ; but in no case\ndid the people themselves seem to attach much importance to methods\nof any kind.\n(7) On the contrary, they reject experiment, and believe that the\ngift is hereditary and spontaneous in its exercise, as indeed, among\nthem appears to be the case.\nMiss X. concluded by pointing out that the main interest in such\nindications lay in the fact that they were gathered among people of\nthe very simplest and most unconventional kind, who, nevertheless,\neven in the wildest spots, had attained a degree of culture and of\nactual book learning far surpassing that of the corresponding, even of\nmany higher classes, in England. She found them in every instance\ncapable of discussing the phenomena with the utmost intelligence,\nhandling the subject with faith rather than with superstition, anxious\nfor enlightenment as to its mysteries, for the most part free from\ndogmatism, and universally courteous, logical and reverent.\nDB. WALLACE said that he had received some closely analogous\n\fJAN., 1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 5\nevidence through a Scotch seeress, which he hoped in due time to be\nable to lay before the Society.\nA paper by Miss N. ROBERTSON on \" Experiments in Apparent\nClairvoyance\" was then read by Mr. F. W. H. Myers. The writer had\ntried over 15,000 experiments in guessing playing cards drawn from a\npack at hazard and not looked at by anyone, and the number of\nsuccesses she obtained was more than double what chance might have\nbeen expected to produce. Her impressions as to what the card was\ncame to her sometimes in the form of visual illusions or hallucinations ;\nsometimes it appeared to her as if an internal voice\u2014the voice of her\nown thoughts\u2014-told her the name of the card. Her first plan was to\ndraw a card out of a pack, keeping it face downwards on the table\nunder the palm of her hand, and she always recorded her guess before\nlooking at the card. About half the guesses were made in this way.\nIn other experiments, a pack of cards was placed on the table, and\nMiss Robertson noted in a book that she would guess (say) the 13th\ncard from the top of the pack ; then, after recording her guess, she\ncounted down the pack to the 13th card and recorded it. Some of\nthe series of experiments were failures,\u2014the number of successes not\nbeing more than might have been produced by chance, or even falling\nbelow this. Thus, some experiments in which each card was wrapped\nin tinfoil inside two envelopes failed ; also some in which the cards\nwere enclosed in locked boxes, and some in which Miss Robertson\nattempted to guess in the presence of other persons.\nFinally, however, she had some success with the cards in locked\nboxes ; and also when a friend of hers, Miss M., kept the pack and\ndrew cards from it, without looking at them. The most successful\nseries of all was one in which Miss M. sat in another room and\ndrew cards from the pack there.\nMiss Robertson also described some experiments in thought-\ntransference, which she had carried on with Miss M. as agent, and\nreferred to some successful experiments in clairvoyance of the same\nkind as her own made by another friend of hers.\nME. F. W. H. MYERS said that another member of the Society had\nhad similar success in divining cards ; and he hoped that a record of\nthese experiments also might soon be presented to the Society. A case\nof similar powers was described by Mr. W. H. Hudson, in his\ninteresting book, Idle Days in Patagonia. The possessor of this gift,\na Patagonian innkeeper, regarded it in a practical rather than a\nscientific light. By exercising it on what he deemed suitable\noccasions, he was able to dispense with other efforts to secure a\nmaintenance.\n\f6 Jourrtal of Society for Psychical Research. [.JAN., 1895.\nMR. LEAF, in returning thanks to the authors of the papers which\nhad been read, spoke of the difficulties which he anticipated in raising\nthe evidence for second sight to such a level as was required by the\nSociety. Not the least of these difficulties, in his opinion, would be\nthe entire neglect of dates, which he expected would be found so\nsoon as the endeavour was made to get accurate details. In enquiries\nwhich had been made in Brittany, a well-known home of \" second\nsight,\" this difficulty had proved insuperable.\nOBITUARY.\nROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\nThe sudden death of Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson, on December 3rd,\nat his Samoan home, has deprived the muster-roll of our society, as it\nhas deprived the civilised world itself, of one of its most brilliant names.\nWe cannot here survey the whole field of Mr. Stevenson's achieve\nments. We must speak only of the actual link which interested him\nin our studies, and made his own literary history of such special value\nto the psychologist. He offered one of the most striking examples on\nrecord of the habitual uprush and incursion into ordinary consciousness\nof ideas or pictures conceived and matured in some subconscious region,\nwithout sense of effort or choice or will. His essay on Dreams (in the\nvolume entitled Across the Plains), which recounts the assistance\nrendered to him by those subterranean workers whose story-telling\ninventiveness never failed him at need, is surely a psychological\ndocument worthy to set beside Coleridge's account of the dream-origin\nof Kubla Khan. Jekyll and Hyde was itself a dream-inspiration ;\nalthough here, as always, the self above the threshold co-operated\nskilfully and conscientiously with the self below ; and he had still\nproposed to himself, if leisure came, to remodel some points in that\nappalling romance into closer accordance with observed psychological\nfact.\nTo those who believe that the subliminal uprush is of the very\nessence of \" genius,\" and that the further evolution of man must con\nsist largely in his gaining a completer control over innate but latent\nfaculty, the account of Mr. Stevenson's readily evocable and unfail\ningly helpful dreams comes at once as a scientific corroboration and\nas a stimulating hope. Here once more the spectrum of consciousness\nhas been extended, the barrier between phases of personality over-\nstept ; and this new form of inspiration reveals the Subliminal Self as\nwilling to help the greacest story-teller of our day, with the same\n\fJAN., 1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 7\nobedience with which it has helped in other days the greatest of\nmathematicians, or of poets, or of saints.\nHomo est ; humani nihil alienum a se putat.\nAs it were from the stars beneath our feet and from the soul\nbeyond our knowledge, the exiled, the unique voice came. It was well\ndone of that simple people to clear a pathway through the untravelled\nforest, and bear his body upwards to where \"lightnings are loosened\"\non Pala's crown. We may conceive him gazing thence as the Genius\nof the Southern Hemisphere ; which over all the immensity of its isle-\nstarred deep has never felt the moving presence of any spirit like his\nown. F. W. H. M.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nL. 979. Ad P\" Apparition.\nIn this case, the triple form of the apparition is a curious feature,\nand one which it would be difficult to explain by a mistake of identity.\nMr. R. W. Raper, through whom the case reached us, writes to Mr.\nMyers :\u2014\nTrinity College, Oxford, May 5th, 1892.\nThe enclosed narrative was written down at my request. I heard it from\nthe lips of the narrator, very soon after the event occurred last Christmas\nvacation. He has put the tale on paper for me, almost exactly as he told it\nme first. I know him well, and can guarantee his perfect good faith.\nThe account enclosed was as follows :\u2014\nNew College, Oxford.\nJust before lastChristmasI went over to Liverpool with one of my brothers\nand my sister. It was a very fine, clear day, and there was a great crowd of\npeople shopping in the streets. We were walking down Lord-street, one of\nthe principal streets, when, passing me,I saw an old uncle of mine whom I knew\nvery little, and had not seen for a very long time, although he lived near me.\nI saw three distinct shapes hobbling past (he was lame) one after the other\nin a line. It didn't seem to strike me at the moment as being in the least\ncurious, not even there being three shapes in a line. I said to my sister,\n\" I have just seen Uncle E., and I am sure he is dead.\" I said this as it\nwere mechanically, and not feeling at all impressed. Of course my brother\nand sister laughed. We thought nothing more about it while in Liverpool.\nThe first thing my mother said to us on getting home was, \" I have some\nnews\" ; then she told us that this uncle had died very early that morning.\nI don't know the particular hour. 1 saw the three shapes at about 12 in the\nmorning. I felt perfectly fit and well, and was not thinking of my uncle in\nthe least, nor did I know he was ill. Both my brother and my sister heard\nme say that I had seen him, and believed he was dead, and they were equally\nastonished at hearing of his death on our return home. My uncle and I\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research- [JAN., 1895.\nknew each other very little. In fact, he hardly knew me by sight, although\nhe knew me well when I was a small child.\nJ. DOVE.\nIn reply to our request for corroborative evidence, Mr. Dove\nwrites :\u2014\nMay 20ft [1892].\nI enclose letters from my mother and my sister. Apparently my uncle\nhad died in his sleep in the early morning, as he was found dead in the\nmorning. I believe he was not ill before. I am afraid I can't remember\nthe date of our excursion to Liverpool, but believe it to have been about\ntwo or three days before Christmas.\nThe following are the letters enclosed :\u2014\n(1) From Mrs. Dove.\n21, Devonshire Place, Claughton, Birkenhead, May 15th, 1892.\nI am sorry I have not been able to find out any particulars about Uncle\nEdwards' death. I sent the letter you enclosed with yours for Granny to\nread, so that she might be able to give me particulars ; but she says no one\nknows the hour of his death, for he was found dead in bed and had died in\nhis sleep. . . .\nA. G. DOVE.\n(2) From Miss Dove. May 17ft [1892].\nMother said you wanted me to write to you about the Uncle Edwards\nepisode. I do remember distinctly your saying to me in Liverpool, \" three\nmen have passed me exactly like Uncle E. : he must be dead ! \" and then\nwe heard afterwards that he had died that day, but I do not remember the\ndate.\nL. 980. Ad Pn Apparition.\nThe following case of an apparition seen shortly after death by a\nchild of five years old was sent to us by the Rev. J. A. Macdonald,\nwho writes in sending it :\u2014\n2, Quarry Bank, Heswall, Cheshire, May 11ft, 1894.\nThe accompanying case has the merit of recent occurrence. \"Little\nJack \" died from convulsions with teething. The Michells are proprietors\nof lead works at St. Helens, Lancashire.\nJ. A. MACDONALD.\nThe account is given by the child's mother. She writes :\u2014\nThe Hollies, St. Helens, Lancaster, May 8ft, 1894.\nOn the 25th of last month I was sitting in the nursery, and my little\ndaughter Gwendoline was playing with her dolls, and she suddenly laughed\nso as to attract my attention, and I asked her what she was laughing at.\nShe said, \" O mother, I thought I saw little Jack in that chair \"\u2014a vacant\nchair in the room\u2014and indicating her little cousin. About five minutes\nafter this the clerk telephoned from the office saying he had just received a\ntelegram from Penzance announcing the death of little Jack. It was about\nhalf-past nine in the morning when the incident occurred in the nursery at\n\fJAN., 1895.] Journal of Society for Pxychical Research. 9\nSt. Helens. The death in Penzance took place at about half-past seven on\nthe same morning.\nE. MICHELL.\nIn reply to our further inquiries, Mr. Michell wrote :\u2014\nMay 28th, 1894.\nGwendoline is five years and four months old.\nI am not aware that she has had any previous experience of the kind\nrelated to Mr. Macdonald, but that the one in question is a fact I have not\nthe slightest doubt.\nShe knows the clerk at our office, and he has often csnversed with her,\nand occasionally played with her in an ordinary way.\nThe impression she had was just prior to the clerk's telephoning my wife,\nand although the clerk did not think about my daughter missing Jack at all,\nyet Mrs. Michell herself was anxiously wondering what the news respecting\nJack would be.\nThere was no one else in the nursery besides my wife and daughter, but\nMrs. Michell was very deeply impressed with the matter, and then to receive\nthe message very shortly after forced the matter upon her mind still deeper,\nand she told me immediately I arrived home.\nJAS. J. MICHELL.\nG. 247. Collective Unrecognised Auditory.\nThe following case of a collective auditory hallucination was\nreceived through the Rev. W. S. Grignon. We are not permitted to\nprint the names of the percipients.\nOne of them, Mr. W., writes :\u2014\nAugust 6th, 1893.\nOn the 1st November, 1892, soon after 11 a. m. , while seated with Mr.\nS , in the office room of his house at \u2014\u2022\u2014-, Poona, 1 distinctly heard a\nvoice with which I was quite unacquainted call out in sharp clear tones,\n\"Mrs. H ! Mrs. H !\" (my sister-in-law, who was lost in the\n\" Roumania \" a few days previously). The voice seemed to be that of\nsomeone calling from above to my sister-in-law down stairs.\nMy age was 36, and at the time I was in good health, though in grief\nand anxiety about the loss of my sister-in-law ; [I] was discussing an official\nreport of mine, which Mr. S , who is the head of my Department,\nwas reading out.\nMr. S\u2014\u2022\u2014 distinctly heard the same voice, and we both started up and\nwent outside into the verandah and all over the house, but there was no\none about except the peons, who declared no one had called out. The ladies\nof the house were in one of the back bedrooms, but they had neither heard\nthe voice, nor had they been calling out.\nI have never had an experience of this kind before.\nMr. S. writes :\u2014\nPoona, August 6th, 1893.\nMr. W 's statement is absolutely true. I heard the voice, clear and\ndistinct, call out, \"Mrs. H .\"twice. It was a voice not belonging to\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1805.\nmy household, and a strange voice,\u2014the voice of a woman alarmed ; and it\nsounded as if on board ship calling down a skylight. I say this in perfect\nfaith, as I began life as a sailor, and served seven years in the Indian Navy,\nand have had personal experience of the peculiar sound of voices calling\ndown hatchways and skylights on board ship at sea. The voice was so real,\nand the name so distinctly uttered, that Mr. W and 1 left the table at\nwhich we were seated and ran outside into the verandah of the bungalow in\nthe endeavour, on the spur of the moment, and oil natural impulse, to dis\ncover the owner of the voice ; but there was no one at all near, within\nspeaking or calling distance. Two peons, or native messengers, who were\nin the verandah, informed us that no European had been near, and these\npeons knew no English.\nL. 981. Thought-transference.\nThe following cases are given by Miss Emma Foy, of 42,\nCarlton Eoad, Manor Park, Essex, who has had a large number of\nexperiences of an apparently telepathic \u2014or in some instances, as she\nbelieves, premonitory\u2014kind. The first case, which reached us through\nMr. C. J. Prest, of 149, Norwood Road, Herne Hill, is an interesting\ninstance of an obviously subjective hallucination being transferred to\nother percipients.\nMiss Foy writes : \u2014\nMarch Wth, 1892.\nTowards the end of year 1872, saw tall human skeleton enter bedroom,\ndragging a coffin which it brought close to me. Over its right arm was a pall.\nThen pointing to the coffin, it threw the pall over me, causing a feeling of\nsuffocation which left me very weak. Continued its visits almost every night\nabout 10.30, for the space of about two years, then gradually disappeared.\nTried in many ways to dispel the illusion ; did not believe in supernatural\noccurrences ; have always been of lively disposition ; excellent spirits which\nnothing seemed to affect ; never saw a real skeleton ; nor up to that time\nany representation of one ; nor had any dread ofdeath.\n[When I saw it, I was] preparing to go to bed. As far as I was able to\njudge, was not out of health at the commencement of the visitations, nor\nin grief or anxiety. Aged 20.\nI have wondered since whether I should have seen anyone had I\nlooked in the coffin when the apparition pointed to it, the coffin giving me\nthe impression that it was not a new one, nor the rope attached to it ; but I\nhad not the courage to look in. The room was lighted on every occasion;,\n[I] never saw it in the dark.\nThe phantom appeared again suddenly in August 1879, either the last\nweek in August or first in September. This time there were eight persons\npresent. Two persons saw the vision besides myself\u2014a poor woman and an\neducated gentleman, the gentleman being thrown into a very nervous state\nfor some time after and experiencing similar sensations to myself. Was out\nof health this time. Time 9.30 p.m.\nEMMA FOY.\n\fJAN., 1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 11\nIt has unfortunately been impossible to obtain corroborative\nevidence of this incident, which occurred in a hospital,\u2014the other per\ncipients being one of the patients, who could not now be traced, and a\nmedical man, to whom Miss Foy did not like to mention the subject.\nThe supposition of his having shared the hallucination, in fact, rests\nmerely on the terror he manifested at the time.\nMrs. Sidgwick called on Miss Foy and heard from her a full account\nof this and other experiences. She gives the following account of her\ninterview :\u2014\nApril llth, 1892.\nI saw Miss Foy on Thursday, April 7th, and thought her one of the best\nwitnesses I have met\u2014very sensible, quiet, and scientific in her attitude of\nmind\u2014taking pains apparently to make out what the other people concerned\nsaw or felt, without putting leading questions. But she did not make notes at\nthe time. She told me a number of experiences,\u2014some six or eight cases of\nwhat seemed to be thought-transference between her and different people,\nchiefly children in her charge\u2014she being always the agent,\u2014also about the\nsame number of premonitory dreams and impressions.\nAs regards the skeleton, the last time she saw it she was in a hospital,\nand it appeared at the window of the nurses' dressing-room, opposite her bed.\nShe did not this time see the coffin. She turned and talked to the woman in\nthe next bed\u2014a Mrs. C.\u2014and presently she (Mrs. C.) looked towards the\nwindow and exclaimed. Miss Foy pretended she saw nothing, and asked\nwhat Mrs. C. saw. She said, ''That thing all bones.\" Miss Foy got up\nand went to the window to prove to Mrs. C. that there was nothing there,\nand the latter said the thing seemed to go further away as Miss Foy ap\nproached it. This was her own impression, too. Dr. came up soon\nafterwards, and presently, following the direction of the two women's eyes,\nwas started and agitated, and soon left the ward. About an hour later the\nnurse came in laughing about Dr. being so nervous ; he wanted her to\ngo with him into the dissecting-room, where was lying dead. He said\nhe had been so nervous ever since he was in the ward an hour before. This\nis all that is known about his experience, as he was never spoken to about\nit. Miss Foy believes he has gone to India.\nOn the skeleton's previous visits, the throwing over her of the pall seemed\nto bring on a kind of unconsciousness, and when she awoke from this, all was\ngone, and she got into bed. I understood that apart from this sort of fit,\nor whatever it was, she was during this time quite well.\nLately her sister has seen a skull more than once, and believed the\nhallucination to be due to Miss Foy having a return of her skeleton. It\ndoes appear to have coincided with Miss Foy's mind dwelling on a skull\nd propos to the ancient Egyptian mode of embalming.\nIn July, 1892, Miss Foy sent Mi's. Sidgwick a narrative of her\nexperiences, some extracts from which are printed below. The\nincidents, as will be seen, are mostly trivial, and from the circum\nstances are such as it would be difficult to obtain confirmation of, but\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1895.\nthe accumulation of coincidences seems to us beyond what could\nreasonably be attributed to chance, and they appear to have been\ncarefully and candidly recorded.\nThe unprinted part of the narrative relates to dreams, which\nseemed to Miss Foy to correspond in a remarkable manner with\nevents in her life taking place shortly afterwards, and these impressed\nher much more than her telepathic experiences. Several of the dreams\noccurred when she was looking out for new posts as a private\ngoverness, and in each of them she saw unknown places and persons,\nwhich afterwards seemed to her to resemble those that she made\nacquaintance with in her next situation.\nNo. 1.\nIn January, 1883, [one of my pupils] a little girl, Mary W., was ill of\nmeasles, but very slightly so. I was in an adjoining room reading the\nGraphic. I turned to the advertisements, among which was a testimonial\nby Erasmus Wilson to the efficacy of Pears' Soap. The little girl rang a\nhand bell just as I had read the two last words of the advertisement, viz. :\nPears' Soap. I went to see what she wanted, and after looking at her for\na minute, she turned her eyes to the wall in front, and exclaimed suddenly,\n\"Oh! look there. There are letters coming out of the wall.\" I declared it was\nall nonsense ; but as she persisted in her statement, I asked her to tell me\nwhat letters she saw, when she spelt, \" P-e-a-r-s S-o\u2014.\" Here she stopped.\nI was startled, knowing that I had just looked at those two last words in the\nadvertisement. I ran back to see if it were really so, and I found that\nit was so.\nThis advertisement was not one of those advertisements containing an\noptical illusion, which are so frequently sent round by Messrs. Pears, but\nan ordinary black letter advertisement, such as appears in any daily paper.\nNo. 2.\nWhile living in [another] family, I was sitting quietly in an upstairs\nroom, thinking about a sermon I had heard the night before. A young girl,\nbetween 10 and 11 years of age, was watching me unknown to myself. All\nat once she said to me, \"Miss Foy, I know what you are thinking about.\"\nI asked her to tell me. She at once said, \"About your church.\" I replied,\n\" Well, as you are so clever, perhaps you can tell me what the text was last\nnight.\" I only said this in fun, not thinking the child could, but to my\nsurprise she said almost the next instant, \" God is love.\" This was\nreally the text, but I, thinking it might after all only be a guess on\nher part, would not admit it directly, but told her to think of some other,\nbut she said it was the only one that kept coming into her thoughts.\nShe also added, \"It must be right, for I can see it in front of your eyes,\nbetween yours and mine.\"\nAs far as this little girl was concerned, I frequently found her interpreting\nmy thoughts.\nNo. 3.\nI was giving lessons on one occasion to three little children. One of\n\fJAN., 1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 13\nthem, a little girl named Daisy, aged 7, was working a sum. It was the\ncustom in this family for each member of the household to repeat a text at\nmorning prayers. I intended saying the following morning this one, \" Lord\nhelp me,\" but forgetting where this text was, I was thinking very hard where\nit could be, when I saw Daisy look at me, and the next instant she stopped\nworking the sum and I saw her writing something in the corner of her\nslate. Shortly afterwards she gave me her slate to examine the sum, and\nthen I saw she had written the text as above on her slate. I asked the child\nwhat made her do it, but she seemed unconscious that she had written it and\nscarcely believed that she had really done so till I shewed her her own writ\ning. I asked her if she had been thinking of the text at all, but she replied\nthat she did not know that there was suoh a text, and she could give me no\nreason whatever for writing it.\nNo. 4.\nI had another curious experience with regard to this same little girl some\ntime after. A friend lent me a book, The Life of Fletcher of Madely, a\nclergyman of the Church of England. I took care to keep this book out of\nthe way of the children, because my friend prized it, but having on this occa\nsion read the closing scene of Mr. Fletcher's life just before going to bed, I\nwas surprised in the morning to hear the following statement from Daisy\nShe said to me, \" Miss Foy, I have had a strange dream.\" I said laughingly,\n\"Have you? I suppose it was about an elephant, lion or tiger \"(she was\nfond of reading natural history). She said, \" Don't laugh, because it was a\nbeautiful dream, and not laughable.\" She then said she dreamt about a\nclergyman ; he wore a black gown ; that he came to the library and\nlooked at me (meaning myself) ; that he died ; that he had such a nice face.\nThe child added, \" He went to Heaven, and I should like to have gone with\nhim, he looked so beautiful, but I woke up.\"\nI was thinking, as a matter of course, about this clergyman, seeing that I\nhad read the last scene of his life just before going to bed. In the book he\nis described as having a beautiful face, and as far as I remember Mr. Fletcher\nwas preaching when he was taken ill and was carried (I believe) from the\npulpit to his bed, from which he never rose. I did not talk about this book\nto the child or anyone in the house, and, even if I had, should certainly not\nhave said anything about the death of the clergyman to such a little child,\nbesides, she was fast asleep when I was finishing the book. Mr. F. would\nin all probability have worn a black gown. It is very doubtful if ever the\nchild saw any clergyman in his surplice, either black or white, as her parents\nwere Nonconformists. Then as to the library where the child said he came,\nI may say that it was in the library that I was reading the book. I am\nquite certain the child never read any part of the book .\nNo. 5.\nThe father of this little girl one Sunday related what appeared to him a\ncurious incident which he could not account for. He told two gentlemen, who\nwere dining with us on that occasion, that after we had all gone to church he\nseemed to hear someone saying to him : \"fto up to the nursery.\" He took\nno notice, as he believed it to be only his imagination playing him a trick,\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1895.\nbut as he was repeatedly urged to go up to the nursery, and was unable to\ncontinue reading his book through it, he at last went up, and saw at\nonce why he was told to go. Two out of three pet canaries had escaped\nfrom their cages, and were standing on the frame of the window, both\nsashes being pushed quite down, it being a very hot day. Mr. F. caught\nthem, but said to his friends that he was only just in time. He further said\nit perplexed him to find a reason for his being told in what he considered a\npeculiar way. What was it ? His friends could not explain, but I felt that\nI could, but did not like. It seemed that 1 must have been the cause. It\nwas my duty to see that the doors of the cages were properly fastened after\nthe children cleaned and fed their pets. I was as a rule particular about\nthis, but on this occasion I forgot, and when half way on my road to church\nwondered whether the doors were really fastened\u2014was anxious about it\u2014\nbut remembering Mr. F. was at home, as he had a bad headache, I hoped he\nmight go up, and he did as I have stated above. This gentleman would\nnot be likely to think about the birds. He had nothing to do with them,\nand seldom noticed them ; but I was very fond of them, and frequently\nthought about them. They were allowed to fly about the room for an hour\nor two every day and would perch on my head and shoulder and go to\nsleep.\nNo. 6.\nIt was the custom of this family to require (as I have before mentioned)\neach member of the household to repeat a text at morning prayers, the\ngentleman commencing. I frequently found, however, that he either chose\nthe same text as I had, or else one that referred to the same subject. It occurred\nso often that it was rather annoying, as it made me somewhat confused,\nand I could not always on the spur of the moment choose another. I thought\nit quite possible that the gentleman influenced me, as he went to his text-book\nin the library within a few minutes of my going into my room to choose mine.\nI therefore tried the experiment of choosing my text as soon as I got up,\nbut found mntters just the same. I then tried another way, and chose my\ntext a day beforehand, but it was of no use, things happened just the same.\nNo. 7.\nAbout the third week in March,1892, I was on Sunday evening, between\n6.30 and 6.45, singing some old hymns in the house where I am now living.\nI thought of one in particular called \"The Pilgrims of the Night,\" and\nwished someone in the house would sing or play it that evening. At 8.30\nMrs. M. came in, and in a few minutes sat down at the piano and played the\nabove hymn. I had in the meantime written dovm my wish and the time. Soon\nafter I went downstairs and asked her if she had been thinking of it at all.\nShe replied that she had not till coming in from church, and that it was\nabout six years since she had heard or played it herself.\nNo. 8.\nAbout April, 1890, while living in [a] family at Hammersmith, I was\nasked if I would mind taking a dinner to a poor old woman who had seen\nbetter days, as we sometimes say. I took it and entered into conversation\nwith her. She told me her circumstances, and I wished that someone would\n\fJAN., 1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 15\ngive her help. Suddenly it occurred to me that Annie D , a servant\nliving in the same house as myself, was in the habit of visiting her on Sun\nday afternoon and enjoying her conversation, but she was also very close\nwith her money, and as she enjoyed the old woman's conversation, and\nsometimes a cup of tea at her expense, I thought she might have rewarded\n[her] in some little way which would not hurt her feelings, and I wished I\ncould influence her to do so anonymously. A week later something pre\nvented the housemaid from taking the old lady's Sunday dinner again, so\nMrs. F , the mistress, asked me if I would. The old lady said that dur\ning the week a thing had happened to her which had greatly surprised her,\nand which had never happened before. She had received an anonymous\nletter containing stamps, and was very thankful to myself for sending it. I\ntold her that 1 had not sent it, but she said, \" It is very strange then, for\nalthough I have only seen you twice, yet every time I try to think who could\nhave sent it, something says 'Mrs. F 's governess,' and so, of course, I\ncan't help thinking you are the person. \" Then I wished to see, when I re\nturned, if Annie D had really sent it. So upon telling her what the old\nlady had received, she blushed, and said, \"Don't tell\u2014I sent it in that way\nbecause she is poor but proud, and I thought it would not hurt her feelings.\nSomething made me do it.\"\nNo. 9.\nIt was in March (I think) of the present year that I filled up a paper\nrespecting an apparition which had troubled me almost nightly for about\ntwo years, and afterwards returned suddenly about five years later, and was\nthen seen by two other persons, one a doctor, the other a poor woman.\nThe apparition was a skeleton, &c. The particulars are fully described\nin the paper sent to Mrs. Sidgwick. I was talking about this expe\nrience to members of the family I am living in, principally the doctor,\nhis wife, and Mr. Prest, who collects information for the Society. Con\nversations took place respecting it for several days in succession. I after\nwards went home for a holiday. I was surprised to hear the following from\nmy sister. She said that six nights in succession she had seen a skeleton's\nhead upon the wall, I think about 11 p.m. : it remained for hours, and that\ndirectly it appeared I also came into her thoughts. She was not at all\nfrightened and altered the curtains and did many things in the room to get\nrid of it. Finding it useless and as I was in her thoughts on each occasion\nand during the time it remained, she connected it with myself, and said to\nmy mother who was sleeping with her, \" You may depend upon it that Emma\n{myself) has been troubled with that skeleton again, but I cannot understand\nwhy I should see it too. \" I then told my sister that I had filled up a paper\nrespecting it and as I had been talking about it several days in succession, I\nmust have caused her to see it too.\nDONATION.\nWe have to acknowledge gratefully the receipt by the Treasurer\nof a donation of \u00a3200 in aid of the work of the Society from Mrs.\nMyers (Senior) of Brandon House, Cheltenham.\n\f16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1895.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nAPPARENT DUALITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS UNDER ANAESTHETICS.\nThe following account of experiences under the influence of nitrous\noxide gas is somewhat similar to a case given in the Journal for\nJuly, 1894. The impressions do not seem to have at all resembled\nthose described by Professor W. Ramsay, in his paper on Partial\nAnaesthesia, in the Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXV., Vol IX., p. 236.\nAbout August, 1893, I had \" laughing gas \" during the extraction of two\nteeth, and observed the following :\u2014\nThe dentist told me that when I heard the notes of a musical-box I\nshould know I had \"come to.\" The doctor said I should not hear him\ncount \"twelve.\" The same had been told me about three weeks before. I\nhad on that occasion heard \" seven,\" and knew no more till I heard the\nmusical-box. On this occasion I tried to keep consciousness of the\ninterval.\nAt \" two \" the gas was turned on. At \" six \" I was conscious, but aware\nthat I could no longer stop the operation. I heard \" seven \" and \" eight,'' and\nthen the conversation between the two gentlemen became so absorbing that\nI forgot to listen to the counting. They were discussing the question of my\nsensibility, and saying that they were only pretending to give me gas. The\nlast remark of the dentist was addressed to me, \" You see, it is entirely a\nquestion of faith.\" As I heard this, I also heard the musical-box, and one\npart of me knew that the teeth were out and the remark of the dentist\nimaginary, while the other part knew that the remark was real, and that\nnothing but conversation had occurred since I sat down. Another part of\nme, which I can only call I, waited to see which was the correct version.\nAlmost instantly the three united and I realized the situation.\nLast June I again had gas for the extraction of one tooth, under similar\ncircumstances. The doctor said I should not hear \" fifteen.\"\nAt \"two\" the gas was turned on. At \"seven\" I was aware that I\ncould not move much, but was still so conscious that I lifted my hand (with\ngreat difficulty) to show that I still felt. I heard \" eight, nine,\" and instead\nof \" ten,\" at what seemed just the proper interval, I heard the doctor speak\nabout the extracted tooth to the dentist. At the same time I knew that\nsomeone else, very closely connected with me, had gone through a long ex\nperience since hearing the word \" nine.\" Then I felt that these two \" some\nbodies \" were amalgamating, and as they united I heard the musical-box ;\nbut there was a further interval before I was able to move. The dentist was\nurging me to sit up ; but I made no effort, as I felt that I was not quite sure\nthat I was complete enough to move. I was not certain that the person who\nheard the order to move was able to convey the order to the person who had\nto move. It was only when I actually sat up that I was sure that \"I\nwas I.\"\nM.

The total number of members of all classes was 914 on\nJanuary 1st, 1895, as against 877 the year before. In the American\nBranch there had, however, been a slight decline, from 521 to 503.\nAn audited statement of the receipts and expenditure of the\nSociety during 1894 was presented to the meeting. It appears as\nusual in the Journal. The auditor reported that the accounts had\nbeen kept with the usual care. Speaking of the finances of the\nSociety, the Chairman briefly noted the position of stability and\nsecurity in which they had been placed through the legacy of \u00a32,700\nleft to the Society by the late Dr. A. T. Myers. They were now per\nmanently relieved from any necessity of taking account of the value\nof the Library, the stock of Proceedings, or the furniture, in order to\nshow a balance of assets over liabilities. Speaking of the American\nBranch, Professor Sidgwick referred to the great time of depression\nwhich the United States had been passing through, the effects of\nwhich had been severely felt by the Branch of the S.P.R., in common\nwith the rest of American society. It might be hoped, however, that\nthis depression was only temporary. The Council had unanimously\napproved, with the consent of the Trustees, of an advance being made\nto the Branch from the funds placed at the disposal of the Society by\nDr. Myers' legacy, and by a donation of \u00a3200 from Mrs. Myers (senior).\nThis item would be found in the statement of Accounts.\nAs those present would be aware, the Second-Sight Enquiry had\nbeen prosecuted during the year, and was still proceeding. \u00a346 of the\nFund provided by the liberality of the Marquis of Bute remained in\nhand.\n\f1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 19\nReferring to the two next items on the agenda, \" Proposed\nalterations in Rules \" and \" Proposed Incorporation of the Society,\"\nthe Chairman said that, as all members had received notice of the\nproposed alterations in the rules, most of which were of a trivial\ncharacter, it was unnecessary for him to go through them. Some later\nsuggestions had, however, been received. He would ask Mr. H. Arthur\nSmith to put the whole question before the meeting.\nMR. H. A. SMITH explained the reasons which had led to the pro\nposal for the incorporation of the Society. It was a step which had\nrecently been taken by a large number of scientific bodies, and had\n\u2022various practical business advantages, while it would in no way affect\nthe actual working of the Society, nor would it either diminish the\nprivileges or increase the responsibilities of the members. In view of\nthe proposal it was desirable that a number of small changes should\nbe made in the rules, so that, in the event of incorporation being\nadopted, they could without further change become what would\ntechnically be \"The Articles of Association\" of the Society. Mr.\nSmith proposed some slight amendments to the rules as they had\nbeen sent round to members. After a full discussion, they were\nunanimously adopted as amended. They will be printed in the next\nvolume of the Proceedings.\nA further resolution in favour of the incorporation of the Society\nwas also unanimously carried.\nPROF. BARRETT remarked that thanks were due to Mr. H. Arthur\nSmith and to Mr. Sydney C. Scott for the work they had done in con\nnection with this matter, which would save the Society considerable\nexpense in carrying it out.\nProceeding to the annual election of a portion of the Council, the\nChairman said that, no further nominations having been made since\nthe usual notice had been sent round to members, he had only to declare\nthat Professor W. F. Barrett, Lieut.-Col. J. Hartley, Dr. Walter Leaf,\nProfessor Oliver J. Lodge, F.R.S., Mr. F. W. H. Myers, Lord Rayleigh,\nF.R.S., Mr. H. Babington Smith, Mr. R. Pearsall Smith, and Sir\nAugustus Stephenson, K.C.B., Q.C., were duly elected.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nThe Council met at the close of the Annual Business Meeting, and\nat four o'clock adjourned, meeting again at six o'clock. Professor\nSidgwick occupied the chair. There were also present at one or both\nsittings :\u2014Professor W. F. Barrett, Colonel Hartley, Sir Augustus\nK. Stephenson, Dr. J. Milne Bramwell, Dr. G. F. Rogers, and Messrs.\nIV. Crookes, F. W. H. Myers, F. Podmore, Sydney C. Scott,\nH. Arthur Smith, and R. Pearsall Smith.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as correct.\nReport was made that the Annual Business Meeting had been held,\n\u2022and Members of Council elected as stated above.\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

F. W. H. MYERS delivered an address on \" The Progression from\nSubliminal Phenomena to Phenomena claiming to be obtained under\nSpirit Control,\"\u2014of which the following is a brief rhum.6 :\u2014\nThe Society has lately been presented with accounts of various\nextraordinary phenomena, occurring in the presence of Mr. Stainton-\nMoses, or of Eusapia Paladino. It is. felt, I think, on many sides that\none of the gravest drawbacks to belief in such phenomena lies not in\ndefect of actual testimony to their occurrence, but in the incoherence\nand unintelligibility of the phenomena themselves. They cannot be\nfitted into any scheme of Nature, nor do they in themselves seem to\nhave any serious meaning, but rather to be purely grotesque and\nirrelevant. I believe that in reality the case is quite otherwise ; and\nthat these phenomena of the seance-room will be found on analysis to\nbe extensions of vital phenomena which we already know to occur\nunder subliminal control ;\u2014that is, under the control of that part of\n\u2022our own being whose operation lies below the threshold of our ordinary\nconsciousness.\nThus, if we consider the processes and products of ordinary physical\nnutrition, we recognise that out of an almost endless number of\npossible compounds, resulting from protoplasmic metabolism, com\nparatively few are actually produced, and those few as the result of\ncertain fairly uniform conditions or stimuli. But so soon as hypnotic\nsuggestion\u2014which in the last resort is self-suggestion\u2014begins to act,\nsecretions may be evoked by novel stimuli ;\u2014or say by a central impulse\nwhich dispenses with the local stimulus usually needed. Thus in\nstigmatisation the serum which ordinarily forms itself after local\nmechanical irritation now forms itself in direct obedience to a central\nidea. Push this process a step further, and assume an action upon the\n\u2022organism directed by fuller knowledge, and you may have new com\npounds formed in the body,\u2014a novel metastasis of secretion directed\nby an idea, just as it was an idea which directed the locality of the\nblisters formed in the stigmatises. Suppose then that a spirit desires\nso to use its power over a human organism as to produce a secretion\nunmistakeably novel and purposive, is it not possible that it will so\n\u2022combine the constituents of the body,\u2014in themselves adequate, if\nsuitably compounded, to the simulation of almost any of the familiar\nscents,\u2014as to produce a,fragrant secretion ? And if so, analogy shows\nthat the sudorific glands will be among the most easily affected. We\nshall have, then, a gradual approach to one of Mr. Moses' phenomena,\nwhich is at first sight among the most grotesque,\u2014namely, the well-\nattested fact of the stillation of \" liquid scent \" from a certain area\non his scalp.\nAgain, the unconsuming, arbitrarily generated, lights which are\nrecorded at seances, in themselves so inexplicable, are not without\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

It must suffice to say that\nin so far as these lights are truly phosphorescent, they may again\ninvolve an action exercised on the sudorific glands of the medium.\nPhosphorescent perspiration has not been infrequently observed in\nclinical practice, especially when much free phosphorus has been\ntaken as a medicine,\u2014and it is specially claimed by Mr. Moses' guides\nthat for the purpose of obtaining \" power \" they draw phosphorus-\nfrom the medium's body.\nAgain, consider the intimate control over matter claimed by spirits,\nand exhibited in arbitrary disequalisation of temperature, and other\nabrogations of ordinary thermal laws, and in aggregation and dis-\naggregation of matter, as when pearls fall from the air, an orange\npasses through a wall, etc. As was urged on a former occasion, these\nassumed powers are almost exactly identical with the powers of the\nso-called \" demons of Maxwell,\"\u2014imaginary entities conceived as,\nillustrating what could be effected by creatures who could deal with\nmolecules singly,\u2014as we might deal, say, with golf-balls, tennis balls,\ncricket-balls, which we could sort individually and arrange as we\npleased,\u2014instead of dealing with molecules only in the gross, and by\nprodigious multitudes at a time, which is all that we can actually do.\nIf in these physical, material phenomena anything like a progress\nor series can be observed, leading from the faculty manifested in\ncommon life, the faculty which the human organism or the human\nspirit shows under circumstances which call its own hidden powers into\nplay, onwards to the faculty manifested by er through the same organism\nwhen acted upon by the superior skill and knowledge of a spirit\nalready disembodied ;\u2014if, I say, there is any kind of continuous\nprogress discernible in this series of phenomena, concerned with\nphysical nutrition and physical expenditure, much more will such\ncontinuity be discernible when we approach the phenomena of mental\nnutrition and mental expenditure ;\u2014the reception of sense-impressions\nand the output of ideation, emotion, and will, which constitute the\nmental or subjective exchanges of the inner man. In this higher\nseries we find the sense-impressions habitually received by the supra-\nliminal self widening into the telepathic and clairvoyant impressions\nreceived by the subliminal self ;\u2014and when once any breath of\nknowledge from a transcendental world has thus entered the human\nspirit, there need be no violence in the assumption that that trans\ncendental world, with its appropriate denizens, may be more and more\nfully opened up to the perception of the still incarnate soul.\nSuch speculations as these must as yet be crude in the extreme \\\nbut they represent a line of inquiry which must inevitably be some\nday pursued to better profit, if there be any fragment of truth in the\nwhole range of spirit-guided phenomena. The slightest spirit-rap, if it\ntruly exists, will need volumes to explain it. For it cannot stand\nalone : it cannot be isolated from the phenomena which we already\nknow. If Nature is to be intelligible to our minds she must be con\ntinuous ; her action must be uniformitarian and not catastrophic ;\u2014\nor the catastrophes of the human spirit must only be such as those\n\fFKB., 1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 23\nwhich mark the passage of a material body from the solid to the\nliquid, or from the liquid to the gaseous state. Only when we can\nsee\u2014however dimly\u2014the whole range of material and psychical\nphenomena linked and in connection, shall we see even the simplest\nphenomenon aright. That ideal may be an unattainable one, but it\nmust be none the less our ideal.\nSome discussion followed, in the course of which\nMB. ST. GEORGE LANE Fox remonstrated against Mr. Myers' use of\nthe word \" spirit,\" as a word which, he thought, had acquired too many\nassociations with superstition and error to be suitably used in any dis-\nfussion which aimed at exactness. What was needed was some word\nconveying the idea of a centre of psychic action which was in some sense\ncontinuous under changing conditions, without, however, the idea of\nfixity and permanence ; \u2014some word corresponding to the \"five Shand-\nhas \" of Buddhist terminology, which implied aggregations of activities,\naffinities, or potencies, whether corporeal, psychical, or mental, which\nwent to make up our ideas of a separate entity.\nMR. MYERS agreed with Mr. Lane Fox in wishing that it were\npossible to find some term which would be freer from old associations\nthan the word \"spirit.\" He did not, however, himself venture to\npropose a new word. The Buddhistic terms suggested by Mr. Lane\nFox were in themselves ancient and respectable in the highest degree ;\nbut he (the speaker) fancied that he had seen them of late years in\nsomewhat questionable company.\nThe REV. J. PAGE HOPPS remarked on the interest of Mr. Moses'\ncommunications as insisting on the benefit of prayer, not only to the\nsupplicant, but also to the departed spirits themselves, who were\nrepresented as helped forward by the prayers of living men for their\nwelfare.\nIn reply to a question as to the degree in which Mr. Moses' guides\nrepresented prayer as efficacious for the supplicant's own benefit, MR.\nMYERS replied that the automatic writings asserted that elevated\nprayer was always beneficial in so far that it attracted influences of a\nhigh order round the supplicant, from whom, unconsciously to him\nself, he received moral benefit. Prayer for physical benefits (as the\nrelief of pain) could only, they said, be efficacious in the case of a\nmedium, whom it was possible for spirits to approach on a physical\nplane. <\nDR. A. WALLACE supported what had been said as to sudden\naccesses of hysterical strength, and added that he had met with some\ncases in hospital practice which led him to accept the possibility of\nprenatal suggestion.\nPROFESSOR W. F. BARRETT, in reference to Mr. Myers' remarks\non the possible emission of light by all living things, drew attention to\nthe fact that even in the most rudimentary forms of animal life the\norganic processes going on involved oxidation and disintegration,\nprotoplasmic changes which are necessarily accompanied by the evolu\ntion of heat. The greater the activity of this chemical change, which\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FSB., 1895.\nis constantly in process in all living protoplasm, the higher is the\ntemperature attained ; and as this difference of temperature between\nliving tissue and the surrounding medium extends not only to the\ninfusoria and to so-called oold-blooded animals, but also to plants\u2014\nmany of which, like the arum, are sensibly warm to the touch\u2014it\nfollows that all life, even the lowest, does emit radiation. The radi\nance of living things is not, as a rule, perceived by us, simply because\nthe normal human eye is unaffected by rays in the infra-red portion of\nthe spectrum, but it does not follow that to all eyes, under all condi-\nditions, this radiation is invisible. On the contrary, we should\nexpect that the collective visual power of the whole of animal life\nwould far transcend the range of vision of any single individual.\nFurthermore, the exaltation of special sense-perceptions, which is\nfound in certain individuals in their normal state and is excited in\nothers by hypnotism, would lead us to expect that in such the range of\nvision might, by appropriate tests, be found to be widely extended.\nThis is precisely what Reichenbach asserts,\u2014that to his sensitives the\nhuman body was invested with a phosphorescent light, which he\ncarefully tests and minutely describes.\nThe speaker continued :\u2014\" In the course of my investigation of\nthe alleged luminosity of the magnetic field, I found one sensitive\nwhose statements corroborated Reichenbach's assertions as to the\nlight from the human body. This sensitive was a somnambulist, an\nuneducated Irish lad named Fearnley, with whom I made the experi\nments on thought-transference at varying distances (described in Vol.\nII. of the Proceedings of the S.P.R., p. 13). The lad was placed for\nhalf-an-hour in a dark room in my laboratory, a room specially con\nstructed to ensure the most perfect darkness attainable : at the end of\nthat time he began to see the magnetic glow, which was very carefully\ntested. Suddenly he surprised me by exclaiming, ' I see you quite\nwell,' and in answer to questions said, 'You are moving your arm '\n(which was correct), 'you have two fingers open' (right), 'and now all\nfive ' (also right). (I am quoting from memory as to the number of\nfingers, but that is immaterial.) No hint was, of course, given to the\nboy as to Reichenbach's experiments, nor any suggestion made that he\nwas expected to see anything, and absolutely nothing was perceived\nby myself. To test the boy further, I took out my watch, and asked\nif he could see the time by it ; he asked me to put my fingers near the\nface, which I did, and at once he told me he could see where the hands\npointed by the light from my finger-tips. The watch being a keyless\none, I turned the hands round till they pointed to some unknown hour\nand again asked him the time as before. When I pointed my fingers to\nthe face of the watch, he said, ' Oh, it is different,' and gave me the\napparent time. Going outside through the double, light-tight door, I\nfound he was quite correct, and returning, tried him again, and again\nhe was right. A subsequent trial, on another day, did not prove so\nsuccessful ; the boy saw nothing. He evidently did not like being\nshut up in a dark room for a long time alone ; and the magnetic-glow\nexperiments had considerably taxed his time and patience, nor\n\fFEB., 1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 25\n\u2022could he be well spared from the occupation he was employed in ; so,\nto my regret, I had to let him go, and have not seen him since. Of\nthis, however, I was satisfied\u2014that a searching inquiry over a wide\nrange of persons, especially of those subject to natural or induced\nsomnambulism, would be of the deepest interest, and would probably\nbe found to confirm the amazing statements made by Reichenbach. I\nmyself am convinced that certain persons, under proper physical and\npsychical conditions, do see both a magnetic and a human glow. As\nthis luminosity might be due to ultra-violet radiation, and the crystal\nline lens largely absorbs these rays, I examined several persons upon\nwhom the operatioa of cataract had been performed, but in no casn\nfound them sensitive either to the magnetic or to the human glow.\"\nIn conclusion, Professor Barrett wished to call attention to two letters\nconnected with this subject written by two well-known and eminent\nscientific men, Professor E. F. Fitzgerald and Dr. W. Huggins, and\nwhich he had published in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. I., p. 236.\nPROFESSOR SIDGWICK, in closing the meeting, said that he was\ndesirous of preventing any misunderstanding as to the position\u2014he\nwould not say \" of the Society,\" which held no opinions in its collective\n\u2022capacity\u2014but of those who had taken an active part in its investi\ngations, in regard to the experiences of Mr. Stainton Moses, which had\nsupplied the chief basis of fact for Mr. Myers' speculations that after\nnoon. It must not be supposed that their investigators as a body\nregarded the physical phenomena reported among these experiences as\nestablished facts, which might be safely taken as data in scientific\ntheorising. On the contrary, in bringing the records of these experi\nences before the public, the Council had been careful to state that there\nwere wide differences of opinion among its members as to the inferences\nto be drawn from them. At the same time all would agree that, in\nbalancing the opposite improbabilities of the different possible inter\npretations of these experiences, the degree of difficulty found, as Mr.\nMyers had said, in \" fitting the phenomena into any scheme of Nature \"\nwas an important consideration ; and accordingly such an attempt as\nMr. Myers had made this afternoon to reduce this difficulty\u2014by point\ning out analogies between these phenomena and other facts, recognised\neither by scientific men generally, or at anyrate byPsychical Researchers\ngenerally\u2014would be, he thought, admitted by all to be a legitimate\nand interesting contribution to the discussion.\nCASE RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMITTEE.\nL. 982. A\u00ab Pn Apparition.\nThe following case is interesting, not only as an apparently veridical\nhallucination, but on account of the different stages through which the\nimpression passed. It will be noticed that it began with a vivid sense of\npresence, then took the form of an externalised visual hallucination, but\ntransparent, thus being what we called in the Report on th\u00b0. Census of\nHallucinations (Proceedinys, S.P.R., Part XXVI.) an incompletely\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1895.\ndeveloped hallucination, and finally assumed a \" pseudo-hallucinatory \"\nform. It belongs to the class of cases discussed in Chapter IV. of\nthe Report. See especially the experience of Miss S. given on p. 90.\nThe case was received by Mr. Myers from Mr. Kearne, of 37r\nAvonmore Gardens, West Kensington, on December 24th, 1894, and\nthe signatures of the two other witnesses were added to the account\nlater.\nOn the evening of February 10th, 1894, I was sitting in my room,\nexpecting the return of two friends from a concert in the provinces where\nthey had been performing. The friends in question had lived with me for\nsome years, and we were more than usually attached to one another. I had\nno knowledge by what particular train they intended returning to town, but\nknew when the last train they could catch was due to arrive in London\n(9.5 p.m.) and how long to a few minutes they would take from the terminus\nto get home (about 10 p.m.). Our profession entails a great deal of travelling;\nmy friends have had plenty of experience in this direction, and there was\nno question of their being well able to look after themselves. I may just\nadd that one of these friends has made this same journey weekly for the last\neight or nine years, so that I knew quite well his usual time of arrival at\nLiverpool-street.\nOn the day mentioned they were performing at an afternoon con\ncert, and I had every reason to believe they would be tired and get home\nas soon as possible. I allowed half-an-hour beyond the usual time\n(10.30 p.m.) of arrival to elapse before I got at all uneasy, speculating as\npeople will under such circumstances as to what was keeping them, although\narguing to myself all the time that there was not the slightest occasion for\nalarm. I then took up a book in which I was much interested, sitting in an\neasy chair before the tire with a reading lamp close to my right side, and in\nsuch a position that only by deliberately turning round could I see the\nwindow on my left, before which heavy chenille curtains were drawn. I had\nread some twenty minutes or so, was thoroughly absorbed in the book, my\nmind was perfectly quiet, and for the time being my friends were quite\nforgotten, when suddenly without a moment's warning my whole being\nseemed roused to the highest state of tension or aliveness, and I was aware,\nwith an intenseness not easily imagined by those who have never experienced\nit, that another being or presence was not only in the room but close to me.\nI put my book down, and although my excitement was great, I felt quite\ncollected and not conscious of any sense of fear. Without changing my\nposition, and looking straight at the fire, I knew somehow that my friend\nA. H. was standing at my left elbow, but so far behind me as to be hidden\nby the arm-chair in which I was leaning back. Moving my eyes round\nslightly without otherwise changing my position, the lower portion of one\nleg became visible, and I instantly recognised the grey-blue material of\ntrousers he often wore, but the stuff appeared semi-transparent, reminding\nme of tobacco smoke in consistency.1 I could have touched it with my hand\nwithout moving more than my left arm. With that curious instinctive wish\nnot to see more of such a \"figure,\" I did no more than glance once or twice\nat the apparition and then directed my gaze steadily at the fire in front of\nme. An appreciable space of time passed,\u2014probably several seconds in all,\nbut seeming in reality much longer,\u2014when the most curious thing happened.\nStanding upright between me and the window on my left, and at a distance\n1 The trousers of grey-blue stuff proved to be what A H. wore the evening the\nvision was seen.\n\f1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 2T\nof about four feet from me and almost immediately behind my chair, I saw\nperfectly distinctly the figure of my friend,\u2014the face very pale, the head\nslightly thrown back, the eyes shut, and on one side of the throat, just\nunder the jaw, a wound with blood on it. The figure remained motionless\nwith the arms close to the sides, and for some time, how long I can't say,\nI looked steadily at it ; then all at once roused myself, turned deliberately\nround, the figure vanished, and I realised instantly that I had seen the figure\nbehind me without moving from my first position,\u2014an impossible feat\nphysically. 1 am perfectly certain I never moved my position from the first\nappearance of the figure as seen physically, until it disappeared on my\nturning round.\nI should like to state that for the last fifteen years I have',been the\nwitness of psychic phenomena of almost every kind, that in consequence I\nam not flurried or afraid at their appearance as one strange to them would\nbe ; but in all that time never once has anything of a psychical nature hap\npened to me alone and unsought for ; it was in fact a unique experience to\nme. I was now of course thoroughly alarmed, and as rapidly as possible\nconsidered what was to be done. My first thought was to go to the railway\nterminus and see if anything had happened. I, however, carefully noted\nthe time (10.50 p.m.) by the clock in front of me, and reflected that if the\napparition meant an accident to my friend at anything like the time of its\nappearance, the last train had been due in London at least 1\u00a3 hours,\nso that it could not have happened on the journey home. How I got\nthrough the next 40 minutes, with our housekeeper worrying about our miss\ning friends, I don't know. At the end of this time I heard a hansom stop\nbefore the door (11.35 p.m.). My friends came in and apparently [did]\nnot hurry themselves to come up and see me, from which fact 1 felt reassured\nthat nothing very serious could have happened, or I should have been in\nformed of it at once. My friend B. then came up, saying, \" Come and see\nA. H., what a state he is in.\" I found him in the bathroom with his collar\nand shirt torn open, the front of the latter with blood upon it, and bathing\na wound under his jaw which was bleeding. His face was very pale, and he\nwas evidently suffering from a shock of some kind. As soon as I could, I got\nan account of what had happened.\nThey had arrived in London punctually, and feeling tired, although in\ngood spirits, drove with a third gentleman, who had been performing with\nthem, to a restaurant opposite King's Cross Station to have some supper.\nBefore leaving the restaurant, my friend, A. H. (whose apparition I saw),\ncomplained of feeling faint from the heat of the place, went out into the\nstreet to get some fresh air, and had hardly got into the open when he felt\nhis senses leave him, and he fell heavily forward, striking his jaw on the\nedge of the kerb, then rolling over on his back. On recovering conscious\nness, two policemen were standing over him, one of whom,\u2014failing to un\nfasten his collar to give him air,\u2014had cut both that and his tie. After inform\ning the rest of the party of what had happened, a cab was called, and my\ntwo friends were driven home as quickly as possible. The exact time that\nmy friend, A.H., fainted was not of course noted by them ; but judging by\nthe average time a cab takes to do the distance, cut rather short on this\noccasion in the effort to get A. H. home quickly, it would correspond within\nthree minutes to the time when the apparition appeared to me.\nIn conclusion it may be of interest to state that a curious mental sym\npathy seems to exist between A. H. and myself. In addition to the pheno\nmenon of saying the same thing at the same time and being aware on\nspecial occasions of one another's thoughts,I have on many occasions distinctly\nfelt his approach before seeing him, and generally when I have been walk\ning in the street and he has overtaken me on the top of the bus. On one\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., isos.\noccasion I was making a purchase in a shop, and the mm took his time\nwrapping up the article I wanted. Without any apparent reason, I began\nto get uneasy, and felt that unless he quickly handed me my parcel and let\nme go, I must leave it and go into the street. To his astonishment, I sud\ndenly rushed out of the shop, saw my friend riding past on a bus, signed to\nhim to come down, and we returned to the shop together. I don't know\nwhich of the three was most surprised.\n( PERCY KEARNE, January 9th, 1895 .\nSigned J ALFRED HOBDAY, January 9th, 1895 .\n( ARTHUR BENT, January 9th, 1895.\nMr. Myers writes :\u2014\nI had an interview with Mr. Kearne and Mr. Bent on December 29th,\n1894, when we went carefully over the times of the various incidents of the\nevening in question, and were satisfied that the accident and the apparition\nwere probably simultaneous.

PIPER.\nThe following extracts from an article which appeared in the\nJ\"igaro of January 14th, 1895, containing an account of a visit paid\nto Mrs. Piper by the distinguished French novelist, M. Paul Bourge t\nmay interest our readers.\nAfter describing his journey from Boston, accompanied by Dr.\nHodgson, to Mrs. Piper's house, M. Bourget continues :\u2014\nUne petite fille nous re^oit, toute rieuse, qui nous introduit dans le salon\nen nous disant que sa mere a eu beaucoup de se'ances ces jours-ci et qu'elle\nest bien fatigued.

The case was\ncommunicated in 1893 to the Societd de me'decine d'Angers by Dr.\nQuintard, whose report of his personal observations was confirmed at\nthe time by Dr. Tesson. Dr. Petrucci, Director of the Asylum of\nMaine-et-Loire, and several other medical men also examined the\npercipient (who is called Ludovic X.), and apparently found no flaw\nin the report of his powers.\nDr. Quintard states that, in spite of the fact that Ludovic X. had\nexcellent health, and that both he and his parents, as far as the medical\nmen could discover, were entirely free from any kind of nervous\ndisorder, he showed promise, at the age of 5 years, of rivalling the feats\nof the most celebrated calculating boys. His mother began to teach\nhim the multiplication table, but found that he could say it as well\nas she could, and he gave correct answers to the most complicated\npro blems in mental arithmetic without a ' pause. An intuitive\n\f'30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1S95.\nfaculty for languages, as well as for mathematics, seemed developed in\nthis infant prodigy, who would translate at hearing any sentence in\nEnglish, Spanish or Greek, and gave a satisfactory solution of a\nLatin riddle. To the disappointment of his parents and friends, these\napparently remarkable powers turned out to be due to nothing but\ntelepathy. It was almost always necessary that his mother should\nfix her mind on the right answer to the problem, whatever it was,\n'before he could give it, and he could repeat equally well anything\nelse that she was thinking of, such as a given number or word, or\nany card drawn from a pack. His unerring capacity for guessing his\nmother's thoughts was found to be a serious drawback when she\n'tried to teach him to read. He read from her mind instead of from\nthe book, and exercising neither his judgment nor his memory, made no\nprogress. Ingenious devices had to be resorted to to baffle him, and\n\u2022everything was done to discourage and stifle the telepathic power on\nthe advice of Dr. Quintard, who wrote to Dr. Dariex (Editor of the\nAnnales), in September, 1894, that it seemed to be gradually dis\nappearing ; on some days, Ludovic X. could only guess the beginnings\nof words, instead of the whole of them.\nTHE NEED FOR EXPERIMENTS IN AUTOMATISM.\nI venture to repeat once more to our readers the request already\nso often made\u2014for more experiments in automatism ; a larger crop\nof subliminal messages or crystal-visions. Let me once more point\nout that there is nothing superstitious in experiments of this kind; we\nare not asking for such messages as authoritative revelations from the\nispirit-world, but rather as indications of what is going on in ourselves\nbeneath the threshold of our ordinary consciousness. I believe,\nindeed, that strange faculties are there operating; but nothing can be\nmore legitimate than to test by actual experiment the evidence for\nsuch faculties which automatic writing may or may not afford.\nThe simplest plan, for those who can do so, is merely to hold a\npencil and allow automatic writing to supervene. But it often happens\nthat more persons than one have to combine in order to obtain any\nresponse ; so that a planchette or some similar instrument becomes\nneedful. A Cambridge friend has devised two little instruments of\nthis kind, which he thus describes :\u2014\n\" Pytho is an instrument consisting of a flat wooden disc marked\nwith letters and numbers round a part of its circumference and pro\n\f1895.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 31\nvided with a central pin, about which there rotates an arrangement\nof a brass pointer extending to the letters, and three shorter arms\nfitted with revolving handles. It is made in two sizes, and may be\nused for the indication of automatic messages by one, two, or three\npersons.\n\" Chrao is a device of four short arms at right angles, which unite\nin a small wooden ball pierced at its centre to receive a pencil for\ndirect writing or a smooth-footed leg for the indication of letters\nprinted on an accompanying chart. It maybe used by one, two, three,\nor four persons and furnishes a convenient rest for automatic writing.\n\" These instruments have been designed with the object of obtain\ning clearness in the messages with as little friction as possible in\n\u2022operation. They are published by F. H. Ayres, 111, Aldersgate-\nstreet, London, Pytho at 7s. 6d. and 3s., Chrao at Is. 6d. and 2s., with\ntwo of the arms detachable.\"\nThese instruments form, I think, a decided improvement on the\n\u2022ordinary \" planchette \" or \" ouija-board.\" The mechanism, however,\nmatters comparatively little, so long as in some way\u2014be it with crystal,\nor pencil, or \"Pytho,\" or \"Chrao\"\u2014patient and careful experiment is\nmade.\nF.

There were\nalso present Dr. A. W. Barrett, Dr. W. Leaf, and Messrs. F. W. H.\nMyers, F. Podmore, Sydney C. Scott, and H. Arthur Smith.\nDr. Abraham Wallace was co-opted as a Member of the Council\nfor the current year.\n\f34 Meeting of the Council.\nNine new Associates were elected, whose names and addresses\nare given above. The election of nine new Associates of the\nAmerican Branch was recorded.\nAt her request the name of Mrs. Pitman Hooper was transferred\nfrom the List of Members to that of Associates. M. Antoine\nD'Abbadie, of Paris, also desires to be an Associate instead of a\nMember, and has subscribed as a Life Associate.\nThe Council heard with regret of the death of Mr. Bainbridge R.\nBell, an Associate of the Society.\nSome presents to the Library were reported, for which a vote of\nthanks was passed to the donors.\nThe House and Finance Committee presented a report and an\nestimate of Income and Expenditure for the current year. It was\nagreed to adopt and as far as possible carry out its proposals and\nrecommendations.\nIt was arranged that, in addition to the General Meetings already\nfixed for April 5th and May 17th, one should be held on Friday,\nJuly 5th, at 4 p. m.\nVarious other matters having been discussed, the Council\nagreed that its next meeting should be at the Westminster Town\nHall, on Friday, April 5th, at 3 p.m., previous to the General\nMeeting on that day.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 71st General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, March 1st, at 8.30 p.m. ; Mr. Pearsall\nSmith in the chair.\nMRS. A W. VERRALL read a paper on \" Some Experiments in\nthe Supernormal Acquisition of Knowledge,\" of which the following\nis an abstract :\u2014\nThe principal experiments were made with playing cards, the\nresults being classified according to the supposed cause of success, (if\nany), under five heads.\n(A.)\u2014Delicate sense of touch.

The impression of the guessers was that there was an\nactual appearance of the backs which suggested the face of the card,\nbut it could not be determined whether this was really the case.\n(E.) Telesthesia, so called because the senses of the percipient were\nused in the process of guessing, but the knowledge of the card\nselected was in the mind of the agent. The experiment was similar\nto some described by M. Roux in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques\nfor July, 1893. The agent selected a card from a small number\u2014\nthirteen\u2014and the percipient, at a distance, with her back turned,\ntransferred thirteen similar cards from hand to hand till she had\nan impulse to stop. When Mrs. Verrall was percipient she had no\nsuccess. H. as percipient guessed the card rightly 21 times in 150\ntrials ; the most probable number of correct guesses by chance being\n11'5.\nTowards the end of this series, Mrs. Verrall began to know when\nH. had been successful, and recorded her impressions before H.'s\nguess was made. Of 11 such recorded impressions, 9 were right.\nFurther, some cases of apparent experimental telepathy, with H.\nas agent, were related ; a scene was thought of by the agenc, and\n-described or drawn by the percipient. Where the scene was vividly\nrealised by H., Mrs. Verrall seemed to have some success in\nreproducing the outline, though without recognising the object drawn.\nME. F. W. H. MYERS remarked that the series in which Mrs.\nVerrall, after first receiving her impressions in a vague, non-specialised\n\f36 Dr. Hodgson. [MAR.\u2014APR., 1395.\nmanner, ultimately came to apprehend them in a, quasi-visual\nmanner, seemed to confirm the view which explained many\napparitions as being essentially non-specialised impressions, which\ntook a sensory shape through the action of the percipient's own mind\nupon them, that sensory shape being determined by the mode of\nmental imagery most familiar to the percipient.\nThe vague satisfaction felt by Mrs. Verrall when an effort at\ntelepathic communication had succeeded, (although she had as yet na\nother knowledge of its success), resembled the satisfaction recorded in\nsome of our reciprocal cases, where the dying person becomes some\nhow aware that he has succeeded in impressing a distant friend.\nMiss M. H. MASON remarked that when performing telepathic\nexperiments of the same character, she also had felt a like inward\nmonition of success, when (as afterwards proved) the impression had\nbeen correctly transmitted.\nMR. H. G. RAWSON read a paper on \" Experiments in Thought-\ntransference,\" which will be published in the forthcoming part of\nthe Proceedings.\nA paper by Mr. C. HiLL-TouT, on \" Some Psychical Phenomena\nbearing on the question of Spirit Control,\" was taken as read, for want\nof time.\nTHE VALUE OF THE EVIDENCE FOR SUPERNORMAL.\nPHENOMENA IN THE CASE OF EUSAPIA PALADINO.\nBY RICHARD HODGSON, LL.D.\nIn thinking over the general subject of Human Testimony to super\nnormal phenomena, it was forced upon me how little of really\nintelligent criticism is passed upon our records by persons who do\nnot nevertheless accept our conclusions. From more or less\nuninterested outsiders this course is not surprising. But the same\ntemper of mind which we find in outsiders is perhaps not altogether\nabsent from our own interested members. The phenomena do not fit\nwith sundry preconceptions. But those of us who are trying to appraise\nthe evidence for all these supernormal phenomena for what it is worth,\nno more and no less,\u2014perhaps I ought to add certainly no more, as we\nmay be regarded as having a bias in the other direction, \u2014must account\nto ourselves for our own acceptance or rejection of certain testimony.\nWe must explain the testimony itself in a reasonable manner.\nI propose now to examine the testimony offered for the alleged\nsupernormal phenomena occurring in the presence of Eusapia\nPaladino,\u2014and chiefly the testimony offered by Professor Lodge* in\nthe Journal for November. In Vol. II. of the Journal I made an\nanalysis of a series of reports of sittings with Eglinton, and endeavoured\nto show that, allowing such margins for misdescription in the accounts\n* The Report is more or less joint, but Professor Lodge seems to have adopted the-\nresponsibility of it, in its present form at least.\n\fMAS.\u2014APR., 1885.) Evidence in Case of Eusapia Paladino. 37\nas we were warranted by experience in supposing possible, the\nphenomena which occurred in the presence of Eglinton could be\naccounted for by ordinary means. How far can a similar analysis\naccording to certain estimates of testimony and principles of\napplication which were given us some years ago by a special investiga\ntion into phenomena of the kind before us,\u2014how far, I say, can such\nan analysis lead to a plausible explanation of the testimony offered for\nEusapia without supposing the occurrence of supernormal phenomena 1\nThat Professor Lodge holds such a strong conviction as to the\ngenuineness of these is in itself a highly significant fact, seeing that\nbis conclusions seem to rest for their validity on the continuous\nobservation employed by the witnesses, and in 1886 Professor Lodge\nagreed with Gurney in considering that \" conditions which do not\nexclude the necessity for continuous close observation can never be\n\u2022completely satisfactory.\" (Journal S. P. R, Vol. II., p. 290). Not\nhaving shared his personal experience, I must confine myself to the\ninferences to be drawn from his printed account.\nProceeding to the description of the conditions of the experiments\nas given in the Excerpts from the Detailed Notes, I begin with the\nreport of the first sitting. One of the first questions to be asked\n\u2022concerns the adequacy of the box with pedals to prevent Eusapia's\nusing either of her feet. We are not told how much force was needed\nto depress the pedals. It may have been possible for Eusapia to have\nplaced a weight or weights on the pedals adequate to keep the bell\nfrom ringing. These weights may have been in the shape of a foot.\nShe may have had dummy feet padded with soft material and weighted\nenough to depress the pedals to the required extent,. This suggestion\nof course leads to the mention of a precaution which perhaps it was\nimpossible to take under the circumstances. As we shall see later, the\npossibility that Eusapia should have special apparatus about her person\nshould be excluded, or at least special precautions should be taken for\nthe purpose of excluding it. To this end it would be desirable that\ne.g., under the supervision of women she should remove her clothing\ncompletely in one room and thence pass into another where she should\ndon clothing specially provided by her investigators. Even under these\nconditions, except under very minute scrutiny, it would be difficult to\nbe certain that apparatus occupying very small space was not excluded,\nbut careful watching by several observers might prevent the conceal\nment of any bulky apparatus such as a weighted dummy foot. I do\nnot think it probable that any suoh device, either a dummy foot, or a\nweight attached to the leg, <fcc., was as a matter of fact used by Eusapia,\nbut there is nothing in the report which prevents the possibility of\nsuch a supposition. There is no description at all in the report about\nthe circumstances connected with Eusapia's taking her place, nothing\nsaid, e.g., as to whether she did or did not stoop down, ostensibly for\nthe purpose of arranging her dress, but really for the purpose of\nwedging a pedal so that it would not rise when she lifted her foot.\nThe next point to notice is that we are not told how Eusapia's\nhands were held. How the sitters \"joined hands round \" is im\n\f38 Dr.- Hodgson. [MAR.-ApR.,is9&.\nmaterial for my present purpose, as I do not entertain the hypothesis\nthat one of the sitters was fraudulent. But precisely how Eusapia's\nhands were held on the occasion of each and every phenomenon is of\ncourse of the utmost importance. No description is given of the dress\nof the medium, beyond the fact that it was black, the most suitable\ncolour for trick performances where so much darkness prevailed. We\nare not told what sort of sleeves she wore or whether it was impossible\nfor her to use a well-known conjuring device attached to the forearm\nor wrist and used for lifting tables. She might have worn straps on\nher shoulders or upper arms, with hooks or other forms of clip append\nages which she might have attached unnoticed to the table. The\nend of it, when not in actual use, might have been concealed in her\ndress-front. She may have had mechanisms attached to other portions\nof her body. Less than a year ago I became acquainted with a simple\npiece of apparatus made for the production of raps, and which was\nnew to me. It is worked by moving the knees apart, the feet and\nhands remaining stationary. It seems to me possible that a variation\nof this might be made which could be worked by some of the body\nmuscles or shoulder muscles or even the thigh muscles, and be utilised\nin lifting. The result of the knee movement in the piece of apparatus\nreferred to above is to cause the projection of a steel rod which on the\nreversal of the original movement is drawn back by a rubber band.\nFor the steel rod substitute a folded umbrella-like or other expansible\nobject, and with a little adaptation you could have a piece of apparatus\nwhich might, so far as the verbal description in the report goes,account\nfor the \" protuberances or gonflements \" witnessed near Eusapia's left\nleg. Moreover, the apparatus occupies little room, and might be\nconcealed between the stocking and the leg and not suspected by a\nsearcher unless the stocking were removed. The supposition of such\nan instrument, however, is probably far from necessary. It is not\nindicated whether Professor Lodge could see the whole of Eusapia's\nfeet. The reader may think that this is intended, but if so it should\nhave been specifically expressed. Eusapia may have kept pressure on\nthe pedal with the toe of her left foot, and raised her heel to the esti\nmated height of \" about twelve inches \" from the floor. I suppose\nthat the pedal upon which her foot rested must have been raised some\nwhat from the floor. When Professor Lodge speaks of both her feet\nas being \" distinctly visible on the machine,\" does he mean that he\ncould distinctly see the stockinged foot, the whole flat of it resting on\nthe pedal,\u2014or does he mean that he could see the toe part projecting\nbeyond the edge of Eusapia's dress ? In connexion with this point I\nmay quote Professor Richet's remarks on what he observed during his\nfirst and second seances with Eusapia :\n\"J'e'tais a gauche d'Eusapia ; je tenais sa main gauche ; je tenais avec\nle pied son pied, ou ses pieds, et je voyais m6me cfepasser les deux bouts\ndes bottines d'Eusapia par-dessous sa robe. Or, quoique je visse nettement\nles bouts de ses bottines, quoique j'eusse la main gauche a plat sur ses\ngenoux immobiles, je voyais (ou je croyais voir) la robe d'Eusapia se gonfler,\ncomme pour se diriger tvers le pied gauche de la table, place fort en arriere\n\fMAR.-APR., i8\u00bb5.] Evidence in Case of Eusapia Paladino. 39\ndes genoux et des pieds d'Eusapia. II serable que, dans les mouvements\nd'oscillation preliminaires de la table, d'une part la table eut chercW a se\nrapprocher de la robe, d'autre part la robe en se gonflant eut cherche a se\nrapprocher du pied de la table, de maniere a 1'entourer d'ombre.\n\"A quelques jours de la, je parlai de ce phenomene a M. Chiaia, qui me\ndit que c'etait par ce gonflement de la robe, toujours constate' par lui, que\nse faisait le soulevement du quatrieme pied de la table. Je mentionne le\nfait sails y insister ; car il est trop etrange pour que 1'observation super-\nficielle que j'en ai faite puisse compter.\"\u2014Annales des (Sciences Psychiques\n(Jan. -Feb., 1893, p. 9).\nAfter reference to the raps and tilts and change of position of\nsitters we learn :\u2014\n\"The machine was now soon dispensed with. L. held the left hand\nof E. and had one of her feet on his. M. held the other hand and foot\nsimilarly ; and they continually kept each other informed as to the security\nof each. E. had no shoes on, and M. and L. had on soft slippers so that\nthey could be sure of really feeling feet. There was often a twitching of her\nbody and spasmodic jerking of her fingers, but never sufficient to cause loss\nof control. The lamp was lowered.\n\" 10.21.\u2014The first distinctly abnormal occurrence took place now, when\neverything was under perfect control as stated. M. was touched lightly on\nthe back several times.\"\nFirstly, as to the feet. I venture to think that the precautions as\ndescribed were entirely insufficient. Professor Lodge may have satisfied\nhimself by experiments that he could not have been deceived by the\nsubstitution of a dummy foot, or by the pressure of Eusapia's right\nfoot at the same time pressing on M.'s slippered foot. Has Professor\nLodge made such experiments ? If so, he ought to have mentioned the\nfact. If not, ought he to be \" sure of really feeling feet,\" especially as\nEusapia's body was apparently very far from still 1\nProfessor Richet writes concerning a different experience :\u2014\n\" D'abord notons que, pendant toute la dure'e de 1'experience, chacun\ndes assistants voisins tient un pied ou un des pieds d'Eusapia tantot\nau-dessus, tantot au-dessous de son pied : par consequent, elle ne peut\nmouvoir les pieds, e'tant ainsi assujettie par les pieds de ses voisins.\n\"Toutefois, il faut bien le reconnaltre, cette surveillance est plus ou\nmoins illusiore ; car a. travers la semelle de nos souliers, il nous est im\npossible de savoir exactement quel pied nous tenons sous le notre : est-ce\nle pied droit d'Eusapia 1 est-ce son pied gauche ? et nous ne pouvons\nabsolument pas savoir s'il n'y a pas eu substitution un peu avant le moment\nou la table s'est souleve'e ; puis, quand le soulevement de la table a eu lieu,\nle pied d'Eusapia serait revenu a sa place.\n\"Je le re'pete, le controle des pieds d'Eusapia maintenus par lea pieds\ndes assistants est un controle illusiore.\n\" J'ai voulu alors, dans une autre experience, proce'der autrement, et,\napres avoir propose' de maintenir les pieds d'Eusapia avec mon pied\nde'chausse', j'ai finalement essaye^ de lui tenir les deux pieds avec ma main.\"\n\u2014Annales des Sciences Psychiques, Jan. -Feb., 1893, p. 6.\nNow although Eusapia in Professor Lodge's experiment was in\nstockinged feet, and Professor Lodge and Mr. Myers had only soft\nslippers, I think Professor Richet's judgment still applies to their\nexperience. The circumstances by no means involve a \" perfect control \"\n\f40 Dr. Hodgson. [MAR.\u2014APR., iso5.\nof the feet. Any phenomena that occurred under the above conditions\nand that could be accounted for on the supposition that at least one of\nEusapia's feet was free, could certainly, in my opinion, not lay any\nclaim to be supernormal.\nNow for the \" perfect control \" of the hands. It is to be presumed\nthat L.'s left hand was joined to R.'s right hand, and that L. was not\nholding Eusapia's left hand with both of his hands. He was holding her\nleft hand in some way or other with his right ; and M. was holding her\nright hand in some way or other with his left. But in what precisely\nparticular way was each of these persons holding the hand assigned to\nhis care 1 When the Report says \" M. held the other hand and foot\nsimilarly,\" I don't suppose that the word similarly is intended to indi\ncate that M. was holding E.'s right hand in the same way that L. was\nholding her left. In any case we are not informed in detail how either\nof Eusapia's hands was actually held. This omission appears to me\nto be of the very gravest nature. And for the following reasons :\u2014\nThe only other reports about Eusapia which I have seen are those of\nthe Milan Commission and Professor Richet (Annales des Sciences\nPsychiques, January\u2014February, 1893) and Dr. Carl du Prel\n(Psychische Studien for December 1892). In all these reports the\nhands of Eusapia are described as being \" held,\" but in each one of them\nthere is some reference to the difficulty of \" holding \" them during the\n\" spasmodic \" movements of the medium. I quote the following :\u2014\n\" Tous ceux qui nient la possibilite' des phenomenes me'dianimiques\nessaient d'expliquer ces faits en supposant que le medium a la faculW (declared\nimpossible par le professeur Richet) de voir dans 1'obscurite complete oil\nse faisaient les experiences, et que celui-ci, par un habile artifice, en s'agitant\nde mille manieres dans 1'obscurite, finit par faire tenir la meme main par sea\ndeux voisins, en rendant 1'autre libre pour produire les attouchements, etc.\nCeux d'entre nous qui ont eu 1'occasion d'avoir en garde les mains d'Eusapia\nsont obliges d'avouer que celle-ci ne se pretait assure'ment pas a faciliter\nleur surveillance et k les rendre a tout instant surs de leur fait.\n\" Au moment oil allait se produire quelque phenomene important, elle\ncommencait a s'agiter de tout son corps, se tordant et essayant de delivrer\nses mains, surtout la droite, comme d'un contact genant. Pour rendre leur\nsurveillance continue, ses voisins \u00a3taient obliges de suivre tous les mou-\nvements de la main fugitive, operation pendant laquelle il n'eiait pas rare\nde perdre son contact pendant quelques instants, juste au moment oil il\ne'taitle plus desirable de s'en bien assurer. II n'e'tait pas toujours facile de\nsavoir si Ton tenait la main droite ou la main gauche du me'dium.\u2014Annales\ndes Sciences Psyckiqties, pp. 52\u201453.\n\"Dans les experiences, Eusapia n'a pas en ge'ne'ral, la main tenue de la\nmeme maniere k droite et k gauche. D'un cote, on lui tient fortement le\npoignet et la main ; de 1'autre cote', au lieu d'avoir la main tenue par le\nvoisin, elle se contente de poser sa main sur la main du voisin, mais de la\nposer avec tous ses doigts, de maniere qu'on puisse sentir tres distinctement\nsi 1'on tient la main gauche ou droite.\n\" Voici alors ce qui se passe : Au moment ou va commencer le\nphenomene, cette main qui n'est pas tenue par le voisin, mais se pose sur sa\nmain (je suppose qu'il s'agisse, pour simplifier, de la main droite d'Eusapia,\nquoiqu'elle opere ainsi tantot k droite, tantot a gauche), cette main devient\ntres mobile, presque insaisissable : a chaque instant elle se de'place, et\n\fMAR.\u2014APR., 1895.] Evidence in Case, of Eusapia Paladino. 41\npendant une fraction minuscule de seconde on ne la sent plus ; puis on la\nsent de nouveau, et on peut constater que c'est toujours la main droite.\n\" Alors il peut arriver ceci : c'est que pendant oette fraction de seconde\nla main droite d'Eusapia est devenue libre et a su se porter a droite ou a\n.gauche, toucher la tete, la figure, le cou d'un des assistants. En outre, la\nmain gauche, tenue au poignet, peut s'appliquer sur le dos de la main de\n1'assistant de droite, qui continue a croire qu'il tient la main droite, alors\nqu'en realite il est touche par la main gauche d'Eusapia, qui a alors sa main\ndroite parfaitement libre.\n\" De meme que tout a 1'heure, en parlant de la table souleve'e. j'etais\narrive a la conviction que le seul true possible etait le soulevement de la\ntable par le pied d'Eusapia, de meme, pour le contact senti d'une main\nhumaine, le seul true possible c'est qu'Eusapia degage une de ses mains et\ntouche les assistants avec cette main devenue libre, pendant que les deux\nvoisins croiront 1'un et 1'autre toucher une main diffe'rente d'Eusapia. S'il\ny a un true employe, je n'en congois pas d'autre, et il me paralt inutile de\ndiscuter toute autre hypothese, celle d'un compere parmi les assistants ou\nd'un autre individu s'introduisant dans la chambre.\n\"Avant d'entrer dans le detail des experiences memes, ilfaut mentionner\n\u00abncore une remarque que M. Chiaia nous a faite : c'est que souvent la main\nqui touche 1'e'paule ou la joue d'un des assistants est la main d'Eusapia elle-\nmeme. Cependant il y aurait aussi materialisation d'une main ; car la main\nd'Eusapia est devenue libre, parce que la main (de John) materialised s'est\nmise sur la main du voisin d'Eusapia, et a pris la place de la main d'Eusapia.\nJe m'abstiens ici de juger cette interpretation : je me contente de la\nrapporter, telle qu'elle m'a ete donnee par M. Chiaia.\"\u2014Annales des Sciences\nPsychiques, pp. 14\u201415.\n\" Jamais il n'y a eu contact senti d'une main alors que les deux mains\nd'Eusapia etaient en vue toutes les deux : il a toujours fallu que 1'obscurite\nfut complete ou que les deux mains fussent cachees sous la table.\"\u2014Annales\ndes Sciences Psychiques, p. 18.\n\"Une des mains d'Eusapia, aulieu d'etre saisie fortement et immobilised,\nrepose legerement sur le dos de la main de son voisin ; et elle se de'place\ncans cesse, ce qui rend la distinction (entre la main droite et la main gauche)\nsingulierement difficile.\"\u2014Annales des Sciences Psychiques, p. 19.\n\" Mais de meme je ne dois pas ne'gliger de dire que jamais il n'y a eu de\nmain sentie, quand les deux mains d'Eusapia etaient en pleine lumiere, ou\ntenues toutes deux par un fil, ou tenues par la meme personne.\"\u2014Annales des\nSciences Psychiques, p. 20.\n\"A la cinquieme seance, nous eumes aussi 1'apparition d'une main ; mais\nles conditions etaient moins rigoureuses. Je tenais la main droite d'Eusapia,\net je ne suis pas du tout sur de 1'avoir bien tenue.\n\"De plus la main que nous vimes etait tout a fait analogue a la main\nd'Eusapia, bien differente de la main que nous avions vue la veille.\n\"Cela confirmerait peut-etre 1'opinion de M. Chiaia, opinion fondee sur\nune longue experience du medium, que, dans certains cas, la main qui\ntouche et qui apparait, c'est la main veritable d'Eusapia, tandis que la main\nqui est tenue par les assistants qui controlent, c'est la main materialisee de\nJohn.\"\u2014Annales des Sciences Psychiques, p. 22.\nIt appears also from these reports that an Italian gentleman, Torelli,\nhas written certain articles in which he maintains that Eusapia gets\none hand free and uses it for the production of spurious phenomena,\nmaking the other hand do duty for two.\nIt was therefore of the utmost importance that the guarding of\nEusapia's hands should be very specially considered,\u2014and that the\n\f42 Dr. Hodgson. [MAR.-ATR., 1395,\nfullest possible details concerning the management of her hands by the\nadjoining sitters should be given in the report. This omission then\nis a very serious one, and suggests that there may be other very\nimportant omissions about which we are left to speculate. Professor\nLodge may say to this :\n\" Such criticism is child's play ! I was familiar with the articles to\nwhich you refer ; Myers and myself had discussed this very point ad\nnauseam with each other and Richet, and we were fully alive to all\nthat you suggest. We knew all about the variations of the old trick\nof making one hand do duty for two. I have often in the darkness\nmade a witness believe he felt the continuous contact of both my\nhands at a time when really only one of my hands was in contact with\nhis,\u2014and under these circumstances I have encircled round his arm a\nclosed ring that was previously lying on an adjoining table. This and\nsimilar dodges were perfectly well known to us, and you may be\nassured that nothing of that sort happened during our experiments\nwith Eusapia.\"\nIf such be Professor Lodge's reply, I have no hesitation in saying\nthat he has forsaken the scientific method. His record amounts in that\ncase to the mere giving of his personal opinion, and with all due\nrespect to Professor Lodge's achievements in other branches of\ninvestigation, I have no reason for thinking that he is an expert in\ndealing with fraudulent mediums. Even if Professor Lodge is such an\nexpert, what we want to get is the exact description, as far as possible,\nof the conditions under which the alleged supernormal events occurred,\nand we should then be compelled to allow, under circumstances like\nthose prevailing at Eusapia's performances, a liberal margin for mis-\ndescription. Professor Lodge most assuredly is not giving us a detailed\nrecord of the most important of these conditions. Yet this, I take\nit, is what we are after. As Professor Richet says :\n\" Meme si un savant illustre me venait raconter ces faits, je ne me\ncontenterais pas de son affirmation, et je voudrais connaitre les proce'de's\npar lui dans ses experiences.\"\u2014Annales des Sciences Psychiques, p. 28,\nIn his introduction Professor Lodge writes (Journal S.P.R.,\nNovember, p. 315) :\u2014\n\" Usually the sitter on her right holds her right hand, and the sitter on\nher left holds her left, the whole forearm being frequently held as well as\nthe hand. All this precautionary holding is entirely acquiesced in by the\nmedium ; and before anything striking occurs she usually calls attention to\nthe position of each hand and foot separately, and frequently places her\nhead in contact with one or other of the sitters, so that its locality may be\nknown too. The sitters were well aware of the necessity for secure holding\nof the medium's genuine hands and feet, and continually called out to each\nother as to the security or otherwise of that portion of the body of the\nmedium which they had in trust.\"\nThese statements obviously do not help us as regards the details of\nany particular experiment, and I look in vain through JSoccerpl*\nfrom the Detailed Notes without finding any detailed description of the\nmost important point of all in the whole series of experiments.\n\fMAR.\u2014APR., lag5.] Evidence in Case of Eusapia Paladino. 43\nLet us take an illustration from another subject. Suppose the\nquestion to be whether we can get hot ice, and let us suppose that I\nhave written a paper describing an experiment where I think I have\nobtained hot ice. I describe my bottle and my tube, my production of\na vacuum in the tube, my heating apparatus, etc., etc., and go on to\nsay that I formed some ice in the vacuum, turned my gas flames on to the\ntube containing it, and that the thermometer registering the temperature\nof the ice rose above the boiling point of water. I give a list of various\nhigh temperatures read from the thermometer, and Professor Lodge\nfinds in my paper a statement by me that without doubt these figures\nrepresent the temperature of the ice, but he is not vouchsafed any\ninformation as to the precise relations between the ice and the\nthermometer bulb. Let us suppose further that previous experimenters\nhad also claimed to have obtained hot ice under conditions which we\nmay describe as generally similar to those mentioned in my imaginary\npaper, but that over and over again it had been demonstrated (to\nProfessor Lodge's satisfaction at least) that not sufficient care had been\ntaken to embed the bulb in the ice originally or to prevent the bulb's\nbeing denuded of the ice in one place or another, even though originally\nembedded in the ice,\u2014and that hence the experiments were regarded as\nworthless. Suppose further yet that Professor Lodge ascertains from\nthe accounts of previous experimenters from whom I obtained the very\nidentical apparatus which I employed, that, owing to some peculiarity\nin the apparatus, they were unable to completely embed the bulb in the\nice to begin with, or the bulb was habitually denuded at times before the\ntemperature rose, etc. He looks in my paper for the details of my\nmethod of embedding the bulb in the ice, for the observations which I\ntook to assure myself that there was never any denudation when the\nthermometer rose above Zero, and he finds nothing whatsoever about\nthese points ; the most he can find is a frequent statement that the\nbulb was in contact with the ice. I venture to think that the omissions\nfrom niy imaginary paper are comparable with those which I find in\nProfessor Lodge's report concerning the details of holding. And I may\nadd further that in Eusapia's case the investigator must assume that\nhe is dealing with an acute person who has had much experience in\ntrickery, and who is doing her utmost to deceive him on the very point\nin question. This is a special difficulty which the investigator in the\nordinary physical sciences is not accustomed to reckon with, and I\ncannot but think that Professor Lodge has not allowed enough for this\nfactor of wilful deception in the subject of his experiments.\nIt is to be inferred from Professor Richet's statements that, at the\nsittings which he reported, it was customary for one of Eusapia's hands,\nto form contact by resting on the hand of the adjacent sitters. She\ndid not allow, apparently, both hands to be seized by the sitters. Now\nif, in Professor Lodge's experiments, Eusapia did allow this kind of\nholding to be applied to both hands, there ought to have been, in.\nProfessor Lodge's account, a very full and explicit mention of that fact.\nSince there is no mention of it, we are justified in inferring that the\nkind of holding to which she was subjected by Professor Lodge was of\n\f44 Dr. Hodgson. [MAR.\u2014APR , 1895.\nthe kind described by Professor Richet. It will be seen that each of\nEusapia's feet is described as \" held \" when she has it on a foot of a\nsitter. And I suppose that her hand may also be described as \" held \"\nwhen she has it on the hand of a sitter.\nIn the absence, then, of carefully described conditions of holding\nsuch as would absolutely prevent Eusapia's getting one hand free, we\nare justified in assuming that she did get one hand free, in which case\nmany of the supposed supernormal occurrences at the sitting can\nobviously be accounted for by ordinary means. The objects which\nwere heard or felt to move, &c., may have been objects within reach of\nthe medium in the room, including possibly articles which she had con\ncealed about her person. Objects not originally within reach of her\narm may have been hooked to within her reach by some simple con\ntrivance also concealed about her person. And we must not forget\nthat Eusapia may be supposed sometimes to have a leg free as well as\nan arm. Thus under 10.21\u2014\" M. was touched lightly on the back\nseveral times,\" Under 10.24\u2014\"M. was again touched distinctly in\nthe back.\" Now we are at liberty to suppose, e.g., that on one of these\noccasions M. may have been touched by Eusapia's hand, and on the\nother occasion by her foot, or by an instrument held in Eusapia's mouth.\nI need not specify in detail the occurrences which I suppose can be\naccounted for by the use of Eusapia's freed arm or foot, or mouth\nwhen this was not guarded. Incidents which appear to demand some\nother hypothesis, or to need comment for other reasons, I will consider\nspecially.\nI pass on to other details of the report.\nUnder 10.30 we read: \"Both E.'s feet were now firmly held by\nM.\" Under 10.51 we read : \" While L. held head and both hands, and\nM. held both feet.\" Again, what were the details of these holdings ?\nUnder 11.2 the movement of the large table was mentioned, but\nthere is nothing to show its exact distance from Eusapia.\nUnder 10.49 we read: \"Nearly dark again.\" Under 10.51 we\nlearn that : \" L. held head and both hands, and M. held both feet.\"\nUnder 11.2 we read, \" Hands and feet well held.\" Under 11.9 we\nread, \" hands and feet held all the time.\" Under 11.10 it appears\nthat Eusapia's fingers \" were being held constantly in the hand of M.\"\nNo mention is made of when and under what circumstances M. re\nsumed his \" holding \" of a hand.\nUnder 11.14 we read : \" Hands being held all round, the large\ntable approached, answered questions by tilts, and rose entirely in the\nair, being dimly visible to O. It was entirely untouched.\" Are we to\naccept the statement that this table rose entirely in the air on the\nground that\u2014in the dim light which prevailed\u2014O. thought that he\nsaw it do so ? What precautions were taken to prove that it was\n\" entirely untouched 1 \" This is doubtless an inference from the\nsupposed \" complete control \" of Eusapia's person. I see no difficulty\nat all in the supposition that Eusapia herself moved the table, turned\nit over, and exhibited the \" faint lights,\" and that she also made the\nblue scrawl on the table. After, we will suppose, having made this\n\fMAK.\u2014APR., lag5.] Evidence vn Case of Eusapia Paladino. 45-\nscrawl,\u2014made, perhaps, while the table was on its side,\u2014she \" an\nnounced that ' John ' would write and asked which table it should\nbe on.\"\nThe sitters were hardly likely to choose the small table at which\nthey were sitting. The choice was then restricted to the large table\nand the round table. There may of course have been a mark\npreviously made by Eusapia on the round table to cover the emer\ngency. None of the sitters apparently thought of examining it\nafterwards. Or, if the round table had been chosen it might have\nbeen too far away from Eusapia for the \" control \" to act. The round\ntable did not begin to move until at a later period in the sitting, after\nthe small table had been moved much nearer to it, and Eusapia was\nalso, as I understand the account, at that end of the small table which\nwas nearest to the round table.\nFurther, some one may have suggested the round table and the\nsuggestion may have been negatived by Eusapia, although no mention\nof this appears in the report. Mistakes of this kind are demonstrably\nmade in reports of events such as we are considering. (Journal\nS. P. R., Vol. II., pp. 420-1.)\n\" R. selected large table, and asked for cross in red. E. said\ndoubtful, and drew with M.'s finger on R.'s hand an irregular figure\nfeeling like a circle with a knot attached.\" This was under 11.43.\nUnder 12.4 we read : \" M. and L. each holding one of E.'s hands\nfirmly in the air, R.'s hand was strongly grasped and held as by a\nhand while 31 was counted.\"\nOnce more, how was this holding 1\nFurther, were the \" hands \" held in the air at the suggestion\nof Eusapia (or the \" control \") 1 It is to be inferred that R.'s hand\nwas not \" grasped and held as by a hand \" until after Eusapia's\n\" hands \" were held in the air. I suppose, of course, that M. and L.\nwere \" holding \" to one and the same hand of Eusapia, and the raising\nof this in the air might have made it easier for Eusapia to reach for\nward with the other hand and grasp Richet, returning it to the\n\" holding \" as soon as she felt that the \" holders \" were beginning to\nexplore too much.\nLater on we come to the examination of the large table :\n' ' A light was now struck, and the under surface of table (now turned\nupwards), was examined for marks. Nothing was found\nexcept joiners' lines which had been there before. The table\nwas now half raised, so that its legs were horizontal, and its\nupper surface shewed at once a large blue scrawl of this\nshape.\n\" No cross was found [such as had been asked for above].\n\"There was now full light and the seance was understood to have stopped.\nBut E. asked for a blue pencil, and when one was found and given her\nshe proceeded to cover the tip of her fore-finger with blue chalk. She then\ngave this finger to R. to hold, and with it extended she walked up to the\nvertically-standing top surface of the large table, and made near, but not\ntouching it, a couple of quick cross marks in the air. The blue had then\ndisappeared from hnr finger, and two large blue crosses, sharply drawn, not\n\f46 Dr. Hodgson. MAR.\u2014APR., 1395.\nas with finger tip, were found at the back or far side of the table, viz., on\none of the sideboards of the under side which had been just previously\nexamined for such marks. There was no fresh mark on the surface in front\nof which she had made the gestures.\"\nThe explanation of the \" two large blue crosses \" incident is simple\nenough. These tricks remind me of the figures Mr. Davey used to\ndraw on his slate under the eyes of the sitters, (vid. Proc. S. P. R.,\nVol. VIII. pp. 274-275.)\nIn the interim, perhaps when the sitters were gazing at the\nmysterious scrawl on the upper surface of the table, Eusapia made the\ncrosses on the other side. After having covered the tip of her forefinger\nwith the blue chalk she rubbed it off by a quick movement, possibly\nagainst her dress (a spot on which she may have just moistened for\nthe purpose) and either before or after giving her finger to R. to hold.\nShe may even have chalked the tip of one finger and given another\nfinger to R. to hold. Here again, we are not told any details 'of the\nholding. The evidence is far from good enough to show that she\nactually did cover the tip of her forefinger (we are not told whether it\nwas believed to be the right or the left forefinger) with chalk, whether\nthis tip was still seen to be covered with chalk immediately prior to her\nmaking the cross marks in the air\u2014whether it was found to be free from\nchalk immediately after the making of those cross marks and before\nrelease of her finger by R.\u2014whether her finger was held by R. so that\nshe could not have rubbed the chalk off by ordinary means during that\nbrief interval.\nThe blue crosses were found \" on one of the sideboards of the\nunder side which had been just previously examined for such marks.\"\nNow I shall assume that the \"just previously examined\" refers to the\nsearch which had been made on the under surface of the table before\nthe upper surface was examined. Since that search of the under surface\nthe upper surface was examined and the blue scrawl found, and doubt\nless a certain amount of attention was given to this scrawl by all the\nsitters, none of whom I suppose was watching Eusapia and taking care\nthat she should not approach the table. Again, we find the\nexpressions \" a light was now struck \" and (later on) \" There was\nnow full light.\" Probably after the finding of the scrawl more light\nwas added to the light that was struck. Anyway \" the seance was\nunderstood to have stopped,\" and probably a few minutes at least\nelapsed after the examination of the under surface of the table, before\n\" E. asked for a blue pencil,\" and as there is no specific statement\nabout any but the original examination of the under surface of the\ntable, and not a word about any observation kept on the movements\nof Eusapia during this interval which I suppose to be of at least a few\nminutes, it can hardly be maintained that Eusapia did not make the\ncrosses herself surreptitiously by ordinary means. The whole incident\nseems to me to be eminently suggestive of a trick. So also does the\n\" scrawl \" incident ; and I draw special attention to them although the\nreporters apparently do not wish to put them forward as having much\nevidential value.\n\fMAR.\u2014APR., 1895.] Evidence in Case of Eusapia Paladino. 47\nNo claim seems to be made that the other objects that were moved\nafter the resumption of the seance were beyond Eusapia's reach. The\n\" saucer containing small shot \" is said parenthetically to be \" from\nanother part of the room,\" but we are not told how far away it had\nbeen, and, moreover, even if it had been at the remotest point of the\nroom from Eusapia at the beginning of the seance, she may have\nmoved it nearer surreptitiously during the interim between the two\ndivisions of the seance.\nThe other incident that needs special mention is the last, viz :\u2014\n\" During the latter half of the sitting, E. had taken one of M.'s fingers\nand drawn some scrawls with it outside R. 's flannel jacket, which was\nbuttoned up to his neck. M. said : ' She is using me to write on you,' and\nit was thought no more of. But after the seance, when undressing, R.\nfound on his shirt front, underneath both flannel jacket and high white\nwaistcoat, a clear blue scrawl, and came at once to bedrooms to show it.\"\nThis scrawl might of course have been made by Eusapia surrepti\ntiously on the shirt front at a previous time when Richet was not wearing\nit, and he may not have noticed it when he put the shirt on. Or she\nmay have made it while professing to use M.'s fingers, and pressing\nthem against Richet's jacket she may have slipped a finger of her own\nbetween the buttons of his jacket and of his waistcoat if we are to\nassume that his waistcoat also was buttoned, and made the scrawl then.\nOr, as I think more probable, she may have made the scrawl a little\nearlier. The overt incident is said to have occurred \" during the latter\nhalf of the sitting,\" and R. was apparently in close proximity to\nEusapia during most of this time,\u2014\" holding \" both of E.'s arms and\none hand, or both knees and one hand, or head and right hand, or\nhead and body. And if we remember pickpockets, and E.'s spasmodic\nmovements, we shall hardly see any difficulty in the supposition that\nE. found an opportunity to make the scrawl without R.'s knowledge.\nThe accounts of the remaining sittings are unfortunately still less\ndetailed than that of the first, and there is therefore more room for\nconjecture as to the real series of events. It is to be regretted that\nProfessor Lodge did not give us also a more detailed account of the\ncircumstances when Eusapia was \" probably experimenting in her way\non whether she too cannot do the things she has heard talked about\nfor years.\" (.Journal S. P. R. for November, p. 323).\nIncidents regarded by Professor Lodge as of little importance or\ntoo trivial to be mentioned might convey to others clear indications of\nEusapia's modi operandi. And when I read that \" Eusapia herself in\nher ordinary state is not averse to exhibiting things which she seems\nto consider just as good as those which are accomplished while she is\nunconscious,\" I look for something more about these things than is con\ntained in the illustration given in the next paragraph :\n\" One afternoon she began, with me alone, to jig a table about and cause\nliquid in a jar to shake ; others came in and took part in the procedure, and\npresently the light table was lifted for an instant from the floor ; but the\nwhole thing was wearisome and quite unlike the genuine phenomenon. The\nmovements were such as anyone could produce, and a momentary raising of\n\f48 Dr. Hodgson. [MAR.\u2014APR., 189&.\nthe table could be effected in her then position without serious difficulty.\"\u2014\nJournal S.P.R. for November, pp. 322\u20143.\nOn such occasions as these Eusapia may be \" in bad form\" or \" off\nher guard,\" and a full knowledge of her \" tricks \" at these times may\nlead up to a full knowledge of her tricks at other times when they are\nharder to detect. Or she may have acted clumsily on purpose, just to\nshow the investigators how little she could accomplish herself.\nI may here say a few words about the method of drawing up the\nreport (Journal for November, pp. 307, 336-7.) It appears that it was\nProfessor Richet who generally dictated to the note-taker outside,\nbut sometimes it was one of the other sitters. We are not told\nwhether any details about circumstances that appeared suspicious at\nthe time were dictated in this way. Perhaps not, In any case it\nwas of course wise to have some record, even if only a skeleton outline,\nso to speak, of the series of events occurring at the sitting. This con\ntemporaneous record was doubtless of great service in excluding some\nkinds of error from the final report. But starting from this as a basis, I\nshould like to have seen complete records of all these sittings drawn up\nby all the sitters independently, before they made comparisons with\neach other as to what actually occurred,\u2014and alongside of these reports\nI should like to have a copy of the original notes themselves as taken\ndown at the time from dictation. It will be remembered that when\ndifferent independent accounts were given of Eglinton's performances,\nthere were striking discrepancies in the accounts,\u2014a circumstance of\nessential importance for the trick being sometimes found mentioned in\none account though absent from the other. (Journal S.P.R., Vol. II.,\npp. 417 el seq., 461 et seq.) And of course it may well be further that\nwhat one of the sitters dictated during the sitting might be in conflict\nwith the impressions of another sitter. Quot homines, tot sententice,\neven in the records of direct observation.\nTurning now to the details given of the Second Sitting we find\nthat \" a selection of the events only is quoted,\" and the accounts of\nthese are very meagre, I mean the accounts of what is important.\nThe electric apparatus is referred to again, and I may add here that\nit would be desirable to have some detailed considerations from Pro\nfessor Lodge about the possibility or otherwise of Eusapia's keeping:\none or other or both of these pedals depressed in some other way than\nby her feet. For all that I know, a tack or a wedge that might be\nplaced by the fingers might have served the purpose. Whether such a.\nsupposition is absurd or not I have no means of determining from any\nthing that appears in the report.\nWe are told that Eusapia's hands '\u2022 were wide apart and held quite\ndistinctly, the left by L. and the right by M.\" from which I suppose it\nwould be an injustice to infer that on various other occasions of \" hold\ning \" they were not wide apart and were not held quite distinctly. Be\nthat as it may, in the absence of any details of \" holding,\" I shall\nassume that Eusapia got one hand free. Various kinds of spasmodic\nmovements of Eusapia probably occurred, twitchings of her body,\n\fMAR.-APR., 1895.] Evidence in Case of Eusapia Paladino. 49\n&c., during which it may have been quite easy for her to get one hand\nfree occasionally. Sometimes her \" hands \" may have been \" wide\napart,\" sometimes not,\u2014and the sitters might easily make mistakes as\nto the precise moments when they were \" wide apart.\"\nWhen \" a couple of loud claps, as of free hands in the air, were\nheard,\" I suppose that Eusapia was slapping her cheek or her fore\nhead or some other part of her body with her freed hand. This is an\nold \" mediumistic \" trick, in one of the forms of which the \"proof\"\nthat the medium had both hands engaged was regarded as established\nby the continual sound (as) of her clapping of hands together.\nHere, as in the previous sitting, I need not specify all the events\nwhich I suppose can be accounted for by the action of mouth, &c., or\nfreed hand or foot of the medium, where the precise details of the\n\" holding \" of these are not given, and we can suppose that Eusapia\nmight have made one hand or foot do duty for two, and where she\nmight have used a dummy hand or foot. Any events which may seem\nto present a special difficulty I shall refer to particularly. \"L.'s head\nwas now seized and forcibly squeezed and shaken, as if by two strong\nhands or stumps.\" The paragraph in which this sentence occurs is\nmore or less obscure as to how much was seen by the witnesses. Shortly\nafter the above sentence we learn that \" Eusapia's hands were well\nheld, and the position of her head and mouth observed \"\u2014from\nwhich I infer that her head was seen more or less dimly. But\nit might well be that this \" position \" was not seen at this stage of the\nperformance, but at a later stage,\u2014suggesting a kind of error in re\ncording of which there are examples in the reports of sittings with\nMr. Davey. The double pressure on L.'s head may have been produced\nby Eusapia's one hand and elbow or by the fingers separated from the\nthumb part of the hand so that the palm did not touch the top of his\nhead,\u2014or by a special forceps-like instrument which may have been\nserviceable for elongating Eusapia's reach towards other objects.\nI presume that the chdlet could be wound up with one hand, and I\nsuppose that if necessary Eusapia could have held the chdlet as a\nwhole still, for the purpose of winding, by the pressure of some other\npart of her body.\n\" R. held head and left hand and left foot of E.\" I wonder how !\u2014\nWas the chain of hands complete round the circle 1\nThe next incident that needs special mention is the raising of the\nsquare table. (Even supposing that Eusapia's hands were properly\nheld, the \" strong slap on the back \" which M. felt might have come\nfrom Eusapia's foot.)\nProfessor Lodge makes the following statement about the raising of\nthe table :\u2014\n\"It appears to me impossible for any person to lift a table of this size\nand weight while standing up to it, with hands only on top, without plenty\nof leg action, and considerable strength and pressure of hands. It was\nquite beyond any normal power of Eusapia.\"\nNow let us suppose that Eusapia used a form of support which\nwith some variation or other, I fancy is not altogether unknown in\n\f50 Dr. Hodgson. IMAR.-APR., 1395.\nthe Italian race. Let us suppose that she had, next to her body, a\nlight strong band round her shoulders and across her chest, with a\npendant attached of a black band or cord with a hook or other catch at\nthe end which could be tucked out of sight in her dress front when not\nin use. (By the way, in a photograph which I have seen of Eusapia\nat a sitting, when a table is supposed to be completely off the floor, one\nof the buttons of the bosom of her dress seems to be unfastened.)\nShe affixed this catch,\u2014either stooping or bending her legs slightly\noutward,\u2014to one of the \" sideboards \" of the table or to some point in\nthe neighbourhood of the junctures of, e.g., sideboards and top of table.\nShe straightened herself out, stiffened her shoulders and her body back,\n\u2014and pushed forward with her foot against the leg of the table close to\nwhich she was standing. The light touch of one of her hands may have\nhelped to steady the table,\u2014the edge of which may also have been in\ncontact with her body. Was this hypothesis or any kindred hypothesis\ntested by Professor lodge ? Was any precaution taken by Professor\nLodge to prevent the use of any such simple apparatus or to detect its\nexistence ? I have not such a table at hand as that used, and cannot\ntherefore make experiments just now. But the various possibilities of\nraising such tables ought to have been considered in detail by Professor\nLodge. Perhaps however I am doing him an injustice, and he has con\nsidered the above and allied hypotheses, but if so, I maintain that he\nought to have discussed them in his report, somewhere or other ; that\nhe has not done so suggests that he has overlooked them.\nWe come now to the Third Sitting.\nThe diagram in illustration at the beginning of this is evidently\nnot intended to be drawn to scale, so that I cannot infer anything as\nto the exact measurements from point to point.\nWe are told that the lowest point of the chdlet was five feet from\nthe floor. This, I take it, since Professor Lodge is accustomed to\nexact scientific experiment, and did not use the phrase \" about five\nfeet,\" means that he measured the distance,\u2014and perhaps purposely\narranged that the lowest point of the chalet was just five feet from\nthe floor by careful measurement. He tells us that it hung at a\ndistance \" distinctly beyond Eusapia's normal reach ; at least two feet\nbeyond.\" Now I should like to know the precise measurements by\nwhich Professor Lodge ascertained this, when these measurements\nwere made, how Eusapia was sitting (or standing) at the time, and so\nforth. After he made these measurements, the small table and\nEusapia's chair may have been moved considerably nearer the chalet,\nso that what was beyond Eusapia's \"normal reach \" at the beginning\nof the sitting may have been well within her \" normal reach \" when\nthe chalet was first disturbed. The report of this sitting, like the\nreports of the two preceding sittings, gives accounts of events in a\ngeneral way which have no interest whatever unless we know more in\ndetail about the conditions under which they occurred.\nWe are told about an \" uncertain \" experiment with \" halma men \"\n\fMAR.-APR., 1895.] Evidence in Case of Eusapia Paladino. 51\nwithout learning who suggested the \" experiment.\" Similarly for the\n\" production of scent.\" Later on we read :\u2014\n\" He also let one of his hands he held by Eusapia's two hands, feeling\ndown her sleeves and having a light struck to assure himself that the holding\nwas correctly felt, and under these conditions a distinct hand was applied to\nhis right arm, and when he put his free (i.e., Ochorowicz-holding) hand to\nthe place it was gripped momentarily too, giving a clear feeling of nails and\nof thumb and fingers.\"\nWe are not told how Eusapia held him ; nothing is said of the\npossibilities of a false sleeve ; nor are we told at what part of his\nright arm he felt the \" distinct hand.\" We need not even infer that it\nwas Professor Lodge who asked to have a light struck \" to assure him\nself that the holding was correctly felt.\" It may have been Eusapia who\nsuggested this, and who nevertheless afterwards got one hand free. I\ncommented (long ago (Journal S. P. R., Vol. II,, p. 418, et seq.),\nupon the way in which witnesses refer to precautions, <kc., as though\nsuggested by themselves when they were in reality suggested by the\n\" medium.\"\nLater we read : \" The agency was asked to wind up the suspended\nchalet, but reported that it turned round [naturally] when the\nattempt was made.\" This suggests, of course, the remark that Eusapia\ncould reach the chalet with one hand, but could not wind it up unless\nshe could apply pressure to keep the chalet still, as she could not do,\n.at the first trial at least, while the chalet was suspended by the string,\nand was beyond the reach of any other part of her body.\nLater we find that : \" Eusapia now held both her hands on Lodge's\nhead, and Myers held both her knees.\" How she laid her hands on\nLodge's head, and how he knew they were there all the time, we are\nnot informed.\nLater we find the following description :\u2014\n\" While Lodge held both the medium's hands on the table, and also her\nhead leaning over on to him away from the chalet, (see figure above), and\nwhile Richet held both her feet, the suspended chalet was heard to be\nwound partially up 3 times, with brief pauses, taking four seconds in all,\nas heard and recorded by Bellier. It did not now begin to play, but began\nto flap, as if its doors were trying to open. Soon it began to play and raps\nwere heard on it. While it played Eusapia's hands waved L.'s hands in the\nair hi time with the music. It soon stopped, but was immediately re-wound\nand went on playing some time. While this was going on, the chalet began\nto swing and the string was heard to break, but instead of dropping on\nthe floor, the chalet was gently placed on M. 's head and thence on to the\ntable.\"\nNow we know that one of the mistakes to which a witness is liable\nis the transposition of events at a sitting. The witnesses may have\nheard the string break, but they may have heard it before the chalet\nbegan to be wound up and not after. Here is an instance where the\nrecord of the original dictated notes might be of service. This original\nrecord might establish that in the belief of the sitters at the time of\nthe occurrences the sound of winding preceded the sound of breaking of\nthe string. Nothing is said about any examination of the string after\n\f52 Dr. Hodgson. IMAR.-APR., i895:\nwards. For all that appears in the report the chalet might be wound\nup with one hand while still suspended from the string, and the\nstring might have really been broken at the point of time described in\nthe report.\nThe next statement that calls for any special comment is: \" Observa\ntion made in light as to correct holding of Eusapia's hands.\" Who\nsuggested this observation does not appear, but one advantage of the\n\" making one hand do duty for two \" is just the fact that the freed\nhand can come back at once. This is precisely the kind of observation\nthat I should ask to be made were I doing a similar trick myself.\nFinally we read :\u2014\n\" After the sitting there occurred a curious writing episode, in which the\nclean finger nail of Professor Richet, held by Eusapia, was made to act as a\nblue crayon and to leave a thick blue pencil mark when drawn thus along\nwhite paper in full candle light. This was done several times, and the\nformation of the last two of these marks was closely watched by all in the\nlight close to a candle. It appeared to L. as if the blue did not appear\ndirectly under the nail, but slightly on one side, as if some invisible\nprotrusion from the fingers of Eusapia (which themselves were about half\nan inch off the paper) were really producing it, but he does not vouch for\nthis detail and only records it as a memorandum for future observation.\n[The paper was certainly clean beforehand, and the marks could be seen\nbeing formed.]\"\nHow, in detail, was Professor Richet's finger nail held by Eusapia ?\nWhat examination was made of Eusapia's hand or hands immediately\nbefore and after the episode ? How does Professor Lodge know that a\npiece of \" blue crayon \" was not held surreptitiously by Eusapia and\nconcealed from view by her own fingers or those of Richet 1 About\nsuch points as these, the really important points of the \" curious writ\ning episode,\"\u2014not a word ! If done as I suggest, it was a natural\nenough illusion for the witnesses to think that they saw the marks\n\" being formed.\" I venture to think, however, that this is just what\nthey did not see, and that what they did see was the marks coming\ninto view just after they were formed. Another incident very like a\nconjuring trick.\nProceeding to the account of the Fourth Sitting, we find that the\nreport becomes still more lax. Several '\u2022 phenomenal \" incidents are\nrecounted before we read : \" Eusapia was well held, and all conditions\nperfect.\"\nWhen and exactly how were the distances measured between\nEusapia and the objects moved ? What evidence is there that the\ncurtain was untouched by ordinary means by Eusapia ? Why wasn't\nthe \"large face or mask \" really a \"mask\" held up by Eusapia and\nprojected against the window ? But, indeed, there is no need to suppose\nany more than that Eusapia was moving the curtain about with\npossibly an imitation hand possibly at the end of a rod. We learn\nthat \" there was so much locomotion in this seance that it is useless to\ngive a plan.\" What about the various measurements 1 I am not at\nall sure that Eusapia could not have got at the key with a freed hand ;\nthough she may have had to use some attachment, carried about with\n\fMAR.-APR., 1895.] Evidence in Case of Eusapia Paladino. 53\nher for the purpose of \" elongating her reach.\" We read about a\n\" fair light,\" \" very visible,\" \" plainly enough visible,\" and learn that\n\" there was light enough to see the position of everybody's normal\nhands all the time on this occasion [the key incident], and we were\nsitting some four or five feet distant from the door.\" Who, as a matter\nof fact, did see Eusapia's normal hands during this incident ? Was the\nlight enough to distinguish a normal hand from a dummy hand 1 WJio\nwas four or five feet distant from the door ? How far was the end of\nthe key beyond Eusapia's possible reach ? What were the positions of\nthe sitters ? Who was holding Eusapia and how ? Why could she\nnot have managed this phenomenon quite easily with her foot ?\nThe last incident mentioned is the following :\u2014\n\" Medium now conducted the standing group to near the writing desk\nin the corner, and made three little movements with her held hand. They\nseemed to take effect and tilt the desk backwards, after a very short but\nappreciable interval. Then she moved further away and repeated the\naction ; the same movement of the bureau occurred, but with more delay.\nThen once more, this time two metres from the desk ; and the interval\nelapsing before the response was now greater, perhaps as much as two\nseconds.\"\nWhether Eusapia could have \" fixed \" the desk before with threads\nor a cord or not does not appear. Whether she \" fixed \" it at the time\ndoes not appear. Mr. Davey, in a bright light and under the eyes of\nseveral witnesses, could arrange a thread so that chalks resting on a\nslate and covered by an inverted tumbler would be moved away from\nhim (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., p. 275).\nThe account speaks of her \" held hand.\" Presumably therefore\none of Eusapia's hands was not even imagined by the witnesses to be\nheld. What was it doing ; and what had it done?\nProfessor Lodge says in his preliminary remarks :\u2014\" I had a\nhoop ready to pass over her body when some continuous distant action\nwas going on, to see if anything would be intercepted, but I found no\nconvenient opportunity for performing the experiment.\" That last\nincident of the Fourth Sitting might have been a good time,\u2014but then\nthe cord might have been close to the floor.\nIt remains to make a few remarks about the statements made at\nthe meeting as recorded in the Journal. Mr. Myers gives a more\ndetailed account (Journal S.P.R. for November, p. 337) of an incident\nwhich is referred to briefly in the report ; but, as in the report gene\nrally, we are not informed in any way precisely how E.'s hands were\nheld,\u2014 so that I may assume that one hand was free, in which case\nwhat Mr. Myers \" felt \" could easily enough have been produced by knee,\nhand (or fist),and elbow of Eusapia. Even withoutthe hand,it would have\nbeen easy enough to produce what is described by knee, foot and head,\n\u2014the head being applied to the near side of Mr. Myers, the knee in the\nsmall of the back, and the foot to the remoter side,\u2014and this would\nrather fit Mr. Myers' description, for which in any case we must allow\na margin for exaggeration or illusion, even if we suppose that his\n\fDr. Hodgson. [MAR.\u2014APR., iss5.\naccount of the three simultaneous pressures is to be taken as exact.\nMoreover the force suggested by the pressure of the knee in this way\nappears considerable, and hence probably Mr. Myers' impression \" at the\ntime \" that it was greater than his own. Where there is some inde-\ndendent means of judging what force was actually used on different occa\nsions, as by lifting of tables, change of weight on scales, etc., it is per\nfectly clear, as I venture to think,that there is no indication of any force\nused in the sittings which need be regarded as beyond that possessed\nby a woman of Eusapia's \" make-up,\" if we except the dynamometer\nincident mentioned in Professor Lodge's Introduction.\nMr. Myers refers to another incident which is not mentioned in\nProfessor Lodge's report at all, and he states that he \" clearly witnessed\nobjects poised and moving with no material hand or attachment.\" The\nstatement which he quotes from the notes is more careful : \" M. saw\nno hand touching it.\" This is a very different matter. I have seen\nlots of objects move about at conjurers' entertainments where \/ saw\n\" no material hand or attachment,\"\u2014and when the light was far more\nthan prevailed at the sitting referred to, although on the other hand\nthe distances were greater. Mr. Davey in brilliant light could use a\nthread \" right under the eyes\" of the witness without being detected,\nand I venture to think that Mr. Myers' opinion, that there could have\nbeen no attachment because he did not see one in the dim light which\nprevailed, cannot be regarded as valuable evidence that there was no\nattachment.\nMr. Myers then refers to the overturning of the large table at the\nfirst sitting. It is true that he does this with special reference to the\n\" collective hallucination hypothesis.\" But he seems to think that to\nexplain the phenomenon concerned by ordinary means, Eusapia, \" in\nstead of sitting between us, as we supposed, must have got up and left\nthe circle, passed behind me to overturn the table, and returned and\ntaken our hands before the light was struck directly afterwards.\" I do\nnot see the necessity for any such supposition as this. I see no reason why\nEusapia could not have overturned the table with one freed hand, as I\nhave suggested in my previous comment on this incident. Mr. Myers\nfurther says, with reference to the supposition of a dummy hand : \" It\nwould however be difficult to train a stuffed hand to perspire naturally,\nto mark time to an accordion, and to clench one's palm with its nails ;\nall which the small hand which I grasped undoubtedly did.\" The\naccordion may have been played (i.e. single notes sounded, vide the\nReport,Journal for November, p. 350) by Eusapia's foot. The accordion\ndid not play apparently until after it got on to the floor.\nThe statements of Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick at the meeting, as\nreported in the Journal for November, do not of course refer to the four\nsittings reported by Professor Lodge, at which they were not present,\nand they do not include any detailed statements as to precisely what\nhappened at their sittings under detailed conditions of holding. I\nneed hardly say that I shall look with very profound interest for the\ndetailed reports by them of the sittings at which they were present.\nIn the meantime I draw special attention to the fact that Mrs. Sidg\n\fMAB.\u2014APR., 1895.] Reply to Dr. Hodgson. 55\n\u2022wick says that, as far as her own experiences go, the evidence \" entirely\ndepends on whether her [Eusapia's] hands were efficiently held \" ; and I\nremind the reader that we are nowhere in the Report (nor in the addi\ntional speeches) given any information as the precise methods of\nholding both hands on any particular occasion.\nREPLY TO DR. HODGSON.\nBY F. W. H. MYERS.\nI have obtained permission from Professor Lodge to make a general\nreply in his name as well as my own to the searching criticism which\nDr. Hodgson has bestowed upon our evidence as to Eusapia Paladino,\nas contained in Professor Lodge's Report, my own speech as reported\nin the Journal for November, 1894, and the extracts thus far printed\nfrom the notes compiled at the time by Professor Lodge and myself,\nand approved by Professors Richet and Ochorowicz.\nMy principal reason for wishing to undertake this task is that the\nquestions at issue seem to me to lie less directly between Professor\nLodge and the scientific world than between Dr. Hodgson and myself.\nFor the objections are virtually directed against the brevity of the\nnotes taken on the island; a brevity for which I am as fully responsible\nas Professor Lodge. And, moreover, the omissions complained of are\nlargely of a technical character, involving defects in testimony, not as\ntestimony is ordinarily given by competent witnesses, but as a certain\ngroup of enquirers in the S.P.R. itself\u2014of whom I have been one\u2014\nhave demanded that it should be given when certain special phenomena\nare being described. I entirely adhere to the canons of evidence\nwhich I myself, as well as Dr. Hodgson, have been concerned in\nestablishing ; and I feel that some explanation is due from me to him, or\nto any other colleague who cares to demand it, for certain deviations from\nthose canons in the evidence before us. With Professor Lodge the case\nstands somewhat differently ; and he has dealt with such special\npoints as he wished to notice in an appendix to this paper. In ex\nplaining how the above-mentioned deviations came to be made, I hope\nto show that Dr. Hodgson's criticisms do not in any wise affect our own\nconviction, and need not, in our view, affect any conviction felt by our\nreaders, as to the genuineness of the phenomena described.\nSome remarks by Professor Richet and Dr. Ochorowicz will be\nfound below.\nThe gist of Dr. Hodgson's paper lies in a strong insistance that the\nway in which Eusapia's hands were held should have been more fully\ndescribed, and that the absence of such description entitles him to\nassume that she could habitually have got at least one hand free, by\ncausing Professor Lodge and myself to hold each other's hands, or\nboth of us to hold the same hand of her own. He then urges that\n\f56 F. W. H. Myers. [MAH.\u2014APH., 1895.\nwith one hand free (and perhaps a foot also, as to which I will\nspeak separately), Eusapia could have performed all the described\nphenomena.\nI have therefore three points to answer. (1) Is the hand-holding\nproperly described ? (2) Could she in fact have got a hand or hands\nfree? (3) If so, could she have produced the phenomena 1\nIn reply to the first question I admit that a fuller description\nwould have been desirable, as is indeed shown by the very fact that so\ncompetent a critic as Dr. Hodgson feels our record to be inadequate ;\nbut I would point out that the defects were not due, as he seems to\nimply, to previous ignorance or present negligence as to hand-holding\non our part, but rather to a mistaken assumption that certain pre\nliminary statements, obvious to ourselves, would be taken for granted\nby the reader also ; and to an over-estimation of the degree of confidence\nwhich would be placed in the brief, but carefully-weighed, assertions\nmade by ourselves as to our observations.\nTo the second question I reply that it continues to be the serious and\ncomplete conviction of all of us, Lodge, Richet, Ochorowicz, and myself,\nthat on no single occasion during the occurrence of an event recorded by\nus was a hand of Eusapia's free to execute any trick whatever, and that\nwe claim the belief of others for this fact on the ground that we were\nall of us completely familiar, either by experience or by instruction,\nwith the hand-tricks as described by Dr. Hodgson, and were expressly,\nintently, and concordantly engaged throughout in rendering those tricks\nimpossible. I shall point out also that this task was a much easier one\nthan Dr. Hodgson appears to assume ; and especially that so far as the\nessential point\u2014viz., the fraudulent production of phenomena\u2014is con\ncerned, there was not even need for continuous attention (as he, in dis\nregard of Lodge's words on p. 315, assumes that there was), inasmuch\nas we received distinct warnings when any marked phenomenon was\nabout to occur ; sufficiently before its occurrence to exalt our watchful\nness to its highest point.\nTo the third question I reply that even assuming that Eusapia had\nhad a hand or a foot, or both hands or both feet, free, she most\ncertainly could not have caused certain phenomena without getting\nup and leaving her place between us. I repeat that (for instance)\nthe raisings, movings, and overturnings of the 481b. table behind my\nback, but in view of Professor Ochorowicz,\u2014my person and a space of at\nleast four feet intervening between the medium and the nearest part of\nthat large table\u2014constituted such a case. Eusapia had had no access\nto that large table since she entered the room and sat down at once at\nthe small one, with myself, as I say, between her and the large one,\nand in a light in which her movements could be distinctly seen. That\nshe could have acted in such a manner upon a table of that weight\nand in that place while sitting dimly visible and quiet, jammed between\nProfessor Lodge and myself, was, I must repeat, a thing im\npossible. This is in fact just one of the cases, to which I shall elsewhere\nhave to allude, where an occurrence which is very simple to observe\nmay be very complex to describe ;\u2014and where no description can\n\fMAR.\u2014APR., les5.] Reply to Dr. Hodgson. 57\nreally be as valuable as the clear conviction at the moment of persons\nfully warned and carefully watching.\nBut now let me go at once to the root of the matter. The following\nsentences,\u2014expressly indicating our sense of the importance of the fact\nthat absolutely continuous attention throughout the whole of the sit\ntings was not essential to our observation of the phenomena;\u2014-the follow\ning sentences, I say, which were written after the first seance, and left\nby us unmodified throughout as applying to all the seances, contain an\nexact and deliberate statement of actual fact.\n\" There was not,\" we say, \" the slightest attempt made on her part\nto struggle out of control. On the contrary, before any special exer\ntion of power she usually requested attention to the hands, feet, knees,\nand often head ; and a definite report as to their position and security.\nThere was often a twitching of the body and spasmodic pressure of\nthe fingers, but never sufficient to cause loss of control.\"*\nTo these statements we absolutely adhere. We were all of us\nfamiliar with the possible jugglings with hands which Dr. Hodgson\ndescribes ; and when thus warned before some phenomenon took place,\nand very often when not so warned, we described to each other, and\nfrequently showed to each other by holding up Eusapia's held hands,!\nthat our grasp was complete and satisfactory. When we said \" Mains\nbien tenues,\" we meant that the hands were well grasped across palm\nand four fingers at least, the thumb also being frequently included. I\ngenerally held Eusapia's hand supinated ; that is, with its palm up\nwards, and meeting my palm ; and when so held her sharp nails were\nhabitually pressed with slight twitching movements into my palm.\nWhen I held her hand pronated, that is, with my palm or fingers\nover the backs of her fingers, her finger-tips may have projected about\nhalf an inch beyond my grasp. Sitting extremely close to her, I was\nin frequent contact with her whole arm as well, apart from occasions\n\u2022when I am expressly recorded as securing the whole arm. It is\nimpossible that Professor Lodge should have been holding the same\nhand without my observing it. If his hand had been grasping hers\nthere would have been no room for mine.\nBut, it is said, I may have been thus grasping a hand not Eusapia's ;\na hand, therefore, which in almost all cases must have been that of\nLodge, from our relative positions. Now Lodge, whom I think Hodgson\nhas only once met, is a very tall and very powerfully built man (six feet\ntwo and a-half inches in height), and his hands are massive, cool, firm,\nand muscular. My own hand is not large enough to grip Lodge's in the\nsame way that I gripped Eusapia's, and to suppose that I could mis\n* So, for instance, in notes of the first seance 11.10, \"M. distinctly pinched as by\nfive fingers, one after the other touching, and then all pinching simultaneously.\nEusapia had predicted this by making movement with her hand on the hand of M.,\nand saying 1,2,3,4,5 ;\u2014 the idea being that she is indicating what is going to be done,\nand makes the prediction to call attention to it.\"\n+ When we speak of Eusapia's \" held hands \" or \" held hand \" we certainly do not\nmean, as Dr. Hodgson in one place assumes us to mean, that she had other hands\nunhdd. What we mean is \" with hands, or a hand, which was held.\" Surely this is\nordinary grammar enough !\n\f58 F. W. H. Myers. [MAR.-APR., isa5.\ntake my friend's massive, steady, round-nailed hand for the small, per\nspiring, quivering, sharp-nailed hand of the Neapolitan woman appears\nto me a hypothesis only a little less desperate than to suppose that I\nmistook a gloved and stuffed hand for that very living extremity which\nfingered the palm of my own hand, or spasmodically squeezed it, for so\nmany hours.\nIn saying this I am by no means wishing to make light of\nthe difficulties in holding Eusapia's hands firmly which other observers\nhave experienced. I hear that it frequently happens, when \" the\npower is weak,\" that she prefers to hold or touch the observer's hand,\nrather than to let her own be grasped. But it so chanced that the\nseances with Lodge and myself were (in the experienced view of\nRichet and Ochorowicz) probably about the best ever held with\nEusapia since she has been observed by scientific persons. For\nmyself, I experienced only just so much of the unwillingness to\nallow my grasp as enabled me to realise the truth of the description\ngiven by others. On one or two occasions only\u2014and not while any\nphenomena were going on\u2014she put her hand lightly on the back of\nmine instead of giving it to me to hold (John each time apologising\nand asking permission) ; and once\u2014I think once only\u2014I missed\nthe hand for a moment, instantly called out \"j'ai perdu la main ! \"\nand recovered it almost before I had finished speaking,\u2014nothing\nhaving occurred meantime. This was my sole moment of diffi\nculty, if difficulty it could be called. And indeed I think that\nDr. Hodgson's description of hand-jugglings gives a misleading\nimpression of the difficulty of meeting them. I remember indeed that\nin the years 1873-4, when holding the hands of a large male impostor,\nwith some stranger on the impostor's other side, I have felt myself hard\nput to it to keep a good grip of the big violently jerking hand : but\nthere was no such difficulty in this case ; in fact, as already said, the\nhand, under \"John's \" control, thrust itself hard against mine, and the\narm and knee and often the head of their own accord pressed\nagainst mine just when it was important to have them under due con\ntrol. If I myself had been animating Eusapia's body I could hardly\nhave made its actions and positions more subservient to the interests of\nour research. And here a word as to the control of the medium's feet.\nWhile they were on the electrical apparatus we frequently tested it,\nmaking sure that a raising of the medium's feet was followed by a.\nringing of the bell. It sometimes happened that some violent motion\nor fall of some object might disarrange the connexions, but the defect\nwas quickly detected. Eusapia's shoes had been removed lest they\nmight be used to jam the pedal down, and a leaden foot could not\nhave escaped detection. However, that apparatus was little used\nand the question is mainly as to control of her feet when free from it.\nNow, as dummy feet have been suggested, I may here say that whereas\nin the notes of the first seance I am described as wearing soft slippers,\nin the later seances\u2014in the interest of Science !\u2014I discarded even these,\nand exercised, with the intervention only of silk socks, the faculties\nwhich I inherit from a prehensile and quadrumanous ancestry. I\n\fMAR.\u2014APR., 1895.] Reply to Dr. Hodgson. 591\nfeel as sure about the feet guaranteed by me as about the hands ;\u2014\neven supposing that, if not held, a foot could manage to press one\nbetween the shoulders or on the head with a sensation as of five large\nseparate fingers, and wind up with a series of smart and sounding\nslaps on the back.*\nOf all this complex of satisfying incidents,\u2014so much easier to\nobserve than to describe,\u2014we endeavoured to give what we regarded,\nand still regard, as the most essential record ;\u2014namely, a series, so\nto say, of instantaneous photographs of our own unanimous convic\ntion at each critical moment. This conviction was the result\nin each case of a rapid survey or constatation of the actual\npositions,\u2014a direct appeal by one of us to each of the rest in\nturn as to satisfactory holding of each limb,\u2014with answers corro\nborated by gestures,\u2014as for instance the holding up in the air of the\nhand which each was grasping ; the light being in most cases quite\nadequate to show the lifted hands,\u2014and to show that the hand held\n(say) by Professor Lodge and that held by me were at a distance of one\nor two or three feet from each other ;\u2014abundantly enough to preclude\nthe supposition that we had both been holding the same hand, and that\nthe second hand had been surreptitiously slipped back into place. Some\ntimes (as recorded in each case) we struck a light in order to observe the\nposition of things (generally on Professor Richet's initiative, as he kept\nthe matches,\u2014never on Eusapia's), and in no case did the light reveal\nany mistake on our part as to the nature of the grasps which we had\nbelieved to exist. It would be well, no doubt, to arrange that such\nilluminations should be still more sudden ; but, as it was, all that was\nneeded between phenomenon and illumination was, say, half a minute\nof forewarned, earnest, quiescent attention.\nIt was, then, in this unique immediacy of record, combined with\nour own previous preparation for the task, that we deemed that the\nmain strength of our evidence lay. But was our own experience suf\nficient ? Had we a right to assume that our readers would give us\ncredit for knowing how to hold a human hand ? Let us consider each\nobserver in turn.\nIn the case, first, of Professor Richet, I shall, of course, appeal on\nmy side to every one of the passages which Dr. Hodgson has quoted\nfrom him as though against himself\u2014and to much else on the same lines\nwhich Professor Richet has written. It seems to me that Richet,\nif any man, has given proof, by cautious discussion of this very\npoint,\u2014by the formulation of these very requirements which Dr.\nHodgson cites with approval,\u2014by patient suspense of judgment and\nreiteration of experiments at Milan, at Rome, and for many weeks\ncontinuously upon this desert island selected and bought for the\npurpose, and in his own Chateau de Carqueiranne\u2014has given proof,\nI say, that when he affirms that a hand is well held he knows what he\nis saving ; that he is not duped by those elementary fallacies of which\n* During most of the second series of seances each foot was held separately by the\nhand of an observer under the table.\n\f60 F. W. H. Myers. [MAK.-APR., 1896.\nhe, on the Continent, as Dr. Hodgson for us, is himself the recognised\nexponent.\nOf Professor Ochorowicz much the same may be said. We hope to\npublish before long a translation from the Polish of his critical account\nand discussion of phenomena obtained by Eusapia during her stay of\nsome months under his observation at Warsaw: from which our readers\nwill judge of the degree of watchfulness and thoroughness which he\nhas used throughout an observation of Eusapia probably longer than\nthat made by any other savant. He is familiar with times when the\ncontrol is troublesome, the phenomena weak, and the movements of\nthe medium suspicious. He is familiar also with times when the con\nditions are really good, and doubt, as in our case, impossible. At\nWarsaw, I may here add, the personal search and scrutiny of the\nmedium, which Dr. Hodgson justly asks for, was made (I hear)\nwith satisfactory results.\nAs for Professor Lodge, he adds another to the list of savants,\nchosen originally as investigators for their skill and impartiality,\nwhose results, had they been negative results, no one would have ven\ntured to impugn. Less familiar, no doubt, with mediums and their\nways than the rest of us, he was at any rate sufficiently acquainted with\nthe whole hand-holding business, and he brought to the quest not only\nthose worldly reasons against avowed belief which, could they operate\nat all with men of that stamp, would have operated on Professor\nRichet too, but also an intellectual or scientific aversion to these\nseeming-random phenomena, which the rest of us had perhaps ceased\nto feel. He has spoken of his \" nausea at the reception of these un\npalatable facts \" ; and many readers I am sure, will sympathise\nwith this sensation. The rest of us, so to say, had already found our\nsea-legs. I cannot indeed credit myself personally with a refined dis\ngust at jumpings of tables and pullings of whiskers, and slaps on the\nback, offered in all their material grossness as proofs of a spiritual world.\nMy scheme of the universe (and very likely a black-beetle's scheme\nof the universe) can fit them in very well. I look on them as the inevit\nably gross and grotesque manifestations of the important law (as I hold\nit to be) that a human body's muscular force can, under certain guid\nance, be exercised at some distance from the body's apparent periphery.\nNeither, I think, did Professor Richet object to the facts. To him,\nindeed, no fact in nature can be theoretically objectionable or desirable,\nonly practically proved or unproved ; and his is the scientific temper\nwhich makes no scheme at all of the universe beforehand, but simply\ntries to find out piecemeal what the universe is. Professor Lodge, on\nthe other hand, although not quite so fully \" endowed with a knowledge\nof the naturally possible and impossible\" as to refuse to investigate these\nphenomena altogether, and although prepared by certain past experi\nences for strange surprises, would greatly have preferred that these\nsupernormal goings-on should confine themselves to the psychological\nregion alone, for which the Royal Society, so to say, would not hold him\npersonally responsible. Pressed by some evil genius to come and see\nEusapia, he would much have preferred to discover the whole thing to be\n\fMAR.\u2014APR., 1895.] Reply to Dr. Hodgson. 61\n. some curious variety of trance, not involving invisible fulcra, and action\nwhose reaction seems to lie in some imaginary world. If Dr. Hodgson\nhad witnessed Lodge's depression after that first convincing even\ning, he would have wondered that anyone\u2014like the classic boy with\nthe alphabet\u2014should have gone through so much to gain so little ;\u2014\nshould have gone through such an amount of semi-voluntary imbecility\nand almost calculated incompetence in order to gain his own glum\n\u2022 reflections, and the compassion of the scientific world.\nAnd lastly as to the fourth member of the group. Well ! I call the\nrat-catcher who visits my barn an expert ;\u2014not that I credit him with\nspecial rat-catching gifts, or even regard rat-catching as an art for which\nmany gifts are required ;\u2014but simply because he has been at it so long\nthat I cannot but think that he must know something about it by now.\nI too can say,\u2014and this is surely not a boast but a confession !\u2014that\nI have followed the business of \" sitter \" at seances,\u2014mostly with hand-\nholding as the occupation for such part of my energies as was not\noccupied in \" sitting,\"\u2014perhaps as assiduously as any man living. I\nknew all about these little hand-tricks twenty years ago, and I have\nshown them off to my friends until, in the poet's words,\u2014\" Until the\nthing almost became\u2014A bore.\" I blush to add that, even before the\nS.P.R. was founded, I had already 367 seances recorded in my note\nbook. If after all this practice I cannot yet be sure of holding my\nneighbour's hand, I had certainly better stop \" sitting,\"\u2014or at any\nrate take a back seat.\nAnd here I had written out an answer, point by point, to Dr.\nHodgson's detailed criticisms,\u2014giving exactly what I believed to be\nthe true details of each phenomenon. In most cases my memory\nseemed to supply me with a complete reply to his questions and\nstrictures ; but in some cases my memory was hazy ;\u2014 and alas ! I\nfelt how subtle was the temptation to make it seem a little more explicit\nthan it actually was. I will not expose myself to this temptation of\npainting up the photographs so instantaneously taken. I will not\neven point out all the places where Dr. Hodgson's description is\ninconsistent with what seems to me the plain\u2014and what is certainly\nthe true\u2014meaning of the words of the record. What I have already said\nin general will answer many of his points in detail. Take, for instance,\nSe'ance I., 12.4 A.M. \" M. and L. holding Eusapia's hands in air firmly,\nR.'s hand was firmly grasped and held by a hand like a right hand. It\nwas held for 31 seconds [i.e. while Richet slowly counted 31] and then\nlet go.\" Professor Lodge and I, then, were all this time both grasping\nEusapia's left hand in the air without discovering it, although expressly\nwarned by Professor Richet (before he began counting seconds) that he\nwas grasped by a right hand ! And one other matter there is which\nI do so specially remember that I must mention it here\u2014though Dr.\nHodgson will not be \" justified in assuming\"\u2014to use his favourite\nphrase\u2014that I have forgotten everything else !\nSpeaking of the hug round back and thighs which I experienced at\nour last seance, and described in my speech reported in the November\nJournal, Dr. Hodgson says :\u2014\n\f62 F. W. H. Myers. [MAR\u2014APR., 1895.\n\" Even without the hand, it would have been easy enough to pro\nduce what is described by knee, foot, and head ; the head being applied\nto the near side of Mr. Myers, the knee in the small of the\nback, and the foot to the remoter side ;\u2014and this would rather fit Mr.\nMyers' description, for which in any case we must allow a margin for\nexaggeration or illusion, even if we suppose his account of the three\nsimultaneous pressures is to be taken as exact.\"\nThe statement in the contemporary notes is as follows :\u2014\n\" M. was seized from behind as by a bear [a phrase which we used\nto intimate grasp without feel of distinct fingers] and compressed ; it\nturned him about and ultimately drew him violently away from L., who\neaw him moving and felt the transmitted pull. M. then felt as if a big\nman was kneeling behind him, seizing him round back and thighs, and\nshaking him vigorously. Embrace strong and lasting.\"\nWe were at this time (12.50) standing round the small table in close\nproximity. There was quite enough light to enable me to see her whole\nfigure well,\u2014as is shown by the fact the just preceding entry in the\nnotes relates to an object seen by all of us. I held Eusapia's\nhand, and was also more or less in contact all the time with\nher dress and person, owing to our standing so close together.\nBetween me and the buffet behind me was a space (as we\nafterwards computed) of a few inches only ; in fact I was standingjust\nclear of it. It would seem, then, that Eusapia, standing close to me, with\nher back against the bright strip of sky, one hand firmly held by\nme and the other by Professor Richet, and with Professor Lodge with\nin a few feet, was able, unperceived by me or by them, to\npress me with her head and knee and foot simultaneously on\nthe outsides of the thighs and in the small of the back, first\nwheeling me round and dragging me half a pace or so along\nthe floor,\u2014not by her hand, which remained passive in mine, but with\nthese other parts of her person ;\u2014and then shaking me violently from\nside to side and giving me, by these same means, a \" strong and lasting\nembrace \" around the region already described ;\u2014all in the space of a\nfew inches' width,\u2014and while I, for the twenty seconds or so that the\naffair lasted (I had time at least to describe it all both in French and\nEnglish) was loudly calling out to my companions what was going on.\nAll these actions of Eusapia's, of course, -may have been performed\nunnoticed under the very noses of Professors Richet and Lodge ;\nbut in that case I fear our inference must be that it is of no use to\nhave these phenomena investigated by anybody except by Dr.\nHodgson himself.\n\" Enough of this ! \" as Carlyle would have said, \" nay, much more\nthan enough!\" But, after all, the \"enginer, hoist with his own petar,\"\nmay reflect with satisfaction\u2014especially if he comes down again with\nno bones broken\u2014that it is a good thing that \" petars \" exist, and\neven that he has helped to make them. Dr. Hodgson\u2014to vary the\nmetaphor\u2014is struggling like Hercules with the Lerntean hydra of\never-reviving imposture ; it matters little if in the melee he gets his\n\fMAR.\u2014APR., 1895.] Reply to Dr. Hodgson. 63\nfaithful squire lolaus by the neck for a minute in mistake. And, to\nspeak out, my own past attitude with regard to Eusapia has been not\nvery different from Dr. Hodgson's present one. It is now some five or\nsix years since I was repeatedly and pressingly invited by friends living\nin Italy to come to them and see Eusapia under any conditions that\nI liked. My friends were far from being foolish persons ; but I did not\nregard them as experts ; I presumed that they had been taken in ; and\nI missed my opportunity. I then forgot all about Eusapia until I read\nsimultaneously some of the accounts by Italian savants, and Torelli's\narticles in the Milan Corriere, to which Dr. Hodgson above alludes. I\nwas convinced by Torelli that the thing must be a fraud ; I presumed\nthat the Italian savants, who were then only names to me\u2014as\nProfessors Lodge and Richet are now to Dr. Hodgson\u2014must have\nbeen grossly duped ; and I dissuaded a friend from taking the trouble\nto investigate the matter. It was only when Professor Richet began\nto verge towards conviction that I too was swayed. Knowing these\ntwo men, Professor Richet and Dr. Hodgson, so well as I do, I yet\nhardly know which of them in such matters I deem the acuter. Can\nI be wrong in thinking that Professor Richet's presence of mind at\na stance is a safer guide than Dr. Hodgson's absence of body ? At\nany rate I came when Professor Richet called ; I came, saw, and was\nconquered.\nNay, there is a previous incident which at this juncture is still\nmore exactly ad rem. The first accounts of Mrs. Piper's trances\nwhich Dr. Hodgson, with strongly expressed conviction of their\ngenuine character, sent over to England were evidentially, in my\njudgment, weak in the extreme. Especially they contained statements\nas to a departed friend of my own, correct so far as printed sources\n\u2022could have furnished them, but beyond that point vague or false\naltogether. Here I was on my own chosen ground. I had made a\nspecial study of such messages; I was accustomed to analyse their\npossible sources ; and I was especially sensitive to the cruel possibility\nof accepting a lying message as though it came from some well-loved\nsoul. Dr. Hodgson's tone of conviction jarred me to the depths. I\nrefused to give the messages to the persons concerned. I wrote again\nand again insisting on the suspicious\u2014as I held them the damning\npoints ; in a tone from which only my respect for my correspondent\naverted a touch of scorn. The sequel I need hardly tell. Further\nevidence from Dr. Hodgson himself and from others, and, more than\nall, personal sittings with Mrs. Piper, convinced me that the objections\nwhich I thought unanswerable were groundless, and that Dr.\nHodgson's conviction, which I had wondered that I failed to shake,\nwas based on far more of intimate evidence than his letters could carry,\nand was, as to my mind his ultimate convictions have always been,\n-the reasonable outcome of conscientious care.\nLong may we thus differ, and thus become agreed ! Long may all\nwe fellow-workers bestow on each other's work a more jealous scrutiny\nthan we can hope for from the indifferent world outside ! For many a\nyear yet it will be our duty to receive each new increment of knowledge\n\f64 Professor Lodge.

But it should be observed\nthat Dr. Hodgson does not attack the phenomena themselves\u2014he cannot\ndo that, since he has never observed them,\u2014nor has he anything much to\nsay against the report itself, i.e., the only portion of the complete report\nwhich as yet has been published by us, but (1) he attacks our detailed notes,\nsaying that they are meagre and inadequate as descriptions of what occurred,\nand (2) he considers that we should have not only made them much fuller\noriginally but also published every portion of them with amplification rather\nthan abridgment. \u2022\nNow as regards the second point the entire Eusapia report will probably\nbe rather bulky, and may very likely contain statements from other observers,\nanalogous to the statement already published of mine ; for fuller detail I\nmust refer Dr. Hodgson to these statements. He says that in not giving still\nmore elaborate details I am ' ' forsaking the scientific method \" ; but with\ndeference I submit that we have already given more details than is customary\nin a scientific paper. If indeed the event we were describing were an event\nnever to occur again in the lifetime of the present generation, like a transit\nof Venus, then it might be worth while to fill volumes with detailed\naccounts from every4observer (even though they might never get read) ; but\nwhen an experiment or observation is capable of repetition it is customary to\nstate it as carefully as possible, to give a few illustrative extracts from a note\nbook, and there to leave it. It would be most tedious, and is a justly\ncondemned process, to \" publish the laboratory note-book.\" I consider that\nwe have published sufficient to serve as a sample of the events at my first four\n(as far as I am concerned by far the most important) sittings ; and so I do\nnot agree with Dr. Hodgson's contention about publishing. But I am by no-\nmeans disposed to disagree altogether with his first contention, that the notes\nare a meagre and brief record of what occurred. Their brevity renders it the\nmore necessary to remember that each note is an accurate and carefully\nweighed statement, erring always on the side of defect rather than on the\nside of excess. So far as they go they are precise, and if a critic of the\nevidence chooses to disbelieve them in any particular he \"may safely\nassume \" that he is making a mistake.\nI may point out that an observer in a laboratory is accustomed to con\ncentrate his attention on what is occurring, and does not allow either the\nwriting or the dictation of notes to interfere with his careful observation at\nthe time. He repeats the experiment till he is satisfied, and then publishes\nhis facts, but he never expects to produce so full and complete a record\nas to dispense with the need for repetition and verification by others.\nFaraday knew something about physical experiments, but when given &\n\fMAB.-APR., 1895.] Additional Remarks. 65\ndescription of a new experiment\u2014even in ordinary physics\u2014he is reported\nto have said \" let me see it : without seeing it I cannot properly realise it\nin all its conditions,\" or words to that effect. So I say now. The notes are\nmemoranda of the facts as they occurred ; they are not exhaustive descrip\ntions ; I never thought of trying to make them so. What I did try to do was\nto attend to and emphasise strongly in my report every doubtful and suspicious\npoint. Accordingly, instead of assuming that whenever a fact in favour of a\nphenomenon is not mentioned therefore it did not occur, it would on the whole\nbe truer, though also more rash and not at all to be recommended, to assume\nthat whenever there is no record of a possible flaw in the evidence or loop\nhole for a trick then there was no such flaw in the facts.\nThe notes are as good as were feasible under the circumstances. It is not\noften, I believe, that such good notes have been taken at seances\u2014it is one of\nthe features of our series, \u2014but I myself did not go to the Mediterranean to\ntake or to dictate notes : I went to see the occurrences and satisfy myself on\nthe spot of their authenticity or otherwise. I did so satisfy myself, and I am\nabsolutely convinced, but far be it from me to say that that fact is important.\nIt will be a more important day in the history of the S.P.R.. when Dr.\nHodgson, with his admittedly wider experience of frauds and his long\nattention to conjuring and other devices, himself succeeds in witnessing\nreal psycho-physical phenomena, and at last convinces himself of their\ngenuineness. 1 venture to say that he will never do this by reading\nreports.\nI do not however expect even him to produce detailed notes such as will\nsatisfy outsiders and persons who have not themselves experienced the things.\nFor by the process of sometimes disbelieving the record, sometimes assuming\nan inverted order for the occurrences, and sometimes postulating very gross\nmal-observation and carelessness, a critic of the future may I fear hereafter be\nable to maul Dr. Hodgson's hypothetical notes almost as gratuitously as he has\nnow done ours.\nBefore concluding I will reply briefly to such of his criticisms as strike\nme as most plausible. I refer to marginal numbers in his text.\n(1) I still agree that \"continuous close observation \" is very difficult, and\nmy conviction in respect of some of the occurrences now under discussion is\npartly due to the fact that close observation during the actual occurrence of an\nevent was often sufficient.\n(2) In my last series of sittings with Professor Sidgwick I was able to\nrealise what is here spoken of concerning the elusiveness of a hand ; but on\nthe island this difficulty for some reason was much less marked, and for long\nperiods together the left hand and whole fore-arm would lie in my hand and\nfore-arm, completely grasped and almost passive except for muscular contrac\ntions during the exertion of distant force. I believe that the right hand was\nusually the more active of the two.\n(3) The statement in italics, that, in the past experience of someone, \"no\ncontact as of a hand was ever felt while both hands were being held by a\njingle person,\" can hardly be held to negative and outweigh my definite\nstatement and repeated experience of a contrary kind. I quote from the\nNovember Journal, pp. 348 et seq.\nSitting I., 10.51. \" While L. held head and both hands, and M. held both\nfeet, M. was touched as with a hand on his arm and body.\"\nSitting I. 11.34. \" L. holding both hands oj E., was distinctly touched\nas by a hand on the shoulder and back of head.\"\nSitting II., page 352. \" L. was then permitted to hold both hands and\nboth feet (the foot apparatus being removed) and he was then touched twice\n\f66 Professor Lodge. [MAR.-APR.,\non the back and grasped distinctly on the left arm. [Incidentally I may add\nthat Eusapia's mode of giving her feet to be held by another person's legs is;\na very thorough one. There is no question possible about deception.]\nSitting III., page 354. During this sitting the experience was a frequent\none : I continue to quote from the printed record. \" Several times during the\nnext hour Lodge was touched, grasped, and pinched while he distinctly held'\nboth Eusapia's hands and feet.\" '' While Lodge held both hands and feet the\nlarge table was several times violently moved.\"\n\" E. now held both her hands on Lodge's head [it should be understood\nthat I still had hold of them with my hands too : if I had let go with my\nhands the fact would assuredly have been noted] and Myers held both her\nknees. . . . tlie square table made a vigorous scraping movement along the-\nfloor towards us.\"\n'* While Lodge held both the medium's h ands on the table, and also her head\nleaning over on to him away from the chalet, and while Richet held both her\nfeet, the suspended chalet was heard to be wound partially up three times,\"\nand to do many other specified things.\nL. \" had also several distinct hand-grasps as frim a bare hand coming'\nfrom E.'s shoulder, both her real hands being at the time completely in his\ncontrol.\"\nI really do not see how Dr. Hodgson can get over these state\nments on any of his hypotheses without attributing to us definite and\ndeliberate falsehood. I can understand a sceptic's taking refuge in the\nsupposition that (say) Richet was playing tricks, or that there was some other\nconfederate in the room, but Dr. Hodgson declines these hypotheses and\nsupposes that Eusapia herself was doing the things in a normal way !\n(4) I say distinctly that I held, i.e., grasped, both hands of Eusapia while-\nphenomena requiring a hand were occurring. It appears to be not always\npossible to do this, but Eusapia (or John), knowing of my frequent request\nfor this test, afforded it to me whenever it was possible, and often in a\nmanner as satisfactory as I could wish.\n(5) \" Are we to accept the statement that Ochorowicz saw the table rise\nin the air ? \" By no means unless we choose ; but that is what Ochorowicz:\nstated, and that is what is down in the notes.\n(6) The long explanation of how scrawls on the table might have been\ndone by conjuring are rendered somewhat unnecessary by our remark in the\nprinted notes that \"this has too much the superficial aspect of a conjuring\ntrick to be altogether satisfactory ; \" shewing that we had fully recognised'\nthese possibilities, though we did not consider them very probable under the\ncircumstances.\n(7) This is the one useful critical contribution which I am able to feel that\nDr. Hodgson has made to the evidence. When the table was raised by the-\nstanding Eusapia the hypothesis of a hook and a strap round her neck did not\noccur to me, as it ought to have done . I do not imagine that the lifting\nwas done that way, but I am not quite sure that it might not be thus feasible;\nconsequently on this point not only the record but the observation itself at the\ntime was incomplete and inadequate.\n(8) I do not find that Dr. Hodgson is able to pick any hole in the record\nof the chalet experiment, on which I lay some stress ; nor indeed in a previous:\nexperiment, I., 12 '4, where Richet was grasped while each of Eusapia's hands\nwere being \"firmly held in the air \" by Myers and myself; his criticism in such\ncases resolves itself into an impeachment of the accuracy rather than the;\n\fMAE.\u2014APR., las5.] Experiences avec Eusapia Paladino. 67\nadequacy of the report : and this of course opens up a separate series of\nquestions.\n(9) The swelling of the curtain on this occasion was as if some large body\nwere in it, or as if it were swollen with wind. The drag of a hand or rod or\nstring could hardly be spoken of as producing a \"swollen \" appearance.\nFinally, on the subject of \"holding \" in general, I may say that in the\nsecond series of sittings under the control of Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick the\nfeet were hold almost all the time by a person who got under the table and\nused his hands for the purpose, and extremely elaborate attention was paid to\nthe manner of holding of the hands. This procedure was evidently wise,\nin order to impress S.P.R. critics, but it is not equally calculated to impress\neverybody. It is singular how intensely and narrowly Dr. Hodgson concen\ntrates his attention on methods of holding ; but I find that my scientific\nfriends, with a few of whom I have privately discussed the matter, are much\nmore liable to consider the elaborate attention given to the holding as a\nblind adopted to conceal the real modus operandi, which they are disposed to\nimagine must have more probably taken the shape of an unseen confederate\nor a collusive sitter. Eusapia herself they regard as a lay figure. If then in\nour notes we had over-emphasised to the minutest details the attitude of her\nhands and the location of her feet, we should have been only strengthening\nthis view in their minds. There are many adverse critics, and some fix\ntheir attention on one point, and some on another. It is almost proverbially\nimpossible to conciliate everybody by any adopted mode of procedure, and\nfor my part I do not propose to try. I would rather say to any present or\nfuture critic, Go to Naples and examine the matter for yourself, or else wait\nand find some similarly endowed person nearer home, and do not finally\nmake up your mind on the subject without personal experience.\nOLIVEE J.

IM*R. \u2014APR., isa5\nqui est la plus simple. Tout le problems se ramfene done a cette unique\nquestion. Est-ce que nous tenions bien les mains d'Eusapia 1\nM. Hodgson ne le croit pas. M. O. Lodge, M. Fred. Myers, M.\nOchorowicz et moi nous le croyons. II s'agit done d'examiner ce point.\nTout d'abord il semble que M. Hodgson a tort de reprocher a M. O.\nLodge de ne pas donner plus de details. II est clair que lorsque on dit,\nla main est bien tenue, des details plus circonstancies deviennent\npresque inutiles. Comme cela se repete pres de cent fois au moins\ndans une seance, il suffit de s'entendre, ce que nous avons fait constam-\nment, sur le sens de ce mot : la main est bien tenue. Cela signifie\nd'abord qu'on n'a aucun doute sur le c-3t4 de la main qu'on tient. Si,\nen tenant la main pendant qu'un phenomene se produisait, je n'e'tais\npas absolument sur que c'etait la main droite (au cas oii j'avais pour\nmission de tenir la main droite) aussitot j'arretais tout, en disant,\n\" j'ai lachtS la main \" ; et tous les expeVimentateurs faisaient de meme.\nDe plus nous avions pris le parti de tenir la main fortement, tous les\ndoigts dans notre paume, ou le poignet et une partie des doigts dans\nnotre main ; le plus souvent les deux avant-bras, celui d'Eusapia et le\nmien, e'taient cdte a c6te, et les deux mains, celle d'Eusapia et la\nmienne, etroitement unies. Enfin nous avions soin, a chaque phenomene,\nde nous rappeler,les uns et les autres, a 1'observation exacte, et peut-\n4tre cent fois dans le cours d'une seance, de maniere a en etre ennuyeux\net meme insupportables, ad nauseam, nous repetions\u2014\u2022\" je tiens bien la\nmain droite,\" \" je tiens bien la main gauche.\"\nS'il s'agissait d'experimentateurs novices, peut-etre eblouis, ou\neffraye's par la nouveaute des phe'nomenes, je comprendrais les doutes\nde M. Hodgson, et je les partagerais assurement. Mais il s'agit\nd'experimentateurs qui avaient conserve tout leur sang-froid, et qui\ncertes ne songeaient qu'a faire une experience dans de bonnes\nconditions. S'il m'est permis de parler de moi, je dirai que j'ai\nexperimente avec Eusapia 5 fois a Milan, 10 fois a Rome ; 40 fois a\nCarqueiranne, et a 1'ile Roubaud, ou elle est rested trois inois. Pendant\nces trois mois, deja prepare par les experiences faites a Rome et a Milan,\nje n'ai pas songe a autre chose qu'a ce point tres special, et cependant\ntres important, de bien tenir la main, de maniere a ne pas laisser cette\nmain se liberer, prendre des objets, et me toucher au dos, au nez, au\nfront. Avec Ochorowicz qui est reste' presque tout le temps a Pile\nRoubaud, et qui avait eu a Varsovie et a Rome une trentaine de seances\ndeja, nous n'avons pas songe' a autre chose. Nous n'avions done pas\nd'autre preoccupation que celle d'empecher une des mains d'Eusapia de\nnous echapper.\nEh bien ! sans me croire plus perspicace et plus habile qu'il ne\nconvient, il me semble que cette constante preoccupation, cette idee\nfixe doit un peu me garantir du reproche d'avoir conclu a la legere.\nII me semble qu'apres trois mois d'exercice et de meditations on peut\narriver a la certitude qu'on tient bien une main humaine.\nDans une experience (la derniere, je crois) qui a etc' tres brillante,\nMadame Sidgwick tenait la main gauche d'Eusapia, et mon savant ami\nle Dr. Ch. Segard, medecin en chef de la marine, tenait la main droite.\n\fMAE.\u2014APR , 1895.] Experiences avec Eusapia Paladino. 69\nII avait d'ailleurs deja assiste a plusieurs experiences. Quinze ou vingt\nfois dans le cours de la seance, je lui ai demande, ainsi qu'a Madame\nSidgwick, \" Etes-vous bien, bien sur de tenir la main 1 et la meme\nmain ? \" Et, sur son affirmation, j'ajoutais, \" Prenez garde, si vous\nvous trompez, c'est presque de la complicite ! \"\nII est certain en effet qu'affirmer solennellement, resolument, sans\naucune hesitation, qu'on tient la main droite d'Eusapia, cela veut dire\nqu'on en est vraiment sur, et cette affirmation, portant sur un fait facile\net simple, ne comporte probablement pas d'erreur.\nCela est si vrai qu'avec Ochorowicz nous avions imaging divers\nappareila electriques pour remplacer ce procede elementaire de la main\ntenue dans notre main. Je fais grace au lecteur de la description de\nces divers instruments : ils e'taient tres ingenieux, mais ils ne\nm'inspiraient aucune confiance. Je crois beaucoup aux instruments\nprecis en physique et en physiologic ; mais, quand il faut les laisser\ndans 1'obscurite, livres a la fantaisie d'un medium, je n'y attache plus\naucun prix. A toute 1'instrumentation je prefere, et de beaucoup,\nsimplement ma main. Car, lorsque je tiens bien solidement la main\ndroite d'Eusapia dans ma main ou mes deux mains, je suis sur, autant\nqu' humainement on peut etre sur de quelque chose, qu'elle ne peut pas\npromener cette mdme main droite sur mes cheveux.\nNous avions aussi essaye de tenir les pieds (de'chausses) avec nos\npieds (de'chausses). Mais cela est loin de donner une securite absolue ;\ncar la sensibilite' tactile des pieds est assez grossiere. De meme les\nappareils electriques pour les pieds ont <5t6 finalement tout a fait\nabandonnes, comme n'inspirant pas une confiance suffisante ; et, pour\nles pieds comme pour les mains, le meilleur proce'de' nous a paru etre de\nles tenir avec nos mains. Aussi, au moins dans la derniere serie des\nexperiences, 1'un de nous se mettait-il par terre, ayant pour unique\nfonction de tenir avec ses deux mains les deux pieds d'Eusapia.\nII me semble que cette methode est encore la meilleure. Cela vaut\ntous les appareils, et toutes les ligatures : car les appareils se detraquent\nou se faussent : les nceuds se defont, et peuvent etre refaits, si bien que\nla conviction n'est jamais complete. Au contraire, avec la main, on\nobtient la certitude, et je suis convaincu que ce procede', que M.\nHodgson trouve defectueux, est celui auquel il aurait recours apres\navoir tente d'autres me'thodes.\nCela bien pose, il est une experience qui me parait fondamentale.\nElle ne reussit malheureusement pas toujours, et il faut parfois\nbeaucoup de patience pour obtenir le phenomene.\nII s'agit de tenir les deux mains du medium ; et d'etre soi-memo\ntouche par une main bien distincte.\nII est clair que, lorsque je dis une main bien distincte, je suppose\nqu'on a songe a toutes les supercheries possibles. Un contact vague, ce\nn'est pas une main ; la sensation d'un moignon, ou d'une paume ne\nsiitlit pas. Une main bien distincte, c'est une main nettement formed,\ndont on sent les doigts, qui est capable de pincer le bras, de tirer les\ncheveux ou la barbe, de faire sentir ses doigts, de donner en un ruot\n\f70 Professeur Richet. [MAR.\u2014APR., iss5.\nune sensation telle qu'une main seule peut la donner ; main vivante,\nanimee, tout a fait identique a une main humaine.\nEh bien ! cette experience, je 1'ai faite ; et, pour ne pas parler des\nexperiences de Rome ou elle avait reussi aussi, a 1'ile Roubaud 4 fois\nelle a reussi avec moi. Une fois entre autres, je tenais d'une main les\ndeux mains d'Eusapia ; je leve mon autre main en 1'air, tres haut ; alors\ncette main qui est en Fair est saisie vigoureusement par une main qui\nme prend deux doigts, les tire avec force, et, apres les avoir tires, me\ndonne, sur le dos de cette meme main, une tape assez forte que tout le\nmonde entend.\nCe n'est pas moi seulement qui ai ete ainsi touche par une main\ndistincte, alors que je tenais les deux mains.\nLe 9 juillet Ochorowicz est touche dans le dos par une main bien\ndistincte, alors qu'il tenait les deux mains d'Eusapia.\nLe 21 juillet Lodge, tenant les deux mains d'Eusapia est touche'\ndistinctement par une main a 1'epaule.\nLe 26 juillet, pendant que je tenais les deux mains d'Eusapia, je\nsuis touche par une grande main qui se proniene sur ma tete.\nCe qui rend cette sorte d'experience tres instructive, et a mon sens\nabsolument decisive, c'est qu'il faut admettre ou une hallucination\ntactile, ce qui me parait absurde ; ou une mauvaise plaisanterie de la\npart d'un des assistants, ce qui est impossible a admettre ; ou enfin, et\nc'est la conclusion a laquelle j'arrive, quelque chose comme la materiali\nsation d'une main vivante ; conclusion que j'admets en desespoir de\ncause ; et a laquelle je ne me resigne pas sans douleur. Les cas dans\nlesquels un experimentateur A. tient les deux mains, et un autre\nexperimentateur B. est touche par une main sont tres nombreux, et\npresque aussi probants.\nLe ler juillet, Ochorowicz tient les deux mains : je suis touche par\nune main. Le meme jour je tiens les deux mains ; Ochorowicz, a\ngenoux, tient les deux pieds, et il est touche a la tete par cinq doigts\ndistincts.\nLe 9 juillet, je tiens les deux mains ; Ochorowicz est touche\ndistinctement par une main ( a deux reprises).\nLe 25 juillet, Lodge tient les deux mains ; Myers est touche par\nune main.\nLe 21 juillet, Lodge tient les deux mains. Myers est touche par\nune main qui lui presse le bras ; puis, quelque temps apres, Lodge\ntenant toujours les deux mains, Myers sent une grosse main qui le\nfrappe dans le dos.\nQuant aux cas dans lesquels un experimentateur A. tient une main\nd'Eusapia ; un autre B. tient 1'autre main ; et ou cependant des objets\nvolumineux se meuvent dans la piece, en meme temps qu'une main est\nnettement vue ou sentie, nous en avons des exemples si nombreux qu'il\nme parait, dans cette note de critique, inutile de les rapporter.\nSi encore il suffisait d'un moment d'inadvertance pour expliquer le\nphenomene, j'admettrais bien que pendant une longue periode de une\n\fMAR.\u2014APK., 1895.] Experiences avec Eusapia Paladino. 71\n\u2022ou deux heures d'expeYience, il s'est produit une negligence d'un\ninstant, que la main d' Eusapia alors a etc' abandonnee, et, devenant\nlibre, a pu prendre un des objets voisins. Je sais parfaitement que\n1'attention ne peut se prolonger pendant une heure, avec toute certitude\n\u00abt toute efficacite ; mais les choses ne se passent pas ainsi. Comme 1'ont\nfait remarquer avec raison Lodge et Myers, comme cela est Evident pour\ntoutes les personnes qui ont assiste' aux experiences d'Eusapia ; les\nphenomenes n'ont pas lieu par surprise ; on est preVenu que quelque\nchose va se produire par le fre'missement, 1'agitation et, si je puis dire,\nla tension vibratoire de tout le corps du me'dium. C'est done k ce\nmoment que tout naturellement on redouble d'attention ; et qu'on tient\nle mieux les mains du medium. A moins d'etre bien detestable expe'ri-\nmentateur, on ne va pas choisir le moment decisif, le moment de\nI'expe'rience, pour laisser la main libre.\nCe n'est pas tout. Meme si la main\u2014ce que je ne crois nullement\u2014\n\u2022& pu se libe'rer, il faut encore qu' elle revienne en place : or le phenomene\nvient de se produire : on en a e'te' formellement averti. Pour que, a ce\nmoment me'me, on soit repris par une main qu'on a quittee un instant,\n\u2022et qu'on ne s'apergoive pas de cette substitution, il faut vraiment une\n\u2022dose de trouble ou de negligence qui me parait un peu forte.\nMeme j'admettrais que j'ai commis une fois, deux fois, dix fois,\nvingt fois, cette negligence difficile a comprendre ; ce que je n'admets\npas, c'est que, ne songeant pas autre chose, poursuivi, hanie', par cette\npreoccupation unique de ne pas abandonner la main que je tiens, j'ai\n4te deux cents ou trois cents fois assez leger (pour ne pas dire plus) pour\nne m'etre pas apergu que j'avais lache la main, et qu' apres la production\ndu phe'nomene, Eusapia avait habilement replace sa main dans la mienne.\nEt cette legerete impardonnable, je ne serais par seul 4 1'avoir commise.\nM. Aksakoff, M. Schiaparelli, M. J. Finzi, M. Siemiradsky, M. de\nSchrenck-Notzing, M. Ochorowicz, M. Se'gard, M. O. Lodge, M.

Ici c'est tout autre chose. Devant le meme public,\nattentif, qui cherche constamment & la prendre en faute, e'tudie minu-\ntieusement toutes les conditions de 1'experience,Eusapia consent a recom\nmencer presque inde'finiment les memes phenomenes, de maniere meme\na lasser notre patience ; tant toutes les seances se ressemblent. Qui en\n& vu une en a vu cent ; et il n'y a d'autre profit a assister a beaucoup\nd'experiences, que de devenir de plus en plus experimente et capable de\nles juger.\nII me parait done impossible de se refuser a admettre la proposition\nsuivante.\n\f72 Professeur RicheL [MAR.\u2014APR., I89S,\nAlors qu'on tient solidement, ou qu'on croit tenir, lea deux mains,\nd' Eusapia, une main vivante esl perfue, tantot par celui qui tient les\nniains d'Eusapia, tantot par un autre des assistants.\nMais, je 1'avouerai, toute cette discussion repose sur un fait de\nsensibilite tactile : la notion qu'on a, ou qu'on croit avoir, les deux\nmains du medium bien tenues. II est possible qu'il y ait la place d\nquelque illusion. A vrai dire, la sensation est tellement nette (aussi\nbien celle des deux mains tenues, que celle de la main etrangere\nperdue) que je me refuse provisoirement a croire que c'est une illusion,\net je m'y refuserai jusque a ce qu'un prestidigitateur quelconque puisse\nme faire croire que je tiens ses deux mains bien solidement fixees dan&\nles miennes, alors qu;il a en realite' pu liberer une de ses deux mains,\ntout en me faisant croire que je les tiens toutes les deux.\nC'est la a mon sens I'expe'rience fondamentale ; mais la critique de\nM. Hodgson porte aussi sur d'autres points.\nJe prendrai d'abord les experiences de soulevement de la table, et\nspecialement de la grosse table de 1m.2 de surface et de 1m. de cdte',\npesant 22 kilogrammes. Cette table est sans rebord. La hauteur des\npieds est de Om. 75c. Les pieds sont termines en pointe, de maniere a\nrendre presque impossible le soulevement par une pression exercee au-\ndessous de ces pieds pointus. Je 1'avais fait construire a Hyeres, et,\nquand elle nous fut apport^e dans Pile Roubaud, Ochorowicz et moi\nnous pensames qu'Eusapia, meme avec le secours de la force dite\npsychique, ne pourrait la soulever. Mais, a notre extreme surprise,\nnos craintes furent de^ouees. Le soir m\u00a3me, dans les conditions\nordinaires, il y eut trois soulevements complets de la table, qui pendant\nune ou deux secondes quitta completement le sol.\nL'expe'rience me parait tout a fait decisive ; car, en maniant nous-\nmeme cette table, et en faisant durant plusieurs jours une serie d'essais,\nnous avons pu constater qu'il n'y a que trois manieres de soulever la\ntable\u2014(et, par parenthese, je serais fort heureux que M. Hodgson prit\nla peine, pour une guinee, tout au plus, de faire construire en bois de\nsapin une table semblable, de maniere a pouvoir controler nos affir\nmations).\nOn peut soulever cette table de 22 kil. :\u2014\nA. En se penchant sur la table et en la prenant avec les deux mains\nporte'es en avant, a environ Om. 50c. du cote' ou on est debout. Mais il\nfaut deployer toute sa force. Malgre' ma grande taille (1m. 85c.) c'est\na peine si j'y arrive.\nB. En se pla\u00a7ant sous la table et en la soulevant avec le dos.\nC. En etant assis, en faisant une contrepression avec les mains, et\nen allongeant une jambe, de maniere a soulever la table avec une jambe\nallongee, le creux du jarret de cette jambe prenant son point d'appui\nsur le genou du cote oppose. C'est la methode qui me semblerait la\nplus commode, mais elle n'est possible que si 1'on a de tres grandes\njambes et si 1'on deploie beaucoup de force.\nEusapia a-t-elle pu, dans les conditions ou la levitation de cette table\na 4te obtenue, operer par 1'un ou 1'autre de ces procedes ?\n\fMAH.-APR., lag5.] Experiences avec Eusapia Paladino. 73\nJe rappelerai qu'elle e^ait debout, e'troitement serree entre les deux\nexperimentateurs (Ochorowicz et moi dans trois levitations\u2014Myers et\nLodge dans deux autres) ; que 1'un de ses voisins lui tenait une main\nappliquee a plat sur la table, et que 1'autre voisin lui tenait 1'autre\nmain levee en I'air, ou reposant sur la sienne.\nLe fait d'etre debout elimine completement 1'hypothese C. : puisque\nil faut, pour soulever ainsi la table, etre assis. De 1'hypothese B., il ne\npeut etre question. Quant a 1'hypothese A., elle n'est pas dependable ;\npar cette raison qu'Eusapia lie touchait la table que d'une main, et\nencore a plat sur la table, 1'autre main etant entierement tenue par\nnous.\nJe le re'pe'te ; 1'expe'rience peut etre refaite par M. Hodgson. II est\nimpossible avec une seule main de soulever une pareitte table.\nReste la supposition des crochets, des cordes, des appareils ; eh\nbien ! il n'y a pas moyen d'admettre cette supercherie. Nulle trace\nd'erosion sur cette table, en bois mou, toute neuve. Meme en supposant\nque nous ayions laisse Eusapia, serree de pres par nous, et dont nous\nne lachions pas, semble-t-il, les mains, se munir d'une corde et de la\npasser sous la table, je ne vois pas comment avec cette corde elle aurait\npu soulever par le cou ou les epaules cette lourde table. D'ailleurs,\npour quiconque a assiste a cette experience, 1'idee d'une corde est tout\na fait invraisemblable. Mais il y a mieux ; a moins de supposer a\nEusapia la force de deux hommes tres vigoureux, il y a une impossibilite'\nmateVielle a soulever par une corde une pareille table des quatre pieds,.\nlorsque une seule main est le'gerement appuyee sur la table.\nDes photographies nombreuses (au magnesium) ont ete prises, qui\nmontrent la maniere dont la table (il ne s'agit plus de la grosse table,\nmais d'une table plus legere, de 7 kil.) est soulevee. II n'y a evidem-\nment ni crochet, ni corde, ni appareil. La seule hypothese, je ne dis pas\nvraisemblable, mais discutable, c'est qu' Eusapia met un de ses pieds\n(le pied droit) sous le pied gauche de la table, et, faisant contrepression\navec la main, obtient ainsi un soulevement. Mais, dans nombre de\nphotographies, cette hypothese ne peut etre admise ; par exemple\nlorsque la table est souleve'e quand Eusapia se tient par le cote large,\nou encore lorsque on applique la main sur les deux genoux qu'on\nmaintient immobiles, ou encore lorsque Eusapia est debout. En tout\ncas avec la grande table de 22 kil. cela est impossible, et c'est ce qui me\nfait considerer comme ayant une valeur pre'ponderante 1'experience\nfaite avec cette lourde table.\nCe ne sont la que les principales experiences ; celles qui sont le plus-\ncommunes ; il en est quantite d'autres, presque absolument inexplic-\nables par 1'hypothese de la prestidigitation. Par exemple, en presence\nde M. et de Madame Sidgwick, en demi-lumiere, les deux mains\nd'Eusapia etant bien tenues et vues sur la table ; la tete et la bouche\ne'tant tenues par un des assistants ; les deux pieds tenus par un autre\nassistant qui etait par terre ; a diverses reprises, nous avons entendu,\nfrapper des notes sur un piano voisin. Ou bien encore un objet\nvolumineux (un melon) pesant 7 '200 kil., place sur une chaise derriere\nEusapia, se trouve doucement apporte sur la table, et sur cette meme\n\f74 Professeur Richet. [MAR \u2014APR., ISQS.\ntable souleve' a diverses reprises, pendant que les deux mains sont tenues\npar la meme personne ;\u2014ou encore, en demi-lumiere, alors que les pieds\nsont dans 1'appareil electrique qui fonctionne tres regulierement, les\ndeux mains e'tant vues de tout le monde et leve'es en 1'air, en meme\ntemps qu'elles sont tenues, un harmonium place' a terre joue non pas des\n.airs, mais des notes se'parees, et nous entendons comme la pression des\ndoigts sur les touches. Ou encore, un appareil electrique etant adapte\na une balance romaine, de maniere a donner une assez vive lumiere des\nque la balance est remue'e (poids de plus de 8 kil. ne'cessaire pour faire\nmouvoir la balance) ; nous obtenons le mouvement de la bascule\nsans rien voir d'anormal ; les pieds et les mains e'tant d'ailleurs tenus\ncomme d'habitude. Ou encore\u2014et c'est peut-etre le phenomene le plus\nsurprenant, au milieu de toutes ces choses etranges\u2014a travers les vete-\nments une marque de crayon est faite sur la chemise de 1'un de nous, et,\nce qui est plus surprenant encore, sur une page blanche, notre doigt,\nparfaitement propre, tra\u00a7ant cinq fois de suite, en pleine lumiere, des\nmarques de crayon.\nMais je n'insiste pas sur cette nombreuse seYie de phe'nomenes.\nNous les reprendrons, et nous les exposerons sans doute, bient6t, en\nindiquant quels sont les points essentiels. Ici nous avons voulu seule-\nment re'pondre a cette objection de M. Hodgson que nous avions\nprocede' a la le'gere. Je ne crois pas que ce reproche soit tout a fait\nme'rite'. De tous les contrfiles possibles, le contrdle de notre sens tactile\n\u2022est le plus precis, et c'est & celui-la que nous nous en sommes rapporte's.\nDans toutes les sciences, il s'agit toujours d'un phe'nomene accessible &\nun sens, et le sens du toucher, quand malheureusement il n'y a pas\nmoyen de se servir du sens de la vue, est un des plus exacts.\nComme le disait tres bien O. Lodge, c'est sans le moindre\nenthousiasme que nous arrivons a la conclusion que ces faits sont vrais.\nII est meme vraiment pe'nible de constater la ve'rite' de ces phe'nomenes\ndeux fois absurdes, absurdes par la grossierete' et 1'insigninance de ces\nmanifestations ridicules, absurdes, parce qu'ils sont en contradiction\navec tous les faits connus.\nUn autre sentiment bien penible, c'est de constater qu'il n'y a\naucun progres dans les manifestations medianimiques obtenues. C'est\ntoujours la meme chose ; et nulle education ne parait possible. Quelle\ndifference entre cette methode empirique d'experimentation, et la\nme'thode scientifique, qui, apres chaque experience, aboutit a un\nnouveau progres ! ce progres, si petit qu'il soit, reste acquis, et acquis\npour toujours. Ici, au contraire, il semble que tout soit toujours a\nrecommencer. Je me souviens, pour prendre un exemple qui m'est\npersonnel, qu'en e'tudiant il y a quelques anne'es la regulation thermique\ndes animaux par la polypnee, pendant pres de deux ans, par de\nlaborieuses experiences, j'arrivais a en donner la the'orie, et a indiquer\nles experiences necessaires. Mais chaque pas que je faisais restait\nacquis, et, au fur et a mesure que j'avan\u00a7ais, je voyais se clevelopper\nla the'orie qui marchait avec le progres des experiences ; et c'e'tait une\nvraie joie scientifique ; car, s'il n'y a pas quelque the'orie rationnelle\nderriere les faits, nulle satisfaction pour le savant. Mais, dans les\n\fsun.\u2014APR., 1895.] Reponse a M. Hodgson. 75\nexperiences de Milan, de Rome et de 1'ile Roubaud, nous n'avons eu\nque la douleur scientifique d'assister a des faits qui confondent 1'intelli-\ngence, qui sont absurdes, et que nulle theorie, si audacieuse qu'elle soit,\nne peut avoir la prevention d'expliquer, meme pour la plus minime part.\nQuoi qu'il en soit, ce sont des faits. Nous avons tache de les bien\nobserver \u2022 et notre devoir etait de le dire.\nY a-t-il eu une cause ou des causes graves d'erreur 1 C'est possible,\net il faudrait etre bien teme'raire pour oser dire, \"Jeneme suis pas\ntrompe'.\" Encore faudra-t-il nous montrer ou est la cause de notre\nerreur.\nREPONSE A M. HODGSON.\nPAR LE DR. J. OCHOROWICZ.\nCHER MONSIEUR MYERS,\u2014J'ai lu avec plaisir les epreuves que vous\navez bien voulu m'envoyer : la philippique de M. le Dr. Hodgson et\nvotre re'ponse. Je les ai lues avec plaisir toutes les deux, car si,\ncomme vous le devinez, ma position est pres de vous, je considere\nne*anmoins 1'article de M. Hodgson comme tres remarquable et tres\nutile.\nII est remarquable, parce qu'il denote une connaissance approfondie\ndes trues medianimiques ; il est utile, parce que, au moment ou la science\nva s'occuper de ces choses, le plus severe examen des temoignages est a\nsa place. Nous n'avons pas deux opinions la-dessus.\nMais M. le Dr. Hodgson a un tort ; celui de ne pas avoir assiste\n.aux experiences.\nII en est requIte une se>ie d'objections, generalement tres justes,\nspirituelles mSme, inais tout dfait inapplicables dans le cas special.\nII est vrai qu' Eusapia aurait pu mettre un poids de quelques livres,\npour abaisser une pe'dale de notre appareil electrique. Seulement, pour\nmettre un poids, il faut 1'avoir, et elle ne 1'avait pas.\nII est vrai qu' a la place de son pied elle aurait pu mettre \" a dummy\nfoot \" dans 1'appareil en question. Mais nous, qui 1'avons examinee\ncontinuellement, nous savons que ce \"dummy foot\" n'existait pas.\nElle aurait pu appuyer les deux peclales avec le meme pied\u2014mais\npas dans notre appareil, qui avait une cloison longue et large, rendant\nimpossible la reunion des deux planches.\nElle aurait pu abaisser la pe^dale avec la pointe de son pied gauche,\ntandis que le talon du meme pied provoquait le \" gonflement \" de sa\nrobe\u2014mais, comme ses pieds etaient enfonces sous la table et que la robe\nse gonflait a cote de sa chaise, il aurait fallu admettre que lesdoigts de\nson pied gauche de'passent d'un demi-metre le talon, ce qui nous a paru\ndifficile.\nLe gonflement de la robe aurait pu etre provoque par un instrument\nspecial, plus ou moins ingenieux\u2014mais M. Lodge n'a pas cru devoir en\nparler, parce que, examinant immediatement la robe, nous n'y avons\nrien trouve'.\n\f76 Dr. Ochorowicz. [MAR\u2014APR., 1395.\nElle aurait pu fourrer une de ses bottines dans la fente entre la.\npedale et la boite, en de'chaussant clandestinement son pied\u2014mais\nd'abord la fente etait trop petite pour cela, et ensuite ses bottines onfe\ne'te retirees et placees a une distance convenable.\nElle aurait pu faire mieux que cela, en reunissant tout simplement\nles deux fils conducteurs pour arreter la sonnerie, sans mettre les pieds\ndans Tappareil\u2014mais elle ne 1'a pas fait, parce que, meme supposant des\nconnaissances necessaires pour le faire, les fils etaient soigneusement\nisoles et disposes, en prevision de cette manoeuvre ; et d'ailleurs,\n1'appareil a et^ examine' et essaye au moins une dizaine de fois au cours,\nd'une seance.\nPar consequent, tout en reconnaissant la perspicacite' theorique de\n1'auteur, M. Lodge ne peut pas s'avouer convaincu d'un manque de\nprudence, ayant prevu les objections qu'on lui fait, et peut-etre d'autres\nencore.\nII en est quelques-unes cependant. Par exemple : lorsque M. Lodge\naffirme \" there was light enough to see the position of everybody's,\nnormal hands,\" je ne comprends pas pour quelle raison M. le Dr. Hodg\nson suppose entre autres, que M. Lodge a pu confondre une main\nartificielle avec une main vivante, qu 'il voyait et qu 'il tenait dans la\nsienne ! Surtout si M. Lodge ajoute : \" It was a perfectly distinct\nphenomenon.\"\nNon ! n'exageYons pas !' II est bon d'etre mefiant, il est bon d'etre\nseVere, mais il faut aussi avoir un peu de foi dans 1'intelligence et la\nbonne volonte' des chercheurs qui ont fait leur preuves, et qui, en affir-\nmant des choses apparemment absurdes, risquent leur renomme'e\nscientifique. Dans les sciences acquises on leur accorde une confiance\ne'norme ; je comprends qu'on la diminue de beaucoup lorsqu'il s'agit\nd'une cate'gorie nouvelle de phe'nomenes, mais ce n'est pas encore une\nraison pour les traiter d'imbe'ciles.\nCertes, il y a dans le rapport de Imminent professeur de Liverpool\nde nombreuses omissions, et ce sont uniquement ces omissions qui\ndonnent a M. Hodgson 1'apparence d'une raison. Mais il y avait pour\ncela plusieurs causes :\n(1.) Vous vous rappelez, cher M. Myers, que les notes immediateset\nabregees d'une seule seance, ou je vous ai servi de secretaire (seance\nde'crite par M. Lodge en deux pages dans le Journal] contenaient 23\npages d'ecriture. Si on y mettait toutes vos paroles, concernant le\ncontrOle de toutes les minutes, cela occuperait peut-etre une centaine\nde pages, sans compter les descriptions detaillees, sans compter les\nreflexions individuelles qui n'ont pas ete prononcees a la seance, et les\ndiscussions, essais, verifications du lendemain qui ont dure souvent\nplusieurs heures. II aurait fallu mettre tout cela dans le rapport de\nM. Lodge pour convaincre M. le Dr. Hodgson. Et encore ! II\ntrouverait toujours moyen de lui reprocher romission d'un \" bouton\ndeboutonne' \" qui cachait peut-etre \" a light strong band \" servant a\nsoulever les tables. Ah, quel dommage que M. Hodgson n'ait pas ete\nla, pour voir que certaines photographies de la Invitation des tables ont\n\fMAR.\u2014APR., lags.] Rdponse a, M. Hodgson. 77\nle'te' faites en plein soleil du midi et que les robes blanches ou noires,\nboutons et rubans, n'y jouaient absolument aucun role !\n(2.) M. le Dr. Hodgson ne salt pas, ce quesavait M. Lodge, que les\n\u2022experiences de Varsovie (1893-4) ont mis hors de doute 1'absence de\n'toute sorte d'instruments speciaux dans les productions de la Paladino.\nEusapia a ete fouillee, de'shabillee, habillee, a plusieurs reprises, par\nune commission de medecins, avant, pendant, et apres les seances, et on\nn'a jamais trouve' rien de suspect. Pour ma part je 1'ai observed, en\nexaminant souvent ses poches, ses cheveux et ses vetements, pendant\ndeux mois dans ma maison a Varsovie, pendant deux mois chez M. le\nProf. Ch. Richet dans 1'ile Roubaud, et je puis affirmer qu'elle n'apporte\navec elle ni instruments speciaux, aussi minimes qu'ils soient, ni sub\nstances chimiques, pouvant servir a ses experiences. J'ajoute que\nje connais les trues des mystificateurs, dont parle M. Hodgson (sauf le\npetit appareil pour imiter les coups frapped, ce qui d'ailleurs peut etre\nfait d'une fa\u00a7on beaucoup plus simple) et quelques autres (comme par\nexemple les anneaux a pointes, dont se servait Mme Fay pour soulever les\npetites tables)\u2014et qu'un prestidigitateur de profession, M. Rybka, qui\nimite tres bien certains phenomenes me'dianimiques, invite par moi pour\n\u2022contr61er une seance d'Eusapia, avait declare' publiquement 1'absence\nde toute machination et I'impossibilite' de reproduire artificiellement les\nmemes phe'nomenes, dans les memes conditions.\n(3.) Dans les 74 seances d'Eusapia auxquelles j'ai assiste, j'ai eu\n1'occasion d'obserrer plusieurs particularites interessantes au point de\nvue physiologique, concernant la purete' des phenomenes. II est rare\nqu'une seance avec le me'dium napolitain ne donne absolument rien (ce\nqui arrive cependant lorsqu'elle est trop epuisee). Mais elles ont une\nvaleur bien differente : elles sont bonnes, mediocres, ou, bien rarement,\ntout a fait mauvaises. J'appelle une seance bonne ou mauvaise, non pas\nd'apres le nombre et 1'eclat des manifestations, mais d'apres leur pre'-\ncision et leur nettete, qui facilitent le contr61e. C'est dans les seances\nmauvaises qu'apparait la fraude inconsciente, d'ailleurs tout a fait\n\u2022inseparable de la mediumnite inferieure, et que je serais tente' d'appeler\nla fraude reflexe. Le controle devient alors difficile, mais avec de la\npatience on arrive a constater les tromperies, qui sont toutes d'un\ncaractere enfantin. Je ne parle pas de la tromperie consciente, car\nelle n'a jamais e'te prouvee chez Eusapia, et parait etre en contradiction\navec son caractere franc, loyal et desinteresse. M. Lodge et vous,\nvous avez eu la chance de tomber sur une serie de bonnes seances\u2014\nvoil& pourquoi les doutes ont ete vite dissipe's et le Rapport a pu etre\nallege d'une quantite de suppositions, developpees par M. Hodgson et\nneglige'es par M. Lodge.\nM. le Dr. Hodgson insiste avec raison sur le point principal du\ncontrole\u2014la bonne tenue des mains; mais il parait oublier, que, emIgre'\nles apparences, la valeur de cette constatation est toujours plutot sub\njective qu'objective et que ce n'est pas le nombre de centimetres\nCarre's de la surface converte par notre main, qui decide de la surete\ndu contr61e, mais une foule de petites circonstances, qui chaugent\n\f78 Dr. OchoTOwicZ.\na chaque moment, par consequent bien difficiles a decrire, et qui\ndeterminent dans 1'esprit du controleur ce sentiment subjectifde certi\ntude ou de doute dont il nous rend compte. Un seul doigt, tenu sans\ninterruption, a une distance convenable, peut quelquefois nous inspirer\nplus de certitude, qu'une main entierement serree, mais dont le bras\nplie conserve assez de liberte pour agir; par exemple, avec le coude. De\nsorte que, pourvu que le controleur connaisse pratiquement le true de\nla substitution, dans toutesses nuances, il trouvera facilement\/>\/Msiewrs\nmoyens de bien tenir une main, et nous autres, ne pouvant pas etre\njuges de toutes les particularites du moment, nous serons toujours\nobliges de lui accorder une oertaine dose de confiance\u2014si nous voulons,\nen ge'ntSral nous baser sur le te'moignage d'autrui. Quelquefois,\nEusapia nous aidait elle-meme ; elle serrait, par exemple, avec force\nla main du controleur A. tandis qu'elle tenait tranquillement celle du\ncontroleur B. pour bien montrer que ce n'est pas la meme main, qu'elle\ndonnait a eux deux.* De 1'autre cottS nous avons essaye, surtout a\nVarsovie, a peu pres tous les moyens de controle possibles\u2014cordons,\nligatures elastiques, fils de cuivre, contacts electriques sur la table ou\navec les controleurs, etc , et nous sommes arrives tous (c'est a dire tous\nceux qui ont experimente un temps suffisant) a reconnaitre la rt-alite\ndes phe'nomenes. M. Lodge, apires avoir mentionne' les incertitudes du\ncontrole, dit avec raison : \"Occurrences too close to the medium, and\nin the dark, must remain open to some shadow of this doubt ; but with\npatience and more sittings it is extremely unlikely that such dubious\nphenomena will be the only ones displayed. Sometimes the thing\nmoved will be beyond the reasonable range of any such hypothesis ;\nsometimes there will be light enough to see that there is no normal\ncontact ; and, as in my case also, sometimes one will feel the suspicious\ncontact while one has hold oneself of both hands and both feet of the\nmedium, with the head visible, or otherwise under control ; in fact,\nsooner or later, the thing will occur in such a way as to render the\nhypothesis of self-deception the only one possible, short of admitting\nthe fact as it is.\" (Report, p. 321 .)\nQue re'pond M. le Dr. Hodgson a cette experience ? II re'pond\ncomme toujours par une question : \" comment les mains et les pieds ont\ne'tt! tenus ? \" et il passe outre. Pense-t-il qu'il est reellement possible,.\na un homme normal, de croire qu'il tient les deux mains lorsqu'il n'a\nqu'une seule, ou de prendre sa propre main pour celle d'autrui 1\nJe me rappelle, que pendant une de nos experiences (le 25 Aout,\n1894) M. le Prof. Sidgwick de'clarait etre sur de la main gauche j\nM. le Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing affirmait qu'il tenait bien la main\ndroite et touchait la tete ; moi je tenais les deux jambes avec mes deux\nmains, et en outre M.

'\n\f82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, [MAT, 1895.\nOne new Member and three new Associates were elected, whose\nnames and addresses are given above. The elections of seven new\nAssociates of the American Branch was recorded.\nThe Council recorded with regret the death of Mr. J. Shuttle-\nworth, an Associate of the Society.\nVarious other matters having been discussed, the Council agreed\nthat its next meeting should be at the Rooms of the Society, 19,\nBuckingham-street, W. C., on Friday, May 17th, at 4.30 p.m.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 72nd General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, April 5th, at 4 p. m. ; Professor\nSidgwick in the chair.\nPROFESSOR SIDGWICK apologised for the unavoidable absence of\nProfessor Barrett, who had been unable to complete his paper owing\nto press of work arising from the illness of his colleagues at\nDublin.\nMR. F. W. H. MYERS then read and commented on various cases of\nPremonition, received by the Society since the last discussion of the\nsubject. It is intended to publish in Proceedings XXVIII., in July,\nthese and other cases embodied in a paper on \" The Relation to Time\nof Subliminal Faculty.\" In introducing the cases, Mr. Myers\nremarked that the evidence for precognition was now much stronger\nthan when Mrs. Sidgwick published her paper in 1888. Especially\nthere was now a certain infusion of actual experiment into this branch\nof the inquiry, owing to the occasional perception in crystals or other\nspecula of visions of future events. There had been several cases of\nsuch prevision, and he earnestly hoped that very many more\nexperiments of the kind would be made.\nA number of cases of organic prediction were then read. The\nspeaker urged that it was inherently probable that the subliminal self,\npossessing a profounder knowledge of the organism, would also be\nable to form a more certain prognosis. Many predictions of disease\nor death might thus be predictions only in the sense in which a\nphysician's prognosis predicts the events which his trained observation\ninfers from existing facts.\nIn other cases, where a prediction of death, perhaps at some\ndistant date, was known to the subject of the prediction, it was an\ninteresting question how far, and by what organic mechanism, his\nown self-suggestion tended to bring about the fulfilment of the\n\fMAT, 1895.] General Meeting. 83\nprophecy. If he was visibly made depressed and anxious, vitality\nwould of course be lowered ; but where there was no visible\nconstitutional effect, it seemed a good deal of power to attribute to\nself-suggestion if we supposed it capable of actually arresting the\nheart. He (the speaker) would be glad to hear of any hypnotic\nexperiments in slowing the pulse, besides those of Professor Beaunis.\nIn other cases, again, the prediction was either unknown to the\nsubject, or was fulfilled in what seemed an accidental manner.\nQuoting a remarkable narrative from Dr. Wiltse, where a series of\npictures foreshadowed the accidental death of a man entirely\nunknown to the seer, the speaker remarked that in such pictures,\nextraneously presented, we had the nearest approach to a revelation\nof destiny ; and consequently the best opportunity for actual\nexperiment as to whether destiny\u2014or this prefigurement of it\u2014was\nin fact modifiable by man's will or not.\nDR. MILNE BBAMWELL, commenting on Mr. Myers' remarks, said\nthat the lowering of the pulse by suggestion was an experiment which\nhe had frequently repeated. In one case, the sphygmographic\ntracing showed a lowering from 60 or 70 to 40, the pulse then being\nraised to 150, and he was disposed to think that the limits were\ndefined solely by his own fears as to the safety of the patient. In this\ncase, he had merely suggested that the pulse should beat slower or faster,\nand did not know what mental mechanism was used by the patient to\neffect the result. In another case he produced the same effect, not by\n-direct suggestion, but by suggesting, e.g., in order to raise the pulse\nrate, that the patient was running to catch a train, carrying a heavy\nhag, etc., and then lowered the pulse by depressing ideas, such as that\nthe patient was ill, bankrupt, etc. He had recently tried a similar\n\u2022experiment in Dr. Waller's laboratory, and raised the pulse of the\npatient 20 per cent. In these cases it is suggestion that evokes the\nphenomenon, so that where suggestion can operate we cannot regard\nthe fore-seeing of a result as genuine premonition. The prediction\nshould relate to some one other than the person making it, and should\nbe unknown to the person concerned.\nWith regard to the possible influence of suggestion in bringing\nabout death, he did not know through his personal experience of any\ncase where the idea that death would occur at a specific time was\nrealised, but he knew of cases where the statement of the doctor\nhad had a serious effect. He had been acquainted with two medical\npractitioners, one of whom, though his treatment was old-fashioned\nand unenlightened, being of a cheerful disposition, always led his\npatients to think they would recover; while the other, a much\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1895.\ncleverer and more scientific man, unfortunately took a depressed view\nof his cases, and inspired the patients and their attendants with\ngloomy prognostications. The first saved a large percentage of his\ncases, and the second had a marked effect in increasing the mortality\nin that town.\nPROFESSOR SIDGWICK referred to a story he had often heard\u2014\nthough not on good authority\u2014of a criminal who was told that he\nwould be bled to death, and had his eyes bandaged and an\ninsignificant puncture made and warm water trickled down his arm,\nin consequence of which he died. He asked Dr. Bramwell whether\nhe knew any facts tending to show that this was likely to be true.\nDR. BRAMWELL had heard variations of the same story, and\nthought it quite possible that death might be produced in this way.\nMR. H. A. SMITH said that similar cases were asserted to occur in\nsome tribes\u2014of South Sea Islanders, he thought\u2014a prediction of\ndeath in case of certain events being made and the man in question\ndying accordingly. But his impression was that the man who died\nalways knew of the prediction. He asked Mr. Myers with reference\nto the lady who predicted her death in five years, whether there was\nany medical evidence as to the cause of death, and how exact the\nperiod was. He also enquired whether in cases of delirium tremens\nany accurate predictions of the termination of the fit were known,\nto have been made. If it were true that in some cases of insanity\nfore-knowledge had been shown of the issue of the complaint, it might\nbe so in allied conditions. He had heard of some cases of the kind,\nand thought the subject might be worth investigation by doctors.\nMR. MYERS said that the lady's husband died on April 28th,\n1888, and she herself died on July 29th, 1893. The illness was bilious\nfever, and the death apparently occurred from exhaustion afterwards.\nIt was no doubt true that a prediction relating to some other\nperson was of more value as evidence for premonition than a similar\nprediction relating to the percipient himself, but in the former case\nthere still might be doubt as to whether the seeds of disease were not\nalready present. He referred to Professor Richet's paper in the\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. V., p. 18, giving an account of diagnoses of\ndiseases and predictions of results made by professional clairvoyants\nin several cases, with a greater proportion of success than Professor\nRichet thought could be attributed to chance. He also referred to\nthe diagnoses and prognoses professing to be made by a spirit through\n\"Miss A.,\" many of which had been remarkably successful. It was\nunfortunate that in many cases of this kind the evidence could not b&\npublished.\n\fMAT, 1895.] The Holywell \" Cures.\" 85\nPROFESSOR SIDGWICK wished to suggest one more point to Mr.\nMyers in regard to predictions in the cases which he had communi\ncated to the meeting. Was the prediction always told beforehand to\nsome other person? The possibility of a pseudo-memory as the\nexplanation of some premonitions had been strongly urged in some\nquarters.\nMR. MYERS replied that no doubt paramnesia was a danger to be\nguarded against. He thought that it was put forward in an extreme\nform, when it was urged that a pseudo-memory might not only\nrelate to a dream which had not occurred, but to a repeating of this\ndream to a party at breakfast which had never taken place ; but, as\na matter of fact, even this extreme form was guarded against in the\ncases he had narrated, since there was always evidence from a second\nperson to whom the prediction had been communicated before\nfulfilment.\nTHE HOLYWELL \"CURES.\"\nBY THE REV. A. T. FRYER.\nAt Holywell, there is a well, a legend, and \" cures.\" The well is\ncertainly ancient and provides a never-failing supply of water at the\nrate of from ten to twenty tons per minute. The water is good, it\nmaintains an average temperature of fifty-six degrees, but there are\nno peculiar properties to account for the healing which some persons\nhave derived from bathing in it. The Duke of Westminster has leased\nthe well to the Corporation for a thousand years, and it is now sub-let\nto the Jesuit order. The history of the well before the twelfth century\nis wrapped in obscurity. The handsome building erected over the well\nwas put up by the mother of Henry VII. in 1498.\nPilgrims in their thousands have gone to Holywell during the\nyear 1894 ; they have been told that, whatever their complaints,\nthey may hope for cure provided they exercise faith (in God, St. Wine-\nfred, and our Lady), and make due use of the waters. Some bathe, others\ndrink, many apply the water to their eyes or other diseased members ;\nall are encouraged to hope by the spectacle of crutches and other\nmementoes left behind by favoured pilgrims of this and the last two\n\u2022centuries. The pilgrims are told the story of St. Winefred, praise\nworthy care being taken to distinguish between the probable and the\nuncertain elements of the legend, and a great deal of reliance upon her\ngood offices is inculcated. The legend in brief is that St. Winefred,\nafter being committed to the care of St. Beuno by her father, Theuith,\nand mother, Gwenlo, and receiving instruction from the saint, was one\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAT, 1895\nday brutally attacked by Caradoc, son of Alyn, who cut off her head.\nCaradoc fell down dead and was swallowed up by the earth; but St..\nWinefred's head rolled down the hill and rested where St. Beuno was\nsaying Mass. There a spring burst forth, and presently St. Beuno\nreunited head and body, and St. Winefred lived for fifteen years after,\nthe head of a community at Gwytherin. Such is the legend : the\nexplanation of it is another matter. Archdeacon Thomas sees in the\nlegend and the possible origin of the spring closely connected lines of\nderivation ; the natural history being transferred or paralleled in the\nlegend. The theory involves some philological difficulties, but may yet\nreceive fuller attention.*\nComing to the occurrences of to-day, it is fair to ask whether the\ncures are of such a character as to warrant all that has been said about\nthem in the public press, and further, whether the records, so far as\nthey are true, present any phenomena not to be found in connection\nwith faith- and science-healing, hypnotism, suggestion, and other cura\ntive methods. In presenting the evidence, upon which readers must\nexercise their own judgment, it must be premised that careful inquiry\ninto over fifty cases has shown that very few of the persons \" cured \"\nbelong to the educated classes. This is not said in disparagement of\nthose good people, of whose bona fides no doubt has been raised, but\nby way of caution, and to show that care must be exercised in receiving\nthe statements which the newspapers have freely inserted without\nattempting to examine the evidence. To the possible objection that\nthere is no gainsaying the facts, and that, if one sees a patient borne\nhelpless into the well and coming out again without any assistance, the\ncure is self-evident, and needs no further inquiry, it is sufficient to\nanswer that simulation and hysteria are far too common to lead the\nexperienced to accept even such evidence without very careful diagnosis\nand knowledge of the patient's previous history.\nOn my first visit to the well, August 29th, 1894, I saw Father\nBeauclerck, S.J., who expressed his willingness to aid any inquiry into\nthe cures conducted by the S.P.R., and hoped that medical men would\ngive their assistance in the investigation. At the midday service, held\nat the well, he preached, and during his discourse alluded to the work\nof the S.P.R. in establishing the probability of thought-transference,\nand distinctly said that the cures were not to be held as miracles unless\nby decision of the Bishop after careful inquiry. After the service\nmany of the men present bathed, whilst others drank of the water, and\nmany took supplies away for home use. One patient described to me his\n* Further archaeological information and discussion of the legend of St. Winefred\nis to be found in an article published in The Church Times, of January 4th, 1895.\n\fMAT, 1895.] The Holywell \" Cures.\" 87\ncure of hernia, but neither then nor in subsequent correspondence would\nhe give satisfactory evidence of medical examination before or after the\ncure. The hernia was of long standing. The one remarkable feature in\nthe behaviour of the crowd was intense hope, and many expressed earnest\nfaith in the goodwill of St. Winefred towards all sufferers. At my\nsecond visit, September 14th, 1894, the crowd was much larger and the\nexcitement increased, owing to recent cures. On this occasion I visited\nthe Hospice and interviewed several of the patients, particularly J. H.\n(No. 27), who was gaining strength in his limbs and partial recovery\nof his voice, after an attack of paralysis through fright. A gentle\nman who has known him for some years, however, has just\nreported to me (February 1st, 1895) :\u2014\"I have seen J.H. ; he looks a\nlittle better and his speech is perhaps a trifle clearer, but he is quite\nunable to follow his employment. His mother tells me that\nhe is worse than before he went to the well.\" Another\npatient, J. H. (No. 26) reported himself as getting back his voice,\nlost through an attack of influenza, and has, since his return, taken\na place in the choir as a bass singer. I can get no definite\nmedical evidence of the cure, only a letter from an assistant-\nsurgeon who says that six weeks before October 15th he noticed that\nJ. H.'s voice was \" very defective.\" The general appearance of the\npatients was very similar to that of the groups one sees at a convalescent\nhome. The sisters seemed very attentive, and did all in their power,\nI heard, to encourage hope of recovery.\nIn accordance with the method observed by the S.P.R. in making\nreports of inquiries, the following account of cases is confined to those\nabout which a trustworthy medical opinion has been received. The\nplan followed in making investigation was to note every case reported in\nthe newspapers, and ask the patient for an autographic account of the\ncure and the name of the medical attendant who was acquainted with\nthe case and had seen the patient after the cure. If the name of the\nmedical man was sent, application was made direct to him for his\nopinion, but I regret that several men have not seen their way to\nsending any answer to my inquiries, always made in the name of the\nSociety.\nMost of the patients belong to some religious body, and are by no\nmeans all Roman Catholics, but as the cures are evidently in some\nmeasure the result of faith and suggestion they are, presumably, more\nlikely to transpire in the cases of persons who habitually exercise the\nfaculty of faith and submit to influence. The present report has been\ndrawn up with a view to encouraging a serious medical experiment, and\nis not, of course, to be considered in any other than a scientific aspect.\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

T. FBYEE.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nON EXPERIMENTS WITH EUSAPIA PALADINO.\nThe following letter has been received by Mr. Myers :\u2014\n4, Cranmer-road, Cambridge, March 25th, 1895.\n. . . I have just been reading Dr. Hodgson's criticism on the report,\nand the replies to it. I think it may be admitted that he has put what I\nmay call the physical jugglery hypothesis in as plausible a way as is\npossible, and most people after reading the replies, if not before, will\nnevertheless feel that it is quite insufficient to account for the facts. But\nit seems to me that neither Dr. Hodgson nor Professor Lodge takes sufficient\naccount of the psychological side of the matter. They refer to the\nhypotheses of collective hallucination and hypnotisation only to dismiss them\nat once ; but it appears to me that such objections to them as are evident\non the face of it apply only to gross and exaggerated forms of the\nhypotheses, and that when moderately stated the great drawback to a\npsychological explanation is that it seems to explain too much\u2014there is\napparently hardly anything which it could not be made to explain, and\ngreat difficulty in devising any way of practically testing or refuting it.\nThe obvious objection to the hypothesis of collective hallucination is\nthe improbability that four normal persons should at the same time have\nsuch \"completely externalised\" hallucinations as would seem to be\nnecessary to explain the reported phenomena. On the other hand, the\nobjection to the hypothesis of hypnotisation is that there is no reason for\nsupposing the observers, and still less the note-taker outside, to have been\nin any abnormal state. But we may put the hypothesis that the observers\nwere not in any abnormal state, but were merely under the influence of\n\"suggestion\" so far that they mistook slight indications for clear\nperceptions, or rather converted the former into the latter. The theory is\ngaining ground that, so far from the hypnotic state being a necessary\n\f94 JourrtMl of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1895.\n\u2022condition for the influence of suggestion, it is itself merely a suggested\ncondition. It is certain that subjects, at any rate who are accustomed to\nbeing hypnotised, may be influenced by suggestions from others, even to the\nextent of having marked hallucinations of perception, without passing\nthrough any period of hypnotic sleep or trance, and without any break in\ntheir chain of memories. So that it is quite possible that people may be\nmuch more open to \" suggestion \" than is commonly supposed; and even\nthat hallucinatory percepts may be suggested to them, of a trivial nature,\nwithout their ever finding it out. Of course it is not to be expected that\nthis would happen often, for our faculty of perception is adjusted to our\nnormal environment, and it would only be on the occurrence of abnormal\ncircumstances that such self-suggestions would be likely to deceive us.\nEven on the hypothesis that such suggestions may be received telepathically\nfrom others, they would much more often be suggestions of truth than of\nfalsehood. Personally, I am inclined to believe that expectations, pre\nconceived ideas, inferences,\u2014in a word, \"suggestions,\"\u2014have much more to\ndo with even our most ordinary perceptions than is generally admitted by\npsychologists\u2014as witness those geometrical designs which one can at will\n\"see\" with either one or another corner to the front. It would not, I\nthink, be difficult to draw up a progressive series of phenomena between\nthese simple illusions and the most developed hallucinations suggested to a\nhypnotised subject, or the most realistic \" phantasms of the living,\" tracing\nin them all that natural tendency of the human mind to believe objectively\nwhat it thinks subjectively, which Mr. Balfour calls the influence of\nAuthority.\nWe do not precisely know what are the conditions most favourable to the\naction of suggestion, but if we once admit that it may act without the\nsubject being in any \" abnormal \" state, or having submitted himself to any\nprocess of hypnotisation, it seems not improbable that the state of\nexpectancy and absence of distracting perceptions which obtains at a\nconjuring performance, or still more perfectly at a mediumistic seance, is\none of those conditions. For the hypothesis affords an explanation of the\nsuccess of many conjuring tricks, the purely physical explanations of\nwhich, as given by the conjurers themselves, seem highly unsatisfactory.\nFor example, Mr. Davey's explanations of how his tricks were done, though\nthey do not profess to be complete, show pretty clearly that his methods\ncould not have deceived any one whose perceptions represented the actual\noccurrences to him in the way they would normally be expected to do. I\nhave myself seen the \"basket trick\" done in India, under circumstances\nwhere it seemed that nothing short of a negative hallucination would\naccount for the escape of the boy from the basket unseen, and his appear\nance behind a cactus hedge ten yards or so behind, the whole intervening\nspace of bare ground being, as I thought, under my close observation\nall the time. This trick is a very common one, and not so striking as many\nothers that have been reported ; but it will serve to illustrate one argument\nagainst the purely physical, and in favour of some psychological explanation\nof such tricks ; namely, that, though a purely physical trick might succeed\non many occasions or before a small audience, if a juggler were found out\non one occasion in ten, or by one person in a dozen, his occupation would\n.soon be gone. If the juggler had merely distracted my attention by beating\n\fMAT, 1895.] Correspondence. 95\n\u2022the tom-tom, he might have let the boy out of the basket while I was\nlooking away\u2014but he could hardly calculate on always getting such a chance,\nand if the audience consisted of many people, it is hardly possible that he\nwould ever get a chance at all, unless we admit the hypothesis that the\nsuggestion to look away, or not to see, operated on all the spectators at once,\nin a manner which at once recalls what is called \" suggestion \" in connection\nwith hypnotism. (For I do not suppose that any one would suggest that\nthis common trick is performed by de-materialising and then re-materialising\nthe boy.)\nI cannot, of course, pretend to apply this hypothesis to explain in detail\n^ill the phenomena observed with Eusapia. I do not suppose that everything\n\u2022could be explained by suggestion\u2014probably it would be necessary to assume\nmore or less conscious or unconscious trickery on Eusapia's part as well.\nBut if she did her tricks by mere jugglery, such as Dr. Hodgson describes,\nit is impossible but that she should make mistakes and be found out every\nnow and then ; whereas if all that the jugglery has to do is to supply points\nde repere, as it were, for the suggested hallucinatory percepts to form round,\nthe only sort of failure to be expected would be what actually occurs, viz.,\nthat on some occasions there are no, or next to no, manifestations of force,\nand movements of Eusapia are observed which bear a suspicious character\n(see Dr. Ochorowicz's reply to Dr. Hodgson, \" la fraude re'flexe,\" Journal for\nMarch and April, p. 77).\nBut the hypothesis might be made to explain so many reported phenomena\nbesides Eusapia's that it behoves us to discuss it thoroughly, and, if possible,\nfind some crucial test by which we may make sure that \" suggestion \" has\nnot, as it were, been \"cooking\" the reports in any particular case. The\nonly practical proposal I can make is one which has already been made by\nDr. Hodgson, viz., that each of the observers should write an independent\nreport immediately after each sitting. Of course suggestion might even then\noperate in the same way on each of the observers\u2014and it would be especially\nlikely to do so if they were in the habit of calling out their observations in\norder to have them taken down by a note-taker outside the room. I would\ntherefore suggest that, a series having already been taken with a note-taker,\nit would be well to try a further series without one ; in which every possible\nprecaution was taken to keep the observers' minds independent of each other.\nThey might, for example, arrange so that one observer did all the holding\nduring one experiment, so that it would not be necessary to call out \" mains\nbien tenties,\" &c., and the light might be turned up after anything had hap\npened to allow each observer to make his own notes. In this way almost\ncomplete silence could be kept as to what phenomena were occurring and the\ninfluence of suggestion might then be expected to show itself in discrepancies\nin the reports. Another method of attaining the same result, which would\nbe even more satisfactory if it were practicable, would be to have a number\nof independent observers posted outside the room, unknown to the medium,\nand, if possible, to the sitters also, looking through holes in the walls or\n\u2022ceiling ; but this would be difficult to arrange, even if the seance room was\nsufficiently illuminated to allow anything to be clearly seen. But I think\nthe most hopeful way of testing the hypothesis would be in reference to\nother and specially arranged experiments. A valuable beginning has already\nbeen made by Mr. Davey ; and perhaps the most promising field for investi\ngation for the S.P.R. lies in testing the \"possibilities of mal-observation,\"\nor, as I should prefer to put it, \" the possibilities of suggestion.\" Until\nsuch possibilities can be excluded, it will never seem to me \" even money \"\nthat such phenomena as are reported in D. D. Home's case or Eusapia's\nindicate the existence of any new Forces in Nature.\nEDWABD T. DIXON.\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAT, 1895.\nDIPSOMANIA AND HYPNOTISM.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nSir, \u2014May I be allowed to refer to the article under the above title in\nPart XXVII of the Proceedings ? The subject of Dipsomania comes within\nthe scope of the Society for Psychical Research solely in connection with\nhypnotism as a curative agent. The cases quoted by Dr. J. Gordon Dill are\nof striking interest and importance. In introducing them, however, Dr.\nGordon Dill makes a general remark on Dipsomania which appears to me to\nbe fraught with considerable danger to the moral perceptions of the commu\nnity, if put forward without some qualification. The latter part of the first\nparagraph is as follows :\u2014\n\" Now it cannot be too strongly insisted upon that habitual drunkenness\nis a disease,\u2014a moral, as opposed to an intellectual insanity, \u2014 and that no\nmatter how real the resolution to reform, or how intense the pangs of remorse\nfor the past may be, it is a positive fact that the power of resistance does not\nequal the impelling force of the temptation and craving to drink. The\ndrunkard, in other words, is not his own master.\"\nIt may be correct to call \"habitual drunkenness\" a \" disease \" and a\n\" moral insanity. \" But there can be no fair comparison between habitual\ndrunkenness and any ordinary form of mental or physical disease. It is easy to>\nshow one essential difference. It would be great presumption in any one to\nsay \"I never will have epilepsy,\"\u2014\"I never will have any form of religious\nor acute mania.\" But there is no presumption in any young man or woman,\ngrowing up to years of discretion, saying, \" I never will be a dipsomaniac.\"\nDipsomania is a result of one of our social customs, in the first place volun\ntarily conformed to. Were that custom abandoned, dipsomania would cease\nto exist. There is therefore, it seems to me, a danger of weakening the\nmoral sense and responsibility both of individuals and of society, by classify\ning it with forms of disease and insanity over which we are able to exercise\nonly limited control.\nEDWARD T.

My wife wag not feeling well when I left, and after\nI had started I looked back and saw her standing in the door looking\ndisconsolate and sad at my leaving. The picture haunted me all day, and\nat night, before I went to bed, I thought I would try to find out if possible\nher condition. I had undressed, and was sitting on the edge of the bed,\nwhen I covered my face with my hands and willed myself in Lakewood at\nhome to see if I could see her. After a little, I seemed to be standing in\nher room before the bed, and saw her lying there looking much better. I\nfelt satisfied she was better, and so spent the week more comfortably\nregarding her condition. On Saturday I went home. When she saw me,\nshe remarked, \" I don't know whether I am glad to see you or not, for I\nthought something had happened to you. I saw you standing in front of\nthe bed the night (about 8.30 or before 9) you left, as plain as could be, and\nI have been worrying myself about you ever since. I sent to the office and\nto the depot daily to get some message from you.\" After explaining my\neffort to find out her condition, everything became plain to her. She had\nseen me when I was trying to see her and find out her condition. I thought\nat the time I was going to see her and make her see me.\nB. F. SINCLAIR.\nMrs. Sinclair writes :\u2014\nI remember this experience well. I saw him as plain as if he had been\nthere in person. I did not see him in his night clothes, but in a suit that\nhung in the closet at home. It made me very anxious, for I felt that some\naccident or other had befallen him. I was on the rack all the time till\nSaturday, and if he had not come home then, I should have sent to him to\nfind out if anything was wrong.\nH. M.

At the time in question I was living at\nthe Seven Stars house in Lakewood, going to and from my work and\nstabling my horse at father's.

A\u00ab Pn Auditory.\nFrom Mrs. Manning, who writes to Professor James as follows :\u2014\n105, Winter Street, Portland, Maine, October 28th [1894],\nDear Sir,\u2014At the request of Colonel Woodhull, I send you the following\nstatement, which I hope may be of use to you.\nWhen I was a child at my home in Rochester, N.Y., my elder sister had1\nalmost entire care of me. At night, after putting me in bed, she would sit\nbeside me for a few moments until I fell asleep. Frequently I would wake up,\nand finding myself alone and in the dark, of which I was much afraid, I\nwould call out to her ; she would come and soothe me to sleep again. In 1875,\nI was living at Fort Hartsuff, Nebraska, a military post, the station of my\nhusband. Our nearest railway station was Grand Island, on the Union\nPacific Railroad, 75 miles away. My sister then lived at Omaha, about\n300 miles east of Grand Island. Our mail reached us by buckboard from Grand\nIsland every Wednesday and Saturday. One night in November, I awoke\nfrom a dreamless sleep, wide awake, and yet to my own consciousness the\nlittle child of years ago, in my own room in the old home ; the sister had\ngone, and I was alone in the darkness. I sat up in bed, and called with all\nmy voice, \"Jessie ! Jessie !\"\u2014my sister's name. This aroused my husband,\nwho spoke to me. I seemed to come gradually to realisation of my sur\nroundings, and with difficulty adjusted myself to the present.

For days after this the\nstrange impression was with me, and I could recall many little incidents and\n\u2022scenes of child-life that I had entirely forgotten.\nI wrote to my sister the next day, and told her of the strange experience\nof the night before. In a few days I received a letter from her, the date\nthe same as mine,and having passed mine on the way, in which she said that\n\u2022such a strange thing had happened the night before ; that she had been\nawakened by my voice calling her name twice ; that the impression was so\nstrong that her husband went to the door to see if it could possibly be I.\nNo one else had called her ; she had not been dreaming of me.

[JCNE, 1895.\nsomething dreadful had occurred at home. In fact, a servant had fallen\nthrough a glass cupola into the tenement beneath, and had killed herself.\nBut the odd thing was that the maid's sister and a gentleman interested in\nthe house where the accident had occurred both arrived before the ill news\nhad reached them, both averring that they had a presentiment of evil. So\nhere were three coincident forebodings in one case, all fulfilled.\nMr. Myers made enquiries about the case and received the following\nletter from the husband of the first percipient :\u2014\nJune 16th, 1892.\nDear Sir,\u2014After receiving yours of 18th inst., I wrote to our mutual\nfriend Andrew Lang for the date of the Longman in which he had related\nthe incident to which you refer. He has now sent me the paragraph and I\ncan safely say that the story is accurately told.\nIn June, 1880, I was living with my wife and family in Edinburgh, in\njust such a flat as is described ; the occupant of the house below being\nMr. S .\nMy wife and I had been from home on a Friday to Monday visit, and\nwhen on our return homewards, about half-an-hour by rail from Edinburgh,\nmy wife suddenly exclaimed, \"I am certain something dreadful has\nhappened at home.\" She seemed so positive that I was much impressed\nand somewhat anxious.\nOn our arrival at home, we found that our unfortunate table-maid had\nbeen killed in the manner stated by Mr. Lang, and that, as nearly as we\ncould ascertain, at the exact moment when my wife felt the presentiment\nthat something dreadful had occurred.\nSoon after I met Mr. B , who told me the circumstances under which\nhe had gone to Mr. S 's house at the time of the accident.\nAs however, I thought you would like his account at first hand, I wrote\nto him for it and now enclose it.\nWe were at the time informed that a sister of the unfortunate girl, who\nwas a nursemaid in Edinburgh, had arrived quite unexpectedly at the time\nof the accident, and stated that she had felt drawn to the place by a feeling\nof anxiety about her sister.\nI have, unfortunately, no knowledge of what became of this girl, and the\nservants who reported the incident to us are now scattered far and wide. I\nmay say, however, that personally I have no doubt that the account then\ngiven to us of wh at she said was absolutely true.\nThe writer enclosed the following letter from his friend, Mr. B., to\nhimself.\nJune Uth, 1894.\nSo far as I am concerned, the facts as to the death of the girl in S 'a\nhouse are few and simple.\nS and his wife were abroad, and he had asked me to take an occasional\nlook at his house, to see that all was going well.\nOn the day in question, I was sitting writing at my desk here (I write\nfrom my office), when, by a sudden impulse, the reason of which I never\n\fJONE, 1895.] Cases Received by the Literary Committee. 103\ncould make out, I laid down my pen, put on my hat, and went straight down\nto St. street.

I said, \" Well, J\u2014\u2022\u2014, everything going on all right ? \" He\nsaid only, \"Look here, sir,\" and led the way into the inner hall, where there\nwas something covered with a white sheet. He removed the cloth, and there\nlay the poor girl dreadfully mangled. There could be no doubt as to death\nbeing instantaneous, so I wrote a note to the police authorities to come and\nmake the necessary investigation, and came away. That is all I can say.\nUndoubtedly there was something strange which made me hurry away in\nthe middle of my writing to this catastrophe ; but I had no presentiment of\nanything evil having happened. I think your estimate of the year and day\nmust be about correct.\nMCI. 92. Visual.\nThe following case of apparent clairvoyance with regard to the\narrival of a letter was sent to us the day after it occurred by Mrs.\nVenn ; the percipient being her son, a boy of about ten years of age.\nMrs. Venn writes :\u2014\ns 3, St. Peter's-terrace, Cambridge, January 9th, 1895.\nJanuary 8th, I came down to breakfast ; A. was sitting at the table,\nDr. Venn was not in the room.

I dreamed a dream and\nwoke with it, and he immediately (asleep still) in his sleep began to talk\nabout it, proving that he was dreaming the same thing. It was a very queer\ndream, and involved the question of haw many inches (of a row of candles)\nshould be cut off each candle. He gravely begged me to \"cut off six inches,\ndo, mamma \" ; when I was feeling tour would be enough. It was a fete in\nour dream, and we were lighting up some room.

Saturday morning, at Hamburg, Iowa, three days after\nwards, the enclosed message came to me. Now I must tell you some other\nparticulars connected with it, which are part, and a remarkable part, of the\noccurrence and experience.\nMy mother was taken ill Wednesday night, soon after going to bed,\u2014a\ndifficulty in breathing, which she had experienced more or less since an\nattack of \" la grippe \" four years ago.

Ad Pn Auditory.\nThe following is a case of raps heard at the time of a death, and\nnoted at the time, related by M. Erny, author of Le Psychisme\nExperimental.\nHe writes to Mr. Myers :\u2014\n34, Rue Labruyere, Paris, March 5th, 1895.\n.... Here is a very curious phenomenon which occurred to me in\n\u2022Switzerland. In 1893, I was at Interlaken, and amusing myself very much,\nand very far from psychic ideas. One evening (not night), I heard three\nraps, and as it is the usual sign for advertisement, I waited to see if it would\ncome again, for I supposed it might come from neighbours. Again I heard\nthe three raps, and this time I remarked that it was on the wood of my bed.\nThen it was evident that it was a premonition.\nWhen I came back to Paris, I found on my bureau a letter from a\ncousin, who announced to me the death of an aunt at Brest. The day of\ndeath was the same day when I was averti at Interlaken, for I took the\nprecaution to write the day on my travel book.\nI had no news of that aunt for three months, and did not suppose that\nthe premonition was for her. On the contrary, I thought immediately of\nanother relation who was in a town where there was an epidemic.\nA.

There are, and were, two wardrobes in the room, the\nrelative positions to the bed being as shown : \u2014\nA\nWardrobe A\nBed\nAll at once I saw my son, or rather what I felt convinced was my\nson, lying on his back on a shelf in the wardrobe with the next shelf above\ntouching him. He moved his body as if in pain ; and moved his head so\n\fJUNE, 1895.] Cases Received by the Literary Committee. 109 \u2022\nthat his face was sometimes towards me, and sometimes turned away from\nme. I remember thinking, and I thought that I also spoke, thus :\u2014 \" You\nare altogether too closely confined in there ; I must have you out of that.\"\nHowever, I did not move, and presently, the vision faded.\nStill lying in bed, and still self-conscious, I saw the same apparently\nreal presence of my son on a shelf in wardrobe B. He was then much\nquieter, and did not move his head as described before, yet still looked as\nif in great pain.\nI believe that I remained in the same position, and that my eyes were\nnot directed to wardrobe B, and yet I seemed to be looking straight at him.\nAgain, the vision faded.\nWhen I arose in the morning, I was painfully conscious of what had\ntranspired in the night, and was for some weeks in constant dread of hearing\nthat an accident had befallen my son. Then a letter from him relieved my\nfears. In it he narrated how, by the breaking of a rotten rope, he had\nfallen from aloft, and was nearly killed. He gave the latitude and longitude\nand the day and hour. On making the proper chronological allowance, I\nfound that the accident in the Pacitic and my vision occurred at the same time.\nOn his return at the end of the voyage, before I told him of my experi\nence, I asked him for full particulars. He said that after he fell, some of\nthe crew lifted him up. The captain, who was a brutal fellow, saw them\nand said, \"Let [him] alone, he'll come to presently.

In fact, when the face was uppermost, his nose touched the spar.\nOn this I asked him if he kept still. He said that he did not, owing to\ngreat pain, and that each time he swung his head, his nose touched the spar.\nI then asked him to indicate the relative positions of [the] spar and the bunk to\nwhich he was afterwards carried.

[JUNE, 1895.\n\"soon after\" in The English Mechanic and World of Science. From\nthis paper, of October 7th, 1887, we extract the account referred to.\nHe there calls it \" a recent experience of my own.\"\nI had a son\u2014a lad of sixteen\u2014at sea in the capacity of an apprentice on\nboard a British barque. One night, while in bed, I suddenly awoke, and\nsaw with great distinctness an apparition of the upper half of my eon\nstretched out on his back on a flat surface by the bedside. He appeared as\nif in his usual working dress, and I saw his features without the slightest\nobscurity. He was apparently writhing in pain, and yet unable to do more\nthan move his head a little. Although I seemed to see him close to me, I\nyet felt that I was powerless to help, and this sense of inability caused me\nextreme mental distress. After a while the vision faded, and a period\nelapsed that I cannot correctly estimate. Then I again saw his form, prone\nas before, and with the features still indicating great pain ; but this time it\nwas at the opposite end of the room. The consciousness of inability to\nrelieve still possessed me, till the vision faded and I fell asleep. On\nawaking in the morning I had a clear recollection of the painful vision, and\nfor weeks I could not shake off the impression that my son had sustained\nsome serious injury. At last, to my great rolief, a letter from him came to\nhand. In it was narrated rather briefly how he had fallen to the deck in\nconsequence of the breaking of a rotten rope on which he was hauling, and\nthat in consequence he was totally helpless for more than a week. I had\nnot recorded the exact date of the vision, but as nearly as I could make out\nat the time of reading the letter, the date corresponded with that of the\naccident. On his return home, I eagerly asked my boy for the particulars\nof the occurrence, taking care not to put leading questions, and to keep him\nignorant of my experience till he had told me all. I learned that he was\nstunned by the concussion, and that the first thing he was conscious of was\nthat some persons were lifting him up. Finding him helpless, they laid him\ndown again on the deck. The captain presently came and asked him if any\nbones were broken, to which he could only indistinctly reply. Then the\ncaptain told some one to draw him to one side of the deck, and said that he\nwould come all right in a few hours. The poor lad remained there without\nattention until some sympathetic member of the crew careful!y lifted him\nfrom where he was lying and carried him to his bunk in the deckhouse,\nwhere he lay for eight days. Making further ei quiry, and takmg the\nchronological difference into account, I found that the accident happened at\nan hour when I am usually in bed. Having thus stated the facts, I direct\nattention particularly to the coincidence (1st) in time of the accident and of\nmy consciousness of it ; (2nd) that my son lay for some time in two\ndifferent places, and that the apparition was thua seen by me, and (3rd) that\nhe felt most pain in his head and upper part of back, and this was evident\nto me at the time.\nSheerness-on-Sea. W. H. SHRUBSOLE.\nMr. Shrubsole writes to us further :\u2014\nSheerness-on-Sea, December 28th, 1894.\nI cannot remember that I spoke of the vision to any one before I found by\n\f1895.] Cases Received by the Literary Committee. I11\nletter that my son was still alive. It is probable that I did not, for Mrs.\n[Shrubsole was] then very unwell, and I did not want to alarm her. In\nexplanation of the declaration [printed below] being made, I may\nmention that I laid some very serious charges against the captain be\nfore the Board of Trade. There was a very long correspondence. The\nForeign Office made enquiry respecting malpractices in Chili, and the\nmember for East Kent and the late C. Bradlaugh brought up the subject in\nthe House of Commons several times. I find that my son first informed me\nof the accident by letter from Talcahuano dated April 10th, 1887.\n\\V. H. SHRUBSOLE.\nExtract from copy of declaration made at the Police-Court, Sheerness,\nby Harry Shrubsole, on May 23rd, 1889 : \u2014\nI, Harry Shrubsole, now residing at 64, High-street, Sheerness-on-Sea,\ndo solemnly and sincerely declare that I was an apprentice in the Merchant\nService on board the barque \"Killeena,\" of Glasgow. ... I further\ndeclare that on March 7th , 1887, I was on board the Killeena in Lat. 34. S\nand Lon. 84 W.\nBetween 9 and 10 a.m., I was in the main rigging hauling on the\nfall of a tackle (which was rotten, and had been spliced in two places) when\nit carried away, and I fell to the deck and became unconscious. On regaining\nsensibility, I found myself lying on my back under one of the spare spars\namidships. After a while Malinberg (the man who was afterwards illegally\nimprisoned at Talcahuano) came and lifted me up, and saying that he would\nnot let me lie there unattended any longer, he carried me to my bunk, where\nI lay helpless for eight days until the ship arrived at Talcahuano.\nHARRY SHRUBSOLE.\nFrom the whole evidence, it appears somewhat doubtful whether\nthe vision really took place at the time of the accident, and since the\ndate of the former was not noted, the doubt cannot now be cleared up.\nThe time of day was apparently not the same, as between 9 and 10 a.m.\nin Long. 84 W. would be nearly six hours later (not earlier, as Mr.\nShrubsole seems to have calculated) at Sheerness, i.e., between 3 and\n4 p.m. It seems certain, however, that the vision occurred some time\nbefore Mr. Shrubsole could have had any information of his son's condi\ntion by normal means.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nON EXPERIMENTS WITH EUSAPIA PALADINO.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OP THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\n38, Serghievskaia, St. Petersburg, April 26M\/ May 8th.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014May I be allowed to say a few words with regard to Mr.\nDixon's letter in the May Journal t\nMr. Dixon thinks that there is no sufficient evidence to show that the\nphysical phenomena of Spiritualism are not due to \" suggestion \" on the\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1895.\npart of the medium and to illusion or hallucination on the part of the sitters;\nand he suggests a series of experiments for the special purpose of testing\nthis hypothesis. I must say, I thought, before reading his letter, that this\nsame hypothesis had been disposed of long since. Surely no amount of\n\" suggestion \" can explain the over-turning of chairs in Dr. Dariex' experi\nments, in the absence of any recognised medium (Proceedings, Vol. VII.,\np. 194); or the direct writing obtained by Professor Alexander with the Davis\nchildren (Ibid, p. 173) ; or Mr. Crookes' experiment on the board and spring-\nbalance, which Mr. Dixon has apparently forgotten, since he says that the\n\"possibilities of suggestion\" were not excluded in D. D. Home's case ; or\nthe levitations of tables with Eusapia Paladino, which have been photographed.\nAnd I must certainly have forgotten many other cases telling just as\nstrongly against Mr. Dixon's hypothesis. There is no particle of evidence to\nsupport it. It has been disproved and refuted again and again ; and I confess\nit is somewhat discouraging to see that it comes to the front once more.\nI understand perfectly well an expert in conjuring like Mr. Richard\nHodgson, who sincerely believes and does his utmost to convince us that\nthe phenomena occurring in Eusapia's presence could have been produced\nby legerdemain. By so doing he renders a most important service, not only\nto the cause of truth, but even to the very phenomena the evidence for\nwhich he is trying to disparage ; for if Mr. Hodgson's critique had not\nappeared in the Journal, we should not have now the very conclusive and\nconvincing replies of Mr. Myers, Professor Lodge, M. Ch. Richet, and Dr.\nOchorowicz, which have cleared up all doubtful points and placed definitively\nEusapia's phenomena on a solid basis. For my own part I think that all\nstudents of \"psychical\" matters should heartily welcome all serious attempts\nto explain apparently abnormal phenomena by conjuring ; and that nothing\nbut good can come from a thorough discussion of all possible sources of errors\nin that line. For instance, though I do not at all believe that Eusapia could\nhave lifted the table with one of her feet or by means of a hook ; or that she\ncould have managed to get one of her hands free ; or that she had dummy\nhands and feet hidden about her\u2014yet I am very glad that these very points\nhave now been discussed, and I think that the possibilities of conjuring\nshould never be lost sight of in these matters. But I fail to see what would\nbe the use to devise experiments such as mentioned in Mr. Dixon's letter.\nIn my opinion it would be a mere waste of time, and, besides, would never\nsatisfy believers in \"suggestion,\" who would still be asking for more proofs,\nof the objective character of the phenomena, as if the evidence we already\npossess did not afford such proofs in abundance. Why do not those who hold\nMr. Dixon's views make experiments themselves ? It certainly devolves upon\nthem to prove that suggestion can act in the way they assert ; not upon\nothers to prove that it cannot. When they have brought forward an atom of\nevidence to support their hypothesis, it will be time to examine and discuss\nit. Meanwhile I prefer to adhere to the view that the testimony of three\nor four sane and intelligent persons is amply sufficient to establish the\nobjectivity\u2014I do not say the genuineness\u2014of any phenomenon. \u2014Believe\nme, dear sir, yours very truly,\nMICHAEL PETEOVO-SOLOVOVO.\n\fNo. CXXI.\u2014Vol. VII.

There\nwere also present, Professor W. F. Barrett, Colonel J. Hartley, Dr.\nWalter Leaf, Dr. A. Wallace, and Messrs. T. Barkworth, W. Crookes,\nF. W. H. Myers, F. Podmore, H. Arthur Smith, R. Pearsall Smith,\nand Sydney C. Scott.\nFive new Members and five new Associates, whose names and\naddresses are given above, were elected. The election of twenty-three\nnew Associates of the American Branch was recorded.\nThe decease of Mrs. Raphael, a member of the Society, was recorded\nwith regret.\nTwo presents to the library were on the table, for which a vote\nof thanks was passed to the donors.\nSince the Annual Business Meeting in January last, the Council\nhas been engaged in carrying out the resolution then adopted in\nfavour of the incorporation of the Society. The Rules, as then\npassed, have been put into the form of \" Articles of Association,\" to\nwhich a \" Memorandum of Association,\" defining the objects of the\nSociety, has been prefixed in the required form. In the course of the\ncommunications which passed with the Board of Trade, it was found\nthat it would simplify and facilitate the proceedings if the word \" In\ncorporated \" was added to the title of the Society, so that it would\nhenceforth be called \" The Incorporated Society for Psychical\nResearch.\" The Council has passed a resolution agreeing to this.\nThe approval of the Board of Trade of the Memorandum and Articles\nof Association has now been obtained, and at this meeting the\n\fJULY, 1895.] General Meeting. 115\nnecessary signatures were appended to these documents. The\nregistration is now merely a matter of detail, and the whole business\nwill shortly be completed. At the Annual Meeting, thanks were\naccorded to Mr. H. Arthur Smith and Mr. Sydney C. Scott for the\nwork they had done up to that time. The indebtedness of the Society\nto Messrs. Smith and Scott is greatly increased by the efficient\nmanner in which the Incorporation has been carried out, and by their\nkindness in saving much expense which would otherwise have been\nunavoidable.\nAfter a full discussion, the following resolution, proposed by\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, was unanimously agreed to :\u2014That it is\nextremely desirable, as a general rule, that no paper be published in\nthe Proceedings of the Society except attested by and under the name\nof the author or authors of that paper.\nVarious other matters of business having been discussed, it was\nagreed that the next meeting of the Council be on Friday, October 4th,\nat 4. 30 p.m., at 19, Buckingham-street, W.C.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 74th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall, on Friday, July 5th, at 4 p.m.; Professor Sidgwick\nin the chair.\nPROFESSOR W. F. BARRETT read a paper on \" Human Personality,\nin the light of, and in its relation to, Psychical Research.\"\nThe object of the paper was to discuss the bearing of recent psycho\nlogical and psychical research on the principal attributes of personality\n\u2014viz. : self-consciousness, self-identification, self-communication, self-\ncontrol, and self-determination, or what appears to be such.\nThe growth of the idea of personality\u2014\" of all that is actually or\npotentially contained within himself \"\u2014was shown to be as gradual\nin the race as it is in the child. We are discovering that there are\n\" abysmal deeps of personality which startle us at times by the vastness\nof the vistas they half disclose,\" and the author maintained that the\nretention of self-consciousness\u2014the chief attribute of personality\u2014\nin any condition of existence necessarily involved an ever widening,\nin fact a limitless, scope to our personality. There must ever be before\nus something to which we desire to attain if personality is to continue;\nfor an effortless existence, to which all education tends, ceases to be a\nself-conscious one. Many, probably all, the reflex actions of the human\norganism afford illustrations of this transition from a conscious\nto an unconscious state. They are all outside of our voluntary control\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1895.\nand belong to the region of the subliminal life. Psychical phenomena\nbelong in an especial degree to this region, and are therefore not\naided but injured by any interference of our will, just as a person\ncannot sneeze, or laugh, or cry by forcibly attempting to do so.\nThe paper then dealt incidentally with the effect of emotion\nin producing changes in the organism by reflex action : the effects pro\nduced on the skin and the secretions being most marked. This class\nof psycho-physical phenomena was shown to extend even to the lower\nforms of animal life ; the colour changes in the chameleon, the chame\nleon shrimp, and probably the very different colour changes in the skin\nof larvse and pupce of certain butterflies being traced to a powerful\nexternal suggestion, creating an emotional excitement which sets up\nthe change. The author suggested that possibly some of the curious\ncolour changes in the protective mimicry that occurs in the animal\nmight be due to a similar process. In stigmata, we have, in fact, the\neffects of suggestion creating a mimicry of the wounds seen in the\nobject of adoration intently gazed at by the ecstatic. How far this\neffect of suggestion on the subliminal life extends in the animal world,\nit would be interesting to know.\nMR. F. W. H. MYERS then read a paper on \" Resolute Credulity,\"\nwhich will appear in the forthcoming part of the Proceedings.\nThe lateness of the hour unfortunately precluded any full discus\nsion of this paper, but it was evident that a section of the audience\nregarded Mr. Myers' strictures as too sweeping. The Rev. J. Page Hopps\nprotested against Mr. Myers' view that there was no evidence for the\nemployment of occult power in any public entertainments, and other\ngentlemen spoke to having witnessed with Mr. Husk phenomena which\nthey regarded as genuine.\nQUEEN MARY'S DIAMONDS.\nBY ANDREW LANG.\nIn anecdotes about \" Retrocognition \" the evidence is obviously\nbad, as a rule. If the scene of the past beheld by the visionary is\nunknown, it cannot be verified. But if it is anywhere recorded in an\naccessible document (say in county histories) then we can never\ndemonstrate that the document is not the original source of the\nvisionary's information. He, or she, may swear that the document was\nunknown to him or her, but nobody can be expected to believe the\nstatement.\nWhat we need is an account of a vision of the past corroborated,\nafter publication, by a document not known to exist at the time of the\n\fJULY, 1895.] Queen Mary's Diamonds. 117\noccurrence of the vision, or of its publication. Nothing short of this\ncan make any impression on common sense, and even this would\nprobably fail. A case which comes measurably near to fulfilling the\nrequired conditions is that of Queen Mary's Diamonds. How near it\ncomes, I leave to the members of the S.P.R. to decide. Had it been\njust a trifle better, it would have sufficed for my conversion.\nDr. Gregory's Letters on Animal Magnetism were published in 1851.\nThe curious may consult Case 34 (p. 415), \"transcribed from Major\nBuckley's note-book.\" That document would be valuable here if it\ncould be procured. On November 15, 1845, Major Buckley mesmerised\na young officer. The officer averred that the cameo, or \"medallion\" of\nAntony and Cleopatra, in the Major's ring, had (as he \" saw \") been\ngiven to Mary Stuart, by a man, a musician, from Italy. \" I see his\nsignature. It begins with an R, an I, a letter which looks like Z,\nthen another Z, then an I, then there is something which looks like an\nE, with a curious flourish. I can write it.\" He wrote till he had\nfinished (had copied from a viewless manuscript on vellum, he said)\nthe words :\u2014\nRizzio.\nA,\nM\nI\nDE LA PART\nNext he \" copied \"\nVOUS AMEZ\u2014VOUS ETES BONNE.\nHe announced that, on the vellum, he saw \" a diamond cross ; \" the\nsmallest stone was larger than one of four carats, which he, or the\nMajor, possessed.\n\" It was worn, out of sight, by Mary. The vellum has been shewn\nin the House of Lords.\" The diamonds were now hidden in the wall of\na ruined house.\nHe next said that a man had taken the Major's ring (the setting,\nas the Major had it, was modern) off Mary's finger, on the first\noccasion of her wearing it, \" and threw it into the water.\" \" She was\nbeing carried in a kind of bed with curtains.\" Then he \" saw \" the\nscene of Rizzib's murder, not quite correctly, I think, but the statement\nis condensed, and it need not be understood as meaning that Rizzio\nwas slain in Mary's presence (p. 417).\nThree weeks later, being again mesmerised, he remembered the\nring, and re-copied the words VOUS AMEZ\u2014VOUS ETES BONNE.\nHe now wrote them thus :\u2014\nVOUS AMEZ PAR ... VOUS ETES BONNE.\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JCLY, 1895.\n\" Between PAR and VOUS some letters are covered with some\nthing green and wet.\" On the \" cross \" he saw \" an M., an S., then a\nsmall word, then a large R.\" He decorated the right corners of his\nsheet of paper with two leaves of the Thistle, the left, with flowers of\nthe Thistle. In the viewless original they \" are in gold.\"\nDr. Gregory prints (p. 418) \"a rough copy,\" by Major Buckley, of\nthe drawing made by the young officer. The cross is not represented.\nIf we only had the Major's note-book ! *\nSo much for the visions (November-December, 1845, published\n1851).\nDr. Gregory and the Major seem to have made no search in Mary's\nInventories for presents from Rizzio to her, or for the diamond cross.\nIf they had looked into Mr. Thomson's collection of the Inventories,\nthen in print, they would have found nothing.\nI myself consulted Dr. Joseph Robertson's edition of the\nInventories, of 1863 (Bannatyne Club). Here (p. xxxi., note 2), I\nfound mention of an Inventory and Will, made in June, 1566, before\nthe birth of James VI. (June 19th, 1566). This Inventory -wasfound\nat the Register House \" in August, 1854, among some unassorted law\npapers.\" Major Buckley, Dr. Gregory, and the young officer could not\nhave been aware in 1845, or in 1851, that any such document existed.\nIt was wholly unknown to everybody. Herein I found (p. Iv. and\nnote 1, cf. p. 123) that the Queen had received from Rizzio\u2014\n\"Une enseigne garnye de dix rubis en tortue, avec une perle\npendante au bout.\"\nDr. Robertson remarks (p. Iv., note 1), \"I have not observed any\nother trace of this gift. Rizzio had grown rich during his short tenure\nof power.\" \" In schort tym he becam very rich,\" says Sir James\nMelville.\nNow the Major may have known (from Melville's Memoirs) that\nRizzio became very rich, but that he gave Mary jewels Dr. Robertson\nhimself did not know before 1854, The rubies Mary bequeathed to\nRizzio's brother, Joseph, her private secretary, a lad of eighteen. She\nalso willed that an emerald ring, enamelled in white, and \" une bacgue\ngarnye de xxi diamens tant grands que petis \" (p. 122), shall be given\nto Joseph Rizzio, \" pour bailler a qui je lui ay dit dont il ranvoir\n(sic) aquitance.\" Here, then, as Dr. Robertson observes, is \"a mystery\ninto which it would be idle now to seek to pry.\" (p. Ivi.)\n* Mr. Lang writes to us :\u2014\"January 28th, 1895. To-day, at the Castle, in the\nroom where James VI. was born, June 19th, 1566, I observed, in the square laquearies\nof the (1617) roof, the same device, with a thistle flower at each corner, and I hear the\ndevice recurs in a document of Queen Mary's. Is this coincidence, or design? Had the\nofficer got up his facts, so far, at the Castle ? Was Hucklsy in Edinburgh in 1845 ? \"\n\fJULY, 1895.] Queen Mary's Diamonds. 119\nThere I leave it to the reader. A \" bague,\" of course, is any jewel\nin old French. Are the \" xxi diamonds small and large \" of the\nQueen's secret bequest, the same diamonds (also of various sizes), which\n\" Mary wears out of sight,\" in the officer's vision, and which he\nconnects with Rizzio? I do not find the jewel in any Inventory of\nMary's before that of 1566.\nNota bene.\u2014Rizzio spelled his name Riccio, but I have seen no\nsignature of his.\nIt is said to me that any young officer in Edinburgh (but nothing\nis said of his being in Edinburgh) might dream about Queen Mary.\nBut would he know that she was carried in a litter 1 The litter is in\nthe Inventory, \"a bed with curtains,\" as the officer said, and the\ncurtains were \" of velvet cramoisie.\" Mary usually rode, but at the\ntime of Rizzio's death, she was within four months of her confinement.\nWhy was \" the vellum shewn in the House of Lords \" ? We only\nknow that Mary's papers were shown in the Scots Parliament and\nbefore Elizabeth's Commission, at Westminster. The Major and the\nofficer might easily know that fact. The letters M.R.S. may stand for\nMaria Begina Scotorum.\nThe whole comes to this,\u2014the vision of 1845 shewed presents from\nRizzio to the Queen (then unknown to history) and diamonds with a\nsecret of their own, \" worn out of sight.\" History knew no such\ndiamonds.\nThe discovered document, nine years later, revealed a valuable\npresent from Rizzio to Mary, and the existence of diamonds with\na secret, a secret that could be shared with a boy of eighteen,\nwho was Rizzio's brother. In the vision \" a letter which looks like a\nZ \" is set down as a Z ; it should have been a C. That may be fatal,\nunless Rizzio's C's were capable of being construed into Z's by a person\nwho, in his normal state of consciousness, probably wrote Z's in Rizzio.\nWe neerl Major Buckley's note-book, and we need an example of\nRizzio's signature.\nA diamond \" cross \" or a diamond \" bague \" are, I think, terms\nfairly interchangeable.\nFor whom did Mary really intend her bague of twenty-one\ndiamonds ? Bothwell and the Guises and other unpopular friends\nreceive publicly announced bequests of value. As the donor of the\nvisionary diamonds, Dr. Gregory suggests the Pope, sending them\nthrough Rizzio. We know that some time in 1566 (letter undated),\nMary expected a gift of money from Pius V., the money to be brought\nby the Bishop of Dunblain, but the lack of date makes conjecture\nundesirable (Labanoff. Vol. VII., p. 356).\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

She answered,\n\" Don't let them get hold of you, it is a bad habit.\" I replied, \" This is no\nordinary presentiment ; all day long I have felt that something terrible is\nimpending,\u2014of what nature I do not know ; I have fought against it, but to\nno purpose ; it is a terror I am positively possessed with.\" I was proceeding\nto describe it in fuller detail, when my mother entered the room with a tele\ngram in her hand. One glance at her face told me that my foreboding had\nnot been a groundless depression. The telegram was to the effect that my\nbrother had been taken ill at Cambridge, and needed my mother at once to\nnurse him.\nI presume that the intensity of my foreboding was due to the very serious\nnature of his illness.\nI experience at different times what are in common parlance termed\n\" presentiments \" ; but only on one other occasion has the same peculiar\n\" terror \" (a chilling conviction of impending trouble) beset me.\nD.W.\nThe following is the maid's testimony :\u2014\nMay 19th, 1895.\nA remarkable circumstance occurred on the 17th of January.

E. S.\nL. 991. Ad P\" Apparition.\nThis case came to us through Mr. A. Aksakoff, who received it\nfrom Mrs. Broussiloff. She writes :\u2014\nSt. Petersburg, April 19th, 1895.\nOn the 16th (28th) of February of this year (1895) between 9 and 10\no'clock in the evening, I, the undersigned,was sitting in our drawing-room\u2014\nthe small one\u2014facing the large drawing-room which I could see in its entire\nlength. My husband, his brother with his wife, and my mother were also\nsitting in the same room with me round a large round table. I was writing\ndown my household accounts for the day, whilst the others were carrying on\nsome gay conversation. Having accidentally raised my head and looked into\nthe large drawing-room, I noticed, with astonishment, that a large gray\nshadow had passed from the door of the dining-room to that of the ante\nchamber ; and it came into my head that the figure I had seen bore a strik\ning resemblance in stature to Colonel Av*-Meinander, an acquaintance of\nours, who had lived in this very lodging for a long time. At the first\nmoment I wished to say at once that a ghost had just flashed before me, but\nstopped, as I was afraid of being laughed at by my husband's brother and his\nwife, and also of being scolded by my husband, who, in view of the excite\nment which I showed when such phenomena were taking place, tried to con\nvince me that they were the fruit of my fancy. As I knew that Meinander\nwas alive and well, and was commander of the \" Malorossusky \" 40th regi\nment of dragoons, I did not say anything then ; but when I was going to\nbed, I related to my mother what I had seen, and the next morning could not\nrefrain from mentioning it to my husband.\nOur astonishment was extreme when on the 18th of February (2nd of\nMarch) we learned that Nicholas Ottovitch Av-Meinander had actually died\nafter a short illness on the 16th (28th) of February at 9 o'clock in the\nevening, in the town of Stashovo.t where his regiment is stationed.\nANNA NICOLAIEVNA BROUSSILOFF.\nMrs. Broussiloff's mother writes :\u2014\nMy daughter did actually relate to me on February 16th (28th), about\nmidnight, when I was going to bed, about the phantom she had seen,\nprecisely as she has described it above.\nMARIE VON HAGBMEISTBR^\nColonel Broussiloff writes :\u2014\nArakkcheieff Barracks, St. Petersburg, April 19th, 1895.\nColonel Nicholas Ottovitch Av-Meinander and his family had formerly\n* Particle equivalent to the German \" von\" (the name is a Swedish one).\nt Government of Radom, Poland, 1,200 vents from Petersburg.\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Both\nhe and the members of his household liked this lodging very much, and\nparted with it with regret about four years ago, in consequence of his\nappointment as commander of the \" Malorosstisky \" 40th regiment of\ndragoons, stationed in the town of Stashovo.\nFrom time to time my wife had already seen ghosts before, which threw\nher into a great state of excitement. I consequently did my utmost to per\nsuade her not to pay any attention to such phenomena and to consider them\nthem as the fruit of imagination. My wife had never seen anything super\nnatural for the last two years, and was inexpressibly glad of it. She is a\nwoman of a quiet and equable character, and is not nervous generally. On\nthe 16th (28th) of February, no one of us had any reason to be excited or\nto think about Meinander, as, according to information that was to hand,\nboth he and his family were in excellent health. When my wife related to\nme her vision in the morning of February 17th, I laughed at her and\nrequested her not to think about this case, whichI considered to be a halluci\nnation. The first news of Meinander's unexpected demise was received by\nus on February 18th, when we read in the [military] \" order of the day\"\n[appended to the original narrative in Russian] that Meinander was dead and\nthat a funeral service for the rest of his soul was to be celebrated ; and the\nnext morning we read in the [obituary notices of the] Novoie Vremia, No.\n6,816, that he had died on February 16th (28th), at nine o'clock in the\nevening.\nCOLONEL ALEXIS-ALEX^IEVITCH BROUSSILOFP.\nP. 178. Dream.\nThe next case, which originally appeared in the newspapers in\nconnection with the report of an inquest at Birmingham, was\ninvestigated by Mr. Martyn Smith, of Abberton Hall, Pershore, a\nMember of the S.P.R. He writes :\u2014\nApril 26th, 1895.\nI was in court and heard all the evidence, which was on oath, and to my\nmind seems to point directly to a case of thought-transference.\nThe following is the newspaper account of the inquest, sent by Mr.\nMartyn Smith :\u2014\nAnother inquest had reference to the death of Rose Foster (13), 32 Court,\n14 house, Camden-street, whose body was found in the canal at Spring Hill,\non the 19th inst. [i.e. April 19th.] The mother stated that her daughter was\nvery nervous and frightened, especially at thunder and lightning. A little\nwhile ago she was told that she was suffering from an affection of the kidneys,\nwhich would put her life in danger unless she was very careful. She had\nbeen living with her aunt, but on Good Friday she came home of her own\nfree will. On Wednesday she left the house suddenly, and was not seen\nalive by witness again. Several witnesses were called, who spoke to seeing\ndeceased sheltering from the thunderstorm under the bridge, and Thomas\nTarpler said he was in a boat on the canal near the bridge when the storm\n\fJULY, 1895.] Cases Received by the Literary Committee. 123\nwas at its height, and he heard a scream and a splash, but he did not see\nany one. Elizabeth Turton stated that on Wednesday she was going with\nthe deceased over Spring Hill Bridge, when witness remarked to her, \" Oh,\nthat water !\" Witness said this because about twelve months ago she fell\ninto the water there. Deceased said, \" I feel as if I could jump over there \"\n(meaning the bridge). Witness upon this said to deceased, \"Oh, you soon\nwant to part with your life. I have not seen enough enjoyment yet. \"\nFoster answered, \" You don't know what trouble I have had to go through.\"\nMrs. Jeffrey, of the George Inn, Grove-lane, Smethwick, aunt of the\ndeceased, said the girl had lived with her for some weeks. She was sulky,\nand witness told her she would have to go back home if she did not behave\nherself. Thereupon the girl left of her own accord. On Tuesday* the\ngir1's brother came to tell her she was missing. That night witness dreamt '\u2022\nthat she was walking along the towing-path of the canal to her sister's\nhouse, and that while stirring the water with her umbrella she saw the\nface of her niece. Next morning she went to the scene, and found the\npolice dragging underneath the bridge. She asked them to drag at the\nspot where in her dream she saw the face. They did so, and at once found\nthe body. It was some distance from the bridge.\nMr. Martyn Smith sends us the following notes of his interviews\nwith Mrs. Jefferies, and with the Police Inspector who superintended\nthe dragging of the canal :\u2014\nMay Uth, 1895.\nMrs. Jefferies, of the George Inn, Grove Lane, Smethwick, says it was\nthe Wednesday after Good Friday that her niece (Foster) was missing. On\nthe following day her (Mrs. Jefferies') nephew, brother of the niece, called\non his aunt, saying that he did not think she was alive, as some girls had\ntold him his sister had said she would not speak to them again\u2014meaning she\nwould not see them\u2014and he suspected she was drowned. The aunt said,.\n\" Oh, I should not take any notice of that, she'll turn up,\" or something to\nthat effect. Mrs. J., however, continued to think about it (as her niece used\nto live with her), and the same night, Thursday, had a dream. She thought\nshe was walking along the side of the canal at Spring Hill with an umbrella,\nwhich she let touch to ripple the water ; when at a certain spot she saw the\nface of her niece appear above the surface twice, and the second time she\ncaught it by the hair, lifted her out and clasped her to her breast and kissed\nher. She woke up after the dream much terrified. She told it to her\nservant and may have told it to others.\nThe next morning (Friday) she heard that the police were dragging\nthe canal and went\u2014she had not been near the spot for 5 or 6 years before\n\u2014and spoke to the sergeant, told him of her dream, and asked if he would\ntry the drag at the place she had seen the face in her dream. They did so..\nThe face of the girl appeared above the water just as she had seen it (in\nsleep) ; it sank again, and the second time the face appeared in the same\nposition, and the brother leaped into the water and clasped the body to his\nbreast and kissed the face as the aunt had dreamt she herself had done.\n* Obviously a misprint for \" Thursday.\"\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1895.\nMrs. Jefferies says that previous to anything unusual happening to her\n\u2022or her connexions she has some \" warning \" by dreams. She is sister to the\nmother of the drowned girl. She did not know before her dream that the\ncanal would be dragged, nor had she received any intimation about it.\nBirmingham, May 7th, 1895.\nActing-Inspector Whittingham was told off in charge of two minor officers\nto drag the canal near to the spot where the girl had been last seen. While\nthere he was accosted by the aunt, who stood by the canal side and appeared\nto take great interest in what was going on, and she asked him whether she\nmight tell him a dream that she had had the previous night. Thereupon she\nexplained that in her dream she had a clear view of the dying girl, but some\ndistance from the spot where they were then dragging\u2014about 55 to 60 yards.\nThe inspector suggested that the men should go to the other spot, and recom\nmenced the dragging, and they came across the body at the point indicated,\nthe fourth or fifth time of putting in the drag.\nMARTYN SMITH.\nM.C1. 93. Crystal vision.\nThis case was sent to us by Mr. Andrew Lang. He is well\nacquainted with all the witnesses, whose names were given us in\nconfidence.\nThe following is the account of the seer :\u2014\nSt. Andrews, Febrimry Wth, 1895.\nOn Sunday, January 20th, 1895, at about 5.30 p.m., I was crystal gazing\nand saw Miss M. L. in her drawing-room in , sitting on a sofa, pouring\nout tea for a man in a blue serge suit, whose back was towards me. I noticed\nhe had a brown moustache. Miss L. was dressed in a dark-coloured blouse\nwith a lace covering over the shoulders. There was a lamp at Miss L.'s left\nhand. I described what I had seen to her, and she said what I had seen was\nquite correct. R. T. B.\nMiss M. L. writes :\u2014\nMr. B., without explaining why, asked me at a ball if I had been giving\ntea to a man on the previous Sunday afternoon. Such a thing is possible\nany Sunday ; but he then proceeded to describe my dress and also exactly\nwhere I was sitting, so much so, that I at once said that one of the blinds\nmust have been up and that he had seen me from the other side of the road,\nwhich, however, proves impossible, as Mr. B. was in St. Andrews at the\ntime.\nHe also described where the other man was sitting, with his back to the\nwindow, and I was on the sofa giving out tea, all of which I answered\nunwittingly in the affirmative. This is all I can remember. M. L.\nMr. B.'s sister writes to Mr. Lang :\u2014\nFebruary 12th, 1895.\nI enclose the separate accounts. T. wrote his in St. Andrews on Sunday,\nand Miss L.'s was written yesterday in answer to my letter and without her\nhaving seen T. again.

Dream.\nProm Mrs. Clarkson, of Alverthorpe Hall, Wakefield.\nThis case also was recorded, with complete corroboration, within a\nfew days after it happened. It will be observed, however, that there\nwas no exact coincidence of time, and the information conveyed by the\ndream was only partially correct.\nMiss C. Clarkson writes :\u2014\nAlverthorpe Hall, Wakefield, May 8th, 1894.\nOn Sunday May 5th, 1894,* my sister and I were boating on the river\nDerwent, in Yorkshire (near Kirkham Abbey) with a party of friends in a\nsmall steam launch. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, we\nhad all landed to gather cowslips in the fields, and on returning to the boat,\nfor some reason the usual plank for landing was not in position, and we\njumped in turn from the bank on to the flat end of the boat. I was the last,\nand in jumping missed my footing and slipped into the water, catching\nthe edge of the boat hiwever with my hands as I went, and supporting my\nself\u2014so that I was not totally immersed, though the water was a good depth\nwhere we were. Two of the gentlemen rushed forward and pulled me out by\nmy arms. I said as I was being hauled up, \" It is no use pulling so hard,\nyou hurt me.\" One of them said \" We must pull, if we are to get you out.\"\nI was got on to the boat in a very short time, and was never in any danger.\nWe returned to our own home the next day, and never mentioned in the\nslightest way the little accident to any one, lest my father, who is a very\nold man, should be alarmed or worried at what had happened. Shortly after\nwe returned, my step-mother said to my sister, \" Have you had an accident\non the river?\" \"I? No,\" said my sister. \"Because,\" continued my\nstep-mother, \"I had a very distressing dream about you last night\u2014I\ndreamt you fell into the river, and I was in the boat and got hold of your\nhair, and tried to pull you out. You said, ' Don't pull so hard, you hurt me.'\nI said ' You had better be hurt than drowned.' \"\nThen, and not till then, did we tell her that one of us really had had an\naccident precisely as she had dreamed, but that her dream had made a mis\ntake in the identity of the sisters.\nAccording to my step-mother's account, my father also seemed to have\nbeen a little anxious and uneasy in his sleep that night, and in the morning\nrather pointedly asked her if she had dreamt anything, but said nothing\nfurther ; and nothing was afterwards said to him to make him aware of what\nhad happened. My step-mother's dream was during the night after the\naccident occurred.

Lor is A CLARKSON.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[T\/ie Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nA NOTE ON \"MESMERIC PASSES.\"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nSIR, \u2014I should like to have the opinion of hypnotists on the value and\nmode of operation (if any) of the so-called \" mesmeric passes.\" Have they\nany utility per se ?\nI think most of us will admit that they often form a very potent and con\nvenient mode of using suggestion. Since I began to study hypnotism,\nI have tried to decide for myself the question, whether (1) any force is really\ntransmitted from the hypnotist to his subject ; or (2) that the supposed\neffect of the passes is due only to suggestion. Hitherto, I have not seen\nsufficient evidence to point definitely to either conclusion. But may not\nboth conclusions be partially true ? I think it is easily demonstrable that\nsuggestion plays a great part here. For the hypnotic with his exalted senses\nis often aware that passes\u2014even those without contact\u2014are being made, and\nverbal suggestion often tells him their import. But I am inclined to think\nthat there is something beyond this, not to be accounted for by suggestion.\n[The writer then suggests that possibly the unknown force concerned in\npasses is some manifestation of electricity or magnetism in a modified or\nallotropic form, and proceeds :\u2014]\nI will now mention a few facts that have occurred under my personal\n\u2022observation, which appear to me to support this hypothesis. But first, I\n\fJULY, 1895.] Correspondence. 127\nshould like to say that I am not aware that a galvanometer has ever shown\nany electrical current passing from operator to subject, when neither body\nis insulated.\n1. I have, though rarely, experienced great physical exhaustion following\nthe use of passes in a hypnotic se'ance.\n2. Hypnotics are often aware of the direction or position of passes with\nout contact, or know when they are or are nut being made. This may be due\nsometimes to telepathy, or to the hypersesthesia of their sense of touch,\nhearing, [or] temperature, [or to their] feeling the current of air caused by\nthe hypnotist's hands.\n3. A patient lying on her side in bed with face turned away from me,\nand clothed with one fold of garment, was able repeatedly to tell me what\npart of her spine my fingers were pointing at, though they were not touch\ning it, but were within an inch or two.\n4. A deaf man with eyes blindfolded, sitting dressed opposite to me,\ncould tell much more often than not when I made slow passes without con\ntact over his thighs.\nIn these last two cases, I maintain that the subjects could not tell position\nof my hands from feeling warmth from them.\n5. A very sensitive hysterical woman winced repeatedly when I made\npasses slowly from above downwards, several inches away from her body,\nand could only bear them when made at a distance of several feet.\n6. The same subject turned her head away repeatedly when I placed,\nunknown to her, a compound bar magnet pointing to her occiput at a distance\nof from three to six inches.\n7. In several subjects, after making passes over the head and chest, the\nrespiration became laboured, or symptoms of hysteria arose. Long passes,\nwithout contact, from head to foot calmed them, and respiration became\nnormal ; this looks as though the long passes relieved a congestion by\nequalising the influence all over the body. The same calming effect was\nnoticed if I made dispersive passes rapidly across the head and chest.\n8. A subject sat asleep, excited and moaning. I placed my wrists\nlightly against her temples with my fingers pointing upwards. The result\nwas that the patient became rapidly calm and comfortable. A few times\nwhile doing this, I seemed to feel a warm aura running off at my finger tips,\nwhile my hands, previously slightly moist, became hot and dry in a few\nseconds. Many times when doing this, I have noticed no aura when the\npatient was quiet, although I was looking out for it.\n9. Several times, a silently exerted will, together with passes, have pro\nduced phenomena desired, such as willing one arm to remain stiff after\nawaking. This might be due to telepathy.\n10. Many other times I have noticed other things, not coming under the\nabove heads, which point to the same conclusion \u2014viz. : that there is an in\nfluence passing from operator to subject, not wholly accounted for by the\ntheory of suggestion.\nC.

It would be\nremembered that at a meeting held in October of last year, an\naccount was given by Professor Lodge of some experiments with\nan Italian \" medium,\" Eusapia Paladino, in which physical pheno\nmena professedly supernormal were produced. He had on that\noccasion thought it right to give some support from his own\nexperience\u2014though only a limited and qualified support\u2014to the claims\nof this medium. He had, in fact, been impressed by her performances ;\nbut had thought that further experiments were necessary before coming\nto a final conclusion. Accordingly, in conjunction with Mr. Myers and\nothers, he had made another series of experiments with the same\nmedium in England, in August and September of the present year :\nand, after comparing his own experiences with those of other members\nof the group of investigators, he considered it to be proved beyond a\ndoubt that the medium had used systematic trickery throughout this\nseries of sittings. Her modus operandi he would leave it to Dr. Hodgson\nto describe, who\u2014though only present during a part of the sittings\u2014\nhad had better opportunities for personally observing the actual process\nof fraud. When this trickery had been discovered, the greater part\nof the phenomena offered as supernormal at these sittings were at once\nexplained : and, this being so, he thought it, in the circumstances,\nunreasonable to attribute\u2014even hypothetically\u2014to supernormal\nagency the residuum that was not so easily explicable. And, consider\ning the great general resemblance between the performances of the\nmedium at these sittings and those which he had witnessed last year,\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OcT., 1895.\nhe was now disposed to think that his earlier experiences were to be\nsimilarly explained : he therefore wished to withdraw altogether the\nlimited and guarded support which he had given last year to the\nsupernormal pretensions of Eusapia Paladino.\nDr. HODGSON said that most of the members were probably aware\nthat while in America, and before he had seen Eusapia, he had\ncriticised the reports of her performances, and had come to the con\nclusion that the evidence offered was not sufficient to establish the\noccurrence of any supernormal phenomenon in connection with her\nseances. They would therefore not be surprised that he felt\nstrengthened in this conclusion by the series of seances in Cambridge\nin which he shared, and in which he had the opportunity of observing-\nfor himself the surreptitious freeing of foot and hand which he had\nconjectured in his previous criticism to constitute the main part of\nEu?apia's trick-devices. He did not think it necessary to suppose the\nuse of any complicated apparatus at the seances where he was present ;\nprobably no more instruments were required than a handkerchief and\na small object, such as a coin or a piece of paper, covered with some\nphosphorescent preparation. He then illustrated the general principle of\nthe method used by Eusapia in getting one hand or foot free from control,\nand remarked upon her special cleverness in dealing with the hands of\nthe sitters, so as to prevent their suspecting that one of her hands was\ndoing duty for two. He had been enabled to perceive this process in\ndetail when Professor Sidgwick was holding Eusapia's other hand.\nApparently Eusapia had previously ascertained that Professor Sidgwick\ninsisted upon guarding securely the hand entrusted to him, and she\nimmediately set to work to get the other hand free. Dr. Hodgson\nillustrated the process by giving his left hand to Professor Sidgwick to\nhold, pointing out how Professor Sidgwick was rightly assured that it\nwas really the left hand, by the way in which he used the active grasp,\nso as to locate clearly the position of the thumb with reference to the\nrest of the hand ; and he then showed how the finger-tips of the left\nhand were substituted for the finger-tips of the right hand so as to\npreserve hand contact with the sitter on the other side, thus allowing\nthe right hand to become free. He then showed how Eusapia made\none foot do duty for two by getting the sitters on each side of her to\nplace their feet so that she could press upon one of their feet with the\nheel, and upon the other with the toe of the same foot. Concerning\nthe movement of articles supposed to be beyond her reach, he said that\nit was specially observed that articles that were beyond her ordinary\nreach at the beginning of the seance became, later on, well within her\nreach, owing to the fact that during the preliminary part of the se'ance\n\fOCT., 1895.] General Meeting. 133\nthe table at which she was seated was continually being moved about\nand gradually drawn nearer to the articles.\nMr. F. W. H. MYERS said : I feel it to be my duty to endorse\nwhat Professor Sidgwick has said as to the unsatisfactory character of\nthe seances held this summer in my house with Eusapia Paladino. I\n\u2022cannot doubt that we observed much conscious and deliberate fraud,\nof a kind which must have needed long practice to bring it to its\npresent level of skill. Nor can I find any excuse for her fraud (assuming\nthat such excuse could be valid) in the attitude of mind of the persons,\nseveral of them distinguished in the world of science, who assisted in\nthis inquiry. Their attitude was a fair and open one ; in all cases\nthey showed patience ; and in several cases the impression at first made\non their minds was distinctly favourable. With growing experience,\nhowever, and careful observation of the precise conditions permitted\nor refused to us, the existence of some fraud became clear : and fraud\n\u2022was attempted when the tests were as good as we were allowed to\nmake them, quite as indisputably as on the few occasions when our\nholding was intentionally left inadequate in order to trace more\nexactly the modus operandi. Moreover, the fraud occurred both in\nthe medium's waking state and during her real or alleged trance.\nI do not think that there is adequate reason to suppose that any\nof the phenomena at Cambridge were genuine.\nAs to the far more striking phenomena which I witnessed in 1894\nat the lIe Roubaud, some of these continue, in my judgment at least,\ninexplicable by the tricks observed at Cambridge. And it must bs noted\nthat Professor Richet, whose belief has always been contingent upon\ngood holding, had already observed all or most of these tricks, and had\npointed them out in his Report on the Milan experiments. I do not,\nhowever, myself now wish to press any incidents in Eusapia's past\ncareer as evidentially cogent.\nMore than this it would not at present be fitting for me to say.\nThe confidence in some of Eusapia's phenomena felt by several of the\nmain continental investigators has not been destroyed ; and a French\ngroup, to whom Eusapia passed after leaving my house, and to whom I\nforwarded full information as to our recent experiences, tell me that\nthey have, since receiving that information, obtained phenomena\nwhich they still regard as genuine. So long as further experiments\nare being made by persons of recognised scientific position, fair-minded\npersons will prefer to judge of such phenomena as these investigators\nmay obtain from the reports which they themselves may make on them.\nMr. MYERS then read the following letter from PROFESSOR LODGE,\nwho was unable to be present :\u2014\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OcT., 1895.\nI have myself only had two sittings at Cambridge, both of them since the\ndiscovery of fraud. The first of them seemed to me to contain some-\ngenuine features, the second was fraudulent throughout. I took pains to\nexamine and verify this latter fact, and am entirely convinced of it, though\nI express no opinion as to whether the acts are due to Eusapia in her norma1\nstate, or whether they may charitably be considered as of a semi-unconscious\ncharacter. Whatever may be the psychological conditions, the physical fact\nis that at that sitting she gave one of her hands to two persons to hold (or be\nin contact with different parts of), while her other hand was free.\nIt remains for me to consider how far this undoubted fact influences my\nprevious Report (Journal S.P.R., November, 1894). In the eyes of the public,\nif the public ever read it, any incipient credit which they were disposed to give\nit must be destroyed ; but to any more cautious and scrupulous seeker after\ntruth I would say that the main facts related in that document remain in my\nmind almost undisturbed. I would even go so far as to say that some of the\nphenomena related to have occurred at Cambridge do not seem to me\nscientifically explicable on any such simple hypothesis as that of a free hand\nwithout mechanism. I admit, however, that considering the extreme\ndifficulty of all occult hypotheses, it behoves one to stretch to the uttermost\nany conceivably normal explanation, and for that reason I feel it safest to\nabandon, without further analysis, many phenomena of which nevertheless\nI do not perceive any rational explanation. In this category it is probably\nbest to place everything which occurred while a second sitter held Eusapia's\nother hand, i.e., anything which depends on the conviction of two separate\nindividuals that they each are holding a different hand of the medium :\nthough, indeed, remembering that on the island Eusapia frequently sat\nat the broad side of the table, so that her two hands could hardly be\nbrought close together for the purpose of effecting the interchange without\nattention being called to it, I feel that one may be jettying a great deal of\nsound cargo by such an abandonment.\nBut when I think of the incident of the door-key, with the amount of\nlight coming in from the window, and the long-continued sound, so that\nDr. Ochorowicz outside in the verandah asked who was doing it, and on being\ntold \"John,\" inquired several times \"aeecguoif\" we all the time being intent\non the clear space between Eusapia and the door ; when I further remember\nthe arrival of the key on the table, its return to the door and re-arrival, I\nfind it absurdly impossible to suppose that she had an arm or a leg stretched\nout to the door handle all that time without our being aware of it. Again,\nwhen I think of the winding up of the chalet hanging from the ceiling, while\nEusapia was leaning over on to me at a distance from it far beyond her\nnormal reach ; when I remember the chair moving in the moonlight, and the\nbulging curtain, bulging not as if pulled by a string but as if a substantial\nsolid body were inside it ; and again, the escritoire pushed back from a\ndistance increasing by definite stages ; I fail to see any resemblance\nbetween the wretched fraudulent sitting at Cambridge and the occur\nrences on the island.\nThen again, the trance personality of the medium, yclept John,\u2014there\nwas hardly a sign of that at Cambridge\u2014nor of his anxiety to give good and\n\fOCT., 1S95.] General Meeting. 135\nthorough conditions without preliminary distraction, nor of his readiness to\nrepeat phenomena whenever a doubt was expressed. Over and over again,\non the island, have I had hand-grasps while I myself was securely holding\nboth hands of the medium. Nor was the foot-holding (when referred to by\nme as beyond doubt) a simple placing of foot upon foot\u2014which I admit\nis perfectly insecure\u2014but it was often a kind of holding that rendered it\ncertain that neither foot was free, even if the result were such as to be\ncapable of achievement by a free foot.\nMy belief, therefore, in the intrinsic character of the island phenomena\nremains unshaken by the present exposure ; and, after fully considering the\nobvious criticisms that may be made on my position, I nevertheless think\ngenuine the good sittings which I had first, and I think fraudulent the bad\nsitting which I had last, (when I was presumably and certainly a better\ntrained witness). The order in which the events have occurred in my case\nis awkward ; but it is legitimate to point out that the present observation of\nattempted deception on the part of Eusapia is not exactly a new discovery :\nthe possibility of just this kind of deception had been carefully pointed out\nby Professor Richet, and the appearance of fraud at bad sittings had been\nalso reported by Dr. Ochorowicz,*\u2014not to speak of the more hostile witness,\nSignor Torelli. I am therefore in hopes that the present decadent state of\nthe Neapolitan woman may be only temporary, and that hereafter some\ncompetent and thoroughly prepared witness may yet bear testimony to the\ncontinued existence of a genuine abnormal power existent in her organism.\nThe CHAIRMAN said that the meeting would perceive that while\nthere was no material difference of view among the investigators as to\nthe results of the Cambridge experiments, there was not complete agree\nment as to the inferences to be drawn from them. But they all, he\nbelieved, agreed with him in holding that their records of experiments\n\u2022with Eusapia Paladino should not be regarded as part of the evidence\npresented by the Society, for the consideration of impartial persons, in\nfavour of the genuineness of phenomena of this class. Accordingly,\nthe records that had been printed in the Journal relating to this\nmedium would not be published in their Proceedings.\nDr. HODGSON then read a paper on \" Recent Phenomena of Trance\nobserved through Mrs. Piper.\" He began by giving a brief description\nof Mrs. Piper and her manner of passing into the trance state, making\nreference to the previous reports concerning her which appeared in the\nProceedings S.P.R., Parts XVII. and XXI. The following is a short\noutline only of what was said, as the detailed record of Mrs. Piper's\nrecent trance-phenomena will be published in Part XXX. of the\nProceedings. Her usual \" control \" is still the so-called Phinuit, whose\ncharacteristics were described in detail in the reports mentioned, where\n* See quotations in the March-April Journal S.P.R., pp. 40, 41, and 77 ; see also\nProceedings S.P.R., Vol. IX. pp. 228\u2014225.\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1895.\nreasons are given for rejecting the hypothesis of imposture on the\npart of Mrs. Piper. Since the publication of those reports a marked\nimprovement has taken place in the quality of the evidence, and some\nnew light has been thrown upon its significance.\nThis improvement appears to be due chiefly to three causes. One of\nthese was the sudden death, early in 1892, of a young man who may\nbe called George Robinson, who purported to make himself known\nabout four weeks later through Mrs. Piper's trance, and who has since\nthat time furnished much information for the purpose of establishing\nhis identity, and who has claimed, also, to be present very frequently\nfor the purpose of assisting other alleged communicators. Another\ncircumstance which has contributed towards the improvement manifest\nin Mrs. Piper's sittings is the development of automatic writing during\nher trance. Mrs. Piper's right hand is taken possession of, so to\nspeak, by some other \" control,\" purporting to be a deceased friend of\nthe sitter, while Phinuit still \" controls \" the voice. Finally, early in\n1893, Mrs. Piper underwent a surgical operation for the removal of a\ntraumatic tumour, thereby getting rid of a continual source of ill-\nhealth which had troubled her for some years, and which had inter\nfered much with her sittings.\nThe statements made in the automatic writing, which appears to\nbe produced independently of Phinuit, and which frequently goes on\nwithout a break while Phinuit continues talking, are usually more\nspecific and more characteristic of the deceased person from whom\nthey purport to come than the information given through Phinuit. But\nthis is not always the case. On two occasions both hands wrote\nindependently of each other, purporting to represent different deceased\npersons, while Phinuit was using the voice.\nInstances were given, under different names, of the kind of infor\nmation offered by the alleged George Robinson in proof of his\nidentity. The communications received included much private matter\nknown to only one or two persons, besides incidents concerning special\nfriends of George Robinson whose names were given in connection\nwith them, and who were not present at the sittings. Some of these\nincidents were unknown to the sitters, and were afterwards verified\nby persons who had not previously seen Mrs. Piper. Besides giving\nthis large mass of information which was known to George Robinson\nwhen living, the \" communicator \" exhibited in various cases a super\nnormal knowledge of private incidents which had occurred since \" his \"\ndeath to specific persons, which \" he \" claimed to have seen during\ntheir occurrence, and which were offered as further proof that \" he \"\nexisted independently of Mrs. Piper's organism. Owing partly to the\n\fOCT., 1895.] General Meeting. 137\nlong continuance of the communications from George Robinson, the\n\u2022evidence in his case is stronger and more abundant than that in con\nnection with any other communicator. George Robinson has himself\n\u2022explained that there are various difficulties in the process of communi\n\u2022cation, and attributes his success to a combination of several favouring\n\u2022conditions, such as his sudden death while in the fulness of his intel\nlectual vigour, the opportunity afforded him for communications shortly\nafter his death, and the continuance of that opportunity, the fact\nthat his strongest attachments are to persons still living, and his\nfamiliarity with mental operations and habit of introspection.\nInstances were given of supernormal knowledge shown in the case\nof other \" communicators,\" among them a Honolulu boy, who wrote\nseveral words of Hawaiian. Cases of premonition and telsesthesia were\nalso quoted, but experiments in these directions were in other cases\nfailures, and the evidence for these faculties was not regarded as\nmaterially increased.\nReferring briefly to the different primd facie suppositions that\nmight be applied in explanation, there are two that appear most\nplausible. One of these would explain all the phenomena by telepathy\nfrom the living ; the other would include also telepathy from the\ndead. This last hypothesis, the \" spiritistic,\" seems at the present\ntime to be the most satisfactory, and its adoption has been followed\nby the best results. There are, of course, instances of \" bad sittings,\"\nof confusions, irrelevancies, &c., and an effort has been made to\nobtain some light on these points. It is claimed by the communicators\nthat among the difficulties which prevent clear communication are the\nfollowing:\u2014(1) The ill-health of Mrs. Piper herself on various\noccasions. There is less of whatever peculiar kind of energy (spoken\nof as \" light \") is available for the act of communication, and the result\nis more or less dreamy in character. (2) Confusion still inherent in\nthe mind of the communicator, who is described as frequently remain\ning in a comatose state for some time after death. (3) Confusion pro\nduced by the very act of communicating, whicli is said to have a\ntendency to cause a loss of consciousness as by taking a drug. (4)\nCommunication is chiefly telepathic, and there is a tendency for every\nthought that passes through the communicator's mind to be expressed,\nand not only those which he wishes to express. It is hoped that further\nexperiment may throw additional light on these and similar points.\nDr. Hodgson concluded by urging upon the members the desir\nability of writing out \" messages,\" enclosing them in sealed envelopes\nwith directions, and sending them to Mr. Myers for preservation, so\nthat the writers may, if possible, after their death, communicate their\ncontents as proof of their identity.\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. OCT., I895i\nAfter the conclusion of Dr. Hodgson's paper,\nDr. WALLACE asked if the handwriting of alleged communicators\nhad been compared with the handwriting of the individual before\ndeath.\nDr. HODGSON said that he had not examined this point completely ;\nbut that there was certainly some evidence that the early writings\nresembled those of the persons represented ; only, as the communica\ntions went on, the handwritings of all the communications came\ngradually to exhibit more or less the same generic type.\nIn answer to a question by Mr. ZANGWILL, he stated that Mrs. Piper\nnow received ten dollars for each seance.\nMr. ANDREW LANG asked whether Dr. Hodgson had observed any\nefforts on the part of Phinuit to obtain information from the sitters.\nDr. HODGSON said that undoubtedly\u2014as had been emphatically\nstated in the previous accounts of Mrs. Piper's phenomena\u2014Phinuit\noften used to \" fish \" for information ; but this had not occurred so\nmuch lately:\u2014for some reason or other, Phinuit's conduct in this respect\nhad improved.\nIn answer to other questions, Dr. HODGSON showed that the sugges\ntion of ' ' ventriloquism \" was irrelevant ; and explained that there was\nno resemblance between the voices purporting to come from deceased\npersons and those of the persons in question. He further said that he\nhad endeavoured to obtain a physiological report on Mrs. Piper's con\ndition in the trance state ; but that the medical expert who made the\nexamination had, after some hesitation, declined to give his report\u2014\nfor fear, he believed, of its effect on his professional position.

I lay an\nhour, awake, and blinking like an over-fed owl. The weird intonation of an\nold kitchen clock fell upon my ears but faintly, as it donged the hour of two.\nThe sound of the clock chime had hardly died when I became conscious [of],\nmy position in a passenger coach on the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha\nrailroad. I was journeying to Duluth, Minnesota, from St. Paul, in which\nlatter place I had gone to sleep. I waa aware that I had been on the train\nabout four hours and that I was somewhere near the town of Shell Lake,\nWis., distant from St. Paul about eighty miles. I had often been over the\nroad, and as! peered through the coach window, I recognised, in the moonlit\nscene, features of country and habitation I had seen before. We were\nplunging on, almost heedlessly as it seemed, when I fancied I heard and\nwas startled from my reverie by a piercing shriek, which was protracted\ninto a piteous moaning and gasping, as if some human creature were suffering\nsome hideous torture.\nThen I felt the train grind heavily to an awkward stop. There was a\nsudden commotion fore and aft. Train men with lanterns hurried through\nmy car and joined employes near the engine. I could see the lights flash\nhere and there, beside and beneath the cars ; brakemen moved along the\nwheels in groups, the pipe voice of the conductor and the awe-stricken cry\nof the black porter infused a livening sense to a scene which I did not\nreadily understand. Instinctively I concluded that an accident had happened,\nor perhaps that a break to the train had occasioned this sudden uprising of\ntrain men. A minute later I was out upon the road bed. The brusque and\nbusy search and the disturbed manner of the attendants did not propitiate\nelaborate inquiry from a curious passenger, so I was appeased to be told, in.\nvery ugly snappish English, that if I had eyes I might see for myself that\n\" some one got killed, I reckon,\" Everybody moved and acted in a spirit of\nstealth, and each, it appeared, expected a horrible \" find.\" The tracks were:\nbeing examined from the rear of the train forward. Blood splotches were\ndiscovered on nearly all the bearings under the entire train. When the gang\nreached one of the forward cars, all lights were cast upon a truck which was.\nliterally scrambled with what appeared to be brains\u2014human brains,\nevidently, for among the clots were small tufts of human hair. This truck,\nparticularly, must have ground over the bulk of a human body. Every\nfixture between the wheels was smeared with the crimson ooze of some\ncrushed victim. But where waa the body, or at least its members ? The\ntrucks were covered only with a pulp of mangled remnants. The search for-\nwhat appeared of the killed was extended 500 yards back of the train and all\nabout the right-of-way with no more satisfactory result than to occasionally\nfind a blood-stained tie.\nAll hands boarded the train ; many declaring that it was an unusual\nmishap on a railroad which left su ch uncertain trace of its victim. Agaiik\nI felt the train thundering on through the burnt pine wastes of northern,\nMinnesota. As I reclined there in my berth, I reflected upon the experience\nof the night, and often befuddled my sleepy head in an effort to understand\nhow a train, pushing along at the rate of thirty miles an hour, could so>\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. LOcr., 1895.\ngrind and triturate a vital bulk, staining only trucks behind tbe engine,\nunless the killed at the fatal time were upon the truck or huddled closely by\nit. I concluded, therefore, that the being destroyed under the train had\nbeen concealed near the bespattered fixtures of the car. I had read o\u00a3\n\u2022death to tramps stealing rides by hiding themselves under or between cars,\nand finally I dismissed meditation\u2014assured that another unfortunate\nitinerant had been crushed out of existence. Horrible ! I shuddered and\n*woke\u2014relieved to comprehend it all a dream.\nNow the fact that the foregoing is an accurate statement of a dream\n\u2022experienced by me is not a matter for marvel. Taken alone, there is nothing\nremarkable in the time at which this vision blackened my sleep. The spell\nwas upon me between two and three o'clock in the morning\u2014of that I am\n\u2022certain. I am positive of the time, because, when I awoke, I heard the\n\u2022clock distinctly, as it struck three.\nOn the morrow, I,\u2014who usually forget an ordinary dream long before\nbreakfast\u2014recounted to the family the details of the night's distraction.\nfrom my hearers there followed only the ordinary comments of how ghastly\nand how shocking the story was as told and how strange the nature of the\naccident\u2014that 11,0 parts of the body had been found. The latter circumstance\nwas, to me also, quite an unusual feature of railroad casualty.\nThe evening following the night of the dream (December 30th), at 5\n\u2022o'clock, I returned to my home, stepped into my study, and, as I am in the\nhabit of doing, I glanced at a page of the St. Paul Dispatch, a daily evening\nnewspaper. It had been casually folded by a previous reader, so that in\npicking it up flatly, the article which first fixed my attention read :\n' ' Fate of a tramp. Horrible death experienced by an unknown man on\n<the Omaha Road. His remains scattered for miles along the track by the\n.merciless wheels.\n\" Duluth, December 30.\u2014Every truck on the incoming Omaha train from\n\u2022St. Paul this morning was splashed with blood. Trainmen did not know\n-there had been an accident till they arrived here, but think some unfortunate\nman must have been stealing a ride between St. Paul and this city. Train\nmen on a later train state that a man's leg was found by them at Spooner,\nand that for two miles this side the tracks were scattered with pieces of flesh\n\u2022and bone. There is no possible means of identification. \"\nHere was an evident verification of all that transpired in my mind between\ntwo and three o'clock on the previous night. I reflected, and the more I\npondered the faster I became convinced that I had been in some mysterious\nform, spirit or element, witness of the tragedy reported in the columns of\n<the press\u2014that my vision was perfect as to general details, and the\nimpression complete and exact to time, place, and circumstance. The next\nmorning I scanned the pages of the Pioneer Press of December 31st, and\nread the following paragraph : \u2014\n\" Unknown man killed, Shell Lake, Wis.

WACK.\nThe following were the corroborative letters enclosed :\u2014\n(1) St. Paul, February 2Qth, 1892.\nGENTLEMEN,\u2014Referring to an account of a dream submitted to you by\nMr. Harry Wack of this city which I have read, I beg leave to add the follow\ning facts corroborative of the narrative.\nAfter careful consideration of the article, I find that the story of the\ndream on December 29th-30th is in substance identical with that which\nwas related by Mr. Wack at breakfast\" on the morning of December 30th,\n1891. On that occasion Mr. Wack stated that he had been agitated the pre\nvious night by a dream of unusual features, and then, at the request of those\npresent, he recited what now appears in his article, which I have just perused\nfor the first time. On the evening of December 30th, 1891, when Mr. Wack\ndiscovered the newspaper item, he again mentioned the dream and called my\nattention to the newspaper item, and several of the family discussed the\nmatter. On the morning of December 31st, another newspaper clipping\nbearing on the same matter was debated by the family.\nAside from the unusual features and hideousness of the dream, there was\nnothing to startle us, until the newspaper accounts developed the affair in a\nmysterious sense. The first version of the dream was given in the morning\nof December 30th. The first newepaper dispatch appeared and was dis\ncovered in the evening of the same day. This I know of my own know\nledge, being present on each occasion.\nMRS. MARGARET B. MACDONALD.\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1895.\n(2) St. Paul, Minn., February 20th, 1892.\nGENTLEMEN,\u2014I have read the letter of Mrs. Macdonald, with whom I\n\u2022visited on December 29th, 30th, 31st, and days following, and with your per\nmission I will say that I also was present at breakfast when Mr. Waok\nmentioned the dream, and at dinner (6 p.m.) when Mr. Wack called our\n\u2022attention to the newspaper item, which he then declared was a positive\nverification of the dream he experienced the night before. I have read the\naccount of the dream, and I believe it to bo precisely as I understood it from\nMr. Wack's account given on the morning of December 30th, 1891.\nROSE B. HAMILTON.\n(3) St. Paul, February 20th, 1892.\nGENTLEMEN,\u2014Having read the foregoing letters of Mrs. Macdonald ard\nTMiss Rose B. Hamilton, and being familiar with the facts and incidents\ntherein set forth, I would add my endorsement to them as being in strict\naccord with the truth.\nMr. Wack stated his dream as he has written of it in the article which I\nunderstand he has submitted to you, on the morning of December 30th, 1891.\nHe came upon and drew our attention to the newspaper articles in the\n\u2022evening of December 30th, and on the morning of December 31st, 1891. It\nwas these newspaper dispatches which made the dream interesting, and there\nafter it was freely discussed. C. E. MCDONALD.\nMr. H. W.

I have already written you of my preliminary interview with Mr.\nWack, and it confirms in my own mind the high opinion which I previously\nheld of him through our acquaintanceship, extending over a series of years.\nThere is no reasonable doubt in my mind that the statement he makes is\nsubstantially correct, at least as respects any and all allegations of fact.\nOf course the application of these facts to an unknown force is a matter upon\n\u2022which I cannot speak. HERBERT W. SMITH.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not, responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nThe following letter was addressed to Mr. Myers, in reference to\nliis paper on Resolute Credulity, published in the Proceedings S.P.R.,\nPart XXVIII, p. 213.\nEssendon, Hatfield, Herts., August, 1895.\nI have just been reading with great interest your paper on \" Resolute\nCredulity,\" and it occurs to me that you might be not uninterested in hearing\n\u2022of an experience of mine many years ago with one of the mediums mentioned\nby you as fraudulent\u2014Williams\u2014which has led me to think that the\n\fOCT., 1895.] Correspondence. 143\nphenomena presented at his stances were due, at least in part and at times, to\nsomething beyond mere trickery.\nThe time was about 22 or 23 years ago\u2014I think in 1872\u2014but my recol\nlection of all essential parts of the occurrence is perfectly clear. I was in\nLondon for some business, dined alone at a restaurant, and, while dining,\nresolved to go in the evening to a stance at Williams' house in Lambs-conduit-\nstreet, and there, if I got a chance, try a certain experiment. When I got\nthere the room was gradually filling, till there were present some 16 or 17\npersons of both sexes including the medium. Williams was the only person\nin the room whom I had seen before. Several of them were obviously\nacquaintances of his, and any one or more might have been confederates for\nall I could tell. We took our seats at a long table, I near the medium,\nlights were put out and then followed the usual \"business\" of such stances\n\u2014musical instruments\u2014or a musical instrument\u2014carried about and playing in\nthe air, faint \"spirit lights \" seen, raps on the head from a paper tube, and\ntouches and grasps by semi-materialized spirit hands. I need not say that\nto me there was nothing convincing or even impressive in all this. For\naught I knew Williams might have been released by confederates sitting next\nhim and be careering round the room at his pleasure. My feeling was one\n\u2022of disgust at the silly ways of many of the sitters\u2014especially of certain young\nladies who were half laughing, half shrieking, when hands touched them,\nexclaiming \" Oh ! I wish a hand would touch me,\" \" Oh ! I am so\nfrightened,\" \"Oh! I don't want to be touched,\" &c., &c. Altogether\nthe clamour was considerable\u2014lights, music, touchings, all going on\nat once, so that the medium, if free and doing it all himself, must\nhave been darting about the room like an india-rubber ball, and, even\nif he had the aid of a couple of confederates, could not have a very quiet time\nof it. During a momentary pause in the racket, I said, \"I wish a hand would\ntouch me in the wny I am now thinking of. \" Almost immediately,\u2014say in\n20 seconds after I spoke\u2014I felt something like finger-tips passing very lightly\nfrom right to left across my forehead, and then my left whisker firmly grasped,\nas if by finger and thumb, and distinctly pulled three times, and less strongly\na fourth time. The three pulls were hard enough to give pain to a person\nwith a sensitive skin, which happily I am not. I said \" Thank you, that will\ndo,\" and nothing more. Now I had mentally formulated the wish that \" a\nhand should pull my left whisker four times. \" The fact that I was touched\ngoes for nothing ; but does not the exact correspondence between the touch\nand my mental request indicate that something was at work beyond mere\njugglery ? The simplest explanation which must occur to those who do not\nknow me is that I imagined the touch, influenced by expectation of that which\nI had desired. I know that I had no such expectation, rather the reverse,\nbeing annoyed and disgusted at the silly way in which the people present\nwere going on. I know, also, that I am not a nervous, excitable, impressible\nperson, that the steadiness of my nerves has been tried by excitement and\nanxiety and danger, and in the nearly 72 years of my life has never failed\nme. I am absolutely certain that the touch was real and external and not\nsubjective. It might be suggested that I had mentioned my intended experi\nment to some person of those present, which amounts, under the circum\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OcT., 1895.\nstances, to saying that I acted like an idiot. It seems to me absolutely-\ncertain that my thought was read by some intelligence in the flesh or out of\nit, however the actual touch was effected. If Williams touched me, having-\npreviously read my thought, it certainly was a most singular case of thought-\nreading, for instead of the quiescence and attentive waiting usual with\nthought-readers, he must have been in a state of great activity of mind and\nbody. In any case some kind of supernormal power was inaction. If on\nthe part of Williams, it seems to me to suggest a probability that his whole-\nproceedings at that time were genuine. WM. S. GRIGNON.\nMESMERIC PASSES.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OP THE INCORPORATED S.P.R.\nFieldhead, Wimbledon Park, Surrey, July 23rd.\nSIR,\u2014Dr. Green in your last number asks the question, Have the-\nmesmeric passes any utility per se ? and he himself answers the question\nmainly in the affirmative.\nFor myself, I have been a practical mesmerist from the year 1839-40, and\nI have found that successful mesmerists, without exception, believe that an\naura or influence passes from their positive hands to the negative or receptive*\nbody of the subject.* They believe this for the following reasons :\u2014\n1. Because they are conscious of the sensation as of tingling at the tips\nof their fingers as they earnestly make the passes. 2. Because the patient\nalmost always admits that he or she experiences sensations as if receiving\nan emanation from the operator, and describes it as exciting, irritating, or\nsoothing. 3. Because I have found sometimes that if I made the passes\nwith much mental determination the patient has said, \" I feel your influence!\nstrongly,\" or \" I feel it exciting ;\" but when I have made the\u00abpasses auto\nmatically and without much will the patient has said, \" I don't feel any\nthing.\" 4. Because most mesmerists when successful feel themselves more\nor less depleted, and desire to wash their hands, go out into the air, or\ntake a glass of wine. 5. Because clairvoyants generally see an aura as\nemanating from mesmeric hands, and describe its colour as red, violet, or\nwhite, and I may add that my own colour is invariably described as violet.\n6. Patients are often more benefited by contact of the hand than by\npasses, and vice -versa, indicating occult properties in the mesmeric hand.\n7. This aura has sometimes been, although invisible to the ordinary eye,.\nrevealed by the photographic plate.\nIn conclusion I might define hypnotic cures as the result of the will of the\noperator as dominating the higher or semi-entranced soul of the patient, and\nmesmeric cures as the result of the same ordeal, but plus the influence of\nthe vital force the patient receives during the mesmeric passes.\nIn hynotic cases the patient is put into a peculiar condition, but in many\nmesmeric cases, as in the cure of neuralgia, the patient appears to be cured\nby the influence of the passes only.\u2014Your obedient servant,\nGEORGE WYW>, M.D.EDIN.\n* This view is not held by any English hypnotists of my acquaintance, and I\nbelieve that it has been abandoned by almost all the most eminent medical men who\npractise hypnotism abroad.\u2014ED.\n\fNo. CXXIII.\u2014Vol. VII.

[Nov., 1895.\nThe Council desires to record the great indebtedness of the Society\nto Messrs. H. Arthur Smith'and Sydney C. Scott for the large amount\nof time and labour which they have devoted to carrying through the\nIncorporation of the Society, and which has enabled it to be completed\nat much less cost than would otherwise have been the case.\nVarious other matters having been discussed, the Council agreed\nthat its next meeting should be at 3 o'clock, on Friday, December 6th,\nat the Westminster Town Hall, previous to the General Meeting\narranged for 4 p.m. on that day.\nEUSAPIA PALADINO.\nA full record of the experiments at Cambridge with Eusapia\nPaladino would be intolerably tedious and unreadable. What is\nproposed here is to give a sufficient account to justify the conclusion\nat which, at the close of the seances, the investigators unanimously\narrived, viz., that systematic fraud had been used from first to>\nlast, and that there was no adequate reason to suppose any super\nnormal agency whatever.\nI may begin by reminding the readers of the Journal that, when\nProfessor Lodge's report, printed in the November Journal of last\nyear, became known to Dr. Hodgson, he at once challenged the\nvalidity of Professor Lodge's conclusions, and in a paper printed in\nthe March-April Journal, argued that the alleged supernormal\nphenomena might all be explained by trickery. He suggested\ntrickery of various kinds, but especially drew attention to the\ndefective holding of the hands, for which, as previous observers had\nremarked, Eusapia manifested a decided preference. He quoted\npassages from an article by Professor Richet, in the Annales des\nSciences Psychiques (Jan.-Feb., 1893), in which this defective holding\nwas accurately and fully described, and the opportunity it gave for\nfraud was pointed out.\nAs our ultimate conclusion was that the trick there described\nconstituted Eusapia's main, though not her sole, method of fraud,\nI will give a translation of the passage in question, for the con\nvenience of the reader who may be interested in comparing it with\nour own results.\n[From the Annales des Sciences Psychiques, Jan.-Feb., 1893, p. 14.]\nIn the experiments, Eusapia does not generally have both her right and\nleft hands held in the same way. On one side her wrist and hand are held\n\fNov., 1895.] Eusapia Paladino. 149\nfirmly ; on the other side, instead of having her hand held by the sitter,\nshe merely places her hand on his, but pressing with all the fingers, so that\nhe can feel very distinctly whether he has the right or the left hand. Then\nat the moment when the phenomenon is going to begin, this hand which is\nnot held, but is resting on the sitter's hand, (let us say, for simplicity,\nEusapia's right hand, though it may be either the right or the left) becomes\nvery mobile ; it moves about constantly, and during a minute fraction of a\nsecond the sitter does not feel it ; then he feels it again, and can verify that\nit is still the right hand.\nThus it is possible that during this fraction of a second, the right hand\nof Eusapia may become free, and move to the right or left, touching the\nhead, face, or neck of one of the sitters. Further, her left hand, held by\nthe wrist, may place itself on the back of the hand of her right-hand\nneighbour, who still believes that he ha' her right hand, when it is really\nEusapia's left hand that is touching him ; and thus her right hand is\nabsolutely free.\nSo far for the hands. As regards the feet, Professor Richet in\nanother place refers to an experiment in which the feet of Eusapia\nwere controlled by being each placed sometimes above, sometimes\nbelow the foot of an investigator on either side, and expresses the view\nthat this holding of the feet of Eusapia by the feet of the sitters\nis \" an illusory control.\" At Cambridge we took the same view as\nProfessor Richet with regard to the holding of the feet, and always\nendeavoured to have them secured by the hands of one of the investi\ngators placed under the table. This was usually allowed by Eusapia\nfor part of each sitting, but generally only for part, so that a good\ndeal of the imperfect holding of feet by feet was allowed by us to go\non in order not to irritate the medium. We did not, however,\nregard the results obtained with such holding\u2014so far as they could\nbe performed by a foot getting free\u2014as being of any evidential value.\nWe did not, therefore, at first pay much attention to the feet other\nwise than to note when they were held securely by hands and when\nthey were not so held. As regards the hands, the need of closer\nobservation was strongly felt from the first. During the earlier sittings\nwe concentrated our main efforts on getting a perfectly secure holding\nof both hands at the time when phenomena occurred clearly requiring\nthe use of a hand, if produced by natural means. But though we\nrepeatedly urged Eusapia to allow this complete security of holding,\nwe did not think it right to constrain her : accordingly, the defective\nholding described by Professor Richet was repeatedly noted by\ndifferent observers. I will give one description of such holding by\nMrs. H. M. Stanley, written the morning after the second of the series\nof seances.\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research [Nov., 1895..\nNotes on Seance of August 3rd, 1895.\n[Written on the morning of August 4th.]\nI felt Eusapia's right hand in my left, she then turned my hand over,,\n(palm down ) and placed hers upon it on the table, rather close to her, and\nsomewhat away from me, towards her left. The first time I thought that\nEusapia drew my hand and hers to Mrs. Verral1's, who was holding Eusapia's\nleft hand. Eusapia patted my hand, but never removed her hand actually-\ntrom off my hand. After a while I felt what I thought was only three, or, at one\ntime, only two fingers lying close and tightly upon the back of my hand. I\nfelt that Eusapia had not taken away her hand, but that she had withdrawn:\ntwo fingers, leaving me the feeling of a narrowed hand. After every\nnarrowing or diminishing of Eusapia's hand on mine, something happened\nto me ; I was always touched. I came at last so much to expect this that\nI called out to my sister, \"Now, something is going to happen, I feel her\nhand narrowing; there is less of her hand on mine.\" At that moment I would\nfeel my elbow pinched, or a spread hand on ray back, or a hand on my right\nshoulder. All this while my left hand was clutched by the same hot nervous\nfingers ; I had all the sensations of a living hand on mine, but not a complete\nhand. When the phenomenon was over\u2014I mean, as soon as the push, or\npinch, or slap, had been given,\u2014then, for the first time, the fingers (or\ndiminished hand ) let go of my hand, and in an instant, Eusapia's complete\nhand closed over the back of my left hand ; it was then colder than the hand '\nor fingers which had been upon mine during the phenomenon.\nDOEOTHY STANLEY.\nThe reader will not be surprised to learn that, after this description,.\nMrs. Sidgwick recorded her opinion that \"if things rest as they stand\nnow, the presumption in favour of trickery seems to me to be very great.>v\nStill,' other phenomena occurred which did not appear to be explic\nable by the simple supposition that the hand had got free through\ndefective holding. Accordingly, for the greater part of the sittings,\nwe continued to direct our attention to the obtaining of genuine\nphenomena under unimpeachable conditions rather than to the\ndiscovery of fraud.\nBut when Dr. Hodgson arrived, the time seemed to have come for\na change of plan. Instead of indicating any desire to hold as securely\nas possible, Dr. Hodgson left Eusapia entirely free to hold his hand\nas she liked, and concentrated his attention on observing more exactly\nthe process described by Mrs. Stanley, which had by that time become\nquite familiar to the sitters. The result of this observation was to\nconvince Dr. Hodgson first and then the rest of the investigators,\nthat the substitution of hands described by Professor Bichet as possible\nactually occurred in this process, and could be observed if attention\nwas carefully directed to it.\n\fNov., 1895.] Eusapia Paladino. 151\nI give now extracts from the report of one of the later seances, at\n\u2022which Dr. Hodgson was present.\nExtractsfrom Report of Seance of September 1st, 1895.\n[The Report consists of notes taken by Mr. Myers at the time from the\ndictation of the sitters, with supplementary statements added by some of the\nsitters afterwards ; these are placed in square brackets, and all except those\nto which Mrs. Sidgwick's initials are appended were written by Dr. Hodgson\non September 2nd and 3rd.

At the beginning of the process my left hand\nwas near the edge of the table on my side, palm upward, and E. was\ngrasping it firmly with her right hand ; I could feel the right thumb and some\nof the fingers which were more or less mingled with mine. Slowly and\ngradually, by slight jerks, she drew my hand about half way across the table,\nas it seemed, changing her grasp a good deal in the meantime. She then\nshifted my hand a little from side to side and finally turned it over so that\nit was palm downward, resting on the table. She then worked her hand and\nfingers much in a shifting manner on the back of my hand, pinching my\nfingers slightly and drawing my hand gradually still further across the table.\nSome discussion took place then between E. and F. D. as to the manner in\nwhich the latter was holding E.'s left hand, and E. lifted my hand somewhat\nback in my direction, and somewhat to my right, to prevent, as I supposed,\nthe possibility of F. D. 's hand coming into contact with mine. Her right\nhand then left mine and was apparently engaged in helping her to explain to\nF. D. the remarks she was making about his holding. After a brief interval\nthe right hand returned to my left, and worked with it as before, taking it\nfurther across the table. Her fingers got closer together gradually and\nnearer the ends of my own fingers, and I felt the pressures changing and\nother pressures being substituted, and knew that E.'s right hand was\nfree. After the production of the phenomenon I felt the hand return to mine,\nfirst the fingers, then the grasp round my hand. This process was repeated\nfrequentlv in connection with the following phenomena, but became more\nand more abridged, as E. became more confident\u2014I suppose\u2014that its nature\nwas not suspected. In most of the cases the substituted pressures appeared\nto be produced by the fingers of her other hand ; that is to say, they suggested\nfingers, and my hand was evidently in close vicinity to her other hand ;\nbut on two or three occasions, to be mentioned later, the substituted pressure\nappeared to be produced by something other than fingers.]\nDarkness made complete.

The control was, of course, an entirely\ni llusory one, under the circumstances.\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychhical Research. [Nov., 1895.\nI will add one incident from a later sitting, which enlarged our-\nideas of the possibility of a trick with the foot, even when the holding\nof the feet was of a kind that we regarded as secure, i.e., when they\nwere held by the hands of a person under the table. I had frequently\nasked Eusapia\u2014or rather \"John\"\u2014to favour me with a hand-grasp\nwhen I was holding the two hands of the medium in my two hands,\nsince I regarded this as the only mode of holding the hands which could\never be perfectly satisfactory to myself. \" John \" had promised to do\nthis, but had not yet fulfilled his promise. Eusapia, inferring from\nDr. Hodgson's complaisance that he was an inobservant holder, thought\nthe time had come to gratify me. Accordingly, Dr. Hodgson having\ngone under the table to hold her feet, she insisted on his turning his left\nhand back upwards, and was then observed by him to make her left\nfoot do duty for two, thus getting her right foot free. In the mean\nwhile, without being asked to do so, she had given me both her hands.\nI was then touched on the thigh in a way that could easily be managed\nwith the right foot. She spoke joyfully afterwards of having at last\nsucceeded in giving me the phenomenon long asked for, under the con\nditions prescribed.\nThe phenomena described by Dr. Hodgson were afterwards repro\nduced with more or less completeness in the experience of other sitters.\nI give, as an example of these later observations by members of the\ncircle other than Dr. Hodgson, the following notes written by Miss\nJohnson the day after the seance at which the incidents occurred.\nNotes on Seance of September 6th, 1895.\n[Written on September 7th.]\nThe first touch I felt last night was one that could easily have been done\nby Eusapia's foot. Mrs. Myers immediately afterwards went under the table\nand held her feet, while Mr. Myers had the left hand and I was supposed to\nbe having the right hand. Then came a long series of phenomena, chiefly\ngrasps, which it seemed clear to me were done by the right hand. They were\npreceded by nearly an hour's interval, during which Eusapia kept on asking;\nfor less and less light, and fussed about with the curtains, etc. Then she\nbegan practising on my hand. She kept it generally, palm downwards, on\nthe table, with her right hand pressing on it, sometimes squeezing it between\nher right thumb and fingers. Often I could feel the thumb, then the hand\nwould be lifted, with the tips of the fingers only on me\u2014so that I could not\nhave told which hand it was\u2014but constantly the whole hand and thumb\nwould come back, as if to assure me that it was the same hand all the time.\nThen what I took for an actual substitution began, the fingers of the left\nhand being apparently put on mine instead of the right hand, for a few\nmoments, after which the right hand returned and grasped me, so that I\n\fNov. 1895.] Eusapia Paladino. 157\n\u2022could feel the thumb again. The difference between the right and left fingers\nwas something very slight and difficult to define, but I think I was aware of\ntheir sloping in a different direction. My hand had meanwhile been drawn\ngradually across the table and I was aware that it was now close to Mr.\nMyers'. Twice I thought that the substitution had taken place, and gave\nwarning of it, expecting a phenomenon, but nothing happened. The third\ntime I was certain of the substitution\u2014i.e. certain that the right hand had left\nme and that something else was on me\u2014and after this I felt a distinct grasp,\nas of a hand squeezing my back. Then the right hand came back and\nsqueezed me hard, so that I could feel the thumb again. After this first\ntouch, phenomena began to occur with great rapidity. All those requiring a\nliand that occurred while the feet were held appeared to me to be done by\nEusapia's right hand. I felt the hand coming back and grasping me after\nevery one of them, and was clearly aware of the previous substitution in all\nbut two or three cases, where, I think, my attention had been diverted tor a\nmoment.\nThe object substituted was not always the same, but I think it was\nalways part of a fore-arm or hand,\u2014in the early cases, probably the left\nfingers ; in the later cases, when Eusapia became more reckless, any\nthing else that happened to be convenient. When Mrs. Myers was first\ntouched under the table, I felt the edge of an arm\u2014which I took to be the\nulnar side of the left arm\u2014resting on me. On other occasions it appeared\nto be the bare left fore-arm which was on me. Once or twice it was the bare\nright fore-arm. I distinguished them partly by the slope. At frequent\nintervals,\u2014but always between phenomena\u2014the whole right arm was resting\non the table, parallel with and pressed against my left arm. Then it would\nmove along so that the fore-arm rested on my hand, leaving the hand free.\nOr more often, it would move away and the left fore-arm would appear to\npress on me instead.\nI tried constantly to obtain a better holding and this was frequently\nallowed in the intervals between phenomena, my hand being allowed to turn\npalm upwards and feel about pretty freely. But it was invariably turned\npalm down again before anything began, and then generally pressed hard on\nthe table, so that I could not have moved it without a great effort.\nSometimes I thought it was the knuckles or outer side of the joints of\nthe left fingers that were pressing on me ; sometimes it was their tips. On\none occasion I felt the nails, and these clearly indicated\u2014by the slope and\nposition\u2014that it was the left fingers. I turned my fingers slightly up to\nfeel them.\nMr. Myers was obliged all the time to hold the left hand in such a way\nthat part of it might have been used as described.\nThe only difficulty in the way of this explanation was the question\nwhether the left hand was near enough to the right to be substituted for it.\nThere was no evidence at any time that the two hands were not near\n\u2022enough, and often it was clear that they were. At the beginning, my hand\n\u2022was drawn far across the table towards Mr. Myers. When he was holding\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1895,\nthe left hand below the table, the right hand was holding mine on the right\nthigh. When, as often happened, he was holding the left hand in the air\nabove the table, I several times felt the ends of fingers on me, as if the left\nfingers were stretching straight down from above. Once, when his hand was\nin the air, my hand was put on to the accordion which was on the table, as if\nto lift it towards his. Once Mr. Myers' hand was moved towards me,\nostensibly to show how far apart the hands were, just after my hand had\nbeen withdrawn towards my side of the table.\nWhile Mrs. Myers had the left hand and I the right, it was almost\nalways the left hand that was used to produce the phenomena, and she then\nobserved processes of substitution similar to what I had been observing on\nthe right. Most of the time, the right hand was enclosing mine so that I\nhad no control of the fingers, and a chair lying on the table enabled us to\nlocate positions, so that we knew that the right and left hands were near\ntogether. The phenomena followed one another very quickly, but we\nthought we could account for each one of them as it occurred.\nThe feet were used very little, being held most of the time. Four cases\nare described in the notes. The last was interesting, as simulating a grasp\nby a hand. I felt a touch on my left hip, three points of contact at once.\nIt felt something like a hand, but gave one the impression rather of a\ndeformed hand, with incomplete fingers. I think it was produced by the\nsole of the foot being curved, so that only the heel and toes touched me, the\nheel making one point of contact, and the toes the other two\u2014the great toe\nbeing very slightly opposed to the others.\nSeveral times during the evening, we saw \"John's\" hand or fingers\nagainst the chinks or openings of the curtains of the recess, sometimes\nwhen some one was being touched, and sometimes not. I also saw \" John's\nhead \" once. On all these occasions, there was clear evidence that Eusapia's\nhand or head was free at the time. With regard to the \"head,\" I noticed a\ncurious illusion which I cannot explain, viz., that while something in the\nappearance suggested to me that the \"head \" was on a level with the further\nend of the table\u2014which Eusapia's head could hardly have reached unless\nshe stood up and leant far forward\u2014something else gave me the impression\nthat the \"head \" was only at the point that she could easily have reached\nwithout standing. She was actually sitting at the time, and I have no doubt\nthat the latter impression was the correct one. But if this second element\nin the perception had been missing, I should have thought I had seen a\nhead in a position where it was almost impossible for Eusapia's head to be.\nALICE JOHNSON.\nMr. Myers writes :\u2014\nSeptember 7th, 1895.\nMy experience was complementary to Miss Johnson's. On one occasion I\nfelt sure that the hand which I held was too high in the air for its fingers to\ntouch Miss Johnson's hand, which I assumed to be on the table. But that\nwas the very occasion when Miss Johnson's hand had, as it proved, been\npreviously placed on the accordion. On one occasion I felt almost sure that\n\fNov., 1895.] International Congress of Psychology. 159\nthe ends of the fingers of the hand felt by me were being used to press on\nsomething else,\u2014i.e. on Miss Johnson's hand. I felt a slight muscular strain\nin the fingers in question. F. W. H. MYERS.\nAfter the observations of which these are specimens, we had no\ndoubt that the defective holding\u2014which, as I have said, had been\nfrequently noted from first to last\u2014had all along been used for fraud.\nWe then carefully examined those experiences in the earlier sittings\nwhich at the time had appeared to us not to be explicable by the\nmere supposition that one hand was fraudulently freed. Considering\nthese in the light of the insight that we had now gained into Eusapia's\nmethods, and making due allowance for imperfect observation, or\nimperfect record of observation, in the case of one or two of the less\nexperienced sitters, we\u2014that is, Mr. and Mrs. Myers, Miss Johnson,\nMrs. Sidgwick, and myself, as well as Dr. Hodgson,\u2014unanimously\nadopted the conclusion that nothing but trickery had been at work in\nthe Cambridge series of experiments.\nHENRY SIDGWICK.\nTHE THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF\nPSYCHOLOGY.\nWe have received invitations to the third International Congress\nof Psychology, to be held at Munich, August 4th-7th, 1896.

A\u00ab Pn Collective Auditory.\nThis case was sent to us by Miss Ada McNeill, of Cushenden\nHouse, Co. Antrim, who obtained it from her cousin, Miss Key.\nMiss Key writes ;\u2014\nMarch llth, 1895.\nIt was on March 16th, 1891, in London ; I had gone up to bed early,\nleaving my hostess in the drawing-room. I had only been in my room a few\nminutes when I began to feel very faint ; so much so and so suddenly, that\neverything was black before my eyes before I could look for the bell. I\nstumbled to the bed and threw myself upon it. As I did so 1 thought to\nmyself : \" Oh, if only I could ring the bell ! How I do wish I could ring the\nbell ! \" for I did not like the idea of fainting alone, when it was not probable\nthat any one would come to my room that night. I was still struggling to\nkeep my consciousness when the housemaid came into my room. I was feel\ning too ill to be much surprised at the moment, but when I had quite\nrecovered and the housemaid had left the room, it struck me as strange that\nshe should have come in.\nThe next morning I said to my hostess : \"I wonder why the housemaid\ncame to my room last night. I did not expect her.\"\n\" Oh,\" said my friend, \" I sent her. I heard your bell ring, and as she\ndid not answer it I called to her to go.\"\nI laughed. \" But I didn't ring ! I couldn't even see where the bell was,\nthough I wanted very much to ring ! \"\n\" Nonsense,\" said my friend, \" I fceardthe bell ! You must have rung it\nwithout knowing what you were doing, when you were on your way to the\nbed.\"\nI thought to myself ; \" Well, I am perfectly sure I did not ring that bell,\nbut I'll go and see whereabouts in the room it is. If, for instance, it is on the\nfurther side of the bed from where I was standing, perhaps she will believe\nI did not ring it mechanically. \"\nWhen I went up to my room I found there was no bell in it.\nMAUD M.

We found out afterwards that there was\na little bell wire just below the ceiling over the fireplace, meant to have a\ncord attached, but at the time there was no cord, as we did not know it was\nthere. It could not have been reached without standing on a chair, and even\nthen would have been almost impossible to pull, as it was so small. I am\nperfectly sure Maud could not have pulled it. Maud had gone to bed early\nas she was feeling unwell, and I was sitting downstairs, when I suddenly\nheard a strange bell ring. I knew all the bells so well that I was utterly\nastonished to hear the strange one, and ran out of the drawing-room to meet\nthe maid on the staira. She was as much surprised as I was, and I think we\nboth ran up to Maud's room, feeling very queer, as we thought there was no\nbell there. The rest you know. I really forget whether we found her lying\non the bed, or on the floor, and helped her to bed, but that has nothing to\ndo with the story of the bell. As there was a bell there (though we did not\nknow it) the ring may have been caused by a mouse on the wire, but even\nthen it was very remarkable that it should happen just at that moment.\n* * * *\nCONSTANCE MONRO.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nCONCERNING EUSAPIA PALADINO.\nOctober 17th, 1895.\nSIR.\u2014We all ought to be grateful to anyone who exposes fraud ; and\nif Eusapia Paladino can cheat we ought to know it. Feeling this, there are\nmany who regretted that at the meeting of the Society on the 11th, there\nwas no time for explanation or questioning. We were certainly not told\nwhat Eusapia did as a cheat, and how she did it. That curious muddle of\ndemonstration as to her manipulation of hands seemed singularly useless.\nThe report of the convincing experiments on \" the island \" shewed that\nEusapia's hands were very carefully held, while Dr. Hodgson's slight reference\nto deception turned upon Eusapia's holding other people's hands. Neither\ncould we see the remotest bearing of Dr. Hodgson's odd remark that he had\ncheated somewhere by putting his toes on one foot of an experimenter, and\nhis heel upon another, and had thus induced him to believe that both his feet\nwere in contact with the experimenter's feet, and therefore not available for\ntricks. But here again, if we want to secure the feet of a medium by contact,\nwe do not allow the medium to put his feet on the experimenter's but the\nreverse. At \" the island \" experiments, Eusapia's feet were specially held.\nSee The Journal for March and April, pages 56, 57, 67.\nIt is the oddest thing imaginable that at \"the island,\" with the most\nstringent tests, the evidence seemed conclusive ; while, with admittedly loose\nconditions at Cambridge, the evidence seemed to go to pieces. Is it possible\nthat the poor woman was over anxious, and took advantage of the little trap\ndeliberately opened for her ? Dr. Hodgson told us that the conditions were\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1895,\nrelaxed on purpose that her methods might be followed ! Or may we say that\nthe great doctrine of telepathy or thought-transference, which is made to>\naccount for so many things, will account for Eusapia doing precisely what\nDr. Hodgson had decided she could and would do ? If half of what the leaders\nof the Society say about thought-transference is true, it seems to me perfectly\nplain that two such masterful minds as Professor Sidgwick and Dr. Hodgson\ncould make ( and could unconsciously make ) a sensitive like Eusapia do\nanything.\nAnyhow, we are a hundred miles away from any proof that Eusapia is\na fraud, and only a fraud. Whether she is a mixture is another matter-\nMost of us are that ! J. PAGE HOPPS.\nREPLY TO MR. PAGE HOPPS, CONCERNING EUSAPIA PALADINO.\nBy F. W. H. Myers.\nThe report of the meeting on October 11th, printed in the October\nJournal, will have met some of Mr. Page Hopps' questions. But there are\nstill some points on which explicit statements by me may be of use. It will\nbe understood that in what follows I am speaking of the Cambridge seances\nalone.\nEusapia Paladino stayed in my house for seven weeks, and we held twenty-\nseances ; the persons present being from time to time varied, and including\nseveral men of high eminence in the scientific world. During all that time\nEusapia persistently threw obstacles in the way of proper holding of the\nhands ; she only allowed for a part of the time on each occasion the only\nholding of the feet which we regarded as secure, \u2014i.e. the holding by the\nhands of a person under the table. Moreover she repeatedly refused any\nsatisfactory test other than holding. Generally we endeavoured to make the\nholding as good as she would allow us to make it ; although towards the end\nwe occasionally left her quite free to be held or to hold as she pleased ;\u2014on\nwhich occasions she continued the same frauds, in a more obvious manner.\nThe frauds were practised both in and out of the real or alleged trance, and\nwere so skilfully executed that \" the poor woman \" must have practised them\nlong and carefully.\nMost of the regular sitters were, in fact, at first disposed to believe the\nphenomena genuine, and sympathy and encouragement were certainly not\nlacking. With the exception of a few days of trifling ailment, Eusapia was\nin good health all the time, and appeared to be very much at her ease, quite\nhappy, and very unwilling to leave us. Since she was going to a group of\ninvestigators in Prance on leaving us, I considered it my duty not to interfere\nwith their investigation by making known our discoveries in any complete\nway to Eusapia herself. We frequently, however, explained both to her and\nto \"John\", her alleged control, the defects in the holding and in the other\nconditions allowed, but with no resulting benefit ;\u2014only accesses of ' ' John's ''\nreal or pretended anger, and gradual diminution of phenomena of any kind.\nThough Dr. Hodgson's experience and insight were of the greatest value to\nus, he was actually present at only a few of the seances, and Professor\nSidgwick was absent from some of them. The presence or absence of these\nobservers made no perceptible alteration in the general character of the phe\nnomena. At the close of the seances, on a comparison of all the recorded\nobservations, I\u2014as well as Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick\u2014had no doubt that\nsystematic trickery had been used from first to last, and that there was no\nadequate ground for attributing any of the phenomena occurring at these\nsittings to a supernormal cause.\n\fNo. CXXIV.\u2014VOL.

PAGE\nSpirit Photography (with Illustrations).. 1G5\nA Becent Case of \" Faith-Healing \" 172\nCases 173\nCorrespondence: Eusapia Paladino 178\nNotice 180\nSPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY.\nWe think that our readers may be interested in the following\nanalysis of a case which has recently been brought to our notice as one\nof supposed \" spirit photography,\" the importance of which seemed to\nbe considerably enhanced by its involving a very well-authenticated\ncoincidence. It will be seen, however, that the lady who took the\nphotograph\u2014Miss S. R. Corbet\u2014was from the first fully alive to the\ninconclusive nature of the evidence for any supernormal agency being\nconcerned in its production. We are indebted in the first instance for\ninformation about the case to Lady Fitzgerald, through whose kind\nness Professor Barrett was put into ; communication with the persons\nconcerned. From a mass of correspondence on the subject, Professor\nBarrett put together in June, 1895, the account printed below, which\nwas afterwards corrected and signed by Miss Corbet.\nMiss Sybell Corbet, when staying with her sister, Lady S., at D. Hall\n[assumed name], took a photograph of the library in the afternoon of\nDecember 5th, 1891, between 2 and 3 o'clock. The exposure was rather a,\nlong one. No one was present with Miss Corbet when the picture was\ntaken, but on developing the negative, the head and body of an elderly\ngentleman appeared seated on a high-backed, old oak chair, one arm resting\non the arm of the chair, the other arm of the figure and the legs being\ninvisible. The figure, in fact, only went down to the waist, and though the\nface was rather indistinct, it appeared to have a short beard. When the\npicture was shown to one of the nearest relatives of Lord D. , the late owner\nof D. Hall, she thought it exactly like him ; others, however, who knew\nhim, think it too indistinct to be sure of any likeness. Strangely enough, it\nturned out that the funeral of Lord D. was taking place on the very same\nday and hour at which the photograph was taken.\nMiss Corbet is sure the plate had not been exposed before, and was\none of a parcel of dry Ilford plates. Unfortunately, the exposure being\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. \\D\u00abc., 1895.\nsomewhat long, she was not in the room the whole time, and did not\nlook the doors when she left the room ; but the only men in the house\nwere her youngest brother, the butler, and two footmen, and all these four\nwere young men and beardless. In answer to inquiries, Miss Corbet states\nthat the servants would not be at all likely to have entered the room, and her\nbrother declares he did not. None of them would, she is certain, be likely\nto play a practical joke, and even if they did, the difficulty would be to\nexplain the production of an older, bearded figure, without legs, and one\nconsidered by some of his near relatives to be very like Lord D. and entirely\nunlike any men living in the house.\nThe men were all young and clean-shaven, except Miss Corbet's brother,\nwho had a moustache, and who is not in the least like the figure indepen\ndently of this.\nI certify the foregoing account to be correct in every particular.\nSYBELL R. CORBET.\nThe date is fixed by two separate notes made by Miss Corbet, \u2014\u2022\nat a time, when, as explained below, she had not observed the\ncoincidence,\u2014as follows :\u2014\u2022\nEntry in photor\/raphic note-book. \u2014December 5th, 1891 : subject, library,\nD. ; exposure, 60 minutes ; plate, Ilford Ordinary ; hour, 2 to 3 p.m.\nKntry in diary.\u2014December 5th, 1891 : Lord D. buried at W. Church [two\nmiles from D.]\nThe following extracts from letters in our possession written by\nMiss Corbet give further details.\nKingsland House, Shrewsbury.\nMay 2nd, 1895.\nThere are the most contradictory opinions about the likeness of the figure\nin my D. photograph to Lord D. My sister thought it so like him that she\nbegged me to look out the date on which I had taken it, when I first noticed\nthat it was taken at the very time of Lord D.'s funeral. Since that, people\nwho knew him well have declared it was not in the least like him ; others\nwho knew him equally well that it was. But to my mind it is not clear\nenough to form a very definite opinion about, as the features are hidden by\na standard lamp. .\nIt is a curious coincidence ;\u2014an unaccountable figure appearing in a\nphotograph taken at that particular date, and that the figure should, in the\nopinions of some who knew him most intimately, resemble Lord D.\nJune 12th, 1895.\nYou ask if there is any possibility of the plate having been exposed\nbefore. So far as I am aware, none, as I always keep a very careful account\nof every plate I expose ; or rather I should say. no probability, as I have\nnever exposed a plate twice without becoming aware of my mistake on taking\nout the dark slides ; and, moreover, I had in those days never taken a human\nfigure\u2014excepting as a minute object in a landscape\u2014so the figure would still\n\fDEO., 167\nSpirit Photography.\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1895.\nbe unaccounted for. However, I am told by some photographers and others\nthat the pre-exposure may happen during the sensitising of the dry plate.\nOf this, of course, I know nothing. The fact remains a curious one, I\nthink, although some photographers declare there is nothing odd in it\u2014mere\naccident and chance. But I quite agree with you that, as it is impossible to\nprove that no one entered the room, it cannot be regarded \"as affording\nindubitable evidence of a 'spirit photograph.'\"\nJuly 22nd, 1895.\nI did not develop the plate until August of the following year, when I first\nbecame aware of the presence of an unexpected figure ; hut it was not until my\neldest sister, Mrs. R., suggested a likeness to the late Lord D., and asked me\nff it was taken before or after his death, that I referred to my note-book and\ndiary, and found that it was on the day of the funeral (he died in London,\nbut was buried in the Church near D. ). On later inquiry, I also discovered\nthat the time corresponded, the funeral being a little late, in consequence of\nthe lateness of the special train ; in fact, that during part of the exposure,\nthe service was waiting the arrival of some of the principal mourners. My\nsister, Lady S., was renting D. Hall at this time ; and, so far as I can\nremember, several of us (my sisters) were there when I arranged the camera,\nafter which we all went out, leaving the plate exposed, and the room quite\nempty ! I had no particular interest in [the] arm-chair, and have never been\nable to discover that Lord D. was in the habit of using it, as he usually\noccupied a smaller room, on the ground floor, when alone.\nIn the photograph, which is here reproduced, half of the upper\npart of the figure of a man appears seated in the large chair on the\nleft. The high stand, carrying a flower-pot, in front of the chair seems\nto cut off the other half of the face and body of the figure. The lower\npart of the body and the legs are entirely wanting ; the head is semi-\ntransparent and the face very indistinct. A vague semblance of an\neye-brow, an eye, and a nose is seen on careful examination to be\nreally the carving of the back of the chair showing through.* It is\nimpossible to make out with certainty whether the face wears a beard\nor not, but the head appears to be quite bald, and there is something\nlike a stock round the neck, which adds to the appearance of age.\nThese features were perhaps mainly instrumental in suggesting the\nrecognition.\nWith regard to the possibility that one of the footmen might have\ngot taken, either accidentally or as a practical joke, Miss Corbet points\nout .that the dress of the figure is apparently that of a gentleman,\nwhereas her sister's footmen always wore livery, although at that time\n* AH these points, as well as the semi-transparency of the figure as compared with '\nthe solid objects surrounding it, are naturally shown more clearly in the photograph\nthan in the reproduction.\n\fDEO., 1895.] Spirit Photography. 169\nEXPERIMENTAL PHOTOGRAPH BY PROFESSOR BARRETT AND\nMR. GORDON SALT.\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEc.,\nthey were in mourning. She thinks it more possible, although very\nimprobable, that some stranger came in for a few minutes ; the butler\ndeclared that no one did so, but, unfortunately, enquiry was not made\nuntil some time after the event.\nThe incompleteness of the figure, together with the supposition\nthat the room was empty while the photograph was being taken,\nsuggested the possibility that it was produced by something other than\nan ordinary man, and the interest of this suggestion was much\nheightened by the undoubted fact that Lord D.'s funeral was actually\noccurring at the time.\nProfessor Barrett, however, with the aid of Mr. Gordon Salt,\nexperimented on the effects that could be produced by the transitory\nintroduction of a figure during a long exposure of a plate. The results\nthus obtained by a person coming into the room, sitting on a chair\nand moving his legs, were so very like the reputed ghost picture that\nProfessor Barrett writes :\u2014\nSeptember 5th, 1895.\nI can see how the \"ghost\" picture may have occurred, as I have\nsucceeded in reproducing it almost exactly. I believe that one of the\nservants came into the room, sat down in the chair, crossed his legs and\nthen uncrossed them, looked down for a moment and then at the camera,\nsaw he was being taken, so got up and went away, having been in the chair\nabout 20 to 30 seconds. This will give the ghost of an apparently older\nman from a young man, with no legs, and a semi-transparent face, &c.\nProfessor Barrett's photograph is also reproduced on p. 169, and\nwill be seen to be very similar in appearance to the other, only half\nof the upper part of the figure\u2014the half most strongly lighted\u2014\nbeing shown, and this being semi-transparent. There are very faint\nindications of features in the face, and the chin, being abnormally\nlong and with no distinct outline, looks as though there were a short\nwhite beard. A similar indefiniteness of outline on the right side\nof the collar simulates the folds of a stock, and, as in Miss Corbet's\nphotograph, the legs are entirely absent.\nFurther light was thrown on the possible method of production\nof Miss Corbet's photograph by Dr. H. D. R. Kingston, of Stor-\nmont Lodge, Willesden, N.W., an Associate of the Society, who has\nhad a long and varied experience in the investigation of \" spirit\nphotography.\" He observed a point which, though not at all con\nspicuous at first sight, is very evident when once attention has been\ndrawn to it,\u2014viz., that almost all the white lines or marks in the\nphotograph are doubled, the brightest or best-lighted lines being most\nso. The doubling is clear, for instance, in some photographs and\n\fDEc., 1895.] Spirit Photography. 171\ncandles standing on two tables, various parts of some chairs,\nsome of the handles of the drawers of a cabinet, and finally\nin the books and mouldings of the book-shelves.* In each case,\nthere is a faint image to the right side of and slightly lower\ndown than the bright image of the same object. This shows that\nthe camera must have been moved slightly during the exposure,\nas DO movement of the furniture could have produced such complete\nuniformity of the double appearance. Since one set of images is\nmuch clearer than the other, the camera must have been moved either\nnear the beginning or near the end of the exposure. Miss Corbet,\nhowever, informs us that the camera was placed in the open doorway\nand partly outside it, and thinks it possible that she herself may have\nshaken it in passing out of the room. This also makes it possible that\nanother person passing by may have moved it slightly without coming\ninto the room at all.\nIt is important to ascertain whether or not the \"ghost\"\u2014\nthe figure in the chair\u2014has a double outline as well as the other\nobjects in the room, as, if so, it would prove that the figure had\nbeen in the chair during the whole of the exposure, and, there\nfore, could not be that of the person who moved the camera. Unfor\ntunately, it is altogether so faint, and its outline is so much blurred\nthat it is impossible to make certain of this point. So far, however,\nas there can be said to be any double outline, it clearly does not\ncorrespond with the double outline of the other objects. It is\npossible to trace more than one outline in the head and stock or\ncollar, but impossible to say that the one on the right is lower down\nthan the one on the left ; if anything, it is slightly higher up. Further,\nthere are two distinct images of the elbow, but one is resting on the\narm of the chair, while the other projects some way below it. This\nseems to prove conclusively that the figure\u2014unlike all the other\nobjects in the room\u2014moved during the exposure, and that the multi\nplication of its outlines was not due to the movement of the camera.\nThus the camera may have been moved by some one who came\ninto the room while the photograph was being taken, and Professor\nBarrett's experiments prove that the semi-transparency and whole\nappearance of the figure may have been caused by the person in\nquestion sitting in the chair for a short time, and moving about in it\nas he did so.\n* The doubling is not shown very satisfactorily in the reproduction, but is fairly\nclear in the photograph standing on the small table to the extreme right, also in\nanother photograph in a high stand on the large table and a caudle to the right of\nthis, and may be seen more faintly in the books.\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Dreams.\nThe following case was sent to us by Mrs. Browne, of Bidston,\nAlleyn Road, West Dulwich.\nThe first narrative is extracted from an account privately printed a\nfew months after the events occurred.\nHaylett House, Surbiton, Jtdy, 1891.\nNewbray Hall was drowned off Start Point, Devon, during the great\nstorm of March 9th, 1891, his vessel, the \" Marana,\" being one of the many\nwhich were lost at that spot.\nHe had had the offer of two or three vessels, including the \" Marana,\"\nand came homo on the 28th February, to consider what he should do, and\ndiscussed the matter at considerable length on Tuesday evening, the\n3rd March, with his father and Captain Byng, an old naval friend. The\ndeceased slept at home on Wednesday and Friday, and stated that he would\nreturn to dinner on the Saturday, but he did not do so, and on Monday\nmorning his mother received a letter from him stating that he had sailed the\nprevious day in the \" Marana.\"\nOn Monday evening the storm took place, and on the Tuesday or\nWednesday night following, Miss Annie Hall, aged 27, the sister of the\ndeceased, dreamt that she saw her brother on a raft apparently composed of\nloose planks of wood, and ho appeared to be swimming. On the same\nor subsequent nights she had other dreams, in which she saw her brother\nlying in a room, but she was unable to say whether alive or dead. This all\ntook place before any news had been received of the loss of the \" Marana,\"\nand Miss Hall related her dreams immediately to Mrs. Syms, aged 40, who\nhad lived with the family as cook for about ten years. On Friday night a\ntelegram was received at Surbiton from the owners stating that the\n\"Marana\" had been wrecked, and on the Saturday morning Mr. Wood,\nwho was in the employ of the deceased's father, went down to Devonshire,\nand having ascertained that the body of the deceased had been recovered,\nand was lying in a house at Prawle, South Devon, he identified it and\nbrought it to Brookwood for burial.\nMatters remained in this position until the 16th June, when Mrs. Hall\nand her daughter went to the house at Prawle in which the body had been\nplaced, and Miss Hall at once positively identified the room as the one she\nhad seen in her dreams. Upon going to the spot also where the body had\nbeen found, a large number of railway sleepers were observed, which had\nbeen washed up from the wreck, and, as can be seen from a photograph,\nhave very much the appearance of a raft such as that described in the\nfirst dream.\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

It was about 4 '30 when I went into the market place to take the\nomnibus home. When I was standing waiting, a fearful gust of wind and\nsnow seemed to blow, especially round me. ,\u2014that was about the time the ship\nstruck,\u2014though the storm was getting very bad indeed. Newbray and I\nwere so devoted that I felt he was in some awful trouble. When I got home\nI gave up a concert I was going to, as I felt so ill and anxious. 1 didn't\ndream anything on the Monday, but on Tuesday I dreamt that I saw him on\na raft made up of loose planks of wood, and he appeared to be swimming.\nOn the same and following nights I had other dreams, and in one particular\none I saw him lying on the floor in a room with a slanting roof ; he looked\nvery still and white, but I couldn't tell if he were alive or dead. I could tell\nthe room was m the country somewhere, as I could see it was whitewashed\nand they had red flowers in the windows. I told our old cook, Mrs. Syms,\nwho had then been with us ten years, when she came up with my tea.\nOn Friday we got a telegram to say the \" Marana \" was wrecked. On\nJune 16th mother and I went to the house at Prawle where they had\ntaken his poor body. As soon as I got in I went upstairs to the room,\nas I knew it at once from my dream, and pointed out to mother the spot\nwhere he lay. The woman in the house couldn't understand it, as I had\nnever been there. My dream was accurate in every detail, even to the\nlow long windows, and the most wonderful thing was that I dreamt the\ndream the night he was taken to the cottage. His body was found\namongst railway sleepers that looked just the same as I saw them in my\nfirst dream, so in every respect my dreams represented accurately the events\nwhich took place in connection with my brother's death. I had never been\nto South Devon and never heard of Prawle. He was 25 and I 27 when he\ndied. We were most devoted.\nANNIE HALL.\nThe following note was written by the servant to whom Miss Hall\nrelated her dreams at the time : \u2014\nBlenheim Lodge, Surbiton.\nMiss Hall told me about her dreams when I took her bedroom tea in\nbefore she was up.\nMARY SYMS.\n\fDEO., 1895.] .

O. HALL.\nMiss Hall writes further :\u2014\nBlenheim Lodge, Surbiton, July 12th, 1895.\nThe dreams were of conditions actually existing, just as it was happening\nto my brother Newbray, not prophetic.

Dream.\nThe following is a case which was noted at the time, before it was\nknown to be veridical.\nIt was received by Mr. Barkworth, who writes concerning it : \u2014\nWest Hatch, Chigwell, Essex, August 24th, [1895.]\nIt has been often made a subject of reproach by persons who distrust the\nS.P.R. that the evidence we obtain is seldom, if ever, supported by written\nrecords demonstrably made before the dream or the hallucination had been\nverified by subsequently ascertained facts. Indeed, a Mr. Taylor Innes,\nwriting in the Ntneteenth Century some years ago, went so far, if I\nremember rightly, as to assert that no such case could be produced up to\nthe time he wrote. It must certainly be admitted that in provokingly\nnumerous instances it is found that the alleged letter or diary has been\ndestroyed.\nThe following experience of the Rev. E. K. Elliott, Rector of Worthing,\nwho was formerly in the navy, and who made the entry in his diary as quoted\nwhen he was cruising in the Atlantic out of reach of post or telegraph, will\ntherefore be found of interest.

Ae Ps Dream.\nThe following case comes to us through the American branch of\nthe S.P.R. :\u2014\nSatank, Colorado, January 2nd, 1894.\nWe live on a farm ten miles from Glenwood Springs. At Glenwood\nSprings a Mrs. Walz, whom my wife has known for some years, lives with\nher husband. She was the mother of two children, one an infant. This\nMrs. Walz, our daughter (who is married and lives near us\u2014a mile away)\nand a Mrs. Zimmermann have been, from the time of their first acquaint\nance, intimate friends. Mrs. Zimmermann lives four miles from us, fourteen\nmiles from Glenwood Springs.\nMy wife had not seen Mrs. Walz for months, had not heard anything\nabout her for some time, and did not know of any sickness in her family.\nOn Sunday morning, December 17th, while my wife was dressing, and\nbefore she had seen or spoken to any one but me, she told me of a dream\nshe had had in the night. She dreamed that Mrs. Walz's baby was dead,\nand that she was at their house. She wished to do certain work that\nneeded to be done in the house, but she was not dressed. While she was\nstruggling vainly to get her clothes on, Mrs. Zimmermann came into the\ndream, doing this work.\nIt was about six o'clock when my wife told me this. About ten o'clock\nour daughter came in and told us that she and her husband had been to\nGlenwood Springs the day before to attend the funeral of Madgie Walz's\nbaby, and that Hattie Zimmermann was there doing the work which has to be\ndone on such occasions.\nOur son was out that night and heard of the death of the child ; but he\ndid not return till one o'clock\u2014long after we were in bed\u2014and he was not\nup, nor had he spoken to his mother, when she told me the dream. She\nheard him come in, and she thinks the dream came after that.\nSTEPHEN PEEBLES.\nMrs. Peebles writes :\u2014\nMy husband has read the above to me. My dream was as he has told it,\nand my recollection of the circumstances connected with my telling it to\nhim and its verification is as he. has given them. D I^ PEEBLES\nMr. F. M. Peebles, son of the percipient, writes :\u2014\n[Satank. Colorado, January 2nd, 1894.]\nI was away from home on that evening of December 16th, and was told of\nthe death of the child, which formed the subject of my mother's dream. I\nthink this was about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, but I did not return\nhome until after midnight, and did not speak to my mother about what I\nhad heard until near noon the next day. FRANK M PEEBLES\nL. 995. An P\u00bb Auditory.\nThe next case was received from Mrs. 0. R. Griffing, an\nAssociate member of the American branch of the S.P.R., who is\n\fDEc., 1895.] Cases. 177\nwell-known to Dr. Hodgson. She made the following note of what\nshe had heard from the percipient, her daughter-in-law, before they\nknew that it had any correspondence with the actual facts :\u2014\nBox 14, White Plains, New York, Jime 13tt, 1891.\nJust now I am feeling much worried about my son Horace, who is\naway. My sister, who has many times made correct predictions, wrote me\nthat she saw Horace very ill, and last evening my daughter in-law, after she\nwent to her room, heard Horace, as she supposed, enter the casement\nkitchen ; she heard him rock in his favourite large chair and move about.\nThis morning, when I went down to breakfast, she said, \" Horace came,\ndidn't he ? \" She was so sure that he came that she had more coffee made\nfor him. Just now I am the only one who drinks coffee. She thought she\nheard me early this morning ask him how he was feeling. AIl this may nob\nbe premonitory, but it worries me. JANE R GRIFFING.\nHer son actually returned home the next day, and Mrs. Griffing\nwrote shortly after :\u2014\n[June 28th, 1891.]\nThe morning of June 13th, when I went down to breakfast, my daughter-\nin-law remarked carelessly, \" Horace came last night, didn't he ? \" \"No,\"\nI said, \" He did not come.\" \" But 1 heard him come,\" she exclaimed, in a\nsurprised tone. \" Are you sure he isn't here ? \" I answered that I was\nsure. \" But,\" she persisted, \"did you look into the room ? I am sure I\nheard him.\" It was difficult to convince her that he was not somewhere\nabout. He had been away only a few days, was well, as far as we knew, and\nwe had no reason to be anxious about him. The next day he returned and\ntold me that he came very near coming the evening before, but after talking\nit over with Charley he decided to wait until the next day. They both told\nme of their discussing it about eight o'clock. JANE R GRIPPING\nThe percipient describes her impression as follows :\u2014\nDuring the evening of June 12th, about eight o'clock, I went to my\nroom. Some time before nine, I heard my brother-in-law, Horace, come to\nthe basement-kitchen door; finding it locked he went to a window, raised\nit and stepped in. I heard him strike a match, move about the room, and\nsit down in a large rocking chair. I was so absolutely sure that it was\nHorace that I did not go down to see who it was, or speak to my mother-in-\nlaw about it. I supposed she knew that Horace was there. The reason I was\nso sure that it was Horace instead of anyone else was that my other\nbrother-in-law was in the house, my husband would not come until the next\nday, and all the movements I heard were exactly like Horace's habits when\nhe had been out and came in by the basement, especially his sitting and\nrocking in that particular chair. PHEBE L GRIPPING.\nMr. C. L. Griffing and his brother give the following account of\nwhat they were doing at the time :\u2014\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEc., 1895.\nThe evening of June 12th, ray brother Horace and I were together for an\nhour or so before nine o'clock. It must have been about eight when we were\ndiscussing the question of his returning to White Plains that night, or\nwaiting until the next day and [going] up with me. He was quite inclined at\nfirst to go by a late train that evening but decided to wait until the next day.\nCHAS. L. GRIFFING.\nMy brother's account of the conversation between us in regard to my\nreturning home during the evening of June 12th is correct. It could not\nhave been far from eight o'clock, as we were not together until after seven,\nand separated before nine. H M GRIFFINO.\nIn answer to Dr. Hodgson's further enquiries, Mrs. Griffing\nBox 14, White Plains, New York, April 1st, [1892.]\nIn reply to your enquiry, at the time of the telepathic incident of June\n12th, it was entirely uncertain when Horace would return ; he might come at\nany time and might not for weeks. He was in the City for a special purpose\nand did not know what the result would be. I was not expecting him at that\ntime, as it was too soon for him to know what his plans would be, and he\nreturned only for two or three days. I was not in the least anxious about\nhim, as he was well and in no trouble of any kind.\nJANE R. GRIFFING.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nEUSAPIA PALADINO.\nThe following letter has been received by Mr. Myers from\nProfessor Richet.\nMON CHER MYERS,\u2014Me permettrez vous quelques observations a propos\ndes faits relatifs k Eusapia, qui out 6t6 notes a Cambridge ? II me parait en\neffet qu'il y a quelque inte'ret a ne pas laisser 1'opinion publique s'egarer et a\nramener les faits a leur juste proportion. Je n'ai pas voulu re'pondre tout\nde suite, precisement pour me dormer le temps de la reflexion.\nOr, si 1'on re'duit les choses a leur veritable signification, on voit qu'il n'y\na pas eu re'ellement de fait nouveau decouvert a Cambridge. En effet,\ncomme le rappelait le professeur Sidgwick, j'avais decrit depuis longtemps\nles procedes que pouvait employer ou meme qu'employait Eusapia. Ce\nn'etait pas nouveau ; car M. Torelli, dans le Corriere della sera, les avait deja\nindique's avant moi. J. Ochorowicz les a depuis signales a Varsovie. Done\nil n'y a eu rien d'imprevu dans la soi-disant substitution des mains.\nDe meme pour la substitution des pieds. II est evident que nous savions\ntous que la tenue des pieds par nos pieds, dechausse's ou non, est parfaite-\nment illusoire, et c'est pour cela, qu'apres avoir essaye quantity d'appareils\n\fDEc., 1895.] Correspondence. 179\nelectriques divers, nous eumes, en de'sespoir de cause, recours au procede'\nsimple, mais peu agreable, qui consiste a se mettre sous la table et a tenir\navec ses mains les deux pieds d'Eusapia.\nJe ne vois done pas que les observations de M. Hodgson aient apporte un\nelement nouveau dans la question, puisque toutes ces fraudes, ou apparences\nde fraudes, avaient e'te' bel et bien constate'es, analyse'es, et decrites.\nCe qu'il y a de nouveau, dit-on, c'est que ces fraudes ont ete plus\naccentuees que nous 1'avions supposed Mais nullement, et nous les avions\ntoujours suppose'es au maximum, car, du moment qu'une experience quel-\nconque pouvait etre expliquee par une fraude, meme invraisemblable, et que\ntoutes les precautions n'avaient pas ete prises pour TeViter, nous ne donnions\na cette experience aucune valeur. Nous nous sommes toujours places dans\ncette hypothese que la premiere explication a donner, c'est la fraude, et ce\nn'est qu'apres avoir admis dans tel ou tel cas la fraude cornme impossible,\net absolument impossible, que nous admettions le caractere ve'ridique de\nI'expe'rience.\nDegageons done les faits de tous details. En somme que reste-t-il?\nDeux propositions qui ne me paraissent pas contestables. A Cambridge\nEusapia, pendant une serie de seances a fraude avec ses procedes connus.\nVoila la premiere conclusion. Et voici la seconde. En mettant Ensapia\ndans rimpossibilitt de frauder, pendant cette meme serie d'experiences de\nCambridge, Eusapia n'a pas pu produire un seul phenomene vrai.\nJe crois que c'est tout, et qu'il n'y a pas davantage.\nEh bien ! II me parait qu'il est te'me'raire de conclure que tous les\nphtSnomenes produits ou presumes produits par Eusapia sont faux. C'est\nune conclusion qui de'passe singulierement les premisses. On pourrait\necrire bien des pages la-dessus ; mais je pense que 1'expe'rimentation vaut\nmieux que la discussion. Je me contente done de faire remarquer :\n1<> que ces soi-disant fraudes ne s'appliquent (ju'a un seul phe'nomene,\net que pour quantite d'autres faits,\u2014mouvements de la table, lumieres,\nInvitations, ecriture directe,\u2014aucune explication n'a pu etre donne'e. Meme\nil parait prouve que, malgre toute la perspicacite' de M. Hodgson, (je ne\nveux pas parler de la notre) on n'a jamais pu d^celer le moindre instrument\net le plus petit appareil lui servant k aider ses manifestations.\n2\u00b0 que, dans toutes nos experiences ante'rieures, nous e'tions parfaitement\navertis de la possibilite' d'une fraude, et que meme nous en connaissions\nexactement la nature, de sorte que les revelations de M. Hodgson ne nous\nont absolument rien revile.\n3\u00b0 que certaines experiences anterieures ont ete de telle nature que nous\nles avons, vous et moi, et O. Lodge, regardees comme definitives, et ne\ndevant pas etre detruites par tout ce que nous pourrions decouvrir plus tard.\n4\u00b0 que souvent, sous des influences morales et psychologiques dont la\nnature nous echappe, pendant un tres long temps Eusapia est incapable de\npouvoir exercer une action vrai quelconque, et que peut-ctre, a Cambridge,\nelle s'est trouvee dans ces conditions.\n5\u00b0 que, dans des experiences faites en France, peu de temps apres celles\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEO., 1895.\nde Cambridge, des savants d'intelligence certaine et d'honorabilit6 irreproch-\nable ont eu des phe'nomenes tres nets qui ne leur ont pas laisse le droit de\ndouter.\n6\u00b0 que, malgre' les apparences qui sont en effet souvent contre Eusapia,\nje ne suis fixe' en aucune maniere sur ce que j'ai appeltS jusque ici fraude, et\nqu'il est tres possible, que dans 1'etat de trance, ou dans les <;tats voisins, la\npsychologic d'un medium soit tres differente de la notre.\nTous ces points pourraient etre discutes longuenient ; mais j'ai hate de\nconclure, et voici ma conclusion ; c'est qu'il faut rtserver son jitgement.\nC'est ce que j'avais fait apres les experiences de Milan ; c'est ce que\nj'avais fait apres les experiences de Rome ; c'est ce que j'avais fait aussi\napres les experiences de 1'ile Roubaud, qui vous avaient Dependant paru si\ndecisives, ainsi qu'a O. Lodge. Je n'avais rien voulu publier ; car, pour\netre certain dans cet ordre de faits inexplicables et absurdes, il faut etre mille\nfois certain ; et je n'ai pu jamais arriver a cette certitude absolue qui me\nparait ne'cessaire.\nMais, de meme que nous avions suspendu notre jugement, quand il\ns'agissait d'une preuve positive, de meme il me parait sage et equitable de le\nsuspendre aujourd'hui, quand il s'agit de tout nier.\nSupposons que nous soyions des juges, pe'ne'tres de la dignite de notre\nmission et de la responsabilite qui pese sur nous. Oserions nous accuser ?\nNon, et cent fois non. Nous demanderions un supplement d'informations,\net une enquete nouvelle, plus longue, plus approfondie. Or des savants qui\ncherchent la verite sont vraiment des j ugea.\nJ'en conclus qu'il n'y a encore rien de demontre, ni dans un sens, ni dans\n1'autre, et qu'il faut courageusement poursuivre la recherche ; et experi\nmenter encore.

The Schedule of Enquiry which had been issued through\nthe liberality of the Marquis of Bute in 1893-4 had for various\nreasons failed to elicit much information, except as to the widespread\nrecognition of the difficulties of an enquiry into a subject upon which,\n'by heredity, tradition, and religious opinion, the Highlanders were\nnaturally reticent.\nIn 1894, by request of the Council, \" Miss X.\" had undertaken to\nvisit personally such parts of the Highlands as seemed to open a\npromising field for investigation. The task had proved considerably\nmore laborious than she had expected, as it involved, not only\n\u2022difficult travelling into unfrequented districts, but a great amount of\nwriting and correspondence. It was, however, an enquiry in which,\npersonally, she felt a very special interest, and she was glad to emulate\nin some degree the zeal and industry of which, in the cause of the\nSociety, Mrs. Sidgwick and Mr. Myers had for so many years set so\neminent an example. (Applause.)\nIn presenting a second ad interim report, \" Miss X.\" desired, in the\nfirst place, to emphasize the fact that a second visit to the Highlands,\nwhich had taken her to districts even more remote than before,\nhad tended to establish the preliminary deductions which she had\npresented to the Society a year ago. The evidence had increased in\nquantity, but had not changed in kind. The special faculty of the\nHighland Seer seemed to be that of premonition. Other occult gifts\nalleged to exist among Seers elsewhere, were not to be found among\nHighlanders. She had found no trace of the faculty of retrocognition\nby psychometry or other methods ; no traditions of supernormal\nhealing powers, except in the case of \"The Evil Eye\"; no belief in\nanything at all resembling \" Spirit Controls\"; no \" physical pheno\nmena,\" except what seem to be remains of the commonly recognised\nfolk-lore story of the stone-throwing ghost. Some stories of levitation\nwhich she had heard in one district of the far north lacked evidence,\u2014\nas yet. There were, moreover, no instances to which the people seemed\nto attach importance of persistent hauntings, though many had reached\nher of the reported return of some recently deceased person for a\npurpose, which purpose accomplished, the apparition was seen no more.\nMany of the stories might be fairly explained by the hypothesis of\nThought-Transference, and the Highlanders themselves seemed aware of\nits possibilities, as for example, in cases, of which she had heard many,\nwhere a doctor, or priest, or minister, was aware, in advance, of the\napproach of a summons to the sick. She had found, moreover, few traces\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 189K.\nof the use of any empirical methods, and the general belief seemed to be\nstrongly in favour of spontaneous phenomena, dependent, \" Miss X.\"\nwas inclined to believe, mainly on the vividness of the Highlander's\nfaculty of visualisation. The phenomena seemed to be externalised\nalmost entirely in terms of sight, generally of pictures, a few stories\nbeing current of supernormal sounds, or of verbal communications.\nIndeed where such communications were alleged, it was very difficult\nto get at their nature, as there was a specially strong feeling among\nthe Highlanders as to disclosing a message of this sort. \" Miss X.\"\nwas able, however, to quote one well-authenticated case in which a girl\nhad been visited by the shade of a lover who had been drowned at sea,\nand whose effects, including a present for herself, had been appro\npriated by one of his companions. She received instructions as to its\nnature and whereabouts, and it was ultimately recovered.\n\" Miss X.,\" while acknowledging to the utmost the importance of\nobtaining evidence as exact as possible, and feeling strongly that the\ntestimony of independent witnesses should be secured at any cost of\ntime and trouble, had nevertheless not rejected every case in which\nsuch evidence was not forthcoming. There were many instances in\nwhich the internal evidence was promising, and which she had received\non the authority of trustworthy persons, which she could not but feel\nto be useful and valuable from their analogies or inherent sugges-\ntiveness, though they might be imperfect in the matter of names and\ndates and outside testimony.\nThe question of evidence was, naturally, the laborious and tedious,\npart of the enquiry, as it was its ultimate object. \" Miss X.\" had\nbeen happy in securing help and sympathy in her work among all\nclasses in the Highlands, and by one means or another had never been\nrefused a first-hand narrative from any Seer she had been fortunate\nenough to discover. The real difficulty began with the attempt to\nsubstantiate that narrative !

At the same time\" Miss X.\"\ncould not but feel some degree of confidence in the narratives of a\npeople, not only simple and truthful in character aud habit, but whose\ntemptation in the present instance, \u2014superstition apart\u2014would be to\nminimise, rather than exaggerate, the supernormal in their experiences,\nthe gift being considered, as a rule, not one to be boasted of.\n\fJAN., 1896.] General Meeting. 185\n\" Miss X.\" believed that not the least important part of her work\nthis year had been the importation of others into the enquiry. She\nhad lost no opportunity of interesting, wherever possible, all educated\nresidents in the Islands and Highlands with whom she had been brought\nin contact, feeling that their relation with the peasantry and the con\ntinuity of their life among them would do more to achieve the purposes\nof the investigation than any unaided efforts of her own. She had\nreceived everywhere the utmost kindness, courtesy and hospitality,\nand she reflected with the greatest satisfaction that in most of the\nplaces she had visited she had left behind some interested enquirer^\nstill working for the good of Psychical Research.\nIt was needless to say that to know the Highlander one must seek\nhim on his native heath. The average Gillie of the Englishman's\nshooting-box is no more representative of the uncontaminated Gael\nthan is the foreign waiter at a fashionable hotel a genuine type of the\nGerman or the Swiss. She had, therefore, sought out the most remote\nspots accessible, avoiding the tourist and everything adapted to his\nuse. She had gleaned her information from the fisher-man in his\nherring-boat, and the travelling \" merchant \" in his gig, in the black\nsmith's forge, and the manse kitchen ; she had received help and\nhospitality from the Roman priest and the Presbyterian minister,\nfrom the laird, the police, and the poor-house official.\n\"Miss X.\" found that the natives differentiated at least three kinds\nof Second-Sight, the Gaelic names for which might be rendered as (1)\nSecond-Sight (proper), (2) Sight by \"wish,\" and (3) Sight by \"vision,\"\nor, as we should perhaps say\u2014(1) visualised clairvoyance or premonition,\n(2) experimental clairvoyance, and (3) symbolic vision; and she pro\nceeded to give examples of each of the three kinds. A large proportion\nof the cases which had come under her notice were concerned with\nprophecies, direct or indirect, of death, and in many instances lost some\nthing of their significance when the local colour was lacking, or the local\nallusions imperfectly understood. Many of the prophecies, for example,\nbore upon the difficulty of procuring wood for a coffin in islands where\ntrees are unknown, or the necessary labour difficult to obtain where\n\u2022craftsmen were few.\nMR. F. W. H. MYERS asked, in reference to a story quoted by \" Miss\nX.\", in which an effort had been vainly made to avert the fulfilment of\na prediction, whether she had met with many cases where such efforts\nhad been made in vain.\n\" Miss X.\" replied that other cases had reached her, generally of\neffort on the part of some one who had a grudge against the Seer, and\nshe believed that such efforts had invariably failed.\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1896.\nMR. MYERS also enquired whether \" Miss X.\" had discovered by\npopular talk, or the possible jealousy of a brother Seer, whether Seers\noften or ever made predictions which were not fulfilled.\n\" Miss X.\" replied that she had met with, and carefully noted,\ncertain cases in which the predictions were as yet unfulfilled, but very\nfew in which they had been falsified. The Seers for the most part\nwere hard-working folk, to whom such premonitions occurred spon\ntaneously, often at wide intervals. She had met with but one Seer\nwho might be described as \" professional.\" Not, of course, that he\ndegraded his gift by receiving money for its use, but that he, in some\ndegree, professed to have it at command. His powers, however, were\nnot greatly esteemed by those best acquainted with his character.\nA Highland lady endorsed \" Miss X.'s \" conclusions from her\npersonal acquaintance with the subject, and asked whether she had\never found such Seers as had met with an apparition willing to repeat\nthe message they had received.\n\"Miss X.\" answered that in most cases she found that they refused\nto tell any one what they had heard, believing such communication to\nbe unlucky.\nDR. WALLACE said that he had followed \" Miss X.\" in lona, and\nhad communicated to a native his speculation as to the success of her\ninquiry in that island. The reply had been that she very likely had\nsucceeded, as \" they were as good liars in that island as in any\nother.\"\n\" Miss X.\" replied that she thought that, owing to their contamina\ntion by English and Lowland tourists, they were probably better than\nin any other !\nTHE REV. 0. LACH-SZYEMA asked whether the intimations came\nthrough sight or hearing.\n\" Miss X.\" said that they appeared to be almost entirely visual,\nbut auditory cases were occasionally reported.\nDR. KINGSTON asked whether there was any evidence of the\nsupposed communication of visions through personal contact with the\nSeer.\n\" Miss X.\" replied that she was not aware of any authenticated\ncase of the kind.\nPROFESSOR SIDGWICK cordially thanked \" Miss X.\" for her work,\nand for her interesting report upon its latest development.\nME.

W. Dobbie, of Gawler Place,\nAdelaide, whose experiments in the subject of clairvoyance are familiar\nto readers of the Proceedings and Journal. The operator was Mr.\nR. S. Rogers, M.D., of Finders-street, Adelaide, now an Associate of\nthe Society. We quote the newspaper account sent by Mr, Dobbie.\nFrom The Advertiser.\nAdelaide, April 29th, 1895.\nA doctor in this city who has for some time made a study of hypnotism,\nand has carried out many successful experiments, resolved to operate on one\nof his patients who was suffering from tumour in the breast, provided he\ncould gain her consent. The lady operated upon had been several times\nhypnotised by the doctor, who had proved that whilst under the influence\nshe was quite insensible to pain. Even after having needles thrust into her\narm, she suffered no pain when told that she was not to feel any. Having\nobtained the consent of the patient and her husband to the operation being\nperformed under hypnotic influence, Sunday afternoon was fixed for the\nexperiment. Before proceeding further, it may be mentioned that the\npatient is of a very nervous disposion, and as it was feared that this fact\nmight to some extent interfere with the success of the experiment, post-\nhypnotic suggestion was resorted to in order to remove this obstacle. The\npatient, when under hypnotic influence earlier in the week, was told that\nwhen she entered the operating-room she would see all the surgical instruments\nto be used in the operation laid out on the table, but she was not to notice\nthese or to be made nervous by the presence of strangers, but to take her\nplace on the operating table as soon as she entered the room. She came\ninto the room without showing the slightest sign of nervousness, advanced\nto the operating table, and took up a position on it, apparently quite un\nconcerned. She was then ordered to go to sleep for three-quarters of an\nhour, and to feel no pain. Prior to commencing the use of the knife, the\ndoctor repeatedly told the patient that she was to feel no pain. \"No pain,\nabsolutely no pain,\" were the words repeatedly used to the patient, who lay\nin a tranquil sleep with a smile on her face. The operation was speedily\nperformed, the tumour removed, and the cut sewn up with several stitches,\nthe patient to all appearance suffering \"absolutely no pain.\" After the\noperation had been performed, our representative had a conversation with\nthe lady, who assured him that she felt no pain while under the operation,\nand was also absolutely free from pain then, which could readily be believed\nwhen one looked at her smiling face and heard her merry laugh, as she\nspoke of her absolute ignorance of anything having happened to hurt her, so\nfar as her feelings would allow her to judge. The fact of her suffering no\npain after the operation is due, the doctor states, to post-hypnotic suggestion,\nas he told her while under the influence that she was to feel no pain during\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

This is the first operation of this nature per\nformed in Adelaide, and that it was eminently successful all who witnessed\nit admitted.\nMr. Dobbie writes in reference to the above account :\u2014\nAdelaide, May 8th, 1895.\nI enclose a clipping from one of our leading papers which gives a correct\naccount of what took place. I was present during the whole of the operation,\nwhich took place on the Sunday afternoon at 3.15 p.m., and on Tuesday morn\ning, at 11 o'clock, I went with the doctor to the lady's house and saw him take\nthe stitches out, the wound having healed with unusual speed. The lady in\nformed me that she had suffered no pain from first to last. Whilst the doctor\nwas taking the stitches out, I noticed that the lady seemed to be in pain, and\non asking her if such was the case, she said \"yes.\" I then suggested to Dr.\nRogers to make a pass or two over the wound, and tell her that she would feel\nno further pain during the removal of the stitches and during final healing.\nHe did so without putting the lady to sleep, and the result was perfect ease\nto the patient.\nA. \\V. DOBBIE.\nP.S.\u2014I have just telephoned to Dr. Rogers, asking him how the lady was\nprogressing, and his reply is that the case has been all that could be desired ;\nin fact, he has not thought it necessary to visit her this week.\nCASES.\nG. 250. Dream.\nThe following case was sent to us from Brazil by Professor A.\nAlexander. We print his translations of the original documents, also\nsent. He informs us that the incident is \" of a type rather frequent\namong Brazilian Catholics,\" and says :\u2014\nJuly 23rd, 1895.\nIt occurred at Barbacena in Minas Gernes. The family in which it\noccurred is well known to me, and I have no doubt that the statements\nfurnished to me by them are quite worthy of credence. Donna Guilhermina\nNery has signed the deposition drawn up by me in the usual way. She is a\nmiddle-aged lady of a rather nervous temperament, and since the fact\nnarrated, she has had a non-coincidental visual and tactile hallucination,\nfollowing shortly after the death of a favourite son.\nIt will be observed that the incident of the votive candle was one\nvery likely to be introduced into a dream under the circumstances\ndescribed, but there seems no antecedent probability that Donna Nery\nshould have dreamt of the exact place where the candle was to be\nfound and of its having been already partly burnt.\n\fJAN., 1896.] Cases. 189\nHer account is as follows :\u2014\nBarbacena, March 26th, 1895.\nIn January, 1894, the decease occurred of Fe'licite' G. , a young Belgian\nlady, who was married to a nephew of mine. After the death of his wife,\nthe latter came to our house at Barbacena, bringing with him much luggage\nbelonging to the deceased, and he stayed here with hia children for some days.\nSome two months afterwards\u2014I have no means of ascertaining the exact\ndate\u2014I went to a soiree and returned home about 2 o'clock in the morning,\nhaving passed some pleasant hours in which all thoughts of sadness were\ntemporarily swept from my memory. On that very night, however, I had a\nvivid dream of Felicite'. It seemed to me that she entered the room where\nI really lay asleep, and, sitting down on the bedside, asked me, as a favour,\nto look into an old tin box under the staircase for a certain wax candle,\nwhich had been already lighted, and which she had promised to Our Lady.\nOn my consenting to do so, she took leave of me, saying, \" At6 o outro\nmundo (Till the other world).\"* I awoke from the dream much impressed.\nIt was still dark, but I could no longer sleep.\nOn that day, the others having gone out, I called a servant and ordered\nher to search in the tin box, which had, in fact, been placed under the stair\ncase, and which had belonged to Felicite. No one had opened the box\nbefore. It was full of old clothes and cuttings, among which it was by no\nmeans probable that we should find a wax candle. The servant turned over\nthese clothes, at first without result, and I was already beginning to think\nthat my dream was of no importance, when, on straightening out the\nclothes so that the box might be closed, I saw the end of a candle, which I\nat once ordered her to take out. It was of wax\u2014of the kind used for\npromises [to saints]\u2014and, what was a still more singular coincidence, it had\nalready been lighted.\nWe delivered the candle to Monsenhor Jos6 Augusto, of Barbacena, in\nperformance of my niece's pious vow thus curiously revealed in a dream.\n(Signed) GUILHEEMINA NEBY.\nSenhor Nery writes :\u2014\nBarbacena, March 26th, 1895.\nI recollect that, on the occasion, my wife told me of the dream, much\nimpressed by it. It is exactly what is written.\n(Signed) DOMINGOS NEEY.\nProfessor Alexander adds :\u2014\nAt my request, Catharina, the servant referred to in the above account,\nwas called to be examined. I found that she was a mere child. On being\nquestioned, she confirmed the narrative of her mistress, and recollected the\ncircumstance of finding the wax candle in the tin box.\nJose', a black boy, declared that he carried the candle to Monsenhor Jose'\nAugusto, who told him to give it to the sacristan.\nA.

Thought-transference.\nOur readers may remember a case of apparent thought-transference\noccurring during a seance with the \" medium \" Williams, an account of\nwhich was given by the Rev. 'W. S. Grignon in a letter printed in the\nJournal for last October.\nThe following is a somewhat similar case experienced by Mr.\nGrignon, the account being based on notes taken at the time.\nMr. Grignon writes to Mr. Myers :\u2014\nEssendon, Hatfield, Herts. November Wth, 1895.\n[I] send you an early experience of mine with the then well-known\nmediums\u2014the Marshalls. It seems to indicate, as the other did, the sudden\nflashing out of something genuinely supernormal in the midst of much that\nwas very worthless. My brother-in-law and I, at some time early in the\nseventies, resolved to have a se'ance with them, got their address\u2014some\nwhere near Maida Hill\u2014from a directory, called one afternoon without having\nmade an appointment, and without giving our names were at once ushered\nin to Mrs. Marshall, senior, and her daughter-in-law, who acted as medium on\nthis occasion. No other person was present. We were both entire strangers\nto them, and I had carefully avoided clerical costume. Communication*\nwere by raps and the alphabet, results eminently unsatisfactory. There was\nnothing to prove fraud, much to suggest it. When a spirit professing to be\nmy mother refused absolutely to give her surname, married or maiden,\nobviously fished for her Christian name, and had nothing to say to me except,\n\"Try to have faith,\" naturally I had less faith than before. All communica\ntions were scrappy and trivial, all might have proceeded from the medium.\nSuddenly, in the midst of some trashy talk, came a different kind of rap.\nMrs. M., jun. : \"Is this another spirit?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you wish to\nspeak with this gentleman?\" (pointing to me). \"Yes.\" Then I, \"Will\nyou give your name ?'\" \"Emma Scott.\" \"I never knew any one of that\nname. Did I ever see you?\" \"No, I saw you.\" \"How long ago?\"\n\"23 years.\" \"Where?\" \"In London.\" \"London is a large place.\nWhere in London ?\" \"Brook-street.\" \" Can you give me the name of the\nperson in whose house you saw me ? \" \"Varsitt.\" This was spelled out with\nmuch effort and was apparently incomplete. The medium here suggested\nthat I should write down several names, including that of my friend in Brook-\nstreet, and said that raps would come when the right name was written.\nKnowing that mediums were said to judge when to rap by watching the\nhand and eye of the writer, I placed myself so as to conceal both, chose\nmentally before beginning several names of equal length and wrote them\ndown slowly with mechanical precision. At the fifth name, \" Vansittart,\"\ncame a shower of raps. Only once in my life had I entered a house in\nBrook-street, Grosvenor-square, and that was when, just twenty-three years\nbefore, I spent two or three days with my friend, the late Augustus Arthur\nVansittart, in a house which with a considerable fortune had been left to him\nby his aunt then lately deceased. Dialogue resumed. ' ' Were you a servant\n\fJAN., 1896.] Cases. 191\nin the house?\" \"Not exactly.\" \" Can you tell me where I first became\nacquainted with this gentleman?\" The word \"Trinity \"was spelled out.\nThe medium, evidently taking it as a theological term, exclaimed, \" Oh,\ndon't say such things. We don't like them.\" (The spirits did, I believe,\nnow and then indulge in a little blasphemy.) I said, \"That will do. I\nunderstand,\" but explained nothing. In fact I had formed Vansittart's\nacquaintance when we were both scholars of Trinity College, Cambridge, and,\nI think, at the scholars' table. I wrote to him at once to ask if he\nremembered any Emma Scott in his house. He replied that he did not, but\nthat his housekeeper (he was living en gargon) engaged and dismissed the\nfemale servants without consulting him, so that it was a chance if he knew\ntheir names or their faces. Of course, also, the housekeeper might have had\nvisitors of her own. I can only add that the Marshalls had no conceivable\nreason for connecting me with either University ; still less, if possible, for\nassigning me to Cambridge and to Trinity College, and that during this part,\nat all events, of the seaiixe, neither of them asked any prying question, if\nindeed they did so at all. Old Mrs. Marshall was, I believe, the widow of a\nsmall tradesman at the east end of London, and neither she nor her\ndaughter-in-law seemed to have risen intellectually or socially above their\noriginal position. They were very unlikely to be familiar with the university\nway of using the names of colleges. Even had the medium guessed my\nprofession and antecedents, she would probably have tried \"Cambridge\nCollege \" or \" Oxford College,\" and so possibly felt her way on. I must say\nthat the directness of the simple \" Trinity \" did impress me a good deal.\nWM. S. GRIGNON.\nMr. Grignon writes later :\u2014\nNovember 23rd, 1895.\nIn sending you the case, I omitted to add that my account of it was based\npartly on my very distinct recollection of the occurrences, partly on the\nnotes, if they can be so-called, taken at the time, i.e., on the words of the\ncommunications taken down by me, letter by letter, as the alphabet was\nrepeated. These papers I brought away from the Marshalls' house, but\nafterwards, as I thought, destroyed. However, a few months ago they\u2014or\nsome of them\u2014turned up among some other papers connected with the\nsubject, and the fact that by them I could both test and refresh my memory\nwas one reason I had for sending the case.\nW.

Q g CAMPBELL\nThe following is Mr. K.'s letter to Mr. Campbell, describing the\nvision \u2022\u2014 November 12th, 1894.\nDEAR MR. CAMPBELL,\u2014One afternoon, at least two, if not three days\nprior to the bombardment of Alexandria,* during the last Egyptian war, the\ncrystal was \"charged \" and placed before a man who had not previously seen\none, nor had he any knowledge of its use. This was done with a view to\nascertaining whether he had \"the power of sight.\"\nThe subject was in no way suggested to him, but it was one he could not\nmisunderstand. After looking intently into the crystal for a short time, he\nbecame somewhat startled, took it up and carefully examined it, then asked\nhow what he saw had been inserted. Being asked what he saw, he described\na matter affecting his household\u2014recognising his wife, etc.\nWith this proof of his power, the subject was changed to that of the\nEgyptian war ; but no words were spoken by which he could form the\n\u2022slightest idea of what he might see next, nor could it in any other way be\nsuggested to him, as it affected the future only. Again looking intently into\nthe crystal, he described the (active) bombardment of Alexandria ; the fire at\nRao-en-tin palace, its surroundings ; battle of Tel-el-Kebir and large number\nof prisoners; march of the British troops to Cairo; imprisonment of Arabi;\u2014\ndescribing, in his own language, a lot of scenes, including allegorical details\nwhich were easily understood.\nI may add that the same man, turning over a portfolio of photographs\nquite recently, exclaimed, \"I should know that place\u2014I have seen it before\u2014\nyes, in the crystal.\" It was a view of Cairo, but he had never been there,\nnor, so far as he recollected, ever saw a picture of it before.\nMr. Campbell proceeds :\u2014\nWith regard to the \" charging \" of the crystal, I should say that this\nconsists in offering up a traditional incantation or prayer that the crystal\nmay show a vision of the particular events which it is desired to see. On\nreceipt of this letter, I wrote back asking whether the \" charging \" was done\n. silently, whether Mr. R. was likely to have transferred a particular picture in\nhis own mind to that of the seer, and one or two other questions. As the\n\" charging \" was done silently, nothing less than telepathy of possible\nsubliminal images will account for the visions, for the seer himself was an\nignorant man, whose astonishment at seeing the minarets at one point (as\nMr. R. told me in conversation) was extreme ; he had no idea what they\nwere, and was at loss how to describe them. He certainly could not have\nevolved such pictures of the war as he obtained from any personal knowledge.\nMr. R. himself does not consider the case one of thought-transference, for\nhe was greatly surprised at many of the events depicted, as for instance, the\ntaking prisoner of Arabi, whom he expected to be killed.\n* The bombardment of Alexandria took place in July, 1882.\n\fJAN., 1896.] Cases. 193\nMr. R. writes further :\u2014\nDecember 10ft, 1894.\nDEAR MB. CAMPBELL,\u2014I deferred replying to your former letter in the\nhope that I might induce the man referred to to verify what he saw. He\nadmits the accuracy of my statement, but is evidently afraid to sign any\ndocument. He was forbidden to have anything to do with the crystal, and it\nis quite evident he dare not disobey.\nIn reply to your queries, I may say I told the man nothing, nor had I in\nmy mind any idea of what he might see, and I am sure he had not. What I\ndesired or asked for was done silently. The first was more as a test, and his\namazement was when he saw his own wife in his own house. I may add that\nthere was something more\u2014a shadow of another person somewhat elevated\nbehind her (she had been married before), but as I thought this might\nfrighten him, I took the crystal from him and changed the subject to what I\nafterwards gave you the description of.\nL. 996. Thought-transference.\nThe following case, which comes to us through the American\nbranch of the Society, may be compared with Mrs. Monro's experience\nof hearing a bell ring when her friend was wishing to ring her bell (see\nJournal S.P.R. for November, p. 162), but is an instance of a more\ndefinitely experimental kind.\nThe agent, Mrs. Lee, writes :\u2014\nShrewsbury, Mass. December 7th, 1891.\nAn interesting experiment I tried last winter. A friend of sensitive\ntemperament occupied a room (in a foreign country) next my own. The\nconnecting door between the two was closed. The lady was writing (as she\nafterwards told me). Wishing to see her, I intended to go to her, but as I\nwas comfortably resting on the lounge, I met the recalcitrant disposition to-\nmove with the mental question, '' How long will we be slaves to matter,\ntime and space?\" Whereupon it occurred to me to exert a strong mental\neffort instead of a slight physical one. In about five minutes it proved\nsuccessful ! I heard steps approaching the door. To my summons in\nresponse to her rap, she opened the door, \" Did you call me ? I was under\nthe impression that you did, but was not sure I heard you.\" I explained.\nMy friend replied that she was conscious of me a moment or two before she\nput down her pen to come to me.\nMARY HOLLAND LEE.\nIn answer to Dr. Hodgson's request for a corroborative statement\nfrom the lady on whom the experiment was tried, Mrs. Lee wrote :\u2014\nAugust 22nd, 1893.\nThe answer to your letter I delayed until I heard from Miss S. I wrote\nto her to make a statement of the telepathic experiment between us when\nat Mentone, France. I enclose her letter.\n\f194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1896.\nThe letter enclosed was as follows :\u2014\nDEAR MRS. LEE, \u2014I do remember the time of which you speak, when we\nwere in Mentone, and you drew me to you by a little mental telepathy. I\nthink I was writing to E. D. in my room, which adjoined yours. Suddenly\nmy train of thought was broken into by a feeling that I must go to you. I\nfelt that you needed me for something, without stopping to think what that\nsomething might be. But I knew that some invisible power had hold of me,\ncalling me. I then stepped to your door, and asked you if you had spoken\nor if you wanted anything, and you immediately told me that it was but an\nexperiment on your part to prove the power of mind over matter. It was\ncertainly successful that time and has been at other times, when we have\nbeen separated by miles of distance.\n(Signed) E S , [full name given].\nNo details were given as to the other experiments referred to by\nMiss S., but a similar experiment tried by Mrs. Lee in the case of\nanother friend, Mrs. Chenoweth, was related by the latter in the\nMedico-Legal Journal, Vol. I., No. 3, June, 1893, as follows.\u2014\nA lady whom I shall call Mrs. L., my friend since my own girlhood, and,\nwith myself, a member of the American Branch of the London Society for\nPsychical Research, had a trifling experiment in telepathy with me in the\nmonth of August, 1892, which was so simple and successful that it seems\nworth telling.\nWe spent the summer in a charming New England village ; I living near\nthe top of a long hill, and she half way down, the houses of both facing\nupon the one broad avenue which makes the main street of the village.\nWe saw one another daily, but on the day in August above referred to,\nthe date of which is mislaid, we had passed hours together, and parted near\nsix o'clock in the afternoon, when I went home to tea, averring laughingly\nat parting that it could not be promised when I should come again, since we\ncould surely think of nothing more to say to one another for days.\nAt nine o'clock that evening I found my thoughts turning with strange\npersistence toward Mrs. L. It seemed to me that she was in need of me,\nand I felt impelled to go to her. In vain I argued that if it were a matter of\nimportance she would come to me, or send for me. The silent call continued.\nAfter the lapse of half-an-hour I turned to a friend, and asked if she felt\nable to walk down to Mrs. L.'s with me, reluctantly asking, as she was\nsuffering somewhat from a lame foot. She was incredulous, and repeated to\nme my own assertion that I probably should not go down there again within\na week. At last I said emphatically, \" It is, indeed, very strange, but I can\nno longer resist the inclination to go and see if anything is wrong with\nMrs. L.\"\nMy friend accompanied me, with some effort. It was now half-past nine\no'clock. We found Mrs. L. sitting on the piazza alone, in the moonlight.\nShe cried out to me delightedly upon hearing my footsteps : \"I have\nspent full half-an-hour calling to you to come.\" Q VAN D CHENOWETH\n\f\u2022JAN., 1896.] Cases. 195\nMrs. Lee adds :\u2014\nThis instance occurred as herein stated, verbatim et ltteratim.\nMRS.

To make such experiments of real value as evidence for\ntelepathy, however, it is, of course, essential that notes should be made\nof them before it is known whether they have succeeded or not, and\nthat all the trials made should be recorded.\nL. 997. Impressions.\nThe following case came to Dr. Hodgson through the collection\nfor the Census of Hallucinations in America. It was sent to him by\nMrs. F. P. Nichols, of 211, St. James-place, Brooklyn, in a letter\ndated April 2nd, 1893.\n343, Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn, N.Y.\n[At] New Orleans, January, 1885, 11.30 a.m., I felt a queer sensation pass\nthrough me, almost as violent as an electric shock, and at the same time I\nbecame aware that my husband, who was about four miles away, had just\nlost his pocket-book, containing considerable money.\nI was enjoying unusually good health that winter. I was riding in a\nstreet-car, thinking intently about a call that I was on my way to make.\nThe car was full of people, all strangers to me.\nThree years previous to the above experience, while trying on a new\ndress at the dressmaker's, I felt that my father's store was being robbed.\nGoing there as quickly as I could, found out that it was exactly as I had felt\nabout it.\nI looked at my watch to note the hour that I felt the queer feeling about\nmy husband's pocket-book, and he said that was the exact time when he first\nmissed it.\nANNE C. GOATER.\nThe following letter from Mrs. Goater, in answer to Dr. Hodgson's\ninquiries, gives further details of the two experiences referred to.\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1896.\n343, Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn, April 22nd, 1893.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014This is the first opportunity I have had to reply to your\nfavour of the 8th inst. Mr. Goater desires me to say that he first became\naware that he had lost his pocket-book when he went to pay for his lunch.\nHe is positive that the hour was between 11.30 and 12 m., as he wished to\navoid the crowd at noon, while my watch indicated 11.30 when I received\nthe impression that something was wrong with his pocket-book. He says he\nis quite sure that he did not think of me in any way at the time, but I have\nalways felt that he must have done so unconsciously.\nI have always taken charge of his money affairs for him, and one of the\nimpressions I had at the time was, that he was very much annoyed with me for\nnot having removed some of the money from his pocket-book, as I was in\nthe habit of doing, when it exceeded a certain amount ; that he in some way\nheld me responsible for his having lost so much money (there was over 100\ndollars in his pocket-book at the time).\nAs regards the robbery at my father's store, I told both the dressmaker\nand my father at least an hour or two before it was found out. The dress\nmaker, when I mentioned my impression to her, was so incredulous that she\nsaid, to satisfy herself, she would go with me to my father's place of business,\nwhich was only a few squares away. We found my father there alone. I at once\ntold him the strange feeling I had, and was very much relieved to hear him\nsay that I had been mistaken, as he was not aware that any robbery had\ntaken place, while everything about the store looked as usual. They both\nlaughed at me for trying to pose as a clairvoyant, as they expressed it, and\nin a few moments the dressmaker left, saying she had had her walk for\nnothing. I remained at the store with my father until the time for closing\nup, an hour or so later. No one had come in during this time. Father then\ngoing to a corner of the store to turn off the gas, discovered at once that\ntwo pieces of cloth that he had been showing earlier in the evening were\nmissing. He then recalled two strangers who had been in about the time I\nwas at the dressmaker's. One had engaged him in conversation on business\nmatters, while the other had remained standing near that corner. He most-\nlikely sneaked off with the cloth.\nUnfortunately I do not know what has become of the dressmaker, but my\nfather is still living, and can verify my statement.\nANNE C. GOATER.\nThe following corroborative notes were received from Mrs. Goater's\nhusband and father.\n[Enclosed in letter dated May 27th, 1893.]\nThe statement Mrs. Goater has made as regards the loss of my pocket-\nbook in New Orleans some years ago is quite correct.\nWALTER P. GOATER.\nMy daughter's statement as regards the loss of some cloth at my place of\nbusiness is entirely correct.\nJ. S. CARR.\n\fNo. CXXVI.\u2014VOL. VII.

I told her that\nwould not be a fair experiment, since she had given the object she was going,\nto think of, and she promised to think of something else. On the appear\nance of the images, I said: \"You have broken your contract, for you are\nthinking of a man and a woman, and the man has on a broad brimmed hat.\"\n(Exactly correct. )\nExperiments 38 and 39 are not copied in my note book.

(On board train en route to St. Louis, Mo.) Mr. Edmonds\nbelieved telepathy an impossible thing, and I volunteered an experiment as\na possible means of convincing him. Time occupied was about ten minutes.\nSaw a woman of very small features, which I thought might be a small\npicture in a locket, as I seemed to see a locket, (Correct\u2014as he was think\ning of his wife, who is dead, and who had, he says, very small features.\nHe had her picture in a locket in his pocket, but said he was thinking of\n\fFEB., 1896.] Experiments in Thought-transference. 201\nthe person and not of the picture. I believe he must have unconsciously\nvisualised the locket and picture.) The agent is an entire stranger to me.\nThe following corroborative note is appended to the account :\u2014\nSkiddy, Kans., June 9th, 1891.\nTo THE HON. SEC. OF THE S.P.R. \u2014I have assisted Dr. A. S. Wiltse in\nseveral of his experiments in thought-transference, and take pleasure in\nstating that his method was as stated. He is blindfolded during the experi\nment, and the mind of the agent is concentrated upon an object unknown\nto the percipient, with results as stated in his notes, to which this evidence\nis attached.\n(Signed) B. BUCKLEY.\nThe second series of experiments was carried out in 1893. Dr.\nWiltse's record of them is as follows :\u2014\nExperiment 1.\u2014Present: Mrs. Anderson, Miss Hall, Mr. D. Hall, Miss\nB. Melton, and others.\nThe writer hypnotised Mr. N. B. Melton to Bernheim's ninth degree, and\ntold him to go to his mother's residence, three miles distant. Miss Belle\nMelton, his sister, had come from home that day and had purposely\narranged for the seance, as changes had been made in her mother's house of\nwhich her brother knew nothing. After a few minutes' silence on the part\nof the percipient, he said there was nobody at home and no light in the\nhouse. I lighted a lamp, \"in his mind.\" He then said they had been\nputting up new wall-paper, and described the same correctly.\n\"There,\" said he, \"is Belle's trunk in the corner of the room.\" I told\nhim to look into it and tell me what was there, but he said it was locked and\nhe had no key.\nMiss M. had left the trunk unlocked, trusting to her mother and sister\nLouise to lock it, in case they left the house, and she had no positive\nknowledge as to whether the trunk was, at this particular hour, locked or\nunlocked. I provided a key for him as I had the light, and he unlocked the\ntrunk and proceeded to take an invoice of its contents, first exacting a promise\nfrom me that I would \"never give him away to the girls.\" \"There is a\npistol,\" said he. This was wrong, although there had been one there, and\nseveral cartridges were really there.\nAfter some trivial details, he exclaimed with a laugh : ' ' Blamed if there\nain't Belle's letters ! What a joke it would be to go through them.\" He\nseemed to be looking them over and I asked him to read some of them to\nme, which he refused to do. I asked how many there were, and he said\nthere were four from her sweetheart and one from a young lady, giving me\nthe name of the lady, also the name of her post-office correctly ; the number\nof the letters was also correctly given, although both he and his sister assure\nme that he knew nothing of the letters. He said there was a note in one of\nthe letters to his sister Louise. This was a mistake, as there is not a word\nin either of the letters to Miss Louise, but a separate note to her had been\nsent in one of the letters and had been given to her.\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., I89ff.\nHe then said that the women had left the clothes out of doors upon the\nline, and Miss M. said she thought this was not true, as such a thing was\nstrictly against their rule. It turned out, however, that percipient was\ncorrect. It was also true that there was no person in the house, as his\nmother and sister had left the house and had gone to spend the night with\npercipient's wife some hundreds of yards away. They had locked the trunk,\nso that in this item also the percipient was correct.\nExperiment 2.\u2014Present : Mrs. Wiltse, Jason, my son, aged 17 years,.\nN. B. Melton, the percipient, and the writer.\nPercipient was placed in the hypnotic trance, and asked to see what was\ngoing on at his own house, three miles away.\nHe named different persons who were there, and said his best sewing,\nmachine was missing. He was at that time selling sewing machines, and had\nbeen away from home all day. He seemed worried about the machine, and\nI tried to pacify him by telling him he was probably mistaken, but he\ninsisted that the machine was certainly gone.\nAwake, he was told what he had said, and he declared he must have been\nwrong, as the machine was a fine one, and his wife would not let it go unless,\nsome person had paid the full price in cash, and he did not know of anyone\nlikely to do that, and no one could get it from his wife on any other terms,\nas she would not know how to write out the contract. It turned out,\nhowever, that the machine in question was missing, just as he had said, for\nhis sisters had purposely taken the opportunity of his absence for a whole day\nand night to carry the machine to their house, a few hundred yards away, to\ndo a special piece of work with, knowing he would make them take a cheaper\nmachine if they applied to him. Percipient told correctly who, besides his\nfamily, were staying at the house, and located them correctly as they were\nsleeping. Part of this may have resulted from inference, since they were his\nmother and his two sisters, but it was very unusual for all three to leave\ntheir own house alone to stay with Mrs. M. while he was away at night, as\nthey had done on this particular night.\nAs a possible demonstration of the [transference of the subconscious ideas,\nof the agent], I shall next cite an experiment made but a few evenings ago,\nin which I was myself the percipient and in which hypnosis played no part.\nExperiment 3.\u2014Mrs. Wiltse and Mr. W. J. Roberts, a telegraph\noperator, acted as agents. I rested my face in a dark-coloured shawl while\nthe agents, sitting some feet from me, fixed their minds upon objects,\nunknown to me, or to each other.\nIn these experiments, some minutes are required to exclude the images\nalready upon the retina, the full accomplishment of which I know by the\nonset of obscure darkness, soon after which I frequently see a changing and\nshifting array of various colours, followed by a clear field of some light colour\nupon which images, more or less well-defined, appear and disappear ; and\nthese images so often prove to be the form of that of which the agent i&\nthinking as, I think, to exclude the theory of chance.\nIn the present experiment I saw a landscape with trees, the most pro\nminent of which were of the family of the coniferse. Also a man clad in a.\nsuit of mail.\n\fFEB., 1896.] Experiments in Thought-transference. 203\nIt so happened that both agents had chosen the home of their childhood\nas the object to be thought of. The trees seemed to be natural enough, such\ntrees standing about Mrs. Wiltse's old home, as she informed us, but what\ndid the man in armour mean 1 Both agents declared they had not thought\nof a man in armour. I began to think it a mere chance image, as I often\nsee images while experimenting and also at other times, for which I can find\nno origin. But I felt that I had probably arrived at the real cause of this\nimage when Mr. Roberts informed me that prominent among his recollections\nof the old home was a picture of a knight in armour, which had hung in the\nsitting room from his earliest recollection, although he was positive he had\nnot consciously thought of the picture during the experiment.\nExperiment 4.\u2014Present ; Mrs. Wiltse, Mrs. N. B. Melton, Mr. W. J.\nRoberts.\nThe percipient, Mr. N. B. Melton, was hypnotised, and told to look up\nthe family he and Mrs. M. were going to visit next day at New River, 23\nmiles distant, of whose residence none of us knew anything at all, more\nthan that they resided somewhere near New River.\nHe described the residence as a framed house containing three rooms,\ngave the direction and the distance from New River, said the family were\nasleep, and gave the number in the family (he may have known this latter\nitem, as they were acquaintances.*) Told to awaken the sleepers, he\nclaimed to be trying to awaken them, and continued the effort for some\ntime. There was no perceptible physical sign of effort, though he said he had\nnearly pulled the man out of bed by the foot, and finally said the woman\nhad wakened, and he believed saw him, as she seemed to look surprised.\nAll this about having produced any effect upon the sleepers was probably\nmere hallucination. The lady of the house was awake several times during\nthe night in question, but did not know at what hour, neither did she have\nany impression or dream which could possibly indicate that any mental im\npression was produced [on her] by the percipient. The rest of the percipient's\nstatements proved correct. But in another room from the one in which the\nfamily were sleeping were two boarders whom the percipient seems to have\nentirely overlooked. (Query. Did he miss these two persons because I\nfailed to tell him to look into more than the one room,\u2014as was really the\ncase,\u2014and he could only see them by actually going into the room, just as in\nphysical life ; or was it an independent freak of the subliminal self, that\nwould not condescend to tell more than it was asked to tell ?)\nE-j-periment 5,\u2014This evening, February 13th, 1893, while engaged upon\nthis paper, my son, having just retired for the night, called out to me from\nthe next room, where he was lying, to tell him what he was thinking about.\nThe method above named was resorted to, and the images I saw written\ndown and handed to Mrs. Wiltse. The record reads thus : \" Saw a deer,\nalso a skiff with two persons in it.\" After Mrs. Wiltse had taken possession\nof the record, the boy was told to say what he had thought of. He said he\nhad been thinking of two things. Of a deer he and I had seen in the woods\n* Percipient informs me later that he supposed there were four children, but\nthat one had died, of which fact, at time of the experiment, he had no intimation.\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 18%.\na few days before, and that he also looked at the picture of a landscape\n(which hangs upon the wall) and thought how he would like to be out on\nsuch a lake, hunting ducks.\nHe had not consciously thought of a boat, but I think it hardly possible\nthat he could have thought of being on the lake hunting ducks, without\nconceiving,\u2014though perhaps all unconsciously to the supraliminal self,\u2014of\nthe means, which naturally would be a boat of some kind.\nExperiment 6.\u2014(Same evening.) This experiment called for another, this\ntime with Mrs. Wiltse as a willing volunteer agent. [The] images seen I\nwrote down as follows : \u2014\n\"Some one riding, I think in a cutter, for there seems snow on the\nground. Some wheeled vehicle\u2014I think a steam car, for there seemed a track\nlike rails a portion of the time. Fort Ryley, cannons, a person, a tent.\"\nThis record was held in my own possession and Mrs. Wiltse was asked\nto say what she had thought of.\nAnswer was, \" 1 was thinking of the time I went to Junction City on the\ntrain to hear Blind Tom play, and of the piece in which he imitated the\nnoise of cannons.\"\nLet us analyse this experiment. Mrs. Wiltse had intended to think of\nBlind Tom playing, \" only that and nothing more ;\" but she actually, although\nalmost unconsciously, took into her mental view almost the whole panorama\nof several different excursions.

She had\nalso visited Fort Ryley, had seen the cannons there and, I presume, the tents\nalso, and I think it not unreasonable or unscientific to assume that, by the law\nof association of ideas, when she called up Blind Tom in the act of playing\nshe also called up to view the whole panorama as I saw it painted upon that\nhidden canvas, her subliminal memory.\nExperiment 7.\u2014(Same evening.)

Not that men like Mr. Gurney, Mr. Myers and Professor\nSidgwick are not aware of them, or have not assumed them, but that it is\nwell to repeat them on this occasion as reminders to those who either ignore\nthem or are not conscious of their existence in inquiries of this kind.\nThe manifold objects with which the Society set out in its work have\nserved often to conceal the criterion of its method and results, and it has\nbeen only when the probability that telepathy is a phenomenon to be\nseriously reckoned with in the field of science was established, that we\ncould discover any clue to the limitations which must apply to methods\nseeking evidence of the supernormal and transcendental, if I may use the\nlatter term to express the existence of forces or causes not presenting them\nselves in the usual space relations to the phenomenon witnessed. The\navowed purpose to investigate seriously such claims as table turning, spirit\nrappings, materialising pretensions, along with those of clairvoyance,\nhypnotism, thought-transference, &c., showed no traces of the common\nmethod which must prevail in the study in order to merit the name of\nscience, and hence until some considerable investigation had been made it\nwas but natural to treat all subjects independently, report facts impartially,\nand assume nothing that might prejudice the seriousness and the value of\nthe work. But I think we have gone far enough for us to formulate some\nprinciple which shall serve as a more definite criterion of proof than seems\nto have been considered in the earlier treatment of physical phenomena\nclaiming to be supernatural or supernormal. This conclusion is especially\nenforced by the final result in the case of Eusapia Paladino, with its reflec\ntion of discredit upon similar cases.\nBut before formulating this principle, I wish to call attention to a peculiar\ndifficulty against which we psychical researchers have to labour in this\nmatter. The very spirit with which we investigate claims which the average\n\fFEB., 1896.] Correspondence. 211\nscientific mind rejects upon a priori grounds disarms the scepticism that is so\neffective and so healthy an attitude for moat men toward the marvellous.\nDoubt is always an incentive to careful observation and some fortification\nagainst illusion, while it prompts difficulties in the way of hasty belief.\nThis, however, we need not be told. But no matter how sceptical we are,\nthe serious attempt to be fair and to treat scientifically even the most pre\nposterous claims, \u2014especially when the facts appear on the surface to be\nhonestly reported and yet outside ordinary experience,\u2014inevitably weakens\nthe ordinary precautions against illusion, and we find ourselves unconsci\nously sympathetic when we ought to be sceptical as well as candid and\nscientific. All these influences have been very much strengthened and\ndoubt disarmed by the amount of truth found in the phenomena of telepathy\ncrystal vision, automatic writing, spontaneous apparitions and hypnotism,\nall of which were once laughed at as illusion, fraud or quackery. Forced to\naccept these against scientific tradition, we very naturally increase our\npatience with claims like those made about Eusapia Paladino, while for\ngetting the one principle which requires to be kept in mind before concluding\nto anything supernormal. The positive results attained in other fields make\nus look for such in cases like hers when the presumption for negative\nresults is sustained by the limitations under which such phenomena occur,\nand yet the very determination to treat disgusting performances with all the\ncare, patience and scientific thoroughness possible either misrepresents us\nbefore the scientific world, or both misrepresents us and creates an obstacle\nto the sceptical observation of the facts. Here then is a situation in which\nwe require to be doubly armed. I hope the principle which I wish to formu\nlate may be helpful in supplying this desideratum, and in affording a pre\nsumption upon which to investigate cases like Eusapia Paladino.\nNow when we look at the results collected by the Society in the three\nfields of telepathy, automatic writing, and mediumistic phenomena like those\nof Mrs. Piper, we observe one uniform characteristic ; namely, that they\nrepresent events or facts obtained through the agency of the subject's nervous\nsystem. This is a most important consideration for the limitations which it\nwould empirically impose upon our expectations of finding exceptionally\ndetermined events independently of such an organism. Thus we find that\ntelepathic impressions, whether of a sensory or ideational character, are\nknown facts only as they are expressed through a nervous system. Automatic\nwriting presents communications only through the same medium and never\nthrough the inorganic matter ; at least, we have no authentic confirmation of\nthe latter. Mediumistic messages come in the same way, and all facts pur\nporting to be physical events independent of such an organism are still sub\njudice, such as spirit rappings, table turning, &c., where human hands are\nnot connected with the objects purporting to be affected. Even the\nphenomena said to occur in connection with Eusapia Paladino are, and\nprofess to be, mediated through her organism.\nNow it is precisely this limitation that affords a presumption against\nany foreign source for the phenomena, vnless they S\/MMO the characteristics\nof personality other than that of the subject. The immensely rich field\nof subliminal influences in the subject itself only adds difficulties to\nthe supposition of the transcendental ; but until multiplied traces of a\npersonality, not expressible in either the subliminal or supraliminal action\nof the subject, are found, it is futile to treat the phenomena seriously\nexcept for satisfying scientific method. Now it is noticeable in all the\ntelepathic, automatic and mediumistic phenomena on which any stress\nhas been laid by the Society, that the force of any and all of them\nlies in the traces of transcendental causes. The facts adduced to prove\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 189C.\ntelepathy, for instance, would have no weight were it not for the proof of\ncoincidental thoughts on the part of others than the subject, under circum\nstances and with connections that either make the hypothesis of chance\nabsurd, or show that scientific method generally is an illusion. In automatic\nwriting the messages have value only as they express intelligent facts of a\ncharacter objective to the medium, and it is extremely difficult to determine'\nwhen such limitations are transcended.\nNow when we come to Eusapia Paladino, we find the general principle\nabove mentioned illustrated in her case ; namely, the occurrence of certain\nphenomena only in connection with her nervous organism. But slappings\non the back of sitters, the whimsical movements of physical object*\nand similar events, are not evidences or expressions of a consciousness\nindependent of the organism in connection with which they occur,\u2014even\nsupposing that they occur when hands and feet are held, \u2014not to say\nanything of the absolutely fatal circumstance in the negative that they\nmust occur only in the dark. The beauty of telepathic and automatic\nphenomena is in the fact that they represent intelligent events, facts which\nhave to be co-ordinated under the conception of mind, and not of physical\nphenomena. The supposed supernormal occurrences in connection with\nEusapia Paladino are nothing of the kind. Not a trace of intelligence\noccurs in them ; so that granting their genuineness,\u2014which can hardly be\nclaimed after the recent investigations at Cambridge, \u2014there is no reason\nto suppose that they express anything more than physical phenomena of\nher nervous system, in which Spiritualism can have no interest whatsoever.\nThe thing to be learned by the average Spiritualist is that his doctrine\ndepends, not upon extraordinary physical events merely, but upon the traces\nof consciousness other than the subliminal and supraliminal action of the\nsubject. It is the transcendental existence and persistence of mind which\nSpiritualism requires to prove, and not the occurrence of physical events in\nwhich no intelligent meaning can be found.\nHence, so far from treating table turning, rappings, noises and such\nphenomena seriously as evidence for its claims, its interest rather lies\nm discrediting them, or proving that they have no pertinency or value\nwhatever. They should be investigated only to show that they are not\nevidential ;\u2014first, for the reason that they are too much complicated\nwith the organism of the subject to escape a possible source in it ; and,\nsecond, for the reason that there is no accompaniment of such intelligent\nmeaning as makes a foreign personality a plausible assumption. The\ncontrast with telepathy and automatic writing, and the phenomena pro\nduced by Mrs. Piper, is too great to justify any serious expectations from\nthe purely physical field. Hence, if we can keep in view two limitations to-\nour problem, we shall not be tempted to attach weight to phenomena\nexcluded empirically from its nature. First, we have the limitation of all\nreliable phenomena of an evidential import to the mediation of some nervous\nsystem. Until this is transcended, purely physical events cannot have a\nspiritualistic meaning. Second, we have the limitations of the spiritualistic\nproblem to phenomena evincing definitely traces of intelligence other than\nthat of the subject,\u2014phenomena requiring a transcendental mind to account\nfor their unity and meaning. The first of these is a precaution against giving\nvalue to merely physical events and hasty exclusion of subliminal or supra-\nliminal action of the subject ; the second provides a criterion for the\nphenomena that can have a psychological and philosophical importance.\nColumbia College, New York.

Arthur\nSmith in the chair.\nPROFESSOR WILLIAM JAMES' \" Presidential Address \" was read by\nMR. F. W. H. MYERS, and will be published in the next number of\nthe Proceedings.\nME. MYERS then read a paper by MR. 0. M. BARROWS on \" Sugges\ntion without Hypnotism,\" an account of experiments in preventing or\nsuppressing pain, which, it is hoped, will appear shortly in the\nProceedings. During the last six years, Mr. Barrows had treated\nseveral hundred persons for insomnia, rheumatism, neuralgia, head-ache,\nhysteria, &c. The patients remained in all cases in a normal waking\ncondition, and Mr. Barrows regarded the results obtained as due to the\naction of telepathy.\nDR. J. MILNE BRAMWELL said the remarkable results obtained by\nMr. Barrows were paralleled in the records of hypnotic work. The\nnovel part of the paper was not the history of cures effected, but the\ntheory accounting for them,\u2014the statement that the patients were\nnot hypnotised and the hypothesis that the method employed was a\ntelepathic one.\nIt would be easier to discuss the paper if the writer had stated\nexactly what he meant by hypnotism. It could be inferred, however,\nthat he considered four conditions essential to hypnosis:\u2014(1) the\nsubject must pass into an unconscious state ; (2) he must give up his\nwill to the operator ; (3) the suggestions must be verbal ones, which\n* See notice on cover, p. iii.\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. |MAH., 1896.\nthe subject is capable of understanding ; (4) the subject must be in\nan abnormal mental condition, i.e., suffering from hysteria, or some\nother form of nervous disorder. Taking these in order, Dr. Bramwell\npointed out (1) that hypnosis was not necessarily followed by amnesia.\nOnly one in ten of Braid's patients passed into a state of unconscious\nness. The International Statistics, published by Dr. von. Schrenck-\nNotzing, gave 11 per cent, of somnambules in 8,705 hypnotic cases\nrecorded. Dr. Bramwell had observed hypnotic cases in which\nanaesthesia could be induced for operative purposes, but where there\nwas no general loss of memory, even in response to suggestion. In\nanother case, where deep hypnosis followed by amnesia had previously\nbeen induced, the patient on a subsequent occasion was rendered\nanaesthetic for operative purposes, in what was apparently the\nwaking state, and retained the recollection of all that had happened,\nthe only abnormal phenomenon being the absence of pain.\nThis patient had eight teeth extracted at one sitting and four\nat another. (2) It was not necessary for the subject to abandon\nhis will. Dr. Bramwell himself had never seen any evidence\nof the so-called automatism of the hypnotised subject, nor a single\ninstance in which a patient was unable to choose between right and\nwrong. Similar views were held by Braid. Certain members of the\nNancy School held opposite opinions, but their position was badly\nsupported by fact, and had recently been successfully attacked by\nProfessor Delboeuf of Liege. (3) Verbal suggestion. Dr. Bramwell\nhad observed at Nancy that Dr. Liebeault made his suggestions, even,\nto uneducated patients, in scientific language, and used anatomical\nterms, which it was quite impossible for them to understand. These-\nsuggestions could not be regarded as verbal in the sense used by Mr.\nBarrows, but no doubt the patients knew that their object was a.\ncurative one, and translated them into terms of their own conscious\nness. (4) Abnormal state of health. This was not necessary. Esdaile\nhypnotised many thousands of the felons and coolies of Bengal and, as\nhe justly remarked, these were neither nervous nor hysterical persons,\nwhile Mr. Wingfield at Cambridge hypnotised 120 undergraduates at\nthe first attempt.\nMr. Barrows asserted that the explanation of the phenomena he\nrecorded was to be found in the fact that by means of telepathic sug\ngestion he had been able to evoke the powers of the \" Subliminal\nConsciousness.\" This he apparently considered as entirely different\nfrom the hypnotic, in evident ignorance of the fact that the subliminal\nconsciousness theory was regarded as the most reasonable and modern\nattempt to solve the problems of hypnotism. Granting the existence\n\fHAH., 1896.] General Meeting. 217\n\u2022of a subliminal state, it is possible that it can be reached by other than\nhypnotic methods. Those employed by Mr. Barrows, however, differ\nlittle from the ones used by hypnotists.\nNow, as to telepathy. Again taking it for granted that the sub\nliminal consciousness exists ; that one can put oneself in communication\nwith it by hypnotic means and afterwards invoke its powers by verbal\nsuggestion, then, if telepathy be true, it ought of course to be possible\nto influence it by similar suggestions conveyed telepathically instead\n\u2022of verbally. What evidence have we for the existence of telepathy in\nthis instance ? Mr. Barrows states that while his patients rested quietly\nin a chair he attempted to influence them by telepathic suggestion, but\npreviously he had verbally informed them that he was going to remove\ntheir existing, or prevent their future, suffering. This suggestion was\nconveyed in the most emphatic manner, with the assertion that the\npredicted result was inevitable. Now the phenomena which occur in,\nor after, hypnosis are not necessarily the result of suggestions made\nduring that condition. Dr. Bramwell had frequently hypnotised deaf\npatients. With them all suggestions were made before hypnosis.\nThese were written and were of two kinds ; one indicated the hypnotic\nphenomena the operator desired to induce, the other the curative results\nthat were to follow. These were as successful as verbal suggestions given\nduring hypnosis. Before admitting the possibility of telepathic influence,\none must demand the exclusion of other causes which have been proved\nto be capable of producing like results. It was also worthy of note that\nMr. Barrows not only found in telepathy the cause of the phenomena he\n\u2022described, but also their explanation. Granting that telepathy did exist\nand that the messages were conveyed in that manner, this did not\nexplain the phenomena. It was a mere substitution of telepathic for\nverbal suggestion, and it was well to remember what has been said by Mr.\nFrederic Myers, namely, that the word suggestion did not explain the\nphenomena of hypnosis, but was simply a definition of the artifice used\nby the operator to evoke them.\nME. F. W. H. MYERS remarked that Mr. Barrows, as appeared from\nthe sense which he gave to the word \"hypnotism,\" had assumed as\northodox the opinions which prevailed a few years since in this rapidly\nprogressing subject. It was all the more interesting to observe that\nhis independent experiments had pointed in exactly the direction in\nwhich the opinion of the best authorities had since been moving.\nAs to the connection between hypnotism and telepathy, on which\nMr. Barrows dwelt, he (the speaker) trusted that there might be further\noccasions of discussion with Dr. Bramwell and other hypnotists on\nthat important point.\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 189&\nG. P. BIDDER, Q.C.\nWe deeply regret to have to announce the loss of a valued member\nof our Council, Mr. G. P. Bidder, Q.C., the news of whose death reached\nus too late for announcement in the last number of the Journal. The\nillness which prematurely cut short Mr. Bidder's vigorous and beneficent\nlife was due to an accident which occurred on the 9th of January, when\nhe was knocked down and run over by a horse and van in the streets\nof Manchester. The injuries he received were not at the time regarded\nas sufficient to prevent his continuing an arbitration case on which he\nwas engaged, and\u2014after a few days' rest\u2014resuming his professional\nwork in London. But a little more than a fortnight after the accident,\nserious symptoms manifested themselves ; and after a few days' illness.\n\u2014the course of which at first seemed hopeful\u2014he died rather suddenly\non Saturday, February 1st.\nMr. George Parker Bidder was the eldest son of the celebrated\nengineer of the same name. He graduated at Cambridge in 1858\nas seventh Wrangler ; was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn in\n1860, became a Q.C. in 1874, and has been for several years one of\nthe leading Counsel at the Parliamentary Bar. But his work at\nWestminster, though sufficiently laborious, did not by any means,\nexhaust his overflowing energies; he was a man of keen and wide\nintellectual interests and abundant public spirit, at once shrewd and\nfearless in the defence of any cause that commended itself to his\njudgment. He always took a strong interest in the investigations\nof the S. P.R., and has been a member of its Council almost since\nthe foundation of the Society : and the support and encouragement\nthat we derived from the adhesion to our cause of a mind like his,\ntrained in scientific reasoning, and at the same time possessing an\nindisputable grasp of practical experience, was always felt by us to\nbe of great value. Nor will those of us who knew him in private life\neasily forget the cordiality of his welcome, the bright, alert vigour of his\ntalk, the varied range of his interests or of his genuine philanthropy.\nH. SIDGWICK.\nEXPERIMENTAL DREAMS.\nIt has been already suggested in this Journal that it is desirable\nto make more attempt than is usually made to suggest, control, and\nanalyse dreams. For this there are two main reasons, one practical\nand one theoretical. From the point of view of practice, every advance\nin self-suggestive power is of importance. The increase of central con\ntrol over the nervous system is the prime achievement of education \u00a3\n\fMAS., 1896.] Experimental Dreams. 219\nand that control may be pushed indefinitely further than has yet been\ndone. There is no direction in which it may not prove useful and\nhealthful to have not only the \" warring members \" but the warring\nnerve-cells well in hand. The desirability of controlling not only the\ninduction but the quality of sleep is especially obvious. If, for instance,\nmen could wake at will from distressing dreams, or could guide them\ninto pleasanter channels, much pain would be spared which is none the\nless real for what is called its unreality. In some cases the actual\nonset of hysteria or insanity might by this means be delayed or\naverted.\nFew of us, however, can so rule ourselves as to proceed straight to\nthis practical end. To help us towards self-government in sleep we\nneed more knowledge of \" such stuff as dreams are made of ;\" and this\nknowledge, again, from a theoretical point of view would be most\nuseful to the psychologist.\nAn interesting series of experiments is briefly reported by Dr. J.\nMourty-Vold, of Christiania, in the Revue de I'Hypnotisme for January,\n1896. Professor VoId has carried on for six or seven years two main\nlines of inquiry; (1) as to the part played in dreams by the sense of\ntouch (contact and temperature) and the muscular sense ; (2) as to the\nrelation existing between objects looked at before sleeping and subse\nquent dreams.\nProfessor VoId succeeded in collecting in Christiania groups of from\nten to forty educated persons of both sexes, to whom he explained the\nexperiments to be tried, without suggesting to them the results likely\nto follow. Passing over a number of precautions and preliminaries, it\nmay suffice here to say that his volunteer dreamers went to bed either\nwith a foot and ankle so bound as to keep the foot bent in the position\nof a person standing on tiptoe, or with several fingers tied together by\na string, or with a tight glove on one hand, or subject to some similar\n\"persistent stimulus.\" This persistent stimulus tended to represent\nitself in dreams with more or less exactness, probably corresponding to\na lighter or deeper degree of sleep.\nThus (1) the subject may dream that he is standing on tiptoe, i.e.,\nthat his foot is curved, as in fact it is. Or (2) he may dream that he\nis dancing ; thus interpreting the sensation of a curved foot in a way\ncorresponding to frequent experience. Or again (3) he may dream that he\nsees some one else with curved foot,\u2014thus showing a slight disaggrega-\ntion of personality.\nOr, finally,\u2014omitting some intermediate grades,\u2014he may dream of\nabstract ideas related in some way to the position of the member.\nIf, say, three fingers are tied, he may dream of the number three, or\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1896.\nsix, or nine. This form of dream, by the way, reminds us of Binet's\ncases where an anaesthetic patient, if pricked three times, feels nothing,\nbut has a hallucinatory vision of three black points. A symbolising\nprocess has gone on, while the sensory brain-centres were too torpid to\ngive their message in any more direct way.\nProfessor VoId's second line of experiments,\u2014upon the effect of\ncolours seen before sleeping,\u2014has also yielded some interesting results.\nColours looked at intently just before closing the eyes tend to reproduce\nthemselves in dream, or to reproduce their complementary colours.\nWe have here an interesting intermediate point between true after\nimages and memory-images. Compare Mr. Bakewel1's experiments,\nProceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 450, where, after gazing at an object before\nthe final closure of eyes, he saw what appeared to him to be a positive\nafter-image of that object on opening his eyes for a moment upon a\nplain white ceiling in the morning.\nThe experiments thus briefly summarised form only a small pro\nportion of the observations which might be made. Just as special\npositions sometimes produce dreams not reproducing but symbolizing\nthe position, so may certain organic disturbances generate dreams\neither plainly symbolical, or at any rate, by association significant of\nthose disturbances. Dr. Head's recent researches (Brain, 1895) into\nthe connection of specific peripheral pains with (often distant) organic\nlesions prepare the way for a tracing of similar pathways which may\nlead from the diseased organ to some apparently unconnected ideational\ncentre ; and indeed some such hidden concatenations have already been\nroughly observed.\nAnother line of inquiry, with which I have dealt elsewhere, will be\nconcerned with the degree of visualising power, and the acuteness of\nsensation of other kinds, in dream. And I should be glad to hear\nof good specimens of dramatised or \" proleptic \" dreams, where (for\ninstance) a dream-personage asks a riddle which the dreamer himself\nseems unable to guess until\u2014still in the dream\u2014he is told the\nanswer.\nEspecially to be desired is the power of knowing that one is dream\ning, and yet continuing to dream. Could this faculty, which sometimes\ncrops up spontaneously for a few moments, be held fast and secured by\npractice, we should have an opportunity even better than is afforded\nby crystal visions of watching with one phase of our personality the\nplay of another. \"I am the doubter and the doubt,\"\u2014as Emerson has\nit,\u2014\"And I the hymn the Brahman sings.\" One would be at once the\ndreamer and the dream, and the reporter thereof for the Society for\nPsychical Research.

I have reserved for it a perfectly new\nseries of experiments, which were made with a new subject, young Laurent,\nwho is well known to the readers of the Annales des Sciences Psychiques.\nThese experiments have not only completely confirmed, in all essential points,\nthose of my paper in the Nouvelle Revue, but they have even added some\nnew facts to them.\nMy critic blames me for using the term animal magnetism,. I am not\nignorant of the fact that this name sounds badly in many ears, and I am\nquite ready to replace it by another which is less in disrepute, for I do not\nattach any importance to words for their own sake. Besides, I took pains\nto explain in what way I meant that. \" He who admits that a physical\ninfluence exercising itself at a distance between two living beings exists,\nshows a belief in animal magnetism in its simplest and most general\nform.\" And I have distinctly compared it with that of Braid and the\nParis school (hypnotism) and also with that of Faria and the Nancy school\n(suggestion). In any case, the facts which I have recorded do not seem to\nme to be explicable unless we assume the existence of a physical influence\nwhich is radiated from my organism to the nervous system of my subjects,\nand which causes in them the observed phenomena (attraction, ansesthesia,\nvarious sensations, etc.)\nIt is true that my critic does not offer any other explanation ; but he\nseems to lean either toward \" mind-reading by hypersesthesia \" or toward\nthought-transference. Nothing is easier than to thus vaguely insinuate\npossible explanations, if one does not take the trouble to confront them with\nthe facts. But I ask how either explanation can account for the first fact,\nwhich put me in the way of this new order of research and which was quite\nincidental. My reiders will forgive me for quoting it here :\u2014\n\"One Sunday morning, he (Gustave P.) had just entered my study\nand had seated himself at the side of my work-table on which his elbow\n* See Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXIX:, p. 599.\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAB., 1896.\nrested. While I was finishing a letter, he conversed with a third person,\ntoward whom he was half turned. I had put down my pen ; my arm, which\nlay on the table with the fingers stretched out, was accidentally near his\nelbow. To my great astonishment, I thought I saw his elbow slide toward\nmy hand, as if it were attracted. As the subject continued to talk and\nseemed totally ignorant of what was happening, without saying a word, I\nlifted my arm slightly, the subject's arm raised itself at the same time. But\nas if the increase of the attraction had awakened his consciousness, Gustave\nP. suddenly interrupted himself, carried his right hand to his left elbow\nwhich he pulled rapidly back, and turning himself toward me, he exclaimed\n' What are you doing to me 1 ' \"\nI ask how the subject could have guessed, at the beginning of the experi\nment, my wish to attract his elbow, since this wish did not exist and since\nthe effect was produced without any prevision on my part.\nMy critic claims that these phenomena of attraction have no real analogy\nwith those of physical magnetism ' ' when we think of the imitativeness\nwhich is one of the common features of deep hypnotic trance.\" He forget*\nthree things, firstly, that my subject had his eyes hermetically bandaged,\nand that all the persons present, when there were any, and myself kept the\nmost perfect silence, which therefore made it very difficult to guess the move\nments to be imitated ; secondly, that the subject, far from being in a \" deep\nhypnotic trance,\" was perfectly awake from the beginning of the se'ance to\nthe end ; thirdly, that the attraction was produced when my hand, or the\ncopper wire, was perfectly still, and at a distance of 10 or 15 centimetres, so\nthat there was consequently no movement to imitate.\n\"In one case,\" adds my reviewer, \"M. Boirac got a sort of polarity\nbetween his hands; but his attempt to verify this in another subject proved\nthat it was not a property of any force emanating from himself, but the\nresult of some sub-conscious interpretation in the mind of the subject.\nThe experiments with the copper wire, if they prove anything, show that\nthe force cannot be conducted from one room to another like electricity.\"\nI acknowledge that this polarity does not show itself with every subject,\nnor even with the same subject at all times, From this it evidently follows\nthat it depends on some unknown and variable condition. But where is-\nthe proof that this condition is \"some sub-conscious interpretation in the\nmind of the subject\"? Even for this interpretation to be possible, the\nsubject, who (let us not forget it) is blindfolded, and to whom no suggestion\nis made, must perceive a certain difference between the effects produced on\nhim by the right hand and the left hand of the operator ; but this very\ndifference itself is polarity. The explanation proposed by my respected\nopponent, is, if I do not mistake it, what logicians call a ' ' circulus-\nvitiosus.\"\nAs to the experiments with the copper wire, I must say that they are\nnot quoted very exactly\u2014or perhaps my words have not been well under\nstood. I am made to say, \"The effect was the same as that of the hand\nitself, while M. Boirac remained in the room ?nd could see what was going;\non ; but when he tried from the next room, with the door closed between,\n\fMAS., 1896.] Correspondence. 223\nthe characteristic symptoms seem to have given place to a general feeling\nof malaise, and heaviness in the head.\" Now my statement was quite\ndifferent ; here is the passage :\u2014\n\"I passed into another room ; the door was closed. I held one end, which\ncommunicated by passing under the door with the persons who remained in\nmy study. The action of -my hand was still transmitted, but the experiments,\ncould not have the same degree of precision, as we were naturally ignorant\nof each other's actions.\" (This signifies that the person in my study\nobserved the same phenomena of attraction and of pricking in the parts\nof the subject's body to which they presented the wire, but without\nmy being able to personally verify the effects and see if they exactly\ncoincided with the action of my right and left hand.) \"Still, when my\nco-operator presented the end of the wire to the subject's forehead (I\nunderline forehead, for I had till then always avoided any action on the\nbrain, and I would even have dissuaded my co-operator, could I have guessed\nhis intention, from making this experiment, having imposed on myself a\nrule to always leave the subject in a waking state), the latter very rapidly\ngave signs of great uneasiness, said that he felt his head becoming hot and\nheavy, and raised his hand to his head as if to put aside this influence.\" I\ntherefore think that I can conclude that the experiments with the copper\nwire, if they prove anything, show that the force can be conducted from one\nroom to another like electricity.\nNow, Mr. Walter Leaf would doubtless prefer to see effects of thought-\ntransference in all these phenomena. I am quite aware that thought-trans\nference is fashionable, and that animal magnetism is not. But with all the\ngood will in the world, I cannot do otherwise than see in the first but a special\nconsequence and a complex form of the second\u2014something like what the\ntelegraph and the telephone are to galvanic electricity. Unless we admit a\nsort of mystic communication between different minds without any material\nmedium\u2014and I doubt much, if this is the pet hypothesis of Mr. W. Leaf, if\nhe will ever succeed in getting for it \"the ear of men of science,\"\u2014I cannot\nunderstand thought-transference, unless we suppose that one brain acts on\nanother through the medium of some physical agency, more or less like the\nradiating and circulating forces of heat, light, and electricity.\nMy respected critic does not absolutely deny this hypothesis. \"We know\nfar too little,\" he says, \" to say that it is not so ; but I am not aware of any\nexperiments which tend to prove it.\" Let him re-read Jussieu's Report on\nMesmerism ; he will see that it was just experiments of an order similar\nto mine which caused him to feel bound to separate himself from the\nother members of the Royal Commission who would not allow themselves\nto admit any real action of one individual on another. The writings of W.\nGregory, Du Potet, Lafontaine and Dr. Bare'ty, will prove to him that facts\nof this kind are not so rare as he believes. The only superiority which I\ncan claim for my experiments is that, being perhaps more au courant of the\neffects of suggestion than the others whose names I have just mentioned,\nI believe that I have taken, in spite of what Mr. Leaf says, more careful\nprecautions to eliminate this cause of error. I could also quote to him\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 18%.\nM. de Rochas' experiments on the exteriorisation of sensibility, which he\nseems either to be ignorant of or to regard as non-existent, and which prove,\nif they prove anything, the existence of a nervous radiation.\nOn the other hand, I agree with my respected critic that my article in\nthe Nourelle Revue, having for principal object that of calling public attention\nto an order of phenomena which is still but little known and little studied,\nrequires to be completed by a less popular, or, in other words, a more\nscientific exposition, and I intend to satisfy this want when I shall have\ncollected a mass of experiments which will be sufficiently numerous and\n\u2022coherent for conclusions which will be deduced from them not to be\ndoubted by anyone.\nE. BOIRAC,\n(Professeur agre'ge' de Philosophie, Dr.-es-lettres).\nn.\nM. Boirac's very courteous reply to my criticism has naturally received\nfull and friendly consideration on my part. Read in connexion with the\narticle in the Aimales (published also in the Revue de I'Hypnotisme for\nDecember last), that in the Nowvelle Revue undoubtedly gives a more favour\nable impression of M. Boirac's method, than when taken by itself. M.\nBoirac's attitude makes me confident that he will recognise my sincere wish\nfor a high standard in such investigations, if I still, after all that he has\nwritten, retain my opinion that considerations which he has left out of view\nare indispensable, before we can accept, even provisionally, the startling\nconclusions to which he has come. I certainly regret if I have seemed to\nsay anything to discourage experiment. But I do maintain, with the utmost\nseriousness, that nothing is more likely to hurt the cause which both M.\nBoirac and I have at heart, than the premature publication of uncompleted\nexperiments in popular magazines, and in this view I am glad to see from\nhis concluding paragraph M. Boirac himself agrees. We shall all await\nwith the greatest interest the fuller publication which he promises.\nThe differences of principle between M. Boirac and myself turn mainly\non the adequacy of the precautions which he regards as sufficient to exclude\n(1) reading of insignificant indications by the subject ; and (2) thought-\ntransference.\nThe precautions described by M. Boirac, such as blindfolding, silence,\nand so on, are probably sufficient to preclude the obvious methods of mere\ngross cheating. But is he adequately on his guard against the more subtle\nmean's by which indications can be gained, often unconsciously, from slight\nmovements, breathing, and so forth ? Is it certain, for instance, that a\nsensitive subject cannot by the sensation of warmth detect at a distance of\n10 or 15 centimetres (4 or 6 inches) the part of his body at which the\noperator's hand is being directed? The blindfolding is of no importance\nhere ; for it is well-known that the most successful \" thought-readers,\" who\ndepend on their skill in detecting such minute indications, find that blind\nfolding is a positive assistance.\n\fMAR., 1896.] Correspondence. 225-\nBut I willingly admit that this hypothesis does not offer a complete\nexplanation of M. Boirac's experiments. M. Boirac says that he has taken\npains to exclude thought-transference. I have looked in vain for an account\nof his precautions. It is true that he gives as one of his conditions\u2014\" Tacher\nde combiner les experiences de telle fagon que 1'operateur lui-meme, au\nmoms la premiere fois qu'il les fait, ne puisae pas preVoir quel en sera le\nresultat et n'en soit informe' que par Tissue \" ; but he does not tell us how\nhe attains this end, nor how he prevents the operator from expecting or\ndesiring a particular result, even if he does not know that he will obtain it.\nAnd, in fact, all his experiments fall admirably into the series of those which\nhave been for many years carried on by various members of the S.P.R.\nSome of them are indeed identical in result ; for instance, the stiffening and\nanaesthesia of a finger steadily pointed at without contact by the operator\nwas obtained in 1883 (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. I., p. 257 ; see also Vol. II.,\np. 201 ; Vol. III., p. 453 ; Vol. V., p. 14). The Committee on Mesmerism in\nthat year were, like M. Boirac, inclined to favour the theory of an \" effluence; \"\nbut the most recent experiments, those of Mrs. Sidgwick and Miss Alice\nJohnson, recorded in Vol. VIII., pp. 577-596, have led those careful observers\nto the distinct conclusion (p. 579) that \" the true explanation of the results\nis thought-transference or mental suggestion.\" Will not M. Boirac try some\nfurther experiments to eliminate the possible effects of his own wishes and\nexpectation ? He will find abundant suggestions in the various papers\nreferred to and in Dr. Mol1's elaborate series of experiments recorded in his\n\" Kapport in der Hypnose \" where the question of effluence is fully investi\ngated ; and he will doubtless on reflexion see the absolute necessity of the\n\" control experiments,\" which have so far not been mentioned in his\npublished papers.\nWith regard to the experiment of the copper wire, I fear that I must\nstill maintain my previous opinion. If the effluence were conducted like\nelectricity, the interposition of a copper wire should have made no appreci\nable difference to the phenomena. But in fact the phenomena immediately\nlost their ' 'precision\" : and what was observed is exactly what one would have\nexpected on the supposition that the subject was guided by the reading of\nminute indications, aided probably by a certain amount of thought-trans\nference. When M. Boirac retires into the next room, the subject knows that\nsomething is expected of him ; he detects, presumably by the movements of\nM. Boirac's colleague, that it has something to do with his head ; but he is\nno longer able to read precisely what is meant, and his feelings naturally\nexpress themselves in a general malaise connected with his forehead.* Has\n(Continued on p. 228.)\n* I am sorry if M. Boirac thinks that I did not properly represent what happened\nin this experiment ; but I confess that I do not quite clearly understand it even after\nhis explanation. Does he mean that the polar effects were as distinctly perceived\nas before, and that the \"want of precision\" refers only to the difficulty of ascertaining\nthat that they were synchronous with his changes of hand ? This, if it is so, should\nbe less ambiguously stated.\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Boirac is such as to exclude thought-\ntransference ; for all we can tell, the movements of the elbow which caught\nhis attention may have been purely fortuitous ; the instant that they had\nsuggested to him the idea of attraction, thought-transference is no longer\nimpossible.\nOn the general question of \" effluence\" versus thought-transference, I am\nnot sure that I understand M. Boirac's position. From his original account\nI concluded that he considered the nervous radiation to act upon the peripheral\nnervous system of the subject, whether directly or by locally affecting the\nactual molecules of the body at the point to which it was directed, but in any\ncase without any intervention of the subject's brain. The thought-transference\nhypothesis, on the other hand, as I understand it, regards that brain as an\nessential link in the chain ; every mental suggestion involves as one step\nsomething in the nature of the interpretation of a symbol. How it is possible\nto see in the second only \"a special consequence and complex form\" of the\nfirst, I do not understand. The intervention of a psychic link seems to me\nto set the two hypotheses poles asunder. True, the words ' ' unless we suppose\nthat one brain acts on another through the medium of some physical agency \"\nwould appear to imply that M. Boirac does assume the intervention of the\nbrain of the subject ; but the whole tendency of his experiments and of the\nrest of his argument points in the opposite direction. What else is the\nmeaning of his wish to eliminate thought-transference as a possible factor ?\nAnd it is just because the earlier experimenters to whom he refers were\nignorant of this highly important factor that I find it impossible to accept\ntheir conclusions as of any validity at the present day.\nWALTEB LEAF.\n\fNo. CXXVIIL\u2014Vol. VII.

Mr. R.\nPearsall Smith was voted to the chair. There were also present, Sir\nAugustus K. Stephenson, Q.C., Dr. Abraham Wallace, and Messrs.\nF. W. H. Myers, F. Podmore, and H. Arthur Smith.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as correct.\nFour new Associates were elected, whose names and addresses are\ngiven above.\nThe election of twenty-two new Associates of the American Branch\nwas recorded.\nThe Council recorded with regret the death of Mr. G. P. Bidder,\nQ.C., who for many years had been a Member of the Council ; also\nthe death of Mr. H. G. Gurney, a Member of the Society.\nAt the request of Mr. John G. Haggard, his name was transferred\nfrom the list of Members to that of Associates.\nThe House and Finance Committee presented a report, accompanied\nby estimates of the Income and Expenditure of the Society for the\ncurrent year. The full discussion of the report was adjourned to the\nnext meeting of the Council.\nVarious other matters having been discussed, it was agreed that\nthe next meeting of the Council should be on Friday, April 24th, at\n3 p.m., at the Westminster Town Hall, previous to the General\nMeeting arranged for that day.\nEUSAPIA PALADINO.\nIt will be seen that at our last meeting a question was asked with\nregard to \" phenomena \" obtained by Eusapia Paladino subsequent to\nthe exposure of her frauds at Cambridge. It may be well that I\nshould briefly state why I do not intend to give any account of these\nphenomena.\nIt has not been the practice of the S.P.R. to direct attention to\nthe performances of any so-called \" medium \" who has been proved\nguilty of systematic fraud. Now, the investigation at Cambridge, of\n\fAPB., 1896.] General Meeting. 231\nwhich the results are given in the Journal for November, 1895, taken\nin connexion with an article by Professor Richet in the Annales des\nSciences Psychiques for Jan.-Feb., 1893, placed beyond reasonable\ndoubt the fact that the frauds discovered by Dr. Hodgson at\nCambridge had been systematically practised by Eusapia Paladino for\nyears. In accordance, therefore, with our established custom, I propose\nto ignore her performances for the future, as I ignore those of other\npersons engaged in the same mischievous trade.\nH. SIDGWICK.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 78th General Meeting of the Society was held at the 'West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, March 13th, at 8.30 p.m., Mr. R.\nPearsall Smith in the chair.\nA paper on \" Sub-conscious Reasoning,\" by Dr. WM. ROMAIKE NEW-\nBOLD, Assistant Professor of Philosophy, University of Pennsylvania,\nwas read for the author by Mr. F. W. H. MYERS. It is intended to\npublish this paper in the forthcoming number of the Proceedings.\nIt contains some remarkable instances of problems solved during\nsleep ;\u2014in one case with the dramatic intervention of an Assyrian\npriest, who explains the nature of certain agate objects, and the\ninscription thereon, in a way previously unsuspected, but afterwards\nproved to be correct. It was, however, shown that all the facts on\nwhich the dream-solution was ultimately based had been previously\nknown to, although some of them had been forgotten by, the dreamer.\nMr. PAGE HOPPS remarked that when dreams, such as one which\nhe had himself had, were premonitory of future events, the ingenious\nexplanations of Professor Newbold would not apply.\nOn some incidental points in Professor Newbold's paper, Mr.\nF. W. H. MYERS made remarks to the following effect :\u2014\n\" Professor Newbold has touched upon two classes of dreams,\nwhich he seems to regard as both of them involving what he terms 'a\ntranslocation of the time series\/ the conclusion having been first\ngiven, and the dream constructed backwards, in a kind of time-\nhallucination. It does not seem clear to me that the two groups of\ndreams stand on the same footing in this respect. First comes the\ngroup where one definite noise or shock seems to have generated a\nlong and complex dream leading up to the shock, as when the bed-pole\nfell on Maury's neck, and he had a long dream of the Reign of Terror,\nending with his being guillotined. Here I fully agree that there has\nbeen a kind of retroactive hallucination ; that the previous incidents\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APR., 189ft\nhave in some way been developed from the shock itself, and have\npassed through the brain with unusual rapidity, and during the very\nact of waking. The problem thus involved gains in interest as we-\nbecome more capable of measuring the normal speed of thought, and it\nis to be wished that any one waking from a dream of this type would at\nonce record all the details which he can remember with certainty, sa\nthat we might the better judge how far that rush of images must be-\nheld to have transcended normal rapidity.\n\" The second group consists of dreams which (like the dream of the\nAssyrian priest) lead up to a denouement which does not itself depend,\nupon any sudden external stimulus. Here also Professor Newbold\nseems to think that the dream is not really presented in time as a\nforward-rolling story,\u2014a 'mystification by the sub-conscious self,' as he-\nterms it,\u2014but is, as in the first group, projected backwards by a retro\nactive hallucination, from the moment when the perception of the\nculminant fact shapes itself in the dreaming brain. I do not think this,\nhypothesis needful ; since all dream is more or less dramatic, and an\nordinary dream often consists of a stream of incidents,unexpected by the\ndreamer, but linked to one another, as he can discern when awake, by\nobscure associations of thought. In these ordinary cases, the dream is.\nsurely unrolling straight on in the normal process of time ; and the\ntrivial puzzles and solutions which occur in its course are analogous\nto the more interesting puzzle and solution of the Assyrian inscription.\nIndeed, all dreams, if any, must be classed as ' mystifications by the\nsub-conscious self,' since in all dreams there is at least so much scission\nof personality that the stream of events appears objective and\ndistinct from the dreamer's subjective perception of them. Nor is\nthere any obvious limit of such dramatic dream-severance of strata of\nthe self. Here also new and careful observations might have a real\npsychological interest.\"\n\" Miss X \" rose to suggest that from no point of view were dreams-\nmore interesting than in their analogy with the waste products of the\nmind, with meaningless crystal visions, or idle fancies, or the often-\nincoherent or foolish statements of automatic writers and table-tilting\n\" mediums.\" These, it seemed obvious, were much on a level, so far as\ntheir psychic value was concerned. But just as in such externalisa-\ntions of mind action, so in dreams, one often found traces of more\nvaluable sub-conscious activity, and she proceeded to quote a case\nwhich had lately come under her immediate notice.\n\"Miss X\" had been called upon one morning in February to\ninterview a clerk from the Inland Revenue Office in the absence of the\nmember of the household for whom his visit was intended. He had\n\f., 1896.] General Meeting. 233\n\u2022called to request that certain papers\u2014of which \" Miss X \" personally\nknew nothing\u2014which related to a claim for a return of Income Tax,\nshould be forwarded to his office. No mention was made of any\namount. \" Miss X \" delivered the message. On the night of February\n58th her friend dreamt that the sum of eleven and eightpence had\nbeen returned to her, and next day, after making a note of the fact,*\nshe, as a matter of curiosity, proceeded to calculate the amount due,f\nwhich proved to be eleven and eightpence. She had never but once\nbefore made a similar claim, and on that occasion it had been for the\narrears of three years and had amounted to between 29 and 30 shillings,\nso that it was not a case of sub-conscious memory. The tax-collector's\nvisit had no reference to this particular claim.\nThe next paper read consisted of selections from DR. HODGSON'S\n\" Notes on Further Trance Phenomena with Mrs. Piper.\" Time admitted\nof the reading of a few cases only, which will, it is hoped, be printed\n-along with others in a future number of the Proceedings.\nThe CHAIRMAN remarked upon the unusual felicity of the com\nbination of an observer so acute and so skilled in the detection of\nfraud as Dr. Hodgson, with a sensitive of the exceptional powers of\nMrs. Piper. In his belief, there had never before existed a conjunc\nture from which so much of sound and cautious psychical discovery\n\u2022was likely to spring. He regarded it as one of the very first duties\n\u2022of the Society to work this vein to the utmost ; and he felt much\nsatisfaction in the thought that, after some eight years of patient\nand persistent observation, the resultant phenomena were both in\nthemselves more interesting, and also sustained by a greater mass of\ntestimony, than at any previous period. He hoped that a second visit\n\u2022of Mrs. Piper to Europe might at some time be arranged.\n* The original memorandum :\u2014\" 11\/8 \",\u2014written before the papers referred to\ntelow were opened,\u2014is now in our possession.\nt The lady in question adds:\u2014\"March 21s\u00ab, 1896.\u2014This involved the collection\nfrom three different places of six separate papers, which had been put away un\nopened as they had come from the Bank, and which contained memoranda of the\n.following separate amounts :\u2014Is. 6d., Is. Gd., 2s. 4d., 2s., 2s., 2s. 4d., total, 11s. 8d.,\nwhich are sufficiently varied to complicate the probabilities of chance-coincidence.\nThe usual date for sending in such claims being April, the papers would not have\nbeen looked at for some time, but for the dream.\n\"I wish to add that 'Miss X.'s' account of the dream is perfectly correct. I\nwrote to her about it the day after. I think it possible that the impulse to dream\nabout so trifling a fact may have arisen from my having decided that day, in response\nto a friend who asked for help in a benevolent purpose, that I would give to it the\nsum which should be returned from the Revenue Office.\n\"CONSTANcE MOOBI.'\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APR., 189G.\nMr. PAGE HOPPS inquired whether it was intended to invite any\nmember of the S.P.R. to summarize the account in the Annales des\nSciences Psychiques of the phenomena obtained by Eusapia Paladino\nin France ; to which Mr. Myers replied that he understood that, in the\nview of the Editor of the S.P.R. Proceedings and Journal, the task\nsuggested might be more fitly left to some other organ.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE\nAT A DISTANCE.\nWe have often urged on members of the Society the importance of\ntrying experiments in thought-transference with agent and percipient\nso far separated that the latter cannot be guided by unconscious\nindications of any kind given by the former, which it is impossible to\nmake sure of excluding when the two persons are together in the same\nroom. Some of the most striking successes so far published are\nquoted in Mr. F. Podmore's Apparitions and Thought-transference,\nChapter V., and though they are not numerous, it must be remembered\nthat probably very few experiments of the kind have ever been made.\nWhile the amount of success hitherto obtained is sufficient to\nencourage further effort, a good deal more is wanted before the theory\nof telepathy can be established on the same footing as other scientific-\ngeneralisations.\nIn the hope therefore that further effort will be made, we print\nthe following short series of experiments, carried out by two ladies,\nMiss Campbell and Miss Despard, who have previously made successful\nattempts (see Journal S.P.R., Vol. VI., pp. 4-9).\nIt will be seen that the value of these experiments depends on the\ndescriptions of the witnesses having been written by each before com\nparing notes with the other. All the letters quoted, with the envelope*\ncorresponding to the first two of them, are in our possession.\nMiss Despard describes the general conditions of the experiments\nthus :\u2014\nAgent in Surbiton, Percipient in London, W.C. district, distance about\n14 miles.\nAgreed upon:\u2014Agent to concentrate attention at 11p.m. ; percipient\nto then write down any impression received. Experiments to begin on\nDecember 27th, 1895 ; one experiment each night, alternately an object\nand a diagram. December 31st to be omitted.\nThe first account is a letter written from Surbiton by the agent,.\nMiss Despard, to Miss Campbell in London.\n\fAPR., 1896.] Thought-transference at a Distance. 235\nStrathmore, Surbiton Hill Park, Surbiton.\nDecember 27th, 1895. 11.30 p.m.\nDEAR K. \u2014As you know, we agreed a few days ago to try some experi\nments in thought-transference,\u2014to begin to-night at 11 p.m.,-\u2014alternate\nnights to think of an object and a diagram. So to-night I fixed my attention\nabout 11.4 p.m. on a brass candlestick with a lighted candle in it. I feel the\nresult will not be very satisfactory, for I found difficulty in concentrating my\nmind, and not having decided previously what object to think of, I looked\nover the mantlepiece first and rejected two or three things before fixing on\nthe candlestick. A very noisy train was also distracting my attention, so I\nwonder if you will think of that.\nDecember 2Sth, 11.45 p.m.\u2014I thought of this diagram, [a cross inscribed\nin a triangle] the [triangle] in thick black, and the cross inside in lighter.\nDecember 29th, 11.40 p.m. I hope this will be more successful. I found\nto-night I could bring up a much clearer mental picture of the object,\u2014a\nsmall Bristol ware jug about six inches high, the lower part being brownish\nred, of a metallic coppery colour, the upper part having a band of reddish\nand light purple flowers of a somewhat conventional rose pattern\u2014handle\ngreenish. I do not think you have seen this jug, as it has been put away in\na cupboard and only lately brought out. I saw the jug chiefly by bright fire\nlight.\nDecember 3Qlh, 12 midnight. I am very tired and fear the result is vague;\nthis is the diagram.\nMy mental image was not as correct, but tended to slope up to the right.\nLet me know your impressions soon.\u2014Yours, &c.,\nR. 0. DESPARD.\nThe corresponding account of the percipient, Miss Campbell, is as\nfollows :\u2014\n77, Chesterton-road, W.,\nDecember 29th, 1895.\nDEAR R.,\u2014I have nothing very satisfactory to report. I am sorry to say\nI quite forgot on the 27th about our projected experiments until I was just\ngetting into bed,when I suddenly remembered, and just then I heard a train\nmaking a great noise, and as I have never noticed it like that before, I\nwondered if it was one of your trains. I could not fix my mind on any\nobject, but clock, watch, bath, all flitted past, and the circle of firelight in\nthe front room ; the only word that came to me was \" sand \" and a sound like\nfc or q at beginning of a word (you know I as often hear the name of the\nobject as see the thing itself). I stopped, for it seemed ridiculous, but you\nmust have attracted my attention, for just after I stopped I heard the clock\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APR., 1896.\nhere strike the half hour, and found next morning it was twenty minutes\nfast, so when I \" suddenly remembered,\" it must have been just after\neleven.\nLast night I believe you forgot, for I had no strong impression, but you\nsee the paper enclosed.* The scribbles in corner my pencil did without me;\nthe rectangle I believe was a guess ; as for the circle, my pencil would go\nround and round in the centre making that spot, the circle itself being a\nvery shadowy impression.\n11.15 p.m. The first thing that came into my mind was a sponge, but I\nthink that was suggested by the sound of water running in the bath-room,\nand next I had more distinctly an impression of a reddish metallic lustre,\nand I thought it must be the Moorish brass tray on May's mantlepiece ; but\nat last I saw quite distinctly a small jug of a brownish metallic appearance\nbelow, with above that a white band with coloured flowers, lilac and crimson,\non it. I can't be sure what it was like at the top, for that seemed to be in\nshadow and seemed to be darkish,\u2014perhaps like the bottom, but I saw no\nmetallic gleam. I don't remember anything like this among May's things,\nbut the impression was so vivid I describe it.\n3Qth, 11.15 p.m. Thought vaguely of a triangle and figure like this,\n^ but no vivid impression ; if you were thinking of any figure at\n^J^^^ a^> were also thinking of something else.\nm I 31st. I send you this as far as it goes and shall be glad to\nMm a hear from you with your accounts. \u2014Yours,\ni^ C. M. CAMPBELL.\n15, Heathcote-street, W.O.\nThe post-marks on the envelope of Miss Despard's letter to Miss\nCampbell show that the letter was stamped at Kingston-on-Thames\nat midday of December 31st (and therefore was posted before that\nhour) and arrived in London on January 1st.\nThe post-marks on the envelope of Miss Campbel1's reply are\nunfortunately illegible in parts. They show that the letter was posted\nin London before 3.15 p.m. (date illegible) and arrived at Kingston-\non-Thames on December 31st, at 6.45. The mark being partly cut\noff by the edge of the envelope did not show whether it was at 6.45 a.m.\nor p.m., but the post-office official who informed us of the meaning\nof the letters used in the marks was strongly of opinion that it must\nhave been p.m., since the letter started from London at 3.15 p.m. He\nthought this showed that the illegible date on the London post-mark\nshould have been December 31st, since a letter posted before 3.15 p.m.\nin London would, in the ordinary course of things, reach Kingston\nthe same evening. He was of course simply asked to give an inde\npendent opinion about the post-marks, without knowing what dates\n* The diagram enclosed is not at all similar to the agent's figure.\n\fAPB., 1896.] Thought-transference at a, Distance. 237\n\u2022were written on the letters within, which, it will be observed, coincide\n\u2022with his opinion.\nThus the post-marks prove that Miss Campbell posted her letter\nbefore receiving Miss Despard's ; and tend strongly to prove that Miss\nDespard posted hers before receiving Miss Campbel1's.\nFive more experiments were made, of which the following is the\nagent's account :\u2014\nStrathmore, Surbiton.\nJanuary 1st, 1896. 11.40 p.m.\nDEAR K.\u2014Have thought of a small dog's whip hung on M. 's wall, but did\nnot see it clearly, kept thinking of it in use; was in E.'s room, looking at\nsome dresses, and could not give whole attention to it.\nJanuary 2nd. 11.15 p.m.\u2014Thought of small almanac with a picture of\npink roses on it.\nJanuary 3rd. 11.30 p.m.\u2014Thought of [a diagram.]\nJanuary 4th.\u2014Thought of the basket-work armchair ; visualised it very\nbadly.\nJanuary 5th, Sunday. 11.10p.m.\u2014[A diagram], not good.\nI am, sincerely yours,\nR. C. DESPAK.D.\nThe percipient, Miss Campbell, wrote as follows. Her envelope\nwas addressed to Miss Despard at Surbiton, but apparently not posted\nfor the reason given in her final sentence.\n15, Heathcote-street, W.C.\nJanuary 1st, 1896. 11.10p.m.\u2014[Sketch of a capital S, the upper part\nsloping to the right and the lower to the left]. First I had inclination to let\nmy pen wriggle, then saw large capital S, and heard sound of letter, though\nthis was most probably imagination.\nJanuary 2nd. 11.30 p.m.\u2014Had a very vivid impression of your walking\nup to the chest of drawers in your room, opening the top drawer and touching\nthose velvet and lace straps, as if you were meditating what you could think\nof, and looking in front of you at the little glass-fronted bookcase ; then\nthere was a small scrimmage between the cat and the dog from down\nstairs and I lost the thread ; but next seemed to be touching a book\u2014no, a\nsingle leaf, a sheet of writing paper, and then it seemed to be pink and\nblotty ; but it all seemed very aimless and I had a bad headache, so could\nnot concentrate attention well.\nJanuary 3rd. 11.30 p.m.\u2014I saw the following in succession [four\ndiagrams, not resembling that of agent.] I had a curious impression of a\ndark blue colour with a wave of lighter blue going through, not attached to\nany substance.\nJanuary 6th.\u2014To conclude this before I see you. I was reading on\nSaturday, 4th, and forgot all about experiment till I finished my story at\n\u2022quarter to twelve. Did you think of anything on Sunday? I was late\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research- [APK., 1896.\nreturning from C.Rd., and it struck eleven just as I came out of King's\nCross Station ; thought of nothing definite.\u2014Yours,\nC. M. CAMPBELL.\nWill post this if you do not return to-day.\nSome points in these experiments seem especially noteworthy :\u2014(!)\u2022\nthat the impression, though visual on the part of the agent, seemed often\nto be externalised in an auditory form by the percipient ; (2) that\nthe experiments with objects were more successful than those with\ndiagrams, possibly because the agent may unconsciously have taken\nmore interest in them ; (3) that the experiments where the agent was\nconscious, as recorded at the time, of a failure to visualise the object\nclearly or to concentrate her mind on it, were generally unsuccessful\n(see experiments of January 1st, 4th, and 5th). In the experiment\nwith the brown jug, on December 29th, the detailed correspondence\nof the percipient's impression with the real object was certainly\nremarkable, while it is evident from the agent's description, that\nher mental image of it was decidedly clearer than usual.\nCASES.\nL. 998. Dream.\nThe following is a recent case of apparent telepathic clairvoyance,\nwhich, as will be observed, rests on unusually good evidence, since it\nwas noted before verification, while the full account of it was written\nfrom notes made immediately after, by our colleague, Professor A.\nAlexander. He says, in sending the account from Rio Janeiro :\u2014\nFebruary 4Ah, 1896.\nMy informant, Senhor Nascimento, is a life member of the \" Society of\nArts,\" and received his technical education in London.\nRio, February 3rd, 1896.\nA recent case of apparent clairvoyance has been communicated to me\nby a Brazilian engineer, called Jose' Custodio Fernandes do Nascimento,\nwho is himself the percipient. I have been acquainted with this gentleman\nfor several years and know him to be a careful and trustworthy witness.\nIt will be seen that he has enabled me also to give direct testimony to the\ncare with which he has provided for proper evidence.\nIn thus proceeding, he endeavours to atone for former laxness, inasmuch\nas some seven or eight years ago he failed to take adequate note of a\nprobably veridical dream, in which he seemed to be trying to escape with his\nfamily from the deck of a burning vessel, and to witness the jumping over\nboard of a man whose clothes had caught fire. A telegram from a northern\nBrazilian port subsequently gave the news that about that time fire had\nbroken out on board a certain vessel and that on the occasion some\n\fAPR., 1896.] Cases. 2391\nindividual had in reality jumped into the sea, more or less in the manner\nperceived in the dream.\nShortly after three p.m. on Saturday, January 11th, 1896, I met Senhor\nNascimento in the Rua do Ouvidor in this city, and he at once gave me\nverbal particulars of a second experience of the kind, which he had had on\nthat very date.\nHe stated that, as the result of slackness in his business, he had lately\nbeen straitened for want of means and had felt this impecuniosity all the\nmore that his eldest daughter is shortly to be married to the son of a Don J. ,\na merchant resident in Montevideo.\nOn the preceding evening of the 10th, the young man J. came to visit his\nfiancee at the usual hour, and mentioned that a letter from his father was\nwaiting for Senhor Nascimento in the Rua da Alfandega at the firm of Jorge\nBias Brothers, the correspondents in Rio of Don J. He had not brought it\nhimself, as it was to be delivered to Senhor Nascimento personally.\nMy informant awoke on the following morning at an early hour, and fell\nagain into a state of slumber between 5 and 6 o'clock. He then dreamt\nthat he had called at Dias Brothers and that they handed him a present from\nDon J. of one conto of reis (about \u00a340), which he was so glad to receive that\nhe embraced the members of that firm with an effusion of tears. In the\ndream he seemed to count the money.\nHe rose with the conviction that his vision would be realised, although\nno ordinary reasons concurred to make him suppose that such would be the\ncase. This belief led him to write down on a slip of paper (which is\nherewith enclosed) the following note :\u2014\n\"Sonhei que ao ir receber a carta dos Senhores Jorge Dias estes me\nentregaram a somma de 1 : 000 $ 000 de reis, e que eu commovido abracei-os\nchorando.\" 11-1-96.\n(\"I dreamt that on going to receive the letter from Senhores Jorge Dias,\nthe latter delivered to me the sum of 1 : 000 $ 000 of reis, and that I, being\nmoved, embraced them with tears.\" 11-1-96.)\nSenhor Nascimento said nothing to his wife or children about the dream.\nHe merely put the above note under other papers in a pigeon-hole of his\nbureau, which he then locked. He went into town ; called at half past ten\nat the house of Jorge Dias Brothers, and received the letter, which he\nafterwards opened in the street. This letter he showed to me when we met.\nIn it Don J. makes a present of one conto of reis to his future daughter-in-\nlaw, and instructs Senhor Nascimento to draw the money at the house of .John\nMoore and Co. of this city. This sum Senhor Nascimento had duly received\nabout 1 o'clock on that day, and he invited me to accompany him home to\nverify what he had stated regarding the note taken in the morning. The\nconto of reis was shown to me ; the bureau was opened in my presence, and\nthe slip of paper was taken out of the pigeon-hole and immediately delivered\ninto my keeping.\nOn Monday the 13th, I returned for further information. By direct\nquestioning, Senhor Nascimento had learnt that his friends, the Dias Brothers,\nwere not aware of the contents of the letter at the time of its receipt.

J.'s\nbrother has no other connection with him than that established by the\ncoming union between the families, and yet the dream coincided with the\narrival of the letter at Rio and not with its despatch from Montevideo.

Dinner hour came, and at table I said,\nI wished I knew whether he was where he could get any dinner. Dr. Wiltse-\nwas at the table, and said he could apparently see him in the woods on the\nhigh bank of a creek, at a point of the creek that was full of rocks, and that\nhe was on the left bank. We noted the hour, and when my husband,\nreturned, without telling him, we asked him to describe the ground upon*\nwhich he was hunting at that hour, as nearly as he could judge of the time of:\nday. He studied a little, and described the very place Dr. Wiltse had\ndescribed. It was five miles off from us.\nOn the same day he told several people who were here what object they\nwere thinking of, that is to say, if they told the truth. Certainly he was\nright in my own case in the experiment.\nVery recently my husband was attending court in an adjoining county,\nand had been gone several days when the doctor came and was much\ndisappointed at finding him absent. After waiting a couple of days for him,\nhe said one evening, \"Jackson has settled his affair in someway that pleases\nhim, and has started home.\" He then went on to describe the court house\nand the street, and said my husband had stopped in the street and was\ntalking to three or four men who were some distance from him ; that he was\ncoming only part way home that evening, and would stay over night at a\nhouse on the left of the road coming towards us. All this turned out correct,\nexcept the side of the road, which was wrong as to the new road, but right as\nto the old road upon which the house was originally built.\nMARY HOWARD.\nBuck Lick, Tennessee, April 1st, 1894.\nR.

Thought-transference.\nThe following case, obtained for us by Dr. Bramwell, is very similar\nto those described above by Dr. Wiltse, except that it occurred\nspontaneously instead of as the result of a deliberate effort. The\npercipient, Mr. de Solla, is a gentleman well known in the musical\n\u2022world. He writes to Dr. Bramwell :\u2014\nFebruary 5th, 1896.\nDEAR DR. BRAMWELL,\u2014As promised I now send an account of my little\nthought-transference experience. 'Twas thus. I sat opposite my eldest\ndaughter, who was reading a book by the fireside. Presently I exclaimed,\n\"Good gracious ! \" My daughter saying, \" What is it ? \" I replied, \" I could\nhave sworn I saw a dog enter the room.\" I described the dog minutely.\nMy daughter in great surprise told me that she had that moment read a\ndescription of just such a dog. I do not even now know the title of the\nbook. We kept no dog at the time, nor had we conversed about one.\u2014\nJTaithfully yours,\nISIDORE DE SOLLA.\nIn reply to our enquiries, Mr. de Solla -writes :\u2014\n5, Harrington-square, London, N.W., March 8th, 1896.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014In reply to yours of 4th hist., the incident re thought-\ntransference 'twixt my daughter and myself took place on a Sunday about a\nyear ago. My daughter would be willing to give an account of the matter.\nShe does not remember my giving a detailed description of the dog, but\nsimply that I exclaimed, \"I just saw such a big dog rush into the room.\"\nMy daughter tells me that immediately before my exclamation she had read\nthe following words from a book (Lewis Arundel) :\u2014\"As he spoke, he\nuttered a low peculiar whistle ; in obedience to his signal a magnificent\nLivonian wolf-hound, etc., etc., sprang into the room.\"\nIt is not a common experience of mine to imagine I see anything\nanywhere which is not tangibly present, and I am very sceptical about other\nfolks' reports re such things.\nISIDORE DE SOLLA.\nL. 1075. Animal Apparition.\nWe have\u2014as might naturally be expected\u2014very few well-authenti\ncated cases of veridical impressions relating to animals. But if we\n\u2022compare the following case with Mr. de Solla's experience, just given,\nthere seems no difficulty in regarding it as an ordinary instance of\nthought-transference, the agent being perhaps the person in whose\ncharge the dog was left. The percipient, Mrs. Bagot, of The Palace,\nHampton Court, wrote her account in February, 1896. Both Mrs.\nBagot and her daughter who confirms the account are known to\nMr. Myers.\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APE., 1896,\nI was at Mentone in the spring of 1883, having left at home with the-\ngardener a very favourite black and tan terrier, \"Judy.\" I was sitting at\ntable d'hote with my daughter and husband and suddenly saw Judy run\nacross the room, and exclaimed, \"Why, there's Judy!\" There was no\ndog in the room or hotel, but I distinctly saw her, and when I went\nupstairs after table d'hote, told my other daughter, Mrs. Wodehouse, what\nI had seen.\nThe next letter from home told me that Judy had gone out in the-\nmorning well, had apparently picked up some poison, as she was taken ill\nand died in half an hour ; but I cannot say whether it was on the same day\nthat I had seen her.\nShe was almost a human dog, so wonderfully intelligent and under\nstanding, and devoted to me.\nJ.

[MAY, 1896.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nA meeting of the Council was held on April 24th, at the West\nminster Town Hall. The President was in the chair, Mr. R. Pearsall\nSmith having occupied it for a few minutes until his arrival. There\nwere also present, Colonel Hartley, Professor H. Sidgwick, Dr. J.\nMilne Bramwell, Dr. C. Lockhart Robertson, and Messrs. T. Barkworth,\nP. W. H. Myers, F. Podmore, and H. Arthur Smith.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as correct.\nOne new Member and four new Associates were elected, whose\nnames and addresses are given above.\nThe election of eight new Associates of the American Branch was\nrecorded.\nIt was agreed that, at her request, the name of Mrs. Stewart\nWalker should be transferred from the list of Members to that of\nAssociates.\nA present to the Library was reported, for which a vote of thanks\nwas passed to the donor.\nThe further consideration of the report of the House and Finance\nCommittee was adjourned to the next meeting.\nVarious other matters having been discussed by the Council,\nit was agreed that its next meeting should be at 4.30, on Friday,\nJune 5th, at the Rooms of the Society.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 79th General Meeting of the Society was held at the\nWestminster Town Hall on Friday, April 24th, at 4 p.m., the\nPresident, Mr. W. Crookes, in the chair.\nMR. CROOKES explained that since his election as President of the\nSociety, his health had kept him abroad, and that even now he was not\nsufficiently well to prepare the address which he hoped to be able to\ngive later. He then stated that the paper by \" Miss X.\", announced to\nbe read at this meeting, was deferred, owing to circumstances which\nwould be fully explained when the paper was read at a future meeting,\nwhen also it was hoped that more complete evidence would be forth\ncoming on some points.\nMR. F. PODMORE read a paper on \" Poltergeists,\" or visitations of\nstone-throwing, bell-ringing, movements of furniture, and other physical\ndisturbances. Outbreaks of this kind, he pointed out, have been\noccasionally recorded from the Middle Ages down to the present time.\n\fMAT, 1896.] General Meeting. 247\nThe newspapers each year report several cases. The phenomena, as\ndescribed by apparently honest witnesses, seem often to be quite\ninexplicable by normal agencies, and are frequently regarded, by the\neye-witnesses, at any rate, as manifestations of occult power.\nRepresentatives of the Society have investigated with some care\neleven cases of the kind, the earliest of which took place in March,\n1883, at Worksop. In none of these cases was satisfactory evidence\nobtained pointing to abnormal agency. In several instances direct\nproof of trickery was received, either from the testimony of eye\nwitnesses, or from the confessions of the persons\u2014chiefly young\ngirls\u2014who were concerned in producing the manifestations. In cases\nwhere proof of either kind was wanting, it could yet fairly be inferred,\nfrom the descriptions given, from the character of the witnesses, and\nfrom the discrepancies in the various accounts, that the phenomena\nattested might be susceptible of a similar explanation. Mr. Podmore\nconcluded by suggesting that to substantiate abnormal physical agency\nin such cases, the contemporary evidence of educated witnesses to\nphenomena observed under conditions within their own control is\nessential ; and such evidence does not appear ever to have been\nobtained.\nTHE PRESIDENT thought that Mr. Podmore's paper had given them\nmuch to think of. Mr. Podmore's view seemed to imply extremely bad\nobservation on the part of the witnesses.\nME. PAGE HOPPS remarked that to him the paper suggested a\nconclusion opposite to that drawn by Mr. Podmore ; it did not follow\nthat everything was trickery because some things were. Deformed\nchildren might well wish to trick sometimes, and mediumship was often\ncombined with trickery. For instance, a medium staying in his own\nhouse, after ten days of remarkable manifestations,\u2014during which a\nPuritan divine, professing to be Isaac Watts, communicated,\u2014while\ndriving into Manchester, identified a statue of James Watt as the\nsame man. She must undoubtedly have told a lie, unless her imagina\ntion ran away with her. But immediately afterwards she gave a\ndetailed account of the death of a daughter of a man unknown to her,\ngiving the name,\u2014all she said being true.\nDR. KINGSTON observed that it would be interesting to hear from\nMr. Westlake some particulars of one of the cases referred to by Mr.\nPodmore, which he had investigated.\nMR. E. WESTLAKE gave an account of his discovery of trickery in\nthis case.\nPROFESSOR SIDGWICK said that he had investigated one of the\n\u2022cases\u2014the Wem case\u2014and had been at first inclined to think that]\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAT, 1896.\nthough there had been trickery, there were probably also some\ngenuine phenomena. The advantage of the work of >a Society like\nours was that it led to a systematic investigation and comparison of\ndifferent cases ; and he agreed with Mr. Podmore in thinking that\nsuch a comparison of these cases rendered probable the conclusion of\ntrickery throughout.\nA paper communicated by PROFESSOR W. JAMES, of Harvard, was\nthen read by Mr. P. W. H. MYERS. It was entitled \" A case of\npsychic automatism, including 'speaking with tongues';\" and contained\na remarkable autobiographical statement from a man of letters known to-\nProfessor J ames, who here assumed the nom deplume of \"Mr. le Baron.\"\nMr. le Baron, under somewhat remarkable circumstances, became sub\nject to accesses of vocal automatism, mainly in the form of what he calls\n\"deific verbiage;\"\u2014a kind of hymns and declamations which issued\nfrom his lips with a strong subjective sense of inspiration. After a\ntime these intelligible (although incoherent) utterances were succeeded\nby unintelligible utterances, claiming to be in \" unknown tongues,\" of\nwhich translations were afterwards given. \" Mr. le Baron,\" says Pro\nfessor James, \" was by no means willing to abandon the idea that hi&\nunintelligible vocal performances were involuntary reproductions of\nsome ancient or remote tongue. His earnestness and energy in seek\ning to gain corroboration for this view is the best possible proof that\nthe vocal movements carried with them for him, as he made them, no-\nsubjective feeling of being due to his personal will. He spent hours\nporing over grammars and vocabularies of African and Asiatic-\ntongues. I corresponded with various philologists on his behalf. But\nno light came, and finally he grew convinced, by the mere progress of\nthe phenomenon, that it was less important than it pretended to be.'r\nThe paper thus introduced contained a vivid account of experiences\nwhose intensity seemed for a long time an overpowering subjective\nproof of their value. Specimens of the unknown tongues, recorded by\nthe phonograph, were given.\nMR. F. W. H. MYERS made some remarks upon the case detailed in\nProfessor James' paper, of which the purport was as follows :\u2014\u2022\nMr. le Baron's experiences are of especial interest as filling a gap that\nhad remained for some time open in the symmetrical series of cases which\nshow the progress of each class of automatic verbalisation from insane\nincoherence to supernormal instructiveness. In each of the other forms\nof verbalisation the series is already pretty complete. In word-seeing\nwe start from the meaningless and terrifying words or sentences some\ntimes seen by the insane, as though written in fire, without them or\nwithin ; we pass through the stage of words seen in the crystal with\n\fMAT, 1896.] General Meeting. 249\nnothing to point to an origin external to tlie seer's mind ; and we\narrive at the supernormal phenomenon of the sight of words in the\ncrystal which convey facts previously unknown to the seer. Similarly\nin word-hearing we start from the delusions of madness, when per\nsecuting voices and the like are so often heard ; we go on to internal\nauditions of a monitory kind, which may well proceed from the auditor's\nown subliminal self ; and finally we come to those \" clairaudient \"\npremonitions which imply the possession of a wider purview than the\nautomatist himself had ever\u2014to his own supraliminal knowledge\u2014\nattained. For the third form of verbalisation,\u2014word-writing,\u2014the\ncontinuous series from insanity to inspiration is by this time still more\nfamiliar to readers of our Proceedings. In each case the gradual\ndevelopment from phenomena below into phenomena above the normal\nstandard of personality seems to show that in these special directions\nthe personality is most easily modifiable ; and that subliminal dis\nturbances, whether dissolutive or evolutive, are apt to come to the\nsurface by these as their readiest paths. It is therefore only by a\nstudy in each case of the actual messages given that we can rightly\nrank the automatist, either as insane, or as merely a person in whom\nsubliminal uprushes are unusually facile, or as a man in some sense\ninspired with fuller knowledge than other men, either by his own\nhidden spirit, or by spirits without him.\nIn the fourth form of verbalisation,\u2014word-utterance,\u2014we have\nuntil now mainly found examples of the' lowest and the highest classes.\nThe ceaseless vociferation of mania is familiar to all ; and wonder is\noften expressed at the vigour and persistency of the maniac's utterance,\n\u2014far surpassing the achievements of practised public speakers. Then\nat the other end of the scale we have the utterances which come through\nMrs. Piper, in which (as fresh evidence makes increasingly probable)\nintelligences other than Mrs. Piper's own are habitually concerned.\nBut for intermediate examples,\u2014for utterance neither insane nor in\nany true sense inspired,\u2014we have thus far had to fall back mainly on old\nrecords. Chief of these have been the accounts of the Irvingite speak\ning with tongues. Next, perhaps, comes a little-known work, \"Strange\nSermons of Rachel Baker,\" which contains two cases of sermonising\nutterance during apparently quite genuine sleep. I need not say that\n\"trance addresses\" are quite a common feature in spiritist reunions.\nIn the very few cases where I have heard these public addresses under\nsupposed inspiration, I have felt sure that the speaker was in full pos\nsession of his or her ordinary consciousness. But I think it very\nprobable that speeches may sometimes be genuinely made in a trance\nstate ;\u2014which would, of course, be no more wonderful than it is when\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAT, 1896.\na hypnotised boy at an entertainment lectures on temperance and so\nforth, and remembers nothing about it when he awakes. The trance\nmay be a mere self-hypnotisation ;\u2014and such, in the absence from\nthe speech of any facts unknown to the speaker, we are bound to\nconsider it.\nBut among all these strictly automatic vocalisations, neither\ninsane nor inspired, Mr. le Baron's case is the fullest and most instruc\ntive. I know no stronger example of the subjective sense of genius,\nor rather of positive inspiration, accompanying a subliminal uprush of\nabsolutely meaningless matter. Some of this matter, indeed, was\nmeaningless even to incoherence,\u2014consisting of \" unknown tongues,\"\nwhich are pretty certainly destined to remain unknown. One cannot\nbut note, with satisfaction at our present progress, yet with deep\nregret at the sad story of the past, the different way in which\nthese so-called tongues were treated in Irving's time and in our own.\nSeveral, at least, of the speakers with tongues in Irving's congregation\nwere, I have no doubt, perfectly sincere ; and Irving himself was, as all\nknow, a man of probity and elevation. Yet his ignorance\u2014his unavoid\nable ignorance\u2014of the phenomena of automatism landed him and his\nflock first in natural mistake, but at last in obstinate credulity, and\nspoilt the close of a noble and high career. In Mr. le Baron's case,\non the other hand, the automatist himself had the courage and candour\nto estimate his utterances in the calm light of science, in spite of strong\nsubjective inducement to continue to assign to them a value which\nthey did not possess. He had the good fortune, I need hardly add, to\nmeet with a wise and gentle adviser, and the phenomenon which, if\ndifferently treated, might have led on to the delusion of many, and\nperhaps to the insanity of one, became to the one a harmless experience,\nand to the world an acquisition of interesting psychological truth.

The case here printed rests unfortunately only on the recollection\nof the witnesses, but it appears that at the time they ascertained the\ncoincidences with care.\nThe accounts were obtained through the kindness of Mr. Lewis C.\nPowles, of 9, Queen's Gate Place, S.W., an Associate of the Society,\nwho is personally acquainted with all the witnesses. The names of\nthe percipient and her daughter, whom we will call Mrs. E. and\nMrs. A. have been given us in confidence.\nMrs. A.'s statement is enclosed in a letter from Mr. Powles written\non February 5th, 1896. She writes :\u2014\nI cannot remember the, date ; but one night two or three years ago, I\ncame back from the theatre to my mother's flat at 6, S.-street ; and\nafter I had been into her bedroom and told her all about it, I went to bed\nabout 1 a.m. I had not been asleep long when I started up frightened,\nfancying that I had heard some one walk down the passage towards my\nmother's room ; but hearing nothing more went again to sleep. I started up\nalarmed in the same way three or four times before dawn.\nIn the morning, upon inquiry, my mother (who was ill at the time) only\ntold me she had had a very disturbed night.\nThen I asked my brother, who told me that he had suffered in the same\nway as I had, starting up several times in a frightened manner. On hearing\nthis, my mother then told me that she had seen an apparition of Mr. Rose.\nLater in the day Mr. Rose came in, and my mother asked him casually if\nhe had been doing anything last night ; upon which he told us that he had\ngone to bed willing that he should visit and appear to us. We made him\npromise not to repeat the experiment.\nA night or so just before, I remember the servant came into my mother's\nbedroom, alarmed, at 3 a.m. ; she said she had heard the electric bell ring.\nThe bell at that tune of night is inaccessible to the casual passer-by, as\nthe outer door is then closed. The servant, I believe, heard it more than\nonce ; she cried and fancied it was an omen of tier mother's death.\nMrs. E. writes :\u2014\nFebruary 12th, 1896.\nThough unable to give the date of these strange incidents which I have\nexperienced, yet I will try and be as exact as possible in my relation. I\nhave not, I think, forgotten any detail, for all is still impressed very vividly\nupon my memory.\nThe first occasion 1 had been ill and my daughter had come to stay with\nme. I was better and had been up, when on this particular night\u2014she was\nsharing my bed\u2014we were both so restless that neither could sleep. We\nmade various apologies the one to the other, both saying we could not tel\nwhat was the matter, but both agreeing as to having most uncomfortable\nsensations.\nThen suddenly came a banging at my door and my maid's voice asking\nwhat was the matter. On letting her in, she told us that my bell, which rung\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAT, 1896.\njust outside her bedroom door, had rung over and over again, that it had\nwakened her, that she waited before getting up till it rang again and again.\nWhen I told her I had not rung it, she burst out crying, saying, \" Oh,\nthen my mother must be dead and it's a warning.\" (She went next day and\nfound her mother quite well). I mention her remark to show that she\nmust have felt there was something uncanny.\nI must now explain about this bell. There was none actually in my\nroom, but outside my door was an electric bell and to this was fastened a long\nelectric rope which could be carried from room to room , and each night was\nplaced by my bedside. The bell could only be rung by the button being\npressed which was at the end of the rope on the table beside my bed.\nOn the Sunday evening after this, some friends were supping with me (my\ndaughter had returned home), and before we had finished Mr. Rose came in.\nHe drew a chair to the table and my son said, \" Well, Rose, what have you\nbeen doing lately ? \" His reply startled me, for he answered, \" My last effort\nhas been trying to send my ' spook ' here. \" I asked him to explain what he\nmeant and then he told me about it. It was the first time I had heard that\nsuch a thing was possible, and I then told him of the ringing of the bell on\nthat same evening.\nThis subject was not discussed again by us as far as I can recollect, nor\ndid it impress me particularly ; and some weeks* passed, when I was struck\ndown with a bad attack of influenza, and again my daughter came to nurse\nme.\nI had quite recovered, but had not yet been out of my room, but was to\ngo into the drawing-room next day. On this particular night, my daughter\nhad gone to the theatre and my son remained with me. He had bid me good\nnight about half-past ten and gone to his room, and I lay reading, when\nsuddenly a strange creepy sensation came over me, and I felt my eyes drawn\ntowards the left hand side of the room. I felt I must look, and there distinct\nagainst the curtain was a blue luminous mist.\nI could not for some time move my eyes away, and all the time I was\nreally terrified, for I thought it was something uncanny. I wished to call\nmy son, but fought down the feeling, knowing I should only upset him if\nhe thought I was nervous, and possibly they would think I was going to be\nill again. So I battled down my fears, and making up my mind it was all\nimagination, turned round with my back to this misty light and continued\nmy book. Soon the feoling of fear passed away ; but all desire for sleep\nhad also gone, and for a long time I lay reading,\u2014when again quite suddenly\ncame the dread and the feeling of awe.\nThis time I was impelled to cast my eyes downward to the side of my\nbed, and there, creeping upwards towards me, was the same blue luminous\nmist. I was too terrified to move, and remember keeping my book straight\nup before my face as though to ward off a blow, at the same time exerting\n* Mrs. A., whohaB just read this, seems to think now that the two occurrences\nwere separated by some weeks, not days as she wrote in her statement.\u2014L.

I dropped my book with an exclamation\nnot complimentary, for then I knew that Mr. Rose had been trying the same\nthing again. In one moment mist and face were gone.\nNext morning I told my daughter, and she said she had had the same\nrestless night (though sleeping in another room) as when the bells rang and\nwe had both felt as if something uncanny were in the room.\nThat day Mr. Rose came to see me, and before telling him anything of my\nexperience, I asked him what he had been doing the night before. His\nanswer was, \"I went to my room early and concentrated all my thoughts in\ntrying to send my astral body here. \"\nI then repeated to him what I have written here, and Mr. Rose promised\nhe would not experiment on me again, as it made me nervous.\nThe agent's account of his side of the incident is contained in a\nletter to Mr. Powles, as follows :\u2014\n4, Cromwell Crescent, S.W. January 18th, 1896.\nDEAR Mu. POWLES,\u2014The evidence I have to give in the case of \"spirit\nprojection\" is very little by itself; but as you have heard the story and will\nhave the evidence of Mrs. E. and Mrs. A., I shall confine myself to that\nwhich comes within my own knowledge. As an author (having written\n.several novels) I am, of course, somewhat imaginative, though I incline\nrather to the realistic than to the romantic school. 1 have also read and\ntaken much interest in so-called occult phenomena. I should also mention\nthat I had mesmerised Mrs. E. with more or less success on several occasions\nbefore making the experiment I am going to relate.\nHaving read of cases of spirit projection, I resolved, without mentioning\nthe fact to any one, to endeavour to send my astral body to Mrs. E. It was\nabout 1891 or 1892,though my memory for dates is so bad that I can't be\ncertain as to the time. This will no doubt be fixed by others. I sat in my\nbedroom about half past twelve or one o'clock and fixed my will upon the\nenterprise I had been considering. I carefully imagined myself going down\nthe steps of this house, walking along the streets, arriving at S.-street,\nmounting to Mrs. E. 's flat and going to her drawing-room and bedroom. I\nthen went to bed with my mind fixed upon the visit I wished to make, and\nsoon fell asleep.\nThe next evening I called on Mrs. E., and found her with Mr. and Mrs.\nA. and some other persons just finishing dinner. I asked her if anything un\nusual had occurred on the previous night. She and Mrs. A. told me they had\nbeen disturbed, that the servant had heard a bell ring and had come to them\nin the night, etc., etc. ; but I here leave the narrative to them, only mention\ning that I believe it was an electric bell which the servant heard.\nThe next night I repeated the experiment, and when I saw them again,\nthey told me of its success and begged me never to repeat it, as both Mrs. A.\nand Mrs. E. had been very much frightened,\u2014the former by the feeling that\n.some one was in the room, and the latter by actually seeing the upper part\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1896,\nof my face over the top of a book which she was reading. I personally was\nnot in any way conscious of the success of my attempt, for, so far as I\nremember, I did not even dream about any of the family. I have since tried\nthis experiment with other people, but without success. I have never again\ntried it with Mrs. E. nor with her daughter.\nI am afraid this is a very inconclusive narrative when taken by itself, but\nit is all that is absolutely within my own knowledge. When, however, it is\ntaken in connection with what the two ladies felt and saw, it is not without\ninterest.\u2014Yours sincerely,\nFRED. W. ROSE.\nIn answer to some questions from Mr. Powles, Mr. Rose wrote :\u2014\nJanuary 21st, 1896.\nIn reply to your note, I did not after my first experiment give notice that\nI intended to nuike another. I had tried to mesmerise Mrs. A. when she\nsuffered from neuralgia, but without success. I feel sure I did not try her\nmore than twice, and I had not done so for a long time before the experi\nments. I did not try hypnotism upon any other occupant of the house.\nIn answer to our further enquiries about the interval between\nthe two experiments, Mr. Rose explained that by the phrase\u2014\u2022\n\" The next night I repeated the experiment \"\u2014he did not mean that\nthe two experiments occurred on consecutive nights. He says, \"I\ncan't now remember what time elapsed between the two experiments,\nbut I think it was some two or three weeks.\" The fact of there\nhaving been some interval between the two trials tells against the\nsupposition that Mrs. E.'s second impression was a mere subjective\nrecrudescence of the first, accidentally coinciding with Mr. Rose's\nsecond attempt.\nSince writing his account, Mr. Rose made two more attempts to\nappear to Mrs. E., who was in the south of France at the time. Mrs.\nE. tells us that on two nights during this period she was wakened\nsuddenly by the feeling that some one was in the room, and was much\nalarmed. On the second occasion it occurred to her that Mr. Rose was\nperhaps trying an experiment on her. She wrote shortly after to ask\nhim if this was the case; but unfortunately neither of them had noted'\nthe dates, Mr. Rose feeling sure that when Mrs. E. was in a part of\nFrance that was unknown to him, he would not succeed. It is obvious,\ntherefore, that no stress can be laid on these later experiments, and\nMr. Rose tells us that a third trial, made on February 8th, 1896, was\na complete failure.\nIt must also be observed that Mrs. E., as a child, had two\nexperiences of apparently subjective hallucinations, one of which was\nvisual. These, however, can hardly be held to detract from the\n\fMAT, 1896.] Cases. 255\nsignificance of the incidents described above, and in such experiments,\none success out of only five trials seems a large proportion.\nL. 1077.

Taylor visited the witnesses on February 4th, 1896,\nand obtained from them the following statements.\n(1)\nMr. F. Staines, of Abbey Street, Rugby, states :\u2014\nFebruary 15th, 1896.\nBefore I was married, some 15 years ago, I was living in Rugby. My\npresent wife, to whom I was then engaged, and whose name was Jane\nLouisa Cox, was living hi Oxford as cook in the family of Mr. Arthur\nSidgwick. One Sunday night I was lying awake in bed, with no reason to\nbelieve that any harm was likely to happen to my fiancee, or that she was\nunwell.\nIt must have been about 11 o'clock when I was startled to see her stand\ning at the foot of my bed in her night dress and her hair down about her\nshoulders. She was looking at me in an attitude as if imploring help. The\nphantasm remained for about half a minute and then, slowly gliding towards\nthe window on my left, disappeared.\nI am sure I was not asleep when the figure appeared. I was much\nimpressed and slept little for the rest of the night. It was Miss Cox's\ncustom to write to me every Sunday afternoon, so that I got her letter by the\nfirst post on Monday. On the Monday after I saw the phantasm, I got no\nletter by the usual post. This made me feel uneasy, so I wrote off at once\nsaying what I had seen and asking if anything was the matter. My letter\ncrossed one to me from Miss M., a fellow-servant of Jane Cox, telling me\nthat she had been taken ill the night before and, not being able to write her\nself as usual, had got her to do so.\nI told Dr. Duke at the time what I had experienced.\nFREDERICK JOHN STAINES.\n(2)\nMrs. Staines states :- February 15th, 1896.\nFifteen years ago, I was in service as cook to Mrs. Sidgwick, in Oxford,\nand was engaged to a young man, Frederick Staines, who was living at the\ntune in Rugby. I had over-worked myself, I think, for one Sunday after\nnoon I was taken ill while attending service at the cathedral. I went home\nto bed feeling very ill indeed, and at about 9.30 remembered that I had not\nwritten the letter I was accustomed to do every Sunday evening to Fred\nStaines. I began to feel worse and thought I was going to die, so I struggled\nout of bed to write my last letter to him and to my mother. I remember\nthat I got up and stood at the foot of my bed in my night dress. Miss M.,\nwho was nurse in the family and who was looking after me, insisted that I\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY, 1896.\nshould return to bed and that she would write the letters for me. She had\nnot finished them till between 10 and 11 p.m., when it was too late to post\nthem that night. I made her write how ill I was and how unable to write\nmyself. At about 4 p.m. on Monday, I got a letter from Mr. Staines hoping\nthat I was not ill, for he had had a most peculiar dream. \" Still it was not\na dream,\" he wrote, \" for I was awake at the time.\" He said he had seen me\nat the foot of his bed, standing in my night dress with my hair down, in an\nattitude as if I was imploring him to come and help me. I had my hair\ndown when I got out of bed to write the letters.\nThat same night my mother dreamed that I was ill, and I had a letter to\nsay so from a friend of hers. My mother was not well enough to write her\nself. My mother's sensations were that she wanted to come to me and I to\nher, but we could not.\nI have never had another experience like the above, but my father once\nsaw the vision of a friend at the moment of death.\nJANE LOUISA STAINES.\nDr. Duke writes :\u2014\n33, Bilton-road, Rugby, March 8th, 1896.\nI remember that Fred Staines told me, at the time, of his having seen the\nphantasm of Miss Cox at his bedside when she was at Oxford and he at\nRugby. THOMAS DUKE.\nIn answer to Colonel Taylor's enquiries, Mrs. Staines' former\nfellow-servant, who prefers that her name should not be printed,\nwrote to him :\u2014\nOxford, February 10ft, [1896.]\nMY DBAS. SIR,\u2014I remember quite well the incident you refer to, viz.,\nthe temporary illness of Mrs. Staines when she was in Oxford. It is nearly\n16 years ago, or a little more. When I say I remember the incident, I mean\nmore especially her i1lness, the day and time of evening I spent in trying to\nrelieve her and carrying out directions given me by a doctor some time\nbefore,\u2014before we left Rugby, in fact. She was in the habit of having a letter\n\u2022every Monday morning from Mr. Staines. When she did not, she nearly\nalways concluded that he had been for a long walk with a friend, so missed\nthe post which would ensure delivery here on Monday morning early. In\nthis case, she generally received his by our second post. On this Sunday she\nhad been out, and for longer than usual. She came in from evening church\ncomplaining of pains of a spasmodic character, and after some time of trying\nremedies I said, \"Now you must have a hot bath,\" and began to prepare it\nin her room. She was in great pain and leant her arms on the chest of\ndrawers and as far as she could her body too. Mr. Staines' photo, was on\nthe drawers, and of course we noticed it ; while 1 was busy, it seemed to me\nshe talked either of or to him by this means. I know she said once or twice,\n\" Oh, Fred ! \" Well, then, my remedial measures having taken effect, I left\nher to go to sleep and told her not to get up in the morning, we would\nmanage. What I cannot be absolutely certain of is whether any letter came\nduring the Monday which followed ; but my strong impression is that none\ndid, but that I wrote on Monday to Mr. Staines, and his crossed, I suppose. I\n\fMAT, 1896.] Cases. 257\nwrote purposely to tell him of her illness; therefore, he did not know of it at\nthe time he wrote, and I think that he told her how unhappy he had been\nbecause of having seen her and thinking something was the matter. I\ncannot remember what I wrote to him, but of course it would relate chiefly\nto her illness, and I think I must have read his letter to her in which he told\nher of the visitation. Now and then she asked me to look at his letters, or a\npart, and it is most probable that she gave me that one to read, as we were\nso interested to find he had seen her at the very time she had been leaning\non the drawers and naturally fixing her thoughts upon him. I remember\nnothing about her mother in connection with this. My letter would be\nposted to him on Monday, I think.\nOne thing I should like to say is that whatever account Mrs. Staines has\ngiven you of this may be relied upon as being absolutely true. She possesses\nin an unusual degree the gift of telling a story time after time, and at long,\nintervals, without additions or variations. I and others have frequently been\nconvinced of this, so that whatever she has told you is just as it occurred.\nI hope my account may be of use to you. I can remember nothing more, but\nwas much impressed at the time with the fact that this had been so, and she\nalluded to the time during which she was looking fixedly at the photo, as the\nvery worst of it ; indeed, she said, \" Oh, I'm sure I shall die ! \" I can only\nsay that she looked as [if] she was in great agony.\nI have, to the best of my memory, only spoken to her of this four or five\ntimes since.\n(Signed)\nColonel Taylor writes that his interviews with. Mr. and Mrs,\nStaines gave him the impression that they were honest witnesses and\nthat their statements might be relied on as accurate. He found that\nthey had, unfortunately, not kept the letters which passed between\nthem on the occasion.\nMrs. Arthur Sidgwick thinks that she was not told of the incident\nat the time, but after reading the account of it, she writes :\u2014\nThis all sounds correct, and I know my old cook and nurse to be perfectly\nreliable witnesses. I cannot remember the exact occasion, but well remem\nber Jane's frequent illnesses of the kind.\nC. S. SIDGWICK.\nL. 1078.

Martratt, residing at 21, Grand-street, in the city of Albany,\nN.Y., makes the following statements :\u2014\nIn June, 1885 (the exact day is not remembered), I went to bed one\nevening about 9 o'clock. About an hour afterward, I was awakened from\nsleep by my wife, who said, \" Charlie, granny has been here, and she spoke\nto me. She said to me ' Ellen, I am dead, but don't be afraid. When you\ncome to the funeral, look at the left side of the back part of my head, and\nyou will see the cause of my death.\" Granny stood at the foot of the bed,\nwith a night-cap on.\" My wife said that when she had spoken to her she\ndisappeared.\nThe next morning about 8 o'clock a.m., a telegram came, saying that the\nold lady was dead. My wife took the earliest possible train to the nearest\nrailway station to where her grandmother had lived, which was Gansvoort\n{near Fort Edward, New York), and then rode some five miles into the\n\u2022country to the house where she had died. The old lady had not been put\nin her coffin yet, and lay in the front parlour with a night-cap still on her\nhead. My wife said that she went and raised the night-cap and examined the\nhead of the corpse, and found a large bump or bruise on the back of the head.\nThe place where the old lady died was about 50 miles from where we\nlived. She and my wife had mutually promised each other that the one\nwho died first would come back and see the survivor, if possible.\nThe same summer, about a month later, my wife had another similar\nexperience. She was sitting in a room sewing, and noticed a shadow at the\ndoor. On looking up, she saw my brother Matthew standing before her.\nShe said, \"Why, Mat, what are you doing here? I thought you were\nsick.\" She arose to get a chair, but when she turned toward him, he was\ngone. She looked up and down the street, but could find no trace of him.\nOn my return in the evening, she told me what had happened, and expressed\na fear that my brother was dead. The next morning a telegram came, saying\nthat my brother had died the previous day at about the hour in which she\nsaw the vision. He died about ten miles distant.\nDuring the fall of 1888, in the month of October, I was absent from my\nhome in Albany. 1 was .in Buffalo, New York, which is about 400 miles\nfrom my home. On returning, after an absence of about two months, my\nwife surprised me by informing me of where I had been and what I had done\nnearly every day while I was away. She was very correct in her informa\ntion, which was derived wholly by some sort of clairvoyant power. She\ntold me the hour at which I took trains for various places, and met me at\nthe depot on my return, although I had written her that I should be home\naeveral days later.\nCHARLES E.

Arthur Smith.\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1896.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as correct.\nFive new Associates were elected, whose names and addresses are\ngiven above.\nThe election of one new Member and five new Associates of the\nAmerican Branch was recorded.\nThe report of the House and Finance Committee received further\nconsideration. A unanimous opinion was expressed that the recom\nmendations contained in the report were reasonable, and should be\naccepted, and that definite action should be taken in regard to them at\nthe next meeting of the Council.\nVarious other matters having been discussed, it was agreed that\nthe next meeting of the Council should be on Friday, July 10th, at\n3 p.m., at the Westminster Town Hall, previous to the General\nMeeting arranged for that day.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 80th General Meeting of the Society was held at the\nWestminster Town Hall on Friday, June 5th, at 8.30 p.m., Professor\nBarrett in the chair.\nDR. J. MILNE BRAMWELL read a paper on \" Personally observed\nHypnotic Phenomena.\" He stated that he had never been able to\ninduce hypnosis by mechanical means alone, and that the mentally ill-\nbalanced were the most difficult to hypnotise.\nCases were cited in which important changes in the involuntary\nmuscles and special senses had been produced by suggestion. In one\ninstance, where a remarkable improvement in vision was observed,\nthis was shown to be due to the removal of long-standing ciliary\nspasm.\nDr. Bramwell gave an account of 55 experiments showing the\npower of somnambules in appreciating time. The method employed\nwas to suggest to the subject, when asleep, that she should carry\nout a simple act at the expiration of a certain number of minutes.\nDespite the fact that the patient on awaking had no recollection of\nthese suggestions, all, with the exception of two, were carried out\ncorrectly.\nInstances were given of suggested improvement in memory, both as\nregards recent and remote events.\nAs far as his experience went, Dr. Bramwell claimed that hypno\ntised subjects possessed the power of resisting the operator when his\ncommands were distasteful to them. In illustration of this, he gave\n\fJUNE, 1896.] General Meeting. 263\nthe history of some deeply hypnotised patients who had refused to\ncarry out certain suggestions and also gave an account of their mental\ncondition, as revealed by questioning them in hypnosis.\nThe curative influence of suggestion in disease was referred to\nbriefly, and Dr. Bramwell stated that he had been able to confirm\nmany of the observations on this subject reported from abroad.\nIn conclusion Dr. Bramwell again insisted that he had seen no\nevidence of the so-called automatism of the hypnotised subject and\nconsidered that the power of resisting the commands of the operator\nwas second in importance to none of the phenomena of induced\nsomnambulism.\nMR. J. ENMOEE JONES asked what was Dr. Bramwel1's method of\ninducing hypnosis, and whether he made use of mesmeric passes ? He\nstated that his own experience as a mesmeriser some half century ago\nhad led him to believe that such passes exerted a real influence.\nDR. BRAMWELL replied that he usually employed verbal suggestion\nalone, and that passes were unnecessary.\nME. F. W. H. MYERS asked Dr. Bramwell whether in his opinion\nthe mechanism by which he had described an improvement of sight as\neffected after hypnotic suggestion was applicable to all the recorded\ncases of improvement of sight by suggestion. The relaxation of a\nciliary spasm, which habitually over-corrected hypermetropia, seemed a\nnatural and easy result of suggestion. But would this explain such a\ncase as that recorded some years ago by Dr. Bergson, of cornea-reading,\nwhere the hypnotised subject distinguished reflected letters so minute\nas to raise the anatomical question of the minimum visibile 1 The\nspeaker went on to remark on the extreme rarity at the present\nmoment of hypnotic experiments undertaken with purely scientific\nends, and he congratulated Dr. Bramwell on having been able to make\nso many and such interesting experiments in the course of therapeutic\npractice.\nDE. BRAMWELL replied that it was probable that similar physical\nconditions existed in some of the cases referred to by Mr. Myers.\nSlight hypermetropia was not uncommon and was likely to be over-\ncorrected by ciliary spasm in neurotic subjects. On the other hand,\nalterations in the attention and circulation might play a part in these\nchanges.\nDR. ABRAHAM WALLACE asked whether any of the patients on\nwhom the post-hypnotic time-experiments had been tried had ever\nexperienced headache in consequence.\nDR. BRAMWELL replied that he had never observed a single case\nwhere the employment of hypnotism, either in medicine or in scientific\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNK, 1896.\nresearch, had produced even trivial ill effect or discomfort. When the\npatient in question came to him she had been gravely ill, and under\nmedical treatment, for about twelve months. She was suffering from\nmuscular tremor of the extremities, headaches, neuralgia, etc., and was\nunable to walk across the room without pain. All these symptoms had\ndisappeared under hypnotic treatment and, on more than one occasion\nrecently, she had ridden a heavy old-fashioned tricycle over 50 miles\na day without fatigue.\nDR. H . D. R. KINGSTON said he would like to draw attention to\none point mentioned by Dr. Bramwell in his interesting paper, as he\nconsidered that it required to be emphasised to those who were still\nafraid of hypnotism from knowing but little about it ; this was that\nthe hypnotic state did not upset the moral balance and that, as in\nthe experiment described, the subjects would refuse to do, when in\nthat state, anything which they would think wrong in their normal\ncondition.\nHe was able to confirm this from his own experience, and was\ninclined to believe that the natural effect of hypnotism was to increase\nthe moral sense, just as the physical senses were rendered more acute\nby its action. His own observations were made, not on a civilised and\nmorally refined subject, but on a little South African coloured boy\nwhom one would not suppose to be particularly scrupulous at any time,\nand who, moreover, was in such an entirely automatic state that he\nnever either spoke or moved without the Doctor's finger upon his\ntemple. (This, by the way, was a phenomenon entirely normal to the\ncase and in no way due to suggestion, as it was discovered by accident\nand was quite contrary to the Doctor's expectation and intention).\nWhen in this very marked somnambulic or automatic state (which\ncould, after the first time, be instantly induced by a look and a word,\nor a pass) he would speak, sing, or perform any action directed, unless\nit was one which he thought wrong, or did not wish to execute. The\nrefusals were, moreover, always unexpected by the Doctor, who did not\nintroduce orders of a doubtful character by way of experiment and\nwho had, therefore, no hesitation or mental reserve in giving the order.\nOn one occasion, for instance, he was told to smoke a cigarette, but\nrefused, and gave as his reason that his brother would scold him ; on\nanother to kiss the cook, and again to pull a young lady's hair, but he\ndeclined from feelings evidently of shyness and respect. The latter\nwas curiously shown one day when he was met on the beach carrying\na string of fish, and being hypnotised, was told to give a fish to a young\nlady present. With eyes fast shut, and, as usual, acting only when the\nhypnotiser's finger was on his temple, he quite unexpectedly proceeded\n\fJUNK, 1896.] General Meeting. 265\nto feel over and examine the string of fishes, and carefully selected the\nlargest and best before offering it.\nThese instances, small as they were, Dr. Kingston thought indicated\nthe state of the moral sensibility and the natural reaction of the mind\nto impressions received when in the hypnotic state.\nMR. ROBINSON asked whether any of the subjects who had shown\nthis power of post-hypnotic computation of time had had any other\nexperiences which could suggest the hypothesis that those hidden\ncomputations were assisted by any mind external to themselves.\nDR. BRAMWELL replied that in none of the cases of which he had\nspoken had there been any phenomena pointing in that direction.\nMR. WALTER LEAF suggested that automatic writing might, as in\none of Mol1's experiments, be successful in extracting information as\nto the deeper hypnotic consciousness when the patient could give no\ninformation verbally. He also asked whether any information could\nbe given about the synchronism of the clocks used in timing the\nexperiments. When a number of minutes were to be reckoned from\nthe clock in Dr. Bramwel1's room, and were exactly computed as\nchecked by another clock in the patient's home, it would seem, in view\nof the great improbability of the exact accordance of both clocks, that\nthe due time must have been calculated out (rather than counted\ncontinuously) and timed by the clock used to check it. He thought it\nwould increase the value of the test if, when the suggestions were\nmade, the patient were not told the actual time.\nDR. BRAMWELL replied that sometimes as many as six suggestions,\neach representing an interval of many thousand minutes, were given\nat once, and that these started from different imaginary times. In\naddition, many of the experiments were fulfilled when the patient had\nbeen asleep for several hours in his presence and in that of other\nobservers. On these occasions, she could not consult the time, as the\nonly clock in the room had not been going for three years.\nSIR CHARLES ELLIOT asked whether the improvements in sight and\nhearing of which Dr. Bramwell had spoken as caused by suggestion had\nbeen permanent.\nDR. BRAMWELL replied that in one instance where hypersesthesia of\nhearing had been produced, in a subject suffering from partial deafness,\nthis had persisted for several years. The improvement in the range of\nvision was fully maintained, according to an independent observer, at\nthe end of twelve months.\nTHE CHAIRMAN remarked that it was most satisfactory to be\nassured, as the result of Dr. Bramwel1's wide experience, that no evils\nof any kind need be apprehended from hypnotic treatment under\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNK, 1896.\ntrustworthy medical care. He was sure, however, that Dr. Bramwell\nagreed that hypnotism was not a thing to be played with by irresponsible\npersons, or without a genuine therapeutic or scientific purpose. To this\nDr. BramweM signified cordial assent.\nCASES.\nL. 1080. Impressions.\nThe following are instances of apparently clairvoyant impres\nsions occurring during severe illness, and recorded by the medical\nman in attendance. It is difficult or impossible to say whether\nthe morbid condition really facilitated the impressions, or whether,\nas some clairvoyants are strongly of opinion, good health is the\nmost favourable condition for the exercise of the faculty. And it\nmust, of course, be remembered that there is more scope for chance\ncoincidences of the vision with the reality during a state in which\nhallucinations, or at least delusions, are frequent.\nThe account is given by Dr. P. C. Sutphin, who writes to Dr.\nHodgson :\u2014\nGlasgow, Ky., October 19th, 1891.\nDEAR DR. HODGSON, \u2014In corresponding with you in regard to young\nMr. Taylor, our Glasgow (Ky. ) mind-reader, I took occasion at one time in\nthat correspondence to give you in brief the details of two cases of supposed\nclairvoyance, in highly diseased conditions, that came under my professional\nnotice some years ago. As you ask me to furnish you a fuller and more\ndetailed statement of these cases, I cheerfully comply with your request, and\nherewith send you the following facts in regard to them.\nThe first case named to you was that of Mrs. Short, aged 40 years, a\nhighly respectable widow lady of Hart Co., Ky. In the autumn of 1874, she\nwas taken with typhoid fever, and was waited on several weeks for that\ndisease by Dr. Donan, a well educated and highly successful and popular\npractitioner, who lived (and still lives) at Three Springs, a small village, with\npost-office, some four miles distant from here. The case proving intractable\nand finally becoming hopeless, Dr. D. withdrew from it, when I, who then\nlived seven miles off, was sent for. I found Mrs. S., as I expected to find\nher, in a very bad condition, though with enough vitality of system, seemingly,\nto enable her to hold out for some days at least. She suffered from insomnia ;\nfor which, however, she would let me do but little, as she said that she was\nalready dead and physic wouldn't now do her any good. Handing her some\nmedicine one day, she attempted to throw it back in my face, indignantly\nsaying that I ought to have had more sense than to try to give it to her,\nwhen I knew she was dead. She talked incessantly ; her conversation being\naltogether on what, in commonplace language, would be called the\n\"nonsensical.\" Sometimes she sang; usually improvising her own verse.\n\fJONE, 1896.] Cases. 267\nShe knew those who were attending to her and all acquaintances that came\nin to see her. With much trouble about the brain, there was an intensely\nexcited condition of the nervous system. All this, however, is not unusual\nin typhoid fever ; at least I have not unfrequently seen it in cases that I have\nwaited on ; and I only mention it to show the more especial condition of her\nmind whilst I was attending her. Being on a visit to her one day, I heard\nher say that a sister of hers, living in the State of Missouri, several hundred\nmiles distant, had gotten well, but that one of her children that she named\nhad died \"last Thursday.\" In the meantime, a letter had recently been\nreceived by the family from Mr. Hawks, the husband of the sister, stating\nthat his wife was seriously ill with probably \"chills and fever,\" but that the\nrest of the family were well. Mrs. Short died in a day or two after her\nremark about her sister and the child, and soon after her death, a letter was\nreceived from the sister, saying that she had recovered from her sickness,\nbut that one of her children had died ; naming the same child and the same\nday it died on, that Mrs. S. had named. It is proper to say that she had\nheard of her sister's illness through the letter first named, but that neither\nshe nor the family had had any intelligence as to her recovery or the death\nof the child, until the second letter came. PCS\nGlasgow, Ky., October 19ft, 1891.\nDEAR DR. HODGSON, . . .\u2014In stating this case, it would be difficult,\nin the highly diseased condition present, to say as to the value to be attached\nto it as indicating clairvoyance\u2014whether the thought as to the sister and\nchild was not the product of the imagination, and the fact of the one\nhaving recovered her health and the other having died was not \"mere\ncoincidence ; \" or whether the psychical condition was not such, really, as to\nthrow the mind en rapport with the Missouri home of the sister, leading thus\nto an actual perception and knowledge of the facts stated. Leaving this for\nothers better versed in these subjects than myself to determine, I come\nnext to\nCase 2. Mrs. Kate Overfelt, set. 65, mother of Mrs. Short. Lived\n[within] 200 yards of the latter. Was taken with typhoid fever soon after\nher daughter died. Sick some six weeks. Recovery. Died of pneumonia in\n1882. I waited on her in both attacks. Her typhoid attack was character\nised, in the way of head symptoms, by a somnolent state throughout, up to\nconvalescence. No delirium or wandering of the mind or talking in her\nsleep. When aroused, fully \"at herself.\" It was probably in the third or\nfourth week of her illness that I aroused her one day, when, after a little,\nshe said, \"Doctor, did I dream it or did I see it ? I thought I saw Fielding\nHawks and his family come through Shakertown yesterday at twelve o'clock\nin a covered wagon.\" I jocularly replied that I presumed that must have\nbeen a dream, as I did not know of any one that could see a distance of some\n65 miles through the walls of a house. \" Well, it may have been a dream,\"\nshe said, \"though it looked as plain as if I saw it.\" I thought no more of\nthis until a few days afterwards, when I learned that Mr. Hawks,\u2014before\nmentioned in this, and the son-in-law of Mrs. O.,\u2014had returned to Kentucky\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, [JUNK, 1896.\nfrom Missouri, with his family, intending to make Kentucky his home again.\nSeeing Mr. H. at Mrs. O.'s in a short time, I learned from him that he and\nhis wife \"took a notion, all at once, to come back to Kentucky,\" and as\nmoney was scarce and they had a \" team,\" they concluded to come back as\nthey went out, that is, in a waggon. He nor any of his family had written\nas to his returning, as he thought it unnecessary to write, and besides,\nwanted to take the family \" on surprise.\" They were more desirous of\nreturning, owing to the death of Mrs. S. and the illness of Mrs. O. Upon\nenquiry I was told by Mr. H.,who, I learn, now resides in Missouri again, that\nhe passed through Shakertown on the day and (as he examined his watch to\nsee the time of day) at the precise hour named by Mrs. Overfelt.\nIn this case, again, it would be difficult to say what part the diseased and\ncongested condition of the brain played in the matter, \u2014whether the whole\nwas the \"mere dream\" with its accompanying coincidence, or what the\nexplanation of the phenomena presented in the case was, though it is most\nprobable that in both this and Mrs. Short's case there was true clair\nvoyance, superinduced by the diseased conditions present It\nis probable that if physicians generally were cons ulted on this subject,\nvery many cases could be obtained illustrative of this fact. It may be, in\nfact, that clairvoyance itself is an abnormal, or more or less diseased,\ncondition of the brain or nervous system, congenital or otherwise, and thus\nit would not be remarkable that it could be excited into action, where it\nexisted in a latent form in certain cases, by certain diseases acting as highly\nexciting causes.\nBut this will be sufficient for the present on this subject, as I do not\nthink it necessary to go into any in extenso details of these cases. It is\nproper to remark that, in the end, I waited on Mis. O. , five of her children\nand one grandchild, for typhoid fever, but only in the two cases named was\nthere any clairvoyance.\nLiving 22 miles now from my former location in Hart Co., I am not now\nable to confer personally with those who I think may have been present\nwhen Mrs. S. and Mrs. 0. made the remarks just alluded to, but have\nrecently written to Mr. J. W. Poynter, Three Springs P. O., Hart Co., Ky.,\nin regard to the matter, and he has kindly permitted me to give both him\nand his wife as references in the case. Mr. Poynter is a son-in-law of\nMrs. O. and writes me that he was \"present when both conversations\noccurred,\" and is well acquainted with the facts as stated by me. In the\ninterim Mr. Hawks, I understand, now lives in Mo., but I do not know\nhis P. O. ., ,, c.\nP. C. SUTPHIN.\nIn answer to Dr. Hodgson's request for corroborative testimony,\nDr. Sutphin writes :\u2014\nGlasgow, Ky., November Wth, 1891.\nDEAR DOCTOR, . . .\u2014I presume I could get the address of Mr.\nHawks for you, though he could say nothing as to the matter, of his own\nknowledge, save that he came through \" Shakertown \" (South Union) on the\n\fJUNE, 1896.] Cases. 269\nday referred to by me. As the cases named to you, whilst interesting, never\ntheless carry no especial importance with them, I trust you will be satisfied\nwith what Mr. Poynter and his wife may say about them, if you have written\nto them,\u2014as both stand very high in their community and probably know more\nabout the cases than any one else except myself. An old hired nurse, who\nwas with Mrs. Short, I think was present when she made the remarks\nmentioned to you, but I think she is dead. A granddaughter, I think, heard\nMrs. Overfelt say what she did, but she died also six or eight years ago. If\nI had time, I could go to the neighbourhood and probably find others who\nwere familar with the circumstances, and I will go if you exact it, though I\nhope that what I have said and what Mr. P. and wife may say will be\nsatisfactory, as I haven't time really to leave home just now, and don't know\nwhom to write to in regard to them. I supposed Mr. P. and wife were\nfamiliar with them, as they were with the family all the time whilst they\nwere sick. Others were there a good deal, but I do not now recollect who of\nthem were there at the times referred to. p Q gUTPH\u2122\nDr. Hodgson wrote to Mr. Poynter and received the following\nreply :\u2014-\nThree Springs, Ky., December 29th, 1891.\nDR. R. HODGSON,\u2014DEAR SIR,\u2014Owing to sickness in my family, I have\nnot been able to reply to your letter until this date. Dr. Sutphin has\ninformed me what he wrote you in regard to the cases of Mrs. Short and\nMrs. Overfelt. I am a son-in-law of Mrs. Overfelt, and was much both\nwith her and Mrs. Short during her illness. I heard Mrs. Short in presence\nof Dr. Sutphin and some others say that her sister in Mo., Mrs. Hawks, was\nwell, but that one of her children was dead. I also knew that Mrs. Hawks\nhad been reported by letter as being dangerously sick while the rest of the\nfamily were said to have been well. This was the only letter which had\nbeen received from Mr. Hawks' family in regard to Mrs. Hawks' health\nbefore Mrs. Short's remarks as just stated. Soon after Mrs. Short's death,\nanother letter came in from the family stating that Mrs. Hawks had\nrecovered, but that one of her children (the one named by Mrs. Short) had\ndied on a certain day, also named by Mrs. Short.\nI was also present when Mrs. Overfelt remarked to Dr. Sutphin that she\neither dreamed or saw her son-in-law, Mr. Fielding Hawks, come through\nShakertown yesterday with his family about noon in a wagon. I was\ninformed by Mr. Hawks, who came in soon, that he did pass there with his\nfamily in a wagon at the hour named by Mrs. Overfelt. It is proper\nto say that neither Mrs. Overfelt nor any of the family had been\nnotified of Mr. Hawks' intention of moving back to Kentucky.\nHoping that this may be satisfactory to you, 1 have the honour to be very\nrespectfully, J w pOYNTEK\nI am the daughter of Mrs. Short, and was present when the remarks of\nMrs. Overfelt and Mrs. Short [were] made as stated by Mr. Poynter. [I]\nfully corroborate all that Mr. Poynter has said in regard to the case.\nALICE B. MEADOWS.\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNE, 1896.\nMy wife was not present on the occasion on account of inability, but\nshe is familiar with the facts from hearsay. She is a daughter of Mrs .\nOVerfelt- ' J. W. POYNTEE.\nMr. Poynter wrote again in answer to a second letter from\nDr. Hodgson :\u2014\nMonroe, Hart Co., Ky., January 25th, 1892.\nR. HODGSON, ESQ.,\u2014DEAR SIR, \u2014I received a letter from you in regard\nto more information in the cases of Mrs. Overfelt and Short. I have made\nall enquiry that can be made, I think, have not found any one to refer\nyou to.\nYou will find, enclosed, Mrs. A. B. Meadows' statement written and\nsigned in her own hand. Hoping that will suit you,\nJ. W. POYNTER.\nThe statement enclosed was as follows :\u2014\nMonroe, Hart Co., Ky.\n[Received January 29th, 1892].\nMR. HODGSON,\u2014You said that you had rather have my signature about\nwhat my mother and grandmother said when they were sick. She was very\nlow with the typhoid fever ; her sister was living in Mo. She told us one\nnight her little boy was dead, she said she [had] seen him in heaven. We got\na letter from my aunt in a short time, stating that he died that very night.\nMy grandmother was taken with the same fever. She did not know\nanything. She told us one day that she saw aunt and uncle coming through\nShakertown in a covered wagon. We did not know that they [were] coming,\nbut they got here in a short time and said that they came through Shaker-\ntown at that very time. AuCE R MEADOWS.\nL. 1081. Dream.\nThe following case was sent to Mr. Myers, on December 20th,\n1895, by Miss C. M. Bruce.\nMy first experience concerning dreams coming true occurred in 1887,\nduring the Jubilee week. In July, my sister and I occupied the same bed\nroom, and on the Thursday I awoke her with the statement that an old\nfriend of my father's had just died. The dream which came to me was\nextremely vivid. I saw my father receive a telegram, which I read over his\nshoulder, stating that Admiral Erskine died, aged 81, at the Albany,\nLondon. Next morning I told my father, and he said that Admiral Erskine\nwas then in Scotland, and he did not think the age correct, but two days\nafterwards we saw the announcement in the Times of the death, according\nto my dream, Thursday, age 81, at the Albany. I may add I had not seen\nAdmiral Erskine for years, and we had not been talking of him before my\ndream.\n(Signed) CORINNA M. BRUCE.\nM. RICHARDS.\nGRACE K. BRUCB.\nWILLIAM C.

Richards is our old maid, to whom I told my dream the morning\nafter I dreamt it. I do not know the hour Admiral Erskine died. . . .\nNo, Admiral Erskine did not care for children, he was only a great friend of\nmy father's. . . .\nThe Times Obituary of Saturday, June 25th, 1887, gives: \"On\n23rd June, at LI, Albany, Piccadilly, Admiral John Elphinstone\nErskine, late M.P. for Stirlingshire.\" The age at time of death is\nnot given.\nIt will be observed that the month is given wrongly in Miss\nBrace's account ; but the Thursday in Jubilee week, on which she says\nthat her dream occurred, was June 23rd, \"Jubilee week\" beginning\non Monday, June 20th.\nL. 1082. Ad Pn Apparition.\nThe next case was obtained through Miss M. H. Mason. Mrs.\nSidgwick had an interview with the percipient on April 13th, 1896,\nand writes :\u2014\nMrs. Jamieson is at present servant to Miss M. H. Mason, of 21, Queen's\nMansions, Victoria-street, and she and her husband, a retired soldier, live\nthere. Mrs. Jamieson seems to be a very intelligent person, and told her\nstory well with very little questioning and with every appearance of wishing\nto make it as accurate as she could. At the time it occurred she was about\neighteen, and was expecting a baby. She was in rather a nervous state, I\ngathered, and she was anxious about her mother who was dying of cancer.\nBut she remembers that on the particular evening before the vision she had\nnot been fretting ; in fact, she had been having a very cheerful evening with\nother young people.\nI did not myself see Mr. Jamieson, who was out. Miss Mason asked him\nfor the corroboration, which he has sent.\nI took the following story down as Mrs. Jamieson related it, reading it\nover to her sentence by sentence, and she signed it at the end.\nELEANOR MILDRED SIDGWICK.\nApril 13ft, 1896.\nIn July, 1877, as shown by the memorial card, Mrs. Jamieson knew that\nher mother was ill and dying. She, Mrs. J., was at Aldershot with her\nhusband, and was to go and see her mother in about a week. One night she\nawoke feeling thirsty. She had not dreamt of her mother. Not caring to\ndisturb her husband, she thought she would get water for herself. When\nabout to get out of bed, she saw in the white dimity curtains at the foot of\nthe bed the features of her mother, the whole figure standing upright, with\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JUNB, 1896.\nher face bound up as if dead\u2014like her mother, but not as though alive. Mrs.\nJamieson is not certain whether there was a light in the room or not. Mrs.\nJamieson lay back in her bed and did not look for a minute or so, then\nlooking up, saw it again and leant forward and shook the curtains. The\nfigure disappeared ; but at the same time she saw the \" shadow \" of her\nfather just in the same form and appearance on the other curtain. She\nlooked again and that was gone. She did not wake her husband at once, but\ndid about a quarter of an hour after, as she felt faint, and later in the night\ntold him what she had seen. About eight o'clock the next morning, a\ntelegram came, saying her mother had died at three o'clock. She is quite\nsure that her vision occurred on the same night, or rather morning, as the\ntelegram was received.\nMrs. Jamieson's mother, Mrs. Griffith, died on July 13th, 1877, at\nChester. Her father did not die for many years after.\nWhen Mrs. Jamieson saw the vision, she felt sure her mother was dead.\nThe face being bound up made her feel more convinced.\n(Signed) JANE ANNE JAMIESON.\nMr. Jamieson writes :\u2014\n21, Queen's Mansions, Victoria-street, S.W., April ISth, 1896.\nMADAM,\u2014I recollect on July 13th, 1877, at North Camp, Aldershot, my\nwife waking me up about 3 a.m. and telling me she saw a vision of her\nmother on the bed curtains, and four or five hours afterwards she received a\ntelegram that her mother had died that morning. ,p JAMIESON\nIn this case the form taken by the apparition is to be noted. Its\nbeing seen in the curtain suggests that it was to some extent an\nillusion rather than a hallucination, or at least that the curtain may\nhave acted as a kind of point de repere for it. Some cases of a similar\nkind in this respect are given in Chapter V. of the \" Report on the\nCensus of Hallucinations,\" Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. X. Two of these\nclosely resemble the one here printed, namely, one on p. 105, where\nan apparition was seen against a mantelpiece which seemed to supply a\nfavourable background for it ; and another on p. 106, where an indis\ntinct figure, gradually becoming quite clear and then fading away\nagain, was seen in the folds of a curtain. There is no clear evidence,\nhowever, that these cases were veridical, though the psychological\nprocess of perception seems to have been of exactly the same nature\nin them as in Mrs. Jamieson's experience.\nP. 152.

I had paid her all the money I carried with me during a little\nbusiness transaction, except some change. When I told this she gave me\nback one dollar (thinking I might need it for something).

Why the\nold man came into the dream was because he attracted my attention.\nI have had other dreams that came true, but they were a long time ago,\nand I cannot give dates exactly.\nJanuary, 1893, I was in Brunswick, Ga., about 9.30 Sunday morning ;\nI was buttoning my boots, and my sister, who had been ill a long time in\nMaine, touched me on the shoulder. I said to my companion, \"Mary is\ndead\u2014she just came to me.\" We were travelling, and I received no word\nfrom my sisters for three weeks. At last in Philadelphia I got the letter,\ntelling me of the death just the time I felt the touch\u2014allowing for the dif\nference in the Eastern and Southern time.\nI can account for that, however. Maine laws are only for drunkards ; a\nvery sick person can get nothing of an alcoholic nature. I told her in the fall\nwhen I was there I would send her all the porter she needed. Just before\nI went South I expressed a box to her. She used to say to the other sister,\n\" How good I was to send her the beer.\" When she was dying, the sister\nwho was with her put a spoonful of the liquor between her lips, and that\nturned her last thoughts to me.

It is, of course, impossible, from the nature of the\ncase, to obtain now any satisfactory evidence that supernormal powers\nwere really exercised. But the widespread primitive belief in\nphenomena of this kind shows that automatic manifestations tend to\ntake similar forms all over the world.\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nThursday Island, Torres' Straits, Queensland, Australia.\nAugust 1st, 1894.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014During a long course of years I have had exceptional\nopportunities of hearing, from coloured people of all parts, stories connected\nwith spiritistical beliefs : and this is one of them.\n* * * *\nGanna's story.\u2014\" My name is Ganna, I am a South Sea Islander. lam\na Christian, everybody know me, I won't tell a proper lie. I have been a\nlong time away from my country ; in the Fiji Islands, in Brisbane ; and\nlately pearl-fishing in Thursday Island, Torres' Straits.\n\"Well, you know when I was in Fijis, I was working with a lot of South\nSea people at the Island of Goira at cotton work, in Fiji, and there was one\nsick man bad with dysentery ; he was an \" Omba \" man, from the South Sea\nIslands too. Well, we used to look out for him whenever we could. Well,\none day one of his countrymen went to see if he wanted anything and found\nhim very bad (insensible), and he was talking, but it was not his voice that\nwas speaking : it was in his belly he was talking. And at last our people\n\fJUNE, 1896.] Supplementary Library Catalogue. 275\ngot talking about it, because he began to talk to everybody in their own\nlanguage. Now I know very well that fellow did not understand my\nlanguage, yet he told me all about my country and what people were dead\nthere. And he told true, because I find it out after, from them other boy\nthat come from my place after. So we must believe it, you know.\n\" Well, after that night time that fellow always talk while he was sick.\nAnd four or five men went inside the house, but they only see the dead man\nlike (he was in a trance, I suppose), and when they strike matches they could\n\u00bbee nobody. Only they can't atop a long time inside : we all try it ; but\neverybody was afraid to stop long, Something make them run away. They\nnever see anything, only they can't stop inside ;\u2014and the boys outside that\nsit down round the hut (made native fashion of interlaced bamboo or cane),\nthey see the hand belong to those people that talk\u2014those dead people\u2014\nand they catch hold of them, and the hands were very small and cold, and\nthe fingers were very short like (like the length of only one joint).\n\" But these people spoke true, and told us in our own language everything.\nThat man he get all right again after that, he live all right, he not die. But\nhe don't know anything about that time he was sick. I never been see any\nthing like that before, but I hear in Mackay, in Queensland, in the sugar\nplantation, that they been see the same thing like that. Tom Torry was with\nme that time too, and he know all about that kind of thing I tell you\nabout.\"\nThis is Ganna's story of the Island of Canna Oanna. Whether this is our\nname or not, I do not know. I fancy the true name is Laccon of the chart.\nHis evidence is very reliable indeed. 1\n* * * #\nWM.

CROOKES, in the chair.\nDR. J. MILNE BRAMWELL read a paper entitled \" What is\nHypnotism ? \"\nDr. Bramwell commenced by giving a short account of the Mes\nmerists and the controversy between them and James Braid. Accord\ning to the former, mesmerism was a physical power possessed not only\nby man, but also by magnets and other inanimate objects ; according\nto the latter, the phenomena were purely subjective, and resulted from\nchanges in the nervous system, not of the operator, but of the\nsubject. At first Braid's explanation of the phenomena was a purely\nphysical one, and since his day various attempts have been made to\n\fJULY, 1896.] General Meeting. 279\nexplain hypnosis from the same standpoint. Dr. Bramwell gave an\naccount of three of these.\n1. The Salpetriere theory, which explained hypnotic phenomena\nby the assumption of a morbid nervous condition. This position has\nbeen rendered untenable since very extended statistics have shown\nthat 95 per cent of mankind at large can be hypnotised, and that the\nmost difficult to influence are the hysterical and ill-balanced. Many\nof the errors of the mesmerists, in reference to magnets, have been\nrevived by this school, and apparently from the same cause, viz.,\nfailure to recognise the influence of mental impressions during\nphysical experiments.\n2. Heideuhain's theory, which explains the phenomena by a\ncerebral inhibition, and entirely depends upon the assumption that\nhypnotic acts are performed unconsciously. The experimental demon\nstration of the conscious nature of hypnotic acts robs this theory of\nall value.\n3. The theory of Mr. Ernest Hart, which explains the phenomena\nby means of cerebral ansemia. There are two fatal objections to this\nview. (1.) It has been experimentally proved that cerebral ansemia is\nabsent during hypnosis. (2.) Changes in the blood supply of the brain\nare not the cause, but the result, of changes in the activity of the\nnervous matter.\nBraid's later theories explained the phenomena entirely from a\npsychical standpoint. He considered the condition essentially one\nof mono-ideism. This view was adopted by Professor John Hughes\nBennett in 1851 and explained physiologically by the assumption of a\nfunctional disturbance in the \" fibres of association,\" with resulting\nsuspension of the connexion between the ganglion cells of the cerebral\ncortex. Psychologically he explained it by \" dominant ideas.\" A\nsuggested idea acquired undue prominence because, owing to the\ndisconnexion between the cerebral ganglion cells, it was unattended\nby its usual swarm of subsidiary ideas and lacked their controlling\ninfluence. The genesis of ideas was not interfered with, only their\nvoluntary synthesis. At a much later date, this psychological explana\ntion was adopted by Professor Bernheim. His views differ, however,\nfrom those of Braid and Bennett on one important point. The latter\npresupposed a definite change in the nervous system as essential for the\nproduction of hypnotic phenomena ; the former thinks that the only\ndifference between the hypnotised and the normal subject consists in\nthe increased suggestibility of the former and finds in \" suggestion \"\nan explanation of all hypnotic phenomena. Hypnotic phenomena,\nhowever, differ frequently in kind, as well as in degree, from those of\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1896.\nthe normal state, and the subjects who are most suggestible in\nhypnosis are generally those who had constantly resisted suggestion in\nthe normal condition.\nDr. Bramwell referred at length to Professor Bernheim's view that\ncrime could be successfully suggested to the hypnotised subject. He\npointed out that this belief rested entirely upon laboratory experiment\nand the assumption that the subject was passing through a mental\ncondition similar to that of the operator. A simple and important\ntest had been omitted, namely, that of questioning the subject in\nhypnosis as to his own mental state. When this was done, it was\ninvariably found that the subject fully recognised the imaginary and\nexperimental nature of the suggested crime. Dr. Bramwell held that\nneither the intelligence nor the volition were necessarily interfered\nwith in hypnosis, and that the subjects, instead of being ready to\ncommit crimes, in reality developed increased moral sensitiveness.\nDr. Bramwell pointed out that there existed a powerful argument\nagainst the explanation of hypnosis by means of mono-ideism or\ndominant ideas, namely, that a wide range of different phenomena\ncould be simultaneously manifested by the hypnotised subject.\nThe most recent explanation of hypnotism, and apparently the\nmost satisfactory, was to be found in the supposed tapping of some\nsub-conscious state and the evoking of a secondary personality.\nAccording to this view, the hypnotised subject, instead of being a\nstunted and maimed individual, in reality possessed far-reaching\npowers over his own organism which were not paralleled in the\nwaking state. The researches of Azam and others have demonstrated\nthe existence of alternating personalities without the intervention of\nhypnosis, while recent hypnotic observations not only show the\nexistence of the alternating personalities, but demonstrate also that\nthey co-exist and communicate with each other. Before this theory\ncan be accepted as a complete explanation of hypnotic phenomena, one\nis entitled to demand an answer to two questions. (1.) What is the\nconnexion between hypnotic methods and the production of the\nsub-conscious state ? (2.) How did the secondary personality acquire\nits rich physical and mental endowments ? To the first question,\n\u2022according to Dr. Bramwell, nothing approaching a satisfactory reply\nhas yet been given. An attempt has been made to explain the latter\nby the assumption that the secondary personality was able to\nvoluntarily control functions, which in some lower ancestral form\nhad been performed consciously, but were now, as the result of\ndevelopment, performed automatically. Dr. Bramwell pointed out that\nthere were many objections to this explanation, chiefly in regard to the\n\f\u2022JULY, 1896.] General Meeting. 281\nintellectual phenomena of hypnosis. The increased intelligence and\nhigher refinement of the hypnotised subject could hardly be explained\nby the assumption that one had evoked the lost powers of some lower\nanimal type.\nDR. LLOYD TDCKEY said that he could confirm from his own\nexperience much of what Dr. Bramwell had said, in particular with\nregard to healthy persons of strong intellect being hypnotisable and\nhypnotism doing no harm. For instance, he had many times\nhypnotised a man who afterwards became a high Wrangler. He also\nthought that hypnotised persons were able to decide what suggestions\nthey would take and what they would not take.\nDR. WYLD considered that the differentiation between hypnotism\nand mesmerism had not been sufficiently brought out by Dr. Bramwell.\nThe mesmerist believed in an aura emanating from himself, which\nproduced the effects ; on the hypnotic theory, this was denied. He\nconsidered that the existence of the aura in his own case was proved\nby tingling in the ends of his fingers, and by exhaustion indicating\nloss of vitality. The aura was visible to some hypnotised persons and\nthat this could not be imaginary was shown by their always seeing it\nalike. It could also occasionally be photographed. He asked how\nDr. Bramwell would account for the success of the mesmerist in\ncuring without verbal suggestion where the hypnotist with all his\nsuggestion had failed.\nDR. BRAMWELL replied that the abandonment of belief in mesmeric\nphenomena and in the aura was simply due to the more careful\nobservations of hypnotists. The seeing of an aura by hypnotised\npersons had been tested by Braid and found to be imaginary, and the\nphotographs never appeared when precautions to avoid deception were\nadopted.\nPROFESSOR BARRETT asked how, on Dr. Bramwel1's theory, with\nwhich he largely agreed, certain facts tending to show the reality of\nan effluence could be accounted for. He had himself been entirely\nsceptical on the point till the experiments he conducted with Mr.\nGurney on the an;esthetisation of separate fingers had convinced him\nthat there was such a thing.'*\n*The later experiments of Mrs. Sidgwick and Miss Johnson with the same\nhypnotist (Mr. G. A Smith), however, point to thought-transference as an explana\ntion and certainly seem to exclude physical influence. They obtained the effects\nwhen the operator did not hold his hand over the subject's hand at all, but merely\nstood with folded arms looking at the finger to be affected, being himself out of sight\nof the subject and at a distance from him varying from about 2J feet to about 12 feet,\n(dee Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 577-593).\u2014ED.\n\f282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 18%\nMr. J. Enmore Jones stated that he had felt an aura issuing\nfrom his hands, and described an instance which appeared to him to\nprove that the seeing of an aura emanating from certain objects was\nnot imaginary.\nCASES.\nL. 1083. Dreams.\nFrom Miss E. K. Bates.\nThe following case of what the percipient describes as \"a\n' haunting ' by the living,\" affords an interesting parallel to the more\nfamiliar type of cases in which \" haunting \" is supposed to be asso\nciated with the dead. It may be remembered that in the \" Report on\nthe Census of Hallucinations,\" under the heading \" Local Apparitions\nof Living Persons,\" (Proceedings, Vol. X., pp. 356 \u20143G3) cases were\ngiven of apparitions of living persons seen independently by more\nthan one percipient in the same place ; but in none of these cases was\nthere any evidence that the \" haunting \" was due to the agency of\nthe person represented by the apparition.\nIn the case here printed, on the other hand, there is a definite\nassociation of the person with the place, which suggests a determining\ncause for the manifestations.\nThe account was enclosed in a letter from Miss Bates to Mr.\nMyers, dated May 25th, 1896.\nI came to 35, Trumpington-street, [Cambridge], on the afternoon of\nMonday, May 18th, having been told of the lodgings by Mrs. Wherry. My\nfriend, Miss Wale, left me that evening and returned to Shelford for the\nnight, which I therefore spent alone in my rooms.\nWhen she returned next morning, I told her that I hud spent a most\nwretched night, being tormented by dreams of a man whom I had not seen\nor heard of for many years past,* but who had at one time and for some 10\nyears been closely connected with my life. I had a most vivid dream of his\nbeing near me, reproaching me for not having married him and gibing at me\nfor having made such a failure of my life in consequence. T woke and fell\nasleep again several times ; but the same man was always back again in my\ndream and saying always the same things. At last during a leaking interval,\nI felt so strongly that his subconscious self was actually in some way present\nwith me that I spoke to him in some such words as the following. I said,\n\" Do go away and leave me in peace. I have only kindly feelings for you,\nand if you find pleasure in coming here to torment me in this way, it only\n\u00ab Miss Bates informs us that she knows the gentleman (whose name she has\ngiven us in confidence) to be still living, as she knows his family well.\n\fJuly, 1896.] Cases. 283\nproves what a miserable woman I should have been as your wife. I command\nyou to leave me alone in the name of the Holy Trinity.\" At length I seemed\nto get the better of the very disagreeable influence and fell once more into\nan uneasy sleep, and was much relieved when Miss Hardwick (the daughter\nof the house) came in with my tea.\nWhen Miss Wale came in from Shelford, I told her of my wretched night,\nand how unhappy it had made me. The impression was so strong upon me\nthat I wrote all the details to a great friend of mine, and mentioned the\nname of the man who had tormented me to this friend. On two succeeding\noccasions during the week I had dreams of the man, but less violent in\ncharacter. Still they worried me very much and I said to Miss Wale, \"That\nman is simply haunting me here. I wonder why. Is Peterhouso near this\nstreet ?\u2014 Because nearly 30 years ago, the man was a gentleman commoner\nthere \" (having entered late after being in the navy). Miss Wale told mc\nPeterhouse was fairly near, but not by any means the nearest college.* The\nlast time I dreamt of the man I said, \" I cannot think why he should worry\nme so here. I wonder if he could possibly have ever lodged in this house.\"\nTo trace a man who happened to be at Peterhouse 28 years ago seemed\nvague enough, but from curiosity I asked Miss Hardwick how long they had\nbeen in the house.\n\"Seventeen years,\" was the answer. \"Who was here before you?\"\n\" Some people who have left Cambridge and I think are not living,\" she\nsaid. \" Who was here before them ?\" was the next question. I added that\nI was trying to trace a gentleman who had been many years before a member\nof Peterhouse.\nMiss Hardwick said that Mr. Peck, the chemist close by, had been in the\nhouse before the people from whom her father took it, but she thought it\nwould be better to ask the porter of the College about the matter.\n\" Probably he was not here so long ago, and any way is not likely to remember\nexactly where each man lodged 28 years ago,\" I thought, but said no more\nand felt it was rather hopeless to get any light on the subject.\nThis morning (May 25th) I went to Mr. Peck, the chemist, for some\nborax, and on leaving the shop determined to ask what seemed an absurdly\nvague question. \" Had he occupied 35, Trumpington-street, about 30 years\nago?\" \"Yes,\" he said, he had gone there in the 50's. \"Had he by any\nchance any gentleman lodging there attached to Peterhouse, named ? \"\nI had absolutely no reason to ask such a question except the strong\nimpression made by my dreams. \"Yes, the gentleman had lodged in the\nhouse for 18 months.\" Mr. Peck remembered him very vividly and proved\nit by producing his photograph, taken with a very large dog whom I had\noften seen and whose name, \"Leo,\" Mr. Peck also mentioned.

I barely knew him then, and had certainly\nnever heard of his rooms or anything about them.\nIn a further letter on the subject to Mr. Myers, dated May 29th,\nMiss Bates says :\u2014\n. . . . It was so much more definite and realistic than an ordinary\ndream, and in the waking intervals I had always the sense of somebody\npresent, whom I addressed aloud, although I did not see him. .\nCuriously enough, the disagreeable haunting has ceased since I discovered\nthat he lived here, but I am still conscious of his presence in a friendly\nway. . . .\nThe following statement, written by Miss Bates for corroboration,\nwas read over by her to the two witnesses who sign it.\n35, Trumpington-street, Cambridge, May 29th, 1896.\n[After an account of her experiences, substantially the same as that\ngiven above, but briefer, Miss Bates continues :\u2014]\nHaving occasion to procure some drug from Mr. Peck, I took the\nopportunity of enquiring if he had rented 35, Trumpington-street some 30\nyears ago, and if by any chance a gentleman of my friend's name had ever\nlodged with him.\nMr. Peck knew the gentleman well, for he had lived with Mr. Peck, at\n35, Trumpington-street, for 18 months before going into college rooms. Mr.\nPeck showed me a picture of my friend and his dog, the facsimile of which\nis in my possession. Without mentioning which rooms in the house I occupy,\nI then asked Mr. Peck if he could remember which rooms the gentleman in\nquestion rented during his stay. Without the slightest hesitation Mr. Peck\ntold me they were the \" large back bedroom over the kitchen or living room\nand the large front sitting-room.\"\nThese are my own two rooms at present.

I was so thankful to hear that the disturbance had\nnothing to do with the lodgings that I took very little notice of the dream,\nespecially as, to the best of my belief, I had never heard the name of the\nman. A day or two afterwards Miss Bates spoke of having dreamt of him\nagain, and remarked, \"He seems to be haunting these rooms.\" When she\nspoke of his having possibly lodged here, I suggested asking the porter of\nPeterhouse.\nI went into Peck's, the chemist, with Miss Bates, but did not know she\nwas going to ask Mr. Peck any questions. The conversation took place as\nMiss Bates relates, and I saw the photograph. I specially remarked that,\nMiss Bates avoided mentioning which rooms she occupied at No. 35, until\nMr. Peck had stated that Mr. had the back bedroom over the living\nroom, and the large front sitting-room\u2014the rooms that Miss Bates\nhas now.\nI may add that I had never heard of these rooms until a lady recom\nmended them to me when I came with Miss Bates to engage them.\nMILDRED WALE.\nL. 1084. A<ipe Vision.\nThe following case, received through the American branch of the\nSociety, came to Dr. Hodgson as an answer to a circular asking for\ninformation about experiences of the kind investigated by the\nSociety.\nThe percipient, Mrs. Baker, writes :\u2014\nGENTLEMEN,\u2014This circular having been sent to me with a request that\nI should answer, I will say that in March, 1846, I had a remarkable\nexperience, which was afterwards published in Harper's [New] Monthly\nMagazine, June, 1880. The name of the paper is \"A Puzzle for Meta\nphysicians ;\" it can be relied upon for perfect accuracy.\nHAUHIETTE WOODS BAKER.\nWe give extracts, describing the case in full, from the article\nreferred to. It will be observed that though it was not written for\nmany years after the event, the testimony of the various witnesses,\u2014\nthree of whom knew of the vision before news of the corresponding\nevents had been received\u2014was written ten years earlier.\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1896.\nIt may also be remarked that little stress can be laid on the\napparently premonitory nature of part of the vision, since all the\nscenes represented after the first were what the percipient might\nnaturally\u2014from her knowledge of the chief persons concerned\u2014\nhave expected to follow the first scene, which was the coincidental\none. Even the alleged close resemblance between the letter that first\nbrought the news and the letter read by Mrs. Baker in her vision, is a\npoint that cannot be pressed at this distance of time, no written note\nhaving been taken of the visionary letter.\nIn the month of November, 1845, the ship Sophia Walker sailed from\nBoston, bound for Palermo. The owners, Messrs. Theophilus and Nathaniel\nWalker, had invited their brother-in-law, theRov. Charles Walker, to go out\nto Palermo, as passenger, for the benefit of his health.\nAmong the crew was a young man named Frederick Stetson. He was the\neldest son of the Rev. Caleb Stetson, at that time pastor of the Unitarian\nchurch in Medford, Massachusetts. Frederick had been in a store in\nBoston, but not being well, returned home to be under the care of a.\nphysician. His health did not improve ; and Dr. Bemis, of Medford,\nadvised a sea-voyage as most likely to restore his vigour. Frederick was;\ndelighted with this prospect, and his parents reluctantly consented. It\nwas thought best for his health that he should go on board as a sailor ;\nbut a contract was made with Captain John Codman, that in case Frederick\nshould become weary of his duties, he should be admitted to the cabin in the\ncapacity of captain's clerk.\nFrom the fact that the Rev. Mr. Stetson was a neighbour and friend, I\nbecame acquainted with these circumstances at the time the young man left\nhome and embarked on board the Sophia Walker. The father also requested\nmy husband to speak to Captain Codman, his former pupil, in regard to the\nyouth. In common with other friends, I sympathised deeply with Mr. and\nMrs. Stetson in parting from their son under these painful circumstances ;\nbut domestic cares and other scenes gradually effaced these impressions,\nuntil I forgot the length of time he expected to be absent, and indeed lost\nall recollection of his voyage.\nI relate these circumstances in detail that the reader may understand\nmore fully the remarkable facts which followed.\nDuring the latter part of February, 1846, the death of my mother, Mrs.\nLeonard Woods, of Andover, was succeeded by my own dangerous illness. In\nMarch I was seized with hemorrhage of the lungs, and lay for days hovering\nbetween life and death. One night, when the crisis seemed to have passed,\na, member of my husband's church, Mrs. Sarah Butters, who had been watch\ning with me, retired soon after midnight to give place to my husband, who\nwas to watch with me till morning. I had taken the medicine prescribed by\nmy physician, and was endeavouring to compose myself to sleep, when all at\nonce, with the vividness of a flash of lightning, the following scene wau\nbefore me : A tremendous ocean storm ; a frail vessel pitching headlong\n\f.TCLY, 1896.] Cases. 287\ninto the trough of the sea ; a billow mountain-high ready to engulf her ; a\nslender youth clinging to the mast-head ; a more furious blast, a higher\nwave, and the youth, whom notwithstanding the darkness I instantly\nrecognised as Frederick Stetson, fell into the foaming, seething deep. As\nhe struck the water I shrieked in agony ; and my husband sprang to my\nside, expecting to see the crimson drops again oozing from my lips. My\ncountenance, full of horror, terrified him.\n\" What is it ? \" he asked.\nI motioned him to silence, unable to withdraw my thoughts from the\nscene. I still heard the roaring of the angry billows, the shouts of the\ncaptain and crew.\n\"Man overboard!\" \"Throw a rope!\" \"Let down the life-boat!\"\n\"It's no use ; the ship has pitched beyond his reach ! \"\nFresh groans from my lips brought new anxiety to my faithful watcher.\nHe seized my trembling hand, placed his fingers on my pulse, and started\nback with dismay when he felt their feverish bound.\n\" What is it ? Are you in more pain ? Shall I go for the doctor ? \"\n\"Oh, it's dreadful !\" I gasped. \"I can't tell. It's awful.\"\nThen I passed into a still more remarkable state. Heretofore I had seen\nwhat was going on at the moment ; now my mind went forward, and saw\nevents that occurred two, three days, two weeks, later. The storm had\nabated. The vessel, though injured, was able to proceed on her way. It\nwas the Sabbath ; the crew were sitting in silent reverence, while the\nclergyman, Rev. Mr. Walker, read, prayed, and preached a funeral sermon,\ncaused by the late sad event. Every eye was moistened, every breath\nhushed, as the speaker recounted the circumstances connected with\nFrederick's voyage, and endeavoured to impress upon the minds of his\nhearers the solemn truth of the uncertainty of life. Another scene. Our\nown chamber ; a messenger coming in haste with a letter from Captain\nCodman announcing Frederick's death. The words of the letter I could\nread. One more scene. I seemed to be again on board the Sophia Walker.\nMr. Stetson was there, standing by Frederick's open chest, into which the\ncaptain had thoughtfully placed every article belonging to his late clerk. The\nfather's tears fell copiously while Captain Codman dilated on Frederick's\nexemplary conduct during the entire voyage. When they reached Palermo,\nhe had expressed his wish to enter upon the duties of a clerk, according to\ntheir contract, if tired of a sailor's life, and since that hour had taken his\nplace with the officers in the cabin.\nAll this passed before my mind with the rapidity of lightning. I lay\ntrembling with agitation, until startled to present realities by my husband's\nvoice, while he held a spoon to my lips.\nThe first question I asked was, \" What day of the month is it ? \"\n\"The 10th of March.\"\n\" What time did you come into the room ? \"\n\" It was past twelve when I gave you your medicine. Soon after, you\nseemed greatly distressed. Can you tell me now what it was ? \"\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JULY, 1896.\n\" It is dreadful,\" I whispered, gasping between every word. \" Frederick\nStetson is drowned : I saw him fall into the sea.\"\n\"Oh no;\" was the cheerful reply. \"You had been thinking of him\nand dreamed it.\"\n\" No ; I was wide-awake. I saw him fall. I have not once thought of\nhim for weeks. Oh, what will his parents say ? \"\nSoon after this, exhausted by my terrible excitement, I fell into a.\ntroubled sleep. When I awoke, it was dawn, and I immediately commenced\nnarrating to my husband the scenes I had witnessed, he making a note of\nthem, and their precise date. Perceiving that this conversation greatly\nagitated me, he left the chamber to inquire whether the Sophia Walker had\ncome into port, and promised to direct our son, a schoolmate of Edward\nStetson, to ask whether Frederick had returned from his voyage. This he\ndid, thinking to allay my nervous excitement, which he fully believed to be\nthe result of a fevered dream.\nAt an early hour Dr. Daniel Swan, one of my physicians, came to my\nbedside. He expressed his disappointment at finding my pulse greatly\naccelerated, and asked the cause. I then, though not without great\nexhaustion, repeated to him what I had seen, my husband being present,\nMrs. Butters (the lady already referred to), and a woman who had lived in\nmy family for years. In the course of a week several persons were made\nacquainted with these facts, though from the fear lest they should reach the\nears of the parents, they were told under an injunction of secrecy.\nIn the meantime I listened eagerly to my son's daily bulletins from his\nschoolmate. \" Fred is coming soon.\" \" Mother has his clothes all ready.\"\n\"Father says he may be here any day now.\" \"The Sophia Walker is due\nthis week.\"\nIt was two weeks before the ship arrived in port ; but I was so far\nconvalescent that I was permitted to sit up, wrapped in blankets, for an\nhour or two each day. On one of these occasions, while Mr. Baker and\nfamily were at dinner, the bell rang, and presently I heard my husband, in\nanswer to the summons of the servant, hurry to the door. It was scarcely\na minute before he entered my chamber, pale, and evidently trying to\nconceal his emotion. He had an open letter in his hand, upon which his\neyes were fastened.\n\"You have Captain Codman's letter,\" I said.\n\" Yes,\" he answered, \"and in almost the words you repeated to me.\"\nI held out my hand for the sheet, and my tears fell fast as I read the\nfollowing lines, evidently written in great haste :\u2014\n\" March 25th, 1846.\n\"REV. MR. BAKER, \u2014MY DEAR Sin, \u2014I must beg you to perform a painful\nduty. Poor Frederick was lost overboard in a gale on the 10th. You must\ntell his father. I cannot.

Mr. Baker did not return home for hours, having offered to go to\nCambridge, and convey the sad intelligence to Merriam Stetson, the second\nson, who was a member of Harvard College.\n\" I am to go into Boston to see Captain Codman in the morning,\" he\nsaid. \" Mr. Stetson is anxious to see him, and I shall ask him to return\nwith me.\"\nI recalled the last scene on board the Sophia Walker and said : \"I thought\nhe himself went in. It is the first thing not exactly in accordance with my\nvision.\" I called it vision, for I was not asleep, and therefore it could not\nbe a dream.\nThe next morning, when Mr. Baker called at Mr. Stetson's house to take\nany additional messages, he learned that, impatient and restless, the\nsorrowing father had found it impossible to wait, and had taken the earliest\nconveyance into Boston, where a scene occurred like what I had witnessed.\nI find it impossible at this distance of time to recollect all the persons to\nwhom these operations of my mind were made known before the letter of\nCaptain Codman gave reality to my vision. Among them were Dr. Swan\nand two female friends, who havc since passed beyond the scenes of earth.\nDuring his life my kind physician frequently urged me to publish an account\nof these remarkable facts. My reasons for not doing so are suggested in a\nletter to Rev.

A much-respected Professor of Greek and Latin, his main\nreputation was won by his writings on questions of philosophy and\npsychology ; he gave his acute and penetrating intellect to the study\nof hypnotism, at the time when students of hypnotism were still\ncomparatively few ; and he was equally at home in speculating about\nthe Universe and in carving cherry-stones. Yet to those who\nknew him the intellectual element in him was overshadowed by the\nemotional ;\u2014such was the headlong transparency, the vehement\nlovableness of his abounding soul.

In numbers it surpassed the most sanguine\nexpectations, exceeding considerably its predecessors in Paris and\nLondon. As many as 450 members inscribed themselves,\u2014besides\nthe recipients of complimentary tickets\u2014and the number of papers\nsent in was so large, that even the careful distribution of the\nwhole subject among five sections of the Congress, carrying on\ntheir discussions simultaneously, did not quite allow sufficient time to\nexhaust the programme. This success is partly to be attributed to the\nwise comprehensiveness with which the Committee had sought to bring\ntogether all schools and sections of psychology, along with members of\npractical professions\u2014law and medicine\u2014interested in the psycho\nlogical aspect of their professional work : but a large share of the\ncredit remains due to the personal efforts of the officers of the\nCongress, and other members of the Reception Committee. The\nremoval of Professor Stumpf, in 1894, from Munich to Berlin\u2014which\nat first seemed to threaten the Congress with the loss of its President\n\u2014turned out in fact a gain ; as it secured us the services not only of\nProfessor Stumpf\u2014-who opened the proceedings with an admirable\naddress and presided throughout with dignity and impressiveness\u2014but\nalso of his worthy successor in the Munich chair, Professor Lipps, who\naccepted the position of second President. But, as every one is\naware who has taken part in organising a Congress, the lion's share\nof the labour always falls to the secretariat ; and the ability, energy,\nand bonhomie of Dr. Baron von Schrenck-Notzing\u2014whose name is not\nunknown to readers of this Journal\u2014received ample and well-deserved\nrecognition.\nThe fact that the Congress was held in Germany, along with the\nimportant place that German work occupies in modern psychology,\nas in other departments of modern science, rendered it natural that\nthe Teutonic language should largely predominate in the papers and\ndiscussions. But the international character of the Congress was still\nwell maintained. For various special reasons the number attending\nfrom England was smaller than we could have wished, but with the\naid of Americans we managed to muster a fair contingent of English-\nspeaking students of psychology; other contingents joined from France\nand Italy, Russia, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland ;\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OcT., 1896.\nand every effort was made by their German hosts to make the\nforeigners feel at home. The reputation of Bavaria\u2014and of Munich\nin particular\u2014for interest in intellectual culture, and for generous and\ncordial hospitality, was worthily sustained ; and if I do not dwell on\nthe supper given by the municipality in the historic hall of the old\nRath-haus, or other entertainments in which I was privileged to take\npart, it is because I am afraid of suggesting to readers who were not\nthere that the psychologists really went to Munich to eat, drink,\nand be merry, and contemplate works of art. The only discordant\nelement was the weather, which interfered with more than one\nprojected entertainment ; but even the almost unceasing rain had one\nadvantage for us, as it kept the well-thronged rooms agreeably cool.\nThe meetings of the Congress were held in the spacious and\nconvenient buildings placed at its disposal by the University of\nMunich. They were divided into \"general\" meetings\u2014for which papers\nor addresses of general interest were selected\u2014and \"sectional\" meetings.\nPapers of a more special kind were distributed among five sections,\nsitting as a rule simultaneously. Section I. dealt with the physiology\nof the brain and the senses, and with psychophysics ; Section II. dealt\nwith the psychology, in the strictest sense, of the normal individual ;\nSection III. discussed pathological and criminal psychology ; and\nSection V. comparative and psedagogical psychology. The subjects\nwith which the S.P.R. is concerned were assigned to Section IV.,\nwhich dealt with \" the psychology of sleep, of dreams, and of hypnotic\nand allied phenomena.\" The meetings for papers and discussions took\nplace morning and afternoon ; and as I have already intimated, every\nthing was done that could be done to promote social intercourse among\nmembers of the Congress during the intervals, and so aid in bringing\nabout that fuller mutual understanding among students of distant\ncountries and diverse schools, which is the most important gain to be\nexpected from international congresses generally.\nI now turn to speak more particularly of that part of the work of\nthe Congress which falls within the range of our own investigations.\nAmong the subjects allotted to Section IV., hypnotism and suggestion\nhad the lion's share ; as about two-thirds of the papers read dealt\naltogether, or to a great extent, with the causes and effects either of the\nhypnotic state or of non-hypnotic suggestion and self-suggestion. In\nseveral of these papers the subject was treated from a therapeutic rather\nthan a psychological point of view; thus the account given by Dr. Voisin\n(from the Salpetriere) of the treatment of certain forms of mental aliena\ntion by hypnotic suggestion, or by Dr. Wetterstrand, from Stockholm,\nof the use of artificially prolonged sleep in, especially, hysterical cases,\n\fOcT., 1896.] International Congress of Psychology. 297\nor by Dr. Lloyd Tuckey, from London, of the value of hypnotism in\nchronic alcoholism\u2014these and other contributions of similar import\nfrom England, Germany, and Switzerland must be left to the judgment\nof physicians. Still, the new light which hypnotism has thrown on the\nrelation of mind to body has such great importance for psychologists,\nthat it cannot but be of indirect interest for them to obtain as definite\nan idea as possible of the nature and limits of its therapeutic efficacy ;\nand the same may be said of the effects of suggestion in the waking\nstate, and the morbid effects of self-suggestion. And so long as it is\npossible\u2014as we have just seen it to be\u2014that a medical president of\nthe British Association should sum up the experience of fifty years of\nanaesthetics without even mentioning hypnotism, it is important from\nall points of view that every opportunity should be taken of drawing\nthe attention of educated persons generally to the surgical value of\nhypnotic antesthesia ; even though we may regard as too sanguine the\nprediction of Dr. Falk Schupp (from Bad Soden)\u2014who read an\ninteresting paper on \" The Problems of Suggestive Anaesthesia\"\u2014that\nthis mode of producing painlessness will in course of time supersede\nmaterial anaesthetics.\nThe last mentioned paper was in part of directly psychological as\nwell as practical interest. The same may be said of a comparison\nby. Dr. Ewald Hecker (from Wiesbaden), of the different modes of\npsychical healing found to be efficacious in the normal condition,\n(distraction of attention, fanatical confidence, shock of surprise,\nalarm, persuasion), with various forms of hypnotic suggestion, avail\nable in different phases of the hypnotic condition. In other papers\nagain the phenomena of hypnotism were discussed from a primarily\npsychological point of view. Thus Dr. Pierre Janet (of Paris)\nexamined the conditions of the influence exercised by the hypnotiser\non his patients even in the periods intervening between actual states\nof hypnotic sleep ; Dr. Bramwell gave an account of experiments\n\" on the appreciation of time by somnambules,\"\u2014as shown in the\nperformance of post-hypnotic suggestions\u2014and discussed the \"so-called\nautomatism of the hypnotised subject \" ; and Dr. Crocq, of Brussels,\npresented a careful study of the sensibility, memory, and intellectual\nfunctions of hypnotised persons, distinguishing the effects due to\nsuggestion from those attributable to the hypnosis itself. Both the\nlast-mentioned speakers criticised the tendency of the Nancy school to\nreduce hypnotism entirely to suggestion, and exaggerate the force of\nthe latter; and the audience could not but regret that no representative\nof this historic city was present to reply to the criticism. Finally, I\nmust not omit to mention an important paper by Dr. D. Vogt\u2014a\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OcT., 1896.\ncontribution to the Psycho-Physiology of \" Dissociations-Zustande,\"\nwith special reference to hypnotic phenomena\u2014which it will be easier\nto appreciate in a printed form.\nOn the whole it seemed clear that the study of psycho-therapeutics\n\u2014springing out of and mainly based on experiences of hypnotism\u2014is\nthoroughly alive in Western Europe ; that an increasing number of\ncompetent persons are interesting themselves in it, theoretically as well\nas practically ; and that much intelligent and careful observation and\nexperiment is being carried on which cannot but have valuable results.\nWhen, however, I turn from hypnotism to telepathy and the other\nsubjects with which our society is concerned, I have to give a\nless encouraging report. In Germany, at least, the interest in these\nsubjects\u2014which a few years ago was in a promising state of develop\nment\u2014appears to have recently somewhat faded. It was, indeed,\npartly due to accidental causes that the subject occupied so small a\nspace in the programme of the Congress : since Mr. Myers, who had\nintended to read a paper \" On Certain Phenomena of Trance,\" was\nunable to attend the Congress, and Dr. Lie'beault, of Nancy, was also\nabsent, and unable to read his paper on Communication of Thought by\nMental Suggestion. The papers actually read, bearing on the subject\nof telepathy, were \" On a Statistical Enquiry into Hallucinations,\" by\nMrs. H. Sidgwick; on the question \"whether it is possible by means of\nan international statistic of hallucinations to obtain a proof for the\nexistence of telepathic influence,\" by Dr. T. Bager-Sjogren, of Sweden ;\nand on experiments in involuntary whispering and their bearing on\nalleged cases of thought-transference, by myself. This last was a reply\nto a pamphlet by Dr. Lehmann, of Copenhagen ; and will appear, in\nan enlarged form, in the next number of our Proceedings. It might\nperhaps have led to an interesting discussion had Dr. Lehmann been\npresent, but though he had been expected at the Congress he was\nunfortunately unable to come ; and in his absence I thought it best to\ncut the paper very short. Dr. Eager Sjogren's paper was, as may be\nseen from the title, almost entirely of a critical nature, and the points\nhe raised were very similar to those already familiar to readers of\nHerr Parish's work on hallucinations. Mrs. Sidgwick's paper was\npractically a reply to parts of Dr. Bager-Sjogren's, though written\nindependently ; but she was fortunately able to include a report by\nProfessor William James, on the results of the American Census of\nHallucinations, which he sent over for the purpose. The results of\nthe American census had not previously been fully worked out; and\nit is satisfactory to find that they corroborate ours, and confirm the\nconclusion that the number of alleged death coincidences cannot be\n\fOcT., 1896.] A Diary of Telepathic Impressions. 299\naccounted for by chance. Professor James has promised a fuller report\nfor a future number of the Proceedings. There was some discussion\non Mrs. Sidgwick's and Dr. Bager-Sjogren's papers in which Professor\nRichet and Herr Parish took part. The only other paper dealing\nwith any of our subjects was one by M. Flournoy, of Geneva ; which\npresented evidence of the constructive force and richness, the creative\noriginality of the \"subliminal imagination\" exhibited in the utterances\nof many mediums. These characteristics, the writer argued, require us\n\u2014from a strictly psychological point of view\u2014to place their phenomena\nin a class apart from those of ordinary hysteria. The paper did not\ncontain much that was substantially new for those who had read Mr.\nMyers' articles in our Proceedings; but M. Flournoy's conclusions\nwere evidently the result of independent study of facts.\nIt is much to be hoped that at the next Congress there will be\nmore new facts and observations in Psychical Research to bring\nforward.\nIt was decided by the Committee of Organisation at the close of\nthe Meeting, that the next Congress should take place at Paris in\n1900, when it is hoped that Professor Ribot will be First President.\nProfessor Richet accepted the post of Second President\u2014held by\nProfessor Lipps on this occasion\u2014-and M. Pierre Janet that of General\nSecretary. H- gIDGWICK.\nA DIARY OF TELEPATHIC IMPRESSIONS.\nThe following diary, recording a series of impressions many of\nwhich are apparently telepathic, was sent to us by Dr. Thomas Duke,\nof 33, Bilton-road, Rugby. 1 he writer is a patient of his own, and\nhe has tried some experiments in thought-transference with her, of\nwhich we hope to receive an account later. He assures us that every\nword she has written is to be depended on.\nIt will be seen that most of the incidents are of an extremely\ntrivial character ; but this does not, of course, lessen their value\nevidentially. It would, however, be easy to explain almost any one of\nthe coincidences, taken alone, as the result of lucky guessing, founded\non the writer's general knowledge of the circumstances in each case \u2022\nor association of ideas, leading her to think the same thing at the same\ntime as one or other of her companions ; or mere chance. The weight\nof the record lies in the accumulation of a large number of coin\ncidences,\u2014more, we think, than can reasonably be attributed to\nchance. For this reason chiefly, and also because different persons\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OcT., 1896.\nwould probably estimate differently the value of each case, we have\nthought it best to reproduce the whole diary, with the exception of a\nfew entries which do not refer to Mrs. S.'s telepathic impressions. It\nmust be observed that many impressions were recorded before it was\nknown whether they were correct or not, so that the diary is not a\nmere selection of lucky hits.\nIn answer to enquiries, Mrs. S. writes to us (March 3rd, 1896) :\n\" At the time they were written, I had not the slightest idea they\nwould be of interest to any one excepting myself. I simply wrote\ndown in a rough way anything that occurred which struck me as being\nunusual. ... I am sorry I have none of the notes sent by Mrs.\nPh. I did not keep them after entering them in my book at the time.\nI enclose three which I have kept from Mr. Duke ; these are all I can\nfind.\" These three notes will be found printed below. In answer to\na further question as to the exact times at which the various entries\nwere made, Mrs. S. writes :\u2014\nJuly 4th, 1896.\nAll my entries in the diary were made at the exact time mentioned, my\nobject being to see how far I was right ; and as the notes were made for my\nown pleasure, I should not be likely to enter them without first noticing the\ntime. This I always did before putting it down ; but when a day only is given,\nI have made the entry before retiring at night. If, however, I did leave\nanything until the next day, I should say \"yesterday, so and so.\"\nDiary of Mrs. S.\nDec. 22nd, 1893.*\u2014Monday night I had a strange dream (about my sister\nL. who is in Rio, where the revolution is now going on and the country in a\nfearful state of tumult when last I heard, Nov. 14th). I dreamt my sister\nwas in church standing before the altar sobbing, and she was dressed all in\ncrape mourning, and I thought in my dream she had lost some one near and\ndear to her. The church was as large as our parish church.\n[Note added afterwards.] See note at the beginning of 1895. t\nJan. 3rd, 1894. \u2014I was in the front sitting-room and dare not go out of\nthe room for the cold ; my plants were awfully dry, and hearing E.

PODMORE'S \"POLTERGEISTS.\"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL or THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nSIR,\u2014I am sorry that when preparing his paper on Poltergeists, which\nappeared in the last number of the Proceedings of the Society, Mr. Podmore\ndid not find it possible to state the eleven cases he investigated in full. An\nabbreviated account, though quite satisfactory to the person who makes it\nfrom the complete report before him, is of little use to any one else as\nmaterial out of which to form an opinion on a subject such as that now\nunder discussion. I regret also that it was not found possible to include\nin this class of stories, others of much the same nature, which have been\nexamined and reported upon by members of the Society.\nAs I understand him, Mr. Podmore, after investigating his eleven cases\nin detail, concludes that the alleged phenomena have been in every case the\nresult of trickery ; that the \"agent \" in eight cases was probably a young girl,\nand in the remaining three a boy ; moreover, that in nearly every case the\nyoung people were either physically or mentally abnormal. If the latter part\nof this conclusion is correct, all theories which might attempt to account for\nthe disturbances by supposing the use of more or less elaborate machinery\nmust, I think, be abandoned.\nIn order to arrive at his general conclusion, the author is obliged :\u2014\n(a) very largely to discount the evidence produced, and to assume that it\n\fOcT., 1896.] Correspondence. 307\nis seriously inaccurate by reason of (1) errors of observation, (2) errors of\nmemory or relation ; (6) to assume that the errors all tend to make the\nphenomena more easily explicable by trickery than otherwise ; and (c) to\nexplain as a sensory illusion a point which he feels is too well vouched for,\nboth in these and other cases, to be put aside as part of ordinary defective\nevidence and too important to be neglected.\n(a) It must be admitted, of course, that errors both of observation and\nnarration do frequently intrude themselves into the evidence of the most con\nscientious witnesses, and will do so as long as man is fallible. These errors\nare, however, of less moment in the present inquiry than Mr. Podmore\nassumes. It will be found that errors mostly occur about the relative order\nin which definitely observed facts follow one another, and not so much about\nthe facts themselves; about the presence, absence, or position of some one not\nevidently and immediately connected with the incident which at the moment\nwas claiming attention. When the order in which events follow one another\nis of the essence of things, as in the case of Mr. Davey's alleged slate-writing\ntricks, inaccuracy of this sort is very material ; but when the facts being\ninvestigated are not interdependent, as is mostly the case in the present\ninstance, the exact order in which they took place is of little moment. It\nis also not of much consequence where people evidently not immediately\nconnected with a phenomenon are placed by a witness, provided he is clear\nabout those who could in any way control it.\n(b) Errors of observation and memory need not, I hold, always tend to\nmake the explanation of unusual phenomena more easy by known causes.\nForgetfulness and mal-observation may sometimes tend the other way.\nFor example, the witness may more easily forget that the person most likely\nto cause, say, the movement of a chair, by trickery, left the room just before\nthe movement was observed, than that he approached the chair about the\ntime it moved. Mal-observation may make a chair simply fall when in fact\nit rolled over and over.\n(c) Mr. Podmore is disposed to explain the appearance to many\nwitnesses, both in these stories and in others, of the slow or flying movements\nof objects through the air, by assuming that the deponents were subjects of\na sensory illusion. I know of no reason for this. Surely, if excitement had\nsuch a tendency, it would have been observed and reported so frequently\nas to become common knowledge. If the five or six witnesses in the\nWorksop case, who observed a basin \"rise slowly from the bin \" till \"it\ntouched the ceiling, and then fell suddenly to the floor,\" at the usual rate\nof such movement,* had expected the thing to be drawn up by a string, when\nin fact it was jerked up,\u2014I can imagine that under excitement a sensory\nillusion might, had it arisen, have induced them to report as they have done ;\nbut these people at the time believed that the things were being thrown\nabout, and expected quick movements. Had a sensory illusion seized\nthem collectively, it would, I fancy, under these circumstances, have taken\nthe form of seeing things move quickly, when, in fact, they were being\nwafted slowly along.\n* Why did the illusion cease when the basin had half completed its flight ?\n'\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OcT., 18%.\nMr. Podmore's theory of trickery requires in several of the cases that\nthe principal agent should have from one to three confederates, and this\ncircumstance makes the difficulty of assigning a motive\u2014a difficulty\nacknowledged by the author to be great\u2014still greater. It may be that a\nyoung girl (or boy) would do much for the sake of notoriety, but she would\nhardly find two or three persons ready to hand willing to take much trouble\nfor the same satisfaction.\nIt must be remembered also that the value of evidence depends not only on\nthe intelligence and truthfulness of a witness, but also on the opportunities\nthe witness has for becoming acquainted with the matter deposed to. Mr.\nWestlake in the Ham case, otherwise an excellent witness, had less oppor\ntunity of observing the girl moving the things herself when he was looking\nfurtively under his arm, than Police-Constable King, who was calmly\nstanding in the open, had of observing chairs and things moving of them\nselves.\nWhen every allowance has been made for misstatements, from whatever\ncause arising, a considerable number of facts are still in evidence which could\nnot have been caused by trickery, and I believe that if all the cases were before\nus in full, this would be found to be more and more the case.\nI do not propose to put forward any complete theory of my own as an\nexplanation of Poltergeist phenomena, nor indeed could I. I am inclined,\nhowever, to think them due to the interference of some occult agency of the\nsame nature as that alleged to obtain in spiritualistic manifestations. If this \u2022\nis the case, the fact that the disturbances occur more readily in the vicinity\nof some central figure, \u2014in these cases a girl or a boy.\u2014no longer appears a\nsuspicious circumstance, but becomes explanatory, \u2014a ' ' medium \" in fact\nbeing pointed out.\nThe evidence given by witnesses of trickery, and the confessions of\ntrickery, which assisted Mr. Podmore to support his conclusion, become\nnow my difficulties. Confessions are, however, not always conclusive. How\nmany old women have falsely confessed, in times gone by, to dealings with\nthe Devil ? We do not know how much pressure in the present cases was\nused to obtain them. The sudden interrogation of a policeman or a\nstranger, in a certain tone of voice, might be very terrifying to a rustic\nchild. In one of the cases the confession was subsequently withdrawn.\nThe fact that trickery was by some witnesses seen in operation is a more\ndifficult matter to deal with. I can only say that it seems to be a constant\ncompanion of all sorts of occult phenomena. If in Poltergeist cases the\ntelekinetic energy is directed by some intelligence, as it seems to be, it is\nconceivable that this energy may be used to move the \"sensitive\" to\nfraudulent actions when its telekinetic potency fails. There is^some\nevidence in other cases that this does take place, idiotic though it seems\nTo prevent seeming contradiction, I may add, with respect to 'the\nArundel case, that I, like Mr. Podmore, have changed my opinion\nthese matters since 1884, but in an opposite direction.\nG.

[Nov., 1896.\nA vote of thanks to the donors for some presents to the Library\nwas passed.\nA further report of the House and Finance Committee was\nreceived, and after considerable discussion, the recommendations which\nit contained were adopted.\nVarious other matters having been disposed of, it was agreed that\nthe next meeting of the Council should be on Friday, December 4th,\nat 3 p.m., at the Westminster Town Hall, previous to the General\nMeeting arranged for that day.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 82nd General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, October 30th, at 8.30 p.m. ; Professor\nSidgwick in the chair.\nProfessor W. F. Barrett read a further paper on the Dowsing\nor Divining Rod, dwelling mainly on the historical aspect of the\nquestion : but also treating of its use in the present day for finding\nwater and lodes of mineral ore. The extensive commercial use of\n\" dowsing \" gave strong testimony to its efficacy. He described the\ndifferent methods used by different dowsers,\u2014hazel rods, steel wires, etc.,\nheld in various ways,\u2014and the different sensations they experienced,\nand also the different behaviour of the hazel rods, etc., at different\nperiods and with different dowsers. From these differences and the\nfact that they can often be shown to depend on the theory held by the\noperator, he deduced that the effect on the rod was due to sub\nconscious muscular action ; the dowser in some way at present\nunknown receiving unconsciously the impression of the position of\nthe water or metal sought for.\nTwo professional dowsers, Mr. Tompkins, of Chippenham, and\nMr. Chesterman, of Bath, were present and were kind enough to\ngive, in answer to questions from the audience, interesting accounts of\ntheir methods and sensations. Mr. Tompkins' rod moves for springs\nof water and for metal lodes (he has recently found two gold reefs in\nSouth Africa) ; but does not move for water in drains or pipes. Mr.\nChesterman, on the other hand, who uses a hazel rod or a bent steel\nwire indifferently, finds that it moves one way for spring water and\nanother for water in pipes or drains.\nIt is hoped that opportunities may be arranged for experiments\nwith Mr. Tompkins and other dowsers.\nProfessor Barrett's paper is expected to appear in a future number\nof the Proceedings.\n\fNov., 1896.] A Diary of Telepathic Impressions. 311\nA DIARY OF TELEPATHIC IMPRESSIONS.\nDiary of Mrs. S.\n(Continued from the Journal for October, p. 306.)\nJune 22nd [1894]. \u2014I am certain Mr. Duke will come in this morning\nbefore 12 o'clock.

He at once said, \"Oh,\nthere is nothing in will-power.\" I said, \"Oh, isn't there?\" and at once\nturned back and did it without his telling me what, and I was right.\nJuly 18th. \u2014Mrs. Ph. told me she saw Mr. Duke had received a message\nwhile he was in her room, and she said she knew it was from me. I did\nsend one at that time, and he received and answered it, but how did she\nknow it was from me ? For he did not say a word to her about it.\nJuly 21st. \u2014I told E.

I\ndreamt I was at some sea-side place, but where I do not know, for I have\nnot seen the place before, and while we (my husband [and I] ) were on the\nbeach a vessel came along and the people were all watching it, when one of\nthe fishermen came rushing along and shouting : \" She is off her feet.\" We\nlooked and saw the people on the deck all rush to one side of the boat. This\ncaused it to tip, presently it turned over like a cockle-shell, and I saw it in\nthe water, bottom uppermost.

I was just telling my husband, when\na letter came, saying she had been in bed ill for more than a week. (I have\nsince heard Miss W. had to have injections of morphia to help her bear\nthe pain.

Did you telepath to me last evening 1 I felt the\ninfluence very strongly, and have often at times since, but could not quite\nmake out whether you were ill or not.\nPlease write your answer, as I keep them for reference.\u2014Yours faithfully,\nTHOMAS DUKE.\n(3)\nBilton-road, Rugby, October 12th, 1894, 7.55 p.m.\nDEAR MRS. S., \u2014Many thanks for your note, which was very interest-\nng and most important.\nI thought to-night, about half-hour or perhaps more since, that you were\ntelepathing to me to let you have the medicine by 8, I answered telepathi-\ncally. It will be a little late, I am sorry to say, as patients bothered me\nso, that I could not let the boy go. Please let me know if this is correct,\nand keep all my notes for reference. Yours in haste, THOMAS DDKE\nP.S.\u2014I thought you were talking to your husband and your sister about\nit, and I can feel how excited you all are over this experiment as to whether\nit will arrive by eight, and are watching the clock, your sister being only\nhalf convinced.\n[Mrs. S. adds with reference to the last note :\u2014\" What Mr. Duke\nsaid about my husband and sister was quite correct ; it was just as he\ndescribed.\"]\nOct. 13th, 9.30 a.m.\u2014I telepathed to Mr. Sn. to come avid ask my husband\nand sister to go for a drive with him. They were thinking of going to\nLeicester and I did not want them to go. He came at 10.15 a.m. and they\narranged to go with him. I told my sister before she could tell me who had\nbeen and what for. I was in bed at the time and did not see him.\nOct. 15th, 7.30. \u2014I left off telepathing for my medicine. When it came\nat 8.10 p.m., I said when I heard the knock at the door, \"That is my\nmedicine.\"\nOct. 18th.\u2014I sent for my medicine, but it did not come.\nOct. 19th.\u2014In the night I dreamt my father, Mrs. B., Mrs. J., Mrs. Br.,\nand I were in a room quietly talking . . . and while we were all sitting\nthere talking, a vision came through the ceiling into the midst of us. We\ncould scarcely see it at first, but gradually it became more distinct, and it was\na young woman with a very plain face at first and a dreadfully heavy chin ;\nbut as we looked at her she became very beautiful, her expression was lovely,\nher hair and figure were like my sister L.'s before she went abroad. She\ntried to talk to us, but could only do so slowly at first. She said she had\nbeen every night, but this was the first time she had been able to make\n\fNov., 1896.] A Diary of Telepathic Impressions. 315\nherself seen. And I remember thinking it was because Mrs. J. was there.\nShe came to me and put her hand on my shoulder and I put my hand on her\nwaist while she was speaking to me and I felt her dress was soft satin.\n(black)\nOct. 21st.\u2014I dreamt my sister told me the maid did very well, and I\nsaid, \"Only very well?\" This morning I have a letter saying the maid\ndid \"very well.\"\nOct. 22nd.\u2014Just as my husband shut the door, I telepathed to him with\nall my force, \"You are forgetting that very important letter.\" He stood\nfor a few seconds, then came back and fetched it.\nOct. 23rd.\u2014Mrs. Ph. told me she often sees me when I am ill, and can\nhear me speaking most distinctly. (How is this ?)\nOct. 23rd.\u2014Mr. Duke called this evening, and said last night I appeared\nto him three or four times, and he got quite vexed at me, because I kept\nwaking him, but he did not seem to be able to get rid of me. The last time\nhe saw me I was in bed, as if ill, my arm was above my head, and I had on\na turquoise bhie jacket. This is very remarkable, because I always wear\npink jackets, and had only the day before finished making myself a blue\none, and tried it on before retiring, to be sure it was all right. I need\nscarcely say Mr. Duke knew nothing whatever of this.*\n[We sent a copy of this entry to Dr. Duke for endorsement, and he writes\nwith regard to it:\u2014\"July 3rd, 1896.\u2014She did not actually appear to me,\nbut something which I thought connected with her woke me several times.\nQuite true in other respects.\u2014Thomas Duke.\" He adds :\u2014\"The statement\nthat Mrs. S. ' appeared ' to me is rather misleading. I was woke up several\ntimes (and indeed on many nights), although a very sound sleeper, by what\nfelt like a strong telepathic impact from Mrs. S. She never actually\n' appeared ' to me. On the one occasion referred to at the end, I closed my\neyes and tried to make out whether she really wanted me, when I seemed to\nsee her mentally as she describes, in the blue jacket ; but on questioning her\nI found that she, at the time I was awakened, was not wearing this jacket,\nthough she had worn it all day.\"]\nOct. 28th, 2 o'clock p.m.-\u2014I distinctly felt Mrs. J. telepath to me that\nshe would come in. She came at 2.30. 1 told her she made up her mind\nto come at 2 o'clock, and she said, yes, she did.\nOct. 28th.\u2014I asked several times during the last week how Mrs. B. was,\n(it was reported she was suffering from cancer) but could not get to hear\nanything of her. Last night I dreamt I called to enquire, and was shown\ninto the drawing-room. In a few minutes Mrs. B. herself came in looking\nvery ill indeed, and when I asked her how she was, she said, \"Oh, getting\nbetter fast, and I shall soon be about again.\" I went to church, and made\na rush to catch her husband on coming out this morning, just to see if my\n* Mrs. S. adds in a letter written March 30th, 1896 :\u2014\"The incident about my\ndoctor seeing my blue jacket the night I finished making it was very remarkable\nindeed, for I assure you he knew nothing whatever about it, and never saw it at all\nuntil that night when he said I appeared to him.

While here, he told he had been\nwaiting for a message about my medicine, and he feels I will not telepath\njust now. I told Mr. Duke I felt he was bringing something for me to see,\nand he said, \" Oh, did you 1 \" and at once took it out of his pocket.\nNov. 1st.\u2014My medicine has not come, so at 9.30 I telepathed for it,\nand it came. I had my reasons for not wishing to before.\nNov. 2nd.\u2014I felt all [the] afternoon Mrs. J. would not come in to see me,\nbecause she thought a certain lady (Mrs. C.) was here, and she did not want\nto meet her.\nNov. 3rd.\u2014Mrs. J. just been in and said she did not come yesterday\nfor the reason named. I was lying on the couch this afternoon thinking of\nnothing, when all at once, Mrs. B. W. came into my mind and I wondered\nhow long it was since I saw her and what made me think of her just then,\nand strange to say, after tea Mrs. B. W. was announced. I told her I had\nbeen thinking about her that afternoon, and she said,\" We have been talking\nabout you,\" and saying they had not seen me for two years and she would\ncome that very night.\nNov. 4th. \u2014When Mrs. Br. came this evening I told her I felt she was\ncoming last night. She said she fully made up her mind to do so and she\nwas coming in, but her boy's cough became so bad she was obliged to stay\nand doctor him.\nNov. 6th.\u2014E. and I both felt Mr. Duke would come in this morning, and\nhe did. She told me she had been listening to every carriage passing before\nhe came.\nNov. 8th. \u2014 I told my husband before breakfast Mr. Sn. would call and\nwish to drive me to Mrs. Ph. this afternoon. I was not very well, but hurried\nup to be dressed when he came. He was here by a quarter to 11 o'clock, and\nwe went after dinner.\nNov. 10.\u2014This afternoon, I could not help thinking about my old friend\nMrs. P., wondering where she was, and why she did not write to me.\nNov. 11th.\u2014After church this morning a friend, Miss F., stayed to speak\nto me. She said she had had a letter this morning from Mrs. P. asking her\nto see me, and tell me she was awfully busy removing ; that was why she had\nnot written, but would do so soon.\nNov. 12th.\u2014My husband told me to telepath for medicine. I did, but\nfelt certain it would not come, and it didn't.\nNov. 13th.\u2014I again telepathed for medicine at 10 o'clock a.m. It came\nat 7 o'clock p.m.\nNov. 14th, Wednesday.\u2014When the doctor came to-day, he said he had\nbeen very much bothered, and did not get my message until Tuesday.\n\fNov., i\u00ab\u00bb6.] A Diary of Telepathic Impressions. 317\nNov. 15th, Thursday.\u2014This evening my husband very much wished to\nsee a certain Mr. S.

I could not see, but said, \" You have given him until a quarter to 9\nto come ; \" but he didn't come.\nNov. 16th, Friday.\u2014I am thinking a great deal about a lady friend away,\nand ought to send some foreign stamps I promised, but my head is aching\nso badly I cannot write. \u2022 \u2022\nNov. 17th, Saturday.\u2014This morning by first post I have a letter from this\nfriend, in which she says she is thinking about me all day, and feels she really\nmust write and thinks it strange I have not written to her.\nNov. 19th, Monday, 11 a.m.\u2014I feel really vexed about my medicine, for\nmy doctor knows I require it. I have kept the last dose for a day, for fear\nthe pain comes.\n8 o'clock p.m.\u2014I have just asked E. for this last dose, telling her I feel\nsure some more is coming.\n8.30.\u2014I felt my doctor said to me : \"Then why don't you telepath if you\nwant more?\" I said : \"No, I will not, if it doesn't come.\"\n8.45. \u2014Medicine just come. I told E. Mr. D. would come to-morrow\nmorning. I called upon Mrs. S. and told her I expected her in to see me\nevery day last week. She said not a day passed but she thought she would\nlike to come in, but was afraid I might have visitors and so put it off.\nNov. 21st, Wednesday.\u2014I passed Mrs. B.'s, who is ill in bed, and\nwondered if she would know my footsteps. As I came back from my errand\nI called to see her. This was at 11.30 a.m., and she told me she had just\nbeen in a beautiful sleep and dreamt I came to see her. She had only just\nsaid to her husband, \" C. is coming this morning to see me.\"\nNov. 25th, Sunday.\u2014While in church this morning I thought of Mrs. P.\nand decided to go and see her, if fine, in the afternoon. When I got home,\nI found a note from her (written while I was in church) asking me to go and\nsee her.\nNov. 26th, Monday.\u2014When Mr. D. called to-day, I asked ivhy he did\nnot come last Tuesday. He said he thought of doing so, but had a small\npox case turn up unexpectedly and felt it best not to do so.\nNov. 26th, Monday, 12 a.m. \u2014I telepathed to E. in the kitchen (for I\ncould not go to her) to bake me two apples to have with my dinner, but at\ndinner time she brought in my dinner but no apples. I felt disappointed,\nbut said nothing. Just as I was finishing, however, she brought in my\napples. I said, \"When did you think of these?\" She said, \"All in a\nmoment after 12 o'clock.\" This I consider remarkable, because she was very\nmuch occupied at the time.\nNov. 28th, Wednesday. \u2014I telepathed to my husband to be home in ten\nminutes. This was 25 minutes to 9 o'clock. He came just a minute before\nthe time. I wanted him very particularly.\nNov. 29th.

He said he was detained in the\nstreet five minutes by a gentleman.\nDec. 10th.\u2014Directly I had finished my breakfast a strong feeling came\nover me that Mr. D. would call, and again at half past 10 o'clock, and I\nlistened for his carriage.

Alexander has sent to Mr. Myers various criticisms\non the case collected by Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo and published, with\ncomments by Miss Johnson, in Part XXX. of the Proceedings, (p. 116)\nunder the above title. It will be remembered that in the case in\nquestion, an apparition, calling itself Wischnevsky, appeared to Ivan\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1896.\nZdanovitch and subsequently to him and his brother together, and\nstated that a fur-cloak bought at second-hand by the former had\nbelonged to one Nevsky, who had died of phthisis. This turned out to\nbe correct, but the statement of the apparition about \" Wischnevsky \"\ncould not be verified. Professor Alexander writes :\u2014\nCaixa 906, Rio, July 21st, 1896.\n. . . Allow me to point out that in the Russian case printed in the\nlast Proceedings the speeches attributed to the ghost differ to a suspicious\ndegree from the generally hazy and fragmentary communications of other\nsimilar apparitions. It does not appear that Mr. Solovovo ever had a\npersonal interview with the percipients themselves.* My own experience\nleads me to the conclusion that in these investigations correspondence,\nhowever extensive and prolonged, fails to elicit exact information, unless,\nindeed, you have in hand that rara avis, a very good witness. A slight\napparent discrepancy may be noticed between Mr. Kronhelm's presentation\nof the case and the statement of Ivan Zdanovitch. In the comments no\naccount is taken of the difficulty of getting proper names through subliminal\nstrata, t These (the names), I believe, often tend to resolve themselves into\nother similar names stored in the supraliminal memory. The transformation\nthus effected would throw investigators entirely off the track. In some\nautomatic, or, as I should prefer calling it, intuitional, script of my own, to\nbe described in detail on a future occasion, I had to write the word navio\n{ship). First of all the name of a German grammarian came into my mind,\nMadng, but with the medial consonants transposed as if it were Mavdig, and\nalthough I had an inkling that something was wrong, I did not at that\nmoment recollect the right form of the name. I wrote therefore Mav, and\nstopped. The pencil had traced the first stroke of the M so faintly that the\nsyllable read as Nav, and this I forthwith completed as Navio. In a\nless passive frame of mind, this part of the message would have been falsified\ninto Mavdig, the material being utilised which lay nearest at hand in my\nsupraliminal memory.\nTo pass to another point, I believe that the view generally accepted by\nS.P.R. authorities is that apparitions, whether falsidical or veridical, are in\nthemselves messages clothed in a sensory form. If so, they ought not to be\nconfounded with \"controls,\" for the subliminal self is hypothetically a real\nentity, even when masquerading. Yet the ghost in the Russian case is\nthrown by Miss Johnson into the same category as \" Phinuit.\" . . .\nI do not know why sensory hallucinations should, on the strength of the\nhighly dramatic character of dreams and crystal-visions, be supposed so\ncapable of being mere histrionic conceptions of the subliminal self. A large\npart of the evidence for hallucinations published by the S.P.R. seems to\npoint to an opposite conclusion, for in the veridical cases in which the\n* The place where the apparition was seen is about 750 miles from St.\nPetersburg, where Mr. Solovovo lives.\u2014ED.\nt See, however, Mrs. VerralPs note on this point, loc. cit., p. 124, foot-note. \u2014ED.\n\fNov., 1896.] Correspondence. 321\nhallucinatory impressions can be traced to a probable source, it is found that\nthey are very generally the more or less exact reflections of a real occurrence,\nand if more incomplete than our normal percepts, they are almost as literal\nin presentation. It would appear, indeed, that when a sensory impression\nis sufficiently vivid to be projected outwards, it is very likely to correspond\nto some external reality. Symbolism and histrionism would rather seem to\nbelong to the play of an imagination spontaneously exercised or only slightly\nstimulated by telepathic agency.\nOn page 123 of the Proceedings, Mrs. McOall Black's and Dr. D. J.\nParsons' cases are referred to in support of the surmise that the guilty\nconscience of the Jew dealer was the cause of the telepathic impact received\nby Mr. Zdanovitch. It may be, indeed, that the brooding over crimes and\nmisdeeds, whether already realised or existing only in intention, does some\ntimes produce the conditions necessary for unconsciously impressing a\ndistant percipient. But in the case under consideration, this explanation\ndoes not seem to be an adequate one. To judge from the account, the Jew's\nideas about right and wrong did not rise above the level of morality of the\nclass to which he belonged. He is supposed to have lied about the fur cloak.\nWell, \u2014a little fibbing was quite in the way of business and was not likely to\ndisturb his mind. I can hardly imagine a Russian Jew brooding in trouble\nover an untruth which had helped him to effect a sale ; and unless the dread\nof contagion from phthisis is common among the lower classes in Russia, it\nis not at all probable that he was aware of the danger lurking in an infected\narticle of clothing, such as the fur cloak is supposed to have been. Admitting,\nhowever, that he did feel some slight misgivings on the subject, were they\nsufficient to cause such vivid and recurrent hallucinations in the mind of a\nperson who must have been almost a stranger to him ? I do not think so.\nThe agency in such impressions and hallucinations as those under discussion\ncan only be a matter of very cautious conjecture.\nA music master, Snr. Mathias Teixeira, has recently related to me, among\nother facts of his personal experience, the following :\nSome 15 or 16 years ago, he stood talking one night at a very late hour to\na friend of his,\u2014this at the door of a cigar-shop in the Rua do Theatro, Rio.\nWhile conversing, a very uneasy feeling came over him, as if he were in\ndanger of imminent assassination. He spoke to his friend about it and\nurged him to come away. That very night, and not long after they had left\nthe spot, the floor (or floors) above the cigar-shop gave way and, falling in,\nkilled some, if not all, of the inmates of the house.\n'Now, if ,instead of the menaced fall of a house, the danger had really\nproceeded from a plot to rob or murder him, it would have been easy to\nconclude that the would-be criminals were unconsciously concerned in trans\nmitting a telepathic warning, and, nevertheless, this conclusion would have\nbeen erroneous\u2014always supposing that the subliminal self of Snr. Teixeira\nhad obtained an inkling of their intentions in the same unaided way in which\nit sensed danger in the unsafe proximity of the cigar-shop.\nMere hypotheses must not be allowed to \"set.\" They need beating up\noccasionally. Are all collective hallucinations transferred from a first\n\f322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1896.\npercipient to others 1 This supposition would receive much confirmation if\na perceptible interval in time were observable between the impressions\nreceived by the different persons present. I have an idea, however, that\nsuch collective experiences sometimes come to two or more percipients at\nexactly the same moment, and this would favour your conjecture that\nthe energy that causes them may on occasion be localised outside the\npercipients.\nA. ALEXANDER.\nProfessor Alexander's remarks were submitted to Miss Johnson,\nwho writes in reply :\u2014\nI do not think that Professor Alexander represents my position quite fairly\nin saying that I have \"thrown the ghost into the same category as 'Phinuit.'\"\nWhat I attempted to do was to indicate provisionally all the interpretations\nof the case that I could think of\u2014none of which seemed to me completely\nsatisfactory\u2014and to consider in connection with them any phenomenon that\ncould possibly throw light on them. Thus, I compared the apparition to a\n\" control, \" because \"mediums\" often represent their \" controls \" to them\nselves under the semblance of a visible form. This does not prove that the\nsource of the apparition is the same in both cases ; it merely shows that it\nmay be so. To compare hallucinations, as I also did, to dreams and crystal-\nvisions is simply to follow the ordinary psychological view of them.\nIn the \"Report on the Census of Hallucinations\" (Proceedings, Vol. X.,\np. 301) the view is expressed that \"experience gives some ground for think\ning that telepathic ideas do project themselves as hallucinations more readily\nthan others ; \" this, however, is a very different thing from the converse of\nthe same proposition, as stated by Professor Alexander, namely, that ' ' when\na sensory impression is sufficiently vivid to be projected outwards, it is very\nlikely to correspond to some external reality.\" We know that many\nhallucinations are subjective, because we can often trace their origin. We\ncannot, therefore, assume in any particular case that a hallucination is not\nsubjective, unless we have definite evidence to that effect. And if some\nfeatures in a complicated vision appear to be veridical, while others cannot\nbe verified, we ought not, I think, to assume that these latter also represent\nsome external reality.\nThe telepathic agency of the Jew dealer in the case referred to was,\nagain, only put forward as one of three possible explanations\u2014not, in my\nview, a specially probable one. I believe, however, that phthisis is\ngenerally considered on the Continent to be a very infectious disease, so that\nhis sense of guilt on the subject would presumably have been much stronger\nthan if the case had occurred in England.\nAt the same time, I fully admit the force of Professor Alexander's argu\nments as to the difficulty of proving that the hallucination was caused\ntelepathically. But by telepathy, I think we do not postulate anything\nmore than the derivation of ideas from another mind ; there is no necessity\nfor supposing any mental activity, either conscious or unconscious, on the\n\fNov., 18%.] Correspondence. 323\npart of the \"agent.\" And since the evidence\u2014especially the experimental\nevidence\u2014for telepathy is far stronger than that for clairvoyance (by\nwhich I mean the direct perception of material conditions otherwise than\nthrough the recognised sensory channels), it seems to me safer for the\npresent to interpret as telepathic all cases where the percipient's impression\nrelates to facts unknown to himself, but known to some other person.\nWith regard to Professor Alexander's ingenious suggestion that we might\ntest whether collective hallucinations are transferred from one percipient to\nanother by noting whether the impressions are received by both at precisely\nthe same moment or not, I cannot feel that such a test could be made\nconclusive\u2014even if instruments of the almost inconceivable delicacy required\nfor exactly recording the moment of perception could ever be made. What\nwe know so far of telepathy lends no support to the supposition that it works\nthrough a physical medium. We have not discovered any physical substance\nacting as an obstacle to it ; neither have we any reason for believing that\nit takes longer to affect a percipient thousands of miles off than one near\nat hand. We do not know that any tune at all is required for the\ntransmission. It is, however, reasonable to suppose\u2014on the analogy of all\nphysiological and mental processes known to us\u2014that, whether or not an\nidea in one mind takes time to reach another telepathically, there is a period\nof latency after it first enters that other mind before it emerges into full\nconsciousness ; and that this latent period varies in different persons. Any\nwant of coincidence in time, therefore, between the impressions of two\npercipients in a collective hallucination would not necessarily tend to show\nthat the impression was transferred from one to the other, because the\nlatent period may have been longer in one case than in the other. On the\nother hand, if the impressions could be proved to be absolutely coincident,\nthis would not, I think, tell against the telepathic explanation, because, as\nalready remarked, we have no reason to think that any time is required for\nthe transmission.\nALICE JOHNSON.\n\" POLTEEGEISTS. \"\nTo the Editor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nSIR, \u2014In the interests of impartial criticism it would no doubt have been\ndesirable that the cases discussed in my paper on Poltergeists, in Proceedings,\nPart XXX., should have been printed in full. But I doubt if many readers\nof the Proceedings will have shared Colonel Taylor's regret that such was not\nthe case. As regards the method of selection pursued, I should perhaps\nexplain that I went upon the principle of printing as fully as possible the\ndoubtful cases, and abridging those only where either trickery was clearly\nindicated, or where none of the manifestations as reported were beyond\nhuman powers to have performed. I agree, of course, with Colonel Taylor\nthat no selection of the kind can be wholly satisfactory, where it is possible\nfor different views to be taken of the evidence ; but I may perhaps infer\u2014\nsince he urges nothing to the contrary\u2014that in the case (No. VI. in my\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 189C.\narticle) in which Colonel Taylor was himself the reporter, he accepts my\npresentation of the evidence as at any rate impartial.\nAs regards the general argument of his letter, I must join issue with him,\nmainly on this ground\u2014that he assumes the offensive, when he should be\nwholly on the defensive. The antecedent presumption against the operation\nof any new physical force in such matters is of course very great. It would\nstill be great, even if we had\u2014what we have not\u2014incontrovertible proof\nof the action of such a new force in a neighbouring field. But when this\ngeneral presumption is strengthened by the discovery that, in some of the\ncases under consideration, the phenomena were actually due to ordinary\nhuman agencies, the presumption becomes almost overwhelming.\nNo doubt, as Colonel Taylor points out, the common sense view that these\nmarvels are all due to trickery assumes errors of observation and memory\nwhich cannot always be proved, and assumes further that these errors will\ngenerally tend to make the facts appear more marvellous. As regards the\nfirst point, I cannot agree with Colonel Taylor that the disagreement which I\nproved to exist in several of these cases between various witnesses as to the\npresence, absence, or position of particular persons, is a matter of little conse\nquence ; since the person about whose whereabouts there was this ambiguity\nwas as a rule the person to whom circumstances pointed as the author of the\ntrickery. As regards the second point, our experience in psychical research\nhas been that mistakes of this kind generally tell in favour of the marvel.\nBut as a matter of fact, the argument of my paper is independent of any\ndemonstrition of individual errors, and I may perhaps be allowed to say\nhere that, until in the early part of this year I carefully collated these\neleven cases, I held it as not improbable that there was something inex\nplicable in these Poltergeist manifestations. That I now hold the opposite\nopinion is not due to the strength of the a priori presumption already referred\nto, but solely to the fact that I can find no evidence that will weigh against\nthat presumption. There are obviously two qualities to be looked for in\nevidence : first, it must be good as evidence, i.e., it must be recent, and must,\nproceed from witnesses of intelligence and character ; and, secondly, the\nthings attested must be of such a kind that no mistake about them is possible.\nNow, in examining these Poltergeist cases, I could nowhere find these two\nqualities combined. There is much testimony that is credible, but incon\nclusive ; and again much which would be conclusive if its remoteness and\nthe defect of education on the part of the witnesses did not lessen its credi\nbility. My argument is that the field of inquiry is already so wide that we\nare justified in drawing the inference that this characteristic of the evidence\nis not accidental. It is precisely because the evidence in Case VI., for\ninstance, is credible, that it is inconclusive ; and again, the conclusiveness\nof the evidence in Case I. is due to the circumstances which lessen its\ncredibility. To me it appears that the only method of refuting this\nconclusion is to produce testimony which shall be at once credible and.\nconclusive.\nFRANK PODMORE.\n\fNo. CXXXIV.\u2014VOL. VII.

PAGE\nExperiments in Thought-transference at a Distance\u2014illustrated .. 325\nCases 829\nSupplementary Library Catalogue 339\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE\nAT A DISTANCE.\nOur readers may remember an article in the Journal for June,\n1893, (Vol. VI., p. 98), containing a description of experiments in the\ntransference of diagrams, carried out by the Rev. A. Glardon, of\nTour-de-Peilz, Vaud, Switzerland, as agent, with a friend of his,\nMrs. M., as percipient, she being at the time at least 200 miles\ndistant from him. Both Mrs. M. and Mr. Glardon are Associates of\nthe S.P.R.\nSome time after this account appeared, Mr. Glardon sent us two\nmore sets of experiments of the same kind, with the information that\nhe was still continuing the experiments. As no further report of\nthese has yet reached us, we give here an account of all hitherto\nreceived.\nThe original diagrams drawn by both agent and percipient, care\nfully dated and with the notes they made on them at the time, have\nbeen sent to us, and most of them are reproduced in the Plates.\nThough in no case has the agent's diagram been reproduced by the\npercipient with absolute accuracy, we think that the degree of resem\nblance on the whole is decidedly beyond what could reasonably be\nattributed to chance. It will be seen from the account what propor\ntion of success was attained, though it is not easy to estimate this\nwith exactitude, because the percipient several times made a number\nof little scribbles which might be counted either as parts of one\ndrawing, or all as separate drawings. See, e.g., Plate II., R. 3. Where\nwe have given the number of drawings she made, without reproducing\nall of them, (see e.g., Plate I., R. 1, b) we have, of course, counted as\nmany as possible, in order not to over-estimate the argument against\n\f326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1896.\nchance coincidence. Thus, such a case as R. 3 would have been\ncounted as eight drawings.\nThe experiments will be best understood by a full description of\nthe Plates, which we now proceed to give.\nIn all cases, the letter O on the Plates denotes the drawings of the\nagent and the letter R those of the percipient ; and the dotted lines\nmark off the drawings belonging to each experiment.\nPLATE I.\u2014In the experiments here illustrated, the agent was at\nTour-de-Peilz, and the percipient at Florence, and the former notes\n\" 10 p.m.\" on his sheet of diagrams as the hour of the experiments,\nalso that he used the diagram O. 1 on May 8th and 9th, [1893] and\nO. 2 on May 10th and llth.\nThe percipient made one drawing, reproduced as R. 1, a, on May 8th.\nOn May 9th she made eight attempts, of which the one most nearly\nresembling 0. 1 is given, as R. 1, b. On her paper is noted \" 1893,\nTuesday, May 9th, 10.15.\" On May 10th, she attempted nothing.\nThe whole of what she drew on May llth is reproduced as \" R. 2 \";\nher paper being marked, \" May 11, '93 ; 10 p.m.\"\nPLATE II.\u2014The diagrams O. 3 and O. 4 were used in experiments\nin which the agent was at Tour-de-Peilz and the percipient at Torre\nPellice, Italy; 0. 3 was used on May 19th and O. 4 on May 22nd and\n23rd; in all cases at 10 p.m. R. 3 represents all the drawings made\nby the percipient on May 19th; her paper is marked \" 19 May, 1893;\n10p.m.;\" and also bears the note;\u2014\"a small very bright design or\nobject.\" On May 23rd, at 10.5 p.m., she made three drawings, two of\nwhich are reproduced as R. 4. It will be observed that the bracket in\nthe agent's drawing seems to be reproduced in the second of these, but\nthis may be a mere chance resemblance. O. 5 is the diagram used by\nthe agent on June 2nd at 10 p.m., he being still at Tour-de-Peilz, and\nthe percipient at Vevey. She made no drawing on this date, but\nnotes:\u2014\"June 2nd, 1893 ; 10 p.m. See nothing but a sort of frame\nand a crown; too sleepy to draw it.\"\nThe agent's drawing corresponding to R. 6 is shown as O. 6 on\nPlate III. In this experiment, the agent and percipient were both in\nthe same house at Tour-de-Peilz, but in different rooms. It occurred\non June 7th, 1893, and Mr. Glardon gives the following account of\nit:\u2014\n\" Gryon-sur-Bex, Vaud, June 27th, 1893.\n\"Mrs. M. was sitting alone in a room adjoining the one I was in.\nI drew the diagram and fixed my attention on it. After two or three\nminutes, Mrs. M. called aloud, saying, ' I am too much excited to-day,\ndon't go on ; ' and on my entering the room, she said, ' I can see\n\f1896.] Thought-transference at a Distance. 327\nnothing but the design of the embroidery I have been working at this\nmorning, and 1 will not draw it because I think it too silly.'\n\" She sent me afterwards that design ; you can judge for yourself.\nThe fact is that, unawares, I had drawn a diagram resembling closely\nthat design.\"\nMrs. M. sends us also the following note, with regard to this series\nof experiments :\u2014\n\" Gryon-sur-Bex, June 27th, 1893.\n\" DEAR SIR,\u2014I wish to add a few words to Mr. Glardon's com\nmunication of even date.\n\" I would say that during the latter part of the experiments which\nMr. Glardon and I made after sending off the first results to you, I\nwas on a visit and was frequently disturbed ; in fact, I often found it\nimpossible to keep the appointment as desired.\n\"May I add that I think if my friend had made but one single\ndrawing on a page instead of many, the impression on my mind might\nhave been more distinct. Of this I cannot be sure, but it may be\nworthy of consideration.\"\nThis refers to the fact that the first five diagrams Mr. Glardon\nused (besides two used by him on May 6th and May 12th, on which\ndays Mrs. M. apparently made no attempts to receive an impression)\nwere drawn on one sheet of paper. The percipient's drawings, how\never, do not afford any clear evidence that confusion was produced by\nthis means.\nThe rest of the diagrams on Plates III. and IV. belong to a later\nseries of experiments, carried out between December 14th, 1893, and\nJanuary 9th, 1894. They were sent to us in April, 1894, by Mr.\nGlardon, who writes :\u2014\n\" Tour-de-Peilz, April 24<A, 1894.\n\" . . . I have made a new series with the same correspondent,\nMrs. M., she being in Ajacuio, Corsica, where she is still, and I here.\nThe time was half-past nine p.m., French time ; and the results have\nnot been very satisfactory. During December, 1893, and January,\n1894, we tried many times a week. Unfortunately, Mrs. M. did not\nalways attend, and I myself was sometimes prevented by visits or\ncommittees from attending ; so that, in all, we had only a dozen real\nexperiments, both attending the same night and at the same moment.\nOf these, I send you four instances in which it seems to me that we\nachieved a fair amount of success. One is a striking example of\ndelayed and persistent impression. Two nights running I tried to\nsend a Maltese cross [see 0. 10]. Mrs. M. sat on the same days, and\n\f328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEc., 1896.\nthe two days following,\u2014pencil in hand and eyes shut as usual,\u2014on the\n5th, the 6th, the 8th, and the 9th of January ; and the approximation\nwas every time greater, till the cross came out distinctly.\n\"On December 28th, Mrs. M. seems to have seen the comet I had\ndrawn pretty well [see O. 9]. On the 14th, she had an impression of\nsomething resembling a crown, and I had drawn a rose [see O. 7].\nFinally, on the 21st, she reproduced at once and exactly my drawing,\nas you will see from her own bit of paper [see O. 8 and R. 8]. It is a\npity she did not use for our sittings anything larger than a common\nnote-book. However, I send you leaves torn from it, corresponding\nto my drawings.\"\nIn these four experiments, we have reproduced all the drawings\nmade by the agent, and also all made by the percipient on each\noccasion, except in the experiment of January 5th-9th, 1894, which\nis marked O. 10 and R. 10.\nIn her drawings marked in the Plate R. 7, she notes the date and\nhour as December 14th, 10 p.m. ; and writes : \" Like a pair of tongs\n\u2014a tooth with prongs\u2014a crown,\"\u2014the three descriptions apparently\nreferring to her three drawings. The agent's drawing, O. 7, is dated\nDecember 14th, 1893. Her drawings marked R. 8 are dated December\n21st, 1893, 9.30 p.m., the agent's, O. 8, being dated December 21st,\n1893; and those marked R. 9 are dated December 28th, 1893, 9.30 p.m.,\nthe agent's, 0, 9, being also dated December 28th, 1893.\nWith regard to the experiment of January 5th-9th, 1894, the\noriginal diagram was a Maltese cross (Plate III., 0. 10), which the agent\nnotes that he used on January 5th and 6th, 1894. The percipient made\non January 5th, at 9.30 p.m., four drawings, of which the one most like\na Maltese cross is reproduced as R. 10, a. On January 6th at the\nsame hour, she made four drawings, none of which are at all like the\ncross. On January 8th, at 9.30 p.m., she made four drawings, the\nmost successful of which is reproduced as R. 10, b. On January 9th,\nat 9.30 p.m., she made first two drawings, resembling each other pretty\nclosely, and added the note, \"same impression as last time.\" One of\nthese is reproduced as R. 10, c. She seems then to have gone off on aii\naltogether wrong tack, as nine diagrams of a different character, some\nof them resembling a flag or a key, follow. Next she appears to have\nmade a fresh start, drawing three diagrams, one of which is R. 10, d.\nTo these she appends the note : \" always come back to the same thing.\nProbably he has sent nothing.\" Finally, on one corner of the sheet,\nshe draws a Greek key pattern, marked \" afterwards.\"\nIn this experiment, the large number of attempts made, and the\nfact that success was not attained until two or three days after the\n\fI\n\f\f\f\fDEO., 1890.] Cases. 329\nagent was trying to transfer the drawing, of course strengthen the\nprobability that the success may have been merely due to chance. On\nthe other hand, all the diagrams made on each day, except the last,\nresemble one another more or less closely, as if the percipient had had\nonly one or two ideas of a form in her mind on each evening. On\nJanuary 9th also, the drawings of each of the three sets just described\nshow marked resemblances to one another. Consequently, the proba\nbility of a chance coincidence is not so great as the total number of\ndrawings would make it appear to be.\n'We have also to remember that, as Mr. Glardon informs us, there\nwas no written communication between agent and percipient during\nthis time, so that she did not know that he was using the same\ndiagram two days running. In answer to the question whether he\nattempted to transfer any diagrams to Mrs. M. on January 8th and\n9th, Mr. Glardon says (May 2nd, 1894) that he does not remember,\nbut he believes not.\nWe hope that the publication of these experiments may encourage\nother members of the Society to make similar attempts and record\nthem with equal care and precision. There is no other branch of\npsychical research in which experimentation is easier,\u2014though we\ncannot, of'course, be sure of obtaining any definite results in it\u2014and\nperhaps none in which results, if obtained at all, are of more lasting\nvalue.\nOASES.\nG. 251. Apparitions.\nThe following account of a \" haunted house \" was received a short\ntime ago by Mr. Barkworth.\nMrs. Dauntesey, of Ayecroft Hall, Manchester, writes to him :\u2014\nJune 15th, 1896.\nThe ghost seen at Ayecroft Hall is the figure of a woman, sometimes\nblack, and sometimes white. Only the back is generally seen\u2014the face has\nnever been seen. The figure has been seen in nearly all the rooms at\ndifferent times. I have only seen it once myself, some years ago. It was in\nbroad daylight, about 11 a.m. ; I was kneeling in a doorway, superintending\nits decoration for a party ; I looked up and saw the figure\u2014in black\u2014which\nappeared to have walked over me, through the doorway. It went through a\ndoor on the left into the hall. Two people were in there. I followed quickly\nand questioned the people in the room. The figure was not there, nor had\nthey seen anybody come in before me.\nIt has been seen in daylight since by a friend. I can give you his name\nand address : Theo. J. Bolland, Esq., Longreach, Keynsham, Somersetshire.\n\f330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEO., 1896.\nHe says he will be glad to answer any questions you may ask him. Also\nMr. Harrison ; I will send you his statement.\nMy husband has seen the figure a great many times, and friends who\nhave been staying with us, and servants have seen it. My husband has seen\nit at night. There is an archway from the hall (where we sit) into the\nentrance hall. [See plan.] There are two doors, one on right and one on\nleft of entrance hall, one is the drawing-room and the other the library. My\nhusband sitting in the hall, facing the entrance hall, has several times seen\na figure cross from the drawing-room door to the library, and on following\nit at once, has found nobody there. There was no other door to library.\nMy husband also saw it in daylight last summer in the same place.\nThere are strange noises heard about the house at times. We have\nfrequently thought we heard a carriage drive up to the door in the evening,\nand have gone out and seen nothing ; but we think this may be accounted\nfor by trains passing.\nThe appearance of the ghost has been followed by a death in either my\nhusband's family or my own in every case. We know of no story in con\nnection with the ghost, but my husband succeeded an old invalid lady, his\ncousin, and he had never seen her. She only lived at Ayecroft two months\nin the year.\nI had a very vivid experience of a ghost, at Buxton, in an old house,\nsome years ago. There was a story about that, and I described the man who\nappeared exactly, although I did not know anything about a ghost or any\nstory, before seeing it. ALJCE DAlINTESEy.\nMrs. Dauntesey enclosed the following two letters :\u2014\n(1) From Mr. Dauntesey.\nJune 16th, 1896.\nThe first time I saw the ghost at Ayecroft Hall was in 1885 or 1886. It\nwas in the evening, about 9 or 9.30. I went up to my wife's bedroom to\nfetch something. I thought I saw Mrs. Dauntesey's maid standing in front\nof the toilet-table, which stands in front of the window. I made no remark,\ngot what I wanted, and went downstairs again. I then said that I had seen\nthe maid in the bedroom. I was told that that could not be the case, as she\nwas at the theatre in Manchester. Enquiries were made as to whether any\nother servant had been up to the room. Supper was going on in the\nservants' hall, and the housekeeper assured me no one was absent from\nit. The figure was dressed in white, and appeared to be arranging the\ntoilet-table.\nThe second time, some years later, I was sitting in the hall alone. It\nwas about 11.30 p.m. The ladies had just gone upstairs, and two or three\nmen who were staying in the house had gone up also, to change their coats.\nI had sent the servants to bed. I saw a black figure coming from a door\nleading to back part of house [marked A in the plan]. It passed through\nthe archway to foot of staircase. At the moment I thought it was one of\nthe servants, but I remembered directly that I had heard them go through\nthe door already mentioned, and lock it after them.

There\nwere people talking at top of the stairs, so no one could have gone that way\nwithout being seen. There were two moderator lamps burning ; all other\nlights had been put out.\nUp to last year I had a very favourite fox terrier, who used to sleep in\nmy dressing-room.

On these occasions I always took her away to another room,\nwhen she would settle down at once. I searched the room thoroughly, but\ncould find nothing. I have slept in it several times when I have been\nalone. ROBERT DAUNTESEY.\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEC., 1896.\n(2) From Mr. E. Harrison, of Silverton, Silver-street, Enfield Town.\nHaving been asked to state what I saw of a so-called ghost while staying\nat Ayecroft Hall, Christmas, 1886, I will jot down, as far as I can\nremember, what took place.\nAfter dressing for dinner, I was on my way downstairs\u2014a short flight\nleading to lobby between smoking-room and hall, which had small window\nlooking into garden at one end, and inner and outer doors leading into\ncourtyard at the other, [marked B and C in plan] both of which were shut\u2014\nwhen I saw a white figure pass the foot of the stairs, going towards the hall\nand smoking-room (the doors of which face each other), which I took to be\none of the maids, and on reaching the bottom was surprised not to see\nher, as I was so close behind her. I opened the door and went into the hall,\nwhere I found a lady visitor standing in front of the fire. I asked her if she\nhad seen one of the maids in white pass. Her reply was \" No one has been\nhere, and you know at this time of the day all the servants are dressed.\" I\nat once looked into the smoking-room, but it was empty.\nI took so little notice of what I thought to be one of the housemaids,\nthat I am quite unable to give any description of the figure in detail, but as\nno one was in the passage, and no person passed through the hall, I can\nonly conclude that I saw a ghost.\nMr. Harrison explained by a plan sent later the exact part of the\nhouse in which he had seen the figure.\nIn answer to questions, Mrs. Dauntesey writes :\u2014\nJune 26*, [1896].\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I am very glad to answer any questions you may wish to\nask. I have never heard that any of the people who saw the ghost at\nAyecroft had any of the symptoms you describe ; they appeared to be\nstartled only, and not even frightened.\nMy husband says that there was no gradual development from mist or\nshadow of the form he saw ; it appeared as you describe it, full-blown,\nexactly as a living person would. . As far as I know, this was the case when\nothers saw it. My husband says he saw the apparition about six times,\nbut in the two instances he mentioned to you the figure was very much\nmore distinct than in the others. The appearances have spread over the\n14J years that we have been married. We never heard of anything being\nseen before then ; but, as I told you, we were not likely to hear or know any\nthing about the house. My husband is of a very calm temperament, who\nlooks the very last person one would connect with a ghost-story. He is\nabsolutely \"without nerves \" as we say, and not in the least imaginative. I\nam of a very nervous temperament myself, and am very often wakeful at\nnight, and yet I have only seen the ghost at Ayecroft once.\nI hear that last week my head housemaid, a woman of over 30, had a\nfit of hysterics, caused by, as she says, a ghost walking along the passage\noutside her room. She is firmly convinced that it was no human footfall\nshe heard. She was a new servant, as, strangely enough, all the others are,\n\fDEc., 1896.] Cases. 333\nand my housekeeper assures me that nothing was known by any of them\nabout the house being \" haunted.\" It is a strange thing, but everybody\nwho has seen or heard a ghost at Ayecroft, seems to be absolutely certain\nthat what they heard or saw was supernatural, and no amount of persuasion,\nof suggesting of other causes, will move them. I should prefer not to\nask this woman to write her experience down, as it is important for me\nnot to frighten the servants, and it would do so if I were to speak of it to\nthem.\nI could, however, get you an account written by a former housemaid,\nwho saw the ghost distinctly eleven years ago. She has been married\nsome time, and would not be likely to be writing to any of the present\nservants.\nWith regard to the ghost I saw at Buxton, I can affirm that I had no\nidea that a ghost had ever been seen in those rooms, or that anybody had\nhanged himself over the banisters. I had heard some years before, but had\nentirely forgotteit it, that in another part of the house, downstairs, ' ' a little\ngrey lady \" passed through a swing door. I am sure this had no connection\nwith the experience I had. My ghost was an old gentleman dressed as I\nhave described, and my mother-in-law told me some years after, and before I\ntold her of my experience, that this old gentleman had been seen in the very\ndoorway I mention. It had not been spoken of for many years, and\nmy husband, who had lived there for many years of his early life, had\nentirely forgotten it. It certainly had never been mentioned to me. I had\nhad an attack of faintness at the dinner table, and had gone up to my room\nto lie down, when I looked up and saw it. It was not quite dusk, but not\nbroad daylight.\nALICE DAUNTESEY.\nMrs. Dauntesey sent us later an account obtained from the servant\nreferred to above, as follows :\u2014\nIt happened one night during the summer months, when the house had\nto be lighted up about nine. As I walked up the passage towards the east\nroom, a shadow of a lady dressed in white fell on the door, just as if she was\nwalking out of the room, and I stepped back to allow her to pass, when it all\nat once disappeared, and on going into the room I found the door closed and\nno one there.\nSUSAN Boss.\nI believe she means that the door was locked ; she told me that.\u2014A. D.\nAnother of the percipients mentioned in Mrs. Dauntesey's first\nletter writes to Mr. Barkworth in July, 1896 :\u2014\nWith regard to the apparition which I saw at Ayecroft Hall, the follow\ning is the story :\u2014I was staying in the house some time in November, 1892,\nand one evening, having gone to my room to dress for dinner before the\nothers, I was coming downstairs again, about 7.15, and on my way down I\nsaw a girl in white come out of the drawing-room, pass the end of the staircase\nand go into the library, which is opposite the drawing-room. [See plan.] I was\n\f334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEO., 1896.\nnot in the least startled, as I supposed one of the ladies in the house must\nhave also come down early. I followed her into the library, but was\nsurprised on entering to see no one present. There is only one door into\nthe room and she could not have come out again without my seeing her. I\ntold Mr. Dauntesey what I had seen, and he said several others had seen the\nsame. I had never previously heard about there being any ghost ; if I had\ndone so, I should have looked at her more carefully. As it was, it never\nentered my head that it was anything unnatural. I have never seen it\nsince, though I have often stayed in the house.\nTHEO. J. BOLLAND.\nThe two following letters from Mrs. and Mr. Dauntesey give some\nfurther details of her experience at Buxton and of the apparition seen\nat Ayecroft Hall.\nAyecroft Hall, Manchester, Jtdy 17th, [1896].\n[As to] the ghost I saw at Buxton, the old gentleman I'saw was dressed\nin a dark blue cloth coat, with brass buttons ; the coat was cut away very\nmuch as an ordinary dress coat is now-a-days. He had a white necktie\nwound round and round his neck, of the kind described, I believe, as a\n\"choker,\" with a tiny bow in front.\nWhat I heard afterwards was this : that an old man who lived in the\nhouse a great many years ago, hanged himself over the banisters, and that\n20 years previously to the time I saw the ghost, he had often appeared and\nhad frightened the nursemaids. He had appeared exactly where I saw him.\nI feel quite certain that I had never heard the story until after I saw the\nfigure, and it was two years after. My mother-in-law had left Wyelands for\nmany years, and had gone back to it again to live, and that is the reason, I\nsuppose, why the story had died out.\nALICE DAUNTESEY.\nAyecroft Hall, Manchester, August 19th, 1896.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014In answer to your first question, the ghost was seen shortly\nbefore my little daughter's death, first by myself in my wife's room one\nevening, and about a week after by the housemaid (now Mrs. Boss), whose\naccount you have already received. On another occasion an aunt of my\nwife's died between two and three months after it was seen by Mr. Harrison.\nOn the other occasions when it has been seen, a death has occurred either\nin my wife's or my family shortly after. During the last three years my\nwife has had the misfortune to lose three near relations, her father, a\nbrother, and a sister. During that time the ghost was seen certainly\nthree times, if not more. Mr. Harrison and Mrs. Dauntesey both saw it\nin the same part of the house. I enclose a plan of that part. You will\nsee by the plan that the only direction in which a living person could have\ngot away was through the [hall, the door marked B being locked] and on each\noccasion there were people in that room who said no one had entered it.\nWith regard to what my wife saw at Buxton, we have asked my mother\nif she knew of any one, now living, who saw the figure before ; she says\n\fDEc., 3896.] Oases. 335\nshe does not know of anybody, as the nurses, who alone seem to have seen\nthe ghost then, she has long since lost sight of. The date at which my\nwife saw it was in July, 1890.\nROBERT DAUNTESEY.\n(1 252. \" Haunted House.\"\nThe following account of similar apparitions seen several times in\nthe same house, in Dublin, by various persons, was sent to us by Mrs.\nSt. George, of 2, Jervis Place, Clonmel, an Associate of the Society,\nwho had been an active worker for the Census of Hallucinations. The\naddress of the house and the names of the percipients, who are friends\nof hers, were given us in confidence. She writes :\u2014\nJuly Wth, [1895].\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I received the enclosed this morning from my friends, the\nMiss R.'s. Miss M. R. has had at least five different experiences, and Miss\nA. R. has had nearly as many. Every member of the family has heard or\nseen \"something.\" Mrs. R. has heard the billiard balls being knocked\nabout constantly during the night. They used to have a table in the large\nroom over their stables, before the latter were let ; it was in this room and\non the stairs going down to what were formerly the stables that the \" Grey\nLady \" has been so constantly seen by members of the family, and also by\nthe two sets of tenants who have been, and are, occupying these quarters.\nThe latter now always keep a light burning all night, and since say they see\nnothing. Since the billiard table was sold, and the place let, no sound of\nballs being knocked about, as if a game were being played, has been heard.\nThe noise has been heard by nearly all the family. Mrs. R.'s mother,\nMrs. H., the Miss R.'s told me, also \"saw \"things, but this old lady is\ndead.\nThe accounts given by the different members of the family\nfollow.*\n(1) From Mr. J. R.\nJuly 9t\/i, 1895.\nAt , Dublin, one evening, about 1878, in the twilight I was walking\nupstairs with a pair of shoes in my hand, when passing a landing on which\nthere was a pedestal with a bust of Wm. Shakespeare on it, I saw a tall lady\ndressed in grey suddenly appear before me and stand in front of the pedestal,\nwhich became hidden\u2014which would prove it was not a \"vapoury vision\" I\nsaw. I was so surprised and frightened at the extreme suddenness of the\nfigure that I involuntarily threw my shoes at it, when the figure immediately\n* These accounts were written on the \"B forms\" used for the Census of\nHallucinations and are therefore in the form of answers to set questions. I have\nadded words in square brackets to make the narratives continuous.\u2014ED.\n\f336 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEO., 1896.\nvanished, my shoes striking the pedestal and seeming to pass through the\nimpression. I was unnerved a good deal.\nI was in the best of health at the time. About 15 years [old].\nThe face was not familiar [to me].\nNo [other persons were present].\nI have since then frequently had the same impression of the same\nfigure\u2014always in grey. I now anticipate a certain amount of pleasure in the\nhope of seeing her, as the face was always kindly disposed.\nWe all call this figure the \" Grey Lady,\" as several of us have seen her.\nI had occasion to let my stabling for some months last year, and the\ntenant informed me several times that there was another person in the place\nbesides himself\u2014a grey lady\u2014but she seemed always pleased to see him, but\nwould never speak, disappearing if spoken to.\n(2) From Mr. C. B.\nJuly 8th, 1895.\nI was standing one afternoon, some years ago, at the top landing of the\nhouse, , Dublin, when I distinctly saw a tall lady, completely dressed in\ngrey, walking up the top flight of stairs towards me. I was rather surprised,\nbut not at all frightened, as she looked quite like an ordinary mortal. She\nturned to the left when she reached the top and smiling at me entered a\nroom through a closed door. I immediately opened the door, but found no\none there. (It was broad daylight at the time.)\nI was talking to a nurse at the time. I was about 11 or 12 years old. I\nwas in perfect health. The impression resembled nobody I ever saw before.\nWhen I asked [the nurse] did she see any one, she replied she saw a light\npassing by towards the door.\nI was sleeping in the room referred to, when one morning I saw a face\nlooking round the door and smiling at me. This occurred some years before\nthe first written impression, but I am certain it was the same face as the\nlady in grey had. I have frequently heard unaccountable noises in this\nroom ; others have also heard them.\n(3) From Miss A. B.\nJuly 8th, 1895.\nI was sitting in the front drawing-room of , Dublin, some years ago,*\none Sunday evening, about 7.30, in summer, when I saw a tall woman,\ndraped all in grey, standing in the archway dividing the rooms. The face\nwas rather indistinct. I was startled and exclaimed, \"Do you see that?\" to\na lady who was also in the room, (and whose house we were in) but as I\nspoke, the figure disappeared.\nI had been suffering from severe toothache all the evening ; otherwise\nwas in excellent health ; was 17 or 18 [years old]. I had never seen any one\nat all resembling the figure, which looked something like a nun. One lady\nwas in the room, but she saw nothing.\n* Miss A. R. afterwards informed us that the date was about 1879.\n\fDEO., 1896.] Cases. 337\nI never saw the \" Grey Lady \" before or since, but she has been seen in\nour house, which is next door to the house where I saw her. A maid, who\nwas carrying water upstairs, one evening, let the can fall and screamed, and\nwhen questioned as to the reason, said that \" a lady all in grey \" had passed\nher on the staircase and frightened her, as she was a stranger.\nWe used to have the large front upper room in our stable fitted up as a\nbilliard room, and the harness room underneath was used by my brothers as\na \"workshop.\" Having gone out to the latter one night,\u2014as well as I\nremember in the autumn of 1883, \u2014with a younger sister and the nursery\nmaid, we distinctly heard footsteps walking about the room overhead and\nthe unmistakable \"click\" of billiard balls. Being determined to find out\nwho was playing (having constantly heard the sound of \"cannoning\" from\nour house) we went quietly up the stairs, and saw light in the billiard room\nthrough glass panes, which were set into the top of the door, but which\nwere too high up for any of us to see through ; reaching the door, we burst it\nopen, and nothing but darkness greeted us. There was no other exit to the\nroom, only the door we came in by. Needless to say we returned quicker\nthan we came !\nAll the members of my family have heard the \"click\" of the balls,\n(myself included), but since we no longer have the billiard table, no more\nsounds are heard. It was in that very room and on those stairs, that the\npeople who had rented our stables saw the \" Grey Lady.\" They had never\nheard of the report, as this is not a reputed haunted house, very few persons\nknowing we have ever seen anything ; even my mother does not know. We\nnever told her, as she is naturally nervous ; but she has often heard the\nbilliard balls.\n(4) From Miss M. E.\nJuly 18ft, 1895.\nMy sister has explained how and where our billiard room was situated.\nOne evening,\u2014I think about September, 1883,\u2014my sister A. , a nursery-maid,\nand myself were in the \"workshop ; \" while there we heard footsteps over\nhead of people walking round the table, apparently playing billiards, as we\nheard the balls cannoning. On coming out of the \" workshop \" we saw the\nbilliard room was lit up, so we crept upstairs, thinking we would surprise\nthe players ; the door had two panes of glass on top. When we got to the\ntop of the stairs we saw light through them, but on opening the door the\nroom was in utter darkness. We thought they had put out the light, but\nturned and fled into the house, and then discovered that no one had been\nout there. My sister and the maid both saw and heard exactly as I did.\nVery nearly the same thing occurred once again when I was quite alone.\nI could not possibly say how often I have seen light in the billiard room\nfrom our back windows, when I knew no one was out there ; and I may\nsafely say a day never passed during the time we had the billiard table that\nthe balls were not heard \" clicking.\" I have heard it from the garden when\nwith two or three other people, and have gone up to find the room empty\nand the table covered. Since the stable has been let, not one of us has\n\f338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEc., 1896.\nheard the sound of balls. Whether the \"Grey Lady\" played \"dummy\"\nbilliards or not, I am not in a position to say.\nI was a small child, and was coming upstairs to my nursery, which was\non the top landing, when on the last flight of stairs and in view of the door\nof the room I saw a little old countrywoman (with a frilled cap under her\nbonnet and a shawl) standing in the doorway. At first I thought she was\nmy nurse's mother, who was in the habit of coming to see us ; but when I\ncame nearer, I found she was some one I had never seen before. She smiled\nat me, and though I was not the least frightened, I turned and ran down\nstairs\u2014I fancy because I was shy and did not like strangers. Afterwards I\nheard no stranger had been in the house. I never saw her again, and\nthough many years ago, I should know the face if I ever did meet her.\nOne night in November, 1894, when we had all gone up to our bedrooms,\nI wanted something out of the drawing-room. As all the lights were out, I\nbrought down a candle. When I opened the drawing-room door, I saw\n\" something,\" I really don't know what, but it was a sort of shadow leaning\nover a table in the window. However, it gave me such a fright that I\ndropped my candle and ran upstairs to my sister's room. She asked me\nwhat had frightened me so much ; I then told her what I had seen. She\noffered to come down with me and see what it was ; but I thought it better\nto go alone, so went down again without a light, and when I was in the room\nI struck a match and picked up my candle, &c., and looked all round, but\nthere was nothing of any kind visible.\nIn reply to further enquiries, Mrs. St. George writes :\u2014\nJuly Wth, [1895].\nI don't think any of the family knew the house was haunted when they\ntook it. The children must have been very young at the time. Certainly,\nthe tenants who took the stable where the billiard table used to be, did\nnot know anything about it. The stables are some distance from the\nkitchen, but connected with the house by a passage and narrow stair up to\nthe room over the stables where the billiard table was. It is in this room,\nwhere the present tenants sleep, that they always keep a light burning, as\nthey say they never see anything with a light, but always did so when they\nwent to the room without. The \"Grey Lady\" would come out, and pass\nthem on the stairs. . . . The Miss R.'s and their brothers have had\nseveral experiences in other houses also. . . .\nI never saw the tenants,\u2014[there were] two sets of them, \u2014but only\nheard from several of the R.'s that each of them had constantly seen the\n\"Grey Lady \" and heard the footsteps on the stairs . . .\nELSIE ST. GEORGE.\nMiss M. R. writes further to Mrs. St. George :\u2014\nJuly ISth [1895].\nIn reply to Professor Sidgwick's letters, I have never seen the ' ' Grey\nLady,\" so can tell nothing about her. I have not an idea of the date when I\nsaw the little old countrywoman ; it was in broad daylight. The house is\n\fDEc., 1896.] Supplementary Library Catalogue. 339\nnot reputed to be haunted ; in fact, as we told you, mother has no idea we\never saw anything, and as she is so very nervous, we never talk to her about\nthese things. She has often heard the \"billiard balls.\" Our present\nservants have never seen anything, nor do they know that we have, so they\ncould not have told the tenants of the stable. It would be quite impossible\nto get any testimony from the latter. Our servants have heard the house\nbells ring when there was no one in the house ; in fact, about six weeks ago,\nthey heard the office (at least, what used to be the office, the front room)\nbell ring, and on going upstairs there was no one in the room. Anne (the\nparlourmaid) went through every room in the house, for though she knew\nwe were all out, she thought one of the boys might have come in and wanted\nsomething ; however, she found no one. That is the second time she has\nheard the same bell ring, which is not often, as she [has been] with us over\nseven years. I would not like to ask her to write her account, as if she thought\nthe house was haunted or anything of that kind, she might leave us, and she\nis quite too invaluable to risk such a thing. Up to the second time of the\nbell ringing, she had no objection to staying in the house alone, even in the\nevening ; now she does not like it in the daytime, and refuses to stay quite\nalone in the evening.\nOf course, we all (excepting mother) know of the \"Grey Lady,\" as\nC was a small boy in the nursery when he first saw her ; in fact, we (he\nand I) were both children in bed the first time. I remember him saying\nto me, \"Did you see that woman with a long neck and dressed in grey,\nwho has just looked in at us ? \" I sat up in bed, but never saw her, and she\ndid not come again. We told all the family about her, and to this day he\nremembers her vividly.\nI must say that, though I have seen and heard \"things,\" I do not\nbelieve in anything supernatural, and it was for fear that I should lose my\nnerve that I went down alone that night to the drawing-room.\nSUPPLEMENTARY LIBRARY CATALOGUE.\nAdditions since the last list (JOURNAL for June, 1896).\nTHE EDMUND GURNEY LIBRARY.\nBRAMWELL (J.
