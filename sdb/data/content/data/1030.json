Hiftory\ncannot ftoop to the meannefs of examin-\ning the materials of which Memoirs are\ngenerally compofed.\nAnd yet the pleafure and benefit re-\nfulting from fuch books, are manifeft to\nevery reader.\nI hope the admirers of the very labo-\nrious Thomas Hearne will pardon me, if\nI fhould venture to give it as my opinion,\nand with much deference to their judg-\nment, that William Lilly's Life and Death\nof Charles the firft, contains more ufeful\nmatter of inftruflion, as well as more\nplendid and ftriking occurrences, than\nare to be found in feveral of thofe monk-\nifh\n\f( 5 )\nifh volumes publifhed by that learned\nOxonian,\nLilly affords us many curious parti-\nculars relating to the life of that un-\nfortunate Prince, which are no where elfe\nto be found. In delineating the cha-\nracter of Charles, he feems difpaffionate\nand impartial, and indeed it agrees per-\nfectly with the general portraiture of\nhim, as it is drawn by our moft authentic\nHiftorians.\nThe Hiftory of Lilly's Life and Times\nis certainly one of the moft entertaining\nnarratives in our language. With refpedt\nto the fcience he profefled of calculating\nnativities, calling figures, the prediction\nof events, and other appendages of Aftro-\nlogy, he would fain make us think that\nhe was a very folemn and ferious Believer,\nIndeed, fuch is the manner o\u00a3 telling his\nftory, that fometimes the Reader may\npoffibly be induced to fuppofe Lilly ra-\nther an Enthufiaft than an Impoftor. He\nrelates\n\f( 6 )\nrelates many anecdotes of the pretenders\nto foretell events, raife fpirits, and other\nimpoftures, with fuch feeming candor,\nand with fuch an artlefs fimplicity of\nflyle, that we are almoft perfuaded to take\nhis word when he protefts fuch an in-\nviolable refpeft to truth and fincerity.\nThe powerful genius of Shakefpeare\ncould carry him triumphantly through\nfubjedts the moll unpromifing, and fa-\nbles the moft improbable : we therefore\ncannot wonder at the fuccefs of fuch of\nhis plays, where the magic of witches,\nand the incantation of fpirits are defcribed,\nor where the power of Fairies is intro-\nduced ; when fuch was the Credulity of\nthe times refpefting thefe imaginary Be-\nings, and when that belief was made a\nfcience of, and kept alive by artful and\nfuperftitious, knavifh and enthufiaftic\nteachers ; what Lilly relates of thefe peo-\nple, confidered only as matter of faft, is\nfurely very curious.\nTo\n\f( 7 )\nTo conclude ; I know no Record but\nthis where we can find fo juft, and fo enter-\ntaining a Hiftory of Do&or Dee, Doftor\nForman, Booker, Winder, Kelly, Evans,\n(Lilly's Matter) the famous William Poole,\nand Captain Bubb Fifke, Sarah Shelborne,\nand many others.\nTo thefe we may add,' the uncommon\neffects of the Cryftal, the appearance of\nQueen Mabb, and other ftrange and mi-\nraculous, operations, which owe their ori-\ngin to folly, curiofity, fuperftition, bi-\ngotry and impofture.\nT. D\n\f\fTHE\nLIFE\nX> F\nWILLIAM LILLY,\nStudent in astrology.\nWrote by himfelf in the 66th Year of his Age,\nat Hersham, in the Parifh of Walton\nupon Thames, in the County of Surry.\nPropria Mann.\nI WAS born in the county of Leices-\nter, in an obfcure town, in the north-\nweft borders thereof, called Difeworth,\nfeven miles fouth of the town of Derby,\none mile from Caftle-Donnington, a town\nof great rudenefs, wherein it is not re-\nmembered that any of the farmers thereof\ndid ever educate any of their fons to learn-\ning, only my grandfather fent his younger\nB .\n'\nfon\n\f2 Mr. Lilly's History\nfon to Cambridge, whofe name was Ro-\nbert Lilly , and died Vicar of Cambden in\nGloucefterihire, about 1640.\nThe town of Difeworth did formerly\nbelong unto the Lord Seagrave, for there\nis one record in the hands of my coufin\nMelborn Williamfon, which mentions\none acre of land abutting north upon the\ngates of the Lord Seagrave ; and there is\none clofe, called Hall-clofe, wherein the\nruins of fome ancient Buildings appear,\nand particularly where the dove-houfe\nftood ; and there is alfo the ruins of de-\ncayed fifh-ponds and other outhoufes.\nThis town came at length to be the inhe-\nritance of Margaret, Countefs of Rich-\nmond, Mother of Henry VII. which\nMargaret gave this town and lordfhip of\nDifeworth unto Chrift's College in Cam-\nbridge, the Mafter and Fellows whereof\nhave ever lince, and at prefent, enjoy and\npoflefs it.\nIn the church of this town there is but\none monument, and that is a white mar-\nble ftone, now almoft broken to pieces,\nwhich was placed there by Robert Lilly,\nmy grandfather, in memory of Jane his\nwife, the daughter of Mr. Poole of Dal-\nby, in the fame county, a family now\nquite extinguifhed. My grandmother's\nbrother was Mr. Henry Poole, one of the\nKnights of Rhodes, or Templars, who\n\fof his* Life and Times. 3\nbeing a foldier at Rhodes at the taking\nthereof by Solyman the Magnificent, and\nefcaping with his life, came afterwards to\nEngland, and married the Lady Parron\nor Perham, of Oxfordshire, and was cal-\nled, during his life, Sir Henry Poole.\nWilliam Poole the Aftrologer knew him\nvery well, and remembers him to have\nbeen a very tall perfon, and reputed of\ngreat ftrength in his younger years.\nThe impropriation of this town of\nDifeworth was formerly the inheritance of\nthree filters, whereof two became vota-\nries j one in the nunnery of Langly in\nthe parifh of Difeworth, valued at the\nfuppreflion, I mean the whole nunnery,\nat thirty-two pounds per annum, and this\nfillers part is yet enjoyed by the family of\nthe Grayes, who now, and for fome years\npaft, have the enjoyment and poffeffion\nof all the lands formerly belonging to the\nnunnery in the parifh of Difeworth, and\nare at prefent of the yearly value of three\nhundred and fifty pounds per annum.\nOne of the fillers gave her part of the\ngreat tithes unto a religious houfe in Bre-\ndon upon the Hill ; and, as the inhabi-\ntants report, became a religious perfon\nafterwards.\nThe third fifter married, and her part\nof the tithes in fucceeding ages became the\nB z garl\n\f4 Mi'. Lilly's History\nEarl of Huntingdon's, who not many\nyears nnce fold it to one of his fervants.\nThe donation of the vicarage is in the\ngift of the Grayes of Langley, unto whom\nthey pay yearly, (I mean unto the Viear)\nas I am informed, fix pounds per annum.\nVery lately fome charitable citizens have\npurchafed one third portion of the tithes,\nand given it for a maintenance of a preach-\ning minifter, and it is now of the value\nof about fifty pounds per annum.\nThere have been two hermitages in this\nparifh the laft hermit was well remem-\nbered by one Thomas Cooke, a very an-\ncient inhabitant, who in my younger years\nacquainted me therewith.\nThis town of Difewr\north is divided into\nthree parifhes ; one part belongs unto\nLockington, in which part ftandeth my\nfather's houfe, over-againft the weft end\nof the fteeple, in which I was born: fome\nother farms are in the parifh of Bredon,\nthe reft in the parifh of Difeworth.\nIn this town, but in the parifh of Lock-\nington, was I born, the firft day of May,\n1602.\nMy father's name was William Lilly,\nfon of Robert, the fon of Robert, the foil\nof Rowland, &c. My mother was Alice,\nthe daughter of Edward Barham, of Fif-\nkerton Mills, in Nottinghamfhire, two\nmiles from Newark upon Trent: this Ed-\nward\n\for his Life and Times. $\nward Barham was born in Norwich, and\nwell remembered the rebellion of Kett the\nTanner, in the days of Edward VI.\nOur family have continued many ages\nin this town as yeomen ; befides the farm\nmy father and his anceftors lived in, both\nmy father and grandfather had much free\nland, and many houfes in the town, not\nbelonging to the college, as the farm\nwherein they were all born doth, and is\nnow at this prefent of the value of forty\npounds per annum, and in poffeffion of\nmy brother's fon ; but the freehold land\nand houfes, formerly purchafed by my an-\nceftors, were all fold by my grandfather\nand father; fo that now our family depend\nwholly upon a college leafe. Of my in-*\nfancy I can fpeak little, only I do remem-\nber that in the fourth year of my age I\nhad the meafles.'\nI was, during my minority, put to learn\nat fuch fchools, and of fuch matters, as\nthe rudenefs of the place and country af-r\nforded ; my mother intending I (hould be\na fcholar from my infancy, feeing my fa-\nther's backflidings in the world, and no\nhopes by plain hufbandry to recruit a de-\ncayed eftate j therefore upon Trinity Tuef-\nday, 1 6 1 3, my father had me to Afhby de\nla Zouch, to be inftrufted by one Mr.\nJohn Brinfley; one, in thofe times, of\ngreat abilities for inftru6tion of youth in\nB 3 the\n\f6 Mr. Lilly's History\nthe Latin and Greek tongues ; he was ve-\nry fevere in his life and cqnverfation, and\ndid breed up many fcholars for the uni-\nverfities : in religion he was a ftrift Puri-\ntan, not conformable wholly to the cere-\nmonies of the Church of England. In\nthis town of Afhby de la Zouch, for many\nyears together, Mr. Arthur Hilderfham\nexercifed his minillry at my being there\n;\nand all the while I continued at Afhby, he\nwas filenced. This is that famous Hil-\nderfham, who left behind him a commen-\ntary on the fifty-firft Pfalm -\n} as alfq many\nfermons upon the fourth of John, both\nwhich are printed : he was an excellent\ntextuary, of exemplary life, pleafant in\ndifcourfe, a ftrong enemy to the Brown-\nifts, and diflented not from the Church\nof England in any article of faith, but\nonly about wearing the furplice, baptiz-\ning with the crofs, and kneeling at the\nfacrament ; moft of the people in the\ntown were directed by his judgment, and\nfo continued, and yet do continue prefby-\nterianly affefted ; for when the Lord of\nLoughborough in 1642, 1643, 1644, and\n1645, had his garrifon in that town, if\nby chance at any time any troops of horfe\nhad lodged within the town, though they\ncame late at night to their quarters ; yet\nwould one or other of the town prefently\ngive Sir John Gell of Derby notice, fo\n2 that\n\fOF HIS LlLE AND TlMES. 7\nthat ere next morning mod of his Maje-\nfty's troops were feized in their lodgings,\nwhich moved the Lord of Loughborough\nmerrily to fay, there was not a fart let in\nAfby but it was prefently carried to Derby,\nThe feveral authors I there learned were\nthefe, viz. Sententise Pueriles, Cato, Cor-\nderius, iEfop's Fables, Tully's Offices,\nOvid de Triftibus ; laftly, Virgil, then\nHorace ; as alfo Camden's Greek Gram-\nmar, Theognis and Homer's Iliads : I\nwas only entered into Udall's Hebrew\nGrammar; he never taught Logick, but\noften would fay it was fit to be learned in\nthe univerfities,\nIn the fourteenth year of my age, by a\nfellow fcholar of fwarth, black complexion?\nI had like to have my right eye beaten\nout as we were at play ; the fame year,\nabout Michaelmas, I got a furfeit, and\nthereupon a fever, by eating beech-nuts.\nIn the fixteenth year of my age I was\nexceedingly troubled in my dreams con-\ncerning my falvation and damnation, and\nalfo concerning the fafety and deftruc-\ntion of the fouls of my father and mo-\nther; in the nights I frequently wept,\nprayed and mourned, for fear my fins\nmight offend God.\nIn the feventeenth year of my age my\nmother died.\nB 4 In\n\f8 Mr. Lilly's History\nv\nIn the eighteenth year of my age my\nmafter Brinfley was enforced from keep-\ning fchool, being perfecuted by the Bi-\nfhop's officers, he came to London, and\nthen lectured in London, where he after-\nwards died. In this ye^r, by reafon of\nmy father's poverty, I was alfo enforced\nto leave fchool, and fo came to my father's\nhoufe, where I lived in much penury for.\none year, and taught fchool one quarter\nof a year, until God's providence pro-\nvided better for mp.\nFor the two laft y^ars of my being at\nfchool, I was of the higheft form in the\nfchool, and chiefeft of that form ; I could\nthen fpeak Latin as well as Englifh ; could\nmake extempore verfes upon any theme\n;\nall kinds of verfes, Hexameter, Pentame-\nter, Phaleuciacks, Iambicks, Sapphicks,\n&c. fo that if any fcholars from remote\nfchools came to difpute, I was ringleader\nto difpute with them ; I could cap ver-\nfes, &c. If any minifter came to exa-\nmine us, I was brought forth againft him,\nnor would I argue with him unlefs in the\nLatin tongue, which I found few of them\ncould well fpeak without breaking Prif-\ncian's head \u2022 which, if once they did, I\nwould complain to my mafter, Non bene\nintelligit linguam Latinam, nec prorfus loqui-\ntur. In the derivation of words, I found\nmoft\n\fof his Life and Times. 9\nmoft of them defective, nor indeed were\nany of them good grammarians : all and\nevery of thofe fcholars who were of my\nform and ftanding, went to Cambridge\nand proved excellent divines, only poor I,\nWilliam Lilly, was not fo happy ; for-\ntune then frowning upon father's prefent\ncondition, he not in any capacity to\nmaintain me at the univerfity.\nOf the Manner how I came unto\nLondon.\nWorthy fir, I take much delight to\nrecount unto you, even all and every\ncircumftance of my life, whether good,\nmoderate, or evil ; Deo gloria.\nMy father had one Samuei Smatty for\nhis Attorney, unto whom I went fundry\ntimes with letters, who perceiving I was\na fcholar, and that I lived miferably in\nthe country, lofing my time, nor any\nways likely to do better, if I continued\nthere ; pitying my condition, he fent word\nfor me to come and fpeak with him, and\ntold me that he had lately been at Lon-\ndon, where there was a gentleman wanted\na youth, to attend him and his wife, who\ncould write, &c.\nI acquainted my father with it, who\nw^s very willing to be rid pf me, for I\ncould\n\fio Mr. Lilly's History\ncould not work, drive the plough, or\nendure any country labour; my fa-\nther oft would fay, I was good for no-\nthing.\nI had only twenty {hillings, and no\nmore, to buy me a new fuit, hofe, dou-\nblet, &c. my doublet was fuftian : I re-\npaired to Mr. Smatty, when I was ac-\ncoutred, for a letter to my matter, which\nhe gave me.\nUpon ft\/Tonday, April 3, 1620, I de-\nparted from Difeworth, and came to Lei-\ncefter : but I muft acquaint you, that\nbefore I came away I vifited my friends,\namongft whom I had given me about\nten fhillings, which was a great comfort\nunto me. On Tuefday, April the 4th,\nI took leave of my father, then in Lei-\ncefter gaol for debt, and came along with\nBradfhaw the carrier, the fame perfon\nwith whom many of the Duke of Bucking-\nham's kindred had come up with. Hark\nhow the waggons crack with their rich\nlading ! It was a very ftormy week, cold\nand uncomfortable : I footed it all along\n;\nwe could not reach London until Palm-\nSunday, the 9th of April, about half an\nhour after three in the afternoon, at\nwhich time we entered Smithfield. When\nI had gratified the carrier and his fer-\nvants, I had feven fhillings and fix pence\nleft, and no more ; one fuit of cloaths\nupon\n\fof his Life and Times. ii\nupon my back, two fhirts, three bands,\none pair of fhoes, and as many ftockings.\nUpon the delivery of my letter my mafter\nentertained me, and next day bought\nme a new cloak, of which you may ima-\ngine (good Efquire) whether I was not\nproud of ; befides, I faw and eat good\nwhite bread, contrary to our diet in Lei-\ncefterfhire. My matter's name was Gil-\nbert Wright, born at Market Bofworth\nin Leicefterfhire ; my miftrefs was born\nat Afhby de la Zouch, in the fame county,\nand in the town where I had gone to>\nfchool. This Gilbert Wright could nei-\nther write nor read; he lived upon his\nannual rents, was of no calling or pro-\nfeffion ; he had for many years been fer-\nvant to the Lady Pawlet in Hertfordfhire\n;\nand when Serjeant Puckering was made\nLord keeper, he made him keeper of his\nlodgings at Whitehall. When Sir Tho-\nmas Egerton was made Lord Chancellor,\nhe entertained him in the fame place ; and\nwhen he married a widow in Newgate\nMarket, the Lord Chancellor recom-\nmended him to the company of Salters,\nLondon, to admit him into their com-\npany, and fo they did, and my mafter in\n1624, was mafter of that company; he\nwas a man of excellent natural parts, and\nwould fpeak publickly upon any occafion\nvery rationally and to the purpofe. I\nwrite\n\f12 Mr. Lilly's History\nwrite this, that the world may know he\nwas no taylor, or myfelf of that or any\nother calling or profeffion : My work was\nto go before my mafter to church ; to at-\ntend my mafter when he went abroad\n;\nto make clean his fhoes ; fweep theftreet;\nhelp to drive bucks when we wafhed;\nfetch water in a tub from the Thames :\nI have helped to carry eighteen tubs of\nwater in one morning, weed the garden\n;\nall manner of drudgeries I willingly per-\nformed ;\nfcrape trenchers, &c. If I had\nany profeffion, it was of this nature : I\nfhould never have denied my being a tay-\nlor, had I been one ; for there is no cal-\nling fo bafe, which by God's mercy may\nnot afford a livelihood ; and had not my\nmafter entertained me, I would have been\nof a very mean profeffion ere I would\nhave returned into the country again\n;\nfo here ends the aftions of eighteen years\nof my life.\nMy mafter married his fecond wife for\nher eftate ; flie was competently rich y\nfhe married him for confiderations he\nperformed not, (nofturnal fociety) fo\nthat they lived very uncomfortably ; fhe\nwas about feventy years of age, he fixty\nfix or more ;\nyet never was any woman\nmore jealous of a hufband than fhe ; in-\nfcmuch, that whenfoever he went into\nLondon, fhe was confident of his going\nto\n\fof his Life and Times. fc\nrj\nto women; by thofe means my life was\nthe more uncomfortable, it being very\ndifficult to pleafe two fuch oppofite na-\ntures : However, as to the things of this\nworld I had enough, and endured their\ndifcontents with much ferenenefs. My\nmiftrefs was very curious to know of fuch\nas were then called cunning or wife men,\nwhether fhe fhould bury her hulband ?\nShe frequently vifited fuch perfons, and\nthis occafion begot in me a little defire to\nlearn fomething that way, but wanting\nmoney to buy books, I laid afide thefe\nmotions, and endeavoured 4\nto pleafe both\nmafter and miftrefs.\nOf my Miftrefs' s Death, and Occa-\nfion thereof by Means of a Can-\ncer in her Breaft.\nIn 1622 fhe complained of a pain in her\nleft breaft, whereon there appeared at firft\na hard knob no bigger than a fmall pea\n;\nit increafed in a little time very much,\nwas very hard, and fometimes would look\nvery red; fhe took advice of furgeons,\nhad oils, fear-cloths, plates of lead, and\nwhat not: In 1623 it grew very big, and\nfpread all over her breaft ; then for many\nweeks pultices were applied to it, which\nin continuance of time broke the fkin,\nand\n\f14 Mr. Lilly's History\nand then abundance of watery tliin fluff\ncame from it, but nothing elfe ; at length\nthe matter came to fuppuration, but never\nany great ftore iffued forth it was ex-\nceeding noifome and painful; from the\nbeginning of it until fhe died, (he would\npermit no furgeon to drefs it but only\nmyfelf ; I applied every thing unto it, and\nher pains were fo great the winter before\nfhe died, that I have been called out of\nmy bed two or three times in one night\nto drefs it and change plaifters. In 1624\nby degrees with fcifiars I cut all the whole\nbreaft away, I mean the finews, nerves,\n&c. In one fortnight, or little more,\nit appeared, as it were, mere flefh, all\nraw, fo that fhe could fcarce endure any\nunguent to be applied. I remember there\nwas a great cleft through the middle of\nthe breaft, which when that fully ap-\npeared flie died, which was in September\n1624 ; my mafter being then in the coun-\ntry, his kindred in London would wil-\nlingly have had mourning for her ; but\nby advice of an efpecial friend of his I\ncontradifted them ; nor would I permit\nthem to look into any cheft or trunk in\nthe houfe : She was decently buried, and\nfo fond of me in the time of her ficknefs,\nfhe would never permit me out of her\nchamber, gave me five pounds in old\ngold, and fent me unto a private trunk of\nhers\n\fof his Life and Times. 15\nhers at a friend's houfe, where fhe had\none hundred pounds in gold ; flie bid\nme bring it away and take it, but when\nI opened the trunk I found nothing there-\nin ; for a kinfman of hers had been there\na few days before and carried all away\n:\nShe was in a great paffion at my relating\nthereof, becaufe fhe could not gratify my\npains in all her ficknefs, advifed me to\nhelp myfelf when fhe was gone, out of\nmy matter's goods, which I never did.\nCourteous Efquire, be not weary of\nreading hereof, or what followeth.\nWhen my miftrefs died, ftie had under\nher arm-hole a fmall fcarlet bag full of\nmany things, which, one that was there\ndelivered unto me. There was in this\nbag feveral figils, fome of Jupiter in Trine,\nothers of the nature of Venus, fome of\niron, and one of gold, of pure angel-\ngold, of the bignefs of a thirty three\n(hilling piece of King James's coin. In\nthe circumference on one fide was en-\ngraven, Vicit Leo de tribu \"Judce lietragram-\nmaton -}-, within the middle there was\nengraven an holy lamb. In the other\ncircumference there was Amraphel and\nthree 4-. In the middle, Sanftus Petrus,\nAlpha and Omega.\nThe occafion of framing this figil wr\nas\nthus; her former hufband travelling into\nSufTex, happened to lodge in an inn, and\nto\n\f16 Mr. Lilly's History\nto lie in a chamber thereof ; wherein, not\nmany months before a country grazier liad\nlain, and in the night cut his own throat\n;\nafter this night's lodging hewas perpetually,\nand for many years, followed by a fpirit,\nwhich vocally and articulately provoked\nhim to cut his throat ; he was ufed fre-\nquently to fay, ' I defy thee, I defy thee\/\nand to fpit at the fpirit ; this fpirit foU\nlowed him many years, he not making\nany body acquainted with it ; at laft he\ngrew melancholly and difcontented ; which\nbeing carefully obferved by his wife, fhe\nmany times hearing him pronounce, <\nI\ndefy thee\/ &c. fhe defired him to acquaint\nher with the caufe of his diftemper, which\nhe then did. Away fhe went to Dr.\nSimon Forman, who lived then in Lam-\nbeth, and acquaints him with it; who\nhaving framed this figil, and hanged it\nabout his neck, he wearing it continually\nuntil he died, was never more molefted\nby the fpirit : I fold the figil for thirty\ntwo millings, but tranfcribed the words\nverbatims I have related. Sir, you mail\nnow have a (lory of this Simon Forman,\nas his widow, whom I well knew, re-\nlated it unto me. But before I relate\nhis death, I fhall acquaint you fome-\nthing of the man, as I . have gathered\nthem from fome manufcripts of his own\nwriting.\nOf\n\fof his Life and Times.\nOf Dr. Simon Forman.\nHe was a chandler's fon in the city\nof Weftminfter* He travelled into Hol-\nland for a month in 1580, purpofely to\nbe inftrlifted in aftrology, and other more\noccult fciences % as alfo in phyfick, tak-\ning his degree of Doctor beyond feas : be-\ning fufficiently furnifhed and inftrufted\nwith what he defired, he returned into\nEngland towards the latter end of the\nreign of Queen Elizabeth, and flourifhed\nuntil that year of King James, wherein\nthe Countefs of Effex, the Earl of Somer-\nfet, and Sir Thomas Overbury's matters\nwere queftioned. He lived in Lambeth\nw7\nith a very good report of the neighbour-\nhood, efpecially of the poor, unto whom\nhe was charitable. He was a perfon that\nin horary queftions (efpecially thefts) was\nvery judicious and fortunate ; fo alfo in\nfickneffes, which indeed was his mafter-\npiece. In refolving queftions about mar-\nriage he had good fuccefs : in other quef-\ntions very moderate. He was a perfon of\nindefatigable pains. I have feen fome-\ntimes half one fheet of paper wrote of\nhis judgment upon one queftion ; in\nwriting whereof he ufed much tautology,\nas you may fee yourfelf (moft excellent\nEfquire) if you read a great book of Dr.\nC \u2022 Flood's,\n\fi8 Mr. Lilly's History\nHood's, which you have, who had all\nthat book from the manufcripts of For-\nman for I have feen the fame word for\nword in an Englifh manufcript formerly\nbelonging to Doctor Willoughby of Glou-\ncefterihire. Had Forman lived to have\nmethodized his own papers, I doubt not\nbut he would have advanced the Jatro-\nmathematical part thereof very compleatly\n;\nfor he was very obfervant, and kept notes\nof the fuccefs of his judgments, as in\nmany of his figures I have obferved. I\nvery well remember to have read in one of\nhis manufcripts, what followeth.\n' Being in bed one morning' (fays he) ' I\n' was defirous to know whether I fhould\n' ever be a Lord, Earl or Knight, &c.\n\/ whereupon I fet a figure ; and thereupon\n' my judgment \/ by which he concluded,\nthat within two years time he (hould be\na Lord or great man : f But\/ fays he, ' be-\n' fore the two years were expired, the\n\/ Doclors put me in Newgate, and no-\n.* thing came\/ Not long after, he was\ndefirous to know the fame things con-\ncerning his honour or greatfhip.

And when he came home\nhe confeffed all to be true, and that upon\nleaving his kindred he had but three pence\nin his purfe. I fhall relate one ftory\nmore, and then his death.\nOne Coleman, clerk to Sir Thomas\nBeaumont of Leicefterfhire, having had\nfome liberal favours both from his Lady\nand her daughters, bragged of it, &c.\nThe Knight brought him into the ftar-\nchamber, had his fervant fentenced to be\npilloried, whipped, and afterwards, dur-\ning life, to be imprifoned. The fentence\nwas executed in London, and was to be\nin Leicefterfhire: Two keepers were to\nconvey Coleman from the Fleet to Lei-\ncefter. My miflrefs taking coniideration\nof Coleman, and the miferies he was to\nfuffer, went prefently to Forman, ac-\nquainted him therewith ; who, after con-\nlideration, fwore Coleman had lain both\nwith mother and daughters ; and befides\nfaid, that the old Lady being afflifted\nwith fits of the mother, called him into\nher\n\fof his Life and Times. 21\nher chamber to hold down the fits with\nhis hands ; and that he holding his hands\nabout the breaft, fhe cried \u00ab Lower, lower\/\nand put his hands below her belly ; and\nthen He alfo told my miftrefs in what\npofture he lay with the young Ladies, &c.\nand (aid, * they intend in Leicefter to whip\n< him to death; but I aiTure thee, Mar-\n* gery, he fhall never come there % yet they\n* fet forward tomorrow\/ fays he ; and fo\nhis two keepers did, Coleman's legs being\nlocked with an iron chain under the horfe's\nbelly. In this nature they travelled the\nfirft and fecond day ; on the third day\nthe two keepers, feeing their prifoner's\ncivility the two preceding days, did not\nlock his chain under the horfe's belly\nas formerly, but locked it only to one *\nfide. In this pofture they rode fomc\nmiles beyond Northampton, when, on a\nfudden, one of the keepers had a necef-\nfity to untrufs, and fo the other and\nColeman ftood ftill ; by and by the other\nkeeper defired Coleman to hold his horfe,\nfor he had occafion alfo : Coleman im-\nmediately took one of their fwords, and\nran through two of the horfes, killing\nthem ftark dead; gets upon the other,\nwith one of the r fwords ;\nc\nFarewell, gen-\n* tlemen\/ quoth he, * tell my mafter I have\n* no mind to be whipped in Leicefterfhire\/\nand fo went his -way. The two keepers\nc 3 in\n\f22 Mr. Lilly's History\nin all hafte went to a gentleman's houfo\nnear at hand, complaining of their mif-\nfortune, and defired of him to purfue\ntheir prifoner, which he with much civi-\nlity granted ; but ere the horfes could be\ngot ready, the miftrefs of the houfe came\ndown, and enquiring what the matter\nwas, w^ent to the (table, and commanded\nthe horfes to be unfaddled, with this\nftiarp fpeech\n\u2014\nc\nLet the Lady Beaumont\n* and her daughters live honeftly, none of\n' my horfes fhall go forth upon this oc-\n' cafion.'\nI could relate many fuch ftories of his\nperformances ; as alfo what he wrote in\na book left behind him, viz.

Againft our corner houfe\nevery night there would come down, a-\nbout five or fix of the clock, fometime\none hundred or more boys, fome play-\ning, others as if in ferious difcourfe, and\njuft as it grew dark would all be gone\nhome j many fucceeding years there was\nno fuch, or any concourfe ufually, no\nmore than four or five in a company\n:\nIn the fpring of 1625, the boys and\nyouths of feveral parifhes in like num-\nber appeared again, which I beholding,\ncalled Thomas Sanders, my landlord, and\ntold him, that the youth and young\nboys of feveral parifhes did in that na-\nture affemble and play, in the beginning\nof the year 1625. ' God blefs us\/ quoth\nI, ' from a plague this year\/ but then\nthere fucceeded one, and the greatefl that\never was in London. In 1025, the vifi-\ntation encreafing, and my mafter having\na great charge of money and plate, fome\nof his own, fome other men's, left me\nand a fellow-fervant to keep the houfe,\nand himfelf in June went into Leicefter-\nfhire. He was in that year feoffee col-\nleftor\n\fof his Life and Times. 25\nlcflor for twelve poor alms-people living\nin Clement-Dane's Church-Yard whofe\npenfions I in his abfence paid weekly, to\nhis and parifh's great fatisfaction. My\nmatter was no fooner gone down, but I\nbought a bafs-viol, and got a mafter to\ninftruft me ; the intervals of time I fpent\nin bowling in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, with\nWat the cobler, Dick the blackfmith, and\nfuch like companions : We have fome-\ntimes been at our work at fix in the morn-\ning, and fo continued till three or four in\nthe afternoon, many times without bread\nor drink all that while. Sometimes I\nwent to church and heard funeral fer-\nmons, of which there was then great\nplenty. At other times I went early to\nSt. Antholine's in London, where there\nwas every morning a fermon. The moft\nable people of the whole city and fuburbs\nwere out of town; if any remained, it\nwere fuch as were engaged by parifh-\noffices to remain ; no habit of a gentle^\nman or woman continued ; the woeful\ncalamity of that year was grievous, peo-\nple dying in the open fields and in the\nopen ftreets. At laft, in Auguft, the\nbills of mortality fo encreafed, that very\nfew people had thoughts of furviving the\ncontagion : The Sunday before the great\nbill came forth, which was of five thoufand\nand odd hundreds, there was appointed\na facra-\n\f26 Mr. Lilly's History\na facramest at Clement Dane's ; during\nthe diftributing whereof I do very well\nremember we fang thirteen parts of the\none hundred and nineteeth Pfalm. One\nJacob, our minifter (for we had three that\nday, the communion was fo great) fell\nfick as he was giving the facrament, went\nhome, and was buried of the plague the\nThurfday following. Mr. James, ano-\nther of the minifters, fell fick ere he had\nquite finifhed, had the plague, and was\nthirteen weeks ere he recovered. Mr.\nWhitacre, the laft of the three, efcaped\nnot only then, but all the contagion fol-\nlowing, without any ficknefs at all;\nthough he officiated at every funeral, and\nburied all manner of people, whether\nthey died of the plague or not. He was\ngiven to drink, feldom could preach more\nthan one quarter of an hour at a time,\n&c. In November my matter came home.\nMy fellow-fervant's and my diet came\nweekly to fix (hillings and fix pence,\nfometimes to feven {hillings, fo cheap was\ndiet at that time.\nIn February of that year, my matter\nmarried again (one who after his death\nbecame my wife). In the fame year he\nfettled upon me, during my life, twenty\npounds per annum> which I have enjoyed\never fince, even to the writing hereof.\nMay\n\fof his Life and Times. 27\nMay 22, 1627, my mafter died at the\ncorner houfe in the Strand, where I alfo\nlived fo long. He died inteftate ; my\nmiftrefs relinquifliing the adminiftration,\nit came to his elder brother, who affigned\nthe eftate over to me for payment of my\nmatter's debts ; which being paid, I faith-\nfully returned the remaining part unto\nhis adminiftrator ; nor had one penny of\nthe eftate more than twenty pounds per\nannum, which was allowed me by con-\ntract, to undertake the payment of my\nmatter's debts,\nOf my Marriage the firft Time.\nMy miftrefs had been twice married\nto old men, was now refolved to be cou-\n?ened no more; fhe was of a brown\nruddy complexion, corpulent, of but\nmean ftature, plain, no education, yet a\nvery provident perfon, and of good con-\ndition : She had many fuitors, old men,\nwhom ftie declined ; fome gentlemen of\ndecayed fortunes^ whom fhe liked not,\nfor fhe was covetous and fparing ;\nBy my\nfellow-fervant fhe was obferved frequently\nto fay, fhe cared not if fhe married a\nman that would love her, fo that he had\nnever a penny ; and would ordinarily talk\nof me when ftie was in bed : This fer-\nyant\n\f2S Mr. Lilly's History\nvant gave me encouragement to give the\nonfet : I was much perplexed hereat, for\nfhould I attempt her, and be flighted, fhe\nwould never care for me afterwards ; but\nagain, I considered that if I fhould at-\ntempt and fail, fhe would never fpeak\nof it; or would any believe I durft be fo\naudacious as to propound fuch a quef-\ntion, the difproportion of years and for-\ntune being fo great betwixt us : However,\nall her talk was of hufbands, and in my\nprefence faying one day after dinner, fhe\nrefpecled not wealth, but defired an ho-\nneft man ; I made anfwer, I thought I\ncould fit her with fuch a hufband ; fhe\nallied me, where ? I made no more ado,\nbut prefently faluted her, and told her\nmyfelf was the man : She replied, I was\ntoo young; I faid nay; what I had not\nin wealth, I would fupply in love ; and\nfaluted her frequently, which (he ac-\ncepted lovingly ; and next day at dinner\nmade me fit down at dinner with my\nhat on my head, and faid, fhe intended\nto make me her hufband ; for which I\ngave her many falutes, &c.\nI was very careful to keep all things\nfecret, for I well knew, if fhe fhould take\ncounfel of any friend, my hopes would be\nfruftrated, therefore I fuddenly procured\nher confent to marry, unto which fhe\naffented ; fo that upon the eighth dav\nof\ni\n\fof his Life and Times. 29\nof September 1627, at St. George's church'\nin Southwark, I was married unto her,\nand for two whole years we kept it\nfecret. When it was divulged, and loose\npeople blamed her for it, (he conftantly\nreplied, that (lie had no kindred; if I\nproved kind, and a good huiband, flic\nwould make me a man ; if I proved\notherwife, fhe only undid herfetf. In\nthe third and fourth years after our mar-\nriage, we had ftrong fuits of law with\nher firft hufband's kindred, but over-\nthrew them in the end. During all the\ntime of her life, which was until Oftober\n1633, we lived very lovingly, I frequent-\ning no company at all ; my exercifes were\nfometimes angling, in which I ever de-\nlighted : My companions, two aged men.\nI then frequented lectures, two or three\nin a week ; I heard Mr. Sute in Lombard-\nStreet, Mr. Gouge of Elack-Fryars, Dr.\nMicklethwait of the Temple, Dr. Oldf-\nworth, with others, the moft learned men\nof thefe times, and leaned in judgment to\nPuritanifm. In October 1627, 1 was made\nfree of the Salters company in London.\nHow I came to ftudjr Aftrology.\nIt happened on one Sunday 1632, as\nxnyfelf and a Juftice of Peace's clerk were,\nbefore\n\f30 Mr. Lilly's History\nbefore fervice, difcourfing of many things,\nhe chanced to fay, that fuch a perfon was\na great fcholar, nay, fo learned, that he\ncould make an Almanack, which to me\nthen was ftrange : One fpeech begot ano-\nther, till, at laft, he faid, he could bring\nme acquainted with one Evans in Gun-\nPowder -Alley, who had formerly lived in\nStaffordfhire, that was an excellent wife\nman, and ftudied the Black Art. The\nfame week after we went to fee Mr. Evans.\nWhen we came to his houfe, he having\nbeen drunk the night before, was upon\nhis bed, if it be lawful to call that a bed\nwhereon he then lay ; he roufed up him-\nfelf, and, after fome compliments, he was\ncontent to inftruft me in aftrology ; I\nattended his beft opportunities for feven\nor eight weeks, in which time I could\nfet a figure perfectly : Books he had not\nany, except Haly de judiciis Aftrorum,\nand Orriganus's Ephemerides ; fo that\nas often as I entered his houfe, I thought\nI was in the Wildernefs. Nowfomething\nof the man : He was by birth a Welfh-\nman, a Mafter of Arts, and in facred\norders; he had formerly had a cure of\nfouls in Staffordfhire, but now was come\nto try his fortunes at London, being in a\nmanner enforced to fly for fome offences\nvery fcandalous committed by him in\nthefe parts, where hu had lately lived.;\n\fof his Life and Times. 31\nfor he gave judgment upon things loft,\nthe only fhame of aftrology : He was the\nmoft faturnine perfon my eyes ever be-\nheld, either before I pra&ifed or fmce\n;\nof a middle ftature, broad forehead, beetle-\nbrowed, thick fhoulders, flat nofed, full\nlips, down-looked, black curling ftiff\nhair, fplay-footed ; to give him his right,\nhe had the moft piercing judgment na-\nturally upon a figure of theft, and many\nother queftions, that I ever met withal\n;\nyet for money he would willingly give\ncontrary judgments, was much addifted\nto debauchery, and then very abufive and\nquarrelfome, feldom without a black eye,\nor one mifchief or other : This is the\nfame Evans who made fo many antimo-\nnial cups, upon the fale whereof he prin-\ncipally fubfifted ; he underftood Latin very\nwell, the Greek tongue not at all: He\nhad fome arts above, and beyond aftro-\nlogy, for he was well verfed in the na-\nture of fpirits, and had many times ufed\nthe circular way of invocating, as in the\ntime of our familiarity he told me. Two\nof his aftions I will relate, as to me de-\nlivered. There was in StafFordlhire a\nyoung gentlewoman that had, for her\npreferment, married an aged rich perfon,\nwho being defirous to purchafe fome\nlands for his wife's maintenance ; but\nthis young gentlewoman, his wife, was\ndefired\n\f32 Mr. Lilly's History\ndefired to buy the land in the name of a\ngentleman, her very dear friend, but\nfor her ufe : After the aged man was\n\u2022dead, the widow could by no means pro-\ncure the deed of purchafe from her friend;\nwhereupon {he applies herfelf to Evans,\nwho, for a fum of money, promifes to\nhave her deed fafely delivered into her\nown hands ; the fum was forty pounds.\nEvans applies himfelf to the invocation\nof the angel Salmon, of the nature of\nMars, reads his Litany in the Common-\nPrayer-Book every day, at feleft hours,\nwears his furplice, lives orderly all that\ntime ; at the fortnight's end Salmon ap-\npeared, and having received his com-\nmands what to do, in a fmall time re-\nturns with the very deed defired, lays it\ndown gently upon a table where a white\ncloth was fpread, and then, being dif-\nmiffed, vanifhcd. The deed was, by the\ngentleman who formerly kept it, placed\namong many other of his evidences in a\nlarge wooden cheft, and in a chamber at\none end of the houfe ; but upon Salmon's\nremoving and bringing away the deed, all\nthat bay of building was quite blown down,\nand all his own proper evidences torn all to\npieces. The fecond ftory folioweth.\nSome time before I became acquainted\nwith him, he then living in the Mino-\nries, was defired by the Lord Bothwell\nand\n\fof his Life and Times. 33\nand Sir Kenelm Digby to fhow them a\nfpirit. He promifed fo to do : the time\ncame, and they were all in the body of\nthe circle, when lo, upon a fudden, after\nfome time of invocation, Evans was taken\nfrom out the room, and carried into the\nfield near Batterfea Caufeway, clofe to the\nThames. Next morning a countryman\ngoing by to his labour, and efpying a man\nin black cloaths, came unto him and\nawaked him, and afked him how he came\nthere ? Evans by this underftood his con-\ndition, enquired where he was, how far\nfrom London, and in what parifh he was\n;\nwhich when he underftood, he told the\nlabourer he had been late at Batterfea the\nnight before, and by chance was left there\nby his friends. Sir Kenelm Digby and\nthe Lord Bothwell went home without\nany harm, came next day to hear what\nwas become v * him; juft as they in the\nafternoon came into the houfe, a meffen-\nger came from Evans to his wife, to come\nto him at Batterfea. I enquired upon\nwhat account the fpirit carried him away\n:\nwho faid, he had not, at the time of in\nvocation, made any fuffumigation, at\nwhich the fpirits were vexed. It hap-\npened, that after I difcerned what aftro-\nlogy was, I went weekly into Little-\nBritain, and bought many books of aftro-\nlogy, not acquainting Evans therewith.\nD Mr.\n\f34 Mr. Lilly's History\nMr. A. Eedwell, Minifter of Tottenham^\nHigh-Crofs near London, who had been\nmany years chaplain to Sir Henry Wot-\nton, whilft he was Ambafiador at Venke>\nand aflifced Pietro Soave Polano, in com-\npering and writing the Council of Trent,\nwas lately dead ; and his library being\nfold into Little- Britain, I bought a-\nmongft them my choicefi books of aftro-\nlogy. The occafion of our falling out\nwas thus : a woman demanded the re-\nfolution of a queftion, which when he\nhad done, Are went her way ; I {landing\nby all the while, and observing the figure,\nafked him why he gave the judgment he\ndid, fince the figmfication fhewed quite the\ncontrary, and gave him my reafons ; which\nwhen he had pondered, he called me boy,\n\u2022and muft he be contradicted by fueh a\nnovice ? But when his heat was aver, he\nlaid, had he not fo judged to pleafe the\nwoman, fixe would have given him nor-\nthing, and he had a wife and family to\nprovide for ; upon this we never came\ntogether after. Being now very meanly\nintroduced, I applied myfelf to ltudy thofe\nbooks I had obtained, many times twelve,\nor fifteen, or eighteen hours day and\nnight ; I was curious to difcover, whe-\nther there was any verity in the art or\nnot. Aftrology in this time, viz. in 1633,\nwas very rare in London, few profeffing.\n\fof his Life and Times. 35\nit that underftood any thing thereof.\nLet it not repent you (O noble Efquire)\nif now I make a fliort digreffion of fuch\nperfons as then profefled aftrology, that\npofterity may underftand in what condi-\ntion I found it, and in whofe hands that\nlittle that remained was lodged.\nThere lived then in Houndfditch one\nAlexander Hart, who had been a foldier\nformerly, a comely old man, of good\nafpeft ; he profefled queftionary aftrology,\nand a little of phyfick; his greateft fkill\nwas to eledt young gentlemen fit times to\nplay at dice, that they might win or get\nmoney. I went unto him for refolutions\nfor three queftions at feveral times, and\nhe erred in every one. To fpeak foberly\nof him, he was but a cheat, as appeared\nfuddenly after; for a ruftical fellow of\nthe city, defirous of knowledge, con-\ntracted with Hart to affift for a confe-\nrence with a fpirit, and paid him twenty\npounds of thirty pounds the contraft.\nAt laft, after many delays, and no fpirit\nappearing, or money returned, the young\nman indi\u00a3ls him for a cheat at the Old-\nBailey in London; the Jury found the\nbill, and at the hearing of the caufe this\njell happened : fome of the bench enquired\nwhat Hart did ? * He fat like an Alderman\n* in his gown\/ quoth the fellow 5 at which\nD 2 the\n\f36 Mr. Lilly's History\nthe court fell into a great laughter, moft\nof the court being Aldermen. He was\nto have been fet upon the pillory for this\ncheat ; but John Taylour, the Water Poet,\nbeing his great friend, got the Lord Chief\nJuftice Richardfon to bail him, ere he\nflood upon the pillory, and fo Hart fled\nprefently into Holland, where he ended\nhis days. It was my fortune, upon the\nfale of his books in 1634, to buy ArgolFs\nPrimum Mobile for fourteen {hillings,\nwhich I only wanted.\nIn Lambeth Marfh at the fame time\nlived one Captain Bubb, who refolved\nhorary queftions aftrologically ; a proper\nhandfome man, well fpoken, but withal\ncovetous, and of no honefty, as will ap-\npear by this ftory, for which he flood\nupon the pillory. A certain butcher was\nrobbed, going to a fair, of forty pounds\n;\nhe goes to Bubb, who for ten pounds\nin hand paid, would help him to the\n*hief ; appoints the butcher fuch a night\nprecifely, to watch at fuch a place, and\nthe thief fhould come thither -> command-\ned him by any means to flop him ; the\nbutcher attends according to dire<5tion.\nAbout twelve in the night there comes\none riding very fiercely upon a full gal-\nlop, whom the butcher knocks down,\nand feized both upon man and horfe\n:\nThe\n\fof his Life and Times. 37\nThe butcher brings the man and horfe\nto the next town, but then the perfon\nwhom the butcher attacked was John,\nthe fervant of Dr. Bubb ; for which the\nCaptain was indifted and fuffered upon\nthe pillory, and afterwards ended his\ndays in great difgrace.\nThere was alfo one Jeffry Neve, at\nthis time a ftudent in phyfick and aftro-\nlogy ; he had formerly been a merchant in\nYarmouth, and Mayor of the town, but\nfailing in eftate, went into the Low-\nCountries, and at Franecker took the\ndegree of Doctor in Phyfick ; he had\nfome little fmattering in aftrology ; could\nrefolve a queftion of theft, or love-quef-\ntion, fomething of ficknefs ; a very grave\nperfon, laborious and honeft, of tall fea-\nture and comely feature ; he died of late\nyears, almoft in the very ftreet near Tower-\nHill : He had a defign of printing two\nhundred verified queftions, and defired my\napprobation ere they went to the prefs ;\nthat I firft would fee them, and then\ngive teftirriony. When I had perufed\nthe firft forty, I corrected thirty of\nthem, would read over no more : I\nihev\/ed him how erroneous they were,\ndefired his emendation of the reft, which\nhe performed not. Thefe were after-\nwards, in R. Saunders's cuftody, bought\nD 3 by\n\f38 Mr. Lilly's History\nby him either of his fon or of a ftati-\noner: (a)\nThere was then William Poole, g.\nnibler at aftrology, fometimes a gardener,\nan apparitor, a drawer of linen ; as quoifs,\nhandkerchiefs; a plaifterer and a brick-\nlayer ; he would brag many times he had\nbeen of feventeen profeffions ; was very\ngood company for drolling, as you your-\nlelf very well remember (moft honoured\nSir) ; (b) he pretended to poetry and\nthat pofterity may have a tafte of it, you\n(hall here have inferted two verfes of his\nown making; the occafion of making\nthem was thus. One Sir Thomas Jay,\na Juftice of the Peace in Rofemary-Lane,\niflued out his warrant for the apprehen-\nfion of Poole, upon a pretended fuggef-\ntion, that he was in company with fome\nlewd people in a Tavern, where a filver\ncup was loft, Anglice ftolen.

He left behind him two fons\nand two daughters.

He was a perfon very ftudious,\nlaborious, of good apprehenfion, and had\nby his own induftry obtained both in\naftrology, phyfick, arithmetick, aftro-\nnomy, geometry and algebra, lingular\njudgment : He would in aftrology refolve\nhorary queftions very foundly ; but was\never diffident of his own abilities : He\nwas exquifitely fkilful in the art of direc-\ntions upon nativities, and had a good\ngenius in performing judgment thereupon,\nfiut very unhappy he was, that he had\n(b) There is no fuch place in Suffolk, it being\nfnifhfcen for Framlingham in that county,\nno\n\f44 Mr. Lilly's History\nno genius in teaching his fcholars, for\nhe never perfefted any: his own fon\nMatthew hath often told me, that where\nhis father did teach any fcholars in his\ntime, they would principally learn of him\n;\nhe had Scorpio afcending, and was fe-\ncretly envious to thofe he thought had\nmore parts than himfelf; however, I\nmuft be ingenuous, and do affirm, that\nby frequent converfation with him, I\ncame to know which were the beft au-\nthors, and much to enlarge my judg-\nment, efpecially in the art of dire&ions\n:\nHe vifited me moft days once after I\nbecame acquainted with him, and would\ncommunicate his moft doubtful queftions\nunto me, and accept of my judgment\ntherein rather than his own : He lingu-\nlarly well judged and dire\u00a3ted Sir Robert\nHolborn's nativity, but defired me to\nadjudge the firft houfe, feventh and tenth\nthereof, which I did, and which nativity\n(fince Sir Robert gave it me) came to\nyour hands, and remains in your library\n[oh learned Efquire] he died about the\nfeventy-eighth year of his age, poor.\nIn this year alfo William Bredon, par-\nfon or vicar of Thornton in Buckingham-\nshire, was living, a profound divine, but\nabfolutely the moft polite perfon for na-\ntivities in that age, ftriftly adhering tQ\nPtolomy, which he well underftood; he\n\fof his Life and Times. 45\nhad a hand in compofing Sir Chriftopher\nHeydon's defence of judicial aftrology,\nbeing that time his chaplain; he was lo\ngiven over to tobacco and drink, that\nwhen he Jiad no tobacco, he would cut\nthe bell-ropes and fmoke them.\nI come now to continue the ftory of\nmy own life, but thought it not incon-\nvenient to commit unto memory fome-\nthing concerning thofe perfons who prac-\ntifed when firfl- I became a ftudent in\naftrology ; I have wrote nothing concern-\ning any of them, which I myfelf do not\ncither know, or believe to be true.\nIn Oftober 1633 my firfl: wife died,\nand left me whatever was hers : it was\nconfiderable, very near to the value of\none thoufand pounds.\nOne whole year and more I continued\na widower, and followed my ftudies very\nhard ; during which time a fcholar pawn-\ned unto me, for forty fhillings, Ars\nNotoria, (a) a large volume wrote in\nparchment, with the names of thofe an-\ngels, and their piftures, which are thought\nand believed by wife men, to teach and\ninftruft in all the feveral liberal fciences,\nand is attained by obferving elefted times>\n(a) Among Dr. Napier's MSS.

Her defire\nunto me was to allift her to fee him,\nand then fhe fhould be content; where-\nupon I ordered fuch a day, fuch an hour\nof that day, to try her fortune once more.\nShe obeyed; and when {he came to the\nKing's Bench, where the Lord there was\nimprifoned, the outward door flood wide\nopen : none fpeaking a word unto her,\nfhe went up flairs, no body molefting her ;\nfhe found the Lord's chamber door wide\nopen: he in bed, not a fervant to be heard\nor feen, fo fhe was pleafed.

I\ntold him I was willing to teach, but\nwould have one hundred pounds. I heard\nPoole, whilft I was judging the figure,\nwhifper in Humphreys's ear, and. fwear\nI was the beft in England. Staying three\nor four days in town, at laft we con-\ntracted for forty pounds, for I could\nnever be quiet from his folicitations ; he\ninvited me to fupper, and before I had\nfhewed him any thing, paid me thirty five\npounds. As we were at fupper a client\ncame to fpeak with him, and fo up into\nhis clofet he went with his client ; I called\nhim in before he fet his figure, or refolved\nE 2 1 the\n\f52 Mr. Lilly's History\nthe queftion, and inftantly acquainted\nhim how he fhould difcover the moles or\nmarks of his client ; he fet his figure, and\nprefently difcovers four moles the que-\nrent had ; and was fo overjoyed there-\nwith, that he came tumbling down the\nftairs, crying, 6\nFour by G\u2014, four by\n' G\u2014, I will not take one hundred pounds\n* for this one rule:' In fix weeks time,\nand tarrying with him three days in a\nweek, he became a moft judicious perfon.\nThis Humphreys was a laborious per-\nfon, vain-glorious, loquacious, fool-hardy,\ndefirous of all fecrets v. hich he knew not,\ninfomueh that he would have given me\ntwo hundred pounds to have inftrufted\nKm in fome curiofities he was perfuaded\nI had knowledge of, but, Artis ejl celere\n6>rtcw> eipecially to thofe who live not in\nthe fear of God, or can be mafters of\ntheir own counfels : He was in perfon\nand condition fu.ch another as that mon-\nfter of ingratitude my quondam taylor*\nJohn Gadbury.. After my refufal of\nteaching him, what he was not capable\nof, we grew (trange, though I afforded\nhim many \"civilities whenever he required\nit ; for after the fiege of Colchefter he\nwrote a book againft me, called Anti\nIVlcrlinus-Anglicus, married a fecond wife,\nhis firft living . in Cambridgeihire, then\npraftiLed phyiick by a contrary name,\n: L - .\n* having\n\fof his Life and Times. 5^\nhaving intentions to pra\u00a3tife in Ireland-\nhe went to Briftol, but there underftand\n;\ning the parliament's forces had reduced\nthat kingdom, he came back to London,\nbut durft not abide therein but running\nfrom his fecond wife, who alfo had ano-\nther hufband, he went to fea, with in-\ntention for Barbadoes, but died by the\nway in his voyage. I had never feen\nJohn Booker at that time ; but telling\nhim one day I had a defire to fee him,\nbut firft, ere I would fpeak with him, I\nwould fit myfelf with my old rules, and\nrub up my aftrology; for at that time\n[and this was 1640] I thought John\nBooker the greateft andmoft compleataftro-\nloger in the world. My fcholar Hum-\nphreys prefently made anfwer, < Tutor, you\n4\nneed not pump for any of your former\n* knowledge, John Booker is no fuch\n* pumper ; we met\/ faith he, f the other\n* day, and I was too hard for him myfelf,\nf upon judgment of three or four quef-\n< tions.' If all the tranfaftions happen-\ning unto that my fcholar were in one\nvolume, they would tranfcend either Guz-\nman, Don Quixote, Lazarillo de Tor-\nmes, or any other of the like nature I\never did fee.\nHaving now in part recovered my\nhealth, being weary of the country, and\nperceiving there was money to be got in\nE 3 London,\n\f54 Mr. Lilly's History\nLondon, and thinking myfelf to be as\nfufficiently enabled in aftrology as any\nI could meet with, I made it my bufi-\nnefs to repair thither ; and lb in Septem-\nber 1 641 I did; where, in the years\n1642 and 1643, I had great leifure to\nbetter my former knowledge : I then\nread over all my books of aftrology, over\nand over ; had very little or no practice\nat all : And whereas formerly I could\nnever endure to read Valentine Naibod's\nCommentary upon Alcabitius, now hav-\ning ferioufly ftudied him, I found him\nto be the profoundeft author I ever met\nwith ; him I traverfed over day and night,\nfrom whom I muft acknowledge to have\nadvanced my judgment and knowledge\nunto that height I foon after arrived at,\nor unto: A moft rational author, and\nthe fharpeft expofitor of Ptolomy that\nhath yet appeared. To exercife my ge-\nnius, I began to collect notes, and\nthought of writing fome little thing\nupon the 6 of T? and v then approach-\ning : I had not wrote above one fheet,\nand that very meanly, but James Lord\nGalloway came to fee me 3 and, by chance,\ncafting his eyes upon that rude collec-\ntion, he read it over, and fo approved\nof it, yea, fo encouraged me to proceed\nfarther, that then, and after that time,\nI fpent moft of my time in compofing\nthereof\n\fof his Life and Times. 55\nthereof, and bringing it, in the end, into\nthat method wherein it was printed 1\n044.\nI do ferioufly now profefs, I had not the\nafliftance of any perfon living, in the\nwriting or compofing thereof. Mr. Fifke\nfent me a fmall manufcript which had\nbeen Sir Chriftopher Heydon's, who\nhad wrote fomething of the conjuftion\nof T? and 1603 ; out of which, to\nbring my method in order, I tranferibed,\nin the beginning, five or fix lines, and\nnot any more, though that gracelefs fel-\nlow Gadbury wrote the contrary ; but,\nSeme\/ & femper nebula & mendax. I did\nformerly write one treatife, in the year\n1639, upon the eclipfe of the fun, in the\nnth degree of Gemini, 22 May 1639:\nIt confifted of fix fheets of paper. But\nthat manufcript I gave unto my moft\nmunificent patron, and ever bountiful\nfriend William Pennington, of Mun-\ncafter in Cumberland, Efq; a wife and\nexcellently learned perfon * who, from\nthe year 1634, even till he died, conti-\nnued unto me the moft grateful perfon I\never was acquainted with. I became\nacquainted with him by means of Davy\nRamfey.\nOh ! njoft noble Efquire, let me now\nbeg your pardon, if I digrefs for fome\nfmall time, in commemorating his boun-\nty unto me, and my requital of his\nE 4 friendfhip,\n\f56 Mr. Lilly's History\nfriendfhip, by performing many things\nfuccefsfully for his advantage.\nIn 1639 he was made captain, and\nferved His Majefly in his then wars a-\ngainft the Scots ; during which time a\nfarmer's daughter being delivered of a\nbaftard, and hearing, by report, that he\nwas flain, fathered the child upon him.\nShortly after he returned, moft woefully\nvexed to be thus abufed, when abfent.\nThe woman was countenanced by fome\ngentlemen of Cumberland, in this her\nvillany againft him ; fo that, notwith-\nftanding he had warrants to attach her\nbody, he could never difcover her : But\nyet, hunting her from one place to ano-\nther, her friends thought it moft con-\nvenient to fend her to London, where\n{he might be in moft fafety. She came\nup to the city, and immediately I had\nnotice thereof, and the care of that mat-\nter left unto me. I procured the Lord\nChief Juftice Bramfton's warrant, and\nhad it lying dormant by me. She had\nnot been in the city above one fortnight,\nbut that I, going cafually to the clerk of\nthe affizes office for Cumberland, faw\nthere an handfome woman ; and hearing\nof her fpeak the northern tone, I conr-\neluded the was the party I did fo want.\nI rounded the clerk in his ear, and told\nhim I would give him five fhillings to\n\fof his Life and Times. 57\nhold the woman in chat till I came\nagain, for I had a writing concerned\nher. I hafted for my warrant, and a\nconftable, and returned into the office,\nfeized her perfon before the clerk of the\naflizes, who was very angry with me :\nIt was then feffions at Old-Bayley, and\nneither Judge nor Juftice to be found.\nAt night we carried her before the Re-\ncorder, Gardner. It being Saturday at\nnight, fhe, having no bail, was fent to\nBridewell, where fhe remained till Mon-\nday. On Monday morning, at the Old-\nBayley, fhe produced bail ; but I defiring\nof the Recorder fome time to enquire\nafter the bail, whether they were fuffi-\ncient, returned prefently, and told him\none of the bail was a prifoner in Lud-\ngate, the other a very poor man : At\nwhich he was fo vexed, that he fent her\nto Newgate, where fhe lay all that week,\nuntil fhe could pleafe me with good fure-\nties ; which then fhe did, and fo was\nbound over to appear at the next aflizes\nin Cumberland ; which fhe did, and was\nthere fentenced to be whipped, and im-\nprifoned one whole year.\nThis aftion infinitely pleafed Mr. Pen-\nnington, who thought I could do won-\nders y and I was moft thankfully requited\nfor it. All the while of this fcandalous\nfcufmefs, do what he could, he could not\ndifcover\n\f58 Mr. Lilly's History\ndifcover what perfons they were that fup-\nported her ; but the woman's father com-\ning to town, I became acquainted with\nhim, by the name of Mr. Sute, mer-\nchant; invited him to a dinner; got\nGeorge Farmer with me; when we fo\nplied him with wine, he could neither\nfee or feel. I paid the reckoning, being\ntwenty two (hillings. But next morning\nthe poor man had never a writing or\nletter in his pocket. I fent them down\nto my friend, who thereby difcovered the\nplots of feveral gentlemen in the bufinefs ;\nafter which, Mr. Sute returned tp his\npld name again.\nMr. Pennington was a true royalift,\nwhom Charles the Second made one of\nhis Commiffioners of Array for Cumber-\nland. Having directions from me con-\ntinually how matters did and would go\nbetwixt the King 'and Parliament, he\nafted v^arily, and did but fign one only\nwarrant, of that nature, and then gave\nover. When the times of fequeftrations\ncame, one John Mufgrave, the moft bold\nand impudent fellow, and moft aftive of\nall the north of England, and moft mali-\ncious againft my friend, had got this\nwarrant under Mr. Pennington's hand\ninto his cuftody ; which affrighted my\nfriend, and fo it might, for it was caufe\nenough of fequeftratiqn, ai;d would have\ndone\n\fof his Life and Times. 59\ndone it.

We did\nmeet, and he very fuddenly produced upon\nthe table all his papers, and withal, the\nwarrant of array unto which my friend\nhad fet his hand ; which when I faw, c\nI\nmarry\/ faid I, ' this is his hand I will\nf fwear \\ now have at all ; come, the other\nf cup, this warrant fhall pay for all\/ I\npbferved where the warrant lay upon the\ntable, and, after fome time took occafion\nignorantly to let the candle fall out, which\nwhilft he went to light again at the\nfire, I made fure of the warrant, and\nput it into my boot ; he never miffing it\nof eight or ten days ; about which time,\nI believe, it was above half way towards\nCumberland, for I inftantly fent it by the\npoft, with this friendly caveat, * Sin no\nf more\/ Mufgrave durft not challenge\nme in thofe times, and fo the bufinefs\nwas ended very fatisfaftory to his friend,\nand no lefs to myfelf.\nHe\n\f66 Mr. Lilly's History\nHe was, befides, extreamly abufed by\none Ifaac Antrobus, parfon of Egremond,\na moft evil liver, bold, and very rich ; at\nlaft he procured a minifter of that coun-\ntry, in hope of the parfonage, to article\nagainft him in London, before the com-\nmittee of plundered minifters. I was\nonce more invited to follicit againft An-\ntrobus, which I did upon three or more\narticles.\nI. That Antrobus baptized a cock, and\ncalled him Peter.\nII. He had knowledge of fuch a wo-\nman and of her daughter, viz. of both\ntheir bodies, in as large a manner as ever\nof his own wife.\nIII.

So he was ad-\njudged fcandalous, and outed of his be-\nnefice, and our minifter had the parfo-\nnage.\nYou cannot imagine how much the\nrouting of this drunken parfon pleafed\nMr. Pennington, who paid all charges\nmunificently and thankfully.\nBut now follows the laft and greateft\nkindnefs I ever did him. Notwithftanding\nthe committee for fequeftrations in Cum-\nberland were his very good friends, yet\nthe fub-fequeftrators, of their own heads,\n\f62 Mr. Lilly's History\nand without order, and by ftrength of\narms, fecured his iron, his wood, and\nfo much of his perfonal eftate as was\nvalued at feven thoufand pounds. Now\nhad I complaint upon complaint : would\nI fuffer my old friend to be thus abufed ?\nit was in my power to free him from thefe\nvillains.\nI hereupon advifed what was beft to\ndo, and was counfelled to get Mr. Speaker\nLenthall's letter to the fub-fequeftrators,\nand command them to be obedient to the\ncommittee of the county.\nWhereupon, I framed a letter myfelf,\nunto the fub-fequeftrators direfted, and\nwith it, myfelf and Mr. Laurence Mayd-\nwell (whom yourfelf well knew) went\nto Mr. Speaker, unto whom we fuffi-\nciently related the ftubbornnefs of the\nofficers of Cumberland ; their difobedience\nto the committee ; and then fhewed him\nthe letter, which when he had read\nover, he moft courteoufly figned, adding\nwithal, that if they proceeded further in\nfequeftring Mr. Pennington, he would\ncommand a Serjeant at Arms to bring\nthem up to anfwer their contempts : I\nimmediately pofted that letter to my\nfriend, which when the abfurd fellows\nreceived, they delivered him poffeflion of\nhis goods again; and, for my pains,\nwhen he came to London, gave me one\nhundred\n\fof his Life and Times. $J\nIxundred pounds: He died in 1652, of a\nviolent fever. I did carefully, in 164a\nand 1643, take notice of every grand\na\u00a3tion which happened betwixt King and\nParliament, and did firft then incline to\nbelieve, that as all fublunary affairs did\ndepend upon fuperior caufes, fo there\nwas a poffibility of difcovering them by\nthe configurations of the fuperior bodies ;\nin which way making fome effays in thofe\ntwo years, I found encouragement to\nproceed further, which I did ; I perufed\nthe writings of the ancients, but therein\nthey were filent, or gave no fatisfaftion\n;\nat laft, I framed unto myfelf that me-\nthod, which then and fince I follow,\nwhich, I hope, in time may be more per-\nfected by a more penetrating perfon than\nmyfelf.\nIn 1643, I became familiarly known to\nSir Bulftrode Whitlocke, a member of the\nHoufe of Commons ; he being fick, his\nurine was brought unto me by Mrs.\nLifle, (a) wife to John Lifle, afterwards\noiie of the keepers of the Great Seal j\n(a) She was afterwards beheaded at Winchefter,\nfor harbouring one Nelthrop, a rebel in the Duke of\nMonmouth's army 1685.

In my Epiftle of the Starry Mef-\nfenger, I had been a little too plain with\nthe Committee of Leicefterfhire ; who\nthereof made complaint unto Sir Arthur\nHazelrigg, Knight for that county ; he\nwas a furious perfon, and made a motion\nin the Houfe of Commons againft me,\nand the bulinefs was committed to that\nCommittee, whereof Baron Rigby was\nChairman. A day was affigned to hear\nthe matter ; in the morning whereof, as\nI paffed by Mr. Pullen's fhop in St. Paul's\nChurch-yard, Pullen bad God be with\nyou, and named me by name. Mr. Sei-\ndell being there, and hearing my name,\ngave direction to call me unto him,\nwhere he acquaints me with Hazelrigg's\nhumour and malice towards me, called\nfor the Starry Meflenger, and having\nF 4 read\n\f72 Mr. Lilly's History\nread over the words mentioning that\nCommittee, he afked me how I would\nanfwer them ? I related what I would\nhave faid, but he contradifted me, and\nacquainted me what to fay, and how\nto anfwer. In the afternoon I went to\nappear, but there was no Committee\nfet, or would fit ; for both Mr. Rey-\nnolds and Sir Philip Stapleton, and my\nother friends, had fully acquainted Baron\nRigby with the bufinefs, and defired not\nto call upon me until they appeared\n;\nfor the matter and charge intended againft\nme was very frivolous, and only prefented\nby a cholerick perfon to pleafe a com-\npany of clowns, meaning the Committee\nof Leicefter.

He was a great\nroyalift, but could never hit any thing\nright for that party, though he much\ndefired it : He refolved queftions aftro-\nlogically ; nativities he meddled not with\n;\nin things of other nature, which required\nmore curiofity, he repaired to the cryf-\ntal: His angels were Raphael, Gabriel,\nand Uriel : his life anfwered not in ho-\nlinefs and fan&ity to what it ftiould,\nhaving to deal with thofe holy angels*.\nBeing contemporary with me, I fhail re-\nlate what my partner John Scott, the\nfame Scott as is before-mentioned, af-\nfirmed of him. John Scott was a little\nfldlful in furgery and phyfick, fo was\nWill Hocjges, and had formerly been a\nfchool-mafter. Scott having fome occa-\nfions into SUfFordfhire, addrefled himfelf\nfor a month or fix weeks to Hodges,\naffifted him to drefs his patients, let\nblood, &c. Being to return to London,\nhe defired Hodges to fhew him the per-\nfon and feature of the woman he fhould\nmarry. Hodges carries him into a field\nnot far from his houfe, pulls out his\ncryftal, bids Scott fet his foot to his,\nand, after a while, wifhes him to infpett\nthe cryftal, and obferve what he faw\nthere. 1\nI fee\/ faith Scott, * a ruddy com-\n< pjexioned wench in a red waiftcoat,\n' drawing\n\f74 Mr. Lilly's History\n4\ndrawing a can of beer\/ * She muft be\n* your wife, ' faid Hodges. * You are\nc\nmiftaken, Sir, '\nfaid Scott. 4\nI am, fo\n' foon as I come to London, to marry a\n* tall gentlewoman in the Old-Bailey\/\n' You muft marry the red waiftcoat,' faid\nHodges. Scott leaves the country, comes\nnp to London, finds his gentlewoman\nmarried : Two years after going into\nDover, in his return, he refrefhed him-\nfelf at an inn in Canterbury, and as he\ncame into the hall, or firft room thereof,\nhe miftook the room, and went into the\nbuttery, where he efpied a maid, defcribed\nby Hodges, as before faid, drawing a\ncan of beer, &c. He then more nar-\nrowly viewing her perfon and habit, found\nher, in all parts, to be the fame Hodges\nhad defcribed ; after which he became a\nfuitor unto her, and was married unto\nher; which woman I have often feen.\nThis Scott related unto me feveral times,\nbeing a very honeft perfon, and made\ngreat confeience of what he fpoke. Ano-\nther ftory of him is as foiloweth, which\nI had related from a perfon which well\nknew the truth of it.\nA neighbour gentleman of Hodges loft\nhis horfe; who having Hodges's advice\nfor recovery of him, did again obtain\nhim. Some years after, in a frolick, he\nthought to abufe him, acquainting a\nneighbour\n\fof his Life and Times. 75\nneighbour therewith, viz. That he had\nformerly loft a horfe, went to Hodges,\nrecovered him again, but faith it was\nby chance ; I might have had him with-\nout going unto him :\nc\nCome, let's go, I\n* will now put a trick upon him ; I will\n* leave fome boy or other at the town's-\n\u20ac\nend with my horfe, and then go to Hodges\n<\nand enquire for him\/ He did fo, gave\nhis horfe to a youth, with orders to\nwalk him till he returned. Away he\ngoes with his friend, falutes Mr. Hodges,\nthanks him for his former courtefy, and\nnow defires the like, having loft a horfe\nvery lately. Hodges, after fome time of\npaufing, faid; * Sir, your horfe is loft,\n* and never to be recovered\/ * I thought\n' what fkill you had\/ replies the gallant,\n* my horfe is walking in a lane at the\n' town's-end\/ With that Hodges fwore\n(as he was too much given unto that\nvice) \u00ab your horfe is gone, and you will\nf never have him again\/ The gentleman\ndeparted in great derifion of Hodges,\nand went where he left his horfe 5 when\nhe came there, he found the boy faft\nafleep upon the ground, the horfe gone,\nthe boy's arm in the bridle.\nHe returns again to Hodges, defiring\nhis aid, being forry for his former abufe.\nOld Will fwore like a devil, * Be gone, be\nt.\ng\u00b0ne '> go look your horfe\/ Tl^is bufmefs\nended\n\f76 Mr. Lilly's History\nended not fo ; for the malicious man\nbrought Hodges into the ftar- chamber,\nbound him over to the affizes, put Hodges\nto great expences : but, by means of the\nLord Dudley, if I remember aright, or\nfome other peffon thereabouts, he over-\ncame the gentleman, and was acquitted.\nBefides this, a gentlewoman of my\nacquaintance, and of credit, in Leicefter-\nfhire, having loft a pillion-cloth, a very\nnew one, went to defire his judgment.\nHe ordered her fuch a day to attend at\nMountforrel in Leicefterfhire, and about\ntwelve o'clock fhe fhould fee her pillion-\ncloth upon a horfe, and a woman upon\nit. My friend attended the hour and\nplace ; it being told, fhe muft needs\nwarm herfelf well, and then enquired if\nany paffengers had lately gone by the inn ?\nUnto whom anfwer was made, there\npafTed by whilft fhe was at the fire, about\nnaif an hour before, a man, and a wo-\nman behind him, on horfe- back. Inquir-\ning of what colour the pillion-cloth was\nof , it was anfwered, direfrly of the colour\nmy friend's was : They purfued, but too\nlate.\nIn thofe times, there lived one William\nMarfh in Dunftable, a man of godly life\nand upright converfation, a Recufant. By\naftrology he refolved thievifh queftions\nwith great fuccefs ; that was his utmoft\nfole\n\fof his Life and Times. 77\nfole practice. He was many times in\ntrouble ; but by Dr. Napper's intereft with\nthe Earl of Bolingbroke, LordWentworth,\nafter Earl of Cleveland, he ftill conti-\nnued his praftice, the faid Earl not per-\nmitting any Juftice of Peace to vex him.\nThis man had only two books, Guido\nand Haly bound together : He had fo\nmumbled and tumbled the leaves of both,\nthat half one fide of every leaf was torn\neven to the middle, I was familiar with\nhim for many years : He died about\n1647.\nA word or two of Dr. Napper, who\nlived at Great Lindford in Buckingham-\nfliire, was parfon, and had the advowfon\nthereof. He defcended of worfhipful pa-\nrents, and this you muft believe ; for when\nDr. Napper's brother, Sir Robert Nap-\nper, a Turkey merchant, was to be made\na Baronet in King James's reign, there\nwas fome difpute whether he could prove\nhimfelf a gentleman far three or more\ndefcents. * By my faul\/ faith King James,\n* I will certify for Napper, that he is of\n* above three hundred years {landing in\n* his family, all of them, by my faul,\n* gentlemen,' &c. However, their family\ncame into England in King Henry the\nEighth's time. The parfon was Mafter of\nArts ; but whether doftorated by degree\nor courtefy, becaufe of his profeffion, I\nknow\n\fyS Mr. Lilly's History\nknow not. Mifcarrying one day in the\npulpit, he never after ufed it, but all\nhis life-time kept in his houfe fome ex-\ncellent fcholar or other to officiate for\nhim, with allowance of a good falary\n:\nHe out-went Forman in phyfick and\nholinefs of life ; cured the falling-fick-\nnefs perfeftly by conftellated rings, fome\ndifeafes by amulets, &c.\nA maid was much afflifted with the\nfalling-ficknefs, whofe parents applied\nthemfelves unto him for cure : he framed\nher a conftellated ring, upon wearing\nwhereof, fhe recovered perfeftly. Her\nparents acquainted fome fcrupulous divines\nwith the cure of their daughter :\n* The\n* cure is done by inchantment,' fay they.\n* Caft away the ring, it's diabolical ; God\n* cannot blefs you, if you do not caft the\n* ring away.' The ring was caft into the\nwell, whereupon the maid became epi-\nleptical as formerly, and endured much\nmifery for a long time. At laft her\nparents cleanfed the well, and recovered\nthe ring again ; the maid wore it, and\nher fits took her no more. In this con-\ndition fhe was one year or two ; which\nthe Puritan minifters there adjoining hear-\ning, never left off, till they procured her\nparents to caft the ring quite away\n;\nwhich done, the fits returned in fuch\nviolence, that they were enforced to ap-\nply\n\fof his Life and Times. 79\nply to the Doftor again, relating at\nlarge the whole ftory, humbly imploring\nhis once more affiftance ; but he could\nnot be procured to do any thing, only\nfaid, thofe who defpifed God's mercies,\nwere not capable or worthy of enjoying\nthem.\nI was with him in 1632, or 1633, upon\noccafion. He had me up into his library,\nbeing excellently furnifhed with very\nchoice books : there he prayed almoft\none hour he invocated feveral angels in\nhis prayer, viz. {a) Michael, Gabriel,\nRaphael, Uriel, &c.

I\nagain perufed all, or moft, authors I\nhad, fometimes adding, at other times\ndiminifhing, until at laft I thought it\nworthy of the prefs. When I came to\nframe the fecond part thereof, having for-\nmerly collected out of many manufcripts,\nand exchanged rules with the moft able\nprofeflbrs I had acquaintance with, in\ntranferibing thofe papers for impreflion,\nI found, upon a ftrift inquifition, thofe\nrules were, for the moft part, defective\n;\nfo that once more I had now a difficult\nlabour to correft their deficiencv, to new\nreftify them according to art ; and laftly,\nconfidering the multiplicity of daily ques-\ntions propounded unto me, it was as hard\na labour as might be to tranferibe the\npapers themfelves with my own hand.\nThe defire I had to benefit pofterity and\nmy country, at laft overcame all difficul -\nties ; fo that what I could not do in one\nyear, I perfected early the next year,\n16475 and then in that year, viz. 1647,\nI finiftied\n\fof his Life and Times. 83\nI finifhed the third book of {a) nativities,\n(6) during the compofing whereof, for\n(even whole weeks, I was fliut up of the\nplague, burying in that time two maid-\nservants thereof; yet towards November\nthat year, the Introduction, called by the\nname of Chriftian Aftrology was made\npublick.

That night\nthe Commiffioners came, and old Sea and\nhis Majefty had private conference till one\nin the morning : the King acquaints Sea\nwith his intention, who clearly diflwaded\nhim from figning the propofitions, telling\nhim they were not fit for him to fign\n;\nthat he had many friends in the Houfe of\nLords, and fome in the Houfe of Com-\nmons ; that he would procure more, and\nthen they would frame more eafy pro-\npofitions.

I had wrote pub-\nlickly in 1650, that the Parliament fhould\nnot continue, but a new government\nihould arife, &c.\nIn my next year's Anglicus, upon ra-\ntional grounds in aftrology, I was fo\nbold as to aver therein, that the Parlia-\nment flood upon a tottering foundation,\nand that the commonalty and foldiery\nwould join together againft them.\nMy Anglicus was for a whole week\nevery day in the Parliament Houfe, peep-\ned into by the PrenSyterians, one difliking\nthis fentence, another finds another fault,\nothers mifliked the whole ; fo in the end\na motion was made, that Anglicus fhould\nbe infpefted by the Committee for plun-\ndered minifters ; which being done, they\nwere to return them to the Houfe, viz.\nreport its errors.\nA meffenger attached me by A warrant\nfrom that Committee; I had private\nH 3 notice\n\f102 Mr. Lilly's History\nnotice ere the meflenger came, and hafted\nunto Mr. Speaker Lenthall, ever my\nfriend. He was exceeding glad to fee me,\ntold me what was done ; called for Angli-\ncus, marked the paffages which tormented\nthe Prefbyterians fo highly. I prefently\nfent for Mr. Warren the printer, an af-\nfured Cavalier, obliterated what was moft\noffenfive, put in other more fignificant\nwords, and (Jefired only to have fix a-\nmended againft next morning, which very\nhoneftly he brought me.

Whitlock is to go for Sweden.'\nBut fince I have nlentioned Oliver Croirn\nwell, I will relate fomething of him,\nwhich perhaps no other pen \u00a3an, or will\nmention. He was born of generous pa-\nrents in Huntingdonshire, educated fome\ntime at the univerfity of Cambridge : in\nhis youth was wholly given to debauchery,\nquarelling, drinking, &c. quid non ; hav-\ning by thofe nieafis wafted his patrimony,\nhe was enforced to bethink himfelf of\nleaving England, and go to New-Eng-\nland : he had hired a pafTage in a fhip,\nbut ere fhe launched out for her voyage,\na kinfman dieth, leaving him a confider-\nable fortune; upon which he returns,\npays his debts, became affe&ed to reli-\ngion; is elefted in 1640 a member of\nParliament, in 1642 made a Captain of\nhorfe under Sir Philip Stapleton, fought\nat Edge-Hill ; after he was made a Colo-\nnel, then Lieutertant-General to the Earl\nof Manchefteiy who was one of the three\nGenerals to fight the Earl of Newcaftle\nand Prince Rupert at York : Ferdinando\nLord Fairfax, and Earl Leven the Scot,\nwere the other two for the Parliament\n:\nthe laft two thinking all had been loft at\nMarfton-Moor fight, Fairfax went into\nCawood Caftle, giving all for loft: at\ntwelve at night there came word of the\nParliament's victory ; Fairfax being then\n'I laid\n\fii4 Lilly's History\nlaid down upon a bed, there was not a\ncandle in the caftle, nor any fire : up\nrifeth Lord Fairfax, procures after fome\ntime, paper, ink, and candle, writes to\nHull, and other garrifons of the Par-\nliament's, of the fuccefs, and then flept.\nLeven the Scot afked the way to Tweed :\nthe honour of that day's fight was given\nto Manchefter, Sir Thomas Fairfax's\nbrigade of horfe, and Oliver Cromwell's\niron fides ; for Cromwell's horfe, in\nthofe times, ufually wore head-pieces,\nback and breaft-plates, of iron. After\nthis viftory Cromwell became gracious\nwith the Houfe of Commons, efpecially\nthe Zealots, or Prelbyterians, with whom\nat that time he efpecially joined; the\nname Independent, at that time, viz.\n1644, being not fo much fpoken of.\nThere was fome animofity at or before\nthe fight, betwixt the Earl of Newcaftle\nand Prince Rupert ; for Newcaftle being\nGeneral of his Majefty's forces in the\nNorth, a perfon of valour, and well\nefteemed in thofe parts, took it not well\nto have a competitor in his concernments\n;\nfor if the victory fhould fall on his Maje-\nfty's fide, Prince Rupert's forces would\nattribute it unto their own General, viz.\nRupert, and give him the glory thereof\n:\nbut that it happened, Prince Rupert, in\nthat day's fight, engaged the Parliament's\nforces\n\fop his Life and Times. 115\nforces too foon, and before the Eari of\nNewcaftle could well come out of York\nwith his army ; by reafon whereof,\nthough Rupert had abfolutely routed the\nScots and the Lord Fairfax's forces ; yet-\nere timely affiftance could fecond his ar-\nmy, Sir Thomas Fairfax and Cromwell had\nput him to flight, and not long after all\nNewcaftle's army. Amongft themoft memo-\nrable aftions of that day's this happened,\nthat one entire regiment of foot belong-\ning to Newcaftle, called the Lambs, be-\ncaufe they were all new cloathed in white:\nwoollen cloth, two or three days before\nthe fight. This fole regiment, after the\nday was loft, having got into a fmall par-\ncel of ground ditched in, and not of eafy\naccefs of horfe, would take no quarter\n;\nand by mere valour, for one whole hour,\nkept the troops of horfe from entering\namongft them at near pufti of pike : when\nthe horfe did enter, they would have\nno quarter, but fought it out till there\nwas not thirty of them living : thofe\nwhofe hap it was to be beaten down upon\nthe ground as the troopers came near\nthem, though they could not rife for their\nwounds, yet were fo defperate as to get\neither a pike or fword, or piece of them,\nand to gore the troopers horfes as they\ncame over them, or palTed by them. Cap-\ntain Camby, then a trooper under Crom-\n\f1 1 6 Mr. Lilly's History\nwell, and an actor, who was the third or\nfourth man that entered amongft them,\nprotefted, he never in all the fights he\nwas in, met with fuch refolute brave\nfellows, or whom he pitied fo much, and\nfaid, ' he faved two or three againft their\n* wills.'\nAfter the fight, Manchefter marched\nflowly fouthward, &c. but at laft came\nwith his army to Newbery fight ; which\nended, he came for London, and there\nhe accufeth Cromwell, being his Lieute-\nnant, to the Parliament, of difobedience,\nand not obeying his orders.\nThe Houfe of Commons acquaint\nCromwell herewith, and charge him, as\nhe would anfwer it before God, that the\nday following he fhould give them a full\naccount of Manchefter's proceedings, and\nthe caufe and occafion of their difference,\nand of the reafons why Manchefter did\nnot timely move weftward for the relief\nof Eflex, then in the weft, who was\nabfolutely routed, inforced to fly, all his\nfoot taken, and all his ordnance and\ntrain of artillery, only the horfe efcaping.\nCromwell the next day gave this ac-\ncount to Mr. Speaker in the Houfe of\nCommons\u2014by way of recrimination.\nThat after God had given them a fuc-\ncefsful victory at Marfton over the King's\nforces, and that they had well refrefhed\ntheir\n\fof his Life and Times. 117\ntheir army, Manchefter, by their order,\ndid move fouthward, but with fuch flow-\nnefs, that fometimes he would not march\nfor three days together; fometimes he\nwould lie ftill one day, then two days\n;\nwhereupon he faid, confidering the Earl\nof ElTex was in the weft, with what\nfuccefs he then knew not, he moved\nManchefter feveral times to quicken his\nmarch to the weft, for relief of EfTex, if\nhe were beaten, or to divert the King's\nforces from following of Eflex ; but he\nfaid Manchefter ftill refufed to make any\nhafte ; and that one day he faid, *\nIf any\n' man but yourfelf, Lieutenant, fhould\n* fo frequently trouble me, I would call\nft\nhim before a Council of War. We\n* have beaten the King's forces in the\n* north ; if we fhould do fo in the weft,\n* his Majefty is then undone : He hath\n4\nmany fons living $ if any of them come\n* to the Crown, as they well may, they\n* will never forget us\/ This Major Ham-\nmond, a man of honour, will juftify\nas well as myfelf. After which he march-\ned not at all, until he had order from\nthe Committee to haften weftward, by\nreafon of Eflex's being loft in Corn-\nwall, which then he did; and at New-\nbery fight, it is true, I refufed to obey\nhis directions and order : for this it\nwas ; his Majefty's horfe being betwixt\nt 3 four\n\fn8 Mr. Lilly's History\nfour and five thoufand in a large com-r\nrnon, in good order, he commands me,\nMr. Speaker, to charge them; we hav^\ning no way to come at them but through\na narrow lane, where not above three\nhorfe could march abreaft ; whereby\nhad I followed his order, we had been\nall cut off ere we could have got into\nany order. Mr. Speaker, (and then he\nwept; which he could do toties quoties)\nI confidering that all the vifible army\nyou then had, wac by this counfel in\ndanger to be loft, refufed thus to en-\ndanger the main ftrength, which now\nmoft of all confifted of thofe horfe un-\nder my command, &c. This his re-\ncrimination was well accepted by ihe\nHoufe of Commons, who thereupon,\nand from that time, thought there was\nnone of the Houfe of Lords, very fit to\nfae entrufted with their future armies, but\nhad then thoughts of making a com-\nmoner their General; which afterwards\nthey did, and elefted Sir Thomas Fair-\nfax their General, and Cromwell Lieu-\ntenant- General ; but it was next fpring\nfirft. Upon EfTex's being loft in Corn-\nwall, I heard Serjeant Maynard fay, ' If\n* now the King hafte to London we are\n' undone, having no army to refift him.'\nHis Majefty had many misfortunes\never attending him, during his abode at\n2 Oxford j\n\fof his Life and Times. 119\nOxford; fome by reafon of that great\nanimofity betwixt Prince Rupert and the\nLord Digby, each endeavouring to crofs\none another -\n9 but the worft of all was\nby treachery of feveral officers under his\ncommand, and in his fervice ; for the\nParliament had in continual pay one\nColonel of the King's Council of War\n;\none Lieutenant-Colonel ; one Captain\n;\none Enfign; one or two Serjeants; feve-\nral Corporals, who had conftant pay, and\nduly paid them every month, according\nto the capacity of their offices and places,\nand yet none of thefe knew any thing of\neach other's being fo employed. There\nwere feveral well-wifliers unto the Parlia-\nment in Oxford, where each left his let-\nter, putting it in at the hole of a glafs-\nwindow, as he made water in the ftreet.\nWhat was put in at the window in any\nof thofe houfes, was the fame day con-\nveyed two miles off by fome in the ha-\nbit of town-gardeners, to the fide of a\nditch, where one or more were ever ready\nto give the intelligence to the next Par-\nliament garrifon : I was then familiar with\nall the fpies that conftantly went in and\nout to Oxford.\nBut once more to my own aftions. I\nhad in 1652 and 1653 and 1654 much\ncontention with Mr. Gatacre of Rother-\nhithe, a man endued with all kind of\nI\n4 learningf\n\fi2o Mr. Lilly's History\nlearning, and the ableft man of the whole\nfynod of divines in the Oriental tongues.\nThe fynod had concluded to make an\nexpcfition upon the bible; fame under-\ntook one book, fome another. Gatacre\nfell upon Jeremy.

The\nfirft act they put the General upon was,\nto take down the city gates and port-\nculluTes, an aft which, the General faid,\nwas fitter for a Janizary to do than for\na General ; yet he effe&ed the Commands\nreceived, and then lodged in the city\nwith his army. The citizens took this\npulling down of their gates fo heinoufly,\nihat one night the ruder fort of them\nprocured all the rumps of beef, and\nother baggage, and publickly burnt them\nill the ftreets, in derifion of the then\nParliament,\n\f124 MR * Lilly's History\nParliament, calling them that now fat,\nThe Rump. This hurly-burly was ma-\nnaged as well by the General's foldiers\nas the citizens. The King's health was\npublickly drank all over the city, to the\nconfufion of the Parliament. The mat-\nter continued until midnight, or longer.\nThe Council of State, fitting at White-\nHall, had hereof no knowledge, until\nSir Martin Noell, a difcreet citizen, came\nabout nine at night, and then firft in-\nformed them thereof. The Council could\nnot believe it, until they had fent fome\nminifters of their own, who affirmed\nthe verity thereof. They were at a ftand,\nand could not refolve what to do ; at laft\nNevil Smith came, being one of them,\nand publickly protefted there was but one\nway to regain their authority, and to\nbe revenged of this affront, and to over-\nthrow the Lord General Monk, whom\nthey now perceived intended otherways\nthan he had pretended ; his counfel was,\nto take away Monk's commiffion, and to\ngive a prefent commiffion to Major-Gene-\nral Lambert to be their General ; which\ncounfel of his, if they would take and put\nit fpeedily in execution, would put an end\nunto all the prefent mifchiefs.

It is very rare, yea,\neven in our days, for any operator or\ntaafter to have the angels fpeak articu-\nlately ; when they do fpeak, it is like the\nIrifh, much in the throat.\nWhat further concerns his Majefty,\nwill more fully be evident about 1672 or\n1674, or, at fartheft, in 1076. And\nnow unto my own aftions in 1660.\nIn the firft place, my fee- farm rents,\nbeing of the yearly value of one hun-\ndred and twenty pounds, were all loft\nby his Majefty's coming to his reitera-\ntion 3 but I do fay truly, the iofs thereof\ndid never trouble me, or did I repine\nthereat.\nIn June of that year, a new Parlia-\nment was called, whereunto I was un-\nwillingly invited by two meflengers of the\nSerjeant at Arms. The matter where-\nupon I was taken into cuftody was, to\nexamine me concerning the perfon who\ncut off the King's head, viz* the late\nKing's.\nSir Daniel Harvey, of Surrey, got the\nbufineis moved againft me in great dif-\nK pleafure,\n\f130 Mr. Lilly's History\npleafure, becaufe, at the eleftion of new\nKnights for Surrey, I procured the whole\ntown of Walton to ftand, and give their\nvoices, for Sir Richard Onflow. The\nCommittee to examine me, were Mr.\nPrinn, one Colonel King, and Mr.\nRichard Wefton of Gray's-Inn.\nGod's providence appeared very much\nfor me that day, for walking in Weftmin-\nfter-Hall, Mr. Richard Pennington, fon\nto my old friend Mr. William Penning-\nton, met me, and enquiring the caufe\nof my being there, (aid no more, but\nwalked up and down the hall, and re-\nlated my kindnefs to his father unto very\nmany Parliament men of Chefhire and\nLancafhire, Yorkfhire, Cumberland, and\nthofe northern countries, who numeroufly\ncame up into the Speaker's chamber, and\nbade me be of good comfort : at laft he\nmeets Mr. Wefton, one of the three un-\nto whom my matter was referred for\nexamination, who told Mr. Pennington,\nthat he came purpofely to punifh me, and\nwould be bitter againft me; but hearing\nit related, viz. my Angular kindnefs and\nprefervation of old Mr. Pennington's\neftate, to the value of fix or feven thou-\nfand pounds, 4\nI will do him all the\n* good I can,' fays he. * I thought he\n* had never done any good ; let me fee\n' him, and let him ftand behind me where\nI fit\n:'\n\fof his L*fe and Times. i 3\n1\n'\nI fit I did fo. At my firft appearance,\nmany of the young members affronted\nme highly, and demanded feveral fcurril-\nlous queftions. Mr. Wefton held a pa-\nper before his mouth ; bade me anfwer\nnobody but Mr. Prinn ; I obeyed his\ncommand, and faved myfelf much trou-\nble thereby ; and when Mr. Prinn put\nany difficult or doubtful query unto me,\nMr. Wefton prompted me with a fit\nanfwer. At laft, after almoft one hour s\ntugging, I defired to be fully heard what\nI could fay as to the perfon who cut Charles\nthe Firft's head off. Liberty being given\nme to fpeak, I related what follows, viz.\nThat the next Sunday but one after\nCharles the Firft was beheaded, Robert\nSpavin, Secretary unto Lieutenant-Gene-\nral Cromwell at that time, invited him-\nfelf to dine with me, and brought An-\nthony Peirfon, and feveral others, along\nwith him to dinner: That their prin-\ncipal difcourfe all dinner-time, was only,\n'\nwho it was that beheaded the King ; one\nfaid it was the common hangman ; ano-\nther, Hugh Peters ; others alfo were no-\nminated, but none concluded. Robert\nSpavin, fo foon as dinner was done, took\nme by the hand, and carried me to the\nfouth window : faith he, < Thefe are all\n\u2022 miftaken,_they have not named the man\n' that did the fa& ; it was Lieutenant-\nK 2 Colonel\n\f^32 Mr. Lilly's History'\n'Colonel JO ICE;. I was in the room\n* when he fitted himfelf for the work,\n4\nltood behind him when he did it;\n*\nwhen done, went in again with him\n:\n* There is no man knows this but my\n' mafter, viz. Cromwell, Commiflary\n'\nIreton, and myfelf.' ' Doth not Mr.\n' Rufliworth know it?' faid I. < No, he\n* doth not know it,' faith Spavin. The\nfame thing Spavin fmce had often related\ntinto me when we were alone. Mr.\nPrinn did, with much civility, make a\nreport hereof in the Houfe yet Norfolk\nthe Serjeant, after my difcharge, kept\nme two days longer in arreft, purpofely to\nget money of me. He had fix pounds, and\nhis Meflenger forty fhillings ; and yet I was\nattached but upon Sunday, examined on\nTuefday, and then difcharged, though\nthe covetous Serjeant detained me until\nThurfday. By means of a friend, I cried\nquittance with Norfolk, which friend was\nto pay him his falary at that time, and\nabated Norfolk three pounds, which we\nfpent every penny at one dinner, without\ninviting the wretched Serjeant : but in\nthe latter end of the year, when the\nKing's Judges were arraigned at the Old-\nBailey, Norfolk warned me to attend,\nbelieving I could give information con-\ncerning Hugh Peters. At the fefliohs I\nattended during its continuance, but was\nnever\n\fof his Life and Times. 133\nnever called or examined. There I heard\nHarrifon, Scott, Clement, Peters, Hacker,\nScroop, and others of the King's Judges,\nand Cook the Sollicitor, who excellently-\ndefended himfelf ; I fay, I did hear what\nthey could fay for themfelves, and after\nheard the fentence of condemnation\npronounced againft them by the incom-\nparably rnodeft and learned Judge Bridg-\nman, now Lord Keeper of the Great\nSeal of England.\nOne would think my troubles for that\nyear had been ended ; but in January\ni66t, one Everard, a Juftice of Peace in\nWeftminfter, ere I was ftirring, fent a\nSerjeant and thirty four mufqueteers for\nme to White-Hall : he had twice that\nnight feized about fixty perfons, fup-\npofed fanaticks, very ddpicable perfons,\nmany whereof were aged, fome were\nwater-bearers, and had been Parliament -\nfoldiers ; others, of ordinary callings : all\nthefa were guarded unto White-Hall, into\na large room, until day-light, and then\ncommitted to the Gate-Houfe : I was had\ninto the guard-room, which I thought\nto be hell \\ fome therein were fleeping,\nothers fwearing, others fmoaking tobac-\nco. In the chimney of the room I be-\nlieve there was two bufhels of broken\ntobacco-pipes, almpil half one load of\nallies. Everard, about nine in the morn-\nK 3 ing,\n\f134 MR - Lilly's History\ning, comes, writes my mittimus for the\nGate-Houfe, then fhews it me : I muft\nbe contented. I defired no other cour-\ntefy, but that I might be privately carried\nunto the Gatc-Houfe by two foldiers\n;\nthat was denied. Among the miferable\ncrew of people, with a whole company^ of\nfoldiers, I marched to prilbn, and there\nfor three hours was in the open air upon\nthe ground, where the common houfe of\noffice came down. After three hours, I\nwas advanced from this (linking place up\nthe ftairs, where there was on one fide a\ncompany of rude fwearing perfons $ on\nthe other fide many (Quakers, who lo-\nvingly entertained me. As foon as I was\nfixed, I wrote to my old friend Sir Ed-\nward Walker, Garter King at Arms,\nwho prefently went to Mr. Secretary Ni-\ncholas, and acquainted him with my con-\ndition. He ordered Sir Edward to write to\nEverard to releafe me, unlefs he had any\nparticular information againft me, which\nhe had not, He further faid, it was not\nhis Majefty's pleafure that any of his\nfubjefts fhould be thus had to prifon\nwithqut good caufe (hewed before.

However I muft\nand did appear ; and let me never forget\nthat great affection and care yourfelf (Oh\nmoft excellent and learned Efquire Afh-\nmole) (liewed unto me at that time. Firft,\nyour affection in going along with me\nall that day ; fecondly, your great pains\nand care, in fpeaking unto many worthy\nMembers of that Committee your ac-\nquaintance,\n\f142 Mr. Lilly's History\nquaintance, that they fhould befriend me>\nand not permit me to be affronted, or\nhave any difgraceful language caft upon\nme. I muft ferioufly acknowledge the\nperfuafions fo prevailed with thofe gene-\nrous fouls, that I conceive there was\nnever more civility ufed unto any than\nunto myfelf ; and you know, there were\nno fmall number of Parliament men ap-\npeared, when they heard I was to be\nthere.\nSir Robert Brooke fpoke to this pur-\npofe\n:\nf Mr. Lilly, This Committee thought\n* fit to fummon you to appear before them\n* this day, to know, if you can fay any\n* thing as to the caufe of the late fire, or\n* whether there might be any defign\n' therein. You are called the rather hi-\n' ther, becaufe in a book of yours long\n* fince printed, you hinted fomef fuch thing\n* by one of your Hieroglyphicks\/ Unta\nwhich I replied,\nMay it pleafe your Honours,\n* After the beheading of the late King;\n* confidering that in the three fubfequent\n*\nyears the Parliament a6ted nothing which\n4\nconcerned the fettlement of the nation\n* in peace ; and feeing the generality of\n* people diffatisfied, the citizens of Lon-\n'\ndon difcon tented, the foldiery prone to\n* mutiny,\n\fof his Life and Times. 145\nc\nmutiny, I was defirous, according to\n* the beft knowledge God had given me,\n*\nto make enquiry by the art I ftudied,\n4\nwhat might from that time happen unto\n4\nthe Parliament and nation in general.\n4\nAt laft, having fatisfied myfdf as well as\n' I could, and perfected my judgment\n* therein, I thought it mod convenient\n* to fignify my intentions and conceptions\n' thereof, in Forms, Shapes, Types,\n* Hieroglyphicks, &c. without any com-\n* mentary, that fo my judgment might\n' be concealed from the vulgar, and made\n* manifeft only unto the wife. I herein\n4\nimitating the examples of many wife\n' philofophers who had done the like\/\n* Sir Robeit\/ faith one, ' Lilly is yet\n4\nfitb vejtibulo'\nI proceeded further. Said I, \u00ab Having\n* found, Sir, that the city of London\n* (hould be fadly afflifted with a great\n* plague, and not long after with an\n* exorbitant fire, I framed thefe two\n* hieroglyphicks as reprefented in the\n4\nbook, which in effect have proved very\n4\ntrue.'\n* Did you forefee the- year\/ faid one?\n4\nI did not,' faid I, '\nor was defirous\n:\n* of that I made no fcrutiny\/ I pro-\nceeded\n4\nNow, Sir, whether there was any de-\n4\nfign of burning the city, or any em-\n4\nployed\n\f144 MR - Lilly's History\n' ployed to that purpofe, I muft deal iit-\n' genuoufly with you, that fince the fire,\n*\nI have aken much pains in the fearch\ni thereof, but cannot or could not give\n* myfelf any the leaft fatisfa&ion there-\n* in. I conclude, that it was the only\n\u20ac\nfinger of God ; but what inftruments\n* he ufed thereunto, I am ignorant\/\nThe Committee feemed well pleafed with\nwhat I fpoke, and difmifled me with great\ncivility.\nSince which time no memorable aftion\nhath happened unto me, my retirement\nimpeding all concourfe unto me.\nI have many things more to com-\nmunicate, which I fhall do, as they offer\nthemfelves to memory.\nIn Anno 1634, and 1635, I had much\nfamiliarity with John Hegenius, Do\u00a3lor\nof Phyfick, a Dutchman, an excellent\nfcholar and an able phyfician, not meanly\nverfed in aftrology. Unto him, for his\ngreat civility, I communicated the art of\nframing Sigils, Lamens, &c. and the ufe\nof the Mofaical Rods :\n\u2014 and we did\ncreate feveral Sigils to very good purpofe.\nI gave him the true key thereof, viz.\ninftrufted him of their forms, charac-\nters, words, and laft of all, how to give\nthem vivification, and what number or\nnumbers were appropriated to every pla-\nva j i net\n:\n\fof his Life and Times. 145\nrt\u20act : Cum multis aliis in libris veterum\nlatentibus ; aut perfpicue non intelleffiis.\nI was well acquainted with the Specu-\nlator of John a Windor, a fcrivener,\nfometimes living in Newbury. This\nWindor was club-fifted, wrote with a\npen betwixt both his hands. I have feen\nmany bonds and bills wrote by him. He\nwas much given to debauchery, fo that\nat fome times the Daemons would not\nappear to the Speculator ; he would then\nfuffumigate : fometimes, to vex the fpirits,\nhe would cUrfe them, fumigate with con-\ntraries. Upon his examination before Sir\nHenry Wallop, Kt. which I have feen,\nhe faid, he once vifited Dr. Dee in Mort-\nlack ; and out of a book that lay in the\nwindow, he copied out that call which he\nufed, when he invocated\nIt was that\u2014which near the beginning\nof it hath thefe words,\nPer virtutem illorwn qui invocant nomen tuum9\nHermeli\n\u2014\nrnitte nobis tres Angelos^ &c,\nWindor had many good parts, but was\na moft lewd perfon : My mafter Wright\nknew him well, and having dealing in\nthofe parts, made ufe of him as a fcri-\nvener.\nOliver Withers, fervant to Sir H. Wal-\nlop, brought up a Windor's examination\nL unto\n\f146 Mr. Lilly's History\nunto London, purpofely for me to pe-\nrufe. This Withers was Mr. Fiike's\nfcholar three years more or lefs, to learn\naftrology of him ; but being never the\n\\vifer, Filke brought him unto me : by\nfhewing him but how to judge one fi-\ngure, his eyes were opened : He made\nthe Epiftie before Dr. Neve's book, now\nin Mr. Sander's hands, was very learned\nin the Latin, Greek and Hebrew tongues.\nHaving mentioned Dr. John Dee, I\nhold it not impertinent to fpeak fome-\nthing of him; but more especially of\nEdward Kelly's Speculator.\nDr. Dee himfelf was a Cambro Briton,\neducated in the univerfity of Oxford,\nthere took his degree of Doctor after-\nwards for many years in fearch of the\nprofounder ftudies, travelled into foreign\nparts : to be ferious, he was Queen Eli-\nzabeth's intelligencer, and had a falary\nfor his maintenance from the Secretaries\nof State. He was a ready witted man,\nquick of appreheiifion, very learned, and\nof great judgment in the Latin and Greek\ntongues. He was a very great invefti-\ngator of the more fecret Hermeticai\nlearning, a perfeft aftronomer, a curious\naftrologer, a ferious geometrician ; to fpeak\ntruth, he was excellent in all kinds of\nlearning.\nWith\n\fof his Life and Times. 147\nWith all this, he was the moll ambi-\ntious perfon living, and moft defirous of\nfame and renown, and was never fo well\npleafed as when he heard himfelf ftiled,\nMoft Exellent.\nHe was ftudious in chymiftry, and at-\ntained to good perfeftion therein; but\nhis fervant, or rather companion, Kelly,\nout-went him, viz. about the Elixir or\nPhilofopher's Stone ; which neither Kelly\nor Dee attained by their own labour and\ninduftry. It was in this manner Kelly\nobtained it, as I had it related from an\nancient minifter, who knew the certainty\nthereof from an old Englifh merchant,\nrefident in Germany, at what time both\nKelly and Dee were there.\nDee and Kelly being in the confines of\nthe Emperor's dominions, in a city where\nrefided many Englifh merchants, with\nwhom they had much familiarity, there\nhappened an old Friar to come to Dr.\nDee's lodging. Knocking at the door,\nDee peeped down the flairs. * Kelly\/\nfays he, ' tell the old man I am not at\n* home\/ Kelly did fo. The Friar faid, * I\n* will take another time to wait on him\/\nSome few days after, he came again.\nDee ordered Kelly, if it were the fame\nperfon, to deny him again. He did fo\n;\nat which the Friar was very angry, ' Tell\nL 2 \u00ab thy\n\fI\n148 Mr. Lilly's History\n4\nthy mafter I came to fpeak with him and\n' to do him good, becaufe he is a great\n* fcholar and famous ; bat now tell him,\n* he put forth a book, and dedicated it to\n* the Emperor : it is called Monas Hiero-\n* gliphicas. He underftands it not. I\n* wrote it myfelf, I came to inftruft him\n* therein, and in fome other more pro-\n* found things. Do thou, Kelly, come\n* along with me, I will make thee more\n* famous than thy mafter Dee.'\nKelly was very apprehenfive of what\nthe Friar delivered, and thereupon fud-\ndenly retired from Dee, and wholly ap-\nplied unto the Friar ; and of him either\nhad the Elixir ready made, or the perfect\nmethod of its preparation and making.\nThe poor Friar lived a very fhort time\nafter : whether he died a natural death,\nor was otherwile poifoned or made away\nby Kelly, the merchant who related this,\ndid not certainly know.\nHow Kelly died aftenvards at Prague,\nyou well know : he was born at Wor-\ncefter, had been an apothecary. Not a-\nbove thirty years fmce he had a fifter lived\nin Worcester, who had fome gold made\nby her brother's projedion.\nDr. Dee died at Mortlack in Surrey,\nvery poor, enforced many times to fell\nfome book or other to buy his dinner\nwith, as Dr. Napier of Linford in Buck-\ninghamfhire\n\fof ins Life and Times. 149\ninghamfhire oft related, who knew him\nvery well.\nI have read over his book of Confe-\nrence with Spirits, and thereby perceive\nmany weaknefles in the manage of that\nway of Mofaical learning : but I con-\nceive, the reafon why he had not more\nplain refolutions, and more to the pur-\npofe, was, becaufe Kelly was very vicious,\nunto whom the angels were not obe-\ndient, or willingly did declare the quef-\ntions propounded ; but I could give other\nreafons, but thofe are not for paper.\nI was very familiar with one Sarah\nSkelhorn, who had been Speculatrix unto\none Arthur Gauntlet about Gray's-Inn-\nLane, a very lewd fellow, profefling phy-\nfick. This Sarah had a perfeft fight, and\nindeed the beft eyes for that purpofe I\never yet did fee. Gauntlet's books, after\nhe was dead, were fold, after I had pe-\nrufed them, to my fcholar Humphreys:\nthere were rare notions in them. This\nSarah lived a long time, even until her\ndeath, with one Mrs. Stockman in the\nIfle of Purbeck, and died about fixteen\nyears fince. Pier miftrefs one time being\ndefirous to accompany her mother, the\nLady Beconsfield, unto London, who\nlived twelve miles from her habitation,\ncaufed Sarah to infpect her cryital, to\nfee if file, yiz, her mother, was gone,.\nt 3 yea\n\f150 Mr. Lilly's History\nyea or not : the angels appeared, and\nfhewed her mother opening a trunk, and\ntaking out a red waiftcoat, whereby fhe\nperceived fhe was not gone. Next day fhe\nwent to her mother's, and there, as fhe\nentered the chamber, fhe was opening\na trunk, and had a red waiftcoat in her\nhand. Sarah told me oft, the angels\nwould for fome years follow her, and\nappear in every room of the houfe, until\nfhe was weary of them.\nThis Sarah Skelhorn, her call unto the\ncryftal began,\n\u2022 Oh ye good angels, only and only,' &c.\nEllen Evans, daughter of my tutor\nEvans, her call unto the cryftal was this :\nO Micoly O tu Micoly regina pigmeorum\nveni, &c.\nSince I have related of the Queen of\nFairies, I fhall acquaint you, that it is not\nfor every one, or every perfon that thefe\nangelical creatures will appear unto, though\nthey may fay over the call, over and\nover, or indeed is it given to very many\nperfons to endure their glorious afpefts\n;\neven very many have failed juft at that\nprefent when they are ready to manifeft\nthemfelves ; even perfons otherwife of\nundaunted fpirits and firm refolution, are\nherewith aftonifhed, and tremble ; as it\nhappened not many years fince with us.\nA very fober difcreet perfon, of virtuous\n\fof his Life and Times. 151\nlife and converfation, was beyond meafure\ndefirous to fee fornething in this nature.\nHe went with a friend into my Hurft\nWood : the Queen of Fairies was invo-\ncated, a gentle murmuring wind came firft\n;\nafter that, amongft the hedges, a fmart\nwhirlwind; by and by a ftrong biaft of wind\nblew upon the face of the friend,\u2014and\nthe Queen appearing in a moft iiluftrious\nglory, '\nNo more, I befeech you,' (quoth\nthe friend:) 'My heart fails j\nI am not\n4\nable to endure longer.' Nor was he : his\nblack curling hair rofe up, and I believe\na bullrufh would have beat him to the\nground : he was foundly, laughed at, &c.\nSir Robert Holborn, Knight, brought\nonce unto me (a) Gladwell of Suffolk, who\nhad formerly had fight and conference\nwith Uriel and Raphael, but loft them\nboth by carelefihefs ; fo that neither of\nthem both would but rarely appear, and\nthen prefently be gone, refolving nothing.\nHe would have given me two hundred\npounds to have aflifted him for their\nrecovery, but I am no fqch man.\u2014Thofe\nglorious creatures, if well commanded,\nand well obferved, do teach the matter\n(a) Mr. Gilbert Wakering gave him his berril\nwhen he died ; ii was of the largenefs qf a good big\norange, fet in ftlver, with a crofs on the top, and ano-\nther on the handle ; and round about engraved the\nnames of thefe angeis, Raphael, Qabrjel, IJnel.\nh 4 ^ny\n\f152 Mr. Lilly's History\nany thing he defires ; Amantfccreta, fugi-\nunt aperta. The Fairies love the fouthern\nfide of hills, mountains, groves.\u2014Neat-\nnefs and cleanlinefs in apparel, a ftrift\ndiet, an upright life, fervent prayers unto\nGod, conduce much to the affiftance of\nthofe who are curious thefe ways.\nIt hath been my happinefs to meet\nwith many rarities in my time unex-\npectedly. I had a fitter lived in the\nMinories, in that very houfe where fcav\nmerly had lived one Evans, not my tu-\ntor, but another far exceeding him in\naftrology, and all other occult learning,\nqueftioned for his life about 16 12. I am\nfure it was when the prefent Earl of\nManchefter's father was Lord Chief Juf-\ntice of England. He was found guilty\nby a peevifh Jury : but petitioning King\nJames by a Greek petition, as indeed he\nwas an excellent Grecian ; f By my faul\/\nfaid King James, ' this man fhall not\nc\ndie ; I think he is a better Grecian\n* than any of my Bifiiops :'\nfo his life\nwas fpared, &c. My filler's mafter when\nnew modelling the houfe, broke up a\nwindow, under which were Evans's fecret\nmanufcripts, and two moulds in brafs ;\none of a man, the other of a woman.\nI bought the moulds and (a) book for\n(a) From thefe manufcripts he gained his firft\nknowledge.\nfive\n\fof his Life and Times. 153\nfive (hillings; the fecrets were wrote in\nan imperfect Greek character ; but after\nI found the vowels, all the reft were pre-\nfently clear enough.\nYou fee, moft worthy Sir, I write\nfreely; it is out of the fmcerity of my\naffection, many things wrote by me hav-\ning been more fit for a fepulture than a\nbook : But,\n\u00a7>uo major eft virorum frajlantium> tui\nfimiliwn inopia ; eo mihi charior ejl, & effe\ndebet & amicitia tua : Quam quidem omnibus\nqfficiis, &Jludiis, quce a fumma benevole?itia\npojjunt, perpetub colam : However, who\nftudy the curiofities before-named, if they\nare not very well verfed in aftrology,\nthey fhall rarely attain their defired ends.\nThere was, in the late times of troubles,\none Mortlack, who pretended unto Spe-\nculations, had a eryftal, a call of Queen\nMab, one of the Queen of Fairies ; he\ndeluded many thereby: at laft I was\nbrought into his company ; he was de-\nfiled to make invocation, he did fo ; no-\nthing appeared, or would : three or four\ntimes in my company he was put upon\nto do the work, but could not; at laft\nhe faid he could do nothing as long as I\nwas in prefence. I at laft fhewed him his\nerror, but left him as I found him, a\npretended ignoramus.\nI may\n\f154 MR - Lilly's History\nI may feem to fome to write incredibilia ;\nbe it fo, but knowing unto whom, and\nfor whofe only fake, I do write them,\nI am much comforted therewith, well\nknowing you are the moft knowing man\nin thefe curiofities of any now living in\nEngland ; and therefore it is my hope,\nthele will be a prefent well-becoming you\nto accept.\nPrceclara omnia quam difficilia Jint, his\nprtefertim temporibus .\n(\nCeleberrbrie Armiger, )\nnan te fngit and therefore I will acquaint\nyou with one memorable ftory related\nunto me by Mr. John Marr, an excellent\nmathematician and geometrician, whom\nI conceive you remember : he was fervant\nto King James and Charles the Firft.\nAt firft, when the Lord Napier, or\nMarchifton made publick his Logarithms,\nMr. Briggs, then reader of the aftrono-\nmy lecture at Grefham-College in Lon-\ndon, was fo furprized with admiration of\nthem, that he could have no quietnefs,\nin himfelf, until he had feen that noble\nperfon the Lord Marchifton, whofe only\ninvention they were : he acquaints John\nMarr herewith, who went into Scotland\nbefore Mr. Briggs, purpofely to be there\nwhen thefe two fo learned perfons fhould\nmeet. Mr. Briggs appoints a certain day\nwhen to meet at Edinburgh : but failing\nthereof, the Lord Napier was doubtful he\nwould\n\fOF HIS klFE AND TlMES. I\n55\nwould not come. It happened one day\nas John Marr and the Lord Napier were\nfpeaking of Mr. Briggs ;\nf\nAh, John\/\nfaith Marchifton, ' Mr. Briggs will not\n' now come:' at the veryinftant one knocks\nat the gate ; John Marr hafted down, and\nit proved Mr. Briggs, to his great con-\ntentment. He brings Mr. Briggs up into\nmy Lord's chamber, where almoft one\nquarter of an hour was fpent, each be-\nholding other almoft with admiration,\nbefore one word was fpoke : at laft Mr.\nBriggs began.\n* My Lord, I have undertaken this\n* long journey purpofely to fee your per-\n* fon, and to know by what engine of\n' wit or ingenuity you came firft to think\n* of this moft excellent help unto aftro-\n' nomy, viz. the Logarithms ; but, my\n* Lord, being by you found out, I won-\n* der no body elfe found it out before,\n* when now known, it is fo eafy.' He\nwas nobly entertained by the Lord Na-\npier, and every fummer after that, during\nthe Lord's being alive, this venerable man,\nMr. Briggs, went purpofely into Scot-\nland to vifit him. Tempora nunc mutantur.\nThefe two perfons were worthy men in\ntheir time ; and yet the one, viz. Lord\nMarchifton, was a great lover of aftro-\nlogy, but Briggs the moft fatirical man\nagainft it that hath been known : but the\nreafon\n\f156 Mr. Lilly's History*\nreafon hereof I conceive was, that Briggs\nwas a fevere Prefbyterian, and wholly\nconverfant with perfons of that judg-\nment; whereas the Lord Marchifton was\na general fcholar, and deeply read in all\ndivine and human hiftories : it is the\nfame Marchifton who made that moft feri-\nous and learned expofition upon the Re-\nvelation of St. John ; which is the beft\nthat ever yet appeared in the world.\nThus far proceeded Mr. William Lilly\nin fetting down the account of his life,\nwith fome other things of note. Now\nfhall be added fomething more which\nafterwards happened during his retire-\nment at his houfe at Herfham, until his\ndeath.\nHe left London in the year 1665, (as\nhe hath before noted) and betook him-\nfelf to the ftudy of pbyfick; in which,\nhaving arrived at a competent degree of\nknowledge, affifted by diligent obfervation\nand practice, he defired his old friend\nMr. Afhmole, to obtain of his Grace Dr.\nSheldon, then Lord Achbifhop of Can-\nterbury, a licenfe for the practice of phy-\nfick ; which upon application to his Grace,\nand producing a teftimonial [O&ober 8.\n1670,] under the hands of two phyficians\nof the college in London, on Mr. Lilly's\nbehalf, he moft readily granted, in the\nmanner following, viz.

From\nthole that were more able, he now and\nthen\n\fof his Life and Times. 15^\nthen received a fhilling, and fometimes\nan half crown, if they offered it to him,\notherwife he demanded nothing ; and, in\ntruth, his charity towards poor people\nwas very great, no lefs than the care and\npains he took in confidering and weighing\ntheir particular cafes, and applying proper\nremedies to their infirmities, which gained\nhim extraordinary credit and eftimation.\nHe was of a flrong conftitution, and\ncontinued generally in good health, till\nthe 1 6th of Auguft 1674, when a vio-\nlent humour difcovered itfelf in red fpots\nall over his body, with little pufhes in\nhis head. This, in the winter [18 De-\ncember] following, was feconded by a\ndiftemper w7\nhereof he fell fick, and was\nlet blood in the left foot, a little above\nthe ancle.\nThe 20th of December following, a\nhumour defcended from his head to his\nleft fide, from eight o'clock at night till\nthe next mornii>g; and then flaying a\nwhile in the calf of his leg, at length\ndefcended towards his toes, the anguifh\nwhereof put him into a fever. This hu-\nmour fixed in two places on the top of\nhis left foot (one in that where he was\nlet blood two days before) which (upon\napplication of pledgets) growing ripe, they\nwere [28 Dec] lanced by Mr. Agar of\nKingfton, his apothecary (and no lefs a\nfkilful\n\fl6o Mr. Lilly's Historv\nfkilful Surgeon :) after which he be-\ngan to be at eafe, his fever abated, and\nwithin five months the cure was per-\nfected.\nThe 7th of November 1675, he was\ntaken with a violent fit of vomiting for\nfome hours, to which a fever fucceeded,\nthat continued four months : This brought\nhis body exceeding low, together with a\ndimnefs in his eyes, which after occafioned\nhim to make ufe of Mr. Henry Coley, as\nhis amanuenfis, to tranfcribe (from his\ndictates) his aftrological judgments for\nthe year 1677; but the monthly obfer-\nvations for that year, were written with\nhis own hand fome time before, though\nby this time he was grown very dim-\nfighted. His judgments and obfervations\nfor the fucceeding years, till his death,\n(fo alfo for the year 1682,) were all com-\npofed by his directions, Mr. Coley com-\ning to Herfham the beginning of every\nfummer, and frayed there, till, by con-\nference with him, he had difpatched them\nfor the prefs ; to whom, at thefe oppor-\ntunities, he communicated his way of\njudgment, and other aftrological ar-\ncana's.\n'\u00bb\nIn the beginning of the year 1681, he\nhad a flux, which weakened him much,\nyet after fome time his ftrength encreafed;\nbut now his fight was wholly taken from\nhim,\n\fof his Life and Times. 161\nhim, not having any glimmering as for-\nmerly.\nHe had dwelt many years at Herfham,\nwhere his charity and kindnefs to his\npoor neighbours was always great and\nhearty; and the 30th of May 168 1, to-\nwards the evening, a dead palfy began\nto feize his left fide. The fecond of\nJune, towards evening, he took his bed,\nand then his tongue began to falter.

He died in the begin-\nning of his climafterical year, fatal many\ntimes where killing directions in the na-\ntivity threaten. Several charafters are\ngiven of him ; fome do too much mag-\nnify him, others as much vilify him. He\nwas well educated by his father under\ncareful tutors, men of great knowledge\nin all manner of qualities, fit for educa-\ntion of princes ; and came to the crown\nbeing,\n\f176 On the Liee and Death\nbeing aged twenty-four years and about\nfour months, even in the flower of his\nage. Of his infancy we have little to\nmention, only he was noted to be very\nwilful and obftinate by Queen Anne his\nmother, and fome others who then were\nabout him. His mother being told he\nwas very f\\ck and like to die, faid, He\nwould not then die, or at that time, but\nlive to be the ruin of himfelf, and the\noccafion of the lofs of his three King-\ndoms, by his too much wilfulnefs : A\nfad prediction from a mother, who moft\nentirely loved him ; but it proved very true\nin the fequel. Some affirm file had that\nforefight of his condition from a ftranger,\nwho had not only great judgment in nati-\nvities, but in the more fecret learning ;\nothers, that one Englifh, a Scot, inform-\ned her thereof firft. Queen Anne may be\nthoughtto have the fpirit of prophecy in\njudging fo rightly on her fon and daugh-\nter ; for (he fo much fcorned and under-\nvalued the Palfgrave for a hufband unto\nthe Lady Elizabeth, that in moft of her\nlanguage after and before the marriage,\nfhe would call her Goodwife Palfgrave;\na name and title fhe thought good enough\nfor any woman fhould marry that dull and\nunfortunate man : and indeed her fears\nand predictions proved moft true. ,\nThe\nold Scotifh Lady his nurfe was ufed to\n1 affirm\n\fof King CHARLES' I. 177\naffirm as much, and that he was of a very-\nevil nature even in his infancy; and the\nlady, who after took charge of him, can-\nnot deny it, but that he was beyond mea-\nfure wilful, and unthankful : Yet while\nhe was young, he followed his book feri-\noufly, which his elder brother Prince\nHenry could not endure ; and therefore\nKing James would frequently blame\nPrince Henry with the negleft of his\nbook, and tell him how his brother Charles\nfollowed it ; whereupon the Prince would\nreply, when that he himfelf fliould be\nKing, he would make his brother Charles\nArchbifliop of Canterbury. And to fpeak\ntruly of him, he had many Angular parts\nin nature ; he was an excellent horfeman,\nwould fhoot well at a mark, had Angular\nIkill in limning and pictures, a good ma-\nthematician, not unlkilful in mufick, well\nread in divinity, excellently in hiftory,\nand no lefs in the laws and ftatutes of\nthis nation ; he had a quick and fliarp\nconception, would write his mind Angu-\nlarly well, and in good language and\nftile, only he loved long Parenthefes. He\nwould apprehend a matter in difference\nbetwixt party and party with great readi-\nngs, and methodife a long matter, or\ncontract it in few lines : infomuch as I\nhave heard Sir Robert Holborne oft fay,\nhe had a quicker conception, and would\nN fooner\n\f178 On the Life and Death\nfooner underftand a cafe in law, or with\nmore fharpnefs drive a matter unto a\nhead, than any of his Privy Council ; in-\nfomuch, that when the King was not at\nthe Council Tabic, Sii Robert never cared\nto be there. He had alio, amongft other\nhis fpecial gifts, the gift of patience ; in-\nfomuch, that if any offered him a long\ndifcourfe or fpeech, he would with much\npatience, and without any interruption or\ndiftafte, hear a fpeech or ftory out at\nlength ; but then he would expect the\nfame civility from others. He was a great\nadmirer of his Queen (if he diffembled\nnot), very uxorious, feldom denying her\nany requeft, and for' her fake was very\ncivil to the old Queen of France her mo-\nther. The height of his affection unto\nthe Queen, fully you may perceive in\nthofe tranfeendent expreffions of his, in\nletters fent unto her, the copies whereof\nwere intercepted at Nafebv, and fince\nprinted -\ny his conclufion being always,\n<c\nThine eternally,\" or, \" Farewel dear\n\u00ab\u2022 heart.\"\nHe communicated bis weightieft, and\nmoft private defigns unto her; nay, tbere\nwas very little of any moment, but fhe\nwhs advifed with concerning it : and yet,\nwhat reafon the Queen knew to the con-\ntrary, I could not learn, but ihe more\nthan\n\fof King CHARLES I.\n179\nthan once twitted him in the teeth with\ndiflembling, &C. a quality which indeed\nhe was as fufficiently mafter of as any\nman living, and which queftionlefs he\nhad partly from his father, and partly\nfrom the climate he was born in, viz.\nScotland. An indulgent father, careful,\nif not too covetous to have provided pa-\ntrimonies for his children ; for he would\noften fay, when fome beggarly courtier\npropounded a monopoly or projeft unto\nhim, affirming it would produce unto\nhis coffers fo many thoufand pounds a\nyear, or much increafe his revenue; he\nwould prefently fend for the Judges, or\nfome of his Counfel at Law, and if they\naffirmed and confented he might by law\ngrant the thing defired, he often would\nfay, * He knew no reafon, but that he\n* might grant the matter in queftion,\nf\n. fith the thing itfelf was juft and law-\n* ful, for he had many children to pro-\n\u20ac\nvide for\/ Before the wars he was a\ngreat enemy to bloodfhed, or wilful mur-\nder, infomuch, that when one Stamford\nhad in an infurreclion in Fleet-ftreet, kil-\nled a man, he could by no means be drawn\nto fign a pardon unto him, though Stam-\nford had been Buckingham's favourite\nand countryman, and very great inter-\nceffion had been made unto him for his\npardon. Where he once really affe&ed,\nN 2 he\n\f1 8\u00a9 On the Life and Death\nhe was ever a perfeft friend ; witnefs his\ncontinuance of affe&ion unto all Buck-\ningham's friends after his death, yea, un-\ntil his own laft decay of fortune. He\nwas a great lover, if not too much, of\nthe clergy, and highly advanced them ; in-\nfomuch, as under him they grew firft in-\nfolent, and then faucy ; and indeed, his\nindulgence unto them did in pait procure\nunto himfelf the people's hate. Whether\nhis indulgence unto the clergy, proceeded\nfrom a religious affeftion rather to ad-\nvance the ways of righteoufnefs, or God's\ncaufe, than his own private defigns, it\nhath been by many controverted $ but by\njudicious men adjudged, that his own felf-\nends were therein more fought after than\npropagating the gofpel ; fo that he ferved\nhimfelf by pretending to advance the\nclergy. He erred extreamly in this one\nbufinefs : when divers godly chriftians in\nNorfolk delivered him a petition againft\nthe tyrant Wren, their bifliop ; he lent\nfor Wren, and bad him anfwer it. No-\nvelties in doctrine he hated, as much as\nin ceremony. He loved not greatly the\nancient nobility or gentry of this nation\n;\nbut did rather prefer creatures of his own,\nor father's making. How much he loved\nany of the nobility or gentry, but for his\nown ends, he made it plainly appear at\nOxford, where he procured fundry of the\nEng-\n\fof King CHARLES I. 181\nEnglifh nobles, and many gentlemen,\nmembers of the Houfe of Commons, to\nrecede from the Parliament at Weftmin-\nfter, and convene at Oxford, where him-\nfelf was ; and after that this mock Par-\nliament, to fatisfy his defire, had convened\nand afiembled, done what they could,\nand thereby engaged their perfons and\neftates for him ; yet, becaufe they would\nnot in all things comply with his tyran-\nnical humour, in a letter of his unto the\nQueen, he complains of them unto her,\nand faid,\nc\nHe was fo troubled with a\n* mongrel Parliament, he could do no-\n* thing, &c\/ This fcornful epithet, or\nbadge of difgrace, was all the reward any\nof thofe unfortunate gentlemen had from\nhim ; but it was juft they fhould be fo\npaid their wages, that in fo traiterous a\nway deferted the Parliament at Weftmin-\nfter, which fits to this day, &c. He\ncared not much for the Common Law, or\nvery much for the Long Gown men ; he\nlearned that difaffeftion of his from his\nfather jemmy, who could not endure the\nLord Chief Juftice Coke, becaufe he ever\nfaid the Prerogative was bounded by Law,\nand was limitable \u2022 but that excellent pa-\ntriot was worfted for his dear affedtion to\nhis country, by Egerton the Chancellor,\nwho maintained the contrary; and was\nworthily as well rewarded by the old Scot\nN 3 for\n\f182 On the Life and Death\nfor his labour, Jemmy taking the Great\nSeal from him before he was dead, yea,\nin a difgraceful manner. The Common-\nalty of England he neither cared for, took\nmuch notice of, or much difrefpected\n;\nholding this opinion only, becaufe he was\ntheir King, they ought in duty to ferve\nhim. The Citizens of London, though\nthey much courted him with their flat-\nteries, and large gifts, and in his latefl\nextremities relieved him with confiderable\nfums of money, yea even at Oxford in foap\nbarrels ; yet he flighted them, thought\nthem ever too rich, and intended for them\na fevere revenge. Had he ever mattered\nthe Parliament, he was advifed, by one I\nwell knew, to have demoliflied half the\ncity : what he would have done had he\nbeen victorious, God knows. He would\noften fay, it was the nurfery of the\nprefent rebellion, for fa he called the\nwars, &c. and that the body of the city\nwas too large for the head. I have heard\nit from the mouths of many worthy gen-\ntlemen, whofe hap it was to ferve him in\nthe late wars, that they did believe, had\nhe, viz. the King, by arms conquered\nthis Parliament, he would have proved\nthe greateft tyrant the Englifh nation ever\nhad to rule other them, and therefore they\ndid ftill pray for a reconcilement betwixt\nthe Parliament and Him, but could never\nendure\n\fof King CHARLES I. 183\nendure to hear he fhould conquer our ar-\nmies, &c. And fo much in a manner *\ndropped out from the mouth of Rupert,\nwho giving command for executing fome\nthings contrary to the laws; and being ac-\nquainted with his miftake, \" Tufh,\" quoth\nhe, \" we will have no more law in Eng-\n<c\nland henceforward but the fword.\" He\nhad a natural imperfection in his fpeech,\nat fome times could hardly get out a word,\nyet at other times he would fpeak freely\nand articulately ; as the firft day of his\ncoming before the High Court of Juftice,\nwhere cafually I heard him ; there he\nftammered nothing at all, but fpoke very\ndiftinftly, with much courage and mag-\nnanimity. As a man he had his imper-\nfections, for he was veiy covetous and\ngripple, and fparing of his treafure (qua-\nlities nothing commendable in a King ;)\nand if at any time liberal, it was rather\nto the undeferving or boifterous fellows,\nthan well meriting : by how much the\nmore humbly any made their addreffes\nunto him, by fo much the more was he\nimperious, lofty, and at a diftance with\nthem ; whereupc 1 it moft an end hap-\npened, that the impudent and bold were\nrewarded, and the virtuous flighted ; which\nimperfection of his enforced a bold-fpi-\nrited Courtier to fay, ' There was no way\n* to get any boon from him, but by im-\nN 4 4\npudence,\n\f184 On the Life and Death\nc\npudence, and cajoling him with unbe-\nc\nfeeming language\/ Yet he himfelf was\nnever obfcene in his fpeech, or affefted it\nin others. I have only met with, or\ntaken notice of, two paffages, which\nargue him guilty of unbefeemimg lan-\nguage. Firft, in all or moft of his letters\nunto the Queen, he terms the Parliament\nrebels, though they were lawfully con-\nvened, and not diflblved, or to be dif-\nfolved, without their own confent ; but\ntime, and their victories, acquainted him\nwith more civil language, and taught\nhim to ftyle them a Parliament. In ano-\nther letter of his unto her, he calls the\nLord General Fairfax, who was then the\nParliament's General, their brutifh Gene-\nral ; a moft uncivil term and epithet to\nbeflow upon fo brave a man, fo civil, fo\nvaliant, and fo much a gentleman as Fair-\nfax was, and is. Affuredly the progeni-\ntors of the Lord Fairfax were gentlemen*\nand of good eftates then, and at what\ntime the anceftors of the Stuarts were\nbut poor ftewards unto a family in Scot-\nland : and what a preferment it is now,\nor was fome three hundred years fince, to\nbe bailiff or fteward unto a Scotifh. family,\nlet the whole world judge ; for this was\nthe true original of the rife and growth\nof the family of Stuarts, and no other;\nthough fince by marriage they came to be\nKings\n\fof King CHARLES I. 185\nKings of Scotland, (as their own chroni-\ncles relate). He did not greatly court the\nladies, nor had he a lavifh affe6tion unto\nmany. He was manly, and well fitted for\nvenerious fports, yet rarely frequented il-\nlicit beds. I do not hear of above one or\ntwo natural children he had, or left be-\nhind him. He had exquifite judgment\nby the eye, and phyfiognomy, to difcover\nthe virtuous from the wanton. He\nhonoured the virtuous, and was very fhy.\nand choice in wandring thofe ways, and\nwhen he did it, it was with much cauti-\noufnefs and fecrefy ; nor did he proftitute\nhis affeftion, but unto thofe of exquifite\nperfons or parts : and this the Queen well\nknew ; nor did fhe wink at it. He had\nmuch of felf-ends in all that he did, and\na molt difficult thing it was to hold him\nclofe to his own promife or word : he was\napt to .recede, unlefs fomething therein\nappeared compliable, either unto his own\nwill, profit, or judgment ; fo that fome\nforeign princes beftowed on him the cha-\nracter of a moft falfe prince, and one that\nnever kept his word, unlefs for his own\nadvantage. Had his judgment been as\nfound, as his conception was quick and\nnimble, he had been a moft accornplifhed\ngentleman : and though in moft dangerous\nrefults, and extraordinary ferious c6nfulta-\ntions, and very material, either for ftate\nor*\n\f*86 On the Life and Death\nor commonwealth, he would himfelf give\nthe moft folid advice, and found reafons;\nwhy fuch or fuch a thing fhoukl be lb,\nor not fo ; yet was he moft eafily with-\ndrawn from his own moft wholefome and\nfound advice or refolutions ; and with as\nmuch facility drawn on, inclined, to em-\nbrace a far more unfafe, and nothing io\nwholefome a counfel. He would argue\nlogically, and frame his arguments arti-\nficially -\ny yet never almoft had the happi-\nnefs to conclude or drive on a defign in\nhis own fenfe, but was ever baffled with\nmeaner capacities. He feared nothing\nin this world, or difdained any thing\nmore than the convention of a Par-\nliament ; the very name was a bugbear\nunto him. He was ever refraftory againft\nthe fummoning of a Parliament, and as\nwillingly would embrace an opportunity\nto break it off. This his averfenefs be-\ning well known to fome grave members,\nthey contrived at laft by wit, and the\nneceflity of the times, that his hands were\nfaft tied up in granting a triennial fit-\nting, or a perpetuity as it were unto\nthis prefent Parliament ; a thing he often\nblamed himfelf for fubfcribing unto, and\nas often thofe who importuned him there-\nunto. And therefore I wonder at that\npafiage of his (if it was his, which I\ndoubt of) in that book publifhed under\nV\n\fof King CHARLES L 187\nhis name, and called his PORTRAI-\nTURE, wherein he maintains this Par-\nliament was called as much by his own\nchoice and inclination, as advice of others :\nwhereas it is manifeftly known even unto\nall, it was only neceffity, and the impor-\ntunity of the Englifh, who would not\nfight with the Scots, and this only caufe\nwas it which gave occafion for calling of\nthis Parliament ; the Scots at prefent\nbeing pofleffed of Newcaftle. For the book\nitfelf, it maintains fo many contradidtions\nunto thofe things manifefted by his own\nletters, under his own hands, unto the\nQueen, that I conceive the raoft part of it\nApocrypha ; the Meditations or Pfalms\nwholly were added by others : fome loofe\npapers he had, I do well know, but they\nwere nothing fo well methodifed, but ra-\nther papers intended after for the prefs,\nor as it were a Memorial or Diary, than\nfuch a well couched piece, and to fo little\npurppfe. But it is anfwered by the\nlearned Milton. He was feldom in the\ntimes of war feen to be forrowful for\nthe flaughter of his people or foldiers,\nor indeed any thing elfe : whether by na-\nture or cuftom his heart was hardened,\nI leave for others to judge. When un-\nfortunately the Parliament had loft fome\nof their men in the weft, at Marlborough,\nand the Devizes, and they brought in 3\nmiferable\n\f1 83 On the Life and Death\nmiferable condition, without hofeorfhoes,\nor fcarce cloaths, into Oxford as a tri-\numph, he was content to be a fpeclator\nof their calamities, but gave neither order\nfor their relief, or commands for eafe of\ntheir fufferings ; nay, it was noted by fome\nthere prefent, he rejoiced in their fad af-\nfliction. So afterwards, when Hambden\nwas wounded, or near that time in Buck-\ninghamfhire, it happened a very valiant\nfoldier of the Parliament's fide to be\ntaken, fhipt ftark naked, his body being\nIhot in many places, and his fhoulder\nbroke : this poor foul in this condition\nand pickle, was fet on a poor lean jade,\nand brought as a triumph before the\nKing, where he ftood accompanied with\nmany Nobles. It would have pitied any\none's heart, to have heard how this poor\nman was reviled and upbraided by lewd\npeople, even as he paffed clofe by the\nKing's prefence ; who neither pitied the\nman, rebuked the unruly people, or gave\norder for cure of his wounds : but God\ncured the foldier inftantly, for he died\nere he was forty paces from the King's\nprefence ; and notwithstanding the mifery\nof the man, and fharpnefs of his wounds,\nyet was the greatnefs of his fpirit and\ncourage fo undaunted, that he rode very\nupright upon the poor jade, nothing\ndaunted either at his own prefent con-\ndition,\n\fof King CHARLES I. 189\ndition, or prefence of the King. It was\nobferved, that a lewd woman, as he pafled\nby, calling him Rebel, he only looked\nfternly at her, and faid, ' You whore\/\nSome Nobles feeing the hard-hearfednefs\nof the King upon this fad accident, and\nhow little he valued thofe who either\nfought for or againft him, upon this meer\noccafion deferted him, and came for Lon-\ndon, &c.\nEven the looks and geftures of Princes\nare obferved, you may fee, and feveral\neither good or ill conftruftions grounded\nthereon. He was obferved in his diet to\nfeed heartily, and would drink wines at\nmeals freely, but not in excels. He was\nrather violent than moderate in exer-\ncifes : when he walked on foot, he rather\ntrotted than paced, he went fo faft. He\nwas nothing at all given to luxury, was\nextream fober both in his food and ap-\nparel ; in the latter whereof he might\nrather be faid to go cleanly and neat,\nthen gaudy or riotoufly ; and as to the\nformer, he rather loved fober, full and\nfubftantial difhes, than kickfhaws, which\nthe extravagant Nobles feed for their\nwantonnefs fake; though many times, ere\nthey are fatisfied with curiofities in diet,\ntheir eftates lie pawned for them. In the\ngeneral he was not vicious -\ny and yet who\never lhall fay he was virtuous, extreamly\nerrs.\n\ftg6 On the Life and Death\nerrs. He was a medley betwixt virtue\nand vice. He was magnificent in fome\nmeafure, and was the only caufe of the\nbuilding that miracle of fhips called the\nRoyal Sovereign : and when fome of his\nNobles acquainted him with the vaft\ncharge thereof, he replied, '\nWhy fhould\n* not he be admitted to build that (hip\n* for his own pleafure, and which might\n* be upon occafion ufeful for fervice of\n* the kingdoms, as well as fome Nobles\n* prodigally fpent their patrimony in rio^\n* tous and ungodly courfes, nothing either\n* for their credits or reputations, or any\n* way beneficial to the kingdom ?' It was\nwifely faid of him at that time, * Every\n\u20ac\nman had his proper vanity, and that was\nc\nhis, if the people accounted it fo.' He\nwas ill thought of by many, efpecially the\nPuritans then fo called, for fufFering the\nchapel at Somerfet-Houfe to be built\nfor the Queen, where mafs was pub-\nlickly faid. Yet was he no Papift, or fa-\nvoured any of their tenets ; nor do I re-\nmember any fuch thing was ever objefted\nagainft him. Myfelf was once there to\ngaze, whilft the prieft was at high mafs\n:\nthe fexton and others thruft me out very\nuncivilly, for wr\nhich I protefted never to\ncome there again.\nThe aftions of Kings and Princes are\nlookt upon with many eyes, whereof fome\never\n\fof King CHARLES t igi\never prove either fquint or purblind. So\nlong as we live in this world, our con-\nveriation cannot be with faints, but with\nthe fons of Adam, who ever fmell of\nfome corruptions. Many alfo have blam-\ned him for writing unto the Pope when\nhe was in Spain : others think ill of him\nfor the many reprieves he gave unto femi-\nnary priefts -> and Mr. Pryn fweats to\npurpofe in aggravating his offenc^ there-\nby. Why he might not as well in a civil\nway write unto the Pope, as write and\nfend his Ambaffador to the great Turk,\nI know not : and for his mercy to thofe\npriefts, who had not occafioned rebellion\nin his dominions, truly charity bids me\nto make rather a good than ill conftruc-\ntion. And were not the common law of\nthis nation more in force than that canon\nof fcripture, thofe things could not be\njuftified, putting men to death for reli-\ngion, or taking orders beyond fea, &c.\nHe was ambitious, and difdained in his\nyouth to match with any of the Englifti\nladies ; and therefore, upon hopes of a\nmarriage with the prefent Kine of Spain's\nfifter, Monday the 27th of Feb. 1622.\nhe fet forward for Spain, went firft into\nFrance, and from thence with his high\nthoughts pafled the mountains. Neither\nhad he fuccefs in the marriage defired, or\ndid he get honour by that journey, al-\nthough\n\f192 On the Life and Death\nthough moft magnificently entertained in\nSpain. Some private difgufts happened\nthere and in that voyage, infomuch as he\nnever, after his return into England,\nmuch cared for the Spaniard; which he\nmade publickly known in feveral years of\nhis reign. He was accompanied to Spain\nwith the Duke of Buckingham, one\nwhom formerly he extreamly hated, but\nafter i- at journey as extreamly fancied,\nbeing his only great favourite. People\ngenerally were nothing fatisfied with that\nhis journey undertaken fo rafhly; yet\nmany fober men judged very well of the\nmarriage itfelf, and thefe did publickly\naver, the Spaniard was rich, and a brave\nman, would not be troublefome unto us\nwith unneceilary vifits, would ever bring\ngold in his pockets ; was a people, with\nwhom the Englifh merchants had a great\nand rich trade, and with whofe natural\nconditions the Englilh did pretty well\nfympathife ; and for the Infanta's ftrict-\nnets in the Roman religion, there was by\nmany prudent men very little question\nmade, that it would produce any ill to\nthis nation, which now had been Prote-\nftant above fixty years : and they did alio\nconfider that the Prince was very furely\ngrounded in his own Proteftant faith, and\nthat the common law would well provide\nfor the multiplicity of priefts, who might\nprefume\n\fof King CHARLES L 193\nprefume to come upon her account. The\n27th of March, being Sunday 1625, King\nJamefc died. All that whole year a moft\nfurious plague affli&ed the city of Lon-\ndon, there dying above fifty thoufand\npeople. Amongft thofe, whofe misfor-\ntune it was to abide in the city, during\nthat peftilent contagion, myfelf was one,\nand therein beheld God's great mercy\nunto me, being nothing at any time\nvifited, though my converfation was daily\nwith the infededi Arid I do well re-\nmember this accident, that going in July\n1625, about half an hour after fix in the\nmorning, to St, Antholine's Church, I\nmet only three perfons in the way* and\nno more, from my houfe over againft\nStrand-bridge, till I came there ; fo few\npeople were then alive, and the ftreets\nib unfrequented.\nIn June 1625, Mary, daughter of\nHenry the Fourth, King of France, came\nover, and was married to the King the\nfame month. Several conftruftions were\nmade upon this marriage with France,\nand many difputations in private were\nhad, whether fhe or the Infanta might\nhave been better for this nation. How-\never the Parliament, in regard of the\nficknefs, was tranflated to Oxford, Au-\nguft 1, 1625, anc* I2th \u00b0f the fame\ndiflblved. There are two main reafons\nO given\n\f194 0N the Life and Death\ngiven for its dilfolution : one was, be-\ncaufe the Duke of Buckingham his own\nfavourite, fhould not be queftioned con-\ncerning King James's death; and the\nfecond was, his Majefty made feveral\npropofitions unto the people, which they\nwould not confent unto. That King\nJames was really arid abfolutely poifoned\n\"by a plaifter, applied by Buckingham's\nmother unto King James's ftomach, was\nevidently proved before a Committee.\nBut whether Buckingham himfelf, or the\nlate King, was guilty either in the know-\nledge of, or application of the plaifter,\nI could never learn. Many feared the\nKing did know of it, and they gave this\nreafon ; becaufe, when the Parliament did\norder to queftion Buckingham for it, and\nhad prepared their charge or articles, to\nprefent againft him in the Houfe of\nLords, and to accufe him thereof, his\nMajefty, contrary to all expectation, and\nas an affront of both Houfes, and in the\nUpper Houfe, when the articles came\nup, gave Buckingham his hand to kifs,\ncarried him away with him, &c. This\naftion loft him the prefent Parliament's\naffections. Even the moft fober of his\nfriends held him very much jverfeen to\ndeny a Parliament juftice in any matter\nwhatfoever; but in matter of poifon,\nand the party poifoned being his father,\nin\n\fop King CHARLES L 195\nin that to prohibit a due courfe, or a legal\nproceeding againft the party fufpected, it\nwas to deny juftice with a refra&ory\nhand. But at that time he was lufty\nand young, and in his infancy of con-\nvening Parliaments, thought to make him*\nfelf fure ever after, or to mafter the\nCommons of England. There is no pen*\nhow able foever, can take off the blemifh\nthat will ever hang on him, for falling\nout with his Parliament, becaufe they\nqueftioned, how and by what means his\nfather came to his death.\nThe fecond of February 1625, he was\ncrowned at Weftminfter. William Laud\naltered the old coronation oath, and fram-\ned another new. And in March follow-\ning was a Parliament again fummoned,\nand therein Montague queftioned for Po-\npiili and Arminian tenets ; and Bucking-\nham was again alfo put to it by the Com-\nmons. In time of this Parliament he fent\nfor the Bifhops, and blamed their back-\nwardnefs, for that they did not inform\nhim, how he might promote the caufe\nof the church. Indeed, he did well\nknow what fawning Jacks moft of them\nwere, and how eafily he might with hope?\nof profit win them to his fide : they made\nup a good part of the Houfe of Lords in\nnumber. Here,again the Houfes of Par-\nliament were troubled with Buckingham\nO a and'\n\f196 On the Life and Death\nand Briftol, who was the vvifer man of\nthe two, but had leaft friends. Thefe\nframed bills, and accufed each other of\nfreafon. At that time moft men pitied\nBriftol, and thought him ill rewarded for\nall his fervice in Spain ; for it was con-\nceived he acted not but according to\ncommiffion. In this Parliament he com-\nmitted Sir Dudley Diggs, and Sir John\nElliot, Members of the Houfe of Com-\nmons, becaufe they moft rigoroufly had\nmanaged an accufation againft Bucking-\nham : An high affront it was to the Par-\nliament, and a great breach of privilege\nto commit a Member of that Houfe,\nv\/ithout the Houfe's confent : that matter\nwas much refented and very ill taken. By\nthofe and other his high mifcarriages unto\nboth Houfes, they began to miftruft him ;\nmany gave fad conjectures of his actions,\nand thought that in the end he would\neither have or lofe all. June 15, 1626,\nhe diffolves the Parliament, only becaufe\nthey (hould not profecute Buckingham.\nAn argument of found affection unto his\nfavourite, to hazard the love of millions\nonly for him ; but a deep imprudence and\nhigh overfight, to flight a whole nation\nfor love only of one man, and he but of\nyefterday ; or a new creature, of but his fa-\nther's ftamping, and his own continuing.\nIt was in Auguft this year, that Tilly\noverthrew his uncle the King of Den-\nmark\n\fof King CHARLES I. 197\nmark in a pitcht field. How the King\ncarried the bufinefs witli his uncle, or\nwhat treafure he promifed to fupply him\nwith, and did not perform, I know not.\nSure I am, the old King, after this fight,\ncould never endure our King, but Would\nfwear, he endeavoured what in him lay to\nmake him lofe his kingdom. This I had\nfrom the mouth of Dr. M. who heard the\nKing of Denmark fpeak what I write.\nIn Anno 1627, he fet forth men and\nfhips to the Ifle of Rhe in France, under\nthe conduct of Buckingham. We loft our\nbeft men in that fcurvy defign, who were\nno better than butchered by the French,\nthrough the indifcretion of fome that had\nprincipal command therein. But give\nme leave, before I proceed farther, to re-\nlate what I had from the mouth of an\neminent Colonel, employed in that fuc-\ncefslefs expedition, and one of the Coun-\ncil of War, and a fworn enemy to the\nDuke. Buckingham I well know was\nextremely blamed about the lofs of our\nmen, the day of their retreat unto the\nfhips. The matter was thus carried\n:\nThe night before the retreat, the Duke\ncalled a Council of War, and there fhewed\nthem the neceffity of their retreat the\nnext day, and th^t himfelf in martial\ndifcipline being wholly unexperienced, he\nleft the managing of the next day's action\nO j to\n\f198 On the Life and Death\nto the ordering of the Council of War,\noffering the fervice of his own perfon unto\nany hazard whatever as far as any private\nfoldier. The Council committed the ma-\nnagement of their retreat, by a free con-\nfent, unto old Sir William Courtney, a\nheavy dull covetous old man, who hav-\ning been twenty or thirty years a private\nCaptain in Holland, was, by Sir John\nBurrows's means, made Colonel in that\nexpedition. And Burrows being now\ndead, and Courtney the oldeft Colonel, it\nwas referred unto him how with fafety\nto bring off our men. But he, either\nthrough want of judgment, or forgetful-\nnefs, having not fufhciently provided for\niecurity of our rear, our men were moft\nunfortunately many of them cut in pieces :\nand had not Sir Pierce Crofby with eight\nhundred Irifh made good the retreat, all\nour men had been loft. Courtney him-\nfelf fell injo a falt-pan in the defeat, and\nwas faved by means of his man Anthony's\ncrying, < O f^ve my Captain :'\nbut the\npoor fellow loft his own life, and faved\nhis mafter's.\nA bullet by chance, during their ftay\nin that ifland, was fhot at the faid Court-\nney; and he having a piece of gold of\ntwenty one fhillings price in his fob, the\nbullet light there, bent the gold, and fa\nhe was preserved, Courtney, at his re-<\nturn*\n\fof King CHARLES I. 199\nturn, fhewed me the gold, and told me\nthe ftory. The King hearing of our\nlofs at the Ifle of Rhe, and landing of\nthe Duke, inftead of being angry at the\nlofs of fo many gallant men, or calling\nhim to account, lent to comfort the Duke,\ndeliring that he fhould not be troubled at\nthe lofs, for the chance of war was\nAnd now we are fpeaking of Rochelle,\nlet me acquaint the world, that his Ma-\njefty was the fole caufe of its loling, for\nhe lent the King of France eight or ten\nof his own navy, by which means the\nRochellers fhips were funk and deftroyed,\nwho before were ever able to relieve them-\nfelves with their own fhips, againit all\noppofition the Kings of France could\nmake. And that it may appear, he wil-\nlingly lent thefe ihips unto the French,\nand was not forced unto it by Buck-\ningham, as many have affirmed, I will\nrelate this pailage, perhaps not vulgarly\nknown. Sir John Pennington, being\nVice-Admiral, had commiffion to carry\neight or more royal fhips into France,\nWhen he arrived there, the French ac-\nquainted him the Ihips were to ferve the\nFrench King againft the Rochellers, and\nif that he the laid Sir John would ferve\nin that employment, he fhould be ho-\nnourably rewarded. But this gallant man\nO 4 being\n\ftoo On the Life and DeatHk\nbeing truly Englifh, fcorned the proffer,\nand utterly refufed the employment, and\nere he would refign the fhips unto the\nFrench, came privately hin^felf unto the\nKing, and informed the King of the\nFrench intentions againft Rochelle. But\nthe King faid only thus much :\n* Pen-\ni nington, go and deliver your fhips, and\n' leave them in France and then gave\nhim 3. particular or private warrant un-\nder his own h^nd for his difcharge, &c,\nHe had much ado to get his fhips again\nfrom the French, and then was enforced\nto fend Sir John Pennington amongft\nthe French, who feifed above a hundred\nFrench fhips, and kept them until ours were\ndelivered. One thing is obfervable, that\nwe had only two failors affifted againft\nRochelle in our fhips, and no more,\nThis I rdate in honour of the feamen.\nThe deftru&ion of Rochelle is wholly\nlaid upon our King's fcore, as well and\njjuftjy it may he, to his eternal difhonour\nand blemifh ; for had he not furnifhed\nthe French with fhips, Rochelle could not\nhave been taken as it was. And verily I\nbelieve, the fad groans and miferies of thofe\npoor Proteftants poured out unto Al-\nmighty God in their height of calamities\nagainft our King, were extreme inftru T\nmental in haftening down the anger of\nGqd againft the late King. However,\n\fof King CHARLES I. 201\nthis aftion of his loft him the love of\nthe Proteftant Princes in all parts of the\nworld, and his own fubje&s could after\nthat a&ion never well brook him, but\ndaily were alienated in their affe\u00a3i:on\nfrom him, fuppofing him either not well\ngrounded in the Proteftant Faith, or elfe\na meer ftate-juggler and no other. I know\nfome have accufed Buckingham to be in-\nftrumental about the lending thofe fhips :\n'tis poffible he was. However, in March\n1627, a Parliament was fummoned again,\nBuckingham articled againft, and in Junq\nprorogued until October ; after in March\ndiffolved, becaufe William Laud was re-\nmonftrated againft by the Commons, his\nruin laboured. There were alfo articles\nexhibited againft Buckingham in the Par-\nliament, but the latter of the two, vma\nBuckingham was ftabbed the 23d of\nAuguft 1628, he being ready to go unto\nfea for relief of Rochelie, then befieged.\nMany complained of the King in this his\nvarious aftion about Rochelie, viz. in firft\naiding the French to deftroy the P^ochel-\nlers fhips, then to take pajt with them\nagainft the King pf France; but to no\npurpofe. Some therefore compared him\nto a black witch, whom they lay can be-\nwitch and hurt cattle, but hath no ab lity\nto cure them again. It was an a6t of\ngreat inconftancy, and much diflionour\nto\n\f202 On the Life and Death\nto himfelf and whole nation, though the\nnation had no hand in it. When firft\nthe news was brought unto the King of\nBuckingham's death, he was at a fermon,\nor in a church, or at fervice. He did not\nfeem much troubled at the news, but\nftayed out the fermon with much pati-\nence, only gave Maxwell prefent direc-\ntions to feize the Duke's cabinet, where-\nin his letters and private inftruftions were.\nAll men generally, except a few court\nparafites, were glad of Buckingham's\ndeath : yet nothing was bettered in the\ncourt or commonwealth after his death\n;\nwhich moved many to affirm, that all the\nmifgovernments in the realm proceeded\nnot from Buckingham's ill advice, but\nmoft from the corrupt and depraved na-\nture of the King's own hafte. Sith I\nam upon the death of Buckingham, I\nfhall relate a true ftory of his being ad-\nmonifhed often of the manner of his death\nhe fhould die, is this manner.\nAn aged gentleman, one Parker, as I\nremember, having formerly belonged un-\nto the Duke, or of great acquaintance\nwith the Duke's father, and now retired,\nhad a daemon appeared feveral times unto\nhim, in the fliape or image of Sir George\nVilliers the Duke's Father. This daemon\nwalked many times in Parker's bed cham-\nber, without any a\u00a3tiou of terror, noife,\n\fop King CHARLES I. 203\nhurt, or fpeech but at laft one night\nbroke out into thefe words :\n* Mr. Parker,\n* I know you loved me formerly, and my\n\\ fon George at this time very well : I\n\u00ab would have you go from me, you know\n* me very well to be his father, old Sir\n\\\nGeorge Villiers of Leicefterfhire, and\n\\ from me acquaint him with thefe and\n* thefe particulars, &c. and that he above\n* all refrain the counfel and company of\n* fuch and fuch\/ whom he then nominated,\n< or elfe he will come to deftruction, and\n* that fuddenly.' Parker did partly,\nthough a very difcreet man, imagine he\nhimfelf was in a dream all this time,\nand being unwilling to proceed upon no\nbetter grounds, forbare addrefling himfelf\nto the Duke ; for he conceived, if he fhould\nacquaint the Duke with the words of his\nfather, and the manner of his appear-*\nance unto him, (fuch apparitions being\nnot ufual) that he fhould be laughed at,\nand thought to dote, being he was aged,\ngome few nights pafTed without further\ntrouble to the old man. But not very\nmany nights after, old Sir George Villiers\nappeared again, walked quick and furi-\noully in the room, feemed angry with\nMr. Parker, and at laft faid, ' Mr. Parker,\n1 I thought you had been my friend fo\n< much, and loved my fon George fq\n5 well* that you would have acquainted\nf\nhim\n\f204 THE Life and Death\n* him with what I defired, but yet I\n\u00ab know that you have not done it. By\n* all the friendfliip that ever was betwixt\ni you and me, and the great refpeft you\n1\nbear my fon, I defire you to deliver what\n* I formerly commanded you unto my\nf\nfon.' The old man, feeing himfelf thus\nfolicited in this manner, promifed the dae-\nmon he would; but firft argued it thus :\nThat the Duke was not eafy to be fpoke\nwithal, and that he would account him\na vain man to come with fuch a meffage\nfrom the dead ; nor did he conceive the\nDuke would give any credit unto him.\nWhereunto the daemon thus anfwered;\n' If he will not believe you have this dif-\nc\ncourfe from me, tell him of fuch a\n* fecret,' and named it,\n1\nwhich he knows\nc\nnone in the world ever knew but my-\n* felf and he\/ Mr. Parker being now\nwell fatisfied, that he was not afleep, or\nthat the apparition was a vain delufion,\ntook a fit opportunity therefore, and feri-\noully acquainted the Puke with his fa-\nther's words, and the manner of his ap-\nparition. The Duke heartily laughed at\nthe relation, which put old Parker to a\nftand : but at laft he afiumed courage,\nand told the Duke, that he acquainted\nhis father's ghoft with what he now found\nto be true, viz. fcorn and derifion :\n* But\nf\nmy Lord\/ faith he, * your father bad\n1\nm\n\fof King CHARLES I. 205\n%\nme acquaint you by this token, and he\n* faid it was fuch as none in the world\n* but your two felves did yet know\/\nHereat the Duke was amazed and much\naftonifhed ; but took no warning or no-\ntice thereof, keeping the fame company\nftill, advifing with fuch counfellors, and\nperforming fuch aftions, as his father by\nParker countermanded. Shortly after,\nold Sir George Villiers, in a very quiet\nbut forrowful pofture, appears again un-\nto Mr. Parker and faid, * Mr. Parker, I\n* know you delivered my words unto\n5 George my fon ; I thank you for fo\n1\ndoing : but he flighted them ; and now\n4\nI only requeft this more at your hands,\n* that once again you repair unto my fon,\n* and tell him, if he will not amend, and\n4\nfollow the counfel I have given him,\n* this knife or dagger,' and with that he\npulled a knife or dagger from under\nhis gown, * fhall end him ; and do you\n* Mr. Parker fet your houfe in order, for\nf you fhall die at fuch a time\/ Mr. Par-\nker once more engaged, though very un-\nwillingly, to acquaint the Duke with\nthis laft meflage, and fo did ^ but the\nDuke defired him to trouble him no fur-\nther with fuch mefiages and dreams : told\nhim, he perceived he was now an old\nman, and doted. And within a month\nafter meeting Mr. Parker on Lambeth-\nBridge,\n\f2o6 On the Life and Death\nBridge, \u00ab Now, Mr. Parker, v\/hat fay yotl\n1\nof your dream ?' Who only returned,\n* Sir, I wifh it may never have fuccefs\/\n&c. But within fix weeks after, he was\nftabbed with a knife, according to his\nfather's admonition before-hand -\ny and Mr.\nParker died foon after he had feen the\ndream or vifion performed.\nThe 2.9th of May, 1630, being Satur-\nday, near unto one in the afternoon, the\npreient King of Scotland was born. The\nnext day the King came to Pauls-Crofs;\nto give God thanks for the birth of his\nfon, where were prefented unto him thefe\nverfes\n:\nRex ubi Paulinias accefllt gratus ad aras,\nImmicuit medio lucida ftefla polo.\nDie divina mihi traclans aenigmata coeli,\nHaee oriens nobis, quid fibi ftella velit ?\nMagnus in occiduo princeps modo nafcitur orbe^\nMoxque fub eclipfi regna orientis erunt.\nAbout May, 1633, he went into Scot-\nland, and was crowned there the 18th of\nJune, 0 in 7\n0\nD in 7\n0\n. r. In July\nhe had a dangerous paflage from Brunt-\nIfland, and hardly efcaped drowning.\nSome of his houfhold-ftuff or plate was\nloft.\nIn 1634, he was infinitely troubled with\nfaftion in his court, which much difpleaf*\ned him; but by little and little he put\nall things in order again. Then alfo he\nlevied\n\fof King CHARLES R 207\nlevied a general great tax upon the whole\nkingdom, vulgarly called Ship-money,\nbecaufe it was pretended, it was for\nmaintenance of the navy : and truly much\nof it was that way expended, and the\nfailors well paid their wages ; which oc-\ncafioned for two years together a good\nfleet of royal fhips to be fet forth, much\nfor the honour of the nation.\nThis fhip-money was generally miflik-\ned, being a mere innovation, and a cleanly\ntrick to poll the fubjecls, and cheat them\ninto an annual payment. Myfelf was\nthen a collector for it in the place I lived\nin. I remember my proportion was twen-\nty two fhillings, and no more. If we\ncompare the times then, and the prefait\nin which I now live, you fhall fee great\ndifference even in afFeffinents, the necef-\nfity of maintaining our armies requiring\nit : for now my annual payments to the\nfoldiery are very near or more than twenty\npounds, my eftate being no way greater\nthan formerly. Againft this Ihip-money\nmany gallant men oppofed, and at laft in\nParliament it was voted down.\nIn July 1637, viz. 23d day, there\nwas great difturbance in Edinburgh, about\na new Service-Book endeavoured to be\nobtruded on the Scots by the King and\nCanterbury. I have heard, an old wo-\nman begun the quarrel by calling her\nftool\n\f2o3 On the Life And D\u00a3ath\nftool at the prieft, when he read thfc\nService-Book. Many very modeft divines\nexceedingly blame both the King and\nCanterbury far that bdok ; it admitted\nunto the people, as I remember, the\nCommunion but in one kind. However,\nby the prudence of feme grave men, be-\ning then Privy-Counfellors in Scotland,\nmatters were Rubbered over all that win-\nter in Scotland ; but in May, or April*\nnew tumults arofe, and truly I may almoft\nfay, that that corrupt Common-Prayer-^\nBook was the fole and whole occafion of\nall the miferies and wars that fince that\ntime have happened in both nations.\nHad his Majefty firft endeavoured the\nimpofition of that lame book upon ths\nEnglifh, moft men did believe we had\nfwallowed it, and then the Scots muft\nhave done it afterwards ; for the clergy\nat that time generally were fuch idle\nand lazy lubbers, and fo pampered with\ncourt preferment, and places temporal in\nevery lhire of England, and fuch flat-\ntering fycophants, that doubtlefs the\ngreat hand of God was in it, that thofe\nrude Scots firft broke the ice, and taught\nus the way to expel an infulting prieft-\nhood, and to refift the King ; he endea-\nvouring by unwarrantable means to in-\ntrude things contrary to the divine law of\nAlmighty God upon our confeiences.\n\fof King CHARLES I. 2Q9\nIn Anno 1638, the Queen- mother of\nFrance, and mother unto the Englifh\nQueen, widow of Henry the fourth,\nKing of France, landed in England, and\ncame unto London the 31ft of October.\nShe was very meanly accompanied, and\nfew of quality attending her. The King\nmoft humanely and generoufly receives and\nentertains her, though all men were ex-\ntremely againft it 5 for it was obferved,\nthat wherever, or unto what country\nthis miferable old Queen came, there fol-\nlowed immediately after her either the\nplague, war, famine, or one misfortune\nor other. Strange it is unto me, how fhe\ncould be fo fatal to any land fhe entred\ninto* True it is, and I do very well\nknow> that fome people born under an\nunfortunate conftellation of heaven (with-\nout this, that they live above nature, and\nlive wholly in the fpirit) are fo extreme\nunfuccefsful in every thing they under-\ntake, that let them ufe the greateft in-\nduftry they can to be rich* all will not\namount to obtain a poor living, though\nthey are affifted not only with a good\nftock of money to begin their profefhon\nwith, but have alfo many very profitable\nand affifting friends, and means for their\nbetter encouragement and furtherance.\nIt is very poUible, that fuch like ill for-\n2 tune from her infancy might attend this\nP ~ old\n\f210 On the Life and Death\nold Queen, as to be thought an unlucky\nprefage of what mifchief prefently fol-\nlowed her in thofe countries flie refided\nin.\nin November, proclamation was made\nto diffolve the great affembly in Scotland,\nbut to little purpofe ; for the Scots have\nthis privilege belonging unto them, that\nwhere, and when they pleafe, to obey no\nedicts or commands of their Kings, ex-\ncept thofe edifts fancy their own humours.\nThis proclamation was laughed at, and\nflighted by the Scots, who made it appear\nthey were in good earneft, and began to\nraife an army for their own defence, by\nno means enduring the half Popifti Com-\nmon-Prayer-Book. This raifing of an\narmy by the Scots, in oppofition of the\nCommon-Prayer- Book, made our pre-\nlates prick up their ears, and the lazy\nbifhops moft of all, who convened, and\nraifed amongft their own Levitical Tribe\ngreat fums of money towards the main-\ntenance* of an army againft the Scots,\nwhom they now hated worfe than Turks.\nSeveral particular men are fummoned to\nappear at court, are enforced to lend vaft\nfums of money towards the maintenance\nof an army. I have heard fome affirm,\nthe King had in his coffers at that time\nabove fix hundred thoufand pounds : No\ngreat\n\fof King CHARLES I. 2x1\ngreat fum for fo provident a prince, and\nfuch large incomes as he had.\nIn or about the 27th of March. 1639,\nthe King fet forward towards Scotland.\nHis army followed immediately : the Earl\nof Arundel being made general, a man\nof great nobility, courage, and refolu-\ntion, and one whofe anceftors had been\ngenerals feveral times againft the Scots\nwith excellent fuccefs. There attended\nthe King in this expedition moft of the\nnobility of this nation, but with great\nunwillingnefs ; for the Englifh and Scots\nhaving now lived like brethren, or na-\ntives, or people of one nation, one a-\nmongft another for almoft forty years>\nand having intermarried one with ano-\nther, both the nobility or gentry, and\nothers, they thought it a very ftrange\nthing, and not lawful of convenient, that\nthis nation fhould now take up arms,\nand engage againft the Scots, only to\nfatisfy the infatiable luft of a few domi-\nneering priefts, and half popifh biihops\n;\nas alfo of an obftinate King, wholly led\nby the nofe by thefe fnaffiing Priefts.\nThe common foldier was nothing well\npleafed, and marched moft unwillingly\nupon this fervice. At laft both armies,\nfor many days, accofted each other ; yet\nI never heard of fo much as one loufe\nkilled by either army; the Scots being\nP 2 very\n\f212 On the Life and Death\nvery tender of provoking the Englifh, and\nthey as willing to give no offence unto\nthe Scots. In June of that year a peace\nwas concluded betwixt both nations, the\nEnglilh nobility much defiling and fur-\nthering it.\nThe King himfelf was mofl greedy\nabove all men of this union with the\nScots, as will appear by this enfuing\nftory. That day which was affigned for\ncertain of the Englifh nobility and Scot-\nifli to treat about thofe articles of agree-\nment or pacification the Scotifh nobility\nwere to produce ; the nobles of each na-\ntion being fet, the Earl of Arundel be-\ngan with much gravity to rebuke the\nScots for their unadvifednefs and rebel-\nlion in raifing their army againft their\nlawful King, and difturbing the peace of\nboth nations ; and yet he commended\nthe good nature of the King, who was,\nnotwithftanding their high provocations\nand mifdemeanors, veiy inclinable to hear\ntheir juft grievances, and to that purpofe\n.had appointed himfelf, being General of\nthe Englifh army, and fbme other fele\u00a3t\nnobles of his council, to meet them that\nday, to treat with them, and to hear\ntheir grievances, and what they could fay\nfor themfelves. This gallant man was\nproceeding further in his fpeech, and ag-\ngravating the Scots offences, when, lo,\nz unex-\n\fof King CHARLES I. 213\nunexpectedly his Majefty entered the\nroom, called for the articles the Scots\ndefired to he ratified, or confented unto,\nread them fcarce over, but took pen and\nink immediately, and figned them, with-\nout ever advifing with any of his coun-\ncil j which fo difpleafed the nobility of\nthe Engliflh nation, that the very next\nday after figning the Scots articles, they\nall halted- home to their own habitations\n;\nthe King flaying behind, and for his\ndaily exercife, played at a fcurvy game\ncalled pigeon-holes, or nine-pins. His\nfellow gamefters alfo were equal to the\ngame, viz. lackeys, pages, and fuch\nothers, ejufdem generis. He again no\nfooner came to London, but as I remem-\nber, caufed thpfe articles to be burned by\nthe common hangman; making himfelf\na? ridiculous in doing the one, as he was\nreputed weak and fimple of judgment in\ndoing the other. But at that time moft\nimputed the burning of the Scots articles,\nunto the advices given him, and importu-\nnity of the proud clergy and bifhops, vyho\nhumoured him in every itcjiing defire pf\nhjs, even to his ruin.\nThere happened many memorable ac-\ncidents in this year 1639 ; as firft, five\neclipfes of the fun and moon ; three of\nJhe fun, twp of the moon 5 none was\nP 3 vifible\n\f214 OiN THE Life and Death\nvifible in our horizon, but the eclipfe of\nthe fun, which here began with us at\nLondon the 2 2d of May, being Wednef-\nday, at 3 hours and 52 minutes after\nnoon ; its middle was at 4 hours and 52\nminutes, and its end at 46 minutes af-\nter 5. The digits eclipfed were 8. 51 mi-\nnutes, 41 feconds; the whole time of its\ncontinuance was 1 hour, and 54 mi-\nnutes of time : The icheme of heaven\nfollows.\ni\n6V.

J2.P.M.\nHis Majefty was in the field againft\nthe Scots at the very time of the eclipfe\n;\nand fome that were there with him faid,\n\u00ab They\n\fof King CHARLES I. 215\n* They felt not a more fharp cold day in\n* all their lives than that was, the feafon\n* of the year, and height of the fun con-\n* fidered. Til meddle little with the prog-\nnoftick part of this eclipfe : yet I might\ntell you, that Mercury, at the time of\nthe beginning of the eclipfe, reprefented\nthe clergy, and he was retrograde near to\nconjunftion with Mars : one ill omen unto\nthe clergy. At the middle of the eclipfe\nthe moon was their fignificator, and fhe\neombuft and near the dragon's-tail, which\nfignified much calamity unto the priefts,\nThis eclipfe fignified unto the King much\ntreachery and damage by his friends the\nScots ; the degree eciipfed was in the op-\npofite degree, almoft, of the fun in his\nradix. As this eclipfe fhewed his troubles,\nor their beginning; fo the moon's eclipfe\nin 8 \/ in 1648, ended his afflictions,\n&c.\nThe elFefts of this eclipfe had moft in-\nfluence upon the King of Spain, it falling\neven in the very degree of the feventh\nhoufe ; fo that upon the 1 ith or 12th of\nOctober 1639, upon our Engiifh coaft,\nand under our nofes, almoft in our har-\nbour, the Hollander burnt and funk a\ngreat navy of his, with many miferable\nfouls in the navy, which were to be land-\ned in Flanders. I know fome have not\nftuck to affirm, that the eight thoufand\n\u2022\nP 4 men,\n\f216 On the Life and Death\nmen, tranfported iji the Spanifh navy,\nwere intended to have been landed here in\naffiftance of hi5 Majefty : but it was a\nmeer untruth ; for who could have hin-\ndered their landing in Kent, if his Ma-\njefty had commanded it ? Sure I am, the\nSpaniard took it ill at his Majefty's hand,\nthat he fuffered them to perifh fo near\nour harbour. They alfo took exception,\nthat his Majefty having promifed them\nammunition and powder, which it feems\nthey wanted, it came not at the place for\nthem, either by neglect or treachery of\nour officers, until they were worfted. The\ntruth of the ftory of thefe eight thou-\nfand Spaniards in the navy was thus.\nThere was a part of that country where\nthe Walloons inhabit, under the domi-\nnion of the King of Spain, in the Ne-\ntherlands, which was taken notice to be\nvery difaffefted unto him : now upon\nlanding thefe amongft the Walloons, fo\nmany of that people were to have been\ntranfported into Spain, &c. When his\nMajefty firft heard of the Spanifh. and\nDutch fleet, and their near approach, he\nfaid to one {landing by him, * I would I\n* were well rid of both navies\/ To fpeak\nthe truth of him, either as he was virtuous\nor vicious, is not to wrong him but in\nevery trivial mifcarriage to make him the\nauthor\n\fof King CHARLES I, 217\nauthol of it, I hold it barbarous, and not\nthe part of an honeft moral man.\nIn this memorable year, the Scots, by\naft amongft themfelves, thruft out all\nbifhops ; who after came fneaking hither,\nand had by Canterbury's means large and\nplentiful exhibitions for their mainte-\nnance. His Majefty took the expulfion\nof the bifhops fo ill, as that he refolved\nto check the faucinefs of the Scots, his\ndear countrymen, and caufed their trade\nwith us to be prohibited, and their fhips\nto be feifed ; which fo enraged the Scotifh\nnation, that they were again in 1640 in\narms. The King fummons a Parliament\nin April about the Scots, which Parlia-\nment would not give a farthing unto\nhim towards maintenance of his intended\narmy againfl: the Scots therefore in May\nhe diflblves the Parliament ; which gave\ngreat difcontent all over the nation, and\ngreat encouragement unto the Scots\n:\nwhereupon their army was fuddenly rea-\ndy, and their prefumption fuch, as with-\nout invitation, they, the 17th of Auguft\n1640, entred England. The King pre-\npares an army of Englifh to refift them :\nbut fuch was the general inclination even\nof the common foldiers, and fo great an\nodium or hatred was caft upon William\nLaud, Archbifhop of Canterbury, that\nnothing would ferve the common foldiers\nbut\n\f2i8 On the Life and Death\nbut a Parliament ; not a man of the\nEnglifh would fight againft the Scots,\nwho were now crept into the ftrong town\nof Newcaftle : our foldiers were mutinous,\nthe officers generally difaffected to the\nfervice : in fome countries the new raifed\nfoldiers flew their officers, and would not\ngo. All thefe commotions moved the\nKing little to defift from the war, being\ncontinually furthered by the bifhops and\nclergy, who in their convocation gave a\nlarge benevolence towards the mainte^\nnance of thofe wars, and commanded\ntheir tribes in their feveral pulpits to in^\nveigh, and cry aloud againft the profane\nScots, and to perfuade the people to aflift\nas willingly as againft Infidels or Turks.\nHis Majefty again commanded the nobili-\nty to attend him in this Northern expe-\ndition, who leifurely, and rather unfea-*\nfonably or unwillingly, than otherways,\nattended him at York.\nAll men knew this war was promoted\nby the clergy, whom the nobility began\nto difdain and fcorn, and the gentry and\nyeomanry of England extreamly to hate\n;\nfor at this prelent time the high com-\nmiffion-court, and other bawdy courts,\ndid moft horrible injuftice againft the\nperfons and eftates of any gentleman,\nwho by misfortune came thither. There\nwas alio one Wrenn, bifhop of Norwich,\n\fof King CHARLES I. 219\nborn in London, a fellow whofe father\nfold babies and fuch pedlary ware in\nCheapfide. This fellow very peremptorily\none day, as he fat in Judicature in the\nHigh Commiffion-Court, faid openly,\n* He hoped to live to fee the time, when\n6\na Mafter of Arts, or a minifter, Ihould\n< be as good a man as any Jack gentle-\nf man in England.' And verily the pride\nof this faucy citizen's fon, hath been one\nmain \u00a3aufe of the ruin of the clergy.\nConcerning this Wrenn, I know Canter-\nbury preferred him, and brought him to\nthofe Ecclefiaftical advancements in court\nand church, which he enjoyed. I do alfo\nknow, and have heard it from fome who\nwaited on Canterbury in his chamber,\nthat he would oft fay, that the rafh ac-\ntions and unwarrantable proceedings of\nthis Wrenn would undo the clergy ; but\nin regard he had been the fole means of\nhis advancement, he could not well do\nany aft prejudicial againft him, but it\nwould redound to the difhonour of him-\nfelf, and the clergy in general : alfo he\nhad many reluftancies in himfelf, for\npreferring fo unworthy a fcornful fellow,\nwho proved the fcandal and fcorn of\nchurchmen, and an extraordinary plague\nto the whole nation. For upon his\nplaguing and punifhing many godly\nclothiers in the countries of Norfolk and\nSuffolk,\n\f220 On the Life; and Death\nSuffolk, they were forced to leave their\nnative country, and betake themfelves and\nfamilies into the United Provinces, where\nthey have taught the Dutch the art and\nmanfa\u00a3ture of cloathing, even to the ut-\nter impoverifhment of this whole nation,\n&c. and yet this wretched Wrenn lives,\n&c.\nAs I remember, near upon, or in this\nyear 1639, or 1640, the citizens of Lon-\ndon were miferably abufed by a beggarly\nKnight, one Sir Phillips of Ireland, who\nexhibited his bill againft them, for cer-\ntain mifdemeanors pretended to be com-\nmitted by fome of their fub-officers in\nIreland, about the parts of London-Derry.\nTrue it is, the citizens of London very\ngallantly, about the coming in of King\nJames, or not long after, fent colonies of\ntheir own in great numbers, and at their\nown extreme great charges, to fettle a\ncivil plantation in the North of Ireland.\nThey had a large patent from King James,\nand many privileges granted unto them\nfor their fo doing and planting. Above\nthirty years they had quietly poflefled their\nown lands there, had built many beauti-\nful market-towns, one or more city or\ncities, many churches in the territories\nafligned them. But near thefe years of\n1639, or 1640, this Sir Phillips demand-\ning fome unreafonable things of the citi-\nzens,\n\fof King CHARLES L 221\nZens, and being denied them, he in ma-\nlice exhibits his bill for mifdemeanors of\ntheir officers, againfl: the Londoners in\nthe Star-chamber ; brought the caufe unto\na hearing; the court of Star-chamber fined\nthe Londoners deeply, adjudged their plan-\ntations forfeited to the King, who as ea-\ngerly and greedily fwallowed them for his\nown. This very acl: in or near this exi-\ngence of time, fo imbittered the fpirits of\nthe citizens, that although they were\nfingularly invited for loan of monies, and\nhad as great plenty in their pofleffions as\never, yet would not contribute any af-\nfiftance or money againft the Scots, or\nadvance of his Majefty in this his Scotifh\nexpedition. And though I do not at-\ntribute thefe cafualties and lolTes of the\ncities, to be derived or caufed from the\neclipfe of 1639, although the eclipfe was\nin Gemini, which fign is the afcendant\nof London : yet certainly, that Eclipfe\ndid in a natural way threaten or portend\nmuch damage unto them, and did mani-\nfeft the cafualties, but was not the caufe.\nThere was at laft a ceffation of arms\nby confent of both parties, Scots and\nEnglifh. Some petty fcuffling there was\nto no purpofe. The King, when he faw\nno other means could be thought on for\nto ferve his turn, and that the common\nfoldier unanimoufly refufed engaging with\nthe\n\f\u00a322 On the Life and Death\nthe Scots, by the conftant and earnefi\ndefire of the Englifh nobility, which at-\ntended him, he with much unwillingnefs\nat length was content to give fummons\nfor another Parliament to be convened\nthe third day of November 1640. But\nyou mull underftand in the mean while,\nwhen the King faw he could no ways\nengage the Englifh againft the Scots, he\nhad fent unto Ireland for the then pre-\nfent Lord Deputy, the Earl of Strafford,\nformerly Sir Thomas Wentworth, a York-\nfhire gentleman by birth, and one who\nhad formerly been a great ftickler againft\nhim, until, poifoned with court-prefer-\nment, he turned Royalift, and fo was\nmade Lord Deputy of Ireland ; a man of\nthe rareft parts and deepeft judgment of\nany Englifhman living ; I fay, he fent\nfor this Strafford to confult with him\nabout compofmg thefe emergent differ-\nences. Strafford advifes with Canterbury,\nall to little purpofe ; for the Bifhop was\na very afs in any thing but church-mat-\nters ; the hand of providence now going\nalong with the Parliament and common-\nwealth, who became mafters of all pub-\nlick fpirited people, the King daily de-\nclining. In April 1641, the Parliament\naccufe Strafford for feveral mifdemeanors,\ntreafons, tyrannies, &c. againft the com-\nmonwealth, during his government in\nIreland.\n\fof King CHARLES L 223\nIreland. The Parliament follow it fo\nluftily, that notwithftanding Strafford\nfpoke and defended himfelf as well as\nany mortal man in the world could do,\nyet. he was found guilty, had his fentence\nto die, and did die. Thomas Earl of\nArundel being Lord High Steward, the\nKing figned the warrant for his death,\neither by himfelf or Commiffioners. Thus\ndied Strafford, the wifeft politician this\nnation ever bred.\nAll men accufe the King for his falfe-\nnefs and cowardice unto this man, who\nbeing fatisfied in his own confcience, that\nStrafford was not guilty of treafon or\ndeath, but only of mifdemeanors, yet\nligned a warrant, either under his own\nhand, or by commiffioners. Some there\nare who do fay, with the fame pen, and\nat the fame time, he figned the warrant\nagainft Strafford, and alfo the Act for a\ntriennial or perpetual Parliament, which\nIhould not be diffolved without confent\nof both Houfes. Many affirm, the Queen\nprocured him to do both thefe things\n:\nothers impute it to Hamilton. It mat-\nters not who did it, or perfuaded him, it\nwas his ruin, &c.\nThe matter is not great, who invited\nthe Scots into England: fome thought\nPirn, Hambden, and feveral other gen-\ntlemen were inftrumentaL It is very like\nit\n\f224 On the Life and Death\nit was true, and that the King kneiv\nas much, but could not remedy it. The\nParliament however in policy and judg-\nment gave the Scots a round fum of\nmoney for their lofies, and ordered them\nto depart this kingdom, which they did\n;\nfo that in Auguft 1641, the King went\ninto Scotland purpofely to pacify and com-\npofe the prefent threatening differences\nthere.\nIn the fame month of Auguft 1641, I\nbeheld the old Queen-Mother of France\ndeparting from London, in company of\nThomas Earl of Arundel. A fad fpec-\ntacle of mortality it was, and produced\ntears from mine eyes, and many other\nbeholders, to fee an aged, lean, deCrepid,\npoor Queen, ready for her grave* necef-\niitated to depart hence, having no place\nof refidence in this world left her, but\nwhere the courtefy of her hard fortune\naffigned it. She had been the only ftately\nand magnificent woman of Europe ; wife\nto the greateft King ever lived in France,\nmother unto one King and unto two\nQueens. The King cared not much for\nthe Eal*l of Arundel, bdng he was of\na fevere and grave nature, could not en-\ndure court-novelties or flatterers, was\npotent in allies, &c. But there was one\nthing or caufe mainly above the reft, and\nthat was, becaufe the Earl of Arundel\nbeing\n\fof King CHARLES I. 225\nbeing Lord High Steward and Judge in\nStrafford's trial, gave his voice that he\nwas guilty of treafon, &c. The Earl\nalfo had but a few years before given the\nKing a touch of his own great heart, and\nthe King's unthankfulnefs unto him and\nhis family. The cafe was thus : A prieft\npretends the King had a right in a\nreftory : the Earl challenged for his, and\nhad procured Canterbury for his friend\nand fecond. The matter had many de-\nbates : for Arundel wr\nas no fool, but flood\nftoutly for his right. Canterbury was as\nviolent for the prieft, and had procured\nthe King to take cognizance, or hear the\nmatter. The King upon fome flight\nevidence maintained it was his, viz. be-\nlonged to the Crown. The Earl feeing\nthe obftinatenefs of the King, and his\nfiding with a petty prieft againft him, and\nhis proper right, out of the greatnefs of\nhis heart, faid, * Sir, this reftory was\n* an appendant unto fuch or fuch a\n* manor of mine, until my grandfather,\n* unfortunately, loft both his life and\n* feventeen Lordfhips more, for the love\n* he bore to your grandmother\/ This\nwas a fmart fpeech, and home to pur-\npofe: it fo aftonifhed the King, that he\nreplied pretty mildly, * My Lord, I would\n* not have you to think that fo poor a\n' thing as this reftory or thing in queftion\n\"\n' (hall\n\f226 On the Life And Death\n* fhall ftand in competition betwixt my\n* refpect unto you and your family, which\n*\nI know to be deferving,' &c. After\nthat time the Earl little liked the King's\naftions, and therefore took this opportune\noccafion of going away with the Queen-\nmother: and when one faid unto him,\nhis Majefty would mifs him ; *\nIt is an\n* ill dog\/ faid the Earl, ' that is not worth\n* whittling and though he is a King, he\n\u20ac\nwill find Arundel's affe&ion unto him\n* would not have been inconfiderable\/\n&c. Some few years fince, this Earl died\nat Padua, being the laft man of the\nEnglifh nation, that maintained the gra-\nvity and port of the ancient nobility; a\ngreat lover of antiquities, and of the\nEnglifh nation. He brought over the\nnew way of building with brick in the\ncity, greatly to the fafety of the city, and\nprefervation of the wood of this nation.\nHe was a great patron of decayed gentry ;\nand being Lord High Marfhal of Eng-\nland, carried too ftrift an hand againft\nthe yeomanry and commonalty ; for which\nhe was nothing beloved, but rather hated\nof them. However, the gentry and no-\nbility owe much unto his memory.\nIn Oftober 1641, the Irifh unanimoufly\nrebel and mafiacre the poor Englifh, who\nwere not able to relieve themfelves, as\nmatters at prefent were handled, wanting\nable\n\fof King CHARLES I. 227\nable governors to direft them. And the\nvery truth is, the way which at firft was\ntak\u00a3n to fupprefs the rebellion, did only\nfupport it : for confidence being given to\nfortie of the Irifh nobility, and many of\nthem furnifhed with arms, they furnifh\ntheir own kindred, being native Irifh;\nwho were no fooner poffefTed of arms,\nbut they became errant traitors to the\nEnglifh. A great queftion will here arife,\nwhether the murder of the Englifh was\n5\nby confent or commiffion from the King\nunto the Irifh ? Many have affirmed in\nwords and in print publickly, that he\nfhould be guilty of fuch a villanous aft\n;\nwhich I cannot believe, in regard I could\nnever have any allured relation, what thofe\ncommiffions were the Irifh boafted of,\nthey being only the affirmations of the\nCatholick Irifh, purpofely to win others\nunto their party, and feducing many by\nfaying, they afted by the King's commif-\nfions. Had this been true, it had been\nmore than equal unt) his affifting for\ndeftruftion of Rochelle ; but I may hope\nbetter things, both as he was a Pro-\nteftant, a Chriftian, aid a King. Yet\nmethink there is little fatisfaftion given\nunto this in his late pretended book.\nTwo main things are objected againft the\nKing, which that book meddles not with,\nor anfwers. Firft, why his Majefty was\nQ^2 fo\n\f%\n228 On the Life and Death\nfo tender-hearted 6f the Irifh, as not to\nfuffer above forty proclamations to iflue\nont againft thofe rebels in Ireland, and\nthofe alfo to no purpofe, or unoppor-\ntunely, when too late. Befides, to fhew\nhis refpeft unto them, I know he obli-\nterated with his own hands the word\nIrifh rebels, and put in Irifh fubje&s, in\na manufcript difcourfe, writ by Sir Ed-\nward Walker, and prefented unto him,\nwhich I have feen of the Irifh rebellion,\n&c. Secondly, whereas the Parliament\nwere fending over cloaths, and other ne-\nceffaries, for the Englifh. foldiers in Ire-\nland, the King feized them as they went,\narmed and furnifhed the Englifh and Welfh\nagainft the Parliament. The reafons of\nthefe are omitted by the penner of his Por-\ntraiture.\nIn November 1641, the Parliament\nftill fitting, the King comes for London,\nis entertained by them in the greateft ftate\nmight be, and met on the way by fome\nhundreds in gold chains ; and nothing is\nnow cried but '\nHolanna, welcome home >\n* your Majefty is welcome.' The Queen\nperceiving a breach was likely to be be-\ntwixt the King and Parliament, thought\npolitickly to engage the city for him. He\ngives the citizens good worJs, tells them,\nhe will give them their lands in Ireland\nagain, a promife he was never able to\nperform,\n\fof King CHARLES I, 229\nperform, &c. As I remember at their\nrequeft, he alfo kept his Chriftmas at\nWhitehall, intending otherways to have\nkept it at Hampton-Court, and alfo knight-\ned fome of the Aldermen. At his return\nfrom Scotland, he affirmed in a fpeech\nlie made unto both Houfes, how he had\nleft that kingdom in as quiet and good\ncondition as eould be expe&ed. The\ndevil was in the crags of the Scots, if he\nleft them not contented, who gave them\nwhateyer they required, and figned what-\never they defired or demanded, confirmed\nas much as their large confeiences could\nrequire.\nBut now in January 1641, began a\nfea of misfortunes to fall upon us, and\noverwhelm our long-continued happinefs,\nby difagreement of the King and the two\nHoufes of Parliament, and partly by the\ndaily coming to the Parliament Houfe of\nmany hundred citizens, fometimes in very\nrude manner. True it is, the King dif-\nliked thefe too frequent addreffes unto\nboth Houfes in fo tumultuous and un-\nwarrantable a manner : whereupon, fear-\ning the worft (as himfelf pretended) he\nhad a court of guard before Whitehall of\nthe trained-bands. He ha4 alfo many\ndiffolute gentlemen, and fome very civil,\nthat kept within Whitehall, with their\nfwords by their fidgs, to be ready upon\nQ^3 any\n\f230 On the Life and Death\nany fudden occafion. Verily, mens fears\nnow began to be great, and it was by\nmany perceived, the King began to fwell\nwith anger againft the proceedings of\nParliament, and to intend a war againft\nthem : fome fpeeches dropped from him\nto that purpofe. It happened one day,\nas fome of the ruder fort of citizens\ncame by Whitehall, one bufy citizen muft\nneeds cry, ' No Bifhops fome of the\ngentlemen iflued out of Whitehall, either\nto corre\u00a3t the faucinefs of the fool in\nwords, if they would ferve, elfe it feems\nwith blows : what palled on either fide\nin words, none but themfelves knew;\nthe citizen being more tongue than fol-\ndier, was wounded, and I have heard,\ndied of his wounds received at that time.\nIt hath been affirmed by very many, that in\nor near unto that place where this fellow\nwas hurt and wounded, the late KING'S\nhead was cut off, the SCAFFOLD\n(landing juft over that place.\nThofe people or citizens who ufed thus\nto flock unto Weftminfter, were moft of\nthem men of mean or a middle quality\nthemfelves ; no Aldermen, Merchants, or\nCommon-Council Men, but fet on by\nfome of better quality ; and yet moft of\nthem were either fuch as had publick\nfpirits, or lived a more religious life than\nthe vulgar, and were ufually called Puri-\n1 tans,\n\fof King CHARLES I. 231\ntans, and had fuffered under the tyranny\nof the Bifhops : in the general they were\nvery honeft men, and well meaning.\nSome particular fools, or others, per-\nhaps now and then got in amongft them,\ngreatly to the difadvantage of the more\nfober. They were modeft in their appa-\nrel, but not in language : they had the\nhair of their heads, very few of them,\nlonger than their ears : whereupon it\ncame to pafs, that thofe who ufually with\ntheir cries attended at Weftminfter, were,\nby a nick name, called Roundheads. The\ncourtiers again wearing long hair and\nlocks, and always fworded, at laft were\ncalled by thefe men Cavaliers : and fo after\nthat this broken language had been ufed a\nwhile, all that adhered to the Parliament\nwere termed Roundheads ; all that took\npart or appeared for his Majefty Cavaliers\n;\nfew of the vulgar knowing the fenfe of\nthe word Cavalier. However, the pre-\nfent hatred of the citizens were fuch un-\nto gentlemen, efpecially courtiers, that\nfew durft come into the city ; or if they\ndid, they were fure to receive affronts,\nand be abufed.\nTo fpeak freely and ingenuoufly, what\nI then obferved of the city tumults, was\nthis. Firft, the fufferings of the citizens\nwho were any thing well devoted, had,\nduring all this King's reign, been fuch,\n0^4 and\n\f232 On the Life and Death\nand fo great, being harrowed or abufed\ncontinually, either with the High Com-\nmiflion Court, or the Star Chamber, that\nas men in whofe breafts the fpirit of liber-\nty had fome place, they were even glad\nto vent out their fighs and iufferings in\nthis rather tumultuous than civil man-\nner ; being affured, if ever this Parlia-\nment had been diflblved, they mult have\nbeen racked, whipped, and ftripped by\nthe fnotty clergy, and other extravagant\ncourfes. And for any amendment which\nthey might expect from the King, they\ntoo well knew his temper : that though\nin a time of Parliament he often pro-\nmifed to redrefs any grievances, yet the\nbeft friend he hath, cannot produce any\none aft of good for his fubjefts done\nby him in the vacancy of a Parliament.\nThe lofers ufually have leave to fpeak,\nand fo had the citizens.\nAll this Chriftmas 1641, there was no-\nthing but private whifperings in Court,\nand fecret councils held by the Queen,\nand her party, with whom the King fat\nin council very late many nights. What\nwas the particular refult of thofe clan-\ndeftine confutations, it will prefently ap -\npear.\nJanuary 4, 1641. By what finifler\ncouncil led, I know not, but the King\nin perfon went into the then Lower\nHoufe\n\fof King CHARLES I. 233\nHoufe of Parliament, where the Com-\nmons r2t9 and for fome things he had\nbeen informed of, demanded five of their\nprincipal members, viz. Pimm, Hollis,\nHazlerigg, Hainbden, and Stroud. In\nthat book called his Portraiture, he af-\nfirms, he went to the Houfe of Com-\nmons to demand juftice upon thofe five\nmembers ; and faith, * He thought he\n* had difcovered fome unlawful corre-\n' fpondencies and engagements they had\n* made to embroil his kingdoms.' He\nconfeffeth he miffed but little of pro-\ncuring fome writings, &c. to make his\nthoughts good. So here is no evidence\nagainfl- thefe members, but his own\nthoughts, as himfelf confeffeth. But\naffuredly, had he demanded juftice of the\nHoufe of Commons againfl them, and\nproved his charge, he might have had\nit ; but for himfelf to attach their bodies,\nand be Judge alfo (as he intended) was\na matter moft unequal. And furely,\nhad it been in his power to have got\ntheir bodies, he would have ferved thefe\nmembers as he did Elliot, whom with-\nout caufe he committed to the tower,\nand never would either releafe him, or\nfhew caufe of his commitment, till death.\nAll that time he had a guard with him\nat the doors of the Houfe of Parliament,\nconfifting of many gentlemen with hal-\nberts\n\f_j4 On the Life and Death\nberts and fvvords. Truly, I did not hear\nthere was any incivility offered by thofe\ngentlemen then attending unto any mem-\nber of the Houfe, his Majefty having given\nthem ftridt commands to the contrary.\nThis rafh aftion of the King's loft him\nhis Crown : for as he was the firft of\nKings that ever, or fo imprudently, brake\nthe privileges by his entrance into the\nHoufe of Commons aflcmbled in Parlia-\nment; fo by that unparalleled demand\nof his, he utterly loft himfelf, and left\nfcarce any poflibility of reconcilement ; he\nnot willing to truft them, nor they him,\nwho had fo often failed them. It was\nmy fortune that very day to dine in\nWhitehall, and in that room where the\nhalberts, newly brought from the tower,\nwere lodged, for ufe of fuch as attended\nthe King to the Houfe of Commons.\nSir Peter Wich, ere we had fully dined,\ncame into the room I was in, and brake\nopen the chefts wherein the arms were,\nwhich frighted us all that were there.\nHowever, one of our company got out\nof doors, and prefently informed fome\nmembers, that the King was preparing\nto come unto the Houfe $ elfe I believe\nall thofe members, or fome of them, had\nbeen taken in the Houfe. All that I\ncould do further was prefently to be\ngone. But it happened alfo the fame\n\fof King CHARLES L 235\nday, that fqme of my neighbours were\nat the court of guard at Whitehall, unto\nwhom I related the King's prefent defign,\nand conjured them to defend the Parlia-\nment and members thereof, in whofe\nwell or ill doing confifted our happinefs\nor misfortune : they promifed affiftance if\nneed were, and I believe would have\nftoutly flood to it for defence of the Par-\nliament, or members thereof. The King\nloft his reputation exceedingly by this\nl}is improvident and unadvifed demand\n:\nyet notwithftanding this his failing, fo\nwilful and obftinate he was in purfu-\nance of that prepofterous courfe he in-\ntended, and fo defirous to compafs the\nbodies of thefe five members, that the\nnext day he pofted and trotted into the\ncity to demand the members there. He\nconvened a meeting at Guildhall. The\nCommon Council afTembled : but mum\ncould he get there, for the word London-\nDeny was then frefh in every man's\nmouth.\nBut whereas the author of the King's\nPortraiture complains, < That the info-\n* lency of the tumults was fuch, that his\n' Majefty's perfon was in danger in the\n* ftreets.' This is a very untruth : for\nnotwithftanding his Majefty dined in the\ncity that day he required the five mem-\nbers pf the citizens, yet he had no in-\ncivility\n\f236 On the Life and Death\ncivility in the leaft meafure offered unto\nhis perfon ; only many cried out as he\npaffed the ftreets, 1\nSir, let us have our\n* juft liberties, we defire no more\/ Un-\nto which he feveral times anfvvered, '\nThey\n' fhouid,' &c.\nAn honejft citizen, as I remember,\nthrew into his coach a new fermon, the\ntext whereof was, as I now remember,\n' To thy tents, O Ifrael.' Indeed the citi-\nzens (unto their everlafting honour be it\nfpoken) did with much refolution pro^\nte6l the five members : and many thou-\nfands were willing to facrifice their lives\nfor defence of the Parliament, and the\nfeveral members thereof.\nThe tenth of January approached and\ncame : upon which day the five demanded\nmembers were brought into the Houfe of\nCpmmons with as much triumph as\ncould be exprefied, feveral companies of\ntrained bands marchipg to the Parliament\nto aftift if need were. There were upon\nthe River Thames I know not how many\nbarges full of failqrs, having fome guns\nready charged, if occafion were : and\nthefe alfo came in multitudes to ferve\nthe Parliament. A word dropped out of\nthe King's mouth a little before, which\nloft him the love of the feamen. Some\nbeing in conference with his Majefty,\nacquainted him, that he was loft in the\nafte\u00a3lion\n\fof King CHARLES L 237\naffettion of the feamen, for they intended\nto petition the houfe, &c. * I wonder\/\nquoth the King, ' how I have loft the\n4\naffe&ion of thole water-rats.' A word\nfure that flipped out of his mouth un-\nadvifedly ; for all men muft and do know,\nthat the (hips of England, and our va-\nliant failors, are the very ftrength of Eng-\nland.\nHis Majefty finding nothing thrived\non his fide, and feeing the abundant af-\nfection of the commonalty in general for\nthe Parliament, the aforefaid tenth of\nJanuary 1 64 1, went unto Hampton-Court,\nand never after could by entreaty, or\notherwife, be drawn to come unto his Par-\nliament, though they in moft humble wife,\nand by many and feveral addrefles, ex-\nceedingly defired it. One misfortune fol-\nlows another: for the 25th of February,\n1641, the Queen went into Holland, and\nafterwards the King into Yorfhire. There\nwas at this time a fufficient magazine\nof arms in Hull, being the remainder\nof thofe employed again ft the Scots. The\nParliament fent down a member of their\nown, one Sir John Hotham, to take care\nof them ; who undertook, and alfo did\nmaintain the town, and preferve the arms\ntherein for the Parliament. Although his\nMajefty, in April 1642, came unto the\nwalls of the town to require them, yet\ncouid\n\f23S On the Life and Death\ncould he neither procure arms, or admit-\ntance into the town.\nThe Earl of Warwick, exceedingly be-\nloved of the feamen, fecured the navy;\nfo that in few days the Parliament had\nftore of arms for land foldiers, and plenty\nof ftout fhips for their fea occafions. His\nMajefty in the mean time being deftitute\nboth of the affe&ions of his people, and\nmeans to fupply an army, which it was\nperceived he intended fhortly to raife, re-\nturned from viewing Hull unto York.\nThe Parliament having perfe\u00a3t intelli-\ngence, and being allured he would raife\nan army againft them, began to con-\nfider of their prefent condition; whom\nto make their General ; how to raife\nmen and money for their own, and\ncommonwealth's, defence. But one would\nhave bleffed himfelf to fee what running\nand trotting away here was both of Lords\nand Commons unto his Majefty. I do\naflure you a very thin houfe was left\n:\nof Lords who remained, Efiex the peo-\nple's darling was chief; a moft noble\nfoul, and generally well efteemed : he in\nthis exigency was by both houfes nomi-\nnated and voted the Parliament's Gene-\nral. I do herein admire at the wonder-\nful providence of Almighty God, who\nput it into the peoples hearts to make\nthis man General, this very Earl, this\n\fof King CHARLES L 239\ngood man, who had fuffered beyond be-\nlief, by the partial judgment of King\nJames ; who to fatisfy the letchery of a\niuftful Scot, took away Effex's wife (being\na lewd woman) for one Carr, alias Somer-\nfetj fhe pretending EfTex was Frigidits in\nCorfu, and old Jemmy believing it.\nHad EfTex refufed to be General, our\neaufe in all likelihood had funk in the\nbeginning, we having 'never a Noble-\nman at that time, either willing or ca-\npable of that honour and preferment:\nindeed, fcarce any of them were fit to be\ntrufted. So that God raifed up EfTex\nto be a fcourge for his fon, whofe father\nhad fo unjuftly abufed him. And for\nthe Countefs, fhe had abundance of for-\nrow ere fhe died, and felt the divine hand\nof heaven againft her; for fhe was un-\ncapable of coition at leaft a dozen years\nere fhe died, having an impediment in\nthat very member fhe had fo much de-\nlighted in and abufed : and this I had\nfrom the mouth of one who faw her\nwhen bowelled. For Somerfet himfelf,\nhe died a poor man, contemptible and\ndefpifed of every man ; and yet I never\nheard any ill of that Scotchman, except\nin this alone bufinefs concerning the Earl\nof EfTex, and his wife. In this fummer\nthe citizens lifted themfelves plentifully\nfor\n\f24\u00b0 Ox T & E Lif\u00a3 and Death\nfor foldiers . Horfe and arms were provided,\nand the Lord knows how many trea-\ncherous knaves had command in this firft\nexpedition in the Parliament army : fo that\nif God himfclf had not been on our fide,\nwe muft of necefnty have perifhed.\nThe youth of the City of London\nmade up the major part of Effex's in-\nfantry. His horfes were good, but the\nriders unlkilful : for they were taken up\nas they came and lifted, or offered them-\nfelves unto the fervice. The truth is,\nthe Parliament were at that time glad to\nfee any mens willingnefs and forwardnefs\nunto their fervice ; therefore they pro-\nmifed largely, and made fome pleafing\nvotes ; fo that the plate and monies of\nthe citizens came tumbling into Guild-\nhall upon the publick faith.\nHis Majefty in the interim, and at\nthat time, was neceffitated for money\nand arms extreamly, having no magazine\nto command, but thofe of the northern\ncounties yea, into what other county\nfoever he came (and he traverfed many)\nhe was fo courteous, as he made fhift to\nfeize their arms, and carry them along\nfor his ufe, pretending for the fafety of\nthe people, and his perfon.\nThe King had lain moft part at York,\nor rambled into fome other counties near\nadjacent until Auguft, and done little to\nany\n\fof King CHARLES t $4t\namy piirpofe ; for the feverai counties were\ngenerally nothing inclinable to his pur-\npofe : in moft whereof, and in every\ncounty he came in, he rather received\npetty affronts than fupport : yet at laft\nhe came to Nottingham, and there fef\nup his STANDARD (with a full refo-\nlution for war) the 2 2d of Auguft, 1642,\nunder this conftellation, having fome few\nhorfe with him; but in great expefta-\ntion of more aid from the Welch, &C*\nyvhom he thought moft doted on monarchy*\n-dardfirftfetup\natNottingham\nl6\n6H^MmRM\nadno\nV\n>x\u00bbv>\nTo. >\nThe heralds, or at leaft thofe who theti\nWere with the King, Were ignorant how,\nR and\n\f242 On the Life and Death\nand in what manner to fet up the Stan-\ndard Royal : they therefore hung it out\nin one of the turrets, or upper rooms\nof Nottingham Caftle, within the Caflle\nWall. King Richard the Third fet up\nhis Standard there, &c. His Majefty dif-\nliked his Standard was placed within the\ncaftle. He faid it was to be placed in an\nopen place, where all men that would\nmight freely come unto it, and not in a\nprifon : they therefore carried it, at his\ncommand, without the caftle, towards or\ninto the park there adjoining, into an\nopen place and eafy of accefs. When\nthey came to fix it in the ground, they\nperceived it was a meer rock ftone, fo\nthat they with daggers and knives made\na fmall hole for the Standard to be put\nin ; but all would not ferve ; men were\ninforced for the prefent to fupport it with\nthe ftrength of their arms and bodies ;\nwhich gave great occafion unto fome\ngentlemen there prefent, to give a very fad\njudgment on the King's fide, and to divine\nlong beforehand, that he would never do\nany good by arms. I have alfo heard,\nthat in eight or ten days he had not thirty\nattended the Standard, or lifted them-\nfelves.\nAll the remainder of his life after this\nAuguft 22, 1642, was a meer labyrinth\nof ibrrow, a continued and daily misfor-\n2 tune,\n\fof King CHARLES I.\n243\ntune, unto which it feems providence had\nordained him from the very entrance of\nhis reign. His wars are wrote by feve-\nral learned hands, unto whom I refer the\nreader. I (hall only repeat a few more\nthings of him, and then conclude. Fa-\nvourites he had three ; Buckingham ftabbed\nto death; William Laud, and Thomas\nEarl of Strafford, both beheaded. Bi-\nfhops and Clergymen, whom he moll\nfavoured, and wholly advanced, and oc-\ncafionally ruined, he lived to fee their\nbifhopricks fold, the Bifhops themfelves\nfcorned, and all the whole clergy of his\nparty and opinion quite undone.\nThe Englifh Noblemen he cared not\nmuch for, but only to ferve his own turns\nby them : yet fuch as had the unhappi-\nhefs to adventure their lives and fortunes\nfor him, he lived to fee them and their\nfamilies ruined, only for his fake. Pity\nit is many of them had not ferved a more\nfortunate mafter, and one more grateful.\nThe Scots, his countreymen, on whom\nhe beftowed fo many favours, he lived to\nfee them in arms againft himfelf ; to fell\nhim for more money than the Jews did\nChrift, and themfelves to be handfomely\nrouted, and fold for knaves and Haves.\nThey made their beft market of him at all\ntimes, changing their affection with his\nfortune.\nR 2 The\n\f.244 On the Life and Death\nThe old Prince of Orange he almoft\nbeggared, and yet to no purpofe, the\nParliament one time or other getting all\narms and ammunition which ever came\nover unto him. It is confidently averred,\nif the King had become ablolute here in\nEngland, Orange had been King, &c.\nThe city of London, which he had fo\nfore oppreffed and flighted, he lived to fee\nthoufands of them in arms againft him\n;\nand they to thrive, and himfelf confume\nunto nothing. The Parliament, which\nhe fo abhorred, and formerly fcorned, he\nlived to know was fuperior unto him\n;\nand the fcorns and flights he had ufed\nformerly to Elliot, and others, he faw\nnow returned upon himfelf in folio.\nWith Spain he had no perfeft corre-\nfpondency, fmce his being there ; lefs after\nhe fuffered their fleet to perifh in his\nhavens ; leaft of all, after he received an\nAmbaflador from Portugal ; the Spaniard\never upbraiding him with falfhood, and\nbreach of promife. Indeed, the nativities\nof both Kings were very contrary.\nWith France he had no good amity;\nthe Proteftants there abhorring his leger-\ndemain and treachery unto Rochelle ; the\nPapifts as little loving or trufting him,\nfor fome hard meafure offered unto thofe\nof their religion in England. He cun-\nningly\n\fof King CHARLES I. 245\nningly would labour to pleafe all, but in\neffe6t gave fatisfaftion to none.\nDenmark could not endure him; fent\nhim little or no afliftance, if any at all\n:\nbefides, the old King fufpefted another\nmatter; and made a query in his drink.\nThe Swede extremely complained of him\nfor nonperformance of fome fecret con-\ntract betwixt them, and uttered high\nwords againft him.\nThe Proteftant PRINCES of Germany\nloathed his very name, &c.\nThe Portugal King and he had little to\ndo ; yet in one of his own letters to the\nQueen, though he acknowledges the Por-\ntugal's courtefy unto him, yet faith, that he\nwould give him an anfwer unto a thing of\nconcernment that fhould fignify nothing.\nThe Hollanders being only courteous\nfor their own ends, and as far as his money\nwould extend, furnifhed him with arms at\nfuch rates as a Turk might have had them\nelfewhere : but they neither loved or cared\nfor him in his profperity, or pitied him in\nhis adverfity ; which occafioned thefe words\nto drop from him, ' If he ere came to his\n(\nthrone, he would make Hans Butter- box\n* know, he Ihould pay well for his fifhing,\nc\nand fatisfy for old knaveries\/ &c.\nIn conclufion. He was generally un-\nfortunate in the world, in the efteem both\nR 3 of\n\f246 On the Life and Death\nof friends and enemies : his friends ex-\nclaim on his breach of faith ; his enemies\nwould fay, he could never be faft enough\nbound. He was more lamented as he was\na King, than for any affe&ion had unto\nhis perfon as a man.\nHe had feveral opportunities offered\nhim for his reftoring. Firft, by feveral\ntreaties, all ending in fmoke, by his own\nperverfenefs. By feveral opportunities\nand vi6lories which he profecuted not.\nFirft, when Briftol was cowardly fur-\nrendered by Fines : had he then come un-\nto London, all had been his own ; but\nloitering to no purpofe at Gloucefter, he\nwas prefently after well banged by EfTex.\nWhen in the weft, viz.

Many\nfuch misfortunes attended him ; fo that\none may truly fay, he was Regum infceli-\ncijfimus. Some affirm before his death fe-\nyeral prodigies appeared. All I obferved\na long time before, was, that there ap-\npeared almoft in every year after 1664*\nfeveral parelia, or mock-funs ; fometimes\ntwo, fometimes three.

Some, who faw him\nemhowelled, affirm, had he not come\nunto this untimely end, he might have\nlived, according unto nature, even unto\nthe height of old age.\nMany have curioufly enquired who it\nwas that cut off his head : I have no per-\nmillion to fpeak of fuch things ; only\nthus much I fay, he that did it, is as\nvaliant and refolute a man as lives, and\none of a competent fortune -f.\nKing Charles being dead, and fome\nfoolifh citizens going a whoring after his\npifture or image, formerly fet up in the\nOld Exchange ; the Parliament made\nbold to take it down, and to engrave in\nits place thefe words\n:\nExit Tyrannies Regum ultimus> Anno Li-\nbertatis Anglia rejiitutce primoy Anno Dom.\n1648.

Let me alfo add unto\nthis, a very ancient prophecy of the\nWelch, viz.\nKoronog fab Ane a wn& ddiwedh ar y\ndaroganeu.\nIn Englifh thus 2\nThe fonne of Ann crowned, ends all our\n\fof King CHARLES I. 257\nWe never had yet any King whofe\nmother's name was Anne ; but King\nCharles's mother was Anne, fifter to the\nKing of Denmark, late deceafed.\nThe putting to death of the late King\nwas prophefied of above eighty years be-\nfore it was done, by Noftradamus : the\nbook itfelf was printed about 1578, as I\nremember in century the 9th : thefe are\nthe words,\nSenat de Londres mettront a mort leur\nRoy, viz.\nThe Senate or Parliament of London,\nftiall put to death their King.\nThefe examples (hew, that chriftians\nhave had the fpirit of prophecy, and\nforetold plainly many ages before, what\nfhould fu&eed.\nThe moft fignificant of all our Englifh\nprophecies, is that of Ambrofe Merlin,\nwhich I have made choice of in the firft\nplace, repeating orderly a verfe of the\nprophecy, and then how it was fulfilled.\nS A Pro-\n\f[ 2 5 8 ]\nA Prophecy of the White King,\nwrote by Ambrofe Merlin, nine\nhundred years Unce, concern-\ning CHARLES the late\nKING.\n' TT THEN the Lion of Rightful-\nc\nVV nefle is dead, then lhall arife a\n* White King in Brittaine, firft flying,\n' and after riding, after ligging downe,\n' and in this ligg down, he fhall be lymed,\n* and after that he fhall be led\/\nWe have feen with our own eyes, and\nthoufands befides, firft King James, who\nreigned peaceably, and was therefore called\nJacofa\/s Pacifiais, is dead, viz. that ftyling\nhimfelf King of Great-Britain, ^and reign-\ning two and twenty years, died 1625, the\n27th of March. Many affirmed he had the\npifture of a lion on his breaft or fide\n;\nbut it is probable he had fome eminent\nnatural mole there, which might caufe\nthat error ; becaufe in his nativity he had\nboth Saturn and Mars in Leone. In re-\ngard of the great tranquillity and peace\nwe enjoyed in King James's time, and\nthe little or no blood fhed in his reign ;\nand in confideration of the propagation,\n\fof King CHARLES i. 259\nand free admittance of the gofpel all over\nthis kingdom, he was rightly by the Pro-\nphet ftyled, < The LION of Rightful*\n' neffe.' But if the Prophet had given\nhim the name of Lion in any other\nfenfe, he had notorioufly failed; being\nKing James was the moft pufillanimous\nPrince of fpirit that ever we read of, and\nthe leaft addifted unto martial difcipline.\nBut in judgment either in things divine\nor human (whilft fober or unbiased) the\nmoft acute and piercing of any Prince\neither before or fince. He was admo-\nnifhed of his death by a dream. He\ndreamed that his mafter Buchanan ap-r.\npeared unto him in his fleep, and gave\nhim thefe two verfes. I thought good\nfor the rarity thereof to repeat them.\nSexte verere Deum, tibi vitce terminus inflate\nCum tua candentiJiagrat carbunculus igne.\nThe Englifli whereof is\n;\nThou James the Vlth of that name,\nKing of Scots, fear God, the term of\nthy life is near or at hand, when thy\ncarbuncle-ftone burns in the hot fire,\nThe King told his bed-chamber men,\nand fome other Lords, of thefe verfes next\nmorning, relating them really, and averred\nS 2 i\\Q\n\f260 On the Life and Death\nhe made not the verfes, nor could his\nmafter Buchanan ever almoft get him to\nmake a Latin verfe. The fuccefs was\nthus : the King had a very large and fair\ncarbuncle ftone ufually fet in his hat ;\nand we have feen him pi&ured many\ntimes with fuch a carbuncle fixed to his\nhat. But thus it happened : fitting by\nthe fire, not long after, this great car-\nbuncle fell out of his hat, and into the\nfire : a Scottifh Lord took it up, and\nobferved the King fickened, and alfo died\nvery fhortly after.\nAfter King James was dead, Charles\nStuart, his then only fon, was proclaimed\nKing of Great Britain, by a general con-\nfent of the people, his title being unques-\ntionable. The occafion of the Prophet's\ncalling him White King, was this : The\nKings of England anciently did wear the\nday of their coronation purple cloaths,\nbeing a colour only fit for Kings : both\nQueen Elizabeth, King James, and all\ntheir anceftors did wear that colour the\nday of their coronation, as any may per-\nceive by the records of the wardrobes.\nContrary unto this cuftom, and led unto\nit by the indireft and fatal advice of Wil-\nliam Laud, Archbifhop of Canterbury,\nhe was perfuaded to apparel himfelf the\nday of his coronation in a white gar-\nment. There were fome dehorted him frpm\nwearing\n\fof King CHARLES I. 261\nwearing the white apparel, but he obfti-\nnately refufed their counfel. Canterbury-\nwould have it as an apparel reprefenting\nthe King's innocency, or I know not what\nother fuperftitious device of his. And\nof this there is no queftion to be made,\nmyfelf, though not occularly feeing him\nthat day, yet have had it related verbally\nby above twenty, whofe eyes beheld it;\none or two were workmen that carried\nhis Majefty's apparel that day ; fo that I\nchallenge all the men upon earth living,\nto deny his wearing white apparel that\nday of his coronation, &c. It is alfo\nreported, and I believe it to be true, that\nfuch was his hafte to have the crown\nupon his head, that he had not patience\nto wait the coming of the Archbifhop,\nwhofe office it was to do it, but impa-\ntiently in great hafte, he placed the crown\nupon his head with his own hands ; which\nmoved the Spanifh AmbafTador, who was\nthen prefent, to fay, ' The King's putting\n* the crown upon his head fo rafhly with\n\u20ac\nhis own hands, was an ill omen.'\n* Firft flying\/\n'\nKing Charles fummons a Parliament,\nNovember 1640: the troubles of Scot-\nland arifing in 1641, he left the Englifh\nParliament fitting, and went in perfon\nS 3 himfelf\n\f262 Otf the Life and Death\nhimfelf to fettle the difturbed affairs of\nScotland. He came home to London\nabout November, and was himfelf and\nQueen royally entertained by the citizens,\nwho cried then ' Hofanna,' &c. But fee\nhow fuddenly many of the fame city cry\n* Crucify, crucify\/ For lo, in January\n1 64 1, the citizens of London, and other\nrude people, in great numbers flock down\nunto the Parliament, and affront the King,\nthe Bifhops, and other temporal Lords\n:\nwhich rudenefs and faucinefs of theirs,\nas himfelf pretended, moved him, the 10th\nof January, 1641, firft to fly or remove\nunto Hampton-Court, then to Windfor,\nthen into Kent, from thence into York-\nshire ; fo that all the remainder of his\nlife, until he furrendered his perfon to\nthe Scots, was running and flying from\none place to another. I muft ingenuoufly\nacknowledge, my eyes were witnefs of\nvery great rudenefs in the citizens, and\nof as great a defect of civility and judg-\nment in fome courtiers, unto thofe ill-\nbred citizens.\n* And after riding.'\nThe firft horfe his JVIajefty raifed, were\nin Yorkfhire, and thefe in or about July,\nAuguft, and September, 1642, pretend-\ning they were for a guard for his perfon\n:\nfrom\n\fof King CHARLES h 263\nfrom which time, until the very time he\nrendered himfelf to his countrymen the\nScots, which was May, 1646, he had an\narmy of horfe, and was frequently him-\nfelf amongft them : though it is not once\nreported himfelf ever charged, as he was\nfometimes invited unto it by the Lord\nCharles Gerrard, a mod gallant man,\nwho would fay unto him many times,\n* CHARGE, SIR\/ &c. And indeed,\nwho would have loft three kingdoms,\nwithout firft lofing fome blood in the\nquarrel\n!\n* After ligging downe.'\nFrom the time of his own voluntary\nrendition unto the Scots, until his dying\nday, he was never in the head of an\narmy, but did ligg down or lie flill, and\nwas carried up and down from one place\nto another as a prifoner : yet had he\nvery great liberty until he difcharged him-\nfelf of his own word or parol at Hampton-\nCourt, and immediately efcaped to the\nMe of Wight.\n\u2022 In this ligg down he fhall be lymed\/\nDuring the time of his imprifonment,\nor from that time the Scots fold his perfon\n\\into us for two hundred thoufand pounds,\nS 4 it\n\f264 On the Life and Death\nit may properly be faid, * In this ligg down\n\u2022 he fhall be lymed\/ that is, he was at-\ntempted and allured firft by one fide, then\nanother ; or he was feveral times, and by\nfeveral occafions, tempted or treated with-\nal, (every one thinking themfelves fureft\nwho poffeffed his perfon) fometimes by\nthe Scots, other times by the Englifh, as\nwell Parliament as army : but notwith-\nstanding all overtures, his perfon was ftill\nfafe looked unto, &c.\n4\nAnd after that he fhall be led\/\nAfter that propofitions had been pre-\nfented unto him at Hampton-Court, and\nlaft of all at the Ifle of Wight, he re-\nfuting to fign them, or give fuch fatis-\nfaclion as was required; from that time,\nviz. from December, 1648, until his\ndeath, he was led, viz. he was more\nftriclly guarded and imprifoned than ever\n;\nnor from that time had the benefit of his\nliberty as formerly he had had, but was\nremoved firft to one caftle, then to ano-\nther; then to Windfor, then laft of all\nto Whitehall. So that moft properly he\nmay be faid to be now led. For I dare\nfwear he went and came into all thefe\nplaces moft unwillingly.\n1\nAnd\n\fof King CHARLES I. 265\n* And there (hall be (hewed whether\n' there be another King\/\nSince King Charles did retreat from his\nParliament, they on the behalf of the\ncommonwealth afted as Kings, ufing re-\ngal command, railing armies, monies,\ntaxes, & quid non, breaking his Majefty's\nGreat Seal, nlaking a new one of their own,\nand fmce have altered the frame of govern-\nment, and converted monarchy into a\ncommonwealth.\n* Then fhall bee gadered togather much\n' folk, and he fhall take helpe for him.'\nHow many of the nobility, gentry, and\nclergy, and what numbers of the com-\nmonalty affifted him, we know, and\nthey who were his affiftants do well to\ntheir coft remember : for indeed, the\ngreateft part of the nobility, and gentry,\nand priefthood, moft cordially and unani-\nmoufly followed him, and affifted him to\nthe hazard of their lives, and confumption\nof eftates. And we know, even whilft\nhe was in Carifbrook-Caftle, what a re-\nbellion was raifed by Goring, and others,\n&c. in Kent and Effex 1648, befides that\ngreat army of Scots and Englifh routed\ni\\\\ Lancafhire.\n< And\n\f266 On the Life and Death\n' And there fhall be merchandife of men,\n' as of an horfe or an ox.'\nThis part of the prophecy was exaftly\nverified in King Charles's, or the White\nKing's Time; for in 1648, after the de-\nfeat of the wretched Scots in Lancafhire,\nthe Englifh merchants did give money\nfor as many of the common foldiers as\nwere worth any thing, and fent them for\nBarbadoes and other foreign plantations.\nSome were fold dear, others cheap, ac-\ncording to the quality of the perfon or\nprofeffion he was of. It is reported, that\nmany of thofe miferable wretches, fmce\ntheir being at the Barbadoes, do fay,\nthey have left hell, viz. Scotland, and\nare arrived into heaven. There was in\n1644, 1645, &c. exchanging of foldiers\nand prifoners ; but in 1648, abfolute\nmerchandifmg of mens bodies, and not\nbefore. What price the Scots were fold\nfor, I know not : he that gave but\ntwelve pence apiece for any of that nafly\npeople, gave too much.\n\u2022 There fhall bee fought helpe, and there\n* fhall none arife, but bed for head.'\nWhat Prince or State of Europe, was\nnot attempted fmce 1642, unto 1648, to\nalM his late Majefty ? but in vain. Pro-\nvidence\n\fof King CHARLES L 267\nvidence being not to be deluded by any\nmortal man : each man that affifted, had\nonly a bed for his head, viz. a grave or\npiece of earth for his burial. And how\nmany royal Englifh families, both of\ngentry and nobles, I pity to relate, who\nhave mifcarried for his fake.\n* And then fhall one gone there the fun\n* arifeth, another there the fun gone\nf\ndowne\/\nIntimating no more, but that the fear\nand fadnefs of thofe times fhould be fuch,\nas fhould caufe feveral perfons to leave this\nkingdom or nation, for their fafety, as\nmany nobles and gentry, who took part\nwith him did, fome going to Holland,\nothers to France, others to feveral coun-\ntries, as their fancies or occafions led\nthem : or it may import his Majefty\nfhould go Eaftward or North-Eaft, as he\ndid when he went firft to the Scots ; and\nthe Queen before went Weftward or\nSouth-Weft, viz. to France. I pity ex-\nceedingly the fad condition of many noble\nfamilies, which ftill to this day continue,\nin foreign parts, poor, beggarly, and in\na moft uncomfortable condition.\n1\nAfter this, it (hall be faid by Britain,\n' (King is King,) King is no King: after\n'this hee fhall raife his head, and he\n* fhall be taken to be a King.'\nAfter\n\f268 On the Life and Death\nAfter he went to the Scots, and whilft\nhe was in durance, he was treated with\nboth by England and Scotland, as a\nKing. Yet afterwards it appeared he had\nnot the power of a King, to conclude\nany thing : nay, afterward our Parlia-\nment made a vote,\n* That no Addreffes fhould be made unto\n' him any more.'\nBut that vote was repealed, and addreffes\nwere made, but to no purpofe. So that\nthe Prophet faid well, ' Sometimes King\n;\n* after, King is no King\/ &c.\nc\nBee many things to done, but wife men\n* reading, &c. and then fhall a range of\n* gleeds, and ever each hath bereaving,\n* he fhall have it for his owne.'\nI conceive this intimates no more than\nthe multiplicity of affairs in thefe times\n:\nbut whether by the range of gleeds, he\nintend either the Parliament themfelves,\nor the army, or the Parliament's fub-\nofficers, I know not. I conceive here are\nfome words wanting in the copy, which\nmight lead to explain thefe words, viz.\n' And hee fhall have it for his owne\/\nUnlefs\n\fof King CHARLES I. 269\nUnlefs it be intended, thofe meant by the\nrange of gleeds, viz. great oppreffors, or\nthole who then rule or command, fhall\nhave all for their own ; the Latin copy-\nhath no more, but\nPofl hcec erit tempus mihomm> & quod\nqui\/que rapuerit, pro fuo habebit.\nViz. After thefe things, it (hall be a\ntime of kites or gleeds, and what every\nman can get or purloin, he will take it\nfor his own. And this feems to be the\ngenuine fenfe of it : for how many very\npoor men have we known to arrive unto\ngreat eflates, fince thefe times, even to\nthoufands a year and more ? Some, I\nknow myfelf, were men of very mean\nfortunes in the beginning of this Parlia-\nment, that are now fo elevated, fo proud,\nfo rich, fo arrogant, having had a hand\nin fome publick employments, they fcorn\ntheir kindred and country, forget their\nbirth and that neighbourhood which\nbrought them to this height of honour\n:\nand although like poor fneaks they came\nto London in leather-breeches, and in\n1642 were but vulgar fellows; yet now\ncoach it with four or two horfes, are\nimpudent, becaufe in authority: yet to\nrequire fome of thefe, to write true Eng-\nlifh, or fpeak fenfe, were to command a\n\f270 On the Life and Death\nf\u2014t from a dead man : but fuch as thele\nmuft know, if they have good eftates as\nthat they have, we of the commonalty\nmuft have an account of our treafure.\n< And this {hall laft feven yeares, loe\nc\nravening and fliedding of bloud.'\nIf we confider that our wars began in\nAnno 1642, we fliall then find that our\ndiftempers and wars have continued feven\nwhole years, within our own kingdom ;\nfor one copy hath it,\nEt feptennio durabit guerra intra.\nThe war fliall endure feven years within\nthe bowels of the kingdoms : and whereas\nhe mentions ravening, I conceive where\nthe foldier is quartered, that action of\nravening cannot be avoided. England\nhath felt free quarter, both of her ov\/n\ncountrymen, and of the Scots and Scotifh\narmy, who were the trueft harpies that\never lived, ftealing and purloining where-\never they came, even unto a difh-clout.\nYou fliall have one example of two Scots\nin Lancafliire 1648, quartered there in\na poor houfe, where they got a kettle of\nbrafs, being all their poor landlord had,\nand having it on the fire with oatmeal\nboiling in ale or milk 3 an alarum comes,\n\fof King CHARLES I. 2jt\nand one of their own countrymen pafles\nby and invites thefe two foldiers to run\naway, for all was loft. But fee their\nvillany, and prefent reward of thefe two\nfools : away they trudge, but carry the\nkettle and porridge on a ftaff betwixt\nthem, their landlord in vain crying out\nfor his kettle. But it pleafed God an ho-\nneft trooper of ours, making hafte to pur-\nfue the knaves, flew both thefe gluttons,\nand fo returned the kettle to the right\nowner,\n' And ovens ftiall be made like kirkes or\nc\nchurches\/\nIf it were not publickly done in many\nplaces of this kingdom before 1646, viz.\nthat churches were many times as beaftly\nas ovens: yet in 1648, and 1649, Paul's\nchurch was made a horfe-guard, and fo\ncontinued until of late.\nAfter, ' Then fhall come through the\n* fouth with the fun, on horfe of tree,\n\u20ac\nthe chicken of the eagle fayling into\n* Brittaine, and arriving anone to the Houfe\n* of the eagle, hee (hall fliew fellowfhip to\n* them hearts\/\nHere the copies vary exceedingly, one\nfaying only,\nDeinde\n\f272 On the Life and Death\nDeinde Pullus Aquilce veniet fuper ligneos\nequos anno & fenio & erit guerra in Brit-\ntania.\nViz.

But upon further confi-\nderation, this chicken of the eagle will\nprove one of his Majefty's children. And\nwe remember, that the prefent Scots King\ndid about July 1648, upon the South or\nSouth-Eaft coaft of England, come in\nperfon unto the revolted fhips : he landed,\nor w as viftualled at Yarmouth, and then\nfailed towards Kent, but without fuccefs\n:\nHe alfo after that attempted Yarmouth,\n\fof King CHARLES I. 273\nbut that attempt proved fuccefflefs. But\nwhereas, the prophecy mentions, \u2022 He\n* fhould fhew (fellowfhip unto them\n\u2022 hearts.)' Thefe words are in no Latin\ncopy that I have feen : however, at that\ntime of the Prince's being at fea, here\nwas no treaty or overture either offered by\nhim unto the Parliament, or by them\nunto him ; only the reft of the fhips,\n.which revolted not, were feveral ways\ndealt with to deliver them up unto him.\nIf by the eagle be intended King Charles\nlately dead, as doubtlefs he was, the\nchicken of the eagle muft of confequence\nthen be one of his children, and the pre-\nfent King of Scotland ; and then the\nwords may have this fenfe : That the\nPrince at that time fliould be defirous of\ngetting fome footing or landing-place in\nKent (called here the High Houfe of the\nEagle) in regard Dover-Caftle ftandeth in\nKent on a rock : but failing there, he\nmade his journey to Yarmouth, and fb\nwas defirous to procure that town : but\nherein he alfo was deceived* It is evi-\ndent that the late King was the Eagle;\nfor he did nothing but fly or ride up and\ndown, during fome years, before his\nreftraint s and it muft of neceffity then\nfollow, that the chicken here mentioned\nis the Scots King for the chicken is men-\ntioned before the death of the King to\nT come\n\f274 \u00aeK TttE Life and Death\ncome from the Eaft ; and fo the Prince\ndid upon wooden horfes, viz.

Indeed, that oracle\nof the law, whilft he lived, Sir Robert\nHolborne, Knight, and my fingular friend,\nboth acquainted me of the man, and his\ngreat labour to fift out the matter wholly,\nere committed to the prefs. The Lord\nguide me in my ways, for I ferioufly pro-\nteft unto pofterity, I never received fuch\ninjurious afperfions or calumnies, from\nthofe who in reafon had caufe to be my\nenemies, viz. the Royalifts, as from many\nof our own party, or fuch as will or\nwould be called Roundheads.
