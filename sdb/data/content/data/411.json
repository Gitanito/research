E. Gurney and Mr. F. W. H. Myers on \"Some Higher Aspects of\nMesmerism.\" The topic dealt with on this occasion was silent\" willing\"\nand \"willing\" at a distance. The effects considered were (1) thE'>\ndefinite induction of trance; and (2) the performance by a \" su~ject \"\nof some act\" willed\" by his controller, but of which he had received\nno' intimation. Among other cases, a striking one of Esdaile's was\nquoted, where a blind man was mesmerised from a distanceof 20 yards.\nAs rega~ds the control of actions, it was pointed out how fallacious the\ninstances are which are popularly supposed to illustrate the power; but\nsome apparently genuine cases were given. Another topic-the prO:-\nduction of actual hallucinations by the will of some absent person-\nwas also touched on; but such cases do not seem to be specially\ndependent on definite mesmeric influence. A summary was then\ngiven of the way in wl1ich the authors' treatment of mesmerism,\nas so far published, differs from that of other writers; the main\npoints being (1) that \"hypnotic\" and \"mesmeric\" phenomena are\nboth admitted as genuine, while carefully distinguished; and (:1) that\nmesmerism is shown only to determine with special certainty events\nwhich are found also capable of spontaneous occurrence. Finally, the\ngreat desirability of extended experiment was urged. Much wearisome\nfailure and deceptive ambiguity must be expected; but by their power\nof throwing the mental machinery slightly out of gear, hypnotism and\nmesmerism may advance our knowledge of the more obscure mental\nphenomena in ways which would be impossible to direct introspection.\nThe Chairman said that he did not propose to invite discussion on\nthe paper which had been read, as it was likely that several of\nthose present would wish to address the meeting in reference to what\nMr. Hodgson would have to say, but at the close Mr. Gurney would\nbe glad to answer any questions on the suqject he had treated of. He\nnow asked Mr. Myers to take his place as Chairman, as he was\nabout to read the conclusions of the Committee on the alleged phenomena\nattested by members of the Theosophical Society.\nDigitized by Coog\n\f452 Journal of Societ!l\/or P8.1\/chical Re8earch. [July, 1885.\n- - - - - - \" - - \" - ----------\nMr. F. W. H. Myers having taken the chair, Professor Sidg-\nwick proceeded, on behalf of the Committee appointed to inves-\ntigate the alleged marvellous phenomena connected with the Theo-\nsophical Society, to read the followi\"ng statement of their conclusions :~\nThat of the letters put forward by Madame Coulomb, all those, at\nleast, which the Committee have had the opportunity of themselves\nexamining, and of submitting to the judgment of experts, are\nundoubtedly written by Madame Blavatsky; and suffice to prove that\nshe has been engaged in a long-continued combination with other\npersons to produce by ordinary means a series of apparent marvels for\nthe support of the Theosophic movement. That, in particular, the\nShrine at Adyar, through which letters purporting to come from\nMahatmas were received, was elaborately arranged with a view to the\nsecret insertion of letters and other objects through a sliding panel at\nthe back, and regularly used for this purpose by Madame Blavatsky or\nher agents. That there is consequently a very strong general presump-\ntion that all the marvellous narratives put forward as evidence of the\nexistence and occult power of the Mahatmas are to be explained as due\neither (a) to deliberate deception carried out by or at the instigation of\nMadame Blavatsky, or (b) to spontaneous illusion, or hallucination, or\nunconscious misrepresentation or invention on the part of the witnesses.\nThat after examining Mr. Hodgson's report of the results of his personal\ninquiries, they are of opinion that the testimony to these marvels is in\nno case sufficient, taking amount and character together, to resist the\nforce of the general presumption above mentioned.\nAccordingly, they think that it would be a waste of time to prolong\nthe investigation.\nAs to the correctness of Mr. Hodgo;;on's explanation of particular\nmarvels they do not feel called UpOt1to express any definite conclusion; as\non the one hand, they are not prepared to endorse every detail of\nthis explanation, and on the other hand they have perfect confi-\ndence in the impartiality and thoroughness of Mr. Hodgson's investi~\ngation, and they recognise that his means ofarriving at a correct conclu-\nsion are far beyond any to which they can lay claim.\nThere is only one special point on which the Committee think\nthemselves bound to state explicitly a modification of their original\nview. They said in eftect in their First Report that if certain phenomena\nwere not genuine it was very difficult to suppose that Colonel Olcott\nwas not implicated in the fraud. But after hearing what Mr. Hodgson\nhas to say as to Colonel Olcott's credulity, and inaccuracy in observa-\ntion and inference, they desire to disclaim any intention of imputing\nwilful deception to Colonel Olcott.\nThe Chairman then called on Mr. Hodgson to continue his Report\non the phenomena. connected with the Theosophical Society.\nDigitized by Coog\n\fJuly, 188.5.] Journal of Society for Psyclilcal Resea1\u00b7ch.\nMr. Hodgson, in doing so, dealt chiefly with letters declared to have\nbeen received \"phenomenally.\" The mental queries to which it was\nalleged instantaneous replieshadbeen given were always, so far ashecould\nlearn, such as might easily have been anticipated by Madame Blavatsky.\nThe envelopes in which Mahatma writing was found, and which were\ndeclared to be absolutely intact, might easily, in the cases he had been\nable to examine, have been opened and the contents abstracted, &c.\nMr. Hodgson described in detail the appearance of one of these\nenvelopes, which showed clear traces of its having been opened surrepti-\ntiously; and mentioncd a case described to him by Mr. Ezekiel, a Theoso-\nphist at Poona,which corroborated his own conclusions,but the details of\nwhich Mr. Ezekiel was unwilling to have published. Some of the letter-\nphenomena were probably arranged in the manner described in the\nJonrnal for April, where an account was given of a letter caused hy\nthe Coulombs to fall on Mr. Hodgson's head. The Mahatma letters\nwhich appeared at the headquarters after Madame Blavatsky's depar-\nture for Europe might in all cases have been arranged by Mr_ Damodar,\nand Mr. Hodgson gave instances of this. Other instances of falling\nletters had occurred in Bombay, when the Society's headquarters were\nthere; some of these letters might have been pushed through the inter-\nstices of the ceiling of the room where they fell, as Mr. Hodgson\nascertained by examining the premises; or in other cases through a slit\nin the ceiling-cloth, no inspection of which seems to have been made\nby witnesses of the phenomena. The disappearance of letters and other\nobjects from the top of a bookcase could be easily accounted for by the\nfact that behind the bookcase was a venetianed door near Babula's\nrooms, and Babula could have removed the letters, &c., by passing his\nhand through the venetians. It was in this way probably that the\npacket in the Vega case was made to \"evaporate\" while the witnesses\n\u00b7were out of the room.\nMr. Hodgson then referred to the Koot Hoomi writing, and said that\nafter a minute and prolonged examination of the writing, he considered\nit to be in most cases the handiwork of Madame Blavatsky, but in some\ncases that of Mr. Damodar. In various documents which had been\nkindly furnished by Mr. Sinnett for examination, numerous character-\nistic traces of M'ldame Blavatsky's handwriting were obvious, and the\ngradual elimination of some of these was manifest in successive letters,\nsuggesting that Madame Blavatsky acquired by degrees greater skill\nin the practice of the disguised hand. Mr. Hodgson illustrated his\nremarks on some of these characteristics by means of the blackboard,\nand quoted the positive conclusion of Mr. F. G. Netherclift, the well-\nknown caligraphic expert, that the Koot Hoomi series of documents\nfurnished by Mr. Sinnett were unquestionably written by Madame\nBla\u00b7mtsky.\nDigitized by Coog\n\f454 Journal qf Society for P8ycMcai Re8earck. [July, 1885.\nThe Chairman said that lIr. Hodgson would now be prepared to\nanswer questions as to his Report, and Professor Sidgwick as to the\nReport of the Committee. But first, it seemed fitting to invite the\nremarks of a gentleman to whom all present would listen with respectful\nattention on the subject of these phenomena. He begged leave to call\non Mr. Sinnett for any observations which he might wish to make.\nMr. Sinnett said that at the conclusion of his interesting paper~\nMr. Gurney had spoken of the ridicule and opposition which everyone\nengaged in psychical inquiry was liable to encounter, and suggested tha~\nin raising an easy laugh at the expense of some of the phenomena.\nhe had endeavoured to investigate, Mr. Hodgson had afforded\na prompt illustration of the justice of his colleague's remark.\nHe, however, desired to approach this subject in a serious spirit,\nas a Member of the Society for Psychical Research not less than as a\nTheosophist. It appeared to him that in this inquiry the Society ha.U\ntaken an entirely new departure. Hitherto when the guiding Mem-\nbers of the Society thought they had found evidence illustrating\nthe reality of psychic phenomena, they had proceeded to investigate\nit, and if they fonnd it calculated to support this idea they brought it\nforward. If, on the contrary, they found it inconclusive they put it\naside. In the present case an entirely different coursc had been\npursued. The Society for Psychical Research had not considered the\nwhole Theosophical position, but only certain incidents. 1'he\nimportant point in a matter of this kind was to prove the\nexistence of occult power. The value of a single item of positive evi-\ndence was not impaired by any amount of negative evidence. Mr.\nHodgson had collected with great care a nst amount of negative\nevidence, which in his (Mr. Sinnett's) opinion was of exceedingly small\nvalue. Mr. Sinnett, speaking for himself and others, said that they had\nstudied occurrences of the kind treated of for many more years than Mr.\nHodgson had months. Mr. Hodgson had undertaken his inquiry,\nmoreover, under disadvantageous circumstances, when the group of\npersons at the headquarters of the Society had been demoralised by the\nlong absence of their leaders. He had no experience of Indil~ to guide\nhim in conducting a difficult investigation with natives concerned.\nThe series of events examined in a case like this was not to he tested\nby the weakest, as a chain was tested by the strength of its\nweakest link, but the question whether psychic agency really\nentered into the matter should be determined by reference\nto the most important and conclusive incidents. He ventured\nto say that in many of the cases he could bring forward no\nelements of suspicion could be found. He considered that Mr. Hodg-\nson had proceeded on a totally wrong principle. A large quantity of\nmiscellaneous evidence had been given by persons whose statements\nDigitized by Google\n\fJuly, 1885.] Journal Qf Society for P8ychical Re8earch. 455\nwere of no value, and who were in the position of servants. Mr. Sinnett\nthen went on to speak of the \" court\" before which the inquiry took\nplace, and that practically prosecutor, counsel for the defence,andjudge\nwere all one and there was no cross-examination by persons representing\nopposite sides. Speaking of the Committee, Mr. Sinnett referred to its\nconstitution as not including any who by reason of being acquainted with\nor from having sufficiently studied the whole Theosophical movement\nmight have been in a position to direct its inquiries aright. He thought\ntho Committee was as little qualified to form a judgment as Mr.\nI Hodgson himself. As he was not able to be at th,; previous meeting, he\nmight perhaps be allowed to refer to the report of its proceedings. He\nthought many of the conclusions drawn were wholly unsupported.\nReference was made to the position taken by the editor of the Ckristian\nCollege Magazine, who was commended for having performed a delicate\ntask with much tact and temper. In reality the editor in question had\npaid money to obtain the letters which he employed as a weapon against\nthe Theosophical mo.ement. Coming to the question of hand-\nwriting, Mr. Sinnett said that he now learned with great\npleasure that the experts had given an opinion to the effect that\nthe .so-called \"Koot H oomi handwriting\" of the letters he had\nreceived from the Mahatma was produced by Madame Biavatsky.\nHe was glad of this because it was a reductio ad absurdum\nof the argument derived from the opinion of the experts to the effect\nthat the letters alleged to have been written by Madame BJavatsky to\nMadame Coulomb were genuine. This declaration had been the subject\nof much concern and bewilderment for Theosophists at first, but it was\nnow retrospectively discredited by the present opinion about the Koot\nHoomi handwriting. There were great masses of letters in that hand-\nwriting in his possession, and a large part of this correspondence had\nbeen seen by many persons besides himself. He believed that all these\npersons would agree with him in regarding the hypothesis that the con-\ntents of these letters had emanated from Madame Blavatsky as\nabsolutely grotesque in its extravagance. No caligraphic evidence in\nsuch a matter would have weight for anyone who might fairly take into\nconsideration the substance of such letters. In conclusion, he\nargued that the report now brought forward dealt exclusively with\nmechanical details of certain phenomena connected with the Thosophi-\ncal movement. It was impossible to solve the questions before thew.\nwithout paying attention to the character of the mOVE:ment in its\nhigher aspects. The psychic phenomena. with which the movement had\nl)6en associated were of merely collateral interest. By the philosophical\nteaching of which the Theosophical Society had been the channel, light\nhad been thrown upon the inner meaning of a great mass of Indian\nliterature which, now that it was thus interpreted, was seen to bear\nDigitized by Google\n\f456 Jou,'llol Qf Soejetg for P8!1cMcal RC8carclt. [Jllly, 1885:\nout the theory of Nature that had been. introduced to the world by\nmeans of the Theosophical Society as the Esoteric Doctrine. The great\nvalue of the work thus accomplished had been very widely recognised,\nand whate,'er gratitude was due for the benefits conferred on modern\nthinking in this way, was due primarily to Madame Blavatsky, through\nwhom the results had been attained. Whatever might now be alleged in\nregard to the matters Mr. Hodgson thought he had investigated, no\none could deny that Madame Blavatsky had devoted a life which might\nhave been spent in an easy and honourable station,to the ser';ice of the\ncause which the philosophical achievements of the Theosophical Society\nrepresented, and her whole career was thus a demonstration of the fun-\ndamental nobility of her character.\nThe Chairman said that there were one or two points in Mr.\nSinnett's speech to which he felt bound briefly to reply. Mr. Sinnett\nhad made a strong point of the supposed fact that the editors of the\nCI,riatio.n College Magazine had bougl\/J, the Blavatsky letters from the\nOoulombs, as though they had been thus tempted to make the most of\na costly purchase, and to insist unduly on the importance of the\nletters. In saying this, Mr. Sinnett could hardly have been cognisant\nof a passage in the CI,ristio.n College Magazine for April last (which\n.the Chairman now read to the meet.ing), in which the editors explicitly\ndenied having bought the letters, and stated, on the contrary, that the\nletters had been lent to:them by the Coulombs without any conditions,\nexcept that they should be ultimately returned. The editors distinctly\nsta.ted that from first to last they had paid the Coulombs only 150\nrupees, that being about the ordinary rate of remuneration for copying\nand other actual work done by them.\nAgain, Mr. Sinnett had urged that tho Committee, before\ninvestigating the more dubious phenomena, should have paid atten-\ntion to what he cOllsidered as the conclusive and indisputable\nphenomena which showed Madame Blavatsky's power over nature\nwithout a doubt. But this was precisely what the Committee had\ndone. Beforc Mr. Hodgson's visit to India was resolved upon, the\n90mmittee had expressly invited the attendance of any Theosophists\nwho had striking phenomena to recount, and had caused their depositions\nto be taken down by a. shorthand writer, and afterwards printed for\nconsideration. Colonel Olcott, Mr. Mohini, and Mr. Sinnett himself,\nhad\u00b7 in fact responded to this invitation, and a great mass of evidence\ngiven by them had been printed. All this evidence, as well as all the\nevidence that already existed in print, had beep most carefully weighed\nby the Committee, with the result that they had, in an ad interim\nand provisional report, expressed their conclusion that a primA, facie\ncase for further investigation existed, and had recommended that such\ninvestigation should be pursued in India. The Committee had thus done\nDigitized by Google\n\f.July, 1885.] Journal qf Sociei;1J for Psycltical ReRcm\u00b7cH\u2022 457\nprecisely what Mr. Sinnett urged that they ought to have done. The\nonly difference between Mr. Sinnett's view and the Committee's was as\nregards the absolute value of the \u00b7evidence supplied by himself and\nothers. The Committee, while showing by their subsequent action that\nthey attached Bome value to these accounts, were quite unable to\nconsider them as so conclusive and irrefragable as Mr. Sinnett and his\nfriends appeared to do. On the contrary, they saw various weak points\nin even the strongest parts of the evidence; and the results of Mr.\nHodgson's visit to India had in several particulars confirmed the\nsuspicions which the examination-in-chief of the primary witnesses had\nitself excited.\nMr. Sinnett had spoken of Mr. Hodgson's scrutiny as though it had\nnot embraced the whole field of the phenomena. The field covered by\nthe Blavatsky-Coulomb letters was surely wide enough, and he (the\nChairman) would much like to know by whom Mr. Sinnett and his\nfriends now supposed 'those letters to have been written 1 The only\nhypothesis of which he had heard on the side of the defence was that\nthe letters had been written by'\" black magicians.\" Now he was\nprepared, as a Psychical Researcher, to keep his mind open to a variety\nof strange hypotheses; but if he were called upon seriously to suppose\nthat a whole series of letters,-which according to all human canons of\nevidence were in the handwriting of a well-known person, correspondecl\nwith her circumstances, and expressed her character,-to be in effect\nthe work of a blacle magician, he should retire in despair from tho task\nof endeavouring to get at any truth in a region so remote from the laws\nof ordinary human intelligence. He begged to call on Mr. Mohini for\nany remarks which he might be disposed to make.\nMr. Mohini, in responding to the Chairman's invitation, complained\nof the method adopted in taking evidence both in India and here. All\ndetails regarding paenomenal occurrences were elicited by :)ross-\nquestionings by those who were utterly ignorant of the times and places\nof thosp. occurrences. Upon this information, necessarily ohscure, Mr.\nHodgson proceeded in his investigation, and considered himself justified\nin rejecting evidence whose chief defect was a want of precision which\nought not to have been expected. Regarding Dr. Hartmann's contra-\ndictory statements, there was no reason for preferring the earlier to the\nlater one. For if Dr. Hartmann was capable of a falsehood there was\nnothing to prevent him from using it as the means of separating\nphilosophical doctrines from phenomenalism with which it had been\nillogically mixed up. He emphatically protested against the course\nMr. Hodgson had taken in attacking a dead man on hearsay evidence,\nas he did when he stated that l\\fulji Thackersy confessed on his death-\nbed to having told lies at the instigation of Madame Blavatsky. Then,\nagain, he would draw attention to the fact that Mr. Hodgson lleYCr\n\f458 Jom'nal flf Societ!1 for- PS!lchicfll Rellea1\u00b7cll.. rJuly,l885.\nsaw the Shrine, and that the drawings he had shown were made from\ninformation given him by the Coulombs. In his opinion, Mr. Hodgson\nhad brought forward much 'that -he had not proved. In fact, Mr.\nHodgson had examined how far the statements of the Coulombs were\ntrue, and not how far the phenomena were genuine. He had put\nforward the statement of the Coulombs as to the surreptitious introducr\ntion of letters through crevices in the ceiling, because he found some of\nthese crevices filled up in the way described by the Coul\u00bbmbs. :Mr.\nHodgson had accepted what the lawyers would call mere matters of\nprejudice as good evidence. It was unnecessary to go into details.\nThe special difIh,ulties of investigations of this kind were well known to\nthose who ha.d inquired into the phenomena of Spiritualism, and to\nthese difficultie3 no attention had been paid. The Committee had\nentirely ignored evidence resting upon the abnormal experience of\npsychics. The Committee had entirely ignored subjective evidence.\nThis would not have been surprising if the inquirers had been\nmaterialistic mell of science. But the Committee either did or did not\nbelieve in psychic experience. If they did, he did not consider their\nconclusions fair to themselves. For his part he thought many questions\nmust still be left open, and for many reasons he did not believe that\nMadame Blavatsky wrote the Coulomb letters. Other explanations\nwere possil>le. Unquestionahle cases of abnormal production of people's\nhandwritin,g had occurred within the experience of inquirers into\nSpiritualism. This was the black magic to which reference had been\nmade by the Chairman. He should be glad to know if Mr. Hodgson\nshowed the Coulomb.Blavatsky letters to l\\-Iadame Blavatsky herself.\nProfessor Sidgwick remarked that Mr. Sinnett's eomplaint that the\nCommittee included none of the persons who were already committed\nto the genuineness of the phenomena, could hardly be seriously enter-\ntained.\nMrs. Macdonald, who described herself as only a student in theso\nmatters, thought Theosophy had much to answer for, in having given\nfalse views of Buddhism, and for having turned away the attention\nof so many from the beautiful philosophy and teaching of the older\nwritings.\nMr. Keightley and Mr. Henslow having made some brief remarks,\nMr. G. P. Bidder said he had listened with care to Mr. Sinnett and Mr.\nMohini, but he had heard no answer to the report of Mr. Hodgson as\nto the facts. He could not at all agree with what Mr. Sinnett said as\nto the course which had been pursued by the Society. The first thing\nto be done was to sift the phenomena. This was what was done in\nother branches of the Society'S work. Nor could he f.:>llow Mr. Sinnett's\nargument as to thp. value of the wt)akest links in a chain of this kind.\nIf it were found that a certain portion of the phcnomena were tainted\n. DigitizedbyGoogle\n\fJuly, 1885.] Journal Cit Society fo\/' PsychICal Re.~e(lrc!t. 459\nwith fraud, the greatest possible doubt is thrown on the remainder.\nHe could not conceive that those who were conscious of the power of\nproducing phenomena by genuine means should have recourse to fraud.\nHe thought that any impartial person carefully reading the reportswhich\nthe Committee made last year would come to very similar conclusions to\nthose at which Mr. Hodgson has arrived. Mr. Bidder proceeded, in\nsupport of this view, to refer to two instances in particular, viz., the\nfalling of a letter referred to in p. 57 of the Report, and the instance\nof the appearmlce of Mr. Damodar to Mr. Ewen in London.\nProfessor Barrett defended the strictly scientific position which the\nSociety had taken. As presenting somewhat of an analogy he referred\nto papers in the early history of the Royal Society, some of which\nconsisted largely of what might be called negative evidence, but which\nwere of value in clearing the ground, and in leading to subsequent\npositive results.\nMr. Hodgson, in replying, agreed with much that Mr. Sinnett\nhad said conceming the value of psychical phenomena on the\nhigher planes, but joined issue with him as to the value of the\nphenomena connected with the Theosophical Society. Mr. Sinnett\nhad offered no specific reply whatever to tIle charges which had\nbeen brought against these phenQIDena, except to say that the Report\nlargely depended upon the statements made by the Coulombs. This\nwas quite contrary to the fact, as he had in no case relied upon the evi-\ndence given by the Coulombs, though he had found all their essential\nstatements corroborated hy independent evidence. In reply to the chief\nstatements made by Mr. Mohini, he said that whether Dr. Hartmann's\nfinal statement concerning the destruction of the Shrine was true or not,\nmade no differen6e to the results of the investigation; but that the\nShrine had disappeared, and the explanation offerlJd by Dr. Hartmann\nwas the only one forthcoming. If, as Mr. Mohini apparently suggested,\nDr. Hartmann's last statements concerning the Shrine were false, then\none of theleading Theosophists at headquarters was still taking part in\ndeliberate dishonesty. He had not depended upon the decision of\ncaligraphic experts alone in the question of the Blavatsky-Coulomb\ndocuments; he had examined carefully the circumstantial evidence\noffered by Theosophists, and had questioned Madame Blavatsky herself\nat great length upon the letters and statements printed in Madame\nCoulomb's pamphlet. Nor was it true that the diagrams exhibited\nwere given by the Coulombs. Nearly all the drawings exhibited\nhad been enlarged from sketches which depended on measure-\nments made by himself.

[July, 1885.\nThe Chairman, in a. few concluding remarks, said that he trusted\nthat the meeting would not separate with the impression that the Com-\nmittee of the Society for Psychical Research were in any way disposed\nto feel exultation in the exposure of the frauds involved in these\nphenomena, or antagonism of any kind towards those who might still cling\nto some kind of belief in them. Their feeling, if feeling might be alluded\nto in a discussion which turned entirely upon evidence to facts, was one\nof disappointment at the closure of what had seemed a. possible avenue\ntowards the attainment of !IO~e of that further knowledge of the ~rets\nof the universe which Theosophists and members of the Society for\nPsychical Research desired with equal earnestness, though it might be\nwith somewhat different standards of proof. Most assuredly there was\nno touch of triumpl, on the one side, and he eanlestly trusted that there\nwould be no touch of resentment on the other, but that all should still\nfeel themselves united by a disinterested love of truth.\nA CONFERENCE.\nOn the invitation of Professor Barrett, SOUle members of the Society\nfor Psychical Research beld an infonnal conference, at 14, Dean's Yard,\non the 9th inst. Professor Balfour Stewart presided, and among those\npresent were Mr. Pearsall Smitb, of Philadelphia, the Hon. Percy\nWYlldham, M.P., Mr. R H. Hutton, and Professor Lodge. The chief\nsubject of discussion was the imporlance of securing the extension of\nexperimental work, especially in thought-transference, and of enlisting\nthe further aid of Members and Associates. The result of the views\nexpressed was embodied in a series of resolutions, which were sub-\nstantiallyadopted by the Council at its Meeting on the following day.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe last Genel'al Meeting of the Society for the present season was\nheld on the evening of Friday, the 10th inst., at the Suffolk Street\nRooms.\nThe President took the chair, and in his opening address he gave a\nsketch of the experimental work which has been done during the last\nfew years in the su~ject of Thought-transference, and strongly insisted\non the importance of seeking for fresh\" subjects.\"\nMr. Edmund Gurney made some remarks on \"Retractations and\nAlterations of View,\" which will appear in the next Journal.\nMr. Malcolm Guthrie, J.P., then read an account of some further\nexperiments 011 the transference of ideas and sensations, conducted\nduring the last year with one of his fonner subjects, Miss R.\nThe President made a few remarks on one very interesting and im-\nportant featul'e which Mr. Guthrie had described; namely, the tiTl&8\nDigitized by Google\n\f.July, 1885.] Journal of Societ!l for PIJ!lcltical Rellearch. 461\nwhich appeared to be nec6.'lSary in some cases for the impression to\nassume a definite form. He called upon Professor Barrett for some\nremarks.\nProfessor Barrett said that the same thing had been remarked in\nsome of the former series of experiments. He had sometimes found\nthat the image would float up again, as it were, when the attention of\nthe mimI had gone into something else. For instance, a name thought\nof by the agent had produced apparently no effect on the percipient.\nSome little time afterwards, when another matter was in hand, the per-\ncipient had suddenly said, \" Oh, was the name so and so 1\" giving the\nright one.\nThe same feature had been strikingly observed in some of Mr. M.\nGuthrie's experiments in the transference of tastes. Salad oil, Worces-\ntershire sauce, and bitter aloes being successively tasted by th(' agent,\nthe percipient did not describe the salad oil until the agent was tasting\nthe Worcestershire sauce; and the taste of the Worcestershire sauce\nwas only perceivedwhen the agent had gone on to bitter aloes.\nThe President referred to the frequent occurrence of being unable\nby mental effort to call up a familiar name, which afterwards rose up\nspontaneously when the attention was turned in another direction.\nDr. Guthrie said he should like to testify to the extreme care with\nwhich his cousin, Mr. Malcolm Guthrie, had conducted his experiments.\nOn one occasion, when he himself had been present, the conditions were\nnot s11ch as to allow him to come ~ an absolute con~lusion, and he had\nnot had the opportunity of pursuing the subject in a way which would\nentitle him to express any personal opinion on so important a question;\nbut as to his relative's thoroughly scientific mode of conducting the\nwork he had no doubts.\nThe Meeting then assumed a conversational character.\nThe following letter from Mr. Sinnett relates'to the discussion that\ntook place at the General Meeting on June 26th :-\nTo THE EDITOR OF THE JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYClIICAL RESEARCH.\nSIR,-Time did not allow me at the meeting of the 26th to answer certain\ncomments on my remarks made by subsequent speakers. May I ask your\npermission to add a few observations to any report of the proceedings you\nmay publish? I never supposed or hinted that any sum of money had been\ngiven for the letters, by the editor of the Cht-istia-n College Magazine, that\nwould be considered large by prosperous people in this country. But the\n150 rupees actually paid, according to Mr. Myers' statement, would be an\nimportant payment amongst the people concerned. The letters wero not the\nless bought because the originals may have been returned to the Coulomhs\nafter they were printed. Their publication in the magazine was the result\nDigitized by Google\n\f462 JOItr\/lalof Snciet!\/ for Pst\/cllicat Researcn., [July. 1885.\npaid for, and under the circumst:l.nces it would be 11. mistake to overlook the\nfact that they were purchased weapons in the fierce paper war which rages\nin l\\ladrns between the missionaries and the Theosophists.\nAs to the view taken by Mr. Myers of the Committee's action, it appears\nto me that the prima facie case for believing that Madame Blavatsky has in\nsome cases shown true psychic power, which he recognises as having been\nestablished by the examination of the witnessell in London, is not touched\nby the examination of other witnesses concerning other transactions in India.\nThe examination in chief of A. by B. at one time and place is not efficiently\ncrossed by an examination of C. ca.rried on by D. at a totally different time\nand place. It is just because in this way Mr. Hodgson's investigations have\nnot groWn in any legitimate way out of the incidents to which they attach\nimportance that Theosophists genera.lly seem to put Ius results aside as\n.rrelevant; for those of us who have an intimate knowledge of the places\nand people concerned. they are discredited in otller ways.\nProfessor Sidgwick thought my objection to the composition of the\nCommittee disposed of by regarding the Committee as a tribunal which ought\nnot to include members committed to definite opinions on the question to be\ntried. But that was liot the position occupied by the Committee. It was\nnot a tribunal, for it never had to face any representatives of the accused\npersons whom it affectEKl to try. Its evidence was collected in secret by\none of its own number, whose present attitude, at a.ll events, is very\ndecidedly antagonistic to the persons whose conduct is being investigated.\nIts views have been formed in a consultation which has not been assisted\nby the suggestions of anyone whose sympathies would render him a.n\nefficient critic of Mr. Hodgson's Report. I think I am not exaggerating the\ngeneral opinion of the London Lodge of the Theosophical Society, in\nassuring you that for these and other reasons we regard the methods by\nwhich this illvestigation has been carried out as altogether vitiating its\nresults.\n~Ir. Bidder hardly seemed to catcb my meaning about the principles on\nwhich psychic inquiry should be conducted. If the question was, \"Is\nMadame Blava.tBky's character immaculate 1\" then we should address our-\nselves to incidents that suggest suspicion. If the question is, \"Are psycHo\nphenomena possible 1\" it is wise to examinine the facts which seem to\nsuggest that conclusion, in preference to those which do not promise to\nafford evidence for it.\nPermit me, in conclusion, heartily to reciprocate the feeling which Mr.\nMyers so admirably conveyed in his concluding remarks.\nYours very truly,\nA. P. Sn.\"NETr.\nMr. Sinnott's lotter gi\\'es me an opportunity of olearing up some\nmisapprehensions, under which he seems still to labour, both as to the\naction of the Committee and as to the grounds on which it has been b~d.\nI must begin by saying that I do not quite understand his argument as to\nthe money paid by the editor of the Chrilltia'J CoUege Magazlne for the\nBla.\\\u00b7atsky-Coulomb letters. Had he maintained that a large sum had been\ngiven for them, I should have supposed that lle was attacking the editor on\nDigitized by Google\n\fJuly, 1835.] Journal qf 8ociet!l.for PS.llcltical Re-search. 463\nthe' ground of the somewhat difficult ethical question as to how far it is\njustifiable to bribe impostors to betray their accomplice. But since it is not\ndenied that the payment was on the ordinary scale for work done for the\nmagazine, I fail to see what ground of attack there is. The opinion of Mr.\nMyers as to the tact and temper shown by the editor is founded, I believe.\non the moderate tone of the articles that have appeared in the magazine on\nthe subject; and I think that all impartial persons who read these articles\nand consider the strength of the case in the editor's ha.nds against a bitter\nenemy to the' cause he represents, will agree with him in this view.\nPerhaps, however, the object of Mr. Sinnett's remarks is not so much\nto attack the editor of the Ohri.sticm Oollege M Qga.:ilte for giving work and\nwages to the Coulombs, but rather to depreciate the trustworthiness of the\nrecipients of the wages. If so, it is sufficient to say th:1.t no part of the\nconclusions, eitherof the Committee orof Mr. Hodgson, rest in any degree\n011 the assumption that the Coulombs are trustworthy witnesses.\nWith regard to the second question discussed in Mr. Sinnett's letter, I\nthink that he understands the expression pl'imd facie case in a different sense\nfrom that in which it was USE'd by Mr. Myers and the Committee. We do not\nregard the establislmlent of ILpl'imdfacie case as implying a definite con-\nclusion that certain phenomena were genuine, but only as a rel1.8on for in-\nvestigating further. Moreover, we considered this ca.se to rest, RO far 11.8 the\nIndian phenomena were concerned, chiefly on the testimony of certn.in na.tive\nwitnesses who were not available for examination in London. As re-\ngards phenomena experienced in India by Mr. Mohini, Mr. Sinnett, Colonel\nOlcott, and the greaLcr number of witnesses, English and Indian, we did not\nconsider that it had been shown that they could not have been deceived by a\ncombination between Madame Blavatsky, the Coulombs, and s~rvants. We\nthought it possible, however, that our views onthese points might be modified\nif, through ono of our number, we could obtain that knowledge of ..times and\nplaces\" which, 11.8 Mr. Mohinijustly remarks, we did not possoss. Mr. Hodg-\nson accordingly went out to India with instructions to examine,\nand 1l3.ve examined by experts, the BIavatsky\u00b7Coulomb letters; to I1.8ce1\"-\ntain, so far 11.8 possible, the dE'.gree of value that was to be attached to\nthe statements of certain important native witnesses; and to examine\nlocalities and witnesses with a view to ascertaining whether various pheno-\nmena, such as the faIling of letters from the ceiling, and appearances of\nMall3.tmas, could be accounted for by fraud in the ways that had suggested\nthemselves to the members of the Committee, or in other ways. This, Mr.\nHodgson has done, and the Committee, with the results of his investigation\nbefore them, have arrived at the conviction that their primd facie case has\nbroken down; a conviction, it may again be stated, which in no degree\ndepends on the assertions of the Coulombs. I find it difficult, therefore, to\nunderstand why Mr. Sinnett should consider that\"Mr.. Hodgson's investiga-\ntions have not grown in any legitimate way out of the incidents to which\nTheosophists attach importance.\" His impression on this point may possibly\nbe due to the fact that Mr. Hodgson's Report has as yet been only laid\nbefore the Society in a fragmentary and incomplete form. If so, the\nmatter will be much clearer when this report is published in full in the\nnext number of the Society's Proceedings. But I cannot so account\nDigitized by Google\n\f464 JOllrnalof SfJCiel!l for PS!lckical Researcli. [Jllly, 18Sli.\nfor Mr. Sinnett's asaertion \"that Theosophists generally seem to put Mr.\nHodgson's results aside as irrelevant.\" If they put aside as irrelevant the\nwhole of the cumulative argument by which. Mr. Hodgson has supported\nhis conclusions, (1) that the Blavatsky.Coulomb letters are genuine, and,\n(2) that the Shrine at Adyar was constructed and used for the production\nof spurious phenomena,:..-.then it is difficult indeed to conceive the kind and\ndegree of evidence that would induce them to abandon their confiding\nattitude.\nFinally, Mr. Sinnett repeats in a modified form his objeCtions to the\nconstitution of the Committee. His complaint now is that the Committee\ndid not contain any person adequately in sympathy with the Theosophic\nview of things. It must, I think, be obvious that any objection of this kind\nought to have been raised, if at all, when the Committee was first constituted\nmore than a year ago, and not now, afterit has reported unfavourably on the\nTheosophic marvels. But I need not press this point, for I have no fear that\nMr. Sinnett's complaint will be regarded as well founded by any impartial\nreader of our First Report. I am much more afraid that most sensible per-\nsons will criticize our action from the opposite point of view, and will consider\nthat with the evidence which was even then before ns of trickery on the part\nof Madame Blavatsky, we were hardly justified in the expenditure of time\nand trouble involved in our Indian investigation. To this criticism my\nanswer would be that we did not regard ourselves-as Mr. Sinnett seems to\nsuppose-as a \"tribunal\" to try the question\" whether Madame Blavatsky's\ncharacter is imml\\Culate.\" The question we had to deal with was both wider\nand more difficult; we had to consider whether any part of the whole mass\nof evidence offered in connection with Theosophy could be made available\nfor the establishment of any of the psychical laws hitherto unrecognised by .\nscience, which it is our function to investigate. The negative conclusion at\nwhich we have arrived on this point is one which we were bound to state\nwith perfect unreserve; but we have no right and no desire to caJl on the\nmembers of our Society to accept it merely on our authority. The evidence\non which it is based will be shortly placed before all who are interested in\nthe question; and if, after roading it, any member of the Society should\nstill think it a profitable pursuit to fish for \"psychical\" phenomena in these\ntroubled waters, it is perfectly open to him to do so, and to bring his results\nbefore us.\nThere is one other point in Mr. Sinnett's letter to which I must refer.\nHe speaks of Mr. Hodgson's evidence as \"collected in secret.\" It seems,\ntherefore, worth while to state that we took care to make it known to all\nconcerned that Mr. Hodgson had gone to India to collect this evidence\non behalf of our Society; and that his unfavourable view of the evidence\nwas communicated to the lea.ding Theosophists at Madras, before his\ndeparture from India..\nH.

'\nSIR,-The article under the above heading, in the June number of\nthe Journal, is of so much interest in relation to the question of evidence\nof \"occult\" phenomena, that I hope you will allow it to be subjected to\nsome examination; which is the more desirable as thtl argument of the\narticle is extremely specious, and is likely to be accepted without re-\nserve by those who have not already considered the subject from &\nsomewhat different point of view.\nWith regard to the first point, the confusion of moral with physical\nevidence, I have nothing to object, nor have I ever seen thejustification\nof tests in the medium's own interest better stated. Testimony to\ncharacter is mere opinion, and is so treated-though admitted for\nthe defence-in criminal trials. It can have no place as evidence in\nstri'}tly scientific investigations.\nBut I feel more difficulty in assenting to the proposition as to the\nonus probandi in its application to the \"margins\" claimed for known\nphysical agency. No doubt, in the physical agency we have a vera\ncausa, and we are not entjtled to resort to hypothetical causation for\nany effect to which the former is adequate. But there is a legitimate\napriori presumption against the adequacy of a physical cause to any\neffect which it has never been known to produce apart from the disputed\ncase; while the presumption against a new or unknown agency arises\nonly from the absence of facts requiring it. It is not necessary to con-\ntend that any such other agency is at once proved; only that a prima\nfacie case for it is established, and the onus probandi shifted. This\nshifting of the burden of proof in the course of evidence is of frequent\nexperience in courts of law,while on the main issue, of course, it remains\ntrue that this burden is ou the plaintiff. So, I conceive, in scientific re-\nsearch a fact greatly exceeding former experience would at once put the\nexperimenter on a re\u00b7testing the capabilities of his known agencies, that\nhe might not have to suspect the existence of an unknown one. He would\nnot anticipate this, unless the disproportion between the old known\ncapabilities and the new observation were very great, but he would not\nfeel justified in making presumptions which would dispense with trial.\nHe would recognise a fact not yet actually accounted for.\nAnd still more, I submit, must this be the case when the known\nlesser capability of. the recognised agency is itself of exceptional\noccurrence, that is, under rare and peculiar conditions; when it was\nitself .opposed, in the first instance, to legitimate presumptions of what\nDigitized by Google\n\f\u00b7466 JOIl1\"nal qf Society.for PS,IIcltical Researclt. [July. 18M.\nwas possible. For the margin justifiably claimed for the possible may\nfairly he said to have been exhausted when we got the originally\nimprobahle. At first, we should require demonstration before accepting\nthe alleged fact that a hand could be squeezed through a rigid circum-\nference in any very appreciable degree less than its own. If we get the\ndemonstration, but only for a very few exceptional hands, the positive\npresumption against a much greater squeezability is then increased by\nthe rarity of the easier case.\nBut the question now at issue-on whom is the burden of proof in\nsuch a case-may be tested in another way. Suppose that there was\nno suggestion of any other than the known physical agency, but that it\n\u00b7WM important to ascertain whether a phenomenon alleged to hll\"e\nhappened by means of it really had happened at all, it being one greatly\nin excess of all former experience, yet ejusdem generis with former\nexperience. Would not den:.onstration be required as the condition of\nbelief1 But why, unless for the r!'.a.son that we declined to lJreSU}JPose\nsuch a margin of possibility as would be necessary for the phenomE'non\nalleged 1 On what ground, then, do we allow the presupposition when,\nthe fact being admitted, the only question is between an ageney not\notherwise proved to be adequate and an agency not otherwise proved to\nexist 1 Yet if the presupposition is not made, the fact is unexplained\nuntil and unless we get positive proof aliter that our known agency is\n\u00b7adequate to it.\nThe\" Spiritualist,\" then, I submit, hilS got thus fa.r on his way in\nthe particular case, excluding, of course, all other experienee which\nwould tend to establish the agency he affirms as a vera causa. He has\nnot, indeed, shown positively and certainly that his fact is inexplicable\nby the physical agency, except for those who reject the doctrine of very\nlarge \"margins\" altogether, or at least in such cases. But he\nhas established a strong prima facie case. He has put us to\nthe alternative of showing that the physical agency is adequate,\n\u00b7or of admitting that his fact remains simply unexplained posi-\ntively. He hM only got to prove the negative up to the point\nwhere adverse probabilities on the physical side come to his aid.\nThose probabilities, adverse to the physical agency, are not less\n.now, because the fact to be explained is admitted, than they would\nhave been had the fact itself been disputed. They ere not less now,\nbecause we are face to faee with an alternative hypothesis of causation,\nthan they would have been if the alternative had merely been the\nunveracityof a witness.\nIf there is a fallacy in this reasoning, it will, no doubt, be detected\nand pointed out by the\u00b7.able contributor whose proposition I have\nventured to question.\nC.O.M.\nDigitized by Coog\n\fJuly, 1885.] Journal of Soeiet,1J for PsycMcal Re8earcl,.\u2022 467\nPREDICTION OF RECOVERY IN MESMERIC TRANCE.\nThe following case is translated from communications in Ft'ench sent\nto us by Dr. Nicolas, Count Gontlmys, of Corfu. His MS., which con-\ntains further theoretical discussion of clairvoyance, may be had on loan\nby application to the secretary.\nIn a former paper I had the pleasure of describing to my readers II. cure,\nwhich I succeeded in effecting in the year 1869, when I was attached to the\ngarrison of Zante. To-day I am going to tell you of another, which I per-\nformed in the same year, and which, on account of some singular circum-\nstances connected with it, was of peculiar interest to all concerned, and\nwon for me considerable fame in the neighbourhood in which I then\nresided. My patient, in this case, was a girl of about 20, named\nDenise Zyros, who, since the age of 14, had suffered from that form\n()f hysteria which is generally known by the name of hysterical melancholia.\nEvery kind of treatment during these eight years had been tried for her in\n. vain; the doctors at last pronounced her case hopeless; and the parents could\n.()nly try to reconcile themselves to the fact that their daughter was incurable.\nThe poor girl for years had ceased to exist as an animal being ;she seemed\nsimply to vegetate, and, but for a few unconnected words which she some-\ntimes muttered in a low voice, one would have supposed every spark of\nreason in her to have been extinct. Sitting in a chair with closed eyes and\nbent head, she appeared utterly unconscious of all that took place around\nher. She had even forgotten how to eat and drink, so that to sustain life\nher parents were obliged to force open her jaws and compel her to swallow a\nfew mouthfuls of some nutritious subst8.nce. Although, apparently, she was\nno longer in pain, yet a continuous trembling of the whole body was observ-\na.ble; her eyelids when raised showed only the whites of the eyes, the cornea\nbeing lost in the sockets. From all information I could obtain as to\nthe girl's former state of health, I was confirmed in my opinion that this was\n.a severe case of melancholia, and one, indeed, tlmt was rapidly drawing near\nits closing scene. I made a thorough examination of the case and was un-\nable to discover a trace of anything radically wrong in the organic system.\nThis examination took place on the 29th ofJ uly,and on that day I mesmerised\nher for the first time. In the course of half-an-hour she fell into a deep sleep,\nwhich sleep was preceded by a relaxation of the limbs, a cessation of the\nusual trembling, and of the habitual low murmuring. I let her sleep for an\nhour, and as I saw no change in her expression during that time, I thought\nit better not to disturb her by addressing her. I certainly had not expected\nto produce so quick an effect on an organism which, one may almost say, had\nlostall right of domicile in this physical. world, so utterly insensible was it to\nall surrounding agents.\nThe next day I mesmerised her again, and this time she not only went\nto sleep as she had done the previous evening, but she even became clair-\nvoyante. She told me she was sleeping, and that she saw a dazzling light\nwhich emanated from my eyes and fingers, and which thrilled her whole body.\nShe asserted tha~ I should succeed in curing her'in 17 days, and more-\n()ver was able to fix the exact date of her recovery, telling me that I must\nDigitized by Google\n\f468 Journal Q\/' Societu for PS.I\/chicat Resent\u00b7cn. [July, 188.'i.\nmesmerise her twice everyday, morning and evening, and that she should\nthan be able to walk to Mass on the 15th of August-which would be the\nFeast of the Assumption-accompanied by her brother, all of which facts did\nactually take place precisely as she had predicted. When I left my\npatient, after first awakening her, I happened to g'> down to the dispensary,\nwhere I found several doctors and other persons assembled. I turned to\nthe former, and asked them if they were acquainted with the case of the\nafHicted girl Zyros. They replie1 that they knew her well, that they had used\nevery means in their power to bring about her recovery, and that they had\neventually given up her case as hopeless. I wId them that I believed them to\nbe mistaken in their opinion, that in 17 days she would be able to go\nout, thatshe would be completely cured, and that they might see herat Mass\non the Feast of the Assumption. They all burst out laughing at this un-\nexpectedassertion, and unanimously agreed that I must be out of my senses.\nGossip spreads quickly in a small town, and in a short time this affair became\nthe subject of general talk in Zante. Opinions varied greatly. Some called\nme a quack and a:humbug, whilst others were inclined to exalt me to the\nskies; in fact publio opinion seemed to know no happy mean.\nMeanwhile I continued to mesmerise my patient morning and evening,\nand found her improving in health daily. At last the 15th of August, the\nmuch-talked of day, arrived. The cathedral bell announced to the faithful\nthe Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, and a orowd collected round the\nZyros' house to see Denise walk to church ~r rather to see the quack\nunmasked I What, then, was their astonishment to see the girl presently\nwalk downstairs, and appear amongst them in perfect health and good spirits.\nThe crowd was electrified; a loud \"hurrah\" was heard on all sides ; whilst\nI, putting her arm in mine, led her victoriously towards the church, followed\nby all the bystanders, who cheered us vociferously.\nFrom that date, I am confidently able to affirm that the girl has continued\nin good health.\nI do not pretend for a moment to be a partisan of those demonological\nideas which must have inspired St. Augustine when he wrote his \"Civitas\nDei.\" At the Banle time, I feel bound to state openly all that I obsorved in\nthis case, without deducing from it any conclusions, which might be pre-\nmature in the present undeveloped state of physiological and psychological\nscience.\nThe third time I mesmerised the girl, as soon as my influence acted on\nthe nerVOUR system, and even before she was asleep, a great ohange in her\nwas observable. Her eyes opened wide, she made hideous grimaces, and\nused exce88ively coarse language. She defied my mesmeric power, and\nattempted by such violent efforts and contortiolJs to oppose my actions, that\nI was obliged to tie her down. As soon, however, as she had fallen into &\nmesmeric sleep, she would cry bitterly, and excuse herself for what she had\njust said by assuring me that it was not she who had previously spoken.\nNow, we have here before us a case of partial clairvoyance-. clair-\nvoyance, that is to say, relating solely to the patient's own recovery. We\nknow that she had been living for many years ill total mental obscurity;\nthat she had lost all idea of time, and all consciousne88 of outward events ;\nwe must, therefore, it seems to me, make a distinction between the two\nDigitized by Google\n\fJuly, 1885.] Journal of 80ciet!\/.f01' PS!lcflicalllesearck. 469\nphenomena presented, that is to say, between her prediction as to the\nduration of her malady, and the sudden awakening of the mind to the\ncOllSciousness of time, which enabled ~r to fix the 15th of August as the\nday on which her sufferings would terminate. The first of these phenomena.\nI should call subjective, the second entirely objective. The one might be\nconnected with intuition or instinct, tile other is independent of any such\naction. It may be suggested by some that my patient was able to read my\nmind, that she learnt the day of the month from my thoughts, and was able\nconsequently to make her calculations from this given point. To this I\nreply that I was not thinking of the day of the month; that, as a matter of\nfact, I did not know whether it was the 2nd, 10th, or 20th ; neither had I\nthe least idea that the 15th of August Was the day of the Assumption. Again,\nit must be noted that no one was present at these seances. I call attention\nto this fact, to remove all suspicion from the minds of those who would say\nthat the somnambulist learnt from the bystanders the information 8ha\nrequired to enable her to fix the date of her prophecy.\nCASES RECEIVED BY THE LITERARY COMMIT,TEE.\n(Continued. )\nWe will first give two cases belonging to a qu~te distinct type-one\nwhich involves no time-coincidence at all. Evidence that certain hallucin-\nations have been telepathic,and notpurely subjective,in character may be\nafforded by a coincidenl)e of another sort-namely, that several persons,\nat different times, have had a hallucination representing the same person,\nthough that person was apparently in no abnormal state on any of the\noccasions. Clearly it would be difficult to regard a repetition of this\nsort as accidental. It being comparatively a ra~e event for a sane and\nhealthy person to see the form of an absent,person at all, that two\nor more sane and healthy persons at different times should see the form\nof the same absent person, is, on the theory of chances, so unlikely as\nto suggest a specific faculty on the absent person's part for promulgating\ntelepathic impulses.\nThe point is important from its bearing on the question whether the\npeculiarity of organisation which conduces to telepathic transferences\nbelongs rather to the percipient or to the agent.\nTo decide this question we should naturally ask which happens the\nmore frequently-that the same percipient, or that the same agent, is\nconcerned in several telepathic incidents.

One moonlight night I was sleeping in my room, and had\nbeen asleep some hl)urs when I was awakened by hearing a noise close to my\nhead, like the chinking of money. My waking ideo., therefore, was that a\nmal~ was trying to take my money out of my trousers pocket, which lay on\na chair close to the head of my bed. On opening my eyes, I was astonished\nto see a tooman, and I well remember thinking with sorrow that it must be\n()ne of our servants who was trying to take my money. I mention these two\nthoughts to show that I was not thinking in the slightest degree of my\nmcther. When my eyes had become more accustomed to the light, I was\nmore than ever surprised to see that it was my motJ&er, dressed in a peculiar\nsilver-grey dress. which she had originally got for a fancy ball. She was\nstanding with both hands stretched out in iront of her as if feeling her way,\nand in tha.t m:l.nner moved slowly away from me, passing in front of the\ndressing-t:l.ble, which stood in front of the curtained window, through which\nthe moon threw a certain amount of light. Of course my idea all this time\nwas that she was walking in her sleop. On getting beyond the table she\nwas lost to my sight in the darkness. I then sat up in bed, listening but\nhearing nothing, and on peering through the d:J.rkness saw that the door,\nwhich was at the foot of my bed, and to g'3t to which she would have had to\npau in front of the light, was still shut. I then jumped out of bed, struck\na light, and instead of finding my mother at the far end of the room. as I\nexpected, found the room empty. I then for the first time supposed that it\nwas an \"appearance,\" and greatly dreaded that it signified her death.\nI might add that I had, at that time, quite forgotten that my mother had\never appeared to anyone before, her last appea.rance having been about the\ny.mr 1847, three years before I was born.\nEDWARD HAWKINS.\nIn answer to inquiries Mr. E.

I\nhave often endeavoured to shake my wife's belief in the reality of her having\nseen what she thinks she saw. In the former case I have told her \"You\nwere only half awake and perhaps tlreaming.\" But she always confidently\nasserts that she was broa.\u00abl awake, and is quite certain that she saw me. In\nthe latter case she is equally confident.\nMy daughter also has often told me and now repeats the story, thatone\nday when living at home before her marriage she was passing my study door,\nwhich was ajar, and looked in to see if I was there. She saw me sitting in\nmy chair, and as she caught sight of me I stretched out my arms, and drew\nmy hands across my eyes, a familiar gesture of mine, it appears.

A good many\nyear ago there was a very devout young woman living in my parish who used\nto spend much of her spare time in church in meditation and prayer.

We regard all such\nhallucinations as purely lIubjective, and caused by the percipient's\nattitude of expectancy. But, of course, it is a different matter when\nthe hallucination falls at a. time when the person is actua.lly about to\narrive, but his arrival is tme;,;pected. We have a few visual cases of this\ntype, and the following auditory case. The examples are not sufficiently\nnumerous for Ull to be sure that we have in them a genuine type of tele-\npathic action.

In the month of November, I was on a visit to his house in\nHazareebagh, where he was then living with his wife; and it was then tllat\nhe told me of the apparition. As he was a man of a very unromantic,\npractical character, always ready to ridicule a ghost story, I was the more\nstruck with the depth of the impression left on his mind by the vividness of\ntile apparition, as he believed it to have been, which had led to his taking a.\nnote of the date in writing.\nHe told me that after having been asleep for a time, during tile night of\nthat date (which must have been the 7th September), he awoke, feeling the\nheat rather trying; that he saw, by a light burning in the room, the punkah\nswinging above the bed, and then saw our sister Susan standing at the foot\nof the bed, gazing at him very earnestly.
