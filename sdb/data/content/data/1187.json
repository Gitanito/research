It is therefore to be lamented\nthat the cultivation of it is become obfolete and unfafhionable; and that,\nowing to the violent difturbances at the clofe of the laft century\u2014to the\nwant of recent information on the fubjedt, and to the too refined notions\nof modern philofophers, its congenial rays have been fo long withheld\nfrom fhedding their divine light upon thefe kingdoms.\nThat an Aftrology in the Heavens does really exift, and was ordained of\nGod from the beginning of the world, for the immediate information and\ndirection of his creatures here below, is obvioufly and incontellibly proved\nfrom various parts of thofe facred Books, which contain the unerring word\nof God, and the perfedt rule of faith for every good and fober Chriftian.\u2014\nTo revive the gloomy days of fuperftition, or to impofe on the untaught\nmultitude, precepts of ignorance, is no part of the Author\u2019s defign.\u2014 His\naim is, to remove the mote from the eyes of prejudiced men; and by juft\nreafoning, and fair argument, founded on the principles of religion and\nmorality, to ihew them that God is a God of order, and created nothing in\nvain;\u2014that he framed the world by number, weight, and meafure, and\nfixed the whole fyftem of heavenly and earthly things upon fo perfedt and\nimmutable a plan, that the whole doth work harmonioufly and fympathe-\nB tically\n\f14 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\ntically together, fo as to anfwer all the various purpofes for which they\nwere firft ordained;\u2014that fuperiors do uniformly rule inferiors j and that\nceleftial bodies fenfibly adt upon and influence all earthly fubftances, whe\u00ad\nther animal, vegetable, or mineral; not by chance or accident, but by a\nregular inherent caufe, implanted in them from the beginning, by the om\u00ad\nnipotence of God.\nIt is a maxim with perfons of a contumacious turn of mind, to confider\nevery thing as impoflible, that does not immediately fall within the com-\npafs of their own ideas; forgetting that the operations of Nature are as un-\nfearchable as they are curious, and that the ways of God furpafs all human\ncomprehenfion !\u2014and fo warped are they from every fentiment of libera\u00ad\nlity, that thofe who difeover a willingnefs to receive inftrudtion, or who\ndiffer from them in opinion, are condemned to ridicule and fcorn. But to\nfliew how reprehenfible fuch condudlis, we need only refledt on the unbe\u00ad\nlieving St. Thomas, and the pointed exclamation of our Saviour, upon that\noccafion. Men of this untoward difpofition, will take up my book from\nthe impulfc of curiofity, \u2019till recolledting themfelves, they will tofs it\nwith contempt into fome obfeure corner, and upbraid its author perhaps in\nterms not the moll liberal or pleafing. And yet, I am bold to fay, that\neven fuch perfons, invulnerable as they may be to the force of reafon,\nmight foon be convinced of the purity and excellence of this Science,\nwould they but fora time diveft themlelves of prejudice, and impartially\nweigh the evidence brought in its fupport.\u2014Nay, I have reafon to be\u00ad\nlieve, that how much foever they appear externally to condemn Aftrology,\nthey neverthelefs feel in their own mind, arid vainly attempt to ftifle,\nan internal convidtion of its abfolute exiftence. Would they but wifely\ncultivate this internal evidence, and put on the folid reafoning of dif-\npaffionate men, the order of nature would then unfold itfelf to their view,\nand the ltupendous works of Creation captivate their fenfes j \u2019till emu\u00ad\nlous of attaining the moll exalted knowledge, they would feck the vaft\nextent of fpace, and find the Whole canopy of heaven expanded for their\ncontemplation. And thus familiarized in the wonderful properties of\nheavenly and earthly things, they would no longer confider Aftrology\nas the parent of wicked compadt and infatuation, or the child of impof-\nture, but would be fenfible it contains the balfamic nutriment of Truth\nand Wifdom.\nThofe who deny the being of Aftrology, have furely never contem\u00ad\nplated the myfteries of their own exiftence, nor the common occurrences\nthat are infeparable from it j many of which are inexplicable when abftradt-\ncdly confidered, and only ceafe to ftrike us with wonder, bccaufe they are\nobvious\nDigitized by Google Original from\nMDl\/l\/ v n Q V Dl ID I i r I ID D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y\nobvious and familiar to our fenfes. If we recoiled: that the moA trivial\nincident in nature, cannot come to pafs without a caufe; and that thefe\ncaufes are inceffantly giving birth to a new fate, which at one time brings\nus comfort, and at another overwhelms us with misfortunes; that to-day\ngive6 us the full enjoyment of our wilhes, and to-morrow confounds\nevery imagination of our hearts j it is ftrange we (hould deny that fuch\ncaufes exift, when every hour\u2019s experience confirms the fad, by the good\nor ill fuccefs that conftantly attends all human purfuits. To illuftrate\nthis obfervation more fully, let us attentively confider the ftupendous\nframe or model of Nature, as laid down in the holy Scriptures, and en\u00ad\ndeavour to deduce therefrom the fubordinate dependence of one part upon\nanother, from the interior heavens, to the minuted: fubftance upon earth.\nHence we may poffibly difcover the origin of thefe caufes, and prove that\nAftrology does not exift in imagination only.\nThe fubftance of this great and glorious Frame, which the Almighty\ncreated, we call the world; and the world confifts of the heaven and the\nearth*. The model of it is, as the prophet Ezekiel defcribes it, in the\nform of a wheel-f; with many wheels within the fame, involved one\nwithin another. And thus we find it by mathematical demonftration ;\nfor the earth is a wheel or globe of fea and land, circumfcribed by the at-\nmofphere, as within a greater wheel, which is globous too; and furrounded\nby the heavens, as by many wheels involved one within another, encircling\nthe fun, moon, and ftars, and all the hoft of them. The power which\nfirft actuated and put thefe wheels in perpetual motion, was the fame\nwhich called them into exiftence; the executioners of whofe will, are re\u00ad\npresented by the Prophet under the fimilitude of four living creatures,\nimmeafurably endued with wifdom, courage, agility, and ftrength. And\nhence were life, and fpirit, find power, and virtue communicated to the\nheavens, and from the heavens to the earth, and from the earth to man\nand beaft, and to every plant and-herb, and earthly fubftance. Hence\nalfo are derived the magnetic powers, and wonderful properties of na\u00ad\nture j the virtues of fympathy and antipathy, the invifible effeCts of at\u00ad\ntraction and expulfion, and all the various influences of the ftars and\nThe proper agents of this noble ftruCture, are angels, and m e n t h e\none compofed of a pure etherial fpirit, and incorruptible; the other, in\nhis primary ftate, lefs pure, but incorruptible alfo, until his fall, which\nbrought upon himfelf and offspring mortality and death. The angels are\neithergoodorbad,andultimatelyknow their reward or doom j but the works\nplanets.\n* See Gen. i. i, f Ezck. i. 15. 16,\nOriginal from\nv n p t ' Dl IDI Ir I IDQADV\n\fi6 A N - I L L U S T R A T I O N\nof fallen man are yet upon the anvil, and time with us is (fill going >on.\nBut man is now endued, as in his primary (late, with the agency of a\nFree W ill, and hath good and evil, fora ted of his obedience, continually\nfet before him, with freedom to choofe either. And thus, unconftrained\neither by the immediate hand of God, or by the operation of the planets,\nas fecond caufes, fome embrace life, and others feek condemnation; and\nhence follow virtue and vice, profperity and adverlity, ficknefs and health,\nlife and death, and all the viciffitudes of Fortune. And though the rife\nand fall of empires proceed from the virtues and vices of thofe men who\ngovern and inhabit them ; and thefe virtues and vices proceed from the\nfree will or agency of thofe men ; and though the incidents .good and\nbad of one man\u2019s life are innumerable, and the men who are the fubjedts\nof thofe incidents in one fingle age, are innumerable alfo ; and though\nthe ages of men, (ince the creation of the world, are innumerable too j\nyet have all thefe multiplied incidents, whether trivial or important, come\nto pafs by a regular courfe or concatenation of caufes, originally im\u00ad\nplanted in the wheels or frame of nature. And with fuch minute per-\nfedtion was this ftupendous frame conllrudted, that neither the fall of\nman, nor the tremendous (hock which agitated the world upon that af*\nflidting occalion j not all the wickednefs of mankind in after ages, nor the\ndefolations which have rent the earth in confequence thereof, have yet\nimpaired the wheels of this aftonifhing machine, or for a moment im\u00ad\npeded its conflant and unceafing motion. And fuch was the amazing\nforefight and providence of God, that perceiving, .at one view, all the\nevents of futurity, the turnings and windings of every man\u2019s will, and the\ntotal fum and uplhot of all virtue and vice, he at once contrived the fates\nof profperity and adverlity, of rewards and punilhments fo to come up,\nas precifely to anfwer the virtues and prayers of the righteous, and the\nvices and profanenefs of the wicked, in all ages of the world, at their\nfit and appointed feafons.\nNow all mankind have each of them, more or lefs, a certain (hare of\nwifdom, power, or wealth, wherewith they occupy in this life, and carry\nforward all their undertakings. Thus we fee fome men, by means of\nriches, courage or contrivance, grow mighty, and purpofe, as if nothing\ncould impede the full accomplishment of their defigns and yet we find\nthere are two things which confound the wifeft, the greateft, and proudeft\nof them all, in the very fummit of their glory $\u2014 thefe are.

There is a certain lucky time in\nman\u2019s life, wherein if he go out to battle, though with but few men, yet\nhe carrieth the vidtory; and there is another time wherein, though he go\nout with ever fo complete an army, yet fhall he gain nothing but difgrace-f-.\nSoalfo there is a time when overtures of marriage fliall be fuccefsful, but a\nman\u2019s defires anfwer it not, and again there is a time when defires of mar\u00ad\nriage fhall ftrongly urge, and all overtures prove ineffectualbut there is\na time alfo when defircs and overtures fhall exadtly correfpond, and fuit\ntogether. In like manner, there is a time when profperity and riches fhall\noffer fhemfelves, and be attained, whether a man fleep or wake ; and by\nand by, though he purfue them with wings, yet fo unlucky a time occurs,\nas renders all his endeavours fruitlefs. Some men come into the world\nin a lucky hour, fo that let them be wife orfoolifh, they fliall be buoyed\nup on the wings of fate in all matters of wealth or honour, and fucceed in\nall that they take to ; while wifer and better men, fmitten with an un\u00ad\nlucky time of birth, fhall be as undefervedly difparaged, and all their un\u00ad\ndertakings fhall prove unfuccefsful and unhappy. Some fliall be lucky\nin the van of their enterprizes, and as unfortunate in the rear ; and others\nagain contrariwife. And thus time feems to mock and fport with the\nmen of this life, and to advance, or counteract, all their fkill and contri\u00ad\nvances, even to a degree infinitely beyond whatever we could reafonably\nconceive or expedt. And yet time of itfelf is but a dead thing, and a\nmere inftrument; but the wheels of the heavens turning upon it, imprint\nriddles in its face, and carve and cut out the .various fliapes of profperity\nandadverfity, upon the minuteft portion thereof. And wonderful it is to\nobferve, that a child, the moment it draws breath, becomes time-fmitten\nby the face of heaven, and receives an impreffion from the ftars therein,\nwhich taking rife from the afeendent, fun, moon, and other principal\nfignificators, operate as the imprefTors Hand, and point out, as with\nthe finger of God, the caufes whence the fate and fortune of the new\u00ad\nborn infant proceed; and whether it come before, or at its full time, or\nin what part of the world foever it is born, it matters not; for as the na\u00ad\nture of the fignificators are that afeend upon the horizon at the birth,\nfuch fhall certainly be the fortune of the J native. This is a truth that\n* See Eccl. iii. r, 2, &c. f Chap. ix. i r.\nX This aflonifhing property of nature will be illuftrated more at large, in its proper place,\nand the reader enabled, by plain and obvious rules, to make the experiment upon himielf, upon\nhis own family, or upon any other fubjedls he may think proper.\u2014The event of his own obfer-\nvations will confirm the fa\u00a3t> and afford him an inexhauftible fund of moral and religious con\u00ad\ntemplation !\nC will\nOriginal from\nM P A l v n c k ' Dl IPI Ir I ID\nDigitized by Gcx sle\n\fi8 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nwill bear the moft minute enquiry, and will be found the ordination of\nan all-wife and indulgent Providence, for the fpeculation and improvement\nof his creature man. And thefe fignificators reprefent, as it were, aferies\nof curious knots, which untie by courfe; and as every knot unties, dif\u00ad\nferent times feem to fly out, and perform their errands; and of thefe,\nfometimes we may obferve two, or three, or more, lucky knots opening\ntogether, and at other times as many that are inaufpicious. Yet all times\nare beautiful in theirfeafons, if men could hit them ; but through the ma\u00ad\nlignity of fin, and an intemperate purfuit of worldly pleafures, we often\nlofe the favourable time afforded us, of embracing the moll fubltantial\nhappinefs.\nJ y The fecond great lord over human inventions, is Chance. And thefe\njyfchances proceed from a great variety of rare and fecret operations of hea-\n, 'Vpn, which throw in the way of men thofe ftrange and fortuitous turns of\nfortune, that furpafs all human forefight or conception. And yet there\nis really no fuch thing as chance in nature ; much lefs can there be any\nthing that comes by chance, in refpedtof God ; but all thofe curious hits\nthat ftrike in between the caufe and its effedt, we call Chances, as belt fuit-\ning human ideas, becaufe of the undefcribable properties of them. For\nin fhuffling a pack of cards, or in calling the dice, it feems to us a meer\nchance what call lliall happen uppermoft, or what card will go to the\nbottom of the pack, and yet it is evident by experience, that there is a\ncertain luck in nature, which prelides over all thefe adventures, fo that a\nman lliall either win or lofe in a methodical courfe. It alfo happens in the\ntime of battle, and in every purfuit after wealth and honor, that chances\nfall in upon us, and turn the fcales by a fecret kind of fate, beyond all\nthat could reafonably have been expedted ; and thus heaven breathes into\nall human adtions, an infinity of thefe chances, that overturn the wifdom\nand power, and all the greatnefs of man. Thefe chances are uniformly\nmanaged by a certain kind of luck, either good or bad, which drives the\nnail; and this, by fome heavenly influence, that infufes a fecret virtue or\npoifon into our adtions, as courage into their hearts on one fide, or difmay\non the other ; and Ikill into fome mens heads to purfue the right courfe\nto be rich, or folly into others, whereby they run headlong to milery and\nwant; or elle fortunateth or infortunateth by miftake of words, fignals,\nor adts, that turn to the belt or worlt advantage, by llrange hits or mif-\ncarriages ; and thus it happens that a flight miftake in battle begets an utter\nrout,after a vidtory made almoft complete, by the meer utterance of a wrong\nword, or fleering an improper courfe. Eut which way foever it happens,\nthe whole matter is wrought by a good or ill luck, and the hand of God\nis at the bottom of i t ; not by any new contrived adt, but by the fame\n, regular courfe of nature, ordained from the beginning of the world.\nThus\nGoosle Original from\nMC\\AJ V f l D k ' DI IP I Ir I I B B A B V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 19\nThus both Time and Chance are the fervants of nature, under whofc\n\u25a0commands they fway the world, and worldly m en; but by her laws are\nboth of them difpofed. Time meafures out the extent of mens lives, and\nfets bounds how long they may live by ftrength of nature, and how much\nof that time fliall be extenuated by means of fin ; and it alfo carves out\nlimits to the particular fates of all mankind; and Chance aits in obferv-\nance of thofe limits, and brings about the good and bad fuccefs of every\nfate. And thus by the fervice of Time and Chance, nature performs all\nher great and.fecret operations, whether upon colledtive bodies, or places,\n\u2022or perfons. It may be thought firange that nature fhould bring forth men\n\u2022and women at a great diftance of years, hours, and places, all deftined to\n\u2022die at one time, and by the fame manner of death, either by war, plague,\npeftilence,' or Ihipwreck; and that time and chance fhould pick them up,\nand draw them together, from a variety of different purfuits, to partake\nat lafl: in one and the fame deftrudtive fate. Yet this is no more ftrange\nthan true; for thefe things frequently happen, and that by the imper\u00ad\nceptible influences of thofe heavenly afpedts and ftars, which their\ncourfes fought againji Sifera*. And by the fame rule, as many men, wo\u00ad\nmen, and children, are, on the other hand, gathered together by a fimi-\nlar force and virtue, to enjoy great and good fortune.\nSome perhaps will contend, that thefe operations of nature are incom\u00ad\npatible with the free agency of man\u2019s will. But if what has already\nbeen prcmifed be attentively confidered, this fuppofition will immedi\u00ad\nately vanifh; for God, who ordained the courle of nature, certainly\nforefaw the minuted turn of every man\u2019s will, and eventually contrived\nhis fate to correfpond therewith, fo as to admit its free and uncontrouled\nchoice. And whoever denies this antecedent principle, or prefcience of\n<2od in the conftrudtion of the world, denies one of his moft eflcntial\nattributes. The Will of man, without doubt, in a variety of inftances,\nmakes great druggies and wredlings with the ftarry influences, both\nin good and in evil purfuits, and often prevails over them exceedingly;\u2014\nfor though a perfon be born under fuch benevolent or malignant afpedts,\nas fliall point out his natural temper and difpofition, and indicate the\nprincipal tranfadtions, fortunate or unfortunate, that arc likely to be the\ndiftinguifliing marks of his life; yet does it depend entirely upon the\nfree uncontrouled will of that man, whether all thofe circumflances, fo\npointed out in his nativity, (hall come to pafs, or n o t; becaufe the free\nwill in every man, when fortified by habits of virtue and wifdom, often\n\u25a0enable him to over-rule thofe evil afpedts, fo as to avoid the commif-\niion of any criminal offence, and to guard him againd the misfortunes or\n* Judg, v. 20.\n\u2022loflfes\nGoosle Original from\nM\nPU\nfvnet' D\nl IDIIr IIDBADV\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nIoffes impending over him ; while men of a profligate and cardlefs\nhabit, not only lofe the advantages of a promifing nativity, but, if\nborn under malevolent afpedts, are often reduced to the laft ftage of di-\nftrefs, artd perifh under the very fame ftrokes of nature, which wifer\nand better men, born in the fame inaufpicious moments, have endured\nwith much eafe. And thus far fapiens dominabitur ajlris, the wife man,\nabove the fool, may ruledijg ftars. But we muff not forget, that under\nthefe operations of fate, there are many influences fo powerful, that no\nwifdom of man can oppofe. Such are the fatal wounds of death, w hen.\nnature\u2019s glafs is run out, and fuch the violent blows of excruciating\npain and ficknefs, and the high tides of profperity and adverfity; in all\nwhich cafes, we find by experience, ajira regunt , the ftars rule,\nand overpower men. Yet neverthelefs, fuch is the infinite prefcience\nand providence of God, that forefeeing the defires and deferts of all wife\nand holy men, in their different ages and times, he alfo laid their fates\nfuiting to their adtions. He forefaw Jofeph\u2019s prayers and tears in his\ncaptivity, and accordingly provided his advance in nature to correfpond\ntherewith*. He forefaw Hannah\u2019s falling, and earned:prayer, and ordained\nher opening womb to bud forth in courfe of nature exadtly anfwering\nthereto-f'. So that the wifdom and will of man has its full free work, with\u00ad\nout reftraint or controul; and grace and virtue adt by their own princi\u00ad\nples, as they are led by the Holy Ghoft; and yet nature, as it was contrived\nfrom all eternity, adls freely too. This is the dodtrine we are taught by\nthe word of God, which is confirmed by the evidence of our own reafon\nand experience.\nNow the fcience which we call Aftrology, is nothing more 'than the\nftudy or inveftigation of this frame or model of nature, with all its admi\u00ad\nrable produdtions and effedts j whereby we acquire a knowledge of the fe-\ncret virtues of the heavens, and the Ihining luminaries therein contained.\nIt is a fcience which all may attain to, by common diligence and applica\u00ad\ntion ; and the more we delight in it, the more readily do we forefee the\nmotions of future events, and the curiofities of chance and natural acci\u00ad\ndents, and the courfes of luck by which both are governed, and the order\nof fate, unto which all of them are fubfervient; together with all the\nmoft curious adts of attradling and expelling, alluring and threatening,\nencouraging and disheartening, and all fuch like operations of nature,\nmoft fecretly and imperceptibly performed, beyond the reach of ima\u00ad\ngination. And as by a fkill in this ftudy we attain to fee and experience\nthings that are paft, fo by the fame fkill we attain to a knowledge of\nthings which are to come and, by knowing the time of our birth, are\n* See Gen. xxxvir. and xli. 40.

Majorfum quam cuipojptfortuna tiocere.\nBut many men will not believe, that by natural means all or any of\nthis foreknowledge can be fairly and lawfully obtained; or that the in\u00ad\nfluences attributed to the heavenly bodies have any foundation in truth.\nIt is therefore neceflary, before I enter upon the practical part of the\nfcience, to bring fuch evidence in fupport of what has been already ad\u00ad\nvanced, as will be found incontrovertible and decifive ; and for this pur-\npofe I muft refer to the teftimony of thofe facred writings, which con\u00ad\ntain the revelation of God, and in which the dodtrine of this fcience is\nfo demonftrably proved, that it will be difficult to believe the one, with\u00ad\nout admitting the other. Let us confider the account given by Mofes, of\nthe creation of the heavenly bodies. God faid, \u201c Let there be lights in\nthe firnament of heaven, to divide the day from the night; the greater\nlight to rule the day, and the lefler light to rule the night, and let them\nbe for figns, and for feafons, and for days and years.\u201d\u2014Thefe then were\nthe purpofes for which they were ordained, and irrevocably fixed by their\ngreat Creator\u2014firft for lights; for had they not a place in the firmament,\nor were we deprived of their illuminating rays, we fhould be inftantly\noverwhelmed with impenetrable darknefs. Secondly, they are to divide the\nday from the night; and this they never ceafe to do ; for when the fun,\nthe greater light, is funk five degrees below our horizon, we call it night;\nfor then the moon andftars appear, andfhed their lefler light, and darknefs\nin fome degree is fpread around, and every thing declares it to be theftate\nof night. But when the fun, that glorious fountain of life, light, and\nmotion, begins to touch the eaflern verge of the horizon, darknefs is\ndifpelled, light begins again to dawn, and the ftars which beautifully be-\nfpangle our hemifphere, are foon obfcured by the full blaze of day ; but\nas days and nights are unequal, and never continue in one flay, thefe celef-\ntial luminaries diftinguilh their refpedtive reigns.

There\u00ad\nfore when God faith, Letthem be fo r fg n s, he mud fpeak in ref\nto man whom he formed a rational creature, capable of diflinguilhing one\nfign from another, and of improving by them. Nor are we to look upon\nthem as mere figns, like beacons upon a hill, or as only fetting bounds to\ndays, months, and years ; but we are to confider them as figns and tokens\nof thofe hidden events of futurity, which it concerns every wife and good\nman to know ; and which he may always forefee, by a virtuous and fober\nftudy of thefe intelligent figns, placed by God for that purpofe in the fir\u00ad\nmament of heaven. And that this was the intent of them, is clearly de-\nmonftrated by the words of our Saviour, when he foretold the deftru&ion\nof Jerufalem, and the final confummation of all things. His apoftles\nafked him. What (hall the fign of thefe things be? He replies. Earth\u00ad\nquakes, famines, and peftilences ; fearful fights in the heavens, and figns in\nthe fun, in the moon and in the * ftars. Such alfo was the fign by which\nthe Eaftern Sages difeovered the birth of our Saviour, and the place of\nhis nativity ; and numerous other infiances may be adduced, both from\nfacred and profane hiftory, in l'upport of this dodtrine.\u2014\u2014\n\u2014\n'The fourth ufe\nof thefe ceieftial luminaries, is for feafons. This is alfo obvious ; for we\nfind that heat and cold, and drought and moifture, are all guided and go\u00ad\nverned by the heavenly bodies; and that not only fpring and autumn,\nand fummer and winter, bear tefiimony of i t ; but we have it confirmed by\nthe evidence of our own conftitution and feeling; for when the weather\nis heavy and lowering, we find ourfelves dull and languid ; when bright\nand radiant, we are chearful and merry; and, when unfettled and uniea-\nfonable, we feel it by indifpofition and melancholy; and this is all brought\nabout by the operation of thefe luminaries upon the feafons of the year,\nin the due courfe of nature. The next ufe allotted them is fifthly for\ndays, and fixthly for years ; and that thefe are meafured out, and governed\nby them, is every way apparent; by the fun\u2019s circuit, and the moon\u2019s\nenergy.\u2014The fun, like a ftrong man, rejoices to run his race; he rifeth\nout of the chambers of the eaft, and with golden rays difpels the morn\u00ad\ning clouds, and exhales the pearly dew; chearing and refrefhing all na\u00ad\nture with his prefence. Hence it is evident that thefe luminaries were\nnot only placed in the heavens to give light upon the earth, to govern,\nthe feafons, and to fet bounds to tim e; but alfo to communicate figns\nand tokens to mankind, of things to come. We fhall now confider how\nfar it is fcriptural, and confonant to reafon, to allow them thofe influ\u00ad\nences attributed to them by Aftrology.\n* Lukexxi. 6, 7, 11, 15, &c.\nThat\nOrigirval from\nmcu\/ v n o r di iri 1r i irb a d v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y 23*\nThat the fun, moon, and all the planets, have a diredt and obvious influ\u00ad\nence upon earthly fubftances, no man of common obfervation will pretend\nto deny. The fun is the fountain of heat, and that heat is the nurfe of\nlife; and the moon is the fountain of moifture, which tempers the vio\u00ad\nlent heat of the fun, and modifies all his operations. But the fun and\nmoon, and all the planets, have each of them a particular fpecific pro\u00ad\nperty, according to their own innate quality, and according to the nature\nof that fign or band of ftars under which they happen to be pofited.\nThis is a fadt eftabliflied by repeated obfervation and experience; for\nwhen the fun enters the equinodtial fign Aries, the fpring begins to {hew\nherfelf, and ajl vegetative nature, by the moon\u2019s humidity and the fun\u2019s\ntemperate heat, feems to revive and flouriih, and, as it were, to rife from\nthe dead ; whither the cold blafts of the hyemnal air, had before configned\nit.- So, when his radiant beams enter the fign Taurus, they ftir up the\nbenign influences of the Pleiades and Hyades; Hcedi being then to the\nnorth, and Orion to the fouth, and Ardurus finking below the horizon ;\nand their cold and tempeftuous effedts begin to ceafe, as they are fuc-\nceeded by thefe benevolent conftellations which produce warm fouthern\nwinds, and gentle (howers, replenishing the earth, and caufing vegetation.\nAgain, when the fun rifes with the Dog-ftar, we find an influence which\neaul\u2019\nt's vehemency of heat, contagion, and infirmity. Medicaments ad-\nminiftered under this conftellation, prove hard and obnoxious; and we\nfind dogs at this time are apt to run mad; the fea is troubled without any\napparent caufe, and all nature feems more or lefs opprefled by i t ; and\nyet thefe effedts are never found to be equally violent in any two fummers,\nwhich clearly proves an influence in the ftars, as well as in the fun. And\nkeeps the fame conftant and invariable courfe\nagain, though the fun\nthrough the twelve figns of the Zodiac, for an infinity of annual revo\u00ad\nlutions, yet we never find the feafons and weather exadtly correfpond,\nwhich they doubtlefs would do, were it not that cold and heat, and wind\nand rain, are governed by the configurations the fun has with the planets\nand fixed ftars ; and this alio evidently proves the force of their influence.\nIt is likewife manifeft, that, whenever the planet Saturn is palling out of\none fign into another, the weather, is more or lefa turbulent.and.unfettled.\nBut it is not the weather only, nor the inanimate part of the creation\nalone, that is affedted by the influences of the fun, moon, and planets;\nfor we find they operate upon the human fpecies, and upon all animate\nnature, in every part of the world. The fun, and the quality of the\nheavens about the torrid zone, naturally occafion thofe men who are born\nand live under it to be quite black, with fhort crifped hair, of a mean\nftature, and hot conftitution, imbibing a fierce and favage fpirit; and\nthis\nOriginal from\nM P A \/ V f > D l \/ n i IDI i r I I D D\nigitized by Goi gle\n\fs\nif\ni\nn\nn\nfi\n-n\nH\n-w\n-\na\nQ\nn\nq\nq\na\n-\n'\nn\np\n\/\nf\ni\ni\nm\nc\nn\nn\nn\nh\np\ni\nr\naaaaaa\n\/\n\/\nt\nI\nt\nim\n\/\nn\n^\n7\nn\ni\nf\ni\ni\nn\n-\na\ni\nP\ni\nn\nn\no\n'\ni\ni\ni\np\nm\nn\nn\n24 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthis by reafon of the fun\u2019s .continual ftay and power in that fiery reglo\nIt is obfervable, that the inhabitants of the fouth, are of a better an\nquicker wit, and much more ingenious and tradable ; and this is acK\ncounted for by their vertical point being fituated nearer the zodiac,\nwhich the planet moves. So likewife the inhabitants of the north are of\"*\na ftrong body, but of rude manners and condition, bccaufe their vertical\npoint is placed at a great difiance from the fun\u2019s courfe; and therefore they\nabound with cold and moifture, and are of a phlegmatic conftitution, of\na fair complexion, tall, courageous, and ingenuous. Europe, being\niituated in the north-weft part of the earth, is under Mars in Aries; and,\nby reafon of this planet ruling in that triplicity, its inhabitants are na\u00ad\nturally of a noble and magnanimous fpirit, given to martial exploits, and\nfeats of war; of a generous mind, and courteous manners. And thus the\nfup, modified by the different figns and conftellations through which he\npaffes, regulates the climates, and ftieds his influence upon all mankind,\nleaving behind him evident marks of his government and fway. Some,\nindeed, have attempted to account for the fwarthy and black complexion\nof the favage race, by a variety of other plaufible conjedtures ; but none\nare to be relied on, that do not attribqte its caufe to the intenfe heat and\npower of the fun in thofe climates ; than which nothing can be more\nconfonant to reafon, fince we find, even in this country, that if we remain\nlong together in the fun, in the heat'of fummer, our complexions change,\nand we become in a degree tanned and fwarthy.\nConfpicuous as are the influences of the fun, thofe of the moon are no\nlefs fo. This is evinced by a confideration of that wonderful and never-\nceafing operation of the moon upon the ocean, fo as to occafion that per\u00ad\npetual flux and reflux of the fea, which we call tides. Here we fee the\nwaters of the vaft ocean, forgetful, as it were, of their natural reft, move\nand roll in tides obfequious to the ftrong attra&ive power of the moon,\nand with an increafe or diminution of force, in proportion as {he appears\nin ftrength, or want of afpecl. This is an influence fo univerfally ad\u00ad\nmitted, and fo peculiar to that luminary, that it eftablifties at once the\ndodtrine we contend for. But there are numerous other inftances of\nthe effefls of the moon, no lefs common than extraordinary, and perfectly\nwell known. Thofe unhappy perfons who labour under a deprivation of\nfenfe, and are afflidted with lunacy, have their fits more violent and ter\u00bb\nrible, in proportion as the moon increafesor diminifhes in light and mo\u00ad\ntion ; and, in all chronic and acute difeafes, her power and influence are\nvifibly and forcibly felt. Indeed every fubjedt of the creation is more or\nlefs effedted by the moon\u2019s energy ; the eyes of cats are obferved to fwell\nor fall at the full and change of the moon; and even the ftiell-fiih at the\nbottom\nOriginal from\nM C I A \/ \\ f m I DI I f * I I D D A D V\nDigitized by G O O C f l e\n\fI O F A S T R O L O G Y . 2 S\n2\n1. ie ocean, are known to feel the weight of her influence.\nfcwho deep in the fields, or in any place expofed to the open air, by\nflight, find their beads oppreflfed with water, and their fenfes inert\ny i heavy ; and butcher\u2019s meat hung up, and expofed to the moon-light,\n1\n1 foon putrify. The gardener alfo brings us abundant teftimonies of\ne influence of the moon upon the vegetable world. If peas are fown \/\nthe increafe of the moon, they never ceafe blooming; and, if\nid herbs are fet in the wane, experience Ihews they are neither fo rich in\navour, nor fo flrong and healthy, as when planted during her increafe; fo\nines, becaufe they Ihould not fpread too fall:, are ufually pruned in the\nvane. It is alfo remarkable that a pomegranate will, live only as many\nyears as the moon was days old when it was planted ; and, in planting\nfftrubs, or the like, if they are to Ihoot up ftrait and tall, and to take little\nroot, they are fet when the moon is in an airy fign and increafing in light;\nbut contrariwife when they are to take deep root, and to ftrike downwards.\nAnd thus we may obferve flowers that are under the moon\u2019s influence\nonly open their bloflfoms in the-night; whilft thofe which are peculiarly\nunder the government of the fun open every morning when he begins to\nrife, and clofe in the evening when he finks below the horizon. Thefe\neffeds and influences of the moon are fo common, and fo generally known,\nthat it were almoft needlefs to repeat them here, but for the purpofe of\ndrawing this conclufion, that, as one planet has a known and forcible ac\u00ad\ntion upon lublunary things, it is natural to believe that all the others\nare endued in fotne degree with a fimilar force and virtue. Indeed moll\nphyficians know that the planet Saturn rules all climaderical years, as the\nlun doth critical days, and the moon the crilis of all acute difeafes; and\nthat every fcventh year Saturn comes to the fquare or oppolition of his\nplace in the radix of every man\u2019s nativity ; and that, after the revolution\nof the fun, he becomes the chief ruler of critical days, and is often ob-\nferved, by his configurations with the moon, to fet afide the fatal crifis\nof thofe del'perate dilorders, over which the patient was not expeded to\nlive. From thefe phyfical reafons, we may fafely conclude that Saturn\nis by nature cold and melancholy, as the fun is hot and chearful ; and,\nbeing thus oppofite to the lun in quality andeffed, fo is he in relation to\nthe figns and manfions of the heavens where he bears rule, and therefore\ninclines always to cold, as the fun does to heat. Hence it follows, that\nwhen the fun is in Aquatics, which is the proper fign of Saturn, and op\u00ad\npofite to his own fign Leo, the weather inclines more to cold than to heat;\nand, at every conjunction, fquare, or oppolition, of Saturn with the two\ngreat luminaries, we always fin.i the weather cold, moift, and lowering,\neven in the mutft of the lummer, unlels the rays of Jupiter or Mars inter-\npofc, in which cafe thefe efteds are fomewhat lefs vifible.

Now the 1\nftars have no vifible operation upon us, befides that little light they ad- \"\nminifter to our eyes in a dark and clear night; and that is lb very fmall,\nthat all the ftars in heaven, befides the fun and moon, are not to be com\u00ad\npared, in this refpeCt, with the fmallefl. w ax-light; and this little light\ntoo is only to be had when the nights are ferene and unclouded. Can it\nthen be fuppofed that God made thefe glorious bodies, many of which\nare bigger than the whole earth, and move in their orbs as fo many other\nworlds in the heavens, merely for a twinkle in the night, and that only\nwhen the weather permits ? lo! every little daily that grows upon the cold\nground has a fecret and infenfible virtue wrapt in its leaves and flowers;\nand have thefe celeftial bodies no influences but what we now and then\ncatch with our eyes, as they occafionally fparkle their dim glances upon\nus ? Yes, they have each of them a fecret power and virtue, wherewith\nthey ad upon all earthly things, as well by day as by night, and in cloudy\nas well as in clear weather. But, as their operations are not performed by\nfenfible and palpable means, it follows that they have a fecret and hidden\nway of rule, whereby the influences are imperceptibly infufed into every\nconcern of this life. And, as have the ftars, fo alfo have the fun and\nmoon, a fecret and imperceptible aCtion, peculiar to themfelves ; for it is\nnot the mere heat that gives life, nor the mere moifture that fuftains i t ;\nfor, if that were the cafe, then might man make living creatures artificially.\nIt is true that heat may hatch the eggs, but all the ingenuity of man can\u00ad\nnot make an egg that can be hatched; for there is a fecret operation of\nthe fun and moon, independent of heat and moifture, necelfary to the pro-\ndudion of life, both in vegetive and fenfttive animals. And in thefe\nfecret and infenfible operations, befides the light that they give, confifts\nthat rule which the fun, moon, and ftars, were ordained to exercife over\nall the fons of day and night; and herein are written all thofe ordinances\nof the moon and ftars, which are to be a unto mankind, and to the\nwhole body of nature, fo long as the world -j*endures.

And to this enfed the Almighty difcourfes\nwith Job, concerning the treafures of theflow and hail, which he has hid\nagainfl thetime of trouble, and the day of war and \u00a7 battle. Now what can\nwe fuppofe the meaning of this hiding to be, but the order of thofe me\u00ad\nteors, fo curioufly lodged within tHe arms of the ftars, and withheld by\ntheir influences, that they may fall by due courfe of nature, at fuch exatt\nperiods, as to effedl the punilhment of the wicked, and of God\u2019s declared\nenemies, fuch as was Silera, at the precife time when their abominations\ncall forth the judgments of an injured and incenfed Deity ?

If without means, then every child that is\nborn, and every feed that grows out of the ground, mull of neceffity come\nto pafs by a new creation; for to bring things into exiftence without\nmeans, is the fame as to produce them without matter; and requires no\nmore; but for the Almighty to fay. Let there be men, or. Let there be\nleaves and flowers; and, as the Word fays, they come to pafs. But we\nare certain there never was more than one creation, which was at the be\u00ad\nginning of the world, and ever fince that time all things are come to\npafs by a regular courfe of nature; and hence it follows that there mult\nbe a natural and efficient means for the produdlion of all things. And,\nif fo, then mull thefe things come to pafs by an earthly means alone, or\nmeans alone, it is evident, they cannot come to pafs; for we know ex\u00ad\nperimentally, that neither fire, earth, air, or water, can of themfelves in-\nfufe into the rofe its grateful and fragrant fmell; it mull therefore pro\u00ad\nceed from the agency of fome fpiritual or material fubftance, far fuperior\nin efficacy and virtue to any earthly element. If it proceeds from a fpi\u00ad\nritual fubftance, it is effected either by the angels, or by the foul of the\nworld. But by the angels we know it cannot be; for they have their pe\u00ad\nculiar offices alloted them in another way; and, though they are fubjedfcs\nof the world, yet are they no part of the great frame of nature, from\nwhence all things in their order are formed. And, if it be effected by the\nfoul of the world, then certainly mull there be fuch a foul fomewhere ex-\nifting, which at prefent is a matter in difpute among the learned; and this\nfoul mull have a fpecial feat in the world, worthy of itfelf, from whence it\nmay inform and aduate every minute particle of the creation. If this be\nadmitted, then it undoubtedly dwells among the celeftial matter, and from .\nthence fupplies the earth, through the medium of the heavenly bodies,\nwith all that power and virtue, which brings to pafs that variety of lhape,\ncolour, fmell, life, and increafe, which we daily fee come to pafs.

But now both the earth and water are under the face of heaven,\nand the light is upon this heaven, and the fpirit of God moveth upon the\nface of the heavens in that light; and, as he a&uates the earth and the\nwaters by the h\ne\na\nv\ne\nn\ns\n, fo doth he aduate the heavens by himfelf. And\nagreeably to this idea fpeaks the prophet Hofea, when he fays, Godwill\nhear the heavens, and they Jhall hear the earth, and the earth the corn and\n\u2022wine and oil, and they JhaU hear *\nJezreel; wherein he thew\nman lives by corn and wine, fo they by the earth, and the earth by the hea\u00ad\nvens ; and, if fo, then by the heavens is it that the earth receives all its effi\u00ad\ncacy and virtue, whereby it brings forth fmell, colour, tafte, and life.\nMofes alfo tells us, that Godfoall open his good treafure the heavens, to give\nrain unto the land, and to blefs all -j- works of our hands; whence it is evi\u00ad\ndent that there lodges in the celeftial influences a faculty of fortunating\ncivil affairs, as well as of managing natural things ; and that the root of\nall earthly bleffings is from heaven. Mofes fays again, that fun, moon,\nandJlars, God hath dijlributed unto all nations under heaven; and the\nPfalrnift, fpeaking of the fun and heavenly bodies, fays, they declare the\nglory of God, and \/hew forth his handy-work', day and night do continually\ntell ofthem, and their voice is heard in all languages, and their words are\ngone into the ends of the \u00a7 w\no\nr\nl\nd; by which we learn that the\nand all the ftars therein, are full of fuch virtues as the whole world hath '\nneed of; and that thefe virtues God hath lodged in the heavens, to be\ndealt out for the comfort and happinefs of his creatures upon earth. His\nfpirit (faith Job) hath garnifhed the J heavens', and by the fpirit of his\nmouth was the whole army of heaven piade.\nThe notion, or idea, that there is one general foul actuating the whole\nworld, as there is one foul informing every man\u2019s body, was not only the\nopinion of the Platonifts and ancient philofophers, but alfo of many\nlearned men in later ages; and I muft confefs, it appears very reafonable to\nbelieve, that the world has fuch a foul. For were there not one and the\nfame general living virtue, comprehending the whole fyftem of nature,\n* Hofea it. 21, 22. f Deut. xxviii. 12. \u20ac Deut. iv, 19. Pfiil. xix. 3, 5.\nJ Job xxvi. 13.

Where life\nis, thefe things are eafily effected; as the child in the womb is nourifhed\nby the food the mother eats; but in the inanimate part of the creation,\nwe are at a lofs which way to account for it. Now, admitting that there\nreally is fuch an univerfal foul existing, yet is it questionable whether\nthis foul be intelle&ual, or merely vegetive. That there is an intelledtnal\npower informing the whole world, as the foul does the body, i9 not to be\ndoubted ; for otherwife the whole frame of nature would be inert and\nmotionlefs; but then, if we admit the foul of the world to carry this in\u00ad\ntellect in its own brain, it will follow, that this foul is a God; for an\nintelledual being, filling heaven and earth with its prefence, is an attri\u00ad\nbute of * Gods. Hence I conclude there is an univerfal foul in the\nworld, but that it is only vegetive, and not intellerftual; and that in this\nfoul dwells the fpirit of Almighty God, whofilleth the heavens and the\nearth with his prefence, and from hence garniSheth the heavens, and\ncaul'eth the precious influences of the fun, moon, and ftars, to be distri\u00ad\nbuted into all parts of the \u00a7 world. And thus God rules immediately in\nthe heavens, but rules the world mediately by the heavens. It is true,\nindeed, that God is equally well able to govern and maintain the world\nwithout means, as he was at firft to constitute and create the frame of na\u00ad\nture; but fuch is His divine will and pleafure, that he has thought fit to\nbring all things to pafs by virtue of means, as ordained from the beginning\n\u00a9f the world. It is a common and true maxim, that God and nature\nhave made nothing in vain; and yet it is as true, that grafs and herbs\ngrow where no creatures live to eat -f them. Now, were the world go\u00ad\nverned by God\u2019s immediate prefence only, then would the produdtion of\nthis grafs and herb be a work in vain ; becaufe God\u2019s word brings\nforth all things at pleafure; and, having a power of increasing or dimi\u00ad\nnishing its operation in a moment, would certainly not have brought forth\nthis fertility in an uninhabited and defolate country. But nature, running\nher courfe by a conftant and unchangeable decree, has no power to ceafe\nher work without a miracle, and therefore, though the grafs may grow in\nvain, yet nature\u2019s operations are not in vain, fince by one and the fame,\ncaufe it produces vegetation in all parts of the world.\n* See Jer. xxiii, 23* 24, 25. \u00a7 Aits xvii. 38.

And when this line (hall be en\u00ad\ntirely wound off, then will the frame o f nature find its -f~ period, and all\nfubordinate wheels will ceafe their motion. But until that time, there\nis allotted in this frame of nature, unto every one that comes into the\nworld, a certain order or courfe of life, by which he runs through fick-\nnefs and health, honour and difhonour, and all the occurrences of life,\nfrom his cradle to the grave. For man is, as it were, a little world within\nhimfelf; and, though he dand but as one wheel in the frame of the great\nworld, yet within this one there feems many thoufands of wheels, efpe-\ncially in enterprifing people, which appear to move one within another\nalmod ad infinitum, till the thread turned on the outer wheel break, or ,\nelfe be wound off, and there they make a dop, and die. All thefe things\nGod, who made man at the firft, perfectly knows, and foreknew from\nthe beginning of the world; and, by this order of man\u2019s life, he perfectly\nknows all the paffages of our lives, and even the mod fecret thoughts of\nour hearts, both deeping and J waking; and how one thought drives off\nand brings on another, and continues To doing till the lad moment of our\nlife, when our breath fails. Now evfcry man being, as it were, a wheel\nof the great world, it will follow that all men move in a certain frame or\nwheel above themfelves, by virtue of which the mader-wheel of every\nman\u2019s life is put in motion; and this wheel is fubordinate unto others,\nand thefe alfo unto the mader-wheel of the whole world, which is the\nhigh and mighty wheel of heaven, wherein the fun, moon, and dars are,\nfet, jo carry on the great works of nature, unto the end of time. And\nhence comes the original of every man\u2019s nativity, and of all natural qua\u00ad\nlities, paffions, and incidents of our lives, except the motions of our free*\nwill and reafon, which may be allured and inclined by the works of na\u00ad\nture, bpt cannot be forced by them. Now above and beyond this great\nwheel of nature, there is yet another \u00a7 wheel, within which the heavens\nthemfelves are turned;- and herein is that great and hidden line of time,\nwhereby the whole world, with alJLits dependencies, is made to hold on\nand continue its motion, unto the final end of all things ; and this ftu*\n* Afls xv. 18. f 2P\neter iii. %John ii. 24, 25. \u00a7 2Cor. xii. 2, 3, 4-\n' pendous\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM C I A \/ v n o t ' m ID I I n I I D D\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 43\npendous wheel is God himfelf, \"Who draws out the line of time,\nupon the circles of the earthy he jlretches out the heavens as a curtain, and\nbeholdeth all the inhabitants of the world as grafsboppers under his * fe e t;\nand hence he difcerns, as.it were, with one view, all the World naked\nbefore him, both paft, prefent, and to come.\nFrom what has been advanced, it appears obvious that every occurrence\nof our lives, and all the various produdtions of nature, however ftrange\nor incomprehenfible they may appear, are brought to pafs by a regular\nand efiablifhed means, decreed by the wifdom of God, at the begin\u00ad\nning of the world j and confequently, whatever happens by a contrary\neffefl, muft of necefiity be produced by the immediate hand of God, and\nconflitutes a miracle. Such was the cafe when the Almighty made the\nfun and moon fland ffcill; and when, at the prayer of Ifaiah, he reverfed\nits courfe, and made it retrograde. Such alfo were the works of our Savi\u00ad\nour, when he raifed the dead, and gave fight to men born blind. And fuch\nwas the work of God, when the fea made a lane for men to pafs through\non dry ground ; and when the fire had no power to fcorch nor tQ burn\nthofe who walked in the midfl: of *\nj~ it. Thefe miracles, it is true, had\nno immediate dependance upon the works of nature; and yet, as God\nfrom the beginning faw the necefiity of them, and the occafion upon\nwhich they would be required, it is reafonable tofuppofe he fet down in\nhis eternal mind the contrivance of thefe miracles, and fo ordained them\nto keep pace with the works of nature, and to come to pafs at their ap\u00ad\npointed feafons, without diflurbing or deranging that univerfal frame of\nthe world, out of which all natural things proceed, and from whence all\nthe hofl of heaven derive their faculty of influencing earthly fubftances.\nAnd that the heavenly bodies poflefs thefe influences, in an infinitely\npowerful degree, I believe will not be denied, fince both fcripture and\nreafon, as we have now feen, fubftantially prove them. The ancient\nphilofophers were unanimous in fubfcribing to this opinion, even with\u00ad\nout the teftimony of the facred writings; and many very learned authors,\nin later ages, have fupported the fame dodtrine.

And yet he has fhewn, by very fatisfac-\ntory obfervations, that \u201c the fixed ftars are fo many glorious funs, with\nfyftems and worlds furrounding them fimilar to our o w n a n d that\n\u201c the Almighty would not have placed them at fuch diftances from each\nother, unlefs proper objedts were near enough to be benefited by their\ninfluences.\u201d Hetace it follows, from his own hypothefis, that the fixed\nftars do each of them poflefs a natural -f* influence, homogeneal to the fun\nand moon. But to what diftance the fixed ftars, or any of the heavenly\nbodies, are capable of extending thefe influences, is beyond the power of\nthe moft enlightened mind to determine ;\nfince the celeft\nthrough aboundlefs and unlimited fpace, and operates upon every fub-\nftance that falls within the line of its direction. And now, having made\nit apparent, by an union of concurrent teftimonies, that the fun, moon,\nand ftars, have their refpedtive influences, and that an Aftrology in the\nheavens does by confequence exift, it will be proper to confider how far\nthe ftudy of this noble fcience is compatible with our moral and religu\nous obligations, and what degree of it is attainable\nftanding.\nThat the ftudy and practice of Aftrology is a moral purfuit becoming\nfober and religious men, may be collected from the cuftoms of the an\u00ad\ncients in all enlightened countries j as well as from the beft and wifeft of\nGod\u2019s chofen people. And that our all-wile and beneficent Creator\noriginally implanted in the frame of nature a means whereby mankind\nmay attain to the knowledge of fuch future contingencies as concern their\nwelfare and happinefs, is in no refpedt to be doubted, fince we obferve\nin the brute creation, that even the moft inconfiderable creatures upon\nthe earth are more or lefs endowed with a gift of foreknowledge.

Their\nholes are alfo conftruCted with amazing art, and have generally two a-\npertures, that, in cafe one is befet by an enemy, they may cfcape by the\nother. The doublings of the hare, and the tricks of the fox, to efcape\nthe hounds, are alfo aftonifhing indications of forefight and fagacity.\nThe feathered race are likewife endowed with a fimilar faculty, and often\nforetel an approaching florm a confidefable time before it appears; by re\u00ad\ntiring in flocks to their holes and hiding-places for fhelter and protection.\nThe birds of paflage feem to inherit this gift in a molt remarkable de\u00ad\ngree ; for they afl'emble together in prodigious flocks, at an appointed\nhour, and take their leave of us before the approach of winter, which\nthey forefee will deftroy the flies and other infeds upon which their own\nlife depends, as they feed upon nothing elfe. And it is no lefs extraor\u00ad\ndinary than true,, that thefe birds return as early as the fun brings forth\nthis ctafs of infetls into new life; and they have alfo the fagacity to find out\nand repofiefs their former nefts and * habitations.

And this purluit of one fpecies of fifh after another, is by\nno means confined to a Angle region; for we find fhoals of them purfu-\ning one another, from the vicinity of the pole even down to the equator;\nand thus the cod, from, the bank of Newfoundland, purfues the whiting,\nwhich flies before it, even to the fouthern fhores of Spain.

We\nhave already leen that Adam, previous to his expulfion from Paradife, was\ninftru&ed in a foreknowledge of futurity, by the exprefs command of\nGod, as a means of enlarginghis mind, and alleviating his diftrefs, upon\nbeing turned adrift into the wide world. Jofephus, an hiftorian of cha\u00ad\nracter and eminence, who quotes the moll ancient authors of refpeflability\nfor what he alTerts, confirms the fame thing, and further informs us, that\nAdam, before his death, inftrudted his fon Seth in this fcience, who after\u00ad\nwards engraved the rudiments of it upon permanent pillars of ftone, which\nendured through many generations, and were not entirely effaced till fome\ntime after the * deluge. We have it from the fame authority, that the\nart was taught by Enos and Noah, who preferved it to the days of Abra\u00ad\nham, and he increafed the knowledge of it by divine aids, teaching it to\nthe Chaldeans and Egyptians. Jofeph is alfo faid to have patronifed and\n\u00a7 I w ould recom m end a ferious and attentive perufal o f thefe fcriptures to every perfon w ho\nhas doubts concerning the do& rine of A ftrology. It is here pointed out, to the underftanding\no f the m oft unlettered part o f m ankind, that the great and terrible day of the L o rd , the day of\njudgm ent, will m oft anuredly com e.

Mofes afterwards\ntaught and profefled it, independent of the gift of prophecy, which al\u00ad\nways came by divine infpiration, and confequently was only exercifed\nupon certain extraordinary occafions. From Mofes, we are told, the pro\u00ad\nphets and feers had it; and that it was afterwards particularly taught\namong the tribe of Iflachar, who are on that account (tiled in the facred\nwritings, Men whohad underjlanding in, and were expert at re\u00ad\nviving all queftions concerning futurity; and as this tribe were neither\npriefts nor Levites, nor endued with the fpirit of prophecy, it follows\nthat their underjlanding in the times, and their ability in foretelling future\nevents, arofe entirely from an acquired knowledge of the figns and influ\u00ad\nences of the heavenly bodies. For the fame reafon the Perfian aftrologers\nwere called mages, or wife men, who were (killed in the times; and the\nChaldeans termed their young ftudents in aftrology, MenJkilled in ivifdom\nand cunning \u00a7fcience, to learn the learning ofthe Chaldeans. And, after the\nChaldean method of ftudying the fcience of aftrology, Daniel, and Shad-\nrach, and Mefech, and Abednego, were inftruCted by their tutor Melzar,\nand became ten times more learned in all matters and underjlanding\nthan all the ajlrologers in the r\ne\na\nl\nm\n, in confideration of which\nelected members of the public * fchools at Babylon, which were founded\nfor the ftudy of this a rt; and Daniel was made, by the, king\u2019s decree,\nmafter over the Chaldean || aftrologers.\nIn the days of Samuel, it appears to have been a common cuftom to go\nto the feers, or men of underftanding in the times, not only to be inform\u00ad\ned concerning future contingencies, but alfo to enquire after loft goods..\nTo this effect we find Saul and his fervants difeourfing, when they were\nfent out to find the ftrayed afles of Kiftt, Saul\u2019s father; and, not being able\nto find them, the fervant propofes to go and enquire of the leer, which way\nthe afles were gone, and where they may be found. Saul agrees to this, but\n(ks, What have we to give him ? we have no bread , nor have we any\nufjicient prefent. The fervant replies, I have afourth part of a\nfiv e r; I'll give him that. Saul anfwers. ; let ** us go. This\npaflages enables us to diftinguifh between the gift of prophecy, for the\npurpofes of eftablilhing God\u2019s true religion, and the art of anfwering ho\u00ad\nrary queftions, and predicting future events.

In\nthe fame way we find David, when in Keilah, where he heard that Saul\nwas coming to befiege him, was defirous of knowing the truth, whether\nSaul was coming or notj and if he was. Whether the men of Keilah would\nbe true to him, or would betray him. And being informed they would\nbetray him into the hands of the enemy, who were feeking his life, he\nfled into the wildernefs of Ziph, and efcaped the danger that was im\u00ad\npending over-j-him. And in the New Teftament alfo, we have fre\u00ad\nquent confirmations of the meteorological part of this fcience, from our\nSaviour\u2019s own words, in his converfation with the pharifees, who were\nall verfed in aftrology. He addrefles them to this effed : \u201c When it is\n** evening, ye fay, it will be fair weather, becaufe the fky is red ; and\n\" in the morning it will be foul weather, becaufe the fky is red and\n\u201c lowering.

Ye hy-\n** pocrites, ye can difcern the face of the || fky, but the figns of the times\n**ye cannot difcern.\u201d And now, if we impartially contemplate the\norigin and antiquity of this fcience, and recoiled: that the beft andwifeft\nmen in every age of the world were profeflbrs of it, we muft admit its\npractice to be highly confiftent with all our moral and religious duties.\nThat the human undetftanding is alfo capable of attaining to a very\nhigh degree of knowledge in the hidden works of futurity, and in the\nfecret operations of nature, is likewife to be proved, beyond the power\nof contradiction. Indeed the paffages already quoted from the holy\nfcriptures are a fufficient confirmation of it to every difpaffionate-reader;\nbut, as there are fome very extraordinary inftances of this predidtive fa\u00ad\nculty recorded by different hiftorians, I will juft mention a few of\nthem, by way of corrobating the evidence already brought in its fup-\nport. \u2019I he Emperor Domitian required the profeffor Largius Proculus\nto calculate his nativity, from the fuppofed time of his birth, which was\ndone, and delivered into the emperor\u2019s own hands. Afclatarius, a moft\nfamous aftrologer of thofe times, procuring a copy of this nativity, rec\u00ad\ntified it, and foretold the hour and manner of the emperor\u2019s death; which\nwhen Domitian heard, he commanded Afclatarius to be brought before\nhim, when he affirmed his predidions would prove true. Domitian aflc-\ned him if he could foretel the manner of his own death ? Afclatarius re\u00ad\nplied, That he knew he ftiould ffiortly be torn in pieces by dogs ; but, to\nconfute the aftrologer, the emperor ordered him to be burnt alive. The\ncruel fentence was accordingly put in execution; his body was bound and\nir 1Sam. xxiii. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. |fSee Matth, xvi. a Lukexii. 24, 55, 56.\nlaid\nDigitized by Go*,'file Original from\nm c u \/ v n c v Diim i r 1 i d d a d v\n\f5o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nlaid upon the pile, and the fire kindled; but at that inftant there arofea\ndreadful ftorm of wind and rain, which drove the fpeclators away, and\nextinguifhcd the fire; and Afclatarius was afterwards torn in pieces by\ndogs, as he had foretold. When Latinus informed the emperor of this\nevent, he was greatly mortified, and very'melancholy; and, on the day his\naflaflination had been predicted, he feigned himfelf indifpofed, and locked\nhinnfelf up in his chamber. Stephanus, the captain of his guards, went to\nhis door, pretending he had received fome important difpatches, which\nhe wanted to deliver to him; but, Domitian declining to admit him till a\ncertain hour was part, Stephanus perfuaded him it was then much later\nthan the time fpecified. The emperor, in confequence, concluding the\ndanger to have palled by with the hour, or looking upon the predidtion as a\nmere fable, feeing no confpiracy or danger about him, opened the door,\nupon which Stephanus fteppedupto him with a drawn dagger, and ftabbed\nhim to the heart, in the very hour that had been predicted by the aftro-\nloger, on the eighteenth day of September, the month he had ordered to\nbe called * Germanicus. The fame writers add, that Apollonius Tyaneus\nwas at that inftant of time at Ephefus, Handing in the prefence of the\nmagiftrates, and in a kind of ecftacy cried out, O Stephanus, ftrike the\ntyrant; and after a paufe added, \u2019Tis well, thou haft killed him. This art\nof re&ifying nativities, a difcovery which brought the fcience to very\nhigh perfedtion, and has enabled its profeflors to be aftonifhingly exadt in\npredictions of confequence. Thus Lucius Tarutius Firmianus, by the\naCts of Romulus\u2019s life, and the time of his death, found that he was born\nin the firft year of the fecond Olympiad, the twenty-third day of the\nmonth about lun-rifing. And hence he difcovered that the building of\nRomewas begun when the Moon was in Libra, theSun with Mercury, and\nVenus in Taurus, Jupiter in Pifces, and Saturn with Mars in -j- Scorpio.\nThe Archbifhop of Pifa confulted feveral different profelfors of aftrology\nconcerning his deftiny, and they all calculated his nativity at different\ntimes, and without any communication with one another; but they all\nforetold him he would be hanged. It feemed highly incredible at the\ntime, becaufe he wasinfomuch honourand power; but theevent juftified\nthe predictions; for in the fedition of Pope Sextius IV. in the fudden\nrage and uproar of the people he was ieized and J; hanged. Petrus\nLeontius, a celebrated phyfician and aftrologer of Spoletanum,cafthis own\nnativity, and foretold that his death would be occafioned by water, and\nmany years afterwards he was found drowned in a pond, into which he\nhad fallen the preceding night, by miftaking his \u00a7 way.

He would not with the bands of matrimony bind\nhimfelf from that better fortune which the liars had promifed him if\nhe continued to live Angle and unmarried. And he was afterwards really\nmade Pope*. Picus Mirandula was a fevere writer againft Aftrology,\ninfomuch that he was termed, Flagellum Aftrologorum ; and, to flop the\nmalignity of his pen, Lucius Bellantius, and two other aflrologers of\neminence, procured the time of his birth, and calculated his nativity,\nwhich they afterwards fent him, with this prediction inclofed, \u201c That he\nwould die in the thirty-third year of his age.\u201d This exafperated him fo\nmuch, that he began to write a new trail, with inconceivable afperity,\nagainft the poor aflrologers, attempting to prove their calculations a mere\nbubble, and themfelves a fet of impoftors. But, when the fatal ap\u00ad\npointed hour arrived, he faw the folly of his own conceits; recanted his\nopinion, and fealed by his death a Handing memorial of the inerrability\nand truth of this fcience. Many other extraordinary circumflances of\nthe kind might be related from different authors, were it not already\nfufliciently obvious that the intellectual faculties of man, when culti\u00ad\nvated by fludy, and improved by obfervation and experience, are capable\nof attaining a very extenfive degree of knowledge and fkill in this art.\nWe will therefore difmifs this argument, and endeavour to exolain what\nthe fubjeds are that the fcience of Aflrology naturally comprehends.\nAftrology is compounded of \u00abo^p\n, Jlar> and x\no\nr\u00ab\n5\n, and literally\nimplies,fhe doSlrineof the J\ni\na\nr\ns\n; teaching how to judge of their e\nand fecret influences, and to foretel future events, by the order of their\ndifferent afpeds, qualities, and pofitions j and alfo how to difeover their\nenergy and force upon earthly fubflances, in the wonderful and abflrufe\noperations of the nature. It comprehends the mofl excellent part of that\nnoble fcience called Phyfiology, or natural Philofophy, which is the doc\u00ad\ntrine of natural bodies in the conflrudion of the works of nature. The\nbody natural may be conceived either generally, as one perfed and entire\nbody; or fpecially, as it may be divided into two, or fubdivided into\nmany thoufand component parts. This grand and perfed body of na\u00ad\nture is called the World, or the whole world, which is generally confi-\ndered as making but one entire body ; but this general body admits of\nmany fpecial divifions and fubdivifions j and is firft divided into two\n* V id.

Specu\u00ad\nlative. Geology confifts in the fimple inveftigation of the earth, either\nin whole, or in part, and of the principles and aifedlions thereof.; and to\n\u2022this purpofe it treats either of the common being of any earthly thing,\nmerely as it is a being abftradt from all matter, whether intelligible, or\nfenfible ; and as it operates thus, it is termed Metaphyfical or Preter\u00ad\nnatural Philofophy. But, if it difcourfes of a movable being in matter,\nand that as it is perfe&ly material, it is then called Natural Philofophy.\nOr, if it fpeaks of things converfant in matter intelligible, but not fen\u00ad\nfible, as they are the abftradts of matter, it is named Mathematical or\nAbftratt Philofophy. Of this fort of fcience the fubjedt is Quantity,\nand is either continued, or difcrete. If,o f continued quantity, it is\ncalled Geometry, or its fubordinate, Perfpedtive ; but if the quantity be\ndifcrete, it is then termed Arithmetic,-or its fubordinate, Mufic. Na\u00ad\ntural Philofophy properly fo called, -treats of terreftrial bodies, either\nfimple or mixed. The fimple bodies confift of the four elements,\ncalled Fire, Air, Earth, and Water, which occupy all places, from the\nutmoft and inferior bodies .of -the heavenly matter unto the inmoft cen\u00ad\ntre of the earth; fo that-vacuum no where exifts under the cope of\nheaven. The mixed bodies are compounded of thefe four elements, and\nare divided into animate and inanimate bodies. And all animate bodies\nare endued either with a,vegetive, fenfitive, or rational, faculty. Now,\nwhile we ftudy the dodtrine of this earthly body natural, the fciences of\nGeography, Hiftory, and Chronology, naturally flow from i t : the firft\nof which defcribes the fituation and boundaries of the different parts of\nthe earth ; the fecond relates the hiftory of whatever has been feen or\ntranfadled upon it; and the third computes and adjuftsall the different\n,a;ras and portions of time, from the creation of the world to the pre-*\nfent hour. And fubordinate to thefe are Topography, or a defcription of\nparticular places, and Chronologies of certain diftindt periods of time.\nPradtical Geology is that part 'of natural Philofophy which confifts in\nSpeculation, for the profit and advantage of mankind ; and leaves a track\nor fruit of its operation remaining, when the adt itfelf is paft and gone.\nAnd this is a fort of ftudy clafled under the denomination of Art, rather\nthan of Science. The fubjedt of it muft be either Man himfelf, or fome\nfubordinate fubftance. If Man be the fubjedt of inveftigation, then the\nobjedt will be to teach him precepts of morality ; and this we call\nEthical\nOriginal from\nMClJhf V r ^ D IS n i I DI I r ' \u25a0 i n n a n w\nDigitized by Google\n\fO P A S T R O L O G Y . 53\nEthical Philofophy j orelfe to inftru&him in the Art of Reafoning, called\nLogical Philofophy ; or in the Art of Speaking, which we term Gram\u00ad\nmatical or Rhetorical Philofophy. But, if the Speculation be upon any\nfubordinate fubftance, then the Earth itfelf, or the productions of it,\nbecome the fubjcft of inveftigation. If it be the Earth, then the bufi-\nnefs we contemplate, is to improve and cultivate the foil, for the en-\ncreafe of ufeful vegetation, which is called Agriculture $ but, if it be the\nproductions of the earth, then the ftudy mutt be fo to prepare and manu\u00ad\nfacture them, as to render them the effentials of Health, Wealth, Food,\nor Cloathing; or whatever elfe is conductive to the comforts or neceffi-\nties of mankind. And thefe are feverally diftinguilhed by as many fig\u2014\nnificant Terms as there are occupations or employments, by the inven\u00ad\ntion and ufe of which all thefe things are produced.\nUranology is a Science which treats of the natural body of Heaven*\nafter the fame manner as Geology deferibes that of the Earth ; and fpeak8\neither generally, of the whole Heaven ; or fpecially, of fome particular\nor diftinCt part of it. And, as Uranology is a part of Phyfiology, fo has\nit the fame principles, whether internal, as Matter and Form ; or ex\u00ad\nternal, as thecaufes Efficient and Final; and thefe are Principles of their\nown nature, as Chance and Fortune are Principles by accident. It hath\nalfo affeClions internal, as Motion and Reft, and Finity and Infinity j\nand the fame external, as Time and Place. Uranology is alfo either\nfpeculative or pra&ical. Speculative Uranology confifts in the Ample\nknowledge of the Heavens, either in whole or in part, and of their\nvarious Principles and AffeCtions j and to this purpofe it fpeaks of thefe\nthings either mathematically or naturally. Mathematically, it treats\nof Aftronomy, or Uranometry, which is a fcience that points out the\nmagnitude, meafure, and motion, of the heavens, and of the ftars there\u00ad\nin ; and naturally, it defines the qualities, motions, afpeCts, and opera\u00ad\ntions, of the heavenly Bodies, and all their apparent and infenfible in\u00ad\nfluences. Praftical Uranology is that fublime Art, which, being once\nperfectly known and rightly underftood, enables a man, by his fkill in\nthe affeCtions of the Heavens and heavenly Bodies, to unbofom the re-\nmoteft tranfaCtions of futurity, and to trace the myftcrious and mod\nobfeure operations of Nature to their fource j whence he defines the in\u00ad\nnate principles and virtues of all animal, vegetable, and mineral, fub-\nftances, and points their refpeCtive ufes, for the lafting profit and ad\u00ad\nvantage of mankind.\nHaving thus Ihewn what the word Aftrology imports, and arranged its\ncomponent parts by the rules of Science, it will be feen that its colla\u00ad\nteral branches are fo extenfive and multitudinous, that mod men, of any\n3 learning\nOriginal from\nKIPA\/ Dl ID I Ir I I D D A D V\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n54\nlearning or ingenuity at all, are Tome way or other converfant in aftro-\nlogy, without appearing to know it. But the perverfenefs of human\nnature is in this inftance mod ftrikingly vilible, fince it leads mankind\nto a choice of inferior fpeculations, whilft they utterly negleCt an invefti-\ngation of thofe curious, indifcernible, infenfible, and impalpable, tracks\nof nature, which open to a field of unbounded information, calculated to\nreform the mind, and enlarge the underftanding ; and to extirpate the\nfeeds of atheifm, by leading to the mod fublime and heavenly contem\u00ad\nplations of a Supreme Being. The common objections againft engaging\nin this elevated ftudy are equally abfurd and ridiculous ; but they pro\u00ad\nceed only from thofe men who wilfully negleCt, or obftinately perfift in\na difbelief of. Nature\u2019s fecret and imperceptible works ; and yet her ope\u00ad\nrations are fo manifeft, and fo often confirmed by fatal experience, that\nit is aftonifhing mankind are not more frequently awakened by them.\nThus we fee a man inftantaneoufly taken off, by a violent and feverifh\ndiftemper, and yet no one can poflibly conceive how or from what caufe\nit proceeds ;\nnor can the moil able phyfician, by anydepth of medical \/kill,\npoint out its genuine caufe, fo as to fhew that another man under the\nfame fymptoms fhall be feized with juft fuch another diforder. But\nlook into the fick man\u2019s nativity, by the rules of Aftrology, and there\nypu will mod apparently fee the root and caufe of his affliction : and\nhence we demonftrably prove, that it was not fo much the effeCt of\ncatching cold, or of any accident, which brought on the malady, but\nthe evil influence of fome malignant afpeCt, that unperceived and unfuf-\npcfled gave the fatal blow, while a cold, or fome trifling accident, were\nbut mere inftruments ; for another man fhall have a worfe cold, and\nfcarcely find himfelf the leaft feverifh, or expofed to danger;\nThus we find Aftrology comprehends every operation that proceeds out\nof the mafter-wheel or frame of Nature, and furnifhes us with a know\u00ad\nledge of the occult virtues of all earthly fubftances, and of the nature and\nend of every particle of God\u2019s Creation ; and, to minds that can relifh\nenjoyments fuperior to thofe of fenfe, nothing can furnifh more noble\nand exalted pleafures than a contemplation and ftudy of thefe immenfe\nworks ; while nothing furely can give greater proof's of an abjeCt and\ncontracted mind, than to be daily converfant with, and yet ftupidly in\u00ad\nfenfible of, the amazing miracles of nature. The fun, moon, and ftars,\nwere not made by a wife and beneficent Creator, that the wonders of\nthem fhould open themfelves to eyes that fee not, or difplay their in\u00ad\nfluences unregarded to the incurious inhabitants of the earth. It was in\u00ad\ndeed principally for the pleafure of Him by whom all things exift, that\nthey arc and were created; who rejoiceth in his works\u2014in furveying that\nftrutture which omnipotence alone could raife; but they are likewife de-\nfigned\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM P \/ i f v n e k ' Dl IP I Ir I I R P A R V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 55\nfigned to communicate wifdom and happinefs, and intelle&ual and mo\u00ad\nral improvement, to mankind. And to him, who is not barely fatisfied\nwith an external admiration of things, they will fuggcft fuch reflexions\nas will make him both wifer and better ; for, at the fame time that they\nfeaft his imagination, they will enlarge his underftanding, and meliorate his\nheart. Whatever part ofthe works of nature we caft our eyes upon, we {hall\nfind imprinted therein ample lefl'ons of ioftruCtion and improvement.\nWould we comtemplate the inexpreffible greatnefs and majefty of God, let\nus but look up and furvey the heavens, which are fpread over us like a cur\u00ad\ntain; they declare the glory of God, and work\u2014they vifi-\nbly \u00a3hew it forth to the rude and illiterate ; but the mind which is fraught\nwith thiscomprehenfive ftudy may for ever expand itfelf in the immenfity\nof the profpeX. Even the irrational and inanimate part of the creation\narc held forth by the wifdom of God to direX the Beings of Reafon in\nthe way that they {hould go ; and our Saviour in his parables defeends to\nthe lifelefs emblems of feed fown, of the fig-tree, and of a Angle grain\nof muftard-feed, toenlighten the underftandingof mankind. Is it not then\nthe duty of every rational creature to improve by this divine example, and,\nby a ftudy of that excellent part of Aftrology called natural philofophy,\nto increafe.our imperfeX knowledge in the fubjeXs of creation? Such\nknowledge as this lies open even to the way-faring man ; it grows in every\nfield, and meets us in all our paths; and, as it is moft important to be\nwell underftood by the reader before any material progrefs can be made\nin the Aftrology of the heavens, I {hall conclude thefe obfervations with\na fliort introduction to the ftudy of Nature.\nK A Summary\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM P 1\nA\/ V f l D V DI IDI I T I I D D\n\f5$ A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nA Summary V IE W of the W O R K S of C R E A T I O N , in the\nC O N S T R U C T I O N of N A T U R E .\nN\nATURE is that which God has ordained Emprefs over all the\nWorks of his Creation, and over every part of the Celeftial and\nTerreftrial World. This world comprehends both the Heaven and\nthe Earth, and is compounded of three fcparate and diftindt parts, which\nare all'o called Worlds, namely, an Elementary world, which is the low-\neft in dignity; a Celeftial world, which is next above the elementary;\nand an Etherial world, which is the higheft of all ; and thefe three lefs\nworlds, make the one entire Great World. In the order of Nature, the\nall-wile and fupreme Being has ordained that every inferior Ihould be\ngoverned by its fuperior; and by this eternal decree, the Intellectual\nworld aduates and governs the Celeftial, which confifts of the fun,\nmoon, and ftars, and all the holt of heaven; and the Celeftial world\naduates and governs the Elementary world, and all elementary bodies,\nwhether animal, mineral, or vegetable.\nThe Elementary world is compofed of the four elements, Fire, Air,\nEarth, and Water, of which all things peculiar to the elementary world\nare generated; but thele elements, in the ftate wecommonly find them, are\nnot pure, butintermixed with each other; and they often change oneinto\nthe other by nature, as fire turns into fmoke, and fmoke into air, and air\ninto water, &c. Each of thefe elements has likewife two fpecific qua\u00ad\nlities, viz. fire is hot and dry, water is cold and moift, air is hot and\nmoift, and the earth is cold and dry j fo that fire is inimical to water,\nand air to earth. Thefe elements alfo pofTefs three eflential proper\u00ad\nties inherent in themfelves, viz. air has motion, thinnefs, and darknefs;\nfire has motion, brightnefs, and thinnefs ; water has motion, darknefs,\nand thicknefs; and earth has darknefs, thicknefs, and quietnefs ; fo that\nfire is twice more thin than air, thrice more moveable, and four times\nmore bright ; air is twice more bright, three times more thin, and four\ntimes more moveable, than water ; water is twice more bright, thrice\nmore thin, and four times more moveable, than earth ; as therefore fire is\nto air, fo is air to water, and water to earth ; and vice , as earth is to\nwater, fo is water to air, and air to fire. Three of thefe elements have\nmotion, and are aCtive ; but the earth is fixed and pafiive, and only fup-\nplies matter for the other elements to aCt upon ; for as nothing can be\nproduced unlefs matter be fubminiftered, fo of neceffity one element\nmuft fubminifter that matter for the operation of the others : and no\ninfluence could be difpenfed by the heavens, unlefs there were elementary\nbodies\nDigitized by Got. sle Original from\nM\nC\nU\n\/ vnDF D\nl IPIIr IIDDA\nD\nV\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 57\nbodies to receive their influence j therefore every adtive principle muft of\nneceflity be in motion, and every paflive principle muft be at.reft. And\naccordingly, as the a&ive elements find the earth that they a<ft upon\nto be pure, or impure, fo will the work be that is produced. The\nearth can bring forth nothing of itfelf, but is the womb or matrix into\nwhich the other elements diftil or projed their feminal virtues ; and in\nproportion as it is impregnated by their force and energy, it brings forth,\naccording to the due courfc of nature. The Earth alfo receives the cc-\nleftial rays and influences of all the heavenly bodies, as ordained by God,\nto be the objedt, fubjedt, and receptacle of them ; whereby it not only\nbrings forth what is intended to be produced, but alfo multiplies what-\nit receives, and feparates the good from the bad, and the pure from the\nimpure. It likewife contains the feeds or feminal virtues of all elemen\u00ad\ntary bodies, and hath a triplicity in itfelf, viz. mineral, animal, and ve-\ngetive. It is the common fountain or mother from whence all things\nfpring, whofe fruitfulnefs is produced by the three-fold operation of fire,,\nair, and water. And, as thefe elementary bodies poflefs moft extraordi\u00ad\nnary qualities, it will be proper to confider each of them diftindtly, and.\nto explain their feveral properties more at large.\nFire, the firft adtive element, is an el^ftic body, compofed of infinite\u00ad\nly fmall particles, fcarcely, if at all, adhering to each other, and a body in\nmotion. It is in efFed, the univerfal inftrument of all the motion and.\nadtion in the univerfe j without fire, all bodies would become immove\u00ad\nable, as in a fevere winter we adtually fee our fluids become folid for want\nof it. Without fire a man w'ould harden into a ftatue, and the very air\nwould cohere into a firm rigid mafs. Fire then is the foie caufe of all.\nmutation or changej for all mutation is by motion, and all motion by\nfire. Upon the abfence of only a certain degree of fire, all oils, fats,\nwaters, wines, ales, fpirits of wine, vegetables, and animals, become,,\nhard, rigid, and inert; and the lefs the degree of fire, the fooner is this\ninduration made. Hence, if there were the greateft degree of cold, and\nall fire was abfolutely taken away, all nature would grow into one con\u00ad\ncrete body, folid a$ gold, and hard as diamond; but upon the re-ap\u00ad\nplication of fire, it would recover its former mobility. So that upon\nthis one element of fire, depends all fluidity of humours and juices; alfo\nall vegetation, putrefadion, fermentation, animal heat, and a thoufand\nother things. Fire is in itfelf but one, though it centers in divers places.\nIt centers in the heavens, and is boundlels, where it guards and pre-\nferves nature, and enlivens all the creation, giving life, light, and mo\u00ad\ntion, to ail creatures, and ftirs them up to tecundity and fruitfulnefs. It\ncenters alfo in the earth, where it generates metals, minerals, and ftones ;\nand, by joining itfelf with the beams of the celeftial fun and moon, pro\u00ad\nduces\ng\nm\nz\ne\ndb\nyGoogle Original from\nmcmj vnck' d\ni im ir i i\n\fu\nu\ni\ni\nid\n1\n1\n1\n,\nu\nu\nu\ny\ni\ne\n-\nu\ni\ny\niu^t:u\n\/\ni\nill|j.\/\/v\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\n.i\ni\no\nl\ni\ni\ni\nli\nubi.ur\ny\/ci\nLL\nt:\nb\ni_u\nie-\nw\n-p\nu-\nyu\nu\ny\nit;\n58 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nduces vegetation upon the furface of the earth. It occasions that heat\nwe fometimes obferve in fprings and fountains ; and imparts a principle\nof its own into whatever it produces, fo that whatfoever retains life re\u00ad\ntains it by virtue of its own inclofed heat; and, whenever this is exhauft-\ned or extinguilhed, it perilhes and dies. And, as water purgeth, cleanfeth,\nand difiblveth, all things that are not fixed, fo fire purgeth and perfeCteth\nall things that are fixed ; and, as water conjoins all things that are dif-\nfolved, fo fire feparates all things that are conjoined j it caufes all feeds to\ngrow and ripen ; and, when they are ripe, it expels them by the fperm\ninto divers places of the earth ; and, as the fituation and temperature of\nthefe places are, whether hot or cold, moift or dry, pure or impure, fo\nwill the diverfity of things be both in the bowels, and upon the furface of\nthe earth. But, amongft all the wonderful properties of fire, there are\nnone more extraordinary than this ; That, though it is the principal caufe\nof almoft all the fenfible effefts that continually fall under our obferva-\ntion, yet it is in itfelf of fo infinitely a fubtle nature, that it baffles or de\u00ad\nfeats our moft fagacious enquiries, nor ever comes within the cogni\u00ad\nzance of our fenfes.\nFire may be divided into three kinds or fpecies, viz. celeftial, fubterra-\nneous, and culinary. Celeftial fire is that which is peculiar to the celeftial\nregions, where it exifts in the greateft purity and perfection, unmixed\nwith fmoke, or any of that grofs, feculent, or terreftial matter, found in\nculinary and fubterranean fire ; but allowing for this difference, the effects\nof the celeftial fire appear to be the fame as thofe of the culinary. Sub\u00ad\nterraneous fire is that which manifefts itfelf in fiery eruptions of the earth,\nvolcanoes, or burning mountains, and is always found in the more central\nparts of the earth, and often in mines and coal-pits. Culinary fire is that\nwhich we employ in all chemical operations, and in the common occafions\n\u2022of life. To afcertain the force and power of fire, the learned Boerhaave\nmade innumerable curious experiments, which enabled him to divide it\ninto fix degrees. The firft degree is that by which nature performs the\noffice of vegetation in plants, and by which chemiftry imitates and does\nthe like. This commences from the higheft degree of cold, which in\nFahrenheit\u2019s thermometer is denoted by one; and ends at eighty degrees,\nfince in this whole interval vegetables of one kind or other give indication\nof life and growth; fo that if all plants be examined by the degrees of\nheat contained within thefe limits, we fhall find all of them come to ma\u00ad\nturity in one or.other of thefe intermediate degrees. This heat is fuited\nto extracting the native fpirits of odoriferous vegetables with oils, as that\nof rofes, jeffamin, and the like. Thus the fragrant feeftt of rofes may be\n-communicated to oil, by putting the inodorous and infipid oil of olives in a\nttall clean chemical glafs, and digefting it in a heat of fifty-fix degrees*\nwith\nDigitized by Got ole Original from\nM P W V n D k \" Dl ID I I r I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 57\nwith the mod fragrant rofes, gathered juft as they are opening in a m orn\u00ad\ning; the application of a fimilar degree of heat would alfo impregnate\nalcohol with the pureft fpirit of faffron. The fecond degree of fire may\nbe accounted that of the human body in a healthy date. This degree is\nalways greater than that of the ambient air, and may be fuppofed to\ncommence at the 40th degree of the thermometer, and end about the\n94th. W ithin this compafs animals may live and fubfift, that is, if their\njuices be of any degree of heat within thefe bounds. The eggs of infeefts\nfubfift unhurt during hard winters, and hatch in the fucceeding fpring.\nFifties, both of the fea and of rivers, live in water which is only thirty-\nfour degrees warm ; and fifties that have lungs, and all refpiring animals\nin a date of health, communicate to their humours a warmth of ninety-two.\ndegrees ; and therefore the utmod limits of this degree are fixed at thirty-\nthree and ninety-four. Within the compafs of this heat are included the\nvital actions of animals; the fermentation of vegetables, and the putre\u00ad\nfaction both of vegetables and animals ; and likewife the generation,\nbreeding, hatching, birth, and nutrition, of animals. This degree is alfo\nemployed by chemids to prepare elixirs, volatile alkaline falts, and tinc\u00ad\ntures. The third degree of fire is that which extends from ninety-four\ndegrees of the thermometer to 212 ; at which lad, water ufually boils.\nThis degree is required in the didillation of finiple and compound wa\u00ad\nters, the eflential oils of vegetables ; and will coagulate or confolidate the\nferurn, blood, and other animal juices, and confequently dedroy life.\nThe fourth degree of heat may by reckoned from the degree 212 to 600\nwithin which limits all oils, faline lixivia, mercury, and oil of vitriol, are\ndidilled ; lead and tin will alfo melt and mix together. The oils, falts,\nand faponaceous juices, of animals and vegetables, are rendered volatile and\nacrid, and become more or lefs alcalel'cent; their folid parts are calcined,\nand lofe their didinguiftnng qualities and proper virtues; and with this\ndegree of fire, fofiil lulphur and fal armoniac are fublimed. The fifth\ndegree is that wherein the other metals melt, and which commences from\nfix hundred degrees of the thermometer, and ends where iron is held in a\nftate of fufion. In this degree moft bodies are deftroyed ; but glafs, gold,\nfilver, copper, and iron, remain long unchanged ; all other fixed bodies\ngrow red-hot in this degree, and all the unvitrifiable ftones are calcined.\nThe fixth and higheft degree of fire hitherto known, is that of the bura-\ning lens, or fpeculum, by M. Villette, Tfchirnhaufen, BufFon, and others.\nThe focus of thefe lenfes will even volatilize what is called the metalline\nor mercurial part of gold, and vitrify the more terreftrial. The utmoft\ndegree of fire is the vitrification of fixed bodies, which the ancient magi,\nor the aftrologers of the eaft, difeovered; and they predicted the final\nend of the world by fire, and its mutation into tranfparent glafs.\nAir is the next adtive element that engages our attention, and it is d i\u00ad\nvided into proper or e\nl\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nr\ny,and common or Elementary\nNo. 3.

It likewife enters into the compofition of moftor perhaps .\nall bodies, and exifts in them under a folid Tromf^ deprived of its elaf- i,\nticity, and moft of its diftinguifhing properties, and ferving as the ce- ^\nment, and univerfal bond, of nature; but capable, by certain procefles,\nof being difengaged from them, recovering its elafticity, and refembling\nthe air of our atmofphere. The peculiar nature of this aerial matter we\nknow but little of; what authors have advanced concerning it being\nchiefly conjeft ural. We have no way of altogether feparating it from the\nother matter, with which, in its pureft ftate, it is more or left combined,\nand confequently no way of afcertaining, with fatisfadtory evidence, its\npeculiar properties, abftradledly from thofe of other bodies. Philofophers\nboth ancientand modern maintain, with great plaufibility, that it is the fame\n\"with the pure ether, or that fine, fluid, adtive, matter, diflfufed through the\nwhole expanfe of the celeftial regions, and of the interior heavens; and\nis fuppofed to be a body fuigeneris, ingenerable, incorruptible, immuta\u00ad\nble, prefent in all places and in all bodies.\nCommon or heterogeneous air is a coalition of corpufcles of various\nkinds, which together conftitute one common mafs, wherein we live and\nmove, and which we are continually receiving and expelling by refpiration.\nThe whole aflemblage of this makes what we call th and\nwhere this air or atmofphere ends, there the pure ether is fuppofed to\ncommence, which is diftinguifhed from air, by its not making any fenfi-\nble refradtion of the rays of light, as air does. This common air, fays\nflows into it from the heavenly bodies, and probably the magnetic effluvia\nof the earth, whatever fire can volatilize, is found in the air. Hence the\nwhole foil'll kingdom mult be.found in i t ; for all of that tribe, as falts,\nfulphurs, ftones, and metals, are convertible into fume, and thus capable\nof being rendered part of the air. Gold itfelf, the moft fixed of all na\u00ad\ntural bodies, is found to adhere clofe to the fulphur in mines; and thus to\nbe raifed along with it. Sulphurs alfo make a confidcrable ingredient of\nthe air, on account of the many volcanoes, grottos, caverns, and other\n(piracies, chiefly affording that mineral, difperl'ed through the globe. All\nparts of the animal kingdom mult alfo be in the air; for, befide the co\u00ad\npious effluvia continually emitted from their bodies, by the vital heat, in\nthe ordinary procefs of perfpiration, by means of which an animal, in-the\ncourfe of its duration, impregnates the air with many times the quantity\nof its own body; we find that any animal when dead, being expofed to\nthe air, is in a certain time wholly incorporated with it.

This fhip was heeled on her fide for the purpofe of\nfome repair, when the water rufhed into her lower port-holes, and funk\nher almoft inftantaneoufly. She went down in fourteen fathom water,\nand fell upon her fide, as was evident from her top-mafts, which remain\u00ad\ned above the water in an inclined dirediion. A confiderable time after\nthis fatal accident, fhe fuddenly righted, and her mads became nearly\nperpendicular. Noone couldaccountforthis extraordinary circumftance,\ntill an anonymous writer publifhed the following ingenious and corredt\nTolution of i t :\u2014 \u201c By the mufter-roll of this unfortunate fhip, it appears\nthat 495 fouls perifhed between her decks ; and, as the bodies had nd\nway to efcape, they of courfe remained in that fituation. Now all bodies\nin a date of putrefaction ferment, and this fermentation generates large\nquantities of air, fo that a putrifying carcafe, inflated by the generation\nof air, expands itfelf to a fize far exceeding its original bulk, and becomes\nlighter than water in a very high degree ; and will confequently be prefled\nupwards towards thefurface with a power equal to the weight of a quantity\nof water adequate in bulk to the inflated carcafe; and would rile imme\u00ad\ndiately to thefurface in a perpendicular line, if not obftrudted in its paf-\nfage. Now it is obvious that the 495 carcafes, which lay between the\ndecks until fermentation and putrefaction commenced, would rife as foon\nas the generated air rendered them fpecifically lighter than fea-water : and,\nas fermentation increafed their bulk, they would, by their expanfion, re\u00ad\nmove a quantity of water from between the decks, on the lowed fide of\nthe fhip (to which by their gravity they would naturally incline when\ntheir breath firft left them),equal to their encreafed bulk; and, being then\nadled upon by the upward preflure of the water, would exert againft the\nunder-part of the decks, immediately over them, a power likewife equal\nto fuch weight of water as equals their increafed bulk. The heavieft fide\nof the fhip, being thus firfl lightened by the difplacing fo large a quan\u00ad\ntity of water, and exchanging it for air j and then adled upon by the\npreflure of the water upwards againfi: the under fide of the inflated carca\u00ad\nfes, lifting hard againft the decks on or beneath the center of the fhip.;\nand farther by the preflure of the water upwards, againfi the underfide of\nthe hulls, mails, &c. together with the counterpoife of a large weight\nof water between decks, on the higheft fide, would caufe her to be near\u00ad\nly.in equilibrio; and confequently, the firfl flrong tide (as was the cafe)\nwould fwing her on her keel, and right her.\u201d\nAs to vegetables, none of that clafs can be wanting in the contribution of\ntheir effluvia to the commonair, fince we know that all vegetables, by pu-\ntrefadlion, become volatile.

Thus air is one of\nthe moil confiderable and univerfal agents in all nature, being concerned\nin the prefervation of life, and the production of mod of the phenomena\nrelating to this world. Its properties andeffeCts, includinga great part of\nthe refearches and difcover|es of the modern1philofophers, have in a con\u00ad\nfiderable degree been reduced to precife laws anddemonftrations ; in which\nform they make a very extenfive and important branch of the mixed ma\u00ad\nthematics, called Pneumatics ; for a more perfect knowledge of which,\nI beg leave to recommend the curious reader to Dr. Prieftley\u2019s invaluable\nExperiments and Obfervations on different kinds of air. But I fhall juft\nobferve further, that to the prefTure of air we are to attribute the cohe\u00ad\nrence of the parts of bodies. Breathing too, on which depends animal\nlife, is owing to the prefTure and lpring of the air; and to the lame\ncjufe may be attributed the production of fire and flame, as appears from\nthe fudden extinction of fire when deprived of air. It is likewife necef-\nlary for the exiftenceand propagation of founds, for the germination and\ngrowth of plants, for conveying all the variety of l'mells, and for re\u00ad\nceiving and tranfmitting the rays and influences of the celeftial world to\nthe terreftial. Air aCts upon all bodies by its common properties of\nweight and elafticity, and by the peculiar virtues of the ingredients where\u00ad\nof it is compofed. Thefe properties of weight and elafticity in the air,\nwhen engendered in large quantities in the bowels of the earth, and\nheated by the fubterranean fire, occafion earthquakes, and other vehe\u00ad\nment commotions of nature. And by fome late experiments of M. de la\nHire, it is found that a certain quantity of condenfed air, if heated to a\ndegree equal to that of boiling water, would produce an exploiion fuffi-\ncicnt to tear afunder the folid globe. By means of a corroding acid, air\ndifiolves iron and copper, unlcfs well defended by oil ; even gold in the\nchemift\u2019s laboratory, when the air is impregnated with theeffluvia of aqua\nregia, contracts a ruft like other bodies. It fixes volatile bodies, and vo\u00ad\nlatilizes thole which are fixed. From the different effluviae diffufed\nthrough the air proceed a variety of cffeCts. Near mines of copper, it\nwill dilcolour iilver and brafs ; and in London, where the air abounds\nwith acid and corrciive particles, metalline utenfils ruft much fooner than\nin the country. Stones alio undergo the changes incident to metals.\nThus Purbeck ftone, of which Salifbury cathedral is built, is obferved\nto become gradually fofter, and to moulder away in the air ; and Mr.\nBoyle gives the fame account of Blackington ftone. It is very difficult\nto obtain oil of fulphur in a clear dry air, as its parts are then more ready\nto evaporate ; but in a moift cloudy air it may be obtained in abundance.\nAll falts melt moft readily in cloudy weather ; and feparations proceed beft\nin the fame ftate of the air. If pure wane becarried into a place where the\nair is full of the fumes of wine then fermenting, it will begin to ferment\na-frefh. The wholefomenefs and unwholefomenefs of air is certainly\n2 owing\nDigitized by G o o g l e\nOriginal from\nMCI\/!\/ v n o k ' Dl IP I Ir I I R D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y * 63\nowing to the different effluvia with which it abounds. The beft air is to\nbe found in open champaign countries, where the foil is dry, and fpon-\ntaneoufly produces wild thyme, wild marjoram, and the like fweet-\nfeented plants. The morning air is more refrefhing than that of the even\u00ad\ning, and air agitated with breezes than that which is ferene and ftill.\nAs good air contributes greatly to health, fo that which is bad or in\u00ad\nfectious is no lei's prejudicial to it, as is evident in contagious difeafes,\nplagues, murrains, and other mortalities, which are fpread by an infedted\nair. But this infefcted air may be corrected, and the body preferved from\nits fatal effects, by the effluvia of aromatic and ffrong-feented herbs and\nflowers. From obfervations on bleeding in rheumatifms, and after tak\u00ad\ning cold, it is evident the air can enter with all its qualities, and vitiate\nthe whole texture of the blood, and other juices. From pallies, verti\u00ad\ngoes, and other nervous affections, caufed by damps, mines, &c. it is\nevident that air thus qualified, can relax and obftruCt the whole nervous\nfyftem. And from the cholics, fluxes, coughs, and confumptions, pro\u00ad\nduced by damp, moift, and nitrous, air, it is evident it can corrupt and\nfpoil the noble organs of the whole human ftruCture. Thus air is an\ninftrument which nature is univerfally applying in all her works, con-\nfequently a knowledge of its properties icems highly neceflary not only\nto the chemift and phyfician, but to the philofopher and divine.\u2014 For\nmore on this important fubjedl fee Hales\u2019s Veget.

Pure Water, which is a limpid and colournefs li\u00ad\nquor, without fmell or tafle, Ample and volatile, and is peculiar to the\nceleftial regions. Secondly, Grofs Water, which is a pellucid fluid, con\u00ad\nvertible into ice by cold, naturally pervading the flrata of the earth, and\nflowing on its furfacey and with the body of the earth conflitutes the\nterraqueous globe. The Agure of the component parts of water appears\nto be fmooth and fpherical, like thofe of quickfllver; whence it becomes\nextremely moveable and penetrating. Thus it readily enters the pores of\nwood, leather, ikins, chords, and muflcal firings, and is capable of\nmoving and agitating particles of matter lefs adtive than itfelf; and fo\nproves the more immediate phyAcal agent of fermentation, putrefadlion,\nfolution, and the like ; and thus it alfo conveys earthy and faline matter\nthrough flltres of paper, ftone, &c. and even raifes fome proportion of\nthem in diffillations. Its particles appear to be extremely minute, and\nfo have a large fhare of furface. Hence water is admirably fitted for a\nNo. 3.

It penetrates the atmofphere very copioully, by means of the\ncontinual diftillations of the ocean and rivers, railed up by the heat of\nthe central fun, and draws along with it a warm unfiious vapour, which\ncaufes a natural generation of whatever the earth, as a matrix, is impreg\u00ad\nnated with. Water always contains an earthy fubllance, and is found in\nthe hardell bodies, and in the dried air. It is the proper menftruum.\nof falts, and, by the readinefs with which it imbibes the different\nkinds of air, is eafily rendered, by a lately-difcovered chemical procefs, to\npoffefs the lame qualities and virtues of the mod edeemed mineral waters\nhitherto difcovered. Water is alfo of infinite ufe in all the works both\nof nature and art, as without it there could be no generation, nutri\u00ad\ntion, or accretion, performed in any of the animal, vegetable, mine\u00ad\nral, marine, or atmofpherical, regions. The blood could not flow in the\nveins, the fap in the veflfcls of vegetables, nor the particles of minerals\nconcrete and grow together, without water. It is this that makes the\nlarged part of our blood, our drink, and other aliments. There could\nbe no corruption, fermentation, or diflolution, carried on without i t ; no\nbrewing, no diddling, no wines, no vinegar, no fpirits, made without\nit. We alfo meet with water under an infinite variety of forms, and in an\ninfinite variety of bodies, as that of air, vapour, clouds, fnow, hail, ice,\nlap, wines, blood, flefh, bone, horn, done, and other bodies, through\nall which it feems to pafs unaltered, as an agent or indrument that dif\u00ad\nfers no alteration by re-adtion, but remains capable of refuming the form\nof water again upon any occafion. In its own common date, water ap\u00ad\npears to be a combination of all the elements together, as containing a\nquantity of fire, which keeps it fluid ; a quantity of air, and a quantity\nof earth; whence it is not at all furpriling, that water alone, as it appears\nto the lenfes, fhould fufEce for vegetation in fome cafes, where little\nearth is wanted, or for fupporting animal and mineral life, where no great\ndegree of nutriment is required; and hence it proves a glue or cement to\ndime bodies, a folvent to others; thus it confolidates brick, plaider\nof Paris, done, bone, and the like; but diflolves falts, and fubtile earth\napproaching to falts, and becomes the indrumental caufe of their adtion.\nWater alfo conveys nourilhment or a more fixed and folid matter to the\n.parts of vegetables, where having depofited it, the finer fluid perfpires\ninto the atmofphere, which gives us the phyfical caufe of the dampnefs and\nunwholefomenefs of woody countries, as they remarkably find in America.\nFor all large vegetables aft after the manner of forcing-pumps, continu\u00ad\nally drawing in krge quantities of water at their roots, and difeharging\nit\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM C U \/ v n D V Dl ID I i r I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y , 65\nit at their leaves; which intimates a method of colleding water in dry\ncountries* and likewife of making fait water frelh. It is alfo obferva-\nble, that water in paffing through plants, after having depofited its more\nterreftrial part, does not always go off pure, but impregnated with the\nfiner effluvia, or more fubtile particles, of the vegetable; thus making an\natmofphere around every plant according to its nature, odoriferous or o-\ntherwife, which fupplies us with a rule for procuring the odoriferous\nwaters of vegetables by diftillation. But the particles, not fine enough\nto go off thus along with the water, are left behind upon the furface of\nthe leaves and flowers of plants, being now thickened or drained from\ntheir moiffer parts, and remaining in the form of honey, manna, gums,\nor balfams, according to the nature of the vegetable. And hence we\ndeduce the phyfical caufe why plants prove more odoriferous and fweet\nwhen the air is both warm and moifl, as is the cafe immediatly after a\nfummer fliower. Water is likewife of the utmoft ufe in divers of\nthe mechanical arts and occafions of lifej as in the motion of mills,\nengines, fountains, aud all other machines which ad by the laws of\nHydroftatics.\u2014For the further properties and effects of Water, fee\nDefag.

It muft be obferved, that pure native earth\nis a very different matter from the earth whereon we tread, and this pure\nearth is fuppofed to be the bafis or fubftratem of all bodies, and that\nwherein the other principles refide. It is all that is folid in an animal\nor vegetable body, all the real vafcular parts, the reft being juices. This\nearth may be found in and feparated from all animal and vegetable fub-\nftances, and is the fame in all, and is the bafis of all. It remains after\nthe feparation of the other principles, by chemiftry, from all animal and\nvegetable fubftances, and neither coheres together, nor fuffers any change\nin the fire. The affayers acknowledge no difference between the earth of\nanimals and vegetables, but make their tefts for the niceft ufes equally of\nboth. If water be poured upon this earth, it requires fome degree of te\u00ad\nnacity, fo as to become capable of being formed into veffels ; but, if oil\nhe added, it coheres into a much ftronger and more compaft mafs; hence\nit appears that oil and earth are the principles which give conliftence and\ntenacity to plants. This oil, as well as this earth, feems the fame in all,\nand polreffes nothing of the poifonous or medicinal virtues of the plaut,\nor whatever it is extraded from j they being all feparable by decodion,\ndiftillation., and other proceffcs of that kind, and never remain either in\nthe\nDigitized by Go< gle Original from\nM P U \/ Dl ID I i r I I RB A B V\n\fp>iFinnfi-nrl-w-p><;n\nqq^-v^p\/Pi\nm\nn\n<\n;n\nm\ni\nn\np\ni\nr\nAAAAAA\/\/:rlni\ni\n\/\nnp>\n7\nn\nifiin\n-p\n>\nif\nin\nn\nn\n'i\n11pi\ni\ni\nn\nn\nDigitiz\n66 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe earth, or in this connecting oil.

Hence man is called' the Microcofm, from ^p\u00a9-,\nlittle, and w o r l d ,\nliterally fignifying, the little world, which\nplied to Man by way of eminence, as being an epitome of all that is excel\u00ad\nlent and wonderful in Nature.

For the fenfual, ce\u00ad\nleftial, part of man, is that whereby we move, fee, feel, tafte, and fmell,\nand have a commerce with all material objects ; and through thefe the\ninfluences of the divine Nature are conveyed to the more refined and\nfenfible organs. This celeftial fpirit adfuates and influences the elemen\u00ad\ntary eflence, andftirs it up to the propagationofits like, and to every other\npurpofe for which Nature defigned it. And this fpirit is even difcoverable\nin herbs and flowers, which open when <he fun rifes, and clofe when he\nfets ; whichmotion is produced by the fpirit being fenfible of the approach\nand departure of the fun\u2019s influence. Next to thefe, in Man, fhines that\npure, etherial, angelic part, called the rational foul; which is a divine\nlight or ftream flowing immediately from the Great Creator, uniting\nMan with God, and railing him above all other parts of animated na\u00ad\nture. This Soul, when once it enters the body, runs parallel with\neternity ; and joins in with the celeftial fpirit, through the fphere of the\nplanets; and is conducted by a divine genius, to an hypoftatical union\nwith the elementaty body ; fo that there exift two active principles in\nthe body of man to one paflive ; and, as the Superior Rules in the celef\u00ad\ntial world are fituated at the time of man\u2019s nativity, fo will his confti-\ntution and difpofition be framed. And here we derive the caufc of all\nthofeaftonifhing variations of temper, difpofition, andconftitution, which\nare^rot only peculiar to different fubjedfs, but even to one and the fame\nperfon j for every one will bear tcftimony of this fadt, that we find our-\nielves fometimes chearful, and at other times melancholy; to-day in perfedl\nhealth, and to-morrow in pain and anguifh; this hour compofed, affa\u00ad\nble, and complapmt, and the next aultere, petulant, and peremptory ;\nand thefe contrarieties are evidently produced by the continual refiftance\nand oppofition of the four elements in man's body, which alternately dif-\npofe him to the various affedtions difcoverable in human nature. The\ncaufe of this is induced from the natural enmity of the elementary mat\u00ad\nter, viz. heat and cold, and drinefs and moifture ; each of which occa-\nfionally predominates in man\u2019s body, according to the motion and influ\u00ad\nence of thofe heavenly bodies, that rule, govern, and modify, the operation\nof the four elements, in and upon every terreftrial fubftance. Thus it is\nevident, that the underftanding and intelledlual faculties of Man are form\u00ad\ned of the ethereal world; the fenfitive powers of life and adtion are derived\nfrom the celeftial world j and the grofs and corruptible part, the flelhand\nblood, confifts of the elementary world ; which are all fubordinate the\none to the other. Under this idea of the workmanfhip and conftrufclion\nof Man, Job exclaimed, that he was fearfully and wonderjully made ; in\n-ift poffeffing the three-fold eflences of fpirit, loul, and body.\nNo. 3.

But thefe tenets are fo ex\u00ad\ntremely abfurd, fo vague, and fo deftitute of evidence, that the rational\nmind is at a lofs to conceive howfuch an inconfiftent doftrine coaid have\neverbeen broached; for, the fame philofophical reafoning, thatenables us\nto define the nature and exiftence of the body, will likewife prove the\nnature and exiftence of the foul. It is only from the primary or effential\nqualities of body, its extenfion, and folidity, that we form any idea of\ni t ; and why may we not form the complex idea of a foul or fpirit, from\nthe operations of thinking, underftanding, willing, and the like, which\nare experiments in ourfelves ? This idea of an immaterial fubftance is as\nclear as that we have of a material one ; for, though the notion of imma\u00ad\nterial fobftances may be attended with difficulties, we have no more\nreafon to deny or doubt of its truth, than we have to deny or doubt\nof the exiftence of the body. That the foul is an immaterial fub\u00ad\nftance, appears from hence-\u2014that the primary operations of willing and\nthinking are not only unconnected with the known properties of body,\nbut feem plainly inconfiftent with fome of its mod elfential qualities.\nFor the mind not only difcovers no relation between thinking and the\nmotion and arrangement of parts; but it'likewife perceives, thatconciouf-\nnefs, a fimple aCl, can never proceed from a compounded fubftance* ca\u00ad\npable of being divided into many parts. To illuftrate this, let us only\nfuppofe a fyftem of matter endowed with thought; then, either all the\nparts of which this fyftem conlifts muft think, which would make it\nnot one, but a multitude of diftinCt confcious beings ;*or its power of\nthinking muft arile from the connection of the parts one with another,\ntheir motion, and difpofition, which, all taken together, contribute to the\nproduction of thought. But it is evident, that the motion of parts, and\nthe manner of combining them, can produce nothing but an artful ftruc-\nture, and various modes of motion. Hence all machines, however artful\u00ad\nly their parts are put together, and however complicated their ftruc-\nture, though we conceive innumerable different motions, varioufly com\u00ad\nbined, and running one into another with an endlefs variety, yet ne\u00ad\nver produce any thing but figure and motion. If a clock, or watch, tells\nthe hour and minute of the day, it is only by the motion of the different\nhands, pointing fuccefiively at the different figures marked upon the\ndial-plate for that purpofe. We never imagine this to be the effeCt of\nthought or intelligence, nor conceive it poflible, by any refinement of\nftruCture, fo to improve thecompofition, as that it (hall become capable\nof knowledge and confcioufnefs; and the reafon is plainly this, that\nthought\nDigitized by G O O g l C\nOriginal from\nM P A \/ V r t R k ' Dl IPI i r I I R R A B V\n\fof? A S T R O L O G Y . ' 69\nthought being fomething altogether different from motion and figure,\nwithout the leaft connexion between them, it can never be fuppofed to\nrefult from them. This then being evident, that intelligence cannot\narife from an union or combination of unintelligent parts j if we fuppofe\nit to belong to any fyftem of matter, we muft n eeflarily attribute it to\nall the parts of which that fyftem is compofed; whereby, inftead of one,\nwe (hall, as was before obferved, have a multitude of diftinCt confcious\nbeings. And becaufe matter, how far foever we purlue the minutenefs\nof its parts, is ftill capable of repeated divilions, even to infinity, it is\nplain that this abfurdity will follow us through all the fuppofitions that\nmake thought inherent in a material fubftance. Wherefore, as confci-\noufnefs is incompatible with the cohefion of folid feparable parts, we are\nneceffarily led to place it in fome other fubftance of diflinfl Nature and\nProperties\u2014and this fubftance we call Spirit, which is altogether diftinCt\nfrom body, nay, and commonly placed in oppolition to it ; for which\nreafon, the beings of this clafs are called immaterial ; a word that im\u00ad\nplies nothing of their true nature, but merely denotes its contrariety to\nthat of matter, or material fubftances.\nAs to the immortality of the human foul, the arguments to prove it\nmay be reduced to the following heads ; firft, The nature of the foul it-\nfelf, its defires, fenfe of moral good and evil, and gradual increafe of\nknowledge and perfection ; and fecondly, The moral attributes of God.\nUnder the former of thefe confiderations, it is apparent that the foul, be\u00ad\ning an immaterial intelligent fubftance, as has been already proved, does\nnot depend upon the body for its exiftence ; and therefore may, and ab-\nfolutely muft, exift after the body, unlefs annihilated by the fame power\nwhich gave it a being at firft, which is not to be fuppofed, fince there are\nno inftances of annihilation in nature. This argument, efpecially if the\ninfinite capacity of the foul, its ftrong defire after immortality, its ra\u00ad\ntional activity and advancement towards perfection, be likewife confidered,\nwill appear perfectly conclufive to men of a philolophical turn ; becaule\nnature, or rather the God of nature, does nothing in vain. But argu\u00ad\nments drawn from the moral attributes of the Deity are not only better\nadapted to convince men unacquainted with abftraCt reafoning, but equally\ncertain and conclufive with the former; for, as the juftice of God can\nnever fuffer the wicked to efcape unpunifhed, nor the good to remain\nalways unrewarded ; therefore arguments drawn from the manifeft and\ncontinual profperity of the wicked, and the frequent misfortunes and un-\nhappinefs of good and virtuous men in this life, muft convince every\nthinking perfon, that there is a future ftate wherein all will be fet right,\nand God\u2019s attributes of wifdom, goodnefs, and juftice, fully vindicated.\nHad the religious and confciewtious part of mankind no hopes of a future\nftate, -they would be of all men the moft miferable; but, as this is abfo-\nlutcly\nOriginal from\nM P A \/ v n ( 3 ^ D I I D I If\u201d I I B B A B V\n\fu\nu\nn\ni\nc\nm\ni,\nu\nu\nu\ny\ni\ne\n-\nu\ni\ny\ni\nu\n^\ne\nu\n\/\ni\ni\nl\nl\n|\nj\n:\n\/\n\/\nw\nw\nw\n.\ni\niciu\niiu\nu\nb\nL\n.u\ni\ny\/dLL.t:bb_ubt:-\u00ab-pu-yuuy\nit:\nA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nlutely inconfiftent with the moral charadlerer of the Deity, the certainty\nof fuch a ftate is clear to a demonftration.\nThus far we have confidered the elementary world, which is the lowed:\nin dignity j and man, the chief fubjedt thereof. The celeftial world,\nwhich is next in eminence, is conftituted of a body natural, mod: Simple,\nfpherical, clear, fluid, and moving conftantlyiti acircle, and this by virtue\nof an innate power always within itfelf; comprehending and containing\nthe lun, moon, planets, and ftars, fixed in diftindt orbs by the great Ar\u00ad\nchitect of Nature, and bearing fympathy with all terreftrial fubftances, as\nbeing formed out of the fame chaotic mafs at the beginning of the world.\nThis celeftial heaven is what Mofes calls d\na\nk\ni\ng\nnt\nhe firmament, wh\nthe work of the fecond day\u2019s creation, and literally fignifies an expahfe or\nextenjion; a term very well adapted by the prophet to the imprefiion\nwhich the heavens make on our fenfes ; whence in other parts of the\nScriptures, the heaven is compared to a curtain, or a tent flxetched out to\ndwell in. Through the medium of this celeftial world, and the heavenly\nbodies therein contained, the fupreme Being rules, governs, and actuates,\nthe elementary world ;and this is apparent, becaufe that thing w\nterm obedience is only to be found in elementary bodies. And finee mo\u00ad\ntion is the caufe of all mutation and change, and as all motion originates\nwith the heavenly bodies, by the revolutions of which even Time itfelf\nis meafured out and divided, fo we find thel'e celeftial influences produce\nall the variations of heat and cold, drinefs and moifture, generation and\ncorruption, increafe and decreafe, life and death, and all the viciffitudes\nof nature, without even varying themfelves, or being fubjedt to the leaft\nchange or alteration j whilft the elementary bodies are perpetually chang\u00ad\ning, and never continue in one ftay. Hence it is apparent that the celef\u00ad\ntial bodies are adlive, and the elementary paflive; fo that the celeftial bo\u00ad\ndies give the form and ftamp to all the productions of nature, and the ele\u00ad\nmentary bodies fubminifter matter to receive this form. And as the pofi-\ntions and aftedtions of the heavenly afpedts are when this form or ftamp\nis given, and as the quality of the elementary matter fhall be when fubmi-\nniftered, fo will the nature and quality of the fubjedl be, that receives this\nceleftial form or ftamp. And, were it not for this adtiveand paflive prin\u00ad\nciple, then would all elementary things be alike, without a pofiibility of\nexifting. It is, therefore, a perfedt knowledge of this mediate or celef\u00ad\ntial world, its various affedtions and difpofitions, the nature, tendency,\nand eftedt, of the luminaries, their motions, afpedls, and pofitions, which\nenable us to judge of future contingencies, and to difcover the fecretand\nabftrufe operations of nature. But, to attain this knowledge in any com\u00ad\npetent degree, we muft trace thefe heavenly intelligencers throughout the\nwhole celeftial regions, and acquaint ourfelves with their general and\nelfential\nDigitized by\n*Goosle Original from\nM P A i V n D t ' Dl IP I I r I I D D A D V\n\fo f a s t r o l o g y . 71\neffential qualities. I (hall for this purpofe, after treating of the ethereal\nworld, make this fpeculation a leading clue to the art of calculating\nnativities.\nThe ethereal world, which is the fuperior, and the higheft in dignity,\nis that which the infpired writers, and the ancient philofophers, called\nthe Empyrean Heaven, and is conceived to be the abode of God, and blef-\nfed fpirits, of angels, and the fouls of the righteous departed j wherein\nthe Deity is pleafed to afford a nearer and more immediate view of himfelf,\na more fenfible manifeftation of his glory, and a more adequate percep\u00ad\ntion of his attributes, than in the other parts of the univerfe, where he\nis likewife prefent. But the mod exalted conceptions we can poflibly\nform of this blifsful abode, are extremely inadequate and imperfect $ nor\nis it in the power of the moft enlarged underftanding to frame fuitable\nideas of the Godhead, or of the angelic hoft that perpetually furround his\nthrone. As much, however, as the human comprehenfion is able to con\u00ad\ntain, the Almighty has been gracioufly pleafed to reveal to us in the Scrip\u00ad\ntures, by the infpired writers, particularly Ifaiah, Ezekiel, and St. John\nthe Divine, who have given us very magnificent defcriptions of the hea\u00ad\nvenly manfions, their ftrutture, apparatus, and angelic attendance. From\nthis divine Revelation the Hebrew writers, and other learned men, have\ndeferibed the Harmony of the Univerfe, and the neceflary fubordination\nand dependence of one thing upon another, from the interior heaven to\nthe remoteft corner of the earth. We (hall therefore prefume to follow\nthefe authors in fpeaking of God and his angels j and whoever fufficiently\ncontemplates the fubject will be fecure againft the impious doctrines of\nAtheifts, of Free-thinkers, of immoral and irreligious men.\nGod is an immaterial, intelligent, and free. Being; of perfect good-\nnefs, wifdom, and power; who made the univerfe, and continues to fup-\nport it, as well as to govern and direct it by his providence. By his im*\nmateriality, intelligence, and freedom, God is diftinguilhed, from fate,\nnature, deftiny, neceflity, chance, and from all other imaginary beings.\nIn feripture, God is defined by, I am that I am ; Alpha and Omega; the\nbeginning and end of all things. Among philofophers, he is defined a\nBeing of infinite perfection ; or in whom there is no defect of any thing\nwhich we conceive might raife, improve, or exalt, his nature. Among\nmen, he is chiefly confniered as the firft caufe, the firft Being, who has\nexifted from the beginning, has created the world, or who fubfifts\nneceflarily, or of himfelf; and this knowledge of God, his nature,\nattributes, word, and works, with the relations between him and\nhis creatures, make the extenffve fubjedt of Theology, the lifter\nfcience of Aftrology.\nNo. 4. O Sir\nOriginal from\nw m \/ i \/ v n o i f ' di i d i i r 1 i d\nDigitized by ( j O G ^ l C\n\f7 a A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nSir Ifaac Newton confiders and defines God, not as is ufually done, from\nhis perfe&ion, his nature, exiftence, or the like; but from his dominion.\nThe word God, according to him, is a relative term, and has a regard to\nfervants; it is true it denotes a Being eternal, infinite, and abfolutely per-\nfe\u00a3l; but a Being, however eternal, infinite, and abfolutely perfect, with\u00ad\nout dominion, would not be God. The fame author obferves, that the\nword God frequently fignifies Lord; but every lord is not God; it is the\ndominion of a fpiritual being, or lord, that eonftitutes God; true domi\u00ad\nnion, true God; fupreme, the fupreme; feigned, the falfe god. From\nfuch true dominion it follows, that the true God is living, intelligent,\nand powerful; and from his other perfections, that he is fupreme, or\nfupremely perfect: he is eternal, and infinite; omnipotent, and omnifci-\ncnt; that is, he endures from eternity to eternity, and is prefent from\ninfinity to infinity. He governs all things that exift, and knows all things\nthat are to be known; he is not eternity, nor infinity, but eternal, and\ninfinite; he is not duration or fpace, but he endures, and is prefent; he\nendures always, and is prefent every where; and, by exifting always, and\nevery where, he eonftitutes the very thing, duration and fpace, eternity\nand infinity. He is omniprefent, not only virtually, but alfo fiibftanti-\nally; for power without fubftance cannot fubfift. All things are contain\u00ad\ned, and move in him, but without any mutual paflion; he fuffers nothing\nfrom the motions of bodies; nor do they undergo any refiftance from his\n\u00a9mniprefcnce. It is confefled that God exifts neceftarily ; and by the\nfame neceflity he exifts always, and every where. Hence, alfo, he muft\nbe perfeClly fimilar ; all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm, all the power of\nperceiving, underftanding, and aCting ; but after a manner not at all cor\u00ad\nporeal, after a manner not like that of men, after a manner wholly to us\nunknown. He is deftitute of all body, and all bodily ihape; and there\u00ad\nfore cannot be feen, heard, or touched; nor ought to be worfhipped un\u00ad\nder the reprefentation of any thing corporeal. We have ideas of the at\u00ad\ntributes of God, but do not know the fubftance even of any thing; we\nfee only the figures and colours of bodies, hear only founds, touch only\nthe outward furfaces, fmell only odours, and tafte taftes; but do not, can\u00ad\nnot, by any fenfe, or any reflex adt, know their inward fubftances; and\nmuch lefs can we have any notion of the fubftance of God. We know\nhim by his properties and attributes; by the moft wife and excellent\nftruCture of things, and by final caufes; but we adore and worihip him\nonly on account of his dominion ; for God, fetting afide dominion, pro\u00ad\nvidence, and final caufes, is nothing elfe but fate and * nature.\nThe admirable metaphyfician and divine. Dr. Clarke, has demonftrated\nthe being of a God, with that clearnefs and force of reafoning for whichr\n* See Newton\u2019s Phtlof. N at. Princip.

Something, he fays, has\nexifted from all eternity; for, fince fomething now is, fomething always\nwas: otherwife the things that now are mull have been produced out of\nnothing, abfolutely and without caufe, which is a plain contradiction in\nterms. There muft have exifted from all eternity fome one unchangeable\nand independent Being; or elfe, there has been an infinite fucceffion of\nchangeable and dependent beings, produced one from another in an endlefs\nprogrcffion, without any original caufe at all. For without, this feries of\nbeings can have no caufe of its exiftence, becaufe it includes all things that*\nare or ever were in the univerfe; nor is any one being in this infinite luc-*-\nceffion felf-exiftent or neceflary, and therefore it can have no rcafon of its-\nexiftence within itfelf; and it was equally poffible, that from eternity*\nthere fhould never have exifted any thing at all, as that a fucceffion of fuch^\nbeings fhould have exifted from eternity. Confequently their exiftence\nis determined by nothing; neither by any neceffity in their own nature,\nbecaufe none of them are felf-exiftent; nor by any other being, becaufe\nno other is fuppofed to exift.\u2014That unchangeable and independent Being,-\nwhich has exifted from eternity, without any external caufe of its exift\u00ad\nence, muft be felf-exiftent; it muft exift by an abfolute neceffity origi\u2014\n-\nnally in the nature of the thing itfelf, and antecedent in the natural order'\nof our ideas to our fuppofition of its being. For whatever exifts,. muft\ncither come into being without a caufe; or it muft have been produced\nby fbme external caufe; or it muft be felf-exiftent: but the two former\nfuppofitions are contrary to the two firft propofitions. From this laft'\npropofition it follows, that the only true idea of a felf-exiftent or necef-\nfarily exifting being, is the idea of a being, the fuppofition of whole non-\nexiftence is an exprefs contradiction ; and this idea is that of a moft limplc\nbeing, abfolutely eternal and infinite, original and independent. It fol\u00ad\nlows alfo, that nothing is fo certain as the exiftence of a fupreme inde--\npendent c*ufe; and likewife, that the material world cannot poffibly be\nthe firft and original being, uncreated, independent, and of itfelf eternal;,\nbecaufe it does not exift by an abfolute neceffity in its own nature,.fo as\nthat it muft be an exprefs contradiction to fuppofe it not to exift. W ith\nrefpeCt both to its form and matter, the material world may be conceived-\nnot to be, or to be in any refpeCl different from what it is without a con\u00ad\ntradiction. The fubftance or effence of the felf-exiftent being is abfo\u00ad\nlutely incomprchenfible by us; neverthelefs, many of the effential attri\u00ad\nbutes of his nature are ftriCtly demonftrable, as well as his exiftence.\u2014\nThe felf-exiftent being, having no caufe of its exiftence but the abfoluta\nneceffity of its own nature, muft of neceffity have exifted from everlaft-\ning, without beginning ; and muft of neceffity exift to everlafting, without\nend.\u2014The felf-exillent being muft of neceffity be infinite and omnipre-\nfent.\nOriginal from\nM P \/ l f Dl ID I Ir I I D D A D V\nDigitized by C j O O Q I C\n\f\u25a0n A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nXent. Such a being muft be every where, as well as always unalterably'\nthe fame. It follows from hence, that the felf-exiftent being muft be a\nmoftfimple, unchangeable, incorruptible, being, without parts, figure,\nmotion, divifibility, and other properties of matter, which are utterly in-\n\u2022confiftent with complete infinity. The felf-exiftent being muft of necef-~\nfity be but one; becaufe in abfolute neceflity there can be no difference\nor diverfity of exiftence; and, therefore, it is abfolutely impofilble, that\nthere fhould be two independent felf-exiftent principles, fuch as God and\nmatter.\u2014The felf-exiftent and original caufe of all things muft be an in-\n_ , ielligent being. This propofition cannot be demonftrated ftridtly and\nproperly.*\n? priori; but, a pofieriori, the world affords undeniable argu-\nments to prove that all thmgs'are^the effefts of an intelligent and know-\n* iog caufe. The caufe muft be always more excellent than the effedt; and,\ntherefore, from the various kinds of powers and degrees of excellence and\nperfection, which vifible objedts poflcfs j from the intelligence of created\nbeings, which is a real diftindt quality or perfection, and not a mere ef\u00ad\nfect or oompofition of unintelligent figure and motion ; from the variety,\norder, beauty, wonderful contrivance, and fitnefs, of all things to their\nproper and refpedtive ends; and from the\u2019original of motion, the felf-\nexiftent creating being is demonftrated to be intelligent. The felf-exift-\nent and original caufe of all things is not a neceffary agent, but a bdng en\u00ad\ndued with liberty and choice. Liberty is a neceffary confequent of intel\u00ad\nligence.; without liberty, no being can be faid to bean agent, or caufe of\nanything; fince to a61 neceflarily, is really and properly not to adt at all,\nbut to be adted upon. Befides, if the fupreme caufe be not endued with\nliberty, it will follow, that nothing which is not could poflibly have\nbeen ; that nothing which is,.could poflibly not have been; and that no\nmode or circumftance of the exiftence of any thing could poflibly have\nbeen in any refpedl otherwife than what it now actually is. Farther, if\nthere be any final caufe i# the univerfe, the fupreme caufe is a free agent;\nand, on the contrary fuppofition, it is impoflible that any effedt fhould be\nfinite; and in every effedt there muft have been a progreflion a# caufes\ninfinitum, without any original oaufe at all.\u2014The felf-exiftent being, the\nfupreme caufe of all things, muft of neceflity have infinite power; fince all\nthings were made by him, and are entirely dependent upon him ; and all\nthe powers of all things are derived from him, and perfedlly fubjedt to\nhim ; nothing can refill the execution of his will.\u2014 The fupreme caufe\nand author of all things muft of neceflity be infinitely wife. This fol\u00ad\nlows from the propofitions already eftablifhed; and the proof a \u2019\n,\ncf the infinite wifdom of God, from the confideration of the exquifite\nperfection and confummate excellency of his works, i6 no lefs ftrong and\nundeniable.\u2014The fupreme caufe and author of all things muft of necef\u00ad\nfity be a being of infinite goodnefs, juftice, and truth, and all other moral\nperfections; fuch as become the fupreme governor and judge of the\nworld.\nOriginal from\nm c u \/ v n o b ' D i i m i r i i b b a b v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y 75\nworld. The will of a being, infinitely knowing and wife, independent and\nall-powerful, can never be influenced by any wrong affection, and can ne\u00ad\nver be milled or oppofed from without ; and, therefore, he muft do al\u00ad\nways what we know fitted to be done ; that is, he muft aCt always ac\u00ad\ncording to the ftriCteft rules of infinite goodnefs, juftice, and truth, and\nall other moral perfections ; and more particularly, being infinitely and\nncceffarily happy and all-fufficient, he muft be unalterably difpofed to do\nand to communicate good or *happinefs.\nTo this more abftrufe argument a priori, for theexiftence of God, we\nmay add another, more generally obvious, and carrying irrefiftible con\u00ad\nviction, which is deduced from the frame of the world, and from the\ntraces of evident contrivance and fitnefs of things for one another that\noccur through all the parts of it. Thefe confpire to prove, that the ma\u00ad\nterial world, which in its nature is originated and dependent, could not\nhave been the effeCt of chance or neceflity, but of intelligence and defign.\nThe beautiful, harmonious, and beneficial, arrangement of the various bo\u00ad\ndies that compofe the material fyftem; their mutual dependence and fub-\nferviency ; the regularity of their motions, and the aptitude of thefe mo\u00ad\ntions for producing the moft beneficial effects ; and many other pheno\u00ad\nmena refultingfrom their relation, magnitude, fituatton, and ufe, afford\nunqueftionable evidences of the creating power and wife difpofal of an in\u00ad\ntelligent and almighty agent. The power of gravity, by which the ce-\nleftial bodies perfevere in their revolutions, deferves our particular confi-\nderation. This power penetrates to the centres of the fun and planets,\nwithout any diminution of its virtue, and is extended to immenfe dif-\ntances, regularly decreafing, and producing the moft fenfible and impor\u00ad\ntant effeCts. Its action is proportional to the quantity of folid matter in\nbodies, and not to their furfaces, as is ufual in\u00bbmechanical caufes ; and,\ntherefore, feems to furpafs mere mechanifm. But however various the\nphenomeiyi that depend on this power, and may be explained by it, no\nmechanical principles can account for its effects; much lefs could it have\nproduced, at the beginning, the regular fituation of the orbs, and the pre-\nfent difpofition of things. Gravity could not have\"determined the planets\nto move from weft to eaft, in orbits nearly circular, almoft in the fame\nplane; nor could their power have projected tw| comets, with all the va\u00ad\nriety of their directions.

The fame powers, therefore, which at prefent govern the\nmaterial world, and condud: its various motions, are very different from\nthofe, which were neceffary to have produced it from nothing, or to have\ndifpofed it in the admirable form in which it now proceeds.\nBut we Should exceed the limits of our plan, if, confining our observa\u00ad\ntion to the earth, our own habitation, we were to enumerate only the\nprincipal traces of defign and wifdom, as well as goodnefs, which are dis\u00ad\ncernible in its figure and conftituent parts, in its diurnal and annual mo\u00ad\ntion, in the pofition of its axis with regard to its orbit, in the benefit\nwhich it derives from the light and heat of the fun, and the alternate vi-\nciflitudes of the feafons; in the atmofphere which Surrounds it, and in\nthe different Species and varieties of vegetables and animals with which\nit is replenifhed. No one can Survey the vegetable produftions of the\nearth, io various, beautiful, and ufeful, nor the various gradations of ani\u00ad\nmal life, in Such a variety of Species, all preServed diftind, and propa\u00ad\ngated by a fettled law, each fitted to its own element, provided with pro\u00ad\nper food, and with inftinds and organs Suited to its rank and Situation,\nand especially with the powers of fenfation and Self-motion, and all more\nimmediately or remotely fubfervient to the government and ufe of man,\nWithout admiring the Skill and defign of the original Former. But thefe\nare more Signally manifefted in the Strudure of the human frame, and in\nthe noble powers and capacities of the human mind ; more efpecially in\nthe moral principles and faculties, which are a diftinguifhing part of our\nconstitution, and lead to the perception and acknowledgement of the ex\u00ad\nistence and government of God. In thofe instances that have now been\nrecited, and a variety of Similar inftances Suggelted by them, or naturally\noccurring to the notice of the curious and refleding mind, contrivance is\nmanifest, and immediately, without any nice or Subtle reafoning, fuggefts\na contriver. It Strikes us like a fenfation; and artful reafonings againft\nit may puzzle us, without Shaking our belief. No perfon, for example,\nthat knows the principles of optics, and the Structure of the eye, can\nbelieve that it was formed without Skill in that Science; or that the ear\nwas formed without the knowledge of Sounds; or that the male and fe\u00ad\nmale, created and preferved in due proportion, were not formed for each\nother, and for continuing the Species. All our accounts of nature are full\nof inSlances of this kind. The admirable and beautiful Structure of\nthings for final caufes exalts our idea of the contriver; and the unity of\ndefign Shews him to be one.

'I he ufefulnefs of the whole fcheme, fo well con\u00ad\ntrived for the intelligent beings who enjoy it, with the internal difpofition\nand moral ftruCture of thofc beings, fhews his unbounded goodnefs.\n'1 hefe are arguments which are fufficiently open to the views and capa\u00ad\ncities of the unlearned, while at the fame time they acquire new ftrength\nand luftre from the dilcoveries of the learned. The Deity\u2019s acting and in-\nterpofing in the univerfe, fhew that he governs it, as well as that he form\u00ad\ned it and the depth of his counfels, even in conducting the material uni\u00ad\nverfe, of which a great part furpaffes our knowledge, tends to preferve an\ninward veneration and awe of this great Being, and difpofes us to receive\nwhat may be otherwife revealed to us concerning him. His eflence, as\nwell as that of all other fubftances, is beyond the reach of all our difco-\nveries j but his attributes clearly appear in his admirable works. We know\nthat the higheft conceptions we are able to form of them are ftill beneath\nhis real perfections j but his dominion over us, and our duty towards him,\nare abundantly * manifeft.\nAnother fubftantial argument to prove the exiftence of God, as the\ncreator and governor of the univerfe, may be deduced from the univerfal\nconfcnt of mankind, and the uniform tradition of this belief through\nevery nation and every age; it is impoffible to conceive, that a fallacy,\nfo perpetual and univerfal, ftiould be impofed on the united reafon of man\u00ad\nkind. No credible and fatisfaCtory account can be given of this univerfal\nconfent, without afcribing it to the original conftitution of the human\nmind, in confiquence of which it cannot fail to difcern the exiftence of a\nDeity, and to the undeniable traces of his being, which his works afford.\nFear, ftate-policy, and the prejudices of education, to which the concur\u00ad\nrence of mankind in this principle has been fometimes refolved, are founded\non this univerfal principle, fuppofe its being an influence, and are actuated\nby it. It is much more reafonable to imagine, that the belief of a God\nwas antecedent to their operation, than that itfhould have been produced\nby them; and that it was dictated by reafon and confcience, independent\nof the paflion and policy of men. The uniform and univerfal tradition\nof this belief, and of the creation of the world by the divine power, af\u00ad\nfords concurring evidence both of the principle and of the tad. 1he\nexiftenceof God is alio farther evinced by thofe arguments whichhave been\nufually alledged to prove, that the world had a beginning, and, therefore,\n* See M aclaurin\u2019s A ccount o f Sir Ifaac N ew to n \u2019s Phil.

In proof\nof this, the hiftory of Mofes, confidered merely as themoft ancient hifto-\nrian, deferves particular regard. His teftimony is confirmed by the moll\nancient writers, among the heathens, both poets and hiftorians. It may\nbe alio fairly alledged, that we have no hiftory or tradition more ancient\nthan that which agrees with the received opinion of the world\u2019s begin\u00ad\nning, and of the manner in which it was produced ; and that the mod\nanpient hiftories were written long after that time. And this confidera-\ntion is urged by Lucretius, the famous Epicurean, as a ftrong prefump-\ntion that the world had a beginning: -\n------Si nulla fuit genitalis origo\nTerrarum & cceli, lemperque seterna fuere:\nCur fupra bellum Thebanum, & funera Trojae,\nNon alias alii quoque res cecinere poetae?\nBefides, the origin and progrefs of learning, and the moft ufeful arts,\nconfirm the notion of the world\u2019s beginning, and of the common asra of\nits creation ; to which alfo may be added, that the world itfelf, being\nmaterial and corruptible, mud have had a beginning; and many pheno\u00ad\nmena occur to the obfervation of the aftronomer and mathematician,\nwhich furnilh a ftrong prefumption, that it could have had no long du\u00ad\nration, and that it now gradually tends to diftolution. From thefe con-\nfiderations we may infer the abfolute being and providence of God ;\nwhich alfo demonftrate the exiftence of his angels and miniftring fpirits,\nwho are the meflengers of his will, and the proper inhabitants of the\nethereal world, ahd confequently the next fubje&s of our enquiry.\nAn Angel is a fpiritual intelligent fubftance, and the firft in rank and\ndignity of all created beings j though the word Angel, Ayyo.o(, is not pro\u00ad\nperly a denomination of nature, but of office; denoting a mejfenger, or\nexecutioner of the will of fome fuperior power or authority. In this fenfe\nthey are frequently mentioned in Scripture, as miniftring fpirits fent by\nthe Almighty to declare his will, and to corredl, teach, reprove, and com\u00ad\nfort. God alfo promulgated the law to Mofes, and appeared to the old\npatriarchs by the mediation of angels, who reprefented him, and fpoke\nin his name. The exiftence of angels is admitted in all religions ; the\nGreeks and Latins acknowledged them under the names of genii and\ndemons ; and in the Alcoran we find frequent mention of them j the\nprofeflors of the Mahometan religion affigned them various orders and\ndegrees, as well as different employments, both in heaven and on earth.\nThe Sadducees alfo admit their exiftence: witnefs Abufaid, the author of\nan Arabic verfion of the Pentateuch; and Aaron, a Caraite Jew, in his\ncomment on the Pentateuch ; both extant in manufcript in the king of\nFrance\u2019s library. The heathen philofophers and poets were alfo agreed as\nto the exiftence of intelligent beings, fuperior to man ; as is (hewn by\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM C I A \/ v n o ^ Dl m i I f\" I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 79\nSt. Cyprian, in his treatifc on the vanity of idols, from the teftimonies\nof Plato, Socrates, and Trifmegiftus. Authors are not fo unanimous\nabout their nature as of their exiftence; Clemens Alexandrinus believed\nthey had bodies, which was alfo the opinion of Origen, Caefarius, Ter-\ntullian, and feveral others; but Athanafius, Bafil, Gregory, Nicene,\nCyril, and Chryfoftom, hold them to be mere fpirits. Authors\nare alfo divided as to the time of the creation of angels; fome will have\nit to have been before the creation of our world, or ever from eternity ;\nwhile others maintain that they were created at the fame time with our\nworld. The moft probable conje&ure is, that they were created at dif\u00ad\nferent periods, whenever it pleafcd the Almighty to call them into ex\u00ad\niftence. But, though we cannot fo clearly demonftrate the precife nature\nand duration of angels, we may neverthelefs conclude, that, though they\nare of an order highly fuperior to that of men, yet are they not complete\nand perfeft; for, had they been created thus originally, they could not\nhave fallen, as Adam did, nor have finned, which the feriptures inform\nus fome of them did, by rebelling againft the Almighty, and in contend\u00ad\ning with him for fupreme authority. For this reafon, as they are them-\nfelves imperfett beings, they can in no one refpedl be confidered proper\nobjects of human adoration, which we are bound to pay alone to that\nO ne Supreme, who is omnipotent, immortal, infinite, the fource and\ncentre of every thing that is great, and good, and perfect.\nTheologifts have divided angels into different ranks or fubordinations,\nwhich they term Hierarchies, from \u201ef0{, holy, and , fignifying,\nholy c\no\nm\nm\na\nn\nd\n, or to rule in holy things. Dionyfius and other ancient\nwriters have eftablifhed nine choirs or orders of thefe celeftial fpirits,\nnamely, feraphim, cherubim, thrones, dominions, principalities, powers,\nvirtues, angels, and archangels; and thefe they form into three Hierarchies,\nappointing them their refpe&ive offices in the performance of adoration\nand praife, and in executing the word and will of God. The Rabbins\nand Jewifh writers, who had obvioufly a more immediate knowledge of\nthe angelic hoft, by the infpiration of their prophets, and the revelation\nof God\u2019s true religion, have defined one rank of angels, or intelligent\nbeings, fuperior to all the foregoing, which anfwer to or are contained in\nthe ten diftinguifhing names of God, and are the pure offences of his\nfpirit, or ftream though which his will and pleafure is communicated\nto the angels and blefied fpirits, and through which his providence extends\nto the care and prote&ion of all his works. The firft of thefe divine ef-\nfences is denominated riVT, \"Jehovah,\nand is peculiarly attribute\nthe Father, being the pure and fimple effence of the Divinity, flowing\nthrough Hajoth Hakados to the angel Metratton, and to the miniftering\nfpirit Refchith Hagalalim, who guides th and beftows\nthe gift of being upon all things.

Ih e third is and is attributed to the\nHoly Spirit, whofe divine light is received by the angel Sabbathi, and\ncommunicated from him through the fphere of Saturn. This is\ncipium generations, the beginning of the ways of God, or the manifefta-\ntion of the Father and the Son\u2019s light in the fupernatural generation.\nAnd from hence flow down all living fouls, entering the inanimate body,\nand giving form to unfettled matter.

The fifth is ViV#, Elohi, the upholder of the fword\nfind left-hand of God, whofe influence penetrates the angel Geburah, and\nthence defcends though the fphere of Mars, giving fortitude in war and\naffliction. The fixth is JTiiQ\u00a5, Tfebaotb, who beftoweth his mighty\npower through the angel Raphael into the fphere of the Sun, giving rao-\nv tion, heat, and brightnefs, to it, and thence producing metals. The fe-\nventh is Elion, who rules the angel Michael, and defcends though\nthe fphere of Mercury, giving benignity, motion, and intelligence, with\nelegance and confonance of fpeech. The eighth is W it, whole\ninfluence is received by the angel Haniel, and communicated through the\nfphere of Venus, giving zeal, fervency, and righteounefs of heart, and\nproducing vegetables. The ninth is Tttf, Shaddai, whofe influence is con\u00ad\nveyed by cherubim to the angel Gabriel, and falls into the fphere of the\nMoon, cauling increafe and decreafe of all things, governing the genii and\nproteClors of men. The tenth is O H 1\n?#, Elobim, who extends his bene\u00ad\nficence to the angel Jefodoth, into the fphere of the earth, and difpenfeth\nknowledge, underHanding, and wifdom. The three firft of thefe ten\nnames, viz. ftlPP, Jehovah, IT, Jah, and riVTK, Ehjeh, exprefs the\nelfence of God, and are proper names $ but the other feven are only ex-\npreflive of bis,.attributes. The principal and only true name of the God\u00ad\nhead, according both to the Hebrews and and Greeks, is\nthe name o ffour letters, with which the Godhead, in molt\nlanguages, is obferved to be exprefied; thus in Hebrew the Supreme\nBeing\nDigitized by Go*, sle Original from\nM C I A \/ D I I D I I r I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . Hi\nBeing is called ri'T Jehovah; in the Greek, \u00a9\n\u00ab>\n<\n; in Latin, it\nSpanifh, D\ni\no\ns; in Italian, I\nd\ni\no;in French, in the ancient G\nilii, D iex;\nin ancient German, D\ni\ne\nt; in the Sclavonic, Buck-, in Arabic,\nAlia-, in the Polifli, Bung-, in the Pannonian, in the Egyptian,\nHenu-, in the Perlian, S\nj\nr\ne;and in the language of the ancient Magi,\nOrji. Thus God is conceived to work by the ideas of his own mind,\nand thefe ideas difpenfe their feals, and communicate them to whatever\nis formed or created.\nIn the exterior circle of the celeftial heaven, in which are placed\nthe fixed ftars, the AnimaMundi hath her particular forms, or feminal\nconceptions, anfwering to the ideas of the Divine Mind ; and this fitu-\nation, approaching neareft to the empyrean heaven, the feat of God, re\u00ad\nceives the fpiritual powers and influences which immediately proceed\nfrom him. Hence they are diffufed through the fpheres of the planets\nand heavenly bodies, and communicated to the inmoft centre of the earth,\nby means of the terreftrial elements. Thus have the wife and learned\nmen among the Jews deduced the conftrudion and harmony of the world,\nand flicwn that God performs all his fecret and ftupendous works by the\nmedium of the celeftial bodies. He ads and governs immediately by\nhimfelf, but mediately by the heavenly bodies, which are the inftruments\nof his Providence, and the fecondary caufes, by which the earth and all\nfimilar fyftems are regulated; and thefe, perhaps, regulate one another,\nby a reciprocal influence and fympathy, communicated to them in the\nordination of nature. And hence comes the original or ground-work\nof all men\u2019s nativities, and all manner of natural queftions and things,\nand the ftory of all that may happen or proceed out of natural caufes, to\nthe full end of time. To demonftrate this more fatisfadorily, we fhall\nnow define the natural properties of the celeftial world, with its particu\u00ad\nlar divifions, quantity, motion, and meafure, as laid down by the rules\nof Aftronomy; and this will lead us to the dodrine of nativities.\nAN\nDigitized by ( j O O Q I C\nOriginal from\nM DA f V A D L' n i m i Ir I IDE? A D V\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nAN ASTRONOM ICAL SURVEY of the CELESTIA L W O R LD ;\nwith the Places, Order, and Motions, of the H eavenly Bodies.\nI\nT was formerly a fubjedt of difpute among Philofophers, whether the\nearth or the Sun was the centre of the celeftial fyftem ; but the latter\nopinion has been generally received fincethe time of Copernicus, whoabout\nthe year 1543 published his fix books De Orbium Coeleftium Revolu-\ntionibus, wherein he proves the Sun to be very near the centre of gravity of\nthe whole fyftem, and in the common focus of every one of the planetary\norbits. Next the Sun, Mercury performs his revolution around him ;\nnext to Mercury is the orbit of Venus ; and next to Venus, our earth,\nwith its attendant or fecondary the Moon, perform ajoint courfe, and by\ntheir revolution meafure out the annual period. Next to the earth is\nMars, the firft of the fuperior planets: next to him is Jupiter j and, laft\nof all, Saturn. Thefe and the comets are the conftituent parts of the\nCopernican or folar fyftem, which is now received and approved as the\nonly true one, becaufe mod agreeable to the tenor of nature in all her ac\u00ad\ntions; for, by the two motions of the earth all the phenomena of the\nheavens are rcfolved, which by other hypothefes arc inexplicable without\na great number of other motions contrary to philofophical reafoning. It\nis alfo more rational to fuppofe that the earth moves round the Sun, than\nthat the huge bodies of the planets, the ftupendous body of the Sun, and\nthe immenfe firmament of fiars, fliould all move round the earth every\ntwenty-four hours. The harmony which runs through the folar fyftem\nwonderfully confirms this hypothefis, viz. that the motions of all the\nplanets, both primary and fecondary, are governed and regulated by one\nand the fame law, which is, that the fquares of the periodical times of\nthe primary planets arc to each other as the cubes of their diftances from\nthe Sun; and likewife the fquares of the periodical times of the feconda-\nries of any primary are to each other as the cubes of their diftances from\nthat primary. Now the Moon, which, in the Copernican fyftem, is a fe\u00ad\ncondary of jhe earth, in the other hypothefis is confidered as a primary\none; and fo the rule cannot take place, becaufe the periodical time ftated\nas that of a primary one does not agree therewith. But this fingle confi-\nderation is fufficient to eftablifh the motion of the earth for ever! viz. if\nthe earth does not move round the Sun, the Sun mull move with the\nMoon round the earth. Now, the diftance of the Sun to that of the\nMoon being as 10,000 to 46, and the Moon\u2019speriod being lefs thantwen-\nty-eight days, the Sun\u2019s period would be found no lefs than two hundre,\nand forty-two years; whereas, in fadt, it is but one year. The Sun alio\nbeing the fountain of light and heat, which it irradiates through all the\n1 fyftem\nDigitized by Google Original from\nmcwu vncfc' di id 1 i r i i d d a d v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 83\nfyftem, it mud of courfe be placed in the centre, in order that the planets\nmay at all times have it in an uniform and equable manner. For, if the\nearth be fuppofed in the centre, and the Sun and planets revolve about it,\nthe planets would then, like the comets, be fcorched with heat when\nneareft the Sun, and frozen with cold in their aphelia, or greateft diftance;\nwhich is not to be imagined. But, if the Sun be fuppofed in the centre\nof the fyftem, we then have the rational hypothefisof the planets being all\nmoved round the Sun, by the univerfal law or power of gravity arifing\nfrom his vaft body, and every thing will anfwer to the laws of circular\nmotion and central forces; but otherwife we are wholly in the dark, and\nknow not how to define thefe operations of nature. Fortunately, however,\nwe are able to give not only reafons, but dcmonftrable proofs, that the Sun\ndoes poffefs the centre of the fyftem, and that the planets move about\nhim in the order above-mentioned. The firft is, that Mercury and Ve\u00ad\nnus are ever obferved to have two conjunctions with the Sun, but no op-\npofition, which could not happen unlefs the orbits of thefe planets lay\nwithin the orbit of the earth. The i'econd is, that Mars, Jupiter, and\nSaturn, have each their conjunctions and oppofitions to the Sun alternately\nand fuccefiively, which could not be unlefs their orbits were exterior to\nthat of the earth. In the third place, the greateft elongation or diftance\nof Mercury from the Sun is about twenty degrees, and that of Venus\nforty-feven degrees ; which anfwers exaClly to their diftance in this fyf\u00ad\ntem ; but, in the other, they would be leen one hundred and eighty de\u00ad\ngrees from the Sun, in oppofition to him. Fourthly, in this difpofition\nof the planets, they will all of them be fometimes much nearer to the earth\nthan at others; the confequence of which is, that their brightnefs and\nfplendour, and alfo their apparent diameters, will be proportionally great\u00ad\ner at one time than another; and this we obferve to be true every day.\nTh us, the apparent diameter of Venus, when greateft, is near fixty-fix\nfeconds, but, when leaft, not more than nine and a half; of Mars, when\ngreateft, it is twenty-one feconds, but, when leaft, no more than two fe\u00ad\nconds and a half; whereas, by the other hypothecs, they ought always\nto be equal. The fifth is, that, when the planets are viewed with a goocf\ntelelcope, they appear with different phafes, or with different parts of\ntheir bodies enlightened. Thus Venus is fometimes new, then horned,\nand afterwards dichotomized, then gibbous, afterwards full, and fo en-\ncreafes and decreafes her light in the fame manner as the Moon, and as\nthis fyftem requires. Thefixth proof is, that the planets, all of them,\ndo fometimes appear direct in motion, fometimes retrograde, and at other\ntimes ftationary. Thus, Venus, as fhe paffes from her greateft elongation\nweftward to her greateft elongation eaftward, will appear direCt in mo\u00ad\ntion, but retrograde as fhe paffes from the latter to the former; and,\nwhen (he is in thofe points of greateft diftance from the Sun, fhe feems\nNo. 4. R for\nDigitized by Go*, sle Original from\nv n o h ' DI IP I i r I I R R A B V\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n84\nfor fome time ftationary; all which is neceftary upon the Copernican hy-\npothefis, but cannot happen in any other. The l'eventh is, that the bo\u00ad\ndies of Mercury and Venus, in their low conjunctions with the Sun, are\nhid behind the Sun\u2019s body, and in the upper coniundions are feen to\npafs over the Sun\u2019s body, or difk, in form of a black round l'pot, which is\nneceftary in the Copernican fyftem, but impoflible in any other. The\neighth is, that the times in which thefe conjundions, oppofitions, fta-\ntions, and retrogradations, of the planets happen are not fuch as they\nwould be if the earth were at reft in its orbit, but precifely fuch as\nwould happen were the earth to move round the Sun, and all the other\nplanets in the periods afligned them ; and therefore this, and no other,\ncan be the true fyftem of the world.\nBut, the better to determine the pi sees of the celeftial bodies, and to\nunderftand the conftitution of the heavens more clearly, aftronomers have\nconceived or deferibed feveral circles, called the circles of the fphere, by\nwhich the celeftial world is divided and meafured out. Some of thefe\nare called great circles, as the equinoctial, ecliptic, meridian, &c. and\nothers fmall circles, as the tropics, parallels, &c. The equinoctial line\nis a circle which we imagine to inveft the whole world, and is fo called,\nbecaufe, whenever the Sun, in his progrefs through the ecliptic, comes to\nthis circle, it makes equal days and nights all round the globe, as he\nthen rifes due eaft, and fets due weft, which he never does at any other\ntime of the year. This equinoctial line is conceived to be three hundred\nand lixty degrees in its whole circumference; and each of thefe degrees\nis divided into lixty minutes, or fixty equal parts of a degree, and thefe\nagain into as many l'econds. The meridian is another great circle, con\u00ad\nfiding alfo of three hundred and fixty degrees, extending from one polar\npoint to the other, and twice cutting the equinodfial line, compafling the\nwhole world from north to fouth, as the equinoctial does from eaft to\nweft, and terminates at the fame point where it began. The equinoctial\nline is fixed and immutable, and is of neceflity always conceived to be\nin one and the fame place; but the meridian is mutable, and may circle\nthe world in any or in all degrees of the equator, as we may have occafion\nto conceive or imagine ; it muft, however, uniformly divide the fphere\ninto two equal parts, which are called hemifpheres. The polar points\nare thofe two points in the immenfe ball of the world which are equi-\ndiftant from the equinodiial line,, the one in the utmoft northern, and the\nother in the utmoft fouthern, point. The three hundred and lixty degrees\nof the equinoctial line are called the longitude of the world, becaufe they\nare in order as the Sun and ftars move in their circuits through the fpaci-\nous heavens in their refpeCfive orbs.

This tradition is\nfound in two ancient authors, the one Roman, the other Greek. The\nfirft attributes it to the Egyptians ; the other, to the firft inhabitants of\nChaldea. They every day faw the Sun and the whole heavens turning\nand pafling from eaft to weft. In the mean time they obferved that the\nSun, by a mttion peculiar to it, from day to day receded from fome cer\u00ad\ntain ftars, and took its place under others, always advancing towards the\neaft. Whilft the Moon was making twelve times that revolution, the\nSun made it only once ; but (he began the thirteenth again before the\nSun had as yet completed its own. The habit of dividing the year into\npretty near twelve lunations made them wilh that they had twelve divi-\nfions of a year perfectly equal, or twelve months, which might be exa&Iy\nequivalent to the year itfelf, and which might, as it were, be pointed at\nwith one\u2019s finger in the heavens, by (hewing fome certain ftars under which\nthe Sun pafles during every one of thefe months. Here is then the me\u00ad\nthod in which they divided the courfeof the Sun in twelve equal portions\nor cohesions of ftars, which are called afterifms or conftellations. Our\naftronomers took a couple of brafs open veffels, the one pierced at the\nbottom, and the other without any orifice below. Having flopped the\nhole of the firft, they filled it with water, and placed it fo as that the wa\u00ad\nter might run out into the other veflel the moment*the cock fhould be\nopened. This done, they obferved in that part of the heaven where the\nSun has its annual courfe the rifing of a ftar remarkable either for its\nmagnitude or brightnefs j and, at the critical inftant it appeared on the\nhorizon, they began to let the water flow out of the upper veflel into the\nother during the reft of the night, and the whole following day, to the\nvery moment when the fame ftar, being come to the eaft again, began to\nappear anew on the horizon. The inftant it was again feen, they took\naway the under veflel, and threw the water that remained in the other\non the ground. The oblervers were thus fure of having one revolution\nof the whole heaven between the firft rifing of the ftar and its return.\nThe water, which had flowed during that time, might then afford them\na means of meafuring the duration of one whole revolution of the heaven,\nand of dividing that duration into feveral equal portions; fince, by dividing\nthat water itfelf into twelve equal parts, they were lure of having the re\u00ad\nvolution of a twelfth part of the heaven during the efflux of a twelfth\npart of the water; they then divided the water of the under veflel into\ntwelve parts perfectly equal, and prepared two other finall veflels capable\nof containing exaflly one of thofc portions, and no more.

Then they placed under the cock, ftill fhut,\none of the two fmall veflels, and another near it to fucceed the firft as\nfoon as it fliould be full.\nAll thefe preparations being feady, they, the next night, obferved that\npart of the heaven towards which they had for a long while remarked that\nthe Sun, the Moon, and the planets, took their courfes, and ftaid for the\nriling of the conftellation which is fince called Aries. The Greeks, per\u00ad\nhaps, gave that name to fome ftars different from thefe which went by it\nbefore the flood; but this enquiry is not neceflary at prefent. The in-\nftant Aries appeared, and they faw the firft ftar of it afeending, they let\nthe water run into the little meafure. As foon as it was full, they re*\nmoved it, and threw the water out. In the mean time they put the other\nempty meafure under the fall. They obferved exactly, and fo as to re\u00ad\nmember very well, all the ftars that rofe during all the periods which the\nmeafure took in filling; and that part of the heaven was terminated in\ntheir obfervations by the ftar which appeared the 1aft on the horizon the\nmoment the meafure was juft full: fo that, by giving the two little veflels\nthe time neceflary to be alternately filled to the brim three times each\nduring the night, they had, by that means, one half of the courfe of the\nfun in the heaven, that is, one half of the heaven itfclf; and that halF\nagain was divided into fix equal portions, of which they might fhew and\n* diftinguifh the beginning, the middle, and the end, by ftars, which. Frond\ntheir fize, number, or order, were rendered diftinguifhable. As to the\nOther half of the heaven, and the fix other conftellations which the furi\nruns over therein, they were forced to defer the obfervation of them to\nanother feafon. They waited till the fun, being placed in the middle of\nthe now known and obferved conftellations, fhould leave them at liberty\nto fee the other during the night.\nDoubtlefs, fome precautions were neceflary, not to miftake as to the\nfall of the water, which muft flow more flowly in proportion as its mafs\nis lefs high. However, after having, by this or fome fuch means, made\nthemfelvcs fure of the great annual courfe which the fun faithfully fol\u00ad\nlows in the heavens, and of the equality of the fpaces filled by the twelve\ncollections of ftars that limit that courfe, the obfervers thought of giving\nthem names. They in general called them the ftations or the houfes of\nthe fun, and afligned three of them to each feafon. They then gave\neach conftellation a peculiar name, whofe property did not only confift\nin making it known again to all nations, but in declaring, at the fame\ntime, the circumftance of the year (which was of concern to mankind)\nwhen the fun fhould arrive at that conftellation.\nNo 4.

The lambs come the firft, the calves follow them, and the\nkids fall the laft. By this means the lambs, grown vigorous and ftrong,\ntnay follow the ram to the fields, as the fine days come on. Soon after\nthe calves, and at laft the kids, venture abroad, and, by increaftng the\nflock, begin to augment the revenues of their mafter.\nOur ancient obfervers, feeing that there were during the fpring no\nproductions more ufeful than lambs, calves, and kids, gave the conftel-\nlations, under which the fun pafles during that feafon, the names of the\nthree animals which enrich mankind moft. The firft was named Aries,\nthe fecond Taurus, the third the two kids, Gemini, the better to cha\u00ad\nracterize the fecundity of goats, which more commonly bring forth two\nyoung ones than one, and an abundance of milk more than fufiicient to\nnourith them.\nThe bulk of mankind had already very often remarked, that there was\na point to which the fun raifed itfelf in its coming towards them, but\nwhich it never exceeded; and that it afterwards funk daily, in receding\nfrom them, for fix months together, till it arrived at another point a great\nway under the firft, but below which it never defeended. This retreat\nof the Sun, made very flowly, and always backward, gave the obfervers\nthe occafion of diftinguithing the ftars, which follow the two kids, or\nGemini, by the name, of the animal that walks backward, viz. the crab.\nWhen the fun pafles under the next conftellation, it makes our climate\nfeel fultry heats, but chiefly the climates where men were at that time\nall gathered together. When poets attribute to that conftellation the\nfiercenefs and raging of the lion, of which it bears the name, it is very\neaiy toguefs at what might determine that choice from the beginning.\nSoon after, the houfing of the hay and the corn is entirely over through\u00ad\nout the eaft ; there remain on the ground only a few ears fcattered here\nand there, which they caufed to be gleaned by the leaft neceflary hands ;\nthis work is left to the youngeft girls. How then could they reprefent\nthe conftellation, under which the fun fees no longer any crops on the\nground, better than by the name and figure of a young maid gleaning ?\nThe wings you fee her have in the fpheres are ornaments added of later\ndate, after the introduction of fables. The virgin, which follows the\nlion, is certainly no other than a gleaning girl, or, if you will, a reaper;\nand, left we (hould miftake her functions, the befides has in her hand a clut\u00ad\nter of ears; a very natural proof of the origin here attributed to her.\nOriginal from\nW E \\ A \/ V f i Dl I D I I r I I D D A D V\nDigitized by Goc.ole\n\fu\nu\nm\nc\ni\nm\n,\nu\nu\nu\ny\ni\ne\n-\nu\ni\ny\ni\nu\n^\ne\nu\n\/\nini|j.\/\/vvvvvv.i\ni\nd\nu\niiu\nubL.ui\ny\/cn.t.ebb_ubt:-ff-pu-yuuyifc;\nO F A S T R O L O G Y .\nThe perfed: equality of days and nights, which happens when the Sun\nquits the fign Virgo, caufed aftronomers to give the next fign the name of\nLibra, that is, of a balance. The'frequent difeafes which the Sun leaves\nbehind him, or caufes by his retiring, procured the next lign the name of\nScorpio; becaufe it is mifchievous, and drags after it a fting and venom.\nTowards the end of autumn, the fall of the leaf expofes wild hearts, leav\u00ad\ning them lefs covering: vintage and harvert are over ; the fields are free;\nand it is of ill confequence to fuffer the propagation of hearts at the ap\u00ad\nproach of winter. Every thing then invites us to hunt, and the fign, in\nwhich the Sun is at that time, has from thence obtained the name of\nSagittarius; that is, the archer, or huntfman. What is the proper and\ndiftindive charader of the wild goat, or Capricorn, of which the firft\nlign of winter has the name ? it is to look for its food, getting from the\nfoot of the mountains to the higheft fummit, and always climbing from\nrock to rock: the name of Capricorn was then fit to inform men of\nthe time when the Sun, having reached the loweft verge of its courfe, was\nready to begin to afeend again towards the higheft, and to continue to do\nfo for fix months together. This is quite the reverfe of the crab (Cancer);\nand the happy concurrence of the oppofite charaders of thefe two ani\u00ad\nmals is a proof of what dire6led the firft obfervers in the impofition of\nall thefe names. Aquaries and Pifces, without any difficulty, mark out\nthe rainy feafon, and the time of the year when filhes, fatter and nicer than\nin any other time, bring on again the profit and pleafure of fifhing. It\nmay be remarked, that, of the twelve conftellations, there are ten the\nnames of which are borrowed from feveral animals; which caufed aftro-\nnomers to give the annual circle, which they compofe, the name of Zo\u00ad\ndiac. It is a6 much as if you would fay, circle ofanimals.\nBy this very plain induftry, men acquired a new method of meafuring\ntime, and of regulating all their works. They already knew,, without\nany trouble or care, how to regulate the order of their feafts and common\nbufinefs, by infpedion only of the phafes of the Moon. From the know\u00ad\nledge of the Zodiac, they obtained an exabt knowledge of the year ; the\nconftellations became to them fo many very fignificant figns, which,,\nboth by their names and refpeflive fituations, informed them of the or\u00ad\nder of their harvefts, and of the cautions they were to take in order to\nbring them about, openly and daily Ihewing them how long they were to\nftay for them; the people were neither obliged to cart up the days, nor\nmark out the order of times, to regulate themfelves. Twelve words, ap\u00ad\nplied to twelve different parts of the heaven, which every night revolved\nbefore their eyes, were to them a part of knowledge no lefs convenient\nand advantageous than ealy to be acquired. When men, after the letting\nof the Sun, faw the ftars of the fign Aries afeend the oppofite horizon,\nand diftant from the Sun by one half of the heaven, they then knew that\nthe\nOriginal from\nMP\\A\/ V f i P k ^ Dl ID I Ir I I RR A R V\nDigitized by Got. ole\n\f9\u00a9 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe fun was under the fign Libra, which, being the feventh of the celef-\ntial figns, was diftant from the firft: by one whole half of the Zodiac.\u2014\nWhen at the approach of day they faw in the middle of the heaven, and\nat an equal diftance from eaft and weft, the fineft ftar of the fign Leo, they\neafily underftood that the fun, then ready to rife, was at the diftance of\nthree figns from Leo, and removed towards the eaft one quarter part of its\ncircle. Thus, without feeing the ftars which the fun drowned by his\nbrightnefs as he came under them, they faid, with a perfedt affurance, that\nthe fun is now in Scorpio ; two months hence we {hall have the fhorteft\nday. '1 hey could, on light of afingle conftellation, placed in the eaftern,\nor middle, or weftern, part of the heaven, immediately fay where the fun\nwas, how far the year was advanced, and what kind of work it was fit\nthey Ihould bufy themfelves about. After this manner Ihepherds and\nfarmers ftill regulate their works; and, if we at prefent are now ignorant\nof the ftars, if we are not able to determine the diftance between one\nconftellation {hewn us and the a&ual place of the fun, it is becaufe we\ncan read and write. The firft men perufed the heavens for want of writ\u00ad\ning ; and it is on account of the conveniency of writing that the gene\u00ad\nrality of men now difpenfe with looking among the ftars for the know\u00ad\nledge of the operations and order of the year. But writing itfelf, that\nfo ufeful invention, is one of the produdts of aftronomy; and it may be\neafily (hewn alfo, that the names given the twelve ccleftial figns gave birth\nto the invention both of painting and writing. The hiftory of the heavens\nftill promifes further novelty, and it will continue to inform us of the\nhelps for which we are indebted to the ftudy of nature.\nNow, merely to know and to underftand thofe divifions of the heavens\nis nothing more than fpeculative aftrology, commonly called Aftronomy;\nbut, to attain to the knowledge of Aftrology in general, we muft be con-\nverfirit in the affeSlionsand qualities of the heavenly matter, and of the pla\u00ad\nnets and fixed ltars. It is generally imagined that the fixed ftars are faft-\nened in the eighth orb of the celeftial heaven, and only move as that orb\ndoth, and uniformly together, about one minute\u2019s fpace in a whole year;\nbut reafon has not abfolutely determined this point, foas to leave it quite\nfotisfadtory, or incontrovertible. The fixed ftars are obferved to differ\nfrom the planets by their twinkling or fparkling ; whence philofophers\nhave conceived them to Ihine with their own innate light, the fame as the\nfun does. The number of ftars difcoverable in either hemifphere is\nnot above a thoufand. This at firft may appear incredible, becaufe they\nfeem to be without number; but the deception arifes from our looking\nconfufcdly upon them, without reducing them into any order*.

The nearer they are fituated to the ecliptic line, and\nthe zodiac, fo much the apter are they to operate in the common a<\u00a3ts\nof nature; and fo much the mpre eaiily allured into the opportunities\nof our acquaintance. Of the firft magnitude we have extraordinary in-\nftances of that ftar in Leo, called Cor Leonis, in twenty-five degrees of the\nfign, to be of the nature of Mars and Jupiter mixed together ; and is a\nftar greatly contributing to noble qualifications, and kingly favour. Fa\u00ad\nmous alfo is the knowledge of S\np\ni\nc\naa\nftar of Virgo by conftella-\ntion, but in thefign Libra : this ftar partakes both of the nature of Venus\nand Mars, and contributes greatly to ecclefiaftical preferments. After\nthefe are very well known the ftars called Aldebaron in Gemini, and\nA ntaret\nDigitized by G O U ^ l C\nOriginal from\nMCIA\/ Dl ID I Ir I ID D A D V\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n94\nAntares in Sagittary, both liars of the nature of Mars, provoking to\ncourage and magnanimity, but inclining to violence and cruelty. Of\nthe fecond magnitude are the South , and the Head of Pollux,\nboth liars of a furious and violent nature. Of the third magnitude, >\nthe Head of Medufa,orAlgol,is famous for its mifchievous inclinations ;\nand fo are the two AJfes, liars of the fourth magnitude. Of the fifth\nmagnitude are the Pleiades, liars of remarkable influence, and celebrated\nfor their fweet and benevolent nature. Stars of the fixth magnitude\nare very fmall ; yet, notwjthllanding this, they are not without their\noperations upon earthly things j as in the breall of the Crab, called\nPrcefepe, are feveral little liars which appear only like a white cloud,\nand yet the force of this conllellation has been often felt in the affairs\nof mankind. Thefe fixed liars alfo often prove their force in the change\nof weather, as they happen to rile, culminate, or fct, with the fun,\nmoon, and planets.\nBut the conllellations which form the twelve figns of the zodiac have\nobvioully the moll powerful and moll immediate operation upon man j\nand the reafon is, becaufe they form the pathway of the fun, moon, and\nplanets, in all their peregrinations, and thereby receive from them a\nmore forcible power and energy. And, as thefe.figns form a confiderablc\npart of the Science of Allrology, we lhall confider them under all their\nvarious qualities and affections, both with refpecl to their operations upon\nman\u2019s body and upon the four feafons of the year. Thefe figns are\nknown or dillinguilhed by the following charaders :\nAries as Cancer & Libra\n\u00ab Taurus SI Leo rn. Scorpio\nn Gemini *\n$\n.\nVirgo \/ Sagittarius\nVf Capricornus\n~ Aquaries\nx Pifees'*1\n*\nThey are placed in this order, and divided into fqpr equal parts, an-\nfwering to the four quarters of the year, becaufe the equator cuts and\ndivides the circle of the zodiac at the point beginning with Aries, and at\nthe oppofite point of Libra, dividing the whole into two equal parts,\nconfilling of fix northern and fix fouthern figns. But the reafon why\nthe fun\u2019s courfe begins and is reckoned from Aries is, as tradition in\u00ad\nforms us, becaufe the fun, when firll brought into exiltence, was\nplaced in this fign. And this is not an unreafonable conje&ure, fince\nthe fpring quarter begins when the Sun enters Aries, and brings with\nit increase and length of days, and all nature begins to multiply and\nflourilh, and, as it were, to rife into new life. The fix northern figns\nterminate with Virgo, and the fix fouthern commence with Libra j but\nthe northern figns have always been confidcred of a more efficacious and\nnoble nature than the fouthern.\nPhilofophers\nOriginal from\nM P I A \/ v r \\ D V m I DI I f* I I D D A D V\nDigitized by Got. ale\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 95\nPhilofophers have alfo afiigncd another reafon for this order and di-\nvifion of the twelve figns of the zodiac, namely. That Nature works by\noppofition and contrariety, and thus brings about the four ftates of all\nelementary bodies, viz. generation, confervation, corruption, and anni\u00ad\nhilation. As therefore generation is the firft ftate, and is produced and\nnourifhed by heat, they begin with the fiery fign Aries. The next\nquality being confervation, or durability, they fignify the fame by\nplacing an earthy fign next in order, lince earth gives permanency and\nfixation to corruptible bodies. The third quality being corruptible,\nit is reprefented by an airy fign, becaufe air is known to be the fource\nof putrefaftion. The laft ftate of an elementary body is its final end,\nor dilfolution; and, as water dilfolves all corruptible bodies, fo have\nthey deferibed it by placing a watery fign the laft of all. In this ar\u00ad\nrangement of the figns of the zodiac we may further obferve, that two\npaflive principles are placed between two active ones j and, as our all\u00ad\nwife 'Creator hath fo conftructed nature, that the oppofition of one\nthing fhould occafion the exiftence or duration of another, fo we may\nobferve it in the divifions of the zodiac j for inftance, Aries, a fiery fign,\nis placed oppofite to Libra, which is an airy fign; and in all refpects\nrefembles a man fitting before a fire with a pair of bellows in his hands,\nblowing to keep it burning : for, without air, fire is foon extinguifhed.\nIn the fame mannfer it is with the water and the earth $ but, to make\nthefe obfervations more apparent, we will arrange the figns of the zodiac\nunder all their different qualities and forms.\nThe Divifions of the Twelve S I G N S of the Z O D I A C .\nSigns oppofite are the f \u00abv \u00bb n s si \u00ab\nt\nt\nNorthern and commanding,\nfirft fix to the laft fix\\ <\na\n>\nn\ni t Y? x\nx Sou\nSome are Mafculine, as r n si a f s Fiery and airy, mafeuline.\nSome are Feminine, as \u00ab es y x Earthy and watery, feminine.\nAiry n <\ne\n= z\nzH\not and moift.\n-Watery aa nj, x Cold and moift*\nEquinoctial \u00abr \u00ab\ne\n\u00bb\nas\n# SI ni ss\nn na t k\nV 25 a Y f\nTropical\nFixed\nCommon\nMoveable\nNo. 5.

So there\nare figns of humanity, as n in & z , and the firft part of \/ ; and in\nnativities where any of thefe figns afcend, or in which the lord of the\nafeendant is placed, itfignifies that the native is of a friendly difpofition.\nhumane, affable, and courteous ; of an excellent carriage, and engaging\nbehaviour.

There are alfo fome figns termed mute, as as nj, x . If\nany of thefe afcend in a nativity, and Mercury, who is the general fig-\nnificator of fpeech, be afflidted by the planet Saturn and the Dragon\u2019s\nTail in an evil houfe of heaven, and the afeendant alfo vitiated, the na\u00ad\ntive will be born dumb ; if Mercury be free, and the afeendant only\nafflidted, or if the afeendant be free, and Mercury afflicted, the native\nwill be generally filent, and flow of fpeech.

The ufe of which is, that, if\nthe principal fignificator in a nativity be pofited in the degrees and figns\nmafeuline, be the native male or female, it argues, that he or fhe fhall\ninherit a more mafeuline temper and refolution than ordinary. But, if\nthe fignificator be in feminine figns and degrees, then the native will be\nmore effeminate, timid, and lefs robuft. The fame obfervation holds\ngood with refpeft to the other figns and degrees, as in the table they\nftand direcled. The fourth column points out that there are certain de\u00ad\ngrees in each fign, which are termed ; and, if either of thefe afeend\n2 in\nDigitized by Go*, sle Original from\nmcxa\/ v n R k ' di im 1r i i r r a d v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 99\nin a nativity, the native will be of a fairer and clearer complexion than\nordinary. The fifth column {hews that there are degrees termed or\nobfcure ;and, whenever thefe happen to be horofcopical in a nativity, they\ndeclare the native to be of a dark or fallow complexion, and, if he fhould\nbe born deformed, his deformity will be confiderably greater. The fixth\ncolumn thews which degrees of the zodiac are called ; and, if any\nof them arife on the eaftern fineter at the time of birth, they declare the\nnative of a mixed complexion, neither fair nor fwarthy, but partaking of\nboth ; and fimilar to his complexion will be his underftanding. The\nfeventh column thews which of the degrees of the zodiac are called void;\nand, if the afcendant in the radix of any nativity be pofited in them, it\ndelares an imbecility in the judgment and underftanding of the native;\nand, the farther he enters into converfation or bufinefs, the more obvious\nwill this defedt appear. The eighth column points out what degrees in\neach of the twelve figns are called deep and pitted; and thefe, in a nativity,\nfignify, that if the afcendant, his lord, or the moon, be fituated in any of\nthem, the native will be of a hafty and imperfedt fpeech, incapable of ex-\npreffing his defires, or of declaring his fentiments and will be always in\u00ad\nvolved in vexatious litigations and difputes j and, like a man in a or\nfnare, will tvant the afliftafice of another to help him out. The ninth\ncolumn diftinguithes the a z i m e n e ,lame, or deficient, degre\nnativity any one of thefe afcend, or the lord of the afcendant, or the mbon,\nbe in any of them, the native will be crooked, lame, or deformed, or in\nfome manner vitiated in the member or part of the body that the fign\ngoverns in which fuch azimene degrees thall happen to be. This rule\nis fo unexceptionable and invariable; that it ought to be well confidered\nin the judgment of every nativity. The tenth column points out all the\ndegrees in the twelve figns that are augmentors or increafers of fortune;\nand the knowledge to be derived from them is, that if, in a nativity,-the\ncufp of the fecond houfe, or lord of the fefrond, Jupiter, or part of for\u00ad\ntune,. be in degrees augmenting, they ^hen '\u25a0\u25a0become arguments of much\nwealth ; and prefage that the native thall, according to his capacity or\nfituation in life, attain to ftill greater honour, riches, and preferment.\nBut, befides thefe general properties, each of the figns potTd's' a parti\u00ad\ncular efficacy and virtue peculiar to themfelves, or to that part of the hea\u00ad\nvens wherein they bear rule. For, as upon earth all ground will not\nbring forth the fame fruit, fo in the heavens all places or parts thereof\nwill not produce the fam$eftcdts. Upon the earth, a man in his journey\nrides over ten miles, more or lefs, upon the fands ; at another time, he\ntraces over as many miles more upon the clay ; and, after that, he pro\u00ad\nceeds on another ten miles upon the marl and gravel.

But, if\nthe planets Jupiter or Venus be in the afeendant, or in this fign, it very\nmaterially alters both the conftitution and complexion of the native for\nthe better; but, if Saturn or Mars be pofited there, then it is altered\nconfiderably for the worfe *.

And firft.\nOf S A T U R N , .\nSaturn is the moft fupreme, or moft elevated, of all the planets, being\nplaced between Jupiter and the firmament, at about feven hundred and\neighty millions of miles from the fun. It travels in its orb at the rate of\neighteen thoufand miles every hour, and performs its annual revolution\nround the fun in twenty-nine years, one hundred and lixty-feven days,\nand five hours, of our tim e; which makes only one year to that planet.\nAnd, though it appears to us no larger than a ftar of the third magnitude,\nyet its diameter is found to be no lefs than lixty-feven thoufand Englifh\nmiles; and confequently near fix hundred times as big as the earth ! This\nplanet is furrounded by a thin broad ring, fomewhat refembling the ho\u00ad\nrizon of an artificial globe j and it appears double when feen through a\ngood telefcope. It is inclined thirty degrees to the ecliptic, and is about\ntwenty-one thoufand miles in breadth j which is equal to its diftance\nfrom Saturn on all lides. There is reafon to believe that the ring turns\nround its axis, becaufe, when it is almoft edge-ways to us, it appears fome\u00ad\nwhat thicker on one fide of the planet than on the other; and the thickefl\nedge has been feen on different lides at different times. But, Saturn hav\u00ad\ning no vifible fpots on his body, whereby to determine the time of his\nturning round his axis, the length of his days and nights and the pofition\nof his axis are wholly unknown to us. He has two degrees forty-eight\nminutes north, and two degrees forty-nine minutes louth, latitude. He\nNo. 5.

His effects, when lord of the afcendant, or prin\u00ad\ncipal ruler of a nativity, with all his qualities, are as follow : he produces\na middle ftature, with a dark, fwarthy, or pale, complexion, fmall leer\u00ad\ning black eyes, broad forehead, lean face, lowering brow, thick nofe\nand lips, large ears, black or brown hair, broad Ihoulders, thin beard,\nwith fmall lean thighs and legs. If this planet is well dignified at the\ntime of birth, the native will be of an acute and penetrating imagination ;\nin his conduct, auftere j in words, referved j in fpeaking and giving, very\nfpare ; in labour, patient; in arguing or difputing, grave j in obtaining\nthe goods of this life, ftudious and l\u2019olicitous ; in his attachments, either\nto wife or friend, conftant and unequivocal ; in prejudice or refentment,\nrigid and inexorable. But, if this planet be ill dignified at the time of\nbirth, the native will be naturally fordid, envious, covetous, miftruftful,\ncowardly, fluggilh, outwardly difiembling, falfe, ftubborn, malicious,\nand perpetually diflatisfied with himfelf, and with all about him. When\nSaturn is oriental, the human ftature will be fhorter than ufual, and, when\noccidental, thin, lean, and lefs hairy. If his latitude be north, the na\u00ad\ntive will be hairy and corpulent j if without any latitude, he will be of\nlarge bones and mufcles $ and, if meridional, fat, fmooth, and flelhy ; in\nhis firft ftation, ftrong and well-favoured ; and, in his fecond ftation,\nweak and ill-favoured. Thefe remarks likewife hold good with refpett\nto all the other planets.

He completes\nhis revolution, ortraverfes through the twelve figns of the zodiac, in eigh-\nty-feven days and twenty-three hours of our time nearly ; which is the\nlength of his year. But being feldom feen, on account of his proximity\nto the fun, and having no fpots vifible on his furface or difk, the time of\nhis rotation upon his own axis, and the length of his days and nights, are\nas yet unknown to us. His didance from the fun is computed to be thir\u00ad\nty-two millions of miles, and his diameter two-thoufand fix hundred.\nHe moves round the fun at the rate of ninety-five thoufand miles every\nhour ; and receives from that luminary a proportion of light and heat al-\nmod feven times as great as that of the earth. At the times he becomes\nvifible, he appears of a bright filver colour, though generally faint and\ndufkifh to the naked eye. His mean motion is fifty-nine minutes and\neight feconds, and fometimes fixty minutes; and his diurnal motion is\nmod times one hundred minutes a day. His greated latitude, both north\nand fouth, is three degrees thirty-three minutes.

When he is in conjunc\u00ad\ntion with a malculine planet, he is mafeuline ; when with a feminine pla\u00ad\nnet, feminine; good and fortunate when joined with the fortunes, but\nevil and mifehievous when in conjunilion with malevolent afpe&s.

But, if occidental, the complexion will be quite fallow, lank\nbody, fmall flender limbs, hollow eyes, of a red cad, and of a dry constitu\u00ad\ntion. If Mercury be well dignified at the nativity, the perfon will inherit\na Strong fubtil imagination, and retentive memory; likely to become an ex\u00ad\ncellent orator and logician, arguing with much eloquence of fpeech, and\nwith Strongpowers of perfuafion.

If brought up in the mercantile line,\nwill be ambitious of excelling in his merchandize, and will moil times\nprove fuccefsful in obtaining wealth. But, be the planet ill-dignified,\nthen the native will betray a difpofition to Slander, and abufe the charac\u00ad\nter of every one without distinction ; he will be a boaSter, a flatterer, a\nfycophant, a bufy-body, a tale-bearer, given to propagate idle tales and\nfalfe Stories ; pretending to all kinds of knowledge, though a mere ideot\nin his intellectual faculty, and incapable of acquiring any folid or fub-\nSlantial learning ; apt to boatt of great honeSty, yet very much addicted\nto mean and petty thievery.\nDtfeafesunder M\ne\nr\nc\nu\nr\ny\n..

His exaltation is in nineteen degrees of Aries ; his detriment in\nAquaries; and his fall in nineteen degrees of Libra. His orb or radiation\nis fifteen degrees before and after all his afpefts. In man, he governs the\nheart back, arteries, the right eye of the male, and left of the female ;\nand the retentive faculty.

Thefe are neither figns nor constella\u00ad\ntions, but are only the nodes or points wherein the ecliptic is interfered\nby the orbits of the planets, and particularly by that of the moon ; making\nwith it angles of five degrees and eighteen minutes. One of thefe points\nlooks northward, the moon beginning then to have northern latitude ;\nand the other points fouthward, where She commences her latitude fouth.\nBut it mull be obferved, that thefe points do not always abide in one place,\nbut have a motion of their own in the zodiac, and retrograde-wife, three\nminutes and eleven feconds per day ; completing their circle in eigh\u00ad\nteen years and two hundred and twenty-five days; fo that the moon can\nbe but twice in the ecliptic during her monthly period ; but at all other\ntimes She will have a latitude or declination from the ecliptic. The head\nof the Dragon is considered of a benevolent nature, and almoSt equivalent\nto one of the Fortunes ; and, when in afpeft with evil planets, is found\nto lefl\u2019\nen their malevolent effefts in a very great degree.

If a planet be in his exaltation, it\ndenotes a perfon of inajeflic carriage, and lofty difpofition, high minded,\nauftere, and proud. If a planet be in his triplicity, the perfon will be\nprofperous and fortunate in acquiring the goods of this life ; no matter\nwhether well or ill descended, or born rich or poor, his condition and\ncircumftances will notwithftanding be promifing and good. If a planet be\nin his terms, it betokens a perfon to participate rather in the nature and\nquality of the planet, than in the wealth, power, and dignity, indicated\nthereby. It a planet be in his phafes, and no otherwife fortified, though\nfignificator, it declares the perfon or thing fignified to be in great dif-\ntrefs, danger, or anxiety.

Jupiter being naturally temperate, and having thefe\namicable afpedts, is deemed the moll benevolent of all the planets to\nmankind, and the greaterfortune.\nMars next in order follows Jupiter, being placed under him ; and\ntherefore thofe fjgns that go before and after the houfes of Jupiter are\nallotted to Mars, viz. Scorpio and Aries, which are in quartile to the\nhoufes of the Sun and Moon, as Aries his day-houfe is to Cancer, and\nScorpio his night-houfe is to Leo. And, fince a quartile is found to be\nan afpedt of enmity, he is accounted malignant and unfortunate in an\ninferior degree to Saturn, who beholds the luminaries with an oppofition,\ntherefore he is called the leff'erinfortune.\nVenus, a more temperate planet, hath appointed unto her thofe houfes\nthat go before the houfes of Mars, viz.

But Scorpio being the fign oppofite to Taurus, in which the de-\ncreafes in light, it is hence allotted for her fall, being the fign immedi\u00ad\nately after Libra, and oppofite to Aries, the houfe of the Sun\u2019s exaltation,\nSaturn, the moft remote planet, is the author of cold, as the Sun is of\nheat, and is therefore exalted in that fign wherein heat is diminished\nand cold increafed, viz. Libra; and his fall takes place in that fign where\ncold is diminifhed and heat increafed, viz. Aries; which are quite con\u00ad\ntrary in nature to the Sun.\nJupiter is exalted in Cancer, and has his fall in Capricorn; for Jupiter\ndelights in the northern part of the heavens, where he ftirs up northern\nwinds, which increafe fertility and vegetation; and, his greateil declina\u00ad\ntion northwards being in Cancer, he is therein exalted. For the con\u00ad\ntrary reafon he has his fall in Capricorn.\nMars is naturally hot and dry; and becaufe his influence and effe&s\nare raoft powerful in Capricorn, a fouthern fign, where the Sun is gene\u00ad\nrally hotteft about noon, he is for this realon exalted therein; and he\ntakes his fall in Cancer, quite contrary to the nature of Jupiter; for\nMars is hot and violent, and Jupiter cold and temperate.\nVenus is naturally moift, efpecially in Pifces, in which fign the fpring\nis moiftened and forwarded in the increafe and ftrength of nature; and\ntherefore fhe has the fign Pifces for her exaltation ; and, as Venus is the\nmother of generation and procreation, ihe has het fall in Virgo, in the\nautumn, when all things wither and fade.\nMercury, becaufe he is dry, and contrary in nature to Venus, is ex\u00ad\nalted in Virgo, and has his fall appointed him in Pifces. Virgo is both\nhis houfe and joy.\nThe T R IP L IC IT IE S of the P L A N E T S .\nA Triplicity means three figns of the Zodiac, of one and the fame\nnature, making a perfect triangle; and of thefe triplicities among the\nfigns there are four, anfwering to the four elements: viz. the fiery tri\u00ad\nplicity, which confifts of Aries, Leo, and Sagittary; the airy triplicity,\nconfifting of Gemini, Libra, and Aquaries; the watery triplicity, con-\nt ining Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifces; and the earthy triplicity, which\nincludes Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Thefe figns apply to each other\nin a trine, in the fame manner as a planet in a fiery fign applies to another\nplanet in a fiery fign (if in the fame number of degrees) in a trine; and\n2 thus\nOriginal from\nM CIM v \/ ^ D i \/ n i m i i f* i i n n a d v\nDigitized by Got. gle\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y , 135\nthus a planet in an airy fign beholds another planet in an airy fign with\na trine; and fo the watery and earihy figns apply in the fame manner;\nand each of thefe trine afpedts confifts of one hundred and twenty degrees.\nThe Sun and Jupiter have dominion over the fiery triplicity; the Sun\nby day, and Jupiter by night. The Sun by day, becaufe he is hot and\nfiery, and of the nature of thefe figns; and Jupiter by night, becaufe he\nis temperate, and moderates the extremity of heat. This is called the\neaftern triplicity.\nSaturn and Mercury have dominion over the airy triplicity, which is\nweftern; Mercury by night, and Saturn by day. But as Libra is the\nexaltation of Saturn, and Aquiries the houfe and Jign wherein he has moil\njoy; and as Gemini is only the houfe of M ercury; it follows that Sa\u00ad\nturn has the principal government in this triplicity.\nMars both night and day governs the watery triplicity, which is nor\u00ad\nthern; and it feems that Mars was appointed to this triplicity to tem\u00ad\nper and abate his violent heat; for we find he is more powerful in his\nmalignant effects in the fign Leo than he is in Cancer; therefore he has\nhis fall appointed him in Cancer, though he is peregrine in Leo.\nVenus and the Moon bear rule over the earthy triplicity, which is fe\u00ad\nminine and fouthern, cold and moift, producing fouth-eafl winds, and\ncold moift air; hence this triplicity is afiigned to the care of feminine\nplanets.\nThe T E R M S of the P L A N E T S .\nA Term is a certain number of degrees, in each houfe or fign of the\nZodiac, wherein the planets Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury,\nhave a certain priority; but the Sun and Moon have no terms. Thefe\ndegrees are called terms, ends, or bounds; for the planets have each their\nproportions fo allotted therein, that at the end of a certain number of GI\ndegrees, the terms of one planet ceafe, and thofe of ahother begin.\nFor inftance, from the firft degree of Aries to the fixth, are the terms\nof Jupiter; from the fixth to the fourteenth, are the terms of Venus;\nand fo of all the reft. Ptolemy, Albumazer, and Bonatus, have all\nfhewn that the greater years of the planets are difeovered by their feve-\nral terms or bounds through the Zodiac; which is done by finding what\nnumber of degrees each of the planets have allotted them in each fign;\nand then, by adding them together, the fum will be the number of each of\ntheir great years, as will appear more obvioufly by the following example:\nNo. 7.

If an infortune has not two dig\u00ad\nnities in a fign, he is placed laft, and the firft term is given either to the\nlord of the exaltation, or to the lord of the triplicity, or to the lord\nof the houfe, uniformly preferring that planet which has two dignities\nto thofe that have only one. But an exception to this rule extends to the\nfigns Cancer and Leo; for Cancer being the oppofite fign to the exalta\u00ad\ntion of Mars, which is in Capricorn, occafions the firft term of Cancer\nto be afligned to Mars ; and, becaufe Leo is the oppofite fign to the houfe\nand joy of Saturn, the firft term of Leo is for this reafon given to Sa\u00ad\nturn. To the infortunes are allotted the laft degrees of all the figns, ex\u00ad\ncepting thofe of Leo, which are given to Jupiter. The quantity of terms\nare divided according to the following method ; when Jupiter and Ve\u00ad\nnus have not two dignities in the fame fign, nor in the fecond, third, or\nfourth, houfe, they have feven degrees allotted for their terms. Saturn\nand Mars, becaufe they are infortunes, (except in their own houfes,) have\nbut five, and fometimes only four, three, or two, degrees each. Mercu\u00ad\nry, becaufe he is of a mixed nature, has ufually fix degrees allotted him ;\nbut, when any of the planets are eflentially dignified, they claim each one\ndegree more; as Venus in the firft term of Taurus has eight degrees, and\nSaturn\nDigitized by Gov ale Original from\nk i p i m v n o r d i m i ir i i b b a r v\n\fOF AS T ROL OGY. . 137\nSaturn in the firft term of Aquaries claims fix. But, becaufe Venus has\neight degrees in Taurus, Saturn has only two, being very weak in Tau\u00ad\nrus ; and again, in Sagittary, Jupiter is increafed one degree, becaufe he\nis ftrong, and Mercury is diminilhed one degree, becaufe he is weak; fo\nthat Jupiter takes eight degrees, and leaves Mercury but five.\nIt is alfo necefiary to obferve, that a planet in his own term is ftrong;\nand that, the more dignities he gains therein, the fironger will his influ\u00ad\nence be; for example, Jupiter in the firft term of Sagittary is ftronger\nand more powerful than in the firft term of Aries, though they are\nboth equally his terms ; and the reafon of this is, becaufe the fign Sa\u00ad\ngittary is both his houfe and triplicity, and Aries is his triplicity only,\nwherefore he has the firft eight degrees of Sagittary for his term, and\nonly fix in Aries. Hence it becomes apparent, that, the nearer a planet is\nin nature to the place of his term, the ftronger will his influence be\ntherein. Jupiter, being hot and moift, has but five degrees for his term\nin Virgo, which is a cold and dry fign ; but in Gemini, which is hot\nand moift, he has fix degrees, becaufe it agrees with his nature; and yet\nin Cancer, which is cold and moift, he poflelLs feven degrees, although\nit does not agree with his nature ; and the reafon is, Cancer is the houfe\nof Jupiter\u2019s exaltation, and therefore the greater term is allotted him.\u2014\nIn like manner, if a planet that is cold and dry be pofited in a term of\nthe fame temperature, his coldnefs and drynefs will be greatly increafed\nthereby, and he will operate the more powerfully in.his influences. The\nfame rule holds good in refpeft to all the other qualities of the planets;\nand it muft be remembered, that a planet is always increafed in ftrength\nby being fituated in houfes or places of his own temperature and quality.\nTh us a planet that is hot and dry lofes much of his natural vigour in a term\nthat is cold and moift; and a planet that is cold and moift lofes confi-\nderably of its nature in a term that is hot and dry. And in like manner,\nif a planet that is a fortune be pofited in a fortunate term, his beneficent\neffedts are the more increafed, and he is fortified with greater power and\nftrength to operate upon whatever fubjedt he is the lignificator of. And\non the contrary, if an evil and malevolent planet be in an evil fign and term,\nits effects will be thereby rendered ftill more mifehievous. And the lord\nof a term when pofited in that term, be the fign what it may, has more\npower therein than the lord of the fign, or than the planet that has the\nfign for its exaltation. Again, if the lord of any term be pofited in his\nterm, and the lord of the lign be fituated in another fign in afpedl with\nhim, the lord of the term will have more power in the fign where he is\nthan the lord of the fign, and {hall be the principal lignificator; but, if\nthe lord of the term be pofited in his own term and fign alfo, then his\nftrength and energy will be ftill more confiderable. It may alfo be ob-\n2 ferved,\nOrigirial from\nM P A f V r * D I f Dl ID I I r I I D D A D V\nDigitized by G O O f i l C\n\f138 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nferved, that, when a planet is weak in a fign, his debility would be very\nmuch lelTened Ihould he chance to be fituated in that part of the lign\nwherein he has terms. Whenever a planet is pofited in a term and fign\nboth of his own nature, it is a very ftrong and fortunate afpeCt.\nThe P H A S E S of the P L A N E T S .\nThe planets\u2019 Phafes confift of the twelve figns of the Zodiac, divided\neach into three equal parts; fo that one phafis contains ten degrees, and\nevery fign three phafes. They are called phafes, becaufe they fignify or\nreprefent the forms, natures, and inclinations, of the feveral planets ap\u00ad\npropriated to them. A planet\u2019s term divides a phafis; a phafis divides a\nlign; a fign divides a tripiicity ; and a triplicity divides the whole Zodiac.\nTo afcertain the proper phafes of each planet, we begin with Mars,\nin the equinoctial fign Aries, becaufe it is the houfe of this planet;\nwherefore the firft ten degrees conftitute the phafis of M ars; the lecond\nten degrees are the phafis of the Sun ; and the third, which make up the\nwhole thirty degrees of Aries, conftitute the phafis of Venus.

The Moon has the fecond phafis in Taurus, and it is the phafis\nof power, ambition, and authority ; of violent force, compulfion, and ar\u00ad\nbitrary fway.

T he reafon\nis, that in Aquaries he has both houfe and triplicity, and is therefore bet\u00ad\nter dignified, and more potent, in Aquaries than in Capricorn. So like-\nwife Jupiter joyeth in Sagittary, and not in Pifces, becaufe in the former\nfign he has both houfe and triplicity, but in the latter he has houfe\nonly. The fame obfervation extends to the other planets. The Moon,-\nindeed, has no triplicity; but Ihe joyeth in Cancer, becaufe it is a fign\nof her own quality and nature. Hence it appears that Saturn, though ftrong\nand well dignified in Capricorn, is much ftrongcr, and has more digni\u00ad\nties, in Aquaries; Jupiter alfo\u00bb has ftrong influences when polked in\nPifces, but much ftronger in Sagittary; Mars is potent in Aries, but\ninfinitely more fo in Scorpio; Venus has great operation in Libra, but\nin Taurus her effects are more powerful; and Mercury, for the fame\ncaufe, operates much more forcibly in Virgo than he does in the fign*\nGemini. The efficacy of thefe rules having been proved by repeated\nexperience, it is neceflary for every ftudent to confider them with at\u00ad\ntention.\n\u2014 *\nThe A N T I S C I O N S of the P L A N E T S .\nA planet\u2019s Antifcion is a certain virtue or influence it acquires by be\u00ad\ning pofited in conjunction with any ftar or planet, in degrees equally dif-\ntant from the two tropical figns. Cancer and Capricorn, in which degrees,\nthe Sun, when it arrives, occafions equal day and night all over the world.\nFor example, when the Sun is in the tenth degree of Taurus, he is as far\ndiftant from the firft degree of Cancer as when in the twelfth degree of\nLeo; therefore, when the Sun, or any planet, is pofited in the tenth degree\nof Taurus, it fends its antifcion to the twentieth degree of Leo; that\nis, it gives additional force and virtue to any planet at that time in the\nfame degree by conjunction, or that cafteth any afpeCt to it.

Thefe antifcions are confidered, in the rules of aftrology, equi\u00ad\nvalent to a fextile or a trine, particularly if the planets are of the\nbenevolent or fortunate kind. Thefe planets have alfo their contra-anti-\nfcions, which are of the nature of a quartile, or oppofition. To know\n' where thefe fall, it only requires to find the antifcion, and in the oppo-\nfite fign to that will be the contra-antifcion. For inftance, luppofe Ju\u00ad\npiter in one degree of Aries, his antifcion will then fall in twenty-nine\ndegrees of Virgo, and his contra-antifcion in twenty-nine degrees of\nPifccs, becaufe Pifces is the fign immediately oppofite to Virgo, where\nthe antifcion falls.\nThe A S P E C T S of the P L A N E T S .\nThe ftrongeft or moft forcible rays, afpeCts, or configurations, pecu\u00ad\nliar to the planets, are the following: a conjunction, denoted by this\ncharacter, 6 ; a trine, a ; a quartile, o ; afextile, * ; and an oppofition, \u00a7 .\nA conjunction, <5, is not properly an afpeft, though frequently fo call\u00ad\ned ; for, when two planets are both in the fame degree and minute of a\nfign, they are faid to be in conjunction, confequently cannot at that time\nbe in afpeCt to each other. The effefts of conjunctions are either good\nor bad according to the nature and quality of the planets that compofe\nthem, or as the planets in conjunction are friends or enemies to one\nanother, or to the fubjeCt then under confideration.\nA fextile afpeCt, * , implies two of the heavenly bodies pofited at the\ndiftance of fixty degrees in longitude, or one fixth part of the Zodiac,\n* The Antifcions, according to the fyftem of Argol and Morinus, are followed here, though\ndifcontinued by fome modern profeffors.

The Textile is termed an afpedt of imperfedl love,\namity, or friendfhip; becaufe when two planets, or fignificators, are in\nTextile to each other, they import that any matter in difpute, treaty of\nmarriage, or other fubjedt of enquiry, may be happily terminated, or\nbrought about, by the intervention of friends; or that for want thereof,\nthe contrary may happen. And, though the Textile afpedt is Tometimes\nover-ruled by the more powerful influences of malignant ones, yet it\nis generally confldered an omen of the favourable kind.\nBy a quartile afpedt o , two planets are underftood to be poflted at\njjinety degrees, or one fourth part of the circle of the Zodiac, from each\nother; is confldered an afpect of imperfedl hatred, and adts\nwith the fextile, inclining rather to malignancy, contention, and mis\u00ad\nfortune, as the other does to friendfhip, harmony, and good fortune.\nA trine afpedt a , imports the planets to be fituated at the diltance of\none hundred and twenty degrees, or one third part of the circle of the\nZodiac, from each other; and is fometimes called a trigonal afpedt, or\na trigonocrater, implying rule or dominion in a certain trigon or tripli-\ncity. This is an afpedt of the moft perfedt unanimity, friendfhip, and\npeace; and it is fo confldered, becaufc when the planets are in a a afpedt,\nthey are poflted in figns precifely of the fame triplicity and nature; that\nis to fay, they are both in an earthy, airy, fiery, or watery, fign; and\nconfequently both contribute the fame influences unimpeded. But in a\ni* . which is an afpedt of imperfedl amity, the planets are poflted in\nfigns of only a partial nature, viz. fiery with an airy, or an earthy with a\nwatery, fign; and as the fiery fign is hot and and the airy hot and\nthe earthy cold and d\nr\ny, and the watery cold and , fo the planets\nthus poflted, agreeing only in one point out of two, give but an imperfedl\ninfluence. Thus the diflindlions between a * and a a afpedt, and between\na \u25a1 and g , are founded in reafon and experience.\nThe oppofition g of two planets, fignifies their being poflted at one\nhundred and eighty degrees, or juft half the diftance of the Zodiac, apart,\nwhich places them in a diametrical radiation. This is confldered an afpedl\nof perfedt hatred, or of inveterate malice and enmity, as malignant in\nits effedls, as the trine is benevolent; and of double the deftrudtive ten\u00ad\ndency of the \u25a1 afpedt. To inftance this, let us fuppofe two kingdoms,\nftates, focieties, or private gentlemen, at variance, and it is enquired whe\u00ad\nther the caufe of difpute may be amicably adjufted? If a figure be eredted\nNo. 7.

But, if the fignificators are found in\nactual oppofition, the difpute in queftion would moft probably occafion\nhoftility, war, litigation, or duel, or be attended with fome alarming con-\nfequences, before the matter would fubfide. Wherefore an \u00a7 is juftly\ntermed an afped of perfed enmity.\nThefe afpeds are all divided, for the fake of perfpicuity, into\nand platicafpeds. A partile afped confiders two planets exadly fo many\ndegrees from each other as make a perfed afped j that is, if Venus be\nin nine degrees of Aries, and Jupiter in nine degrees of Leo, they are in\npartile trine afped. Again, if the Sun be in one degree of Taurus, and\nthe Moon in one degree of Cancer, they are in a partile fextile afped; fo\nthat all perfed afpeds are partile, and imply the matter or thing threat\u00ad\nened, whether good or evil, to be near at hand.\nBy a platic afped, we are to underftand two planets fo pofited, as to\nadmit half the degrees of each of their own rays or orbs; for i-nftance, ,\nif Saturn be pofited in fixteen degrees of Aries, and Jupiter in twenty-\nfour degrees of Gemini, then Saturn would be in a platic fextile afped\nto Jupiter, becaufe Saturn would be fituated within the moiety of both\ntheir orbs, which are nine degrees each. The fame circumftance ap\u00ad\nplies to the afpeds of all the planets; for if their diftance from each other\nbrings them within one half of each of their orbs or radiations, when add\u00ad\ned together, they will then form a platic afped. It mull alfo be care\u00ad\nfully obferved in thefe platic afpeds, whether the co-operation of the\ntwo planets is going off, or coming on. In the above example, the ef-\nfed of Saturn\u2019s platic fextile afpe6t with Jupiter was going off; but if\nwe reverfe their lituations, and place Saturn in twenty-four degrees of\nGemini, and Jupiter in fixteen degrees of Aries, then the afped would\nbe coming on with all its force and influence, and would proportionably\naffed the fubjed, whatever it be, under confideration.\nTo enable the reader to find the platic afpects more readily, I fubjoin\nthe following table of the planets\u2019 orbs, mean motion, and latitude.\nTABLE\n\/\n*Google Original from\nMP A f V n D l f D l i m i r i l O D A D V\n\fOF AS TROLOGY. 145\nTABLE of the ORBS andM\nEANMOTIONof thePLANETS.\nOrbs \u2022 Mean Motion.\nSaturn 10 degrees 2 minutes 1 fecond\nJupiter 12 degrees 4 minutes 59 feconds\nMars 7 degrees 31 minutes 27 feconds\nMoon 12 degrees 30 min. 13 deg. 10 min. 36 fee\nVenus 8 degrees 59 minutes 8 feconds\nMercury 7 degrees 30 min. 59 minutes 8 feconds\nSun 17 degrees 59 minutes 8 feconds\nT A B L E of the P L A N E T S ' L A T I T U D E .\nSaturn\nJupiter\nMars\nMoon\nVenus\nMercury\nNorth Latitude.\nD.

The fame rules apply throughout the table; but\nit muft not be forgot, that finifter afpects go in the fame order with the\nlign6 of the Zodiac, and dexter contrariwife; and that the dexter\nafpects are more ftrong and powerful than the finifter. And thus, ac\u00ad\ncording to the operations of the planets and ftars, are the natures of all\nmen, as the planets have predominancy in them; and fuch are the na\u00ad\ntures of all manner of herbs and plants that grow in the field. Some\nare influenced by Saturn, and thence are cold and dry; others by\nJupiter, and thence are hot and moift; one by an order of Mars draws\nnothing but poifon to its roots; and another by the fweet influence of\nVenus fucks nothing but the fweet Tap of the earth into all it fibres.\nIf Saturn or Mars rife with a birth, it is ten to one but the child dies\nthat year, unlefs Jupiter or Venus interpofe, by throwing their friendly\nI influences ftrongly into the fign. And in thefe refpects we have as in-\nj f ' conteftible proofs of the truth of what we advance, as the phyfician has\nf\nof the nature of herbs when he taftes them; he, from that demonftra-\ntion, declares them to be hot or cold, and good either to cure or kill;\nbut we can afcertain this without tailing them, becaufe we know the\nfource from whence they derive thefe oppofite qualities.\nIt were needlefs for me to dwell longer upon an explanation of the\ndifferent virtues and effects of the planets and figns.

Direction is alfo a cal\u00ad\nculus, whereby to find the time of any accident or remarkable event that\nwill happen to the perfon who propounds a queftion, or has his nativity\ncaft. For inftance, a perfon enquires how many years he may live, by\nthe courfe of the planets at the time of birth? Having eftablifhed the\nSun, Moon, or afcendant, as fignificators of life, and Mars or Saturn as\npromittors or portentors of death, the direction is a calculation of the\nlength of time in which the fignificator will be in meeting the promittor;\nand this refolves the queftion. In thefe calculations, the fignificator is\nfometimes termed apheta, or giver of life, and the promittor anareta, or\ngiver of death. The directions of all the principal points of the heavens,\nplanets, and fixed ftars, as the afcendant, mid-heaven.

The fe-\ncond kind is formed by two retrograde planets; as, fuppofing Mercury\nin fixteen degrees of Gemini, and Saturn in fifteen degrees of the fame\nfign, both retrograde. Mercury, being the lighter planet, applies to the\nbody of Saturn, a more ponderous planet, by retrogradation; and this is\ntermed a retrograde application. The third kind is occafioned by one\nplanet going direCt in motion, and meeting another planet that is retro\u00ad\ngrade; for inftance, fuppofe Mercury retrograde in fixteen degrees of\nGemini, and Saturn dirc61 in twelve degrees of the fame fign; here\nMercury, being the lighter planet, applies to a conjunction of Saturn by\na retrograde motion; and thefe two laft are deemed evil applications. It\nmuft alfo be obferved that the fuperior planets never apply to the inferior\nbut by a retrograde motion; whereas the inferior planets apply both ways.\nSeparation is underftood of two planets that have either been in\npartile conjunction or afpeCt, and are juft departed or feparated from\nit. Thus, if we fuppofe Saturn in twelve degrees of Sagittary, and Ju\u00ad\npiter in thirteen degrees of the fame fign, Jupiter will be then feparated\none degree from a perfeCt or partile conjunction with Saturn; but they\nwould ftill be in a platic conjunction, becaufe they are within the moiety\nof each other\u2019s radiations, which is four degrees and a half each, confe-\nquently thefe planets would continue in platic conjunction until they\nwere feparated nine degrees, and then the afpeCt would entirely ceafc.\nThe exaCi knowledge of every degree of the feparations of thefe alpecis\nis of the utmoft confequence in giving judgment upon various impor\u00ad\ntant occafions. For inftance, fuppofe it were demanded whether a cer\u00ad\ntain treaty of marriage would take place or not? When all the afpeCts\nare collected upon the horofcope, and the two planets, that are fignifica-\ntors of the parties, are found applying to each other in a conjunction,\nand in common or fixed figns, the marriage may probably take place in\nfome length of time. If the fignificators are pofited in moveable figns,\nangular, and approaching fwift in motion to a conjunction, it may then\nbe confummated in a very ihort time; but, if the fignificators are fepara\u00ad\nted from a conjunction only a few minutes of a degree, one may fafely\nconclude that there has been great probability, only a few days .before,\nthat the wedding would have taken place; but by this afpeCt the parties\nappear to be hanging in fufpence, and fome diflike or change of fenti-\nment feems to have taken place: and, as the fignificators gradually.fepa-\nrate from the partile and platic conjunctions, in the fame gradation will\nthe treaty and afFeCtions of the parties alienate and wear avH&A|^and,>\nby\nthe comparative time that the afpeCt will occupy before it d H n lw jafes,\nfo will the time be fo many weeks, months, or year bef<\u00a3Pffl|HPties\nfhall wholly rclinquifh the connexion.\nIITION\nDigitized by Goc gle Original from\nV n D k ' Dl ID I i r I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 149\nP rohibition indicates the Rate of two planets that are fignificators\n- of fome event, or the bringing of fome bufinefs to an itfue or conclufion,\nand are applying to each other by conjunction; but, before fuch conjunc\u00ad\ntion can be formed, a third planet, by means of a fwifter motion, inter-\npofes his body, and deftroys the expected conjundlion, by forming an\nafpedt himfelf; and this indicates that the matter under contemplation\nwill be greatly retarded, or utterly prevented. For example, fuppofe\nMars was pofited in feven degrees of Aries, Saturn in twelve degrees,\nand the Sun in fix degrees, of the fame fign ; Mars is the fignificator of\nthe bufinefs in hand, and promifes the itfue or completion of it fo foon\nas he comes to a conjunction with Saturn; but the Sun, being fwifter in\nmotion than Mars, pafieshim, and prevents their conjunction, by forming\nthe afpedt himfelf. This indicates, that whatever was expected from the\napproaching conjunction of Mars and Saturn is now prohibited by the\nSun\u2019s firft impediting Mars and then Saturn; and this is termed a conjunc\u00ad\ntional or bodily prohibition. There is alfo a prohibition by afpedt, either\nfextile, quartile, trine, or oppolition; and this happens when two pla\u00ad\nnets are going into conjunction. Suppofe Mars to be in feven degrees of\nAries, Saturn in thirteen degrees of the fame fign, and the Sun in five\ndegrees of Gemini; the Sun, being fwifter than Mars in his diurnal mo\u00ad\ntion, will quickly overtake him, and pafs by the fextile dexter of Mars,\nand form a fextile dexter with Saturn, before Mars can reach him; by\nthis means their conjunction is prohibited.\nF r u str atio n imports a fwift or light planet approaching to an\nafpedt with one more flow and ponderous; but, before they can approach\nnear enough to form that afpedt:, the weighty planet is joined to fome\nother, by which the firft al'pedt is fruftrated., To inftance this, fuppofe\nSaturn pofited in fixteen degrees of Gemini, Jupiter in fifteen degrees of\nLeo, and Mars in eleven degrees of the fame fign; here Mars applies to\na conjunction with Jupiter, but, before he can reach it, Jupiter meets\na fextile afpedt from Saturn, which fruftrates the conjunction of Mars,\nand, in practice, utterly deftroys whatever was promifed by it.\nR ef r a n a t io n is the Rate of a planet in direct motion, applying to\nan afpect or conjunction with another planet, but before they can meet\nbecomes retrograde, and thus rejrains to form the afpedt expected.

This happens when a light\nplanet feparates from a weighty one, and joins with another more pon\u00ad\nderous, and is effe&ed in this manner: let Saturn be placed in twenty\ndegrees of Aries, Jupiter in thirteen degrees, and Mars in fourteen de\u00ad\ngrees, of the fame fign; here Mars feparates from a conjunction with Ju\u00ad\npiter, and tranflates the light and nature of that planet to Saturn, to whom\nhe next applies. The effeCt of this in practice will be, that, if a matter or\nthing be promifed by Saturn, then whoever was reprefented by Mars\n(hall procure all the affiftance that the benevolent planet Jupiter could\nbellow', and tranflate it to Saturn, whereby the bufinefs in hand would be\nthe better effected, and more happily concluded; and this, being a very\nfortunate pofition of the planets, is very proper to be known, fince it pro-\njnifes much in law-fuits, marriages, and all other queltions of the kind.\nR eception is when two planets, that are fignificators in any queffion\nor nativity, are pofited in each other\u2019s dignity, as the Sun in Aries, and\nMars in Leo, which is a reception by houfes, and is deemed the molt\npowerful and efficacious of all receptions. But reception may be by ex\u00ad\nchange of triplicity, term, or phafe, or by any effential dignity; as Venus\nin Aries, and the Sun in Taurus, is a reception by triplicity, if the quef-\ntion or nativity happen by day. Or if Venus be in the twenty-fourth\ndegree of. Aries, and Mars in the fixteenth degree of Gemini, it is a re\u00ad\nception by terms. The ufe of thefe pofitions, in practice is confiderable;\nfor, fuppofe the event of any queffion required be denied by the afpeCts;\nor the fjgnificators are in no afpeCt with each other; or it is doubtful\nwhat may happen from a quartile or oppolition of the fjgnificators; yet,\nif the principal fignificators are found in mutual reception, the thing\ndefired will Ihortly come to pafs, and probably to the fatisfaCtion and\ncontent of all the parties concerned.\nP er eg rina tio n defcribes a planet to be fituated in a fign, or in\nfuch certain degrees of a fign, where it has no effential dignity, either\nby houfe, exaltation, triplicity, term, or phafe; as Saturn in the tenth\ndegree of Aries, is peregrine; and the Sun in any part of Cancer, is\nperegrine, having no dignity whatever in that fign. In all queftions of\ntheft, it is very material to know the peregrine planet; for it has been\nuniformly found, by almoft every regular profeffor of this Art, that the\nthief may be almoff conftantly difcovered by the peregrine pi met pofited\nin an angle, or in the fecond houfe.\nCombustion is the ftate of a planet, when fituated wir'im eight de\u00ad\ngrees thirty minutes of the body of the Sun, either befj. \/- \u2022- tf'er him.\nSuppofe Mercury in the twenty-fuff degree, the Sun in the \u25a0\n\u25a0\n-enty-fifth\ndegrafr-\nDigitized by Gc\nk gle \u25a0 A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 151\ndegree, and Venus in the twenty-feventh degree of Aquaries; here\nMercury and Venus would be both combuft; but Venus would be\nmore affcdted by it than Mercury, becaufe the Sun applies to or moves\ntowards Venus, and recedes from Mercury, whereby his rays afflidt her\nmore forcibly on his nearer approach, and become weaker upon Mercury\nby his recefs from him.\nC a z i mi reprefents a planet in the heart of the Sun; that is, if a planet\nbe only feventeen minutes before or after the Sun, as if the Sun were in\nfifteen degrees thirty minutes of Taurus, and Mercury in fifteen degrees\ntwenty minutes of the fame fign, Mercury would be then in cazimi, or\nin the heart of the Sun. All authors agree that a planet in cazimi is for\u00ad\ntified thereby, and is of greater efficacy ; whereas a planet in combuftion\nis of a malignant nature. If the fignificator of a querent, orperfon pro\u00ad\npounding a queftion, be combuft, it fhews him or her to be under fearful\napprehenfions, and threatened to be over-powered, or greatly injured, by\nfome fuperior perfon. It ffiould be carefully oblerved, that all planets\nmay be in combuftion with the Sun, but the Sun cannot be in combuftion\nwith any planet; and that combuftion can only be by perfonal conjunc\u00ad\ntion in one fign, and not by any afpedl, either fextile, quartile, trine, or\noppofition ; the Sun\u2019s quartile or oppofite afpedts are afflifcting, but they do\nnot combure, or render the planet combuft. A planet is always confi-\ndered under the fun-bcams, until he is elongated feventeen degrees before\nor after his body.\nV oid of Course, is when a planet is feparated from another planet,\nand does not, during its continuance in that fign, form an afpedt with any\nother. This raoft ufually happens with the Moon; and in pradtice, it is\nobferved, that, if the fignificator of the thing propounded be void of\ncourfe, the bufinefs under contemplation will not fucceed, nor be attend\u00ad\ned with any fatisfadtory or pleafing confequences.\nB e s ie g in g , fignifies a planet fituated betwixt the two malevolent pla\u00ad\nnets Saturn and Mars; for inftance, if Saturn were placed in the twelfth\ndegree of Aries, Mars in the fixteenth, and Jupiter in the fourteenth, de\u00ad\ngree, Jupiter would then be befieged by Saturn and Mars.\nI ncreasing in L i g h t , is when a planet is feparating from the Sun\nor the Sun from a planet; thus the Moon, at her greateft diftance from\nthe Sun,\u2018appears with the greateft: degree of light, having her whole\norb illumined.\nNo. 8.

By this\noperation, the whole globe or fphere will be apportioned into twelve\nequal parts, which conflitute what we call, twelve houfes of heaven.\nAnd thefe houfes, as observation and experience abundantly fhew, make\nup that great wheel of nature, whereon depends the various fortunes con\u00ad\ntingent to all fublunary matters and things.\nIn this divifton of the heavens, the firfl quadrant is deferibed by a pa\u00ad\nrallel line, drawn from the point of theeaft angle to the fouth, or mid\u00ad\nheaven ; and contains the twelfth, eleventh, and tenth, houfes, called the\noriental, vernal, mafeuline,' fanguine infant quarter.

The third quadrant is formed by a parallel\nline running from the extreme point of the eighth houfc to the north\nangle; and contains the fixtb, fifth, and fourth, houfes, called the occi\u00ad\ndental, autumnal, mafeuline, melancholic, manly, cold and dry, quar\u00ad\nter.

This rule holds good from the tenth houfe to the\nfeventh; the feventh to the fourth, and fo on through the whole; but\nit fhould always be remembered that planets in angles, that is, thofe\nwhich are feated in the angular houfes, are the moft forcible and potent in\ntheir operation.\nThe firft houfe,. which is denoted by the figure 1, is called the afcen\u00ad\ndant, becaufe, the point of its angle being level with the horizon, what\u00ad\never planet afeends from under the earth muft afeend upon this line, and\nbecome vifible firft in this houfe. The line upon which the planets\nafeend, or move, is called the cufp of the houfes; and that of the afcen\u00ad\ndant is generally reejeojied to extend about five degrees above the earth\nand twenty-five degrees beneath, ready to afeend. But, if figns of long\nafeenfions alcend, then half five degrees above the earth, and thirteen be\u00ad\nlow, are its utmoft limits. If figns of fhort afeenfions afeend, then five\ndegrees *bove the horizon, and fifty degrees below, are ufually allowed.\nNow thp quality of whatfoever part of the heavens occupies or fills up the\ndegreesfcf this houfe, carries along with it the health, life, and nature, of\nevery infant or thing that is conceived or brought forth within itsjurifdic-\ntion.

For, as the feed in the ground, after it has\ntaken root, buds forth, and appears above ground, fo the heavenly in\u00ad\ntelligencers, after they have framed the embryo, and the temperament\nthereof, under the earth, give it life and being of its own, putting forth\nlevel with them juft as they afeend.

And, whatever part of the heavens\nhappens to be culminating in this point at the birth of any perfon or\nthing, that takes charge of, and carries along with it, ever after, the pre\u00ad\nferment, honour, profeflion, fituation, and authority, of the native; and,\nas the nature of the planets, ftars, afpedls, and heavenly matter, happens\nto be, that are fituated in this point, or in the degrees pertaining to it,\nfo (hall the native prove in his life-time, in point of dignity, advancement,\nand reputation, in this world, whether high or low, fortunate or unfor\u00ad\ntunate, favoured or difgraced. The attendants upon, and upholders of,\nman\u2019s honour and dignity, as the Scriptures and every day\u2019s experience\nperpetually (hew us, are wealth and fervants. The firft of thefe is at\u00ad\ntached to the midheaven in a fuccedent houfe, called the fecond houfeof\nheaven j and the other in a cadent houfe, called the fixth houfe of heaven j\nand thefe two are iituated in an harmonious trine with the angular point\nof the midheaven. And now well obferve what the planets, liars, af-\npedts, and heavenly matters, are in either of thefe houfes at the time of\nbirth, and fuch {hall the native\u2019s fortune prove in point of riches and\nfubordinate dependants; in the firft of thefe houfes for wealth, and in\nthe other for fervants or dependants.\nThe third angle of the figure of heaven is the feventh houfe, or point\nof the heavens and degrees contingent, which are always or\nfetting out of our horizon, and finking under the earth; and this point\nis diredtly oppofite to the eaftern angle or afeendant. Now, as the rifing\nheaven, or afeendant, is the beginning and conduit of life, fo this fet\u00ad\nting heaven, level with the afeendant, is the bringing all mundane\naffairs level with life, fuch as our entrance into the ftate of marriage;\nour contracts and enterprifes in bufinefs, war, and travel; and our con\u00ad\nnections and fuccefs therein, whether with friends, ftrangers, or enemies;\nand thefe whether honeft men, parafites, or thieves. And the heavenly\nmatter, planets, ftars, and afpedls, fituated in this angle at a nativity, appa\u00ad\nrently thew how a man {hall fare in refpedt to wives, more or lefs, any or\nnone, good or bad; and, in matters of bufinefs or adventure, how fortu\u00ad\nnate or unfortunate he may be likely to prove; and, with enemies or\nthieves, how far he is likely to be injured by them. Neceflary upholders\nof marriage, fupporters in trade and travel, and defenders againft thieves,\n^plunderers, and enemies, are friends, relations, and neighbours. And\nthefe, in a trine to the feventh houfe, are brought forth, the firft out of\nthe eleventh houfe of heaven, a fuccedent houfe, and the other out of the\nthird houfe of heaven, a cadent houfe.

And, as that thews what\na man in the courfe of nature (hall rife to in the world, this, on the con\u00ad\ntrary, declares what and when fhall be his fall, decay, and death. This\nhoufe has therefore fignification of the end of every worldly concern,\nand, amongft other ends, of the grave, which is the end of all men liv\u00ad\ning, however dignified or great. And the planets, ftars, and afpeCts, po-\nfited in this houfe at the time of birth, never fail to (hew what kind of\nend the native is likely to.find; for, as the twelve figns have each their\nparticular and vifible effects upon and over every part of man\u2019s body, and\nas the planets and their afpcCts fflew in what fign the native fflall be im-\npedited, that is, in what part of the body the root of his natural infirmity\nmail be placed, and what accidents fhall befal him during life, fo is it\nan eafy procefs to point out the manner of his death, and whether natural,\nhonourable, or ignominious. The upholders of this angle are the houfes\nof tribulation and death; the one a fuccedent houfe, called the eighth\nhoufe, or houfe of death; and the other a cadent houfe, called the twelfth\nhoufe. And now let it be carefully obferved what planets, ftars, afpeCts,\nand heavenly matter, occupy thofe houfes at the time of nativity; and\nthey fhall point out, in the twelfth houfe, all the principal misfortunes,\nafflictions, and tribulations, of the native\u2019s life, and in the eighth houfe\n' the time and manner of his death.\nIndependent of the faculties hitherto fjpecified, each of thefe houfes of\nheaven have other fignificators and effeas, which they demonftrate in\nvarious other ways. For inftance, the afcendant reprefents the native\ncoming into th* world, and the fourth houfe at the fame time repre\u00ad\nfents the parents of the native going out ; for\nanother always comesm-f*, according to the courfe of nature. Of thefe\nparents, the father is more efpecially fignified by the fourth houfe;\nand then, fecondarily, but not fo forcibly, the mother of the native is fig\u00ad\nnified by the tenth houfe, and the grandfather by the feventh; and uncles,\naunts, and relations, on the father\u2019s fide, by the fixth; and uncles, aunts.\nt See Ecclef. i 4.\nand\nGooole Original from\nM C I A \/ V O D m ID I I r I I D D A D V\n\fu\nu\ni\ni\ni\nd\ni\nn\n,\nu\nu\nu\ny\ni\ne\n-\nu\ni\ny\ni\nu\nc\ne\nu\n\/\ni\nill\n|\nj\n.\n\/\n\/\nw\nw\nv\nv\n.\ni\ni\nd\ni\ni\nm\nu\nu\nb\ni\n.\nu\ni\ny\n\/c\niL\n.L\n.t:b\nb\n_\nu\nb\ne\n-ff-iJ\nU\n-y\nu\nu\ny\nie\n:\nF A S T R O L O G Y . 161\nand relations, on the mother's fide, by the twelfth. Hence alfo it comes\nto pals, that by the fourth houfe are fignified houfes and lands, and all de\u00ad\ngrees of patrimony, left by the father; and by the eighth houfe are fhewn\nall goods and legacies left by will of the deceafed. The fecondand fixth\nhoufes in half-trine to the houfe of the grave, and in oppofition to the\neighth and twelfth, have a fecondary fignification of ficknefs and death.\nSuch are the qualities and operations of the twelve houfes of heaven\nin the common courfe of nature; but thefe qualities are fometimes ma\u00ad\nterially altered, and changed for the better or worfe, by means either of\nthe Moon or fame other of the celeftial'motions or affe&ions. It is cer\u00ad\ntain that the Moon circleth the earth once in every twenty-eight days; but\nin this perambulation fhe neither keeps the Sun\u2019s pathway in the ecliptic,\nnor continues her courfe conflantly on the fame fide of it; but once in\nevery fourteen days fhe croffes the ecliptic, alternately to her north and\nfouth declination; and it is found by long and correct observation, that\nthe point in the heavens where fhe croffes this line is very firongly af-\nfedted by her motion. The Moon is the great body of life and growth;\nand, when fhe paffes the ecliptic to the north, which brings her nearer\ninto this northern world, fhe then gives an extraordinary degree of fruit-\nfulnefs, which wonderfully flrengthens with its influence whatfbeyer\nhappens within the line of its jurifdidtion. And this point, wherever it\nfalls, is called the Moon\u2019s north node, but is diftinguiffied in afirological\nworks by the name of the Dragon\u2019s Head, as already explained in page\n125. If this point happens to afeend in a nativity, it ftrengthens life with\na robuft and lively conltiunion; if it falls in the midheaven, it promifes\ngreat honour and preferment; if in the eleventh houfe, profperity and\nriches. If Jupiter or Venus happen to be in thefe degrees, it makes them\nmuch flronger and more efficacious in their benevolent operations; but,\nif Saturn or Mare be pofited there, it gives them, on the contrary, a\nftronger inclination to prove mifehievous and unfortunate. When the\nMoon interfefts the ecliptic line to her fouthern declination, fhe leaves\nthat point of the heavens where fhe croffes it, which is termed the Dra\u00ad\ngon\u2019s Tail, as barren to all intents and purpofes as the other was fruitful.\nHence this point afeending at a nativity blemifhes life, and leaves a ftain\nupon it; impairs honour and advancement in the midheaven, and^waftes\nriches, and brings adverfity, in the eleventh houfe; and it weakens as well\nthe benevolent a ufpices of Jupiter and Venus as the evil inclinations of\nSaturn and Mars. How theiie circumflances operate beyond the equinoc\u00ad\ntial, experience is yet filent; but it feems reasonable to fuppofe that the\nDragon\u2019s Tail is there the fruitful point, and the Head the barren point,\nfince, when the Moon is going off from us, her influences mufl he coming ,\non with them.\nNext\nDigitized by Go*, gle Original from\nMCiAf v r s D is ni 1d 1 \\ r 1 i d d a d v\n\faifSnnfi-nrl-w-s<;n\nQ\nc\na\nn\np\n\/\nf\ni\ni\nm\nc\n;\nn\nn\nn\ni\ni\np\ni\ni\n-\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n\/\n\/\n:\nr\nh\nn\ni\n\/\nn\na\n7\nn\ni\nf\ni\ni\nn\n-\na\ni\nf\ni\nn\nn\nn\n'\nn\ni\nP\ni\nn\nn\nr\n*\n162 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nNext to the nodes, the Part of Fortune has its operations upon thefe\ntwelve celeftial houfes. The point, which we term the Part of Fortune,\nis the diftance of the Moon\u2019s place from the Sun\u2019s, added to the degrees\nof the afcendant; and the nature of it is, as conftant obfervation afcer-\ntains, that, if this point falls among fortunate ftars, or in a fortunate part\nof the heavens, then it promifes great fuccefs in health or wealth, honour\nor offspring, or any other fpecies of profperity, according as it is feated\neither in the firft, eleventh, or fifth, houfes, or in any others. The rea-\nfon of this appears to be, that the Sun, Moon, and Afcendant, being the\nprime conduits through which the flream of life flows, this feat of the\nPart of Fortune is the harmony of all three concentering and uniting in\nthe fame adts of benevolence.\nNow, befides thefe, there are yet other qualities, accidentally affedted,\nwhich concern either particular perfons or times. Thus, the places of\nSaturn, or Mars, or the Tail of the Dragon, in the vernal figure, are un\u00ad\nfortunate in the higheft degree for the whole of that year; or, if they\nhappen in any of the quarter figures, they portend affliction and mif-\nfortune for that quarter. But the places of Jupiter and Venus in a ver\u00ad\nnal figure are as fortunate as the others are unfortunate for the fame time.\nThe places of an eclipfe of the Sun or Moon, and of the comets, are alfo\nfortunate or unfortunate, as their fituation may be, or as perfons, coun\u00ad\ntries, or ftates, may be concerned in them. The place of Saturn or Mars\nin a man\u2019s nativity proves unfortunate to him all the days of his life; and\nthe place in either of them in a revolutional figure is equally bad for that\nyear. But the place of Jupiter or Venus in a nativity, or in a revolu\u00ad\ntional figure, is always as fortunate, either for a man\u2019s life-time, or for\nthe year, as the other is unfortunate. Alfo the places of the twelfth\nhoufe, or eighth, or fixth, as they were in the native fcheme, have always\nbad fignifications unto a man, whenfoever they come up upon any of his\nconcerns. And the places of the tenth houfe, of the eleventh, of the\nafcendant, and of the fecond houfe, generally promife as much good as\nthe other houfes do evil upon all the common occafions of life.\nThus far we have feen the operations of the twelve houfes of heaven,\nas they appertain to the time and circumftances of a nativity. We fhall\nnow explain their properties in that fyftem of nature upon which the\ndo&rine of horary questions is grounded. And fuch has been the induf-\ntry and indefatigable labour of our forefathers, in bringing this fcience to\nmaturity, and in difeoveringand diflinguifhing the particular fignifications\nand efFedts of all pofitions of the planets in thefe twelve houfes of heaven,\nthat whoever takes the pains to inform himfelf fufflciently of them will\n1 on\nOrigirral from\nm p m d \\s m id 1 1r 1 i d d a d v\nDigitized by Google\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . l6 3 \/\nnot be in want of competent grounds whereon to judge, or give rational\nanfwers to every interrogation or queftion on the common occurrences of .\n, life, or any contingent accidents or undertakings, with the confequenceS\nand fuccefs of them.\nThe firft houfe bears fignification of the life of man, and of the fta- ^\nture, colour, complexion, form, and fhape, of him who propounds a quef-\ntion; and, as all the viciffitudes of nature depend upon the periods of '\nman\u2019s life, fo all queftions are refolved by this houfe that relate to Tick- \\\nnefs, health, or long life; and alfo all accidents by which life may be en- x $ \\\ndangered or impaired; what part of one\u2019s days will be the moft happy '*\n\u2022\nand profperous; whether any abfent friend or relation be living or dead;V^ '\nor whether any journey, voyage, or fhip at fea, will be attended with fuc- w\ncefs and fafety, or meet with any accident fatal to life, or deftruCtive to\nthe fhip.--------In ftiort, all queftions relating to circumftances that\naffeCt life are to be anfwered from the firft houfe. In ftate-aftrology,\nand in eclipfes, great conjunctions, appearances of comets, and other lu\u00ad\nminous and extraordinary phenomena in the heavens, and upon the Sun\u2019s\nannual ingrefs into the equinoctial fign Aries, the firft hou'e bears figni\u00ad\nfication of the community at large, or of that ftate, empire, or kingdom,\nwhere the figure is erefcied. Of colours, the firft houfe gives a white;\nfrom which is to be underftood, that, if a planet be pofited in this houfe\nthat governs a light colour, and a queftion be propounded from any party\nrelative to a perfon, matter, or thing, where colours are concerned, and\nthis planet be the fignificator thereof, then the perfon's complexion and\nhair, or, if cattle, then their Colour, ftiall be of a white, pale, or lightifh,\nkind; and, though this may appear ridiculous and infignificant to the un-\nderftanding of fome readers, yet the faCtftands unfhaken in practice. Now,\nas every one of the twelve houfes of heaven have their fignificators, fo\nhave they alfo their co-fignificators, which have frequent operation, hnd\ntherefore ought to be confidered. A co-fignificator is a planet either\nfallen into conjunction or joined in afpeCt with the principal fignificator;\nin which cafes the planet either aflifts or oppofes in the matter under con-\nfideration; if it be joined with a benevolent planet, it imports good ;\nbut, if it happens to the contrary, it either denotes deftruCtion to the fub-\njeCt of enquiry, or great difturbance in the effecting it. The co-fig\u00ad\nnificators of this houfe are Saturn and Aries; and, if Saturn is moderately\nwell dignified in this houfe, and in any benevolent afpect with Jupiter,\nVenus, or the Sun or Moon, it promifes a good fober conftitution <\/f body,\nand generally gives long life. If Mercury is lord of this houfe, and well\ndignified, the perfon Avail be a powerful and good fpeaker.\nNo. 8.

In fuits of\nJaw or equity, it (hews a man\u2019s friends or afliftants; in private duels, it\ndefcribes the querent\u2019s fecond; in eclipfes, it fhews the growing profpe\u00ad\nrity or adverfity of a ftate or people; and, at the Sun\u2019s entrance into Aries,\nit exprefles the ftrength of the empire where the figure is ereCted, in its\ninternal refources, in its allies, and in all other requifites of war, or felf-\ndefence. It gives a green colour, of which a fimilar ufe is to be made\nas is defcribed in the firft houfe; and the fame obfervation will hold\ngood in all other houfes, and in queftions that relate to colours. The\nco-fignificators to the fecond houfe are Jupiter and Taurus; for, if Jupiter\nbe placed in this houfe, or is lord thereof in full dignity, it implies the\nacquifition of an eftate or fortune; but the Sun and Mars never promife\ngood in this houfe; either of them indicate difperfion of fubftance, ac\u00ad\ncording to the capacity and quality of him who propofes the queftion.\nThe third houfe having fignification of brethren, filters, kindred, and\nneighbours; and of all inland journeys, and of removing one\u2019s manu\u00ad\nfacture or bufinefs from one pi >ce to another; fo all queftions that are\nfounded upon any fubjeCts relative thereto are anfwered from the pla\u00ad\nnets fituated in this houfe. Its co-fignificators are Mars and Gemini;\nwhich is one reafon why Mars, unlefs joined with Saturn, is not found\nfo generally unbenevolent in this houfe as in the others. If the Moon\nbe pofited here, it is always an argument to the querift of much reftlefT-\nnefs, travelling, and change of fituation. This is a fuccedent houfe, and\ngives a yellow, red, or forrel, colour.\nFrom the fourth houfe we refolve all queftions in any way relating to\nor concerning the father of the querift. Alfo all enquiries relating to\nlands, houfes, oreftates; or to towns, cities, caftles, or intrenchments,\nbefieged; of treafures hidden in the ground, and all other queftions re\u00ad\nlating to the earth; are anfwered out of this houfe, which is called the\nmum cceli, or the angle of the earth. Its co-fignificators are the Sun and\nCancer; and therefore, if the Sun be pofited in this houfe, it denotes the\nfather o f the querift to be of a generous and noble difpofition. It go\u00ad\nverns the red colour.\nBy the fifth houfe we form all our predictions relative to children, and\nto women in the ftate of pregnancy; alfo, all queftions concerning the\nprefent health of abfent fons or daughters, or the future health of thofe\nat home;, enquiries relating to the real and perfonal effects of one\u2019s fa-\n1 ther,.\nDigitized by Google Original from\nMDWU v n o k ' Dl ID I Ir I ID D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y 16f\nther, or concerning the fuccefs of meffengers, ambaffadors, or plenipo\u00ad\ntentiaries; or refpe&ing the ammunition or internal ftrength of a place\nbefieged; are all anfwered from this houfe. Its co-fignificators are Ve\u00ad\nnus and Leo, and therefore unfortunate when occupied either by Saturn\nor Mars, both of which indicate bafe and untoward children to the en\u00ad\nquirer, It indicates a mixed black and white or fanguine colour.\nThe fixth houfe refolves all queftions that in any refjpeCt appertain to\nfervants or cattle. All\u2019\no enquiries concerning the ftate of a lick per-\nfon, whether curable or not; the nature of the difeafe, and whether of\nfhort or long duration; particulars relating to uncles and aunts, and all\nkindred on the father\u2019s fide; alfo concerning one\u2019s tenants, ftewards,\nor the like; are refolved by the difpofition of the ftars and planets fituated\nin this houfe. Its co-fignificators are Mercury and Virgo; and, when\nMars and Jupiter are found in conjunction here, it is a ftrong argument\nof a good phyfician, whenever it comes up upon a queftion propounded\nin behalf of a patient who is vifited by a gentleman of the faculty. This\nhoufe, having no afpeCt with the afeendant, is always deemed unfortu\u00ad\nnate. It gives a black or dark colour.\nBy the feventh houfe, we are enabled to refolve all queftions on love-\naffairs and marriage, and to deferibe the perfon of either the man or\nwoman that the querift will be joined with in marriage. It likewife\nanfwers all enquiries of the defendant in law-fuits and litigations; or\nconcerning our public enemies in time of war. In thefts, it enables us\nto deferibe the perfon of the robber, by his fhape, ftature, complexion,\nand condition of life. In an annual ingrefs, it ufually indicates whether\npeace or war may be expended; and, prior to an engagement, betokens\nwhich fide fhall prove victorious; it difeovers fugitives, out-lawed men,\nand offenders efcaped from juftice. The co-fignificators to this houfe\nare the Moon and Libra;, and, when Saturn or Mars are found herein, it\nis deemed an unfavourable omen, productive of great forrow and wretch-\nednefs to the querift in any matrimonial engagement.

Jupiter and Sagittarius are its co-fignificators; for, if Jupiter be\npofited herein, it naturally indicates a man of religious and exemplary\nmanners, and of modeft carriage and behaviour; but, if Saturn, Mars,\nor the Dragon\u2019s Tail, are found herein, it indicates a perfon of atheiftical\nand irreligious principles; inftances of which, from the nativities of ma\u00ad\nny unhappy men of this caft, are almoft innumerable. The colours be\u00ad\ntokened by this houfe are green and white.\nThe tenth houfe, being the medium coeli, or moft elevated part of the\nwhole heavens, refolves all queftions concerning kings, princes, dukes,\nearls, marquifles, and all noblemen; judges, principal officers of ftate,\ncommanders in chief, all orders of magiftrates, and other perfons in\npower and authority. Enquiries after preferment, honours, dignity, of\u00ad\nfices, places, penfions, or finecures; or concerning the ftate of king\u00ad\ndoms, empires, provinces, commonwealths, counties, cities, or focic-\nties of men; are all refdved from the midheaven. The co-fignificators\nof this houfe are Capricorn and Mars; and, whenever Jupiter or the\nSun are polited herein, it gives the ftrongeft prefumptions of fuccefs in\nwhatever purfuits the querift may be engaged. But, if Saturn or the\nDragon\u2019s Tail afflict the fignificators in this houfe, it denies honour,\nfuccefs, or preferment, to perfons of quality or eminence; and to com\u00ad\nmon people it denotes vexation and difappointment in the common\nfunctions of their occupation or employment.

But I cannot dilinil\u2019s this\nfubjedt, without giving my readers the definition of the twelve houfes of\nheaven, from the works of the learned and much-efteemed philofoph-r and\naftrologian, Morinus; and in doing this, I fhall adhere as much to the\nlpirit and letter of the author, as the nature of a tranflation will admit.\n** It is a fad!, fays this excellent author, which preponderates in the ba\u00ad\nlance of reafon, and highly claims our fober confideration, that the life of\nman is refolvable into four diftindt periods or ages; namely, infancy,\nyouth, maturity, and old age; though it may be laid with ftridt truth,\nthat fcarcely half the human race attain to the conclufion of only their third\nperiod. In the conftrudtion of man therefore, we difeover four affedtions,\ninto which all other things appear to be reducible, as it were to. their firft\nbeginning; namely, life, adtion, marriage, and paffion. Thefe agree with\nthe rife, perfedtion, declination, and termination, of all things, and com-\nprife the whole effedts and operations of nature. For man is truly faid.\nto rife into the world the moment he receives refpiration and life; to be\nin perfedtion when he attains to manhood and maturity, and to the pro\u00ad\npagation of his fpecies; to decline, when he begins to lofe the innate\nradical principle of heat and moillure; and to fultain the laft paffion of\nlife, when he ceafes to breathe, and filently finks into the grave. The\nlife, adtion, marriage, and paffions, of men, are therefore governed by the\nfame celeftial principle, which regulates the birth, perfection, declina\u00ad\ntion, and diffolution, of all other things. Wherefore life, in the fyftem\nof nature, is regulated by the eaft angle of the heavens, called the afeen-\ndant ; adtion, by the l'outh angle, or midheaven; marriage, by the weft\nangle; and paffion, by the north angle of the heavenly frame. And hence\nNo. 8.

The firft triplicity is of the eaftern an\u00ad\ngle, or afcendant, attributed to infancy, and called the triplicity of life,\nand includes the firft, ninth, and fifth, houfes, which behold each other\nin a partile trine in the equator, where this rational divifion of the twelve\nhoufes is made.\n\u201c Man either does, or ought to, live in a three-fold refped, in himfelf,\nin God, and in his pofterity; for the great ends for which he was created,\nare to worfhip and glorify his Maker, and to propagate his fpecies. The life\nof man in himfelf is therefore the firft and prime objedl in the order of\nnature; for, without this, all other parts of the creation would be vain,\nbeing made for man su f e a n d benefit. For this caufe, thelife of man ap\npertains to the firft and principal houfe in the divifion of the heavens.\nBut man\u2019s life in God, confiftingnn his image of the Divinity, in the ra\u00ad\ntionality of his foul, and in the purity of his morals, claims, for this rea-\nfon, the ninth houfe, according to the motion of the equator, which is\nthe houfe of piety and religion. And as man\u2019s life is continued in his\npofterity, according to one and the fame unchangeable law prefiding over\nall nature, fo the houfe of infancy and children, which is the fifth houfe,\nis appropriated for this purpofe. And thefe three concerns being con-\nfefifediy the grand objc\u00a3t of man\u2019s life, the three houfes of heaven, under\nwhich they are refpedtively nourifhed and foftered, form a trine with each\nother, in a chain of mutual harmony and concord.\n\u201c The fecond triplicity confifts of the angle of the midheaven with\nthe fixth and fecond houfes. This triplicity wholly appertains to the\nfecond ftage of man\u2019s life, namely, that of vigour and adtion; and there\u00ad\nfore comprehends all worldly attainments, with the advantages flowing\nfrom them; for every thing that worketh phyfically worketh for fome\nphyfical good; and, as the motion of the equator is from the eaft angle to\nthe midheaven, fo is the progrefs made in all our earthly acquifitions.\nThe higheft degree of man\u2019s elevation in this world, is to that of majefty,\npower, honour, dignity, preferment, or magiftracy, or to any of thofe fi-\ntuations by which he acquires fuperiority and affluence. Thefe confid\u00ad\ning of immaterial matter, and forming the firft order of earthly dignity,\nclaim the angular houfe of this triplicity, or the midheaven. The fe\u00ad\ncond degree of worldly honour, is conceived to arife from fubjeds, fer-\nvants, tenants, vaflals, and domeftics; and thefe, being formed of mat\u00ad\nter material and animated, are placed under the fixth houfe. The third\nadvancement to earthly grandeur, is by matter material and animate, fuch\nas gold, jewels, and other valuable effeds, accumulated by induftry and\nfweat oj the brow',which being under the fecond houfe, thefe thteehoufes\n2 are\nDigitized by Google Original from\nmcu\/ v n D iim ir IIODADV\n\f^\ni\nf\ni\nn\no\nR\n-\nn\nd\n-\nw\n-\n\u00bb\nc\n;\nn\ni\nm\nc\nt\nn\nn\nn\ni\ni\np\ni\nr\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n\/\/:\nr\nl-\nn\ni\ni\n\/\nn\na\n7\nn\ni\nf\ni\ni\nn\n-\na\ni\nf\nS\nn\nn\no\n'i\ni\ni\np\ni\nn\nn\nn\nOF A S T R O L O G Y . 169\nare alfo joined by fympathy in a partile trine, applying to each other in\nconcord and unanimity.\n\u201c The third triplicity comprehends worldly connections, whether by\nmarriage, confanguinity, or friendlhip, and thefe holding on in the or\u00ad\nder of nature, even as the progrefs is made from tht: miuheaven to the\nweftern angle, apply to the progrellive tendency of youth to manhood and\nmaturity. In this ftage of life, man is joined in a three-fold tie or obli\u00ad\ngation; in body, in blood, and in friendlhip. Firft, he is joined in body,\nby the mod facred of all earthly ties, matrimony; lanTioned under the\nfeal of God\u2019s primary command, \u201c and multiply.\u201d Secondly, he\nis joined in confanguinity, not only by the propagation of his like, but\nby all orders of his kindred in blood. Thirdly, he is joined in friend-\nfhip under that facred bond of benevolence and love, which the Almighty\ncommands every man to exercife towards his neighbour. This is the\nvery cement of fociety, and medicine of life, performing thofegood offi\u00ad\nces in civil life which the tree of life promifed in our more perfedt ftate;\nand thefe are the lentiments of fricndfhip which alone can give a true\nrelilh to every enjoyment of this world. The mod: important of thefe\nobligations, being marriage, is for that reafon placed under fandtion of the\nangular or fuperior houle; the fecond tie, being that of blood, claims the\ngovernment of the third houfe; and the eleventh houfe, which perfedls\nthis triplicity, is facred to friendfhip. Thefe three boufes, from an\nunion of nature, behold each other in a partile trine, according to the mo\u00ad\ntion of the equator.\n\u201c The fourth and laft triplicity is that of paffion, which comprehends\nthe three dalles of human afflictions. The firft or angular houfe of this\ntriplicity, in alluiion to its polition in the lower horizon, is termed the\ndark angle, the depth of night, and bottom of heaven; the den and cave\nof the liars and planets. To this houfe is committed the firft order of our\nwoes, agreeable to the courfe of nature. Thefe are, infupportable mif-\nfortunes, and vifible decline of life; the firft conlequences of original\nfin, by which man is devoted to corruption and decay, and to all the infir\u00ad\nmities of nature. The fecond order of human afflictions, is tribulation,\nforrow, and difeafe; arifing either from the treachery and perfecution of\nenemies, from the chains of fervitude and bondage, or from poverty and\nwant. Thefe, with a long train of confequent miferies, are appropriated to\nthe twelfth houfe. The laft Ihock that can be fuftained by human na\u00ad\nture, is death, the final end of all men. This is under government of\nthe eighth houfe, termed, on this account, the houfe of death. And thefe\nhoules likewife, from the conformity of their nature and qualities, con-\nflitutc a partile trine in the equator.\n\u201c Thus\nDigitized by Go^ sle Original from\nM P u r v n u t ' di i m 1r 1 i q d a d v\n\fl;\u00ae A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n\u201c Thus the termination of this temporal life is the beginning of life\neternal. For nature knows no annihilation. All the works of Omnipo\u00ad\ntence are refolvable or changeable from one ftate to another; but God,\nhaving created nothing in vain, fuffers nothing to he annulled. Where\u00ad\nfore according to the fecon'd motion of the planets, which is from weft to\neaft, an entrance is made out of the eighth into the ninth houft* which\nis the houfe of life in God, wherein man is taught by the revelation of\nthe SUPREM E W ILL, that he fhall pals, by the fecond motion of the\nfoul, which is attributed to the mind or reafon, as the firft or wrapt foul\nor fenfitive appetite is to the body, from this life of anxiety and peril,\nto an eternal life of peace and reft. And therefore, whatever is firft in\ndignity in the order of nature, poffelfes the firft; andmore'noble heufes in\nthefe triplicities, in regular fubordination, according to the motion of\nthe ecliptic and planets.\n\u201c And now, w h a t m a n i s h e , who, confiding in the ftrength of his\nown wifdom, will dare to meafure the works of his CREATOR by the\nftandard of his own comprchenfion ? or will venture to affirm, that thefe\noperations and divifions of the .twelve celeftial houfes, conjoined with\nfuch wonderful harmony, contrivance, and concord, are the efFeds of\nchance oraccident? or that will fay, fuch admirable confents, fo excellently\nformed, and mutually dependent on each other, are cafually found in\nthings fo complicated and abftrufe? If he obftinately perfifts that thefe\nare altogether fidlious, let him point out the thing wanting to complete\nthe evidence in fupport of the natural foundation and excellency of them ?\nBut he can do neither; and therefore, as this divifion of the heavens is\nfounded in reafon, and obvioufly contrived by lupernatural wifdom and\nprefcicncc, it comprehends genethliacally all things that in the courfe of\nnature can poffibly be enquired of or concerning the works of man.\nFor as much as the knowledge of contrarieties is univerfally the fame, fo\nan affirmative, or a negative, may be fought out, and found to be comprifed\nin the twelve houfes of the Zodiac, anfwering to the divifion.\u201d\nDIRECTIONS\nDigitized by Google Origiral from\nm e u \/ v n d v di i m i r i i r r a r v\n\fu\nu\ni\ni\ni\nd\ni\ni\ni\n,\nu\nu\nu\ny\ni\ne\n-\nu\ni\ny\ni\nu\n^\ne\nu\n\/\nnii|j;\/\/vvvvvv.iidu\nmu\nu^\ni.\nu\niy\n\/d\ncc\nt\n;\n5b\n_\nu\nb\ne-\n\/y\n-\np\nu\n-\ny\nu\nu\ny\nit;\nO F A S T R O L O G Y . 171\nD IRECTIO N S for eredting the FIG URE of HEAV EN, and placing\nthe PLA N ETS in the HOROSCOPE.\nW\nIT H O U T being expert at finding the true places of the planets\nand liars, at any hour or minute required, either by day or night\nand without knowing how to difpofe them in the horofcope, fo as to re-\nprefent their exadt fituations in the heavens; nothing can pofiibly be\nknown or predicted by Aftrology. This acquifition, therefore, is the\nnext Rep to be attained ; and, though it may at firR appear a talk of fome\ndifficulty and labour, yet by the help of a common Ephemeris, which is\npublifhed annually, and the following tables, which are calculated and\nSubjoined for this purpofe, the reader may in a few hours become perfedt\nmailer of this very efiential part of the fcience.\nThe Ephemeris, of which Mr. W hite\u2019s is the beft, is calculated to\n(hew the exadl places of the Sun, Moon, and planets, every day at twelve\no\u2019clock; confequcntly, by referring to it, a figure may be accurately fet\nto that exadt time. But it may feldom or never happen, that a figure is\nwanted precifely at that hour, and therefore it is neceifary the young prac\u00ad\ntitioner fhould know how to redtify the daily motions of the planets, by\nthe number of degrees they move every twenty-four hours, fo as to eretl\nthe figure, and introduce the true places of the figns and planets, when\u00ad\never required. T his, by referring to the Ephemeris for the Rations of\nthe planets at noon, may be done extremejy eafy, by the common pro-\ncefs of figures; but, that every reader may be enabled to do it without\ntrouble, I have fubjoined an eafy table, whereby the planetary motions\nare reduced to hours and minutes, and may be found for either day or\nnight.\nIt is likewife of importance to know the planetary hours, that is, the\nhour in which every planet has its particular rule; for hereby we are\nenaibled to determine various points, and to draw many ufeful conclu-\nfions, either in our judgment on nativities or horary queftions. In ga\u00ad\nthering herbs for medicinal purpofes, the planetary hour is certainly\nof confequence, however modern refinement might have exploded\nthe idea. In nature, the moR fimple remedies are frequently found to\nproduce the moR falutary effedts; and in earlier times, when the art of\nphyfic was lefs obfeured, and pradtifed more from motives of benevo\u00ad\nlence, the world was lefs afflidted with difeafe, and the period of hu\u00ad\nman life lefs contracted.

Each planet begins his rule the moment the Sun\nappears above the horizon; and continues for one planetary hour, at the\nexpiration of which the next planet in order commences his rule, and con\u00ad\ntinues the fame portion of time, and then the third planet in order governs,\nand fo on through the whole week. So that, if I want to know what planet\nrules in any particular hour of the day or night, I take the planet which\nbegins rule that day, and reckon in order till I find it. For example, on\nSunday the Sun rules the firft hour, Venus the fecond, Mercury the third,\nthe Moon the fourth, Saturn the fifth, Jupiter the fixth, Mars the feventh,\nthe Sun the eighth, Venus the ninth, and fo on through the whole day\nand fucceeding night, till the Sun rifes again, by which mode of reckon\u00ad\ning it will be uniformly found, that each planet will begin his govern\u00ad\nment at Sun rifing, according to the order above defcribed, to the end\nof the world. This alfo.evidently appears by the table; for if we begin\nwith the firft column, and reckon down the whole twenty-four hours,\nwe find the Moon begins her government at the top of the fecond column\non Monday morning, when the Sun rifes. If we reckon down the fecond\ncolumn, in the fame order, we find Mars begins his rule at the top\nof the third column, on Tuefday morning. So the planets will be found\nto obferve the fame regular order throughout all the other columns,\nwhich take in the hours of every day and night throughout the week;\nand for the enfuing week the table begins again in the fame order, and\nwill fo continue without alteration or error, to the end of time.

' The many invaluable difcoveries lately added to the Pharmacopoeia, both from rhe\nvegetable and mineral worlds, are ftrong arguments of the neceflity of regular practice, and of\nprofeffional education, in forming the phylician. But were the bulk of thefe gentlemen to\nconfult a little more the planetary influences, both on vegetable and mineral fubflances, and\napportion them in their prefcriptions according to the nature and conlfitution of the patient,\nuniformly confulting the effedts of Saturn and the Moon in each crilis and critical day, 1 am\nperfuaded that more immediate relief, in mod cafes where nature is not too far exhaufted, might\nbe afforded to the fick and languifhing patient. Surgery too, which like a guardian angel itcps\nforward to alleviate the perilous accidents of the unfortunate, would gain much improvement\nby the like confiderations. It is not therefore the regular-bred practitioners of either Phyfic or\nSurgery that the author means to. arraign; but that baneful defeription of empirics and\nquacks, who now pervade the kingdom; and, like a fwarm^of locufts from the caff, prey,\nupon the vitals of mankind. Thefe mongers in the fhape of^men, with hearts callous to every\nfentiment of companion, have only fees in view. Governed by this fordid principle, they\nfport with lifer unmoved amidft the bitter anguifh and piercing groans of the defponding patient;\ntill, too far gone for human aid to reltore, they abandon him to defpair and death. For the lake\nof humanity, and thehonour of a Cnriftian country, let the legiflative pow-er check this growing\nenormity!\nand\nDigitized by Gck ale Original from\nM H \/ i \/ v n o k ' d i i n i 1\nr 1i R R\n\fi 74 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nand night throughout the week, the reader may always fee what planet\ngoverns in that hour, as its character is placed in the fame line with the\nfigure. For example, fuppofe I want to know what planet rules the\nfifth hour on Sunday morning; I look down the firft column of the\ntable, over which is placed Sunday planetary hour, and at the 5th hour,\nI find Saturn governs. Again, fuppofe it be required to know what pla\u00ad\nnet governs the ninth hour on Friday afternoon ? Look down the column\nover which Friday planetary hour is printed, and in the 9th hour it will\nbe fecn that Mercury governs. Or if it be afked, what planet rules the\nnineteenth hour on Wednesday night.? Look down the column over which\nWednesday planetary hour is prefixed, and at 19, which fignifies the\n19th hour, or the feventh hour after the Sun is fet, it will be found that\nMars governs; and fo for any other time required.\nBut a planetary hour not agreeing with the common divifion of time,\nand being peculiar to aftronomy and aftrology only, we fiiall explain it\nmore fully. Theplanetary hours are reckoned from the time of the\nSun\u2019s rifing to its fetting, which fpace of time is divided into twelve\nequal parts, and thefe are termed the twelve planetary hours of that day.\nThen the time from the Sun\u2019s fetting to its rifing the next morning is\nin the fame manner divided into twelve equal parts, and thefe conftitute\nthe twelve planetary hours for that night. Hence it is obvious, that,\nwhen the days are fhort, a planetary hour does not confift of above forty\nminutes, more or lefs, according to the twelfth part of the whole time\nfrom the Sun\u2019s rifing to its fetting; and, the nights being then long, a\nplanetary hour by night may conlift of an hour and ten or twenty minutes,\nor more; and fo \u2022viceverfa, when the days are long, and the nights ihort;\nfo that the duration of planetary hours, both by day and night, are con\u00ad\ntinually varying, and never agree with the common meafure of time,\nexcept on thofe two days in every year when the Sun enters Aries and\nLibra,'and then equal night and day is difpenfed to all parts of the world.\nTherefore, to enable the reader to find the length of the planetary hours\nwithout the trouble of calculating, I fubjoin the following table, by\nwhich they may be found, both night and day, for ever.\nTABLE\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM C U \/ V f l D F D I I P I i r I I D R A D V\n\fO P A S T R O L O G Y . 175\nT A B L E o f the P L A N E T A R Y H O U R S for every D a y and\nN i g h t intheW\neek.\nLength of the\nDay.\nLength of the Plane\u00ad\ntary Hours by Day.\nLength of the Plane- 1\ntary Hours by Night. 1\nH.

For example, fuppofe a planet moves one degree in twenty-four\nhours, how far does it move in one hour ? At the top of the firft column\nis the figure 1, and in the fame line of the fecond column is 2 minutes\nand 30 feconds; which (hews, that, if a planet be twenty-four hours in\nmoving one degree, it then moves at the rate of two minutes and 30\nfeconds in an hour. Or fuppofe a planet only moves two minutes in\ntwenty-four hours ; look into the firft column of the table f the figure 2,\noppolite, in the fecond column, (land 5 feconds, which fhews that, if a\nplanet moves two minutes in twenty-four hours, it then only moves five\nfeconds in an hour. Again, if a planet\u2019s diurnal motion be thirteen mi\u00ad\nnutes, what is its hourly motion? Look into the firft column for 13,\nand oppofiteis32, 30; which indicates, that, if a planet moves thirteen\nminutes in twenty-four hours, it moves thirty-two feconds and thirty\nthirds in an hour. The fame rules hold good for the motions of all the\nplanets ; it muft however be carefully obferved, that, if the diurnal mo\u00ad\ntion of any planet be in degrees, then you muft enter the firft column of\nthe table under the denomination of degrees, and the fecond column\nwith minutes and feconds; but, if the diurnal motion of the planet be\nonly in minutes, then you muft\u00bbbegin to reckon in the firft column only\nwith minutes and in the fecond column with feconds and thirds.\nThis is indicated by the initial letters placed over each column, which\nfignify degrees or minutes in the firft column, and, in the fecond,degrees\nand minutes, minutes and feconds, feconds and thirds. Then fuppofea\nplanet moves one degree and thirteen minutes in twenty-four hours, how\nfar does it move in an hour ? Refer to the table, and fay.\nOne degree in 24 hours is 2 min. 30 fee. o thirds per hour.\nThirteen min. in 24 hours is o min. 32 fee. 30 thirds.\nAnfwer 3 2 30\nAnd thus any quantity of a planet\u2019s diurnal motion may be reduced to\ntime in the fame manner.\nBut as no figure can be eredted without the help of an Ephemeris, and\ntables to {hew the Sun\u2019s place in each of the twelve figns, unlcfs by en\u00ad\ntering into long and tedious calculations, I fhall therefore infert in this\nplace the two pages of W hite\u2019s Ephemeris for June 1784, and the tables\nabove-mentioned, with an explanation of the whole*\n(CO -\nDigitized by Goc gle Original from\nM m * \/ v n o t ' D i i m 1r 1 i b b a b v\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n178\n( C O P Y.)\nW H I T E \u2019 S E P H E M E R I S , for June 1784.\n__________ T u n e hath X X X D a y s.\nT h e L u N A T i o N s .\nF u ll m oon the 3d day, a t 34 m inutes p aft 4 aftern o o n .\nL a ft q u arter the 10th d ay , at 28 m inutes paft 8 m o rn in g .\nN e w m oon the 17th day, a t 6 m inutes paft 6 evening.\nF irft q u arter the 23th day, a t 33 m inutes paft 10 a t n ig h t.\nM .

But, fince no information can be obtained in the\npractical part of this Science without them, it is proper to caution all my\nreaders againft this much mistaken notion j for every perfon who can make\nufe of a Ready R\ne\nc\nk\no\nn\ne\nr\n, or Trader's Sure Guide, may with equal eafe un\u00ad\nderstand all the tables calculated for this work.\nThe ufe of the Ephemeris, in Setting a figure, is to point out the places\nof the planets at noon, whenever required. For this purpofe, we refer\nto the given day of the month, in the firft column of the right-hand page,\nand oppofite to it, in the Second column, is the Sun\u2019s place or longitude\nthat day at noon. So alfo, in the fame line of the Succeeding columns\nthrough the whole table, are the places of the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter,\nMars, Venus, and Mercury, as Specified at the top of each diftintt co\u00ad\nlumn j and thefe are the true places of the Sun, Moon, and planets,\nevery day throughout the year, precifely at twelve o\u2019clock at noon.\nTherefore, if the figure be erected before that time, the diurnal motion\nof the planets muft be deducted in hours and minutes, in proportion to\nthe rate they move at per hour; but, if it be eredted after noon, then So\nmany, hours or minutes mull be added as will bring them to the precife\ntime of eredting the figure.\nThe twelve tables of Houfes are next to be referred to ; and thefe are\ncalculated to fhew what degrees of each fign polfefs the cufps of the\ntwelve houfes of heaven when the figure is eretied. They begin with\nthe Sun\u2019s entrance into the fign Aries, and Shew his progrefs through\neach degree of the twelve Signs of the zodiac.\n. Now let it be required, by way of example, to eredt a figure for F ri\u00ad\nday, the 11th day of June, 1784, at 11 h. 24 min. A. M. that is, at\ntwenty-four minutes pad eleven o\u2019clock in the morning. To do this, I\nrefer to the firft column of the right-hand page of the Ephemeris for\nJune, and oppofite the n th day of the month, in the fecond column,\nwhich has o 's longitude printed at the top, I find 21. 3. 27, with the\nfign n prefixed at the fide of the firft range of figures. This indicates,\nthat the Sun, at twelve o\u2019clock that day, is in twenty-one degrees three\nminutes and twepty-feven fecond6 of Gem ini; but the nnnutes^ apd\nfeconds, when lelj than thirty, a^e rejected without fenfible error, and,\nwhen more than thirty, have as many added as wift make them up even\ndegrees. I therefore turn to the table of houfes, and in the page enti\u00ad\ntled Sol in Gemini I look for the column that has the fign n at the\ntop, which is the third ; I feek for 21 degrees, and in the column on\nJt* rf \/'*\u00bb**> ldl-,h\n<\n!\nGoogle Origirkal from\nM E I A \/ V f l D f Dl ID I I r I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S 'T .R O L O G Y. 193\nthe left fide of it, entitled Timefrom noin, I find, even with 21 degrees,\n5 h. 21 min. The hours and minutes thus found are uniformly to be\nadded to the time or hour of the day when the figure is ere&cd, un-\nlefs it be precifely at noon, in which cafe, as we have before obferved,\nthe places of the Sun, planets, and figns, are to be fet down exactly as\nthey are found in the.Ephemeris, and tables of houfes. But, the pre-\nfent figure being erected juft thirty-fix minutes before twelve o\u2019clock, I\nam to add this time, reckoning from noon the preceding day, to the\nabove 5 h. 21 min. and from thefe two fums added together I fubtradfc\n^\u25a0twenty-four hours, and the remainder will give the degrees of each of the\ntwelve figns, as then pofited upon the cufps of the horofeope; thus:\nTime anfwering to 21 degrees of n\nTime from noon the preceding day\nAdded together, make\nSubtract\nRemainder\nh. min.\n5 21\n*3 24\n28 45\n24 0\n4 45\nI feek this remainder in the tablesof houfes^entitled \u00a3q1 in Gemini, in\nthe column of T\nim\nejro\nmnoon-, but, not finding 4. 45, I take the neareft\nnumber to it, which is 4. 46; and oppofite this number, in the next\ncolumn on the right, I find 13 degrees of Gemini in the tenth houfe,.\nwhich is denoted by 10th houfe n , at the top of the column; and there\u00ad\nfore I place thirteen degrees of Gemini in the line or cufp of the tenth\nhoufe of the figure. This done, I refer to the next column in rotation\nto the right hand, and in the fame line with the twenty-one degrees of J\nGemini I find 20. 7, and, looking to the top of the column, find it to\nbe twenty degrees and feven minutes of the fign 25, with 11 houfe over,\nand therefore I place twenty degrees feven minutes of Cancer upon the\ncufp of the eleventh houfe. I follow the fame rule with the next co-\nlumn, where I find 21. aB, and looking to the top find the fign &, 12\nhoufe, and accordingly place twenty-one degrees thirty-eight minutes\nof Leo upon the cuip of the twelfth houfe in the figure. Then I refer\nto the next column, where I find 17. 1, and at the top the word Afcen-'\ndantwith the fign \u00bb\nR prefixed, which fignifies that feventeen degrees one\nminute of Virgo occupy the firft houfe or Afcendant, which I place ac\u00ab-\ncordingly. I then refer to the next column, and even with the preced\u00ad\ning figures ftand 9. 15, when, looking up the column, I obferve the\nfign ^ below \"R, and 2 houfe at the top, which ihews that nine degrees\nfifteen minutes of Libra are to be placed on the cufp of the fecond houfe.\nThis done, I refer to the laft: column, and even with the former num-\n2 bers\nDigitized by Gck>sle Original from\nMC\\A\/ v n e k ' Dl ID I Ir I I Q B A P V\n\f194 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\n* bers I find 7 .4 8 ; and, looking up the column as before, Iobfervethe\nfign below \u00aba=\n, and 3 houfe over, which indicates that feven degrees\nforty-eight minutes of Scorpio are to be placed on the cufp of the third\nhoufe. Thus the fix oriental houfes, namely, the tenth, eleventh, twelfth,\nfirft, fecond, and third, arefurnifhed with the degrees of each fign then\nrifing upon them ; and the fix occidental houfes, being oppofite to the\nformer, are always furnifhed with the fame degrees and minutes-of the\noppofite figns; th u s:\nHoufes oppofite.

For example, in the prefent figure, we have placed\n13 degrees of n on the cufp of the tenth houfe j now t being oppofite\nto n , and the fourth houfe to the tenth, I therefore place 13 degrees of\nt on the cufp of the fourth houfe. Upon the cufp of the eleventh\nhoufe, 20 degrees 7 minutes of Cancer being already placed, and the\nfifth houfe being oppofite to the eleventh, and oppofite 2s, I there\u00ad\nfore put 20 degrees 7 minutes of kupon the cuf\nThe cufp of the twelfth houfe being alfo occupied with 21 degrees 38\n* minutes of Si,I place 21 degrees 38 minutes of the oppofite fign &\nupon the cufp of the fixth houfe, which is oppofite the twelfth. Upon\nthe cufp of the firft houfe, orafeendant, their is 17 degrees 1 minute of\nand the feventh houfe being oppofite to the firft, and the fign x to\nm , I accordingly place 17 degrees 1 minute of x upon the cufp or line\nof the feventh houfe. Having alfo placed 9 degrees 15 minutes of \u00a3=\nupon the cufp of the fecond houfe, I place 9 degrees 15 minutes of the\noppofite fign v upon the cufp of the eighth houfe, which is oppofite to\nthe fecond. I then refer to \u25a0the'third houfe, upon the cufp of which are\nplaced 7 degrees 48 minutes of i\u00bbt; and the oppofite houfe to this being\nDigitized by Gc\nkgle Original from\nm p u \/ v n R k ' D i i m i r i i d p a p v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 195\nthe ninth, and \u00ab the oppofite fign, I place 7 degrees 48 minutes of\nTaurus upon the cufp of the ninth houfe; and thus the twelve houfes\nare completely occupied with the twelve figns of the zodiac, with the\ndegrees afcending, at the precil'e time of ereding the figure.\nHaving fo far fucceeded, the next thing is to place the Sun, Moon, and\nplanets, in the figure, agreeable to their polition at that time inthe heavens,\nand this is alfo to be done by the help of the right-hand page of the Ephe-\nmeris. For inftance, I again refer to the 11 th of June, and oppofite\nto it, in the column of the o \u2019s longitude, I find him in 21 degrees 3\nminutes and 27 feconds of Gemini that day at noon. But as the figure is\nereded thirty-fix minutes before noon, I note how far the Sun has moved\nfrom noon the preceding day, and find he has gone at the rate of fifty-\nfeven minutes, which gives a difference of one minute and twenty-feven\nfeconds for the time before noon, as follows :\nSun's place at noon, June n th\nDedud for 36 min. before noon\n* min. fee.\n21 3 27\nO 1 2 7 \u2022 \u20221\n\u25a0\n9\n*\n21 2 O f\nRemains\nThus I find the Sun\u2019s place at twenty-four minutes after eleven o\u2019clock,\nin 21 degrees 2 minutes of Gemini; which fign being then upon the cufp\nof the tenth houfe, I therefore place the Sun in that houfe, clofe to the .\nfign, with thefe degrees and minutes. I then refer to the Ephemeris for \u25a0 :\nthe Moon\u2019s place, and in the column of her longitude, oppofite the 1ith \u2022\u2022 *\nday of the month, I find her in 5 degrees 46 minutes of v , at noon ; but, ; J\nto know her place thirty-fix minutes before, I note how much (he goes\nin an hour, and find her motion to be 35 minutes ; then I dedud 21 mi\u00ad\nnutes for the time before noon, and find her true place to be in 5 heur\u00bb-\n25 minutes of Aries, which I accordingly enter before the cufp of the **\neighth hoiffe clofe to that fign. I then refer to the Ephemeris for the\nplanet , and on the n th of June I find him*retrograde in 22 degrees\n53 minutes of the fign k\nf, wherefore I place him under Capricorn, in\nfifth houfe, with an R prefixed, to denote that he is retrograde.\u2014I refer\nto the Ephemeris in like manner for the planets Jupiter, Mars, Venus,\nand Mercury, which I alfo enter in their proper places in the figure, viz.\nJupiter in 7 degrees 36 minutes of K, Mars in 27 degrees 1 minute ol\nss, Venus in 5 degrees 5 minutes of n , and Mercury retrograde, in 24\ndegrees 2 minutes of the fame fign.\nThe planets being thus entered, I next refer to the top of the fecond\npage of the Ephemeris, for the column of the Moon\u2019s node, which we\nterm the Dragon\u2019s Head, and I find on the 7th day of the month it is\nNo. 10.

The mode of determining this has commonly been by\nfirft finding the true place of the Moon, then the true place of the Sun;\nthen fubtrafting the Sun\u2019s place from the Moon\u2019s, and adding to the re-\n^ mainder the degrees of the afcendant; and this, if taken in the fphere of\n\u25a0\ni\nthe Moon, gives the place of the Part of Fortune. But, a much more\n' correct method having been\u2019adopted by the learned Placidus, we recom-\nnjHC ^ mend it in preference to any other; it is as follows: Firft note the fign\n\u2018 i an<^ degree on t^ie afcendant, and enter with the fame fign and degree in\nthe table of oblique afcenfions calculated for this work, in the latitude\nwherein you ere\u00a3t your figure ; and in the common angle of meeting you\nwill find the number required. Then enter the fame table with the de\u00ad\ngree of the Sun, and fubtradt the oblique afcenfion of the one from the\nother, and the remainder will be the Sun\u2019s diftance from the J afcendant.\n, Then take the right afcenfion of the Moon, and enter the table of the\nVt Moon\u2019s right afcenfion under the degrees of north or fouth latitude, as\nthen happens to be; and, when the Moon\u2019s right afcenfion is found,\nfubtradt it from the Sun\u2019s diftance from the afcendant, and the remainder\nwill be the right afcenfion of the Part of Fortune. For example, in\n\u00bb .

The fixed ftars may be found and\ndiftinguiftied in the heavens by their conjundtions with the Moon, or by\nobferving their order from any given point in the heavens; thus begin\nwith the Pleiades, vulgarly called t h e Jiars, and next to them in\norder, but fomewhat lower, is a large red ftar called Aldebaran, or the\nfouth eye of the Bull-,next follows Or Belt or Girdle, which are three\nftars in a rank thus, ***, and are vulgarly called the Yard or Ell.\nNext follows a ftar called the Great Dog, which is a large bright ftar,\nfomewhat lower than the Girdle of Orion. The next is called the head\nof Gemini, and is about the height of the Seven Stars; there are two to\u00ad\ngether appear thus, **; the largeft of the two is the ftar here nomi\u00ad\nnated. The next, which follows in order, is called South no\ngreat ftar, but of a red colour; there are two of them, near together anej.\nalike, and ftand or appear thus, % ; the loweft of the two is the ftar\nhere meant. Next in order follows a ftar called the Head of Hydra,\nlower than Afiellus, and of-a bright white colour. Then follows a ftar\nin the flank of the Lion, very bright, and about the height of the Se\u00ad\nven Stars. Next to that the Virgin\u2019s Girdle, a bright ftar, and lower\nthan the flank of the Lion. And next follows a curious ftar called the\nVirgins Spike, very large and bright; it is a ftar of the firft mag\u00ad\nnitude, and appears a little lower or more foutherly than the Virgin\u2019s\nGirdle. Next in order follows the ftar called a very remarka\u00ad\nble bright red-coloured ftar, about the latitude of the Pleiades. Then\nfollows the ftar of the Crown, large and bright, and higher than Ardtu-\nrus. Then the Right Shoulder of Hercules, of a pale white colour, near\nthe altitude of the Seven Stars. Then follows the head of Ophincus, of\na pale-white colour, and fomewhat fouthward of Hercules. Then ap\u00ad\npears a ftar under the armpit of Sigittary, a bright ftar, but very low.\nNext, the bright ftar of the Vulture, large, and lower than the Seven Stars.\nThe next ftar is called the Left Shoulder of the ; about the\naltitude of Orion\u2019s Girdle, of a pale-white colour. The next in order is\nthe ftar called Marchab, being a ftar of a bright colour, a little lower than\nthe Seven Stars, but much bigger.

Thofe that would be curious in thefe fpeculations\nfhould fludy the celeflial globe, and learn to be very expert in the ufe of\nit, which is mod eafily attained, ,and alfo very entertaining.\nNow, to know whether any of the fixed flars fall into the figure ere<5t-\ned, I note the fign and degree upon the cufpsof thehoufes, and then exa\u00ad\nmine the fecond column of the foregoing table of fixed flars, and, if I find\neither of them afcending or defcending within five degrees of the figns\nupon the cufps of the feveral houfes, they are then to be entered in the\nfame manner as the planets, and their qualities and influences are to be\nduly weighed, according to the nature of whatever planet they corre-\nfpond with, which is fhewn in the lafl column of the table. In the fore\u00ad\ngoing figure of the heavens, I obferve feventeen degrees one minute of\nupon the afcendant; then, looking down the twelve figns in order in the\nlecond column of fixed flars, Ifind ntt 18. 32, and even with it in the firft\ncolumn, the tail of the Lion, which fhews that this flar is alfo afcend\u00ad\ning within five degrees of the culp of the firft houfe, or afcendant j and\ntherefore I place it in the firft houfe of the figure, under the fign m . I then\nexamine the other cufps according to their rotation, and, on the cufp of\nthe fourth houfe, I find t 13. o, and, in the table of fixed flars, I find\nt 14. 55, and even with it the Right Knee of Ophincus, which\nfhews that this flar is within two degrees of the cufp of the fourth\nhoule, in which I accordingly place it. On the cufp of the fixth houfe\nI fee -r 21. 38, and in the table of fixed flars I find Marchab Pegafi in\n~ 20. 25 ; I therefore place it under the fign ~ in the fixth houfe of the\nfigure. Upon the cufp of the eighth houfe in the figure is v 9. 15,\nand in the table of fixed flars I find the head of Andromeda in 11. 20,\nI therefore place it juft within the cufp of the eighth houfe. Upon the\nmedium cceli, I find n 13. o, and in the table I find the eminent fixed\nflar Rigel, of the firft magnitude, in n 13. 56, I therefore place him in\nthe mid-heaven. Upon the cufp of the eleventh Hands s> 20. 7, and\nin the table I find the flar Pollux in ss 20. 12, which I enter within the\ncufp of the eleventh houfe. Upon the cufp of the twelfth is 21. 38,\nand in the table I find the flar Hydra in si 24. 12, and therefore I enter\nhim in twenty-four degrees of Leo in the twelfth houle; and thus I have\ncollected the pofitions of all the planets and eminent fixed flars, as they\nflood in the heavens at twenty four minutes pall eleven o\u2019clock, on Fri\u00ad\nday the eleventh of June, 1784. As the fixed flars move on their lon\u00ad\ngitude at the rate of fifty feconds per year, and of courfe vary in their po-\nfition, I have for this reafon calculated a table, by which their fituation\nmay be known at any given time, pallor to come..\nTABLE\nDigitized by Go<..gle Original from\nMEIA\/ v n c b ' Dl i m IC I I D E A\n\f#\nTABLE, (hewing the Places of the F i x e d S t a r s * at any.T im e, part\nor to come.\nYears. degrees Min.

For example, fuppofe a perfon born\nin fifty-three degrees of latitude, on the firft of June, 1784, at thirty-\nfix minutes paft five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, what would be the de\u00ad\ngrees of each fign upon the cufps of the twelve houfes ? to know this,\nturn to the Ephemeris for the Sun\u2019s place on the firft of June, and it\nwill be found in eleven degrees thirty minutes of Gemini; then refer to\nthe table of houfes for the Sun in Gemini, and in the column under\nloth houfe, I look down for 11. 30, but, finding no minutes, I look into\nthe column upon the left hand under time from noon, where I find\n4 h. 38 min. the next arch of time being 4 h. 42 minutes, I divide\nthe difference for the thirty minutes, which makes the true time 4 h. 40\nmin. To this I add 5 h. 36 min, the time after noon, which added to\u00ad\ngether make 10 h. 16 min. which I feek in the column of time from\nnoon and in the next column on the right hand I find the figure 2,\nwith 10 houfe ne at the top, which denotes that two degrees of Virgo\nare at that time upon the cufp of the tenth houfe. Then, in order'to\nknow what figns poffefs the other houfes, I look into the firft column of\nthe table, with A.

J\n22\nV, 2 1 2 9\nIn this plain, eafy, and obvious, manner, may the fituation of the\nheavens be found for any latitude whatever. But, to make it more eafy,\nit is neceffary to explain what we mean by the poles pofitions, and the\nequations of time. If we imagine twelve great circles, one of which is\nthe meridian of any given place, to interfefct each other in the two poles\nof the earth, and to cut the equator in every fifteenth degree, they will be\ndivided by the poles into twenty-four femicircles, which divide the equator\ninto twenty-four equal parts j and as the earth turns on its axis, the planes\nof thefe femicircles come fucceflively after one another every hour to the\nfun. And, as in an hour of time there is a revolution of fifteen degrees\nof the equator, in a minute of time there will be a revolution of fifteen\nminutes of the equator, and in a fecond of time a revolution of fifteen\nfeconds. Thus, to every pi,ice fifteen degrees eaftward from any given\nmeridian, it is noon an hour fooner than on that meridian, becaufe their\nmeridian comes to the Sun an hour fooner. And to all places fifteen de\u00ad\ngrees weftward, it is hour later, becaufe their meridian comes an hour\nlater to the Sun j and fo on, every fifteen degrees of motion caufing an\nhour\u2019s difference of time. Therefore they, who have noon an hour later\nthan we, have their meridian, that is, their longitude, fifteen degrees\nweftward from u s; and they, who have noon an hour fooner than we,\nhave their meridian or longitude fifteen degrees eaftward from ours ; and\nfo, for every hour\u2019s difference of time, fifteen degrees difference of longi\u00ad\ntude. And, as we fhall have frequent occafion to equate the motions of\nthe equator with the hours and minutes of time, I here fubjoin two tables\nfor that purpofe.\nTABLES\nDigitized by ( j O O S j l C\nOriginal from\nMCVAf v n c Y Dl ID I IT I I D D A D V\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nTABLES for converting mean folar Time into Degrees and Parts of the\nterreftial Equator j and alfo for converting Degrees and Parts of the\nEquator into folar Time._______________________________ _\nT a b l e I.

T hey alfo frequently prove to he very fraudulent, covetous,\nand fufpicious, lcldom forgetting or forgiving injuries ; often forrowful\nand low-fpirited; loving no man\u2019s efteem but their own ; for the mod\npart prudent and careful, but auftere and furly in their manners and de--\nportment.\nWatery figns make them cowardly, luxurious, wanton, mutable, dull,\nand fluggifli; with low, effeminate, whining voices, very timorous and\nfearful, having much deceit in them. They are ufually pretty much-\ngiven to the fehools and nurferies of Venus, which often prove a great\ninjury to them, and fometimes their total ruin.\nIt muft alfo be remembered, that Saturn is extremely cold and dry;'\nJupiter is remifsly hot and moift, Mars extremely hot and dry, the Sun\nis meanly hot and dry, Venus is hot and moift. Mercury is remifsly cold\nand dry, the Moon is meanly cold and moift. If Saturn be in Aries, his\nd-rinefs is increased, and his coldnefs abated, or he is intenfely dry, or re-\nnaiisly cold; InTaurus he adis with a double force, viz. he is intenfely\ncold and dry ; in Gemini he is remifsly cold and dry, in Cancer he is in\u00ad\ntenfely cold , fo that if Saturn afpedl the afeendant from any of thefe\nfigns, he varies -his influence, according to the fign he is in. A planet in 1\nhis houfe, as the Sun in Leo, retains his own nature, and is well affedied '\nin his influence, but if in his detriment, as in Aquaries, he is then ill\naffedled or deprived. If he be only peregrine, he is meanly affedted as to\ngood or evil, viz. neither effentially ftrong nor weak; if in his fall, he\nflags in his motion, and is a man indifpoled and uneafy. Therefore a\nplanet in his fall or detriment effedls no good to the native, if any, it is\ncepraved, and confequcntly dangerous or pernicious.\nNo. 14. 3 S A pla-\nOriginal from\nm c u \/ v n e v d i i d 1 1r 1 i d d a d v\nDigitized by Google\n\f*72 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nA planet direct and fwift in motion, or on the contrary, is as thofe very\nterms import; therefore their celerity, orientality, and their pofition, if .\nfuperiors, fupra terram, makes them more manifeflrand powerful. Aries\nalcending gives a martial wit and inclination, but, if the Sun be in par-\ntile, trine, or fextile, to it, or its lord, or in conjunction of Jupiter, who\nmay be in platic fextile or trine to either of them, then it is made folar\nand jovial, but chiefly folar. Underftand the like in other figns afcend-\ning, according to their refpeCtive nature, aad the nature alfo of thofe pla-\nnets that behold them.\nThe .nature and ftate of every planet mult be attended to ; for a pla\u00ad\nnet may be confidered in relation to the portents or fignification of any\nfign or manfion of heaven ; thus, Firft as to pofition j fecond, dominion ;\nthird, exaltation ; fourth, afpedt; fifth, oppofition thereunto; as for ex\u00ad\nample, Saturn in Aries mufl be confidered as Martialized and Solalized,\nbecaufe Aries is the houfe of Mars, aad the exaltation and triplicity of\nthe Sun, and fo in others. The afeendant in any nativity is to be ob-\nferved, alfo the lord of the afeendant and his pofition, or a planet pofited\ntherein j all which arc to be confidered by the reader or ftudent as to the\nportents or fignification of the afeendant. The fixth houfe fignifies dil-\ncafes, but yet the twelfth fhall be a configurator in all corporal afflic\u00ad\ntions, as being in oppofition thereto.\nFrom the lord of the afeendant, or in any other houfe, proceeds the chief\nvirtue or mod powerful parts as to the fignification of that houfe; if Sa\u00ad\nturn and the Sun be in conjundtion in Leo in the tenth houfe, the latter\nbeing neareft to the cufp thereof, then the native arrives to fome degree\nof dignity or honour from the analogy, pofition, dominion, or fortitude,\nof the Sun, as ^fo his propinquity to the cufp. But Saturn being of a\ncontrary nature, and adverfe to what the Sun portends, alfo hating the\nplace of his refidence, and partly afflidting the Sun, will therefore caufe\nfome unhappy misfortune to arife, and cloud the glory promifed by the\nSun in the end. Saturn in conjunction with Jupiter in Virgo is mod\npowerful, and overcomes in his effedts; but, if they are conjoined in\nAries, then Jupiter is ftrongeft, and becomes vidtor. This reciprocally\nby each being in his fall.\nThe luminaries are to be confidered as more powerful and fignificant\nthan the reft of the planets; and therefore any of the fuperiors in conjunc\u00ad\ntion with the Sun in Leo influences much power and honour to the na\u00ad\ntive by virtue of the Sun, &c. So if Saturn be in conjundtion with Ju\u00ad\npiter in Sagittary, the houfe of Jupiter, then Saturn adts in dependance\nto his difpoiitor.

A\nmalefic planet, weak in the tenth houfe, denies honour, if they behold\neither the cufp or the lord thereof by any malevolent afpedt ; then many\nimpediments or obftru&ions prejudice or hinder the native\u2019s advancement.\nMars in the mid-heaven, ftrong, ufually portends military preferment,\ndignity, or profefllon.\nSaturn or Mars, ftrong in a good houfe of a figure, are as difeords in\nmufic, corredted to effedt a concord or harmony in founds; for, being\nwell affedted, they caufea perfedt good, though it be attended with dif\u00ad\nficult means or methods to accompany it. In fine, their good is always\ntempered with fomething of evil, becaufe they arc naturally more propenfe\nto effedt evil than good as for example, Saturn in the fecond houfe, or\nlord thereof, and ftrong, gives riches by rapine and covetoufnefs; in the\nfeventh he denotes the death of the wife. A malefic planet meanly af\u00ad\nfedted in a good houfe oftentimes obftrudts or prevents what is naturally\nfignified thereby, or at beft but meanly effedts a good. As for example,\nSaturn meanly affedted, viz. peregrine in the fecond houfe, gives not\nriches, yet retains them when gathered, by being fparing and penurious.\nMars fo pofited and ill-effedted, difiipates or deftroys an eftatc by prodi\u00ad\ngality, and fuch other imprudent expences. Saturn, debilitated in the\neleventh houfe of a nativity, produces trouble with or by the means of\nfriends unrelated ; and the analogy is according to the debility of the pla\u00ad\nnets, and how they are beheld, and mitigated by Textiles and trines, or\ncontrarily inflamed by quartiles or oppofitions.\nAn infortune in conjundtion with a fortunate planet, is either impeded\nor deprived of the good fignified ; for, though the fortunate planet be in\nhis own houfe, yet he partakes fomething of the nature or analogy of\nthe malefic, with whom he is conjoined. Three planets or more in\nconjundtion, adl jointly and feverally according to their refpedtive na\u00ad\ntures, and to their heavenly ftates, but principally according to the nature\nand ftate of the moft ftrong and ruling planet. If an infortune, cfpecially\nSaturn, be placed between two planets which are in conjundtion, he pre\u00ad\nvents or retards the good promifed by the other two planets; the nature\nor kind thereof is diicovered by the houfe of heaven wherein fuch a con-\ngrefs is made.\nThe lord of the afeendant applying to the conjundtion of the Sun in\nany nativity, (hews the native apt, or delights to converfe with honour\u00ad\nable perfons, grandees, and fuch-like; as alfo will be ambitious of fame,\nhonour, and dignity, &c.

Two planets in reception adt or difperfe their influence in\nan amicable method, and, if benevolent by nature, their virtues are the\nmore powerful. Many planets in cardinalfigns in any geniture, always\neflfeft fome great things ; if in one houfe, the native receives or fuffer6\nan excels of good or evil, according to the nature of that houfe. The\nbenevolent planets Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury alfo, retrograde in any\nnativity, is of eminent import, adding to the felicity of a native, and this\nis the more powerful if they are applying to the conjun&ion of the earth ;\nbut the retrogradation of Saturn or Mars in angles, is ever attended with\n\u2022difficulties and unhappinefles, from which pofrtions I fhall always pray.\nLibera nos, D om ine.\nE N D of the F I R S T P A R T .\nA N\nDigitized by Go\u00bb..ale Original from\nv n o t ' Dl I P I I r I I D R A D V\n\fA N\nI L L U S T R A T I O N\nO F T H E\nCELESTIAL SCIENCE\nO F\nA S T R O L O G Y.\nP A R T t h e S E C O N D .\nC O N T A I N I N G T H E\nDOCTRINE o f NATIVITIES,\nA N D T H E\nA R T OF R E S O L V I N G H O R A R Y Q U E S T I O N S *\nT O G E T H E R W I T H\nA Collection of N ativities of the mod eminent and remarkable\nPersons, T wins, D warfs, Giants, &c.\nBy E.

So that\nfrom a queftion ferioufiy propounded almoft as much fiuisfadtion may be\ngiven the querent, upon many fubjedts of enquiry, as if his nativity were\nadtually known. For, as the nativity is the time of the birth of the body,\nthe horary queftion is the time of the birth of the mind ; and there are\nfew perfons living but are in fome way or other fubjedf to horary doubts,\nwhich, being ferioufiy propounded in the fihape of aqueftion, may befatis-\nfadtorilyrefolved. This dotlrinefeems to be founded upon that miraculous\nfympathy in nature, which is admirably manifefted between the Moon\nand thefea ; by which that amazing body of water is'conftantly drawn\nafter her, though no man fees, or can conceive, how. In thefe fympa-\nthies there can be no doubt but the vegetive foul of the world invilibly\ncarries and unites a fpecific virtue from the heavens between one thing\nand another, every where working thofe fecret effedts, which no mortal\ncan fail to admire. And in the prefent cafe, who is to determine what\nthis foul cannot effedt between the heavenly bodies and the animal\nfpirit of man, working fuch fympathies, as that a queftion of impor\u00ad\ntance to our welfare cannot ftart from the mind but in a point of time\nwhen the planets and figns governing the perfon's birth are adting up\u00ad\non the very fubjedt that engages his thoughts and attention. And .hence\nthe birth of the queftion, like the nativity of a child, carries the llory of\n. the\ne M c u i v n o \/ di id \u25a0 i r i i d d a d v\n\f278 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe whole matter in hand upon its forehead. And hence alfo follows\nthat flcill in natural predictions by which the artift is. enabled to demon-\nftrate the particulars of the event required j and this as well by the ftars\nof heaven as Abiathar the prieft was of old enabled to do by the ftars of\nthe ephod.\nBut, however, the predictions that are made from the queftionary way\nare by no means fo perfect and correct as thofe deduced from nativities ;\nand therefore I recommend all judgments of futurity to be made from na\u00ad\ntivities, when they can be procured, rather than from horary queftions.\nBut at the fame time I am very confident that theomnifcient Creator is not\nat all wanting for any poffiblecareinhis contrivance of the works of nature,\nfor the fupply of all ourmodcrate wants and enquiries. And, if it be ef-\nfcntial to man\u2019s welfare to be forewarned of thejudgment, as\nSolomon declares it is, and that the wife manJhall know it*, then it is\nplain that God has afforded means to obtain this knowledge withoutami-\nracle; and this means may furely be by the ftars of heaven, refponding\nour horary queftions j and experience continually affirms, day by day, that\nit is fo. Not that I believe the trivial concerns and accidents of mankind,\nas fome writers have pretended, may be thus deduced, as if a glove, loft or\nhidden in fport and wantonnefs, fhould be fo watched and attended by\nthe heavenly intelligencers, that they muft needs point out where this\npiece of leather were to be found ; or that queftions propounded out of\nmere curiofity or diverfion are to be refolved by them. No; God\u2019s works\nare ferious, and not to be made the fport and ridicule of the gay and incon-\nfiderate. For, although the heavenly contrivance may aptly refpond our\nferious and important concerns, as when David anxioufly defired to know\nwhether heJhou\/d go up into any of the cities ofJudah, and which of them ?\nyet that they fhould as aptly fatisfy our intemperate defires, and be fub-\nfervient to our frolics, is too ridiculous to imagine. There is no doubt\nbut the heavens are able to fhew us more learning than we mortals, in\nthis ftate of frailty and corruption, can ever attain to underftand; and it\nis a great bounty of God that we know fo much as we do ; therefore it\nhighly becomes every wife and good man to glorify the Maker of all\nthings for the little knowledge he can and doth attain, and to be careful\nhow he fports even with the leaft among his gracious works.\nAll enquiries that are ferious, and that come under the denomination\nof an horary queftion, muft neceflarily relate either to things paft, -\nfent, or to come ;or to concerns that once were, now are, or may be;\nand the anfwer to fuch queftions muft be either effential or accidental.\nThe effential anfwer is always one of the three things following, to wit,\n* Ecclcf. viii. 12. and v. 6.\n3 that\nzed by Google Original from\nicuir v n R k ' Diim ir i i p r a b v\n\fOF A S T R O L O G Y . 279\nthat the matter concerning which the enquiry is made, is fird, or\nnot to be;\nfecond,either good or b\najand third, either\nTherefore, if the quedion be real, and the matter rightly dated, the\ntrue anfwer, which is always fhort, will be eafily difeovered by the fol\u00ad\nlowing rules, 'i he accidental anfwer is that which appertains to the\naccidents of the bufmefs in hand ; and is always defined by where, when,\nhow, or why. And whoever attempts to extend his judgment beyond\nthefe limits, drains art beyond its bounds, and forces it to lpeak that\nwhich it is totally incapable of, and by this means many pretenders to\nAdrology fdil egregioufly in their undertakings. To avoid this, let the\nfallowing queries be attended to.\nQ JJ E R Y I. Is the Subjectof Enquiry t o b e , or n o t\nHere the fird thing to be attended to is the perfection or dejlruCthn of\nthe matter under confederation. The perfe&ion or completion of the\nfubjett of enquiry may be effedled four feveral ways, viz. by the ap\u00ad\nplication, t\nr\na\nn\nj\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n, reception, and pofition, of the planets ; and thefe are\ndetermined and defined by the proper and refpedlive fignificators of the\nfubjeCts of enquiry, which are, fird, the lords of thofe houfes which re\u00ad\nlate to the matter in hand ; fecondly, planets near the cufps of thofe\nhoufes ; thirdly, planets exalted or dignified therein ; and fourthly, the\nconfignificators of thofe houfes. The lords of the houfes are thofe planets\nwhich are lords of the figns that happen to fall upon the cufps of the\nhoufes. The conjignijicators, of each houfe are as follow : of the fird\nhoufe or afeendant, Saturn and Mars ; of the fecond, Jupiter and Venus ;\nof the third. Mars and Mercury ; of the fourth, Sol and Luna; of the\nfifth, Venus and Sol; of the fixth. Mercury alone; of the feventh, Lu\u00ad\nna and Venus ; of the eighth, Saturn and Mars ; of the ninth, Jupiter\nalone; of the tenth, Mars and Saturn ; of the eleventh, Sol and Saturn;\nand of the twelf'h, Venus and Jupiter. From hence it appears that\neach houfe hath a primary and fecondary confignificator ; the fird where\u00ad\nof arifes frem the order of the planets, the other from the order of the\nfigns.\nThe confideration of the matter propofed is takeli from that houfe\nwhich hath relation to, and lignification of, the fame; and this figni-\nfication of the houfes is either limple or compound. 1 he fimplc figni-\nfication of the houfes is that which hath relation fingly to the perfon\nof the querent; compound fignification is that which hath relation to\nthe matter or quefited. The querent is he or (he that afks the quedion;\nthe matter, or quefited, is that about which the quedion is propofed.\nThe fim.. le fignifications of the houfes are as follow : the nrd houfe\nsignifies the querent's life and perfon; the fecond, his fubdance; the\nNo. 14. 3 U third.\nDigitized by Goi >sle O\nriginal from\nKlPUf V f l D ^ Dl ID I IC I I D D A D V\n\f<*8o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthird, his kindred, neighbours, and fhort journeys; the fourth, his grave,\nfather, and lands; the fifth, his pleafures and offspring; the fixth, his\nfickncfs, fervants, and finall cattle > the feventh, his wife, public ene\u00ad\nmies, and law-fuits ; the eighth, his death, and legacies ; the ninth, his\nreligion, long voyages, and learning; the tenth, his mother, trade, and\nhonour; the eleventh, his friends and hopes; the twelfth, his private\nenemies, great cattle, imprifonment, and croffes. The compound figni-\nfication is derived from the Ample, by confidering what houfe that is\nwhich fignifies the matter or quefited ; and accounting that, be it what-\nfoever houfe it may, for its afeendant or firft houfe; and fo aferibing\nthe iignification of the firft houfe of the figure to it: doing in like man\u00ad\nner to all the other houfes in order. So that, if a queftion relates to a bro\u00ad\nther or relation, the third houfe is then his afeendant or firft houfe, and\nfignifies his life and perfon; the fourth houfe (which is in this cafe his\nfecond) his fubftance or eftate; the fifth houfe (his third) his relations\nand fhort journeys; the fixth (his fourth) his father; the feventh his chil\u00ad\ndren ; the eighth his ficknefs; the ninth his wife. See. and the fame of all\nothers* Thefe things being laid as a foundation, we now come to fhew\nthe perfection of the matter by the different affections of the afpeCts.\nApplication is when two planets haften to conjunction or afpeCl of one\nanother. The light planets only apply to the more weighty. So Saturn\napplies to none; Jupiter only to Saturn ; Mars to Saturn and Jupiter;\nSol to Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars; Venus to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and\nS ol; Mercury to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, and Venus; and Luna to\nthem all. But, if any of the higher planets be retrograde, they may then\napply to a lighter by retrogradation. Thus Saturn may apply to Jupiter,\nMars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna; Jupiter to Mars, Sol, Venus,\nMercury, or Luna; Mars to Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna; Venus to\nMercury, or Luna ; and Mercury to Luna, when retrograde. In this\napplication the lords of each houfe are not only to be conlidered, but alfo\nthe confignificators of the fame; for, if they alfo apply together by good\nafpeCt, we may give the more probable judgment. Thefe applications\n\u00ab may be always difeerned by the Ephemeris ; wherein may not only, be\n^ feen when the Moon applies to any afpeCt, but alfo when any of the other\nplanets apply to one another.\nTranflation is when a planet feparates from the body or afpeCt of one\nplanet, and immediately applies to the conjun&ion or afpeCt of another.\nAnd the planet tranflating is always lighter, except in retrogradation,\nthan the planets from or to whom the tranflation is made. So Luna\nmay tranflate the light of the other planets from one to another; Mercury\nmay tranflate the light of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, and Venus, from\none\nDigitized by Gov gle O\nriginal from\nM P1A\/ v n c k ' Dl ID I Ir I I D D A D V\n\fO 5* A S T R O L O G Y. *8x\none to another j Venus the light of Saturn, Jtipiter, Mars, and Sol, from\none to another j Sol the light of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, from one to\nanother;. Mars the light of Saturh and Jupiter from one to another; but\nJdpiter and Saturn, wiihout'retrogradation, can make no tranflation. This\ntranflation is to be confidcredbetwecn the lords of the houfes fignifying\nthe matter, the planets mear the cufps, and the confignificators of the\nfame. So, if the queftion belong to the feventh houfe, and Sagittarius be\non the afeendant, .then Jupiter is lord of the afeendant, and Mercury of\nthe feventh; Sattirn is the iirfl: confignificator of the afeendant, and Mars\nthe fecond ; Luna is the firft confignificator of the feventh, and Venus is\nthe fecond. And, if the tranflation be between Jupiter and Mercury, or\nSaturn and Luna, or Mars and Venus, it may poflibly perform the mat\u00ad\nter ; but, if there be a tranflation between them all, as alfo between\nplanets pofited near the cufps of the houfes, the thing will undoubt\u00ad\nedly be brought to pafe, the fame as by application. A more weighty\nplanet may alfo make a tranflation by feparating in retrogradation frort*\na weightier than himfelf, and applying to a lighter than himfelf. So\nJupiter, being retrograde, may feparate from Saturn or his afped, and\ntranflate his light and virtue to Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna.\nReception is either Angle or mutual. A Angle reception is wheft\nhut one of the fignificators receives the other into his dignities, viz. his\nhoufe, exaltation, or triplicity; this is but of fmall force, and is called\ndifpofition. Mutual reception is when two planets are in each other\u2019s\ndignities; as Mars in Gemini, and Mercury in Aries. This reception\nis threefold, either by houfe, exaltation, or triplicity. By houfe, when\nSaturn is in the houfes of Jupiter, and Jupiter in the houfes of Saturn.\nBy exaltation, as when Saturn is in Aries, the exaltation of Mars j and\nMars in Libra, the exaltation of Saturn. By triplicity, as when Saturn\nis in Leo, the triplicity of Mars, and Mars in Taurus,- the triplicity of\nSaturn. There is alfo another reception of dignities ; and that is when\none planet is in another planet\u2019s houfe, and that planet in the other\u2019s\nexaltation or triplicity. As Saturn in Taurus, the houfe of Venus, and\nVenus in Libra, the exaltation of Saturn, or in Virgo, his triplicity.\nThefe receptions are remarkably ftrong and forcing, if they fall either\nin the antifeions of each other, or in or near each other\u2019s Textile or trine.\nPofition is when either the lords of two houfes concerned, or the\nconfignificators of the fame, or both, are pofited in each other\u2019s houfes;\nor the lord of the afeendant, or its confignificator, or both, are pofited\nin the houfe fignifying the thing; or, laltly, when the lord or configni\u00ad\nficators of the houfe fignifying the thing are pofited in the afeendant.\n- \u2022 So,-\nOriginal from\nk i c u \/ d \\s m i d i i r I i d d a d v\n\f* 3 2 A N I L L tu S . T ' H T I O N\nSo, if the qucftion belongs to the medium Cceli, if the lord of the afeen-\ndant be found in the medium cceli, or lord of the medium cceli in theaf-\ncendant, or in mutual polition, it perfeds the thing defired.

And\nobferve, laftly, that, whatfoever has been faid of the impediting or hin\u00ad\ndering planet, the fame is to be underftoad of the planet adjuvant, or\nhelping.\nThe next thing to be confidered, is the propriety of the queftion pro-\npofed, and the fincerity of the querent ; for it fometimes happens that\nqueftions are improperly and incorre&ly dated; and at others, that they\nare put through knavery and impertinence, with a view to injure and\n- difgrace the artift. In thefe cafes, the queftion not being radical, no\nanfwer can be obtained ; and therefore he who attempts to refolve them\nwill bring fhame upon himfelf, and difgrace upon the fcience. Every\nqueftion, to be radical, muft be fincere and natural; and, unlefs they are\nfo, they cannot be refolved. Therefore, to afeertain their fincerity on\nthe one hand, and their fitnefs or unfitnefs on the other, the following\nrules muft be obferved.\nEredl the figure as before dire&ed; and, if the fign afeending and the\nplanet in the afeendant deferibe exactly the perfon of the querent, the\nqueftion is radical, and fit to be judged. But, if either the very begin\u00ad\nning or extreme end only of the fign afeends, it will not be proper to\ngive judgm ent; for it denotes the querent to be a knave, and the queftion\na forgery, propofed merely out of ridicule and intemperate mirth. This\nrule I have often verified in practice, by direCtly charging the querent with\nfuch defign; and the effeCt this unexpected difeovery had upon them has\nufually produced an acknowledgment of it. The fame thing is indicated\nby the quartile or oppofition of the Moon with the lord of the feventh\nhoufe; or by the Moon being void of courfe, or combuft; which pofitions\nlikewife denote the queftion to be improperly and incorreCtly ftated. Sa\u00ad\nturn in the afeendant, impedited and afflicted, (hews the queftion propofed\nto be either falfe, or without ground, or the fubject of it paft hope; and\nwhenever the lord of the afeendant is found combuft or retrograde, it in\u00ad\ndicates the fame thing, and fhews the queftion is propofed to anfwer fome\nabfurd or knavifh purpofe, and therefore not to be meddled with.\nAny queftion may be deemed radical, when the lord of the afeendant\nand the lord of the hour are of the fame nature and triplicity. Thus,\nfuppofe Leo afeends upon the horofeope at the time the queftion is pro-\nNo. 14. 3 Y pofed>\nOriginal from\nMCIA\/ v n B\nY Dl ID I Ir I I RDABV\nDigitized by Go*, sle\n\f288 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\npofed, and 'Mars happens to be lord of the hoar, the queftion will be\nradical, becaufe the Sun, which is lord of the horofcope, and Mars, arc\nof one nature, viz. hot and dry. So, if Jupiter be lord of the hour,\nthe queftion will be radical, becaufe the Sun and Jupiter are of the fame\ntriplicity ; and this obfervation extends to all the other planets, anduni-\nformly fhews the queftion proper to be judged. But, whenever the tef-\ntimonies or fignificators in the figure are found equally ftrong for and\nagainft the matter propounded, it ought not to be adjudged} for theartift\nknows not which way the balance may yield, and therefore judgement\nfhould be deferred to a future time.\nThere is one rule by which the radicalnefs of a queftion may beafcer-\ntaincd with greater certainty, or at leaft with lefs probability of mif-\ntake, than by any other} and this is by the moles with which every\nperfon is more or lefs marked. It is really an aftonifhing fa61, and no\nlefs extraordinary than true, that thefe moles or marks are all uniformly\ndiftinguiftied by the figns and planets which prevail at the time of birth,\nif not abfolutely produced by them. It was the truth and univerfality\nof this obfervation which firft led to the difcovery of that affection and\ngovernment which the celeftial figns have upon the different members of\nman\u2019s body ; a fa\u00a3l fo obvious, that, notwithftanding all endeavours to\nrefute the idea of planetary influence, yet this fadt is annually recorded\nin every almanac, and finds a place in almoft every other agronomical\npublication.\nAccording to this rule, whenever a perfon comes to propound a quef\u00ad\ntion, let a figure of the twelve houfes be eredted for the querent; then\nnote what fign is upon the cufp of the afeendant, and in the part of the\nquerent\u2019s body which that fign governs, if the queftion Be radical, the\nquerent will have a mole. For inftance, if Aries be the fign afeending\nat the time, the mole will be on the head or face; if Taurus, on the neck\nor throat; if Gemini, on the arms orfhoulders } if Cancer, on the breaft;\nand fo upon any other part of the body which the fign afeending (hall\ngovern. Obferve next, in which of the twelve houfes the lord of the\nafeendant is pofited, and in that part of the body the fign governs which\nhappens to fall upon the cufp of that houfe will the querent have another\nmole. Next obferve the fign defeending on the cufp of the fixth houfe,\nand in whatever part of the body that fign governs the querent will find\nanother mole ; and upon that member alfo which is fignified by the fign\nwherein the lord of the fixth houfe is pofited will be found another,\nObferve alfo what fign the Moon is pofited in, and in that part of the\nbody which is governed by it lhall themative or querent find another\nmole. If the planet Saturn be the fignificator, the mole is either black\nor\nDigitized by Go\u00bb.igle Original from\nm c i a \/ Dl IP I i r I I P P A P V\n\fOF A S T R O L O G Y . 289\nor of a dark colour; if Mars be fignificator, and in a fiery fign, it then re- a\nfembles a fear, cut, or dent, in the flefli ; but in any other fign it is a red r '\nmole. If Jupiter be 'tbe fignificator, the mole is of a purple or bluifli\ncaft ; if the Sun, it is of an olive or chefnut colour ; if Venus, it is yel\u00ad\nlow ; if Mercury, of a pale lead colour j if the Moon, it is whitifh, or\nparticipates of the colour of that planet with which (he happens to be in\nafpedt. And, if the planet which gives the mole be much impedited or\nafflidted, the mark or mole will be larger and more vilible.\nIf the fign and planet which gives the mark or mole be rriafculine, it\nis then fituated on the right fide of the body; but if feminine, on the\nleft fide. If the fignificator or planet which gives the mole be found a-\nbove the horizon, that is,, from the cufp of the afeendant to the cufp of\nthe feventh, either in the twelfth, eleventh, tenth, ninth, eighth, or fe-\nventh, houfe, the mark or mole will be on the fore part of the body; but\nif the fignificator be under the earth, that is, in either the firft, fecond,\nthird, fourth, fifth, or fixth,. houfe, it will be fituated on the back\nor hinder part of the body. If only a few degrees of the-fign afeend upon\nthe horofeope, or defeend on the fixth ; or if the lord of the afeendant,\nlord of the fixth, or the Moon, bepofited in the beginning of any fign ;\nthe mole or mark will be found upon the upper part of the member thofe\nfigns govern. If half the degrees of a fign afeend, or the fignificators be\npofited in the middle of any fign, the mark or inole will be in the middle\nof the member ; but, if the laft degrees of a fign afeend, or the fignifica\u00ad\ntors are in the latter degrees of a fign, the mark or mole will then be fi\u00ad\ntuated on the lower part of the member fuch fign governs.\nIf the queftion be radical, the time rightly taken, and the querent fin-\ncere, and of fufficient'age, this rule will feldom or ever be found to fail.\nIn afeertaining the exadl time of any perfon\u2019s nativity, I have found it of\nexcellent u f e ;never having been once deceived by it in the finalleft de\u00ad\ngree. In company I have frequently tried the experiment upon a ftran-\nger, and ever found it correfpond, to the aftonilhent of all perfons\nprefent ; and it is an experiment which any reader may eafily make upon\nhimfelf or friends. But in the months of November and December,\nwhen figns of fhort afeenfions are upon the afeendant, great care mud be\ntaken to beexadt in point of time ; for in thofe months the Sun is fre\u00ad\nquently not vifible, and clocks are not always to be depended upon ;\ntherefore without proper care the right afeendant may eafily be milled,\nfor Pifces and Aries both afeend in the fpace of fifty minutes, ond Aqua-\nries and Taurus in little more than an hour ; but, if the time be taken ex-\nadt, no one need ever miftruft the certainty of thefe rules, and the exact\nconformity of the marks or moles to the figns and planets which repre-\nfent\nDigitized by\n^ G o o g l e\nOriginal from\nv n o k ' Dl IPI Ir I I D R A D V\n\f*9o A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nfont them. Thus, by looking at a perfon\u2019s nativity, and attending to thefe\nrules, the reader may exactly point out and defcribe the moles in any part\nof the native\u2019s body, though it be a perfon he never faw or converfed\nwith ; and, if he is corredt :to time, he may fafel-y venture his life upon\nthe matter. And by the fame kind of fimple, eafy, and certain, rules, arc\nall predictions in aftrology managed ; fothat, inftead of calling in the aid\nof any fupernatural or infernal compadt, it only requires to be corredt to\ntime and calculation, and to know the true nature and influence of the\nplanets, and by thefe alone are the events and contigencies of futurity\ndemonftrated and foretold.\nAs thefe rules hold good upon the body of every querent, fo will they,\nm utatis m utandis,upon the body of the quefited ; for example, Suppofe\na perfon enquires concerning a wife or fweetheart, then the feventh houfe\nwill be her nrffc oralcendant, and the twelfth her fixth ; and in thofe parts\nof her body which the figns upon the cufps of thofe houfes govern fhall\n\u00a3be have moles ; and fo by the Moon and other fignificators. It is alfo\nfound by conftant obfervation, that an infortune pofitedin the afeendant\nalways marks theface with a mole or fear; for the afeendant oriirft houfe\nalways reprefents the face, let what fign foever afeend; thefecond repre-\nfents the neck, the third the arms and flioulders, the fourth the breaft,\nand fo on, every houfe and fign in order, according to its fucceffion. It\nis alfo obfervable, that, if the Moon be in conjundlion or oppofition of the\nSun, in an evil afpedt to Mars, apd in angular houfes, the querent has a\nnatural infirmity or blemifh in or near one of his eyes.

When the fignificators are unfortunately afpedted\nfrom good places of the figure, or the benevolent planets interpofe their\nrays, the malevolence threatened will be fomewhat abated ; but if it be\nfrom evil houfes in the horofcope, and the benevolent planets afford no\nhelp, danger of a fhort life is much to be feared.\nO f the Good or E v il attending L ife ?\nThe good or evil that attends each perfon is diftinguiflied by the for\u00ad\ntunate and unfortunate radiations in the figure. When benevolent pla\u00ad\nnets poffels the afcendant, or the principal places of the figure, they in\u00ad\ndicate much good to the querent through the whole courfe of his life.\nAnd if the lord of the afcendant and the Moon be friendly afpedted by\nthe beams of the fortunes, although from malignant places of the fcheme,\nyet it prefages good to the native, inafmuch as an accidental evil cannot\nrebate or withftand an effential good. But when the infortunes poffefs\nthefe places, or by evil afpedt afflidt the fignificators, the querent will be\nfubjedt to a troublefome life. If Saturn poffefs the afcendant, the querent\nwill be melancholy and penfive, and fubjedt to perplexities from aged\nmen. If Mars, he will be choleric, and liable to oppreflion by knaves\nand fwindlers, and fometimes by the treachery of kindredj if the Dra\u00ad\ngon\u2019s Tail be in the afcendant, he will never be free from fcandal and dif-\ngrace. When the afflidting planets are lords of unpropitious houfes,\nthe evil will be longer durable ; but, when the affifting planets are lords\nof good houfes, the good will be the more permanent. Note alfo the\nhoufes thofe planets govern j for from thence is difeovered by what\nmeans the querent fhall be fortunate or unhappy. And, as the malignant\nbeams of the evil planets prevent or eclipfe the good that is fignified, fo\nJhe benevolent rays of the fortunate ftars reverberate much of the mif-\nchief portended : by duly confidering which, according to the ftrength of\nthe planets affifting or afflidting, the extent of the good or evil that at\u00ad\ntends each querent\u2019s life may be nearly afeertained.\nNo. 15. 3 Z In\nOriginal from\nM P \/ i f VflDfc' Dl IQI I f I IDE?\nDigitized by Goosle\n\fA N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nIn w h a t Timethe N a tiv e may a\nWhenever this queftion is ferioufly propounded, and the nativity of\nthe proponent not attainable, (for, if the nativity can be had, horary\nqueftions are ufelefs,) ereCt the figure, and draw it into a fpeculum, and\ndireCf the feveral fignificators to their promittors, as in a nativity. Find\nthe true diftance of each fignificator from its promittor, and turn it into\ntime, as in a nativity, and according to the effects of the directions judge\nof it. But this method is only to be taken when queftions of weighty\nconcern are propounded; upon any trivial or ordinary bufinefs it is wholly\nunneceflary. In matters of little importance, it is fufficient to ob-\nferve the degrees of diftance between the fignificators, either of their\nbodies or afpedts, which will point out the time correCtly enough. When\nfixed ftars of a violent nature occupy the principal parts of the figure,\nthe afcendant, mid-heaven, or place of the Moon, they prefage fudden and\nunexpected mifchief; but, when fixed ftars of a noble and generous na\u00ad\nture poflefs thofe places, they demonftrate fudden and permanent good\nto the querent.\nW h a t P a r t o f the Q uerent's L ife is likely to be m of profperous f\nTo refolve this queftion, it only requires to obferve in what part of the\nfigure the fortunate ftars are, and according to their pofition judge of it.\nIf the propitious planets are in the afcendant, the twelfth or eleventh\nhoufes, the native will profper moft in his younger days. If in the tenth,\nninth, or eighth, in the middle part of his age. If in the feventh, fixth,\nor fifth, after his middle age. If in the fourth, third, or fecond, his\nlatter days will be the moft comfortable and happy. The time is afcer-\ntained by reckoning for every houfe fituated between the fortunate\nplanets and the afcendant five years, if the fignificators of life be weak ;\nif moderately dignified, fix ; but, if the fignificators of life are remarka\u00ad\nbly ftrong and well dignified, then feven years may be reckoned for every\nhoufe.\nT ow ard w h a t P a r t o f the W orld may the Shierent direSi his Courfe to\nprofper?\nIt is a misfortune not very uncommon for perfons to undertake long\njourneys and voyages, much to their prejudice and difadvantage ; for, al\u00ad\nthough all places are alike to him that made the earth, yet they are not fo\nto men that poffefs i t ; therefore it will be requifite for thofe who judge\nqueftions of this kind to obferve the following rules, or at leaft as many\nof tfiem as may be neceflary.

For example, fuppofe thefe planets (hall be in the mid-heaven,\nthat being fouth, diredt the querent fouthward; if they be in the ninth,\nit is beft to go fouth-weft. If in the weft, it is his intereft to go full\nweft; and fo of the reft. Confider alfo the nature of the querent's de-\nfire, whether it be for health, riches, honour, friends, &c. that he en\u00ad\ngages in his undertaking; for, by rightly undcrfhnding the queftion, the\nquerent\u2019s defire (hall be the more readily anfwered. If it be for health\nhe would remove his habitation, obferve where or in what quarter the\nlord of the afcendant and the Moon are pofited, and diredt him that\nway. If for riches, take notice of the lord of the fecond and the part\nof fortune. If for honour, confider the Sun and the lord of the tenth*\nIf for friends, the lord of the eleventh; and fo of the other fignificators.\nA Perfonhavin g im portant Bufmefs w ith another, Jhall befin d him a t Home ?\nThe truth I have always found in the anfwers to this queftion princi\u00ad\npally induced me to give it a place here; for I have often tried the ex\u00ad\nperiment, both for myfelf and others, and have never known it to fail.\nThe rules are thefe: If you would fpeak with a perfon that you have fa\u00ad\nmiliar andconftant dealings with, but no way related, take the feventh\nhoufe and his lord to fignify him, that is the feventh from the afcendant;\nfor the afcendant always fignifies the querent. If the lord of the fe\u00ad\nventh be in any of the four angles, viz. in the firft, fourth, feventh, or\ntenth, houfes, the perfon you would fpeak with is certainly at home. If\nthe lord of the feventh be in any of the luccedent houfes, viz. in the fe\u00ad\ncond, fifth, eighth, or eleventh, he is not then at home, but is near it,\nand may with a little diligence be found; but if the lord of the feventh\nbe in any one of the cadent houfes, viz. the third, fixth, ninth, or\ntwelfth, the party is far from home, and confcquently cannot be\nwith if fought for. If the lord of the afcendant apply to the lord of the\nfeventh by a friendly afpedt at the time of enquiry, the querent may per\u00ad\nhaps meet the quelited, or accidentally hear of him by the way. Or, if\nthe Moon or any other planet transfer the light of the lord of the feven.h\nto the lord of the afcendant, it denotes the fame thing. The nature and\nfex of the planet transferring the light denotes what manner of perfon\nfliall give notice to the querent of the perfon he enquires after, accord\u00ad\ning\nDigitized by Go<.>sle Original from\nm p a \/ di i m 1r i i b b a b v\n\f294 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\ning to the fign and quarter he is pofited in. But, if the perfon enqui\u00ad\nred after be a relation, then the lord of the feventh is not to be taken,\nbut the lord of that houfe which fignifies fuch relation; as, if it be a\nbrother, then the lord of the third mud be referred to; if a father, re\u00ad\ngard mud be had to the lord of the fourth ; if a fon or daughter, obferve\nthe lord of the fifth, and foon; and, according to their politions, judge\nas above fpecified.\ntheP a r ty long abfentbe dead or alive ?\nHerein alfo mud be confidered what relation the querent hath to the\nparty quefited, and take the fignificator accordingly. But, if there be no\nrelation between them, then take the afcendant, his lord, and the Moon,\nto fignify the party that is abfent; and judge thus: If the lord of the\nafcendant, or the Moon, be in conjunction with the lord of the eighth,\nor a planet in the eighth, and no benevolent teftimonies concur, the ab\u00ad\nfent party is certainly dead. Or when the Moon, and the lord of the\nafcendant, fhall be in oppofition to the lord of the eighth, from the fe-\ncond and eighth, or from the fixth and twelfth, houfes, the abfent party\nis likewife dead. If the lord of the afcendant be in the fourth, and the\nMoon in the feventh, in quartile to him, it fhews great danger to the\nquefited, if not abfolute death. When an evil planet fhall tranfiate the\nlight of the lord of the eighth unto the lord of the afcendant, or of the\nlord of the afcendant to the lord of the eighth, it is moft probable the\nabfent party is dead. If the lord of the afcendant and the Moon be in\nthe fourth houfe from the afcendant, or in the houfe of death, and either\ncombuft, or in their fall, or joined with the lord of the eighth, the par\u00ad\nty quefited is undoubtedly deceafed; but if none of thefe pofitions hap\u00ad\npen, and on the contrary you find the Moon, and the afcendant, and its\nlord, flrong and well fortified, the abfent party is alive and well. If the\nlord of the afcendant, or the Moon, feparate from the lord of the fixth,\nthe abfent party has been lately fick; if from the lord of the eighth,\nhe has been in danger of death; if from the lord of the twelfth, he has\nbeen in prifon, and fuffered much anxiety of mind. And, by thus vary\u00ad\ning the rule, his condition, according to the application and feparation\nof the fignificators, will be corredlly found.\nO f a Ship a t Sea, her Safety or D e fru ftio n ?\nThis queftion, although attributed by the ancient Arabian and Latin\naftrologers to the ninth houfe, becaufe it relates to voyages, yet the\njudgment hereof being fuch asproperly relates to the firft houfe or afcen\u00ad\ndant\nDigitized by Google Original from\nK\nH\nZ t \\sr\\o is m i n i i r- i i n n A n v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 295\ndant, I have for that reafon referred it thereto.

But when all the fignificators are free, and no way\nimpedited, it denotes the (hip to be in a very good and profperous con\u00ad\ndition, and all the perfons and things on-board her. If the afcendant and\nthe Moon be unfortunate, and the lord of the afcendant drong, and in a\ngood houfe, it indicates the (hip to be in an ill condition; but the men,\n&c. that are on-board her, will do well, and come home in fafety.

But if the infortunate be Mars, and he in any ot his efiential\ndignities, or afpedting a place where he hath ftrength, or pofited in an\nearthy fign, he portends the farne mifehief, with the additional misfortune\nof the crew being either taken by an enemy, imprifoned, or carried into\nflavery. But if the fortunes caft their friendly beams unto either of the\naforefaid places, and the lords of the angles, particularly of the afeendant\nand the difpofitor of the Moon, be free, it denotes that, although the {hip\n{hall undergo much damage, or be loft, yet the major part of the men and\ngoods (hall be faved. But if Mars afflidt the lords of the angles, and dif\u00ad\npofitor of the Moon, the men and the {hip will be in danger of pirates,\nor of a public enemy. And, if any other evil affedtions appear in the figns,\nthere will be quarrelling and contention, or fome dangerous mutiny, in\nthe ftiipj and this will chiefly happen when the infortunes are located in\nthofe figns which difpofe of the parts in the upper divifion of the {hip.\nBut, if Saturn afflict in the fame manner as above recited of Mars, there\nwill be many difturbances in the {hip, but no bloodihed.

If fiery figns be in the mid\u00ad\nheaven, near violent fixed ftars, and Mars prove the affli&ing planet, the\n{hip will be burnt, either by fome accident within her, or by lightning,\nor by the falling of fome inflammable meteor.

If Saturn be\nthe threatening planet inftead of Mars, and pofited in the mid-heaven,\nthe veffel will be caft away, or damaged by the motion of violent ftorms\nand winds, or by reafon of leaks, or bad fails; and the danger will be\neither greater or lefs, in proportion to the dignity or power of the infor\u00ad\ntune, and his diftance from the beams of the benevolent planets.\nIf the lord of the afeendant in the figure be fortunate, the {hip Cball\nreturn with fafety and good fuccefs j but, if he be unfortunate, Ihe {hall\nfuffer much lofs and damage.

But, if none of thefe portions hap\u00ad\npen, then note Jupiter, the natural fignificator of fubftance; or Venus,\nwho alfo is a fortune; or the Dragon\u2019s head, which always portends\ngood; and if they be free from the ill beams of the infortunes, or happen\nto be poll ted in the houfe of fubftance, the querent will moil certainly be\nrich, and will bear great fway in the place where he lives. When Saturn,\nMars, or the Dragon\u2019s tail, are pofited in the fecond houfe, or affliCt the\nlord of the fecond, Jupiter, Venus, or part of fortune, it is an argument\nthat the querent will not attain riches; or, if he were in a good capacity,\nhe will be reduced to a very mean fituation. The fignificators of fub\u00ad\nftance fwift in motion, and in good parts of the figure, and free from af\u00ad\nfliction, fliew the querent will be rich of a fudden; but, if they are flow\nin motion, though not afflicted, the querent will attain riches but flow.\nly ; particularly if the planets fignifying riches are ponderous, and in\nfixed figns.\nB y w h a tM eans Jhall the Q uerent attain Riches ?\nThe fignificators of fubftance, their feveral locations, and the houfes\nthey govern, are in this queftion to be particularly attended to; for\nfrom thence is known by what means riches come. If the lord of the\nfecond houfe, or the other fignificators of fubftance, be fortunately placed\nin the afcendant, the querent will attain great riches without much la\u00ad\nbour, in a manner unexpectedly ; but, if the lord of the fecond be in the\nfecond, it fhews the querent will obtain an eftate by his own induftry.\nThe adjuvant planets lituated in the afcendant, or the lord thereof, denote\nthe querent will advance himfelf by his own induftry.

When the lord of the eighth is pofited in the firft or\nfecond houfe, and the lord of the fecond fhall receive him, it denotes the\nperfection of the bufinefs enquired after.

When\na fortunate planet is in the afcendant, and the lord of the afcendant be\u00ad\nholds the cufp of the third, or applies friendly to the lord of the third, it\nisan argument of agood difpolition in the querent, and fpeaks him willing\nto accord with his brethren, kindred, and neighbours. And if a fortune\nbe in the third, and the lord of the third apply in harmony to the lord of\nthe afcendant, the brethren, kindred, or neighbours, are moft indulging.\nThofe perfons whofe fignificators do not apply are moft imperious, and\napt to difigree; and thofe, whofe fignificators make application, are flexi\u00ad\nble, willing, and yielding, and defirous of agreement and concord. When\nSaturn, Mars, or the Dragon\u2019s Tail, in fuch a quertion, fhall be in the\nafcendant, it denotes the perlon enquiring to be obftinate, and averfe\nto a friendly agreement; but if they, or either of them, are pofited in\nthe third houfe, the brethren, neighbours, and kindred, are of a malicious\ndifpofition. And, if it happens that Saturn or Mars be peregrine, re\u00ad\ntrograde, or combuft, the malice and mifehief they threaten will be the\nmore dangerous. When Saturn or the Dragon\u2019s Head are in the third,\nthe neighbours are obftinate, and the kindred covetous and fparing. If\nMars, the kindred are treacherous, and the neighbours difhoneft. And\nthis is more certain, when they are out of their eflential dignities.\nO f theCondition and EJiateo f an abfent B roth er ?\nTo refolve this quertion, confider the lord of the third houfe, for that\nhath rtgnification of brethren ; and the houfe where he is pofited, becaufe\nthat fliews the ftate and condition of the quefited. For if the lord of the\nthird be in conjundtion, quartile, or oppoiition, of the infortunes, or in\nevil afpedt of the lords of theobfeure houfes, the condition of the brother\nis forrowful; but if on the contrary he be in good afpedt with the for\u00ad\ntunes, and in propitious places of the figure, his condition is good and\nprofperous.

If the lord of the third be pofited in the fifth,\nin conjuu&ion with the lord of the fifth, with or without the reception\nof the fortunes, it fhews the abfent brother to be in health and very happi\u00ad\nly fituated.

But if he be found\nin any of the obfeure parts of the figure, which are naturally evil, as the\nfixth, eighth, or twelfth, houfes, the abfent brother is not well, nor in\na profperous fituation. Wh\u00a3n the lord of the third is found in the eighth,\neither in conjunction, fextile, or trine, of one of the fortunes, the abfent\nbrother is not well; or if the lord of the third be joined to evil planets\nin the fixth houfe, or in conjunction with the lord of the fixth, he is\nthen in an infirm and fickly condition; and if the lord of the fixth be in\nthe third, except the lord of the third he well difpofed, it denotes the\nfame. Then note whether the lord of the third be in conjunction with\nthe lord of the eighth, or in combuftion ; for fuch a configuration de\u00ad\nclares he will die of the infirmity. But, if the lord of the third be in the\nfeventh, the brother is in the fame country he went into at firft, and con\u00ad\ntinues there; and his condition is neither well nor ill. If the fignificator\nbe in the eighth, the abfent brother is in danger of death, particularly\nif he be combuft, or in conjunction with the lord of the eighth, in con\u00ad\njunction or afpeCt of the infortunes; for thefe are ftrong arguments of\ndeath. When the lord of the third is in the ninth, it denotes that the\nabfent brother is removed from the place he firft went to, and is gone\ninto a more remote country. And if he be in the tenth, in conjunction\nor good afpeCl of the fortunate planets, and with reception, it denotes\nhim to have acquired fome honour, office, or preferment, in the place\nwhere he lives. But, if he be in conjunction, quartile, or oppofition,\nof the infortunes, combuft, or any other way infortunated, it is to be\nfeared the abfent brother is dead. If the lord of the third be in the\neleventh houfe, in conjunction, fextile, or trine, of the fortunes, or in\nconjunction with the lord of the eleventh, it denotes the abfent brother\nto be at the houfe or place of fome friend, where he is happy and well);\nbut, if he be malicioufiy beheld of the unfortunate planets, he is not\npleafed with the fituation he is in, but is grieved and perplexed.

If the lord of the afcendant, or the\nMoon, be in the fourth houfe, or the lord of the fourth in the firft, or if\neither of them are in conjunction with the lord of the fourth, or in fextile\nor trine to him with reception, it declares the accomplishment of the\nthing without impediment or hindrance. But if they are joined without\nreception, or in quartile or oppofition with perfect reception, the que\u00ad\nrent may poffibly obtain his defire. Or if the fignificators be not joined\ntogether, either by body or afpeCt, yet, if there be a tranllation of light\nbetween them, either by the Moon or another planet, it fhews a pof-\nJibility of the purchafe, though with much difficulty and trouble.\nThe following is alfo a good method to judge of this q u e f t i o n Gi v e\nthe fign afeending, and the lord thereof, and the planet from whom the\nMoon is Separated, to the querent or purchafer; the Seventh houfe and\nhis lord, the planet or planets pofited therein, and the Moon, to fignify\nthe thing to be bought or purchaSed; and the mid-heaven to fignify the\nprice thereof. And if in your figure the lord of the afcendant behold the\nlord of the Seventh, and the lord of the Seventh apply to the lord of the\nafcendant, the feller hath a great defire, to deal with the buyer; and if they\nchance to be in each other\u2019s dignities, or any good tranllation of light hap\u00ad\npen between them, or if they apply to corporal conjunction, the que\u00ad\nrent will agree with the feller without much difficulty or trouble.\nBut, if the application or tranllation of light be by quartile or oppofition,\nthe buyer and feller will at laft agree; but it will be with much labour\nand lofs of time, and after many probabilities of breaking off.

If the lord of the fourth be infortunated, either\nby retrogradation, detriment, fall, or peregrination, it denotes the houfe\nor land to be bad, or fo encumbered that it will never continue long\nwith the purchafer. But, if the fortunate planets or the Dragon\u2019s\n*Tailbe\nin the fourth houfe, itihews the bufinefs enquired after to be good; and\nthe buyer or purchafer fhall be a gainer thereby. When the fortunate\n\u2022planets caft their benevolent rays unto the fourth houfe, and the lord of\nthe fourth (hall be pofited in a good houfe, in fextile or trine to the fe-\ncond houfe or its lord, it is an argument that the bargain is good, and\nthe purchafer (hall be a gainer thereby. If Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius, be\nupon the culp of the fourth houfe, it denotes an eftate to be hilly, hard, and\ndry. If Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn, the land is level, and very good.\nIf Gemini, Libra, or Aquaries, the ground is fome part high and fomc\nlow ; and is in quality neither very good nor very bad. If Cancer, Scor\u00ad\npio, or Pifces, it abounds with much water. An unfortunate planet in\nthe fourth, retrograde, (hews the land or houfe will turn out very un\u00ad\nlucky, and not be worth the taking, and will be accompanied with many\ninfelicities; but if a fortunate planet be pofited there ftrong, the land is\ngood, and may well invite the querent to go on, for he will have a good\nbargain.\nI f bejlf o r a Perfon to r\ne\nm\no\nv\ne,or abide w here be is?\nIn this queftion give the afcendant and the lord thereof to fignify\nthe querent; the feventh houfe and lord thereof, to fignify the place\nto which he would go ; the fourth houfe and his lord,j\u00a3the fubftanea ef'\n4b\u00bb qusrent; and the tenth houfe and his lord, the profit of removal.\nThe lord of the afcendant or fourth in the feventh, and the lord of the\nafcendant and feventh, fortunate planets, fwift in motion, ftrong, and po\u00ad\ntent where they are, the querent then will do well to remain where he is,\nand not remove.

Whenever this is fufpeded to be the cafe,\nand a queftion is grounded upon it, ere6l your figure, and confider what\napplication, reception, tranflation, 6cc. there may be between the lords\nof the afcendant and fourth houfe. If there be a friendly application\nand reception, the perfon enquiring fhall obtain the treafure he enquires\nafter; but, if there be a quartile or oppofition between the fignificators,\nwithout the reception, the treafure will rarely be found. When\nthe fignificators apply to each other corporally in a fixed fign, there are\ngreat hopes of finding and obtaining the fame fpeedily; particularly\nif the application be in a good houfe. Both or either of the luminaries in\nthe afcendant no way unfortunate, or friendly beholding the fame,\nargues a fpeedy recovery of the treafure h id ; but, if they fhould\nhappen to be cadent, or in quartile or oppofition thereto, it gives\nbut fmall hopes. If the part of fortune be in the afcendant, beheld\nby fortunate planets, or by the luminaries, the querent will have a\nfairprofpeCt of acquiring his wiflies; but, if the part of fortune and\nthe luminaries be cadent, particularly the Moon; and neither of the\nlights caft a friendly afpeCt to the part of fortune, or to the afcendant;\nnor the lord of the afcendant beholding the afcendant; it is an argument\nthat the querent will not obtain the treafure hid. I always find, in quef-\ntions of this nature, when fortunate planets are in the fourth, or\ngovern the fourth, that there is treafure; and, if the lord of the al-\ncendant, or the Moon, be in good afpedt with thofe planets, the que\u00ad\nrent generally attains it by diligent fearch.

When Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragon's\nHead, are in the fourth houfe, they declare the treafure to be in the\nplace fuppofed; and, if they be in their eflential dignities, it is very\ncertain that there is great value there. Or if any of the other planets\nare polited in their own houfes, or in the fourth houfe without impedi\u00ad\nment, it fhews that there is treafure in the place fuppofed. But if the\nfourth houfe be infortunated with the Dragon\u2019s Tail, or Saturn or Mars\nbe there, and no way eifentially dignified; or if Saturn or Mars caft a\nquartile or oppofition thereunto; there is no treafure at all. The lord of\nthe fourth,or the Moon, feparating from good planets, (hew that there has\nbeen treafure hid in the piece fuppofed, but that it is gone.\nShall the Querent enjoy the EJlate of his Father ?\nThis queftion is oftentimes of great importance to the proponent, and\ntherefore ought to be contemplated with more than ufual acutenefs. If\nin the figure, judicioufiy erefted, and corre6l to time, the lord of the fe-\ncond and lord of the fifth are found in the mutual dignities of each\nother; or the lord of the fecond in the fifth, or the lord of the fifth in\nthe fecond, the querent will enjoy the eftate of his father. But if the\nlord of the fifth houfe be retrograde, or affli&ed by fome malevolent pla\u00ad\nnet, it prefages that much of the eftate which the querent\u2019s father intend\u00ad\ned for him will be wafted, or otherways difpofed of. When the lord of\nthe fifth difpofes of the part of fortune in the afeendant, or fecond\nhoufe of the figure, there is no fear but the querent will enjoy what he\nexperts from his father.

Signs of a mafeuline difpofition, or nature, are Aries, Ge\u00ad\nmini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquaries.

If Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragon\u2019s\nHead, be in a fruitful fign, either in the fifth or afeendant, it is potfible\nfor the querent to have three children ; particularly if the Moon lends\nher afiiilance. But, if thefe planets are not pofited in the afeendant, or\nfifth houfe; yet, if they caft their friendly rays to either of them, it is\nan argument that the querent will have twins. But, if fixed figns, or\nmoveable, poflefs the cufps of the afeendant or fifth houfe, and the Sun\nor Moon be pofited therein, it is a certain argument that the woman is\nbreeding with but one child.\nW\nh\ne\nn,orinwhat T\ni\nm\ne, willtheBirthhappen?\nTo refolve this queftion, regard muft be had to the fignificators as well\nof the child as of the perfon enquiring; and to the part of children alfo, (as\nNo. 16. 4 E will\nDigitized by G O O g l C\nOriginal from\nm c w \/ D i i m i r 1 i r b a b v\n\fSi2 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nwill be explained hereafter,) which muft be diredfced by the oblique afcen-\nfions, &c. to the degree of the fifth houfe or its lord, or to Jupiter, or\nto his good afpedtsj and, by allowing a day to each degree of diftance, the\ntime of birth will be nearly found. This is difcovered by confidering\nwhat diredion or tranfit there may be either to the fifth houfe, or to Ju\u00ad\npiter, Venus, or the Moon, for at that time the woman may be delivered;\nparticularly if the true tranfit or diredion falls in the fifth, eleventh, or\nafcendant.\nOf a Mejfengerfent onanEm\nbaffy, oro\nnanyim\np\nWhen this queftion is propofed, give the afcendant and its lord to\nhim that fent the mefienger j the feventh houfe and its lord to fignify\nhim to whom the mefienger is fent; and let the Moon fignify the meffage\nitfelf; and the lord of the fifth the mefienger, and his management or\nordering of the bufinefs. When the lord of the fifth houfe fhall feparate\nfrom the lord of the feventh, and apply to the lord of the afcendant,\nthen judge the mefienger hath affeded his bufinefs, and is returning again.\nAnd, if he feparates from the lord of the fecond, he then brings money\nwith him, let the fignificator of that houfe be either a fortune or infor\u00ad\ntune. If the fignificator of the mefienger feparates from fortunate planets,\nit is an argument he has been honeft, and will bring good tidings of the\nbufinefs ; but, if he feparates from the malevolents, it {hews the mef-\nfenger has done his bufinefs lamely, or has been hindered in the per\u00ad\nformance of it. If the fignificator of the mefienger applies to an infor\u00ad\ntune by quartile or oppofition, and this before he can feparate from the\nlord of the feventh, it fignifics that the mefienger has met with fome\nimpediment in the bufinefs he went about from the party to whom he\nwas fent. But, if the fignificator of the mefienger fhall go to the quar\u00ad\ntile or oppofition of either of the infortunes, after he is feparated from\nthe lord of the feventh ; the mefienger will receive fome prejudice or\nimpediment in his way home. If there be found an infortune in the\nninth, the mefienger will not travel fafe, but will be in danger of high\u00ad\nway robbery, and bodily hurt; but if, on the contrary, a benefic be in\nthe ninth, he will travel fafe. If the lord of the afcendant and lord of\nthe fifth are in reception, or in good afpedl from good places of the figure.,\nthe mefienger is faithful, juft, and honeft; particularly if he be either a\nfortune, or in good afpedt with a fortune. But, if there be no reception\nor afpebt, and the configuration be with or in the dignities of an infortune,\nthe contrary may be expedted. If there happens a reception between\nthe lord of the feventh and the lord of the fifth, the mefl'enger will be\nreceived; and, if at the fame time the lord of the fifth or Mercury\ntranflates the virtue of the lord of the feventh to the lord of the afcen-\n2 dant.\nOriginal from\nM P U \/ d i i p i i r i i d r a d v\nDigitized by Got.>gle\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y. 313\ndant, the querent obtains whatfoever he hoped for by themeflage; which\nI have found true in a variety of inftances.\nJU D G M EN TS proper to the SIX TH HOUSE.\nThe fixth houfe gives judgment on ficknefs, fervants, and fmall cattle,\n&c. and the following questions are commonly attributed to i t :\n1.

If the afcendant be Scorpio, and\nMars and Venus be in the afcendant, or fixth houfe, the difeafe lies in the\nhead, bowels, and fecrets, becaufe Mars governs thofe members in either\nplace ; which rule holds good with all the other figns and planets.\nIs the Difeafe in the Body or Mind, or in both ?\nThe afcendant and the difpofitors of the Sun and the Moon bear figni-\nfication of the mind, and the lord of the afcendant and the Moon of the\nbody.

If Venus, by difappointments in love ; if\nMars, or Mercury, by a too intenfe exercife of the mind, by Study, or\nby application to fcience or philofophy.\nShallthe Difeafebechronicoracute?\nTo know this, confider the complexion of the perfon, his age, and the\ntime of the year; for the knowledge of thefe conduce much to the dif-\ncovery of the certainty of the matter propounded. Difeafes in autumn\nand winter are ufually reputed chronical or long; but longer in winter\nthan in autumn. In fpring and fummer, acute or Short; but more acute\nin fpring than in fummer. So infirmities affli&ing young perfons, or\nthofe in the firft half of their age, are Shorter and lefs dangerous than\nthofe in elderly perfons, or thofe that are in the laft part of their age.\nLikewife, melancholy and phlegmatic perfons arefubjed to chronical dif-\neafes; but fanguine and choleric perfons to acute. Saturnine difeafes,\nwhich are cold and dry, are ufually long and tedious; the Moon and\nVenus are protraders of the infirmity; Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, and\nMercury, fignify difeafes of no long continuance, but fuch as may re\u00ad\nturn fpcedily ; but, by being lords of evil places, or otherwise afflided,\nthey may have Signification of chronic difeafes. The figns poffeffing the\nafeendant, Sixth houfe, or place of the Moon, being fixed, declare a\nchronic difeafe; common figns Shew difeafes neither very long nor very\nShort; moveable figns denote the difeafe to terminate quickly, either\none way or the other. An infortune being lord of the fixth, and in the\nfixth, prefages a lafting ficknefs; but, if a benefic be lord of the fixth,\nand in the fixth, the difeafe will admit of an immediate cure. The lord of\nthe afeendant, the Moon, or lord of the fixth, in conjundion, Textile, or\ntrine, of the lord of the tenth, denotes the difeafe to be of no long con\u00ad\ntinuance; and if they be in conjundion, Textile, or trine, of the fortunes,\nthe fame. But if the faid fignificators, or any of them, be in conjunc\u00ad\ntion, quartile, or oppofition, of the infortunes, the difeafe will be both\nlong and tedious; and, if this fhall happen in fixed figns, it argues the\nduration or continuance to be Still the longer.\nWhatistheC\naufeoftheD\nijlem\nper?\nThe caufe of the diftemper is known from the pofitions of the fignifica\u00ad\ntors of ficknefs, before described, in either of the four trigons or triplici-\nties; for therein they Shew the humour that is predominant.

But, if the fignificators be in airy figns, blood is then predomi\u00ad\nnant in the body, and the difeafe is thence cauied j as gouts, leprofies,\n&c. When the fignificators of ficknefs are in earthy figns, they declare\nthe cauie of the difeafe to have its origin from melancholy, and thofe\ndifeafes are ufually long and tedious, as confumptions, agues, &c. And\nthe fignificators of difeafes in watery figns denote the infirmity to pro\u00ad\nceed from cold and moift caufes, as phlegm; and thefe difeafes principally\nare coughs, phthyfic, and all difeafes of the ftomach. When the pofitions\nof the fignificators do not thoroughly point out the nature of the diftem-\nper, note the fixed ftars in the figure, and they will afiift in the difcovery\nof the caufe of the difeafe.\nShalltheJick Partyrecover, ordieofthe\nIf the Moon deilux from the infortunes, and apply to the benevolents\nwithout fruftration, prohibition, or refranation, there is great hopes the\ninfirm party will recover; fo the fignificators of ficknefs, no-way af\u00ad\nflicted, but free from the ill beams of the malevolents, declare great\nhopes of the recovery of the fick. If they are in fextile or trine of the\nluminaries, or in any friendly reception with them, or either of them,\nthe fame. The Moon, encreafing in light and motion, and being pofited\nin good houfes of heaven, in fextile or trine of the lord of the afcendant,\ndenotes great hopes of life; if the lord of the afcendant be an infortune\nin this judgment, it will no-way affeCt the fick party. When the Moon\n{hall either be found in the afcendant, or in any of her dignities, or fhall\ncaft a fextile or trine thereunto, it is a great argument the fick will not\ndie of the difeafe afflicting. The lord of the afcendant and the Moon\ncombuft of the Sun denote death, unlefs there be fome reception between\nthe Sun and them; and, if they (hall be in conjunction with the lord of\nthe eighth, except Jupiter or Venus interpofe their friendly beams, it\n{hews the fame. The lord of the eighth in an angle, and the Moon and\nlord of the afcendant cadent, or afflicted of the infortunes, prefage mor\u00ad\ntality ; the application of the lord of the afcendant or the Moon unto\nthe lord of the eighth by evil afpeCt, fhews the fame; and, if he be an\ninfortune, it puts the matter pall all doubt. The lord of the afcendant\nin the eighth, or lord of the eighth in the afcendant, declares the irre-\ncovery of the fick.

When the\nlord of the afeendant, the Moon, or Venus, are in the feventh houfe, or\nin the dignities of the lord of the feventh, and the lord of the feventh\neither in the afeendant, or in fextile or trine to the faid fignificators, the\nquerent will certainly marry. If none of thefe arguments appear, but\non the contrary all the fignificators of marriage are in Aerile- figns, and\nin quartile or oppofition to the lord of the feventh, or feventh houfe, the\nparty enquiring is averfe to marriage.\nA t what TimeJhall the Querent marry ?\nThe fignificators of marriage applying to each other by a friendly afpeft,\nor by conjunction in the oriental or meridional parts of heaven, denote\nthe querent will be married fuddenly j but, if in the occidental part of\nheaven, or feptentrional, it will be much prolonged, and a great while\nbefore accomplifhed.

Many planets in the feventh\nhoufe, in fextile or trine to the luminaries or lord of the afcendant, denote\nthe querent will be married more than once. But, if the fignificators of\nmarriage are in fixed figns, and in afpedt with not above one planet, it\nprefages that the querent will marry only once.\nWhat KindofPerfonJhalltbeQ\nuerent , andhowqualified?\nObferve what planet the lord of the afcendant, or Moon, is neareft in\nafpedt with, and the fign he is in, and defcribe the perfon, either man\nor woman, accordingly; for fuch a one the querent will marry. If the\nlord of the afcendant or Moon be in conjunction or afpedt with Venus,\nthe perfon is pleafant and affable; if with the Sun, he is noble, of a\ngreat fpirit, and imperious; if with Mars, the perfon is many times rafh\nand furious, and fubjedt to choler and paffion ; if with Saturn, he is in\u00ad\nclinable to melancholy, but prudent and grave; if with Jupiter, the\nperfon is juft, honeft, and religious; if with Venus, fubtil, cunning,\n&c. Note the fixed ftars that are near the fignificators, for they often\nalter the quality of the planets. By thus confidering the dignities and\ndebilities of the planet or planets aforefaid, the fhape, qualification, and\ntemperature, of the perfon whom the querent fhall marry, may be known\nand difeovered.\nShalltheyaccordandbehappyafterM\narriage?\nThe lord of the afcendant, or Moon, in conjundtion, fextile, or trine,\nof the lord of the feventh or Venus, argues much pleafure and delight\nafter marriage, and fhews the parties fhall agree well, and not quarrel;\nbut, if they are in quartile or oppofition unto each other, it fhews much\nquarrelling\nDigitized by Go< gle O\nrigirw\nal from\nM C1AJ W\nr\n\\Q\nVDl ID I i r I I B B A B V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 319\nquarrelling and contention after marriage; and, if they be in quartile,\nconjun&ion, oroppofition, of the infortunes, in any places of the figure,\nit thews the fame. Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon\u2019s Tail, in the afcendant,\nfhews the querent to be imperious after marriage, and by his or her\nobftinacy will occafion much difcontent and trouble. But, if they are\npofited in the feventh houfe, the perfon whom the querent marries Will\nbe the occafion of the trouble and difcontent. Benevolent planets poffeff-\ning the feventh houfe, and a friendly reception between the lord of the\nfeventh and lord of the afcendant, denote good agreement after marriage.\nIf there happens to be a reception, through they are in quartile, it im\u00ad\nplies the fame.\nShall the Marriage be effected, or broken off?\nThe perfon, who enquires concerning the concluding or breaking off\nan intended marriage, muff have the lord of the afcendant and moon for\nfignificators; and the perfon quefited muft have the lord of the feventh\nand the planet from which the Moon is fep3rated. If the lord of the af\u00ad\ncendant or Moon be joined to the lord of the feventh, or in fextile or\ntrine to him, in any of his effential dignities, the marriage intended will\nbe brought to perfedion, particularly if it be from good houfes of the\nfigure. If a quartile or oppofition happens between the fignificators,\nand no reception, the intended marriage will be broken off, and come to\nnothing. When there is no afped between the fignificators, yet, if there\nbe any good tranflation of light between them, and this by a benevolent\nplanet, the marriage may be effected by a perfon reprefented by the houfe*\nthat planet is lord or governor of. So alfo, if the fignificator of both\nparties apply to a friendly afped, and, before the afped be made, an in\u00ad\nfortune interpofes his malicious rays, the marriage will be obftruded by\na perfon fignified by the houfe the interpofing planet is lord of. If the\ninterpofing planet be lord of the third, a kinfman of the querent\u2019s, or a\nneighbour or brother, fhall break off the bufinefs if he be lord of the\ntenth or fourth houfes, the father or mother of the querent will obftrud\nthe marriage intended $ and lb of the other houfes.\nOf Partnership, Law-Suits, W ar, &c.\nThe extent of this part will be better underftood by being digefted\ninto the following particulars:\n1.

But, if the lord of the feventh be more powerful in digni\u00ad\nties than the lord of the afcendant, and the feventh houfe better guarded\nby the prefence or rays of the fortunate ftars than the afcendant, the ad\u00ad\nverfary will overcome. If the lords of the afcendant and feventh be af\u00ad\nflicted by the infortunes, neither party will fucceed, but both will be\ninjured, if they go on with the fuit.

If the lord of the afcendant be in afpeft with\na good planet, and at the fame time the lord of the feventh be with an\nevil one, he may return home again ; but he will fuffer great prejudice\nbefore his return. Saturn being in the firft, or with the lord of the firft,\nprefages much lofs and damage to the querent by war. If Mars fhall be\nwith the lord of the firft, either by conjunction, quartile, or oppofition,\nand weak, and Saturn locally in the afcendant, the querent will be wound\u00ad\ned.

If the lord of the feventh be\nretrograde, the perfon abfconded fhall return again of his own accord,\nbefore he goes far from the querent's hoofe. The lord of the afcendant\nor Moon in good afjpeft with the lord of the feventh, and the lord of the\nfeventh in application, declares him to be seturning home again. If the\nfeventh do not apply, the querent may find him by enquiry. But if the\nfignificators behold each other by quartile or oppofition, or from no af-\npedtat all, it denotes the perfon will not return again. If the lord of the\nfeventh be in the third or ninth, it denotes the fame. If an horfe, ox, or\ncow, be Arayed, obferve the lord of the twelfth, and, if he be found re\u00ad\ntrograde, the Aray will return of his own accord; and obferve the fame\nrules as above, only changing the lord of the houfe. If the Moon tranf-\nfers the light of thedord-of the fugitive or Aray to the lord of the afcen\u00ad\ndant, it argues hopes of recovering them again. If (he transfers Mer\u00ad\ncury\u2019s light or virtue, it fignifies the fame. The Moon in good con\u00ad\nfiguration with Jupiter or Venus, or either of them caAing a good afpedfc\nto the afcendant, or its lord, from good Jioufes of the figure, fhew hopes\nof recovery. The lord of the feventh, either in the twelfth houfe of the\nfigure, or combuA, denotes the perfon to be under bonds of refiraint,\nperhaps in prifon j Mercury fo pofited argues the fame. When the pla\u00ad\nnet feparates from the houfe of the Moon, it (hews the Aray is taken in\u00ad\nto cuAody, and driven away and fold ; and, if any planet be found to\nfeparate from the lord of the fecund, it ihpws the fame. If the Moon,\nor fignificator of the Aray, &c. apply to the lord of the eighth from his\nafcendant, or be pofited in the eighth, it is dead. If the difpofitor of\nthe Moon, or fignificator of the hea&, be pofited in the eighth houfe, ap\u00ad\nplying to the quartile or oppofition of an infortune in the fourth, the\nfame. The lord of the fixth or twelfth, pofited in the fixth or twelfth,\nor in the ninth or tenth, argues the beafi Arayed to be either in the pound\nor in the cuAody of fome perfon. The lord of the feventh, or fixth,\nfortunated by the good heams of Jupiter or Venus, in the fecond, fifth\nor eleventh, houfe, or the Sun caAing a trine unto them, denotes they\nare likely to be found again.\nWhich Way are they gone ? and to what ?\nThe Moon, or fignificator of the fugitive or Aray, in the tenth houfe,\nAiews they are gone fouth; in the feventh, weA; in the fourth, north;\nOfFugitivesor S\nt\nr\na\ny\ns,fall theybefoundornot?\n2 in\nOriginal from\nM P A \/ Dl ID I I r I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O ' L O G Y . j\nin the afcendant, eaft.

Either of the\nfortunes in the afcendant, having dignities in the fecond houfe, or the\nMoon in the feventh, in fextile or trine to the lord of the afcendant, are\nvery certain arguments of recovering the thing or things loft. The Moon\nin the tenth, in trine to a planet in the fecond; or in the fecond, in trine\nto the lord of the fecond; the difpofitor of the Part of Fortune or the lord\nof the afcendant, in the fecond; the luminaries in trine to each other, or\nin trine to the cufp of the fecond houfe; or the lord of the fecond in the\neleventh or fourth houfes; are all arguments of recovery. The lord of\nthe eighth in the afcendant, or with the lord of the afcendant, denotes a\nrecovery of the goods loft ; arid Jupitec, Venus, or the Dragon\u2019s Head,\nin the eleventh houfe, give great hopes of the fame. The Moon, the\nPart of Fortune, or its difpofitor, or the lord of the fecond, in the eighth\nhoufe, are great arguments that the goods loft cannot be recovered.\nWhen both luminaries are under the earth, the thing loft is hard to be\nrecovered; and, if the fecond houfe or its lord be any way afflitled, ir\ndenotes the fame. But the greateft arguments of irrecovery are the pofi-\ntions of Saturn, Mars, or the Dragon\u2019s Tail, out of their effential digni\u00ad\nties, in the fecond houfe; or the lord of the fecond in combuftion, or\nin the eighth houfe; or the lord of the fecond in quartile or oppofition\nwith the lord of the eighth.

The angles of the figure\nfixed, and the fignificator of the thief fixed, in no afpedt with any planet,\nexcept the lord of the fubftance, or the difpofer of the Part of Fortune,\nwhom he afflidts, denote that only one perfon is concerned in the theft\n\u00a9r robbery.\nIsthe Theft committed by Strangers or Familiars ?\nThe luminaries beholding the afeendant, or its lord, or the lord of the\nfirft in the firft, in conjunction with the lord of the feventh, denote the\nthief to be a familiar, or one well known to the lofer.

If the lord of the afcendant\nand the Moon be free from the beams of the infortunes; or if no infor\u00ad\ntune, nor the Dragon's Tail, be pofited in the afcendant; they argue n\u00ae\ndanger to the querent, but (hew him to be of a long life.

Thus, finding all the fignificators free, the querent will\nlive as many years as there are degrees between the conjunction, quartile,\nor oppofition, of the lord of the eighth houfe and the lord of the afcen\u00ad\ndant. Or if, before the lord of the afcendant receives this affliction from\nthe lord of the eighth, he happens to be combuft of the Sun in the\nfourth, eighth, twelfth, or fixth, houfes, the degrees of diftanee between\nthe Sun and the fignificator will fhew the years the querent may live,\nbefore he fhall conclude this life. But, if the fignificators be afflicted,\neither by the infortunes, or by the lords of the fourth, fixth, eighth, or\ntwelfth, houfes, the querent\u2019s life will be of no very long continuance.\nIn the meafure of time, allow for degrees of diftanee, &cc. in moveable\nfigns, weeks ; in common figns, months and in fixed figns, years;\nwhich will fhew the length, according to natural caufes, of the querent\u2019s\nlife. When queftions of this nature are propounded, draw the figure\ninto a fpeculum, and direCt the fignificators as in a nativity; and when\nthe afcendant or Hyleg fhall come to any malicious direftion, according\nto the folar meafure of time, adjudge the perfon enquiring may be cut\noff from the land of the living.

Not being able to procure his nativity, I\ntook down the time of the day when the queftion was propofed, and,\nhaving redified it by a corred regulator, I immediately projeded the\nfollowing fcheme.\nMy\nDigitized by Go gle M C U \/ V r i D \/ Dl IP I i r I I R D A B V\n\fMy full: bufincfs was to examine the figure, to find whether it were\nradical, and fit to be adjudged, which I found to be the cafe, becaul'e\nthe lord of the afeendant and the lord of the hour are of one nature and\ntriplicity; and the fignificator of the querent exactly deferibed his perfon,\nwhich is of a middle filature, fanguine complexion, and of an acute un\u00ad\ndemanding, denoted by Mercury\u2019s pofition in the fign Aries, the houfe\nof Mars. The Moon being in oppofition to the fun, (hews him to have\na mark or fear near the left eye; which was alfo true ; and therefore, as\nI found all circumftances to concur in proving the quefiiion to be well\nand ferioufly grounded, and free from all impofition, I gave him my\njudgment upon the figure as follows.\nThe princely fign Leo, the querent\u2019s fignificator, occupies the afeen\u00ad\ndant j and the Sun, the lord thereof, and giver of life, is pofited near\nhis meridian altitude in the medium cceli, and in the fign Aries, his\nhoufe of exaltation, ftrong, powerful, and in full dignity, free from the\nevil rays of the lords of the fixth, eighth, fourth, or fecond, houfes,\nwhich neither impedite the Sun nor the afeendant with any evil afpe<ft.\nBut the Moon, lady of the twelfth, is in oppofition to the Sun, making\nat the fame time a quartile mundane afpedt with the afeendant, and a fex-\ntile afpedt with Saturn in the zodiac; from which pofitions I inferred the\nfollowing particulars.\nThe afflidtion of the lord of the afeendant, by the oppofition of the\nMoon in Libra, the houfe of Venus, and Venus difpofitor of the Moon\nin her own houfe, and in the feminine fign Taurus, going to a femifex-\ntile with the Sun, denotes that he will receive fome confiderable injury\nfrom a female connexion, now exifting under the fpecious pretence of\nfriendfhip and fond attachment; and this is declared by the Moon being\nlady of the twelfth, the houfe of private enemies, which difpofes of the\npart of fortune, and thereby indicates that he will lofe fome part of his\nfortune by her means.\nThe Moon\u2019s mundane quartile afpedl to the afeendant, in an airy fign,\ndeclares that he will be attacked with a fevere fit of the wind cholic,\nor fome dangerous complaint in the bowels and reins; but it will not\nprove fatal to him, becaufe the Sun, the lord of his afeendant, is more\nftrong and powerful, and in greater dignities, than the afflicting planets;\nand therefore, according to natural efficient caufes, they will prevail over\nall fubordinate efte&s.\nFrom\nDigitized by Go*, ole Original from -\nK I P W V n R k ' Dl I P I I r I I R P A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 33 9\nFrom a confideration of thofe parts of the figure which relate to the\ncircumftances of his paft life, I informed him he had improved his for\u00ad\ntune, and been fuccefsful in fome important voyage, becaufe the Dra\u00ad\ngon\u2019s Head is fituated in his ninth houfe; but that he had lately fuftvred\ngreatly by a violent hurricane, that threatened deftrudtion or fhipwreck ;\nwhich is denoted by the oppofition of Saturn to the Part of Fortune, and\nthe Moon having lately l'eparated from an oppofition with Mercury, lord\nof the third houfe, where the Dragon\u2019s Tail is pofited. This circum-\nftance I had the pleafure of hearing him acknowledge to be true; and\nthat the ftorm arofe only eight days before the ftiip came into port.\nHe requefted me to afcertain the time when the above illnefs would\nhappen. I accordingly took the number of degrees between the Sun and\nMoon, by fubtracfting the lefs fum from the greater; and found the\ndiftance to be eleven degrees fifty-nine minutes. I then fought the\nMoon\u2019s latitude, and found it one degree thirty-three minutes fouth,\nwhich, added to the above, make thirteen degrees thirty-two minutes;\nand, as the fignificators are in moveable figns, I computed the time by\nweeks and days, and predicted this illnefs would befal him about the\n20th of July following ; and that, after he fliould be reftored to health\nagain, he would go on, without fuftaining any other ferious indifpofition,\nuntil the fixty-ninth year of his age > about which time I conceive the\nfunctions of life will be naturally extinguifhed, by a complication of in\u00ad\nfirmities.\nI have lately had the pleafure of convening with the gentleman on the\nfubjedt of this queftion. He informed me, that towards the middle of\nJuly, 1783, he was attacked with a kind of bilious complaint in his\nftomach, which brought on violent fits of the cholic. That, towards\nthe latter end of the fame month, he found an obftrudtion in his bowels,\nand his phyfician declared it next to a miracle that his life was faved.\nHe now appears to be in perfedt health, and has funk a confiderable fum\nof money in life annuities, which he declares was done in confequence of\nthe verity he found in thefe predictions.\nQU ESTIO N II. On the FA TE of a SH IP at SEA.\nIn the year 1781, a gentleman called upon me who had a confiderable\nfhare in a privateer, which had been completely fitted out and fent to\nfea a long time before, and the proprietors could not obtain the leaf!\ninformation of her. He therefore requefted me, if in my power, to give\nhim fome probable account of what had befallen her. After convincing\nmyfelf the queftion was radical, and no trick or impolition intended.\nNo. 17. 4 M which\nOriginal from\nM P A \/ V f l D ^ Dl IDI \\r l i d d\nDigitized by Google\n\fwhich is always necelfiry to be carefully enquired into by the rules al\u00ad\nready laid down for that purpofe, I proceeded to give my judgment on the\nfollowing figure, rectified to the precife time the queftion was propound\u00ad\ned.\nHere the afeendant and the Moon are fignificators of the fhip ; and\nVenus, becaufe the fign Taurus, the houfe of Venus, is on the afeendant,\nis fignificatrix of the crew; and Mercury, with the Part of Fortune,\ndenote her ftores and all the other materials on-board her. The (hip it-\nfelf appears weil found and fubftantial, but not a fwift failer, as is demon-\nftrated by an earthy fign poffefling the cufp of the afeendant, and the\nfituation of the Dragon\u2019s Head in five degrees of the fame fign. The\nplanet Mars is fignificator of the enemy.\nNow the Moon, which reprefents the fhip, being fituated in the eighth\nhoufe, the houfe of death and difappointment, and at the fame time be-\nfieged by the two malefic planets Saturn and Mars, denotes her to be\noverpowered by the enemy* Mars* lord of the feventh, the houfe of\nopen\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM C l \/ l \/ V O D V D l ID I i r I I D D A D U\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 341\nopen enemies, being pofited with all his dignities therein; and in re\u00ad\nception of Jupiter, lord of the enemy\u2019s houfe of fubftance; and being\nalfo difpofitor of the Moon, Mercury, and Venus, which reprefent the\nShip and^crew, obvioufly declares them to be in the hands of the enemy.\nThe fignificators, being pofited in fiery figns, indicate an engagement to\nhave taken place; but the fuperior Strength of the malefic rays of the\ninfortunes declare it to have been of Short duration, and of very unequal\nforce. The crew being represented by Venus, who is difpofed of by\nMars in the twelfth houfe, the hrrufe of imprifonment and affli&ion,\nplainly Shews them to be imprifoned in the enemy\u2019s country. And as\nMercury is retrograde, and Situated alfo in the twelfth houfe, with the\nMoon\u2019s fortunate node, it is apparent that the Ship and iiores will never\nbe reftorcd to the owners, but will be appropriated to the ufe of the cap-\ntors, or difpofed of for their advantage. The Moon\u2019s pofition in the\neighth houfe declares the Ship to have been taken at a confiderable dis\u00ad\ntance from home: and Sagittarius poSTeSIing the cufp of the eighth, which\nis a fouth-weft fign, and fituated in the fouth-weft part of the heavens,\ndenotes the capture to have been made in a fouth-weft part of the world.\nThe querent left me with Strong hopes of finding this judgment erro\u00ad\nneous ; and appeared fo extremely averfe to believe there could be any\ntruth in it, (becaufe perhaps it operated fo much againft his own intereft,)\nthat I would not fuffer him to leave the room until he had promifed\nupon his honour to let me know the refult. Accordingly, in about fix\nmonths afterwards, I received a Short note from him, informing me that\nthe owners had received advice from the captain of the privateer, that he\nhad fallen in with a French frigate of twenty-four guns, which being\nvaftly fuperior to him, he was obliged, after a Short refiftance, to ftrike\nhis colours, and was carried prifoner, with the reft of the crew, into\nFrance.\nQU ESTIO N III. Of an ABSENT SON, whether DEAD or ALIVE.\nA poor woman applied to me in the greateft diftrefs of mind, on ac\u00ad\ncount of her fon, who had turned out wild, and went to fea without the\nconfent of his friends. He had been abfent a confiderable time, with\u00ad\nout ever once fo far refledting on the dilconfolate fituation of his parent,\nas to be induced to addrefs a line to her, to remove her anxiety, or to\nSlate his own profpedts and purfuits. It was the woman\u2019s conftant practice\nto make enquiry after him among the feafaring people, till at length She\nheard an imperfect ftory of fome engagement abroad, in which her fon\nwas\nOriginal from\nm c u \/ v n c k ' d i m i i r i i q b a p v\nDigitized by \u00ab q 1 c\n\f342 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nwas reported to be killed. Upon this unpleafant news, the requefted\nme to inform her, by the rules of Aftrology, whether her fon was d; ad\nor alive, or whether the account the had heard was true or fall'e. Her\nuneafinefs of mind was too apparent for me to doubt her fincerity, or to\nfuppofe the queftion not fit to be adjudged, and therefore I erected this\nfigure, and gave my opinion thereon as follows:\nIn this figure Virgo rifes upon the afcendant, and Mercury, lord\nthereof, and fignificator of the querent, is pofited in the twelfth houfe,\nthe houfe of affliction and forrow. The fifth houfe of the figure is here\nconfidered as her fon\u2019s firft or afcendant, and Saturn, lord thereof, is\nhis fignificator, and is pofited in the fourth angle, or imura cceli, which\nreprefents the grave and termination of all things. Saturn is alfo in\nconjunction with the Part of Fortune in the fourth, both or which are\ndifpofed of by Jupiter, and Jupiter by M ars; which malefic planet\npofleffes the fon\u2019s firft houfe or afcendant in his exaltation, and in oppo-\nfition to the Sun and Venus in the feventh, which is the houfe of open\nenemies and war.\n2 From\nigitized by G o o g l e\nOriginal from\nMPUii v n p t ' D i i m i r i i r r a r v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . \u2019 343\nFrom thefe configurations I drew the inferences following: That Mer\u00ad\ncury, the querent\u2019s fignificator, by being pofited in the twelfth houfe,\nplainly Ihewed her fears were too well grounded. That Saturn, figni\u00ad\nficator of the quefited, and the Part of Fortune, being both difpofed of by\nJupiter, and this planet dilpofed of by Mars, indicates all their benevo\u00ad\nlent effefls to be deftroved by the malignant influence of this infortune.\nMars being in the fon\u2019s afcendant, in his exaltation, and in oppofition to\nSol, is a ftrong argument of a violent death ; the kind and manner of\nwhich are thus delcribed. Saturn, his fignificator,'is pofited in the fiery\nfign Sagittarius ; and Leo, which occupies the cufp of his eighth, and\nAries the cufp of his fourth, are alio of the fiery triplicity ; the Sun,\nthe giver of life, and light of time, is pofited in the watery fign Cancer,\ndifpofed of by the Moon in the watery fign Pifces, and the Moon by\nJupiter in the watery fign Scorpio; and the whole of their influences are\ntransferred to the fiery planet Mars, in his afcendant. From thefe cir-\ncumftances it became obvious to me that the youth was no longer in ex-\niftence; and that his death happened upon the water, by means of fome\nfatal warlike inftrument, and in fome defperate engagement with an open\nenemy.\nThe querent then alked me if I could give her any fatisfaftory account\nhow long ago this happened. I took down the degrees and minutes of\nthe two principal fignificators, viz. the Sun and rs, and fubtra&ed\nthe one from the other, which gave four degrees five minutes for the re\u00ad\nmainder ; and this being converted into time by the rules before laid\ndown for moveable figns, in which the above fignificators were pofited, I\ninformed her the accident had befallen her fon fomewhat more than a\nmonth before fhe heard the news of it. Some time afterwards a fhip ar\u00ad\nrived with an account of this engagement, which happened on the coaft\nof France, and confirmed the whole of this judgment.\nQ U E S T I O N IV.

When I had mentioned thefe particulars, he frankly told me\nhis fhip was under failing orders, and he expedted to be called on-board\nevery hour.\n1\nTo afcertain the time when thefe riches fhould be acquired, I parti\u00ad\ncularly noticed the application of the Moon to the lord of the afeendant,\nand found them nineteen degrees ditlant from a pirtile trine afpedt. But\nthe Moon, being fwift in motion, with three degrees north latitude, and\nMercury having no latitude, I dedudted three degrees from the Moon\u2019s\nplace, which I fet down at twelve degrees; and then by fubtradting\ntwelve degrees from twenty-eight degrees three minutes, which is Mer\u00ad\ncury\u2019s place, there remains fixteen degrees three minutes ; which, as\nthe Moon is in a moveable fign, and Mercury in a common fign, is equal\nto fixteen weeks, or thereabout; and therefore I concluded this good\nfortune would happen to him in nearly that diftance of time. And I have\nfince had the fatisfadlion of hearing, from the gentleman\u2019s own mouth,\nthat this predidtion was literally verified by the capture of a rich prize\nwithin the time fpecified.\nQ U ESTIO N V.

Finding her\nperfeftly fincere and earneft in her wilhes, and the queftion truly radical,\nI gave her my judgment as follows :\nla\nOriginal from\nm c v m v n o i r d i i q i i r i i d d a d v\nD\nicjiti. * C o o o l e\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 357\nIn this figure the Sun is fignificator of the lady ; and Saturn, lord of\nthe feventh houfe, is fignificator of the gentleman. It mult alfo be ob-\nferved that in this, and in all queltions relative to matrimony. Mars and -\nthe Sun are the natural fignificators of a woman\u2019s marriage; and Venus\nand the Moon are thofe of a man\u2019s. Now Saturn, the gentleman\u2019s figni\u00ad\nficator, is remarkably well pofited in the fifth houfe, and has Venus\nwithin his orb, applying to him by conjunction ; which is a very pow\u00ad\nerful indication that his affections are fincere and honourable, and that\nhis mind is fully bent to the marriage-ftate. The Sun likewife, being\nin a Textile afpeCt with Mars, the lady\u2019s fignificator of marriage, plainly\nfhews her inclination to matrimony to be flrongly fixed, and her affec\u00ad\ntions perfectly fincere.\nThe next thing to be confidered, is, whether there be any fruflration,\nor impediting afpeCt between thefe fignificators; and, I find the Moon\nand Venus, the gentleman\u2019s fignificators of marriage, are applying to a\nquartile afpeCt with each other. This is an evident proof that the mar\u00ad\nriage is prolonged by the interference of fome other woman, of this gen\u00ad\ntleman\u2019s intimate acquaintance, becaufe the afpeCt is made in a feminine\nfign ; but as the Moon, in feparating from Venus, applies to a perfiCt\ntrine with Mars, the querent\u2019s principal fignificator of marriage, and\nalfo to a Textile of the Sun, her natural fignificator in the figure, it totally\nremoves the evil effeCts of the malefic afpeCt, and leaves the path free and\nunobftruCted to the gates of Hymen. This opinion is greatly flrengthen-\ned by confidering the mode in which their fignificators are feverally dif\u00ad\npofed. Saturn difpofes of the Sun, who is pofited in the term of Venus;\nand Venus, Saturn, and the Moon, are all difpofed of by the benevolent\nplanet Jupiter, who is himfelf difpofed of by Mars, the principal figni\u00ad\nficator of this lady\u2019s marriage, and who thus triumphs over every obftacle\nto the celebration of their nuptials. I therefore could not hefitate in de\u00ad\nclaring to the lady, in the fulleft and rood fatisfaCtory terms, that the\ngentleman who courted her had a fincere and tender regard for her; and\nthat, though fome circumflances might have happened rather unfavour\u00ad\nable to her wilhes, yet Ihe might rell perfectly allured that he was the\nman allotted to be her hulband.\nApparently well fatisfied with thefe declarations, Ihe proceeded to en\u00ad\nquire in what length of time this defirable circumftance might come to\npafs. To gratify her wilhes in this particular, I referred again to the\nfigure, where the Moon, the gentleman\u2019s principal fignificator of mar\u00ad\nriage, wants upwards of eleven degrees of forming 3 perfect Textile afpeCt\n2 with\nOriginal from\nM P A \/ v n e Y Dl I P I I r I I D D A D V\nDigitized by Google\n\fu\nu\ni\ni\nidi11,\no\nu\nu\ny\ni\ne\n-\nu\ni\ny\ni\nu\n\/\ni\ne\nu\n\/\n11LLp:\n\/\n\/w\nw\nw\n.\ni\nidii\nn\nu\nu\nb\ni\n.\nu\ni\ny\n\/c\nie\nt\n.\ne\nb\nb\n_\nu\nb\ne\n-\nf\nf\n-\np\nu\n-\ny\nu\nu\ny\nit\n;\n358 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nwith theSun,(the lord of the afcendant,)and the fame to Mars, her figni-\nficator of marriage; and therefore, by converting the degrees into tmie\nby the rule heretofore given, I fixed her marriage at about the end of\nthree months, alluring her it would not exceed that time. The event\nhas fully proved the truth of the prediction; the lady and gentleman have\nboth done me the honour of a call fince the celebration of their nuptials,\nand I found they were married precifely at the time I had predicted ; I\nhave likewife the additional pleafure to find, that my aflurances to the\nlady were productive of frelh efteem and clofer attachment to the man of\nher heart, and they now live a pattern of conjugal felicity.\nQ JL T E S T IO N XI. On W A R and B A T T L E .\nDuring the trial of a certain noble Commander in Chief, at the Go\u00ad\nvernor\u2019s houfe in Portfmouth, a company of gentleman one day called\nupon me, and requefted I would take down the pofitions of the planets\nat the time that much-talked-of aCtion commenced, and give them my\njudgment upon it, according to the rules of planetary influence. W il\u00ad\nling to oblige them in a matter which I conceived could be of no pre\u00ad\njudice to any party, fince no advantage could be taken from i t ; and alfo\ndeeming it a fit fubjeCt whereby to manifeft the fublimity and excellence\nof this art, I hefitated not to promife them every information in my\npower. For this purpofe I ereCled my figure, not to the time this\nqueftion was propounded, for, it related to an event that had long been\npafied by, and not to any matter that was hereafter expeded to happen\nand therefore I projected the fcheme to correfpond with the exaCt time\nwhen this extraordinary aftion commenced, and at which moment the\nheavenly bodies were under the remarkable configurations delineated in.\nthe following fcheme:\nThe\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM C \\ A \/ v n p f c ' Dl I DI 1C I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 3 9 5\nThe afcendant, the Moon and Venus, reprefent the Britilh fleet ;\nMars and Aries denote that of the enemy. The firft thing to be con-\nfidered is the afpedt thefe two fignificators bear to one another, which is\na partile Textile, a well-known indication of imperfedt love j and, as it\nfhews that Mars and Venus have not in themfelves an inveterate hatred,\nfo it imports that the two commanders in chief did not behold each other\nin an afpedt of perfedt and direful malignancy and wrath. Venus, lady\nof the afcendant, is polited with Jupiter in his fall, a benevolent planet\nand a lover of peace; and as he is in this figure lord of the third houfe,\nand within fifty degrees of the afcendant, it indicates that both com\u00ad\nmanders have a defire to promote peace, by afting principally upon the\ndefenfivc, and by guarding and protedting their refpedtive coafts, without\na defire of any clofe or decifive adtion, or of venturing to any great dif-\ntance from home.\nI\nThe cool, cautious, deliberate, planet Saturn, is fitua.ed in the firft\nhoufe, and indicates not fo much a defire for hot and precipitate adtion, *\n.No* ib\u00ab 4 R\nGo gle Original frorr\u00bb\nI\n\f360 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nas for felf-prefervation, or the protection of national wealth $ and this is\nplainly exemplified in the Britifh admiral\u2019s watchfulnefs and care in\ncovering and protecting the homeward-bound India fleet ; as well as in\nthe French admiral\u2019s retiring after he found his views upon that rich\nand unguarded flota were Completely fruflrated. The pofitioft of Mer\u00ad\ncury, being combuft of the Sun, and difpofer of the Moon, Venus, and\nJupiter, and lord alfo of the twelfth houfe, the houfe of private enmity\nand malice, indicates private rancour and enmity in a fubordinate com\u00ad\nmander j and, as Mercury is pofited between the two fignificators, Venus\nand Mars, evilly dignified, and combuft, fo he denotes the perfon reprc-\nfented by him will infallibly be governed by malevolent principles, and\nufe his influence to retard the objeCt of the bufinefs in hand. The truth\nof this indication has, I think, been too well eftablifhed to need any fur\u00ad\nther illuftration from me*\nThe enemy, as I have before obferved, is reprcfented by Mars, who\nis pofited in the tenth houfe, the houfe of honour, and in the fign of\nhis triplicity, but in the dignities of Jupiter; and this fhews that the\nenemy would as much as poflible avoid clofe aCtion, but would take the\nadvantage to fhift from fighting; and Mars, being in his fall deprives\nthe enemy of their honour, and clearly proves, that if a clofe and well-\nconneCted aftion had been kept up, and continued without ceafing, a\ndecifive victory would have followed on the part of the Englifh, becaufe\nJupiter is in conjunction with Venus and the Moon, which difpofes of\nM ars; but, as Mars has the watery triplicity afiigned him, he fhews the\nenemy fhould take the advantage of that element to run away.\nWe find alfo, in the above figure, a quartile afpeCt of Saturn and Mer\u00ad\ncury, a configuration which is always known to produce tempeftuous\nweather and ftrong winds, and this we find was the cafe off Ufhant at the\ntime of the above engagement. The pofition of Mercury in the firft,\nwhere Saturn is fituated, plainly indicates thefe winds to be highly con\u00ad\nducive to the fafety of the enemy, but of dangerous tendency to the\nBritifh fleet, in cafe of a purfuit.\nAfter duly weighing the natural influences and eflfeCts of the configu\u00ad\nrations in this figure, which are the true and genuine flate of the hea\u00ad\nvens at the time of the engagement, I hefitated not to declare, that both\ncommanders had a ftronger inclination to preferve peace than to break it,\nand that a clofe connected and decifive aCtion was not to happen, owing\nto Saturn being in the afeendant on the fide of the Englifh, with two\nmuch thought and deliberation; and to Mars being in his fall in the\n2 dignities\nDigitized by Google Original from\nV f l D k ' Dl ID I I r I I R B A B V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 361\ndignities of Jupiter, on the part of the French, which declares their\nwatchfulness to run away.

In this moment it is that the\nftars begin to aft and operate their influence upon the new-born infant,\nby the power or intervention of thofe angels who rule and govern the\nconftellations then level with the horizon, or that afcend upon the ho-\nrofcope, according to that faying of St. Jerome, in his comment upon\nthe eighteenth chapter of St. Matthew, where he fays. Great is the dig\u00ad\nnity o ffouls, fo r every one at their firfi coming into the world have an an\u00ad\ngel appointedfor their cujlody and fafety. And, as it is from thefe confi\u00ad\ngurations that we are enabled to point out the incidents of the native\u2019s\nfuture life, fo is it abfolutely neceffary that the very inftant of birth\nffiould be well and minutely ascertained, in order to arrive at corre&nefs\nand certainty in thefe fpeculations. It muft be obvious to every one\nthat the celeftial bodies are in perpetual motion, and therefore every\nquarter of an hour muft confiderably vary their pofition ; as does alfo\ndifferent parallels from any one given point of the heavens; and hence\nit is that the latitude, as well as the true time of birth, becomes fo\nabfolutely neceffary in calculating or bringing up the directions of a\nnativity.\nBy knowing the place of birth, the latitude is eafily afcertained ;\nbut to determine the precife time of a native\u2019s emerging from the womb\nis a circumftance that has been always found difficult and precarious ;\nnot only on account of the inattention of nurfes and midwives to this\nmolt interefting event, but alfo by reafon of the difference and uncer\u00ad\ntainty of almoft all clocks, watches, and dials, in reference to the\nSun. Wherefore the ancient profeffors of this art, to remove the\nerrors in the common or eftimate time of birth, have contrived fe-\nveral ways of rectifying a nativity ; and have given l'uch rules for this\npurpofe, that the true time of birth may be thereby correctly afcertain\u00ad\ned. This rectification may be effected three different ways ; firft, by\nthe Trutinam Hermetis,or Trutine of Hermes; fecondly, by the Ani-\nmoder of Ptolomy ; and, thirdly, by the natural accidents of the native.\nThefe three methods I ffiall explain fully, when I come to treat of the\nrectifications of nativities ; fuffice it here to fay, that the method moftly\nin ule, and which is found liable to the leaft error, particularly in the\nmade p l a in and e a s y .\n\/ genitures\nDigitized by Go*, sle Original from\nm p a i v n D P D i i m i r i i d d a d v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 391\ngenitures of gro^vn perfons, is that of rectifying by fuch accidents as\nmight have befallen them during their pad. life.\nAs the do&rine of nativities is the very eflence of Aftrology, and the\nprincipal criterion by which mankind will judge of the utility and rea-\nfonablenefs of the fcience, it will be requilite for me in this place to be\nas plain and circumftantial as poflible. It cannot be unentertaining, nor\nwholly ufelefs, even to a common reader, much lefs to thofe who mean to\nRudy the heart, to know the true grounds upon which this part of the\nfcience is founded; together with thofe afpeCts or configurations at\nbirth, from which our predictions are framed j and the time alfo when\ntheir influence and effefts will vifibly operate upon the body or affairs\nof the native. In elucidating this fubject, I fhall be principally guided\nby the Quadripartite of the great Ptolomy ; the truth and excellency\nof whofe doCtrine the experience of many ages, and the obfervations of\nthe moft intelligent profeflors of this art, have fully eftablifhed and\nconfirmed.\nIt is manifeft to the moft fuperficial obferver, that a certain fecret\npower is diffufed through all things that are near the earth, accordirfg\nto the nature and properties of the firmament, and circumambient\nair, and to the power and influence of the luminaries and other ce-\nleftial bodies. The Sun being the fuperior luminary and the foun\u00ad\ntain of life, governs all things that bear relation to the earth, not only\nby varying the feafons, and bringing to perfection the feeds' of animals,\nand the fruitfulnefs of plants, the flowing of waters and the mutation\nof bodies, but alfo the changes of the day, of heat and moifture, of\ndrinefs and cold, as it hath refpeCl to the meridian, or mid-heaven.\u2014\nThe Moon alfo, being neareft to the earth, diftils down an amazing in\u00ad\nfluence, by which things animate and inanimate are affeCted and changed.\nRivers are augmented and diminifhed according to her lig h t; the tides\nvary as fhe rifes and fets; plants and animals, in whole or in part, ir-\ncreafe and decreafe with her. In the fame manner the ftars, fixed and\nerratic, as they keep on their uniform courfe, caufe many appearances\naround us, for they produce cold and heat, and wind and rain, by\nwhich alfo things on earth are fuitably governed ; and their mutual con-\nfiguration&\u201eas..their influences co-operate with or oppofe one another,\nproduce variations accordingly.\nThe power of the Sun is on all hands admitted to be moft ,\nas it is obvioufly moft univerfal. The other heavenly bodies, according\nNo. 20. 5 B to\nDigitized by Google Original from\nmc va\/ v n nv di i m ir i i d r a d v\n\f392 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nto the variety of their afpefts with the Sun, unite with, or refid, his in\u00ad\nfluence, agreeable to the nature and force of fuch afpefts. This hap\u00ad\npens mod frequently, and mod forcibly, with the Moon, at all the\nchanges. But thefe affedtions in the dars operate more obfcurely, and\nemploy longer time, according to their declination, or as they appear or\ndifappear in our horizon. Hence then, by the rules of nature, and the\ntedimony of our own reafon and experience, it mud be admitted, that\nof all the planets, the influence of the Sun is the mod powerful j and\nthat the influence of the other planets have mod energy, when the\nbeams of the Sun co-operate with them. The Moon likewife, by rea\u00ad\nfon of her fwiftnefs, and proximity to the earth, modifies and conveys\nthefe influences to fublunary bodies, with a force fuperior to all the\nother dars. And thefe influences are always mod powerful, and mod\nvifible in their effedls, when this mediation of the Moon is exercifed in\nconveying the influences of the dars to the Sun, or of the Sun to the\nother dars, and thence to the earth. But, in defining thefe varying pro\u00ad\nperties and effeils, particular regard mud be had to the latitude, decli\u00ad\nnation, rifing, and fetting, of the dars, both fixed and erratic, el'pecially\nthofe which approach neared to the ecliptic.\nWhoever contemplates thefe premifes, and attentively obferves the\nafpedts, will find that not only conjoined bodies are fubjedt to the confi\u00ad\ngurations of the dars, but alfo the buddings and perfedtion of feeds are\nframed and formed according to the quality with which the heavenly\nmatter and circumambient air is endued. The obfervant hulbandman\nand fhepherd preconjedture the proper feafons for fecd-fowing, planting,\nand procreation of animals, by confulting the date of the winds and\nthe face of the fky. The fkilful mariner likewife prepares againd the\ndangers of an approaching dorm by fimilar obfervations j but they are\nfrequently deceived for want of better experience, and an adequate know\u00ad\nledge of the courfes and effects of the heavenly bodies, which, when ex\u00ad\nactly underdood, conduce to an almod certain prefcience herein. For\nit is found, that he who corredtly knows the motions of the dars, and\ntheir configurations with the Sun and Moon, and is not ignorant of the\ntimes, nor the place, nor the afpedts, and is well lkilled in the Ample\nways of nature, can admirably foretel, in any feafon, the proper date\nand temperature of the air ; as that it will be hotter and-Mgj^^#? or colder 'fo\nor drier, according to the nature and properties of the refpedtive rays\nof the dars and Moon configurated with the Sun. And, as thefe fpecula-\ntions are founded upon the mod Ample principles of nature, as that the\nSun is hot and dry, and the Moon is cold and moid, and the obferva\u00ad\ntions\nDigitized by Go< gle Original from\nMCVA\/ DIIDI Ir I I D R A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 393\ntions deduced herefrom are feldom known to vary ; fo, by fimilar qua\u00ad\nlities and obfervations, and by rules equally well founded, vve obtain a\nlegal and an extenfive prefcience refpetting man. For, from the natural\nRate of the ambient and heavenly matter at the time of the conftruCtion\nof the body, it is eafy to know in general, the quality and temparature of\neach perfon born ; that fuch fhall be the formation of his body, and\nfuch the difpofition of his mind, and fuch the future events, advantage\u00ad\nous or difadvantageous, of his life, according to the ftate of the heavens\nat that particular time, whether qualified for the produ&ion of fuch a\ntemper, or whether inimical to it. Thus, a prefage is not only poffible\nby the laws of nature, but proper and neceflary to the wifdom and well\u00ad\nbeing of fociety.\nThe errors of thofe who do not underftand the fundamental princi\u00ad\nples of this learning have doubtlefs afforded ftrong and plaufible reafons\nto the bulk of mankind for difcarding it altogether, and for confidering\nthofe events which others have more fuccefsfully afcertained, to be the\neffefts of mere chance. But furely a dofirine is not to be rejected, be-\ncaufe fome of its followers are vicious or ignorant. In this fpeculation,\nabove all others, reafonable allowances fhould be made, as well for the\nweaknefs of human comprehenfion, as for the great and undefinable ex\u00ad\ntent of the contemplation. Much depends upon the ability of the phy-\nfician, in modifying and proportioning his prefcription, no^ only to cor-\nrefpond with the ftate of the difeafe, but alfo with the temperature and\nconftitution of the patient. In the fubjedl under confideration, a judg\u00ad\nment no lefs fagacious is abfolutely neceflary j becaufe the quality of the\nheavenly matter is often conjectural, and the mixtures of different af-\npedts and influences are fometimes fo complicated, that the brighteft\nunderftanding can fcarcely arrange them with precifion.\nBut the confideration of Nativities, in points which relate to the par\u00ad\nticular temper and difpofition of refpective perfons, hath other caufefr\nin nature too apt to be forgotten, or perhaps lightly paffed over as cir-\ncumftances of no moment. But it is undeniably true, and muft be ad\u00ad\nmitted on all hands, that the place of birth will often make confidera-\nble difference in thofe who are born ; and though the feed be the fame\nfrom which they are procreated, and though the conftitution of the\nheavens be the fame, yet the diverfities of countries wherein they are\nborn will naturally produce a difference in their bodies and minds. Be-\nfides this, a different education and cuftom will form a different difpo\u00ad\nfition and manner of life j as docs alfo the different fituation or claifes\n1 in\nDigitized by Goc>sle O\nriginal from\nM P U f v n o ^ d 1 1d 1 1r 1 1\n\f394 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nin which mankind are brought up, and to which they are accuftomed.\nTherefore he who does not attentively confider each of thefe diftintlions,\nand unite them judicioully with the caufes produced by the ambient and\nheavenly matter, will meet with great uncertainty in his conclufions.\nFor, although the power of heaven is confeffedly the greateft, and with\nthefe all the others arc conceived as adjuvant caufes, yet they do not al\u00ad\nways alfume the circumambient matter as a concaufe ; confequently\nthofe who attempt to predidl from the motion of the heavenly bodies\nalone, without due reference to- thefe confiderations, will entail contempt\nupon themfelves, and difgrace upon the fcience.\nBut that aftrological predi&ions are pofiible, and to be defined with\ngreat precifion, when properly managed, is an aflertion moft true,\nand which, I flatter myfelf, I have already made manifcft. It remains,\ntherefore, that we fpeak of the advantages of this benevolent difpenfa-\ntion of Providence j for, if a foreknowledge be advantageous or necef-\nfary to the fafety and future happinefs of the foul, what can be more fo in\nrelped of the body, fince it affords not only temporal -delight, happinefs,\nand pleafure, but enables us to underftand things both divine and hu\u00ad\nman ? Whatever happens in the courfe of nature, either necefTirily, or\naccidentally that materially aflfeds our profperity or adverfity, and either\nprolongs life or deftroys it, if they happen fuddenly and unexpectedly,\nconfound with fear, or tranfport with joy; but, if they are foreknown,\nthey fortify the mind by fuch foreknowledge, and prepare it for fuftain-\ning the beft or worft occurrences with calmnefs and fcrenity. In what\nrelpect therefore is man fuperiorto the irrational part of the creation, if he\ncannot bear to know the hour of his diffolution ? The terms of our ex-\niftence, as every day\u2019s experience repeatedly (hews, are that we muft\nfuffer death. Where then, to minds fraught with reafon and integrity,\ncan be the horror, thediftrefs, or calamity, of knowing the time when\nthat certain event fhall take place ? To men of a virtuous habit, fuch\na knowledge muft be invaluable ; and to thofe of lefs fcrupulous prin\u00ad\nciples, it cannot be unwelcome, provided reafon or philofophy make up\nany part of their conftitufion. To men of the moft exemplary conduct,\nit affords fit opportunity of adjufting their temporal concerns, and re\u00ad\nlieves them under the diftreffes and afflictions of this life, by afcertain-\ning the period of their fufferings, and by giving them hopes of retribu\u00ad\ntion and reward in that which will fucceed. To the inconfiderate and\nworldly minded, it not only gives the fame advantages, but begets in\nthem a proper fenfe of the more important concerns of that endlefs ftate\nef exiftence, \u201c from whence no traveller returns.\u201d For thefe grand\npurpofes\nO\nriginal from\nV f l D k ' Dl ID I I r I I D D A D V\nDigitized by Goi. gle\n\fOF A S T R O L O G Y . 395\npurpofes chiefly, the all-wife and benevolent hand of Providence feems\nto have pointed out to mankind the Art of Prefcience and Prediction ;\nnot to fay any thing of the innumerable lefs important concerns of hu\u00ad\nman affairs, which may oftentimes afford fingular advantage and happi-\nnefs to individuals, as well as to ftates and focieties, by being thus time\u00ad\nly forewarned of what fhall hereafter come to pafs. And furely I need\nnot mention a ftronger inftance of the advantages of prefcience, than\nwhat will naturally arife from the obfervation of every man of experience\nwhen he looks back upon the occurrences of his paft life, and recollects\nbut half the Ioffes and inconveniences he has fuflained, only for want of\nthat foreknowledge in worldly affairs which the art of prediction fupplies.\n* W e are not however to believe, that the accidents and events of life\nfo befal men, as though a law were fet over them by fome indiffoluble\ncaufe from above, by which they are of neceflity brought to pafs, no\nother caufe being able to oppofe or prevent them. It were unphilofo-\nphical and abfurd thus to imagine; for the motion of the heavenly bo\u00ad\ndies is immutable by divine law, and the mutation^of earthly things is\ndifpofed of and revealed by a natural generation and order, which the fu-\nperior caufe follows by accident. It is alfo to be obferved, that many\nthings happen to man, not only by reafon of the natural and proper qua\u00ad\nlity of the heavenly matter, but alfo by the operation of fome more uni-\nverfal caufes ; as by great mutations and mixtures of the elements, plagues\nand peftilences, and floods and conflagrations, are produced, by which\nmultitudes are at once fwept away, and perifh under one common fata\u00ad\nlity. Thus greater caufes always overcome the lefs, and the ftronger\nthe weaker; and, whenever the ftronger power prevails in any great mu\u00ad\ntation, the more general effeCls we have been fpeaking of happen........-\nOther things likewife happen to individuals; becaufe the natural proper\u00ad\nty of each is overcome by the contrariety of the circumambient matter,\nwhether the antipathy thereof be fmall or fortuitous. Now, this being\nadmitted, it becomes apparent that of thofe things which happen gene\u00ad\nrally and particularly, be the accident whatever it may, whofe firft\ncaufe is ftrong and irrefiftable, and no other caufe having power to with-\nftand it, come to pafs wholly by neceflity. But thofe accidents\nwhich have a weaker caufe are overthrown, if any other caufe, able to\nwithftand it, is found; and, if fuch a refilling caufe appears not, then\nthofe accidents happen agreeable to the nature and impull'e of their firft\ncaufe; and they are produced, not through the ftrength of the caufe, nor\nby neceflity, but becaufe the antipathy by which it might have been\ndeftroyed is neither known nor to be defined. Thus it happens to\nall things that have a natural caufe and beginning, as metals, ftones.\nNo. 20. 5 C plants.\nO\nriginal from\nvn by D i i m i r i i p b a d v\nDigitized by Goc gle\n\f396 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N .\nplants, animals, wounds, ficknefs, affedlions, &c. fome of which work\nneceffarily, and others not, except when fomething is found of fuffici-\nent ftrength to oppofe their efficient power. Hence it is demonftrable,\nthat, though fimple caufes have natural properties peculiar to themfelvcs,\nyet there are other caufes equally fimple, which operate in contact with\nthole of the former, and by which the bare fimple nature of each is\nchanged by mutation into a third quality which differs in nature from\neither of the former; according to which fuch fimple natural proper\u00ad\nties are either partly or wholly changed, or otherwife fruftrated or di\u00ad\nverted. As for example, in the weather, the Sun, in his own fimple\nnature, is the fountain of light and heat; but, being joined with Saturn,\nnever fails, if not prevented by fome other apparent caufe, both in win\u00ad\nter and fummer, to produce cold and cloudy weather. But, if Mars hap\u00ad\npens to be joined in configuration with them, the cafe is altered, and,\ninftead of cold, the weather will not fail, in fummer, to be hot and ful-\ntry, though at the fame time cloudy, corrufcuous, and diforderly; and,\nin winter, remarkably clofe and warm, though lowering and turbulent;\nmore efpecially if attended with a new or full Moon. Thefe are fadts\nfounded upon a rational hypothefis, and proved by long experience and\nconftant obfervation.\nThefe preliminaries being laid down, and conlidercd as the ground\u00ad\nwork of Allrology, it follows that thofe, who would wiffi to be proficient\nin it, ffiould learn topredidl futurities after a natural way, by fuch prefci-\ncnce as nature has pointed out, and not by an inconfiderate or vain opi\u00ad\nnion that this (hall happen, becaufe it hath many great and efficient\ncaufes which it is impoffible to refill j or that this (hall not happen,\nbecaufe it hath refilling affedlions. Calculators of nativities, therefore,\nwhen thdy fpeak of thofe things which may come to pafs, can do it in\nno other way, conformable to truth and nature, but by the power and\neffetls of the circumambient matter or afpefls, which, being more or\nlefs inclined to fuch a temperature, will produce fuch an accident, lla-\nture of body, or difpofition of mind. As when a phyfician afferts that\nan ulcer will eat away or putrefy, or a naturalill that the loadftone will\nattract iron ; not becaufe it is neceffary that the ulcer Ihould eat away\nor putrefy, or the loadllone attradl; but, if the contraries are not known\nnor their effects prevented, thefe circumllances will affuredly happen,\naccording to the caufe and confequcnces of things, as they have been\nfrom the beginning of the world. Thus it happens, and thus we ought\nto judge, in the calculation of nativities; for thofe events which per\u00ad\npetually fall in upon all human affairs, are produced according to the\nl'ucccffion of natural order, either becaufe things that may oppofe and\nprevent\nDigitizedby G O O Q l e\nOriginal from\nv n c k ' Dl ID I I r I I R R A P V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 397\nprevent are not found, or becaufe they are not known. And again,\nevents known naturally, and according to order, and thofe things being\nfound which difagree and oppofe, they are then either wholly prevented,\nor elfe come to pafs with very fmall effett, and are Scarcely vifible in\ntheir operation.\nNow, feeing there is both in generals and particulars fuch a confe-\nquence, it is curious to remark, that though many people believe in\ngenerals, and allow it is poflible to prognoflicate upon that fyflem, and\nalfo think it advantageous towards prefervation and health ; yet in par\u00ad\nticulars they will not allow the fame operations to have any force. For\nmany confefs they know the proper feafons, and the lignification of the\nfixed ftars, and the afpedts of the Moon, and they obferve them for the\neftablifhment of their health, and to reduce their conflitutions to a good\nand regular temperature, in fummer by cooling medicaments, and in\nwinter by heating. They alfo obferve the fignifications of the fixed\nliars, for the purpofes of navigation ; and they plant, and fow, and for\u00ad\nward vegetation, by obferving the different afpedls of the Moon ; and\nno one fuppofes thefe general effedls either impoflible or ufelefs. But\nin particulars, as of cold or heat, which increafe and decreafe in their\nproper temper, and by the properties and mixtures of other matter, they\nneither believe it poflible to foretel, or conceive that we may be pre-\nferved from, the confequences attending them. But the caufe of this\nopinion, is the difficulty of knowing particulars, and the management\nof them, with precilion and truth j and becaufe men are feldom found of\nfo penetrating a comprehenfion, that none of the contraries be hidden\nfrom their view ; hence, the oppofing power of influence for the mofl\npart not being joined with a foreknowledge in the effect produced by firffc\ncaufes without impediment, they judge of things Amply, as though\nimmutable and impoflible to be prevented. But as in the art of predic\u00ad\ntion its poflibility appears worthy of confideration, although it is not\naltogether infallible, this prefervative part is certainly worthy of parti\u00ad\ncular regard, fince it may bring relief to many, though not a perfedt cure\nto all. For this reafon the Egyptians, finding the efficacy of this art,\nevery where joined phyfic to prognoftic aflronomy; and hence it is ap\u00ad\nparent, tha', if they had thought futurities could not be removed or di\u00ad\nverted, they would never have prescribed certain remedies and perferva-\ntives againlt the effedl of the ambient, prefent or to come, whether in\ngeneral or particular cafes ; they therefore fought out a method at once\nadvantageous and profitable, that by aftrology the quality of the Subja\u00ad\ncent temperaments, and the accidents which come to pafs by the influ\u00ad\nence of the heavenly bodies, might be difeovered and known; but\nj the\nDigitized by Cj O O Q I c\nOriginal from\nME\\A\/ v n e t ' Dl mi IC I I R B A D V\n\f4\n398 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe medical art, to didinguidi the fimpathies and antipathies of each,\nand to underdand the natural cure of prefent difeafes, and the true\nmode of preservation from future. For without this fpecies of adro-\nnomic knowledge ^hc medical art is foundin many cafes to fail; though\nI am ready to allow that there are not remedies to be found for all bodies\nand difeafes.\nThefe observations become clear and obvious, from a confideration\nof the planets and their afpcdls. The Sun is found by nature to caufe\nheat and drinefs in a moderate degree. His power and influence is mod\nviiible to our fenfes, by reafon of his magnitude, and the manifeft mu\u00ad\ntation of the feafons; fer, by how much the nearer he approaches to\nour vertical point, by fo much the more he flirs up heat in us, and\nfubjevts us to his nature. But the nature of the Moon is chiefly moid-\neniug; for, being nearer the earth. She exhales the vapours of all moid\nbodies, and thus evidently affedts all moid things, and putrefies them j\nbut, becaufe of her analogy with the Sun, (he moderately participates of\nheat. The planet Saturn cools and dries, becaufe he is far didant from\nthe heat of the Sun and vapours of the earth j but he cools mod abun\u00ad\ndantly, and dries mod moderately. The other planets alfo receive\nvirtue according to the configurations they make with the Sun and\nMoon. Mars drieth much, and burns, becaufe of his hot and fiery na\u00ad\nture ; but the influence of Jupiter is temperate, becaufe he moves be\u00ad\ntween the coldnefs of Saturn and the heat of Mars. Venus hath nearly\nthe fame temperature, but in a different meafure, becaufe of her vicini-.\nty to the Sun ; (he moidens mod, as does the Moon, through the great-\nnefs of their light, by which they affume the moidure of the vapours of\nthe earth. Mercury fometimes dries, and fometimes moidens, according\nto his pofition and configuration with other dars. Hence arife the four\nprincipal humours, from whence all bodies are engendered. Tw o of\nthem are generative and afclive, the hot, and the moifl ; for by thefe are\nall things joined together, and increafed ; and two are corruptive and\nhurtful ; the dry, and the cold ; for by thefe all things are diffolved,\nand dedroyed. Wherefore two of the planets, viz. Jupiter and Venus, are\ndefined to be benefics, becaufe of their benevolent temperature, and\nbecaufe heat and moidure equally abounds in them ; and likewife the\nMoon, for the fame reafons. But Saturn and Mars, being of an oppo-\nfite nature, are defined to be of a malevolent and dedrudtive influence, by\nreafon of the extreme cold of the one, and the violent heat of the other.\nBut the Sun and Mercury, being of a controvertible nature, are found to\nproduce both thefe influences, according to the nature, force, and quality,\nof the afpedts or configurations they make with other bodies.\nAs\nO\nriginal from\nM P J i f Dl I P I I r I I P D A R V\nDigitized by Google\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 399\nAs there are four diftindt humours or qualities incident to the planets,\nfo are there two primary fexes by which they are diftinguifhed, namely,\nthe mafculine and the feminine. The feminine planets partake prin\u00ad\ncipally of moifture ; therefore the Moon and Venus are termed feminine,\nbecaufe moifture chiefly abounds in them. But Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,\nand the Sun, are mafculine, becaufe they heat and dry with the greater\nenergy. Mercury, in point of fex, is confidered indifferently, becaufe\nhe equally dries or moiftens as occafion may be; The ftars are likewife\nconfidered, as to fex, according to their pofition with the Sun. When\nthey are oriental, and going before the Sun, they become mafculine;\nbut, when they are occidental, and follow the Sun, they are feminine.\nThe two apparent diftindtions of time, called day and night, are alfo\ndivided into fexes. The day, becaufe of its heat and adlivity, is termed\nmafculine ; and the night, becaufe of its moifture, and conveniency for\nreft, feminine ; therefore the Moon and Venus are nodturnal, and the\nSun and Jupiter diurnal; but Mercury is in this rcfpedl alfo indifferent,\ndiurnal when in an oriental fituation, and nodturnal when occidental.\nBut the two malevolent planets, Saturn and Mars, are confidered diur\u00ad\nnal and nodturnal, not according to their quality and nature, as heat to\nheat, but contrary j for a good temperament, taking its like, maketh\nthe good greater j and unlike, mixed with evil, deftroys much of that\nevil j therefore Saturn, as cold, is joined to the heat of the day j and\nMars, as dry, to the moifture of the night. So each of them, becoming\nmoderate in their influences, will appear confonant to the conditions\nwhich give the temperament. It is alfo to be remarked, that a planet is\ndiurnal, when in a diurnal nativity above the earth and in a nodturnal\nnativity under the earth j but n\no\nB\nu\nr\nn\na\nl,when in a nodturnal nativity\nthe earth or in a diurnal nativity under the earth.\nNow the influences and effedts of the planets have fmaller or greater\nforce, according to their afpedts and configuration with the Sun ; for\nthe Moon along her increafe, from her firft appearance to the firft\nquarter, is moiftening $ from the firft quarter to her full, fhe warms ;\nfrom the full to the laft quarter, fhe dries ; and, from the laft quar\u00ad\nter till fhe is hid, fhe is cold. The planets matutine to the firft fta-\ntion are more moift j from the firft ftation till they rife at night,\nthey are more heating ; from their rifing at night to the fecond ftation,\nthey dry more j and, from the fecond ftation, they cool more. The firft:\nftation is when a planet begins to be retrograde; and the fecond ftation\nwhen from retrogradation it becomes diredt ; and they begin to rife at\nnight when in oppofition to the * Sun. Thus the power of thefe va\u00ad\nrious\n* The rifing and fetting of the ftars are threefold j cofmical, achronical, and heliacal.\u2014\nCofinical rifing is, when a ftar or planet afeends the horizon with the fame degree and mi-\nNo. so. 5 D nute\nitizedby G o o g l e\nOriginal from\nM C \\ A \/ Dl I P I I r I I R P A P V\n\f400 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nrious affeftions, being mixed among themfelves, produces many diffe\u00ad\nrences of quality in the circumambient matter which continually fur-\nrounds us ; the proper and diftinct power of which, alternately prevail\u00ad\ning, is changed more or lefs by the force of other configurations. To\nthefe effects, the operation of the fixed ftars in general contaibute not a\nlittle. Thofe of the greateft magnitude are the moft powerful and ef\u00ad\nficacious j and thofe in or near the ecliptic have more energy than thofe\nremote from it. The bright ftars have more influence than the dull\nand languid j thofe of a red colour partake of the quality of Mars ;\nthofe of a lead colour operate with fimilar effect to Saturn j and fo of\nthe others, according to their affinity with the planets, as hath been al\u00ad\nready explained. Stars which have northern latitude and declination\naffedt us moft ; and with South Latitude, the more fouthern. Thofe\n^lituated in the zenith influence more than thofe which arc more re\u00ad\nmote ; and fuch as are in partile conjunction or antifeion of any planet,\nor which rife or fet, or culminate, with any planet, have a more than\nordinary power and influence : but of themfelves the fixed ftars emit no\nrays.\nThe four angles of the horofeope, or cardinal houfes of heaven, from,\nwhence the general winds take their rife, muft likewife be confidered.\nThe oriental angle is poffeiTed of great drinefs j for, when the Sun ar\u00ad\nrives there, thofe things which were moiftened by the night begin to dry;\nand the winds which blow from thence, commonly called eaft-winds, are\nvery drying, and without moifture. The angle of the fouth is moft hot,\nbecaufe the Sun, being there culminate, burns and heats with greater\nenergy, becaufe our mid-heaven declines to the fouth ; wherefore the\nwinds proceeding from thence, commonly called fouth-winds, are hot\nand filling. But the occidental angle is moift, becaufe, when the Sun\narrives there, thofe things which were dried in the day begin to be\nmoiftened ; confcquently the winds blowing from thence, commonly\ncalled weft-winds, are free from thicknefs or moifture. The northern\nangle or point, lying towards the Bears, is moft cold, becaufe the culmi\u00ad\nnating Sun, in refpect to that part of the earth which we inhabit, declines\nmoft from it j for which reafon, the winds blowing from that quarter\nare generally cold and freezing. The perfedt knowledge of thefe things\nis very neceffary to enable us to diftinguifh the mixture of particulars; for\nit\nnute of the ecliptic in which the Sun is ; and cofmical fetting is, when a ftar or planet fets exaftly\nwhen the Sun rifes. Achronical rifing is, when a ftar rifes above the horizon at Sun fetting ; and\nachronical fetting is, when a ftar fets with the Sun. Heliacal rifing is* when a ftar, which before\nw\nas>hidden by the rays ofthe Sun, begins to appear in the eaft ; and heliacal fetting is, whga a ftar,\nwhich before was feen, is hidden under the Sun-beams, and disappears#\nDigitized by G<x sle Original from\nMC\\A\/ v n o VDl ID I Ir I I D R A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 401\nit is apparent, that, according to the conftitution of the feafons, of ages,\nand of the angles, the efficient power and influence of the ftars vary;\nand, when there is no contrary conftitution, the ftars have a longer\ninfluence, becaufe it is unmixed ; for, in heating, they that are moft hot\nare moft powerful j and, in moift conftitutions, thofe are the moft pow\u00ad\nerful which are of a moiftening nature. But, when the conftitution is\ncontrary, they are weaker, by reafon of the temperament and mixture of\ncontrariety, affe&cd by the heating ftars in cold conftitutions, and by\nthe moift in dry. In the fame manner each of the other conftitutions\nhave power, according to the proportions of their mixtures. To thefe\nwe may join the mutual properties of the twelve figns of the zodiac j\nfor their general temperatures are agreeable to the feafons fubjeCt to each\nfign ; and they obtain fome other qualities arifing from their analogy to\nthe Sun, Moon, and ftars ; and thefe confiderations of the agreement or\ndifagreement of the natures and mixtures of the various influences of the\nftars, ftgns, and parts of heaven, are of no fmall confequence in aftrolo-\ngical contemplations.\nOf the twelve figns, fome are termed tropics, fome equinodtial, fome\nfixed, and others bicorporal. The tropics are two; the firft from the\nfummer folftice, the thirty degrees of Cancer ; and the other from the\nwinter folftice, the thirty degrees of Capricorn. Thefe are called tro\u00ad\npics, becaufe, when the Sun is pofited in the beginning of thefe figns, he\nturns back out of the courfe of latitude or declination to the contraries,\nmaking fummer by his entering into Cancer, and winter by his paflage\ninto Capricorn. There are alfo two of the figns equinodtial; one from\nthe vernal equinox, which is Aries ; the other from the autumnal\nequinox, which is Libra. Thefe are fo termed, becaufe, whenevever the\nSun enters the beginning of them, he makes the days and nights equal\nall the world over.\nO f the other eight figns, four are fixed and four bicorporal. The fixed\nare thofe which follow the tropical and equinodtial ; becaufe, when the\nSun is pofited in any of thefe, the cold or heat, or drinefs or moif-\nture of the feafons, which began while the Sun was in the tropics of\nequinoctials, more ftrongly affects us, and the conftitution of the fea\u00ad\nfons is more forcibly felt ; not becaufe their condition is naturally fuch,\nbut becaufe we, being no longer under fuch a conftitution, become more\nfenfible of its power. The bicorporal follow the fixed ; and, becaufe\nthey are between the fixed and the tropics, they partake of the nature of\nboth conftitutions.\nl Again,\nDigitized by Go*,'file Original from\nv n o k ' di i q 1 1r\n\fL^u\nnid\nin,\no\nu\nu\ny\ni\nt\ni\n-\nu\ni\ny\ni\nu\nz\ne\nu\n\/\niiiL|j.7\/vvvvvv.ridunu\nu\nb\ni\n.\nu\nr\ny\/c\nu_\nt.t;bb_ubt:-w-pu-yuuyit;\n4o\u00ab A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nAgain, fix of the twelve figns are named mafeulfne and diurnal j and\nfix feminine and nocturnal. And becaufe the night is always next to\nthe day, and the feminine is joined to the mafculine, they are placed\none after another by turns. The beginning is taken from Aries, be\u00ad\ncaufe the moifture of the fpring is the beginning of the feafons ; and\nbecaufe the mafculine virtue is predominant, and the active power before\nthe pafiive } therefore the figns Aries and Libra are efteemed mafcu\u00ad\nline and diurnal ; for thefe defcribe the equinoctial circle j and the prime\nmutation, and ftrongeft motion of all* is caufed by them. The other\nfigns are alternately placed one after another in their proper order ; and,\nfrom the form and quality of them, fome are termed four-footed, others\nterreftrial; fome commanding, and others fruitful. And, to renew them\nin the mind of the reader, it may not be improper to diftinguifh them\nhere. Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquaries, are maf\u00ad\nculine and commanding. Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn,\nand Pifces, are feminine and obeying. Aries, Taurus, Leo, Sagittarius,\nand Capricorn, are four-footed. Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, are\nterreftrial. Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifces, are fruitful. Again, Aries,\nCancer, Libra, and Capricorn, are termed moveable. Taurus, Leo,\nScorpio, and Aquaries, fixed. Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pifces,\ncommon. Aries, Taurus, and Gemini, vernal. Cancer, Leo, and\nVirgo, eftival. Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius, autumnal. Capricorn,\nAquaries, and Pifces, hyemnal. Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius* are hot,\ndry, and fiery. Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, are cold, dry, and earthy.\nGemini, Libra, and Aquaries, are hot, moift, and airy. Cancer, Scorpio,\nPifces, Gemini, and Leo, are moift and watery $ and Virgo is barren.\nNow from this difpofition and temperature of the figns are brought\nabout the great ends and purpofes of nature, by means of the afpedts and\npofitions of the planets configurated in them ; and it is upon thefe\nafpedts and configurations that the art of predicting is grounded, and\nthe events of futurity fought out and known. Thefe afpedts are of two\nforts, or clafies, viz. zodiacal and mundane. The principal zodiacal\nafpedts are the fextile, quartile, trine, and oppofition ; and, though the\nconjunction cannot properly be termed an afpedt, yet it may come un\u00ad\nder the more general name of a familiarity, common to all the afpedts.\nThe conjunction is formed by two planets being bodily joined, or meet\u00ad\ning in the fame degree and minute of a fign. The fextile is formed by\ntwo planets when they are two figns, or fixty degrees, afunder; the\nquartile, when three figns, or ninety degrees, afunder ; the trine, when\nfour figns, or one hundred and twenty degrees, afunder; and the oppo\u00ad\nfition, when fix figns, or one hundred and eighty degrees, afunder;\nwhich\nDigitized by Go*, sle Original from\nK I P A l V H D k ' Dl I D I I r I I D R A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 403\nwhich being juft one half of the great circle, places the planets exaclly\nfacing one another. The fmaller or inferior zodiacal afpe\u00a3ls are the\nfemiquadrate of forty-five degrees j the quintile, of feventy-two degrees;\nthe fefquiquadrate, of one hundred and thirty-five degrees; and the\nbiquintile, of one hundred and forty-four degrees. And thefe are either\npartile or platic; partile, when the conjunction or afpedt is made in\nthe fame degree and minute, and platic when not configurated in the\nfame degree and minute, but only within the orbs of the afpcding pla\u00ad\nnet. Moreover, thefe afpedls are either dexter or finifler ; dexter, when\ncontrary to the fucceffion of the figns, as a planet in Leo calls a fextile\ndexter to another planet in Taurus. Sinifter afpedls arc according to\nthe fucceffion of the figns ; agreeable to which, a planet in Aries cafls\nhis trine finifler to another in Leo; or one in Leo cafls a trine finifler\nto another in Sagittarius.\nMundane afpedls are thofe which are made in the meridional circle,\nin reference to the earth, and confifl of only the fextile, quartile, trine,\nand oppofitionf; though there are other familiarities which we call pa\u00ad\nrallels, and thefe both mundane and zodiacal. Of thefe familiarities,\nthe conjundlion is good with benevolent flars; but with malevolent bad.\nThe quintile, biquintile, fextile, and trine, are alfo good and fortunate;\nbut the femiquadrate, fefquiquadrate, quartile, and oppofition, are evil\nand unfortunate. Thefe good and evil influences proceed more from the\nnature and quality of the flars, than from the nature of the figns they\npoflefs; for it is found that even good afpedls of malefic planets will pro\u00ad\nduce mifchief, though not in fo great a degree as the evil configurations.\n#\n; Zodiacal parallels are what are commonly called Antifcians, and are\nnothing more than parallels of declination, or two points in the hea\u00ad\nvens at equal diflances from the beginning of any of the tropics, or\nequinoctial points. For example; one planet in ten degrees of Aries,\nand another in twenty degrees of Pifces, are in zodiacal parallel to each\nother ; or, in other words, one planet in twenty degrees of Pifces cafls\nits antifcian, or one parallel, to ten degrees of Aries, and its contra-anti-\nfcian, or another parallel, to ten degrees of Libra. But, in taking thefe,\nparticular attention muft be had to each of the planets latitude, for want\nof which, great errors have been frequently made. For, fuppofe the\nMoon to be pofited in twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with five degrees\nof north latitude, her antifcian, or zodiacal parallel, taken in the com\u00ad\nmon way, would fall in eight degrees of Leo, and her contra-antifcian\nin eight degrees of Aquaries; whereas the true antifcian falls in ten\ndegrees of Cancer, which is no lefs than twenty-eight degrees from that\nNo. 20. 5 E obtained\nDigitized by G O O < ? l e\nOriginal from\nm c w u v n c f c ' d i i d 1 1r 1 i d b a b v\n\f404 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nobtained in the common way, for there is exactly that difference be\u00ad\ntween the ecliptical longitude of twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with\u00ad\nout latitude, and twenty-two degrees of Taurus, with five degrees of\nnorth latitude.\nA planet thus confidered, as having latitude, hath four zodiacal paral\u00ad\nlels ; one at its body, one at its antifcional point, and the other two at\ntheir oppofite points. And hence, according to the example above\nRated, the Moon\u2019s parallels at her body fall in twenty degrees of Ge\u00ad\nmini, and at the antifcional point in ten degrees of Cancer; and their\noppofite points or contra-antifeians, fall in twenty degrees of Sagitta-\nrious, and in ten degrees of Capricorn. Thefe antifeians, and contra-\nantifeians, are always of a benign and friendly nature, when formed by\nthe benefic planets; but they are equally unbenign and unfortunate, when\nmade by violent and malevolent ftars.\nAs zodiacal parallels are only equal diftances from the tropical and\nequinodtial circles, fo mundane parallels, by a parity of reafon, are no\u00ad\nthing more than a like equal diftance from the horizontal or meridional\npoints or circles. For example, a planet on the cufp of the twelfth\nhoufe is in parallel to the cufp of the fecond houfe, becaufe it is exadfly\nat the fame diftance from the afeendant or horizon that the twelfth is ;\nand likewife in parallel to the eighth houfe, as being exa&ly the fame\ndiftance from the tenth houfe or meridian that the twelfth is. And, as\nthe zodiacal parallels are meafured by the circle of the zodiac, fo the\nmundane parallels are meafured by the diurnal or nodlurnal arches; for\njuft fo long as the Sun or any other planet will be in proceeding from\nthe cufp of the twelfth houfe to the cufp of the tenth, juft fo long the\nfame Sun or other planet will be in proceeding, on the lame day, from\nthe cufp of the tenth to the cufp of the eighth houfe; and juft fo many\nhours and minutes of time as there are between the fun-rifing and noon,\njuft fo many hours and minutes are there, the fame day, between noon and\nfun-fetting; hence the diftance between the Sun\u2019s rifing and fetting is no\u00ad\nthing but the diurnal arch, which the meridian, or Sun\u2019s place at noon,\ncuts into two equal parts; and the diftance between the Sun\u2019s fettingand\nriling conftitutes the nodturnal arch. Thefe mundane parallels have a\ntwo-fold confideration in direttions; firft fimple, and according to natural\norder ; and fecondly, according to the motion of the earth, or pritnum\nmobile, both of which muft be attended to in the calculation of nativities.\nNow there are figns diflociate and feparate; and thefe are fuch as\nhave no familiarity by any of the ways before mentioned ; for they nei\u00ad\nther\nOriginal from\nI C U \/ V n D ^ Dl ID I I r I I D R A D V\na*Google\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 405\nther command nor obey, nor mutually behold each other, nor are of\nequal power j but they are configurated by one or five figns, and do not\nat all partake of the afpedts, either by oppofition, trine, quartile, or\nTextile. Hence they are termed in]u\u00a3i; for, being configurated by one\nfign\u2019s diftance, they areas it were diitorted from each o:her j and thofe\nwhich behold by five figns divide the wh de circle of the zodiac into\nunequal parts. The figns. under this defcription, arc Aries, Gemini,\nLibra, and Sagittarius, which have no familiarity or afpedts with Taurus\nor Scorpio j and the figns. Cancer, Virgo, Capricorn, and Piiees, have\nno familiarity with Leo or Aquaries.\nBut the planets have familiarity with all parts of the zodiac by\nHoules, Trigons, Exaltations, and Terms. Cancer and Leo, approaching\nnearer to our vertical point than either of the others, and thereby pro\u00ad\nducing heat and warmth, are for that reafon defined to be the houfes of\nthe rvvo great and primary luminaries : Leo is attributed to the Sun as\nmaLuline, and Cancer to the Moon as feminine. Hence the femi-\ncircle of the zodiac from Leo to Capricorn is termed folar, and from\nAquaries to Cancer lunar, in order that each planet Ihould polTefs one\nfign for its houfe in each of its femicircles ; the one bearing configuration\nto the Sun, and the other to the Moon, according to the motion of the\nfphere of each, and to their natural qualities. Saturn, therefore, being\nin nature cold, and inimical to heat, occupying the higheft orb, and\nbeing at the greateft diftance from the luminaries, takes for his houfes\nthe figns which are oppolite to Cancer and Leo, namely, Aquaries and\nCapricorn, becaufe thefe figns are by nature cold and wintery, and the\nafpects which are made by oppofition do not combine to any good or\nbenevolent purpofe. Jupiter, becaufe his orb is next below that of\nSaturn, alTumes for his houfes the two next figns, Sagittarius and Pifce?,\nwhich are windy and fruitful, by reafon of their trigonal refpeet to the\nluminaries, which is a lituation proper for the produdtion of good.\nMars, being next in order to Jupiter, and dry by nature, takes for his\nhoufes the two next figns, Aries and Scorpio, which are iim'lar in their\nefifedts to Mars, by having malefic and mifehievous radiations with the\nluminaries. Venus, being temperate, has for her houfes the two next\nfigns, Taurus and Libra, which are of a fruitful and prolific nature,\nand correfpond with the luminaries by a Textile ray, and is never more\nthan two figns. diltant from the Sun. Mercury, being circumfcribed by\nthe orbs of all the other planets, takes lor his houfes Gemini and Virgo,\nand is n'.\u00aber more than one fign diltant from the centra!

The firft is\nformed by the three mafeuline figns, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; and\nit has for its lords, the Sun, Jupiter, and M ars; but Mars being of a\ncontrary nature to the folar influence, he is excluded from bearing any\ngovernment in this triplicity, and therefore the Sun has the rule by\nday, and Jupiter by night. Aries occupies the equino\u00a3tial circle, Leo\nthe eftival, and Sagittarius the winter. This trigon is principally\nnorthern, by reafon of the dominion of Jupiter; and it is windy and\nfruitful. It is alfo north-weft, and receives a mixture of the north-weft:\nwinds, becaufe it is the houfe of Mars, which planet ftirs up and governs\nthofe winds.\nThe fecond triplicity, which confifts of Taurus, Virgo, and Capri\u00ad\ncorn, is under the government of the Moon and Venus. The Moon\ngoverns by night, and Venus by day. Taurus is in the eftival circle,\nVirgo in the equinodial, and Capricorn in the winter. This triplicity,\nbecaufe of the dominion of Venus, is fouth ; for this ftar, being endued\nwith a warming and moiftening power, produces fouth winds ; and be\u00ad\ncaufe Saturn has his houfe in Capricorn, in this triplicity, it likewife\npartakes of a mixture of the eaft winds; for Saturn, being familiar to the\noriental parts, by reafon of the condition of the Sun, produces and go\u00ad\nverns the eaft winds.\nThe third triplicity is formed of the figns Gemini, Libra, and Aqua-\nries, three mafeuline figns, and is placed under the government of\nSaturn and M ercury; Saturn rules by day, and Mercury by n ight;\nGemini is fituate in the fummer circle, Libra in the equinotiial, and\nAquaries in the winter. This triplicity is chiefly eaftern, on ac\u00ad\ncount of the government of Saturn; but it becomes partly north-eaft,\nby the influence of Jupiter, on which account it aflumes a mixture of the\nnorth-eaft winds.\nThe fourth triplicity, confifting of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pifces, is\nchiefly under Mars, who derives an influence here, on account of\nhaving his houfe in Scorpio ; but, becaufe the figns in this triplicity are\nfeminine, the Moon by night, and Venus by day, rule jointly with\nMars, and intermix their qualities and influence together. Cancer is\nfituate in the eftival circle, Scorpio in the winter, and Pifces in the\n3 equinoftial.\nV\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM P \/ i l V n B k ' Dl ID I Ir I ID D A D V\n\fThis triplicity is weftern, becaufe of the dominion of Mars and the\nMoon j but, affuming a mixture by the rule of Venus, it becomes in\nfome meafure fouth-weft.\nThe familiarities by exaltation are thus occafioned ; the Sun, when\nhe enters Aries, makes his tranfit into the high and northern femicircle ;\nbut, when he enters Libra, he pafles into the low and fouthern femicir\u00ad\ncle. For this reafon, the Sun has his exaltation in Aries, in which the\ndays begin to lengthen, and the heating nature of the Sun begins to in-\ncreafe j and for the contrary reafon he receives his fall in Libra. Saturn,\nbeing of an oppofite nature to the Sun, has an exaltation in Libra, and\nhis fall in Aries; for, whercfocver heat is increafed, cold is diminifhed ;\nand, where there is an augmentation of cold, heat is leflened. So the\nMoon, becaufe fhe makes her conjunction with the Sun in Aries, and\nmakes the beginning of the increafe of her light in the firft fign of her\ntriplicity, which is Taurus, that is afligned for her exaltation. So Ju \u00ad\npiter, the producer of northern and fruitful winds, when in Cancer, be\u00ad\ncomes more northerly, and acquires a greater increafe of power ; he\ntherefore takes Cancer for his exaltation, and Capricorn for his fall. And\nfince Mars is chiefly of a burning nature, and becomes mod heating in\nCapricorn, becaufe he is then in his molt fouthern declination, he hath\nhis exaltation in Capricorn, oppolite to that of Jupiter, and his fall in\nCancer. Again, Venus is naturally moiftening, but moftly fo when in\nPifces ; for which reafon fhe aflumes her exaltation in that fign, and\ntakes her fall in Virgo. But Mercury being of an oppofite nature, and\nmoftly dry, takes the oppofite fign Virgo for his exaltation ; for then\nautumn, the drieft part of the feafon, appears $ and he has his fall in the\nfign Pifces.\nFamiliarities by terms have been already largely explained in the\nformer part of this work. But it is necefiary to remark, that the be\u00ad\nginning of the figns, and of the terms alfo, ought to be made from the\nbeginning of the equinoctial and tropical figns j and this is manifeft, be\u00ad\ncaufe we fee their natures, and powers, and familiarities, have not any\nother caufe, but from the tropics and equinoxes ; for, if other begin\u00ad\nnings are appointed, we (hall either be neceflitated to ufe the nature of\nthe figns no longer in the theory of judgments, or, if we do admit them,\nwe fhall commit error by corrupting the diftances, and dividing thofe\nfrom which influences are afforded them.\nBefides thefe familiarities of the ftars and figns, they alfo poflefs what\nare called their faces, thrones, and the like. Their proper face is when\nNo. 20. 5 F each\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM P A f v n u t ' Dl ID I I r I I D D A D V\n\f4o 8 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\neach flar keeps the fame figure with the Sun and Moon which its houfe\nbears to their houfe. This is done when Venus makes a fexangular\nfigure to the luminaries ; to the Sun when fhe is occidental, and to\n, the Moon when oriental, according to the fucceffion of houfes. They\nare alfo faid to be in their thrones, when they have a power in the place\nthey poflefs, according to the foregoing prerogatives, by two or more\nteflimonies ; for then their energy and influences are increafed, becaufe\nthe familiarity of the ambient twelve figns co-operates therewith. They\nare likewife faid to be in their joy, when, although they have no fami\u00ad\nliarity with the ambient figns, yet are fo in refpeCt to others of the fame\ncondition with them, and by which likenefs there is found a communi\u00ad\ncation by fympathy. So again, whem they are found of an unlike and\ncontrary condition, much of their power is diminifhed by a new and\nmixed virtue arifing from the different temperature of the ambient figns.\nHence let it be underflood, that, when Mercury is one fign diflant from\nthe Sun, he is in his face ; Venus, when two figns diflant; Jupiter,\nwhen four figns diflant ; and Saturn, when five figns from the Sun.\u2014\nThe fame observation holds good in refpeCl of the Moon, but then the\nrule mufl be made in figns antecedent to her ; as, if the Moon were in\nVirgo, then Mercury would be fo dignified in Leo, Venus in Cancer,\nMars in Gemini, &cc. The thrones of the planets are thefe : Saturn\u2019s\nthrone is in Aquaries ; Jupiter\u2019s in Sagittarius; Mars\u2019s in Scorpio ; the\nSun\u2019s in Leo; Venus\u2019s in T aurus; Mercury\u2019s in Virgo; and the Moon\u2019s\nin Cancer.\nThe familiarities, by application and feparation, are likewife to be con-\nfidered in the DoCtrine of Nativities. Thofe planets which precede\napply to thofe which follow ; and they that follow feparate from thofe\nwhich precede. Thefe applications and reparations arc likewife to be\nconfidered with refpeCt to their latitude ; for the fmaller the latitude of\nplanets in conjunction is, the more powerful will be their influence ;\nand, if two planets in conjunction have confiderable latitude of different\ndenominations, their influence will be thereby- much leffened. This\nobfervation likewife holds good in directions; for, the nearer any pla\u00ad\nnet is to the ecliptic line, the greater will his influence be. Moreover,\ntheir effects are either flrong or weak, in refpeCt of the horizon ; for,\nwhen they are pofited in the mid-heaven, or pafs into the place fucce-\ndent to the mid-heaven, they are very flrong and powerful ; the fame\nalfo if they are in the horizon itfelf, or in any of the fuccedent houfes,\nand more particularly when in oriental parts. But, when they are in the\nimum ceeli, or otherwife pofited under the earth, their influence is very\nweak, and of but little effeCt.\n1 From\nDigitized by Goi 'ole Original from\nM P \/ i f v n u v D i i m i r i i b b a p v\n\fOF A S T R O L O G Y . 409\nFrom all the foregoing confnierations, it is evident that the efficient\npower of the ftars is deduced from their peculiar and natural afpedts.\nor proportional diftances, confidered in refpedt of the Sun, the angles,\nand the quality of the ambient figns j and by the power and influence of\nthefe afpe&s are all aftrological fpeculations governed. But how thefe\nafpects were firft difcovered, and their virtues and proportions afcertained,\ndoes no where appear; though it might be no difficult talk to account\nfor both upon philofophical and mathematical principles, fince nature\nevery where, as well in the motions and effedfs of the heavenly bodies,\nas in all other arithmetical and geometrical refpedls, particularly cele\u00ad\nbrates thofe proportions above all others; Picus, fpeaking of the afpedts,\nthinks mankind were led to the knowledge of them by obferving the\ndifferent phafes of the Moon ; for, when fhe is new, horned, in her\nquarters, gibboffity, or at full, her forms are flill changed at thefe\nproportioned diftances from the Sun ; befides which, it is to be obferved,\nthat in her annual revolutions fhe is conftantly found about the trine of\nher own place in the beginning of the former year.\nOther aftronomers, of eftablifhed reputation, have likewife obferved,\nthat nature particularly points to every configuration, while we confider\nthe motions of the other planets. Abohazer judicioufly affirms, that\nthe two inferior planets, in their ftations, defcribe the arch proper to a\nquartile afpect ; and Pliny alfo recommends to our obfervation the trine\nafpedt, conftantly formed by the ftations of three fuperior planets.\nBut, above all, it cannot be confidered without great admiration, how\nwonderfully nature hath nobilitated all the afpedts in the motions of\nSaturn and Jupiter. For, as their conjunctions are rare, and happen but\nonce in twenty years, fo hath nature evermore difpofed thefe conjunc\u00ad\ntions in the moft remarkable parts of the zodiac, that is, in fuch figns\nonly as behold each other in an equilateral triangle infcribed. For, be\u00ad\ntween any two great conjundtions of Saturn and Jupiter, there are nine\u00ad\nteen Egyptian years, three hundred and eighteen days, and thirteen\nhours, in which fpace of time thofe planets are moved from the place\nof their former conjundtions eight figns and almoft three degrees; which\nexcefs of three degrees is the caufe why, after ten conjundtions, they pafs\nfrom one triplicity to another, and one triplicity continues one hundred\nninety-eight equal years, two hundred fixty-five days, (the intercalary\nday of every fourth year omitted,) and ten hours. But the revolution of\nall the triplicities is finifhed only once in feven hundred ninety-four\nequal years, three hundred thirty-one days, and fixteen hours; or other-\nwife in feven hundred ninety-four Julian years, one hundred thirty-\nthree days, and fixteen hours ; which, being doubled, amounts to one\nthoufand\nOriginal from\nMPWil v n Q V Dl IP I Ir I I P R A D V\n\fAN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthoufand five hundred and eighty-eight, which number of years thofe\nauthors are thought to have refpedted who confidered the year 1588\nfrom the birth of Chrift would prove fo fatal.\nFrom hence therefore it is, and not without fufficient caufe, that\n-they are termed great conjundtions, both happening rarely, and abiding\nin one triplicity almofl: two hundred years together, and not compleat-\ning all the triplicities of the zodiac in much lefs than eight hundred\nyears : confequently they have not yet gone through all the triplicities\neight times fince the beginning of the world. Neither are the other\nafpedts formed by thefe planets to pafs unnoticed ; for whoever obferves\nwhen Saturn and Jupiter behold each other by an oppofition or quartile\nafpect, they will evidently perceive that they ftill carry fuch a regard\nto the figns or places of their preceding and next conjunctions, as ever\u00ad\nmore to irradiate the one and the other with an oppofition, fextile,\nquartile, or trine afpect; which I think is a fufficient proof that nature\nhath allured us to the confideration of the archs formed by thefe afpects\nin the particular motion of each refpective planet.\nTo confirm the virtues and effects of thefe afpects, we need only con-\n' fider what phyficians are taught by experience, namely, that the crifis\n^ of all acute difeafes has a palpable and extraordinary fympathy with\nall thefe five configurations of the Moon, made to her place at the be\u00ad\nginning of the difeafe. Or, as a further proof, we need only refer to\nwhat has already been faid relative to the tides, which conftantly\nobfefve the motions of the Moon, their fpring and highefl floods al\u00ad\nways concurring with their conjunction and oppofition to the Sun, as\nthe neaps and loweft tides always do to her quarters. And it is\nequally remarkable that the feas, in their daily ebbing and flowing upon\nevery coaft, have refpect only to fuch azimuthal circles, as are in a\nquartile pofition when the Moon paffes by them. Again, the Sun mod\nevidently manifefts great effects by the quartile afpect, fince he modi\u00ad\nfies and governs the viciflitudes of feafons, or four quarters of the\nyear, by his ingrefs into the four equinodtial and tropical points of\nthe zodiac.\nThe power of thefe afpects is not injudicioufly ftated by Julius\nFirmicus, in the arithmetical obfervation which he makes of the num\u00ad\nber of figns agreeable to the afpects, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, anfwering in pro-\ngreifive order to the conjunction, fextile, quartile, trine, and oppoli-\ntion ; for thefe numbers only, and no others, will divide the zodiac,\nconfifling of twelve figns; for which reafon he makes them the only\naliquot\nDigitized Go ale Original from\nv n c t ' d i m i 1r i i d d a d v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 411\naliquot parts of a circle. Ptolomy alfo added not a little to the dignity\nof thefe irradiations, when he firft difeovered the geometrical propor\u00ad\ntion which the fubtenl'cs of each of thefe archs bear in rel'pcd to the\ndiameter of a circle. Others again, with no lefs ingenuity, have ob-\nferved, that, amongft all regular or ordinate figures that may be inferibed\nin a circle, though the fame be infinite, there are none whofe fides and\nangles carry away the prerogative at the circumference and centre, hut\nthofc whofe fides and angles are anfwerable to the fubtenfes and archs\nof their afpeds. For, amongft all ordinate planes that may be inferibed,\nthere are no two whofe fides joined together have pre-eminence to oc\u00ad\ncupy a femicircle, but the hexagon, quadrate, and equilateral triangle,\nanfwering to the Textile, quartile, and trine irradiated. The fubtenfe\ntherefore of a Textile afpect confifts of two figns j and, joined to the fub\u00ad\ntenfe of a trine, compolcd of four, being regular and equilateral, take\nup fix figns, which is a complete femicircle. In like manner, the\nTides of a quadrate inferibed, fubtending three figns, and, twice reckoned,\nalfo occupy the moiety of a circle. And what the foregoing figures are\nfaid to perform, either doubled or joined together, may alfo be found\nin the alped of oppofition.; for the diametrical line which paffes from\nthe place of conjundion to the oppofite point, divides a circle into two\nequal parts, a circumftance which cannot be found in any other inicripts.\nFor example, the fide of a regular pentagon fubtends feventy two de\u00ad\ngrees; of an odagon but forty-five; the remainders of which archs, viz.\none hundred and eight, and one hundred and thirty-five, degrees, are not\nfubtended by the fides of any ordinate figure.\nAnd thus, as the fubtenfes of thefe afpeds are the fame with the fides\nof the foregoing inferipts, and only take up the circumference of a\ncircle; fo it is evident, that the angles at which they concur are the\nfame wherewith the ordinate planes take up the whole fjpace about the\ncentre. For, if we confider the angle of a Textile alped at the earth, it\nis all the fame with that of an equilateral triangle confiding of fixty\ndegrees, and contains two-thirds of a right angle; but fix times two\nthirds of a right angle make four right angles; wherefore fix Textiles,\nequal to fix equilateral triangles, fill the whole fpace about a point,\nwhich is equal to four right angles. Secondly, every angle of a\nquartile is a right angle, and the fame with the angle of a rectangle\nquadrilater figure, four of which fill a whole fpace. Thirdly, the angle\nwhich two ftars in a trine make at the centre of the earth, is meafured\nby an angle of one hundred and twenty degrees, which is equal to the\nangle of a regular hexagon, confiding of a right angle and one-third;\nand, taken three times, makes four right angles; whereof three equila-\nNo. 2 1 . 5 G teral\nDigitized by ( j O O Q I C\nOriginal from\nMCXA\/ V H D F Dl ID I i r I I D B A R V\n\f4.12 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nteral hexagons, or three trine afpe&s, alfo fill the whole fpace about the\ncentre. To thefe we may likewife add the afpedl of oppofition ; which\nconfifs of two right angles, and therefore being doubled will perform\nthe like operation with the reft; whilft any other figure of many angles,\nhowever joined together, will either fall fhort of tour right angles, or\nelfe exceed them. For inftance, the angle of a pentagon contains a right\nangle and one fifth over, wherefore three fuch angles placed about a point\nwill fall fhort of four right angles by two fifths of a right angle ; whilft\non the other hand foui* fuch angles will exceed four right angles by\nfour-fifths.\nThefe fpeculations therefore duly confidered, it were fenfelefs to ima\u00ad\ngine that nature hath fo many ways diftinguifhed thefe remarkable irra\u00ad\ndiations of the ftars in vain, or admonifhed us to a particular regard of\nthem, by lo many rare and fecret operations, as well in the motion of\nthe planets, as in their effcdls and proportions, if they were not endued\nwith more force and virtue than any of the others. Hence it has. given\nfcope to the ingenuity and abilities of the learned to afiign a caufe, why\nthefe few configurations, above all the others, fhould be endued with\nfuch extraordinary efficacy. Nor has any reafon yet been given, with\nmore apparent probability, than that thefe proportions, whereof the\nafpedfs are found to confift, areprecifely the fame with thofe which are\nfound in harmonical concords; for which reafon it is fuppofed no lefs\nprobable, that the rays of the ftars in thefe proportioned diftances, ffiould\npowerfully affedt the matter of all fublunary things, by the fame rule\nthat the like geometrical fymmetry in founds and voices fhould ftir up\nthe fenfe and paflions of the hearer. And it is an eftablifhed obfervation\nthroughout the productions of nature, that, where due proportion is\nnot wanting, there the never fails to endue all her effedts with fuch an\nheight of perfection, as cannot but ftrike the fenfe and underftanding of\nevery obferver. And thus it is even in artificial compofitions, and in\nmedicines; for we know thefe only to be moft kind and fovereign,\nwhich obferve a competent fymmetry or temperature of the adtivc and\npaffive qualities. W ith great propriety, therefore, and with every ap\u00ad\npearance of truth, moft of the learned agree with Ptolomy, that the caufe\nof this wonderful efficacy in the foregoing afpedls, proceeds in a great\nmeafure from harmonical proportion.\nBut more clearly to demonftrate this fimilitude or affinity between\nthe proportions of the afpefcts, and the like diftances obfefved in mufical\nconcords, we mull underftand that all harmony whatfoever originally\nfprings from three fuch terms of numbers as refpedt each other in fuch a\nmanner.\nDigitized by Goi. sle Original from\nM C U i \/ Dl ID I i r I I D D A D V\n\fOF A S T R O L O G Y . 413\nmanner, that their differences invariably retain the fame proportion as\nis found between their extremes. F\u00aer inftance, in thefe three numbers,\n6, 4, 3, anfwering to the figns of the oppofition, trine, and quartile\nconfigurations, it is evident, if we compare the extremes with the mean,\nthat 2 will be the difference between 6 the firft, and 4 the fecond,\nnumber; and 1 is in like manner between 4 the middle or fecond,\nand 3 the third, number; but 2 being double in proportion to 1, there\u00ad\nfore 6, the firft number, refpedts 3, the third number, with the like\nproportion. The analogy of which proportions, as before ftated, is\nfound to be the bafis of all mufic, arifing wholly from thefe three\nfimple concording diftances, which by muficians are termed\nconfifting of a fefquialter proportion, as 6 to 4 ; or, which is all the\nfame, of three or two ; diateJJ'aron, compounded of a fefquitertia, as 4\nto 3; and d\ni\na\np\na\nf\no\nn,confifting of a double proportion, as 6 to 3, or 2 to\ni; and is equal to the two firft diftances and proportions put together.\nFor a fefquialter added to a fefquitertia, according to the rules of pro\u00ad\nportion, will produce a diapafon, or double proportion, exactly fuch as\nis found between the former extremes compared together, viz. as 6 to\n3. In like manner, by comparing the diapafon with both thefe parts,\nthat is, with the fefquialter and fefquitertia, according to the cuftotnary\nmanner of fupputating proportions, we are brought to the two other\ncompounded or imperfect concords, fo conftituting the five firft'and na\u00ad\ntural diftances in harmonical founds, that, being diverfly and judicioufly\nvaried between themfelves, produce an infinite variety of all kinds of\nmelody.\nAfter the fame manner we'find it with regard to the light and in\u00ad\nfluence of the heavens. For, although there are other afpeits attributed\nto the ftars, both zodiacal and mundane, yet thefe five were anciently, and\nare even now, obferved as being moft apt to aCtion, and moft powerful in\ntheir etfe&s, namely, the conjunction, oppofition, trine, quartile, and\nfextile; and there is nothing more certain, than that by the harmonical\nmixture of thefe proportioned beams, the generation and corruption of\nthis mortal world is infinitely varied and governed. Wherefore, as the\nforce of all harmony, fo likewife the effectual reafon of all adtion in the\ninfluence of the ftars, is properly deduced from the aforefaid fymmetry\nof thefe diftances. But, more fully to illuftrate that the angles of the\nafpedts, compared between themfelves, concur with thefe harmonic pro\u00ad\nportions in mufic, let it be remembered, that ftars in an oppofite or dia\u00ad\nmetrical afpeCt are disjoined by the fpace of two right angles, which\nare meafured with the arch of fix figns, or one hundred and eighty de\u00ad\ngrees of circumference; and that the trine, confifting of four figns, or\no;ie-\nDigitized by Goi sle Original from\nKIEMJ v n o t ' Dl ID I Ir I I D B A R V\n\f4 H A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nc e hundred and twenty degrees, conftitutes one right angle and one\nthird of another j alfo, that the quartile afpedt takes up one entire right\nangle, and is lubtended with the arch of three figns, or ninety degrees ;\nai d likewifc that a Textile is conftituted but of two figns, or fixty de\u00ad\ngrees, which is two thirds of a right angle. This being admitted, if\nwe now compare the two right angles of the oppofition, taken toge-\n^ ther with the angles of the reft of the afpedts, and either the trine placed\n~ between the oppofition and the quartile, or the quartile between\ny the oppofition and the Textile, we (hall find either way three r.urn-\n^ bers which admit all the laws of harmonic proportion, as becomes evU\n1 dent by the following figures*.\nThe firft figure fufficiently.explains itfelf j but in the fecond, let the\n\u2022 oppofition be compared with the Textile, and it will be found to have a\n^ triple proportion to the Tame, compounded of a double and fel'quialter\n^ proportion, as diapente is with diapafon in mulic; and hence it is found*\nno fimple or perfedt afpedt, but exadtly anfwerable to B flat, the hrft\nimperfedtor compounded concord in mulic, being a fixth from G re\nu t \u2022\n,\nwhich is neverthelefs in Tome refpedts efteemed perfedt, becaufe it\nbears the fame divifion, compared to Df o l re, as the perfedt concords do;\nfor it is half a fifth, ^pd'fituate in the centre between r and D f o l re.\nAgain, tfie fextile afpedt compared with the trine, is juft one half there\u00ad\nof, which has been already proved to be in a fefquialter proportion to\nthe oppofition, as D f o l re is to r u t, and therefore exactly correfponds\nwith the diapente in mufic, which I here take occafion to mention\n* T he firft figure proves the three concords to have three perfe& afpe& s \\ and the fecond\n(hews the fextile to be an imperfect afpeft, agreeable to diapente cum diapafon, that is, a triple pro\u00ad\nportion, as 60 is to 80.\nagain\nDigitized by Got ale Original from\nklCMJ D I I Q I I r I I D D A D V\n\fOF A S T R O L O G Y .\nagain, becaufe I may hereafter allude to it when I come to fpeak of the\nnew afpects. What I have already faid will fuffice to ffiew the pfiilo-\nfophical fpeculation of thofe who have afcribed the efficacy of the pla\u00ad\nnetary irradiations to the harmonical proportions which are found between\nthem; and, fince it is obvious that thefe afpects do really bear the fame\nmutual refpect one towards another as all harmonical concords are found\nto retain among themfelves, what reafon can be affigned, why nature\u2019s\noperations in the lights and influences of the heavenly bodies ffiould not\nbe governed by this fymmetry of proportion, in the fame manner as we\nfind to be univerfally admitted in the fcience of mufic ?\nBut all this rather ferves to illuftrate a fimile, and to prove that nature\nhas indeed dillinguiffied thefe proportions with extraordinary virtues\nabove any other, than to fatisfy the mind in the infinite variety of\nfounds and lights, thefe proportions only ffiould correfpond fo fweetly\nin mufic, and be mod effectual in the operations of nature. Kepler,\nwith a fficw of plaufibility, has endeavoured to demonftrate, that God, in\nthe creation of the world, obferved the fame proportion in the magni\u00ad\ntude and diftance of the celeftial fpheres that is found in the regular\nfolids which in geometry have their origin from the ordinate planes ;\nand therefore concludes, that the motions of the heavenly bodies cor\u00ad\nrefpond moll fweetly, and co-operate moil powerfully together, when\nthe nature of fublunary things, endued, as he fuppofes, with a fenfitivc\nfaculty, apprehends and receives the beams of the liars by their con\u00ad\ncurrence at the centre of the earth ; which anfwers to the ordinate\nplanes, from whence the regularity of thefe proportions is derived, as\nthe impreffed characters of that admirable fymmetry which God is laid\nto have obferved in the creation of the world. And hence he fuppofes\nthat, as often as any earthly fubllance meets with thefe proportions, it is\naffected as it were by this idea, and exercifed in fuch a manner, that\nwhat it but ordinarily performs at other times it will now produce\nwith much more effect. Not that thefe proportions work any thing of\nthemfelves ; for, in mufic, it is neither the founds, nor the proportion\nof the concords, that work any thing of themfelves, or beget any de\u00ad\nlight in the hearer; but the foul, approaching to the organs of fenfe,\nthere firfl entertains the founds inwardly, then regards their proportions,\nand, finding the fame good and geometrical, lallly exhilarates itfelf, and\nmoves the body wherein it is as with an object wherein it takes delight.\nSuch alfo is the fympathy between the heavenly influences and all fublu\u00ad\nnary matter, animate, or inanimate.\nNo. 2i. 5 H But,\nDigitized by Google Original from\nm c i a \/ v n o t ' di m i \\r 1\n\fu\nu\ni\ni\ni\nc\nm\ni\n,\nu\nu\nu\ny\ni\ne\n-\nu\ni\ny\ni\nL\ni\nz\n.\ne\nu\n\/\ni\nill|j.\/\/v\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\n.i\ni\nd\nu\niiu\nu\nb\nL\n.\nu\ni\ny\n\/\nc\nu\n_\nL\ne\nb\nb\n_\nu\nb\nt\n;\n-\nw\n-\np\nu\n-\ny\nu\nu\ny\nl\ne\nDigitize\n416 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nBut, be this conceit of Kepler\u2019s as it may, we are not without fuffi-\ncient geometrical demonftration, to fhew the reafon why thefe propor\u00ad\ntions or irradiations of the ftars are more effe\u00a3lual than any others. For,\nlince it is admitted that an union of beams affords the greateft influence,\nfo it is allowed that the conjunction and oppofition are, for this reafon,\nthe moft potent and powerful configurations of all others, as is fhewn\nby the following figure, where we find the beams, as well incident as re\u00ad\nflected, to be united.\nPor, let A be fuppofed in conjunction with B, it is firft manifeft that\nall the beams flowing from G and E, the points of touch in the circum\u00ad\nference of A, fhall unite themfelves with the beams that are fent from\nB to C, the earth\u2019s centre. Secondly, we are alfo to obferve, that in\nthis cafe the beams A C , or B C, coming from the centre of the ftars,.\nreflect only into itfelf, as being perpendicular j whereas thofe beams\nwhich are fent from the points E and G make an acute angle at C, and\nreflect the one into the other at equal angles ; as G C reflect from C to\nE, and E C from C to G. Laftly, the union that happens in an oppofi\u00ad\ntion is manifeft without any illuftration, where the beams fent from the\noppofite points make but one ftrait line, as G F, and E H , in the\nforegoing figure.\n^ G o o g l e\nOrigirral from\nM C \\ A \/ V n D F Dl I DI \\r I I D D A D V\n\fOF A S T R O L O G Y . 4i f\nIn like manner, in my contemplation, the configurations of the Tex\u00ad\ntile and trine have a concurrence of their beams at the earth, and a mu\u00ad\ntual reflection of the one into the other, and fo an union by reflection, as\nin the following figure is manifeft.\nFor, admit A B C to be three ftars, A and B in a Textile configuration,\nand A C in a trine ; then, for To much as B F, the beam incident of the\nTextile, Tails obliquely in refpect of A F, and makes an acute angle there\u00ad\nwith, it is evident, to any one who has the fmalleft underftanding in\noptics, that B F fhall reflect to C, and fo be united to C F, the inci\u00ad\ndent of the ftar C, which is in a trine configuration with A. For the\nfame reafon, C F fhall reflect to the ftar in B, and be alfo united with B\nF, the incident of the ftar at B. And hence arife the grounds of that\nfamiliarity in thefe archs of heaven, which Ptolomy has laid down as the\nmoft apt lor the apheta of life, or the houfes of the figure.\nBut the quartile afpect, whofe beams only cut each other ad\nreSloSy and fo reflect into themfelves, derives its principal virtue from\nthe exact proportion of its angles in taking up the centre of the earth ;\nand hence the myftery of thefe configurations wholly confifts in this, that\nthefe irradiations only, and thofe that are derived from them, are pro\u00ad\nportionable unto all patible matter, and therefore moft effectual. For\nthat thefe irradiations only are every way proportionable, has been al\u00ad\nready abundantly proved, whether we refpect their taking up thecircum-\nference, the power, and proportion, of their fubtenfes, unto the diameter,\nor, laftly and principally, their occupying of place at the centre of the\nearth by their angles, whereby they muft needs fhine upon all element <ry\nA\nm ater\nOriginal from\nMEl\/i\/ V n E k ' Dl ID I Ir I I D E\n\f*!\u00a7 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nmatter with a due and even mixture of light and influence. And, fince\nno other archs, fubtenfes, or angles, are found to enjoy thefe preroga\u00ad\ntives, it is evident that thefe, above all others, have that fymmetry of\nproportion which is neither defective, interrupted, nor redundant j but\nl'uch are the archs, fubtenfes, and angles, of thefe irradiations, that thefe,\nand no other, are exactly proportionable. Now as that which is defedtive,\nand wants equality of proportion, leaves the action fruftrate and with\u00ad\nout effect; fo that, which on the other hand offends inexcefs, muft needs\nincur the contrary fault, and overcharge that which either nature or art\nintended to perform ; whereby it will neceffarily follow, that, wherever\nthere is no defect, nor excefs, but an equal and juft mixture of the in\u00ad\nfluence of the ftars in thefe irradiations, thefe only can be apt and pro\u00ad\nper to produce perfect and agreeable effects in the formation and tempe\u00ad\nrature of all fublunary things. For it happens in thefe effects which are\nproduced by the mixture of light and heat, juft the fame as in chemi\u00ad\ncal operations, where a defect of heat produces nothing j while, on the\ncontrary, excefs will deftroy the whole, cither by fublimation, vitrifica\u00ad\ntion, eruption, or the like.\nHaving thus fatisfactorily (hewn how the points of the ordinate planes,\nwhcreunto thefe configurations have been compared, often reiterated, do\ntake up place, I fhall now fet forth how the beams of any two ftars in\nany one of the former configurations fhall occupy more fpace than that\nwhich is comprehended between their incidents or beams of true motion;\nand how by their beams, either incident, reflected, or oppofite, they\noccupy and poffefs the whole centre of the earth at one inftant with pro\u00ad\nportionable angles. To demonftrate this, in refpect to the conjunction\nand oppofition, whofc force rather depends upon union than proportion,\nI need only refer the reader to a view of the laft diagram but one, where\nhe will find that the united beams of fuch ftars as are in conjunction and\noppofition furround the centre, and all elementary matter whatfoever,\nfubject to the actions of heaven. W ith regard to the quartile, whofe\nbeams incident and oppofite traverfe the centre of the earth at four right\nangles, viz. at A F G, G F I, A F H, and H F I ; and feeing four\npoints of a rectangle quadrilater figure hath been already proved to occu\u00ad\npy place j I likewife need no other proof, in this configuration, than that the\nreader will in the laft figure obferve how thefe four right angles, made\nby one quartile afpect, take up the centre of the earth. But, concerning\nthe trine and fextile afpects, we have yet more to confider; for, fuppofe\ntwo ftars, A and B, in the laft diagram, irradiate the earth with their\nfextile beams ; although it be true, that, by protracting the oppofite\nbeam from B to F, the centre of the earth feems occupied with propor-\n3 tionable\nOriginal from\nM C \\ A \/ v n o t ' Dl I P I I r I I D D A D V\nDigitized by Gc\nkgle\n\fOF A S T R O L O G Y . 419\ntionable angles, B F A being fubtended by the ark of fixty degrees,\nwhich is before declared to be the angle of an ordinate equilateral trian\u00ad\ngle, and fo leaves the outward angle B F I equal to the angle of an ordi\u00ad\nnate hexagon, fubtended here by the ark of one hundred and twenty de\u00ad\ngrees, which is the ark of a trine ; and the like being alfo found in the\nangles made by the oppofite beams ad ; yet, neverthelcfs, we\nmuft here coofider how the incident beam of B, viz. B F, refledts into\nC, and fo takes up the whole femicircle A B C I with three fextiles, viz.\nA F B, B F C, and C F I. In like manner, if we fuppofe C to be in\na triangular configuration with A, it is evident that as the oppofite beam\nof A, viz. F I, makes a fextile with the incident beam of a ftar at C, viz.\nC F j fo C F, being the beam incident of the ftar at C, refledls alfo to\nthe point B, and fo makes the fame three fextile afpedts wherewith the\naforefaid whole femicircle is occupied, as above demonftrated, Thefe\nconfiderations will undoubtedly fatisfy the reader how any two ftars, in\neither of the afpedts above alluded to, proportionably occupy the whole\ncentre of the earth in the fame moment of time, without reiterating the\nfame angle.\nI have hitherto only fpoken of what are termed the old configurations,\nwhich are indifputably the moft excellent; but I fhall now mention\nwhat are called the new ones, as introduced by the ingenious Kepler,\nnamely, the quintile confifting of feventy-two degrees ; the biquintile,\nof one hundred and forty-four degrees ; and th of one\nhundred and thirty-five degrees ; which afpedts, being added to the for\u00ad\nmer, make eight configurations, anfwering to the eight confonant flops\nin a monochord. Thefe new additions are by no means improperly made,\nfince many eminent pradtitioners of this fcience have experienced their uti\u00ad\nlity in fpeculations on the weather and meteors ; as well as in bringing\nup the accidents of a nativity. Neither is there any want of philofophi-\ncal or mathematical demonftrations to fupport them; for as in mufic\nthere are but three perfedl concords, namely, the diapafon, diapente,\nand diateflaron ; fo in aftrology there are but three perfedt afpcdls anfwera-\nble to them, viz. the oppofition, the trine, and the quartile ; the fextile\nhaving already been proved an imperfedt afpect, anfwering exactly to B\nflat, the firft among the imperfect and compounded concords. Where\u00ad\nfore, confidering that the firft three perfect concords are found to have\ntheir perfect afpects anfwerable unto them, and that B flat, being an im\u00ad\nperfect concord, is alfo found to agree exactly in proportion with the\nfextile, being an imperfect afpect, this undoubtedly gave Kepler fuffici-\nent reafon to conceive that the other harmonical proportions contained in\nthe fame monochord might alfo have their afpects, namely, the quin-\nNo. 21. 5 I tile.\nDigitized by Got gle Original from\nm c x a \/ v n d i i m 1r 1 i d r\n\f420 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\ntile, biquintile, and fefquiquadrate, which are precifely found to cor-\nrefpond with them, and are in a fimilar degree effectual in their mode of\noperation.\nThus having explained what the afpects or configurations of the pla\u00ad\nnets really are, and proved that their power and influences are grounded\nupon philofophical and mathematical principles, I (hall now proceed to\nfhew their applications in the iflues of human life, from the conception\nto the grave.\nIt is, I believe, univcrfally admitted, that the beginning of human\ngeneration takes place at the time of conception ; and therefore we ought\nto be exact in afcertairiing this time, and in confidering the effective\npower of the configurations of the ftars, as they then happen to be pofited,\nand from thence contemplate the qualities of the mind and body. For\nin the beginning, although the feed at once aflumes a quality by the\ncommunication of the circumambient matter, which at other times of\nits formation and increafe becomes different ; yet naturally, as it in-\ncreafes, it retains its own proper matter, and is rendered more like the\npeculiar nature of the firft quality, with which it was imprefl'ed at the\ntime of conception. But, if it be of fome importance to know the time\nof conception, it is infinitely more fo to know the true time of birth ;\nfor by the firft, the accidents only before birth are known j but by the\nfecond, thofe incident to our whole lives are to be difeovered. Where\u00ad\nfore one may be called a beginning, and the other an after-beginning j\nthe firft, the generation of human Teed ; the fecond, that of man. For\nin this ftate the infant aflumes many things which it had not when in the\nwomb, and thefe peculiar to human nature alone, and the formation of\nthe body. And although the properties of the celeftial and elemen\u00ad\ntary matter feems to confer nothing at the time of birth in refpect to the\nformation of the child, yet it operates moft forcibly upon it in other re-\nfpects ; for nature, after perfecting the formation, difpofes the enluing\neffect according to the ftate pf the former at the beginning. Hence it\nis reasonable, in thofe whole time of conception is unknown, that the\nconfigurations of the ftars formed at their birth, Ihould be fignificative ;\nnot that it wholly contains an effective power, but becaufe it neceflarily\nhath a power by nature fimiiar to the effective. But it is always beft, if\nthe time of conception can be had, to compare it with the time of birth ;\nfor the time of conception fhews what fhall happen to the infant while in\nthe womb; as whether it (hall be ftrong or weak, firm or infirm, perfect or\nimperfect, male or female. Angle or twins j or whether it fhall arrive to\nthe full and perfect time of birth. But the occurrences of life after birth\nare to beconlidered from the polition of the heavens at the birth only.\n2 Now\nDigitized by G o o g l e\nOriginal from\nv n o ^ m i d i ir i i c d a r v\n\fa\nif\nin\nn\nP\n)\n-\nn\nr\ni#\n^\nc\n;\nn\nq\nc\n^\n-\nn\np\n\/\nf\ni\ni\nm\n<\n;\nn\nn\nil\nh\np\ni\ni\n-\naaaaaa\n\/\n\/\n-\nH\ni\nt\ni\ni\n\/\nn\na\n7\nm\nF\n>\nin\n-a\nifin\nn\nc\n^\n'i\ni\ni\np\ni\ni\ni\nn\nn\nO F A S T R O L O G Y * 421\nNow, fince nothing can be predi&ed in aftrology without this funda\u00ad\nmental guide, namely, the radix, or true time of birth, various me\u00ad\nthods have been invented, in different ages, for the purpofe of afcertain-\ning this point with precifion, after the eftimate or iuppofed time is\ngiven.

Thus, having found the\ntrue pole of pofition, it gives the true oblique afcenfion or delcenfion of\nthe luminaries, with its diftance from the meridian ; by which may be\nfound the medium cceli corredt, and thereby the true time of birth.\nBefides thefe, there are feveral new methods of rectifying nativities\nby accidents. For inftance, fet the figure to the eftimate time, and\ndraw a fpeculum thereto; in which, befides the afpeCts *of the planets,\ninfert alfo the afpedts which the afeendant and medium cceli make with\nevery fign; this done, confider what promiffors occur to a conjunction,\nfextile, quartile, trine, or oppofition, of the afeendant or medium cceli,\nand for every year account one day in the Ephemeris to the year current\nin which the accident happened, find that promiffor\u2019s place (in that\nday adhering to the year current) for the eftimate time of birth ;\nfaying, as twenty-four hours is to the planet\u2019s diurnal motion, fo are\nthe hours and minutes elapfed from noon to the minutes to be added or\nfubtraCfed to or from the planet\u2019s place at noon that day according as\nthe faid planet was either diredt or retrograde; then, laftly, as three hun\u00ad\ndred and fixty-five days fix hours are to that promiffor\u2019s diurnal motion,\nfo is the number of days elapfed from the birth (at the termination of\nwhich the accident fell out) to the minutes to be again added or fub-\ntradted to or from the aforefaid place of the faid promiffor, as he was\ndiredt or retrograde; to which very degree and minute the afeendant or\nmedium, cceli rauft be brought. But, if there be no direction of the\nafeendant or medium cceli to fignify that accident, confider what other\nfignificator, being diredted to any likely promiffor, might effeCl the\nfame ; and, in the Ephemeris, againft that day fignifying the number of\nthe years current, for the eftimate time of birth find the place of the faid\npromiffor; then fay, as three hundred and fixty-five days fix hours are\nto twenty-four hours, fo arc the days elapfed (in which the accident\nhappened from the birth-day) to their proportioned part: fecondly, as\ntwenty-four\nDigitized by G\no<. sle Original from\nMPWW v n u t ' Dl IDI i r I ID D A D V\n\f426 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\ntwenty-four hours are to the fignificator\u2019s diurnal motion, fo is the afore-\nfaid proportional part to the minutes and feconds, which are to be fub-\ndutted out of the place of the aforefaid promiflbr; and the remainder is\nthe exact place of the faid fignificator at the true time of birth. In this\ncafe it will be neceflary to have the eftimate time very near, and that\nthe Sun, Venus, Mercury, or the Moon, be fignificators; and Saturn,\nJupiter, or Mars, or their afpeCts, promiflors j otherwife, if the more\n.weighty planets be lignificators, take the diurnal motion of the promifTor\nand work as before ; fubducting thefe minutes and feconds from the\nfignificator, and the remainder is the exaCt place of the promiflbr at the\ntrue time of birth. If yet no direction appears, which may lignify the\ngiven accident, confider the Moon\u2019s directions on the right-hand page of\nthe Ephemeris, againft the day fignifying the year current in which the\naccident happened j and, allowing two hours for a month, fubtraCt the\ndays elapfed from the birth-day from the hours and minutes, adhering\nto the lunar afpect, and the remainder will be the hour and minute of\nbirth corrected. The fame obfervation likewife holds good with refpect\nto the mutual afpects.\nBut the Ihorteft, eafieft, and moft Ample, way of rectifying a nativity,\nand which includes all the perfections of the foregoing, provided the\neftimate time does not exceed two hours of the real, is as follows.\nHavingereCted the figure to the eftimate time, obferve whether either of the\nluminaries be pofited in the centre of any one of the three prime angles,\nnamely, the afcendant, medium coeli, or feventh houfe, or near them;\nand, if fo, bring either of them to the cufp of the angle, and the\ndegree and minute they were in is the true time of birth. But, if\nneither of thefe are found thus centrically pofited, nor near the cufps of\neither of thofe anglds, then bring them to a right parallel from angles,\nand that will be the true time. If their pofitions Will not admit of\nthis, obferve the two benefic planets Jupiter and Venus, and note\nwhether either of them are fituated as above fpecified, namely, in the\ncentre of the angles, or in a right parallel with either of the luminaries,\nthat is to fay, with the Sun by day, or the Moon by nighty and either\nof thefe brought to the cufps as before, will give the true time of\nbirth. So likewife either of the malefic planets Saturn and Mars, if\nfound pofited in the centre of the angles, or near their cufps, or in\nparallel to either of the luminaries as above, will be the prorogator of\nlife, and likewife (hew the true time of birth ; but thefe Iaft pofitions\nare rarely if ever found in the fchemes of grown pcrfon\u2019s nativities,\n-becaufe their influences, if not corrected by the rays of benevolent\n3 ftars*\nOriginal from\nm p \\a\/ v n r v d i i d i ir i i d d a d v\nDigitized by Gc\nksle\n\fO\n' F A S T R O L O G Y . 427\nliars, are of fo deftru&ive a tendency, that they generally cut off life\nin a lhort time, either in infancy, or at leall in the full ftage of life.\nNow, having brought a nativity from its ellimative or fuppofed time\nto that of the real, we are next to confider its proper and contingent\nparts and fignifications, fo far as they relate to accidents before birth, and\nto thofe after the fubjedl comes into the world ; as alfo to parents,\nbrethren, and relations, of the native. The particular confiderations\nbefore birth relate to fcx, as whether the infant be male or female ;\nand likewife to number, as whether there be twins or not. The caufes\nof deformity, of monfters, and of thofe which perifh in the womb for\nwant of nourilhment, are alfo included in this part of the dodtrine of\nnativities. But the particular fubjedls of enquiry after birth relate to\nthe length of life and form of the body j to bodily difeafes, and\naccidental hurts and blemifhes of the members j to the faculties of the\nmind and mental affeblions. They likewife include the future fortune\nof the native, as well in poffeffions as in dignities; and alfo in the\nquality of his adtions. Then concerning marriage and procreation j the\nharmony of friends, and animolity of enemies; next of travelling ;\nand, Jaftly, of death.\u2014 But the confideration concerning death is natu\u00ad\nrally joined to that which relates to the fpace of life, fince it (hews the\nquality and mode of its termination.\nIt may naturally be alked, how thefe events are feverally and refpec-\ntively dillinguilhed ? To explain this, let it be always remembered, that,\nfor any particular event, we are to refer to fuch peculiar place in the\nzodiac as is proper to that fpecies of action in the geniture concern\u00ad\ning which we are about to enquire. And, whatever liar is found to\nhave dominion in fuch place, either by triplicity, houfe, exaltation,\nterm, or configuration, fuch liar lhall have dominion of the event. But,\nif two or more liars lhall be found in thefe feveral pofitions, then that\nliar which has familiarity by moll ways, namely, that has the majority\nof dignities, lhall be taken as ruler of the event, and lhall alfume the\ndominion accordingly. The quality of the event is always known from\nthe nature of thefe ruling liars, added to that of the figns in which thofe\nliars are pofited, and the familiarities they have with the other fignifi-\ncant parts of the heavens. The extent and importance of the event is\nJtnown from the lordlhips and dominions of thefe ruling liars, according\nto their llrength or weaknefs in refpect of their afpects in the world and\nthe geniture. They are llrong in refpect of the world, when they are\nin proper places, or oriental, or augmented ; and in refpect of the ge-\nniture, when they make their tranfits on the angles, or fuccedent houfes;\nN\no. 2 i . 5 L but\nOriginal from\nM P A i V f l R k ' Dl I P I i r I I P P A R V\nDigitized by Google\n\fbut particularly when they occupy the cufps of the afcendant or mid-,\nheaven. And they are deemed weak in rcfpect of the world, when they\nare in occidental places, and flow, retrograde, and diminifhing their\ncourfes; but weak in refpect of the geniture, when they are in cadent\nhoufes, or falling from the angles. The general time of the event is\nknown from thefe ruling ftars being orientally or occidentally pofited in\nrefpect of the Sun and the ho.rofcope, and from their being in the angles\nor fuccedent houfes; for, when they are matutine or angular, they are\nquick ; but, when occidental or vefpertine, flow.\nThefe things being premifed, it follows that the firfl confideration upon\n^>- the face of a geniture is that which relates to the parents of the native.\n^ The Sun, therefore, and Saturn, reprefmt the perfon of the father j and\nthe Moon and Venus that of the mother; and, as thefe are found\nafflicted among themfelves, of otherwife, fo we underftand the accidents\nappertaining to parents will be. The ftars that are configurated with\nthe luminaries fhew what relates to their fortunes and poflefflons ; for, if\nthey are furrounded by the benefics, and by fuch as are of the fame\nnature, and in the fame figns, or the fucceeding, their fortunes will be\nilluftrious and fplendid ; particularly if the Sun be configurated with\noriental ftars, or the Moon by occidental. If Saturn and Venus be ori\u00ad\nentally pofited, or angular, they forefhew happinefs according to the par\u00ad\nticular circumftance;? of each parent. If the luminaries are of ,\nand in no good afpect with the fortunate ftars, a low condition, or an\nignoble life, is prenoted : but, if the luminaries are varioufly configu\u00ad\nrated with good and evil ftars, a mediocrity and inequality in the fortunes\nof the parents is thereby demonftrated j as when Mars afeends to the\nSun, or Saturn to the Moon, and the benefics in different conditions.\nAgain, if the part of fortune in the nativity is found in a good pofition,\nwith the ftars configurated with the Sun and Moon, the. affairs of the\nparents will be prol'perous; but, if it be difeordant, and fituated in a bad\nplace of the figure, with malefic ftars, their concerns will turn out inju\u00ad\nrious and unprofitable.\nThe length and fhortnefs of life muft be confidered from other confi\u00ad\ngurations. If Jupiter or Venus are any way joined in afpect with the Sun\nor Saturn, or if Saturn hath an harmonizing configuration with the Sun,\nthat is, if they behold each other by a fextile or trine, and ftrongly dig\u00ad\nnified in other refpects, they proinife long life to the father. But if\nthefe pofitions are found weak, with Mars dignified above the Sun, and\nSaturn in quartile or oppofition, the father will be taken off in the early\npart of his life. The drftinctions which relate to the mother are thefe.\n3 If\nDigitized by Goc gle Original from\nm c u m v n o k ' m i m i r i i r b a p v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 429\nIf Jupiter is configurated to the Moon or Venus, or Venus alone beholds\nthe Moon by a Textile or trine afpedl, the mother will enjoy health and\nlongevity; but, if Mars be pofited in any of the angular or fucceedent\nhoufes, beholding the Moon or Venus with a quartile or onpofition; or\nif Saturn is thus configurated with the Moon, flow in motion, and de\u00ad\nclining from angles ; they induce the diredl contrary effedts, and pro\u00ad\nclaim adileafed and fhort life to the mother. Thus from the nativity of\na child may the principal concerns of the father and mother be fought\nout, and ascertained ; and fuch is the fympathy exifting by this bond of\nnature and confanguinity, that little difference will be found, if com\u00ad\npared with the proper nativity of each parent.\nBut, to give judgment in fuch cafes with correflnefs, feparate fchemes\nmull be erefted for the father and mother, by the following rule. In\nthe figure eredled for the father, if the nativity be diurnal,, note the\ndegree in which the Sun is pofited in the child\u2019s nativity, and make that \/\nthe degree afcending upon the horofcope for the father; and conforma\u00ad\nble to that order the cufps of all the other houfes, by the rules hereto-'\nfore laid down. If the figure be eredted for the mother, then take the\ndegree of Venus, inftead of the Sun, and proceed in all other refpedts\nthe fame. But, if the nativity be notlurnal, take the degree of Saturn for\nthe father, and that of the Moon for the mother. And in all thefe cafes\nit mult be obferved, that the nativity of the firft-born is to be pre\u00ad\nferred, then that of the fecond, and fo on. And that whatever is pre\u00ad\nnoted in relation to the parents from thefe figures, is only fuch as fliall\nhappen to them after the birth of the child, and not to any thing before.\nThe time in which any or each of thefe events will happen, is to be\nfought out by the archs of direction, or diftances of that liar which hath\nthe dominion in refpedt of the Sun and the angles of ,the world ; and\nthis I (hall make perfedtly eafy to the meanefl underftanding, when I\ncome to treat of directions in general.\nNow the next confederation in the native\u2019s geniture is the place of\nbrethren, and this is taken from the fign on the mid-heaven, and the\nmaternal place, which is the pofition of Venus by day, and the Moon by\nnight; for, as this can only relate to children born of the fame mother,\nthis fign, and that which fucceeds it, being maternal, naturally confti-\ntutes the place of brethren. This place, therefore, being configurated by\nbenevolent ftars, denotes plenty of brethren, becaufe the increafe of bro\u00ad\nthers and fillers happens according to the multitude of liars, and from\ntheir being fituated in double-bodied figns, or in thofe of one form.\u2014\nBut, if the malefics have fuperiority in number or power, or are adverle\nby\nDigitized by Go*, gle Original from\nM c u \/ 01 i p 11r 1 i p p a p v\n\fDigitize\n430 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nby oppofition, paucity of brethren will happen, particularly if unbe-\nnign ftars circumfcribe the Sun. If the contrariety of afpects be in an\u00ad\ngular houfes, efpecially in the afcendant, Saturn will procure thofe that\nare firft nourifhed, and firft born ; and Mars will induce to fewnefs and\ndeath. Moreover, if the flats which give brethren are well-affected ac\u00ad\ncording to mundane fituations, the general fortunes of the brethren will\nbe glorious and famous ; but mean and obfcure if the contrary pofitions\nhappen. If the malefics be fu'perior in number and ftrength to the\nftars which give brethren, their confutations will \u2018\nbe puny, and their\nlives fhbrt.\nAnd here alfo we may obferve, that from the geniture of one brother\nthe principal incidents of the life of another may be difcovered, .by con-\nftituting the place of the given planet as an horofcope, that is, the planet\nwhich has principal rule in the houfe of brethren, whether by day or\nnight. The method is to place this ruling planet, with the fame de\u00ad\ngree he is found in, upon the afcendant, furnifhing the cufps of all the\nother houfes by this ftandard, as before ftated in the cafe of parents. It\nmoft however always be remembered, that mafeuline ftars produce\nmales, and feminine females. Alfo if the ftars which denote brethren, and\nthat which has rule in the houfe of brethren, agree by any harmonious\nconfiguration, they will be well-affected towards each other, and live in\nfriendfhip and concord; but, if thefe ftars are found in contrary pofi\u00ad\ntions, and in figns inconj-unct, enmity and hate will.mark theirxonduct\ntowards each other.\nThe foregoing fpeculations are deduced from an inveftigation of the\npofitioft of the heavens at the time of birth; but, in.order to know whe\u00ad\nther the infant be male or female, during the ftate of pregnancy, the\ntime o f conception-only muft be confidered. .Forthis purpole, we muft\nparticularly obferve the-pofitionof both the.luminaries in refpect to the\nhorofcope at the time of conception, together with the fituations of\nall the ftars which have a regard to them ; and whether the ruling ftars\nare eonftituted of a mafeuline or feminine nature.

For it happens through the mixtures\nwhich are occafioned when thefe poflefs bicorporal figns, or when the\nruling planets are fituated in them, and many prolific ftars caft their rays\nto the fame, that it will be a plural conception. The number then\ngenerated is known from the ftar which induces the propriety of the\nnumber; but the fex is determined by the ftars configurated with the\nSun, Moon, and horofcope. For we find from obfervation, that, when\nboth the luminaries are in the mid-heaven, twins are procreated ; when\nSaturn, Jupiter, and Mars, have configuration with the afiigned places\nin bicorporal figns, three males are generated; but three females, when\nVenus, Luna, and Mercury, are configurated in the fame manner. Saturn,\nJupiter, and Venus, thus difpofed, produce two males and one female; but\nVenus, Luna, and Mars, two females and one male. Thefe configu\u00ad\nrations but rarely happening at the time of conception, render it a kind\nof phenomenon whenever they occur ; and hence we generally find the\nbirths that follow in confequence are ranked amongll the wonders of\nthe day in the public prints, though the caul'e has a radical foundation\nin nature. And hence too it is, that, as thefe configurations are more or\nlefs imperfectly made, fo will be the quality of the conception, either\nbringing all into life uniform and perfedt at the birth, or elfe bringing\none with good conformation, and another with puny, imperfedt, or mon-\nftrous, members.\nThere are alfo certain configurations of the ftars, which abfolutely pro\u00ad\nduce moles or monfters in every conception that takes place under\nthem. Thus it happens when the luminaries decline from angles, and\nfall cadent, without any kind of afpedt to the afcendant, and when the\ncardinal houfes are occupied by the malefic planets. But, to deferibe\nthe fpecies of unnatural birth, it is neceffary, in thefe configurations, to\nobferve the place of the laft full Moon preceding the time of conception,\ntogether with the ruler thereof, and the lord of the luminaries ; for, if\nthe places of thefe fignificators have no familiarity with the place of the\nfaid preceding full Moon, what is then generated will be of unnatural\nconformation. If the luminaries are at the fame time pofited in four-\nfooted figns, and the two malefic planets in angular houfes, what is\nthen conceived will not be in human fhape; but, if Jupiter or Venus in-\nterpofe their benevolent rays, and give teftimony to the luminaries, then\nwhat is conceived will be of human conformation, but of a fierce and\nfavage nature. If Mercury correfponds with the luminaries, the dif-\npofition will be agreeable to nature, but the form of the body will be\nNo. 22. 5 M unnatural;\nOriginal from\nM C \\ A \/ v n o t ' DI ID I I r I I D D\nDigitized by Go< gle\n\f43* AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nunnatural; or, if the luminaries be in human figns, and the ruling planet\n\u2022difcordant, then the offspring will be of proper conformatioon, but tnon-\nftrous in quality. If one of the malefic ftars give teftimony in any of\nthe foregoing pofitions, what is then generated will be irrational, or of\nungovernable qualities; but, if Jupiter or Venus give teftimony, the\noffspring will naturally poffefs the mental accomplifhments, with an her-\nmaphroditical conformation. If Mercury alone gives teftimony to the\naforefaid pofitions of the luminaries, that which is procreated will be\ndeaf, and perhaps dumb, though intelle&ually well qualified, and in\u00ad\ngenious. Thefejpeculations are doubtlefs abftrufe, becaufe fuch con\u00ad\nfigurations feldom happen, and the refult of them is very little known ;\nbut, to confirm their effedt, I have only to recommend to thofe who\nhave their doubts, to be guided by obfervation, and to decide by the re\u00ad\nfult; for, the more we enquire into the pathlefs ways of nature, the more\nreadily we deduce a radical caulefor all her productions.\nBut here I muft not omit to remark, that the time of conception, and\nthat only, is to be referred to for the conformation or accidents of the\nchild in the womb ; and the time of birth for what ftiall happen after;\nnotwithftanding there is always fuch a concurring agreement between\nthe conception and birth, that whatever is produced by the former is\nin a great meafure to be difcovered from the latter, though not wholly\ncorredt, or to be relied upon as infallible. Thofe therefore, who are\nborn in their natural fhape, and afterward become crippled and lame,\neven to a monftrofity, yet, fince not brought into the world with the na\u00ad\ntive, they fall under the defcription of blemifties, or bodily infirmities,\nrather than the refult of monftrous and unnatural conformations.\nDiftindt from this fpecies of conception, is that which, though per-\nfedtly natural and well conformed, yet is void of ftamina, and hence\ntermed an embryo not nourifhed. This kind of conception happens when\none of the luminaries, in an angular pofition, is joined with a malefic\nftar, and that luminary giver of life. So likewife, if the parallel of\nlongitude between the malefic planet and the luminary be partile, or\naccording to a figure of equal fides, and none of the fortunes correfpond-\ning, and at the fame time the lord of the luminaries be pofited in a dif-\ncordant place, what is then generated cannot be nourifhed, but decays\nin the womb, or expires foon after the birth. Or, if they are not equi-\nlaterally configurated, but the two malefic planets nearly irradiate the\nplaces of the luminaries, afflicting both, or only one of them, no matter\nwhether the malefics be fuccedent oroppofite, fo one or both of them be\nin partile configuration with the luminaries; for whatever is born under\n3 fuch\nDigitized by Google Original from\nm p u i v n o k ' d i i d i i r i i r r a r v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 433\nfuch influences will be of no duration, fince the greatncfs cf the power\nof the malefics will deftroy what fhould necefiarily conduce to the nou-\nrifhment of life.\nIt is particularly to be obferved, that Mars afflifls the Sun by fuc-\nceflions, and Saturn the Moon ; but by oppofitions the contrary hap\u00ad\npens ; for in thefe the Sun is affli&ed by Sat urn, and the Moon by M ars;\nand this affli&ion is the more eminent when the malefic ftars are fignifi-\ncators, and by that means become fuperior both to the luminaries and\nthe horofcope. From thefe obfervations, fubordinate effects have been\nafcertained ; for, when there are two oppofitions of the malefic ftars, and\nthe luminaries fituated in angles, whatever follows that conception will\nbe ftill-born. But if at this time the luminaries are feparating from the\nbenefic planets, or are in any other afpect with them, carting their\nbeams at that time in a converfe direftion, the fcetus will obtain anima\u00ad\ntion, and be found alive and perfect at the birth ; but will live only fo\nmany months, days, or hours, as there are degrees, minutes, or feconds,\nof the folar motion, between the beams of the Apheta and the neareft\nmalefic planet. But if the malefics caft their beams to the parts preced\u00ad\ning the luminaries, and the benefics to the degrees following, what is\nborn will l\u2019\nuffer great afflictions, and ftruggle much with infirmities, but\nfhall recover and live.\nAnd hence the confideration that naturally follows regards the dura\u00ad\ntion or fpacc of life, which, taking in the whole compafs of human pur-\nfuits, and the duration and viciflitudes of them, doubtlefs becomes the\nmoft interefting part of the doctrine of the ftars. The mode of afeer-\ntaining this important point, namely, the fpacc or duration of the na\u00ad\ntive\u2019s life, is defined from a companion of the aphetic, hylegiacal, or\nprorogatory, places, with the killing or anaretical places in thegenethliacal\nfigure, at the time of birth. The aphetic place is the fituation of the\nApheta, Hyleg, Prorogator, Significator, or giver of life, for they have\nall the fame meaning j and, the anaretic place is the fituation of the\nAnareta, or killing planet ; and, whenever thefe fhall meet together, or\nbe conjoined in a bodily afpect, the native will find a termination of life;\nconfequently the length of time, in which the Apheta and Anareta,\nas policed in each refpective figure of a nativity, will be in forming a\nconjunction, or coming together in the fame point of the heavens, is the\nprecife length of the native\u2019s life; and this period is afcertained by what\nwe term arches of direction, equated by the folar motion, and reduced\nto common time. The method of afeertaining thefe aphetical and\nanaretical places, of finding the arches of direction, and of reducing\nthem\nDigitized by Go*, sle Original from\nME\\A\/ v n o k ' Dl ID I i r I ID D A D V\n\f434 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthem to the common meafure of time, fhall be copioufly explained\nafter we have taught the mode of afcertaining the particular occurrences\nof the native\u2019s life, from the face of the horofcope, or genethliagal\nfigure.\nO f the FO RM and TEM PER A TU R E of the BODY.\nIf thefpace of life appears likely to exceed childhood, we are next to\nconfider and define the ihape and figure of the native\u2019s body, according\nto the rules heretofore laid down. The parts of the body are formed\nbefore the foul ; and, becaufe it is infinitely more grofs, hath a connate\nand almoft apparent endowment of temper. But the foul, not being\ncommunicated to the body till the entire conformation thereof be wholly\nperfected, manifefts by degrees an aptitude proceeding from the firft\ncaufe, but much later than thofe of the external accidents ; and therefore\nit requires fome length of time before the nature and progrefs of this\nmental aptitude can be known. As to the form and temperature of the\nbody, that is generally deferibed from the oriental horizon, and from\nfiuch of the planets as bear rule in it, or have the dominion thereof;\ntogether with their particular and refpective configurations with the\nMoon ; for according to the quality of thefe two places, and the nature of\nthe ruling ftars, the formative virtue, and the temperament in each fpe-\ncies, with reference to the declination of the afeending fixed ftars, is the\nparticular formation of bodies defined.\nTo what has been already faid, concerning the effects of each planet\nrefpectively, in giving fhape to fuch infants over whofe nativities they\nprefide, we muft likewife add the peculiar force and operative faculty of\nthe luminaries, with which they may then happen to be configurated.\u2014\nIf the Sun co-operates, it contributes much towards the production of a\nmore comely and majeftic perfonage, and of a mild and good habit;* and\nthe Moon, when fhe withholds her defluxion, caufes a more propor\u00ad\ntionate, flender, and moift, temperament; but varioufly, according to the\nnature and qualities of her feveral quarters. Again, if the luminaries\ncorrefpond with oriental rays, they add to comelinefs and ftature; or, if\nftationary, they make the native ftrong and robuft. But, when they\noccidentally concur, difproportionate formations and evil temperaments\nare commonly the refult.\nIn this fpeculation, the different effects of the four quadrants are\nlikewife to be confidexed ; that from the vernal equinox to the fummer\ntropic\n* i\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM C l \/ U Dl ID I \\ C I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 435\ntropic gives the native an excellent complexion, comely, of a good\nftature, abounding with heat and moidure. But the quadrant from the\nfummer tropic to the autumnal equinox gives but an indifferent com\u00ad\nplexion, though the body is well proportioned, healthy, and vigorous,\nabounding with heat and drincfs. That from the autumnal equinox to\nthe winter tropic gives a fanguine complexion, with a (lender, lean,\nand fickly, habit, abounding with drinefs and cold. The quadrant from\nthe winter foldice to the fpring equinox gives a dark complexion, with\na moderate dature, fquare and drong, abounding with cold and moif-\nture. This is to be underflood in reference to the (igns afcending, and\nin which the Moon and other fignificators refpedtiveiy bear rule. But\nit is more particularly to be obferved, that the figns which are of hu\u00ad\nman form, both in the zodiac and without it, make bodies of a mod\nexcellent fymmetry and proportion j while thofe which are not of hu\u00ad\nman form adt contrariwife, deranging the proper rules of proportion,\nand influencing from the properties eflfential to an elegant (hape to that\nof difproportion and deformity.\nO f the radical Caufe of B L E M I S H E S and B O D I L Y\nD I S E A S E S .\nFrom a flmilar hypothefls to the above, we derive the obfervation of\nexternal blemifhes and bodily difeafes, with all the common accidents\nof the human frame, to which the native is expofed during the courfe of\nhis life. The mod approved mode of afcertaining and didinguifhing\nthefe is by regarding the eadern and wedern angles of the horizon, but\nparticularly the wedern, and the part preceding, which is the fixth\nhoufe, for that is inconjundt with the oriental angle. Thefe angles\nbeing properly taken, we (hould next obferve the malefic dars, and how\nthey are configurated j for, if both or either of them are pofited upon tha\nafcending parts of the faid angles, either bodily or by quartile or oppo-\nfition, there will be external blemifhes, or bodily infirmities, infe-\nparable from the perfon then born. Or, if both the luminaries, or only\none of them, be angular, as above defcribed, either in conjundlion or\noppofition, with a malefic dar afcending, they will produce fuch infir\u00ad\nmities or blemilhes as the particular places of the horizon and figns then\nafcending, and as the nature of the malefic and ill-affedted dars, (hall\nrefpedtively manifed j for in this cafe, as in all fimilar ones, the degrees\nof the figns which are upon the afflidted part of the horizon will (hew\nthe particular part of the body wherein the infirmity is, whether it be a\nblemidi or difeafe, or both; and the nature of thofe dars will likewife\npoint out the caufe and quality of the fymptom.\nNo. 22. 5 N Blemilhes\nDigitized by Goo<?le Original from\nM O A f D fc' n i ID I I r I I D D A R V\n\f436 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nBlemiffies and bodily hurts for the moft part happen when the male-\nfics are oriental; but difeafes when occidental. And, as their caufe is\ndifferent, fo alfo is their effedt; for hurt or blemifh fuffers pain only\nonce, and is not prolonged; but a difeafe frequently comes by fits, or\ncontinually affefts the patient, inducing a long and lingering diftolu-\ntion, or confumptive habit. Thefe are general confiderations; but the\nmore particular doeirine of blemilhes and difeafes hath another fpecu-\nlation of figures, by which, for the moft part, fimilar accidents follow.-\nFor blindnefs of one eye is indicated, when the Moon is pofited in either\nof the aforementioned angles by herfelf, or at the precife time of be\u00ad\ncoming new or full; or when fhe is configurated in a quartile afpedl,\nand applies to any of the nebulous converfions in the zodiac. The fame\nmisfortune happens when Saturn or Mars, being oriental, afqend to the\nMoon, pofited in an angle; but, whenever they are thus configurated to\nboth the luminaries, either in the fame fign or in the oppofite, and\norientally pofited in refpedlof the Sun, but occidental in relpedt of the\nMoon, they caufe blindnefs in both the eyes. Mars ufually denotes\nblindnefs by the effedts of a blow or thruft, and by lightning, burning,\n&c. but, if configurated with Venus, it generally proceeds from an ac\u00ad\ncident in play or exercife, or from the fudden attack of aflaffins or def-\nperadoes.\nSaturn produces blindnefs by cataradls and colds, or by pin and web,\nand by fuch like accidents ; but, if Venus be pofited in any of the above-\nmentioned angles, particularly in the weft, configurated or joined with\n' Saturn, and Mars at the fame time elevated, or in oppoiition, the males\nthen born will be incapable of propagating their fpecies, and the females\neither wholly barren, or fubjeft to abortion, or to the bringing forth of\nftill-born children, or to fuch as adhere to the womb, and are obliged to\nbe feparated by manual operation, or brought away in pieces. This moft\ncommonly happens in the figns Cancer, Virgo, and Capricorn. But if\nthe Moon be at the fame time in the afeendant, configurated with Mer\u00ad\ncury or Saturn, and applying to Mars, what are then born will partici\u00ad\npate in the nature of both fexes, and perhaps be void of a natural paf-\niage. It is likewife found, that, if the Sun be configurated with Mer\u00ad\ncury, and both the luminaries difpofed after a mafeuline manner, the\nMoon decreafing, and the malefic ftars afeending in the following de\u00ad\ngrees, the males will be deprived of the members proper for generation,\nor be irreparably blemiihed or inefficient in them, particularly in the\nfigns Aries, Leo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Aquaries; and the females will\nbe naturally barren all their lives.\n3 Impediments\nDigitized by Google O\nriginal from\nM P l \/ i f V D Q l f Dl I P I I r I I P D A P V\n\fimpediments or blemilhes in the fpeech are found to arife from the\nconfigurations of Saturn and Mercury with the Sun, in the aforefaid\nangles; particularly when Mercury is pofited in the weft, and beholds\nthe Moon either by an oppofition or quartile afpedt. And, if thcfe con\u00ad\nfigurations happen to be made in mute figns, as in Cancer, Scorpio, or\nPifces, the impediment will prove confiderably greater. Again, if the\nmalefic liars are pofited in angles, and the luminaries afcend to them\neither by conjunction or oppofition ; or if the malefics afcend to the\nluminaries, and the Moon be in her node in hurtful figns, as Aries,\nTaurus, Cancer, Scorpio, or Capricorn, the defedts of the body will be\nby lamenefs, gibbofity, diftortion, or luxation. If the malefic ftars are\nin conjundion with the luminaries, thefe affedtions will take plaee from\nthe birth j but, if they are fituated in the mid-heaven, elevated above the\nluminaries, or in oppofition to them, they will aril'e from the concur\u00ad\nrence of various accidents, fuch as falls, blows, wounds, and the like,\nduring their progrefs through life.\nBlemilhes happen for the moft part when the Moon is in tropical or\nequinoctial figns. In the vernal figns they are .chiefly occafioned by\nmorphew; in the fummer, by tetters j in the autumn, by the fcurvy ;\nand, in the winter, by biles and other morbid eruptions. But difeafes\nmoftly happen when the malefic ftars are configurated in the aforefaid\nangles, but contrarily as to the luminaries, viz. occidental to the Sun,\nand oriental to the Moon. In thefe pofitions Saturn induces to unufual\ncoldnefs in the belly and reins, and fubjedts the native to phlegmatic\nhumours, bloody fluxes, jaundice, and the whole train of hyfterical\naffedtions. Mars occafions melancholy, difeafes of the lungs, fiftulas,\nhot ulcers, and putrefafclions. If Mercury co-operates with either of\nthefe ungracious planets, it is for the increafe of evil, adding frefti vio\u00ad\nlence to the diforder, and perhaps fooner inducing a fatal determination.\nBut the properties of fome bodily difeafes arife from the variety of\nfigns which poifefs the foregoing configurations upon the two angles.\u2014\nFor inftance.

And here it\nm ud be carefully noted, that, if none of the benevolent planets are con\u00ad\nfigurated with the malefics which poifefs the caufe of thefe various difor-\ndcrs.\nO\nriginal from\nmpw di im ir i ibr\nDigitized by Go^ gle\n\fu\nu\ni\ni\ni\nd\ni\ni\ni\n,\nu\nu\nu\ny\ni\ne\n-\nu\ni\ny\ni\nu\n\/\n.e\nu\n\/\ni\nil\nl\n|\nj\n;\n\/\n\/\nvvvvvv\n.\ni\nid\nu\n1\n1\nli\nu\n^\nl\n.\nu\ni\ny\n\/c\nM\n-\nc\nt\n:b\ni_\nu\nb\ne\n-w\n-p\nu\n-y\nu\nu\ny\nig\n438 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nders, nor to either of the luminaries in angular pofitions, then thefe\nbodily difeafes will be wholly incurable, and the blemiflies never to be\nremoved j but, if the benefics poflefs a confiderable (hare in the configu\u00ad\nrations which induce the caufe, or overcome the malefic rays by an equal\nor fuperior power, then the difeafes will be much more moderate, and\nthe blemifties not fo obvious, if more than barely difcernible. It muft\nhere, as in all other cafes of the like kind, be obferved, that the Wronger\nany ruling planet is, whether benefic or malefic, the more eminent and\npowerful its effecls will be ; and alfo that a planet is ftronger when ori\u00ad\nental than when occidental j wherefore a malefic planet orientally pofited\ngives blemifties; but an occidental, difeafes. It is likewile to be re\u00ad\nmarked, that, if the pofition of the planet inducing the caufe be very\nftrong, the defedt will be from the birth; but, if weak, it will aril'e\nfrom fome accident after birth.\nO f the natural B E N T and Q U A L IT Y of the M IN D .\nSuch is the do&rine of bodily accidents, as deducible from the face of\na genethliacal figure; but the qualities of the mind, as rational and\nmental, are judged of from the conftitution of Mercury with regard to\ndifferent figns and planets. That which appertains to the fenfe alone,\nor that renders it irrational, is confidered from the more corporeal ftate\nof the luminaries; that is, of the Moon and ftars configurated by fepa-\nration or application. But, fince the animal inclination is various, this\nfpeculation is contemplated from many and divers obfervations, accord\u00ad\ning to the diverfity of figns which contain Mercury and the Moon, or\nthe ruling ftars which have dominion in them, and that confer their in\u00ad\nfluences to the temper and quality of the mind ; together with the con\u00ad\nfigurations of thofe ftars which have refped to the Sun and the angles\nconfidered as to the proper and diftinft nature with which each of\nthem ad upon the mental motions of each individual. It is there\u00ad\nfore generally found that tropical figns render the native\u2019s mind highly\ningenious, full of invention, eager in the purfuit of moral and political\nknowledge, and of great fortitude and perfeverance. Double-bodied\nfigns agitate the mind with a variety of whimfical and very ufelefs pur-\nfuits, lead the tongue to loquacious habits, and induce to negligence and\nfolly. Fixed figns fortify the mind with prudence and virtue, and give\na bias to ceconomy, chaftity, and temperance. Again, oriental confi\u00ad\ngurations produce mental qualities of a ftrong and ingenious nature, free,\nopen, and undiffembled, quick of apprehenfion, conftant, judicious,\nbenevolent, and chafte; but the occidental ones ad upon the mind\nOriginal from\nKIEMJ v n QY Dl IP I i r I I P B A D V\nDigitized by Google\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y , < 3?\nin a very oppofite manner, inclining the native to proiligacy and intern*\nperance, and impairing the intelleft by a naturally vicious difpofition.\nIt is likewifea juft obfervation, that if the ftars which have dominiop\nare pofited in good places of the figure, and well configurated, they render\nthe mental endowments exquifitely perfeft, and induce to a general good\nfortune. This is moil remarkably obvious in thofe genitures which\nhave Mercury well configurated, and joined with the feparation or ap\u00ad\nplication of the Moon. But, if Mercury and the Moon are not thus\ndifpofed, or are afflifted by the evil rays of the malefics, they will even\nthen imprint the quality of their natures upon the foul, though not fo\nflrongly, but in a lefs obvious and more obfcure degree j not tending\nfo much to good fortune and advancement in the common concerns o f\nlife. Hence the property of the ruling planet, whether good or evij,\ninAils its own nature into the animal lpirit, with a power and energy\nequal to its predominancy in the heavens at the hour of birth j and this\nenergy is either ftrengthened or diminifhed, according to the force and\naftion of fubordinate configurations ; for thofe who, by reafon of ftrong\nmalefic rays, are prone to violence and injuflice, have not their vicious in\u00ad\nclinations hindered, unlcfs thefe evil rays are oppofed by fomc contrary\neffeft \u2022, but, if a contrary afpeft oppofes this familiarity of the malefics,\nthe evil inclination is then proportionally corrected, and the mind is\nmore eafily brought to a proper fenfe of its intemperate purfuits. By\nthe fame rule, thofe who are good and juft, becaufe born under a fami\u00ad\nliarity of benefit ftars, willingly and chearfully purfue a life of recti\u00ad\ntude and virtue j and, being naturally fortunate, as well as prudent, their\nundertakings generally prove advantageous and profitable; but, if a con\u00ad\ntrary afpeft oppofes this happy familiarity of the benefics, either a lefs\nexemplary conduft, or a more unprofitable purfuitof worldly concerns,\nis fure to mark the ebarafter of the native through all the different,\nflages of his life.\nThus far we have confidered the influences of Mercury and the Moon\nupon the mind of man, in a general way, unconnefted with the ope\u00ad\nration or effeft of any particular planet, which may happen to affutne the\ndominion, and thereby imprint its own peculiar influences upon the\nmental faculties, in proportion to its fuperiority over the other planets.\nLet us now turn our obfervation to that prodigious variety of affeftions\nof the animal or intelleftual part of man, which each diftinft planet is\nfound to produce, when they alone govern the mind at the time of\nbirth.\nNo. 22. 5 O Saturn\nDigitized by Google Original from\nV f l D t ' D I I R I i r I I D Q A Q V\n\f440 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nSaturn having alone the dominion of the mental faculties) and ruling\nMercury and the Moon, if he be eligibly fituated in refpeft of the world\nand the angles, will induce the native to an imperious and covetous\ndifpofition, remarkably fordid, felf-fufficient, and envious j but, if he\nbe but indifferently pofited in refpeft to the angles and the world, he\ndifpofes the mind to treacherous inclinations, fraught with fuperflition,\ncowardice, and meannefs. If he is found in a concordant familiarity\nwith Jupiter, and both in good pofitions of the figure, they qualify the\nmind with better inclinations, and difpofe it to a\u00a3ts of benevolence,\nprudence, and magnanimity ; but, if they are configurated in evil places\nof the figure, they work a contrary effeft, difpofing the mind to turbu\u00ad\nlence and cruelty, and to various atts of hypocrify and fraud. If Saturn\nbe in good afpedt with Mars, and well pofited in the figure, he difpofes\nthe inclination to great and arduous undertakings, remarkable for in\u00ad\ntrepidity and courage in war, and for a watchful, laborious, inflexible,\nand colle&ed, mind, though much difpofed to adts of violence, tyranny,\nand oppreffion; but, if they are found in bad pofitions of the figure, they\nproduce a mind given up to every fpecies of fraud and impofition, and\nwholly abandoned to impiety and wickednefs. If united to Venus, in\nelevated pofitions, he renders the mind libidinous and luftful, given to\ndiffipation and intemperance, but fubjedt to fufpicion and jealoufy in\nrefpeft of women ; but, if unhappily difpofed in thehoufes of the figure,\nhe will induce the mind to the raoft filthy uncleannefs, and to other adts\nof the bafeftand moft reproachful kind.

For, if Mercury and the Moon are in an in-\nconjunct pofition in refpedt of themfelves, or the oriental horizon, and\nare irradiated by contrary and malefic configurations, whereby fuperiors\nrule oroppofe, they thus conftitute various difeafes in the qualities of the\nmind; the particular fpecies of which is known from the qualities of the\nliars which poflefs the places. Hence it is obvious that the more mo\u00ad\nderate difeafes of the mind have their radical caufe from an excefs or\ndefeat of thofe operations which induce the mental qualities; for, the\npredominancy of fuch qualities naturally promotes an excefs of evil, and\nconftitutes a difeafe, in proportion as the ambient matter is unmixed, and\nabove or below a proper mediocrity; but the more obvious and fatal\ndifeafes of the mind arife from a difproportion or defeft of matter infinite\nly greater, and wholly befide nature.\nThofe who are born when Mercury and the Moon are inconjundl,\neither in refpe\u00a3t of themfelves or the oriental horizon, Saturn and Mars\nbeing angular, and beholding the configuration. Mars by night, and\nSaturn by day, will be naturally fubjeft to the falling ficknefs all their\nlives; but, if Saturn happens to take this pofition by night, and Mars by\nday, the native will be fubje\u00a3l to phrcnzy and madnefs, more efpecially\nif the afpe\u00a3t fall in Cancer, Virgo, or Pifces. Again, if the Moon,\n\u25a0being in her phafis, is overcome by malefic rays, namely, by the con\u00ad\ncurrence of Saturn when approaching to a new, or by Mars at her full,\neither in the figns Sagittarius or Pifces, whoever is born under fuch con\u00ad\nfigurations will be fubjeft to lunacy. Therefore the malefic flars, over\u00ad\ncoming or predominating in any configuration, induce a variety of\nmental difeafes, which are either remarkably violent, or obfeure and la\u00ad\ntent, according to the nature and energy of each refpe&ivc ruling planet.\nIf the benevolent planets Jupiter and Venus have familiarity, in ori\u00ad\nental pofitions, and angular, with the malefics occidentally poflted,\nthefe mental difeafes, though ftrong and violent, will be curable; if\nJupiter prefides, they will be moved by medical help; but, if Venus,\nby the natural llrength of the mental faculties. But, if thefe pofitions\nhappen to be reverl'ed, the malefic ftars angular, and in oriental ftations,\nand the benefics fetting, the difeafes will become more manifell, and\nbe wholly incurable. Hence we derive the caufe of the ever-varying\nmutation of the animal fpirits, which are always more or lefs affe&ed\nin proportion as Mercury and the Moon are agitated by the good or evil\ninfluences of other concurring and adjuvant caufes.\nSuch\nDigitized by\nGoogle Original from\nMCl fi \/ Dl ID I Ir I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 44$\nSueh are the morbid affe&ions in the adtive part of the rational foul,\nproduced by the planetary configurations, but the great change which\narifes in the patient, that is, in the irrational part of the foul*, is in\u00ad\nduced chiefly from excefs or defied!, according to the particular confor\u00ad\nmation of male or female, in which they either exceed, or are deficient, in\nthe parts proper to their fex. For it is found, that, if the Sun be configu\u00ad\nrated with the Moon in the place of Mercury, and Mars and Venus have\nfamiliarity with them, the luminaries being in mafcnline figns, the\nmen will exceed in that which is natural, having thofe parts in excefs\nthat are proper to man; and the woman will have a conformation of\nparts preternatural and mixed. But, if Mars and Venus fhould be one\nor both conftituted with them after a mafculine manner, the men will\nbe fubjeot to mixtures of fex, and the women to violent luft and intem\u00ad\nperate vw.ntonnefs. If Venus alone be difpofed after a mafculine manner,\nthis fenfation will be lefs ftrong, and the parties will condutl themfelves\nwith more decency and modefty; but, if Mars and Venus both are fo\nconftituted, they will be moved to carnal embraces by the molt violent\nand irrefiitible fenfations.\nIf the luminaries alone are configurated in feminine figns, the women\nthen born will be of immoderate conformation, and will have ftrong and\ncontinual defires after men; but the men then born will be changed to\nthat conformation which is inferior to nature, and will inherit an effe\u00ad\nminate and tender conftitution of body and parts. And, if Venus be\ndifpofed with them in a feminine manner, the women will be more la-\nfeivious and prone to veneryj and, in whatever line of life they chance\nto glide, this paflion will always be prodominant, and moft probably\nfubjedl them to difgrace and infamy. The men under this conftitutioa\nare ftill more effeminate and impotent; but, if Mars be thus conftituted\ninflead of Venus, they become robuft and vigorous, and luft after women.\nThe oriental or diurnal configuration of Mars and Venus contribute\nto a more mafculine and robuft conformation, but the occidental and\nvefpertine to their being more effeminate and debilitated.

From thefe the\nfpeculations naturally follow which regard the contingencies of them ;\nwhereof thofe appertaining to temporal poflefiions feem peculiarly to\nagree with what concerns the body, and thofe which relate to honour\nand dignity feem more particularly to flow from the qualities of the\nmind.\nTo afeertain, therefore, the kind and quality of worldly pofleflions,\nin any rational degree, we are to confider of the pofition of the Part of\nFortune, with the nature and ftrength of the planet which rules it, to\u00ad\ngether with his configurations and pofitions in refpedt to other ftars.\nFor, whatever planet aflumes the lordlhip of the Part of Fortune, if ftrong\nand well dignified, he will afl'uredly contribute wealth and riches, but\nmore abundanty and lafting when the luminaries give teftimony to him\nby irradiating the place of his pofition. It is to be obferved that Saturn\ngives an increafeof wealth by the improvement and cultivation of lands,\nor by buildings or navigation. Jupiter contributes riches by the con\u00ad\nfidence and love of friends, which produce legacies and patrimony ; alfo\nby preferment in the church. Mars conduces to wealth by warfare, in\u00ad\ntrepidity, and good generalfhip. Venus, by friendlhip, gifts, and mar\u00ad\nriage.

And, if thofe ftars, which are\nof the fame nature with the fignificator of the Part of Fortune, give tefti\u2014\nmony of dominion, the pofleflion will remain with the native; but, if thofe\nof a contrary quality are elevated above the lord which has dominion, the\npofleflion will be of no duration, and future riches precarious. The ge\u00ad\nneral time of thefe events is taken from the inclination of the ftars which\nproduce the caufe in refpedt to the angles and fucceedents.

If they are pofited in fuccedents, the riches will\nprefent themfelves at a middle age; if in cadent houfes, either late or\nin extreme old age.

Wherefore, if both the luminaries at the time of\nbirth are found in mafculine figns, angular, and attended by the five\nplanets, the Sun by oriental ftars, and the Moon by occidental, thofe\nperfons will afpire to extraordinary power and dignity, and exercife au\u00ad\nthority and dominion over others, from whence great tribute and ho\u00ad\nnour will flow. And if thefe forrounding planets are angular, or con\u00ad\nfigurated to a cardinal houfe above the earth, they will be great and\npowerful in a fuperior degree; but flill more fo, if the attending planets\nmake a dexter configuration to the angles above the earth, with the Sun\nin a mafculine fign, and the Moon in a feminine ; for then the native\nwill arrive to a power like that of princes, having abfolute dominion and\ngovernment, difpofing, in a comparative degree, of the iflues of life and\ndeath.\nBut if the luminaries happen to be thus pofited, and none of the fur\u00ad\nrounding planets are in angular ftations, nor give teftimony to the angles, the\nnative will be great and honourable as a magiftrate or general, but not\nas having dominion or princely dignity. So if the furrounding planets\nare fome or mod of them in angular ftations, or configurated to the\nangles, yet, if the luminaries are not in angular pofitions alfo, the native\nwill not arrive to fuch illuftrious preferment, and will but moderately\nexcel in dignity and honour. But, if neither of the attending planets is\nconfigurated to the angles, the native will be obfcure, and pals his whole\nlife without promotion or dignity ; and if neither of the luminaries 2re at\nthe fame time found in a mafculine fign, nor angular, nor attended by\nthe benefic rays of good planets, the native\u2019s life will be abjeS and mife-\nrable, and his fortune hard.\nNo. 22. 5 CL Thus\nOriginal from\nM P\/i\/ Di i m 1r 1 i d d a\nDigitized by Go*, gle\n\f44S A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nThus the general confederation and mutability of dignity and honour\nis fought out and determined. But many things between the two ex\u00ad\ntremes of dignified ftation and abjedt fervility muft be taken into the\naccount, before any reafonable judgment can be formed from the native\u2019s\ngeniture ; for we muft recolleti, that every perfon born under the fame\npropitious configuration cannot alike arrive to the felf-fame height of\ndignity and honour, becaufe the difference of birth and ftation will at\nonce deftroy the poflibility of it ; not to fay any thing of crofs afpedls,\nand other baneful familiarities, which may either cut the thread of.\nlife, or tend to leffen the grateful influences of benefic configurations.\nIt therefore follows, that we are not only to judge of perfonal honour\nand dignity, under certain reftriftions, from the nature, quality, and\nplace of birth, but likewifefrom a due confideration of all occurring and\nfubordinate rays, which may in any fhape be liable to affedt the fignifi-\ncators of dignity.

But, if Jupiter gives teftimony,\nthe native will afpire after fome eminent office, or place of truft under\ngovernment; or to fome poll; of honour, or official department in the\nftate ; or will obtain fome honourable profeffion in the navy or army by\na perfeverance in that line.\nIf Mars is ruler of the profeffion, and irradiated by the Sun, he leads\nto all thofe branches of the mechanics which are wrought by the\noperation of fire ; whence he produces all the artificers in brafs and iron,\nand the workers and refiners of metals. But, being in conjunction with\nthe Sun, he influences to hulbandry, agriculture, and working in wood\nand ftone. If Saturn gives teftimony to him, he carries the inclination\ntowards a feafaring life, or to a love of gain by travelling, or by traffic\nin foreign countries, or by dealing in Haves or cattle. If Jupiter gives\nteftimony, the native\u2019s profeffion will be that of the army or navy, or\nfome place, office, or employment, dependent thereon.\nIf Mercury and Venus are fo configurated in the geniture as to be\u00ad\ncome joint rulers of the profeffion, they will produce excellent mufi-\ncians, and good compilers of mufical pieces ; alfo, mufical inftrument\nmakers, compofers of fongs and glees, and admirable fingers ; likewife\ncomedians, opera dancers, tumblers, and all the tribe of exhibitionifts.\nAnd, if Saturn gives teftimony, he will make jewellers, toymen, and\ndealers in ornaments and precious ftones. But, if Jupiter gives teftimony\nto them, he will difpofe the mind to the ftudy of politics, or of national\nand conftitutional law ; or he will make the profeffion that of a teacher\nor fchoolmafter, or the ruler and manager of fome public feminary of\nlearning.\nIf Mars and Mercury are joint lords of the profeffion, they lead the\ninclination to the choice of painting or drawing; to ftatuary, fculpture,\ncarving, engraving, and fuch-like ingenious arts. But, becaufe the hap\u00ad\npy configurations which confpire to the production of talents proper for\nthefe purfuits are not often to be found in any geniture, without fome\nmalevolent\nOriginal from\nMcur v n o v di ipi i r i i r p a r v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 451\nmalevolent or affliCting rays, whereby the native\u2019s genius is impaired, it\nfeldom happens that we find very high perfection, or fuper-extraordinary\nmerit, among the numerous profelTors and followers of the polite arts *\nwhence comes the foundation of the common faying, fo ftri&ly confor\u00ad\nmable to truth and reafon, that painters, poets, and muficians, mud be\nfo bom ; that is, mud inherit from nature a ftrong bias for either of\nthefe profeflions, to make any extraordinary progrefs in them. And it\nis remarkable, that, if Saturn gives teftimony to this joint rule of Mars\nand Mercury, all the above ingenuity and tafte will be dcftroyed, and\nthe native become wholly untradable and indolent, and given up to\ntheft, fwindling, fharping, and other fpecies and fraud and violence, for\nthe means of a fubfiftence.\nIf Mars and Venus jointly take dominion of the profeflion, they pro\u00ad\nduce workers and dealers in various kinds of metals; likewife hufband-\nmen, apothecaries, and phyficians, and all profeflions in the nature of\nplants and herbs. If Saturn gives teftimony to them, they will make\nignorant pretenders to mufic and divinity ; and, in all other profeflions\nunder this configuration, the native will betray a want of ingenuity and\ncapacity. But, if Jupiter gives teftimony, the contrary effects will hap\u00ad\npen ; and, in whatever purfuit the native engages, proper to this mixture\nof the ruling planets, he will have the fatisfadion of deriving both ho\u00ad\nnour and profit from his labours.\nIt muff: alfo be obferved, that the quality of the flgns in which thefe\ncongrefles arc made, and wherein the lords of the profeflion are pofited,\nconfers to the variety and advantage of fuch profeflion. Thofeof human\nfhape conduce amazingly to the perfection of all thofe fciences and avo\u00ad\ncations which are for the improvement and information of the mind.\nFour-footed flgns contribute to the greater perfection of metallic arts,\nnavigation, and architecture. Tropical and equinoCiial flgns forward\nthe purfuits of hufbandry, agriculture, the mathematics, chemiftry,\nand theology. Earthy and watery flgns to the perfection of phyfic and\nfurgery, to the art of conftruCting fhips, and to the profeflion of a\nmerchant.\nAgain, if the Moon poflefles the place of the profeflion, having confi\u00ad\nguration with Mercury, at her conjunction with the Sun, either in\nTaurus, Capricorn, or Cancer, flie will conduce to greater fagacity and\npenetration in whatever profeflion the native happens to follow. If this\nconfiguration happens in Sagittarius or Pifces, it conduces to a melan\u00ad\ncholy and timid purfuit of bufinefs, and burthens the mind with enthu-\nNo. 23. 5 R fiaftic\nDigitized by Goi sle Original from\nm p a \/ v n o k ' D i i m i r i i r r a r v\n\f4 $ 2 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nfiaftic and fuperftitious affe&ions. If it happens in Virgo or Scorpio, it\ncontributes profound wifdoin and knowledge to the profeffion of phy-\nficians, lawyers, or divines; and to the followers of l'cience or philofo-\nphy. If in Libra, Aries, or Leo, it makes enthufiaftic preachers, and\nfills the mind with idle and immoderate ideas of gain by each refpedtive\nbufinefs or avocation.\nThus the kinds and qualities of profeffions are to be fought out in a\ngeneral way, and deferibed accordingly; but the importance and extent\nof them muft be confidered from the ftrength and dignity of the ruling\nftars. For, being oriental or angular, they make the profeffion eminent\nand profitable; but, if occidental, or declining from angles, it will be\nunimportant, mean, and unprofitable. If the benefics are fuperior, the\nprofeffion will be eminent, honourable, and conducive to great riches ;\nbut, if the malefics are fuperior, it will be mean, inglorious, and wholly\nunprofitable. Saturn is found to deftroy the benefits of an attive pro\u00ad\nfeffion by tardinefs, indifference, and inactivity: but Mars through\nboldnefs, loftinefs, and prefumption ; wherefore both aft in oppofition\nto the fuccefs and advantage of the native\u2019s profeffion. But the general\ncaufes of the failure or profperity of bufinefs muft be judged of from\nthe difpofition and quality of the ftars which produce this effect; and\nthis in reference to the oriental and occidental angles. The eaft angle\ndenotes the beginning of life; the weft angle the end ; and the mid\u00ad\nheaven the middle part, from about thirty to forty years: and, as the\nfignificators are difpofed in the radical figure, fo will the effects thereof\nbe at the let time of life conformable thereto.\nIt muft be ever remembered that the doCtrine of profeffions here laid\ndown, and the effefts arifing from them, relates only to fuch as are fol\u00ad\nlowed in confequence of the natural impulfeof the mind; in which cafes\nalone we are to feck for adequate fuccefs and perfeflion in the profecu-\ntion of them. Among the obfervations we make of the common Occur\u00ad\nrences of life, we too often find youth configned to fuch employments,\nby the wiil or caprice of their parents, as they are neither defigned for\nby nature nor have the leaft inclination to follow. And hence it\nis that fo many bunglers rife up in all trades and profeffions, who, finding\ntheir bufinefs a continual load of oppreffion and perplexity, either aban\u00ad\ndon it altogether, or elfe become indolent, fottilh, and inactive, to the\nutter ruin to their families and to the general annoyance of the more\ninduftrious part of mankind. From this confideration, parents and\nguardians Ihould be careful to educate and bring up the riling generation,\nas far as prudence will admit, according to the natural bent and genius\ni of\nOriginal from\nm p u \/ v n o ^ d i i m i r i i q d a d v\nDigitized by Got. ale\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 453\nof their own inclinations, which is the only diredl road to excellence\nand perfe&ion. This I think is a fadt that needs no further illuftration,\nfince the obfervations of mod men will furnilh them with inftances of\nperfons being regularly bred to fome profefiions, which even at an ad\u00ad\nvanced time of life they wholly abandon, in purfuit of fome other calling\nmore confonant to their nature and abilities, and in which they often\nfucceed, to the aftonifliment to their competitors.\nOf M A R R I A G E .\nTo What has been faid follows the confideration of marriage, or the\nfit conjundlion and living together of man and woman, according to the\ndivine ordinance of thefupreme Being. And, as this law was evidently\ne(labli(hed from the beginning of things, as well for the propagation of\nthe fpecies as for the mutual comfort and happinefs of the fexes, it were\nfenfelefs to fuppofe human nature void of the impulfe of reciprocal love;\nor that the involuntary adtions of the foul, by which it is moved towards the\nobjedt of its affedtions, have not a radical caufe in the order of nature.\nIf this be admitted, it cannot furely be deemed a fubjedt of ridicule, to\nbelieve that this, as well as the other important tranfadtions of our lives,\nmay be fought out by a contemplation of the celeflial bodies.\nTo inveftigate this point, therefore, in refpedt to men, let the pofi-\ntions and conftitutions of the Moon be particularly confidered. For,\nwhen (he is found in the oriental quadrants at the time birth, (he\ninfluences the native to the confummation of marriage at an early period\nof his life 5 but, if pofited in the occidental quadrants, he will probably\nlive Angle till the approach of old age, and then marry a very young\nwoman. If the Moon be afflidted by the Sun-beams, and in configura\u00ad\ntion with Saturn, in either of thefe pofitions the native will never marry\nat all. If (he be found in a fign of one form, and making application to\none planet only, the native will marry but once; but, if pofited in a bi\u00ad\ncorporal or fign of many forms, and making application to feveral (bars\nin the fame fign, he will be feveral times married. And, if the (bars\nwhich receive the Moon\u2019s application, either by a conjunction, fextile, or\ntrine, are benefic, the wives will be good and virtuous; but, if the ap\u00ad\nplication be made to malefic planets, and by evil configurations, they\nwill be altogether of an oppoiite defcription. Therefore, if Saturn re\u00ad\nceives the Moon\u2019s application, it indicates a laborious, but fullen, fro-\nward, and ungovernable, wife. If it be made to Jupiter, (he will be free,\nopen, and generous, truly virtuous, and a good houfewife. If to Mars,.\n* (he\nDigitized by G O O Q l e\nOriginal from\nMHAl v n o k ' Dl IP I Ir I I D D A D V\n\f454 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\n(he will be bold, ftubborn, and refradtory. If to Venus, chearful,\ncomplacent, affable, and chafte. If to Mercury, wife, prudent, loving,\nand conftant. But, if Mars irradiates the place, \u00a3he will be furly, pafi-\niionate, talkative, and unfteady.\nFor the particulars of marriage in refpedl of women, we are toconfider\nthe pofitions of the Sun, inftead of the Moon ; for, if he be fituated in\nthe oriental houfes, at the time of birth, the native will either marry very\nyoung, or elfe at an advanced time of life to a young man j but, if the\nSun be found in the occidental houfes, fhe will marry late, or to a man\nfar advanced in years. And alfo, if he be fituated in a fign of one form,\nfhe will marry but once; but, if in a fign of many forms, or configurated\nto many oriental ftars. Hie will have more huihands than one, who will\npartake of the fame nature and qualities as the Bars to which the confi\u00ad\ngurations are made. Thus, Saturn, if configurated to the Sun, will\nindicate fober, grave, and laborious, huihands, hut cold and phlegmatic.\nJupiter difpofes them to more opennels of mind, and generoiity. Mars\nmakes them violent, warm, unruly, pafiionate, and arbitrary. Venus\nforeihews them to be indulgent, fond, good-natured, and handfome.\nMercury difpofes them to be careful, prudent, induftrious, and faithful.\nBut, if Saturn be joined with Mercury, they will be churlilh and re-\nferved j if with Venus, they will be dull, four, and inconftant: if with\nMars, quick, lively, luilful, and fond of variety. Thofe are here to be\nconfidered the oriental quarters in refpedt of the Sun, which precede the\noriental and occidental fign of the zodiac j and, in refpedt of the Moon,\nthofe from her new and full to her other quarters ; and the occidental\nhoufes are thofe which fall oppofite to the foregoing.\nAs to events that occur after marriage, that is a different fpeculation,\nand requires great attention to the following particulars. Whenever the\ngeniture of both hufband and wife have the luminaries configurated in\nmutual agreement, that is, in trine or fextile to each other, they will\nlive together in comfort and harmony, and for a long continuance of\ntime, if the luminaries happen to be in mutual reception. And this du\u00ad\nration will flill be more firm and lafting, if the pofition of the hufband\u2019s\nMoon agrees with that of the Sun in the wife\u2019s geniture. But, if the\npofitions of the luminaries are placed in figns inconjuntt, and configu\u00ad\nrated by quartile or oppofition, they will either live together in difeord\nand enmity, and be rent by violent jealoufies and contention, or elfe be\nfully and finally eftranged from each other.\nAgain,\nOriginal from\nM C I M v n e v Dl ID I I r I I P D A R V\nDigitized by Gocigle\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 45;\nAgain, if the benefic rays of the fortunate planets behold the configu\u00ad\nrations of the luminaries in mutual reception, the marriage will be\ndurable, conftant, happy, and profitable; but, if the malefic planets\nirradiate thofe places, the marriage will be unhappy, contentious, and\nmiferable. If the luminaries are not configurated in mutual reception,\nyet if the benefics give teftimony to them, the marriage will be mode\u00ad\nrately happy and durable} and, when ftrife and difagreements happen,\nthe fame will wear off, and reconciliation will take place between them ;\nbut, if the malefics give teftimony to the difcordant pofitions of the lu\u00ad\nminaries, inconftancy and infidelity will enfue, and the marriage will\nbe diffolved with fcandal and difgrace. If Mercury be joined with the\nmalefics, the reparation will be for hatred and diflike, and by mutual\nconfent; but, if Venus gives teftimony to them, it will be a divorce, by\ndue courfe of law, for infidelity and adultery.\nMarriages, in other refpe&s, are confidered from the familiarities and\nconnexions of Venus, Mars, and Saturn. For, if thefe are all three\nconfigurated with the luminaries, the marriage will be good, domeftic,\nand profitable; by reafon of the affinity which the benefic planet Venus\nhath with Mars and Saturn; with Mars, becaufe of youth and florid coun\u00ad\ntenance, feeing they have exaltation in mutual trigonal figns, as Mars in\nCapricorn the triplicity of Venus, and Venus in Pifces the triplicity\nof M ars; or Mars in Pifces the exaltation of Venus, and Venus in\nCapricorn the exaltation of Mars. So likewife Capricorn and Libra are\ncommon to Saturn and Venus; for Venus in Libra hath houfe, and Sa\u00ad\nturn triplicity ; and in Capricorn Saturn hath houfe, and Venus tripli\u00ad\ncity ; and hence fhe bears relation to Saturn by an older complexion,\nfeeing they have their houfes trigonal to each other. Wherefore Venus\nwith Mars conduces to make the inclinations more fond and amorous;\nand Mercury, giving teftimony to them, qualifies the paffions, and keeps\nthe fenfual appetite within rational bounds. If Venus be found in any\nof the above familiar and promifcuous figns, fhe indicates marriages be\u00ad\ntween kinfmen and relations; or, if fhe be with the Moon in a maf'cu-\nline geniture, it predicts that two fillers, or near relations, will be mar\u00ad\nried to the fame man; but, if fhe be thus configurated to Jupiter, or the\nSun, in a feminine geniture, it fhews the woman will marry two bro\u00ad\nthers, or two men that are nearly related.\nIt is likewife obfervahle, that, in all cafes where Venus is thus con\u00ad\nfigurated to Saturn, in the place of marriage, the connubial ftate\nwill be blifsful and happy to the native; and, if Mercury be joined\nwith them, he adds profperity 4 but, if Mars be fubftituted in his place.\nNo. 23. 5 S . the\nOriginal from\nM E W i \/ V n R I ^ Dl I R I 1r 1 I R B\nDigitized by Go(. ale\n\f456 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthe marriage will be altogether wretched, contentious, and unhappy.\nIf Mars be configurated to Venus, Saturn, and Mercury, the native\nmarries with a perfon nearly of an equal age; but, if he be pofited in an\noriental or eafterly ftation, the native marries with a perfon much youn\u00ad\nger ; and, if in an occidental or wefterly ftation, with a perfon much older.\nIf Venus and Saturn be found in promifeuous figns, fuch as Capricorn\nor Libra, the native will marry among his own kindred ; but, if this\nconfiguration is made upon the cufps of the horofeope or mid-heaven,\nirradiated by the Moon, and the geniture be mafeuline, the native will\nluft after his own lifter, aunt, or mother-in-law; or, if the geniture be\nfeminine, {he will have defire unto her own brother, uncle, or daugh\u00ad\nter\u2019s hufband. Should the Sun irradiate the place, inftead of the Moon,\nthen the males will have defire toward their daughters, or fon\u2019s wife ;\nand the females to their fons, nephews, or lifter\u2019s hulband.\nObfervation likewife proves, that, if Venus and Saturn are configu\u00ad\nrated neither in a mafeuline nor feminine fign, but in thofe of an oppo-\nfite quality, which are alike in fex, but contrary in nature; or in thofe\nthat are ruled by places of a contrary nature, as Capricorn is ruled by\nSaturn and Mars, and Pifces by Jupiter and Venus; the native will be\nprone to luft, of a loofe converfation, and immodeft carriage ; more par\u00ad\nticularly if the configuration be made in the firft or latter degrees of\nAries, near the Hyades, in the latter degrees of Leo, or upon the face\nof Capricorn. And, if thefe planets occupy the two principal angles,\nnamely, the afeendant or mid-heaven, thefe libidinous affettions will be\nthe more ftrong, open, and oftenfive, making the party glory, as it were,\nin lafeivioufnefs and debaucheries; but it is a moft extraordinary cir-\ncumftance, that the fame afpedts in the northern and weftern angles not\nonly conduce to an oppofite difpofition, but render the native either\nbarren, deficient, or of evil conformation, in refpedt to the parts necef-\nfary to generation.\nThe difpofition of men, as to modeft or vicious habits, very much de\u00ad\npends on the pofition and configurations of Mars; for, if he be feparat-\ning from Saturn and Venus, and applying to Jupiter, men born at that\ntime will be difereet and modeft, decent in their intercourfes with the\nother fex, and difpofed only to the natural ofe. If Jupiter and Venus be\nconfigurated to Saturn and Mars, the native will be eafily moved on, and\nhave a fecret defire to adts of venery; but will have an external (hew of\nchaftity, and labour to avoid the {hame. If Mars and Venns are alone\nconfigurated together, or if Jupiter bears teftimony, the native will be\nopenly lafeivious, and indulge in the ofoft luxuriant enjoyments of the\noppofite\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM P U \/ v n B k ' D I I D I i r I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 457\noppofite fex. If one of thefe planets be oriental, and the other occi\u00ad\ndental, he will be difpofed towards men as well as women; but, if both\nare found configurated in the occidental quarters, the native\u2019s company\nfhould be avoided, for he will burn with unnatural defires after men or\nboys; more particularly if the afpecl falls in mafculine figns, in which\ncafe the inclination is moft aftonilhingly moved towards this infamous\nand {hocking prafclice. It is likewife to be remarked, that, if Venus be\nalone in an occidental pofition, the native will for the moft part have\nintercourfe with none but the meaneft and moft proftituted part of the\nfex; but, if Mars be alone in this pofition, he influences to greater delicacy\nand faftidioufnefs, and marks the character with a defire after married wo\u00ad\nmen, or to the more continent and modeft among the {ingle ones.\nSuch are the caufes which vary the fenfual appetites of men; we will\nnow confider thofe peculiar to women.\u2014If Venus be configurated to\nJupiter, and Mercury gives teftimony, the native will be fober, pure,\nand moderate in her defires after men; but, having familiarity with Mer\u00ad\ncury alone, (he will privately give herfelf up to fenfual embraces, though\nremarkably coy and referved in public. So likewife, if Venus be con\u00ad\nfigurated to Mars alone, the native will be wanton and lafcivious ; and, if\nMercury has familiarity with them, (he will be wholly given up to luft-\nful pleafures and proftitution. If Jupiter concurs in this afpctl, and\nMars be combuft of the Sun, the native will be mean and abjed, fub-\nmitting to the ufe of the moft vulgar and loweft clafs of mankind; but,\nif Venus be combuft inftead of Mercury, {he will fubmit with more re-\nferve and caution, and moftly with decent and genteel perfons. If thefe\nplanets be configurated after a feminine manner, the fenfual appetite of the\nnative will be only paffive; but, if difpofed after a mafculine manner, it\nwill be a&ive alfo. Saturn, having familiarity with thefe configurations,\nadds to the greater luft and licentioufnefs; but Jupiter to a greater {hare\nof modefty, decency, and external decorum.\nOf C H I L D R E N .\nAfter the confideration of marriage follows that of children. This fpe-\nculation is deduced from the ftars configurated in the midheaven, or\nfuccedent, which is the eleventh houfe ; but, if none of the planets are\nfound in thefe places, then the oppofite ones are to be confidered. The\nMoon, Jupiter, and Venus, are the givers of children; but the Sun,\nMars, and Saturn, occafion llerility, or paucity of children. Mercury,\nas in all other cafes, contributes his influences according to the nature\nand quality of that ftar or planet with which he is configurated ; adding\nto the increafe of children when in the eaft, but tofterility and barren-\nnefs\nDigitized by Got. szle Original from\nMP\/ii v n e t ' Di i m 1r 1 i b b a b v\n\f45S A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nnefs when occidental, or in the weft. When therefore thefe ftars which\nare givers of children, are thus pofited, and by themfelves, they fore-\nIhew only one child to the native ; but, if they are formed in double-bo\u00ad\ndied or feminine figns, they caufe the generating of twins : fo likewife, in\nfruitful figns, as Pifces, Cancer, or Scorpio, they will produce two or\nthree children at a birth. If they are of a mafculine nature, by being\nconfigurated to the Sun, and in mufculine figns, they caufe males j but,\nif they are difpofed after a feminine nature, they give females. If they\nare overcome by malefic planets, and pofited in barren places or figns,\nfuch as Leo or Virgo, they will give children, but not of any liability\nor duration ; they will be naturally weak and puny, by being void of a\nproper lhare of vital heat and nourilhment. If the Sun and malefic ftars\njointly polTefs the midheaven or eleventh houfe, in mafculine or fterilo\nfigns, without either of the benefics concurring, they indicate perpetual\nbarrennefs to the native, and (hew an utter want of children ? but, if they\nbe in feminine or fruitful figns, or aided by the benefics, they forelhew\nthe production of children, but fuch as are either hurt or blemilhed in\ntheir bodies, or of a Ihort and unhealthy life.\nIn all thefe cafes it muft be remembered, that whenever the malefic\nftars have the dominion, and the benefics give teftimony, being configu\u00ad\nrated in, or having refpedt to, prolific figns, there will happen a reje&ion\nof children according to the excefs which the ftars giving teftimony have\nin each condition, either of all the children, or of a few, or moft, as they\nare found more powerful, by being more oriental or angular, or more ele\u00ad\nvated or fuccedent. If therefore the lords of thofe figns, being givers of\nchildren, are orientally pofited, or in good places of the figure, the chil\u00ad\ndren will be fortunate and afpiring, and will arrive at Angular fame and\nhonour: but, if the pofition be occidental, or in evil places of the figure,\nthe children will be altogether mean and obfcure. Moreover, if they\nagree with the part of fortune and horofcope, they forelhew mutual love\nand confidence, and a good underftanding always to exift between the\nchildren and parents, and that they will become the heirs and inheritors\nof their fortunes; but, if thefe be found unconjoined and difiigreeing, the\nchildren will be vicious and incorrigible, lofing the efteem, and wearing\nout the patience, of their parents, and thereby perhaps miffing the inhe\u00ad\nritance of their fubftance. If the ftars which alfume the dominion of\nchildren are agreeably configurated among themfelves, they forelhew love\nand harmony among brothers and fillers, and that they will help and\naffift one another during their lives. But, as to other particulars rela\u00ad\ntive to the fortunes and general purfuit of children, they are to be fought\nout by placing the fign and degree in which the fignificator of children\nl is\ngitized by G O O f i k\nOriginal from\nm c i a \/ v r i D ^ m ip i i r i i p r a b v\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y. 459\nis found, upon the afcendant, and making the figns upon the cufps of\nall the other houfes agreeable thereto, in the fame manner as if it was\nthe proper nativity of each child, and then judge of the difpofition of\nthe figure, according to the rules heretofore laid down.\nO f F R I E N D S and E N E M I E S .\nThe things which relate to friendfhip and enmity are confidered by\nobferving the principal places of the geniture wherein the fignificators\nthereof have familiarity or afpedt, together with the weaknefs or ftrength\nof them. The great and more durable familiarities or differences of thefc\nftars are termed fympathies and enmities ; and the fmall and temporary\nfamiliarities are called focieties and contentions. To difeover thefe, we\nmuft carefully obferve the places of the Sun and Moon, in refpedt to the\nhorofeope and part of fortune; for, if thefe happen in the fame figns, or\nif they change places when rifing, ,and not more than feventeen degrees\ndiftant, they forefhew long and faithful friendfhip; but, if they are in-\nconjundl, or pofited in oppofite figns, they produce great and implacable\nenmity and hatred. If the luminaries are not found in any of thefe fi-\ntuations, but are only configurated in figns, either by trine or fextile,\nthey (hew flight and precarious friendfhip; but, if by quartile, fmall and\nimpotent enmity. Hence it happens- that friendfhips ceafe and appear\nas it were at an utter end, while the malefics tranfit the configuration ;\nand yet, when thefe are over, the friendfhip is again renewed, and\nmutual civilities and good offices take place, as if no fuen circumftance\nhad happened. So in like manner the malicious objedts of hatred and\nenmity feem to ceafe and lie dormant, when the benefic ftars are making\ntheir ingrefs upon the configuration ; but are renewed with frefh ran\u00ad\ncour foon after thefe ingrefles are at an end.\nFriendfhip and enmity are therefore confidered under three kinds ; for\nmen are obferved to be fo difpofed either by eledtion, or for profit, or\nfor forrow or pleafure ; and when either all or moft of the forementioned\nplaces have familiarity with each other, friendfhip is conftitutcd by thefe\nthree kinds; but, if thefe places are found unagreeable, then enmity arifes\nin a fimilar manner. When the places of the luminaries alone have fa\u00ad\nmiliarity, friendfhip will arife from eledtion, involuntary choice, or na\u00ad\ntural regard, which is the moft firm and lafting; but, if the places of the\nluminaries are contrarily difpofed, hatred is in the fame manner pro\u00ad\nduced, and is the moft inveterate and fatal.

But\nin all thefe cafes we mult particularly obferve the ftars elevated above or\nconfigurated with each of thefe refpeflive places ; for that place (hall give\na higher degree of friendfhip or enmity than any other, to which the\nelevation or fucceflion of ftars is the neareft, whether in the fame fign\nor the adjoining. But the place which pafles the ftars in configuration,\nif the ftars are friendly, denotes advantage and intereft to be the caufe of\nfriendfhip; or, if difeordant ftars occur, enmity will arife from interefted\nmotives, which will expire with the caufe of it.\n\/\n\/\n\/ The foregoing obfervations are applicable to the moft extravagant and\n\/ lafting inftances of friendfhip and enmity j but thofe which arife from\nmore temporary and trivial caufes have a different fpeculation. The\ncommon occafions of friendfhip or animofity, which arife in the general\npurfuit of bufinefs or pleafure, or which arife from mixing with the\nworld, are only to be deduced from the motion of the ftars taken in\nboth genitures, in order to find when the fignificators in one nativity\nfhall come to the fame point in the other nativity; for at fuch periods\nthere will arife particular friendfhips or enmities, which will have du\u00ad\nration no longer than the refpeflive familiarity or connexion of thefe\nftars exift. Saturn and Jupiter, coming in this manner to each other\u2019s\nplaces, caufe friendfhip by meeting in focieties or company; or by agree\u00ad\nment in hufbandry and agriculture, or by the joint inheritance of for\u00ad\ntunes. Saturn and Mars produce ftrife and contention, and often fore-\nihew premeditated fraud and villainy. Saturn and Venus denote loveand\nfriendfhip through the interference of kindred, but it hath no duration.\nSaturn and Mercury produce friendfhip by converfation or connexion in\nbufinefs, fcience, or confederacy. Jupiter and Mars produce enmity by\npolitics, improper perferment, or interefted meafures of government.\nJupiter and Venus occafion friendfhip through the interference of wo\u00ad\nmen, ecclefiaftics, or teachers; Jupiter and Mercury through mutual\nattachment to literature, fcience, and philofophy; Mars and Venus\ncaufe friendfhip by a like difpofilion to lafeivioufnefs, diflipation, and\nintemperance; Mars and Mercury produce enmity by fimilar interefts\nin bufinefs, or by the fame parties following the fame avocation; but\nVenus and Mercury by means of jealoufy, learning, correfpondence by\nletter, or love of women.\nThe increafe or decreafe of friendfhip and enmity is difeerned from the\nnature of the poffeffed places of each fignificator, compared with the\n1 firft\nv\nDigitized by C j O O Q I C\nOriginal from\nK \\ C \\ h l Dl ID I Ir I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y .\nfirft four principal places of the figure > for, if they apply to the place of\nthe part of fortune, or to the luminaries angular, they render the friend-\nlhip or enmity more confpicuous; but, feparated and disjoined, they\nmake them obfcureand fecret. To know whether thefe affedtions lhall\nbe more or lefs injurious or advantageous, we are to obferve the force\nand power of the liars which behold the above-mentioned places, and\njudge according to their quality and difpolition either to good or evil.\nBut, if it relates to good or evil from fervants, the place of the ruling\ndifpofition in refpedl of them in the figure mull be taken from the fign.\nin the twelfth houfe, and from the liars which behold the place in the\ngeniture itfelf, with the ingrelfes or oppofition ; but more particularly\nwhen the rulers of the figns have either familiarity with the principal\nplaces of the geniture, or are contrarily and unhappily configurated;\nfrom which judgment mull be made accordingly.\nOf the Natural INCLINATION for TRAVELLING.\nThe circumllances which relate to travelling are confidered from the\npofition of the luminaries in refpedl to the angles, but chiefly from thofe\nof the Moon; for, if Ihe be found in the feventh houfe, and declining\nfrom angles, Ihe denotes a continual difpofition for travelling, and perpe\u00ad\ntual change of place, to the native. Mars himfelf being occidental, or\ndeclining from the midheaven, and having an oppofite or quartile pofi\u00ad\ntion to the luminaries, will produce the lame inclination in a fomewhat\nlefs degree. But, if the part of fortune falls in the fame fign with th?\nfignificator of travelling, the principal part of the life and adlions of\nthe native will be fpent in a foreign country.\nWhenever the benevolent planets irradiate the above-mentioned places\nof the luminaries, or Mars, or the part of fortune, or fucceed to them,\nthe native\u2019s 'travelling will be glorious and profitable, and his return\nfafe and without impediment; but, if the malevolent liars behold or\nfucceed, the contrary effedts will be found to happen. In all thefe cafes,\nhowever, the quality and temperament of the fmaller familiarities, asthey\nadd to or take from the power and force of their configurations, muft\nbe invariably attended to. If the luminaries incline or fall to the ori\u00ad\nental quadrants, the travelling will be towards the eaftern or fouthern\nparts of the globe, confidered in refpetl to the place of birth ; but, if\nthey are found in the occidental quadrants, the peregrination will be to\u00ad\nwards the north or well. If the figns in which the fignificators of tra\u00ad\nvelling are pofited be of one form, either in refpedt of themfelves, or\nof the flats which have the lordfhip over them, the travelling will be\nDigitized by G o g g l e Original from\nM H A l v n c i ' Dl ID I I r I I D R A D V\n\f462 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nfar, but at intervals; but, if the figns are double-bodied, or of two\nforms, it will be perpetual, and of vaft extent. It mud however be\nhere obferved, that, though the caufes and fuccefs of travelling are in\u00ad\nfluenced by Mars and the part of fortune, yet the quarter towards\nwhich the peregrination fhall be is only to be known from the pofi-\ntion of the luminaries.\nIf Jupiter and Venus are rulers both of the luminaries and places of\nthe figure which induce travelling, the journeys will not only be com\u00ad\npleted without danger, but they will alfo be pleafant, healthy, and\nagreeable ; for, by the good government of the countries be vifits, and\nthe accidental meeting of friends, he will meet with hofpitality and kind-\nnefs; the conftitution of the air, and the plenty of neceflary accommoda\u00ad\ntions, contributing at the fame time to his health and prefervation ; and,\nif Mercury be joined to the aforefaid configuration, an additional fhare of\nhonour, profit, and information, will be derived from the journey ; but,\nif Saturn and Mars poflefs or govern the places of the luminaries, at a\ngreat diftance from each other, they will occafion great dangers and a\nvariety of ill fortune in the courfe of the journey. Being in moift fignts,\nthey denote misfortune by Ihipwreck, or falling into defolate and inac-\nceflible places; in fixed figns, by precipices, or tempeftuous and con\u00ad\ntrary winds; in tropical and equinoctial figns, by want of provifions,\nby a fcorbutic or epidemic diforder, or by afickly temperature of the air;\nin human figns, by the fudden attack of mountaineers and robbers, of\nfavages, or ambufeades ; in earthy ligns, by the attack of wild and fe\u00ad\nrocious animals, or by falling into pits, or fubterraneous places; but\nif Mercury gives teftimony in any of the foregoing cafes, the danger\nmay arife from venomous creatures, or by poifon, or fome villainous\naccufation.\nThefe are the general confiderations ; but the more particular, fuch as\nrelate to the peculiar advantage or injury of each event, muft be deduced\nfrom the nature and property of the principal places and fignificators of\nprofeflion and fubftance, of dignity and honour, or of bodily and mental\nendowments, according to the rules already premiled. But the know\u00ad\nledge of the times when thefe various incidents are to happen is only to\nbe acquired from the refult of the directions of each refpeftive fignifi-\ncator, by the method which we fhall prefently recommend.\nOf\nDigitized by Gov ole Original from\nkipa\/ v n r v di ip 1i r 1IPp a r v\n\fOf the APHETA , HY LEG, PRORO G A TO R, or SIG N IFICA TO R\nof L IFE , and the Places proper thereto.\nThe aphetic, hylegiacal, or prorogatory, places, are thofe particular\nplaces of the figure, or of the heavens, from whence the apheta, hyleg,\nprorogator, or fignificator of life, is to be taken. Thefe appellations:\nhave all the fame meaning, and fignify that planet or ftar which is lord\nlife. The firft is derived from the Greek, the fecond from the Hebrew,\nand the latter from the Latin.\nThe hylegiacal or prorogatory places are in number five, viz, the\nafeendant, the feventh, ninth, tenth, and eleventh, houfes, and are ta\u00ad\nken from the five degrees next and immediately above the cufp of the\nafeendant to the twenty-five degrees below the cufp of the fame, com\u00ad\nputed by oblique afeenfion. In the fame manner the prorogatory places,\nare determined in the feventh, ninth, tenth, and eleventh, houfes; for\ninftance, it is computed from the five degrees in the eighth houfe, to\nthe middle of the eleventh houfe, towards the twelfth ; which middle\nis eafily found, by adding half the femidiurnal arch to the right afeenfion\nof the medium coeli, and where that ends is the middle of the eleventh\nhoufe ; the part beyond which is not hylegiacal or prorogatory. Now\nthefe only are the places in which the planet who afluines the power of\nhyleg or giver of life can be found $ for whatfoever is under the earth\nis not fit for fuch dominion j nor is any pafition above the earth, which\nhath not configuration to the horofeope. The twelfth houfe, therefore,\nwhich is called the evil angel, is not prorogatory, becaufe it not only de\u00ad\nclines from the angle, but alfo makes the influence of the flars polited\ntherein of an evil tendency, fince it difturbs, and as it were dellroys, the\nthick vappur proceeding from the moifture of the earth, whereby they\nbecome contrary to nature both in colour and magnitude.\nIf the native\u2019s birth be by day, the Sun fhall be taken for hyleg, pro\u00ad\nrogator, or giver of life, if he be found in any of the foregoing hylegiacal\nplaces ; if he be not,, then obferve whether the Moon be polited in either\nof them, and, if fo, then the fhall be taken for fignificator of life. But'\nif neither of the luminaries be fo found, then any planet whatfoever, that\nhath moft dignities in the place of the Sun at the preceding conjun&ion\nwith the Moon, and in the horofeope, -fhall be preferred as figniheator of\nlife. It muft however be remembered, that this planet muft be dignified\nthree ways or more, in one of the above-mentioned places, to be fo pre\u00ad\nferred ; but, if no planet fhould be found fo dignified, or, if dignified, not\nin an aphetical place, then take the afeendant for giver of life.\nIf the time of birth happens to be by night, the Moon fhall be pre\u00ad\nferred for giver of life, if fhe be pofited in any of the aphetical places of\nNo. 23. 5 U the\nDigitized by Go<. gle Original from\nM n \/ i f VPi Rk ' Dl IQI i r I I D D A D V\n\fp>iRnnfi-nrl-w\n-a\u00ab;n\ni\nm\nc\n;\nn\nn\nil\nh\np\ni\npaaaaaa\n\/\n\/\nt\nI\ntti\ni\n\/\nn\np\n>\n7\nn\nifiin\n-a\niP\nin\nn\nn\n'i\ni\ni\np\ni\ni\ni\nn\nn\nDigiti;\nthe figure.

If\nnone fuch are found in the geniture, the afcendant (hall be taken for\ngiver of life, if a conjundlion preceded ; but, if it was a full Moon, then\nthe part of fortune mud be preferred. If both the luminaries, or feveral\nof the planets which affume the power of fignificator of life by the\nabove-mentioned conditions, are found together in the aphetical places,\nand feem to contend for dominion of prorogation, then that (hall be pre\u00ad\nferred which is found in the mod principal place of the luminaries, whe\u00ad\nther it be the Sun, Moon, or any other planet whatever. The princi\u00ad\npal places of the luminaries are thefe : fird, in the medium cceli; next,\nin the afcendant; then, in the eleventh houfe; next to that, the feventh ;\nand, ladly, the ninth houfe. According to this order, therefore, by the\ngenethliacal figure at the time of birth, (hall the fignificator of life be\nfought out and afcertained.\nOf the ANARETICAL or KILLIN G PLAN ET, and of the\nQUALITY of D EA TH .\nThe anaretic or killing places are the places of Saturn and Mars,\nwhich kill according to the diredion of thehyleg to the fucceeding figns,\nwhen they meet either bodily, or cad their rays from any place of the\nfigure, whether it be by quartile or oppofition ; and fometimes it hap\u00ad\npens by fextiles, when they proceed from figns obedient or beholding,\nbecaufe they have then the fame efficacy with the quartile or oppofition.\nSo likewife a quartile, configurated from the following or fucceeding\nfigns to the aphetic place; and alfo a fextile evilly affeded, when in\nfigns of long afcenfion; and even the trines, in (hort afcenfions, have\nfufficient force to kill, when unimpeded by benefic rays; as will alfo the\nlolar place, if the Moon be hyleg. But it mud be remembered that\nthefe places are only anaretic when they are evilly affeded; for their\nanaretic or killing power is impeded or dedroyed, whenever it falls in the\nterms of a benefic dar, or whenever the benefics cad a fextile, quartile,\ntrine, or oppofitional, ray to the very anaretical point, or to thole points\nwhich follow. Hence life is generally found to bepreferved, when Ju\u00ad\npiter is not above twelve degrees didant from the anareta or killing pla\u00ad\nnet ; or when Venus is not more than eight. The zodiacal afpedts of\nthe anaretic or killing dars will be likewife of little force, whenever the\nlatitude of the apheta, or giver of life, and that of the anareta, or de-\njfirpyer of life, doth not correfpond.\nW hen\nb\nyGoogle Original from\nK I P 1A\/ v n u t ' DI ID I Ir I I R D A D V\n\f\\Vhen the afliftingand anaretic rays are found two or more on each fide,\nwe muft obferve which of them exceed moftin number and power, which\nis to be underftood when the benefics or anaretas are fome of them in\nproper places of the figure, and others n o t; particularly when fome are\noriental, and others occidental, either in refpeCt of the Sun or the figure\nitfelf; for in general no planet under the beams of the Sun hath power\nto kill or fave, unlefs when the Moon is giver of life ; in which cafe the\nplace of the Sun, being affliCted by fome malefic planet joined to it, and\nreceiving no help from benefic rays, will certainly produce death ; but,\nif any benevolent configuration irradiates the place, the native\u2019s life will\nbe preferved.\nTo define the caufe and quality of death, we muft confider whether it\nis likely to happen by means of the beams of the malefic ftars being caft\norientally j for the place of the malefic or anaretical planet, if joined by\nbody, or, if not, the place of the afpeCt, ought carefully to be obferved,\nin order to judge of the quality of death. If thefe deftruCtive beams flow\noccidentally, confider the occidental place of the ftar > for, fuch as they\nare which have dignities in the anaretic place, fuch will be the quality\nof death ; or, if no planet hath dignities therein, then fuch as before others\nare carried by their motions to thefe anaretic places are to be efteemed\nthe caufers of death, and our judgment ftioulft be regulated thereby ; the\nconfigurations of the ftars made thereto being likewife confidered, to\u00ad\ngether with the nature of the figns and the terms in which they fall.\nSaturn, poflefling the dominion of death, caufeth death by chronic\ndiftempers, phthyfics, fluxes, agues, difeafes of the fpleen, dropfies*\niliac and hyfteric diftempers, and, in a word, by all thofe diforders\narifing from abundance of cold. Jupiter produceth death by the quinzey,\ninflammation of the lungs, apoplexy, cramps, and cardiac affeCtions, and\nby thofe diforders which happen with vehement and ftinking breath\u00ad\ning. Mars caufeth death by continual fevers, femi-tertians, fudden ftrokes\nand nephritic affections, fpitting of blood and hemorrhage, by abortion\nand birth, and St. Anthony\u2019s fire, and by all diforders which arife from\nabundance of heat. Venus induceth death by affeCtions of the fto-\nmach and liver, ringworms, and bloody flux; alfo by putrefaction and\nfiftulas, and giving of poifon; and, in a word, by all thofe complaints\nwhich proceed from abundance of moifture, or through want or wafting\nthereof. Mercury deftroys life by madnef's, extafy, and melancholy ;\nfalling ficknefs, coughs, and fpitting aifeCtions, and by thofe which hap \u00ad\npen Amply through much drinefs, or a want thereof. And thefe deaths\nhappen\nOriginal from\nMCIA\/ v n o k ' D I I D I i r I ID Q A R V\n\f4^6 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nhappen naturally, when the rulers of death are in their proper and natu\u00ad\nral quality, and none of the malefics concur.\nViolent and remarkable deaths happen when both the malefics are\nlords of the anaretic places, or when both or one of the two are joined to,\nor fquare, or oppofe, or evilly affedl, both of the luminaries, or the Sun\nalone, or the Moon j for then the mifchievoufnefs and violence of death is\nproduced by the evil affections of the malefics. But the remarkablenefs\nand extraordinary circumftances of the death proceed from the teftimony\nof the lights; and its quality is known from the reft of the afpedting\nliars, and the figns containing the malefics. Saturn therefore inquar-\ntile or oppofition to the Sun, orientally, and in fixed figns, caufeth death\nby fuffocation, tumults of the people, or by hanging or ftranglifig; in\nlike manner he doth the fame if he be occidental, and the Moon follow;\nor, if he be in beaft-like figns or places, he caufeth toperilh by beafts;\nand Venus, being jointed to them, caufeth death by poifon, or by the\ntreachery of women. If he is in Virgo or Pifces, or in moift figns, con\u00ad\nfigurated to the Moon, he will caufe death by water, by being fuffocated\nand drowned; if he be about Argo, by Ihipwreck; if he be in tropical or\nequino&ial figns, the Sun being with him, or oppofing, or if Mars be\nthere, he will caufe death by the effetls of a fall; if they are in the tenth\nhoufe, death will happen by precipitation from on high ; thus Saturn\ncaufes thefe effeCts, being configurated to the luminaries.\nMars in quartile or oppofition to the Sun, and the Sun or Moon ori*\nental, in figns of human form, will caufe death by daughter, either\ncivil or hoftile, or by laying violent hands upon himfelf. If Venus give\nteftimony, death will enfue by means of women; if Mercury be configu\u00ad\nrated to them, death will enfue by robbers, and evil doers, and pirates.\nIf he be in mutilated or imperfedl figns, or with the Gorgon of\nBerleus, he will induce to death by beheading, or by the effect of ampu\u00ad\ntation. Being found in Scorpio or Taurus, he will caufe death by me\u00ad\ndical cutting and burning, or by contractions; but, if he be found in the\nmidheaven, or oppofite to the midheaven, he vill caufe death by hanging;\nparticularly if he be found about Cepbeus and Andromeda. If he be found\nin the weft, or oppofite to the horolcope, he will caufe death by fire ;\nbut, if he be found in fourfooted figns, he will caufe death by falling, or\nby the breaking of limbs. If Jupiter gives teftimony to Mars, and he\nevilly affe&ed, death will happen through the anger of princes, or by\ncondemnation. If the malefics efpecially agree together, and both of\nthem evilly affedt any of the faid places, they make the cruelty of the\ndeath the greater.

The operation is quite eafy j for to bring up the di\u00ad\nredtion of either the Sun or Moon to their proper Textile is no more than\nfinding the content of two third parts of their feuiidiurnal or feminoc-\nturnal arches, according to their pofition either above or below the ho\u00ad\nrizon, and that will be the true arch of diredtion to the fextile.

Solikewife a planet upon thecufp of the ele\u00ad\nventh houfe is in parallel with a planet upon thecufp of the third houfe,\nbeing both equally diftant from the afeendant. Again, a planet, when\nplaced on the cufp of the eleventh houfe, is in parallel to a planet upon\nthe cufp of the fifth houfe, becaufe they are both equally diftant from\nthe tenth and fourth houfes j which rule will hold good with regard to\nthe other houfes.

It is therefore furprifing that fo many inventions (hould\nhave arifen, and fo many errors in confequence adopted, in equating di\u00ad\nrections ; fince it muft be evident to the mod unlettered mind, and a fact\nbeyond the reach of contradiction, that the fame rule which eftimates the\ndays, months, and years, of a man\u2019s life, from the moment of his birth,\nlikewife eftimates the progreflive motion, in days, months, and years, of\nevery luminary within our cognizance, in the vaft extent of fpace] This\nrule is nothing more than the Sun\u2019s apparent progrefs through every de\u00ad\ngree and minute of the ecliptic, meafured by the degrees of the equator;\nto which unerring ftandard every matter that refers to any defcription or\nportion of time muft be ultimately brought, or all our labour, and all\nour accuracy, will prove abortive and premature.\nAccording to the common adage, \u201c when the difeafe is known, the cure\nis half performed;\u201d and fo we may fay of the meafure of directions; for,\nwhen the ftandard is known, the procefs is eafily accomplifhed, as follows.\nWhen the true arch of direction is found, by any of the foregoing rules,\nand is to be equated, take the right afcenfion of the Sun\u2019s place at the time\nDigitizedby Goi ole MEM1 V A D Y I Ir I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 4%\nS\nof birth, and add the arch of direction to the Sun\u2019s right afcenfion ; with\nthis fum enter the tables of the right afcenfion, and find what degree and\nminute of the ecliptic anfwers thereto; then take the Ephemeris for the\nyear of birth, and note how many days and hours the Sun will be, from\nthe time of birth, in coming to that degree and minute of the ecliptic;\nand for every perfect day, which is twenty-four hours, account a year,\nand for every two hours over and above the even days, a month, and fo\nin the fame proportion for minutes and feconds of time, and the arch of\ndirection will be truly equated; as will be {hewn by repeated examples,\nin equating the directions of the following nativities.\nI flatter myfelf that the rules given in this fyftem of directions, if\ncarefully attended to, will be amply fufticient to familiarize any of my\nreaders in this important branch of the occult fciences, without the aid of\nwhich, little or nothing can be done in the calculation of nativities.\nFor though it be admitted, that a ftudent may make great advances in\nthe knowledge of futurity, by acquiring an adequate, comprehenfion of\nthe nature and effects of the various configurations and familiarities of the\nceleftial bodies, and of their particular influence both benefic and ma\u00ad\nlefic upon the human race; and though we may by this means attain to\nknow that l'uch and fuch events will certainly come to pafs; yet even\nthis acquifition in the fcience muft be confidered incomplete, without\nthe ability of pointing out, by fome fixed and certain rule, the precife\ntime when thefie events lhall happen. This is not to be attained by the\nmethods ufed in the vulgar Aftrology, as already laid down in the former\npart of this work, where the common Aftrology is treated of, but with\ngreat rifle and uncertainty, and was therefore only introduced for the pur-\npofe of anfwering horary queftions, where correctnefs, in this particular,\nis little attended to by any modern profeflbrs.\nThis grand acquifition is therefore not to be obtained by any other\nmode, than that of bringing up the arch of direction of each refpective\nfignificator in the native\u2019s figure of birth, to the afpect which denotes\neach refpective event; and this arch of direction, as I have before ob-\nferved, is nothing more than the track or circle in the heavens formed\nby the fignificator in moving from that particular point in the heavens\nwhere he is found at the birth; fo the precife point where he forms the\nafpect with the promittor that indicates the event, which, upon his ar\u00ad\nrival there, is to happen. It is confequently apparent, that if this track\nor circle can be found, and its content in degrees and minutes accurately\ntaken, and reduced into common time according to the motion of the\nSun, which regulates all our accounts of time, it will fhew us at one\nview.\nDigitized by Google Original from\nMH\/ ll v n o k ' DIIQI i r I I D D A D V\n\fu\nu\ni\ni\ni\nd\ni\ni\ni\n,\nu\nu\nu\ny\ni\ne\n-\nu\ni\ny\nl\nu\nz\ne\nu\n\/\ni\nn\ni\n|\nj\n;\n\/\n\/\nw\nw\nv\nv\n.\ni\ni\nd\nu\nn\nu\nubL.ui\ny\n\/d\nt.\nt.\nt:\nb\nb\n_\nu\nb\nt:\n-\nw\n-\np\nu\n-\ny\nu\nu\ny\nie\n486 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nview, the exact time when the event, according to the common courfe of\nnature, (hall infallibly come to pafs.\nIn this procefs confifts the whole myftery of afcertaining the period of\nman\u2019s life, which is thought fo wonderful a matter by fome, and confi-\ndercd altogether impoffible by others ; and yet it is no more than a fimple\noperation of nature, deduced from an intimate knowledge with fecond\ncaufes. For this is a rule that will never be found to fail, if our arith\u00ad\nmetic be true, that at the very time the principal fignificator in a nativity,\nthat is, the giver of life, (hall arrive at the anaretical point of the afpect\nof the killing planet, the native (hall furely depart this life provided\nno benefic rays at the fame time irradiate the place, or in any afpect con\u00ad\ncur to impede the killing force, which may always be known from the\ndifpofition of the benefic planets in the nativity. If this affertion be\ntrue, which has been proved by innumerable examples in all ages of the\nworld, and which I truft will be confirmed by the nativities following,\nit is evident that we can, by the foregoing rules, bring up the directions\nwith fufficient accuracy to afccrtain the precife length of time in years,\nmonths, and days, in which the fignificator of life will be in moving to\nthe anaretical or killing point; and juft fo long will be the life of that\nnative. Where then is the myftery or impoffibility of afcertaining the\nperiod of human life, and with extraordinary precifion? But this accu\u00ad\nracy wholly depends upon the true time of birth being obtained ; for a\nfailure here in the radical point will deftroy the whole calculation, and\nnothing predicted therefrom can poffibly happen but by the effect of\nchance.\nBut it is here neceffary to remark, that in fuch nativities as are vital,\nand afford fufficient teftimonies of a ftrong and healthful conftitution,\none diredtion alone is feldom found to kill : for in fuch nativities there\nis required a train of malevolent directions to concur to death j and the\ninterpofition of one fingle direction of the benefics, even if it be a quar-\ntile or oppofition, irradiating the very anaretical point, will moft times\npreferve life. But where feveral malevolent directions of the malefic\nftars concur together, without the aid or interference of the benevolent\nplanets, they never fail to deftroy life. And here it mu ft be obferved,\nthat in fuch trains of directions we are to diftinguifli between the killing\nplanet and that which is the caufer of the quality of death ; for one pla\u00ad\nnet doth not (hew both. The foremoft of the malefic train is the killing\nplace, and (hews the time of death; but the following directions, though\nbenevolent, (hew the quality of it.

But fecondary directions are by no\nmeans of fuch an extenfive confideration j nor of any great utility in the\nfcience, that I have as yet been able to difeover, particularly if accuracy\nand truth are to be preferred in thefe fpeculations. For, by the ufe of\nthe primary directions in the calculation of nativities, we are not only\nenabled to judge of the quality and influence of the afpeCts, but can\nlikewife trace them to the precife time of their operation; whereas the\nfecondary directions at belt only afford the artift matter for fuperficial en\u00ad\nquiry and vague conjeCture. I lhall neverthelefs explain the nature and\nufe of them in this place, fince it is the plan of this work to comprehend\nevery praCtice hitherto introduced into the feiened of aftrology, with a\nview to enable the reader to diftinguiih the ufeful and rational from the\ninutile and redundant part of it.\nBy fecondary directions, then, we are to underftand thofe configurations\nand familiarities of the planets which arife daily from the time of birth,\nand are applied to the prediction of events that are to come to pafsin the\nfame fuccefiion of years from the birth as correfpond with thofe days. For\nexample, allafpects of the ftars, both to the luminariesandcardinal houles,\nthat happen on the firftday after birth, are applied to the firft year ; thofe\nof the fecond day after birth to the fecond year ; thofe of the third day\nto the third year'; thofe of the fourth day to the fourth year; and fo on,\nin progreflive rotation, as far as this fpeculation can extend.\nIn the management of thefe directions, we are principally toobferve what\nconfigurations the Moon has to the other planets ; for, if fhe be joined\nwith benefic ftars, or irradiated by their good afpects, or even by the\nNo. 24. 6 C good\nDigitized by Got gle Original from\nM P l \/ l l v n c i c D I I D I 1r 1 I P P A P V\n\f488 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\ngood afpe&s of the infortunes, it denotes a happy, healthful, and prof-\nperous, year to the native, in nature and quality peculiar to the principal\nfignificator in each configuration, and to the houfes and figns in which\nthey fall in the radical figure. But on the contrary, if the Moon be\njoined to malevolent ftars, or irradiated by them, or in parallel declina\u00ad\ntion of the infortunes, it forebodes, to thofe years pointed out by the\ndays in which thefe evil configurations happen, great affli6lions either\nin mind, body, or eftate; and, if a primary direction (houid correfpond.\nwith them, of the fame malignant nature, a complication of temporal\nmisfortunes will moil probably enfue.\nIn the confideration of thefe directions, we are particularly to attend\nto the critical days and climadterical years ; for at thofe times the good\nor evil configurations of the planets are moil powerful in their opera\u00ad\ntion. If upon either of thofe occafions the^Moon be found in quartile\noroppofition to the place in which flie was pofited at the time of birth,\nand an evil primary direction of the fignificator of life correfpond there\u00ad\nwith, death is then at the door, or at that time very much to be appre\u00ad\nhended, even in the ftrongeft conftitutions. And fo likewife, if the Sun\nor Moon in the fecondary directions are afflicted by the malignant rays of\ninaufpicious configurations with an evil primary direction, with which\nboth the revolution and tranfit agree, it is confidered an irrevocable indi\u00ad\ncation of death to the native.\nThefe fecondary directions, I underftand, have always been in reputa\u00ad\ntion among the Arabs and Egyptians, who, in common practice, prefer\nthis method of predicting from the.genethliacal figure to the more com\u00ad\nplicated and laborious mode of calculation by the primary directions.\nThe former practice has doubtlefs the advantage in point of expedition;\nfor by the ufeof it in thofe countries, they will, upon the bare infpect-\ntion of a nativity, give an account of the general and particular incidents\nduring the whole courfe of the native\u2019s life ; and yet, by repeated trials\nof it myfelf, I have found it in many inftances erroneous, and therefore\nnot to be adopted in theferious inveftigation of nativities, where accuracy\nand truth are to be defired. It it is a doctrine much on a level with that\nof horary queftions, and may be ufed to give a general idea of the native\u2019s\nfigure of birth, and of his probable bent of fortune, where time or cir-\ncumftances will not admit of particular calculations.\nBut, upon delivering judgement upon either fpecies of directions, whe\u00ad\nther prinary or fecondary, it is abfolutely neceflary to pay the greatelfc\nattention to the nature and quality of the afpects we direct to, as well\nthofe\nOriginal from\nM\nC\n\\A\n\/ D\nIID\nI Ir IIDDADV\nDigitized by Goi. gle\n\fu\nu\ni\ni\ni\nd\ni\nu\n,\nu\nu\nu\ny\ni\ne\n-\nu\ni\ny\ni\nu\nz\ni\ne\nu\n\/\ni\niL\nip\n;\/\/v\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\n.iid\nL\ni\nn\nu\nu\nb\ni\n.\nu\ni\ny\n\/\nd\nu\n.\nt\n;\nb\nb\n_\nu\nb\ne\n#\np\nu\n-\ny\nu\nu\ny\ni\nt\n;\nO F A S T R O L O G Y . 489\nthofe in the world as thofe in the zodiac: for it often happens that a\nzodiacal afpeCt may import much good, when at the fame point of time\na malignant mundane configuration may come up, of fo ftrong and pow\u00ad\nerful a nature as to fruftrateall the beneficial effeCls portended by the\nformer. The want of attending to, or knowing, this, has frequently\nconfounded our modern pra&itioners j who, confiding in the benignant\ntendency of fome extraordinary good afpefts in the zodiac, have promifed\nan advance of fortune to the native, which has never come to pafs, becaufe\ncounter-afpe&s in the world, which have the ftrongeft and neareft rela\u00ad\ntion to fublunary things, have confpired, at the fame inftant of time, to\nfuperfede the beneficial effeCls of the zodiacal configurations; and which\nwould perhaps have been felt in an extraordinary degree of malignity,\nwere it not that the above-mentioned falutary aipeCts were oppofed to\nthem* \/ S y .\nHence it mull appear to every rational mind, that the ftri&eft caution\nand the utmoll deliberation are neceflary, in forming our opinion upon the\ndire&ions of a nativity ; for, if atlaft we err in this, all our labour is loft,\nand the unfortunate enquirer is deluded with vain expectations of a happy\nrun of great good fortune, or terrified with the approach of fome dread\u00ad\nful cataftrophe, neither of which, by the nature of the ftars, was ever\nintended to happen. That this want ofjudgement has of late years been\ntoo commonly praclifed upon the public, cannot be denied, nor too fe-\nverely reprobated. But Hill, let not the relentlefs unbeliever of Aftro-\nlogy raife his exalted creft too high on this occafionj nor infill, becaufe\nthcfe errors have been common, that the fcience of prediction has no ex-\niftence in truth and nature; his unbelief mull clearly aril\u2019\ne from a want\nof inclination to contemplate the curious efteCls of fecond caufes.\nBrute creatures may perhaps enjoy the faculty of beholding vifible\nthings with a more penetrating eye than ourfelves j but Tpiritual objects\nare as far out of their reach as though they had no being. Neareft,\ntherefore, to the brute creation, are thofe men, who fuffer themfelves to\nbe fo far governed by external objects, as to believe nothing but what\nthey fee, and feel, and can accommodate to their own lhallow imagina\u00ad\ntions. Let fuch men doubt whether they have a foul in their body, be\u00ad\ncaufe their eyes never faw it i or that there are ftars in the firmament at\nnoon-day, becaufe the appear not; or that it is not air in which they\nbreathe, becaufe nothing appears to them but an infenfible vacuity.\nSurely all that know they poflefs a foul mull of necefiiry believe the\nrule and government of angels, which they fee not j and,.if from no\nother grounds, they muft, I think, from that apparent analogy which\nthey\nDigitized by Gooale Original from\nM P W i \/ V f l D ^ Dl I P I I r I I D D A D V\n\f490 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nthey cannot but perceive between the greater and the lefs world j for,\nas the little world man confifts of an outward vifible body, and an in\u00ad\nward fpiritual foul, which gives life and motion to the organical frame,\nfo pofieding all parts as to be wholly in all, and in each didinft part\nwholly ; fo mud it be alfo in the great univerfe, the fenfible and mate\u00ad\nrial part whereof .hath being and motion from thofe fpiritual powers\nwhich dwell in, and wholly fill and aduate, i t : therefore the Adrologian\nregards nature with the eyes of St. Paul, 2 Cor. iv. 18. he looks not a t\nthe things which are feen , but a t the things w hich are notfeen : f o r the\nthings which are feen are tem poral, but the things w hich are not Jeen are\neternal.\nHaving now completely laid down the rudiments of the Science of\n.Aftrojogy, in as comprel\\jnfive, plain, aqd intelligent, a manner as pof*\nfible, I (hall immediately proceed to teach <the application thereof, in\ncalculating the following nativities. It is my wi(h to perform this talk\nin fuch a manner as to enable the mod fuperficial reader to accompany\nme through every minute procefs in the bulinefs, and to follow me in\nbringing up every diredion to their proper afpects, as they (hall refpec-\ntively occur in the genethliacal figures. If I can do this, I have no\ndoubt of foon convincing the mod obftinate unbeliever of the fcience,\nthat it has both utility and truth on its fide j and that the beings of rea-\nfon, who bear the image of their beneficent Creator, are not wholly left\nwithout the help of forefight and foreknowledge, in a very ample and\nextraordinary degree, if they will but adopt the necelTary means of ac\u00ad\nquiring it.\nThe nativities that follow fall immediately under my own obfervation\nand knowledge, and I have chofen them in preference to any that have\nbeen before publilhed, or to thofe of perfons not now living, becaufe I\nwould avoid putting it in the power of any perfon to fay, that our calcu\u00ad\nlations are at all founded upon enquiries into the people\u2019s way of life, of\ntheir good or ill fortune, of their ficknefs or health, of the particular\nincidents of their life pad, or of the external caufes of their death ; for,\nif the rules that I have laid down will not enable us to accomplifh all\nthis from the fituation of the planets in the figure of birth, our fcience\nis indeed a mere delufion, and its followers nothing better than jugglers\nand impodors.\nBut, to make this enquiry eafy to my readers, and to fave them as much\nas poftible the trouble of long and tedious calculations, I (hall in this\nplace introduce a fet of tables, which are fo contrived as to refolve every\nquedion\nOriginal from\nMP1M V n D t ' D I I D I i r I I D D A D V\ndby G o o g l e\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 4 9 i\n\u2022 queftion that will arife in the management of nativities or horary quef-\ntions; as well in refped to the places and pofitions of the planets and\ntheir afpeds, as to the bringing up their proper diredions. I fhall\nlikewife add a fhort explanation of each diftind fet of Tables, and\nreduce them to pradice, in calculating the following nativities, in fuch\na manner as to make their ufe eafy and familiar; hoping by this means\nto remove, if poffible, that fudden impreffion of difficulty and embar-\nraffment, which is felt by mod readers on the firft view of mathematical\nTables. I am perfuaded no difficulty whatever will attend the acqui-\nfition of a competent knowledge of thefe, if a proper attention be paid\nto them ; without which, little progrefs can be expeded. The moft\naccompliffied artift of us all could never yet beftow the gift of infpira-\ntio n ; and therefore, without fuitable endeavours, let none attempt the\nintricate paths of fcience.\nThe Tables I ((hall introduce in this place, are thofe for finding the\nfemidiurual and feminodurnal Arches ; Tables of T w ilight; of M un\u00ad\ndane Afpeds ; of Right and Oblique Afcenfions ; of Declination, and\nAfcenfional Differences ; with fome others, calculated to make the ufe of\nthe above more comprehenfive and univerfal.\nO f the T A B L E S of S E M I D I U R N A L and S E M I \u00ad\nN O C T U R N A L A R C H E S .\nAfter what has been premifed in the foregoing Treatife on Diredions,\nthe neceffity of readily finding the femidiurnal and feminodurnal Arches\nmull become obvious. I have therefore calculated a Table of them to\nevery degree of the Ecliptic for the latitude of London* which, being\nmoft wanted, will of courfe fave the practitioner fome trouble. Under\nthe different latitudes in the other Tables, are fpecified the femidiurnal\narches of all the northern figns, proper to thofe latitudes; as Aries,\nTaurus, and Gemini, at the top of the Table ; and Cancer, Leo, and\nVirgo, at the bottom of the Table. But, to find the feminodurnal\narches proper thereto, it only requires to fubtrad the femidiurnal arch\nfrom twelve hours, and the remainder will be the feminodurnal arch\nfought. So likewife the feminodurnal arches for all the l'outhern figns\nare placed under the different latitudes in the Tables, having Libra,\nScorpio, and Sagittarius, at the top of the colum ns; and Capricorn,\nAquaries, and Piles, at the bottom ; and, to obtain the femidiurnal arches\ncorrefponding with them, add the amount of the feminodurnal arch to\ntwelve hours, and the fum will be the femidiurnal arch required; many\nexamples of which will be fhewn hereafter.\nNo. 25. 6 D But,\nOriginal from\nMEUkf v n c f c ' Dl I P l i r I I D P\nDigitized by Go*, gle\n\f492 AN I L L U S T R A T I O N\nBut, (hould the fcmidiurnal or femino&urnal arches be required for\nany latitude not fpecified in the Tables, they may be found th u s: Firft,\nfind the declination of the planet under the pole of birth ; and, if the\ndeclination falls in any of the fix northern figns, add the difference of\nAfcenfion to ninety degrees, and the fum will be the femidiurnal arch, in\ndegrees and minutes ; if the afcenfional difference be fubtraded from\nninety degrees, the remainder will be the femidiurnal arch. But, if the\ndeclination fhould fall in either of the fix fouthern figns, then fubtrad\nthe difference of afcenfion from ninety degrees, for the femidiurnal arch ;\nand add the afcenfional difference to ninety degrees, for the femino6tur-\nnal arch. If the arches thus found are divided by fix, they will give\nthe horary times, or true length of the planetary hours; and, if divided\nby three, they will give the true diftance of one houfe, by which method\nthe true divifion of all the houfes may be obtained, according to the\nrules of Ptolomy j two of which parts make a Textile, as appears more\nobvioufly by the Table of Mundane Afpetts, wherein are fpecified all the\nafpedts that are made in the world.\nO f the T A B L E S of T W I L I G H T .\nThe ufe of thefe Tables, in bringing up the arches of dirediions, hath\nbeen already mentioned ; it will therefore be fufficient in this place to\ninform the reader how to make ufe of them. The firft column on the\nleft hand contains the parallels of Twilight ; and the body of the Tables\n(hews the diftance the Sun muft be from the eaftern or weftern angles, that\nis, from the afeendant or feventh houfe, to be in thofe parallels; therefore,\nwhenever thefe Tables are ufed for any calculations, the following me\u00ad\nthod muft be adopted : Take the oblique afcenfion of the afeendant\nunder the pole of birth, from whence fubtradl the oblique afcenfion of\nthe Sun, and the remainder will be its primary diftance, which is to be\nfought in the Tables as near as poflible to that degree which the Sun is\nin; which being found, look in the column of Parallels of Twilight,\nand fee what parallel correfponds with it, for under that parallel the\narch of Twilight muft be taken; examples of which will hereafter be\nfrequently given.\nOf the TABLES of MUNDANE ASPECTS.\nThe firft column of thefe Tables contains the femidiurnal and femi-\nnodturnal arches, from three to nine hours, calculated to every fix mi\u00ad\nnutes. In the next column, and oppofite to thefe arches, in a diredl\nline, is the fpace of the houfe that the femidiurnal or feminodturnal\narches\nDigitized by Go\u00bb.'file Original from\nM C U\/ Dl IB I Ir I I B B A B V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 493\narches refpe&ively give; and in the fucceeding columns are arranged all\nthe mundane afpects anfwering thereto, truly calculated to the very de\u00ad\ngree and minute, which are fometimes twice as much as at others; and\nthe reafon is, becaufe the femidiurnal and feminodturnal arches vary in\ntheir content to full that amount.\nOf the T A B L E S of R I G H T A S C E N S I O N S .\nTo find the right afcenfion of a ftar, the longitude muft be given,\nwith which enter the left hand column of the table; and under the'fign\nand latitude at the top of the columns, in the angle of meeting, is the\nright afcenfion required. For example : Suppofe a planet to be pofited in\nten degrees of Aries, and to have two degrees north latitude ; enter the\ntables of right afcenfion with ten degrees of Aries, in the left-hand\ncolumn, and in the angle of meeting, under two degrees of north lati\u00ad\ntude, will befound the right afcenfion thereof, viz. eight degrees twenty-\nthree minutes.\nOf the T A B L E S of D E C L I N A T I O N .\nTo find the declination of a planet, the longitude muft be given, with\nwhich enter the table of declinations on the left hand ; and in the column\nof longitude, againft the degree of longitude, is the declination fought. If\nthe ftar hath latitude, either north or fouth, enter the tables under the\nlatitude, as the titles dire<ft, always remembering that, if the ftar be in\nCancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, or Sagittarius, the degrees of longi\u00ad\ntude to the left hand, beginning at the top of the tables, are to be\ntaken ; but, if the ftar be in Capricorn, Aquaries, Pifces, Aries, Taurus,\nor Cancer, then the degrees of longitude to the right hand, beginning\nat the foot of the table, muft be retorted to. Example : Suppofe a ftar\nin ten degrees of Virgo, with one degree twenty-feven minutes north\nlatitude; I enter the table of declinations, finding Virgo in the head\nof the table; and againft ten degrees under one degree of latitude I\nfind eight degrees forty-feven minutes, and againft ten degrees under\ntwo degrees of latitude I find nine degrees forty-two-minutes ; the dif\u00ad\nference is fifty-five minutes. Then, for the part proportional agreeing to\nthe odd minutes of latitude, I fay. If fixty give fifty-five, what fball\ntwenty-feven give ? It gives twenty-five; which, added to eight degrees\nforty-feven minutes, leaves the declination of the point fought, nine de\u00ad\ngrees twelve minutes.

Enter with the degrees of declination on the left\nhand of the Table, and under the circle of pofition in the head, in the\ncommon angle of meeting, with equation, will be found the afcenlional\ndifference required. Example : Suppofe a planet to have ten degrees of\ndeclination, and his circle of pofition be fifty-one degrees forty-two mi\u00ad\nnutes ; I enter with ten degrees on the left hand under the circle of fifty-\none degrees, and there I find twelve degrees thirty-five minutes ; but,\nhaving forty-two minutes more, I take the part proportional between\nfifty-one degrees and fifty-two degrees, viz.\nDeclination ten degrees latitude\nDifference\ndeg. deg. min\n5 1 12 35\n52 13 3\nO 28\nThen I fay, by the rule of proportion, If fixty give twenty-eight, what\nlhall forty-two, the odd minutes of the circle of pofition, give ?

Secondly, when the declina\u00ad\ntion is fouth, add the afcenfional difference to the right afcenfion, and the\nfum will be the oblique afcenfion; but, if you fubtraft it from the right\nafcenfion, the remainder will be the oblique defcenfion.

remain\u00ad\nder would have been the oblique defcenfion.\u2014The fame rules will apply\nto the calculating or finding the oblique defcenfion of all the planets, in\nevery degree of latitude.\nI fhall now fubjoin Tables of Logiftical Logarithms, for the purpofe\nof finding the part proportional, either in time or motion, between any\ntwo planets or fignihcators ; which will entirely complete this fet of\nAftrological Tables, and render them an eafy and familiar guide to every\nfludent, in afcertaining the dire<ftions of all the planets, whether mun\u00ad\ndane or zodiacal, direct or converfe, that can poffibly occur in the cal\u00ad\nculation of nativities, or horary queftions.\nTo make the ufe of them more obvious to the underftanding of every\nreader, I fhall fubjoin a variety of examples, (hewing how to afcertain\nthe daily and hourly motion of any given planet; and alfo to determine\nthe precife time when any two fignificators will meet in one and the fame\npoint of the heavens, or form any other afped upon the horofcope or gc-\nniture of any enquirer, in the courfe of pradice.\nThe expedition with which Nativities may be calculated, or Aftrolo\u00ad\ngical Queries anfwered, by the aid of this fet of tables, not to mention\nthe expedition with which the governing configurations are found, will\namply reward the reader for any time or trouble beftowed in acquiring a\ncompetent knowledge of them ; as will abundantly appear by the method\nin which I fhall bring up the diredions of the fubjoined nativity of my\nlearned friend Mr. Witchell, Mafter of the Portfmouth Royal Academy.\nIt may alfo be premifed, that the ftudent, well informed in all the fore\u00ad\ngoing rudiments of the fcience; in the nature and tendency of the pla\u00ad\nnets, and their various configurations ; will, with pleafing aptitude, by\nthe ufe of thefe tables, find himfelf qualified for the calculation of his\nown or any other nativity, precifely in the fame way as will be laid down\nin the management of that above-mentioned, which will prove a compe\u00ad\ntent example for all others.\nThefe tables of Logiftical Logarithms are of a triple or three-fold ex\u00ad\ntent; the firft column appertains to motion, the fecond toabfolute num\u00ad\nbers, and the third to a correct meafure of time, as fpecified at the top\nof each table refpedively.\nI have thought it moft confident to let the tables precede, and the ex\u00ad\nplanatory examples follow; for it is impofiible to imprels the mind with\nNo. 30. 7 F a proper\nDigitized by Google Original from\nM P \/ i \/ v

appear by what oc\u00ad\ncurs hereafter.\nIt is not abfolutely neceffary that the reader Ihould ftudy the art of con-\nftrudting logarithms to underftand the ufeof the following tables, which\nare here inferted for the mere purpofe of references, agreeable to the fcve-\nral Examples that follow j it is fufficient for the reader to know, that ad\u00ad\ndition of logarithms is the fame thing as multiplication in common arith\u00ad\nmetic, and fubtradlion in logarithms the fame as divifion j therefore in\nmultiplication by logarithms, add the logarithms of the multiplicand and\nmultiplier together, and their fum is the logarithm of the produdl; and\nin divifion, fubtraft the logarithm of the divifor from the logaritham of\nthe dividend, and the remainder is the logarithm of the quotient. To\nextradl the roots of powers by logarithms, divide the logarithm of the\nnumber by the index of the power, and the quotient is the logarithm of\nthe root fought; to raife a number to any power, multiply the logarithm\nof the number by the index of that power, and the product is the loga\u00ad\nrithm of the power to which the number was required to be raifed.\nTABLES\nOriginal from\nM\niriA\nf vrtrs i\ns m i n i ir* i i n n r\n\\n\\y\nDigitized by Gougle\n\fT A B L E S\nO F\nL O G I S T I C A L LOGARITHMS,'\nFor finding the Part proportional both to\nT I M E and M O T I O N ,\nDigitized by Google Original from\nv n o k ' di id i ir i i q r a d v\n\fDigitized by Google Original from\nM C I A \/ V r i R ^ Dl I P I I r I I D D A D V\n\fO F A S T R O L O G Y . 595\nL O G I S T I C A L L O O A K 1 TH M b.\nMinute.

The Moon mee\u00bbs all rays in the circle of latitude in which Ihe\nconftantly moves, and that is always out of the ecliptic, except when\nthe is in her nodes j and therefore, when fhe is diredted, as a fignificator\nwith latitude, to a promittor in the zodiac, the latitude of the Moon\u2019s\nplace mud be found. Under this latitude, the declination mud be fought,\nwhich (hews the oblique afcenfion or defcenfion under the pole of the\nM oon; and hence the arch of diredlion is corredlly found, by fubtradl-\ning the oblique afcenfion or defcenfion of the Moon under her pole, not\nforgetting that this oblique afcenfion or defcenfion mud be taken ac\u00ad\ncording to the latitude of her place at the hour of birth. This is called\na zodiacal diredlion with latitude; but, when tlie Moon is diredted to an\nafpedt without latitude, the place of the zodiac where the afpedt falls\nis to be taken without latitude, both in right afcenfion and declination;\nand thus find the oblique defcenfion or afcenfion of the point under the\npole of the Moon; from which fubtradl the oblique afcenfion or defcenfion\nof the Moon, taken according to the latitude file had at the time of birth,\nand the arch of diredlion is found, which is to be converted into years as\nbefore.\nXI. Diredlions are of two forts, zodiacal and mundane. The Sun and\nMoon arc capable of being diredted both ways; but the angles of a figure\ncan only be diredled in mundo, they being fubjedt to the accidents and\ndivifion of no circles, but thofe which conftitute the meafure of each\nquadrant, and are meafured by the parts of the diurnal and feminocturnal\narches; therefore they never meet any rays with latitude but bodies and\noppofitions.\nXII. The mid-heaven and afcendant are two different * circles. The\nmid-heaven meets all rays, and meafures all afpedts by the zodiac; but the\nafcendant, by the rapt motion or horary circle; by which motion the di\u00ad\nurnal circle is alfo meafured, the houfes of heaven divided, and the mun\u00ad\ndane afpedts proportiOnably meafured.\n* T h e zodiacal circle m eafures thirty-fix m inutes to an hour, but the rapt m otion, or horary cir\u00ad\ncle, is fom euines m ore or lels, according to the length of the fem idiurnal arch or planetary hour.\n2 The\nOriginal from\nM H A \/ V O D \/ Dl I P I I r I I P D A D V\nDigitized by Got.>ale\n\f6i8 A N I L L U S T R A T I O N\nThe knowledge of equating the planet\u2019s places for different meridians be\u00ad\ning abfolutely neceffarj for calculating the nativities of rhofe perions who\nwere born under the meridian of London, for which latitude the Ephe-\nmerifes are generally calculated; I fhall now teach how to calculate ei\u00ad\nther the mundane or zodiacal directions for any other latitude, and how\na planet in one meridian may be reduced to that of another, with the ut-\nmoft degeee of corredtnefs and precifxon.\nFor example, fuppofeit were required to know the difference between\nthe meridians of London and Briftol; refer to page 179 of this work, and\non the t i t h o f June, at twelve o\u2019clock at noon, the Moon is in five\ndegrees forty-fix minutes of Aries, under the meridian of London ;\nbut, to reduce it to the meridian of Briftol, purfue the following method.\nSee by the table, page 208, the longitude of London, and it will be\nfound - - - - - - 23 26\nSubtract the longitude of Briftol, which is - M9 41\nAnd there remains - - - - 3 45\nW ith this difference, three degrees forty-five minutes, look into the table\nfor turning the degrees of the equator into time, in page 206; then refer\nto table the fecond, by which it will be found, that one degree gives four\nminutes ; and confequently, three degrees forty-five minutes, the dif\u00ad\nference of the two longitudes, muft give fifteen minutes difference of\ntime in two meridians; and, as Briftol is fituate weft from London, the\nMoon muft be in five degrees forty-fix minutes of Aries, fifteen minutes\nbefore noon at Briftol, and at noon, viz. at twelve o\u2019clock according to\nher own motion in an hour, gives for that time, going at the rate of\nthirty-three minutes forty-feven feconds the quarter of an hour, eight\nminutes twenty-feven fcconds, which, being added to five degrees forty-\nfix minutes, make five degrees fifty-four minutes and twenty-feven le-\nconds of the Moon in Aries, at twelve o\u2019clock at Briftol. And here note,\nthat, if the place were fituate eaft from London, then the difference of time\nmuft have been fubtraCted from the meridian of London, which would\nin the fame manner have fhewn the difference of the meridians.\nEND of the FIRST VOLUME.\nOriginal from\nMClAf v n D V m IPI Ir I I D D A D V\nDigitized by G\not*ale\n\f\u00bb9 A s t r o l o g y . \u2014 S ib le y 's (E ) C o m p le te Illu s tra tio n of th e\nA stro lo g ic a l a n d O c c u lt S c ie n c e s; c o m p re h e n d in g th e\na r t o f fo re te llin g fu tu re e v e n ts b y th e H e a v e n ly b o d ie s.\nW ith numerous curious copper-plates, an d N a tiv itie s an d\nin c a n ta tio n s ; p o r tr a it. 2 v o ls. 4 to ,'h a lf calf.
