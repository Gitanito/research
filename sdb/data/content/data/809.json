Publisher: Roger Brothers, publishers and proprietors.  Editor: John R. Meader.\r\n Corporate author:  Official Organ of the Great American Federation of Sane and Sincere Thinkers\r\n1\/1, October 1908.  64 pp., $1.50 a year.\n\nThis was a journal that expired (according to the Library of Congress note) after the first issue -- before it could quite decide what it was about, though it announced itself as an independent exponent of \"advanced thought, demonstrable truths in religion, science, and philosophy, and all social and political reforms that are tending to facilitate the progress of the world.\"  The \"publisher and proprietor\" was a small publishing house in Greenwich Village that had put out a few New Thought works (notably by Thomas Troward), and hired John Richard Meader as editor, despite the fact that he was already editing the Bohemian at the time.  He had some interest in New thought (he wrote The Ten Laws of Success (1910) and, with Hereward Carrington, Death: Its Causes and Phenomena (1912)).  He contributed to this journal but he failed to have a clear vision of the journal's purpose.  It carried articles on \"Telepathy,\" \"Personality,\" \"The Masters and Mastery of Life,\" Some Sayings of Baha,\" \"Andrew McConnell's Theories and Discoveries in Human Electricity,\" \"The Universal Spirit of True Religion,\" etc., and contributions by Swami Paramananda, Charles Brodie Patterson, Lida A. Churchill, Hereward Carrington, Muhammed Baraka-tullah, Jane Brownlee, and others, together with filler excerpts from Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Heinrich Heine.  It was a grab bag.  Most notable in the journal was an advertisement for and review of \"Luo Clement's\" Ancient Science of Numbers (1908), published by Roger Brothers, which is interesting because of the vast online discussion of Clement's identity.  The most compelling answer seems to be that he was the mysterious stock picker and market-cycle prognosticator William Delbert Gann (1878-1955), who self-published The Tunnel Thru the Air in 1927 that, it averred, contained a \"valuable secret, clothed in mysterious language.\"   The journal also advertised Luo Clement's \"Lessons in Character Reading by Name and Birth\" that appeared in The Pictorial Review.
