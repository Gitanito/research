Bourru and Burot, two doct.ors of the School of\nNaval Medicinp at Rochefort, dealing with the action of drugs at 3\ndistance. 1,: IIottracted considerable attention, aml M. Burot has very\nkindly suppiied us with some corrections and explanations of the\nDigitized by Google\n\f~,l885.] Journal of Society .fOl' P8ycMcai Re8eal\u00b7cll. 6ft\nreports of it which appeared in La Semaine Medicale, of August 19th,\nand Le Ten,p8, of August 22nd. It relates some novel experiences,\nwhich may be found to touch several new points in the possibilities of\nthought-transference lionel nervous susceptibility; and, as it might not\n-otherwise fall under the notice of our readers, a. short re,un&e of the\nprincipal points will perhaps not be out of place here.\nCareful observations ha.ve been made during the last six months in\nthe Hospital at Rochefort on two patients. The first was a man, aged 22,\n'Who had led a somewhat anoma.lous and vagrant life. When he was a\nyears old he had attacks that appeared to be hysterical, and were fol-\nlowed by paralysis of both legs that lasted for a. year, and disappeared\nsuddenly after a long hysterical crisis. During his para.lysis he was in\na hospital at Bonneval, and learnt the trade of a tailor, but on his\nsudden recovery there was some change in his personality j he did not\nrecognise his surroundings, and did not remember his tailor's art. He\npassed through various hospitals, but finally enlisted in the Marines,\nand was taken in at the Rochefort Hospital in March, 1885. The\nother patient was a woman, aged 26, who had been among the\nhystero-epileptic cases in the SalpAtriere Hospital in Paris, under M.\nCharcot, when she was 18, for about a. year and a-half, a.nd had sho'vn\nmany subsequent hysterical symptons before she came under observa-\ntion at Rochefort in the spring of 1885. The ma.n had lost sensation\non the right side of his body, and in treating this the effects of various\nmeWs in contact with the skin were first tlied. Zinc, copper, platinum,\nand iron had some slight effects j gold a.nd mercury acted much more\nviolently j indeed, gold, when it was five or six inches fl'Om the skin,\nproduced a feeling of burning through his clothes, even when it was\ncompletely shielded, so to speak, by being within the grup of the\nhand of the operator j and mercury in the buIll of a. thermometer gave\nrise to the sa.me feeling, and some convulsions and spasms. Tht-se un-\n-expected results led to the trial on both patients of the action of various\n-drugs at a distance. The attention of the patient was enga.ged during\nthe experiment as far as possible by one of the operators 011 some object\nwhich had nothing to do with the experiment, and no attempt to\nhypnotise the patient was made. Meanwhile the other operator held\n.a solid drug wrapped up in paper, or a liquid in a bottle, a few inches\nbehind the back of the patient's head. After a minute or two, as a.\nrule, the first group of phenomena followed, which were practically\nthe same whatever drug was being used, and which were COll-\nsidered to depend more on the nervous temperament of the patient than\n'On anything else. They were something like their hysterical symptoms\n'When not under experiment j sometimes they became insensible,\nmotionless, lionel appa.rently unconscious j sometimes there were slow\nmovements at first, leading to convulsions or e.xcitement. To the.\nDigitized by Google\n\f60 JOllrllal 01 &Ciet!; lor P,ychical Re,t-at'cn, [0\"-. 188&\nvague initial symptoms succeeded gradually a second group, due\npresumably to the specific action of the drugs employed, which it was\nimportant but sometimes difficult to separate as qccurately as could be\nwished from what had gone before. In this second stage the narcotics\nall produced sleep, but each had its characterilitic features: opium\nproduced a heavy sleep from which it was difficult to roU86 them, and\nwhich left some headache and weariness; chloral produced a lighter\nsleep; morphia a sleep like that of opium, which could be made less\ndeep by the use of atropine; narceine a sleep of a peculiar type, accom-\npanied by salivation, and ending in a sudden waking to a state of\nanxiety and distress. The sleep of codeia, thebaine, and narcotin was\naccompanied by more or less convulsive movement. In the same way\nthe effect of each of the emetics was characteristic; apomorphia pro-\ndu.ced profuse sickness without straining, followed by headache and\ndrowsiness; ipecacuanha led to less sickness but much salivation, and\na peculiar taste in the mouth; tartar emetic to nausea and great\ndepression. So, too, with the alcohols: wine was followed by jovial\nintoxication; amylic alcohol by intoxication with great violence;\naldehyde by rapid and complete prostration, as of dead drunkenness ;\nabsinth by paralysis of the limbs. Orange flower water and camphor\nhad a quieting action, producing natural sleep. The effects of laurel\nwater were unexpected, and its action in consequence was often tested,\nbut found to be always constant in each patient. In the man it pro-\nduced convulsive movements of the thorax, spasmodic breathing, saliva-\ntion and hiccough. In the woman, who was a Jewess, there was first a.\nreligious ecstasy in which she acted a drama of adoration, prayer, and\nrepentance, which was followed by spasmodic breathing, as in the man,\nand ended in sleep. The laurel water contained both prussic acid and\nsome esselltial oil: a weak solution of prussic acid,if held up behind her\nhead, was followed by the ecstatic phenomena; the essential oil by the\nspasmodic breathing; this was considered to contriLute to a. physio-\nlogical analysis of the effects of laurel water.\nValerian produced some bizarre phenomena of excitement as it does\nin cats; cantharides a feeling of burning in mucous surfaces which\nwas stopped by camphor; veratria the symptoms of a cold in the head.\nof a congestion of the back of the nose, and disturbances of sight;\njaborandi and pilocarpin made the patients sweat, and salivated\nthem. The \u00b7anmsthetics were followed first by excitement and after-\nwards by sleep, as in their ordinary surgical use.\nlt was not easy to separate quite exactly the phenomena of the\nfirst stage of excitement from those of the specific action of the drug.\nbut among those which were considered as due to the latter, and\nnot permitting of deceit, the authors reckon the salivation, the\nsweating, the sickness, the sleep, the disturbances of sight, the\nDigitized by Google\n\fOct.,l885.] Jo,,,.nnl qf 8ociet!\/ lor PageMenl Re,eareA. 61\n.ymptoms of alcoholic intoxication, of cold in the head, and the\n.pecific action of valerian and cantharides.\nMM. Bourru and Burot were anxious to submit their experiments\nto the jUdgment of other medical authorities, and requested Dr. Duplouy,\nthe director ofthe School of Naval Medical Officers at :kochefort, to\ngive them the benefit of his opinion. Dr. Duplouy was not inclined\nto accept their startling reports, but consented to investigate the matter\nunder strict conditions. Experiments were made by him in complete\nsilence, and all persons who could be suspected of having influence on\nthe patients were excluded. The professors of the Naval School were\npresent and many naval medical officers. Under the direction of Dr.\nDuplouyan assistant held somejaborandi in a bottle behind the patient's\nhead; salivation and sweating followed as in the experiments of MM.\nBourru and Burot. Another geDtleman during Dr. Duplouy's investiga-\ntion made an experiment which was rendered especially important by a.\nmistake. He had two similar bottles in his pocket, both wrapped in\npaper; one contained cantharides, the other valerian; he chose the one\n....hich he thought contained cantharides IUld held it up to the patient ;\nto hi, surprisethe results which accompany valerian followed, and then he\nfound that he had made a mistake and WILS holding the bc.ttle contain-\ning valerian. Dr. Duplouy admitted at the time that he was con-\nvinced of the accuracy of the observations of MM. Bourru and Burot,\nand ....hen their paper was before the French Association, he made a.\napeech to testify publicly to this conviction on the e\\'idence of his own\nexperiments, which had been very startling to him; he was unable, he\nadmitted, to explain the facts, but he considered any assumption of\nfraud as quite inadmissible. The male patient was transferred to the\nAsylum Lafond at La Rochelle, where the director, Dr. llabille, re-\npea.ted the experiments with tile same results, which were witnessed to\nby the lIedical and No.tural Science Societies of La Rochelle.\nAfter the experiments on their two first and most sensitive subjects\nMM. Bourru and Burot made trials of many others and found some\nless distinct results of tile same kind in a large proportion of them.\nThey declined at Grenoble to pledge themselves to any theory in\nexplanation of these obsenations, but briefly noticed three hypotheses.\nFirst, the theory of suggestion. This they were inclined to think\ninsufficient to cover the facts; for sometimes the results corresponding\nto the drug had been obtained when those making the experiment did\nnot know what drug was lJeillg used; sometimes when the drug was\nknown the results had been very different from what was expected, as\nin the case of laurel water. In tile second place, tile theory of vibrations\nwhich M. Vigouroux had put forward to expla.in tho action of the\nmagnet, did not seem to them to explain (strictly 6peakiD~) Ilnythi~tg,\nbut only, at best, to put it in other language. There remamed a third\nDigitized by Google\n\f62 Jo,w\"al qf Sociefll.for P8.1IC\"\"Cn! Rl'8MI\u00b7ch. [Oct. 1&6_\ntheory, of 0. radiant nervous force, which M. Barety had advocated at.\nNice, in 1881. It was I\\Jl attempt at a conception in analogy\nwith radia.nt heat, or, more strictly, with the action of a magnet.\na.t a distance within its magnetic field. III exceptional cases\nthe nervous system was supposed to be influenced by substances\nwithin 0. limited impressionable nervous field extending to &\nshort distance from the body. In normal conditions there was\ncertainly no evidence of such extension of 0. nervous field; it could not.\nhe directly proved, but might be useful as a provisional hypothesis.\nWe are glad to learn from subsequent correspondence with M.Burot;\nthat these experiments are still being actively carried on, a.nd a detailed\naccount and discussion of them is likely to be soon published. On the\npossibility of suggestion by the help of an abnormally acute s('nse of\nsmell, such as belongs sometimes to hysterical patients, M. Burot.\nremarks that when he made the first experiments he could not imagine -\nthat the patient could have known what physiological effects attach t()\nsome of the drugs, even if they knew what they were by their smell.\na.nd, further, that some~.g., morphia-had no perceptible smell. He\nis inclining to the conclusion that the drugs have no effect when con-\ntained in absolutely sealed tubes, though they act when in bottles with\nground-glass stoppers; and that,we should suppose, must tend to the belief\nthat the results depend ill some way on the presence and diffusion of\nthe drug, and not entirely on any thought-transference or mental\ncondition of the operator. 'Ve ha.ve ventured to suggest some\nfurther experiments, designed to exclude all the possibilities of sugges-\ntion, but have not yet heard of their having been carried out.\nA. T.

Z. related at p. 39 of No. XX. of the\nJournal of the Society for Psychical Research, has tho closest resemblance to\na.n incident related to me by myoid friend, Mias Vaughan, now llIany years\ndead, which I wrote down immediately after hearing it on January 2nd}\n1876, and subsequently submitted for her approval.\nIn the autumn of 1856, aa intimate friend of Miss Vaughan's was dying\nabout 20 miles from London, when one Friday she received a letter from one\nof her daugbters, aaying that as their mother was rather betu.r they should be\nglad to come to London for a special occasion on the following Tuesday. if\n:Miss Vaughan could receive them.\nMias Vaughan then I)roceeds: \"On tho Saturday night I went to bed\nDigitized by Google\n\fOct., t88\/).] Jourl\/al qf Societu .for Psuchical Ilf'lIearcl,. 63\n------\nat my usual hour of 12, but did not go to sleep for some time, when I was\nsuddenly startled by\" three sets of three extraordinary loud knocks, like\nstrokes of a hammer on an empty box at my bed head (whick stood against\nthe party wall of the house), followed immediately by a long loud cry of a\nwoman's voico, which seemed to die away ill the distance. I called my\nmaid instantly and begged her to look out of the window and see if thus\nwas anyone in the street. She opened the shutters, threw up the sa.ah,\nand said there was no one; that I must have been dreaming; that it was\nquite late. I said no, it had not yet struck one, and sent her to look at the\nclock. She returned and said it wanted 10 minutes to one. I said the noise\n(doubtless the knocks) must have coine from the next house. She said it\nwas empty, but this I could not belie,\u00b7e, so I sent her early on Sunday mom.\ning to see. She came back, saying that the windows were all shut, and she\nhad knocked for some time in vain. Ou the following moming I sent her to\nthe person who had charge of the house, thinking that somebody must have\na1ept in it on Saturday night. She said this could not be the case, as she\nhad the key, but she went to look and told me that no one could posaibly\nhave got in.\n\" A very few hoursafterwards I received a letter to tell me that my friend\nbecame suddenly worse on Saturday moming and died in the course of the\nnight. I knew I bad been much in her thoughts, an;! a few days beforo\nher death she had said now she was a little better she hoped she might soon\nbe well enough to see IDe.\n\"Some time subsequently I had an opportunity of seeing the nurse, and\nshe told IDe that my frielld had died exactly at quarter before one on Sunday\nmorning, uttwa,,!1 a loud c\"Y at the momnd (1matlt.

She was staying with a sister at Hastings when\nabe received a letter from Misa Vaughan, telling of her friend's death, \/!ond of\nher having appeare<1 to her. She was greatly interested at this intelligence, and\nhurried up to London, when she helUu from Misa Vaughan the story exactly\nas I have related it down to the news of the death; but as Misa Vaughan\nhad not then seen the nurse and was consequently ignorant of the precise\nagreeDient in the time of her friend's death, and of the fact of her outcry at\nthe moment of dC*~th, she was a little disappointed at the story.

It will be\u00b7\nnoticed that, allowing for longitude, the death occurred,-accordir.g to tIro\nstatements in theletters,-about half-an-hour after the apparition.

I myself W811 living with my elder brother in the kingdom of\nPolaud, in the neighbourhood of the town of Kolo, in the province of\nKalisch, and intended to pass the winter with him. This yearning affected\nme so strongly that I resolved to move to Carlaruhe without delay, which I\nexplained to my brother at breakfast, after I had informed him of my\nsodden feeling. It was no small and insignificant journey in those days\nIUld at that advanced sesaon of the year. Carlsruhe was over 130 German.\nmiles from where I was living. As from childhood I had been specially fond\nof riding, and was possessed of a very valuable and excellent horse of th&\nbest breed, I dt'temlined to make the journey on horseback, IUld mounting\nmy horae at, mid-day on the 10th of November, began my adventurous\ncru!A\u00a5le.

At Jena, where an aunt lived who had always been in the\nmost intimate relations with my mother, I intended to rest for a few days_\nBut as abe told me that she had received very sad newl from Carlarulle,.\naccording to which her dear friend had been attacked by nervous fever and\ngiven up hy the doctors, 1 could not rest, and in the greatest consternation\nand anxiety recommenced my journey, and reached Carlllruhe on the 4th of\nDecember. With sinking heart I bAtook myself first to my brother, who-\nwas attached to the Ruaaian Embassy at the Court of Baden, rushed up the\nsteps, where my brother received me in great astc:.nishment, and on my\neager inquiry nfter my mother's health, told l11e that the danger had passed\noff (had been turned off), and that she was recovl'ring. Then 1 hurried\nswiftly to my mother's house, where my sisters lived with her, and they con-\nfinned the happy neW8. As I then learnt from my elde8t sister, the chief\ncrisis of the illne8S occurred on the night between the 9th and 10th of\nNovember. when my btlloved mother, in her delirium, continually spoke with.\nintense love and care for her youngest son, called me and longed for me.

[Oct., 1885.\nAbout 16 years ago, the sister next to me in age and myself occupied\nthe same bedroom, but slept in separate beds, about three feet apart. The\napproach to our room was by a long, narrow passage, and the unly window in\nthe room overlooked the high. alated roof of uur large schooiroom, which abut\nout any view of the surrounding country. It was uur rule to sleep with the\ndoor shut and bolted. One morning, between 1 and 2 a. m., I dreamt that I\nwas lying in my bed wide awake, when, to my great surprise, I perceived that\nthe door was fully open. I was wondering how this could be, when I &aW,\napproaching down the pa.asa.ge, a vivid red light, which gradually (as it came\nnearer) became redder and redder. In my horror I gave a loud scream, which\nawakened me, and before I had time to say une word, my sister started up,and\ncalled out, \"Oh! Emmy,whatis thatred ligh~onthe roofopposite t' A moment\nafterwards, when fully awake, we saw that the room was in darkn('.ss, and on\n8triking a light, that the door was shut and locked, as when we went to bed.\nThis dream made a powerful impression upon us both.

Results--\ntable-tilting, raps, &c.-were obtained, which, if they could have been\nobtained under satisfactory tests, would have been conclusive; but 88 such\ntesta could not be applied, I myself and other members of the Committee\nwere not convinced that th8lle phenomena were not the result of fraud,\nconscious or unconscious.\nThis view could, of course, not be put forward without wounding the\nfeelings of other members of the Committee, and, therefore, I Jlersonally\ndeemed it undesirable to present allY report on these inquiries.\nThose members of the Committee who were not convinced of the genuine\ncharacter of tl.8II1l phenomena wished to continue the investigatif'ns, but this\nwe were unable to do.\nAs we could not procure the aBBistance of other private mediums, it was\ndecidod that seven members of the Physical Phenomena Committee, together\nwith other members of the Society, should sit-inf<>nually--with Mr.\nEglinton.

When the matter was afterwards informally discussed in the\nCouncil, I expressed a similar opinion, and I belie\"e that my view\nwas shared by one or two other members present; but-so far as I\nrecollect-no formal resolution was passed.\nI have written tills, not by way of criticism on Mr. HughesP\nstatement, which appears to me very fairly to represent the facts of\nthe case, but merely to take upon myself the share of responsibility\nthat properly belongs to me for the course taken by his Committee.\nH.

Can\nanyone tell me how the Society could investigate them without having .'\nrepresentative billeted in the hoUle, which would be utterly distasteful to.\nIII, and (I &peak from experience) destructive of the phenomena 1\nLet me refer to \u2022 few of the phenomena in illustration of this. The fire-\nlighting (by agency to anyone invisible but our medium, who ill clairvoyante-)\nhas now gone on continuously under our own closestobservation for over two\nyean, not in the early moming only, but at all hoUl'll of the day, in many\nrooms, and under many conditions. Sceptical ~t tint &I to its origin, anJ\nexercising, &I we did, the clOleBt scrutiny, our spirit friends were often\nunable, even when they wanted to render us this help, to do 10. If we\nounelves aaaume the detective attitude, and try to catch the fire.liI(hten in\nthe act, our watching spoils the conditions, and we are obliged to become\npuaive before the phenomena can be resumed. Even under conditions of\ntheir own suggestion they have failed, while under conditions as absolutely\ntesting, taken at the spur of the moment, they have succeeded: and now\nwe have recorded what we have oUl'llOlves \"en. I am quite aware how a.\necientitic mind, devoid of faith in the origin which we are now a.urea of..\ncan 10 manipUlate these statements of mine &I to prove that we are. or may\nbe, or must be, all under a delusion: but if testimony ill to be taken, and\nto gather force by accumulation, we can recount CUt'll which only have to be-\nmultiplied by what would be deemed to be a sufficient number for the fact.\nto be established. Your apace forbids the noceBl&ry detail. But how could\nthe Society (&I such) teat the truth of our &lBertions? Suppose you lent a\ndelegate : would he Bee more than I did myself in the initiation of these-\nfire\u00b7lightinga, when I watched, shivering in an overcoat, night and moming 1\nI can hardly think 10; but, though hiB failure could not prove a negative, it\nwould nourish acepticiBm and complicate our poaition.

Fire-lighting, then, by occult power must, it BeelUS, for\nthe present be acceptel on t 'stimoll!l or not at all, and it seems to me one\nof the 108sons investigators have to learn is how to revise the laws of\nscientific evidence so as to moet the subtle and delicate conditions of\npsychical phenomena when personal scrutiny is impossible. The II\\llle\nholds good-perhaps even in a greater measure-WI regards the COIll-\np!ete making of tea by occult power, from kettles previously, by the\nsame power, filled and brought to the boiling point, and thl: frequent;\ntransportation of material objects from one place to another, notably of\nboiling water fl'Om one kettle to another at a distance. You must fimt\ndevelop clairvoyance among your delegates befuro they can aee in our hoU88\neither the actors or the l)henom~na, and then you must settle among your-\nselves how evidence of this kind is to be dealt with. These things c~nnl)t;\nbe done at our bidding or 1 would gladly ask the Society in II. body to come\nand see for themselves; but any delegate set to watch would be as inadmiss-\nable as a privat.e detective-and the results would be merely negative. And\nyet the phenomena occur: they not only exist-they abound; and we have\nstaked our reputation for truth and accuracy on what we have recorded. We\nhave sacrificed a great dMI to obtain such a happy facility of exposition in\noar midst, but we are not prepared for perpetual detective supervision. The\ntheories created under such conditions, even if the phenomena occurred,\nwould only lead to the requirement of further tests, and probably put an\nend to their re::urrellCd.

These writings-notwithstanding some very\nh!\\5ty and foolish criticisms-bear on the surface of them prima facie evidence\nof abnormal origin, even if the one of which we are convinced cannot be\na::cepted. Some writings were placed, at my request, on the ceilings (I will\nrefer to one presently), and 1 am convinced that:no other than an occult\ntheory can be sustained for one moment after a proper examination of the\nwritings themselves and of the circumstances purrounding them. 1 regret\nthat ceilings in Granville Park sha.re the fate of others, and aro not impervious\nto smoke and dust, so that most of the original writings have caught the\nwhite-washer's \"distemper,\" and vanished.

On these two going upstairs together they\nmet the bath in t,'al&3itu ! and 80 paased it on the stairs. A few minutes\narter, on coming down, the said bath had reached the landing on the first\nfloor. Here Mary atayed to have a bath (I mention this fact as important)\nand my daughter went down to the ground floor. As aoon as ahe heard Mary\ncome out of the bath\u00b7room she ran up to meet her, and found that during the\ntimeMary had been in the bath-roomtheheavypackage had boen taken down-\nstairs to the front door, and, moreover, all the other luggage had alao been\ntaken down from the top of the houae and placed on the top of the bath.\nHere is a case of transportation the evidence for which is entirely IUp\u00b7\nported by the word of my daughter and Mary jointly, but it is a thing that\nprobably would not have happened if a watcher had been there! 1 have no\nlea80n whatever for disbelieving, but every reason for accepting their assertion.\nAgaiu, last Sunday evening at Haslemere, during our family Hance, 1\nhad a long conversation with a spirit speaking through Mary, entranced.\nThe conversation was entirely beyond her in her normal state, and went into\nthe question of passing matter through matter: but it is to a promise then\nmade-not only by this voice, but alao by direct 3pirit.wrWllg a few minutt>a\nlater, that I wish now to refer, as it has since been carried out under perfect\ntest conditions.
