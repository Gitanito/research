I could not help\ncarrying my inquiries about them as far as I was able. My studies this way hace\nproduc'd a vast quantity of drawings and writing, whic\u1ed5 con\u017fider'd as ai intire\nwork, may thus be intitled,\nPatriarchal C H R 1 s T I A N 1 T y :\nO R ,\nA Chronological H I S T O R Y\nO F T H E\nOrigin and Progre\u017fs of true Religion, and of Idolatry.\nThe parts of which the whole is compos\u2019d are the\u017f\u00ea:\nI. Canon Mo\u017faic\u00e6 Chronologi\u00e6, or the year of Mo\u017fes fettled, by which le\nreckons time in the history of the old world; the time of the year fix\u2019d when cre\nation was begun. This is done in a new manner, and becomes an intire \/ stem of\nchronologyfrom the creation to the Exodus, and is exemplified by many particular\nKalendars of the most remarkable tran\u017factions; which are proofs of the truth of\nthe Canon. There are inter\/per\u017fed a great many astronomical and historical illu\nstrations of the Jacred pages, particularly Sanchoniathon's genealogies, and Ma\nnethon's Egyptian Dynasties, are applied in a new Method to the history and\nchronology of the Scriptures.\nII. Melchi\u017fedec, or a delineation of the first and patriarchal religion, from\nthe best light we can gather in the facred history; and from the most ancient hea\nthen customs, which were remains of that religion. In this Treatif it is flewn,\nthat the first religion was no other than Christianity, the Mo\u017f\u00e0ic di\u017fpen\u017fation, as\na veil, intervening; that all mankind from the creation had a knowledge of the\nplurality of per\u017fons in the Deity.\nIII. Ofthe mysteries of the ancients, one of the first deviations from true reli\ngion, to idolatry; this is chiefly purf\u00fc'd in an explication of the famous table of\nIfis, or Bembin-table, publi\u017fh\u2019d by Pignorius, Kircher, &c. wherein that know\nledge which the ancients had concerning the true nature of the Deity, is further\nexplain'd,\n( a ) IV. A dist\n\fP R E F A C E.\nIV. A di\u017fcour\u017fe on the hieroglyphic learning of the ancients, andof the origin of\nthe alphabet of letters. Very many hieroglyphic monuments of the Egyptians are\nexplain'd, more e\u017fpecially tho\u017fe that relate to their true notions of the per\u017f\u00f3ns in the\nDeity. The time and rife of the alphabet of letters is deduc'd from a new founda\ntion. The pre\u017fent \/\u1eaduare Hebrew characters are fhewn to be the primitive idea of\ndetters, from whence all others are deriv'd. Whence the idea of every letter was\ntaken ? an explication of all the old Hebrew coins with Samaritan chara\u010diers.\nV. The patriarchal history, particularly of Abraham, is largely purf\u00fc'd; and\nrhe deduction of the Phoenician colony into the I\u017fland of Britain, about or\/fion after\nhis time; whence the origin of the Druids, of their Religion and writing; they\nhrought the patriarchal Religion along with them, and \/\u00f4me knowledge of\/fmbols\nor hieroglyphics, like tho\u017fe of the ancient Egyptians; they had the notion and ex\npe\u010diation of the Meffiah, andof the time of theyear when he was to be born, of his\noffice and death.\nVI. Of the Temples of the Druids in Britain, their religious rites, orders, fa\ncrifices, groves, tombs, their cur\u017fus's, places of\/forts and exercifes, &c. particu\nlarly an ample and accurate de\u017fcription of that stupendous temple of theirs at\nAbury in North Wilt\u017fhire, the most august work at this day upon the globe of the\nearth; with many prints of ground-plots, views and admeaf\u00fcrements of all its\nparts; of their manner of Jepulture; an account of my digging into many of their\nharrows and tumuli, with drawings of them, &c.\nVII. Of the celebrated Stonehenge, another Temple of theirs, with prints of\nthat work; an account ofthe barrows I dug up, and what was di\u017fcover\u2019d in them ;\nof the knowledge the Druids bad of the magnetical compa\u00df, and conje\u010dtures of the\nparticular times when the\u017fe works were made, long before C\u00e6\u017far arriv'din Britain.\nI propost to publi\u017fh the\u017fe two first, and proceed to the \u017fpeculative parts after\nwards; re\u017ferving them, God willing, to the maturer time of my life.\nMy intent is (be\u017fides pre\u017ferving the memory of the\u017fe extraordinary monuments,\n.fo much to the honour ofour country, now in great danger of ruin) to promote, as\nmuch as I am able, the knowledge and pra\u0107fice of ancient and true Religion; to\nrevive in the minds of the learned the \u017fpirit of Christianity, nearly as old as the\nCreation, which is now langui\u017fhing among us; to restore the first andgreat Idea of\nthe Deity, who has carry'd on the fame regular andgolden chain of Religion from\nthe beginning to this day ; to warm our hearts into that true Jen\u017fe of Religion,\nwhich keeps the medium between ignorant f\u00fcperstition and learned free-thinking,\nbetween \/lovenly fanatici\u017fm and popi\/b pageantry, between enthu\/ia\/in and the ra\ntional wor\u017fhip of God, which is no where upon earth done, in my judgment, better\nthan in the Church of England. And feeing a \u017fpirit of Sceptici\/in has of late\nbecome f0 fa\u017fhionable and audacious as to strike at the fundamentals of all revela\ntion, I have endeavoured to trace it back to the fountain of Divinity, whence it\nflows ; and fhew that Religion is one \/ystem as old as the world, and that is the\nChristian Religion; that God did not leave the rational part of his creation, like\nthe colony of an ant-bill, with no other guide than instin\u010d7, but proportion'd his\ndi\u017fcoveries to the age of the world, to the learning, wi\u017fdom, and experience of it ;\nas a wife parent does now to his children. I fball \/bew likewife, that our prede\nceffors, the Druids of Britain, tho' left in the extremest west to the improvement of\ntheir own thoughts, yet advanc'd their inquiries, under all di\u017fadvantages, to fich\nheights, as \u017fhould make our moderns afham'd, to wink in the fin-fhine of learning\nand religion. And we may with reaf\u00f3n conclude, there was fomewhat very ex\ntraordinary in tho\u017fe principles, which prompted them to fuch a noble \/pirit as pro\nduced the\u017fe works, still vi\u017fible with us, which for grandeur, \/implicity and anti\nguity, exceed any \u00baf the European wonders, Thaf\n\fP R E F A C E.\nThat the do\u0107irines and works ofthe Druids have bitherto been \/6 little confider\ned (\u017fince authors only tran\u017fcribe from one to another, the few remaining \u017f\u00earaps to\nbe found in claffic writers) was an incentive to me likewi\u017f\u00e8 in the following at\ntempt, and at the fame time it pleads for me, and be\u017fpeaks the reader's favour.\nI want likewife the great advantages to be had from a knowledge of the remaining\nCeltic languages, books, manu\u017fcripts, and history, the Corni\u017fh, Wel\u017fh, Iri\u017fh,\nHighland, &c. the chief repo\u017fitory now of their doctrines and customs ; \/o that in\nmy own opinion I may very well\/ay with the poet,\nInterea Dryadum filvas & faxa fequamur\nInta\u0107tas, tua Mec\u00e6nas haud mollia justa. Virgil.\nAnd tho' there has been oflate a large volume publi\u017fh'd on the \u017fubject ofStone\nhenge, yet we may well \/ay there has nothing been wrote upon the \u017fubje\u010di. Nor\nhave I any other notion of this performance, than that it is as a first attempt to\nfay fomething upon tho\u017fe famous philo\u017fophers and priests the Druids, who are never\n\u017fpoken of in antiquity but with a note of admiration; and are always rank'd with\nthe Magi of the Perfians, the gymno\u017fophists of the Indians, the prophets and hie\nrophants of the Egyptians, and tho\u017fe \/\u00f6rt of patriarchal priests, who\u017fe orders com\nmenc'd before idolatry began; from whom the Pythagoreans, Platoni\u017fts, and Greek\nphilo\u017fophers learn'd the best things they knew. To clear away rubbi\u017fh, and lay a\nfoundation only, in this difficult and ob\u017fcure work, is doing \/\u00f4mewhat. The method\nof writing which I have chof\u00e8 is a diffu\u017five one, not pretending to a formal and\nflif\/cholastic proof of every thing Ifay, which would be odious and irk\u017fome to the\nreader, as well as my\u017felf. The knowledge I have acquired in the\u017f\u00eb matters, was\nfrom examining and studying their works; the proofs are deriv'd from distant and\ndiff\u00e9rent topicks, and it would be very inconvenient to marfbal them \/ llogistically\nin a work of this nature; the proof re\u017fults from the intire work; in all matters of\n\/6 great antiquity it must befound out by the reader; and to one that has proper\nJagacity andjudgment, conviction will steal upon him in\u017fen\u017fibly, if I am not mi\u017f:\ntaken; and he will own the evidence in general, is as strong as the nature of the\nfubje\u0107i will bear, or requires.\nIt was very di\u017fagreeable to me that I was forc'd to combat against a book pub\nlist'd in the name of the celebrated Inigo Jones, for whof\u00e8 memory I have the\ngreatest regard. I wonder the publi\u017fher of that work did not think of a very eal\u00fd\nmethod to convince him\u017felf that he was in an error. If Stonehenge is a Roman\nwork, it was certainly built by the Roman \/cale; had be reduc'd his own meaf\u00fcres\nto that standard, he would have feen the ab\u017furdity of his opinion; for we cannot\nthink that a temple, or elegant building, as he would have it, fhould not fhew its\nfounders by the \/cale on which it is form\u2019d; they are all fra\u010dtions in the Roman\nJeale, undoubted evidence that the Romans had no hand in it. For there is no\nmeaning, no de\u017fign in the choice ofthe mea\u017fures, neither in general nor particu\nlar; a thing unworthy of a great architeti, or a great de\u017fign. But it appears\nvery evident to me, that Inigo Jones had little or no part in that work, e\u017fpecially\nas it is moulded at pre\u017fent ; and I think I have rea\u017fon to beof opinion that he never\ndrew the de\u017figns therein publi\u017fhed, becau\u017fe I \u017fhould be unwilling to\/ay be knowingly\nfal\u017fified them. I have very much fhortened what Ihad to \u017fay against that book,\nbecau\u017fe I have no love for wrangling, and barely mention'd what was neceffary,\nthat the reader may have a true notion of this noble antiquity.\n*\n\f\f\f\"\/.

That it was a temple of\nthe Druids, of the patriarchal mode, who were a most ancient\noriental colony. In luter times, the Belg\u00e6 from the continent,\nconquer'd this country from them. Whence the\u017fe stones were\nhrought ? Of their nature, magnitude, weight. Of the mea\nfure of the Druids, the ancient Hebrew cubit, and its propor\ntion to the Engli\u017fh foot. -\nTH E Wilt\u017fhire downs, or Sali\u017fbury plain, (as commonly call'd) for\nextent and beauty, is, without controver\u017fy, one of the mo\u017ft delight\nful parts of Britain. But of late years great encroachments have\nbeen made upon it by the plough, which threatens the ruin of this\nfine champain, and of all the monuments of antiquity thereabouts. Monu\nments, we can \u017fcarce \u017fay, whether more wonderful in them\u017felves, more ob\nferv'd, or le\u017fs under\u017ftood! among them, Stonehenge has been eminent from the\nremote\u017ft ages, tho' 'tis not the greate\u017ft, mo\u017ft confiderable, or mo\u017ft ancient.\nBut 'tis my intent to begin my di\u017fcour\u017fe from it, becau\u017fe the late\u017ft, and from\nthence proceed upwards in our inquiries, about the times and authors of the\u017fe\nftupendous works, the temples of the Druids in our I\u017fland: for I cannot doubt\nthat Stonehenge was fuch. The idea we conceive of the di\u017ftance of time, when\nthe\u017fe kind of works were made, cannot be ill-form'd, if we confider, that the\nutmo\u017ft accounts of 'em we have in writing, are from the Britons, the remains\nof the people who lived here, at the time of the Roman inva\u017fion. This is men\ntion d in f\u00f2me manu\u017fcripts of Ninnius before the Saxons and Danes came over.\nAnd the olde\u017ft Britons \u017fpeak of this only by tradition, far above all memorial.\nThey wonder'd at Stonehenge then, and were as far to feek about the founders\nand intent of it, as we now. They have recour\u017fe to magic, as is u\u017fual, when\nthey would account for any thing \u017feemingly fo much above human power, to\naccompli\u017fh. They tellus, the\u017fe \u017ftones of immen\u017fe bulk were brought from a\nplain, in the middle of Ireland, and the like. Which reports give us only no\nob\u017fcure hint of their true authors, the Druids, who were fam'd for magic,\n- '' B ' ' and\n\fJ' 7' 0 N E H E N G E\nTAB. I.\nand were driven la\u017ft into Ireland, in the time of the Romans. There they built.\nfuch like works again, or their brethren had built before; till Christianity, to\nwhich the greate\u017ft and pure\u017ft part of their own do\u0107trine was akin, foon put\nan end to their polity, which the Roman arms could not do. And they em\nbrac'd that religion, to which their own opinions and rites had fo direct a ten\ndency. This is the \u017fentiment of Origen on Ezekiel iv. And 'tis \u017fufficiently\nevident, if wc confider, that the fir\u017ft planters of Chri\u017ftianity in Ireland, im\nmediately converted the whole i\u017fland, without fo much as the blood of one\nmartyr. Nay, the Druids them\u017felves, at that time the only national priests,\nembraced it readily, and fome of them were very zealous preachers of it, and\neffe\u0107tual converters of others. For in\u017ftance, the great Columbanus him\u017felf was\na Druid: the apo\u017ftle of Ireland, Cornwall, &c. We need not be \u017furpriz'd at\nthis, when we affert, that there is very much rea\u017fon to believe, the\u017fe famous\nphilo\u017fophic priests came hither, as a Phanician colony, in the yery earlieft\ntimes, even as foon as Tyre was founded : during the life of the patriarch\nAbraham, or very foon after. Therefore they brought along with them the\npatriarchal religion, which was fo extremely like Christianity, that in effe\u0107t it\ndiffer'd from it only in this; they believed in a Mefiah who was to come into\nthe world, as we believe in him that is come. Further, they came from that\nvery country where Abraham liv'd, his fons and grandfons; a family God al\nmighty had \u017feparated from the gro\u017fs of mankind, to \u017ftifle the feeds of idola\ntry; a mighty prince, and preacher of righteou\u017fne\u017fs. And tho' the memoirs\nof our Druids are extremely \u017fhort, yet we can very evidently di\u017fcover from\nthem, that the Druids were of Abraham's religion intirely, at leaft in the ear\nlie\u017ft times, and wor\u017fhipp'd the \u017fupreme Being in the fame manner as he did,\nand probably according to his example, or the example of his and their com\nmon ance\u017ftors.\nAll this I \u017fhall prove, \u00een the pur\u017fuit of this work. But before we come to\nfpeculation, intend to give an exa\u0107t de\u017fcription of their feveral temples, and the\nlike works; for \u017fuch will be a good foundation for us to build upon. That\nwe may proceed from things evident and more known, to tho\u017fe le\u017fs known,\nand which we defign to make evident, as well as we are able, and the nature\nof it will permit. A matter \u017fo immers'd in the dark mi\u017ft of time, where very\nfew \u017fcatter'd traces remain, mu\u017ft needs be\u017fpeak the reader's candor. The dig\nnity of the \u017fubje\u0107t will excu\u017fe my boldne\u017fs in attempting one fo difficult. And\nhowever I \u017fucceed in accounting for the\u017fe wonderful works; at leaft, I \u017fhall be\nin\u017ftrumental in pre\u017ferving their memory, in givingjuft drawings of them.\nStonehenge, by the extravagant grandeur of the work, has attra\u0107ted the eyes\nand admiration of all ages. After the reformation, upon the revival of learning\namong us, the curious began to confider it more intimately, I cannot fay fuc\nce\u017fsfully. Mr. Camden ro\u017fe as the fun of antiquity, that put out former lights,\nand, like C\u00e6\u017far, affrights all that value a reputation, from attempting any thing\nin his way. His great \u017fkill in Roman learning, and our Engli\u017fh hi\u017ftory, only\nenabled him to be, as it were, filent on Stonehenge. He \u017faw with excellent\njudgment, that neither Roman nor Engli\u017fh had place there, or could ferve to il\nluftrate it. He writes modeftly, as his manner was; \u201c Of the\u017fe things I am\n\u201c not able fo much to give an accurate account, as mightily to grieve, that\n\u201c the founders of this noble monument cannot be trac'd out.\u201d He could not\nper\u017fuade him\u017felf that either Romans, Saxons or Danes had any hand in it. And\nas for his repre\u017fentation of it in pi\u0107ture, I verily believe, it was drawn only\nfrom fancy or memory, or by fome engraver from his oral de\u017fcription. A. D.\n162o, king fames I. being at the earl of Pembroke's feat at Wilton, and agreea\nbly \u017furpriz\u2019d with the fight of Stonehenge, con\u017fulted the famous archite\u0107t Inigo\nfones, upon it; thinking it a matter in his way. This great man, who de\nfervedly may be \u017ftiled the Engli\u017fh Vitruvius, gave his opinion of it, as a Ro\nman work; and left, I \u017fuppo\u017fe, \u017fome few indige\u017fted notes in writing there\nupon.\n\fA \\\\\n|\n\u00a7\u0160,\u00a7\n|;\n\\\\ ,\n}*\nW\n\u00a7\nWAR\n\"\n\\\\\nMWAW\nNANNA\nNANMV\nMW\nN\n\"\")\n\\\\\n* N RR\n- N\nF\u00d6R\u00c4N\nw w\nR\nN N\n' , \"W\nV \/\nEI\nWWW\nW |\n|\n11\nWW\n|\n| (WWF\n|\n-\nIII. |- E, !| 1\nW\n1 \\ ,\nl' . \u00bb \"\n| \"I w.\n* *\n|\n|\n|\n|\n:\na st\n\\\\ \\\\\nRR \\ A\nw\n*\ns* ~\nx & S S s s s.\n*s\n,\ns\nRNRA * : RYSSE\n----\nRNA \\ .\nFA TA *\nS\n-\n\f\fD E s c R 1 B E D.\nupon.

And as\nmy Lord Bi\u017fhop of London well ob\u017ferves, in his notes on Camden, \u201cit cannot be\n\u201c \u017fafe to clo\u017fe with Mr. fones, tho\u2019 his book otherwife be a learned and ingeni\n\u201c ous piece.\u201d Inigo fones lived 3o years after this, and yet Mr. Webb makes an\napology for his work, \u201c that if he had furviv'd to have done it, with his own\n\u201c hand, it would have been better.\u201d But 'tis very rea\u017fonably believ'd, that tho\u2019\nwas an extraordinary genius in archite\u0107ture, yet he wanted many\nqualifications for an author, e\u017fpecially in \u017fuch a work as Stonehenge. \u2019Tis my\nopinion, that had his archite\u0107tonic \u017fkill been united to Mr. Camden's learning,\nhe could never have demon\u017ftrated Stonehenge to be a Roman work. After\nwards, Dr. Charlton publi\u017fh'd a piece again\u017ft Webb's performance, and certain\nly has \u017faid enough to overthrow it, tho\u2019 he could not with equal \u017fucce\u017fs esta\nbli\u017fh his own opinion, that it was the work of the Danes. Whereas Olaus M\u2019or\nmius finds no fuch monuments among the Gothic nations: which, as Mr. T%\nland ob\u017ferves, is an\u017fwer \u017fufficient to his allegation. Webb an\u017fwer'd the Do\u0107tor's\nbook, and by turns effe\u0107tually demoli\u017fh'd his opinion, but could not still vin\ndicate his own. Yet from all their di\u017fputations, no \u017fpark was \u017ftruck, towards\na di\u017fcovery of the real truth. What is the wor\u017ft part in both performances of\nMr. Webb, his repre\u017fentation of the real monument in his drawings, is fi&titi\nous. And, as Mr. Aubry rightly ob\u017ferves, \u201cin endeavouring to retrieve a piece of\n\u201c archite\u0107ture in Vitruvius, he abu\u017fes the reader with a fal\u017fe repre\u017fentation ofthe\n\u201c whole.\u201d It requires no great pains to prove this, nor need we take much time\nto be fatisfy'd in it: the work is still extant. As foon as ajudicious eye comes\nupon the \u017fpot, we di\u017fcern that Webb's equilateral triangles forming the cell are\nfancies: his three entrances acro\u017fs the ditch are fo too; and that he has turn'd\nthe cell a fixth part from its true fituation, to favour his imaginary hypothe\u017fis.\nBut 'tis again\u017ft my inclination to find fault with the labours of others, nor do\nI thereby \u017feek to bribe the reader in my own favour. I had a great plea\u017fure for\nfeveral years together, in viewing and examining the\u017fe noble remains of our\nance\u017ftors. What I wrote about them, was for my private amu\u017fement, and that\nof friends. And I publi\u017fh them only for the honour of my country, and in\nhopes that \u017fuch a publication will not be un\u017ferviceable to religion; which is\nmy ultimate view.\nTho' Stonehenge be the proude\u017ft fingularity of this fort, in the world, as far\nas we know : yet there are fo many others, manife\u017ftly form\u2019d upon the fame,\nor kindred defign, by the fame mea\u017fure, and for the fame purpo\u017fe, all over the\nBritanic i\u017fles; that we can have no room to doubt of their being made by the\nfame people, and that by dire\u0107tion of the Briti\u017fh Druids. There are innume\nrable, from the land's end in Cornwall, to the utmo\u017ft northern promontory in\nScotland, where the Roman power never reach'd. They are to be found in all\nthe i\u017flands between Scotland and Ireland, ifle of Man, all the Orkney iflands,\n&c. and numerous in Ireland it\u017felf. And there is no pretence, as far as I can\nfee, for any other per\u017fons or nations being the founders of them. They are\ncircles of \u017ftones, generally rude, of different diameters, upon elevated ground,\nbarren, open heaths and downs; chiefly made of \u017ftones taken from the fur\nface of the ground. There are no remembrances of the founders, any other\nthan an uninterrupted tradition of their being \u017facred; that there is medicinal\nvirtue in them; that they were made by the Iri\u017fh; that they were brought\nfrom Afric; that they were high-places of wor\u017fhip; fan\u0107tuaries; bowing, ado\nring places; and what names they commonly have, intimate the fame thing.\nAnd in many places the expre\u017fs remembrance and name of Druids remain,\nand the people bury their dead in or near them to this day, thinking them ho\nly ground. Mr. Toland in his hi\u017ftory of the Druids, p. 23. tells us, \u201c In\n\u201c Gealcoffa's mount in Ini\u017foen in the county of Dunegal, a Druide\u017fs of that\n- - ** name\n\fS 7' 0 N E H E N G E\nTA B.\nXXXIV.\nTAB. II.\n\u201c name lived; it fignifies white-legg'd, according to the ancient manner in\n\u201c Homer's time. On that hill is her grave and her temple, being a fort of di\n\u201c minutive Stonehenge, which the old Iri\u017fh, at this day, dare not any way\n\u201c profane.\u201d Many instances of this fort, of all the\u017fe particulars, we have in\nour i\u017fland: particularly the temple on Temple-downs by Abury. Whatever is\ndug up in or near the\u017fe works are manife\u017ftly remains of the Druid times; urns,\nbones, ornaments of amber, gla\u017fs beads, fnake-\u017ftones, amulets, celts, flint\nhatchets, arrow-heads, and \u017fuch things as be\u017fpeak the rude\u017ft ages, the utmo\u017ft\nantiquity, mo\u017ft early plantations of people that came into our ifland, foon af\nter Noah's flood. I have all the rea\u017fon in the world to believe them an orien\ntal colony of Ph\u00e6nicians; at leaft that \u017fuch a one came upon the fir\u017ft Celtic\nplantation of people here: which rea\u017fons will appear in the progre\u017fs of this\ndi\u017fcour\u017fe. I \u017fuppo\u017fe in matters of \u017fuch extraordinary antiquity, it would be\nab\u017furd to fet about a formal demon\u017ftration; and tho\u017fe readers would be alto\ngether unrea\u017fonable, that expe\u0107t we prove every fa\u00e9t here, as they would do\nby living witne\u017f\u017fes, before a court ofjudicature. When all is confider'd, that\nI have put together on this affair, a judicious perfon, I pre\u017fume, will agree, I\nhave made the matter \u017fufficiently evident, and as much as the nature of things\nrequires.\nIn the times ju\u017ft preceding the coming of the Romans into Britain, the Bel\ngae, a mo\u017ft powerful colony from the Gallic continent, had firmly feated\nthem\u017felves all over the country, where Stonehenge is fituate, quite to the fou\nthern fea; taking in the \u017fouth part of Wilt\u017fhire, and all Dorf\u00e8t\/hire. Wilt\nfhire has its name from the river Willy, which in Wel\u017fh is wyli, in Latin, va\ngire, from its noi\u017fe. A river of like name in Northampton\/hire. Upon the\nformer river at Wilton, probably liv'd the Carvilius, one of the four kings\nthat fought fulius C\u00e6\u017far, the pi\u0107ture of who\u017fe tumulus we have given towards\nthe end. The Belgae carne into Britain upon the \u017fouth, as other Celtic nations\nbefore had fix'd them\u017felves from the ea\u017ft, Kent, the Thames, &c. fuch as the\nCantii, Segontiaci, Atrebates, &c. \u017fo that in Cae\u017far's time, all the \u017fouth and\nea\u017ft parts of Britain were difpoffe\u017fs'd of their original inhabitants, and peopled\nfrom the continent : and this very work of Stonehenge was in the hands of the\nBelg\u00e6, who built it not. In my itinerarium curiofilm, p. 181. I ob\u017ferv'd no\nle\u017fs than four \u017fucce\u017f\u017five boundary ditches here, from the fouthern fhore; which\nwith good rea\u017fon, I \u017fuppos'd, were made by the Belg\u00e6, as they conquer'd the\ncountry by degrees, from the aboriginal inhabitants. This fhews, they mu\u017ft\nhave been a long while about it, that the Britons di\u017fputed every inch of ground\nwith them, and that for two rea\u017fons; as well becau\u017fe of the extraordinary\nbeauty and goodne\u017fs of the country, as fighting pro aris & focis for their great\ntemple of Stonehenge: not to \u017fpeak of that other greater temple, a little more\nnorthward, at Abury. The Segontiaci had got Hamp\u017fhire, to the ea\u017ft of\nthem, before, as far as the Colinburn river, and the Atrebates, Berk\u017fhire. The\nfir\u017ft ditch runs between the river of Blandford, formerly Alauna, and the ri\nver of Bere, the piddle in Dorf\u00eat\/hire, two or three miles fouth of it.\nThe fecond runs to the north of Cranborn cha\u017fe, upon the edge of Wilt\u017fhire,\nby Pentridg: it divides the counties of Dor\u017fet and Wilts. The third is con\u017fpi\ncuous upon Sali\u017fbury plain, as we pa\u017fs from Wilton to Stonehenge, about the\ntwo-mile ftone, north of Wilton: it is drawn between the river Avon and the\nWilly, from Dornf\u00f6rd to Newton. The fourth is the more famous Wan\u017fdike,\nof great extent. Gwahan in old Briti\u017fh fignifies \/ paratio, distin\u00e9fio guahann\nfeperare, and that undoubtedly gave name to the ditch. The method of all\nthe\u017fe ditches, is, to take the northern edge of a ridge of hills, which is al\nways \u017fteep; the bank is on the \u017fouth fide. And in my itinerary, p. 134. I\nfhow'd a mo\u017ft evident demon\u017ftration, that it was made before the time of the\nRomans, in the pa\u017f\u017fage of the Roman road down Runway hill. TAB.

And mo\u017ft probably it was built be\nfore the Belgae fet footing in Britain, becau\u017fe of the great number of b\u1ea1rrows\nor \u017fepulchral tumuli about it, which, no doubt, were made for the burial of\nkings and great men.\nThe ftones of which Stonehenge is compos'd, beyond any controver\u017fy, came\nfrom tho\u017fe called the gray weathers, upon Marlborough downs near Abury;\nwhere is that other mo\u017ft wonderful work of this fort, which I \u017fh\u1ea7ll de\u017fcribe\nin my next volume. This is 15 or 16 miles off. All the greater \u017ftones are of\nthat fort, except the altar, which is of a \u017ftill harder, as de\u017fign'd to refi\u017ft fire.\nThe pyramidals likewife are of a different fort, and much harder than the re\u017ft,\nlike tho\u017fe of that other Druid temple call'd the Weddings, at Stanton-drew in\nSomer\u017fet\u017fhire. Dr. Halley was at Stonehenge in the year 172o, and brought a\npiece of it to the Royal Society. I examin'd it with a micro\u017fcope. \u2019Tis a\ncompo\u017fition of cry\u017ftals of red, green and white colours, cemented together by\nnature's art, with opake granules of flinty or ftony matter. The Do\u0107tor ob\nferv'd from the general wear of the weather upon the ftones, that the work mu\u017ft\nbe of an extraordinary antiquity, and for ought he knew, 2 or 3ooo years old.\nBut had the Doctor been at Abury, which is made ofthe fame ftones, he might\nwell from the like argumentation conclude, that work as old again as Stonelenge,\nat lea\u017ft much older, and I verily believe it. Neverthele\u017fs the current of \u017fo ma\nny ages has been more merciful to Stonehenge, than the infolence of rapacious\nhands, (befides the general \u017faccage brought upon the work of old) by the un\naccountable folly of mankind, in breaking pieces off with great \u0127ammers.\nThis dete\u017ftable pra\u0107tice aro\u017fe from the filly notion ofthe ftones being fa\u0107titious.\nBut, alas! it would be a greater wonder to make them by art, than to carry\nthem 16 miles by art and \u017ftrength ; and tho\u017fe people mu\u017ft be inexcu\u017fable,\nthat deface the monument for fo trifling a fancy, Another argument of vulgar\nincogitancy, is, that all the wonder of the work confi\u017fts, in the difficulty of\ncounting the \u017ftones ; and with that, the infinite numbers of daily vi\u017fitants\nbu\u017fy them\u017felves. This \u017feems to be the remains of \u017fuper\u017ftition, and the notion\nof magic, not yet got out of peoples heads, fince Druid-times. But indeed a\nferious view of this magnificent wonder, is apt to put a thinking and judicious\nper\u017fon into a kind of ecstacy, when he views the \u017ftruggle between art and na\nture, the grandeur of that art that hides it\u017felf, and \u017feems unartful. For tho'\nthe contrivance that put this maffy frame together, mu\u017ft have been exquifite,\nyet the founders endeavour'd to hide it, by the \u017feeming rudene\u017fs of the work.\nThe bulk of the con\u017ftituent parts is fo very great, that the mortai\u017fes and tenons\nmu\u017ft have been prepar'd to an extreme nicety, and, like the fabric of Solo\nmon's temple, every \u017ftone tally'd ; and neither axes nor hammers were heard\nupon the whole \u017ftructure. Neverthele\u017fs there is not a \u017ftone at Stonehenge, that\nfelt not, more or le\u017fs, both ax and hammer of the founders. Yet 'tis highly\nentertaining to confider the judicious carele\u017fne\u017fs therein, really the grand\ngu\u017fto, like a great ma\u017fter in drawing, \u017fecure of the effe\u0107t: a true ma\u017fter-piece.\nEvery thing proper, bold, aftoni\u017fhing, The lights and \u017fhades adapted with\ninconceivable ju\u017ftne\u017fs. Notwith\u017ftanding the monftrous fize of the work, and\nevery part of it; 'tis far from appearing heavy : 'tis compos'd of \u017feveral \u017fpecies\nof work, and the proportions of the diffimilar parts recommend the whole, and\nit plea\u017fes like a magical \u017fpell. No one thinks any part of it too great or too\nlittle, too high or too low. And we that can only view it in its ruins, the le\u017fs\nregret tho\u017fe ruins, that, if po\u017f\u017fible, add to its folemn maje\u017fty.. . -\nThe stones of the gray weathers are of a ba\u017ftard fort of white marble, and\nlie upon the \u017furface of the ground, in infinite numbers, and ofall dimen\u017fions.\nThey are loofe, detach'd from any rock, and doubtle\u017fs lay there ever fince the\ncreation. Being \u017folid parts thrown out to the \u017furface of the fluid globe, when\nC its\n\fJ' 7' 0 N E H E N G E\nits rotation was fir\u017ft impre\u017fs'd. All our Druid temples are built, where the\u017fe\nfort of \u017ftones from the \u017furface can be had at rea\u017fonable di\u017ftances; for they are\nnever taken from quarries. Here is a very good quarry at Chilmark in this\ncountry. Sali\u017fbury cathedral, and all the great buildings are thence; but 'tis\na ftone quite different to our work. It was a matter of much labour to draw\nthem hither, 16 miles. My friend the reverend Dr. Stephen Hales, the excel\nlent author of vegetable \u017ftatics, and other works, computed them as follows.\nThe \u017ftone at the upper end of the cell, which is fallen down and broke in half,\nis in length (fays he) 25 feet, in breadth 7 feet, and in thickne\u017fs at a medium\n3 ;, amounts to 6 12 cubic feet. Now a cubic foot of Hedington ftone weighs\nnear 154# pounds troy. If Stonehenge stone be of the fame \u017fpecific gravity, it\nwill amount to 94,348 pounds, which is 3 1 ; tuns. But if this be of the fame\nfpecific gravity as Burford stone, which weighs to 155 : the cubic foot, then it\nwill weigh 953 19 pounds troy, or 32 tuns, If lt be equal to Blaidon stone,\nwhich is 187 pounds troy per cubic foot, then it weighs I 14444 pounds troy,\nor 38 tuns. But I am fure that the ftone is of con\u017fiderably larger dimen\u017fions,\nthan what Dr. Hales has \u017ftated it at, and that the fort of \u017ftone is much heavier\nthan that of the large\u017ft \u017fpecific gravity he \u017fpeaks of and that it amounts to\nmore than 4o tuns, and requires more than 14o oxen to draw it; yet this is\nnot the heavie\u017ft ftone at the place.\nThe notion we ought to entertain of Stonehenge is not a little enhanc'd, by\nthe di\u017fcovery I made from frequent men\u017furations there. It gave me the op\nportunity of finding out the standard and original mea\u017fure, which the people\nus'd, who made this and all other works of this kind. And this precludes\nany tedious di\u017fputation again\u017ft the opinion of authors; for whoever makes any\neminent building, mo\u017ft certainly forms it upon the common mea\u017fure in u\u017fe,\namong the people of that place. Therefore if the proportions of Stonehenge\nfall into fractions and uncouth numbers, when mea\u017fur\u2019d by the Engli}},\nFrench, Roman, or Grecian foot, we may affuredly conclude, the archite\u0107ts\nwere neither Engli\u017fh, French, Roman or Greeks. Thus, for instance, when\nthe accurate Greaves tells us, the door of the Pantheon (which is of one stone)\nis of Engli\u017fh foot-mea\u017fure 19 foot within : \u017fhould we not be apt to affert\nat fir\u017ft fight, that the archite\u0107t in fo co\u017ftly a work, did not chu\u017fe his mea\u017fures\nat random, but intended that this dimen\u017fion fhould be 2o feet? When we\nconfider this building is at Rome, and that it amounts to 2o Roman feet, mu\u017ft\nwe not conclude, it was ere\u0107ted by the Roman \u017ftandard? adding too, that all\nthe re\u017ft of the dimen\u017fions of this stately stru\u0107ture fall aptly and judiciou\u017fly into\nthe fame fcale. So as long as any vestigia of St. Paul's cathedral remain, the\nEngli\u017fh foot, by which it was built, will ea\u017fily be known. I must prepare the\nreader for a right under\u017ftanding of our Druid edifices, by informing him, that\nStonehenge, and all other works of this nature in our i\u017fland, are erected by that\nmo\u017ft ancient mea\u017fure call'd a cubit, which we read of in the holy \u017fcriptures,\nand in ancient profane authors. I mean the fame individual mea\u017fure, call'd the\nHebrew, Egyptian, Ph\u00e6nician cubit; mo\u017ft probably deriv'd from Noah and\nAdam. \u2019Tis the fame that the pyramids of Egypt and other their works are\nproje\u0107ted upon; the \u017fame as that of Mo\u017fes's tabernacle, Solomon's temple, Gc.\nand we may rea\u017fonably pride our\u017felves in poffesting the\u017fe vi\u017fible monuments of\nthe old mea\u017fure of the world. My predece\u017f\u017for Bi\u017fhop Cumberland \u017fhows, enough\nto fatisfy us, that the Egyptian and Hebrew mea\u017fure was the fame, tho\u2019 he has\nnot hit upon that mea\u017fure, to a nicety. My friend and collegue Dr. Arbuth\nnot has been more \u017fucce\u017fsful, in applying it to \u017fuch parts of the greater pyra\nmid, as evidently e\u017ftabli\u017fh its proportion, to our Engli\u017fh foot, from the mea\nfures Greaves has left us: and \u017fhows it to be 2o inches and # of Engli\u017fh mea\u017fure.\nThusthe Do\u0107tor ob\u017ferves the fide of the greater pyramid at ba\u017fe, is 693 Engli\/5\nfeet; which amounts exa\u0107tly to 4oo Egyptian cubits, a full and fuitable num\nber for fuch a \u017fquare work, and without que\u017ftion the originally defign'd mea\nfure,\n\f\u2022\nR\nS\n|}|i|\n|\n|\nS\n\u00a7\n|\u0160\u012f\u0160N-NN\n|S\n\u00a7NN\u00a7\n|Y\nR\nN\n\u00d1\n\u00d1\n\\NNS? \/\n| \u00a7\nN \u00d1 -\nUA \u00a7N \/ \/\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|| ||\n|\n|| ||||||\n|||||||\n|\n||||||||||||\n||\nre tam\n|\n|\n-- \u00b7\n|\n|\n|.| | | | | | | | | , '\n||| ||\n| ' ||\n|\n| | \" |\n-\n| | | || ||\nt* | | || | | - |- | || || ||\n' , ||||||||||||||||||\n|\n| | | |\n\f\fD E s c R I B E D.\nfure, the stadium of old. I have taken notice that Inigo fones ob\u017ferv'd the like\ndimen\u017fions, in laying out the plot of Lincoln's-Inn-fields. The Do\u0107tor adds\nmany more in\u017ftances, deduc'd in the fame way, to confirm it. I add, that\nGreaves fays, the lowermo\u017ft \u017fteps of the pyramid are near 4 feet in height,\nwhich amounts to 2 cubits and 2 palms. They are 3 foot in breadth, i. e.\n1 cubit 4 palms. The length of the declining fir\u017ft entrance is 92 feet and an\nhalf, i. e. 55 cubits. The length of the next gallery is 1 Io feet, which a\nmounts to 6o cubits. There is another gallery in the pyramid, of the fame\nlength. Mr. Webb fays the diameter of Stonehenge is 1 Io feet. This would\ntempt one to \u017fu\u017fpe\u0107t the fame mea\u017fure us'd in both. Thus the diameter of the\nlike work at Rowldrich in Oxford\u017fhire, de\u017fcrib\u2019d by Dr. Plot, is 35 yards, i. e.\n1 Io feet, gro\u017fsly mea\u017fur'd. Father Brothais in his ob\u017fervations on upper E\ngypt, in our Phil. Tran\u017f found a door-cafe made of one ftone, in a magnificent\nbuilding, it was 26 ; feet in height, this is 15 cubits. Dr. Huntington, in the\nfame Tran\/ fays, he found the \u017fphynx \u017ftanding by the northern pyramids to be\n1 Io feet in circuit, i. e. 6o cubits. , Ptolony in his IVth book, and Pliny\nXXXVI. fpeak of the obeli\u017fk rais'd by king Ramests at Heliopolis, which\nMr. Webb, p. 34. gives the length of in Engli\u017fh feet, 136. This is 8o cu\nbits. That which Augustus fet up in the circus maximus at Rome upon re\ndu\u0107tion of Egypt, Webb fays, is 12o feet 9 inches, which amounts to 7o cubits.\nAnother, Augustus fet up in the campus martius, which he fays is 9 foot higher,\ni. e. 5 cubits. He \u017fpeaks again of that ere\u0107ted by Fontana before St. Peter's,\n8 1 feet, which was 5o cubits. I \u017fuppo\u017fe the bafe being injur'd, it was cut a\nlittle \u017fhorter. This at the ba\u017fe, he fays, is 9 foot fquare, i. e. 5 cubits. The\nVatican obeli\u017fk is 17o foot high, which is ioo cubits. 12 foot broad at bot\ntom, which is 7 cubits; at top a third part le\u017fs.\nHence we gather, the mea\u017fure of the \u017fhew-bread table of the Yews, a cubit\nand half in height, Exod. xxv. 23. It had a golden crown about it, meaning\na moulding, or verge or corni\u017fh, as upon our tea-tables. ni peripheria, coro\nna, becau\u017fe 12 loaves were to be pil'd upon it.

Rode hengenne is in Saxon a hang\ning\n\f8 S 7 0 N E H E N G E\ning-rod or pole, i. e. a gallows; and Stonehengeisa \u017ftonegallows, called fo from\nthe hanging parts, architraves, or rather impo\u017fts, the more remarkable part;\nand which only can per\u017fuade people from thinking, the \u017ftones grew in the very\nplace, (as they expre\u017fs it.) And fo Mr. Camden, Dr. Holland, Mr. Webb and\nothers think, of the wonderful work at Abury; becau\u017fe there are none of\nthe\u017fe overthwart ftones, as here. Many are fo aftoni\u017fhed at the bulk of the\u017fe\nftones, that mea\u017furing all art and power by their own, they had rather think,\nthey \u017fprouted up in their places, like mu\u017fhrooms, at regular di\u017ftances, in ma\nthematical circles; than that they were plac'd there by human indu\u017ftry, for ex\ncellent purpo\u017fe. But pendulous rocks are now called henges in York\u017fhire, and\nI have been informed of another place there called Stonehenge, being natural\nrocks. So that I doubt not, Stonehenge in Saxon fignifies the hanging ftones.\nIn Cornwallis a Heath call'd now Hengston down, probably from fuch a work as\nours, now demoli\u017fhed. It is in the hundred of Easte. And near it, is that\nother memorable Antiquity, compo\u017fed of many upright ftones, call'd the Hur\nlers, a Druid temple. The old Britons or Wel\u017fh call Stonehenge choir gaur,\nwhich fome interpret chorea gigantum, the giants dance: Ijudge, more rightly\nchorus magnus, the great choir, round church, or temple. As Banchor (where\nprobably was of old, another Druid temple) means the high temple. But they\nmi\u017ftake it for chorea, chwarae xuare, a ball, dance; as Necham fings;\nNobilis est lapidum stru\u010diura, chorea gigantum :\nArs experta fuum paff\u00e8, peregit opus.\nMr. Camden defines the work coron\u00e6 in modum. The Latin corona a crown,\ncorolla a ghirland, and the Briti\u017fh crown comes from its circular form, as c\u00f3r\nchorus. The armoric Britons call cryn rotundus, kruin the Iri\u017fh. Coryn is\nthe round tip of any thing, many fuch like words in all the Celtic diale\u0107ts.\nThe chorus of a building among Roman chri\u017ftians, became appropriate to the\nmore \u017facred part, or ea\u017ft end of churches, always turn'd of a circular form ;\nfrom the time of Constantine the Great. Thus all the churches in the holy\nland, thus the chapel in Colchester ca\u017ftle, and in the Tower of London, (both, .\nin my opinion, built about his time) are round at the ea\u017ft end. The old Bri\ntons or Wel\u017fh, we find, hada notion of its being a \u017facred place, tho' they were\nnot the builders of it; for I take them to be the remains of the Celtic people\nthat came from the continent, who chiefly inhabited England, at leaft the\nfouth part, when the Romans invaded the i\u017fland, they are more particularly\ntheremains of the Belgae. I \u017fuppo\u017fe theirname Wel\u017fh, a corruption of Belg\u00e6,\n'Ov\u00e9?)zi in greek, Belg\u00edfchen and Belfchen in german. Strabo IV. \u017fpeaks\nof their way of making flannel, called Aaway, for which our Wel\u017fh are fo fa\nmous. Strabo gives the celtic word without the guttural a\u017fpirate, chlena in la\ntin. The mo\u017ft ancient inhabitants, the remains of the old Phaenician colon\nand primitive Celts who built Stonehenge, were the Pi\u010dis, Scots, Highland and\nIri\u017fh, all the \u017fame people, tho' perhaps differing \u017fomewhat in diale\u0107t, as in fi\ntuation: no otherwi\u017fe than a Cumberland-man and one of Somer\/et\/ire now.\nThe Corni\u017fh, I \u017fuppo\u017fe, \u017fome remains too, of the old oriental race. But at\nthis very day in Wales, they callevery antiquated appearance beyond memory,\nIri\u017fh. Upon view of land, that from before any ones remembrance appears\nto have been plow'd, or very ancient ruins of buildings, and the like, the\nimmediately pronounce, That it was in the times of the Iri\u017fh.

They call old foun\ndations, Pights hou\u017fes, &c. Every thing is Pi\u010dti\/h, who\u017fe origin they do not\nknow.

For the Belgae could not be ignorant\nof their own coming from the Gallic continent. -\nI have taken notice of another remarkable particular, as to the name of\nStonehenge; which I apprehend to be of highe\u017ft antiquity: that it was call\ned the Ambres, or Ambro\u017f\u00eb, as the famous main Ambre by Pen\/\u00e4ns in Corn\nwall, another work of the Druids akin to this. And from hence the adjacent\ntown of Ambre\/bury had its name. But of this matter, I mu\u017ft beg the readers\npatience, till I come to the la\u017ft chapter, and di\u017fcour\u017fe of the antiquity of the\u017fe\nworks in general. - -\nSo much at pre\u017fentas to the name of our fabrick; it is time to draw toward\nthe \u017facred pile, and fancy our\u017felves walking upon this delightful plain:\njuvat arva videre -\nNon rastris hominum, non ulli obnoxia curae. Virg.\nnought can be \u017fweeter than the air that moves o\u2019re this hard and dry, chalky\nfoil. Every \u017ftep you take upon the \u017fmooth carpet, (literally) your nofe is fa\nluted with the mo\u017ft fragrant \u017fmell of \/\u1ec3rpillum, and apium, which with the\nfhort grafs continually cropt by the flocks of \u017fheep, compo\u017fes the fofte\u017ft and\nmo\u017ft verdant turf, extremely ea\u017fy to walk on, and which ri\u017fes as with a \u017fpring,\nunder ones feet. The following drawing TAB. III. is a pro\u017fpe\u0107t taken from TA B. III.\nthe king's barrow, we\u017ft from We\/pastan's camp, in the way from Ambre\/bury to\nStonehenge, by the Bristol road. Tho' the graver has not done it ju\u017ftice: yet it\nwill give one a general notion of the fituation of the place. It is admirably\nchofen, being in the mid\u017ft of tho\u017fe wide downs, eall'd Sali\u017fbury plain; between\nthe river Avon to the ea\u017ft, and a brook that runs into the Willy, on the we\u017ft.\nThe\u017fe two \u017ftreams half round encompa\u017fs it, at 2 miles di\u017ftance, forming as it\nwere a circular area, of 4 or 5 miles diameter, compos'd of gentle acclivities\nand declivities, open and airy. Yet agreeably diver\u017fify'd with the appearance of\nbarrows, every where upon the edges of the highe\u017ft grounds. Which very bar\nrows are curious and entertaining, when view'd at hand, as well for the nicety\nand hand\u017fome turn of theirforms, as for their great variety, and all within fight of\nthe temple. The\u017fe downsfeed many flocks of\u017fheep, and no doubt furni\u017fh'd the\nidea of Theffalian and Arcadian plains, to the noble Sydney refidingat the neigh\nbouring Wilton. The rivers are planted very thick with towns. Six miles fouth\nof Stonehenge is Sali\u017fbury, a mile nearer is Sorbiodunum, or old Sarum, by the\nfide of which paffes the Roman road via Iceniana reaching from Norfolk, into\nDorf\u00eat\u017fhire. As this road goes \u017fouthward, a mile beyond Woodyates, where it\nenters Dor\u017fet\u017fhire and Cranburn cha\u017fe, it pa\u017fies over a heath where are many\nold barrows, like the\u017fe on Sali\u017fbury plain. It happens there, to infringe upon\none of the barrows, which luckily affords us a demon\u017ftration, of the road be\ning made fince tho\u017febarrows; of which I took notice in my itinerarium p. 18o.\nand further to gratify the curious have here inferted a print of it TA B. IV. TA B. IV.\nand may take the opportunity once for all to advertize them, of the di\u017fadvan\ntage under which all drawings from the\u017fe plains mu\u017ft appear. They are made\nfor ufe and in\u017ftru\u0107tion, like mathematical figures, and cannotbe expe\u0107ted much\nto plea\u017fe the eye; being form\u2019d chiefly from bare lines, admitting no pi\u0107ture\nlike decoration.\nD I have\n\fI O J' 7' 0 N E H E N G E\nTA B. IV.\nI have ob\u017ferv'd another fimilar proof of the\u017fe works being older than the\nRoman times here, in that Roman road that goes from Marlborough to Bath.\nIt is near Abury, and I have a print of it engrav'd, which will be exhibited,\nwhen I next publi\u017fh an account of that great work. But in the former plate\nIV. I call tho\u017fe Druid barrows, which are often found on the\u017fe plains: a cir\ncular trench, fometime of 1oo foot diameter, with only a \u017fmall tump of earth\nin the middle, under which there is commonly an urn. Sometime two or\nthree of the\u017fe little tumps or diminutive tumuli within one circle, which it is\nnatural to \u017fuppo\u017fe, were friends or relations. The\u017fe circles are always excel\nlently well mark'd out. -\nThe particular \u017fpot of ground where Stonehenge stands, is in the lord\u017fhip of\nwe\u017ft or little Ambre\/bury: the poffestion of the reverend Mr. Hayward, who\nat pre\u017fent may be call'd the Archdruid of the i\u017fland. \"Tis a delicate part of\nthis large plain, with a gentle declivity from the \u017fouth-we\u017ft to the \u017fouth and\nnorth-ea\u017ft. So that the foil, which is chalk, is perfe\u0107tly dry and hard. Hence\nthe infinite numbers of coaches and hor\u017fes, that thro\u2019 fo many centuries have\nbeen vifiting the place every day, have not obliterated the track of the banks\nand ditches. The water cannot po\u017f\u017fibly re\u017ft any where hereabouts. The\nfounders con\u017fulted well for the \u017ftability of their work, and falubrity of the\nplace. Ce\u017far informs us in his commentaries, B. G. vI. 13. that among the\nDruids, \u201cone has the \u017fupreme authority. When he is dead, whoever excels\n\u201c in dignity \u017fucceeds. But if there be more candidates, the Archdruid is cho\u017fe\n\u201c by the votes of the Druids: and \u017fometimes they fight for it. At a certain\n\u201c fix\u2019d time of the year the Gauli\u017fh Druids meet, in the territories of the Car\n\u201c nutes, which country is in the middle of Gaul, in a con\u017f\u00e9cratedplace. Hi\n\u201c ther all per\u017fons from all quarters come, who have any controverfy, and stand\n\u201c to their determination. The di\u017fcipline of the Druids aro\u017fe in Britain, and\n\u201c is \u017faid from thence to have been brought into Gaul. And now, they who\n\u201c defign to be more throughly initiated therein, go over to learn.\u201d Here in\nfew lines the great author acquaints us with a va\u017ft fund of ancient hi\u017ftory, and\nupon which whole volumes have been wrote. I ob\u017ferve no more from it at\nre\u017fent, than that we may very rea\u017fonably conclude, the elegant and the mag\nnificent \u017ftru\u0107ture of Stonehenge was as the metropolitical church of the chief\nDruid of Britain. This was the locus con\u017f\u00e9cratus where they met at fome great\nfe\u017ftivals in the year, as well to perform the extraordinary \u017facrifices and religi\nous rites, as to determine cau\u017fes and civil matters. Ce\u017far calls the\u017fe appoint\nments of the Druids in Gaul con\u017fecrated places, where probably was nothing\nbut a circle of rude \u017ftones. Had he feen tho\u017fe of our i\u017fland, an Abury or even\na Stonehenge, he would \u017fcarce have given them the title of temples: he was not\nu\u017fed to the old patriarchal way. But I reckon the true reading in that pa\u017f\u017fage\nquoted from him, to be loco con\u017f\u00e9crato, not luco, which was put in by fome\nbold tran\u017fcriber, who had heard of the fondne\u017fs of the Druids for groves. But\nhow unfit is a grove for a great and public meeting upon civil affairs? And this\nfor the excellency of its fituation upon a va\u017ft plain, was well calculated for a\npublick meeting of tho\u017fe of the order, at an ele\u0107tion of a new Archdruid. As\nCe\u017far's words give light to the work before us, \u017fo it confirms what the warlike\nauthor \u017fays, of the di\u017fcipline being originally in Britain; which the critics up\non the continent cannot bear, and vainly endeavour to \u017fpirit away Ce\u017far's\nmeaning. The very building of Stonehenge, to \u017fay nothing of other like works\nhere, \u017fhows it was not in vain, that the youth of Gaul came to learn of men,\nwho could contrive and execute fo mighty a work.\nStonehenge \u017ftands not upon the very \u017fummit of a hill, but pretty near it, and\nfor more than three quarters of the circuit you a\u017fcend to it very gently from\nlower ground. At halfa mile di\u017ftance, the appearance of it is \u017ftately and aw\nful, really augu\u017ft. As you advance nearer, e\u017fpecially up the avenue, which is\nto the north-ea\u017ft of it, (which fide is now mo\u017ft perfe\u0107t) the greatne\u017fs of its con\ntOllr\n\fP\/a.\nEngli\u017fh . |Engli\u017fh . |Engli\u017fh . |Engli\u017fh |\nFeet Cnbits Feet Cnbits Feet Cnbits Feet Cnbits | TAB.VI.\nI H \/ | |\n|\n|\nH |- |2 H \/ | H \/00\n|+ \/ | 3 | \/o\nH 2 H \/(70\nH 4 | | 2oo\n\/\n|-\nH \/0\nH 2 5 H 3 |- O\n| | 6 | 2 H 300 |\n| 7 H 4 H 200\nH 3 H 8 |3o H 400\nH.5\nH 2 |- 42\nH \/O H \u00d3 | 2o H.500\nH 4 | H 300\n462\n| | | 7 | 6oo\n| 5\nH 3 H 8 | 50 | 700 H 400\nH \/5 H 2 H30\nH 6\u2019 -\n| 800\n|- H \u00d3 0 1\n| H \/O | |500\n| | | 900\nL 4 |\n? | \/\/\n-\n| H 462 |\n| H2O | 7o H \/O00 ||\n8 H \/ 2 H 6oo\n| | \/\/00\nH 5 | 80 |\n|- H \/200\n92 |- H.50 | 7oo\nH 25- H (762\nH \/ 5 32 H \/300\nH \/O\n| 6\u2019 H\nH \/00 H\/zoo || 800\nH \/\/ H H6O\nH30 H \/ 500\nH \/\/o | 900\nH \/2 | 7 H H\/600\nH |\n\/262 || | 700\n|- 7o\n\f\fD E s c R I B E D. 1 IV\ntour fills the eye in an a\u017ftoni\u017fhing manner. TAB. V. is the front pro\u017fpe\u0107t from TA B. v.\nthe entrance of the avenue. The ftone that leans o'er the high altar appears\nthro' the grand or principal entrance: becau\u017fe we \u017ftand upon lower ground. If\nthe reader plea\u017fes to ca\u017ft his eye upon Plate XII. there 'tis repre\u017fented in ortho- TA B. XII.\ngraphy, (to \u017fpeak technically) as here in pro\u017fpe\u0107t. Hence by this method of\ncomparing the de\u017figns together, we may, without confufion, gather a true no\ntion of the work. Stonehenge is a good deal more in diameter, than the out\nfide of St. Paul's cupola. And from a compari\u017fon of the\u017fe two buildings, I was\nable to judge of the vanity of the archite\u0107t of St. Peter's at Rome, who in or\nder to degrade the Pantheon, (whil\u017ft he was imitating it) boa\u017fted, he would\nfet the Pantheon 2oo foot high in the air, meaning the cupola there. But the\narchite\u0107t of the Pantheon, Valerius Ostien\u017fis (had he been alive) would have told\nhim, that the vaftne\u017fs of the diameter in the\u017fe cupola's is loft by the very height.\nWhatever we would have admired, ought to be pre\u017ferved as the large\u017ft dimen\nfion. Therefore Valerius, with admirable judgment, has made the outward\nbreadth of the Pantheon one fifth part compleatly longer than its height, taken\nin front; but if we mea\u017fure it fidewife, taking in the portico, the breadth to\nthe height, is more than 6 to 4. By this means the wonder of the Panthecn, .\nthe curve or arch 15o Roman feet in diameter, remains. So the curve of Stone\nhenge, which is above 1oo Engli\u017fh feet, appears extraordinary large and well\nproportion'd, upon a height of 18 foot, which reaches to the top of the outer\ncorni\u017fh; that of the inner corni\u017fhes is but 24 foot high, at a medium. For\nthe corni\u017fhes of the inner part of Stonehenge, or that which Webb calls the cell,\nare not all of equal height, of which in proper place. Thus both parts of the\nwonder is pre\u017ferv'd, the greatne\u017fs of the circuit of the whole work, the great\nne\u017fs and height of the parts that compo\u017fe it; the height being one fourth of the\ndiameter. The greatne\u017fs too of the lights and \u017fhades in Stonehenge, as well as\ntheir variety arifing from a circular form, gives it all po\u017f\u017fible advantage, and\nmakes it de\u017ferve the appellation of,\nDeorum glorio\u017fa domus,\nas Theocritus and Herodotus generally call temples. And its fituation is corre\nfpondent to the antient notion. . Pau\u017f\u00e0nias prai\u017fes the Tanagrei in Beotia, for\nhaving their temples in clean and di\u017ftin\u00e9t area's, di\u017ftant from profane buildings\nand traffic.\nStonehenge is inclo\u017fed within a circular ditch. After one has pa\u017fs'd this ditch,\nfays the right reverend annotator to Camden, he a\u017fcends 35 yards before he\ncomes at the work it\u017felf. This mea\u017fure is the fame, as that which Webb calls\nI 1o foot, the diameter of the work. For the area inclos'd by a ditch, wherein\nStonehenge is fituate, is in diameter three times the diameter of Stonehenge.\nSee the Plate of the area. XXIII. Therefore the distance between the verge Tan.\nof the ditch within fide, quite round, to the work of the Temple, is equal to XXIII.\nthe diameter of the Temple. . The reader remembers what I promis'd, about\nthe \u017fcale or mea\u017fure whereby this work and all others of the Druids, is form\u2019d;\nthat 'tis the old Hebrew, Ph\u00e6nician or Egyptian Cubit, which compar'd with\nthe Engli\u017fh foot, amounts to 2o inches and #. Therefore I have drawn the\nen\u017fuing comparifon and proportion, between our Engli\u017fh and Hebrew Scale ;\nwhich is to accompany us in the future de\u017fcription. TAB.

Tho\u017fe \u017ftones that \u017ftand, are luxated\nvarious ways, by time and their own weight; by filly people digging about\nthem, and by the unfortunate colony of rabbets lately tran\u017flated thither. So\nthat we may well fay with Claudian,\nSeram ponderibus pronis tra\u010diura ruinam,\nPars cadit affiduo fatu, pars imbre pere\u017fa\nRumpitur, abripuit partem vitio\u017fa vetustas. -\nI was forc'd to make many admea\u017furements and repeated, before I could ob\ntain an exa\u0107t ground-plot; and it requir'd much confideration to do it, and to\nfind out the true \u017fcale by which it was compos'd, the Druid cubit, which they\nbrought with them from the ea\u017ft. Therefore by the annexed \u017fcales, TAB. VI.\nwhich I have contriv'd to an\u017fwer all lengths, the reader will mo\u017ft perfe\u0107tly un\nder\u017ftand the \u017fub\u017fequent de\u017fcription, and fee the truth of my affertion: and may\nfrom thence be enabled to mea\u017fure any other like works, in our iflands, which\nI have not had the opportunity of viewing. It was the ea\u017ftern way, in laying\nout a building, to u\u017fe a \u017ftaff of 6 cubits long. This was of a convenient, ma\nnageable length; and its divi\u017fions being half a dozen, fuited well a reckoning\nby duodenaries. Thus in Ezek. xl. 3, 5. Apoc. xxi. 16. the angel that laid out\nthe temple of Solomon, is de\u017fcribed, as having a reed of 6 cubits (a mea\u017furing\nreed or cane) in his hand. This being the univer\u017fal and fir\u017ft mea\u017fure of an\ntiquity, was in time \u017fpread all over the world. In particular, it became the\nTA B. VII.\nTA B. VIII.\nTA B. IX.\nTA B, X,\ndecempedum of the Greeks and Romans; the common mea\u017furing \u017ftandard. But\n'tis remarkable, they alter'd the divi\u017fions, thinking it more artful and conveni\nent to have them in le\u017fs parts: and in\u017ftead of 6 cubits, they made it confi\u017ft of\nIo feet. .. And by time and change, the whole mea\u017fure became fomewhat al\nter'd from the primitive. For the Greek decempedum was \u017fwell'd fomewhat too\nlong, as the Romans dimini\u017fh'd theirs a little. Ezekiel's reed is our Io foot\nand 4 inches ; ; 4oo cubits is the stadium of the ancients, or furlong, 7oo feet.\nWhen you enter the building, whether on foot or horfeback and ca\u017ft your\neyes around, upon the yawning ruins, you are \u017ftruck into an ex\u017ftatic reverie,\nwhich none can de\u017fcribe, and they only can be \u017fenfible of, that feel it. Other\nbuildings fall by piece meal, but here a fingle ftone is a ruin, and lies like the\nhaughty carca\u017fe of Goliath. Yet there is as much of it undemoli\u017fhed, as en\nables us \u017fufficiently to recover its form, when it was in its mo\u017ft perfe\u0107t state.\nThere is enough of every part to pre\u017ferve the idea of the whole. The next\nPlate, TAB. VII. the peep (as I call it) into the fan\u010dium fan\u1ebfForum, is drawn,\nat the very entrance, and as a view into theinfide.

The rea\nfon why Stonehenge was not fet near a river, has hitherto effectually pre\u017ferv'd it,\nthis part being uninhabitable upon that account, and rather too far off a town\nfor tillage. But when I curiou\u017fly contemplated the beauty and convenience of\nthis court, I ob\u017ferv'd two remarkable places, which plainly have a conformity\nwith the two \u017ftones fet upon the vallum ; which \u017ftones puzzle all enquirers.\nThe\u017fe particulars \u017feem to explain one another, and more e\u017fpecially by the help\nof a coin in Vaillant, tom. II. p. 24.o. for which rea\u017fon I caus'd it to be engra\nven on that plate, TAB. XXIII. the area of Stonehenge. \u2019Tis a coin of Philip\nthe Roman emperor, ftruck by the city of Heliopolis in C\u00e6le\/yria under mount\nLibanus, now call'd Baldec, where is an admirable ancient temple remaining,\nde\u017fcrib\u2019d and pi\u0107tur'd in Maundrel's travels of the holy land. In the walls of\nit are two or three ftones of an immen\u017fe length, which feem to be the frag\nments of an obeli\u017fk, dedicated to the fun, whence the name of Heliopolis. The\ncoin pre\u017fents a temple built upon a rock: to which they a\u017fcend by \u017fteps. The\ntemple is inclos'd in an area with a wall. On the left hand by the circuit of the\narea is a \u017ftone altar. A little further, is a great vafe for water to be us'd in the\nfacrifices. The legend is colonia IvLia AvGusta FELix. HELiopolitana. Now\nthe two cavities in the circuit of our area, very probably were the places where\ntwo great \u017ftone vafes were fet, and the two ftones were two altars for \u017fome par\nticular rites, which we don't take upon our\u017felves to explain. See another coin\nII. in Destamp's f\u00e9le\u1ebffiora numifinata, p. 23. which is to the fame purpo\u017fe.\nTho\u017fe \u017ftones are fet in their proper places in my \u017fcheme of the area of Stone\nbenge: and I leave them to the better conje\u0107tures ofthe learned in the\u017fe matters.\nMr. Webb fancies them the jambs of two portals of two entrances, befides the\ngreat entrance; and makes them favour his imaginary triangles, from which\nhe forms the work of Stonehenge, upon a Witruvian plan. And in order to\nbring this about, he draws one \u017ftone, that toward the ea\u017ft, or on the left hand,\nfrom the true and only entrance, no le\u017fs than 12o foot out of its real place.\nNo doubt, the reader will be \u017furpriz'd at this, and the eafier credit me, when\nI \u017fay his ground-plot in other parts, is very far from being exa\u0107t. The reader\nwill ob\u017ferve from my \u017fcheme, that the two femicircular hollows mark'd AA,\nwherein I \u017fuppo\u017fe the water-vafes were fet, are plac'd alternatively, with the\ntwo stones: I don't pretend to \u017fhow why the Druids did fo. But that stone\nstanding, together with the upper A, and the center of the grand entrance by\nthe \u017ftone that lies flat there, make an exa\u0107t equilateral triangle; yet really have\nnot the leaft relation to the \u017fcheme of the work of Stonehenge in general, or to\nthe cell in particular. Nor do the \u017ftones, or tho\u017fe hollows, point out any\nother entrance cro\u017fs the ditch into the area. So in the tabernacle of Mol\u00eas and\ntemple of Solomon, great vafes in bra\u017fs were fet for water, in the court before the\ntemple. - ,\nC H A P.\n\f|\n\u00ab\n|\n|\nS|\n\f\\\n\fD E s c R I B E D.\nC H A P.

Thus have we the original mea\u017fure of the founders of Stone\nhenge. We will take Mr. Webb's mea\u017fures, and compare 'em herewith. TA B.\nXI. the ground-plot.\nMr. Webb fays, p. 55. that the whole work of Stonehenge being of a circu\nlar form, is I Io foot in diameter. But to be precife, 'tis Io8 and fomewhat\nmore, and his own fcale in his ground-plot \u017fhows the fame. This is the dia\nmeter from outfide to outfide, which in our ground-plot is the principal diame\nter. The thickne\u017fs of the ftones of the outward circle, he \u017fays, p. 59. are 3\nfoot and an half. Hence the inner diameter becomes almo\u017ft 1o2 feet Engli\u017fh.\nIf the reader plea\u017fes to mea\u017fure Io2 feet upon the comparative fcales, which I\ngave of the Engli\u017fh foot and Hebrew cubit, being the mea\u017fure us'd by the Dru\nids, or in the fcales at the bottom of the ground-plot, he will find that it a\nmounts exa\u0107tly to 6o cubits. 3o cubits being the radius wherewith they struck\nthe circle upon the turf, which is the inner circumference of that work. That\nfufficiently defin'd their ground-plot. For tho' they intended in general, that\nthe thickne\u017fs of the ftones of this outer circle \u017fhould be 3 foot and a half; but\nto \u017fpeak more properly, 2 cubits (which is the fame mea\u017fure) yet they were\nmore careful of one fide only, of that dimen\u017fion. And the chief bufine\u017fs be\ning withinfide this temple, they fet the be\u017ft face of the ftones inwards, upon\nthat ground-line; the other face was fuited as well as the \u017fcantlings they could\nget, be\u017ft an\u017fwer'd. Webb's 3 foot and a half is preci\u017fely 3 foot 5 inches, and\nfomewhat more, making compleatly 2 Druid cubits, as you find by the \u017fcales.\nThey that carefully view Stonehenge, will ea\u017fily fee, that the ftones of the in\nfide both of the outward circle and of the cell, are the \u017fmootheft, be\u017ft wrought,\nand have the handfome\u017ft appearance. For \u017fo the polite archite\u0107ts of the ea\u017ftern\npart of the world, be\u017ftow'd more elegance within their temples than without,\nNot as our modern London builders, who carve every moulding, and crowd eve\nry ornament, which they borrow out of books, on the outfide of our publick\nftru\u0107tures, that they may more commodiou\u017fly gather the duft and \u017fmoke.\nThe truth is, good fenfe and ob\u017fervation of nature, produces the fame ideas in\nall ages and all nations. Our Druids ob\u017ferv'd, that God almighty in forming\nthe body of a man, made all the external parts great, bold, round, with orna\nment fufficient; but where the beauty chiefly confifted in the fitne\u017fs of the pro\nportions, in \u017fymmetry and plainne\u017fs. In the infide, he has di\u017fplay'd all the\nzninutiae of divine \u017fkill. They have done the like, according to their way, in\nStonehenge. So even as to the outward appearance, I find they took care to fet\nthofe ftones that had the be\u017ft outward face, toward the front or entrance. And\nto embarra\u017fs the general \u017fcheme of the work, they made u\u017fe of two centers in\nftead of one, but 2 cubits di\u017ftance from one another; perhaps to make the thing\nintricate and as magical: befides the advantage it gives to the oval form of the\nTA B. XI.\nincluded cell.\nOb\u017ferve,\nTA B. VI.\n\fI 6 S 7 0 N E H E N G E\nTA B. XII.\nTA B. V.\nOb\u017ferve, in laying down the ground-plot and proje\u0107ting this outer circle,\nwe faid it was 1 Io feet, (gro\u017fs mea\u017fure) in diameter. We remember what is\nbefore-mention'd, that the learned Greaves mea\u017fur\u2019d two galleries in the great\ner pyramid, in like manner, each I Io feet. So the bi\u017fhop of London fays,\nfrom the grand entrance of Stonehenge, to the work is 35 yards: fo he fays the\ndiameter of the circle at Rowldrich in Oxford\/hire, is 35 yards: all this while 6o\nDruid or Egyptian cubits are meant. So the length of Solomon's temple was 6o\ncubits, whereof the \u00c6des 4o cubits, the fan\u010dium fan\u010diorum 2o. -\nThe intention of the founders of Stonehenge was this. The whole circle\nwas to confift of 3o ftones, each \u017ftone was to be 4 cubits broad, each interval\n2 cubits. 3o times 4 cubitsis twice 6o: 3o times 2 cubits is 6o. So that thrice\n6o cubits compleats a circle who\u017fe diameter is 6o. A ftone being 4 cubits\nbroad, and 2 cubits thick is double the interval, which is a \u017fquare of 2 cubits.\nChange the places between the ftones and their intervals, and it will make a\ngood ground-plot for a circular portico of Greek or Roman work. For \u017fuppo\nfing the\u017fe intervals to be \u017fquare plinths of 2 cubits each fide, and columns pro\nperly fet upon them: it will admit of 3 diameters for the intercolumniation,\nwhich is the dia\u017ftyle manner in archite\u0107ture. . But to talk of pycnostyle with\nMr. Webb, and call the\u017fe \u017ftones of ours pillars or pillafters, where they are\ntwice as broad as the \u017fpace between them, and to call this an order, is\nmonftrous.\nThus a \u017ftone and an interval in this outward circle of Stonehenge, makes\nfquares; 2 allotted to the ftone, 1 to the interval; which for \u017ftability and beau\nty withal, in \u017fuch a work as ours, is a good proportion. The curiofity of the\nwork, and the general orthography of the outward circle, I have de\u017fign'd in\nPlate XII. and it may be feen in the feven \u017ftones now remaining at the grand\nentrance. Which \u017fhow what \u017ftri\u0107tly was the intent of the founders, and where\nthey took the liberty to relax of that \u017ftri\u0107tne\u017fs, and that with judgment; \u017fo\nas to produce a good effe\u0107t. I \u017fhall explain it from Mr. Webb's own mea\u017fures,\nthat I may give the truth its full advantage. P. 59. he fays, the ftones which\nmade the outward circle are 7 foot in breadth. Ob\u017ferve that 7 foot makes 4\ncubits of the Druids. He \u017fays, they are 15 foot and a half high. You find\nthat exa\u0107tly 9 cubits. P. 61. he fays, the architraves lying round about upon\nthem, are 2 foot and a halfhigh, i. e. our cubit and half. He mentions their\nbreadth to be 3 foot and half, equal to the thickne\u017fs of the upright, i. e. our two\ncubits. They are jointed in the middle of each perpendicular \u017ftone. Hence\ntho\u2019 he has not mention'd the length of the\u017fe architraves, we gather them to be\n6 cubits long. This is \u017fpoke of their inward length, for outwardly they mu\u017ft\nneeds be fomewhat longer, as being an ark of a larger circle. I mu\u017ft ob\u017ferve :\nabout the\u017fe architraves, as Mr. Webb calls them, that they are more properly\ncall'd impo\u017fts or corni\u017fhes; for they are not made to \u017fupport any thing above\nthem, as is the nature of an architrave, but for the \u017ftability and ornament of\nwhat \u017fupports them, which is the nature of impo\u017fts and corni\u017fhes. Tho' the\u017fe\nbodies of \u017ftone here, never had or were intended to have, any mouldingsupon\nthem, like Greek and Roman works; they are wrought perfectly plain, and\nfuitable to the \u017ftones that \u017fupport them. I ob\u017ferve further, the chizeling of\nour upright ftones, is only above ground. For the 4 or 5 foot in length below\nground, is left in theoriginal natural form. And that the upright ftones are made\nvery judiciou\u017fly to dimini\u017fh a little, every way; fo that at top they are but 3\ncubits and a halfbroad, and fo much narrower as to \u017fuffer their imposts, to\nhang over a little, or proje\u0107t (in properer terms) over the heads of the up\nrights, both within fide and without. By this means the\u017fe uprights are in\nmuch le\u017fs danger of falling or \u017fwerving any way: and the imposts, which\nare not broader than the thickne\u017fs of the \u017ftones at bottom, which \u017fupport them,\nhave a graceful effe\u0107t, by projecting a little, without danger of furcharging\nthem.

The Druids had, from patriarchal times, made\ntheir altars or temples of rude unpoli\u017fh'd \u017ftones. But now hearing, probably\nfrom Ph\u00e6nician traders, of the glories of Solomon's temple, at lea\u017ft of other\ntemples made artfully in imitation of it; \u017fuch as tho\u017fe of Sestris in Egypt, and\nothers about Ph\u00e6nicia : they thus made a \u017fmall approach to \u017fquare \u017fcantlings\nand \u017ftones wrought. And this \u017feems to have been the fir\u017ft and the la\u017ft work\nof theirs of this kind, that I can hear of, either in the Britanic i\u017fles, or on the\ncontinent. And no doubt but it mu\u017ft give them fo high a reputation, that\neven the people of Gaul them\u017felves could not help owning to C\u00e6\u017far, that the\ndi\u017fcipline of the\u017fe men was fir\u017ft begun here, and carry'd on with \u017fuch \u017fucce\u017fs,\nthat they fent their youth from the continent hither, as to an academy, to be\ninitiated in their learning. We are not to \u017fuppo\u017fe the\u017fe words are to be \u017ftri\u0107tly\ntaken, as if the Druids here began their in\u017ftitution : but that being an oriental\nmanner of religion, and much different from that on the Gallic continent, what\nthey had of it there, was deriv'd from Britain. It appear'd as much new to\nthem, who were chiefly idolaters, as in many ages preceding, Abraham's reli\ngion appear'd new to the inhabitants of Ph\u00e6nicia and Egypt : who were then\nnot much tin\u0107tur'd with idolatry. Nor, probably, had the Druids much op\nportunity of building another fuch work, as Stonehenge, between its foundati\non and the Roman times. Becau\u017fe, I apprehend, the encroachments of the\nGallic nations from the continent, feating them\u017felves in Britain, about 2oo\nyears before Cafar's inva\u017fion, had mole\u017fted the Druids much, in the\u017fe \u017fouthern\ncounties: and drove them with the old Britons, farther northward and we\u017ft\nward. But of this we will treat more particularly afterwards, when we offer\nour opinion, of the time when it was made.\nIn the orthographic plate, TA B. XII. we may fee the \u017ftri\u0107t geometry of the TA B. XII.\nwork of this outward circle, and the artful variation therefrom, in order to make\nthe aperture of the grand entrance \u017fomewhat wider than the re\u017ft. Mr. Webb\ndoes not take notice of this particular; and he might have triumph'd in it.\nFor 'tis no le\u017fs than a Vitruvian rule, to relax the intercolumniation ju\u017ft in the\nmiddle of the portico, in the front of a temple, and over-again\u017ft the door. He\nfpeaks of it in Lib. III. 2. when talking of the Eustyle ratio, the be\u017ft for u\u017fe,\nappearance and strength : he dire\u0107ts the intercolumniation to be of two diame\nters and #; but the middle intercolumniation of three diameters. By which\nmeans the approach to the door will be much more commodious, and nothing\ndimini\u017fh'd of beauty in a\u017fpect. And this is the reality of the cafe before us.\nBut alas, our Briti\u017fh prie\u017fts knew nothing of Witruvius ; they deduc'd this\nknack from an authority much ancienter than him, viz. from pure natural\nrea\u017fon, and good fen\u017fe. Nor does this hurt the whole of the work. The\naperture ought \u017ftri\u0107tly to have been two cubits equal to the re\u017ft, but they ad\nv\u00e2nc'd it to two cubits and a half. This only crowds the next intervals on each\nfide a \u017fmall matter nearer, the re\u017ft pre\u017ferving their true di\u017ftance quite round.\nAnd in the work it\u017felf, 'tis obvious enough to the naked eye. Again, there is\nanother remarkable particular ob\u017ferv'd by our prie\u017fts. Becau\u017fe the aperture of\nthe principal entrance we are fpeaking of, is wider than the re\u017ft: they have\nmade the impo\u017ft over it thicker than the re\u017ft, and 'tis equally obvious to the\nnaked eye. This was the more effe\u0107tually to fecure it from breaking. But\nthis additional thickne\u017fs they have put below. They were \u017fen\u017fible it would\nhave produc'd an ill effect at top, by breaking the line of that noble cincture.\nIt mu\u017ft be own'd this was extremely well adju\u017fted. And the breadth of the\nftone that hangs over head in this place is astoni\u017fhing. See Plate VII. call'd a TA B. VII.\npeep into the \u017fan\u010dium \u017fan\u010diorum. I had the greate\u017ft plea\u017fure imaginable, in the\nyear 1723, fuly, in being here for feveral days together, with the learned\nHeneage Lord Winchelsta.

My Lord and I were very careful in taking the mea\u017fures of Stonehenge;\nand with great grief we ob\u017ferv'd, the ftones here repre\u017fented in that Plate,\nand TA B.V. the front view, to be much deviated forwards from their true\nperpendicular, and in the utmo\u017ft danger of falling. \"Tis to be fear'd fome in\ndi\u017fcreet people have been digging about the great entrance, with ridiculous hopes\nof finding trea\u017fure, and loo\u017fen'd thereby the chalky foundation. We found\nby mea\u017fure, that the upper edge of the impo\u017ft overhangs no le\u017fs than 2 foot\n7 inches, which is very confiderable in a height of 18. The whole breadth at\nthe foundation is but 3 foot and a half. And this noble front is now chiefly kept\nup by the ma\u017fonry of the mortai\u017fe and tenon of the impo\u017fts.\nThro' the middle of the principal entrance, runs the principal line of the\nwhole work; the diameter from north-ea\u017ft to fouth-we\u017ft. This line cuts the\nmidde of the altar, length of the cell, the entrance, the entrance into the court,\nand fo runs down the middle of the avenue, to the bottom of the valley for\nalmo\u017ft 2ooo feet together. This is very apparent to any one at fir\u017ft fight, and\ndetermines this for the only principal entrance of the temple. All the other\nintervals of the ftones of the outer circle, have no preheminence in any re\nfpe\u0107t. There is no fuch thing as three entrances, which Mr. Webb's \u017fcheme\nfugge\u017fts. He might as well have pretended there are 6, for fo many points of\nhis triangles meet in intervals, at the verge of the outer circle. Upon this line\nare all the principal centers that compo\u017fe the work, it varies a \u017fmall matter\nfrom true north-ea\u017ft.\n- The contrivance of our artificers in making mortai\u017fes and tenons, between\nthe upright ftones and the imposts is admirable, but fo contrary to any pra\u0107tice\nof the Romans, that it alone is enough to di\u017fqualify their claim to the work.\nMuch judgment and good fenfe is \u017fhewn in the management of them. The\ncenters of the tenons are 2 cubits di\u017ftant from each other, upon each upright. By\nthis means there is 4 cubits di\u017ftance from the center of the tenon of one ftone,\nto the center of the tenon of its next neighbour, acro\u017fs the intervals, or in\none impo\u017ft. Divide the upper face of an upright into its 2 \u017fquares, the cen\nter of a tenon is in the center of that \u017fquare. Divide theunder face of an im\npoft, into its 3 \u017fquares, the corre\u017fpondent mortai\u017fes are in the centers of the\ntwo outermo\u017ft fquares, and thiswas the \u017ftri\u0107t geometrical method us\u2019d by the\nfounders: fo that the ftones fitted, as foon as plac'd in their true fituations.\nThe\u017fe tenons and mortai\u017fes of this outer circle are round, and fit one another\nvery aptly. The tenons and mortai\u017fes, are Io inches and a half in diameter,\nwhich is 3 palms, or half a cubit. They rather re\u017femble half an egg, than\nan hemi\u017fphere. The\u017fe mo\u017ft effe\u0107tually keep both uprights and impo\u017fts from\nluxation, and they mu\u017ft have u\u017fed great labour that threw them down. Sir\nRobert Sibbald \u017fpeaks of a rocking ftone in Ireland, contriv'd with mortai\u017fe\nand tenon like ours: of which Mr. Toland gives us an account, with other\nlike, the works of the Druids.\nThe whole height of upright and impost is 1o cubits and a half. The up-\nrights 9 cubits, the impo\u017ft I cubit and a half, \u017fo that the impo\u017ft is a 6th part\nof the height of the upright. If we mea\u017fure on the outfide, the colle\u0107tive\nbreadth of two upright \u017ftones, and the interval between them, 'tis 1o cubits\nand a halfequal to the whole height; and the interval is half the breadth of a\nftone, the thickne\u017fs of a \u017ftone is half its breadth. That impo\u017ft which lies over\nthe grand entrance, we faid, was deeper and longer than the re\u017ft. Abraham\nSturges an archite\u0107t, and my\u017felf mea\u017fured it, in pre\u017fence of Lord Winchelea.\nIts middle length is 1 I feet 1o inches, which is 6 cubits 4 palms; 2 foot 1 1\ninches high, which is 1 cubit 4 palms. They have likewi\u017fe added a little to its\nbreadth, more than the re\u017ft, being 3 foot 9 inches, which is 2 cubits and a\npalm. N. B. The fcale of my drawing is adapted for the infide of the cir\ncle, upon which the proportions in geometry are built: \u017fo that the\nbreadths\n\f*\n\u00a7{S\n|\nZ\n2\n\u00bb\n|\n%4\n\u2022\u2022 \u2022\n- - -\n- |\n- |\n* * * * * *\n* - - -\n- - *\n-\n** -\n..* -\n-*\n*\n. *\n- |\n.* -\n* |\n-\n- -\n- -\n..\" , .\n- *** A\n|- - - - -\n|\n- -\n-\n|\n\u2022 *\n- *, * --\n* * * *\n-N - -\n- -\n* - * - -\n- |- |\n- S , * * v.\n|- - -- - -\ns\u00bb s . |- -\n* * * * * |\nv.v - -\n- * * .*\n\u00c93. sa\n|\n-\n- --\n-\n-\n-\n-\n*- S . \u00bb . . .\n- \u00b7 , , , * NY\n|- -\nS *- *\n- -\n*\n- * \u2022 \u2022\n~ * * .\nS \u2022 v \u2022 \\\\\n\"-\" (-- N. -\n* *\nS - - |\n* ~\nS-- - -\n-\n\"** |- R\n|- - NRA\n|\nSTSSS NM\".\n* ... ~~ - R -\n- \u2022 Q -\n- , u\n~ -\n|\n~~ - 1\nS \u2022 ]\nEN: \u00bb NN\n:S |- -\n\",\" |\n- YN A\n~ J - |\n\",\" , 1\nN -\n- -\n\u00ab R.\n- * R\n- R |\n- Ng v -\n|\n|\nR- r\n-\n|\n-\n)\nm\nv\nS\nS\n'NN\nS\nS\nS N\nS\n| \u0161\n| \u0160.\n\u0160\n\f\u00ab\n\fD E s C R I B E D. I 9\nbreadths of the uprights and lengths of the impo\u017fts are \u017fomewhat more, than\nby the \u017fcale appearsthere. - The intelligent reader knows this mu\u017ft be the con\nfequence, in arks of a larger circle.\nNothing in nature could be of a more fimple idea than this va\u017ft circle of\nftones, and its crown-work or corona at top; and yet its effe\u0107t is truly majestic\nand venerable, which is the main requifite in facred \u017ftru\u0107tures. A \u017fingle ftone\nis a thing worthy of admiration, but the boldne\u017fs and great relievo of the\nwhole compages, can only be rightly apprehended, from view of the original.\nOn the outfide, the impo\u017fts are rounded a little to humour the curvity of the\ncircle, and within they are \u017ftrait, tho' they ought to be a little curv'd. This\nmakes them \u017fomewhat broader in the middle, than at the end, and broader than\nthe 2 cubits, which is the thickne\u017fs of the upright \u017ftones, upon an ichnography.\nSo that within, the crown-work makes a polygon of 3o fides. But this little\nartifice without debafing the beauty of the work in the leaft, adds much\nftrength to the whole, and to the impo\u017fts in particular. We may gue\u017fs their\nproportions are well chofe, when fo many of them are thrown down by vio\nlence, and not broke in the fall. And their greater breadth in the middle, or\nthat part that covers the intervals, adds to the folemnity of the place, by the\nfhadow they pre\u017fent at the bottom. The whole affair of jointing in this build\ning is very curious, and \u017feems to be the olde\u017ft and only \u017fpecimen of this kind\nof work in the world. There is nothing, that I know of, comes in competi\ntion withit, but the celebrated ruins at Per\/polis. TAB. XXXV. Itis compos'd TA :\nof great ftones laid acro\u017fs one another, as Stonehenge: but not with mortai\u017fe XXXV.\nand tenon. The vulgar and learned too, generally take it for the remains of\nthe palace of the Per\u017fian monarchs, burnt by Alexander the great; but it is\nreally an open temple like ours, and made much in the fame manner. But the\nftones are well \u017fquar'd, ornamented with mouldings and carvings, and the\nwhole of them are \u017fquares, not round works as here. Per\u017fepolis is a mixture,\nbetween the ancient patriarchal round form of open temples, and the fquare\nform introduc'd under the fewi\u017fh di\u017fpen\u017fation, in oppo\u017fition to the former,\nwhich were generally degenerated into idolatrous purpo\u017fes. But of this I\nfhall \u017fpeak more perhaps hereafter, when I treat of the mo\u017ft ancient tem\nles. -\nP Of the outer circle at Stonehenge which in its perfe\u0107tion confi\u017fted of 6o\nftones, 3o uprights and 3o impo\u017fts, there are more than half the uprights,\nviz. 17 left \u017ftanding. I 1 of the\u017fe uprights remain, continuous, by the grand\nentrance, five impo\u017fts upon them. , One upright at the back of the temple\nor on the \u017fouth-we\u017ft, leans upon a \u017ftone of the inner circle. There are fix\nmore lying upon the ground, whole or in pieces, . So that 24 out of 3o are\nftill vi\u017fible at the place. There is but one impo\u017ft more in its proper place.\nAnd but two lying upon the ground, \u017fo that 22 are carried off. Hence I in\nfer, this temple was not defac'd when chri\u017ftianity prevailed. But fome rude\nand \u017facrilegious hands carried the \u017ftones away for otherufes. However it can\nnot but be the highe\u017ft plea\u017fure imaginable to a regular mind, to walk round\nand contemplate the \u017ftately ruins which I have endeavour'd to pre\u017ferve in the\noutfide views, fuch as TAB.

And by comparing them with the draw\nings corre\u017fpondent, of the ruins, we gain aju\u017ft idea of the place, when it was\nin its perfe\u0107tion. But now as we are going to enter into the building, it will\nTA B. XI. be proper again to furvey the ground-plot, TAB. XI. which is fo different from\nthat publi\u017fh\u2019d by Mr. Webb. In\u017ftead of an imaginary hexagon, we fee a mo\u017ft\nnoble and beautiful ellip\u017fis, which compo\u017fes the cell, as he names it, I think\nadytum a proper word. There is nothing like it, to my knowledge, in all an\ntiquity; and 'tis an original invention of our Druids, an ingenious contrivance\nto relax the inner and more \u017facred part, where they perform\u2019d their religious of\nfices. The two outward circles do not hinder the fight, but add much to the\nfolemnity of the place and the duties, by the crebrity and variety of their in\ntervals. They that were within, when it was in perfe\u0107tion, would fee a mo\u017ft\nnotable effe\u0107t produc'd by thiselliptical figure, included in a circular corona, ha\nving a large hemi\u017fphere of the heavens for its covering.\nSomewhat more than 8 feet inward, from the infide of this exterior circle,\nis another circle of much leffer ftones. In the mea\u017fure of the Druids 'tis five\ncubits. This circle was made by a radius of 24 cubits, drawn from the com\nmon centers of the work. This \u017ftruck in the chalk the line of the circumfe\nrence wherein they fet the\u017fe \u017ftones. The \u017ftones that compo\u017fe it are 4o in num\nber, forming with the outward circle (as it were) a circular portico: a mo\u017ft\nbeautiful walk, and of a pretty effe\u0107t. Somewhat of the beauty of it may be\nTAB. XVII. \u017feen in Plate XVII. where, at pre\u017fent. 'tis mo\u017ft perfe\u0107t. We are impos'd on,\nin Mr. Webb's \u017fcheme, where he places only 3o \u017ftones equal to the number of the\nouter circle, the better to humour his fancy of the dipteric a\u017fpe\u0107t, p. 76. He\nis for per\u017fuading us, this is a Roman work compos'd from a mixture ofthe plain\nne\u017fs and \u017folidne\u017fs of the Tu\u017fcan order, with the delicacy of the Corinthian.\nThat in a\u017fpe\u0107t 'tis dipteros hypaethros, that in manner 'tis pycnostylos ;\nwhich when apply'd to our antiquity, is no better than playing with\nwords. For \u017fuppo\u017fe this inner circle confifted of only 3o \u017ftones, and\nthey fet as in his \u017fcheme, upon the fame radius, as tho\u017fe of the outer: what\nconformity has this to a portico properly, to an order, tuf\u010ban, corinthian -or\nany other, what fimilitude is there between the\u017fe \u017ftones and a column? where\none fort is \u017fquare oblong, the other oppofite (by his own account) pyramidal.\nOf what order is a column, or rather a pila\u017fter, where its height is little more\nthan twice its diameter? Where is the ba\u017fe, the \u017fhaft, the capital, or any\nthing that belongs to a pillar, pillafter or portico? the truth and fact is this.\nThe inner circle has 4o \u017ftones in it.

Again, Mr. Webb makes the\u017fe \u017ftones pyramidal in\nfhape, without rea\u017fon. They are truly flat parallelograms, as tho\u017fe of the\nouter circle. He fays, p. 59. they are one foot and a half in breadth, but\nthey are twice as much. Their general and defigned proportion is 2 cubits,\nor two cubits and a half, as they happen'd to find fuitable ftones. A radius of\n23 cubits \u017ftrikes the inner circumference: of 24 the outer. They are, as we\nfaid before, a cubit thick, and 4 cubits and a half in height, which is above\n7 foot. This was their \u017ftated proportion, being every way the half of the\nouter uprights. Such \u017feems to have been the original purpo\u017fe of the founders,\ntho' 'tis not very preci\u017fe, neither in de\u017fign, norexecution. In fome places, the\nftones are broader than the intervals, in fome otherwi\u017fe: fo that in the ground\nlot I cho\u017fe to mark them as equal, each 2 cubits and a half. There are \u017fcarce\nany of the\u017fe intire, as to all the\u017fe dimen\u017fions; but from all, and from the \u017fym\nmetry of the\u017fe Celtic kind of works, which I have been conver\u017fant in, I found\nthis to be the intention of the authors. \"Tis ea\u017fy for any one to fatisfy them\nfelves, they never were pyramidal; for behind the upper end of the adytum,\nthere are three or four left, much broader than thick, above twice; and not\nthe lea\u017ft \u017femblance of a pyramid. I doubt not but he means an obeli\u017fk, to\nwhich they might fome of them po\u017f\u017fibly be likened, but not at all to a pyra\nmid. Nor indeed do I imagine any thing of an obeli\u017fk was in the founders\nview; but the ftones dimini\u017fh a little upward, as common rea\u017fon dictates they\nought to do. Nor need we be\u017ftow the pompous words of either pyramid, or\nobeli\u017fk upon them. For they cannot be faid to imitate, either one or other,\nin \u017fhape, u\u017fe, much le\u017fs magnitude: the chief thing to be regarded, in a com\npari\u017fon of this fort. The central distance between the\u017fe \u017ftones of the inner cir\ncle, mea\u017fured upon their outward circumference, is 4 cubits. I ob\u017ferve fur\nther, that the two \u017ftones of the principal entrance of this circle, corre\u017fpondent\nto that of the outer circle, are broader and taller, and fet at a greater di\u017ftance\nfrom each other, being rather more than that of the principal entrance in the\nouter circle. It is evident too, that they are fet \u017fomewhat more inward than\nthe re\u017ft ; \u017fo as that their outward face \u017ftands on the line that marks the inner\ncircumference of the inner circle. I know no rea\u017fon for all this, unle\u017fs it be,\nthat the outfide of the\u017fe two \u017ftones, is the out\u017fide of the hither end of the el\nlipfis of the adytum: for \u017fo it corre\u017fponds by mea\u017fure upon the ground-plot.\nThis is apparent, that they eminently point out the principal entrance of that\ncircle, which is al\u017fo the entrance into the adytum. For five ftones on this\nhand, and five on that, are as it were the cancelli between the \/\u00e0n\u010d7um and\nJan\u010dium fan\u010diorum, if we may u\u017fe fuch expre\u017f\u017fions. 'Tis \u017fcarce worth\nmentioning to the reader, that there never were any impo\u017fts over the heads of\nthe\u017fe \u017ftones of the inner circle. They are \u017fufficiently fa\u017ften'd into the ground.\nSuch would have been no fecurity to them, no ornament. They are of a harder\nkind of \u017ftone than the re\u017ft, as they are leffer; the better to refi\u017ft violence.\nThere are but nineteen of the whole number left; but eleven of them are\nftanding in fitu. There are five in one place \u017ftanding contiguous, three in\nanother, two in another. The walk between the\u017fe two circles, which is 3oo\nfoot in circumference, is very noble and very delightful. Probably it gave Ini\ngo fones the idea of defigning that fine circular portico, which is one great\nbeauty, among many, in his drawings for White-hall, publi\u017fh'd lately from the\noriginals by my Lord Burlington; who has a true notion of the extraordinary\nmerit of that great man: and very commendably has reviv'd his memory.\nSuch a circular portico put in execution, would have a marvellous effe\u0107t, much\nexceed a common gallery in u\u017fe, becau\u017fe 'tis a perpetual walk, without turn\ning back, and well becomes a royal re\u017fidence. The be\u017ft view of this fort, to\nbe had from our work, is from the north, as in TAB. XVII. the reader cannot TAB, XVII,\nbut ob\u017ferve, how little pretence here is for an imitation of Greek or Roman\nportico's, notwith\u017ftanding the grand andggrad. curve of the outward\nUt\n\f22 J' 7' 0 N E H E N G E\nBut when we fee the di\u017fproportion of the inner circle in regard to any purpo\u017fe\nof this fort, we mu\u017ft own the invention of Hermogenes in contriving the p\u017feu\ndo-dipteros, is here apply'd with an ill grace. The founders of Stonehenge cou'd\nhave no need of make-\u017fhifts for want of room on Sali\u017fbury plain. Or how\ncould a concentric row of little ftones, or pillars if he will fo have it, bear any -\nre\u017femblance to the contrivance of Hermogenes, which confifted in having none;\nin taking away the whole inner row of pillars, fo as to add to the convenience\nof room, and preferve the a\u017fpe\u0107t, at the fame time? Mo\u017ft undoubtedly the\nDruids had no further meaning in it, than to make u\u017fe of the even numbers of\n3o greater ftones, and 4o lefier \u017ftones; and this was to produce a more per\nplexed variety, by the inter\u017ftices having no regard to one another. So far were\nthey from having a notion of Grecian beauty, in the pillars of circular por\ntico's being fet on the fame radius; pillar an\u017fwering to pillar, intercolumniati\non to intercolumniation. And this will be \u017fhown repeatedly in the progre\u017fs of\nthis work, to be the common pra\u0107tice of the Druids in other like in\nftances. -\nBut when we confider the cell, as Mr. Webb names it, we find him guilty\nof great difingenuity, in ill conceiving the form of it, and in di\u017ftorting his\nground-plots, to colour it over the better. The minute you enter this adytum,\nTA B: as in TAB. XVIII. you di\u017fcover 'tis not a hexagon, nor ever was intended for\n*VIII. one, and there can be no greater ab\u017furdity than to imagine it one. It is in\ntruth compos'd of certain compages of \u017ftones, which I \u017fhall call trilithons, be\ncau\u017fe made, each of two upright ftones, with an impo\u017ft at top: and there are\nmanife\u017ftly 5 of the\u017fe trilithons remaining. , But the naked eye ea\u017fily di\u017fcovers,\nthey are very far from making 5 fides of a hexagon. They cannot be brought\nto any approach, of a truly circular polygon. 3 trilithons of the 5 are remain\ning entire, 2 are ruin'd indeed, in fome mea\u017fure, but the ftones remain in fitu.\nAnd nothing is eafier, than to take the ground-plot, from \u017fymmetry and cor\nre\u017fpondency. We fee the two trilithons on the wings or fides of the adytum,\nare fet almo\u017ft in a \u017ftrait line, one of another; when in a hexagon form, they\nought to make a confiderable angle. If you examine them trigonometrically,\nthe true angle of an hexagon is 12o degrees, but here is an angle of near 15o.\nAnd by making it an hexagon, he \u017fuppo\u017fes one trilithon entirely gone, that\nneare\u017ft the grand entrance, when there is not the lea\u017ft appearance that ever\nthere were fuch \u017ftones there. No cavity in the earth, no \u017ftump or fragment\nvi\u017fible, nor is it ea\u017fy to imagine, how 3 ftones of fo va\u017ft a bulk could have\nbeen clean carried away, either whole or in pieces. There is no room for\nthem to have been carried away whole, no traces of their having been thrown\ndown, broke in pieces and fo carried away. This outer fide of the work be\ning the mo\u017ft perfe\u0107t of the whole. Of the ruins of the other trilithons, there\nis not the lea\u017ft part wanting. What has been thrown down and broke, re-\nmains upon the \u017fpot. But this trilithon in di\u017fpute, mu\u017ft needs have been \u017fpi\nrited away, by nothing le\u017fs than Merlin's magic, which ere\u0107ted it, as the\nmonks fable. Befides, if it were \u017ftill \u017ftanding, it would be very far from\nmaking this adytum a regular hexagon, to which he has accommodated his\nperipteros \u017fcheme: p. 87. Further, granting it was a regular hexagon, it\nwould be very far from corre\u017fponding with that \u017fcheme, or have the lea\u017ft ap\npearance, of its being taken from fuch a one. For our editor there, has con\nverted the cell quite from the nature of that at Stonehenge. He has made the\nupper end of hiscell at theletter H oppofite to the grand entrance G, nota tri\nlithon as it is notoriou\u017fly at Stonehenge, but an angular interval between 2 trili\nthons. It is not the fide of the figure, but the angle. Whereas it is mo\u017ft no\ntorious at Stonehenge, that the upper end of the adytum oppofite to the grand\nentrance, and to the whole length of the avenue and entrance between it and\nthe area, is a trilithon; not an angle or interval. And that trilithon is exceed\ning \u017ftately, tho' in ruins, one of the upright ftones being fallen, other\neaning.\n--\nz\n\f\u00a7\n\u0160\nS\n\u00a7\n\u0158E \u00a7 |\nRS\n\u0130\u015f\n\u00a7\n\u0160\n\u0160\n\u00a7\n\u00a7|\n\u00a7l\n.\n|\nP 22.

So that here, we have the cell converted full a 6th part of the whole\ncompa\u017fs, from its true and original fituation, and fo in all the \u017fchemes of Mr.\nWebb's book, not one excepted. In that, for in\u017ftance, Scheme I, p. 56, the\nhigh altar is plac'd at D not again\u017ft a trilithon, as it ought to be, opp\u1ecffite to\nthe grand entrance in the front of the temple, and to the (only) entrance be\nlow, into the area, but against an angle between two. If then you \u017fuppo\u017fe\nthat hexagon remov'd back a 6th part, fo as that a trilithon be fet behind the\nhigh altar, as it is really in the thing its felf, and upon the principal diameter of\nthe whole work: then this ab\u017furd con\u017fequence follows, that the oppofite tri\nlithon of the cell stands in the very mid\u017ft of the entrance into the cell, upon\nthe fame principal ground-line or diameter of the work, and quite obstr\u016f\u0107ts\nthe view and entrance into it. It is altogether as ridiculous, as if a dead wall\nwas built under St. Paul's organ-loft, which is and ought to be the chief en\ntrance into the choir. Befides, by Webb's ground plots and uprights, it \u017feems\nas if when you entred this adytum, there were 3 trilithons on the right, and 3\non the left, whereas it is mo\u017ft obvions, there are but two on the right, an\u0103\ntwo on the left; when you advance into it, the orderly way, from the north\nea\u017ft grand entrance of the avenue; which he him\u017felf p. 55. owns to be the\nprincipal. But I am tired of \u017fo ungrateful a ta\u017fk, which nece\u017fity alone could\nhave extorted from me.\nC H A P. V.\nOf the cellor adytum of Stonehenge. Of the Surgeons amphi\ntheater, London.\nI\u017fputations become cloi\u017fters and porticoe's. Let us now with minds\nfree from paffion, enter the adytum with an intent to find out its true\nfigure, to examine what it really was, and what it is. And that may ea\u017fily be\ndone, becau\u017fe (as I faid before) as to the trilithons of which it is chiefly com\npos'd, they are all remaining. Not a bit is loft, but what mi\u017fchievous and filly\npeople knock off with hammers, to fee whether, as the wretched vulgar notion\nwould have it, the ftonesbe fa\u0107titious. TAB. XVIII. is a de\u017fign of it, which\nI made fitting in the center of the grand entrance in the inner circle. This\npoint is properly the door-way or entrance into the adytum, as a wicket or little\ndoor, whil\u017ft the jambs of the hithermo\u017ft trilithons pre\u017fent them\u017felves, as the\ngreater door, of above 4o feet wide, 25 cubits. I ob\u017ferve in the old Greek \u017ftory,\nmany foot\u017fteps of the primitive patriarchal way left in their \u017facred \u017ftru\u0107tures,\nwhich are parallels to this work before us, and others of our Druids. For in\nftance, Pau\u017f\u00e0nias in atticis \u017fpeaks of a temple dedicate to Venus, in the front\nof which, is a wall (as he calls it) built of rude \u017ftones. Neverthele\u017fs he con\ncludes it to be a very famous work. One may very well imagine, this wall of\nrude \u017ftones is the remnant of fome fuch old work as ours, left for the \u017facred re\ngard the people had to it, even after art was rifen to great height, together with\nfuper\u017ftition and idolatry. For that the mo\u017ft ancient Greeks had very little of\nidolatry, any more than our Druids, I \u017fhall \u017fhow when I di\u017fcour\u017fe on that\nhead.

I \u017fuppo\u017fe it was in imitation of the ancient u\u017fage, without\ndoors to \u017fhut or open, as our temple here. For the ancients thought it wrong,\nto confine the deity, as it were, within any cover'd place: 'till Mo\u017fes, by God's\ndire\u0107tion, made a tabernacle cover'd with \u017fkins, which was to adumbrate the\nMe\u017ffiah Son of God, who was to be cloathed with our nature, And Solo\n- - - - - - -- - - - - - - - * - * - mon's\nTA B.\nXVIII.\n\f24 J' 7' 0 N E H E N G E\nmon's temple was builtin imitation of this tabernacle. But before that, the an\ncients meant no more by temples, or altars, as they were fir\u017ft call'd, than a\ncertain known and con\u017fpicuous place, ornamented in a particular manner, that\nfhould mark out a kebla, or a place towards which we are to addre\u017fs the Deity,\nand that for uniformity \u017fake. As the Turks and Arabians do now, who are the\nde\u017fcendants of I\u017fhmael, and had this cu\u017ftom from Abraham. Tho' the \u017fupreme\nBeing be omnipre\u017fent, yet for our convenience, where time, place, and fuch\nkind of circum\u017ftances are nece\u017f\u017fary to a public a\u0107tion, he would have, as it\nwere, the place of his pre\u017fence made notorious. As in the fewi\u017fh di\u017fpen\u017fation\nhe did in a mo\u017ft extraordinary manner, by the \/bechinah. And from Solomon's\ntemple, all the re\u017ft of the world borrow'd the fa\u017fhion of temples, properly\nfo call'd, built magnificently and with roofs. For the \u017facred hou\u017fes mention'd\nin \u017fcripture before then, were only little chapels, \u017fhrines, like our Druids kist\nvaens, which fometime they carried about in a cart, fometime were fix'd in ci\nties, for publick u\u017fe ; as Beth Dagon, and the like. The\u017fe were but kistvaens\nimprov'd, niches turn'd into facella, in imitation of two or three ftones in A\nbraham's altars, which we may well call the kebla, and find many of them a\nmong our Druid antiquities. -\nThe cell is form\u2019d by a radius of 12 cubits and a half, from the two centers a\nand b, as to the inward curve; the outward takes a radius of 15 cubits ; for\nthe\u017fe \u017ftones are two cubits and a half thick. The two circles are turn'd into an\noval, by a radius of 3o cubits, (after the u\u017fual manner) fet in the two centers\nc and d, where the two circles interfe\u0107t. The former centers are 12 cubits\nand a half di\u017ftant from each other, the length of the radius. The fame oval\nis obtain'd by a \u017ftring of 6o cubits, the ends ty'd together, and turn'd round\nupon two centers, according to the gardiners method. An oval form\u2019d as this\nis, upon two centers coinciding with each other's circumference; or, which is\nthe fame thing, who\u017fe centers are di\u017ftant from each other the length of their\nradius, is mo\u017ft natural and mo\u017ft beautiful, being the \u017fhape ofan egg, Mo\u017ft\nprobably the\u017fe religious philo\u017fophers had a meaning, in thus including an egg\nlike figure, within a circle, more than mere affe\u0107tation of variety. Whatever\nthat was, we may rea\u017fonably conclude, that from the method in antiquity, of\nmaking the kebla of a curved figure, the chri\u017ftians borrowed theirs of turning\nthe ea\u017ft end of their churches in that manner; and that the Druids in the work\nbefore us, have produc'd the noble\u017ft kistvaen or kebla that is known.\nMy purpo\u017fe in drawing many prickt lines upon the plate, is not difficult to\nbe under\u017ftood. Nor does it require particular explanations. To avoid affe\u0107tation\nor tediou\u017fne\u017fs, I leave them to the readers amu\u017fement: only ob\u017ferve, that Mr.\nWebb's equilateral triangles have no hand in forming the cell. The intent of\nit is very di\u017ftant from a regular polygon. But that it is incomparably more\nbeautiful; than \u017fuch a one would have render'd it. It is as a magnificent niche\n27 cubits long, and as much broad, mea\u017furingin the wide\u017ft place.\nThis part is call'd >nuo; or concha templi and adytum, into which, we may\nfuppo\u017fe, none but the upper order of prie\u017fts, together with the high-prie\u017ft,\nwere commonly to enter, during the time of mini\u017ftration, in religious rites.\nWe may imagine the beauty of the appearance here upon tho\u017fe occa\u017fions,\nwhen an innumerable company of the Druids affifted, all in white \u017furplices.\nThe center of the excentricity of this oval is but three cubits nearer the entrance,\nthan the center of the whole work. And they have cut off but one trilithon,\nwhich they make the opening of the adytum; meeting the eye to great advan\ntage, from the grand entrance. By aforefaid contrivance, there is left a\nfpace of five cubits between the jambs of the opening of the adytum, and the\ninner circle in front, ju\u017ft the fame as is between the inner and outer circle. The\ninner circle there performing the office of cancelli to it, as we ob\u017ferv'd before.\nIf a choir of this form was put in pra\u0107tice, and executed by a ma\u017fterly hand,\nit would have a very extraordinary effe\u0107t, and perhaps excel the too fimilar\nCOI1Ca VG\n\f-\n*Z\n\u017b\n|\n|\n-\n-\n-\ns\n-\n\f*) A\nR T O NJ F H E N G E\n\fD E S C R I B E D. 25\nconcave of a cupola. Our Druids had undoubtedly \u017fuch a notion, in placing\nthis within a circle. And for the fake of this, they turn'd the two circles\ninto a \u017fmaller \u017fpecies of an ellipfis. -\nThere's a Druid antiquity like our adytum in \u017fhape, call'd Eglwys Glominog,\non the top of Arennig vaur in Lhanykil pari\u017fh, Merionydh\u017fhire, but made of a\ncontinued wall. The ancients thought the world of an egg-like \u017fhape, and as\nthe world is the temple of the Deity, they judg'd it proper to form their tem\nples, fo as to have a re\u017femblance thereto. The ancient hieroglyphic of the Deit\nis a circle, and I have rea\u017fon to believe it more ancient than the flood.

So our Druids,\nas well as he, may mean the infinity of nature in the Deity, who made the\nworld, by this \u017fcheme of Stonehenge; at lea\u017ft they under\u017ftand by the circle,\nthe feat and re\u017fidence of the Deity, the heavens, which include all things.\nIt \u017feems to me, that Inigo fones from this adytum proje\u0107ted the plan of the\nSurgeons theatre in London, a fabric for feeing and hearing much admired b\nall good judges. And which my Lord Burlington, out of a \u017fpirit truly noble,\nand a great love for the architect's memory, has lately repair'd, with his own\ncharges and excellent \u017fkill. I find the Surgeons theatre (or rather amphitheatre)\nis form\u2019d from the fame proportion as our adytum, the tran\u017fverfe and conjugate\ndiameters being as 4 to 3, viz. 4o foot and 3o foot. And this appears to me\na \u017ftrong pre\u017fumption, that Inigo fones did not make the ground-plot of Stone\nhenge, publi\u017fh'd under his name. The Surgeons amphitheatre is a good deal\nle\u017fs than our cell. -\nSuch is the noble and ea\u017fy geometry of the adytum of Stonehenge. The\nftones that compo\u017fe it, are really \u017ftupendous, their height, breadths and thick\nnefs are enormous, and to fee fo many of them plac'd together, in a nice and\ncritical figure, with exa\u0107tne\u017fs; to confider, as it were, not a pillar of one\nftone, but a whole wall, a fide, an end of a temple of one ftone; to view\nthem curiou\u017fly, creates \u017fuch a motion in the mind, which words can't expre\u017fs.\nOne very remarkable particular in the con\u017ftru\u0107tion of this adytum, has e\u017fcaped\nall ob\u017fervers: which is this. As this part is compos'd of trilithons (as I before\ncall them) fett two and two on each fide, and one right before; they rife in\nheight and beauty of the \u017ftones, from the lower end of the adytu\u00bb, to the\nupper end. My meaning is this. The two hithermo\u017ft trilithons corre\u017fpond\ning, or tho\u017fe next the grand entrance, on the right hand, and on the left are\nexceeded in height, by the two next in order; and tho\u017fe are exceeded by the\ntrilithon behind the altar, in the upper end of this choir. So that in laying\ndown the mea\u017fures of the parts, that compo\u017fe this place, the reader mu\u017ft be\ncontent to take my word. Mr. Webb's mea\u017fures cannot be preci\u017fe in all of\nthem, feeing he knew nothing of this particular; and that his notion of an\nhexagon, is contradi\u0107ted by it, as well as by fa\u0107t. . \u201cHe \u017fays p. 6o. the \u017ftones\n\u201c of the greater hexagon \u017feven foot and a half in breadth, three foot nine\n\u201c inches thick, and twenty foot high, each \u017ftone having one tenon in the\n\u201c middle.\u201d His mea\u017fure of \u017feven foot and a half in breadth, only \u017fhews the\nvaftne\u017fs of the ftones, it is no precife mea\u017fure, for the founders regarded not\nany precifene\u017fs in their breadth: becau\u017fe two together were de\u017fign'd to make a\ncompages, whereon to fet the impo\u017ft, and this I call a trilitbon. Each trili\nthon \u017ftands by its felf, independant of its neighbour, not as the ftones and im\nposts of the outer circle, link'd together in a continued corona, by the impo\u017fts\ncarried quite round. Indeed the breadth of a \u017ftone at bottom is \u017feven feet and\na half, which is 4 cubits and a half. Two \u017ftones therefore amount to nine cu\nbits, and there is a cubit of interval between them, making in the whole ten\ncubits. But they were not careful of the particulars, only of the whole, in\none of the\u017fe compages or trilithons. I\nH Il\n\f26 J' 7' 0 N E H E N G E\nTA B. XV.\nThe \u017ftones of the cell are made to dimini\u017fh very much, towards the\ntop, mo\u017ft apparently with a defign, to take off from their weight, and\nrender them what we call top-heavy, in a le\u017fs degree. Hence the interval be\ntween thetwo upright ftones of the compages widens fo much upwards. This\nmu\u017ft certainly contribute very much, to their \u017ftability. In affigning 2o foot\nfor their height, Mr. Webb has well taken the medium. A very \u017fmall\nmatter more than 2o feet makes exa\u0107tly 12 cubits of the Hebrews, Egyp\ntians and Druids. The reader remembers the proportion I affign'd between the\nEngli\u017fh foot and this cubit. 2o inches and # make a cubit, therefore 2o feet\nand # make 12 cubits. The true ca\u017fe as to the height of the trilithons, is thus\nre\u017fpe\u0107tively, and which may be feen in TAB. XV. with the harmony and\nfymmetry, in the proportion of the whole. We may ob\u017ferve their gradual ri\nfing in height, all from the fame ba\u017fe, like pillars of higher orders and more\ndiameters. But the intelligent reader mu\u017ft needs \u017fee, that our founders never\nhad fight of Greek or Roman pillars, and never pretended to imitate them, or\ntake any one idea from them. And of the\u017fe three different orders or degrees of\naltitude, in the\u017fe trilithons, one exceeds the other by a cubit. So that their\nheightsre\u017fpectively are 13 cubits, 14 cubits, 15 cubits.\nThe imposts of the\u017fe trilithons are all of the fame height. Mr. Webb\np. 61. \u201cinformsus, the architrave lying on the top of the great \u017ftones of the\n\u201c hexagon and mortai\u017fedal\u017fo into them fixteen foot long, 3 foot 9 inches broad,\n\u201c 3 foot 4 inches high.\u201d Mr. Webb's 16foot long, is too \u017fcanty, it amounting\nto 9 cubitsand 2 palms, butthe intent of the founders was to make the\u017fe im\npo\u017fts equal both in length and breadth to the foundation of the upright \u017ftones\nthat \u017fupports them, I mean the two stones at bottom, the fu\u017ftaining part of\nthe compages, which in its whole breadth makes Io cubits; and Io cubits long\nthe imposts are to be affign'd. Mo\u017ft certainly whoever undertake to mea\u017fure\nthem, whether from tho\u017fe fallen on the ground, or \u017ftill in their proper place,\nwill be apt to fail in giving them ju\u017ft length. Both becau\u017fe 1, 'tis ob\u017fervable\nthat the\u017fe impo\u017fts are form\u2019d \u017fomewhat broader upwards, than in their bottom\npart; but this may not be taken notice of by every one. This was done very\njudiciou\u017fly upon an optical principle, which it is plain the founders were aware of\nFor a \u017ftone of fo confiderable an elevation, by this means only, pre\u017fents its\nwhole face in view. Therefore they that mea\u017fure it at bottom will not take\nits true length. 2. If they take the dimen\u017fion, either from a \u017ftone \u017ftill in its\nproper place, or from one fallen down, they will be very liable to \u017fhorten the\nmea\u017fure. For in the fir\u017ft ca\u017fe, the upper edge of the\u017fe impo\u017fts, mu\u017ft needs\nhave \u017fuffer'd from the weather, in fo elevated an expo\u017fure, thro' the \u017fpace of\n2ooo years. Itis very apparent they have \u017fuffered not a little. , Large and deep\nfurrows of age are vifible all around them. But if they mea\u017fure tho\u017fe fallen,\nthey mu\u017ft well imagine \u017fuch have doubly \u017fuffered, from weather, and from\nthe people every day dimini\u017fhing all corners and edges, to carry pieces away\nwith them. So that in this ca\u017fe, analogy and fymmetry only can \u017fupply the\u017fe\ndefe\u0107ts. Thus we found before, that the breadth of the impo\u017fts of the outer\ncircle is equal to their ichnographical breadth: fo it is here, being 1o cubits.\nBefides, the outer face of the\u017fe impo\u017fts is longer than the inner, as being in\nthe larger circle. Therefore ten cubits is to be under\u017ftood their medium mea\nfure.\nMr. Webb gives it as a general mea\u017fure, that they are 3 foot 9 inches broad.\nHe has before told us, the uprights which \u017fupport them were 3 foot 9 thick;\ntake that twice, it makes 7 foot and a half, which he affigns for the breadth, of\nthe uprights. This is all ju\u017ft within a trifle, and it is not expe\u0107ted that he\nwho was not aware of the cubit, by which the\u017fe works were made, \u017fhould do\nit with greater accuracy. The truth of the whole is this: Webb's 7 foot and half\nis 4 cubits and a half, as we faid before; the half of it is 3 foot 9, and a very\nlittle more. But this mu\u017ft be taken for the lea\u017ft breadth of the impo\u017fts, that\nat\n\f\u00a7\n\u0160\n\u0160\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\nRS\nk\n|s\n\u00a7\nS\n\u0160\n\u00a7\nS\n}\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7l\n{\n- . - * - * -\nV\n- - - - -\n-|\n|\n|| |\n|\n|\n| |||||||||||\n|\n| || ||\n||||||\n||||||\n\"\n|\n||\n|||||||||||||||\n| \" |\n|\n|\n| | | |\n|\n| | | | | | | | |||\n|\n| |\n|\n\u2013\n- - * - .\n- - * - - - - * -\n|\n| T |\n| |\n|| ||||||||\nP26 TAB.xiiii.\n|\u00a7.\u00c8|\u00a7.fi}\u00a7\n|\n\f\f\/\n|\nD E s c R I B E D. 27\nat the ends. For in the middle they are \u017fomewhat broader. Tho the infide\nfaces are \u017ftrait, yet, as we ob\u017ferv'd, in proper place, ofthe impo\u017fts of the outer\ncircle ; fo here, they are rounded behind: their outer circumference an\u017fwer- Ta a.

So likewi\u017fe their ends are\nmade upon a radius of that oval, whence the innner face of the impo\u017ft is\nfomewhat \u017fhorter than the outer, and is another rea\u017fon why their lengths may\neafily be taken fomewhat too \u017fhort. I have drawn the impo\u017fts in their true\nfhape in the ground-plot. The artifice of the tenons and mortai\u017fes of the\u017fe TA B. XI.\ntrilithons and their impo\u017fts, what conformity they bear to that of the outer cir\ncle, is exceedingly pretty, every thing being done truly geometrical, and as\nwould be\u017ft an\u017fwer every purpo\u017fe, from plain and fimple principles. In the\nbottom face of the impo\u017ft, if divided into three \u017fquares, the two mortai\u017fes are\nmade in the middle of the two outermo\u017ft \u017fquares. Draw diagonal lines from\ncorner to corner; where they interfe\u0107t, is the center of the mortai\u017fe; which\ncentral di\u017ftance from one to the other, is \u017feven cubits of the Druid mea\u017fure.\nEach tenon is a cubit broad upon its longe\u017ft diameter, for they are of an oval\nfigure. An admirable contrivance, that the impo\u017fts \u017fhould lie firm upon the\nheads of the uprights, and keep the uprights \u017fteady in their places, to \u017ftrengthen\nand adorn. We may remark this pretty device, in the management of the te\nnons and mortai\u017fes. Cut an egg acro\u017fs upon its \u017fhorte\u017ft diameter or conjugate;\none half thereof repre\u017fents the \u017fhape of the tenons of the outer circle. Cut it\nacro\u017fs upon its tran\u017fver\u017fe diameter, one half is the \u017fhape of the tenons of the\nadytum. \u2019Tis evident the meaning of it is this. The tenons of the outer cir\ncle are higher in proportion, than the others, becau\u017fe the imposts are le\u017fs and\nlower than the others, and on both accounts more liable to be di\u017fturb'd, either\nby accident or violence, than the others: therefore more caution is us'd for their\npre\u017fervation. This is an in\u017ftance of art, noble and fimple withal. Mr. Webb\nfays the impo\u017fts are 3 foot 4 inches high, which is preci\u017fely 2 cubits, a fixth\npart of the height of the medium order of trilithons; as the impo\u017fts of the outer\ncircle are a fixth part of the height of the ftones of the outer circle. The\nmedium order of trilithons is above 24 foot high, i. e. 14 cubits. The lower\norder is 13 cubits, viz. tho\u017fe next the entrance. The upper trilithon behind\nthe altar was 15 cubits. Each rifing a cubit higher than the other, as we be\nfore ob\u017ferv'd. -\nI promis'd to \u017fhow the reader what Stonehenge is, and what it was.

Tho I don't pretend, but that fome of my fore\ngoing mea\u017fures, may here and there po\u017fibly vary a little, upon a very \u017ftri\u0107t\ntrial, and where proper judgment is not us'd, becau\u017fe the ftones in \u017fome parts\nmay protuberate, or great parts of them may have fallen off; yet 1o foot dif\nTap. xix, ference from truth cannot be allow'd of In the Plates XIX and XX. ob\u017ferve\nXX. the infide of that upright \u017ftone, which makes the northern jamb of the chief\nentrance of the outer circle.

And in the\nmanagement of \u017fuch prodigious \u017ftones as the\u017fe are, fix'd in the ground, and\nramm'd too like po\u017fts: 'tis not to be wonder'd at, if by chance we find fome\nlittle variation. Tho for my own part, I ob\u017ferv'd none; rather wonder'd,\nhow it was po\u017f\u017fible for them, without lewices and the like devices, to fet them\nin their places to fuch preci\u017fene\u017fs. And the reader, who\u017fe mind has receiv'd no\nprepoffe\u017fion, cannot but be abundantly fatisfy'd, that the multitude of mea\nfures I have given from Mr. Webb's own account, are perfe\u0107tly agreeable to the\nfcale of cubits, deduc'd from works of the Egyptians and others: and that in\nround and full numbers, not trifling fra\u0107tions. If we collate the numbers given,\nwith the Roman \u017fcale, the mea\u017fures appear very ridiculous and without defign;\nand that is a fure way of confuting the opinion, of its being a Roman work.\nBut as the\u017fe \u017ftones are generally rough, and by time mu\u017ft \u017fuffer in all dimenfi\nons, 'tis not pra\u0107tical to take their true mea\u017fure, without nece\u017f\u017fary judgment,\nand relation had to \u017fymmetry.\nOf the\u017fe greater ftones of the adytum, as I ob\u017ferved before, there are none\nwanting. They are all on the \u017fpot, Io upright ftones, 5 corni\u017fhes. The tri\nlithon fir\u017ft on the left hand is entire in fitu, but va\u017ftly decay'd, e\u017fpecially the\ncorni\u017fh. There are \u017fuch deep holes corroded, in fome places, that daws make\ntheir ne\u017fts in them. The next trilithon on the left hand, is entire, compos'd\nof three mo\u017ft beautiful \u017ftones.

My\nLord Winchel\/ea and my\u017felf took a confiderable walk on the top of it, but it\nwas a frightful fituation. The trilithon of the upper end of the adytum, was\nan extraordinary beauty. But alas through the indi\u017fcretion probably, of fome\nbody digging there, between them and the altar, the noble impo\u017ft is diflodg'd\nfrom its airy feat, and fallen upon the altar, where its huge bulk lies unfra\u0107tur'd.\nRecidit in \u017folidam longo post tempore, terram\nPondus, & exhibuit jun\u010diam cum viribus artem.

The outer upright being the jamb of the entrance, is \u017ftill\nftanding, the other upright and impo\u017ft are both fallen forwards into the ady\ntum, and broke each into three pieces. I \u017fuppo\u017fe from digging near it. But\nfrom one piece of the impo\u017ft lying loofe, in the middle, between the jambs of\nthe adytum, Mr. Webb in the plan of his ruins of Stonehenge (being his 6th\nScheme) forms the remains of his imaginary 6th trilithon, \u017fuppo\u017fing it one of\nthe ftones of the inner or leffer hexagon, as he calls it. Yet if this fragment\nwas really a \u017ftump of \u017fuch a \u017ftone, as he would have it, ftill it would not\ncreate an hexagonal form of the cell, but \u017ftand ju\u017ft in the middle of the en\ntrance, and block it up in a very ab\u017furd, unfeemly, and incommodious a man\nner. And nothing can be more certain, than that there never was fuch a thing\nin being. That \u017ftone of the trilithon which is \u017ftanding, has a cavity in it\nwhich two or three per\u017fons may fit in, worn by the weather.\nStonehenge is compos'd of two circles and two ovals, re\u017fpe\u0107tively concen\ntric. At the di\u017ftance of two cubits inward from the greater oval, de\u017fcribe\nanother leffer oval, on which the ftones of the inner oval are to \u017ftand: 19\nftones in number, at about the central di\u017ftance of 3 cubits. This leffer oval is\nto be de\u017fcrib\u2019d by a \u017ftring and the 2 centers, as before. Or by 2 circles from a 1o\ncubit radius, and the 2 centers aand b, as ofthe otherbefore was \u017fpoken. Mr.Webb\nfays, p. 6o, \u201c the \u017ftones of the hexagon within, 2 foot 6 inches in breadth, one\n\u201c foot and a half thick and 8 foot high, in form pyramidal.\u201d His two foot\nand a half is our cubit and half, for the breadth of the\u017fe ftones; being but a\nthird of the breadth of the ftones of the greater oval. And the interval be\ntween \u017ftone and ftone, the fame. Their height is likewife unequal, as the\ntrilithons, for they rife in height as nearer the upper end of the adytum. Mr. TA B. XV,\nWebb's 8 foot affign'd, is a good medium mea\u017fure, for it is ju\u017ft 4 cubits and 4\npalms, the third part of the height of the medium trilithon. From the ruins\nof tho\u017fe left, we may well \u017fuppo\u017fe, the fir\u017ft next the entrance and lowe\u017ft\nwere 4 cubits high; the mo\u017ft advanc'd height behind the altar might be five\ncubits, and perhaps more. The stones are \u017fomewhat of what Mr. Webb calls a\nyramidal form, meaning that of an Egyptian obeli\u017fk, for they taper a little\nupwards. They are of a much harder fort than the other \u017ftones, as we \u017fpoke\nbefore, in the leffer circle. The founders provided that their lester bulk \u017fhould\nbe compen\u017fated in \u017folidity. They were brought \u017fomewhere from the\nwe\u017ft. Of the\u017fe there are only 6 remaining upright. The ftumps of two\nare left on the \u017fouth fide by the altar. One lies behind the altar, dug up or\nthrown down, by the fall of that upright there.

Behold the \u017folution of\nthe mighty problem, the magical \u017fpell is broke, which has fo long perplex'd the\nvulgar! they think 'tis an ominous thing to count the true number of the \u017ftones,\nand whoever does fo, \u017fhall certainly die after it. Thus the Druids con\ntented them\u017felves to live in huts and caves: whil\u017ft they employ'd many thou\nfands of men, a whole county, to labour at the\u017fe publick \u017ftru\u0107tures, dedicated\nto the Deity.\nOur altar here is laid toward the upper end of the adytum, at pre\u017fent flat on\nthe ground, and \u017fqueez'd (as it were) into it, by the weight of the ruins upon it.\n\"Tis a kind of blue coar\u017fe marble, \u017fuch as comes from Derby\u017fhire, and laid\nupon tombs in our churches and church-yards.

But eternally to be lamented is the lo\u017fs of that tablet of tin, which\nwas found at this place, in the time of King Henry VIII. (the \u00c6ra of re\u017ftitu\ntion of learning and of pure religion) in\u017fcrib'd with many letters, but in fo\nftrange a chara\u0107ter, that neither Sir Thomas Elliot a learned antiquary, nor\nMr. Lilly ma\u017fter of St. Paul's \u017fchool, could make any thing out of it. Mr.\nSammes may be in the right, who judges it to have been Punic; I imagine if\nwe call it Iri\u017fh, we \u017fhall not err much. No doubt but it was a memorial of\nthe founders, wrote by the Druids: and had it been pre\u017ferv'd till now, would\nhave been an invaluable curiofity. To make the reader fome amends for fuch\na lo\u017fs, I have given a \u017fpecimen of \u017fuppo\u017fed Druid writing, out of Lambecius's\naccount of the Emperor's library at Vienna. \"Tis wrote on a very thin plate\nof gold, with a \u017fharp-pointed in\u017ftrument.

I fufpe\u0107t this too was a tablet with an in\u017fcription on it, but\nfalling into the hands of the countrymen, they could no more di\u017fcern the\nwriting, than interpret it. No doubt but this was fome of the old Briti\/h\/tan\nnum, which the Tyrian Hercules, firnam'd Melcarthus, fir\u017ft brought ex Caffi\nteride infilla, or Britain. Which Hercules liv'd in Abraham's time, or foon\nafter.\nMr. Webb tells us, the Duke of Buckingham dug about Stonehenge: I fear\nmuch to the prejudice of the work. He him\u017felf did the like, and found what\nhe imagin'd was the cover of a thuribulum. He would have done well to have\ngiven us a drawing of it. But whatever it was, vafes of incen\u017fe, oil, flower,\nfalt, wine and holy water, were u\u017fed by all nations in their religious ceremo\nIl 1CS.\nMr. Thomas Hayward, late owner of Stonehenge, dug about it, as he ac\nquainted Lord Wincheff\u00e9a and my\u017felf. He found heads of oxen and other\nbeasts bones, and nothing el\u017fe. In 1724. when I was there, Richard Hayns\nan old man of Ambro\/bury, whom I employed to dig for me in the barrows,\nfound fome little worn-out Roman coins at Stonehenge, among the earth rooted\nup by the rabbets. He fold one of thern for half a crown, to Mr. Merril of\nGolden Square, who came thither whil\u017ft I was at the place. The year before,\nHayns was one of the workmen employ\u2019d by Lord Carlton to dig clay on\nHarradon hill, ea\u017ft of Ambre\/bury, where they found many Roman coins,\nwhich I \u017faw. I fufpe\u0107t he pretended to find tho\u017fe at Stonehenge, only for fake\nof the reward. My friend the late Dr. Harwood of Do\u0109fors-Commons told me,\nhe was once at Stonehenge with \u017fuch fort of Roman coins in his pockets, and\nthat one of his companions would have per\u017fuaded him, to throw fome ofthem\ninto the rabbit-holes: but the Do\u0107tor was more ingenuous. Neverthele\u017fs were\nnever fo many fuch coins found in Stonehenge, they would prove nothing more,\nthan that the work was in being, when the Romans were here; and which we\nare affured of already.

By Lord Pembroke's dire\u0107tion, I dug on the infide of the al\ntar about the middle: 4 foot along the edge of the ftone, 6 foot forward to\nward the middle of the adytum. At a foot deep, we came to the \u017folid chalk\nmix'd with flints, which had never been \u017ftir'd. The altar was exactly a cubit\nthick, 2o inches and #; but broken in two or three pieces by the ponderous\nmafies of the impo\u017ft, and one upright ftone of that trilithon which \u017ftood at the\nupper end of the adytum, being fallen upon it. I Ience appears the commodi\noufne\u017fs of the foundation for this huge work. They dug holes in the \u017folid\nchalk, which would of it\u017felf keep up the ftones, as firm as if a wall was built\nround them. And no doubt but they ramm'd up the inter\u017ftices with flints.\nBut I had too much regard to the work, to dig any where near the ftones. I\ntook up an oxe's tooth, above ground, without the adytu'n on the right hand\nof the lowermo\u017ft trilithon, northward.

I \u017fuppo\u017fed, they\nwere places, where two great va\u017fes ofwater \u017ftood, for the fervice of the tem\nple, when they perform\u2019d religious rites here. And I endeavour'd to illu\u017ftrate\nit by a coin of the city Heliopolis. 6o cubits is the diameter of Stonehenge, 6o\nmore reaches the inner edge of the circular ditch of the court. The ditch ori\nginally was near 3o cubits broad, but thro\u2019 long tra\u0107t of time, and the infini\nty of coaches, horfes, &c. coming every day to \u017fee the place, 'tis levell'd very\nmuch. The intire diameter of the court, reaching to the outward verge of the\nditch, is 4 times 6o cubits, which is about 41o foot. The five outer circles\nof the ditch are \u017ftruck with a radius of 8o, 9o, Ioo, 1 Io, 12o cubits.\nJu\u017ft upon the inner verge of the ditch, at the entrance from the avenue, lies\na very large ftone, at pre\u017fent flat on the ground. Mr. Webb, p. 57. pretends\nto give us the mea\u017fure of it, confounding it with the other two before-men\ntion'd to be within the vallum, to which they have no relation, no fimilarity\nin proportion. This is to favour his notion of three entrances of the area, de\npendant upon his hypothe\u017fis of equilateral triangles. He there tells us at the\n\u00ceetter F, \u201c the parallel \u017ftones on the infide of the trench were four foot broad\n\u201c and three foot thick; but they lie fo broken and ruin'd by time, that their\n\u201c proportion in height cannot be distingui\u017fh'd, much le\u017fs exa\u0107tly mea\u017fur'd.\u201d\nThus he, but 'tis invita Minerv\u00e1; for all three ftones, in all appearance, are\nas little alter'd from their fir\u017ft fize, as any \u017ftones in the work. The two \u017ftones\nwithin the vallum are very \u017fmall \u017ftones, and ever were fo. The one \u017ftands ;\nthe other leans a little, probably from fome idle people digging about it. This\nftone at the entrance is a very great one, near as big as any one of the whole\nwork, and \u017feems too as little alter'd from its original form: only thrown down\nperhaps by the like fooli\u017fh curiofity of digging near it. Instead of Webb's four\nfoot broad, it's near \u017feven : but to \u017fpeak in the Druid mea\u017fure, four cubits. It\nis at pre\u017fent above 2o foot long. If it \u017ftood originally, and a little leaning, it\nwas one of tho\u017fe \u017ftones which the Wel\u017fh call crwm lechen, or bowing-\u017ftones.\nHowever, Mr. Webb mu\u017ft falfify the truth very much, in making this and the\ntwo former any thing alike in dimen\u017fion, fituation and u\u017fe. But he does fo,\nmuch more in the next, which is doubtle\u017fs a crwm leche, \u017ftill \u017ftanding in its\noriginal posture and place in the avenue. \u2019Tis of much the like dimen\u017fion as\nthe other, tho' not fo \u017fhapely, and \u017ftands in like manner on the left hand, or\nfouth, of the middle line, of the length of the avenue. I \u017furmi\u017fe, the Dru\nids confider'd the propriety of making the other a little more \u017fhapely than this,\nbecau\u017fe within the area, and nearer the \u017facred fabric. There is the di\u017ftance of\n1 19 feet between them, to \u017fpeak properly, 8o cubits. . This interval Mr. Webb\ncontra\u0107ts to about 43 foot, and \u017fuppo\u017fes there was another ftone to an\u017fwer it on\ntherighthand, as al\u017fo another to an\u017fwer that on the infide the ditch. And he fu\npo\u017fes the like of tho\u017fe before-mention'd, both within and without the ditch, at\nhis two fancy'd entrances. But of the\u017fe, there is nec vola nec vestigium, and I\ndare fay, never was. This \u017ftone has a hole in it, which is ob\u017fervable of like\nftones, fet thus near our like temples: as we \u017fhall fee in the progre\u017fs of this\nwork. The ftone is of 24 foot in circumference, 16 high above ground, 9\nbroad, 6 thick. The u\u017fe of it I can't certainly tell; but I am inclin'd to :\nthat\nTA B.\nXXIII.\n\fJ' 7' 0 NV E H E N G E\nthat as part of the religious wor\u017fhip in old patriarchal times, confisted in a fo\nlemn adoration, or three filent bowings: the fir\u017ft bowing might be perform'd\nat this \u017ftone, ju\u017ft without the ditch, the \u017fecond perhaps at the next \u017ftone, ju\u017ft\nwithin the ditch. Then they turn'd by that ftone to the left hand, as the man\nner was, in a procefion round the temple, both the prie\u017fts and animals for \u017facri\nfice. At tho\u017fe two stones and water-vafes, probably there were fome wa\u017fhings,\nluftrations, or \u017fprinklings with holy water, and other ceremonies, which I\ndon't pretend to a\u017fcertain. Then upon the entry into the temple, perhaps\nthey made the third bow, as in pre\u017fence of the Deity. After this, in the court,\nwe may \u017fuppo\u017fe the prie\u017fts prepar'd the hecatombs and cu\u017ftomary \u017facrifices.\nIf that great \u017ftoneju\u017ft within the ditch, always lay, as it does now, flat on the\nround, and in fitu, (which I am not unwilling to believe) then, I apprehend,\nit was a table for dreffing the vi\u0107tims. Ezekiel, in de\u017fcribing the temple of\nJeru\u017falem, \u017fpeaks of \u017fuch in the entry, xl. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43.\n'Tisju\u017ft to think, the ancient form of \u017facrificing here, like that of the Ro\nmans, Greeks or elder nations, was pretty much the fame as that among the\nfews, and that as in patriarchal times; and in \u017fhort, no other than the origi\nnal pra\u0107tice of mankind, fince the fir\u017ft in\u017ftitution of \u017facrifices, at the fall.\nTh\u00e9refore we \u017fhall \u017fubjoin it from Homer's de\u017fcription, in Iliad I. It quadrates\nextremely well, in all appearance, with the place and temple before us.\nStraightway in hafte, a chofen hecatomb\nTo God, prepar'd, the well-built altar round,\nThey place in order. Then their hands they wa\u017fh,\nAnd take the falted meal. Aloud the prie\u017ft,\nWith hands uplifted, for the affembly prays.\nAfter the prayers, they wav'd the falted meal,\nAnd then retiring flay the animals.\nThe \u017fkins being \u00edtript, they cut off both the thighs,\nAnd cover them with cawl; fir\u017ft offer'd crude.\nThe prie\u017ft then burns a part on plates, + thereon red wine,\nLibation pour'd. The mini\u017ftring young men\nStand by him, with their five-fold \u017fpits in hand.\nBut when the thighs are burnt, out of the re\u017ft\nEntrails and fle\u017fh, harflets and ftakes they make,\nUpon the \u017fpits transfixt.

It an\u017fwers, as\nwe have faid before now, to the principal line of the whole work, the north\nea\u017ft, where abouts the fun rifes, when the days are longe\u017ft. Plutarch in the\nlife of Numa fays, the ancients ob\u017ferv'd the rule of fetting their temples, with\nthe front to meet the rifing fun. Promachidas of Heracleum, and Diony\u017fius\nThrax take notice of the fame thing. And this was done in imitation of the\nMo\u017f\u00e0ic tabernacle and Solomon's temple: probably a patriarchal rite. This\navenue extends it\u017felf, \u017fomewhat more than 17oo feet, in a \u017ftrait line, down to\nthe bottom of the valley, with a delicate de\u017fcent. I ob\u017ferve the earth of the\nditches is thrown inward, and \u017feemingly fome turfon both fides, thrown upon the\navenue: to rai\u017fe it a little above the level of the downs. The two ditches con\ntinue perfe\u0107tly parallel to the bottom, 4o cubits afunder. About midway, there is\na pretty depresture, natural, which diver\u017fifies it agreeably. Stonehenge, I \u017faid, is\nnot on the highe\u017ft part of the hill. I found, the rea\u017fon, why the Druids fet it\njuft where it is; becau\u017fe it is preci\u017fely 1ooo cubits from the bottom to the en\ntrance of the area. When I began my inquiries into this noble work, I\nthought it terminated here, and Mr. Roger Gale and my\u017felf meafur'd it fo far\nwith a chain. Another year, I found it extended it\u017felf much farther. For\nat the bottom of the valley, it divides into two branches. The ea\u017ftern branch\ngoes a long way hence, dire\u0107tly ea\u017ft pointing to an ancient ford of the river Avon,\ncalled Radfin, and beyond that the vi\u017fto of it bears dire\u0107tly to Harradon hill\nbeyond the river. The we\u017ftern branch, from this termination at the bottom\nof the hill I ooo cubits from the work at Stonehenge, as we faid, goes off with\na fimilar \u017fweep at fir\u017ft; but then it does not throw it\u017felf into a \u017ftrait line im\nmediately, as the former, but continues curving along the bottom of the hill,\ntill it meets, what I call, the curfes. This likewife is a new unob\u017ferv'd curio\nfity belonging to this work, and very much enlarges the idea we ought to en\ntertain, of the 'magnificence and prodigious extent of the thing. The temple\nwhich we have been hitherto de\u017fcribing, confiderable indeed as it really is, in\nit\u017felf; yet now appears as a \u017fmall part of the whole. I \u017fhall therefore de\u017fcribe\nall the\u017fe parts \u017feparately, to render them more intelligible: and then \u017fhow\ntheir conne\u0107tion, and what relation they have, to one another, as well as I\ncan. But it is not ea\u017fy to enter at once, into the exceeding greatne\u017fs of thought,\nwhich the\u017fe people had, who founded it; bringing in all the adjacent country,\nthe whole of nature hereabouts, to contribute its part to the work. Therefore\nI \u017fhall di\u017fcour\u017fe of it backward and forward; fir\u017ft going from Stonehenge to its\ntermination, or more properly its beginning, and then return again. Explain\ning all the way, what is its pre\u017fent condition, and what, 'tis rea\u017fonable to fup\npo\u017fe, was its original, when the Druids made their fir\u017ft defign. This together\nwith the feveral views I have drawn of it, will give us nearly as good a notion of\nthe whole, as we can at this day expe\u0107t, and perhaps pre\u017ferve the memory of\nit hereafter, when the traces of this mighty work are obliterated with the\nplough, which it is to be fear\u2019d, will be its fate. That in\u017ftrument gaining\nground too much, upon the ancient and innocent pa\u017ftoritial life; hereabouts,\nand everywhere el\u017fe in England: and by de\u017ftru\u0107tive inclo\u017fures beggars and de\npopulates the country.\nAt the bottom of the valley, and the end of the strait part of Stonehenge\navenue, Iooo cubits from Stonehenge, as we faid, the ea\u017ftern wing of the\navenue turns off to the right, with a circular \u017fweep, and then in a strait\nline\nTA B,\nXXVIII.\nTA B.\nXXVIII,\n\fS 7' 0 N E H E N G E\nline proceeds ea\u017ftward up the hill. . It goes ju\u017ft between tho\u017fe two most con\nfpicuous groups of barrows, crowning the ridg of that hill ea\u017ftward of Stone\nhenge; between it and Ve\u017fpastan's camp, \u017feparated from them both by a deep\nvalley on each fide. The\u017fe two groups of barrows are called generally the \u017feven\nking's graves, each. I call that mo\u017ft northerly, the old \u017feven kings graves,\nfor there are really 7, tho' but 6 mo\u017ft apparent; they are all fet at greater di\n\u00edtance, all broader, flatter, and as it is mo\u017ft rea\u017fonable to fuppo\u017fe, older than\nthe other. The other are fet clo\u017fer together, of a more elegantly turn'd figure,\ncampaniform, and in all appearance, much later than the former. Therefore\nI call the\u017fe, being fouthwatd and dire\u0107tly between Stonehenge and the town of\nAmbrg\/bury, the new feven kings barrows. Of the feven old, the mo\u017ft nor\ntherly one and probably the olde\u017ft, is exceeding flat and as it were, almo\u017ft\nfunk into the earth with age; \u017fo that it is \u017fcarce vi\u017fible at a di\u017ftance. The\navenue runs up to the top of the hill, ju\u017ft between them: and they make as\nit were wings to it, and I believe were defign'd as fuch, when fet there. When\nthe avenue fir\u017ft turns off in the valley, it is much ob\u017fcur'd by the wheels\nof carriages going over it, for a great way together: for this is the road to La\nvington. Neverthele\u017fs a curious eye, without difficulty, fees all the traces of\nit \u017fufficiently, till it is got higher up the ea\u017fy a\u017fcent of the hill, and out of the\ncommon road. Then it is very apparent and confi\u017fts of the two little ditches\nas before, (when coming dire\u0107tly from Stoilehenge) exa\u0107tly parallel, and \u017ftill\n4o cubits afunder. And it is made with the fame degree of variation, or about\n6 degrees \u017fouthward from the true ea\u017ft point. . So that it is evident again,\nthe Druids intended it \u017fhould go full ea\u017ft, but their compa\u017fs by which they\nfet it, varied fo much at that time, according to my opinion of the matter.\nTo perpetuate the mark of it as much as I can: I mea\u017fured the di\u017ftance of it\nfrom the \u017fouthern ditch thereof, to the ditch of the neare\u017ft i. e. mo\u017ft nor\ntherly of the new 7 kings barrows, and when in the right line oftho\u017fe 7 barrows:\nitis 257 feet. I know not whether there wasany de\u017fign in it, but it is exa\u0107tly\n15o cubits. From the northern ditch of the avenue here, to the neare\u017ft of the\nold \u017feven kings barrows, is 35o foot; which is exa\u0107tly 2oo cubits.\nWhil\u017ft we are here upon the elevation of this hill, between the\u017fe two groups\nof barrows, 'tis 27oo feet from the beginning of this wing of the avenue at\nthe bottom of the valley, where it commences. It \u017ftill continues in the ver\nfame direction ea\u017ftward, till unfortunately broke off by the plow'd ground,\n3oo feet from hence. This plow'd ground continues for a mile together, as\nfar as the river's fide at Amber\/bury. So that 'tis impo\u017f\u017fible to trace it any far\nther. The fir\u017ft plow'd field, that fouthward, is Mr. Hayward's; the other is\nof a different e\u017ftate, call'd Counte\/i-farm. And the plowing of the\u017fe two go\non at right angles one of another. That piece on the north fide of the avenue,\nof the latter tenure, goes along the line of the avenue, is long and narrow, and\nhas (as u\u017fual with greedy farmers) encroach'd upon and fwallow'd up fo much\nof the length of the avenue. And that amounts to 75o feet more in length,\nwhich mu\u017ft certainly be added to the avenue. This is all along the eastern\ndeclivity of the hill we are upon, that of the twice feven kings graves, and\nreaches near the bottom of the valley, between it and the hill whereon \u017ftands\nVe\u017fpastan's camp. , Now rea\u017fon and thejudgment I have got in converfing with\nworks of this kind, tell me, the founders would never begin this avenue at the\nbottom of a valley, but rather on a con\u017fpicuous height, which is vi\u017fible from a\ngreat distance of country round. We mu\u017ft \u017fuppo\u017fe the intent of the avenue\nwas to dire\u0107t the religious proce\u017f\u017fion to the temple; and that at the beginning\nof it, they made fires early in the morning of that day, when they held their\ngrand fe\u017ftivals, to give notice to all the country. Therefore when we\ncro\u017fs this valley still ea\u017ftward, with the former dire\u0107tion of the compa\u017fs, and\nmount that next hill, whereon \u017ftands Ve\u017fpastan's camp: we find exactly fuch\na place as we could wi\u017fh, and extremely \u017fuitable to that purpo\u017fe.

This eminence is north of Ve\u017fpastan's camp, north-we\u017ft from\nAmbre\u017fbury church. Here is a very large \u017fcene of the country taken in. It\nhas a fine gentle rife for half a mile and more, even quite from the ford at\nRadfin. You \u017fee the mo\u017ft delightful river Avon flank'd with villages on both\nfides, from almo\u017ft as far as new Sarum, and then to the head of it, 5 miles\noff. It was the cu\u017ftom of the Druids to give notice, by fires, of the quarterly\ndays of \u017facrifice. Thus the Druids in Ireland before chri\u017ftianity, us'd to kin\ndle a fire call'd in their language Tlachdgha, on Allfaints eve, to perform a\ngeneral \u017facrifice: as Mr. Llwyd mentions in his Iri\u017fh di\u0107tionary. Mr. Toland\nfpeaks of others too. I ob\u017ferv'd there has been a bank acro\u017fs the bottom of the\nvalley, for the more ea\u017fy pa\u017f\u017fage of the religious ceremony, and this much\ncorroborates my conje\u0107ture of the avenue reaching hither.\nPlate XXIV. explains all that I have la\u017ft faid about this avenue, and \u017fhews\nits dire\u0107tion to Haradon Hill, on the other fide the river.\nI am apt to believe from the conformity I have ob\u017ferv'd in the\u017fe works,\nthat there was a facellum or little temple here upon this hill, where the\navenue began. We \u017fuppo\u017fe this might ea\u017fily be de\u017ftroy'd when they began to\nplow here, being fo near the town. I have found feveral of the\u017fe kind of large\nftones, either travelling to Stonehenge, or from it. One as big as any at Stone\nhenge, lies about 3 miles off northward, in Durington fields. Another in the\nwater at Milford, another at Fighelden; they feem to have been carried back\nto make bridges, mildams or the like, in the river. There is another in the\nLondon road, ea\u017ft from Ambre\/bury, about a mile from the town. Another\nin the water at Bulford. A ftone \u017ftands leaning at Pre\u017fhute farm near the\nchurch, as big as tho\u017fe at Stonehenge. What confirms me in the conje\u0107ture\nthat there was a facellum here originally, is, that an innumerable company of\nbarrows on the oppo\u017fite hill, on the other fide of the river coming down Hara\ndon, and in the line of the avenue \u017feem to regard it; as is u\u017fual in the\u017fe works.\nFor tho\u017fe barrows are not in fight of Stonehenge it\u017felf, by rea\u017fon of the inter\npo\u017fition of the hill whereon \u017ftand the double groups of \u017feven king's graves.\nAnd even tho\u017fe two groups \u017feem to regard this little temple as well as the great\none, curving that way. The di\u017ftance from hence to Stonehenge is 4.ooo cu\nbits.\nIn order to have a ju\u017ft notion of this avenue, it is nece\u017f\u017fary to go to the neigh\nbouring height of Haradon hill, on the other fide the river. The large\u017ft bar\nrow there, which I call Hara's and which probably gave name to the hill, is in\nthe line of the avenue; the ford of Radfin lying between, as we fee in the la\u017ft\nPlate. I \u017ftood upon this hill May 11. 1724. during the total eclip\u017fe of the\nfun, of which I gave an account in my Itinerarium. Here is a mo\u017ft noble\nview of the work and country about Stonehenge. Whoever is upon the \u017fpot\ncannot fail of a great plea\u017fure in it; e\u017fpecially if the fun be low, either after\nrifing or before fetting. For by that means the barrows, the only ornaments of\nthe\u017fe plains, become very vi\u017fible, the ground beyond them being illuminated\nby the funs flaunting rays. You fee as far as Clay-hill beyond Warminster 2o\nmiles off You fee the \u017fpot of ground on the hill, whereon \u017ftands Ve\u017fpastan's\ncamp, where Iconje\u0107ture the avenue to Stonehenge began, and where there was\na\/acellum, as we conceive. From hence to that \u017fpot a valley leads very com\nmodiou\u017fly to Radfin, where the original ford was.\nThis Radfin-farm \u017feems to retain its Celtic name: meaning a ford or pa\u017f\u017fage\nfor chariots, the old way of carriage here u\u017fed.

I am per\u017fuaded it was originally a\nfeat ofan Archdruid or Druid. See Mr. Toland di\u017fcour\u017fing of the Druids hou\nfes, p. 1 I 1. The nuns of Ambre\/bury too had a chapel there. The ford is\nnow quite difus'd, becau\u017fe of the bridge by the town's end; and the road of it\nis foreclos'd by hedgerows of pa\u017ftures on both fides the lane, leading north\nwards from Ambr\/bury to north Wilt\u017fhire. This road lying between Radin\nand the beginning of Stonehenge avenue, is \u017fweetly adorn'd with viorna. We\nare \u017fuppo\u017fed now to \u017ftand on the tumulus of Hara, an old Iri\u017fh royal name,\nand po\u017f\u017fibly the king who was coadjutor in founding Stonehenge, who lived, it's\nlikely, in the ea\u017ftern part of Wilt\u017fhire : for which rea\u017fon they dire\u0107ted the\navenue this way.\nEt nunc fervat honos fedem, tuus, cffaque nomen.\nHere are very many barrows upon this fide of the hill, all looking toward the\nfacred work. Hence we furvey Ambro\/bury, Ve\u017fpa\u017fian's camp, and Stonehenge,\nthe cur\/its, and little Ambre\/bury. Likewife a very ancient barrow which an\nfwers to that of Weljastan's camp, \u017feeming to be plac'd here with fome regulari\nty and regard to the facellum at the beginning of the avenue. This is a long\nbarrow, which I \u017fuppo\u017fe the Archdruids who liv'd at Radfin, and perhaps the\nchief per\u017fon concern'd in proje\u0107ting the magnificent work. The reader mu\u017ft\nindulge me the liberty of the\u017fe kind of conje\u0107tures; there is no evidence pofi\ntive left in fuch matters of great antiquity. I have \u017fome little reafon for it,\nwhich I \u017fhall mention when we \u017fpeak of the barrows. There is this pre\u017fent\nu\u017fe, to afix thereby names to things, that we may talk more intelligibly about\nthem.\nWe are next to advance down Haradon-hill in the fame dire\u0107tion, nearer\nRadfin, from whence I drew Plate XXV. This valley leads us very gently to\nthe river.\nQga fe fibducere colles\nIncipiunt, mollique jugum demittere clivo\nU\/\u1eadue ad aquam. Virg.\nThis and the two views in Plate XXVI. give us a good notion of the country\non this fide. There are feven barrows together, in the road from Ambre\/bury\nto Radfin, one great one and fix little ones, which regard the facellum, but\ncannot po\u017fibly to Stonehenge. This was a family burying-place probably of\nfome confiderable per\u017fonage, who liv'd at Ambre\/bury. The\u017fe plates \u017fhow us\ntoo, the avenue marching up the next hill, where the old and new feven kings\nbarrows receive it again, as wings to it.

As foon as\nyou mount from the bottom, 'tis level for a great way together : and the whole\nlength of it is a kind of ridge, for it flopes off both ways from it on each fide ;\nfo that the rain runs off every way. Ju\u017ft about half way there is a depre\u017f\u017fure,\nas a pau\u017fe or foot pace, \u017fhowing one half of the avenue a\u017fcending, the other\nde\u017fcending, both magnificent, in the ancient gu\u017fto. There was a temple of\nfupiter Labradeus near Mylafa a city of Caria, much frequented. The\nway leading thither was called \u017facred, and pav'd 6o furlongs, thro' which\ntheir procefion went. Philostratus \u017fays, you went to the temple of Diana at\nEphe\u017fus, by a \u017ftone portico of a stadium. Pau\/anias in Phocicis \u017fays, the\navenue to the temple of Minerva Cranea near Elatea is a\u017fcending, but \u017fo gent\nly that it is imperceptible. Again in Chap. X. we read of a pav'd way, to\nthe oracle at Delphos. But the natural pavement of our avenue is much finer.\nI take notice, that fupiter Labrad\u00e6us was a \u017ftatue holding a halbard in his\nhand, which in\u017ftrument like afecuris or amazonian ax, was as a \u017fcepter to the\nLydian kings. And apparently our Engli\u017fh halbard is the very word, with\nan a\u017fperate way of pronunciation prefix'd, Labrada. So our Druids carried\nabout a \u017fharp bra\u017fs in\u017ftrument which we often find, call'd a celt, (I know not\nwhence) with which they us'd to cut the Mi\/letoe, at their great fe\u017ftival in mid\nwinter.

I. 18. mention is made of a famous round temple in\nThrace, where they celebrate mo\u017ft magnificent religious rites. It is upon the\nhill Zilmiffus. The temple is open at top. I \u017fuppo\u017fe like ours, not a little\nround hole like as in the Pantheon, nor is it a \u017fmall round facellum like tho\u017fe\nlittle round temples at Rome to Romulus, to Vesta, &c.

Many in our i\u017fland, which I \u017fuppo\u017fe older than\nStonehenge, confi\u017ft of one oval, or niche-like figure made of three ftones only,\n(of which our adytum is a more magnificent \u017fpecimen) and a circle of rude .\nftones fix'd in the ground; of which our work, crown'd with a circular cor-\nni\u017fh, is a more magnificent fpecimen. Sometime I meet with a niche without\na circle, \u017fometime a circle without a niche. We may well fay, the circle is\nanalogous to our chapels, churches, or cathedrals, according to their different\nmagnitude ; the niches corre\u017fpond to our choirs, altars, and more \u017facred part\nof the \u017facred building, the more immediate place of the re\u017fidence of the Deity. .\nThey are what now theTurks and Arabians call the kebla, deriv'd, as we faid\nbefore, from the patriarchal pra\u0107tice, and particularly from the great patriarch\nAbraham. I doubt not but the altars which he and his po\u017fterity made, men\ntion'd in \u017fcripture, were a ftone upon the ground before three fet in a niche\nlike figure, and the whole inclos'din a circle of stones. At other times they fet\nonly one stone for a kebla,as fometime our ance\u017ftors did likewi\u017fe. This practice\nwaspropagated generally among all ancientnations. Among many it was forgot\nten, or not pra\u0107ti\u017fed, where they had but little religion at all. Among others,\nafter idolatry had prevail'd with them, they thought all former manners of\nwor\u017fhip like their own, and mi\u017ftook the ftones which were kebla's or places of\nwor\u017fhip, for the objects of wor\u017fhip. Hen\u00e7e Maximus of Tyre fays, the Ara\nbians wor\u017fhipp'd he knew not what, for he \u017faw only a great ftone. Which,\nno doubt, was the kebla toward which they dire\u0107ted their devotion, as they\nhad learnt from Abraham, or the like patriarchal ance\u017ftors. So Pau\/anias in\nAchaicis \u017fays, the ancient Greeks wor\u017fhipp'd unhewn \u017ftones in\u017ftead of statues;\nmore particularly among the Pharii, near the statue of Mercury, were 3o\nfquare stones, which they wor\u017fhipp'd. If our author could not make his nar\nration agreeable to common fenfe, he might well mi\u017ftake this ancient patriar\nchal temple, \u017fomewhat like ours of Stonehenge, for a circle of deities: he\nhim\u017felf being a stranger to any other than image-wor\u017fhip. I \u017fhall handle this\nmatter more largely hereafter, and now let us de\u017fcend again from the temple to\nthe cur\u017fus. Only I would clo\u017fe this chapter with this \u017fhort reflection. This\navenue is proof enough (if there needed any) that our work is a temple, not\na monument, as \u017fome writers would have it. But it requires no formal confu\ntation. - -\nC H A P.\n\f--\n4Z\nA\n-\n-\n-\n|\n:\n\u00b7\n|\n|F2.#|}\n\u2022\n-|\n\f-\n\fD E S C R I B E D. 4. I\nC H A P. IX.\nOf the Cur\u017fus. Games exercis'd on holy festivals. The Druids\nunderstood geometry.\nBOUT half a mile north of Stonehenge, acro\u017fs the fir\u017ft valley, is the\ncur\u017fus or hippodrom, which I di\u017fcover'd august 6. 1723. \"Tis a noble\nmonument of antiquity: and illu\u017ftrates very much the preceding account of\nStonehenge. It was the univer\u017fal cu\u017ftom, to celebrate games, fea\u017fts, exercifes\nand \u017fports, at their more publick and folemn meetings to \u017facrifice. Which was\ndone quarterly and anniver\u017farily, at certain \u017ftated \u017fea\u017fons of the year. Macrob.\nSatur. I. fays, \u201c Upon holy days dedicated to the gods, there are \u017facrifices,\n\u201c fea\u017fts, games and fe\u017ftivals. For a \u017facred folemnity is, when \u017facrifices are\n\u201c offer\u2019d to the gods, or holy fea\u017ftings celebrated, or games perform\u2019d to their\n\u201c honour, or when holy days are ob\u017ferv'd.\u201d This great work is included be\ntween two ditches running ea\u017ft and we\u017ft in a parallel, which are 35o foot a\u017fun\nder. When I mention 35o foot, I \u017fpeak in the grofs, and as we \u017fhould fet it\ndown in an Engli\u017fh \u017fcale: but if we look into Plate VI. where I have given a TAB. VI.\ncomparative view of our Engli\u017fh foot, and the mo\u017ft ancient cubit ; at fir\u017ft fight\nwe difcern, this mea\u017fure means 2oo of the Druid cubits. This cur\u017fiis is a lit\ntle above 1oooo foot long: that is, it is made of 6ooo Druid cubits in length.\nA mo\u017ft noble work, contriv'd to reach from the highe\u017ft ground of two hills,\nextended the intermediate di\u017ftance over a gentle valley: fo that the whole cur\nfas lies conveniently under the eye of the mo\u017ft numerous quantity of \u017fpecta\ntors. To render this more convenient for fight, it is proje\u0107ted on the fide of\nrifing ground, chiefly looking fouthward toward Stonehenge. A delightful\n} from the temple, when this va\u017ft plain was crouded with chariots,\norfemen and foot, attending the\u017fe folemnities, with innumerable multitudes!\nThis cur\u017fus, which is two miles long, has two entrances (as it were :) gaps\nbeing left in the two little ditches. And the\u017fe gaps, which are oppo\u017fite to each\nother, in the two ditches, are oppo\u017fite to the \u017ftrait part of Stonehenge ave\nIlU16.\nI mention'd before, that at the bottom of the \u017ftrait part of Stonehenge ave\nnue, in the valley, the avenue divides it\u017felf into two parts. One goes dire\u0107t\nly ea\u017ft toward Radfin, the other goes northwe\u017ftward, and enters our cur\u017fus nearly\nat the \u017fame di\u017ftance we\u017ft from the gaps or entrances before-mention'd: as tho\u017fe\ngaps are from the ea\u017ft end of the hippodrom. , The\u017fe gaps being at a conveni\nent di\u017ftance from that ea\u017ft end, may be thought to be in the nature of distance\npo\u017fts. It \u017feems to me, that the turf of the adjacent ground on both fides, has\nbeen originally taken off, and laid on the whole length of this cur\u017fus, becau\u017fe\nit appears fomewhat higher in level. Tho' this was an incredible labour, yet a\nfine defign for the purpo\u017fe of running. The earth of the vallum is likewi\u017fe\nthrown inward.\nThe ea\u017ft end of the cur\u017fus is compos'd of a huge body of earth, a bank or\nlong barrow, thrown up nearly the whole breadth of the cur\u017fus. This \u017feems\nto be the plain of festion, for thejudges of the prizes, and chief of the \u017fpe\u0107ta\ntors. The we\u017ft end of the cur\u017fus is curv'd into an arch, like the end of the\nRoman circus's. And there probably the chariots ran round, in order to turn\nagain. And there is an ob\u017fcure barrow or two, round which they return'd, as\nit were, a meta.\nThis is the fine\u017ft piece of ground that can be imagin'd for the purpo\u017fe of a\nhor\u017fe-race. The whole is commanded by the eye of a \u017fpectator in any part.\nIn the middle is a valley, and pretty \u017fteep at pre\u017fent: yet only fo, as that a\nM Briti\u017fh\nTA B.\nXXVIII.\nTA B,\nXXIX.\n\f42.

But the exqui\u017fite foftne\u017fs of the turf prevents any great\ndamage by a fall. The ground of it hereabouts declines \u017fomewhat north\nward. The main part of this hippodrom is upon a gentle ridge running east\nand we\u017ft. This render'd the place cooler.\nOn the \u017fouthern ridge, toward the we\u017ft end of it, are many confiderable\nbarrows: but none towards the ea\u017ft end, for that would ob\u017ftru\u0107t the view of\nStonehenge. There are many barrows but of no confiderable bulk, on the\nnorth-fide, upon the extenfive a\u017fcent, toward the great north long barrow.\nThis magnificent work of the cur\u017fiis is drawn due ea\u017ft and we\u017ft: except a\nfmall variation of 4 or 5 degrees \u017fouthward from the ea\u017ft. If we mea\u017fure\nalong the bank, from the ea\u017ftern meta, at 7oo cubits exa\u0107tly, we come over\nagain\u017ft the middle line of the \u017ftrait part of the avenue to Stonehenge: 5oo cu\nbits further condu\u0107ts us to the gaps or oppofite entrances, I before mention'd;\nwhich we \u017fuppo\u017fe as di\u017ftance po\u017fts. The whole interval between the ea\u017ftern\nmeta and the\u017fe gaps, is 12oo cubits. At 1ooo cubits more, we come to the\nplace where the we\u017ft wing of the avenue enters the \u017fouthern ditch of the cur\nfils. That we\u017ft wing too, isju\u017ft 1ooo cubits long to its union, with the \u017ftrait\npart of Stonehenge avenue. Likewife the strait part of Stonehenge avenue is ju\u017ft\nIooo cubits long, as mention'd in its proper place. This we\u017ft wing begins,\nin the bottom of that valley, which croffes the middle of thecur\u017fus and \u017fweep\ning along by the bottom of the hill, in a gentle curve, meets with the lower\nend of the strait part of Stonehenge avenue, where the wing or avenue unites\nto it, with an equal angle. So that the whole work is laid out with great\njudgment and \u017fymmetry; and curiou\u017fly adapted to the ground, which was\nwell confider'd, before the plot was mark'd out, by the fir\u017ft furveyors. From\nthe bottom of the valley croffing the middle of the cur\u017fiis, to the we\u017ftern meta\nis 38oo cubits more, making in the whole 6ooo cubits. The north end of\nthe ea\u017ftern meta does not extend \u017fo far as the northern bank of the cur\u017fus: I\nfuppo\u017fe, the rea\u017fon is, that there might be liberty that way, to \u017ftop the horfes,\nat the end of the cour\u017fe. Therefore they fet out, on the fouth fide of the cur\nf\u00fcs and return\u2019d by the north fide. I ob\u017ferve the ditch and bank towards the\nea\u017ftern end of the cur\u017fus much ob\u017fcur'd, by the trampling of men and horfes,\nfrequenting the \u017fpe\u0107tacles here: this being the mo\u017ft throng'd.\nThe Cur\u017fus is dire\u0107tly north from Stonehenge: fo exa\u0107tly, that the meridian\nline of Stonehenge paffes preci\u017fely thro' the middle of the Curf\u00fcs. And when\nwe \u017ftand in the grand entrance of Stonehenge and ob\u017ferve the two extremities of\nthe Cur\u017fus the ea\u017ftern and we\u017ftern meta, they are each exa\u0107tly 6o degrees from\nthe meridian line; on each hand: making a third part of the circle of the ho\nrizon. By which we fee, the Druids well under\u017ftood the geometry of a circle,\nand its mea\u017fure of 36o parts.\nPau\u017f\u00e0nias in Beotic. fays, \u00ba among the Thebans, by the gate Pr\u00e6tis is the\n* Gymna\u017fium of folaus and likewi\u017fe the stadium, which is a bank of earth\n* thrown up, \u017fuch as that at Olympia and of the Laurii. In the \u017fame place is\n\u2018 the heroical monument of folaus. A little beyond, to the right is the hippo\n* drom, and in it Pindar's monument. The fame author in Arcad. VIII. writes,\n* that before the walls of Mantinea, in a field, was a stadium made for hor\u017fe\n* races, in honour of Antinous. Not far from it was the temple of Neptunus\n* equestris and others. So that we fee it was the manner of the ancient Greeks\nthus to define their places for \u017fports by banks of earth, and that near their temples.\nAfter the Romans had borrow'd the u\u017fe of the Briti\u017fh chariots for travelling\nand the like, they us'd them too in the Circenstan games.

Another upon the river Lowther by Perith in Cumberland.\nThe\u017fe places by rivers, were more agreeable to the Greek ta\u017fte, as in a hot\nter country. Another like place of \u017fports, was in the chalky valley ju\u017ft with\nout the town of Royston, on the \u017fouth fide of it, by the London road. The\nold Roman road there, or Hernien-street pa\u017fies over one corner of the work,\nas being of later date. I may, perhaps, de\u017fcribe the\u017fe more largely, another\ntime.

The\u017fe barrows\nare the artificial ornaments of this va\u017ft and open plain. And it is no \u017fmall en\ntertainment for a curious per\u017fon, to remark their beauties, their variety in form\nand magnitude, their fituation. They are generally of a very elegant campa\nniform \u017fhape, and done with great nicety.

Probably the prie\u017fts and laity were \u017fomeway di\u017ftingui\u017fh'd; as well as\ndifferent orders and \u017ftations in them. Mo\u017ft of the barrows have little ditches\naround, extremely well defin'd. In many is a circular ditch 6o cubits in dia\nmeter, with a very \u017fmall tumulus in the center. 6o or even 1oo cubits is\na very common diameter in the large barrows. Often, they are fet in rows,\nand equidi\u017ftant, \u017fo as to produce a regular and pretty appearance, and with fome\nparticular regard to the parts of the temple, the avenues, or the cur\u017fis.\nFor in\u017ftance, where the avenue begins at the fir\u017ft elevation, from Radfin ford,\nadvancing towards Stonehenge, \u017feven large and flat old barrows are on the right\nhand of the avenue, towards the ea\u017ft end of the cur\u017fus, \u017feven large barrows\nof a newer \u017fhape, are on the left hand: both the\u017fe groups before \u017fpoken of,\nare plac'd in a fimilar manner, in regard to the avenue, and as wings or\nopenings to it. Upon every range of hills, quite round Stonehenge, are \u017fucce\u017f\nfive groups of barrows, for fome miles: and we may even ob\u017ferve, that great\nbarrow by Lord Pembroke's park at Wilton, which I call the tomb of Carvilius,\nis fet within view of Stonehenge.\nIn 1722, my late Lord Pembroke, Earl Thomas, who was pleas'd to favour\nmy inquries at this place, open'd a barrow, in order to find the po\u017fition of the\nbody ob\u017ferv'd in the\u017fe early days. He pitch'd upon one of tho\u017fe \u017fouth of\nStonehenge, clo\u017fe upon the road thither from Wilton: and on the ea\u017ft fide of\nthe road. \"Tis one of the double barrows, or where two are inclos'd in one\nditch : one of tho\u017fe, which I \u017fuppo\u017fe the later kind, and of a fine turn'd bell\nfa\u017fhion. It may be feen in Plate IX. On the we\u017ft fide, he made a fe\u0107tion\nfrom the top to the bottom, an intire \u017fegment, from center to circumference.\nThe manner of compo\u017fition of the barrow was good earth, quite thro', except\na coat of chalk of about two foot thickne\u017fs, covering it quite over, under the\nturf. Hence it appears, that the method of making the\u017fe barrows was to dig\nup the turf for a great \u017fpace round, till the barrow was brought to its intended\nbulk. Then with the chalk, dug out of the environing ditch, they powder'd\nit all over. So that for a confiderable time, the\u017fe barrows mu\u017ft have look'd\nwhite : even for fome number of years. And the notion of fan&tity annex'd\nto them, forbid people trampling on them, till perfe\u0107tly fettled and turf\u2019d over.\nHence the neatne\u017fs of their form to this day. At the top or center of this\nbarrow, not above three foot under the \u017furface, my Lord found the \u017fkeleton\nof the interr\u2019d; perfe\u0107t, of a rea\u017fonable fize, the head lying toward Stonehenge,\nor northward. -\nThe year following, in order to pro\u017fecute this inquiry, by my Lord's order,\nI begun upon a barrow north of Stonehenge, in that group \u017fouth of the cur\u017fus.\n'Tis one of the double barrows there: and the more ea\u017fterly, and lower of the\ntwo: likewi\u017fe \u017fomewhat le\u017fs. It was rea\u017fonable to believe, this was the \u017fepul\nture of a man and his wife: and that the leffer was the female: and \u017fo it\nprov'd, at lea\u017ft a daughter. We made a large cut on the top from ea\u017ft to\nwe\u017ft. After the turf taken off, we came to the layer of chalk, as before, then\nfine garden mould. About three foot below the \u017furface, a layer of flints, hu\nmouring the convexity of the barrow. The\u017fe flints are gather'd from the fur\nface of the downs in fome places, e\u017fpecially where it has been plow'd. This\nbeing about a foot thick, re\u017fted on a layer of \u017foft mould anothe, foot: in which\nwas inclos'd an urn full of bones. This urn was of unbak'd y, of a dark\nreddi\u017fh colour: crumbled into pieces. It had been rudely wrot t with \u017fmall\nmouldings round the verge, and other circular channels on the us tfide, with\nfeveral indentures between, made with a pointed tool, as depi\u0107ted in Plate\nXXXII. where I have drawn all the forts of things found in this barrow. The\nbones had been burnt, and crouded all together in a little heap, not fo much\nas a hat crown would contain. The collar bone, and one fide of the under\njaw are grav'd in their true magnitude.

But we recompos'd the a\u017fhes\nof the illu\u017ftrious defunct, and cover'd them with earth. Leaving vi\u017fible marks\nat top, of the barrow having been open'd, to diffuade any other from again\ndi\u017fturbing them: and this was our pra\u0107tice in all the re\u017ft.\nThen we op'd the next barrow to it, inclos'd in the fame ditch, which we\nfuppos'd the hu\u017fband or father of this lady. At fourteen inches deep, the\nmould being mix'd with chalk, we came to the intire \u017fkeleton of a man.\nThe \u017fkull and all the bones exceedingly rotten and peri\u017fh'd, thro' length of\ntime. Tho' this was a barrow of the late\u017ft fort, as we conje\u0107ture. The body\nlay north and \u017fouth, the head to the north, as that Lord Pembroke open'd.\nNext, I went we\u017ftward, to a group of barrows whence Stonehenge bears ea\u017ft\nnorth-ea\u017ft. Here is a large barrow ditch'd about, but of an ancient make. On\nthat fide next Stonehenge are ten leffer, \u017fmall, and as it were crouded together.\nSouth of the great one is another barrow, larger than tho\u017fe of the group, but\nnot equalling the fir\u017ft. It would feem, that a man and his wife were bury'd\nin the two larger, and that the re\u017ft were of their children or dependants. One\nof the \u017fmall ones, 2o cubits in diameter, I cut thro', with a pit nine foot in\ndiameter, to the furface of the natural chalk, in the center of the barrow ;\nwhere was a little hole cut. A child's body (as it \u017feems) had been burnt here,\nand cover'd up in that hole: but thro' the length of time confum'd. From\nthree foot deep, we found much wood afhes \u017foft and black as ink, fome little\nbits of an urn, and black and red earth very rotten. Some \u017fmall lumps of\nearth red as vermilion : fome flints burnt thro'. Toward the bottom a great\nquantity of a\u017fhes and burnt bones , From this place I could count 128 bar\nrows in fight. See a va\u017ft multiplicity of 'em, TAB. XXXI. -\nGoing from hence more \u017foutherly, there is a circular di\u017fh-like cavity dug in\nthe chalk, 6o cubits in diameter, like a barrow revers'd. \u2019Tis near a great bar\nrow, the lea\u017ft of the \u017fouth-we\u017ftern group, \u2019Tis between it, and what I call\nthe bu\u017fhbarrow, fet with thorn-trees, TA B. XXXII. This cavity is \u017feven feet\ndeep in the middle, extremely well turn'd, and out of it, no doubt, the adja\ncent barrow is dug, The u\u017fe of it \u017feems to have been a place for \u017facrificing and\nfeasting in memory of the dead, as was the ancient cu\u017ftom. \u2019Tis all overgrown\nwith that pretty \u017fhrub erica vulgaris, now in flower, and \u017fmelling like honey.\nWe made a large cro\u017fs fe\u0107tion in its center upon the cardinal points; we found\nnothing but a bit of red earthen pot.\nWe dug up one of tho\u017fe I call Druid's barrows, a \u017fmall tump inclos'd in a\nlarge circular ditch. I cho\u017fe that next to bu\u017fhbarrow, we\u017ftward ofit. , Stone\nbenge bears hence north-ea\u017ft. We made a cro\u017fs fe\u0107tion ten foot each way,\nthree foot broad over its center, upon the cardinal points, At length we found\nN - a fquari\u017fh\nTA B.\nXXXI.\nTA B.\nxxxii.\n\f46 J' 7' 0 N E H E N G E\na fquari\u017fh hole cut into the \u017folid chalk, in the center of the tumulus. It was\nthree foot and a half, i. e. two cubits long, and near two foot broad, i. e. one\ncubit: pointing to Stonehenge directly: It was a cubit and half deep from the\nfurface. This was the domus exilis Plutonia cover'd with artificial earth, not\nabove a foot thick from the furface. In this little grave we found all the burnt\nbones of a man, but no figns of an urn. The bank of the circular ditch is on\nthe outfide, and is 12 cubits broad. The ditch is 6 cubits broad (the Druid's\nftaff) the area is 7o cubits in diameter. The whole Ioo. -\nI open'd another of the\u017fe of like dimen\u017fions, next to that Lord Pembroke fir\nopen'd, \u017fouth of Stonehenge. We found a burnt body in a hole in the chalk,\nas before. Mr. Roger Gale was with me.\nIn \u017fome other barrows I open'd, were found large burnt bones of horfes and\ndogs, along with human. Al\u017fo of other animals as \u017feem'd; of fowl, hares,\nboars, deer, goats, or the like. And in a great and very fiat old fa\u017fhion'd bar\nrow, we\u017ft from Stonehenge, among fuch matters, I found bits of red and blue\nmarble, chippings of the ftones of the temple. So that probably the interr\u2019d\nwas one of the builders. Homer tells us of Achilles flaying hor\u017fes and dogs, at\nthe funeral of his friend Patroclus.\nLord Pembroke told me of a bra\u017fs fword dug up in a barrow here, which was\nfent to Oxford. In that very old barrow near little Amber\/bury, was found a\nvery large bra\u017fs weapon of 2o pounds weight, like a pole-ax. Said to be given\nto col. Wyndham. In the great long barrow fartheft north from Stonehenge, which .\nI call north long barrow, and \u017fuppofd to be an Archdruid's, was found one\nof tho\u017fe bra\u017fs in\u017ftruments call'd celts, which I hold to belong to the Druids,\nwherewith they cut off the mi\u017fletoe, as before mention'd. Mr. Stallard of\nAmber\u017fbury gave it to Lord Burlington, now in Sir Hans Sloane's cabinet: 13\ninches long. They dug a cell in a barrow ea\u017ft of Amber\/bury, and it was in\nhabited for fome time. There they found all the bones of a horfe. This is\nthe fum of what is mo\u017ft material, that fell within my ob\u017fervation, relating to\nthe barrows about Stonehenge. We find evidently, the\u017fe ancient nations had\nthe cu\u017ftom of burning their dead bodies, probably before the name of Rome.\nSo lachrymatories we read of in \u017fcripture, ancienter than Greek or Roman times,\nP\u017falm lvi. 8.\n:\nTAB.

The Tyrian Hercules brought the Druids hither,\nwith Abraham's religion. Apher a grand\/on of Abraham's,\nhis companion.\nHave inform\u2019d the reader, to the be\u017ft of my \u017fkill, what was, and what\nis the \u017ftate of Stonehenge, both above, and below ground. I apprehend,\nit will be expe\u0107ted, that I \u017fhould \u017fay fomewhat, concerning the antiquity and\ntime of ere\u0107ting the\u017fe works, e\u017fpecially of Stonehenge. But what can we \u017fay,\nof a matter fo very remote? where the olde\u017ft memoirs and reports of the old\ne\u017ft nation inhabiting the i\u017fland, can give us no fatisfa\u0107tion about it: but are as\nfar to feek, as to the founders of this wonderful work, as we are, at this time,\nand are forced to apply to magic: in order to account for it. Notwith\u017ftand\ning, I \u017fhall endeavour to fatisfy the readers curiofity, in this point, as well\nas I can; by giving him my own opinion about it. Not doubting of his\ncandour, in fo arduous an attempt: which may perhaps be an amu\u017fement\nto him, whether it gains his belief, or not. Therefore, I \u017fhall recite, in \u017fhort,\nwhat occurs to me, on this \u017fubje\u0107t. 1. As to the antiquity of the\u017fe temples\nin general. 2. Of the time of founding Stonehenge.\nThe former will anticipate, in fome fort, what I promis'd, in treating of\nthe temples of the Druids in general. But I am naturally led to it, here, by\nob\u017ferving, that the name of the adjacent town of Amher\u017fbury, points out a\nrelation to the work of Stonehenge, and to the ancient name of it. For as we\ntook notice at fir\u017ft, the pre\u017fent name of Ston enge, is purely Saxon, given by\nour late\u017ft ance\u017ftors, by a people wholly \u017ftrangers to the purport of the thing,\nthat had no notion, no report of its having once been a \u017facred place; and fig\nnifies no more than hanging-\u017ftones, or a \u017ftone-gallows. The ancient Britons\ncall'd it choir-gaur, which the Monks latiniz'd into chorea gigantum, the giants\ndance; a name fuited to the marvelous notion they had of the \u017ftru\u0107ture, or\nof the reports of magic, concern'd in raifing it. But I had rather chu\u017fe to\nthink choir gaur in Wel\u017fh, truly means, the great church; the cathedral, in\nour way of \u017fpeaking. A general title, which the Wel\u017fh inhabitants, the rem\nnants of the Belgae, conquer\u2019d by the Romans, gave it; as well knowing the\ntrue u\u017fe of it, and even frequenting it in a religious way. Tho' they had dri\nven off the fir\u017ft po\u017f\u017fe\u017ffors of it, and the builders: I mean in Divitiacus his\ntime, or fooner, before the Roman inva\u017fion.\nThere is a very plain rea\u017fon: that Stonehenge was built, before the Wan\/dike\nwas made, and that was the la\u017ft boundary of the Belgic kingdom in Britain.\nThe ftones of which Stonehenge is compos'd, were fetcht from beyond that\nboundary, confequently then an enemies country. It \u017feems not improbable,\nthat the Wan\/dike was made, when thisBelgic kingdom was at its height, and\nthat time we may well gue\u017fs at, from Ce\u017far. \u201c He tells us in B\u00fc. Gall. Lib.\nII. 4. \u201c the Belgie are of German original. By force of arms, they poste\u017fs'd\n\u201c them\u017felves of the countries, \u017fouth of the Rhine and towards the ocean, dri\n\u201c ving out the Gauls. They were a very warlike nation, and could produce\n\u201c 1ooooo men in arms. That one of their kings Divitiacus, in the me ;\n- 6 C.\nO\n\fS 7' 0 N E H E N G E\n\u201c of fome then living, obtain'd the government, both of great part of Gaui\n\u201c and in Britain too.\u201d I believe the Belgae and Sicambri, all one people of\nGerman original. Our Wel\u017fh call them\u017felves Cymri, and from them Cumber\nland has its name. It is very ju\u017ft to think this Wan\/dike was made in the time\nof Divitiacus, both becau\u017fe of the greatne\u017fs of the work, fuiting \u017fo potent a\nprince, and becau\u017fe it is the la\u017ft boundary : after that time, the Roman power\nfwallowing up all divi\u017fions.\nI judge, we may rea\u017fonably place the time of making the Wanflike, about\n5o years before Ca\u017far wrote, we may \u017fay Au c. 65o. Divitiacus probably\nordered it to be made in perfon. And it \u017feems to have been drawn from the\nupper end of the Tes river, about Whit-church, and Andover, in Hamp\u017fhire:\nto the Avon river, about Bristol. The\u017fe two rivers and the Wan\/dike \u017feparated\nthe Belgic kingdom from the old Celtic Britons. They by this means, were\ndriven from this beautiful country, and from their \u017ftately temple of Stonehenge,\nby the\u017fe powerful invaders. It is remarkable enough, that the inhabitants of\nSomer\u017fet\u017fhire, the ancient feat of the Belg\u00e6, retain \u017ftill the Belgic, liquidating\npronunciation, v confonant for f. z for s.\nThe Devizes is a town in the middle of the length of Wan\u017flike, very pro\nbably ere\u0107ted, among others, to fecure this ditch or fortification. It \u017feems to\nhave been the capital fort or frontier town, and to have its name from the king,\nas a trophy or monument of his power: built by him in per\u017fon. Anonymus\nRavennas may pofiibly call it Pun\u010diuobice, but we have no certainty, that his\ncopy retains the word uncorrupt, or that he tran\u017fcribed it right: nor what altera\ntion the Romans made in the original word, nor what was made in the later\nand barbarous times. However there \u017feems enough therein, as well as in the\npre\u017fent name of the town, to countenance our conje\u0107ture. The former part\nof the word pun\u010diuo, which Mr. Baxter thinks mon\u017ftrous, may come, per\nhaps, from the German word pooghen, which fignifies an arduous work, and\nmight regard the ca\u017ftle here, which is faid to have been once, the \u017ftronge\u017ft\nin Europe. Neubringenfiscalls it Diviste. They tell us legendary \u017ftories of its\nbeing built by an old Briti\u017fh king.\nDivistis was probably the name of this Belgic Monarch, or Duiguis : as\nGluiguis king of Demetia in Wales is wrote Glivif\u00fcs in Toland, p. 186. and\nthe termination may have been form\u2019d into Latin, from the Celtic word\ntaeog dux. Whence, perhaps, the Etru\u017fcan Tages, fo much boa\u017fted of\nin their antiquities; likewife the modern Doge of Venice. So that Divitiacus\nmay well be Divif\u00fcs dux. The name of the Wan\u017flike, I fhewed to be purely\nCeltic, p. 4.\nIt is an ancient oriental cu\u017ftom to make the\u017fe boundary ditches. Thus the\nland belonging to the feveral tribes of I\u017frael was marked out by a ditch, as we\nread in the accounts of the holy land. Particularly the author of le voyage de\nla terre fainte, printed 1675. Paris, p. 57. \u017fays, \u201c he travell'd five or fix miles\n\u201c along fuch a ditch going from foppa to feru\u017falem, which parted the tribes\n\u201c of Benjamin and fudah.\u201d \u201dTis recited fo\/hua xv.\nThe monki\u017fh writers make much ado about Aurelius Ambro\u017fius, a chri\u017ftian\nkingofthe Britons (in the time of our great ance\u017ftorHengist) building Stonehenge,\nby the help of Merlin Ambro\u017fius the magician, in memory of the Briti\u017fh nobility\nflain treacherou\u017fly by Hengist, at Ambre\/bury. Some \u017fay the fa\u0107t was com\nmitted ad pagum Ambri, others call it c\u00e6nobium Ambrij, others ad montem\nAmbrij. One while they refer the name to Ambro\u017fius, another time to an\nAbbot Ambrius, and this was among our Roman Briti\u017fh ance\u017ftors, who were\nchri\u017ftians. They add too, that Merlin fetch'd the\u017fe \u017ftones out of Ireland,\nthat they had been brought before, out of Africa into Ireland: that he fet them\nup here in the fame form, by art magic; and that the ftones were of a medi\ncinal Virtue. The\u017fe matters we read in Girald. Cambren\u017f de admirand. Hib.\nc. 18. Higden's Polychron. v. Geoff.

But I need not be tedious in ob\u017ferving, how abfurd the Monki\u017fh re\nports are; of a chri\u017ftian king ere\u0107ting Stonehenge, as a \u017fepulchral monument\nfor the Briti\u017fh nobility, mafiacred in the mona\u017ftery of Ambrg\/bury. At the\nfame time they fay, their bodies were buried in the church-yard of the mo\nnaftery. Nor how they confound the names of Ambro\u017fius the king, Ambrius\nthe abbot, the town, abby and mountain of Ambry, and perhaps of Merlin\ntoo, for one of them was call'd Ambro\u017fius. But their affirming, the edifice\ncame out of Africa into Spain, thence into Ireland, thence into Britain, and\nof its being ere\u0107ted here in the fame form, by art magic; and that the ftones\nare of a medicinal virtue: the\u017fe notions lead us to the original truth, of\nthe Druid founders, and that Stonehenge had originally, the name of Ambres,\nand from it the adjacent town of Amhrg\/bury had its name.\nTo pur\u017fue this matter a little further. Between Stonehenge and the town,\nhanging over the river, upon elevated ground is a fine and ancient camp, com\nmonly call'd We\/pa\/ian's, and not without much probability, attributed to him.\nWe have often had occa\u017fion to mention it before. That great man, de\u017ftin'd\nby providence for executing his final vengeance, on the people of the fews,\nand thereby accompli\u017fhing our Saviour's predi\u0107tions; by his \u017fucce\u017fi\u00e8s in this\nplace, pav'd a road to the imperial dignity. Having conquer'd the i\u017fle of\nWight, he pur\u017fued his good fortune, higher up into this country, where he\nmade this camp, and another acro\u017fs the heath, call'd ? ang\/bury; which \u017feems\nto retain the latter part of his name. The camp we are \u017fpeaking of near\nAmbre\/bury, is an oblong \u017fquare, nicely placed upon a flexure of the river,\nwhich clo\u017fes one fide and one end of it. There is an old barrow inclos'd in it,\nwhich, doubtle\u017fs was one of tho\u017fe belonging to this plain, and to the temple\nof Stonehenge, before this camp was made. It is pretty to ob\u017ferve, that the\nroad from Stonehenge to Ambr\/bury, runs upon the true via pr\u00e6toria of the\ncamp. The Generals tent or pr\u00e6torium was in that part fouth of the road, be\ntween it and the river, toward little Ambro\u017fbury. There is another gate of\nthe camp, at the lower end, northward, the porta pr\u00e6toria ordinaria, in the\nRoman language. Now I apprehend, that Stonehenge was originally call'd\nthe Ambres, from thence this camp was call'd Ambr\/burgh, and thence the\nname of the town underneath.\nMr. Camden writes, \u201c that near Penfans in Cornwall, is a very remarkable\n\u201c ftone, call'd main Ambre, which tho' it be of a va\u017ft bigne\u017fs, yet you may\n\u201c move it with one finger: notwith\u017ftanding a great number of men cannot\n\u201c remove it from its place. The name is interpreted the ftone of Ambro\u017fius.\u201d\nA pi\u0107ture ofit in Norden's hi\u017ftory of Cornwall, p. 48. I have \u017feen one of the\u017fe\nrocking \u017ftones, as call'd commonly, in Derby\u017fhire. Mr. Toland in his hi\u017ftory\nof the Druids, mentions it too, and fays there are \u017fuch in Wales and in Ireland.\nSir Robert Sibbald mentions them in Scotland, all rightly judg'd to have been\ndone by the Druids. Sir Robert \u017fpeaking of the rocking stone near Balvaird\n(or the Bards town) in Fife: \u201c I am inform\u2019d (fays he) that this ftone was\n\u201c broken by the u\u017furper Cromwell's foldiers. And it was di\u017fcover'd then, that\n\u201c its motion was perform'd, by a yolk extuberant in the middle of the under\n\u201c \u017furface of the uppermo\u017ft stone, which was inferted in a cavity, in the fur\n\u201c face of the lower \u017ftone.\u201d This is the artifice of the \u017ftones at Stonehenge,\nbut applied here by the Druids for a moveable principle, as there, for \u017ftabili\nty. I call them mortai\u017fe and tenon: and before ob\u017ferv'd them to be of an egg\nlike form; which Sir Robert calls a yolk. The Main Amber in Cornwall was\nlikewi\u017fe destroy'd in the civil wars, by one of Oliver's governors . The\u017fe re\nformers had a notion of the\u017feworks being \u017fuper\u017ftitious matters. Main Ambre is\nlapisAmbro\u017fius, orpetra Ambrosta. Andthat nameleads us to confider the famous\nO petr\u00e6\n\f5o ,5 \/ O N E H E N G E\npetre Ambroste, on the coins of the city ofTyre. A \u017fpecimen of them, I have\ndrawn on the Plate following.\nAMB POC IE\nII ET PE\n|\n|\nN\nR\nThe\u017fe, and many more of the like fort, struck by the city of Tyre, in honour\nof their founder Hercules, may be feen in Vaillant's \u017fecond Volume of colony\ncoins, pag. 69, 148, 2 18, 25 I, 337.\nThey repre\u017fent two great, rough ftones, call'd petrae ambro\u017fie, with an al\ntar before them, and an olive tree; Hercules the hero of Tyre, the famous Na\nvigator of antiquity, their founder, \u017facrificing. On fome of the coins fetre\namhroffe wrote in Greek. He is repre\u017fented indeed like the Greek Hercules,\nbut in the latter times of the Roman empire, when the\u017fe coins were \u017ftruck,\nthey at Tyre were as far to feek about the true meaning and origin of their fir\u017ft\nantiquities, as we of ours. And what knowledge they had of them, was from\nlegendary reports of the Greeks, who chiefly, among the heathens, had the\nknack of writing. The\u017fe reports, as we may find in Nonnus his Diony\/iacs, 4o.\nand 41. acquaint us, that Hercules invented \u017fhipping, as a latin poet too inti\nmates, Tibullus.\nPrima ratem ventis credere dh\u1ebfta Tyrus.\nThey acquaint us that he ordered Tyre to be built, where the petr\u00e6 ambro\nfiae \u017ftood, which were two moveable rocks, \u017ftanding by an olive tree. He\nwas to \u017facrfice on them, and they \u017fhould become fixt and stable: rather, the\nCity \u017fhould bebuilt with happy au\u017fpice, and become permanent.\nHere are our Main Ambres, made artfully moveable, a kind of altars, or pil\nlars, the fame as the pillars of Hercules fo fam'd, and as little under\u017ftood. They\nwere the original patriarchal altars, for libations and \u017facrifices, and mean, in\ngeneral, their Altars, whether moveable or immoveable: or as we may \u017fpeak,\ntheir temples, which imply an altar properly, inclo\u017fed with ftones and a ditch,\nor ground dedicated and fet apart for public celebration of religious rites. For\nthe word Ambro\u017fius means in general, con\u017fecrated, dedicated to religious\nu\u017fe.\nBefidethe petr\u00e6 ambrostae of Tyre, and our main ambres of Britain and Ire\nland, we meet with another in Heph\u00e6stion's Hi\u017ftory III. 3. \u201c Speakingof Her\n\u201c cules, he mentions the Gygonian \u017ftone, as he calls it, near the ocean, which\n\u201c may be mov'd with the stalk of an a\u017fphodel, but can't be remov'd by any\n\u201c force\u201d .

'Tis\nthe moving and memorable hi\u017ftory of young facob, fent away from his fa\nther's hou\u017fe alone, to take a long journey to fome unknown relations. . He\ncame to a place, call'd afterward Bethel, and fleeping with his head on a ftone\nfor a pillow, had a cele\u017ftial vi\u017fion; and a promi\u017fe from God, of the highe\u017ft\nimportance to him and all mankind. Awaking, he thought the place had\nbeen holy ground, where, perhaps, his grandfather Abraham had before-time\nbuilt an altar; an hou\u017fe of God, or gate of heaven, as he elegantly names it.\n\u201c Therefore he ro\u017fe up early in the morning, which was one circum\u017ftance (in\n\u201c patriarchal\n\f52 J' 7' 0 N E H E N G E\n\u201c patriarchal times) of the work he was going about, and took the \u017ftone that\nC C | had put for his pillow, and fetit up for a pillar; and poured oil upon the\n\u201c top of it, and called the place Beth-el, i. e. the hou\u017fe of God. Then he vow\n\u2018 ed, that if God would plea\u017fe to pro\u017fper him in his journey, and bring him\n\u201c back into his own country, he would build a temple there, and con\u017fecrate to\n\u201c God the tythe of his \u017fub\u017ftance, as was the manner in tho\u017fe times.\u201d\nThis is in reality a votive, patriarchal temple, altar or hou\u017fe of God, which\nhe not only vows to build, but at the fame time endows it. The ftone which\n\u0159acob anointed, was not an altar properly, lying on the ground whereon to\nmake a libation, but he fet it up as a pillar. It was one of the upright ftones,\nwhich the \u017fcripture calls pillars, as \u017ftanding of it\u017felf; a part of the circle of\nftones, inclofing the altar. And by the a\u0107t of anointing, facob confecrated it,\nas the manner then was, de\u017ftined it for a facred purpo\u017fe, as an earne\u017ft of his\nwill in good time to fulfil it. And this he did fulfil, chap. xxxv. building the\ncelebrated temple of Bethel.

No wonder fuch matters are ob\u017fcur'd, thro\u2019\nfo long di\u017ftance of time.

That very gygonian \u017ftone, for ought\nI fee, may be our rocking-\u017ftone near Penfans, it stands by the \u017fea-fide. Nor\ndo I fee any ab\u017furdity, if wejudge, that it was ere\u0107ted there, by Hercules in\nperfon. Near it is that other famousDruid temple call'd Bi\u017fcawoon, confisting\nof 19 pillars in a circle and a central kebla. The entrance is made of 2 fome\nwhat larger ftones, than the re\u017ft: not improbably one of the Herculean labours.\nIt is affirm\u2019d by the be\u017ft authors, that our Tyrian Hercules, the more ancienter\nHercules, built the city of Gadis, at Cadiz now. And where-ever Hercules\ncame, there we read of his pillars. Thus Avienus.\nHic Gadir urbs est, di\u010dia Tarteffius prius,\nHic fiunt column\u00e6 pertinacis Herculis.\nArrian II. of the life of Alexander, remarks, \u201c that Gadis was built by the\n\u201c Ph\u00e6nicians. There was a temple of Hercules. The form, the \u017facrifices\n\u201c and ceremonies there perform'd, are all afer the Ph\u00e6nician manner.\u201d Stra\nbo in his Lib. III. fays there were two pillars in this temple, dedicate to Hercu\nles; which the learned Tristan in his commentaries on medals, p. 384. fays, he\ndoubts not, but they werepetr\u00e6 ambrosta, in imitation of tho\u017fe ofthe fame name,\nin the temple of Hercules of Tyre, which Herodotus in Euterpe \u017fpeaks of He\nappears to have been an extraordinary genius, and a man of great piety withal.\nTherefore where-ever he came, he made the\u017fe patriarchal temples, or fet u\npillars of \u017ftone, as antiquity called them. Ju\u017ft as the patriarchal family did\nin the land of Canaan. And Hercules \u017feems to me, to have been a great man,\nrai\u017fed up by providence, to carry the reform\u2019d patriarchal religion, to the ex\ntremest part of the then known we\u017ftern world. Here, I \u017fuppo\u017fe, the reli\ngion of Abraham remain'd pure, for many ages, under the Druids, till per\nhaps corrupted by incur\u017fions from the continent. It is remarkable, that the\nRomans, who were \u017fo catholic, (different from tho\u017fe we now ab\u017furdly call Ro\nman catholics) as to permit all religions, per\u017fecuted only that of the Druids,\nand the chri\u017ftian: whence we are naturally led to think, there was a good\ndeal of re\u017femblance. Indeed, the Druids are accu\u017fed of human \u017facrifices.\nThey crucified a man and burnt him on the altar; which \u017feems to be a mo\u017ft\nextravagant act of \u017fuper\u017ftition, deriv'd from fome extraordinary notices they\nhad of mankind's redemption: and perhaps from Abraham's example mifun\nder\u017ftood. But as to human \u017facrifices fimply confidered, the Romans them\nfelves and all other nations upon earth at times, pra\u0107tis'd them.\nTo this Hercules, antiquity affixed very many names, from different noti\nons of him, retain\u2019din different countries; and after idolatry took root, he was\nwor\u017fhipp'd under tho\u017fe names of con\u017fecration, according to the old method.\nFor in\u017ftance, one of his names was Palaemon. Palaemon, \u017fays Heffchius, is\nHercules. The Greeks madehim a fea Deity, who had been fo great a \u017fea-cap\ntain. They call him Melicerta, which is his Ph\u00e6nician name Melcartus, king\nof the city. Ovid tells us the \u017ftory in Met. IV. Nonnus calls him Astrochiton\n\u017ftarry-robed, from his being made a con\u017ftellation in heaven. In the Gallic\nf of him, which Lucian \u017faw, he is repre\u017fented with a \u017fphere in one\nand, under the name of Ogmius. Mr. Toland in his history of the Druids,\nfhews us the true interpretation of that word, from the Iri\u017fh language; after the\nlearned had in vain attempted theexplication of it. From thence we infer he\nbrought the u\u017fe of letters hither, Ce\u017far informs us, the Druids had :\nC\n\fXXVIII\n\"I AH\n|\u0160.\n\u00a7\u00c8i\u0160|\nP.54.\n|\nN\n\/|\ni||\nH--\n|\n'\n;:\ni\n|F\n-.\u00a7\u00a7\n--i\ns#\n|-\n|-\n\u00c8~\n;\n:2|\nN|\n\u2022-s\n-\nst\nSs\ns\ns\n----:#\n---\n2\n-3\n-*\nS\n~=\ns-3.:-53----|-::::\n-\n|\n|-s|\n|-\n:\n---\n---\n--.~\ns|\nS\n\u2013--\n:\n-------|--\n-\n*-----\n4--\n--r|\n-|-|\n-\nA*\n<.\n\u00a7s$\n\u00a7\n\u00a7SS\n'\n.\n|4\n|\nJ|\n4\u00b7\n{\/\/\u00ed\n-\n\u1ea4\nr\n%|--\n}\n|\n|\ni\n|\n*\u012f||4|\n||--;-MR--||-|#\n-\n\u00a7to|-gB\n}4\n\/||U\n****|-|-\n|-||-\n||\n|5W\n3|4||-[\n*-v|-|--\n*|||}4\n|-v.}HG;|||-;\n--|-\n;-,\ni.|\u00c8\n\u00a7\nNS\n\u00c8\nS\n|\n'|\n|||\n|-|-}\n||%\n|\n|#\n||\n|\n||\n.|}\n||\n|-|\ns\n\u0160\n\u0160\n\u00bb~\u00a7'\n\"\n\\\n|-\\|\n*\u00bb\n\\s*|\nW\n.\n|-SS\nsS\u00a7\n\u0160*\n|\n----ss\u00a7\nr-sSS\n\u00a7\u00a7\u0160\n|\n\f\fD E s c R I B E D. 55\nHe is called Affis, by the ea\u017fterns, which fignifies the valiant: the fame as Hae\nfus of the Germans.\nBefide the patriarchal custom of building the\u017fe places of wor\u017fhip, and con\nfecrating them with oil, we find many other foot\u017fteps of that mo\u017ft ancient\nreligion, in the hi\u017ftory of Hercules. . Silius \u017fpeaking of the \u017ftrange rites u\u017fed\nin the Gaditan temple of Hercules, fays, the prie\u017fts officiated there barefooted,\npra\u0107tis'd chaftity, had no statues, us'd white linen furplices. And it is a noto\nrious custom with the ancient Ph\u00e6nicians, to pay tithe. Indeed they paid\ntythe to Hercules. Which only imports, that it was a precept and pra\u0107tice\nintroduc'd by Hercules. And after they had deified Hercules they pra\u0107tis'd it\ntoward him. This was a common method, when idolatry began. I \u017fhall\ntreat more largely of the\u017fe affairs; when I di\u017fcour\u017fe expre\u017fily of the patriarchal re\nligion. Likewife, I \u017fhall prove more fully, from chronological chara\u0107ters,\nthat this Hercules liv'd at the time, we are \u017fpeaking of, in the canon Mo\u017faicae\nchronologiae. What I now recite, concerning the\u017fe matters, I could not well\navoid, as they in my apprehen\u017fion, relate to the name of Stonehenge.\nPliny Nat. Hist. VII. 56. gives us a te\u017ftimony, of our Hercules, under the\nname of Melcartus, (as Bochart rightly corre\u0107ts it) fir\u017ft bringing tin into\nGreece, from the Caffiteridiflands. By which the Briti\u017fh are meant. The tin\nof Tyre, which the merchants of Greece, came to buy, at the fairs of that ci\nty, is mention'd Ezekiel xxvii. 12. which, no doubt, came from hence. But\nit is much earlier mention'd, among lead and other metals, when the Midia\nnites had it in Mo\u017fes's time, Numbers xxxi. 22. the Chaldee and Arabic verfion\nthere, u\u017fe the word kastira, the Hiero\u017folymitan kistara. No wonder the Mi\ndianites \u017fhould then abound with tin: when we were told by fof phus, that\nApher \u017fon of Midian, was one of Hercules's companions. The LXX. in\nthat pa\u017f\u017fage of Numbers call it (zsi-eos. But tin is mention'd earlier still, in\njob xix. 24. and fob liv'd in this fame country, on the borders of Arabia.\nIt is very evident from Bochart, that the Ph\u00e6nicians, had fail'd quite round\nBritain, by what he writes of Thule. How then can we doubt but the great\n\u012fland, which they found in the extreme\u017ft we\u017ft, was Britain? but they kept\ntheir gainful navigation hither fo \u017fecret, for many centuries, that even Herodo\ntus the earlieft Greek writer profe\u017f\u017fes he knows not, whence the tin comes.\nBritain was the only country, where it could come from, in any quantity, as\nPliny fays. But from this great \u017fecrecy of the Phanicians, we have lo\u017ft the\nhigh antiquities of Britain, as unknown to the Greeks ; the only heathen na\ntion that had the addre\u017fs to commit things to writing. Therefore we mu\u017ft be\ncontent with what \u017fmall remains of this kind, can be fi\u017fh'd out of the wreck\nof time, by fuch conje\u0107tural methods, as antiquaries cannot avoid infifting\nOI).\nIn Devon\u017fhire is Hartland point fo call'd corruptly, asthe excellent Camden\nob\u017ferves, for Herculis promontorium. And upon the Durham fea coa\u017ft is a\ntown on a promontory call'd Hartlepool. A village call'd Hart near it. I take\nit to have been call'd by the Greek traders here Heracleopolis. And hence, pro\nbably came that fine old altar in Greek, dedicated to the TyrianHercules, which\nMr. Roger Galeand I copied, in Corbridge church-yard.\nFrom the\u017fe and many other confiderations of this kind, which I \u017fhall here\nafter treat of more largely and profe\u017f\u017fedly: I cannot but join in opinion with\nFranc. Philelphus in his epi\u017ftles, and Lilius Giraldus in his Hercules mention'd\nby Mr. Camden, in thela\u017ft quoted pa\u017f\u017fage, and with many other writers, thatthe\nvery ancient Ph\u00e6nician or Tyrian Hercules condu\u0107ted an ea\u017ftern colony hither;\nup\u00f3nthe aborigines; withwhom camethe Druids, the buildersofStonebenge and\nthe like works among us.

XII. -\nA conjesture about the time of the founding of Stonehenge,\nAn uniform variation in fetting the\u017fe works, not to be accounted\nfor, but by \u017fuppo\u017fing the Druids us'd a magnetical compa\/s.\nTheir leader, the Tyrian Hercules, was poffe\/s'd of a compg\/s\nbox. The oracle of Jupiter Ammon had a compa\u00df-box. The\ngolden fleece at Colchis was a compa\/s-box. Both the\u017fe temples\nwerefounded by Apher, Hercules his companion, and grand\/on\nto Abraham. Apher, Aphricus, or Phryxus the fame per\u017fon,\n&ems to have given name to Britain. The Druids \/et their tem\nples and other works by it. The history of the mariner's compa\/s,\nJince thattime. The history ofthe variationofthemagnetic needle.\nA conje\u010d\u017eure of the time of building Stonehenge, from thence.\nN my Enquiries into the\u017fe works of the antient Druids in our i\u017fland, I ob\nI ferved a greater exa\u0107tne\u017fs in placing them, with regard to the quarters of\nthe heavens, than one would expe\u0107t, in works \u017feemingly fo rude; and in fo re\nmote an age, to which we mu\u017ft nece\u017f\u017farily refer them. What more particular\nly mov'd my attention, was a certain variation from cardinal points, which I\nob\u017ferved regular and uniform, in the works of one place. And that variation\nwas different, in works of another place; yet equally regular and uniform in\nthat place. Suppo\u017fe (for in\u017ftance) the works about Abury in Wilt\u017fhire gene\nrally vary 9 or 1o degrees to the left hand, from cardinal points: i. e. we\u017ftward\nfrom the north. And the worksat Stonehenge generally vary to the right hand,\nfrom cardinal points, and that to the quantity of 6 or 7 degrees. The principal\ndiameter or groundline of Stonehenge, leading from the entrance, up the middle\nof the temple, to the high altar, (from which line the whole work is form\u2019d)\nvaries about that quantity fouthward of the north ea\u017ft point. The intent ofthe\nfounders of Stonehenge, was to fet the entrance full north east, being the point\nwhere the fun ri\u017fes, or nearly, at the fummer fol\u017ftice. As well becau\u017fe that\nis the fartheft elongation of the great cele\u017ftial luminary, northward; the com\nplement of our earthly felicity, in ripening the fruits of the earth : as becau\u017fe\n.then they celebrated one of their principal religious meetings or fe\u017ftivals, with\nfacrifices, publick games, and the like. Such was the cu\u017ftom of all the antient\nnations. The Isthmian, Nem\u00e6an, Pythian games, famous in the\nworks of the learned nations: tho\u017fe of Tyre II. Maccabees iv. 18. dedicated to\ntheir and our founder, the antient Tyrian Hercules, who, I \u017fuppo\u017fe, condu\u0107ted\nthe fir\u017ft Ph\u00e6nician colony, with our Druids, into Britain: the\u017fe were all held\nat this time of the year. A cu\u017ftom continu'd from patriarchal times. *\nThis exa\u0107tne\u017fs with which the Druids fet their works, and the uniformit\nof their variation, make me believe, this variation was not the effe\u0107t of chance\nor negligence.\nBy a \u017fuperficial reflexion upon it, we \u017fhould be apt to \u017fu\u017fpect, it was owing\nto their ob\u017ferving the fun's rifing on the longe\u017ft day of the year, or \u017fummer \u017fol\nftice, and fetting their line by it. For this is \u017fuppo\u017fed to be a method by which\nthey formerly fet our Churches: marking the fun's rifing at the equinox. But\nthe Druids were too good a\u017ftronomers and mathematicians to need fo mean an\nartifice: nor does it corre\u017fpond to the quantity preci\u017fely enough. Befides, this\nfame variation appears where it cannot po\u017fibly regard the fun's rifing, at that\ntime,\n- - For,\n\f\u00ab\n|\n|\n$\n:\n6.

At the bottom of the hill, this avenue divides into two wings,\neach going off from the la\u017ft mention'd part, with a decent \u017fweep; the one to\nthe left hand, we\u017ftward, the other to the right hand, ea\u017ftward. They go off\nwith a like angle, and that angle varies the like quantity. The western wing\ngoes to the cur\u017fus, before ob\u017ferv'd, the place upon the downs, half a mile off\nStonehenge, made for races with chariots and hor\u017fes. The right hand wing of\nthe avenne runs dire\u0107tly ea\u017ftward for a mile together, pointing to a place on an\nangle of the river, called Radfin. This part of the avenue, which was intend\ned by the founders, to have been drawn preci\u017fely ea\u017ft and we\u017ft, varies about 5\nor 6 degrees to the fouth.\nLikewife, that great work of the cur\u017fus it\u017felf, which stretches its length a\ncro\u017fs the downs, from ea\u017ft to we\u017ft, like a line of latitude upon the globe, varies\nfuch a like quantity, from true ea\u017ft and we\u017ft, the fame way. The meridian :\nline of Stonehenge paffes exa\u0107tly through the middle of this cur\u017fus.\nFurther, at the ea\u017ft end of this curf\u00fcs, the huge bank of earth, above 2oo\nfoot long, made acro\u017fs the end of the cur\u017fus, as a meta, and whereon fat the\nprinces andjudges of the prizes: This bank of earth is drawn exa\u0107tly at a right\nangle with the cur\u017fus, con\u017fequently due north and \u017fouth, but with the variati\non before \u017fpoken of The\u017fe, and other like ob\u017fervations here, as well as in o\nther Druid Works, appear'd to me no otherwi\u017fe to be accounted for, but that\nthe Druids us'd a magnetical compa\u017fs, in laying down the works: and that the\nneedle vary'd fo much, at that time, from the true meridian line.\nI remember I open'd this affair, near 2o Years ago, to Dr. Halley, who was\nof the fame fentiment. Nor am I the fir\u017ft who fufpe\u0107ted the Ph\u00e6nicians of\nold were po\u017fleffed of this great \u017fecret, as well as the Chine\u017fe, from times imme\nmorial. I am not moved to think otherwi\u017fe by what Bochart writes again\u017ft it.\nThe very name of the magnet lapis Heraclius \u017ftrongly \u017fugge\u017fts, the Tyrian na\nvigator before-mention'd knew it, as is well argued by Fuller in his Mi\u017fcella\nnies, IV. 19. And many things occur, in the mythology of the antients,\nwherein (if I mi\u017ftake not) I di\u017fcern mo\u017ft evident traces of this knowledge of\nthe dire\u0107tive power of the magnet. We are not to de\u017fpi\u017fe the fables of the an\ntients, but to make the be\u017ft u\u017fe of them, and \u017fearch out for their latent truths.\nMy predece\u017f\u017for Cumberland, ob\u017ferves in Sanchoniathon, p. 325. \u201c that Apol\n\u201c lodorus (for in\u017ftance) hath many truths in his mythic hi\u017ftory, deriv'd from the\n\u201c tradition of Ph\u00e6nicians and Egyptians, planting Athens.\u201d And the Greeks,\ntho\u017fe happy pra\u0107titioners in writing, as well as other arts, took the unlucky\nturn of the marvellous, to fo exorbitant a degree, as to write nothing without it.\nIn Apollodorus, put out by the learned Dr. Gale, p. I 14, we have an ac\ncount of the 1oth labour of Hercules, his conque\u017ft of Cadiz, or Gadira, as\nthen call'd, or Erythea. We are told, the hero fet up the 2 pillars at the\nStreights mouth, at Gibralter, or then Tarteffus; which we may rea\u017fonably\nfuppo\u017fe fome temple made of the\u017fe rough ftones, or fome main ambres, like\ntho\u017fe we mention'd before, the petr\u00e6 ambro\u017fiae in the Tyrian coins. Then,\n\u201c \u017fays our author, going on his journey, the rays of the fun were \u017fo vehement\n\u201c upon him, that he had the boldne\u017fs to draw his bow again\u017ft him. The\n\u201c god admiring the intrepidity of the man, gave him a golden cup with which\n\u201c he fail'd over the ocean.\u201d . Pi\u017fander in his Ild. book, (in Atheneus Deipno\/\nXI.) writes the fame, only that Oceanus lent him the cup. Panyafis in his I.\nof the hi\u017ftory of Hercules, \u017fays, he begg'd it of Nereus, fon of Sol, and with it\nfail'd to Erythea. (Macrob. Saturn XXI. 5.) Theoclytus, in Atheneus afore\nfaid, in his II. de tempest. mentions the fame thing. He faid it before in his Ti\ntanomachia. Pherecydes, in his III. of history, quoted both in Atheneus and\nMacrobius, tells a \u017ftory fomewhat like that of Apollodorus, but more particular.\nQ\u2013 Servius\n\f58 S 7 O N E H E N G E\nServius \u00c6n. VII. mentions it, but as fome of the former, makes the cup ofbra\u017fs,\nin\u017ftead of gold. Alexander Ephe\u017fius the like. All very antient writers. Lu\ncian \u017fays, that Hercules fail'd in a \u017fea-conch \u017fhell. What can we understand\nby all this, mention'd by fo many grave authors, but a compa\u017fs-box,which ena\nbled him to fail the great ocean, and penetrate to our northern i\u017fland, le\u017fs ob\nnoxious to the funs vehement heat? Add to this, in the fame place, Apollodo\nrus \u017fpeaks of his fighting Albion and Dercynus, by Mela, called Bergion, Sons\nof Neptune; which were the mo\u017ft antient names of the Britannic I\u017fles, before\nthe name of Britain. Diodorus Siculus, in his IV. book delivers a like account\nof this Ioth labour of Hercules, but in a mere hi\u017ftorical manner. And adds, that\nwhen he return'd by Sicily, he dedicated a grove to Geryon the hero, where,\nto his time, the people did religious rites. For this affair of facred groves, we\nknow our Druids were famous. He built a temple likewi\u017fe at Gades. We are\nnot to \u017fuppo\u017fe it a cover'd edifice, like what po\u017fterity call'd a temple, but an\nopen one, according to the mode of tho\u017fe days. Cover'd temples, at that time,\nbeing a thing unknown in the world. Afterward, a magnificent temple, pro\nperly, was there built to him. Mela witne\u017f\u017fes, that it was our Egyptian Her\ncules, who was there wor\u017fhipped. For I \u017fuppo\u017fe our Egyptian and the Tyrian\nHercules to be all one. The fame mention'd by the name of Affis, in Mane\nthons XVII. Dynasty, in fof phus c. App. in Africanus, Eu\u017f\u00e8bivs, and Syncellus.\nApollonius II. 14. writes, it was not the Theban but the Egyptian Hercules that\ncame to Gades: which is confirm\u2019d by Hecateus. And Herodotus, in Euterpe\nfays, Hercules is a very antient deity among the Egyptians, not fo, among the\nGreeks. And I \u017fuppo\u017fe this hero lived at, or very near the time of the patri\narch Abraham. - -\nThe\u017fe were the times about the beginning of idolatry. And Hercules was\nfar from being an idolater him\u017felf, though wor\u017fhipp'd afterwards, for his great\nexploits, and perhaps on this very account of his inventing or knowing the u\u017fe\nof the compa\u017fs. This is the Hercules kneeling on one knee, a con\u017ftellation in\nheaven, taken notice of by Diony\u017fius Halycarn. by Tzetzes, Hyginus, \u00c6sthylus\nand others. It \u017feems to indicate his piety; for which the astronomers his dif\nciples plac'd him in the heavens. He kneels upon the ar\u0107tic circle, and \u017fup\nports the zodiac on his \u017fhoulders; tho' this is not under\u017ftood by the painting\non our modern globes.

There is no room to doubt, that this\nis in part copied from the tran\u017faction of the children of I\u017frael, in the Arabian\nwilderne\u017fs. They have added to it, a name and notion borrowed from patri\narchal tradition, of a divine perfon, \u017fymboliz'd by a ram; horned, anointed,\nwhich is all one. We chri\u017ftians mean Meffiab. Innumerable pafages in old\nauthors, which I might cite, innumerable monuments of antiquity in \u017fculp\nture, \u017fhew, that fupiter Ammon was figur'd as a ram, with a ram's head,\nwith rams horns. They applied the patriarchal notion of the Mffiah, to their\nprogenitor Ham, in an idolatrous way: and deified him under that chara\u0107ter.\nThere is a very remarkable pa\u017f\u017fage in Herodotus, which, it is worth our while,\nto tran\u017fcribe.\nIn Euterpe cap. 42. that author tells us, why the Theban Egyptians pay fo\ngreat a regard to the \u017fheep. \u201c Hercules on his importunity to fupiter,\n\u201c that he might have the honour per\u017fonally to fee him, at length prevail'd.\nAnd the god confented to exhibit him\u017felf to his view, under this device.\nviz. fupiter cut off a ram's head, put the \u017fkin over his own head, and thus\nappear'd to Hercules. Whence the Egyptians made the \u017ftatue of fupiter,\nwith a ram's head, and call fupiter Amm\u00f3un. Whence they hold \u017fheep\nfor \u017facred animals, never kill them but once a year, upon the fe\u017ftival day of\nYupiter, when only one ram is \u017facrificed, and his head put upon the \u017ftatue\nof futiter ; all that are there pre\u017fent, beat the ram, and at la\u017ft he is buried\nin a \u017facred urn.\u201d\nIt is impo\u017fible not to fee, that this is derived from that hi\u017ftory recorded,\nExodus xxxiii. Mo\u017f\u00e8s defires of \u0159ehovah repeatedly, that he might fee him.\nHe calls it \u017feeing his glory. He is an\u017fwer\u2019d at length. \u201c I will make all my\n\u201c goodne\/s pa\u017fs before thee, and I will proclaim the name of Yehovah before\n\u201c thee. Thou canft not fee my face, but I will put thee in a cleft of the\n\u201c rock, and cover thee with my hand, whil\u017ft I pa\u017fs by. Thou \u017fhalt fee my\n\u201c back parts only.\u201d Here he notoriou\u017fly promifes Mo\u017f\u00e8s, that he \u017fhall fee him,\nin a \u017fymbolical form. In the next chapter, Jehovah de\u017fcended in the lumi\nnous cloud, or Shechinah, and proclaimed the name of fehovah; recites\ntho\u017fe attributes that relate to his dealings with mankind, in the \u017ftronge\u017ft\npoint of light; \u201c his goodne\u017fs and mercy, and long-\u017fuffering, forgiving ini\n\u201c quity, tran\u017fgreflion and fin : but adds, he will by no means clear the guilty,\n\u201c but vifit the fathers iniquity upon the children.\u201d Wherein our original and\nfatal tran\u017fgre\u017fiion is \u017fufficiently intimated, and that God's ju\u017ftice is equal to his\nmercy; and the nece\u017fity of a divine redemption by \u017facrifice, which in \u017fcri\nture language is call'd, \u201c the lamb flain from the foundation of the world.\u201d\nAll this the mo\u017ft ancient nations had a knowledge of, from patriar\nchal tradition. When they laps'd into idolatry, they applied the\u017fe good noti\nons to their new idolatry, and made \u017ftatues from the \u017fymbolical and figurative\nforms of \u017fpeech, us'd in true religion. Their \u017facrificing the ram on the fe\u017fti\nval day of fupiter, their beating the ram, putting his head on the \u017ftatue of\ntheir deity, burying him in a \u017facred urn: all mo\u017ft evidently pointing out the\nnotions they had, in the mo\u017ft early times, of the \u017fuffering \u017ftate of the Meffiah.\nAnd \u017fuch was the origin, in \u017fhort, of fupiter Ammon. But it appears, by\nwhat learned authors write, on Curtius's de\u017fcription of his statue, that a mag\nnetical compa\u017fs box made one confiderable part of his \u017facreds. This we read\nin Hyde Perf. relig. p. 495. in Curtius publi\u017fh\u2019d by Piti\u017fcus, and by Rader\nthe je\u017fuite, and Schottus in Ortelius, by Fuller, Herwart and others. \u201c This\n\u201c compa\u017fs box with the \u017ftatue of the deity, was fet in a golden \u017fhip\n\u201c (the golden cup of Hercules) and carried in procestion on the \u017fhoul\n\u201c ders of the prie\u017fts, accompanied by women finging an hymn in their\nC C\nC C\nC (\n\u00ab C\nC C\nC C\nC C\n* \u00ab\n\u201c own language.\u201d I doubt not, but the circum\u017ftance of carrying this gol\nden \u017fhip, on the \u017fhoulders of the prie\u017fts, is an imitation of the Mo\u017f\u00e0ic ark in\nthe march of the I\u017fraelites, thro' the wilderne\u017fs, during their forty years pil\ngrimage.\n\f6o J' 7' 0 N E H E N G E\ngrimage. Tho' they mi\u017ftook the rea\u017fon of the thing; the fewi\u017fh church then\nbeing in a military and travelling \u017ftate. But where the camp re\u017fted, the ark\nwas repo\u017fited, in the adytum of the tabernacle: fo likewife when in poffesti\non of the land of Canaan. This is \u017fufficient proof, that the Lybians here\nin, copied after the I\u017fraelites, not vice verfa, as our moderns are willing to\nthink, in the\u017fe ca\u017fes.\nCurtius tells us, the habit of Ammon's \u017ftatue was made of Smaragd and\nother precious \u017ftones, wrought in Mo\u017faic work. Which I take to be too, in\nimitation of the pontifical attire, under Mo\u017fes's admini\u017ftration: particularly of\nthe \u017facred, oracular pe\u0107toral, made of Mo\u017faic work, with gems. I appre\nhend, that befide the statue of Ammon, there was a figure of (the upper part at\nlea\u017ft of) a ram, on the compa\u017fs box: which was the oracle. And it is ea\u017fy to\ngue\u017fs how this may be managed for the purpo\u017fe; even beyond the trick of\nfanuarius's blood, and other Popi\u017fh devices.\nHence we may better under\u017ftand the famous golden fleece, which occa\u017fion\ned the Argonautic expedition, one of the earlie\u017ft and mo\u017ft memorable \u00c6ra's\nof the Grecian hi\u017ftory. If we \u017fuppo\u017fe this golden fleece to be a compa\u017fs box,\nwe \u017fee the rea\u017fon why the choice youth of Greece fet out upon that voyage:\nwhich, as all other matters of ancient hi\u017ftory, among the Greeks, is fo unac\ncountably puft up with the leaven of fable. It became navigators to run any\nhazard for \u017fuch a trea\u017fure. If we enquire into its origin, it is thus. Phrixus\nfon of Athamas and Nepheles (according to the Greeks) had a \u017fhip given him\nby his mother. The \u017fhip is call'd in the fable a golden ram, or the ram with\na golden fleece (the fame thing as Hercules's golden cup.) In this, he and his\nfifter Helle, flying the ill-ufage of their mother-in-law Ino, fail away by fea.\nHelle affrighted in the voyage, falls overboard and gives name to the Helle\u017fpont.\nPhrixus continues the voyage, and goes to \u00c6etes king of Colchis, where he\nhangs up his golden ram in the temple, to fupiter Phyxius, (one would be\napt to imagine they meant Pyxius, alluding to the box.) fa\u017fon made his far\nfam'd expedition thither afterward, and \u017ftole it. But the ram was placed in\nthe heavens, among the con\u017ftellations, as a mcmorial; the fir\u017ft fign in the Zo\ndiac: which \u017fhews the high antiquity of the \u017ftory.\nThis account manife\u017ftly pretends very great antiquity, and fome fignal\nevent. I ob\u017ferve this Imo their mother-in-law, is faid to be the nurfe of Bac\nchus, and throwing her\u017felf with her \u017fon Melicerte into the fea, became a god\nde\u017fs, under the name of Leucothea. Her fon became a god, under the name\nof Palaemon. This Melicerte is allowed by all the learned, to be no other than\nour Melcartus above-mention'd. Pal\u00e6mon is Hercules, fays Hel\u00fdchius. . Pa\nl\u00e6mon is his name of deification. Paufanias in the beginning of his corinthi\naca informs us, this apotheofis of Ino and Melicerta was the occafion offounding\nthe famous Isthmiangames. Plutarch faysthe fame, and Phavorinus. Again,\nI ob\u017ferve, Phrixus is faid to be fon of Nephele (a cloud) whence call'd nubige\nna by Columella. We mu\u017ft hence expe\u0107t \u017fomewhat very \u017fecret and ob\u017fcure.\nFurther, all writers \u017fay openly this ram or \u017fhip of Phrixus was oracular and\ncould \u017fpeak upon occafion. So all the writers of the Argonautics too will\nhave the \u017fhip Argos to be loquacious and oracular. Magnes another name of\nthe load-\u017ftone is often call'd Adamas, which \u017feems to be no other than Atha\nmas. Apollodorus makes Magnes the fon of \u00c6olus, who marrying Nais, inha\nbited the i\u017fle Seriphus. \u00c6olus was a great failor, invented fails, and \u017ftudied\nthe winds, therefore deified and made the god of the winds. I \u017fuppo\u017fe it all\nends in the my\u017fterious invelopement of the knowledge of the magnetic com\na\u017fs.\nP I hope for the readers candour, in reciting thus much from antient fable,\nwhich I did as conci\u017fely as po\u017f\u017fible. But in matters of ob\u017fcure antiquity, we\nmu\u017ft make u\u017fe of all helps. And in heathen antiquity we have no other.

And what is remarkable, after God's holy fpirithad\ndeferted them, their writers became the greate\u017ft fablers in the world, and, if\npo\u017f\u017fible, out-did the Greeks, in that way.\nOne would imagine, the fa\u017fhion of the\u017fe mo\u017ft antient charts, was to divide\nthe circle into 12 parts, and affix the cele\u017ftial figns of the zodiac to them; be\nginning with the ea\u017ft at aries, where the fun rifes at the equinoxes; and thence\nthey might call the box by the name of aries, as fhewing the ea\u017ft where aries\nis plac'd. As now the Turks and Arabians call it kibla noma, i. e. \u017fhewing\nthe kibla, or fouth point, the way toward which they turn their faces in devo\ntion. So we only enquire for the north point; and call it the lode-\u017ftone, be\ncau\u017fe it fhews the lode-\u017ftar or north pole. But'tis all one; any one point in a\ncircle being found, the re\u017ft are found too.\nFrom what has been \u017faid, it \u017feems probable, that the fable of the hero find\ning out the \u017fpring in the fandy defarts of Africa, by the help of a ram fent from\nfupiter, means the travelling over tho\u017fe immen\u017fe plains by the help ofa com\nafs, which they call'd by the name ofa ram, or a golden ram. And that the\nofe\u017f\u017fors of the antient oracle of Ammon had fuch a \u017fecret, which they cun\nningly applied to the \u017facreds of their deity. Probably, in that mo\u017ft early age,\nthey had not improv'd the u\u017fe of it to the pitch and manner that we enjoy, with\na needle; and that fet upon a central pin: but having found out the verticity of\nthe magnet, they put it into a boat, which was to \u017fwim on water, and therein\nit would have liberty to turn it\u017felf to its proper dire\u0107tion. And this is the fen\ntiment of the learned Dr. Wallis, in the Philo\u017fophical Tranf\u00e0\u00e9fions, No. 278.\nThis boat was the better a handle for the mythologi\u017fts to call Hercules's veffel a\ngolden cup, becau\u017fe cups were made in the \u017fhape of a boat, and had the fame\ndenomination, cymbium.\nTho\u017fe learned commentators upon Curtius abovementioned agree, there\nwas a \u017ftone along with the \u017ftatue of Ammon, carried about in the golden\nfhip; and perhaps, hence the antient navigators took the hint of applying the\nfigure of the ram to their compa\u017f\u017fes, however form'd, and gave it the name of\nthe ram, or golden fleece, which the Greek fables, their mo\u017ft antient hi\u017ftory,\nring of: and hence their fhips deriv'd their oracular quality. Phrixus's \u017fhip,\nthe golden ram, being faid to \u017fpeak on occafion, as well as the \u017fhip argos. The\nftupendous properties of this \u017ftone, without difficulty, would per\u017fuade even\ntho\u017fe above the vulgar, that there was a divine principle in it, quite metaphy\nfical, con\u017fequently oracular. And in the dawnings of idolatry, the evil agent\nwho was vigilant to pervert every thing to his own purpo\u017fe, would not fail to\nmake great u\u017fe of the \u017fecrets of the magnet. The intire notion of oracles a\nmong the heathen, is cau\u017fed by the devil's mimickry of God's tran\u017fa\u0107tions a\nmong the patriarchs and the fews. But I believe the Egyptians took their no\ntion of carrying a boat in all their religious proceflions, from this magnetic boat,\nof which both Herodotus and Plutarch inform us. For they intended it to fig\nnify the movement and de\u017fcent of the divine ideas from the \u017fupreme mind; e\nfpecially the very fountain and principal of tho\u017fe ideas: and it mu\u017ft be own'd\nto be admirably well chofe. Hence the top and the bottom of the verge or\nlimbus of the celebrated I\/iac table, is adorn'd with a boat. In one a ram, in\nthe other a bull. Meaning the origin of the chain of ideas flowing from the\ndivine mind. \u2019Tis highly probable, that with the ram is the copy of fupiter\nAmmon's boat, mention'd by Curtius. And I \u017fuppo\u017fe this is Herwart's opini\non, but I have not yet \u017feen his book. Of this I \u017fhall di\u017fcour\u017fe larger in my\nexplication of the Bembin table. However Herodotus tells us in his II. book,\nthat the temple of fupiter Ammon took its rife from Ph\u00e6nicia. I only men\ntion this for the fake of tho\u017fe that are over a\u0107ting the credit of antiquities in\nEgypt.\nlearn in Plutarch's di\u017fcour\u017fe de Ifid. & O\u017fir, that the \u017fhip argos of the\nGreeks, was in reality the \u017fhip that our Hercules fail'd round the world in.\nR Further,\n\f62 s 7' 0 N E H E N G E\nFurther, this oracular \u017fhip has its name argos, fays my friend Mr. Baxter, giff.\nant. rom. from the Hebrew and Syrian word argan, an ark. Which confirms\nwhat I faid above, concerning the carrying about the \u017fhip of Ammon on the\nfhoulders of the prie\u017fts. Strabo in II. of his geography, mentions the temple\nof Leucothea, built by Phrixus at Colchos ; that there was an oracle there; and\nthat the \u017fheep was never flain at the place. This fhews its relation to that of\nfupiter Ammon. Leucothea is the name of con\u017fecration of Hercules his mother,\nHercules him\u017felf being call'd Palaemon; both made \u017fea deities: from the ex\ntraordinary fame of Hercules, the fir\u017ft and great fea captain. Pau\u017f\u00e0nias in Af\nticis \u017fays, he was buried in the Corinthian Isthmus; where the Isthmian games\nwere kept to his memory. But Mela writes, that his remains were at Gades.\nIt's probable there was only an honorary monument of him at the Isthmus, as\nfounder: as the honorary monument of folaus mention'd to be among the The\n#ans, by the Stadium, p. 42.\nMr. Baxter in gloff. ant. rom. v. af\u010bania makes Phrixus to be Aphricus, and\nthe fame per\u017fon as fupiter Ammon, or thefounder ofthe temple of fupiter Am\nmon; rather, of that prior to fupiter Ammon. We are not to regard the little\nartificesof the Greeks, who draw all celebrated events and per\u017fons of antiquity,\ninto their own country. Apbricus, no doubt, is the Aphre before-mentioned,\nfon of Midian, fon of Abraham; whom Cleodemus makes an a\u017f\u017fociate of Her\ncules, in his Lybian wars. fo\u017fephus makes him the conqueror of Lybia, and\nthat he gave name to Africa. \"Tis not unlikely but that he is the hero that tra\nvell'd over the\u017fe barren \u017fands by the help of the compa\u017fs, as hiscountrymen the\nArabians have from times immemorial pra\u0107tifed, in travelling over their own\ndefarts. And might probably ere\u0107t a patriarchal temple there; and in times of\nhis posterity it degenerated into the idolatrous temple of fupiter Ammon. And\nthere the compa\u017fs box of the hero remain'd, and was converted into part of the\nheathen \u017facreds.\n\"Tis no very \u017ftrange matter, if they at another time call this fame her\u00f3 Bac\nchus, therein confounding him with the like travels of the I\u017fraelites, through\nthe Arabian defarts. We are not to expe\u0107t the\u017fe hi\u017ftories of old times involv'd\nin fable, ab\u017folutely confi\u017ftent. But if this account be agreeable to truth or near\nit; then we may imagine the fame Aphre, by the Greeks call'd Phrixus, accord\ning to Mr. Baxter, pa\u017fs'd the Helle\u017fpont, made the expedition into Colchis, and\nbuilt a likc templc there. And a compa\u017fs box called the golden ram, was made\nalike part ofthe obje\u0107t of their adoration. This is exceedingly confirm\u2019d by\nthereport of Herodotus and Diodorus S. who \u017fay, the Colchi pra\u0107ti\u017fed the rite of\ncircumcifion, a matter which the learned cannot account for; but appears plain\nfrom hence: the\u017fe being the de\u017fcendants of Abraham. They \u017fay, at the fame\ntime, that the Ethiopians pra\u0107ti\u017fe the like: and that 'tis no recent cu\u017ftom a\nmong them, but from the beginning. . I apprehend by Ethiopians are meant A\nrabians, who are people de\u017fcended from Abraham. Herodotus \u017fays likewife\nthe Egyptians circumcis'd, which mu\u017ft be accounted for in this fame manner;\nfome Arabian or Ethiopian nation bringing the cu\u017ftom among them. As a\nfurther confirmation of Phrixus being Aphricus, Bochart fhews the Colchic and\nHebrew tongue is much a-kin. And thus we may account for what Mr. Toland,\np. 133; \u017fays, that the idiom ofthe Iri\u017fh language (which we \u017fuppo\u017fe the rem\nnant of the mo\u017ft antient oriental,) has a mixture of Arabic in it.\nI \u017faw a book in Dr. Mead's library, Mu\u017feo de las medallas de\u017fconocidas E\u017fpa\nnolas, p. 35.

I veri\nly believe this is our Aphra, or Apher in our Engli\u017fh tran\u017flation call'd Epher,\nGen. xxv. 4. ftruck by fome city in Spain, who acknowledged him their founder.\nIt is remarkable enough, what Mr. Norden writes, in his hi\u017ftory of Corn\nwall. The Corni\u017fh men univer\u017fally \u017fuppo\u017fe that the fews are the people who\nfir\u017ft work't in their rocks, for tin: and in old negle\u0107ted tin-works, they find\nfome of their tools. , The workmen call them attal farazin, the fews ca\u017ft off\nworks, in their Hebrew \u017fpeech, \u017fays Norden. Now I apprehend he means\nour Arabians: and it is a circum\u017ftance confirming the former notions. And\nto it we may refer the origin of the odd reports, of our Stonehenge coming from\nAfrica and the like. By the Greeks, Hercules Melcartus or Melicerta, and\nPhrixus or Apricus are made halfbrothers: by fo\u017fephus, Hercules is fon-in-law\nto Aphricus. The Ph\u00e6nicians paid tythe. So the Arabians, in Pliny, the\nlike: being patriarchal cu\u017ftoms.\nAphricus or Phryxus we may very well \u017fuppo\u017fe to be father of the Phrygians.\nAnd his expedition thro' the propontis to the Euxine fea, the Greeks colour\nover with their Helle and Helle\u017fpont. But we cannot entertain too high a re\nfpe\u0107t for him, becau\u017fe I fee it no le\u017fs rea\u017fonable, to refer the origin of the Bri\ntons to him. I mean that ea\u017ftern colony that came hither with Hercules, upon\nthe old po\u017f\u017fe\u017ffors or aborigines Albionites, which gave the more famous name of\nBritainto the i\u017fland. The Brigantes is the fame name, \u017fays Mr. Baxter the com\nmon and more ancient name of this people: who being driven northwards by\ninundations of foreigners from the continent in after times, the name became\nmore appropriate to the inhabitants of York\u017fhire and the neighbouring counties.\nIn Tacitus the Brigantes are called maxima Brittanorum natio. At the fame\ntime they forc'd the anciente\u017ft poffe\u017ffors, the Albionites or Albanians \u017ftill more\nnorthwards. Likewife many of the\u017fe Brigantes pa\u017fs'd into Ireland, where\nthey became a famous nation. The Bryges, Phryges, Phrixi, Bristnes, Bri\ngantes, Britones are intirely \u017fynonimous words in different diale\u0107ts. And this\naffignment of the origin of our ance\u017ftors, very well accounts for that notion\nof their Phrygian or Trojan de\u017fcent, fo riveted in the minds of the old Britons.\nA notion which prevail'd among fome of the Gallic nations on the continent,\nand they had retain'd the memory of it, in the time of Ammianus Marcelli\nnus, who mentions it. Likewife in Cae\u017far's time, fome Gallic nations, claim\ned kindred with the Romans; probably upon this very account.\nThis is, in \u017fhort, fome pre\u017fumptive evidence we have, of Hercules and\nAphricus planting Britain, introducing the Druidswith the patriarchal religion:\nand concerningthe knowledge they had of the u\u017fe of the compa\u017fs. This whole\nmatter will be further confidered, when I come to treat of it exprefily. At\npre\u017fent we will continue the hi\u017ftory of the compa\u017fs, as it became more fully\nknown to the world.\nMartinius in his Atlas, and Gilbertus de magnete, Lib. I. 2. \u017fhow us, the\nChine\u017f\u00ea have us'd the magnetic needle from times immemorial: that they have\na trick of telling fortunes with it: as the heathen afore-mentioned made it\noracular. The Arabians likewi\u017fe have us'd it, for travelling over the great\nand wild defarts, of weeks together, where there is no track to guide\nthem; nor have they any notion of time when they began this pra\u0107tice.\nHerwartius publi\u017fhed admiranda ethnicae theologiae, wherein he endeavours\nto prove that the old Egyptians had the u\u017fe of the magnetic needle,\nand that the Bembin table contains the do\u0107trine of it, invelop'd in hierogly\nphicks. The learned Fuller in his Mistellanies Lib. 4. 19. afferts, that the\nPh\u00e6nicians knew the u\u017fe of it, which they endeavour'd to conceal by all po\u017f\nfible means, as they did their trading in general. That it was loft with them,\nas many other arts, their ars plumaria, the dying of purple, (the invention of\nour Hercules of Tyre) the Hebrew poetry, and other curious knowledge, which\nis peri\u017fhed.

Thelearned Burman fhews, that mo\u017ft,orall oftheold MSS. and\nprinted books, read it acuncula, acucula, or acungula; which, in my opinion,\nthe criticks have caufele\u017fly corre\u0107ted into icuncula: becau\u017fe they had no notion\nof the magnetic needle being under\u017ftood by it.\nMonfieur Fauchet, a famous French antiquary, in his antiquities of France,\nquoies fome ver\u017fes from a poet in that country, who wrote A. D. I 18o. where\nin is as plain a de\u017fcription of the mariner's box, as words can make. The poet\nmentions it by accident, not as a thing new and \u017ftrange. Q\/orius in his dif\ncour\u017fe of the a\u0107ts of king Emanuel, refers the u\u017fe of the compa\u017fs among the\nEuropeans, to Gama and the Portugue\u017fe, who found it among fome barbarous\npyrates, about the Cape of Good Hope ; who probably were fome remains of\nthe old Ph\u00e6nicians, or Arabians, or at leaft have preferved from them, this\npra\u0107tice. About A. D. 126o. Paulus Venetus is faid to have brought it from\nChina; by the great author on the magnet, our countryman Gilbert.

I ob\u017ferve our ancient Britons, the Wel\u017fh, call a\nfteers-man or pilot llywydd, whence no doubt comes our Engli\u017fh word lode\nftone, and lode-\u017ftar, the north-pole. Llyw is the helm of a \u017fhip in Briti\/h.\nLodemanage in Skinner's etymology an old Engli\u017fh word, \u017fignifying the price\npaid to the pilot. Our lords of the Cinque Ports keep a court at Dover, by\nthat name. The\u017fe things \u017feem to indicate fome memorial of the magnet left\namong the Wel\u017fh, from the olde\u017ft times: and of its application to failing.\nThus have we given a kind of hi\u017ftory of this prodigy in nature, the magne\ntic needle: to confirm our \u017fu\u017fpicion, that the Briti\u017fh Druids knew the u\u017fe of\nit, and u\u017fed it in the\u017fe works of theirs, which we have been treating of We\nlearn in the Philo\u017fophical Tranf\u00e4\u010dtions, Lowthorp, Vol. II. p. 6o 1. that there are\nconfiderable veins of the magnet, in our own country, in Devon\u017fhire; where\nthe Phaenicians and Druids must needs be very conver\u017fant.\nWe return now to our fir\u017ft \u017fubje\u0107t Stonehenge, and apply what has been faid,\nto the ob\u017fervation we there made. It is not to be thought, that the Druids,\nmen who employed them\u017felves in tho\u017fe noble \u017ftudies, which Cae\u017far gives us\nan account of, and who were at the pains of bringing the\u017fe va\u017ft \u017ftones to\ngether, from \u017fuch a confiderable di\u017ftance of 16 miles: I \u017fay, it is not to be\nthought, but that they would be nice and exa\u0107t in placing them. And this,\nnot only particularly, in re\u017fpe\u0107t of each other, upon the proje\u0107ted ground\nplot: but al\u017fo in general, in re\u017fpe\u0107t of the quarters of the heavens. And this\nI found to be a ju\u017ft furmi\u017fe, when I examined their works for feveral years to\ngether, with \u017fufficient accuracy, with a theodilite. As I took notice before,\nthe works of one place regarded the cardinal points, but with a certain uni\nform variation therefrom. Whence I grounded my conje\u0107ture, that they were\nfet by a compa\u017fs, which at that time varied, according to that quantity ob\nferv'd. Of which property of variation we may well \u017fuppo\u017fe, the Druids\nwere ignorant. This I now propo\u017fe for the rule of investigation, of the time\nwhen Stonehenge was ere\u0107ted. Hoping the reader will judge as favourably of\nthe attempt, as things of this great antiquity require.\nThe variation at Stonehenge is about 6 or 7 degrees, from the north ea\u017ft\nward. I have in order to form our hypothe\u017fis, fet down a \u017fcheme of the state\nof the variation in England, from the be\u017ft ob\u017fervations I could meet with.\nDr. Hally takes notice, that the variation at Paris is always 2 degreesand a half\n- - 1Il O1 C\n\fS\n--|\n|\nv\n|\n2\n\u00c9\n4%\n%\n| %\n\\\\\\\\\\'\n| \\\n\\\\\nyw\nis \" \\\\ \\ \\ \\ \\\n\" \" \\\\ \\ ;\n*\n.*\n\\\\ N \\ \\ e\n* \\\\ \\ \\ \\\n',\n-\n\\ \\ *',\n|- - - - \\\\ \\,\\* y\n* ,\n\\ \\\\\n, !\n|\n-\n\\\\ \\ \\\\ \\\\ |\n\\,: \u00a7 V v \\\\\n* , \\ \\\nW\n*\n-\n,t\\\\\n||\n|\n\f-\n\fD E S C R I B E D.\nmore easterly than with us. .

In 9o years the medium of tho\u017fe\nextremes, which was 1657, there was no variation at all; the needle pointing\ndue north and \u017fouth. But alas our ob\u017fervations extend no farther. We know\nnot the bound of the variation, on either hand: nor the quantity of its moti\non, when thereabouts. Mr. Geo. Graham thinks it is now near the we\u017ftern\nbound. It is very flow, in all probability, when upon the return, and as\nit were, \u017ftationary: like the fun's inotion at the tropics, when it is returning.\nSo that the nice determination of its circle, and of its motion, is referved\nfor remote po\u017fterity. Dr. Halley conje\u0107tures, that the whole period of varia\ntion, is perform\u2019d in about 7oo years. Upon this \u017fuppo\u017fition, in gro\u017fs, we\nwe may thus found our conje\u0107ture, of the time of building of Stonehenge.\nBy what we can find, the variation is about 9 minutes in a year, or a de\ngree and a half in Io years, at this part of its circle. Now I ob\u017ferv'd at Stone\nhenge, that the ea\u017ftern wing of the avenue, the cur\u017fus and other parts belonging\nto the temple, abated fomewhat in their variation, eastward, being \u017fomewhat\nle\u017fs than that of the temple it\u017felf. It is highly rea\u017fonable to believe, that the\ngreat work of Stonehenge could not take le\u017fs than half a \u017fcore years in build\ning: and that tho\u017fe other works were made in \u017fucceeding years, not long af\nter it was fini\u017fhed. From hence I gather, which way the magnetic variation\nwas moving, at the time of founding Stonehenge, viz. from ea\u017ft toward no\nvariation and fo to we\u017ft. This muft be the foundation of our calculus.\nTherefore at the time of the founding of Stonehenge, the variation was about\nthe fame quantity and place, as abont A. D. 162o. in our preceeding table.\nSuppofing with Dr. Halley, the revolution of this variation be about 7oo years,\nthree intire revolutions thereof, bring us to about the year of the city of Rome\n28o. which is about 46o years before our Saviour's time: 42o years before\nCe\u017far invaded Britain. About 1oo years before our Saviour's birth, Divitia\ncus made the Wan\/dike north of Stonehenge, and drove the pofe\u017f\u017fors of this\nfine country of the Wilt\u017fhire downs, northwards. So that the Druids enjoy\ned their magnificent work of Stonehenge, but about 36o years, And the very\nS great\n\u2013- = k.\n\f66 S 7' 0 N E H E N G E, &c.\ngreat number of barrows about it, requires, that we \u017fhould not much \u017fhorten\nthe time. Sir I\u017faac Newton in his Chronology, reckons 19 years for a medium\nof a king's reign. So that in that \u017fpace, there were about 19 kings, in this\ncountry. And there \u017feems to be about that number of royal barrows (in my\nway of conje\u0107turing) about the place.\nI ob\u017ferve, this time we have affign'd for the building of Stonehenge, is not\nlong after Camby\/\u1ec3s's inva\u017fion of Egypt. When he committed fuch horrid\noutrages there, and made \u017fuch di\u017fmal havock, with the prie\u017fts and inhabitants\nin general, that they fled the country to all parts of the world. Some went\nas far as the East Indies, and there taught many of the antient Egyptian\ncu\u017ftoms; as is taken notice of by the learned. It is not to be doubted that\nfome of them fled as far weftward, into the i\u017fland of Britain, and introduced\nfome of their learning, arts and religion, among the Druids; and perhaps had\na hand in this very work of Stonehenge: the only one that I know of, where\nthe ftones are chizel'd. All other works of theirs, are of rude ftones, un\ntouch'd of tool, exa\u0107tly after the patriarchal and fewi\u017fh mode: therefore\nolder.\nThis was at a time, when the Ph\u00e6nician trade was at height, the readier a\nconveyance to Britain: it was before the fecond temple at feru\u017falem was built:\nbefore the Grecians had any hi\u017ftory.\nDire8?ions to fhe binder.\nAll the half \u017fheet plates are to be bound up with the book, as fingle leaves,\naccording to their pages, and without guards, viz.
