Upon the whole, the Society has turned away from\nstudies of the former kind, not of set purpose, but partly because\ngood cases were difficult to find ; and partly because other fines of\ninvestigation yielded more definite results. I think that this policy\nwas and is justified, and if I occupy your attention with a somewhat\nunfashionable topic, it is only because I happen to be less ignorant\nabout it than about the other and more fruitful branches of the\nSociety's work.\nIn the time at my disposal I cannot pretend to be exhaustive, and\nmoreover I must confess to being imperfectly acquainted with some\nof the contuiental fiterature, particularly on Eusapia Paladino. For\nthe rest, I befieve I have read most of what would be counted of first\nrate importance, and will try to sum up the impression I have gained\nfrom it.\nThe weak point of most of the earher records of physical pheno-\nmena seems to be that the observers did not succeed in getting the\nphenomena sufficiently imder control to allow them to have the same\neffect repeated again and again, so that specific doubts could be\n^Delivered at a General Meeting of the Society on November 24 1937.\n\f2 Lord Bayleigh, Sc.D., LL.D., F.E.S. [part\ncleared up by renewed observation. So far as general scientific ex-\nperience goes, this is the essential condition for getting light on any\nunexpected effect. Our natural gifts and faculties are not such as to\nallow us to observe and note everything that happens on a given\noccasion. Natural hmitations make us pick out particular facts\nwhich strike us as salient, and we make our reconstruction of the\nevent depend upon them. But, if the selection has to be made in a\nhurry, and without full warning as to what we are to observe, it is\nmore than likely that we shall make the wrong selection from the\nobservable facts : and then om* reconstruction will be altogether\nwide of the mark : for we shall lack the essential material for a\ncorrect reconstruction. The success of the conjurer is one of the best\nillustrations of this. A good conjurer will almost always refuse to do\na trick over again : or, if he pretends to comply with such a request,\nwe may be fairly sure that he will really use quite a different method\nof producing the same effect : for he knows that if he really repeats\nhis trick, he gives the observer an enormously improved chance of\npicking out the essential facts. What passed muster as a chance\noccurrence the first time will not do so again. Attention is concen-\ntrated on the apparently irrelevant circumstance, and this sets the\nobserver thinking in the right direction. He arrives at a provisional\nhypothesis, and this may suggest to him a further question, to answer\nwhich he requires to see the performance a third time, or even more.\nI believe all this will be mwch clearer if it is illustrated by a con-\ncrete example. As I have said professional conjurers will not repeat\ntheir tricks on request : but the regular performer on a public plat-\nform is at a disadvantage in this matter, for his repertoire is limited,\nand he must repeat his tricks : so that the earnest seeker after truth\ncan see them as often as he pleases. For two generations Messrs.\nMaskelyne had a regular afternoon exhibition of first-class conjuring :\nand a young man of my acquaintance made it a hobby to try to\npenetrate their secrets, not always without success. In one of their\ntricks a man -was placed on a kind of chair, with his knees doubled\nup to his chin. What purported to happen was as follows ; A\ncanvas cover was placed over him, but the audience could see under-\nneath ;\nand, moreover, an observer from the audience was behind.\nThe right hand protruded through a hole in the canvas, and was\ntouched by a member of the audience. The left arm was held up by\na string attached to a strap buckled round his wrist, and this string\npassed out over pulleys to another member of the audience, who\nheld it taut. At the word go, the right hand was withdrawn, the\nstring attached to the left wrist became slack, and on removal of\nthe canvas cover the man had disappeared. Where had he gone to?\n\f152] . Presidential Address 3\nMy young acquaintance was completely mystified the first time he\nsaw it. The second time he noticed that during the preliminaries,\nthe canvas covering, which was extensible concertina fashion, and\nwas lowered from above, was allowed to fall, as if by accident, to the\nfloor for a moment, being then pulled up again. He vaguely remem-\nbered that the same thing had happened before, but since the right\nhand protruded from the opening throughout, he had not doubted\nthat the man was still there, and had attached no importance to the\nincident. But the second time set his mind working, and he was\ninclined to regard this as a salient fact. He went home and thought\nabout it. Was there no possibihty that the man had escaped through\nthe floor while the canvas was down? Perhaps the hand was not\nreally his hand, though it was not easy to see how it could be other-\nwise. Anjnvay this point could be tested. Next time he went up on\nto the stage as an observer from the audience : when invited to\nexamine the man who was to vanish, to see that he was not a\n' collapsible automaton \", my friend took occasion to examine\nclosely the characteristics of the finger nails of the right hand,\nwhether they were long or short, clean or dirty, and so on. When\nthe hand was thrust out for him to hold, he saw at once that it was\nnot the same. He noticed further that the front legs of the chair\nwere of hollow metal work\u2014heraldic animals or something of the\nsort, so that an arm might readily be thrust through from below the\nstage, and allow the hand belonging to it to come out through the\nslit in the canvas screen. Thus the mystery was practically ex-\nplained, for I need not pause over the details about the other hand.\nThe moral I wish to emphasise is that the essential facts that the\ncanvas screen momentarily descended to the ground, and that the\nfront leg of the chair was big enough to contain a human arm, were\ndisplayed quite openly to the observer. But he did not at first see\nthat they were at all relevant, and they did not fully penetrate his\nconsciousness : so that he could not use them in his reconstruction\nof the scene, and he reconstructed it in a way that in fact depicted\nan impossibility.\nThe great, and indeed almost the only possible security against\nthis kind of thing is that the phenomenon under investigation should\nbe seen again and again, with full consideration between whiles, in\norder that any doubtful points in the observer's conception of what\noccurred should be noted, and the omission repaired on the next\noccasion. 1 I have, for the sake of clearness, used as an illustration\na case where deception was admittedly being practised. But the\n^ A cinematograph film of the whole series of events would no doubt be\nequivalent.\nA 2\n\f4 Lord Rayleigh, Sc.D., LL.D., F.R.S. [part\nsame applies in all cases when we wish to give an accurate account\nof observed matters of fact, even when no question of intentional\ndeception enters\n\u2014\ne.g. in the ordinary researches of the physical\nlaboratory. No experienced worker is satisfied by doing an experi-\nment once ; or even twice. If he sleeps on it, he will usually find\nthat doubts have arisen by the morning, and he will perhaps repeat\nthe observation many times, improving the conditions if possible,\nso as to concentrate on any weak points which have occurred\nto liim.\nAfter a somewhat prolonged study of the early accounts of ob-\nservations of physical phenomena, particularly those observed with\nD. D. Home, the chief criticism I have to make is that they are\ndeficient in this regard. Mr Podmore ^ usually emphasises that the\ndescription is inadequate for the reader to judge of what really\nhappened : and he interprets the omission in the way least favour-\nable to the phenomenon : indeed, to my mind, he strains the avail-\nable data in this direction, suggesting for example that if a pheno-\nmenon is not stated to have occurred in the hght, it must be assumed\nto have always occurred in the dark. We could easily make mince-\nmeat of many of the classics of scientific investigation, if we allowed\nourselves to criticise them in this sort of way. Upon the whole, the\nobserver himself must be the judge of whether he had enough light\nto see what he describes, though no doubt an explicit statement\nabout the hght is desirable. I do not thinlc that an attempt to\nreconstruct the inwardness of what occurred from the written\naccoimt is likely to be often fruitful, even if it has been so occasion-\nally. It is impracticable to record every condition of a phenomenon\nin case it might be wanted. Would anyone draw the moral from\nthe case I have given above that we must always describe the legs\nof the chairs and tables used, or examine finger nails in case these\ndetails might be relevant ? Clearly not. To do this kind of thing\nwould over-bxirden the account intolerably. The essential thing is\nthat the observer himself should detect when his account requires to\nbe supplemented, and himself supply the omission : and he can only\ndo this if he can get the opportunity to repeat his observation, if\npossible under improved conditions.\nUpon the whole, the well-known accounts of observations made\nin the presence of D. D. Home do not show the observers as alive to\nthe importance of this ; and so far as they are deficient in this\nrespect, they are to my mind subject to a heavy discount. Lord\nDunraven indeed tells us that he was brought into contact with\n^ Modern Spiritualism, London, 1902 ; and The Newer Spiritiuilism,\nLondon, 1910.\n\f152] Presidential Address 5\nHome by accidental circumstances and that he did not feel himself\nspecially quahfied or inclined to pursue the subject in its scientific\naspect : when the first sensation had worn off, his interest seems to\nhave diminished.^ The Master of Lindsay (afterwards 26th Earl of\nCrawford), one of the other chief observers of D. D. Home's pheno-\nmena,^ did not give very systematic accounts of what he had seen.\nHe gives indeed general assurances that he had been able to satisfy\nany doubts he may have originally felt, but he does not seem ever\nto have contemplated a detailed dissection of e.g. the phenomenon\nof levitation, such as was afterwards made by Dr Crawford of\nBelfast.3\nWhen we come to the investigations of Sir William Crookes,* we\nfind, as might be expected, more attempt at systematic investigation.\nExperiments were planned to improve the conditions, and clear up\ndoubts and obscurities. For example, in reference to \" materialisa-\ntions \" Crookes made repeated attempts to see the medium and the\nmaterialised figure together, and considered that he had succeeded.\nThis, however, was effectively criticised by Podmore.^ Further, he\ntook photographs of the \" materiaUsed \" figure. The unexplained\nmovements of a pivoted lever obtained in the presence of D. D. Home\nwere recorded graphically on a smoked glass, and various experi-\nmental precautions were taken to improve the conditions under\nwhich the other phenomena were obtained.\nWhatever may be thought of its conclusiveness, there is no doubt\nthat this work represents a definite advance in the spirit in which it\nwas conducted. It does not go far enough however. As well as can\nbe judged, much of the time was spent in waiting for fresh marvels,\n1 Proceedings, S.P.R., vol. xxxv, pp. 21-25, 1926.\n2 Report on Spiritualism of the Committee of the London Dialectical Society\/,\nLondon, 1873, pp. 206, 213.\n^ I have asked the present Lord Crawford whether any unpubhshed letters\nor memoranda of his father's on this matter survive. He kindly made search\nbut failed to find any. He has also Avritten to me of conversations with his\nfather, who adhered to the position that he had seen levitation in Home's\npresence, but coupled this mth the impression that Home was a charlatan.\nIt is difficult to know what to make of this, but I think it must tend to discount\nthe force of his evidence in favour of the phenomena.\nIt need scarcely be said that the work of the late Dr W. J. Crawford of\nBelfast is not comiected in any way with the experiences of the late Lord\nCrawford with D. D. Home. The identity of names is merely a coincidence.\n* Researches on the Phenomena of Spirituxdism, London, 1874.\n^ On the ground that this seance was not in Crookes' house but at the\nmedium's own home and that the medium might have been personated by a\nconfederate. See Modern Spiritualism, vol. ii, p. 155.\n\f6 Lord Rayleigh, Sc.D., LL.D., F.R.S. [part\nunder easy-going conditions, rather than in trying definitely to\nconfirm and elucidate those already obtained. I am far from saying\nthat Crookes was to blame for this. It is quite likely that he pressed\nthe policy of persistent investigation as far as he was allowed. The\nsame may be said of many subsequent investigators, who would no\ndoubt have liked to push their enquiries in the direction here advo-\ncated, but found that they were not given a chance of doing so.\nThis brings us to near the close of the epoch of D. D. Home and\nhis contemporaries. Many striking facts had been recorded, by\napparently trustworthy witnesses. Their evidence has been dis-\ncussed at great length by numerous critics, and the utmost has been\ndone to shake it : but, upon the whole, with only limited success.\nThe statements then made still constitute a prima facie case for\ninvestigation, and it is hard to see how anything that can be done in\nthe future, however negative, can altogether destroy the effect of\nthese records : for failure to repeat can hardly constitute a disproof,\nwhen the identical conditions cannot be re-established.\nUp to this point some of my hearers may think that I have been\nover lenient, if not credulous, in my estimate of the evidence. Per-\nhaps what I am now about to say may be a partial corrective. Even\nif it should eventually become possible to establish the reahty of\nphenomena of this kind to everyone's satisfaction, it wo\\ild be of\nvery little use, unless we could succeed in going further, and fit\nthem into their proper place in the general scheme of things.\nMerely to realise that there are more things in heaven and earth\nthan are dreamed of in one's philosophy is hardly an end in itself.\nThe end should be to expand one's philosophy so as to include\nthem.\nConsider the phenomenon of lightning as an illustration. There\nhas of course never been any doubt about the reality of this, though\nin early times it appeared so anomalous and unaccountable that it\nwas regarded as a direct sign of the anger of the gods. (Then, as\nnow, there was a tendency to jump to the conclusion that unex-\nplained phenomena were to be attributed to the arbitrary action of\ninvisible beings.) The observed fact did not at all contribute to the\ngeneral edifice of scientific knowledge. It lay about like a loose stone\nof odd size, and served no purpose, until Frankhn, by his experiment\nwith a kite, demonstrated that lightning was an electrical pheno-\nmenon, and thus fitted the loose stone into the general structure.\nBuilders take no interest in stones of odd size until they can find a\nplace to fit them into. That gives the key to why our studies are\nso little regarded by the scientific world.\n\f152] Presidential Address 7\nWe may go a step further, and consider the more obscure pheno-\nmenon of globe lightning, which, as described, consists of detached\nballs of fire. My father made reference to this in his presidential\naddress to the S.P.R. in 1919. Since he wrote, many more cases\nhave been recorded, and photographs have been published ^ which,\nwhile not altogether in accordance with some of the descriptions,\nseem to prove the objective reahty of occurrences having this general\ncharacter. But they are scarcely understood any better than before.\nThe reason of failure is no doubt that we cannot command them at\npleasure so as to devise and carry out experimental tests. That is\nthe same kind of dijfficulty as we meet with in connexion with our\nown problem. Some people think it is in itself a ground for incredu-\nhty : but this is a train of thought which I have never been able to\nfollow. What they probably have at the back of their minds is that\nwhen an effect occurs sporadically, at a time that cannot be foreseen,\nit is not likely that the best witnesses will be on the spot, and even\nif they are, they may be taken by surprise, and cannot confirm or\nrevise their impressions of what happened by frequent repetition, as\nI hope I have convinced you it is essential to do.\nIn the early days of the Society much attention was paid to phys-\nical phenomena, and now the spirit of persistent investigation be-\ncame dominant, largely under the influence of Mrs Sidgwick, and,\nlater, of Dr Hodgson. The investigation turned chiefly on the ques-\ntion of whether control was adequate or not, and did not get much\nfurther. It must be admitted that the results were disappointing,\nfor after spending much time and trouble, especially in connexion\nwith the medium Eusapia Paladino, no definite result was arrived\nat which commanded the general assent of prominent members. It\nwas indeed common ground that Eusapia had been caught fraudu-\nlently evading control, and almost common ground that she must\nhave assiduously practised the methods of deception which she used ;\nbut here agreement ended. Some, including Sir Ohver Lodge, Mr\nEverard Feilding, Mr Hereward Carrington and Mr W. W. Baggally,\nwere convinced that on occasion she exhibited genuine phenomena\nof telekinesis and the like. On the other hand Dr Hodgson, Mrs\nSidgwick and Mr Podmore remained unconvinced.\nSince those who were concerned with the actual observations were\nnot able to agree, it is not likely that any subsequent armchair study\nwill help to clear the matter up. My own feeling is that the effects\nwhich were relied on by the behevers did not differ enough from\nthose generally admitted to be fraudulent to afford any firm basis\non which to build further.\n1 Jensen, Physics, 4, p. 372 (1933).\n\f8 Lord Rayleigh, Sc.D., LL.D., F.R.S. [part\nWe come next to the investigations of the late Dr W. J. Crawford\nof Belfast with Miss Kathleen Goligher as medium.^ Dr Crawford\nwas a lecturer in mechanical engineering at the Municipal Technical\nInstitute of Belfast, and from enquiries I have made he seems to\nhave impressed other scientific mexi favourably. The medium usually\nsat with a circle of her own friends and relations, a fact to which due\nprominence must be given.\nDr Crawford's work was largely directed to determining the\nmechanical reactions of the forces which came into play in the\nlevitations he observed. For this purpose he placed the medium on\na weighing machine, to determine whether the seat of the reaction\nwas on her. He worked by the light of a red lamp, of which more\nwill be said later.\nDr Crawford describes how he was able to have a table weighing\nabout 10 lbs. levitated and kept steady about eight inches up in the\nair for as long as he required to make a test of the addition to the\nordinary weight of the medium. This was two or three minutes,\nand apparently he could have had more, for on each occasion he\nindicated that he had finished. It was found that the medium\ngained weight about equal to that of the table. These steady\nconditions could only be obtained after the sitting had continued\nfor some time.\nDr Crawford interprets this gain of weight by the medium as due\nto an invisible cantilever or rigid bracket, which comes out from the\nbody of the medium, and supports the table. Mrs Sidgwick, in a\nreview of Dr Crawford's first book, hints that this \" cantilever \" is\nnothing else than the medium's leg. Many statements in Dr Craw-\nford's various publications, however, are definitely at variance with\nthis hypothesis. Thus {E.P.S., p. 119) \" Practically no palpabihty\nis experienced when one cuts through the psychic structure with the\nhand, or, say, with a piece of wood.\" ^\nDr Crawford's hypothesis is, however, so fraught with mecha-\nnical difficulties that it is questionable whether it really helps much\nto correlate the facts he has determined, assuming that these latter\nare correct. To begin with, it is almost self-contradictory to postu-\nlate a structure which is rigid to act as a cantilever, and not rigid\nat all for the hand or a piece of wood to pass through it. The\nattempt to imagine a medium rigid for some purposes but not for\n^ Recorded in his three books : The Reality of Psychic Phenomena, London,.\n1919, here referred to as R.P.P. ;\nExperiments in Psychical Science, London,.\n1919, referred to as E.P.8. ; The Psychic Structures at the Goligher Circle^\nLondon, 1921.\n2 See also R.P.P., p. 87.\n\f152] Presidential Address 9\notters is not new to science. Problems of this character arose in\nconnexion with the elastic solid theory of the luniiniferous ether,\nwhich was to show rigidity for carrying rapid transverse vibrations,\nand fluidity to allow sohd bodies, e.g. the earth in its orbit, to pass\nthrough.^ Lord Kelvin at one time appealed to the properties of\nbodies Uke hard pitch or cobbler's wax, which while reacting to very\nrapidly alternating forces, will yield viscously in time to forces apphed\nsteadily in one direction. ^ But to satisfy Crawford's hypothesis the\nrequirement is that there should be great stiffness for persistent\nforces, and fluidity for more transient ones. This is too much to ask.\nAnother difficulty is boldly stated by Dr Crawford {E.P.S., p. 117).\n\" How can it be \", he says, \" that a rigid structure two or three feet\nlong can issue from the medium's body and support 30 or 40 lbs.\nweight at its end, and the medium experience no inconvenience? \" ^\nDr Crawford has his own tentative answer to this question, though I\ncannot personally feel satisfied by it. But in this and other instances\nthe candid way in which specific questions are faced produces a\nfavourable impression, compared with the mere appeal to mysticism\nof so many writers on these subjects. Dr Crawford's theory perhaps\nraises more difliculties than it answers ;\nnevertheless, if work of tliis\nkind is ever satisfactorily built into the scientific edifice, I do not\ndoubt that he will rank as a pioneer.\n^ A short explanation of this matter may be useful. When it had been\nestablished that light, like sound, was of the nature of a wave movement, it\nwas considered necessary to postulate a medium in order to convey it. If the\nwaves were waves of compression, as is the case of sound travelling in air or\nwater, then a fluid medium would do, and there would be no particular diffi-\nculty in understanding how solid bodies could pass through it. But waves\nof compression could not account for the phenomenon called the polarisation\nof light. When a ray of light passes through a suitable polariser, such as a\ntourmaline crystal, it acquu'es sides \" as Sir Isaac Newton expressed it.\nIt is no longer an indifferent matter if the beam is rotated on its own axis.\nWe can prove this by a second tourmaline crystal. This will only transmit\nthe beam if it is placed parallel to the first tourmahne. If crossed with the\nfirst there is no transmission.\nNow waves can only give room for effects of this kind if they are transverse\nto the direction of propagation. It is clear that there can be nothing of the\nsort in compressional waves for in these no one transverse direction can have\npreference over any other. It was therefore concluded that the vibrations\nwere transverse. But (apart from what happens at a free surface) fluids\ncaimot transmit such waves. Elastic sohds can do so in virtue of their stiffness.\nHence the elastic solid ether.\n^ I need scarcely say that the elastic sohd ether is now superseded by quite\na different order of ideas.\n^ This of course applied to a different experiment from that already referred\nto with the 10 lb. table.\n\f10 Lord Eayleigh, Sc.D., LL.D., F.R.S. [part\nSpace is lacking to go into further particulars of Dr Crawford's\nwork. It is necessary to mention that he died by his own hand\nbefore the whole of it was published. I shall return to this point a\nlittle later.\nAbout a year after Dr Crawford's death, the late Dr E. E. Fournier\nD'Albe proceeded to Belfast and had a series of sittings with Miss\nGoligher, with a view to confirming and extending the work of\nCrawford\/ which had impressed him favourably. He failed to\nobtain any phenomena which he could regard as evidential. It was\napparently admitted that they were not so (p. 43). Although he\nexpressly reserves the question of whether any of Dr Crawford's\nresults could be accepted as supernormal it is pretty evident that\nhe thought they could not be. Towards the end Crawford had\nobtained numerous photographs of what he regarded as \" psychic\nstructures \" rendered visible under special conditions. They are\npublished in his last book. The half tone blocks made from these\nphotographs are undoubtedly very suggestive of pieces of muslin\nor the like, hung from the bottom of the table or knotted on to\nits legs. Fournier gives similar pictures of much better defini-\ntion published as actual photographic prints, not half tone blocks,\nand I fully agree with him that they show the material to be a\nwoven product. This is the most damaging feature in the Avhole\ncase.\nFournier also tells in detail how he saw the medium raising a stool\nwith her extended foot. Fournier worked as far as possible under\nthe same conditions as Crawford. He had the same circle of sitters,\nand in one instance actually held the sitting in Dr Crawford's house.\nHe also used the identical appliances, lent by Mrs Crawford. These\ncircumstances are of some importance because they show that she\nremained on friendly terms with the medium, and can scarcely have\nattributed Dr Crawford's collapse to his having been ultimately\nconvinced that the medium had deceived him. Dr Crawford stated\nin his posthumous letter that this was not the reason of his break-\ndown, and I, for one, accept his statement.\nNo really valid reason seems to be known for doubting the candour\nand accuracy of either Fournier or Crawford, so far as they are\ndescribing what they themselves observed. Fournier says (pp. 48,\n49) : \"I have no reason to doubt the conscientious and accurate\ncharacter of Dr Crawford's observations and records.\"\nFournier thinks that Crawford was too soon convinced that all\nwas well, and relaxed his vigilance prematurely. But Crawford's\nletters written during the last few months of his life, and given by\n1 The Goligher Circle, London, 1922.\n\f152] Presidential Address 11\n\u00a5ouriiier (pp. 66-70), negative tliis view, for they are full of details\nof the various precautions which he took.\nFournier emphasises strongly that the shadow of the table afforded\nprotection for fraudulent manipulation, but there are passages in\nCrawford's books which seem to be a complete answer on the point.\nThus (R.P.P., p. 13) :\n\" Even with the largest table it is sometimes\npossible to see completely underneath (as I have done), to see the\nfeet and bodies of all present at rest, and hands held together in\nchain order, while the table has been steadily levitated.\"\nAgain {Psychic Strtictures, p. 8) : \"A strong red Hght was falling\nupon the space below the levitated table while another source of red\nlight was showing from behind so that the whole area between the\nmedium and the levitated table was itself quite \\'isible, and I sliifted\nmy position into various positions in the circle, looking at the space\nbelow the table from different angles. But to all appearance the\nspace was empty. ...\"\nIf we accept this statement as being, in Fournier's own words,\n\" conscientious and accurate,\" I think it is clear that his criticism\nfails.\nFournier says (p. 49) :\n\" The tests to which he [Crawford] sub-\nmitted the medium completely satisfied him as to her bo'na fides so\nthat he no longer thought it necessary to control the other sitters as\nwell.\" It is, however, instructive to compare this with a passage\nfrom Crawford (R.P.P., p. 16) :\n\" The experiments in Chapter III\nshow conclusively that while the table is steadily levitated nearly\nthe whole of its weight is upon the medium. Therefore it follows\nthat if anyone is hfting the table with any part of his body, it is the\nmedium, and the others are not concerned.\"\nMoreover Crawford states {R.P.P., p. 81) that he was allowed to\nmove anywhere between the sitters and the levitated table except\nimmediately infront of the medium. If this statement too is accepted\nas \" conscientious and accurate \", it is difficult to see the force of\nFournier's remarlv above quoted, in which he suggests fraud of the\nsitters as the factor neglected by Crawford : the more so that he\nclaims to have seen \" levitation \" achieved by the medium's foot.\nFournier does not seem to have really made up his mind whether\nthe table was fraudulently raised by the medium, or fraudulently\nraised by the sitters.\nI must frankly admit that I am unable to sum up this case to my\nsatisfaction. Fournier does not profess to discuss Crawford's work\nin detail, and he seems tacitly to admit that for all he can say some\npart of it may have been correct, though he evidently does not\nthink so. Crawford's pubhcations contain a complete answer to\n\f12 Lord Rayleigh, Sc.D., LL.D., F.R.S. [part\nFournier's general objections, and I am unfavourably impressed by\nFournier's failure to notice this. On the other hand, Fournier does\nseem to have proved that the medium was on occasion fraudulent.\nIt is difficult to understand what could have been her motive in\ncontinuing to deceive Crawford for the first three years, during\nwhich there was no payment. It is also difficult to discount either\nwitness. Crawford is confirmed on the main points by several other\nobservers.^ Fournier stands alone, but produced his photographs,\nshowing the woven texture of what purports to be a \" psychic\nstructure \". Both records are very satisfactory in point of detail\nand internal consistency, standing far above the available accounts\nof D. D. Home in this respect ; and the very matter-of-fact style of\nCrawford's narrative makes any idea of hallucination seem alto-\ngether out of place. In this unsatisfactory position I must leave the\ncase.\nFinally, I come to Rudi Schneider. A great deal has been written\non this medium, much of it of a polemical character. It would be\ntedious and unprofitable to go over this in detail, and discussion\nmust be hmited to the work of MM. Eugene and Marcel Osty in\nParis, ^ passing over other investigations with the remark that I am\nnot convinced by the evidences of fraud which have been put\nforward. I shall, however, give due consideration to the question of\nwhether fraud could have affected MM. Osty's results.\nMM. Osty initially fixed their attention on the phenomenon of\ntelekinesis, or moving of objects by an unknown agency in the pre-\nsence of the (controlled) medium. It is generally known that a beam\nof hght can be used to guard a treasure, a warning bell being rung\nwhen a potential thief approaches too near and intercepts the beam.\nThe method depends on an obvious application of the photoelectric\ncell, a device which passes an electric current when light falls upon\nit.3\nNow it occurred to MM. Osty that by using a beam of infra-red\nhght instead of visual light the method could be carried out in a\ndark seance room and that the object (flower, handkerchief and the\nlike), proposed for telekinesis could be guarded by the beam, so that\nif the medium succeeded in escaping from the controller who was by\n^ See in particular Whately Smith, Proceedings S.P.R., vol. xxx, p. 314,\n1920.\n^ Les Pouvoirs Inconnus de UEsprit sur la Matiere, Paris, 1932.\n^ It is necessary of course to arrange a relay to switch the bell current on\nwhen the photoelectric current is cut off.\n\f152] Presidential Address 13\nway of holding him, and attempted to seize the handkerchief in\norder to move it, a bell would ring and give warning.\nIt was found in fact that the bell did ring on frequent occasions-\nwhen the medium was, or purported to be, in trance. The ringing\nwas sometimes maintained for half a minute or even a minute.\nFlashlight photographs were taken while the bell was ringing, and\nthey revealed the medium sitting in his usual hunched position, with\nhis head sunk forward, his hands held, and his knees between the\nknees of the controller. Nothing was to be seen in the path of the\ninfra-red beam.\nIt seems therefore that whatever it was that obstructed the beam,\nit was not an ordinary solid obstacle. Whatever its nature, it\nseemed to fade away under the influence of ordinary light : for\nlateral illumination of the beam, although it did not reveal anything,\nhad the effect of promptly stopping the ringing of the bell.\nAlthough the infra-red beam was intercepted as if something was\ntrying to reach the handkerchief or other object, the latter was not\noften moved, and the experimenters wisely decided to abandon this\nas a primary object of study, and to concentrate attention on the\nphenomenon that was more easily obtained, namely the obscuration\nof the infra-red ray. The bell was replaced by a galvanometer with\na photographic recording drum adapted to give a continuous graph\nof the deflections. The obscurations previously indicated by the\nbell were now photographed on the drum, which gave a record of\nintensity and duration.\nAfter the work had been in progress for some time the ordinary\ngalvanometer which had been in use was replaced by one of quick\nperiod (yg- sec.) with the view of examining in more detail how the\nobscuring action set in. [I must explain for the benefit of readers\nnot versed in physics that scientific measuring instruments are not\neftective for recording changes appreciably more rapid than their\nown free period of vibration. Instruments of long period are too\nsluggish to follow quick changes.] With the quick acting galvano-\nmeter, a very significant fact was noticed. When the ray was\n(partially) obscured, it was seen that the galvanometer spot moved\nin sympathy with the loud and rapid breathing of the entranced\nmedium. The expiration and the inspiration each involved a\nmuscular effort : and the number of obscurations of the infra-red\nray corresponded with the number of these muscular efforts. It\nwas clear therefore that the obscuring action was connected directly\nor indirectly with the medium's muscular processes. This fact alone\nseems to rule out confederacy.\nWhen the above relations had been recognised arrangements\n\f14 Lord Rayleigh, Sc.D., LL.D., F.R.S. [part\nwere made for automatically recording the motions of the medium's\nchest on the same chart as the infra-red absorptions. Several such\ncharts are reproduced by the authors, and allow the frequency\nrelation to be verified. For example when the infra-red absorp-\ntion has a frequency of 5 per second, the breathing has a frequency\nof 2-5 per second.^\nThese graphs published by MM. Osty are in my view one of the\nmost valuable contributions ever made to our subject. The critics\nwho have discussed their work adversely appear to me to have\ntotally failed to face up to them : indeed many of the criticisms that\nI have seen are completely answered in advance by the original\npublication, so that it hardly seems worth while to answer them\nfurther. The great value of the graphs is that they carry their own\ntale, and that every student can examine them for himself, nearly as\nwell as the original experimenters could do. The destructive critics\nhave here an unrivalled field for the exercise of their talents, but so\nfar they have not made any effective use of it.\nI have read a criticism which suggests that Schneider made\nfraudulent use of the phenomenon of resonance. It is suggested\nthat he timed his breathings in such a way that the movements of\nhis body were in unison with the free period of swing of one of the\nsupports of the apparatus. It is assumed that a large oscillation of\nthe support was worked up in this way, enough to secure that only\npart of the beam entered the photo electric cell, thus simulating an\nabsorption. I do not say that a suspicion of this kind is unreasonable\nprima facie. On the contrary, it is the sort of thing that constantly\nhaunts the night thoughts of the careful experimentahst, and should\ncause him to look to the supports in the morning, and to see whether\na vibration can in fact be worked up in the way suggested. Unfor-\ntunately that sort of test can only be applied at the time : but there\nare other tests which can be applied to the graphic records. One\npoint is that, on the view suggested, the frequency recorded must be\nrigidly equal to the frequency of the free vibrations of the support,\nand therefore constant as long as the arrangements are unaltered.\nThis test is not satisfied. For example,^ on June 11, 1931, at 22 h.\n49 m. the rate was 5 absorptions a second, and three minutes later,\nthe rate was 8 absorptions a second.\nAnother point is that on this hypothesis the mechanical oscillation\nis gradually worked up, and therefore that its effect progressively\nincreases. The successive absorptions ought to increase regularly in\n1 Complete periods are always referred to, e.g. in breathing, from the begin-\nning of one inspiration to the beginning of the next inspiration.\n^ loc. cit., p. 125.\n\f152] Presidential Address 15\namplitude and then gradually die down. But when we examine the\ngraphs, we find nothing of the kind. In the first absorption of a\nseries they have an average value, and exceptionally large absorp-\ntions occur quite sporadically, and not as a culmination. So far from\ndying down gradually, in one case the very last absorption is much\nthe most intense.\nIn various criticisms it is suggested that Schneider had a con-\nfederate in the room, or that he succeeded in evading control. In\nsome investigations, for example, those concerned with Eusapia\nPaladino, such questions were fundamental. I do not think they\nare so here. It is useless to suggest that Schneider might have\nevaded control unless that will help us to explain how he could have\nproduced the periodic absorption at this very high frequency, in\nexact time with his breathings. Again, as regards the hypothesis of\nconfederacy, I have already pointed out that the connexion with\nhis breathings indicate that he, and not a confederate, is producing\nthe effects.\nThe point that specially appeals to me is that we have a definite\ncorrelation between two phenomena, the deep breaths taken by the\nmedium, and the absorptions of the infra-red ray, which correlation\ndepends on a very large number of repetitions of each phenomenon.\nSo much of what has been done in this field, however earnest the\nattempts of the experimenters, has only led to casual and sporadic\nobservations ; not helping, so to speak, to connect any two pieces\nof the puzzle. Here, however, two pieces of it are definitely con-\nnected : the loud rapid breathing and the periodic infra-red\nabsorptions.\nIf it is objected that this connexion is a trick carefully arranged\nby Schneider, we must remember that the connexion itself was not\nperceived until well on in the investigation a quick period reflecting\ngalvanometer of the necessary high sensitivity was procured. This\nis an out-of-the-way instrument (I doubt whether most University\nprofessors of physics were aware that such an instrument was on\nthe market, at any rate I was not aware of it), and even when it\nwas procured the above connexion was only noticed accidentally.\nTo suppose that Schneider knew about quick period reflecting\ngalvanometers, and laid his plans in anticipation of this sequence\nof events, would on the whole be absurd.\nWhat, it will be asked, is the nature of the substance or agency\nthat obscured the infra-red ray in these experiments? Is it the\nsame as the material of the \" psychic structures \" in Crawford's\nexperiments? Or is it identical with the \" ectoplasm \" of which\nwe have heard so much? Lam afraid I must decline to enter upon\n\f16 Lord Rayleigh, Sc.D., LL.D., F.R.S. [part\nthese questions, which are altogether premature. I am not sure\n\"that Crawford's condusions are correct, and I do not know of any\n^ observations on ectoplasm under really satisfactory conditions. We\n\u2022can and probably shall speculate about it in our own minds : but\nthe Society's pubhcations should not be encumbered with guess\nAvork. What is wanted is an independent repetition of Osty's\n\u2022experiments.\nIn the meantime, it is necessary to emphasise what seems to be.\n-a serious difficulty, when we come to consider the properties which\nDr Osty finds in the invisible substance.\nSo far as we may claim to know anything about the action of\nlight, I think we may say that it cannot modify matter without\nbeing absorbed in the process. Many illustrations of this principle\nmight be given, but I will limit myself to one. Ordinary photo-\ngraphic plates are sensitive to blue light : and corresponding to this\nwe find that the sensitising substance, bromide of silver, absorbs\nblue hght. On the other hand, yellow and red light are not absorbed,\nand we find that the plate is not sensitive to these kinds of hght.\nWe may make it sensitive to them by staining it with certain dyes.\nBut in doing so we have introduced an absorbing power for red and\nyellow light, so that the principle still holds.\nDr Osty's whole investigation depends on the fact that infra-red\nrays are absorbed by the \" invisible substance \". He considers that\nunder the condition that prevailed this absorption was effective for\nwaves of length l\/t (fi=Tooo of a milhmetre) upwards, and he\nemphasises that shorter waves were not absorbed,^ though he thinks\nthat under other and better conditions they might be.\nFurther, the fact that the substance is \" invisible \" shows that it\ndoes not absorb ordinary visual light. If it did so, as, e.g. iodine\nvapour does, it could not of course be invisible, but would be seen\n\u2022dark on a luminous background. Or if it absorbed by lateral\nscattering, like an ordinary aqueous mist, it would itself appear as\n.a bright cloud when illuminated.\nBut if the substance does not absorb visible light, how can it be\nthat visible light destroys it, or at all events makes it ineffective ?\n^\nIf we accept the principle which I have explained, that light can\n\u2022only modify a substance when that substance absorbs it, then an\ninvisible substance cannot be destroyed by visual light. Until this\nparadox is cleared up, it cannot be said that we are standing on\nfirm ground.\n1 Myers Memorial Lecture, 1933. Supernormal Aspects of Energy and\nMatter, p. 21.\n^ See above, p. 13.\n\f152] Presidential Address 17\nThe supernormal knowledge which, as all real students of the\nsubject are now pretty well agreed, is shown by some mediums in\ntrance, is largely admixed with incorrect or nonsensical matter, or\nwith the attempt to get information from the sitter by \" fishing\n\"\nand attempting to pass it off as supernormally acquired. It is an\nempirical fact that the attempt (whether genuine or fraudulent) to\nproduce apparently supernormal physical happenings frequently\naccompanies these trance utterances, and the trance personahty\nwithout doubt wishes to claim the credit of having produced them.\nIf we accept the view that these are occasionally genuine, then it\nwould be natural to regard the fraudulent tricks played in trance\nas having the same relation to the genuine phenomena as the worth-\nless utterances have to those which show supernormal knowledge.\nThe trance personahty, we may suppose, is wilhng to dehver genuine\ngoods, whether of the mental or physical kind : but if not successful\nin doing so, it will produce the fraudulent ones rather than none at\naU.\nThis hne of thought, it seems to me, should make us less ready\nthan we otherwise might be to at once discard all phenomena pro-\nduced by a medium who has once been detected in fraud. If we\nhad at once discarded the whole series of trance utterances or\nautomatic writings in which one misstatement of fact had been de-\ntected, the Society's labours would have been less fruitful than we\nventure to hope they actually have been.\nI am incUned to sum up by saying that while a great part of what\nhas been reported under this head, e.g. slate writing, materialisation\nof complete figures, is fraud, deliberately prepared by impudent\nimposters, and having nothing to do with the phenomena of trance,\nyet there is another part intimately bound up with the trance per-\nsonality. Much of this latter is likewise fraudulent, but there seems\nto be an appreciable residue which has not been successfully dis-\nsolved by the acid of destructive criticism which has been so freely\npoured over it. The evidence seems to stand, and if we dogmatically\nreject it we shall be open to the reproach of laying down what ought\nto be the order of nature, instead of observing what is. If it is\ndifficult to reconcile with our other notions, that may only be\nbecause these require to be revised or extended. Physical science\nhas had to make adjustments of that kind often enough in the last\nfew decades, and it would be rash to conclude that we have reached\nfinahty. But if adjustment is really necessary it will hardly be\nmade until we have the phenomena under control for detailed\nexamination to a much greater extent than has usually been\nattained. The investigators have usually been driven to give in to\n\f18 Lord EayleigJi, Sc.D., LL.D., F.R.S. [part 152]\nevery whim of the trance personahty, to submit to producing noise,\nand to wait for interminable hours in the darkness. They have been\nthreatened with dire results if they ventured to touch, or examine\nwithout permission. It is almost impossible to find out anything\ndefinite under these conditions : and I cannot but agree with Dr\nW. F. Prince and others who have insisted that it is a waste of time\nand energy to attempt it any more. That better conditions are not\nimpossible of attainment, the work of Crawford and of Osty seems,\nto show : and if the present unsatisfactory condition of affairs is to\nbe bettered, it can only be by following the example which they\nhave set. It would be of the utmost value to obtain independent\nconfirmation of their results.\nIn this address I have tried to be strictly fair. It will perhaps be\nfelt that the result is an unsatisfactory halting between two opinions.\nI must admit that in the course of study my estimate of the evidence\nhas in several instances tended to become less favourable as I\nproceeded. Nevertheless, in some cases I am still quite unable to\nform any probable guess as to how the investigators could have\nbeen deceived.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 153\nTHE QUESTION OF LIGHTS SUPPOSED TO HAVE\nBEEN OBSERVED NEAR THE POLES OF A MAGNET\nBy Lord Rayleigh, Sc.D., LL.D., F.R.S.\nA QUOTATION from Sir WiUiam Barrett (1924) will fitly introduce the\npresent discussion. He says :\n\" Personally I am very anxious that earnest attention should be\ngiven to the so-called Reichenbach Phenomena, wherein certain\nsensitives after long immersion in complete darkness perceive a\nluminosity emanating from the poles of a magnet, and also from the\nhuman fingers. I have published in the Philosophical Magazine, and\nalso in the early volumes of our own Proceedings, the experiments\nwhich led me to the conviction that such phenomena do really occur\nunder suitable conditions.\" ^\nWhen Barrett speaks of \" perceiving \", he seems to mean visual\nperception which makes use of the physiological mechanism of the\neye. There are several definite reasons for interpreting him in this\nway. One is the mention of long rest in the darkness. It is, of course,\nwell known that visual perception becomes more acute after such\nrest, which may be prolonged with advantage up to at least half an\nhour. Secondly he uses in some of his experiments the test of inter-\nposing an opaque screen between the magnet and the observer,\nwhich was thought to cut off the elfect. If the perception in question\nwere of an extra-sensory nature, there would seem to be no point in\neither rest in the dark or use of an opaque screen. Further it would\n1 Proc.

Reichenbach's original \" Researches \" are known to me in\na translation by Gregory, London 1850. They are quite nneritical.\nB 19\n\f20 The Question of Lights supposed to have been [part\nbe hard to explain the pain in the eyes experienced by one of the\nobservers from the strain of watching in the darlj.\nThe mention of \" sensitives \" suggests that some persons are able\nto see much fainter lights than others. We are reminded of the\n\" hyperaesthesia \" sometimes invoked to explain away apparently\nsuccessful experiments in telepathy. We may at this point usefully\nask what evidence there is that some persons have a far better\nvision for the perception of faint hghts than others ? It is probable\nthat young eyes tend to be better than old ones in this respect.\nFurther, it is certain that some persons are \" night blind But\nsuch cases are definitely pathological. I have not been able to find\nor hear of cases of very exceptional sensitiveness, but if anyone\nclaims to be able to see the Reichenbach phenomenon, he should\ncertainly be tested with ordinary lights to determine whether, and\nif so in what degree, his power of detecting faint sources exceeds the\nordinary. Further discussion of this point is given below.\nBarrett proposed the use of a photographic test, and speaks of\nsome preliminary experiments in this direction but he does not give\nthe impression that the test was pushed to anywhere near its limits.\nWe know definitely that the modern (panchromatic) plate can detect\nall the radiations to which the eye is sensitive, and some others (ultra\nviolet and X-rays) as well. The general experience of astronomers\nshows that when dealing with faint sources photographic exposures\nof a few hours reveal much more than the eye can see. It appeared\nworth while therefore to put the question to a more severe test than\nhas hitherto been applied.\nThe luminous appearances described purport to be seen in the air\nnear the poles of the magnet, and if the problem is regarded as\nsusceptible of scientific treatment at all, it would seem hard to escape\nfrom the conclusion that the luminosity is conditioned by the inten-\nsity of the magnetic field, and by its depth in the direction of vision.\nElectro magnets have certain advantages, but a permanent magnet\nwas preferred. It has the great merit that the plate can be exposed\nto it for any length of time without maintenance, and with no possible\ncomplication arising from the heat of the exciting current, which\nmight possibly lead to certain spurious effects.\nIt is true that an electro magnet is more powerful, but the modern\nmagnet steels have enormously increased the power of permanent\nmagnets, so as largely to discount this consideration.\nIn the experiments I am about to describe, I used a permanent\nmagnet of the kind used for loud speakers (Figs. 1 and 2). It was\nkindly given me by the Atlas and Norfolk Works, Sheffield, through\nthe kind interest of Dr W, H, Hatfield, F.R.S., and was made of the\n\f\f22 The Question of Lights supposed to have been [part\ncobalt magnet steel developed by them. The narrow gap between\nthe poles in magnets of this type is advantageous, since the magnetic\nforce there is very intense, being only a few times less than the\nmaximum attainable with powerful electro magnets.\nFig. 1 shows the face of the magnet. Fig. 2 shows a section through\ntwo of the four arms.\nThe north pole iV is constituted by the central circular piece, and\nthe south pole by the edge of the ring-shaped aperture in which N\nhes. The narrow gap between them is the region of intense magnetic\nforce.\nIt is 26 mm. (about 1 inch) diameter and 1-2 mm. breadth. The\nflux density in the gap was 8000 hues per square cm., and the depth\nof the gap 6-5 mm. The magnet was placed in a light-tight box in a\ndark cellar, and the photographic plate laid on it (P, Fig. 2), with a\nthin film of celluloid sheet C in between. This, however, was not\nused at first.\nLaying a \" hypersensitive \" panchromatic plate directly on the\nmagnet, and exposing for a month, nothing could be detected on\ndevelopment. But on giving a five months' exposure a dark ring\nappeared on the developed plate corresponding to the size of the\ncircular gap ; and I thought at first that it might possibly represent\nthe effect that was being sought. On further examination a similar\ndarkening was noticed in the region outside the magnet, and also\nopposite the screwed holes intended for attaching other parts to the\nmagnet (these holes are indicated in Fig. 1). These regions are not\nthe seat of magnetic force, and therefore the darkening is to be\nreferred to some other cause. It is known that certain vapours give\nrise to a chemical action on the photographic plate, simulating the\naction of light : and in long exposures effects of this kind are always\nto be feared.^ For our present purpose it is not necessary to discuss\nthem further. The point is that part of the plate was protected by\ncontact with the planed face of the steel magnet, and that the other\nparts not so protected were blackened.\nTo guard against this, a sheet of thin cellophane was placed be-\ntween the magnet and the photographic film so as to cover the latter\nall over, and protect it from free access of vapours. Another ex-\nposure of five months was given and the result was definitely nega-\ntive. No trace whatever of the circular area where the magnetic\nforce subsists could be seen on the plate.\nIt would scarcely be practicable to carry out a much more drastic\ntest than this one. It may occur to some readers to ask why the\n1 See W. J. Russel. Froctediiigs of the Royal Society, Vol. 63, p. 102, 1898;\nVol. 64, p. 409, 1899.\n\f153] observed near the Poles of a Magnet 23\nplate was placed in immediate juxtaposition to the supposedly\nluminous layer, instead of using a photographic camera and lens in\nthe ordinary way. Accepted optical principles show that the method\nactually adopted is far the best for making the most of a faint light.\nIn order to test the value of the photographic experiment and to\ncompare it with what can be done visually, trials were made with\na source which really is faintly luminous, the luminosity being fairly\ndistributed through the visual spectrum. This source consists of\npotassium-uranyl sulphate\u2014a substance the luminescence of which\nis permanently maintained under the stimulus of its own shght\nradioactivity\u2014on the same principle as the luminous compound used\nfor watch dials, though the light is much fainter. To reduce the\nbrightness to near the limit of visibility, the substance was finely\npowdered. It was tightly packed in a flat metal box of three inches\ndiameter with a glass lid, and not afterwards disturbed.\nThis source took two hours to produce a definite photographic\nimpression of a black paper stencil, the plate being put right up to it,\nwith the stencil between.^\nFor comparison with the photographic result, the same faint\nsource could be observed visually. The intensity could be pro-\nvisionally reduced by means of sheets of perforated zinc gauze of\nvarying opacities. Three such were provided, coarse, medium and\nfine. The scale of intensities (determined by a photoelectric method)\nwas as follows :\nIntensity Nvntber of Observers\nGauze (relative value) in the Class\nNone - - - - 100 (assumed) 2\nCoarse - - - - 71 8\nMedium - - - - 55 22\nFine - - - - 34 8\nFine + Coarse - - - 24 0\nAt these low intensities the structure of the gauzes could not be\ndiscerned. They only produced a uniform darkening of the visual\nfield. The observers were asked to take the source and gauzes with\nthem on retiring for the night ; to observe only after being at least\nforty minutes in the dark ; and to report what was the least intensity\nwhich they could be quite sure of seeing.\nSince the unscreened source required two hours exposure for a\nphotographic impression, the source screened with the fine gauze,\nwhich represents the faintest light that any of my observers can see,\n1 It may occur to some readers to ask whether the radioactivity of the sub-\nstance might not have vitiated the photographic test. The glass cover was,\nhowever, thick enough to ehminate any error from this cause.\nB2\n\f24 The Question of Lights near the Poles of a Magnet [part 153\nshould require \"2 x hours, or say six hours, to produce one.^\nActually the exposure given to the magnet was one hundred and\nfifty days, which is 600 times more.\nWe find then that the photographic plate as applied is 600 times\nmore effective than even the best visual observers that were met\nwith in this work. The photographic plate cannot detect any\nluminosity ; and it seems quite certain that the claim that any\nvisual observer can do so is imjustified.\nThe results, given in the last column of the table, do not encourage\nthe idea that there are such people as \" sensitives \" who can see\nmuch fainter light than the ordinary man. The largest class are\nthose who could see intensity 55 on my scale. A few could see\nintensity 34. No one could see intensity 24.\nWe do not expect to encounter people of even double the ordinary\nheight. Still less should we expect to find people with hundreds of\ntimes the ordinary capacity for seeing faint lights.\nThere are strong a priori objections to a belief in the Reichenbach\neffect, and also particularly to the claim of some of the observers\nthat they could distinguish between the poles by the colour or\nextent of the luminosity : for in all well tested magnetic phenomena,\nthe poles differ in their behaviour only in respect of sign. But I\nwished to avoid judging the question on a priori grounds.\nThe experiments are regarded as definitely disproving the alleged\neffect. Had there been a luminosity, it could not have failed to come\ninto evidence, even though very much fainter than anything the\neye could detect.\nIn conclusion, we may perhaps ask why the question should have\never been considered to be within the domain of psychical research\nat all ? The earlier workers do not appear to have quite fairly faced\nthe question of whether they supposed the perception to be sensory\nor extra-sensory, though for the reasons explained above, it seems to\nme that on theii' own showing they should have pronounced for\nthe former. This point seems to have been left rather nebulous, and\nthere was thus room for the old ideas about some mysterious rapport\nbetween the magnet and human personahty, which dates from the\ntime of Mesmer, but which has never been satisfactorily proved to\nhave any foundation.\n1 This is on the assumption that for a given photographic density the ex-\nposure time is in inverse ratio to the luminous intensity. This law is nearly\nenough true for the present jjurpose.\n\fA SERMON IN ST PAUL'S ^\nBy Mrs W. H. Salter\nBetween the years 1903 and 1908 my father, the late Professor\nA. W. Verrall of Cambridge, published three essays on the Latin poet\nStatius, whom Dante in the Purgatorio (XXI and XXII) declared\nto have been a convert to Christianity. These essays originally\nappeared in different magazines, but in 1913, after my father's death,\nthey were reprinted in a collection of his essays entitled \" Literary\nEssays, Classical and Modern '\".\nTo two of these essays {To Follovj\nthe Fisherman and Dante on the Baptism of Statius) there were\nallusions in Mrs Willett's scripts of 1912 and 1913 which were the\nsubject of a paper read by Lord Balfour (then Mr Gerald Balfour)\nto the Society on March 27, 1914, and afterwards piibHshed in\nVolume XXVII of Proceedings, pp. 221-243. It is with my father's\nthird essay, The Altar of Mercy, first published in 1907 in the Oxford\nand Cambridge Review, that the present paper is more particularly\nconcerned.\nTo make the point of the paper clear it will be necessary to say a\nword about Statius and to quote some passages from The Altar of\nMercy. Statius, who was born near Naples, then the centre of Greek\nculture in Italy, Hved in the latter half of the first century a.d., and\nhis principal work, The Thebaid, an epic in twelve books, describes\nthe war of the Seven Against Thebes. Half-way through the poem\nthe invading army reach the river Asopus, which forms the frontier\nof Thebes, and finding it swollen, hesitate to cross it : to this passage\nDante refers when making Statius describe his own hesitation to\nreceive baptism. In the two essays referred to by Lord Balfour in\nhis paper, my father had suggested that Dante wished to draw a\nparallel between the delay of the invaders in staying on the other\nside of the Asopus and the delay of Statius in \" staying on the other\nside \" of the river of baptism. Allusions to this point were prominent\nin Mrs Willett's script.\nThe invaders are defeated with great slaughter and the victorious\nThebans refuse to allow their bodies to be buried. The widows of the\nslain repair for justice to Athens, where, says Statius {Thebaid XII),\nis an Altar of Mercy {dementia).\n^ This paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society on September 29,\n1937.\n25\n\f26 lirs W. H. Salter [part\n\" In the midst of the city was an Altar, pertaining not to Might,\nnor the powers thereof, but to gentle Mercy. Mercy there had fixed\nher seat and Misery made it holy. Thither new suppliants came ever\nwithout fail, and found acceptance all. . . .\n\" The ritual takes no tax, accepts no incense-flame, no drench of\nblood, but only the dew of tears upon the stone, and the shorn hair\nof the mourner for a wreath above, and for drapery the cast robe\nwhich sorrow puts away. . . .\n\" Image there is not any ; to no mould of metal is trusted that\nForm Divine, who loves to dwell in minds and hearts. . . .\n\" The legend is that it was the children of Hercules who founded\nthe sanctuary, in the city whose warriors protected them when their\nsire had passed from the pyre to the sky.\n\" So the tale sayeth, but sayeth not worthily. Rather should we\nbelieve that it was those Visitants from Heaven whom Athens had\never made welcome to her soil.\"\n(The above are extracts from my father's translation. Literary\nEssays, p. 227.)\nThe essay called The Altar of Mercy is a commentary on this pas-\nsage of Statius's poem. Since allusions have been made in scripts\nwhich I shall have occasion to mention to parts of the essay, I shall\nnow quote, as briefly as possible, the relevant passages :\n\" What is sohd and evident, what leaps to the eye, is the sentiment\nof the whole passage, the spirit, the general conception of religion\nfrom which it proceeds. For this there is only one suitable word. It\nis exactly that sentiment to which Christianity appealed. To console\nthe miserable and guilty, to heal the wounds of the world and the\nsense of sin\u2014these are the offices of that Altar to which Statins\ndirects the worship of Manliind. '\nI will have mercy and not sacri-\nfice '\n;\n'\nCome unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy-laden '\n: for\nsuch inscriptions and such only, the shrine of his imagination is\nprepared. . . .\n\" For the venerable legend associated with it, the story of Hercules\nand his children, he has nothing but scorn. The Altar of his thought\nwas not founded by the children of Hercules, nor in fact by any\nearthly hand. Like other such emblems of aspiration, it was '\nnever\nbuilt at all, and therefore built for ever '.\n. . .\n\" And in the thought of the poet it stands alone. We cannot mjss\nnor misunderstand the sweeping depreciation by which, in com-\nparison with this Deity of the Soul, and with the uncostly sacrifice of\na broken heart, the whole art and ritual of polytheistic superstition\nare waved away. . . .\n\" It is certainly not from the actual leaders of the Christian move-\n\f153] A Sermcni in St PauVs 27\nment that we shall learn to depreciate the importance of its relation\nto that species of thought whose ideal centre was the Areopagus of\nAthens. '\nWhom therefore ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I\nimto you. ... Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are\nexceedingly God-fearing.' To an exhaustive commentary on these\nwords, and upon the discourse which follows them no small contribu-\ntion should be furnished by the Thebaid.\"\nMy father was born on February 5, 1851, and on February 5,\n1912, the ilhiess from which he had long been suffering took a\ndecided and noticeable turn for the worse ; he died on June 18 of the\nsame year. For a double reason therefore February 5 was a memor-\nable day in his Hfe, and for the remaining years of my mother's life,\nthat is the years 1913 to 191G inclusive, she made a practice of\nseeking to obtain automatic writing on each February 5, and also on\nthe 4th and 6th. The scripts so produced form a natural group,\nbeing united both by the intentions of the automatist, and by inter-\nnal links which I could not within the scope of this paper completely\nset out. I wish, however, to emphasise this matter of internal link-\nage. The point has been made that evidence of any supernormal\ncontent in the scripts is weakened, if not destroyed, by arbitrary\nselection of a few scripts, regarded as relevant, from a large irrelevant\nmass. This objection would be valid, if the scripts tmre arbitrarily\nselected. But this is not the case. The problem as it presents itself\nto the student of scripts is this : here are a number of scripts which\nare obviously and normally linked together, e.g. by date, or by the\nrepetition in them of a phrase or topic which does not occur else-\nwhere in the general mass of scripts. Taking these scripts as a\nnatural group, do we find in them any evidence of supernormal\ncognisance or intent ? This question has been discussed by Mr J. G.\nPiddington in Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXIII, pp. 443ff.\nAs I am now about to quote from my mother's scripts, I wish to\nmake it perfectly clear that I do not consider the fact that the scripts\nrefer to events in my father's Hfe or to passages in his books as in any\nway supernormal or even remarkable. I quote them as they are\npart of a story the significance of which flows from the actions of\nother persons.^\nM. V. script of February 4, 1913, opens with these words :\n^ It should, however, be noted that my mother frequently did not herself\nrecognise that her scripts were referring to passages in my father's writings and\nI beUeve she never recognised that she had alluded to The Altar of Mercy. I\nbelieve this tendency of automatists not to see in their own productions a\nmeaning which is subsequently recognised by others is of common occurrence.\n\f28 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nOranges and lemons\u2014and the rhyme in St Clemens\u2014San Clemente\nwith the mosaics. No wait\u2014you have it wrong Clementia et\nmisericordia sorores [Mercy and Pity sisters].\nA later script of April 5, 1914, opens with the words :\nOranges and lemons say the bells of St Clements St Clements Danes\nand the name of this church is repeated a few lines later in the same\nscript. My mother associated the name with \" Danes Inn \" (in the\nneighbourhood of the church), where my father resided for three\nyears. The script therefore combines three references to my father:\nin the date, in the imphed allusion to Danes Irm, and in the word\n\" Clementia \", the name Statins gives to the Deity to whom the\nAltar of Mercy was dedicated. The word \" mosaics \" recurs in the\nscripts next to be quoted.\nM. V. script of February 6, 1914, begins as follows :\nPen or feather\u2014penna\u2014the wings of the dove\u2014silver and gold\nAnd one of Michael Angelo's prophets holds a great pen\u2014Combine\nthat with the \" twain \" with which he covered his face. I think I\nhave now made clear what was not understood in a script of yours\nof long ago, about St Mark's golden-tipped pen which wrote with-\nout his conscious aid.\nThe script of long ago was one written by my mother in October\n1905 in which mention was made of an angel giving St Mark a\nwinged pen. In her script of February 6, 1914, there is, it is true,\nno explicit reference to mosaics, but I shall presently explain why\nthere may well be an imphcit one. But before doing so I will quote\nthe last of this series of birthday scripts, my mother's script of\nFebruary 4, 1915\n:\nTill I have built Jerusalem in England's green and pleasant land.\nThere is still much building to be done\u2014building without hands\n\u2014\nfor the City that will be an abiding City the true eternal City\ncrowned with the olive wreath. Fortress and fostress of sons born\nfree [Swinburne's Erechtheua] Combine these ideas The Roman Im-\nperial City and the free Athens.\nThis script, like the twelfth book of Statius's poem presents the\npicture of an idealised Athens, and in the words \" building without\nhands \", taken in conjunction with an earlier script of my mother's,\nJanuary 21, 1913, which speaks of \"an altar not made with hands \",\nthere seems to be a clear reference to the passage in which my father\nsays of the Altar of Mercy that \"Like other such emblems of\naspiration it was '\nnever built at all, and therefore built for ever ' \".\nThat there should be references to my father and his writings in\n\f153] A Sermon in St PcmVs 29\nmy mother's scripts is. as I have said, nothing extraordinary, but it\nis, I think, curious, in view of facts shortly to be related, that the\n\" birthday scripts\n\"'\nof 1913 and 1915 both alluded to a particular\nessay, The Altar ofMercy, and that the scripts of the intervening year\ncontain allusions which my mother, as the sequel shows, connected\nwith a mosaic of St Mark in St Paul's Cathedral.\nIn quoting from a script of 1915 I have departed from the chrono-\nlogical order to which I now return.\nOn March 24, 1914, my mother, who was staying at Guildford\nwith a friend, came to Woking in order that Lord Balfour might read\nprivately to her the paper already mentioned in which are discussed\nreferences in Mrs Willett's scripts to my father's essays To Follow the\nFisherman and Dante on the Baptism of Statins. This paper was to\nbe read at a meeting of the Society at 4 p.m. on March 27, 1914.\nMy mother did not feel inchned to be present at a meeting at which\nevidence of my father's post mortem agency was to be presented and\ndiscussed, but she wished to attend the Council Meeting to be held\nat 6 p.m. on that day. Her friend at Guildford had suggested to her\nthat she ought to go to St Paul's Cathedral to hear the Lenten\nmusic, Allegri\"s Miserere, which was being performed there, and it\noccurred to my mother that this would be an appropriate way to\nspend the time of the meeting. In her diary for March 29, 1914, she\nrecords her visit thus :\n\" On March 27th from 4.15 to 5 I was in St\nPaul's (for the first time !) to hear AUegri's Miserere. There came\na gleam of sunhght on the St Mark, and I wondered if he held a\ngolden pen. but it was too far off to see.\" By \" the St Mark \" my\nmother referred to the mosaic of that saint in the series designed by\nSir Wilham Richmond, and was also clearly referring back to her\nscripts of October 1905 and February 6, 1914, already mentioned.\nMiserere is the name given to the fifty-first Psalm, the Vulgate ver-\nsion of which begins Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magmm miseri-\ncordiam tuam. Verses 16 and 17 in the Prayer Book version are as\nfollows :\n\" For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee :\nbut thou dehghtest not in burnt offerings. The sacrifice of God is a\ntroubled spirit : a broken and contrite heart, 0 God, shalt thou not\ndespise.\" This is one of the scriptural passages quoted or referred\nto in the essay on The Altar of Mercy :\n\" In comparison with this\nDeity of the Soul and with the uncostly sacrifice of a broken heart,\nthe whole art and ritual of polytheistic superstition are waved\nawav.\"'\nLord Balfour's paper, which it is to be observed, neither deals\nwith nor makes mention of The Altar of Mercy, but only of my\nfather's other two essays on Statins, was published in July 1914 in\n\f30 Mrs W. H. Salter [PAET\nPart 69 of Proceedings. This Part and Part 70 contain several other\npapers discussing it.\nThe paper was read at the time of its pubhcation by Mrs Stuart\nWilson, who had been for many years an Associate of the Society.\nWhen in the Journal for February 1915, an appeal was made for\nMembers to offer themselves for experiments in thought-transference\nMrs Wilson responded, and she and I undertook a series of experi-\nments which I reported on in a paper published in Vol. XXIX of\nProceedings, p. 306.\nMrs Wilson, who is an American by birth, was the wife of Briga-\ndier-General Charles Stuart Wilson, C.B., of the Royal Engineers.\nMy first acquaintance with her was through her response to the\nappeal of February 1915. She never knew either my father or my\nmother, and she had not, at the date of the experience I am about to\nrelate, read either The Altar of Mercy or any other of my father's\nwritings.\nConcerning Mrs Wilson's automatism, readers of the paper referred\nto above will realise that she and I obtained several cross-corres-\npondences of considerable interest : I may mention in particular the\nconnections between her impressions of May 16 and June 4, 1915,\nand my script of June 4, 1915, on the subject of Der Tod als Freuml\n(Death the Friend) and Sintram {Proc, Vol. XXIX, p. 324). Al-\nthough little has been published since concerning Mrs Wilson, she\nhas continued to record her impressions from time to time and has\nbecome an important member of \" the S.P.R. group of automatists \".\nTo remind my readers of the nature of Mrs Wilson's automatism,\nI will quote a passage from my report of the 1915 experiments :\nMrs Wilson's procedure is as follows : ha^^ng provided herself\nwith pencil and paper, she lies down in the dark and lapses almost at\nonce into a light stage of hypnosis. In this condition a series of very\nvivid mental pictures present themselves to her, amounting some-\ntimes to visual lialhicinations. Not infrequently she hears a voice,\nit may be her own voice or the voice of some other unknown person.\nOn some occasions the voice also has been completely externalised as\nan auditory hallucination.\n\" Mrs Wilson makes brief notes of her impressions at the conclusion\nof the experiment ;\nsometimes, after she thinks the experiment is\nover, she has some further impressions, which are duly noted. Once\nor twice it has happened that the impressions have taken the form of\na vivid dream during ordinary sleep of which Mrs Wilson has noted\nas much as she could remember on waking. The detailed records\nwhich she sent to me were based on her own contemporary notes,\nand were usually written out on the day following the experiments.\n\f153] A Sermon in St Paul's 31\nThese records have all been preserved, together with the postmarks\nshowuig the dates upon which they were despatched.\"\nI should like to emphasise the point that Mrs AA^ilson's own\npersonal associations were quite apart from mine or my mother's.\nThe objection has sometimes been made that the S.P.R. automatists\nknew each other too well, and were too nmch, as it were, \" in the\nsame set.\" This objection does not apply to Mrs Wilson. Up to\nthe time when she and I began to experiment, her closest links, as I\nhave said, were with America and with the British Army, and\nfor some years before the outbreak of war in 1914 she had been\nHving abroad. Mrs Wilson and I could not be said to know each\nother well until after the incidents and scripts discussed in this\npaper.\nOn February 15, 1916, Mrs Wilson wrote to me as follows :\n\" I\nhave been meaning to write about the following incident ever since\nit occurred, but my husband has been home on leave, and I have had\nno time. On Sunday morning February 6th I woke up feeling that\nI must go to the morning service at St Paul's Cathedral. I have\nnever been to a service there before, or wanted to go. As I lay\nmeditating the matter, I got a visual impression of what I took for\nbus 13, which I often take to Regent's Park. I wondered why, as it\nran in quite a wrong direction for St Pauls. It was only when really\nstarted for church, that I discovered that the bus I wanted was 15,\nand only when I saw it commg, that I realised that with my astig-\nmatism 13 and 15 looked identical at a short distance. Of course I\nexpected to find a long-lost friend, or a German spy, or some one\nreally interesting, sitting near me, either in the bus or in church,\nbut there was not a soul I knew, or any one of the shghtest interest.\nI was in a very absent-mmded mood, and the service seemed to go\nvery fast. I heard the first words of the sermon and no more, until\nI heard the preacher say, \" Be careful that like Statins you do not\nlinger too long upon the brink.\"\" That attracted my attention,\nbecause, except in the S.P.R. Proceedings last spring, I had never\nconsciously heard of Statius. Certainly never apart from the S.P.R.\nliterature. Oh. I said to myself, I suppose that is what I came for.\nAfterw^ards it seemed a little puzzling to decide whether the words\nhad really been said by the clergyman or I had evolved them from\nmy own mind, and that is a question, my dear Mrs Salter, that only\nthe man who preached can settle, and I for one should not like to ask\nhim. He cannot, I think, have mentioned the name [i.e. Statius]\nbefore, as it would probably have brought me to attention at\nonce.\n, Last night [February 14, 1916] I was getting a lot of impressions,\n\f32 J\/rs W. H. Salter [part\nbut I can only remember a very wide and turbulent river, and a man\nsitting near it who looked lil^e St John the Divine in his youth.\nThere was also some one of the same sort on the other side, but old\nand with a grey beard, I think.\"\nMy contemporary record of my reply acknowledging this letter is\nas follows : \"I told Mrs Wilson that her experience was appropri-\nately timed, Feb. 5 being my father's bii'thday.\" The occasion was\nmore appropriate than I then realised, as I had not seen my mother's\n\" birthday scripts \" of February 4, 5, 6, 1913, 1914, 1915.\nOn February 18, 1916, Mrs Wilson wrote to me as follows :\n\" I have looked up the name of the preacher at St Paul's on\nSunday, February the 6th, at the morning service, and find it was\nDr Nairne. Even if he did preach of Statins [i.e. if the words Mrs\nWilson thought she heard were actually spoken and not a subjective\nimpression], it looks like some sort of telepathy, that I should have\nfelt impelled to go and hear him.\"\nThe Dr Nairne in question was the Rev. Dr Alexander Nairne, a\nCambridge Classical Scholar, and later Regius Professor of Divinity\nat Cambridge : he was personally known to ray father and mother.\nOn February 23, 1916, I wrote to him as follows :\n\" A friend of mine, a lady with whom I have lately been doing\nsome experiments in thought-transference, attended morning service\nin St Paul's on February 6 and heard you preach there. She thinks\nthat in your sermon you made allusion to Statins, whom she associ-\nates in her mind with an essay on Dante by my father, the late\nProfessor Verrall. But her recollection on this point is not perfectly\nclear, and I should like to ascertain definitely whether she is right in\nattributing the allusion to you. Could you therefore tell me wdiether\nin your sermon on February 6 you referred to Statins and spoke of\nhim as '\nfingering on the brink '\n?\n\"\nDr Nairne replied on February 24, 1916 :\n' In the sermon (Feb. G) of which you wrote, I aUuded to Statins\nand any one who had read Dr Verrall's essay would have known that\nI liad it in uund. But I am as sure as I can be without a written\nrecord of the sermon that 1 did not speak of Statins '\nlingering on the\nbrink \".\nThat would\u2014as far as I can remember, and I have fittle\ndoubt upon this\u2014have had no point in the sermon. I just spoke of\nDante thinking him Christian but it was the '\naltar of pity '\nnot\nStatins himself I was concerned with. . . .\n\" I am yours very truly,\n\"Alex. Nairne.\n\"After writing this I feel uneasy about the strength of the denial.\n\f153] A Sermon in St Paul's 33\nIf the phrase '\nlingering too long upon the brink ' is in the essay I\nfeel that it is possible that I may have used it unconsciously. That\nhappens so often. I will ask a friend who was present if he remem-\nbers.\"\nOn February 28, 1916, Dr Nairne wrote me the followmg post-\ncard :\n\" '\nLingering too long upon the brink.' The friend I spoke of is\nalmost certain I did not use those words.\"\nDr Nairne speaks of \" Dr Verrall's essay \", but as I have already\npointed out, there are three essays on Statius. Dr Nairne was \" con-\ncerned \" in his sermon with one essay, The Altar of Mercy : Mrs Wil-\nson knew nothing of this essay, but erroneously thought that she\nheard a mention of the main subject of the other two essays, of\nwhich she had indirect knowledge through Lord Balfour's paper,\nthough she had never seen them herself.\nTo sum up : at the time of Mrs Wilson's fir-st attendance at a ser-\nvice at St Paul's there already existed, quite unknown to her, the\nfollowing connections :\n(1) Between the date of her attendance, February 6, and the essay\nThe Altar of Mercy, through the passages already noted in my\nmother's scripts of February 4-6 in the years following my father's\ndeath.\n(2) Between that date and St Paul's Cathedral, owing to references\nin the same scripts which my mother attributed to the mosaic seen by\nher in St Paul's on March 27, 1914, the date of her first visit there.\n(3) Between St Paul's Cathedral and my father's other essays on\nStatius, owing to my mother's visit there while Lord Balfour's paper\nwas being read to the Society.\nMrs Wilson's experience of February 6, 1916, seems to me to draw\ntogether into one these pre-existing connections : for the first time,\nthe date, the place and this particular essay, The Altar of Mercy,\noccur together. Sermons in St Paul's on Statius are, I fancy, rare,\nand sermons inspired by my father's essay on Statius's Altar of\nMercy perhaps rarer still : ought I to apologise for not being pre-\npared with statistics of their frequency ?\nThe coincidence is the more noteworthy when we bear in mind that\nMrs Wilson's visit to St Paul's was the first time she had ever\nattended a service there and my mother's visit the only time she was\never there at all.\nI leave it to members of this Society to judge whether the im-\npulse which induced Mrs Wilson to go to St Paul's on February 6,\n1916, and so to hear a sermon on The Altar of Mercy was wholly\nfortuitous.\n\f34 Mrs W.

The element of cross-corres-\npondence is not, I think, lacking, but my purpose is not to stress this\nbut to give illustrations of a process frequently employed in the\nscripts.\nThis being my intention, 1 shall follow the example set by some\nwriters of detective stories and state at the outset the answer to the\nproblem, and then go back to the begmning and show the steps in its\nsolution. The answer in this case is that the scripts, taken as a body,\nshow clear evidence of intention not only to refer to the topic\n\" lighthouse \", but to lay strong emphasis on it. But the topic was\nwrapped up in such a way that during the period to which I am\nreferring, that is to say until June 1915, neither I nor my mother\nrealised this intention.\n\f153] A Sermon in St PauVs 35\nIn a script of September 20, 1908, I wrote some automatic verse\n(whicli I do not commend for its literary merit !) as follows :\nBy the ocean shore where the billows roar\nWhen the West AVind wields his flail.\nAnd seagirt rock scarce bides the shock,\nWoe for the vessels frail.\nA broken spar by the harbour bar\nLies tossing in the foam\nThe wave-tost bell rings out the knell\nOf those who come not home.\nI wlU next quote from two scripts written on consecutive days in\nSeptember 1911. On September 11, I wrote :\nThe midnight sun and northern lights . . . the hght leaped Hke a\nliving thing . . . and great whales go sailing by round the world for\never and aye.\nand on September 12 :\nMutantur omnia irrevocabile tempus (all things change time which\ncannot be recalled) . . . the evening light and drowsy tinklings lull\nthe distant folds a stormy haven Three fishers went sailing.\nOn June 18, 1915, I was staying with my mother at Cambridge.\nIn the evening we both wrote scripts, she writing before me. I did\nnot, however, see her script till a month later. I will quote my\nscript first\n:\nAequora ponti (the waters of the sea) \u2014the great deep\u2014the deep\ncalls\u2014a land of many harbours\u2014three fishers went sailing\u2014one\nclear call.\nThat completes the tale of my own scripts that I propose to quote\nin connection with this approach to the lighthouse topic. I wish to\nemphasise that they form a natural group, bemg united by internal\nlinks which I shall shortly explain. But first I will quote my mother's\nscript of June 18, 1915, written, I repeat, before my script of the\nsame date :\nBells ringing in the darkness of the night ringing till the grey dawn\nrises Mary, go and call the cattle home\u2014and the bells of Enderby\nThe Bell Buoy Rock No I can't get it clearer\u2014leave it tonight.\nIt will be noted that the word \" hghthouse \" does not occur in any\nof the scripts quoted, nor, I think, would the idea \" Hghthouse\n\"\nreadily suggest itself to a reader, but if the Hterary allusions implicit\nin the scripts are traced and combined, the hghthouse topic emerges\nclearly enough.\n\f36 Mrs W. H. Salter [PABT\nThe most obvious link between my scripts is Kingsley's poem The\nThree Fishers. The opening words of this poem are quoted in my\nscripts of September 12, 1911, and June 18, 1915, and my script of\nSeptember 20, 1908, contains phrases reminiscent of the same poem.\nThe poem consists of three stanzas, of which the first opens thus :\nThree fishers went saihng out into the West,\nOut into the West as the sun went down.\nThe second stanza opens :\nThree women sat up in the lighthouse tower\nThe third:\nThree corpses lay out on the shining sands\nand each stanza ends with mention of the \" harbour bar and its\nmoaning \".\nReferences to this poem may, in view of the second stanza, be\nlighthouse references, but they are not necessarily so ; and in fact\nthe one topic which appears on the surface in all of my scripts except\nthe second, and still more emphatically in my mother's scripts, is that\nof bells. My first script has \" wave-tost bell \" ;\nmy third leaves for\na moment the sea association and gives sheep bells at evening,\n\" drowsy tinilings lull the distant folds,\" and then returning to the\nsea \" the stormy haven\u2014three fishers went sailing \". The fourth\nscript introduces by the words \" one clear call \" a reference to\nTennyson's Crossing the Bar, the third stanza of which begins\n\" Twihght and evening bell and my mother's script is all about\nbells, bells ringing in the darkness of night, the bells of Enderby, the\nBell Buoy Rock.\nCombined with these in my mother's script is a quotation from\nanother well-known poem of Kingsley's The Smids of Dee. Like his\nThree Fishers, it is a tale of drowning ofi' the coast, but in this case it\nis a girl who is drowned. It thus forms a convenient transition be-\ntween The Three Fishers and The Bells of Enderby, mentioned in\nJean Ingelow's poem High. Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire, in which\nalso a girl is drowned in the rising tide. But whereas The Three\nFishers has a lighthouse but nothing about bells, Jean Ingelow's\npoem gives bells without the lighthouse, although there is in it a\nreference to a church-tower which acts as a \" beacon-light to sailors \".\nThe lighthouse association is therefore still not unnfistakably\nestablished.\n^ The first stanza has \" And may there be no moaning at the bar \", thereby\nlinking up with The Three Fishers.\n\f153] A Sermon in St Pa id's 37\nThere remain to be considered the second script of niy series, that\nof September 11, 1911, and two phrases, one in my script of Septem-\nber, 12, 1911, \" irrevocabile tempus,\" and one in my mother's\nscript of June 18, 1915. \" The Bell Buoy Rock.\" These two phrases\nhave a close association of a very curious kind, and that association\nis \" hghthouse \"'.\n\" The Bell Buoy Rock \" was at the time identified by my mother\nwith the Bell Rock or Inchcape Rock off the east coast of Scotland.\nBetween 1807 and 1811 a hghthouse was built there by Robert\nStevenson : before that there had been a bell attached to a frame-\nwork which was moved by the waves (hence the name of the rock),\nand when the hghthouse was built, the machinery in it was arranged\nto ring two bells in foggy weather. Note the appropriate phrases\n\" sea-girt rock and \" wave-tost bell \" in my first script, which does\nnot anywhere imply that the more common arrangement of a bell\nbuoy is being described.\nIn the summer of 1814 the Commissioners of Northern Lights, the\nbody responsible for all the lighthouses in Scotland, made an official\ntour of inspection of hghthouses in the northern part of Scotland,\nincluding the Orkneys and Shetlands. One of the unofficial mem-\nbers of the party was Sir Walter Scott, who kept a diary of the tour\n(printed in full in Lockhart's Life of Scott, Vol. Ill, pp. 136-277).\nScott jestingly heads the diary \"Voyage in the Lighthouse Yacht to\nNova Zembla and the Lord knows where \". The party left Leith on\nJune 29 and on the evening of the first day Scott \" watched the\nprogress of the ship round Fifeness, and the revolving motion of the\nnow distant Bell Rock light until the Avind grew rough and the\nlandsmen sick \". Early next day the party were put ashore and\nwent over the lighthouse, which is described at some length. My\nmother, the day after she wote her script of June 18, 1915, noted\nthat she had read Lockhart's Life of Scott and knew that Scott had\nvisited the Bell Rock Lighthouse.\nOn September 8, 1814, the tour ended at Greenock, where Scott\nwent ashore, and he closed his diary with words expressing the\npleasure he had had. and the necessity of returning to work : \"we\nhad constant exertion, a succession of wild and uncommon scenery,\ngood humour on board, and objects of animation and interest when\nwe went ashore\n\u2014\nSed fugit interea, fugit irrevocabile tempus.''\nThere you have the connection between \" Bell Buoy Rock \" in my\nmother's script and \" irrevocabile tempus \" in my script of Septem-\nber 11, 1911. The one refers to an incident at the very beginning of\n\f38 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nScott's tour, the other to the last w ords of the diary describing the\ntour, the whole object of which was to inspect lighthouses. Scott's\nLatin tag, wliich is, of course, a quotation, is the 284th line of Vergil's\nThird Georgic : or rather it is a misquotation, for the texts of Vergil\nhave \" irreparabile tempus while Scott has \" irrevocabile \" } That\nni}' script perpetuates Scott's error shows that it was referring to his\nquotation and not gi^dng a direct quotation of a line of Vergil with\nwhich in my normal state I am familiar. It also shows that the\nscripts, which are sometimes charged with nebulous vagueness, can on\noccasions be as precise, even in small details, as any one could desire.\nSeveral phrases in my scripts are appropriate to the diary, though\nnot indubitable references to it. Such for example are \" a stormy\nhaven in my script of September 12, 1911, and \" a land of many\nharbours in my script of June 18, 1915 ;\npossibly also the \" great\nwhales\" of my script September 11, 1911, as Scott makes several\nreferences to the whaling industry. But of special interest are the\nwords in this script \" The Midnight sun and northern lights \". Scott\ndid not go far enough north to see the midnight sun : in a poem\nwritten during the tour he speaks of islands\n\" Where late the sun scarce vanished from the sight\nAnd his bright pathway graced the short-lived night \".\nBut if he had gone to Nova Zembla in fact, not only in jest, he\nwould of course have reached the latitude of the midnight sun.\nMore certain is the phrase \" Northern Lights which has a double\nmeaning and is, I think, used in the scripts precisely for its am-\nbiguity. It may mean the Aurora Borealis, a subject naturally\nmentioned in association with the midnight sun. But \" Com-\nmissioners of Northern Lights \" is the name Scott gives the Board\non whose yacht he made his tour. If my interpretation is right, an\nallusion to lighthouses is thus surreptitiously introduced in a phrase\napparently referring to celestial phenomena.\nI am certain that at the date of these two scripts of September\n1911, 1 had never read Scott\"s diary of 1814, and that I did not know\nthat he had there quoted, or misquoted, the Vergilian line. My\nmother, who saw both scripts on September 12, 1911, very possibly\nremembered Scott's misquotation, as at some date that I do not\nknow she read the diary. But her knowledge of my scripts of\n^ The misquotation (\" fugit irrevocabile tempus '\") reappears in The Heart of\nMidloihum (first published 1818) in Chapter XII, where the words are put into\nthe mouth of Butler, then in prison. But whereas the context of the scripts is\nentirely appropriate to the diary, it is quite inappropriate to the situation in\nthe novel in which the misquotation occurs : this sufficiently appears from the\nscripts I have quoted.\n\f153] A Serni07i in St PauVs 39\nSeptember 11 and 12, 1911, would not account for the fact that on\nJune 18, 1915, she wrote a script Unked with them in the manner\nalready explained, whilst on the same evening, I, writing quite\nindependently, produced a script also Hnked in the clearest possible\nway with the same scripts. However, as I said earlier, my object\nis not to stress elements of cross-correspondence, but to illustrate a\nmethod which would lose little interest if it had no relation to cross-\ncorrespondences.\nIn the other instance which I shall now relate. Members of the\nSociety may be reheved to learn that I shall steer clear of the Classics\naltogether and not bring in even a Vergihan tag. Two nursery\nrhymes and a short story and some verses by one of the best-known\nwriters of our time are practically the whole hterature involved.\nWith one exception all the scripts were written in the first few\nmonths of 1914. \" Lighthouse \" is again the hidden goal.\nThe one script not written in this period is my script of December\n15, 1908, which ends :\n\" A carAdng knife\u2014three bhnd mice\u2014a single\nthread.\" For five years the mice topic was dormant in my scripts,\nnot emerging till January 1914. In a script of January 21, 1914,\noccur the words, \" A golden boat a poem something about the moon\nand a golden boat,\" with a drawing of a crescent moon.\nOn January 28, 1914, my script had the words :\nThe golden boat\u2014something about the masts being of silver\n\u2014\nit is an English poem\u2014we have tried to quote it twice before\u2014to\nsail upon the sea\u2014last night the moon had a silver rim three blind\nmice\u2014yes, write it down\u2014I wish you could find that poem.\nOn February 4, 1914, come the words :\nThe masts were all of silver\u2014the crew were mice.\nThese scripts made it perfectly clear (though I did not myself\nappreciate this at the time) that the poem referred to the nursery\nrhyme called The Fairy Ship, of which several slightly variant\nversions exist. I shall give that which was famiUar to me as a child :\nA ship, a ship a-saiUng\nA-saihng on the sea ;\nAnd it was deeply laden\nWith pretty things for me.\nThere were raisins in the cabin\nAnd almonds in the hold ;\nThe sails were made of satin\nAnd the mast it was of gold.\n\f40 Mrs W. H. Salter [part\nThe four and twenty sailors\nThat stood between the decks\nWere four and twenty white mice\nWith rings about their necks ; ,- -\nThe Captain was a duck, a duck :\n\u2022\n. . . , :\nWith a jacket on his back, \u2022. i\nAnd when the fairy ship set sail . \u2022 :\n\u2022\nThe Captain he said. Quack !\nThe trail had been confused by reminiscences of another poem well-\nknown to me since childhood, a poem called The Fairy Boat, by T.\nHood. It begins :\nA lake and a fairy boat\nTo sail in the moonlight clear,\nand accounts for allusions in the scripts to the moon, which plays no\npart in the nursery rhyme. The \" three blind mice \" are, I suppose,\nintroduced to bring in the topic of mice in a nursery rhyme setting,\nand to indicate by a reference back to my script of December 15,\n1908, that this was a previous, but unsuccessful attempt to introduce\nthe topic of The Fairy Ship.\nAlthough Lord Balfour and Mr Piddington, who had been studying\nmy scripts, identified the \" poem \" as TJie Fairy Ship, they were\nat a loss to understand why so much trouble was being taken to drag\nit in. It happened that about a week after my script of February 4,\n1914, my mother, who did not know of the references in my scripts\nto The Fairy Ship, was staying at Fishers Hill (Lord Balfour's house).\nDame Edith Lyttelton was also there and was to do some experi-\nments in automatic writing with my mother. At Lord Balfour's\nsuggestion Dame Edith on February 12, 1914, put the following\nquestion out loud to my mother while she was waiting for automatic\nscript to come, in the hope that the answer might throw some light\non why the nursery rhyme had been dragged in : ,\n,\n\" Have you anything to say about these lines\nAnd when the ship began to move\nThe Captain cried Quack Quack ?\n\"\nAfter this question had been put my mother's script began :\nThe Old Moulmein Pagoda\u2014Eastern scents and eastern sounds\n\u2014\nBells upon the breeze.\nThe relevance of this answer is not immediately obvious, nor was it\ndiscovered until many years later Mr Piddington happened to read\nKiphng's short story The Disturber of the Traffic. But its relevance\n\f153] A Sermon in St Paul's 41\nis apparent when we consider the following points : the reference\nin my mother's script was to a poem by Kiphng called Mandalay,\nwhich speaks of \" the old Moulmein Pagoda, looking eastward to the\nsea \" and emphasises the topic of bells,^ which in the scripts I have\nquoted above was closely interwoven with the lighthouse topic. This\nwas evidently an approach (probably the best the automatist could\ndo) to the real answer to the question, The Disturber of Traffic.\nKipling's story is a story of the eastern seas told in a lighthouse on\nthe Enghsh coast by the lighthouse keeper about a man who tended\na lighthouse in the Dutch East Indies. He goes mad and has to be\ntaken away in a survey ship's boat :\n\" When Dowse [the madman]\nwas in the boat, he found, so he says, he couldn't speak to the sailors\n'cept to call them '\nwhite mice with chains about their neck '\nand\nLord knows he hadn't seen or thought of white mice since he was a\nlittle bit of a boy with them in his handkerchief. . . . Then he heard\nthe Captain talking to him very kind . . . but all he could do was to\nkeep his eyes on the rigging and sing\n\u2014\nI saw a ship a-saiUng\n, ,\n.\n;\n;\nA-sailing on the sea\nAnd oh, it was all lading\nWith pretty things for me\nThen he remembered that was foohsliness, and he started off the\nsaying about the Ombay Passage but all he said was\u2014The Captain\nwas a duck\u2014meaning no offence to you.

Quack, quack !\n\"\nIt might be interesting to enquire how many people with a good\nknowledge of modern English literature would be able to answer the\nquestion, \" Where is a story about a lighthouse combined with a\nquotation from the Nursery Rhyme about a Fairy Ship whose\ncrew were mice ?\n\" I put this question to my audience at the\nSociety's meeting at which this paper was read, but I got no answer.\nIn conclusion I may say something about the first explicit reference\nto a lighthouse in my script, which was not made until April 27, 1918.\nIt was made in this form :\n\" Dominus illuminatio mea\n\u2014\n(fxxpos\n\"\n^ \" For the wind is in the palm-trees, and the temple bells they say. ...\"\n\" An' the sunshine and the palm-trees an' the tinkly temple bells ; . . ,\n\"\n\" For the temple bells are callin, an' it's there that I would be\n\u2014\n\" By the old Movdinein Pagoda, looking lazy at the sea,\"\n\f42 Mrs W. H. Salter [part 153]\n(fyixpo? means the famous lighthouse at Alexandria. \" Dominus\nilluminatio mea \" is a reference back to a script of mine written\nexactly ten years earlier, on April 27, 1908. This script has \" Dom-\ninus illuminatio mea A golden harp \".\n\" A golden harp \" is mentioned once again, and once only, in all\nmy scripts, and that is in my script of March 24, 1914. Mr Pidding-\nton was present while this script was being written, and in the course\nof it this question was asked him :\n\" Is it clear about the silver sails, etc ?\n\"\nI now quote the record of what followed this question :\nJ. G. P. I can't say it is clear. I know the poem that is meant\n[i.e. The Fairy Ship].\nwe will try to say more later\n\u2014\nJ. G. P. Right. I want to give a message. Can I give it now?\nWait a minute\n\u2014\na golden harp\u2014we wanted to say that\u2014Now the message\nObserve how permission to give the message is not granted until\nthe words \" a golden harp \" have been added, the object of the\naddition being to connect The Fairy Ship with \"Dominus illuminatio\nmea A golden harp \" in my script of April 27, 1908.\nWhen \" Dominus illuminatio mea \" is repeated on April 27, 1918,\nit is immediately followed by a reference to the Pharos at Alexandria.\nThis combination of \" Dominus illuminatio mea \" with the Pharos\nmay be taken as the fulfilment of the intention expressed in my\nscript of March 24, 1914 : \"we will try to say more later.\"\nThese facts, besides furnishing another example of how topics\nemerge in scripts, go to show that long before it was realised that\nreferences to The Fairy Ship mean the lighthouses mentioned in\nKipling's story, the intelligence responsible for my scripts was aware\nof a close connection between The Fairy Ship and the lighthouse\ntopic.\n\f\\\nPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 154\nREPORT ON A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WITH\nMRS EILEEN GARRETT\nBy K. M. Goldney and S. G. Soal\nPART I\nAN EXAMINATION INTO PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES\nALLEGED TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE TRANCE\nSTATE\nBy K. M. Goldney\nI. Introduction\nBefore Mr Soal and I give our report of the experiments carried\nout by us with Mrs Garrett in London during 1937, I will shortly\nmention a few facts concerning her mediumship.\nMrs Eileen Garrett is one of the best known of our EngHsh\nmental mediums, and has come to occupy a unique position inasmuch\nas she has placed herself of late years in the hands of scientific\ninvestigators who have been at hberty to carry out experiments in\nwhatever way they wished, without restriction.\nMrs Garrett tells me that she first became aware of psychic\npowers as a child, and that she started upon her career as a profes-\nsional medium at the age of 30. She has worked as a medium on\nthe staff of the London Spiritualist Alhance and of the British\nCollege of Psychic Science. She has worked for Mr Harry Price at\nthe National Laboratory of Psychical Research, for Dr WilHam\nBrown (a member of the S.P.R. Council), for the International\nInstitute for Psychical Research, and for this Society.\nc 43\n\f44 K. M. Ooldney [part\nI might, perhaps, particularly mention the interest aroused some\nyears ago as a result of Mrs Garrett's trance utterance concerning\nthe loss of the airship RlOl. Its destruction was predicted, she tells\nme, in trance communications purporting to come from the well-\nknown airman Hinchhfife, who lost his life in an attempted east-to-\nwest crossing of the Atlantic. These communications have been\ndescribed in a book entitled The Return of Hinchliffe, pubhshed by\nthe Psychic Press. Forty-eight hours after the news was first\npublished of the loss of the RlOl in 1930, its commander, Lieut.\nIrwin, purported to communicate through Mrs Garrett at a sitting\nbeing held by Mr Harry Price. This has been described by Mr\nPrice in his book Leaves from a Psychist's Case-book (London, 1933).\nThe description given of the disaster seemed to be beyond the know-\nledge of the man in the street. Mr Price therefore got into touch\nwith the airship base at Gardington, Bedfordshire ; and I can myself\ntestify that an official from Gardington, who subsequently visited\nMr Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, was\ndefinitely of opinion that the trance utterance contained informa-\ntion not only beyond the knowledge of the man in the street, but\nknown only to a small group at Gardington, of which the purporting\ncommunicator was one. So far as this individual testimony is con-\ncerned, therefore, a prima facie case for paranormal knowledge\nappears to have been made out, which might repay further investiga-\ntion.\nBut Mrs Garrett's activities have not been confined to this side\nof the Atlantic. She is now on her fourth visit to the United States,\nand during these visits she has worked for the American Society for\nPsychical Research ; the Boston Society for Psychic Research ;\nwith Dr Rhine and Mr J. G. Pratt at Duke University ; with Mr\nHereward Garrington ; and with various American doctors.\nWhen Mrs Garrett returned to England in 1937, Mr Soal and I\ndetermined to ask her to repeat the various experiments carried\nout in America about which so much has been heard over here\nduring the last couple of years.\nIt should be noted that these experiments fall into two distinct\ncategories : those about which a Report has been pubhshed, and\nthose of which we have heard only verbally and by rumour.\nIn the former category come the experiments in Extra-Sensory-\nPerception carried out at Duke University and reported upon by\nDr Rhine, and two series of Proxy Sittings reported upon by Mr\nJ. G. Pratt.\nIn the latter category\u2014experiments about which no Report has\nbeen published but about which much has been heard verbally\u2014\n\f154] A Series of Experiments with Mrs Eileen Garrett 45\ncome the experiments undertaken in doctors' laboratories in\nAmerica, relating to physiological changes alleged to take place\nduring trance.\nMr Soal repeated the experiments in E.S.P., and I carried out a\nshort series of Proxy Sittings and a triple repetition of the doctors'\nphysiological tests.\nBefore we report on these in detail, we wish to place on record\nour very great appreciation\u2014an appreciation which must be shared\nby all students of the subject\u2014of the attitude maintained by Mrs\nGarrett. She has throughout given us her services entirely volun-\ntarily, and has grudged neither time nor work. Moreover, she\nfaces with courage the possibiUty that these searching tests' may\nprove disappointing to the hopes and possibilities of medium-\nship, but never fails to appreciate that it is by such exhaustive\ntests alone that we can hope to progress in our knowledge of the\nsubject.\nWe had hoped to give a detailed Report on all the work carried\nout, but time does not permit of this and I am unable on this occa-\nsion to report on the Proxy Sittings experiment. I will only men-\ntion here that 8 Proxy Sittings were held, with specially selected\nsitters ;\nthat all 8 scripts, bearing no name or distinguishing mark,\nwere sent to each of the sitters ; and that only one sitter succeeded\nin selecting what was, in fact, his own script. In doing so he\ncommented that he \" would have classified the result as '\nPoor\n'\nhad it been a normal (sitter-present) sitting \" and that \" at best\nthere were only streaks of relatively good hits \". The outcome\ncannot, therefore, be considered successful ; but it had interest-\ning repercussions which I shall hope to report upon on another\noccasion.\nThe experiments in E.S.P. and the result of the enquiry into\nalleged paranormal physiological conditions during trance, were\nENTIRELY NEGATIVE ; and I suggest that the onus now lies on the\nAmerican investigators who have claimed positive paranormal\nresults to show why such results are obtained in one hemisphere\nand not in another.\nWith this as a foreword, I will now proceed to give my Report on\nthe doctors' examination into physiological conditions obtaining\nduring the trance state. These experiments were carried out unde?\nthe auspices of the International Institute for Psychical Research,\nand I am indebted to the Council of that Society for permission to\nreport here on the result ; but I was myself entirely responsible for\narranging the experiments, and was present myself throughout to\ntake down shorthand notes.\n\f46 K.

It would be difficult to exaggerate the wild and\u2014as it\nhas proved\u2014unwarranted statements that have appeared in the\n\" Psychic Press \" in this country. \" In America \", we are given to\nunderstand, it has been \" scientifically proved \" in doctors' labora-\ntories that mediumistic Controls are entirely separate entities from\nthe medium through whom they operate. I will quote a few extracts\nfrom Journals devoted to this subject.\nThe Editorial Notes of the July 1937 issue of Psychic Science (the\nquarterly transactions of the British College of Psychic Science)\nspeak of \" the researches, psychological and clinical, made with\nthose Controls in the U.S.A. laboratories, when to aU tests their\nreactions were very different from those of the normal Eileen\nGarrett. These secondary personahties are able apparently to pro-\nduce such a powerful dramatic effort as can completely change the\nmetabohsm of the bodily functions.\"\nAt the Twelfth Annual Dinner of the British Society of Psychic\nScience, held at the Cafe Royal on May 5th, 1937, the Chairman\nagain told hsteners that \" it was found that the metabolism of the\nbody changed completely under particular '\nControls '\n; that was\nsomething that had never been demonstrated practically in the\nhistory of the world before. Those of us who are psychic students\nknow it, but we have not been able to put it down in black and\nwhite as these doctors could.\"\nThe July 30th, 1936, issue of Light speaks of the experiments\ndone in America as foUows :\n\" Not once did these exhaustive\nexperiments prove anything but that each of these three personahties\nyielded entirely divergent reactions to every '\ntest ' apphed.\" \" For\nsix months this year this intrepid medium has allowed herself for an\naverage of six hours a day to be put . . . through a long series of\nmedical tests.\" \" Proofs of the separate identity of these three\n\f48 K. M. Goldney [part\npersonalities came forth so clearly and undeniably one after the\nother, that at one point Dr Traeger of New York, who was con-\nducting the experiments, exclaimed, at the realisation of the implica-\ntions involved, '\nI hardly dare to go further '.\"\n\" Cardiographs obtained in the tliree states showed clearly the\nsomewhat delicate heart action of Eileen Garrett, the vigorous beat\nof Uvani, and the unmistakably feeble action of the aged Abdul.\"\n\" The blood counts varied correspondingly : the very constituents\nof the blood were not the same : where Mrs Garrett showed only\nabout 70 components of haemoglobin, Uvani registered approxi-\nmately 85, and Abdul as high as 110 ; their blood chemistry was\ncompletely different.\"\n\" Similarly with bleeding-time, coagulation times, respiration :\nnone of them were left untried, and not one of them failed to\nregister difference of personality.\"\nIn May 1937 Mrs Garrett was invited by the London Spiritualist\nAlliance to address the members of that Society. The following is\nan extract from Light of May 20th, 1937, on what she is reported\nto have said as to the American experiments :\n\" We worked for\nnine months and found enormous and alarming changes. The\ncardiographs were entirely different, the activity of the heart under\nthe Controls changed : one Control has no relationship to the other,\nand my cardiograph would have no more relation to their record-\nings than mine would, perhaps, to Dr Dingwall's.\" \" The blood\nchemistry of the alleged Control, Abdul Latif, contained the blood\nof a man in the last stages of diabetes ; the blood corpuscle of the\nUvani personahty was very much lower than my own. These were\nquite alarming.\"\nNow I am not necessarily suggesting that Mrs Garrett gave her\nlisteners incorrect information ; but I do suggest that it is very easy\nfor a layman dealing with a technical subject imperfectly under-\nstood\u2014or understood not at all\u2014to misinterpret facts, and draw\nconclusions unwarranted by those facts ; and I do suggest that\nSocieties incur a grave responsibihty when they invite other than\ntechnical experts to address their members on so technical a matter\nwithout laying very great stress on the warning that judgment should\nwait upon the publication of a first-hand and authoritative Report ; and\nthat Journals incur a similar responsibility when they give publicity\nto stupendous claims arising out of hearsay evidence.\nAn article I have just been reading in The Listener comments upon\nhow easy it is to be impressed by technical jargon we do not under-\nstand, and that the very fact that we do not understand it seems to\nbe in its favour. When, therefore, a lay audience is told\u2014quite\n\f154] A Series of Experiments with Mrs Eileen Garrett 49\ncorrectly\u2014that two successive blood counts taken at short intervals\nfrom the medium showed a difference in the red blood cell count of\ntwo hundred thousand, their amazed eyebrows rise hardly less high\nthan were they to hear of the miracle of the loaves and fishes being\nrepeated in their midst. Yet to the medical expert the increase\nindicates nothing abnormal, still less para-normal.\nAll that I had heard concerning the experiments carried out by\nAmerican doctors made me determine to get, if possible, first-hand\ninformation regarding these experiments and, further, to get these\ntests repeated in London. Mrs Garrett was more than ready, as\never, to co-operate. I aimed at obtaining the help of specialists\nwhose standing would lend to their opinions the highest authority.\nThrough Dr Helena Wright I was fortunate enough to obtain for\nthe blood-count experiments the co-operation of Dr Cuthbert\nDukes, O.B.E., M.Sc, M.D., D.P.H., etc. ; and for the electro-\ncardiographic experiments, the co-operation of Dr. Geoffrey Bourne,\nM.D., F.R.C.P., etc.\nThe experiments were carried out in the consulting rooms of these\ndoctors with Dr Helena Wright assisting. Dr Nandor Fodor, the\nDirector of the International Institute for Psychical Research, was\nalso present at the experiments. I was present to take down short-\nhand notes dictated to me by the doctors, and my notes and trans-\ncriptions were sent to them for their approval.\nIn no instance was there anything to suggest para-normality in\nthe results of any of the tests made ; in no instance was there any\ncorroboration of the claims I have quoted concerning physiological\nchanges during the trance state.\nIn addition, with the exception of the electro-cardiographic\ntracings, these experiments were repeated by Dr WiUiam Nunan,\nM.D., and Dr V. J. Woolley, M.D. (former Hon. Research Officer of\nthe Society for Psychical Research), both members of the Medical\nCommittee of the International Institute for Psychical Research.\nTheir finding agreed with those of Dr Dukes in being entirely\nnegative from the point of view of para-normality.\nI have already mentioned that there existed no published Report\non previous experiments to which I could refer, and my determina-\ntion to obtain if possible first-hand information. Mrs Garrett pro-\nvided me with tables of figures, which she said were the results of\nthe American experiments, undertaken by Dr. Traeger in New\nYork. I made copies which I then sent back to Dr Traeger, asking\nfor corroboration and for advice regarding the conduct of further\nexperiments. Further figures, charts and diagrams were sent me\nby Dr Traeger, and I ajn indebted to him for very ready co-opera-\n\f50 K. M. Goldney [part\ntion. These charts and figures were, however, accompanied by a\nwarning from Dr Traeger that the work already done had been\ninteresting but merely tentative, and that no conclusion was\nclaimed. I was told that copies of the Journals I have quoted had\ncaused perturbation by \" their attempt to journahze and even\nsensationahze the results of these rather tentative experiments\n\"\nand \" by their attempt to lend them an aura of accuracy and\nfinality which they do not possess \" ; and it is at Dr Traeger's own\nrequest that I here clarify his position.\nAll the American figures were confidentially submitted to the\nLondon doctors who undertook to repeat the experiments.\nThe Tables attached to this Report give in detail the results\nobtained in the London experiments from the various tests made :\n(a) Before trance.\n(6) During trance : Uvani in control.\n(c) During trance : Abdul Latif in control.\n{d) After trance.\nI will here touch upon these results only in summary, and give\nthe final opinion of our doctors on the results of their own tests,\nand their comments upon the American figures which I submitted\nto them.\nThese opinions should be contrasted with the false conclusions of\nthe Psychic Press already quoted.\nElectro-cardiographic tests.\nCommenting upon the electro-cardiographic tracings from\nAmerica submitted to him, Dr Geoffrey Bourne writes as follows :\n\" On examining this set of tracings, there is a similar uniformity\nwith one exception, that of the tracing described as Trance No. 2,\ndate Oct. 18th, 1935. Here there is a change in the R-S complex\nin Lead 3 ; but in my opinion this change is within the Hmits of\nwhat might be produced by some overdistension of the stomach,\nor variation in the position of the diaphragm.^ Such changes in\nLead 3 are common.\"\nRegarding the electro-cardiographic tracings he himself took,\nDr Bourne comments as follows :\n\" I took electro-cardiographic tracings of Mrs Garrett before her\ntwo trances, duLring each of them, and afterwards. The prints are\nenclosed. I can find no significant change in any of these tracings,\nwhich obviously come from the same individual.\"\n^ Note. This latter could be controlled.\u2014K.M.G. \u2022 i \u2022\n\f154] A Series of Experiments with Mrs Eileen Garrett 51\nBasal Metabolic Charts.\nCommenting upon the basal metabolic charts from America sub-\nmitted to him, Dr V. J. Woolley writes me as follows :\n\" AU that these charts show is that when the subject made violent\ninspiratory gasping efforts she consumed more oxygen than when\nshe was lying quietly at rest. This is not surprising : in fact it\nwould have been surprising if any other result had been obtained.\nIn all Basal Metabohc Rate determinations, the first essential is for\nthe subject to remain quietly at rest throughout. All these charts\nshow is how not to do it.\"\nBlood Chemistry.\nCommenting upon the American figures submitted to him, Dr\nDukes writes as follows :\n\" The figures for these tests are such as one would expect if the\nsame tests were carried out on normal people. The blood sugar\nvaries in healthy persons between 100-180 milhgrammes, and may\nchange 10 or 20 per cent, in the course of a few minutes. The urea\nnitrogen also fluctuates throughout the day, so that the variations\nrecorded for this individual are such as would be found under\nnormal circumstances.\"\nNote. In view of the fact that nothing paranormal was found\nwhen considering the more important claims, other tests in blood\nchemistry, changes due to injection of drugs, etc., were not con-\nsidered worth while repeating.\nHaemoglobin.\nCommenting upon the American figures submitted to him, Dr\nDukes writes as follows :\n\" I regard the variation in the haemoglobin recorded for this lady\nsuch as one would expect when repeated tests are carried out at\nshort intervals. There is perhaps an exception in the figures you\nhave underlined on page 4, and I admit that this is difficult to\naccoimt for. However, since all the other figures are so much\nwithin the Umits of what might be expected under normal circum-\nstances, I should not draw any conclusions from this isolated\nobservation without knowing more about the conditions under\nwhich they took place.\"\nRegarding his own tests, Dr Dukes writes :\n\" I estimated the haemoglobin by both the SahU and Haldane\nmethods.\"\n\f52 K. M. Goldney [part\nDr Dukes found nothing unusual in the results of the tests he\nmade.\nRed Blood Cells Count.\nCommenting upon the American figures submitted to him, Dr\nDukes writes :\n\" It must be admitted in the first place that the degree of accuracy\nwith which blood counts can be carried out does not extend beyond\nthe first 100,000. In fact, unless very special precautions are under-\ntaken, and the person carrying out the test is working under the\nmost perfect conditions, I should think that one might expect\nvariations of \\ million in 2 counts carried out at short intervals.\nThis does not mean that the blood actually changes, but these are\nthe Hmits of accuracy of the method employed. Unless special care\nis taken in the graduations of the pipettes and in the manner of\ncollection of the blood, I should say that even wider variations\nmight be expected in normal people. This being so, I find that most\nof the blood counts are definitely within normal limits. There are\ntwo recorded which are shghtly high, and then there is this peculiar\ncount on page 4-.^ Apart from this I do not think that these blood\ncounts show any evidence of any change taking place in the blood\nduring trance.\"\nDr Dukes also drew attention to the fact that in the American\nfigures numbers are given down to too small a figure\u2014one count,\nfor example, is quoted as 4 milhon and 50 thousand ; another as\n3 million and 10 thousand ;\nwhereas, as Dr Dukes pointed out in\nthe quotation I have already given, the degree of accuracy with\nwhich blood counts can be carried out does not extend beyond the\nfirst 100,000. A quotation of 50,000, still more of 10,000, would\ntherefore be meaningless.\nKegarding his own tests for red blood cells, Dr Dukes writes :\n\" My general conclusion is that there is no variation in the blood\ncount in these different states. Such minor changes as are shown\nin these recorded figures are within the limits of the accuracy of\nthe methods employed. ... I should be grateful if you would\nthank the subject of our experiments for her willing co-operation.\"\nSummarising what he felt on considering the American figures as\na ivJiole, Dr Dukes writes :\n\" My general opinion about the whole question is this : I should\nsay that these chemical and microscopical tests are such as one\n^ About which comment had akeady been made when deaUng with the\nhaemoglobin, q.v. p. 51.\n\f154] A Series of ExjJeriments with Mrs Eileen Garrett 53\nmight expect to find by repeated tests carried out on the same\nperson. No conclusion can be drawn from the tests that any\nunusual change takes place in the blood during the period of trance.\n. . . My own feeling is that the matter is not worth looking into\nany further along these hues.\"\nA word as to the variations shown in the London experiments in :\nThe pulse rate.\n. The plantar reflex.\nEye reflexes.\nPulse Rate.\nThis showed considerable change, which might appear surprising\nto those unfamiliar with pulse variations. Dr Nunan wrote me :\n\" A variation of 10-30 could be caused by a cough\u2014a laiigh\n\u2014\nthe IDEA of being examined, etc., etc. I have myself suggested\nvariations from 60 to 120 in a patient '\nput to sleep '\nby suggestion.\nBreathing rapidly will increase pulse rate naturally (i.e. for physio-\nlogical reasons).\"\nExperiments which I carried out with a couple of friends showed\nvariations in ourselves of 10 in successive counts due merely to\ndifference of posture ; a difference of 15 was effected by puffing\ntwice at a cigarette.\nPlantar Reflexes.\nThere was an absence of plantar response during trance.\nDr Woolley considers that plantar anaesthesia would be common\nin hysterics or during a state of fight auto-hypnosis.\nEye Reflexes.\nPerhaps the most spectacular of the trance conditions was the\nability shown by the control Abdul to hold the medium's eyes open\nwithout blinking for a prolonged period, notwithstanding a torch\nbeing flashed into them. At the tests carried out in Dr Bourne's\nconsulting room, this state was maintained without blinking for\n7 minutes, and released then only upon instruction by Dr Wright.\nUpon this result Dr Nunan comments :\n\" Very many normal people can stare imblinkingly, even at a\nbright object, for indefinite periods. Hysteria or hypnosis would\nproduce similar results.\"\nDr. Bourne summarises his comments on these tests as follows :\n\" The other sensory changes noted (conjunctival and plantar) are\n\f64 K. M. Goldriey [part\nto my mind similar to what is found in cases of functional sensory\nchange, i.e. functional anaesthesia.\"\nIt is disappointing to have to issue a negative report to any\ninvestigation. The extensive setting forth of purely negative results\nin this instance is necessitated by the publicity given by the Psychic\nPress to unjustified conclusions regarding the trance state, upon\nwhich I commented at the beginning of this report. Truly the\ngreatest enemies of matters psychical are its own devotees. It is\nnot, I feel, too strong a comment to make that not only do such\nexaggerated statements bring the whole subject into disrepute\namongst careful and serious enquirers, but that these travellers'\ntales, so Hghtly disseminated, are largely responsible for the fraud\nso extensively practised in our midst to-day which feeds upon public\nignorance and readiness to accept as established facts phenomena\nwhich should be regarded merely as experimental hypotheses.\nAPPENDIX 1\nCopy of letter from Dr Cuthbert Dukes commentmg upon the American\nfigures submitted confidentially to him for his consideration.\nNo. 1 Queen Anne Steeet,\nCavendish Squaee, W. 1,\n20th May, 1937.\nDear Mrs Goldney,\nMany thanks for your letter giving the results of the tests\non Mrs Eileen Garrett. I have read these through carefully and\nmay perhaps be able to help you if I tell you what sort of impression\nthey make upon me.\nWith regard to the blood chemistry (page 5). The figures for\nthese tests are such as one would expect if the same tests were\ncarried out on normal people. The blood sugar varies in healthy\npersons between 100-180 mg., and may change 10 or 20 per cent,\nin the course of a few minutes. The urea nitrogen also fluctuates\nthroughout the day, so that the variations recorded for this indi-\nvidual are such as would be found under normal circumstances.\nRegarding the haemoglobin figures, I should like to point out that\nthere is always an error of at least 2 or 3 per cent, in estimating\nthe haemoglobin even when carried out with the greatest care,\nusing the same pipettes and standards. Unless these precautions\nare taken, the error might be even greater. I regard the variation\nin the haemoglobin recorded for this lady as such as one would\nexpect when repeated tests are carried out at short intervals. There\n\f154] A Series of Experiments with Mrs Eileen Garrett 55\nis perhaps an exception in the figures you have underHned on page 4,\nand I admit that this is difficult to account for. However, since all\nthe other figures are so much within the hmits of what might be\nexpected under normal circumstances, I should not draw any con-\nclusions from this isolated observation without knowing more about\nthe conditions under which they took place.\nI feel much the same about the figiires for the Red Blood Cells.\nIt must be admitted in the first place that the degree of accuracy\nwith which blood counts can be carried out do not extend beyond\nthe first 100,000. In fact, unless very special precautions are taken,\nand the person carrying out the test is working under the most\nperfect conditions, I should think that one might expect variations\nof \\ million in 2 counts carried out at short intervals. This does\nnot mean that the blood actually changes, but these are the Umits\nof accuracy of the method employed. Unless special care is taken\nin the graduations of the pipettes and in the manner of collection\nof the blood, I should say that even wider variations might be\nexpected in normal people.\nThis being so, I find that most of the blood counts are definitely\nwithin normal Umits. There are two recorded on pages 1 and 5\nwhich are shghtly high, and then there Is this pecuhar count on\npage 4. Apart from this I do not think that these blood counts\nshow any evidence of any change taking place in the blood during\ntrance. Personally I should interpret these chemical and micro-\nscopical tests in the opposite sense and say that in so far as they go\nthey rather lead to the conclusion that the condition of the blood\nis as constant as might be expected under normal circumstances.\nIn saying this I must, of course, make an exception of the count\nrecorded on page 4 after the injections of strychnine ; but as I say,\none would have to have a great deal more information about this\nbefore drawing conclusions from it.\nMy general opinion about the whole question is this\u2014I should\nsay that these chemical and microscopical tests are such as one\nmight expect to find by repeated tests carried out on the same\nperson. No conclusion can be drawn from the tests that any un-\nusual change takes place in the blood during the period of trance.\n. . . My own feehng is that the matter is not worth looking into\nany further along these fines.\nYours sincerely,\n(Signed) Cuthbert Dukes.\n(Note. In spite of his opinion that the matter was not worth\nlooking into any further along these fines, Dr Dukes very kindly\nconsented to repeat the tests. \u2014K.M.G.)\n\f56 K. M.

I also estimated the haemo-\nglobin by both the Sahli and Haldane methods. The Sahli always\ngives a reading 20 per cent, lower than the Haldane, SahU's normal\nfigures for the haemoglobin being 80 per cent, and Haldane's 100\nper cent.\nMy general conclusion is that there is no variation in the blood\ncount in these different states. Such minor changes as are shown\nin these recorded figures are within the limits of the accuracy of\nthe methods employed. I finished the tests at 10 p.m. after having\nstarted my day's work at 8.30 a.m. and I should be more inclined\nto attribute any slight differences in the figures to myself rather\nthan to the subject of our experiments.\nI very much regret that owing to the pressure of other work I\nhad to make such an unceremonious exit and was unable to take\nany more personal interest in your side of the investigations. As\nyou know I had just received an urgent call and had to spend all\nmy spare minutes in packing my bag. That is why I was unable\nto join in your other observations.

Lond.\n\f154] A Series of Exj^erin'ients with Mrs Eileen Garrett 69\nPART II\nA REPETITION OF DR J. B. RHINE'S WORK WITH\nMRS EILEEN GARRETT\nBy S. G. Soal\nI. Introduction\nAlthough my investigation of Mrs Garrett is only a small part of\na much larger programme of research dealing with the work of Dr\nRhine, I have thought it worth while to pay special attention to\nMrs Garrett's work for two reasons.\nIn the first place Mrs Garrett is one of the very few professional\nmediums who have placed their services unreservedly at the dis-\nposal of the scientific investigator, and for this attitude alone she\nmerits very high praise. In the second place Mrs Garrett quite\ndefinitely ranks as one of the subjects for whom Dr Rhine makes\nvery remarkable claims. These claims Dr Rhine has given in con-\nsiderable detail in an article published in Character and Personality\n(Vol. Ill, No. 2, December 1934). According to this article Mrs\nGarrett obtained remarkably successful results in both telepathy\nand clairvoyance.\nThus in a clairvoyant series of 3525 guesses carried out in the\nnormal state, she wins -888 correct hits. This is a deviation from\nchance expectation of + 183, i.e. over 7 times the standard devia-\ntion. There can be no doubt that this result is highly significant,\nwhatever statistical procedure is adopted in evaluating it. Of this\nseries Dr Rhine remarks :\n\" Out of 3525 trials for clairvoyance in\nthe three days, 1550 were made with a distance of at least 15 feet\nand with at least one wall between the cards and the sensitive, and\nthese 62 runs of 25 yielded a higher average score than did the 1975\nmade with the cards on the table with the sensitive \" (6-5 per 25\nas against 6-1 per 25).\nIn another series of 625 trials at Pure Telepathy she scored 336\ncorrect hits, this being equivalent to an average of 13-4 correct hits\nper 25 guesses sustained over 25 packs of cards. The reader will be\nable to appreciate the remarkable significance of this result when\nI assure him that in a series of over 100,000 guesses (using a random\nsequence of cards) I have obtained only a single set of 25 with as\nmany as 13 guesses correct and no set with more than 13 correct,\na result which is in accordance with chance expectation.\nOf course, in the above 625 experiments of Dr Rhine presumably\n\f70 S. G. Soal [part\nthe experimenter constructed a mental series of card-images in lieu\nof using actual cards, and it would be an assumption under such\ncircumstances to take mean chance expectation as 5 successes per\n25 guesses. At the same time I fail to see how the average could\nreach the level of 134 unless both guesser and experimenter practi-\ncally confined themselves to the same pair of symbols, and one can\nhardly suppose that Dr Rhine could pass over without mention\nsuch a glaring absurdity as this. I can therefore find no normal\nmeans of accounting for Dr Rhine's success, and it would be super-\nfluous to quote more figures from his article. I will merely note\nthat although the experiments with the medium in the trance state\nwere few in comparison with those in which she was normal, there\nwas one series of 100 for telepathy in the trance state in which she\nscored no less than 44 correct hits.\nWhen, therefore, Mrs Garrett at the beginning of last May\nexpressed her willingness to try some experiments with Zener cards,\nI eagerly acquiesced. In order to create a friendly atmosphere it\nwas arranged that Mrs Garrett and I should meet at lunch at Mrs\nHenry Richard's house in company with a biologist and a medical\nman interested in her work. The first 375 guesses were done at\nMrs Richard's house after lunch with Mrs Goldney acting as agent,\nbut the remainder of the series were carried out in the Psychological\nLaboratory at University College, Gower Street. Full details of\nthe experiments will, I hope, appear in my forthcoming report on\nExtra-Sensory Perception, but as this may not be available for\nsome time I feel it is advisable to put on record now a fairly complete\naccount of the experiments and results obtained.\nMrs Garrett has now returned to America, and until she comes\nback there is no prospect of further experiments being carried out\nwith her in this country.\n2. General Remarks on the Experiments\nI have been assisted by eleven persons in the conduct of the\nexperiments. Five of these were advanced students in the depart-\nments of Psychology and Philosophy at University College. These\nwere Miss J. Stephens (J.S.), Mr A. J. Marshall (A.J.M.), Mr A. J.\nBould (A.J.B.), Mr D. C. Russell (D.C.R.), and Miss M. Baldwin\n(M.B.). One of these (A.J.B.) showed me some remarkably signi-\nficant results which he had obtained at home with his brother acting\nas agent. The two brothers told me that they sat in different corners\nof the room, but were not screened from each other. The younger\nbrother (H.G.B.) thought of a sequence of Zener card images to be\n\f154] A Series of Experiments with Mrs Eileen Garrett 71\nguessed by A.J.B., but no actual cards were used. A.J.B. told me\nthat during the experiment lie did not look at liis brother.\nIn these experiments neither of the sequences would be random\nsequences, and it would be hazardous to assume that the mean\nchance expectation for 25 guesses was 5. The two brothers came\nto University College and carried out telepathic experiments in\nwhich a random sequence of actual Zener cards was employed, a\nscreen being interposed between the two brothers. At certain of\nthese experiments I was present as a witness, but at others I was\nnot. None of the results obtained were significantly above chance\nexpectation. On one occasion (in my absence) the brothers reverted\nto their former method, except that they used a screen, but again\nthe results were without significance, although there was some\ninteresting light thrown by one short sequence on the possibihty of\nsimilar number or sequence habits being evoked by an external\nstimulus.\nOf the remaining six persons. Miss E. Siderapoula (E.S.) is the\nSecretary of the Philosophical Department at University College.\nShe is keenly interested in clairvoyance and has assisted me on\nmany occasions. One day she took home with her a few packs\nof my Zener cards to experiment with alone, and obtained what\nappeared to be remarkable results. These results, however, could\nnot subsequently be confirmed in my presence in the laboratory.\nI pointed out to E.S. that the three packs she took home contained\neach an unusually large number of the same particular symbol. As\nE.S. would become aware of this after doing a few sets of 25, no\ngreat importance could be attached to the high scores obtained.\nE.S. has by training now become a very competent experimenter,\nand under good conditions does not exhibit any faculty of clair-\nvoyance (that is in my presence).\nMr H. J. Heckle (H.J.H.), Mrs M. Johnstone (M.J.) and Miss\nRita Elliott (R.E.), who took charge of the experiments in Series\n(ii) (Table B), have assisted me for periods varying from one to\nthree years, and I feel that now I can trust them to carry out my\nvarious techniques without deviating from the prescribed routine.\nThe experiments fall naturally into two distinct series, which I\nshall call Series (i) and Series (ii). In Series (i), which was carried\nout between 8th May and 24th June of last year, I was present\ninside the room on every occasion and manipulated the cards, there\nbeing also present Mrs Garrett and the agent or witness.\nIn the second series, carried out between 30th August and 30th\nSeptember, I arranged for the agent to be alone with Mrs Garrett\nwhile I remained in an adjoining room. In this latter series the\n\f72 S. G. Soal [part\nexperimenters were, with one exception (Mrs Naumberg, an Ameri-\ncan visitor), chosen from my trained helpers, and I exhorted them\nto do all in their power to give the medium encouragement of a\nverbal kind and praise for successes, etc.\nIt is often urged by the more emotional devotees of the super-\nnormal that when a medium fails under test conditions to obtain\nhis or her accustomed phenomena the failure is not due to the\nexceptional care and good technique of the new experimenter, but\nto the fact of his critical or sceptical mentality inhibiting the free\nplay of the psychic's powers. It is doubtless true that many\nfraudulent mediums have tried to explain away their failures under\nthe cover afforded by this hypothesis. Nevertheless there may be\nan element of truth in the hypothesis itself, though I doubt if it is\nwholly true. It is maintained by Dr Rhine and others that the\nsecret of success with these Zener cards lies in the power of the\nexperimenter to suggest the idea of success to his subject. Now\nthe most suggestible state we know is the hypnotic state, and I\nhave experimented extensively with at least two hypnotic subjects.\nI was able to put these subjects to sleep, to induce in them visual\nand auditory hallucinations, complete insensitiveness to pain as\ntested by deep pricking with a sterilised hat-pin, and the successful\nperformance of post-hypnotic suggestions. When I suggested that\nthe subject should see what was on the face of a Zener card he saw\nand described one of the five symbols at once, but statistical tests\nshowed that what he saw by suggestion had no relation to the\nsymbol on the actual card itself. Of these experiments with the\nhypnotised subject, Mr Ryecardt, 500 were tests in Pure Clair-\nvoyance with 105 correct hits, and 350 were (U.T.) experiments\nwith 63 correct hits. In neither case were the results significant.\nIt does not seem to be true, therefore, that mere power to suggest\nsuccess can be the real secret. On the other hand I have had at\nleast one subject (a well-known art photographer) who possessed\nxmliraited confidence in his power to guess the symbols on cards.\nHe came to No. 14d Roland Gardens, saying that he had not come\nto be tested, but to \" demonstrate \" to us the reality of telepathy.\nHe told us that he had often read a whole pack of cards through\ncorrectly from top to bottom. We tested him, using a screen, but\nto his own disappointment and amazement he failed completely.\nHe then told us that he had usually done this kind of thing in the\nevening after having imbibed a certain quantity of alcohol. He\ninvited me and a friend to his studio one evening, and after a suit-\nable libation he tried the telepathic tests, but again failed absolutely\nto beat the laws of chance.\n\f154] A Series of Experiments with Mrs Eileen Garrett 73\nIn order therefore to eliminate any disturbing effects on Mrs\nGarrett due to my mentality, which I admit is somewhat sceptical,\nI took the precaution of carrying out Series (ii) in which I should\nbe absent from the room. If it is retorted that when I was not in\nthe room I still exerted a telepathically inhibiting effect on Mrs\nGarrett, then I am afraid I have no answer. At the commence-\nment of the experiments Mrs Garrett told me that she would prefer\nnot to know the exact number of correct hits she obtained on each\noccasion. However, I thought it advisable to inform her when she\nscored an eight or a nine ; and when she obtained a six or a seven\nI said usually, \" That's splendid, you're doing fine,\" etc.\n3. Summary of Techniques employed\nWe have made experiments in both Pure Clairvoyance and Un-\ndifferentiated Extra-Sensory Perception, with the medium in the\nnormal state and also in the alleged trance.\nI must explain at the outset that three persons are concerned in\nthe experiments of Series (i). In clairvoyance experiments these are\nthe experimenter (S.G.S.), the witness and the subject or guesser\n(Mrs Garrett or her trance personahty). The experimenter is the\nperson who deals out the cards and keeps the record, while the duty\nof the witness is to check the number of guesses reported correct by\nthe experimenter. The witness also signs the record sheet, and thus\ntestifies that he is in agreement with the entries made by the\nexperimenter.\nIn the telepathy experiments the experimenter (S.G.S.) again\ndeals out the cards to be guessed, and generally supervises the\nwork ; but in this case the witness or agent, as he is now called, has\nduties in addition to those of checking and witnessing. He is the\nperson who looks at the card while I hold it close to the screen, and\ntries to transmit its image to the guesser, Mrs Garrett, who sits\nbehind the screen. This second person is therefore called the\nwitness in clairvoyance experiments and the agent in telepathy\nexperiments.\nIn Series (ii) (Table B) only two persons were present : the sub-\nject, Mrs Garrett, and the agent, who was now also the experimenter.\nWithout exception the Pure Clairvoyance work was done by\nmeans of a \" screened \" matching technique. In these experiments\ndenoted by (P.C.M.) (normal) or (\nP. CM.)\n^ (Trance) the medium\nsat behind a black metal screen measuring 2 feet broad by 1 foot\n^ In what follows underlined techniques such as P.C.M. or U.T. signify\nthat the medium was in the alleged trance.\n\f74 S. 0. Soal [part\n6 inches high, which stood on the table. Between the bottom edge\nof the screen and the table was a gap |\" high, through which the\nmedium could push a hght metal pointer. The screen stood over\nthe centre line of a row of five \" target \" cards bearing in order the\nsymbols +, 0, Star, Rectangle, Wave, and fixed faces upwards to\nthe table by means of drawing pins. Between each pair of cards\nwas a gap of about j\". The experimenter sat facing the screen,\nand with his left elbow resting on the table held the pack of 25\ncards in his left hand close to the centre of the screen, the backs of\nall the cards being towards him. At the signal \" Next \" the medium\nhad to guess the bottom card of the pack (i.e. the card nearest the\nscreen) by pointing with the rod at the corresponding \" target\ncard \". The experimenter then lifted off the bottom card, and\nwithout looking at its face placed it carefully opposite the target\ncard chosen by the medium. At the end of 25 guesses the 25 cards\nthus found themselves arranged in five piles, all the cards being face\ndownwards. To prevent confusion by mixing, the five piles were\nplanted at considerably wider intervals than were the \" target\n\"\ncards, but in the same order as the latter.\nA count was then made of the successes under each symbol, and\nthese were recorded on the scoring sheet by the experimenter thus :\nThe count was carefully checked by the witness.^ If the score\nobtained by the medium was 6 or more, she was told, \" You are\ndoing splendidly! \" etc., and when the score was 8 or more I usually\ntold her the exact number. When the score was 5 or below 5, I\npassed to the next pack without comment.\nDuring the trance state the medium sat with her chin supported\non her left forearm. Her eyes were at first closed, but I managed\nto induce \" Uvani \" to open them, and in this state he was able to\nmanipulate the pointer quite satisfactorily with his right hand in\nboth the (\nU.T.M. ) and the (P.C.M.) experiments.\nI performed a considerable number of experiments in \" Undif-\nferentiated Extra-Sensory Perception \" by the use of a \" screened\n\"\nmatching technique, since both Dr Pratt and Mr Tyrrell lay con-\nsiderable stress on the importance of what we might term \" auto-\n5\n{ +\n0\ns\nR\n1\n0\n2\n1\n1\niw\n' The distance between subject and experimenter was about 3 feet 6 inches.\n\f154] A Series of Experimeyits with Mrs Eileen Garrett 75\nmatic \" methods of guessing. This technique denoted by (U.T.M.)\n(Normal) or (U.T.M.) (Trance) is not a very rigorous one. Never-\ntheless I thought it would be interesting to see if Mrs Garrett would\nobtain any apparent success by its use. If any significant results\nhad appeared I should, of course, have made a careful investigation\nof its normal possibihties.\nThe chief danger lies in the possibility that the agent or experi-\nmenter watching the motion of the pointer along the row of cards\nmay make some involuntary audible movement that will cause the\nmedium to stop the pointer at the correct card, which, of course, is\nknown to both agent and experimenter. The objection does not\napply to the (P. CM.) technique. I have, therefore, in addition,\ndone a series of telepathy experiments using my ordinary more\nrigorous (U.T.) technique.\nIn the (U.T.M.) and (U.T.M.) series the experimenter sat at the\nside of the table close to the screen, and the agent faced the screen.\nAs before, the experimenter held the pack close to the centre of the\nscreen with the backs of the cards towards the agent's face. Having\nenquired if the medium was ready to begin, the experimenter closed\nhis eyes immediately before lifting off the top card of the pack for\nthe agent to visualise, and then with closed eyes called out \" First\nGuess \" or \" Next \", as the case might be. Immediately the card\nwas exposed the agent looked at it, and then formed a visual image\nin his mind or sometimes a verbal image of the name of the card.\nThe agent remained silent throughout. By this method the experi-\nmenter, who is ignorant of the card exposed when he signals \" Next\n\"\nto the medium, can give nothing away by the inflections of his\nvoice. Not until the medium's pointer had come quite definitely to\nrest on some particular card did the experimenter place the exposed\ncard face downwards on the appropriate pile. The details of record-\ning and checking are the same as in the (P.C.M.) experiments.\nIn the ordinary (U.T.) (Normal) and (U.T.) (Trance) experiments\nthe subject was hidden both from experimenter and agent by a\nlight wooden screen, measuring 3' 0\" by 3' 0\", which rested across\nthe centre of the table, there being no gap between screen and table.\nA vertical board fixed underneath the table and used in both (U.T,)\nand (U.T.M.) experiments prevented the subject from getting a\nglimpse of the agent's legs or feet, or from making any contact\nwith them beneath the table. As explained in the (U.T.M.) tech-\nnique, the experimenter was ignorant of the card exposed when\ngiving the signal \" Next \" to the medium. In the (U.T.) (Normal)\nexperiments the medium recorded her own guesses in pencil in the\nleft-hand column of a scoring sheet designed to hold two sets of\nE\n\f76 S. 0. Soal [part\n25 guesses. In the (U.T.) (Trance) experiments the control\n\" Uvani \" called out aloud the guess, which was recorded by the\nexperimenter on his own scoring sheet. In both (U.T.) and (U.T.)\nexperiments the experimenter recorded the actual card sequence by\nmeans of five rubber stamps of similar make and weight, the\n\" actual \" symbols being thus inscribed in the right-hand column\nof an identical scoring sheet. When the medium had recorded her\nguess she intimated the fact by giving two taps with her pencil on\nthe table.\nAt the end of 25 guesses the medium read aloud her colunm of\nguesses, still remaining on her side of the screen, while the experi-\nmenter copied the hst on his own scoring sheet. The process was\nthen repeated for the next 25 guesses, and when the 50 guesses\nwere completed, the medium, still retaining her seat behind the\nscreen, handed the sheet to the experiment\/er, who then copied his\nown \" actual \" card columns on to the medium's sheet. In this\nway the medium saw nothing of the actual card sequences which\nhad appeared.\nIn the (U.T.) (Trance) experiments only a single record sheet was\nkept, since it was felt that the control \" Uvani \" would find it im-\npossible to use a pencil while the medium was in the trance state.\nIn this case the control \" Uvani \" called aloud his guesses, which\nwere recorded by the experimenter. Both scoring sheets in (U.T.)\nwork were signed by both agent and experimenter before passing\non to the next set ojf 50 guesses.\nWhenever the technique employed admitted the making of a\nduplicate record sheet, this was posted by the agent to Dr C. E. M.\nJoad in an envelope sealed in my presence.\nAs regards the elimination of involuntary whispering by the\nagent or experimenter, no especial precautions were taken beyond\ninstructing the agent to keep his mouth tightly closed throughout\nthe work. Before the experiments commenced, the room was care-\nfully studied for the possibility of reflections, and the necessary\nadjustments made in this respect.\nIt should be added that all the agents and witnesses employed\nwere favourably disposed towards a behef in the reahty of telepathic\nphenomena. Two of them (K.M.G.) and (M.J.) had obtained what\nthey believed to be genuine supernormal results with trance\nmediums ; and another (E.S.) thought she had obtained remarkable\nresults when using a pack of Zener cards at home, which results,\nhowever, failed to materialise under more critical conditions.\nIn the tables which follow I have been unable to make any\nanalysis of \" runs \" of successes (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., consecutive\n\f154] A Series of Experiments ivith Mrs Eileen. Garrett 11\nsuccesses), since the Screened Matching methods do not readily\nallow of the experimenter keeping any account of such runs. For\nthe same reason it was not found possible to analyse the distribution\nof a smaller group than 25 guesses.\n4.

The values of represent the squares of the\ndeviations from mean expectation divided by the squares of the\ncorresponding standard deviations. If the value obtained for\nexceeds 4-0 this means that the deviation of the actual number of\ncorrect hits from the expected number is either in excess or deficit\nmore than twice what is called the \" Standard Deviation \". Now\nin a \" Normal \" distribution a deviation which is numerically\ngreater than twice the Standard Deviation occurs on the average\nabout once in 20 trials. Such a deviation is therefore sufficiently\nremarkable to excite our interest, and to suggest at least that some-\nthing more than chance may have been at work. The deviation is\nsaid to be \" significant \" if the odds against its being due to chance\nexceed 20 to 1. Thus, if I take a perfectly constructed cubical die\nwhose six faces are marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respectively, and shake it\ninside a box 240 times in succession, the expected number of times\nthe face \" 3 \" should turn up is 240 x i = 40.\nThis does not mean, of course, that \" 3 \" will turn up exactly\n40 times in 240 throws, for sometimes there will be more than 40\n\" threes \" and sometimes less. But if I did the experiment of throw-\ning the die 240 times again and again, the average of the numbers\nobtained would approximate to 40 in the long run. The chance\nthat a \" three \" will turn up at a single throw is clearly g, and\nhence the chance that it will not turn up is 1 - 1 = f\n.\nNow if, as in this ideal case, the chance is constant at each trial,\nthe number of \" threes \" which turn up will obey what is known as\nthe Binomial Distribution. Thus if I tossed 12 such perfect dice\nsimultaneously in 12 cups, the possible number of \" threes \" that\ncould appear would range from 0 to 12. And if I did the experiment\nof tossing the 12 dice 1000 times in succession, the number of cases\nin which I should get 0, 1, 2, ... 12 \" threes \" would approximate to\nthe successive terms of the Binomial expansion of 1000 x [f + ^]^^.\nThat is to say the expected number of cases in the 1000 trials in\nwhich 0 threes turned up would be 1000 x [fJ^^.\nThe expected number of cases with 1 \" three \"is\n1000xl2x[|]iix[i],\netc., while the expected number of cases with 12 \" threes \" would be\n1000x[i]i2.\nThe \" Standard Deviation \" of the Binomial Distribution is given\nby the formula Jtipll ~p), where n is the number of trials, and p\n\f80 iS. G. Soal [PABT\nis the chance of success at a single trial, this chance being supposed\nto remain constant during the series.\nThus in our first example of throwing a die 240 times in succession\nwe have w = 240, f^^.\nHence the Standard Deviation for 240 trials is V240 x ^ x | = 5-77.\nIf I tossed a single die 240 times in succession and counted more\nthan 52 \" threes \" or less than 28 \" threes \", I should have obtained\na deviation in either case from the average (40) of more than twice\nthe standard deviation. That is the odds against such a result\nbeing due to the fluctuations of chance would be nearly 20 to 1,\nand I should suspect that the die was not evenly balanced about its\ncentre. A solitary deviation of this magnitude would, of course,\nprove nothing, bixt would suggest that I shoiild repeat the experi-\nment of tossing the die 240 times to note if similar deviations were\nobtained. If I got a similar result the next time, I should go on\nmaking repetitions until I was satisfied that some factor beyond\nchance was in operation.\nIf, however, I did the experiment 60 times in succession and\nfound that in only three cases did the deviation numerically exceed\ntwice the standard deviation and in each case by no serious amount,\nand if in addition I found that the total deviation of the number of\n\"threes\" which turned up in the whole 60x240 = 14,400 trials\ndiffered from the chance expectation (2400) by less than twice the\nstandard deviation for n= 14,400 trials, I should have no reason to\nsuspect any other factor at work than the fluctuations produced\nnormally by chance.\nThe reader may apply the above to the case of Zener cards by\ntaking p = \\ instead of ^ and n the number of guesses. Thus the\nstandard deviation in 200 guesses with Zener cards is\ns\/200xix| = 5-65.\nIt should be pointed out, however, that the above formula for\nstandard deviation only strictly holds if the series of cards to be\nguessed is chosen in a \" random \" or haphazard order. This would\nbe the case if at each guess the card chosen by the experimenter\nwas determined by tossing a perfectly made^ve-sided die, each face\nof which was inscribed with one of the five symbols (assuming the\nconstruction of such a die to be feasible). The formula would not,\nfor instance, be strictly applicable to packs of 25 cards made up\naccording to Dr Rhine's plan with exactly 5 cards of each symbol\nper pack. For in this case the chance that a card turned up should\nbe (say) a circle fluctuates as we work through the pack. The first\nfive cards might happen to be all circles, and in that case the chance\n\f154] A Series of Experiments with Mrs Eileen Garrett 81\nof the sixth card being a circle is clearly zero and that for each of\nthe other four suits is j. Dr Rhine's series of cards do not therefore\nconstitute a random distribution, and a shght correction is required\nin the formula giving the standard deviation for n guesses.\nThe actual problem is, however, further comphcated by the fact\nthat a person guessing 25 cards in succession will not guess exactly\n5 of each symbol, even though he knows that the pack contains\nequal numbers of each suit. In the absence therefore of the know-\nledge of how the various guessers have distributed their guesses\nover the five symbols Dr Rhine's problem is strictly indeterminate,\nand even if we possessed this knowledge the exact solution would\nappear to be a rather formidable exercise in combinatory analysis.\nAlthough the ultimate corrections that have to be applied may\nbe only slight, I was fully alive to these difficulties when I com-\nmenced my experiments in 1934, and I decided to circumvent them\nif possible by using a random sequence of symbols. I had at my\ndisposal exactly 1200 cards, there being 240 of each symbol. From\nthese I made a random distribution of 1000 cards as follows.\nI first associated with each of the symbols -t- , 0, Star, Rectangle,\nWave the respective numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I then provided myself\nwith Chambers' Seven-figure Matheimtical Tables, and read from\nthem the last digits of the logarithms of the following numbers :\n10078, 10178, 10278, ... 99978.\nThe numbers chosen were thus taken at intervals of 100, so as to\nensure that the last digits in the logarithms should be independent.\nIf the digit happened to be one of the numbers 1 to 5 the digit was\nentered on the hst, or rather the corresponding symbol was written.\nIf the digit happened to be 0 or 6, 7, 8, 9 it was not entered. From\nthis sequence I thus obtained a random series of about 450 cards.\nThe process was then repeated with, say, the following numbers :\n10043, 10143, 10243, ... 99943,\nand so on, until a hst of 1000 cards had been compiled.\nThe actual cards were then chosen one by one, according to the\nabove list, from the 1200 cards in my possession.\nIn the end there were, of course, not exactly 200 cards of each\nsymbol, and up to January 1937 I made the mistake of adding or\nremoving a few cards in such a way as to disturb the distribution\nas Uttle as possible until I had exactly 200 of each symbol. After\nJanuary 1937 I made fresh random distributions, but without the\nabove adjustment, which is strictly illegitimate.\nAfter the random series of 1000 cards had been compiled I\n\f82 S. G. Soul [part\ndivided it into 40 consecutive blocks of 25, and placed the 40 sets\nof 25 in their original order into 40 envelopes numbered 1-40.\nThese envelopes were then placed in order in two cardboard boxes,\nrach containing 20 envelopes. Mrs Garrett began with pack No. 1\non 8th May, and worked through the 40 envelopes in order till she\nhad completed the first 1000 guesses. Strictly I should at this\npoint have worked out a fresh random distribution of the 1000\ncards, but the labour involved would have been prohibitive. Before\ncommencing the next 1000 guesses, therefore, I reshuffled all the\ncards in each of the 40 packs, and also reshuffled the 40 envelopes\nin the boxes.\nI then worked through the envelopes in the new order in which\nthey stood in the boxes. In this random distribution the numbers\nof the five symbols in the order + , 0, Star, Rectangle, Wave, were\nrespectively\n203, 198, 200, 202, 197.\nAfter series (i) (6425 guesses) had been completed, I went through\nthe labour of compiling a fresh random distribution from Chambers'\ntables, which was used for series (ii).\nThe numbers of the five symbols in this distribution were :\n194, 205, 206, 195, 200.\nReturning now after this digression to Tables (A) and (B), we see\nthat there are just two values of which exceed 4 (one in Table\n(A) and one in Table (B). Both these occur in small sets of 200\nguesses. Ignoring for simplicity the first 25 guesses we have in all\n12,400 guesses. Now if we take out these two sets of 200 with\nX^ = 4:-5 we are left with 60 consecutive groups of 200, and I find\nthat in this batch of 60 groups there is just one with a deviation\n(negative) with x^ = 4-0. This group of 200, however, is split\nbetween consecutive days and different agents. In 62 groups of\n200 we should expect about 3 groups with and we have seen\nthere are three such groups. Moreover, when in (J3) Mrs Garrett\nobtained ;^;- = 4-500, I was careful to make her do another 1000\nexperiments with the same agent (M.J.) on the following day. There\nis nothing abnormal about this group of 1000 guesses, and if it is\nspht up into 5 consecutive groups of 200 none of the values of\neven approach 4. I have split up all the other groups of 1000,\n600, 400, etc., given in Tables (A) and (B), and can find no group\nof 200 with x^>4 except the two which I have cited. A comparison\nof Tables (A) and (B) shows clearly that Mrs Garrett is no more\nsuccessful in my absence than when I am present in the room. My\n\f154] A Series of Experiments with Mrs Eileen Garrett 83\nexperiments with other subjects point in the same direction. None\nof my trained helpers when left alone with a subject appear to\nsucceed any better than myself. So far as my own observations are\nconcerned the personahty of the experimenter appears to have no\neffect on the results, even though some of my helpers might be\nclassed definitely as \" believers \". None of these helpers, however,\ncould be described as \" highly emotional \" or \" temperamental\n\"\npeople, though their mentalities are of a rather different type from\nmy own. If one employs hysterical or excitable persons as experi-\nmenters one will assuredly obtain positive results if one is not\npresent to watch them as a cat watches a mouse. But if, on the\nother hand, one does decide to watch such experimenters, one is\nimmediately told that one's \" personahty \" inhibits the results if\nthese results hapjjen to be negative.\nTable (D)\n(Totals for Telepathy Experiments)\nTechnique Guesses Hits Dev.

Soal [part\nTables (D) and (E) show that the medium succeeds on the whole\nwith neither telepathy nor clairvoyance. It is also seen that there\nis apparently no virtue in the \" screened matching \" or \" motor\n\"\nmethods advocated by Mr Tyrrell and Dr Pratt. Table (F) demon-\nstrates that the medium succeeds no better as \" Uvani \" than when\nshe is her normal self.\nAn analysis of the various groups of results has been made by\nsets of 25, but in a mere summary of results I shall content myself\nwith a single analysis of the 12,425 guesses.\nTable (G)\n(For 497 sets of 25)\nA E X X2\/E\n0, 1 20 13-613 + 6-387 2-99669\n2 25 35-207 -10-207 2-95915\n3 70 67-483 + 2-517 0-09388\n4 84 92-790 - 8-790 0-83268\n5 94 97-432 - 3-432 0-11472\n6 91 81-195 + 9-805 1-18404\n7 55 55-092 - 0-092 0-00154\n8 34 30-993 + 3-007 0-29174\n9 16 14-637 + 1-363 0-12692\n10, 11, etc. 8 8-607 - 0-607 0-04281\nTotals - 497 497-049 8-64417\nIn the above table column A gives the actual number of sets of\n25 guesses with (0, 1), 2, 3, etc., correct hits.

Adding up the values of X^^\/E we find\n;Y^\n= 8-64, which with n = 9 degrees of freedom gives P lying between\n0-45 and 0-50. It is seen, therefore, that using a random distribu-\ntion of 1000 cards to start with we do get excellent agreement with\nthe Binomial Distribution. There is no reason whatever to suppose\nthat Mrs Garrett obtains sevens, eights, nines, etc., more often than\nchance would predict.\n5. Conclusion\nIn the case of Mrs Eileen Garrett we fail to find the slightest con-\nfirmation of Dr J. B. Rhine's remarkable claims relating to her\n\f154] A Series of Experiments with Mrs Eileen Garrett 85\nalleged powers of extra-sensory perception. Not only did she fail\nwhen I took charge of the experiments, but she failed equally when\nfour other carefully trained experimenters took my place. None of\nthese four persons were of the \" academic \" type ;\nthey were persons\nin very diverse walks of Hfe. The one asset they had in common\nwas a long and meticulous training in the manipulation of cards ;\nthey had been carefully drilled in avoiding the different sources of\nerror, and they were not likely to originate any careless methods.\nThe writer first made the acquaintance of Mrs Garrett in the year\n1926, and in the autumn of that year had a series of sittings with\nher at which half a dozen persons on the staff of Queen Mary College\nwere introduced anonymously. Careful records made by myself\n(and in several cases by a shorthand notetaker) were annotated by\nthe sitters, who were all highly intelligent persons. Not a single\nsitter was impressed or gave a verdict favourable to the supernormal.\nThe more serious question will doubtless arise as to whether Dr\nRhine's other major subjects would fare any better if they crossed\nthe Atlantic. If any of them decide to visit England they may\nbe assured of the same courteous consideration and careful but dis-\npassionate examination that we have tried to accord Mrs Garrett.\nI append a statement by Mrs Garrett in which she compares the\nconditions of the present experiments with those obtaining in\nAmerica. This entirely voluntary statement was written by the\nmedium before she was told that the results had been entirely\nnegative.\nIt will be noted that Mrs Garrett actually prefers my methods to\nthose of Dr Rhine, and believes them to be better adapted to the\nfree play of her psychic powers. Indeed, by preserving a quiet\ndemeanour free from any violent display of emotion or over-anxiety\nfor positive results, I was simply conforming to what has been the\ntraditional creed of mental mediums since the dawn of Spiritualism.\nOver and over again one is warned in the works of Spiritualists of\nevery generation to \" keep calm and passive \", \"to relax the mind\nwhile sitting with the medium \", etc., etc. Above all we are warned\nnot to badger or press the \" spirits \" for evidential results or detailed\nanswers to questions ; we are to remain passive and hope for the best.\nI did not expect to obtain from Mrs Garrett the really extra-\nordinary results claimed by Dr Rhine, but I must confess that I did\nhope that a medium who had produced an average of 134 correct\nhits per 25 and maintained it over a succession of 25 packs of cards\nin North Carohna would, at any rate, be able to demonstrate a few\nlesser miracles in the country north of the Thames. At the same\ntime I realise that the medium may have been in some peculiar\n\f86 S. G. Soal I\n[PAET\nemotioual state at the time when she apparently succeeded with\nDr Rhine, and that possibly she has been unable to recapture this\nfavourable condition of mind since.\nAt any rate, I do not wish to convey the impression that Dr\nRhine did not actually succeed in obtaining highly significant\nresults in his work with Mrs Garrett. I merely record the fact that\nneither I nor my assistants succeeded in getting them.\nI should hke to add that the impression which Mrs Garrett pro-\nduced upon me was one of perfect honesty and straightforwardness\nand on this note of appreciation I will end. -\n>\nAppendix\nStatement by Mrs Garrett .\n,\n134 Piccadilly, London, W. 1,\n22nd June, 1937.\nI have been asked by Mrs Goldney to describe the difference\nin conditions, and what I might term \" psychological atmosphere\n\"\nat Duke University (working for Dr Rliine) and in London (working\nfor Mr Soal) ; further to say how I think that I, as an individual\nmedium, would respond to these conditions.\nWhen I first went to Duke University, I had no knowledge at\nall of what was expected of me. When I found it was card experi-\nments, with something that suggested a game of guessing, I natur-\nally was quite relieved for a day or two, and thought what was\nrequired of me was easy, and entered into the spirit of the thing.\nAfter a day or two of this, however, I began to suspect, though I\nwas not certain, that I was not using the same receptiveness in\nguessing that I use when I am working clairvoyantly. When I\ndiscovered that, I began to get fidgety, and bored with the cards.\nSo much so that I think Dr Rhine makes a note of my boredom in\nhis Report. Nevertheless I liked his personality, his cheerfulness,\nhis ease and his vitality ; and these qualities in him certainly made\nme feel I must give results. I still feel, however, that all my results\nat Duke were given in this vein, rather than in what I would describe\nas a spontaneously psychic working of my mediumship.\nI discussed while at Duke with Dr Rhine the suggestion that I\nshould work with Mr Soal, and remarked that I wondered how his\nvery different personahty, his quietness, and what might be called\nhis negative appeal to me, would affect results.\nI will now describe my work in London with him. To date I\nhave done about 4000 guessing experiments, and am to continue.\nI asked that I should not be told the results until the end ; I have.\n\f154] A Series of Experiments with Mrs Eileen Oarrett 87\nhowever, had a letter from Mr Soal telling me that the results are\n'\nmost interesting '\nand that it is urgent that I continue. Whether\n'\nmost interesting '\nmeans that the results are positive, or com-\npletely negative, I do not know. I fancy Mr Soal would regard\neither result as '\nmost interesting '. I find that while working with\nMr Soal I am able entirely to eHminate the cards, and the personahty\nof Mr Soal : in fact, the only thing of which I am conscious is the\nidea that I am to display my raediumship as best I can. There is\nno emotional tension, urging, or strain to produce results, such as\nis noticeable at Duke.\nHaving worked both ways I prefer the Soal method and set-up ;\nand would feel more at my ease in continuing these conditions than\ngoing back to those at Duke. Without knowing the results of my\nwork with Mr Soal, I feel that his method, and the conditions\nworking with him, would be more likely to bring out my medium-\nistic capabilities than would the Duke conditions. I would explain\nthis feeling I have by saying that it seems to me that mediumistic\npowers would best emerge where the conscious mind is allowed to\nsink back into passivity : this, I feel, is allowed with Mr Soal,\nwhereas at Duke it is being constantly stimulated into activity :\nthe results at Duke, I feel, are conscious guessing\u2014not the emerg-\nence of pure mediumistic powers.\nThe above description has been dictated to Mrs Goldney without\npreparation, and must be regarded as a spontaneous description of\nwhat I feel with regard to the difference in conditions of work for\nMr Soal and Dr Rhine, and how I respond in my feelings to these\nconditions.\nTo sum up : the conditions at Duke are tense and emotional in\ncomparison with those with Mr Soal in London. I, personally,\nprefer the quieter methods, divorced from constant urging and\n'\nsuggestion ', that pertain in London with Mr Soal : and I feel that\nmy mediumistic powers would be given more chance to emerge in\nthese quieter conditions. I shall be interested to find out whether\nthis is so in fact, after hearing the result of my work at the end of\nthe experiments.\n(Signed) Eileen J. Garrett.\nJune 22, 1937.\nNote by Mrs Goldney.

Harper s Magazine, Nov.\n1936 and Dec. 1936.\nPROFESSOR CHESTER E. KELLOGG of McGill University,\nNeiv Evidence {?)for \" Extra-Sensory Perception \". The Scienti-\nfic Monthly, October 1937, Vol. XLV, pages 331-341.\nIn the first of his articles Professor Wright, who is chairman of the\nDepartment of English Literature at Columbia University, gives a\nlucid and popular account of the alleged evidence for telepathy and\nclairvoyance as set forth by Dr J. B. Rhine in his work Extra-\nSensory Perception. Professor Wright, who is evidently a convert to\nthe belief that Extra-Sensory Perception has been demonstrated by\nDr Rhine and his associates, devotes much space in trying to con-\nvince the ordinary non-mathematical reader of the stupendous odds\nthere are against the theory that Dr Rhine's results are the work of\npure chance. Now, though there can be little doubt that Professor\nWright is justified in his general conclusion that the scores of many\nseries are due to something more than random variations in sampling,\nhe makes no serious attempt to examine any of the complicated\nstatistical problems that are involved. Such an attempt could per-\nhaps scarcely be expected in an article written for a popular maga-\nzine, but the author might have said something of the unsatisfactory\nconditions under which many of Dr Rhine's experiments appear to\nhave been carried out.\nIn his second article Professor Wright speculates as to the nature\nof Extra-Sensory Perception, but here again there is hardly anything\nthat is not to be found in Dr Rhine's own book. Following Dr Rhine,\nthe author concludes that clairvoyance cannot be ascribed to any\nform of radiation from the cards themselves which impinges on the\nbrain of the percipient. Telepathy and clairvoyance are considered\nas different modes of operation of a single power and it is noted that\nwhen a subject has telepathic ability he is also found to succeed in\nclairvoyance experiments. To sum up. Professor Wright's articles\ncontain hardly anything of interest to the serious student who is\ntrying to obtain a proper perspective of Dr Rhine's work, but they\nmay prove entertaining to the uninitiated.\n\f154] Reviews 89\nProfessor Kellogg's article, which was written as a reply to Pro-\nfessor Wright, merits, on the other hand, the most serious attention.\nIt is, in the main, an able, if somewhat prejudiced, attempt to under-\nmine Dr Rhine's position by attacking the validity of his statistical\nmethods.\nThat Professor Kellogg is a httle prejudiced against the idea of\nExtra-Sensory Perception is clear from certain of his opening para-\ngraphs.\nHe writes (p. 332) :\n\" Since Dr Rhine's reports have led to investigations in many\nother institutions, it might seem unnecessary to prick the bubble, as\nthe truth eventually will out and the craze subside. But meanwhile\nthe public is being misled, the energies of young men and women in\ntheir most vital years of professional training are being diverted into\na side-issue, and funds expended that might instead support re-\nsearch into problems of real importance for human welfare. This has\ngone so far that a new Journal of Para-psychology has been\nfounded. ...\"\nIt may well be of course that future research may show Dr\nRhine's claims to be without foundation, but I certainly do not think\nthat further experiments are unnecessary, as the result of Professor\nKellogg's article. For while I am in agreement with a great deal that\nhe says, I do not consider that he has disposed of Dr Rhine's case.\nThe author's prejudice is further revealed by his eulogy of Dr\nJ. E. Coover whose experiments with playing cards he describes\nas \" a notable example of painstaking, thorough research, and exact\ntreatment of numerical data.\" But as a matter of fact Coover's\nwork is by no means free from serious objections. He tried to obtain\na random sequence of cards by repeated shuffling and cutting of a\nsingle pack of 40 playing cards from which the 12 court cards had been\nremoved. But, as most people know, a pack of cards cuts more\neasily at certain places than at others. Moreover, shuffling by hand\nis a very inefficient process and I have found that after several\nshuffles there are sequences that are not broken up. Cards often\ntend to stick together here and there. If, therefore, Coover's pack\nhad a tendency to cut at such popular cards as the Ace of Spades, etc.,\nthe probability of a successful guess might be considerably greater\nthan 1\/40. Actually, as was pointed out by Professor Thouless^ in a\nseries of 10,000 guesses, the card was guessed correctly no fewer than\n294 times giving a deviation from the mean chance expectation of\n+44. The odds against this result being due to chance are about 200\nto 1. In a recent paper by Professor Cyril Burt (not yet published)\n1 S.P.R. Proceedings, Part 139, p. 27.\n\f90 Reviews [part\nit is satisfactorily shown that tlie odds against the whole of Coover's\nresults being the work of chance are of the order 50,000 to 1. If,\ntherefore, Coover's results are not chance results we must conclude\neither that there was some experimental error in his method or that.\nExtra-Sensory Perception was shown by certain of his subjects.\nMy own suggestion is that Coover's method of obtaining a random\ndistribution of cards was unsatisfactory for the reasons given above.\nThe correct method is the one I have adopted in my own experi-\nments, i.e. forming a random sequence of the digits 1-5 from mathe-\nmatical tables. As was shown by Weldon in his famous experiments,\neven dice cannot be relied upon to give a random distribution.\nBut Coover never even troubled to discover the reason why his\nresults were not in accordance with the laws of chance.\nI am in hearty agreement with Professor Kellogg when he says\nthat a large proportion of Rhine's experiments in Pure Clairvoyance\nare vitiated by the possibility of the subjects learning the cards from\nmarks on their backs, slight flexes, etc. This is a very real source of\nerror and should have been given far more careful attention by the\nexperimenters. Personally, I have never exposed a naked card to a\nsubject in the course of over 100,000 trials. Either a screen has been\nused or the card has been covered by a rectangle of white card-\nboard. Further, I have always made my subjects work through 40\ndifferent packs in succession.\nIt is also pointed out with perfect justice by Professor Kellogg that\nin experiments in so-called \" Pure \" telepathy, in which the agent\nthinks of a sequence of card images without using actual cards, the\nchance expectation is not accurately known. It is in such cases a\nmere assumption to say that in n guesses the mean chance expecta-\ntion is njb. There are altogether 5^^\" ways of choosing a sequence of\n25 Zener cards. But both agent and subject may confine themselves\nto an infinitesimal fraction of these 2-98 x 10^'^ permutations. My\nown experiments show that certain types of sequences have scarcely\nany chance of appearing . The general tendency is to change from\none symbol to another and such combinations as[000 + + +] may\nbe absent for months at a time.\nLast year two brothers, both highly intelhgent, described to me\nremarkable results which they had obtained by using the above\nmethod. Detailed lists were not available but the scores per 25\nwere highly significant on the assumption of a chance expectation\nof 5. I immediately set the brotliers to work, using a random se-\nquence of real cards in place of the sequences constructed mentally.\nThe scores fell at once to chance expectation and have never risen\nabove it in any significant sense. As the brothers did not use a screen\n\f154] Reviews 91\nin their experiments at home it seems probable that sensory codes\nconstructed unconsciously also played a part in the production of\ntheir apparently supernormal results.\nMoreover, neither Dr Khine nor Mr Tyrrell have published de-\ntailed lists of the card-images used in their experiments in Pure Tele-\npathy, and as apparently no records are kept of such lists, the\ninformation necessary for criticism is not available. Further, as\nProfessor Kellogg observes, Dr Rhine encouraged his agents to\nplan their mental sequences in groups of five. Now the effort to\nkeep the numbers of each symbol about equal almost inevitably\ntends to cause the agent to choose about one of each symbol per set\nof five. . . .\nHence the success of the Fisk plan in the case when the subject is\ntold when he has made a correct guess. If, on the other hand, the\nagent tries to avoid this pitfall he will find the greatest difficulty in\ndistributing his total evenly over the five symbols.\nThe next important criticism that Professor Kellogg makes is that\nDr Rhine (and the same observation applies to Mr Tyrrell) refuses to\nrecord and analyse the sum total of his records. If the subjects do\nbadly on certain days, then it is said that the failure is due to some\npsychological disturbance and the results obtained on such days are\nignored. But as obviously the statistical data themselves are the\nonly criterion of the existence of an extra-chance factor we are, if\nwe adopt such methods, moving in a vicious circle. Professor Kel-\nlogg argues that either all the data should be included in the analysis\nor that a random selection from the total data should be made and\nthen analysed. I do not agree with Professor Kellogg in his sugges-\ntion of a random selection. It might well be that Extra-Sensory\nPerception is an intermittent faculty and it seems to me that a far\nbetter method would be to chop up the whole series into consecutive\ngroups of 25 guesses or even groups of 5 guesses. Then, in the case\nof groups of 25, the numbers of scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., successes\nshould be compared with the terms of the expansion of N[^+^]^^\nwhere N is the (large) number of groups of 25. Any extra-chance\nfactor which operated unevenly on the different sets of 25 would, in\nthe long run, be revealed by this method. If the method revealed\nno abnormal number of sixes, sevens, etc., the same method should\nbe apphed to groups of 5, using the expansion of -1-3^]^.\nWe are now brought face to face with one of Professor Kellogg's\nmain criticisms. As Dr Rhine, unfortunately, does not use a per-\nfectly random sequence of cards he cannot in strictness apply the\nBinomial Distribution in the way suggested above. The packs\nused by Dr Rhine contain exactly five cards of each symbol. Now\nF\n\f92 Beviews [part\neven if the subject guessed exactly five cards of each symbol for\nevery pack, the number of scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., would not pre-\ncisely agree with the numbers predicted by the expansion of\nThe true theoretical distribution can only be found by the methods\nof combinatory analysis and is given by Professor Kellogg in his\narticle, though curiously he omits certain entries. The general effect\nis for the Binomial distribution to slightly underestimate both the\nnumber of lotv scores {e.g. 0, 1, etc.) and the number of high scores\n{e.g. 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.) while it overestimates scores near the mean\n{e.g. 5, etc.)\nThe differences however {in the ideal case in wJiich the subject\nguesses each symbol 5 ti?nes in 25 guesses) are not very serious.\nFor example the number of sets with scores ^7 would according\nto the true distribution be nearly N x 0-229, whereas the Binomial\ndistribution would predict N x 0-220 where N is the total number\nof sets of 25. Again the number of sets with scores ^9 would by\nthe true distribution amount to iVx 0-051, whereas the Binomial\nwould predict N x -047 approximately.\nProfessor Kellogg's table, however, would appear to be of little\npractical use since subjects hardly ever trouble to guess exactly\nfive of each symbol for each pack of 25. What is required is a solu-\ntion to the more general problem in which the subject guesses %\ncircles, n^ waves, etc., where -f- \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022\n-I-\n\u2022\u2022 \u2022n^ = 25. It is this general\nproblem which I hope to discuss in the forthcoming report on my\nrepetition of Dr Rhine's work. To take an example (which how-\never would never occur in practice) suppose that, using Dr Rhine's\npacks, the subject says \"\nO \" every guess. In this case all his\nscores per 25 will be exactly 5 and Professor Kellogg's distribution\nbreaks down entirely. A case which is more likely to occur in actual\nexperiments is where the guesser tends to avoid some one of the five\nsymbols. He may, for example, dislike guessing the -I- since it\nreminds him of death. If he avoided the + altogether and used\nDr Rhine's packs his scores would\n\u2014\nthough only roughly\u2014be dis-\ntributed according to the Binomial iV[f instead of accord-\ning to N[^+^Y^. This is not quite accurate but it gives a rough\nidea of the change that has taken place.\nYet for a large number n of individual guesses there would not be\nmuch error in taking the standard deviation as x J x -f,\ni.e. 0-4 Jn\nsince this would now be replaced (approximately) by\nV|wxixf =0-387 s\/n.\n\f154] Reviews 93\nIt is, I think, probable that Professor Kellogg greatly exaggerates\nthe importance of the error arising from the use of the formula\nX ^ X f employed by Dr Rhine throughout his work. A further\nslight error tending in the same direction arises from the use of the\nNormal Probability tables in connection with estimates of signifi-\ncance based on the Binomial Distribution. But here again the\ndiscrepancy is small when 7i the number of guesses is large, say 300.\nProbably the most crucial series of experiments recorded by Dr\nRliine are those described in the Journal of Abnormal and Social\nPsychology, Vol. XXXI, No. 2, July-September, 1936. These were\ncarried out with Dr Pratt and the subject, Hubert Pearce, in different\nbuildings of Duke University. The experiments were in Pure Clair-\nvoyance and there are altogether 73 runs of 25, two such runs being\nmade each day. The pack was shuffled after each run through and\nthe records were \" sealed after each sitting and deUvered to me (Dr\nRhine) before subject and observer got together.\"\nDr Rhine divides the series into four groups A, B, C, D. Groups\nA, C, D were made with the experimenter in the Physics Building and\nthe subject in the library. The distance was about 100 yards. In\ngroup B the subject was still in the library, but the experimenter,\nDr Pratt, was in the Medical Building, the distance being now about\n250 yards.\nIn view of Professor Kellogg's criticism of these experiments it\nwill be useful to give the scores here in full.\nA : 3, 8, 5, 9, 10, 12, 11, 11, 12, 13, 13, 12.\nB : 12, 10, 6, 4, 10, 10, 2, 6, 5, 12, 7, 5, 12, 11, 9, 10, 6, 3, 0, 13, 10,\n12, 12, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 7, 6, 5, 0, 6, 3, 11, 9, 9, 4, 8, 6, 0, 6.\nC : 5, 4, 11, 8, 4, 9, 9, 8, 9, 10, 2, 7.\nD : 12, 3, 10, 11, 10, 10.\nIn Group D Dr Rhine was with Dr Pratt as an observer.\nIn these remarkable series all sensory cues were of course ruled\nout and as Dr Rhine explicitly states (p. 221) that these four series\nrepresent all the tests given to Pearce with the cards in one building\nand the subject in another it cannot I think be fairly objected that\nthey are a selected series. In fact, as we shall see later, a million\npersons might go on guessing for years without producing such a series.\nProfessor Kellogg in his article has not made it clear how he esti-\nmates the significance of these series. As he has obviously not used\nthe formula employed by Rhine, i.e. Jn-pq, to which he objects, we\nassume that he uses a method that does not presuppose a Binomial\ndistribution. Such a method would be to calculate the observed\nmean and standard deviations from the scores themselves and assum-\nF 2\n\f\u00a74 Reviews [part\ning\u2014as we certainly may\u2014that the theoretical mean expectation\nfor 25 guesses is very approximately 5, then calculate the standard\ndeviation of the mean from the formula o\/ JN where o is the ob-\nserved standard deviation and N is the number of sets in the group.\ntn the case of small groups like A, C, D we should use instead\n\" Student's \" formula for \" t'\\ Such methods are of course crude\nas they ignore the true nature of the actual distribution, but the\nerror is on the safe side. Now, of the whole series A, B, C, D which\ncontains 73 sets of 25 {i.e. 1825 guesses) I find for the observed\nvariance\n(T '^\u20225Q'^\n(72=12-90. Hence -p==^^= 042.\nV73 s\/73\nBut the observed mean score is 7-52. Hence the deviation of the\nmean from 5-00 is 2-52, i.e. 6 times the Standard Deviation and the\nchance of getting a deviation lying ourside the range \u00b16 x s.d. is\nabout 10^9.\nIf we use the ordinary Binomial formula\nJnx^x^= 71825x^x1\nwe find the deviation to be 10-8 x s.d.\nDr Kellogg, however, complains that this formula takes no\naccount of the internal consistency of the scores. But we have seen\nthat even using the other method we obtain a highly significant\nresult. Yet all Professor Kellogg has to say about the series as a whole\nis :\n\" Taking all the groups together, the results are positive and\nsomewhat significant, perhaps sufficiently so to warrant further\nstudy of the problem.\"\nOf Group \" B \" he writes :\n\" Group A remains significant, Group\nB is just above the border line. ...\" But employing the same\nmethod for Group B I find\nNo. of sets of 25 =43.\nMean Score =6-70.\nObserved value of a = 3-68.\nHence\nHence the deviation of the mean from 5-00 the expected value is\n1-70, which is just over 3 times the standard deviation. The odds\nagainst such a deviation + or - being due to chance are about 370\nto 1 and would be considered significant by most modern psycholo-\ngists.\n\f154] Reviews 95\nProfessor Kellogg states that groups C and D are \" well within the\nlimits of ordinary chance accepted by scientists as not demanding\nspecial investigation and explanation.\"\nApplying \" Student's \" method to Group C I find i = 2-7 which\nwith n\u2014ll gives P= 0-02 (nearly).\nFor Group D, I find i = 3-30 which with re = 5 gives P=0-02 (nearly).\nIt would appear that considered separately neither of the groups\nC and D is very significant by this method, but I have little doubt\nthat the significance is seriously underestimated by using Student's\nformula. Moreover there is no reason to consider C and D separately\nsince series A, C, D were done under practically the same conditions\nof distance.\nIf we applied the formula Vl50 x f x ^ to series D we should ob-\ntain a deviation amounting to over 6 times the S.D. I have never in\nall my experience met with a set of 6 consecutive groups of 25\nwhich contained 5 sets with scores all ^10. In fact the greatest\nnumber of scores J^IO which I have obtained in 6 consecutive sets\nof 25 is 2.\nIn the 73 sets of 25 which comprise Groups A, B, C, D the number\nof sets with scores is predicted by the Binomial distribution to\nbe 16-1 and by the distribution given by Kellogg 16-7. Actually,\nthere are no less than 42 such scores. Now, although neither Kellogg's\ndistribution nor the Binomial distribution represent the true dis-\ntribution for reasons explained above, it is improbable that the ex-\npected number differs much from 17. We think, therefore, that\nProfessor Kellogg's remarks are misleading ; the whole series of\n73 sets is stupendously significant. In fact, since P=10~^ for the\nwhole series it would take a million men doing each 1,825,000\nguesses to win the same degree of significance.\nIndeed, if the honesty of the investigators is not disputed this\nseries would appear to estabhsh the existence of a clairvoyant faculty\nin man. It is at the same time regrettable that Drs Rhine and Pratt,\nwith the knowledge that they were getting epoch-making results\nunder conditions beyond criticism, did not take every possible\nprecaution to guard themselves against any suspicion of collusion.\nUnder such circumstances my own procedure would have been as\nfollows ; I should have arranged for the head of another department\nof the University to be present in the Physics or Medical Buildings to\nwitness and actually perform the shuffling of the pack and the record-\ning of the actual card sequences. \/ should have instructed him to\ntake every precaution that I did not substitute a \" prepared \" pack for\nthe one tvhich he had himselfshuffled. The head of another department\nwould have been waiting outside the Library to collect personally\n\f96 Reviews [part\nPearce's guesses immediately they were finished. The two heads of\ndepartments would then have met and compared the records.\nSince Pearce was alone in another building it could scarcely be\nurged that the presence of the second observer in the Physics\nBuilding could have affected his scoring, especially as the experi-\nments were tests in clairvoyance.\nA few concluding remarks about the four groups A, B, C, D may\nnot be out of place. Group B, which is the largest, is an excessively\nvariable set of scores. For instance there is one 13 and no less than\nthree zeros. There are 288 successes in 1075 guesses so that the\nobserved YsXvLGSi of p, and g are jo = 0-2679, 5' = 0-7321. On the assump-\ntion of a Binomial distribution the expected variance cr^ with these\nvalues of f and q is given by cr = 2-214, whereas the observed variance\nis given by ai = 3-68.\nOn the assumption of a Binomial distribution, the Standard error\nof the variance is given by\nV N\nwhere N is the number of sets and '\n-\n'\nWe thus find .= -\n'\nf\n\\ N V 43\n= 1-05.\nButa^^ =13-549, a2 =4-903.\nHence the deviation of the variance from its expected value is about\n8-6 X Standard Error. It will be seen, therefore, that Series B cannot\nbe fitted to a Binomial distribution and we must assume that what-\never extra-chance agency is at work operates very unevenly on\nthe different sets of 25. In fact, if the agency is Extra-Sensory Per-\nception we can only conclude that it works in a most fantastic\nmanner, pulling some scores down to zero and raising others to 12\nand 13.\nS. G.

They consist of a paper by Prof.\nBroad on the Philosophical Implications of Foreknowledge, a com-\nmentary thereon by Prof. Price, and Prof. Broad's reply thereto.\nIt is surely a fact of great significance that a body of men and\nwomen of such eminence in the world of philosophy as those assembled\nat the Joint Meeting of The Aristotelian Society and the Mind\nAssociation should have welcomed a discussion on a subject con-\nnected with psychical research. Though we have been able to count\namong our members some of the greatest of modern thinkers, the\nprofessional philosopher, as a general rule, has not been friendly to-\nwards our subject, even if he has not been openly antagonistic.\nIt may be said that his opposition need not be unduly feared, less\nso, indeed, than his apathy, but the friendly co-operation of the pro-\nfessional philosopher would be a great assistance. It would be of the\nhighest advantage if all concepts employed, all hypotheses suggested,\nshould be criticised from the standpoint of logic and philosophy, and\nnone allowed standing room until they have been so \" vetted \".\nIt is this function which Professor Broad undertook in his paper ;\nhe did not examine the evidence for supernormal precognition, nor\npass an opinion as to its reality ; but he first of all clarified the mean-\ning of the terms in his own inimitable manner and then discussed\nwhat consequences for philosophy would follow if the alleged facts\nwere actually true. He laid down that if it involves a logical or\nmetaphysical impossibility, the evidence for precognition, however\nseemingly strong, must be rejected.\nIn this, though many would agree with him, there are doubtless\nsome people who would demur. While, they might say, there is so\nlittle agreement among philosophers, even on such fundamentals as\nthe self-evident truths, the claim that metaphysics and logic must\nbe the final court of appeal cannot be admitted. There are many\ndifferent systems of metaphysics and there will, in all probabihty,\nbe many more in the future, nor is logic a completed science.\nMoreover, metaphysics and logic themselves rest, in the last resort,\nupon experience, viz. the experience by which we recognise certain\npropositions to be self-evident ; from experience we cannot derive\n\f98 Reviews [part\nnecessary truth. When, therefore, logical and metaphysical impos-\nsibility is set over against the evidence for precognition, it is only one\nset of experiences, with inferences drawn therefrom, which is being\nopposed to another set.\nProf. Broad then examined the three main philosopliical objections,\nviz. the epistemological, the causal and the fatalistic.\nIn discussing the first of these, he points out that the proper\nanalogue of precognition is memory and not, as many have appeared\nto think, perception. In elaborating this point, he makes some\nobservations on the subject of normal memory\u2014as does also Prof.\nPrice in his comments\u2014which have value for psychology and phil-\nosophy in general, as well as for psychical research. By assimilating\nprecognition to memory, he shows that the epistemological objection\nis not insuperable.\nIn this matter of memory both symposiasts agree in holding some\nform of the \" trace \" theory as being most probable.

The Mind and its Place in Nature and in his Presidential\nAddress, postulates traces of a psychical nature, while Prof. Price\nthinks that the traces are, at any rate partially, physical, that is to\nsay, they involve modifications in the cerebro-neural structure.\nTrace theories have not met with general acceptance ; Russell has\nput forward an entirely different suggestion, and seeks to account for\nnormal memory by postulating what he calls mnemic causation.\nThis is a form of causation which operates across a time interval, it\nis able to jump the ditch. Should Russell's theory be accepted, it\nis, perhaps, a not very difficult step, from the epistemological point\nof view, to suppose that the jump can be made backwards, i.e. from\nfuture to present, as well as forwards, i.e. from past to present.\nCausal difficulties would, no doubt, arise, but mnemic causation is\nitself so odd and incomprehensible that a little extra oddity need\nnot worry us undidy.\nConcerning physical traces I would refer the reader to McDougall's\nModern Materialism, Chap. IV, and Note 7.\nPsychical traces, on the other hand, while avoiding some of the\nobjections which can be brought against the physical theory, are\nentities of so unimaginable a kind that it is hard to say what they can\nor cannot do, and when or how they can be formed.\nI suggest that until we know more concerning the real nature of\nnormal memory, we cannot draw any safe conclusions from the\nanalogue between it and precognition.\nProf. Price, in his comments, suggests that our conception of an\nevent might be modified by postulating the existence of \" imagy \",\nas well as \" sensible \" constituents. The sensible constituents are\n\f164] Beviev)^ 99\nthose which give rise to sense perception and they exist only for the\nfinite duration of the event, the imagy constituents give rise to images\nand they may exist both before and after the event. Tliis is, admit-\ntedly, a somewhat \" wild \" hypothesis, but, as both Professors\nBroad and Price admit, one may be compelled to entertain wild\nhypotheses when confronted with supernormal facts.\nI have made special mention of tliis suggestion because it seems to\nme that those who are inclined to accord to it a favourable reception\nmight find therein a possible explanation of several otherwise refrac-\ntory types of supernormal phenomena, e.g. hauntings and psycho-\nmetry.\nProf. Broad's discussion of the causal objection reveals the full\nextent of the difiiculties. The existence of non-inferential pre-\ncognition appears to conflict with self-evident propositions concern-\ning causation, but he suggests a possible escape by postulating a\nsecond dimension of time, which, even if a wild hypothesis, is not\nlogically impossible.\nProf. Price, in his comments, makes a very valuable amendment\nby showing that many difiiculties could be avoided by bringing in\ntelepathy, and this leads Prof. Broad to an interesting discussion\nof that subject.\nIt seems to me that if this suggestion of telepathy combined with\na second dimension of time be entertained, the difiiculties arising from\nthe Unking of precognition with memory might be surmounted. In\nfact, it might be worth considering whether a novel theory of normal\nmemory might not be constructed out of the same material.\nThe last, i.e. the fatalist objection, is shown, by an acute analysis,\nto be not insuperable.\nThe upshot of the whole discussion appears to be that, although\nacceptance of the reahty of non-inferential precognition may commit\none to the entertainment of wild hypotheses, there is no insuperable\nlogical difficulty.\nIt must be admitted that these three papers are not easy reading,\nbut for those who desire to go to the roots of the matter, a close study\nof them will be labour well spent. It is becoming increasingly clear\nthat some overlapping between psychical research and metaphysics\ncannot be avoided, and those researchers who have the ambition to\npush their enquiries beyond the stage of the collection and classifi-\ncation of evidence must make up their minds, however reluctantly,\nto a certain amount of logical and metaphysical criticism.\nH. F. Saltmaesh.\n\f100 Reviews [part\nIII\nC. Spearman, Psychology down the Ages. Macmillan & Co., Ltd..\n1937. 2 Vols., 454 +355 pp., 30s.\nIn his earlier books Professor Spearman has made distinguished\ncontributions to modern experimental psychology. In The Nature\nof Intelligence and the Principles of Cognition (1923), he laid down a\nsystem of laws of the intellectual processes of the mind culminating\nin his three \" noegenetic principles \" which he regarded as parti-\ncularly connected with the operation of intelligence or \" general\nability \". These were : (l) A person tends to know himself ami items\nof his own experience, (2) On the presentation of two or more items, a\nperson tends to know relations between them (as, for example, when the\npresentation of the items of \" heat \" and \" cold \" produces the know-\nledge of the fact that one is the opposite of the other), and, (3) On\ntlie presentation of an item., together with a relation, a person tends to\nconceive the correlative item (as when the presentation of the item of\n\" heat \" and the relation of \" oppositeness \" produces the know-\nledge of the correlative item of \" cold \").\nIn The Abilities of Man (1927), he gave an account of the remark-\nable series of measurements in the field of educational psychology\ncarried out by himself and his pupils following his earher suggestion\n(1904) that the problem of whether there was a unitary general intel-\nligence might be tested by examining the mathematical relation-\nships between the correlation coefficients of different test results and\nschool examinations.\nThe second volume of the present book is mainly concerned with\nthese two lines of investigation. It shows how Spearman believes\nthat the main facts in the intellectual and orectic field can be re-\nduced to a system of laws, and the strength of the evidence for the\nproposition that there is a general intellectual ability (or G) which is\nthe \" intelligence \" measured by intelligence tests and which deter-\nmines, to a greater or lesser degree, intellectual abilities in all fields.\nThe first volume is an account of the rival doctrines on such matters\nas \" intelligence \", \" attention \", etc., about which philosophers and\npsychologists have disputed since very early times. The main\nimpression that one gets from the two volumes is of the way in which\nverbal disputes can lead to no final settlement of the problems of\nthe mind until these are submitted to the test of crucial experiments.\nIf this is, as I imagine it to be, the central purpose of the book, there\ncan be no doubt that Spearman is demonstrating one of the most\nimportant principles in the development of scientific psychologists.\nPhysics would still be a matter of verbal discussions on the nature\n\f154] Reviews 101\nof \" force \" if it had not been redeemed from this state by the experi-\nments of the early physicists. In the same way, psychological laws\nwill only stand firm so far as they are founded on the rock of experi-\nmental evidence.\nSpearman's theory of general ability is a brilHant example of the\nreplacement of free speculation by experimental testing. It is not,\nhowever, the only one, and the author seems not always to be alto-\ngether just to experimental workers with whose conclusions he dis-\nagrees. The Gestalt psychologists, for example, have performed\ndistinguished service in the experimental study of the field of per-\nception, but the reader of chapter XXIV in vol. I with the unhappy\ntitle of \" The Confusion that is Gestalt Psychology \" might easily\ngather that Gestalt Psychology has been nothing but a system of\nspeculations.\nThe title of these volumes might suggest that this is simply another\nhistorical account of psychology, of which many have been written\nduring recent years. Valuable though the historical introduction\nin the first volume is, I think it is true to say that in these volumes\nProfessor Spearman has done something more interesting and more\nworth while than merely to add another history of psychology.\nRobert H. Thouless.\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 155\nA STUDY OF CERTAIN LEONARD PHENOMENA ^\nBy Isabel Newton\nThose who have had sittings with Mrs Leonard are doubtless\nfamiliar with the kind of impressions that are given through Feda ^\nconcerning the sitter and other persons\u2014or it may be places\u2014who,\nfor one reason or another, are associated with the sitting. But as\nMrs Leonard's sitters are limited in number, and there must be\nmany members who have had no personal experience of her trance\nphenomena, I will explain that frequently at sittings the \" com-\nmunicator \" claims to have visited some specified place, or person,\nand to have picked up \" certain ideas or \" sensed \" certain\nconditions during the visit. The term \" impression \" is used in the\ntelepathic sense, namely, as denoting the effect produced on the\nmind or feeling of the percipient, the person who \" perceives\n\"\notherwise than through the recognised channels of sense.\nA considerable number of such impressions are scattered through-\nout the verbatim records of the Rev. W. S. Irving's sittings, which\nhave been held at regular intervals since 1921, and of these, 228\nrefer to the S.P.R., its Officers, and the occupants of the Society's\nhouse. It is these particular impressions, together with six that\nwere given at two of Mrs Allison's sittings with Mrs Leonard, that\nform the subject of this paper.\nThe purpose of the paper is not to put forward a reasoned case for\ntelepathy ; I am assuming that in these impressions we have evi-\ndence of telepathy, and that the examples illustrating the text will\nenable readers to form their own opinion on this point. My paper is\n1 This paper was read, slightly abridged, at a Private Meeting of the Society\non March 30, 1938.\n^ Mrs Leonard's control.\nG 103\n\f104 Isabel Newton [PAET\nan attempt to bring order into a confused collection of impressions,\nat first sight unconnected, fragmentary, and in no way distinctive ;\nand to find some unity in them, which might throw light on the\nquestion why trivial and passing thoughts are so often perceived,\nwhile vivid and emotional experiences are apparently ignored. The\nexamination of the impressions which relate to myself have sug-\ngested an explanation, which I shall put forward, tentatively, when\nI come to the \" Isabel \" section.\nThe impressions are given in series, and are referred either to\n\" the Searchers \", Feda's name for the Society, or to \" Mrs Isabel \",\nFeda's name for me. They are prefaced by such remarks as \" She's\nbeen to the Searchers \" (or, it may be, to \" Mrs Isabel's \"), \" She's\ngot a test from the Searchers' place \", or \" She wants to say some-\nthing about the Searchers \" ;\n\" She \", in each case, being Mr\nIrving's communicator, \" Dora \". Then follows a series of impres-\nsions varying in number from two or three to as many as a dozen or\nso. The subject is then dismissed with \" That's all about the\nSearchers\", or \"That's all about Mrs Isabel\". Occasionally an\nimpression is forgotten, remembered later in the sitting, and referred\nback to a previous context.^ There is an example of this in the\n\" Isabel \" series, where not only is the impression referred back to\na previous group of impressions, but apparently is related to a\nparticular impression in the group, as will be seen when I quote the\ncase in another connection.\n^\nMr Hubert Wales in his experiments with Miss Samuels (reported\nin Proceedings, Part LXXX, Vol. XXXI) failed to find evidence of\nany capacity on the part of the percipient to group various impres-\nsions relevant to a particular topic, so as to suggest the unity of any\nmind other than that of the agent. Now here, it seems to me that\nin this quite definite grouping of impressions we have evidence of\nsuch a capacity, though with regard not to a topic, but to a plan or\npurpose ; otherwise we should expect to find the impressions given\nindiscriminately with the rest of the trance material. The purpose\nis, presumably, to give Mr Irving evidence of supernormal know-\nledge at his next sitting.\nThe two groupings are distinct and yet connected, \" The\nSearchers \" merging into \" Mrs Isabel \", and vice versa ; but there\nis no confusion between them. Throughout the series the \" Isabel\n\"\nimpressions are personal, and (with three or four exceptions, which\nI call borderland cases) do not touch on my relation to the Society.\nIn \" The Searchers \" series I am unrecognised, yet recognition of my\nconnection with the Society is shown in such references as :\n\" The\n1 e.g., see pp. 111-112. ^\np 12O.\n\f155] A Study of Certain Leonard Phenomena 105\nSearchers' Isabel \", and \" I went to the Office, where the Searchers\nare, and she wasn't there, Mrs Isabel wasn't there \".\nExcept in the six impressions given at Mrs Allison's sittings when\nProfessor J. H. Hyslop purported to communicate, the ostensible\npercipient is Dora, Mr Irving's wife, who died nearly twenty years\nago. (Perhaps I had better state here that the question whether it\nis really Dora or whether it is Mrs Leonard who is the percipient\ndoes not come within the range of this paper\nI have said that the total number of impressions was 234. But\non examination I found that of these a large number\u201457, to be\nexact\u2014were given when either Mr or Mrs Dingwall (Mr Dingwall\nbeing then an Officer of the Society), or later Mr Besterman, was\npresent as note-taker, and that they referred to events that were\nprobably within the note-taker's knowledge. These cases furnish\nsome points of interest in a complete study of the whole material,\nbut as they do not come within the limits of this particular study I\nhave eliminated them. We have, therefore, now a total of 177. of\nwhich 61 are associated by the percipient with the Society, and 116\nwith \" Mrs Isabel \".\nBefore giving examples, I should like to state again, as Mrs\nSalter did when cjuoting a few of the earliest impressions in her\n\" Report on Sittings with Mrs Leonard \" {Proceedings, Part 99,\nVol. XXXVI), namely, that Mrs Leonard has never visited the\nSociety's house at 31 Tavistock Square. (Nor has she ever visited me\nin my own home.) Nor have we any grounds for suspecting that\nthere may be normal leakage of information about events in this\nhouse, though in a few cases it might, by chance, have been possible.\nSuch cases are extremely rare.\nI should also lilie to endorse Mrs Salter's acknowledgement, in\nher paper, of the Society's indebtedness to Mr Irving, not only for\nplacing at its disposal all his records of sittings, much of which is of\na private and intimate nature, but also for the great care and\ntrouble he has taken to comply with its requirements. The accuracy\nof his records are all independently attested. His annotations were\npromptly made, and wherever possible he has obtained independent\nconfirmation.\nI I have not found one impression that could be quoted as helping to deter-\nmine this question. When stripped of the Feda-Dora context the impressions\nare comparable with those of Miss Samuels, or so it seems to me ; but this\nopinion is based on a few examples only, taken at random from Mr Wales's\nReport. The sense of reality produced by Feda's lively presentation of the\nimpressions, and by the personalit3' of Dora as therein revealed, is not easy\nto resist. I hope that Mr Kenneth Richmond will deal with this part of the\nmaterial in his studies of communicator-personalities.\n\f106 Isabel Neivton [part\nDora is represented as coming to the house and \" picking up\n\"\nthoughts and ideas. With reference to her telepathic excursions in\ngeneral, she says, \" I always sense the place and not always when\nthere's some one in it\u2014you know, projected thoughts. I help\nmyself to them.\" She frequently expresses uncertainty as to\nwhether her percept is of a thought or of something that has been\nspoken of or discussed ; also as to whether it refers to something\nthat has already happened or to something that is anticipated. On\nthis point, Feda observed on one occasion : \"I found out before\nthat Dora doesn't always know the difference between to-day and a\nquick tomorrow.\"\nShe does not know either the identity of the mind from which the\nthoughts are derived.\nThe majority of the impressions refer to small happenings in the\noffice ; the following will serve as examples :\nJanuary 25, 1927.\nFeda : \"Is there some one new coming to work in the Psychical\nSearchers?\n\"\"\nShe got the feehng of some one new coming to work\nthere.\nMr Irving' s contemporary note is :\nMiss Sanderson had recently started work at the Rooms, during the\nabsence of Miss Wallace.\nIn my confirmatory note I stated that Miss Sanderson began her\nwork for the Society on January 15 (that is, ten days before the\nsitting). ,\nFeda continued :\n\" New arrangement! Now she doesn't know how to put this, for\ncollecting the subscriptions. New arrangement about collecting\nthe subscriptions being thought of in that room.\nMr Irving's contemporary note is :\nMiss Newton tells me that, a few days before the sitting, she advised\nMiss Horsell [the Assistant Secretary] to give to Miss Sanderson\na certain work to do. It was to take over the noting of the receipt-\nof subscriptions.\nMy own and Miss Horsell's confirmation is added to this note.\nAt the same sitting {January 25, 1927) an impression was given\nwhich suggests the identity of the agent by indicating the room with\nwhich he was associated :\nFeda : She's got to show me this! Ask them if the top's come\nunstuck off something that they use in that room. Look! She\ngot a mental vision of some one doing this (Feda closes her fists,.\n\f155] A ShuJy of Certain Leonard Phenomena 107\nholds them close together, and twists the right one, shghtly tapping\nthe left with the right), and of saying \" Isn't it a noosance! \" Like\ntrying to press.\nMr Irving's contemporary note is :\nOn Friday, January 28, 1927, I looked up Mr Dingwall in his room\nat the S.P.R. When I rapped at the door, he said, \" Come in \",\nbut I could not open the door. When leaving the room the same\nthing happened, I again could not open the door. Mr Dingwall\nshowed me how to open it inside by pressing down the handle.\nHis illustration was exactly like Feda's action, and reminded me of\nthe test.\nMr Ding-wall added the following contemporary note :\nThe door to my room at the S.P.R. is inchned to stick in wet\nweather. Lately it has been especially troublesome, and few\npeople can open it. To open it from without the handle should\nbe gripped with both hands and the handle then pressed down.\nFeda continued :\nDora says \" You remember last time I gave you a funny little\ntest . . . the name Violet in connection with it? Well now, I don't\nwant you to think it means the same thing, it doesn't . . . ask\nhas some one had violets in this room, just lately, just now? And\nwas there anything in connection with the violets about forgetting\nthem, or nearly losing them? Forgetting seems the stronger\nimpression.\nMr Dingwall's note is :\nOn Tuesday, January 25, 1927, 1 attended a sitting with the apport\nmedium, Mr Mills Tanner ; violets were produced as apports, and\nwith difficulty I managed to secure one. On coming home I looked\nin my pockets for the flower but had a sudden shock of disappoint-\nment when I could not find it. Later it turned up in an inner\nbreast pocket of my jacket. Flower herewith.\nThis impression of the violets is one of the two impressions in the\nwdiole series which seem to have a precognitive element. I shall\nrefer to it again when quoting the other case, in the \" Isabel \" series.\nThe next is one of the cases I had in mind when I said that normal\nleakage might have been possible. It will be noted that there is an\nassociation between it and the impression immediately following it.\nMay 6, 1930.\nFeda : AVill you ask the Psychical Searchers this? . . . whether\nthey have got, either to-day, or tomorrow, a large quantity\nof MS. coming in, which must be dealt with? Not ours, not\nours. No! But something coming in\u2014like, in the next day\nor two\u2014which seem to Dora to be ... a heavy collection, something\n\f108 Isabel Newton [part\nthat would necessitate, and has necessitated a great deal of work\n. . . That some part of this MS. would refer to Greek, Greek, The\nGreek, the Greek.\nMr Salter's ^ note, abridged, is as follows :\nMr Besterman and I attended the 4th International Congress for\nPsychical Eesearch at Athens in April 1930. On the evening of the\n22nd April a Business Meeting was held, at which, on behalf of the\nS.P.R., Mr Besterman and I undertook to have the Transactions\nedited in England. This Business Meeting was a comparatively\nsmall one, consisting only of official delegates from the different\nNational Societies ; there may have been a round dozen of persons\npresent.\nOn April 27, Mr Besterman and I left Athens by boat for Marseilles.\nHe brought with him a considerable number of the papers read at\nthe Congress ... I travelled straight back from Marseilles to\nEngland. He broke his journey at Paris and stayed two or three\ndays there. I doubt whether on the 6th May any persons other\nthan my wife, Miss Newton, Mr Besterman and myself were aware\nthat there was any suggestion that the Transactions of the Athens\nConference were to be edited in England. The matter was brought\nup at the next Council Meeting on May 14, 1930.\nFeda continued :\nShe says that she also felt that they have been ordering some new\nbooks. They may possibly have arrived by the time you enquire,\nbut she knew they were ordered, do you see?\nMr. Besterman's note :\nOn my way back from Athens I spent two or three days in Paris\nbuying books for the Society's Library. This was at the beginning\nof May, before the above sitting.\nx4.1though there was no diminution in the total number of impres-\nsions given during the years 1928-1936, those referring to the\nSearchers grew less and less frequent, the proportion during that\nperiod being only 21 (including 14 of the eliminated cases) to 90 in\nthe \" Isabel \" series.\nIn July 1936 Mr Herbert - began to arrange a special book-test\nexperiment, which Mr Irving broached to Feda at his sitting the\nsame month. A collection of books, including one specially prepared,\nwas placed in the seance room and Dora was encouraged to indicate\nthe position of the special book. It was not until November 1936\nthat the experiment was fully understood by Feda and Dora, and.\nthey agreed to co-operate. At the next sitting, which was held on\n' Mr W. H. Salter, Hon. Secretary of the Society.\n^ Research Officer of the Society.\n\f155] A Study of Certain Leonard Phenomena 109\nJanuary 19, 1937, impressions referring to the Searchers began again,\nand continued during the year. I will quote a few examples :\nThe first is a borderland case, probably partly \" Mrs Isabel \" and\npartly \" the Searchers \". To make this point clearer I will fijst\ngive my contemporary note, abridged :\nOn Sunday, January 17, 1937, Professor and Mme Dessoir, of\nBerlin, who were visiting London, had tea with me in my flat.\nProfessor Dessoir asked me if I had received the photograph of Mrs\nSidgwick which he had asked a member of the Society, with whom\nhe was in correspondence, to send to the Society. We had not\nreceived it. He then said he would send it to the office the next\nday, which he did. We received this photograph of Mrs Sidgwick\nduring the morning of January 18, 1937, the day before the sitting,\nwhen the following impression was given :\nFeda : Mr Bill, will you please find out too, is there a new picture\nthere that's important? Or, are they just getting a new picture,\na portrait one? Dora felt the thought so strongly. Dora says,\n\" I hope I've picked it up, the thought, before they've got the\npicture. I hope I've picked up the thought of the sender, or some\none outside those rooms.\" She's a feeling this picture is connected\nwith some one passed over, and that it would be a portrait. She\npicked that thought up pretty strongly. She pretty sure about this.\nIn this case, the idea that some one was going to send a portrait\nto the Society may have been picked up at my flat on Sunday. Dora\nconfidently hopes she is giving information before it is known at the\nSociety.\nLater in the sitting, she again referred to it :\n\" I'm very interested in that picture,\" she says, Mr Bill. She\nfeels that that is, or should be, a good piece of evidence.\nAt the same sitting {January 19, 1937), Feda said :\nAnybody been falling there? Will you ask has any one fallen\nthere, or been talking about a fall? Dora picked up the thought\nvery strongly of a fall. Rather a nasty fall, not just a little shp\nor stumble, but a nasty fall, something that might have been\nquite serious.\nAs neither Miss Horsell nor I knew anything about a fall, Mr\nIrving and I asked Tolhurst (the Society's caretaker) if he knew of\none, and he at once replied that Mrs Despard, our tenant's house-\nkeeper, had had a nasty fall down the top flight of stairs. In Mrs\nTolhurst's corroborative statement, she gives the time of the fall as\n\" about 7.30 in the evening a day or two ago \". Her statement is\n\f110 Isabel Newton [PAUT\ndated January 20. The accident occurred a few days before the\nsitting.\nThe impression immediately following the above refers also to an\naccident, but one which occurred a month before the sitting. This\nassociation of ideas (if not accidental) is interesting, as it suggests\nthat the association lies in the percipient's mind, not in that of either\nof the agents, as neither knew of the other's accident.\nFeda : Will you ask if any one has hurt their hand there, or been\nthinking about their hand : Not both hands, one. Ooo! as if\nthey'd hold it hke this, in the other hand (Feda illustrates : [here\nfollows a rough sketch of two hands, one supporting the other])\nand say, \" Oh, dear!\n\"\nMiss Horsell's contemporary note is as follows :\nOn December 19 I badly bruised my right-hand index finger when\nopening a french casement window. It ached considerably, and on\nmy way home by train, which took about \\\\ hours, I rested my\nright hand on my left with the index finger uppermost, as in the\nillustration, in order to ease it. I did this also at intervals later.\nOn April 27, 1937, an impression was given which suggests\nclairvoyance, the only case of the kind in the series. After repre-\nsenting Dora as being in the seance room in connection with the\nspecial book-test, Feda said :\nNo, Dora! I don't think that would be right! Not bricks! Oh\ndear! it can't be right, can it, Mr Bill? Any bricks there, bricks?\nGot such a strong feehng of bricks, or pieces of brick. Dora says,\n\" Of course, I know there's a wall there\u2014it isn't that! \" She says\n\" You see my point? I might say in this room I'm reminded of\nbricks. It isn't that.\" Lots of houses is made of marble! Dora\nsays, \"Never mind! Leave it as I've said it. I'm reminded of\nbricks, in this position, in rather a peculiar way. I'm sensing bricks\nin an important way.\" That's right, Mr Bill. \" Bricks.\"\nMy note is :\nIn the corner of the room are 4 pieces of red rubber sponge (5f\" x 3^\"\nX H\"), which look like bricks. Mr Herbert says he is not conscious\nof ever having thought that these sponges resembled bricks, until\nhe went into the seance room to verify the impression, when he\nimmediately saw the resemblance. I have no recollection of having\nnoticed the sponges, but I am in and out of the seance room and\nmust have seen them.\nFrom towards the end of June Miss Horsell was away on sick leave\nfor three months, and I took her place in the office. At Mr Irving's\n\f155] A Study of Certain Leonard Phenomeyia 111\nnext sitting, i.e. on Juhj 22, 1937, eight impressions were given, in\nseven of which I was the ostensible agent, and yet no knowledge of\na connection with \" Mrs Isabel \" was shown. I will quote one or\ntwo of these impressions. The first is interesting, as showing that\nan idea may be transferred from its original setting to a setting that\nis associated with it. To make the point clearer I will again read\nmy contemporary annotation first\n:\nSome time between July 6-14, 1937, 1 lost three keys on a ring, one\nof which was the front door key. The loss of the other two did not\nmatter, but that of the front door was inconvenient as Tolhurst\nhad to come up from the basement every time to let me in. I\nfelt that the keys were not really lost. I used the term tem-\nporarily lost \" both to myself when thinking of them and to\nTolhurst when speaking of them.\nAfter a few days I concluded I had left them in the seance room\nwhen Mr Herbert and I sealed it up on July 6 for the book-test\nexperiment. As the room was not to be opened until the end of\nthe month I had a new key made ; the bill for this is dated July 14.\nFeda said, at the sitting on July 22 :\nShe's sorry they've lost the key. The key of something been\nmissing lately ... It was only lost temporarily . . . but it was\nlost. This is important. It wasn't gone, it was mislaid. She\nsaid \" key \", but I've got a feeling, though she said \" key \", there\nare other keys connected or linked up with it in some way, and\nthe word keys \" was mentioned as well as \" key That's right.\nLater, during the same sitting, when \" sensing \" conditions in the\nseance room, Feda said :\n\" Why am I getting something about \" keys \" again here? \" Just\nput that down, Mr Bill. Have you got that about keys ? I'm making\nthat remark 'cos Dora asked me to.\nHere the idea that was transferred was a mistaken idea, because\nthe keys were not, in fact, in the seance room. They were found some\ndays later elsewhere.\nIn the next impression which I shall quote the percipient is credited\nwith a capacity to associate ideas derived from two different sources,\nand to be reminded, by this association, of an incident that had\noccurred in the office. The impression was given on Jidy 22, 1937,\nduring the part of the sitting when Dora was represented as trying to\nfind the test-book. Referring to a vaguely indicated book, Feda said :\nShe got a strange feeling of finance . . . Will you see if there are\nsums of money written on it, or printed on it, either on the outside,\nor just inside? She kept getting finance, mentions of money. 'Cos\n\f112 Isabel Newton [PABT\nthat reminds her of something she was going to get through, and\nshe's glad it does. Has there been in the Searchers' office something\nrather puzzhng about money, Mr Bill? About a sum of money :\nsomething that's puzzled them rather, something that has been\nvery difficult to explain, or account for, do you see? I think that's\nright, Mr Bill. She meant to say that among the first things she\nsaid about the Searchers, but she couldn't get it through without\nthe book. The law of association, we work on that a great deal.\nWe often have to give ourselves a clue by mentioning something\nthat opens the way.\nIt is a pity that the impression did not relate to something more\nstriking, for it may be supposed that small financial difficulties are\nof frequent occurrence in the office. But Miss Horsell, who has been\nin charge of the Society's office for a considerable number of years,\nsays that this is not so. She denies that the impression would apply,\nfor example, at the present time. She told me of one incident which\nshe thought it would have fitted, but this, she said, occurred \" three\nor four years ago \". It would appear, therefore, that something\npuzzling about a sum of money . . . that has been difficult to explain,\nor account for \" is not an everyday occurrence in the office.\nThe following is my contemporary note on the impression :\nOn July 12, 1937 [the sitting was held on July 22] I paid into our\nBanking account a cheque for \u00a33 3s. Od. which I had cashed from\nPetty Cash a day or two before for a member of the Society. I ex-\npected to be able to adjust the matter in a few days by receiving\ncash in the office for a subscription or pubhcations, but it happened\nthat nothing came in until about July 23 ; the note of final adjust-\nment in the paying-in book is dated July 24. In the meantime I was\nvery puzzled as to how to make the adjustment [before we closed\nfor the vacation on July 31].\nIn view of the coincidence in time, coupled with the infrequency\nof the incident, I think we may reasonably assume a connection\nwith Feda's reference. And this assumption is strengthened by the\nfact that the impression is the only one of the kind in the complete\ncollection.\nIt was not until December 1937 that Mr Herbert and I at-\ntempted to verify Feda's allusion to a book in which finance and\nsums of money were mentioned. It was merely a matter of routine,\nfor as no definite indication of the position of the book was given,\nand the probability of finding some reference to finance in a collec-\ntion of seventy books was great, a \" verification \" could be of no\nevidential value.\nAs it happened, the only reference we succeeded in finding was a\n12 pp. pamphlet consisting entirely of prices and code words for\n\f155] A Study of Certain Leonard Phenomena 113\ncabling. This pamphlet was inside the cover of a \" Catalogue of\nOptical and Scientific Instruments \", down the spine of which is\nprinted, in large black capitals, W. Watson (& Sons, Limited. When\nnoting the details, Mr Herbert seemed to remember that the name\nWatson had been mentioned in connection with a later attempt to\ndetect the test-book, and on looking through the record of the sitting\nheld on September 20, 1937 {i.e. the one next in succession to the\nsitting of July 20, when the reference to finance was made), we found\nthe following allusion :\nFeda : See if, on the outside of a book, there's a name hke Watts,\nor Watson ? This is all round the test-book.\nThis mention of this distinctive feature of the book containing the\npamphlet is interesting, but it is dilticult to estimate its significance.\nWe may surmise that on the first occasion Feda's account was im-\nperfect, or that Dora's perception of the book was only partial, and\nthat on the second occasion the omission was rectified. But there is\nno evidence of a connection between the two allusions.\nFeda's statement that the book bearing the name Watson was\nnear the test-book was incorrect.\nMr Herbert's subliminal mind may be the source of the Watson\nimpression. It was he who selected the books and placed them in\nthe seance room. He may have retained a memory subliminally of\nthe pamphlet inside the Watson catalogue, and associated it sul)-\nlimmally with the reference to finance and prices. He did not know,\nhowever, of the incident in the ofiice which was said to be associated\nwith the idea of finance.\nI will conclude this series of examples of the Searchers \" im-\npressions with one which also suggests a subliminal derivation. It\nwas given suddenly during the sitting on Jidy 22, 1937, with\nreference to the seance room.\nFeda said with apparent irrelevance :\nLook! You would say that was in the city, in the town! But, she\nsays, has there been any vines there? Such a strong feehng of\nvines, as if vines once growing there. Will you find out. Dora\nsays, \" As well as providing evidence, I do like to find out why I\nget a thing, especially an extraordinary thing like that. Oh, that\ncame so strongly about the vines, so strongly, as if vines had once\nbeen a feature of this place. Isn't it strange!\n\"\nMy contemporary note is as follows :\nI had a very strong feeling when I read this extract that there used\nto be a hop plant growing where the seance room is now. I do\nnot know how we can find out whether my impression is correct.\n\f114 Isabel Newton [PAET\nMiss Horsell was the only likely person to know, as she was with\nthe Society when the seance room was built in 1923. She, however,\nhad no recollection of the matter, and finding that niy impression\nwas growing more and more micertain, I went, on December 21,\n1937, to Balham, and called on Miss Davis, who had lived for a long\ntime in the house as housekeeper to the previous tenant. Sir Ernest\nOlarke. She remembered the hop plant. She referred to it as \" a\nbig hop tree. They cut it down, when they built the new room.\"\nShe told me that I had shown her the room one day when she called\nat the house after Sir Ernest Clarke's death, and that she noticed\nthat the \" hop tree \" was gone. This must have been at least ten\nor twelve years ago. It will be noted that my knowledge concerning\nthe hop tree was, at the time of the sitting, subconscious.\nI will now pass on to the \" Isabel \" series. At this point it may be\nuseful to state the extent of my acquaintance with Mrs Leonard.\nI have never had a sitting with her. I have been present at two\nsittings as note-taker : in 1918 and 1924. Apart from these two\noccasions, I do not think I have met Mrs Leonard to speak to more\nthan three or four times. The last time was in 1932. I have never\ndiscussed her mediumship with her, nor intimated to her that any\none of her communicators was interested in the Society or in me.\nThe persons with whom the \" Isabel \" impressions are chiefly con-\ncerned are not interested in psychical research, and are not associated\nwith Mrs Leonard nor with Mr Irving. I am not aware ofany channel\nby which information regarding my personal affairs could normally\nhave reached them.\nThe first impression\u2014the thirty-third of the entire series\u2014was\ngiven at Mrs Allison's sitting on June 11, 1924. As it is included in\nMrs Salter's paper, I will not quote it here. At a sitting in Septem-\nber the same year Feda was asked by Mr Irving to visit my flat, and\nat a sitting two days later she claimed to have done this and to\nhave picked up certain impressions. These are also included in\nMrs Salter's paper. After that, occasional \" Isabel \" impressions\nwere given until 1926, when they became more and more frequent\n;\nduring the years 1928-1936 they completely outnumbered the\nSearchers references, as we have seen.\nIt will be easier to follow this part of my paper, I think, if I state\nat the outset that my examination of the \" Isabel \" impressions has\nled me to believe that they are \" of the stuff that dreams are made\nof \". I first suspected this when considering the following two very\ntrivial impressions which were given with others, but not consecu-\ntively, on January 24, 1935. Feda said :\n\f155] A Study of Certain Leonard Phenomena 115\n1. She thought Mrs Isabel had wanted a new cloth, a new cloth\nto cover the table. She didn't really want to cover the table . . .\nbut she thought she'd better . . .\n2. The name Fanny is connected with Mrs Isabel just now. Some-\nthing been happening in her conditions that's a hnk up with\nFanny and the past, thing of some time ago and the name Fanny.\nMy contemporary annotations are as follows :\n1. On the 21st of January when I was preparing for afternoon tea\nfor a visitor, I found that my small stock of tea cloths were shabby\nand soiled, and it passed through my mind that I would put no\ncloth on the table. However, disapproving of the appearance of\nthe tray on the bare table, I put a cloth on, after all.\n2. I know only one Fanny, Miss Fanny Lea, who lived some years\nago in the house where I still hve. I met Miss Lea in the Plane\nTree Eestaurant on January 21 when buying cakes for my visitor.\n(See above), and we both exclaimed how long ago it was since\nwe had met . . .\nIt puzzled me why two such very trivial incidents as these should\nhave been perceived. There was an interval of about an hour and a\nhalf between my laying the cloth and my meeting with. Miss Lea.\nDuring that time I had lunched with a friend, and we had had an\ninteresting conversation, yet no idea associated with it had been\npicked up.\nIt will be noted that the two incidents, though separated in time,\nwere connected with one subject, namely, preparations for a visitor.\nThe visitor was one of two people who were passing through a very\nemotional experience, with which I had been closely associated dur-\ning the preceding three months. These incidents, it seemed to me,\nwere on the fringe of my reactions to all this emotion : a point of\ningress to a preoccupation ^ in my mind.\nHere is another trivial impression :\nSeptember 23, 1926. Dora's reminded me of something that has\ngot to do with Mrs Isabel . . . Will you ask her if she was . . .\ndressing something up, like you might dress a doll up, dressing,\ndressing something up ? Dora got this as well as Feda . . .\nOn August 7 [a few weeks before the sitting] I went on a cruise\nwith a girl whom I will here call A. The cruise was a great dis-\nappointment to A. ; in fact, several things happened which caused\nher rather acute mental suffering. Towards the end of the cruise a\nFancy Dress Dance was arranged and I persuaded A., who by this\ntime had become averse to taking part in any festivities, to let me\n^ I use the term preoccupation in the sense of something that permanently\noccupies a field of interest at an unconscious, or preconscious, level.\n\f116 Isabel Newton [part\ndress her up. Two other girls and two children asked me to dress\nthem too, so that I was busy all day rigging up things for the\nevening. (I may say that this is my only experience of the kind.)\nNow, my most vivid memory of that occasion is of A., when the\nsupper gong sounded, asking me not to leave her. She and I were\nsitting alone on the deck until two of our fellow-cruisers joined us,\nand I slipped away under cover of their presence, to pick up in A.'s\ncabin and to throw into the sea every vestige of material connected\nwith her fancy dress. In short, the occasion of the dressing-up was\na culminating episode in a series of emotional upsets for A., and of\nmy reactions to them. Here again, it seems to me, there is a point\nof ingress to a preoccupation in my mind.\nThere are several impressions which I suspect are connected\nfundamentally with a long-standing preoccupation with the affairs\nof someone whom I will call M., a relative of mine who, in my\nopinion, has never had a fair chance in life. Here is an example of\nan apparently indirect connection :\nJanuary 27, 1931 . . . Ask Mrs Isabel has she been wanting some-\nthing, well, rather out of the ordinary to wear, and has she been\nthinking of it in this room ? [My sitting room] I got the feeUng of\n\u2014\n\" I know ... it sounds most unlikely, a print dress.\" (Here the\ndirect voice said winter.) She says, \" I know it's the winter ... I\nknow no one would buy or plan for a print dress now, yet that is\nwhat I got.\"\nFeda continued :\nAlso has she been tliinking of a piece of glass? Not a looking-glass,\nnot quite a complete thing in itself, not an ordinary thing. I felt\nthat I must call it a piece of glass, because it would represent only\na part of the entire article.\"\nMy contemporary notes are :\nIn the summer I bought from an art shop in Burford a gay and\nstriking gardening apron. In December I bought several pieces\nof printed cotton cretonne to make similar aprons, and I made\nseveral of these for Christmas presents during the week or two\nbefore Christmas.\nI cannot think of anything in connection with the second impression\nexcept one thing, which occurred however six or seven months\nbefore the sitting. I wanted a piece of bevelled plate glass for the\nwall behind a washstand in M.'s cottage. I took the measurements,\nand made several enquiries in London for such an article. Finally,\nI gave up the idea, on account of the expense of getting it to the\nsmall village in the Cotswolds where M. lives.\nThe description :\n\" not a looking-glass, not quite a complete thing\n\f155] A Study of Certain Leonard Phenomena 117\nin itself, not an ordinary thing (it would have to have been made)\na piece of glass representing only a part of the entire article \" is\ntrue of what I had in mind.\nIn these two impressions, which were given consecutively, there\nis an association of ideas such as we get in dreams. I was making\nthe print into aprons like one I bought at Burford, when I was stay-\ning at M.'s cottage, for which I wanted a piece of glass. The con-\ntemporary notes show a correspondence in time between the asso-\nciated incidents.\nMany of the impressions suggest this dream-like association of\nideas. Here is one connected with dressmaking, which is apparently\nanother of my preoccupations, of which I shall have something to\nsay later.\nJtdy 21, 1932. Dora felt Mrs Isabel holding something in her\nhands, strips, narrow strips of rather fine, soft material, narrow\nstrips. As if she was mentally measuring it. Stuff seemed to be\nfolded in a rather pecuhar manner. Wait, Dora, I know what\nyou're going to say. \" Or else she held it in this way.\" Look, Mr\nBill! It wasn't rolled round (Feda illustrates winding something,\nas if cotton round a reel) but it seemed to be folded hke in long\nloops and Mrs Isabel, look! was holding these loops, pulhng them\nout in her hands (Feda first illustrates throwing something upwards\nin loops, and then pulling something outward from her hands).\nVery soft, Dora thinks, narrow. Something between J in. and\n1 inch wid-e . . . And then she seemed to be thinking of some\nblack embroidery. Dora says, \" I call it embroidery, I don't know\nwhat else to call it . . . fine again, patterned, patterned, patterned.\"\nMy contemporary note is :\nAt about 6.30 p.m. on the day before Mr Irving's sitting I machined\nthe hem of a long narrow strip of dark blue silk marocain, 2i in.\nwide, 8^ yards long. When Mr Irving read the extract to me he\nmade certain movements illustrating Feda's, and I recognised them\nas resembhng my own movements when machining this strip.\nHanging from the machine to the floor it had got twisted, and at\nintervals of about three-quarters of a yard I tossed it up to get a\nstraight piece, which I then held out before me while machining it.\nI mentally divided it into eights, quarters and so on, as I went\nalong . . . The upper part and the sleeves of the dress for which\nthe strip was intended is made of fine patterned material ... I may\nadd that the machined strip was in my attache case at the S.P.R.\nwhen Mr Irving was reading the extract, and I thereupon showed\nit to him and to his sister.\"\nImmediately following the above impression was this one\n\f118 Isabel Newton [part\nMrs Isabel was also thinking about how dangerous it was of . . .\nsomething she wore on her neck coming undone. It has come\nundone two or three times. Dora thought \" She'll lose it if she\ndoesn't have something done to it \" . . . Dora gives me letter L\nconnected with it. I got a feehng that L may be more to do with\nthe place that the jewel came from . . .\nIn my contemporary note I say : that the knotted cord of a neck-\nlace of imitation old ivory beads had broken about a fortnight\nor so before the sitting, that I had then worn it with the ends\nloosely tied together, and on two occasions when out of doors I\nhad found they had come undone and I thought I should lose it if\nI did not get it properly restrung. I had bought it at Liberty's.\nIt was one of two necklaces only that I had bought at Liberty's.\nThe other one I bought to wear with the dress referred to in the\nprevious impression. The dress was made for a special occasion a\nyear before (the machined strip was for a pleating to lengthen it)\nand I had then a good deal of trouble to find a necklace that would\ntone with it before I saw^ the one at Liberty's.\nThe next impression is one in which two single ideas are connected\nwithout perception of any associative link.\nApril 30, 1931. [Dora was represented as taking a book-test from\na certain bookcase in my sitting room.]\nFeda : Anything Dutch here, Dutch, something Dutch? Got such\na strong feeling of Dutch. Yes, wasn't very interested in it, but\njust got the thought of it as she was standing there. Must be\nsomething there, she thinks. How funny! She says, \" Of course,\nit sounds ridiculous, as I stood there two thoughts came to me,\nseemed far apart, both mundane. Tennis, tennis. Wonder if\nthere's anything connected with tennis put there, where I'm\nstanding by these books.\" She says, \" Just ask about that.\"\nVery puzzled ! Looked round ! Something there, felt sure something\nthere, connected with tennis. Something Dutch there, and some-\nthing connected with playing tennis close there ...\nThis is my contemporary note :\nStanding on the top of the bookcase ... is a small colour print\nreproduction of a Dutch picture which was bought at the Exhibition\nof Dutch Pictures in London in 1929. Until July 1930 a large\nframed photograph of my niece was propped against the wall by\nthe side of this Dutch picture. In July it was moved to the other\nend of the bookcase near the window, where it has remained ever\nsince. The only suggestion of tennis in my flat is my association\nof tennis with this niece. She is a champion player and has won\nmany tournaments, and during the tennis season I have every\nsummer followed her progress in the reports of tournaments in\n\f155] A Study of Certain Leonard Phenomena 119\n\" The Times \". She was in the Wimbledon Tournament one year.\nI have no other interest in tennis.\nI omitted to state in the above note that my niece was wearing\nevening dress in the photograph ; there was, therefore, no suggestion\nof tennis in it.\nThe Dutch picture was given to me by Miss Dutton of Sidmouth.\nMy niece played in the tournaments at Frinton, Budleigh Salterton,\nand Sidmouth. I had never been to Frinton, nor to Budleigh\nSalterton, but I had stayed several times at Sidmouth with Miss\nDutton, and I had seen the tennis courts there. I had also remarked\nto Miss Dutton that I was sorry she was always away in August when\nEdna was in Sidmouth for the tournament. In my mind there was\nan association between the Dutch picture and playing tennis,\nalthough at the time I did not recognise it.\nThe next two impressions appear to be precognitive. They were\ngiven at Mrs Allison's sitting on Monday afternoon, June 7, 1926,\nand are associated with unimportant activities of mine during the\nfollowing day. The scene is again M.'s cottage. She was then living\nnear Lynton.\nIn the contemporary note to the first of the four impressions given\nat this sitting I explain that for certain reasons connected with some\nspecial work in the office, it would be inconvenient for me to take\nthe whole of my holiday in August as usual, and that the best\narrangement seemed to be that I should take one week from June\n8, and the rest later. I also state that this arrangement was not made\nuntil June 2. It will be understood from this that my being away\nfrom London at that particular time was unusual. The sitter,\nhowever, knew that I was away.\nAt a sitting at which Professor Hyslop was purporting to com-\nmunicate, on Monday afternoon, June 7, 1926, Feda said :\nHe has seen her lately in a small and pretty garden not as big as\nGladys's, and she was standing at the side of a path and some\nplants, she was looking at some plants . . . that were blown down,\nbeaten down with rain instead of standing straight, that were lying\nflat, and she was standing looking at them.\nFeda continued :\nAsk her if she wanted some nails recently. He's laughing. Nails.\nShe was wanting them for a special purpose. Wishing she got some\nnails. I think all this happened quite lately, that's why he's\ngiving it.\nMy contemporary annotations are as follows (I will reverse the\norder of them) ;\nH\n\f120 Isabel Newton [part\nI rarely want nails. At the time of the sitting I had not used any\nfor a long time\u2014in fact, I cannot remember when I wanted any\nbefore Tuesday, the day after the sitting. On Tuesday morning,\nwith the help of a man I put up a summer house, which had been\ndelivered that morning in sections at M.'s cottage. A packet of\nscrews, bolts and very long nails had also been sent. Before we\nhad finished I wanted some short nails.\nIn M.'s confirmatory note she says the summer-house was delivered\nabout 10 a.m. on Tuesday and that I began to put it up soon after ;\nand that between 2. .30-3. 30 I went in and collected all the nails\nshe had. Also, that I wanted more nails, and on the Friday after-\nnoon, June 11, we went into Lynton, and I went off and bought\nnails and joined her later.\nWith regard to the impression of the garden and of my looking\ndown at plants beaten down by rain : at the time of the sitting it\nhad not rained. There had been a spell of fine weather, which did\nnot break until 6 p.m. on Tuesday, and during the rest of the week\nthere was a good deal of heavy rain. On Tuesday afternoon I had\nmade a bed each side of the new summer-house and transplanted\nthere some ferns, fuchsias, and rose trees, and several times during\nthe evening and the next day or two I went out after heavy rain\npurposely to see if the plants had suffered. I never found them\nlying flat.\nDuring the week-end preceding Mr Irving's most recent sitting,\non January 18, 1938, I was examining the material for this paper,\nand I carefully considered the impression concerning my wanting\nnails. I considered its evidential value, from (a) the frequency of\nthe references to nails in the entire collection, and (6) the frequency\nof my need for nails. As to (a), I found two previous references to\nnails (they are both in the eliminated eases and were unrecognised).\nAs to (6), I thought :\n\" When have I wanted nails before, or since?\nI never use them. I don't put up shelves, nor make boxes, nor\nhammer nails in anything. I never want nails, except now and then\na tintack to hang up a Calendar.\"\nAt Mr. Irving's sitting a few days later, Feda said :\n\" Will you please ask Mrs Isabel if she was sorry, quite recently,\nshe wasn't a carpenter.\"\nAnd later in the sitting :\n\" Dead violets. Ask Mrs Isabel if she's been thinking of some\ndead violets lately? Or have there been some dead violets round\nher? She says '\nDead ones '. She forgot about that. She ought\nnot to have brought it in here, but she forgot to mention it.\"\n\f155] A Study of Certain Leonard Phenomena 121\nI had considered, the \" violet \" impression (included in the\nSearchers series) at the same time as the one referring to the nails.\nThey were associated in my mind as the only impressions that\nseemed to be precognitive. The percipient indicates that the latter\nimpression was omitted at some previous point in the sitting. She\nhad forgotten to mention it\n\u2014probably when she referred to my not\nbeing a carpenter.\nI suspect that \" dead violets \" is a dream-like merging of two\ncases into one. I had selected an impression concerning deadflowers\nfor quotation in the vSearchers series, before I noticed that it belonged\nto the eliminated group. Both the \" violet \" and the \" dead flowers\n\"\nimpressions were associated with Mr Dingwall.\nIn the autumn of 1932 my preoccupation with M.'s affairs became\nmore concentrated, as in 1931 she had lost more than half of her\nsmall means and it had become necessary for her and the friend\nwith whom she lives to do something to increase their income.\nThis was not possible in the small village in the Cotswolds where\nthey were living and they took steps to find a more suitable place.\nAn appropriate reference to their situation, which I will not quote,\nwas made at Mr Irving's sitting on April 30, 1931, about three months\nafter M.'s loss of income.\nAlthough they were in touch with house agents in different parts\nof the countrv, M. and her friend could hear of nothing suitable and\nby the autumn of 1932, when the lease of the cottage was nearing its\ntermination, they lost their nerve. It seemed as if all the small\nproperties had been snapped up during the financial depression of\n1932.\nAt a sitting on September 22, 1932, Feda said :\nWill you ask Mrs Isabel whether she's been thinking, quite lately,\nhke the last day or two, about helping some people to make a move?\n\" I don't think she was making the move herself,\" Dora says,\n\" but 1 do think that she\"s been helping some one that she's very\ninterested in to make one, or to commence making one.\"\nMy contemporary note runs :\nThis is true. A few days before the sitting I began definitely to\ntake steps to help M. and the friend with whom she lives to find a\nsuitable place and a suitable house to remove to.\nAbout the middle of November (that is, about eight weeks later)\nM. and I bought a small plot of land in a place in Dorset which she\nthought would be suitable for her purpose, and we engaged a builder\nto put up a small house. The negotiations and arrangements were\nin my hands.\nH 2\n\f122 Isabel Newton [part\nTwo months later, at the sitting on January 26, 1933, Feda said :\nYou ask her if she had a long envelope? She took out from the\nenvelope what Dora would call a wad, a wad of papers, wad. And\nkept unfolding first one and then another. Dora thinks the papers\nwere not all of one colour, not all white, not all the same size.\nAnd she seemed to be separating them, spreading them out. Look,\nMr Bill! with her hands hke that. (Feda illustrates smoothing\nsomething on a table with her hands wide open, palms underneath.)\nAs if she wanted to get them flat, she thought. There was some-\nthing important that Mrs Isabel had to think out with regard to\nfigures or numbers, in connection with them.\nMy contemporary note is :\nThis is correct. During the evening of January 25 {i.e. the evening\nbefore the sitting) I took from a long envelope a roll of letters and\npapers relating to a family business [the building of the house].\nI laid each one flat on the table, putting them first in chronological\norder, and then selecting those that I should want on the following\nday. When Mr Irving read the extract I recognised the reference\nbut denied that there were any but white papers. When I went\nhome, however, and looked again at the papers in the envelope, I\nfound an orange-coloured circular and a yellow one (time tables\nof day excursions and bus routes in connection with the business\nmatter).\nThe papers were specifications and letters relating to the building\nof the house. I was going the next day to Dorset to meet the builder,\nwho had written a few days previously to ask me for instructions\nregarding the roof, whether it was to be tiled or slated.\nThe impression immediately following the above reflects the\nopinion of one or two friends who knew of the house-building\nproject ; an opinion I probably accepted though repudiating it to\nmyself.\nShe's neglecting something, Mrs Isabel is, that has a bearing on\nherself . . . she's neglecting her own interests, with regard to some-\nbody and a place rather a long way off . . . There's a name\nbeginning with a G connected with this condition. And a second\nname that would seem to begin with a C, Dora thinks a hard C.\nMy annotation seems to reflect some annoyance :\n. . . The statement in the notes is too vague to identify definitely.\nI do not know to what G refers, nor the rest of the extract.\nIn the light of dream association I now suggest that the hard C\nmight refer to the Cotswolds, and the G to Gloucester. Gloucester\nwas a necessary part of the address of M.'s cottage.\n\f155] A Study of Certain Leonard Phenomena 123\nFeda : Would you see roofs from this room? Don't think that's\nright, Dora. \" Well,\" Dora says, \" Mrs Isabel has been thinking\nvery much about roofs.\" Dora isn't sure whether you see roofs\nfrom the window of this room, or whether Mrs Isabel has been\nmentally visualising roofs in this room [i.e. my sitting room, where\nI had spread out the papers taken from the long envelope].\nMy note is :\nFor some days and especially the day of the sitting my mind was\noccupied with the question of roof materials. Miss Horsell, who\nknows the circumstances, can corroborate.\nAfter receiving the builder's letter a few days before the sitting,\nasking for instructions in regard to the roof of the new house, I went\nto the Building Centre, in New Bond Street, and saw many kinds of\ntiles and made enquiries as to their durability and price.\nThe next reference to M.'s affairs was given three months later, at\na sitting on April 25, 1933. Shortly before this date something had\noccurred which made me think that the house project was a mistake,\nand I had lost heart for the time being. I was convalescing in a\nfurnished cottage on the Quantock Hills after a serious illness, and\nthe greater part of my time was spent in my bedroom there. The\nimpression showed concern for my condition of mind, and a certain\ndiscrimination in relation to the sense of defeat I was experiencing,\nwhich was rather impressive. I will not read this impression ; I\nmention it, as there is an interesting point in connection with it, to\nwhich I will refer later.\nIn the last week of July 1933, M. and her friend moved into the new\nhouse, which has proved a completely successful venture.\nThere was no further reference to my preoccupation with this\nmatter until a year later, when on July 26, 1934, an indirect reference\nwas made to the financial side of it, which I will not quote.\nThe final reference was given on January 24, 1935, when Feda said :\nIs this a joke? I think it must be, it doesn't sound right. \" We\ncan't put our hands in a lucky bag and draw out the right number.\"\nOh! it's an answer to a question. I think I got it right, Mr Bill.\nIt's an answer to a question. \" We can't put our hands in a lucky\nbag and pick out the right number.\" It sounds awful mixed up.\nShe says, \" I want it just in those words. In other words, we do\nnot help people in games of chance, or anything of that kind . . .\nIt's one for Mrs Isabel.\nMy contemporary note is as follows :\nStill owing money on M.'s house . . . and having a cousin who\nwon about \u00a350 by correctly solving a cross-word puzzle in a com-\n\f124 Isabel Newton [PABT\npetition, I have tried to hurry on the payment of my debt by taking\npart in the same weekly competition. No skill is required : it is\npurely a matter of chance, the clues being simple but presenting\na choice of alternatives, to which there is no clue to the one intended.\nIt has occurred to me more than once that it would be nice if Dora\nand Feda, who say on many occasions that they are helping me,\nwould guide me to the right choice in the matter of the alternatives.\nWe have seen that in the Searchers series the thoughts were picked\nup in the house, and I have assumed that in the \" Isabel \" series\nthey have been picked up in my flat, W'hich Dora and Feda profess\nto have visited. The impression expressing concern at my having\nlost heart about M.'s affairs was picked up in the cottage on the\nQuantock Hills, for I had been living there since the beginning of\nApril 1933 and the impression was given on April 25, 1933. There\nwere two other impressions given with it, both of them associated\nwith the same room, my bedroom. I will quote one of them :\nFeda : The fireplace in this room is said to be in an inconvenient\nposition. The fireplace has been grumbled about. \" Great pity\nit was there. Ought to be in another position.\" I feel quite near\nthe fireplace . . . there's no room to put something that they\nwant to put in between . . . this is connected with Mrs Isabel, a\nroom of Mrs Isabel's. I want to say something. You know, Dora's\ntaken me to Mrs Isabel's before. I don't know if she's changed\nanything, but it feels different. When I said that Dora nodded\nher head, and she said, \" Yes, there's a reason for you feeling hke\nthat, Feda, though I cannot explain.\"\nIn my annotation I say ;\nI have never thought that the fireplace in either room in my flat\nwas in an inconvenient position.\nThen, referring to my room in the cottage on the Quantocks, I\nsay :\nThe fireplace was so inconveniently placed that it was impossible\nto pass between it and the foot of the bed comfortably ; in fact,\nthe position of the fireplace was a bar to every suggestion my\nsister made for a more convenient arrangement of the furniture.\nThere is an indication in this impression that both Feda and Dora\ndetected a difference in my environment but could not explain it.\nIt is difficult to imagine the process by which these impressions,\npicked up in a bedroom in a cottage on the Quantock Hills, were\nperceived. Neither Mr Irving nor Mrs Leonard knew where I was\nat the time.\nWith the exception of those recorded in this paper and a few\n\f155] A Study of Certain Leonard Phenomena 125\nrelating to holidays, the impressions contain no allusions to the\nvaried interests and pleasures which make up the routine of life.\nThis omission suggests that, for the purposes of the percipient, my\nthoughts relating to these every-day matters, no matter how\nabsorbing they were for me at the time, fell upon stony places,\nwhere they had not much earth, and because they had no root they\nwithered away. But some of the thoughts which related to holidays\napparently fell upon good ground, for there are no less than ten\nsuch impressions. And holidays do mean, for me, an idea which\ngoes deep into the mental soil. They are not merely transient\nperiods of change. They are an escape from a feeling which I could\ncompare to that of a donkey tethered to one patch on a wide\ncommon ; and I know the strength of this feeling to be rooted in a\ncomplex that goes far back into my early years.\nI have by no means exhausted the analogies between dream forma-\ntion and these impressions, but time is running on and before con-\ncluding I should like to mention one problem, and the solution of it\nthat my subconscious mind has suggested. There are, in the\nimpressions, more references to my dressmaking than to any other\nsubject. I pondered over this, for it seemed to me that my dress-\nmaking had no real significance for me, although there was a certain\npretence emotion associated with it. I was thinking how I exag-\ngerated this pretence emotion for the amusement of my friends.\nFirst, there is the hope and confidence of a perfect creation ; then\nthe successful achievement of preparation ; then the trying-on and\nthe realisation of w^hat an object I look! and the throwing of the\nthing aside ; and finally the taking of it up and doggedly making\nthe best of it. While I was reviewing this range of mock emotion\nthere shpped into my mind, in the way the \" direct voice \" slips\ninto Mrs Leonard's trance utterances, the word frustration \".\nIt was startling, for I had never had an experience of this kind\nbefore. Thinking it over. I concluded that the idea of frustration\nmust be a Freudian symbol, for to associate it directly with my\ndressmaking seemed to be giving the latter too much significance.\nI dismissed the matter from my mind.\nIn the morning when I awoke, I found myself thinking of a day\nlong ago when I stood on the sea-shore watching the sea come\nbounding joyously in, and recede with a hopeless, sighing sound over\nthe shingle. Again the word \" frustration \" slipped into my mind,\nand in a flash I remembered my experience of the evening before\nand understood its meaning. On the occasion long ago when I\nwatched the sea so joyously bounding in and so sighingly receding\nI had identified myself with it, and had quoted to myself the words\n\f126 Isabel Newton [part\nof Goethe, to the effect that \" happiest they who soonest find the\ngulf that lies between their aspirations and their powers \".\nI do not know how much reliance one can place on a subconscious\npromptmg of tliis kind, but my dressmaking emotions do certainly\nseem to me to be, in more ways than one, a kind of parody of the\nstormy years of my girlhood. Even the laughter behind them has\nits significance. I have mentioned the incident, which is unique in\nmy experience, as having possibly a bearing on the nature of the\nimpressions in the Isabel \" series.\nIn this paper I have tried to show that however trivial the\nimpressions may be, they have a particular significance for me. I\nsuggest that the selection of ideas, haphazard as it may seem, is in\nfact correlated with this and that system of ideas, and still more of\nfeelings, in my own mind ; and that if the imjoressions were ade-\nquately analysed there would be found an underlying unity.\nIn other words, the impressions may be likened to the leaves\nwhich are seen on the surface of some ponds, apparently floating and\ndisconnected but in reality connected, each one, with a root, which\nwith other roots form a unity of underlying vegetation. Some of the\nroots throw up many stems ; the M. impressions may serve as an\nillustration of an analogy in this respect. Some stems throw out\nshoots near the surface ; the associated impressions, of which I have\nquoted some examples, may be likened to these. I have said \" near\nthe surface \", for these associations are self-evident to me, and they\nare given either consecutively or as part of the series given at any\none sitting, as if the association of ideas is perceived.\nBelow the surface are the interlacing stems, and the roots from\nwhich they have their common origin. The leaves float separately,\napparently disconnected, upon the surface, clearly visible ; the\nstems, lightly silted over with the mud of the pond, are scarcely\nseen and soon disappear from sight ; the roots are invisible. The\nimage may be faulty, but it suggests the feeling that I have when I\ncome to think over these cases, that details apparently disconnected\nand trivial in the \" Isabel \" series are in fact organically connected\nwith systems of feeling which have become organised in my own\nmind ; and I think I have shown that the groupings in which these\nimpressions have actually occurred suggest that this idea of con-\nnection and structure does not spring from my mind alone.\nBut the evidence I have put forward rests on my word only, and\ntherefore any theory it may suggest can have no weight unless it is\nconiirmed by independent observation. I have put it forward in the\nhope that similar phenomena will be examined, whenever possible,\nwith a view to testing this tentative hypothesis.\n\f155] Review 127\nREVIEW\nG. N. M. Tyrrell. Science and Psychical Phenomena. Methuen.\nXV + 374 pp.\nIt is a long time since there has appeared so comprehensive and\nwell-ordered a survey of psychical research as Mr Tyrrell gives us.\nPsychical research, as he points out in his Introduction, is a branch\nof psychology which \" has thrust out a spear-head into the un-\nknown between normal psychology, on the one hand, whose business\nit is to deal with the mind in relation to the affairs of ordinary life,\nand abnormal psychology, on the other, which deals with the mind\nin derangement and disease\nThe book is divided into five parts, the first of which is devoted to\nspontaneous extra-sensory perception. In assigning pride of place\nto the spontaneous mental phenomena Mr Tyrrell does well. Much\nof the best work of the S.P.R. in its earlier days was devoted to\ntheir study, and PJiantasms of the Living and the Report on the\nCensus of Hallucinations {Proceedings, Vol. X), which were the fruit of\nthese labours, are still pre-eminent in psychical literature. Fashions\nchange in psychical research as in everything else, and for several\nyears past attention has been turned to other lines of enquiry. But\nthere is no other branch of psychical research which affords a better\ntraining in applying critical standards or better opportunities for\nwatching supernormal faculties at work. This is because of the great\nquantity of separate cases available for study, no two of them exactly\nalike but each of them embodying some notable experience of per-\nsons who, apart from these unusual and often, to them, unique\nexperiences, are indistinguishable from the neighbours we meet\nevery day. Evidence thus derived has certain values of its own, and\nalthough more striking material is to be met, e.g. in the records of the\nfew great mediums, no survey of supernormal powers would be\nadequate which neglected the spontaneous phenomena or left them\nin the background.\nAfter a useful discussion of the nature of spontaneous evidence,\nand of the problem of chance-coincidence as a possible explanation\nof veridical dreams and hallucinations, Mr Tyrrell gives several well-\nchosen cases from the S.P.R. Proceedings and Journal of spon-\ntaneous telepathy, clairvoyance and precognition, concluding this\npart of the book with a brief discussion of \" psychometry \" or\nobject-reading.\n\f128 Review [PAET\nIn passing to Part II, which deals with experimental extra-\nsensory perception, Mr Tyrrell, were he less modest, might well say\n\" Quorum jyars magna fui \", for this is a subject to which his own\nexperiments have largely contributed. Before coming to more recent\ndevelopments he gives an interesting historical summary of experi-\nments carried out in different countries. Although Mr Tyrrell's\nown work has mainly been of a kind leading to statistical analysis,\nhe evidently realises the importance of the results obtained by other\ntypes of experiment. From these Mr Tyrrell passes to the recent\nexperiments in which Dr. Rhine and himself have played a leading\npart. It is clear that there are technical difficulties in the way of\nstatistical experiments in extra-sensory perception which will\nrequire further exploration, so that the conclusions of even so\nexperienced an investigator as Mr Tyrrell must at present be re-\ngarded as in a high degree provisional.\nIn Part III Mr Tyrrell sums up the conclusions of Parts I and II\nand discusses the theoretical aspects of extra-sensory perception and\ntheir relation to the problem of normal sense-perception. This\nsection should be of great help to many students who complain that\nin our Proceedings and Journal they find masses of facts and techni-\ncalities of detail without sufficient indications of co-ordinating\nprinciples.\nThe rest of the book is devoted to the mediumistic trance, one\nchapter being given to the physical phenomena. These are always\na problem to any writer attempting to give a general survey of\npsychical research. Their connection with the mental phenomena\nis, apart from the accidents of history, extremely slender, and even\ninter se they do not cohere to the same degree as the mental pheno-\nmena. If it were not that certain problems of evidence are common\nto both departments of psychical research, there would be a strong\ncase for making a clean cut between the two. As things are Mr\nTyrrell was probably wise in giving the physical phenomena a\nchapter, but no more, in his book. Separate chapters are given to\nMrs Piper, Mrs Leonard, the evaluation of chance in mediumistic\nmaterial, quantitative studies of the kind pursued by Mr Whately\nCarington, and book-tests. Mr Tyrrell achieves something of a\ntour de force in condensing an instructive account of cross-corre-\nspondence within the limits of a chapter.\nThen follow chapters on the modus operandi of the trance, and on\ntrance-personalities, with special reference to Lord Balfour's paper\non Mrs Willett {Proceedings, Vol. XLIII). Particular interest attaches\nto the chapter headed \" Nature of the Communicators : Antecedent\nProbability of Survival \", in which Mr Tyrrell states and criticises\n\f155] Review 129\nProf. Broad's \" Compound Theory \" as put forward in his The Mind\nand its Place in Nature. Mr. Tyrrell argues that neither alone, nor in\nconjunction with any hypothesis of telepathy between the Uving,\ndoes this theory explain all the facts, particiilarly those connected\nwith cross-correspondences : on this point I am in complete agree-\nment with him.\nThe concluding chapter has some very interesting comments on\nthe telepathic and survivalist interpretations of ostensibly spirit-\nistic material. As to the former Mr Tyrrell writes :\n\" The real drawback to the telepathic theory is that, in order to\nmake it work, we have to regard the living mind as something\ndifferent from and immensely wider than what we commonly mean\nby the term, and we have to endow it with such a range of '\nsub-\nliminal self ' and with such astonishing extra-sensory powers that\nthe proposition of its survival takes on a new aspect. Having\ngranted that the self is unlike the human unit of everyday experience\nas the telepathic theory demands, the arguments which hitherto\nseemed to make its survival improbable no longer apply, at least\nwith anything hke the same force. And so we find that the object\nwhich the telepathic theory was designed to fulfil, the object of\nproviding a '\nnormal '\nexplanation, is no longer achieved.\"\nAs regards the survivalist theory Mr Tyrrell points out that\npsychology, religion and everyday experience all recognise division\nwithin the self, particularly division into what he calls \" the domi-\nnant I \" and \" the synthetic or empirical I \", between which \" there\nis the possibility of disunion and strife without numerical discrete-\nness \". The ' empirical I \" is a \" specialised product \" adapted to\nthe common life of the world, and \" speaking broadly and generally,\nmost of the anti-survivalist arguments arise from the incongruity of\nimagining this special kind of personahty entering into other sur-\nroundings \". Mr Tyrrell suggests that the complex is resolved at\ndeath, without necessarily destruction in the process of \" the prin-\nciple of the dominant I \", which would then be free to enter into new\nand more stable forms of association. Mr Tyrrell's argument would\ngain strength from such examples of dissociation as the Beauchamp\nand Doris Fischer cases, which he too lightly dismisses, though\nadmittedly pathological dissociation such as these cases present is\nnot altogether parallel to the divisions within the normal self, which\nhe is discussing.\nThere is much that is attractive in this hypothesis, nor is it lacking\nin support from the evidence. But from the point of view of the\nstudent the difficulty remains that even the best \" communications\n\"\nostensibly come, and have all the appearance of coming, from a still\n\f130 Review [PAET 155\nunresolved complex with the \" empirical I \" well in the foreground.\nIt is doubtless possible to strain off the trivialities typical of the\n\" empirical I \", and to explain them by unconscious dramatisation\non the part of a mind (the medium's) endowed with extended\nfaculties of cognition. But the student has to do the work of separa-\ntion for himself, with whatever objectivity he can command, and\nwithout any internal indications in the material to guide him, other\nthan the greater or less degree of seriousness of the different parts.\nPossibly the process of resolving the complex is a long one, and\nmost of the communications recorded have been received before its\ncompletion.\nThere are points of detail which specialists in some branches of\npsychical research might wish to criticise, but in general this book\nmay be warmly welcomed as a much-needed, well-arranged, up-to-\ndate survey of our subject.\nW. H. Salter\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 156\nHENRY SIDGWICK AND PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nBy Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D.\nHenry Sidgwick, one of the founders and the first President of our\nSociety, was born on May 31, 1838. His centenary has recently been\ncelebrated by a memorial lecture at Leeds, in the neighbourhood of\nwhich city he was born, and at Cambridge, where he dwelled and\nworked throughout the greater part of his life. iVs the S.P.R. owes\nits existence and its present status of at least semi-respectability in\nscientific circles very largely to the courage, patience, wisdom, and\ngenerosity of Sidgwick, it is only fitting that the great services he\nrendered to it should be recalled at this time to our members. From\nthe nature of the case, most of Sidgwick's intimate friends and col-\nleagues are now dead or advanced in years. The present writer never\nknew Sidgwick personally and has had no access to unpublished\nsources of information about him. But he happens to have suc-\nceeded him, longo intervallo in every sense of the phrase, both as\nPresident of the S.P.R. and as Knightbridge Professor at Cambridge,\nand he finds Sidgwick's attitude both in philosophy and in psychical\nresearch pecuharly admirable and sympathetic. These seemed to\nhim to be adequate grounds for undertaking to write for the Pro-\nceedings an account of Sidgwick's relations with psychical research\nin general and the S.P.R. in particular.\nIt will be as well to begin with a very brief account of Sidgwick's\nlife. He was born at Skipton on May 31, 1838, being the third sou\nand fourth child of the Rev. William Sidgwick and Mary Crofts.\nHis paternal grandfather was a cotton-spinner at Skipton, and his\nuncles carried on the business. His father was educated at Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge, and entered the Church. He held various cures,\nI 131\n\f132 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [PAET\nand, at the time when Henry was born, he was headmaster of the\ngrammar-school at Skipton. He died in 1841, when Henry was three\nyears old, leaving his wife with a family of young children. After\na.ttending preparatory schools at Bristol and at Blackheath Sidgwick\nentered Rugby in 1852. His cousin, E. W. Benson, afterwards Arch-\nbishop of Canterbury, was then a young assistant master at Rugby.\nIn 1853 Sidgwick's mother moved to Rugby and he and Benson\nlived with her. His school career was happy and brilliant, and he\nmade several friendships which lasted throughout life. He entered\nTrinity College, Cambridge, in October 1855, where he studied mathe-\nmatics and classics. He was a respectable mathematician and a\nbrilliant classic. In 1856 he shared the second Bell Scholarship with\nJ. M. Wilson, in 1857 he won the Craven Scholarship, and in 1858\nhe shared the Browne's Prize for Greek and Latin Epigrams with\nO. 0. Trevelyan. In 1859 he was thirty-third wrangler in the mathe-\nmatical tripos and was placed first in the classical tripos. In the\nsame year he won the First Chancellor's Medal and crowned his\nacademic career by being elected to a fellowship at Trinity. The\nrest of his working life was spent at Cambridge.\nDuring the sixties Sidgwick was engaged in a desperate internal\nstruggle with the intellectual difficulties which the Christian religion,\nas then understood in England, presented to honest and instructed\nminds. In the course of these enquiries he gained a thorough\nmastery of Hebrew and Arabic, made an elaborate study of theology,\nand immersed himself in philosophy. At that time it was a con-\ndition of holding a fellowship that the holder should declare himself\nto be a \" bom, fide member of the Church of England \". This\nobligation was not usually taken very seriously, but Sidgwick was\nan exceptionally conscientious man. By June 1869 he had come to\nthe conclusion that he did not fulfil the condition literally enough\nto justify him in holding a paid office on these terms. He therefore\nresigned his fellowship and assistant tutorship at Trinity. The\ncollege accepted his resignation with deep regret and did what it\ncould to compensate him by creating a lectureship in Moral Science,\nwithout theological conditions, and appointing him to it. Never-\ntheless, Sidgwick suffered a considerable loss of income and amenities\nfor a number of years.\nIn 1875 Trinity appointed Sidgwick Praelector in Moral and\nPohtical Philosophy, which gave him an increased income and an\nassured position. In the same year he became engaged to Eleanor\nMUdred Balfour, whom he married in 1876. He and his future wife\nhad met while working at the two subjects which were destined to\noccupy most of their future time and energy, viz., psychical research\n\f156] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 133\nand the higher education of women at Cambridge. It should be\nunnecessary to remind members of the S.P.R. of the magnificent\nwork which Mrs. Sidgwick did for the Society and for the subject\nduring her long and active life. Anyone who will take the trouble\nto read the memoirs of Mrs Sidgwick by Miss Johnson, Mr Salter,\nand Mr Besterman, in Vol. XLIV, and will then refer back to the\nnumerous and masterly articles which she contributed to previous\nvolumes, will see that one of Sidgwick's most important services to\npsychical research was to encourage his wife to pursue the subject.\nBy 1880 the movement for the education of women at Cambridge\nTiad progressed so far that a new Hall of Residence at Newnham\nhad been built, and Sidgwick and Mrs Sidgwick temporarily moved\ninto it. In the following year Trinity made him an honorary fellow.\nHe had applied for the Knightbridge Professorship of Moral Philo-\nsophy on the death of F. D. Maurice in 1872, but another candidate\nhad rather unaccountably been chosen. The professorship again\nfell vacant in 1883, and this time Sidgwick was elected. He held\nthe chair until his last illness in the spring of 1900.\nThroughout his life Sidgwick had been an active participator in\n\"various attempts to reform the constitution of his own college and\nthe university. In 1876 Lord Salisbury set up a statutory com-\nmission for Oxford and Cambridge on the lines desired by the Cam-\nbridge liberals. The new statutes came into force in 1882, and\nSidgwick was much occupied during the next ten years in the delicate\nwork of initiating and trying to carry through certain financial and\neducational changes which they had made possible and which he\nthought desirable.\nIn 1892 Mrs Sidgwick accepted the Principalship of Newnham\n\u2022College on the death of Miss Clough. The building at Newnham\nwhich she was to occupy was completed at the end of 1893, and the\nSidgwicks then gave up their house in Cambridge and moved into\nI^ewnham College, where Sidgwick spent the last seven years of his\nlife. Early in 1900 he underwent a serious operation, from which he\nnever recovered. He died on August 28, 1900, at the house of his\nbrother-in-law, Lord Rayleigh, at Terling in Essex. He is buried\nin the churchyard of Terling.\nDuring the period which has been covered in this sketch of Sidg-\nwick's life he was busily engaged in his academic work in philosophy,\npolitical theory, and economics. The most important works which\nhe published in his lifetime were The Methods of Ethics, Outlines of\nthe History of Ethics for English Readers, The Principles of Political\nEconomy, and The Elements of Politics. After his death four sub-\nstantial books were made out of his lectures, viz., Philosophy, its\nI 2\n\f134 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [PABT\nScope and Relations, The Development of European Polity, Lectures\non the Ethics of Green, Spencer, and Martineau, and Lectures on the\nPhilosophy of Kant. He wrote numerous articles on literary, educa-\ncational, and other subjects, and a collection of these has been\npublished under the title of Miscellaneous Essays and Addresses.\nThe reader is now in possession of the main facts about Sidgwick's\nwork in other fields than that of psychical research. Let us now\nconsider the history of his activities in the latter field. His interest\nin ostensibly supernormal phenomena goes back to the beginnings\nof his undergraduate days. When he went up to Cambridge a society\ncalled the \" Ghost Society \" already existed there. One of the\nfounders of this had l)een his cousin, E. W. Benson. Westcott was\nsecretary of it until 1860, when he left Cambridge for Harrow.\nSidgwick joined the Ghost Society while he was still an under-\ngraduate.\nIt is plain from his letters that he was collecting stories of super-\nnormal phenomena in the late fifties and early sixties. In a letter\nto his sister of October 30, 1859, he refers to a ghost-story sent him\nby his mother, and to others which he had had from an Irish friend.\nIn another letter, later in the same term, he mentions a newspaper\ncutting, sent to him by his Uncle Eobert, narrating a dream of her\nson's death which a poor woman had on the night of the wreck of\nthe \" Royal Charter \". He makes the characteristically cautious\ncomment \" It was curious, but, considering how fruitful of dreams-\nsuch a night must be, not very strong evidence \"'.\nIn a letter to his\nmother in July 1860 he thanks her for a ghost-story and says that he\nhas had two very remarkable ones at first hand from a clergyman.\n\" Mind you shut up everybody who says that such stories can only\nbe got from '\ncousin's cousin's friends '\nor such like distant parties\n\"\"\nis the admonition which he gives to his mother at the end of the\nletter.\nIn 1860, whilst staying in London with his friend Cowell, he had\nhis first experience of a sitting with a professional medium for\nphysical phenomena. In a letter to his sister he describes the\nmedium as \" a complete humbug \". In 1864 he and Cowell had\nsittings together for automatic writing. Cowell produced the writing-\nand they were both puzzled by hearing unexplained raps, but they\nagreed that there was nothing in the contents of the scripts that\ncould not have come from their own minds. Many years afterwards,\nSidgwick gave an account of these sittings to F. W. H. Myers, which\nis printed in Myers's article on \" Automatic Writing \" in Vol. Ill\nof the Proceedings. Two points of interest emerged. One was the\ningenuity which the unconscious part of Cowell's mind displayed in\n\f156] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 135\npuzzling the conscious part of it. The other was the elaborate stories\nwhich would be developed in the automatic script to account for\nthe failures of the ostensible communicator to pass the tests which\nCowell and Sidgwick had devised in order to examine his claims to\nbe an independent entity.\nThe first period of Sidgwick's investigations into Spiritualism\nextends roughly from 1865 to 1875. In 1863 he writes to his friend\nDakyns \" I have not yet investigated Spiritualism, but I am still\nbent on doing so as soon as I get an opportunity \". He also mentions\nthat T. H. Green \" sniffed at \" it, as one might perhaps have ex-\npected. In writing to his mother early in 1864, in reference to a\nbook which she had recommended to him, he says \" I am pretty\nwell read in pneumatological literature, but I have not heard of the\nbook that you mention \". Later in the year he writes to Dakyns\nsaying \" As to Spiritualism I have not progressed, but am in painful\ndoubt. Still, I have some personal experiences and much testimony,\nand I find it hard to believe that I shall not discover some unknown\nlaws, psychological or other. ...\" Writing to Roden Noel in\nDecember 1866, he makes some interesting comments on the effects\nwhich his recent reading of Lecky's History of Rationalism has had\non him. The book had set him to consider the evidence for mediaeval\nmiracles, a topic which Lecky explicitly ignored. Sidgwick was con-\nsiderably impressed by this evidence, and he writes to Noel as\nfollows. \" I dimly foresee that I shall have to entirely alter my\nwhole view of the universe and admit the '\nmiraculous '\n... as a\npermanent element in human history and experience. ...\" He sug-\ngests that these reflexions link up with his interest in Spiritualism,\nand that together they may throw a light on the origin of all religions.\nIn the summer of 1867 Sidgwick was staying in London and he\nhad many experiences of spiritualistic phenomena. Some of them\nwere impressive, but he could never get absolutely satisfactory\nevidential conditions. During this period he happened to meet\nMazzini at a dinner party, and he was greatly interested by a story\nof a collective hallucination, due to mass-suggestion, which Mazzini\nrelated to him from his own experience. The case is described in a\nfootnote to Chapter XVIII of Phantasms of the Living (p. 477 of the\nabridged edition). It seems to be worth quoting. In or near some\nItalian town Mazzini saw a group of people standing gazing upwards\ninto the sky. He went up to one of them and asked him what he\nwas gazing at. The cross\u2014do you not see it\"?\n\" said the man,\npointing to the place where the cross was supposed to be. Mazzini\ncould see nothing in the least cruciform in the sky ;\nbut, on enquiring\nof others, he found that they also thought they were seeing a cross.\n\f136 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [PABT\nAt length Mazzini happened to notice one gazer who looked rather\nmore intelligent than the rest, and also seemed to have a faint air of\ndoubt and perplexity. Mazzini went up to him and asked him what\nhe was looking at. \" The cross\/\" he said, \" there.\" Mazzini took\nhold of his arm, gave him a slight shake, and said to him \" There\nis not any cross at all \". A change came over the gazer's face as if\nhe were waking from a kind of dream, and he answered \" No, as\nyou say, there is no cross at all '\".\nHe then walked away with Mazzini,\nleaving the rest of the crowd to enjoy their collective hallucination.\nSidgwick always remained greatly impressed with the importance\nof this story in relation to the evidence for the ostensibly super-\nnormal physical phenomena of Spiritualism.\nFrom 1869 onwards Sidgwick began to be associated with Myers\nin a common interest in psychical research. In the very eloquent\nand moving memoir of Sidgwick which Myers contributed to Vol. XV\nof the Proceedings he states that it was during a star-light walk in\nCambridge on December 3, 1869. that he broached the subject to\nSidgwick and determined, if possible, henceforth to pursue the elusive\nquarry with the latter as his guide. Myers had read classics with\nSidgwick as his private tutor when he came up to Trinity as an\nundergraduate in 1860. The occasion of the visit to Cambridge in\nDeceml^er 1869, from which he dates the beginning of their co-\noperation as psychical researchers, was the fact that Myers was\nthen examining for the Moral Science Tripos. The first mention\nof such co-operation in Sidgwick\"s published letters is in a letter to\nMyers dated October 30, 1873. The following passage is so char-\nacteristic as to be well worth quoting. \" As for spirit-rapping I am\nin exactly the same mind towards it as towards religion. I believe\nthere is something in it. don't know what, have tried hard to dis-\ncover, and find that I always paralyse the phenomena. My taste\nis strongly affected by the obvious humbug mixed with it, which\nat the same time my reason does not overestimate.\"\nIn 1871 Sir William Crookes had published, in the Quarterly\nJournal of Science and elsewhere, an account of his experimental\nresearches in the physical phenomena of Spiritualism. He wrote\nfurther articles about it in 1874 and in the same year Alfred Russel\nWallace had published in the Fortnightly Review a paper entitled\n\" A Defence of Modern Spiritualism \". Sidgwick, writing to his\nmother on July 11. 1874, said \" No one should pronounce on the\nprima facie case for serious investigation\u2014this is really all that I\nmaintain on behalf of Spiritualism\u2014who has not read Crookes's\nResearches Sidgwick and Myers now started to investigate to-\ngether, and they formed a small association for the purpose, which.\n\f156] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 137\nwas a kind of forerunner of the S.P.R. Edmund Gurney, who was\nto become one of the most active and important workers in the\nS.P.R., was at first hesitant at joining and contented himself with\ngiving his warmest sympathy to this association. However, A. J.\nBalfour and Lord Rayleigh both joined, and experiments were con-\nducted in their homes. It was in the course of these experiments\nthat Sidgwick met the sister of A. J. Balfour, whom he afterwards\nmarried.\nThese experiments were subsequently described by Mrs Sidgwick\nin an excellent article in Vol. IV of the S.P.R. Proceedings entitled\n\" The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism \". The mediums con-\ncerned in 1874 were Miss Showers, Mrs Jencken {nee Kate Fox), and\nMiss Eva Fay. In the first three months of 1875 Sidgwick, Myers,\nand Gurney had sittings for materiahsation at Newcastle with Miss\nWood and Miss Fairlamb, and they had another series of sittings\nwith the same mediums in London later in the year. Mrs Sidgwick\nwas not 23resent at these, but she was present at a further series held\nin London in July and in Cambridge during August and September.\nThese two mediums quarrelled and separated some time during the\nyear 1876, and the filial sittings, which the Sidgwicks held at New-\ncastle in January 1877, had to be conducted with Miss Wood and\nMiss Fairlamb separately. In 1874, and again in 1876, Sidgwick\nhad a series of sittings with a medium called Williams. Sidgwick\nand Mrs Sidgwick had some sittings in the summer of 1876 with a\nyoung and palpably fraudulent Mr Bullock, who, as Mrs Sidgwick\ndryly remarks, \" may have acted wisely in his own interests when\nhe gave up the career of medium and took to that of exposer of\nSpirituaUsm, as he did six or seven months later \". In the same\nyear the celebrated Dr. Slade came to London. It was reported that\nhis control by four-dimensional spirits had enabled him to tie knots\nin a bit of string whose ends had been sealed together by the German\npsychologist Fechner. He also speciaUsed in causing writing to\nappear inside a locked double slate in answer to questions put by\nsitters. The Sidgwicks had ten sittings with him for slate-writing.\nMrs Sidgwick also had three sittings with Egiinton, another famous\nslate-writing medium of the period.\nThe results of all this work with paid professional medimns for\nphysical phenomena may be fairly summarised as follows. Many\nof the sittings were complete blanks. In some fraud was actually\ndetected and in some there were circumstances which made it almost\ncertain that fraud had been practised. In the very few cases where\nit looked as if a positive supernormal effect had been obtained there\nwas always some unfortunate breakdown in some part of the control,\nI 3\n\f138 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\nor some diversion of the sitters' attention by external interruption,\nwhich made it possible to account for the phenomenon by normal\ncauses. The course of Sidgwick's disillusionment and disgust may\nbe traced in his letters during this period. Writing to Myers at the\nend of 1874 he remarks that he has had to drop Mrs Jencken and\nwill now have to drop Miss Fay out of his \" case for Spiritualism \".\nHe adds the following remarks. \" What induces me, not to abandon,\nbut to restrict, my spiritualistic investigations is not their disagree-\nableness (they have never been other than disagreeable so far as\npaid mediums are concerned) but their persistent and singular frus-\ntration.\" The subsequent experiences of the S.P.R. with physical\nmediums have emphasised the \" persistence \" and diminished the\n\" singularity \" of such frustration.\nIn the autumn of 1876 Professor Ray Lankester instituted criminal\nproceedings against Dr Slade, whom he claimed to have detected\nin fraud. Sidgwick expected, though he did not desire, to be sub-\npoenaed by Ray Lankester's lawyers. Writing on this matter to\nDakyns on October 10, 1876, Sidgwick says that, so far as his own\nexperience goes, he would unhesitatingly pronounce against Slade.\nBut he admits that there is testimony \/'or him which he would like\nto see examined in a court of law.\nThis whole period of Sidgwick's dealings with psychical research\nis well summed up in the following passage from a letter which he\nwrote to Roden Noel on June 24, 1878. \" I have not quite given\nup Spirituahsm, but my investigation of it is a very dreary and\ndisappointing chapter in my life.\"\nWe come now to the revival of Sidgwick's interest which led to\nhis consenting to take an active part in founding and guiding the\nS.P.R. This was due to the apparent success of certain experiments\nin thought-transference which Professor William Barrett had been\ncarrying out at Dublin. At Barrett's instigation a conference was\nconvened, and it met on January 6, 1882. At this conference the\nS.P.R. was planned. It was to include persons of all shades of\nopinion, from sceptical scientists who were reasonable enough to\nadmit that there was a prima facie case for investigation to con-\nvinced Spiritualists who were reasonable enough to admit that there\nwas a great deal of fraud and imposture and self-deception to be\neliminated. Barrett represented the scientific wing and Stainton\nMoses the spiritualistic wing. Myers tells us that he and Gurney,\nwhilst heartily approving the general scheme, consented to join if,\nand only if, Sidgwick would do so and would consent to be President.\nThey encouraged him to undertake this task, but it was only after\nconsiderable hesitation that he accepted. There were strong and\n\f156] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 139\nrespectable motives against doing do. Why should he spend more\nof his time and energy, both of which were very fully occupied in\nwork immediately beneficial to his fellow-men, in order, as Myers\nputs it,\n\" to get the moon for a child who had not even cried for\nit \"? Orthodox believers did not want their special revelation to\nbe shown to be part of a wider system ; and orthodox scientists\ntreated the whole matter at best with compassion and at worst with\ncontempt. On the other hand, Sidgwick had never considered that\nthe original question, which he had spent so much time and trouble\nin investigating with so little result, had been answered in the\nnegative by his abortive researches in the mediumistic underworld.\nThere had never been any moment at which he had felt that he had\nthe right to abandon further investigation of the subject. And he\nhad certain positive motives, connected with his religious, ethical,\nand philosophical perplexities, for wishing the question at issue to\nbe settled definitely in one direction or the other. To these motives\nwe shall return at a later stage.\nAt present it will sufiice to say that eventually Sidgwick con-\nsented to join the S.P.R. and to be its first President. His entry\ncarried with it the adhesion to the Society of several others who\nwere destined to play a most important part in its fife and work.\nIt brought in Mrs Sidgwick, her brothers Arthiir and Gerald Balfour,\nand her brother-in-law. Lord Rayleigh, and, as we have already seen,\nit was the condition without which the Society would have lacked\nthe inestimable services of Edmund Gurney and Frederic Myers.\nMoreover, the fact that Sidgwick, whose reputation for sanity, truth-\nfulness, and fairness was well known to everyone who mattered in\nEngland, was at the head of the Society gave it an intellectual and\nmoral status which was invaluable at the time. It was hardly\npossible to maintain, without writing oneself down as an ass, that\na society over which Sidgwick presided and in whose work he was\nactively interested consisted of knaves and fools concealing super-\nstition under the cloak of scientific verbiage. Needless to say, this\nfeat was not found to exceed the capacity of some critics ;\nbut, with\nalmost anyone else as President, their numbers would have been far\ngreater and their influence might have sufficed to kill the Society\nin its infancy.\nSidgwick gave his inaugural address to the S.P.R. on July 17,\n1882. He dehvered a second presidential address on December 9\nof the same year, and a third on July 18, 1883. These will be found\nin Vol. I of the Proceedings. Vol. II contains another presidential\naddress delivered on May 28, 1884. He resigned the Presidentship\nin 1885, thinking that the Society could now profit from a change,\n\f140 Professor G. D. Broad, Litt.D. [PAET\nbut at the same time lie undertook the editorship of the Journal.\nHis successor in the presidential chair was Balfour Stewart.\nDuring the year 1884 the S.P.R. appointed a committee to take\nevidence in London from leading members of the Theosophical\nSociety about the marvellous phenomena alleged to have taken place\nin India in connexion with Madame Blavatsky and certain other\nmembers of her sect. Madame Blavatsky, Colonel Olcott, and a\nBrahmin disciple called Mohini spent some months in London and\ngave evidence to this committee. Sidgwick as President was ex\nofficio a member. The Theosophical contingent visited Cambridge\nearly in August, attended a meeting in Oscar Browning's rooms in\nKing's, and were entertained to luncheon by Myers. The Sidgwicks\nrather liked Madame Blavatsky, who was evidently an engaging old\nhumbug with a rich and racy personality and full of courage and\nresource. They found her, it is true, externally unattractive and\nnot prepossessing in manner ; and indeed her habit of smoking\nincessant cigarettes and indulging in relatively strong language,\nthough it would pass unnoticed in our more enlightened age, could\nhardly fail to attract unfavourable attention in a Cambridge drawing-\nroom of the eighteen-eighties. Sidgwick says of her in his diary for\nAugust 10. \"If she is a humbug, she is a consummate one ; as her\nremarks have the air not only of spontaneity and randomness but\nof an amusing indiscretion.\" (She had referred to a certain Mahatma,\na class of beings for whom the Theosophists entertained the highest\nreverence, as \" the most utter dried-up old mummy \" that she ever\nsaw.)\nThe Theosophical sub-committee issued a balanced interim report\nwhich was privately printed and circulated to members of the S.P.R.\nAt the end of it they announced that Richard Hodgson was on his\nway to India to investigate and report at first hand. Hodgson com-\npleted his task and returned to England in April 1885. His evidence\nas to the fraudulent character of the Theosophical marvels was\ndamning ;\nthough one could have wished that he had not had to\nrely so much on the revelations of two discharged employees of\nMadame Blavatsky who had quarrelled with her and were busily\nengaged in biting the hand which had not ungenerously fed them.\nThe final report, embodying Hodgson's findings, was written mainly\nby Mrs Sidgwick. It occupies a considerable part of Vol. Ill of the\nProceedings and is easily the most dramatic and entertaining bit of\nwork that the Society has ever published.\nDuring the latter part of 1884 Mrs Sidgwick was working at the\nimportant paper on \" Phantasms of the Dead \", which she read on\nJanuary 30, 1885. It is published in Vol. Ill of the Proceedings.\n\f156] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 141\nIn preparation for it Sidgwick investigated critically the numerous\nghost-stories that had been sent to the S.P.R., and in September\n1884 he made a tour to interview persons who had contributed such\nstories. He says that the evidence is not so good as for phantasms\nof the Uving, and that out of about three hundred cases not more\nthan twenty or thirty can be pronounced good. After returning\nfrom his tour of interviewing he remarks \" The stories that become\nworse after oral examination are those that we had already judged\nto be objectionable, and some are decidedly improved by the exami-\nnation \". His comment after Mrs Sidgwick had read her paper was\n\" It looks as if there was some cause for persons experiencing inde-\npendently in certain houses similar hallucinations. But we are not\nat present inclined to back ghosts against the field as the cause.\"\nIn the meanwhile Myers, Gurney, and Podmore were busily engaged\nin comminuting and refining those masses of crude ore from which\nthe two volumes of Phantasms of the Living were eventually smelted.\nThis is undoubtedly an epoch-making work, in the strict sense that\nit laid the foundations of a new subject and still remains a classic\nindispensable to all students in its own field. Both Sidgwick and\nhis wife were, of course, in constant touch with the authors at all\nstages of their work.\nIn June 1885 Myers read his introduction to Phantasms of the\nLiving as a paper to the S.P.R. Sidgwick's comments in his diary\nare of great interest. \" In the end \", he says, \" if the S.P.R. 's work\nshould all be negative, it will be regarded by sceptics as the last\nelement of proof necessary to complete the case against Christianity\nand other historical religions. But\/or a long time the only difference\nwould be that those religions will have to support their miracles\ninstead of being supported by them. They can go on doing this for\na long time until sociology, has been really constructed and the\nscientist steps into the place of the priest.\" The same thought is\nexpressed in the following sentence of Myers's Obituary Notice\non Sidgwick. \" It would be hard for future men to persuade them-\nselves that what in ages of knowledge and clarity was seen to be\nfraud and illusion had yet been verity and revelation in the confused\nobscurity of the past.\" Neither Sidgwick nor Myers could foresee\nthat in another fifty years compulsory education would have pro-\nduced throughout the civilised world a populace of Hterate imbeciles,\nready to believe or to disbelieve anything with equal passion and\nunreason, and that science would have provided, in the cheap press\nand the wireless, an immensely powerful engine for generating irra-\ntional behefs and disbehefs at will. Before taking leave of this topic\nwe may recall the remark in which Gibbon contrived to twit both\n\f142 Professor C. D. Broad, Lift.D. [part\nthe Jews and the Christians. Referring to the rejection, by the Jews\nof apostolic times, of those stupendous miracles which, according to\nthe Christians, were happening under their very noses. Gibbon\nremarks :\n\" Contrary to every known principle of the human mind,\nthat singxilar people seem to have attached a more explicit credence\nto the testimony of their remote ancestors than to the evidence of\ntheir own senses \".\nSidgwick's central position, and his oscillations about it, during\nthis period are well brought out by the following quotations from\nhis diary. On January 3, 1886, after a meeting of the S.P.R., which\nnow had 600 members and associates and could, in his opinion,\n\" run without further nursing \", he wrote as follows :\n\" I do not\ndoubt that thought-transference is genuine, and I hope that it will\nsoon be established beyond cavil ; but I see no prospect of making\nany way in the far more interesting investigation of Spiritualism.\"\nOn March 7 of the same year, after listening to a mildly spiritualistic\npaper by Sir William Barrett, he wrote \" I feel that the natural\ndrift of my mind is now towards total incredulity in respect of\nextra-human intelligences. I have to remind myself forcibly of the\narguments on the other side, just as a year ago I had to dwell\ndeliberately on the sceptical argument to keep myself balanced.\"\nOn January 28, 1887, he wrote \" I am drifting steadily to the con-\nclusion that we have not and are not likely to have empirical\nevidence of the existence of the individual after death \". On July 16,\n1888, after giving an address to the S.P.R. in which he pleaded for\nthe collection of further cases of spontaneous telepathic action, he\nwrote \" I have not much hope of our getting at positive results\nin any other department of our enquiry, but I am not yet hopeless\nof establishing telepathy \".\nEven about telepathy, which he regarded as established to his\nown satisfaction, he was subject to the set-backs and disappoint-\nments which are the lot of the psychical researcher. In his diary\nfor November 29, 1884, he writes \" I am shaken in my view of the\ntelepathic evidence by the breakdown of Sir E. H.'s narrative in\nthe Nineteenth Century. He tells an elaborate story of what hap-\npened to him less than ten years ago. His wife, who was an actor\nin it, confirms it. Her mother bears witness that the wife told her\nnext morning. Yet the story is inaccurate in fundamental details\n\u2014\nit is difficult to understand how any of it can be true.\" Lastly, there\nwas a sad disappointment in his experiments with Miss Relph at\nLiverpool. Sidgwick investigated her claims to telepathic powers\nin March 1887. On the 30th the results were so good that he was\nable to say \" they leave no doubt in my own mind that I had wit-\n\f156] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 143\nnessed the real phenomena \". On March 31 the attempts to repeat\nthe results under unexceptionable \" conditions \" were a complete\nfailure. Sidgwick stUl accepted the former results, but reaUsed that\nthey were not enough to convince an outsider.\nOn June 25, 1888, there befell one of the great tragedies of psychical\nresearch, viz., the sudden death, at a comparatively early age, of\nEdmund Gurney through an overdose of chloroform taken for\nneuralgia or insomnia. It was a terrible blow to the Sidgwicks\npersonally, and it wiU be evident to anyone who has studied Phan-\ntasms of the Living or read the admirable articles which Gurney con-\ntributed to the early volumes of the Proceedings that his death was\nan irreparable loss to the Society and to the subject. Sidgwick had\nnow become President of the S.P.R. for a second period after a con-\nsiderable interval, and he delivered his presidential address on July\n16, 1888, three weeks after Gurney's death. This brings us by a\nnatural transition to the next important piece of work with which\nthe Sidgwicks were closely concerned, viz., the S.P.R.'s Census of\nHallucinations.\nEveryone is familiar with stories of the following kind. A has\nan hallucinatory visual, auditory, or tactual perception in which he\nseems to himself to be seeing or hearing or touching a certain friend\nor acquaintance B. Afterwards, A learns that B was dpng or in\nserious danger at the time when the hallucination was experienced.\nThe S.P.R. was naturally inundated with stories of this kind and\nits first business was, of course, to weed out all the cases which might\nreasonably be explained l)y misreporting, exaggeration, errors of\nmemory, normal expectation and inference, and so on. When this\nhad been done there remained a substantial residue of such stories\nwhich appeared incapable of any normal explanation. As regards\nthis residue only two alternatives were open. Either the approxi-\nmate simultaneity between the hallucination in A and the death or\nillness or accident in B was a mere coincidence, or there was some\nsupernormal causal connexion between the two. It had been quite\nevident to Gurney that no rational decision between these two\nalternatives was possible except on a statistical basis. It was\nessential to know how frequently such hallucinatory experiences\noccur among sane waking persons in contemporary civilised societies.\nThe more frequent they are, the more likely it is that some of them\nwill happen to coincide with the death or danger of the person whom\nthey concern. Now this was a subject on which no reliable statistics\nexisted at the time. In Phantasms of the Living he had attempted\nan estimate of the frequency of such hallucinations among contem-\nporary Englishmen from the data at his disposal. He had come to\n\f144 Professor G. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\nthe conclusion that, whilst they are much commoner than one would\nhave been inclined to believe, they are not nearly common enough\nto make it reasonable to regard those which turn out to be veridical\nas mere chance coincidences. But he was well aware that the\nquestion could never be satisfactorily settled until a direct statistical\nenquiry on a very large scale had been made in order to determine\nthe frequency of such experiences, veridical and delusive, among\nthe population.\nSidgwick was most anxious that such an enquiry should be carried\nout, both because of its extreme scientific importance and because\nit would round off the work of his dead friend and colleague. Accord-\ningly he induced the S.P.R. to appoint a committee, consisting of\nhimself, Mrs Sidgwick, Myers, Podmore, and Miss Alice Johnson, in\norder to undertake a census by means of a questionnaire. The col-\nlection of statistics went on steadily between the spring of 1889 and\nthat of 1894. It entailed an immense amount of very tedious work.\nSidgwick introduced the subject to the Society in a special address\non July 8, 1889, in which he explained the importance of the census,\nasked for volunteer collectors, and pointed out the precautions which\nought to be taken. He gave a second address on the subject on\nJuly 11, 1890, in which he reports the progress already made, urges\nthe members of the Society to fresh efforts, and comments on certain\ntypes of hallucination which have been reported. In the summer\nof 1889 the Sidgwicks attended an international congress of psychol-\nogists at Paris. Owing to the presence of Richet, whom Sidgwick\nhad first met in October 1885 and had greatly liked, there was much\ndiscussion on psychical research. The congress gave its sanction to\na census of hallucinations on the same lines as that conducted in\nEngland by the S.P.R.\nThe S.P.R. committee published its final report in Vol. X of the\nProceedings. It occupies about 400 pages and is a most masterly\nproduction. It was written mainly by Mrs Sidgwick and Miss\nJohnson, in close consultation with Sidgwick himself. The upshot\nof the enquiry was as follows. About one visual hallucination in\nsixty-three occurs within a period of twenty-four hours round about\nthe death of the person whose apparition has been \" seen \". If such\ndeath-coincidences were purely fortuitous concurrences of causally\nindependent events the proportion would be about one in nineteen\nthousand. There is a most elaborate and careful discussion of the\nfallacies to which such statistics are liable, and a very clear and\ndetailed statement of the precautions which the committee took to\navoid them. Anyone who now argues airily on this subject without\nhaving studied this report is merely wasting his own and his hearer's\n\f166] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 145\ntime. Yet I venture to doubt whether so much as one per cent, of\nthe teachers and students of experimental psychology in this country\nhave ever troubled to flutter the pages of what is, on any view, a\nunique and meticulously careful contribution to an important branch\nof their subject.\nFrom the spring of 1885 onwards the Sidgwicks had from time to\ntime taken part in experiments on thought-transference in connexion\nwith hypnotised subjects. Sidgwick records visits to Brighton for\nthis purpose on March 22 and July 4, 1885. On January 10, 1887,\nhe mentions the abortive conclusion of a week's investigation of a\nprofessional mesmerist, Mr D., who pretended to transmit ideas to\nhis mesmeric \" subject \". In spite of the fact that Mr D. had been\na French master in a school and had a brother who was a Cambridge\ngraduate and a clerk in Holy Orders, he was detected by Richard\nHodgson using a code which depended on the variations in the\nsubject's breathing. A much more important series of hypnotic\nexperiments was carried out in the summer of 1889 with Mr G. A.\nSmith as hypnotist and telepathic agent, and two young clerks,\nwhom he mesmerised, as telepathic percipients. The results of these\nexperiments formed the subject of an article in Vol. VI of the\nS.P.R.'s Proceedings. The successes were altogether beyond chance,\nand in view of the precautions taken it is difficult to think of any\nnormal explanation for them. Further experiments with the same\nhypnotist and the same subjects were carried out by Mrs Sidgwick\nand Miss Alice Johnson in the years 1890, 1891, and 1892. The\nreport of them will be found in Vol. VIII of the Proceedings. The\nresults are, in some respects, more remarkable, since successes well\nabove chance were scored with Smith and his subjects in different\nrooms.\nA sequel to these hypnotic experiments was the occasion for\nSidgwick's last contribution to the Proceedings. Two Danish psychol-\nogists, Messrs. Lehmann and Hansen of Copenhagen, published in\nWundt's PJiilosophische Studien a long paper describing their experi-\nments on what they called \" involuntary whispering \". Now most\nof the work on transference of ideas which Sidgwick and his wife\nhad done with Mr Smith and his subjects was concerned with guess-\ning two-digit numbers printed on discs which Smith drew from a\nbag and concentrated his attention upon. On the basis of the\nCopenhagen experiments Messrs Lehmann and Hansen claimed to\nshow that the degree of success scored by Smith's hypnotised sub-\njects could be explained by supposing that Smith involuntarily\nwhispered the numbers as he concentrated his attention upon them,\nand that his subjects were in a state of auditory hyperaesthesia.\n\f146 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\nAs a matter of fact the Sidgwicks had carefully considered this\npossibility and had discussed it elaborately in their first report in\nVol. VI of the Proceedings. Moreover, in the second series of experi-\nments, reported in Vol. VIII, a significant degree of success had\nbeen scored when Smith was out of the room and on a different\nfloor from that occupied by the percipients. Nevertheless, Sidgwick\nthought that Messrs Lehmann and Hansen's suggestions were im-\nportant enough to merit serious attention, since they certainly threw\nfresh light on the hypothesis of unconscious whispering.\nHe began by repeating the experiments, in a somewhat simplified\nform, with his wife and Miss Johnson. They found that in all cases\nthe whispering was completely voluntary, and they detected in them-\nselves no trace of that tendency to involuntary whispering which the\nDanish psychologists had alleged to be the natural accompaniment\nof attempts to concentrate on a number. But they verified the\nCopenhagen claims to the following extent. They found that it was\nquite possible for a person deliberately to whisper in such a way that\nan observer who fixed his attention on that person's mouth and lips\ncould neither see nor hear any signs of whispering at a distance of\ntwo feet. And yet, at a distance of eighteen inches between this\nperson's mouth and a percipient's ear, the percipient could hear\nenough of the agent's whispering to score a considerable amount of\nsuccess in his guesses. It is therefore reasonable to assume that,\nif the hypnotic agent whispered in this special way, a hypnotised\nsubject, in special rafport with him, might hear distinctly at a con-\nsiderably greater distance without any sign of whispering being\naudible or visible to third parties. Sidgwick noted that if an\nobserver directed his attention to the ncch and throa t of the whisperer,\ninstead of his mouth and lips, the fact that whispering was taking\nplace became obvious. Accordingly he undertook some further\nexperiments with Smith, concentrating his attention on the latter's\nneck and throat without telling Smith that he was doing so. He\nused as percipient Mrs Verrall, who had practised detecting whisper-\ning with Mrs Sidgwick and Miss Johnson. The result was com-\npletely negative. Sidgwick could see no special movements in\nSmith's neck and throat, and Mrs Verrall could hear no whispers\ncoming from Smith.\nSidgwick published these results in an important note on \" Involun-\ntary Whispering\n'\n' which he contributed to Vol. XII of the Proceedings.\nAfter stating his experimental conclusions, he undertook an elaborate\nstatistical analysis of the mistakes which had been made in guessing\nnumbers in the hypnotic experiments and in Messrs Lehmann and\nHansen's researches. He claimed to show that the distribution of\n\f156] Henry Sidgivick and Psychical Research 147\nmistakes among the Copenhagen guesses closely resembled the dis-\ntribution of mistakes among the guesses made by the English hypno-\ntised subjects on their unsuccessful days, when their scores were\nplainly due to chance. He ascribed this similarity to a likeness in\nnumber-habits between the English and the Danish subjects. Whilst\nI accept Sidgwick's conclusion that it is most unlikely that the\nsuccess of the hypnotic experiments can be explained by involuntary\nwhispering, I am not altogether satisfied with his statistical argu-\nment and I should like to see the whole subject treated again by\nmodern statistical methods which have become available since\nSidgwick's day.\nThe rest of Sidgwick's activities in connexion with psychical re-\nsearch can be very briefly described. They were concerned with\nthe physical medium, Eusapia Palladino, and the mental medium,\nMrs Piper. In the summer of 1894 Myers and Sir Oliver Lodge, in\ncompany with Richet, were investigating Eusapia at lie Roubaud.\nThey wrote to Sidgwick stating that they thought they had got\nphysical phenomena under test conditions. He and Mrs Sidgwick\ntherefore went out to France. The phenomena, as usual in their\npresence, became less striking, but at the time he was almost con-\nvinced that some of them were genuinely supernormal. In August\n1895 Eusapia stayed at Myers's house in Cambridge and was sub-\njected to an elaborate investigation. The Sidgwicks concluded that\nher phenomena were fraudulent, and that they were produced by a\ncertain trick which was suspected at an early stage and was worked\nout in detail by Hodgson. It is significant that Eusapia steadily\nrefused to comply with conditions which would have excluded the\nuse of this method.\nThe discovery of Mrs Piper in Boston by Professor William James\nwas the beginning of an important new stage in the development\nof psychical research and the work of the Society. Her mediumship\nhas been of the utmost importance because it gave results which\nare quite certainly supernormal and which seem, jmma facie, to be\nvery difficult to explain without going beyond telepathy from the\nliving. It is roughly true to say that Sidgwick's death happened at\na transition point in the history of the subject. In the past were\nthe comparatively straightforward problems of the experimental and\nstatistical establishment of the transference of simple concrete ideas\nand emotions. In the future lay the subtle and complex problems\nof cross-correspondences, book-tests, and so on, in which we are still\nimmersed. Mrs Piper's mediumship is the connecting link between\nthe two stages, and Sidgwick lived only long enough to participate\nin the very early phases of the investigation. Myers and others\n\f148 Professor C. D. Broad, Litf.D. [part\ninvited Mrs Piper to England in the winter of 1889, and she stayed\nuntil the spring of 1890. Sidgwick took a prominent part in the\ninvestigations. He had no success in his own sittings with her, but\nhe was much impressed by the experiences of some of his friends.\nSubsequent work with Mrs Piper was mainly conducted in the U.S.A.\nunder the direction of Richard Hodgson.\nMrs Sidgwick survived her husband for many years and main-\ntained up to the end her active interest in the Society and her\ninvaluable work on the subject. We have her own authority for\nstating that, in her opinion, the evidence as a whole provides an\nadequate ground for believing that human beings survive bodily\ndeath. One would give a great deal to know whether the facts\nwhich became available after 1900 would have caused Sidgwick\nhimself to accept so positive a conclusion.\nHaving supplied the reader with a fairly adequate history of\nSidgwick's dealings with psychical research, I will now say some-\nthing about the nature and extent of his contributions to the sub-\nject. His own estimate of his capacities is characteristically modest\nand accurate. It is recorded in an entry in his diary for September\n11, 1884. He thinks that he has a mind much better qualified for\nseeing relations in the history of thought than for suggesting hypo-\ntheses in psychical research. \" I don't feel the least gift \", he says,\n\" for making a legitimate hypothesis as to the causes of the pheno-\nmena, and I am too unobservant and unimaginative about physical\nevents to be at all good at evaluating particular bits of evidence. . . .\nTo tell whether a '\npsychical '\nexperiment or narrative is good or\nnot, evidentially, requires one to imagine with adequate accuracy\nand exhaustiveness the various possibilities of '\nnatural ' causation\nof the phenomenon, and judge the degree of improbability of each.\nNora is much better at all this than I am. ...\" This extremely\nhigh and very just appreciation of Mrs Sidgwick's powers is reiterated\non May 2, 1894, where he says that his only reason for doubting\nwhether she was right in accepting the Principalship of Newnham\nis that he fears \" that she may not find time for the work of the\nS.P.R.\", for which, he says, \" I thinlv her uniquely fit\u2014much more\nfit than I am \". He thinks that in psychical research the one function\nthat he can exercise is the judicial. \" I feel equal to classifying and\nto some extent weighing the evidence, so far as it depends on general\nconsiderations.\"\nMaking due allowance for Sidgwick's natural modesty and gener-\nosity, I think that this estimate of his powers is essentially correct\nso far as it goes. His main contribution to psychical research did\nnot consist in making ingenious experiments or suggesting fruitful\n\f156] Henry Sidgivich and Psychical Research 149\nand far-reaching hypotlieses. It consisted in the weight which his\nknown intelUgence and integrity gave to the serious study of the\nsubject, in the tact and patience with which he handled the very\ndifi&cult team which he had to lead rather than to drive, in the\nextremely high standard of evidence which he inculcated both by\nexample and by precept, in his courage and persistence in face of\nrepeated failure when success seemed almost within reach, and in\nthe general maxims which he laid down in his various addresses to\nthe S.P.R. It will be worth our while to consider in some detail\nthe teachings of Sidgwick's presidential addresses, for they are still\nhighly relevant to contemporary conditions.\nThe first three are concerned with the raison d'etre of the S.P.R.\n,\nwith certain criticisms which had been made on the very idea of\nsuch a society, and with the nature of the evidence which already\nexists and the further evidence which is required. When he occupied\nthe presidential chair for the second period he devoted his first two\naddresses to a survey of the work of the S.P.R. since its beginning,\nan account of the modification which experience had shown to be\nnecessary in the original plan of campaign, and an answer to certain\ncriticisms to which it had been subjected from various quarters.\nHis third presidential address of this period was explicitly concerned\nwith the Canons of Evidence in Psychical Research.\nAccording to Sidgwick the fundamental cause of the characteristic\ndifficulty and controversy which attaches to psychical research is\nthe fact that we are called upon to weigh one improbability against\nanother. We have to balance the antecedent improbability of the\nevents reported against the antecedent improbability that sane and\nrespectable witnesses should be lying or should be deceived in rele-\nvant respects. Now there is no rule for estimating the antecedent\nimprobabihty of such events as the reported physical phenomena of\nmediumship, hauntings, telepathy, clairvoyance, etc. We have no\nmeans of telling what proportion the facts that we know about the\n\" habits \" of matter and of mind bears to the facts of which we are\nstill ignorant. As regards the reliability of witnesses and their\nreports there are some general rules. When normal people, with\nno obvious motives for deception, testify to quite ordinary events\nwe do not raise questions about the probability of their testimony\nbeing false. But in the law courts, if the testimony of two such\npersons to a quite ordinary event conflicts, we do raise this question.\nFor a precisely similar reason we must raise it when a witness, how-\never intelligent and respectable, testifies to an extraordinary event.\nNow it is known that the main sources of error are the following :\n(1) alteration and heightening of a story that passes through a chain\n\f150 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\nof narrators ; (2) errors of memory even in first-hand reports ; (3)\nfailure to observe relevant details and tendency to mistake inferences\nfor observations ; (4) lastly, if another person beside the witness\nwas present he may have produced an illusion in the witness's mind.\nTherefore we have to consider (a) any facts about the observer which\nmight tend to make him the victim of an illusion, and (b) any facts\nabout the second person which make it likely that he was able or\nwilling to produce an illusion in the witness.\nIn Sidgwick's opinion two important consequences follow. In the\nfirst place, it is plain that in every case the probabilities can be\nonly vaguely estimated, and in many cases they must be estimated\ndifferently by different people according to their knowledge of beliefs\nabout the character of the persons concerned. Therefore great and\nirreconcilable differences of opinion are inevitable, and it is useless\nto bewail them and unreasonable to complain of the slow rate at\nwhich the subject progresses.\nSecondly, all talk of \" crucial \" experiments, \" knock-down\n\"\nproofs or disproofs, \" completely water-tight \" cases, is futile. We\nmust make each individual experiment and report as \" water-tight\n\"\nas we can, and we must go on accumulating more and more such\ncases. Neither quality alone nor quantity alone will produce con-\nviction ;\nnothing will do so except a constant stream of cases in\nwhich the evidence is of the highest quality.\nSince this is a matter about which there is still frequent discussion\nin our Society, and since Sidgwick seems to me to have said exactly\nthe right things about it, I propose to state his views in rather more\ndetail. First, as regards quantity and the need for a constant supply\nof fresh cases. In no single case, Sidgwick says, can the admissi-\nbility of normal explanations be absolutely excluded. This is im-\npossible \" even in the case of our own most conclusive experiments,\nwhen regarded from the point of view of the outside public. For\nall records of experiments must depend ultimately on the probity\nand intelligence of the persons recording them ; and it is impossible\nfor us or any other investigators to demonstrate to persons who do\nnot know us that we are not idiotically careless or consciously men-\ndacious.\" It is sometimes alleged that the S.P.R.'s demand for\nquantity shows that the quality of the available evidence is poor.\nThis is not true. The quality of much of it is very good ; it would\nbe regarded without hesitation as conclusive if the alleged facts were\nnot antecedently so improbable. The need for accumulating evidence\nis in order to swamp the antecedent improbability of the events to\nwhich it bears witness.\nThere are two other points which may conveniently be treated\n\f156] Henrtj Sidgwick and Psychical Research 151\nunder this head of quantity. The first is a warning which Sidgwick\ngave to the Society soon after the pubhcation of Phantasms of the\nLiving Many members were inclined then, and I suspect that stili\nmore are inclined now, to regard the case for spontaneous telepathy\nas estabhshed, and to think that it is not worth while to trouble to\ncollect and investigate fresh alleged instances of it. Sidgwick pointed\nout the extreme folly of this tendency to be at ease m Sion Unless\na fairly constant stream of well-attested cases is produced sceptics\nwill certainly argue as follows :\n\" On the basis of the statistics which\nyou pubUshed in Phantasms of the Living and in the Census of Hal-\nlucinations there should be roughly so many fresh cases m England\nevery year. If there were, you would, presumably, receive and\npublish a fair proportion of them. Since you do not, it is reasonable\nto suppose that they do not happen nearly so frequently as the\nEarly Fathers of your Society alleged. And so the statistical case\nwhich they built up may be dismissed.\" No doubt it is logically\ncogent to answer \" We don't get such cases, simply because our mem-\nbers regarding spontaneous telepathy as an established fact, don t\nbother to look for them, or to investigate those which are brought\nto their notice, or to report those which they have noticed and\ninvestigated \". But, though logically satisfactory, this answer is\nquite useless for the practical purpose of convincing sceptics\nThe other point which may, with a little stretching, be brought\nunder the head of quantity of evidence is the following. Critics m\nthe very early days of the S.P.R. constantly said, as they constantly\nsay now, that no experimental result will satisfy them unless it can\nbe reproduced at will in the presence of any number of sceptical\nobservers. To this Sidgwick makes the obviously sensible answer\nthat, whilst we should all be delighted to have evidence of this kind,\nwe have no right to assume that it must be attainable. ( io take an\nexample from important physiological work which been done\nsince Sidgwick's day, it was only with enormous difficulty that\nPavlov was able to secure such complete uniformity m the internal\nand external conditions of the animals on which he experimented\nthat his experiments gave uniform results. And the presence of a\nstranger, or even of the experimenter himself, completely upsets the\nreaction of the animal, although this takes only the very simple\nform of salivation. It is at least as likely that thought-transference\nif it happens at all depends on a peculiar relation between agent\nand percipient which is very easily upset, as that the salivation of\ndogs in Pavlov's experiments is partly dependent on a whole complex\nof background conditions which can be kept constant only with great\ndifficulty.)\n\f152 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\nWe can now leave the subject of quantity and pass to Sidgwick's\nviews about the quahty of evidence which the S.P.R. should demand.\nHe is perfectly clear that a mere accumulation of inferior evidence\nis of no use. In each single experiment, he says, \" we have done all\nthat we can when the critic has nothing left to allege except that\nthe investigator is in the trick. But, when he has nothing left to\nallege, he will allege that.\" No evidence should be published until\nit reaches that degree of cogency. \" We must drive the objector\ninto the position of being forced either to admit the phenomena as\ninexplicable, at least by him, or to accuse the investigators either\nof lying or cheating or of a blindness or forgetfulness incompatible\nwith any intellectual condition except absolute idiocy.\" These\nquotations are taken from Sidgwick's presidential address of July\n17, 1882. He returned to the topic in his address of May 10, 1889,\nand I will quote one sentence from the latter.\n'\n' My highest ambition\nin psychical research is to produce evidence which will drive my\nopponents to doubt my honesty or veracity. I think that there is a\nvery small minority of persons who will not doubt them, and that,\nif I can convince them, I have done all that I can do. As regards\nthe majority even of my own acquaintances I should claim no more\nthan an admission that they were considerably surprised to find me\nin the trick.\"\nThere is one other remark made by Sidgwick which is worth men-\ntioning because it still has constant application. In his presidential\naddress of July 18, 1883, he refers to various normal explanations\nof ostensibly supernormal phenomena. After detailing these, and\nsaying that every one of them is a vera causa which must be excluded\nbefore we can seriously consider any claim to supernormality, he\nproceeds to make the following highly pertinent remark. It is a\nvery common fallacy to put forward a normal explanation which\naccounts very satisfactorily for nine-tenths of the phenomena of a\ncertain kind, but fails to account for the remaining one-tenth which\nare equally well attested ; and then either to ignore this recalcitrant\nresidue or to reject the reports of it and claim that one's normal\nexplanation covers all the facts. As Sidgwick says, \"It is not a\nscientific way of dealing with testimony to explain what you can\nand say that the rest is untrue. It may be common-sense, but it is\nnot science.\" He cites as an example Faraday's well-known explana-\ntion of table-turning. This is a valuable explanation of most of the\nphenomena. But there are well-attested stories of tables moving\nwithout contact or rising wliolly off the ground, and, if a single one\nof these is true, Faraday's theory does not fit all the facts. It seems\nto me that Sidgwick here puts his finger on a besetting weakness\n\f156] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 153\nof the late Mr Podmore, and that that distinguished member of our\nSociety has left spiritual descendants who are with us at this day.\nNo accovmt of Sidgwick's dealings with psychical research would\nbe complete if it ignored the ethical and religious motives which\ninfluenced him in taking it up and in persisting with it. I will there-\nfore conclude my paper with a brief account of this factor in his hfe.\nWe must begin by reminding ourselves that Sidgwick was the son\nof a clergyman, that he was brought up as an Anglican Christian,\nand that it was not untU his twenty-second or twenty-third year\nthat he finally abandoned the idea of taking Orders. Next, we must\nremember that reports of miraculous events play two parts in\nChristianity, one being absolutely essential and the other useful but\ndispensable. Christianity differs from most of the other great re-\nligions of mankind in the following way. An essential part of its\ndoctrine consists in propositions about the nature and unique status\nin the imiverse of its own Founder. Therefore certain miracles, such\nas his reported resurrection and his subsequent appearances to the\napositles, are parts of Christian doctrine, and not merely parts of the\nevidence for Christianity. Other alleged miracles, such as those per-\nformed by Christ during his ministry or by the apostles afterwards,\nare in a different position. If every one of them were rejected, no\nsingle doctrine of Christianity would need to be modified in the\nsmallest degree. The importance of these miracles, if genuine, is\nevidential. The fact that Christ was able to perform them, and that\nhe was able to convey to his apostles the power to perform similar,\nif somewhat less spectacular, miracles, is held to be strong confirma-\ntion of the Christian doctrine about his unique nature and meta-\nphysical status. Now in England, when Sidgwick was a young man,\nenormous stress was laid on the New Testament miracles as evidence\nfor the truth of Christianity. But it is alleged by followers of other\nreligions that similar miracles have occurred in connexion with them,\nby Roman Catholics that such miracles have continued in their\nChurch without cessation from apostolic times up to the present\nday, and by Spiritualists that they are happening here and now in\nmediumistic seances. These allegations placed the standard Protes-\ntant argument from the New Testament miracles in an extremely\nawkward dilemma for anyone as clear-sighted as Sidgwick. Either\nthe New Testament miracles were unique or they were not. If they\nwere unique, they would, no doubt, provide an imique support for\nChristianity against its rivals. But, in that case, the whole burden\nwould ultimately rest on the trustworthiness of the stories recorded\nin the New Testament and the untrustworthiness of all the innumer-\nable similar stories told in connexion with other rehgions and by\n\f154 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\ncontemporary Spiritualists. If they were not unique, it might be\nmuch easier to accept them as rare but not unparalleled phenomena.\nBut then they could provide no special evidence for the truth of\nspecifically Christian doctrine.\nSidgwick's earlier struggles, like those of most of his intelligent\ncontemporaries, were to disengage himself from the first horn of this\ndilemma. He had been deeply impressed in 1862 by reading Kenan's\nEtudes d'Histoire Religieuse, and he set himself to learn Hebrew and\nArabic in order to make a comparative historical study of religion.\nIn a letter to A. J. Balfour written in 1897, describing his position\nin the sixties, he says that what he then wanted in theology was\nthat the evidences for historical Christianity should be examined\nwith complete scientific impartiality \" as a duly instructed rational\nbeing from another planet (or, let us say, from China) would natur-\nally weigh them \". Looking back, we can see that the result was\na foregone conclusion. By the middle sixties Sidgwick had reached\nthe position that no religion which depended on the correctness of\nhistorical statements about mysterious events in a foreign country\nand a remote period could possibly reach the evidential standard\nwhich he demanded. Writing to Dakyns at the end of 1864, he\nsays \" I have never before freed my innermost consciousness from\nthe thraldom of a historical belief. Long after the belief had gone\nthe impression remained that it was all-important to have a view\non the historical question.\" Now he has reached the conclusion that\nthere has been enough study of the Bible. What is needed is a com-\nparative study of the mystical and of ecstasy ; the remote past being\nalways subordinated to the present.\nIn 1869 Sidgwick resigned his fellowship, but he stated at the\nsame time, in a letter to Benson, that he had no desire to leave the\nChurch of England. In 1870 he published a book on The Ethics of\nClerical Subscrij)tion. His mature views on this subject are clearly\nexpressed in a letter which he wrote in May 1881 to J. R. Mozley\nin answer to a question which the latter had put to him. He said\nthat a layman could conscientiously be a member of the Church of\nEngland, provided that he accepted the Apostles' Creed ; but he\nadded that on one could be said to accept this honestly unless he\naccepted the miraculous birth of Christ. Anyone who proposed to\ntake an office which involved membership of the Church of England\nwould be dishonest in doing so if he doubted this dogma, and no\nbishop could dispense him. If, on the other hand, it were merely\na question of taking part in the worship and the sacraments of the\nChurch of England as a private individual, a much laxer standard\nwas permissible, and a bishop's permission might be highly relevant.\n\f156] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 155\nThe religious position which Sidgwick had reached by the age of\nforty-two is very clearly stated in a letter which he wrote in the\nsummer of 1880 to Major Carey, an old Kugbeian friend. The follow-\ning are the essential points. It is now long since he could imagine\nhimself believing Christianity after the orthodox fashion. He is not,\nindeed, inclined to reject the miraculous as such ; but it is clear to\nhim that, if you accept it in Christianity, you cannot reject it off-\nhand in other religions or in modern Spiritualism. For many years\npast he has not thought of Christianity except as the creed of his\nfriends, fellow-countrymen, etc. As regards Theism, he says \" I\ndon't know whether I believe or only hojje that there is a moral order\nin the universe ... a supreme principle of Wisdom and Benevolence\nguiding all things to good ends and to the happiness of the good.\nI hope this. I don't think it can be proved. No opposed explanation\nof the origin of the cosmos\u2014e.g., the atomistic theory\u2014seems to me\neven plausible. And I cannot accept life on any other terms or\nconstruct a, rational system of my own conduct except on the basis\nof this faith.\" He recognises that his correspondent might well say\n\" The question is, not whether you would like to believe in God,\nbut whether the belief is true \". To this, Sidgwick says, he would\nanswer by asking the following question :\n\" What guarantee have\nyou for the fundamental beliefs of science except that they are con-\nsistent and harmonious with other beliefs that we find ourselves\nnaturally impelled to hold? \" And he would continue to argue his\ncase as follows. \" This is precisely the relation which I find to exist\nbetween Theism and the whole system of my moral beliefs. Duty\nto me is as real as the physical world, though not apprehended in\nthe same way ; but all my apparent knowledge of duty falls into\nchaos if my belief in the moral government of the world is conceived\nto be overthrown.\"\nHis position, then, may be summed up as follows. We cannot make\nan intellectually coherent system out of the data of sense-perception\nunless we interpret them in terms of certain general principles, such\nas the Uniformity of Nature and the Law of Universal Causation,\nwhich go beyond them and cannot be proved inductively from them.\nWe cannot make an intellectually coherent system out of the data\nof our moral intuitions unless we interpret and supplement them in\nterms of Theism, which also cannot be proved from them. Now the\nlatter data are as indubitable as the former, the demand for intel-\nlectual coherence is the same in both cases, and the principles re-\nquired are not self-evident or capable of proof in either case. Logi-\ncally and epistemologically there is complete parallelism. Either\nwe have no right to make the postulate in either case or we have\n\f156 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\nan equal right to make it in both. The one position which cannot\nbe defended is to make the postulates demanded by science, and\nthen, in spite of or even because of this, to refuse to make the\npostulates demanded by morality.\nSome further very interesting information about Sidgwick's re-\nligious beliefs and doubts is contained in the letter of May 1881 to\nJ. R. Mozley, which I have already quoted, and in another letter of\n1890-1891 to the same correspondent, who had showed him some\nletters from Cardinal Newman. In the former communication Sidg-\nwick says that he is not prepared to admit that the experience of\nChristians that prayers for spiritual help are often answered is an\nadequate ground for believing in the objective reality of a sympathis-\ning and answering Spirit. He also makes the following important\npoint. We must distinguish, he says, between the following three\nquestions : (i) Has Christianity in the past been beneficial or indispens-\nable to human progress? (ii) Is it so nmo and is it likely to be so in\nfuture ? (iii) Is it true ? He thinks that there is very little logical con-\nnexion between the second and third of these questions. He would\nbe prepared to admit that, if it could be shown that Christianity would\nalways be indispensable to human progress, this would be a prima\nfacie ground for thinking it likely to be true. But he sees no reason\nto believe that it always will be indispensable ;\nthough he is inclined\nto think that, if a general belief in it were to break down now or in\nthe immediate future, the results would be disastrous.\nIn the second letter to Mozley he sums up his attitude to Christ-\nianity as follows. Some form of optimism is indispensable for pro-\ngressive humanity as a whole, though not for every progressive\nindividual. The theistic form of optimism is the most attractive and\nintelligible for most people. There is no adequate rational basis for\nany form of optimism ; and so the theistic form is, in this respect,\nno worse off than any other. He thinks that theism will survive,\nbecause it is needed ;\nand, if it does so, it will be because of the\nsupport which it still obtains among Euroj)eans from the traditional\nbelief in Christianity. For his own part, Sidgwick says, he \" has\ntaken service with reason and has no intention of deserting \". But\nhe confesses that, if he yielded to his hankerings after optimism, it\nis likely that the last exercise of his reason would be to submit him-\nself to the authority of the Church of Rome. If he were to submit\nhimself to a^iy external authority, he would have no hesitation, on\nbroad historic grounds, in choosing the Roman Church.\nOne more quotation, this time from a note \u2022which Sidgwick wrote\nin 1895-1896 to Lord Tennyson about his father's In Memoriam,\nmust be given as illustrating his reflexions at the end of his life on\n\f156] Henry Sidgtvick and Psychical Research 157\ntlie religious controversies of his early manhood. In the sixties, he\nsays, men were absorbed in struggling for freedom of thought in the\ntrammels of an historical rehgion. Now i\/wi struggle is over. \"Free-\ndom is won, and what does freedom bring us to? It brings us face\nto face with atheistic science. The faith in God and immortality,\nwhich we had been struggling to free from superstition, suddenly\nseems to be in the air ;\nand, in seeking for a firm basis for this faith,\nwe find ourselves in the midst of the '\nfight with death '\nwhich In\nMemoriam so powerfully presents.\"\nWe have now before us a fairly clear picture of Sidgwick's religious\nstruggles and their outcome. Most intelligent and conscientious\nEnglishmen of his generation went through similar struggles, but\nhardly any of them came out by the same gate as Sidgwick. Some\ntook the path which Sidgwick tells us he was tempted to follow,\nand elected to \" open their mouths and shut their eyes \" and swallow\nwhatever the Pope might give them. A few, such as Frederic Harri-\nson, who wanted the jam of Catholicism without the powder of\nChristianity, joined the Comtist Church, at one of whose reunions\nHuxley found \" three persons and no God \". Many more, of whom\nHuxley himself and W. K. Clifl^ord were the most distinguished\nexamples, found spiritual satisfaction in a kind of revivalistic Agnos-\nticism accompanied by much vigorous banging of the ethical tam-\nbourine. (Cliftbrd's solemn excommunication of the eminent scien-\ntists who wrote the Unseen Universe, and the exquisitely pompous\nex cathedra pronouncement \" The world is made of atoms and ether,\nand there is no room in it for ghosts \", may still be enjoyed as perfect\nexamples of what Jeremy Bentham called \" nonsense on stilts\n\"\nand may still be used as warnings against attaching too much weight\nto the pontifications of contemporary scientific pundits.) Others,\nagain, contrived to muddle themselves into a kind of Hegelian\nChristianity, in which everything turned into its opposite, and\nMaterialism and Mentalism were resolved into a higher synthesis\nin the glow of which one felt it to be crude and ungentlemanly to\nraise concrete questions about historical events and contemporary\nphenomena.\nIt is noteworthy that all these exits, except the ever-open atri\njanua Ditis which Sidgwick was tempted and declined to take, are\nnow utterly out of date and closed to contemporary men. It is\ninconceivable that any intelligent and instructed Englishman at the\npresent day should find a solution of his religious or philosophical\nperplexities in Comtism, in revivalistic Agnosticism, or in Hege-\nlianised Christianity. This suggests that Sidgwick's insight was\ndeeper and his purview wider than those of his contemporaries, since\n\f158 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [pakt\nthey prevented him from accepting those solutions which satisfied\nso many of them and which can now be seen to have been delusive.\nBut, it may be said, Sidgwick's own attitude (it cannot be called a\n\" solution \") is just as much dated and just as impossible for our-\nselves as the alternatives which he rightly rejected. I shall make\nno attempt to discuss this very large question as a whole ; but I\nwill conclude my paper with some remarks on that part of it which\nis specially relevant to our subject, viz., the connexion between\nSidgwick's religious and philosophical position, on the one hand, and\nhis interest in psychical research on the other. In what follows\nI shall be stating my own opinions, and I shall be doing so dog-\nmatically for the sake of brevity ; but I believe that Sidgwick would\nhave accepted them, in outline at any rate, and that a good case\ncould be made out for them.\nThe physical data supplied by normal sense-perception and the\nmental data supplied by the introspection and observation of normal\nwaking persons are the bases on which the whole system of natural\nscience, including psychology, is built. In this vast coherent system\nthere is not a single fact to suggest that consciousness ever occurs\nexcept in intimate connexion with certain highly specialised, com-\nplex, and delicate material systems, viz., the brains and nervous\nsystems of living organisms. There are innumerable facts which\nshow that, during the life of an organism, the nature and' degree of\nconsciousness associated with it vary concomitantly with the general\nhealth and the special physiological processes of that organism. If\nwe confine our attention to this aspect of the case, we receive an\noverwhelming impression that consciousness is utterly and one-\nsidedly dependent, both for its existence and for its detailed mani-\nfestations, on brains and nervous systems and on processes in them.\nWhen the philosopher comes to reflect on what the scientific\nspecialist tends to ignore while he is engaged in his professional\nbusiness, viz., the fact that the human individual is not only an\nobject to be observed but is also the experimenter who devises\ntests and deliberately carries them out and the theorist who specu-\nlates and infers, he finds it very difficult to fit the two aspects of\nthe whole into a single consistent picture. He also notices that no\nscientist, even when occupied in doing his professional work, ever\nregards himself or his colleagues for an instant as \" conscious auto-\nmata \". Plainly there is some very thin ice with some ominous\ncracks in it.\nStill confining our attention to perfectly normal phenomena whose\noccurrence no one would question, we notice that each of us, beside\nperceiving, acting upon, and thinking about the external world of\n\f156] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 159\nmaterial things, is constantly engaged in reflecting upon the actions,\nthoughts, desires, and emotions of himself and his fellow-men, and\nin making judgments about them which involve such predicates as\n\" right \" and \" wrong \", \" good \" and \" evil \", \" valid \" and \" in-\nvalid \", \" true \" and \" false \". Such judgments are organised into\nmore or less coherent systems with characteristic principles of their\nown, which are formulated in ethics and in logic. These facts about\nhuman nature are not particularly easy to unify with that \" con-\nscious automaton \" view of it which seems to be forced on us when\nwe confine our attention to the aspects which are studied by the\nnatural sciences.\nAt this stage we may, perhaps, be emboldened to put the following\nquestion to ourselves. Need we feel the sHghtest surprise at the\npalpable inadequacy of the account of human nature supplied by\nnatural science? Natural science is concerned only with the data\nof human sense-perception, and, for most purposes, only with the\ndata supplied by the two senses of sight and touch. Even within\nthis extremely limited region there is a further selection. It deals\nonly with a normalised extract from the visual and tactual sense-\ndata of normal waking men. Quite rightly, for its own purposes,\nit ignores the peripheral and the abnormal, the sense-data of dreams,\nof delirium, of persons under hypnosis, and so on. Since men are\nnot merely sensitive beings, and since their peripheral and abnormal\nsense-data are just as genuine as their central and normal ones, why\nshould one expect that an account of human nature based exclusively\non this extract from an extract will be adequate ? Echo, so far as\nI can judge, answers Why\"?\nSo far, it seems to me, we can get without going beyond common-\nsense reflexion on universally admitted facts and without making\nany appeal to ideals or emotions. The next step is as follows. We\nall know that in the past claims have been made by various persons\nto have had supernormal experiences, in which they either gained\nknowledge of ordinary facts under extraordinary conditions or had\nrevealed to them facts about the nature and destiny of mankind\nwhich could not be known by ordinary means. We also know that\nsuch claims are made by or for some of our contemporaries. If such\nclaims related solely to the remote past, and if there had been no\nindependent reason to question the adequacy of the account of\nhuman nature based on natural science, these stories might reason-\nably have been dismissed with a smile or a sigh. But, in the actual\nsituation, there is a clear call to investigate such claims with scrupu-\nlous care when they are made by those of our contemporaries, who\ncannot be summarily dismissed as knaves or fools. If any such\n\f160 Professor C. D. Broad, Litt.D. [part\nclaims by them should survive investigation, we may have to view\ncertain stories about the past with a less sceptical eye.\nSuppose, now, that we should find, as a result of our investigations,\nthat some at least of the claims to supernormal knowledge of ordinary\nfacts are valid. This would not, of course, have any direct tendency\nto show that any human mind existed before or will exist after the\ndeath of its present body. Indeed, as members of the S.P.R. know\nfull well, it may weaken the force of arguments for that conclusion\nbased upon mediumistic communications. Nevertheless, it would\nhave an indirect bearing on the question of pre-existence and sur-\nvival. For a great part of the difficulty of any argument in support\nof this conclusion is the enormous weight of antecedent improb-\nability which it has to overcome. Now this antecedent improb-\nability is largely dependent upon the belief that every known activity\nof the human mind in life is correlated point to point with some\nprocess in the brain and nervous system. If the occurrence of extra-\nsensory perception were established, we should have positive em-\npirical grounds for doubting this assumption. Our view of the nature\nof the human mind and its relation to its organism would be pro-\nfoundly modified, and this modification might well reduce the ante-\ncedent improbability of its existing in the absence of its present body.\nWe come now to the last step, and here, for the first time, there is\na reference to ideals and aspirations. It seemed to Sidgwick, and\nit seems to me, that, unless some men survive the death of their\nbodies, the life of the individual and of the human race is \" a tale\ntold by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing \". I\ncannot understand how anyone with an adequate knowledge of\nphysics, biology, psychology, and history can believe that mankind\nas a whole can reach and maintain indefinitely an earthly paradise.\nSuch a belief is a sign of amiability in the young ; but of imbecility,\nignorance, or wilful blindness in the mature. I am not suggesting\nfor an instant that survival is a sufficient condition of any great\ngood ; it is obvious that the world might be infinitely worse with\nit than without it, as it would be if, e.g., the majority of men survive\nonly to be tortured unendingly in Hell. All that I maintain is that\nit is a necessary condition if the life of humanity is to be more than\na rather second-rate farce. I do not desire to survive myself ; so\nfar as I can judge, it would be an immense relief to me on purely\nselfish grounds to be assured of mortality, and I am not altruistic\nenough to bother very much about the fate of the rest of the human\nrace in my absence. But Sidgwick was a man of noble character\nand high ideals, with an overmastering sense of duty and the courage\nto face suffering and unpopularity in doing what he believed to be\n\f156] Henry Sidgwick and Psychical Research 161\nright. That such a man should strongly desire survival for himself\nand his fellow-men, as the conditio sine qua non of the seriousness\nand worth of human life, was inevitable. And it was natural that,\nin desiring it, he should seek for evidence of it in the one corner in\nwhich it seemed to him that evidence might still conceivably be\nfound.\nI suppose it is inevitable that some clever fool should triumphantly\nremark that the fact that Sidgwick approached the subject from this\nangle and with these desires discounts the value of his work in\npsychical research. It should be a sufficient answer to point out\nthat in fact Sidgwick reached a purely negative conclusion about\nthe evidence provided by psychical research for human survival.\nAnd, if I may pass from the particular to the general, I would con-\nclude with the following observation. A conscientious and critical\nperson who realises the immense importance of human survival is\nmuch more likely to weight the scales against 'priiria facie evidence\nfor it than to accept such evidence lightly. His desire that it may\nbe true, and that it may be proved to be so, will indeed make him\npersevere and constantly return to tlie attack after each set-back\nand disappointment. This effect it did have on Sidgwick. But he\nwill be so anxious lest his desires should trick him into accepting\nfairy gold that he will be in some danger of rejecting real gold if it\nshould ever be offered to him.\n\fSOME RECOLLECTIONS OF HENRY SIDGWICK\nBy Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S.\n[These recollections, written some time ago, have little direct reference\nto psychical research. But, after seeing Professor Broad's paper, it\noccurred to me that they might help to make up for the lack of personal\ncontact with Sidgwick which he regrets. I am glad to have the con-\ncurrence of several prominent members of the Society's council in this\nview.]\nHenry Sidgwick was my uncle by marriage ; and he was a familiar\nfigure to me from my earliest years. But sympathetic though he\nwas, I do not think that children particularly appealed to him or\nhe to them. I never heard whether it was a disappointment to him\nto have had none of his own. The only incident that comes strongly\nback to me is that we thought his stammer a grown-up affectation\nand one to be imitated : which we did to his face!\nIt was, however, when I went up to Cambridge as an under-\ngraduate that I first really got to know and appreciate him. Mrs\nSidgwick was at that time principal of Newnham, and they kept\nhouse in a flat there. It was always open to me, and I dined with\nthem alone there several times a term. Mrs Sidgwick was by tem-\nperament a sympathetic listener rather than a talker, and she often\nfell into this role while he and I discussed things. No doubt at first\nmy ideas were too crude, and my stock of knowledge too small to\ndraw him out to advantage. But this partly mended itself with\nlapse of time.\nMoreover, one of his salient characteristics was to make the very\nmost of whatever companionship circumstances might offer. Thus,\nat the time I am speaking of, Mrs Sidgwick was \" at home \" once a\nweek at tea time to the Newnham students. Many of them were\nextremely shy, and to keep the conversational ball rolling was not\naltogether an easy matter. Sidgwick was conscious of this, and said\nthat when there was a difficulty in finding a conversational opening\nwith a young lady, the longer the pause the more important he felt\nthe remark ought to be, so that this embarrassing silence tended to\nbe maintained indefinitely. Outside observers, however, formed a\nvery different impression. As soon as Sidgwick entered the room\nit seemed to them that any embarrassment vanished like smoke.\nThe group within range of him at once became animated. Everyone\nwas at ease and expanded quite naturally with a sense of their own\n(usually latent) social gifts.\n162\n\f[PAUT 156] Some Recollections of Henry Sidgwick 163\nThe secret of Ms success was in great part that he got really\ninterested in the topics which interested his companion and entered\ninto them with zest, however remote they might be from his own\npursuits. Thus about the time I am speaking of (1894), the safety\nbicycle with pneumatic tyres was a novelty and became a fashion-\nable craze. Many guests brought their bicycles for week-end parties.\nTalk at country houses often turned on the different makes of bicycles,\nand their constructional details\u2014not that these were discussed with\nany real engineering knowledge. Sidgwick was not a bicyclist him-\nself, and I remember him saying that he felt left out in the cold\nwhen such topics came up : could anyone recommend him a book\nwhich would supply these deficiencies?\nThis trait of universal interest in whatever interested other people\nwas so striking that it once led me to ask him whether anyone ever\nbored or irritated him. \" Well, yes,\" he said, \" if I make my remarks\nand cannot get anything in reply there is a temptation to that.\"\nThe subject of priggishness came up, and Sidgwick committed\nhimself to the statement that he had never met a prig! I attempted\nto shake this position by citing a fellow undergraduate whom I had\nheard holding forth in the Sidgwick's drawing-room a few days before\nin a way that seemed to me singularly priggish. But he would not\nhave it, and insisted that he had enjoyed the youth's conversation\nenormously.\nThese were various aspects of his tendency to make the best of\npeople. He was temperamentally anxioiis that everyone should have\na hearing. I implied once that some scientific heretic had not estab-\nhshed a claim to be heard. Sidgwick was annoyed by my attitude,\nwhich I daresay was crude enough, and rephed in a tone which for\nhim was rather severe :\n\" He asks for attention, not to his authority,\nbut to his arguments.\" The same spirit showed itself when he re-\nceived from some paradoxer an elaborate attempt to upset the\nNewtonian system of mechanics. Anyone of note in the academic\nworld is likely to receive communications of this kind occasionally,\nand the reply is usually (I imagine) of the briefest. In Sidgwick's\ncase the subject was quite outside the hne of his own studies, and\nthis circumstance would have given him a perfectly satisfactory and\ncourteous line of defence. But he did not avail himself of it. He\nasked a distinguished Newnham mathematician to comment on the\nletter in detail, and forwarded her observations. We may feel pretty\nsure, however, that his trouble was wasted. Anyone who was\nsensible enough to profit by a reply of the kind which he sent\nwould hardly have failed to reahse that his views were worthless\nbefore he submitted them to strangers.\n\f164 Lord Rayleigh [part\nIt was during the time when I enjoyed the privilege of his intimacy\nthat Christian Science first began to 1)e talked of. His attitude\ntowards it was one of sympathetic enquiry. That attitude was not\n(and is not) common in academic circles ; and Cambridge was some-\nwhat scandahsed to learn that a lady who had won very exceptional\nacademic honours had become a convert. Sidgwick was, as is well\nknown, a protagonist of the Women's Movement, but it had many\nopponents ; and one of them attacked him in conversation, pointing\nto what he considered to be the collapse of one of its boasted suc-\ncesses. Sidgwick was proud of his reply. \" Are you aware \", he\nsaid, \" that the President of the British Association is a Christian\nScientist?\n\"\nSir Douglas Galton, the eminent sanitary engineer, was here\nreferred to. Sidgwick attempted, either personally or through\nthe Society for Psychical Research (I am not sure which) to elicit\nfrom him some detailed statement of his views ; but without\nsuccess. Galton replied to the effect that the matter was too\npersonal and sacred to hun to admit of discussion in an academic\nspirit.\nThis brings me to the subject of Psychical Research.\nWhen the Memoir of Henry Sidgtvick by A. S. and E. M. S.\nappeared in 1906, some reviewers noticed that in the part of the\nbook deahng with his later years comparatively little reference was\nmade to psychical research ; and they drew the conclusion that\nSidgwick had become disillusioned on this matter, and regretted\nthe time and attention he had given to it. Such was by no means\nthe case. His interest was undiminished, though like other workers\nin this direction he probably felt that he was not destined to see\nthe problems he had worked at finally resolved. His conviction of\nthe reality of telepathy was the principal definite fruit of his labours.\nIn saying this I am of course speaking from his own subjective point\nof view. The consensus of learned opinion has certainly not reached\nthis point, though (unless I am mistaken) it is slowly approaching\nit. It may be remarked in passing that a revolution in thought of\nthis kind is not usually, if ever, accomplished by the pundits of the\nolder generation changing their minds ; but rather by their passing\naway, and being replaced in the seat of authority by men of the\nnext generation who think diff^erently.\nThe most discussed psychical topics at the time I have been\nwriting of were the physical phenomena occurring in the presence\nof the Italian medium, Eusapia Paladino. Sidgwick's great gifts\nwere not such as to qualify him particularly for experimental in-\nvestigation. He would doubtless be as strong as anyone on the\n\f156] Some Recollections of Henry Sitlgwick 165\npurely logical side ; but experimenting is a craft, and the physical\nphenomena in question require for their investigation a kind of\ncunning in the devising of practical expedients, and an intuition as\nto the possibilities of deception, which he knew well were not his.\nHis bent was not in any degree mechanical.\nI never personally had the opportunity of seeing one of Eusapia's\nseances. She was entertained at F. W. H. Myers's house at Cam-\nbridge, and was, by all accounts, a somewhat difficult guest. It was\nfound important to keep her in a good humour, and Sidgwick took\nmuch of the burden of this on his shoulders. Her only language\nwas Italian, and he struggled manfully to make the most of such\nknowledge of it as he had.\nThe result of the Cambridge seances was disappointing, and most,\nif not all, of the experimenters were convinced that systematic fraud\nwas practised by the medium. They themselves were not unpre-\npared to meet guile with guile. Dr Richard Hodgson, an experienced\ninvestigator who was skilled in the resources of trickery, was intro-\nduced by Sidgwick as \"an old friend \", and without explicit state-\nment the idea was subtly suggested that he was valued more in that\ncapacity than for his brains. In this way the medium was put off\nher guard, with illuminating results.\nNo more was heard of Eusapia for a time. But presently reports\nof further marvels occurring in her presence reached this country\nfrom the Continent. I remember being present one day when\nFrederic Myers came in full of eager interest in these, and anxious\nto resume experiments with her. But his enthusiasm met with a\ncold douche from Sidgwick. After listening at length to what Myers\nhad to say, he gave his verdict. \" I cannot see any reason for\ndeparting from our deliberate decision to have nothing further to\ndo with any medium whom we might find guilty of intentioned and\nsystematic fraud.\" Myers, whose eagerness had by that time been\nconsiderably cooled, found little to say in reply.\nOne of Sidgwick's traits was a pronounced anti-militarist tendency.\nWhen after the Omdurman campaign. Lord Kitchener came to Cam-\nbridge to receive an honorary degree, some enthusiastic young\nwoman said that he was her hero. When Mrs Sidgwick mentioned\nthis, Sidgwick remarked that he did not think it heroic to mow\ndown savages with machine-guns\u2014it might be necessary, but that\nwas the best that could be said of it. He was not tempted to think\nof himself as a man of action, \" Knowing \", he said, \" that I have\nno physical courage, I always hope that I have moral.\" His own\nestimate of his physical courage need not however be taken at its\nface value.\n\f166 Lord Rayleigh [part\nDuring the Boer War his attitude certainly verged on the anti-\npatriotic. He considered the action of this country indefensible,\nI think on the general ground that the Boers had retreated to the\nTransvaal in order to get away from British rule, and that if British\nsubjects had followed them there they did so at their own risk, and\nmust put up with such legal and pohtical status as the Boer govern-\nment chose to accord. I do not remember how he dealt with the\nrather technical questions about British suzerainty which were in-\nvolved. Mrs Sidgwick did not see eye to eye with him on this\nsubject, and when he discussed it she was sometimes perceptibly\nirritated\u2014a rare event indeed with her.\nAs the campaign proceeded, with very indifferent success to the\nBritish army, he took a gloomy view of the ultimate prospects. The\nfollowing entry in the visitors' book at TerUng bears witness to this,\nand was probably the outcome of a somewhat heated discussion :\nChristmas 1899.\n\" Edward Strutt bets Henry Sidgwick a thousand to one in pennies\nthat there is not an indej^endeut Dutch Republic in South Africa\nwithin 5 years.\n(Signed) Henry Sidgwick.\nEdward Strutt.\"\nI do not think Sidgwick went so far as to wish ill-success to the\nBritish armies. Certainly he did not, like his friend Oscar Browning,\nspeak of \" us \" meaning the Boers.\nSidgwick not infrequently told anecdotes about the mentality of\nhis childhood, and the general impression they gave was that he\nmust have combined an earnest sense of duty with complete trust\nin what he was told by superior authority.\nThus he used to tell the story of how he began to learn Euchd.\nImpressed with what he had gathered from his immediate seniors\nof the difficulty of the subject, he determined to grapple with them\nbefore it was officially required of him and learnt several propositions\nby rote, apparently without any conception of what they meant.\nWhen his teacher discovered this and explained to him that that\nwas not the way to learn Euchd, he burst into tears at the thought\nthat all his effort had been wasted.\nHe used to dwell on the rude shock he had received when he learnt\nthat \" Benefit of clergy \" had meant in effect that clergy might\ncommit crimes with impunity for which laymen would be punished.\nSometimes, too, he would talk of his undergraduate days, but I\nam ashamed to find how small are the gleanings which I can now\nset down. He would tell how on one occasion reading mathematics\n\f156] Some Recollections of Henry Sidgwick 167\nand classics alternately (he was reading for a double degree) lie suc-\nceeded in getting in fourteen hours of work in the day. \" But \",\nhe said, \" I could not resist the temptation to spend the next day\ngoing round to my friends and telling them about it, so that the\naverage was soon reduced to seven hours.\"'\nI gathered from this and other hints that his method of reading\nhad not been of the severely methodical order, with rigidly fixed\nhours and unflagging attention. \" You were with your books,\" he\nsaid. \" If you were tired of reading you smoked a cigarette or looked\nout of the window.\"\nThen there was a glimpse of the formidable Dr Whewell, Master\nof Trinity, on his way to the university sermon. According to his\ntheory it was the duty of members of the university to attend it,\nand chancing to meet Sidgwick going in the opposite direction he\ngave expression to his views. \" What did you do? \" I asked. \" I\nwas not prepared to surrender my liberty of action,\" rephed Sidg-\nwick, \" but I tried to look impressed.\"\nThere were many stories current in Cambridge of Sidgwick's hons\nmots in conversation. It was alleged, but upon the whole not\ncredibly, that he used his stammer intentionally to give dramatic\neffect to them. Certainly however it was no disadvantage, for the\npoint gained by being waited for with a moment's suspense. It is\ngreatly to be regretted that there was no Boswell to record his\nsayings\u2014and the attempt to collect them after so many years cannot\nhave much success. However, here are a few.\nIt is related that the characteristics of Canon (afterwards Bishop)\nGr. F. Browne were under discussion. Someone remarked that he\nwas not open to the reproach of losing his temper.\nSidgwick :\n\" No, b-b-but he rather obviously keeps it.\"\nSidgwick on Cambridge values, told me by the late Bishop Charles\nGore : \"If you want to stand really well with Cambridge, three\nthings are necessary : that you shouldn't be known outside the\nUniversity ; that you should not know anything outside your own\nsubject ; and that you shouldn't write your own language grace-\nfully.\"\nIt must not be supposed from these examples that he ever allowed\nhimself to be cynical or unkind. They perhaps represent the limit\nof severity which he allowed himself, unless he felt that condem-\nnation was really called for.\nI remember once suggesting as a psychological experiment telling\na story without any point to see how people would take it (the sug-\ngestion was doubtless crude and stupid, but it must be remembered\nin excuse that I was only a boy).\n\f168 Lord Rayleigh [part\nSidgwick : \"I have tried it. I remembered when I was half-way\nthrough the story that the point was at the expense of a near relation\nof someone who was there. So I left it out. But they laughed all\nthe same.\"\nSelf :\n\" You showed great presence of mind.\"\nSidgivick :\n\" No, I cannot claim that. If I had invented another\npoint, that would have been something to be proud of.\"\nAs a matter of fact, however, his readiness was extraordinary.\nA good example of it is told me by Lord Balfour. Sir William\nHarcourt lost his seat at Derby at the general election of 1895, and\none Green-Price offered, or was said to have offered, to retire in his\nfavour.^ On this being read out across the breakfast table, Henry\nSidgwick remarked immediately, \" Well, it remains to be seen which\nhalf of his name will be justified this time.\"\nAgain, when some purist queried the word reliable (perhaps on\nthe ground that it should be rely-on-able) Sidgwick remarked :\n\" The\nprejudice against the word is unaccountable and even laughable :\nfor the word, though not indispensable, should be generally avail-\nable.\"\nApart from his spontaneous sayings, which were often so good\nthat they were widely repeated, Sidgwick keenly enjoyed hearing\nor telling a good story. He was poles apart from the superior person\nwho only sees in such a \" chestnut \". I give one that I have heard\nhim tell, partly for its own sake, partly because it may help to give\nan idea of his lighter side.\n\" The best example of spontaneous wit I ever heard \", he\nsaid, \" was in the Trinity combination room, when a senior\nfellow was talking in a rather extravagant way, and turning\nround to one of his juniors said, '\nMy young friend here will bear\nme out.' '\nYes ', he rephed, '\nCertainly I will. There is a good\nprecedent for it.' We are told that the young men bore Ananias\nout!\n\"\nAt times he did not hesitate to descend to elementary forms of\nhumour. He would repeat a good limerick with keen relish. One\nstory that he used to tell against himself ran thus. He had formed\na good resolution that when an idea or inspiration occurred to him,\nhe would not let it slip by, but would write it down at once, so that\nit should not be lost. In the night he thought he had such an\ninspiration. Conquering his tendency to slumber, and his natural\nreluctance to leave the warmth of his bed, he got up and made a\nnote of it. In the morning he remembered the incident vaguely,\n1 The offer does not appear to have been accepted, since he took a seat\nvacated by Cornelius Marshall Warmington, K.C.\n\f156] Some Recollections of Henry Sidgwick 169\nand looked eagerly to see what he had recorded. He read as\nfollows :\nSomethnes on one leg,\nSometimes on two.\nSomething to think of,\nSomething to do!\nHe thoroughly enjoyed the theatre, which always seemed to put\nhim in excellent spirits. I remember walking through Piccadilly\nCircus with him after a performance, and I made some unfavourable\ncomment on the moving illuminated signs displayed there. But he\nwould not agree and maintained that \" They add a distinct pleasure\nto life.\"\nHis autumn holiday was usually spent at his brother-in-law's\nhome at Whittingehame in East Lothian. In the circle there his\nviews were always eagerly listened for on any domestic or foreign\ncrisis in national affairs : they were sure to be ingenious and original,\neven if they did not carry complete conviction.\nIn the afternoons he appeared in another aspect. Garden golf\nwas in fashion, and though only a very moderate performer, he got\nwildly enthusiastic and skipped about hke a child in his excitement\nover the game. His long grey beard and the clerical wideawake hat\nwhich he always wore made the effect the more ludicrous. Billiards,\ntoo, he enjoyed enormously, though he was incredibly bad, having\nno notion whatever of the game, but no false shame about his\nincompetence.\nIt was over a game of lawn tennis, however, that I saw him for\nthe only time momentarily angry. There was some question about\nwhether a ball served was a fault or not. Sidgwick said that he saw\nthe dust fly (from the whitewashed line). His opponent, not clearly\napprehending the conclusiveness of this evidence, or perhaps not\nimderstanding what had been said maintained his position. Sidg-\nwick may have thought that his veracity was questioned. His eyes\nflashed with anger, and he said, Very well, but I shall avoid playing\nwith you again.\" But he instantly accepted an apology, and I am\nsure never gave the matter another thought.\nI say that this is the only time I saw him angry : but though\nI never happened to witness it, I know that any selfish attempt to\nencroach on public rights moved him strongly to anger. Witness\nthe following told by himself. He was sitting in a railway carriage\nand two persons of the opposite sex got in. One said to the other\nin a loud aside, \" I am sure the gentleman will have too much good\nfeehng to smoke in the presence of ladies.\" Are you aware \", said\n\f170 Lord Rayleigh [part\nSidgwick, \" that this is a smoking carriage? \" and the attitude being\nmaintained he dehberately took out a cigarette and ht it as a protest.\nSidgwick's studies in metaphysics and ethics were quite outside\nmy ken, and I knew httle of PoHtical Economy. I was, however,\ncontemplating some study in the latter for the Trinity Fellowship\nexamination. Candidates were allowed to name the books on which\nthey wished to be examined, and I asked Sidgwick's advice. He\ndiscussed the matter at some length, but somewhat undecidedly.\nSeveral books were suggested or dismissed. At last I said, \" You\nhave not mentioned your own book.\" The reply was characteristic.\n\" Well, no, I have recently been going over it for a new edition, and\nthe truth is that I find it so very dull that I cannot honestly recom-\nmend it.(!)\n\"\nAs I recall this conversation I picture his study at Newnham, a\nsmallish square room with walls entirely covered with books. There\nwas a desk at which he would stand upright, reading or perhaps\ncorrecting proofs. The pendant electric lamp had been conveniently\nbrought over it by an extemporised arrangement in which Mrs\nSidgwick's hand might be traced\u2014one knew instinctively that his\nwas not the mind that had conceived it. The writing table at which\nhe sat was covered with an incredible quantity of papers in disarray.\nThis accumulation periodically overflowed into the drawing-room\non the other side of the passage, where it was deposited on the\nwriting table designed for the use of visitors. At this stage Mrs\nSidgwick usually took action and a clearance was effected with her\nhelp. Apropos of this Sidgwick recalled a discussion which he had\nheard on how a murderer should dispose of the corpse of his victim.\n\" I should put it among the papers on Sir 's writing table \" was\nthe suggested solution. \" I think there would be cover for a small\ncorpse on mine,\" he said.\nSocial intercourse and the exercise of hospitahty were to Sidgwick\nkeen pleasures. At the same time he had a definite ethical objection\nto luxurious expenditure. He used to tell how, at one time, he had\nunder the influence of this feeling, severely simpUfied the enter-\ntainment at his dinner parties, cutting off the champagne or other\nexpensive wine, and generally reducing it below the prevaihng\nstandard. But an unforeseen difficulty arose. He felt the need\nunder these circumstances of making it up to his guests by added\nconversational brilliance ; and the strain of this weighed so heavily\nupon him that he abandoned the effort and went back to the cham-\npagne! I think as a matter of fact that he appreciated good things\nand enjoyed them when he could do so without a feehng of personal\nresponsibility. The cooking at Newnham wa.s not above criticism,\n\f156] Some Recollections of Henry Sidgwick 171\nand I have known him goaded into strong protest on the subject.\nMrs Sidgwick said practically nothing in reply.\nHis ethical scruples had no apphcation in cases when he was clear\nthat comfort added to efficiency. I asked if he was in the habit of\ntaking a sleeping car south from Scotland. \" Yes,\" he said with\ndecision, '\"\nI always take one. Life is not long enough to allow one\nto waste the next day by want of rest.\"\nAs may be read in detail in the Memoir, Sidgwick was a leader\nin the Women's Education Movement in Cambridge, Newnham\nCollege having been in large measure his creation. In 1895-6 it\nwas felt that the time had come to move in the direction of securing\nthe degree for women ; it was found in practice (though the\nopponents of the movement could not or would not believe it)\nthat the lack of a titular degree put women who had passed the\nstandard at Cambridge at a disadvantage compared with womea\nfrom other universities to whom the titular degree was granted.\nHowever, the attempt was not at that time successful. Party feel-\ning ran high on the subject. Among other incidents a committee\nof undergraduates approached the Vice-Chancellor and asked whether\nthey might present a memorial against granting the degree, and\nthey were given a favourable answer. Sidgwick was much incensed\nat this. When the subject came up in conversation, and it was\nsuggested that the tmdergraduate leaders were unjustified in inter-\nfering, I remarked that it seemed to me that they were whitewashed\ni\nby the official reception of their memorial. Sidgwick was silent.\nWhen appealed to he said, \" I quite agree. The undergraduates\nought to have been told it was not their business. If I were to say\npublicly what I think, it would not conduce to peace. In a few\nyears I shall resign my Professorship and then I shall say some plain,\nwords on that and other subjects.'' The failure of the movement\nwas a deep disappointment to him, and he said wearily that he\nintended to give up trying to influence university opinion. The\nwork was too much uphill.\nAlthough in this particular matter he was a strong partisan, he\nwas sometimes criticised for sitting too much on the fence. Thus,\nat a committee meeting on some question of university administra-\ntion, the chairman observed him twisting his beard and showing\n'\nsigns of mental activity, and said, \" Professor Sidgwick, do you\nwish to say anything about this proposal?\n\"\nSidgivick : \"I was p-p-pursuing a train of thought which might\nlead to an objection.\"\nSidgwick's sympathetic and unselfish nature showed itself in many\ndirections, but nowhere more strongly than in his interest in the\nI\n\f172 {Lord Rayleigh [part\nhopes and aspirations of the younger generation. Any freshman\nwho through old family friendship or otherwise had a claim on his\nnotice was sure to be asked to dine, and cordially received ; and\nif in any case the friendship failed to ripen, the fault certainly was\nnot Sidgwick's.\nHe had, however, a rather unfortunate shortcoming in never\nrecognising a passer-by in the street, and this was often misunder-\nstood. Many people assumed that he had decided that conventional\ngreetings were tiresome and that it was better to avoid them.\nHowever, I reproached him on one occasion with never recognising\nme, and he clearly failed to realise that there was any truth in the\ncharge.\nHe always seemed to estimate the capacities of his young friends\non a generous scale ; and if they seriously failed to make good when\nit came to the ordeal of a Tripos examination, it was a shock to him.\nHis natural reaction in such a case was to consider whether the\nuniversity system was not at fault rather than the young man whom\nit had judged adversely. Perhaps this was partly due to his in-\nstinctive sympathy with the weak when at issue with the strong,\npartly to the vein of unorthodoxy that ran through his whole\ncharacter.\nI do not remember to have discussed rehgious behefs with him,\nl3ut his views are set forth in the pubhshed Memoir. A few casual\ngleanings may be mentioned. I have heard the present Archbishop\nof Canterbury quote in an after-dinner speech his remark :\n\" Bishops\nindividually represent everything that I find most agreeable ; col-\nlectively, everything that I most detest.\" That (it seems) was what\nhe thought of bishops, and it will serve to introduce what a dis-\ntinguished bishop^Charles Gore\u2014thought of him. He spoke of\nHenry Sidgwick as coming as near as any man he knew to the\ncharacter described in the text \" Blessed are the pure in heart.\"\nAsked whether he regarded Sidgwick as a Christian, he said he\ndid, and referred to the passage in the New Testament ^ on the two\nbrothers, one of whom said, \" I go \" and went not, and the other\nsaid, \" I will not go \" and went.\nIn the summer term of 1900 I was in residence at Cambridge as\nusual, working in the Cavendish Laboratory. I dined with the\nSidgwicks quietly once or twice at the beginning of term, but then\nfollowed a long interval without my hearing from them. It crossed\nmy mind as a httle odd, but I knew of no reason to attach special\nimportance to it. Doubtless, I thought, they have not happened to\n' Si-. Matthew xxi. 28-30.\n\f156] Some Recollections of Henry Sidgwick 173\nhave a suitable day free. Then came a letter from Mrs Sidgwick\nasking me to come and see them on an appointed afternoon. I did\nso, and Mrs Sidgwick told me, simply and bravely, the dreadful\nnews. Sidgwick had had symptoms to which he had not attached\nspecial importance, but (I think at her insistence) had consulted a\nspeciahst, who pronounced that he had a mortal disease. An opera-\ntion would be necessary almost immediately, but could not avert\nthe ultimate result. Possibly a year or two of invalid life might\nremain in which he might be able to wind up the literary work\nwhich he had on hand.\nI saw him for a moment after the interview with her. There was\nnot a shade of difference from his usual cheery manner.\n\" Well, you have heard how it is with me,\" he said. \" You see\nI beheve in science ; I am submitting to this operation though I\nfeel perfectly well.\"\nThe next and last time I saw him was a month or two later at\nTerhng, my own home. He had gone there to recruit, as was hoped,\nafter the operation. But the result was far otherwise. I was sent\nfor one day to his room. The change in him was terrible, and it was\nevident even to my inexperienced eye that the end could not be far\noff. He said that he had not strength for a long interview, but that\nhe had sent for me because he wished to hear how my scientific\nwork was going on. I told him what I could with a feeling however\nthat the insignificant details of my efforts were quite out of place\nin face of the awful change that was impending. But it was like\nhim to be thinking of the intellectual interests of another even at\nthat time. He wished me good-bye, and hoped for my success in\nthe immediate object of my ambitions. A few days later he was\ngone.

Mitchell, M.D.\nFrom the earliest times it has been believed or suspected that in the\ntreatment of disease something more than physical or material\nmeans is necessary or desirable. Attempts to cure bodily or mental\ndisorders arose in connexion with religious and magical practices.\nWhen primitive man was stricken with illness he cried for some divine\nintervention or some magical gesture that would restore him to\nhealth. It was thought that all disease was due to the malign\ninfluence of gods or devils and could be counteracted only by prayer\nand propitiation, or that it was due to the agency of less powerful\nspirits or other human beings whose evil influence could be annulled\nby magical rites. The world of primitive man was a world of spiritual\nagencies which had to be reckoned with in every form of human\nexperience, and it was long before the concept of physical causation\nin a natural world supplanted the supernaturalism inherent in\nanimistic beliefs.\nUp to the eighteenth century the occult influences operating in the\ncure of disease were always regarded as being of a spiritual nature,\nbut in the Age of Reason men sought more and more for some\nmaterial or physical source of all such influences whatsoever. But\nas no likely source could be found on earth men's minds turned\nback to one of the oldest of beliefs, namely, belief in the influence\nof the stars on human life. In 1765 a young Viennese student of\nmedicine, Franz Anton Mesmer, wrote a thesis for his Doctor's\n^ This paper was read at a Private Meeting of the Society on October 27,\n1938.\nK ]75\n\f176 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PABT\ndegree, on \" The Influences of the Planets on the Human Body \".\nHe thought that the heavenly bodies exerted a direct influence on\nall living creatures by means of a subtle fluid which emanated from I\nthem. This fluid he considered to be of the nature of magnetism\nand for a time he used magnets in the treatment of his patients.\nLater he believed that a similar influence could be transmitted\nthrough his own touch or even by passing his hand over the patient\nwithout contact. The force which he believed emanated from his\nown body in this process he called Animal Magnetism. Strange\neffects and marvellous cures were brought about by his methods, and '\nhe soon found himself opposed by the medical profession and\ndenounced as a charlatan by the whole world of science. But his\nviews and his methods were adopted and successfully applied by his\ndisciples, and to be treated by animal magnetism or mesmerism, as\nit came to be called, was for a time a fashionable craze.\nWhen James Braid, a Manchester surgeon, in 1845 showed that\nthe mesmeric state could be brought about without the use of any\nso-called mesmeric passes, and without any belief in a magnetic\nfluid, the way was opened for the rise of what we now know as the\nTheory and Practice of Hypnotism. Braid got his first results by\nasking the patient to fix his gaze on some bright object held in front\nof his eyes, and when this process was found to induce sleep Braid\nthought that this was due to neuro-muscular fatigue caused by the\nfixed gazing. Later he came to realise that the essential feature in\nhis method was the suggestion of sleep implicit in his technique.\nBut the full development of the theory of suggestion as the essential\nfactor in the induction of hypnosis and its accompanying phenomena\nwas the outcome of later researches, mainly those of Liebault and\nBernheim, the founders of the so-called Nancy School.\nAlthough we now know that Braid discovered in suggestion what\nis believed to be the essential factor in the induction of the mesmeric\nstate, acceptance of his teaching was very tardy. His views were\nopposed, not only by many medical men but also by the mesmerists ;\nthey would not admit that the hypnotic state was the same as the\nmesmeric state. Moreover they maintained that what were called\nthe \" higher phenomena \" of mesmerism, e.g., clairvoyance, could\nnot be obtained by Braid's methods.\nThe whole subject of mesmerism and hypnotism and their relation\nto one another remained confused and controversial for many years.\nThe old belief that magnetism had some connexion with the pheno-\nmena lasted for a long time, and even as late as 1880 Charcot was\nusing magnets to produce effects of various kinds on his hysterical\npatients. It was in an age of mingled scepticism and credulity con-\n\f157] Psychical Research to Psychotherapeutics 177\ncerning these matters that the Society for Psychical Research was\nfounded in 1882. The founders of the Society thought the time\nopportune \" for making an organized and systematic attempt to\ninvestigate that large gTOup of debateable phenomena designated by\nsuch terms as mesmeric, psychical, and spiritualistic \". A special\ncommittee was formed for \" the study of hypnotism, and the forms\nof so-called mesmeric trance with its alleged insensibility to pain ;\nclairvoyance, and other allied phenomena \". On this committee\nwe find the names of Edmund Gm-ney, Frederic W. H. Myers. Frank\nPodmore, Sir William Barrett, and other less well-known men.\nMost of the research work of this committee was inspired and\ncarried out by Edmund Gurney.\nTo appreciate fully the importance of Gurney's writings on\nhjrpnotism it is necessary to bear in mind the attitude of men of\nscience towards hypnotism and mesmerism in the year 1882 when\nthe Society for Psychical Research was founded. All the well\nattested facts of mesmerism, the profound anaesthesia induced by\nEsdaile in India, the many genuine phenomena observed and\nrecorded by Elliotson in England, were derided by the whole\nscientific world. The reality of the mesmeric state was denied\nbecause the existence of the magnetic fluid was thought to be dis-\nproved by Braid's demonstration that a similar state could be brought\nabout in the absence of all mesmeric manipulation, xlcute contro-\nversy arose between the mesmerists and the hypnotists, but in the\ncourse of years it died down, and after the death of Braid and\nElliotson interest in the subject waned to such a degree that in\nEngland there was no scientific investigation into the rival claims of\nthe mesmerists and the hypnotists until Gurney began his work in\n1882. As Frederic Myers said of him : \"he was the first Englishman\nwho studied with any kind of adequate skill the psychological side of\nhypnotism, making therein experiments\u2014cut short, of course, by\nhis premature death, but already of the highest value\u2014experi-\nments which, though sometimes concurrent with those of the French\nSchool, were yet independently executed ; and which mark, as it\nseems to me, an epoch in the study of hypnotism in England\n\"\n(Proceedings, SP.R. IV, p. 365).\nIn his early work on this subject two problems specially occupied\nGurney's attention. The first question he tried to answer was : Is\nthe hypnotic state ever induced by some yet unrecognized agency\n\u2014\nsome specific influence of operator on subject ? Long after suggestion\nhad been recognised as the efficient cause of hypnotic state, \" passes\n\"\nwere still used in its induction, and both Gurney and Myers were\ninclined to believe that there was some evidence found in the course\n\f178 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nof their experiments to justify the claims of the mesmerists in this\nmatter.\nMyers thought that Gurney's experiments proved \" that there is\nsometimes in the induction of hypnotic phenomena some agency at\nwork which is neither ordinary nervous stimulation (monotonous or\nsudden) nor suggestion conveyed by any ordinary channel to the\nsubject's mind \". The chief form of experiment on which this\nconclusion was based was described by Gurney as follows :\n\" The\n'\nsubject ' is made to put his arms through a thick screen, extending;\nhigh above his head, and to spread his ten fingers on a table in front\nof him. The fingers are thus completely concealed from his view,\nand the operator's hand is held, without contact, at a distance\nvarying from about a third to three-quarters of an inch, over one or\nanother of them\u2014according to my selection\u2014with the result that\nin a very large majority of cases, the finger so treated, and that\nfinger alone, becomes rigid, and insensible to extremely severe\ntreatment in the way of stabs, burns and electric shocks \".\nAlthough Gurney and Myers stressed the importance of further\ntesting of these results by other observers, little interest in their\nwork was shown ; for under the growing influence of the French\nSchool the conviction became general that suggestion was the sole\nand sufficient cause of all hypnotic phenomena.\nSome further experiments, recorded l^y Mrs Sidgwick and Miss\nAlice Johnson, in 1890 {Proceedings, S.P.R. Vol. VIII) corroborated\nGurney's results, but these observers arrived at a different conclusion,\nas to how these results were brought about. They thought that the\nrigidity and anaesthesia were due to suggestion conveyed tele-\npathically from the operator to the subject. They were further of\nopinion that their experiments disproved Gurney's hypothesis of a\nphysical efliuence directed by the concentrated will of the operator.\nThis subject was again brought before the Society in 1920 by the\nlate Dr Sydney Alrutz, Lecturer in Psychology in the University of\nUpsala, and he described some experiments performed by him which\nconvinced him of the reality of a nervous effluence such as Gurney\nhad postulated. After Dr Alrutz's death, his methods were demon-\nstrated, by his assistant, to a group of psychologists at the eighth\nInternational Psychological Congress at Groningen in 1926, and a\nreport of this demonstration by Dr Van Loon and Dr Thouless\nappeared in Proceedings (Vol. XXXVI). These experiments were\nnot successful, and all those before whom they were demonstrated\nagreed that \" the results obtained point to the ordinarily accepted\ntheory of suggestion in hypnosis as an adequate explanation of all\nthe phenomena observed \".\n\f157] Psychical Research to Psychotherapeutics 179\nAlthough this problem of an unrecognised agency in the induction\n\u2022of hypnosis occupied Gurney's mind from the beginning, he soon\nturned his attention to the psychological phenomena of hypnotism\n\u2014\na sphere in which he did much work of outstanding value. His most\nimportant contributions to our knowledge were his papers on \" The\nStages of Hypnotism \", \" The Problems of Hypnotism \", \" Stages\nof Hypnotic Memory \" and Hypnotism and Telepathy \".\nThe occurrence of different stages or degrees of hypnosis, and the\nmemory relations of these stages to each other and to the waking\nconsciousness, present some of the most perplexing features of trance\nstates, whether arising spontaneously or artificially induced. Al-\nthough Janet, in France, was at this time occupied with these\nproblems, Giu:ney\"s work was begun independently and was set forth\nin a series of contribution to our Proceedings, the first of which\nappeared a few months after the publication of Janet's first paper.\nAlthough so little attention had been paid to hypnotism in England\nsince Braid's time, there had been several investigators on the\nContinent, but their observations and experiments were little known\nin this country. Grurney's experiments, therefore, were received with\nincreduhty and few realised that he was laying the foundations on\nwhich the psychology of abnormal mental states during the next\ntwenty years was to be based.\nMost of the experimental work was devised and carried out by\n\u20acrurney, but the theoretical imphcations of his results was more\nparticularly the task undertaken by Frederic Myers. Partly derived\nfrom Grurney's experiments, partly from Janet's clinical observa-\ntions and partly from his own studies on various forms of automatism,\nMyers put forward a view of the nature of hysteria which was far\nin advance of the teaching of Enghsh cUnicians. Wilham James,\nwriting on Myers' service to Psychology, said :\n\" Myers' work on\nautomatism led to his brilliant conception, in 1891, of hysteria. He\ndefined it, with good reasons given, as a '\ndisease of the hypnotic\nstratum '. Hardly had he done so when the wonderfully ingenious\nobservations of Binet, and especially of Janet, in France, gave to this\nview the completest of corroborations. These observations have\nbeen extended in Germany, America and elsewhere ; and although\nBinet and Janet worked independently of Myers, and did work far\nmore objective, he nevertheless wHl stand as the original announcer\nof a theory which, in my opinion, makes an epoch, not only in medical,\nbut in psychological science, because it brings in an entirely new\nconception of our mental possibilities \". [Proceedings, S.P.R. XVII,\nIt is interesting at the present day to recall that the first citations\n\f180 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nbrought forward by Myers in support of his views were from Breuer\nand Freud's epoch-making paper on \" The Psychical Mechanism of\nHysterical Phenomena \". After giving a brief abstract of this paper\nMyers said : \"I could not wish for a more emphatic support, from\nwide clinical experience, of the view of hysteria to which my own\nobservations on different branches of automatism had already, by\nmere analogical reasoning, directed my thought.\"\nAs is well known, Freud's views on Hysteria have undergone a\ngreat development since those early days, but there is nothing in his\nearlier work that is opposed to his theories of to-day. Would that\nwe had to-day a Frederic Myers to evaluate those theories and to\nincorporate them in a new study of Human Personality.\nBesides the early work of Gurney and Myers there were in later\nyears many important contributions on this subject by medical\nmen who were members of the Society for Psychical Research and\nwhose earliest writings appeared in our Proceedings. Dr Lloyd\nTuckey, one of our members, was one of the first men in England,\nafter Braid's time, to resume the use of hypnotism in medical\npractice. Dr Milne Bramwell also joined our Society and contri-\nbuted many important papers to our Proceedings. By his forceful\npersonality and his courage he did more, perhaps, than any man in\nour time to compel the medical profession to consider the claims of\nhyj^notic suggestion as a therapeutic method.\nAlthough the therapeutic side of hypnotism was by no means\nneglected in the work of the Society\u2014indeed the seemingly myster-\nious influence implicit in the records of \" hypnotic \" cures was one\nof the primary interests of its founders\u2014nevertheless, experimental\nwork was that to which the pages of Proceedings were most freely\nand appropriately open. The original records of one series of\nexperiments, namely, experiments on the Appreciation of Time by\nHyjDnotic Sonmambules, are to be found, exclusively I think, in our\nProceedings.\nAlthough all experimental work on hypnotism has bearings on\ntherapeutics, it is, however, in relation to psychopathology that its\nresidts are most enlightening. Knowledge of the peculiarities of\nhypnotic memory proved very helpful in the study of the conditions\nknown as Double and Multiple Personality. This topic came into\nprominence through the work of Pierre Janet and other French\nobservers, and although Gurney and Myers had Httle opportunity\nof studying such cases at first hand, Myers, after Gurney's death in\n1888, made an exhaustive examination of all the available records,\nand was convinced of the importance of such studies for a true\nunderstanding of the workings of the mind. His conclusions were\n\f157] Psychical Research to Psychotherapeutics 181\nexpounded in many papers in our Proceedings and were ultimately\nincorporated in his great work on \" Human Personality and its\nSurvival of Bodily Death\n'\n'\n.\nSome of these cases of double personality were recorded for the\nfirst time in our Proceedings, for example the case of Ansel Bourne,\nreported by Richard Hodgson ; but wheresoever these stories were\nrecorded the earlier cases were very fully summarised and com-\nmented on by Myers, and later ones by other members of the Society.\nThe interest of Psychical Research in these pathological records\nwas largely due to the many similarities observed between the mani-\nfestations of multiple personality and the phenomena of medium-\nistic trance. The main problem was to discover the true nature of\nsecondary personalities, and whether all secondary personalities had\nthe same origin. The secondary personalities of the French cases\nwere obviously formed by a massive splitting of the mind, by what\nwas called a disaggregation or dissociation of consciousness. Restora-\ntion to the normal state was achieved by bringing about a reunion\nof the split-off portions. Occasionally, however, it was found that\none of the secondary personalities failed to become incorporated in\nthe restored personality\u2014which was presumably the full normal self.\nFor example, in the Beauchamp case recorded by Morton Prince,\nthere seemed to be no representative of the personality Sally in the\nrestored Miss Beauchamp. As Morton Prince enigmatically said,\nSally went back to \" where she came from \". Some investigators\nare tempted to believe that in cases of this kind we have examples\nof invasion by an extraneous spirit similar to that which they beheve\noccurs in mediuniistic trance. Thus, in the Doris Fischer case,\nrecorded so fully by Dr Walter Prince, the personality \" Sleeping\nMargaret \" claimed to be a spirit, and Dr Prince and Dr Hyslop were\nof opinion that her claim was justified.\nMany psychologists who have studied such cases deny the neces-\nsity of ascribing to these personalities any origm different from that of\nsecondary personalities due to splitting of the self, nor do they admit\nthat the personalities known as \" controls \" in mediumistic trance\nhave any other origin. They do not admit the spirit hypothesis,\neven in those rare cases of so-called \" personal control \" in which\npossession of the entranced medium by an extraneous spirit would\nappear to afford the readiest explanation of the observed phenomena.\nThe best critical study of this problem is to be found in Mrs Sidg-\nwick's important monograph on \" The Psychology of Mrs Piper's\ntrance \" {Proceedings, S.P.R. Vol. XXVIII).\nIt might be supposed that in raising the c^uestion of sp rit posses-\nsion we are passing beyond the territory common to both Psycho-\n\f182 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\npathology and Psychical Research ; but in view of the opinion of so\nacute a critic as Mrs Sidgwick that all mediumistic controls are but\nsecondary personalities or impersonations at the hypnotic level of\nconsciousness, we are perhaps justified in regarding all such pheno-\nmena as part of the subject matter of psychopathology. In so doing\nwe imply nothing either directly or indirectly about the related topic\nof the supernormal acquisition of knowledge, with which we are not\nnow concerned.\nIn the early years of the twentieth century the part played by\nMedical Psychology in Psychical Research became so considerable\nthat the Council of the Society for Psychical Research decided to\nform a Medical Section of the Society and to publish at intervals\nspecial medical parts of Proceedings. Part 66, Vol. XXVI of Pro-\nceedings, was the first, and the last, special medical part that was\nissued ; for in 1914 the war came, and after the war the medical\nsection of the Society for Psychical Research was discontinued for\nreasons which I will briefly explain.\nThe revival of psychotherapeutics in England may be said to date\nfrom 1905, when a Society for the Study of Suggestive Therapeu-\ntics, afterwards called the Psycho-medical Society, was formed in\nLondon. From an earlier period there had been in existence an\nassociation of Academic Psychologists called the British Psycho-\nlogical Society. During the war some well-known members of this\nSociety who held medical qualifications, such as Dr W. H. R. Rivers,\nDr Charles S. Myers and Dr William Brown, had been engaged in the\nArmy Medical Service, and had done much psychotherapeutic work\namong soldiers suffering from so-called \" shell shock \". When the\nwar was over the British Psychological Society decided to form\nvarious sections within the general framework of the Society, and a\nMedical Section, with a large membership, was the first to be formed.\nIt published a quarterly journal. The British Journal of Medical\nPsychology, and as it was thought that all psychotherapeutic and\npsychopathological interest would now centre in this new organisa-\ntion, the old Psycho-medical Society and the Medical Section of the\nSociety for Psychical Research were discontinued, as it was felt\nthat they could serve no further useful purpose.\nAlthough the activity of the Medical Section of our Society thus\ncame to an end we still continued to publish in our Proceedings\ncontributions from medical psychologists on the various topics to\nwhich I have referred, namely, mesmerism, hypnotism, multiple\npersonality and the psychology of trance states in general. But as\ntime went on it became plain that since the war the very foundations of\nmedical psychology, on which we had built for over twenty years, had\n\f157] Psychical Research to Psychotherapeutics 183\nbeen shaken by the work of Professor Freud and his pupils. Interest\nin hypnotism and its phenomena waned and its use by medical men as\na therapeutic agent was gradually abandoned in favour of some\nform of mental analysis based on the discoveries of Professor Freud.\nAlthough the bearing of these discoveries on Psychical Research\nwas by no means clear, we welcomed any light on our problems that\nthe analysts could give us. It was about this time that Freud's\nwork came to be generally known about in this country, and we asked\nhim to contribute a paper on his use of the word unconscious\n\"\nin his writings. He very kindly sent us a \"Note on the Unconscious\n\"\nwhich was published in Proceedings and subsequently in his \"Collected\nPapers \". In this paper he told us \" what the term '\nunconscious\n'\nhas come to mean in Psycho-analysis and in Psycho-analysis alone \".\nIt is diflhcult at the present day to recapture the atmosphere in\nwhich the early teachings of psycho-analysis were received in this\ncountry thirty years ago, but those who can do so will understand\nwhy a paper on \" The Psycho-analysis of Suggestion and Hypnosis\n\"\nwhich we received from Ferenczi, a well-known Hungarian psycho-\nanalyst, was not published in our Proceedings. It was thought in-\nadvisable to do so in a lay publication because of the attitude of\npublic opinion at that time towards Freud and his work, and with\nFerenczi's consent his paper was handed over to the Psycho-\nmedical Society and was published in its Transactions.\nWith the general adoption of analytical methods in the treatment\nof psycho-neurotic illness the interrelations of psychical research\nand psychotherapeutics became less obvious, and at the present\ntime we cannot say that the researches of one department of know-\nledge have much bearing -on those of the other. But there will\nalways remain some common ground\u2014the realm of the unexplained\n\u2014in which discoveries may be made in one field of investigation or\nthe other. That there is a realm of the unexplained in the history\nof mental healing cannot be denied.\nThat there is some unknown force at work in the healing of the\nsick, in addition to the ostensible means employed, is a belief that\ncan be traced from the beginnings of history up to the present day.\nThis force has been interpreted in various ways, sometimes as divine\nor magical influence, sometimes as an occult physical or mental\ninfluence emanating from the healer, sometimes as merely faith on\nthe part of the healed. Belief in the existence and efficacy of such\nforces is still widespread at the present day. Although civilised man\nmay have given up the beliefs of the savage in respect to the causa-\ntion of disease, there still linger in the depths of the mind the\ndeposits of ages of what we presume to call superstition, and a\n\f184 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [past\ncraving for some manifestation of supernatxiral power that will cure\nliim as the forefathers of his race were cured.\nThe advice of the prophet, given at second hand through a\nmessenger, \" Go and wash in Jordan seven times \" seemed to Naa-\nman a poor way of treating leprosy. He was wroth and went away\nand said, \" Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and\nstand, and call on the name of the Lord his Grod, and strike his hand\nover the place.\" The leper missed the personal contact with the\nhealer. What he was told to do was too simple, too commonplace ;\nthere was no incantation, no magical gesture, no appeal to a divine\npower. There was no special virtue or charm, he thought, in the\nwaters of Jordan. \" Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damas-\ncus, better than all the waters of Israel? ... So he turned and went\naway in a rage.\"\nEven when material remedies were accepted and used in the treat-\nment of disease, belief in the part played by spiritual agencies was\nslow to disappear, and when spiritual agencies as understood by\nprimitive man were finally dethroned, agencies of a hidden nature\nwere still beheved in. When Socrates was asked by Charmides about\nhis cure for headache, he rephed that \" it was a kind of leaf, which\nrequired to be accompanied by a charm, and if a person would repeat\nthe charm at the same time that he used the cure, he would be made\nwhole, but that without the charm the leaf would be of no avail \".\nFurther he said : \"If the head and body are to be well, you must\nbegin by curing the soul ; that is the first thing. And the cure . . .\nhas to be effected by the use of certain charms, and these charms are\nfair words.\"\nLet us return to modern times and ask if there is any unknown\nforce, any \" charm \", in the therapeutics of to-day. It is commonly\nadmitted that what is vaguely spoken of as \" the personality of the\nphysician \" plays an important part in ordinary medical treatment^\nand it is widely held that the influence thus effected is in some way\nrelated to the influence of suggestion in psychotherapy. But how\nsuggestion ever acts to produce curative results is just one of the\nunsolved problems that we have to consider.\nIn the days of the later mesmerists much stress was laid on the\nrapport which became estabUshed between the patient and the\nmesmerist, and this was ascribed in some unexplained way to the\nmarvellous attributes of the magnetic fluid. A similar rapport,\nhowever, was found to exist between the hypnotist and the hypno-\ntised person when no mesmeric methods were used in the induction\nof hypnosis. There have been many attempted explanations of the\npeculiar relation of the hypnotised subject to the hypnotiser, but\n\f157] Psychical Research to Psychotherapeutics 185\nnone of them is quite satisfactory. Dr McDougall ascribes all\nsuggestibility and hypnotic rapjJort to the rousing of the instinct of\nsubmission by one who has prestige in virtue of some quality or\nsupposed quaUty that renders him imposing to the person whom he\ninfluences. Freud compares hypnosis to the state of being in love.\nHe says :\n\" The respects in which the two agree are obvious. There\nis the same humble subjection, the same compliance, the same\nabsence of criticism, towards the hypnotist just as towards the loved\nobject.\"\nHere then, in the abihty to arouse feelings of submission or of\nlove, may perhaps be found the \" charm \" without which suggestion\nis of no avail. But although we may have found the key to suggest-\nibility, that is to say, why a therapeutic suggestion is accepted so as\nto become efiicacious, we stUl do not know how it acts.\nThe control by suggestion of organic process over which we have\nno voluntary control is as mysterious to us now as it was in Mesmer's\nday. It is an aspect of the mind-body relation of which we can give\nno explanation either physiological or psychological. I do not think\nanyone understands how such results are brought about. They are a\nform of obedience or compliance which neither the instinct of suh-\nmission, nor love, nor fear can account for. Thus notwithstanding\nall our experience of suggestion and the effects that it can produce\nwe must still acknowledge the activity of some unknown force\nbehind its manifestations.\nSuggestion dehberately employed has produced so many seeimngly\nmiraculous cures that we are perhaps too ready to ascribe to sugges-\ntion all so-called miracles of healing, without being sure that no other\nforce may be at work. There are on record, both in the past and in\nthe present, so many instances of alleged miracles of healing in\nwhich, if we light-heartedly dismiss them as being due to nothing\nbut suggestion, we are perhaps missuig some unknown factor, the\nreality and importance of which may some day be acknowledged.\nNo sounder advice was ever given to scientific investigators than the\ndirection to \" examine your residues \". If in alleged cases of\nmiraculous healing, whether \" spiritual healing \", \" faith heahng \",\nor any form of curing the sick that recalls to our minds the so-called\nsuperstitions of the past\u2014if, in investigating these cases we find any\nresiduum of unexplained phenomena, it is our duty to search with\nunbiased minds for any unknown factor that may be involved.\nTo do so is a duty of obedience to the teachings of the history of\nscience, and it is a lesson that has often been taught us in the practice\nof Psychical Research. We need to avoid the intellectual arrogance\nwhich misleadingly assumes that we know far more about the nature\n\f186 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nof things than we actually do, just as we must avoid all enthusiasms\nthat would tend to pervert our intellectual judgments. Nowhere\ndo we find the pernicious effects of such enthusiasms more clearly\ndisplayed than in the hasty rej ection of new truths which happen to\nbe opposed to our beliefs and prejudices, or in the uncritical accept-\nance of beliefs that fulfil our wishes.\nThe lesson to be learnt from all our work in Psychical Research, as\nit seems to me, is this : the need to keep a suspended judgment\nwhenever we encounter new facts or new theories that do not fit\ninto our accepted scheme of things, or that too readily satisfy our\nhearts' desires.\nTo many of you, I feel sure, such a Laodicean attitude will not\nappeal : to me it is the very essence of the scientific spirit.

By her niece Ethel Sidgwick.\nSidgwick and Jackson, Ltd., London. 12s. 6d. net.\nMembers of tkis Society will hardly need to be reminded of the\ndebt it owes to Mrs Sidgwick. Although she did not join the Society\nimtil 1884, two years after its foimdation, she may be counted one\nof its founders in all but the narrowest sense of the word, and no\none did more than she to shape the Society's course, or contributed\nmore to its achievements during the first 50 years. The earliest of\nher own papers \" Phantasms of the Dead \" appeared in Proceedings\nin January 1885 ; her last was a History of the Society, written on\nthe occasion of its Jubilee in 1932, when she was eighty-seven years\nold. Between these two dates she contributed constantly to Pro-\nceedings and took a large share (in collaboration with Henry Sidgwick\nand others) in such important pieces of research as \" Phantasms of\nthe Li\\Tng and the Census of Hallucinations \"'.\nThere is no field in which Mrs Sidgwick's personal quahties were\nmore apparent than in psychical research, her human sympathy and\ndesire to help people in any way she could, her meticulous acciu:acy,\nher infinite capacity for taking pains, her willingness to embark on\nany task, however long, duU and immediately unprofitable it might\nbe, if there was the shghtest hope that at the end of it the sum of\nknowledge might be increased, her clear and impartial judgement on\nmatters of evidence, and last but not least, her unswerving determin-\nation to follow truth wherever it might lead her.\nIn Chapter VI of I\\Iiss Sidgwick's book, entitled \" Newnham and\nBeyond \", the author traces the gradual development of Mrs Sidg-\nwick's opinions on the question of human survival and the possibihty\nof communication with the dead from the doubt of early days to-\nthe conviction pubhcly annoimced by her brother, Lord Balfour, at\nthe Jubilee Meeting :\n\" Conclusive proof of survival is notoriousljr\ndifficult to obtain. But the evidence may be such as to produce\nbelief, even though it fall short of conclusive proof. ... I have Mrs\nSidgwick's assurance\u2014an assurance which I am permitted to convey\nto the meeting\u2014that, upon the evidence before her, she herself is a\nfirm believer both in survival and in the reaUty of communication\nbetween the hving and the dead.\"\nWhere proof is unobtainable, conviction must always be to some-\nextent a personal matter, but it may fairly be said that no one had.\n\f188 Review [part\na better right to conviction on this particular issue than Mrs Sidg-\nwick, for no one has ever raade a more complete and careful study\nof all available evidence, or is less hkely to be led astray by prejudice\nor emotional bias.\nIn addition to her contributions to research, Mrs Sidgwick played\na large part in the administrative side of the Society's work ; she\nwas not only a Council Member for many years and President in\n1908 and 1909, but she was Honorary Editor from 1888 to 1897 and\nHonorary Secretary from 1907 to 1932.\nA considerable part of ]\\'Iiss Sidgwick's book is naturally concerned\nwith Mrs Sidgwick 's activities in other fields and in particular with\nthe important work she did in the fomidation and development of\nNewnham College. Not only was she Principal of the College from\n1892 to 1910, but from the very earhest days of Newnham almost to\nthe time of her death there was hardly any scheme for the advantage\nof the College in which she did not play a leading part. In this\nfield also, as in j^sychical research, Henry Sidgwick was her constant\ncollaborator, until his death in 1900.\nSeveral interesting and characteristic quotations are given from\nsome of her public speeches. At Liverpool in 1896 she said that it\nwas the privilege of a University to bestow two gifts : one moral\nand one intellectual. The moral gift was \" the sense of membership\nof a worthy community with a high and noble function in which\nevery member can take part \" ; the intellectual gift was the \" habit\nof reasonable self-dependence in thought and study, to whatever end\nthought and study may be directed. I call it reasonable self-depen-\ndence, partly to contrast it with the uncritical acceptance of new\nideas ... to which even persons of strong intellectual interests are\nliable, if they are given over to miscellaneous reading without ever\nhaving made a thorough study of anything. . . . But I equally wish\nto distinguish it from the undue self-confidence and sweeping\ndogmatism sometimes seen in persons who have mastered one\nsubject really well, but have never, by hving and learning among\nstudents who are studying other subjects, imbibed an adequate\nsense of the Hmits of their own knowledge.\" No one exemphfied\nthe value of these intellectual and moral gifts more completely than\nMrs Sidgwick herself.\nHer admirable sense of human values was also shown in the\nlecture she dehvered in the early days of the Great War on \" The\nInternational Crisis We were fighting, she said, against the\nprinciple that might makes right :\n\" Do not let us, then, indulge on\nour side in the very vices we are condemning. How can we hope to\ndiminish hatred in the world if we allow ourselves to feel it? . . .\n\f157] Review 189\nHatred is not, except in a very limited way, a source of strength but\na source of weakness, and if we depend on hatred to enable us to\nwin, we shall lose. . . . The second duty I want to insist on is that\nof not being afraid.\"\nThere are two dehghtful chapters on Mrs Sidgwick's childhood\nand the days before her marriage. It is always difficult to reahse\nthat j^eople we have only known in later hfe were once, hke ourselves,\nvery young, and it is pleasant to have ghmpses of Mrs Sidgwick\nsitting in a beech tree on a Sunday afternoon, or joining with her\nbrothers and sisters to initiate guests at Whittingehame into the\nBalfour customs, which included conducting them \" about the more\nprecipitous parts of the grounds by night.\"\nThe simphcity, not to say austerity, in her personal way of life\nwhich is evident in these early years, remained characteristic of Mrs\nSidgwick to the end. Miss Sidgwick mentions an occasion in 1930\nwhen at the age of eighty-five she travelled alone third class from\nOxford to Dunbar. When she came to the Society's Rooms, she\nhabitually and in all weathers insisted on departing alone by bus\nfor Waterloo, and I well remember the surprise, not to say conster-\nnation, of the Society's officials, when on a bitterly cold day she and\nher sister. Lady Rayleigh (both of them over eighty), appeared in an\nopen car, because they \" hked fresh air \".\nIt is to be hoped that many members of the Society will read this\nbook, not only for its interest in relation to psychical research, but\nalso for the Hght it throws on an outstanding character and person-\nahty, which will always remain a vivid memory to those of us who\nwere privileged to know and to work with Mrs Sidgwick.\nHelen deG. Salter\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 158\nWILLIAM McDOUGALL, 1871-1938\nBy Kenneth Kichmond\nFuture historians of mental science will either hold WilHam\nMcDougall in high esteem or leave his name to sink into oblivion. If\nthe human mind, as represented by scientific thought, conies to the\nconclusion that it is an aimless accident in an aimless world, he wiU\nmerely be one of the old-fashioned thinkers who stood in the way of\nthat conclusion. The thought of the newer, purposeless thinkers\nwill have passed him by, on deterministic tram-rails which have the\npeculiarity of being laid by men with no intention of arriving any-\nwhere\u2014since intention will be out of court as a real factor in human\nprocedure.\nIf, on the other hand, we and the generations that follow us can\nput it beyond scientific question that we are something more than\nmechanically-determined aggregates of physical and chemical\naction, McDougall will stand high among the men of science who\nmaintained the wider view, and upheld it with detailed and com-\nprehensive reasoning. Both in the range of detail, biological and\npsychological, that he has brought into the argument on behalf of\npurpose, and in the comprehensiveness with which he has marshalled\nhis material, he has held a place of his own. Men of greater philo-\nsophical attainment have built completer structures of reasoning\nabout the necessity for an acceptance of mind as a directive agent,\nbut McDougall remains the chief stalwart in his orderly presentation\nof facts that strain to bursting-point any of the mechanistic inter-\npretations of Ufe.\nHis career falls into two divisions, in England until 1920 and in\nthe United States from then until the end of his life, and the space\nL 191\n\f192 Kenneth Eichmond [part\nthat separates the two phases of his work is not merely geographical.\nA Lancastrian by birth and the environment of his boyhood, he\ngraduated at Cambridge, and took his M.B. at St. Thomas's Hospital,\nLondon. But for his war service as an officer in the E.A.M.C., his\nmedical training was to be chiefly an adjunct to his general scientific\nequipment. His Doctorate was in science. His distinguished\nacademic work brought him eventually to Oxford as Wilde Reader\nin Mental Philosophy. He was elected a Fellow of Corpus Christi\nCollege, Oxford, and of St. John's College, Cambridge. His Fellow-\nship of the Royal Society added honour to a position in the scientific\nworld which was becoming increasingly evident in the reception of\nhis pubhshed work.\nFrom his first book, the Introduction to Social Psychology, onwards\nthroughout his writings, it is clear that his thought as a psychologist\ntook full account of man regarded as a social creature. This is not\nthe place to expand the point that a psychology which fails of atten-\ntion to the social behaviour of man is an incomplete psychology,\nbut it is relevant to the appreciation of McDougall's wide humanistic\noutlook that he consistently treated mental life as a fact which has\na social context. He also based cogent arguments for the purposive\ncharacter of life upon the social behaviour of living beings. Body\nand Mind, pubhshed when he was 40, was at once received as a book\nof major importance, and has remamed a standard work. In it he\nmaintained that \" not only conscious thinking, but also morpho-\ngenesis, heredity and evolution, are psycho-physical processes.\"\nAmong the evidence for a psychic constitution in man he included\na chapter on psychical research, in which the following passage\noccur, on cross-correspondences : \"... the keenest critics ofthe view\nwhich sees in these writings the expression of the surviving person-\nalities of deceased persons, are driven to postulate as the only\npossible alternative explanation of some of them the direct com-\nmimication of complex and subtle thoughts between persons\nseparated by himdreds and even thousands of miles ... we stand\nbefore the dilenxma\u2014survival or telepathy of this far-reaching kind.\nThe acceptance of either horn of the dilemma is fatal to the mechan-\nistic scheme of things.\"\nThe mind of primitive man next engaged his attention, and was\nthe subject of published work. War and war-service intervened ;\nand in 1920 he pubhshed The Group Mind, in which social psychology\nis extended into the psychology of nations and nationhood. It was\nin this year that he accepted the Presidency of the S.P.R. and\ndehvered the Presidential address pubhshed in Proceedings, Vol.\nXXXI, p. 105. In this he dealt with the common preference of\n\f158] William McDougall, 1871-1938 193\nscientists to remain in ignorance of psychical researct, and recog-\nnised that they have one motive worthy of respect in the fear of\nopening doors to pubhc superstition. But he showed this motive\nto be mistaken : proper research was \" our best defence \" against\nsuperstition ;\n\" it is the policy of sitting on the lid of the box that\nis risky.\" In personal attitude towards the interpretation of\nphenomena he professed himself \" very decidedly \" of the right wing,\nbut spoke of the importance and the value of both wings, and of\nco-operation between them. The concluding thought m his address,\nthat what may survive is not merely an individual but a social being,\nreflects the shape of his thought in general psychology, and shows\nthe scientific mind that does not entertain a hypothesis without\ntaking it in the round.\nIn this same year, 1920, McDougall was offered, and accepted,\nthe Professorship of Psychology at Harvard University which hr\nheld for seven years. His translation to the American scene w&f\nfollowed, at first, by a change in his writings that aroused son*\nnusgiving among admirers of his thought. He was adapting himself\nto a new audience and a more public environment than that of\nEnglish academic life, and his lectures printed in book form showed\na certain loosening of texture. There seemed to be some fear of the\ndisappearance of a fine psychologist and the emergence of a popular\ninstructor on human nature and world affairs. But he was mean-\nwhile setthng to business, as was presently shown by the appearance\nof two standard works, An Outline of Psychology (1923) and An\nOutline ofAbnormal Psychology (1926). These are well enough known\nto those who make effective use of the S.P.R. library in making\nsure of their psychological groundwork. His Character and the\nConduct of Life (1927) was a popular book in the best sense, and a\nvalued contribution to the psychology of education. Meanwhile,\nhis work in experimental psychology included the labour of con-\nducting a prolonged investigation in the biological field, into the\ninheritance of acquired characters. His plan of experimental\nbreeding, which has now been carried on for 17 years and to the\nfiftieth generation, has produced important evidence in support of\nthe neo-Lamarckian view. This is perhaps the most concrete\nexample of McDougall's way with a scientific dogma of \" It can't\nhappen \". He would go to infinite trouble to make sure of his facts\nand then say, \" It does happen \".\nIn 1927 he became Professor of Psychology at Duke University,\nand it was under his aegis that the formal study of psychical research\nwas instituted there with Professor Rhine as director. For all his\npositive character, McDougall was not the man to impose his own\n\f194 Kenneth Richmond [part\nrule and method upon the growth of younger men's ideas and ex-\nperience, and the new institution flourished with its own vitahty\nand is fighting its own battles. He was much engaged with con-\nstructive criticism of the innumerable branchings of psychological\nresearch and theory that are now claiming attention. This work\nis hardly represented in his last books, The Fro?itiers of Psychology,\nnotable for its wide treatment of the interrelation between the\nsciences. Psycho-Analysis and Social Psychology, containing a\nsearching criticism of the validity of Freudian \" mechanisms \"\nwithout minimising the great value of Freud's discoveries, and\nThe Riddle of Life, the admirable survey of biological theories which\nwas reviewed by Mr Tyrrell in the January issue of the Journal?-\nBut his thought in these last years was much preoccupied by the\ndispersion of psychological progress into so many unrelated channels.\nHe had hoped to see, and to feel that he had played his part in, a\nmassive unification of ideas in psychology. A lifetime of research\nand reasoning had confirmed his conviction that it is vain to build\npsychologies upon less than the whole foundation of psychological\nfact, and that mental aim and striving constitute a psychological\nfact of the first importance. He saw modern psychologies, one after\nanother, as wasting their energies in the attempt to cram psychical\nfacts, piecemeal, into a dubious framework of physical causation,\nand as missing the structure of sound theory by disregarding facts\nessential to structure. It could be said that his last years were\nweighted by a feeling of disappointment and frustration, and with\nthe idea that the comprehensive outlook which he had offered to\nthe psychological world had been widely refused. But he was no\nmartyr to the thought, and went stoically on with the maintenance\nof his constructive standard and the shrewd criticism of imperfectly-\nbased theories. Actually, the structure of his psychological thinking\nstands more securely in the esteem of men than he thought ; and\nas an American colleague has observed, anyone who desires to\neUminate what McDougall found it necessary to assume as to the\nnature of living mind should \" see to it that he covers the tremendous\nrange of behavioural facts with which McDougall continually\nchecked his theory.^\n\"\nWe know from the valedictory message that was printed in the\nJournal last December ^ that this distinguished authority upon the\nmind of man continued to the end of his life to set a high value upon\nthe contribution that psychical research has made and has to make\n1 Vol. XXXI, p. 10.\n^ The Psychological Review, Vol. 46, p. 1.\n3 Vol. XXX, p. 294. \u2022\n\f158] William McDougall, 1871-1938 195\ntowards a comprehensive outlook in mental science. Psychical\nresearch workers owe a debt to William McDougall for his life-work\nin maintaining that outlook, in preserving the essential nature of\npsychology as an open rather than a closed system, and in construct-\ning an open system of psychological thought upon the widest basis\nof factual observation.\n\f196 C. V. C. Herbert [part\nSHOKT EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHS OE A JUMPING MODEL\nBy C. V. C. Herbert\nFrom time to time photographs appear in the press showing a\nmedium at a seance in a state of apparent levitation. These are\ntaken by means of flashlamp bulbs, in some cases the exposure being\nmade by the medium himself by pressing a switch attached to a\nflexible wire. It has been suggested that these pictures iu fact\nrepresent nothing more remarkable than the medium jumpiug from\nthe ground, to which it has been objected that it would be impossible,\nwithout very special apparatus, to produce a photograph of a jump\nwhich did not show considerable blurring due to the movement of\nthe figure. At the suggestion of the President, Lord Rayleigh, the\nSociety produced a series of photographs of a jumping model in\norder that comparison could be made with these alleged levitation\npictures.\nThe procedure was as follows :\n\u2014\nThe model was placed against a black background, as is commonly\nthe case in the seance room, immediately behind him being a screen\non which horizontal white lines were ruled at 50 centimetre intervals.\nThe distance between the screen and the model was approximately\n60 centimetres, though this naturally varied slightly in different\nexposures. The camera was 6 metres away from the model. To the\nright of the model was placed the flashlamp, a large approximately\nparabolic reflector containing a single \" Sashahte \" photoflash bulb\n(General Electric Co.), the distance from the bulb to the model being\n200 centimetres. The model was faintly illuminated by a red\nphotographic safelight, the exposure being made by means of a tele-\ngraph key. To the left of the model and included in the field of the\ncamera was a rotating timing disk, by means of which the length\nof exposure could be approximately measured. The exposure was\nmade on 35-millimetre film (two frames per picture) in a Leitz\n\" Leica \" camera, one operator working the camera shutter and\nwinding the film, while another changed the flash bulbs, checked\nthe sj^eed of the timing disk, and made the exposures by visual\ninspection by the fight of the red lamp. The exposure times varied\nslightly with the different bulbs, but were approximately 1\/100\nof a second.\nIn Plate I the model is seen in position before the jump. Plate II\nshows the jump in progress, the model's head being about 50 centi-\nmetres above the position of rest, as shown by the scale of white\nfines on the backgroimd. Very fittle movement is discernible. For\n\fPLATE I\n\fPLATE 11\n\fPLATE III\n\fI 'I. ATI-: i\\'\n\fPLATE\n\f\f158] Short Exposure Photographs of a Jumping Model 197\nPlate III the model was asked to keep his toes well up during the\njump, resulting in a very easy position in which he seems to be\nhanging in mid air with no trace of movement. The exposure here\nis shghtly shorter than the average, being a little less than 0-01\nsecond. In Plate IV the model is turned sideways to the camera,\nand Plate V shows him with his hands clasped together.\nThe photographs were all taken on the same day, the results not\nbeing seen until some days later. The operators had had no special\nexperience in the jjhotography of moving objects, nor was any\nspecial apparatus used, except for the timing disk, the flash bulbs\nbeing those commonly used at seances.\nIt is suggested that these photographs, especially Plate III, are\nfreer of movement and more suggestive of genuine levitation than\nany of the pubUshed seance-room productions. It is therefore con-\ncluded that it would be quite possible to produce the published\npictures by fraudulent means in any case where the flash was ignited\nby the medium himself or by an accomphce ;\nthough this is not, of\ncourse, in any way proof that they were so produced.\nThe thanks of the Society are due to Mr D. S. Robertson, who\nkindly consented to act as model, and to Miss J. Robertson, who\nwas one of the operators.\nPhotographic details, and a description of the timing disk are\ngiven in the Appendix.\nAPPENDIX\nPhotographic Details :\nLens : Leitz \" Elmar :\",\nf=50 mm.

V. C. Herbert\nMrs Helen Hughes has estabUshed a considerable reputation as a\nplatform clairvoyante at public meetings, and she has also a large\npractice of private Sittings. In her platform work she is especially\ndistinguished by giving a large number of names, both Christian\nnames and surnames, a considerable proportion of which are accepted\nas veridical by the recipients of the messages. This frequent occur-\nrence of names and the general precision of her messages make\ninvestigation of her powers comparatively easy, and do a good deal\nto offset the general difficulties which are always involved in the\nstudy of platform mediums. It is probably true to say that investi-\ngation of Mrs Helen Hughes is likely to be more worth while than\nthat of any other platform clairvoyante who practises at the\npresent time.\nIt was therefore felt that the extremely inadequate data relating\nto Mrs Hughes, which were aU that the Society's files contained\u2014one\nshort note by an investigator who had attended one of her pubUc\nmeetings\u2014ought to be very considerably augmented, and that every\nopportunity should be taken of studying her remarkable powers,\nand of submitting her claims to supernormal cognition to a critical\nanalysis.\nThe procedure at a usual platform demonstration is as follows :\n\u2014\nThe meeting, to which members of the pubhc are admitted free of\ncharge, begins with a speech by the Chairman, which serves to\nintroduce the subject in general and Mrs Hughes in particular to\nthe audience, and gives the medium time to settle down into a state\nof receptiveness, or, as some beUeve, of semi-trance. The speech\nlasts half an hour or so, and as soon as it is over ]\\Irs Hughes begins\nher clairvoyant \" readings \" without further preli minaries. She does\nnot appear to be in an abnormal state : her voice is her usual voice,\nand any condition of trance must be an extremely fight one. It is,\nhowever, recorded that at a recent meeting held last year, ]\\Irs Hughes\nwas seriously affected by a disturbance which was made by a member\nof the audience, who was seized with an hysterical attack in the\nmiddle of the meeting. IVIrs Hughes was unable to continue her\nperformance, and burns or bruises were afterwards found on her\nperson, caused, it is said, by the sudden shock of the interruption.\nThe messages are given in two forms. In one, Mrs Hughes ad-\ndresses the audience at large and says, for example, \" Is there anyone\nL2\n\f200 C. V. C. Herbert [part\nhere called Wilson? \", or \"Is there anybody who knew a Doris\nSmith V If a response is obtained, further information is then given.\nIn the second class of message, a specific person is first selected.\nThe medium says, \" I want to come here\n\u2014\nthat lady \" (pointing at\na member of the audience). When the person's attention has thus\nbeen secured, the message, generally containing names, is delivered.\nIf the recipient disclaims the message, it is sometimes found that\nit apphes accurately to the person sitting on her right or left hand,\nor in the row behind or in front. In nearly every case somebody is\nfoimd who is understood to accept the message, at any rate in part.\nSometimes Mrs Hughes ends by saying, \" Do I know you?\" or \"could\nI have known that normally?\" and the recipient generally says,\n\"No\".\nSome of the messages do not prove to be acceptable to anyone,\nbut the general impression obtained by a member of the audience is\nthat by far the largest proportion are more or less successes. Mrs\nHughes speaks as though her information was obtained by a com-\nbination of clairvoyant and clairaudient perception. She \" sees\n\"\nfigiires \" building up \" near the various members of the audience\nconcerned, and she also \" hears \" messages apparently from an\nxmseen figure standing beside her\u2014she sometimes half turns as\nthough to catch a whispered conversation. The messages are given\nvery quickly with considerable precision. After some twenty\nmessages have been delivered, Mrs Hughes complains that the\n\" power \" is running low, and the proceedings come to an end.\nAt the demonstrations given by the London Spiritualist Alliance,\nwhich body has a monopoly of Mrs Hughes' services, the arrange-\nments are the same, except that the audience is of coiirse much smal-\nler than at the meetings held in a public hall.\nThere can be no question that the vast majority of the messages\ngiven at these performances are more or less correct. To what is this\ncorrectness due? To chance, to normally acquired knowledge, to\nsupernatural cognition, or to information imparted to Mrs Hughes\nby discarnate spirits? These alternatives can easily be reduced to\ntwo, since chance is clearly not a feasible explanation for such\nconsistent successes, and we have no means of differentiating with\nany degree of certainty between supernormal cognition obtained\nthrough incarnate intelhgences and similar information dictated by\nspirits. Our problem, then, is the following : does Mrs Helen\nHughes get her material normally or supernormally? This question\ncan only be answered by studying exact records of what was said\nby the medium, and by obtaining critical statements from the re-\ncipients of the messages. Such an inquiry, so easy at an ordinary\n\f158] Prelimmary I^ivestigation of Platform Clairvoyante 201\nSitting, is a formidable task when large numbers of people, many of\nwhom are members of the public whose names are unknown, are\ninvolved. There is, however, one consolation. By far the most\nfruitful source of leakage at an ordinary Sitting\u2014the giving away\nby the sitter of vital information in response to \" fishing \" on the\npart of the medium\u2014caimot here be operative to any appreciable\nextent. The recipients of messages scarcely speak at all. It is clearly\nimpossible that Mrs Hughes could get her material by normal means\nfrom the recipients during the meetings. Her information, if nor-\nmally acquired, must have been obtained beforehand.\nAs stated above, Mrs Hughes gives a large number of private\nSittings in addition to her platform work. At these Sittings, no\ndoubt, much valuable information must be disclosed by the sitters.\nEven without any conscious \" fishing \" on the part of Mrs Hughes,\nit is certain that inexperienced and imcritical sitters will infalhbly\ntell her a great deal about their private affairs, much of which they\nwill not afterwards remember that they have disclosed. If Mrs\nHughes is able to remember this material and to associate it with\nthe sitter's appearance, then, if the sitter ever turns up at a platform\nmeeting, this information coidd be given back. Many people have\nobjected that such a process would necessitate a feat of memory on\nthe part of Mrs Helen Hughes which, in view of the large number\nof private Sittings which she gives, is altogether impossible. What\nevidence have we that material brought up at a private Sitting is\never used again after an interval at a platform demonstration?\nThere is, of course, the difficulty that even if, say, a veridical Aunt\nJane, mentioned at a private Sitting, again put in an appearance\nlong afterwards at a public meeting, that would be no proof that the\nsecond emergence was based on a memory of the first. It might be\nthe real Aunt Jane who had communicated on each occasion, or\nif the first had been obtained by supernormal cognition from the\nsitter's unconscious, the second might represent a similar but un-\nrelated supernormal cognition. It would be just as though the two\nAunt Jane communications had been obtained through different\nmediunis.\nBut by a great piece of good fortune we have a well recorded inci-\ndent in which memory, normal or abnormal, of a private Sitting\nseems to be the only possible explanation of the facts.\n^\nIt is clear that, in evaluating Mrs Hughes' platform work, we\ncannot take into consideration messages given to persons who have\npreviously had private Sittings with the medium, unless indeed we\nhave before us a full shorthand record of the private Sittings con-\n1 See page 210.\n\f202 V. C. Herbert. [part\ncerned and are thus able to tell exactly what information was dis-\nclosed by the sitter.\nThe first attempt by the Society to deal critically with one of Mrs\nHughes' jjlatform demonstrations was made in connection with a\npublic meeting held at the Caxton Hall on October 24, 1938. It was\narranged that a full shorthand note should be taken, and a number\nof members of the Society attended the meeting and distributed\nthemselves about the hall. These members were instructed to\nnote carefully the people in their vicinity who were given messages,\nand, after the meeting was over, to engage some of them in conversa-\ntion and to find out if possible\u2014(1) if they had had previous private\nSittings with Mrs Hughes, (2) if they had ever before attended\npubhc meetings, and (3) if their friends or relations were known to\nMrs Hughes or had had private Sittings.\nThis last point is of great importance as was shown at a previous\nattempt of the same kind which was made some time ago by Mrs\nGoldney. Mrs Goldney approached a member of the audience at a\npubhc meeting who had received a remarkable message. This\ngentleman declared that he had never had a private Sitting with\nMrs Hughes, nor had he previously attended a platform demonstra-\ntion. It seemed as though a very striking instance of supernormal\ncognition had taken place, as the message was clearly not to be\nexplained by chance, when a lady who had been sitting near the\nrecipient entered the conversation and explained that she had\nrecently attended a private Sitting with Mrs Hughes at which her\nfriend had been mentioned (she could not remember whether it was\nMrs Hughes or herself who had first introduced the topic of this\nfriend, nor could she see that this had any bearing on the matter).\nWhat Mrs Hughes had said was that she must be sure to bring the\nfriend to the platform demonstration, which she accordingly did.\nThe members of the Society who attended the meeting at the\nCaxton Hall were able to interrogate five out of the eighteen persons\nwho received messages. All five had previously been in contact with\nMrs Helen Hughes.\nIt had been announced by the Chairman that any recipient of a\nmessage was invited to leave his name and address with the Secretary\nof the London Spiritualist Alliance, under whose auspices the meet-\ning was held, so that further particulars could be obtained. The\nAlliance very kindly consented to communicate to the Society any\ninformation thus obtained, and also the answers to a questionnaire\nembodying the three points mentioned above, which was sent out\nto those who left their addresses. The questionnaire asked :\n\f158] Preliminary Investigation of Platform Clairvoyante 203\n1 . Have you before attended a public meeting with Mrs Helen Hughes\nand received a description from her ? If so, with what results ?\n2. Have you ever had a private Sitting with Mrs Hughes ?\n3. Have you any friends or relations who have sat with Mrs\nHughes ? ,\nThe London SpirituaKst Alliance received and communicated to\nthe Society replies from eight recipients, three of whom had already\nbeen interrogated by our members after the meeting. In all,\ntherefore, particulars were forthcoming from ten of the eighteen\npersons who were given messages. Of these ten, five had had\nprivate Sittings with Mrs Hughes, one was personally known to her,\nand one had received the same message at two previous platform\nmeetings with this medium. The remaining three are therefore all\nwhose messages we can profitably study in connection with our\nproblem.\nThe first whom we will consider is a gentleman who had not\npreviously sat with Mrs Hughes, though some of his friends had had\nSittings with her. The message is recorded in the shorthand note\nas follows :\nMrs Hughes :\n\" Sir, have you just come or have you ever Hved in\nthe Lake District ?\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" Yes \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" Just sitting in the seat against you is a lady who\nbelongs to you. She says, '\nTell him I am here too, but you would\nalmost think Ehzabeth was comparing the Lake District to London.\nTell him to try again. Get on with your development.' I have to\ntell you from Dr Hawke to go on, and not turn back. He says, '\nHe\nis right this time ' \".\nThe recipient writes as follows :\n\" She was correct in thinking I came from the Lake District. I\ncannot place '\nElizabeth ', but my recollection of that remark was\nthat I was comparing London to the Lake District, and was advised\nto remain where I am, which is to me quite an evidential remark.\nI feel sure she said '\nDr Hall ', not ' Dr Hawke ', and that he advised\nmy going on '\nsitting for development ' . This makes sense , as Dr Hall\nis a near neighbour, who is interested in these subj ects, and sometimes\ndiscusses them with me. He tells me he knows Mrs Hughes, having\n'\nsat ' with her in Edinburgh. ... I know no Dr Hawke.\"\nOne of the members of the Society who took longhand notes gives\nthe salient features of the message as \" Lake District, Elizabeth,\nDr. Hall.\" This supports the recipient's view that it was Hall and\nnot Hawke that Mrs Hughes said.\n\f204 C. V. C. Herbert [part\nThere was here the obvious possibihty that normal leakage might\nhave taken place through Dr Hall, who knew Mrs Hughes and had\nsat with her in Edinburgh. Through the kindness of Miss Philli-\nmore, the secretary of the London Spirituahst Alliance, I was given\npermission to write to the recipient in order to obtain more evidence\non this point. He answered as follows :\n\" Thank you for your letter about Mrs Helen Hughes, which I was\nonly waiting to answer till I heard from Dr Hall.\nHe has now given me a definite denial of ever mentioning my name\nto her\u2014as I knew he would. He is not my doctor, and I do not know\nhim intimately, but occasionally I have been able to lend him books\non these subjects, of which I have a great many.\"\nHow, then, was Mrs Hughes able to associate this recipient with\nthe Lake District, and to connect him with Dr Hall? Chance\ncoincidence is obviously out of the question. Out of a large audience\nit is unthinkable that Mrs Hughes could select someone at random\nand could by luck correctly place him as connected with the Lake\nDistrict, to say nothing of Dr. Hall. The only normal explanation\nwould seem to be that some other friend of the recipient had in a\nSitting with Mrs Hughes conveyed the information that a person\nconnected with the Lake District and with Dr Hall was hkely to\nattend the meeting. But it must be noted that the information\nwould have to be sufficiently detailed to enable Mrs Hughes to\nrecognise the recipient, whom she had never seen, and to identify\nhim from out of a large audience in a pubHc hall. This seems to\nbe highly unlikely.\nIn our next case the recipient was not selected by Mrs Hughes,\nbut responded to a question addressed to the audience at large.\nThe recipient had had no previous connection with Mrs Hughes, but\nshe has been a spiritualist for the last fifty years, so there is certainly\na possibihty that she may have been recognised. The shorthand\nreport is as follows :\nMrs Hughes :\n\" There is an old gentleman here named Levi.\nAnyone know him ?\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" I know Levi \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" There is something strange for him, but he is\nstanding with you. He says, '\nLevi is here ', and someone called\nJohn too. Have you been suffering lately ? Do you know what\nLevi says ? Levi says, '\nTell Nellie we have helped to pull her\nround '. You have been suffering all over your body. Levi says\n'\nTell Nelhe she is all right in our hands, and we will not fail her '.\nDo you belong to Bournemouth ?\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" I know Bournemouth \".\n\f158] Preliminary Investigation of Platform Clairvoyante 205\nMrs Hughes :\n\" There is a lady standing with you who belongs to\nBournemouth \".\nRecipient :\n\" Yes \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" Dr Gilbert and Mrs Meddleson \".\nRecipient :\n\" Yes \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" Did she spend her hohdays with you ?\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" Often \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" She spends her hoHdays now over here which is\nmuch better. Now I hate to say this to you. . . . Have you\ntwins ?\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" No \".\n(Another member of the audience said, \" She is a twin \".)\nMrs Hughes :\n\" Thank you. Did you know the Wolff family ?\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" Yes, very well indeed \".\nMrs Hughes : \"I have to say, '\nTell her we want to let her know\nwe can speak to her ! Don't worry about your health wiU you ?\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" No, I won't, thank you \".\nThe recipient's Christian name is Nellie. She disclaims \" John \",\nand \" Dr Gilbert \", but knows Levi, Mrs Mendelssohn (given as\n\" Meddleson \") and the Wolff family. As regards the latter, she\nnotes :\n\" The lady next to me ... is one of twins . . . her father's\nname was Wolf.\" This lady was herself the recipient of a message.\nShe is well known to Mrs Hughes and had had private Sittings.\nThis naturally tends to invalidate the allusions to twins and to the\nWolff family, as Mrs Hughes may well have known these facts about\nthe lady sitting next to the recipient. There is also the possibility\nthat Mrs Hughes may have identified the recipient as a friend of this\nlady whom she knew.\nThe third case is certainly the best, the gentleman in question\nnever having attended a spiritualistic meeting before, and being\nquite unconnected with Mrs Hughes. He says that some of his\nrelations had been interested in the spiritualist movement, but that\nnone knew Mrs Hughes.\nThe message was as follows :\nMrs Hughes :\n\" Sir, did you know anyone called Bromwell ?\nMr and Mrs Bromwell have come to your side ... or is it Bramwell ?\nNot a relation, but knew you as a boy. They say, '\nAsk him if he\nknew a policeman '.\nHe says, '\nWill you tell him Jack is here ', and\nas Jack comes along, I can just see him as if he has taken a hat from\nhis head and placed it on your knee. He says, '\nI want you to know\nwe have a happy home here and one day you will enter therein '.\nI am touching a soul who was very doubtful, wondering if life went\non or not. Jack, Renie, Annie and Sam want you to know it is all\ntrue. Do you know Douglas ? Or, you are Douglas ? Renie says,\n'\nDon't forget I am helping my boy and helping you ' \".\n\f206 C. V. C. Herbert [part\nThe recipient's annotations are as follows :\n\" I cannot recall the name of Bromwell, but knew several Bromleys\nwho have passed over. I also had a nephew who served in the police\nforce. Rene was my late wife, Jack our dear doggie who survived\nher by six months. Sam was an old friend, and Annie, although\nalive, I believe, his wife. Regret that I cannot fix Douglas. The\nboy mentioned is my son.\"\nIn answer to further inquiries the recipient says that Annie, the\nwife of Sam, is still living, but that this Annie's mother, who was also\ncalled Annie, and was the recipient's Aunt, is dead, so it may be that\nit was she who was intended.\nThere are, of course, several discrepancies. If the Jack men-\ntioned was intended for the dog, he can hardly have been seen to\n\" (take) a hat from his head and (place) it on (the recipient's) knee.\"\nAnd he can certainly not have made the speech, \" I want you to\nknow we have a happy home here and that one day you will enter\ntherein \", of which Jack seems to have been the author. Nor is\n\" Ask him if he knew a pohceman \" a very direct way of \" getting\nover \" that the recipient's nephew had served in the police force.\nBut for all that there are some striking things in the message. Renie\nis not a common name, and although Sam and Annie are very usual,\nthey are by no means certain hits.\nBromwell or Bramwell for Bromley is not so good, and Douglas is a\nmisfire. In all we have Renie, Sam, Annie, Bromwell or Bramwell,\nJack and Douglas ; six names, of which Renie, Sam and Annie are\ncorrect, Bromwell is partly correct, Jack is significant but incorrect\nin the context, and Douglas is wrong. There is also the attribution\nof a son to Renie, which is correct. All this would certainly appear\nto be above chance expectation, and it is very difficult to see how\nunder the circumstances there can have been any normal leakage.\nOur examination of this meeting at the Caxton Hall shows that a\nlarge majority of the recipients of messages have had previous con-\ntact with Mrs Hughes\u2014generally in the form of private sittings ; and\nthat of the three cases examined, where no contact could be found,\ntwo certainly provide a prirna facie case for supernormal cogni-\ntion. It is impossible to say more ; but there can be no doubt that\nthe investigation proves the desirability of further research into Mrs\nHughes' platform work.\nOn the occasion of a private platform demonstration given by Mrs\nHughes at the London Spirituafist Alliance on December 1st, 1938,\nthe Alliance suggested to the Society that we might combine with\n\f158] Preliminary Investigation of Platfm~m Clairvoyante 207\nthem to share the cost of taking a shorthand note, it being agreed\nthat names and addresses should be taken of the recipients of mes-\nsages, and a questionnaire sent out as before, the rephes received to\nbe communicated to the Society. We were naturally very glad to\navail ourselves of this kind offer.\nAt this meeting 19 messages were given, and 14 recipients left their\nnames and addresses. But of the 14 only eight repUed to our en-\nquiries. Three of these had had previous private Sittings, leaving us\n5 cases for examination.\nOne of these is so slender that it is not necessary for me to quote it\nin detail. The name Harold was given which was significant for the\nrecipient's deceased brother, but the recipient did not think at the\ntime that the message was intended for him at all.\nOur second example is also weak. Mrs Hughes said :\n\" Is there anyone who knows a young man who was killed by aero-\nplane ?\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" Yes \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" Eric. I see a beautiful picture of where he is, I\nwish I could show it to you\u2014he has got a plane\u2014Eric (or Ulrich)\npassed out under those conditions, but he is back to tell you he is\nstill going on, and he says '\nTell her I am working hard with\nscientific researches '. Are you sitting for development at all 1\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" Not now. I have been \".\nMrs Hughes : \"I am very sorry to hear you have given it up, be-\ncause you are in touch with Eric and with many other souls, and I\nknow you could do a lot of good if you would just give way \".\nRecipient : \"I have communicated with him \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" You could have gone on further. Eric is very\nexcited because he can come to you \".\nThe name Eric is correct for a near relative of the recipient who\nwas killed in an aeroplane accident. It must be noted that Mrs\nHughes began by asking if there was anybody who knew a young\nman killed by aeroplane ; but the name Eric was added after the\nrecipient had rephed. But there are obviously loopholes for normal\nleakage here.\nThe following case is rather better :\nMrs Hughes :\n\" There is a gentleman standing at my side : does\nanyone know old Mr Jackson ?\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" Yes \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" He is rather an elderly gentleman and suffered\nvery much with chest trouble, this is what he has shown. It was\nnot altogether the chest, it was the heart, he has come along and\nsays, will I tell you that both Mr and Mrs Jackson have come along\n\f208 C. V. C. Herbert [part\nto see you, and especially did Mrs Jackson know you in your\nyounger days. Just today in your home you would utter these\nwords, ' If only those you loved and who belonged to you could come\nback to speak, you would be content and convinced.' I want you\nto be convinced that Mr and Mrs Jackson have come along to you\ntonight. Will you tell me, did you post a parcel for someone, if it\nwas not for yourself, it has gone abroad ? Do you know if old\nJackson lived abroad ?\n\"\nRecipient :\n\" No \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" He is showing me something of someone abroad,\nhe even speaks of the house he Hved in, and is saying, '\nTell her I\nhave met Mary over here and she is not to give way in Ufe '. He\nmeans you. Madam. There have been times when you have said\nthese words, '\nIs there anything left to live for ?\n'\nI have got to say\n'\nYes '. Mrs Jackson wants to reassure you, there is a lot to live for\nif you will only remember they are with you instead of being lost\nand gone from you for ever. Did you know an old lady who was\nburned, there is something wrong with her hand ? I do not know\nwhether it was in her late days, or when she was younger, but her\nhand was scalded. Is there anyone belonging to you named Lizzie\nin spirit, an Aunt ? William is with her, would you know that,\nWilham ?\n\"\nRecipient : \"I would '\".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" It is Lizzie who has brought him, and her arm was\nburned. Mr and Mrs Jackson ask me will I convey their grateful\nthanks to you, and be sure to look up to them when you are needing\nhelp \".\nThe recipient writes that she knew a Lizzie, not an Aunt, who had\na brother called \" Willie \", but that they had no connection with Mr\nand Mrs Jackson, who were the recipient's Aunt and Uncle. They\nlived in Ireland and she saw very little of them, but more in her\nyounger days, as stated in the message. As to Mary, Mrs Jackson has\na daughter of that name still living, but there may have been a de-\nceased relation of the Jacksons called Mary. The recipient did not\nknow many of the family which was large. She knew nothing about\nLizzie's scalded hand. The recipient says, \" I don't know anything\nabout the parcel abroad\u2014but I did make a similar remark about ' If\nonly those you loved, etc'\n\"\nHere the recipient, having claimed \" Old Mr Jackson \", was given\nthe additional information that she had known the Jacksons better\nin her young days, which was true ; and it was also suggested that\nMr Jackson Hved abroad. To this the recipient said, \" No \" ; but in\nfact the Jacksons lived in Ireland, so it was not far wrong. She was\nthen given, as associated with the Jacksons, a Lizzie who was said to\nbe her Aunt and who was with William. The recipient had known a\n\f158] Prelimiimry Investigation of Platfot'm Clairvoyante 209\nLizzie who had a brother called Willie, but she was not her aunt and\nhad no connection with the Jacksons, whereas Mrs Jackson was the\nrecipient's aunt. As the names Lizzie and Willie are far from un-\ncommon, it is not too much to suggest that chance might be respon-\nsible for the partial successes which Mrs Hughes scored in this\nmessage.\nThe next recipient had attended a public meeting with Mrs Hughes,\nbut had not received a message before. Apart from this there was\nno connection. Mrs Hughes said :\n\" Are you carrying something,\neither a cross or something in your bag that is gold ?\n\"\nThe recipient had in her bag a silver cross which had belonged to\nher deceased brother. She had brought it on purpose in the hope of\ngetting a message. The name Alec was given correctly for the com-\nmunicator, and also the name Helena as for the recipient herself.\nThis is striking as even if the recipient had taken the cross out of her\nbag during the meeting, and Mrs Hughes had seen it, that would not\nexplain the correctness of the names.\nThe last case is the most evidential so far as names are concerned.\nMrs Hughes mentioned Annie, Mrs Villma or Gihna, Katey Smith,\nMrs Smith, Daisy, Mr French and Mrs French. The recipient says\nthat Annie, Katey Smith, and Daisy are her deceased sisters. Mrs\nSmith is her mother. She knows no one called Villma or Gilma, but\nremembered afterwards that she had known a Dr French. (French\nwas mentioned as being a Doctor or a Dentist).\nHere again we have at least one message which provides a prima\nfacie case for supernormal cognition. It is hoped that by repeating\nour procedure at future demonstrations, something more positive\nmay be forthcoming, and we have therefore arranged with the Lon-\ndon SpirituaUst AlUance that a shorthand note shall be taken at both\nof two demonstrations which they are holding in February. The\nideal arrangement, of course, would be to have a special meeting at\nwhich the entire audience was made up of people who had had no\nprevious contact with Mrs Hughes. But owing to the great demand\nfor Mrs Hughes' services, this is by no means easy to arrange. In the\nmeantime, it does not seem that we can do better than to continue\nto collect evidence in the way that I have described.\nThe thanks of the Society are due to Miss Phillimore and the Lon-\ndon Spiritualist Alliance for their kind co-operation ; to those mem-\nbers of the Society who lent their services on the occasion of the\nmeeting at the Caxton Hall, and especially to Mrs K. M. Goldney ;\nand to Lord Charles Hope, who generously paid the costs of the\nshorthand writers.\n\f210 K. M. Goldney [part\nA CASE OF PURPORTED SPIRIT-COMMUNICATION DUE\nACTUALLY TO SUB-CONSCIOUS OR TRANCE MEMORY\nPOWERS.\nBy K. M. Goldney\nReport of a clairvoyant spirit-message ^ given by Mrs Helen Hughes\n(medium) on February 10, 1938 at a Meeting held at the London\nSpiritualist Alliance, 16 Queensberry Place, London, S.W. 7.\nPreliminary Statement\nMrs Helen Hughes lives in the provinces (County Durham), but\ncomes to London two or three times a year and gives both public\nMeetings and private Sittings under the auspices of the London\nSpiritualist Alliance. I have attended at various times about a\ndozen of such public Meetings.\nMrs Hughes has an extremely charming personality, and personal\ncontact with her will confirm, I consider, an initial judgment of\ncomplete integrity. Her clairvoyant powers at public meetings are,\nprima facie, very remarkable. Whilst giving the messages on such\noccasions, the medium appears to be in a condition of semi-trance ;\nbut in private sittings she also attains a condition of deep trance.\nHer platform work would appear to be particularly suited to psychical\nresearch, inasmuch as she gives specific names (both Christian and\nsurnames), dates, place names, etc. ; and it was I who urged upon\nthe Research Officer the desirability of endeavouring to bring about\nthe joint investigation of which the initial stages are here reported.\nThe disadvantage of public Meetings, which all attending them\nmust feel, is the unlikelihood in the packed hall of obtaining a message\noneself, and the impossibility of evaluating the messages given by\nthe medium to others. Since I had never myself received a message\nin these circumstances, and with the object of finding a case which\nwould bear the strictest scrutiny, I started some four years ago to\nquestion a few persons who had received striking messages, and was\ndisappointed to find that each person so questioned happened to have\nhad, at some time or other, a private sitting with the medium or had\na relative or friend who had had private sittings. In no instance, and\non no occasion, was I lucky enough to find a person who had had no\n1 The terms \" spirit-message \", \" trance \", \" communicator \", etc., etc. are\nused for convenience in a general and recognised sense, and their use does not\nnecessarily entail any specific belief regarding them.\n\f158] A Case of Purported Spirit-Communication 211\ncontact whatsoever, themselves or through relatives or friends, with\nthe medium.\nIt is natural enough that the audience on these occasions should be\nchiefly made up of those already interested in SpirituaUsm and their\nfriends, and natural also that members of the audience should have\nmade a point of havmg a private sitting with a remarkable medium.\nFurther, the fact that they had had a private sitting in no way\nPROVES that a subsequent spirit-message at a public Meeting can\nbe explained away. Nevertheless the lack of any training in research\nmethods makes the average person a hopelessly bad \" sitter \", and it\nwould be extremely difficult to establish a claim to para-normality\nwhere the receiver of a message at a public Meeting had previously\nhad a private Sitting with the medium at which verbatim notes had\nnot been made. The reader may usefully remember Sir Oliver\nLodge's dictum (Survival of Man, 10th edition, p. 189) that \" hyper-\nscepticism is more conducive to the development of the subject than\nhyper-credulity \".\nAfter attending a certain number of public Meetings, I decided to\nhave a private sitting myself with Mrs Helen Hughes. During this\nSitting\u2014the only one I have had with her\u2014I carried out an experi-\nment which proved to have interesting results.\nPrivate {Trance) Sitting with Mrs Helen Hughes [boohed anonymously)\nMay 15, 1936 at the London Spiritualist Alliance.\nAt this trance Sitting I myself took down shorthand notes of what\nwas said : not verbatim notes, but notes of all the names given and\nany important rejoinders made by myself, etc. My notes were typed\nout and filed after the Sitting.\nThe Sitting was entirely negative ;\nalthough I have had some\nstrikingly good sittings, I am by no means a consistently good sitter\nand this was possibly the worst sitting I had ever had. My notes\nshow that 28 (or more) names were given, only three of which cor-\nresponded by chance with names of deceased persons who had been\nknown to me (a remarkably small number even for chance !) and the\nrelationship of these three was not correctly given.^ Towards the\nend of this hopeless Sitting I decided to make an experiment (see\nforward).\n' I was forcibly reminded of Myer's description of Mrs Piper's Control,\nPhinuit {Proc. S. P. R. Vol. VI, p. 440) :\n\" There were some interviews through-\nout which Phinuit hardly asked any questions and hardly stated anything\nwhich was not true. There were others throughout which his utterance\nshowed not one glimmer of real knowledge, but consisted wholly of . . . random\nassertions \".\n\f212 K. M. Goldney [part\nMeeting for Clairvoyance given by Mrs Helen Hughes at the London\nSfiritualist Alliance on February 10, 1938.\nAt the time of my private Sitting (May 15, 1936), I do not think\nMrs Hughes can have known me by sight. Following this private\nSitting and the experiment made during it, I made a point of speak-\ning to Mrs Hughes without an introduction on the few available\noccasions of her visits to London, but by February 1938 I think it\nprobable she knew my name : in any case she knew me well enough\nto recognise and greet me in passing.\nOn February 10, 1938 I attended a packed Meeting at the London\nSpiritualist AlHance, at which Mrs Hughes was giving clairvoyance.\nI sat far back in the large room beside my friend Mrs R. During the\nMeeting Mrs Hughes pointed to Mrs R., and the following conversa-\ntion took place (approximate rendering).\nMrs Hughes :\n\" Now I want THAT lady \" (pointing). Mrs R.\nheld up her hand. \" Yes, that's right, I want you. There is some-\none here who has come for you : BESSIE\u2014wait\u2014(apparently\nhstening to a spirit communicator)\u2014BESSIE WHITE. Do you\nknow BESSIE WHITE ?\n\"\nMrs R. :\n\" No I don't ; I can't think of anyone of that name \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" That's funny. BESSIE WHITE\u2014are you sure\nyou don't know her ? No ; wait ; it is not for you but for the lady\nsitting next to you \". \/ then held up jh?\/ hand. \" Yes, that's right.\nBessie White is here for you. Do you recognise her 1\n\"\nK. M. Goldney : (After a shght pause) \" Yes ; I understand that\nname \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" BESSIE WHITE\u2014and ALEC\u2014ALEC WHITE.\nDo you know him too ?\n\"\nK. M. Goldney :\n\" Yes ; I understand that also \".\nAs Mrs Hughes gave the name BESSIE WHITE to me, my mind\nflashed back to my ^^rivate Sitting with her of a year and nine months\npreviously. What I dimly remember justified me, I felt, in claiming\n\" I understood \" the names given. Nevertheless I had no knowledge\nof any Bessie White or Alec White in actual fact, nor any clear\nmemory of having heard the names before.\nOn returning home I immediately looked up the file containing the\nnotes of my private Sitting of May 15, 1936 and read the following\ncommentary, which I had attached to these notes :\nSitting with Mrs Helen Hughes {boohed anonymously) May 15, 1936.\n\" I had been told (Mrs Hughes) was not so good at private Sittings\n(as at public Meetings), but determined to have one with her. The\nattached summary was made from shorthand notes taken at the\n\f158] A Case of Purported Spirit-Communication 213\ntime ... by myself. When I saw what rubbish was coming through,\nI determined towards the end of the Sitting to give false recognition\nto a set of names, in order to see whether these would later be given\nback to me at a pubhc Meeting. I intended to go to such and\npossibly speak to Mrs Hughes {i.e. draw attention to my presence\nat the Meeting) with this in view. At a given point in the Sitting\n\u2014\nTHE WHITE FAMILY\u2014I begin to reply as if the communicators\nwere real and the names veridical \".\n(That is to say, I claimed recognition of the names and relationship\ngiven to me by the medium, although in fact the names were un-\nknown to me.)\nTurning then to the given point in my summarised, shorthand notes\nat which I claimed this recognition, I found this :\nMrs Hughes :\n\" BESSIE WHITE is here. Was she a relative ?\n\"\nK. M. GoLDNEY :\n\" Yes \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" Has Mrs White got her son with her ?\n\"\nK. M. GoLDNEY :\n\" Yes \".\nMrs Hughes :\n\" All the White family are here\u2014ALEC WHITE \".\nK. M. Goldney :\n\" I didn't know him myself\u2014I knew of him \".\n(Note : The conversation is given in my notes in summarised form :\nit must be understood that at the time I indulged in a certain\namount of dramatisation, suitable to the experiment.)\nA description was given by the medium of Mrs White's sudden\ndeath by burning. Mrs White then purported to control the medium\nand communicate directly herself, saying she was doing so for the\nfirst time. She spoke with a strong Scotch accent (I had previously\nagreed with the medium that I had Scotch relations). Her talk was\nthat of a farmer's wife and she spoke of farming conditions, remind-\ning me of a lambing season we had spent together in Scotland (I had\nnever been in Scotland at that time, know nothing of farming or\ncountry conditions, and have no Scotch relations except on a grand-\nmother's side some four generations or so back).^\nCommentary\nWhen making my experiment on May 15, 1936, I wondered\nwhether the false information I was giving and the remarks I was\n^ The reader is again referred to the similarity here to the trance Control of\nMrs Piper (Rector) ; and his acceptance of misleading suggestions by the\nsitter. \" Rector \", says Sir Oliver Lodge, (Survival of Man, p. 216) \"... is\nevidently in the position of receiving ideas by a sort of dictation, and need not\nalways be able clearly to discriminate their som-ce, whether from the ultra-\nmaterial or from the material side \". Experimental observations of this sort\nmay prove to be of the utmost importance in leading us eventually to an under-\nstanding of the trance state.\n\f214 K. M. Goldney [part\nmaking to Mrs Hughes whilst she was in a trance would be given\nback to me at some pubhc Meeting in the near future in the form of a\nspirit-message. I attended each subsequent Meeting she gave in\nLondon and drew attention to my presence by greeting her where\npossible, but no message came. By February 1938 I had forgotten\nall the details of my private sitting\u2014^had almost forgotten, indeed,\nthe whole experiment\u2014and only the echo of a memory was stirred\nwhen the names BESSIE WHITE and ALEC WHITE were given\nto me. The lapse of time had wiped away all conscious memory of\nthe meaningless details and names given at my private Sitting, and\nonly reference to my files showed that names I had claimed as veri-\ndical out of a large number of unrecognised names twenty-one\nmonths previously coincided with those given me again so long after.\nMrs Hughes is a very busy and successful medium, booked up (she\nhas told me) for months, even years, ahead. On referring to an\nofficial at the London SpirituaUst Alhance, I was told that she gave\nusually 16 private Sittings a week whilst in London, (their rule being\nthat no medium should give more than three Sittings a day) ; and\nthat if one reckoned an average of 15 Sittings a week for 10 months\nof the year, it would probably be a fairly accurate surmise (the other\ntwo months being free from Sittings on account of holidays, days\nspent in travelling, occasional sickness, etc., etc. This would of\ncourse exclude any unusual year of sickness, which would curtail the\nnumber of Sittings given in a year.)\nAt the rate of 15 Sittings a week for 10 months of the year, we can\nsuppose that Mrs Hughes gave, very roughly, some 1,000 or 1,100\nSittings between the dates of May 1936 and February 1938 (this\nallows four or five months free of Sittings and sixteen or seventeen\nmonths' work out of the twenty-one months).\nAt my Sitting she produced 28 names. If this can be considered\nnormal, 1,100 Sittings would produce some 30,000 names.^ A large\npart of Mrs Hughes' Ufe is spent going from one town to another\ngiving public Meetings and private Sittings to a succession of anony-\nmous or seldom-seen Sitters. Yet in the semi-trance condition per-\ntaining during her clairvoyance, one almost a stranger to her could\nbe correctly given names for which significance had been falsely\nclaimed 21 months before at a single Sitting. This, I consider, goes\nfar beyond any feat of normal memory, and constitutes an example\nof the striking possibilities of trance memory, presumably akin to\nthe feats of memory (if such it can be called) pertaining to the hyp-\nnotic state.\n1 Weeks containing public meetings would probably somewhat increase the\nweekly quota of sitters but decrease the weekly reckoning of names.\n\f158] A Case of Purported Spirit-Communication 215\nIn making this experiment I had in mind similar experiments made\nby Sir OUver Lodge and Richard Hodgson with Mrs Piper, \" in\norder to see what effect on the medium's trance mind was produced\nby a carelessness or untrustworthiness of Sitters themselves \". For\nexample, Professor E. C. K. Gonner, Lecturer on Economics at\nUniversity College, Liverpool, and a colleague of Sir Oliver (then\nProfessor) Lodge, was purposely introduced to Mrs Piper as Mr\nMcCunn, another colleague, in order to test the effect on the medium's\ntrance mind. The significant result justifies the means, and I have\nhttle doubt that Mrs Hughes herself and students of psychical re-\nsearch will have the good sense to recognise the legitimacy of such\nan experiment, provided one is careful to appraise it at its due value\nand no more.\nConclusion\nIt should be unnecessary to point out that the demonstrated fact\nthat Mrs Hughes can store in her sub-conscious mind the minutest\ndetails concerning a Sitter and reproduce these months, possibly\nyears, later, does NOT invalidate the hypothesis and claim that she\nobtains clairaudient messages from the dead. Such a conclusion\nwould be quite unjustified. Here again we can apply to Mrs Hughes's\ntrance the attributes ascribed by Sir Oliver Lodge to Mrs Piper's\nControl (Phinuit) when he writes :\n\" The attitude is ... as of one\nstraining every clue and making use of the slightest indication,\nwhether received in normal or abnormal ways ;\nnot, indeed, dis-\ntinguishing between information received from the Sitter and in-\nformation from other sources \". {Proc. S. P. R. Vol. XI, p. 449).\nThe conclusions we are justified in making can be summarised as\nfollows :\n(1) The experiment undertaken would appear to demonstrate\nthe possession by this medium (and presumably by others) of sub-\nliminal powers of memory in the trance or semi-trance state quite\nbeyond the possibilities of conscious memory. As a result it renders\nnull and void the contention often put forward by those unaware of\nsuch subhminal powers that it is \" absurd \" to suppose that a medium\ncan remember facts concerning the hundreds of Sitters she sees in a\nyear.\n(2) Admitting that these possibly limitless powers of memory are\nin force during trance or partial-trance conditions, it becomes\nobvious that if we are to test the spiritualist hypothesis, only\ndefinite research work under test conditions is of value, and Meetings\nshould be arranged of selected Sitters NONE of whom have had any\n\f216 K. M. Goldney [part\ncontact whatever, direct or indirect (through friends or relations),\nwith the medium, and all of whom are willing to annotate, and\nanswer questions regarding, the material given them with the object\nof obtaining positive results.\nAs I have already stated, I consider Mrs Hughes's powers remark-\nable, and with patience and perseverance\u2014modifying one's pro-\ncedure in the hght of experience gained by experiment and practice\n\u2014\nI have every hope that we shall obtain conclusive results.\n\f158] Review 217\nREVIEW\nAdventures in Psychical Research by C. E. M. Joad. Harper's Maga-\nzine, June 1938.\nDr Joad is the Chairman of the London University Council for\nPsychical Investigation, the Head of the Department of Philosophy\nand Psychology at Birkbeck College, and a well-known writer on\nphilosophical subjects.\nIt is therefore natural that an account of his personal experiences\nas an investigator of psychic phenomena should attract considerable\nattention and deserve serious consideration. Dr Joad begins his\narticle as follows :\n\" Let me begin by stating my credentials. I have\nhad at different times a certain amount of firsthand experience of\nwhat I will non-committally call abnormal phenomena. This ex-\nperience has been due largely to the facilities afforded in London by\nthe National Laboratory of Psychical Research ...\" \" By the\ncourtesy of the Director of the Laboratory, Mr Harry Price, ... I\nhave had the advantage of sitting with a number of well-known\nmediums and have witnessed at different times a considerable num-\nber of varied phenomena.\"\n\" Before I proceed to a description of some of the phenomena I\nhave witnessed I had better state my behefs in order that the reader\nmay be in a position to discount my bias.\"\nFrom the above sentences it would appear that all the occurrences\nmentioned by Dr Joad in this article are described as having oc-\ncurred imder his personal observation, and this impression is con-\nfirmed by the frequent use throughout the article of the first personal\nsingular and plural. The occurrences described all relate to what are\nknown as \" physical \" phenomena, a branch of psychical research in\nwhich it is notorious that the debate as to what in fact happened has\nalways been particularly acute, and accordingly first-hand accounts\nof competent observers are of the greatest value. Sittings with four\nmediums are described. With one of them, Eva C, Dr Joad had a\nsitting or sittings at the Institut Metapsychique in Paris. The other\nthree mediums named in the article are Mrs Duncan, Rudi Schneider\nand Eleanore Ziigun. Very full records of the investigation of these\nthree mediums at the National Laboratory have been pubhshed by\n\f218 Review [PABT\nMr Harry Price, either in the Proceedings and Bulletins of the\nNational Laboratory or in book form.^\nOn comparing Dr Joad's accounts of these mediums with the very\nfull accounts given by Mr Harry Price, the student cannot fail to be\nstruck with several discrepancies of the kind which have in the past\nmade the study of physical phenomena so problematical. To take\nfirst the case of the Duncan mediumship ; after mentioning that\nMrs Duncan was investigated for some time at the National Labora-\ntory of Psychical Research, Dr Joad proceeds to describe various\nincidents in a very positive manner and in terms which, taken in\nconjunction with the sentences quoted at the beginning of this re-\nview, appear to indicate that Dr Joad was a witness of what he\ndescribes. He writes, for example, \" One could put out one's hand\nand touch the stuff [i.e. ectoplasm], which felt hke the white of a\nhard-boiled egg and was faintly luminous. The whole performance\nwas extraordinarily impressive, and for a time a number of us were\ninclined to '\nbeheve '\nIt was an X-ray photograph which put\nus on the track of this deception. One day we photographed Mrs\nDuncan ... On no other occasion have I seen ectoplasm.\"\nBut the 1931 Bulletin, \" Regurgitation and the Duncan Medium-\nship \", in the account of each of the five sittings held with Mrs\nDuncan at the National Laboratory, gives a list of all the persons\nsaid to have been present at each sitting, and on no occasion does Dr\nJoad's name appear in these hsts. Later in the same Bulletin (App.\nC, p. 105), there is printed a \" List of Sitters who examined the\nDuncan Manifestations \". This gives the names of 27 persons pre-\nsent at one or more of the sittings and again Dr Joad's name does not\nappear. In addition to the persons named, the hst mentions, with-\nout naming them, the presence of an analyst, an obstetrician, and a\nphysician, but there is nothing to suggest that Dr Joad, who we be-\nlieve does not hold any of the requisite qualifications, was one of\nthese three specialists, nor is his name to be found in the index.\nEither therefore both the lists of observers at separate sittings and\nalso App. C. of this Bulletin are incomplete, or Dr Joad was not pre-\nsent at the Duncan sittings which he describes. If the latter be the\ntrue explanation, the language he uses in describing them is certainly\n1 \" A Report on the Telekinetic and other Phenomena witnessed through\nEleanore Ziigun.\" Proceedings of the N.L.P.R., Vol. I (Part 1), January 1927.\n\" Regurgitation and the Duncan Mediumship.\" Bulletin of the N.L.P.R.,\n1931.\n\" Rudi Schneider \", by Harry Price. (Methuen, 1930.)\n\" An Account of some Further Experiments with Rudi Schneider.\"\nBulletin IV of the N.L.P.R., 1933.\n\f158] Review 219\nunfortunate. For example, the sentence \" On no other occasion\nhave I seen ectoplasm \", with which he concludes his account of the\nDuncan sittings, can hardly be interpreted otherwise than as an\nassertion that at one of the Duncan sittings at the National Labora-\ntory he did see ectoplasm.\nThere are also minor discrepancies between Dr Joad's and Mi\nHarry Price's accounts of the Duncan mediumship. When Dr Joad\nspeaks of Mrs Duncan \" by some means getting her hands free from\nthe silken sack in which she was encased \", he has failed to under-\nstand the nature of the one-piece garment, having sleeves and\n\" gloving \" the hands, which the medium wore at the sittings ; as\nthere would be no need for her to free them from this garment in\norder to use her hands to manipulate ectoplasm as suggested. Then\nagain, Dr Joad writes \" One day we photographed Mrs Duncan.\nThis of course was done with her consent but\u2014a fact to which she\ndid not consent because she did not know of it\u2014one of the photo-\ngraphs was an X-ray photograph, and this showed a small safety-\npin, cosily nestling in the middle of Mrs Duncan's inside \". This\napparently refers to what occurred at the ith seance on the 28th\nMay 1931, the only occasion when an X-ray photograph was either\nattempted or carried out. The incident is described at some length\non pp. 61-63 of the Bulletin. After stating (p. 61) that the medium's\nhusband consented to his wife being X-rayed, but that she was un-\neasy at the preparations being made for the X-ray, the Bidletin con-\ntinues (p. 62) \" and then the unexpected happened, Mrs Duncan\ndemanded that she should be X-rayed ! Although we knew it would\nnow be useless, we consented, as the equipment had taken half a day\nto instal and there was just a very remote possibility that something\nmight be revealed.\n\" So the medium was X-rayed after all, Dr Wilham Brown being\npresent. We made three radiographs, one of the abdomen, one of the\nchest or thorax, and one of the skull (reproduced Plate XXV). They\nwere developed immediately after and no abnormaUties can be de-\ntected. In any case, the depth of the medimn would preclude any\nanatomical pecuharities from reveahng themselves. As a matter of\nfact, the radiographs of the abdomen and thorax are merely blurs.\"\nNothing is said about any safety-pin.\nAs regards the phenomena of Rudi Schneider the problems raised\nby Dr Joad's article are rather different. Dr Joad writes, \" the most\nremarkable of these phenomena [meaning apparently telekinesis]\nwhich I have seen was connected with the Austrian medium Rudi\nSchneider. ... In seances lasting over two separate years Rudi pro-\nduced, under strictly controlled conditions, remarkable phenomena.\n\f220 Review [PAET\nOf these perhaps the most outstanding seen by me was the raising of\na handkerchief without visible agency into the air where it tied itself\ninto a knot.\"\nDr Joad does not specifically state where the Rudi Schneider seances,\nto which he refers, took place, but in view of the sentences quoted at\nthe beginning of this review it is a natural inference that, imless there\nis a definite statement to the contrary, he is throughout his article\nspeaking of seances at the National Laboratory, and that the phrase\n\" seances lasting over two separate years \" is meant to indicate the\ntwo series of seances held at the National Laboratory from April 1929\nto January 1930, described in Mr Price's book \" Rudi Schneider \",\nand from February to May 1932, described in Bulletin IV of the\nNational Laboratory. From Mr Price's book and this Bulletin it\nwould appear that Dr Joad was present at one sitting in each of these\ntwo series, namely that of November 25th 1929 and that of February\n23rd 1932, the latter being described in the Bulletin as a negative\nsitting. Of the sitting on November 25th 1929, on the other hand,\nthe report in Mr Price's book (pp. 75-88) says, \" the latter portion of\nit was brilhant \". In addition to the report given in the book, which\nconsists of a transcription of what was dictated into a dictaphone\nduring the sitting, there is reproduced ra the book an account con-\ntributed by Dr Joad himself to the Press the day after the sitting.\nNeither the official record of the sitting, nor Dr Joad's contribution\nto the Evening Standard, (26th Nov. 1939) contains any reference to\nthis very strikmg incident of the handkerchief, although several\nother phenomena are mentioned as having occurred at the sitting\nin question.\nDr Joad continues \" Nothuig could be seen to touch the handker-\nchief ;\nbut, on the view suggested above, that which made contact\nwith it must, presumably, have been something material. Accord-\ningly X-ray photographs were taken with a view to detecting what,\nif anything, was in contact with the handkerchief \". After a descrip-\ntion of the photographic procedure he continues, \" As the result of a\nnumber of experiments photographs were obtained showing some\ndark substance making contact with the objects, a substance which,\ninvisible to the human eye, was apparently visible to the X-ray \".\nBut the reports of the Rudi sittings at the National Laboratory\nmake no mention whatsoever of X-ray photographs being taken at\neither of the two sittings when Dr Joad was present, or at any other\nsitting.\nIf Dr Joad is referring to sittings elsewhere than at the National\nLaboratory, it is a pity that he does not specify the place, or time, or\nrefer the reader to any contemporary account of the incident.\n\f158] Review 221\nNor are Dr Joad's references to Eleanore Ziigun free from difficulty.\nHe writes as follows :\n\" A curious incident happened to myself. On\nthe last day of Eleanore's visit to the Laboratory I, together with a\nnumber of those who had \" sat with \" her during the preceding\nfortnight, went to say good-by. There was, I think, some sort of\ntea party and a fair-sized crowd of people had assembled. Owing to\nthe press of people, I did not actually speak to Eleanore, but waved\nmy hand to her across the room and left after a short visit. I was\ngoing to the country, and in the train took a book out of my bag to\nread ; it was a new book and some of the pages were uncut. I felt in\nmy pocket for my penknife ; the feel of it was certainly unusual and,\npulling it out, I found that a crescent-shaped piece of metal\u2014in\npoint of fact the metal letter C\u2014encircled the knife in such a way\nthat so long as the letter was there it could not be opened. So tightly\nwas the knife wedged into the encirchng piece of metal that a mallet\nand chisel were required to remove it \".\nNow, it is a curious fact that whereas Dr Joad is not mentioned at\nall in the Proceedings of the National Laboratory for January 1927,\nwhich are entirely devoted to the investigation of Eleanore Ziigun,\nan experience remarkably similar to that described by Dr Joad\noccurred to the late Professor E. J. Tillyard, and is by him related at\nlength on pp. 57-58 of these Proceedings. He also went to say good-by\nto her and actually shook her hand, and then hke Dr Joad took\ntrain for the country. His train left Victoria at 8.20 for Rochester\nand to quote his words, \" I had an evening paper, which occupied me\nabout as far as Bromley. Then I took out Huxley's book from my\ngreatcoat pocket and began to read it. By the time we reached\nSwanley, I had read eight pages and was then interested enough to\nbe considerably annoyed when I found that the next few pages had\nnot been cut. So I opened my greatcoat, put my hand down into the\nleft pocket of my coat, and felt for my knife to cut the pages with.\nThen a curious feeling came over me. The km'fe did not feel like my\nknife at all. I drew it out and found firmly attached to the metal\nhalf-ring of the leather case enclosing it a white metalhc C which\neffectively closed the case (see Fig. 4). I reahsed at once that it was\nthe C which had been lost 1 1 days before from the notice-board of the\nground floor of 16 Queensberry Place and the loss of which had been\ngenerally attributed to '\nDracu ', [a control of Eleanore Ziigun.]\n\"\nIt is certainly strange that Dr Joad and Professor Tillyard should\nboth have experiences so strikingly similar on the same occasion.\nDifficulties and discrepancies such as these are the despair of the\npsychical researcher. The general pubhc is very badly informed on\nmatters of psychical research, especially perhaps on matters con-\n\f222 Review [part 158]\nnected with physical phenomena. It is therefore of the greatest\nimportance that all published accoimts of such phenomena should\nbe strictly accurate in detail : otherwise the whole subject is hkely\nto be discredited in the eyes of intelligent enquirers. Dr Joad owes\nit to his position, both in the academic world and in psychical re-\nsearch to clear up the difficulties we have pointed out.\nW. H.

Ill, further data from\nMrs Garrett have been added. Treatment of the whole material by\nthe same general method as before, but avoiding certain pitfalls, shows\nthat there is a significant relationship between the J and E reactions\nobtained from the different mediums. This is chiefly shown by a\nnegative correlation between the values (J-E) obtained from Sharplin\nand Garrett, increasing from occasion to occasion. Further investi-\ngation shows that the magnitude of this correlation is not inde-\npendent of the mediums' own reaction times; this supports the\nhypothesis of Interference, rather than of Interchange, as an expla-\nnation of the negative effect found. Collateral evidence is also dis-\ncussed, and indicates that the true anti-chance odds ^ are considerably\ngreater than the 49 to 1 actually evaluated.\nThe operation of some kind of external factor or influence is\nstrongly suggested. This does not \" prove \" the autonomy of the\n\" communicators \" concerned, but constitutes supporting evidence\nin its favour as compared with the implications of a null result.\n^ This term is used as a colloquial convenience : To say that the anti-\nchance odds are m to 1 is equivalent to the expanded form \" A deviation from\nthe expected result of the magnitude observed would occur, as the outcome\nof chance alone, on the average only once in n + 1 such experiments.\"\nM 223\n\f224 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc.

III,^ I\nrashly opined that, before reaching the conclusions there given, I had\n\" tried all the wrong ways first \". This was optimistic, for Dr\nThouless had little difficulty in showing ^ that exhaustion of wrong\nways had been far from completed ; and no one can agree with\nhim more cordially than I in regretting that the aberrations to\nwhich he drew attention should have been immortalised in print.\nAs a matter of fact, so far at least as the work here considered is\nconcerned, there was nothing wrong with the basic method employed,\nor with the data (except that there were not enough of them), or\nwith the accuracy of the computations as such, so far as I am aware.\nThere was a quite inexcusable error of logic involved in treating\nthe data obtained from Mrs Leonard in two different years as if\nthey had been obtained from two different mediums ;\nand I was\naltogether at sea in my attempts to deal with the regressions\n(\" slopes \") observed and to combine the probabilities derived from\nthese and other quantities into an overall test of significance. It\nis important to note that these sources of error have been rectified in\nwhat follows, not only because I am \" wiser to-day than I was\nyesterday \", but because I have enjoyed the benefit of adequate\ninstruction and supervision from appropriate authority in the tech-\nnical points involved.\nAs so often before, I must express my gratitude to Professor\nFisher and the staff of the Galton Laboratory for many kindnesses ;\nin particular, I am very greatly indebted to Mr W. L. Stevens for\nputting me right, or preventing me going astray, on innumerable\noccasions, and especially for looking through the relevant passages\nof the manuscript as a final check up on the validity of the statistical\nmethods employed. He is not, of course, in any way responsible\nfor the interpretation that I or any one else may tend to place on\nthe results obtained.\nI am also under no small obligation, which it is a pleasure to\nrecord, to Mr Oliver Gatty, Professor Broad and Dr Thouless for\nmuch valued advice, encouragement and help.\nMaterial.\u2014The material dealt with here consists of the reaction\ntimes obtained at four sittings each with Mrs Leonard (October\n1 Proc. S.P.R., Part 149, Vol. XLIV, December 1936.\n2 Ibid. Part 150, Vol. XLIV, October 1937.\n\f159] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 225\nand November 1935), Mrs Sliarpliii (October 1935) and Mrs Garrett\n(Sej)tember 1936). As stated in my earlier paper, there were\nactually five sittings with the first two mediums ; but as external\ncircumstances prevented Mr Drayton Thomas (to whom I am again\nindebted for the collection of observations) from obtaining more than\nfour sittings with Mrs Garrett, I have thought it best to ignore the\nfifth Leonard and Sharplin sittings altogether, in the interests of\nsimpUcity and of using a compact block of data. This gives us a\ntotal of 2,400 observations from J and E through the three mediums.\nA total of 800 reactions from Feda were also obtained at the four\nsittings with Leonard and Sharplin ; these led to no results of\ninterest, but the figures are given in Table I B for the sake of\ncompleteness.\nAs explained elsewhere, the order of the words within each group\nof 25, was varied from occasion (sitting) to occasion ; this variation\nwas systematic for Leonard and Sharplin, but randomised by means\nof shuffled cards in the case of Garrett. Hereinafter the words 1-25\nwill be referred to as group A, 26-50 as group B, etc., while the\noccasions will be denoted by the Roman numerals I-IV.\nPreparation of Data.\u2014a. Misheard, etc., words.\u2014In a few cases\nthe stimulus word had quite evidently been misheard by the subject.\nFor example, when the response \" calm \" is given to the stinmlus\n\" peach \", or the response \" absolve \" to the stimulus \" drive \",\nthere can be little doubt that these stimuli have been misheard as\n\" peace \" and \" shrive \" respectively. In such cases reference Vv^as\nmade to the other occasions on which the same personaHty had\nresponded to the same stimulus word. The times there recorded\nwere expressed as percentages of the median values of the times of\ntheir groups, and the mean of these percentages multiplied l)y the\nmedian value of the times of the group affected gave the value of\nthe time to be used in place of that recorded against the word\nmisheard. Thus, if on occasions I, II and III the word in question\nhad a time of 61 per cent., 75 per cent., and 65 per cent, the group\nmedian (mean value 67 per cent.), and on occasion IV, when it was\nmisheard, the group had a median value 12, it would be given a\ntime of 8, this being 67 per cent., to the nearest integer, of 12.\nThe same procedure, but using occasion instead of group medians,\nwas adopted when working by occasions instead of by groups.\nSuch interpolation was only used when there could be no reason-\nable doubt of the mishearing ; doubtful cases were allowed to stand.\nTwo or three errors in typing were dealt with in the same way.\nh. Over-long times.\u2014As I have explained in an earlier paper, it\nsometimes happens that the subject's response is so long delayed\n\f226 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nthat tlie time elapsing before reply cannot fairly be regarded as\nrepresenting a normal reaction. Where this has occurred, and an\nabnormally long time has actually been recorded (or no time, but\nthe note \" Long \" given by the experimenter) I have substituted,\nas an upper limit, a time equal to 2-25 times the median of the group\n(or of the occasion, if working by occasions) concerned. This is, of\ncourse, arbitrary ; but previous experience has shown that it is\nappropriate to data of this type, and certainly no exception can be\ntaken to it. It is clearly preferable to allowing fantastically long\ntimes to stand or to using some still more arbitrary limit, such as\n50 units (fifths of a second) in all cases, which would disregard the\nprevailing tendency to give relatively long or short times. It\nappears to err, if anything, slightly on the side of generosity, but a\nprolonged research would be necessary to determine the precisely\noptimal value, and there would be little to be gained thereby.\nAs a result of practical experience, however, Mr Drayton Thomas\nformed the opinion (which appears to be well justified) that these\nlong delays were not, in general, chiefly due to the effect of the\nstimulus word, but to other causes such as local distractions or,\nmore particularly, to the communicator or control momentarily\n\" losing grip \" of the medium. He accordingly adopted the practice\nof leaving such stimuli on one side for a minute or two and then\ngiving them again after a short interval. This second attempt\nalmost invariably elicited a reaction time of normal length.\nI have carefully examined all such instances and find that in no\ncase does any word show such delay as to require a repetition on\nmore than one occasion for the same personality. It seems clear\ntherefore that these delays are not characteristic of the word and\npersonahty concerned, so that, in order to give the fairest possible\npicture of the personality's reactions, it is better to use the RT\nobtained at the second time of asking rather than to treat the\nreaction as \" over-long \" and write 2-25 times the median for it.\nTo this rule I have made only one exception, namely a word\nwhich had to be twice repeated before a reply could be obtained and,\nmoreover, gave a time of 233 per cent, its group median on an earlier\noccasion. In view of these facts I have had little hesitation in\naccepting this reaction as a genuine instance of an \" over-long\n\"\ntime and substituting 2-25 times the relevant median.\nc. Corrections.\u2014In Q.S.T.P. Ill, pp. 216-7, I expressed some\nuneasiness lest the apparently significant results there obtained\nmight possibly be due to the effects of practice or fatigue. The\nfact that the results in question were unreliable, in the sense of being\nobtained by unsatisfactory methods, does not lessen the necessity\n\f159] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 227\nof clearing up this point before proceeding to a re-examination of\nthe material.\nActually, the likelihood of artifacts being generated in this way\nis small. In the cases of Leonard and Sharphn, the order of the\nwords within each group of twenty-five was varied systematically,\nand in the case of Garrett was completely randomised by the use of\nshufEied cards, so that it is very difhcult to see how any such effect\ncould be produced. None the less, I thought it wise to examine\nthe point in detail. I accordingly worked the value of the linear\nregression coefficient '\n6 ', of the variance absorbed by the regres-\nsion, of the residual variance, and of the '\nt\n'\nused for testing the\nsignificance of '\n& ', for each of the ninety-six sheets concerned.\nFrom the distribution of the fs so obtained we can determine the\nlikelihood of the regressions observed being the result of chance\nalone. ^\nThe ninety-sis sheets thus treated yielded one result beyond the\n\u202201 level of significance, with P about -005 ; there was another with\nP almost exactly -01 , another at about the -02 point, and four at or\nvery near the -05 level. There is nothing surprising in such figures\nwhen so many as 96 sheets are involved, for we should naturally\nexpect one result at the -01 level, and others in proportion, as the re-\nsult of chance alone, so that the divergence from expectation is small.\nAs it happens, the most significant results occurred in the Garrett\nmaterial, and as this was randomised we may fairly say that they\n'\nmust ' have been due to chance. The distribution of the fs shows\nthat effects of the observed magnitudes and signs would arise from\nchance alone in more than 85 per cent., 75 per cent, and 50 per cent,\nof such experiments in the cases of Leonard, Garrett and Sharplin\nrespectively. Finally, it is interesting to note that only one set of\nfour sheets constituting the testing of a given personaUty on a\ngiven occasion, out of twenty-four such sets, shows a regression\ncoefiicient of the same sign {i.e. a uniform practice or fatigue effect)\nthroughout : we should expect three from chance alone, so that\nfrom this point of view the incidence of practice and fatigue effects\nseems sUghtly subnormal.\n1 This is standard practice which I need not elaborate here. The \" linear\nregression coefiicient h \" is the measure of the practice or fatigue effect observed,\naccording to sign ; the \" variance absorbed \" is the amount by which the\noriginal variance of the reaction times of the sheet is reduced when the effect\nis corrected : the \" residual variance \" is what is left when the absorbed\nvariance is subtracted from the total original variance : and the value of t is\ngiven by \\ {Absorbed Variance)js- where s- is the residual variance divided\nby the number of residual degrees of freedom\u2014here 23.

[part\nThere is, in short, no evidence at all for supposing that either\npractice or fatigue are operative within the groups. And since the\nresult of applving corrections would be to decrease just that varia-\nbility of the times in which we are interested, it is clear that to use\nthem in these circumstances would be not only supererogatory but\npernicious.\nI have accordingly used uncorrected data when working by\nGroups, although, as will be explained in due course, I have applied\nsuitable corrections for inter-group differences when working by\noccasions.\nd. Logarithmic transformation.\u2014It will he understood that since\nthe reaction time cannot be less than zero, and in practice not less\nthan ,5 or 4 imits, whereas it may be indefinitely prolonged, the\nfrequency distribution of the times will not be symmetrical ; that\nis to say, the times will not be normally distributed. Actually, the\ndeviation from normality is not serious, but in order to reduce\npossible ill effects from this cause to a minimum, I have adopted\na suggestion for which I am indebted to Mr Yates of the Rothamsted\nExperimental Station and have replaced each time by its common\nlogarithm. This virtually removes all skewness from the distri-\nbution and is a precaution which should be adopted in all work of\nthis kind. In order to avoid inconveniently heavy figures I have\nin practice used the value 100 (logRT-1), as will be seen from\nExample I below.\nFurther Illustration of Differential Method.\u2014The neces-\nsity for using the differences between the two sets of measurements\nfor two personalities was emphasised in my Q.S.T.P. Ill, and was\nfurther elaborated by Dr Thouless {lac. cit., pp. 265 sqq.) ; but it\nis so important that I may perhaps be forgiven if I use yet another\nanalogical illustration to bring out the point more clearly.\nLet us suppose that our only data for characterising a burglar\nare to be derived from a full-length photograph taken at an un-\nknown distance through a distorting lens. (N.B. The distorting\nlens corresponds to the medium and the unknown distance to the\nfact that the absolute mean RT may be affected by the external\nconditions accompanying the sitting.) We cannot, since we do not\nknow the distance, or degree of distortion, determine his actual\nheight, length of forearm, breadth of head, etc. ; but we can find\nthe ratios between these quantities as '\nrendered '\nby the particular\nlens concerned, and these ratios would enable us to identify the same\nman from another similar photograph taken through the same lens,\neven though at a different distance, for the only effect of this last\nfactor would be to increase or diminish all lengths in the photograph\n\f159] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 229\nin the same proportion. But we could never identify the man from\na photograph taken with a lens which distorted in a different manner\nfrom the first, for this might elongate instead of broadening, or\nmagnify the head at the expense of the feet, etc.\nIf, however, we were dealing not with a single burglar but with\ntwo in partnership, identification of the pair (though not of either\nseparately) would be possible regardless of the different distortion\nof the second lens. In this case we should have to work with the\nratios of the ratios, instead of the ratios themselves, corresponding\n(for the purpose of the analogy) to the differences between times.\nTo take a single illustrative point :\n\u2014Suppose that photograph of\nburglar X taken with lens A showed a total height of 72 mm. and a\nhead-breadth of 6 mm., measured on the actual print, while the\ncorresponding photograph of burglar Y (taken at something like\ntwice the distance) showed a height of 33 mm. and a head-breadth\nof 3 mm. ; then the ratio Height\/Head-breadth will be 72\/6=12\nfor X and 33\/3 = 1 1 for Y, while the ratio of ratios X\/Y will be 12\/11\n.\nNow suppose that lens B is such that it expands horizontal distances\nby 50% in comparison v.'ith vertical, and the distances (which affect\naU measurements impartially) are varied so as to reduce X's measured\nheight to 60 mm. and to increase Y's to 44 mm., we should find head-\nbreadths of 7-5 and 6 mm. respectively : this leads to ratios Height\nto Head-breadth of 8 and 7-33 for X and Y respectively, neither of\nwhich is the same as that obtained with lens A ; but the ratio of these\nr?vtios, namely 8 to 7-33 is the same as before, i.e., 12 to 11. A\nsufficient number of such X\/Y ratios of ratios would enable us, in\nprinciple, to identify the pair of burglars XY with just as much\nassurance as a set of undistorted actual measurements would enable\nus to identify either of them individually.\nThe analogy is naturally not perfect\u2014no analogy is, unless it is\nso hteral a transposition of the original problem as to defeat its\nown elucidatory ends\u2014but it should serve to show both the\nnecessity for the differential method and the manner in which it\nworks.\nMoreover, once the necessity for the use of differences in RT is\ngrasped it becomes easy to understand the inherent handicap under\nwhich the method labours, namely that a much higher degree of\naccuracy in measxirement is necessary than is required for straight\nforward non-differential comparisons of individuals. An error of\none unit is only 5% in a measurement of 20 units, but it becomes\n25% if we are dealing with the difference between 20 units and 24.\nThus the part played by \" error \" is, so to say, disproportionately\nmagnified, and may bulk so large as completely to obscure the effect\n\f230 Whatehj Carington, M.A., 31. Sc. [part\nwhich it is sought to observe, even though the latter may actually\nbe present.\nNo one, of course, is to blame for this ; and it is just part of the\ninnate difficulty of the problem which no method whatever can\neliminate. On the other hand, once the point is understood, we can\nsee how it is that a procedure, which can successfully characterise\nisolated individuals and discriminate between them, may be al-\ntogether inadequate when the greater resolving power required to\nidentify a pair of personalities is called for.\nCalculation of the Main Keaction Time Results.\u20141. Sim-\nplification of the Method.\u2014Soon after I had begun the analysis of\nthese revised and additional figures on the same lines as before, I\ndiscovered that the original procedure as given me by Mr Stevens\nand discussed in Q.S.T.P. Ill, Part II, A, could be greatly simplified\narithnietically by using the quantity (J~E), where J and E stand\nfor any two corresponding entries for John and Etta respectively,\nas the working variate, and a,nalysing this in precisely the same\nmanner as was explained in connection with the study of Similarity\nin Q.S.T.P. I.\nIt has already been emphasised more than once that our problem\ncan only be dealt with by comparing the difference between two\ncommunicators as presented by medium A with their difference as\npresented by Medium B. This is what Mr Stevens' original method\nactually does, but it can be shown that identically the same numeri-\ncal results are obtained by working\nwhere x=a + b, y=a-b, a = J^-E,\u201e b = J^-E^ and J\u201e, E,,, J^, Ef,,\nstand for the reaction times for any word as obtained from J and\nE respectively through mediums A and B respectively.^\nThis corresponds precisely to the working, in the study of Simi-\nlarity, of\nW\n^ = *log,\u2014\n,\nwhere W stood for the sum of the squares of their differences from\ntheir mean of the .sums, and WP for the sum of the squares of their\ndifferences from their mean of the differences, of the reaction times\nThe use of the logarithmic transfonnation mentioned earlier merely means,\nof course, that we use the difference of the logarithms as the working variate\nand proceed as above.\n\f159] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 231\nfor the various words of the two personalities concerned. All that\nwe are doing here is to use the difference (J - E) of two times,\ninstead of a single time, in each case, in making the compari-\nson. 1\nThis modification enormously reduces the arithmetical labour\ninvolved and has been used throughout the work here described.\nExample I (p. 250) shows the full working of the data from\nSharplin and Garrett for the first twenty-five words (Group A) and\nthe third Occasion (Sitting) in each case. The left-hand column\ngives the number of the word in the list : under the heading Sharp-\nlin, columns J and E give the common logarithms (to two places\nof decimals, with the decimal point omitted and 100 subtracted) of\nthe reaction times for John and Etta obtained through Sharplin,\nrespectively : the column (J - E) shows the difference between\nthem, which is the working variate. The corresponding data for\nGarrett are given under the appropriate Garrett headings. The\ncolumns headed Sums and Diff' show, as may be verified, the sums\nand differences of the quantities (J-E). Beneath the various\ncolumns the line 8{x) shows the total of each. In computing the\nvariances of these sums and differences, we first calculate the sum\nof the squares, S(.x-) in the two columns, namely 18,364 and 22,620\nrespectively ; from these in each case we subtract the product,\niS(a;), of the mean and the total, the remainder, ii{x-x)'^, being\nthe sum of the squares of the differences from their means of the\nquantities concerned. Since there are equal numbers of entries in\nthe two columns, there is no need to divide each of these sums\nof squares by the number of degrees of freedom in order to\nobtain the mean variance ; we accordingly divide the greater by\nthe smaller, obtaining the ratio (E) between them, which here\ncomes to 1-5381. The logarithm of this quantity to base e is\nshown in the appropriate tables to be -4306, and this is what we\ncall Z.\nIt is easy to see that if the successive quantities (J - E) for\nSharpUn and Garrett had been of closely corresponding magnitudes,\nwe should have had a tendency towards large quantities with a big\nvariance under Sums and small quantities with a small variance\nunder Diff^ : this would have corresponded to a positive correlation\nbetween the values of (J - E) for the two mediums. As it is, the\nreverse is the case, indicating a negative correlation, so that the\nvariance of the Differences of (J - E) is greater than that of their\n^ Some readers may find the procedure easier to understand if it is pointed\nout that the work is formally equivalent to determining the intra-class corre-\nlation between the two series of differences (J - E),\n\f232 Whatehj Carington, M.A., M.Sc. '\n[part\nSums. We must accordingly prefix a minus sign to the Z and write\nit - -4306, as shown in the Example.\nThe actual procedure is quite simple, though the necessary\nreiteration of the word \" difference \" makes it sound difficult and\nconfusing. Perhaps it will be easier if we introduce some other term\nsuch as \"disparity\" when talking of the quantity (J-E) and try\nto bear in mind that our prol)lem is simply one of determining\nwhether the disparities between J and E as shown by one medium\nagree (positive correlation and positive Z) or disagree (negative\ncorrelation and negative Z) with those shown by another medium\nfor the same list of words.\nThe question of whether the degree of correlation shown can\nreasonably be ascribed to chance is tested in the usual way by\ndividing Z by its standard error and looking up the value of the\nprobability required in a table of normal deviates. Since there are\n25 words in a group, with 24 degrees of freedom between them, the\nvariance of z is and of Z four times this, or |, with standard error\n\u20224082. In the particular example worked, the value of the normal\ndeviate obtained by dividing Z by this quantity is only 1-055.\nReference to the appropriate table shows that a value of this magni-\ntude or greater might occur as often as about twenty-nine times in\na hundred by the operation of chance alone. It is accordingly far\nfrom being significant.\nThe Z's obtained in this way form the raw material, so to say,\nfor the second stage of our investigation, and if John and Etta\nwere autonomous entities transmitting characteristic reaction times\nundistortedly through the mediums, we should expect the values\ncalculated to be preponderantly positive. If, on the other hand,\nthere is no more than a chance relation connecting the \" disparities\n\"\n(J-E) between John and Etta in one case with those in another,\nwe should expect the Z's to be randomly distributed about a mean\nof zero and to show no particular features of interest.\n2. Primary results of the Inter-medium, comparisons.\u2014It will be\nunderstood that since data for J and E are available from three\nmediums, there are three kinds of comparison which can be made,\nnamely Leonard and Garrett, Leonard and Sharplin, and Sharplin\nand Garrett. In the case of the Feda material, only two medi-\nums are concerned, but we can use either the difference between\nFeda and John or that between Feda and Etta as the working\nvariate.\nThese main results for John and Etta are given in Table I A, and\nfor Feda in Table I b.\nIt is necessary to give these results in detail for the sake of com-\n\f159] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 233\npleteness and to assure ourselves that the effect (if any, and. of\nwhatever kind) does not vary significantly as between groups, but\nI do not expect the reader to bestow more than a passing glance on\nthem ; it will be more convenient to extract the necessary features\nfor detailed consideration as we go along. It may be noted, however,\nthat the grand total (0-24] 2) for the Leonard-Grarrett comparisons\nis faintly positive ; that for Leonard-Sharplin (\n- 0-7790) moderately\nnegative; and that for Sharplin-Garrett (-3-1239) very heavily\nnegative : also that the occasion totals (in the extreme right-hand\ncolumn) for these last data show a clear tendency to become more\nnegative on the later occasions.\nI shall discuss this curious negativity in considerable detail\nbelow ; at the moment we need only concern ourselves with the\nquestion of whether the results obtained can reasonably be attri-\nbuted to chance causes or not.\nFor this purpose I shall concentrate on the Sharplin-Garrett Z's\nof Table I a, ignoring the Leonard-Sharplin and Leonard-Garrett\nvalues as evidently non-significant by inspection.\nIt is naturally impracticable to give here a full account and\nexplanation of the methods used for testing the significance of the\nfigures, for which the reader must refer to the appropriate text-\nbooks ; the best I can do is to reproduce the actual working, so that\nit can be verified by anyone interested, and to add a few words of\nelucidation for the benefit of the semi-statistical reader.\nIgnoring the differences between groups as insignificant by in-\nspection, and concentrating on the occasion totals, we have\nOccasion Z\nI - \u20224216 -1-5 - -63240\nII - - -4386 - -5 -21930\nIII - -1-1771 \u20225 - -58855\nIV - -1-9298 1-5 - 2-89470\nTotal - -3-1239 -3-89635\nHere the Z's are copied from the Table, the use of ^-^ and the entries\nunder that heading follow Fisher's technique for the determination\nof regression coefficients, and the values in the last column are the\nproducts of those in the first two.\nDividing the two totals by the number of entries and the sum of\nthe squares of respectively, we obtain the mean and the linear\nregression coefficient of Z on occasion ; these are found to be\n- -781 and - -779 respectively. Multiplying each of these by its\ncorresponding total, we obtain the amount of variance '\nabsorbed\n'\n\f234 WJiately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nas the term is, by the mean and the regression ; these quantities\ndivided by the theoretical variance, which for a total of four Z's\nwill be I, give us two x^'s with one degree of freedom each. The\nvalues of these are about 3-660 and 4-554 respectively, and reference\nto the appropriate Tables shows that the first is very nearly signi-\nficant (P<-06) and the second quite definitely so (P^\u201403).\nTo obtain the probability that both the mean and the regression\nshould differ from their expected values of zero to the observed\nextent, or more, as the result of chance alone, we sum the two\nX''s and obtain another ^vith 2 degrees of freedom ; this\ncomes to 8-214 for which the value of P is only about 1 in 61 or\n\u20220165.\nIn other words, the results of the Sharplin-Garrett comparisons\ndeviate from expectation to an extent which would occur on the\naverage only once in rather more than sixty such collections of\n1,600 original observations, if no factor other than chance were\noperative upon the data.\nThis is a very reasonably handsome degree of significance, and\nit would still remain just above the conventional level of -05 even\nif we felt compelled, which is very doubtfully necessary as we shall\nsee below, to treat the Sharplin-Garrett comparisons as the best of\nthree antecedently equal sets. Actually, the probability of the\nresults being chance-determined is very much less than this, as we\nshall shortly see.\nIn calculating the foregoing significances we have retained the\ndivision of the data into groups\u2014a division which is quite unneces-\nsary once we have satisfied ourselves that there are no important\ndifferences between them from the point of view of the distribution\nof Z. On the contrary, it leads to an unnecessarily insensitive test\nof significance, because, speaking technically, we lose the three\ndegrees of freedom between the four groups into which each occasion\nis divided. We shall accordingly obtain a better estimate of signi-\nficance by pooling the groups for each occasion and re-working the\nZ's for each occasion as a whole.\nBefore doing this, however, I readjusted the data in respect of\nover-long times, misheard words, etc., using the occasion medians, as\nindicated on p. 225, above. I also computed suitable corrections\nto be applied equally to each member of any group, so as to deal\nwith the fact that although the intra-group regressions on order are\nnegligible the inter-group differences for a particular occasion are\nnot always so.\nTaking the Sharplin-Garrett figures only and testing significance\nprecisely as before, we have\n\f159] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 235\nOccasion z\nI - 0961 -1-5 - -14415\nII - - -1403 - -5 -07015\nIII - - -3348 -5 - -16740\nIV - - -4642 1-5 - -69630\nTotal - - -8432 - -93770\nMean - -21080 b - -18754\nAbsorbtions -17775 and -17586\nTheoretical\nVariance 4\/99\n- - 4-3993 and 4-3525\nP < -04 and < -04\nTotal absorbtion -35361\nx' -\n-\n8-7518\n1\/P - -\n79-52\nP - - < -02\nThe procedure may be followed by reference to the first evalua-\ntion. Note that the theoretical variance is now 4\/99, because the\noccasion as a whole has 100 words with 99 degrees of freedom\nbetween them. The value of P now comes to no more than about\n1 in 80, which means that even if we take the result as the best of\nthree the odds are better than 25 to I against the outcome being\nfortuitous.\nInterpretation of Negative Z's. \u2014We shall see below that even\nthe distinctly high significance just found considerably underesti-\nmates the improbability of the Sharplin-Garrett results being due to\nchance ; but I propose to leave this question on one side for the\ntime being and to attempt some discussion of the interpretation to\nbe given to the occurrence of negative Z's.\nStatistically speaking, of course, and on the hypothesis that\nchance alone is opera.tive, negative Z's are just as likely or unlikely\nto occur as positive, and if the results could fairly be ascribed to\nchance there would be nothing to occasion surprise. But this is\nnot the case and it is accordingly our duty to try to ascertain what\ninterpretation, if any, can reasonably be given to this very curious\noutcome.\nAt one time it was contended that \" no intelligible meaning\n\"\ncould be attached to a negative Z. This is definitely incorrect,\nfor there are certainly two, though I think not more than two,\nperfectly intelligible if not equally plausible explanations that can\nbe given. I shall refer to these as the hypotheses of IntercJumge\nand Interference respectively, and our next step must be to state\nthem as clearly as we can and to explain what kind of mechanism\nmust be postulated in connection with each.\n\f236 Whately Carmgton, 31. A., M.Sc. [part\nI should point out here that since both these hypotheses lead to\nthe same main result, namely negative Z's, they cannot be distin-\nguished by the methods so far described. They appear to me,\nhowever, to be conceptually distinct, even if it be argued that the\nonly effect of Interference is to produce Interchange ; and we shall\nsee below that there is some experimental reason, apart from\ngeneral considerations, for preferring the one to the other. I have\ntherefore thought it proper to discuss them separately.\na. Interchange.\u2014The hypothesis of interchange has at any rate\nthe merit of simpHcity. It postulates that, for the occasion or\ngroup concerned, the parts of J and E are interchanged by one of\nthe mediums (but not by both) either throughout or preponder-\nantly, so that when we think we are getting J's times we are really\ngetting E's, and vice verso.\nThe way in which this would operate is easily understood by\nreference to Example I. Suppose that in this group there has been\ninterchange in the case of Sharplin, but not in that of Garrett.\nThen to rectify matters we must write all the Sharplin E figures in\nthe J column and the J figures in the E column. This will have the\neffect of reversing the signs of the SharpHn (J - E) column. Then,\nsince the Garrett figures remain unaffected, the result will be to\ninterchange the figures under Sums and Diff^ This can readily be\nseen by considering the first line which will now read (the headings\nbeing just as before)\n1. 18 0 18 0 18 -18 0 -36\nThe process being continued all down the columns the total effect\nwill be to interchange the figures for Sums and Diff^ throughout, so\nthat we should end with a sum of squares of 22,48544 for the former\nand of 14,618-56 for the latter, leading to a positive Z of the same\nnumerical value as before.\nIt should be noted in passing that a purely random substitution\nof J for E and E for J times would not produce the required effect,\nbut would merely tend towards the production of Z's approximating\nto zero.\nIf we had any external reason for supposing that interchange of\nthis kind actually took place in the case of Mrs Sharplin, we should\nhave some justification for changing the signs of the Z's in all com-\nparisons in which she is concerned and claiming that the experiment\nas a whole yielded a triumphantly positive result. ^ Unfortunately,\nso far as I can see, we have no warrant for this at all ; indeed such\n^ I say \" Sharplin \" here, because inspection of Table I A will show at once\nthat it is she who appears most closely associated with negative Z's.\n\f159] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 237\ntrivial evidence as is available seems to coutra-iudicate the supposi-\ntion. To test tlie point, I asked Mr Drayton Thomas to go through\nthe Sharplin material and see whether there was any appreciable\ntendency for characteristic J responses to appear in the E lists, or\nvice versa ;\nbecause, if interchange were taking place, one would\nexpect this to happen to an appreciable extent. He could only find\nfour very doubtful instances, occurring in two negative and one\npositive groups, whereas he had previously noted four reasonably\ncharacteristic J words in their proper place. Since there are 11\nnegative groups out of 16 in the Sharplin-Garrett material, the first\nof these facts is evidently negligible, while the second tends against\ninterchange having occurred.\nThere seems, therefore, no collateral evidence to support the\nhypothesis of Interchange, while it is very difficult to imagine such\na thing taking place systematically and on the extended and in-\ncreasing scale required to produce the observed effects.\nb. Interference.\u2014This, hj'pothesis is perhaps less artificial than\nthat of Interchange, but it is not quite so simple and is correspond-\ningly more difficult to explain.\nFor those who are familiar with the notions and terminology of\nthe Analysis of Variance the point may be most easily dealt with by\nrecalling that in the original method we w6re comparing the variance\ndue to the first order interaction of conamunicator and word (CW)\nwith that due to the second order interaction of medium-communi-\ncator-word (MCW)i : alternatively, in the simplified method, we\nare comparing the variance of the differences (J-E) due to the\ndifferent words with that due to the interaction of word and medium ;\nthe fact that the last-named (MW) comes out unduly large indicates\nthat a considerable degree of medium-communicator-word inter-\naction is occurring.\nIn more ordinary language, the difference between J and E\ndepends not merely on the word but on the medium, and not merely\non the medium but on the word ; that is to say on medium and word\ntaken in conjunction. Alternatively we may say that the difference\nin reaction time between the two mediums (and we should never\nforget that it is from these that the data are actually obtained)\ndepends not only on the word used as a stimulus but also on whether\nthey are in the J or the E state.\nApproaching the problem from a slightly different angle, we may\nreflect that, since we are using the difference between the two states\nJ and E as the working variate, no relationship between the two\nmediums in trance as such, whether of positive correlation or of\n1 Cf. Q.S.T.P. III, Part II a.\n\f238 Whately Caringfon, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nnegative, can affect the result, because in so far as there may be\nanything characteristic of either medium common to both states of\nthat medium it will disappear in the subtraction. It follows that\nfor a positive correlation to be obtained it is necessary for one state\nor the other or both to affect both mediums in the same way ; and\nfor a negative result it is necessary that one or the other state or\nboth should produce opposite effects on the two mediums.\nPossibly the point will be easier to understand if we think of it\nin terms of J and E as two external sources of some kind yielding\ndifferent but characteristic sets of reactions to the various words\nof the list. Then the differences (J - E) between the two series\nobtained through the two mediums must be positively correlated,\nregardless of the influence of the mediums, provided this influence\nis impartially applied ;\nprovided, that is to say, that in respect of\nany given word each medium produces the same effect on J as on E,\nor alternatively that the effect of l)oth mediums on J (or E) is the\nsame. But it is fairly easy to see that if the two mediums produce\nopposite effects on one of the communicators, or if one medium\nproduces opposite effects on the two communicators, the resemblance\nof the two sets of differences (J - E) must be diminished and the\ndifference between them increased ; and if this is taken far enough\na negative correlation will result.\nThe process is, however, difflcult to translate from the mathe-\nmatical to the verbal form, so it will probably be better to think of\nthe negative results merely as being generated by the not detailedly\nspecified \" interaction \" of mediums, communicators and words\noperating in a fashion somewhat similar to that in which different\nsubjects might be expected to give somewhat different reactions\nin the presence of different witnesses. It will be of more interest to\nenquire whether there is any positive evidence for the operation of\ninterference of this kind.\nRegression of Z's on Mediums' Times.\u2014In considering the\npossibility of obtaining such evidence I reflected that, if either\nmedium '\ninterferes ' with the reactions, she is most likely to do so\nin respect of those words of greatest emotional significance to her\nin her normal state ; she is likely to be neutral in respect of words\nwhich strike no complex, arouse no interest and create no disturbance.\nIf this is true, then, since prolongation of reaction time is a sign\nof emotional significance, it is likely that the signs of interference,\nnamely negativity of Z's, will be most marked among words for\nwhich the medium's own reaction time is longest, and least among\nthose for which it is shortest.\nTo test this we will select wliichever medium we like\u2014Garrett,\n\f159] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 239\nsay\u2014to start with, arrange the words in the order of the reaction\ntimes obtained from her when tested on the occasion concerned in\nher normal state, break this series of 100 up into blocks of 10,\ncompute Z for each such block, and see whether there is any signi-\nficant tendency for the value of Z to vary from block to block.\n^\nWe must also, of course, do the same thing again using Sharplin as\n'\nindicator ' so to speak, and must repeat for all occasions.

[part\nIt is to be uoted here that, since the expected vahie of b is zero,\nb^\/of,^ will be a x\" with one degree of freedom in each case, so that\nthe sum of these quantities will be, for each medium, a with four\ndegrees of freedom. This is negligible in the case of Sharplin, but\ngives a significant value of 10-329 in the case of Garrett. In other\nwords, the tendency for Z's to be negative is not independent of\nGarrett's own reaction times.\nThe result is slightly surprising inasmuch as it is Sharplin, as\nwe have seen, rather than Garrett, who seems most closely associated\nwith the production of negative Z's. But the point is not of major\nimportance, for the test we have applied is, so to say, an extremely\n\u2022naive one. It seems likely on general grounds that the process of\ninterference which we are considering is some more complex function\nof the medium's own time than its actual magnitude, and still more\nlikely that it is some not altogether simple function of the two\ntimes (that is to say, of Sharplin's own time and Garrett's own time)\ntaken in conjunction. In the circumstances, the surprising thing is\nthat the test should have given a worth-while result at all rather\nthan that its outcome should not conform precisely to anticipation.\nIt is perhaps worth noting that there is here, for those who care\nto think in such terms, a strong suggestion that successful medium-\nship may consist not so much in receiving the appropriate impres-\nsions as in the ability to abstain from interfering with them. In this\ncase, we can almost see the process of distortion by the medium's\nown mental content going on ; and it may well be that the chief\ndifference between good mediums and less good is to be found in\nthe degree to which this distortion is avoided.\nCombination of the Probabilities.\u2014The treatment of the\nmain RT and that for the regression of Z on Medium's own time\nare completely rigid and yield anti-chance probabilities which may\nbe combined in the usual way.^\nThe two contributions are\nP l\/P\nFrom main ET results, combining Mean and regres-\nsion on occasion -0125 79-52\nFrom regression of Z's on Mediums' own times,\ntaking Garrett's result as the better of two - -07 14-49\nThen we have\nlog, ----- 79-52 4-37601\n\u201e----- 14-49 2-67347\nSum ------ 7-04948\nMultiplying by 2 gives ----- 14-09896\n^ I.e. by negative logarithms : cf.

Interpolating in the\nappropriate tables ^ we find P to be about -007 ; that is to say, the\nodds are more than 140 to 1 against the results of the Sharplin-\nGarrett comparisons being the outcome of chance alone.\nIn the interests of the strictest conservatism we will consider this\nas the best of three comparisons (viz. Leonard-Garrett, Leonard-\nSharplin and Sharplin-Garrett) of equal antecedent status, although,\nas I have already indicated and shall later explain, this is probably\nby no means obligatory. Using exact figures and proceeding in the\nusual way ^ we obtain P' = -02 or 1 in 50, very nearly, for the pro-\nbability that the data as a whole represent a randomly related\ncollection. This is definitely significant, and the null hypothesis\nthat there is only a chance relation between the times given in the\nJ and E states by the three mediums may be regarded as virtually\ndisproved.\nInterim Discussion of Foregoing Eesults.\u2014Without in any\nway wishing to overcall my hand, I think we may regard the out-\ncome of the study up to this point as remarkably satisfactory. It\nis true that anti-chance odds of 49 to 1 are not overwhelming ; but\nthe desire for astronomical figures is no more than a symptom\nshowing that the function of tests of significance has been imper-\nfectly understood. This function is not to '\n'prove '\nthis hypothesis\nor that, but to help us to distinguish chance generated effects from\nreal ; that is to say, to tell us how likelv it is that the effects ob-\nserved are due to uncontrollable, or at least uncontrolled, chance\nvariations of circumstance rather than to systematic causes relevant\nto our enquiry. We can never say with complete finality that any\ngiven result, no matter what the anti-chance odds may be, is\ncertainly not due to chance ; but we can tell whether it is so likely\nto be so that further enquiry on the lines concerned will probably\nbe waste of time. The conventional and purely arbitrary criterion\nusually adopted is that of one chance in twenty ; that is to say, it\nis commonly (if a trifle pusillanimously) agreed that a result is to\nbe discarded if there is more than one chance in twenty of our\nwasting our time in following it up. The odds of 49 to 1 here ob-\ntained are handsomely beyond this point, and, if we had obtained\nvery much longer odds, the only additional conclusion would have\nbeen that we had collected many more data than were necessary\nfor our purpose.\nBut actually we have done a good deal more than merely show that\n^ Fisher and Yates, Statistical Tables, p. 27.\n2 I.e. by evaluating 1 - q^, where g' is 1 and p has the value -006944 just\nfound.\n\f242 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nerrors of random sampling constitute an improbable explanation of\nthe relationships observed between the figures ; we have made\nquite appreciable progress towards discovering what sort of pro-\ncesses seem to be involved.\nIn deaUng with material of this kind, three stages are clearly\ndistinguishable. First we must ask whether the observational data\nare consistent with the null hypothesis of a chance determined\norigin ; if they are not, we must try to frame some reasonable\nexplanation for the features they are found to present ;\nfinally, we\nmust conduct some further test, either on the same data or on others\ncollected specially for the purpose, to ascertain whether this ex-\nplanation is correct. In this case we have successfully carried out\nall three stages of the work. Taking the Sharphn-Garrett figures,\nwe find odds of more than 100 to 1 against their being ascribable to\nchance alone ; we then envisaged two possible explanations of the\nmost strildng feature (negative correlation between the J-E\ndifferences) which they presented, namely Interchange and Inter-\nference, the latter being by no means implausible antecedently, but\nrather the reverse ; we went on to surmise that, if this second\nexplanation were correct, it would be unlikely for the degree of\ncorrelation to be independent of the mediums' own times ;\nfinally,\non testing this, we found significant anti-chance odds (in the case\nof Garrett) against such independence.\nTo all intents and purposes this is tantamount to saying that we\nhave shown (r\/) that the relationship between the J and E data\nobtained through the differeiit mediums is not a chance relationship,\n{h) that the curious form of negative correlation which this relation-\nship takes in the case of Sharplin-Garrett is due to interaction\nbetween the mediums and communicators (whatever these may be),\nand (c) that this interaction is of the nature of interference due to\nexcessive influence of the mediums' own mental make-up on the\nnatural J and E reactions. Further than this we cannot at present\ngo ; but to have gone so far is as much as we could look for from\nan experiment of this kind, short of an out and out positive result,\nsuch as no prudent mail would expect to obtain in Psychical\nResearch.\nCollateral Evidence.\u2014I have said above that the process of\ntreating the anti-chance probabilities evaluated as if they were the\nbetter of two attempts in the case of the association of mediums'\ntimes with degree of negative correlation, or as the best of three in\nthe case of the Sharplin-Garrett comparison as a whole, is probably\nunnecessary. The reason is that this treatment is, properly speak-\ning, only called for when the antecedent probabilities of obtaining\n\f159] The QuoMtitative Study of Trance Personalities 243\nthe effects observed are equal in the various cases considered ; and\nthis does not seem to be true here.\nIf, for example, we were concerned with tests of gustatory acuity\nand wished to ascertain whether two solutions were identical or\nnot, relying on tests involving the sense of taste alone and using\nthree subjects picked at random for the purpose, we should be\nquite right in treating any intrinsically significant result shown by\none of them as the best of three attempts, and in discounting the\nresults accordingly ; but if it were found that one of our subjects\nwas a professional tea-taster while another had had some experience\nof the kind, this would cease to be correct ; we should then attribute\ndifferences in successful discrimination not to the effects of random\nsamphng {i.e. to chance alone) but to the known differences of\nability between our subjects, and should take the most significant\nresult (presumably from the professional) at its face value. Very\nmuch the same kind of thing appUes here : we know that Mrs\nLeonard has had many years of experience and practice at whatever\nthe process is that we describe as \" communication by J and E \"\n;\nMrs Garrett, though without previous experience of J and E them-\nselves, has made something of a specialty of \" direct control \" in\ngeneral ; while Mrs Sharplin, I imderstand, has devoted compara-\ntively little attention to this branch of mediumship. Consequently,\nwhere direct control by J and E is concerned, the antecedent status\nof the three mediums is very far from equal ; on the contrary, we\nshould expect them to rank quite definitely in the order of merit\nLeonard, Garrett, Sharplin ; and we should expect any phenomenon\nof interference to be much more marked in the case of the two last-\nnamed ladies than in that of the first. And this order, as a glance\nat Table I A will show, is precisely that in which the study of the\nreaction times ranlis them.\nNow it is true that the probability of their ranlcing in this order\nas the result of chance alone is as great as 1 in 6 ; and it is also\ntrue that, since this probability cannot, a priori, assume any value\nbetween 0 and 1, it is not practicable to combine it with the pre-\nviously found overall value of 1 in 50. But it is perfectly legitimate\nto maintain either that this ranking, which is confirmed by other\nevidence given below, destroys the assumption on which the treat-\nment of the Sharplin-Garrett comparison as the best of three\ndepends, or to say that it constitutes additional evidence of the\nnon-chance character of the results, even though we are not in a\nposition to assume the exact force of its contribution. These are\nreally no more than two different ways of expressing the same\nargument ;\nbut, whichever way we look at it, it is clear that the\n\f244 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [PABT\naforementioned anti-cliance odds of 49 to 1 constitute a considerable\nunderstatement of the facts of the case.\nThis matter of the ranlving of the three mediums is well supported\nby a numerical study by Mr Drayton Thomas (unpubhshed at the\ntime of writing) of the verbal responses obtained. For the present\npurpose the following abbreviated account will be sufficient.\nMr Thomas recognises, in effect, three criteria by which the\nrelative merits of the mediums are assessed.\n(1) The first is the Ukeness of J to E as judged by the number\nof identical responses to the same stimulus word given by them\nbut hj them alone ; this is based on the assumption that the two\ncommunicators, being father and daughter and closely associated\nboth during life and after death, would have more associations in\ncommon, but not shared by others, than would two personaUties\nnot so related. The system of marking was as follows :\n\" When\nJ and B (or any other pair of personalities) give an identical response\nin reply to some stimulus, and no other personality gives it, then\nI give one mark for identity to that pair ; should they both repeat\nthat reaction to the same stimulus a further mark is given. Some-\ntimes they both repeat this reaction word a second or third time,\nwhich gains a second or third mark. It must be understood that\nno reaction is counted unless given by the one pair and by them\nonly.\" Mr Thomas appUes this procedure to each of the six pairs\nformed by the four personahties (medium, control, J, E) in each\n\" manifold \". Since there were only four Garrett sittings instead of\nfive as with Leonard and Sharplin, it will be best to give the results\nin terms of percentages of the total scores gained by the JE pair\nas compared with the mean percentage for the other pairs. The\nfigures are :\nRepetitions Total\nLeonard\n% Total score for J and E - 43-2\nMean % for other pairs - 11-4\n43-5\n11-3\n43-3\n11-3\nGarrett\n% Total score for J and E - 32-4\nMean % for other pairs - 13-5\n32-9\n134\n32-6\n.13-4\nSharplin\n% Total score for J and E\nMean % for other pairs\n20-0\n16-0\n14-9\n17-0\n18-0\n16-4\n\f159] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 245\nIt is evident that tliis test ranks the mediums Leonard, Garrett,\nSharplin in the order given.\n(2) The second criterion is that of characteristic \" responses,\nthat is to say, replies judged by Mr Thomas to be determined by\ninterests and sentiments known to have been of importance to the\ncommunicators, such as ministerial activities for J and painting\nfor E. The figures here are :\nJ E Total\nLeonard - - 38 54 92\nGarrett - - 37 45 82\nSharplin - - 4 0 4\nTotal - 79 99 178\nand the ranking is clearly as before.\n(3) Finally there is the occurrence of imique reactions, i.e.\nresponses given by J or E but by no other personality at all. This\ncriterion is based on the supposition that the bare fact of a response\nbeing \" unique \" in this sense indicates that the communicator is\ngetting through something of his own as opposed to something of\nthe medium's. The figures are :\nJ E Total\nLeonard - - 12 9 21\nGarrett - - 6 4 10\nSharplin - - 2 5 7\nTotal - 20 18 38\nHere again, though with rather less certainty, the mediums are\nranked in the same order.\nOf these results, those given by (2) are, I think, the most im-\nportant. None, however, is as unambiguous as that of the RT\nanalysis, for it would probably be possible to attribute them all\nto differences of histrionic ability without much strain. Still,\nI thinlv it fair to claim that they appreciably strengthen the view\nthat something characteristic of the communicators is being trans-\nmitted with varying degrees of success\u2014in other words, that the\norder of merit noted by Mr Thomas and given objectively by the\nRT analysis is a real one, with the implication that some process\nakin to communication \" is going on. At the very least, there can\nbe no doubt that they are entirely consonant with this hypothesis.\nAnother fact, which may fairly be reckoned as collateral evidence,\nthough not of very great force, is that, in the case of all three\n\f246 Whately Carington, M.A., M.Sc. [part\nmediums, J's mean reaction time is significantly longer than E's.\nI compute these from the group totals and find\nLeonard Gaekett Shakplin\nJohn Etta John Etta John Etta\nMean group total - 400-2 325-0 284-0 262-6 317-8 287-6\nDifE'^e of means - 75-2 21-4 30-2\ns - - - - 57-35 23-93 40-14\nt - - - - 3-709 2-529 2-128\nP - - - < -001 < -02 ~ -04\nIt will be noted that here again the three mediums appear in the\nsame order in the sharpness with which they discriminate the two\npersonalities.\nThe actual effect, though intrinsically significant in each case,\nrepresents, of course, no more than a single character of the per-\nsonalities, as it might be a single item in a set of Bertillon measure-\nments ; it is not therefore of great contributory weight, though it\nseems worth noting as a matter of general interest. On the other\nhand, the chance of all three showing a difference of the same kind\nis -25, and that of their appearing in the same order as before is -17 ;\nso that these facts constitute an appreciable, if again inassessable,\nmakeweight to the overall anti-chance odds.\nGeneral Discussion and Interpretation.\u2014The interpretation\nwhich will, in fact, be given to the results described above will\ndepend so largely on the predispositions of the interpreter that\ndiscussion of them here is almost foredoomed to be a waste of time.\nWe can, however, at least clarify the issue to the extent of deciding\nwhat we can be sure about and what not, and of examining with\nsome care, if not altogether exhaustively, the alternatives that\npresent themselves.\nThe fact to be discussed is that of finding a significant negative\ncorrelation between the values of (J - E) for the reactions obtained\non different words for the two mediums Sharplin and Garrett.\nThe alternative exflanatiom are (a) use of a faulty method, (6) com-\nputing errors, (c) chance, {d) some direct causal connection between\nSharplin and Garrett, (e) some external cause or source of the\nreactions operative upon both.\nDealing with these in order, we may at once dismiss the first,\nfor no well-advised critic will attempt to dispute the methods of\ndetermining the correlations and their regression on occasion, the\ncombination of these, or the estimation of significance, which have\nbeen employed ; nor does it need more than a glance from an\ninstructed eye to see that I have scrupulously avoided those vagaries\n\f159] The Quantitative Sttidy of Trance Personalities 247\nwhich, beset my errant if well-intentioned feet in the preparation\nof Q.S.T.P. III. The methods in question are completely orthodox\nand may be regarded as being almost as well established as the\nmultiphcation table or the use of logarithms. Moreover, as indicated\nin my preamble, I have had the advantage of consultation with the\nhighest authorities throughout the work.\nAs regards errors of computation, the work is not of a kind in\nwhich the outcome is liable to be seriously falsified by the occurrence\nof a few undetected slips. Actually, of course, all the calculations\nhave been carefully checked ; but perhaps the best assurance on\nthis point is to be found in the fact that when, at an earlier stage,\nI worked the whole of the main calculations using corrected times\nnot converted to logarithms, I obtained results substantially iden-\ntical in sense and magnitude with those here given. We may there-\nfore take it that no serious error has been introduced in this way.\nIn any ordinary sense of the words, moreover, we may regard\nchance also as ehminated ; the minimal odds against this hypo-\nthesis are 49 to 1, and actually they must be quite considerably, if\nindeterminably, greater than this. For all practical purposes we\nmay count \" chance \", which in any event is but the last refuge of\nthe destitute, as out of it.\nTo sum up thus far, in colloquial language for the sake of em-\nphasis : We are confronted with a real effect, which is not due to\nchance, to errors of method or of calculation, and must therefore\nbe explained either by the invocation of \" normal \" causes or by the\nadmission of some cause which, in the present state of our ignorance,\nwe must be content to regard as \" paranormal \".\nThe difficulty of producing any reasonably plausible explanation\non normal lines is very great. It would be bad enough if all we\nhad to account for were a negative correlation between the two\nmediums themselves, whether in trance or not ; for we could not\nget over it, as we should do in the case of a positive correlation,\nmerely by assuming that the hst of stimuli used had inadvertently\nbeen allowed to contain a number of words having a more or less\nuniversal importance ; we should be compelled to suppose in addi-\ntion, and quite gratuitously, that it contained a considerable pro-\nportion of words of two types, X and Y say, present in roughly\nequal nimibers. of which one type caused prolongation of time in\nSharplin but not in Garrett, and the other in Garrett but not in\nSharphn ^ ; in other terms, that Sharphn and Garrett were strongly\n^ X and Y may be supposed to refer to any pair of antithetic qualities such\n(just for the sake of ilhistrating somehow) as \" mascuhne \" and \" feminine \",\nor intellectual \" and \" athletic \".\n\f248 Whately Carington, 31. A., M.Sc. [part\ncontrasted or antithetic types, one giving delayed times on about\none-half of the words used (or some considerable proportion thereof)\nand the other on the other.\nThis idea, though it may sound simple enough on paper, is actually\nalmost incredible. It is, of course, perfectly possible to argue that\nany word must have, in the last analysis, predominantly X or Y\nconnotations, whatever X and Y may stand for ; but it is only\npossible to do this from what I may term a \" pubUc \" or general\nstandpoint, and it does not in the least follow from any such argu-\nment that the words concerned have predominantly the same X\nor Y connotations for both Sharplin and Garrett ;\nyet this further\nassumption of an extensive degree of word to word correspondence\nis necessary in order to explain any observed correlation.\nBut the effect actually observed is very much more difficult to\nexplain than this, because we have carefully employed a differential\nmethod, taking the value (J - E) as the working variate, in order\nto eliminate any correlation between the two mediimis, whether\npositive or negative, which might result from or remain in the\ntrance state as such. Consequently, we cannot suggest, as otherwise\nwe might be tempted to do (though we should not thereby evade\nthe difficulty just mentioned) that the process of going into trance\nautomatically brought out latent characteristics of the mediums\nnot observable in their normal states. It must be something to do\nwith the intrinsic J-ness or E-ness of one or other of the two states\nor both that is responsible for the effect, and I see no way of attach-\ning any kind of intelligible meaning to such terms except by postu-\nlating some kind of external source or factor capable, so to say, of\nsetting its own individual imprint on the reactions of the trance\nstates concerned, while the fact that this factor interacts with the\ntwo mediums in such a way as to lead to a negative instead of\nthe more natural positive correlation does not make it less necessary\nto conclude that it is in some sense external. In fact it makes it,\nif anything, more necessary, because, while we might by a sufficient\nstretching of the imagination suppose that a diUgent getting up of\nthe parts of J and E by two adequately accompUshed actresses\nmight conceivably result in a positive correlation of the differences\nbetween the two renderings, even in so recondite a respect as the\nreaction times given to a particular list of words, we really cannot\nplausibly suggest that a significant negative correlation could pro-\nceed from any such process, however far it might be carried.\nI should feel happier if the whole experiment could be repeated\nwith an entirely new list of words, but particularly the Sharplin-\nGarrett part of it ;\nindeed, one might say that this last is definitely\n\f159] The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities 249\nnecessary in order to consolidate our results, since we have no satis-\nfactory replication so far. I should also like to see the same experi-\nment tried out with two or three good stock-company actresses\nwho had studied the characters of J and E so far as published and\nknown material permits, and were trying to project themselves into\nthose characters while under test.\nSuch remarks, however, referring respectively to a confirmation\nand a sidelight, should not be taken as minimising the importance\nof the results actually obtained, which I believe to be considerable.\nThis is not to say that I regard the autonomy of J and E to be\n\" proved \" or even \" established \" by this experiment. So far as this\nwork is concerned, the spirits, if I may put it so, remain a good many\ndegrees below proof. On the other hand, I think that only ignorance\nor bigotry could deny that the case for the operation of some non-\nchance non-medium factor, that is to say an external factor, and\ntherefore for the \" autonomy \" in question, is very greatly strength-\nened by the results obtained, as compared with what would have\nbeen the case if we had obtained insignificant results conforming\nto the null hypothesis that there is no connection between the\nmediums other than chance alone.\nThe natural and obvious explanation of the phenomena as a\nwhole, from the orthodox standpoint, would be that the entranced\nmediums are highly suggestible and need little inducement to adopt\nhistrionic poses representing, as best they may, the personalities of\nthe supposed \" communicators \". If this were so, we should expect,\nit is true, that the general behaviour of the mediums in the relevant\nstates of control would be broadly coloured in conformity with\nknown characters of the persons concerned, but we certainly should\nnot expect this to be carried out in such minuteness as is involved in\ndifferences of reaction times to common words of no particular\npublic interest ; such details, we should certainly imagine, would be\nfilled in in accordance with the personal idiosyncrasies of the\nmediums.

Thouless\nSome years ago I attempted a repetition of Dr Rhine's experiments\non extra-sensory perception. I have hesitated to pubhsh the\nresults since the numbers were small and I knew that Dr Soal was\ncarrying out a much more complete experiment in London. Since,\nhowever, my experiments have sometimes been quoted and since\nthey throw some light on statistical questions raised in connection\nwith Rhine's work, it seems worth while to publish a short report of\nthe results.\nThe experiments of Rhine are now so well known as not to need\ndetailed description. There is a pack of 25 cards with five different\ndesigns (circle, star, rectangle, waves and cross) and five specimens\nof each design in the pack. The subject is required to guess which\nof the five designs is printed on the face of each card in the pack,\nthe face of the card being invisible to him. If he is merely guessing,\nit is expected that he will, on the average, get five right in each pack.\nIf he gets significantly more than five right under conditions which\npreclude any normal means of gaining knowledge of the design, this\nis taken to be evidence that he has some power of extra-sensory\nperception (E.S.P.), that is of telepathy or clairvoyance or both\naccording to the conditions of the experiment.\nMy experiments were carried out under various conditions.\nGenerally the face of the card was visible to the experimenter and\nthe back visible to the subject if he cared to look at it. Some\nexperiments were witnessed but the majority were not. The subject\nwas sometimes not informed of successes until the pack was finished,\nbut more generally he was told after each successful guess. One\nseries (with myself as subject) was done by the '\npure clairvoyance\n'\nmethod. The conditions were generally not as rigid as would be\nrequired for crucial experiments but my intention was to introduce\nrigid control of conditions if positive results began to appear. At\nno stage was there any sign of positive results, so the experiments\nare here reported all together without any distinction of conditions.\nIn the Table below, I show the number of times each subject gets\n0 right in a series of 25, the number of times he gets 1 right, etc.\nThis seems better than Rhine's method of merely reporting total\nresults, since this method would show if the capacity appeared\nsporadically and rarely. Also it demonstrates the actual distribution\nof successes.\n\f159] Extra-Sensory Perception 253\nTABLE OF RESULTS\nSubject\n0 1 2 3\nNumber Right\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\nTotal Expected\nTotal\nS.T. 0 0 0 1 3 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 49 50\nM.D. 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 20 20\nD.D. 0 0 1 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 15 20\nP.T. u 0 0 5 5 8 0 2 1 1 0 0 106 110\nJ.S. 0 1 0 2 2 3 3 4 1 0 0 0 84 80\nM.L. 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 16 20\nE.L. 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 18 20\nW.B. 0 1 1 5 3 7 4 3 0 0 0 0 110 120\nE.T. 0 0 4 4 7 6 5 3 3 2 0 0 171 170\nA.C. 0 4 7 7 22 19 18 13 5 4 1 0 507 500\nR.T. 0 1 3 3 2 5 1 4 1 0 0 0 91 100\nW. 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 30 30\nyj\n1\n\u00b1 9 1 1 0 0 n 1 A\nu 9A\nY. 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 32 30\nZ. 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 30 30\nTotals 0 7 22 35 50 56 40 34 11 8 2 1 1305 1330\nIf nothing but chance were operative in producing the above\nresults, we should expect that the numbers in the bottom row would\nbe distributed in close agreement with the numbers obtained by\nthe expansion of the expression N(4\/5 + l\/5)-^ (where N is the\nnumber of series of 25 guesses). The numbers observed and expected\non this hypothesis are shown below.\n<2 2345 6 7 89 >9\nObserved - 7 22 35 50 56 40 34 11 8 3\nExpected - 7-3 18-9 36-1 49-7 52-2 43-5 29-5 16-6 7-8 4-6\nDeviation\nfromexpn. - -3 + 3-1 - M + -3 +3-8 -3-5 +4-5 -5-6 +-2 -1-6\nThese are only such deviations from expectation as might be\nexpected to occur by chance. This may be tested by summing the\nsquares of the deviations divided by the expected niunber in each\nclass and so obtaining the quantity which turns out to be 4-25, a\nvalue which will be exceeded by chance alone in about nine observa-\ntions in ten. Agreement with the expected logarithmic distribution\non the hypothesis that no subjects were showing extra-sensory\npower is, therefore, perfectly satisfactory.\nThe same conclusion emerges if we examine the mean score and\nstandard deviation. If chance alone were operative, the expected\n\f254 Robert H. Thouless\nmean number of successes would be, of course, 5, aud, if the scores\nwere distributed on the expected logarithmic curve, the standard\ndeviation should be exactly 2. The observed mean is 4-906 and\nthe observed standard deviation is 1-93. The standard errors of\nthese are -23 and -16 respectively, so in each case the observed\ndeviation from expectation is a httle less than half the standard\ndeviation and the probabihty of chance occurrence is between -6\nand -7.\nAgreement with the chance hypothesis is unquestionable, there-\nfore, either when the results are treated in mass (as in the last\nparagraj^h) or when we consider (as in the earher calculation) expec-\ntations of given numbers right in separate series of 25 guesses.\nThe advantage of considering expectation in separate series of\n25 is that it might reveal the presence of extra-sensory perception\neven if it occurred so rarely as to be swamped by chance results in\nthe total. It remains possible that E.S.P. occurs sporadically over\nperiods not long enough appreciably to affect whole series of 25, but\nlong enough to affect shorter sequences. If this were the case,\nneither of the previous tests might reveal its presence but it might\nbe shown by a tendency for successive guesses to l)e right more\noften than one would expect in a random distribution. I, therefore,\ncounted the number of single right guesses, of two successive right\nguesses and so on.\nThe mean chance expectation of k successive right guesses can be\neasily shown to be (26 - \/i:)\/5''= in each series of twenty-five guesses\nif the probabihty of each single guess being correct is 1\/5. From\nthis formula, we can find that the mean chance expectation of series\nof only k successive right guesses {i.e. of a series of h right guesses\nwhich is not part of a series of more than k right) is\n(424-16A-)\/5\nfor all values of k up to 24.\nFrom this formula, we can compare ol)served and expected\nnumbers of single right guesses, of pairs of right guesses, etc., in any\nnumber of series of 25 guesses. I have counted these for the first\n241 series of 25 with the following result :\nConsecutive right guesses 1 2 3 4 5 >5\nObserved - - - 778 150 26 5 1 0\nExpected - - - 786-6 151-2 29-0 5-55 1-06 -25\nIt is clear that there is no tendency for an excess of sequences of\nright answers such as might be caused by occasional bursts of\nE.S.P. capacity.\n\f159] Extra-8ensory Perception 253'\nAll tests, therefore, show that these results are such as are to be\nexpected on the hypothesis that no E.S.P. power was shown by any\nof the subjects. I do not wish it to be supposed that I am claimmg\nthat these are evidence against the reahty of Rhine's results. A\nnegative result by one worker cannot be regarded as a disproof of a\npositive result obtained by another if the positive result has been\nobtained under satisfactory experimental conditions.\nI think that the results do show that the hope that Rhine has\ndiscovered an easily repeatable technique for demonstrating E.S.P.\nis not fulfilled. It is true that the number of cases is not large, but\nin the prelimmary experiments reported in Rhine's first book, some\nindication of positive results emerged from shorter series than this.\nThe question of the repeatabihty of Rhine's experiments depends\nmuch more on Dr Soal's extended series of experiments than on my\nown short one.\nOn one important point, I think I can give some support to Rhine.\nSome o\u00a3his critics have doubted whether he was correct in assuming\n2\/5 X >\/N as his standard error in a random distribution. One critic,\nat least, even doubts whether 5 is the mean chance expectation of\nnumber right per pack of 25. My results appear to be due solely to\nchance and both the mean of 4-906 and the standard deviation of\n1-93 are not significantly different from the expectations assumed\nby Rhine of 5-0 and 2-0 respectively.\nIt is true that the fact that there are 5 cards of each kind in each\npack will tend to reduce the standard deviation unless subjects\nguess exactly five of each kind also (obviously if subjects always\nguessed the same card throughout a suit, the standard deviation\nwould be zero, although the mean chance expectation of five right\nwould remam. unchanged). The formula for allowing for this effect\nhas been given by Dr Stevens in a recent pubhcation. Since, how-\never, this effect would reduce the standard deviation and, therefore,\nthe standard error, the ignoring of it is a mistake on the right side\nsuice it causes the significance to be underestimated. In my experi-\nments, at least, the effect of a non-equal distribution of guesses\nbetween the five suits seems to be neghgibly small. In any case,\nthis effect would reduce the standard deviation and, therefore, the\nstandard error, so, in ignoring it, we are making a mistake on the\nright side, which will lead only to an underestimation of the signifi-\ncance of the evidence.\nThat my failure to reproduce Dr Rhine's result may have been\ndue to failure to reproduce his conditions, I am, of course, willing\nto admit. The necessity for certain conditions not reproducible by\na conscientious and experienced experimenter is, however, a factor\no\n\f256 Robert H. Thouless Extra-Sensory Perception [part\ninterfering with repeatability of the experiment. If E.S.P. is a\ngenuine phenomenon, it is to be hoped that investigators of it will\nso standardise the conditions, that the results can be repeated in\nany laboratory.\nThere is one point about the conditions which I should hke to\nemphasise. It was always my wish to keep the subjects in a state\nof beheving that they were getting positive results. Some were,\nfrom the begimiing, unbeheving, but, ia many cases, this condition\nappeared to be fulfilled. It is made easy by an important psycho-\nlogical factor, that people generally expect deviations from mean\nchance expectation in a random series less frequently than they\nactually occur. The most naive subjects were strongly impressed\nby their success iu getting even five right out of twenty-five and the\nless naive were strongly impressed if they got nine or ten right and\nsuch an experience would keep them encouraged through many\nseries in which less than mean chance expectation was obtained.\nIt was iudeed easy to encourage subjects to beheve that they had\n'\ngood ' and '\nbad ' days, although the alternations of several\nsuccessful series with several unsuccessful ones turned out, on\ncritical examination, only to be such as would occur in a random\nseries. I may have failed to reproduce some essential condition for\nsuccessful demonstration of E.S.P. but I do not think it was lack\nof faith in my subjects. With a httle care, this is one of the easiest\nconditions to produce in most subjects who do a number of sets of\nguesses.\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 257\nA PROXY EXPERIMENT OF SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS\nBy C.

Drayton Thornas [part\nFrederic William Macaulay\nIn June 1936 Professor E. K. Dodds suggested that I should try to\nobtain mformation at my sittings for a scientist friend of his and\nsent me the following information to work upon :\nWilfred Stanley Lewis of Exeter requests a communication\nfrom his father-in-law.\nFinding that it would be some time before I could undertake this\nexperiment at my sittings with Mrs Leonard I promised to try with\nanother sensitive.\nProfessor Dodds (unknown to me) wrote to Professor Lewis as\nfollows :\n\" The friend who undertook to try for a proxy sitting on your\nbehalf has arranged one for Tuesday next, June 16, with a new\nmedium, not Mrs Leonard. The medium is not to be told the pur-\npose of the sitting, but I have asked my friend to concentrate before\nthe sitting on the following '\nrequest ', \u2014Wilfred Stanley Lewis of\nExeter requests a communication from his father-in-law. My\nfriend has been told nothing whatever about you except that you\nare a distinguished man of science and that your wife has had super-\nnormal experiences and has had successful sittings with other\nmediums. It seems to me that it might help, and could do no harm,\nif your wife put up a '\nrequest ' on her own to one or both of your\nfathers-in-law to communicate at this sitting.\"\nThat sitting was a complete failure and in reporting this to\nProfessor Dodds I wrote :\n\" I will try if possible to get something with Mrs Leonard pre-\nsently ; could you get me a rather better clue meanwhile. Merely\nto ask my people to find the father-in-law of Mr Wilfred Stanley\nLewis of Exeter does not help much, as it omits the name of the\nrequired person. Suppose you were asked to find the father-in-law\nof anyone named as living in London, and the required individual\nwere said to be resident in Birmingham, you would be puzzled how\nto proceed!\n\" Perhaps you could get me the name and the month of decease.\nThat might suflice.\"\nNote.\u2014I was unaware that the desired communicator had been\nconnected with Birmingham, and named that city in the above\nillustration only because that was where Professor Dodds was then\nresiding.\nTo this letter he replied on June 21, 1936 :\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 259\n\" The person from whom a communication is desired in the Lewis\nexperiment is Frederic William Macaulay, who died May 20, 1933.\nHe was for the greater part of his life associated with Birmingham\n(but was not known to me). It is suggested that the '\nrequest\n'\nshould be presented as coming from his daughter '\nEmma '\n(Mrs\nLewis), rather than from his son-in-law, whom he did not know so\nintimately. They suggest also that if a communicator emerges who\nmight be identified as this F. W. Macaulay, the following question\nmight (if opportunity offers) be put to him at the sitting :\n'\nCan you\ntell me anything of the two men with whom you were so closely\nassociated in your last unfinished piece of work?\nIt is important to remember, while reading the following account,\nthat the above includes everything known to me up to the end of\nthe fourth sitting ;\nalso that neither Mrs Lewis nor her husband\nhad had any intercourse with Mrs Leonard. Their earlier sittings\nwith Mrs Brittain, to which reference is made below, have never\nbeen published.\nNo mention of the proposed experiment was made, either to Mrs\nLeonard or to Feda her Control. The method I adopted was one\nwhich had often led to success in proxy cases, and included an\nappeal to the desired communicator in my study at home.\nMy sittings for the first part of the experiment were taken on the\nfollowing dates :\nJune 26, 1936, comprising paragraphs 1-22 in the record.\nJuly 24, \u201e \u201e \u201e 23-44 \u201e\nAug. 21, \u201e \u201e \u201e 45-51 \u201e\nSept. 25, \u201e \u201e \u201e 52-80 \u201e\nAt the first of these sittings Feda introduced a new communicator\ntvithout any leading on my part. When she announced a stranger's\npresence I remarked that I had invited someone. After the steno-\ngrapher had taken down 14 items of an apparently evidential char-\nacter I named Frederic William Macaulay as the person from whom\nI was hoping to hear. This I did to make sure of being on the right\ntrack ; for it seemed unwise to waste time in uncertainty. Feda\nstoutly insisted that we had the person I desired.\nMr Macaulay had been a water-engineer interested in hydraulics.\nFrom messages given in the above sittings I select some references\nto this occupation, as also to other of his interests and to certain\narticles which he had been in the habit of using.\n\f260 C.

He\nholds this instrument carefully, measuring something on\nit, and holds it flat and then holds it up as if looking for a\nmark.\n(Might be a 2 ft. steel ruler, mounted on rollers and with\nadjustable pointer that could be screwed into position\nwhich my father always used (see sketch).)\nRoller\n^ Pointer Roller\n-Q\nScrew B\u2014\nFeda : About the two men he was working with ; one was much\nlinked with him over this instrument which they used in\ndoing special work together.\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 261\n(One of the two men in particular was often in my father's\ndrawing of6.ce with him.)\nHe shows something like a table, long and rather narrow\nfor its length.\n(The drawing ofl&ce had a long narrow table.)\nThey don't seem to be sitting, but standing near this\nbench, bending over it a little.\n(The table was built to stand at and not to sit at.)\nArtificial light hangs over it and is adjustable.\n(There were adjustable lights over this table.)\nAnd I hear glass ; he makes me hear the tinkle of glass\nand metal.\n(The glass might be his glass tracing table.

Drayton Thomas [part\nAt the time of the sitting I supposed that both the above referred\nto the same place, but it now seems probable that recollection of the\nintended visit to Southend, or possibly similarity in name, brought\nup memory of Southampton, which place the British Waterworks\nAssociation had visited during its Meeting at Bournemouth in June\n1932. Mr Macaulay had attended that meeting.\nDate of sitting, September 25, 1936.\nFeda : He shows me some books, not ordinary printed or reading\nbooks, but books with his own handwriting in, as if he had\n4\/55 made an awful lot of notes. I am seeing the \" R \" again\nand I think the notes would be in connection with this\nname \" R \".\n(He did leave a mass of written notes about his work on\nreservoirs.)\nFeda : To do with his worlv. I feel a very strong light and a\ncounter or bench and a peculiar looking instrument which\n4\/61 I should think his daughter would know. It has a long\narm to it through which a little piece is sticking out, and\nthat piece goes up and down a little like a balance. It feels\nvery much like a weight thing, but not a big thing like\npeople stand on. He doesn't put weights on though, he\nseems to put on it glasses and bits of metal. It is important.\n(When I began to read the description of this instrument\nI at once thought of an appliance which he frequently used\nin his earlier work to test the strength of concrete. Blocks\nof concrete were put in at a a and subjected to an in-\ncreasing stress till they fractured. He would examine the\npieces by a good Ught after breakage. Glass played no\npart in the process.)\nMrs Lewis added the accompanying sketch :\no\nFeda : There is another thing he does : he makes funny figures\nand writes things down, not like 1, 2, 3, but different\n4\/63 figures that mean something, and he writes them in funny\n\f169] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 263\nh\nI\nI\n-\nI .\n[r\nI\ni\nFeda :\n1\/3\nFeda :\n1\/4\nFeda :\n1\/8\nFeda :\n1\/9\nFeda :\n1\/10\nways. They are like the Signs of the Zodiac, like the\nwriting on the parchments in the East.\n(My father did a good deal of research in hydraulics, in\nwhich subject Greek letters are used as well as figures.\nThis may be an attempt to convey the notation of the\nsubject. He often discussed his work with my brother and\nmyself, jotting down formulae and so forth on odd scraps\nof paper as he talked.)\nPersonal Memories\nDate of sitting, June 26, 1936.\nHe went rather quickly, and didn't think he was going ;\nas if he felt \" I have things to do and hope to live on and\ndo them \". Disappointed at having to go.\n(He was advised to have an operation for the removal of\ngall stones. Was working as usual on May 18, 1933, and\nwas dead by the morning of May 21. The attitude de-\nscribed above echoes a hope he expressed to me that he\nstiU had many years to go, as there was so much interesting\nwork to be done.)\nInterrupted when he was writing important instructions\njust before he passed.\n(Written instructions about work and the general disposi-\ntion of his alfairs were left unfinished.)\nHe had a presentation not long before he passed over, with\na name and certain details inscribed on it.\n(He had a presentation, accompanied by an illuminated\naddress ; this was in 1930, exactly three years before his\ndeath.)\nHe was liked in two ways, in his work and in a hobby.\nThis second string to his bow he did not do for money.\nIt was good work for which people were grateful. When\nhe passed there was pubhc mention made of this.\n(He used to say that he had two hobbies,\u2014his work as an\nengineer and the work of helping young engineers. He\nhad many tributes from young men whom he had assisted\nin a variety of ways.)\nHas his daughter a special cup that he drank from and\nthat he could show to people, or people might ask to see?\nNot an ordinary thing.\n(He had several silver tankards which he won shooting at\n\f264 C. Drayton Thomas [part\nBisley. He drank from these. Each, of his five children\nhas one now.)\nFeda : He had not been well for two or three years, but did not\n1\/11 regard it seriously.\n(Some two years before his death my father began to have\nattacks of pain in his back and side. His doctor dismissed\nthem as lumbago until shortly before his death, when a\nspecialist was consulted and diagnosed the presence of\ngall stones. My father did not worry much until the last\nsevere attack when the specialist was called in.)\nFeda : Two months before the end he had disquieting symptoms\nthat seemed serious, but it was only a short time before\nhis passing that he realised its seriousness. He says,\n\u2014\n\" My heart seemed very tired,\" something affected it.\n(Two months before the end he spoke rather despondently\nto his son-in-law about \" always feeling tired \", and said\nthat it was a great happiness to know that, should he not\nhave much longer to live, his children were all settled and\nhappy.)\nFeda : He began life in one place, then spent the rest of it in a\n1\/19 very different kind of place. Very different conditions\nbetween them.\n(He spent his boyhood in the West Indies and the rest of\nhis life in England or Ireland.)\nDate of sitting : July 24, 1936.\nFeda : His daughter has been a little stirprised, hasn't she, about\nsomething in a material way? Something he had not\n2\/33 got? Something financial that he had not got, which she\nthought he had got,\u2014that he had not left something. As\nif she said, \" Why hasn't he got it? \" One particular\nthing, not quite so much of it as they expected. But in\nanother way there was. They would not be unduly worried\nbecause other things made it balance, but they would be\npuzzled.\n(Correct. We did wonder where money which had come\nfrom one particular source had gone. But things did\n\" balance \". My father had inherited about \u00a36,000 from\na great aunt. We knew that he had had certain losses\nduring the Great War from money invested abroad ; but\nthis particular sum was invested at home and we did not\nknow, imtil after his death, that he had realised the capital\nand used it\u2014chiefly to help needy friends and relations.\n\fA Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 265\nAt the same time \" Things did balance \" in the sense that\nmy mother, though she could not enjoy the income from\nthis sum, was left very comfortably off. And the family\nfelt it was quite fair as much of the money had been spent\non a relative of hers, and some to pay off her own debts.)\nSets of boxes. He had what he calls a nest or set of boxes\nthat he was very interested in, and he used to keep things\nin them. Several of them and they all seem to fit into\neach other, to fit in together into something that looks\nlike a case over them. It seems important to him. I\ndon't thinlv they were all full.\n(His treasured tool chest was a nest of drawers. He\ndelighted in tinkering about the house and garden, and\nalways kept all tools, nails, screws, and so forth in perfect\norder.)\nDate of sitting : August 21, 1936.\nThere is also a John and a Harry, both with him. And\nRace . . . Rice . . . Riss ... it might be Reece but sounds\nlike Riss, and Francis. These are all names of people who\nwere connected with him or linked up with him in the\npast, connected with happy times. I get a feeling of an\nactive and busy home in which he was rather happy.\n(This is a very curious passage, taken in conjunction with\n\" they are connected with rather happy times. I get a\nfeeling of an active and busy home in which he was rather\nhappy.\" Probably the happiest time of my father's life\nwas in the four or five years before the war, when we, his\nfive children, were all at school, and the home was packed\nwith our friends during the holidays. John, Harry and\nFrancis could be three of these. Francis is certainly dead\n\u2014I do not know about John and Harry. But the most\ninteresting passage is \"It might be Reece but it sounds\nlike Riss \". This carries me back to a family joke of these\npre-war days. My elder brother was at school at Shrews-\nbury and there conceived a kind of hero-worship for one\nof the \" Tweaks \" (sixth form boys) whose name was\nRees. He wrote home about him several times and always\ndrew attention to the fact that the name was spelt \" Rees\n\"\nand not \" Reece \". In the holidays my sister and I used\nto tease him by singing \" Not Reece but Riss \" until my\nfather stopped us, explaining how sensitive a matter a\nyoimg boy's hero-worship was. I think Rees was killed\n\f266 \"\nC. Drayton Thomas ' \" [pabt\nin the Great War. He was never at our house, but we had\nhim carefully pointed out to us whenever we were at\nShrewsbury. This Reece-Riss reference is quite charac-\nteristic of other sittings I have had in which have been\nmade quaint little references to small matters that yet are\nimportant with reference to my father.)\nDate of sitting : September 25, 1936.\nFeda : This gentleman would have had pains in his limbs? I get\n4\/56 rather a stiff feeling and aches in the limbs. Something\nhe suffered from in later years.\n(These were symptoms of his last illness.)\nFeda : Also a peculiar feehng in one hand too. Will you ask his\ndaughter if there was something about one hand that made\n4\/57 it uneasy sometimes. Something not quite right with one\nhand. I feel he had done something to one hand that\nwould make it a little different from an ordinary person's\nhand.\n(About a year before his death he had severe blood poison-\ning in one hand. I believe it was always tender after-\nwards.)\nFeda : I get a funny word now . . . would he be interested in . . .\nbaths of some kind? Ah, he says I have got the right\n4\/67 word, baths. He spells it B A T H S. His daughter will\nunderstand, he says. It is not something quite ordinary,\nbut feels something special.\n(This is, to me, the most interesting thing that has yet\nemerged. Baths were always a matter of joke in our\nfamily\u2014my father being very emphatic that water must\nnot be wasted by our having too big baths or by leaving\nthe taps dripping. It is difficult to explain how intimate\na detail this seems. A year or two before his death my\nfather broadcast in the Midland Children's Hour on \" Water\nSupply \" and his five children were delighted to hear on\nthe air the familiar admonitions about big, wasteful baths\nand dripping taps. The mention of baths here also seems\nto me an indication of my father's quaint humour, a\ncharacteristic which has hitherto been missing. I should\nadd that, as Water Engineer to a city where the water\nconsumption was very great and at times in excess of the\nsupply, my father was very interested in baths, taps and\nall distribution fittings. He was a member of a Committee\nwhich standardised the two latter, and persuaded his Water\n\f159] A Proxy Experime7it of Significant Success 267\nCommittee to adopt these standardisations. He also\nadvocated the installation in new houses of small baths.)\nMrs Lewis wrote later : '\"I think the missing characteristic, his\nwhimsical humour, emerged in this Baths reference.\" This refers\nto a remark in one of her previous letters to Professor Dodds, that,\nin the first sittings, she missed one of her father's characteristics.\nWhat this characteristic was she did not state until writing the above\ncomment.\nFriends and Acquaintances\nDate of sitting : June 26, 1936.\nFeda : The man whose daughter wants to hear about him is here\nand someone called Alfred is linked up with him and is\n1\/15 very important to him. A \" T \" and a \" J \" connected\nwith him. There is something about this man Alfred that\nI think will be very interesting.\n(Alfred, who died many years ago, was probably his closest\nyoung friend after his own relations. Alfred's second\nChristian name began with \" T \" but I have no means of\nfinding out if \" J \" apphed to him also.)\nDate of sitting : July 24, 1936.\nFeda : There is a man James near him, not on the earth. James\n2\/26 passed over some time before him. He likes being with\nhim very much.\nFeda : James again, and with him comes a lady called Mary.\n2\/30\nFeda : You said his name was Macaulay. Well, he is giving me\nanother Mac name, but not that. Somebody he was very\n2\/31 close to on earth, very near indeed, and his daughter will\nknow whom he means. She has been thinking something\nabout this Mac person a httle while ago.\n(James McCance had a daughter Mary who died a few\nmonths ago.)\nMrs Lewis wrote more fully at a later date, i.e. November 23,\n1937, when the whole experiment had ended, regarding her father's\nfriendship and affection for his cousin James McCance :\n(I do not think I have sufficiently emphasised the very\nclose friendship that existed between him and James\nMcCance. After his father, mother, grandmother and\nbrother, James would have been by far the most likely\n\f268 C. Drayton Thomas [part\nperson for liini to seek out. They were, indeed, more at\none in their tastes than my father was with the other\nrelations I have mentioned ; the tie with them was more\npurely affectionate. Next to James and Ernest would\nprobably come Alfred who was always called \" Fred \" or\n\" Freddie \" by my father. These two are both friends of\nhis youth and middle age.)\nFor the names Alfred and Ernest see paragraphs 1\/15,\n5\/91 (pp. 267, 271).\nDate of sitting, September 25, 1936.\nFeda : There is a very old man with him who passed a good bit\nbefore he himself did, one much linked up with him and\n4\/66 who would be interested to meet him again. Quite an old\nman and very white.\n(The description could apply to my father's first \" chief\"\nJames.)\nBefore he passed he would have been what you call a bit\ndoddery. This old man would have been in bed for some\nweeks before passing ; some people would find him rather\ndifficult, but he was very clever and rather an unusual\nsort of man, rather peculiar. This F. W. gentleman knew\nhim very well. Now they have many things to talk about.\n(I have heard my father say that James was becoming\n\" doddery \" before his death. He also said how very\n\" difiicult \" some people found him. Mr Drayton Thomas\nspoke my father's name the wrong way round, but Feda\nhas the initials in the correct order. I mention this\nbecause my father hated to have his name incorrectly\narranged.)\nYes, I had inadvertently given the name as WiUiam Frederick\nMacaulay. It may be of interest to remark that the full name had\nbeen spoken by me to Feda only twice, and that was during the\nfirst sitting three months before.\nFeda :\n\" Minster \" or something-minster. Please ask the daughter\nif she remembers a name that would be famihar to him,\n4\/68 and it is something-minster. Minster isn't all the word,\nI feel I am missing part of it. Sometimes there is a con-\nnection between what they have just said and what they\ngo on to. If people took the trouble they could always\ntrace the possible connections.\n(The James referred to above, and no connection with\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 269\nJames McCance of 2\/31, had his offices in Victoria Street,\nWestminster. My father worked there for a few years\nand was later his assistant engineer in the provinces for\nmany more years ;\nmoreover, when my father retired\nfrom his post in Birmingham, he became partner in the\nfirm of Rolf & Rafferty of Westminster.)\nFeda : He is trying to give me something to do with eyesight or\neyes. It wasn't so bad, but there was worry over it.\n4\/69-70 Godfrey ; will you ask the daughter if she remembers\nsomeone called Godfrey. That name is a great link with\nold times.\n(My father's most trusted clerk, one who specially helped\nin the hydraulic research, was called Wilham Godfrey.\nHe was with my father for years and I remember him from\nalmost my earhest childhood. He has recently been\ngravely ill and my father would certainly be interested\nin his progress. The reference to eyesight might possibly\nrefer to this Godfrey who did have great trouble with his\neyes latterly. At the same time my father also complained,\ntowards the end of his life, that reading and close work\ntired his eyes excessively and gave him headaches. It\nwas a very common gesture of his at this time to take oS\nhis glasses and rub his eyes, a thing I had not seen him\ndo before though he had worn glasses for years.)\nFeda : What is that? . . . Peggy . . . Peggy . . . Puggy ... he is\ngiving me a little name like Puggy or Peggy. Sounds like\n4\/79 a special name, a little special nickname, and I thinli it is\nsomething his daughter would know. Poggy, Puggy or\nPeggy. I think there is a \"\ny \" on it.\n(My father sometimes called me \" pug-nose \" or \" Puggy\".)\nResult of First Four Sittings\nOut of the 94 items given during four sittings this communicator\nwas successful 70 times. Such a proportion of accuracy\u201474-4 per\ncent.\u2014places the result beyond anything attributable to chance\ncoincidence.\nProfessor Dodds suggested an original system for marking these\nrecords. We used his method independently and then compared\nour results. We were in agreement save that he had given a slightly\nlower mark for items relating to the communicator's interest in\nengineering. This he did on the assumption that such interest\nmight have been assumed by the medium or Feda after the first\n\f270 C. Drayton Thomas [part\nreference to engineering. I did not lower the marking for these\nbecause, at the time they were given, neither Feda nor I had any\ninkling that they were true to fact. The net result of this small\ndifference in our valuation is, however, almost negligible. Hence\nit seems simpler to use, for this paper, my own marking in which\n\" Right, Good, Fair \" are counted as successful, while \" Poor,\nDoubtful, Wrong \" are failures.\nThe numerical analysis of the four sittings is :\nRight - 36 Poor - 2\nGood - 10 Doubtful 19 Total Number op Items 94\nFair - - 24 Wrong - 3 Successes, 74-4 per cent.\n70 24\nSuch a result, in the absence of any link between applicants and\nsitter, strongly supports the argument for telepathic communication\nby the \" deceased \" F. W. Macaulay.\nSecond Part of the Experiment with Mr Macaulay\nJanuary 22, 1937\nAfter I had seen Mrs Lewis's annotations to the foregoing it was\nsuggested by Professor Dodds in a letter dated December 2, 1936,\nthat I should ask the same communicator to say something about\nhis daughter's recent visit to Ireland. He added that this request\nhad reached him \" some time ago \". No further clues about this\nvisit were given me.\nI decided to try. Mentally, while at home, I asked Mr Macaulay\nto attend my next sitting and to speak about his daughter's Irish\nvisit. It was thus some two months after Mrs Lewis' request to\nProfessor Dodds that I made the attempt, and it was fully seventeen\nweeks since the last Macaulay communication, during which interval\nI had taken seven sittings. Yet Mr Macaulay was now introduced\nby Feda without any inquiry or remark by me, save that I gave his\nname when informed that a man was present about whom Feda\nasked whether I wished to give him an opportunity of speaking.\nHere is the verbatim report of that introduction :\nFeda : Now . . . Just wait a minute. ... I don't want to waste\ntime on him if he is not wanted, but were you expecting\na man?\nC. D. T. : I was. I want Mr F. W. Macaulay. We have had him\nhere before and I have asked him to come to-day.\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 271\nWell, he is here, and has he got a daughter on the earth?\nYes.\nThat is the one then, because he says, \" Daughter wants\nmore and friend also. Yes, friend . . . friend ... a man\nwants to know something as weU.\"\n(This last remark possibly referred to the fact that Pro-\nfessor Lewis had suggested my asking for messages from\nhis first wife ; I had not intended to introduce that re-\nquest until the close of this sitting.)\nOf the 30 evidential items given in this sitting 10 referred to the\nIrish visit, and the others to the communicator's interests.\nIf I quote a few of these items it will enable readers to follow the\nallusions made by Mrs Lewis after studying the record.\nFeda : I keep getting the name Ernest, but I don't know whether\nhe is on the earth or passed over. I have had it two or\n5\/91 three times but didn't give it before because I don't know\nwhich side he is on. But I feel something is happening\nabout Ernest that is rather important.\n(My father's very closest friend was called Ernest. They\nwere at the University together and were never long\nwithout seeing one another. Ernest outUved my father.\nHe was still alive during the early sittings.)\nFeda : He wishes to say to his daughter, \" Glad Tidings \". I\ndon't know what he means but it is something happy\n5\/92 relating to what he is helping from the other side to bring\nabout.\n(Shortly after the date of this sitting I received news\nwhich was real \" Glad Tidings \", \u2014namely that my\n^ favourite brother, who had been in Canada for ten years\nand whom we all, my father included, longed to have in\nEngland again, was at last in a position to return home. . . .\nOne reason why my father so wanted my brother home\nwas that he has a son. My father used to say : \"I don't\nwant the Macaulays to become a Canadian family. If\nHugh (the brother) were here, young Dick (tlie son) might\none day '\nretrieve the family fortunes '\nand buy back\nBen Neagh \" (the Irish House).)\nC. D. T. : Your daughter wanted to know if you would like to say\nanything about her recent visit to Ireland.\nFeda : He says. Yes, that has some connection with the glad\ntidings of which he just spoke. He says that he got\nyour message. He doesn't say his daughter's but yours.\np\nFeda :\nC. D. T. :\nFeda :\n\f272 C. Drayton Thomas [PAET\nAs previously remarked I had, two days before this sitting,\nmentally invited Mr Macaulay to be present and give more informa-\ntion. It was the first time I had done so since the previous series\nended four months before. Mrs Lewis was not informed that I\nproposed to resume the attempt at this date, but merely that I would\ntry again. I did not mention to anybody that I proposed to do so\njust now.\nFeda : Wliile his daughter was in Ireland there was an anniver-\n5\/93 sary in which he was interested.\n(Whilst in Ireland my husband and I celebrated the\nanniversary of our engagement. The anniversary of my\nfather's marriage also fell within this period.)\nFeda : She thinks of a name Whit-something or White. . . . Was\n5\/95 that linked with her being in Ireland ^\n(We have relations called White in Belfast.)\nFeda : At a place \" B \", was she interested there in a public\n5\/96-7 building or public institution that he would be interested\nin also? He feels she was.\n(This is interesting. The son of the architect of several\nof the best buildings in Belfast was a great friend of my\nfather. When I was a child these two took me to see these\nbuildings. I, in my turn, showed them to my husband\non this visit, telling him all I could remember of my\nchildhood's experience.)\nFeda : Part of the time she was in town and part in countrified\n5\/97 (o) siirroundings.\n(I was partly in Belfast and partly in the countryside of\nAntrim.)\nFeda : He felt she was in the midst of trams and doing something\n5\/98 that made her think of him.\n(This is another interesting point. I was really nervous\ndriving our car amongst the Belfast tram lines and the\nspeeding trams. Several times I told my husband how\nmy father had hated being driven where there were trams.\nIndeed he would go miles out of his way to avoid them.)\nFeda : A public building and trams, rather a wide space or\n5\/99 square, big and open near it or round it. He gives the\nword \" memorial \".\n(We visited the Belfast Memorial and I thought there of\nmy father.)\nHaving been there myself I can say that the above description\nfits it admirably.\u2014C. D. T.\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 273\nFeda : He thinks his writing need not be wasted, something\n5\/83 might be got out of the writings he left.\nC. D. T. : Who could do that?\nFeda : There is a friend on the earth whom he could impress.\nC. D. T. : Would that be his son-in-law?\nFeda : I think so. He says, \" Not a relation exactly \", but one\nlinked with him on whom he looks as a friend.\n(This might possibly refer to a great mass of meteorolo-\nlogical observations which my father had made over a\ncertain catchment area in Central Wales. He had, as a\nmatter of fact, discussed these with my husband who is,\n\u2022\nas a geographer, also interested in meteorology. My\nhusband says that he could indeed handle this material\n;\nbut that he does not consider himself competent to deal\nwith the hydraulic work.)\nFeda : This man is somewhat psychic and gets impressions on\n5\/84 which he often acts although he has a well balanced mind.\n(This is certainly true of my husband. His \" hunches \",\nas he calls them, were a source of amusement and interest\nto my father.)\nFeda ; He gives the letter \" S \" to do with that person ; it may\nnot be the proper name, but yet quite fitting ; it may\n5\/85 be some special name, but it is one he knows about and\nyou may not.\n(This is ciirious. When I first met my husband I always\ncalled him Stanley and so introduced him to my people.\nOn the eve of my wedding, at the instance of his mother,\nI began to call him Wilfred. My father died before he\nhad become fully accustomed to the name and frequently\nreverted to Stanley. In a sitting which my husband and\nI had with Mrs Brittain in June 1933, 1 made the following\nnote : The Control said, \" The lady's Daddy speaks of\n. the gentleman ; but he says Stanley, Stanley\u2014not\nWilfred, like the lady says.\")\nFeda : Was this Mr Macaulay a researcher of some kind? Not\na psychical researcher but of something else. He always\n5\/87 wanted fuller information. He read much about it and\nwent somewhere where he could study this \" M \" subject.\n(\" M \" is possibly a reference to Meteorology.)\nFeda : Drawings and diagrams had to do with his work. He could\n5\/88 make them himself but had people to do them for him.\n(Correct : diagrams, maps and plans of the region in\nMonmouthshire where he was constructing a reservoir.)\n\f274 C. Drayton Thomas [PART\n[a) He refers to this because he was studying a special\nset of diagrams not long before he passed.\n(He did leave, on a certain table in his study\u2014quite\napart from anything else\u2014a plan upon which he had him-\nself drawn and coloured-in certain sections and made notes.\n)\n(6) He wished to complete it before he passed and a name\n\" G \" was much linl^ed with these studies and work.\n(He was helped in all his work, and greatly helped, by a\nformer governess in the family whom we all call Gibbie.)\n(c) I had, he says, copied with my own hand parts of the\nplan and made notes which I left a little separate from\nmy other work. It was more than plans, the work was\nactually being done, going on, which he wished to com-\nplete when he passed over.\n(As I have already said, he died while this work was being\ndone and was still engaged upon it four days before his\ndeath.)\nHe says \" Institution \", as if he had been linked with a\nspecial institution, but not always the same one.\n(He was closely associated with the Institution of Civil\nEngineers, and with the Institution of Water Engineers,\nbeing on the Council of the former and a President of the\nlatter.)\nWhereas many such societies are called Institutes, the two to\nwhich Mr Macaulay belonged are termed Institutions, and that is\nthe word used by Feda.\nMrs Lewis made comment on this sitting :\n\" In view of the idea that mediums may be telepathicaUy influ-\nenced by the sitter, it is interesting to note that, though Mr Drayton\nThomas, at this sitting, knew quite a number of details about my\nfather, no more definite information is given on points about which\nhe was fairly well informed. Instead, quite new ground is broken\nabout the subject beginning with \" M \", which my husband might\nbe able to handle.\n\" It seems also, in my opinion, that the references to the '\npublic\nbuildings '\nand the '\ntrams '\nin connection with Ireland are striking.\nBoth brought my father very forcibly into my mind.\"\nTen items related to this Irish visit ; of these but two were wrong.\nOne, apparently some slip in transmission, reads that his daughter\nwas not thinking of him while in Ireland ; the other referred to\nsome gathering of people at 11.30 one morning at which he was\nbeing spoken of.\nFeda\n5\/89\nFeda\n5\/106\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 275\nFor the whole sitting there were twenty-five successes and five\nfailures. The detailed valuations being :\nRight\nGood\nFair\nIrish\nReferences\n- 5\n- 0\n- 3\nOther\nReferences\n10\n2\n5\nTotals\n15\n2\n8\nPoor\nDoubtful\nWrong -\n0\n0\n3\n0\n3\n0\n25 successes.\n0\n3\n2\n5 failures.\nNumber of items, 30 ;\nSuccesses, 83-3 per cent.\nTo what shall we attribute this increased percentage of success?\nI had in the meantime seen several letters from the applicants which\nwere forwarded to me by Professor Dodds. Did the sight or hand-\nling of these letters establish a link whereby the appHcant's know-\nledge passed telepathically to me or to the medium? I do not think\nso, but attribute the improvement to practice in the preceding four\nsittings. This may have famiUarised the communicator with tele-\npathic procedure so that he was now better able to transmit his\nprearranged material. I think we may postpone this question for\nawhile, merely noting that, since this fifth sitting attained a higher\ndegree of success than the previous four, it might be expected that\nthe same communicator would do better still if the sittings were\ncontinued. They were continued, but a different communicator was\nasked for. What was the result? We shall presently see that the\nfalling off in evidential quality was immediate and definite, a result\nsuggesting that we now had a different person originating the\nmessages.\nInference from Coincidences with Previous Sittings\nAppended to this account, see Appendix 2, is a list of items which\nwere given some years earher by Mj Macaulay when communicat-\ning with his daughter through other sensitives shortly after his\ndeath.\nIt was only by a happy chance that I noticed these coincidences\nwhen Mrs Lewis kindly allowed me to see records of her earher\ninvestigations in mediumship. It will be observed that no fewer\nthan ten matters which the Macaulay communicator had given three\n\f276 C. Drayton Thomas [part\nyears earlier through other sensitives he now repeated through Mrs\nLeonard when I took proxy sittings on behalf of his daughter at\nthe request of Professor Dodds.\nThis seems fairly conclusive evidence that both sets of messages\noriginated in the same mind. If Mr Macaulay gave them at his\ndaughter's earUer sittings, as she found reason to believe, then it\nwas he who repeated them through Mrs Leonard. (See final note at\nend of Appendix 2.)\nEight of these coinciding references occurred during my first four\nsittings, that is to say, before I had seen Mrs Lewis's handwriting\nor heard of her verifications.\nThat telepathy from Mr Macaulay's daughter or son-in-law played\nno part in the Leonard sittings is further indicated by the fact that,\nafter my seeing their letters to Professor Dodds, the four further\nsittings produced only two more of these previously given items.\nAs before remarked, neither Professor Lewis nor his wife had met\nMrs Leonard.\nConcerning Inaccuracies\nIn the first 4 sittings there were\n\u2014\nWrong 3 ; Doubtful 19 ; out of 94 Items.\nIn the 5th \u201e 2 ; \u201e 3 \u201e 30 \u201e\n5 22 124\nIf one were asked to write 124 statements about a person of whom\nno more was known than I and Mrs Leonard knew of Mr Macaulay,\nit is improbable that the inaccuracies would be limited to five, or\nthe remarks of doubtful applicability so few as twenty-two.\nIt is further highly probable that the quality of the wrong and of\nthe doubtful statements in such fictitious experiment would be\nglaringly worse than that of the Macaulay sittings.\nA brief examination of the failures is appended to this paper (see\nAppendix I). It reveals the fact that errors were mostly trivial, while\na large proportion of the doubtful items were attempts at personal\nnames. In Leonard sittings there is frequent difficulty and partial\nfailure in the transmission of names.\nReviewing these five sittings as a whole we find that the infor-\nmation offered as evidence of personal identity is strikingly applic-\nable to Mr. F. W. Macaulay. This is his daughter's verdict ; and\nit is confirmed, for those of us who did not know him, by the infor-\nmation about his work, his friends, and his personal belongings,\nwhich is provided by his daughter's annotations.\n\f169] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 277\nThe messages have all the appearance of coming from Mr\nMacaulay. Making allowance for occasional blurrings in trans-\nmission, it looks just as if the material had been selected and given\nby him for the purjMse of indicating his identity.\nThose to whom it seems incredible that dead persons survive in\nsome other state of being, or that, if surviving, they can make\ntemporary use of psychic channels to resume intercourse with earth,\n\u2014for such minds there is an urge to suggest alternative explana-\ntions.\nWhat are the most hopeful of such alternatives? Perhaps to\ndoubt the veracity of those taking part in this experiment, or to\nthink that all might be explained by telepathy from Mrs Lewis to\nMrs Leonard.\nWe may profitably address ourselves to a consideration of this\nlatter alternative. Let us examine certain features of the messages\nand note their bearing on the telepathic hypothesis.\nExperiments to Discover if Mrs Lewis could Influence\nTHE Macaulay Communicator\nAfter the second Macaulay sitting Professor Dodds wrote to Mrs\nLewis :\n\" It might be interesting if you tried to convey to your father a\nrequest that he should refer at the next Leonard sitting to some\nspecific topic of your own choice (some interest of your childhood, for\nexample). It might be advisable to write down a short statement of\nthis topic and post it to me.\"\nMrs Lewis chose such a topic and sent a note of it which Professor\nDodds received on August 21, 1937, which was the day of my fourth\nsitting. Neither then nor later was the matter in any way referred\nto at the sittings.\nMrs Lewis made a further attempt on December 13, 1937, when\nasking her father to send me a message which I should feel compelled\nto forward to her. A copy of the request was sent to me in a sealed\nenvelope which I was not to open. It therefore remained unopened\nuntil December 1938, when I noticed it while finally examining all\nmaterial for purposes of this paper.\nThe note reads : \"I have asked my father to try and send me a\nmessage which you will feel compelled to forward to me. I leave\nthe subject matter to him ; but he is to be urgent about it. I have\nalso asked that he shall not mention this sealed envelope to you, but\nshall be so emphatic about the message that you will open it. Eve\nLewis. December 13, 1937.\"\n\f278 C. Drayton Thomas [past\nMy records of sittings contain no message from Mr Macaulay later\nthan his communications of January 22, 1937, about the Irish visit.\nI have never been aware of any urge to open the envelope and had\nforgotten its existence.\nIn neither of these minor experiments do we find any evidence\nthat Mrs Lewis could influence the messages given in Leonard\nsittings or impress my consciousness.\nWas there Telepathy from Mrs Lewis?\nSuch successes as have so far attended experimental telepathy\nshow that ideas caught by the recipient were sometimes those which\nthe person transmitting desired to send ; but at other times the\nreceived ideas had not been in the forefront of the agent's mind\nalthough familiar to him.\nWe cannot be sure that thoughts about her father would pass\ntelepathically from Mrs Lewis more easily while she was thinking of\nmy proxy sittings : nor do we know that, while she was engrossed\nin other matters, her subconscious memories about him could more\neasily reach me or Mrs Leonard. Indeed we know so little of the\nlaws governing the telepathic processes that dogmatism is entirely\nout of place.\nWhat we actually discover in these records is that, while much\nreferred to matters within the daughter's knowledge, the communi-\ncator was able to insert three items based on information which she\ndid not share : I shall refer to these items under the titles of\n\" Gibbie \", \" Disappointment \" and \" Glad Tidings \" (see pp. 283-\n285). Let us first consider the absence of reply to a request for\ninformation about Mr Macaulay's colleagues. The answer to this\nmight have been given in various ways, the simplest being the state-\nment \" both have died \".\nI presume that Mrs Lewis hoped for this and possibly expected\nit ; the answer was certainly in her mind both consciously and sub-\nconsciously. Had she been capable of influencing my sittings tele-\npathically it is exactly here that we might look for evidence of that\nabihty. Inference from silence is unreliable, but, for what it is\nworth, it here tells against telepathy from Mrs Lewis.\nThe following extracts contain everything said, whether by me or\nby the communicator, on this subject.\nProfessor Dodds, when informing me of the applicant's wish for\na message from Mr Macaulay, wrote, \" If a communicator emerges\nwho might be identified as this F. W. Macaulay, the following question\nmight (if opportunity offers) be put to him at the sitting :\n'\nCan you\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 279\ntell me anything of the two men with whom you were so closely\nassociated in your last unfinished piece of work? '\n\"\nSitting 1, paragraph, 4.\nC. D. T. : Your daughter is very anxious to have some evidence of\nyour identity. She asks if you remember, and would care\nto say something about, two men who were connected\nwith you in the last bit of work that you did and which\nyou were not able to finish?\nTo this Feda repUed that he recognised about the daughter and\nabout the two men ; she then passed on to descriptions of the com-\nmunicator's work.\nSitting 2, faragraph 23.\nC. D. T. : Yom- daughter will be so glad to hear from you, and she\nthought if you had any difficulty about proving your\nidentity you could easily do it by giving information about\nthose two men with whom you used to work when you\npassed over and left your work unfinished.\nFeda : He knows what you mean.\nThere immediately followed the description of an instrument\nwhich is recognised as one regularly used by Mr Macaulay in his\noffice. The message then continued :\nFeda : You said two men he was working with, didn't you? Well,\nthere was one who was very much finked up with him\nover this instrument. They were doing some special work\ntogether in which they used this particular instrument.\n(Mrs Lewis writes : He and one of the two men in par-\nticular were often in my father's drawing office.)\nFeda next gave several particulars about this office and added :\nOne of the two men\u2014both the men he worked with seem\nto be on earth still ; because he is talking of one man of\nthe two who seems to be away somewhere. One\u2014but\nwhere is the other one then? I think I have got this\nright. There is a man who is on the earth who worked\nwith him, but he seems to be going away. There is some\nchange round this man.\n(The two men I had in mind when asking the question are\nboth dead. Of his many other coUeagues I cannot speak.)\nSuch a reply camiot be regarded as due to the daughter's tele-\npathic activity.\n\f280 C. Drayton Thomas [part\nSitting 3, paragra'ph 45.\nOn Feda's remarking that the communicator was present I read\naloud a message sent for that purpose by Professor Dodds. It\nincluded the following :\nC. D. T. : It might be useful to say that the two men about whom\nwe asked were Dr L. and Major L. and may I say that\nthe Doctor's Christian name begins with P.\u2014Dr P. L.\nAnd the Major's name begins with two L's. Your daugh-\nter thinks that the lady of whom you spoke is Gibbie.\nShe is very much worried about the Gibbie situation and\ncan you advise her about this?\nIt was probably unwise to put more than one question at a time.\nThe reply dealt with the last one only and did not allude to the two\nmen.\nSitting 4, paragraph 53.\nC. D. T. : His daughter says ... if her father felt inclined she would\nlike to hear a little more about the two men he used to\nwork with, Dr L. and Major L. that she would know . . .\nAnything you like to say to your daughter she will be\nvery pleased to hear, also anything for your friends.\nFeda : Well, he would very much like to do that. Will you please\nleave the suggestions with him and he will deal with them\nas he can in between other things.\nNo further allusion was made to the two men and I reproach\nmyself for omitting to renew the request at the fifth sitting.\nWhatever the originating mind from which came so many in-\ntimate references to Mr Macaulay's professional work, his personal\nmemories and other matters, we can scarcely credit that it was\nwholly ignorant of these colleagues with whom he was working at\nthe time of his death.\nThat this reiterated question was overlooked, or disregarded in\nfavour of other evidential material, seems to me the most probable\nexplanation of the silence. And it does, at least, find some support\nin the obvious difiiculties of the transmission process. We find hints\nof those difiiculties in the following passages :\nSitting 1, paragraph 9.\nC. D. T. : That seems to suggest Free Masonry.\nFeda : Well, don't suggest at all ; he says you might lead him\noff on a wrong track that he doesn't want to go on. Don't -\nsuggest, he says.\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 281\nSitting 3, paragra'ph 52.\nFeda : He is just waiting a minute because there was something\nhe wanted to think about ; so while he is thinking about\nit I will go on to something else.\nAnother communicator was then introduced. Towards the end\nof the sitting Feda reverted to Mr Macaulay.\nFeda : Oh, that gentleman hasn't waited. I thought he was only\njust going to step back a bit, but I suppose he gave all\nhe could.\nC. D. T. : He has not told us about . . . those two gentlemen.\nFeda : No. I left that with him, he is going to think that over.\nHe gave some new things to-day. They can't always\nelucidate things they are wanted to; They can't do\nanything just to order, they have got to prepare it them-\nselves and then get it through.\nSitting 4, faragraph 58.\nThe following paragraph suggests difficulty and is also remarkable\nbecause of the direct voice which occurred no less than sis times.\nBy that I mean that the words printed in italics in the extracts\nthat follow were heard by me and the stenographer in a loud whisper\nwhich was strikingly different from the Feda voice. It sounded on\neach occasion as if produced some twelve or more inches from the\nmedium's Hps. This repetition of direct voice is the more striking\nas there was but one other instance of it in the whole sitting.\nFeda : Ideas. . . . He says his ideas have altered very much\nabout his work since he passed over. He is still interested\nin his work, but he has got such different ideas about it\nthat if he came back he would want to continue. . . .\nWait a moment. . . . He is giving me such a strong look\n\u2014He would want to continue the same work on entirely\ndifferent methods. The methods were wrong ; he says,\nI am going to try and help the people with whom I was\nworking on earth. I will try to tell you some more as\nI go on, but it is difficult to express myself in this way\n\u2014\nin\u2014something terminology\u2014not the right terininology.\nHe says the methods were leading on a wrong line, but\nwe were following them up because they seemed to lead\nsomewhere. But later on, if we persisted, we shall find\nwe have got to retrace our steps.\nSitting 4, paragraph 80.\nFeda : He is showing me like a place where he would go up hUl,\n\f282 C. Drayton Thomas [PAUT\na place he was very, very interested in. (Pause.) I feel\nthat that is it, do you see, because though he shows me a\nlittle quick qicture he didn't show me going anywhere ;\nHe just said it was a place that he was very much interested\nin. Now what are you showing me?\u2014He is stopping.\nI don't know whether he is going away.\nWhat of this failiire to answer the question? I have not found\nthat questions about facts unknown to the person taking a proxy\nsitting are usually unanswered. On the contrary they sometimes\nehcit quite good replies indicating knowledge which the deceased\nwas known to possess. When questions are put by relatives who\nare themselves present at a sitting their deceased friend does not\ninvariably reply. It may be that he prefers to continue with his\nprepared material rather than risk forgetting to give it later ; or\nit may be that his memory has different associations with the subject\nand he replies in words which at first seem inaccurate, but are later\ndiscovered to be a true reply, although not the one expected by the\nquestioner.\nOn the general subject of replies to questions there is a further\npossibility too important to be overlooked. It is that the com-\nmunicator may have forgotten the incident and may even deny\nthat it ever happened. Such blanks in memory certainly occur in\nour present life. I recollect visiting Bideford and being taken by\nmy friend Dr A. T. Shearman to see what was locally termed a\n\" paint mine \". This remained a vivid memory owing to my interest\nin geology. Thirty years later I incidentally asked Dr Shearman\n(whose interests were classical studies and psychology) if he had\nvisited this paint mine since those days. To my astonishment he\ndisclaimed any knowledge of it and I failed to evoke in him any\nrecollection of the occasion. Again, I listened to two ladies who\nhad both known Sandown, I.O.W., in their youth. In comparing\ntheir recollections of the place one recalled a military incident, the\nother a tragedy which had occurred there ; but neither remembered\nthe outstanding event which the other so strongly associated with\nthe place.\nIn my opinion no strong argument can be based on the failure to\nanswer this question about the two colleagues.\nThe Communicator had knowledge of three facts which were\nunknown to Mrs Lewis.\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Siiccess 283\nI. GIBBIE\nSitting 2, paragraph 29. July 24, 1936.\nFeda : I get a feeling of another lady, not his daughter, closely\nrelated to him, I feel it is rather like a sister, and she is\non the earth. He is helping\u2014not her exactly\u2014but he\nis helping about her, something he wants to do in con-\nnection with her, influence her and help her, and he will\ndo it. He would like you to tell his daughter ; he seems\nto thinlv she will know what he means.\n(Mrs Lewis wrote to Professor Dodds, \"This strongly\nsuggests reference to a particular situation that is causing\nme great anxiety at the moment.\")\nSitting 3, paragraph 45. August 21, 1936.\nI have the following message as suggested by Professor\nDodds :\nC. D. T. : Your daughter thinks that the lady of whom you spoke\nis Gibbie. She is very much worried about the Gibbie\nsituation and can you advise her about this ?\nFeda : Yes, yes, it is Gibbie. Gibbie is not making it very easy\nfor anyone to help. It is not just the situation around\nGibbie that is difficult, but Gibbie is not making it easy,\nis not helping others to help. He doesn't want his\n- daughter to try and do an3rthing just at the moment.\nHe has a very strong impression\u2014and here he would like\nto be careful and say he has the impression that in about\na fortnight from now there will be an easing of the situa-\ntion, an opportunity for his daughter to see if something\ncan be done, but not to move till then. There are some\ndifficult conditions round Gibbie, not her own entirely,\nbut somebody's difficult condition, something that has to\nbe fought down.\n(Since the sitting was held I have heard news which\nmakes it seem that the difficult situation, which has\nexisted unchanged for nearly two years, may be eased\nwithin the next week or two. The phrase \" something\nthat has to be fought down \" is most appropriate.)\n(In a later letter of October 6, 1936, ]\\Irs Lewis added\n\u2014\n\" You may remember that I asked whether I could do\nanything about the Gibbie situation and was told to\nleave things alone as there were signs that it was going\n.\nJ to improve by itself 'wathin the next few weeks. Frankly\n\f284 C. Drayton Thomas [part\nI did not think this possible, but actually the miracle has\ncome to pass.)\nFixU details were given in substantiation. Having read them I\ncan vouch for the relevancy of the allusions and the inside knowledge\nof family matters they imply. The name Gibbie was purposely\ngiven by Mrs Lewis in order that I might introduce it at the sitting ;\nthere remains therefore no uncertainty as to the person referred to\nin the subsequent messages.\nWe thus have the significant fact that, at the third sitting, the\ncommunicator expressed the opinion that a certain situation would\nshortly change for the better. This was regarded as impossible by\nMrs Lewis, but seven weeks after the forecast was made she wrote\nof it that \" the miracle has come to pass \". We may therefore\nconclude that the communicator knew something which his daughter\ndid not know ; his forecast being based on information to which\nMrs Lewis had no access at the time it was given. It neatly evades\nthe telepathic hypothesis ; for to suggest that Mrs Lewis subcon-\nsciously knew the facts and drew the inference would be to credit\nher with imaginary powers for which there is no warrant in anything\nknown about telepathy, whether spontaneous or experimental.\nn. Disappointment and Uncektainty which will end\nSatisfactorily\nSitting 2, paragraph 43. J^dy 24, 1936.\nFeda : Her father says that his daughter has been rather dis-\nappointed about something not coming to a head for her\nhusband. There is something being kept back or delayed\nfor him and about him, as if they are being kept in the\ndark a little, so that she wonders what is going to happen.\nIt is rather an important thing for them and he thinks it\nwill be all right. It is only a delay and it will work itself\nout.\n(Mrs Lewis wrote on November 3, 1937\u2014This is so per-\nsonal that I really cannot expand it, except to say that it\nexactly described my feelings at the time of the sitting.\nNow the situation has, within the last six weeks, abso-\nlutely \" worked itself out \".)\nThe communicator's statement indicates that he had knowledge\nof contemporary events or mental processes of which his daughter\nknew nothing.\nDisappointment and uncertainty are so frequent in the life of most\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 285\npeople that such references are worthless as evidence unless accom-\npanied by definite statements. In the above instance these were\nincluded, viz. (1) For her husband, (2) something kept back or\ndelayed, (3) about which they are kept in the dark, (4) and wonder-\ning, (5) it will be all right, it is only a delay.\nThe matter being private we cannot judge for ourselves exactly\nhow pertinent to the facts this forecast may have been. But Mrs\nLewis has recorded her opinion quite clearly.\nIII. Glad Tidings\nSitting 5, paragraph 92. January 22, 1937.\nFeda : I don't know what \" glad tidings \" means, but he is\nbringing in these words. Something for you to say to\nhis daughter, \" glad tidings \". He wants it put that way\nand it seems to lift me up a little. It is pleasant and\nhappy and will affect the conditions that ]\\Ir Macaulay is\nhelping to bring about from the other side. He wants\nher to know that he is trying to help.\nC. D. T. : Your daughter wished to know if you would lilfe to say\nanything about her recent visit to Ireland.\nFeda : Yes, yes, isn't it funny? He is a bit linking that up with\nwhat he has just been saying.\nC. D. T. : I don't know anything about it.\nFeda : He is glad that you don't know. But now that you have\nbrought up the subject he says, \" That has some con-\nnection with what I have been telhng you and which\nI entitled '\nglad tidings '.\"\nMrs Lewis wrote\n\u2014\" shortly after the date of this sitting I received\nnews which was real \"glad tidings \"\n;\nnamely that my favourite\nbrother, who has been in Canada for ten years, was at last in a\nposition to return. He actually took the decision on Christmas Day\n1936 and came back in March 1937. I heard of it in February\n1937.\n\" One reason why my father so wanted my brother home was that\nhe had a son. My father used to say, '\nI don't want the Macaulays\nto become a Canadian family. If Hugh (the brother) were here,\nyoung Dick (the son) might one day retrieve the family fortune and\nbuy back Ben Neagh '\n(the Irish house).\"\nHere we see a further instance in which the commimicator had\nobtained information which was unknown to his daughter. There\nwas, as he distinctly stated, a connection between \" glad tidings\n\"\n\f286 C. Drayton Thomas 'J -.\n\" [part\nand Ireland. Tidings shortly arrived which held possibility of the\nfulfilment of his remembered hope that the grandson might some\nday buy back their ancestral home in Ireland.\nThus the message was presently understood and, as I think,\ncorrectly, notwithstanding that certain phrases, such as \" some\nconnection with \", \"a bit of Unking up with \", \" will affect the\nconditions \" were vague. In general the use of terms like these is\nexasperating, because they merely hint at a possible meaning\nundefined. In such cases the communicator's thought may have\nbeen clear, but the Control's transmission of it infelicitous. If a\nsitter finds it exasperatingly vague, how much more must the com-\nmunicator, that is if he realises the form in which his thoughts are\nbeing translated. He may well feel as one who, wishing to express\nhimself in a foreign tongue, is compelled by limited vocabulary to\ncircumlocutions which but partially and imperfectly represent what\nhe desires to say.\nIn the above three instances we find that the communicator was\naware of matters which were quite unknown to his daughter. Thi^\ntells against the hypothesis that these communications are attri-\nbutable to telepathic activity on the part of Mrs Lewis. Her own\nopinion is seen in the following letter :\n\" I do not think that I am mentally specially accessible. I have\nsat with two mediums, both supposed to be excellent, who gave me\nnothing. I was alone with them on every occasion. When I have\nhad good results my husband has been present ; so the inference\nwould be that the telepathy, if any, was with him. As an argument\nagainst the telepathic theory I may remark that, in those good\nsittings, most of the material given was quite outside my husband's\nknowledge.\"\nThese three forecasts are proved, by their fulfilment, to have been\nbased on information about thoughts or purposes, which were at\nthe time in some mind or minds of people other than Mrs Lewis.\nThis ability to notice active thought in the mind of some person or\npersons which will ultimately affect the sitter, although entirely\noutside his present awareness, has been shown from time to time\nby my chief communicators. The results warranted the forecasts\nbased on that asserted knowledge. Are we to reject this claim of\nthe communicators? If so, what is the alternative explanation?\nIt would be that the medium possessed the abihty which, in the\nsittings, is attributed to the communicators. On considering the\nimplications of this hypothesis we find that it assumes the possession\nby the medium of a faculty which lies beyond anything attributable\nto brain and mind. Such transcended faculty suggests the operation\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 287\nof something which loss of the physical body would leave unim-\npaired, an activity of the soul acting independently of the body. If\nthat can be achieved during earth life it is little surprising to find\nit being done posthumously.\nI have deemed it necessary to deal at some length with this ques-\ntion of telepathy because of the tendency in some minds to suppose\nthat, even in successful proxy sittings, it is preferable to refer the\ngiven information to some distant mind on earth rather than to\nthe ostensible discarnate speaker.\nThird Pakt of the Experiment\nThe First Mrs Lewis\nIn the letter from Professor Dodds, dated December 2, 1936,\nwhich suggested inquiry about an Irish visit, it was also asked if\nI would try to obtain messages from the first wife of Professor\nLewis. The letter ran thus :\n\" Professor Lewis would like to try, if there is ever an opportunity,\nwhether a communication can be obtained through Mrs Leonard\nfrom his first wife. This might prove, I think, of some evidential\nvalue, as the present Mrs Lewis knows (I am told) exceedingly little\nabout her predecessor, and telepathy between Mrs Lewis (herself\npsychic) and Mrs Leonard would thus virtually be ruled out, in a\nway in which it is not ruled out in the Lewis-Leonard experiments\nup to date.\"\nOn seeing a copy of the above, Professor Lewis wrote me that his\npresent wife knew \" practically nothing of her predecessor and had\nnever consciously seen her \".\nIn the course of the fifth sitting on January 22, 1937, Feda had\nsaid, \" He is very anxious for me to describe someone he has with\nhim.\" She then gave ten details of face, form and dress. Com-\nmenting on this Professor Lewis later wrote, \" This is a very fair\ndescription of my first wife as regards stature, shape of face, colour-\ning and style of hairdressing.\" Having at that time no suspicion\nthat this referred to the first Mrs Lewis, and with the above request\nin mind, I presently took opportunity to ask if Mr Macaulay would\nbring the first Mrs Lewis. He agreed to do so.\nOther interests occupied me during the next four sittings and it\nwas not until just before my sitting of March 5, 1937, that I mentally\nasked the first Mrs Lewis to be present and give messages for her\nhusband. Three months had elapsed since she had been mentioned\nin Mrs Leonard's presence, yet she was now introduced as follows :\nQ\n\f288 C. Drayton Thomas [part\nFeda : Oh, what does she want? - '\n\u2022\nC. D. T. : Have they brought a lady? '\nFedA : Yes, I think this is a case.\nC. D. T. : I have asked for the first wife of Professor Lewis. Does\nthis lady know him?\nFeda : I think this is the one.\nFrom the items given by this communicator the following were\nthe best. (The annotations are given by Professor Lewis.)\nDate of sitting : March 5, 1937.\nFeda : Something important happened about twenty years ago,\n6\/111 a link with them both, it caused them to be together.\n(We were married in 1918.)\nI ascertained later that the marriage was in June 1918 ; a date\nonly fifteen months short of twenty years before this sitting.\u2014\nC. D. T.\nFeda : The name Piatt is a link with the old days, not important\n6\/13G but connected with a time when she was on earth.\n(A Mr Piatt, known to her, was in College with me in\n1910-13.)\nFeda : She mentions this because her husband has quite recently\n6\/137 been reading something in which the name Piatt figures\nvery prominently, but no connection with the Piatt of\nlong ago.\n(Another Piatt, not known to her, but known to me and a\nlater student at the same college, which she knew well, has\nwritten a book on geological maps. I have been recently\npreparing lectures involving reference to that book.)\nDate of sitting : April 2, 1937.\nFeda : She has very happy memories in connection with him\n(i.e. Professor Lewis) and a place \" S \", quite away from\n7\/141 his present locality. A place sounding like Soam . . .\nSum ... I get an \" M \" sound in it. I had better not\ntry to get more than the \" S \".\n(We became engaged at a small village called Swindon\noutside Cheltenham.)\nDate of sitting : June 18. 1937.\nFeda : I am going back to a bridge, a good many years ago, in\n8\/147 the evening, in April, the name WiUiam comes much in\nmemory, a special time and circumstances that were\nimportant.\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 2S9\n(I proposed to my first wife on a l^ridge, on an April\nevening, twenty-five years ago. There were certain\ndifficulties connected with her father which delayed her\nacceptance, and the father's name was William.)\nIt wiU be noted that the above refers to fi.ve facts all of which\nwere closely connected with a single occasion, and all are recognised\nas correct.\nNotwithstanding the successes quoted above, the whole result\nwas poor.\nAjs'alysis of Results\nby Mrs Lewis in three sittings :\n14 Poor - - 0 Number of Items 47\n4 Doubtful - 19\n6 Wrong - 4 Successes, 51 per cent.\n24 23\nIt is evident at a glance that this communicator was much less\nsuccessful than the former. The impression conveyed by the full\nrecords is even more unfavourable to the second communicator than\nthese figures show. Comparing them for quality of successes, and\nmaking deductions for each failure, the superiority of Macaulay\nover Lewis is in the proportion of 6 to 1.\nIn order to make this comparison I take the same number of\nitems, viz., the first 47 of each, and calculate the percentage.\nMacaulay's first 47 obtained 74-4 per cent, successes.\nMrs Lewis's first 47 obtained 51 per cent, successes.\nBut this does not reveal the wide difl^erence in quality of the two\nresults. To obtain this I devised the following method :\nFor each \"'\nRight \" add 2 ; for each Good \" add one.\nFor each Wrong \" subtract 2 : for each \" Doubtful \" subtract\none.\nThus\u2014Macaulay\u2014Right - 18\nGood - 5\nFair - 12\nPoor - 1\nDoubtful 9\nWrong - 2\nItems given\nRight\nGood\nFair\n18 and 36 are 54\n5 and 5 are 10 -Total - 76\n12]\n9 and 9 are 18 j\nTotal - 25\n2 and 4 are %j \u2014\n51\n\f290 C. Drayton Thomas [part\nLewis\u2014 Right - 14 14 and 28 are 42 ~j\nGood - 4 4 and 4 are 8 ITotal - 56\nTreating tlie records by this method the 47 items yield figures\nwhich seem to express more accurately the difference in quaUty of\nthe two sets. Mrs Lewis with 6 is seen to be not quite one-ninth so\nsuccessful as Mr Macaulay.\nHow are we to account for this disparity? Conditions should\nhave favoured the second communicator ; for by the time her three\nsittings commenced a considerable correspondence had passed\niDetween me and the applicants.\nI think we may assume that the evidence points to two distinct\n\u2022communicators. Had these purported communicators been fictions\nof the medium's subconscious, and had the information been ob-\ntained by her own excursive or telepathic faculties, there should\nhave been no falhng off in the result. But the fall was sudden and\ndecisive.\nIn comparing my numerous records of what different communi-\ncators have given through Feda it is seen that some are more concise\nthan others. The record of Mr Macaulay's first 47 evidential items\noccupies 207 lines, while that of Mrs Lewis's 47 occupies 278 lines ;\nthe average for each item being 4-4 and 5-9 lines respectively.\nThis again favours the assumption that different minds originated\nthe two sets of messages, the same stenographer having made and\ntyped these verbatim records.\nFinal Remarks on the Whole Series op Sittings\nIt may be objected that the facts given by the Macaulay com-\nmunicator as evidence of his identity were known to his daughter\nand therefore open to the suspicion that they were obtained by the\nmedium from her memory. To this there are three answers :\n1. The communicator would naturally wish to select from his\nmemories such facts as his daughter could verify ; for the giving of\nunverifiable evidence would be pointless.\n2. The Gibbie forecast revealed knowledge of fact which was\nunknown to his daughter. Two other forecasts did likewise, al-\nthough these are perhaps less convincing than the former.\n3. No fewer than 22 statements are marked doubtful because\nFair - 6\nPoor - 0\nDoubtful 19 19 and 19 are 38 ITotal - 50\n4 and 8 are Vl] \u2014\nWrong - 4\n6\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 291\nMrs Lewis had no means of ascertaining whether or not they were\ntrue. Some of these may have represented information not shared\nhj her.\nThe final refuge of the sceptic is the hypothesis that no statement\nneed be attributed to discarnate intelligence if it refers to anything\nknown at the time by anyone anywhere on earth.\nAs to this, let those believe it who can!\nThe first four Macaulay communications were on a high grade of\nevidential value. No relative of the deceased approached me ; the\nexperiment was arranged by an intermediary who was careful to\ngive only the necessary clues.\nThe proportion of accurate statements puts the result outside the\nscope of chance coincidence. The nature of the statements is also\nsignificant ; for they chiefly related to memories held in common\nby the deceased and the applicants. Not only were these suitably\nselected, but three of them indicated an awareness of facts which\nthe daughter did not know till later. Telepathy from her is thereby\ndiscredited. Is there any logical alternative to acknowledging that\nher father was the communicator ?\nPrevious proxy cases have shown similar instances where a com-\nmunicator revealed knowledge vrhich was unknown to the applicant.\nOne such was \" the pipes \" incident recorded in the Bobbv Newlove\ncase. (Proc. SP.R., Vol. XLIII, 1935, pp. 481-483.)\nAs is well known sitters often receive information unknown to\nthem at the time : proxy sittings prove that the same happens when\na person taking the sitting is unacquainted with either the com-\nmunicator or his relatives. We may therefore conclude that, should\na communicator know something which his relatives do not know,\nthe absence of the latter does not aftord his ability to transmit that\ninformation through a medium.\nThe hypothesis that in these cases the information is derived\ntelepathically from some distant person should not be easily assumed\n;\nespecially when, as is usually the case, the distant person who knew\nthe fact in question has never heard of either sitter or medium.\nWhat, one may ask, is the supposed prompting which could start\nthis telepathic action? W^hose mind is it which makes so judicious\na selection of the appropriate time and message contents?\nIf the knowledge emerging in these proxy sittings is attributable\nto a purely human faculty, then that faculty differs from the tele-\npathy which manifests in spontaneous and experimental cases. If\nhuman, it is sui generis ; but I know of no adequate reason for\nsupposing it to be a human faculty. The evidence points in another\ndirection.\n\f292 C. Drayton Thomas [part\nIn the third experiment messages from the first Mrs Lewis were\nless successful, despite the fact that she had given good evidence to\nher husband at earlier sittings with other mediums.\nBefore the date of this third experiment I had learnt a little about\nthe present Mrs Lewis and her father ; for I had seen her annotations\nto the Macaulay communications. Lnaginative critics have sug-\ngested that if I see an applicant's handwriting I have thereby estab-\nlished a link which facilitates the transmission of ideas from him\nto me or to the medium. The result of the third experiment\ndoes not bear out this suggestion ; for the success was strikingly\nless.\nIt seems significant that Mr Macaulay should have produced a\nmuch higher proportion of success than did the first Mrs Lewis.\nWhy should this have been? The conditions were the same, except-\ning that a different communicator had been asked for and the\nmaterial given had to be annotated by Professor Lewis and not by\nhis wife. It may be granted that amiotators differ in their estimate\nof what constitutes evidence. Let us assume that Professor Lewis\nwas more exacting than Mrs Lewis ; would this account for the\nstriking difference in our numerical findings for the two communi-\ncators? I greatly doubt it.\nThat communicators in proxy sittings reveal a wide difference in\nability to select and transmit appropriate evidence I had previously\nnoticed while examining some fifty proxy cases. The same wide\ndifference was a conspicuous feature in Book Tests.\nGranted a good medium and a sympathetically understanding\nsitter the result would seem to depend entirely upon the ability and\nperseverance of the communicator.\nFrom Mrs Lewis I learn that her father had proved himself an\nexcellent communicator in sittings which she took shortly after his\ndeath. He then gave accurate and detailed evidence of identity\nwith but a small percentage of error. This is confirmed by Professor\nDodds who has examined those records. Moreover, Mr. Macaulay\nwas \" endlessly patient with children and immature minds \", and\nthis is an important point ; for, if the process of communication be\nas difficult as Controls and communicators assert, much patience\nand persistent effort are essential for the best results.\nProfessor Lewis tells me that his first wife was \" most painstaking\nand precise \", also \" able to combine precis and clarity \". He thinks,\nhowever, that she might be disinclined to help a control who did\nnot easily grasp her meaning, since it was not her habit to \" suffer\nfools gladly \". Now it is often noticed that communicators reveal\ntraits of their earth-life character : hence it may be that Mrs Lewis,\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 293\neven if noticing that much of her material was being distorted, would\nnot trouble to elaborate messages incorrectly transmitted, but hoped\nthat some at least might get through. So does an inexpert golfer\ncontinue driving his balls into the water-hazard trusting that pre-\nsently one win reach the other side.\nHere is an instance of such refusal \"to be bothered explaining\nIt relates to a regular communicator who gave first class evidence\nof identity at many sittings. I rarely failed to recognise her state-\nments, although a few of them were obscured in transmission and\nonly explained at later dates. On this occasion she gave through\nFeda thus\n:\nFedA : Ash\u2014Ash, a name.\nC. D. T. : Was it one of the maids?\nFeda : No, not in the house or the family, but one very much\nconnected with the house.\nC. D. T. : Sorry, but I do not trace that.\nFeda : Leave it. She is not one who would care to be bothered\nexplaining.\nMonths later it occurred to me that the name, given by Feda as\nAsh, was intended for Nash. This explanation was accepted at a\nsubsequent sitting and followed by considerable information about\nthis Mrs Nash, some of which I knew to be correct, and some of\nwhich I was able to verify afterwards.\nHere then was an instance of a name being wrongly given and\nthe communicator either unable, or not troubling, to correct the\nmistake.\nj\\Irs Lewis. lHvC the above, mav have been unwilling \" to be\nbothered explaining \" these messages which failed to get through\ncorrectly at a first attempt.\nA further point of interest is that Professor Lewis, for some time\nafter his wife's death, had excellent sittings, but as time passed the\nquaUty of her communications diminished. Li my twenty-two years\nof investigation I have noticed with some communicators a similar\ndecline ;\nthey did best in the first year or so, then their interest in\nproviding evidence seemed to slacken. It may be that they became\nengrossed in activities of the new life and no longer felt strong\ninterest in earthly contacts. This diminution of interest is by no\nmeans universal ; some of my very best communicators left earth\nmore than twenty years ago. Much would seem to depend on\nstrength of aifection or the conviction that mediumistic intercourse\nwith us can be of benefit.\nI was happy to accede to the suggestion by Professor Dodds that\n\f294 C. Drayton Thomas [part\nthis experiment should be undertaken : for he and I represent two\ndivergent opinions held by members of the S.P.R. These are (1) the\nultra cautious, which relies on the hypothetically unlimited scope\nof telepathy between persons widely separated and even unknown\nto each other. And (2) the whole-hearted conviction of the actuality\nof intercourse with those departed this life.\nWe agree on the possibility of telepathy between minds on earth.\nOur differences would seem to hinge on the dubious extension of\nsuch telepathy ; is it practically unlimited, so that it can be assumed\nas a vera causa for everything met with in mediumistic communi-\ncations ? Or do the latter sometimes go beyond anything explicable\nby telepathy?\nI am confident that they do. This conviction is based on oft\nrepeated and varied observations. Of these the proxy sittings form\na part. One such case was reported in the S.P.R. Proceedings,\nVol. XLIII, 1935, entitled \" A Proxy Case extending over eleven\nsittings \". The present case is a degree further removed from\nexplanation by telepathy because of results obtained under condi-\ntions entirely excluding contact between sitter and applicants.\nNote by Professor E. R. Dodds\nMr Drayton Thomas has asked me to state my personal view\nof the Macaulay-Lewis experiment, as I was instrumental in\narranging it and have examined the whole of the material fairly\nclosely.\nIt appears to me that the hypotheses of fraud, rational inference\nfrom disclosed facts, telepathy from the actual sitter, and coincidence\ncannot either singly or in combination account for the results\nobtained. Only the barest information was supplied to sitter and\nmedium, and that through an indirect channel. Until after the\nfirst sitting (at which a substantial amount of veridical matter\nemerged) the medium had no opportunity of initiating enquiries;\nand although she might then conceivably have had recourse to\no))ituary notices and to a private enquiry agency, I cannot imagine\nhow she could have obtained such items as \" Reece-Riss \"\n(47),\n\" Puggy \"\n(79) or the reference to Professor Lewis's private con-\nversation on a bridge 25 years earlier (147). It is equally incredible\nto me that such items were all of them mere lucky shots.\nIf these hypotheses are ruled out, the experiment seems to present\nus (and this is its importance) with a clear-cut \" either-or \" : Mrs\nLeonard had supernormal access on this occasion either (a) to some\nof the thoughts of a living person or persons who had never held any\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success . 295\ncommunication with her or ivith the sitter : or else (b) to some of the\nthoughts of a mind or minds other than that of a Uving person.^\nI see at present no plausible means of escape from this staggering\ndilemma. Nor do I see any vaUd ground for embracing one horn\nof it and spurning the other, as Mr Thomas does. In the present\nstate of our knowledge\u2014or rather ignorance\u2014about the mechanism\nof telepathy, it seems to me impossible to specify the limits of its\noperation, though no doubt such limits exist and will one day be\ndetermined. In the meantime I can only state my conclusion in\nthe form of a disjunctive proposition.\nThree remarks, however, seem worth making, in answer to\ncertain arguments of Mr Thomas's :\n(ff) All the veridical statements about the past or the present\nattributed by Feda to \" F. W. Macaulay \" concerned matters\nwithin the knowledge of the present Mrs Lewis : all those attributed\nto \" the first Mrs Lewis \" concerned matters within the knowledge\nof Professor Lewis. (Three statements about the future, attributed\nto \" F. W. Macaulay \", Nos. 43, 45, 92, are claimed by Mr Thomas\nas veridical (see above, pp. 283 ff.) ; but they are unfortunately so\nvague that with a little goodwill I could read all three of them as\nreferring to recent incidents in my own life. Such optimistic\nbal^blings are a stand-by with all mediums : to build any argument\non them seems to me more than rash.)\n(b) Between the \" Macaulay \" and the \" Lewis \" sittings there\nwere thus two changes : a change of \" communicator \", and also a\nchange in the person who was able to verify the communications\nand must on the telepathic hypothesis be regarded as their ultimate\nsource. On this hypothesis the qualitative inferiority of the \" Lewis\n\"\ncommimications might simply mean that Professor Lewis proved a\nless effective telepathic agent than his wife (as I should in fact\nexpect from my knowledge of them).\n(c) I cannot agree with Mr Thomas that there is nothing in the\nwhole experiment to support the suggestion that the Macaulay\ncommunications owed anything to telepathy from minds on earth\nApart from the negative fact that \" F. W. Macaulay \" made no\nverifiable reference to matters outside his daughter's knowledge,\nthere is his positive awareness of his daughter's recent movements\n(96-99) and even (it would seem) of her recent thoughts (43, 98).\n' I put the second alternative in this negative way because I have no means\nof deJimng the character or status of such minds, if they exist, or of deter-\nmining how many such minds might, smgly or between them, possess the\nveridical information which was given. Even the use of the word \" mind \"\nperhaps assumes more than is strictly justified.\n\f296 C. Drayton Thomas [part\n\" F. W. Macaulay \" stated that lie was \" with her \" (whatever that\nmeans) on the day described in items 98-9, and I am in no position\nto dispute the assertion ; hut in such a case the telepathic hypo-\nthesis has at least the relative merit of postulating one miracle\ninstead of two.\nIt is, I think, worth adding that I made an earlier attempt, on\nbehalf of a different enquirer, to obtain messages through Mrs\nLeonard without any commimication either between the enquirer\nand Mrs Leonard or between the enquirer and the actual sitter (in\nthis case Miss Nea Walker). In 1934 Miss Walker kindly consented\nat my request to take a sitting on behalf of an unnamed friend of\nmine who Avished to receive a message from an unnamed near\nrelative who had been an active member of the S.P.R. and had\nbelieved in survival. No other information was supplied to her.\nThe resultant sitting (date of which was not known in advance\neither to me or to the enquirer) yielded a few relevant statements,\nbut nothing which either in the enquirer's judgment or in mine\nexceeded the normal range of coincidence. The failure may be\nvariously explained : without further experiment it would be rash\nto conclude that it is an indispensable condition of success in proxy\nsittings for the actual sitter to know the names of the enquirer and\nthe desired communicator. I should like to see other experiments\ntried on these lines.\nMay I urge, in conclusion, that serious students of psychical\nresearch should acquaint themselves with the complete annotated\nrecord of the Macaulay and Lewis sittings, which may be seen at\nthe Society's Rooms?\nAPPENDIX I\nCharacteristics of the Messages Marked \" Doubtful \"\nMore than half of these were attempts at personal names ; those\naccustomed to sit with Mrs Leonard will agree that Feda finds\nnames difficult and that they are frequently given in distorted form.\nTo listen while she struggles for the correct name is exactly like\nhearing a rather deaf person try to repeat some difficult word which\nis but lialf heard.\nThe following examples will suffice to indicate the character of\nthese \" doubtful \" name messages.\nFeda : Foreman . . . Foreman. No, that is not right. A name\nsounding For-something, like Foreman. It is awful like\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Significant Success 297\n4\/30 Foreman. For- For, just leave it for the moment. I am\nafraid to stop too long.\n(Foreman not identified.)\nFeda : Would there be a name Abby, Abby ? (This was not\n1\/14 proceeded with and is not identified.)\nFeda : He is trying to get another name now beginning with a\n1\/17 ' G \". I feel this is a lady's name, there is a feminine\nfeeling. Somebody he was very interested in.\n(This cannot be traced.)\nFeda : Willow, Willow, Willow. It must be the name of a place.\nIt is something he has been thinking about lately. His\n2\/28 daughter ? Has he a sister do you know? I get a feeUng\nof another lady, and it is not his daughter, closely related\nto him. I feel it is rather like a sister and she is on the earth.\n(I wish Feda could be pressed about \" WiUow \". Taken\nin conjunction with the next paragraph it suggests an\nattempt at a place name which, if correctly given. I should\nconsider to be e\\'idential. The place name is Ludlow.)\nFeda : (After giving a description which Professor Lewis recog-\nnised as a very fair description of my first wife as regards\n5\/90 stature, shape of face, colouring and style of hairdressing.)\nA name comes to her Ellen, Nellie ; she may be speaking\nof a relative.\n(Professor Lewis continued : \"I know of no Ellen or\nNellie likely to be closely associated with her. A grand-\nmother of mine, now passed over some years, knew her\nand was fond of her, but their contacts were so few and\nshort, a total of hours in all at long intervals, that this\nseems unrehable as e\\ddence, even though the grand-\nmother's name was Ellen.'')\nOther of these \" doubtful \" items were as foUows :\nFeda : Batten, Button. Just put it down. Not long before he\npassed over he had been wanting to loosen something,\n2\/40 he calls it a batten ;\nsomething he wanted to do and he\nremembers speaking about this batten, something to do\nwith his work. He wanted it done specially. And hooks\nto put things on, hooks, hooks, hanging things on hooks.\nNot ordinary clothes places, but as if he got things and\nhung them up in places.\n(I have heard this word in general engineering talk, but\ncannot recoUect any particular occasion.)\n3\/47 In the midst of a reference to happy times in the past,\n\f298 C.

Francis\nis certainly dead, I do not know about John and Harry.\nIn view of this uncertainty both John and Harry are\ncounted among the \" doubtful \" references.)\nOh, does he hold something to his eye? Not an ordinary\nglass, but something he holds up right close to his eye\nlike looking down a peep-hole. This is like a sort of little\ntunnel that he puts to his eye.\n(He frequently used a magnifying glass, but I do not\nrecollect any \" sort of little tunnel \". It may be a con-\nfusion with his telescope. This he used a great deal on\nthe rifle range. In a sitting with another medium I was\ntold that a telescope was very significant in comiection\nwith him.)\nHe went up a hill somewhere, a place he was interested\nin. He just showed me a little quick picture and said it\nwas a place he was very interested in.\n(Too vague, though I can add that all my father's reser-\nvoirs, excepting one covered storage tank, were made by\ndamming valleys in hilly country.)\nI get shipping too. I don't feel he had much to do with\nthat, but he is giving me the place.\n(He was always interested in shipping, as his father was\na naval man.)\nitems only seem to be definitely inaccurate. They are as\nA Description of the office in which he worked contained\nnine points ; of these all were correct save the two here\ngiven.\nHe gives me the idea of a smell that I should not like,\nthat would make me cough, dangerous to stay in it too\nlong, as if it would make one unconscious. It is in this\nroom near the wall, about 3 feet up. Both the men he\nworked with seem to be on earth still.\n(The \" smell \" is completely wrong. The two men I had\nin mind when asking the question are both dead. Of his\nmany other colleagues I cannot speak.)\nDate of sitting, July 24, 1936.\nShe was thinking very much of him last week, something\nhad been happening last week that reminded her of him\n\f159] A Proxy Experiment of Signifimnt Success 299\n3\/34 in his early life.

There seems to be\nanother kind of anniversary, a rather important kind, in\nAugust.\n(I cannot recall any particular anniversaries in July or\nAugust, excepting that I always thinlv of him during the\nBisley Meetings, because he so enjoyed them ; and again\nthink of watching cricket matches with him when I was-\non holiday during those two months. But then most\nthings remind me of him.)\nFeda : An elderly woman with him who belongs to his daughter's\nhusband. Did you say her name was Emma? There is\n2\/44 an Emma with him. I get Mary again now quickly, as\nif there must have been a link between them.\n(If Emma is the woman connected with my husband we\ndon't know her. But my aunt of that name, who was a\nSpiritualist, died recently. I don't know a Mary in con-\nnection with her.)\n4\/61 An instrument is described as one used by Mr Macaulay\nin his work. This is recognised by his daughter, except\nfor the following point\n:\nFeda : He seems to put on it glasses and bits of metal. Some-\nthing with glasses he used.\n(Glass played no part in the process. He frequently used\na magnifying glass.)\nFeda : It was rather an interesting time when she was in Ireland,\n5\/94 not that she was thinking of him while there.\n(I was thinking constantly of him as we were visiting a\nvillage where the Macaulays had lived for three hundred\nyears.)\nIt is obvious that the remark \" not that she was thinking of him\nwhile there \" was an error, either in transmission or by the steno-\ngrapher ; for in 5\/98 Feda said, \" He felt she was in the midst of\ntrams and doing something that made her think of him.\"\nFeda : Half-past eleven in the morning I was with her, a special\ntime ; she will know why.

There are two possible explanations, although one of them fails\nto explain the whole and is, in my opinion, wholly imaginary. It\nassumes that the above coincidences were due to the memory of\nMrs Lewis from which, three years after the Brittain sittings, some\nof the recollections given there were now \" read \" by Mrs Leonard.\nThat hypothesis is weakened by the fact that special precautions\nwere taken to ensure that neither sitter nor medium should have\nany mental link with Mrs Lewis. We had nothing beyond the clue\nnecessary for indicating the person from whom communication was\nsought ; that clue being in the handwriting of Professor Dodds and\nnot in that of Mrs Lewis. The above hypothesis is further dis-\ncredited by its failure to explain the inclusion of messages which\nrevealed awareness of facts which were unknown to Mrs Lewis.\n\f306 C. Drayton Thomas [part 159]\nTo me the coincidences between Brittain and Leonard sittings\nindicate that the Macaulay communicator from whom I received\nso much accurate information was not a fiction created by Mrs\nLeonard's mind, but an independent person who, after the lapse of\nthree years, offered as proof of identity some of the same material\nwhich he had previously selected for the same purpose and given\nthrough other sensitives and to a different sitter.\nWhile going to Press the suggestion was brought to my notice that\ninformation about Mr F. W. Macaulay could presumably have been\nfound in published notices. I accordingly inspected Who's Who^\nfor a year previous to Mr Macaulay's decease but found no mention\nof his name. I next wrote to the Editors of all the Birmingham\ndaily and weekly papers inquiring about obituary notices, and on\nlearning that two had appeared I procured copies.\nThe Birmingham Mail for May 22, 1933, gives the following\nparticulars among much else which has no bearing on Leonard\nsittings : Mr F. W. Macaulay died on May 20, 1933, after an opera-\ntion. He was in his 69th year and had been Chief Engineer to the\ncity Water Department and a recognised authority on water\nengineering. A member of the Institute of Civil Engineers he entered\nthe city's employment on the recommendation of the late James\nMansergh. The date of his retirement was 1929.\nThis notice includes a photograph which shows that he wore\nglasses.\nThe Birmingham Post repeats much of the above and states,\nfurther than Mr Macaulay was born at Southampton, and had been\nassociated with James Mansergh in big engineering schemes in the\nNorth of England.\nWhile some of these facts appeared in the Leonard sittings it is\nobvious that they form but a minute portion of the information\nthere given.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART 160\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS\nHAUNTING AND THE \" PSYCHIC ETHER \" HYPOTHESIS ;\nWITH SOME PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS ON THE\nPRESENT CONDITION AND POSSIBLE FUTURE OF\nPSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nBY\nH. H. Price\nWhen you did me the very great honour of inviting me to be your\nPresident, I am afraid I did not reflect sufficiently upon the obHga-\ntions of the office. The long series of exceedingly distinguished men\nwho have held this position before me have set a standard to which\nI cannot hope to attain. Moreover, though I have had the good\nfortune to be a member of the Society for several years, I must\nconfess that my knowledge of Psychical Research has been derived\nalmost entirely from reading, and hardly at all from personal in-\nvestigation. Nor has my reading been very extensive. As a pro-\nfessional philosopher, I am naturally interested in a subject which\nseems likely to throw entirely new light upon the nature of hmnan\npersonality and its position in the Universe. (Indeed I believe it\nmay do more : I believe that in time it may transform the whole\nintellectual outlook upon which our present civilisation is based.)\nBut I cannot claim any wide or detailed knowledge of the results\nhitherto achieved. So if I venture to make some suggestions which\nhave a bearing upon the future development of the subject, you\nmust understand that I speak as an onlooker\u2014an outsider if you\nlike\u2014and you must forgive the combination of ignorance and\ntemerity which I shall probably display.\nR 307\n\f308 H. H. Price [part\nIt seems to me that there are two main obstacles which are at\npresent holding up the progress of our enquiry. They are quite\ndifferent, and it may seem at first sight that there can be no con-\nnection between them. But if I am right, there is after all some\nconnection, and the removal of the one will help to remove the other\nas well.\nThe first obstacle is this. We do not yet know of any method\nby which supernormal phenomena can be produced and repeated\nat will by anyone who is prepared to take the requisite trouble.\nWe are still too much dependent upon the occurrence of \" spon-\ntaneous cases \". There was of course a time when we were almost\nwholly dependent on them. It was as if one could only study\nelectrical phenomena by waiting for an occasional thunderstorm.\nIndeed it was worse. For the phenomena (for example telepathic\nphantasms) were very seldom, if ever, observed directly by the\ninvestigator himself. They were reported to him by other people,\nand it was necessary to estal)lish the honesty and the accuracy of\nthe reports. With regard to a great many supernormal phenomena\n\u2014and those perhaps the most interesting ones\u2014we are still pre-\ncisely in that position. It is true that we have developed experi-\nmental methods for investigating Telepathy and Clairvoyance, and\nwe know how to analyse the results by means of an elaborate\nstatistical technique. The devising of these methods was a most\nimportant step forward. Nevertheless, they do not give us all we\nwant. Broadly speaking, they enable us to detect the presence of\n\" extra-sensory \" powers in any given person, and to measure the\ndegree in which they are present. But if our study is to become an\nexperimental science in the full sense of that phrase, we must be\nable to produce the phenomena whenever we like ; or if you prefer,\nwe must be able to ensure that they will happen. It is not enough\nto be able to detect and measure them when they do happen. We\nmust be able to arrange artificially a set of conditions, given which\na specified sort of phenomenon {e.g. the clairvoyant reading of a\nsealed letter) is reasonably certain to occur. We can then proceed\nto vary these conditions one by one, and to introduce new ones, and\nnotice the results. Moreover we must be able to describe these\nconditions fully and unambiguously ; so that any other investigator,\nno matter who, can repeat the process whenever he likes and verify\nour results.\nIt would be still better if the investigator could produce in himself\n(not merely in the other persons whom he studies) the phenomena\nwhich he desires to investigate. We need to know from within,\nby personal and first-hand experience, what it is like to see an\n\f160] Presidential Address 309\napparition in a haunted house, or to have a clairvoyant vision of an\nevent happening at a distance. If every trained psychologist\u2014dare\nI add, every trained philosopher?\u2014could have these experiences\nhimself, whenever he liked, under known and repeatable conditions,\nwe might be able to find out what sort of \" seeing \" or \" vision \" it\nis, and how much or how little analogy it has to the normal ex-\nperiences which go under these names. At present we have to\ndepend upon the testimony of persons who are no doubt honest and\nintelligent, but do not know what to look for, or how to describe\nit. Thus we have had to invent a number of technical terms\u2014such\nas \" Telepathy \" and \" Clairvoyance \"\u2014without any really clear\nnotion of the meaning we intend to attach to them.\nThis ideal which I have sketched, the ideal of a genuinely experi-\nmental science, based upon a direct and first-hand experience of\nthe phenomena, may well appear utterly unattainable. Certainly\nwe are a very long way from it at present. But I do not think we\nshould despair of achieving it, and I should like to suggest one or\ntwo lines of thought which may help us to find the way.\nIn the first place, we might appeal to the Physiologists and Bio-\nchemists. It is not at all inconceivable that some drug may be\ndiscovered which will give us what we want ; it is well known that\ncertain drugs, for example mescal, have the power of inducing\nsensory hallucinations. Indeed, the required drug may already\nhave been discovered or artificially produced. If it has been, the\nfact might easily have escaped our notice. In the present state of\nextreme scientific speciaUsation, its discoverer would probably not\neven ask himself whether it might be useful to Psychical Researchers.\n(We must remember too that even to-day our subject is viewed with\nvery considerable suspicion in scientific circles.) We have some\nreason to think that supernormal powers manifest themselves more\neasily when the normal functioning of the sense-organs is inhibited\nin some degree ; and I should imagine\u2014though of course I speak\nin complete ignorance\u2014that quite a number of chemical agencies\nmight have such an inhibiting effect.\nPerhaps this suggestion has already been followed up, with no\npositive result. If so, I apologise for making it, and I will now\nmake another which is on somewhat similar lines. Is it not possible\nthat prolonged \/asiin^r may lead to, or at least facilitate, the mani-\nfestation of supernormal cognitive powers? I suppose that the\neffects of fasting have been carefully studied by physiologists ; but\nhave they ever been studied with this question in mind ? It is surely\nsignificant that a number of religious traditions, Christian and\nnon-Christian, lay great stress on the importance of fasting, and hint\n\f310 H. H. Price [part\nvery strongly that there is a close connection between fasting and\n\" visions \" of one sort or another. I need only refer you to the\nbiographies of the Christian hermits and ascetics who flourished in\nfourth-century Egypt. Can we suppose that a practice which is\nso utterly repugnant to ordinary human nature would have been\nadopted so widely, and persisted in for so long, if it had not led to\nsome pretty striking experiences? You may say that the ex-\nperiences were \" spiritual \" rather than \" psychic \". But I think\nthat the stories which have come down to us, for instance in the\nlegend of St. Antony, suggest the contrary. When all necessary\nallowance has been made for hagiographical and theological en-\nthusiasm, I think there is a residuum left which deserves our serious\nconsideration. The Reformation did many disservices to mankind.\nPerhaps one of the greatest was this, that it made fasting un-\nfashionable\u2014not to say socially impossible\u2014among the more\nscientifically minded peoples of Europe. Before leaving the subject\nI might mention the reports that members of the Everest expedition\nand other similar expeditions experienced occasional hallucinations.\nThis might have been due to semi-starvation ; but of course it might\nalso have been due to reduced atmospheric pressure, and perhaps\nthat is another possibility which is worth investigating. (The\n'physiological effects of reduced atmosphere pressure have of course\nbeen pretty thoroughly studied already.)\nThirdly\u2014though I am afraid this suggestion will shock some of\nyou\u2014I do not think that we should be too proud to take any hints\nwe can get from the mystical and occult traditions of the Far East,\nparticularly of India. I am not suggesting for a moment that we\nshould accept their conclusions\u2014unless and until we succeed in\nverifying them for ourselves. What I have in mind is their methods,\nthe assemblage of physiological and j^sychological exercises which\nare roughly included under the name \" Yoga \", and the correspond-\ning ones which are practised in China and Tibet. ^ Though some of\nthese methods aim at inducing religious experiences of a mystical\nkind, there are others which profess to develop the \" psychic powers\n\"\nof the subject, including the powers of Telepathy and Clairvoyance ;\nfor it is assumed (not altogether unreasonably, I think) that these\n^ I think it is very much to be desired that a party of quaHfied Psychical\nResearchers should visit Tibet ; for in that country the traditions which I have\nm mind remain in full force, almost untouched by Western influences. I know\nthat the difficulties\u2014financial, linguistic, and even political\u2014^would be enor-\nmous. But moimtain-climbers and naturalists can manage to overcome\nthem. New light on the human mind is far more worth having than a Giant\nPanda.\n\f160] Presidential Address 311\npowers are present in every normal human being, though in a latent\nstate. These methods may appear to us peculiar, or even repellent.\nNevertheless, it is claimed that their effectiveness can be empirically\nverified by anyone who is prepared to take the requisite trouble. And\nI think that this is a claim which ought to be seriously investigated.\nBefore I leave this part of my subject, there is one other suggestion\nI have to make. It may appear naive to the point of childishness.\nOne has the impression\u2014I do not know how far statistics support\nit\u2014that supernormal experiences are relatively uncommon among\nhighly educated persons. (There are of course striking exceptions :\nfor instance Swedenborg and perhaps Socrates. But I think they\nare not numerous.) There is some reason for supposing that these\nexperiences were more frequent in earlier and less civilised ages ; and\nthat at this day they are more common among the less advanced\npeoples of the world than they are among ourselves. There is also\nsome evidence that experiences of this sort are more likely to occur\nwhen intellectual processes are somewhat in abeyance : as in states\nof fatigue or illness or at the point of death. The appearances, then,\ndo at least suggest that supernormal cognitive powers tend to be\nfeeble or non-existent where the power of abstract thinking is great.\nNow there is a possible explanation for this, which it may be instruc-\ntive to consider. The more abstract our thinking is, the more it\nhas to be carried on by means of words ; or by means of other\nconventional symbols, for instance algebraic ones, which for our\npresent purposes may be taken as a sort of words. But it is also\npossible to think by means of itmiges. For highly abstract topics\nimages are useless, but they serve well enough for relatively concrete\nones ; and it is possible, and it may be relevant, that they are more\nclosely connected with the emotional side of our nature.\nNow almost the whole of our present higher education, in so far\nas it does not consist in imparting information, is designed to increase\nour capacity of verbal thinking (including under that head the\nmanipulation of mathematical symbols.) And this is perfectly\nnatural. For speaking broadly, this education has two main aims.\nIf it is of the scientific sort, its aim is to produce scientists and\nscientific technicians. If it is of the humanistic sort, its aim is to\nproduce administrators in a wide sense of the word. These are the\ntwo most important classes of persons in our present civilisation ;\nthe scientists and technicians on the one hand, the administrators\non the other. And it is obvious at a glance that neither of them\ncould carry on their work for more than a few minutes by means of\nimage-thinking alone. Thanks to the very advanced state of our\nscientific technique, and the unparalleled complexity of our social\n\f312 H. H. Price [part\norganisation, we probably live in the most word-ridden age that the\nworld has ever seen. Image-thinking, on the other hand, is syste-\nmatically repressed in youth by our whole system of higher educa-\ntion, and by the whole weight of the \" educated attitude \" of those\namong whom the adult subsequently hves and moves. Not that it\nis eradicated altogether ; it turns up again in moments of fatigue\nor disease or relaxed attention, in dreams, in the hypnagogic and\nhypnopompic experiences which are intermediate between sleeping\nand waking. It has only been more or less completely inhibited\nin the sane, waking, normal life of highly educated persons.\nNow I want to suggest that this exclusive cultivation of verbal\nthinking may be adverse to the development of supernormal cogni-\ntive powers ; that such powers manifest themselves more readily\nin persons whose thought is mainly conducted in images (persons\nof the \" intuitive \" rather than the \" abstract \" type ^) ; and that\nthis is the reason why such powers are relatively more common\namong uneducated persons, children, and primitive races ; and\nmoreover that it is the reason why they tend to emerge more easily\nin sleep and in states of relaxed attention or mild dissociation.\nIf I am right in this suggestion (which I admit is something of a\nshot in the dark) an important practical consequence follows.\nInvestigators of supernormal phenomena ought to make a deliberate\neffort to cultivate their own powers of image-thinking. In this way\nthey should increase their chances of obtaining first-hand super-\nnormal experiences in their own persons. And of course they\nshould encourage other people to do the same. But indeed the word\n\" cultivate \" perhaps gives a false and unduly disheartening im-\npression. I think it is not really a case of increasing a power which\none has in a feeble degree : but rather of attaining or recovering\nconscious control of a power which is already functioning abundantly.\nFor it is plausible to suggest that image-thinking is going on in aU\nof us all the time, but that in highly-educated persons it has got\ndissociated from the main stream of their daylight waking con-\nsciousness. (Cf. the suggestion that we are dreaming all day long\nas well as at night, but only notice it when we are asleep.) In fact,\nthe intellectual and abstract-thinking man is something of a split\npersonality, a little mad if you like : a conclusion which need not\nsurprise us! As some philosopher has said, \" nous vivons sur la\n^ The word \" intuitive \" is one which the professional philosopher dislikes,\nowing to the many different meanings which it has borne in the course of the\nhistory of Philosophy. But I think that in ordinary life and conversation it\nis sometimes ajjplied to the image-thinking as opposed to the abstract-thinking\ntype of person.\n\f160] Presidential Address 313\nsurface de notre etre \". The thing for us to do, then, is to re-\nassociate our image-thinking with the main stream of our waking\nconsciousness : to break down a barrier which cuts off a fully active\nfaculty from our view, rather than to revive by toilsome exercise\none which has become atrophied through long disuse. Not that\neven this removal of barriers is an easy task ; but experience shows,\nI think, that it is a practicable one. And perhaps the other measures\nwhich I suggested may assist us in it. Perhaps that is the point\nof them, if they do have the efficacy which I tentatively attributed\nto them. We all know that the emergence of images into conscious-\nness is facilitated by certain physiological states, such as fatigue.\nPerhaps the drug we are looking for is one which wall induce the\nrequired physiological condition artificially ;\npossibly abstinence\nfrom food may also favour the free emergence of images, and the\nbreathing exercises and bodily postures of the Yogis may do the\nsame. Perhaps this is also the point of the auto-hypnosis which\noccurs in crystal-gazing and similar practices. Its immediate effect\nmay be to facilitate the emergence of images, and thus indirectly\nset free the subject's clairvoyant powers. I have of course been\nassuming throughout\u2014and it is an old and a reasonable assumption\n\u2014that supernormal cognitive j)Owers are in fact possessed by every-\none and even that they are active in everyone to some extent. I\nhave been assuming, following F. W. H. Myers, that the difference\nbetween \" sensitives \" and the rest of us is just a difference in the\nnormal position of the threshold of consciousness. If this is indeed\nthe difference, it should not be beyond the wit of man to remove it\nby one means or another. That is the point of all the suggestions\nI have been making. If I am right, the obstacles are specially great\nin the case of highly-educated persons. But I see no reason why\nwe should despair of overcoming them even there. And if once they\nwere overcome, the way would be open for an enormous advance in\nthe investigation of supernormal phenomena.\nOne more remark before I leave this part of my subject. It may\nwell be that the supernormal powers function on some \" deeper\n\"\nlevel than the level of image-tliinking. But even so, images might\nbe their jyroximate manifestation ; whereas their manifestation at\nthe level of verbal thinking might be far less direct, and inhibited by\nall sorts of additional counter-forces. We may compare the fact\nthat dreams (which are a kind of image-thinking) seem to be the\nproximate manifestation of our unconscious wishes ; and that these\nwishes \" get through \" into ordinary waking life only occasionally\nand as it were furtively, in slips of the tongue, apparently accidental\nactions and the like.\n\f314 H. H. Price [part\nSo much then for the first main obstacle which obstructs the\nprogress of Psychical Kesearch at the present time : the lack of\nany reasonably certain method by which the phenomena may be\nobtained at will, and repeated, by anyone who takes the necessary\ntrouble. I turn now to the other main obstacle which confronts us.\nIt is equally serious, and even more obvious\u2014indeed it is perfectly\nfamiliar to us all. Dare I suggest that it may become even too\nfamiliar? that one is in some danger (I speak for myself) of getting\nused to it and acquiescing in it, as in something permanent and\ninevitable ?\nThe obstacle I refer to is this. We need, and have not got, a\ncoinqwehensive hypothesis which will bind together all our phenomena,\nor as many of them as possible, in one unified intellectual scheme.\nWe have now collected a very large mass of well-attested facts.\nMost people who have examined the evidence are now agreed that\nthe occurrence of Telepathy, Clairvoyance and Haunting is pretty\nfirmly established. We can say the same of the cognitive phenomena\nof Mediumship. I do not think we can say it of the physical pheno-\nmena at present ; though here we must remember that in Poltergeist\nphenomena, the evidence for which is quite good and fairly abundant,\nwe find something which is anyhow analogous to the alleged per-\nformances of \" physical \" or \" telekinetic \" mediums. Further, it\nseems to me that the evidence for Precognition is also fairly good.\nBut here there is a special difficulty. Some investigators seem to\nthink that Precognition is logically itnpossible , that the word stands\nfor a self-contradictory concept. I do not myself take that view.\nBut if they are right, of course no amount of evidence could esta-\nblish the occurrence of Precognition, just as no amount of evidence\ncould establish the existence of a square table which is also circular.\nLastly, with regard to the \" great question \" of Survival we know\nthat there are great differences of opinion among those who are best\nqualified to speak. But I think most of us will agree with Professor\nBroad that the phenomena which have been established greatly\nlessen the antecedent improbability of Survival, by showing that the\nembodied human mind has cognitive powers which to all appearances\ndo not depend upon processes in its sense-organs and central nervous\nsystem. And I think most of us will also agree that such evidence\nas the Willett scripts provide at any rate confronts us with this\ndilemma : either discarnate minds exist and can communicate with\nthe living, or else some incarnate human minds possess telepathic\nand clairvoyant faculties of a staggeringly extensive liind.\nSo much for the reasonably well-estabKshed facts. But as to the\nexplanation of them, we remain almost as much in the dark as the\n\f160] Presidential Address 315\npioneers of our enquiry fifty years ago. We can see, as they did,\nthat all these phenomena have their seat in the \" subliminal\n\"\nstratum of our personalities. But we can see very little more.\nWe can form no conception, or hardly any, of the modus operandi\nof Telepathy and Clairvoyance. We have good reason to think that\nMediumship has some very close connection with the phenomena of\ndissociated and alternating personality discussed by psychologists\nand psycho-therapists ; but we cannot go much farther than that.\nAgain, if discarnate minds exist, we cannot conceive what manner\nof existence they enjoy, without physical sense-organs, or physical\norgans of action such as incarnate minds possess. For the whole\nof mental life as we know it here is based upon two sorts of ex-\nperience : the experience of sense-perception on the one hand, the\nexperience of action on the other. And how could either of these\noccur in the absence of a body and a nervous system? I hazard the\nsuggestion indeed that the real difficulty about the Survivalist\nTheory at present is not so much the lack of evidence\u2014there is\nquite a lot of evidence which favours it\u2014but rather the apparent\nimintelligibility of the theory itself. What I said about Pre-\ncognition just now applies to Survival too. If the very notion of\nan unembodied mental life is self-contradictory (and some persons\nof the highest intelligence have thought so), then no amount of\nevidence, however great, will do anything whatever to support the\nSuxvivalist hypothesis ; for it will not really be a hypothesis at all,\nbut just a meaningless combination of words, which cannot even\nbe called false. I do not myself believe that the notion of an\nunembodied mental life is self-contradictory, but I do think it is an\nextremely puzzling and difficult one.\nIf I may venture to speak as a professional philosopher for a\nmoment, and offer as it were professional advice, I would suggest\nthat those who incline to the Survivalist hypothesis should spend\nless of their time collecting evidence for it, and should rather turn\ntheir attention for the present to the clarification of the hypothesis\nitself. If they can succeed in shewing that it is an intelligible and\nself-consistent hypothesis, in short, that it is a hypothesis and not\na meaningless combination of words (and I am inclined to think that\nthey could), they could then return to the task of collecting evidence\nfor it with the assurance that their labour would not be wasted.\nI have now offered a very brief survey of the present condition of\nour subject (so far as an onlooker may) ; and I am afraid that in\nspite of all the excellent work which has been done, it is still a scene\nof twilight and confusion, so far as the understanding of the pheno-\nmena is concerned. Our situation is rather like that of Physics and\n\f316 H. H. Price [part\nChemistry in the sixteenth century, before it had yet occurred to\npeople that the large-scale properties of bodies could be explained\nby the motions and configurations of their minute parts : or rather,\nbefore that suggestion had been taken seriously, and while it was as\nyet a mere metaphysical speculation, put forward by one or two singu-\nlar men two thousand years before. Until this obstacle has been\novercome, it is obvious that our subject cannot become a science in\nthe fviU sense of that word. And it is also obvious that this obstacle\nis, after all, closely connected with the other one which we discussed\npreviously. Until one has a fairly comprehensive theory, however\ninadequate, one cannot use the experimental method with much\nprofit. For that method, as Kant said, is eventually a way of forcing\nNature to answer our questions, and before we can employ it, we must\nhave a reasonably clear idea of the questions which we wish to ask.\nIn this situation, I think that our only safety lies in boldness. In\nthe collection of facts, one cannot be over-cautious. But in the\ninvention of theories, especially in a field so peculiar as ours, where\nanalogies drawn from the existing sciences are almost useless, a\ncanny and sober circumspection would be the greatest mistake. If\npeople accuse us of being speculative and even \" metaphysical \" we\nmust refuse to be frightened. We must postulate unverifiable\nentities and processes if we cannot get on without them. The task\nof philosophical deflation, of removing unnecessary metaphysical\nentities, comes at the end of a science's progress, not at the begin-\nning ; if such writers as Hume and Mach and the modern Logical\nPositivists had lived in the early seventeenth century, Physics\nwould never have got itself started. In short, we must not be\ndeterred by the fear of talking nonsense. If this maxim applies to\nthe early stages of any science whatever, it applies with a quite\nspecial force to Psychical Research. The phenomena with which\nwe are concerned are so peculiar, and so unlike those visible and\ntangible facts which ordinary language is designed to deal with, that\nthe right theory of them is hound to seem nonsense when first pro-\npounded. If we are still frightened, we may take comfort from the\nhistory of Psychology in the last thirty years. The statements\n\" Smith is two different people at the same time \" or \" Smith is\none person on Thursday and another on Friday\n'\n' are on the face of\nthem sheer nonsense ;\nthey contradict our ordinary rules for the\nuse of the word \" person \". Yet nobody (except a few very old-\nfashioned philosophers) would now object to the conceptions of Dual\nand Alternating Personality, or deny that they have thrown great\nfight on some of the most obscure phenomena of the human mind.\nMoreover, in our search for a comprehensive hypothesis we must\n\f160] Presidential Address 317\nnot mind taking hints from quarters which are accounted scientifi-\ncally disreputable. I am thinking again of the occult and mystical\ntraditions of the Far East. It is well to remember that in India and\nthe Buddhist countries men not necessarily inferior to Europeans in\nintelligence have been devoting themselves for very many centuries\nto the deepening and extension of human consciousness. In fact,\nin a rather unscientific way they have been practising a kind of\nPsychical Research for well over two thousand years. The theories\nwhich they have been led to frame may have got mixed up with all\nsorts of dubious theological and cosmological dogmas. Nevertheless\nthey may give us some help in framing a more adequate and genuinely\nscientific theory for ourselves. We cannot afford to despise any\nuseful suggestion, from whatever quarter it may come. I even think\nthat the humble savage may have something to teach us. It is\ngreatly to be wished that more Anthropologists should be trained in\nPsychical Research, and more Psychical Researchers in Anthropo-\nlogy. Even the most cuisory reading of Anthropological literature\nis sufficient to shew that Anthropologists have collected a whole\nmass of material which falls within our province, though their\nscientific orthodoxy has usually led them to assume that it tnust\nsomehow be explained away as fraud and delusion.\nBut it is time for me to leave these general considerations and try\nto practise what I preach. There is one fairly comprehensive\nhypothesis which has commended itself in various forms to a number\nof enquirers, and I shall devote the rest of this paper to the discussion\nof it. If it is tenable it enables us to connect together quite a wide\nrange of supernormal phenomena. This is the hypothesis of a\nsomething intermediate between mind and matter as we ordinarily\nunderstand them : something which is in some sense material\nbecause it is extended in space (though not necessarily in Physical\nSpace) and yet has some of the properties commonly attributed to\nminds. This something was called by Frederic Myers \" the\nMetetherial \". More recently Mr. C. A. Mace, in a very interesting\naddress to this Society, has spoken of a \" Psychic Ether \". In the\nmystical literatm'e of the Far East we meet the same thing under\nthe name of Akasa, which again is usually translated \" ether \".\nHere I may mention a noteworthy point about these same Eastern\ntraditions. In the Sankhya philosophy,^ one of the six classical\n1 The word Sankhya appears to mean something like \" enumeration \"\\ Cf.\nthe dictum\u2014I think it is the late Professor Alexander's\u2014that the task of\nphilosophy is \"to make an inventory of all the main types of entity in the\nUniverse \".\n\f318 H. H. Price [part\nIndian systems, we find a very sharp dualism between Purusha\n(self or knowing subject) on the one side, and Prakriti (usually\ntranslated \" matter \") on the other. At first sight this reminds us\nof the equally sharp dualism of Descartes between mind and matter.\nBut on further examination we are astonished to find that the line\nis not drawn at all where Descartes drew it. Very much of what\nwe are accustomed to call \" mind \" is in the Sankhya system regarded\nas material. Indeed everything that we call mental, except only pure\nawareness, falls on the material side ; of course it has then to be\nadded that there are other forms of matter besides those revealed\nto our ordinary senses. This idea, or something not unlike it, has\nnot been wholly unknown in our own philosophical tradition.\nSome Western philosophers have rejected the familiar two-fold\ndivision of matter and mind, and have preferred the threefold\ndivision of matter, soul and spirit. Here \" spirit \" corresponds\nto the Purusha of the Sankhya system, while \" matter \" and\n\" soul \" together would correspond to Prakriti. At any rate\nin both cases we have something intermediate between spirit\nand ordinary visible or tangible matter ; and whether we reserve\nthe special name \" soul \" (ifjvx'q) for this something, or say that\nit is a \" higher\" sort of matter, does not make so very much\ndifference.\nHowever this may be, let us assume for the moment that there is\nsuch an intermediate something and let us follow Mr. Mace in calling\nit the \" Psychic Ether \". In the remainder of this paper I shall\nfirst try to make this elusive conception a little more definite ; and\nI shall then try to show how it might be used for the explanation of\ncertain supernormal phenomena, notably the phenomena of\nHaunting.\nI want to start by returning to a topic which I have already\ntouched on in quite a different connection, the topic of mental images.\nPhilosophers and Psychologists have always supposed that mental\nimages are \" subjective \" : that is, that any given image is wholly\ndependent for its existence upon the mind, and perhaps also upon\nthe brain, of the person who is aware of it, and moreover that it is\nprivate to that person. They have also usually supposed, though\nnot quite always, that images are evanescent entities, which have no\nexistence (not even a mind-dependent existence) either before or\nafter the date at which we are aware of them ; so that I cannot be\naware of the same image to-day as I was aware of yesterday\u2014an\nassumption which of course does not necessarily follow from the\nprevious assumption of privacy and mind-dependence. Now\nwhat is the evidence for these two assumptions? I do not think\n\f160] Presidential Address 319\nthere is any conclusive evidence for either of them. The mere fact\nthat images are commonly called \" mental \" is no evidence. The\nreason why we call them so is merely the fact that they are not\napprehended by means of the ordinary physical sense-organs, such\nas the eye and the ear. They might well be mental in this sense\nwithout being on that account mind-dependent, or private, or\nevanescent. Perhaps it will be said that they are obviously \" in\n\"\nthe mind which is aware of them. But this sort of argument, so\nfamiliar in the History of Philosophy, will now deceive nobody. It\nis either repeating in different words the very thing which has to be\nestabhshed\n\u2014\" in \" may be just a synonym for \" dependent on \".\nOr else it is only saying that they are entities which we are directly\nand immediately aware of. Certainly we are, but nothing follows\nfrom this about their nature. Something which is \" in \" the\nmind in this latter sense might perfectly well also exist \" out\nof \"it.\nI think then that we are entitled to deny these assumptions if we\nlike. Let us make the experiment of doing so. We will indeed\nconcede that every image is originated by a mental act\u2014not neces-\nsarily a conscious one\u2014and that this act has its physiological corre-\nlate. But we will suppose that, once it has come into being, the\nimage has a tendency to persist in being ; and that it is not dependent\nupon the mind for its continuance, as it was for its origination. The\nmind which originated it might be aware of it from time to time\nthereafter ; it might be \" summoned up into consciousness\n\"\noccasionally, or pop up of its own accord. But conceivably its\nwhole career from start to finish might be passed in the Unconscious.\nWe will also suppose that it is not necessarily private to the mind of\nits original author, but is capable of presenting itself in suitable\ncircumstances to other minds as well.\nHow should the persistence of an image be conceived? I should\nsuppose that it is more analogous to the persistence of a process\n{e.g. a prolonged noise) than to the persistence of a thing, such as a\nbrickbat. But I think this is a question of purely philosophical\ninterest, which need not concern us here. For our purpose no great\nharm will be done if we speak of a persisting image as a kind of thing,\neven though this is not strictly accurate.\nI wish now to take a further step. Let us suppose that images\nare not only persistent entities, but are endowed with causal pro-\nperties. If you prefer to put it so, we will say that they are \" dyna-\nmic \" rather than \" static \" entities, endowed with a kind of \" force\n\"\nof their own. I am not referring only to what Psychologists call\nIdeo-motor Action, though that is part of what I mean ; nor even\n\f320 H. H. Price [part\nto what is called Association of Ideas\/ thougli that again is part of\nwhat I mean. I am thinking primarily of Telepathy. I know this\nsounds absm-d. Telepathy is commonly regarded as a relation\nbetween two minds or personalities. But is it not possible that the\nrelation between the two minds is derivative, and that the primary\nand fundamental relation is one between two ?nenfal contents'^.\nPerhaps the primary fact is that one mental content is capable of\nmodifying or even of generating another ; and when the two con-\ntents happen to be contents of two different minds, we call the result\nTelepathy. Now images are one important sort of mental contents.\nLet us suppose then that every image is endowed with a kind of\ntelepathic charge, enabling it to modify or even perhaps to generate\nother mental contents, which need not necessarily be contents in\nthe mind of its original author. This charge might vary in all sorts\nof ways as between one image and another. It might also tend to\ndecrease with lapse of time, and we might suppose that when it\nfinally vanishes, the image itself ceases to exist. Thus some images\nmight persist in being, and retain their causal properties, for a very\nlong time ; while others might fade away quite quickly, and some\nperhaps would hardly outlast the act by which they were first\noriginated.\nNow if it is legitimate to think of images in this way\u2014as persistent\nand dynamic entities independent of the mind of their original\nauthor, and able to escape as it were from his control\u2014we might be\nable to form some more definite notion of the Psychic Ether. It\nmight be an ether of images. If it were, I think it would have the\nkind of properties which we require it to have. For an ether of\nimages would be something intermediate between mind and matter\nas we ordinarily conceive of them ; while if we were prepared to\nstretch these conceptions a good deal, then we could either call it\nmental or call it material, as we liked. I will now try to explain this.\nWe are all familiar with the hypothesis of a Collective or Common\nUnconscious. The suggestion is that although our conscious\npersonalities are isolated, yet in the deeper levels of the Unconscious\nthe distinction between I and you no longer exists. What does this\nsuggestion really come to? No doubt we picture the Common\nUnconscious as a kind of continent, out of which our conscious\npersonalities arise lilie isolated mountain peaks. But this is after\nall only a picture, useful as it may be. The unity of the Common\n1 Is it possible that Association by Resemblance might occur without unity\nof consciousness, so that an \" idea \" in my mind could be associatively ILaked,\nby resemblance, with an \" idea \" in yours? Or is this suggestion too non-\nsensical?\n\f.160] Presidential Address 321\nUnconscious cannot really be very like the spatial continuity of a\ncontinent. I think that the hypothesis of a Common Unconscious\nis to be regarded as a causal hypothesis. Suppose that a content\nin my unconscious could directly affect a content in yours, and vice\nversa, without any physical intermediary : for example, suppose\nthat a suppressed wish in me could directly cause a dream in you, and\nconversely. Suppose that this happened with every content of my\nunconscious and every content of yours. If this were so, what sense\nwould there be in speaking of the one unconscious as yours \" and\nthe others as \"mine\"? Clearly there would be none. For the\nimity of any unconscious can only be defined in causal terms. It is\na unity of law, or of interaction, since it cannot be a unity of space.\nThus the hypothesis of a Common Unconscious is only another way\nof saying that at their deeper levels all personalities are in complete\nand contmuous telepathic rapport. It is not an explanation of such\nrapport, as it is sometimes thought to be, but only another way of\ndescribing it. (There are further compHcations in this hypothesis,\nwhich I will mention but not discuss. This telepathic rapport\nmight have different degrees of extensiveness, and perhaps different\ndegrees of intensiveness as well. It might be that each person's\nunconscious interacted with everyone else's ; or only with some\nother people's. Again, as between Smith and IVIrs. Smith it might\nbe complete\u2014every content of the one might affect every content\nof the other all the time\u2014whereas between Smith and Robinson it\nmight be incomplete and intermittent. Further, it might be either\nunilateral or reciprocal. A's mind might affect B's, whereas B's\nmind did not affect A's, or not so much ; or both might affect each\nother equally. When we take account of all these possibilities, we\nsee that the structure of the Common Unconscious might be ex-\nceedingly comphcated. Considered as a whole, it might have a very\nweak and washy sort of unity, whereas there might be a number of\nvery strong and intimate unities within it. We coidd not then ask\n\" Are personahty A and personahty B united or separate? \" We\nshould have to ask instead \" How much, of a unity is there between\nthem? \")\nNow I can return to the Ether of Images. When I suggested that\nimages might be dynamic entities as well as persistent ones, and\nthat each was endowed with a telepathic charge, this was only a\nspecial and hmited form of the hypothesis of a Common Unconscious:\nlimited, because images are only one sort of mental contents. The\nEther of Images could equally well be described as a certain level or\nrange (perhaps rather a superficial one) within the Common Uncon-\nscious : that level or range of it at which images persist and interact\n\f322 H. H. Price [PART'\nwith each other more or less freely, no matter whose mind they\nbegan their career in. For the laws of their interaction, and the\ncausal properties manifested in it, are psychological laws and pro-\nperties, though they considerably transcend the perview of Orthodox\nPsychology, since Telepathy is included among them. I hope I have\nshewn, then, that the Ether of Images has mental properties ; we\ncould even say, with a certain stretching of language, that it actually\nis a certain level within a common unconscious mind.\nIt remains to shew that the Ether of Images has material pro-\nperties as well ;\nnaturally they will not be the same properties as\nwe ascribe to ordinary matter, but they might be somewhat like\nthem. Here the fundamental point is that images are spatial\nentities. But they are spatial in a curious half-way-house kind of\nfashion, which disconcerts us at first because we seldom reflect on\nthem (our ordinary tendency is to think by means of them rather\nthan about them). I will consider visual images mainly, but what\nI have to say applies to tactual and kinsesthetic images too, and\nperhaps to the other sorts. An image, then, has extension ; it has\na shape, sometimes even a stereoscopic shape. But it does not\nnecessarily have location. Of course the parts of a given image A\nare located in relation to other parts of that same image. One part\nis above another or to the left of another. This follows from the\nfact that A is an extended entity. Again the image A may happen\nto form part of an image-field (the image of a cat may form part of\nthe image of a drawing-room) : and in that case we can say that A\nis located in relation to the other members of the same image-field.\nBut we cannot say that the image-field as a whole is located any-\nwhere. It is spatial, in that it is extended and has spatial relations\nwithin it, but it forms as it were a spatial world of its own. Likewise\nif A is an isolated image, as it may be, we cannot say that A as a\nwhole is anywhere, though we can say where every part is in relation\nto other parts. (We may either regard the isolated image as a\nparticularly simple image-field ; or we may regard the image-field\nas a partictdarly complex single image.) I think that similar\nconsiderations apply to size as well. If I have an image of a cat on\na hearthrug, I can say that the hearthrug-like part of the image is\nlarger than the cat-like part, and within the cat-like part the tail is\nlonger than the left-hand ear. But I do not think it is even intelli-\ngible to ask how large the image as a whole is : (for example, is it\nlarger or smaller than someone else's image of Mont Blanc?). What\nI have said about location obviously applies to motion too, and what\nI have said about size applies to changes of size. An image can\nmove within its own image-field, and can change its size in relation\n\f160] Presidential Address 323\nto other images in the same field. But it cannot intelhgibly be said\nto move from one image-field to another, nor to have grown larger or\nsmaller on the way. Or if we obstinately insist on saying that all\nimage-fields miist be \" somewhere \", i.e. that there is a single space\nwithin which all images whatever are located, then we shall have to\nsay that an image can move from one place to another without\npassing through the intermediate places. But I think it is better to\nsay, as I have, that different image-fields are not interrelated\nspatially at all, though each in itself is spatial ; and that the unifying\nfactor which unites them all into one single Ether of Images is not\nspatial but causal.\nIf this still does not satisfy you, I will make a further suggestion.\nAlthough there is nothing in the image-world which resembles the\nrelation of distance in the physical world\u2014since one image-field is\nneither near to nor far from another\u2014yet there might be something\nwhich has a faint analogy to it. It might be that in the Ether of\nImages there are greater or lesser degrees of telepathic affinity as\nbetween one image and another ; and there might be some degree\nof telepathic affinity, however slight, between every image and every\nother. And if such relations of affinity should happen to constitute\nan order having dimensions, we might then be able to say that there\nis an all-embracing image-space after all. But if so, it will be a\ndifferent kind of space from the one which we find within any one\nimage or any one image-field. It need not have three dimensions.\nAnd even if it had. there would be no detailed correspondence\nbetween it and the space of the Physical World. A's body and B's\nbody might be very close to each other in Physical Space, and yet\nA's images and B's images might be very distant from each other in\nthe image-world. For there might be very little telepathic affinity\nbetween A's images and B's, despite the relation of physical proxi-\nmity between their respective bodies ;\nconversely, there might be\nthe most intimate telepathic rapport between A and B, though their\nbodies were a thousand miles apart.\nI have now tried to show that an Ether of Images would have both\nmental and material properties. It is either a queer sort of mental\nworld or a queer sort of material world, as we like, though neither\nthe word \" mental \" nor the word \" material \" can be applied to it\nwithout a certain misfit and discomfort. Indeed all this talk of an\nEther of Images, or of a Psychic Ether at all, may well seem like sheer\nnonsense when considered in cold blood. But as we saw earlier, this\nis only to be expected. Any theory of these difficult matters is\nbound to give our ordinary language-habits a pretty violent tweak.\nIf it does not, we can be sure that there is something wrong with it.\ns\n\f324 H. H. Price [part\nI now want to illustrate the explanatory value of my hypothesis\nby applying it to the phenomena of Haunting ^\n;\nperhaps it will have\nto be modified somewhat in the process, and will emerge at the end\nlooking even queerer than it did at the beginning. We may divide\nthe phenomena provisionally into two classes : haunting without\nphysical effects, and haunting with physical effects. The second\nclass would often be lumped together under the head of \" poltergeist\nphenomena \". But I think this is inadvisable, at any rate as a first\nstep. For sometimes the physical effects have at any rate the prima\nfacie appearance of being produced by a discarnate mind, whereas\npoltergeist phenomena proper seem to be produced \" mediumisti-\ncally \" by the agency of an incarnate one. However, it is haunting\nwithout physical effects which I wish to consider here : that is, cases\nin which the haunting consists solely in the repeated occurrence of\nphantasms or apparitions in a certain locality, including the occur-\nrence of phantasmal smells or noises or touches. And let us suppose,\nfor the sake of definiteness, that the haunted locality is a certain\nroom in a certain house.\nNow it has often been suggested that such apparitions are due to\nsome sort of locahsed trace or vestige or impress left in the matter\nof the room. These traces would be the quite automatic result of\nthe emotions or other experiences of some person who formerly\ninhabited the room, much as finger-prints result automatically from\nour handling of a wine-glass or a poker. Thus on this view the\napparition is not a revenant, as popular superstition supposes\u2014not a\ndeceased personality revisiting the scenes of its former experience\nnor yet an \" earth-bound spirit \" lingering on in them\u2014but is some-\nthing more like a photograph or a cinematograph picture. (The\nphysical trace would correspond to the photographic negative ; and\nit would be as it were \" developed \" when anyone with a suitable\nmind and nervous system enters the room.) This is what Signor\nBozzano calls \" the Psychometrical Theory \" of Haunting. For in\nPsychometry too we seem to find that a material object retains traces\nof the past experiences of a person who was formerly in physical\ncontact with it. Signor Bozzano himself holds that this Psycho-\nmetrical Theory fits only some cases of haunting, indeed only a\nrelatively small number, and that the majority must be explained\nby the activity of surviving and discarnate personalities, an activity\nwhich may either l^e of the automatic and somnambulistic sort, or\nof the conscious and intelligent sort. In this he may be right. But\n' I shoukl like here to express my great obligation to Signor Ernest Bozzano's\nbook Les Phenomenes de Hantise (Alean, Paris, 1929).\n\f160] Presidential Address 325\nit seems a good methodological principle to push the Psychometrical\nTheory as far as ever it will go.\nNow if we attempt to work out this theory in detail, I think we\nare driven to combine it with the Psychic Ether hypothesis. For\nthese traces, or whatever they are, are not of course independently\nobservable in the physical matter of the room, for instance in the\nwalls or furniture. (Contrast the traces on a gramophone record.\nThese are independently observable, as well as the sounds which they\nenable us to hear.) If they are indeed physical traces, they must\nconsist in some more or less permanent mode of arrangement of the\nmolecules or atoms or infra-atomic particles, of which the walls,\nfurniture, etc., are composed. And in that case, it ought to be\npossible to verify their existence by the ordinary methods of Physical\nScience\u2014by physical or chemical tests of some sort or other. But\nso far as we know, tliis cannot be done. It is therefore natural to\nsuggest that the seat of these traces is something which is not\nmaterial in the ordinary sense, but somehow interpenetrates the\nwalls or the furniture or whatever it may be : something which is\nLike matter in being extended, and yet like mind in that it retains in\nitself the residua of past experiences. And this is just what the\nPsychic Ether is supposed to be.\nWe have tried to conceive of the Psychic Ether as an ether of\nimages. Will this conception of it fit in with the requirements of a\npsychometrical theory of haunting? I want to show that it will.\nBut I admit that there are difficulties ; and in order to surmount\nthem we shall have to introduce fresh complications.\nThe essential point in ova previous discussion was of course the\nsuggestion that images are persistent and dynamic entities, which\nwhen once formed may have a kind of independent life of their own,\nand may escape more or less completely from the control of their\nauthor. Let us now suppose\u2014despite of what we said earher about\ntheir spatial properties\u2014that in certain special circumstances an\nimage or group of images might get itself localised in a particular\nregion of Physical Space. (What circumstances, we shall see later.)\nOnce localised there, they might continue to be so locaHsed for a\nconsiderable period, retaining the telepathic charge which they had\nat fijst, though this might gradually diminish in intensity. Suppose\nthat a human being now enters the room ; and suppose there is a\ntelepathic affinity between the contents of his mind on the one hand,\nand these persisting and localised images on the other. A telepathic\nprocess then occurs. The result of this might only be that the\nvisitor feels a feeling of emotional malaise\u2014which is not uncommon\nin haunted places\u2014accompanied perhaps by what is called a sense\n\f326 H. H. Price [part\nof presence \". Or again it might be a dream. Or finally, in the\nmost favourable cases, it might be the generation of a phantasm\nlocated in his ordinary waking visual field (or tactual field as the case\nmay be). This apparition might be related to the persisting image\nin much the same kind of way as the visual sense-datum of a chair\nis related to the physical chair. For it would certainly be generated\nby a process originating in the image (a purely psychical one, to be\nsure, not a psycho-physical one) and it would be located in approxi-\nmately the same place ; its shape might also be a perspectified\naspect of the shape which the image has. When a man is aware of\nan ordinary sense-datum which is related to a chair in this sort of\nway, we say he is 'perceiving the chair. And so we should be entitled\nto say here that he is perceiving the persistent and localised image.\nMoreover, if there were other persons in the room whose mental\ncontents had the required telepathic affinity with the persisting\nimage, we could say that these other persons too were perceiving\nthe persistent image as well as he. Likewise he or others might\nperceive it again on some later occasion. Thus the persisting image\nwould be a kind of \" public object \", as the chair is ;\nexcept that\nit would be \" public to \" a restricted class of persons\u2014namely all\nthose, and only those, whose mental contents had the requisite\nminimum ^ of telepathic affinity with it\u2014whereas the chair is public\nto all percipients with normal eyesight. On the other hand, though\npublic to different people, it would not necessarily be public to\ndifferent senses. It might be visible but not tangible, or tangible\nbut not visible ; or perhaps it could only be heard or smelt.\nThere is a further point which may be worth mentioning. If\nwe now take into account the fact that the persisting image did\noriginate in a living human mind, perhaps a long time ago ; and if\nwe prefer to conceive of telepathy as primarily a relation between\nmind and mind, and not just between mental contents : then we\nmay say that haunting is a kind of deferred telepathy, resulting in the\nproduction of a post-dated telepathic phantasm.. It will be a telepathic\ntransaction between Smith as he was ten years ago, when he lived in\nthis room, and me who am in it now. The telepathic impulse from\nhim will have been stored up, as it were, in the persistent and\nlocalised image which he originated and left behind him long ago,\nand the impulse only reaches me to-day when I come into the room.\nThis Une of reflection suggests another. The person who origi-\nnated the image may still be alive at the time when the apparition\n^ I say \" requisite minimum \" because we have evidence that the same\nghost may be perceived more clearly by some people and less clearly by others.\nBut cf. also pp. 339 et seq., below.\n\f160] Presidential Address 327\noccurs. (The theoretical possibility of \" haunting by the living\n\"\nseems to be actually confirmed in some of the records.) But it is\nusually found that he is dead, and even that he died many years\nbefore. Let us suppose that he is dead. Let us also suppose that\nthe haunting is of a fairly complex sort, though still without jjhysiccd\neffects. For instance, we will suppose that the phantasm is seen in\na number of different rooms in the house, and it is seen to move from\none room to another, so that the phenomena are \" cinematographic\n\"\nrather than just \" photographic \". Here then there is a group of\npersisting images, interrelated in a fairly complex way. Now since\nthe original author of these images is dead, Anti-Survivalists will of\ncourse wish to maintain that his mind has ceased to exist. But can\nthey quite maintain this, if our explanation of the phenomena is the\ncorrect one? For, to put it crudely, a bit of him does still survive,\neven though his body has long since disintegrated. This set of\ninterrelated images is something like a very rudimentary secondary\npersonality. It was split off from his main personality at the time\nwhen he lived in this room ; it escaped from his control and acquired\nan independent existence of its own. And it has succeeded in\n\" surviving \" the disintegration of his body, even if we say that his\nmain personality has not. To be sure, it need not survive for ever.\nEventually the images may lose theii' telepathic charge and fade\naway. The fact remains that it has succeeded in surviving for quite\na long period, possibly for many years. Of course it is very far\nfrom possessing all the attributes of a personality. To call it even\na secondary personality, even though the adjective \" rudimen-\ntary \" be added, is very likely an indefensible stretching of language.\nAll the same, it is an interrelated set of mental contents, endowed\n(if we are right) with a certain telepathic power. Moreover, it is a\n\" cinematographic \" phantasm which we are now considering\n:\nthere is the appearance of movement and of changes of posture. It\nis a series of visible or quasi-visible shapes. And in the manner in\nwhich the series is interrelated there may be, and there often is, the\nappearance of a rudimentary purpose. The complex of persisting\nimages is dominated as it were by a kind of idee fixe. If we did not\nknow that we were seeing a mere apparition, we should say \" here\nis a human being who is behaving in a curious somnambulistic way '\n'\n.\nThus, though it may be unjustifiable to call the set of persisting\nimages a rudimentary secondary personality, such language is not\nwithout excuse. Perhaps in the circumstances, the crudest ter-\nminology is the best. Let us repeat then that a\n'\"'\nbit \" of the\ndeceased personality has succeeded in surviving.\nBut once we admit this much, I think we have to go farther. If a\nC\n\f328 H. H. Price [part\nbit of his personality has managed to survive, if something which is\nat any rate quasi-mental has managed to carry on its existence for\nyears quite apart from a brain and nervous system, the survival\nof a complete personality is not impossible ; the antecedent im-\nprobability of a complete or integral survival is at any rate\ndiminished. This conclusion is a somewhat curious one. For the\nPsychometrical Theory of Haunting has seemed acceptable to many\npeople precisely because they thought it was an alternative to the\nSurvivalist explanation. And so in a way it is. But the alterna-\ntives are not to clear-cut as they look. In the first place, there is\nactually a Survivalist element in the Psychometrical explanation\nitself, as I have just shown. It is a question of Jiow much survival\nwe must postulate in order to explain the phenomena of Haunting ;\nwe have in any case to admit the survival of something, and of\nsomething quasi-mental. And secondly, as I have also shewn,\nthough the phenomena of Haunting do not in themselves require\nthe hypothesis of complete survival (since something very much less\nwill suffice to explain them), they do indirectly weaken the most\nimportant objection against that hypothesis, by shewing that\nsomething which is at least quasi-mental can exist in the absence of\na brain and nervous system.\nThe account which I have given of Haunting, in terms of persisting\nand telepathically-charged images, is exposed to certain difficulties,\nwhich I must now try to meet. Especially I have to make it\nconsistent with what was said earlier about the spatial properties\nof the Psychic Ether. I have of course maintained all along that\nthis Ether is an Ether of Images. But I suggested above that the\nEther of Images is not a single spatial continuum. An individual\nimage, I said, or again an individual image-field, does have spatial\nextension, and the notion of spatial location applies within it. But\nI also insisted that between one image-field and another there are no\nspatial relations in the ordinary sense, though there may be relations\nof telepathic affinity, and these may conceivably be arrangeable in\nan order having dimensions. But in the account which I have just\ngiven of Haunting, it is of course essential to maintain that an image\nor set of images can be quite literally localised in a certain region of\nPhysical Space, for example in a certain room. But if the Psychic\nEther as a whole is not a single spatial continuum, how can a part of\nit be located in Physical Space which is a single spatial continuum ?\nThere is a further difficulty which arises from the suggestion that\nHaunting is a sort of deferred Telepathy. For normal Telepathy\n\u2014including the sort which results in the production of a telepathic\n\f160] Presidential Address 329\nphantasm\u2014seems to be independent of the spatial position of the\npercipient's body. There may be a telepathic relation between\nA and B when their bodies are many hmidreds of miles apart ; and\nthere may be none\u2014or none that we know of\u2014when they are only\na yard from each other. But Haunting, whatever theory we may\nhold about it, seems to require a certain sort of spatial relation\nbetween the percipient's body and the haunted place or object\n:\nmoreover it must be a relation of spatial proximity. (Has a ghost\never been seen at even two hundred yards' distance? The usual\nrange seems to be only a few feet.)\nThere is, however, a normal and fairly familiar phenomenon\nwhich may help us here. It is possible to \" project \" a mental\nimage into space. Thus, with a certain effort, I can now project a\nvisual image of a black cat on to the carpet which I see before me.\nThe cat-like image is then located in my ordinary visual field. Much\nthe same can be done with auditory images. An auditory image\nresembling the sound of a gramophone can be projected into space,\nso that it is somewhat as if one were hearing a gramophone in the\nnext room. Some people will perhaps say that they cannot do these\nthings at all, and do not know what I am talking about ;\nothers, that\nthey can do them easily ; still others, including myself, that they\ncan do them occasionally and only with a special effort. I would\nsuggest, however, that this projecting of images is a process which\ncan and does go on in all of us automatically and perhaps frequently ;\nand that these differences between one person and another are only\ndifferences in the degree of consciousness which they have of it, and\nin the degree of voluntary control which they have acquired over it.\nI have already suggested that image-formatio?i is going on in all of\nus all the time, whether we are aware of it or not ; and the same\nmight be true of image-projection.\nWe may notice that the projection of images is in any case a very\npeculiar process, quite unlike anything which goes on in the Physical\nWorld ; and this despite the fact that the image is a spatial entity,\nhaving the properties of extension and shape. When the image is\n\" put \" into my visual field, it is not at all like putting a book on to\nthe table or \" projecting \" a tennis ball into the street. The image\ndoes not pass into my visual field from somewhere else, for it was not\nlocated anywhere to begin with ; nor does it pass through other\nplaces on the way. It simply changes instantaneously from a state\nof being extended but twdocated to a state of being extended and\nlocated. I know this sounds like nonsense. But I am simply\ntrying to describe a fairly familiar empirical fact. At least it is\nfamiliar to myself and to a number of other people. If there are\n\f330 H. H. Price [part\nany among you who do not know from personal experience what I\nam talking about, they must just take my description on trust\n;\nperhaps their faith may be strengthened by a consideration of the\nphenomena of Hallucination.\nNow we have been assuming\u2014this is the basis of the whole argu-\nment\u2014that images, once formed, can persist in being for a long\nperiod, independent of the will or knowledge of their author. If so,\nit is reasonable to suppose that once an image has been projected\ninto a certain region of space, it will remain there as long as it\ncontinues to exist. We should have to admit that the images which\nare responsible for haunting were probably projected unconsciously.\nBut I have already suggested that there is no difficulty in admitting\nthis. Thus even though the Ether of Images as a whole is not a\nsingle spatial continuum, it appears that a certain bit of it (a certain\nimage or group of images) can come to be as it were \" earth-bound\n\"\nand tied to a particular place in the Physical World, by means of\nthe mechanism of image-projection. And then any telepathic\ncharge which the image may have can only take effect from that\nparticular place as a centre ; so that in this special case, though not\nin others, a \" radiation theory \" of Telepathy might be feasible\u2014\na\npoint which I will consider later.\nI now turn to a second difficulty. The haunting apparition is\nnormally a more or less exact copy of the body of some person who\nformerly lived in the haunted place. That indeed is the point of the\npreposition \" of \" when we call it the ghost of Smith or whoever it\nmay be. (We ourselves have already compared it to a photograph\nor cinematographic picture.) But is this at all what we should have\nexpected if the ghost is a persistent and projected image originating\nin Smith's mind? Is it not most uncommon to form an image of\none's own body\u2014especially an accurate one? The puzzle is in-\ncreased by the fact that the image would have to represent the visible\nappearance of one's own body as seen from without. If the image\nwas formed and projected by Smith in some period of intense\nemotion, surely the last thing he would be thinking of at such a time\nwould be the outward aspect of his own body\u2014something which he\nhas only seen occasionally in a mirror ? Surely the ghost ought not\nto be the ghost \" of \" Smith himself : it ought to be the ghost \" of\n\"\nsome other person to whom his thoughts were turned at the time?\nThe difficulty is a serious one, and I think it applies not merely\nto my theory, but to any theory which tries to explain the pheno-\nmena of Haunting on \" psychometric \" lines. There seem to be two\nways of getting over it. First, it has been thought by some people\nthat there is such a thing as the mind of a place. They say it is a\n\f160] Presidential Address 331\nmistake to suppose that memory is exclusively a property of persons\nand animals. They suggest that walls also have memories (as they\nare said to have ears) ; or perhaps that a region of physical space, or\nsome extended something interpenetrating it, may retain a memory\nof events which have gone on in it. This reminds us of the old and\nqueer speculations concerning an Anima Mundi, or soul of the world ;\nonly that here it would be an anima loci, the soul of a place. I do\nnot myself think that it is necessary to have recourse to anything so\nstrange as this ; I hope to show presently that the difficulty can be\nmet in a less extravagant way. But in case I am wrong in thinking\nso, I should like to point out in passing that the hypothesis of an\nanima loci is not really quite so queer as it looks at first.\nAt least it begins to look much less queer if one adopts a certain\ntheory of sense-perception and of the constitution of the material\nworld. This theory, which I think is quite plausible on other\ngrounds, is the one put forward by Bertrand Russell in certain works\nof his middle period, notably Our Knowledge of the External World,\nMysticism and Logic, and The Analysis of Mind. According to it,\na piece of matter is not the relatively simple and tidy object which\nwe commonly think it to be, but is a vast and complex group of\nsensihilia. Sensibilia are such entities as colour-expanses, sounds,\ntactual pressures and the like. In fact they are just such entities\nas are called sense-data or sensa, only that they persist in being\nwhether anyone is sensing them or not ; and the sense-data actually\nsensed by human and other percipients are short temporal shces of\nsuch persisting sensibilia. This theory has never yet been worked\nout completely, and it is obviously exposed to serious objections\nfrom both the Physical and the Physiological side. I think myself\nthat these objections can probably be overcome by making the\ntheory slightly more complicated, but it would not be relevant to\ndiscuss the matter here. What concerns us now is the mode of\nspatial location which the sensibilia are said to have. Each of them\nis not only at a certain place but also from a certain other place, and\nuntil we have mentioned both places, we have not completely\nspecified the sensibile's location. Thus a certain mountain, say\nSkiddaw in Cumberland, is a vast and complex assemblage of\n\" views \" which go on existing whether or not anybody is viewing\nthem. One of them will be a view of Skiddaw from the top of\nHelvellyn, another will be a view of it from Keswick railway station,\nothers will be from various points in Derwentwater, and so on. And\nwhen we say that they are views \" of \" it, each existing from its\nproper place, we mean that they are members of the group which\ncollectively is Skiddaw.\n\f332 H. H. Price [part\nNow this theory may well be combined (as Lord Russell has in\nfact combined it) with another theory which philosophers call\nNeutral Monism.^ According to this, both mind and matter are\ncomposed of the same constituents. Such entities as colour-expanses,\nsounds and the like are not merely objects of a mind's awareness,\nbut actually constituents of that mind. If they are also constituents\nof the material world, as the previous theory says they are, then\nmind and matter overlap, and any case of sense-perception is a case\nof such overlapping. We can now return to the hypothesis of an\nannua loci. Consider any place P, say the middle ofa certain drawing-\nroom. Since colour-expanses and other sensibilia are continuously\nexisting from the place, whether or not any percipient organism\noccupies it, we can regard these sensibilia as forming a group\u2014\na\ngroup united by the fact that all the members exist from the same\nplace P. And if the Neutral Monist theory of mind be adopted, we\ncould regard this group of colour expanses existing from P as con-\nstituting a kind of rudimentary mind, the \" mind of\" place P, an\nanima loci. To be sure, we must now take a further and even more\ndubious step if we are to get the particular sort of anima loci we\nwant. We shall have to endow it with a rudimentary memory as\nwell. We shall have to say that when there are sensibilia existing\nfrom a place, then memory-images also come into being which exist\nfrom (or at?) that place, and which are more or less accurate repro-\nductions of these sensibiUa. These images, we shall have to suppose,\nremain there permanently, and collectively constitute \" the memory\nof the place \". This is certainly a rather extravagant suggestion.\nWe ordinarily think that memory-images can only be generated in\nconnection with some sort of brain or nervous system ; and we are\nstill disposed to stick to this view about their origin, even if we\nsuppose\u2014as I have been doing\u2014that they acquire a more or less\ncomplete independence afterwards. But of course many people also\nthink that such entities as colour-expanses only exist in connection\nwith a brain or nervous system. This is the familiar assumption of\nthe psycho-physiological \" subjectivity \" of sensible qualities, an\nassumption which was taken over from the Cartesian philosophy of\nthe seventeenth century, and has been part of Orthodox Science ever\n^ Cf. Russell, The Analysis of Mind, passim. The theory of Neutral Monism\nwas first worked out by Ernst Mach in his Analyse der Empfindungen (an\nEnglish translation has been published by the Open Court Company under the\ntitle The Analysis of Sensations). But the theory had already been suggested\nby Hume in his Treatise of Human Nature (p. 207 in Selby-Bigge's edition) and\nin Berkeley's Commonplace Book, though not in his published works. If I am\nnot mistaken, there are also traces of the theory in some forms of Buddhist\nmetaphysics.\n\f160] Presidential Address 333\nsince. If once we reject this assumption and say that such entities\nas colour-expanses are actually constituents of the Physical World,\nperhaps it is less difficult to say something similar about memory-\nimages, and to hold that they come into being automatically at any\nplace from which sensibilia exist, whether a nervous system occupies\nthat place or not.\nSo much then by way of showing that the notion of an anima loci\nor place-mernory, fantastic though it be, is not quite so fantastic as\nit seems at first sight. If a place can retain memory-images of the\nviews which formerly existed from that place, and if some of these\nwere views of Smith's body from without, and if these memory-\nimages are what we perceive now when we see Smith's ghost : then\nit is very natural that the ghost resembles Smith's body as it would\nappear to an external observer.\nHowever, I do not think that we are compelled to accept this queer\ntheory. The difficulty which led us to discuss it can be solved in\nanother and simpler way. The difficulty, it will be recalled, was\nthis : if the external source which causes us to see the apparition is\nan image which originated in the mind of Smith himself, why should\nthe apparition resemble Smith's own body as it woiild appear from\nwithout? Indeed why should it resemble his own body at all? Now\nfortunately there is an analogy which we may appeal to, which at\nleast shows that the thing can happen. I refer to the classical tele-\npathic phantasm. This seems to represent the agent's body as he\nhabitually thinks of it, and clothed in the clothes which he thinks of\nhimself as wearing (there is the well-known case of a telepathic\nphantasm with a patch in the skirt). Sometimes there are additional\nelements represented, as wounds or injuries, and sometimes the\nphantasm appears dripping wet. These again are features which the\nagent would think of as characterising his body at the moment,\nthough again he would not have seen them as they would look from\nwithout. These considerations suggest that a mind can form an\nimage of its own body as it woidd appear from without. Presumably\nsuch an image would be formed unconsciously, in accordance with\none's likewise unconscious beliefs about the visible characteristics\nof one's own body. If this is indeed so, there is no reason why Smith\nshould not unconsciously \"project an image of his own body into the\nspace of the room in which he is ; and this image, according to our\nprevious argument, will then persist there, to become in due course\nthe ghost \" of \" Smith. Perhaps such images of one's own body are\nmore liable to be formed and projected in periods of strong emotion.\nOr perhaps they are formed and projected constantly (though\nunconsciously) but in moments of intense emotion they may have a\n\f334 H. H. Price [part\nstronger telepathic charge, or a greater power of persistence, or\nboth.\nSo far we have considered the phenomena of Haunting from the\nside of the object perceived. (The sense in which I am using the\nword \" perceive \" has been explained on p. 326 above). This object,\nwe suggest, is an image or set of images originating in the mind of\nsomeone who formerly lived in the place ;\nprojected by him into\nspace, probably unconsciously ; endowed with a certain telepathic\ncharge, deriving perhaps from the emotions he felt at the time ; and\npersisting in that place thereafter, independent of the mind or will\nof the original author. But we have still to consider the situation\nfrom the other side, the side of the percipient who \" sees \" the\napparition ; and we have to try to understand, as far as we can, the\nprocess by which the seeing comes about.\nThis process can hardly be analogous to the physical and physio-\nlogical processes which underly our normal visual experience. The\nghost which I see may be in the middle of a room which I also see ;\nbut the two seeings must be caused in different ways, even though\nthe final results of the two causal processes are similar. For on any\ntheory, and whatever the external factor in ghost-seeing may be, it\ncan hardly be something which emits or reflects ordinary light-rays.\nOtherwise it would be an ordinary physical object, whose presence\ncould be detected by the ordinary methods of Physical Science.\nMoreover, it would not then have the restricted publicity which\nghosts do have, but the unrestricted publicity of an ordinary physical\nobject, and it would have to be tangible as well as visible. Could it\nthen be analogous to a rainbow or mirage, which is visible but not\ntangible? No, for even so its publicity would not be sufliciently\nrestricted. Anyone with normal eyesight would then be able to see\nit, provided he stood in the right place ; and this is not found to\nhappen. And of course if the external factor in ghost-seeing is what\nI myself have said it is, namely a persistent and localised mental\nimage, it certainly cannot emit or reflect light-rays, even though it is\nlocated in the space of the physical world ; it is in the physical\nworld, but not of it. We have accordingly suggested that the process\nwhich enables us to perceive it is not physical but telepathic\u2014a kind\nof deferred Telepathy.\nBut if it is telepathic, there is a serious difl&culty to be faced. For\nit appears that this telepathic process, unlike all others, must be\nsubject to spatial limitations. If it were a case of ordinary Tele-\npathy, ought I not to see the ghost equally well whether I am here,\nor in the next street, or in America, provided that I have the right\n\f160] Presidential Address 335\nsort of telepathic receptiveness ? But actually of course I shall only\nsee it if I am physically present in the haunted room. Shall we then\nbe driven to say that in this type of case, though in no others, a\n\" radiation theory \" of Telepathy is correct? Shall we say that the\npersistent and localised image emits a radiation of a sort unknown to\nPhysical Science, and that this affects the brain and consequently\nthe mind of the percipient ? I do not think we cotdd hold in any case\nthat the radiation affects his eyes. For, if so, it ought to be subject\nto the same kind of laws as ordinary light : and the shape, size and\nposition of the apparition ought to be altered by the interposition\nof lenses, prisms or mirrors, which does not apparently happen.\nAVe have to remember too that sometimes the ghost is only \" seen\n\"\nin a dream, when the percipient's eyes are shut ; and sometimes he\ndoes not see it at all, and yet he may still experience a vivid \" sense\nof presence Thus I think we should have to say that these radia-\ntions, if such there be, affect the central nervous system directly ;\nnot indirectly, by way of a peripheral sense-organ, as light-rays or\nheat-radiations do. Perhaps this is what happens. But if we are\ninclined to accept this account of the matter, we must face the con-\nsequences. The central nervous system is nothing but a physical\nobject of a very complex sort ; and any radiations which can cause\nchanges in it must surely be physical radiations, detectable by the\nmethods of Physical Science (even if not yet detected) and able to be\ndiverted or modified by purely physical means. Moreover, if I may\nrepeat it again, the entity which emits them must then itself be a\nphysical entity, and must itself be detectable by these same methods :\nfor example, by electrical methods of some very refined sort. Are\nwe prepared to accept these consequences? We certainly cannot say\nthat at present there is any empirical evidence for their truth : and\nif they are false, the radiation hypothesis must also be false.\nI think then that although the process which results in the seeing\nof a ghost is undoubtedly spatial in some sense\u2014as the very meaning\nof the word \" haunting \" implies\u2014yet it is not helpful to conceive\nof it as any sort of radiation, at least in our present state of ignorance.\nAnd if it be a telepathic process, we have got to account somehow\nfor the spatial limitations to which it is subject. Can we find any\nother way of accounting for them, once the radiation theory is\nrejected? The answer I am going to offer is perhaps the most\nunplausible of all the unplausible things I have suggested in the\ncourse of this address ;\nyou may think that in putting it forward I\nam surrendering to the wildest superstitions of the Occultists.\nI want to suggest that there may be some truth in the theory of an\n\" aura \" or \" psychic atmosphere \" surrounding the body of a living\n\f336 H. H. Price [part\nperson. This theory, if you like, is just another application of the\nPsychic Ether hypothesis which is the main theme of this address.\nFor this psychic atmosphere would have some of the properties of\nmatter (namely spatial extension and location in Physical Space)\nand some of the properties of mind. It would be a portion of this\nPsychic Ether localised in and around a certain place, the place\nwhere a living human body now is ;\njust as a ghost is a portion of\nthis same Psychic Ether localised in a place where a living human\nbeing formerly was. And I suggest, though I do not quite know the\nmeaning of what I say, that the \"stuff\" of which this psychic\natmosphere is composed is the same as the \" stuff \" of which images\nare composed. I will even say, if you prefer, that it actually consists\nof a vast mass of unconsciously and automatically projected images\n\u2014images which form the habitual mental content of the person in\nquestion\u2014all mixed up together, and having so to say a certain\n\" mass-effect \" characteristic of that particular person. I think this\nsuggestion, peculiar as it may seem, will fulfil our requirements in a\nway in which the Radiation Theory would not. The psychic atmos-\nphere surrounding the percipient is spatial in quite a literal sense.\nYet it is not physical, as his nervous system is. and no physical\ninstrument could detect its presence.\nWe may then proceed to suppose that the thing which the ghost-\nimage primarily affects (by means of the telepathic charge inherent\nin it) is not the percipient's central nervous system, and still less his\neyes or other peripheral sense-organs, but rather this psychic\natmosphere which surrounds and perhaps interpenetrates his body.\nThis does at least enable us to say that the two terms involved in the\ntransaction are in pari materia ;\nfor the one is a mental image, and\nthe other is either an assemblage of images or is at least composed\nof \" imagy \" stuff. We do not have to hold that the one term (the\nghost-image) is non-physical and the other physical, as we should if\nwe said that the recipient of the telepathic transmission is the central\nnervous system. Nor do we have to hold that the one is spatial and\nthe other non-spatial, as we should if we supposed that the recipient\nis the knowing subject or Pure Ego, which is not literally in space at\nall. Both terms\u2014the persisting and localised image on the one side,\nthe percipient's psychic atmosphere on the other\u2014are alike in being\nspatial, yet neither is physical. Thus it is at any rate somewhat\neasier to conceive of a direct causal transaction between them.\nBefore going farther, we must turn aside to consider another\ndifficulty which is at first sight entirely different from the one which\nconcerns us at present. But I think we shall find in the end that it\nwill help us to form some notion of the causal process by which\n\f160] Presidential Address 337\nghost-seeing is conditioned. It is a difficulty which applies to any\ntheory of Haunting. It is this. Why is it that so few places are\nhaunted? If the haunting of a house (anyhow the type of haunting\nwhich we are discussing) is ultimately caused by the emotions or\nother experiences of persons who formerly lived there, surely any\nhouse which has been inhabited for twenty or thirty years ought to\nbe haunted, and indeed haunted by a number of different ghosts?\nIn a town of any age, almost every street corner ought to be packed\nwith apparitions. Even a new house ought soon to be haunted by\nghosts of its still-living inhabitants. (As we have seen already,\n\" haunting by the living \" is not unknown. But why is it not a great\ndeal more frequent?)\nYou may reply perhaps that it is not enough that Smith should\nhave lived in the house, nor even that he should have had emotions\nof certain sorts there ; what is required is that he should have had\nemotions of very great intensity, and these after all are not so very\ncommon. Even so, in any house which has been inhabited for a\ncentury\u2014no great age for a house\u2014such intense emotions must\nsurely have occurred quite a niuxiber of times. Births, deaths,\nserious illnesses, accidents, are bound to have occurred in the house-\nhold. And what about prisons and law courts, or places where\nreligious manifestations of the more extreme kind have been\nsystematically promoted? What about railway stations? Arrivals\nand departures often cause extremely strong emotions. So even if\nwe say that great intensity of emotion is a necessary condition of\nhaunting, even so it would seem that there ought to be a great deal\nmore haunting than there actually is. It is of course true that a\nspecial type of percipient is required. It is not everyone who can see\na ghost, even granting that the requisite conditions are present on\nthe objective side. But even so, such percipients do exist. Should\nwe not expect them to see vastly more ghosts than they do see ? For\nthe objective conditions, it would seem, must be fulfilled in a very large\nnumber of cases.\nThe solution I would myself suggest is this. I think we should\nboldly agree that, so far as the objective conditions go, every place\nwhich has been inhabited for any length of time is haunted by a\nlarge number of ghosts. The trouble is, I suggest, that as a rule it is\nhaunted by too many, so that their effects obliterate each other. I\nwill explain myself. In any long-inhabited place there will be quite\na large number of persistent and locahsed images, imconsciously pro-\nduced and projected by the minds of those who have inhabited it.\nI suggested just now that the \" psychic atmosphere \" surrounding a\nperson might be a kind of mass-effect due to a large number of\n\f338 H. H. Price [part\ndifferent images which he unconsciously projects. Perhaps in the\nsame sort of way every room which has been inhabited for some time\nhas its psychic atmosphere, and likewise every law court and railway\nstation. This psychic atmosphere of the room will be a kind of\nblending of all the persistent images which have been unconsciously\nprojected into it from time to time. These different images will have\ndifferent telepathic charges\u2014corresponding to differences of type\nand intensity between the emotions with which they were originally\nassociated. The result will be a kind of confused amalgam of the\nwhole lot. Consequently, the percipient, even though he has all the\nrequisite subjective qualifications for ghost-seeing, will only be able\nto say that the room has a characteristic \" feel \" about it ; he will\nnot be able to see anything. It might even be that the telepathic\ncharges of the different images cancel each other out, so that nothing\nis either felt or seen.\nI am much inclined to think that the same kind of thing may\nhappen in ordinary Telepathy : that telepathic \" impulses \" in\ngreat numbers are continually reaching everyone, but that normally\nthey inhibit each other, just because they are so numerous and so\ndiverse. If so, the reason why most of us appear to receive no tele-\npathic impressions is that we receive too many, so that no one of\nthem makes any distinct or individual mark upon our minds. If\nthis parallel is not acceptable, I will appeal to a frankly materialistic\nanalogy, drawn from the more familiar world of the Detective Story.\nWhen a certain object, say a poker, has been handled by a great\nnumber of people, it will be useless to look for thumb-prints on it\n:\nnot because there are none, but because there are too many, and\nthey are all blended together into an undififerentiable mess. So it\nmay be with the persisting images which previous occupants of a\nroom have left behind them. Just because they are so numerous\nand so different, no one of them makes any individual impression\nupon the mind of the percipient. The place is so much haunted\nthat it seems not to be haunted at all.\nWe can now turn back to our previous question concerning the\ncausal process which results in ghost-seeing. I suggest that the\nfirst thing required is the overlapping or interpenetration ^ of two\n\" psychic atmospheres \", the one which surrounds the percipient's\n^ We have no reason to suppose that images are impenetrable to other\nimages, as material particles are impenetrable to other material particles.\nSo far as we can tell, two localised images could be in the same place in Physical\nSpace. However, if images are mutually impenetrable, the process which\nI have called interpenetration ought rather to be described as a blending or\nmixture, analogous to the blending of two liquids or gases.\n\f160] Presidential Address 339\nbody and the one which pervades the room. This interpenetration\nof the two psychic atmospheres will be the spatial condition which\nhas to be fulfilled if the ghost is to be seen. This is the substitute\nwhich I would offer for the Radiation Theory discussed and criticised\nabove. For we may suppose that this interpenetration will cause\nchanges in the psychic atmosphere of the percipient. Ex hypothesi\na man's psychic atmosphere is affected by processes in his mind. I\nnow want to suggest that the causal relation between them may be\ntwo-way, so that his mind is in turn affected by changes in his\npsychic atmosphere, which after all consists of mental contents\nbelonging to him ; for images, though projected into space, are still\nmental entities. If this be granted, a man's psychic atmosphere will\nbe a kind of secondary body, related to his mind in the same kind of\nway as the ordinary physical body is, though perhaps more inti-\nmately. (The notion of a \" spiritual body \" additional to the\n\" physical body \"'\nis of course an old and familiar one ; what is new\nis only the suggestion that it is composed of unconsciously projected\nimages, or at any rate of image-like stuff.)\nBut obviously this spatial interpenetration of two psychic atmos-\npheres\u2014the percipient's and the room's\u2014is not a sufficient condi-\ntion of ghost-seeing, but only a necessary (indispensable) condition.\nAs I have already said, I think that a telepathic process is also\nrequired. I have suggested that every persistent and localised image\nhas a telepathic charge. We may further suppose that telepathic\ncharges can differ in at least two distinct ways : in quality and\nintensity. We will next re-introduce the notion of telepathic affinity\nwhich was mentioned some time ago. This, it will be remembered,\nwas a relation between two psychical contents which makes it\npossible for the one to have a telepathic effect upon the other.\nNow the localised and persistent image, which is the external or\nobjective factor in Haunting, may have a greater or lesser degree of\ntelepathic affinity with the contents of the percipient's psychic\natmosphere, or perhaps even none at all ; whether it has much, or\nlittle, or none will depend on the quality of the telepathic charge\ninherent in it. If the affinity is slight or non-existent, nothing will\nhappen, even though the spatial conditions for ghost-seeing are\ncompletely fulfilled. And even though the telepathic affinity is\ngreat, still nothing will happen if the intensity of the telepathic\ncharge is too low. But let us suppose that the affinity is great and\nthe telepathic charge very strong. Then the localised image will\nhave a telepathic effect upon the percipient's psychic atmosphere,\nand that again upon his mind. In consequence, he will j^roduce and\nproject a phantasm. And if this phantasm corresponds pretty\nT\n\f340 H. H. Price [part\nclosely in shape, size and location to the persistent image which\nstarted the process, then we may say that he is \" perceiving \" the\npersistent image itself. (How shall we discover whether the phan-\ntasm 'c^oes correspond to the persistent image? We discover this\nindirectly, by finding out whether it has a sufficiently close resem-\nblance to the body of some former inhabitant of the room.) Thus\nthe final stage of the process will be the same as it is in the case of\nthe classical telepathic phantasm. The difference will be in the\nearlier stages. For the occurrence of the classical telepathic phan-\ntasm is not dependent upon any particular spatial relation between\nthe agent and the percipient. Moreover, in haunting the immediate\nagent is not a mind, but only an image : though the ultimate agent\nis the mind which originated and projected the image long ago. So\nit is a case of deferred telepathy, resulting in the production of a\n\" post-dated \" telepathic phantasm. I have indeed myself suggested\nthat in all telepathy, of whatever sort, the immediate and primary\nsource of the telepathic impulse is a psychical content rather than a\nmind. Even so, the difference between Haunting and Classical\nTelepathy still remains. For in Classical Telepathy the telepathi-\ncally-active psychical content is actually contained in a complete\nand living personality ; whereas in Haunting it has long since got\ndissociated from the mind which originally owned it, and indeed that\nmind (if the Anti-Survivalists are right) may long ago have ceased to\nexist.\nWe were asking a few pages back why ghost-seeing is a com-\nparatively rare occurrence. We can now add something to our\nanswer. The reason we gave Avas that most places are haunted too\nmuch and as it were too promiscuously. If an apparition is to be\nseen, there must be a certain constituent in the psychical atmosphere\nof the room which stands out, so to speak, from the rest. We can\nnow see that it must stand out in two different ways, both in respect\nof quality and in respect of intensity. To use the same sort of analogy\nas before : if a lot of signatures were written all over a small piece\nof paper, one on top of the other, you could not read any of them.\nYou would see only a confused l)lur. But if one were written in red\nink and all the rest in black, you might be able to read the red one\nquite well. And you would be more likely to do so if the ink\nin which it was written had been particularly strong and lastiug.\nEven so, you would not succeed if you happened to be colour-\nblind.\nIt may, however, be that great intensity in the telepathic charge\ncan compensate for otherwise unsuitable quality. Conversely, if the\nquality is exactly right (if there is the maximum degree of telepathic\n\f160] Presidential Address 341\naffinity between the persisting image and the mental contents of the\npercipient) this may compensate for feeble intensity. In terms of\nom\" analogy : one might still be able to pick out the red signature\nfrom the confused black ones, even if it had faded ; and even if a\nman was colour-blind he might still be able to pick out one which\nwas written in much brighter and fresher ink than the rest. These\nconditions as to quality and intensity are perhaps not likely to be\nfulfilled so very frequently. And this may incidentally account also\nfor the many instances in which a man sees just one ghost in his life,\nwithout giving any other evidence of supernormal powers, telepathic\nor otherwise.\nI must now bring my remarks to a close. I am well aware that the\ntheory of Haunting which I have sketched is full of loose ends.\nFor one thing, it is much too narrow, in that I have spoken as if\nimages were the only important sort of psychical contents, which is\nfar from being true. Again, the theory has in any case been restricted\nto one special type of Haunting, the type in which there are no\nphysical effects ; it could only be extended to cover other types by\nintroducing additional assumptions, which might have to be very\noutrageous. Worst of all, my whole explanation may be sheer\nnonsense from start to finish. Certainly I tremble to think what a\nhash might be made of it by an even moderately competent second-\nyear student of Philosophy. And yet the initial step, upon which\neverything depends, the suggestion that mental images may persist\nin being apart from the mind of their author, is not so utterly extra-\nvagant, but only unfamiliar. The current view, that they exist only\nso long as the act of \" imaging \" goes on. has been simply taken for\ngranted without any solid argument. And once this initial step is\ntaken, the additional assumptions I have made are, I do not say\neasy, but at any rate not so very difficult.\nHowever this may be, the risk of nonsense has got to be taken.\nUnless we are prepared to take it, our subject will never advance\nout of the fact-collecting stage into the maturity of a genuine\nscience. For, as I have pointed out already, the phenomena which\nconcern us are so unlike those which ordinary language is designed\nto describe, that the right theory of them, when found, is bound to\nseem nonsensical at first. We may safely predict that it will be the\ntimidity of our hypotheses, and not their extravagance, which will\nprovoke the derision of posterity.\n\f342 \/\/. H. Price [pabt\nApj)endix\nThere are two rather curious questions which are worth men-\ntioning, though they He somewhat outside the hne of my main\nargument.\n1. According to the \" psychic atmosphere \" theory sketched\nabove, one would expect that persons would sometimes be haunted\nas well as places. For the psychic atmosphere of a person, like that\nof a place, consists of a mass of projected images, and they will\npresumably be telepathically charged. We should expect that\nsometimes some one of them would stand out from the rest in respect\nof its quality and intensity, especially if it is connected with some\nstrong and prolonged emotion. In that case it ought to be per-\nceptible to a suitably-qualified percipient. I thinlc there is evidence\nthat this does sometimes happen, though I do not know how good\nthe evidence is.\n2. Does anyone ever see the ghost of himself1 When a man\ncomes into a room which he has inhabited for years, ought he not\nsometimes to see an apparition of himself, sitting in his favourite\nchair? Haunting by the living is not maknown, as we have seen.\nOne would almost think that \" self-haimting \" would be the most\ncommon case of it, and indeed that it ought to be quite frequent.\nThe best condition would be that in which the percipient is the sole\ninhabitant of the room and it has never previously been occupied by\nanyone else. Perhaps this does not happen so very often ; even so,\nit must happen sometimes. , .:\nIf, however, self-haunting never occurs,^ this is a serious difficulty\nfor my theory. Surely an image projected by myself would have the\nmaximum degree of telepathic affinity with my present mental con-\ntents ? It would seem then it ought to cause me to see an apparition,\neven if it has no effect on anyone else.\nThe only solution I can suggest is that the telepathic affinity may\nbe too perfect. Perhaps telepathy only occurs when there is some\ndegree of shock or intrusion. Perhaps a telepathic charge behaves\nlike an electric charge. If two neighbouring bodies have exactly\nthe same electric charge, there is no electrical discharge from the one\nto the other. .. :\nEven so, we should expect that when an adult man revisits the\nhome of his childhood, he would sometimes see the ghost of himself\nas he formerly was, even though he never sees the ghost of himself\n^ Signor Bozzano [Phenomenes de Hantise, p. 184) says that it did once occur\nto Guy de Maui^assant. \" En rentrant chez lui il se voyait assis dans son\nfauteuil.\" The authority for the story is said to be Paul Bourget, but un-\nfortunately Signor Bozzano does not give the reference.\n\f160] Presidential Address 343\nas he now is ; for his childish emotions were presumably different\nfrom his present ones, and so the images which he then projected\nwould have a different telepathic charge from the images which\nmake up his psychic atmosphere now. Or shall we reply, talcing a\nhint from the Psycho-analysts, that he still retains his childish\nemotions to tHs day, in undiminished strength, though they are now\nrepressed into the Unconscious?\n\f344 Professor Sigmund Freud [part\nOBITUAEY\nProfessor Sigmund Freud\nProfessor Sigmund Freud died in London on September 23, 1939,\nat the age of 83, after a long and painful illness. He was born in\nMoravia in 1856, but from the age of four he lived in Vienna until\n1938, when, after the annexation of Austria by Germany, he found\nrefuge in England. He studied medicine in Vienna and at first his\ninterests lay in the field of cerebral anatomy and physiology. The\nvarious branches of medicine proper, apart from psychiatry, had no\nattraction for him and after a short period of study under Charcot\nin Paris, he settled down in 1886 as a specialist in nervous disorders.\nAbandoning the treatment of organic nervous diseases he confined\nhis work to the treatment of the neuroses. At first his principal\ninstrument of work, apart from haphazard and unsystematic\npsycho-therapeutic methods, was hypnotic suggestion. From the\nfirst he used hypnotism not only as a means of giving therapeutic\nsuggestions but also for questioning the patient about the origin\nof his symptoms. The value of this procedure he had learnt from\nDr Josef Breuer, a Viennese physician, and its further extension by\nFreud led in the end to the development of the methods of Psycho-\nanalysis in which hypnotism is not used.\nThe momentous nature of Freud's discoveries might have been\nsuspected from the storm of op|)osition and obloquy which they\nencountered on first being disclosed ; and nothing in Freud's life-\nhistory is more impressive than the courage and persistence with\nwhich he devoted himself to work which was not only unappreciated\nby his fellow physicians but was derided by the greater part of the\nworld. Only after more than ten years of solitary work did his\nteaching begin to get a hearing among psychologists. Then gradu-\nally a small band of pupils from other countries, attracted by his\nteaching, gathered around him in Vienna and in time helped to\nspread a knowledge of his doctrines throughout the world.\n\f160] Obituary 345\nThe first noticeable recognition of Freud's work by academic\npsychology was an invitation from Professor Stanley Hall to deliver\na course of lectures on Psycho-analysis at Clark University in the\nUnited States. Freud was greatly heartened by his reception in\nAmerica. \" In Europe,\" he said, \" I felt as though I were desj^ised ;\nbut over there I found myself received by the foremost men as an\nequal.\"\nInterest in psycho-analysis was greatly stimulated by the AVar of\n1914-1918, for during its course psychologists and medical men were\nforced to admit the part played by mental factors in the production\nand treatment of war neuroses. Since those days acknowledg-\nment and understanding of Freud's work have steadily increased and\nat the present time it is recognized throughout the world as the most\nimportant contribution to psychology and to therapeutics that has\never been made by one man. And it is not only in these two spheres\nthat its effects are seen. There is no department of knowledge\nrelated to man's life and behaviour that has not been influenced by\nFreud's teaching.\nFreud was a corresponding member of our Society and contributed\nto Proceedings a paper entitled a \" Note on the Unconscious in\nPsycho-analysis \". It w^as indeed in his prolonged researches on the\nunconscious that his work approached most closely to the interests\nof Psychical Research. He was at all times sceptical of alleged\nsupernormal phenomena but he appeared to have an open mind on\nthe possibility of the occurrence of telepathy. At the end of a paper\non ' Dreams and Telepathy \" written in 1922, he said : Have I\ngiven you the impression that I am secretly inclined to suj^port the\nreality of telepathy in the occult sense? If so, I should very much\nregret that it is so difficult to avoid giving such an impression. In\nreality, however, I was anxious to be strictly impartial, I have every\nreason to be so, for I have no opinion ; I know nothing about it.\"\nSuch a statement is entirely in keeping with Freud's attitude\ntowards all judgments of belief or mibelief. Some of his own\ndiscoveries were at first sight as unbelievable as those of psychical\nresearch and the advice he gave to the detractors of Psycho-analysis\nis equally applicable to the critics of Psychical Research :\n\" If\nowing to ignorance of the subject you are not in a position to adjudi-\ncate, then you should neither believe nor reject ... no one has a right\nto conviction on these matters who has not worked at the subject\nfor many years, as I have, and has not himself experienced the same\nnew and astonishing discoveries.\"\nThose who knew Professor Freud best are at one in their judgment\nthat he was not only a great psychologist but also that he was a\n\f346 Professor Sigmund Freud [part\ngreat man.

W. M.\n\f160J Review 347\nREVIEW\nSiGMUND Freud. Moses and Monotheism translated from the\nGerman by Katherine Jones. The Hogarth Press. Pp. 223.\nPrice 8s. 6d.\nHistorical research has traced the origin of monotheism to Egypt,\nand according to Freud the monotheism of the Jews was but a\ncontinuation and development of the beliefs of the worshippers of\nthe Sun God Aton during the reign of the Pharaoh Ikhnaton of the\nEighteenth Dynasty : Moses was an Egyptian, probably of high\nrank, and an enthusiastic adherent of the Aton religion in which the\nsun was worshipped not as a material object but as a symbol of a\nDivine Being whose energy was manifested in his rays. When\nIkhnaton died the Aton reUgion was abolished and Moses attached\nhimself to the Israelites settled in Egypt, became their leader and\nconverted them to the religion of his teacher Ikhnaton. He led the\nIsraelites out of Egypt and for a time they accepted his teaching,\nbut when they found the hardships of the Exodus more than they\ncould bear they rebelled against him, murdered him and relapsed\ninto idolatry.\nThe murder of Moses by the rebellious Israelites is the central\npoint in Freud's theory of the revival and final victory of mono-\ntheism in Jewish religion. In this book he applies the views on the\norigin of religion which he had put forward a quarter of a century\nago in his book Totem and Taboo. Totemism, in which Freud finds\nthe beginnings of all religion, arose in prehistoric times after the\nmurder of the \" primaeval father \" by the sons of the \" father-\nhorde \". The sons loved the father, but they also hated him. They\nwere jealous of his jjower and his possession of all the desired things\nof life ; so they banded together and killed him. After his death\nthe sons suffered remorse, and the love and reverence towards the\nfather was displaced on to the totem animal which was treated as a\nfather-substitute. The hate towards the father fomid vent in the\ntotem feast in which the totem animal was killed and eaten.\nThis crime, the murder of the primaeval father, has lain heavy on\nhumanity ; it is the \" original sin \" of mankind. Every god that\n\f348 Review [part\nman has worshipped has been a personification of some aspect of the\nfatlier, every act of worship has been a plea for condonation of the\nsin and an appeal for the continued love and protection of the\nall-powerful father. Man's need for God arises when he feels his\nhelplessness against the forces of nature that threaten his existence\nand cause him anxiety. His ideas of God are based upon his child-\nhood experience of his father\u2014one who was powerful to protect him\nfrom danger and to whom he could turn in time of trouble. And\njust as in childhood he turned to his earthly father for protection,\nso, when grown up, he turns to his heavenly father when no earthly\nhelp can be found.\nThe murder of Moses by the Israelites was a repetition of the\nmurder of the primaeval father, and stirred up and intensified the\nfeeling of guilt associated with the original sin ; and although the\nIsraelites for a time tried to gain reassurance by straying after\nstrange gods, in the end they came back to the one and only God\nwhom Moses had taught them to worship.\nThe influence of events of early childhood on later life is one of\nthe cardinal tenets of Freud's teaching, and he applies to the life\nof the race the same principle which he found to be so important\nin the individual life. In the life of the individual such influence\nis most strikingly shown in the development of the neuroses. Some\npainful experience in childhood is repressed and forgotten ; after\na period of latency it may, for one reason or another, get stirred\nup again and give rise to mental conflict ; in the end it forces its\nway into consciousness in a distorted form as a neurotic symptom.\nPainful experiences in the life of the race are also forgotten and\nafter, it may be, centuries of latency may give rise to racial symp-\ntoms. According to Freud the rise and development of religion is\nsuch a symptom which has its roots in the murder of the primaeval\nfather and his later representatives. But while we may speak of\nthe memory of events in the individual life being repressed in the\nunconscious, it is not easy to conceive of a racial unconscious in\nwhich the memories of repressed racial experience are conserved.\nThe possibility of something of this kind that would account for\nwhat appear to be racial memories has been suggested many times\nin Freud's writings and he considers the evidence on which his con-\nclusions are based so strong that he now ventures to assert that\n\" the archaic heritage of mankind includes not only dispositions,\nbut also ideational contents, memory-traces of the experiences of\nformer generations \".\nIn advocating this doctrine Freud is well aware that he is, as often\nbefore, in opposition to orthodox opinion. He is accepting the trans-\n\f160] Review 349\nniissibility of acquired characters and the existence in the indi^ddual\nof innate ideas.\n\" Though we may admit \", he says, that for the memory-traces\nin our archaic inheritance ^Ye have so far no stronger proof than\nthose remnants of memory evoked by analytic work, which call for\na derivation from phylogenesis, yet this proof seems to me con-\n\\dncing enough to postulate such a state of affairs. ... It is bold,\nbut inevitable.\"\nIf we accept this view it may be found to have an unsuspected\nbearing on some of the problems of Psychical Research. For not\nonly would our archaic inheritance provide memory-traces of racial\nexperience but it might also account for the occasional manifesta-\ntion by hirnian beings of what appear to be supernormal powers. It\nhas sometimes been suggested that what appears to be supernormal\nfaculty in man is often analogous to some of the normal capacities\nof the lower animals which have in the course of evolution been lost\nto the human race. For example, many careful observers of animal\nlife have expressed the belief that there is telepathic communica-\ntion between members of the same species, that their instinctive\nactivities sometimes appear to be guided by foreknowledge, and\nthat the acuteness of some of their special senses is comparable to\nthe hyperacuity displayed by human beings in certain trance states.\nIndeed the ability or tendency to go into trance may be derived\nfrom the same source. A scientific friend of Freud assured him\n\" that the Yogi by their practices of withdrawal from the world,\nconcentrating attention on bodily functions, peculiar methods of\nbreathing, actually are able to produce new sensations and diffused\nfeelings in themselves which he regards as regression to primordial,\ndeeply buried mental states \". Freud connnents :\n\" There would\nbe connections to be made here with many obscm\"e modifications\nof mental life such as trance and ecstasy.\"\nAlthough behef in archaic inheritance such as Freud postulates\nis requisite for a full appreciation of this book, the ditficulties in the\nway of acceptance of such belief and the evidence in support of it\nare not discussed at any length in the text. The whole of the argu-\nment is based on the results of psychoanalytic research, and it may\nbe that only readers who are conversant with these results ^vill fully\ngrasp the significance of Freud's speculations. Some of the con-\nclusions arrived at are dependent upon the interpretation of data\nprovided by ethnological and historical research, and there will be\ncriticism of this work by those who do not accept the views of the\nwriters on whom Freud relies for his interpretations. Thus, for\nexample, he has l^een reproached for adhering to the description of\n\f350 Review [part 160]\nthe totem feast given by Robertson Smith (a man, by the way, who\nsuffered for his heretical opinions very mucli as Freud has suffered\nfor his), since later ethnologists have unanimously rejected Robert-\nson Smith's theories. But, Freud says : \"A new theory does not\nnecessarily denote progress. ... It was my good right to select from\nethnological data what would serve me for my analytic work.\"\nConvinced as he was of the truth of his own psycho-analytical\nfindings, he felt justified in adopting any views of competent investi-\ngators in other fields that are consonant with his own, whether these\nviews are generally accepted or not.\nMoses and Monotheism is a characteristic example of Freud's work\nboth as a thinker and a writer. It is well translated and has an\nadequate index. T. W.
