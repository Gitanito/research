Before she was two years old, Dilukshi Nissanka began to speak about a&nbsp;life in a village&nbsp;about eighty miles distant from her home, which ended when she drowned in a stream. She refused to address her parents as mother and father&nbsp;and asked to be taken to her previous mother. Most of her 22 statements about the previous life were verified.&nbsp;A documentary made of this case by Storyhouse Productions in Washington DC was shown worldwide.   Contents   \tDevelopment of the Case \tDilukshi\u2019s Statements \tVerifications \tEvaluation \tLiterature \tEndnotes     Development of the Case\n\nDilukshi was born in October 1984 in Veyangoda, Sri Lanka, and began&nbsp;to talk about a previous life at age two. Her parents tried in vain to get her to stop. When the girl was almost five years old, they gave up and asked the help of a relative, BA Sunil. He&nbsp;in turn contacted the Venerable&nbsp;Sumangala, an archaeologist and abbot of the Dambulla rock temple. Sumangala asked Sunil to write up a list of the statements that Dilukshi had been making, which he did from memory.&nbsp;With that list in hand, he made enquiries around Dambulla, but failed to find any deceased child that fit&nbsp;Dilukshi\u2019s statements.\n\nThe abbot then contacted a journalist he knew, HW Abeypala, who interviewed Dilukshi\u2019s parents and wrote an account in the Weekend newspaper; the item appeared on 10 September 1989. Dharmadasa Ranatunga in Dambulla read the report and recognized the statements as matching his deceased daughter Shiromi Inoka, who had drowned in a canal near their home in 1983 (almost exactly one year before Dilukshi was born). He wrote to Dilukshi\u2019s father and mailed a photocopy of the letter to Sumangala.\n\nThe Ranatunga family lives in a village in the Dambulla subdistrict, some eighty miles from Dilukshi\u2019s home in Veyangoda. Dilukshi\u2019s parents had no friends, relatives&nbsp;or other connections with Dambulla. Only once had they visited the famous Dambulla rock temple, as they were on their way back from a pilgrimage to Anuradhapura.\n\nA few days after Ranatunga contacted Dilkushi\u2019s parents, they took her to Dambulla, together with the journalist Abeypala. Sumangala and Ranatunga joined them there. Dilukshi gave the party directions to Ranatunga\u2019s house, some four miles from the town of Dambulla. There&nbsp;she recognized objects and persons to such a degree that the Ranatunga family accepted her as their former daughter.\n\nReincarnation researcher Erlendur Haraldsson learned about the case through an article in a Sri Lankan newspaper. He obtained the two documents that recorded Dilukshi\u2019s statements before the previous personality was sought&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;Sunil\u2019s letter to the abbot and Abeypala\u2019s article in Weekend&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;and re-interviewed the key witnesses. There are 22 items in the Weekend report and thirteen items in Sunil\u2019s letter. There are a few slight discrepancies between the lists, most likely due to the different circumstances in which the records were made.\n\nHaraldsson published a report of his investigation in a journal paper and later in a book, I Saw a Light and Came Here, which he co-authored with James Matlock.1&nbsp;Dilukshi Nissanka's story was also the subject of a the documentary&nbsp;Past Lives: Stories of Reincarnation  from Storyhouse Productions (Washington, DC).2  Dilukshi\u2019s Statements\n\nDilukshi\u2019s statements, as published in the Weekend newspaper were as follows:   \tMy mother lives in Peravatte in Dambulla. \tMy brother and I fell into the stream and I came here (was reborn). \tA stream with a footbridge over it skirts the paddy field near the house. \tOur house is near Heenkolla\u2019s boutique. \tWe used to buy provisions in Heenkolla\u2019s shop. \tThe roof of our house could be seen from the small Dambulla rock (punchi Dambulla gala). \tWe played on the smaller rock. I played shopkeeper (mudalali) in the boutique. There was a little doll in our boutique. \tOne day I climbed the Dambulla rock and my brother and I fell down. \tThere is a public drinking cistern (pinthaliya) at Dambulla temple. \tI went to school by van. \tFather took me in the van to school. \tI have friends and we have been in Colombo. \tMy father is owner of a metal quarry. \tFather is fair in complexion. \tMother is very fair. \tYounger brother (malle) is very dark. \tI was known as Suwanna. \tMy mother was named Swarna (I cannot remember my father\u2019s name). \tMy mother wears a housecoat with beautiful buttons. \tMy brothers, Mahesh (elder) and Thushara (younger) are waiting for me in our play boutique. \tTwo children fell into the stream while playing near the footbridge. \tMy mother is not like you, aunt (present mother). She loves me very much.   Verifications\n\n\u2018My mother lives in Perawatte in Dambulla.\u2019 Sumangala learned that no village existed by the name of Perawatte, which literally means a gova fruit (pera) garden (watte). However, Mrs Ranatunga told Haraldsson that her daughter had sometimes called her home Perawatte because of the number of fruit trees growing there. Mr Ranatunga said there were a number of gova trees at a house close by. Also, a young relative named Wimala Amarakone, who lived with the family for two years and who was very close to Shiromi, said that Shiromi always insisted on going through the place she called Perawatte on the way home from school, when the gova trees were bearing fruit. She, and only she, had called this place Perawatte.\n\nHaraldsson visited this place, which is close by and has many gova trees. Hence, it seemed Dilukshi was using a description used in the previous life, not&nbsp;its proper name.\n\n\u2018My brother and I fell into the stream and I came here (was reborn)\u2019. Shiromi died by drowning in a nearby stream, or canal, which is about three yards wide. On that day, Wimala Amarakone and five or six other children were with her at the canal, bathing and washing linen. Later, Wimala noticed that Shiromi had disappeared, and a few hours later, she was found drowned at the bottom of the canal. Shiromi knew how to swim and it was assumed that she had fallen on a rock that protrudes into the stream and lost consciousness; an injury was found on her head. Manju Siri, Shiromi\u2019s three-year-old brother, had been at the canal at the time, but is not known to have fallen in. &nbsp;\n\n\u2018A stream with a footbridge over it skirts the paddyfield near the house.\u2019 At the time of the accident there had been a footbridge, slightly upstream and opposite Ranatunga\u2019s paddyfields, although this had been replaced since.\n\n\u2018Our house is near Heenkolla\u2019s boutique. ... We used to buy provisions in Heenkolla\u2019s shop\u2019.\n\nThere is a house with a small shop as one leaves the footpath near Ranatunga\u2019s house, entering the road that leads to the main road and the school. It had closed because of lack of business five months before Haraldsson first visited the area. A brother of the shopkeeper, Mr Jayadara, told us that his younger brother Anura Siri had been nicknamed Heen Malle (thin younger brother) since he was a boy. Shiromi might have called the shop Heenkolla\u2019s boutique, or the shop of the thin boy (kolla means boy in Singalese).\n\nWe were shown the license for the shop, which was issued on 6 November 1977. It sold groceries, was located directly on the road and was the only shop that Shiromi passed on her way to school. In short, this is a specific fit. In 1990, Haraldsson met Heen Malle, then a slender man aged 27. He said he remembered Shiromi making purchases there.\n\n\u2018My mother lives in Perawatte in Dambulla. \u2026 She lived near Dambulla\u2019. Both statements mention Dambulla, one that she lived near Dambulla, the other that she lived in Perawatte in Dambulla. Both statements indicate that she lived not in Dambulla town but rather in the Dambulla subdistrict. The fact that Shiromi had lived near Dambulla but not in Dambulla town makes for a better fit with Dilukshi\u2019s statements than if the reverse had been the case.\n\nAnother example of childlike name giving, similar to Perewatte, can be found in the second item on Sunil\u2019s list, where Dilukshi states that her father had a large stone quarry in Dodamwatte (garden of oranges). Shiromi\u2019s father works in a tile factory in Anuradhapura, where oranges are grown.\n\n\u2018The roof of our house could be seen from the small Dambulla rock\u2019. Some forty yards from Ranatunga\u2019s house is a large, relatively flat rock, less than a yard high. Shiromi\u2019s mother \u2013 and independently her sister Wimala \u2013 told us that Shiromi had called it \u2018the small Dambulla rock\u2019 and often played there with her younger brother. Haraldsson verified that from that rock the roof of their house could be seen between some trees and bushes. This rock is the only one of its kind near the house.\n\n\u2018We played on the smaller rock. I played shopkeeper in our boutique. There was a little doll in our boutique\u2019.&nbsp;According to Shiromi\u2019s mother her children had often played on the low rock near the house&nbsp;and also played 'boutique'.\n\n\u2018One day I climbed the Dambulla rock and my brother and&nbsp;I fell down'. According to Shiromi\u2019s parents, this may well have happened: They often visited the Dambulla rock temple, walking up the long footpath and the many steps that lead up the ancient temple, which is hewn into the slope of the boulder-like rock that can be seen from far away and from which there is a beautiful view of the surrounding countryside. However, it is unlikely that parents would remember whether their children once slipped on these steps many years earlier, unless it resulted in lasting injuries.\n\n\u2018There is a public drinking cistern at Dambulla temple\u2019. According to Shiromi\u2019s parents, and also Sumangala, there was a drinking cistern near the start of the path to the temple, placed there by a family that lived close by. This item reveals knowledge of a specific fact.\n\n\u2018I went to school by van. Father took me in the van to school\u2019. Shiromi\u2019s father did not own a van. The husband of a sister of Shiromi\u2019s mother lives in Kalugala some one hundred miles away and owns a van. He and his family visited the Ranatungas from time to time and might have taken Shiromi to school by the van. They would often take the children home with them during school holidays. Shortly before Shiromi drowned they had, according to Wimala, taken her to their home during holidays.\n\n\u2018I have friends and we have been to Colombo\u2019. According to Shiromi\u2019s parents, they once went with Shiromi to faraway Colombo when she was four or five years old.\n\n\u2018My father is owner of a metal quarry. \u2026 My father has a large stone quarry in Dodamwatte\u2019. Shiromi\u2019s father is a chief clerk in a tile factory in Anuradhapura. Mr Ranatunga works in a tile factory, which is a different kind of an enterprise, but for a child the difference might be small or none, depending on how much she knew about these products. According to Sunil, Dilukshi had used the words \u2018a place where work is being done on stones\u2019, not the word \u2018quarry\u2019, which was his and her parents\u2019 interpretation of what she meant.\n\n\u2018Father is fair in complexion. Mother was very fair, younger brother is very dark\u2019. To Haraldsson and his interpreter there was no obvious difference in the complexions of Mr and Mrs Ranatunga and their son, which seemed similar to the average Sinhalese.\n\n\u2018She (Dilukshi) was known as Suwanna\u2019. The given name of Mr Ranatunga\u2019s daughter was Shiromi Inoka, which is quite different from Suwanna, although both names start with an \u2018s\u2019 sound.\n\n\u2018My mother was Swarna (I cannot remember my father's name).\u2019 The name of Shiromi\u2019s mother is Zeila, which obviously is different from Swarna, although again both words begin with an \u2018s\u2019 sound. According to Shiromi\u2019s family, there is no one of that name among their neighbours.\n\n\u2018My mother wears a housecoat with beautiful buttons\u2019. Shiromi\u2019s mother told Haraldsson that this was correct. She had used, and still uses, a dress called a housecoat, which according to Haraldsson's&nbsp;interpreter and colleague Godwin Samararatne is not commonly worn by women in this area.\n\n\u2018My brothers, Mahesh (elder) and Thushara (younger), are waiting for me in our boutique\u2019.&nbsp;Shiromi was the eldest child of the Ranatunga family. She had a brother seven years younger named Manju Siri. According to Shiromi\u2019s mother, she used to take care of her younger brother and spent much time with him. Dilukshi\u2019s mother stated that Dilukshi mentioned her younger brother more often than anything else. The name of Shiromi\u2019s brother, Manju Siri, is quite different from Mahesh or Thushara. Shiromi\u2019s mother told us that there had been a boy living in the next house by the name of Mahesh, who had moved away; and Shiromi had called him malle (younger brother). Haraldsson succeeded in tracing this boy in Rambukkana, some fifty miles away. His given name was in fact Saman, and he was usually called Nandalage Malle (aunt\u2019s younger brother). Shiromi had also had a school friend by the name of Thushara. Both these names are relatively common.\n\n\u2018Two children fell into the stream while playing near the footbridge.\u2019 No verification was found for this, but it may easily have happened.\n\n\u2018My mother is not like you, aunt (present mother). She loves me very much\u2019. Dilukshi refered to her present mother as \u2018aunt\u2019 and spoke of her mother in the previous life as her real mother.&nbsp;She refused to call her parents mother and father and requested to be taken to her earlier mother. This is rather common with children who recall past lives.\n\n\u2018On the road near the house goes the bus to Sigiriya\u2019. This reveals specific knowledge of the area, for the road to Sigiriya splits off from the main road to Anuradhapura near the home of the Ranatunga family.\n\n\u2018Father had plenty of money\u2019. Shiromi\u2019s father was not poor by Sinhalese standards, but he certainly did not have an abundance of money. This item is probably of little value: a child\u2019s assessment of her parents\u2019 money situation, unless it is extreme, is likely to be inaccurate. &nbsp;\n\n\u2018She was in fifth grade\u2019. Shiromi was in the third grade when she drowned.\n\n\u2018In the house there are two dogs\u2019. According to Shiromi\u2019s mother, they had two dogs at this time.\n\nIn the interview with Dilukshi\u2019s mother, some additional statements came up that are not found in the Weekend nor in Sunil\u2019s letter. One was, \u2018There were dark patches in the stream\u2019. Haraldsson found such dark patches in the canal (stream) due to some almost black looking growth at the bottom.\n\n\u2018We had a mosquito net in the bedroom\u2019. This was verified by Shiromi\u00b4s mother but is uncommon in poor households in Sri Lanka. Haraldsson and Samararatne were shown mosquito nets hanging in the bedroom.  Evaluation\n\nCan any person be identified who corresponds to Dilukshi\u2019s statements? Haraldsson identified only one candidate, Shiromi, who died one year and a week before Dilukshi was born.\n\nDiluksihi's&nbsp;statements differ widely in potential verifiability. Some concern objective facts and are either right or wrong. Others, such as whether Shiromi played boutique, had a doll, or slipped on the way up to the Dambulla temple, are either so general that they might fit almost any child or are such minor events that they are unlikely to have been remembered by witnesses.\n\nAttempting to assess the 22 items that seem potentially verifiable, Haraldsson concluded that twelve of them (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 19 in the list above) correspond exactly or partially with Shiromi\u2019s life, whereas four (15, 16, 18, and 20) were definitely wrong. The rest may or may not be correct.\n\nThis was similar to what Haraldsson had seen in other reincarnation cases he had studied. Items about location and places fare well, as well as the mode of death, which is typically a violent and early death. Rejection of the present parents is common among these cases, also the difficulty experienced by the parents in trying to stop their child to talking about the previous life. The case of Dilukshi Nissanka is particularly significant, as the child\u2019s statements were recorded before any attempt was made to verify them.\n\nErlendur Haraldsson  Literature\n\nHaraldsson, E.
