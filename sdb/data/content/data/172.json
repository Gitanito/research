He worked as a photographer and wrote fiction for American sci-fi magazines (Wonder Stories). Besides psychical research, he was deeply interested in archeology and mythology.  Psychical Research\n\nHerbert joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1931. After World War II, together with RG Medhurst, he took part in s\u00e9ances for physical and mental phenomena in his home in Chelsea, followed by sittings at Richmond in the 1960s.1 He is said at these sessions often to have gone into into trance and displayed mediumistic traits.2 This direct participation was viewed with suspicion by other researchers, &nbsp;who were further concerned about his fraternization with self-professed \u2018witches\u2019, ufologists and students of the occult.3\n\nHerbert left London in 1966 and moved to an isolated farmhouse in Downton, Wiltshire where he founded the Paraphysical Laboratory (Paralab). The quiet environment was more suited to his experiments into the electrical phenomena that he believed to be the source of psychokinesis, telepathy, psychotronics and suchlike.\n\nThe same year he was invited to investigate the allegedly haunted Tudor manor Sandford Orcas in Dorset with other Paralab researchers, concluding that \u2018there is a prima facie case for the house being haunted\u2019.4&nbsp;\n\nIn the 1970s he experimented with psychokinesis and dermal optics, testing Suzanne Padfield, who he believed possessed psychometric and astral projection capabilities. Other of his experiments were reproduced in The Legend of the Witches, a film about modern-day witchcraft.\n\nHerbert and his SPR colleague Manfred Cassirer embraced the study of psi in Soviet east European countries. They attended a symposium on psychotronics in Prague in September 1970, and this led to further contacts with scientific researchers in Russia, Czechoslavakia and other countries in the region. Herbert was a founder-member of the International Association of Psychotronic Research founded by Zden\u011bk Rejd\u00e1k.5 Subsequent correspondence led to his self-published Journal of Paraphysics with the aid of Cassirer and ufologist Margaret Driver.\n\nIn July 1972 and again in 1973,&nbsp;Herbert&nbsp;and Cassirer travelled to Leningrad to film psychokinetic abilities demonstrated by Ninel&nbsp;Kulagina.6  Works  Novels\n\nCrisis! 1992 (1936).
