There, he obtained a BA in 1922 and an MA in 1926, studying spectroscopy (the study of the absorption and emission of light and radiation by matter) under Thomas Merton. He lectured in physics at Queen\u2019s University, Belfast between 1923 and 1926. He was awarded a BSc in physics at London University, a PhD in 1924 and a DSc in 1927, following which he was appointed a lecturer there. He later wrote numerous papers and a book on molecular spectra.2 He also began a medical course, having become interested in psychotherapy.\n\nIn 1934 Johnson was appointed Master of Queen\u2019s College, University of Melbourne, where he remained until his retirement in 1964.\n\nContact with religious figures on a 1962 visit to India fed Johnson\u2019s growing interest in spirituality and mysticism. Now nearing retirement, he and his wife committed themselves to a life of meditation at their home in the Dandenong Ranges, a mountain range in Australia. Here he hosted regular meditation meetings led by Anne Hamilton-Byrne, a neighbour who shared his interest and with whom he is said to have become \u2018besotted\u2019.3 &nbsp;Hamilton-Byrne was later exposed as the leader of a secretive cult, known as The Family, mired in scandal when many of the 28 children it had \u2018adopted\u2019 were found to have been acquired by means of forged papers. Johnson was not involved in the subsequent criminal charges against Hamilton-Byrne and her collaborators, but was distressed by his association with the cult.4  Psychical Research\n\nJohnson became interested in psychical research during his time in Australia. He came to believe that although paranormal phenomena could not be proved, there was sufficient evidence to suggest its extreme likelihood. His 1953 book The Imprisoned Splendour contains eight chapters devoted to the topic. In reviews, RH Thouless called this \u2018a very adequate summary of recent work in this field\u2019,5 while HH Price considered it offered \u2018an original contribution to the theoretical interpretation of the facts\u2019.6\n\nPsychical Research (1955), a book wholly devoted to research into paranormal phenomena, was published as part of the popular \u2018Teach Yourself\u2019 series.  Survival of Death\n\nOn a visit to England in 1953 he met Geraldine Cummins, an Irish medium, who later sent him material that she had received by automatic writing that purported to originate with Ambrose Pratt, a recently-deceased Australian novelist, politician and businessman whom Johnson had known intimately. Pratt, whom Johnson considered a man of considerable integrity as well as talent, appeared to wish to communicate to him the fact of his having survived death, providing abundant details about himself and his life and interests, to an extent, Johnson felt certain, that Cummins could not have known about by normal means. This is laid out in detail in Johnson\u2019s 1988 book The Decisive Testimony.  Fawcett\u2019s \u2018Imaginism\u2019\n\nIn his communications through Cummins, \u2018Pratt\u2019 indicated that the best extant description of ultimate reality was the philosophy of Imaginism, as described by Douglas Fawcett, a British mountaineer and science fiction novelist with a background in the Theosophical movement. \u2018Pratt\u2019 stated that he and a group of likeminded deceased individuals, which included FWH Myers, were convinced that Fawcett\u2019s ideas needed to be promoted to the widest possible public, and he urged Johnson to undertake the task. This is the origin of Johnson\u2019s 1957 book Nurslings of Immortality, a discussion of Fawcett\u2019s Imaginism. &nbsp;  Mysticism\n\nJohnson\u2019s interests extended to mystical experience, which he considered an opening to the discovery of ultimate truth.7 His 1959 book Watcher on the Hills is a detailed analysis and evaluation of first-hand reports of such experiences that had been given to him over the years. In the preface he writes:  \n\nOne reason why I have written his book is to show how absurd it is to suppose that the only evidence to be weighed is that which our five senses provide. The human mind, which in all of us daily receives and interprets the evidence of the senses, also receives from time to time intimations, insights, moments of illumination, and occasionally vivid experiences, which are felt to be of the greatest significance by the percipient. This is evidence which has to be weighed carefully if we are in earnest to understand the world. I am not now thinking of psychical phenomena, but of experiences of a much deeper kind which can be differentiated from them.8   Selected Publications\n\nAn Introduction to Molecular Spectra (1949).
