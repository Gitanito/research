Bela Marsh (1797-1869) was a Boston publisher who went on to become one of the leading spiritualist publishers in the early days of the movement, publishing notably works of Allen Putnam, Andrew Jackson Davis, Warren Chase, P.B. Randolph, Adin Ballou, and others.  His bookshop on Cornhill Street, Boston, advertised itself as the depot for physiological, phrenological, water-cure, reform\/anti-slavery, and spiritualist works.  LOC; Koln ZBMedizin.
